760. 第3节 基督教会的末期就是先前教会终结时所处的黑夜<p>自创世以来, 总的来说, 地球上相继出现四个教会, 这一点可从既是历史体又是预言体的圣言看出来, 尤其是但以理书。 这四个教会在此先通过尼布甲尼撒梦见的雕像 (第2章), 后通过海中上来的四个大兽来描述 (第7章)。 第一个教会, 即所谓的最古老教会, 存在于大洪水前; 它的终结或毁灭被描述为大洪水。 第二个教会, 即所谓的远古教会, 则出现在亚洲和部分非洲地区; 它由于偶像崇拜而终结和灭亡。 第三个是以色列教会, 从在西奈山上宣布十诫开始, 通过摩西和先知所写的圣言延续下去, 该教会由于亵渎圣言走到尽头并终结; 在主降世的那一刻, 这亵渎达到顶点, 结果, 他们将本为圣言的主钉死在十字架上。 第四个是主藉福音书和使徒建立的基督教会。 该教会可分为两个时期, 一个是从主的时代到尼西亚公会, 另一个则从那公会直到现在; 但在发展过程中, 它被分裂成三个: 希腊教会, 罗马天主教和改革宗。 然而, 所有这些教会都被称为基督教会。 此外, 每个宽范的教会中还有大量特殊教会; 尽管从主流分离出来, 但它们仍保留通称, 如基督教会里的各种异端。 </p>

760. This, the Christian Church's Final Hour, Is the Same Kind of Night in Which the Former Churches Came to an End
<p>Since creation first took place, there have been four churches on this planet, one after the other. Both the historical and the prophetic Word make this clear. It is especially clear in Daniel, where these four churches are described in the form of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar saw in a dream (Daniel 2); later on they are portrayed as the four beasts that rose up from the sea (Daniel 7).
<p>The first church, which should be called the earliest church, existed before the Flood; the Flood itself symbolically depicts the end and demise of that church. The second church, which should be called the early church, existed in the Middle East and also in parts of North Africa; it came to a close and perished as the result of various forms of idolatry. The third church was the Israelite church. It began with the issuing of the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai and was further established through the Word that was written by Moses and the prophets. It came to a close and was brought to an end by people's desecration of the Word, which desecration reached a peak at the time that the Lord came into the world. Because of it, the people crucified the One who was the Word. The fourth church is the Christian church that was established by the Lord through the Gospel writers and the apostles. There were two phases of this church: the first lasted from the time of the Lord until the Council of Nicaea; the second lasted from then until the present day. Along the way, however, the church split into three main parts: the Greek, the Roman Catholic, and the Protestant; nevertheless, all three are referred to as Christian. Within each of these parts, there were also many individual movements that broke away and yet retained the name of the parent body; they became heresies within the Christian church. </p>

760. III. This final period of the Christian church is absolute night, in which the previous churches ended.<p>Since the creation of this earth there have been, to speak in general terms, four churches, each succeeding the one before. This can be established from the historical as well as the prophetical books of the Word, especially the book of Daniel. Here the four churches are described by the statue Nebuchadnezzar saw in a dream (chapter 2), and later by the four beasts coming up out of the sea (chapter 7). The first church, which may be called the Most Ancient Church, came into existence before the flood, and its ending or departure is described by the flood. The second church, which may be called the Ancient Church, was in Asia and in parts of Africa; this came to an end and perished as the result of idolatrous practices. The third was the Israelite Church, begun by the proclamation of the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai, and continued through the Word written by Moses and the Prophets. This came to an end and terminated as the result of profaning the Word, a process which reached its full development at the time the Lord came into the world. That was why they crucified Him who was the Word. The fourth is the Christian Church founded by the Lord by means of the Evangelists and the Apostles. This has had two phases: one from the Lord's time down to the Council of Nicaea, the other from that Council down to the present day. But in its development it split into three, the Greek, Roman Catholic and Reformed Churches. Yet all of these have been called Christian churches. Moreover, within each wide division of the church there have been a number of special churches; despite leaving the main stream they have still kept the general name, as heresies in the Christian church. </p>

760. III. THIS LAST TIME OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH IS THE VERY NIGHT IN WHICH FORMER CHURCHES HAVE COME TO AN END. <p>That there have been in general four churches on this earth since its creation, one after the other, can be seen from both the historic and the prophetic Word, especially in Daniel, where these four churches are pictured by the statue which Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream (chap. 2), and afterward by the four beasts coming up out of the sea (chap. 7). The first, which should be called the Most Ancient church, existed before the flood; and its consummation or destruction is pictured by the flood. The second, which should be called the Ancient church, existed in Asia, and a part of it in Africa; it was consummated and destroyed by idolatries. The third church was the Israelitish, which began with the promulgation of the Decalogue upon Mount Sinai, was continued by means of the Word written by Moses and the prophets, and was consummated or brought to an end by the profanation of the Word; which profanation was complete at the time of the Lord's coming into the world; and in consequence they crucified Him who was the Word. The fourth is the Christian church, which was established by the Lord through the evangelists and apostles. Of this church there have been two epochs, one extending from the Lord's time to the Council of Nice, and the other from that Council to the present day; but in its progress it has been divided into three - the Greek, the Roman Catholic, and the Reformed. All these, however, are called Christian churches. Furthermore, within each of these general churches there have been a number of particular churches; and these, in spite of their secession, have retained the general name, as heresies in the Christian church. </p>

760. III. THIS LAST PHASE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH IS NIGHT ITSELF, IN WHICH THE FORMER CHURCHES CAME TO AN END.<p>Since the creation, there have been on this earth four Churches in general, following one another in regular succession. This may be evident from both the historical and the prophetical parts of the Word, especially from the Book of Daniel, where the four Churches are described by the statue that Nebuchadnezzar saw in a dream, chapter <a href="3927/daniel_2_1.htm">2</a>, and afterwards by the four beasts coming up out of the sea, chapter <a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">7</a>. The first church, which may be called the Most Ancient, existed before the Flood, and its consummation or end is described by the Flood. The second Church, which may be called the Ancient, existed in Asia and part of Africa; and this reached its consummation and perished by idolatries. The third Church, which was the Israelitish, began with the promulgation of the Decalogue on Mount Sinai, was continued by the Word written by Moses and the Prophets, and reached its consummation or end by the profanation of the Word. This profanation was complete when the Lord came into the world; and, therefore, because He was the Word, they crucified Him. The fourth Church is the Christian, which the Lord established by the Evangelists and the Apostles. Of this Church there have been two epochs, one extending from the time of the Lord to the Council of Nice, <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
and the other from that Council to the present time. This Church, however, in its progress was divided into three branches, the Greek, the Roman Catholic and the Reformed; nevertheless, all these three are called Christian. Moreover, within each general Church there have been several particular Churches which, although they have seceded, have still retained the name from the general Church, like heresies in the Christian Church.<p>

760. Quod Ultimum hoc tempus Ecclesiae Christianae, sit ipsa Nox, in quam desierunt Ecclesiae priores.<p>Quod in hac Tellure post Creationem ejus fuerint quatuor Ecclesiae in Communi, quarum una successit alteri, constare potest ex Verbo tam Historico quam Prophetico, imprimis apud Danielem; apud hunc quatuor illae Ecclesiae describuntur per Statuam Nebuchadnezari visam in somnio, Cap. <a href="3927/daniel_2_1.htm">2</a>; et postea per quatuor Bestias e mari ascendentes, Cap. <a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">7</a> Prima Ecclesia, quae vocanda est Antiquissima, ante diluvium exstitit, cujus Consummatio seu exitus describitur per Diluvium: Altera Ecclesia, quae vocanda est Antiqua, fuit in Asia, et quoad partem in Africa, quae Consummata est et periit per Idololatrias. Tertia Ecclesia erat Israelitica, incepta a promulgatione Decalogi super Monte Sinai, et continuata per Verbum a Mose et Prophetis conscriptum, et consummata seu finita per prophanationem Verbi, cujus plenitudo fuit tempore, quo Dominus in Mundum venit, quare Ipsum, qui fuit Verbum, crucifixerunt. Quarta Ecclesia est Christiana a Domino per Evangelistas et Apostolos instaurata; hujus binae Epochae fuerunt, una a tempore Domini usque ad Concilium Nicaenum, et altera ab illo Concilio usque ad hodiernum <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
