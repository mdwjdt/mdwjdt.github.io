495. All the freedom that comes from the Lord is true freedom. The freedom in us that comes from hell is slavery. To someone in hellish freedom, however, spiritual freedom inevitably looks like slavery, because the two are opposites. Nevertheless, all people who are in spiritual freedom know and even sense that hellish freedom is slavery. To angels that freedom is therefore as repulsive as the stench of a corpse, but hellish spirits breathe it in like an intoxicating perfume.
<p>As the Lord's Word makes clear, worship that takes place in a state of freedom is true worship, and what is spontaneous is pleasing to the Lord. This is why it says in David, "I will sacrifice to God willingly" (<a href="3927/psalms_54_6.htm">Psalms 54:6</a>); and "The willing among the people have gathered, the people of the God of Abraham" (<a href="3927/psalms_47_9.htm">Psalms 47:9</a>). This is why the children of Israel made freewill offerings (their holy worship consisted principally in sacrifices). Because of God's pleasure in what is spontaneous they were commanded that "Every man whose heart impels him, and everyone whose willing spirit moves him, should bring a freewill offering to Jehovah for the work of the tent [of meeting]" (<a href="3927/exodus_35_5.htm">Exodus 35:5</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_35_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_35_29.htm">29</a>). And the Lord says, "If you remain in my Word you are truly my disciples. And you will know the truth and the truth will set you free. If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be truly free. Everyone who commits sin, though, is a slave of sin" (<a href="3927/john_8_31.htm">John 8:31-36</a>). </p>

495. Any freedom coming from the Lord is real freedom; but any that comes from hell and makes itself at home with a person is slavery. Still spiritual freedom must inevitably seem like slavery to anyone who enjoys the freedom of hell, since they are opposites. Yet all who enjoy spiritual freedom not only know but feel that the freedom of hell is slavery. The angels therefore shun it like the stench of a corpse, though those in hell sniff it as if it were a perfume. It is well known from the Lord's Word that worship freely given is true worship, and what is offered willingly is pleasing to the Lord. That is why we read in the Psalms of David:<p>I will make a free will offering to God, <a href="3927/psalms_54_6.htm">Psalms 54:6</a>.<p>and in another place:<p>The willing ones of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham, <a href="3927/psalms_47_9.htm">Psalms 47:9</a>.<p>For this reason the Children of Israel had free-will sacrifices. Their chief mode of sacred worship consisted of sacrifices. Because free-will offerings are pleasing to God they were instructed that every man who was impelled by his heart or moved by his own volition should bring a choice offering to Jehovah for the making of the Tabernacle (<a href="3927/exodus_35_5.htm">Exodus 35:5</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_35_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_35_29.htm">29</a>).<p>And the Lord says:<p>If you remain faithful to my word, you are truly my disciples; and you will recognise the truth, and the truth makes you free. If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be truly free. But anyone who commits sin is the slave of sin, <a href="3927/john_8_31.htm">John 8:31-36</a>. </p>

495. All freedom that is from the Lord is freedom indeed, but that which is from hell, and in man therefrom, is bondage. Yet to one who is in infernal freedom spiritual freedom must needs appear like bondage, because the two are opposite. But all who are in spiritual freedom not only know, but also see, that infernal freedom is bondage; and the angels therefore turn away from that freedom as from a cadaverous stench, while infernal spirits draw it in like an aromatic odor. It is known from the Lord's Word that worship from freedom is truly worship, and that spontaneity is pleasing to the Lord; therefore it is said in David: <p>I will freely sacrifice unto God (<a href="3927/psalms_54_6.htm">Psalms 54:6</a>). <p>The willing ones of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham (<a href="3927/psalms_47_9.htm">Psalms 47:9</a>). <p>Therefore there were free will offerings among the children of Israel; their sacred worship consisted chiefly of sacrifices, and because of God's pleasure in what is spontaneous, it was commanded: <p>That every man whose heart impelled him, and everyone whose willing spirit moved him, should bring an offering to Jehovah for the work of the tabernacle (<a href="3927/exodus_35_5.htm">Exodus 35:5</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_35_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_35_29.htm">29</a>). <p>And the Lord says: <p>If ye abide in My Word, ye are truly My disciples; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be truly free. But everyone that committeth sin is the servant of sin (<a href="3927/john_8_31.htm">John 8:31-36</a>). </p>

495. All freedom which is derived from the Lord is freedom itself, but that derived from hell and received thence by man, is servitude. Spiritual freedom, however, can only appear as servitude to one who is in infernal freedom, because they are opposites; nevertheless, all who are in spiritual freedom not only know but also understand that infernal freedom is servitude. Angels, therefore, hold it in aversion like the stench from a corpse, while the infernals welcome it as a fragrant perfume. It is well known from the Word of the Lord that worship from freedom is true worship, and that voluntary worship is pleasing to the Lord. It is, therefore, said in David:<p>"I will freely sacrifice" unto God. <a href="3927/psalms_54_6.htm">Psalms 54:6</a>.<p>"The willing among the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham" <a href="3927/psalms_47_9.htm">Psalms 47:9</a>.<p>Hence among the Children of Israel there were free-will sacrifices; and their sacred worship consisted principally in sacrifices. Because God is well pleased with what is voluntary it was enjoined:<p>That every man whose heart stirred him and every one whose willing spirit moved him, should bring the Lord's offering for the work of the tabernacle. <a href="3927/exodus_35_5.htm">Exodus 35:5</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_35_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_35_29.htm">29</a>;<p>and the Lord says:<p>"If ye continue in my Word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free... If the Son, therefore, shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin" <a href="3927/john_8_31.htm">John 8:31-36</a>. </p>

495. Omne Liberum, quod a Domino est, est ipsum Liberum, at quod ab inferno est et inde apud hominem, est servum; at usque non potest aliter, quam quod Liberum spirituale illi qui in Libero infernali est, appareat ut servum, quia sunt opposita; attamen omnes, qui in Libero spirituali sunt, non modo sciunt, sed etiam percipiunt, quod Liberum infernale servum sit, quare Angeli aversantur hoc sicut nidorem cadaverosum, at Infernales illud idem attrahunt sicut odorem aromaticum. Notum est ex Verbo Domini, quod Cultus ex libero sit vere cultus, et quod spontaneum Domino placeat, quare dicitur apud Davidem, Voluntarium sacrificabo Deo, Psalm 54:8: <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
et alibi, Spontanei populorum congregati <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
sunt, populus Dei Abrahami, Psalm 47:10; <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
inde apud Filios Israelis erant Sacrificia Spontanea; sacer illorum Cultus principaliter consistebat in sacrificiis; propter beneplacitum Dei in spontaneis mandatum est, Quod omnis vir, quem impulit cor ejus, et omnis, cujus spontaneus spiritus movit illum, adduceret therumam Jehovae ad opus Tentorii, <a href="3927/exodus_35_5.htm">Exodus 35:5</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_35_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_35_29.htm">29</a>; et Dominus dicit, "Si vos manseritis in Verbo meo, vere discipuli mei estis; et cognoscetis veritatem, et veritas liberos facit vos; si ergo Filius vos liberos facit, vere liberi eritis; omnis autem faciens peccatum, servus peccati est," <a href="3927/john_8_31.htm">Johannes 8:31-36</a>. <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
