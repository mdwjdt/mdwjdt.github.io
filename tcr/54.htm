<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第54节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>54</b>.然而，要阐明创造宇宙时施加于它的秩序的性质需要花费大量篇幅。下面有关创世的几节内容（75－80节）会给出该主题的大体轮廓。必须牢记，宇宙中的每一个事物都是按自己的秩序被造的，以使它能自行持续存在。它从一开始就承受这秩序，是为了与整个宇宙的秩序相联结，以便每个具体秩序能作为总体结构的部分而持续存在，因而与全体合而为一。<br />举几个例子。人是按他自己的秩序被造的，所以他的每一个部分也是按自己的秩序被造的；如头、躯体、心、肺、肝、胰、胃等都有各自的秩序；被称为肌肉的每一个运动器官有自己的秩序；每个感觉器官，如眼、耳、舌也有自己的秩序；没有自己秩序的血管或纤维根本就不存在；然而，这些无数部分与整个身体联结起来，并将自己安插在它里面，以便全体合而为一。所有其它事物也一样，仅仅列举一下就足以说明。地上的每个走兽、空中的每只飞鸟、海里的每条鱼，每个爬行动物，甚至每条虫子直到飞蛾，都有自己的秩序。每一树木、矮树丛、灌木和菜蔬也有自己的秩序；而且，每块石头、每种金属，直至每一粒微尘同样有自己的秩序。</p>

54. 上帝在創世時放置於宇宙及其萬物中的定規的類型如何, 這需要大量篇幅來解釋。(下一個關於創世的標題中, 在<a href="75.htm">75-80</a>節會有一些概述)。
<p>有一點需要明白:宇宙中每一樣和所有的事物都是按其定規被造, 為的是它們能持續存在。這發生在最初之時, 為了讓每個細節能成為宇宙總體定規的一部分, 也讓個別的定規持續存在於總體定規之中, 全部合為一。
<p>舉些例子說明:人按各自的定規被造, 人體的每個組成部分也是按其各自的定規被造。頭有其自身的定規, 身也有。心臟,肺,肝,胰,胃等都有其自身的定規。運動器官的每一條肌肉有其自身的定規, 感覺器官中的眼,耳,舌都有其自身的定規。實際上, 身體中沒有一根血管或一條纖維缺少自身的定規。然而這些無數的組成部分都與總體的定規有聯繫,並且聯結起來, 以至於它們形成一個總體的定規。
<p>這同樣可應用到其它事物上, 下面這個簡略的清單就能說明問題。地上所有的動物, 空中所有的飛鳥, 海中所有魚類, 所有的爬蟲, 實際上, 甚至下至蛆類的所有昆蟲各有自己的定規。類似的, 所有樹木,灌木,矮樹叢,還有蔬菜等等, 都有自己的定規。此外, 所有的石頭,所有的金屬,甚至下至所有的泥土都有各自的定規。 </p>

54. Explaining the type of design that was built into the universe at creation would take many volumes. (A little sketch of it will appear under the next subheading, on creation [<a href="75.htm">75-80</a>]).
<p>One point that needs to be understood is this: Each and every thing in the universe was created with its own design so that it would continue to exist on its own. This happened from the very beginning so that each thing could become part of the overall design of the universe. The purpose is that the individual designs shall continue to exist within the universal design so that all are one.
<p>Now for some examples. The human being was created with a design of its own, and also each individual part of a human being was created with a design of its own. The head has its own design, the body has its. The heart, the lungs, the liver, the pancreas, and the stomach have their own designs. Every organ of motion called a muscle has its own design. Every organ of sensation, such as the eye, the ear, and the tongue, has its own design. In fact, there is not a capillary or a fibril in the human body that lacks its own design. Yet all these countless parts connect with the overall design and join up with it in such a way that together they form one overall design.
<p>The same applies to all other things. A mere list of them is enough for illustration. Every animal on land, every bird in the sky, every fish in the sea, every reptile, in fact, every insect even down to a grub has its own design built in from creation. Likewise every tree, shrub, bush, and vegetable has its own design. Furthermore, every stone and every mineral, even down to every type of dust on the earth has its own design. </p>

54. To expound the nature, however, of the order imposed on the universe at its creation would demand many pages. The following section on Creation [<a href="75.htm">75-80</a>] will attempt an outline sketch of this topic. It must be grasped that everything in the universe has been endowed by creation with its own order, so that it may continue in existence by itself. This order was imposed from the beginning in order to link up with the order of the universe, so that each particular order should continue in existence as part of the universal structure and thus be one with them. Let us proceed to a few examples.<p>Man is endowed by creation with his own order, and so is each and every part of him; the head has its order, the body its, the heart, the lungs, the liver, the pancreas, the stomach each its own; likewise every organ of movement called a muscle, and every organ of sense, as the eye, the ear or the tongue. To be sure, there is not a single little blood-vessel or minor fibre in the body which has not its own proper order. Yet all these countless parts are joined to the body as a whole and are so linked into it as to make one together with them. The same is true of all other things, which it will be enough to list as an illustration. Every land animal, every bird of the air, every fish of the sea, every creeping thing, even every worm down to a grub has by creation its own order. Equally every tree, bush, shrub and vegetable has its; and so moreover has every stone, every mineral, right down to each single particle of dust. </p>

54. It would require many pages to explain the nature of the order into which the universe was created. A sketch of it will be given in a following section on the Creation [n. <a href="75.htm">75</a>. It must be borne in mind that each and all things in the universe, that they might subsist by themselves, were created each into its own order, and in the beginning were so created as to conjoin themselves with the order of the whole universe, to the end that each particular order might have subsistence in the universal, and thus all might make one. But to refer to some examples-Man was created into his own order, and every part of him into its own order; as the head into its order, the body into its order; the heart, lungs, liver, pancreas, and stomach, each into its order; every organ of motion, called a muscle, into its order; and every organ of sense, as the eye, the ear, the tongue, into its order; nor does there exist any least artery or fiber there that has not its own order; and yet these innumerable parts join themselves with the common body, and so insert themselves in it that all together make one. The same is true of other things, the mere mention of which will suffice for illustration. Every beast of the earth, every bird of heaven, every fish of the sea, every reptile, and every worm, even to the moth, has been created into its own order; equally so every forest tree and fruit tree, every shrub and plant; and still further every stone, every mineral, down to every grain of dust, into its order. </p>

54. The nature and quality of the order in which the universe was created would require many pages to explain; but a slight sketch of it will be given in a subsequent section on Creation (<a href="75.htm">75</a>, et seq.). It must be borne in mind that all things in the universe, both in general and in particular, were created each in its own order, that they might subsist by themselves; and they were thus created from the beginning in order that they might conform to the universal order, to the end that, while particular orders should exist, they might yet constitute one whole. This may be illustrated by the following examples. Man was created in his own order, and also each part of him in its order, as the head, the body, the heart, the lungs, the liver, the pancreas, the stomach; every organ of motion or muscle in its order, and also every organ of sense, as the eye, the ear, the tongue. In fact, there is not the smallest artery and fibre in the body which has not been created in its own order; and yet these innumerable parts so conform to the common order and unite with it that they form one whole. The case is the same with the rest of created things, but a mere mention of them must suffice. Every beast of the earth, every bird of the air, every fish of the sea, every reptile, in fact every worm oven to the minutest insect, has each been created in its own order; likewise every tree, plant, shrub and herb, and also every stone and mineral even to the smallest grain of dust, each has been created in its own order. </p>

54. Qualis autem Ordo est, in quem Universum est creatum, non potest nisi quam per plures membranas exponi; quaedam schiagraphia ejus in sequente Lemmate de Creatione exhibebitur. Tenendum est, quod in Universo omnia et singula, ut per se subsistant, in suos ordines creata sint, et quod a principio ita, ut cum universi ordine se conjungant, propter causam ut singulares ordines subsistant in Universali, et sic unum faciant: sed ad quaedam Exempla; Homo in suum ordinem creatus est, et quoque unumquodvis ejus in suum, sicut Caput in suum, corpus ejus in suum, Cor, Pulmo, Hepar, Pancreas, Ventriculus in suos, omne organum motus quod vocatur Musculus in suum, et omne Organum sensus, ut oculus, auris, lingua, in suum, imo non datur arteriola et fibrilla ibi, quae non in suum, et tamen innumerabilia haec se conjungunt cum communi ejus, et se ei injungunt ita, ut simul unum faciant: simile est cum reliquis, quorum sola recensio ad illustrationem sufficit; omnis Bestia terrae, omnis Avis coeli, omnis Piscis maris, omne reptile, imo omnis vermis usque ad blattam, in suum ordinem creatum est; pariter omnis arbor, omne arbustum, virgultum, et legumen, in suum; et insuper omnis lapis, et omnis minera, usque ad unumquemvis pulverem <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
