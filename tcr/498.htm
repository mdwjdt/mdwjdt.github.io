<p>
498. The culmination of the points just presented is that free choice in spiritual matters dwells in a state of complete perfection in our soul. Just as water wells up from underground to form a spring, free choice flows from our soul into our mind, into both its chambers (the will and the intellect), and flows through them into our bodily senses and our speech and actions.
<p>There are three levels of life within us: the soul, the mind, and bodily sensation. Everything that exists on a higher level enjoys a greater perfection than the things that are on a lower level.
<p>The Lord is present with us through our human freedom, in that freedom, and with that freedom, constantly urging us to receive him but at the same time never removing or taking away our freedom, since, as I mentioned above [493-496], no spiritual action that we have taken stays with us unless we freely chose to take it. Therefore you could say that our freedom is where the Lord dwells with us in our soul.
</p>
<p>
[2] Nevertheless, in both worlds - the spiritual and the earthly - the doing of evil is forbidden by law, since otherwise society would no longer exist anywhere. This is clear without explanation, but I will still illustrate it by the fact that without those external restraints not only would society cease to exist, but in fact the entire human race would perish. There are two loves that human beings find particularly enticing: love of dominating everyone, and love of possessing everyone's wealth. These loves will rush on to infinity if the reins on them are let loose. The hereditary evil we are born with arises primarily from these two loves. Adam's only problem was a desire to become like God; we read that the serpent inspired that desire in him [<a href="3927/genesis_3_4.htm">Genesis 3:4-5</a>]. Therefore when he is cursed he is told that the land is going to yield him thorns and thistles (); these plants mean everything that is evil and consequently false. All people who are slaves to these loves view themselves alone as the only thing in which and for which all others exist. People like this have no compassion, no fear of God, no love for their neighbor. Therefore they have mercilessness, savagery, and cruelty, and a hellish longing and eagerness for stealing and robbing and for the deceitfulness and trickery involved. The animals of the earth have no innate desires of this kind; when they kill and devour, the only love driving them is their desire to fill their stomachs or to protect themselves. Therefore, because they have these types of love, evil people are more savage, more ferocious, and worse than any animal.
</p>
<p>
[3] The behavior of a rioting crowd, when the restraints of the law break down, reveals that human beings are inwardly this way. This aspect of human nature is also visible in massacres and raids, when the sound [of the trumpet] gives the soldiers permission to unleash rage against the conquered or captured. Hardly anyone declines such an opportunity before the beat of the drum calls it off. This makes clear that if no fear of legal punishment held us back, not only society but the human race as a whole would be destroyed.
<p>The only thing that removes all these traits is the proper exercise of our free choice in spiritual things, which is to focus our mind on the state of our life after death. </p>

498. The conclusion from this is that true freedom of will in spiritual matters resides in a person's soul in full perfection. From there it flows, like a gush of water into a spring, into both parts of his mind, the will and the understanding, and through these into the bodily senses, and into speech and action. Life in a person exists in three degrees: in the soul, the mind and the body with its senses. Everything in a higher degree excels in perfection what is in a lower degree. It is this freedom a person enjoys by means of which, in which and together with which the Lord makes His presence felt by a person, unceasingly pressing to be received. But He never deflects or does away with his freedom, since, as I said before, nothing which a person does without freedom in spiritual matters lasts. It can therefore be said that it is this freedom which permits the Lord to reside in a person's soul.</p>
<p>
[2] It is too obvious to require explanation, that wrongdoing is in both the spiritual and natural worlds curbed by laws, since no society anywhere could otherwise be stable. Yet illustrations are needed to show that without those external constraints not only would society come to an end, but the whole human race would perish too. Man is prey to two loves, that of dominating others and that of possessing everyone's wealth. These loves, if given free rein, race away without limit. The hereditary evils a person acquires by birth come chiefly from those two loves. Adam's crime was simply wishing to become like God, an evil ambition the serpent put into his mind, as we are told. So when he was cursed, he was told that the earth should bring forth thorns and thistles for him (<a href="3927/genesis_3_5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>, <a href="3927/genesis_3_18.htm">18</a>), meaning all evil and falsity derived from it. All held in thrall by those loves regard themselves alone as the one person in whom and for whom all others exist. They are without pity, fear of God, or love for the neighbour, so that they are unmerciful, savage and cruel, their greed and longing to rob and steal are worthy of hell, and they are cunning and deceitful in carrying out such crimes. Not even the animals of the earth have such innate wickedness, for the only desire which makes them kill and eat other animals is to fill their bellies and to protect themselves. A wicked man, therefore, looked at from the point of view of those loves is more savage, more fierce and worse than any animal.</p>
<p>
[3] It becomes clear in riotous crowds, where the restraints of the law are ineffective, that this is what people are like inwardly, as also in cases of massacre and looting, when the signal is given to wreak one's fury on the defeated or besieged; hardly anyone holds his hand until the drum is heard signalling it to cease. These examples show that if there were no fear of legal penalties to deter people, not only society but the whole human race would be destroyed. The only way to be rid of all these evils is to use one's free will in spiritual matters correctly, that is, to focus the mind on thoughts of the conditions of life after death. </p>

<p>
498. The conclusion from all this is that freedom of choice itself in spiritual things resides in the soul of man in all perfection, and from that it flows, like a stream into a fountain, into his mind, into the two parts of it, which are the will and the understanding, and through these into the bodily senses, and into speech and actions. For in man there are three degrees of life, the soul, the mind, and the sentient body; and all that is included in the higher degree is more perfect than that which is in a lower degree. It is this freedom of man, through which, in which, and with which, the Lord is present in him, and unceasingly urgent to be received; but He in no way sets aside or takes away this freedom, since, as said above, whatever man does in spiritual things, that is not done from freedom, does not endure. It may therefore be said that the Lord's abode in man is this freedom of man which is in his soul.
</p>
<p>
[2] It is evident without explanation that the doing of evil, in both the spiritual and the natural world, is restrained by laws, since otherwise society would everywhere cease to exist. Nevertheless, it must be made clear that without such external bonds, not only would society cease to exist, but the whole human race would perish. For man is enticed by two loves, the love of ruling over all, and the love of possessing the wealth of all. These loves, if uncurbed, rush onward to infinity. The hereditary evils into which man is born have arisen principally from these two loves; nor was the sin of Adam any other than a desire to become as God, which evil the serpent infused into him, as it is written; therefore in the curse pronounced upon him it is said: <p>That the earth should bring forth the thorn and the thistle to him (<a href="3927/genesis_3_5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>, <a href="3927/genesis_3_18.htm">18</a>); <p>which means all evil and falsity therefrom. All who are enslaved by these loves, look upon themselves as the one only object, in which and for which all others exist. Such have no pity, no fear of God, no love for the neighbor; consequently they are unmerciful, inhuman and cruel, and are possessed by an infernal lust and greed for robbing and plundering, and by craft and cunning in working out their purposes. Such evils are not innate in the beasts of the earth; these do not slaughter and devour each other, except from the love of satisfying their hunger or defending themselves. Therefore a wicked man, viewed with reference to these loves, is more inhuman, fiercer, and worse than any beast.
</p>
<p>
[3] That man is inwardly such, is manifest in seditious disturbances when the bonds of law are loosed, and also in massacres and pillaging, when the signal is given to soldiers that they are free to satiate their fury upon the conquered or besieged; from which scarcely anyone desists until the drum beats the order to do so. From all this it is clear that if no fear of legal penalties restrained men, not only society, but the whole human race, would be destroyed. But none of these evils can be removed except by the true use of freedom of choice in spiritual things, and this is done by directing the mind to reflection upon the state of life after death. </p>

498. It follows from these considerations that free will resides in a man's soul in the fullest perfection; and thence, as the spring water into the fountain, it flows into the two parts of his mind, the will and the understanding, and through these into the bodily senses, and into speech and action. For there are in every man three degrees of life, the soul, the mind and the sensual body; and whatever is in a higher degree is in a state of perfection above that which is in a lower degree. This freedom is the means by which, in which and with which the Lord is present in man, unceasingly urging to be received. Yet He never sets aside or takes away man's freedom; for, as said above, whatever is not done by man in spiritual things in the exercise of freedom does not remain with him; so that it may be said that this freedom is where in man's soul the Lord abides with him.</p>
<p>
[2] The commission of evil in both worlds, the spiritual and the natural, is restrained by laws, otherwise society would nowhere continue to subsist. This is so evident that it requires no explanation. However this further proposition will be illustrated, namely, that without external restraints not only would society cease to subsist, but also the whole human race would perish. Man is obsessed by two loves, the love of ruling over all, and the love of possessing the wealth of all. These two loves, if restraints upon them were relaxed, surge on without limit; and they are the chief source of the hereditary evils into which man is born. This was the sin of Adam, that he wished to become as God; which evil, we read, was infused into him by the serpent. Hence in the curse pronounced against him it is said,<p>That the earth should bring forth for him the thorn and the thistle. <a href="3927/genesis_3_5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>, <a href="3927/genesis_3_18.htm">18</a>;<p>and by these are meant all evil and its derived falsity. All who give themselves up to these loves have regard for themselves alone, in and for whose existence all others have their being. Such have no pity, no fear of God, no love of the neighbor and consequently are unmerciful, inhuman and cruel. They have an infernal covetous lust of plunder and robbery, and exercise craft and treachery in achieving their ends. The beasts of the earth have no such vices in their nature; their only desire in killing and devouring others is to satisfy their hunger and protect themselves from danger; so that an evil man dominated by these loves is more inhuman, savage and vile than any beast.</p>
<p>
[3] That such is the inner nature of man becomes evident in seditious tumults, when the restraints of law are thrown off; and also in the slaughter and pillage which ensue when the signal is given to the victors to vent their fury on besieged townspeople who have been vanquished; scarcely one stays his hand till the order to cease is heard. It is clear, therefore that if men were not restrained by fear of punishment inflicted by law, not only society but also the whole human race would be destroyed. The only way of removing these evils is by the true use of free will in spiritual things; and this involves applying the mind to the consideration of the life after death. </p>
