<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>381</b>. ⑶伪信根本就不是信。人若将大量心思花在自己身上、把自己置于他人之上，就会成为一个伪善者。因为他由此将心智的思维和情感指向并聚焦于他的身体，并将它们与身体感官联结起来。他就这样变成一个属世、感官和肉欲之人，然后他的心智无法从与之粘附的肉体中退出，被提升到神那里，也无法在天堂之光中看到神的任何事物，即属灵之物。由于他是肉欲之人，故所进入（即经由他的聆听进入其理解力）的属灵之物对他来说，似乎就象空中的幽灵或尘埃，或象奔跑流汗的马儿头上围绕的苍蝇。结果，他发自内心嘲笑它们。因为众所周知，属世人将属于灵性的事物，即属灵之物视为幻觉。<br />在属世人当中，伪善者是最低等的，因为他是感官的。其心智紧贴身体感官，因此除了感官所暗示的外，他不喜欢看到任何东西；由于感官处于自然界，所以它们会迫使心智以自然界的方式思考一切事物，包括属于信的一切。倘若这样的伪善者成为一名传教士，那他保留在记忆中的，是他在童年和青少年时期所听到的有关信的那类事物。但由于它们内在没有任何属灵之物，只有纯属世之物，所以当他将其呈现给听众时，它们无非是些毫无生命的话语，仅仅由于我欲和物欲的快乐而似乎有生命。这些快乐照着演讲者的口才使听众振作，几乎就象悦耳的歌声那样迷惑他们的耳朵。<br />这个虚伪的传教士讲完道回到家，就会嘲笑他在听众面前通过圣言所讲解的有关信的所有内容，说不定心里还会说：“我撒网在湖中，又逮到一些肥鱼和扇贝。”因为在这种人的想象里，他就是如此看待所有具有正信之人的。伪善者就象双头雕像，一个头在另一个头里面，里面的头与躯干或身体相连，而外面的头围着里面的头转，它还有一张涂抹了类似人脸颜色的面庞，确切地说，就象理发店里所展示的木头脑袋。伪善者还象一只小船，水手通过摆弄风帆或顺风或逆风将它随意转向；他摆弄风帆时使小船倾向于顺从肉体和感官乐趣的一切事物。<br />伪善的牧师就是完美的喜剧小丑、模仿者和演员，能扮演国王、公爵、大主教和主教等角色；不过，一脱掉戏装，他们就去妓院与妓女厮混。他们还像挂在铰链上的门，能来回转动；这就是其心智的样子，因为它既能朝地狱这一侧打开，也能朝天堂这一侧打开。朝这一侧打开时，就会朝另一侧关闭。令人称奇的是，当供职于神圣事物、通过圣言教导真理时，除了相信它们外，他们什么也不知道，因为这时，门朝地狱是关闭的；但一回到家，他们就什么都不信了，因为这时，门朝天堂是关闭的。<br />最坏的伪善者对真正属灵之人有着不可调和的敌意，如同撒旦对天堂天使的敌意。在世期间，他们并未察觉这一点，但等到死后脱去那能使他们伪装成属灵之人的外在，这敌意就会表现出来，因为他们的内在人就是这类撒旦。不过，我会解释天堂天使如何识别这些属灵的伪善者，就是那些“外面披着羊皮，里面却是残暴的狼”（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.15.htm">马太福音7:15</a>）之人。他们就象小丑一样用手掌行走，并且祷告，发自内心向魔鬼呼喊，拥抱他们，却在空中拍打着自己的鞋子，从而向神制造噪音。但当站起来时，他们的眼睛看起来像豹子，步态像狼，嘴巴像狐狸，牙齿像鳄鱼；至于他们的信，则像秃鹫。</p>

381. (3)偽善之信根本就不是信。
<p>當人極其關注自己,將自己置於他人之上, 他就成為一名偽善者。因為如此, 他將頭腦的想法與意志對準並聚焦於他的肉體, 與肉體的感官相連。結果, 他變成屬世的,肉欲的與物質之人。以致於他的思想無法從所依戀的肉體被移開, 也就無法向上帝提升, 也不能明白天國之中的任何關於上帝的事情, 也就是一切屬靈之事。因為他是個肉欲之人, 進入到此人思想的屬靈概念, 從耳聽進入認知, 對他來說看起來就如同空氣中的幽靈或微塵, 或者像駿馬奔跑時, 在流汗的馬頭周圍的蒼蠅, 它們什麼也不是。最終他在內心裡嘲笑它們, 因為眾所周知, 屬世之人對關於靈或屬靈的事情視之為幻覺。
<p>[2]在屬世人之中, 偽善者是最低等的, 因為他是肉欲之人。他的思想緊緊與他的肉體感官相粘, 以致於除了肉體感官所推崇的, 他不喜歡明白任何事情; 因為這些感官屬於塵世的範疇, 迫使他的思想只能在塵世的範疇內思考一切主題, 關於信的一切事務也難以擺脫。
<p>倘若偽善者成為一名講道者, 他的記憶中仍存留著孩童,少年與青年時聽到的關於信的教導。因為他講道的內容毫無屬靈成份, 盡是屬世之物, 當他在聚會人群講道時, 他的話語之中毫無生命可言。不過, 聽起來似乎話中有生命, 因為講道者為了滿足於愛自己與愛世界, 促使他滿懷激情地演說以迷住聽眾的耳朵, 如同唱歌的旋律。
<p>[3]當這位偽善的講道者在聚會後回到家中, 對當天所講之道以及由聖言引用的內容暗自發笑。或許會自言自語:"我撒網在湖中, 又逮到一些肥魚和扇貝啦。"這類的偽善者就是如此描述那些有真信仰之人的。
<p>偽善者就像一尊雙頭的雕像, 一個頭在另一個頭之中; 裡面的頭與軀幹或身體相連, 外面的頭緊繞著裡面的頭, 臉部上色如同人臉, 有點像假髮店櫥窗裡的木頭腦袋。偽善者還像水手操舵, 使帆順風或逆風, 讓船順著自己肉體感官而行。
<p>[4]身為牧師的偽善者們是技巧熟練的喜劇小丑,模仿者與演員, 能扮演君王,教會領袖,主教等角色; 不過, 一脫掉戲裝後, 就去妓院與妓女一同消磨時光。
<p>他們還像裝在鉸鏈上的門, 能來回轉動這門; 他們的思想便是如此, 能向地獄或天國兩邊敞開。當敞向一邊時, 便向另一邊關閉。
<p>令人驚奇的是, 當他們從事於聖職事務和教導聖言真理時, 他們的確未意識到他們並不相信這些, 因為門在此時向著地獄是關上的。然而一會之後, 一回到家中, 他們就什麼都不信了, 因為門在此時向著天國關閉了。
<p>[5]偽善者中情節嚴重的, 對真正屬靈者懷有不可和解的敵意, 如同撒旦對天國天人的敵意。活在人間時, 偽善者自己察覺不到如此的恨意。但在死後, 人脫離了外在的肉體(這個外在部分能假扮成屬靈的樣子), 這樣的恨意就顯露出來, 因為他們的內在人就是這類撒旦。
<p>我想說說天國中的天人怎麼看這些屬靈的偽善者, 就是那些外面披著羊皮, 裡面卻是殘暴的狼, 四處遊蕩(<a href="3927/matthew_7_15.htm">馬太福音7:15</a>)。禱告時, 心裡向魔鬼呼求並擁抱魔鬼, 外表卻向上帝製造明顯的聲音。當他們站在地上時, 眼如獵豹,行路如狼,說話如狐狸,牙齒如鱷魚, 至於信, 看起來如同禿鷹。 </p>

381. (c) Hypocritical faith is no faith at all. We become hypocrites when we think about ourselves a great deal and give precedence to ourselves rather than others. By doing this we focus the thoughts and feelings of our mind on our body and invest them there; we unite our thoughts and feelings to our physical senses. This turns us into earthly, sense-oriented, and physical people. In this state, our mind cannot be disconnected from the flesh it is attached to; it cannot be lifted to God or see anything related to God in the light of heaven; it cannot see anything spiritual. Because we are then people of the flesh, any spiritual things that come through our hearing into our intellect seem to us like no more than ghosts or dust particles in the air; in fact, they seem like flies around the head of a running, sweating horse, so we mock them in our heart. It is common knowledge that the earthly self regards the things of the spirit or spiritual things as crazy.
</p>
<p>
[2] Of all earthly people, hypocrites are the lowest and most earthly. They are sense-oriented - their mind is tightly bound to their physical senses. They have no love for seeing anything except what their senses take in; and because the senses are in the material world, the senses force the mind to think about everything, including all aspects of faith, from the point of view of the material world.
<p>If these hypocrites become preachers, they retain in their memory the types of things they heard said about faith when they were children, teenagers, and young adults. Yet since their words contain nothing spiritual, and all that their words do contain is merely earthly, when they speak before an assembled congregation, the words have no life in them at all. The words sound as if they have life in them, because hypocrites enjoy loving themselves and the world, a pleasure that leads them to hold forth eloquently and caress the ears of their listeners with sounds that are much like the melodies of a song.
</p>
<p>
[3] When hypocritical preachers go home after church, they laugh at all the things they have just said to the congregation about faith, and at the passages they have quoted from the Word. They might say to themselves, "I threw my net into the lake and caught some flatfish and shellfish," since that is how they picture anyone who has true faith.
<p>Hypocrites are like a carved human figure with two heads, one inside the other. The inner head is attached to the figure's torso and body. The outer head is able to spin all the way around the inner head. The front of the outer head is painted with flesh colors to look like a human face, somewhat like the wooden heads that are set in the shop windows of wig-makers.
<p>Hypocrites are like a ship that sailors can steer either with the wind or against it by adjusting the sail. Hypocrites give their approval to any who indulge them with what their flesh and their senses enjoy. That is how they set their sails.
</p>
<p>
[4] Ministers who are hypocrites are skilled comedians, impressionists, and actors who can impersonate royalty, military leaders, church leaders, and bishops; but shortly after they take off their costumes they go back to the whorehouse and live with the whores.
<p>They are also like doors hanging on a revolving hinge that can be turned in two directions. Their mind is like this type of door: it can be opened in the direction of hell or in the direction of heaven. When it is opened in one direction it is closed in the other.
<p>It is astounding that when they are administering holy rituals and teaching truths from the Word, they actually do not realize that they do not believe those things. At that time they close their door toward hell. As soon as they go home, however, they do not believe a shred of it, because they then close their door toward heaven.
</p>
<p>
[5] The most completely hypocritical people have a deep-seated hatred of truly spiritual people - the same kind of hatred as satans have against the angels of heaven. The hypocritical people themselves do not feel this hatred while they are alive in the world. It surfaces after death when they lose the outer self in which they pretended to be spiritual. It is their inner self that is this kind of satan.
<p>I should say what spiritual hypocrites look like to the angels of heaven - the kind of spiritual hypocrites who walk around in sheep's clothing but are inwardly as predatory as wolves (<a href="3927/matthew_7_15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>). In prayer, they look like acrobats walking on their hands. Their mouths call out from their hearts to demons and kiss them, but the sound they send toward God is that of their feet clapping in the air. When they stand on their feet, however, they have the eyes of a leopard, the gait of a wolf, the face of a fox, the teeth of a crocodile, and the faith of a vulture. </p>

381. (iii) Hypocritical faith is no faith at all.<p>A person becomes a hypocrite when he thinks a great deal about himself and sets himself above others. For by so doing he directs and concentrates the thoughts and affections of his mind into his body, linking them to his bodily senses. As a result he becomes natural, sensual and corporeal, so that his mind cannot be removed from the flesh to which it clings and be raised to God, nor can it see anything of God's in the light of heaven, that is, anything spiritual. Because he is a fleshly person, the spiritual ideas that enter his mind, passing by hearing into the understanding, seem to him nothing but ghosts or motes in the air, or rather like flies around the head of a horse sweating as it runs. Consequently in his heart he laughs at them; for it is well known that the natural man regards the things of the spirit, anything, that is, spiritual, as hallucinations.</p>
<p>
[2] The hypocrite is the lowest among natural men, since he is sensual; for his mind is tightly tied to his bodily senses, so that he does not like seeing anything but what his senses suggest. Since the senses are in the realm of nature, they compel the mind to think on every subject in natural terms, and this is true also of all matters concerned with faith. If that hypocrite becomes a preacher, he retains in his memory the sort of things that were said about faith when he was a boy or youth. But since they contain inwardly nothing that is spiritual, but only what is wholly natural, when he utters them before an audience, they are nothing but lifeless sounds. The reason they sound as if alive is that this comes from the pleasures of self-love and love of the world. These cause them to ring eloquently and charm the ears, very much as does harmonious singing.</p>
<p>
[3] The hypocritical preacher on returning home after his sermon laughs at all he said and expounded from the Word to his audience on the subject of faith; and he may perhaps say to himself: 'I cast a net into the lake, and caught flat-fish and shell-fish.' For this is how all those who have true faith look to such people in their delusion. A hypocrite is like a carved image with a double head, one inside the other; the inner head is attached to the trunk or body, the outer one, which can swivel around the inner one, has its face painted with colours resembling the human face, rather like the wooden heads to be seen in the shop-windows of wig-makers. The hypocrite is like a boat which a sailor by trimming the sail can make go at will with the wind or against it. Such is his sailing that the boat is prone to everything which favours the pleasures of the flesh and the senses,</p>
<p>
[4] Ministers who are hypocrites are consummate comedians, mimics and actors, who can play the parts of kings, dukes, primates and bishops; and a little later, when they have taken off their costumes, they go to brothels and spend their time with whores. They are also like doors hung on swivelling hinges, so that they can swing to and fro; that is what their mind is like, since it can be opened on the side of hell or on that of heaven. When it is open in one direction, it is closed in the other. For the extraordinary thing is that while they are engaged in their sacred duties and are teaching truths from the Word, they are quite unaware of anything but believing them; for at these times the door is closed to hell. But a little later, on returning home, they believe nothing, because then the door is closed to heaven.</p>
<p>
[5] The worst hypocrites have an implacable enmity for truly spiritual people, resembling that satans have for the angels of heaven. They do not feel that this is so, as long as they live in the world, but it shows up after death, when their external, which allowed them to make a pretence of being spiritual people, is taken away, since it is their internal man which is this sort of Satan. But I will explain how the angels of heaven see these spiritual hypocrites, who are those who go around in sheeps' clothing while inwardly they are ravening wolves (<a href="3927/matthew_7_15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>). They look like clowns walking on the palms of their hands and praying; they cry from the heart with their mouth to demons and embrace them; but they clap their shoes in the air, and thus make a noise to God. But when they stand on their feet, their eyes have the look of leopards, their gait looks like that of wolves, their mouth like foxes', their teeth like crocodiles'; and as regards faith they look like vultures. </p>

381. (3) Hypocritical faith is no faith. Man becomes a hypocrite when he thinks much about himself and places himself before others, for thereby he directs his mind's thoughts and affections to his body, immerses them in it, and unites them with its senses. He thus becomes a natural, sensual, and corporeal man, and then his mind cannot be withdrawn from the flesh to which it adheres, and be raised to God, and cannot see anything of God in the light of heaven, that is, anything spiritual. And because he is a carnal man, the spiritual things that enter (that is, through his hearing into his understanding), seem to him only like something spectral, or like down floating in the air, or like flies about the head of a running and sweating horse; therefore in heart he ridicules them. For it is well known that the natural man looks upon what pertains to the spirit, that is, spiritual things, as hallucinations.
</p>
<p>
[2] Among natural men the hypocrite is the lowest natural for he is sensual, since his mind is closely bound to his bodily senses, and therefore he has no love for seeing anything but what his senses suggest; and as the senses are in nature, they compel the mind to think from nature about everything, and so in that way about everything pertaining to faith. If this hypocrite becomes a preacher, he retains in his memory such things as he had heard about faith during his childhood and youth; but as there is nothing spiritual inwardly in these things but only what is natural, when he presents them to a congregation they are nothing but lifeless words. They sound as if they had life because of the delight of the love of self and the world which makes them ring according to the eloquence of the speaker, and soothe the ear almost like the harmony of a song.
</p>
<p>
[3] When a hypocritical preacher returns home after his sermon, he laughs at everything that he has set forth before his congregation about faith or from the Word, and perhaps says to himself, "I have cast my net into the lake and have caught flat-fish and shell-fish," for such do all who are in true faith appear to his fancy. A hypocrite is like a sculptured image with a double head, one head within the other, the internal head connected with the trunk or body, while the external, which rotates about the internal, is painted on its front side in proper colors like a human face, much like the wooden heads displayed at the shops of hairdressers. He is also like a boat, which the sailor, by proper management of the sail, can direct as he pleases, either with the wind or against it; his trimming his sail is his favoring everyone who contributes to his indulgence in the delights of the flesh and its senses.
</p>
<p>
[4] Hypocritical ministers are finished comedians, mimics, and players, who can personate kings, leaders, primates, and bishops, and as soon as they have doffed their theatrical robes, visit brothels and consort with harlots. They are also like a door hung upon a round hinge that can open either way; their mind is such because it can be opened either hellward or heavenward, and when opened to one it is closed to the other; for, what is wonderful, when they are ministering in holy things and teaching truths from the Word, they do not know otherwise than that they believe in them, for the door is then closed toward hell; but the moment they return home they believe nothing, for the door is then closed toward heaven.
</p>
<p>
[5] Among consummate hypocrites there is an interior enmity against truly spiritual men, for it is like that of satans against the angels of heaven. They are unconscious of this while they are living in the world, but it manifests itself after death, when their external, by means of which they assumed the appearance of spiritual men, is taken away, for it is their internal man that is thus satanic. But I will tell how spiritual hypocrites, who are such as walk <p>In sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves (<a href="3927/matthew_7_15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>), <p>appear to the angels of heaven. They appear like soothsayers walking on the palms of their hands and praying, while from the heart they are crying with their lips to demons and kissing them, but by clapping their shoes together in the air they make a noise to God. But when they stand on their feet their eyes look like leopards' eyes, they step like wolves, their mouths are fox-like, their teeth like those of a crocodile, and as to faith they are like vultures. </p>

381. (3) Hypocritical faith is not faith. A man becomes a hypocrite when he thinks much about himself, and sets himself above others; for in this way he prescribes the thoughts and affections of his mind, and, directing them upon his body, he confines them to his bodily senses. He thus becomes natural, sensual and corporeal; and then his mind cannot be withdrawn from the flesh to which it clings, it cannot be elevated to God, nor can it see anything relating to God in the light of heaven, that is, anything spiritual. As he is only carnal, the spiritual things which enter his mind, that is, which he hears and receives into his understanding, appear to him to be merely visionary, or as motes in the air, or like flies around the head of a running and sweating horse; and therefore in his heart he despises them, for it is well known that the natural man regards the things of the spirit, or spiritual matters, as delusions.</p>
<p>
[2] A hypocrite is the lowest among natural men, because he is sensual. For his mind is closely bound to the bodily senses, and consequently he does not desire to see anything but what his senses suggest; and these, being in the sphere of nature, compel his mind to think from nature on every subject, and thus on all matters of faith. If such a hypocrite becomes a preacher, he retains in his memory the things he learnt about faith in his childhood and youth; but because within these there is nothing spiritual, but only what is natural, his public utterances are nothing but empty verbiage. They may sound as if they were infused with life; but this arises from the delights of self-love and the love of the world which inspire them with eloquence, and charm, as with sweet music, the ears of his hearers.</p>
<p>
[3] When a preacher of this sort returns home after the sermon, he has a laugh at what he preached to his congregation about faith, and what he adduced from the Word, possibly saying to himself, "I have cast a net into the lake, and have caught flat-fish and shell-fish;" for such to his deluded mind appear all who hold a true faith.<p>A hypocrite is like a carved figure with two heads, one within the other. The inner of these is joined to the trunk or body, but the outer is movable about the inner, with a face painted in front, not unlike the wooden heads displayed in a barber's shop. He also resembles a boat which a sailor, by skillful management of the sail, can direct at pleasure either with the wind or against it, his craving to indulge the flesh and its senses answering to the trimming of the sail.</p>
<p>
[4] Hypocritical ministers are perfect comedians, mimics and actors, who can play the part of kings, dukes, primates and bishops; but as soon as they put off their theatrical costumes, they visit houses of ill-fame and associate with courtesans. They are also like doors on hinges that allow them to open inwards and outwards; as the state of their minds is such that they can be opened towards hell and towards heaven, and when they are opened towards the one, they are closed towards the other. It is a remarkable circumstance that when they are engaged in their holy office and teaching truths from the Word, they imagine that they believe them, because the door towards hell is then closed; but as soon as they return home they believe not a whit, because then the door towards heaven is closed.</p>
<p>
[5] Consummate hypocrites harbor a deep-rooted hatred toward spiritual men, such as satans have toward the angels of heaven. They are not sensible of this while living in this world; but it manifests itself after death on the removal of their external, by which they assumed the appearance of the spiritual man, for their internal man is satanic. I will now tell how, to the angels of heaven, appear those spiritual hypocrites who "come in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves" <a href="3927/matthew_7_15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>.<p>They appear like religious fanatics, walking on their hands, while they utter prayers and call aloud from the heart to devils and adore them; but they clap their shoes in the air and with this sound worship God. When, however, they resume the upright posture they have eyes like a leopard, a prowling gait like a wolf, jaws like a fox and teeth like a crocodile; and in faith they are as vultures. </p>

Sed dicam, qualiter spirituales hypocritae, qui sunt qui in indumentis ovium incedunt, et intrinsecus sunt lupi rapaces, <a href="3927/matthew_7_15.htm">Matthaeus 7:15</a>, apparent coram Angelis Coeli; apparent sicut harioli ambulantes super palmis manuum, orantes, qui ore ex corde clamant ad daemones, et osculantur illos, sed complodunt calceos in aere, et sic sonant ad Deum; at cum stant super pedibus, apparent quoad oculos sicut pardi, quoad gressus sicut lupi, quoad os sicut vulpes, quoad dentes sicut crocodili, et quoad fidem sicut vultures.<p>
