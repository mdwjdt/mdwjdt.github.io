842. 有时, 犹太人会看见一个手拿权杖的天人在半空中, 给他们的感觉就是摩西。 他奉劝他们不要再徒然等候弥赛亚的降临了, 因为基督就是弥赛亚, 祂统治他们并所有人。 他还说, 他了解这一切, 在世时也知道祂。 听到这番话后, 他们离开了。 大部分人过后就忘了, 只有少数人记住了, 这些人就被送到由转化的犹太人组成的犹太教堂, 在那里接受教导。 他们被教导后, 就被赐予新衣, 以换下原先的破衣, 还被赐予新写就的圣言复本, 以及城中一套不怎么漂亮的居所。 但那些不接受的人则被丢了下去, 其中很多人进入森林和沙漠, 在那里相互劫掠。 </p>

</h4>
<p>
842. From time to time Jews see an angel in midair above them carrying a rod in his hand. He leads them to believe that he is Moses. He urges them to give up waiting for the Messiah (which is an insane thing to do even there), since the true Messiah is Christ, who rules over them and all others. This Moses tells them that he himself knows Christ is the Messiah, and says he had even known about Christ when Christ was in the world.
<p>After hearing this, people leave. Most of them forget this information, but a few of them hold on to it. Those who do take this to heart are sent to synagogues of converted Jews, where they receive further instruction. When they have been taught, they are given new clothes to replace their old rags, a neatly written copy of the Word, and a new home in a decent city.
<p>The unreceptive are cast down. Many end up in forests or deserts and steal from each other. </p>

842. There is sometimes seen by the Jews an angel at a moderate height above them with a rod in his hand, who gives them to believe that he is Moses. He begs them to abandon the folly of waiting for the Messiah even there, since the Messiah is Christ, their ruler and everyone's. He says that he knows this and knew it when he was in the world. On hearing this they depart; the majority forget it, and only a few remember. Those who do remember are sent to synagogues run by converted Jews, where they are instructed. When their instruction is over, they are given new clothes to replace their rags, and a neatly written copy of the Word; they are allotted a home in a not unlovely city. But those who do not receive the teaching are cast down, many of them into forests and deserts, where they prey on one another. </p>

842. Sometimes an angel with a staff in his hand is seen by the Jews, above, at a middle altitude, who gives them to believe that he is Moses. He exhorts them to refrain from their senseless expectation even there of a Messiah, since Christ is the Messiah, who rules them and all men; telling them that he knows this and also knew of Him when he was in the world. When they have heard this they go away. The greater part of them forget it, but a few remember it, and these are sent to synagogues composed of converted Jews, and are instructed; and when they have been instructed, new clothes in place of their tattered ones are given them, also a copy of the Word neatly written, and a not unhandsome dwelling in the city. But those who do not receive are cast down, many of them into forests and deserts, where they practice robbery among each other. </p>

842. There sometimes appears to the Jews, at a medium altitude above them, an angel with a rod in his hand, who gives them to understand that he is Moses. He exhorts them to desist from the folly of expecting the Messiah even there, because the Messiah is Christ, who rules over them and all men. He says that he knows this to be true, and that while in the world he knew this concerning Him. When they hear this they go away, the greater part forgetting what they have heard, and but few retaining it. Those who pay heed to the warning are sent to synagogues formed of converted Jews, where they receive instruction. There, in place of their tattered garments, they are given new ones; and a copy of the Word, neatly written, is given to them, and they are allotted a decent dwelling in the city. Those, however, who do not receive the instruction are cast down, and many are sent away to woods and deserts, where they rob one another. </p>

842. Apparet Judaeis aliquoties Angelus supra in media altitudine cum Baculo in manu, et dat credere quod sit MOSES, ac hortatur ut desistant a vesania de exspectatione Messiae etiam ibi, quia Messias est Christus, qui illos et omnes regit, et quod ille id sciat, et quoque de Ipso sciverit, dum in Mundo fuit: quibus auditis recedunt, et maxima pars obliviscuntur, et pauci retinent. Qui retinent, illi mittuntur in Synagogas, quae sunt ex Conversis, ac instruuntur, et illis, dum instructi sunt, dantur novae Vestes pro laceris, et datur Verbum nitide scriptum, tum Habitatio in Urbe non indecora: illi autem qui non recipiunt, dejiciuntur, ac multi in Sylvas et Deserta, ubi agunt inter se latrocinia. </p>
