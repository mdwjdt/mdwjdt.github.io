<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第235节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>235</b>.大量经历向我清楚显明，属灵天使拥有圣言的属灵之义，属天天使拥有圣言的属天之义。我被允许发觉，当我照字义阅读圣言时，与天堂的联系就建立起来了，时而与那里的这个社群相联，时而又与那个社群相联。我照属世之义所理解的话，属灵天使以属灵之义来理解，属天天使则以属天之义来理解，这也是在一瞬间。我已数千次觉察到这种联系，故对此毫无疑问。此外，天堂之下也有灵人滥用这种联系，他们从圣言字义中重复某些章节，并立时发觉、记下建立联系的社群。我也曾多次看见并听说这种事。这些直接经历使我得知，字义上的圣言是与主结合并与天堂天使联结的一种神性媒介。</p>

235. 很多的親身經歷讓我明明地看出, 屬靈天人掌握聖言的屬靈意義, 屬天天人掌握屬天意義。我曾被允許來感知其中奧秘, 當我以文字意義來讀聖言時, 會與天國建立聯繫, 一時與天國的此社區, 一時與彼社區。我以屬世(文字)意義來理解的經文, 被屬靈天人以屬靈意義來理解, 被屬天天人以屬天意義來理解, 這些是瞬間同時發生。我已數千次地感知這樣的聯繫, 對此不會有任何疑問。也有天國之下的靈濫用這種聯繫, 他們從聖言的文字中複述一些經句, 並立即察覺注意到底與哪個社區建立了聯繫。我也曾多次看見和聽見這些事情。這些直觀的經歷讓我清楚, 在文字意義中的聖言是與主連接以及與天國之天人聯合的途徑與方法。 </p>

235. A number of experiences have made it obvious to me that spiritual angels are associated with the Word's spiritual meaning and heavenly angels are associated with the Word's heavenly meaning. I was allowed to perceive that a line of communication to the heavens opened up while I was reading the Word in its literal meaning - at one moment to one community, at another moment to another community. The things that I understood in the earthly meaning the spiritual angels understood in the spiritual meaning and the heavenly angels understood in the heavenly meaning. It was instantaneous. Having perceived this communication several thousand times, I have no room left for doubt about it.
<p>In fact, there are spirits below the heavens who abuse this communication. They recite some saying from the Word's literal meaning and immediately observe and record the community that it communicates with. This too I have often seen and heard.
<p>I have been allowed to know through living experience, then, that the Word in its literal meaning is a divine medium for connecting us to the Lord and associating us with angels in heaven. </p>

235. It has been made evident to me by long experience that the spiritual angels possess the spiritual sense of the Word, and the celestial angels its celestial sense. I have been allowed to perceive that, when I read the Word in its literal sense, communication was established with the heavens, at one time with one community there, at another time with another. The words which I understood in their natural sense were understood by the spiritual angels in their spiritual sense, and by the celestial angels in their celestial sense, and this too upon the instant. Since I have perceived this communication some thousands of times, I have no doubt left concerning it. There are also spirits below the heavens who misuse this communication; for they repeat some verses from the literal sense of the Word, and immediately notice and mark down the community with which communication is established. This too I have seen and heard many times. These direct experiences have enabled me to know that the Word in its literal sense is a Divine means of being linked with the Lord and associated with the angels in heaven. </p>

235. That the spiritual angels are in the spiritual sense of the Word, and the celestial angels in its celestial sense, has been made evident to me by much experience. It has been granted to me to perceive that when I read the Word in the sense of its letter a sharing with the heavens was effected, now with this society there and now with that; and the things that I understood according to the natural sense the spiritual angels understood according to the spiritual sense, and the celestial angels according to the celestial sense, and this instantly. Having perceived this sharing some thousands of times, I have not the least doubt about it remaining. Moreover, there are spirits who are below the heavens, who abuse this sharing by reciting certain passages from the sense of the letter of the Word, and immediately observing and noting the society with which the sharing is effected. This, too, I have often seen and heard. In this way it has been given me to know by a living experience, that the Word in the sense of its letter is the Divine medium of conjunction with the Lord and affiliation with the angels of heaven. </p>

235. It has been proved to me by much experience that the spiritual angels are in the spiritual sense of the Word, and the celestial angels in its celestial sense. It has been granted me to perceive that, while I was reading the Word in the sense of the Letter, communication was opened with the heavens, sometimes with one society, sometimes with another. What I understood according to the natural sense, spiritual angels understood according to the spiritual sense, and this instantly. As I have perceived this communication thousands of times, I have not any doubt left concerning it. Moreover, some spirits, dwelling under the heavens, abuse this communication. They repeat some passages from the sense of the Letter of the Word, forthwith observing and making a note of the society with which communication is effected. I have frequently seen and heard this being done. Thus by actual experience it has been granted me to know that the Word, as to the sense of its Letter, is the Divine medium of conjunction with the Lord, and of association with the angels of heaven. </p>

235. Quod Angeli spirituales in Sensu spirituali Verbi sint, ac Angeli coelestes in Sensu coelesti ejus, manifestatum est mihi per multam experientiam: datum est percipere, quod cum legi Verbum in Sensu literae ejus, communicatio facta sit cum Coelis, nunc cum hac Societate ibi, nunc cum illa; quae ego secundum Sensum naturalem intellexi, Angeli spirituales secundum Sensum spiritualem, et Angeli coelestes secundum Sensum coelestem, intellexerunt; et hoc in instanti; quia haec communicatio, per aliquot millenas vices percepta est, de illa non relicta est mihi ulla dubitatio. Sunt etiam Spiritus, qui infra Coelos sunt, et hac communicatione abutuntur, recitant enim aliquot dicta ex Sensu literae Verbi, et illico animadvertunt et notant Societatem, cum qua communicatio fit; hoc etiam saepe vidi et audivi. Ex his per vivam experientiam datum est scire, quod Verbum quoad sensum literae ejus, sit Divinum medium conjunctionis cum Domino, et consociationis cum Angelis coeli. </p>
