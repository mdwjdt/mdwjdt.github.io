676. 过去很多以色列人, 以及现在的很多犹太人, 都以为他们是被特别拣选的, 因为他们受了割礼。 很多基督徒也有同样的想法, 因为他们受了洗。 然而, 这两项仪式, 无论割礼还是洗礼, 都仅仅是其接受者要从恶中洁净, 从而成为选民的一个标志和纪念。 没有内在的外在人不就象一座没有敬拜的圣殿, 除非作个马厩, 否则一无是处吗? 又或者, 没有内在的外在不就象长满芦苇和灯心草, 没有一粒谷物的田地, 或象只有枝和叶却没有葡萄的葡萄园, 或被主诅咒的不结果的无花果树 (<a href="3927/matthew_21_19.htm">马太福音21:19</a>), 或有灯无油的愚蠢童女吗 (<a href="3927/matthew_25_3.htm">马太福音25:3</a>) ? 更确切地说, 它不就象生活在坟墓里, 脚下是死尸, 墙周围是骨头, 午夜还有幽灵在房檐下飞舞? 或象豹子所驾的马车, 以狼当车夫, 傻子作乘客? 外在人并不是一个人, 仅仅是人的轮廓, 通过神成为智慧的内在人才构成人。 除非人对自己的心行割礼或施洗, 否则受割礼和受洗之人的情形也是一样。 </p>

676. There were many people among the children of Israel in the past, and there are many among Jews today, who believe they more than all others are the chosen people because they are circumcised. Likewise, there are many among Christians who believe they are the chosen people because they have been baptized. Yet both of these rituals, circumcision and baptism, were intended only as a sign and a reminder to be purified from evils. This purification is what truly makes people "chosen. "
<p>An outward change without an inward change is like a church building with no worship inside; it is useless to everyone, except perhaps as a stable for animals.
<p>An outward change without an inward change is like a field full of stalks and canes that have no grain. It is like a vine that has branches and leaves but no grapes. It is like the fig tree without fruit that the Lord cursed (<a href="3927/matthew_21_19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>). It is like the lamps in the hands of the foolish young women who had no oil (<a href="3927/matthew_25_3.htm">Matthew 25:3</a>). In fact, it is like living in a mausoleum with corpses under our feet, bones on the walls, and ghosts that fly near the ceiling at night. It is like a carriage drawn by leopards, with a wolf on top as the driver and an idiot sitting inside.
<p>Our outer self is not human. It only looks human. (Our inner self, which is our capacity for wisdom from God, is what makes us human.) This, then, is also the nature of people who have been circumcised or baptized but have not circumcised or washed their heart. </p>

676. There were many among the Children of Israel, and there are many among the Jews at the present time, who believe that they are specially chosen, because they are circumcised. There are also many Christians who think the same because they are baptised. Yet both these rites, circumcision and baptism, were only given as a sign and memorial that they should be purified from evils, and so become the chosen people. What in the case of a person is the external without the internal, except like a church building without services, a useless structure unless it can serve as a stable? Or again, what is the external without the internal but like a field of nothing but reeds and stalks without a crop of grain? Or like a vineyard with nothing but branches and leaves without any grapes? Or like a fig tree with no fruit, such as the Lord cursed (<a href="3927/matthew_21_19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>)? Or like lamps in the hands of the foolish virgins with no oil (<a href="3927/matthew_25_3.htm">Matthew 25:3</a>)? Or rather like living in a mausoleum, where there are corpses underfoot, bones around the walls and midnight apparitions flying beneath the roof? Or like a chariot pulled by leopards, with a wolf in it as charioteer, and a fool as passenger? The external man is not a man, but only the figure of a man; for it is the internal, the power to be wise which comes from God, which makes the man. It is much the same with the circumcised and the baptised, unless each circumcises or washes his heart. </p>

676. There were many among the sons of Israel who believed that they were elected in preference to all others, because of their having been circumcised, and many among the Jews at this day who so believe, and many among Christians have the same belief because of their having been baptized; and yet both circumcision and baptism were given solely as a sign and memorial that the recipients thereof were to be purified from evils, and thus become elect. What is an external in man without an internal but like a temple without worship, which is of no use except perhaps as a stable? And, further, what is an external without an internal but like a field full of reeds and rushes without grain, or like a vineyard consisting merely of vines and leaves without grapes, or like the fig-tree without fruit, which the Lord cursed (<a href="3927/matthew_21_19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>), or like the lamps without oil in the hands of the foolish virgins (<a href="3927/matthew_25_3.htm">Matthew 25:3</a>)? Or even what is it but like a dwelling-place in a tomb, where there are dead bodies under foot, bones around the walls, and specters of the night flitting beneath the roof, or like a carriage drawn by leopards, with a wolf for a driver and a fool for its occupant? For the external man is not a man, but only the figure of a man; the internal, which is to be wise from God, is what constitutes man. So is it with one circumcised and baptized, unless he circumcises or washes his head. </p>

</h4>
<p>
676. There were many among the Children of Israel who believed that they were chosen before all others, and many among the Jews to-day believe it in regard to themselves, because they were circumcised; and many Christians entertain the same belief because they have been baptized; but both circumcision and Baptism were instituted only as a sign and memorial that they should be purified from evils, and so become elect. With man an external without an internal is like a temple without worship, a building that may be used by any one as a stable. An external without an internal is like a field producing only rushes and reeds but no corn; or like a vine with branches and leaves, but no grapes; or like the fig-tree without the fruit, which the Lord cursed, <a href="3927/matthew_21_19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>; or like the lamps without oil in the hands of the foolish virgins, <a href="3927/matthew_25_3.htm">Matthew 25:3</a>. It is, in fact, like a dwelling inside a mausoleum, where dead bodies lie underfoot, with bones around the walls, while nocturnal spectres fly about beneath the roof; or like a carriage drawn by leopards with a wolf as driver, and an idiot riding in it. For the external man is not the man, but only the form of a man; it is the internal, that which is wise from God, which constitutes the man. So it is with those who are circumcised and with those who are baptized, unless they circumcise or wash their heart. </p>

676. Fuerunt plures apud filios Israelis, et hodie sunt apud Judaeos, qui credunt, quod prae omnibus electi sint, quia circumcisi, et inter Christianos, quia baptizati sunt; cum tamen ambae, Circumcisio et Baptizatio, sunt modo datae in Signum et in Memoriale, ut purificentur a malis, et sic fiant electi: quid Externum absque Interno apud hominem, nisi sicut Templum absque Cultu, quod non alicui usui est, nisi inserviat pro stabulo: et porro, quid Externum absque Interno, nisi sicut Ager ex meris cannis et calamis absque segete; nisi sicut Vinea ex meris palmitibus et foliis absque uvis: nisi sicut ficus absque suo fructu, cui Dominus maledixit, <a href="3927/matthew_21_19.htm">Matthaeus 21:19</a>; <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
nisi sicut lampades in manibus virginum stultarum absque oleo, <a href="3927/matthew_25_3.htm">Matthaeus 25:3</a>; <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
imo, nisi sicut habitatio in Mausolaeo, ubi cadavera sub pedibus, ossa circum parietes, et nocturnae larvae volantes sub tecto: aut sicut currus tractus a pardis, super quo lupus auriga, et vectus in illo fatuus: Homo enim externus non est homo, sed modo figura hominis, Internum enim, quod est sapere a Deo, facit hominem; similiter circumcisus et baptizatus, nisi circumcidat aut lavet cor suum.<p>
