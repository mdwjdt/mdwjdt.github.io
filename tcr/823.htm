823. 由于人通过遗传都是这种秉性, 所以在灵界, 凡被教皇册封为圣徒者都从他人眼前被抹去和隐藏, 从而剥夺他们与其崇拜者的一切联系, 以免激活他们里面最坏的恶根, 使他们陷入诸如恶魔所遭受的荒诞幻觉中。 在世时渴望死后成为圣徒, 以便被祈求之人就会陷入这种幻觉。 </p>

</h4>
<p>
823. Since all human beings inherit this tendency, the people who are saints, according to papal bulls, are removed in the spiritual world from the sight of others. They are hidden away and forbidden to have any interaction with people who worship them. The reason for this is to prevent that root, which is the most productive of evil, from becoming activated in them, giving them the deranged imagination that demons have. An insanity of this kind does take hold of people who, while they are still alive in the world, eagerly vie to become a saint after they die, so that people will pray to them. </p>

<p>
823. Since everyone has such a heredity, all who have been canonised by papal bulls are in the spiritual world removed from the sight of others and hidden, so as to deprive them of all contact with their worshippers. This is to prevent that worst of all roots of evils being aroused in them, so that they fall into the kind of delusions of the imagination that demons suffer from. Such delusion attacks those who, while they are living in the world, have the ambition of being invoked as saints after death. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #823 (Ager, 1970)
</h4>
<p>
823. Because of man's being such by inheritance, all those who have been made saints by papal bulls are removed from the sight of others in the spiritual world and kept out of sight; and are deprived of all interaction with their worshipers, lest that worst root of evils should be quickened in them, and they should be carried away into fantastic delusions such as prevail with demons. Into such delusions do those come who, while living in the world, earnestly seek to become saints after death, that they may be invoked. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #823 (Dick, 1950)
</h4>
<p>
823. Since man is of this nature by heredity, therefore all who have been canonized as saints by Papal bull, are removed in the spiritual world from the sight of others and concealed; and they are deprived of all intercourse with their worshipers lest this most pernicious root of evil should be fostered in them, and they should be plunged into the frenzied delusions by which demons are possessed. This madness affects those who, while living in the world, earnestly desired to be made saints after death, that they might be invoked. </p>

823. Quoniam homo ex haereditario talis est, ideo omnes, qui per Bullas Papales <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
sanctificati sunt, in Mundo spirituali removentur ab oculis aliorum, et reconduntur, et aufertur illis omne commercium cum cultoribus illorum; causa est, ne radix illa malorum pessima excitetur apud illos, et in deliria phantastica, qualia sunt apud daemones, inferantur: in talia deliria veniunt illi, qui dum in Mundo vivunt, Sancti <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
