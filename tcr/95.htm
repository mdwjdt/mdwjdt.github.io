<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>95</b>.（5）主通过救赎行为使自己成为公义。如今的基督教会都声称并相信，唯独主通过祂在世时对父神的顺服，尤其通过十字架受难而拥有功德和公义。不过，他们认为十字架受难本身就是救赎行为，然而，那并非救赎行为，而是荣耀其人性的行为（这是关于救赎的114－137节所论述的主题）。主借以使自己成为公义的救赎行为是祂在灵界所执行的最后审判。那时，祂将恶者与善者、山羊与绵羊分开，将那些与龙的兽沆瀣一气的人（启示录13章）逐出天堂。祂通过配得者组建了一个新天堂，通过不配者组建了一个新地狱，并逐步将各处的一切事物归回秩序，而且建立一个新教会。这些就是主借以使自己成为公义的救赎行为。因为公义就在于照神性秩序做一切事，并使一切脱离秩序的事物得以恢复。神性秩序本身就是公义。这就是主说这些话的含义：<br />我理当这样尽神诸般的义。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.15.htm">马太福音3:15</a>）<br />在旧约中还有这些经文：<br />看哪，日子将到，我要为大卫兴起一个公义的苗裔，祂必掌王权，在地上施行公平公义；这是祂的名，耶和华我们的义。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.5.htm">耶利米书23:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.6.htm">6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.15.htm">33:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.16.htm">16</a>）<br />我凭公义说话，以大能施行拯救。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.1.htm">以赛亚书63:1</a>）<br />祂必在大卫的宝座上以公平公义治理使国坚定稳固。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.7.htm">以赛亚书9:7</a>）<br />锡安必因公义得蒙救赎。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.27.htm">以赛亚书1:27</a>）</p>

95. (5)通過救贖行為, 主使自己為義。
<p>基督徒教會聲稱並堅信, 一切的功德與公義都唯獨歸給主, 因為祂在世對父上帝的順服,特別是十字架的受難。然而他們認為十字架受難就是救贖行為的本身。其實那並不是救贖的行為, 而是祂人性被榮耀的行為(在<a href="114.htm">114-137</a>節關於救贖的部分有所論述)。主使自己為義的救贖行為是這些:最後審判的執行(發生在心靈世界); 然後祂將惡者從善者分開,山羊從綿羊分開; 將那些與服侍紅龍之獸(啟示錄 13)聯合的從天國驅逐; 祂將那些配得上的組建新的天國, 將那些配不上的組建新的地獄; 將天國和地獄的一切恢復到聖規中; 建立新的教會。這些行為才是救贖的行為, 主藉此而成為義。因為義就在於做任何事情都遵循聖規, 將任何脫離聖規之事恢復到聖規之中。主以下的話就是此意:"我理當這樣盡諸般的義"(<a href="3927/matthew_3_15.htm">馬太福音3:15</a>)。舊約中也有此意:看哪, 日子將到, 我將為大衛興起一個苗裔, 祂將掌王權, 在地上秉公平行公義; 這是祂的名字:耶和華我們的義(<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">耶利米書23:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>)。我憑公義說話; 以大能拯救(<a href="3927/isaiah_63_1.htm">以賽亞書63:1</a>)。祂必在在衛的寶座上以公平和公義治理祂的國(<a href="3927/isaiah_9_7.htm">以賽亞書9:7</a>)。錫安必因公義得蒙救贖(<a href="3927/isaiah_1_27.htm">以賽亞書1:27</a>)。 </p>

95. 5. Through acts of redemption the Lord became justice. Christian churches nowadays say and believe that merit and justice belong to the Lord alone because of the obedience he gave in this world to God the Father and especially because of his suffering on the cross. They suppose, however, that the Lord's suffering on the cross was the act of redemption itself. That was not in fact an act of redemption; it was an act of glorification of his human nature (see the discussion of redemption under the next subheading [<a href="114.htm">114-137</a>]). The acts of redemption through which the Lord made himself justice were these: carrying out the Last Judgment, which he did in the spiritual world; separating the evil from the good and the goats from the sheep; driving out of heaven those who had joined the beasts that served the dragon [<a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13</a>]; assembling a new heaven of the deserving and a new hell of the undeserving; bringing both heaven and hell back into the divine design; and establishing a new church. These acts were the acts of redemption through which the Lord became justice. Justice is following the divine design in all that one does, and bringing back into the divine design things that have fallen away from that design. Justice is the divine design itself.
<p>These acts are meant by the following words of the Lord: "It is fitting for me to fulfill all the justice of God" (<a href="3927/matthew_3_15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>); also by these words in the Old Testament:
<p>Behold, the days are coming when I will raise up for David a righteous offshoot who will reign as king and execute justice on earth. And this is his name: Jehovah is our Justice. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>)
<p>I speak with justice; I am great in order to save. (<a href="3927/isaiah_63_1.htm">Isaiah 63:1</a>)
<p>He will sit on the throne of David to establish it with judgment and justice. (<a href="3927/isaiah_9_7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>)
<p>Zion will be redeemed with justice. (<a href="3927/isaiah_1_27.htm">Isaiah 1:27</a>) </p>

95. (v) THE LORD BY ACTS OF REDEMPTION MADE HIMSELF RIGHTEOUSNESS.<p>The Christian churches to-day say and believe that merit and righteousness belong to the Lord alone through the obedience He showed to God the Father, while He was in the world, in particular by His passion on the cross. But they have assumed that suffering the cross was itself the act of redemption; yet that was not it, but the act of glorifying His Human, a subject which will be discussed in the following section on redemption. The acts of redemption by which the Lord made Himself righteousness were His carrying out of the last judgment, which took place in the spiritual world. He then separated the wicked from the good and the goats from the sheep, expelling from heaven those who made common cause with the beasts of the dragon. From the worthy He founded a new heaven, from the unworthy a new hell; and by stages He brought everything everywhere back into order, and in addition He established a new church. These were the acts of redemption by which the Lord made Himself righteousness; for righteousness consists in doing everything in accordance with Divine order, and restoring everything which had slipped out of order. Divine order itself is righteousness. This is the meaning of these words of the Lord:<p>It is appropriate for me to fulfil all the righteousness of God, <a href="3927/matthew_3_15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>.<p>Also these passages in the Old Testament:<p>Behold, the days will come when I will raise up for David a righteous shoot, who will reign as king and do righteousness upon the earth; and this is his name, Jehovah our righteousness, <a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>.<p>I speak in righteousness, mighty to save, <a href="3927/isaiah_63_1.htm">Isaiah 63:1</a>.<p>He shall sit upon the throne of David to establish it in judgment and righteousness, <a href="3927/isaiah_9_7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>.<p>Zion shall be redeemed in righteousness, <a href="3927/isaiah_1_27.htm">Isaiah 1:27</a>. </p>

95. (5) Through the acts of Redemption the Lord made Himself Righteousness. It is said and believed in Christian churches at this day that the Lord alone has merit and righteousness through the obedience which He rendered to God the Father while in the world, and especially through the passion of the cross. But it is asserted that the essential act of redemption was the passion of the cross. This, however, was not an act of redemption, but an act of the glorification of His Human, a subject that will be considered in the succeeding chapter on Redemption. The acts of redemption whereby the Lord made Himself righteousness were as follows: He executed the final judgment, which took place in the spiritual world; at that time He separated the evil from the good and the goats from the sheep; He expelled from heaven those who made one with the beasts of the dragon; He formed out of the worthy a new heaven, and out of the unworthy a hell; in both heaven and hell He gradually restored all things to order; and to crown all, He established a new church. These acts were the acts of redemption whereby the Lord made Himself righteousness. For righteousness is doing all things in accordance with Divine order, and restoring to order whatever has fallen from order; since righteousness is Divine order itself. This is what is meant by these words of the Lord: <p>It becometh Me to fulfill all the righteousness of God (<a href="3927/matthew_3_15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>); <p>and by these words in the Old Testament: <p>Behold, the days come when I will raise up unto David a righteous Branch and He shall reign as King, and shall execute righteousness in the land. And this is His name, Jehovah our Righteousness (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5, 6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15, 16</a>) <p>I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save (<a href="3927/isaiah_63_1.htm">Isaiah 63:1</a>). <p>He shall sit upon the throne of David, to establish it in judgment and righteousness (<a href="3927/isaiah_9_7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>). <p>Zion shall be redeemed in righteousness (<a href="3927/isaiah_1_27.htm">Isaiah 1:27</a>). </p>

95. (5) THE LORD, BY ACTS OF REDEMPTION, MADE HIMSELF RIGHTEOUSNESS.<p>It is asserted and believed in the Christian Churches to-day that to the Lord alone belong merit and righteousness in virtue of the obedience which He yielded to God the Father while in the world, and especially by His Passion on the Cross. It is, however, imagined that the Passion on the Cross was itself the work of redemption, when yet it was not the work of redemption that was thereby effected, but the glorification of His Human. This will be treated in the following section on Redemption. The acts of redemption, by which the Lord made Himself Righteousness, were these: He carried out a last judgment, which took place in the spiritual world, separating the evil from the good, and the goats from the sheep; He drove out from heaven those who made common cause with the beasts of the dragon, founded a new heaven from those who were worthy, and a hell from the unworthy, and successively reduced all things everywhere to order; and finally He established the New Church. These were the acts of redemption by which the Lord made Himself Righteousness; for righteousness consists in doing all things according to Divine order, and in restoring to order whatever has departed from it, for Divine order itself is righteousness. Such things are signified by the words of the Lord when He says that:<p>"it becometh me to fulfil all the righteousness of God" <a href="3927/matthew_3_15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>;<p>and by these passages in the Old Testament:<p>"Behold, the days come... that I will raise unto David a righteous branch, and a king shall reign... and shall execute... righteousness in the earth... and this is His name, JEHOVAH our Righteousness" <a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_23_8.htm">8</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>;<p>"I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save" <a href="3927/isaiah_62_1.htm">Isaiah 62:1</a>;<p>He shall sit "upon the throne of David... to establish it with judgment and with justice" <a href="3927/isaiah_9_7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>;<p>"Zion shall be redeemed... with righteousness" <a href="3927/isaiah_1_27.htm">Isaiah 1:27</a>. </p>
