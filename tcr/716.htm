716. The Lord Himself and His Redemption Are Fully Present in the Holy Supper
<p>The Lord's own words show that he is fully present in the Holy Supper - that both his glorified humanity and his divinity, which was the source of his humanity, are present in it.
<p>The following passages show that his humanity is present in the Holy Supper: "Jesus took the bread, broke it, gave it to the disciples, and said, 'This is my body. ' And he took the cup, gave it to them, and said, 'This is my blood'" (Matthew 26:[26-28]; Mark 14:[22-24]; Luke 22:[17-20]). Similarly in John, "I am the bread of life. Anyone who eats this bread will live forever. The bread that I will give is my flesh. Truly, truly I say to you, those who eat my flesh and drink my blood live in me and I in them, and they will live forever" (John 6:[48, 51, 56, 58]). These passages clearly show that the Lord is present in the Holy Supper in his glorified humanity.
</p>
<p>
 [2] The following passages make it clear that the Lord is also wholly present in the Holy Supper in his divinity, which was the source of his humanity: He is the bread that came down from heaven (John 6:[51]). He in fact came down from heaven with all that divinity; we read that "The Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by it. And the Word became flesh" (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>). This point is also supported by the statements to the effect that the Father and he are one (<a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>); that all things that belong to the Father are his (<a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>; <a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">16:15</a>); and that he is in the Father and the Father is in him (<a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">John 14:10-11</a>, and so on).
<p>For another thing, his divinity could not have been separated from his humanity any more than a soul can be separated from its body. Therefore the statement just above that the Lord is fully present in the Holy Supper in his glorified humanity leads to the fact that his divinity, which was the source of his humanity, is also present in the Holy Supper.
<p>Given that his flesh means the divine goodness of his love, and his blood means the divine truth of his wisdom, it is clear that both the Lord's divinity and his glorified humanity are fully and infinitely present in the Holy Supper. As a result, it is a meal that is spiritual in nature. </p>

716. IV. The Lord is wholly present in the Holy Supper, and so is the whole of redemption.<p>The Lord is wholly present in the Holy Supper, both as regards His glorified Human and as regards the Divine from which the Human came; this is obvious from His actual words. These passages prove that His Human is present in the Holy Supper:<p>Jesus taking bread, broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, This is my body; and taking the cup, he gave it to them, saying, This is my blood, <a href="3927/matthew_26_1.htm">Matthew 26</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_1.htm">Mark 14</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_1.htm">Luke 22</a>.<p>Also in John:<p>I am the bread of life; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live for ever. The bread which I shall give is my flesh. Truly, truly, I tell you, he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him; and he lives for ever, <a href="3927/john_6_51.htm">John 6:51</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">56</a>.<p>These passages establish it as obvious that the Lord is present in the Holy Supper as regards His glorified Human.</p>
<p>
[2] The Lord is wholly present in the Holy Supper as regards His Divine, from which the Human came, as is obvious from the following: He is the bread which came down from heaven (<a href="3927/john_6_51.htm">John 6:51</a>). He came down from heaven together with the Divine, for we read:<p>The Word was with God, and the Word was God; all things were made by Him; and the Word was made flesh, <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>Further, the Father and He are one (<a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>); everything of the Father's is His (<a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>; <a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">16:15</a>); He is in the Father and the Father is in Him (<a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">John 14:10-11</a>, etc). Furthermore His Divine could no more be separated from His Human than the soul can be from the body. Therefore, when we say that the Lord is wholly present in the Holy Supper as regards His Human, it follows that His Divine from which the Human came is there together with it. Now since His flesh stands for the Divine good of His love, and His blood stands for the Divine truth of His wisdom, it is plain that the Lord is wholly omnipresent in the Holy Supper both as regards the Divine and as regards His glorified Human. Consequently this is a spiritual eating. </p>

716. IV. IN THE HOLY SUPPER THE LORD IS WHOLLY PRESENT WITH THE WHOLE OF HIS REDEMPTION. <p>It is evident from the Lord's very words that He is wholly present in the holy supper, in respect both to His glorified Human and the Divine from which the Human proceeded. That His Human is present in the holy supper is clear from the following: <p>Jesus took bread and brake, and gave to the disciples and said, This is My body; and He took the cup and gave them, saying, This is My blood (<a href="3927/matthew_26_26.htm">Matthew 26:26-28</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_22.htm">Mark 14:22-24</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_19.htm">Luke 22:19, 20</a>). <p>And in John: <p>I am the bread of life; if anyone eat of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread that I will give is My flesh. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood hath eternal life, and abideth in Me and I in him (<a href="3927/john_6_51.htm">John 6:51</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">56</a>). <p>From these words it is plainly evident that the Lord in respect to His glorified Human is in the holy supper. That He is also wholly present in it in respect to His Divine from which the Human proceeded, is evident from the statement, <p>That He is the bread that cometh down out of heaven (<a href="3927/john_6_51.htm">John 6:61</a>). <p>He came down out of heaven with the Divine, for it is written: <p>The Word was with God, and God was the Word; all things were made by Him and the Word was made flesh (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>). <p>And further, <p>That He and the Father are one (<a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>). <p>That all things belonging to the Father are His (<a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>, <a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">16:16</a>). <p>That He is in the Father and the Father in Him (<a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">John 14:10, 11</a>); <p>(and so forth). <p>Moreover, His Divine can no more be separated from His Human than the soul can be separated from the body; so when it is said that the Lord in respect to His Human is wholly present in the holy supper, it follows that His Divine from which was the Human is there along with it. Since then, His "flesh" signifies the Divine good of His love, and His "blood" the Divine truth of His wisdom, it is clear that the whole of the Lord is omnipresent in the holy supper in respect both to His Divine and to His glorified Human; consequently that the holy supper is a spiritual eating. </p>

716. IV IN THE HOLY SUPPER THE LORD IS WHOLLY PRESENT, AND THE WHOLE OF HIS REDEMPTION.<p>It is evident from the Lord's own words that He is wholly present in the Holy Supper, both as to the glorified Human and as to the Divine from which the Human proceeded. That His Human is present in the Holy Supper, is evident from these words:<p>"Jesus took bread... and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said... This is my body. And He took the cup and gave it to them, saying... This is my blood." <a href="3927/matthew_26_1.htm">Matthew 26</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_1.htm">Mark 14</a>; <a href="3927/luke_12_1.htm">Luke 12</a>.<p>Again in John:<p>"I am the living bread... If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the broad that I will give is my flesh... Verily, verily, I say unto you... He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwellth in me, and I in him... and he shall live for ever." <a href="3927/john_6_1.htm">6</a>.<p>From these words it is clearly evident that the Lord as to His glorified Human is present in the Holy Supper. That the Lord is also wholly present in the Holy Supper as to His Divine from which the Human proceeded, is evident from this, that He is the bread which came down from heaven, <a href="3927/john_6_1.htm">John 6</a>. He came down from heaven with the Divine, for it is said,<p>"The Word was with God, and the Word was God... All things were made by Him... And the Word was made flesh," <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>;<p>and further, from these statements,<p>That He and the Father are one, <a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>;<p>That all things of the Father are His, <a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>; <a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">16:15</a>;<p>That He is in the Father and the Father in Him, <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">John 14:10-11</a> and elsewhere.<p>It further appears from this consideration that His Divine can no more be separated from His Human than the soul from the body. Therefore, when it is said that the Lord as to His Human is wholly present in the Holy Supper, it follows that His Divine, from which His Human proceeded, is also present at the same time. Now, since the Lord's flesh signifies the Divine Good of His Love, and His blood the Divine Truth of His Wisdom, it is evident that the Lord, both as to the Divine and as to the glorified Human, is wholly omnipresent in the Holy Supper; and consequently it is a spiritual repast. </p>

716. Quod in Sancta Coena sit totus Dominus, et tota Ipsius Redemptio.<p>Quod in Sancta Coena sit totus Dominus tam quoad Humanum glorificatum, quam quoad Divinum ex Quo Humanum, evidens est ex ipsissimis Ipsius verbis. Quod Humanum Ipsius in Sancta Coena praesens sit, ex his, "Jesus accipiens Panem, ac fregit et dedit discipulis, et dixit, Hic est Corpus meum: et accipiens Poculum dedit illis, dicens, Hoc est Sanguis meus," <a href="3927/matthew_26_1.htm">Matthaeus 26</a>[26-28,] <a href="3927/mark_14_1.htm">Marcus 14</a>[22-24,] <a href="3927/luke_22_1.htm">Luca 22</a>[19-20]. Tum apud Johannem, "Ego sum Panis vitae; si quis comederit ex hoc Pane, vivet in aeternum; Panis quem Ego dabo, Caro mea est; amen, amen dico vobis, qui manducat meam Carnem, et bibit meum Sanguinem, in Me manet, et Ego in illo, et vivit in aeternum," <a href="3927/john_6_1.htm">Johannes 6</a>[51, 53, 56;] ex his evidenter constat, quod Dominus quoad Humanum suum glorificatum, in Sancta Coena sit.</p>
<p>
[2] Quod etiam totus Dominus quoad Divinum suum, a Quo Humanum, praesens in Sancta Coena sit, evidens est ex his, Quod Ipse sit Panis, qui e Coelo descendit, <a href="3927/john_6_1.htm">Johannes 6</a>[51;] e Coelo descendit cum Divino, nam dicitur, Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum; omnia per Ipsum facta sunt; et Verbum Caro factum est, <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">Johannes 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>, et porro ex his, quod Pater et Ipse unum sint, <a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">Johannes 10:30</a>.

Quod Ipse in Patre et Pater in Ipso sit, <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">Johannes 14:10-11</a>, etc. Et porro, quod Divinum Ipsius non plus separari possit ab Humano Ipsius, quam Anima a Corpore; quare cum dicitur, quod totus Dominus quoad Humanum Ipsius in Sancta Coena sit, sequitur quod Divinum Ipsius a Quo, simul etiam ibi sit. Nunc quoniam Caro Ipsius significat Divinum Bonum amoris Ipsius, et Sanguis Divinum Verum sapientiae Ipsius, patet quod totus Dominus tam quoad Divinum, quam quoad Humanum glorificatum, Omnipraesens in Sancta Coena sit; consequenter quod sit Manducatio spiritualis. </p>
