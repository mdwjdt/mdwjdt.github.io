<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第228节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>228</b>.由此可见，人若在没有教义的情况下阅读圣言，就会对一切真理含混不清。其心思游移不定，容易偏向谬误，并向异端敞开。倘若稍微有点好感或有权威助长，并且名声不会受损，他们就会信奉这些异端。对他们来说，圣言就象不发光的灯台，他们似乎在昏暗中看到很多东西。而事实上，他们几乎什么也没看见，因为唯有教义才是光的源头。我曾见证这种人接受天使检查，天使发现，他们能通过圣言随心所欲地确认任何事物，尤其用来确认凡属于他们自己的爱欲或他们所支持之人爱欲的任何事物。我还看到他们被剥去衣服，这标志着他们没有真理。因为在灵界，衣服就是真理。</p>

228. 這就說明, 那些沒有教義指引之人在讀聖言時, 對於一切真理, 他們都是摸著黑來找尋。他們的思想是搖擺不定的, 容易偏向偽謬, 甚至被引向異端邪說。倘若這些邪說稍有名氣或有權威支撐, 又或對自己的名譽無並點損傷和風險, 他們真的會信奉這些異端邪說。對他們而言, 聖言就像沒有燈光的燈檯, 在昏暗之中時, 他們自認為看到很多, 實際上幾乎未見何物, 因為唯有教義是指引的燈光。
<p>我親眼見證了天人如何考驗這類人, 發現他們能引用聖言來證明任何他們所期望的結果, 特別是用來證明那些滿足利己或利於自己所偏愛之人的事情。我看到他們脫掉衣服, 這是他們毫無真理的象徵。在那個世界中, 衣服是由真理構成。 </p>

228. It stands to reason, then, that people who read the Word without a body of teaching are in the dark about every truth. Their mind is meandering and undecided, liable to go astray, and even susceptible to heresies. Such people will in fact embrace heresies if those heresies have gained any popularity or authority and their own reputation is therefore not in danger. To them the Word is like a lampstand that gives no light. In the shadows they think they see many things, but in fact what they see is practically nothing, because a body of teaching is the only oil lamp.
<p>I have seen angels examining people like this and discovering that they were capable of using the Word to support whatever they wanted. The angels also discovered that these people do in fact support whatever they want, especially things that feed their love for themselves and for others they are partial to. I saw them stripped of their clothing, an indication that they had no truths. In that world, clothes are truths. </p>

228. These facts establish that those who read the Word without doctrine are in the dark as regards every truth. Their minds are vacillating and uncertain, prone to errors and easily led into heresies, and indeed they embrace these, if they have the slightest popularity or authoritative support, and provided there is no risk to one's own reputation. For them the Word is like a lampstand without any lights, and in the dim light they think they see much, when in fact they can see hardly anything, since it is only doctrine which is a source of light. I have witnessed such people being tested by angels, who found that they could prove from the Word anything they wished; and what they proved was especially what arose from their self-love or the love of those whom they favour. But I saw them stripped of their clothes, a sign that they were devoid of truths, for clothing in that world consists of truths. </p>

228. From all this it can be seen, that those who read the Word without doctrine are in obscurity respecting all truth; and that their minds are wavering and uncertain; prone to error and open to heresies, which they embrace when favor or authority encourages and reputation is not endangered. To such the Word is like a candelabrum without light, and they see many things as if in shade, and in fact see scarcely anything, for doctrine is the only lamp. I have seen such examined by angels, and it was found that they could confirm from the Word anything they wished; and that they did confirm especially whatever belonged to their own love or to the love of those whom they favor. I have also seen them stripped of their garments, which was a sign that they were destitute of truths. In the spiritual world garments are truths. </p>

228. It may therefore be evident that those who read the Word without doctrine are in obscurity concerning every truth. Their minds are wavering and unsettled, liable to errors and prone to heresies, which they eagerly embrace, if these are held in favor and supported by authority, and if their own reputation is not endangered. The Word to them is like a lampstand without a light, and they see many things, as it were, in the shade, yet understanding hardly anything, for doctrine alone is that which enlightens. I have seen such persons being examined by the angels, and they appeared able to confirm from the Word whatever opinion they pleased, and to confirm especially what pertained to their own self-love, and the love of those whom they befriended. But I have also seen them stripped of their garments, a sign that they were destitute of truths: for garments in the spiritual world are truths. </p>

228. Ex his constare potest, quod qui Verbum absque Doctrina legunt, sint in obscuro de omni veritate, et quod Mens eorum sit vaga et incerta, prona in errores, et quoque facilis ad haereses, quas etiam amplectuntur, si favor aut auctoritas aspirat, et fama non periclitatur: <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
est enim Verbum illis tanquam Candelabrum absque lumine, ac vident in umbra sicut multa, et tamen vix aliquid vident, nam sola Doctrina est lucerna: vidi tales exploratos ab Angelis, ac inventos, quod confirmare possent ex Verbo quodcunque volunt, et quod confirment, imprimis illa quae sunt amoris sui, et amoris illorum, quibus favent: at vidi illos nudatos vestibus, signum quod essent absque veris; vestes ibi sunt vera.<p>
