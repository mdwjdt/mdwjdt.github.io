<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>694</b>.记事三：<br />后来，我向前面提到的雅典娜城望去，听见那里有不寻常的喊叫声，夹杂着几分嘲笑，几分愤怒，几分悲哀。然而却没有因此不协调，而是很和谐，因为声音不是并列的，而是交织在一起。在灵界，人能通过声音清楚感知情感的种类与混和。我从远处问：“出了什么事？”他们说：“一位信使从基督教界的新人首次出现的地方来了，说他从世上来的三人那里听说，他们在世时和其他人一样，都认为死后祝福与快乐会止息全部劳作。因为凡是工作，无论行政的、公务的还是体力的，都是劳苦，只有摆脱这些才能安歇。这三人现被我们的信使带来了，正站在门口等候，所以引起一阵喧哗，他们商讨后决定，这三人不能象以前那样被带到帕尔纳索斯山上的帕拉斯神殿，而应到大礼堂，以便他们能披露基督教界的新闻；已派人正式引见他们。”我在灵里，对灵来说，距离取决于情感的状态，然后我有一种渴望，想亲眼看一看，听一听，于是，我发现自己当下就在这里，看见他们被带进来，听到他们交谈。<br />在大礼堂，年长和更有智慧者坐在两侧，其他人坐在中间。他们面前有一个高台，年轻人引导三个新人和信使庄严穿过礼堂中间，来到高台上；一阵沉默后，一个年龄大点的向他们致意，并问道：<br />“你们从地上带来什么新闻？”<br />“新闻有很多，但请告诉我们，你们想听哪方面的？”<br />“关于我们的世界和天堂。”<br />“我们到精灵界不久，听说无论这里还是天堂，都有行政机构、政府部门、公职、生意，各种科学研究和伟大着作。我们原以为从尘世转到或移居灵界后，必进入永恒的安息，摆脱一切劳作。但是，工作不就是劳作吗？”对此，年龄大点的回答说：“你们将摆脱劳苦的永恒安息理解为永远的无所事事，一直坐着、躺着，用力吸入快乐，大口喝下喜悦吗？”听到这句话，三人哂然一笑，说：“我们的确有这样的观点。”然后他们被反问：“喜悦，快乐与幸福和无所事事有什么共同点？”<br />“无所事事的结果是，意志变得消沉，而不是焕发，或说人变得死气沉沉，而不是富有活力。你们自己想象一下，若一个人百无聊赖地坐着，双手交叉，眼睛垂下，同时却被快乐的氛围环绕，他的脑袋与身体岂不昏昏欲睡？他脸上的生动表情岂不垮塌？最终，他的每根纤维都会松懈，以致他来回摇摆，直到倒在地上吗？除了精神的舒展外，还有什么能保持整个身体系统张驰有度呢？除了快乐履行的行政职责和工作任务外，还有什么能舒展精神？所以，我要告诉你们天上的这则消息：那里有政府，各个部门，上下级法院，以及工艺和工作。”<br />当三个新人听到天堂还有各级法院时，就说：“这是为何？所有在天堂者不都是被神启示和引领吗？他们怎会不知道什么是公平正义呢？那里有裁判的需要吗？”年龄大点的回答说：“在这个世界，我们被教导与学习何为善与真，以及何为公平公正，和尘世一样。我们不是从神直接学习这些东西，而是间接从其他人。所有天人，就象所有世人一样，都貌似凭自己思真行善，这善与真取决于天人的状态，所以并不纯粹，而是混杂的。此外，天人有的简单，有的聪明，聪明者必能对公义作出判断，而简单者则由于简单无知怀疑它、背离它。但因你们来这里时间不长，所以若你们愿意，请随我到我们的城市，我们会向你们展示一切。”于是，他们离开礼堂，一些年长者与他们同行。先来到一座大图书馆，它按学科被分成了较小的藏书。三个新人看到这么多书，惊奇道：“这个世界也有书籍吗？羊皮纸、纸张、笔与墨水从哪来的？”年龄大点的答道：“我们发觉，你们在世时以为这个世界是空的，因为它是灵性的。你们有这种观念，是因为你们认为灵性是抽象的；抽象的东西就是什么也没有，因此仿佛是空的。然而，这里的一切都是丰满的。这里的一切都是实质的，不是物质的，物质起源于实质。现在在这里的我们是灵人，因为我们是实质的，不是物质的。由于这个原因，物质世界的一切在这里都有完美地存在；所以我们有书籍、着作等更多东西。”当三个新人听到“实质”一词时，就确信无疑了，因为他们看见这里有书籍，听到说物质起源于实质。为使他们进一步信服，他们被带到文士之家，他们正在誊写该城智者的着作。他们仔细观看书写，惊讶于它的整洁和优雅。<br />之后，他们被带到研究机构、高中、大学，以及举行文学比赛的地方。这些比赛有的被称为赫利孔少女比赛（games of the Heliconides），有的被称为帕纳萨斯少女比赛（of the Parnassides），有的被称为雅典娜少女比赛（of the Athenaeides），有的被称为泉水少女比赛（the Virgins of the fountain）。他们说，这些比赛之所以如此命名，是因为少女代表对知识的情感，人的聪明才智取决于对知识的情感。如此称谓的比赛都是灵性操练和技能测试。后来，他们被带到该城各个地方，拜访了统治者（ruler）、管理者，以及行政官员，这些人向他们展示了工匠以灵性创作的奇妙作品。<br />参观完毕，年龄大点的又和他们聊起摆脱劳作的永远安息，就是死后幸福快乐之人所获得的那种。他说：“永远安息并非无所事事，因为那会使精神、因此也使整个身体陷入倦怠、麻木、迟钝与困乏的状态。这不是生命，而是死亡，更不是天上天人的永生。所以，永远安息是消除所有这些病态、使人存活的安息；它无非是鼓舞心智的东西，是振奋、活跃、娱乐心智的某种追求或工作。这一切靠“用”来实现，心智通过‘用’、为了‘用’而劳动。鉴于此，主视整个天堂为“用”的载体，使得天人成为天人的，正是他的‘用’。‘用’的快乐承载着他，如同水流承载船只，赋予他永远的平安，以及平安所给予的一切。这才是免于劳作的永远安息所表达的意思。天人活跃的程度取决于他的心智献身于‘用’的程度，这一点从以下事实明显可知，即人享受契合之爱，连同伴随它的生机、活力和快乐的深度，取决于他献身于真正‘用’的程度。”当三个新人确信永远安息并非无所事事，而是某种有用工作的乐趣时，一些少女走过来，向他们展示了自己亲手制作的女红刺绣，并把这些刺绣赠送给他们。然后，就在新人即将离开时，少女唱了一首歌，以天籁之音表达了对有用工作的情感，以及随之而来的乐趣。</p>

<h4 align="center">True Christianity #694 (Rose, 2010)
</h4>
<p>
694. The third memorable occurrence. A while later I looked in the direction of New Athens, a city that was introduced in an earlier account [], and I heard an unusual cry from there. It was a kind of laughter, but within the laughter there was a feeling of indignation, and within the indignation there was a sense of sadness. Yet it was not a cacophonous racket; it was harmonious, because the one sound was not competing with the others, but was within the others. (In the spiritual world, various emotions and the ways they combine are distinctly audible within a given sound.)
<p>While still at a distance, I asked: "What is going on?"
<p>"A messenger has come to us from the place where new arrivals from the Christian world first appear," the locals told me. "The messenger said he had heard from three people that in the world they had just left behind, they and everyone else believed those who are blessed and happy after death are going to experience complete rest from labor of all kinds. Since offices, jobs, and administrative positions are forms of labor, they thought there would be rest from these types of activity. Because the three people have been brought here by our emissary, and are standing at the gate and waiting, a great cry went up. A decision was immediately made to bring them not to the Palladium on New Parnassus as before but to the large auditorium, so that they can reveal the latest news from the Christian world. Delegates were sent out to them in order to give them a formal introduction to our assembly. "
<p>Because I was in the spirit, and spirits experience distances in accordance with their own desires, and I desired to see and hear them, I seemed to myself to become present there. I saw them brought in, and I heard what they said.
</p>
<p>
[2] The "elders," meaning the wiser people, were sitting at the sides of the auditorium; the rest were sitting in the middle. Before them all there was a stage. The three new arrivals and the messenger were brought in through the middle of the auditorium toward the stage in a formal procession accompanied by lesser dignitaries. After silence was obtained from the crowd, they were welcomed by an elder, and were asked, "What are the latest developments on earth [in regard to wisdom]?"
<p>The new arrivals said, "There are many new developments. Could you kindly specify a topic?"
<p>"What is new in the thinking on earth regarding our world and heaven?" the elder asked.
<p>"When we came into this world not long ago," they replied, "we were told that here and in heaven there are administrative positions, ministries, functions, businesses, research in all the academic disciplines, and amazing works of art and creativity. We had believed, however, that after we migrated or were transferred from the physical world into the spiritual world we would come into eternal rest from our labors [<a href="3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>]. What are jobs if not forms of labor?"
</p>
<p>
[3] "Did you take 'eternal rest from your labors' to mean never doing anything?" the elder asked. "Did you believe you would sit or lie down all the time, breathing in pleasures and swallowing joy?"
<p>The three new arrivals smiled sheepishly and said that they had had some such thought.
<p>"What do joy and pleasure and happiness have in common with doing nothing?" the elder continued. "When we are doing nothing, our mind does not develop; it collapses in on itself. Rather than bringing us to life, doing nothing is actually deadly for us.
<p>"Imagine people who are sitting in a completely idle state with their hands hanging down and their eyes either looking at the floor or closed altogether; and then imagine that at that very moment an aura of exquisite happiness comes pouring down all around them. Despite it, their own listlessness would continue to control their head and body. Any lively, uplifted expression that tried to form on their face would immediately fall off. Eventually, as all their ligaments and tendons loosened through inactivity, they would sway back and forth until they fell over on the floor. What else but the stretching of our minds keeps our entire bodily system intent and ready for action? And what stretches our mind more than our work and other responsibilities, when we take delight in doing them?
<p>"Therefore I will tell you some news from heaven: There are in fact administrative functions there, ministries, and higher and lower courts, as well as a variety of arts and skills that are practiced. "
</p>
<p>
[4] Upon hearing that there were higher and lower courts in heaven, the three new arrivals asked, "Why are there courts? Surely all who are in heaven are inspired and led by God, and therefore know what the just and right thing to do is. Why then would they need judges?"
<p>"In this world," the elder replied, "we are taught and we learn what is good and true, and also what is just and fair, much as we did in the physical world. We do not learn these things directly from God, however; we learn them indirectly through other people. Just as people on earth do, all angels consider what is true and practice what is good as if they were doing so on their own. Depending on the state they are in, their success in doing so is mixed and not pure. For another thing, some angels are just simple folk, whereas others are wise. The wise angels need to adjudicate when simple angels, because of their simplicity or ignorance, are unsure of what is right or depart from it.
</p>
<p>
[5] "But since you are still new arrivals in this world, why don't you follow me into our city, if that would suit you, and we will show you all there is to see. "
<p>They left the auditorium. Several of the elders accompanied them on a tour.
<p>First they visited a huge library, which was subdivided into collections for each of the various academic disciplines. The three new arrivals were dumbstruck to see the abundance of volumes. They said, "So there are books in this world too? Where do you get the paper and bindings, and the pens and the ink?"
<p>"We get the sense," the elders said, "that as long as you were in that world, you believed that this world had nothing in it because it was spiritual. The reason you had this belief was that you conceived of what is spiritual as something nonphysical; and your idea of something nonphysical was basically an idea of nothingness, like empty space.
<p>"In fact, though, there is a fullness of all things here. All the things that are here are substantial rather than physical. Physical things actually originate from substantial things. We who are here are spiritual people because we are substantial rather than physical. Therefore all the things that exist in the physical world are present here in their perfection, including books and documents, and much more. "
<p>When the three new arrivals heard the idea of substantial things, it struck them as true, both because they had seen the written volumes and because they had just heard their hosts say that physical matter originates in what is substantial.
<p>To reinforce these points, their hosts took them to visit the homes of scribes, who were copying original documents that had been written by the wise people of that city. The new arrivals inspected those products and were amazed at how precise and elegant the handwriting was.
</p>
<p>
[6] Then they were taken to see the various research institutes, schools, and colleges, and the places where literary games were held. Some of those games were called "the Games of the Maidens of Helicon"; some were called "the Games of the Maidens of Parnassus"; some were called "the Games of the Maidens of Athens"; and some were called "the Games of the Maidens of the Spring. " The reason the locals gave for these names was that maidens mean feelings of love for the various academic disciplines. They said that everyone's degree of intelligence depends on how much she or he loves these disciplines. The so-called games were actually academic exercises and spiritual debates.
<p>Then the new arrivals were taken around the city to see the government officials, and the administrators and their deputies. The deputies took them to see amazing works of art that artists had created using spiritual methods.
</p>
<p>
[7] After they had seen those things the elder spoke with them again on the subject of the eternal rest from labors that those who are blessed and happy come into after death.
<p>"Eternal rest," he said, "is not idleness. Complete inactivity causes first mental and then physical lethargy, inertia, unresponsiveness, and loss of consciousness. These are death, not life. They are far from the eternal life that is enjoyed by the angels of heaven.
<p>"Eternal rest, then, is a form of rest that keeps all those things at bay and makes us alive. What has this effect is something that lifts the mind; therefore it is some study or work that excites our mind, brings it to life, and gives it delight. This effect is produced by the usefulness that is the foundation, the context, and the purpose of our work. For this reason, the Lord regards the entirety of heaven as a context for usefulness. Each angel is an angel depending on how useful he or she is. The enjoyment we take in being useful carries us along as a helpful current carries a ship; it gives us everlasting peace and the rest that peace provides. This is what 'eternal rest from our labors' means.
<p>"In fact, the marriage love that angels have, and all the vigor, ability, and pleasure that go along with it, depends on their level of devotion to being genuinely useful. Clearly then, the very level of aliveness that angels feel depends on the level of their mental devotion to usefulness. "
</p>
<p>
[8] Once the three new arrivals were thoroughly convinced that eternal rest is not idleness, but is instead finding delight in some useful activity, several young women came forward with pieces of needlework and embroidery of their own making and gave them to the visitors. As the newly arrived spirits left, the young women sang them a song; through its angelic melody they expressed their love for useful activity and the pleasure it brings them. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #694 (Chadwick, 1988)
</h4>
<p>
694. The third experience. <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
<p>Some while later I looked towards the city of Athenaeum which I mentioned in the preceding account. I heard an unusual shouting coming from it. There was a certain amount of laughter in the shouting, and a certain amount of indignation in the laughter, and a certain amount of sadness in the indignation. Yet this shouting was not for this reason discordant; it was harmonious, because one element was not together with the other, but one was inside the other. In the spiritual world one can distinguish in sounds the mixture of differing affections.<p>I asked from a distance, 'What is happening?' 'A messenger,' they said, 'has come from the place where newcomers from the Christian parts of the world first appear, to say that he had heard from three people there, that in the world they had come from they shared the belief of other people that the blessed and happy would after death have total rest from their labours. Since administrative duties, offices and work are labours, they believed they would have rest from them. The three have now been brought by our emissary, and are standing waiting in front of the gate. So a great shouting has started, and they have deliberated and decided that they should not be brought into the Palladium on Parnassium, as in the previous case, but into the large auditorium, so that they can reveal their news from Christendom. Some people have been despatched to introduce them in due form.'<p>I was in the spirit, and distances for spirits depend upon the condition of their affections, and I then had a desire to see and hear them, so I found myself in their presence, watching them being brought in and hearing them talking.</p>
<p>
[2] The older and wiser people were seated at the sides of the auditorium, and the rest in the middle. There was a raised platform in front of them, and to this the three newcomers together with the messenger were conducted by younger men in a solemn procession through the middle of the auditorium. When silence had been obtained, they were greeted by one of the elders present and asked: 'What is the news from earth?'<p>'There is a lot of news,' they said, 'please tell us about what.'<p>'What is the news from earth,' replied the elder, 'about our world and about heaven?'<p>They replied that when recently they had arrived in this world they had heard that there and in heaven there are administrative duties, ministries, public offices, businesses, studies of all sciences and wonderful work. Yet they had believed that after their migration or transfer from the natural world to this spiritual one, they would come into everlasting rest from labours, and what were duties but labours?</p>
<p>
[3] To this the elder said: 'Did you understand everlasting rest from labours to mean everlasting leisure, in which you would continually sit or lie, plying your hearts with delights and filling your mouths with joys?' The three newcomers smiled gently at this, and said they had supposed something of the sort.<p>'What have joy,' they were asked in reply, 'and delights and so happiness got in common with leisure? The result of leisure is that the mind collapses instead of expanding, or one becomes as dead instead of lively. Imagine someone sitting completely at leisure, with his hands folded, his eyes cast down or withdrawn, and imagine him being at the same time surrounded with an aura of cheerfulness; would not his head and body be gripped by lassitude, the lively expression of his face would collapse, and eventually his every fibre would become so relaxed that he would sway to and fro until he fell to the ground? What is it that keeps the whole system of the body stretched and under tension but the stretching of the mind? And what is it that stretches the mind but administrative duties and tasks, so long as they are enjoyable? So I will tell you some news from heaven: there are there administrative duties, ministries, higher and lower law-courts, as well as crafts and work.'</p>
<p>
[4] When the three newcomers heard that in heaven there were higher and lower law-courts, they said: 'Why is that? Are not all in heaven inspired and led by God, so that they know what is just and right? What need then is there of judges?'<p>'In this world,' replied the elder, 'we are taught and learn what is good and true, and what is just and fair, in the same way as in the natural world. We do not learn these things directly from God, but indirectly through others. Every angel, just as every man, thinks what is true and does what is good as if of himself, and this, depending upon the angel's state, is not pure truth and good, but mixed. Among angels too there are simple and wise people, and it will be for the wise to judge, when the simple as the result of their simplicity or their ignorance are in doubt about what is just, or depart from it.</p>
<p>
[5] But if you, who have still not been long in this world, would be good enough to accompany me to our city, we shall show you everything.'<p>So they left the auditorium, and some of the elders went with them. They came first to a large library, which was divided into smaller collections of books by subjects. The three newcomers were astonished to see so many books, and said: 'Are there books in this world too? Where do they get parchment and paper, pens and ink?'<p>'We perceive,' said the elders, 'that you believed in the previous world that this world is empty, because it is spiritual. The reason for this belief of yours is that you entertained the idea that the spiritual is abstract; and that what is abstract is nothing and so as if empty. Yet here everything is in its fulness. Everything here is substantial, not material; material things owe their origin to what is substantial. We who are present here are spiritual people, because we are substantial, and not material. This is why everything that is in the material world exists here in its perfection; so we have books and writing, and much more.'<p>When the three newcomers heard the term substantial mentioned, they thought this must be so, both because they saw there were books written and because they heard it said that matter originates from substance. To give them further proof of this, they were taken to the houses of scribes, who were making copies of books written by the city's wise men. They looked at the writing and were surprised how neat and elegant it was.</p>
<p>
[6] After this they were taken to research institutions, high schools and colleges, and to the places where their literary contests took place. Some of these were called contests of the Maidens of Helicon, some those of the Maidens of Parnassus, some those of the Maidens of Athena and some those of the Maidens of the Spring-waters. They said that they were so named because maidens stand for the affections for branches of knowledge, and everyone's intelligence depends upon his affection for knowledge. The contests so called were spiritual exercises and gymnastics. Later, they were taken around the city to visit controllers, administrators and their officials and these showed them the remarkable work performed by craftsmen in a spiritual manner.</p>
<p>
[7] When they had seen this, the elder talked with them again about the everlasting rest from labours the blessed and happy obtain after death. 'Everlasting rest,' he said, 'is not leisure, since that reduces the mind and so the whole body to a state of feebleness, torpidity, stupidness and somnolence. These are not life, but death, much less the everlasting life of the angels in heaven. So everlasting rest is a rest that banishes all those ills and makes people alive. This can only be something that uplifts the mind. So it is some interest or task which excites, enlivens and delights the mind. This depends upon the purpose for which, in which and towards which it aims. This is why the whole of heaven is seen by the Lord as a coherent purpose, and it is the purpose he serves that makes every angel an angel. The pleasure of service carries him along, as a favourable current does a ship, and confers upon him everlasting peace and the rest peace gives. This is what is meant by everlasting rest from labours. The extent to which an angel is alive depends upon his mental commitment arising from service. This is perfectly clear from the fact that the depth of conjugial love anyone enjoys, together with the manliness, potency and delights that accompany it, depend upon his commitment to true service.'</p>
<p>
[8] When it had been proved to the three newcomers that everlasting rest is not leisure, but the pleasure of some work that is of service, some girls came with embroidery and sewing, their own handiwork, and presented these to them. Then, as the new spirits took their departure, the girls sang a song expressing in an angelic melody their affection for useful work and its attendant pleasures.<p>

694. Third Memorable Relation: <p>Sometime afterward I looked toward the city Athenaeum, spoken of in the foregoing Memorable Relation, and I heard a strange noise coming from it. There was in it something of laughter, in this something of indignation, and in this still something of sadness; and yet the noise was not discordant but harmonious, because the sounds were not simultaneous, but were one within the other. In the spiritual world the variety and commingling of affections is distinctly perceived in the tone of the voice. <p>At a distance I asked, "What is the matter?" They answered, "A messenger has arrived from the place where newcomers from the Christian world first appear, saying that he has heard from three persons there that in the world from which they had come, they in common with others there had believed that after death the blessed and happy would have rest from all kinds of labor; and because administrations, and official and manual employments are labors, there would be rest from these. And as these three have now been brought here by our messenger, and stand waiting at the door, a clamor has arisen; and after consultation it has been decided that they should not be introduced into the Palladium on Parnassium as the former new-comers had been, but into the great auditorium there, that they may tell their news from the Christian world; and some have been sent to introduce them formally." <p>As I was in the spirit, and as with spirits distances are according to the state of their affections, and as I then had an affection for seeing and hearing the newcomers, I seemed to myself to be there present, and I saw them introduced and heard them speak.
</p>
<p>
[2] In the auditorium the older or wiser sat at the sides, and the others in the center, and in front of these was a raised floor. The three new-corners with the messenger were conducted hither, through the middle of the auditorium, by the younger ones in formal attendance; and when silence had been obtained they were introduced by one of the elders, and asked, "What news from earth?" <p>They replied, "There is much news; but pray tell us to what subject your inquiry refers." <p>The elder replied, "What news from earth respecting our world and heaven?" <p>They answered, "When we first arrived in this world, we heard that both here and in heaven there are governments, ministerial offices, occupations, business, all kinds of studies, and wonderful works; although our belief had been that after our removal or transfer from the natural world into this spiritual world, we should enter into eternal rest from labors. But what are occupations but labors?"
</p>
<p>
[3] To this the elder replied, "By eternal rest from labor did you understand eternal idleness, wherein you would constantly sit and lie, inhaling delights with the breast, and drinking in joys with the mouth?" <p>The three newcomers smiled pleasantly at this and said, "We did entertain some such opinion." <p>They were then asked, "What has joy, delight, and consequent happiness in common with idleness? By idleness the mind is not expanded but dissipated; that is, man is deadened by it, not vivified. Picture to yourselves a man sitting in utter idleness, his hands hanging down, his eyes cast down or withdrawn, and at the same time surrounded by an aura of delight; would not a lethargy seize upon both his head and body, the vital expansion of his face give way, and with relaxed fibers would he not nod and nod, until he fell to the ground? What keeps the whole bodily system expanded and tense, but the tension of the mind? And whence comes the mind's tension but from administrative duties and works, when they are performed from delight? I will therefore tell you this news from heaven, that there are governments here, ministerial duties, judicial tribunals, greater and less, as also mechanical and other employments."
</p>
<p>
[4] When the three newcomers heard that there were greater and lesser judicial tribunals in heaven they said, "Why so? Are not all who are in heaven inspired and led by God, and do they not therefore know what is just and right? What need then of judges?" <p>The elder replied, "In this world we are taught and learn what is good and true, also what is just and equitable, the same as in the natural world, and these things we learn not immediately from God, but mediately through others; and every angel, like every man, thinks what is true and does what is good as if of himself, this being not pure but mixed, according to the state of the angel. Moreover, among angels some are simple and some wise, and the wise must judge of what is just, while the simple from their simplicity and ignorance are in doubt about it of depart from it.
</p>
<p>
[5] But as you are yet new in this world, follow me, if you would like to do so, into our city, and we will show you everything." <p>And they left the auditorium, others of the elders also accompanying them; and first entered a large library, which was divided into smaller libraries, each devoted to a different branch of knowledge. The three new-comers, seeing so many books, were amazed, and said, "Are there books in this world also?" Where do the parchment, paper, pens and ink come from?" <p>The elders replied, "We perceive that in the former world you believed this world to be empty because it is spiritual; and this you believed because you cherished an idea of the spiritual as something abstract from the material; and what is abstract from the material seemed to you like nothing, thus like a vacuum; and yet here is an abundance of all things. All things here are substantial, not material, and material things have their origin in the substantial. We who are here are spiritual men, because we are substantial and not material. For this reason all things that exist in the natural world exist here in their perfection, even books and writings and many other things." <p>When the three newcomers heard the word substantial, they recognized the truth of the matter, both from seeing the written books and from hearing that matter originates in substance. To convince them still further, they were taken to the abodes of the writers who transcribed the writings of the wise men of the city; and they examined the writings and wondered at their neatness and elegance.
</p>
<p>
[6] After this they were conducted to the museums, gymnasia, colleges, and places where they held their literary games, some called the games of the Heliconides, some of the Parnassides, some of the Athenaeides, and some of the Virgins of the fountain. They said that the latter were so named because virgins signify affections for knowledges, according to which affections everyone has intelligence. The so-called games were spiritual exercises and trials of skill. After this they were conducted about the city to the rulers, administrators, and their officers, and by these latter to the wonderful works which their workmen execute in a spiritual manner.
</p>
<p>
[7] When these things had been seen, the elder again spoke to them about the eternal rest from labor, into which the blessed and happy enter after death. He said, "Eternal rest is not idleness, for idleness produces a languid, torpid, stupid, and sleepy state of the mind, and therefrom of the whole body; and this is not life but death, still less is it the eternal life which the angels of heaven live. Eternal rest is therefore a rest that dispels that state and causes man to live; thus it is nothing else than what elevates the mind; and is some pursuit or work by which the mind is aroused, enlivened, and delighted; and this is accomplished in the measure of the use from which, and for which the mind labors. Because of this the whole heaven is regarded by the Lord as a containant of uses, and every angel is an angel in the measure of his use. Delight in use bears him on as a favoring current does a ship, causing him to be in eternal peace and in the rest of peace. This is what is meant by eternal rest from labor. That an angel is alive in the measure of the application of his mind to use is very manifest from this, that everyone has conjugial love with its vigor, potency, and delights, according to his application to the genuine use in which he is engaged." <p>When the three newcomers had been convinced that eternal rest is not idleness, but the delight arising from some useful work, some virgins came and presented them with needlework and embroidery made with their own hands; and as the newcomers were departing, the virgins sang an ode in which they expressed in angelic melody the affection for useful labor and its charms. </p>

694. The third experience. Some time afterwards I was looking towards the city Athenaeum, mentioned in the preceding narrative, and I heard an unusual clamor come from it. In the sound there was laughter, and in this there was indignation, and in this again there was sadness. Still, however, the clamor was not on that account discordant; but it was harmonious, because the sounds were not heard separately, but one within the other. For in the spiritual world a combination of various emotions is distinctly perceived in sound. I inquired from a distance what the matter was, and I received this reply: "A messenger has arrived from the place where new comers from the Christian world first appear. He has heard from three persons there that in the world from which they have come they shared the belief that the blessed and happy after death would have perfect rest from labors; and because administrative duties, offices and employments are labor, there would be rest from them. As these three persons have been brought here by our messenger, and now stand waiting to be admitted, a cry has gone up. After consultation it has been decided that they should not be admitted into the Palladium <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
on Parnassium, <sup "fn9_2">2</sup>
as the former strangers were, but into the great audience hall there, in order to announce their news from the Christian world; and deputies have been sent to introduce them with due ceremony.<p>I was in the spirit, and distances with spirits are according to the state of their affections. As I then desired to see and hear them, I was immediately present at the place; and I saw them introduced, and heard them speak.</p>
<p>
[2] The elders, or wiser ones, sat at the sides of the hall, and the rest in the centre. Facing the latter was a raised platform; and to this the three new comers with the messenger were conducted with due ceremony by the younger members of the assembly through the middle of the hall. As soon as there was silence, they were greeted by a certain one of the elders, who then asked, "What news from the earth?" They replied, "There is much that is new; but pray tell us on what subject you would like us to speak. The elder answered, "What is the news from the earth concerning our world and heaven?" They replied: "When we first came into this world we were informed that here and in heaven there are administrative duties, occupations, offices, employments, the pursuit of all kinds of learning, and wonderful pieces of workmanship. Yet we used to believe that after our departure or translation from the natural world into this spiritual world we should come into eternal rest from labors; and what the employments but labors?"</p>
<p>
[3] To this the elder said: "Did you understand by eternal rest from labors, eternal idleness, when you would be continually sitting or lying down, summoning for your enjoyment the delights of the mind and the pleasures of the senses?" The three strangers, with a pleasant smile, said they had supposed some such thing. "But," was the reply, "what have pleasures and delights, and the happiness they bring, in common with idleness? By idleness the mind is destroyed, not expanded, or, in other words, the man is deadened and not enlivened. Suppose that a person were sitting in perfect idleness, with his hands hanging down, and his eyes downcast or uplifted; and suppose that he were at the same time surrounded by an atmosphere of gladness, then a lethargy would seize both his head and body, the lively expression of his face would fall away, and with nerves and sinews relaxed, he would nod and nod until he collapsed to the ground. What is it that keeps the whole bodily system expanded and tense, but the tension of the mind? and this tension comes only from administrative duties and employment, when these are performed with pleasure. I will, therefore, tell you this news from heaven, that there are in heaven administrative duties, occupations, courts of justice, higher and lower, as well as mechanical arts and services."</p>
<p>
[4] When the three strangers heard that there were courts of justice, higher and lower, in heaven, they said, "Why so? Are not all in heaven inspired and guided by God, and do they not, therefore, know what is just and right? What need then of judges?" "In this world," replied the elder, "we are instructed, and learn what is good and true, and also what is just and equitable, as in the natural world; and these things we learn not immediately from God, but mediately through others. Besides every angel, like every man, thinks what is true and does what is good as from himself; and the results are more or less true and good according to the state of the angel. Further, among the angels there are some who are simple and some who are wise; and the wise will judge what is right, while the simple in their simplicity and ignorance hesitate, or even depart from it.</p>
<p>
[5] But as you are new to this world, if agreeable to you, come with me into our city, and we will show you everything." Thereupon they left the audience hall, accompanied by some of the seniors.<p>They first entered a large library, which was divided into sub-sections according to the different branches of knowledge. When the three strangers saw so many books they were astonished, and said, "There are books too, in this world! Where do the parchment, paper, pens and ink come from?" "We perceive," the seniors replied, "that in the former world you believed this world, being spiritual, to be empty; and this you believed because you conceived the spiritual to be an abstraction from the material. As an abstraction from the material appeared to you as nothing at all, you supposed this world to be a void, when in truth there is here the plenitude of all things. In this world all things are substantial <sup "fn9_3">3</sup>
and not material, and material things originate from the substantial. We in this world are spiritual men because we are substantial, and not material. It follows, therefore, that all things which exist in the natural world, including books and manuscripts, are found here in their perfection." When the three strangers heard these things called substantial, they understood what it meant, for they saw the written books and were told that matter has its origin from substance. That they might be still further convinced on these points, they were taken to the houses of scribes who were making copies of what had been written by the wise men of the city. They examined the writing carefully, and wondered at seeing it so neat and elegant.</p>
<p>
[6] After this they were conducted to their places of learning, the museums, gymnasiums, and colleges, and to the places where were held their literary sports. Some of these were called after Heliconeum, <sup "fn9_4">4</sup>
Parmassium and Athenaeum, and some after the Virgins of the fountain. It was said that these last were so named because virgins signify the love of knowledge, and every one is intelligent in proportion to his love of knowledge. The sports, as they were termed, were spiritual exercises and trials of skill. The strangers were afterwards conducted about the city, visiting the rulers, administrators, and their subordinate officials, by whom they were taken to view the wonderful works constructed by workmen in spiritual style.</p>
<p>
[7] When they had seen these things, the elder spoke with them again about the eternal rest from labors into which the blessed and happy come after death. "Eternal rest," he said, "is not idleness, for idleness produces languor, sluggishness, numbness and drowsiness of the mind, and consequently of the whole body; and these are death, not life, much less the eternal life which the angels of heaven enjoy. Eternal rest, therefore, is a rest that dispels these states and enables a man to live; and it is only this that elevates the mind. It consists therefore in some pursuit or occupation by which the mind is aroused, quickened and delighted; and this follows according to the use from which, in which and for which the work is performed. Thus the whole heaven is viewed by the Lord as a sphere of uses, and every angel is an angel according to his use. The delight of use bears him along as a favorable current does a ship, causing him to be in eternal peace, and in the rest of peace. This is the meaning of eternal rest from labors. That an angel is quickened as his mind is applied to use is plainly evident from the fact that every one enjoys conjugial love in its vigor, potency and delight according to his love of its use."<p>When the three strangers had been thus convinced that eternal rest is not idleness but joy in the performance of useful work, some maidens came and presented them with embroidered and woven articles, examples of their own handiwork. As the new comers were departing, the maidens sang an ode expressing in heavenly strains the love of useful work and its pleasures.<p>

694. TERTIUM MEMORABILE.<p>Post aliquod tempus spectavi ad urbem Athenaeum, de qua in priori Memorabili aliquid dictum est, et audivi inde clamorem insolitum; erat in illo aliquid risus, in hoc aliquid indignationis, et in hac aliquid maestitiae; at usque clamor ille non inde erat dissonus, sed consonus, quia unum non erat simul cum altero, sed unum intra alterum; in Mundo spirituali percipitur in sono distincte varietas et commixtura affectionum. Quaesivi e longinquo, quid rei; et dixerunt, venit nuntius e loco, ubi advenae e Christiano Orbe primum apparent, dicens, quod a Tribus ibi audiverit, quod in Mundo, unde venerunt, cum reliquis ibi crediderint, quod beatis et felicibus post mortem futura sit omnimoda requies a laboribus; et quia administrationes, officia et operae sunt labores, quod requies ab illis futura sit: et quia tres illi ab Emissario nostro nunc adducti sunt, et stant ante portam et exspectant, factus est Clamor, et ex consulto statuerunt, quod non in Palladium in Parnassio, ut priores, sed in magnum Auditorium ibi introducerentur, ut aperiant Nova sua e Christiano Orbe; et ablegati sunt aliqui, qui solenniter illos introducerent. Quia eram in spiritu, et spiritibus distantiae sunt secundum status affectionum illorum; et quia tunc mihi affectio videndi et audiendi illos erat, visus mihi sum praesens ibi, et vidi introductos, et audivi loquentes.</p>
<p>
[2] Sederunt in Auditorio Seniores seu Sapientiores ad latera, ac reliqui in medio; et ante hos erat elevatum solum; huc tres Advenae cum nuntio in solenni comitatu a minorennibus per medium Auditorii deducti sunt; et post silentium factum, salutati sunt a quodam Majorenni ibi, et quaesiti, QUID NOVI E TERRA; et dixerunt, sunt multa Nova, sed dic quaeso de qua re, et respondit Majorennis, QUID NOVI E TERRA DE NOSTRO MUNDO ET DE COELO; et responderunt, quod cum recentes in hunc Mundum venimus, audiverimus, quod ibi et in Coelo sint Administrationes, Ministeria, Functiones, Negotiationes, Studia omnium disciplinarum, et mirabiles Operae; et tamen credidimus quod post migrationem seu translationem e Mundo naturali in hunc Spiritualem, in aeternam requiem a laboribus venturi simus; et quid functiones nisi labores:</p>
<p>
[3] ad haec Majorennis dixit, num per aeternam requiem a laboribus intellexistis aeternum otium, in quo continue sederetis et cubaretis, attrahentes delitias pectore, et sorbentes gaudia ore; ad haec tres Advenae blande ridentes dixerunt, quod aliquid tale autumaverint; et tunc responsum est illis, quid gaudia, et delitiae, et inde felicitas, commune habent cum otio; ex otio collabitur mens et non expanditur, seu mortificatur homo et non vivificatur; pone aliquem sedentem in pleno otio, remissis manibus, dejectis aut subductis oculis, et pone ut ille simul circumfundatur aura laetitiae; numne Veternus occuparet et caput et corpus ejus, ac vitalis expansio faciei concideret, et tandem ille relaxatis fibris nutaret et nutaret, usque dum caderet in terram; quid in expansione et tensione tenet totius corporis systema, quam intensio animi; et unde intensio animi, nisi ex administraturis et operis, dum fiunt ex jucundo; quare dicam vobis Novum e Coelo, quod ibi sint administrationes, ministeria, judicia majora et minora, tum artificia et operae.</p>
<p>
[4] Tres advenae, cum audiverunt, quod in Coelo essent Judicia majora et minora, dicebant, cur illa; annon omnes in Coelo inspirantur et ducuntur a Deo, et inde sciunt quid justum et rectum; quid tunc opus judicibus; et respondit Vir majorennis, in hoc Mundo instruimur et discimus quid bonum et verum, tum quid justum et aequum, similiter ut in Mundo naturali, et haec discimus non immediate a Deo, sed mediate per alios; et omnis Angelus, sicut omnis homo, cogitat verum, et facit bonum <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
sicut a se, et hoc secundum statum Angeli est mixtum, et non purum; et quoque inter Angelos dantur simplices et sapientes, et sapientes judicabunt, dum simplices ex simplicitate et ex ignorantia ambigunt de justo, aut abeunt ab illo.</p>
<p>
[5] Sed vos, quia recentes adhuc in hoc Mundo estis, si sit beneplaciti vestri, sequimini me in Urbem nostram, et monstrabimus omnia; et exiverunt Auditorio, et aliqui ex Senioribus etiam illos comitati sunt; et primum in Bibliothecam magnam, quae secundum scientias distincta erat in Libraria minora: tres illi Advenae, visis tot libris, obstupefacti sunt, et dixerunt, sunt etiam in hoc Mundo Libri, unde membranae et chartae; unde calami et atramentum; ad haec dixerunt Seniores, percipimus quod credideritis in Mundo priori, quod hic Mundus vacuus sit, quia spiritualis; et quod hoc credideritis, est quia ideam de spirituali fovistis abstractam a materiali; et abstractum a materiali apparuit vobis sicut nihilum, ita sicut vacuum; cum tamen hic est plenitudo omnium; sunt hic omnia SUBSTANTIALIA et non materialia, et materialia suam originem ducunt ex substantialibus; nos qui hic sumus, homines spirituales sumus quia substantiales, et non materiales; inde est, quod hic dentur omnia quae in Mundo naturali in sua perfectione, <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
etiam libri et scripturae, et multo plura; tres Advenae cum audiverunt nominari SUBSTANTIALIA, cogitaverunt quod ita sit, tam quia viderunt Libros scriptos, quam quia audiverunt dictum, quod materiae originitus sint ex substantiis. Ut adhuc de his confirmarentur, delati sunt ad Domicilia scribarum, qui exscribebant exemplaria a sapientibus urbis conscripta, et inspiciebant scripturas, et mirati sunt, quod tam nitidae et politae essent.</p>
<p>
[6] Post haec deducti sunt ad Musaea, Gymnasia et Collegia, et ubi erant Ludi illorum literarii, quorum aliquos vocabant Heliconidum, aliquos ludos Parnassidum, aliquos ludos Atheneidum, et aliquos ludos Virginum fontis; dicebant quod hi ita appellentur, quia Virgines significant affectiones scientiarum, et secundum affectionem scientiarum est cuivis intelligentia; Ludi ita vocati, erant exercitationes et palaestrae <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
spirituales. Postea circumducti sunt in urbe ad Moderatores, Administratores, et horum Officiarios, et per hos ad mirabiles Operas, quae ab artificibus spirituali modo fiunt.</p>
<p>
[7] Postquam haec visa sunt, iterum cum illis loquutus est Vir majorennis de Requie aeterna a laboribus, in quam veniunt beati et felices post mortem, et dixit, Requies aeterna non est otium, quoniam ex otio est mentis et inde totius corporis, languor, torpor, stupor et sopor, et haec sunt mors et non vita, et minus vita aeterna, in qua sunt Angeli Coeli; quare Requies aeterna est requies quae discutit illa, et facit ut homo vivat; et hoc non aliud est, quam tale quod elevat mentem; est itaque aliquod studium et opus, ex quo excitatur, vivificatur, et delitiatur mens; et hoc fit secundum usum, ex quo, in quo, et ad quem operatur; inde est, quod Universum Coelum spectetur a Domino ut continens usus, et quisque Angelus est Angelus secundum usum; jucundum usus fert illum sicut secunda vena navem, et facit ut in aeterna pace, et pacis requie sit; ita intelligitur Aeterna requies a laboribus. Quod Angelus sit vivus secundum studium mentis ex usu, patet manifeste ex eo, quod cuivis sit Amor conjugialis cum ejus virtute, potentia et delitiis, secundum studium genuini usus in quo est.</p>
<p>
[8] Postquam tres illi Advenae confirmati sunt, quod Aeterna requies non sit otium, sed jucundum alicujus operis quod usui est, <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
venerunt aliquae Virgines cum acupictus et netis, operibus manuum suarum, et donaverunt illis; et Virgines, cum abibant novitii illi spiritus, cecinerunt oden, qua affectionem operum usus cum amaenis <sup "fn120_5">5</sup>
ejus, melo angelico exprimebant.<p>
