610. The following needs to be added to what has been stated so far: Our regeneration does not happen in a moment. It gradually unfolds from the beginning all the way to the end of our lives in this world; and after this life is over, it continues and is perfected.
<p>Because we are reformed through battles and victories against the evils of our flesh, the Son of Humankind says to each of the seven churches that gifts will be given to those who overcome. That is, to the church in Ephesus he says, "To those who overcome I will give [food] to eat from the tree of life" (<a href="3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>). To the church in Smyrna he says, "Those who overcome will suffer no harm from the second death" (<a href="3927/revelation_2_11.htm">Revelation 2:11</a>). To the church in Pergamos he says, "To those who overcome I will give the hidden manna to eat" (<a href="3927/revelation_2_17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>). To the church in Thyatira he says, "To those who overcome I will give power over the nations" (<a href="3927/revelation_2_26.htm">Revelation 2:26</a>). To the church in Sardis he says, "Those who overcome will be clothed in white garments" (<a href="3927/revelation_3_5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>). To the church in Philadelphia he says, "Those who overcome I will make pillars in the temple of God" (<a href="3927/revelation_3_12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>). To the church in Laodicea he says, "To those who overcome I will grant to sit with me on my throne" (<a href="3927/revelation_3_21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>).
<p>Let me also add the following as a final note: The more we are reborn, that is, the more the process of regeneration is perfected in us, the less we attribute anything of goodness and truth, or goodwill and faith, to ourselves; we attribute it all to the Lord. We are taught this very clearly by the truths that we keep drinking in. </p>

610. I will add to what I have already said the following point. A person's regeneration does not occur in an instant, but successively from the beginning to the end of his life in the world, and after this it continues and reaches higher perfection. It is because a person is reformed by struggles and victories over the evils of his flesh that the Son of Man says to each of the seven churches, that He will grant gifts to him who overcomes. Thus to the church at Ephesus:<p>To him who overcomes I will grant to eat of the tree of life, <a href="3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>.<p>To the church of the people of Smyrna:<p>He who overcomes will not suffer harm in the second death, <a href="3927/revelation_2_11.htm">Revelation 2:11</a>.<p>To the church in Pergamum:<p>To him who overcomes I will grant to eat of the hidden manna, <a href="3927/revelation_2_17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>.<p>To the church in Thyatira:<p>To him who overcomes I will grant power over the nations, <a href="3927/revelation_2_26.htm">Revelation 2:26</a>.<p>To the church in Sardis:<p>He who overcomes will be clothed in white raiment, <a href="3927/revelation_3_5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>.<p>To the church in Philadelphia:<p>Him who overcomes I will make a column in God's temple, <a href="3927/revelation_3_12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>.<p>To the church of the people of Laodicea:<p>To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with me on my throne, <a href="3927/revelation_3_21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>.<p>One final point: to the extent that a person is regenerated, that is, in so far as his regeneration advances towards perfection, to that extent he ceases to attribute to himself any good or truth, that is, any charity and faith, but attributes these to the Lord. For the truths that he absorbs one after the other plainly teach that lesson. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #610 (Ager, 1970)
</h4>
<p>
610. To the foregoing this shall be added, that man's regeneration is not effected in a moment, but gradually, from the beginning to the end of his life in the world, and is afterward continued and perfected. And because man is reformed by conflicts with the victories over the evils of his flesh, the Son of man says to each one of the seven churches, that he will give gifts to him that overcometh; as to the church of Ephesus: <p>To him that overcometh I give to eat of the tree of life (<a href="3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>); <p>to the church of Smyrna: <p>He that overcometh shall not be hurt in the second death (<a href="3927/revelation_2_11.htm">Revelation 2:11</a>); <p>to the church in Pergamos: <p>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna (<a href="3927/revelation_2_17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>); <p>to the church in Thyatira: <p>He that overcometh, to him will I give power over the nations (<a href="3927/revelation_2_26.htm">Revelation 2:26</a>); <p>to the church in Sardis: <p>He that overcometh shall be clothed in white garments (<a href="3927/revelation_3_5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>); <p>to the church in Philadelphia: <p>He that overcometh I will make him a pillar in the temple of God (<a href="3927/revelation_3_12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>); <p>and to the church of the Laodiceans: <p>He that overcometh I will give to him to sit with Me in My throne (<a href="3927/revelation_3_21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>). <p>Finally it may be added that so far as man is regenerated, or so far as regeneration is perfected in him, so far he attributes nothing of good and truth, that is, of charity and faith, to him self, but to the Lord only; for the truths which he gradually acquires teach this clearly. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #610 (Dick, 1950)
</h4>
<p>
610. Moreover, man's regeneration is not effected in a moment, but takes place gradually from the beginning to the end of his life in the world, and after this it is continued and perfected. As he is reformed by combats and victories over the evils of the flesh, the Son of Man says to each of the seven Churches, that He will bestow gifts on him that overcometh; as to the Church of Ephesus,<p>"To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life" <a href="3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>;<p>to the Church of Smyma,<p>"He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death" <a href="3927/revelation_2_11.htm">Revelation 2:11</a>;<p>to the Church in Pergamos,<p>"To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna" <a href="3927/revelation_2_17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>;<p>to the Church in Thyatira,<p>"To him that overcometh will I give power over the nations" <a href="3927/revelation_2_26.htm">Revelation 2:26</a>;<p>to the Church in Sardis,<p>"He that overcometh... shall be clothed in white raiment" <a href="3927/revelation_3_12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>;<p>to the Church in Philadelphia,<p>"Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God" <a href="3927/revelation_3_12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>;<p>to the Church of the Laodiceans,<p>"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne" <a href="3927/revelation_3_21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>.<p>Lastly, this may be added, that as far as a man is regenerated, or as far as regeneration is perfected in him, he attributes nothing of good and truth, that is, of charity and faith to himself, but to the Lord; for the truths which he successively acquires plainly teach this. </p>

610. Supradictis adjicietur hoc; quod Regeneratio hominis non fiat uno momento, sed quod successive a principio ad finem vitae in Mundo, et quod post hunc continuetur et perficiatur; et quia homo per pugnas et victorias super mala carnis suae reformatur, ideo dicit Filius hominis ad quamlibet e septem Ecclesiis, quod qui vicerit ei daturus sit dona; ut ad Ecclesiam Ephesinam, qui vicerit, dabo ut comedat de Arbore vitae, <a href="3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Apocalypsis 2:7</a>.
