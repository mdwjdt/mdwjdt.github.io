<p>
736. Next, the angel summoned the group of so-called wise people who considered heavenly joys, and the eternal happiness that results from them, to consist in the possession of great power and tremendous wealth, and the more-than-regal magnificence and shining splendor that come with them. (They based their view on statements in the Word to the effect that we are going to be kings and princes and reign with Christ to eternity and angels will minister to us, and many more things of that nature.)
<p>The angel said to them, "Follow me, and I will bring you into your joys. "
<p>He took them into a portico with pillars and obelisks. At the front of it there was a low entryway that led into the portico itself. The angel brought them through this entrance. They came upon [twenty men here and] twenty there who were waiting around. Suddenly an actor who was pretending to be an angel appeared and said to them, "This portico is the entrance to heaven itself. Stay here for a while and prepare yourselves, because the older among you are going to become kings and the younger are going to become princes. "
</p>
<p>
[2] After the actor said that, next to each pillar a throne appeared; a mantle of silk was laid out on it and a scepter and a crown were sitting on top of the mantle. Next to each obelisk a seat appeared that was raised about four and a half feet off the ground. On the seat there was a gold chain and a sash of the order of the knighthood, which was gathered and held at each end by a ring of diamonds.
<p>Then the supposed angel cried out, "Go now and put on this finery; then take your seats and wait. "
<p>The older men immediately ran to the thrones and the younger men to the seats. They put on their royal trappings and sat down. A dense fog rose up from below. As they breathed it in, their heads began to swell and they straightened up on their thrones and seats and came fully to believe that they were now kings and princes. That fog was the aura of the fantasy that now inspired them.
<p>Suddenly a number of young people appeared, flying down as if from heaven. Two of them took up positions behind each throne and one behind each seat in order to minister to the seated royalty.
<p>Then a herald periodically proclaimed, "You, O kings and princes, wait here a little longer. Your royal courts are now being prepared in heaven. Soon, courtiers and attendants will come to escort you there. " And they waited and waited until their spirits were exhausted and worn out by desire.
</p>
<p>
[3] After three hours heaven opened above their heads and angels looked down and felt sorry for them. The angels said, "Why are you sitting there like idiots and buffoons? These people played a trick on you and managed to turn you from people into statues. They were able to do this because you had taken it to heart that you were going to reign with Christ as kings and princes, and that angels would be ministering to you. Have you forgotten what the Lord said, that in heaven those who want to be great must be servants [<a href="3927/matthew_20_26.htm">Matthew 20:26-27</a>; ]?
<p>"You need to learn what 'kings' and 'princes' mean and what 'reigning with Christ' means. They mean becoming wise and performing a useful function. Christ's kingdom, which is heaven, is a kingdom of useful functions. The Lord loves everyone, and wants us all to have what is good. What is good is being useful. Because the Lord does good and useful things indirectly, here through angels and in the world through people, he gives those who are performing useful functions a love for being useful, and also a reward for being useful, which is inner bliss; and this inner bliss is eternal happiness.
</p>
<p>
[4] "As there is on earth, in heaven as well there is great power and tremendous wealth. There are governments and governmental responsibilities; therefore there are positions of greater and lesser power and status. Those who occupy the top positions have courts and palaces that are of greater magnificence and splendor than the courts and palaces of emperors and monarchs on earth. Because of the sheer number of courtiers, ministers, and attendants, and the finery they all wear, these leaders are surrounded with honor and glory. The people who occupy these top positions, though, are selected from among those whose hearts are devoted to the well-being of all and who are not affected beyond their bodily senses by the grandeur and magnificence that surrounds them in order to establish authority.
<p>"Because it is crucial to the well-being of all that each person has some function in the community (and the community is in effect a body of the whole), and because all usefulness comes from the Lord and is carried out through the agency of angels and people as if they were acting on their own, clearly this is what it means to 'reign with the Lord. '"
<p>Upon hearing this statement from heaven, the supposed kings and princes came down from their thrones and seats and laid down their scepters, crowns, and mantles. The dense fog that held the aura of their fantasy receded from them, and a bright cloud enveloped them that held an aura of wisdom; it restored their minds to sanity. </p>

736. After this the angel called to himself the group of so-called wise men, who had regarded heavenly joys and everlasting happiness arising from these as consisting in surpassing dominions and the richest treasures, and in magnificence beyond the reach of kings and splendour beyond compare. This was because it is said in the Word that they are to be kings and princes, and to reign with Christ for ever, and angels are to wait upon them, and much more besides. The angel said to them: 'Follow me and I shall bring you into your imagined joys.' So he took them into an arcade built of columns and pyramids; in front was a low palace, and through this there was an open entrance to the arcade. He took them through this, and there they found (twenty people in one place and] <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
twenty in another, all waiting. Then an actor playing the part of an angel suddenly appeared and said to them: 'The way to heaven lies through this arcade. Wait a little while and prepare yourselves, because the elder of you are to be kings, the younger princes.'</p>
<p>
[2] When he said this, a throne appeared next to each column, and on the throne a robe of silk, and on the robe a sceptre and a crown; and next to each pyramid appeared a chair raised three cubits above the ground, and on the chair a chain with gold links, and sashes of knighthood with diamond-studded globes at their ends. Then the cry went up, 'Come now and dress yourselves, take your seats and wait.' At once the elders hurried to the thrones and the younger men to the chairs, put on their robes and sat down. Then what looked like a mist appeared coming up from below; and as a result of breathing this those who sat on the thrones and chairs had their faces begin to swell up, and their chests were puffed up, and they were filled with a confident belief that they were now kings and princes. The mist was the aura of delusion which inspired them. Then suddenly young men flew in as if from heaven and stood, two behind each throne and one behind each chair, to wait on them. Then it was repeatedly proclaimed by a herald: 'You kings and princes are to wait here a little longer. Your courts are now being made ready in heaven, and your courtiers and attendants will shortly be here to take you to them.' They kept on waiting and waiting, until their spirits began to gasp and tire through longing.</p>
<p>
[3] After three hours heaven was opened above their heads, and the angels looked down and pitied them. 'Why,' they said, 'do you sit like this looking foolish and playing at acting? They have made fools of you and changed you from human beings into dummies, because you believed in your hearts that you would reign with Christ as kings and princes, and that then angels would wait upon you. Have you forgotten the Lord's words, that he who would be great in heaven must become a servant? You must learn therefore what is meant by kings and princes and by reigning with Christ. This means being wise and performing services. For Christ's kingdom, which is heaven, is a kingdom of services. For the Lord loves all and so wishes to do good to all, and good is service. Since the Lord does good or performs services indirectly through angels, and in the world through people, He gives those who faithfully perform services a love of service and its reward, which is inward blessedness, and this is everlasting happiness.</p>
<p>
[4] 'There are in the heavens, as on earth, surpassing dominions and the richest treasures. For there are governments and forms of government, and therefore major and minor authorities and ranks. Those who hold the highest offices have palaces and council-chambers, the magnificence and splendour of which surpass those of the palaces and council-chambers of emperors and kings on earth; and the number of their courtiers, ministers and attendants, and the magnificent uniforms they wear, form for them an ambience of honour and glory. But these highest rulers are chosen from those whose heart is in the welfare of society, and only their bodily senses are concerned with the greatness of magnificence, in order to inspire obedience. Since the public weal demands that everyone should serve some purpose in the community as being the common body, and since all service comes from the Lord, and is performed by angels and by men as if of themselves, it is obvious that this is reigning with the Lord.'<p>On hearing this from heaven the people dressed up as kings and princes came down from their thrones and chairs, and threw away their sceptres, crowns and robes. The mist which brought the aura of delusion went away, and they were covered by a shining cloud containing an aura of wisdom, and this brought sanity back to their minds.<p>

<p>
736. The angel then called to him that company of so-called wise men who had placed heavenly joys and eternal happiness therefrom in the possession of supreme dominion and boundless wealth, and in more than royal magnificence and transcendent splendor, because it is said in the Word that the righteous should be kings and princes, and should reign with Christ forever, and be ministered unto by the angels; and so on. To these the angel said, "Follow me, and I will introduce you into your joys." And he led them into a portico constructed of columns and pyramids. In front of it was a low porch which formed the entrance to the portico; and through this he led them; and behold, twenty persons were seen there, and were waiting. And presently there came one who impersonated an angel, and said to them, "The way to heaven is through this portico; wait here a while and prepare yourselves, for the older among you are to be kings, and the younger princes."
</p>
<p>
[2] When he had said this a throne was seen near each column, and on it a robe of silk, and on the robe a scepter and crown; and near each pyramid a seat appeared raised three cubits from the ground; on each seat was a chain made of small links of gold, and scarfs of an order of knights fastened together at the ends with diamond rings. It was then proclaimed, "Go now and robe yourselves, take your seats, and wait." And instantly the older men ran to the thrones, and the younger to the seats, and robed themselves and sat down. Then a kind of mist appeared coming up from the lower regions, and as this drew near, the faces of those occupying the thrones and seats began to swell and their hearts to heave, and they were filled with the confidence that they were now kings and princes. That mist was the aura of hallucination by which they were inspired. And presently some youths flew to them as if from heaven, and stood two behind each throne, and one behind each seat, to serve them. Proclamation was then made in turn by a herald, "Ye kings and princes, wait yet a little while, your palaces in heaven are now being made ready; the courtiers will come soon with their lifeguards and lead you to them." They waited and waited until their spirits panted and grew weary with desire.
</p>
<p>
[3] After three hours the heaven above their heads was opened and angels looked down, and pitying them, said, "Why do you sit there so foolishly, acting like players? They have played tricks upon you and have changed you from men to images, because you have fixed it in your hearts that you were to reign with Christ like kings and princes, and that angels would then minister unto you. Have you forgotten the words of the Lord, that he who would be great in heaven must become a servant? Learn, then, that being kings and princes and reigning with Christ, means being wise and performing uses; for the kingdom of Christ, which is heaven, is a kingdom of uses, because the Lord loves all, and therefore wills good to all, and good is use. And as the Lord does what is good or useful mediately through angels, and in the world through men, so to those who faithfully perform uses, He gives the love of use and its reward, which is internal blessedness, and this is eternal happiness.
</p>
<p>
[4] In the heavens as on earth there are supreme dominions, and boundless wealth; for there are governments there, and forms of government, and therefore greater and lesser powers and dignities; and those who occupy the highest positions have palaces and courts, which surpass those of emperors and kings on earth in magnificence and splendor; and they are surrounded with honor and glory because of the number of courtiers, ministers, and attendants, and their splendid vestments. But those who are thus exalted are chosen from among those whose hearts are in the public welfare, while their bodily senses only are appealed to by the grandeur of magnificence for the fostering of obedience. And as it is a matter of public welfare that everyone should be of some use in society as in the common body, and as all use is from the Lord, and is effected through angels and men as if it were done by them, it is clear that this is reigning with the Lord." <p>When this had been heard from heaven, those who had impersonated the kings and princes descended from the thrones and seats and threw away their scepters, crowns, and robes; and the mist in which was the aura of hallucination departed from them, and a bright cloud overshadowed them, in which there was an aura of wisdom, and sanity was thereby restored to their minds. </p>

736. The angel next summoned the company of the wise, so they were called, who had supposed that heavenly joys and eternal happiness resulting from them consisted in all-embracing dominion and boundless wealth, in more than royal magnificence and dazzling splendor. For it is said in the Word that 'they should be kings and princes, that they should reign with Christ for ever, and that they should be ministered to by angels;' and more to the same effect. "Follow me," said the angel to them, "and I will introduce you into your joys;" and he led them into a portico constructed of pillars and pyramids. In front of this was an unpretentious palace, through which lay the entrance to the portico. Through this he led them, and there they saw about twenty people who were waiting. Suddenly there appeared one who personated an angel, and he said to them: "The way to heaven is through this portico. Wait awhile, and prepare yourselves, for the older among you are to be kings, and the younger, princes."</p>
<p>
[2] When he had said this, there appeared near each pillar a throne on which was a silken robe and on the robe a sceptre and crown; while near each pyramid there appeared a chair of state, raised three cubits from the ground, on which were a chain of little golden links and a belt of the order of knighthood, fastened at the ends with diamond buckles. Then a voice was heard, saying, "Go now, put on your robes, be seated and wait." Instantly the older men ran to the thrones, and the younger to the chairs; and putting on their robes, they seated themselves. Then there appeared as it were a mist rising from below; and when those who were seated on the thrones and chairs inhaled it, they began to be puffed up and confidently assured that they were now kings and princes. This mist was an exhalation of the delusion by which they were obsessed. Thereupon pages flew down to them, as it were from heaven; and two stood behind each throne, and one behind each chair, ready to serve. Then at intervals proclamation was made by a herald: "Ye kings and princes, wait a little while; your palaces in heaven are now being made ready. Very soon your courtiers with escorts will come and introduce you." They waited and waited till their spirits dropped, and they grew weary with their longing.</p> 
<p>
[3] After three hours the heaven was opened above their heads, and angels, looking down on them in pity, said, "Why do you sit there, deluding yourselves in this way, and acting parts that do not belong to you? They have made a mockery of you, turning you from men into images, because you have set your hearts on the fond hope that you are to reign with Christ as kings and princes, and that angels are to minister to you. Have you forgotten the Lord's words, that in heaven he who would be great must become a servant? Learn, therefore, what is meant by being kings and princes, and by reigning with Christ; it is to be wise and to perform uses. The kingdom of Christ, which is heaven, is a kingdom of uses. The Lord loves all, and so wills good to all, and good is the same thing as use. As the Lord does good, or performs uses, through the instrumentality of angels, and, in the world, of men, therefore, to those who faithfully perform uses He communicates the love of use, together with its reward, internal blessedness; and this is eternal happiness.</p>
<p>
[4] "There are in the heavens, as on earth, all-embracing dominions and boundless wealth; for there are governments under various forms, and, therefore, powers and dignities greater and less. Those in the highest stations have palaces and courts which, for magnificence and splendor, surpass those of emperors and kings on earth; and they derive honor and glory from the number of their courtiers, ministers and attendants and the splendor of their uniforms. The heads of the state are chosen from those whose hearts are in the public welfare, and who are only externally gratified by lavish magnificence because of the spirit of obedience which it instils. Since the public welfare requires that every one should be of some use in society, as in a common body; and since all use is from the Lord, and is performed by angels and men as of themselves, it is evident that this is what is meant by reigning with the Lord."<p>On hearing these words from heaven, those who were personating kings and princes descended from their thrones and chairs, casting away their sceptres, crowns and robes. The mist in which was an exhalation of delusion, was dispersed, and there encompassed them a bright cloud in which was an atmosphere of wisdom; and thus sanity was restored to their minds. </p>

736. Post haec ad se vocavit Cohortem Sapientum ita dictorum, qui Gaudia coelestia, et ex his Felicitatem aeternam, in supereminentibus Dominiis, ac opulentissimis Gazis, inque superregia magnificentia, et super-illustri splendore, posuerant, ex causa, quia in Verbo dicitur, quod futuri sint reges et principes, et quod regnaturi sint cum Christo in aeternum, et quod ministrandi sint ab Angelis, praeter plura: Angelus ad hos dixit, sequimini, et introducam vos in vestra gaudia; <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
et introduxit in Porticum constructum ex Columnis et Pyramidibus: antrorsum erat humile Palatium, per quod patuit ingressus in Porticum; per hoc introduxit illos; et ecce visi sunt [viginti hic et] <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
viginti ibi, et exspectabant: et subito tunc aderat quidam personatus Angelus, et dixit illis, per hunc Porticum est via ad Coelum; manete aliquantisper, et praeparate vos, quia majorennes ex vobis futuri sunt Reges, ac minorennes futuri Principes.</p>
<p>
[2] His dictis, juxta quamlibet Columnam apparuit Thronus, et super throno chlamys ex serico, et super chlamyde sceptrum et corona; et juxta quamlibet Pyramidem apparuit Solium tres cubitos a terra elevatum, et super solio catena ex unculis auri, et equestris ordinis fasciae, colligatae ad fines adamantinis orbiculis. Et tunc clamatum est, ite nunc, amicite vos, sedete et exspectate: et actutum Majorennes accurrebant ad thronos, et Minorennes ad solia, et amiciverunt se, et reposuerunt se: at tunc apparuit sicut nimbus ex inferis ascendens, ex quo attracto sedentes super thronis et soliis coeperunt tumescere facie, et elevari pectore, et impleri fiducia, quod nunc reges et principes sint; nimbus ille erat aura phantasiae, qua inspirati sunt: et subito advolarunt juvenes sicut ex Coelo, et constiterunt duo post quemlibet thronum, et unus post quodlibet solium, ministraturi; et tunc per vices a quodam praecone acclamatum est, vos reges et principes, exspectate <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>

[3] Post trihorium aperiebatur Coelum supra caput illorum, et despexerunt Angeli, et miserti illorum, dixerunt, quare sedetis ita fatui, et agitis histriones; luserunt ludibria vobiscum, et ab hominibus mutaverunt vos in idola, ex causa quia induxistis in corda vestra, quod regnaturi sitis cum Christo sicut reges et principes, et quod vobis tunc Angeli ministraturi sint: num obliti estis verborum Domini, quod in Coelo qui vult magnus esse, fiat servus: discite ergo, quid per reges et principes, et quid per regnare cum Christo, intelligitur, quod sit sapere et facere usus; Regnum enim Christi, quod est Coelum, est Regnum usuum; nam Dominus amat omnes, ac inde vult omnibus bonum, ac bonum est usus, et quia Dominus bona seu usus facit mediate per angelos, et in Mundo per homines, ideo illis, qui fideliter usus faciunt, dat amorem usus, et ejus mercedem, quae est beatitudo interna, et haec est felicitas aeterna.</p>

[4] Sunt in Coelis, sicut in terris, supereminentia Dominia, et opulentissimae Gazae; sunt enim regimina et regiminum formae, et ideo sunt majores et minores potestates et dignitates; et illis qui in supremis sunt, sunt Palatia et Curiae, quae magnificentia et splendore excedunt palatia et curias Imperatorum et Regum in terris, et ex numero aulicorum, ministrorum, et satellitum, et ex horum magnificis investimentis, circumfluit illos honor et gloria: sed Supremi illi sunt electi ex illis, quorum cor est in salute publica, et solum sensus corporis in amplitudine magnificentiae propter obedientiam: et quia salutis publicae est, ut quisque sit aliquis usus in societate, ut in communi corpore, et quia omnis usus est a Domino, et fit per angelos et per homines sicut ab illis, patet quod hoc sit regnare cum Domino. His auditis e Coelo, personati illi reges et principes descenderunt e thronis et soliis, et abjecerunt sceptra, coronas, et chlamydes; et recessit ab illis nimbus, in quo fuit aura phantasiae, et obvelavit illos nubes candida, in qua erat aura sapientiae, ex qua rediit sanitas mentibus illorum.<p>
