772. The Purpose of This Coming of the Lord - His Second Coming - Is to Separate the Evil from the Good, to Save Those Both Past and Present Who Believe in Him, and to Form Them into a New Angelic Heaven and a New Church on Earth; If He Did Not Do This, "No Flesh Would Be Saved" (<a href="3927/matthew_24_22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>)
<p>The purpose of the Lord's Second Coming is not to destroy the visible heaven and the inhabitable earth, as the sections under the previous heading have shown [<a href="768.htm">768-771</a>]. The Lord's own words make it clear that the purpose of the new church is not to destroy anything but to build something; therefore it is not to condemn anyone but to save those people ever since his First Coming who have believed in him, and those in the future who are going to believe in him.
<p>God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world but to save the world through him. Those who believe in him are not judged; but those who do not believe have already been judged because they have not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. (<a href="3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17-18</a>)
<p>If any hear my words but do not believe, I do not judge them. I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. Those who despise me and do not accept my words already have something that judges them. The Word that I have spoken - that will judge them. (<a href="3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>)
<p>The Last Judgment occurred in the spiritual world in 1757. The small work titled Last Judgment (published in London in 1758) and Supplement to the Last Judgment (published in Amsterdam in 1763) made this information public. I testify that it is the truth. I saw it with my own eyes in a state of full wakefulness. </p>

772. VI. This, which is the Lord's second coming, is taking place in order that the wicked should be separated from the good, and those should be saved who believe in Him and have done so; and so that a new heaven of angels and a new church on earth should be formed from them. Without this no flesh could be saved (<a href="3927/matthew_24_22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>).<p>I showed in the preceding section that this, the Lord's second coming, is not taking place in order to wipe out the sky we see and the earth we live on. In fact it is not so as to destroy anything, but to build something; and so not to condemn, but to save those who from His first coming have believed in Him and who after this will believe in Him. This is established from these of the Lord's words:<p>God did not send His Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world should be saved through Him. He who believes in Him is not judged; but he who does not believe is already judged, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God, <a href="3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17-18</a>.<p>Elsewhere:<p>If anyone has heard my words, yet has not believed, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world. He who despises me and does not receive my words, has that which judges him. The word which I have spoken will judge him, <a href="3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>.<p>The Last Judgment took place in the spiritual world in 1757, as I revealed in my short book on THE LAST JUDGMENT (published at London in 1758), and further in the CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE LAST JUDGMENT (Amsterdam, 1763). I can bear witness to this, because I saw it with my own eyes while fully awake. </p>

772. VI. THIS COMING OF THE LORD WHICH IS HIS SECOND COMING, IS TAKING PLACE IN ORDER THAT THE EVIL MAY BE SEPARATED FROM THE GOOD, AND THAT THOSE WHO HAVE BELIEVED AND DO BELIEVE IN HIM, MAY BE SAVED, AND THAT FROM THEM A NEW ANGELIC HEAVEN AND A NEW CHURCH ON EARTH MAY BE FORMED; AND WITHOUT THIS, NO FLESH COULD BE SAVED (<a href="3927/matthew_24_22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>). <p>That this second coming of the Lord does not take place for the purpose of destroying the visible heaven and habitable earth, has been shown in the preceding section. That it is not for the purpose of destroying anything, but to build up, consequently not to condemn but to save those who since His first coming have believed in Him and also those who may hereafter believe in Him, is evident from these words of the Lord: <p>God sent not His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world through Him might be saved; he that believeth on Him is not judged, but he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God (<a href="3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17, 18</a>). <p>And elsewhere: <p>If any man hear My words and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world but to save the world: He that despiseth Me and receiveth not My words, hath one that judgeth him; the Word that I have spoken shall judge him in the last day (<a href="3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>). <p>That the last judgment took place in the spiritual world in the year 1757 has been shown in the little work on The Last Judgment (London, 1758); and further in a Continuation on the Last Judgment, (Amsterdam, 1763). To all this I can testify, because I saw it with my own eyes in a state of full wakefulness. </p>

772. VI. THIS COMING OF THE LORD, WHICH IS THE SECOND, TAKES PLACE IN ORDER THAT THE EVIL MAY BE SEPARATED FROM THE GOOD; AND THAT THOSE MAY BE SAVED WHO HAVE BELIEVED AND WHO NOW BELIEVE ON HIM; AND THAT FROM THESE THERE MAY BE FORMED A NEW ANGELIC HEAVEN AND A NEW CHURCH ON EARTH; AND WITHOUT THIS COMING NO FLESH COULD BE SAVED, <a href="3927/matthew_24_22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>.<p>It has been shown in the preceding article that this Second Coming of the Lord is not to destroy the visible heaven and the habitable earth. That its purpose is not to destroy anything but to build up, consequently not to condemn but to save those who, since His first Coming, have believed on Him, and those who will hereafter believe, is evident from these words of the Lord:<p>"God sent not His Son into the world to judge (A.V., condemn) the world; but that the world through Him might be saved. He that believeth on Him is not judged (A.V., condemned): but he that believeth not is judged (A.V., condemned) already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God" <a href="3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17-18</a>;<p>and elsewhere,<p>"If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the Word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him" <a href="3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>.<p>That the Last Judgment took place in the spiritual world in the year 1757, was shown in a little work on The Last Judgment, published in London in the year 1758; and also in The Continuation of the Last Judgment, published in Amsterdam in the year 1763. This I solemnly attest, because I saw it with my own eyes, in a state of full wakefulness. </p>
