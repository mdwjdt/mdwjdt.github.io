<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第164节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>164</b>. （1）圣三一是存在的，就是父、子和圣灵。圣三一，就是父、子、圣灵是存在的，这一点清楚可见于圣言，尤其以下经文：<br />天使迦百列对玛利亚说，圣灵要临到你身上，至高者的能力要荫庇你；因此你所要生的圣者必称为神的儿子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.35.htm">路加福音1:35</a>）<br />这里就提到这三者，即至高者，也就是父神，圣灵和神的儿子。又如：<br />耶稣受了洗，看哪，天开了，约翰就看见圣灵仿佛鸽子落在祂身上；看哪，从天上有声音说，这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.16.htm">马太福音3:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.10.htm">马可福音1:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.11.htm">11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.32.htm">约翰福音1:32</a>）<br />这一点在主对门徒所说的这些话中更明显：<br />你们要去，使列族作门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.19.htm">马太福音28:19</a>）<br />还可见于从约翰福音中的这些话：<br />天上作见证的有三：父，圣言或道（the Word），圣灵。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约壹5.7.htm">约翰一书5:7</a>）<br />此外，主向父祷告，谈论祂，与其对话，并说祂会差圣灵来，也差来了。最后，使徒在书信中经常提到父、子和圣灵。由此清楚可知，圣三一是存在的，就是父，子，圣灵。</p>

164. 現在, 這些觀點需要逐一詳解。
<p>(1)有聖三一, 就是父,子,聖靈。
<p>聖言中, 很明顯看出三一的存在, 就是父,子,聖靈。舉例說明:天人迦百列對瑪利亞說:"聖靈將降臨於你, 至高者的能力將遮蓋你, 因此從你生出的聖者將被稱為上帝的兒子"(<a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">路加福音1:35</a>)。這裡提到三:至高者(就是父上帝), 聖靈, 上帝之子。當耶穌受洗時, 天開了, 約翰看見聖靈仿佛鴿子降在祂身上; 有聲音從天上說:"這是我的愛子, 我所喜悅的"(<a href="3927/matthew_3_16.htm">馬太福音3:16-17</a>;<a href="3927/mark_1_10.htm">馬可福音1:10-11</a>;<a href="3927/john_1_32.htm">約翰福音1:32</a>)。
<p>主對門徒說的這句話更明顯:你們要去, 使萬民作我的門徒, 奉父,子,聖靈的名給他們施洗(<a href="3927/matthew_28_19.htm">馬太福音28:19</a>)。
<p>還可從約翰的話中明顯看到三一的存在:天上作見證的有三:父,道,聖靈。(<a href="3927/john_5_7.htm">約翰福音5:7</a>)
<p>除了這些經文, 還可從主所做的看出來:主向父禱告, 與父談話並說到父; 主說祂要差遣聖靈並且差了。還有, 在使徒們的書信中經常提到父,子,聖靈。從以上可清楚獲知, 有聖三一的存在, 就是父,子,聖靈。 </p>

164. 1. There is a divine Trinity, which is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is very obvious in the Word that there is a divine Trinity, which is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Take the following passages for example:
<p>The angel Gabriel said to Mary, "The Holy Spirit will descend upon you and the power of the Highest will cover you; therefore the Holy One that is born from you will be called the Son of God. " (<a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>)
<p>Here three are named: the Highest (who is God the Father), the Holy Spirit, and the Son of God.
<p>When Jesus was baptized, behold the heavens opened and John saw the Holy Spirit coming down like a dove upon him; and a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. " (<a href="3927/matthew_3_16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_10.htm">Mark 1:10-11</a>; <a href="3927/john_1_32.htm">John 1:32</a>)
<p>The Trinity is even more obvious from the Lord's words to his disciples:
<p>Go out and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. (<a href="3927/matthew_28_19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>)
<p>The Trinity is also obvious from these words in John:
<p>There are three who testify in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit. (<a href="3927/1-john_5_7.htm">1 John 5:7</a>)
<p>Further evidence besides these passages is that the Lord prayed to his Father and spoke about him and with him; and he said that he was going to send and had sent the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, in their letters the apostles frequently mention the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These sources clearly show that there is a divine Trinity, which is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. </p>

164. (i) THERE IS A DIVINE TRINITY CONSISTING OF FATHER, SON AND HOLY SPIRIT.<p>The existence of a Divine Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, is plainly demonstrated by the Word, especially the following passages:<p>The angel Gabriel said to Mary, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you, so that the holy thing that is born of you will be called the Son of God, <a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>.<p>Here all three are named: the Most High, who is God the Father, the Holy Spirit, and the Son of God.<p>When Jesus was baptised, behold, the heavens were opened, and John saw the Spirit of God <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
coming down like a dove, and alighting upon Him; and a voice from heaven saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, <a href="3927/matthew_3_16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_10.htm">Mark 1:10-11</a>; <a href="3927/john_1_32.htm">John 1:32</a>.<p>It is even clearer in the words which the Lord used to the disciples:<p>Go and make all nations disciples, baptising them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, <a href="3927/matthew_28_19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>.<p>Moreover in this passage of John:<p>Three there are that bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word and the Holy Spirit. <a href="3927/1-john_5_7.htm">1 John 5:7</a>.<p>In addition there is the fact that the Lord prayed to His Father, and spoke about Him and with Him, saying that He would send the Holy Spirit, and this too He did. Moreover, the Apostles frequently named in their Epistles the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. These passages show plainly that there is a Divine Trinity consisting of Father, Son and Holy Spirit.<p>

164. (1) There is a Divine Trinity, which is Father, Son and Holy Spirit. That there is a Divine trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is made clearly evident in the Word, as in the following passages: <p>The angel Gabriel said to Mary, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee therefore that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God (<a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>).  <p>Here three are mentioned, the Most High, who is God the Father, the Holy Spirit, and the Son of God: <p>When Jesus was baptized, Lo, the heavens were opened, and John saw the Holy Spirit descending as a dove and coming upon Him and lo, a voice out of heaven saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased (<a href="3927/matthew_3_16.htm">Matthew 3:16, 17</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_10.htm">Mark 1:10, 11</a>; <a href="3927/john_1_32.htm">John 1:32</a>). <p>And still more plainly in these words of the Lord to His disciples: <p>Go ye and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit (<a href="3927/matthew_28_19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>); <p>and still again in these words in John: <p>There are three that bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit (<a href="3927/1-john_5_7.htm">1 John 5:7</a>). <p>Furthermore, the Lord prayed to His Father, and spoke of Him and with Him, and said that He would send the Holy Spirit, and He did send it. Finally the apostles in their Epistles frequently mentioned the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. From all this it is clear that there is a Divine trinity, which is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. </p>
