844. 比起其他人, 犹太人更不知自己现身在灵界, 还以为他们仍在尘世。 这是因为他们完全是外在人, 没有对宗教进行深入思考。 结果, 他们象先前一样, 还在谈论弥赛亚。 有些人说, 祂会与大卫一同降临, 戴着闪光的王冠来到他们面前, 领他们进入迦南地; 在路上, 祂会举起权杖, 令他们要穿越的河流干涸, 那时基督徒 (他们互称外邦人) 会拉住他们的衣襟, 哀告乞怜, 恳求与他们同去; 而他们会根据财富多寡接受富人, 这些人也必作他们的仆人。 他们执着于这样的信念, 对此, 可见于<a href="3927/zechariah_8_23.htm">撒迦利亚书8:23</a>,和<a href="3927/isaiah_66_20.htm">以赛亚书66:20</a>, 以及大卫的话, 还有 (<a href="3927/jeremiah_30_9.htm">耶利米书30:9</a>;<a href="3927/ezekiel_34_23.htm">以西结书34:23-25</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_23.htm">37:23-26</a>) 中: 祂必来作他们的王和牧人。 他们最不想听的话就是, “大卫”指的是主耶稣基督, 而“犹太人”则指那些属祂教会的人。 </p>

844. More than others, Jews are unaware that they are in the spiritual world; they think they are still in the physical world. The reason for this is that they are thoroughly external people who do not think about religion in an inward way. Therefore they still say the same things about the Messiah that they used to say in the world.
<p>Some say the Messiah is going to come with David and, glittering with gems, will go before the Jewish people and bring them into the land of Canaan. Along the way he will lift his rod and dry up the rivers they will cross. Christians (in private communication Jews refer to them as gentiles) will seize the hems of their garments, begging to be allowed to come with them. Others who are rich enough will also be allowed to join them as their servants.
<p>They convince themselves that this is how it will be because of <a href="3927/zechariah_8_23.htm">Zechariah 8:23</a> and <a href="3927/isaiah_66_20.htm">Isaiah 66:20</a>, and because of the statements in <a href="3927/jeremiah_30_9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a> and <a href="3927/ezekiel_34_23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23-25</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_23.htm">37:23-26</a> that David will come and be their king and shepherd. They are not at all open to hearing that David in these passages means our Lord Jesus Christ and that Jews here mean people who will belong to the Lord's church. </p>

844. The Jews are especially notable for failing to know that they are in the spiritual world, believing themselves still to be in the natural world. The reason is that they are utterly external people, having no inward thoughts about religion. They therefore speak in the same way about the Messiah as they did previously. Some say that he will come with David and glittering with jewels will go before them, leading them into the land of Canaan, drying up rivers for them to cross by raising his rod. They say that the Christians, whom among themselves they actually call gentiles, will then catch hold of the skirts of their clothes, humbly begging to be allowed to accompany them; and they will accept the rich if they are well enough off, and these too will be their servants. They support this belief by what is said in Zechariah (<a href="3927/zechariah_8_23.htm">Zechariah 8:23</a>) and in Isaiah (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_20.htm">Isaiah 66:20</a>). On the coming of David to be their king and shepherd they quote Jeremiah (<a href="3927/jeremiah_30_9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="3927/ezekiel_34_23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23-25</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_23.htm">37:23-26</a>). They are utterly unwilling to be told that David there means our Lord Jesus Christ, and that the Jews there mean those who are going to belong to His church. </p>

844. The Jews more than others are unaware that they are the spiritual world, believing that they are still in the natural world. This is because they are wholly external men and give no interior thought to any religious subject. Consequently, they continue to talk about the Messiah as before, some saying that He is to come with David, and glittering with diadems will go before them and lead them into the land of Canaan; and on the way will dry up the rivers they are to cross by raising His staff, and that Christians (whom among themselves they also call Gentiles) will then take hold of the skirts of their garments, suppliantly beseeching permission to go with them; that they will accept the rich according to the amount of their wealth, and that these also shall serve them. In this belief they confirm themselves by what is written in Zechariah (<a href="3927/zechariah_8_23.htm">8:23</a>); and in Isaiah (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_20.htm">66:20</a>); also by what is said of David, that he is to come and be their king and shepherd (<a href="3927/jeremiah_30_9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_34_23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23-25</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_23.htm">37:23-26</a>). They are utterly unwilling to hear that by "David" our Lord Jesus Christ is there meant and by "the Jews" those who will belong to His church. </p>

844. The Jews are less aware than others that they are in the spiritual world, but consider that they are still in the natural world. This is because they are altogether external men, and have no interior conception of religion. Hence they talk about the Messiah as they did before. Some say that He will come with David, and, resplendent with diadems, will go before them and lead them into the land of Canaan; and that on the way, by raising His rod, He will cause rivers to dry up for them to cross that Christians, whom also among themselves they call Gentiles, will then take hold of the skirts of their garments, humbly praying to be permitted to accompany them; and that they will receive the rich according to their wealth and be served by them. They confirm themselves in these ideas by what is written in <a href="3927/zechariah_8_23.htm">Zechariah 8:23</a>; and in <a href="3927/isaiah_66_20.htm">Isaiah 66:20</a>; and by what is written concerning David, that he is to come and be their king and shepherd, in <a href="3927/jeremiah_30_9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a>, and in <a href="3927/ezekiel_34_23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23-25</a>, and in chapter <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_23.htm">Ezekiel 37:23-26</a>; for they are altogether unwilling to hear that our Lord Jesus Christ is meant by David in these passages, and that by Jews are meant those who will belong to His Church. </p>

844. Judaei prae aliis non sciunt quod in Mundo spirituali sint, sed credunt se adhuc in Mundo naturali esse; causa est, quia prorsus Externi homines sunt, et non aliquid de Religione cogitant ex interiori: quare etiam loquuntur similiter de Messia sicut prius, et quidam quod venturus sit cum Davide, et fulgens diadematibus praeiturus illis, ac introducturus illos in Terram Canaanem, et in via elevatione Baculi exsiccaturus fluvios quos transibunt, et quod Christiani, quos inter se etiam Gentes vocant, tunc alas vestium illorum arrepturi, suppliciter orantes ut liceat comitari, et quod recepturi Divites secundum copias, et quod hi quoque illis servituri sint: in his confirmant se per illa quae leguntur apud <a href="3927/zechariah_8_23.htm">Sachariam 8:23</a>, et apud <a href="3927/isaiah_66_20.htm">Esajam 66:20</a>: et de Davide, quod venturus sit, et futurus illorum Rex et Pastor, ex <a href="3927/jeremiah_30_9.htm">Jeremia 30:9</a>, exque <a href="3927/ezekiel_34_23.htm">Ezechiele 34:23-25</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_23.htm">37:23-26</a>, prorsus non volentes audire, quod per Davidem ibi intelligatur Dominus noster Jesus Christus; et quod per Judaeos ibi intelligantur illi qui ab Ecclesia Ipsius erunt. </p>
