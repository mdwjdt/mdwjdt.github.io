534. People who do not examine themselves are like people with a sickness that closes off their capillaries and therefore corrupts their blood, causing their limbs to go to sleep and atrophy, and resulting in severe chronic diseases because their humors, and therefore the blood that arises from them, are viscous, sticky, irritating, and acidic. People who do examine themselves, however, including the intentions of their will, are like people who are healed from these diseases and regain the vitality they felt when they were young.
<p>People who examine themselves in the right way are like ships from Ophir completely filled with gold, silver, and precious stones; before they examined themselves, though, they were like barges loaded down with unclean freight, carting away the filth and excrement from city streets.
<p>People who examine themselves deeply become like mines, whose walls all shine with ores of precious metals; before they do so, however, they are like foul-smelling swamps inhabited by serpents and poisonous snakes with glittering scales, and harmful insects with shiny wings.
<p>People who do not examine themselves are like the dry bones in the valley; but after people have explored themselves they become like those same bones after the Lord Jehovih put sinews on them, brought flesh upon them, covered them with skin, and breathed spirit into them, and they came to life (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1-14</a>). </p>

534. Those who do not examine themselves are, to use a simile, like sick people whose blood is corrupted by the blockage of the smallest blood-vessels. This leads to atrophy, sluggishness of the limbs and severe chronic illnesses due to the viscosity, stickiness, pungency and acidity of the humours, and thus of the blood. On the other hand, those whose self-examination includes also the intentions of the will resemble those who are cured of such illnesses and recapture the vitality they had when young. Those who examine themselves properly are like ships from Ophir full-laden with gold, silver and precious goods; but before self-examination like ships loaded with refuse, used to carry away the mud and dung of the streets. Those who examine themselves inwardly become like mines with all their faces gleaming with ores containing noble metals; but before they are like stinking swamps full of snakes and poisonous serpents with glittering scales, and of nasty insects with shining wings. Those who do not examine themselves are like dry bones in a valley; but after self-examination like the same bones which the Lord Jehovih endowed with sinews, made flesh grow on them and covered with skin, giving them breath so that they might live (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1-14</a>). </p>

534. Those who do not examine themselves, are comparatively like invalids whose blood is vitiated by the closing of the capillary vessels, which causes atrophy, numbness of the limbs, and painful chronic diseases arising from a thickening, tenacity, acridness, and acidity of the humors, and consequently of the blood. But on the other hand, those who examine themselves even as to the intentions of the will, are like those who have been cured of these diseases, and restored to the life they enjoyed in youth. Those who examine themselves properly, are like ships from Ophir laden with gold, silver, and valuables; but before they have examined themselves they are like ships loaded with filth, such as are used to carry off the mud and ordure of the streets. Those who examine themselves interiorly become like mines, all the walls of which are resplendent with ores of precious metals; but before this, they are like marshes with foul exhalations, containing snakes and poisonous serpents with glittering skins and noxious insects with shining wings. Those who do not examine themselves are like the dry bones in the valley; but after they have examined themselves, they are like these same bones when the Lord Jehovah had laid sinews upon them, caused flesh to come upon them, covered them with skin, and put breath in them, and they lived (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1-14</a>). </p>

534. Those who do not examine themselves may be compared to sick people, whose blood has become corrupt from some obstruction in the very fine vessels. This causes atrophy, numbness of the limbs, and acute chronic disorders, occasioned by the thickness, tenacity, acrimony and acidity of the humors, and consequently of the blood. On the other hand, those who examine themselves, even as to the intentions of the will, are like those who are cured of such diseases and restored to the life they enjoyed in their youth. Those who rightly examine themselves are like ships from Ophir, laden with gold, silver and precious merchandise; but before examining themselves they are like ships laden with all manner of rubbish and filth swept up from the streets. Those who interiorly examine themselves are like mines whose walls gleam with the ores of precious metals; but before examination they are like foul marshes, in which are snakes and poisonous serpents with shining scales, and noxious insects with glittering wings. Those who do not examine themselves are like the dry bones in the valley; but after examination they are like the same bones, upon which the Lord JEHOVIH laid sinews and brought up flesh; and He also covered them with skin, and put breath into them, and they lived, <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1-14</a>. </p>

ac morbi acuti Chronici, ex spissitudine, tenacitate, acrimonia et aciditate humorum, et inde sanguinis oriundi; at vero illi qui explorant se etiam quoad intentiones Voluntatis, in similitudine sunt sicut illi, qui a morbis illis sanati sunt, et redeunt in vitam, in qua fuerunt dum juvenes. Illi qui rite explorant se, sunt sicut naves ex Ophiro, auro, argento et pretiosis refertae, at antequam exploraverunt se, sunt sicut naves onustae immundis, quibus exportantur platearum coena et stercora. Illi qui interius explorant se, fiunt sicut fodinae, quarum omnes parietes splendent mineris nobilis metalli; prius autem sicut paludes nidorosae, in quibus sunt colubri <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
et serpentes venenati, qui coruscant squamis, et insecta noxia quae nitent alis. Illi qui non explorant se, sunt sicut Ossa arida in valle, at postquam exploraverunt se, sunt sicut eadem ossa, super quae Dominus Jehovih dedit nervos, ascendere fecit carnem, quae obduxit cute, et in quae dedit spiritum, et vixerunt, <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_1.htm">Ezechiel 37:1-14</a>. <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
