745. When the angel's group returned to their rooms, what the prince had just ordered was done. People from the city arrived who had been summoned to entertain the guests with conversation about the various modes of recreation in that community. After they met and greeted the newcomers, they all went for a walk together, enjoying a good conversation.
<p>The angel guide then said [to the people from the city], "These ten people were invited to this heaven to see the nature of our joys here and to develop a new concept of eternal happiness. Tell them, if you would, some of the activities here that are rejuvenating for our bodily senses. Later on, we will be visiting with wise people, who are to inform them of some of the inward qualities that make these modes of recreation truly happy and joyful. "
<p>In response to this the people from the city provided the following examples.
<p>"First: There are festival days here, which are scheduled by the prince in order to relieve our minds of the stress and fatigue that tends to affect us if we become overly competitive. On festival days there is music and singing in the streets, and there are sporting events and shows outside the city. In the public squares stages are set up, framed by screens of latticework that have grapevines interwoven in them and bunches of grapes hanging down. Between these the musicians sit on three tiers. They have all kinds of stringed instruments and wind instruments that cover the spectrum from treble to bass, with timbres ranging from soft to sharp. On either side of the musicians there are male and female vocalists, who entertain the audience with excellent songs and praises, in solos and as a choir. Now and then during the performance they will shift to a different type of music. On festival days, entertainments like this will start early and go all morning; then after a break for lunch they will continue through the afternoon into the evening.
</p>
<p>
[2] "Second: As another example, every morning from the houses around the public squares you hear girls and young women singing songs of great sweetness. The sound fills the entire city. Each morning the song embodies one particular feeling related to spiritual love. That is, the way the voices sound and the mode the song is in convey a given feeling so well that we experience the song as that feeling itself. The song flows into our souls as we listen and stirs in us the feeling it corresponds to. This is the nature of songs in heaven. The singers tell us that as those listening become more receptive, the sound of the song becomes more inspired, inwardly alive, and beautiful.
<p>"When the song is over, the windows of the houses around the central square and also on the side streets are closed, and then so are the doors. Silence fills the entire city. No noise is heard anywhere, and no one is seen out of doors. All are then focused on doing the work that their jobs entail.
</p>
<p>
[3] "Third: At midday the doors are opened. A little later, some of the windows are opened as well. Then you see boys and girls playing in the streets, under the supervision of their caregivers and teachers, who sit on the porches of their houses.
</p>
<p>
[4] "Fourth: On the outskirts of the city there are various sporting activities for teenagers and young adults. There are games that involve a lot of running, games with balls, games with rackets. There are also contests in the arena for teenagers in order to see who is quicker or slower at speaking, taking action, and perceiving. Those who are quicker are awarded a laurel wreath as their prize. There are also many other activities designed to bring out the young people's hidden talents.
</p>
<p>
[5] "Fifth: For yet another example, outside the city comedies are performed on stage. The players in them represent the various honorable and virtuous attitudes that go to make up a moral life. For the sake of contrast, some of the actors will play buffoons. "
<p>At this point one of the ten newcomers asked, "Why for contrast?"
<p>"No virtue, or the honorable and appropriate actions that go with it, can be brought out in a living way without showing different levels of it from greatest to least. The buffoons represent the least level of that moral quality, just on the edge of no morality at all. It is actually forbidden by law, however, to portray the opposite of that moral quality - to depict behavior that is blatantly dishonorable or shows bad taste; that can only be implied or shown in some remote and indirect way. The reason for this prohibition is that there is no continuum that includes both behavior that is honorable and good, arising out of some virtue, and behavior that is dishonorable and evil. What is good and honorable diminishes to the least amount of it, and then comes to an end. Its opposite only starts up beyond the point at which that virtue has completely ceased to exist. Therefore heaven, where all things are honorable and good, has absolutely nothing in common with hell, where all things are dishonorable and evil. " </p>

745. When they got back, this was done. Those who had been called in to entertain them by talking about the community's varied joys arrived from the town. After greeting them they engaged in polite conversation as they walked together. The angel guide told them that these ten men had been invited to this heaven to see its joys, and so to form a new idea of everlasting happiness. 'So tell them,' he said, 'something about its joys which affect the bodily senses. Later on the wise men will come to tell them some things that turn these joys into bliss and happiness.'<p>On hearing this the people sent from the town told them the following: 'There are here holidays proclaimed by the prince to give mental relaxation from the weariness which some feel as the result of longing not to be outdone. On these days there are concerts of music and singing in the squares, and outside the town sports and theatrical performances. At this time the squares are equipped with galleries surrounded by balustrades of interwoven vines, from which hang bunches of grapes. Amongst these, musicians sit in three tiers with string and wind instruments, some high and some low-pitched, some loud and some gentle-sounding, with at either side singers of either sex. These entertain the citizens with the most delightful hymns and songs, either in choirs or as solos, varying the genre from time to time. On holidays these performances last from morning till noon, and then through the afternoon till evening.</p>
<p>
[2] (2) In addition, every morning there are to be heard coming from the houses round the squares the sweetest singing by maidens and girls', which echoes all through the town. There is one affection of spiritual love which is the subject of a daily song. That is to say, the affection is to be heard in the variations and modulations of the singing voice, and it is felt in the singing as if it were actually present. It flows into the souls of the audience, and rouses them to corresponding feelings. Such is the nature of singing in heaven. These singers say that the sound of their singing as it were inspires them and excites them inwardly, making them pleasurably uplifted, in proportion to the reactions of their listeners. When this is over, the windows and doors of the houses in the squares and streets are shut, and there is silence throughout the town, nor is there noise to be heard anywhere, nor are people to be seen wandering about. All then apply themselves to performing the task of their occupations.</p>
<p>
[3] (3) But at noon the doors are opened, and in the afternoon the windows too in some places, so that they can watch the boys and girls playing in the streets under the eyes of their nurses and masters, who sit in the porches of the houses.</p>
<p>
[4] (4) At the outermost edges of the town there are fields for various sports for boys and youths. There are races and games played with balls. There are games played with balls bouncing off walls, what is called rackets. There are competitions among the boys to see who is more and who less energetic in speaking, acting and seizing the point. The more energetic get a few laurel leaves as their prize. There are many other sports intended to develop latent skills in the boys.</p>
<p>
[5] (5) In addition, there are actors who put on performances in theatres outside the town. These display the various kinds of honourable and virtuous action which take place in civilised society. There are some among them who are actors who show contrasts.' 'What do you mean,' said one of the ten, 'by showing contrasts?' 'No virtue,' they replied, 'can be vividly displayed with all its fine and proper sentiments, except by contrasts between degrees of virtue varying from maximum to minimum. These actors portray the minimum of virtues, until they become zero. But there is a firm rule that they are not to show anything of their opposites, what are called dishonourable and improper actions, except figuratively and as it were seen from a long way off. The reason this rule is laid down is that nothing decent and good in any virtue can by successive steps change into what is indecent and evil; but it decreases more and more until it ceases to exist, and at that point the opposite begins. Heaven, therefore, where everything is decent and good, has nothing in common with hell, where everything is indecent and evil.' </p>

745. When they had returned to their apartments this was done. Men invited from the city came to entertain them with conversation on the various joys of the society; and after the usual greetings they conversed with them agreeably, as they walked. But their angelic guide said, "These ten men have been invited into this heaven to behold its joys, and thereby to acquire a new idea of eternal happiness. Recount to them, therefore, some of its joys which affect the bodily senses; afterwards some wise men are to come who will mention some of the things that render those joys satisfactory and delightful." <p>Hearing this, the men invited from the city mentioned the following: (1) There are days of festivity appointed here by the prince, to relieve the mind of the fatigue which the passion of emulation may have brought upon some. On these days there are musical and vocal concerts in the public squares, and outside of the city there are games and shows; music stands are also raised in the public squares, surrounded by lattice-work of interwoven vines, from which hang clusters of grapes; while within this lattice-work, on three rows of seats, one above another, sit musicians with stringed and wind instruments, high-toned and low-toned, some powerful and some sweet; and at the sides are singers of both sexes, delighting the citizens with the sweetest jubilees and songs, choruses and solos, varied in character at intervals. On these days of festivity all this is continued from morning until noon, and then again until evening.
</p>
<p>
[2] (2) Moreover, every morning there are heard from the houses about the squares the sweetest songs of girls and maidens, with which the whole city resounds. Each morning some one affection of spiritual love is sung, that is, is expressed by modifications or modulations of the voice in singing, and that affection is perceptible in the singing as if it were the affection itself. It flows into the souls of the hearers, and stirs them to a correspondence with it. Such is heavenly singing. The singers say that the sound of their song inspires and animates them from within, as it were, and exalts them with joy in the measure of its reception by their hearers. When the singing ceases, the windows of the houses on the squares are closed, and also those of the houses on the streets, and the doors also, and then the whole city is silent; there is no noise anywhere, and no wandering idlers are seen; all thus prepared then enter upon the duties of their employments.
</p>
<p>
[3] (3) At noon the doors are opened, and in the afternoon in some places the windows also, and the boys and girls are seen playing in the streets, their nurses and teachers sitting in the porches of the houses keeping watch over them.
</p>
<p>
[4] (4) In the outskirts of the city, there are various games of boys and young men; there are foot-races and games of ball, and what is called tennis, with the balls struck back and forth; there are public contests among the boys to determine who is the quicker and who the slower in speaking, acting, and understanding; and to the quicker some laurel leaves are given as a reward, with many other methods of calling out the latent abilities of the boys.
</p>
<p>
[5] (5) And again, outside the city there are theatrical exhibitions, where players represent the various proprieties and virtues of moral life; with players among them of lower parts for the sake of what is relative." <p>One of the ten asked, "Why for the sake of what is relative?" <p>They replied, "No virtue with its proprieties and graces can be presented in a living way except by an exhibition of what is relative from its greatest to its least phases. These players represent the least phases even till they become none. But it is provided by law that nothing opposite, which is called improper and unbecoming, shall be exhibited, except figuratively and as it were remotely. It is so provided, because nothing that is proper and good in any virtue can pass by successive steps to what is improper and evil, but only to its least phase until it perishes; and when it perishes the opposite begins. Therefore, heaven, where all things are proper and good, has nothing in common with hell, where all things are improper and evil." </p>

745. The prince's instructions were carried out; and when the guests returned from the banquet some men from the city were asked to come to entertain them with conversation respecting the various joys of the society. When they arrived they exchanged the customary salutations, and engaged in pleasant discourse as they walked about. But the angel said: "These ten men were invited to this heaven to learn of its joys, and thus to receive a new idea of eternal happiness. Describe, then, some of its joys which affect the bodily senses. Some wise men will come later, who will tell how these become the joys of blessing and happiness." On hearing this, those who were invited from the city gave the following account:<p>1. In this society there are days of festivity appointed by the prince, for the mental relaxation of some from fatigue induced by their eagerness to excel in service. On these days there are musical performances and singing in public places, and outside the city, sports and stage shows. In the public places are raised platforms surrounded with balustrades of interwoven vines, from which hang bunches of grapes. Within the lattice-work in three tiers sit the musicians with stringed and wind instruments, high toned and low toned, loud and soft; and at the sides are singers of both sexes, who delight the citizens with most beautiful hymns and songs, choruses and solos, in varied succession. This music continues on these festive days from morn till noon, and then till evening.</p>
<p>
[2] 2. Moreover, every morning from the houses round the public places there are heard the sweetest songs of maidens and young girls, which resound throughout the whole city. Each morning the song, by musical modifications or modulations, expresses a particular affection of spiritual love; and this is perceived in the singing as though this affection were actually present. It flows into the minds of the hearers, and awakens in them a corresponding emotion; for this is the nature of heavenly song. These singers say that the sound of their singing is inspired and animated from within, and is raised to joyous exaltation according to its reception by the hearers. When the singing is ended, the windows and doors of the houses round the markets and public places are closed, and silence reigns throughout the whole city. No noise is heard anywhere, and no one is seen wandering about the streets, but all are intent upon the duties of their employment.</p>
<p>
[3] 3. At noon the doors are opened, and in the afternoon the windows of some of the houses also; and boys and girls are seen playing in the streets, while their nurses and teachers sit in the porches of the houses, watching over them.</p>
<p>
[4] 4. In the outskirts of the city boys and youths engage in various sports, such as foot races, games of ball and rackets. There are also trials of skill among the boys to test their quickness in speech, action and perception; and those who excel receive as a reward a wreath of laurel; and there are many other ways of calling forth their latent talents.</p>
<p>
[5] 5. There are also outside the city dramatic performances on stages when the various graces and virtues of the moral life are portrayed by actors, some of whom are chosen for their ability to play graded parts. <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
One of the ten asked, "What is meant by graded parts?" The spokesman replied: "It is not possible to represent fully any virtue with its graces and proprieties unless by portraying these in sequence from their greatest to their least forms; and actors portray these forms as long as any virtue remains in them. It is provided by law, however, that they should not portray anything that is opposed to these, namely, what is disgraceful and improper, unless indirectly, and, as it were, remotely. It is so provided because nothing that is honorable and good in any virtue passes by successive stages into what is dishonorable and evil: it diminishes till nothing of it remains, and then its opposite begins to make its appearance. Therefore, heaven, where all things are honorable and good, has nothing in common with hell, where all things are dishonorable and evil."<p>

<a href="#fn9_1">1</a>.&nbsp;Sunt histriones propter relationes. The idea would appear to be that actors are chosen to represent forms of graces and proprieties as these vary from the highest to the lowest, and as these are the lowest, and as these are related in sequence from highest to lowest. Relatio in Swedenborg generally indicates relativity, with reference to the sequence in which things spiritual and material stand to one another, and not the idea of relation as a narrative. <a href="swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_763.htm">763</a>. </p>

745. Cum redierunt, factum est ita, et vocati ex urbe, qui sermone de variis gaudiis Societatis oblectarent illos, venerunt, et hi post salutationes ambulando loquebantur elegantias cum illis: sed Angelus ductor illorum dixit, quod decem hi viri invitati sint in hoc Coelum, ut videant Gaudia ejus, et inde novam ideam de Felicitate aeterna recipiant; commemorate ergo aliqua de gaudiis ejus, quae afficiunt sensus corporis; postea venturi sunt Sapientes, qui memorabunt aliqua, quae illa gaudia reddunt fausta et felicia; his auditis vocati ex urbe commemorabant haec. [1.] Sunt hic dies festivitatis indicti a Principe, ut animi relaxentur a defatigatione, quam cupiditas aemulationis aliquibus induxerat; his diebus sunt Harmoniae musicae et Cantus in foris, et extra urbem Ludi et Spectacula; in Foris tunc sunt elevatae Orchestrae circumductae cancellis consertis ex vitibus, e quibus pendent botri, intra quos in tribus elevationibus sedent Musici cum instrumentis chordae, et cum instrumentis soni, vocis altae et vocis humilis, ac vocis strenuae et vocis blandae, et ad latera sunt Cantores et Cantrices, et cum amaenissimis jubilis et cantibus, mixtis et solis, per intervalla quoad species variatis, cives oblectant; haec ibi diebus illis festivitatis a mane ad meridiem, et post hanc ad vesperam, persistunt.</p>
<p>
[2] Praeterea unoquovis mane e domibus circum Fora audiuntur suavissimi Cantus virginum et puellarum, ex quibus tota urbs personat; est una affectio amoris spiritualis, quae quovis mane cantatur, hoc est, per modificationes vocis canorae seu modulationes sonatur, et affectio illa in cantu percipitur sicut ipsa foret; influit in audientium animas, et excitat illas ad correspondentiam; talis est cantus coelestis; dicunt cantrices, quod sonus cantus illarum se sicut inspiret et animet ex interiori, et jucunde exaltet, secundum receptionem ab audientibus: hoc finito, clauduntur fenestrae domuum Fori, et simul domuum platearum, et quoque januae, et tunc silet tota urbs, nec ullibi auditur clamor, nec apparent vagabundi; omnes tunc accincti obeunt munia suorum officiorum.</p>
<p>
[3] At tempore meridiei aperiuntur januae, et post meridiem etiam alicubi fenestrae, et spectantur ludi puerorum et puellarum in plateis, moderantibus illos alumnis et magistris illorum, sedentibus in porticibus domuum.</p>
<p>
[4] Ad latera urbis in ejus extremis, sunt varii ludi puerorum et adolescentum; sunt ludi cursorii, sunt ludi cum pilis; sunt ludi cum pilaminibus repercussis, rachets <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
vocatis; sunt certamina palaestrica inter pueros, quis impigrior et quis pigrior loquendo, agendo et percipiendo; et pro impigrioribus aliqua folia laurus in praemium; praeter plura alia, quae sunt excitatoria habilitatum in pueris latentium.</p>
<p>
[5] Insuper extra urbem sunt Spectacula comoedorum super theatris, repraesentantium varias vitae moralis honestates et virtutes, inter quos etiam sunt histriones propter relationes; et quaesivit unus ex decem, quid propter relationes, et responderunt, non potest aliqua virtus cum ejus honestis et decoris sisti ad vivum, nisi per relativa ab illorum maximis ad minima; histriones repraesentant minima illorum usque dum fiunt nulla; sed lege sancitum est, ne aliquid oppositi, quod vocatur inhonestum et indecorum, nisi figurate et sicut e longinquo exhibeant: quod ita sancitum sit, est causa, quia non aliquod honestum et bonum alicujus virtutis per successivas progressiones transit ad inhonestum et malum, sed ad minima ejus usque dum perit, et cum perit inchoat oppositum; quare Coelum, ubi omnia honesta et bona sunt, nihil commune habet cum inferno, ubi omnia inhonesta et mala sunt.<p>
