741. After that, the angel said to them, "It is almost noon. Come with me into the garden of our prince, which is next to the palace. "
<p>They went to the garden. At the entrance to it the angel said, "Enjoy this, the most magnificent of all the gardens in this heavenly community. "
<p>"What are you saying?" was their reply. "There is no garden here. We see just a single tree. On its branches and on its top we see something like pieces of fruit made of gold and leaves made of silver with emeralds along their edges, and under the tree there are little children with their caregivers. "
<p>The angel replied in an inspired voice: "The tree you mention is at the center of the garden. We call it 'the tree of our heaven'; others refer to it as the tree of life. Keep going forward, though, and get closer to it, and your eyes will be opened and you will see the garden. "
<p>They did so, and their eyes were opened. They saw trees bearing abundant edible fruit, with grapevines wrapped around their limbs. The fruit-laden tops of the trees were bowing inward toward the tree of life at the center.
</p>
<p>
[2] These trees were laid out in a long curving row that extended and came around to form the arcing arm of a grand spiral. It was a perfect spiral of trees, in which one species followed another according to the relative excellence of its kind of fruit. A large interspace separated the beginning of the spiral from the tree at the center; this open space was sparkling with a gleaming light, which lit the trees in such a way that each tree seemed to pass the glow on to the next, from the first trees all the way to the last.
<p>The trees toward the center were the most excellent of all. They were covered in rich, sumptuous fruit. Called paradise trees, they were unlike anything that has ever been or could ever be witnessed on earth or anywhere in the physical universe. The trees next to them were various kinds of trees that yield oil; then came various kinds of trees that yield wines; then trees that give off beautiful fragrances; and finally trees whose wood is used for making things.
<p>Here and there along this long, spiraling line of trees there were living benches that had been crafted by bending and weaving together the branches of the tree just behind them; these were decorated with an abundance of the tree's fruits. Along the continuous arcing line of trees there were openings that led into flower gardens, and these led to lawns that were divided into grassy areas and flower beds.
<p>Seeing all this, the people accompanying the angel said, "It is heaven itself laid out before us! Wherever we turn our eyes, we encounter something of heaven, something of paradise, that is beyond description. "
<p>The angel rejoiced to hear this, and said, "All the gardens in our heaven are representative forms or models of the origins of heavenly blessings. The reason why you exclaimed, 'It is heaven itself laid out before us,' is that an actual inflow of these blessings lifted your minds. People who are not open to that inflow only see these garden paradises as a forest. People who love being useful are receptive to this inflow; people who love glory apart from usefulness are not. "
<p>Then the angel explained to them and taught them the meaning and representation of all the individual features of the garden. </p>

741. After this the angel said to them: 'It is not mid-day yet. Come with me into our prince's garden, which adjoins this palace.' So they went, and at the entrance he said: 'This is a magnificent garden, even compared with those in this heavenly community of ours.'<p>'What do you mean?' they answered, 'there is no garden here. We can see only one tree, with what look like golden fruits on its branches and its top, and what look like leaves of silver, their edges decorated with emeralds; and under the tree there are children with their nurses.'<p>To this the angel replied with deep feeling in his voice: 'This tree is in the middle of the garden, and we call it the tree of our heaven; some call it the tree of life. But go closer and your eyes will be opened, and you will see the garden.' They did so, and their eyes were opened, and they saw trees teeming with tasty fruits, with grape-vines trained round them; and their tops with fruit on them nodded towards the tree of life in the middle.</p>
<p>
[2] These trees were planted in an unbroken row, extending outward and running in constant circles or rings, like a never-ending spiral. It was a perfect spiral of trees, in which one species followed another arranged in order of the nobility of their fruits. There was a considerable gap between the beginning of the spiral and the tree in the middle, and this gap sparkled with gleams of light, which made the trees of the ring shine with a splendour running in graduated steps from the first to the last. The first trees were the most outstanding of all, luxuriant with the finest fruits; these were called trees of paradise, something never seen before because they do not, nor can they, exist on earth in the natural world. These were followed by trees that yield oil, and these by trees that yield wine. After these came trees with a fragrant scent, and finally trees with wood useful for making things. Here and there in this spiral or ring of trees were seats shaped out of tree-shoots brought and woven together from behind, enriched and embellished with their fruits. There were gates in this unbroken circle of trees, leading to flower gardens, and these leading to lawns, divided by plots and beds.</p>
<p>
[3] When the angel's companions saw these they cried: 'Here is heaven made visible! Whichever way we turn our gaze, there is an impression made on us of heavenly paradise, beyond description.' The angel was delighted to hear this, and said: 'All the gardens in our heaven are visible forms or models representing the varied blessedness of heaven in their origins. It was because the varied blessedness flowing in uplifted your minds that you cried: "Here is heaven made visible!" Those, however, who do not receive that inflow look upon these paradises as no more than woodland. It is all those who have a love for performing services who receive that inflow. Those who do not receive it have a love for glory, which is not for the use it is.' Afterwards he set forth and instructed them what was the representation and meaning of each detail in that garden. </p>

741. After this the angel said to them, "It is not yet noon; come with me into the garden of our prince which adjoins this palace." They went; and at the entrance the angel said, "Behold the most magnificent garden in this heavenly society." <p>But they replied, "What do you say? There is no garden here; we see only one tree, with what seems like fruits of gold on its branches and top, and like leaves of silver, with their edges adorned with emeralds; and under the tree we see little children with their nurses." <p>To this the angel with inspired voice replied, "This tree is in the midst of the garden, and is called by us the tree of our heaven, and by some the tree of life. But go on and draw nearer, and your eyes will be opened, and you will see the garden." <p>This they did; and their eyes were opened, and they saw trees heavily laden with delicious fruit, about which vines entwined their tendrils, and their tops were bent down with fruit toward the tree of life in the center.
</p>
<p>
[2] These trees were planted in a continuous row, which went out and on in endless circles or curves like those of a perpetual spiral; it was a perfect spiral formed by trees, wherein one species followed another in unbroken order according to the excellence of their fruit. There was quite a space between the beginning of the spiral and the tree in the center, and this space gleamed with a radiance that made the trees of the spiral beam with an unbroken and unceasing splendor from the first to the last. The first trees were the noblest of all, luxuriant with the rarest fruit; these were called trees of paradise, never having been seen in any country of the natural world, because they do not and cannot exist there. These were followed by olive trees, then those that yielded wine, then fragrant trees, and finally trees useful to workmen for the wood. Here and there in this coil of trees or spiral there were seats formed of branches of the trees behind drawn forward and interlaced and enriched and adorned with their fruits. In that perpetual circle of trees were passages opening to flower-plots, and from these to lawns, divided off into squares and beds.
</p>
<p>
[3] The companions of the angel, on seeing these things, ex-claimed, "Behold heaven in form! Wherever we turn our eyes something heavenly and paradisal meets them, which is ineffable." <p>The angel was delighted with these exclamations, and said, "All our heavenly gardens are representative forms or types of heavenly beatitudes in their origin, and because your minds were exalted by the influx of these beatitudes, you exclaimed, 'Behold heaven in form!' But those who do not receive that influx look upon these paradisal objects only as upon a mere forest. All who are in a love of use receive the influx; but those who are in the love of glory not from use do not receive it." Afterwards he explained and taught what was represented and signified by each thing in the garden. </p>

741. The angel then said to them, "It is not yet noon; come with me into our prince's garden, which is near the palace." So they went with him; and as they were entering he said, "This is the most magnificent garden in our heavenly society." But they replied, "What do you say? There is no garden here; we see only one tree, and on its branches and on its top what seem like golden fruit, and silver leaves with their edges adorned with emeralds, and beneath the tree little children with their nurses." To this the angel with inspired voice said: "This tree is in the midst of the garden, and is called by us the tree of our heaven, and by some, the tree of life; but proceed and draw near, and your eyes will be opened, and you will see the garden." They did so, and their eyes were opened and they saw trees laden with delicious fruit, entwined about with young vines whose tops laden with fruit inclined towards the tree of life in the centre.</p>
<p>
[2] These trees were planted in a continuous series which spread out and extended into endless rings or circles, like those of a continuous spiral; it was a perfect spiral of trees in which one kind followed close upon another, according to the excellence of their fruit. The outermost curve of the spiral was at a considerable distance from the tree in the centre, and the space between sparkled with sunlight, which caused the trees of each curve to glow with splendor in their order continuously from first to last. The first trees were the most excellent of all, producing bountifully the choicest fruits; these were called the trees of paradise, and are nowhere to be seen in any region of the natural world, because they do not and cannot grow there. After these came olive trees, then vines, then fragrant smelling trees, and lastly trees whose timber is useful in handicraft. Here and there in this spiral or curving expanse of trees there were seats formed by bringing forward and intertwining branches of the trees; and they were enriched and adorned by the fruits. There were also openings leading to flower gardens, and from these to green places, laid out in lawns and banks.</p>
<p>
[3] At the sight of these things the companions of the angel exclaimed, "This is indeed a form of heaven! Wherever we turn our eyes we take in something ineffably heavenly and paradisaic." When he heard this, the angel was pleased and said: "All the gardens of our heaven are in their origin representative forms or types of heavenly blessedness; and because the influx of this blessedness has elevated your minds, you exclaimed, 'This is indeed a form of heaven.' Those, however, who do not receive that influx see these paradisaic gardens merely as forests. All those receive the influx who are in the love of use; but not those who act from the love of glory and not from the motive of use." He then explained to them what each thing in the garden represented and signified. </p>

741. Post haec Angelus dixit illis, nondum est Meridies diei; venite mecum in Principis nostri Hortum, Palatio huic contiguum, et iverunt, ac in introitu dixit, en Hortus magnificus prae hortis in Coelesti hac Societate; at responderunt, quid dicis; non hic est Hortus; videmus modo unam Arborem, ac in ramis et in vertice ejus sicut fructus ex auro, et sicut folia ex argento, et horum oras exornatas smaragdis; et sub illa Arbore infantes cum alumnis illorum. Ad haec Angelus voce inspirata dixit; haec Arbor est in medio Horti, et a nobis vocatur Arbor nostri Coeli, et a quibusdam Arbor vitae. Sed pergite, et appropinquate, et aperientur oculi vestri, et videbitis Hortum; ac fecerunt ita, et aperti sunt oculi, et videbant Arbores uberrimas fructibus saporis, circumligatas vitibus pampineis, quarum vertices cum fructibus nutabant versus Arborem vitae in medio.</p>
<p>
[2] Arbores hae in continua serie consitae erant, quae exibat et pergebat in perennes orbes seu gyros sicut perpetuae helicis; erat perfecta Helix arborea, in qua species post species continue secundum nobilitates fructuum sequebantur: principium circumgyrationis distabat ab Arbore in medio insigni intervallo, ac intervallum coruscabat jubare lucis, ex quo arbores gyri splendebant splendore successivo et continuato a primis ad ultimas: primae arbores erant omnium praestantissimae, fructibus opimis luxuriantes, vocatae Paradisiacae, nusquam visae quia non datae nec dabiles in terris Mundi naturalis; post has excipiebant arbores olei; post has arbores vini; post has arbores fragrantiae; ac ultimo arbores ligni utiles ad fabricas. Hic et ibi in hac Helice arborea seu in hoc gyro erant Sedilia formata ex adductis et complicatis propaginibus arborum a tergo, ac opimata et exornata fructibus illarum. In perpetuo illo Orbe arboreo erant ostia, quae patebant in floreta, et ab his in vireta, distincta in areas et toros.</p>
<p>
[3] Comites Angeli his visis exclamabant, en Coelum in forma; quocunque vertimus acies oculorum nostrorum, influit aliquid Coeleste Paradisiacum, quod est ineffabile. His auditis Angelus gavisus est, et dixit, omnes Horti nostri Coeli sunt Formae repraesentativae seu Typi beatitudinum coelestium in suis originibus, et quia influxus harum beatitudinum elevavit mentes vestras, clamavistis, en Coelum in forma; at illi, qui non recipiunt illum influxum, spectant Paradisiaca haec non aliter quam sylvestria; et omnes illi recipiunt influxum, qui in amore usus sunt, at illum non recipiunt, qui in amore gloriae sunt, et non ex usu. Postea exposuit et docuit, quid singula Horti istius repraesentabant et significabant. </p>
