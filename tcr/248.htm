248. 聖言每一細節處皆有主與教會,因而良善與真理的結合
<p>聖言的每一細節處都有主與教會,因而良善與真理的結合, 迄今為止並不明白, 也無法明白, 因為聖言的屬靈意義並未揭示。只有藉著屬靈意義方可看到這樣的結合, 因為聖言的兩層意義(屬靈意義和屬天意義)隱藏在其文字意義之中。聖言的這些內在意義中, 屬靈意義與教會相關, 屬天意義與主相關。而且, 屬靈意義與聖理有關, 屬天意義與聖善有關; 聖言中存在這樣的結合就是由此而來。
<p>然而這樣的結合並非向任何人顯明, 除非向那些曉得聖言中名字和詞語代表的屬靈與屬天含義之人。某些字句與名字應用於良善方面, 有些應用於真理方面, 有些二者都適用。因此, 若不知道這些含義, 聖言細節之中的如此結合就無法被看見; 這就是如此奧秘至今未被揭示的原因。
<p>因為聖言的細節之中有如此的結合存在, 因此在聖言中經常有成對的表達,看起來如同重複同一個事物。然而並非重複, 其中之一關於良善, 另一個關於真理; 二者在一起建立了它們的結合, 因而表達了同一件事情。
<p>聖言的神聖也因此而來, 因為每一神聖之作為必是善與理,理與善的結合。 </p>

248. 9. There Is a Marriage between the Lord and the Church, and Therefore a Marriage between Goodness and Truth, in the Individual Details in the Word
<p>Until now people have not seen that there is a marriage between the Lord and the church, and therefore a marriage between goodness and truth, in the individual details in the Word. It has been impossible for people to see this because the Word's spiritual meaning was not revealed before, and this marriage is visible only through the spiritual meaning.
<p>There are two meanings in the Word that lie hidden inside its literal meaning. They are called the spiritual meaning and the heavenly meaning. The elements of the Word's spiritual meaning relate primarily to the church, and the elements of its heavenly meaning relate primarily to the Lord. The elements of the Word's spiritual meaning also relate to divine truth, while the elements of the heavenly meaning relate to divine goodness. These two come together in the marriage that exists in the Word.
<p>This is not apparent, though, to any except those who know what the names and the words stand for in the Word's spiritual and heavenly meanings. Some words and names apply to something good, others to something true; some words and names apply to both goodness and truth. If we do not know this, we cannot see the marriage in the individual details in the Word; this secret has not been discovered before, because of this blindness.
<p>Because this type of marriage exists in the individual details in the Word, there are often two-part expressions whose elements seem like repetitions of the same thing. These are not in fact repetitions. One element relates to goodness and the other to truth. Both of them taken together form a composite and become one thing. The divine holiness of the Word is a result of this also. In every divine work there is goodness united to truth and truth united to goodness. </p>

248. IX. The details of the Word all contain a marriage of the Lord and the church, and so a marriage of good and truth.<p>Up to now it has not been seen that the details of the Word contain a marriage of the Lord and the church, and so a marriage of good and truth. Nor could this be seen, because the spiritual sense of the Word has not before been revealed, and that marriage can only be seen by means of that sense. The Word has two senses hidden in its literal sense; these are called the spiritual and the celestial senses. In the spiritual sense the contents of the Word refer chiefly to the church, and in the celestial sense chiefly to the Lord. Again in the spiritual sense its contents refer to Divine truth, and in the celestial sense to Divine good. Hence there is this marriage in the Word. But this is not apparent except to those who have learned from the spiritual and celestial senses of the Word the meanings of the words and names. For certain words and names are used of good, and certain of truth, and some include both. So without this knowledge it was impossible to see this marriage in the details of the Word. This is the reason this secret was not previously revealed.<p>It is because this kind of marriage is contained in the details of the Word, that it so often uses two expressions which appear to repeat the same thing. Yet they are not really repetitions, but one refers to good, the other to truth; and the two taken together make this link and so form a single unit. This too is the source of the Divine holiness of the Word; for in every Divine act good is joined with truth and truth with good.<p>It is because this kind of marriage is contained in the details of the Word, that it so often uses two expressions which appear to repeat the same thing.

248. IX. IN EVERY PARTICULAR OF THE WORD THERE IS A MARRIAGE OF THE LORD AND THE CHURCH, AND IN CONSEQUENCE A MARRIAGE OF GOOD AND TRUTH. <p>That in every particular of the Word there is a marriage of the Lord and the church, and in consequence a marriage of good and truth, has not been seen heretofore; nor could it be seen because the spiritual sense of the Word has not been disclosed until now, and through that only can this marriage be seen. For there are two senses in the Word, concealed within the sense of its letter, which are called the spiritual sense and the celestial sense. These interior contents of the Word have relation in the spiritual sense chiefly to the church, and in the celestial sense chiefly to the Lord. Again these contents have relation in the spiritual sense to Divine truth, and in the celestial sense to Divine good. From this there is in the Word such a marriage. But this is manifest only to those who from the spiritual and celestial senses of the Word know the significations of the words and names; for some words and names are predicated of good, and some of truth, and some include both; therefore without a knowledge of their significance, that marriage in the particulars of the Word cannot be seen. This is why this arcanum has not been disclosed until now. Because there is such a marriage in every particular of the Word, there are very often two expressions in it that appear like repetitions of the same thing; and yet they are not repetitions, but one of them has relation to good and the other to truth; and the two taken together constitute their conjunction, and thus one thing. From this also is the Divine holiness of the Word; for in every Divine work there is good conjoined with truth, and truth conjoined with good. </p>

248. IX. IN EVERY DETAIL OF THE WORD THERE IS THE MARRIAGE OF THE LORD AND THE CHURCH, AND CONSEQUENTLY THE MARRIAGE OF GOOD AND TRUTH.<p>Hitherto it has not been recognized that there is in every detail of the Word the marriage of the Lord and the Church, and consequently the marriage of good and truth; nor could it be seen, because the spiritual sense of the Word had not been revealed till now, and this sense alone can make this marriage evident. For there are two senses in the Word, called the spiritual and the celestial, concealed within the sense of the Letter; what belongs to the spiritual sense has special reference to the Church, and what belongs to the celestial sense, to the Lord. The content also of the spiritual sense has reference to Divine Truth, and the content of the celestial sense to Divine Good; and consequently there is in the Word this marriage. However, this is apparent only to those who, from the spiritual and celestial senses of the Word, know the signification of words and names, some words and names being predicated of good, some of truth, and some including both references. Therefore, without a knowledge of this signification, this marriage in every detail of the Word cannot be seen, and consequently this interior truth has not hitherto been discovered. Since there exists such a marriage in every detail of the Word, therefore double expressions frequently occur in it, which seem like repetitions of the same thing. They are, however, not repetitions; but one relates to good and the other to truth, and when both are taken together they effect the conjunction of good and truth, and so combine them into one. This also is the ground of the Divine sanctity of the Word; for in every Divine work there is a conjunction of good with truth, and of truth with good. </p>

248. IX. Quod in singulis Verbi sit Conjugium Domini et Ecclesiae, et inde Conjugium boni et veri.<p>Quod in singulis Verbi sit Conjugium Domini et Ecclesiae, et inde Conjugium boni et veri, hactenus non visum est, nec videri potuit, quia Sensus spiritualis Verbi non prius detectus est, et id conjugium non videri potest nisi per illum: sunt enim bini Sensus in Verbo, latentes in Sensu literae ejus, qui vocantur Spiritualis et Coelestis; in Spirituali Sensu in Verbo se referunt illa quae ejus sunt, maxime ad Ecclesiam, et in Coelesti maxime ad Dominum; tum in Spirituali sensu se referunt illa quae ejus sunt ad Divinum Verum, et in Coelesti ad Divinum Bonum; inde est in Verbo illud Conjugium. Sed hoc non apparet alicui, nisi qui ex Sensu spirituali et coelesti Verbi scit vocum et nominum significationes, nam quaedam voces et nomina praedicantur de Bono, et quaedam de Vero, et quaedam includunt utrumque; quare absque illa cognitione Conjugium illud in singulis Verbi non videri potuit: haec causa est, quod hoc Arcanum non prius detectum fuerit. Quoniam tale conjugium in singulis Verbi est, ideo multoties in Verbo sunt binae Expressiones, quae apparent sicut Repetitiones unius rei; attamen non sunt Repetitiones, sed una se refert ad bonum, et altera ad verum, ac utraque simul sumta facit conjunctionem illorum, ita unam rem. Inde etiam est Divina sanctitas Verbi; nam in omni Opere Divino est Bonum conjunctum Vero, ac Verum conjunctum Bono. </p>
