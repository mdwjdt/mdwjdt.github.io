845. When they are asked whether they are completely convinced that all of them are going to come into the land of Canaan, they reply, "Yes. All will be included in this. And Jews who have died will be resurrected and will leave their graves; they too will come into the land of Canaan. "
<p>When they are told that it is impossible for the dead to come out of their graves, because those who have died are living now after death, they reply, "They will come down from where they are now and reenter their bodies. That's how they will come back to life. "
<p>When they are told that the land of Canaan is not large enough to hold them all, they reply, "It will be enlarged. "
<p>When they are told that the kingdom of the Messiah, because he is the Son of God, is going to be in heaven, not on earth, they reply, "The land of Canaan is going to be heaven. "
<p>When it is pointed out that they do not know the location of Bethlehem of Ephrathah, where the Messiah will be born according to the prophecies in Micah (<a href="3927/micah_5_2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>) and David (<a href="3927/psalms_132_6.htm">Psalms 132:6</a>), they reply, "The Messiah's mother will nevertheless give birth there. " Some say, "Wherever she gives birth, that will be Bethlehem. "
</p>
<p>
[2] When they are asked how the Messiah could dwell with such evil people, and this charge is backed up by citing many passages in Jeremiah and especially the song of Moses, which indicates that they are the worst (Deuteronomy 32), they reply, "Among Jews some are good and some are evil; those passages refer to the Jews who are evil. "
<p>When they are told that they were originally descended from a Canaanite woman and also from Judah's whoring with his own daughter-in-law (Genesis 38), they reply, "That was not an act of whoring. "
<p>When they hear the retort that Judah commanded her to be brought out and burned because of her whoring [<a href="3927/genesis_38_24.htm">Genesis 38:24</a>], they go off and consult with each other. After their consultation they say, "That was only the fulfillment of the brother-in-law's obligation that Judah's second son Onan and his third son Shelah had failed to perform. "
<p>They add, "Most of us are descended not from the tribe of Judah but from the tribe of Levi, which was charged with the priestly responsibilities; but the important thing is that we have all descended from Abraham. "
<p>When they are told that there is a spiritual meaning existing within the Word that has much to say about Christ or the Messiah, they reply, "That is not true. " Some of them say, "Inwardly in the Word, in its depths, there is nothing but gold. " And many other statements to the same effect. </p>

845. On being asked whether they are sure that they will all come to the land of Canaan, they reply that all will then come, and then the dead Jews will rise again and leave their graves to enter that land. When it is objected that there is no way they can leave their graves since they are already living after death, they reply that they will then go down and enter into their bodies and live like that. On being told that that land is not large enough to hold them all, they reply that it will then be enlarged. When told that the kingdom of the Messiah, since He is the Son of God, will not be on earth, but in heaven, they reply that the land of Canaan will then be heaven. When told that they do not know the location of Bethlehem in Ephrathah, where the Messiah is to be born according to the prophecy of Micah (<a href="3927/micah_5_2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>) and the Psalms of David (<a href="3927/psalms_132_6.htm">Psalm 132:6</a>), they reply that none the less the mother of the Messiah will give birth there; some say that wherever she gives birth will be Bethlehem. When asked how can the Messiah live with such wicked people, and a number of passages from Jeremiah and in particular the Song of Moses (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_1.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>) are quoted to prove that they are most wicked, they reply that there are both good and wicked people among the Jews, and in those passages it is the wicked who are meant.<p>When they are told that their line of descent goes back to a woman of Canaan and to Judah's whoring with his daughter-in-law (Gen. chapter 38), they reply that it was not whoring. But when it is objected that none the less Judah ordered her to be brought out and burned because she played the whore, they go away to discuss the matter. After discussion they say that it was simply a levirate marriage, which neither his second son Onan nor his third son Shelah had consummated. They add that very many of them are of the tribe of Levi, which held the priesthood. 'It is enough,' they say, 'that we are all from the loins of Abraham.' When they are told that the Word contains within it a spiritual sense, in which much is said about Christ or the Messiah, they reply that it is not so. But some of them say that within the Word, at its bottom, there is nothing but gold; and other similar things besides. </p>

845. When they are asked whether they firmly believe that they will all get to the land of Canaan, they say that all will then go there, and that the Jews who are dead will then rise again, and from their sepulchres will enter that land. To the reply that they cannot possibly come out of the sepulchres, because they are already living after death they say that they will then descend and enter their bodies, and so live again. When told that the land cannot hold them all, they reply that it will then be enlarged. When told that the kingdom of the Messiah, because He is the Son of God, will not be on earth but in heaven, they reply that the land of Canaan will then be heaven. When told that they do not know where Bethlehem Ephratah is, where the Messiah is to be born, according to the prediction in Micah (<a href="3927/micah_5_2.htm">5:2</a>), and in the<a href="3927/psalms_132_6.htm">Psalms (132:6</a>), they reply that the mother of the Messiah will nevertheless there give birth to Him; and some say that wherever she brings forth there is Bethlehem. When they are asked how the Messiah can dwell with such wicked people, and it is proved by many passages in Jeremiah, and especially by the sons of Moses (Deuteronomy 32), that they are the worst of men, they reply that among the Jews there are both good and bad, and that the bad are there meant. When they are told that they sprang from a Canaanitish woman, and from Judah's whoredom with his daughter-in-law (Genesis 38), they answer that that was not whoredom. But when to this it is replied that still Judah commanded her to be brought forth and burnt for whoredom, they go away to consult about it, and after consultation say that Judah only acted the part of a brother-in-law, a duty which neither his second son, Onan, nor his third son, Selah, fulfilled. And to this they add that very many of them are of the tribe of Levi, who held the priestly office, and that it is enough that they are all from the loins of Abraham. When they are told that within the Word there is a spiritual sense wherein Christ or the Messiah is fully treated of, they reply that this is not true; and some of them say that within the Word, or in its depths, there is nothing but gold; and other such statements they make. </p>

845. When they are asked whether they firmly believe that they will all go into the land of Canaan, they reply that all will, and that the Jews who are dead will rise again, and emerging from their sepulchres, will enter that land. When it is rejoined that they can never come forth from their sepulchres since they themselves are living after death, they answer that they will then descend, re-enter their bodies, and so live. When they are told that the land of Canaan is not large enough to contain them all, they answer that it will then be enlarged. When it is urged that the kingdom of the Messiah, because He is the Son of God, will not be upon earth, but in heaven, they answer that the land of Canaan will then be heaven. When it is said that they do not know the situation of Bethlehem Ephratah, where the Messiah will be born, according to the prophecy in <a href="3927/micah_5_2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, and in David, <a href="3927/psalms_132_8.htm">Psalm 132:8</a>, they answer that the mother of the Messiah will, nevertheless, bring forth in that place; and some of them declare that wherever she brings forth, there is Bethlehem. When they are asked how the Messiah can dwell with those who are so wicked, and it is proved by many passages from Jeremiah, and particularly from the Song of Moses, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_1.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>, that they are the worst of all, they reply that there are among the Jews both good and bad, and that the bad are meant in those passages. When they are told that they spring from a Canaanitish woman, and from the whoredom of Judah with his daughter-in-law, <a href="3927/genesis_38_1.htm">Genesis 38</a>, they answer that it was not whoredom. But when it is rejoined that Judah commanded her to be brought forth and burnt for her whoredom, they retire to consult about it; and after consultation they say that he only performed the duty of the husband's brother, which neither his second son Onan, nor his third son Selah, performed. They add further that a great many of them are of the tribe of Levi, who held the priesthood, and it is enough that "we are all sprung from Abraham." When they are told that interiorly there is within the Word a spiritual sense, which largely treats of Christ or the Messiah, they reply that it is not so. Some of them, however, say that interiorly in the Word, that is, in its depths, there is nothing but gold; and they make other statements of the same nature. </p>

845. Dum interrogantur num firmiter credant, quod omnes in Terram Canaanem venturi sint, dicunt quod tunc omnes, et quod tunc Judaei defuncti resurrecturi sint, et quod ex sepulchris suis intraturi Terram illam; cum regeritur, quod nequaquam possint exire sepulchris, quoniam ipsi post mortem vivunt; respondent quod tunc descensuri sint, ac intraturi sua corpora, et sic victuri. Cum dicitur; quod Terra illa non possit capax esse omnium, respondent quod tunc ampliabitur. Cum dicitur, quod Regnum Messiae, quia Filius Dei est, non futurum sit super Terra, sed in Coelo, respondent quod Terra Canaan tunc futura sit Coelum. Cum dicitur, quod non sciant ubi Bethlechem Ephrataea, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
ubi Messias nascetur, secundum praedictionem apud <a href="3927/micah_5_1.htm">Micham 5:1</a>, <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
et apud Davidem <a href="3927/psalms_132_6.htm">Psalm 132:6</a>, respondent quod Mater Messiae usque ibi paritura sit; et aliqui, quod ubi illa parit, ibi sit Bethlechem.</p>
<p>
[2] Cum dicitur, quomodo potest Messias habitare cum tam malis, et hoc confirmatur per plura loca ex Jeremia, et imprimis ex Cantico Mosis, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_1.htm">Deuteronomius 32</a>, quod pessimi sint, respondent quod inter Judaeos tam boni quam mali sint, et quod mali ibi intellecti sint. Cum dicitur, quod ortus illorum sit ex Cananitide, et ex scortatione Judae cum sua nuru, <a href="3927/genesis_38_1.htm">Genesis 38</a>, respondent quod non fuerit scortatio; at cum regeritur, quod usque Judas mandaverit, ut illa propter scortationem educeretur, et combureretur, abeunt consultaturi, et post consultationem dicunt, quod modo fuerit Leviratus, quem non secundus ejus filius Onan, nec tertius ejus filius Schelah praestitit; et his addunt, quod perplurimi ex illis ex Tribu Levi sint, cui fuit presbyterium; sufficit, quod omnes simus ex lumbis Abrahami. Cum dicitur illis, quod interius in Verbo sensus spiritualis sit, in quo multum agitur de Christo seu Messia, respondent quod non ita sit; at quidam ex illis dicunt, quod interius in Verbo, seu in fundo ejus, non sit nisi quam aurum: Praeter similia alia.<p>
