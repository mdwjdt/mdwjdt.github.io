804. In the spiritual world, the Dutch are easily told apart from other nationalities because they wear much the same clothing as they did in the physical world, with the difference that the ones who receive faith and a spiritual life dress more nicely than they used to. The reason they appear to wear the same kind of clothes is that they remain steadfast in the principles of their religion, and all the people in the spiritual world are clothed according to their religious principles. This is why people who are devoted to divine truths wear white clothes and linen garments. </p>

804. The Dutch are easily distinguished from others in the spiritual world, because they are to be seen wearing similar clothes to those they wore in the natural world, with the difference that those who have received a spiritual faith and way of life have smarter clothes. The reason they wear similar clothes is that they cling so resolutely to their religious principles, and it is these which determine what everyone in the spiritual world wears. So those who possess Divine truths are dressed there in white garments and fine linen. </p>

804. The Dutch are easily distinguished from others in the spiritual world, because they appear in garments like those they wear in the natural world, with the difference that those who have received faith and spiritual life are more elegantly clad. They appear in like garments because they hold steadfastly to the principles of their religion, and in accordance with those principles all in the spiritual world are clad; and therefore those there who are in Divine truths have white garments and garments of fine linen. </p>

804. The Dutch in the spiritual world are readily distinguished from others because they appear in clothing like that which they wore in the natural world; with this difference, that those who have received faith and adopted the spiritual life are more finely clad. They appear in similar garments because they remain steadfast in the principles of their religion, and in the spiritual world all are clothed according to those principles. Hence white garments made of fine linen are worn by those who are in Divine truths. </p>

804. Hollandi dignoscuntur probe ab aliis in Mundo spirituali, quia in similibus vestibus apparent, in quibus in Mundo naturali, cum discrimine, quod in nitidioribus illi, qui receperunt Fidem et Vitam Spiritualem. Quod in similibus Vestibus appareant, est causa, quia in principiis Religionis suae constanter manent, et omnes in Mundo spirituali vestiuntur secundum illa: quare Vestimenta alba, et ex bysso, sunt illis ibi qui Divinis Veris sunt. </p>
