<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第247节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>247</b>.在先知书，有许多经文描述了以色列或犹太民族当中的教会如何因他们歪曲圣言的意义，或对圣言的理解而全然毁坏、化为乌有。摧毁一个教会的，正是这种歪曲，而非别的什么。对圣言的理解，无论真假，在先知书，尤其在何西阿书都被描述为“以法莲”。因为在圣言中，“以法莲”表示教会对圣言的理解。对圣言的理解构成教会，故以法莲被称为：<br />宝贝儿子，可喜悦的孩子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.20.htm">耶利米书31:20</a>）<br />长子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.9.htm">耶利米书31:9</a>）<br />护卫耶和华头的力量。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗60.7.htm">诗篇60:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗108.8.htm">108:8</a>）<br />勇士。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚10.7.htm">撒迦利亚书10:7</a>）<br />张弓的箭。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.13.htm">撒迦利亚书9:13</a>）<br />以法莲的子孙武装着拉弓的人。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.9.htm">诗篇78:9</a>）<br />因为弓表示取自圣言、与虚假作战的教义。因此，以法莲被转到以色列的右手，受到祝福，取代流便被接受（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创48.5.htm">创世记48:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创48.11.htm">11</a>等）。也因此，摩西在祝福以色列众子时，以他们的父亲约瑟之名将以法莲与他兄弟玛拿西提到其他所有人之上（<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.13.htm">申命记33:13</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.17.htm">17</a>）。<br />不过，当对圣言的理解被摧毁时，教会的光景在先知书也以“以法莲”来描绘，尤其是何西阿书，如以下经文：<br />以色列和以法莲必跌倒；以法莲必变为荒场；以法莲就受欺压，被审判压碎。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/何5.5.htm">何西阿书5:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何5.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何5.11.htm">11</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/何5.14.htm">14</a>）<br />以法莲哪，我可向你怎样行呢？因为你们的慈爱如同早晨的云雾，又如早散的朝露。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/何6.4.htm">何西阿书6:4</a>）<br />他们必不得住耶和华的地；以法莲却要归回埃及，必在亚述吃不洁净的食物。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.3.htm">何西阿书9:3</a>）<br />“耶和华的地”是指教会；“埃及”是指属世人的事实知识或记忆知识；“亚述”是指由此而来的推理。这二者一起歪曲对圣言的内在理解。这就是为何经上说“以法莲要归回埃及，必在亚述吃不洁净的食物”。<br />以法莲吃风，且追赶东风；终日加多虚谎和强暴；与亚述立约，油被送到埃及。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/何12.1.htm">何西阿书12:1</a>）<br />“吃风”、“追赶东风”和“加多虚谎和强暴”是指歪曲真理并因此摧毁教会。“以法莲行淫”有类似含义，因为“行淫”表示对圣言理解的歪曲，也就是对其纯正真理的歪曲；如以下经文：<br />我认识以法莲；他竟然行淫，以色列被玷污了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/何5.3.htm">何西阿书5:3</a>）<br />在以色列家，我见了可憎的事；在那里以法莲有淫行，以色列被玷污。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/何6.10.htm">何西阿书6:10</a>）<br />以色列是指教会本身，以法莲是指对圣言的理解，就是决定教会是哪类教会的源头。这就是为何经上说“以法莲有淫行，以色列被玷污”。<br />以色列和犹太民族中的教会因对圣言的歪曲而全然毁坏，故经上论到以法莲说：<br />以法莲哪，我必舍弃你。以色列啊，我必把你交出。我必使你如押玛。我必使你如洗扁。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/何11.8.htm">何西阿书11:8</a>）<br />因何西阿书这本先知书从第一章到最后一章都在论述对圣言正解的歪曲，以及由此导致的教会的毁灭，又因“行淫”表示其中真理的歪曲，所以这位先知被吩咐娶妓女为妻，和她生孩子（何西阿书1章），又去爱一个淫妇（何西阿书3章），以此来代表教会的这种状态。引用这些经文是为了通过圣言说明并证实：教会的性质取决于圣言在教会如何被理解。若教会的理解基于取自圣言的纯正真理，这样的教会就是优秀而珍贵的；若其理解基于歪曲的真理，那它就是毁坏、甚至污秽的。</p>

<p>
247. 在先知書許多地方, 因為以色列和猶太民族對聖言歪曲的理解, 他們的教會被描寫成全然毀壞,淪為虛無。除此之外, 沒有別的能摧毀教會。聖言或對或錯的理解, 在先知書中被描寫成"以法
<p>蓮", 特別是在『何西阿書』; 因為聖言中的"以法蓮"表示教會中對聖言的理解, 對聖言的理解又組成教會, 因此以法蓮被稱為:愛子, 可喜悅的孩子(<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_20.htm">耶利米書31:20</a>); 長子(<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_9.htm">耶利米書31:9</a>);護衛耶和華頭的(耶和華頭的力量)(<a href="3927/psalms_60_7.htm">詩篇60:7</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_108_8.htm">108:8</a>);勇士(<a href="3927/zechariah_10_7.htm">撒迦利亞書10:7</a>);張弓的箭(<a href="3927/zechariah_9_13.htm">撒迦利亞書9:13</a>);以法蓮的子孫帶著兵器, 拿著弓(<a href="3927/psalms_78_9.htm">詩篇78:9</a>)。因為弓表示聖言而來的教義與偽謬之間的戰鬥。因此, 以法蓮被換到以色列的右手, 並受祝福; 還被接受替代流便之位(<a href="3927/genesis_48_5.htm">創世記48:5</a>, <a href="3927/genesis_48_11.htm">11</a>及以後)。也因此, 在摩西祝福以色列眾子時, 以法蓮連同他兄弟瑪拿西, 列在他們父親約瑟的名下, 被抬舉高於其它弟兄之上(<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_13.htm">申命記33:13-17</a>)。
<p>[2]不過, 當對聖言的理解被摧毀時, 教會的光景在先知書也以"以法蓮"來描繪, 特別是在『何西阿書』, 例如以下章節:
<p>以色列和以法蓮必跌倒; 以法蓮必變為荒場; 以法蓮就受欺壓, 被審判壓碎(<a href="3927/hosea_5_5.htm">何西阿書5:5</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_5_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_5_11.htm">11-14</a>)。哦, 以法蓮哪, 我可向你怎樣行呢？你們的良善如同早晨的雲霧, 又如速散的甘露(<a href="3927/hosea_6_4.htm">何西阿書6:4</a>)。他們必不得住耶和華的地; 以法蓮卻要歸回埃及, 必
<p>在亞述吃不潔淨的食物(<a href="3927/hosea_9_3.htm">何西阿書9:3</a>)。
<p>"耶和華的地"是教會; "埃及"是屬世之人所理解的知識; "亞述"是由此而得出的理性; 這二者一同來歪曲聖言的內在意義; 因此說"以法蓮要歸回埃及, 必在亞述吃不潔淨的食物。"
<p>[3]以法蓮吃風, 且追趕東風; 時常增添虛謊和強暴, 與亞述立約, 把油送到埃及(<a href="3927/hosea_12_1.htm">何西阿書12:1</a>)。"吃風","追趕東風"和"增添虛謊和強暴"是指歪曲真理並因而摧毀教會。"以法蓮行淫"有類似的含義, 因為"行淫"表示對聖言理解的歪曲, 也就是對聖言中純正真理的歪曲; 正如下面所說:
<p>以法蓮為我所知; 以法蓮哪, 現在你行淫了, 以色列被玷污了(<a href="3927/hosea_5_3.htm">何西阿書5:3</a>)。在以色列家, 我見了可憎的事; 在以法蓮那裡有淫行, 以色列被玷污(<a href="3927/hosea_6_10.htm">何西阿書6:10</a>)。以色列是教會自身, 以法蓮是對聖言的理解, 由此並照此就是教會。因此說"以法蓮有淫行, 以色列被玷污"。
<p>[4]因著對聖言的歪曲, 與以色列和猶太民族同在的教會變得全然毀壞, 所以說到以法蓮:
<p>以法蓮哪！我怎能捨棄你？以色列啊！我怎能棄絕你？我怎能使你如押瑪？怎能使你如洗扁(<a href="3927/hosea_11_8.htm">何西阿書11:8</a>)？因為在『何西阿書』中, 先知何西阿從第一章到最後一章論及的就是對聖言純正真理的歪曲, 並因而對教會的毀壞。又因為"行淫"表示對教會之中真理的歪曲, 於是這位先知被命令來代表教會如此的狀態, 被要求去為自己娶妓女為妻, 並和她生孩子(何西阿書 1章); 還去愛一個淫婦(何西阿書 3章)。引用這些經文的內容, 是為了從聖言來說明並證實, 教會取決於其中對聖言的理解如何:如果從聖言的理解中領受了純正真理, 教會則卓越和寶貴; 若是歪曲真理, 則被摧毀,甚至污穢了。 </p>

<p>
247. Many passages in the Prophets show that the church among the Israelite and Jewish nation was completely destroyed and was no longer a church because its members had falsified the meaning, or their understanding, of the Word. Nothing else destroys a church.
<p>In the Prophets, especially in Hosea, the name "Ephraim" stands for an understanding of the Word, whether true or false. Throughout the Word, in fact, "Ephraim" means the church's understanding of the Word. Because an understanding of the Word forms the church, Ephraim is called a precious child and one born of delight (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_20.htm">Jeremiah 31:20</a>); a firstborn (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>); the strength of Jehovah's head (<a href="3927/psalms_60_7.htm">Psalms 60:7</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_108_8.htm">108:8</a>); powerful (<a href="3927/zechariah_10_7.htm">Zechariah 10:7</a>); and someone outfitted with a bow (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_13.htm">Zechariah 9:13</a>); and Ephraim's children are said to be armed and to shoot with a bow (<a href="3927/psalms_78_9.htm">Psalms 78:9</a>). A "bow" means a body of teaching from the Word that fights against false ideas. For this reason Israel laid his right hand rather than his left on Ephraim and blessed him, and Ephraim took the place of Reuben (<a href="3927/genesis_48_5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>, <a href="3927/genesis_48_11.htm">11</a>, and following). For this reason during Moses' blessing of the children of Israel, Ephraim and his brother Manasseh were exalted above all the rest as part of Moses' blessing of their father, Joseph ().
</p>
<p>
[2] The Prophets, especially Hosea, also describe as "Ephraim" what the church is like when it has lost its understanding of the Word. For example,
<p>Israel and Ephraim will collapse. Ephraim will be desolate. Ephraim will be oppressed and broken in judgment. (<a href="3927/hosea_5_5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_5_9.htm">9</a>, )
<p>What will I do to you, Ephraim, since your holiness has gone away like a cloud at sunrise and like the dew that falls in the morning? (<a href="3927/hosea_6_4.htm">Hosea 6:4</a>)
<p>They will not live on Jehovah's land. Ephraim will go back to Egypt and will eat what is unclean in Assyria. (<a href="3927/hosea_9_3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>)
<p>"Jehovah's land" is the church; "Egypt" is scholarly study on the part of our earthly self; "Assyria" is reasoning based on that study. The latter two things together falsify our deeper understanding of the Word. This is why it says that Ephraim will go back to Egypt and eat what is unclean in Assyria.
</p>
<p>
[3] Ephraim is feeding on the wind and pursuing the east wind. Every day he increases lying and devastation. He is making a pact with Assyria and oil is being carried down to Egypt. (<a href="3927/hosea_12_1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>)
<p>"Feeding on the wind," "pursuing the east wind," and "increasing lying and devastation" means falsifying truths and thereby destroying the church.
<p>Ephraim's whoring means the same thing, in that "whoring" in the following passages means falsifying an understanding of the Word and its genuine truth:
<p>I know that Ephraim has whored in every way and Israel has become defiled. (<a href="3927/hosea_5_3.htm">Hosea 5:3</a>)
<p>In the house of Israel, I have seen a foul thing. Ephraim has whored there and Israel has become defiled. (<a href="3927/hosea_6_10.htm">Hosea 6:10</a>)
<p>"Israel" is the church itself; "Ephraim" is the understanding of the Word on which the church depends and is based. This is why it says that Ephraim whored and Israel became defiled.
</p>
<p>
[4] Since the church in the Israelite and Jewish nation was obviously destroyed by falsifying the Word, therefore we read of Ephraim,
<p>I will give you away, Ephraim. I will hand you over, Israel, like Admah, and I will make you like Zeboiim. (<a href="3927/hosea_11_8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>)
<p>Because the prophet Hosea from the first chapter to the last is about a genuine understanding of the Word becoming falsified and the church being destroyed by that, and because "whoring" there means falsifying the truth, therefore the prophet Hosea was commanded to represent the condition of the church by marrying a whore and having sons by her (Hosea 1); and later by marrying an adulterous woman (Hosea 3).
<p>I have quoted these passages to make known, and to support the concept, that the quality of the church is the quality of its understanding of the Word. If its understanding is based on genuine truths from the Word, the church is excellent and highly valuable. If its understanding is based on falsified truths from the Word, the church is ruined and in fact becomes something foul. </p>

<p>
247. There are many passages in the prophets describing how the church among the Israelite or Jewish race was utterly destroyed and annihilated by their falsifying the meaning or understanding of the Word; for it is this and nothing else which destroys a church. The understanding of the Word, both true and false, is described in the prophets, especially Hosea, by Ephraim; for this name stands in the Word for the understanding of the Word in the church. Since the understanding of the Word makes the church, Ephraim is called the precious son and the child of delight (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_20.htm">Jeremiah 31:20</a>); the first-born (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>); the strength of Jehovah's head (<a href="3927/psalms_60_7.htm">Psalms 60:7</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_108_8.htm">108:8</a>); the powerful one (<a href="3927/zechariah_10_7.htm">Zechariah 10:7</a>); the one armed with the bow (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_13.htm">Zechariah 9:13</a>). The sons of Ephraim are called armed men and shooters of the bow (<a href="3927/psalms_78_9.htm">Psalms 78:9</a>); for a bow means doctrine from the Word militating against falsities. For the same reason too Ephraim was transferred to Israel's right hand and blessed, and also received in place of Reuben <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
(<a href="3927/genesis_48_5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>, <a href="3927/genesis_48_11.htm">11</a>ff). Also Ephraim with his brother Manasseh was raised above all others by Moses when he blessed the sons of Israel in the name of Joseph their father (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13-17</a>).</p>
<p>
[2] What the church, however, is like when its understanding of the Word is destroyed is also described by Ephraim in the prophets, especially in Hosea, as in the following passages:<p>Israel and Ephraim will fall; Ephraim will become a wilderness. Ephraim is overwhelmed and shaken in judgment, <a href="3927/hosea_5_5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_5_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_5_11.htm">11-14</a>.<p>What shall I do to you, Ephraim? For your holiness has departed, like the clouds of dawn and like the dew that falls in the morning, <a href="3927/hosea_6_4.htm">Hosea 6:4</a>.<p>They will not dwell in the land of Jehovah; Ephraim will return to Egypt, and will eat unclean food in Assyria, <a href="3927/hosea_9_3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>.<p>The land of Jehovah is the church; Egypt is the factual knowledge of the natural man; Assyria is reasoning from this. It is these two together which lead to falsification of the Word in respect of its inward understanding. This is why it is said that Ephraim will return to Egypt and eat unclean food in Assyria.</p>
<p>
[3] Ephraim pastures the wind and pursues the east wind; every day he increases the lie and devastation; he makes an agreement with Assyria and oil is carried down into Egypt, <a href="3927/hosea_12_1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>.<p>Pasturing the wind, pursuing the east wind and increasing the lie and devastation is falsifying truths and so destroying the church. Ephraim's whoring has a similar meaning, as whoring means the falsification of the understanding of the Word, that is, of its genuine truth, in the following passages:<p>I know Ephraim, that he has utterly given himself to whoring, and Israel is defiled, <a href="3927/hosea_5_3.htm">Hosea 5:3</a>.<p>In the house of Israel I have seen a foul thing; there Ephraim went whoring and Israel is defiled, <a href="3927/hosea_6_10.htm">Hosea 6:10</a>.<p>Israel is the church itself, and Ephraim is the understanding of the Word, the source which determines what sort of church it is. This is why it says that Ephraim went whoring and Israel is defiled.</p>
<p>
[4] The church among the Israelite and Jewish people was utterly destroyed by falsifying the Word, so therefore it is said of Ephraim:<p>I shall give you up, Ephraim, I shall hand you over, Israel, like Admah and I shall make you like Zeboyim, <a href="3927/hosea_11_8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>.<p>So because the book of the prophet Hosea from the first chapter to the last is about the falsification of the genuine understanding of the Word and the resultant destruction of the church, and because whoring there means the falsification of truth, that is why the prophet was ordered to represent that state of the church by taking to wife a whore and having sons by her (chapter 1), and again by taking an adulterous woman (chapter 3).<p>These passages have been quoted to provide knowledge and proof from the Word that what the church is like depends on how the Word is understood in it. It is excellent and valuable, if its understanding is based upon genuine truths from the Word, but ruined and actually foul, if based upon falsified truths.<p>

<p>
247. In many places in the prophets the church with the Israelitish and Jewish nation is described as wholly destroyed and reduced to nothing by their having falsified the meaning or understanding of the Word; for nothing else destroys a church. The understanding of the Word both true and false is described in the Prophets by "Ephraim," especially in Hosea; for in the Word "Ephraim" signifies the understanding of the Word in the church. As the understanding of the Word constitutes the church, Ephraim is called: <p>A dear son and a pleasant child (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_20.htm">Jeremiah 31:20</a>); <p>The firstborn (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>); <p>The strength of the head of Jehovah (<a href="3927/psalms_60_7.htm">Psalms 60:7</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_108_8.htm">108:8</a>); <p>Mighty (<a href="3927/zechariah_10_7.htm">Zechariah 10:7</a>); <p>Filled with a bow (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_13.htm">Zechariah 9:13</a>); <p>and the sons of Ephraim are said to be, <p>Armed and shooters with the bow (<a href="3927/psalms_78_9.htm">Psalms 78:9</a>); <p>for a bow signifies doctrine from the Word fighting against falsities. Therefore also, <p>Ephraim was transferred to Israel's right hand, and blessed; and was accepted in the place of Reuben (<a href="3927/genesis_48_5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>, <a href="3927/genesis_48_11.htm">11</a>); <p>and therefore, Ephraim, with his brother Manasseh, in the blessing of the sons of Israel by Moses, under the name of their father Joseph, was exalted above them all (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13-17</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] But what the church is when the understanding of the Word is destroyed, is also depicted in the Prophets by "Ephraim," especially in Hosea, as in the following passages: <p>Israel and Ephraim shall fall; Ephraim shall become a desolation; Ephraim is oppressed and crushed of judgment (<a href="3927/hosea_5_5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_5_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_5_11.htm">11-14</a>). <p>O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? for your mercy is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away (<a href="3927/hosea_6_4.htm">Hosea 6:4</a>). <p>They shall not dwell in the land of Jehovah; but Ephraim shall return into Egypt, and shall eat what is unclean in Assyria (<a href="3927/hosea_9_3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>). <p>"The land of Jehovah" is the church; "Egypt" is the knowing faculty of the natural man; "Assyria" is reasoning therefrom; and these two together falsify the interior understanding of the Word; therefore it is said that "Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and shall eat what is unclean in Assyria."
</p>
<p>
[3] Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind; he daily multiplieth lies and destruction; they make a covenant with Assyria and oil is carried into Egypt (<a href="3927/hosea_12_1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>). <p>"To feed upon the wind," "to follow after the east wind," and "to multiply lies and destruction," is to falsify truths and thus destroy the church. "Ephraim's whoredom" has a like signification, since "whoredom" signifies falsification of the understanding of the Word, that is, of its genuine truth; as in the following: <p>I have known Ephraim; that he hath surely committed whoredom, and Israel is defiled (<a href="3927/hosea_5_3.htm">Hosea 5:3</a>). <p>I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel; there Ephraim hath committed whoredom and Israel hath become defiled (<a href="3927/hosea_6_10.htm">Hosea 6:10</a>). <p>Israel is the church itself, and Ephraim is the understanding of the Word, from which and according to which is the church; therefore it is said "Ephraim hath committed whoredom, and Israel is defiled."
</p>
<p>
[4] As the church with the Israelitish and Jewish nation became wholly destroyed by falsifications of the Word, it is said of Ephraim: <p>I must give thee up, Ephraim. I must deliver thee, Israel. I must make thee as Admah. I must set thee as Zeboim (<a href="3927/hosea_11_8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>). <p>Since then the prophet Hosea, from the first chapter to the last, treats of the falsification of the genuine understanding of the Word, and the destruction of the church thereby; and since "whoredom" signifies falsification of truth therein; that prophet was commanded to represent this state of the church by, <p>Taking a harlot to himself for a wife, and begetting children by her (Hosea<a href="3927/hosea_1_1.htm">1:1</a> and again by, <p>Taking a woman who was an adulteress (Hosea<a href="3927/hosea_3_1.htm">3:1</a> <p>These passages are presented in order to show and prove from the Word, that the church is such as is the understanding of the Word in it; excellent and precious if the understanding of it is from genuine truths out of the Word; but destroyed and even filthy if from truths falsified. </p>

247. The Prophets in many passages describe the Church among the Israelitish and Jewish nation as totally destroyed and annihilated, because they falsified the meaning or understanding of the Word: for nothing else destroys the Church. The understanding of the Word, both true and false, is described in the Prophets, particularly in Hosea, by Ephraim; for the understanding of the Word in the Church is signified in the Word by Ephraim. Since the understanding of the Word constitutes the Church, therefore Ephraim is called a "dear son" and "a pleasant child" <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_20.htm">Jeremiah 31:20</a>;<p>the "first-born," <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>;<p>"the strength of the head of Jehovah," <a href="3927/psalms_60_7.htm">Psalms 60:7</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_108_8.htm">108:8</a>;<p>"a mighty man" <a href="3927/zechariah_10_7.htm">Zechariah 10:7</a>;<p>"filled with the bow," <a href="3927/zechariah_9_13.htm">Zechariah 9:13</a>;<p>The sons of Ephraim are called "armed, and shooters with the bow" <a href="3927/psalms_78_9.htm">Psalms 78:9</a>;<p>for a bow signifies doctrine from the Word fighting against falsities. For the same reason also Ephraim was transferred to Israel's right hand, and blessed; and accepted in place of Reuben, <a href="3927/genesis_48_5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>, <a href="3927/genesis_48_11.htm">11</a>, and following verses.<p>For the same reason also Ephraim with his brother Manasseh, under the name of their father Joseph, was exalted above all the rest by Moses in his blessing of the children of Israel. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13-17</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] The nature of the Church when the understanding of the Word is destroyed is also described in the Prophets by Ephraim, particularly in Hosea; as in the following passages:<p>"Israel and Ephraim shall fall together... Ephraim shall be desolate... Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment" <a href="3927/hosea_5_5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_5_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_5_11.htm">11-14</a>.<p>"O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee?... for your holiness (A.V., goodness), is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away" <a href="3927/hosea_6_4.htm">Hosea 6:4</a>.<p>"They shall not dwell in the land of JEHOVAH; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and shall eat an unclean thing in Assyria" <a href="3927/hosea_9_3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>.<p>The land of Jehovah is the Church; Egypt is the scientific principle of the natural man, and Assyria is reasoning therefrom; by these two the Word as to its interior understanding is falsified, and therefore it is said that Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and shall eat an unclean thing in Assyria.</p>
<p>
[3] "Ephraim feedeth on wind and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and he maketh (A.V., they do make) a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt" <a href="3927/hosea_12_1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>.<p>To feed on wind, to follow after the east wind, and to increase lies and desolation, is to falsify truths, and so to destroy the Church. The same is also signified by the whoredom of Ephraim; for whoredom signifies the falsification of the understanding of the Word, that is, of its genuine truth, as in these passages:<p>"I know Ephraim... he has altogether committed (A.V., thou committest) whoredom, and Israel is defiled" <a href="3927/hosea_5_3.htm">Hosea 5:3</a><p>"I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, and Israel is defiled" <a href="3927/hosea_6_10.htm">Hosea 6:10</a>.<p>Israel is the Church itself, and Ephraim, the understanding of the Word, from which and according to which the Church exists; therefore it is said that Ephraim commits whoredom, and Israel is defiled.</p>
<p>
[4] As the Church among the people of Israel and Judah was totally destroyed by falsifications of the Word, it is said of Ephraim,<p>"I will (A.V., How shall I) give thee up, Ephraim, I will deliver thee up, Israel, I will make thee as Admah, I will set thee as Zeboim" <a href="3927/hosea_11_8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>.<p>Now since the Prophet Hosea, from the first chapter to the last, treats of the falsification of the genuine understanding of the Word, and the consequent destruction of the Church, and since by whoredom is signified the falsification of truth in the Word, therefore he was commanded to represent this state of the Church,<p>by taking a harlot for his wife, and begetting children by her. <a href="3927/hosea_3_1.htm">Hosea 3</a>.<p>and again by taking a woman who was an adultress. <a href="3927/hosea_3_1.htm">Hosea 3</a>.<p>These passages are quoted that it may be known and proved from the Word that the quality of the Church is according to its understanding of the Word; excellent and precious if its understanding is founded on genuine truths from the Word, but ruined and defiled if founded on truths falsified. </p>

247. Multis in locis apud Prophetas describitur Ecclesia apud Gentem Israeliticam et Judaicam, quod prorsus destructa et nulla facta sit per id, quod Sensum seu Intellectum Verbi falsificaverint; nam aliud non destruit Ecclesiam. Intellectus Verbi, tam verus quam falsus, describitur apud Prophetas per EPHRAIMUM, imprimis apud Hoscheam, nam per Ephraimum in Verbo significatur intellectus Verbi in Ecclesia. Quoniam intellectus Verbi facit Ecclesiam, ideo Ephraim vocatur FILIUS PRETIOSUS, et NATUS DELICIARUM, <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_20.htm">Jeremias 31:20</a>, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
PRIMOGENITUS, <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_9.htm">Jeremias 31:9</a>; <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>

Ideo etiam Ephraim ad dextram Israelis translatus est, et benedictus; tum loco Rubenis acceptatus <sup "fn120_5">5</sup>
est, <a href="3927/genesis_48_5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>, <a href="3927/genesis_48_11.htm">11</a>, seq. <sup "fn120_6">6</sup>
Et ideo, Ephraim cum fratre suo Menasse a Mose in Benedictione filiorum Israelis sub nomine Josephi patris illorum supra omnes exaltatus est, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_13.htm">Deuteronomius 33:13-17</a>. <sup "fn120_7">7</sup>
</p>
<p>
[2] Qualis autem Ecclesia est, quando intellectus Verbi est deperditus, per Ephraimum apud Prophetas etiam describitur, imprimis apud Hoscheam; ut in his, Israel et Ephraim corruent. Ephraim in solitudinem erit. Ephraim oppressus et concussus judicii, <a href="3927/hosea_5_5.htm">Hoschea 5:5</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_5_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_5_11.htm">11-14</a>. Quid faciam tibi Ephraim, quia sanctitas tua sicut nubes aurorae, et sicut ros mane cadens, abit, <a href="3927/hosea_6_4.htm">Hoschea 6:4</a>. Non habitabunt in terra Jehovae, revertetur Ephraim in Aegyptum, et in Assyria immundum comedent, <sup "fn120_8">8</sup>
<a href="3927/hosea_9_3.htm">Hoschea 9:3</a> terra Jehovae est Ecclesia, Aegyptus est scientificum naturalis hominis; Assyria est ratiocinatio inde, ex quibus duobus simul Verbum quoad intellectum ejus interiorem falsificatur; ideo dicitur quod Ephraim in Aegyptum revertetur, et in Assyria immundum comedent. <sup "fn120_9">9</sup>
</p>
<p>
[3] Ephraim pascens ventum, et persequitur eurum; omni die mendacium et vastationem multiplicat; foedus cum Assyria pangit, et oleum in Aegyptum defertur, <a href="3927/hosea_12_2.htm">Hoschea 12:2</a>, <sup "fn120_10">10</sup>
pascere ventum, persequi eurum, ac multiplicare mendacium et vastationem, est falsificare vera, et sic destruere Ecclesiam. Simile etiam significatur per scortationem Ephraimi, nam scortatio significat falsificationem intellectus Verbi, hoc est, genuini veri ejus; in his, "Ego novi Ephraimum, quod omnino scortatus sit, et pollutus sit Israel, <a href="3927/hosea_5_3.htm">Hoschea 5:3</a>. In domo Israelis vidi rem foedam, ibi scortatus est Ephraim, et pollutus est Israel," <a href="3927/hosea_6_10.htm">Hoschea 6:10</a>, Israel est ipsa Ecclesia, et Ephraim est intellectus Verbi, ex quo et secundum quem est Ecclesia; quare dicitur, scortatus est Ephraim, et pollutus est Israel.</p>
<p>
[4] Quoniam Ecclesia apud Gentem Israeliticam et Judaicam per falsificationes Verbi plane destructa fuit, ideo de Ephraimo dicitur, Dabo te Ephraim, tradam te Israel, sicut Adamam, et ponam te sicut Zeboim, <a href="3927/hosea_11_8.htm">Hoschea 11:8</a>.<p>Nunc quia apud Prophetam Hoscheam a Primo Capite ad Ultimum de Falsificatione genuini intellectus Verbi, et de destructione Ecclesiae per illam, et quia per scortationem significatur falsificatio veri ibi, ideo mandatum est illi Prophetae, ut repraesentaret illum statum Ecclesiae, per quod acciperet sibi Scortum in Uxorem, et ex illa gigneret filios, Cap. <a href="3927/hosea_1_1.htm">1</a> ac iterum, ut acciperet Mulierem adulteram, Cap. <a href="3927/hosea_3_1.htm">3</a>. Haec allata sunt, ut ex Verbo sciatur et confirmetur, quod Ecclesia talis sit, qualis est intellectus Verbi in illa, praestans et pretiosa, si intellectus sit ex genuinis veris ex Verbo, at destructa, imo foeda, si ex falsificatis.<p>
