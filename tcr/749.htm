749. After that, the angel guide went over to the six young women and told them, too, about his group of visitors. He asked if they would be willing to visit with his group.
<p>The young women agreed and started in the direction of the group, but when they came close they suddenly turned around and walked off instead into a sitting room for women, where their female friends were spending time. The angel guide saw this unfold and went after them. He asked them, "Why did you suddenly leave without even speaking to my group?"
<p>"We couldn't go near them," they replied.
<p>"Why not?" the angel asked.
<p>"We don't know; but we sensed something that refused to let us go further and turned us instead in the opposite direction. We hope they can forgive us. "
<p>The angel went over to his group and told them what the young women had said. He added, "My guess is that your love for the opposite sex is not chaste. In heaven we love young women for their beauty and moral refinement; we love them intensely, but chastely. "
<p>The group laughed and said, "Your guess is entirely correct! Who can see women who are that beautiful just a few feet away and not feel any desire?" </p>

749. After this the angel guide approached the six maidens and telling them too about his companions, asked them to be kind enough to spend some time with them. So they came towards them, but when they were close, they suddenly turned away and went into the women's quarters, where their maiden friends were too. On seeing this the angel guide went after them and asked why they had suddenly turned away without speaking to the guests. 'We were unable to come close,' they replied. 'Why so?' he asked. 'We do not know,' they answered, 'but we became aware of something repelling and drawing us back. Please forgive us.'<p>So the angel went back to his companions and told them the answer he had received; and he added: 'I suspect your attraction to the opposite sex is not chaste. In heaven we love maidens for their beauty and the elegance of their manners; we love them very dearly, but in a chaste manner.' His companions laughed at this, and said: 'Your suspicions are well founded. Can anyone see such beauties close at hand without some feeling of desire?' </p>

749. After this the angel guide went to the six virgins and told them also about his companions, and besought them to honor the visitors with their company. And they approached them; but when they came near they suddenly turned back and entered the woman's apartment where their virgin friends were. <p>Seeing this, the angel guide followed them and asked why they turned back so suddenly without speaking to the visitors; and they replied, "We could not go near them." He asked why; and they said, "We do not know; but we perceived something that repelled and drove us back; we beg pardon." <p>The angel turned to his companions and told them the reply, adding, "I suspect that your love of the sex is not chaste; in heaven we love virgins for their beauty and the elegance of their manners; and we love them intensely but chastely." His companions laughed at this, and said, "Your suspicion is correct; who can see such beauties near and not feel some desire?" </p>

749. After this the angel guide went to the six maidens and told them also of his companions, and requested that they should honor them with their company. So they approached; but as they came near, they suddenly drew back and entered the inner part of the house, where their maiden friends were. On seeing this the angel followed them, and asked them why they retired so suddenly without conversing with the strangers. They replied: "We could not approach them." "Why not?" he asked; and they answered: "We do not know; we just perceived something that repelled us, and drove us back; they must excuse us." The angel returned to his companions and told them this, adding: "I surmise your love of the sex is not chaste. In heaven we love maidens for their beauty and elegant manners; and we love them intensely, but chastely." At this his companions smiled, and said, "You surmise aright; who can behold such beauty close at hand and not feel his desires being stirred?" </p>

749. Post haec Angelus ductor accessit ad sex Virgines, et quoque narravit illis de comitibus suis, et petiit, ut dignarentur illos suo consortio; et accesserunt, sed cum prope erant, subito recesserunt, et ingressae sunt gynaeceum, ubi etiam virgines amicae illarum erant: hoc viso, Angelus ductor sequutus est illas, et quaesivit, cur absque loquendo cum illis tam subito recesserint; et responderunt, non potuimus appropinquare, et dixit, cur hoc, et responderunt, non scimus, sed percepimus aliquid quod repulit et retroduxit nos, ignoscant: et Angelus rediit ad suos comites, et dixit responsum, et addidit, auguror quod vobis non sit amor sexus castus; in Coelo amamus virgines ex illarum pulchritudine et elegantia morum, et impense amamus illas, sed caste; ad hoc riserunt ejus comites, et dixerunt, recte auguraris; quis potis est videre tales pulchritudines prope, et non aliquid cupere. </p>
