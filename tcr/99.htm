<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>99</b>.这种合一是相互的，这一点从以下圣言经文明显看出来：<br />腓力，你不信我在父里面，父在我里面吗？你们当信我，我在父里面，父在我里面。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.10.htm">约翰福音14:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>）<br />叫你们知道并相信，父在我里面，我在父里面。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.36.htm">约翰福音10:36</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.38.htm">38</a>）<br />使他们都合而为一。正如你，父，在我里面，我在你里面。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.21.htm">约翰福音17:21</a>）<br />父，凡是我的，都是你的；凡是你的，都是我的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.10.htm">约翰福音17:10</a>）<br />这种合一是相互的，因为若非彼此相互靠近，两个人之间的结合或联结是不可能的。在整个天堂，整个世界，整个人里面，一切结合都源于彼此的相互靠近，各自都愿与对方成为一体。这在两边的一切细节中都会产生相似和同感，以及和谐一致。这就是每个人里面灵魂与身体之间的相互结合；这就是人的灵与他的身体感觉、运动器官之间的结合；这就是心与肺之间的结合；这就是意愿与觉知之间的结合；这就是人体的一切肢体与肺腑本身，以及彼此之间的结合；这就是彼此恩爱的所有人心与心之间的结合。这种结合被铭刻在一切爱与友情之上，因为爱渴望去爱和被爱。世上彼此完全结合的一切事物之间都存在一种相互结合。太阳的热与木头或石块的热之间，生命之热与活物的一切纤维之热之间存在类似结合。土壤与根系，并经由根系与树木，再经由树木与果实之间存在类似结合；磁铁与铁块之间也存在类似结合等等。结合若非通过彼此的这种相互共同靠近实现，只不过是外在的，而非内在的。这种结合迟早会自动解体，有时他们甚至不再认识彼此。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #99 </h4>
<p>
99. 如此聯合, 是相互的, 從以下聖言可顯然看出:腓力, 你不相信我在父裡面, 父在我裡面嗎？相信我:我在父裡面, 父在我裡面(<a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">約翰福音14:10-11</a>)。你們當知道並相信:父在我裡面, 我在父裡面 (<a href="3927/john_10_38.htm">約翰福音10:38</a>) 。使全部為一, 正如你, 父, 在我裡面, 我在你裡面(<a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">約翰福音17:21</a>)。父, 凡是我的, 都是你的; 凡是你的, 都是我的(<a href="3927/john_17_10.htm">約翰福音17:10</a>)。
<p>這樣的聯合是相互的, 因為沒有哪種聯合關係, 不是存在於一方向另一方接近。整個天國,全世界及所有人類之中, 任何一種聯合關係都歸功於雙方逐漸互相接近,直到雙方專注於相同事物; 最後導致雙方在所有細節方面的類似,協調,一致與認同。
<p>這就是我們靈魂與身體如何彼此形成一種聯合的關係, 就是我們的精神如何與感覺和運動器官形成一種聯合的關係。心與肺如此; 我們的意志與認知如此; 我們的肢體,組織與臟器, 各自本身以及彼此之間都是如此。彼此深愛之人的思想也是如此, 刻寫在各種愛情與友情之上。愛期盼去愛,也期盼被愛。
<p>這世上, 彼此相連不分的事物, 都有這種相互作用的關係。類似的相關事物, 例如太陽的熱, 與一塊木片或石頭之熱; 又或土地與根,通過根而與樹,通過樹而與果實的相互作用; 類似的相連事物還有磁石與鐵, 等等。
<p>倘若不是通過雙方相互和彼此接近而產生聯合, 僅僅是外在,而非內在的聯合, 遲早會分道揚鑣, 甚至有時彼此不再彼此相認。 </p>

99. This union is also reciprocal, as the following passages in the Word clearly show:
<p>Philip, do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. (<a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">John 14:10-11</a>)
<p>So that you will know and believe that the Father is in me and I am in the Father. (<a href="3927/john_10_38.htm">John 10:38</a>)
<p>So that all may be one as you, Father, are in me and I am in you. (<a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">John 17:21</a>)
<p>Father, all that is mine is yours, and all that is yours is mine. (<a href="3927/john_17_10.htm">John 17:10</a>)
<p>The union is reciprocal because no union or partnership between two exists unless each party moves closer to the other. Every partnership in the entirety of heaven, in all the world, and throughout the human form is the result of two parties moving into a closer relationship with each other until both parties intend the same things. This leads to a similarity, harmony, unanimity, and agreement in every detail between the parties.
<p>This is how our soul and our body form a partnership with each other. This is how our spirit forms a partnership with the sensory and motor organs of our body. This is how our heart and our lungs form a partnership. This is how our will and our intellect form a partnership. This is how all our parts and organs form partnerships, both within themselves and with each other. This is how the minds of people who deeply love each other form a partnership. It is an integral part of all love and friendship. Love wants to love and it wants to be loved.
<p>In the world, too, all things that are inseparably linked to each other have a reciprocal interaction. There is an interaction like this between the heat of the sun and the heat in a piece of wood or a rock, and in living things between their vital heat and the heat in all their tissues. There is a similar interaction between the earth and a root, through the root with the tree, and through the tree with the fruit. Also like this is the relationship of a magnet to a piece of iron, and so on.
<p>If a given partnership is not the result of two things moving closer to each other in a mutual and reciprocal way, then a partnership develops that is only superficial rather than deep. In time, the partners in a superficial relationship drift away from each other, sometimes so far that they no longer recognize each other. </p>

99. This union is reciprocal, as is clearly established by the following passages in the Word:<p>Philip, do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? Believe me, I am in the Father and the Father is in me, <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">John 14:10-11</a> That you may know and believe, that the Father is in me and I in the Father, <a href="3927/john_10_36.htm">John 10:36</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_38.htm">38</a>, That all may be one, as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, <a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">John 17:21</a>.<p>Father, all that is mine is yours, and all that is yours is mine, <a href="3927/john_17_10.htm">John 17:10</a>.<p>The union is reciprocal, because no union or link is possible between two people unless each approaches the other. Every link throughout heaven, throughout the world and in the whole human personality, is entirely due to the reciprocal approach of each to the other, leading to a mutual identity of will. This produces similarity and sympathy, unanimity and agreement in every detail on each side.</p>
<p>
[2] Such is the reciprocal link between soul and body in each individual; such is the link between a person's spirit and the sensory and motor organs of his body; such is the link between the heart and the lungs; such is the link between the will and the understanding; such is the link between all the members and viscera of the human body in themselves and with each other; such is the link between the minds of all who love each other deeply, for it is engraved upon every form of love and friendship, since love wants to love and be loved. There is a reciprocal link between all the things in the world which are indissolubly joined. There is a similar link between the heat of the sun and the heat of wood or stone, between the vital heat and the heat of all the fibres of living creatures. There is a similar link between the ground <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
and the root, and through the root with the tree, and through the tree with the fruit; there is a similar link between the magnet and the iron, and so on. If the link were not produced by a reciprocal and mutual approach of one to the other, it would be merely an outward and not an inward linking; and this in time falls apart of itself, sometimes so that the partners no longer recognise each other.<p>

99. That this union is reciprocal is clearly evident from the following passages in the Word: <p>Philip, believest thou not that I am in the Father and the Father in Me? Believe Me, that I am in the Father and the Father in Me (<a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">John 14:10, 11</a>). <p>That ye may know and believe that the Father is in Me and I in the Father (<a href="3927/john_10_36.htm">John 10:36</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_38.htm">38</a>). <p>That they all may be one, as Thou, Father, art in Me and I in Thee (<a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">John 17:21</a>). <p>Father, all things that are Mine are Thine, and all things that are Thine are Mine (<a href="3927/john_17_10.htm">John 17:10</a>). <p>The union is reciprocal, because no union or conjunction between two persons is possible unless each in turn approached the other. In the whole heaven, and in the whole world, and in the entire man, all conjunction has its source in the reciprocal approach of one to another, each then willing in oneness with the other. From this comes homogeneity and sympathy, also unanimity and concord, in every particular of each. In every man there is such a reciprocal conjunction of soul and body; such is the conjunction of the spirit of man with the sensory and motor organs of his body; such is the conjunction of the heart and the lungs; such is the conjunction of the will and the understanding; such is the conjunction in man of all the members and viscera in themselves and with each other; the minds of all who interiorly love each other are so conjoined, for this conjunction is inscribed upon all love and friendship; since love desires to love and be loved. Of all things in the world that are fully conjoined one to the other there is a reciprocal conjunction. There is a like conjunction of the sun's heat with the heat of wood and mineral, of vital heat with the heat of all the fibers of animate things, of the soil with the root, through the root with the tree, and through the tree with the fruit; a like conjunction of the magnet with iron; and so on. Unless conjunction is effected by the reciprocal and mutual approach of one to another, no internal but only external conjunction is effected, and this in time is dissolved by mutual consent, sometimes even so far that they no longer recognize each other. </p>

99. That the union of the Father and the Son is reciprocal is clearly evident from these passages in the Word:<p>"Philip, believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?... Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me" <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">John 14:10-11</a>;<p>"That ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in Him" <a href="3927/john_10_38.htm">John 10:38</a>;<p>"That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee" <a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">John 17:21</a>;<p>"Father, all mine are thine, and thine are mine" <a href="3927/john_17_10.htm">John 17:10</a>.<p>The union is reciprocal, because there cannot be any union or conjunction between two, unless they mutually approach each other. All conjunction in the whole of heaven, in the whole of the world and in the whole of man arises solely from the reciprocal approach of one to the other, and consequently from the unity of will on both sides: hence arises homogeneity and sympathy, unanimity and concord in all particulars affecting each. Such is the reciprocal union of soul and body in every man; the union of man's spirit with the sensory and motor organs of the body; the union of the heart and lungs; the union of the will and the understanding; the union of all members and viscera in man, in themselves and with one another; the union of minds with all who interiorly love one another, for it is inscribed on all love and friendship, as it is the nature of love to desire to love and to be loved. There is reciprocal union of all things in the world that are perfectly united, as the union of the sun's heat with the heat of wood and stone, of vital heat with the heat of all fibres in living things; as the union of tree with the root, <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
through the root with the tree, and through the tree with the fruit; such is the union between the magnet and iron, and so on. Unless union arises from the reciprocal and mutual approach of one to the other it is only an external, and not an internal union, which in time is mutually dissolved, and sometimes so entirely that the parties no longer recognize one another.<p>

99. Quod Unio illa sit reciproca, constat clare ex his locis in Verbo, "Philippe, nonne credis, quod Ego in Patre, et Pater in Me sit: Credite Mihi, quod Ego in Patre, et Pater in Me sit, <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">Johannes 14:10-11</a>. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Ut cognoscatis et credatis, quod Pater in Me, et Ego in Patre, <a href="3927/john_10_36.htm">Johannes 10:36</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_38.htm">38</a>. Ut omnes unum sint, sicut Tu Pater in Me, et Ego in Te, <a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">Johannes 17:21</a>. Pater, Omnia Mea Tua sunt, et omnia Tua Mea," <a href="3927/john_17_10.htm">Johannes 17:10</a>. Quod Unio reciproca sit, est quia non datur aliqua Unio seu conjunctio inter duos, nisi unus ad alterum vicissim accedat; omnis Conjunctio in Universo Coelo, et in universo Mundo, et in toto homine, non aliunde est, quam ex reciproca accessione unius ad alterum, et tunc quod alter cum altero unum velit; inde fit homogeneum et sympathicum, ac unanimum et concors, in singulis utriusque;</p>
<p>
[2] talis conjunctio reciproca <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
est animae et corporis apud unumquemvis hominem; talis conjunctio est spiritus hominis cum organis sensoriis et motoriis ejus corporis; talis conjunctio est cordis et pulmonis; talis conjunctio est voluntatis et intellectus; talis conjunctio est omnium membrorum et viscerum in se et inter se, in homine; talis conjunctio mentium est inter omnes qui se interius amant, est enim illa omni amori et amicitiae inscripta, amor enim vult amare et vult amari. Reciproca conjunctio est omnium in Mundo, quae inter se sarte conjuncta sunt; similis conjunctio est caloris solis cum calore ligni et lapidis, caloris vitalis cum calore omnium fibrarum in animatis; similis est arboris <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
cum radice, per radicem cum arbore, et per arborem cum fructu; talis est magnetis cum ferro, et sic porro. Nisi conjunctio per accessionem unius ad alterum reciproce et vicissim fiat, non fit nisi externa conjunctio et non interna, et haec a se mutuo, tempore dilabitur, et quandoque ut se non amplius cognoscant.<p>
