<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>700</b>.关于这最神圣的圣礼，如今整个基督教界都持这种观点，只因他们赞同圣言字义；而圣餐的作用与好处唯独存在于灵义，只见于真理，这灵义一直被隐藏，现在才被揭示出来。这层含义现首次被揭示，其原因在于，此前的基督教徒有其名，仅在个别人身上留有它的影子。因为人们至今没有直接靠近和敬拜作为独一神（里面有神圣三位一体）的救主自己，而仅是间接靠近祂。这并不是靠近和敬拜，只是敬畏祂，因为祂是人得救的原因，但不是根本原因，而是在根本原因之下之外的间接原因。但由于真正的基督教现刚刚起步，启示录中新耶路撒冷所指的新教会正被主建立，其中圣父、圣子与圣灵被视为一体，因它们在一个身位里面，所以主乐意揭示圣言灵义，以便该教会能收获洗礼与圣餐这两项圣礼的真正好处。当人们以灵眼，即觉知看到隐藏在它们里面的神圣，并藉主在圣言中教我们的方法理解这种神圣时，这事就会实现。</p>

<h4 align="center">True Christianity #700 (Rose, 2010)
</h4>
<p>
700. The one and only reason why these types of ideas about this most holy sacrament are entertained throughout the Christian world today is that they accord with the literal meaning of the Word. Meanwhile its spiritual meaning lies hidden away and has not been disclosed until now. Yet the spiritual meaning alone reveals the true function and benefit of the Holy Supper.
<p>This meaning is being revealed now for the first time because Christianity did not exist before, except in name only (some people, though, did have at least a shadow of it). Until now people have not turned directly to or worshiped the Savior himself as the only God, the One in whom the divine Trinity exists. People have approached him only indirectly, which is not turning to him and worshiping him, but merely showing him respect on the grounds that he is why we have salvation. He is seen then not as the essential cause but merely as an intermediate cause that is below and outside the essential cause.
<p>Now, however, Christianity itself is arising for the first time. The Lord is now establishing the new church that is meant by the New Jerusalem in the Book of Revelation. In it, God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are acknowledged as one, because they are together in one person. Therefore the Lord is pleased to reveal the spiritual sense of the Word now, so that this new church will be able to come into the true benefit of the sacraments of baptism and the Holy Supper. This will happen as people come to see with the eyes of their spirit (meaning with understanding) the true holiness that lies hidden within the sacraments, and will embrace that holiness through the means that the Lord has taught in his Word. </p>

700. Such ideas about this most holy sacrament are cherished throughout Christendom at the present time, for the sole reason that they agree with the literal sense of the Word; and the spiritual sense has up to now been hidden, and has only been revealed at the present time, and it is only in this that the true benefit of the Holy Supper can be discerned. The reason why this sense has now been revealed for the first time is that Christianity did not before exist except in name, and in the case of some people as a kind of shadow of itself. For up to the present people have not approached directly and worshipped the Saviour Himself as the only God, in whom is the Divine Trinity, but have only approached Him indirectly. This is not approaching and worshipping, but only reverencing Him, as the cause on whose account man is saved, not the essential but an intermediate cause, which is below and outside the other.<p>But because real Christianity is now for the first time arising, the new church meant by the New Jerusalem in Revelation is now being established by the Lord; in this God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are acknowledged as one, because they are in one person. It has therefore pleased the Lord to reveal the spiritual sense of the Word, so that this church may reap the real benefit of the sacraments of baptism and the Holy Supper. This comes about when people see with the eyes of their spirit, that is, with the understanding, the holiness hidden within them, and grasp this holiness for themselves by the means which the Lord taught us to use in His Word. </p>

700. Such ideas respecting this most holy sacrament are at this day cherished throughout all Christendom, solely because they are in accord with the sense of the letter of the Word; while the spiritual sense in which alone the use and benefit of the holy supper are seen in their truth, has been hitherto hidden, not having been disclosed until the present time. The reason why this sense is now for the first time disclosed, is that heretofore Christianity has existed only in name, excepting some shadow of it in a few individuals; for heretofore men have not directly approached and worshiped the Savior Himself as the one only God in whom is the Divine Trinity, but only mediately, and this is not approaching and worshiping but merely venerating Him as the cause of man's salvation, not regarding Him, however, as the essential cause, but as the mediate cause which is beneath and exterior to the essential cause. But now, because real Christianity is beginning to dawn, and a New Church meant by the New Jerusalem in the Apocalypse, is now being established by the Lord, wherein God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are acknowledged as one, because in one Person, it has pleased the Lord to reveal the spiritual sense of the Word, to enable this church to enter into the real use and benefit of these sacraments, baptism and the holy supper; and this is done when men, with the eyes of the spirit, that is, with the understanding see the holiness that is concealed within them, and apply it to themselves by the means which the Lord has taught in His Word. </p>

700. Such ideas concerning this most holy sacrament are at this day entertained throughout all Christendom solely because they agree with the sense of the Letter of the Word; and the spiritual sense, in which alone the use and benefit of the Holy Supper is clearly seen in its truth, has been hitherto concealed, and has not been disclosed until the present time. This sense is now for the first time disclosed, because formerly Christianity has existed only in name, and with some, only as a kind of shadow. For hitherto men have not approached and worshipped the Savior Himself immediately, as the only God, in whom is the Divine Trinity, but only mediately; and this is not to approach and worship Him, but merely to venerate Him as the cause of salvation to men. This is not the essential but the mediate cause, which is below and apart from the essential cause.
<p>But for the first time Christianity itself is beginning to dawn, and a New Church, which is meant by the New Jerusalem in the Revelation, is now being established by the Lord, in which God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are acknowledged as one, because they are in one Person. It has, therefore, pleased the Lord to reveal the spiritual sense of the Word, in order that this Church may enter into the use and benefit itself of the two sacraments, Baptism and the Holy Supper. This follows when men see with the eyes of their spirit, that is, with the understanding, the holiness concealed therein, and apply it to themselves by the means which the Lord has taught in His Word. </p>

700. Tales ideae de Sanctissimo hoc Sacramento in toto Christianismo hodie foventur, unice, quia coincidunt cum sensu literae Verbi, et sensus spiritualis hactenus latuit, et non prius quam hodie detectus est, in quo solo usus fructus Sanctae Coenae conspicitur in sua veritate. Quod hic Sensus nunc primum detectus sit, est causa, quia non prius fuit Christianismus nisi nomine tenus, et apud quosdam aliqua umbra ejus; non enim hactenus immediate Ipsum Salvatorem, ut unicum Deum, in Quo Divina Trinitas est, adiverunt et coluerunt, sed solum mediate, quod non est adire et colere, sed modo venerari, ut causam propter quam homini est salus, quae non est causa essentialis sed media, quae est infra et extra illam. At vero quia nunc primum ipse Christianismus exoritur, Nova Ecclesia, quae per Novam Hierosolymam in Apocalypsi intelligitur, a Domino nunc instauratur, in qua Deus Pater, Filius et Spiritus Sanctus ut unum, quia in una Persona, agnoscuntur, placuit Domino revelare Sensum spiritualem Verbi, ut haec Ecclesia in ipsum usum fructum Sacramentorum, Baptismi et Sanctae Coenae, veniat, quod fit, cum vident oculis spiritus sui, hoc est, intellectu, Sanctitatem, quae inibi latet, et hanc sibi applicant per media, quae Dominus in Verbo suo docuit. </p>
