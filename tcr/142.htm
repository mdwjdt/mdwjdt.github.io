<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>142</b>.（2）一般来说，圣灵所表示的神性大能和活动是指改造和重生；改造和重生带来更新、复活、成圣和称义，而这些则带来从恶中洁净，使罪得赦，最终还带来救恩。这就是主在那些信祂、调整并使自己适合接受祂，让祂住在自己里面之人中所产生的一系列功效。这一切是凭着神圣真理来成就的，对基督徒来说，则是凭着圣言来成就的；这是让人靠近主，并让主进入人里面的唯一途径。因为如前所述，主是神圣真理本身，凡从祂发出的，皆为神圣真理。但必须明白，神圣真理通过良善起作用，正如信被仁所激发；因为信无非是真理，仁无非是良善。正是凭着通过良善起作用的神圣真理，换句话说，凭着仁所激发的信，人才得以改造、重生、更新、复活、成圣、称义，并根据这些的发展和增长而从恶中洁净；从恶中洁净就是使罪得赦。不过，要逐一解释主的所有这些行动是不可能的，因为每项行动都需要详细分析，既要通过圣言证实，又要理性说明，此处不宜展开论述。因此，读者可参阅本书下面的章节，它们依次论述了仁（392－462节）、信（336－391节）、自由选择（463－508节）、悔改（509－570节）、改造和重生（571－625节）。要知道，主在每个人里面不断实施这些救赎方法，因为它们是通向天堂的阶梯，主渴望拯救每个人。故每个人的得救都是主所关注的目的，意愿目的也会意愿方法。主的到来、救赎和十字架受难都是为了人的救赎（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.11.htm">马太福音18:11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.10.htm">路加福音19:10</a>）。由于人的救赎过去是，且永远都是主的目的，故可知，上述行动是居间目的，而救赎则是最终目的。</p>

142. (2)總體而言, 神性活動和強大作用表示藉著聖靈改造和更新我們的作為。依靠改造和更新的結果, 神性活動和強大作用還包括對我們的復興,啟動,成聖,稱義等作為。依靠這些依次的結果, 神性的活動和強大作用也包括淨化,赦罪,拯救我們等作為。
<p>這一系列的功效, 是主對一些人產生的效果, 就是信祂,並調整自己以適應去迎接祂住進他裡面之人。這要藉著神性之真理(聖理)來成就。對基督徒來說, 就是藉著聖言來成就, 因為對他們而言, 這是一種,且是唯一讓人去接近主,讓主進入人的途徑。正如先前所說, 因為主是聖理之本, 聖理是由祂發出的一切。不過要明白聖理因良善而啟發(理與善相連), 正如信由義而啟發(信與義相連)。沒有理, 信什麼都不是; 沒了善, 義什麼也不是。
<p>與善相連的聖理, 就是與義相連的信, 促使我們的改造和重生髮生作用, 並由此我們被更新,帶來我們生命,使我們成聖以及使我們為義。根據我們成長與前進的層次, 從惡中淨化我們(從惡中被淨化相當於我們的罪被赦免)。
<p>主的所有這些行動和作用無法一一解釋, 因為每一個都需要具體的分析,並引用聖言和例證來證實, 在處並不適合。讀者可以參照本書的接下來幾章的內容, 依次有詳細闡述:義(<a href="392.htm">392-462</a>),信(<a href="336.htm">336-391</a>),自由選擇(<a href="463.htm">463-508</a>),悔改(<a href="509.htm">509-570</a>),以及改造與更新(<a href="571.htm">571-625</a>)。
<p>當知道, 主持續地在每個人身上實施這些拯救的方法, 因為此法為通往天國的階梯, 主盼望拯救每個人。因此每個人得拯救是主的目標, 盼望實現目標, 也會盼望實現目標的方法得到施行。祂的降臨,救贖和十字架受難都是為了人的拯救(<a href="3927/matthew_18_11.htm">馬太福音18:11</a>;<a href="3927/luke_19_10.htm">路加福音19:10</a>)。因為人被拯救曾是,將永遠是祂的目標, 所以上述的各種行動和功效就是間接的目標, 拯救是終極的目標。 </p>

142. 2. Generally speaking, the divine actions and powerful effects meant by the Holy Spirit are the acts of reforming and regenerating us. Depending on the outcome of this reformation and regeneration, the divine actions and powerful effects also include the acts of renewing us, bringing us to life, sanctifying us, and making us just; and depending on the outcome of these in turn, the divine actions and powerful effects also include the acts of purifying us from evils, forgiving our sins, and ultimately saving us. These are the powerful effects, one after the other, that the Lord has on people who believe in him and who adapt and modify themselves in order to welcome him and invite him to stay. Divine truth has these effects. Among Christians the Word has these effects because the Word is the only means by which Christians can go to the Lord and the Lord can come to them. As I said before, the Lord is absolute divine truth; so is everything that emanates from him. It is important to take this to mean the divine truth in connection with goodness, which is the same as faith in connection with goodwill; faith is nothing but truth, and goodwill is nothing but goodness.
<p>The divine truth in connection with goodness, that is, faith in connection with goodwill, is the force that reforms and regenerates us; then renews us, brings us to life, sanctifies us, and justifies us; and, depending on our level of growth and forward movement, purifies us from evils. (Being purified from our evils is the same as having our sins forgiven.)
<p>All these actions of the Lord cannot be explained here one by one, however. Each one would need its own analysis with support from the Word and illustrative reasoning. This is not the place for that. The reader [who wishes to know more about them] should turn instead to the topics that come later in the book: goodwill [392-462], faith [336-391], free choice [463-508], repentance [509-570], and reformation and regeneration [571-625].
<p>It is important to know that the Lord is carrying out these salvation processes in every single one of us all the time. They are the steps to heaven. The Lord wants to save everyone; his purpose is to save all people. Anyone who has a purpose desires the means to achieve it. The Lord's coming, his redeeming humankind, and his suffering on the cross were for the sake of our salvation (<a href="3927/matthew_18_11.htm">Matthew 18:11</a>; <a href="3927/luke_19_10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>). Because saving people was his purpose and is his purpose forever, it follows that having the powerful effects on us that were just listed is his intermediate purpose, and saving us is his ultimate purpose. </p>

142. (ii) THE DIVINE POWER AND ACTIVITY MEANT BY THE HOLY SPIRIT ARE, GENERALLY SPEAKING, REFORMATION AND REGENERATION, WHICH LEAD TO RENEWAL, QUICKENING, SANCTIFICATION. AND JUSTIFICATION; AND THESE LEAD TO PURIFICATION FROM EVILS AND THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS, AND ULTIMATELY TO SALVATION.<p>This is the series of virtues which the Lord produces in those who believe in Him, adapting and making themselves suitable for Him to be received and dwell in them. This is done by means of the Divine truth, and in the case of Christians by the Word; for this is the one and only means which allows a person to approach the Lord, and allows the Lord to come in to him. For, as stated before, the Lord is Divine truth itself, and so is whatever proceeds from Him. But it must be understood as Divine truth acting from good, which is the same as faith inspired by charity; for faith is nothing but truth, and charity is nothing but good. It is by means of Divine truth acting from good, in other words by means of faith inspired by charity that a person's reformation and regeneration is effected, and by this means too he is renewed, quickened and made holy and righteous. As all these processes advance and increase, he is cleansed from evils, and this cleansing is what is meant by the forgiveness of sins.<p>All of these processes effected by the Lord cannot here be discussed one by one, because each demands its own particular analysis, which must be proved from the Word and have light shed on it by the faculty of reason, and this is not the place for it. The reader is therefore referred to the following chapters of this book, which will deal in turn with charity, faith, free will, repentance, reformation and regeneration. It should be known that the Lord continually effects these means of salvation in the case of each individual, for they are steps to heaven, and the Lord desires the salvation of everyone. Thus the salvation of everyone is the end the Lord has in view, and to will the end is to will the means. His coming, redeeming and passion on the cross were all for the sake of man's salvation (<a href="3927/matthew_18_11.htm">Matthew 18:11</a>; <a href="3927/luke_19_10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>). So because man's salvation was and ever will be His end, it follows that the various activities listed above are the mediate ends, and salvation is the ultimate end. </p>

142. (2) The Divine Energy and Operation, which are meant by the Holy Spirit, are, in general, reformation and regeneration; and in accordance with these, renovation, vivification, sanctification and justification; and in accordance with these latter, purification from evils, forgiveness of sins, and finally salvation. These in their order are the energies made operative by the Lord in those who believe in Him, and who adjust and dispose themselves for His reception and indwelling; and this is done by means of Divine truth, and with Christians by means of the Word; for the Word is the sole medium through which man draws near to the Lord, and into which the Lord enters. For, as said above, the Lord is Divine truth itself, and whatever goes forth from Him is Divine truth. But Divine truth from good must be understood, which is the same as faith from charity, since faith is nothing but truth, and charity is nothing but goodness. It is by means of Divine truth from good, that is, by means of faith from charity, that man is reformed and regenerated, and also renewed, vivified, sanctified, justified, and according to the progress and growth of these is purified from evils; and purification from evils is remission of sins. But these operations of the Lord cannot now be all explained one by one, because each one calls for its own analysis, confirmed by the Word and rationally illustrated, for which this not the place; therefore the reader is referred to the chapters following in order in this work, which treat of Charity, Faith, Free Will, Repentance, and Reformation and Regeneration. It must be understood that these saving graces are continually made operative by the Lord in every man; since they are the steps to heaven, and the Lord desires the salvation of all. Thus the salvation of all is His end; and he who wills an end wills also the means. The Lord's coming, redemption, and the passion of the cross were for the sake of man's salvation (<a href="3927/matthew_18_11.htm">Matthew 18:11</a>; <a href="3927/luke_19_10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>). And as man's salvation was and eternally is the Lord's end, it follows that the above mentioned operations are mediate ends, and salvation the final end. </p>

142. (2) THE DIVINE VIRTUE AND OPERATION, SIGNIFIED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT, CONSIST, IN GENERAL, IN REFORMATION AND REGENERATION; AND FOLLOWING UPON THESE, RENEWAL, VIVIFICATION, SANCTIFICATION AND JUSTIFICATION; AND FOLLOWING UPON THESE AGAIN, PURIFICATION FROM EVILS AND REMISSION OF SINS; AND FINALLY, SALVATION.<p>These are the virtues in their order which the Lord makes effective in those who believe on Him, and who adapt and prepare themselves to receive Him and become His dwelling-place. This is brought about by means of Divine Truth, and in the case of Christians, by means of the Word, as this is the only means by which a man approaches the Lord, and into which the Lord enters. For, as was said above, the Lord is the Divine Truth itself, and whatever proceeds from Him is Divine Truth. It is, however, Divine Truth from good that is to be understood, and this is the same as faith from charity, for faith is nothing but truth, and charity is nothing but goodness. By means of Divine Truth from good, that is, by means of faith from charity, a man is reformed and regenerated; then renewed, quickened, sanctified and justified; and according as those virtues progress and develop, he is also purified from evils: and purification from these is the remission of sins. However, all these several operations of the Lord cannot here be explained in detail, for each requires its exposition to be confirmed from the Word and rationally illustrated; and this does not belong to our present subject. The reader is therefore referred to later parts of this work which treat in due order of Charity, Faith, Free Will, Repentance, Reformation and Regeneration. It should be known that the Lord without ceasing renders effective those saving graces in every man, for they are the steps to heaven, and the Lord wills the salvation of all men; thus the salvation of all is the end He has in view, and He who wills the end wills also the means. The Lord's Coming, His Redemption, and the Passion of the Cross, were all for the sake of man's salvation, <a href="3927/matthew_18_11.htm">Matthew 18:11</a>; <a href="3927/luke_19_10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>; and as man's salvation was, and eternally is, the end He has in view, it follows that the operations just mentioned are mediate ends, while salvation is the ultimate end. </p>

142. II. QUOD DIVINA VIRTUS ET OPERATIO, QUAE INTELLIGITUR PER SPIRITUM SANCTUM, SINT IN GENERE REFORMATIO ET REGENERATIO, ET SECUNDUM HAS INNOVATIO, VIVIFICATIO, SANCTIFICATIO, ET JUSTIFICATIO, ET SECUNDUM HAS PURIFICATIO A MALIS, ET REMISSIO PECCATORUM, ET TANDEM SALVATIO. Hae sunt in suo ordine Virtutes, quas Dominus operatur apud illos qui credunt in Ipsum, ac se accommodant, et disponunt ad receptionem et habitationem Ipsius, et hoc fit per Divinum Verum, et apud Christianos per Verbum, hoc enim est unicum medium, per quod homo ad Dominum accedit, et in quod Dominus intrat; nam ut supra dictum est, Dominus est ipsum Divinum Verum, et quicquid procedit ex Ipso, est illud: sed intelligendum Divinum Verum ex Bono, quod idem est cum Fide ex Charitate, fides enim non aliud est, quam veritas, et charitas non aliud quam bonitas. Per Divinum Verum ex Bono, hoc est, per Fidem ex Charitate, homo reformatur et regeneratur, tum innovatur, vivificatur, sanctificatur, justificatur, et secundum horum progressiones et incrementa purificatur a malis, et purificatio ab his est remissio peccatorum. Sed omnes hae Operationes Domini non possunt hic singulatim exponi, quia unaquaevis suam Analysin confirmatam ex Verbo, et illustratam a ratione postulat, et hoc hujus loci non est, quare remittitur Lector ad illa quae ordine sequuntur in hoc Opere, quae sunt de Charitate, Fide, Libero Arbitrio, Poenitentia, et de Reformatione et Regeneratione. Sciendum est, quod Dominus illas salutes continuo operetur apud unumquemvis hominem, sunt enim gradus ad Coelum, Dominus enim vult omnium salutem, quare salus omnium Ipsi est finis, et qui vult finem, vult media: propter salutem hominum fuit Adventus, Redemptio et Passio crucis Ipsius, <a href="3927/matthew_18_11.htm">Matthaeus 18:11</a>; <a href="3927/luke_19_10.htm">Luca 19:10</a>, et quia salus hominum Ipsi fuit et in aeternum est finis, sequitur quod supramemoratae operationes sint fines medii, et salvatio finis ultimus. </p>
