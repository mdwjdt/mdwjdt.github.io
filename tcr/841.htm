841. 灵界的犹太人<p>在灵界, 1757年最后审判之前, 犹太人出现在基督徒中心区左边的山谷里, 后来被转到了北方, 除了游荡在城外边的基督徒外, 他们被禁止与其他基督徒交往。 该地区有两座大城市, 犹太人死后会来到这里。 审判之前, 这两座城市都叫耶路撒冷, 但审判之后, 有了另外一个名字; 因为审判之后, “耶路撒冷”表唯独敬拜主的教会。 在这两座城市, 已转化的犹太人被派给他们, 这些人警告他们不要用轻蔑的口吻提及基督, 并惩罚那些顽固不化者。 其城市的街道满是齐踝深的泥浆; 屋里垃圾遍地, 臭不可闻, 以至于无法靠近。 后来我发现很多犹太人在南部地区找到居住地, 我打听他们是谁, 被告知是一些对他人敬拜漠不关心的人, 他们心中质疑弥赛亚是否降临, 还有在世时理性思考各种问题, 并理性生活的人。 这些人中绝大部分是所谓的葡萄牙犹太人。 </p>

841. Jews in the Spiritual World
<p>Before the Last Judgment, which took place in the year 1757, Jews appeared to the left side of the Christian center in a valley there. After the Last Judgment, however, they were transferred to the north and forbidden to interact with Christians unless those Christians were traveling and were not in their own cities.
<p>In that area there are two large cities to which Jews are brought after they die. Before the Last Judgment both of these cities were referred to as Jerusalem, but after it they were given new names, since Jerusalem now refers to the teachings of the church that regards the Lord as the sole object of worship.
<p>The governors overseeing these cities are converted Jews who warn the local populations not to say harsh and insulting things about Christ. The governors punish people who violate this rule.
<p>The streets of these cities are ankle-deep in filth. The houses have so much foul-smelling garbage everywhere that it is difficult to get near them.
<p>Later on, though, I did find out that many from these Jewish populations have been given places to stay in the southern region. When I asked what type of people were relocating, I was told that they were Jews who had found little value in the worship practices followed by other Jews, and who had come to question whether the Messiah would ever come. There were also Jews there who had given rational thought to a variety of topics while they were in the world and who had lived rational lives as well; a majority of this last group were so-called Portuguese Jews. </p>

841. The Jews in the spiritual world.<p>Before the Last judgment, which took place in 1757, the Jews were to be seen in a valley to the left of the Christian centre. Following it they were transferred to the north and forbidden to have any contact with Christians, except for wanderers outside the cities. In that quarter there are two large cities to which Jews were taken after death; before the Judgment they were both called Jerusalem, but afterwards they were given another name, since after the Judgment 'Jerusalem' meant the church in respect of its teaching in which the Lord alone is worshipped. They have converted Jews set over them in their cities, who warn them not to speak insultingly of Christ, and punish those who still do so. The streets of their cities are full of mud, ankle deep, and their houses are so full of rubbish that they smell too bad for them to be entered. Afterwards I observed that many of that nation had found somewhere to live in the southern quarter. When I asked who they were, I was told it was those who had paid little heed to the worship practised by the rest, and had mental reservations about whether the Messiah would ever come, as well as those who had thought rationally about various subjects in the world and had followed reason in their lives. The greater number of these are the Jews known as Portuguese. </p>

841. THE JEWS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD. <p>Previous to the last judgment, which took place in the year 1757, the Jews appeared in a valley in the spiritual world at the left side of the Christian center. Afterwards they were transferred to the north, and interaction with Christians, except with those wandering outside of the cities, was forbidden them. In this quarter there are two large cities to which the Jews were taken after death, and both of these, previous to the judgment, they called Jerusalem, but after it by another name; because since the judgment "Jerusalem" means a church with reference to doctrine wherein the Lord alone is worshiped. In their cities converted Jews are placed over them who warned them not to speak contemptuously of Christ, and who punish those that persist in doing so. The streets of their cities are filled with mud ankle-deep; and the houses are full of filth, from which they smell so abominably that they cannot be approached. I afterward noticed that others of that nation obtained a place of abode in the southern quarter; and when I asked who they were I was told that they were those who made light of the worship of the rest, and who questioned in their minds whether the Messiah would come, and who had also thought rationally about various matters in the world, and had lived accordingly. Those called Portuguese Jews constitute the greater part of this class. </p>

841. X. THE JEWS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD.<p>Before the Last Judgment, which took place in the year 1757, the Jews appeared in a valley on the left of the centre occupied by the Christians After that event they were transferred to the north, and were forbidden to have intercourse with Christians, except with stragglers who wandered outside their cities. I, that quarter there are two large cities to which Jews are conducted after death. Both of these, before the Last Judgment, were called Jerusalem; but after that by another name, because since the Judgment, Jerusalem signifies the Church as to doctrine, in which the Lord alone is worshiped. In their cities converted Jews are set over them, who warn them not to speak disrespectfully of Christ; and they punish those who persist in doing so. The streets of their cities are filled up with mire, ankle-deep, and their houses with uncleanness to such a degree that they cannot be approached because of their offensive smell. I noticed afterwards that many Jews had obtained a settlement in the southern quarter. On inquiring who they were I was informed that some of these disregarded the worship of the rest, and had doubts as to whether the Messiah should ever come; and that some, when in the world, had thought from reason on various subjects, and had lived accordingly. These consist chiefly of Portuguese Jews. </p>

841. DE JUDAEIS IN MUNDO SPIRITUALI.<p>Judaei ante Ultimum Judicium, quod factum est Anno 1757, ad latus sinistrum Meditullii Christiani in Valle ibi apparuerunt; post illud translati sunt in Septentrionem, et interdictum est illis commercium cum Christianis, nisi cum vagis extra Urbes. Sunt in illa Plaga duae magnae Urbes, in quas Judaei post mortem translati sunt, quas ante Judicium vocaverunt Hierosolymas, sed post illud alio nomine, quia post Judicium per Hierosolymam intelligitur Ecclesia quoad Doctrinam, in qua Dominus solus colitur. Praeficiuntur illis in suis Urbibus Judaei conversi, qui monent illos, ne contumeliose loquantur de Christo; et puniunt illos qui usque id faciunt. Plateae Urbium illorum oppletae sunt Coeno usque ad talos, et Domus immundis, a quibus etiam olent, propter quae non adiri possunt. Postmodum animadverti, quod plures ex illa Gente sedem commorationis etiam nacti sint in Plaga Meridionali, et dum quaesivi, quinam illi, dictum est, quod sint qui parvifecerunt Cultum reliquorum, et haeserunt animis de Messia num unquam venturus sit, tum qui de variis rebus in Mundo cogitaverunt ex ratione, et secundum illam vixerunt; horum plurimam partem constituunt Judaei qui nuncupantur Portugisi. </p>
