578. What we would be like if we did not cooperate with the Lord can be further illustrated with the following comparisons. If we perceived or sensed anything spiritual related to heaven or the church, it would strike us as something hostile or disagreeable flowing in, the way our nose would react to a rotten smell, our ear would react to a dissonant sound, our eye would react to a hideous sight, or our tongue would react to something disgusting.
<p>If the delight associated with goodwill and the enjoyment associated with faith were to flow in to the spiritual organic structure of the mind of people who take delight in evil and falsity, such people would feel terrible pain and torment until they eventually collapsed unconscious. The spiritual organic structure consists of long strands in helixes; under that circumstance in people of that type, it would wrap itself in coils and would be tormented like a snake on a swarm of ants. The truth of this has been fully demonstrated to me in the spiritual world through an abundance of experiences. </p>

578. Comparisons too can illustrate what a person would be like, if he did not co-operate with the Lord. When he perceived or felt any spiritual influence from heaven or the church, it would be like something hostile or discordant coming in, such as a rotten smell to the nose, a dissonance to the ear, a monstrosity to the eye and a foul taste to the tongue. If the pleasure of charity and the beauty of faith were to fall upon the spiritual organism of the minds of those who delight in evil and falsity, they would be so vexed and tormented by the intrusion of that pleasure and beauty, that they would end by falling into a faint. This organism is composed of a continuous series of helices; and in the case of such people it would wrap itself into coils and writhe like a snake on an ant-hill. I can vouch for the truth of this as the result of many experiences in the spiritual world. </p>

578. What man would be if he did not cooperate with the Lord, may also be illustrated by comparisons: When he had a perception and sense of anything spiritual pertaining to heaven and the church, it would be as if something distasteful or discordant flowed in, like an offensive smell entering the nose, a discordant sound the ear, a monstrous sight the eye, or a foul taste affecting the tongue. If a delight of charity or a pleasure of belief were to flow into the spiritual organism of the mind of those whose delight is in evil and falsity, if such delight and pleasure were thrust upon them, they would be in anguish and torture, and finally would fall into a swoon. Because that organism consists of perpetual helices, in such a case it would coil itself up in spirals, and writhe like a serpent on an ant-hill. The truth of this has been proved to me by much experience in the spiritual world. </p>

578. What the state of a man would be if he did not co-operate with the Lord, may be illustrated by the following comparisons. The spiritual things of heaven and the Church would excite in him perceptions and sensations as if something disagreeable or discordant were affecting him. They would affect him as a noisome odor does the nose, deformity the eye, and a nasty taste the tongue. If the delights of charity and the pleasures of faith were to enter the spiritual organism of the minds of those who are in the enjoyment of evil and falsity, they would be pained and tortured, and at length would fall into a swoon. For the mind is an organism consisting of continuous spirals, which, with such persons, would coil up and writhe like a snake on an ant-hill. That this is the case has been made evident to me by much experience in the spiritual world. </p>

578. Illustrari per comparationes etiam potest, qualis homo foret, si non cooperaretur cum Domino; foret dum percipit et sentit aliquid spirituale Coeli et Ecclesiae, sicut antipathicum aut discors quid influeret, et sicut putidum in nasum, dissonum in aurem, monstrosum in oculum, ac tetrum in linguam; si jucundum charitatis et amaenum fidei, influerent in spiritualem organismum mentis illorum, qui in jucundo mali et falsi sunt, hi si jucunda et amaena illa intruderentur, angerentur et cruciarentur, et tandem caderent in deliquium; organismus ille quia ex perpetuis helicibus consistit, hic apud tales se involveret <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
in spiras, et torqueretur sicut serpens super acervo formicarum. Quod ita sit, ex multa experientia in Mundo spirituali mihi testatum factum est.<p>
