</h4>
<p>
797. As for Melanchthon, I have been allowed to learn a number of things about the kind of life he had when he first arrived in the spiritual world and how his circumstances changed later on. I learned this not only from angels but also from some interactions of my own with him. I have spoken with him a number of times, but not as often or as intimately as with Luther. The reason the communication was not as often or as intimate was that he was not in a position to have as much access to me, because in his studies he was fixated on justification by faith alone; he was not focusing on goodwill, and I was surrounded by angelic spirits who were devoted to goodwill, and they blocked his access to me.
</p>
<p>
[2] I have been told that as soon as he arrived in the spiritual world, there was a house prepared for him that was much like the house where he had lived in the world. In fact, this is done for most newly arrived spirits, with the result that they do not realize they are no longer in the physical world. The time just after they died seems to them in retrospect as if they had merely been asleep.
<p>Everything in his apartment was the same as it had been - the same table, the same writing desk with pigeonholes, the same bookcase. Therefore as soon as he arrived there, he sat down at his table as if he had just woken up from a night's sleep. He continued writing, as he had been, on the subject of justification by faith alone. He wrote on this topic for a number of days without making even the slightest mention of goodwill. The angels noticed this and asked him through messengers why he was not also writing about goodwill.
<p>"Goodwill has nothing to do with the church," he replied. "If it were made out to be some essential attribute of the church, people would take credit for being justified and saved, and this would deprive faith of its spiritual essence. "
</p>
<p>
[3] When the angels who were above his head sensed his answer, and when the angels who were associated with him whenever he left home heard about it, they withdrew from him. (Every new arrival is accompanied by angels to begin with.)
<p>Several weeks after that, the furnishings and supplies in his apartment began to fade away gradually until they disappeared. Eventually, there was nothing left there but a table, some pieces of paper, a pen, and some ink. The walls of his apartment were by then simply plastered with lime, and his floor was made of yellow bricks. He found himself wearing humble clothing. He was very surprised by this, and asked around to find out why this was. He was told that it was because he was removing goodwill from the church when in fact goodwill is the very heart of the church. Every time it came up, however, he strongly disagreed.
<p>He continued to write about faith as the church's only essential ingredient and the only means of being saved, and he kept creating a greater and greater distance between goodwill and the church. Because he did so, he one day suddenly found himself underground in a workhouse where there were others like him. He wanted to leave, but was prevented from doing so. He was informed that this and nothing else was the final outcome for people who threw goodwill and good works out the church door.
<p>Nevertheless, because he had been one of the leaders of the Protestant Reformation, he was released from there by command of the Lord and brought back to his old apartment, where there was nothing but a table, some paper, a pen, and some ink.
<p>Because his ideas were set, he once again filled that paper with the same theological error. Therefore there was no way to prevent him from going down again to his friends in confinement and then coming back up again. When he came back up, he was dressed in hairy animal skins, because faith that lacks goodwill is freezing cold.
</p>
<p>
[4] He told me firsthand that there was another room off his apartment at the back, where people like him who had likewise banished goodwill were sitting at three tables. A fourth table would sometimes appear there as well, with various kinds of monsters on it, but he and the others were for some reason not frightened away by them. He said he was having conversations with the other people, and every day they were giving him further support for his views.
<p>Quite a while later, fear did take hold of him, and he began writing something about goodwill, but what he would write on a piece of paper one day would no longer be visible the next day. (Actually, this can happen to anyone in that world. What the outer self writes without the compliance of the inner self at the same time - therefore what is written under coercion rather than in freedom - spontaneously deletes itself.)
</p>
<p>
[5] Then the new heaven began to be established by the Lord. In the light from that heaven, Melanchthon began to think that he might actually be in error. He started to feel anxiety about what his final outcome was going to be. He became aware of some deep ideas that had been impressed on him earlier about goodwill. In that state of mind he did some research in the Word. His eyes were opened and he saw that the Word was completely full of loving God and loving our neighbor. He came to see that what the Lord said was true - that all the Law and the Prophets, that is, the Word as a whole, did indeed hinge on these two commandments [<a href="3927/matthew_22_40.htm">Matthew 22:40</a>].
<p>He was then moved to another house much deeper to the south on the western side. He had a conversation with me there, and told me that now his writing about goodwill was not disappearing the way it used to; it would fade somewhat, but it was still legible the following day.
</p>
<p>
[6] I was surprised by the fact that when he walked, his footsteps made a clanking sound, like someone walking across cobblestones in iron shoes.
<p>To these points I might add that once, when some spirits who had recently arrived from earth came to his apartment to see him and speak with him, he called on one of the magic spirits who had the ability to project images to look like furniture and accessories. That spirit decorated his apartment with apparent wall-hangings, carpets with a rose pattern, and a bookcase in the middle of the room. As soon as the visitors left, all that disappeared, though, and the apartment returned to its bare lime-plastered walls and its stark emptiness. But this happened when he was in that first state. </p>

</h4>
<p>
797. As for Melanchthon, I was allowed to learn a lot about his fate his first coming into the spiritual world, and what it was later upon on, not only from angels, but from himself, for I spoke with him a number of times, though not as often or at as close range as with Luther. The reason for this restriction was that he could not approach as closely, because he devoted his researches only to justification by faith alone, and not to charity; and I was surrounded by angelic spirits devoted to charity, who prevented him from approaching me.</p>
<p>
[2] I was told that as soon as he entered the spiritual world, he was provided with a house like that in which he had lived in the world. (This also happens to most new arrivals, so that they remain unaware of being no longer in the natural world, and the time which has elapsed since they died seems like no more than a sleep.) Everything in his room too was similar; he had a similar table, a similar writing-desk with compartments and also a bookcase. So as soon as he arrived, as if he had just awoken from sleep, he sat down at the table and went on writing; his subject then was justification by faith alone, and he went on thus for some days, with not a word about charity. When the angels perceived this, they sent to ask him why he did not write about charity too. He replied that the church was in no way dependent upon charity, for if charity were accepted as an essential of the church, man would also attribute to himself the merit of justification and so of salvation, thus depriving faith of its spiritual essence.</p>
<p>
[3] When this was perceived by the angels who were overhead, and heard by those who had associated with him when he was out of his house, they went away. (Every newcomer has angels associated with him at first.) Some weeks after this had happened, the objects he was using in the room began to grow dim and finally to fade away, until at length nothing was left there but a table, paper and an ink-pot. Moreover, the walls of his room appeared to be covered with whitewash and the floor was paved with yellow brick; he himself wore coarser clothes. When he was surprised at this and asked around to learn the reason, he received the answer that it was because he had banished charity from the church, when in fact it is its heart. But because he so often spoke against it, continuing to write about faith as the one and only essential of the church and the means of salvation, removing charity further and further away, he suddenly found himself in an underground workroom, full of similar people. When he wanted to leave, he was detained, and warned that this is the fate awaiting those who cast charity and good deeds out of the church doors. Still, since he was one of the reformers of the church, he was taken out on the Lord's instructions, and sent back to his previous room, where he had nothing but a table, paper and an ink-pot. Yet the ideas he had convinced himself of made him blot the paper with similar errors; so he could not be kept from being alternately sent down to his companions in prison and at other times being released. When released he appeared to be dressed in furs, since faith without charity is cold.</p>
<p>
[4] He told me himself that there was another room adjoining his at the back, containing three tables, at which sat three men who, like him, had also driven charity into exile; and there sometimes a fourth table appeared on which various monstrous forms were to be seen, though these did not frighten them away. He said that he talked with these men, and they convinced him more every day. However, after some time he became fearful and started to compose something about charity, but what he wrote on the paper one day he was unable to read the next. For this is what happens to everyone there, if he draws only on the external man for what he puts on paper, and not on the internal at the same time; he writes then from compulsion, not from free choice, and it is blotted out automatically.</p>
<p>
[5] After the Lord began the foundation of the new heaven, the light coming from it made him start thinking that he might perhaps be wrong. So, worrying about his fate, he became aware of some interior ideas about charity which had been impressed on him. In that state he consulted the Word, and then his eyes were opened and he saw that it was completely full of love to God and love towards the neighbour, so that it was as the Lord says, on these two commandments depend the law and the prophets, that is to say, the whole Word. From this time on he was moved further in towards the south-west, and so to another house. From there he spoke with me, and said that now his writing about charity does not fade as it did before, but is dimly visible the next day.</p>
<p>
[6] I was surprised that when he walks his footsteps ring out rhythmically, like those of people wearing iron-shod boots walking on a stone surface. I must add that when some newcomers from the world entered his room to see him and talk with him, he summoned one of the spirit magicians, who were able by imagination to produce various pleasant appearances. They then furnished his room with ornaments, rose-coloured carpets, and also a kind of bookcase in the middle. However, as soon as they left, these appearances disappeared, and the former whitewash and emptiness came back. But these events happened when he was in his former state. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #797 (Ager, 1970)
</h4>
<p>
797. As to the lot of Melancthon when he first entered the spiritual world, and what it was afterward, I have been permitted to learn many things not only from angels but also from himself, for I have talked with him repeatedly, yet not so often nor so intimately as with Luther. The reason why I have not talked with him so often or so intimately is that he could not approach me as Luther did, because he had given his attention so fully to justification by faith alone, and not to charity; and I was surrounded by angelic spirits who were in charity, and who were a hindrance to his approaching me.
</p>
<p>
[2] I have heard that when he first entered the spiritual world, a house was prepared for him like that in which he had dwelt in the world. This is done for most of the newcomers there, and for this reason they do not know but that they are still in the natural world, and the time that has passed since their death seems to them merely as a sleep. Also everything in his room was like what he formerly had; a similar table, a similar desk with compartments, and a similar library; so that as soon as he came there, as if he had just awakened from a sleep, he seated himself at the table and continued his writing, and that, too, on the subject of justification by faith alone, and so, on for several days, writing nothing whatever about charity. The angels perceiving this, asked him through messengers why he did not write about charity also. He replied that there is nothing of the church in charity, for if charity were to be received as in any way an essential attribute of the church, man would ascribe to himself the merit of justification and consequently of salvation, and thus he would rob faith of its spiritual essence.
</p>
<p>
[3] When the angels who were over his head perceived this, and when the angels who were associated with him when he was outside of his house heard it (for angels are associated with every newcomer at the beginning), they all withdrew. A few weeks after this occurred, the things that he used in his room began to be obscured and at length to disappear, until at last there was nothing left there but the table, paper, and ink stand; and, moreover, the walls of his room seemed to be plastered with lime, and the floor to be covered with a yellowish, brick-like material, and he himself to be in coarser clothing. Wondering at this, he asked of those about him why it was so, and was told that it was because he had separated charity from the church, which was, nevertheless, its heart. But as he repeatedly contradicted this, and went on writing about faith as the one only essential of the church and the means of salvation, and separated charity more and more, he suddenly seemed to himself to be under ground in a sort of workhouse, where there were others like him. And when he wished to go out he was detained, and it was announced to him that no other lot awaits those who thrust charity and good works outside of the doors of the church. But as he had been one of the Reformers of the church, he was released by the Lord's command, and sent back to his former room, where there was nothing but the table, paper, and ink stand. Nevertheless, because of his confirmed ideas, he continued to besmear the paper with the same error, so that he could not be kept from being alternately sent down to his captive fellows and sent back again. When sent back, he appeared in a garment made of a hairy skin, because faith without charity is cold.
</p>
<p>
[4] He himself told me that there was another room adjoining his own in the rear, in which there were three tables, at which sat men like himself, who had likewise exiled charity, and that sometimes a fourth table appeared there, on which were seen monstrous things in various forms, but they were not frightened thereby from their work. He said that he conferred with these, and was confirmed by them daily. Nevertheless, after a time, he was smitten with fear, and began to write something about charity; but what he wrote on the paper one day he did not see the next day, for this is what happens to everyone there when he commits anything to paper from the external man only, and not also from the internal, thus from compulsion and not from freedom. The writing is obliterated of itself.
</p>
<p>
[5] But after the beginning of the establishment of the new heaven by the Lord, he began to think from the light from that heaven that he might possibly be in error; and in consequence, because of anxiety about his lot, he felt impressed upon him some interior ideas respecting charity. In this state he consulted the Word, and then his eyes were opened, and he saw that it was filled throughout with love to God and love towards the neighbor, so that it was, as the Lord says, that on these two commandments hang the law and the prophets, that is, the whole Word. From this time he was interiorly conveyed into the southern quarter towards the west, and thus to another house, and there he talked with me, saying that his writings on charity did not then vanish as formerly, but appeared obscurely the next day.
</p>
<p>
[6] One thing I wondered at, that when he walked, his steps had a clanking sound, like those of a man walking with iron heels on a stone pavement. To this must be added, that when any novitiate from the world entered his room to talk with him or see him, he would summon a spirit from among those given to magic, who by fantasy could call up various beautiful shapes, and who then adorned his chamber with ornaments and flowered tapestry, and also with the appearance of a library in the center. But as soon as the visitors were gone those shapes vanished, and the former plastering and emptiness returned. But this was when he was in his former state. </p>

<p>
797. MELANCHTHON. <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
It has been granted me to know many things concerning the nature of his lot, both when he first entered the spiritual world and afterwards, not only from angels but also from himself; for I have conversed with him several times, though not so frequently nor so intimately as with Luther. This was because he could not approach me as Luther <sup "fn9_2">2</sup>
did, since he was very intent upon justification by faith alone, to the exclusion of charity; while I was surrounded by angelic spirits who are in charity, and they prevented his approach to me.</p>
<p>
[2] I heard that as soon as he entered the spiritual world a house was provided for him similar to that in which he had lived in the world. This happens in the case of most persons on their first arrival, so that they do not know but that they are still in the natural world, and that the time which has elapsed since their death has only been as a sleep. Thus all the things in his room were similar to those he had before; a table, a writing-desk with drawers and a library. As soon, then, as he entered the spiritual world, like one just awaking from sleep there, he seated himself at the table and continued writing, his subject then being justification by faith alone. This went on far several days, but he did not mention charity. When this was perceived by the angels, he was asked by messengers from them why he did not write also about charity. He replied that there was nothing of the Church in charity; for if charity should be received as an essential of the Church, man would ascribe to himself the merit of justification, and consequently of salvation, and so would deprive faith of its spiritual essence.</p>
<p>
[3] Now angels are associated with every new comer at the beginning; and when those angels who were over Melanchthon's head perceived what he said, and when those who were associated with him when he went out of doors heard it, they withdrew from him.<p>Some weeks after this, the things which he used in his room began to be obscured, and disappear, until at last there was nothing left but the table, paper and inkstand; and moreover, the walls of his room appeared to be roughly coated with plaster and the floor covered with yellow clay, and he himself seemed to be more coarsely clad. When he wondered at these things and asked those around him the reason, he was told it was because he had removed charity from the Church, although charity is its very heart. But as he so often denied this, and continued to write about faith as the only essential of the Church and means of salvation, and to remove charity still farther away, he suddenly found himself in an underground workhouse, where there were others like him. When he endeavoured to leave, he was detained, and informed that no other lot awaits those who turn charity and good works out of the doors of the Church. However, as he had been one of the reformers of the Church, he was released by the Lord's command and sent back to his former room, where there remained only his table, paper and inkstand. But as he still continued, owing to his confirmed opinions, to smear his pages with the same error, it was impossible to prevent him from being alternately sent down among his imprisoned friends and sent back again. When he was sent back, he appeared clad in a fur coat, because faith without charity is cold.</p>
<p>
[4] Melanchthon told me himself that at the back of the house there was a room next to his own containing three tables, at which were seated persons like himself, who also had cast out charity; and that at times a fourth table appeared there, upon which were seen strange creatures of various shapes; but these did not disturb their work. He added that he entered into conversation with them, and was by them daily confirmed in his opinions. After some time, however, being seized with fear, he began to write out something concerning charity; but that he wrote one day he did not see the next. This happens to every one there when he commits to paper something from the external man only and not at the same time from the internal, thus under compulsion and not in freedom: it simply vanishes of itself.</p>
<p>
[5] But after the new heaven was established by the Lord, Melanchthon, from light proceeding out of that heaven, began to think that possibly he was in error; and, therefore, being anxious about his future lot, he became aware of some interior ideas concerning charity being impressed upon him. In this state he consulted the Word, and then his eyes were opened, and he saw that it is full of love to God and love towards the neighbor; and thus, as the Lord says, that on these two commandments hang the Law and the Prophets, that is, the whole Word. Then he was transferred to another house more to the south-west where he conversed with me, saying that his writing concerning charity did not vanish as before, although on the following day it appeared somewhat obscure.</p>
<p>
[6] I was also surprised to notice that when he walks his steps make a sound like the tread of men wearing iron shoes on a stone pavement. I would mention in addition that when any new comers from the world entered his room to see and talk with him, he would summon one of the magic-working spirits who by their art of illusion were able to produce various kinds of decorations. They adorned his room with ornaments and flowered tapestries, and also with a library which appeared in the centre. But as soon as his visitors were gone, the decorations vanished, and the former plaster and emptiness returned. This, however, happened during his earlier state.<p>

He was a student at Erfurt in law and divinity, and was ordained priest in A.D. 1507. He left Erfurt for a chair in the university of Wittenberg, where his preaching attracted great attention. Here he made his first public protest against the Romish Church by condemning the sale of indulgences. The Lutheran Church dates its origin from the year A.D. 1520 when Luther was expelled from the Romish Church. It assumed a more definite shape on the publication in A.D. 1530 of the Augsburg Confession. This was drawn up by Melanchthon and Luther as the principal standard of the Church. The final establishment of the Lutheran Church was made possible by the friendly offices of Maurice, Elector of Saxony. </p>

797. Quod MELANCTONEM attinet, de Sorte ejus, qualis haec fuit dum primum in Mundum Spiritualem venit, et qualis postea, plura scire datum est, non solum ab Angelis, sed etiam ab Ipso, nam cum illo aliquoties loquutus sum, sed non ita saepe et prope ut cum Luthero; quod non tam saepe et prope, erat causa, quia non similiter accedere potuit, quoniam tantummodo Justificationi per solam Fidem studium impendit, non autem Charitati, et circumdatus sum Spiritibus angelicis qui in Charitate sunt, et hi accessum ad me intercluserunt.</p>
<p>
[2] Audivi, quod ut primum Mundum spiritualem intravit, parata illi esset Domus similis domui, in qua commoratus est in Mundo; hoc fit etiam plerisque novis advenis, ex quo non aliter sciunt, quam quod adhuc in Mundo naturali sint, et quod tempus a Morte praeterlapsum fuerit modo sicut somnus; in Conclavi ejus etiam omnia similia erant, similis Mensa, simile Chartaphylacium cum loculamentis, et quoque Librarium; quare ut <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
primum illuc venit, illico sicut evigilatus a somno, adposuit se Mensae, et continuavit scribere, et tunc de Justificatione per solam Fidem, et similiter per aliquot dies, et prorsus nihil de Charitate; hoc percepto ab Angelis, quaesitus est per nuntios, cur non etiam scriberet de Charitate; respondit, quod in Charitate nihil Ecclesiae esset, nam si illa ut quoddam essentiale Ecclesiae attributum reciperetur, homo etiam sibi meritum justificationis et inde salvationis addicaret, et sic quoque Fidem essentia sua spirituali orbaret;</p>
<p>
[3] quando hoc perceperunt Angeli, qui super Caput ejus erant, et hoc audiverunt Angeli, qui illi, dum extra domum suam erat, adsociati fuerunt, recesserunt, nam cuivis Advenae in principio associantur Angeli; hoc facto, post aliquot septimanas, inceperunt illa quae usui illi erant in Conclavi, obscurari et demum evanescere, et tandem usque eo, ut ibi nihil praeter Mensam, Chartas, et Atramentarium remaneret, et insuper Conclave ejus quoad parietes apparuit incrustatum calce, et pavimentum materia lateritia flava obductum, et ipse in rudiore veste; quod cum miratus est, et circum se quaesivit, cur illa, responsum tulit, quia Charitatem ab Ecclesia removit, quae tamen ejus Cor est, sed quia toties contradixit, et perrexit scribere de Fide, ut unico essentiali Ecclesiae, ac medio salutis, ac plus et plus removere Charitatem, subito sibi visus est sub terra in quodam Ergastulo, ubi similes erant; et dum voluit inde exire, retentus est, et ei denuntiatum, quod non alia sors maneat illos, qui Charitatem et bona Opera extra fores Ecclesiae ejiciunt; at quoniam unus inter Reformatores Ecclesiae erat, ex mandato Domini inde exemptus est, et remissus in Conclave suum prius, ubi solum Mensa, Charta et Atramentarium erant, at usque ex ideis confirmatis illevit chartas simili errore, quare non potuit custodiri, quin alternis demitteretur ad captivos sodales, et alternis emitteretur; cum emissus est, apparuit indutus pelle hirsuta, quoniam Fides absque Charitate est frigida.</p>
<p>
[4] Narravit mihi ipse, quod alia Camera a parte postica sua, adjuncta esset, in qua erant tres Mensae, quibus assidebant ei similes, qui Charitatem etiam in exilium ejecerunt, et quod ibi etiam quarta Mensa quandoque apparuerit, super qua Monstrosa in variis formis visa sunt, a quibus tamen non deterrefacti sunt; dixit quod cum his loquutus sit, et quod ab illis indies confirmatus. At vero post aliquod tempus percitus timore, coepit aliquid de Charitate exarare, sed quod uno die inscripsit chartae, altero non vidit; hoc enim fit unicuique ibi, dum aliquid ex solo Externo homine immittit chartae, et non simul ab Interno, ita ex coacto et non ex libero, ex se obliteratur.</p>
<p>
[5] At postquam Novum Coelum a Domino coeptum est instaurari, ex luce ex hoc Coelo exorsus est cogitare, quod forte in errore esset, quare ex anxietate propter sortem suam, aliquas ideas interiores sibi impressas de Charitate sensit, in quo statu consuluit Verbum, et tunc aperti sunt ejus oculi, et vidit, quod illud totum plenum esset AMORE IN DEUM, ET AMORE ERGA PROXIMUM, ita quod esset ut Dominus dicit, quod ex duobus illis Mandatis pendeant Lex et Prophetae, hoc est, totum Verbum; ex hoc tempore translatus est interius in Meridiem versus Occidentem, et sic in aliam Domum, e qua mecum loquutus est, dicens, quod nunc Scriptura ejus de Charitate non evanescat sicut prius, sed quod postero die obscure appareat.</p>
<p>
[6] Hoc miratus sum, quod cum ambulat, gressus ejus audiantur pulsatiles, sicut qui ferreis calceis induti super plano lapideo incedunt. His adjiciendum est, quod cum aliqui novitii <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
e Mundo cum illo loquendi et illum videndi causa Conclave ejus intraverunt, advocaverit unum ex spiritibus magicis, qui per phantasias potuerunt inducere varias species decoras, qui tunc exornaverunt Conclave ejus decoramentis, et tapetibus rosaceis, et quoque tanquam Librario in medio; at vero ut primum illi abiverunt, disparatae sunt species illae, ac prior incrustatio calcaria ac inanitas rediit: sed hoc dum in priori Statu fuit.<p>
