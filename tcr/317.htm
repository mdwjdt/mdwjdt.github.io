317. The Seventh Commandment
<p>You Are Not to Steal
<p>In the earthly meaning, this commandment literally covers not stealing, robbing, or privateering during a time of peace. It generally means not using stealth or pretense of any kind to take away someone else's possessions. It also covers all swindling, and illegal ways to profit, earn interest, and collect funds; also fraud in paying taxes and fees and in repaying loans.
<p>Workers transgress against this commandment when they do their work dishonestly and deceptively; retailers, when they mislead customers with their merchandise, weighing, measuring, and calculations; officers, when they dip into their soldiers' pay; judges, when they tilt their judgments toward friends or relatives, or for bribes or other inducements, and thus bias their judgments or investigations and deprive others of goods that belong to those others by law. </p>

317. THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT<p>You are not to steal.<p>In the natural sense this commandment means literally not stealing, engaging in brigandage or piracy in peacetime; and in general not depriving anyone of his goods secretly or on any pretext. It also extends to all imposture and unlawful gain, usury and extortion, as well as fraud in payment of dues and taxes and in repaying debts. Workers who do not work in good faith and without deceit offend against this commandment; so do merchants who cheat over their wares, weights, measures and calculations; so do officers who withhold their troops' pay; and judges who are influenced in their judgments by friendship, bribery, nepotism or other reasons, so perverting laws or legal processes, and depriving others of the lawful possession of their goods. </p>

317. THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT. <p>THOU SHALT NOT STEAL. <p>In the natural sense, this commandment means, according to its letter, not to steal or to rob or to commit piracy in time of peace; and in general, not to take away anyone's goods secretly or under any pretext. It also extends to all impostures and illegitimate gains, usuries, and exactions; and again to frauds in paying taxes and duties and in discharging debts. Laborers transgress this commandment when they do their work unfaithfully and deceitfully; merchants, when they practice deceit in their merchandise, in weight, in measure, and in their accounts; officers, when they deduct from the soldiers' wages; judges, when they give judgment for friendship, reward, relationship, or others reasons, preventing law and evidence, and so depriving others of the goods which they rightfully possess. </p>

317. THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT<p>THOU SHALT NOT STEAL.<p>In the natural sense, this commandment forbids theft, robbery, and piracy in time of peace; and, in general, the taking away of any one's property secretly or under any pretext whatever. It extends also to all forms of imposition and unlawful gain, usury and exaction, as well as to the payment of stated contributions and taxes, and the discharge of debts. Workmen transgress this commandment, who are dishonest and fraudulent in performing their duties; merchants, who practice deception in regard to their goods, in respect of weight, measure and the accounts they render; and officers, who fail to pay soldiers their just wages. Judges also transgress against it, who are influenced by friendship, bribery, relationship, or any other cause in giving judgment, by perverting the laws and corrupting the course of justice, and who thus deprive others of property which they legally possess. </p>

317. SEPTIMUM PRAECEPTUM.<p>Non furaberis.<p>In SENSU NATURALI, per hoc Praeceptum intelligitur secundum literam non furari, latrocinari, et piratam tempore pacis agere; et in genere non alicui sua bona clanculum aut sub aliquo praetextu auferre. Extendit etiam se ad omnes imposturas et illegitimos quaestus, usuras, et exactiones; tum etiam ad defraudationes in pendendis tributis et vectigalibus, et in solvendis debitis. Operarii contra hoc Praeceptum praevaricantur, qui opera sua insincere et subdole faciunt: Mercatores, qui fallunt mercibus, pondere, mensura, et calculis. Praefecti, qui stipendia militibus subtrahunt. Judices, qui pro amicitia, munere, affinitate, aut aliis causis judicant, pervertendo leges aut quaestiones, et sic alios suis bonis, quae jure possident, deprivant. </p>
