<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>19</b>.⑴独一神因存在而名为耶和华，这是因为唯有祂今在，昔在，永在，祂是首先的和末后的，是初和终，是阿拉法和俄梅戛。众所周知，“耶和华”的意思是“自有永有”（ 'I am' and 'Being'）。从创造书或创世记清楚可知，自上古时代神就被如此称呼。在第一章，祂被称为“神”，在第二章及以后续章节，祂被称为“耶和华神”。后来，当亚伯拉罕的后代，从雅各开始，因长期寄居在埃及而忘了神的名时，它重新唤回他们的记忆。对此，我们读到：<br />摩西问当如何称呼神的名字，神对摩西说：“我是那位自有永有的，因此你要对以色列的子女说：‘那位自有的打发我到你们这里来’；你要说：‘耶和华你们祖宗的神，打发我到你们这里来’。耶和华是我的名，直到永远，这也是我的纪念，直到万代”。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.13.htm">出埃及记3:13</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.15.htm">15</a>）<br />由于唯独神自有永有，就是耶和华，所以受造宇宙中没有一物不从祂获得其存在；下面将看到这是怎么回事。这些话也是这个意思：<br />我是首先的，我是末后的；我是初，我是终，我是阿拉法，我是俄梅戛。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.6.htm">以赛亚书44:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.8.htm">启示录1:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.13.htm">22:13</a>）<br />这段经文的意思是，祂自初至终都是独一无二的源头，万物皆出自祂。<br />神被称为“阿拉法和俄梅戛，初和终”，是因为“阿拉法”是希腊字母表中第一个字母，“俄梅戛”是最后一个；因此这两个字母表示综合在一起的万物。原因在于，在灵界，字母表中的每个字母都表示某种事物。使单词发出音来的元音表示与情感或爱相关的某种事物。这就是灵人或天使的言语及其书写系统的起源。不过，这是之前未知的一个秘密：所有天使和灵人所用的语言是一种通用语言，这种语言与世人的语言毫无共同之处。每个人死后都会逐渐掌握这种语言，因为它是每个人自被造之时所固有的。所以在灵界，人人都能理解其他所有人。我经常被允许倾听这种语言，并将其与世上的语言进行对比，发现无论在哪方面，它都与世上的任何属世语言不同。就其初始元素而言，这种语言不同于它们，也就是说，每句话的每个字母都有其特定含义。正因如此，神被称为“阿拉法和俄梅戛”，意思是，祂自初至终都是独一无二的源头，万物皆出自祂。不过，关于源于天使的属灵思维的这种语言及其书写系统，可参看《婚姻之爱》（326－329节），以及本书（280，365.3，386节）。</p>

<p>
19. (1)獨一上帝因祂是根本而名為耶和華, 因祂獨自是,曾是,將是, 並因為祂是首先和末後, 是始和終, 是阿拉法和俄梅戛。
<p>眾所周知, "耶和華"的意思是"自有永有"(I am who I am, 或譯"我是我所是")。從遠古時期, 上帝就如此被稱呼, 可清楚地從『創世記』看出。在第一章中, 祂被稱為"上帝", 在第二章及以後章節中, 祂被稱為"耶和華上帝"。當亞伯拉罕的子孫直到雅各, 在他們長期寄居埃及的日子, 忘記了上帝的名字, 需要重新喚回記憶。有如下記載:摩西問當如何稱呼上帝的名字, 上帝對摩西說:"我是那位自有永有的, 因此你要對以色列的子女說:'那位自有的打發我到你們這裡來'; 你要說:'耶和華你們祖宗的上帝, 打發我到你們這裡來'。耶和華是我的名, 直到永遠, 這也是我的紀念, 直到萬代"(<a href="3927/exodus_3_13.htm">出埃及記3:13-15</a>)。
<p>由於上帝獨自為"我是"和"我所是", 也就是耶和華, 因而被造宇宙中沒有任何事物不將其存在歸源於祂。也可用這些話來表示:我是首先的和末後的, 是始和終, 是阿拉法和俄梅戛(<a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">以賽亞書44:6</a>;<a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">啟示錄1:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_13.htm">22:13</a>)。這些話表示祂自始至終是唯一源泉, 萬物由祂而來。
<p>[2]上帝被稱為"阿拉法和俄梅戛, 始和終", 因為"阿拉法"是希臘字母表中的第一個字母, "俄梅戛"是最後一個; 因此這兩個字母表示萬物聚合一起。因為在心靈世界之中, 每個字母代表某種意義。決定單詞音調的元音, 代表某種情感或愛。靈或天人以這些所代表的意思為基礎來說話與書寫; 這是以前未知的奧秘。事實上, 在心靈世界有一通用語言為全部天人和靈所用, 而這語言與人間任何語言無絲毫共同之處; 每個人死後會逐漸掌握這種語言, 因為該語言先天就賦於每個人被造之時。因此在整個心靈世界, 個個都能明白別人的意思。我曾多次被允許去聆聽這樣的語言。我將此語言與世間語言作對比, 發覺與世上語言無任何共通之處。這種語言之中, 每個詞語每個字都有其特定含義。正因如此, 上帝被稱為"阿拉法和俄梅戛", 表示祂自始至終是唯一源泉, 萬物由祂而來。 </p>

19. 1. The one God is called Jehovah from "being," that is, from the fact that he alone is [and was] and will be, and that he is the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End, the Alpha and the Omega. "Jehovah" means "I am" and "to be," as is generally known. We know from the Book of Creation, or Genesis, that God was called "Jehovah" from most ancient times. In the first chapter he is called "God," but in the second and subsequent chapters he is called "Jehovah God. " Later on the descendants of Abraham through Jacob forgot the name of God owing to their long sojourn in Egypt. Then in the event recorded in the following passage it was recalled to memory:
<p>Moses said to God, "What is your name?" God said, "I Am I Who Am. So you will say to the Children of Israel, 'I Am sent me to you. ' And you will say, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, sent me to you. This is my name to eternity, and this is how I will be remembered from generation to regeneration. " (<a href="3927/exodus_3_13.htm">Exodus 3:13-15</a>)
<p>Since God alone is "I Am" and being, or "Jehovah," therefore nothing exists in the created universe that does not derive its underlying reality from him. (How this happens will be discussed below [<a href="21.htm">21</a>, <a href="75.htm">75-76</a>, <a href="78.htm">78</a>].) The same thing is meant by these words: "I am the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End, the Alpha and the Omega" (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_13.htm">22:13</a>). This means that on every level of existence he is the one and only entity, the source of all things.
</p>
<p>
[2] God is called the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, because alpha is the first letter in the Greek alphabet and omega is the last; so together they mean all things as a whole.
<p>In the spiritual world, every alphabetical letter has a meaning. A vowel, because it carries tone, means a feeling or some kind of love. Spiritual and angelic speech, and also writing, depends on these meanings - but this is a mystery that has not been known until now. There is in fact a universal language shared by all angels and spirits. It has nothing in common with any human language in our world. After death everyone inherits that language, because it is latent in everyone from creation. In the spiritual world, then, everyone can understand everyone else. I have often been allowed to hear that language. I have compared it with languages in the physical world and have ascertained that it has not even the least thing in common with any earthly language. It differs by its very origin, which is that every letter of every word has a meaning. This is why God is here called the Alpha and the Omega, meaning that on every level of existence he is the one and only entity, the source of all things. (For more on how this language and its written form flow from angels' spiritual thought, see the work <a href="swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_326.htm">Marriage Love 326-329</a>; see also what follows in this work [280].) </p>

19. (i) THE ONE GOD IS NAMED JEHOVAH FROM HIS BEING, THAT IS, FROM THE FACT THAT HE ALONE IS, [WAS] AND WILL BE, AND BECAUSE HE IS THE FIRST AND THE LAST, THE BEGINNING AND THE END, ALPHA AND OMEGA.<p>It is well known that Jehovah means 'I am' and 'Being'. It is clear from the Book of Creation, called Genesis, that God was so called from most ancient times; for there He is called God in the first chapter, but in the second and subsequent ones Jehovah God. Later on when the descendants of Abraham, starting with Jacob, forgot the name of God owing to their long stay in Egypt, it was recalled to their memory. About this we read:<p>Moses said to God, What is your name? God said, I am who I am; thus<p>shall you say to the Children of Israel, I am has sent me to you; and you shall say, Jehovah the God of your fathers has sent me to you. This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial from generation to generation, <a href="3927/exodus_3_13.htm">Exodus 3:13-15</a>.<p>Since God alone is I am or Being, that is, Jehovah, therefore there cannot be anything in the created universe which does not owe its being to Him; how this happens will be seen below. The same is meant also by these words:<p>I am the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End, Alpha and Omega, <a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_13.htm">22:13</a>.<p>This means that He is the one single source from beginning to end, from which everything comes.</p>
<p>
[2] God is called Alpha and Omega <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
, the Beginning and the End, because alpha is the first and omega the last letter in the Greek alphabet, and they thus mean everything taken together. The reason is that every letter of the alphabet in the spiritual world stands for some thing. Vowels, which allow words to be pronounced, stand for something to do with affection or love. This is the origin of the speech of spirits or angels, and also of their writing-systems. But this is a mystery not previously known: there is a universal language used by all angels and spirits, which has nothing in common with any human language in the world. Everyone comes into possession of this language after death, for it is inborn in everyone from his creation. Therefore everyone throughout the spiritual world can understand everyone else. I have often been permitted to hear that language, and I have compared it with languages in the world, and found that it does not agree in the slightest detail with any natural language on earth. It differs from them in its basic principle, which is that each letter of every word stands for some thing. That can now be seen to be the reason why God is called Alpha and Omega, the one single source from beginning to end, from which everything comes. On this language and its writing-system, which is derived from the spiritual thought of angels, see <a href="swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_326.htm">Conjugial Love 326-329</a>, and also further in this book [<a href="280.htm">280</a>, <a href="365.htm">365</a>, <a href="386.htm">386</a>].<p>

The words: <p>I am the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End, the Alpha and the Omega (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44</a>:<a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_13.htm">22:13</a>), <p>have the same meaning, signifying, Who is the Itself and the Only from things first to things last, the source of all things.
</p>
<p>
[2] God is called "the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End," because Alpha is the first letter in the Greek alphabet and Omega the last; and therefore the two signify all things in the complex. This is because each letter in the alphabet in the spiritual world signifies a thing. And as the vowels furnish the tone, they signify something belonging to affection or love. This is the origin both of spiritual or angelic speech and of writing there. But it is an arcanum hitherto unknown; for there is a universal language which is the language of all angels and spirits, and which has nothing in common with any language of men in the world; into this language everyone comes after death, for it is inherent in every man from his creation; consequently in the spiritual world everyone can understand every other. I have frequently been permitted to hear that language; and I have compared it with languages in the world, and have found that in no respect whatever does it agree with any natural language on earth. It differs from them in its initial element, which is that each letter in each word has its special meaning. It is for this reason that God is called Alpha and Omega, which means that He is the Itself and the Only from things first to things last, the source of all things. But regarding this speech and form of writing, which flows from the spiritual thought of the angels, see the work on Conjugial Love (n. <a href="swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_326.htm">. 326-329</a>) also in the following pages. </p>

[2] God is called the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End because Alpha is the first and Omega the last letter in the Greek alphabet, and therefore they signify all things in the complex. This is because every letter of the alphabet in the spiritual world has a signification of its own; and every vowel, because it is a symbol of sound, signifies something of affection or love. From this arose spiritual or angelic speech and writing. Hitherto it has been unknown that there is a universal language, <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
the language of all angels and spirits, which has nothing in common with any language of men in the world. Into the use of this language every man comes after death, for it is implanted in every one from creation, and therefore throughout the whole spiritual world all can understand one another. I have frequently been permitted to hear this language, and I have compared it with languages in the world and found that it agrees in not the least particular with any natural language on earth. It differs from these in its fundamental principle that each letter of every word has a particular signification. For this reason God is now called the Alpha and the Omega, by which is meant that He is the Self and only One from first things to last, and that all things are from Him.
