723. 改造与重生一章已说明, 这三者, 主, 仁, 信, 行动如一, 它们就是引向重生的方法, 除非进行重生, 否则没人能进天堂。 故, 主只向重生者敞开天堂, 离世后, 其他人想要被引入天堂是不可能的。 通过重生配领圣餐者, 是指那些内在拥有教会和天堂的这三个要素的人, 而不是仅外在拥有的人。 因为这种人不是用灵魂承认主, 仅仅是口头上承认, 不是发自内心实践对邻之仁, 仅止于身体层面。 用主的话说, 这就是所谓作恶的人:<p>那时, 你们要说, 主啊, 我们在你面前吃过, 喝过。 但我要告诉你们, 我不晓得你们是哪里来的。 你们这一切作恶的人离开我去吧!

723. As has been clearly shown in the chapter on reformation and regeneration [571-625], we are regenerated by these three - the Lord, goodwill, and faith - working together as one; and if we are not regenerated, we cannot come into heaven. Therefore the Lord can open heaven only to those who have been regenerated, and not to others; and after their earthly death, he can incorporate only them and not others into heaven.
<p>The "regenerated" who come forward worthily mean those who have these three essentials of heaven and the church within themselves. The term does not refer, however, to people who have these essentials only outwardly. The latter confess the Lord not with their soul but only with their tongue; they practice goodwill toward their neighbor not with their heart but only with their body. This is the nature of all those whom the Lord calls "workers of wickedness":
<p>You will then begin to say, "Lord, we ate and drank with you," but I will say to you, "I do not know where you are from. Depart from me, all you workers of wickedness. " (<a href="3927/luke_13_26.htm">Luke 13:26-27</a>) </p>

723. It has been shown in the chapter on reformation and regeneration that these three, the Lord, charity and faith, acting as one, are the means to a person's regeneration, and unless this takes place, he cannot come into heaven. The Lord therefore can only open heaven to those who have been regenerated, and after death in the natural world it is impossible for others to be introduced to this process. By the regenerated, who worthily approach, we mean those who inwardly possess those three essentials of the church and of heaven, but not those who possess them only outwardly. For these do not confess the Lord with the soul, but only with the tongue, and do not exercise charity towards the neighbour with the heart, but only with the body. Such are all those called the workers of iniquity in these words of the Lord:<p>Then you will begin to say, Lord, we ate and drank in your presence. But I shall say to you, I do not know where you are from. Depart from me, all you who do iniquity, <a href="3927/luke_13_26.htm">Luke 13:26-27</a>. </p>

<p>
723. That man is regenerated by these three, the Lord, charity, and faith, acting as one, and that no one can enter heaven unless he is becoming regenerate, has been shown in the chapter on Reformation and Regeneration. So the Lord can open heaven to none but the regenerate, and after the natural death introduction into heaven is given to none else. By the regenerate, who come to the holy supper worthily, those are meant who are in these three essentials of the church and heaven interiorly, not those who are so only exteriorly, for such confess the Lord not with the soul but with the tongue only, and practice charity toward the neighbor not with the heart but with the body only. Such are all who are "workers of iniquity," according to these words of the Lord: <p>Then shall ye begin to say, Lord, we have eaten and drunk before Thee. But I will say to you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from Me, all ye workers of iniquity (<a href="3927/luke_13_26.htm">Luke 13:26-27</a>). </p>

723. It was shown in the chapter on Reformation and Regeneration that man is regenerated by these three, the Lord, charity and faith, operating as one; and that unless a man is regenerated he cannot come into heaven. Therefore, the Lord can open heaven to none but the regenerate, and after natural death no others are admitted. By the regenerate, who worthily approach the Holy Supper, are meant those who are interiorly in these three essentials of the Church and heaven, but not those who are only in them exteriorly; for the latter confess the Lord not with the soul, but only with the lips, and exercise charity towards the neighbor not with the heart, but only with outward service. Such are all that work iniquity, according to the Lord's words:<p>"Then shall ye begin to say, (Lord), We have eaten and drunk in thy presence;" but I shall say to you, "I know you not whence ye are: depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity" <a href="3927/luke_13_28.htm">Luke 13:28</a>, <a href="3927/luke_13_27.htm">27</a>. </p>
