604. As for the new will, it is above the old will, on the spiritual level. So is the new intellect. The intellect is with the will and the will is with the intellect. They come together on that level, and together they examine the old, earthly self and arrange all the things in it so that they obey what is higher.
<p>Surely everyone can see what would happen if there were only one level to the human mind - evil traits and good traits would be brought together and mixed up with each other there, as well as false impressions and true impressions, and conflict would erupt. It would be like putting wolves and sheep, or tigers and calves, or hawks and doves together in the same cage. The inevitable outcome would be a cruel slaughter, in which the savage animals tore the gentle ones to pieces.
<p>Therefore it has been provided that good things along with their truths are gathered on a higher level so that they can remain safe and ward off an attack, and can use chains and other means to bring evils under control and finally disperse them along with their falsities.
<p>This is the point made in an earlier section, that the Lord through heaven rules the things of this world that are present in a regenerated person. The higher or spiritual level of the human mind is in fact a heaven in miniature form, and the lower or earthly level is the world in miniature form. This is why the ancients referred to the human being as a microcosm. We could also be called a microheaven. </p>

604. As for the new will, this stands above the old one in the spiritual region; and likewise the new understanding, which is with the will, and the will is with it, They are linked in that region and jointly look into the old or natural one, so arranging everything there as to be obedient. Can anyone fail to see that if the human mind had only one region, and what is evil and what is good, together with falsities and truths, were put together and mixed up there, there would be a conflict, as if wolves and sheep were put together into one cage, or tigers and calves, or hawks and doves? The result would inevitably be savage butchery, and the tame animals would be torn apart by the wild beasts. For this reason provision has been made that what is good together with the relevant truths should be gathered into the upper region, where they can be kept safe, repelling the attacks of and subduing by chains and other means evils and the relevant falsities, finally dispersing them. This is what was meant in the previous section by saying that the Lord by means of heaven controls what concerns the world in the case of a regenerate person. The higher or spiritual region of the human mind is a small-scale heaven, the lower or natural region a small-scale world. That is why the ancients called man a microcosm; and he can also be called a microuranos <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>

604. As to the new will: it is above the old one in the spiritual region, and the new understanding likewise, this with that and that with this. In that region they are conjoined and conjointly look down upon the old or natural will and understanding, and so arrange all things therein as to moderate them. Who cannot see that if there were but one region in the human mind, and if both evils and goods and truths and falsities were there brought together and mixed together, there would be a conflict such as would arise if wolves and lambs, tigers and calves, hawks and doves, were brought together into one enclosure? What would result but a cruel slaughter, the savage beasts tearing in pieces the tame ones? This is why it has been provided that goods with their truths should be collected together in the higher region, so that they may subsist in safety, and resist assault, and also by constraints and other means may subjugate and afterward disperse evils with their falsities. This, then, is the same as was said in the preceding section, that in the regenerated man the Lord through heaven rules what pertains to the world. And the higher or spiritual region of the human mind is a heaven in miniature, while the lower or natural region is a world in miniature, and for this reason man was called by the ancients a microcosm [a little world], and he may also be called a microuranos [a little heaven]. </p>

604. The new will and the new understanding are above the old in the spiritual region of the mind. There they unite, and together they look into the old or natural will and understanding, and dispose all things therein to obedience. Any one can see that if there were only one region in the human mind, and if evils and goods, falsities and truths were brought together and mingled there, a conflict must ensue. It would be as if wolves and sheep, tigers and calves, hawks and doves were confined in one enclosure. The result would be a cruel slaughter, the fierce and savage animals tearing in pieces the meek and gentle. On this account it is provided that goods with their truths should be brought together into the higher region that they may dwell in safety and repel attack, and also by restraints and other means subdue and finally disperse evils with their falsities. This is the meaning of what was said in a former article, that the Lord through heaven rules the things of the world in the regenerate man. The higher or spiritual region of the human mind is also a heaven in miniature, and the lower or natural region is a world in miniature. This is the reason why man was called by the ancients a microcosm, or little world; he may also be called a micro-uranos, or little heaven. </p>

604. Quod novam Voluntatem attinet, est illa supra veterem voluntatem, in regione spirituali, similiter novus Intellectus, hic cum illa, et illa cum hoc; in regione illa se conjungunt, ac conjunctim inspiciunt in veterem seu naturalem, et disponunt omnia ibi, ut obtemperent. Quis non videre potest, quod si in Mente humana foret modo una Regio, et ibi committerentur et commiscerentur mala et bona, ac falsa et vera simul, fieret conflictio sicut in unam caveam committerentur lupi et oves, tigrides et vituli, et accipitres et columbae simul; quid tunc fieret ibi nisi crudelis laniena, et immanes ferae discinderent mansuetas <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
bestias; quare provisum est, ut bona cum suis veris colligantur in superiorem regionem, ut in tuto possint subsistere, ac inhibere assultum, et quoque per catenas et alia media subjugare, et postea discutere mala cum suis falsis. Hoc itaque est, quod in superiore Articulo dictum est, quod Dominus per Coelum regat illa quae Mundi sunt apud hominem regeneratum. Superior seu spiritualis Regio mentis humanae est quoque in minima effigie Coelum, ac inferior seu naturalis Regio est in minima effigie Mundus, quare homo ab antiquis dictus est microcosmus, et quoque vocari potest microuranos.<p>
