513. 悔罪是不是悔改, 可通过下面对悔改的描述推断出来, 也就是说, 除非人意识到, 人不但总体上, 而且每一至微处都是一个罪人, 否则悔改是不可能的。 除非人检查自己, 认识到自己的罪, 因此痛恨自己, 否则没人知道这一点。 但为了获得信而必须宣讲的悔罪与这些毫不相干, 因为它仅仅是思考, 和由此而来的忏悔, 即人生在亚当的罪中, 生在由它而来的罪恶倾向中, 结果神的愤怒临到他, 罪有应得的咒诅, 毁灭和永恒的死亡也临到他。 从这一切明显看出, 这种悔罪不是悔改。 </p>

513. Is this contrition the same as repentance or not? The description of repentance in the sections below will enable you to conclude that repentance is not possible unless we know not only in a general way but also in specific detail that we are sinners. This is something we cannot know unless we examine ourselves, see the sins that are within us, and condemn ourselves on their account. The contrition that preachers say is necessary to our faith has nothing in common with the actions just listed. It is only a thought and a confession that we have been born into the sin of Adam and into an inclination toward the evils that spring from that sin, and that therefore the wrath of God is upon us and we deserve damnation, destruction, and eternal death. Clearly, then, this contrition is not the same as repentance. </p>

513. Whether contrition is the same as repentance or not can be decided from the description of repentance in what follows, namely, that it cannot exist unless a person not only in general terms but also in detail knows that he is a sinner. No one can know this unless he examines himself and sees the sins in himself, and for that reason condemns himself. The contrition, however, which is preached about as being necessary in order to acquire faith, has nothing in common with these actions, for it is merely thinking, and so confession, that one is by birth involved in Adam's sin and prone to the evils that gush forth from that source; as a result, one is subject to the wrath of God, and so deservedly damned and doomed to everlasting death. It is plain from this that contrition of this sort is not repentance. </p>

<p>
513. Whether contrition is repentance or not, may be inferred from the description of repentance given hereafter, where it is shown that repentance is impossible unless man is aware that not only generally but in every least particular he is a sinner; and this no man can know, unless he examines himself, sees the evils that are in him, and condemns himself on account of them. But the contrition that is declared to be necessary to faith, has nothing in common with all this; for it is merely the thought and the confession therefrom, that man is born into the sin of Adam, and into a proclivity to the evils springing from it; consequently, that the wrath of God is upon him, and therefore a well-deserved damnation, doom, and eternal death. From all this it is plain that contrition is not repentance. </p>

513. Whether this contrition is repentance or not, may be determined from the description of repentance in what follows. It will be seen that it can have no existence unless a man knows, not only in general but also in particular, that he is a sinner; and this no one can know unless he examines himself, sees the evils that are in him, and condemns himself on account of them. But this contrition that is declared necessary to faith involves none of these acts. For it consists merely in thinking and then confessing that man was born into Adam's sin, and into a propensity to the evils originating from it, so that he is under the wrath of God, and deserving of damnation, the curse and eternal death. It is evident, therefore, that this contrition is not repentance. </p>

513. [Primum momentum est,] Numeri CONTRITIO ILLA SIT POENITENTIA, VEL NON, concludi potest a Poenitentiae descriptione in sequentibus, quod non dabilis sit, nisi homo non modo universaliter sed etiam singulariter sciat quod peccator sit; quod nemo scire potest, nisi exploret se, et videat illa apud se, et propterea se damnet. Contritio autem illa, quae praedicatur necessaria ad fidem, nihil commune tenet cum illis, nam est modo cogitatio et inde confessio, quod in peccatum Adami, et in proclivitatem ad mala inde scaturientia natus sit, et quod propterea ei sit ira Dei, et inde ex merito damnatio, devotio, et mors aeterna: ex quibus patet, quod contritio haec non sit poenitentia. </p>
