742. While they were still engaged in that, a messenger came from the prince with an invitation to them to break bread with him. Two court attendants with the messenger were carrying clothes of fine linen. They said, "Please put these on, because none are allowed at the table of our prince if they are not wearing the clothes of heaven. "
<p>They put on the clothes and went with their angel. They were brought into a large walled area where people from the palace could take walks. There they waited for the prince to arrive. The angel introduced them to dignitaries and governors who were also awaiting the prince's arrival.
<p>After a little while the doors opened. They saw the prince coming through the wider door to the west in a formal and splendid procession. First came his privy councillors, then the members of his cabinet, and then the highest officials in his court. In among the officials was the prince himself. After him came other distinguished members of the court, and then less distinguished members, and last of all the attendants. There were around a hundred and twenty in the procession all told.
</p>
<p>
[2] The angel was standing in front of the ten newcomers, who now looked like visiting dignitaries in their fine clothes. Then the angel stepped forward toward the prince, bringing them along, and respectfully presented them. The prince, without stopping, said to them, "Come break bread with me. "
<p>They followed him into a dining room. There they saw a table magnificently laid out. In the middle of the table there was a tall pyramid made of gold with a hundred small dishes held on three different tiers of its structure. These dishes held sweet breads and wine jellies, and other delicacies made with bread and wine. A wine that was like nectar was bubbling up through the center of the pyramid like a fountain; from the top of the pyramid the wine split into many flowing streams and filled goblets below. To the sides of the tall pyramid there were various heavenly forms made out of gold; these held large and small plates that were full of foods of all kinds. The heavenly forms that held these large and small plates were forms made with a wisdom and technique that no drawing or words in the physical world could possibly capture. The large and small plates were made of silver; forms were embossed on their edges that were similar to the forms on the stands that held them, only flatter. Each cup was made out of a translucent gem. This was what the table setting was like. </p>

742. While this was going on, a messenger arrived from the prince, who invited them to eat with him. At the same time two attendants of the court brought them clothes of fine linen, and said: 'Put these on, because no one is admitted to the prince's table unless he wears the clothes of heaven.'<p>So they fastened these on with a girdle and followed their angel, who brought them into an open courtyard of the palace, where people could stroll, to wait for the prince. There the angel introduced them to groups of important people and governors, who were also awaiting the prince. After a short time they saw the doors thrown open, and through a rather wider door on the west the prince entered with a dignified procession. He was preceded by his privy councillors, then came his treasury councillors, and after them the leading members of the court. In their midst walked the prince, followed by courtiers of various ranks, and finally the attendants. Altogether they numbered a hundred and twenty.</p>
<p>
[2] The angel was standing in front of the ten newcomers, who were dressed to look like residents. He approached the prince with them and respectfully introduced them. The prince without pausing in his progress said to them: 'Come and eat with me.'<p>They followed him into the dining-room and saw a table magnificently set out. In the middle was a lofty pyramid of gold, with a hundred dishes ranged in three rows on their stands. On the dishes were sugared cakes and crystallised grape-juice, together with other delicacies made of bread and wine. Through the middle of the pyramid burst a sort of fountain of wine like nectar; the liquid spread out from the top of the pyramid, and filled goblets. By the side of this lofty pyramid were various heavenly designs made of gold, on which were plates and saucers filled with food of every kind. The heavenly designs on which the plates and saucers stood were artistic representations based on wisdom, which no art in the world could create, nor can they be described in worldly language. The plates and saucers were of silver, engraved all round with designs on a plane surface similar to those of their supports. The goblets were made of translucent gems. Such was the setting of the table. </p>

742. While they were thus engaged, there came a messenger from the prince, who invited them to eat bread with him; and at the same time two court attendants brought garments of white linen, and said, "Put these on; for no one is admitted to the prince's table unless he is clothed in the garments of heaven." <p>They put on the garments and accompanied their angel; and they were conducted into a corridor, a promenade of the palace, where they waited for the prince; and there they were brought by the angel into companionship with great men and governors, who also were waiting for the prince. And behold, after half an hour the doors were opened, and through a wider one on the west they saw him enter in the order and pomp of a procession. Before him came his privy counselors, after these his chamberlains, and after these again the chief officers of his court. In the midst of the latter was the prince, behind him courtiers of various rank, and last of all the lifeguards. In all they numbered one hundred and twenty.
</p>
<p>
[2] The angel standing before the ten new-comers, who from their dress were seen to be visitors, approached the prince with them and reverently presented them; and the prince without stopping in the procession, said to them, "Come and take bread with me." <p>They followed him into the dining-hall, where they saw a table magnificently prepared. In the center of it was a high pyramid of gold, having on its shelves in triple order a hundred dishes containing sweet cakes, solidified musts of wines, and other delicacies made of bread and wine. Through the middle of the pyramid there welled up, as it were, a fountain bubbling over with nectareous wine, a stream of which spread itself from the top of the pyramid and filled the cups. At the side of this high pyramid were various heavenly projections of gold, on which were dishes and plates loaded with every kind of food. These heavenly projections on which the plates and dishes rested, were forms of art derived from wisdom, which could not be executed in the world by any art, or described in any language. The dishes and plates were of silver, engraved around with forms resembling those on their supports; the cups were of transparent gems. Thus was the table furnished. </p>

742. While they were thus employed, there came a messenger from the prince with an invitation to them to eat bread with him. At the same time two attendants of the court brought garments of fine linen and said: "Put these on; for no one is admitted to the prince's table unless he is clothed with the garments of heaven." So they put them on and, accompanying the angel, were conducted to the portico, or the palace walk where they waited for the prince. There the angel introduced them to the company and conversation of great men and rulers who were also waiting for the prince. In about an hour the doors were opened, and through one wider than the rest on the western side they saw him enter with processional pomp and ceremony. Before him went his familiar councilors, and after them his privy councilors, and next the chief officers of the court. In the midst of these was the prince, and following him were courtiers of various rank, and lastly the guards; in all they numbered one hundred and twenty.</p>
<p>
[2] The angel, leading the ten strangers who now appeared from their dress as resident guests of the palace approached the prince and reverently presented them; and the prince, without stopping the procession, said to them: "Come and eat bread with me." They followed him into the dining-hall, where they saw a table magnificently prepared. In the centre was a lofty golden pyramid, and neatly arranged down its three sides were a hundred salvers, bearing sweet cakes and crystallized wines, with other delicacies made of bread and wine. Up through the centre of the pyramid there flowed as it were a leaping fountain of delicious wine, whose stream divided at the summit and was drawn off into cups. Alongside this high pyramid were various heavenly ornaments of gold bearing large and small plates and dishes laden with food of every kind. The heavenly ornaments bearing these plates were works of art inspired by wisdom, which could not be reproduced by any art in the world nor described by any words. The plates and dishes were of silver, with carvings around them exactly similar to those on their supports; and the cups were of transparent gems. Thus was the table furnished. </p>

742. Cum in his erant, venit nuntius a Principe, qui invitavit illos ad comedendum panem secum; et simul tunc duo satellites aulae apportabant vestes byssi, et dixerunt, induite has, quia nemo ad mensam Principis admittitur nisi indutus vestibus Coeli; et accinxerunt se, et comitati sunt Angelum suum, et introducebantur in Hypethrum, ambulatorium Palatii, et exspectabant Principem; et ibi Angelus insertabat illos consortiis cum Magnatibus et Moderatoribus, qui etiam praestolabantur Principem: et ecce post horulam apertae sunt fores, et per unam latiorem ab Occidente viderunt Ejus introitum in ordine et pompa processionis: praeibant illum Consiliarii a latere, post hos Consiliarii a cameris, et post hos Primarii ex aula: in horum medio fuit Princeps, et post illum aulici variae distinctionis, et ultimo satellites; omnes connumerati ad centum et viginti.</p>

[2] Angelus stans ante decem novos advenas, ex vestitu tunc apparentes ut inquilini, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
accessit cum illis ad Principem, et reverenter adduxit illos; et Princeps in procedendo non moratus, dixit illis, venite mecum ad panem, et sequuti sunt in Triclinium, et viderunt Mensam magnifice apparatam, in medio ejus excelsam Pyramidem ex auro cum centum scutellis in triplici ordine super formis suis, super quibus erant panes sacharini, et musta vinorum concreta, cum aliis lautitiis ex pane et vino confectis; ac per mediam Pyramidem scaturivit sicut fons saliens cum vino nectareo, cujus vena ex summitate Pyramidis dispersit se, et cyathos implevit. Ad latera hujus excelsae Pyramidis erant variae formae coelestes ex auro, super quibus erant patinae et patellae cibis omnis generis refertae: formae coelestes, super quibus erant patinae et patellae, erant formae artis ex sapientia, quae in Mundo non aliqua arte exarari, nec voce describi possunt: patinae et patellae erant ex argento, circumcaelatae similibus formis in plano cum sustentaculis suis; cyathi erant ex gemmis pellucentibus: talis erat apparatus Mensae.<p>
