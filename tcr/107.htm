<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第107节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>107</b>. （9）从今往后，在基督徒当中，若不信主神救主，单单靠近祂，没人能进入天堂。我们在以赛亚书中读到：<br />看哪，我造新天新地，从前的不再被记念，也不再追想；看哪，我要造耶路撒冷为人所喜，造其中的居民为人所乐。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.17.htm">以赛亚书65:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.18.htm">18</a>）<br />在启示录，我们读到：<br />我看见一个新天新地，我又看见圣城耶路撒冷由神那里从天而降，就如新妇为丈夫那样预备好了；坐宝座的那位说，看哪，我将一切都更新了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.1.htm">启示录21:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.5.htm">5</a>）<br />我们在很多地方读到，只有那些被记在羔羊生命册上的人才会进入天堂（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.8.htm">启示录13:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.17:8.htm">17:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.20:12.htm">20:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.27.htm">21:27</a>）。此处提及的“天”并非指我们眼见的天，而是指天使天堂，“耶路撒冷”并非指从天而降的城，而是指要从主那里从天使天堂而降的教会；“羔羊生命册”也并非指要打开的、在天堂所写的书，而是指来自主并论述主的圣言。本章前几节已证明、确认并证实，被称为创造者和父的耶和华神降下来披上人身，是为了人能靠近祂，与祂结合。有谁能通过靠近其灵魂而接受一个人？如何做到？靠近他，面对面注视、嘴对觜交谈的，不正是这个人自己吗？父神与儿子的情形也一样，因为父神在儿子里面，如同灵魂在它的身体里面。<br />以下圣言经文证实，人必须信神，救主：<br />神爱世人，甚至将祂的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信祂的，不致灭亡，反得永生。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.16.htm">约翰福音3:16</a>）<br />信子的人，不被定罪；不信的人，罪已经定了，因为他不信神独生子的名。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.18.htm">约翰福音3:18</a>）<br />信子的人有永生，不信子的人不得见永生，神的震怒常在他身上。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.36.htm">约翰福音3:36</a>）<br />神的粮就是那从天上降下来赐生命给世界的。到我这里来的，必定不饿；信我的，永远不渴。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.33.htm">约翰福音6:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.35.htm">35</a>）<br />我父的意思是叫一切见子而信的人得永生。并且在末日我要叫他复活。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.40.htm">约翰福音6:40</a>）。<br />众人问祂说，我们当行什么，才算做神的工呢？耶稣回答说，信神所差来的，这就是做神的工。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.28.htm">约翰福音6:28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.29.htm">29</a>）<br />我实实在在地告诉你们，信我的人有永生。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.47.htm">约翰福音6:47</a>）<br />耶稣高声说，人若渴了，可以到我这里来喝。信我的人，就如经上所说，从他腹中要流出活水的江河来。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.37.htm">约翰福音7:37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.38.htm">38</a>）<br />你们若不信我永在，必要死在罪中。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.24.htm">约翰福音8:24</a>）<br />耶稣对她说，复活在我，生命也在我。信我的人，虽然死了，也必复活。凡活着信我的人必永远不死。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.25.htm">约翰福音11:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.26.htm">26</a>）。<br />耶稣说，我到世上来，乃是光，叫凡信我的，不住在黑暗里。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.46.htm">约翰福音12:46</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.12.htm">8:12</a>）<br />你们应当趁着有光，信从这光，使你们成为光明之子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.36.htm">约翰福音12:36</a>）<br />我们读到：<br />他们要在主里面，主也在他们里面。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">约翰福音14:20</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.1.htm">15:1</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.5.htm">5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.23.htm">17:23</a>）<br />他们通过信做到这一点。保罗向犹太人和希利尼人传讲向神悔改、信我们的主耶稣基督（<a href="http://39-27.cn/徒20.21.htm">使徒行传20:21</a>）。耶稣说：<br />我就是道路、真理、生命；若不藉着我，没有人能到父那里去。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">约翰福音14:6</a>）<br />以下经文证明，凡信子的也信父，因为如前所述，父在祂里面，正如灵魂在身体里面：<br />若是认识我，也就认识我的父。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.19.htm">约翰福音8:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.7.htm">14:7</a>）<br />人看见我，就是看见那差我来的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.45.htm">约翰福音12:45</a>）<br />又说，你不能看见我的面，因为人见我的面不能存活。<br />原因在于：<br />人见父的面不能存活。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出33.20.htm">出埃及记33:20</a>）<br />因此，主说：<br />从来没有人看见神。只有在父怀里的独生子将祂表明出来。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.18.htm">约翰福音1:18</a>）<br />没有人看见过父，惟独与父同在的，祂看见过父。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.46.htm">约翰福音6:46</a>）<br />你们从来没有听见祂的声音，也没有看见祂的形像。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.37.htm">约翰福音5:37</a>）<br />至于那些对主一无所知的人们，像三大洲中的那两大洲，即亚洲人和非洲人，更不说印度群岛，他们若信一位神，并照着他们自己的宗教戒律生活，也能凭他们的信仰和生活而得救。罪会归给那些知道的人，而不是那些无知者，就象瞎子撞到东西上不应受责怪一样。因为主说：<br />你们若瞎了眼，就没有罪了。但如今你们说，你们能看见，所以你们的罪还在。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.41.htm">约翰福音9:41</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #107 </h4>
<p>
107. (9)從現在起, 基督徒若非相信主上帝拯救者並且單單歸向祂, 就不能進入天國。
<p>在『以賽亞書』中, 我們讀到:看啊, 我造新天新地, 先前的不再被紀念, 也不再追想; 看, 我要使耶路撒冷歡喜, 其民快樂(<a href="3927/isaiah_65_17.htm">以賽亞書65:17-18</a>)。在『啟示錄』, 我們讀到:我看見一個新天和一個新地, 我又看見神聖的耶路撒冷由上帝從天降下, 預備好,如同一個新娘為她丈夫; 坐寶座的那位說:"看哪, 我要將一切更新"(<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">啟示錄21:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_5.htm">5</a>)。我們在多處讀到, 只有那些記在羔羊生命冊上的將升天(<a href="3927/revelation_13_8.htm">啟示錄13:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_17_8.htm">17:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">20:12</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_27.htm">21:27</a>)。上面所講的"天", 並非有形之天或肉眼所見之天, 而是天人所在的天國。所說的"耶路撒冷", 並非從天空降下的一座城市, 而是從主之天國降下的教會。"羔羊生命冊"並非在天上寫的,無人打開的一本書卷, 而是指從主而來並關於祂的聖言。
<p>實際上, 這個被稱為"創造者"和"父"的耶和華上帝降臨,並取了一個人的樣式顯現, 就是為了祂能被接近,人類能與祂聯合。這些在本章之前的內容裡已被確定和證明。
<p>有誰去接近某人, 對他的靈魂說話的嗎？怎麼做得到呢？應該是到這人跟前, 眼對眼相看, 面對面交談吧。同樣, 父上帝和子也是類似, 因為父上帝在子之中, 如同靈魂在身體之中。
<p>[2]下列章節教導我們, 當信主上帝拯救者:
<p>上帝愛世人, 甚至將祂的獨生子賜給他們, 叫一切信祂的, 不致滅亡, 反得永生(<a href="3927/john_3_16.htm">約翰福音3:16</a>)。信子的人, 不被定罪; 不信的人,罪已經定了, 因為他不信上帝獨生子的名(<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">約翰福音3:18</a>)。信子的人有永生, 不信子的人不得見永生, 上帝的震怒常在他身上(<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">約翰福音3:36</a>)。上帝的糧就是那從天上降下來賜生命給世界的。到我這裡來的,必定不餓; 信我的,永遠不渴(<a href="3927/john_6_33.htm">約翰福音6:33</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_35.htm">35</a>)。我父的意思是叫一切見子而信的人得永生。並且在末日我要叫他復活(<a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">約翰福音6:40</a>)。眾人問祂說:"我們當行什麼, 才算作上帝的工呢？"耶穌回答說:"信上帝所差來的, 這就是作上帝的工"(<a href="3927/john_6_28.htm">約翰福音6:28-29</a>)。我實實在在的告訴你們, 信我的人有永生(<a href="3927/john_6_47.htm">約翰福音6:47</a>)。耶穌站著高聲說:"人若渴了, 可以到我這裡來喝。信我的人, 就如經上所說, 從他腹中要流出活水的江河來"(<a href="3927/john_7_37.htm">約翰福音7:37-38</a>)。你們若不信我是, 必要死在罪中(<a href="3927/john_8_24.htm">約翰福音8:24</a>)。耶穌對他說:"我是復活, 我是生命。信我的人, 雖然死了, 也必復活。凡活著信我的人,必永遠不死 (<a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">約翰福音11:25-26</a>)。耶穌說:"我到世上來,乃是光, 叫凡信我的不住在黑暗裡。"(<a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">約翰福音12:46</a>; <a href="3927/john_8_12.htm">8:12</a>)。你們應當趁著有光, 信從這光, 使你們成為光明之子(<a href="3927/john_12_36.htm">約翰福音12:36</a>)。人們當活在主裡面, 主就是他們裡面(<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">約翰福音14:20</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_1.htm">15:1-5</a>; <a href="3927/john_17_23.htm">17:23</a>), 這要通過信仰來達成。對猶太人和希利尼人證明, 當向上帝悔改,信靠我們的主耶穌基督(<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_20_21.htm">使徒行傳20:21</a>)。耶穌說:"我就是道路,真理,生命, 若不藉著我, 沒有人能到父那裡去"(<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">約翰福音14:6</a>)。
<p>[3]凡信子的,就必信父, 如本章之前所述, 父在子中,如同靈魂在身體之中。下列章節顯然可知:
<p>你若認識我, 也就認識我的父(<a href="3927/john_8_19.htm">約翰福音8:19</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_7.htm">14:7</a>)。人看見我, 就是看見那差我來的(<a href="3927/john_12_45.htm">約翰福音12:45</a>)。這是因為沒有人能看見父而存活(<a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">出埃及記33:20</a>)。因此, 主說, 從來沒有人看見上帝, 只有在父懷裡的獨生子將祂表明出來(<a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">約翰福音1:18</a>)。沒有人看見過父, 惟獨從父來的, 祂看見過父(<a href="3927/john_6_46.htm">約翰福音6:46</a>)。你們從來沒有聽見祂的聲音, 也沒有看見祂的形像(<a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">約翰福音5:37</a>)。
<p>至於那些對主一無所知的人們, 像那些在亞洲和非洲的人們, 倘若他們信一位上帝, 並按照他們自己信仰的誡命去生活, 會因他們的信仰和生活而得救。屬靈的獎懲適用於那些知道的人, 而不適用於那些不知者; 正如我們不能責怪瞎子被絆倒。因為主說:"你們若瞎了眼, 就沒有罪了。但如今你們說你們能看見, 所以你們的罪還在"(<a href="3927/john_9_41.htm">約翰福音9:41</a>)。 </p>

</h4>
<p>
107. 9. From now on, no Christians will go to heaven unless they believe in the Lord God the Savior and turn to him alone. We read in Isaiah, "Behold, I am creating a new heaven and a new earth, and the earlier heaven and earth will not be remembered or overwhelm the heart. Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a rejoicing and its people a joy" (<a href="3927/isaiah_65_17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>). In the Book of Revelation we read, I saw a new heaven and a new earth, and I saw the holy Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared like a bride for her husband. And the One sitting on the throne said, "Behold, I will make all things new" (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_5.htm">5</a>). A number of times we read that no one can come into heaven except the people who have been written in the Lamb's book of life (<a href="3927/revelation_13_8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_17_8.htm">17:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">20:12</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_27.htm">21:27</a>). "Heaven" in these passages does not mean the visible heaven or sky that is before our eyes; it means the angelic heaven. "Jerusalem" does not mean some city from the sky; it means the church that will descend out of the angelic heaven from the Lord. "The Lamb's book of life" does not mean a book written in heaven that will be opened; it means the Word, which is from the Lord and is about him.
<p>In fact, the reason why Jehovah God, who is called "the Creator" and "the Father," came down and took on a human manifestation was so that we could turn to him and form a partnership with him, a point I have supported, proven, and established with the previous statements in this chapter.
<p>When we go to see someone, we do not go to the person's soul. Who would be able to go to someone's soul? No, we go to the actual person. We see the person eye to eye and talk with the person face to face. It is the same with God the Father and the Son because God the Father is present in the Son the way a soul is present in its body.
</p>
<p>
[2] The following passages in the Word teach that we have to believe in the Lord God the Savior:
<p>God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son so that everyone who believes in him would not perish but would have eternal life. (<a href="3927/john_3_16.htm">John 3:16</a>)
<p>Those who believe in the Son are not judged; but those who do not believe have already been judged because they have not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. (<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>)
<p>Those who believe in the Son have eternal life. Those who do not believe in the Son will not see life; instead God's anger will remain upon them. (<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>)
<p>The bread of God is the One who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. Those who come to me will never hunger and those who believe in me will never thirst. (<a href="3927/john_6_33.htm">John 6:33</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_35.htm">35</a>)
<p>This is the will of the One who sent me, that all who see the Son and believe in him should have eternal life, and I will revive them on the last day. (<a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>)
<p>They said to Jesus, "What shall we do to perform the works of God?" Jesus answered, "This is God's work, to believe in the One whom the Father sent. " (<a href="3927/john_6_28.htm">John 6:28-29</a>)
<p>Truly I say to you, those who believe in me have eternal life. (<a href="3927/john_6_47.htm">John 6:47</a>)
<p>Jesus cried out, saying, "If any are thirsty, they must come to me and drink. If any believe in me, rivers of living water will flow out of their bellies. " (<a href="3927/john_7_37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>)
<p>Unless you have believed that I am [he], you will die in your sins. (<a href="3927/john_8_24.htm">John 8:24</a>)
<p>Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even if they die they will live. And everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. (<a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>)
<p>Jesus said, "I have come into the world as a light so that all who believe in me will not remain in darkness. " (<a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">John 12:46</a>; <a href="3927/john_8_12.htm">8:12</a>)
<p>As long as you have the light, believe in the light so that you may be children of the light. (<a href="3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>)
<p>People will live in the Lord and the Lord in them (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_15.htm">15:15</a>; <a href="3927/john_17_23.htm">17:23</a>), a situation that is brought about by faith.
<p>To both Jews and Greeks Paul proclaimed repentance before God and belief in our Lord Jesus Christ. (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_20_21.htm">Acts of the Apostles 20:21</a>)
<p>I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>)
</p>
<p>
[3] Those who believe in the Son believe in the Father, since as we said above, the Father is in the Son like a soul in a body. The following passages make this clear:
<p>If you had known me you would have known my Father also. (<a href="3927/john_8_19.htm">John 8:19</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_7.htm">14:7</a>)
<p>Those who see me see the One who sent me. (<a href="3927/john_12_45.htm">John 12:45</a>)
<p>Those who receive me receive the One who sent me. (<a href="3927/john_13_20.htm">John 13:20</a>)
<p>This is because no one can see the Father and live (<a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>), which is why the Lord says,
<p>No one has ever seen God. The only begotten Son, who is close to the Father's heart, has made him visible. (<a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>)
<p>No one has seen the Father except the One who is with the Father. He has seen the Father. (<a href="3927/john_6_46.htm">John 6:46</a>)
<p>You have never heard the voice of the Father or seen what he looks like. (<a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>)
<p>There are those of course who know nothing about the Lord, such as most people who are in those two great parts of the world called Asia and Africa, as well as in the Indies, for example. If they believe in one God and follow the principles of their religion in their lives they are saved by their faith and by their life. Spiritual credit or blame applies only to those who know; it does not apply to those who do not. We do not blame the blind for tripping. As the Lord says, "If you had been blind you would have had no sin; but now that you say you see, your sin remains" (<a href="3927/john_9_41.htm">John 9:41</a>). </p>

107. (ix) FROM THIS TIME ON NO ONE FROM CHRISTIAN COUNTRIES CAN COME INTO HEAVEN, UNLESS HE BELIEVES IN THE LORD GOD THE SAVIOUR, AND APPROACHES HIM ALONE.<p>We read in Isaiah:<p>Behold, I create a new heaven and a new earth, and the former ones shall not be remembered, neither shall they rise above the heart, and behold, I shall make Jerusalem an exultation, and its people happiness, <a href="3927/isaiah_65_17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-18</a>.<p>and in Revelation:<p>I saw a new heaven and a new earth, and I saw the holy Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride for her husband; and He that sat on the throne said, Behold, I shall make all things new, <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_5.htm">5</a>.<p>We read in many places that only those who are written down in the Book of Life of the Lamb will enter heaven (<a href="3927/revelation_13_8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_17_8.htm">17:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">20:12</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_27.htm">21:27</a>). Heaven there does not mean the heaven we see with our eyes, but the heaven of the angels; Jerusalem is no city coming out of the sky, but a church which will come down from the Lord out of the other heaven; and the Book of Life of the Lamb does not mean some book written in heaven which is to be opened, but the Word, which is from the Lord and about Him. In the preceding sections of this chapter the doctrine that Jehovah God, who is called the Creator and Father, came down and took upon Himself human form, in order that He could be approached and be joined, has been confirmed, proved and established. Does anyone on approaching a person address himself to his soul? How could one do so? Rather he addresses himself to the person whom he sees before him, and speaks to him directly face to face. The case is similar with God the Father and God the Son, since God the Father is in the Son, as the soul is in the body.</p>
<p>
[2] The following passages in the Word establish that one must believe in the Lord God the Saviour:<p>God so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, so that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life, <a href="3927/john_3_15.htm">John 3:15-16</a>.<p>He who believes in the Son is not judged, but he who does not believe has already been judged, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God, <a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>.<p>He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; but he who does not believe in the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God will rest upon him, <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>.<p>The bread of God is that which comes from heaven, and gives life to the world; he who comes to me shall not be hungry, and he who believes in me shall never be thirsty, <a href="3927/john_6_33.htm">John 6:33</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_35.htm">35</a>.<p>This is the will of Him who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him should have everlasting life, and I should raise him up on the last day, <a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>.<p>They said to Jesus, What shall we do to perform God's work? Jesus answered, This is God's work, to believe in Him whom the Father has sent, <a href="3927/john_6_28.htm">John 6:28-29</a>.<p>In truth, I say to you, he who believes in me has everlasting life, <a href="3927/john_6_47.htm">John 6:47</a>.<p>Jesus cried out saying, If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. If anyone believes in me, streams of living water will flow from his belly, <a href="3927/john_7_37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>.<p>If you have not believed that I am, you will die in your sins, <a href="3927/john_8_24.htm">John 8:24</a>.<p>Jesus said, I am the resurrection and life; he who believes in me, though he die, shall live; but everyone who lives and believes in me shall not ever die, <a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>.<p>Jesus said, I have come as a light into the world, so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in darkness, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">John 12:46</a>; <a href="3927/john_8_12.htm">8:12</a>.<p>So long as you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may be sons of light, <a href="3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>.<p>We read that they will abide in the Lord and the Lord in them (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_1.htm">15:1-5</a>; <a href="3927/john_17_23.htm">17:23</a>), which they can do through faith.<p>Paul preached both to Jews and to gentiles repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, <a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_20_21.htm">Acts of the Apostles 20:21</a>.<p>I am the way, truth and life; no one comes to the Father except through me, <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] The following passages prove that he who believes in the Son believes in the Father, since, as said before, the Father is in Him, just as the soul is in the body:<p>If you knew me, you would also know my Father, <a href="3927/john_8_19.htm">John 8:19</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_7.htm">14:7</a>.<p>He who sees me sees Him who sent me, <a href="3927/john_12_45.htm">John 12:45</a>.<p>He who receives me receives Him who sent me, <a href="3927/john_13_20.htm">John 13:20</a>.<p>The reason is that no one can see the Father and live (<a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). For this reason the Lord says:<p>No one has ever seen God; His only-begotten Son who is in the Father's revealed Him, <a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>.<p>No one has seen the Father, except Him who is with the Father; He has seen the Father, <a href="3927/john_6_46.htm">John 6:46</a>.<p>You have never heard the Father's voice, nor have you seen His appearance, <a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>.<p>But those who do not know anything about the Lord, like those in two of the three continents, Asia and Africa, not to mention the Indies, if they believe in one God, and live in accordance with the commandments of their own religion, are saved by their faith and their life. Sin is imputed to those who know, not to those who are ignorant, just as blind people who knock into things are not blamed. For the Lord says:<p>If you were blind, you would not have any sin; but now you say that you can see, therefore your sin remains, <a href="3927/john_9_41.htm">John 9:41</a>. </p>

107. (9) Hereafter no one from among Christians enters heaven unless he believes in the Lord God the Savior, and approaches Him alone. We read in Isaiah: <p>Behold I create a new heaven and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered nor come into mind; and behold, I will create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy (Isa.<a href="3927/isaiah_65_17.htm">65:17, 18</a>); <p>and in Revelation: <p>I saw a new heaven and a new earth: and I saw the holy Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, made ready as a bride for her husband. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold I make all things new (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1, 2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_5.htm">5</a>) and in other places: <p>That no others should enter heaven than those who were written in the Lamb's book of Life (<a href="3927/revelation_13_8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_17_8.htm">17:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">20:12</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_27.htm">21:27</a>). <p>By the "heaven" here mentioned the heaven visible to our eyes is not meant, but the angelic heaven; by "Jerusalem" no city coming down out of the sky is meant, but a church that is to descend from the Lord out of the angelic heaven, and "the Lamb's book of Life" means not a book written in heaven, which is to be opened, but the Word, which is from the Lord and which treats of the Lord. In the preceding sections of this chapter it has been proved, authenticated, and established that Jehovah God, who is called the creator and the Father, descended and assumed a Human in order that He might be approached by man and be conjoined to man. For does anyone get near to a man by approaching his soul? Can that be done? It is the man himself who is approached, who is seen face to face, and who is talked with mouth to mouth. It is the same with God the Father and the Son; since God the Father is in the Son as a soul is in its body.
</p>
<p>
[2] That the Lord God the savior is he in whom men ought to believe is evident from the following passages in the Word: <p>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him may not perish, but may have eternal life (<a href="3927/john_3_15.htm">John 3:15, 16</a>). <p>He that believeth in the Son is not judged; but he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God (<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>). <p>He that believeth in the son hath eternal life; but he that believeth not the son shall not see life, but the anger of God abideth on him (<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>). <p>The bread of God is He that cometh down out of heaven, and giveth life unto the world. He that cometh to Me shall not hunger; and he that believeth in Me shall never thirst (<a href="3927/john_6_33.htm">John 6:33</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_35.htm">35</a>). <p>This is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who beholdeth the Son and believeth in Him may have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day (<a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>). <p>They said to Jesus, What must we do that we may work the works of God? Jesus answered, This is the work of God, that ye believe in Him whom He hath sent (<a href="3927/john_6_28.htm">John 6:28, 29</a>). <p>Verily, I say unto you, he that believeth in Me hath everlasting life (<a href="3927/john_6_47.htm">John 6:47</a>). <p>Jesus cried saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink. He that believeth in Me out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water (<a href="3927/john_7_37.htm">John 7:37, 38</a>). <p>Unless ye believe that I am, ye shall die in your sins (<a href="3927/john_8_24.htm">John 8:24</a>). <p>Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in Me, though he die, shall live and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die (<a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25, 26</a>). <p>Jesus said, I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth in Me may not abide in darkness (<a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">John 12:46</a>; <a href="3927/john_8_12.htm">8:12</a>). <p>While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may be sons of the light (<a href="3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>). <p>The Lord also said that the disciples should abide in Him, and He in them (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_1.htm">15:1-5</a>; <a href="3927/john_17_23.htm">17:23</a>); <p>which is done by faith: <p>Paul testified both to the Jews and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_20_21.htm">Acts of the Apostles 20:21</a>). <p>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father but by Me (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] That whosoever believes in the son believes in the Father, since, as said above the Father is in him as the soul in the body, is evident from the following passages: <p>If ye had known Me ye would have known My Father also (<a href="3927/john_8_19.htm">John 8:19</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_7.htm">14:7</a>). <p>He that seeth Me, seeth Him that sent Me (<a href="3927/john_12_45.htm">John 12:45</a>). <p>He that receiveth Me, receiveth Him that sent Me (<a href="3927/john_13_20.htm">John 13:20</a>). <p>This is because no one can see the Father and live (<a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). <p>Therefore the Lord says: <p>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father He hath manifested him (<a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>). <p>Not that any man hath seen the Father save He that is with the Father, He hath seen the Father (<a href="3927/john_6_46.htm">John 6:46</a>). <p>Ye have neither heard the voice of the Father at any time, nor seen His form (<a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>). <p>But those who know nothing about the Lord, like most of those in the two divisions of the globe called Asia and Africa, including those in the Indies, provided they believe in one God and live according to the precepts of their religion, are saved by their faith and life; for imputation has reference to those who know, not to those who do not know; as when the blind stumble it is not imputed to them; for the Lord says: <p>If ye were blind ye would not have sin; but now ye say that ye see therefore your sin remaineth (<a href="3927/john_9_41.htm">John 9:41</a>). </p>

107. (9) HEREAFTER NO CHRISTIAN CAN ENTER HEAVEN UNLESS HE BELIEVES ON THE LORD GOD THE SAVIOR, AND APPROACHES HIM ALONE.<p>It is written in Isaiah:<p>"Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind... Behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy" <a href="3927/isaiah_65_17.htm">65:17-18</a>;<p>and in Revelation:<p>"I saw a new heaven and a new earth, and... I saw... the holy...

It has been confirmed, proved and established in the preceding sections of this chapter that Jehovah God, who is called the Creator and Father, descended and assumed the Human in order that men might approach and be united to Him. For who, when he draws near to a man, approaches his soul, or who can do so? He approaches the man himself, whom he sees and addresses face to face.

Qui videt Me, videt Ipsum qui misit Me, <a href="3927/john_12_45.htm">Johannes 12:45</a>. Qui Me suscipit, suscipit Ipsum qui misit Me, <a href="3927/john_13_20.htm">Johannes 13:20</a>. Causa est, quia nemo potest videre Patrem, et vivere, <a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>, quare dicit Dominus, Deum nemo vidit unquam, Unigenitus Filius qui in sinu Patris est, Ille exposuit, <a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">Johannes 1:18</a>. Non Patrem vidit quis, nisi qui est apud Patrem, Hic vidit Patrem, <a href="3927/john_6_46.htm">Johannes 6:46</a>. <sup "fn120_7">7</sup>
Non vocem Patris audivistis unquam, neque speciem Ipsius vidistis, <a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">Johannes 5:37</a>. Illi autem, qui non sciunt aliquid de Domino, ut plerique in duabus Partibus Orbis, Asia et Africa, et quoque in Indiis, hi si credunt in Deum unum et vivunt secundum praecepta Religionis suae, ex sua fide et vita salvantur, nam imputatio est illis qui norunt, et non illis qui ignorant, sicut non est caecis dum impingunt, nam dicit Dominus, Si caeci essetis, non haberetis peccatum, jam vero dicitis quod videatis, ideo peccatum vestrum manet, <a href="3927/john_9_41.htm">Johannes 9:41</a>.<p>
