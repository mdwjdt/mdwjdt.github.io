766. The Lord is present with each and every human being. He exerts insistent pressure on us to receive him. When we do receive him, which occurs when we acknowledge him as our own God, Creator, Redeemer, and Savior, his First Coming occurs [in us], which is the twilight before dawn. From then on, we begin to be enlightened intellectually in spiritual matters and to grow into deeper and deeper wisdom. As we receive this wisdom from the Lord, we move through the morning into midday. The day continues into our old age until we die. Then we come to the Lord himself in heaven. There, although we died old, we are brought back into the morning of our lives, and the rudiments of wisdom that were planted in us while we were in the physical world grow and thrive to eternity. </p>

766. <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
The Lord is present with every person, urging and pressing him to receive Him. And when a person receives Him, which happens when he acknowledges Him as his God, the Creator, Redeemer and Saviour, this is His first coming, and is called twilight. From this time the person begins to have his understanding enlightened as regards spiritual matters, and to advance to more and more inward wisdom. As he receives this wisdom from the Lord, so he advances through morning into day; and he continues in this daylight up to old age and until he dies. After death he comes into heaven to the Lord Himself, and there, for all that he died an old man, he is brought back to the morning of his life, and continues for ever to develop the wisdom which was implanted in him in the natural world.<p>

766. The Lord is present with every man, urging and pressing to be received; and His first coming, which is called the dawn, is when man receives Him, which he does when he acknowledges Him as his God, Creator, Redeemer, and Savior. From this time man's understanding begins to be enlightened in spiritual things, and to advance into a more and more interior wisdom; and as he receives this wisdom from the Lord, he advances through morning into day, and this day lasts with him into old age, even to death; and after death he passes into heaven to the Lord Himself; and there, although he died an old man, he is restored to the morning of his life, and the rudiments of the wisdom implanted in him in the natural world grow to eternity. </p>

The Lord is present with every man, urgent and pressing to be received; and when a man receives Him, by acknowledging Him as his Creator, Redeemer and Savior, then is His first Coming, which is called the dawn. From this time the man, as to his understanding, begins to be enlightened in spiritual things, and to advance to a more interior degree of wisdom. As he receives this wisdom from the Lord, so he progresses through morning into day, and this day continues with him to old age, even till death; and after death he comes into heaven to the Lord Himself. There, although he may have died an old man, he returns to the morning of his life, and continues to develop to eternity the wisdom whose beginnings were first implanted during his life in the natural world.<p>

Dominus apud omnem hominem est praesens, ac urget et instat ut recipiatur, et dum homo recipit illum, quod fit cum agnoscit Ipsum pro suo Deo Creatore, Redemptore, et Salvatore, est primus adventus Ipsius, qui vocatur Diluculum; ex hoc tempore incipit homo quoad intellectum in spiritualibus illustrari, et progredi in sapientiam plus et plus interiorem, et sicut illam a Domino recipit, ita progreditur per mane in Diem, et hic dies perstat apud illum in senium usque ad mortem, et post hanc in Coelum ad Ipsum Dominum venit, et ibi tametsi senex mortuus est, reducitur in mane suae aetatis, ac inchoamenta sapientiae in Mundo naturali implantatae continuat in aeternum.<p>
