<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第345节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>345</b>.由于已概述了构成属灵之信的事物，我现在也概述一下纯属世之信的事物。纯属世之信本质上是一种假充信的坚定信念，也是一种被称为异端信仰的虚假信念。它的各种类型包括：<br />（1）不正当的信，其中虚假与真理混杂。<br />（2）徒有其表之信，出于歪曲的真理；不贞的信，出于各种被玷污的良善。<br />（3）封闭或盲目的信，就是被视为神秘的信，尽管不知道它们是真是假，或是超越理性还是违背理性。<br />（4）不确定的信，就是信多神。<br />（5）独眼的信，就是信他神胜过真神，或对基督徒而言，信其他神胜过信主神，救主。<br />（6）伪信或法利赛人的信，就是嘴上信，心里不信。<br />（7）幻想或颠倒的信，就是通过巧妙的论证看似真理的虚假。</p>

345. 之前簡要列舉了屬靈之信的概要, 我也為純粹屬世之信作簡要概括。這樣的信事實上是假裝的信, 只是堅定的確證而已, 是對偽謬的確證, 被稱為異端之信。其類別如下:(1)假冒之信, 其中偽謬混於真理之中。(2)似是而非之信, 真理被歪曲; 不貞之信, 良善被污染。(3)封閉或盲目之信, 就是信神秘之事, 哪怕不知道它們到底是對是錯, 或者是否合乎理性。(4)飄忽不定之信, 就是信多神。(5)獨眼之信, 就是信他神勝過真神, 或者對基督徒而言, 信其它的勝過信主上帝我們的拯救主。(6)偽善或法利賽之信, 就是嘴上信, 心裡不信。(7)虛構或顛倒之信, 就是利用精巧的論證令偽謬看起來像真理。 </p>

345. Since I have just given a brief list of types of spiritual faith, I will also give a brief list of types of merely earthly faith. Such faith is actually a persuasion that pretends to be faith. It is a false persuasion. It is called heretical faith. Its categories are (1) illegitimate faith, in which false beliefs have been mixed with true ones; (2) promiscuous faith based on truths that have been falsified, and adulterous faith based on good things that have been contaminated; (3) closed or blind faith, which is a faith in mystical things that we believe in, although we do not know whether they are true or false, beyond reason or contrary to it; (4) wandering faith, which is faith in many gods; (5) half-blind faith, which is faith in some other god besides the true one, or among Christians, faith in someone else besides the Lord God our Savior; (6) hypocritical or pharisaical faith, which is faith of the mouth but not of the heart; and (7) imaginary and backwards faith, which presents falsity as truth and bolsters it with clever argumentation. </p>

<p>
345. Having given a summary of the things which go to make up spiritual faith, I shall now give too a summary of the things which go to make up purely natural faith. This is essentially a firm conviction which pretends to be faith, but is a conviction of falsity, known as heretical faith. Its various types are: (1) Spurious faith, in which falsities are mixed with truths. (2) Meretricious faith coming from falsified truths, and adulterous faith coming from different kinds of adulterated good. (3) Concealed or blind faith, which is faith in mysteries which are believed in, despite ignorance whether they are true or false, or whether they are above the level of reason or contrary to it. (4) Erratic faith, which is in a plurality of gods. (5) One-eyed faith, which is in some god other than the true one, and in the case of Christians in a god other than the Lord God the Saviour. (6) Hypocritical or Pharisaical faith, faith, which is a faith of the lips, but not the heart. (7) Imaginary or upside-down faith, which is falsity made by clever arguments to seem like truth. </p>

<p>
345. As the constituents of spiritual faith have been presented in a summary, so also shall those of merely natural faith, which in itself is a persuasion counterfeiting faith, and a persuasion of what is false, which is called heretical faith. It may be designated as follows: <p>1. Spurious faith, in which falsities are mixed with truths. <p>2. Meretricious faith from truths falsified, and adulterous faith from goods adulterated. <p>3. Closed or blind faith, which is a faith in things mystical that are believed, although it is not known whether they are true or false, or whether they are above reason or contrary to it. <p>4. Wandering faith, which is a faith in several Gods. <p>5. Purblind faith, which is a faith in some other than the true God, and among Christians in any but the Lord God the Savior. <p>6. Hypocritical or Pharisaic faith, which is a faith of the lips and not of the heart. <p>7. Visionary and distorted faith, which is falsity made to appear like truth by ingenious confirmation of it. </p>

345. Since a summary of what constitutes spiritual faith has been given, a summary of what constitutes merely natural faith will also be given. In itself, this is a persuasion counterfeiting faith, and is a persuasion of what is false, and is called heretical faith. Its designations are:<p>1. Spurious faith, in which falsities are mixed with truths.<p>2. Meretricious faith, from truths falsified, and adulterous faith from goods defiled.<p>3. Closed or blind faith which is a faith in things mystical, which are believed, but without any discernment whether they are true or false, or whether they transcend reason or are contrary to it.<p>4. Wandering faith which is a faith in several gods.<p>5. Purblind faith, which is a faith in any other than the true God, and, among Christians, in any but the Lord God, the Savior.<p>6. Hypocritical or pharisaical faith, which is a faith of the lips, and not of the heart.<p>7. Visionary and perverted faith, or falsity made to appear as truth by ingenious confirmation. </p>

345. Quoniam in summario adducta sunt illa quae Fidei spiritualis sunt, in summario etiam adducentur illa quae Fidei mere naturalis sunt, quae in se est persuasio mentiens fidem, et est persuasio falsi et vocatur Fides haeretica: Denominationes ejus sunt 1. Fides spuria, in qua falsa commixta sunt veris. 2. Fides meretrix, ex falsificatis veris, et adultera ex adulteratis bonis. 3. Fides occlusa aut caeca, quae est rerum mysticarum, quae creduntur, tametsi nescitur num sint vera vel falsa, aut num sint supra rationem vel contra illam. 4. Fides erratica, quae est in plures Deos. 5. Fides lusca, quae est in alium Deum quam in Verum, et apud Christianos quam in Dominum Deum Salvatorem. 6. Fides hypocritica seu pharisaica, quae est oris et non cordis. 7. Fides visionaria et praepostera, quae est apparentia falsi sicut veri ex ingeniosa confirmatione. </p>
