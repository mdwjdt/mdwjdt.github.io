609. 天堂, 随之人类心智被分成的这三个等级, 在某种程度上可通过尘世物质的对比来说明。 这三个等级就象区分金, 银, 铜的贵重等级, 它们好比尼布甲尼撒雕像上的那几种金属 (<a href="3927/daniel_2_31.htm">但以理2:31-35</a>)。 这三个等级彼此有别, 好比红宝石, 蓝宝石和玛瑙在纯度和品质上的区别, 也好比橄榄树, 葡萄树和无花果树的区别, 等等。 此外, 在圣言中, “金”, “红宝石”, “橄榄树”代表属天的良善, 这善属最高天堂; “银”, “蓝宝石”, “葡萄树”代表属灵的良善, 这善属中间天堂; 而“铜”, “玛瑙”, “无花果树”则代表属世的良善, 这善属最低天堂。 以上说明了, 存在三个等级, 即属天, 属灵, 属世。 </p>

609. The three levels on which the heavens exist, and therefore on which the human mind exists, can to some extent be illustrated by physical things in our world. The three levels are like the relative differences in value between gold, silver, and copper. (The statue of Nebuchadnezzar, <a href="3927/daniel_2_31.htm">Daniel 2:31</a> and following, is another analogy that uses these metals.) These three levels are as different from each other as a ruby, a sapphire, and an agate are different in purity and value. An olive tree, a grapevine, and a fig tree would be another set of examples; and so on. In fact, in the Word, gold, a ruby, and an olive tree symbolize goodness that is heavenly, the type of goodness found in the highest heaven; silver, a sapphire, and a grapevine symbolize goodness that is spiritual, the type of goodness found in the middle heaven; and copper, an agate, and a fig tree symbolize goodness that is earthly, the type of goodness found in the lowest heaven. (I have shown above that the three levels are the heavenly, the spiritual, and the earthly.) </p>

609. The three degrees into which the heavens, and consequently the human mind, are divided, can to some extent be illustrated by comparisons with materials in this world. The three degrees are like the degrees of nobility which distinguish gold, silver and copper; and there is a comparison drawn between them in the description of Nebuchadnezzar's statue (<a href="3927/daniel_2_31.htm">Daniel 2:31</a>ff). The three degrees are distinguished as ruby, sapphire and agate are in purity and quality; and as the olive-tree, the vine and the fig-tree, and so on. In the Word too gold, ruby and the olive stand for celestial good, the good of the highest heaven; silver, sapphire and the vine for spiritual good, the good of the middle heaven; and copper, agate and the fig-tree for natural good, the good of the lowest heaven. I said before that there are three degrees, celestial, spiritual and natural. </p>

609. The three degrees in which the heavens are, and consequently, in which the human mind is, may also be illustrated in some measure by comparisons with material things in the world. In their relative nobility these three degrees are like gold, silver, and brass, to which metals they are likened in the statue of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="3927/daniel_2_31.htm">Daniel 2:31-35</a>). These three degrees are also distinct from each other, like the ruby, sapphire, and agate in respect to purity and goodness; also like the olive tree, the vine, and the fig-tree; and so on. Moreover, in the Word, "gold," "ruby," and "oil" signify celestial good, which is the good of the highest heaven; "silver," "sapphire," and "a vine" signify spiritual good, which is that of the middle heaven; while "brass," "agate," and "a fig-tree" signify natural good, which is that of the lowest heaven. That there are three degrees, a celestial, a spiritual, and a natural, has been stated above. </p>

609. The three degrees which exist in heaven, and consequently in the human mind, may be illustrated in some measure by comparison with material things in the world. In relative excellence they are like gold, silver and copper, with which metals a comparison is made in the image seen by Nebuchadnezzar, <a href="3927/daniel_2_31.htm">Daniel 2:31</a> and following verses. These three degrees also are distinct from one another as the ruby, the sapphire and the agate are in relative purity and goodness; and also as the olive-tree, the vine and the fig-tree; and so on. For in the Word gold, the ruby and the olive-tree signify celestial good which is the good of the highest heaven; silver, the sapphire and the vine signify spiritual good, which is the good of the middle heaven; and copper, the agate and the fig-tree signify natural good, which is the good of the lowest heaven. That there are three degrees, the celestial, the spiritual and the natural, was stated above. </p>

609. Tres illi gradus in quibus Coeli sunt, consequenter in quibus Mens humana, possunt <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
etiam aliquatenus illustrari per comparationes cum materialibus in Mundo; illi tres gradus sunt sicut nobilitate inter se sunt Aurum, Argentum et Cuprum, cum quibus Metallis etiam <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
fit comparatio in Statua Nebuchadnezaris, <a href="3927/daniel_2_31.htm">Daniel 2:31</a>, seq. Tres illi gradus etiam inter se distincti sunt, sicut inter se puritate et bonitate, Rubinus, Sapphirus et Achates: et quoque sicut Olea, Vitis et Ficus, et sic porro; etiam Aurum, Rubinus et Olea in Verbo significant bonum coeleste, quod est bonum supremi coeli, et Argentum, Sapphirus et Vitis significant bonum spirituale, quod est bonum medii Coeli; et Cuprum, <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
Achates et Ficus bonum naturale, quod est bonum ultimi Coeli; quod sint tres gradus, coelestis, spiritualis, et naturalis, supra dictum est.<p>
