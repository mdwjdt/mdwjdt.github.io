<p>
605. People who have been regenerated, that is, people who have been made anew in will and intellect, are in the heat of heaven; that is, they have the love that heaven has. They are also in the light of heaven; that is, they have the wisdom heaven has. On the other hand, people who have not been regenerated are in the heat of hell; that is, they have the love that hell has. They are also in the darkness of hell; that is, they have the insanities that hell has.
<p>Nowadays this is well known, yet in other ways it is not known, because the church as it exists today has made regeneration an appendage to its faith. It says that reasoning should not be applied to the subject of faith, and should therefore not be applied to anything that is an appendage to faith, namely, regeneration and renewal.
<p>To people [in the church today], regeneration and renewal, along with that faith itself, are like a house whose doors and windows have been boarded up. No one knows who or what is inside the house. It may be empty; it might be full of demons from hell, or angels from heaven.
<p>In addition, confusion has been caused by a misunderstanding of the fact that we can rise up with our intellect almost into the light of heaven and therefore think and speak intelligently about spiritual matters, no matter what the love in our will is like. Not knowing the truth of this situation has led to complete ignorance about what it is to be regenerated and made new. </p>

605. A regenerate person, that is, one who is renewed in will and understanding, enjoys the heat of heaven, which is its love, together with the light of heaven, which is its wisdom, while in the contrary case one who is not regenerate experiences the heat of hell which is its love, together with the darkness of hell which is its madness; this is a fact which at the present time is known but still ignored. The reason is that the church as it exists at the present time has made regeneration an adjunct to its faith, and faith something which must not be subjected to reason, and consequently the same applies to anything belonging to its adjunct; and, as I said before, this includes regeneration and renewal. For them these, together with faith itself, are like a house with its doors and windows shut, so that no one knows what is in the house, whether it is merely empty or full of genii from hell or of angels from heaven. A second reason is that confusion has been introduced by the fallacy that a person can by his understanding climb almost into the light of heaven, and use his resulting intelligence to think and talk about spiritual matters, irrespective of what the love of his will is like. Ignorance of the truth about this has also prevented everything to do with regeneration and renewal being known. </p>

605. That the regenerate man, that is, one who is renewed in will and understanding, is in the heat of heaven, that is, in its love, and at the same time in the light of heaven, that is, in its wisdom; and on the other hand, that the unregenerate man is in the heat of hell, that is, in its love, and at the same time in its darkness, that is, in its insanities, is at this day known and yet unknown. This is because the church of today makes regeneration an appendage to its faith, and into faith reason must not be admitted, consequently it must be admitted into nothing pertaining to its appendage, which, as before said, includes renovation and regeneration. These, together with that faith itself, are to those of the present church like a house, the doors and windows of which are closed, so that it is not known what is in it, whether it is empty or is full of genii from hell, or of angels from heaven. It may be added, that this confusion has been brought about by a fallacy which has arisen from the fact that a man may by his understanding ascend almost into the light of heaven, and consequently can from intelligence think and speak of spiritual things, whatever his will's love may be. Ignorance of this truth has also caused ignorance of all that concerns regeneration and renovation of character. </p>

<p>
605. At this day it is known, and yet not known, that the regenerate man, that is, the man renewed as to his will and understanding, is in the heat and at the same time in the light of heaven, that is, in its love and in its wisdom; and, on the contrary, that the unregenerate man is in the heat and at the same time in the darkness of hell, that is, in its love and in its madness. This is because the present Church has made regeneration an appendage to its faith, into which reason must not enter; consequently reason must not enter into regeneration and renovation, which constitute an appendage to faith. These three then, regeneration, renovation and faith are to the present Church like a house whose doors and windows are closed, so that it is not known what is within, whether it is empty, or full of spirits from hell or of angels from heaven. It may be added that this confusion has arisen from a misinterpretation of the fact that a man can ascend with the understanding almost into the light of heaven, and thence think and speak intelligently on spiritual subjects, whatever the love of his will may be. Ignorance upon this truth has been the cause of ignorance of all that concerns regeneration and renovation. </p>

605. Quod homo regeneratus, hoc est, quoad voluntatem et intellectum renovatus, sit in calore Coeli, hoc est, in amore ejus, et simul in luce Coeli, hoc est, in sapientia ejus, et vicissim, quod homo non regeneratus sit in calore inferni, hoc est, in amore ejus, et simul in tenebris inferni, hoc est, in insaniis ejus, est hodie notum et usque ignotum; causa est, quia Ecclesia, quae hodie est, regenerationem fecit appendicem fidei suae, in quam non aliqua ratio immittenda est, consequenter nec in aliquid quod est appendicis ejus, quod, ut dictum, est regeneratio et renovatio; hae cum ipsa fide sunt illis sicut domus, cujus januae et fenestrae clausae sunt, quare nescitur quid intus in domo illa est, Numeri modo vacuum, vel num plenum geniis ab inferno aut angelis e Coelo. Accedit, quod fallacia hoc confuderit, quae est, quod quia homo intellectu ascendere potest, paene in lucem Coeli, et inde ex intelligentia cogitare et loqui de spiritualibus, qualiscunque Amor voluntatis ejus sit; ex hujus veritatis ignorantia etiam ignotum factum est omne quod regenerationem et renovationem concernit. </p>
