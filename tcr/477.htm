477. 人被保守在这个空间中, 一直处于中间地带, 唯一目的在于, 他可以在属灵事物上拥有选择自由, 这就是属灵的平衡, 因为它是天堂与地狱之间的平衡, 因而也是善与恶之间的平衡。 所有身处这巨大空间者, 就其内在而言, 要么与天堂天人结合, 要么与地狱魔鬼结合; 然而如今, 要么与米迦勒的使者结合, 要么与龙的使者结合。 死后, 每个人都自行奔往该空间里的同类人那里, 与情投意合者相联, 因为爱将那里的每个人和他的同类结合起来, 使他自由释放自己的灵魂, 延续他以前的生活状态。 但那时, 未与其内在合为一体的外在会逐渐被脱去, 当这个过程完成后, 善人被提升天堂, 恶人则自己奔向地狱, 各自照着自己的主导爱, 归向自己的同类。 </p>

<p>
477. We are kept in this great interspace and are constantly held in the center of it for one reason only: to grant us free choice in spiritual matters. The equilibrium in question is spiritual, because it is an equilibrium between heaven and hell, and therefore between good and evil. All the people who are in that great interspace are inwardly in partnership either with angels in heaven or with devils in hell. (Today that partnership is either with Michael's angels or with the dragon's angels.) All people after death travel toward their own kind in that interspace and associate with people who love similar things. This happens because love connects all individuals there with others like themselves and allows them to breathe freely and to be in the state of life they were in before. Then step by step they shed outer traits that are not in harmony with what is inside them. Once that process is complete, good people are lifted into heaven and evil people move to hell. In either case they gravitate toward people with the same dominant love as their own. </p>

477. A person's being kept in this great gap, and constantly in the middle of it, is solely for the purpose of giving him free will in spiritual matters. For this is spiritual equilibrium, since it is between heaven and hell, and so between good and evil. All who are in that great gap are linked as regards their interiors either with the angels of heaven or with the devils of hell; at the present time however, with Michael's angels or the dragon's angels. Everyone after death betakes himself to his own people in that gap, and associates with those with a love similar to his. For it is love that links each person there to people like him, and makes him breathe freely and resume his state during his previous life. But then by stages the externals which do not make one with the internals are shed, and when this is done the good person is raised to heaven, and the wicked person takes himself to hell, each going to people like himself, with whom he makes one in respect of his ruling love. </p>

477. Man is kept in this great interspace, and midway therein continually, for the sole purpose that he may have freedom of choice in spiritual things, for this is a spiritual equilibrium, because it is an equilibrium between heaven and hell, thus between good and evil. All who are in that great interspace are, as to their interiors, conjoined either with the angels of heaven or with the devils of hell; or at the present day either with the angels of Michael or with the angels of the dragon. After death every man betakes himself to his own in that interspace and associates himself with those who are in a love similar to his own, for love conjoins everyone there with his like, and causes him to breathe out his soul freely, and to continue in his previous state of life. But the externals that do not make one with his internals are then gradually put off, and when this has been done the good man is raised up to heaven, and the evil man betakes himself to hell, each to such as he is at one with as to his ruling love. </p>

477. The sole reason why man is kept in this great intervening region and remains continually in the midst of it is that he may enjoy free will in spiritual things; for this is spiritual equilibrium, because it is between heaven and hell, and thus between good and evil. All who are in this great region are, as to their interiors, associated either with angels of heaven or with devils of hell; but at this day with the angels of Michael <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
or with those of the dragon. After death every man betakes himself to his own in that region, and associates with those whose love is similar to his own; for love unites every one there with those like him, and enables him to breathe freely and to continue in the state of his former life. Gradually, however, the spirit is divested of externals which do not accord with its internals; and when this is done, the good are taken up into heaven, and the evil betake themselves to hell, each to the company of those with whom he is united as to his ruling love.<p>

477. Quod homo teneatur in hoc magno Interstitio, et ibi continue in ejus medio, est unice propter causam, ut in libero arbitrio in spiritualibus sit, nam aequilibrium hoc est aequilibrium spirituale, quia est inter Coelum et Infernum, ita inter bonum et malum. Omnes, qui in magno illo Interstitio sunt, quoad interiora sua, conjuncti sunt vel cum Angelis coeli, vel cum diabolis inferni, at hodie vel cum Angelis Michaelis, vel cum Angelis draconis. Omnis homo post mortem ad suos in illo Interstitio se confert, et adsociat se illis, qui in simili amore sunt, nam Amor conjungit unumquemvis ibi cum similibus, et facit ut libere respiret animam, ac sit in statu vitae anteactae; at successive tunc exuuntur externa, quae non unum faciunt cum internis; quo facto bonus elevatur in Coelum, et malus se confert in infernum, quisque ad tales, cum quibus quoad amorem regnantem unum facit. </p>
