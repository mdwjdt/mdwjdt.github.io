580. The reason why the heading asserts that we are capable of being regenerated in a way that suits the state we are in is that the uneducated, for example, are regenerated in a different way than the educated. People with different interests are regenerated in different ways. People who are in different lines of work are regenerated in different ways. People who study the outer meanings of the Word are regenerated in a different way than those who study its inner meanings. Those who inherited an earthly goodness from their parents are regenerated in a different way than those who inherited evil from their parents. People who have become heavily involved from an early age in the pointless pursuits of this world are regenerated in a different way than people who have discontinued those activities, whether they stopped them sooner or later in their lives. Briefly put, people who constitute the Lord's outer church are regenerated in a different way than people who constitute his inner church. The variety is in fact infinite, just like the variety of faces and minds. Despite the variety, however, absolutely all of us are capable of being regenerated and saved in a way that suits the state we are in.
</p>
<p>
[2] The truth of this can be seen by considering the heavens, and the fact that all people who have been regenerated go there. There are three heavens: the highest, the middle, and the lowest. If we receive love for the Lord as a result of our regeneration, we come into the highest heaven. If we receive love for our neighbor, we come into the middle heaven. If we practice only an outer goodwill and acknowledge the Lord as God the Redeemer and Savior, we come into the lowest heaven. All such people are saved, but in different ways.
</p>
<p>
[3] The reason why all are capable of being regenerated and saved is that the Lord is present with, and brings his divine goodness and truth to, every human being. This is the source of everyone's life and everyone's faculty of understanding and will and also everyone's free choice in spiritual matters. No human being is lacking these attributes. Everyone has also been given means that teach commandments concerning good and evil and the idea that there is a God. Christians find these teachings in the Word; non-Christians find them in whichever religion they are in.
<p>From this it follows that everyone is capable of being saved. It is our own fault, not the Lord's fault, if we are not saved. It is our fault because we have not cooperated. </p>

580. The reason why everyone can be regenerated depending on his state, is that the process is different with the simple and the learned, with those who have different pursuits, and undertake different duties; with those who research into the externals of the Word and those who research into its internals; with those whose parentage has brought them into natural good and those who have been brought into evil; with those who from childhood have plunged into the world's vanities, and those who have sooner or later distanced themselves from them. In short, there is a difference between those who make up the Lord's external church and those who make up the internal one. In this there is infinite variety, just as there is in faces and characters. But still each can be regenerated and saved depending on his state.</p>
<p>
[2] The truth of this can be established from the heavens, to which all who are regenerated come, being three, highest, middle and lowest. Those come to the highest who through regeneration have acquired love to the Lord; to the middle one those who have acquired love towards the neighbour; to the lowest those who only exhibit external charity, and at the same time acknowledge the Lord as God the Redeemer and Saviour. All of these are saved, but in different ways.</p>
<p>
[3] The reason why all can be regenerated and so saved is that the Lord is present with His Divine good and truth with every person. This is the source of his life, and of his ability to understand and will, and of the free will he has in spiritual matters; no one is without these. Moreover the means are given. Christians have the means in the Word, non-Christians in any religion at all, if it teaches the existence of God and commandments about good and evil. From this it follows that everyone can be saved. Consequently, if a person is not saved, it is not the Lord who is to blame but the person; and he is to blame for failing to co-operate. </p>

<p>
580. Every man may be regenerated, each according to his state; for the simple and the learned are regenerated differently; as are those engaged in different pursuits, and those who fill different offices; those who search into the external things of the Word, and those who search into its internals; those who are principled in natural good from their parents, and those who are in evil; those who from their infancy have entered into the vanities of the world, and those who sooner or later have withdrawn from them; in a word, those who constitute the Lord's external church are regenerated differently from those who constitute His internal church, and this variety, like that of men's features and dispositions, is infinite; and yet everyone, according to his state, may be regenerated and saved.
</p>
<p>
[2] The truth of this can be seen in the heavens, to which all the regenerate go, in that there are three heavens, a highest, a middle, and a lowest; and those who by regeneration acquire love to the Lord enter the highest heaven, those who acquire love to the neighbor, enter the middle heaven, and those who merely practice external charity, but at the same time acknowledge the Lord as God the Redeemer and Savior, enter the lowest heaven. All these are saved but in different ways.
</p>
<p>
[3] All may be regenerated and thus saved, because the Lord with His Divine good and truth is present with every man; this is the source of everyone's life and his ability to understand and will, together with freedom of choice in spiritual things; in no man are these lacking. And the means to these are also given, for Christians in the Word, and for Gentiles in their religions, which teach that there is a God, and which furnish precepts respecting good and evil. From all this it follows that everyone may be saved; consequently that it is not the Lord's fault if man is not saved, but man's, because he does not co-operate. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #580 (Dick, 1950)
</h4>
<p>
580. Every one can be regenerated according to his state; for the process varies with the simple and the learned, and with those of different pursuits and employments. It varies with those who study the external content of the Word and those who study its internal content; and with those who are in natural good derived from their parents and those who are in natural evil. It varies also with those who from their infancy have plunged themselves into the vanities of the world and those who have sooner or later withdrawn themselves from them. In a word, it varies with those who constitute the Lord's external Church and those who constitute His internal Church. The variety is infinite, like that of men's faces and disposition; nevertheless every one can be regenerated and saved according to his state.</p>
<p>
[2] That this is the case may be evident from the composition of the heavens, into which all the regenerate go. These are three in number, the highest, the middle and the lowest. To the highest those go who by regeneration receive love to the Lord; to the middle, those who have love towards the neighbor; and to the lowest, those who only practice external charity, and at the same time acknowledge the Lord as God, the Redeemer and Savior. All these are saved, but in different ways.</p>
<p>
[3] All can be regenerated and thus saved because the Lord with His Divine Good and Truth is present with every man. From this presence every one has life, and hence the faculty of understanding and the faculty of willing, and to these is added free will in spiritual things. These gifts are wanting in no man; and means for their use are also provided; for Christians these are to be found in the Word, and for Gentiles in the religion of any one which teaches that there is a God, and sets forth precepts respecting good and evil. From all this it follows that every one can be saved; consequently if a man is not saved, the fault is not the Lord's but man's, because he fails to co-operate with the Lord. </p>

580. Quod quisque secundum suum statum regenerari possit, est quia aliter simplices quam docti, aliter qui in diversis studiis sunt, et quoque in diversis officiis, aliter qui in scrutiniis de Verbi externis, et de ejus internis, aliter qui a parentibus in bono naturali sunt, quam qui in malo, aliter qui ab infantia in Mundi vanitates se intulerunt, et aliter qui citius aut serius <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
ab illis se removerunt; verbo, aliter qui externam Domini Ecclesiam constituunt, et aliter qui internam; est haec varietas infinita, sicut est facierum et animorum; sed usque unusquisque secundum suum statum regenerari et salvari potest.</p>
<p>
[2] Quod ita sit, constare potest ex Coelis, in quos omnes regenerati veniunt, quod sint tres, Supremus, Medius, et Ultimus, et in Supremum veniunt illi, qui per regenerationem recipiunt amorem in Dominum, in Medium qui amorem erga proximum, in Ultimum, qui modo operantur Charitatem externam, et simul agnoscunt Dominum pro Deo Redemptore et Salvatore. Omnes hi salvati sunt, sed diversimode.</p>
<p>
[3] Quod omnes possint regenerari et sic salvari, est quia Dominus cum Divino suo Bono et Vero est praesens apud omnem hominem, inde est vita cujusvis, et inde est facultas intelligendi et volendi, et his Liberum <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
arbitrium in spiritualibus; haec nulli homini desunt; et quoque data sunt media, Christianis in Verbo, et Gentilibus in cujusvis religione, quae docet quod Deus sit, et praecepta de bono et malo. Ex his sequitur hoc, quod quisque possit salvari; consequenter quod Dominus non in culpa sit, sed homo si non salvatur, et homo in culpa, quod non cooperetur.<p>
