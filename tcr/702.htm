702. When We Know Correspondences, We Realize What "the Lord's Flesh" and "the Lord's Blood" Mean; We See That They Mean the Same Thing as "Bread" and "Wine" Do. That Is, "the Lord's Flesh" and "Bread" Mean the Divine Goodness That Comes from His Love and Also All the Goodness Related to Goodwill, and "the Lord's Blood" and "Wine" Mean the Divine Truth That Comes from His Wisdom and Also All the Truth Related to Faith; "Eating" Them Means Making Them Our Own
<p>Because the spiritual meaning of the Word has been disclosed today, and correspondences have been disclosed as well, since they are what convey that meaning, all that is required here is to quote passages from the Word that allow us to see clearly what "flesh" and "blood" and the bread and the wine in the Holy Supper mean. First, however, I will present passages that show how this sacrament was originally instituted by the Lord, and passages in which the Lord himself teaches about his flesh and blood and about bread and wine. </p>

702. II. A knowledge of correspondences allows us to know what is meant by the Lord's flesh and blood, much the same as by bread and wine. This is that the Lord's flesh and the bread mean the Divine good of His love and also all the good of charity; and the Lord's blood and the wine mean the Divine truth of His wisdom and also all the truth of faith. Eating means making one's own.<p>Since at the present time the spiritual sense of the Word has 'been disclosed, and together with it the correspondences, since the correspondences are the means it employs, it will only be necessary to quote the passages in the Word which enable it to be clearly seen what is the meaning of flesh and blood, and of bread and wine, in the Holy Supper. But I shall preface these with a description of the institution of that sacrament by the Lord, and also with His teaching about His flesh and blood, and about bread and wine. </p>

702. II. WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF CORRESPONDENCES WHAT IS MEANT BY THE LORD'S FLESH AND BLOOD CAN BE KNOWN, ALSO THAT BREAD AND WINE HAVE A LIKE MEANING, NAMELY, THAT THE LORD'S FLESH AND THE BREAD MEAN THE DIVINE GOOD OF HIS LOVE, ALSO ALL GOOD OF CHARITY: AND THE LORD'S BLOOD AND THE WINE MEAN THE DIVINE TRUTH OF HIS WISDOM, ALSO ALL TRUTH OF FAITH; AND EATING MEANS APPROPRIATION. <p>As the spiritual sense of the Word has at this day been disclosed, and together with it correspondences (because they mediate between the two senses) I will merely present some passages from the Word, from which it can be clearly seen what is meant by the flesh and the blood, as also by the bread and the wine in the holy supper. But before this the institution itself of this sacrament by the Lord, and His doctrine concerning His flesh and blood, and the bread and the wine, shall be set forth. </p>

702. II. FROM A KNOWLEDGE OF CORRESPONDENCES IT MAY BE KNOWN WHAT IS MEANT BY THE FLESH AND BLOOD OF THE LORD, AND THAT THE SAME IS MEANT BY THE BREAD AND WINE; NAMELY, THAT BY THE FLESH OF THE LORD, AND BY THE BREAD, IS MEANT THE DIVINE GOOD OF HIS LOVE, AND ALSO ALL THE GOOD OF CHARITY; AND THAT BY THE BLOOD OF THE LORD, AND BY WINE, IS MEANT THE DIVINE TRUTH OF HIS WISDOM, AND ALSO ALL THE TRUTH OF FAITH; AND THAT BY EATING IS MEANT APPROPRIATION.
<p>Since the spiritual sense of the Word has been disclosed at this day, and together with it, correspondences, as these are mediatory between the two senses, therefore it is only necessary to quote passages from the Word from which it may be clearly seen what is meant by flesh and blood, and also by bread and wine in the Holy Supper. But these shall be preceded by an account of the institution of that sacrament by the Lord, and also by His doctrine concerning His flesh and blood, and concerning the bread and wine. </p>

702. Quod ex notis Correspondentiis sciatur, quid per Carnem et Sanguinem Domini intelligitur, et quod simile per Panem et Vinum, videlicet, quod per Carnem Domini et per Panem intelligatur Divinum Bonum Amoris Ipsius et quoque omne Bonum charitatis, et quod per Sanguinem Domini et per Vinum, Divinum Verum Sapientiae Ipsius, et quoque omne verum Fidei, et per Manducationem appropriatio.<p>Quoniam hodie Sensus spiritualis Verbi detectus est, et simul cum illo Correspondentiae, quia hae mediant, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
ideo solum adducentur loca e Verbo, ex quibus clare videri potest, quid per Carnem et Sanguinem, et per Panem et Vinum, in Sancta Coena intelligitur; sed illis praemittetur ipsa Institutio Sacramenti istius a Domino; et quoque Doctrina Ipsius de sua Carne et suo Sanguine, deque Pane et Vino.<p>
