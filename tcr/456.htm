<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">爱主与爱邻的结合</h4><br />456.众所周知，西奈山上所颁布的律法被写在两块石版上，其中一块关系到神，另一块关系到人；这两块石版在摩西手中是一块，其中关于神的内容在右边，关于人的内容在左边。因此，当它呈现在世人眼前时，两边的内容就会一起被看到。所以，一边能为另一边所见，就象耶和华与摩西交谈，摩西与耶和华面对面，如我们所读到的那样。这样做是为了使如此联结的两块石版能代表神与人的结合，以及人与神的相互结合。为此，如此写就的律法被称为圣约和见证。圣约表示结合，见证表示照着约定生活。如此联结的这两块石版使我们得以看到爱神与爱邻的结合。第一块石版包含与爱神相关的所有事物，这些事物居于主导地位：人当承认一位神，承认其人身的神性，圣言的神圣，要用从神发出的神圣事物来敬拜祂。这块石版包含这些事物，这一点从对十诫的解读（第五章）明显可知。第二块石版包含与爱邻相关的所有事物，它的头五条诫命涉及与被称为“工”的行为相关的所有事物，后两条诫命则涉及与意愿、因而与仁爱起源相关的所有事物。因为后两条诫命说“你不可贪恋”，当人不贪恋邻人的一切时，他就会希望邻人好。十诫既包含与爱神相关的所有事物，也包含与爱邻相关的所有事物，对此，参看329－331节；那里还说明，只有那些拥有仁爱之人才有这两块石版的结合。</p>

456. 愛上帝與愛鄰舍的關係
<p>眾所周知, 從西乃山上頒佈的律法被寫在兩塊石版之上, 其中一塊是關於上帝的, 另一塊關於人。人們還知道, 在摩西手裡, 這兩塊其實是一塊石版:關於上帝的書寫內容在右邊, 關於人的內容寫在左邊。因此, 當呈現在人的眼前時, 能同時看到兩邊的內容。因此, 一邊與另一邊面對著, 如同耶和華與摩西,摩西與耶和華面對面說話; 正如我們所讀到的(<a href="3927/exodus_33_11.htm">出埃及記33:11</a>;<a href="3927/deuteronomy_34_10.htm">申命記34:10</a>)。
<p>兩塊石版以這樣的方式相連, 代表著上帝與人,人與上帝互動關係。為此, 在上面所寫的律法被稱為"約"和"見證"。"約"表示契約的關係, "見證"表示遵守契約的生活。
<p>兩塊石版的聯合展現了愛上帝與愛鄰舍之間的關係。第一塊石版涉及了愛上帝的方方面面。這些內容佔據了首要的位置:我們當承認一位上帝,承認祂所取人身之神性,承認聖言之神聖, 並藉著從祂而來的神聖來敬拜祂。在第五章關於十誡的內容(<a href="291.htm">291-308</a>節)中可清楚得知這是第一塊石版的主題。
<p>第二塊石版涉及了愛鄰舍的方方面面。其中前五條誡命是關於我們的行為, 或者稱我們當作的"工"。另兩條誡命(第九,十誡)則關於我們的意志以及關於意志的起源, 告訴我們"不可貪心"; 當一個人不貪其鄰舍所擁有的, 他便是祝願鄰舍好。
<p>十誡包含了愛上帝與愛鄰舍的一切內容(請參看之前的<a href="329.htm">329-331</a>節)。在那裡還討論了在有義之人的心裡, 兩塊石版是連貫的。 </p>

456. The Connection between Loving God and Loving Our Neighbor
<p>People generally know that the law proclaimed on Mount Sinai was written on two tablets, one of which was about God and the other about humankind. People also know that in Moses' hand the two were a single tablet: the right-hand side contained writing concerning God, and the left-hand side contained writing concerning humankind, because if it was set before people's eyes in this way, the writing on both sides would be seen at once. Therefore the sides faced one another like Jehovah talking with Moses and Moses with Jehovah, face to face, as we read [<a href="3927/exodus_33_11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_34_10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>].
<p>The tablets were made in this way so that together they would represent God's connection to people and people's reciprocal connection to God. For this reason the law written there was called "the Covenant" and "the Testimony. " The term "covenant" refers to the partnership and "testimony" refers to the life that follows the points agreed upon.
<p>The union of the two tablets shows the connection between loving God and loving our neighbor. The first tablet covers all aspects of loving God; they are primarily that we should acknowledge one God, the divinity of his human manifestation, and the holiness of the Word; and that in worshiping him we are to use the holy things that come from him. (The fact that the first tablet covers the above is clear from the comments made in chapter 5 on the Ten Commandments [291-308].)
<p>The second tablet covers all aspects of loving our neighbor. The first five of its commandments relate to our behavior, or what are called our "works. " Its other two commandments relate to our will and to the origins of goodwill: they tell us that we should not covet what our neighbors have, and that by not doing so, we have their well-being in mind.
<p>On the point that the Ten Commandments contain everything about how to love God and how to love our neighbor, see 329, 330, and 331 above. That discussion also shows that in people who have goodwill the two tablets are connected. </p>

456. XVIII. The linking of love to God and love towards the neighbour.<p>It is well known that the law delivered from Mount Sinai was written on two tablets, one of them relating to God, the other to men; and that these were in Moses' hand a single tablet, with the writing about God on the right side and that about men on the left. <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
Thus when it was presented to human eyes, the writing on both sides would be seen together; so one part would be visible to the other, like Jehovah talking with Moses, and Moses with Jehovah face to face, as we read. This was done so that the tablets thus joined should represent the linking of God with men, and reciprocally that of men with God. This was the reason why the law so written was called a covenant and a witness; a covenant means linking, and witness means living in accordance with agreements.</p>
<p>
[2] These two tablets so joined allow us to see the linking of love to God and love towards the neighbour. The first tablet is concerned with everything to do with love to God, and these occupy the leading position: we should acknowledge one God, the divinity of His Human, and the holiness of the Word, and God is to be worshipped by means of the holy things coming from Him. It is clear that this is the subject of this tablet from the remarks made in Chapter 5 about the Ten Commandments. The second tablet is concerned with everything to do with love towards the neighbour; its first five commandments deal with actions and are called deeds, and the last two with matters of the will, so what is to do with charity in its origin. In these last it says, 'You are not to covet,' and when a person does not covet what is his neighbour's, then he wishes him well. The Ten Commandments contain everything to do with love to God and everything to do with love towards the neighbour; <a href="329.htm">329-331</a> above. It was also shown there that the linking of the two tablets takes place with those who possess charity.<p>

456. XVIII. THE CONJUNCTION OF LOVE TO GOD AND LOVE TOWARDS THE NEIGHBOR <p>It is known that the Law promulgated from Mount Sinai was written upon two tables, one of which related to God and the other to men; that in the hands of Moses they were one table, the writing on the right side of which related to God, and that on the left to men; and that when so presented to the eyes of men the writing on both sides was seen at the same time, thus one side was in view of the other, like Jehovah talking to Moses and Moses to Jehovah, face to face, as it is written. This was done in order that the tables so united might represent the conjunction of God with men, and the reciprocal conjunction of men with God; and this is why the written law was called a Covenant and a Testimony, "covenant" signifying conjunction, and "testimony" life according to the compact. These two tables so united exhibit the conjunction of love to God with love towards the neighbor. The first table includes all things pertaining to love to God, which are, primarily, that man should acknowledge the one God, the Divinity of His Human, and the holiness of the Word, and that God is to be worshiped through the holy things that proceed from Him. That this table includes these things is evident from the explanation, in chapter five, of the commandments of the Decalogue. The second table includes all things pertaining to love towards the neighbor, its first five commandments all things pertaining to action, which are called works, and the last two all things pertaining to the will, thus to charity in its origin; for in these it is said, "Thou shalt not covet," and when man does not covet what belongs to his neighbor, he wishes well to him. That the ten commandments of the Decalogue contain all things pertaining to love to God and all things pertaining to love towards the neighbor, may be seen above (<a href="329.htm">329-331</a>); where it is also shown that there is a conjunction of the two tables in those who are in charity. </p>

456. XVIII. THE CONJUNCTION OF LOVE TO GOD AND LOVE TOWARDS THE NEIGHBOR.<p>As is well known, the Law promulgated from Mount Sinai was written on two tables, one of which treats of God and the other of men. In the hand of Moses they were one table, on the right side of which was written what relates to God, and on the left what relates to men; so that when presented for men to read, the writing on both tables was seen at the same time. Thus one part was in view of the other, like Jehovah speaking with Moses and Moses with Jehovah, face to face, as it is written. The tables were so united that they might represent the conjunction of God with men, and the reciprocal conjunction of men with God. Hence the Law written on them was called the Covenant and the Testimony; for a covenant signifies conjunction, and testimony a life according to the terms of the covenant.<p>This union of the two tables exemplifies the conjunction of love to God and love towards the neighbor. The first table includes all things relating to love to God. These are, primarily, that man ought to acknowledge one God, the Divinity of His Human, and the holiness of the Word; and that He is to be worshipped by means of the holy things which proceed from Him. That these are the contents of the first table appears from what has been said in Chapter V regarding the precepts of the Decalogue. The second table includes all things relating to love towards the neighbor. Its first five commandments include those things which relate to action, and which are called works; and the last two include those things which relate to the will, and thus to charity at its source; for in these two commandments it is said: "Thou shalt not covet," and when a man does not covet what belongs to the neighbor, he then bears good will towards him. That the ten commandments of the Decalogue contain all things respecting love to God and love towards the neighbor, may be seen above in Nos. <a href="329.htm">329-331</a>, where it is also shown that there is a conjunction of both tables with those who are in charity. </p>

456. De Conjunctione amoris in Deum, et amoris erga proximum.<p>Notum est, quod Lex e Monte Sinai promulgata, inscripta sit binis Tabulis, et quod una harum sit de Deo, et altera de Hominibus, et quod illae in manu Mosis una Tabula fuerint, a cujus Parte dextra fuit Scriptum de Deo, et a sinistra de hominibus, et quod sic oblata oculis hominum scriptura utriusque Partis simul conspiceretur, ita fuit una Pars in conspectu alterius, sicut Jehovae loquentis cum Mose et Mosis cum Jehovah facie ad faciem, ut legitur. Hoc ideo factum est, ut Tabulae sic unitae repraesentarent conjunctionem Dei cum hominibus, et reciprocam hominum cum Deo; propter quam causam Lex inscripta vocabatur FOEDUS ET TESTIMONIUM; Foedus significat conjunctionem, et Testimonium vitam secundum pacta.</p>
<p>
[2] Ex binis his Tabulis ita unitis videri potest conjunctio Amoris in Deum, et Amoris erga proximum; Prima Tabula involvit omnia quae Amoris in Deum sunt, quae primario sunt, quod oporteat agnoscere Unum Deum, Divinitatem Humani Ipsius, et Sanctitatem Verbi, et quod colendus sit per Sancta quae procedunt ab Ipso; quod haec Tabula involvat illa, constat ex illis, quae in Capite Vto super Decalogi Praecepta commentata sunt: Secunda Tabula involvit omnia illa quae Amoris erga proximum sunt; quinque priora ejus praecepta illa quae facti sunt, et vocantur Opera, et duo posteriora illa quae voluntatis sunt, ita illa quae Charitatis sunt in sua origine; in his enim dicitur non Concupisces, et cum homo non concupiscit illa quae proximi sunt, tunc bene illi vult; Quod Decem Praecepta Decalogi contineant omnia quae Amoris in Deum sunt, et omnia quae Amoris erga proximum sunt, videatur supra <a href="329.htm">329-331</a>. Ubi etiam ostensum est quod conjunctio utriusque Tabulae sit apud illos qui in Charitate sunt. </p>
