589. 必须知道, 将觉知几乎提升至天堂天人所享有的聪明才智的能力, 是每个人通过受造所固有的, 恶人, 善人都有, 甚至地狱的每个魔鬼也有, 因为所有在地狱者都曾是人。 我已通过大量活生生的经历清楚明白这一点。 但在属灵的事上, 地狱之人并不聪明, 反而很疯狂, 因为他们不意愿善, 而意愿恶, 结果他们厌恶认识和觉知真理, 因为真理支持良善, 反对邪恶。 这一切也清楚表明, 新生的第一步就是接受所觉知的真理, 第二步就是愿意照着真理行动, 最后践行真理。 尽管如此, 仅仅通过认识真理, 还称不上被改造, 因为凭借提升觉知至意之爱以上的能力, 人皆能认识真理, 也能谈论, 教导并传讲它们。 但只有由于真理的缘故而对真理拥有情感之人才能被改造, 因为这情感会和意愿结合起来, 若发展下去, 它还会将意愿联结于觉知, 然后重生就开始了。 下文将告知有关重生的后续推进和发展。 </p>

589. It is important to know that the capacity to lift the intellect even to a level of understanding possessed by the angels in heaven has been created as a part of every human being, the evil as well as the good. In fact every devil in hell retains this ability, since all those who are in hell existed as human beings [in the physical world]. I have often been shown through living experience that this is the case.
<p>Nonetheless, the reason the devils in hell are insane rather than intelligent in spiritual matters is that they will what is evil and not what is good. Knowing and understanding truths is repulsive to them, because truths favor what is good and oppose what is evil.
<p>These points also make it clear that the first step in our being generated anew is to receive truths in our intellect. The second step is to intend to put those truths into practice; eventually it takes the form of actually putting them into practice.
<p>No one can justifiably be called a "reformed" person solely on the basis of his or her knowledge of truth. By lifting our intellect above the love that resides in our will, we are all capable of grasping those truths, saying them, teaching them, and preaching them. A truly reformed person is someone who desires the truth because it is true. This desire attaches itself to our will, and if it persists, forges a partnership between our will and our intellect. Then our regeneration begins. (Later sections will deal with how our regeneration proceeds and is perfected after that.) </p>

589. It must be appreciated that the capacity for raising the understanding to the level of intelligence enjoyed by the angels of heaven is inherent in every person from creation, the wicked as well as the good; in fact even in every devil in hell, for all who are in hell were once people on earth. I have had this shown me by direct experience on numerous occasions. However, in spiritual matters devils are not intelligent but in the grip of madness, because they do not will good, but evil. As a result they loathe knowing and understanding truths, since these favour good and oppose evil. This too makes it clear that the first stage of re-birth is the reception of truths by the understanding, and its second stage is willing to act as truths direct and eventually doing these things. All the same, no one can be called reformed by only getting to know truths, since the capacity a person has for raising his understanding above the love of the will enables him to learn truths, and also to talk about them, teach them and preach them. A person is reformed if he has an affection for truth for truth's sake, for this affection links itself with the will, and if it continues, links the will with the understanding. That is when regeneration begins. The subsequent progress and development of regeneration will be described in the following pages. </p>

589. It must be known that the ability to elevate the understanding even to the intelligence in which the angels of heaven are, is by creation inherent in every man, the wicked as well as the good, and even in every devil in hell, for all who are in hell have been men. This has been frequently shown to me by living experience. But such are not intelligent but insane in spiritual things, because they do not will good but evil, consequently they are averse to knowing and understanding truths, for truths favor good and oppose evil. From all this it is clear that the first step in the new birth is a reception of truths by the understanding, and the second is the will to act in accordance with truths, and finally to practice them. No one, however, can be said to be reformed by mere knowledges of truth; for man is able to acquire these and to talk about, teach, and preach them through his ability to elevate his understanding, above the love of his will. But he is a reformed man who has an affection for truth for the sake of truth; for this affection conjoins itself with the will, and if it goes on it conjoins the will to the understanding, and then regeneration begins. But how regeneration afterward advances and is perfected, will be told in what follows. </p>

589. It should be known that the power of elevating the understanding even to the intelligence in which the angels of heaven are, is inherent by creation in every man, evil as well as good, indeed in every devil in hell; for all in hell were once men. This has often been shown to me by actual experience. Devils, however, are not intelligent but insane in regard to spiritual things because they do not will good but evil; and consequently they refuse to know and understand truths, because truths favor good and are opposed to evil. It is also evident from this that the first stage of the new birth is the reception of truths in the understanding; and the second is a willingness to act according to them and at length to practice them. No one, however, can be said to be reformed by the mere knowledge of truths; for a man, from the power of elevating his understanding above the love of his will, can apprehend truths, and also speak, teach and preach them; but that man is reformed who is in the affection of truth for truth's sake. For this affection conjoins itself with the will, and as it increases, it conjoins the will with the understanding, and then regeneration begins. How regeneration afterwards advances and is brought to perfection will be told in what follows. </p>

589. Sciendum est, quod facultas elevandi intellectum usque ad intelligentiam in qua sunt Angeli Coeli, a creatione cuivis homini insit, tam malo quam bono, imo etiam omni diabolo in inferno, nam omnes qui in inferno sunt fuerunt homines; hoc mihi per vivam experientiam saepius ostensum est; ast quod non sint in intelligentia, sed in insania in spiritualibus, est quia non volunt bonum sed malum, inde aversantur scire et intelligere vera, nam vera sunt pro bono, et contra malum. Ex his etiam patet, quod Primum novae generationis sit receptio veritatum intellectu, et quod Secundum ejus sit, quod velit facere secundum veritates, et tandem facere illas. Verum enim vero non potest aliquis dici reformatus per solas cognitiones veritatum, nam homo ex facultate elevandi intellectum supra amorem voluntatis potest apprehendere illas, et quoque loqui, docere et praedicare illas; sed ille Reformatus est, qui in affectione veritatis est propter veritatem, nam haec affectio conjungit se cum voluntate, et si pergit, conjungit voluntatem intellectui; et tunc incipit Regeneratio: quomodo autem Regeneratio postea progreditur et perficitur, in sequentibus dicetur. </p>
