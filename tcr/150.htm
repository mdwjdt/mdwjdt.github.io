<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第150节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>150</b>.那些信主耶稣基督的人就会接受这些属灵的恩惠（142节），因为祂自己就是救恩和永生。祂就是救恩，因为祂就是救主，这就是耶稣之名的含义；祂就是永生，因为祂在这些人里面，凡在祂里面的，都有永生。这就是为何祂被称为“永生”（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约壹5.20.htm">约翰一书5:20</a>）。既然祂是救恩和永生，那么可知，祂也是引向救恩和永生的一切方法或途径。因此，祂就是改造、重生、更新、复活、成圣、称义、从恶中洁净，最终得救的全部。主在每个人里面赐下这些恩惠，确切地说，祂努力将它们给出去。当人预备好自己，并适合接受它们时，主就会赐下它们。预备并使自己变得适合的活动也出自主，不过，若这个人不以乐意的灵来接受它们，那么主也不能超越这种努力，以引入它们。然而，这种努力是永不停止的。 </p>

150. 去接受上述(<a href="142.htm">142</a>節)強大的屬靈效果的人, 是那些相信主耶穌基督之人。祂是拯救,是永生。祂是拯救, 因為祂是拯救者, 祂的名字耶穌就是此意。祂是永生, 因為那些在祂裡面,祂在他們裡面之人, 有永生。在<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">約翰一書5:20</a>中祂甚至被稱為"永生"。
<p>因為祂是拯救和永生, 就得出, 祂也是引向拯救和永生的一切方法。因而, 祂是改造,更新,復興,啟動,成聖,稱義,潔淨,赦罪, 最終拯救等等引向拯救和永生之方法的全部。對每個人而言, 主都向他們賦予這樣的效果, 因為祂試圖向每一個人這樣做。當某人自行準備好去迎合接收祂, 祂就真切地在這人身上實現了這些效果。但如果人不是以樂意之靈來接收祂, 主就無法在他身上完成這些效果, 不過祂會堅持不懈試圖去成就。 </p>

150. The people who are going to receive the powerful spiritual effects listed above [<a href="142.htm">142</a>] are those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. He is salvation and eternal life. He is salvation because he is the Savior - this is the meaning of his name, Jesus. He is eternal life because those in whom he is and who are in him have eternal life. He is even called "eternal life" in <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>.<p>Now, because the Lord is salvation and eternal life, it follows that he is also everything that enables us to gain salvation and eternal life. Therefore he is every part of reforming, regenerating, renewing, bringing to life, sanctifying, justifying, purifying from evils, and finally saving. The Lord is carrying out these processes in all of us, meaning that he is trying to have these effects on us; and when we adapt and modify ourselves to receive them, he actually carries them out in us. (Even the acts of adapting and modifying ourselves are actually from the Lord.) If we do not accept the Lord's processes with a willing spirit, he cannot carry them out in us, but his desire to do so remains constant. </p>

150. Those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ are to receive those spiritual benefits, because He Himself is salvation and everlasting life. He is salvation, because He is the Saviour, for this is the meaning of His name Jesus; He is everlasting life, because those in whom He is, and who are in Him, have everlasting life. This is why He is called everlasting life in <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>. Now since He is salvation and everlasting life, it follows that He is also every means which leads to salvation and everlasting life. Thus He is the whole of reformation, regeneration, renewal, quickening, sanctification and justification, cleansing from evils, and finally salvation. In the case of every single person the Lord confers these benefits, or rather, He attempts to impart them; and when a person makes himself ready and suitable to receive them, He does impart them. The activity of readying and making oneself suitable comes from the Lord too, but if the person does not receive them with spontaneity of spirit, then the Lord cannot go beyond the attempt to introduce them, and this attempt is constantly kept up. </p>

150. Those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ will receive these spiritual energies for the reason that He Himself is salvation and eternal life. He is salvation since He is the Savior; and this is the meaning of His name Jesus; He is eternal life since those in whom He is and who are in Him have eternal life therefore He is called "eternal life" (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>). Since, then, He is salvation and eternal life, it follows that He is also all that whereby salvation and eternal life are obtained, consequently He is the all of reformation, regeneration, renewal, vivification, sanctification, justification, purification from evils, and finally salvation. These are made operative by the Lord in every man, that is, the Lord strives to impart them; and He does impart them when man adapts and disposes himself for reception. The essential active force by which adaptation and disposition are effected is from the Lord; but unless man receives these operations with a free spirit the Lord cannot go beyond the effort, which, however, unceasingly continues. </p>

150. Those who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ will receive those spiritual virtues, because He Himself is salvation and eternal life. He is salvation because He is the Savior, which His name, Jesus, means; and eternal life, because those have eternal life in whom He is and who are in Him; therefore also He is called eternal life in <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>. Now, because He is salvation and eternal life, it follows that He is all that by which salvation and eternal life are obtained; consequently that He is the all of reformation, regeneration, renewal, vivification, sanctification, justification, purification from evils, and finally salvation. The Lord renders these virtues effective in every man, that is, He endeavors to impart them; and when man adapts and prepares himself for their reception, He does then impart them. The active power itself of adaptation and preparation is also from the Lord; but if the man does not receive them with a willing spirit, the Lord cannot impart these virtues, although He makes the effort to do so without ceasing. </p>

150. Quod credentes in Dominum Jesum Christum accepturi sint spirituales illas virtutes, est quia Ipse est Salus et Vita aeterna, Salus est quia Salvator, haec quoque est nomen Ipsius Jesus, Vita aeterna, quia illis in quibus Ipse est et illi in Ipso, est vita aeterna, quare etiam Ipse vocatur Vita aeterna apud Johannem, I Epist. <a href="3927/1-john_5_21.htm">5:21</a> nunc quia est Salus et Vita aeterna, sequitur quod etiam sit omne id per quod salus et vita aeterna obtinentur, proinde quod sit omne reformationis, regenerationis, innovationis, vivificationis, sanctificationis, justificationis, purificationis a malis, et tandem Salvationis; <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Dominus apud unumquemvis hominem operatur illa, hoc est, conatur inferre illa, et cum homo se accommodat et disponit ad receptionem, infert illa; ipsum activum accommodationis et dispositionis etiam est a Domino, sed si homo non spontaneo <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
