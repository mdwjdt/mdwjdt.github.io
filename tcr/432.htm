<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>432</b>.私人的仁爱义务也有很多，诸如发放工人工资、支付利息、履行合同、保全积蓄等等。其中有些是成文法所强制的义务，有些是普通法所强制的义务，而有些则是道德法所强制的义务。履行这些义务时，有仁爱之人和无仁爱之人的心态也各不相同。有仁爱的人公正忠实地履行这些义务；因为仁爱的戒律就是人人都应当公正忠实地对待所有与他有生意往来或有交往的人（对此，参看422－425节）。但没有仁爱的人履行相同的义务时，就完全不同了。</p>

432. 與義相關的個人責任有很多, 例如付工人報酬,還貸款利息,遵守契約等等。有一些是刑事和民事法律所強制的責任, 有些是道德規範要求的責任。對於有義之人和無義之人, 履行這些責任的心態也各不相同。有義之人公正誠實地完成這些責任, 因為義的原則就是在任何職業或交往中行事公正誠實(參看之前<a href="422.htm">422</a>節及之後內容)。而對於無義之人, 他們履行相同的責任時, 就完全不同了。 </p>

432. There are also many personal obligations related to goodwill, such as paying workers, paying interest on loans, honoring agreements, taking care of deposited valuables, and other things like that. Some of these obligations fall under criminal law, some fall under domestic law, and some fall under moral law. In the case of these obligations, too, people who have goodwill and people who do not, differ in their mindsets. People who have goodwill fulfill these obligations justly and faithfully because it is a principle of goodwill that people should act justly and faithfully toward everyone with whom they have any business or interaction (see 422 and following above). The same obligations are fulfilled quite differently by people who have no goodwill. </p>

432. Private charitable duties are also numerous; for instance, paying workmen their wages, paying interest on loans, honouring promissory notes, keeping deposits safe and such like. Some of these are duties imposed by criminal or civil law, some by moral law. Here too there is a difference in mental attitude between the charitable and the uncharitable. The charitable do these things fairly and in good faith; for it is a commandment of charity that one should deal fairly and in good faith with all with whom one has business or commercial dealings (see above, 422ff). The same acts are performed quite differently by the uncharitable. </p>

432. The private duties of charity are also numerous, such as the payment of wages to workmen, the payment of interest, the fulfillment of contracts, the guarding of securities, and so on, some of which are duties enforced by statute law, some by common law, and some by moral law. These duties also are discharged by those who are in charity from one state of mind, and by those who are not in charity from another state of mind. Those who are in charity perform them justly and faithfully; for it is a precept of charity that everyone should act justly and faithfully toward all with whom he has any business or dealing (on which see <a href="422.htm">422-425</a> above. But those who are not in charity discharge these same duties very differently. </p>

432. The private duties of charity are also numerous, and include the payment of wages to workmen, the payment of interest, the fulfillment of contracts, the keeping of pledges, and other transactions of a like nature, some of which are duties based on statute law, some on civil law, and some on moral law. These duties also are discharged from different motives by those who are in charity and by those who are not. Those who are in charity perform them justly and faithfully; for as may be seen above in <a href="422.htm">422</a>, the law of charity requires that a man should act justly and faithfully with all those with whom he may have any dealings; but the same duties are discharged in a totally different manner by those who are not in charity. </p>

432. DEBITA CHARITATIS PRIVATA sunt etiam plura, sicut pensa solvere operariis, usuras pendere, stipulata praestare, hypothecas custodire, et similia alia, quorum aliqua sunt debita ex Lege forensi, aliqua ex Lege civili, et aliqua ex Lege morali. Haec quoque ex alia mente exhibentur ab illis quae in Charitate sunt, et alia ab illis qui non in Charitate sunt, ab illis qui in Charitate sunt, praestantur illa juste et fideliter, nam praeceptum Charitatis est, ut quis juste et fideliter agat cum omnibus cum quibus in aliquo negotio et commercio est, de quo supra <a href="422.htm">422</a> seq.; eadem illa autem aliter prorsus praestantur ab illis qui non in Charitate sunt. </p>
