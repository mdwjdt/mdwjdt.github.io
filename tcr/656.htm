656. The nature of the relationship between goodwill and faith in people who believe in three gods, but say they believe in one God, was shown earlier [634]. That is, their goodwill is united to their faith only in their outer, earthly self, for the reason that their mind has the idea of three gods while their mouth confesses one God. If at the moment of speaking, their mind were to come forth into what their mouth was saying, it would erase the mention of one God. Instead it would open their lips and unleash its concept of three gods. </p>

656. It was shown above what the combination of charity and faith is like in the case of those who believe in three Gods, while claiming to believe in one; namely, charity combines with faith solely in the external natural man. The reason is that such a person's mind is set on the idea of three gods, while his lips confess only one God. If therefore his mind at that instant were to enter into the confession of his lips, it would blot out the utterance of the words 'one God', and he would open his lips and blurt out the 'three gods' he was thinking about. </p>

656. What the conjunction of charity and faith is in those who believe in three Gods, and yet say that they believe in one, has been shown above; namely, that charity is conjoined with faith in the external natural man only. This is because the mind is then in the idea of three Gods, while the lips confess one; so that if the mind at that moment were to pour itself forth into oral confession, it would prevent the utterance of one God, and would open the lips and proclaim its three Gods. </p>

<p>
656. It has been shown above what is the nature of the union of charity and faith with those who believe in three gods and yet declare they believe in one. It is a union of charity and faith in the external natural man only, for then the mind entertains the idea of three gods, while the lips make confession of one. If, however, the mind, at the moment the lips were speaking, were to infuse itself into the confession of the lips, it would eliminate the mention of one God, and open them to the profession of its own idea of three. </p>

656. Qualis conjunctio charitatis et fidei est apud illos qui credunt in tres Deos, et tamen dicunt se credere in unum, supra ostensum est, scilicet quod Charitas se conjungat cum fide solum in externo naturali homine; causa est, quia mens ejus in idea trium deorum est, et os ejus in confessione unius Dei, quare si mens illo momento infunderet se in confessionem oris, expungeret enuntiationem unius Dei, et aperiret labra et excuteret suos tres Deos. </p>
