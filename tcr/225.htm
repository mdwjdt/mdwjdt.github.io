<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第5节  教会的教义应取自圣言的字义并通过字义来证实</h4><br />225.本章前面部分已说明，圣言的完全、神圣和大能就存在于字义中。由于主是圣言，“是首先的，是末后的”，如祂在《启示录》（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.17.htm">1:17</a>）中所言，故可知，主完全存在于字义中，由此教导和启示世人。这一点须按下列顺序予以说明。<br />⑴没有教义，圣言不被理解。<br />⑵教义应取自圣言的字义。<br />⑶但只有那些从主得到启示的人才能看到属于教义的神圣真理。</p>

225. 教義取自聖言的文字意義並靠文字意義來支撐
<p>在之前段落中曾說明聖言在其文字意義中得以完全, 並在文字意義中賦予神聖和能力。因為主就是聖言, 且是初,是終, 正如祂在(<a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">啟示錄1:17</a>)中所言, 於是得出:主格外地顯現在那層意義中並藉此意義來教導和光照人們。 </p>

225. 5. The Church's Body of Teaching Has to Be Drawn from the Word's Literal Meaning and Supported by It
<p>The preceding part of this chapter showed that the Word is complete, holy, and powerful in the literal meaning. Because the Lord is the Word and is the First and the Last, as he says in <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>, it follows that the Lord is most present in the literal meaning. From it he teaches and enlightens us. These thoughts need to be put forward in the following sequence:
<p>1. The Word is not understandable without a body of teaching.
<p>2. A body of teaching has to be drawn from the Word's literal meaning.
<p>3. Nevertheless, the divine truth needed for a body of teaching becomes manifest only to those who have enlightenment from the Lord. </p>

225. V. The doctrine of the church is to be drawn from the literal sense of the Word and supported by it.<p>It was shown in the preceding paragraph that the Word is in its fulness in the literal sense and endowed with holiness and power. Since the Lord is the Word and is the First and the Last, as He says in Revelation (<a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>), it follows that the Lord is most especially present in that sense and by means of it teaches and enlightens men. But these points must be demonstrated in due order:<p>(i) The Word is not to be understood without doctrine.<p>(ii) Doctrine is to be drawn from the literal sense of the Word.<p>(iii) But Divine truth, on which doctrine is based, is not visible to any but those who are enlightened by the Lord. </p>

225. V. THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE DRAWN FROM THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD, AND CONFIRMED THEREBY. <p>It was shown in the preceding section that the Word is in its fullness, in its holiness, and in its power in the sense of the letter; and since the Lord is the Word and is "the First and the Last" as He says in the Apocalypse (<a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">1:17</a>), it follows that He is fully present in that sense, and that from it He teaches and enlightens man. But this shall be shown in the following order: <p>(1) Without doctrine the Word is not understood. <p>(2) Doctrine should be drawn from the sense of the letter of the Word. <p>(3) But Divine truth, which is of doctrine, can be seen only by those who are in enlightenment from the Lord. </p>

225. V. THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH MUST BE TAKEN FROM THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD, AND BE CONFIRMED BY IT.<p>It was shown in the previous article that the Word, in the sense of the Letter, is in its fulness, its sanctity and its power, and since the Lord is the Word, and the First and the Last, as He declares in the <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>, it follows that He is eminently present in that sense, teaching and enlightening men from it. Proof of this will be given in due order as follows:<p>(1) Without doctrine, the Word is unintelligible.<p>(2) Doctrine must be taken from the sense of the Letter of the Word.<p>(3) But Divine Truth, which is the source of doctrine, is manifest only to those who are enlightened by the Lord. </p>

225. V.<p>Quod Doctrina Ecclesiae ex Sensu literae Verbi haurienda sit, et per illum confirmanda.<p>In praecedente Articulo ostensum est, quod Verbum in Sensu literae sit in suo Pleno, in suo Sancto, et in sua Potentia, et quia Dominus est Verbum, ac Primus et Ultimus, ut Ipse dicit in <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">Apocalypsi 1:17</a>, sequitur, quod Dominus in illo Sensu sit maxime praesens, et quod ex illo doceat et illustret hominem; sed haec demonstranda sunt in hoc ordine, I. Quod Verbum absque Doctrina non intelligatur. II. Quod Doctrina e Verbi Sensu literae haurienda sit[et per illum confirmanda]. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
III. At quod Divinum Verum, quod Doctrinae est, non appareat aliis, quam qui in illustratione <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
