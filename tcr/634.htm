634. The truth should be made public: When a faith in three gods was introduced into the Christian churches, which happened from the time of the Council of Nicaea, all the goodness related to goodwill and all the truth related to faith were sent into exile, because goodwill and faith are incompatible with mental worship of three gods mixed with oral worship of one God. The mind in that case denies what the mouth is saying, and the mouth denies what the mind is thinking. The result is that there is no real faith in three gods and no real faith in one God either.
<p>Clearly, then, from that time on, the Christian temple did not just develop cracks; it collapsed into a pile of rubble. From that time on, the pit of the abyss was opened, and smoke arose from it like the smoke of a great furnace, darkening the sun and the air, and locusts came out of it onto the ground (<a href="3927/revelation_9_2.htm">Revelation 9:2-3</a>; see the explanation of these verses in <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_422.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 422</a>-<a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_425.htm">425</a>). In fact, from that time on, the desolation foretold by Daniel [<a href="3927/daniel_9_2.htm">Daniel 9:2</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_9_26.htm">26-27</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_11_31.htm">11:31</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_12_11.htm">12:11</a>] began and increased (<a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>). The eagles gathered around that faith and its idea that merit can be assigned to us (<a href="3927/matthew_24_28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a>); the eagles in that passage mean the sharp-sighted leaders of the church.
</p>

<p>
[2] If someone responds by pointing out that all the bishops and celebrated men at that council made this decision by a unanimous vote, I would counter by asking whether we should have any faith in councils. Was it not also by a unanimous vote that the Roman Catholic councils decided the pope is the vicar of Christ, saints ought to be invoked, relics and bones should be venerated, and the elements in the Holy Eucharist should be separated? Is this not how they came up with purgatory, indulgences, and so on? Why should we have confidence in councils, when the Synod of Dort, again with a unanimous vote, decided on the detestable notion of predestination and erected it as a central religious icon?
<p>O reader of mine, put your trust in the holy Word rather than in councils, and turn to the Lord and you will be enlightened. The Lord is the Word. That is, the divine truth itself is there. </p>

634. But I shall make the truth known. When belief in three Gods was introduced into the Christian churches, something which happened from the time of the Council of Nicaea on, all the good of charity and all the truth of faith were banished. For these two are in no way compatible with worshipping three Gods in the mind while worshipping one God with the lips. For the mind denies what the lips speak, and the lips deny what the mind thinks. As a result neither is there belief in three Gods, nor in one. This makes it plain that the structure of the Christian church from that time began not merely to crack, but to collapse into rubble. From that time on the pit of the abyss was opened, and from it went up smoke as from a mighty furnace, the sun and the air were darkened, and from the smoke there came forth locusts upon the earth (<a href="3927/revelation_9_2.htm">Revelation 9:2-3</a>). See the explanation of these verses in Apocalypse Revealed. In fact it was from this time that the desolation predicted by Daniel began and increased (<a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>); and it was that faith and its imputing that caused the eagles to gather (<a href="3927/matthew_24_28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a>); eagles there stand for the leaders of the church with their sharp sight.</p>
<p>
[2] If anyone says that this was decreed by the unanimous vote of the Council, in which so many bishops and distinguished scholars took part, how can one trust Councils, when Roman-Catholic Councils also unanimously arrived at the conclusions that the Pope is the vicar of Christ, that saints are to be invoked, images and bones venerated, the Holy Eucharist divided, that purgatory and indulgences and more besides exist? How can one trust councils, when that of Dort, also unanimously, voted in favour of predestination, a detestable heresy, and exalted it as the supreme object of religious veneration? Do not, reader, put your trust in Councils, but in the Holy Word. Approach the Lord and you will be enlightened. For He is the Word, that is to say, the very Divine truth in it. </p>

634. But the truth must be told. When a belief in three Gods was introduced into Christian churches, which was done at the time of the Nicene Council, they banished every good of charity and every truth of faith, because these two are wholly inconsistent with a mental worship of three Gods and a simultaneous oral worship of one God; for the mind then denies what the mouth utters, and the mouth denies what the mind thinks; and the result is that there is neither a belief in three Gods nor a belief in one God. From this it is clear that since that time the Christian temple has not only cracked open but has fallen to ruins; and since that time the mouth of the abyss, from which ascends a smoke like that of a great furnace, has been opened, the sun and air have been darkened, and locusts have gone out therefrom upon the earth (<a href="3927/revelation_9_2.htm">Revelation 9:2-3</a>). (See the explanation of these things in the Apocalypse Revealed.) And from that time also has the desolation foretold by Daniel commenced and increased (<a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>), and to that faith and the imputation thereof the eagles have gathered together (<a href="3927/matthew_24_28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a>, "eagles" there meaning the lynx-eyed leaders of the church). It may be said that a council in which so many bishops and learned men sat together, established this faith by a unanimous vote; but what confidence can be placed in councils, when Roman Catholic councils have also by a unanimous vote established the vicarship of the pope, the invocation of saints, the worship of images and bones, the division of the holy eucharist, purgatory, indulgences, and the like? And what confidence can be placed in councils when the council of Dort has also by a unanimous vote established a detestable predestination, and set it forth as the palladium of religion? But, my reader, believe not in councils, but in the Holy Word; and go to the Lord, and you will be enlightened; for He is the Word, that is, the Divine Truth in the Word. </p>

634. The truth on this subject, however, will now be made known. When a belief in three Gods was introduced into the Christian Churches, which was done at the time of the Nicene Council, <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
they banished all the good of charity and all the truth of faith. These two are wholly inconsistent with the mental worship of three Gods and the lip worship of one God at the same time; for then the mind denies what the mouth speaks, and the mouth denies what the mind thinks, so that at length there is no belief either in three Gods or in one. Hence it is manifest that the Christian temple has, since that time, not merely developed fissures, but has fallen in ruins; and from that time the well of the bottomless pit has been opened, from which smoke like that of a great furnace has ascended, darkening the sun and air, and from which locusts have come upon the earth, <a href="3927/revelation_9_2.htm">Revelation 9:2-3</a>. An explanation of these things may be seen in The Apocalypse Revealed. Indeed from that time the desolation foretold by Daniel has begun and increased, <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>; and to that faith, and the imputation of it, the eagles have been gathered together, verse 28 of the same chapter. Eagles in that passage mean the keen-sighted leaders of the Church.<p>It may be urged that the Nicene Council, which was composed of so many bishops and distinguished scholars, passed its decree by unanimous vote; but what confidence can be placed in councils when Roman Catholic councils, also by unanimous vote, established the Pope's vicarship, the invocation of saints, the worship of images and bones, the division of the Holy Eucharist, <sup "fn9_2">2</sup>
purgatory, indulgences, and so on? What confidence can be placed in councils when the Council of Dort, <sup "fn9_3">3</sup>
also by unanimous vote, decreed the abominable doctrine of predestination, and extolled it as the palladium of religion? But, my reader, do not put your trust in councils, but in the Holy Word, and go to the Lord, and you will be enlightened, for He is the Word, that is, the Divine Truth itself therein.<p>

634. Sed propalabitur veritas; quando Fides in tres Deos in Christianas Ecclesias introducta est, quod factum est a tempore Synodi Nicenae, omne bonum charitatis et omne verum fidei exulaverunt, illa duo enim nullatenus consistunt cum cultu mentali trium deorum, et simul cum cultu orali unius Dei, Mens enim negat quod os loquitur, et os negat quod mens cogitat, inde fit, quod nec sit fides trium Deorum, neque fides Unius. Ex hoc patet, quod Templum Christianum ab eo tempore non modo rimas duxerit, sed collapsum sit in rudera; <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
et quod ab eo tempore apertus sit puteus abyssi, ex quo ascendit fumus sicut fornacis magnae, et obscuratus est Sol et aer, et e quo locustae exiverunt in terram, <a href="3927/revelation_9_2.htm">Apocalypsis 9:2-3</a>; videatur Explicatio illorum in APOCALYPSI REVELATA;</p>

[2] imo ab illo tempore incepta est et increvit Desolatio praedicta a Daniele, <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthaeus 24:15</a>, et ad fidem illam et ejus imputationem congregatae sunt aquilae, Vers. 28, ejusdem Capitis; per aquilas ibi intelliguntur Primores Ecclesiae sicut lyncei. Si dicitur, quod Concilium, in quo consederunt tot Episcopi ac viri laureati, unanimis suffragiis illud decreverint, sed quid fidendum est Conciliis, cum Concilia Romano Catholica etiam unanimis suffragiis concluserunt Vicariatum Papalem, invocationem sanctorum, venerationem simulachrorum et ossium, divisionem Sanctae Eucharistiae, purgatorium, indulgentias, et plura. Et quid fidendum est Conciliis, cum Dodrectanum etiam unanimis suffragiis decrevit detestabilem Praedestinationem, et extulit illam ut Palladium religionis. Sed mi Lector! ne crede Conciliis, sed sancto Verbo, et adi Dominum, et illustraberis; Ille enim est Verbum, hoc est, Ipsum Divinum Verum ibi.<p>
