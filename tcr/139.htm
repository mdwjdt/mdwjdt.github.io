<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>139</b>. （1）圣灵是那一位神（圣三一就在祂里面），即主神救主所发出的神圣真理，以及神性大能和活动。严格来说，圣灵表示神圣真理，因而也表示圣言；就这层意义而言，主自己就是圣灵。但如今教会用“圣灵”来描述神作工的方式，也就是使人成为公义的实际过程，故这就是此处为圣灵所取的含义，也是主要论述的主题。另外一个原因是，发出者与发出它的源头具有同一个本质，如同这三合一，即灵魂、身体和这二者所发出的一起构成一个本质。在人里面，这个本质就是纯粹的人；而在主里面，它是神性，同时也是人性；在祂得荣耀之后，这些本质融合起来，如同在先者与在后者，或本质与它的形式融合起来。因此，被称为父、子、圣灵的这三要素在主里面为一。<br />我在前面已说明，主是神圣真理本身，或神性事实。以下经文会证明，圣灵就是神圣真理：<br />从耶西的树墩子必生出一根枝条来。耶和华的灵必住在祂身上，就是智慧和明达之灵，谋略和能力之灵；祂将以口中的杖击打这地，以嘴里的气杀死恶人；公义必做祂的腰带，真理必做祂胁下的带子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.1.htm">以赛亚书11:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.5.htm">5</a>）<br />仇敌必像狭急的河流冲来，耶和华的灵必必高举旌旗抵挡他；然后必有一位救赎主来到锡安。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.19.htm">以赛亚书59:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.20.htm">20</a>）<br />主耶和华的灵在我身上；因为耶和华膏了我，叫我传好消息给贫穷的人。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.1.htm">以赛亚书61:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.18.htm">路加福音4:18</a>）<br />这是我的约。我加给你的灵，我的话必不离你的口，从今直到永远！（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.21.htm">以赛亚书59:21</a>）<br />由于主是真理本身，故凡从祂发出的一切皆为真理，这就是保惠师的意思，祂还被称为真理的圣灵、圣灵。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：<br />我将真情告诉你们，我去是与你们有益的。我若不去，保惠师就不到你们这里来；我若去，就差祂到你们这里来。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.7.htm">约翰福音16:7</a>）<br />只等真理的圣灵来了，祂要引导你们进入一切的真理，因为祂不是凭着自己说的，乃是要把祂所听见的都说出来。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.13.htm">约翰福音16:13</a>）<br />祂要荣耀我，因为祂必从我领受，而传告你们。凡父所有的都是我的，故此我说，祂从我领受，就要传告你们。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.14.htm">约翰福音16:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.15.htm">15</a>）<br />我要求父，父就另外赐给你们一位保惠师，就是真理的圣灵，乃是这个世界不能接受的，因为它看不见祂，也不认识祂；你们却认识祂，因祂与你们同住，并且要在你们里面。我必不撇下你们为孤儿；我必到你们这里来；你们却看见我。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.16.htm">约翰福音14:16</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.19.htm">19</a>）<br />我从父那里差给你们的保惠师，就是真理的圣灵到来时，祂必为我作见证。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.26.htm">约翰福音14:26</a>）<br />祂被称为圣灵。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.26.htm">约翰福音14:26</a>）<br />主所说的“保惠师”、“圣灵”是指祂自己，这从祂的话明显可知，即“这个世界不认识祂”：<br />你们却认识祂；我必不撇下你们为孤儿；我必到你们这里来；你们却看见我。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.17.htm">约翰福音14:17</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.19.htm">19</a>）<br />还有：<br />看啊，我常与你们同在，直到世代的末了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.20.htm">马太福音28:20</a>）<br />以及这些话：“<br />还可从主的话：“祂不是凭着自己说的，而是从我领受的” 。</p>

<p>
139. (1)聖靈是從獨一上帝發出的神性真理,以及神性活動和功效; 聖三一存在於這位獨一上帝之中, 祂就是主上帝拯救者。
<p>聖靈的確表示神性真理(聖理)之意, 因此也表示聖言(或道)。就此意義而言, 主自己事實上就是聖靈。然而, 現今教會將"聖靈"定義為上帝(確切地使人稱義的那部分神性)的神性活動, 因此, 神性活動就是我們此處討論時以"聖靈"來表示的意思。另外, 神性活動的發生是通過由主發出的神性真理來成就。所發出的與其源頭的本質是一,且相同。就如同某人的的靈魂,某人的身體和某人的活動, 三者共用一個相同的本質。在人而言, 只是純粹的人的本質。但在主而言, 就同時是神性的本質和人的本質。在主榮耀之後(就是受難復活之後), 這兩個本質完全聯合; 如同因與果,或本質與形式的聯合。因此, 這三要素, 就是稱為父,子和聖靈, 在主裡為一了。
<p>[2]我之前已說明過(參閱<a href="85.htm">85</a>節第3小節), 主是神性真理(或聖理)。至於聖靈是神性真理, 從下面經文可明顯看出:
<p>從耶西的樹墩子必生出一根枝條來。耶和華的靈必住在祂身上, 就是智慧和明達之靈, 謀略和能力之靈。祂將以祂口中之杖擊打這地, 將以嘴裡的靈殺死惡人。公義必做祂的腰間的圍帶, 真理必做祂脅下的束巾(<a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">以賽亞書11:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_4.htm">4-5</a>)。仇敵像狹急的河流沖來; 耶和華的靈必豎旗抵擋。然後贖回主將來到錫安(<a href="3927/isaiah_59_19.htm">以賽亞書59:19-20</a>)。主耶和華的靈在我身上; 耶和華膏了我, 祂已差我傳好消息給貧窮的人(<a href="3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">以賽亞書61:1</a>;<a href="3927/luke_4_18.htm">路加福音4:18</a>)。這是我跟他們立的約∶我的靈加於你身上, 我的話永不離開你的口(<a href="3927/isaiah_59_21.htm">以賽亞書59:21</a>)。
<p>[3]因為主是絕對的真理, 從祂而發出的一切都是真理。所有這些真理, 就是我們所知道的"保惠師", 還被稱為"真理的靈",以及"聖靈"。下列章節可以證明:
<p>我將真情告訴你們∶我去,是于你們有益的。我若不去, 那保惠師將不會到你們這裡來; 我若去, 就要差祂來(<a href="3927/john_16_7.htm">約翰福音16:7</a>)。只等那一位真理之靈來了, 祂就要引導你們進入一切的真理。因為祂不是憑著自己來說話, 祂乃是要把所聽見的都說出來(<a href="3927/john_16_13.htm">約翰福音16:13</a>)。保惠師必榮耀我, 因為祂必從我領受, 而傳告你們。凡父所有的都是我的, 故此我說,祂從我領受, 就要傳告你們(<a href="3927/john_16_14.htm">約翰福音16:14-15</a>)。我要求父, 祂就必將另一位保惠師賜給你們, 就是真理之靈,世人所不能領受的, 因為看不見祂, 也不認識祂; 你們呢,卻認識祂, 因為祂與你們同住, 並且要在你們裡面。我必不撇下你們為孤兒; 我必來找你們(<a href="3927/john_14_16.htm">約翰福音14:16-18</a>)。那保惠師,我從父那裡所要差來找你們的,真理之靈,從父而出的, 那一位來的時候,就要為我作見證了(<a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">約翰福音15:26</a>)。保惠師被稱為"聖靈"(<a href="3927/john_14_26.htm">約翰福音14:26</a>)。
<p>[4]當提到"保惠師"和"聖靈"時, 主用來指祂自己。從以下之話顯而易見:"世界不認識祂,但你們認識祂; 我必不撇下你們為孤兒; 我必來找你們。"還有, "看啊, 我一直與你們同在, 直到世代的末了"(<a href="3927/matthew_28_20.htm">馬太福音28:20</a>)。還可從主的話:"祂不憑自己講, 而是從我領受的。" </p>

139. 1. The Holy Spirit is the divine truth and also the divine action and effect that radiate from the one God, in whom the divine Trinity exists: the Lord God the Savior. The Holy Spirit really means the divine truth; therefore it also means the Word. In this sense, the Lord himself is in fact the Holy Spirit. Nevertheless, because the church nowadays characterizes the Holy Spirit as the divine action (meaning that part of the Divine that actually justifies us), therefore the divine action is what we mean by "the Holy Spirit" in the discussion here. For another thing, divine action takes place through the divine truth that radiates from the Lord. Whatever radiates out has one and the same essence as the source it radiates from. Take for example someone's soul, someone's body, and someone's effect: these three together share one essence. In us that essence is merely human. In the Lord there was a divine essence and also a human one. After the Lord's glorification these two essences were as completely united as a cause is with its effect or an essence with its form. Therefore three essential components, called the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are one in the Lord.
</p>
<p>
[2] I have already demonstrated that the Lord is divine trueness or truth [see ]. As for the Holy Spirit being divine truth, the following passages make this clear:
<p>A branch will come out of the trunk of Jesse. The spirit of Jehovah will rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and intelligence, the spirit of counsel and strength. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the spirit of his lips he will kill the ungodly. Justice will be his loincloth, and the truth will wrap his thighs. (<a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">Isaiah 11:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_4.htm">4-5</a>)
<p>He will arrive like a narrow river; the spirit of Jehovah will lift up a standard against him. Then the Redeemer will come to Zion. (<a href="3927/isaiah_59_19.htm">Isaiah 59:19-20</a>)
<p>The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon me. Jehovah has anointed me. He has sent me to proclaim the good news to the poor. (<a href="3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>; <a href="3927/luke_4_18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>)
<p>This is my covenant. My spirit that is upon you, my words, will not leave your mouth from now on forevermore. (<a href="3927/isaiah_59_21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>)
</p>
<p>
[3] Since the Lord is absolute truth, everything that radiates from him is truth. All this truth is known as the Comforter, which is also called the Spirit of Truth and the Holy Spirit, as the following passages clearly show:
<p>I tell you the truth: it is better for you that I go away, because if I do not go away the Comforter will not come to you; but if I do go away I will send him to you. (<a href="3927/john_16_7.htm">John 16:7</a>)
<p>When the Spirit of Truth comes, he will lead you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; rather, whatever he hears he will say. (<a href="3927/john_16_13.htm">John 16:13</a>)
<p>[The Comforter] will glorify me because he will take from what is mine and will make it known to you. Everything the Father has is mine. This is why I said that [the Comforter] will take from what is mine and will make it known to you. (<a href="3927/john_16_14.htm">John 16:14-15</a>)
<p>I will ask the Father to give another Comforter to you, the Spirit of Truth. The world cannot accept him because it does not see him or recognize him; but you know him because he dwells among you and will be in you. I will not leave you
<p>orphans; I am coming to you and you will see me. (<a href="3927/john_14_16.htm">John 14:16-18</a>)
<p>When the Comforter comes - the Spirit of Truth whom I am going to send you from the Father - he will testify about me. (<a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>)
<p>The Comforter is called "the Holy Spirit" (<a href="3927/john_14_26.htm">John 14:26</a>).
</p>
<p>
[4] In mentioning the Comforter and the Holy Spirit, the Lord was referring to himself. This is clear from these words of his: "the world would not recognize him but you know him; I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you; you will see me. " And elsewhere, "Behold I am with you every day, even to the close of the age" (<a href="3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). Also from the Lord's saying, "He will not speak from himself; instead he will take from what is mine. " </p>

139. (i) THE HOLY SPIRIT IS DIVINE TRUTH, AND ALSO THE DIVINE POWER AND ACTIVITY WHICH PROCEEDS FROM THE ONE GOD, IN WHOM IS THE DIVINE TRINITY, AND SO FROM THE LORD GOD THE SAVIOUR.<p>The Holy Spirit means properly the Divine Truth, so also the Word; and in this sense the Lord is Himself also the Holy Spirit. But the present-day church uses the term 'Holy Spirit' to describe the way God works, that is, the actual process of making a person righteous, so this is the meaning given here to the Holy Spirit, and this will be the principal subject discussed. Another reason is that the activity of God takes place by means of the Divine Truth which proceeds from the Lord; and that which proceeds is of one and the same essence as He from whom it proceeds. This is like the trio of soul, body and what proceeds making up a single essence, which in the case of a human being is purely human, but in the case of the Lord is Divine and human at the same time, these essences after His glorification being united as what is prior is with what follows from it, or like essence and the appropriate form. So the three essentials called the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are one in the Lord.</p>
<p>
[2] I showed before that the Lord is the Divine Truth itself or Divine Verity. The following passages will prove that the Holy Spirit is Divine Truth.<p>A shoot will come forth from the stock of Jesse. The spirit of Jehovah will rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and intelligence, the spirit of counsel and power. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked. Righteousness will be the belt around his loins, and truth the belt around his thighs, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">Isaiah 11:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_4.htm">4-5</a>.<p>He shall come like a narrow stream, the spirit of Jehovah shall advance his standard against him, then shall the Redeemer come from Zion, <a href="3927/isaiah_59_19.htm">Isaiah 59:19-20</a>.<p>The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon me. Jehovah has anointed me. He has sent me to preach the gospel to the poor, <a href="3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>; <a href="3927/luke_4_18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>.<p>This is my covenant. My spirit which is upon you and my words shall not depart from your mouth from now on for ever, <a href="3927/isaiah_59_21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] Since the Lord is Truth itself, then everything that proceeds from Him is truth, and this is what is meant by the Comforter, who is also called the Spirit of Truth and the Holy Spirit. The following passages will prove this:<p>I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I should go away. For if I were not to go away, the Comforter will not come to you. But if I go away, I will send him to you, <a href="3927/john_16_7.htm">John 16:7</a>.<p>When the Spirit of Truth comes, he will lead you to all truth. He will not speak of himself, but will say whatever he has heard, <a href="3927/john_16_13.htm">John 16:13</a>.<p>He will glorify me, because he will take from what is mine and communicate it to you. All things that the Father has are mine. This is why I have said that he will take from what is mine and communicate it to you, <a href="3927/john_16_14.htm">John 16:14-15</a>.<p>I will ask the Father to give you another Comforter, the Spirit of truth, which the world cannot receive, because it neither sees nor knows him. But you know him, because he remains with you and will be in you. I shall not leave you bereft, I am coming to you and you will see me, <a href="3927/john_14_16.htm">John 14:16-19</a>.<p>When the Comforter comes whom I shall send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, he will bear witness about me, <a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>.<p>He is called the Holy Spirit, <a href="3927/john_14_26.htm">John 14:26</a>.</p>
<p>
[4] The Lord meant Himself by 'the Comforter' or 'the Holy Spirit', as is clear from His own saying about the world not yet knowing him, 'But you know Him'; 'I will not leave you bereft, I am coming to you'; 'You will see Me'; and elsewhere 'Behold I am with you every day until the ending of the age' (<a href="3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). This is further shown by the expression 'He will not speak of Himself, but that which He receives from me.' </p>

<p>
139. (1) The Holy Spirit is the Divine Truth and also the Divine Energy and Operation proceeding from the one God in whom is the Divine Trinity, that is, from the Lord God the Savior. The Holy Spirit signifies strictly the Divine truth, thus also the Word; and in this sense the Lord Himself is the Holy Spirit. But since in the church at this day the Divine operation, which is actually justification, is what is meant by the Holy Spirit, this is here taken to be the Holy Spirit, and is what is chiefly treated of. This is done for the further reason that the Divine operation is effected by means of the Divine truth which goes forth from the Lord; and that which goes forth is of one and the same essence with Him from whom it goes forth, as the three things, soul, body, and what goes forth from them, together constitute one essence, which in man is purely human, but in the Lord is Divine and Human at the same time; and these after glorification are united as what is prior is with its posterior, or as essence is with its form. Thus the three essentials, called Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, are one in the Lord.
</p>
<p>
[2] That the Lord is the Divine truth itself, or the Divine verity, has been shown above. That the Holy Spirit is the same is manifest from the following passages: <p>There shall go forth a Shoot out of the stock of Jesse; the spirit of Jehovah shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and might; and He shall smite the land with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips shall He slay the wicked; and righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins, and truth the girdle of His thighs (<a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">Isaiah 11:1, 2</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_4.htm">4, 5</a>). <p>He shall come like a narrow flood; the Spirit of Jehovah shall lift up a standard against him; then a Redeemer shall come to Zion (<a href="3927/isaiah_59_19.htm">Isaiah 59:19, 20</a>). <p>The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon Me; therefore Jehovah hath anointed Me, He hath sent Me to preach good tidings unto the poor (<a href="3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>; <a href="3927/luke_4_18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). <p>This is My covenant; My spirit that is upon thee, and My words shall not depart out of thy mouth from henceforth and for ever (<a href="3927/isaiah_59_21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] As the Lord is truth itself, all that goes forth from Him is truth, and this is what is meant by the Comforter, who is also called the Spirit of truth and the Holy Spirit. This is evident from the following passages: <p>I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I go away I will send Him unto you (<a href="3927/john_16_7.htm">John 16:7</a>). <p>When He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth for He will not speak from Himself, but whatsoever things He shall hear shall He speak (<a href="3927/john_16_13.htm">John 16:13</a>). <p>He shall glorify Me; for He shall take of Mine and shall declare it unto you. All things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine therefore said I that He shall take of Mine and shall declare it unto you (<a href="3927/john_16_14.htm">John 16:14, 15</a>). <p>I will ask the Father to give you another Comforter, the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him; but ye know Him, for He abideth with you and shall be in you. I will not leave you orphans; I come to you: and ye shall see Me (<a href="3927/john_14_16.htm">John 14:16-19</a>). <p>When the Comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, He shall bear witness of Me (<a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>). <p>He is called the Holy Spirit (<a href="3927/john_14_26.htm">John 14:26</a>).
</p>
<p>
[4] That by "the Comforter" or "the Holy Spirit" the Lord meant Himself, is evident from His words, that the world had not yet known Him: <p>But ye know Him; I will not leave you orphans; I come to you; ye shall see Me (<a href="3927/john_14_17.htm">John 14:17-19</a>); <p>and in another passage: <p>Lo I am with you always, even unto the consummation of the age (<a href="3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>); <p>also from these words, "He shall not speak from Himself," but "He shall take of Mine." </p>

139. (1) THE HOLY SPIRIT IS THE DIVINE TRUTH, AND ALSO THE DIVINE VIRTUE AND OPERATION PROCEEDING FROM THE ONE GOD, IN WHOM IS THE DIVINE TRINITY, THUS FROM THE LORD GOD THE SAVIOR.<p>The Holy Spirit, strictly speaking, signifies the Divine Truth, thus also the Word; and in this sense the Lord Himself is also the Holy Spirit. Since, however, in the Church at this day the Holy Spirit is regarded as the Divine Operation, which in reality is justification, therefore this is here assumed to be the Holy Spirit. This, moreover, is being specially treated because the Divine Operation is effected by means of the Divine Truth, which proceeds from the Lord; and that which proceeds is of one and the same essence with Him from whom it proceeds; like these three, the soul, the body and the proceeding activity, which together constitute one essence. With man this is merely human, but with the Lord it is Divine and at the same time Human, such a union having been effected after glorification as exists between what is prior and its posterior, and between an essence and its form. Thus the three Essentials, which are called Father, Son and Holy Spirit, are one in the Lord.</p>
<p>
[2] It was shown above that the Lord is Divine Truth itself, or the Divine Verity; and that the Holy Spirit is also the same is evident from the following passages:<p>"And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse...

[3] Since the Lord is Truth itself, therefore everything that proceeds from Him is truth; and this is meant by the Comforter, who is also called the Spirit of Truth, and the Holy Spirit, as is evident from the following passages:<p>"Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you" <a href="3927/john_16_7.htm">John 16:7</a>.<p>"When He, the Spirit of truth is come, He will guide you into all truth: for He shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak" <a href="3927/john_16_13.htm">John 16:13</a>.<p>"He shall glorify me; for He shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that He shall take of mine, and shall show it unto you" <a href="3927/john_16_14.htm">John 16:14-15</a>.<p>"And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter... even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him: but ye know Him for He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you," and ye shall see me <a href="3927/john_14_16.htm">John 14:16-19</a>.<p>"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth... He shall testify of me" <a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>;<p>and in <a href="3927/john_14_26.htm">John 14:26</a> He is called the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
[4] That the Lord by the Comforter, or Holy Spirit, meant Himself is evident from His saying, that the world knew Him not:<p>"But ye know Him; I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you; and ye shall see me." And in another place He says: "I am with you always, even unto the end of the age. (A.V. world) <a href="3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>.<p>It is evident also from His saying that He shall not speak from Himself, but He shall take of mine. </p>

139. I. QUOD SPIRITUS SANCTUS SIT DIVINA VERITAS, ET QUOQUE DIVINA VIRTUS ET OPERATIO PROCEDENS A DEO UNO, IN QUO EST DIVINA TRINITAS, ITA A DOMINO DEO SALVATORE. Per Spiritum Sanctum proprie significatur Divinum Verum, ita quoque Verbum, et in hoc sensu est Ipse Dominus etiam Spiritus Sanctus; sed quia in Ecclesia hodie per Spiritum Sanctum describitur Divina Operatio, quae est actualis Justificatio, ideo haec pro Spiritu Sancto hic assumitur, et de hac praecipue agitur, etiam ex causa, quia Divina Operatio fit per Divinum Verum, quod ex Domino procedit, et id quod procedit, est unius et ejusdem essentiae <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
cum Ipso a quo procedit, <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
sicut Tria haec, Anima, Corpus, et Procedens, quae simul faciunt unam Essentiam, apud hominem mere Humanam, apud Dominum autem Divinam et simul Humanam, post Glorificationem ita unitas, sicut Prius cum <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
suo Posteriori, ac sicut Essentia cum sua Forma; ita tria Essentialia, quae vocantur Pater, Filius, et Spiritus Sanctus in Domino unum sunt.</p>
<p>
[2] Quod Dominus sit ipsum Divinum Verum, seu Divina Veritas, supra ostensum est; quod autem Spiritus Sanctus sit illud, constat ex his locis, Exibit virga e trunco Jishaii, <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
quiescet super Ipso Spiritus Jehovae, Spiritus sapientiae et intelligentiae, Spiritus consilii et virtutis, percutiet terram virga oris sui, et spiritu labiorum suorum occidet impium, erit justitia <sup "fn120_5">5</sup>
cingulum lumborum Ejus, et Veritas cingulum feminum ejus, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">Esaias 11:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_4.htm">4-5</a>. <sup "fn120_6">6</sup>
Veniet sicut flumen angustum, Spiritus Jehovae signum inferet in Illum, tunc veniet Zioni Redemptor, <a href="3927/isaiah_59_19.htm">Esaias 59:19-20</a>. Spiritus Domini Jehovih super Me, unxit Me Jehovah, ad evangelizandum pauperibus misit Me, <a href="3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">Esaias 61:1</a>; <a href="3927/luke_4_18.htm">Luca 4:18</a>. Hoc foedus meum, Spiritus meus qui super Te, et verba mea non recedent ex ore tuo a nunc et in aeternum, <a href="3927/isaiah_59_21.htm">Esaias 59:21</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] Quoniam Dominus est ipsa Veritas, inde omne id quod procedit ex Ipso est veritas, et hoc intelligitur per Paracletum, qui etiam nominatur Spiritus veritatis, et Spiritus <sup "fn120_7">7</sup>
Sanctus; hoc constat ex his locis, Ego VERITATEM vobis dico, prodest vobis ut Ego abeam, si enim non abirem, Paracletus non veniet ad vos; si vero abivero, mittam illum ad vos, <a href="3927/john_16_7.htm">Johannes 16:7</a>. Quando venerit ille SPIRITUS VERITATIS, ducet vos in OMNEM VERITATEM: non loquetur <sup "fn120_8">8</sup>
a se ipso, sed quaecunque audiverit, loquetur, <a href="3927/john_16_13.htm">Johannes 16:13</a>. Ille Me glorificabit, quia EX MEO accipiet, et annuntiabit vobis: omnia quaecunque Pater habet, MEA <sup "fn120_9">9</sup>
sunt, propter hoc dixi, quod a MEO accepturus sit, et annuntiaturus vobis, <a href="3927/john_16_14.htm">Johannes 16:14-15</a>. Ego rogabo <sup "fn120_10">10</sup>
Patrem, ut alium Paracletum det vobis, SPIRITUM VERITATIS, quem Mundus non potest accipere, quoniam non videt illum, nec cognoscit illum; vos autem cognoscitis illum, quia apud vos manet, et in vobis erit; non relinquam vos orphanos, venio ad vos, et vos videbitis Me, <a href="3927/john_14_16.htm">Johannes 14:16-17</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_18.htm">18-19</a>. <sup "fn120_11">11</sup>
Quando venerit Paracletus, quem Ego missurus sum vobis a Patre, SPIRITUS VERITATIS, Ille testabitur de Me, <a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">Johannes 15:26</a>: vocatur Ille Spiritus Sanctus, <a href="3927/john_14_26.htm">Johannes 14:26</a>.</p>
<p>
[4] Quod Dominus per Paracletum seu Spiritum Sanctum intellexerit Se ipsum, patet ab illis Domini verbis, quod Mundus illum adhuc non cognosceret, vos autem cognoscitis illum; non relinquam vos orphanos, venio ad vos, vos videbitis Me: et alibi, Ecce Ego vobiscum sum omnibus diebus usque ad consummationem saeculi, <a href="3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthaeus 28:20</a>, tum ex illis, Non loquetur ex Seipso, sed quod ex Meo accepturus sit.<p>
