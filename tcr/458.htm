<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>458</b>.这清楚表明爱主与爱邻之间结合的性质和起源；神对人类的爱流入进来，而人对它的接受及其合作却是对邻之爱。总之，结合是照着主的这番话实现的：<br />到那日，你们就知道我在父里面，你们在我里面，我也在你们里面。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">约翰福音14:20</a>）<br />还有：<br />有了我的命令又遵守的，这人就是爱我的，我也要爱他，并且要向他显现；我们要与他同住。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.21.htm">约翰福音14:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.23.htm">23</a>）<br />主所有的诫命都关系到爱邻，总之，它们就是不向邻行恶，而是向他行善。凡这样做的人就是爱神，神也爱他们，这和主的这些话是一致的。因为这就是这两种爱的结合，所以约翰说：<br />遵守耶稣基督诫命的，就住在祂里面，祂也住在他里面。人若说：“我爱神，”却恨他的弟兄，就是说谎话的；不爱他所看见的弟兄，怎能爱没有看见的神呢？爱神的，也当爱弟兄，这是我们从神所受的命令（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约壹3.24.htm">约翰一书3:24</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约壹4.20.htm">4:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约壹4.21.htm">21</a>）。</p>

<p>
458. 這些例證可以清楚說明愛上帝與愛鄰舍之間聯合的起源與性質:上帝對人的愛注入, 人接收這愛並配合, 就成了對鄰舍之愛。
<p>簡而言之, 這樣的連接與主所說的下列話一致:到那日, 你們就知道我在父裡面, 你們在我裡面, 我也在你們裡面(<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">約翰福音14:20</a>)。
<p>還有這些話:有了我的命令又遵守的, 這人就是愛我的; 我會愛他, 並向他顯現, 並且與他同住(<a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">約翰福音14:21-23</a>)。
<p>主所有的命令都與愛鄰舍相關。它們所包含的, 簡單地說, 就是不向鄰舍作惡, 而是向他們行善。照上面引用主的話, 像這樣的人愛上帝, 上帝也愛他們。
<p>因為愛上帝與愛鄰舍以如此方式連接, 所以約翰說:遵守耶穌基督誡命的, 就住在祂裡面, 祂也住在他裡面。人若說:"我愛上帝, "卻恨他的弟兄, 就是說謊話的; 不愛他所看見的弟兄, 怎能愛沒有看見的上帝呢？愛上帝的, 也當愛弟兄, 這是我們從上帝所受的命令(<a href="3927/1-john_3_24.htm">約翰一書3:24</a>; <a href="3927/1-john_4_20.htm">4:20-21</a>)。 </p>

458. These points clarify where the connection between loving God and loving our neighbor comes from and what it is like: God's love for people flows into us; when we receive that love and cooperate with it, it becomes love for our neighbor.
<p>Briefly put, the connection accords with the following saying of the Lord's:
<p>On that day you will recognize that I am in my Father and you are in me and I am in you. (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>)
<p>And this saying:
<p>The people who love me are those who have my commandments and do them. I will love these people, manifest myself to them, and make a home with them. (<a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-23</a>)
<p>All the Lord's commandments relate to loving our neighbor. In summary form, they involve not doing evil to our neighbors, and instead doing them good. According to the Lord's words just quoted, people like this love God and God loves them.
<p>Because love for God and love for our neighbor are connected in this way, John says:
<p>Those who keep the commandments of Jesus Christ live in him, and he lives in them. If any say, "I love God in every way" but hate their brothers and sisters, they are liars. If they do not love their brothers and sisters, whom they see, how can they love God whom they do not see? This commandment we have from him: that people who love God also love their brothers and sisters. (<a href="3927/1-john_3_24.htm">1 John 3:24</a>; <a href="3927/1-john_4_20.htm">4:20-21</a>) </p>

458. These illustrations make plain the origin and nature of the link between love to God and love towards the neighbour; the love of God towards mankind flows in, and it is its reception by the person and his co-operation which are love towards the neighbour. In short, it is linking, as expressed in this saying of the Lord's:<p>On that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I in you, <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>.<p>And as this saying puts it:<p>He who has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me; and I shall love him, and show myself to him, and I shall make my dwelling with him, <a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-23</a>.<p>All the Lord's commandments have to do with love towards the neighbour, and they are, in short, not to do evil to him, but to do him good. These people love God and God loves them, as stated by the Lord's words just quoted. It is because those two loves are so linked that John says:<p>He who keeps the commandments of Jesus Christ remains in Him, and He in him. If anyone says, 'I utterly love God,' but hates his brother, he is a liar. For if someone does not love his brother whom he can see, how can he love God whom he cannot see? We have this commandment from Him, that if anyone loves God, he should also love his brother. <a href="3927/1-john_3_24.htm">1 John 3:24</a>; <a href="3927/1-john_4_20.htm">4:20-21</a>. </p>

458. This makes clear the origin and the nature of the conjunction of love to God and love towards the neighbor, as being the influx of God's love for men, the reception of which by man and his cooperation therewith being love towards the neighbor. In a word, conjunction is effected in accordance with this saying of the Lord: <p>At that day ye shall know that I am in My Father, and ye in Me, and I in you (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>). <p>Also according to this, <p>He that hath My commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself unto him; and We will make abode with him (<a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-23</a>). <p>All of the Lord's commandments have relation to love towards the neighbor, and in a word they are not doing evil to the neighbor, but doing good to him. That those who do this love God and God loves them, is in accordance with these words of the Lord. Because such is the conjunction of these two loves, John says: <p>He that keepeth the commandments of Jesus Christ abideth in Him and He in him. If a man say, I love God, but hateth his brother, he is a liar; for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? And this commandment have we from Him, That he who loveth God should love his brother also (1<a href="3927/1-john_3_24.htm">John 3:24</a>; <a href="3927/1-john_4_20.htm">4:20, 21</a>). </p>

<p>
458. From this it is evident what is the origin and nature of the conjunction of love to God and love towards the neighbor. It arises from the influx of God's love towards men and its reception by man, which, together with his co-operation in its exercise, constitutes Love towards the neighbor. In short, conjunction is described in these words of the Lord:<p>"At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you" <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>;<p>and also in these words:<p>"He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that love me... and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him, and will make my abode with him" <a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_23.htm">23</a>.<p>All the Lord's commandments have relation to love towards the neighbor, and consist in these two general precepts, not to do evil to him, but to do good to him. Those who observe these precepts love God, and God loves them, according to these words of the Lord; and since the love of God and the love of the neighbor are thus conjoined it is as John says:<p>"He that keepeth the commandments of Jesus Christ (A.V., His commandments) dwelleth in Him, and He in him" <a href="3927/1-john_3_24.htm">1 John 3:24</a>.<p>"If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? And this commandment have we from Him, That he who loveth God love his brother also" <a href="3927/1-john_4_20.htm">1 John 4:20-21</a>. </p>

458. Ex his patet, unde et qualis est Conjunctio amoris in Deum et amoris erga proximum, quod sit influxus Amoris Dei erga homines, et quod ejus receptio ab homine, et cooperatio apud illum, sit amor erga proximum; in summa, est conjunctio secundum hoc Verbum Domini, In illa die cognoscetis, quod Ego in Patre meo, et vos in Me, et Ego in vobis, <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">Johannes 14:20</a>. Et secundum hoc Verbum, Qui habet praecepta mea et facit illa, ille est qui amat Me, et Ego amabo illum, et manifestabo illi Me Ipsum; et mansionem apud illum faciam, <a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">Johannes 14:21-23</a>. Praecepta Domini omnia se referunt ad amorem erga proximum, quae in summa sunt, non facere ei malum, sed facere ei bonum; quod illi ament Deum, et Deus amet illos, est secundum illa verba Domini. Quoniam bini illi Amores ita conjuncti sunt, dicit Johannes, Qui servat mandata Jesu Christi, in Ipso manet, et Ipse in illo. Si quis dicat, omnino Amos Deum, sed fratrem suum oderit, mendax est: qui enim non amat fratrem suum quem videt, Deum, quem non videt, quomodo potest amare; hoc mandatum habemus ab Ipso, ut qui amat Deum, amet etiam fratrem suum, <a href="3927/1-john_3_24.htm">1 Johannes 3:24</a>, et Cap. <a href="3927/1-john_4_20.htm">4:20-21</a>. </p>
