<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>735</b>.此后，天人转向持有以下观点的人，即天堂喜乐与永恒幸福就是和亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各一同坐席，然后是节日游戏和娱乐，随之又是盛宴，如此持续到永远，对他们说：“跟我来，我会带你们进入你们的喜乐所给予的欢乐享受中。”于是，他领他们穿过一片小树林，来到一块铺着木板的空地上，那里已摆好桌子，两边各有十五张。他们问为何有这么多桌子，天人回答说：“第一张桌子是亚伯拉罕的，第二张是以撒的，第三张是雅各的，然后依次排列的桌子是十二使徒的；对面的十五张是他们妻子的，头三张是给亚伯拉罕的妻子撒拉，以撒的妻子利百加，以及雅各的妻子利亚与拉结的，剩下的十二张是给十二使徒妻子的。”<br />过了一会儿，就看到所有桌子上摆满了菜肴，空档处还点缀了糖果小金字塔。客人们站在桌子周围，等候翘望主持的人。稍后，他们来了，按着从亚伯拉罕到最后一位使徒的顺序鱼贯而入，各自马上来到自己的桌前，坐在沙发的一头，然后邀请周围站着的人：“你们也请入坐吧。”于是，男人便与族长同坐，女人则与他们的妻子同坐，他们开怀畅饮，尽情吃喝。餐毕，族长们出去，然后游戏开始了，少男少女们则翩翩起舞，再后是文艺演出。这些活动结束后，他们又被邀赴宴，但规则是，第一天他们要与亚伯拉罕同吃喝，第二天与以撒，第三天与雅各，第四天与彼得，第五天与雅各，第六天与约翰，第七天与保罗，依次类推，直到第十五天，此后再按同样顺序重新赴宴，仅仅改变地方，如此反复，直到永远。<br />然后，天人将这组人召集起来，对他们说：“你们看到的所有坐席者，在思想天堂喜乐与永恒幸福时，和你们幻想得一样。为了让他们亲自认清自己的想法何等虚荣，并从中退离，蒙主允许安排了这些宴会和表演。你们看到的坐首席者，只不过是假扮的古人；他们大多数人是蓄着胡须的乡野村夫，因有点小财就得意忘形，幻想他们是古时的族长。请随我离开这个练习场。”<br />于是，他们就跟着他，看到这里有五十人，那里有五十人，他们吃得撑肠拄腹，直到恶心，现在渴望回到自己家园的熟悉环境，有的渴望回去履行职责，有的渴望回去做交易，有的渴望继续工作。但很多人被小树林的负责人拦住，被问及他们要欢宴几天，是否还和彼得、保罗同坐席，并告知，还没有进行完就离开是他们的耻辱，因为这样做很不体面。但他们大多数人回答说：“我们受够了自己的喜乐，食物于我们如同嚼腊，我们的味觉枯干了，以至于一看到这些食物我们就反胃，再也咽不下去了。我们已度过数个奢华的日日夜夜，现在恳求放我们出去。”一得到许可，他们就上气不接下气地飞奔回家。<br />这事过后，天人将这组人召集起来，在路上教导他们有关天堂的事，内容如下：“天堂和尘世一样，也有吃有喝，宴请和聚会。筵席上摆着最上等的珍馐美味，从而使他们的灵惬意畅快。也有游戏和文艺演出，还有音乐会和歌唱会，所有这些都是最完美的。此外，这类事对天人来说是喜乐，但不是幸福。幸福必在喜乐中，因而出自它们。正是喜乐中的幸福使得喜乐成为喜乐，充实并维持它们，以免它们变得一文不值，索然无味。人皆通过自己工作中的用得到这种幸福。<br />每位天人的意之情中都隐藏着一种倾向，它吸引天人的心智去做事。心智以此令自己平静和满足。这种满足和平静的感觉会使心智乐于从主接受用之爱。天堂的幸福是接受此爱的结果，这就是给予生命喜乐（如前所述）的东西。天堂食物本质上无非是爱、智慧，以及它们相结合的用，即用通过智慧出于爱。由于这个原因，天堂的每个人为身体所得到的食物，取决于他发挥的作用；发挥的作用最大，食物最精致；发挥的作用中等，食物中等，但也很美味；发挥的作用低等，食物就低等；懒人则没有食物。”</p>

735. 此后, 天人转向持有以下观点的人, 即天堂喜乐与永恒幸福就是和亚伯拉罕, 以撒, 雅各一同坐席, 然后是节日游戏和娱乐, 随之又是盛宴, 如此持续到永远, 对他们说: “跟我来, 我会带你们进入你们的喜乐所给予的欢乐享受中。 ”于是, 他领他们穿过一片小树林, 来到一块铺着木板的空地上, 那里已摆好桌子, 两边各有十五张。 他们问为何有这么多桌子, 天人回答说: “第一张桌子是亚伯拉罕的, 第二张是以撒的, 第三张是雅各的, 然后依次排列的桌子是十二使徒的; 对面的十五张是他们妻子的, 头三张是给亚伯拉罕的妻子撒拉, 以撒的妻子利百加, 以及雅各的妻子利亚与拉结的, 剩下的十二张是给十二使徒妻子的。 ”<p>过了一会儿, 就看到所有桌子上摆满了菜肴, 空档处还点缀了糖果小金字塔。 客人们站在桌子周围, 等候翘望主持的人。 稍后, 他们来了, 按着从亚伯拉罕到最后一位使徒的顺序鱼贯而入, 各自马上来到自己的桌前, 坐在沙发的一头, 然后邀请周围站着的人: “你们也请入坐吧。 ”于是, 男人便与族长同坐, 女人则与他们的妻子同坐, 他们开怀畅饮, 尽情吃喝。 餐毕, 族长们出去, 然后游戏开始了, 少男少女们则翩翩起舞, 再后是文艺演出。 这些活动结束后, 他们又被邀赴宴, 但规则是, 第一天他们要与亚伯拉罕同吃喝, 第二天与以撒, 第三天与雅各, 第四天与彼得, 第五天与雅各, 第六天与约翰, 第七天与保罗, 依次类推, 直到第十五天, 此后再按同样顺序重新赴宴, 仅仅改变地方, 如此反复, 直到永远。 <p>然后, 天人将这组人召集起来, 对他们说: “你们看到的所有坐席者, 在思想天堂喜乐与永恒幸福时, 和你们幻想得一样。 为了让他们亲自认清自己的想法何等虚荣, 并从中退离, 蒙主允许安排了这些宴会和表演。 你们看到的坐首席者, 只不过是假扮的古人; 他们大多数人是蓄着胡须的乡野村夫, 因有点小财就得意忘形, 幻想他们是古时的族长。 请随我离开这个练习场。 ”<p>于是, 他们就跟着他, 看到这里有五十人, 那里有五十人, 他们吃得撑肠拄腹, 直到恶心, 现在渴望回到自己家园的熟悉环境, 有的渴望回去履行职责, 有的渴望回去做交易, 有的渴望继续工作。 但很多人被小树林的负责人拦住, 被问及他们要欢宴几天, 是否还和彼得, 保罗同坐席, 并告知, 还没有进行完就离开是他们的耻辱, 因为这样做很不体面。 但他们大多数人回答说: “我们受够了自己的喜乐, 食物于我们如同嚼腊, 我们的味觉枯干了, 以至于一看到这些食物我们就反胃, 再也咽不下去了。 我们已度过数个奢华的日日夜夜, 现在恳求放我们出去。 ”一得到许可, 他们就上气不接下气地飞奔回家。 <p>这事过后, 天人将这组人召集起来, 在路上教导他们有关天堂的事, 内容如下: “天堂和尘世一样, 也有吃有喝, 宴请和聚会。 筵席上摆着最上等的珍馐美味, 从而使他们的灵惬意畅快。 也有游戏和文艺演出, 还有音乐会和歌唱会, 所有这些都是最完美的。 此外, 这类事对天人来说是喜乐, 但不是幸福。 幸福必在喜乐中, 因而出自它们。 正是喜乐中的幸福使得喜乐成为喜乐, 充实并维持它们, 以免它们变得一文不值, 索然无味。 人皆通过自己工作中的用得到这种幸福。 <p>每位天人的意之情中都隐藏着一种倾向, 它吸引天人的心智去做事。 心智以此令自己平静和满足。 这种满足和平静的感觉会使心智乐于从主接受用之爱。 天堂的幸福是接受此爱的结果, 这就是给予生命喜乐 (如前所述) 的东西。 天堂食物本质上无非是爱, 智慧, 以及它们相结合的用, 即用通过智慧出于爱。 由于这个原因, 天堂的每个人为身体所得到的食物, 取决于他发挥的作用; 发挥的作用最大, 食物最精致; 发挥的作用中等, 食物中等, 但也很美味; 发挥的作用低等, 食物就低等; 懒人则没有食物。 ” </p>

<p>
735. Afterward the angel addressed the people who had convinced themselves that heavenly joys and eternal happiness consist in dining with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and then playing games and watching shows after the meal, then having another feast the next day, and so on to eternity.
<p>"Follow me," the angel said to them, "and I will bring you into the happiness of your joys. "
<p>He led them through a wooded area to a clearing with a large, low platform of wooden boards that had tables on it - fifteen on one side, and fifteen on the other.
<p>"Why are there so many tables?" they asked.
<p>"The first table is for Abram, the second for Isaac, the third for Jacob, and next to them is a row of twelve tables for the twelve apostles. On the other side, there are the same number of tables for their wives. The first three tables are for Sarai, Abram's wife; Rebecca, Isaac's wife; and Leah and Rachel, Jacob's wives. The other twelve tables are for the wives of the twelve apostles. "
</p>
<p>
[2] Not too long afterward, the tables were loaded with dishes of food, and little pyramids with desserts were neatly placed in the spaces between the dishes. The dinner guests stood next to the tables, excited to see the distinguished people who would be sitting at the heads of the tables. After a brief delay, they saw their honorable dinner companions entering in a procession, beginning with Abram and ending with the last of the apostles. Soon the patriarchs were seated on padded chairs at the heads of the tables. They addressed the visitors, who were still standing, and said, "We invite you to sit down with us. "
<p>The men sat down with the patriarchs and the women sat down with their wives. They all ate and drank together in a joyful yet reverent state of mind. After the meal was over, the famous figures left. Then there were games to play, and young men and women giving a dance performance, and afterward several stage plays. At the end of the evening, all were invited to another festival the next day, but with the following stipulation: "You will dine with Abram on the first day, Isaac on the second, Jacob on the third, Peter on the fourth, James on the fifth, John on the sixth, Paul on the seventh, and with the rest in sequence up to the fifteenth day, at which time the dinner cycle will repeat, although you will be sitting in different places. This cycle will go on forever. "
</p>
<p>
[3] At that point the angel called together the people from his group, and said to them, "All the other guests you dined with were people who had formed similar mental images as your own about the joys of heaven and therefore eternal happiness. These banquets and shows were established with the Lord's permission for the purpose of allowing people to see that their ideas are foolish so that they can let go of them.
<p>"The famous men that you saw at the heads of the tables were actually older actors with beards; many of them are country folk whose relative wealth compared to their neighbors has given them enough of a superior attitude for the part. They agreed to pretend that they were the ancient patriarchs.
</p>
<p>
[4] But follow me now to the pathways that lead out of this arena. "
<p>They followed, and came upon fifty people here and fifty there who had crammed their stomachs full of food to the point of nausea and were longing for their usual routine at home - some for their professional duties, some for their businesses, and some for the work they did with their hands. Many of them, though, had been detained by the guards of that wooded area and questioned about which day of feasting they were on, and whether they had eaten with Peter or Paul yet. They were told that leaving before doing so was highly improper and would cause them great shame.
<p>Many of the people said to the guards in response, "We are fed up with our joys! We can't even taste the food or the drink any more - our sense of taste is burned out. Our stomach can't take it any more, and we can no longer stand to put anything in our mouths. This ridiculous indulgence has gone on for whole days and nights on end. Please, we beg you, let us go!"
<p>They were allowed out and ran home breathlessly.
</p>
<p>
[5] The angel called his group together again, and as they walked away together he taught them the following things about heaven.
<p>"In heaven as on earth there is food and drink, and there are dinners and parties, and the tables of leading figures are laden with glorious spreads including special delicacies you don't find elsewhere; these things rejuvenate and refresh the mind. There are also sports and shows and concerts of vocal and instrumental music, all at the height of perfection. All these things are a joy to the angels, but they don't constitute their true happiness. Their happiness has to be present for these things to bring them joy. The happiness that is present within them during the joyful events is what makes the events joyful, enriches them, and keeps them from becoming meaningless and tedious. And the only source of anyone's true happiness is doing something useful through his or her work.
</p>
<p>
[6] "Hidden deep within the desires of every angel's heart there is a kind of current that draws her or his mind to do something. In that activity the mind finds its peace and satisfaction. This peace and satisfaction then condition the mind to be receptive to the love of being useful that flows in from the Lord. Receiving this love leads to the true heavenly happiness that gives life to the joys that I mentioned a moment ago.
<p>"At the level of its essence, heavenly food is in fact love, wisdom, and usefulness working together; or to put it another way, usefulness that draws on wisdom and comes from love. For all of us in heaven, the type of food we are given for our bodies therefore depends on how useful a function we perform. People who perform the highest-level functions are given magnificent food; people who perform mid-level functions are given more moderate kinds of food, but still very good-tasting; people who perform low-level functions are given humble food. Those who do nothing get no food at all. " </p>

<p>
735. After this the angel addressed those who had formed the notion that the joys of heaven and everlasting happiness meant feasting with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and after the feast games and entertainments, followed by more feasts, and so on for ever. 'Follow me,' he told them, 'and I shall bring you to the enjoyment of the happiness your joys give.' So he led them through a wood to a clearing paved with planks, where tables were set out, fifteen on one side and fifteen on the other.<p>'Why are there so many tables?' they asked. The angel replied that the first table was Abraham's, the second Isaac's, the third Jacob's, and then ranged next to these the tables of the twelve Apostles. On the other side were the same number of tables for their wives, the first three for Sarah, the wife of Abraham, Rebecca, the wife of Isaac, and Leah and Rachel, Jacob's wives. The other twelve were for the wives of the twelve Apostles.</p>
<p>
[2] After a little while all the tables appeared full of dishes of food, and the small spaces between them were decorated with small pyramids of sweets. The diners stood around the tables waiting to see the people who would preside; and after a short interval these were seen entering in procession with Abraham at their head and the rear brought up by the last of the Apostles. Then each went to his own table and sat down on the couch at its head, from where they invited those standing around: 'Do you too please take your seats with us.' So the men sat at table with the patriarchs, and the women with their wives, and they ate and drank cheerfully and with reverence. After the lunch the patriarchs went out, and then the games began, dancing by young girls and young men, and then theatrical performances. When these were over, they were invited to feast again, but the rule was that the first day they should dine with Abraham, the second with Isaac, the third with Jacob, the fourth with Peter, the fifth with James, the sixth with John, the seventh with Paul, and so on with the rest up to the fifteenth day, after which they would go through all the feasts again, merely changing places, and so on for ever.</p>
<p>
[3] After this the angel called together the men in the group and said to them: 'All these whom you have seen at table had much the same thoughts as you did when they imagined the joys of heaven and everlasting happiness. In order that they should see for themselves how vain their notions were, these feasts and performances were set up with the Lord's permission. The leading figures you saw at the head of each table were old men portrayed by actors, many of them countryfolk who had beards, and as the result of some degree of wealth more haughty than the rest; these were made to imagine that they were the ancient patriarchs. But follow me to the exits from this exercise-ground.'</p>
<p>
[4] So they followed him and came upon fifty people in one place and fifty more in another, who had stuffed their bellies with food until they felt sick. Then they longed to return to the familiar surroundings of their homes, some to their duties, some to their businesses, and some to their tasks. But many of them were stopped by the guards of the wood, and questioned about the days they had spent feasting, and whether they had yet eaten at the tables with Peter and Paul, telling them that if they left before this, it would make them ashamed to be so impolite. But most of them answered: 'We have had enough of our joys. The food has become tasteless to us, our taste has become parched, so that our stomachs loathe food and we can no longer bear to swallow it. We have spent a number of long days and nights amid that luxury; we beg you earnestly to let us go.' When they were allowed out, they hurried off home so fast they were out of breath.</p>
<p>
[5] After this the angel called the men of the group together, and as they walked gave them the following information about heaven: 'In heaven, just as in the world, there is food and drink, and there are banquets and parties. The leading people there have their tables laden with rich feasts, dainties and delicacies, which serve to cheer and refresh their minds. There are also games and theatrical performances; there are also concerts and singing, and all achieve the highest perfection. Such things are a joy to them, but they do not constitute happiness. Happiness has to have joys and therefore comes from joys.<p>It is the happiness in joys that makes them joys, enriches them, and keeps them from becoming worthless and boring. Everyone gets this happiness by being of service in his occupation.</p>
<p>
[6] 'Every angel has some hidden tendency in the affection of his will, which induces his mind to do something. By this means the mind calms and satisfies itself. This feeling of satisfaction and calm render the state of the mind amenable to receiving from the Lord the love of service. Heavenly happiness is the result of receiving this, and this is what gives life to the joys I mentioned before. Heavenly food is essentially nothing but love, wisdom and service all combined; that is, service performed by means of wisdom out of love. Everyone therefore in heaven gets food for the body depending on the service he performs; it is magnificent for those who perform the highest services, moderate but of exquisite flavour for those whose service is modest, humble for those who perform humble services. But there is none at all for the lazy.' </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #735 (Ager, 1970)

<p>
735. After this the angel addressed those who had adopted the idea that the joys of heaven and eternal happiness are feastings with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, followed by games and spectacles, and then feasting again, and so on to eternity. And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will introduce you into the felicities of your joys." And he led them through a meadow to a plain staked out, and on it tables were placed, fifteen on each side. <p>They asked why there were so many tables; the angel replied, "The first table is Abraham's, the second Isaac's, the third Jacob's and near them in order are the tables of the twelve apostles; on the other side is the same number of tables for their wives; the three first being for Sarah, Abraham's wife, Rebecca, Isaac's wife, and Leah and Rachel, Jacob's wives; the twelve remaining tables are for the wives of the twelve apostles."
</p>
<p>
[2] After a little delay, all the tables were seen to be loaded with dishes, and the spaces between decorated with little pyramids of sweetmeats. The guests stood around the tables waiting to see those who were to preside. These, after a little waiting, appeared, entering in order of procession from Abraham to the last of the apostles; and each going at once to his own table, took his place upon a couch at the head of it. Then they said to those standing around, "Sit you down with us." And the men sat down with those fathers, and the women with their wives, and ate and drank in gladness and with reverence. <p>After the meal the fathers went out; and then sports were introduced, dances by maidens and young men, and afterward spectacles; and when these were ended the guests were again invited to the feasting, but with the understanding that on the first day they should eat with Abraham, on the second with Isaac, on the third with Jacob, on the fourth with Peter, on the fifth with James, on the sixth with John, on the seventh with Paul, and with all the rest in order until the fifteenth day, when they were to renew the feasting again in the same order; changing seats; and so on to eternity.
</p>
<p>
[3] After this the angel called together the men of his company and said to them, "All those whom you see at the tables had the same imaginary thought about the joys of heaven and its eternal happiness that you had; and these feasting scenes were instituted and permitted by the Lord in order that they might see the vanity of their ideas and be led away from them. Those chief men whom you saw at the head of the tables merely impersonated old men; most of them are rustics with beards, and puffed up by some little wealth, upon whom has been induced the fantasy that they actually were those ancient fathers. But follow me to the ways of exit from this camp."
</p>
<p>
[4] They followed him; and they saw fifty here and fifty there who had loaded their stomachs with food until they were nauseated, and longed to return to the familiar scenes of their own homes, some to their offices, some to their business, and some to their trades. But many were detained by the keepers of the grove, and were asked how many days they had feasted, and whether they had yet eaten at the tables with Peter and Paul, and were told that it would be shameful for them to go away before doing so, because it would be unbecoming. But most of them answered, "We are surfeited with our joys, the food has become insipid to us, our taste has dried up, our stomachs loathe these things, we cannot bear these drinks, we have spent several days and nights in this luxury, and we earnestly beg to be let out." And being let out, with panting breath and hurried steps they fled home.
</p>
<p>
[5] Then the angel called the men of his company, and on the way taught them about heaven, as follows: "In heaven, just as in the world, there are food and drink, feasts and convivial parties, on the tables of the great are the choicest foods, rarities, and delicacies, whereby their spirits are exhilarated and refreshed; there are also plays and exhibitions, and instrumental and vocal music; and all in the highest perfection. Moreover, such things are joys to those in heaven, but not happiness; happiness must be in the joys, and thus from them. It is happiness in the joys that causes them to be joys, enriches them, and so sustains them as to prevent their becoming paltry and wearisome; and this happiness every man has from use in his employment.
</p>
<p>
[6] "In the affection of every angel's will there is a kind of hidden current that draws his mind to the doing of something, wherein the mind finds tranquillity and satisfaction; and this satisfaction and tranquillity produce a state of mind receptive of the love of use from the Lord; and from the reception of this love comes heavenly happiness, which is the life of those joys that have been enumerated. Heavenly food in its essence is no other than love, wisdom, and use together; that is, use from love through wisdom; and because of this to everyone in heaven food for the body is given according to the use he performs, most excellent food to those who are eminently useful; food of medium quality but of exquisite taste to those whose use is of the middle grade; inferior food to those who perform low uses; but none to the indolent." </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #735 (Dick, 1950)

<p>
735. The angel then addressed those who had conceived the idea that the joys of heaven and eternal happiness consisted in an eternal succession of feasts with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, alternating with sports and stage plays. He said to them: "Follow me, and I will bring you to that happy state that attends the gratification of your joys." He led them through a grove to a level field covered over with a wooden floor, where were set tables, fifteen on one side and fifteen on the other. They asked why there were so many tables; and the angel replied: "The first table is for Abraham, the second for Isaac, the third for Jacob, and near these in due order are tables for the twelve apostles. On the other side are the same number of tables for their wives. The first three are for Sarah the wife of Abraham, Rebecca the wife of Isaac, and Leah and Rachel the wives of Jacob; and the other twelve are for the wives of the twelve apostles."</p>
<p>
[2] Presently all the tables appeared laden with dishes of food, interspersed with table ornaments bearing fruits and condiments. The guests stood round the tables, waiting to see those who were to preside. After a brief interval, they were seen to enter in processional order, from Abraham to the last of the apostles. They now approached their own table, and reclined at the head of the couch; and then they invited those who were standing around to take their places. The men reclined with the patriarchs and apostles, and the women with their wives; and they ate and drank with reverent joy. When the repast was ended, the patriarchs retired; and then were introduced sports and dances of maidens and young men, and these were succeeded by plays. Thereupon they were again invited to feast according to the following arrangement: on the first day they were to eat with Abraham, on the next with Isaac, on the third with Jacob, on the fourth with Peter, on the fifth with James, on the sixth with John, on the seventh with Paul, and with the rest in order till the fifteenth day, when they were to begin the feasting over again in the same order, changing their seats each time, and so on to eternity.</p>
<p>
[3] Some time after, the angel called together the men of his company, and said to them: "All those whom you saw at the tables had entertained in their imagination the same ideas as you concerning the joys of heaven, and the eternal happiness that follows from these; and in order that they might realize the vanity of their ideas, and be led away from them, such festive scenes, which are merely dramatic representations, have been instituted by Divine permission. Those leading personages whom you saw at the head of the tables, were old men playing their part. They were mostly from the peasant class, who, wearing long beards and puffed up with pride at possessing a little more wealth than others, were obsessed with the delusion that they were those old patriarchs. But follow me to the paths that lead away from this place of festivity."</p>
<p>
[4] So they followed him and saw groups of fifty here and fifty there who had surfeited themselves with food till they were nauseated. They longed to return to the affairs of their own households, some to their official duties, some to their businesses, and some to their manual labor. Many, however, were detained by the wardens of the grove who questioned them as to the number of days they had feasted, and whether they had yet eaten at the tables with Peter and Paul; and they were told that if they went away before doing so, it would be to their lasting shame, because it was a disgraceful thing to do. Most of them replied: "We have tasted our joys to the full; the food has become insipid to us; and our relish for it has been destroyed. Our stomachs revolt at it, and we cannot bear even to taste it. We have already spent several days and nights in that luxury, and we earnestly beg to be let out." They were then let out; and with panting breath and hurried steps they fled home.</p>
<p>
[5] The angel afterwards called together his companions, and as they went along, he gave them the following instruction concerning heaven. "There are in heaven, as well as in the world, food and drink, feasts and repasts. For leading personages the tables furnished with richest food, delicate and splendid, by which their minds are exhilarated and refreshed. There are sports and stage shows, instrumental music and song, and all in the highest perfection. Such things are pleasures to those for whom they are provided, but not happiness; which indeed will be found in pleasures, and which springs from them. When it is present in them it causes them to be real pleasures, enriching and elevating them, and preventing them from degenerating and becoming distasteful but happiness comes to every one from the use he performs in his own vocation.</p>
<p>
[6] "There is in the affection of the will of every angel a latent tendency which induces the mind to do something; and this tranquilizes and satisfies it. Satisfaction and tranquillity create a state of mind receptive of the love of use from the Lord; and it is from the reception of this love that heavenly happiness results, which is the very life of those pleasures already referred to. Heavenly food in its essence is the harmonious union of love, wisdom and use; that is, use from love through the exercise of wisdom. For this reason food for the body is given to every one in heaven according to the use which he performs, sumptuous to those who perform uses of an outstanding character, moderately fine but of choice flavor to those whose uses are of moderate importance, and plain to those who perform humble uses of lesser importance; but none to the indolent." </p>

Post haec Angelus alloquutus est illos, qui induxerant sibi ideam de Gaudiis Coeli, et de Felicitate aeterna, quod forent Epulationes cum Abramo, Isaco et Jacobo; et post epulas Ludi et Spectacula, ac iterum Epulae, et sic in aeternum: et dixit illis, sequimini me, et introducam vos in gaudiorum vestrorum felicitates; et introduxit illos per nemus in planitiem stratam asseribus, super qua positae erant Mensae, quindecim ab uno latere, et quindecim ab altero; et quaesiverunt, cur tot mensae, et respondit Angelus, quod prima mensa sit Abrami, secunda Isaci, tertia Jacobi, et juxta has in serie mensae duodecim Apostolorum; ab altero latere totidem mensae Uxorum illorum, et tres primae mensae sunt Sarae uxoris Abrami, Rebeccae uxoris Isaci, ac Leae et Rachelis uxorum Jacobi; ac duodecim reliquae sunt uxorum duodecim Apostolorum.</p>
<p>
[2] Post aliquam moram, apparebant omnes Mensae plenae ferculis, et spatiola inter haec ornata parvis pyramidibus cum condituris. Epulaturi stabant circum illas in exspectatione videndi Praesules mensarum; qui pauculum exspectati visi sunt in ordine processionis ab Abramo ad ultimum Apostolorum intrantes; et mox quisque ad suam mensam accedens se reposuit super toro ad caput ejus; et inde dixerunt ad circumstantes, discumbite etiam vos nobiscum; et discubuerunt viri cum Patribus illis, et foeminae cum Uxoribus illorum, et comederunt et biberunt in laetitia, et cum veneratione. Post prandium exiverunt <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
illi Patres; et tunc instituti sunt ludi, choreae virginum et juvenum, et post has spectacula: quibus finitis invitabantur iterum ad Epulas, sed cum statuto, quod primo die comederent cum Abramo, altero cum Isaco, tertio cum Jacobo, quarto cum Petro, quinto cum Jacobo, sexto cum Johanne, septimo cum Paulo, et cum reliquis in ordine usque ad quindecimum diem, a quo iterum in simili ordine commessationes renovarent variando sedes, et sic in aeternum.</p>
<p>
[3] Post haec Angelus convocavit viros cohortis, et dixit illis, hi omnes, quos vidistis ad mensas, in simili cogitatione imaginaria de Gaudiis Coeli, et inde Felicitate aeterna cum vobis fuerant; et propter finem, ut ipsi videant vanitates idearum suarum, et ab illis abducantur, institutae sunt, et a Domino permissae tales epulares Scenae. Primores illi, quos vidistis ad capita mensarum, erant personati <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
Senes, plerique ex rustica gente, qui barbati, et ex quadam opulentia prae caeteris fastuosi, quibus inducta est phantasia, quod vetusti illi Patres essent.</p>
<p>
[4] Sed sequimini me in vias exitus e palaestra hac, et sequuti sunt, et videbant quinquaginta hic et quinquaginta ibi, qui farciverant ventres cibariis usque ad nauseas, et concupiverunt redire ad familiaria domuum suarum, quidam ad sua munia, quidam ad sua negotia, et quidam ad suas operas: at multi a custodibus nemoris retenti et interrogati de diebus epulationis illorum, et num adhuc ad mensas cum Petro et cum Paulo comederint, et si prius exirent, hoc, quia, indecens est, futurum illis pudori: sed plerique respondebant, explevimus gaudia nostra, cibi facti sunt nobis insipidi, ac gustus torridus, fastidit illos stomachus, non sustinemus libare illos, protraximus aliquot dies et noctes in luxurie illa, impense rogamus ut emittamur; ac dimissi, anhelo spiritu et festino cursu aufugerunt domum.</p>
<p>
[5] Post haec Angelus vocavit viros cohortis, et in via docuit illos haec de Coelo: in Coelo aeque sicut in Mundo sunt Cibi et Potus, sunt Commessationes et Convivia; et apud Primores ibi sunt Mensae super quibus sunt opimae dapes, cupediae et lautitiae, quibus exhilarantur et recreantur animi; et sunt quoque Ludi et Spectacula; et sunt Musicalia et Cantica; et omnia illa in summa perfectione; talia sunt illis etiam in gaudia, sed non in felicitatem; haec erit in gaudiis, et inde ex gaudiis; felicitas in gaudiis facit ut sint gaudia, opimat illa, et sustentat ne vilescant et fastidiantur; et haec felicitas est cuivis ex usu in sua functione.</p>
<p>
[6] Est aliqua vena in affectione voluntatis cujusvis Angeli latens, quae attrahit mentem ad aliquid faciendum; mens per hoc tranquillat se, et satisfacit sibi; haec satisfactio <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
et illa tranquillitas faciunt statum mentis receptibilem amoris usus a Domino; ex receptione hujus est Felicitas coelestis, quae est vita illorum gaudiorum, quae prius memorata sunt. Cibus coelestis in sua essentia nec aliud est quam amor, sapientia et usus simul, hoc est, usus per sapientiam ex amore; quamobrem unicuivis in Coelo datur cibus pro corpore secundum usum, quem praestat, magnificus illis qui in eminente usu sunt, modicus sed exquisiti saporis illis qui in medii gradus usu sunt, et vilis illis qui in vili usu sunt, at nullus socordibus.<p>
