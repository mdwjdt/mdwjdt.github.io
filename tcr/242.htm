<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第242节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>242</b>.天使自己声称，他们的一切智慧都是从圣言获得的，因为他们所享有的光取决于他们对圣言的理解程度。天上的光就是圣智，圣智在他们眼里显为光。在保存圣言复本的圣所中，这光如同火焰一般，光辉明亮，其强度超过圣所外任何天堂之光。属天天使的智慧超出属灵天使智慧的程度，和属灵天使超出世人智慧的程度差不多。这是因为属天天使拥有来自主的爱之善，而属灵天使拥有来自主的智之真。爱之善所在之处就是智慧所居之处；而真理所在之处，除了与那里的爱之善等量的智慧外，却不是智慧所居之处。这就是为何圣言在主的属天国度的写作方式不同于在主的属灵国度的。因为属天国度的圣言表达的是爱之善，标志是爱的情感；而属灵国度的圣言表达的是智之真，标志是对真理的内在觉察。由此可以推论出我们世人所拥有的圣言隐藏着何种智慧。因为无法形容的一切天使智慧就藏在其中，人若藉由圣言被主变成天使，死后就会进入那智慧中。</p>

242. 天人坦白承認, 他們從聖言中獲取一切的智慧; 因為他們領悟
<p>聖言的程度如何, 就處在什麼樣的亮光當中。天國之光就是神性的
<p>智慧, 顯于天人的眼前。聖所之中若擺放著聖言, 其中的光芒如同火焰熊熊輝煌明亮, 其強度超出聖所之外的任何光亮。
<p>屬天天人的智慧超過屬靈天人, 其程度差不多類似于屬靈天人的智慧超過世人的智慧。這是因為屬天天人擁有源自主的良善(仁之善), 而屬靈天人擁有的是源自主的真理(智之理)。哪裡有仁之善, 哪裡就有智慧居於其間。然而並非哪裡有真理, 哪裡就有智慧居於其間, 除非那裡也有仁之善。這就是為何主的屬天天國中的聖言, 與屬靈天國的書寫方式截然不同。因為屬天國度的聖言表達的是仁之善, 其中的記號表示對仁愛的情感; 而屬靈國度的聖言表達的是智之理, 其中的記號表示對真理的內在感知。
<p>由此可得結論, 世上聖言之中深藏著何等的智慧, 因為在其中隱藏著難以言表的所有天人的智慧。人若被主藉著聖言變成天人, 死後會到達這樣的智慧。 </p>

242. On the point that the angels receive all their wisdom from the Word, they themselves assert this. They have as much light as they have understanding of the Word. Heaven's light is divine wisdom; before angels' eyes this divine wisdom takes the form of light.
<p>In the sanctuaries where their copies of the Word are kept, the light is fiery or shining white. There is more light in such places than anywhere else in heaven.
<p>The wisdom of heavenly angels goes almost as far beyond the wisdom of spiritual angels as the wisdom of spiritual angels goes beyond our human wisdom. The reason for this is that heavenly angels have a love from the Lord for what is good, while spiritual angels have wisdom from the Lord about what is true. Where love for what is good exists, there dwells wisdom also. Where truths exist, there dwells only as much wisdom as there is love for what is good. This is why the Word is written one way in the Lord's heavenly kingdom and another in his spiritual kingdom. The heavenly kingdoms form of the Word expresses loving forms of goodness in letters and conveys the specific types of love with diacritical marks. The spiritual kingdoms form of the Word expresses truths of wisdom in letters and conveys inner perceptions of truth with diacritical marks.
<p>From all this you can imagine what kind of wisdom lies hidden in the Word that we have in this world. Inside it there lies all angelic wisdom, which is inexpressible. If we are made angels by the Lord through the Word, we will come into that wisdom after death. </p>

242. The angels themselves declare that all their wisdom comes through the Word; for the light they enjoy depends upon how deep is their understanding of the Word. The light of heaven is Divine wisdom, which is visible to their eyes as light. In the shrine where a copy of the Word is stored, the light is flame-like and brilliant, surpassing in intensity any light in heaven outside it. The wisdom of the celestial angels exceeds that of the spiritual angels, more or less to the same extent as that exceeds that of human beings. This is because the celestial angels have the good of love from the Lord, and the spiritual angels have the truths of wisdom from the Lord. Where the good of love is, there too dwells wisdom; but where truths are, wisdom does not dwell except to the extent that the good of love is there too. This is why the Word is written differently in the Lord's celestial kingdom from that in His spiritual kingdom. For in the Word of the celestial kingdom the expressions convey the different kinds of good of love and the characters the affections of love; in the Word of the spiritual kingdom the expressions convey the truths of wisdom, the characters the inward perceptions of truth. These facts will allow one to conclude what wisdom there is lurking hidden in the Word we have in the world. For in it lies hidden all the wisdom of the angels, which is beyond description; and a person after death enters into possession of this wisdom, if by means of the Word he is made an angel by the Lord. </p>

242. That the angels gain all their wisdom through the Word they themselves confess; for so far as they are in the understanding of the Word, so far they are in light. The light of heaven is the Divine wisdom, and this to angelic eyes is light. In the sacred repository where a copy of the Word is kept, the light is flame-like and brilliant, surpassing every degree of light in heaven outside of that repository. The wisdom of the celestial angels surpasses the wisdom of the spiritual angels almost as much as the wisdom of the latter surpasses that of men; and this because the celestial angels are in good of love from the Lord, and the spiritual angels are in truths of wisdom from the Lord; and where the good of love is there wisdom abides also; but where truths are, only so much of wisdom abides as there is also good of love. This is the reason why the Word in the Lord's celestial kingdom is written differently from the Word in His spiritual kingdom; for in the Word of the celestial kingdom goods of love are expressed, and the marks are affections of the love; while in the Word of the spiritual kingdom truths of wisdom are expressed, and the marks are interior perceptions of truth. From all this one may conclude what kind of wisdom lies concealed in the Word which is in the world; for in it all angelic wisdom, which is ineffable, is concealed; and the man, who from the Lord through the Word becomes an angel, enters into that wisdom after death. </p>

242. The angels themselves confess that they derive all their wisdom from the Word, for the light in which they are varies with their understanding of the Word, light with them being Divine Wisdom, which is the light of heaven. In the sacred repository, where the copy of the Word is kept, the light is flaming and bright, surpassing every degree of light in heaven outside. The wisdom of celestial angels surpasses that of spiritual angels almost as much as the wisdom of spiritual angels surpasses that of men, because celestial angels are in the good of love from the Lord, and spiritual angels are in the truths of wisdom from the Lord; and where the good of love is, there is wisdom also; but where truths are, there is no more wisdom than there is also good of love. This is the reason why the Word in the Lord's celestial kingdom is written differently from the Word in His spiritual kingdom. For in the Word of the celestial kingdom are expressed the goods of love, and the signs indicate the affections of love; while in the Word of the spiritual kingdom are expressed the truths of wisdom, and the signs indicate the interior perceptions of truth. From this we may conclude what wisdom lies concealed in the Word which is in this world; for within it lies all angelic wisdom, and this is ineffable. Into this wisdom after death the man comes whom the Lord makes an angel through the Word. </p>

242. Quod omnis sapientia sit Angelis per Verbum, hoc fatentur ipsi, nam quantum in Verbi intellectu sunt, tantum in luce sunt; Lux Coeli est Divina Sapientia, quae coram oculis eorum est Lux. In Sacrario, in quo <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Exemplar repositum est, est Lux flammea et candida, excedens omnem gradum lucis, quae extra illud in Coelo est. Sapientia Angelorum Coelestium excedit Sapientiam Angelorum spiritualium, paene sicut sapientia horum Angelorum excedit sapientiam hominum; et hoc ex causa, quia Angeli coelestes in bono amoris a Domino sunt, et Angeli spirituales in veris sapientiae a Domino sunt; et ubi bonum amoris est, ibi residet sapientia simul; at ubi vera sunt, ibi non residet plus sapientiae, quam quantum simul bonum amoris. Haec causa est, quod Verbum in Regno Coelesti Domini aliter scriptum sit quam in Regno Spirituali Ipsius; nam in Verbo Regni coelestis sunt expressa bona amoris, et signa sunt affectiones amoris, at in Verbo Regni spiritualis sunt expressa vera sapientiae, et signa sunt perceptiones interiores veri. Ex his concludi potest, qualis Sapientia in Verbo, quod in Mundo est, recondita latet; in illo enim latet omnis Sapientia angelica, quae ineffabilis est; et in illam venit homo post mortem, qui a Domino per Verbum angelus fit.<p>
