711. 第3节 若理解了所有这一切, 谁都能领悟到, 圣餐包含了教会和天堂的一切事物, 无论总体还是细节<p>前节说明了, 主自己就在圣餐里面, 肉与饼就是爱之圣善的主, 血与酒则是智之圣真的主。 故, 圣餐包含了三样事物, 主, 圣善, 圣真。 所以, 既然圣餐包含和容纳了这三者, 那么可知, 它也包含和容纳了天堂与教会的共性。 既然一切细节依赖于共性, 如同容物依赖于它们的容器, 那么也可知, 圣餐包含和容纳了天堂与教会的一切细节。 由此证实了第一个事实, 即既然主的肉与血 (饼与酒也一样) 表圣善与圣真, 二者出自主, 且就是主, 那么圣餐包含了教会和天堂的一切事物, 无论总体还是细节。 </p>

711. Understanding What Has Just Been Presented Makes It Possible to See That the Holy Supper Includes All the Qualities of the Church and All the Qualities of Heaven, Both Generally and Specifically
<p>The material under the previous heading showed that the Lord himself is in the Holy Supper, that the divine goodness that comes from his love is the flesh and the bread, and that the divine truth that comes from his wisdom is the blood and the wine. Therefore the Holy Supper has three things within it: the Lord, his divine goodness, and his divine truth. Since these are the three things that the Holy Supper includes and contains, it follows that it contains the characteristics that are found universally throughout all of heaven and the church; and because all the individual qualities depend on these universal characteristics the way contents depend on their context, it also follows that the Holy Supper includes and contains all the individual qualities found in heaven and the church.
<p>Therefore the first conclusion to be drawn from this is that since the Lord's flesh and blood and likewise the bread and wine mean divine goodness and divine truth, each of which comes from the Lord and in fact is the Lord, the Holy Supper contains, then, all the qualities of heaven and all the qualities of the church both generally and specifically. </p>

711. III. By understanding this it is possible to grasp the fact that the Holy Supper contains everything to do with the church and heaven, both at the universal and at the particular level.<p>It was shown in the previous section that the Lord Himself is present in the Holy Supper, and that flesh and bread are the Lord in respect of the Divine good of love, and blood and wine are the Lord in respect of the Divine truth of wisdom. There are therefore three items involved in the Holy Supper, the Lord, His Divine good and His Divine truth. So since the Holy Supper includes and contains these three, it follows that it also includes and contains the universals of heaven and the church. Since all particulars depend upon universals, as contents do on their containers, it also follows that the Holy Supper includes and contains all the particulars of heaven and the church. The first fact established by this is that, since the Lord's flesh and blood, and likewise bread and wine, mean the Divine good and the Divine truth, both coming from the Lord and being the Lord, the Holy Supper contains everything to do with heaven and the church both at the universal and at the particular level. </p>

711. III. WHEN ALL THIS IS UNDERSTOOD ANYONE CAN COMPREHEND THAT THE HOLY SUPPER CONTAINS ALL THINGS OF THE CHURCH AND ALL THINGS OF HEAVEN BOTH IN GENERAL AND IN PARTICULAR. <p>It has been shown in the preceding section that the Lord Himself is in the holy supper, and that flesh and bread <sup "fn11_1">1</sup>
are the Lord in respect to the Divine good of love, and blood and wine are the Lord in respect to the Divine truth of wisdom. Therefore the holy supper involves three things, namely, the Lord, His Divine good, and His Divine truth. Since, therefore, the holy supper includes and contains these three, it follows that it also includes and contains the universals of heaven and the church. And as all particulars depend on universals as contents on their containants, it also follows that the holy supper includes and contains all the particulars of heaven and the church. From all this it is clear, for the first time, that as the Lord's flesh and blood, and in like manner the bread and wine, mean Divine good and Divine truth, both from the Lord and both being the Lord, so the holy supper contains all things of heaven and the church, both in general and in particular. <p>

711. III. FROM AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOVE, ONE MAY PERCEIVE THAT THE HOLY SUPPER CONTAINS, BOTH AS TO UNIVERSALS AND AS TO PARTICULARS, ALL THINGS OF THE CHURCH AND ALL THINGS OF HEAVEN.<p>It was shown in the preceding article, that the Lord Himself is in the Holy Supper, that the flesh and bread are the Lord as to the Divine Good of Love, and that the blood and wine are the Lord as to the Divine Truth of Wisdom. Thus the Holy Supper involves the three universals, namely, the Lord, His Divine Good and His Divine Truth. Since then the Holy Supper includes and contains these three, it follows that it also includes and contains the universals of heaven and of the Church. Because all particulars depend on universals, just as contents depend on containants, it follows also that the Holy Supper includes and contains all the particulars of heaven and of the Church. As the Divine Good and the Divine Truth, both from the Lord and both being the Lord, are meant by His flesh and blood and also by the bread and wine, it is evident as a primary consequence that the Holy Supper contains, both as to universals and as to particulars, all things of heaven and of the Church. </p>

711. Quod ex his intellectis comprehendi possit, quod Sancta Coena universaliter et singulariter contineat omnia Ecclesiae et omnia Coeli.<p>In Articulo praecedente ostensum est, quod in Sancta Coena sit Ipse Dominus, et quod Caro et Panis sint Ipse quoad Divinum Bonum Amoris, et quod Sanguis et Vinum sint Ipse quoad Divinum Verum Sapientiae, quare Tria sunt quae Sancta Coena involvit, nempe Dominum, Divinum Ipsius Bonum et Divinum Ipsius Verum. Cum itaque Sancta Coena haec Tria includit et continet, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
sequitur quod etiam includat et contineat Universalia Coeli et Ecclesiae: et quia omnia singularia ab Universalibus dependent, sicut contenta a suis continentibus, sequitur etiam, quod Sancta Coena includat et contineat omnia singularia Coeli et Ecclesiae. Ex his primum constat, quod quia per Domini Carnem et Sanguinem, et similiter per Panem et Vinum, intelligitur Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum, utrumque a Domino et Dominus, Sancta Coena contineat universaliter et singulariter omnia Coeli et Ecclesiae.<p>
