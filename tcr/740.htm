740. When all that came to an end, a voice was heard from heaven saying to the angel with the trumpet, "Out of all who are gathered there, choose ten and bring them up to us. We have heard from the Lord that he will prepare them in such a way that for three days the heat and light or love and wisdom of our heaven will not bring them harm. "
<p>Ten were chosen to follow the angel. They climbed up along a steep trail to the top of a hill, and then from there up a mountain. The heaven of those angels was on the top of that mountain. From a distance it had previously appeared to them as a kind of expanse in the clouds. The gates were opened for them. After they had passed through the third set of gates, the angel who was bringing them in hurried to the prince [who was the head] of that community, that heaven, and announced their arrival.
<p>The prince said, "Take some of the members of my entourage and inform them that these visitors are here with my permission. Bring them into my outer court. Give them each a suite with a bedroom. Have some of my court attendants and some of my servants minister to the visitors and see to their wants. " This was done.
<p>When the angel was bringing them in, they asked whether it would be allowable for them to meet and visit with the prince of the community. The angel answered, "It is morning now; there will not be a chance before noon. Until then the angels are all performing their functions and doing their work. You are invited to a luncheon, however, and you will be seated at the head table with the prince. In the meantime I will take you into the palace, where you will see some magnificent and astounding things. "
</p>
<p>
[2] When they were brought to the palace they first surveyed it from the outside. It was very large. The main structure was built out of porphyry and was sitting on a foundation made of jasper. In front of the entrance there were six tall pillars made of lapis lazuli. The roof was covered with a layer of gold. The palace had tall windows of completely clear glass, with gilded trim.
<p>Then the ten visitors were led inside the palace and taken from room to room. They saw indescribably beautiful ornamentation there, beneath ceilings decorated with exquisite reliefs. Along the walls there were tables made of a gold and silver alloy; on them were utensils of various kinds made out of precious stones and whole gems shaped into heavenly forms. There was more besides that as well, but they were things that no eyes on earth have ever seen, and therefore there would be no way for people to believe that such things exist in heaven.
</p>
<p>
[3] As the visitors were feeling stunned by the magnificent things they had seen, the angel said, "Don't be surprised. The things you have seen here were not made or crafted by any angelic hand. They were fashioned by the same Artist who made the universe and were given as gifts to the prince of our community. The art of architecture exists in heaven in its highest state. All the principles of architecture on earth come from here.
<p>"Now, you might suppose," the angel added, "that things like this would bewitch our eyes and overwhelm us so that we would think of them as the very joys of our heaven; but in fact our hearts are not set on them. They are just accessories to the joy that is in our hearts. When we contemplate them as accessories and as the handiwork of God, then we behold the divine omnipresence and mercy that are present within them. " </p>

740. When these events had taken place, a voice was heard from heaven, saying to the angel with the trumpet: 'Choose ten out of all the assembly and bring them in to us. We have been told by the Lord that He will prepare them, so that for three days the heat and light, that is, the love and wisdom, of our heaven will not do them any harm.'<p>So ten were chosen, and followed the angel. They went up a hill by a sloping path, and from there on to a mountain, on top of which was the heaven of those angels. Previously seen from a distance it had looked to them like an expanse in the clouds. Gates were opened for them, and when they had passed through the third, the angel conducting them hastened to the prince of that community or heaven, and announced their arrival.<p>'Take some of my retinue,' replied the prince, I and tell our guests that their arrival is welcome to me. Take them into my outer courtyard, and allot each a room with its bedroom. And take some from my court and servants to wait upon them and serve them at their wish.' This was done as had been ordered.<p>When they had been brought in by the angel, they asked whether they might visit the prince and see him. 'It is morning now,' replied the angel, 'and you cannot see him before noon. Until then all are occupied with their duties and work. But you have been invited to lunch, and you will then sit at table with our prince. Meanwhile I shall take you into his palace, to see the splendid and magnificent things in it.'</p>
<p>
[2] When they were brought to the palace, they first of all viewed it from the outside. It was spacious, built of porphyry with foundations of jasper. In front of the gate were six lofty columns of lapis lazuli, the roof was made of gold plates, there were high windows of the most transparent crystal, and the window-frames too were of gold. After seeing the outside, they were allowed inside the palace, and taken on a tour of the rooms; there they saw ornaments of indescribable beauty, and under the ceilings decorations of unrivalled carving. Near the walls tables were placed made of silver alloyed with gold, on which was a variety of equipment decorated with precious stones, and some items made out of solid gems cut into heavenly shapes. There was more, things no eye on earth has ever seen, so that no one could possibly believe that heaven contained such wonders.</p>
<p>
[3] While they were stunned by the magnificence of what they had seen, the angel said: 'Do not be surprised. These things you see were not made or crafted by the hand of any angel. They are the work of the Craftsman of the universe, given as a present to our prince. This therefore is architecture at its highest, and it is from this that all the rules of architecture in the world derive. You may judge,' the angel went on, 'that such things fascinate our eyes and so dazzle them that we think those are the joys of our heaven. But because our hearts are not set on them, they are only extras added to the joys of our hearts. Thus in so far as we look on them as extras, and as God's handiwork, so far do we see in them the omnipotence and mercy of God.' </p>

740. After all these things had taken place a voice was heard from heaven, saying to the angel with the trumpet; "Choose ten men from all those assembled, and introduce them to us; we have heard from the Lord that He will so prepare them that the heat and light, of love and wisdom, of our heaven may be borne by them without harm for three days." <p>Ten men were then chosen and followed the angel. And they went up a steep path to a certain hill, and from this to a mountain on which was the heaven of those angels, which had before appeared to them at a distance like an expanse in the clouds. The gates were opened for them, and when they had passed the third the introducing angel ran to the prince of that society or heaven, and announced their arrival. And the prince said in reply, "Take some of my attendants, and carry back word to them that I am pleased that they have come, and introduce them into my ante-court, and give to each his own room and bed-chamber. Take also some of my courtiers and some servants to wait upon them, and render them any service they may desire." This was done. <p>When they had been admitted by the angel, they asked whether they might be permitted to go and see the prince. The angel replied, "It is now morning, and he cannot be seen before noon; all are still engaged in their own duties and labors. But you are invited to dinner; and then you will sit at the table with our prince; and in the meantime I will conduct you into his palace where you will see magnificent and splendid things."
</p>
<p>
[2] When he had led them to the palace they first viewed it from without. It was spacious, built of porphyry, with a foundation of jasper. Before the doors were six tall columns of lapis lazuli. The roof was made of plates of gold, the high windows were of the clearest crystal, and their frames of gold. They were then led into the interior of the palace, and conducted from room to room; and they saw ornaments of indescribable beauty, and on the ceilings decorations of inimitable carvings. Placed against the walls they saw tables of silver fused with gold, on which were various useful articles made of precious stones and of whole gems in heavenly forms. And more things they saw, which no eye on earth had ever seen, and therefore no one had been able to believe that such things exist in heaven.
</p>
<p>
[3] While they were standing amazed at the sight of such magnificence the angel said, "Do not be astonished; these things that you see are not the work or fabrication of any angelic hand, but were made by the Architect of the universe and bestowed as a gift on our prince, so that architectural art is here in its perfection, and from it come all the rules of art in the world." The angel said further, "You may suppose, perhaps, that such things fascinate our eyes and so far infatuate them that we believe these things to be the joys of our heaven; but they are merely accessory to the joys of our hearts, our hearts not being in them; and so far therefore as we contemplate them as accessory, and as the workmanship of God, we contemplate in them the Divine omnipotence and kindness." </p>

740. At the conclusion of this incident a voice was heard from heaven, saying to the angel with the trumpet, "Select ten out of the assembly and bring them to us. We have heard from the Lord that He will prepare them, so that for three days the heat and light, that is, the love and wisdom of our heaven will do them no harm.<p>Then ten were selected, and they followed the angel. They ascended a steep path up a certain hill; and from this they went up a mountain on whose summit was the heaven of those angels, which had before appeared to them at a distance like an expanse in the clouds. The gates were opened for them; and after they had passed through the third gate, the angel who was introducing them hastened to the prince of the society, that is, of that heaven, and announced their arrival. The prince said: "Take some of my retinue with you and tell your companions that they are welcome. Bring them to my outer court, and provide each with a private apartment and a bedroom. Appoint some of my attendants and servants to wait on them and be at their service." This was done. On being introduced by the angel they asked if they might go and see the prince; but the angel replied: "It is now morning, and he may not be seen before noon. Till that time every one is engaged at his own office and employment; but you are invited to dinner, and then you will sit at table with our prince. In the meantime I will conduct you to his palace, where you will see magnificent and splendid things."</p>
<p>
[2] When they were brought to the palace they first viewed it from without. It was spacious, built of porphyry, with a foundation of jasper; and before the gate were six lofty pillars of colored marble; the roof was of plates of gold, the high windows were of the clearest crystal, and their flames were of gold. Next they were taken inside the palace, and conducted from room to room where they saw ornaments of inexpressible beauty, and matchless carvings decorating the ceilings. Along the walls were placed tables of silver inlaid with gold, on which were set a variety of vessels fashioned from precious stones, some from single stones, in heavenly shapes. There were many things which no eye had ever seen on earth, and so which no one could induce himself to believe existed in heaven.<p>While they stood amazed at the magnificent things they saw, the angel said: "Do not be surprised. The things which you now behold were not made and fashioned by the hand of any angel, but by the Maker of the universe and presented as a gift to our prince. Here, therefore, is architecture in its perfection, from which are derived all the rules of that art in the world." The angel continued: "You may suppose that such things as these charm our eyes and delude us into believing that they constitute the joys of our heaven. But our heart is not in them, for they are only of secondary esteem; and as far as we regard them as secondary, and as the work of God, so far we behold in them the Divine omnipotence and beneficence." </p>

740. His peractis audita est vox e Coelo ad Angelum tubae, elige decem ex omnibus convocatis, et introduc illos ad nos; audivimus a Domino, quod praeparaturus sit illos, ne calor et lux, seu amor et sapientia nostri Coeli, per tres dies inferant illis aliquam noxam; et electi sunt decem, et sequuti Angelum; et ascenderunt per tramitem clivosum in quendam collem, et ab hoc in Montem, super quo erat illorum Angelorum Coelum, quod prius ad distantiam apparuerat illis sicut Expansum in nubibus: et aperiebantur pro illis portae, et postquam transiverunt tertiam, Angelus introductor cucurrit ad Principem Societatis seu Coeli illius, et annuntiavit adventum illorum; et Princeps respondit, assume aliquos ex satellitio meo, et renuntia illis, quod adventus illorum mihi sit acceptus, et introduc illos in Anticuriam meam, et distribue cuivis suum conclave cum suo cubiculo; et ex aulicis meis desume aliquos, et ex famulis qui ministrent illis, et qui serviant illis ad nutus; et factum est ita. At cum introducti sunt ab Angelo, quaesiverunt Numeri liceat adire et videre Principem; et respondit Angelus, est nunc mane, et non licet ante tempus meridiei; sunt omnes eousque in suis officiis et in <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
suis operis; sed invitati estis ad prandium; et tunc ad mensam cum Principe nostro sedebitis: interea introducam vos in illius Palatium, ubi videbitis magnifica et splendida.</p>
<p>
[2] Cum adducti sunt ad Palatium, primum viderunt illud ab extra, erat amplum, structum ex porphyrite, et substructum ex jaspide, <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
et ante portam sex columnae altae ex lapide lazuli, tectum ex laminis auri, fenestrae altae ex pellucidissimo chrystallo, harum postes etiam ex auro. Post hoc, introducti sunt intus in Palatium, et circumducti a conclavi in conclave, et viderunt ornamenta ineffabilis <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
decoris, sub tectis decoramenta coelaturae inimitabilis; juxta parietes positas mensas ex argento conflato cum auro, super quibus erant varia utensilia ex lapidibus pretiosis, et ex integris gemmis in formis coelestibus; et plura, quae non aliquis oculus in terris viderat, et inde nec aliquis sibi fidem inducere potuerat, quod talia in Coelo sint.</p>
<p>
[3] Cum in stupore ex visis magnificis illis erant, dixit Angelus, ne miremini; haec quae videtis, non sunt aliqua manu angelica facta et fabricata, sed sunt condita ab Opifice Universi, et muneri data Principi nostro; quare hic est Ars architectonica in ipsa sua arte, et ex hac sunt omnes hujus artis regulae in Mundo. Porro dixit Angelus, vos potestis autumare quod talia fascinent oculos nostros, ac infatuent illos, usque ut credamus illa nostri Coeli gaudia esse; sed quia corda nostra non in illis sunt, sunt modo accessoria gaudiis cordium nostrorum; ideo quantum contemplamur illa ut accessoria, ac ut opificia Dei, tantum contemplamur Divinam Omnipotentiam et Clementiam in illis.<p>
