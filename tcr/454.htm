<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">恶人当中爱的友谊其实是彼此无法消除的仇恨</h4><br />454.前面说明，人皆有一个内在和一个外在，内在被称为他的内在人，外在被称为他的外在人。有必要补充以下事实：内在人存在于灵界，而外在人存在于尘世。人之所以如此受造，是为了他能与灵界的精灵并天人相联，并由此分析思考，死后从自己的世界转到另一个世界。灵界既指天堂，也指地狱。因为内在人与灵界的精灵并天人同在，外在人则与世人同在，所以很明显，人既能与地狱灵交往，也能与天堂天人交往。这样做的能力和力量将人和动物区分开。决定人本质的，是其内在人的性质，而非其外在人的性质，因为内在人就是他的灵，并经由外在人行动。他的灵在尘世所披戴的肉体是一个附加物，用来生殖和形成内在人。因为内在人在尘世得以形成，如同树在土壤中生长，或种子在果实中形成。关于内在人和外在人的更多内容，可参看前文（401节）。</p>

454. 惡人之間交心的友誼實際上是不可調解的憎恨
<p>前面(<a href="401.htm">401</a>, <a href="420.htm">420</a>)曾講過, 每個人有一個內在和一個外在; 這個內在被稱為他的"內在人", 其外在被稱為他的"外在人"。就此還要認清一個事實:內在人存在於心靈世界, 而外在人存在於物質世界。人如此被造的理由是為了能夠與心靈世界的靈和天人交往, 因而能理性地思維, 死後便能從他所在的世界轉移到另一個世界。
<p>心靈世界包括天國, 也指地獄。因為內在人與心靈世界的靈和天人在一起, 而外在人與世人一起生活, 很明顯, 一個人能與地獄的惡靈交往, 也能與天國的天人交往。這樣的力量與能力將人與動物區別開來。
<p>決定一個人的本質如何是他的內在人而非外在人, 因為內在人是他的靈, 內在人通過外在人來行動。人的靈在物質世界所穿戴的肉身, 只是個附加的物體, 用於繁殖, 以及方便內在人的形成。內在人形成於肉身之中, 如同樹在土中,種子在果實中。(關於內在與外在人的更多詳情, 請參看<a href="410.htm">410</a>節。) </p>

454. The Bond of Love between Evil People Is Actually a Deep Mutual Hatred
<p>I showed above [<a href="401.htm">401</a>, <a href="420.htm">420</a>] that we each have an inner level and an outer level and that our inner level is called our inner self and our outer level is called our outer self.
<p>To those points I will add the following: Our inner self is in the spiritual world and our outer self is in the physical world. We have been created with this nature so that we can be associated with spirits and angels in their world and be able to think analytically as a result, and also so that we can be transferred from our world to the other world after we die.
<p>"The spiritual world" means both heaven and hell. Since our inner self is present with spirits and angels in their world and our outer self is present with people, clearly we can be associated with spirits from hell and with angels from heaven. This faculty and ability differentiates us from animals.
<p>The way we are in our inner self is the way we truly are. We are not necessarily the way we appear on the outside. Our inner self is our spirit. It acts through our outer level. The physical body that our spirit wears in the physical world is something added on so that we can reproduce and so that our inner self can be formed. Our inner self is formed in our physical body like a tree in the ground or a seed in a piece of fruit. (For a number of points about the inner and outer self see <a href="401.htm">401</a> above.) </p>

454. XVII. Bosom friendship between the wicked is implacable hatred between them.<p>It was shown above that everyone has an internal and an external, the internal being called his internal man and the external his external man. To this must be added the fact that the internal man exists in the spiritual world and the external in the natural world. The reason why man was so created is so that he can associate with spirits and angels in their world, and as a result think analytically, and after death be transferred from his own world to the other. The spiritual world means both heaven and hell. Since the internal man is together with spirits and angels in their world, and the external man is among living men, it is plain that a person can consort with the spirits in hell or with the angels in heaven. The ability and power to do this distinguish man from animals. It is what a person is like in his internal man, not in his external man, that determines what he is essentially like, because the internal man is his spirit, and acts by means of the external. The material body, with which his spirit is clothed in the natural world, is an extra, needed for procreation and for the formation of the internal man. For this is formed in the natural body, like a tree in the ground, and a seed in the fruit. More facts about the internal and external man can be seen above (401). </p>

454. XVII. THE FRIENDSHIP OF LOVE AMONG THE EVIL IS INTESTINE HATRED OF EACH OTHER. <p>It has been shown above that every man has an internal and an external, and that his internal is called the internal man and his external the external man. To this may be added, that the internal man is in the spiritual world, and the external in the natural world. Man was so created in order that he might be associated with spirits and angels in their world, and might thereby be able to think analytically, and after death be transferred from his own world to another. By the spiritual world both heaven and hell are meant. As the internal man is in company with spirits and angels in their world, and the external man with men, it is evident that man can be affiliated both with the spirits of hell and with the angels of heaven. By this capacity and power man is distinguished from beasts. Man is essentially [in se] such as he is in his internal man, not such as he is in his external, for the internal man is his spirit, and this acts through the external. The material body with which his spirit is clothed in the natural world, is an accessory for the sake of procreation and for the sake of the formation of the internal man; for the internal man is formed in the natural body as a tree in the soil, or as seed in fruit. More on the internal and external man may be seen above (n. <a href="401.htm">401[1-9]</a>). </p>

454. XVII. THE FRIENDSHIP OF LOVE AMONG THE WICKED IS INTESTINE HATRED OF ONE ANOTHER.<p>It was shown above that every man has an internal and an external, the former being called the internal man, and the latter the external. To this may be added that the internal man is in the spiritual world, and the external in the natural world. Man was thus created that he might be associated with spirits and angels in their world, and consequently that he might think from particulars to principles, and after death be transferred from the one world to the other, that is, to the spiritual world, by which is meant both heaven and hell. Since, then, the internal man is associated with spirits and angels in their world, and the external with men, it is evident that man may be associated both with spirits of hell and with angels of heaven; by this faculty and power man is distinguished from the beasts. The essential nature of man is according to the nature of his internal and not of his external man, because the internal man is his spirit, which acts by means of the external man. The material body, with which his spirit is clothed in the natural world, is an accessory for the sake of procreation, and of the formation of the internal man; for the internal man is formed in the natural body, as a tree in the ground, and as seed in fruit. Further particulars concerning the internal and the external man may be seen above in <a href="401.htm">401</a>. </p>

454. Quod Amicitia amoris inter malos, sit intestinum odium inter illos.<p>Supra ostensum est, quod cuivis homini sit Internum et Externum, et quod Internum ejus dicatur Internus homo, et Externum ejus Externus homo; his adjicietur hoc, quod Internus homo sit in Mundo spirituali, et Externus in Mundo naturali; quod homo talis creatus sit, est causa, ut possit associari spiritibus et angelis in eorum Mundo, et inde analytice cogitare, ac post mortem transferri a suo in alterum. Per Mundum spiritualem intelligitur et Coelum et Infernum. Quoniam Internus homo una cum spiritibus et Angelis in eorum Mundo est, et Externus cum hominibus, patet quod homo possit consociari spiritibus Inferni, et quoque consociari Angelis Coeli; homo per hanc facultatem et potentiam distinguitur a bestiis. Homo qualis est quoad Internum suum hominem, talis est in se, non autem qualis est quoad Externum, quia Internus homo est ejus Spiritus, qui agit per Externum. Corpus materiale, quo Spiritus ejus in Mundo naturali investitus est, est accessorium propter Procreationes, et propter formationem Interni hominis; hic enim formatur in Naturali corpore, sicut arbor in terra, et semen in fructu. Plura de Interno et Externo homine videantur supra <a href="401.htm">401</a>. </p>
