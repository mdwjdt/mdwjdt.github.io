<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第289节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>289</b>.就属灵和属天之义而言，十诫普遍包含了教义与生活的一切戒律，因而包含了信与仁的全部。这是因为圣言字义的每一个细节，无论总体上的还是每个部分的，都包含两层内义，一个是所谓的属灵之义，一个是所谓的属天之义。这些意义包含神圣真理及其自己的光，并神圣良善及其自己的热。由于圣言无论就总体每个部分而言都是如此，故十诫的每一条必须按属世、属灵和属天这三层意义来诠释。从衣成有关圣经或圣言那一章的说明（193－208节）可以看出圣言具有这样的性质。</p>

289. 為何十誡就屬靈和屬天意義而言包含著教義和生活的一切原則, 也就是包含信與義的全部？這是因為聖言的文字意義, 無論是單個的細節, 還是總體而言, 以至於各方各面都含有兩層內在的意義, 一為屬靈, 一為屬天。這些意義包含著神性的真理(即真理之光)和神性的良善(即良善之熱)。因為聖言的總體與細節都是如此, 十誡的每一條也應當按其屬世,屬靈與屬天之義來詮釋。關於聖言的如此性質, 請參看之前關於聖言那章(第四章<a href="193.htm">193-208</a>節)所述。 </p>

289. In their spiritual and heavenly meanings, the Ten Commandments contain absolutely all the instructions to be taught and lived - all aspects of faith and goodwill. This is because each and every thing on both a large and a small scale in the Word's literal meaning conceals two inner meanings. One inner meaning is called spiritual, and the other, heavenly. Divine truth exists in its own light and divine goodness exists in its own warmth within these meanings. Because the Word has these characteristics as a whole and in each of its parts, the Ten Commandments need to be explained in all three meanings, called the earthly meaning, the spiritual meaning, and the heavenly meaning. You can see that this is the nature of the Word from the things I have shown above in the chapter on Sacred Scripture, or the Word, 193-208. </p>

289. The reason why the Ten Commandments in their spiritual and celestial senses contain in universal form all the commandments relating to doctrine and life, and so the whole of faith and charity, is that the literal sense of the Word in every single detail, both generally and in every part, conceals two inner senses, one called spiritual, the other celestial. And these senses contain Divine truth with its own light and Divine goodness with its own heat. Now since the Word is like this both generally and in every part, each of the Ten Commandments must be explained in those three senses, the natural, the spiritual and the celestial. The nature of the Word has already been shown to be like this by the demonstrations given in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture or the Word (193-208 above). </p>

289. In the spiritual and celestial senses the Decalogue contains universally all the precepts of doctrine and life, thus all things of faith and charity, because the Word in each and all things of the sense of the letter, or in general and in every part of it, conceals two interior senses, one called the spiritual sense and the other the celestial; also Divine truth in its light and the Divine good in its heat are in these two senses. And because the Word in general and in every part of it is so constituted, the ten commandments of the Decalogue must needs be explained according to these three senses, called the natural, the spiritual, and the celestial. That the Word is such can be seen from what has been shown above (n. <a href="193.htm">193-208</a>), in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture or the Word. </p>

289. The Decalogue, in its spiritual and celestial senses, contains universally all the precepts of doctrine and life, and thus all things of faith and charity. This is because the Word in every part of the sense of the Letter, both in general and in particular, contains two interior senses, one called the spiritual, and the other the celestial, in which there is Divine Truth in its own light, and Divine Good in its own heat. Now since this is the nature of the Word in general and in every part, the Ten Commandments of the Decalogue must be explained according to these three senses, called the natural, the spiritual, and the celestial. That this is the nature of the Word may be evident from what has been shown above in 183-208, in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture or the Word. </p>

289. Quod Decalogus in Sensu Spirituali et Coelesti contineat Universaliter omnia Praecepta Doctrinae et Vitae, ita omnia Fidei et Charitatis, est causa, quia Verbum in Sensu literae in omnibus et singulis ejus, seu in communi et in omni parte recondat binos Sensus interiores, unum qui vocatur Spiritualis, alterum qui Coelestis, et quod in his Sensibus sit Divina Veritas in sua luce, et Divina bonitas in suo calore: nunc quia Verbum in communi et in omni parte est tale, necessum est, ut Decalogi decem Praecepta secundum tres illos Sensus, qui vocantur Naturalis, Spiritualis, Coelestis, explicentur. Quod Verbum tale sit, constare potest ex illis, quae in Capite de SCRIPTURA SACRA seu VERBO, supra, <a href="193.htm">193-209</a>, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
