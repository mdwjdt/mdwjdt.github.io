703. How the Lord instituted the Holy Supper:
<p>Jesus prepared the Passover with his disciples. When evening had come, he reclined to dine with them. As they were eating, Jesus took the bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to the disciples. He said, "Take, eat; this is my body. " And taking the cup and giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you; this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many. " (<a href="3927/matthew_26_26.htm">Matthew 26:26-28</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_22.htm">Mark 14:22-24</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_19.htm">Luke 22:19-20</a>)
</p>
<p>
[2] What the Lord taught about his own flesh and his own blood, and about bread and wine:
<p>Work for food - not for the food that perishes but for the food that lasts to eternal life, which the Son of Humankind will give you. Truly, truly I say to you, Moses did not give you bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. The bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. I am the bread of life. Those who come to me will never be hungry, and those who believe in me will never be thirsty. I am the bread that came down from heaven. Truly, truly I say to you, those who believe in me have eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your ancestors ate manna in the desert and died. This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that anyone who eats of it will live and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will live forever. The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I am giving for the life of the world. Truly, truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Humankind and drink his blood, you will not have life within you. Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life; I will revive them on the last day. My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink. Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood live in me and I in them. (<a href="3927/john_6_27.htm">John 6:27</a>, , <a href="3927/john_6_35.htm">35</a>, <a href="3927/john_6_41.htm">41</a>, , ) </p>

[2] DOCTRINA DOMINI DE SUA CARNE ET SUO SANQUINE, DEQUE PANE ET VINO. Operamini cibum, non qui perit, sed cibum, qui manet in vitam aeternam, quem Filius hominis vobis dabit. Amen, amen, dico vobis, non Moses dedit vobis panem e Coelo, sed Pater meus dat vobis panem e Coelo verum: Panis namque Dei est, Qui descendit de Coelo, et vitam dat Mundo. Ego sum Panis vitae, qui venit ad Me, non esuriet, et qui credit in Me, non sitiet unquam. Ego sum Panis, qui descendit de Coelo. Amen, amen, dico vobis, qui credit in Me, habet vitam aeternam: Ego sum Panis vitae. Patres vestri comederunt Manna in deserto, et mortui sunt: Hic est Panis, qui e Coelo descendit, ut quis ex eo comedit vivat et non moriatur. Ego sum Panis vivens, qui e Coelo descendit; si quis comederit ex hoc Pane, vivet in saeculum; Panis, quem Ego dabo, Caro mea est, quam Ego dabo pro Mundi vita. Amen, amen, dico vobis, nisi comederitis Carnem Filii hominis, et biberitis Ejus Sanguinem, non habebitis vitam in vobis. Qui manducat meam Carnem, et bibit meum Sanguinem, habet vitam aeternam, et Ego resuscitabo illum in extrema die: nam Caro mea est vere Cibus, et Sanguis meus est vere Potus.
