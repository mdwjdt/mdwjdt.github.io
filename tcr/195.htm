<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第195节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>195</b>.属天神性、属灵神性和属世神性，一个接一个从主那里发出。凡从其神性之爱发出之物，皆以“属天神性”命名，属天神性就是良善。凡从其神圣智慧发出之物，皆以“属灵神性”命名，属灵神性就是一切真理。属世神性则来自这二者，在最外层是它们的全部。属天国度的天使构成第三层天，或高层天，处于从主发出、被称为属天神性的神性中，因为他们拥有来自主的爱之善。主的属灵国度的天使构成第二层天，或中层天，处于从主发出、被称为属灵神性的神性中，因为他们拥有来自主的神圣智慧。主的属世国度的天使构成第一层天，或低层天，处于从主发出、被称为属世神性的神性中，他们拥有来自主的仁之信。教会中人根据自己的爱、智慧和信而处在这三个国度的某个国度中。他们在哪个国度，死后就进入哪个国度。主的圣言就像天堂，就其最外在的意义而言，是属世的，就其内在属灵之义而言，是属天的。这三层意义都是神性。因此，它适合这三层天堂的天使，也适合世人。</p>

195. 從主那裡發出的神性, 相繼有屬天,屬靈和屬世之分。從主的聖仁發出的為屬天的神性,皆為善; 從主的聖智發出的為屬靈的神性,皆為理。而屬世的神性由之前二者而出, 是二者結合的最外在(或最低層)层次。
<p>主的屬天國度中的天人, 構成第三層或者最高層的天國, 沐浴在從主發出,被稱為屬天的神性之中, 因為他們擁有從主而來的對良善的热愛。主的屬靈國度的天人, 構成第二層或者中間層的天國, 沐浴在從主發出,被稱為屬靈的神性之中, 因為他們擁有從主而來的神性智慧。主的屬世國度的天人, 構成第一層或最底層的天國, 沐浴在從主發出,被稱為屬世的神性之中。他們都擁有從主而來的,與義相連的信。教會之中的人處在哪一層天國, 取決於各自的仁,智或信如何。照著他們各自擁有的如何, 死後進入相對應的天國。 </p>

195. There is a heavenly divine influence, a spiritual divine influence, and an earthly divine influence that emanate from the Lord, one after the other. Whatever emanates from the Lord's divine love is called heavenly divine influence; all of it is good. Whatever emanates from his divine wisdom is called spiritual divine influence; all of it is true. His earthly divine influence comes from the other two influences; it is a combination of them on the lowest level.
<p>The angels of the [Lord's] heavenly kingdom, who constitute the third or highest heaven, are bathed in the divine influence emanating from the Lord that is called heavenly, for they have a love for what is good from the Lord. The angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, who constitute the second or middle heaven, are in the divine influence emanating from the Lord that is called spiritual, for they have divine wisdom from the Lord. The angels of the Lord's earthly kingdom, who constitute the first or lowest heaven, are in the divine influence emanating from the Lord that is called the divine earthly influence. They have a faith from the Lord that is connected to goodwill. People in the church, however, are in any one of the three kingdoms depending on the people's love, wisdom, or faith. Depending on which of these the people have, they come into that heaven after death.
<p>The Lord's Word is like heaven. In its outermost meaning it is earthly; in its inner meaning it is spiritual; in its inmost meaning it is heavenly. All three are divine. It has been adapted, then, to the angels of the three heavens and to people as well. </p>

195. From the Lord there proceed, one after the other, the celestial Divine, the spiritual Divine and the natural Divine. The name 'celestial Divine' is given to whatever proceeds from His Divine love, and it is good. The name 'spiritual Divine' is given to whatever proceeds from His Divine wisdom, and it is all truth. The natural Divine comes from both of these, being their totality at the outermost level. The angels of the celestial kingdom, which make up the third or highest heaven, are in the Divine called celestial which proceeds from the Lord, for they are in possession of the good of love coming from the Lord. The angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, who make up the second or middle heaven, are in the Divine called spiritual which proceeds from the Lord, for they are in possession of Divine wisdom coming from the Lord. The angels of the Lord's natural kingdom, who make up the first or lowest heaven, are in the Divine called natural which proceeds from the Lord, and they possess the faith of charity coming from the Lord. However, the people who make up the church are in one or other of those kingdoms, depending upon their love, wisdom and faith; and after death they come into the same kingdom as that in which they were previously. The pattern of heaven is repeated in the Word of the Lord. In its outermost sense it is natural, in a more inward sense spiritual, and in its inmost sense celestial, each sense being Divine. It is consequently suitable for the angels of the three heavens and also for men. </p>

195. From the Lord the Divine Celestial, the Divine Spiritual, and the Divine Natural go forth one after the other. Whatever goes forth from the Lord's Divine love is called the Divine Celestial, everything of which is good; whatever goes forth from His Divine wisdom is called the Divine Spiritual, everything of which is truth; the Divine Natural is from both of these and is their complex in the outmost. The angels of the celestial kingdom, who constitute the third or highest heaven, are in that Divine going forth from the Lord which is called celestial, since they are in good of love from the Lord. The angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, who constitute the second or middle heaven, are in that Divine going forth from the Lord which is called spiritual, since they are in Divine wisdom from the Lord. The angels of the Lord's natural kingdom, who constitute the first or lowest heaven, are in that Divine going forth from the Lord which is called the Divine natural, and they are in the faith of charity from the Lord. Men of the church are in some one of these kingdoms according to their love, their wisdom, and their faith; and whichever one they are in, that they enter into after death. Such as heaven is such also is the Lord's Word; in its outmost sense it is natural, in its interior sense spiritual, and in its inmost sense celestial, and in each of these senses it is Divine. Thus is it adapted to the angels of the three heavens, and also to man. </p>

195. From the Lord proceed the Divine celestial, the Divine spiritual and the Divine natural, one after another. What proceeds from His Divine Love is called the Divine celestial, and all this is good; what proceeds from His Divine Wisdom is called the Divine spiritual, and all this is truth; the Divine natural is from both, comprising both in their ultimate form. The angels of the celestial kingdom, who constitute the third or highest heaven, are in the Divine which proceeds from the Lord, called the celestial, for they are in the good of love from the Lord. The angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, who constitute the second or middle heaven, are in the Divine which proceeds from the Lord, called the spiritual, for they are in Divine Wisdom from the Lord. The angels of the Lord's natural kingdom, who constitute the first or lowest heaven, are in the Divine which proceeds from the Lord, called the Divine natural, and they are in the faith of charity from the Lord. Men of the Church [on earth], however, are in one of these three kingdoms according to their love, wisdom and faith, and after death they enter that kingdom in which they are [in spirit]. The Word of the Lord is similar in nature to heaven. In its ultimate sense it is natural, in its interior sense it is spiritual, and in its inmost sense it is celestial; and in each of these senses it is Divine. It is therefore accommodated to the angels of the three heavens, and also to men. </p>

195. A Domino procedit DIVINUM COELESTE, DIVINUM SPIRITUALE ET DIVINUM NATURALE, unum post alterum. DIVINUM COELESTE vocatur quicquid procedit a Divino Amore Ipsius, et omne id est Bonum: DIVINUM SPIRITUALE vocatur quicquid procedit a Divina Sapientia Ipsius, et omne id est Verum. DIVINUM NATURALE est ex utroque; est illorum complexus in ultimo. Angeli Regni Coelestis [Domini], <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
ex quibus est Tertium seu Supremum Coelum, sunt in Divino quod procedit a Domino, quod Coeleste vocatur, nam sunt in Bono amoris a Domino. Angeli Regni spiritualis Domini, ex quibus est Secundum seu Medium Coelum, sunt in Divino quod procedit a Domino, quod Spirituale vocatur, nam sunt in Divina sapientia <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
a Domino: Angeli Regni Naturalis Domini, ex quibus est Primum seu infimum Coelum, sunt in Divino quod procedit a Domino, quod Divinum Naturale vocatur, et sunt in fide charitatis a Domino. Homines autem Ecclesiae, sunt secundum amorem, sapientiam, ac fidem eorum, in uno ex illis Regnis; et in quo sunt, in illud etiam post mortem veniunt. Quale est Coelum, tale etiam est Verbum Domini; in ultimo suo sensu est Naturale, in interiori est Spirituale, ac in intimo Coeleste, et in singulis Divinum; quare accommodatum est Angelis Trium Coelorum, et quoque Hominibus.<p>
