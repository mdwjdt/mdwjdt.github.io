<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第147节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>147</b>.迄今为止，教会几乎完全不知道以下事实：人的一切意愿和思维，以及随之而来的一切言行既有内在的一面，也有外在的一面，并且人从小就被谆谆教导，要照着外在的那一面说话，无论内在有多么抵触。这就是伪装、不诚实和虚伪的来源；人就这样变得口是心非，具有双重心智。唯有那些心思简单之人的外在是出于内在思考、说话、意愿和行事。这种人就是圣言所说的简单人（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.15.htm">如路加福音8:15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.34.htm">11:34</a>等），然而他们却比那些具有双重心智的人更有智慧。一切受造物都是双重或三重的，这从人体的各个部位明显看出来。每根神经都由纤维构成，每根纤维都由原纤维构成；每块肌肉都由纤维束构成，这些纤维束则由运动纤维构成；每根动脉由内中外三层膜构成。人的心智也一样，其属灵组织就具有类似特点，因为如前所述（34，42，69节），它被分成三个不同区域。其最高区域，也就是至内层，被称为属天层，中间区域被称为属灵层，最低区域则被称为属世层。所有否认圣言的圣洁和主的神性之人的心智都在最低层进行思考。但由于这种人从小就学习教会有关属灵事物的教导，并接受它们，不过却将其置于属世事物，也就是各种科学、政治和道德事物之下，还由于这些属灵事物占据最接近言语的心智最低层，故当预备在教会和聚会中发言时，他们便利用这些东西讲话。奇妙的是，那时他们完全没有意识到他们并非出于自己里面的信仰在讲话和教导。而事实上，他们在自由状态下，如私下里，关闭其心智内在的那扇门便被打开，这种时候，他们有时会嘲笑自己之前公开所传讲的那些话，发自内心说，神学就是捕捉鸽子的各种诡异圈套。</p>

147. 教會至今對以下事實幾乎完全無知:一個人的所有意志和認知, 從而所有的行動和言語, 都有內外兩面。人們從小就被教導以外在一面去說話, 不管裡面的分歧, 這就導致了虛偽,做作和偽善的產生。這樣, 人就成了雙面的。簡單的人, 說所想的,行所願的, 與自己的內在那面保持一致。這樣的人實際上指的是像聖言所說的簡單之人。例如<a href="3927/luke_8_15.htm">路加福音8:15</a>; <a href="3927/luke_11_34.htm">11:34</a>, Luke 11: 以及其它地方, 他們比雙面人更有智慧。
<p>所有被造之物都是雙重的或三重的設計, 可從人的身體來證明。每根神經由纖維構成, 每根纖維由小纖維構成。每塊肌肉由纖維束構成, 每條纖維束由運動纖維構成。每根動脈由內中外三層膜構成。人的思想(也就是心靈)的組成形式也是以同樣的方式, 如之前說過(<a href="34.htm">34</a>, <a href="42.htm">42</a>, <a href="69.htm">69</a>節), 人的思想分為三個層次。最高層,也是最內層, 為屬天; 中間層為屬靈; 最低層為屬世。
<p>有人否認聖言的神聖以及主的神性, 這些人的思想處於最低層。儘管他們從小在教會受了這些屬靈的教導,並且認同, 然而卻將這些屬靈的教導屈服在屬世的成見之下——就是各樣學術,政治,道德和文明行為方面當做的事情之下。因為這些屬世的成見位於他們思想的最底層, 就是與發言最相近的層級, 因此這些人能在教會或聚會的發言中利用這些內容。令人驚奇的是, 他們絲毫沒有意識到他們正在談論與教導著一些他們並不相信的事情。不過, 當他們回到家時, 本來封堵著他們思想內在的大門一下開了(在自己家中, 處在自由的狀態, 無需掩飾自己, 思想的內在一面就敞開了), 有時連他們自己都覺得在公開場合所講的內容荒唐可笑。他們在內心說, 神學教導只不過是用來抓捕鴿子的迷人的圈套而已。 </p>

147. The church is still hardly aware that in all our desire, thought, action, and speech, there is an inside and an outside. From early childhood we are taught to speak from the outside, no matter how the inside disagrees, which leads to pretense, flattery, and hypocrisy. People are double. The only simple people are those whose outer selves think and speak, and desire and act, from their inner selves. These people are in fact referred to as "simple" in the Word; for example, <a href="3927/luke_8_15.htm">Luke 8:15</a>, <a href="3927/luke_11_34.htm">11:34</a>, and elsewhere, even though they are wiser than double people.
<p>Every created thing has two-fold and three-fold design, as the human body shows. Every nerve in the body is made of fibers, and every fiber is made of fibrils. Every muscle consists of bundles of fibers, and each bundle consists of individual motor fibers. Every artery consists of three layers of sheaths. It is the same in the human mind - its spiritual organic structure is the same. As I said before [34, 42, 69], the structure of the human mind is divided into three different levels. The highest or inmost of these is called the heavenly level, the middle is called the spiritual level, and the lowest is called the earthly level.
<p>There are people who deny that the Word is holy and that the Lord is divine; in every case their minds think at the lowest level. Nevertheless, because these people have learned the church's spiritual teachings from early childhood, they accept them, but they put them down below earthly preoccupations, which are various things having to do with academics, politics, and the civic and moral arena. Because these preoccupations sit at the lowest level of their mind, the level that is closest to speech, these people draw on the church's spiritual teachings when they speak in church and at public gatherings. Astoundingly, at the time they do not even realize that they are speaking and teaching something they do not believe. Nevertheless, when they are at home and feeling free, the door that had closed off their inner mind opens up and then they laugh at their own talk to the crowd. They say in their hearts that theological teachings are attractive traps for catching doves. </p>

147. The church up to now has been almost totally ignorant of the fact that a person's every wish and thought, and consequently every action and utterance, has an internal and an external side, and people are taught from childhood to speak in accordance with the external side, no matter how much the internal disagrees. This is the origin of pretence, insincerity and hypocrisy. It follows that people are duplicitous, and the only man who is simple is the one whose external thinks and speaks, and wills and acts, in accordance with the internal. It is these people who are meant in the Word by the simple (e.g, <a href="3927/luke_8_15.htm">Luke 8:15</a>, <a href="3927/luke_11_34.htm">11:34</a>, etc.), although they are wiser than the duplicitous. Every created thing is double or triple, as can be proved from the human body. Every nerve is composed of fibres, every fibre of fibrils; every muscle of bundles of fibres, and these bundles are composed of motor fibres; every artery is composed of a triple series of tunics. It is the same in the human mind, which is spiritually organised in the same way, because, as stated before, the human mind is divided into three levels. The highest, which is also the inmost, is called celestial, the middle spiritual, and the lowest natural. The minds of all who deny the holiness of the Word and the Lord's divinity think on the lowest level. But because they have also learned from childhood the church's teaching on spiritual matters, and they accept these though they subordinate them to natural matters - that is, various facts, political and civil behaviour - and since these lie at the bottom of the mind, ready to hand when speaking, they can draw on these when speaking in churches and meetings. The extraordinary thing is that they are then quite unaware that they are speaking and teaching otherwise than in accordance with their belief. Yet the truth is that when they are left to themselves, as they are at home, the door which blocked off the internal of their mind is thrown open, and then they sometimes laugh at what they said when speaking in public, saying in their hearts that theology is a collection of specious traps for catching doves. </p>

147. It is as yet scarcely known in the church that in all of man's will and thought and his consequent action and speech, there is an internal and an external, and that from infancy man is carefully taught to speak from the external, however the internal may dissent; and that this is the origin of simulation, flattery, and hypocrisy; and thus man becomes double-minded. But he alone is single-minded whose external thinks and speaks and wills and acts from the internal; and such are meant by the "simple [single]" in the Word (as in <a href="3927/luke_8_15.htm">Luke 8:15</a>; <a href="3927/luke_11_34.htm">11:34</a>; and elsewhere). Nevertheless these are wiser than those who are double-minded. The doubleness and tripleness in every created thing is evident in the parts of the human body. Every nerve therein consists of fibers, and every fiber of fibrils; every muscle consists of bundles of fibers, and these of motor fibers; every artery of coats in a triple series. It is the same in the human mind, whose spiritual organization is of like character, because, as said already, it is divided into three distinct regions; of which the highest, which is also the inmost, is called the celestial, the middle is called the spiritual, and the lowest the natural. It is in this lower region that the minds of all men who deny the holiness of the Word and the Divinity of the Lord carry on thought. But because such have learned also from infancy the spiritual things pertaining to the church, and accept these, but place them beneath natural things (that is, scientific, political, and civil-moral matters of various kinds), also because these spiritual things occupy the lowest part of the mind, which is nearest to speech, it comes to pass that when such persons speak in churches and public assemblies they speak from these; and what is wonderful, they are quite unaware at the time that they are not speaking and teaching from a belief in them. But when they are in freedom, as they are in privacy, the door that has closed the internal of their mind is opened, and then at times they laugh at what they had before preached publicly, saying in their hearts that theology is a specious snare for catching doves. </p>

147. The Church, as yet, hardly knows that in all human will and thought, and resulting action and speech, there is an internal and an external; and that a man from infancy is taught to speak from the external, however much the internal may dissent: whence arise dissimulation, flattery and hypocrisy. Consequently man is a dual being, and those alone have singleness of mind whose external thinks and speaks, wills and acts from the internal. Such are meant by the simple in the Word, as in <a href="3927/luke_8_15.htm">Luke 8:15</a>; <a href="3927/luke_11_34.htm">11:34</a>; and in other places, although they are wiser than those of a double character. That every created thing is of a double and triple character is evident from the parts of the human body, in which every nerve consists of fibres, and every fibre of fibrils; every muscle is composed of bundles of fibres, and these again of motor fibres; and every artery is formed of coats in a triple series.<p>It is the same in the human mind, whose spiritual organization is of a similar nature; that is, as was stated above, the human mind is divided into three regions, the highest, which is also the inmost, being called the celestial, the middle the spiritual, and the lowest the natural. The minds of all those who deny the sanctity of the Word and the Divinity of the Lord, think in the lowest region. However, because they from infancy have also been instructed in the spiritual things of the Church, and still retain them, although regarding them as inferior to natural things, which are the various kinds of scientific, political, civil and moral knowledge; and because these spiritual things remain on the lowest plane of their minds and nearest to speech, they speak from them in churches and in assemblies; and, what is wonderful, they do not know but that they speak and teach from their own sincere belief. Nevertheless when they are free, as they are in their own home, the door which closed the internal of their minds is opened, and then sometimes they laugh at those things which they preached in public, saying in heart that theology is but a specious snare for catching doves. </p>

147. Ecclesia adhuc fere nescit, quod in omni voluntate et cogitatione et inde actione et loquela hominis sit Internum et Externum, et quod homo ab infantia edoctus sit loqui ab Externo utcunque dissentit Internum, inde simulationes, assentationes et hypocrises; consequenter quod sit duplex, et ille modo simplex, cujus Externum cogitat et loquitur, atque vult et agit ab Interno, hi quoque per simplices intelliguntur in Verbo, ut <a href="3927/luke_8_15.htm">Luca 8:15</a>; <a href="3927/luke_11_34.htm">11:34</a>, et alibi, tametsi plus sapientes sunt, quam duplices. Quod duplicitas et triplicitas sit in omni creato, constat ab his in corpore humano; omnis Nervus ibi consistit a fibris, et fibra a fibrillis; omnis Musculus ex fasciculis fibrarum, et hi ex fibris motricibus; omnis Arteria ex tunicis in triplici serie; simile est in Mente humana, cujus organismus spiritualis est talis; hoc est quod, ut supra dictum est, Mens humana in tres regiones distincta sit, quarum suprema, quae etiam est intima, vocatur coelestis, media spiritualis, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
et infima naturalis. Mentes omnium hominum, qui negant sanctitatem Verbi et Divinitatem Domini, cogitant in regione infima, sed quia ab infantia didicerunt etiam spiritualia quae Ecclesiae sunt, et haec recipiunt, at illa ponunt infra naturalia, quae sunt varia scientifica, politica et civilia moralia, et quia infime et proxime loquelae in mente sedent, ex illis loquuntur in templis et in caetibus, et, quod mirum est, non aliter sciunt tunc, quam quod loquantur et doceant ex fide illorum, cum tamen, quando in suo libero sunt, quod fit domi, aperitur janua, quae occlusit internum mentis eorum, et tunc quandoque rident ad illa, quae coram caetu sermocinati sunt, dicentes corde, quod Theologica sint speciosi laquei ad captandum columbas.<p>
