686. In the Word we read that the Lord God our Redeemer baptizes with the Holy Spirit and with fire. This means the Lord regenerates us with divine truth that is related to faith and divine goodness that is related to love and goodwill; see above in the first section under this heading [684].
<p>In the heavens, those who have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit, that is, by divine truth that is related to faith, are differentiated from those who have been regenerated by fire, that is, by divine goodness that is related to love. The angels who have been regenerated by divine truth that is related to faith walk around in heaven in clothes of white linen and are called spiritual angels. Those who have been regenerated by divine goodness that is related to love walk around in red clothes and are called heavenly angels.
<p>The following passages refer to the angels that walk around in white clothes: "Clothed in linen that is white and clean, they follow the Lamb" (<a href="3927/revelation_19_14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>). "They will walk with me in white" (<a href="3927/revelation_3_4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>; ). The angels seen at the Lord's tomb were wearing "white" and "shining" clothes (<a href="3927/matthew_28_3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a>; <a href="3927/luke_24_4.htm">Luke 24:4</a>). All these angels were of this type. Linen means the just actions of those who are holy, as is openly stated in <a href="3927/revelation_19_8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>. (For the fact that the clothes mentioned in the Word mean truths, and clothes of white and linen mean divine truths, see <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_379.htm">Revelation Unveiled 379</a>, where this is demonstrated.)
<p>The angels who have been regenerated by divine goodness that is related to love have red clothing because red is the color of love. It is a color derived from the sun's fire and its redness, and the sun means love (see <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_468.htm">Revelation Unveiled 468</a>, <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_725.htm">725</a>).
<p>It is because clothes mean truths that the guest who was found not wearing a wedding garment was thrown out and hurled into outer darkness (<a href="3927/matthew_22_11.htm">Matthew 22:11-13</a>). </p>

686. It is said in the Word that the Lord God our Redeemer baptises with the Holy Spirit and with fire; this means that the Lord regenerates a person by means of the Divine truth of faith and by means of the Divine good of love or of charity, on which see above, 684. Those who have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit, that is, by the Divine truth of faith can in the heavens be told apart from those who have been regenerated by fire, that is, by the Divine good of love. Those who have been regenerated by the Divine truth of faith go around in heaven dressed in clothing of white linen, and are called spiritual angels. Those who have been regenerated by the Divine good of love go around in purple clothing, and are called celestial angels. It is those who go dressed in white clothing who are meant in these passages:<p>They follow the Lamb dressed in white and clean fine linen, <a href="3927/revelation_19_14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>.<p>They will walk with me in white, <a href="3927/revelation_3_4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>; also <a href="3927/revelation_7_14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>.<p>The angels in the Lord's tomb were seen in white, shining garments (<a href="3927/matthew_28_3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a>; <a href="3927/luke_24_4.htm">Luke 24:4</a>). They were of the spiritual type, for fine linen means the righteous acts of the saints (<a href="3927/revelation_19_8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>, where this is explicitly stated). For clothes in the Word meaning truths, and white clothes and fine linen meaning Divine truths, see Apocalypse Revealed (397), where this was shown.<p>The reason why those who have also been regenerated by means of the Divine good of love wear purple clothing is that purple is the colour of love, a colour derived from the fire and redness of the sun; fire means love (see <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_468.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 468</a>, <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_725.htm">725</a>). It is because clothes mean truths that the man among the invited guests who was not wearing a wedding garment was thrown out and cast into outer darkness (<a href="3927/matthew_22_11.htm">Matthew 22:11-13</a>). </p>

686. It is said in the Word that the Lord God our Redeemer baptizes with the Holy Spirit and with fire, which means that the Lord regenerates man by the Divine truth of faith and the Divine good of love or charity (as may be seen above in the first number of this section). Those who have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit, that is, by the Divine truth of faith, are distinct in the heavens from those who are regenerated by fire, that is, by the Divine good of love. Those who have been regenerated by the Divine truth of faith walk in heaven in raiment of white linen, and are called spiritual angels; but those who have been regenerated by the Divine good of love walk in purple raiment, and are called celestial angels. Those who go clothed in white raiment are meant by the following: <p>They follow the Lamb clothed in fine linen, white and clean (<a href="3927/revelation_19_14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>). <p>They shall walk with Me in white (<a href="3927/revelation_3_4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>; also <a href="3927/revelation_7_14.htm">7:14</a>). <p>The angels seen at the Lord's sepulchre clothed in white and shining garments (<a href="3927/matthew_28_3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a>; <a href="3927/luke_24_4.htm">Luke 24:4</a>). <p>They were of this class, because "fine linen" signifies the righteousness of the saints (<a href="3927/revelation_19_8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>, where this is directly stated). That "garments" in the Word signify truths, and "garments of white" and "fine linen" signify Divine truths, may be seen in the Apocalypse Revealed, where this is shown (n. <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_379.htm">379[1-7]</a>). Those who have been regenerated by the Divine good of love are clothed in purple garments, because purple is the color of love, which color it derives from the fire of the sun and its redness. (That this signifies love may be seen in the Apocalypse Revealed, n. <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_468.htm">468</a>, <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_725.htm">725</a>.) It was because "garments" signify truths, that he who was found among those called to the wedding not clothed with a wedding garment, was turned out and cast into outer darkness (<a href="3927/matthew_22_11.htm">Matthew 22:11-13</a>). </p>

This means that the Lord regenerates man by the Divine Truth of faith and the Divine Good of love or of charity, as may be seen above in this Article, <a href="684.htm">684</a>. Those who have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit, that is, by the Divine Truth of faith, are distinguished in the heavens from those who have been regenerated by fire, that is, by the Divine Good of love.
