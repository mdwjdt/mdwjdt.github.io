829. 由于宗教在人内占据最高位, 较低事物通过最高事物拥有生命和光明, 也由于穆罕默德总是与伊斯兰教徒心中的宗教联系在一起, 且他们眼前总有穆罕默德的形象, 为了将他们的脸面转向主在上面的东方, 所以他被安排在基督徒中心区的下面。 这不是写《可兰经》的那个穆罕默德, 而是扮演这个角色的另一个人, 也不总是同一个人, 而是变化的。 以前它是一个萨克森人, 这人过去被阿尔及利亚人抓获, 变成了伊斯兰教徒, 由于他曾是基督徒, 所以有时会主动和他们谈论主, 告诉他们祂如何不是约瑟的儿子, 而是神自己的儿子。 其他人也相继扮演过穆罕默德。 在扮演穆罕默德的人所住的地方, 会出现如同小火把似的一堆火, 作为识别的标志。 但这火只有伊斯兰教徒才能看见。 </p>

</h4>
<p>
829. Since religion dwells in the highest levels within us, and our lower levels draw their life and light from those highest levels, and because the idea of Muhammad is always uppermost in Muslim minds along with their religion, there is always some Muhammad who is set visibly before Muslims in the spiritual world. To get them to turn their faces toward the east, the region closest to the Lord, this Muhammad is placed below the center of the Christian region. This is not, however, Muhammad himself, the writer of the Qur'an, but someone else who plays the role of Muhammad. It is not always the same person either; it changes. One of the Muhammads had come from Saxony but had been taken captive by Algerians and had become a Muslim. Because he had originally been Christian, he was encouraged a number of times to tell the Muslims that the Lord was not the son of Joseph but rather the Son of God himself. Later on, other Muhammads took over from this one.
<p>In the place where that representative Muhammad is to be found there appears a fire like that of a burning torch, so that people will recognize who he is. That fire is visible only to Muslims, however, and not to others. </p>

829. Since religion occupies the highest levels in a person, and the highest levels give life and light to the levels below, and because Mohammed is associated in their minds with religion, there is always a Mohammed set for them to see. So that they should face the east, above which the Lord is, he is placed below the Christian centre. He is not the real Mohammed who wrote the Koran, but another who discharges his office; nor is it always the same one, but he changes. At one time it was a man from Saxony who was captured by Algerians and became a Mohammedan. Since he had also been a Christian, he was sometimes impelled to talk to them about the Lord, telling them how He was not the son of Joseph, but the Son of God Himself. Others succeeded him as Mohammed. In the place where this representative of Mohammed lives, a fire like that of a torch is to be seen, as a mark of recognition. But this fire is invisible to all but Mohammedans. </p>

829. Because religion has its seat in the highest things in man, and the lower things in him have life and light from the highest, and because Mohammed is always associated with religion in the minds of Mohammedans, some Mohammed is always kept before their sight; and in order that they may turn their faces toward the east, over which is the Lord, he is placed beneath the Christian center. This is not the Mohammed who wrote the Koran, but another person who fills his office; nor is it always the same person; but he is changed. Formerly it was a man from Saxony who had been taken prisoner by the Algerines, and had become a Mohammedan; and having once been a Christian he was sometimes moved to speak to them about the Lord, saying that He was not Joseph's son but the Son of God Himself. Other Mohammedans afterward succeeded this one. In the place where that representative Mohammedan has his station; there appears a fire like a small torch to distinguish him; but that fire is invisible to all but Mohammedans. </p>

829. Religion has its seat with man in what is highest, and from the highest what is lower derives its life and light. Now because the idea of Mohammed is associated with religion in the minds of Mohammedans, therefore some one is always placed before their view as Mohammed; and so that they may turn their faces towards the east, over which is the Lord, he is placed beneath the Christian centre. This is not the Mohammed who wrote the Koran, <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
but another who takes his place; nor is it always the same person, but he is changed. Once this position was held by a native of Saxony, who was taken captive by the Algerians <sup "fn9_2">2</sup>
and became a Mohammedan. Having been a Christian, he was frequently moved to speak to them about the Lord, and to declare that He was not Joseph's son, but the Son of God Himself. This Mohammed was in turn succeeded by others. In the place where this representative Mohammed has his quarters, to mark his presence there burns it torch-like flame, which, however, is visible only to Mohammedans.<p>

<p>
829. Quoniam Religio in supremis apud hominem residet, et ex supremis vivunt et lucent inferiora ejus, et quia Mahumedes versatur in animis illorum una cum Religione, ideo semper aliquis Mahumedes in conspectu illorum ponitur, ac ut vertant facies suas ad Orientem, super quo est Dominus, ponitur ille infra Meditullium Christianum: non est ipse Mahumedes, qui Alcoranum conscripsit, sed alius qui munere ejus fungitur; nec est idem semper, sed mutatur: quondam fuit unus ex Saxonia, qui captus ab Algiriensibus factus est Mahumedanus; is quia Christianus etiam fuerat, aliquoties actus est ad loquendum cum illis de Domino, quod non fuerit Filius Josephi, sed Filius Ipsius Dei. Isti Mahumedi successerunt postea alii. In loco ubi repraesentativus ille Mahumedes sedem habet, apparet ignis sicut faculae, ut noscatur; sed ille ignis non conspicuus est aliis, quam Mahumedanis. </p>
