<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>221</b>.（5）同样由耶路撒冷圣殿的外在部分来表示。这是因为圣殿和会幕一样，也代表天堂和教会。不过，圣殿代表属灵天使所在的天堂，而会幕则表示属天天使所在的天堂。属灵天使是指那些通过圣言拥有智慧的人，而属天天使是指那些通过圣言拥有爱的人。主自己在约翰福音教导我们说，耶路撒冷的圣殿，在至高意义上表示主的神性人：<br />你们拆毁这殿，我三日内要再建立起来。但耶稣所说的殿是指他的身体。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.19.htm">约翰福音2:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.21.htm">21</a>）<br />表示主，也就表示圣言，因为主就是圣言。由于圣殿的内在部分代表天堂和教会的内在，因而也表示圣言的内在，故圣殿的外在部分代表和表示天堂和教会的外在，因而表示圣言的外在，也就是圣言的字义。关于圣殿的外在部分，我们读到：<br />建殿是用（未修整）的整块石头，内有香柏木；周围的墙上都刻着基路伯、棕树和初开的花；地板都贴上金子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.7.htm">列王纪上6:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.29.htm">29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.30.htm">30</a>）<br />所有这些事物都表示圣言的外在，也就是圣言字义中的神圣事物。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #221 </h4>
<p>
221. (5)類似的, 耶路撒冷中聖殿的外在部分也是此意。
<p> 這是因為, 如同會幕那樣, 聖殿也代表天國和教會。聖殿表示屬靈天人所在的天國, 會幕則表示屬天天人所在的天國。那些處於聖言而來的義與信之中的, 是屬靈天人(也就是義信天人)。而處於聖言而來的仁與智之中的, 則是屬天天人(也就是仁智天人)。耶路撒冷的聖殿, 最高層的意義, 表示主的神性之人(祂在地上所取的人身), 祂在『約翰福音』中教導:你們摧毀這殿, 我三日內要再建立起來; 耶穌這話是以祂的身體為殿(<a href="3927/john_2_19.htm">約翰福音2:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_2_21.htm">21</a>)。
<p>表示主, 也表示聖言, 因為祂就是聖言。於是, 聖殿的內在部分代表天國和教會的內在, 也表示聖言的內在。因此聖殿的外在部分代表和預示著天國和教會,也是聖言的外在——聖言的文字意義。
<p>關於聖殿的外在部分, 我們讀到:建殿是用未修整的整塊石頭, 內有香柏木; 所有的牆上都刻有基路伯,棕樹和初開的花; 地板上都貼有金子(<a href="3927/1-kings_6_7.htm">列王記上6:7</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_29.htm">29-30</a>)。所有這些都表示聖言的外在之物, 就是聖言的文字意義。 </p>

221. 5. The exteriors of the Temple in Jerusalem, as well, represented the types of good and truth that exist in the Word's literal meaning. The Temple represented heaven and the church just as the tabernacle did, although the Temple meant the heaven where the spiritual angels are, while the tabernacle meant the heaven where the heavenly angels are. Spiritual angels have wisdom because of the Word. Heavenly angels have love because of the Word.
<p>The Lord himself teaches in John that in its highest meaning the Temple at Jerusalem stood for the Lord's divine-human manifestation:
<p>"Break this temple in pieces and I will raise it in three days. " He was speaking of the temple of his body. (<a href="3927/john_2_19.htm">John 2:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_2_21.htm">21</a>)
<p>When something means the Lord it also means the Word, because he is the Word.
<p>Since the interiors of the Temple represented the inner parts of heaven and the church, and the inner parts of the Word as well, its exteriors in turn represented and meant the outer parts of heaven and the church, and the outer parts of the Word as well, which belong to its literal meaning. We read of the exteriors of the Temple that they were built of whole, uncut stone, with cedar on the inside face; all the walls were carved on the inside with angel guardians, palm trees, and open flowers; and the floor was overlaid with gold (<a href="3927/1-kings_6_7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_29.htm">29-30</a>). All these details stand for the outer parts of the Word, which are holy aspects of its literal meaning. </p>

221. (v) LIKEWISE, THE EXTERNAL FEATURES OF THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM.<p>This was because the Temple, exactly like the Tabernacle, represented heaven and the church; but the Temple represented the heaven of the spiritual angels, the Tabernacle that of the celestial angels. Spiritual angels are those who possess wisdom from the Word, celestial angels are those who possess love from the Word. The Lord Himself teaches us in John that the Temple at Jerusalem means in the highest sense the Lord's Divine Human:<p>Break up this Temple, and in three days I will raise it again. He was speaking about the temple of His body, <a href="3927/john_2_19.htm">John 2:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_2_21.htm">21</a>.<p>When the Lord is meant, so too is the Word, for He is the Word. Now since the interior parts of the Temple represented the interiors of heaven and the church, and so those of the Word, therefore its external parts also represented and stood for the exteriors of heaven and the church, and so those of the Word, that is, its literal sense. We read of the exterior of the Temple that it was built of whole, undressed stones, and inside of cedar-wood; all its walls were carved inside with cherubim, palms and open flowers, and the floor was overlaid with gold (<a href="3927/1-kings_6_7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_29.htm">29-30</a>). All these things too stand for the externals of the Word, which are the holy things in its literal sense. </p>

221. (5) Likewise by the externals of the temple at Jerusalem. This is because heaven and the church were represented by the temple as well as by the tabernacle, the temple representing the heaven in which spiritual angels dwell, and the tabernacle the heaven where celestial angels dwell. Spiritual angels are those who are in wisdom from the Word, celestial angels those who are in love from the Word. That the temple at Jerusalem signified, in the highest sense, the Lord's Divine Human, He teaches in John: <p>Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. He spoke of the temple of His body (2<a href="3927/john_2_19.htm">:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_2_21.htm">21</a>) <p>and where the Lord is meant, the Word also is meant, because He is the Word. As then the interiors of the temple represented the interiors of heaven and the church, thus also of the Word, so its exteriors represented and signified the exteriors of heaven and the church, thus also of the Word, which belong to the sense of its letter. Of the exteriors of the temple we read: <p>That they were built of whole stone [unhewn] and of cedar within; and that all its walls were carved inside with cherubs and palms and open flowers; and the floor was covered with gold (<a href="3927/1-kings_6_7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_29.htm">29, 30</a>). <p>By all these things the externals of the Word, which are the holy things of the sense of its letter, are signified. </p>

221. (5) THE SAME WERE REPRESENTED BY THE EXTERNALS OF THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM.<p>This is because the temple, as well as the tabernacle, represented heaven and the Church; but the temple represented the heaven in which are spiritual angels, whereas the tabernacle represented the heaven where celestial angels are. Spiritual angels are they who are in wisdom from the Word, while celestial angels are they who are in love from the Word. That the temple at Jerusalem, in the highest sense, signified the Divine Human of the Lord, He Himself teaches in John:<p>"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up... But He spake of the temple of His body" <a href="3927/john_2_19.htm">2:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_2_21.htm">21</a>;<p>and where the Lord is meant, the Word also is meant, because He is the Word. Now, since the interior things of the temple represented the interior things of heaven and the Church, thus also of the Word, therefore its exterior things represented and signified the exterior things of heaven and the Church, thus also the exterior things of the Word, which are the sense of its Letter. Concerning the exterior things of the temple it is written:<p> they were built of stone, whole and unhewn, and of cedar within; and that all its walls were carved with cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; and that the floor was overlaid with gold. <a href="3927/1-kings_6_7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_29.htm">29-30</a>.<p>By all these things are also signified the externals of the Word, which are the holy things of the sense of its Letter. </p>

221. V. QUOD PARITER PER EXTERNA TEMPLI HIEROSOLYMITANI, est causa, quia per Templum aeque ac per Tabernaculum repraesentatum est Coelum et Ecclesia, sed per Templum Coelum in quo sunt Angeli spirituales, at per Tabernaculum Coelum ubi sunt Angeli coelestes; Angeli spirituales sunt qui in Sapientia ex Verbo sunt, Angeli coelestes autem qui in Amore ex Verbo sunt. Quod per Templum Hierosolymitanum in supremo Sensu significatum sit Divinum Humanum Domini, docet Ipse apud Johannem, Solvite Templum hoc, et in Tribus diebus exsuscitabo illud; Ipse loquebatur de TEMPLO CORPORIS SUI, <a href="3927/john_2_19.htm">2:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_2_21.htm">21</a>; et ubi intelligitur Dominus, etiam intelligitur Verbum, quia Ipse est Verbum. Nunc quia per Interiora Templi repraesentata sunt Interiora Coeli et Ecclesiae, ita quoque Verbi, ideo per Exteriora ejus etiam repraesentata et significata sunt Exteriora Coeli et Ecclesiae, ita quoque Verbi, quae Sensus literae ejus sunt. De Exterioribus Templi legitur, Quod aedificata sint ex Lapide integro non Caeso, et ex Cedro intus; et quod omnes Parietes ejus intus sculpti essent Cherubis, Palmis, et Aperturis florum; et quod Solum obductum esset auro, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_7.htm">1 Regnum 6:7</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_29.htm">29-30</a>; <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
