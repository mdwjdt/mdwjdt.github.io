<p>
511. As for the point that the church does not exist within us until the sins inside us have been removed, this is something anyone can conclude through the use of reason.
<p>It can also be illustrated through the following comparisons. No one can pasture flocks of sheep, goats, and lambs in fields or woodlands that are already occupied by all kinds of predatory animals, without first driving away the predators. No one can turn land that is full of thornbushes, brambles, and stinging nettles into a garden without first uprooting those harmful plants. No one can go into a city that is occupied by hostile enemy forces, set up a new administration devoted to justice and judgment, and make it a good place for citizens to live without first expelling the enemy. It is similar with the evils that are inside us. They are like predatory animals, brambles and thornbushes, and enemies. The church could no more live alongside them than we could live in a cage full of tigers and leopards; or lie down in a bed whose sheets were lined, and pillows stuffed, with poisonous plants; or sleep at night in a church building under whose stone floor there are tombs with dead bodies in them - would we not be harassed there by ghosts that were like the furies? </p>

</h4>
<p>
511. The church cannot exist in any person until his sins have been distanced from him. Any reasonable person can reach this conclusion, and it can be illustrated by the following comparisons. Can anyone put sheep, kids or lambs into fields or woods teeming with all kinds of wild beasts, before driving out the wild beasts? Can anyone work over a piece of ground thick with thorns, briars and nettles to make a garden, until he has uprooted those weeds? Can anyone introduce a form of government based upon justice or set up an independent state in a city occupied by an enemy, until he has driven the enemy out? It is much the same with the evils in a person, which resemble wild beasts, briars and thorns, or enemies. The church can no more co-exist with these than anyone can live together with tigers and leopards in a zoo. No more can anyone sleep in a bed made on a layer of poisonous plants or with the pillows stuffed with them. No more can anyone sleep at night in a church, if beneath its paving stones lie tombs full of corpses. He would surely be at the mercy of ghosts resembling furies. </p>

<p>
511. That the church is not in man until the sins in him have been put away, anyone may conclude from reason, and it may be illustrated by the following comparisons: Who can introduce sheep, and kids and lambs into fields or woods where there are all kinds of wild beasts, before he has driven out the beasts? Who can make a garden out of a piece of ground that is overgrown with thorns, briars, and nettles, before he has rooted out those noxious weeds? Who can establish a mode of administering justice according to judicial practices in a city held by hostile forces, and establish citizenship, before he has expelled those forces? It is the same with evils in man. They are like wild beasts, like thorns and briars, and like hostile forces; and the church can no more have a common abode with evils than a man can dwell in a cage where there are tigers and leopards; or sleep in a bed with poisonous herbs strewed upon it and stuffed into the pillows; or sleep at night in a church, beneath the floor of which are sepulchres containing dead bodies. Would not ghosts infest him there like furies? </p>

<p>
511. One may reasonably suppose that a man has not the Church in him before his sins are removed; and this may be illustrated by the following comparisons. No one can place sheep, kids and lambs in fields or woods where there are all kinds of wild beasts, until he has first driven out these beasts. No one can make a garden of ground that is over-run with thorns, briars and nettles until he has rooted out these noxious weeds. No one can introduce into a city still held by the enemy, a just and lawful administration, and set up a civil government until he has expelled the enemy. The case is similar with respect to a man's evils; for they are like wild beats, like briars and thorns, and like enemies. With these, the Church could no more have a common abode than a man could dwell in a cage with tigers and leopards; or lie on a couch over which poisonous plants had been strewn and stuffed into the pillows; or sleep soundly all night in a church beneath the floor of which were graves with their corpses. The spectres there would infest him like so many furies. </p>

511. Quod apud hominem non prius Ecclesia sit, quam postquam apud illum remota sunt peccata, quisque potest ex ratione concludere, et haec potest illustrari per has comparationes; quis potest in campos aut sylvas, in quibus sunt ferae omnis generis, introducere oves, haedos et agnos, antequam feras expulerit: et quis potest aliquam terram, spinis, sentibus et urticis obsitam praeparare in Hortum, priusquam illas noxas exstirpaverit: quis potest in Urbem ab hostibus possessam inferre formam administrationis justitiae ex judicio, et civitatem condere, priusquam hostes ejecerit: simile est cum malis apud hominem, quae sunt sicut ferae, sicut sentes et spinae, et sicut hostes, cum quibus Ecclesia non cohabitare potest plus quam quis potest habitare in Bestiario ubi sunt tigrides et leopardi; nec plus quam quis potest cubare in lecto, cui herbae toxicatae sunt substratae, ac pulvinaribus insertae; neque plus quam quis potest noctu dormire in Templo, sub cujus pavimento sunt sepulcra in quibus cadavera; numne illum ibi spectra sicut furiae infestarent. </p>
