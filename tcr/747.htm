747. Then the angel led them to the home where the wedding was to occur. A doorkeeper opened the door. Just beyond the entrance they were greeted and welcomed by an angel who had been posted there by the bridegroom. They were introduced and taken to seats reserved for them.
<p>Soon they were invited to come into a large room that adjoined the wedding bedroom. They saw a table in the middle of the large room, which had a magnificent candelabra on it with seven golden branches and cups. Suspended along the walls there were lamps made of silver. Once the lamps were lit, the light they cast gave the whole atmosphere a golden tinge. The guests also noticed two tables on either side of the candelabra, which were laid out with little loaves of bread in three rows. In the four corners of the room there were tables with crystal goblets.
</p>
<p>
[2] As they were looking over all these things, a door opened from a room next to the wedding bedroom. Six young women came out, followed by the bridegroom and the bride holding hands and leading each other to a love seat that was set up near the candelabra. The couple sat down on it, the bridegroom on the left, and the bride on his right. The six young women stood beside the bride's side of the love seat.
<p>The bridegroom was wearing a robe of gleaming purple and a tunic of shining linen. He was also wearing an ephod with a golden brooch edged in diamonds. On the brooch was carved a young eagle, the wedding insignia of that community of heaven. The bridegroom's head was covered with a turban.
<p>The bride was wearing a red robe over an embroidered gown that was all of one piece from her neck to her feet. Around her waist she had a golden sash, and on her head a crown of gold with rubies in it.
</p>
<p>
[3] When the couple had taken their seats, the bridegroom turned to the bride and placed a gold ring on her finger. Then he brought out bracelets and a necklace of pearls. He fastened the bracelets on her wrists and the necklace around her neck, and said, "Please accept these gifts as tokens of my love. " When she accepted them, he kissed her and said, "Now you are mine," and called her his wife.
<p>At that, the wedding guests cried out, "Let there be a blessing!" Each one cried it individually at first, and then all said it together. A delegate sent by the prince cried out the same thing when it was his turn. At that very moment the room was filled with sweet-smelling smoke, which was a sign of a blessing from heaven.
<p>Then servants picked up the little loaves of bread from the two tables by the candelabra, and took the crystal goblets, which were now full of wine, from the tables in the corners. They gave each guest her or his own little loaf of bread and goblet of wine, and they all ate and drank.
<p>Then the husband and wife stood up to leave. The six young women followed them, carrying in their hands little silver lamps, which were now lit; they went just as far as the threshold. The married pair went on into the wedding bedroom and closed the door. </p>

747. After this the angel took them to the house where the wedding was, and the door-keeper opened the door to them. When they had crossed the threshold, they were at once greeted by an angel the bridegroom had sent, and they were taken inside and shown to the places allotted to them. Then they were invited into an antechamber, where they saw in the middle of the room a table, on which was placed a magnificent lamp-stand, equipped with seven branches and cups made of gold. Attached to the walls were silver sconces, and the lights from all of these made a golden glow. Beside the lamp-stand they saw two tables, on which were arranged loaves in three rows, and in the four corners of the room were tables with goblets of crystal.</p>
<p>
[2] While they were looking at these, the door of the next room was thrown open, and they saw six maidens coming out followed by the bridegroom and the bride. They were holding hands, and they led each other to a seat set near the lamp-stand. They sat down on this, the bridegroom on the left and the bride on his right; and the six maidens took up a position beside the seat near the bride. The bridegroom was dressed in a mantle of gleaming purple and a tunic of shining linen with an ephod, on which was a golden plate set with a surround of diamonds. An egret was engraved upon this plate, the wedding emblem of this community. His head was covered with a mitre. The bride wore a red cloak over an embroidered gown falling from neck to foot, with a golden girdle below the bust; on her head she had a crown of gold set with rubies.</p>
<p>
[3] When they had taken their places, the bridegroom turned to the bride and put a gold ring on her finger. Then he took out bracelets and a pearl necklace, and fastening the bracelets above her wrists and the necklace around her neck, he said: 'Accept these pledges.' As she accepted them, he kissed her and said: 'Now you are mine,' and he called her his wife.<p>When he did this, all the guests cried: 'A blessing on you'. Each said this individually, and then they all called it out together. Someone who had been sent by the prince to represent him also called this out; and at that instant the ante-chamber was filled with the fragrant smoke of incense, a sign of blessing from heaven. Then the attendants took the bread from the two tables next to the lamp-stand, and the goblets, which were now full of wine, from the tables in the corners, and gave each guest bread and a goblet; so they ate and drank. After this the husband and his wife rose and were followed by the six maidens with silver lamps in their hands, now lit, as far as the threshold. So the married couple entered the bridal chamber, and the door was shut. </p>

747. After this the angel led them to the house of the wedding, and the porter opened the doors; and as soon as they had crossed the threshold they were received and saluted by an angel sent from the bridegroom, and conducted in and taken to seats set apart for them. Presently they were invited into the ante-room of the bridal chamber, in the center of which they saw a table, whereon was placed a magnificent candlestick with seven golden branches and bowls; on the walls hung lamps of silver, the burning of which gave the atmosphere a golden appearance. On each side of the candlestick they saw a table on which loaves of bread were set in triple order; and in the four corners of the room were tables upon which were crystal goblets.
</p>
<p>
[2] While they were examining these things, behold a door was opened from a room next to the bridal chamber, and they saw six virgins coming out followed by the bridegroom and bride holding each other by the hand, and leading each other to their seat which had been placed directly opposite the candlestick. On this they seated themselves, the bridegroom on the left and the bride on his right, and the six virgins standing at the side of the seat near the bride. The bridegroom was dressed in a robe of glowing purple and a coat of shining white linen, with an ephod on which was a golden plate set around with diamonds; and on the plate was engraved a young eagle, the nuptial emblem of that heavenly society. The head of the bridegroom was covered with a miter. The bride was dressed in a scarlet cloak, and under it an embroidered garment, reaching from the neck to the feet; around her waist was a golden belt and on her head a crown of gold set with rubies.
</p>
<p>
[3] While they thus sat together, the bridegroom turned to the bride and placed on her finger a golden ring, and drew forth bracelets and a necklace of pearls, fastening the bracelets on her wrists and the necklace about her neck, and saying, "Accept these pledges;" and as she accepted them, he kissed her and said, "Now you are mine," and called her his wife. <p>When this had been done the guests cried out, "Blessings on you;" each one first saying this separately, and then all together; and one sent to represent the prince also said it; and at that moment the ante-chamber was filled with an aromatic smoke, which was a sign of blessing from heaven. <p>Then the attendants took loaves from the two tables near the candlestick, and cups now filled with wine from the tables in the corners, and gave to each guest his loaf and his cup; and they ate and drank. <p>After this the husband and his wife arose, the six virgins following them to the threshold with the now lighted silver lamps in their hands; and the married pair entered the bridal chamber, and the door was closed. </p>

747. The angel then conducted them to the house where the wedding was to be celebrated, and the porter opened the door. Presently on crossing the threshold they were received and greeted by an angel sent by the bridegroom. On being introduced they were conducted to seats appointed for them. After some time they were invited into the anteroom of the bridal chamber. In the centre of this room they saw a table on which was placed a magnificent lampstand with seven branches and bowls of gold; and on the walls hung lamps of silver; and when these were lighted the atmosphere appeared lit up with a golden glow. On either side of the lampstand they saw two tables, on which were leaves placed in three rows; and in the four corners of the room there were tables upon which were crystal cups.</p>
<p>
[2] While they were looking at these things the door of an apartment next the bridal chamber opened, and they saw six maidens come out, followed by the bridegroom and the bride hand in hand. Proceeding towards a seat facing the lampstand they sat down, the bridegroom on the left and the bride on the right; and the six maidens stood by the seat near the bride. The bridegroom wore a robe of gleaming purple and a tunic of shining linen, with an ephod on which was a golden plate set around with diamonds; and on the plate was engraved an eaglet, the marriage emblem of that heavenly society and he had a mitre on his head. The bride wore a scarlet mantle, and beneath it an embroidered gown, reaching from her neck to her feet; and round her waist she had a golden girdle, and on her head a golden crown set with rubies.</p>
<p>
[3] When they were thus seated, the bridegroom turned to the bride and put a golden ring upon her finger. Then he took bracelets and a collar of pearls; and placing the bracelets upon her arms and the collar round her neck, he said, "Accept these pledges." And, as she accepted them, he kissed her and said, "Now you are mine;" and he called her his wife. On this the guests called out, "A blessing be upon you!" these words being said first by each separately, and afterwards by all together. A deputy sent by the prince joined in wishing them well; and at that moment the ante-chamber was filled with a fragrant incense, which was a token of blessing from heaven. Then the servants took bread from the tables near the lampstand, and cups filled with wine from the tables at the corners of the room, and gave to each of the guests bread and a cup; and they ate and drank. After this the husband and his wife rose, and the six maidens attended them to the threshold with the silver lamps, now lighted, in their hands. So the married pair entered the bridal-chamber and the door was closed. </p>

747. Post haec duxit Angelus illos ad Domum nuptiarum, et janitor aperuit fores; et mox intra limen recepti et salutati ab Angelo misso a Sponso, ac introducti sunt, et adducti ad sedes pro illis designatas; et mox invitati in Antithalamum, ubi viderunt in medio Mensam, super qua positum erat magnificum Candelabrum instructum septem calamis et schyphis ex auro; et ad parietes pendebant Lychnaria ex argento; ex quibus accensis apparuit athmosphaera sicut aurea: et viderunt ad latera Candelabri binas Mensas, super quibus in triplici ordine repositi erant Panes; et in quatuor angulis Mensas, super quibus erant Cyathi chrystallini.</p>
<p>
[2] Dum illa lustrabant, ecce aperiebatur janua e conclavi juxta thalamum, et viderunt sex Virgines exeuntes, et post illas Sponsum et Sponsam, tenentes se manibus, et ducentes se ad Solium, quod e regione Candelabri positum erat, super quo se reposuerunt, Sponsus ad sinistram, et Sponsa ad dextram ejus, et sex virgines constiterunt ad latus solii juxta Sponsam. Sponsus indutus erat Pallio ex purpura lucente, et Tunica ex bysso splendente, cum Ephodo, super quo erat bractea aurea adamantibus circumobsita; et bracteae insculptus erat Pullus aquilae, insigne nuptiale hujus societatis coeli; et Sponsi caput tegebat cidaris: Sponsa autem amicta erat chlamyde coccinea, et sub illa toga acupicta, continua a collo ad pedes, et sub pectore zona aurea, et super capite corona ex auro cum insitis rubinis.</p>
<p>
[3] Cum ita consederunt, convertit se Sponsus ad Sponsam, ac imposuit digito ejus annulum aureum, et deprompsit armillas et collarium ex unionibus, et alligabat armillas super poplites manuum ejus, et collarium circum collum ejus, et dixit, accipe haec pignora; et dum illa accepit, osculatus est illam, et dixit, nunc mea es, et vocavit illam suam uxorem. Hoc facto clamaverunt invitati, sit Benedictio; hoc clamavit quisque per se, et dein omnes simul; unus a Principe missus vice ejus etiam acclamavit; et eo momento implebatur Antithalamus illo fumo aromatico, quod erat signum benedictionis e coelo: et tunc ministri ex duabus mensis juxta Candelabrum sumserunt Panes, et ex mensis in angulis Cyathos nunc vino impletos, et dederunt cuivis invitato suum panem et suum cyathum, ac ederunt et biberunt. Post haec surrexerunt Maritus et ejus Uxor, sequentibus sex virginibus cum argenteis nunc accensis lampadibus in manibus usque ad limen; ac Conjuges intraverunt Thalamum; et clausa est janua. </p>
