<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第363节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>363</b>. 不过，为了使关于信的这一条（即主、仁、信合为一体，正如人的生命、意愿、理解力合为一体；若它们分开，各自会象珍珠化为粉末一样消失）能被视为真理并得到承认，有必要按下列次序予以讨论：<br />⑴主以其全部的圣爱、全部的圣智，因而全部的神性生命流入每个人。<br />⑵祂同样以信与仁的全部本质流入每个人。<br />⑶不过，人对这些的接受取决于他的形式。<br />⑷然而，将主、仁与信分割之人并非接受它们的形式，确切地说，是摧毁它们的形式。</p>

363. 我們回到本節的觀點:主,義與信成為一, 正如人的生命,意志與認知為一; 如果分開, 各自崩潰如同珍珠碎為粉末。為了明白並接受這個真理, 有必要按以下次序逐一討論:
<p>(1)主以祂全部的聖仁,全部的聖智以及祂全部的神性生命流注入每一個人。
<p>(2)因此主以信和義的全部本質流注入每一個人。
<p>(3)人接受它們的情形取決於他的形式。
<p>(4)然而, 將主,義與信分割之人並非接受它們的形式, 而是它們的摧毀者。 </p>

363. Now to the current point about faith - namely, that the Lord, goodwill, and faith form a unity in the same way our life, our will, and our intellect form a unity; and if we separate them, each one crumbles like a pearl that is crushed to powder. To see and acknowledge the truth of this, it is important to consider it in the following order:
<p>a. The Lord flows into everyone with all his divine love, all his divine wisdom, and all his divine life.
<p>b. Therefore the Lord flows into everyone with the entire essence of faith and goodwill.
<p>c. These qualities are received by us according to our form.
<p>d. If we separate the Lord, goodwill, and faith, however, instead of being a form that accepts these qualities we are a form that destroys them. </p>

<p>
363. However, so that this article of faith - that the Lord, charity and faith make one, just as in a person life, will and understanding do, and if they are divided, each of them is destroyed, like a pearl collapsing into dust - may be seen and recognised as truth, it needs to be discussed in the following sequence.<p>(i) The Lord flows into every human being with all His Divine love, all His Divine wisdom, and so with all His Divine life.<p>(ii) He does this likewise with the whole essence of faith and charity.<p>(iii) But how these are received by the person depends upon his form.<p>(iv) The person, however, who separates the Lord, charity and faith is not a form which can receive them, but rather one which destroys them. </p>

<p>
363. But in order that the present article on faith (which is, that the Lord, charity, and faith make one, like life, will, and understanding in man, and that if they are divided each perishes like a pearl reduced to powder) may be seen as truth and acknowledged, it is expedient to consider it in the following order: <p>(1) The Lord with all of His Divine love, with all of His Divine wisdom, thus with all of His Divine life, flows into every man. <p>(2) Consequently with the whole essence of faith and charity. <p>(3) These are received by man according to his form. <p>(4) But the man who divides the Lord, charity, and faith, is not a form that receives but a form that destroys them. </p>

<p>
363. In order that the truth of this article of faith may be seen and acknowledged, namely, that the Lord, charity and faith make one, like life, will and understanding in man; and that if they are divided, each perishes like a pearl reduced to powder, it will be expedient to consider it under the following heads:<p>(1) The Lord, with all His Divine Love, and with all His Divine Wisdom, thus with all His Divine Life, enters by influx into every man;<p>(2) Consequently, with all the essence of faith and charity;<p>(3) But they are received by man according to his form.<p>(4) The man, however, who separates the Lord, charity and faith, is a form not recipient but destructive of them. </p>

363. Ut autem hic Articulus fidei, qui est, quod Dominus, Charitas et Fides, unum faciant, sicut Vita, Voluntas et Intellectus in homine, et quod si dividuntur unumquodvis pereat, sicut unio dilapsa in pollinem, ut veritas videatur et agnoscatur, interest ut in hoc ordine expendatur, I. Quod Dominus cum omni Divino suo amore, cum omni Divina sua Sapientia, ita cum omni Divina sua Vita influat apud omnem hominem. II. Proinde cum omni Essentia Fidei et Charitatis, III. Sed quod illa recipiantur ab homine secundum ejus formam. IV. Quod autem homo qui dividit Dominum, Charitatem et Fidem, non sit Forma recipiens, sed Forma destruens illa. </p>
