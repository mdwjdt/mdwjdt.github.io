<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第146节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>146</b>.（3）差圣灵所表示的神性大能和活动，尤其对神职人员而言，是指启示和教导。前一节列举了主的作工，也就是说，改造、重生、更新、复活、成圣、称义、洁净、赦罪，以及最终的救赎从主流入，以影响神职人员和平信徒，被那些在主里面，并且主也在他们里面之人所接受（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.56.htm">约翰福音6:56</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">14:20</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.4.htm">15:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.5.htm">5</a>）。启示和教导尤其被赋予神职人员，这是因为这些是他们职责的一部分，神职人员的就职就带有这些东西。而且，在热情传道时，他们相信自己受到启示，就象主的门徒那样，祂向门徒吹气说：<br />你们受圣灵。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.22.htm">约翰福音20:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.11.htm">马可福音13:11</a>）<br />有些神职人员甚至声称，他们曾感觉圣灵流入到自己里面。不过，他们要格外小心，不要认定很多人在讲道时所具有的那种热情就是在他们心里作工的神。因为狂热者，以及那些信奉虚假教义者，甚至那些根本不在乎圣言，而是拜自然为神，将仁与信放在后背的布袋里之人也有类似热情，甚至更强烈。他们在讲道和教导时，便把这个布袋挂在脖子上，好像他们的另一个胃，然后从中汲取诸如他们所知道的能吊起听众胃口之类的东西，并进行倒嚼。就本身而言，热情是属世人之热的爆发。若这种热情有对真理的爱在其中，那它就像降临到使徒身上的圣火，如使徒行传所描述的那样：<br />又有舌头如火焰显现出来，在他们当中分开，散落在他们各人头上；他们就都被圣灵充满。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/徒2.3.htm">使徒行传2:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/徒2.4.htm">4</a>）<br />但是，若这种热情，或热的爆发有对虚假的爱潜伏其中，那它就像木头里阴燃的火，会迸发出来，烧毁房屋。读者们，你们若否认圣言的圣洁和主的神性，那我请求你们取下你们背上的布袋，将它打开，如你们私下里所做的那样，然后就会明白。我知道，那些属于巴别，也就是以赛亚书中路西弗所表示的人，一进入教会，尤其一登上讲坛（特别是那些自称耶稣会成员的人）就会被这种热情冲走，对很多人来说，这种热情源于地狱之爱。他们因这种热情，比那些其热情出于天堂之爱的人呼叫得更激烈，从胸中发出的叹息更深重。神职人员中还有另外两种属灵的作工，这在下文会提到（155节）。</p>

146. (3)對於聖職人員, 神性活動和強大作用表示通過"聖靈的發送"來啟發和指導的作為。
<p>在以上部分所列舉的主的活動——改造,更新,復興,帶來生命,成聖,稱義,潔淨,赦罪, 最終拯救。這些活動由主發出, 流向無論聖職,還是平民; 凡在主裡面,主在他裡面的人都能接收到這些活動(<a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">約翰福音6:56</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">14:20</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">15:4-5</a>)。
<p>不過, 對於聖職人員, 主還有另外的活動作用於他們:啟發與指導。啟發與指導之所以特別作用于聖職人員, 是因為被啟發與受教導是他們職責的一部分, 從授職到服事一直伴隨。
<p>聖職人員還相信, 當他們熱心傳道時, 就像主向門徒們吹氣那樣會受啟示, 祂說:"你們受聖靈"(<a href="3927/john_20_22.htm">約翰福音20:22</a>; John 20: 還有<a href="3927/mark_13_11.htm">馬可福音13:11</a>)。有些聖職人員甚至聲稱, 他們感受過這樣的注入。
<p>不過他們當萬分注意, 不要自我確信傳道時突發的熱情就是上帝在他們心裡工作。這樣的,甚至更加激烈的熱情會在狂熱盲信者身上發現, 他們也相信得著神性的啟示。還會出現在那些持極端偽謬教訓者身上。甚至那些無視聖言價值並尊崇自然為上帝的人身上也有這樣的激情, 他們把信與義扔進背上的背包裡。當他們講道或教導時, 把包轉過來吊在脖子上,就像另一個胃, 從那裡嘔出那些東西反芻, 他們知道哪些東西吸引聽眾的胃口。
<p>對屬世之人, 講道時的熱情只是一時的爆發。如果是對真理渴望的熱情, 就會如同聖火流入到使徒們當中, 正如我們讀『使徒行傳』所說:有舌頭像火焰一樣,向他們顯現出來, 分散而停在他們每一個人上頭; 於是眾人都充滿了聖靈(<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_2_3.htm">使徒行傳2:3-4</a>)。
<p>另外一面, 如果熱情或爆發之中所含的只是對偽謬的渴望, 那就會一根木頭燒得冒煙, 串出火頭燒倒房屋。
<p>讀者們, 如果你否認聖言的神聖和主的神性, 請取下你的背包,打開看看(當你在家時, 可自由行動), 你將會明白。
<p>我知道那些來自巴比倫之人,就是『以賽亞書』中路西弗所指的, 特別是那些稱自己為"耶穌會"的, 當他們一走進教會, 在他們踏上講臺的臺階時更是被熱情征服, 在許多情況下, 這樣的熱情來自於地獄之愛。這讓他們比那些有來自天國之愛的熱情, 發出更激烈地呼叫,從胸腔發中更深長的歎息。
<p>在聖職人員之中, 主還有另外兩樣屬靈的行動, 見接下來的第<a href="155.htm">155</a>節。 </p>

146. 3. In respect to the clergy, the divine actions and powerful effects meant by "the sending of the Holy Spirit" are the acts of enlightening and teaching. The actions of the Lord listed in the preceding point - reforming, regenerating, renewing, bringing to life, sanctifying, justifying, purifying, forgiving sins, and finally saving - flow from the Lord into both clergy and lay people. These actions are accepted by those who are in the Lord and in whom the Lord is (<a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">John 6:56</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">14:20</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">15:4-5</a>).
<p>In the case of the clergy, however, there are other actions of the Lord as well: enlightening and teaching. The reason is that for ministers, being enlightened and taught is a part of their jobs that comes with their inauguration into the ministry.
<p>Also, when ministers preach with passion they believe they are inspired, just like the Lord's disciples on whom the Lord breathed and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (<a href="3927/john_20_22.htm">John 20:22</a>; see also what <a href="3927/mark_13_11.htm">Mark 13:11</a> says). Some ministers even maintain that they have felt an inflow.
<p>Ministers have to be very careful, though, not to convince themselves that the passion that comes over many of them when they preach is God at work in their hearts. The same level of passion and an even more ardent one is found in fanatics who believe they are divinely inspired, in people who have the falsest teachings, and even in people who see no value in the Word and worship nature as their god, who toss faith and goodwill into packs on their backs. When they preach and teach they hang these packs in front of their faces like some ruminatory stomach, squeezing and regurgitating out of them things they know will feed their listeners.
<p>Passion in preaching is just an intensity in the earthly self. If passion has a love for truth inside it, then it is like the sacred fire that flowed into the apostles, about which it says in Acts:
<p>There appeared to them divided tongues as of fire, and one rested on each one of them. As a result they were all filled with the Holy Spirit. (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_2_3.htm">Acts of the Apostles 2:3-4</a>)
<p>If, on the other hand, there is a love for falsity inside that passion or intensity, then it is like fire smoldering inside a piece of wood that bursts into flame and burns the house down.
<p>You who deny that the Word is holy and the Lord divine, please take your pack off your back and open it (as you freely do when you are at home). You will see.
<p>When they enter the church, and even more when they climb the stairs into the pulpit, I know that the people meant by Lucifer in Isaiah - the people of Babylon, especially those who named themselves the Society of Jesus - are overcome with passion. For many of them that passion comes from a hellish love. They raise their voices more vehemently and draw sighs from their chests more deeply than those whose passion comes from a heavenly love.
<p>There are also two other spiritual actions of the Lord in members of the clergy; see 155 below. </p>

<p>
146. (iii) THE DIVINE POWER AND ACTIVITY MEANT BY THE SENDING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, WITH THE CLERGY TAKES THE PARTICULAR FORM OF ENLIGHTENMENT AND INSTRUCTION.<p>The activities of the Lord listed in the preceding section, reformation, regeneration, renewal, quickening, sanctification, justification, cleansing, the forgiveness of sins and finally salvation, are sent by the Lord to affect the clergy as well as laymen, and they are received by those who are in the Lord and have the Lord in them (<a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">John 6:56</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">14:20</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">15:4-5</a>). The reason why enlightenment and instruction are especially given to the clergy is that these things are a part of their duties, and that ordination into the ministry carries these with it. The clergy also believe that, when zeal leads them to preach, they are inspired like the Lord's disciples, on whom He breathed and said:<p>Receive the Holy Spirit, <a href="3927/john_20_22.htm">John 20:22</a>; see also <a href="3927/mark_13_11.htm">Mark 13:11</a>.<p>Some even assert that they have felt it flowing into them. But they should take extreme care not to be convinced that the zeal, by which many are carried away while preaching, is God working in their hearts. For similar or even more ardent zeal is felt by fanatics and also by those who hold the falsest doctrines, even by those who care not a whit for the Word, but worship nature as god, and pack faith and charity away in the knapsack on their backs. When they are preaching and teaching they hang it round their necks like a sort of second stomach, from which they bring up and regurgitate such things as they know will appeal to their listeners' appetites.<p>Zeal considered in itself is an outburst of heat in the natural man. If it has the love of truth in it, then it is like the holy fire which affected the Apostles, as we read in Acts:<p>There appeared divided among them tongues as it were of fire, which settled upon each of them; and they were thus all filled with the Holy Spirit, <a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_2_3.htm">Acts of the Apostles 2:3-4</a>.<p>But if that zeal or outburst of heat has the love of falsity lurking within it, then it is like fire smouldering in a log, which bursts out and sets fire to the house. Do you, reader, if you deny the holiness of the Word and the divinity of the Lord, please take your knapsack off your back and open it, which you are free to do at home, and then you will see. I know that those from Babel, who are meant by Lucifer in Isaiah, on entering a church, and even more when climbing into a pulpit, especially those who call themselves members of the Society of Jesus, are carried away by a zeal which in many cases comes from a hellish love; and this makes them cry out more violently and heave deeper sighs from their chests, than those whose zeal comes from heavenly love. There are two more ways in which the spirit works upon the clergy, which will be mentioned later (155). </p>

146. (3) The Divine Energy and Operation, which are meant by the "sending of the Holy Spirit" are, with the clergy especially, enlightenment and instruction. The operations of the Lord enumerated in the preceding proposition, namely, reformation, regeneration, renewal, vivification, sanctification, justification, purification, the forgiveness of sins, and finally salvation, flow in from the Lord both with the clergy and the laity, and are received by those who are in the Lord, and in whom the Lord is (<a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">John 6:56</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">14:20</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">15:4, 5</a>). But enlightenment and instruction are communicated especially to the clergy, because these belong to their office, and inauguration into the ministry carries these along with it. Moreover, when preaching from zeal they believe themselves to be inspired, like the Lord's disciples upon whom He breathed, saying: <p>Receive ye the Holy Spirit (<a href="3927/john_20_22.htm">John 20:22</a>; see also <a href="3927/mark_13_11.htm">Mark 13:11</a>). <p>Some affirm even that they have felt the influx. But they should be very careful not to persuade themselves that the zeal by which many are carried away while preaching is the Divine operation in their hearts; for a like and even warmer zeal prevails with enthusiasts, as also with those who are in the utmost falsities of doctrine; and even with those who despise the Word and worship nature instead of God, and fling faith and charity, as it were, into a bag on the back; but when preaching or teaching they hang it before them like a sort of ruminatory stomach, from which they draw out and disgorge such things as they know will serve as food for their hearers. For zeal, in itself considered, is a glow of the natural man. If it has within it a love of truth it is like the sacred fire that descended upon the apostles, as described in the Acts: <p>There appeared unto them tongues parting asunder, like as of fire; and it sat upon each of them; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_2_3.htm">Acts of the Apostles 2:3-4</a>). <p>But if within that zeal or glow a love of falsity is concealed, it is like a fire imprisoned in wood, which bursts forth and consumes the house. You who deny the holiness of the Word and the Divinity of the Lord, take, I pray, the bag from your back and open it, as you freely do in your privacy, and you will see. I know that those who are meant by "Lucifer" in Isaiah, who are such as belong to Babylon, when they enter a church, and still more when they ascend the pulpit (especially those who call themselves members of the Society of Jesus), are swept away by a zeal which with many springs from infernal love, and from it declaim more vehemently, and from their breasts draw deeper sighs, than those who are zealous from heavenly love. With the clergy there are two other spiritual operations (as may be seen below, n. <a href="155.htm">155</a>). </p>

146. (3) THE DIVINE VIRTUE AND OPERATION, MEANT BY THE SENDING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WITH THE CLERGY CONSIST, IN PARTICULAR, IN ENLIGHTENMENT AND INSTRUCTION.<p>The operations of the Lord, enumerated in the previous article, namely, reformation, regeneration, renewal, vivification, sanctification, justification, purification, the remission of sins, and finally salvation, are effected by influx from the Lord in both clergy and laity; and are received by those who are in the Lord, and who have the Lord in them,<p><a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">John 6:56</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">14:20</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">15:4-5</a>.<p>However, the clergy in particular receive enlightenment and instruction because these relate to their office, inauguration into the ministry brings them with it. They believe, moreover, that when they preach with zeal, they are inspired, like the Lord's disciples, on whom He breathed, saying:<p>"Receive ye the Holy Spirit" <a href="3927/john_20_22.htm">John 20:22</a>. See also <a href="3927/mark_13_11.htm">Mark 13:11</a>.<p>Some declare that, they have perceived the influx. But they ought to be very careful not to persuade themselves that the zeal which takes hold of many when preaching is the Divine operation in their hearts. For a similar and even more ardent zeal prevails with fanatics, and with those whose doctrines are false in the extreme, who lightly esteem the Word, and who worship nature instead of God. They also cast faith and charity, as it were, into a bag behind their back; but when they preach and teach, they hold it in front of them, like a ruminatory stomach, from which they draw out and disgorge what they know will serve as food for their hearers.<p>Zeal, regarded in itself, is intense ardor of the natural man. If there is in it the love of truth, then it is like the sacred fire which flowed into the Apostles, as is thus described in the Acts:<p>"And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit" <a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_2_3.htm">Acts 2:3-4</a>.<p>However, if the love of falsity lies concealed within that zeal or intense ardor, it is then like fire imprisoned in wood, which bursts out and burns down the house. I beseech you, who deny the sanctity of the Word and the Divinity of the Lord, take the bag off your back and open it, which you may freely do in the privacy of your own home, and you will see. I know that those who are meant by Lucifer <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
in Isaiah, and who belong to Babylon, when they enter a church, and still more when they ascend the pulpit, especially those who call themselves members of the Society of Jesus, <sup "fn9_2">2</sup>
are carried away by a zeal which with many arises from an infernal love. They make their voices resound more vehemently and they heave deeper sighs than those whose zeal arises from a heavenly love. It will be seen later in <a href="155.htm">155</a> that there are two other spiritual operations relating to the clergy in addition to enlightenment and instruction.<p>
