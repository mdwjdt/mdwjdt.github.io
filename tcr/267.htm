267. 聖言也光照教會之外和沒有聖言的人
<p>除非地上某處有教會——擁有聖言, 並藉著聖言而認識主, 否則與天國就會斷絕聯繫; 因為主是天地之上帝, 離了祂就無拯救。因為聖言提供了與主的聯繫及與天國天人們的連接, 參看<a href="234.htm">234-239</a>。哪怕只有一間擁有聖言的教會, 甚至只有很少人在這教會中, 主照樣能藉著聖言向全世界臨格, 因為聖言在天國與人類之間產生紐帶聯結之用。 </p>

267. 13. Because of the Word, Even People Who Are outside the Church and Who Do Not Have the Word Have Light.
<p>No connection to heaven is possible unless somewhere on earth there is a church where the Word exists and where the Lord is known through that Word. This is because the Lord is the God of heaven and earth - without the Lord there is no salvation. (For the Word providing a connection to the Lord and association with angels, see 234-239 above.) It is enough if there is one church where the Word exists. Even if this church consists of comparatively few people, still the Lord is present throughout the world by means of the Word, since heaven is connected to the human race through the Word. </p>

267. XIII. The Word also serves to enlighten those who are outside the church and do not possess the Word.<p>There can be no link with heaven unless somewhere on earth there is a church, which possesses the Word, and so the Lord is known because the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and without Him salvation is impossible. A link with the Lord is established by means of the Word, and so is association with angels: see <a href="234.htm">234-239</a> <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
. It is enough if there is a church which possesses the Word, even though it is composed of relatively few people, The Lord is still present by its means throughout the world, for the Word effects a link between heaven and the human race.<p>

267. XIII. THAT THROUGH THE WORD THERE IS LIGHT ALSO TO THOSE WHO ARE OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH AND DO NOT POSSESS THE WORD. <p>No conjunction with heaven is possible unless somewhere on the earth there is a church that has the Word, and by means of the Word the Lord is known; for the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and without Him there is no salvation. That conjunction with the Lord and affiliation with the angels is effected by means of the Word may be seen above (n. <a href="234.htm">234-239</a>). It is sufficient that there be a church where the Word is; and although it consist of comparatively few, the Lord nevertheless is present by means of it throughout the whole world, since by means of it there is a conjunction of heaven with the human race. </p>

267. XIII. BY MEANS OF THE WORD THOSE ALSO HAVE LIGHT WHO ARE OUTSIDE THE CHURCH, AND DO NOT POSSESS THE WORD.
<p>There cannot be conjunction with heaven unless there exists somewhere on the earth a Church in possession of the Word by means of which the Lord is known; for the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and without Him there is no salvation. That conjunction with the Lord and association with angels are effected by means of the Word, may be seen above in <a href="234.htm">234-240</a>. It is enough that there is a Church in possession of the Word, even although it should consist of comparatively few persons; nevertheless by means of the Word the Lord is present throughout the whole world, for it is the means by which conjunction is effected between heaven and the human race. </p>

267. XIII.<p>Quod per Verbum etiam sit Lux illis, qui extra Ecclesiam sunt, et non habent Verbum.<p>Non potest dari conjunctio cum Coelo, nisi alicubi in Tellure sit Ecclesia, ubi est Verbum, et per id Dominus notus, quia Dominus est Deus Coeli et Terrae, et absque Domino nulla salus: quod per Verbum sit conjunctio cum Domino, et consociatio cum Angelis, videatur supra <a href="234.htm">234-239</a>. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Satis est, ut Ecclesia sit ubi Verbum, tametsi illa sit ex paucis respective, per id usque Dominus praesens est in universo terrarum Orbe, nam per id Coelum conjunctum est Humano Generi.<p>
