<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第181节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>181</b>.或许有人会问，涌出诸如但以理书中所描述的“那行毁坏可憎的”（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.27.htm">但以理书9:27</a>），以及“从来没有，也必不再有的大灾难”（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.21.htm">马太福音24:21</a>）的源头和泉源是从哪里来的呢？答案是：它来自整个基督教界的普遍信仰，以及按照传统的教导，来自这信的流注、活动和分配。令人震惊的是，唯信称义的教义居然在众基督教会扮演主要角色。而事实上，它并非正信，只是一个妄想。也就是说，它几乎完全控制了神职人员，仿佛它是唯一的神学信条。这就是组成神职人员队伍的所有学生在学校如饥似渴地学习、吞咽并吸收的东西。后来仿佛受到上天智慧的启示，他们在教会教导它，出版有关它的书籍，以追求并获得名声、荣耀，以及学术上的称赞，还由此获得文凭、学历和奖金。这一切全都发生了，尽管如今日头因这唯信而变黑了，月亮也不放光，众星从天上坠落，天势都震动了（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.29.htm">马太福音24:29</a>）。以下这一点已向我证明了：即这信的教义如今已蒙蔽了人们的心智，以致他们不愿、因而不能在阳光或月光下从内在看到任何神圣真理，只能就着夜间的炉火之光从外在以心智的粗糙表层去观看。因此，我能预言，若有关仁与信的真正结合、天堂与地狱、主、死后生命、永恒幸福的神圣真理以银字母写成，然后从天而降，那些坚持唯信称义并成圣的人必认为它们不值一读。但是，若有关唯信称义的论文从地狱被送上来，情况就迥然不同了；他们必抓住并亲吻它，然后揣在怀里带回家。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #181 </h4>
<p>
181. 或許有人會問, 從哪裡產生但以理描述的"行毀壞可憎的"(<a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">但以理書9:27</a>)和"前所未有,不再會有的大災難"(<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">馬太福音24:21</a>)呢？答案肯定是:基督徒世界普遍所持之信, 以及如此之信如何進到信徒裡面,作用于信徒,歸算給信徒等等方面的傳統教導。更令人震驚的是, 聲稱這個信(其實並不是真正的信, 只是個妄想)是唯一使人稱義的途徑, 這樣的教義居然佔據的基督徒教會的每一寸領地。也就是說, 它統治了神職人員, 仿佛它是唯一的神學教義。那些神職人員的新丁們在他們的學校熱心學習,吞咽和消化的就是如此之信。然後, 他們如同得到屬天智慧的啟示, 在教會講壇上教導的,在書中撰寫的, 都是這樣的信。藉此, 他們追求並得到名聲,榮譽, 以及博學的光輝。因為這些, 他們獲得文憑,學位和獎勵。
<p>儘管現今就是因為這樣的信, 太陽變黑了, 月亮不放光, 眾星從天上墜落, 天勢都震動了(<a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">馬太福音24:29</a>), 但還是照舊這樣信。許多跡象證明, 如此信是何等地迷惑人們的思想, 以至於他們不想,甚至不能在陽光或月光下看到任何神性真理, 卻只能在夜晚爐火旁模糊見到外在表面之象。因此, 我能如此斷定:倘若從天上降下銀色字母寫成的關於義與信的關係,天國與地獄,主,死後生活,永生福樂方面的神性真理, 那些相信"唯信稱義與成聖"之人甚至認為這些真理不值一讀。不過, 如果是從地獄送上來的關於"唯信稱義"的書信, 那就另一碼事了, 他們會如獲至寶,親吻它並放在貼身口袋帶回家。 </p>

181. You may well ask what the source is that yields the abomination of desolation that Daniel describes (<a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>) and the affliction such as has never existed before and will never exist again (<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>). The answer you will find is the faith itself that is universal to the Christian world, together with the now traditional concepts of how that faith flows into us, acts on us, and is assigned to us. Astoundingly, the position that that faith is the only thing that justifies us (although that belief is really a fairy tale, not a faith) occupies every square inch of the Christian churches. In the Sacred Order, it rules as virtually the only theology. This position is what all candidates for the ministry eagerly learn, consume, and absorb in college. Then, as if they were people inspired with heavenly wisdom, they teach that position in churches and publish it in books. Through it they pursue and achieve the name, reputation, and glory of having superior erudition. Because of it they are given diplomas, fellowships, and awards.
<p>All this goes on despite the fact that nowadays this faith alone has darkened the sun, deprived the moon of its light, caused the stars of heaven to fall, and shaken the powers of the heavens, as the Lord foretold in <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>. I have been given absolute proof that this faith has so blinded human minds today that they do not want, and therefore are virtually unable, to see any divine truth inwardly [as if it were] in the light of either the sun or the moon. They can see it only [as if it were] reflected superficially off some rough surface in firelight at night. I can therefore make this assertion: If divine truths about the true partnership between goodwill and faith, about heaven and hell, about the Lord, about life after death, and about eternal happiness were to be written in silver letters and sent down from heaven, people who believe that we are sanctified and justified by faith alone would not even consider them worth reading. At the other extreme, though, if a paper asserting that faith alone makes us just were to be sent up from the hells, the same people would seize it, kiss it, and hold it close to their heart as they carried it home. </p>

181. The question may be asked, what is the very source and spring from which has flowed forth such an abomination of desolation, as described in Daniel (<a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>), and such an affliction as never was nor ever will be (<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>)? The answer must be that it comes from the actual faith universally held throughout the Christian world, and from its influence, activity and imputation, as traditionally taught. It is astonishing that the doctrine of justification by that faith alone plays the leading role in the Christian churches, when it is no true faith, but a chimera; that is to say, it dominates the clergy almost as if it were the only theological dogma. It is this that all the recruits to the clergy in their schools avidly learn, swallow and absorb. And afterwards, as if inspired by heavenly wisdom, this is what they teach in their pulpits, publish in their books, and use to pursue and borrow a reputation for superior learning, fame and glory. It is for this that they are presented with diplomas, degrees and prizes. And this happens despite the fact that as a result of that faith alone to-day the sun has been darkened, the moon deprived of her light, the stars have fallen from the skies, and the powers of the heavens have been shaken, as predicted by the Lord's words in Matthew (<a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>). I have been given evidence that the doctrine of that faith has to-day so blinded people's minds that they are unwilling and therefore unable to see any Divine truth inwardly in sunlight, or in moonlight, but only outwardly with its rough exterior in the light of a fire by night. Therefore I am able to prophesy that if there were sent down from heaven, written in letters of silver, the Divine truths about the true linking of charity and faith, about heaven and hell, about the Lord, about life after death and about everlasting happiness, these believers in justification and sanctification by faith alone would not judge them worth reading. But it would be quite different if a paper on justification by faith alone were sent up from hell; this they would seize on, kiss and carry off home in their pockets. </p>

181. But it may be asked, Whence is the very stream of that fountain from which has come forth an abomination of desolation such as is described in Daniel (<a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">9:27</a>), and a tribulation such as was not nor shall be (<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>)? The answer is, that it comes from that same universal faith of the Christian world, and from its influx, operation, and imputation according to traditions. Wonderful it is that the doctrine of justification by that faith alone (which, however, is no faith but only a chimera) controls every point of doctrine in Christian churches; that is, with the clerical order it rules as almost the sole theological principle. It is what all students of divinity eagerly learn in the schools and drink in and absorb; and afterwards, seemingly inspired by heavenly wisdom, they teach it in the churches and publish it in books; and by it they strive after and acquire a reputation and fame and praise for superior learning; and on account of it, diplomas, degrees, and prizes are bestowed upon them; and all this is done, although by that same faith alone the sun at this day is darkened, the moon is robbed of her light, the stars have fallen from heaven, and the powers of the heavens have been shaken, according to the words of the Lord's prophecy in Matthew (<a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">24:29</a>). It has been proved to me that the doctrine of this faith has today so darkened men's minds that they are not willing, and therefore as it were not able, to see any Divine truth inwardly, either in the light of the sun or in the light of the moon, but only outwardly on the mere rough surface by the light on a hearth at night; and I am therefore able to declare, that if Divine truths respecting the real conjunction of charity and faith, respecting heaven and hell, the Lord, life after death, and eternal happiness, were sent down from heaven written in letters of silver, those who hold to justification and sanctification by faith alone would not deem them worth reading. But it would be wholly different if a treatise on justification by faith alone were sent up from the hells; this they would receive, and would kiss it and carry it home in their bosoms. </p>

181. But the question arises, what is the actual source of the fountain from which has flowed such abomination of desolation as is described in <a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>, and such affliction as was not nor ever shall be, <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>, and the answer is, the source is that faith which universally prevails throughout the Christian world, with its influx, operation, and imputation according to the received traditions. It is astonishing that the doctrine of justification by this faith alone, although it is not a faith but a delusion, should be accounted as every thing in the Christian Churches, prevailing there with the clergy almost as the only essential of theology. All young students of Divinity in their colleges eagerly learn, drink in, and inwardly digest this doctrine; and afterwards, as though inspired with heavenly wisdom, they teach it in their churches and publish it in their books. By it they seek and acquire a reputation for superior erudition, fame and glory, and on account of it diplomas, degrees and rewards are granted to them, although by this faith alone the sun to-day is darkened, the moon is deprived of her light, the stars of heaven have fallen, and the powers of the heavens are shaken, according to the words of the Lord's prophecy in <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>. It has been made manifest to me that the doctrine of this faith has to-day blinded men's minds to such an extent that they are unwilling, and thus unable, to see any Divine truth interiorly, either by the light of the sun or of the moon, but only exteriorly, as in rough outline by the light of a fire at night. I can therefore affirm that were Divine truths concerning the genuine conjunction of charity and faith, heaven and hell, the Lord, life after death and eternal happiness sent down from heaven written in letters of silver, they would not be considered worth reading by those who maintain the doctrine of justification and sanctification by faith alone; but, on the other hand, were a treatise on justification by faith alone sent up from hell, they would receive it, embrace it and carry it home in their bosom. </p>

181. Sed quaeritur, unde est ipsa vena fontis, ex qua talis abominatio desolationis, qualis describitur apud <a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Danielem 9:27</a>, et talis afflictio qualis non fuit, nec fiet <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthaeus 24:21</a>, scaturivit; et respondetur quod ex ipsa Fide universali in Christiano Orbe, et ex ejus influxu, operatione et imputatione, secundum traditiones. Mirabile est, quod doctrina justificationis per solam illam fidem, tametsi non est fides, sed chimera, in Ecclesiis Christianis omne punctum ferat; hoc est, illa ibi paene ut unicum Theologicum in Ordine Sacro regnet; illa est, quam omnes Novitii e Clero in Lyceis avide addiscunt, hauriunt et insorbent; et postea sicut inspirati coelesti sapientia in Templis docent, in Libris vulgant, et per quam superioris eruditionis nomen, famam, et gloriam sectantur et foenerantur, ut et propter quam diplomata, auctoramenta, et praemia, donantur; et haec fiunt, tametsi per illam solam fidem hodie obscuratus est Sol, lumine suo orbata est Luna, Stellae coelorum ceciderunt, et Virtutes coelorum commotae sunt, secundum verba praedictionis a Domino apud <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">Matthaeum 24:29</a> quod doctrina istius fidei hodie occaecaverit mentes in tantum, ut non velint, et inde sicut non possint, videre aliquod Divinum Verum intus in luce solis, nec in luce lunae, sed modo extus in quadam scabra superficie in luce foci noctu, testatum mihi factum est; quare possum vaticinari, quod si Divina Vera de genuina conjunctione <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
