<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第3节 圣言的字义是其属灵和属天之义的基础、容器和支撑</h4><br />210.一切神性事物都有一个最初，一个中间和一个最末；最初经由中间进入最末，从而存在和持续存在；因此，最末是它的基础。最初也存在于中间，并经由中间而存在于最末。最末是一个容器；它因是一个容器和基础，故也是一个支撑。有学问的读者都能明白，这三个术语可被称为目的、起因和结果；也可被称为存在、形成和显化。所以，一切事物都包含一个三位一体，这三位一体被称为最初，中间和最末，或目的，起因和结果。若明白这一点，也就是能明白一切神性作为都完整和完美地存在于它的最末层。最末层包含一切，因为在先之物同时存在于它里面。</p>

210. 聖言的文字意義是屬靈和屬天意義的基礎,容器和支撐
<p>但凡神性之事物皆有基本,中間,外在三部分組成。基本部分經由中間部分達到外在部分, 由此得以成立並存在。由此可得, 外在部分是基礎。基本部分亦呈現於中間部分, 並藉著中間部分而呈現於外在部分。因此, 外在部分也是個容器。因為外在部分既是個容器還是基礎, 因而也是支撐。
<p>受過教育的讀者能明白, 這三部分可以被稱為目的,手段,結果; 或者稱為存在,形成,體現。目的是存在, 手段是形成, 結果是體現。因此一切完全之物都有這三重部分, 就是基本,中間,外在部分, 又或目的,手段和結果。倘若能明白這點, 也就能領會一切神性工作的外在部分是完全的和圓滿的, 並且外在部分包含著一切, 因為在先的部分都共同和同時呈現於外在部分之中。 </p>

210. 3. The Word's Literal Meaning Is the Foundation, the Container, and the Structural Support for Its Spiritual and Heavenly Meanings.
<p>In all that is divine there is a primary component, a middle component, and an outermost component. The primary component goes forth through the middle component to the outermost component; by doing so it takes on a form and a continued existence. As a result, the outermost component is a foundation. The primary component is also present in the middle component; and by means of the middle component it is present in the outermost component. Therefore the outermost component is also a container. Because the outermost component is both a container and a foundation, it is also a structural support.
<p>The educated reader will understand that these three components could be called the purpose, the means, and the result; and also the being, the becoming, and the taking shape. The purpose is the being, the means is the becoming, and the result is the taking shape. Therefore in everything that is complete, there is a trine called the primary component, the middle component, and the outermost component, or the purpose, the means, and the result. People who understand this also understand that the outermost component of every divine work is complete and perfect; and everything is present in that outermost component because prior components are collectively present in it. </p>

210. III. The literal sense of the Word is the basis, container and support of its spiritual and celestial senses.<p>Everything Divine contains a first, middle and last; the first passes through the middle to the last, and so it comes into and remains in existence; the last is consequently its basis. The first is also present in the middle term, and through this in the last. So the last is a container; and because it is a container and basis, it is also a support. An educated reader will grasp that those three terms can be named end, cause and effect; and also being, becoming and coming-into-being; the end is being, the cause is becoming and the effect is coming-into-being. Consequently everything contains a triad, called first, middle and last, or end, cause and effect. When this is grasped, it will also be grasped that every Divine work is complete and perfect in its last, and that the last contains everything, because the prior terms are simultaneously present in it. </p>

210. III. THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD IS THE BASIS, THE CONTAINANT, AND THE SUPPORT OF ITS SPIRITUAL AND CELESTIAL SENSE. <p>In everything Divine there is a first, a middle, and a last, the first passing through the middle to the last, and so existing and subsisting; consequently the last is the basis. Again, the first is in the middle, and through the middle in the last; thus the last is the Containant. And since the last is the Containant and the Basis, it is also the Support. The learned can understand that these three may be called end, cause, and effect; also being [esse], becoming [fieri] and standing forth [existere]; and that the end is being, the cause is becoming, and the effect is standing forth; consequently that in every complete thing there is a trine, which is called the first, the middle, and the last, also end, cause, and effect. When this is understood, it can also be understood that every Divine work is complete and perfect in its last; also that the whole is in the last, because in it prior things are together. </p>

210. III. THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD IS THE BASIS, THE CONTAINANT, AND THE SUPPORT OF ITS SPIRITUAL AND CELESTIAL SENSES.<p>In everything Divine there is a first, a middle, and a last; the first passes through the middle to the last, and so exists and subsists; consequently the last is the basis. Again, the first is in the middle, and by means of the middle in the last, and thus the last is the containant; and because the last is the containant and the basis, it is also the support. In the phraseology of the learned these three may be called end, cause and effect; also, being, becoming and existing: the end is being, the cause is becoming, and the effect is existing. Consequently, in every thing that is complete there is a trine, called the first, the middle, and the last; also the end, the cause, and the effect. When one understands these things then also does one understand that every Divine work is complete and perfect in its last; and also that the whole is in the last, because the prior things are simultaneously therein. </p>

210. III. Quod Sensus <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
literae Verbi sit Basis, Continens, et Firmamentum Sensus spiritualis et coelestis ejus.<p>In omni Divino est Primum, Medium et Ultimum, ac Primum vadit per Medium ad Ultimum, et sic existit et subsistit; inde Ultimum est BASIS. Tum Primum est in Medio, et per Medium in Ultimo, ita Ultimum est CONTINENS; et quia Ultimum est Continens et Basis, est etiam FIRMAMENTUM. Ab Erudito comprehenditur, quod illa Tria nominari possint Finis, Causa et Effectus; tum Esse, Fieri et Existere, et quod Finis sit Esse, Causa sit Fieri, et Effectus sit Existere; consequenter quod in omni re completa, sit Trinum, quod vocatur Primum, Medium, et Ultimum, tum Finis, Causa et Effectus. Cum haec comprehenduntur, etiam comprehenditur, quod omne Divinum Opus in Ultimo sit Completum et Perfectum; et quoque quod in Ultimo, sit Omne, quia in illo Priora simul.<p>
