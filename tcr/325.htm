<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第九和第十诫  不可贪恋人的房屋；也不可贪恋人的妻子、仆婢、牛驴，并他一切所有的</h4><br />325.在现今一般所用的教理问答中，这段经文被分为两条诫命：一个是第九诫，就是“不可贪恋人的房屋”；另一个是第十诫，就是“不可贪恋人的妻子、仆婢、牛驴，并他一切所有的”。 由于这两条诫命合成了一个整体，并占了一节（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出20.17和申命记.htm">出埃及记20:17和申命记</a><a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.21.htm">5:21</a>），所以我决定把它们放在一起论述。然而，这并非因为我愿意将它们合成一条诫命，我情愿按常规把它们分成两条，毕竟它们全都合在一起才能被称为“十条诫”（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.28和申命记.htm">出埃及记34:28和申命记</a><a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.13.htm">4:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申10.4.htm">10:4</a>）。</p>

325. 第九,十誡 不可貪戀人的房屋; 也不可貪戀人的妻子,僕婢,牛驢, 並他一切所有的。
<p>在教理問答中, 以上內容一般分開為兩條誡命:第九誡, 就是"也不可貪戀人的妻子"; 第十誡, 就是"不可貪戀人的妻子,僕婢,牛驢, 並他一切所有的"。因為這兩條誡命成了一個整體並佔有一節(<a href="3927/exodus_20_17.htm">出埃及記20:17</a>和<a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_21.htm">申命記5:21</a>), 我就集二者於一處。儘管這樣, 並非因我喜歡將它們合成一條誡命, 我倒願意按常規那樣分成兩條誡命, 因為這些誡命在一起被稱為"十言"(和合本譯作"十條誡")(<a href="3927/exodus_34_28.htm">出埃及記34:28</a>和<a href="3927/deuteronomy_4_13.htm">申命記4:13</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_10_4.htm">10:4</a>)。 </p>

325. The Ninth and Tenth Commandments
<p>You Are Not to Covet Your Neighbor's Household;
<p>You Are Not to Covet Your Neighbor's Wife
<p>or His Servant or His Maid or His Ox or His Donkey
<p>or Anything That Is Your Neighbor's
<p>In the catechism that is circulated these days, these have been divided into two commandments. One of them is the ninth commandment: "You are not to covet your neighbor's household. " The other is the tenth: "You are not to covet your neighbor's wife or his servant or his maid or his ox or his donkey or anything that is your neighbor's. " Because these two commandments are united and form just a single verse in <a href="3927/exodus_20_17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a> and in <a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_21.htm">Deuteronomy 5:21</a>, I have taken them up together. It is not my intention, however, to connect them into one commandment. I want to keep them distinguished into two commandments as they have been, since all the commandments are referred to as the ten words (<a href="3927/exodus_34_28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_4_13.htm">Deuteronomy 4:13</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_10_4.htm">10:4</a>). </p>

325. THE NINTH AND TENTH COMMANDMENTS<p>You are not to covet your neighbour's house, you are not to covet your neighbour's wife, nor his man-servant nor his maid-servant, nor his ox nor his ass, nor anything that is your neighbour's.<p>In the Catechism <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
in general use today this passage is divided into two commandments. One, the ninth, is 'You are not to covet your neighbour's house'; the other, the tenth, is 'You are not to covet your neighbour's wife, nor his man-servant nor his maid-servant, nor his ox nor his ass, nor anything that is your neighbour's.' Since these two commandments make a single whole and occupy one verse (<a href="3927/exodus_20_17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a> and <a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_21.htm">Deuteronomy 5:21</a>), I have chosen to treat them together. This, however, is not because I would like to have them coupled to form a single commandment, but I intend them to be divided into two in the usual way, since they are all called together the Ten Words (<a href="3927/exodus_34_28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_4_13.htm">Deuteronomy 4:13</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_10_4.htm">10:4</a>).<p>

325. THE NINTH AND TENTH COMMANDMENTS. <p>THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE; THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE, NOR HIS MANSERVANT NOR HIS MAIDSERVANT, NOR HIS OX, NOR HIS ASS, NOR ANYTHING THAT IS THY NEIGHBOR'S. <p>In the catechisms now in use, this commandment is divided into two, one forming the ninth, which is, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house;" and the other the tenth, which is, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor's." As these two commandments constitute one thing, and in <a href="3927/exodus_20_17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_21.htm">Deuteronomy 5:21</a>, one verse, I have undertaken to treat of the two together; not wishing them to be joined together as one commandment, but rather that as heretofore they be kept separate as two, since the commandments are called (in the Hebrew) the Ten Words (<a href="3927/exodus_34_28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_4_13.htm">Deuteronomy 4:13</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_10_4.htm">10:4</a>). </p>
