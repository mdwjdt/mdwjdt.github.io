827. 对此, 我要补充一个极其重要的事实: 主的母亲马利亚有一次经过, 身穿白衣出现在我头顶上。 然后稍作停留, 她说, 她曾是主的母亲, 祂的确从她受生, 但当衪变成神后, 就脱去了从她所得的人性。 因此, 她现在敬拜祂为自己的神, 不愿有谁将祂看作是她的儿子, 因为祂里面的一切都是神圣的。 </p>

827. Here I will add something very much worth noting. On one occasion Mary, the mother of the Lord happened past. I saw her over my head in white clothing. Then, stopping for a while, she said that she had been the Lord's mother in the sense that he was born from her, but by the time he became God he had put off everything human that came from her. Therefore she now adores him as her God and does not want anyone to see him as her son, because everything in him is divine. </p>

827. To this I shall add this most important fact. Mary, the Lord's mother, once passed by; she was seen overhead, in white clothing. Then she paused to say that she had been the Lord's mother, and He was born to her; but that on becoming God He had put off everything human He derived from her, and she now therefore worships Him as her God, and does not want anyone to acknowledge Him as her son, since everything in Him is Divine. </p>

827. To this I will add this most notable fact: Mary the Mother of the Lord once passed by and appeared overhead in white raiment. Then pausing a little she said that she had been the mother of the Lord, and that He was indeed born of her; but that when He became God, He put off everything of the human He had derived from her, and that therefore she now worships Him as her God, and is unwilling that anyone should acknowledge Him to be her son, since in Him everything is Divine. </p>

827. To the above I will add a matter especially worthy of note. Mary, the mother of the Lord, once passed by; and she appeared over my head in white raiment. Pausing for a moment she said that she was the mother of the Lord, and that He was indeed born of her; but that, having become God, He put off all that was human which He had from her, and that she, therefore, now worships Him as her God; and that she does not desire that any one should acknowledge Him as her son, since all in Him is Divine. </p>

827. His adjiciam hoc dignissimum: Quondam praeteriit MATER DOMINI MARIA, et visa supra Caput in Vestitu albo; et tunc paulum morata dixit, quod Mater Domini fuerit, et quidem ab illa natus, sed quod factus Deus exuerit omne Humanum ex illa, et quod ideo nunc adoret Ipsum ut suum Deum, et quod nolit ut quisquam Ipsum pro suo Filio agnoscat, quoniam in Ipso omne Divinum est. </p>
