470. We Are Not Life, but We Are Vessels for Receiving Life from God
<p>There is a generally held belief that there is life in us, that it belongs to us, and that therefore we are not only vessels for receiving life but we ourselves are life. This common belief derives from the way things appear to be, because we are alive, that is, we sense, think, speak, and act completely as if we had autonomy. Therefore the statement that we are not life, but are vessels for receiving life, cannot help but seem like something completely unheard of before, or like a paradox that goes against our sense-oriented thinking because it goes against the way things appear to be. I have blamed this misleading belief on the way things appear to be - the belief that we are in fact life, and therefore that life has been created as part of us and grafted onto us from birth. But the real reason for this misleading belief (which is based on the way things appear to be) is that many people today are earthly, and few are spiritual. The earthly self makes judgments based on appearances and resulting false impressions, when in fact these run directly counter to the truth, which is that we are not life but are vessels for receiving life.
</p>
<p>
[2] The fact that we are not life but are vessels for receiving life from God is demonstrated by the following clear points of evidence: All things that have been created are intrinsically finite. Human beings, because they are finite, could only have been created from finite things. Therefore in the Book of Creation it says that Adam was made from the ground and its dust [<a href="3927/genesis_2_7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="3927/genesis_3_19.htm">3:19</a>]. In fact, he was named for the ground, since "Adam" means the soil of the earth. And every human being actually consists of nothing other than types of materials that are in the earth or are in the atmosphere from the earth. The elements that are in the atmosphere from the earth we absorb through our lungs and through the pores all over our bodies; we absorb the denser substances through foods made up of earthly elements.
</p>
<p>
[3] As for the human spirit, however, that too has been created from things that are finite. What is the human spirit but a vessel for the life that the mind possesses? The finite things of which it is made are spiritual substances. These substances exist in the spiritual world, but they have also been incorporated into our earth in a hidden way. If these spiritual substances were not present within material substances, seeds would not be loaded with hidden instructions and would not miraculously develop, without deviation, from the first shoot all the way to the production of fruit and new seeds. Worms would not be generated from emanations from the ground and from the gases exuded by plants with which the atmosphere is saturated.
</p>
<p>
[4] It is unreasonable to think that the Infinite could create anything other than what is finite; and that human beings, because they are finite, are anything other than forms that the Infinite is able to bring to life from the life he has within himself. Indeed, this is what is meant by the following: "Jehovah God formed the human being, the dust from the earth, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life" (<a href="3927/genesis_2_7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). Because God is infinite, he is life in itself. This life is not something he can create and then transfer into a human being - that would make the human being God. The serpent or Devil, and from him, Eve and Adam, had the insane thought that this had actually happened. This is why the serpent said, "On the day you eat some of the fruit of this tree, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God" (<a href="3927/genesis_3_5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>).
</p>
<p>
[5] At the end of the earliest church, when it came to its final close, people latched onto the dreadful conviction that God had transfused and transferred himself into human beings. I know so because I have heard it from their own mouths. On account of their horrendous belief that they are gods, they remain profoundly hidden in an underground chamber. No one can get near it without collapsing as a result of inner dizziness. (The fact that Adam and his wife mean and describe the earliest church was made known under the previous heading [<a href="466.htm">466</a>].) </p>

470. II. Man is not life, but a receiver of life from God.<p>It is generally believed that the life which a person has is his own, so that he is not merely a receiver of life but also is life. This general belief exists because he appears to live, that is, to feel, think, speak and act exactly as if of himself. The result is that the statement that man is a receiver of life and is not life must inevitably seem an unheard-of idea or a kind of paradox to those whose thought is based on the senses, because it is contrary to appearances. I have traced to appearances the reason for this wrong belief that man is also life, and that consequently life is implanted in man from creation, and propagated subsequently by transfer. But the reason for this mistake based on appearances is that most people at the present time are natural, and only a few are spiritual; and a natural man bases his judgment on appearances and the mistakes these lead to, and these are diametrically opposed to this truth, that man is merely a receiver of life, and is not life.</p>
<p>
[2] The fact that man is not life, but a receiver of life from God, is proved by the following clear evidence, that all created things are in essence finite, and man, being finite, could only be created of finite substances. That is why the Book of Creation tells us that Adam was made of earth and its dust, and this is the reason for his name, since Adam means the ground. In fact every person is composed exclusively of substances to be found in the earth or emitted from the earth into the atmosphere. The emanations from the earth in the atmosphere are absorbed by people by means of the lungs and by pores throughout the body; the denser substances are absorbed in the form of food made from the earth's products.</p>
<p>
[3] As for man's spirit, however, this too was created from finite substances. What is man's spirit but a receiver of mental life? The finite materials of which it is composed are spiritual substances, to be found in the spiritual world, and also transferred to our earth and there stored up. If they were not present there along with material substances, no seed could at the inmost level have been made fertile, and so grow in a wonderful way without any aberration from its first structure until it produces fruits and new seeds. Nor would any worms be procreated by effluvia from the earth and from gases given off by plants and impregnating the atmosphere.</p>
<p>
[4] Can anyone reasonably suppose that the Infinite could create anything other than that which is finite, or that man, being finite, is anything but a form, which the Infinite can bring to life by the life in itself? This is what is meant by the following:<p>Jehovah God formed man, dust from the earth, and He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, <a href="3927/genesis_2_7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>.<p>God, being infinite, is life in Himself. This cannot be created and copied into man, for this would be making him God. The idea that this happened was the madness of the serpent, or the devil, which he passed on to Eve and Adam, for the serpent said:<p>On the day when you eat of the fruit of that tree, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, <a href="3927/genesis_3_5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>.</p>
<p>
[5] This deadly conviction, that God infused and copied Himself into men, was held by the people of the most ancient church in its final period leading up to its termination, as I have heard from their own lips. On account of their horrendous belief that they were thus gods, they lie hidden deep within a cavern, which no one can approach closely without falling victim to an inner vertigo. The previous section made it known that Adam and his wife mean and describe the most ancient church. </p>

<p>
470. III. MAN IS NOT LIFE, BUT A RECEPTACLE OF LIFE FROM GOD. <p>It is generally believed that life is in man as his own, thus that he is not only a receptacle of life, but is also life. This general belief is from its so appearing, since man lives; that is, feels, thinks, speaks, and acts, wholly as if from himself. Wherefore the statement that man is a receptacle of life, and not life, must needs seem like something unheard of, or like a paradox, because it is opposed to the appearance, and thus to sensual thought. The cause of the fallacious belief that man is also life itself, consequently that life was created in man and afterward generated by parents, I have adduced from the appearance; but the reason why the fallacy is drawn from the appearance, is that most men at the present day are natural, and but few are spiritual, and the natural man judges from appearances and their fallacies, which are diametrically opposed to the truth that man is not life but only a receptacle of life.
</p>
<p>
[2] That man is not life but a receptacle of life from God can be seen from these evident proofs, that all created things are in themselves finite, and that man, being finite, could have been created only from things finite. Therefore it is said in the book of Creation, that Adam was made from the earth and its dust, from which he was also named, for "Adam" means the earth's soil; and it is a fact that every man consists only of such things as are in the earth, and from the earth in the atmospheres. Those things that are in the atmospheres from the earth man absorbs by means of his lungs and the pores of his whole body, and the grosser elements he absorbs by means of food composed of earthy substances.
</p>
<p>
[3] But in regard to man's spirit, that also is created from finite things. What is man's spirit but a receptacle of the life of the mind? The finite things of which it is composed are spiritual substances, which are in the spiritual world, and are also brought together in our earth and hidden therein. Unless they were therein along with material things no seed could be impregnated from things inmost, and then grow in a wonderful manner undeviatingly from the first shoot even to fruit and to new seed. Neither could any worms be procreated from effluvia from the earth and exhalations from vegetable matters, with which the atmospheres are impregnated.
</p>
<p>
[4] Who can think rationally that the infinite can create anything but finite things, and that man, being finite, is anything but a form which the infinite can vivify from the life in itself? And this is what is meant by these words: <p>Jehovah God formed man, the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of lives (<a href="3927/genesis_2_7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). <p>God, because He is infinite, is Life in Himself. This He cannot create and then transfer into man, for that would be to make man God. That this was done was the insane idea of the serpent or the devil, and from him of Adam and Eve; for the serpent said: <p>In the day ye eat of the fruit of this tree your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God (<a href="3927/genesis_3_5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>).
</p>
<p>
[5] This dire persuasion, that God transfused and transferred Himself into men, was held by the men of the Most Ancient church at its end, when it was consummated. This I have heard from their own mouths; and on account of that horrible belief that they were consequently gods, they lie deeply hidden in a cavern near to which no one can approach without being seized by an inward dizziness which causes him to fall. That the Most Ancient church is meant and described by Adam and his wife, has been made known in the preceding section. </p>

470. II. MAN IS NOT LIFE, BUT A FORM FOR THE RECEPTION OF LIFE <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
FROM GOD.<p>It is generally believed that life is in a man and is his own, and consequently that he is not only a form receptive of life, but actually is life. This general belief arises from the appearance, for he lives, that is, he feels, thinks, speaks and acts altogether as of himself. This proposition, then, that man is a form receptive of life, and not life itself, cannot but seem to be like something hitherto unheard of, or like a paradox, opposed to sensual thought, because contrary to the appearance. The cause of this fallacious belief that man actually is life, and consequently that life is inherent in him from creation and is afterwards propagated by descent, I have indicated as due to appearance. The cause, however, of this fallacy derived from appearance is that most men at this day are natural, and few are spiritual. The natural man judges from appearances, and the fallacies thence derived are diametrically opposed to this truth, that man is merely a form receptive of life and not life itself.</p>
<p>
[2] That man is not life, but a form receptive of life from God, is evident from these plain proofs, that all created things are in themselves finite, and that man, because he is finite, could not have been created except from finite things. It is, therefore, said in the Book of Genesis, that Adam was made from the earth and its dust, from which also he was named, for Adam signifies the soil of the earth; and every man physically consists only of such things as are in the earth and from the earth in the atmospheres. What is in the atmospheres from the earth he absorbs through his lungs and the pores of his whole body, and the grosser things through his food, which is composed of earthly materials.</p>
<p>
[3] The spirit of man is also created from finite things; for what is his spirit but a receptacle of the life of the mind? The finite things of which it is composed are spiritual substances which are in the spiritual world. These are also brought into our world where they remain stored up as latent factors. If these were not present together with the material elements it would be impossible for any seed to be interiorly impregnated and then to grow up in a wonderful manner without deviation from the initial shoot to the fruit and new seed; nor would any creeping thing breed from the effluvia of the earth and vegetable exhalations with which the atmospheres are impregnated.</p>
<p>
[4] Who can rationally suppose that the Infinite can create anything but what is finite? and that man, because he is finite, is anything but a form which the Infinite is able to vivify from the life which is in itself? This is what is meant by these words:<p>"JEHOVAH God formed man, dust of the earth, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of lives (A.V., life)" <a href="3927/genesis_2_7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>.<p>God, because He is infinite, is Life in Himself. This life He cannot create and so transfer to man, for that would be to make him God.</p>
<p>
[5] That this actually happened was an insane idea of the serpent or devil, and by him was instilled into Eve and Adam; for the serpent said:<p>"In the day ye eat" of the fruit of this tree, "Your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God (A.V., gods)" <a href="3927/genesis_3_5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>.<p>This dreadful persuasion that God transfused and transferred Himself into men was entertained, as I have heard from their own lips, by the men of the Most Ancient Church at its end, when it reached its consummation. So they, on account of this horrible belief that thus they were gods, lie hidden deep down in a cavern which no one can approach without being struck down in a faint. It was made known in the preceding article that by Adam and his wife is understood and described the Most Ancient Church.<p>

470. Quod homo non sit Vita, sed Receptaculum vitae a Deo.<p>Communiter creditur, quod Vita sit in homine, ejus, ita quod non modo sit receptaculum vitae, sed etiam Vita; quod ita communiter credatur, est ex apparentia, quia vivit, hoc est, sentit, cogitat, loquitur et agit prorsus ut ex se, quare hoc, quod homo sit Receptaculum vitae, et non Vita, non potest non videri, quam ut quoddam nondum auditum, aut sicut paradoxon, sensuali cogitationi, quia apparentiae, adversum. Causam fallacis hujus fidei, quod homo etiam sit vita, consequenter quod vita homini sit increata, et postea per traducem ingenerata, deduxi ex apparentia, sed causa fallaciae ex apparentia est, quod plerique hodie sint naturales, et pauci spirituales, et naturalis homo judicat ex apparentiis et inde fallaciis, et hae e diametro contra hanc veritatem sunt quod homo sit modo receptaculum vitae et non vita.</p>
<p>
[2] Quod homo non sit vita, sed receptaculum vitae a Deo, constat ex evidentibus his testimoniis, quod omnia, quae creata sunt, in se finita sint, et quod homo, quia finitus, non potuerit creari nisi ex finitis; quare in Libro Creationis dicitur, quod Adam ex terra et ejus pulvere factus sit, ex quo etiam nominatus est, Adam enim significat terrae humum; et omnis homo non actualiter consistit, nisi ex talibus quae in terra sunt, et ex terra in athmosphaeris; illa quae in Athmosphaeris ex terra sunt, homo insorbet per pulmones, et per poros totius corporis, et crassiora per cibos e terrenis confectos.</p>
<p>
[3] Quod autem Spiritum hominis concernit, etiam ille a finitis creatus est; quid spiritus hominis nisi receptaculum vitae mentis; finita ex quibus ille, sunt spirituales substantiae, quae in Mundo spirituali sunt, et in terram nostram etiam collatae, et inibi reconditae; quae nisi simul cum materialibus inessent, non aliquod semen potuisset impraegnari ab intimis, et inde mirabiliter excrescere absque ulla deviatione a primo stamine usque ad fructus, et ad nova semina; nec aliqui vermes procrearentur ex effluviis e terra, et ex exspiratione halituum e vegetabilibus, e quibus athmosphaerae impraegnatae sunt.</p>
<p>
[4] Quis potest ex ratione cogitare, quod Infinitum possit aliud quam finitum creare, et quod homo, quia est finitus, sit <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
aliud quam forma, quam Infinitum vivificare potest ex vita in se; et hoc intelligitur per haec, Formavit Jehovah Deus hominem, pulverem de terra, et inspiravit in nares ejus animam vitarum, <a href="3927/genesis_2_7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>. Deus, quia Infinitus est, est Vita in Seipso; hanc non potest creare et sic transcribere in hominem, nam hoc foret facere illum Deum; quod hoc factum sit, fuit insania serpentis seu diaboli, et ab illo Chaivae et Adami, nam dixit Serpens, Quo die comederitis de fructu hujus Arboris, aperientur oculi vestri, et eritis sicut Deus, <a href="3927/genesis_3_5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>.</p>
<p>
[5] Quod dira haec persuasio, quod Deus se transfuderit et transcripserit in homines, fuerit hominibus Antiquissimae Ecclesiae in fine ejus quando consummata est, ex ore illorum audivi, et hi propter horrendam illam fidem, quod sic dii essent, jacent profunde occultati in Caverna, ad quam nemo potest prope accedere, nisi interiore vertigine actus succumbat. Quod per Adamum et ejus uxorem intelligatur et describatur Antiquissima Ecclesia, in praecedente Articulo notum factum est.<p>
