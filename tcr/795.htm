795. 鉴于此, 也因为我逐日和灵界的各国各族交谈, 既有欧洲人, 也有亚洲人, 非洲人, 还有不同宗教信仰的人。 我简要描述一下其中一些人民的情况, 作为本书的一个补充。 必须牢记, 在灵界, 总体的各国和各族, 以及个体的每个人, 其状况和他们对神的承认和敬拜一致; 凡发自内心承认神者, 和今后承认主耶稣基督为神, 救世主, 救主者, 都在天堂, 而那些不承认祂的人, 则在天堂之下, 在此接受教导, 凡接受教导者被提升天堂, 而不接受者则被丢进地狱; 归到诸如只靠近父神的苏西尼派, 或否认主人性的神性的阿里乌派之流。 因为主说:<p>我就是道路, 真理和生命; 若不藉着我, 没有人能到父那里去。 <p>主对想要看到父的腓力说:<p>人看见了我, 就是看见和认识了父 (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">约翰福音14:6</a>)。 </p>

795. Since this is how it is there, I have conversations every day with the races and peoples of this world. I have interaction not only with people in Europe but also people in Asia and Africa. I talk to people of a variety of religions. Therefore by way of an epilogue to this work I will add a brief description of the state of some of them.
<p>Keep in mind that in the spiritual world, the state of every race and people in general and of each individual in particular depends on their acknowledgment and worship of God. All those who acknowledge God at heart, and from now on, who acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ as God the Redeemer and Savior, are in heaven. People who do not acknowledge him are beneath heaven and are given instruction there. Those who accept the instruction are lifted up into heaven. Those who do not accept it are cast down into hell. In this second group are people like the Socinians, who turn to God the Father alone, and people like the Arians, who have denied that the Lord's human manifestation was divine. The Lord himself said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>); and when Philip asked to see the Father, the Lord said to him, "Those who see and recognize me, see and recognize the Father" (<a href="3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7</a> and following). </p>

795. This being so, and since I have day by day talked with nations and peoples of this world, not only those from Europe, but also those from Asia and Africa, as well as those of other religions, I shall add as a supplement to this book a short description of the condition of some of them. It needs to be grasped that the condition in the spiritual world both of each nation and people in general and of each individual in particular depends on their acknowledgment of God and their worship of Him. All who at heart acknowledge God, and from this time on who acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ as God the Redeemer and Saviour, are in heaven. Those who do not acknowledge Him are below heaven, and are there taught; those who accept the teaching are raised to heaven. Those who reject it are cast down into hell; these include also those who, like the Socinians, have approached only God the Father, and those who, like the Arians, have denied the divinity of the Lord's Human. For the Lord said:<p>I am the way, truth and life; no one comes to the Father except through me.<p>And He said to Philip, who wanted to see the Father:<p>He who sees and knows me sees and knows the Father, <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>ff. </p>

795. This being the case, and also because I have talked there daily with the nations and peoples of this world, both with those who are in Europe, and also, with those who are in Asia and Africa, thus with those of different religions, I will add as a supplement to this work a brief description of the state of some of these peoples. It must be borne in mind that in the spiritual world the state of every nation and people in general, and also of individuals, is in accordance with their acknowledgment and worship of God; and that all who in heart acknowledge God, and from this time on, all who acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ as God, Redeemer, and Savior, are in heaven, while those who do not acknowledge Him are beneath heaven; where they are taught, and those who accept what they are taught, are raised up into heaven, but those who do not are cast down to hell; and to this class belong those who, like the Socinians, have approached God the Father only, or who like the Arians have denied the Divinity of the Lord's Human. For the Lord said: <p>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father but through Me. (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>). <p>And to Philip who wished to see the Father; He said: <p>He that hath seen and known Me, hath seen and known the Father (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>). </p>

795. Since the spiritual world is such as I have described, and since I have daily conversed there with men from different nations and peoples in this world, not only with people from Europe but also with some from Asia and Africa, and thus with people of various religions, I will add by way of a conclusion to this work a brief description of the state of some of them. The following facts, however, should be borne in mind. In the spiritual world the state of every nation and people as communities, as well as of all their members individually, is according to their acknowledgment of God and their worship of Him. All who in heart acknowledge God, and henceforth all who acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ as God, the Redeemer and Savior, are in heaven. Those who do not acknowledge Him are beneath heaven, and there they undergo instruction; those who accept Him are raised up into heaven, and those who refuse are cast down into hell. Among the latter are those who, like the Socinians, <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
have approached God the Father only, or who, like the Arians, <sup "fn9_2">2</sup>
have denied the Divinity of the Lord's Human. For the Lord said:<p>"I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by me;"<p>and to Philip who wished to see the Father He said that:<p>He that seeth and knoweth me, seeth and knoweth the Father, <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a> and following verses.<p>

<div class="footnote-section">
<p>
<a href="#fn9_1">1</a>.&nbsp;Socinians, members of a religious sect taking their name from Faustus Socinus, A.D. 1539-1604, and his uncle Laelius Socinus. They are antitrinitarians, denying the personality of the Holy Ghost and the Divinity of Christ. Early Socians believed in the miraculous conception and that Christ was entitled to Divine worship; but modern Socinians, chiefly Unitarians, deny both.<br><br><a href="#fn9_2">2</a>.&nbsp;Arius, theologian of Alexandria, A.D 256-336; founder of Arianism, affirming that Christ was an originated Being. Excommunicated by bishops of Egypt for denying that Christ was made of the same substance (homo-ousion) of any previously existing substance. To settle the consequent dispute Constantine called the Council of Nicaea, A.D. 325. Athanasius successfully led the opposition to Arius; and Arius, with Eusebius, who also refused to accept the Athanasian position, was banished. </p>

795. Quoniam ita est, et indies ibi loquutus sum cum Gentibus et Populis hujus Mundi, ita non solum cum illis qui in Europa sunt, sed etiam cum illis qui in Asia et in Africa, ita cum illis, qui ex varia Religione sunt, Coronidis loco ad hoc Opus adjiciam brevem descriptionem de Statu quorundam ex illis. Tenendum est, quod cujusvis tam Gentis et Populi in communi, quam singulorum in particulari, Status in Mundo spirituali sit secundum agnitionem Dei et cultum Ipsius, et quod omnes qui corde agnoscunt Deum, et post hoc tempus qui agnoscunt Dominum Jesum Christum Deum Redemptorem et Salvatorem, in Coelo sint, et quod qui Ipsum non agnoscunt, sub Coelo sint, et ibi instruantur, et quod qui recipiunt, in Coelum eleventur, et quod qui non recipiunt, in Infernum dejiciantur; inter hos etiam illi veniunt, qui sicut Sociniani solum Deum Patrem adiverunt, et qui sicut Ariani Divinitatem Humani Domini negaverunt; nam dixit Dominus, EGO SUM VIA, VERITAS ET VITA; NEMO VENIT AD PATREM NISI PER ME; et ad Philippum, qui voluit videre Patrem, QUOD QUI ME VIDET ET COGNOSCIT, VIDEAT ET COGNOSCAT PATREM, <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">Johannes 14:6</a>. seq. </p>
