828. 灵界的伊斯兰教徒。 <p>在灵界, 伊斯兰教徒位于西方, 在天主教徒的后面, 好象围绕他们形成了一个边界。 基督徒之后紧接着就是他们, 因为他们承认我们的主是最伟大的先知, 最有智慧的人, 被派到世上教导人类, 而且祂是神的儿子。 在灵界, 每个人的居住地与基督徒所在中心区的距离, 取决于他们对主和一个神的信仰。 因为将心智与天堂联结起来的, 就是信仰, 它决定了与东方的距离, 东部地区上方就是主。 </p>

828. Muslims in the Spiritual World
<p>The Muslims in the spiritual world appear behind the Roman Catholics in the west; they form a kind of circle around them. The reason why they appear close behind the Christians is that they acknowledge our Lord as the greatest prophet and the wisest of people, who was sent into the world to teach people; some even acknowledge him as the Son of God.
<p>In that world, the distance between where people live and the center, where Christians are, depends on the extent to which they believe in the Lord and in one God. This belief unites people's minds to heaven and determines their proximity to the eastern region, the region closest to the Lord. </p>

828. The Mohammedans in the spiritual world.<p>The Mohammedans in the spiritual world are to be seen behind the Roman Catholics in the West, and so to speak surrounding them. The reason why they are to be seen close behind the Christians is that they recognise our Lord as a very great prophet, the wisest of all, who was sent into the world to teach mankind, and they also recognise Him as the Son of God. In the spiritual world the distance of everyone's dwelling from the centre, where the Christians are, depends upon his belief in the Lord and in one God. For that is what links their minds with heaven, and distances them from the east, over which the Lord is. </p>

<p>
828. THE MOHAMMEDANS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD. <p>The Mohammedans in the spiritual world appear behind the Papists in the west, and form as it were a border around them. They appear next behind the Christians because they acknowledge our Lord to be the greatest prophet, the wisest of all men, who was sent into the world to teach men, and also that He is the Son of God. In that world everyone dwells at such a distance from the central region, where the Christians are, as accords with their confession of the Lord and of one God; for that confession is what conjoins minds with heaven, and determines distance from the east, above which quarter is the Lord. </p>

828. VIII. MOHAMMEDANS <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD.<p>Mohammedans in the spiritual world appear behind the Roman Catholics in the west, occupying a region bordering upon them in that direction. They are next beyond the Christians, because they acknowledge our Lord as the greatest of all Prophets, the wisest of all, who was sent into the world to teach men, and also as the Son of God. All in the spiritual world dwell at a distance from the centre, where the Christians are, according to their confession of the Lord and of one God; for that confession unites their minds with heaven, and determines their distance from the east, above which is the Lord.<p>

<a href="#fn9_1">1</a>.&nbsp;Mohammad, the founder of Mohammedanism or Islam, A.D. 571-632, was born at Mecca, where his father was spiritual and temporal head. He married a wealthy and devout widow, and owed much to her influence. In the visions to which he was subject he received confirmations of his Divine mission. He also received messages from Gabriel which were incorporated in the KORAN, the sacred book of Mohammedanism. Early persecution drove him from Mecca and in the year A.D. 622 he fled to Medina, where he was cordially welcomed. This flight, or Hejira, marks the beginning of the Mohammedan year, and from Medina he set out on his conquest of Arabia. Mohammedanism proclaims the unity of the God-head, and condemns idolatry; but the peaceful methods of propaganda soon gave place to ruthless persecution of infidels and merciless extermination of idolators. </p>

828. DE MAHUMEDANIS IN MUNDO SPIRITUALI.<p>Mahumedani in Mundo spirituali apparent post Pontificios in Occidente, et faciunt sicut ambitum: quod appareant proxime post Christianos, est quia Dominum nostrum agnoscunt, pro Maximo Propheta, Sapientissimo omnium, qui missus est in Mundum ut doceret homines, et quoque pro Filio Dei. Quisque in illo Mundo habitat ad distantiam a Meditullio, ubi sunt Christiani, secundum Confessionem Domini et Unius Dei; nam illa conjungit animos Coelo, et facit distantiam ob Oriente, super quo est Dominus. </p>
