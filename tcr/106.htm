<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第106节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>106</b>.这两种状态可由宇宙万物来代表，因为它们符合神序，而神序充满宇宙万物，直至最小细节。在每个人的生命中，第一种状态由他的婴儿、孩童，直到少年、青年和成年早期时的状态来代表。这种状态以他在父母面前的谦卑，顺服，以及教师和导师的教导为标志；而第二种状态则由这个人成长为自己的主人和自主选择者，或自由行使自己的意愿和觉知，并且在自己家里有控制权时的状态来代表。所以，下列状态可代表第一种状态：他成为王或君主前的王子、国王的儿子或君主的儿子的状态；市民成为地方法官前的状态；国民成为公务人员前的状态；学生成为神父前接受神职训练时的状态，然后成为牧师前的状态，再后来成为主教前的状态；少女成为妻子前的状态，或侍女成为当家主母前的状态；一般来说，职员成为店主前的状态，或士兵成为军官前的状态，仆人成为主人前的状态。这些人的第一种状态是服侍的状态，第二种状态是行使自己的意愿并由此行使自己的觉知的状态。<br />这两种状态也可由动物界的各种生物来代表。第一种状态由走兽和飞鸟尚由父母照料，时时跟随它们，由它们喂养和引导时的状态来代表；而第二种状态则由它们离开父母、自己照顾自己时的状态来代表。毛虫同样具有这样的代表性：第一种状态由它们爬行并吞食树叶时的状态来代表，第二种状态则由它们蜕皮变成蝴蝶时的状态来代表。这两种状态还可用植物界中的事物来代表：第一种状态由植株从种子萌芽，然后长出大小枝叶时的状态来代表，第二种状态则由它结果并产出新种子时的状态来代表。这好比真理与良善的结合，因为属树木的一切皆与真理相对应，而果实则与各种良善相对应。停留在第一种状态，未进入第二种状态的人就象只长叶、不结果的树。论到这种树，圣言上说：<br />它要被连根拔起，丢在火里。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.19.htm">马太福音7:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.19.htm">21:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路3.9.htm">路加福音3:9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.6.htm">13:6</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.9.htm">9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.5.htm">约翰福音15:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.6.htm">6</a>）<br />他还好比不愿自由的奴隶，被命令他要被带到门前，靠近门框，用锥子穿耳（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.6.htm">出埃及记21:6</a>）。那些不与主结合之人就是奴隶，而那些与主结合之人是自由的。因为主说：<br />儿子若叫你们自由，你们就真自由了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.36.htm">约翰福音8:36</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #106 </h4>
<p>
106. 因為這兩種狀態符合聖規, 而聖規適用於宇宙所有大大小小, 甚至細微的事物, 因此宇宙中一些不同的事物可以用表達這兩種狀態。
<p>第一個狀態可以表示為每個人從嬰兒到孩童, 再到少年, 直至青年。這種狀態的特點是, 在父母面前謙虛受教,順服, 並受老師們的教導。而第二個狀態則是此人之後可自行做主,自行抉擇時, 或者按他自己的認知和意志去行。當此階段, 他在自己家中當家作主。
<p>第一個狀態可用王子或公爵之子, 在他們成為國王或公爵之前的狀態。也類似任何公民成為地方官之前的狀態; 或國民成為官員之前的狀態; 或任何正受訓去侍奉的學生在成為牧職之前的狀態,以及後來在成為牧師之前的執事狀態; 成為主教前的牧師狀態。又類似少女成為人妻前的狀態, 或女僕成為主婦或女主人之前的狀態。總而言之, 它是一個學徒成為店主之前的狀態, 士兵成為長官前的狀態, 僕人成為一家之主前的狀態。處於第一個狀態的人們處於凡事臣服,聽命的狀態。而第二個狀態則是順隨自己的意志以及按自己的認知去行。
<p>動物世界中的現象也可用來表達這些。第一種狀態可表示那些仍舊跟隨父母的鳥與獸, 靠父母餵養和照顧。第二個狀態指它們離開父母, 自食其力, 自己照顧自己。
<p>毛蟲也是類似, 第一個狀態是當它們在樹葉上爬行,吃樹葉充饑之時。第二個狀態是它們擺脫先前的樣子,變成蝴蝶。
<p>這兩個狀態也可用植物界的事物來表示。第一個狀態是指某植物從種子開始, 直到長出枝條和葉子。第二個狀態是當它們長出果子, 結出新的種子。這可以用來比作真理與良善的結合, 樹的不同部分對應於各樣的真理, 而不同的果子則對應於各樣的良善。
<p>如果人只是停留在第一個狀態, 而不進入第二個狀態, 那就像樹只長葉子, 不結果子。就是聖言中所說, 這樣的樹要被拔掉並扔進火裡燒(<a href="3927/matthew_7_19.htm">馬太福音7:19</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_21_19.htm">21:19</a>;<a href="3927/luke_3_9.htm">路加福音3:9</a>; <a href="3927/luke_13_6.htm">13:6-9</a>;<a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">約翰福音15:5-6</a>)。這也像那些不想要自由的奴僕, 對於他們, 則被命令帶到門前, 靠著門框, 有錐子穿耳(<a href="3927/exodus_21_6.htm">出埃及記21:6</a>)。"奴僕"指與主沒有聯合之人, "自由"則指與主聯合之人。因此主說:"子若讓你自由, 你就真自由了"(<a href="3927/john_8_36.htm">約翰福音8:36</a>) </p>

106. Because these two states follow the divine design, and the divine design fills everything large and small down to the least detail in the universe, therefore there are a number of different things in the universe that represent these two states.
<p>The first state is represented by the stages we all go through from infancy to childhood and into our teenage years, our twenties, and our thirties. These stages entail our being deferential and obedient to our parents, and learning from teachers and ministers.
<p>The second state, however, is represented by our stages later on when we are responsible for ourselves and our own choices, when we have our own will and our own understanding, and have authority in our own home.
<p>The first state, then, is represented by the situation of a prince, the son of a king, or else a son of a duke, before he becomes the king or the duke himself; or by the situation of any citizens before they become civic leaders; or of any royal subjects before they take government positions; or of any students studying for the ministry before they become priests. The same applies to the situation of those priests before they become rectors, and of those rectors before they become deans. The same also applies to the situation of any young women before they marry; or to the situation of any female servants before they become heads of households. This is generally the situation of apprentices before they go into business for themselves, of soldiers before they become ranking officers, and of male servants before they become heads of households. The first state in every case is a kind of slavery while the second state belongs to our own will and intellect.
<p>These two states are also represented by various things in the animal kingdom. The first state is represented by animals and birds as long as they are still with their mothers and fathers, when they follow them around constantly and are fed and raised by them. The second state is represented when they leave their parents and take care of themselves.
<p>Caterpillars are another example. They represent the first state when they inch along and eat leaves; the second, when they shed their old form and become butterflies.
<p>These two states are also represented by members of the plant kingdom. The first state is represented when a plant grows from a seed and is decked out with branches, boughs, and leaves; the second is represented when the plant produces fruit and generates new seeds. This sequence is equivalent to the way truth and goodness join together, in that all parts of a tree correspond to kinds of truth, and pieces of fruit correspond to good things [that result].
<p>If we stay in the first state and do not go on to the second we are like a tree that produces only leaves but no fruit. It says in the Word that this type of tree has to be uprooted and thrown into the fire (<a href="3927/matthew_7_19.htm">Matthew 7:19</a>; <a href="3927/luke_3_9.htm">Luke 3:9</a>; ; <a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5-6</a>). This is also like a slave who does not want to be free. There used to be a law that slaves like this had to be taken to a door or a post and have their ears pierced with an awl (<a href="3927/exodus_21_6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>). "Slaves" are people who have no partnership with the Lord. "The free" are people who have such a partnership; for the Lord says, If the Son makes you free, you are truly free (<a href="3927/john_8_36.htm">John 8:36</a>). </p>

106. These two states are represented by various things in the natural universe. The reason is that they are in accordance with Divine order, and this pervades every single thing in the universe, down to the smallest detail. The first state is represented in the life of every person by his infancy and childhood, until he becomes a youth, adolescent and young man. This state is marked by humility before his parents, obedience, and being instructed by masters and underlings. The second state is represented by the same person's state when he becomes his own master, can make his own decisions, or follow his own will and his own understanding; at this stage he has control in his own house.<p>The first state then is represented by the state of a prince, a king's or duke's son, before he becomes king or duke. Likewise by the state of any citizen, before he becomes a magistrate; or of any subject before he becomes an official; or of any student who is being trained for the ministry before he becomes a priest, and then his state before he becomes a pastor, and then before he becomes a bishop; or of any young woman before she becomes a wife, or of any serving girl before she becomes mistress of a household. Generally speaking, it is the state of any apprentice before he becomes a merchant, any soldier before he becomes an officer, any servant before he becomes head of a household. The first state of these people is that of being a servant, the second that of following one's own will, and so one's own understanding.</p>
<p>
[2] There are also various representations of these two states in the animal kingdom. The first is represented by animals and birds so long as they are tended by their parents, follow them constantly, and are fed and guided by them; the second when they leave their parents and look after themselves. Likewise with caterpillars, the first state is when they crawl and feed on leaves, the second when they slough their cases and become butterflies. There are also representations of these two states in things of the vegetable kingdom: the first when a plant springs up from seed, and decks itself out with branches, boughs and leaves; the second when it bears fruit, and produces a fresh crop of seed. This can be compared to the link between truth and good, because everything about a tree corresponds to truths, its fruits to kinds of good. A person who stops at the first state without entering upon the second is like a tree which produces only leaves and no fruit; of such a tree it is said in the Word that it is to be rooted out and cast into the fire ([<a href="3927/matthew_17_19.htm">Matthew 17:19</a>], <a href="3927/matthew_21_19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>; <a href="3927/luke_3_9.htm">Luke 3:9</a>; <a href="3927/luke_13_6.htm">13:6-9</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5-6</a>). Or he is like the slave who does not wish to be free, of whom it was commanded that he should be brought to the door or door-post, and have his ear pierced with an awl (<a href="3927/exodus_21_6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>). Those who have no link with the Lord are slaves, but those who have are free; for the Lord says:<p>If the Son makes you free, you are truly free, <a href="3927/john_8_36.htm">John 8:36</a>. </p>

106. These two states are represented by various things in the universe, and for the reason that they are in accordance with Divine order, and the Divine order fills all things and each thing in the universe, even to the utmost particular. In every man the first state is represented by his state of infancy and childhood until the time of puberty, youth, and early manhood, and this is a state of humiliation before his parents, of obedience, and also of instruction by masters and tutors; while the second state is represented in the state of the same person when he becomes his own master and chooser, or freely exercises his own will and understanding, and has control in his own home. So the first state is represented by that of a prince or king's son or duke's son, before he has become a king or a duke; likewise by the state of any citizen before he has assumed the office of magistrate; of any subject before he enters upon the functions of any office; of any student who is being prepared for the ministry, before he becomes a priest; and of the priest before he becomes a pastor; and of the pastor before he becomes a primate; also of any virgin before she becomes a wife, and of any maidservant before she becomes a mistress; and in general, of any clerk before he becomes a merchant, of any soldier before he becomes an officer, and of any servant before he becomes a master. The first is a state of servitude, the second is the exercise of one's own will and from this of one's own understanding. Again, these two states are represented by various things in the animal kingdom-the first by beasts and birds while they continue with their parents, following them constantly, and being nourished and guided by them; and the second when they leave the old ones and take care of themselves; likewise by worms-the first state while they crawl and feed upon leaves, and the second when they cast off their coverings and become butterflies. Still again, these two states are represented by the subjects of the vegetable kingdom-the first while the plant is springing up from the seed and is adorned with boughs, twigs, and leaves, the second when it bears fruit and produces new seed. This, too, may be likened to the conjunction of truth and good, since all things belonging to a tree correspond to truths, while the fruits correspond to the various kinds of good. But the man who remains in the first state and does not enter the second, is like a tree that produces leaves only and not fruit, of which it is said in the Word: <p>That it must be rooted up and cast into the fire (<a href="3927/matthew_7_19.htm">Matthew 7:19</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_21_19.htm">21:19</a>; <a href="3927/luke_3_9.htm">Luke 3:9</a>; <a href="3927/luke_13_6.htm">13:6-9</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5, 6</a>); <p>and he is like a servant that did not wish to be free, concerning whom it was commanded: <p>That he should be brought to the door or to the doorpost, and his ear be pierced with an awl (<a href="3927/exodus_21_6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>). <p>Servants are those who are not conjoined to the Lord; while the free are those who are conjoined to Him; for the Lord says: <p>If the Son maketh you free, ye shall be free indeed (<a href="3927/john_8_36.htm">John 8:36</a>). </p>

106. These two states are represented by various phases of life in the universe because they are according to Divine order, and the Divine order pervades all things, even to the most minute, in the universe. The first state is represented in the life of every man from his infancy and childhood to the time of his youth and early manhood. This is a state of humiliation before his parents, of obedience, and also of instruction under masters and ministers. The second state, however, is represented by that of the same person when he becomes master of himself and his own freedom of judgment, or master of his own will and understanding, in which state he is master in his own house. The first state is likewise represented by that of a prince or son of a king, or son of a duke, before he becomes king or duke; also by the state of every citizen before he becomes a magistrate; of every subject before he discharges the function of any office; also of every student who is preparing for the ministry before he becomes a priest, and afterwards before he becomes a pastor, and then before he becomes a Primate; of every virgin before she becomes a wife; and of every maidservant before she becomes a mistress; in general of every clerk before he becomes a merchant, of every soldier before he becomes an officer, and of every servant before he becomes a master. Their first state is one of servitude and the second one in which they exercise their own will and their own understanding.<p>These two states are also represented by various stages in the animal kingdom: the first by beasts and birds so long as they remain with their parents, whom they follow continually and by whom they are nourished and guided; and the second when they leave their parents and provide for themselves. In the case of caterpillars, the first state is when they creep and feed on leaves, and the second when they cast their skins and become butterflies. These two states are also represented in the subjects of the vegetable kingdom: the first when the plant springs from the seed, and puts forth branches, shoots and leaves; and the second when it bears fruit and produces new seeds. This process may be compared to the union of good and truth, since the several parts of a tree correspond to truths, and the fruit to good. The man who continues in the first state, and does not enter upon the second, is like a tree that bears leaves only, and not fruit, concerning which it is said in the Word:<p>"that it must be rooted up and cast into the fire," <a href="3927/matthew_21_19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>; <a href="3927/luke_3_9.htm">Luke 3:9</a>; <a href="3927/luke_13_6.htm">13:6-9</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>, <a href="3927/john_15_8.htm">8</a>.<p>He is also like a servant who does not wish to be free, concerning whom it was decreed:<p>that he should be brought to the door, or to the door-post, and his ear bored through with an awl. <a href="3927/exodus_21_6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>.<p>Servants are those who are not united to the Lord, but the free are those who are united to Him, for the Lord says:<p>"If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed" <a href="3927/john_8_36.htm">John 8:36</a>. </p>
