<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>167</b>.人皆承认，这三要素，即灵魂、身体和活动在主神救主里面，无论过去还是现在。祂的灵魂来自耶和华父，这一点无人否认，除了敌基督的外。因为在圣言中，无论旧约还是新约，祂都被称为耶和华的儿子，至高神的儿子，独生子。因此，父的神性是祂的第一要素，如同人里面的灵魂。由此可知，玛利亚所生的这个儿子就是这神性灵魂的身体，因为在母亲子宫中成长的只是从灵魂成孕并源于灵魂的肉体。所以，这是第二要素。活动构成第三要素，因为活动是由灵魂和身体共同产生的；所产生的任何事物都与产生它的事物同属一个本体。父、子、圣灵这三要素在主里面为一，如同灵魂、身体和活动在人里面为一。主的话明显证明这一点：即父与祂为一，父在祂里面，祂在父里面；还有，祂与圣灵为一，因为圣灵是通过父而从主发出的神性，这一点通过前面（153，154）所引用的圣言已予以充分证明。因此，再次证明它是多余的，就像人已饱足，却还往桌上子摆食物一样。</p>

167. 此三要素——靈魂,身體和活動——曾存於並,仍存在於主上帝拯救者之中, 這是眾所周知的事情。除了敵基督者, 無人會否定祂的靈魂來自於耶和華祂的父。因為在聖言中, 不管舊約新約, 祂都被稱為耶和華的兒子,至高者上帝的兒子,獨生子。因此父的神性是祂的第一要素, 如同一個人的靈魂。接著, 由瑪利亞生出的子就是這個神性靈魂的身體。因為在母親子宮中長成的只是肉體——受孕並源自靈魂。於是, 這是第二要素。活動構成第三要素, 因為是由靈魂與身體共同產生; 所產生的事物與產生它的事物有著同一本質。　
<p>父,子,聖靈這三要素在主之中是一, 如同靈魂,身體和活動在一個人之中。可從主的聲明中清晰明顯地看出:父與祂是一, 父在祂裡面,祂在父裡面。主與聖靈也是一, 因為聖靈是主代表父(或主源自父)而從主發出的神性, 在之前(<a href="153.htm">153-154</a>)已引用聖言充分證明。對此就不必要再次一一列舉證明。 </p>

167. The same three essential components - soul, body, and action - existed and still exist in the Lord God the Savior, as everyone acknowledges. The concept that the Lord's soul came from Jehovah the Father is something only the Antichrist could deny, since the Word of both testaments calls him the Son of Jehovah, the Son of God the Highest, and the only begotten One. The Lord's primary essential component, then, is the Father's divinity, like the soul in us. It follows that the Son whom Mary bore is the body of that divine soul; for what develops in the mother's womb is the body that was conceived by and derived from the soul. This, then, is the second essential component. Actions make a third essential component because they come from both the soul and the body; for things produced have the same essence as the things that produce them.
<p>The three essential components that are Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one in the Lord as our soul, our body, and our actions [are one in us]. This is clear and obvious from the Lord's statement that the Father and he are one, and that the Father is in him and he is in the Father. The Lord is also one with the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit is divinity radiating from the Lord on behalf of the Father, as I have fully shown from the Word in 153 and 154 above. To demonstrate this point again would therefore be an extra serving - it would be burdening the table with food after people are already full. </p>

167. Everyone acknowledges that those three essentials, namely, soul, body and activity, were and are in the Lord God the Saviour. No one but Antichrist can deny that His soul was from Jehovah His Father; for in the Word, in both testaments, He is called the Son of Jehovah, the Son of the Most High God, the Only-begotten. So the Father's Divine is His first essential, as the soul is in man. It follows from this that the Son born to Mary is the body of that Divine soul, for what grows in the mother's womb is simply the body conceived and derived from the soul. So this is the second essential. Activities make up the third essential, since they are produced by the soul and the body working together; and anything so produced is of the same essence as the productive agents. The three essentials, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, make one in the Lord, as the soul, body and activity do in man. This is plainly demonstrated by the Lord's saying that the Father and He are one, and that the Father is in Him and He is in the Father; likewise that He and the Holy Spirit are one, since the Holy Spirit is the Divine which proceeds out of the Lord from the Father, as was fully proved from the Word above (153-154). To prove it again, therefore, would be filling one's stomach <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
to overflowing, and like loading the table with food when one has eaten one's fill.<p>

167. Everyone acknowledges that these three essentials, namely, soul, body, and operation, both were and are in the Lord God the Savior. That His soul was from Jehovah the Father cannot be denied except by Antichrist; for in the Word of both Testaments He is called the Son of Jehovah, the Son of the Most High God, the Only-begotten; consequently the Divine of the Father, like the soul in man, is His first essential. From this it follows that the Son whom Mary brought forth is the body to that Divine soul; for in the mother's womb nothing is furnished except the body that has been conceived and derived from the soul; this, therefore, is His second essential. Operations constitute the third essential, since these proceed from soul and body together, and what proceeds is of the same essence as that which produces it. That the three essentials, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, in the Lord are one, like soul, body, and operation in man, is clearly evident from the Lord's words, that the Father and He are one; that the Father is in Him and He in the Father; and in like manner He and the Holy Spirit, since the Holy Spirit is the Divine that goes forth out of the Lord from the Father, as fully shown above from the Word (n. <a href="153.htm">153, 154</a>); therefore to show it again would be superfluous, and like loading a table with food after the appetite has been satisfied. </p>

167. Quod in Domino Deo Salvatore illa tria Essentialia fuerint et sint, videlicet Anima, Corpus et Operatio, quisque agnoscit; quod Anima Ipsius fuerit a Jehovah Patre, non potest nisi ab Antichristo negari, nam in Verbo utriusque Testamenti vocatur Filius Jehovae, Filius Dei Altissimi, Unigenitus; est itaque Divinum Patris, ut Anima in homine, primum Essentiale Ipsius; quod Filius, quem Maria peperit, sit Corpus Divinae Illius Animae, inde sequitur, non aliud enim quam Corpus ab anima conceptum et derivatum in utero matris paratur, hoc itaque est alterum Essentiale; quod Operationes faciant tertium Essentiale, est quia illae procedunt ex anima et corpore simul, et quae procedunt sunt ejusdem essentiae cum illis quae producunt. Quod tria Essentialia, quae sunt Pater, Filius et Spiritus Sanctus, in Domino unum sint, sicut anima, corpus et operatio in homine, constat manifeste ex Domini verbis, quod Pater et Ipse unum sint, et quod Pater in Ipso et Ipse in Patre; similiter quod Ipse et Spiritus Sanctus, quoniam Spiritus Sanctus est Divinum procedens ex Domino a Patre, ut supra <a href="153.htm">153-154</a>, plene ex Verbo demonstratum est; quare hoc iterum demonstrare, foret rumen superfluum, et sicut onerare mensam cibis post satietatem. </p>
