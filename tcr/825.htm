825. 谁都能从这些圣徒的情况推论出, 祈求圣徒纯粹是笑柄, 而且, 我可以断言, 他们听不见地上的人向他们所作的祈祷, 就象伫立在路两旁的他们的雕像, 或教堂的墙壁, 或在塔上筑巢的鸟儿听不见一样。 在世时曾服侍他们的仆人声称, 圣徒与主耶稣基督在天堂一起统治, 这是他们编造的谎言。 马夫不会与国王一起统治, 看门人不会与领主一起统治, 仆人也不会与大主教一起统治, 同样, 他们不会与主一起统治。 因为洗礼的约翰论到主说, 他就是给祂解鞋带也不配 (<a href="3927/mark_1_7.htm">马可福音1:7</a>;<a href="3927/john_1_27.htm">约翰福音1:27</a>)。 那么, 象这样的人, 又该怎么说呢? </p>

<p>
825. Anyone is in a position to conclude from the state these "saints" are in that praying to the saints is a meaningless activity. Indeed, I can testify that they do not hear prayers that are said to them on earth any more than the statues of them along the roadsides, or the walls of the church, or the birds building their nests in the steeple hear such prayers.
<p>Those on earth who are devoted to the saints say that the saints share in the ruling power of the Lord Jesus Christ in heaven, but this is a fiction; it is completely untrue. They have no greater share in the Lord's power than a stable hand has with a monarch, or a doorkeeper has with a high ranking official, or a courier has with a leader of the church. John the Baptist himself says of the Lord, "I am not worthy to undo the strap of his sandal" (<a href="3927/mark_1_7.htm">Mark 1:7</a>; <a href="3927/john_1_27.htm">John 1:27</a>). How much power can the saints have, then? </p>

825. Knowing that this is their condition, anyone can conclude that invoking them is pure nonsense. Moreover I can assert that they no more hear invocations addressed to them on earth than their statues placed beside roads do, no more than the church walls do, or no more than the birds which nest in the towers. Their servants in the world claim that the saints reign together with the Lord Jesus Christ in heaven; but this is a falsehood they make up. They no more reign with the Lord than a stableman does with a king, a doorkeeper with a lord, or a footman with an archbishop. For John the Baptist said concerning the Lord that he was not worthy to untie the laces of his shoe (<a href="3927/mark_1_7.htm">Mark 1:7</a>; <a href="3927/john_1_27.htm">John 1:27</a>). What then is to be said of people who are like this? </p>

825. From this state of the saints anyone may conclude that the invocation of saints is a mere mockery; and I can affirm, moreover, that they no more hear the invocations addressed to them on earth than do their images by the wayside, or the walls of the church, or the birds building nests in its towers. It is said by those who serve them in the world, that the saints reign in heaven in company with the Lord Jesus Christ; but this is a fiction and fabrication; for they no more reign with the Lord than a groom does with his king, or a porter with a nobleman, or a footman with a primate. For John the Baptist said of the Lord, <p>That he was not worthy to unloose the latchet of His shoes (<a href="3927/mark_1_7.htm">Mark 1:7</a>; <a href="3927/john_1_27.htm">John 1:27</a>). <p>What then can be said of such? </p>

825. Since this is the state of the saints any one can see that their invocation is only a mockery. Moreover, I can assert that they no more hear the invocations addressed to them on earth than do their images by the wayside, or the walls of a church, or the birds that build in its steeple. Their votaries in the world say that the saints reign in heaven together with the Lord Jesus Christ. But this is mere invention; for they no more reign with the Lord than a stableman associates with his king as an equal, or a porter with a nobleman, or a footman with an archbishop. John the Baptist, speaking of the Lord, said,<p>That he was not worthy to unloose the latchet of His shoe, <a href="3927/mark_1_7.htm">Mark 1:7</a>; <a href="3927/john_1_27.htm">John 1:27</a>.<p>What, then, are saints? </p>

825. Ex hoc illorum statu quisque concludere potest, quod Invocationes illorum sint modo ludibria; et insuper asseverare possum, quod Invocationes suas in Terris non plus audiant quam Simulachra eorum juxta vias, nec plus quam parietes Templi; neque plus quam aves nidificantes in turribus. Dicitur a servis illorum in Mundo, quod Sancti una cum Domino Jesu Christo regnent in Coelo, sed hoc est figmentum et commentum; non enim plus regnant cum Domino, quam stabularius cum Rege, quam janitor cum Magnate, ac quam cursor cum Primate; dixit enim Johannes Baptista de Domino, quod non dignus sit solvere corrigiam calcei Ipsius, <a href="3927/mark_1_7.htm">Marcus 1:7</a>; <a href="3927/john_1_27.htm">Johannes 1:27</a> quid tunc illi, qui tales. </p>
