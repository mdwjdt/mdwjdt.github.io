<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>223</b>.（7）拿细耳人代表圣言最外层的大能。我们在士师记读到，参孙自出母胎就是拿细耳人，他的力量就在他的头发里；而且，“拿细耳人”和“拿细耳人的职份”表示头发。参孙的力量就在他的头发里，这是他亲自承认的，当时他说：<br />剃头刀向来就没有上过我的头，，因为我自出母胎就作拿细耳人；若剃了我的头发，我的力气就离开我，我便软弱象别人一样。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/士16.17.htm">士师记16:17</a>）<br />没有人能知道为何要设立表示头发的拿细耳人的职份，为何参孙的力量会在头发里，除非他知道“头”在圣言中的含义。“头”表示世人和天使通过神圣真理从主那里所拥有的聪明；因此，“头发”表示源于神圣真理的最外层或最末层的聪明。正是由于头发的这层含义，拿细耳人才会有这样一条律法：他们不可剃头，因为那是神在他们头上所立的拿细耳人的职份（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.1.htm">民数记6:1</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.21.htm">21</a>）。因此，还有一条律法：大祭司和他的儿子不可剃头，免得他们死亡，又免得震怒临到以色列全家（<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.6.htm">利未记10:6</a>）。鉴于因对应关系而具有这种含义，故头发如此神圣，以致人子，也就是圣言的主，连头发都被描述出来：<br />（祂的头与发）皆白，如白羊毛，如雪。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.14.htm">启示录1:14</a>）<br />亘古常在者也一样（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.9.htm">但以理书7:9</a>）。由于头发表示最外层的真理，因而表示圣言的字义，故在灵界，那些藐视圣言的人都变成秃头。而另一方面，那些高度尊崇圣言，视之为神圣的人，则拥有一头秀发。正是由于这种对应关系，四十二个童子因戏称以利沙为秃头而被两只母熊撕成碎片（<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下2.23.htm">列王纪下2:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下2.24.htm">24</a>）；因为“以利沙”代表取自圣言的教义方面的教会，“母熊”表示真理最外层的能力。神圣真理或圣言的大能就在它的字义里面，因为字义的圣言在其完全中，还因为这是主各国度的天使与世人共有的意义。</p>

223. (7)拿細耳人代表聖言外在意義的能力。
<p>在士師記中我們讀到, 參孫從母腹出來就是拿細耳人, 他的能力在他的頭髮中。還有, "拿細耳人"和"拿細耳人職份"是頭髮的意思。參孫自己表明他的能力在頭髮中, 他說:
<p>向來人沒有用剃頭刀剃我的頭, 因為我自出母胎就歸上帝作拿細耳人; 若剃了我的頭髮, 我的力氣就離開我, 我便軟弱象別人一樣(<a href="3927/judges_16_17.htm">士師記16:17</a>)
<p>除非知道聖言中"頭"所指何意, 那麼沒有人能明白為何要設立拿細耳人的職份(表示頭髮的意思), 為何參孫的力量存於他的頭髮。"頭"表示世人與天人擁有的,藉著神性真理而從主而來的聰明; 因此頭上之"發"表示這由真理而聰明的最外在或最終端部分。正因為這層意義, 對拿細耳人有如此律法:他們不可剃頭發, 這是上帝在他們頭上所立的拿細耳人職份(<a href="3927/numbers_6_1.htm">民數記6:1-21</a>)。因而也是對大祭司和他的眾子的律法, 不可以剃他們的頭髮, 免得他們死, 免得以色列家惹來震怒(<a href="3927/leviticus_10_6.htm">利未記10:6</a>)。因為按其所代表的意義(照著對應關係而有的), "發"如此神聖, 所以人子——就是主(就祂是聖言而言)——被描繪成:頭髮如羊毛, 潔白似雪(<a href="3927/revelation_1_14.htm">啟示錄1:14</a>)。類似的, 在『但以理書』中描寫這位亙古常在者:頭髮如潔淨的羊毛(<a href="3927/daniel_7_9.htm">但以理書7:9</a>)。因為頭髮表示表示真理的最外部, 就是聖言的文字意義, 因此心靈世界中那些蔑視聖言者會變為禿頂。而另一方面, 那些極其尊重聖言並視之神聖者, 顯得髮美動人。因為如此對應的關係, 四十二個少年人被兩隻母熊撕成碎片, 就因他們稱以利沙為禿頭(<a href="3927/2-kings_2_23.htm">列王記下2:23-24</a>)。因為"以利沙"代表教會——關於聖言之教義方面, "母熊"表示真理之最外在部分的能力。神性真理或聖言的能力是在其文字意義之中, 因為在文字意義中, 聖言得以完全; 又因為主國度的天人與人在這文字意義中協調共處。 </p>

223. 7. The Nazirites represented the power of the Word in its outermost form. In the book of Judges we read about Samson. He was a Nazirite from his mother's womb. His hair was the source of his strength. A Nazirite and a Naziriteship in fact mean "hair. " Samson himself showed that his hair was the source of his strength when he said,
<p>No razor has come upon my head, because I am a Nazirite from my mother's womb. If I am shaved, my strength will leave me and I will become weak and be like any other person. (<a href="3927/judges_16_17.htm">Judges 16:17</a>)
<p>Without knowing what a "head" means in the Word, we cannot imagine why a Naziriteship that means "hair" would be instituted or why Samson's hair would be the source of his strength. A head means the intelligence that angels and people have from the Lord through divine truth. Hair, then, means an intelligence because of divine truth on the lowest or outermost level. Since this was the meaning of hair, it was a rule for the Nazirites that they were not to shave the hair on their head, because it was the Naziriteship of God on their head (<a href="3927/numbers_6_1.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>). There was also a rule that the high priest and his sons were not to shave their heads, or they would die and wrath would come upon the entire house of Israel (<a href="3927/leviticus_10_6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>). Hair was so holy because of its meaning (which comes from its correspondence) that even the hair of the Son of Humankind (that is, the Lord in his role as the Word) is described. It was as shining white as wool, like snow (<a href="3927/revelation_1_14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>). The Ancient of Days is described as having similar hair (<a href="3927/daniel_7_9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>).
<p>Since hair means truth on the outermost levels and therefore means the literal meaning of the Word, we become bald in the spiritual world if we despise the Word. On the other hand, if we value the Word highly and hold it as sacred, we will have good-looking hair in that world.
<p>This correspondence is the reason why forty-two youths were torn apart by two she-bears for calling Elisha bald (<a href="3927/2-kings_2_23.htm">2 Kings 2:23-24</a>). Elisha represented the church's teaching from the Word. The she-bears stood for the power of truth on the outermost levels.
<p>The power of divine truth or of the Word exists in its literal meaning because at that level the Word is complete, and people and angels of each of the Lord's kingdoms share in it together. </p>

223. (vii) THE POWER OF THE WORD AT ITS OUTERMOST LEVEL WAS REPRESENTED BY THE NAZIRITES.<p>We read in the Book of Judges that Samson was a Nazirite from his mother's womb, and that his strength lay in his hair. A Nazirite and the fact of being one also means having hair. He himself showed that his strength lay in his hair when he said:<p>A razor has not gone over my head, because I have been a Nazirite from my mother's womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will depart from me, and I shall become weak and be like any other man, <a href="3927/judges_16_17.htm">Judges 16:17</a>.<p>No one can know why the institution of Naziriteship, standing for hair, took place, or why Samson's strength came from his hair, unless he knows the meaning of the head in the Word. The head stands for the intelligence angels and men have from the Lord by means of Divine truth. Thus the hair stands for intelligence derived from Divine truth at the outermost or remotest level. It was this meaning of the hair that caused the rule to be made for Nazirites that they should not shave the hair of their heads, for this is the Naziriteship of God upon their heads (<a href="3927/numbers_6_1.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>). There was also a rule that the highest priest and his sons should not shave their head, lest they die and the whole house of Israel incur anger <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
(<a href="3927/leviticus_10_6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>).</p>
<p>
[2] It was because the hair was sacred on account of its meaning, which is due to its correspondence, that the Son of Man, who is the Lord in respect of the Word, is also described as having hair like wool, white as snow (<a href="3927/revelation_1_14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>), and likewise the Ancient of Days (<a href="3927/daniel_7_9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>). Since the hair means truth at the outermost level, or the literal sense of the Word, those who despise the Word become bald in the spiritual world, while on the other hand those who made much of the Word and held it sacred have a good head of hair. It was because of this correspondence that the forty-two children were torn apart by two she-bears, for calling Elisha bald (<a href="3927/2-kings_2_23.htm">2 Kings 2:23-24</a>); for Elisha represented the church as regards its teaching from the Word, and she-bears stand for the power of truth at the outermost level. The power of Divine truth, or the Word, lies in its literal sense, because the Word is there in all its fulness, and this is the sense possessed alike by the angels of each of the Lord's kingdoms and by men.<p>

223. (7) The power of the Word in its outmosts was represented by the Nazarites. In the book of Judges we read that Samson was a Nazarite from his mother's womb, and that his strength lay in his hair; moreover, "Nazarite" and "Nazariteship" mean the hair. That his strength lay in his hair, he himself showed, when he said: <p>There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite from my mother's womb; if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and I shall be like any other man (<a href="3927/judges_16_17.htm">Judges 16:17</a>). <p>No one can know why the Nazariteship, which means the hair, was instituted, and why Samson's strength lay in his hair, unless he knows what is signified in the Word by the "head." The "head" signifies the intelligence that men and angels have from the Lord through Divine truth; and therefore the "hair" signifies intelligence from Divine truth in things outmost or last. Because of this signification of the "hair" there was a law for the Nazarites: <p>That they should not shave the hair of their head, because that was the Nazariteship of God upon their head (<a href="3927/numbers_6_1.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>). <p>therefore it was also a law, <p>That the high priest and his sons should not shave their heals, lest they die, and lest wrath come upon the whole house of Israel (<a href="3927/leviticus_10_6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>). <p>Because the hair, on account of that signification, which is from correspondence, was so holy, the Son of Man, who is the Lord in respect to the Word, is described even as to the hair: <p>That it was white as white wool, as snow (<a href="3927/revelation_1_14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>). <p>Likewise as the Ancient of Days (<a href="3927/daniel_7_9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>). <p>Because the hair signifies truth in outmosts, thus the sense of the letter of the Word, those in the spiritual world who despise the Word become bald; and on the other hand, those who have held the Word in high esteem and have regarded it as holy appear with comely hair. It was because of this correspondence, <p>That forty-two youths were torn to pieces by two she-bears, because they called Elisha bald-head (<a href="3927/2-kings_2_23.htm">Kings 2:23, 24</a>); <p>for "Elisha" represented the church in regard to doctrine from the Word, and "she-bears" signify the power of truth in outmosts. The power of Divine truth or of the Word is in the sense of its letter, because there the Word is in its fullness, and because the angels of both of the Lord's kingdoms and men are together in that sense. </p>

223. (7) THE POWER OF THE WORD IN ULTIMATES WAS REPRESENTED BY THE NAZIRITES. <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
<p>We read in the Book of Judges concerning Samson, that he was a Nazirite from his mother's womb, and that his strength lay in his hair. Moreover, by Nazirite and Naziriteship is signified hair. He himself made it clear that his strength lay in his hair, when he said:<p>"There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazirite from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man" <a href="3927/judges_16_17.htm">Judges 16:17</a>.<p>No one can possibly know why the Naziriteship, by which is signified hair, was instituted, and why Samson's strength lay in his hair, unless he knows what is signified by the head in the Word. The head signifies intelligence, which angels and men possess from the Lord by means of Divine Truth. Hair, therefore, signifies intelligence from Divine Truth in ultimates or extremes. Because this was signified by hair it was therefore ordained as a law for the Nazirites,<p>that they should not shave the hair of their head, because it was the Naziriteship of God upon their head. <a href="3927/numbers_6_1.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>.<p>For the same reason it was also ordained:<p> the High Priest and his son should not shave their head, lest they should die, and wrath should come upon the whole house of Israel. <a href="3927/leviticus_10_8.htm">Leviticus 10:8</a>.<p>Since the hair, on account of this signification grounded in correspondence, was so holy, therefore the Son of Man, who is the Lord as to the Word, is described even to His hairs, which:<p>"were white like wool, as white as snow" <a href="3927/revelation_1_14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>.<p>So also the Ancient of Days is described, in <a href="3927/daniel_7_9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>.<p>Since the hair signifies truth in ultimates, thus the sense of the Letter of the Word, therefore those who despise the Word in the spiritual world become bald; while on the contrary, those who have honored the Word and regarded it as holy, appear with beautiful hair. It was on account of this correspondence:<p> the forty-two children who called Elisha bald-head, were torn to pieces by two she-bears. <a href="3927/2-kings_2_23.htm">2 Kings 2:23-24</a>.<p>For Elisha represented the Church as to doctrine from the Word, and she-bears signify the power of truth in ultimates. The power of Divine Truth, or the Word, is in the sense of the Letter, because the Word in that sense is in its fulness, and the angels of the Lord's two kingdoms and men are simultaneously in that sense.<p>

223. VII. QUOD POTENTIA VERBI IN ULTIMIS, REPRAESENTATA SIT PER NAZIRAEOS. Legitur in Libro Judicum, de Simsone, quod Naziraeus esset ab utero matris, et quod Potentia ejus constaret in Crinibus; per Naziraeum et Naziraeatum <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
etiam significatur Crinis; quod Potentia ejus in Crinibus consisteret, manifestavit ipse, dicens, Novacula non ascendit super Caput meum, quia Naziraeus ego ab utero matris meae; si rador, <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
tunc recedet a me robur meum, et reddar infirmus, et ero sicut quivis homo, <a href="3927/judges_16_17.htm">Judicum 16:17</a>. Nemo scire potest, cur Naziraeatus, per quem significatur Crinis, institutus est, et unde est, quod Simsoni fuerit robur ex Crinibus, nisi sciat quid per Caput in Verbo significatur; per Caput significatur Intelligentia, quae est Angelis et Hominibus a Domino per Divinum Verum, inde per Crines significatur intelligentia in ultimis seu extremis ex Divino Vero. Quia hoc per Crines significabatur, ideo statutum pro Naziraeis erat, Quod non raderent comam Capitis sui, quia illa est Naziraeatus Dei super Capite eorum, <a href="3927/numbers_6_1.htm">Numeri 6:1-21</a>; et quoque ideo statutum est, Quod Summus Sacerdos, ac Filii ejus, non raderent Caput suum, ne morerentur, ac universa Domus Israelis irasceretur, <a href="3927/leviticus_10_6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>.</p>
