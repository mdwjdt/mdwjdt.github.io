<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>85</b>. （2）祂作为神圣真理，就是圣言（即道）降下来，然而祂并未将神圣良善与神圣真理分离。有两个要素构成神的本质，即圣爱与圣智，或也可说，圣善与圣真。这二者是神的本质，这在前面已说明（36－48节）。此外，这二者就是圣言中“耶和华神”之名所表示的。“耶和华”表圣爱或圣善，“神”表圣智或圣真；因此，这两个名字在圣言中各有不同；经上有时只用“耶和华”这个名，有时只用“神”这个名：当论述圣善时，用“耶和华”之名，当论述圣真时，则用“神”之名，当论述这二者时，则用“耶和华神”之名。从约翰福音明显可知，耶和华神作为圣真，就是圣言（即道）降下来：<br />太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神；万物藉着祂造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的。道成了肉身，住在我们中间。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">约翰福音1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />圣言（即道）表神圣真理的原因在于，教会所拥有的圣言就是神圣真理本身。因为圣言是耶和华自己口授的，而耶和华所口授的，是纯全的神圣真理，不可能是别的什么。<br />不过，圣言因经由天堂降至尘世，故既适合天堂中的天使，也适合世人。所以，圣言既包含圣真在其中被光照的属灵之义，也包含圣真在其中处于阴影的属世之义。因此，约翰福音中这些经文所表示的是我们圣言中的神圣真理。这也可从主降世应验圣言的全部明显可知。这就是为何我们多次读到，发生在祂身上的这样或那样的事是为了“成就经书”（参看262节）。“弥赛亚”或“基督”，或“人子”，或主离世后派出的“圣灵保惠师”无非表示圣真。主于山上在三个门徒面前变像（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.1.htm">马太福音17:1</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.2.htm">马可福音9:2</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.28.htm">路加福音9:28</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.36.htm">36</a>），在约翰面前变像（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.12.htm">启示录1:12</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.16.htm">16</a>）时，祂就代表作为圣言的祂自己，这可见于圣经那一章（222节）。<br />从主的话明显可知，祂在世时就是神圣真理：<br />我就是道路，真理，生命。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">约翰福音14:6</a>）<br />还有：<br />我们也知道神的儿子已经来到，且将智慧赐给我们，使我们认识那位真实的，我们也在那位真实的里面，就是在祂儿子耶稣基督里面。这是真神，也是永生。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约壹5.20.htm">约翰一书5:20</a>）<br />这也可通过祂被称为“光”进一步来说明，如以下经文：<br />祂是真光，照亮一切生在世上的人。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.4.htm">约翰福音1:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.9.htm">9</a>）<br />耶稣说，光在你们中间还有不多的时候。你们应当趁着有光行走，免得黑暗临到你们。你们应当趁着有光，信从这光，使你们成为光明之子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.35.htm">约翰福音12:35</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.36.htm">36</a>）<br />我是世上的光。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.5.htm">约翰福音9:5</a>）<br />西面说，我的眼睛已经看见你的救恩，是启示列族的光。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.30.htm">路加福音2:30</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.32.htm">32</a>）<br />定他们的罪就在此，光来到世间；行真理的必来就光。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.19.htm">约翰福音3:19</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.21.htm">21</a>）<br />“光”表示神圣真理。</p>

85. (2)祂作為聖理(也就是"道")降世, 聖善並未與聖理分離。
<p>上帝的本質包括兩樣:聖仁和聖智; 或者同樣的, 聖善和聖理(參閱第<a href="36.htm">36-48</a>節)。這兩樣在聖言中可用"耶和華上帝"來表達:"耶和華"表示聖仁或聖善, "上帝"則表示聖智或聖理。這就是為何這兩個名字會出現在聖言的不同地方。有時只出現耶和華, 有時只出現上帝。當某處想表達聖善之意時, 就用耶和華這個名字。當表達聖理時, 就用上帝這個名。當兩者都表達時, 祂就被稱為耶和華上帝了。
<p>耶和華上帝作為聖理(就是道)而降世, 可明顯從『約翰福音』中看出:太初有道, 道與上帝同在, 道是上帝; 萬物藉著祂被造, 沒有什麼不是藉著祂造的。道成肉身, 住在我們中間。(<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">約翰福音1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>)為什麼"道(Word)"在這裡表示聖理？因為教會所擁有的聖言(Word)就是神性真理本身, 是由耶和華自己所說的。耶和華的話不是別的什麼, 就是純全的聖理。[2]然而, 由於聖言經過天國到世上, 既能被天國的天人接受, 又要讓世人明白。因此, 聖言包含屬靈的意義, 在這層意思裡, 聖理如同在光亮之中顯明。聖言還有屬世的意思, 聖理在其中就如同在隱蔽處。聖理在聖言中, 就是『約翰福音』這些經句所表達的意思。
<p>主降世並應驗了聖言中的所有事情, 這個事實可更加清楚地表達這層意思。這就是為何在聖言中多處說到祂所做事情就是為了應驗經上所說的(詳見第<a href="262.htm">262</a>節)。
<p>"彌賽亞"或"基督"除了聖理,並不表示別的意思, "人子"也是如此, 主離開後差遣來的"聖靈保惠師"也是此意。山上向祂的三個門徒變像(Matthew 17:1-13;Mark 9:2-13;<a href="3927/luke_9_28.htm">路加福音9:28-36</a>), 以及啟示錄向約翰變像(<a href="3927/revelation_1_12.htm">啟示錄1:12-16</a>), 那時祂自己的形像就代表聖理, 在第三章<a href="222.htm">222</a>節關於聖言部分會談到。
<p>[3]從主自己的話也可看出, 祂在世上就是聖理:我是道路,真理和生命(<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">約翰福音14:6</a>); 我們知道, 上帝的兒子已經來到, 且將智慧賜給我們, 使我們認識那位真實的(true, 是truth"真理"的形容詞形式), 我們也在那位真實的裡面, 就是在祂兒子耶穌基督裡面。這是真上帝, 也是永生(<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">約翰一書5:20</a>)。
<p>在聖言中祂被稱為"光", 這個事實也更能說明問題, 請看:祂是真光, 照亮一切生在世上的人(<a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">約翰福音1:4</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>)。 <p>耶穌說:"光與你們同在的時候很少了。只要有光就行走, 免得黑暗臨到你們。你們有光時, 信這光, 這樣你們可成為光的兒子"(<a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">約翰福音12:35-36</a>)。我是世上的光(<a href="3927/john_9_5.htm">約翰福音9:5</a>)。西面說:"我的雙眼已經看到禰的拯救, 啟示萬民的光"(<a href="3927/luke_2_30.htm">路加福音2:30-32</a>)。光來到世間; 行真理的必來就光。(<a href="3927/john_3_19.htm">約翰福音3:19-21</a>)還有其他的經句。"光"表示聖理。 </p>

85. 2. Jehovah God came down as the divine truth, which is the Word; but he did not separate the divine goodness from it. Two things constitute the essence of God: divine love and divine wisdom; or, what is the same, divine goodness and divine truth. (Above at 3648 we showed that these two constitute the essence of God.) The expression "Jehovah God" in the Word means these two qualities. "Jehovah" means divine love or divine goodness; "God" means divine wisdom or divine truth. This is why these names occur in various ways in the Word. At times just Jehovah is named; at other times, just God. When the subject is divine goodness he is called Jehovah. When the subject is divine truth he is called God. When both are involved he is called Jehovah God.
<p>It is clear from John that Jehovah God came down as divine truth, which is the Word:
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by it, and nothing that was made came about without it. And the Word became flesh and lived among us. (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>)
<p>"The Word" in this passage means divine truth because the Word that exists in the church is divine truth itself. The Word was dictated by Jehovah himself, and what Jehovah dictates is pure divine truth - it cannot be anything else.
</p>
<p>
[2] Nevertheless, because it passed all the way through the heavens into the world, it became adapted to angels in heaven and also to people in the world. As a result, in the Word there is a spiritual meaning in which divine truth is in the light and there is an earthly meaning in which divine truth is in shadow. The divine truth in this Word is what was meant in John.
<p>This is clearer still from the fact that the Lord came into the world to fulfill all the things in the Word. This is why it says many times that this or that happened to him in order to fulfill Scripture [see 262]. Divine truth is precisely what "the Messiah" and "Christ" mean, what "the Son of Humankind" means, and what the Comforter, the Holy Spirit that the Lord sent after his death means. During his transfiguration on the mountain before his three disciples (Matthew 17[:1-13]; Mark 9[:2-13]; Luke 9[:28-36]) and also during his transfiguration before John in , the Lord represented himself as the Word, as we will see in the chapter below on Sacred Scripture [222].
</p>
<p>
[3] From the Lord's own words it is clear that he was present in the world as divine truth: "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>). This is also clear from these words: "We know that the Son of God came and gave us understanding so that we would know the truth. And we are in the truth in the Son of God, Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life" (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>).
<p>This becomes still clearer from the fact that he is called the light, as in these passages:
<p>He was the true light that enlightens everyone who comes into the world. (<a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">John 1:9</a>)
<p>Jesus said, "For a brief time the light is still with you. Walk while you have the light so the darkness will not overtake you. While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may become children of the light. " (<a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">John 12:35-36</a>)
<p>I am the light of the world. (<a href="3927/john_9_5.htm">John 9:5</a>)
<p>Simeon said, "My eyes have seen your salvation, a light of revelation to the nations. " (<a href="3927/luke_2_30.htm">Luke 2:30</a>, <a href="3927/luke_2_32.htm">32</a>)
<p>This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world. Those who do the truth come toward the light. (<a href="3927/john_3_19.htm">John 3:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_21.htm">21</a>)
<p>There are other such passages as well. "The light" means divine truth. </p>

85. (ii) JEHOVAH GOD CAME DOWN AS THE DIVINE TRUTH, WHICH IS THE WORD, YET HE DID NOT SEPARATE THE DIVINE GOOD FROM IT.<p>There are two factors which make up the essence of God, the Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom, or, what is the same thing, the Divine Good and the Divine Truth. This dual essence of God was proved above (<a href="36.htm">36-48</a>). The same pair is meant in the Word by Jehovah God; Jehovah means the Divine Love or the Divine Good, God the Divine Wisdom or the Divine Truth. Hence these terms are distinguished in various ways in the Word; at one point only Jehovah is named, at another only God. Where the subject is the Divine Good, the name Jehovah is used, where it is the Divine Truth, God; and where both are meant, He is called Jehovah God. It is evident from John that Jehovah God came down as the Divine Truth, which is the Word:<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; all things were made through Him, and without Him was nothing made that was made. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>The reason why the Word there means the Divine Truth is that the Word possessed by the church is Divine Truth itself, for it was dictated by Jehovah Himself, and what Jehovah dictates is pure Divine Truth and could not be anything else.</p>

<p>
[2] But because the Word passed through the heavens in its descent to the world, it was made suitable for angels in heaven, and for men in the world. So the Word contains a spiritual sense, in which the Divine Truth is illuminated, and a natural sense, in which the Divine Truth is in shadow. So what is meant in John is the Divine Truth in this Word. This is also plain from the Lord's coming into the world to fulfil everything in the Word. This is why we read so many times that this or that happened to Him 'that the scripture might be fulfilled.' Nothing but the Divine Truth too is meant by 'the Messiah' or 'Christ', or by 'the Son of Man', or by 'the Holy Spirit the Comforter', which the Lord sent after He left the world. In His transfiguration before the three disciples on the mountain (<a href="3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17</a>, <a href="3927/mark_9_1.htm">Mark 9</a> and <a href="3927/luke_9_1.htm">Luke 9</a>), and before John in Revelation (<a href="3927/revelation_1_12.htm">Revelation 1:12-16</a>), He represented Himself as that Word, as will be seen in the chapter on the Holy Scripture [<a href="222.htm">222</a>].</p>
<p>
[3] It is plain from the Lord's words that in the world He was the Divine Truth:<p>I am the way, truth and life, <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>.<p>and:<p>We know that the Son of God came and gave us understanding so that we might know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true in His Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God, and everlasting life. <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>.<p>This is also shown by His being called 'light', as in these passages, among others:<p>He was the true light which illuminates every man coming into the world, <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">John 1:4</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>.<p>Jesus said, For a short while yet the light is with you. Walk so long as you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. So long as you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may be sons of light, <a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">John 12:35-36</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>.<p>I am the light of the world, <a href="3927/john_9_5.htm">John 9:5</a>.<p>Simeon said, My eyes have seen your salvation, a light to be a revelation to the nations, <a href="3927/luke_2_30.htm">Luke 2:30-32</a>.<p>This is the judgment, that the light came into the world; he who does the truth, comes to the light, <a href="3927/john_3_19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>.<p>Light means the Divine Truth. </p>

85. (2) Jehovah God descended as Divine Truth, which is the Word, although He did not separate from it the Divine Good. There are two things that constitute the essence of God, the Divine love and the Divine wisdom, or what is the same, Divine good and Divine truth. That these two are the essence of God has been shown above (n. <a href="36.htm">36-48</a>). Moreover these two are what are meant in the Word by the name "Jehovah God," "Jehovah" meaning the Divine love or Divine good, and "God" the Divine wisdom or Divine truth; and for this reason these two names are distinguished in the Word in various ways; sometimes the name "Jehovah" alone is used, and sometimes the name "God" alone-the name "Jehovah" when the Divine good is treated of, and the name "God" when the Divine truth is treated of; and the name "Jehovah God" when both are treated of. That Jehovah God descended as the Divine truth, which is the Word, is shown in John as follows: <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not any thing made that was made. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among, us (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>). <p>By "the Word" here the Divine truth is meant; because the Word, which is in the church, is Divine truth itself, for it was dictated by Jehovah Himself; and what is dictated by Jehovah is nothing but Divine truth, and can be nothing else.
</p>
<p>
[2] But inasmuch as the Divine truth passed down through the heavens even to the world, it became adapted to angels in heaven and also to men in the world. For this reason there is in the Word a spiritual sense in which the Divine truth is seen in clear light, and a natural sense in which it is seen obscurely. Thus it is the Divine truth in our Word that is here meant in John. This is made still clearer by the fact that the Lord came into the world to fulfill all things of the Word; and this is why it is so often said that this or that was done to Him "that the Scripture might be fulfilled." Nor is anything but the Divine truth meant by "the Messiah" or "the Christ," or "the Son of man," or "the Holy Spirit the Comforter," which the Lord sent after His departure. In the chapter on the Sacred Scripture it will be shown that in His transfiguration before the three disciples on the mount (Matthew 17; Mark 9; Luke 9), and also before John in the Apocalypse (<a href="3927/revelation_1_12.htm">1:12-16</a>), the Lord represented Himself as that Word.
</p>
<p>
[3] That the Lord in the world was the Divine truth is evident from His own words: <p>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>); <p>also from these words: <p>We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding that we may know the True; and we are in the True, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>); <p>and still further by His being called "the Light," as in the following passages: <p>There was the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world (<a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">John 1:4</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>). <p>Jesus said, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not. While ye have the light believe in the light, that ye may be sons of light (<a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">John 12:35-36</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>). <p>I am the light of the world (<a href="3927/john_9_5.htm">John 9:5</a>). <p>Simeon said, For mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, a light for revelation to the Gentiles (<a href="3927/luke_2_30.htm">Luke 2:30-32</a>). <p>And this is the judgment, that light is come into the world; he that doeth the truth cometh to the light (<a href="3927/john_3_19.htm">John 3:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_21.htm">21</a>); <p>besides other places. "Light" means the Divine truth. </p>

85. (2) JEHOVAH GOD DESCENDED AS THE DIVINE TRUTH, WHICH IS THE WORD; AND YET HE DID NOT SEPARATE THE DIVINE GOOD.<p>There are two things which constitute the Essence of God: Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, or what is the same, Divine Good and Divine Truth. It has been shown above in numbers 36-48, that these two are the Essence of God. These two are also meant in the Word by Jehovah God: by Jehovah is meant the Divine Love or the Divine Good, and by God the Divine Wisdom or the Divine Truth. Therefore it is that in the Word they are distinguished in various ways; at one time the name Jehovah is used alone, at another time the name God; for when the Divine Good is treated, the name Jehovah is used, and when the Divine Truth is the subject the name God is used; while when both are being treated, the expression Jehovah God is used. That Jehovah God descended as the Divine Truth, which is the Word, is evident from this passage in John, where it is said:<p>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... All things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made... And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us" <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>By the Word is there meant Divine Truth, because the Word, which is received in the Church, is Divine Truth itself, for it was dictated by Jehovah Himself; and what is dictated by Jehovah is Divine Truth in its purity, and can be nothing else.</p>
<p>
[2] As the Word passed through the heavens down to this world, it was accommodated to the angels in heaven and also to men in the world. There is thus in the Word at spiritual sense, in which the Divine Truth appears in clear light, and a natural sense, in which the Divine Truth is but dimly seen. Therefore it is the Divine Truth in this Word that is meant in John. Moreover, this is evident from this consideration that the Lord came into the world to fulfil all things in the Word; and for this reason we so often read that this or that was done by Him that the Scripture might be fulfilled. The Divine Truth is also meant by the Messiah or Christ, by the Son of Man, and by the Holy Spirit the Comforter, whom the Lord sent after His departure from the world.<p>It will be seen in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture that the Lord represented Himself as that Word in the Transfiguration on the Mount before His three disciples, <a href="3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17</a>; <a href="3927/mark_9_1.htm">Mark 9</a>; and <a href="3927/luke_9_1.htm">Luke 9</a>; and also before John in the <a href="3927/revelation_1_12.htm">Revelation 1:12-16</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] That the Lord, when in the world, was the Divine Truth, is evident from His words:<p>"I am the way, and the truth, and the life" <a href="3927/john_14_8.htm">John 14:8</a>; and from these words:<p>"We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know the truth (A.V., him that is true); and we are in the truth (A.V., him that is true), even in His Son Jesus Christ, This is the true God and eternal life" <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>.<p>It is still further evident from the fact that He is called the Light, as in these passages:<p>"That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world" <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">John 1:4</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>.<p>"Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you... While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light" <a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">John 12:35-36</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_48.htm">48</a>.<p>"I am the light of the world" <a href="3927/john_9_5.htm">John 9:5</a>.<p>Simeon said: "Mine eyes have seen thy salvation,... a light to lighten the Gentiles" <a href="3927/luke_2_30.htm">Luke 2:30</a>, <a href="3927/luke_2_32.htm">32</a>.<p>"This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,... But he that doeth truth cometh to the light" <a href="3927/john_3_19.htm">John 3:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_21.htm">21</a>.<p>and other passages might be quoted where by light is meant the Divine Truth. </p>

85. II. QUOD JEHOVAH DEUS DESCENDERIT UT DIVINUM VERUM, QUOD EST VERBUM, ET TAMEN QUOD NON SEPARAVERIT DIVINUM BONUM. Sunt duo quae faciunt Essentiam Dei, Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia, seu quod idem est, Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum; quod Essentia Dei sint illa duo, supra <a href="36.htm">36-48</a>, demonstratum est. Illa duo in Verbo intelliguntur etiam per JEHOVAM <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
DEUM, per Jehovam Divinus Amor seu Divinum Bonum, et per Deum Divina Sapientia seu Divinum Verum, inde est quod in Verbo distinguantur variis modis, et nunc solum nominetur Jehovah, nunc solum Deus, ubi enim agitur de Divino Bono, ibi dicitur Jehovah, et ubi de Divino Vero, ibi Deus, et ubi de utroque, ibi Jehovah Deus. Quod Jehovah Deus descenderit ut Divinum Verum, quod est Verbum, constat apud Johannem, ubi haec, "In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum, omnia per Ipsum facta sunt, et sine Ipso factum est nihil quod factum est. Et Verbum Caro factum est, et habitavit inter nos," <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>: <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
quod per Verbum ibi intelligatur Divinum Verum, est quia Verbum, quod in Ecclesia est, est ipsum Divinum Verum, est enim ab Ipso Jehovah dictatum, et quod a Jehovah dictatur est pure Divinum Verum, nec potest esse aliud;</p>
<p>
[2] sed quia illud transivit Coelos usque in Mundum, accommodatum factum est Angelis in Coelo, et quoque hominibus in Mundo; inde inest Verbo sensus spiritualis, in quo Divinum Verum est in luce, et sensus naturalis in quo Divinum Verum est in umbra; quare Divinum Verum in hoc Verbo est quod apud Johannem intelligitur: hoc adhuc patet ex eo, quod Dominus in Mundum venerit, ut impleret omnia Verbi, quare toties legitur, quod hoc et illud Ipsi factum sit, ut impleretur Scriptura. Nec aliud quam Divinum Verum per Messiam seu Christum, nec aliud per Filium hominis, neque aliud per Paracletum Spiritum Sanctum, quem Dominus post exitum suum misit, intelligitur. Quod in Transformatione coram tribus Discipulis super monte, <a href="3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthaeus 17</a>, <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
<a href="3927/mark_9_1.htm">Marcus 9</a>, et <a href="3927/luke_9_1.htm">Luca 9</a>, et quoque coram Johanne in <a href="3927/revelation_1_12.htm">Apocalypsi 1:12-16</a>, Se ut Verbum illud repraesentaverit, in Capite de SCRIPTURA SACRA, videbitur.</p>
<p>
[3] Quod Dominus in Mundo fuerit Divinum Verum, patet ex his Ipsius verbis, Ego sum Via, VERITAS, et Vita, <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">Johannes 14:6</a>, et ex his, Scimus quod Filius Dei venerit, et dederit nobis Intellectum, ut cognoscamus VERITATEM, et sumus in VERITATE, IN FILIO IPSIUS JESU CHRISTO: Hic est verus Deus, et vita aeterna, <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 Johannes 5:20</a>. <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
Et adhuc per quod dicatur Lux, ut in his locis, "LUX VERA erat, quae illuminat omnem hominem venientem in Mundum, <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">Johannes 1:4</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>. Jesus dixit, adhuc breve tempus LUX VOBISCUM est; ambulate quousque LUCEM habetis, ne tenebrae vos apprehendant: quousque LUCEM habetis, credite in LUCEM, ut FILII LUCIS SITIS, <a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">Johannes 12:35-36</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>. EGO LUX MUNDI SUM, <a href="3927/john_9_5.htm">Johannes 9:5</a>. Simeon dixit, viderunt oculi mei Salutare tuum, LUCEM in revelationem gentium, <a href="3927/luke_2_30.htm">Luca 2:30-32</a>. Hoc est judicium, quod LUX VENIT IN MUNDUM; QUI FACIT VERITATEM, VENIT AD LUCEM," <a href="3927/john_3_19.htm">Johannes 3:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_21.htm">21</a>, praeter alibi; per Lucem intelligitur Divinum Verum.<p>
