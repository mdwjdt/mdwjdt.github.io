705. Passages in the Word that mention these four things - flesh, blood, bread, and wine - show that they mean the spiritual and heavenly things to which they correspond.
<p>For example, we can see from the following passages that flesh in the Word means something spiritual and heavenly.
<p>Come and gather for the feast of the great God, that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders, the flesh of the mighty, the flesh of horses and those who ride on them, and the flesh of all people, free and slaves, small and great. (<a href="3927/revelation_19_17.htm">Revelation 19:17-18</a>)
<p>And in Ezekiel,
<p>Gather yourselves from all sides to my sacrificial meal, which I will sacrifice for you, a great sacrificial meal on the mountains of Israel, so that you will eat flesh and drink blood. You will eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the leaders of the earth. At my sacrificial meal, you will eat fat until you are full and you will drink blood until you are drunk. You will be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with the mighty and all the men of war. This is how I will present my glory among the nations. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17-21</a>)
<p>Surely everyone sees that in the passages just quoted flesh does not mean flesh and blood does not mean blood; they mean things that are spiritual and heavenly that correspond to them. Otherwise what else would these be but astoundingly nonsensical statements? Are people really going to eat the flesh of kings and commanders, the flesh of the mighty, and the flesh of horses and those who ride on them? Are they really going to be filled up at the table by eating horses, chariots, the mighty, and all the men of war? Are they really going to drink the blood of the leaders of the earth, and drink blood until they are drunk? Clearly, these statements concern the Lord's Holy Supper, as we can tell because of the mention of "the feast of the great God" and "a great sacrificial meal. "
</p>
<p>
[2] Since all things that are spiritual and heavenly relate exclusively to goodness and truth, it follows that flesh means good action that relates to goodwill and blood means truth that relates to faith. On the highest level, these words mean the divine goodness of the Lord's love and the divine truth of the Lord's wisdom.
<p>In the following passage in Ezekiel, flesh again means spiritual goodness.
<p>I will give them one heart, and I will create a new spirit within you. I will remove their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_11_19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_36_26.htm">36:26</a>)
<p>In the Word, "heart" means love. Therefore a heart of flesh means a love for what is good.
<p>The passages cited below on the meaning of bread and wine [707-708] make it clearer still that flesh and blood mean spiritual goodness and spiritual truth, since the Lord indicates that his flesh is bread and his blood is wine that we drink from a cup. </p>

705. The four items, flesh, blood, bread and wine, mean spiritual and celestial things corresponding to them, as can be established from the passages in the Word where they are mentioned. Flesh in the Word has a spiritual and celestial meaning, as can be established from the following passages:<p>Come and gather for the feast of the great God <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
, to eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of strong men, and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all free men and slaves, both small and great, <a href="3927/revelation_19_17.htm">Revelation 19:17-18</a>.<p>And in Ezekiel:<p>Gather from round about to my sacrifice, the great sacrifice that I am making for you upon the mountains of Israel; that you may eat the flesh and drink the blood. You will eat the flesh of strong men and drink the blood of the princes of the earth. You will eat fat from my sacrifice until you are glutted, and drink blood until you are drunk. And you will be sated at my table with horse and chariot, with the strong man and every man of war. Thus shall I set my glory among the nations, <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17-21</a>.<p>Anyone can see that in those passages flesh does not mean flesh, neither does blood mean blood, but the spiritual and celestial things corresponding to them. What otherwise would be the meaning - unless they were meaningless and extraordinary expressions - of eating the flesh of kings, captains, strong men, horses and them that sat on them, of being sated at the table with horse, chariot, a strong man and every man of war? Or of drinking the blood of the princes of the earth, and drinking blood until one is drunk? It is perfectly clear that these things are said about the Lord's Holy Supper, for the feast <sup "fn10_2">2</sup>
of the great God, and also the great sacrifice, are mentioned.</p>
<p>
[2] Since all spiritual and celestial things have reference exclusively to good and truth, it follows that flesh means the good of charity and blood the truth of faith; and in the highest sense the Lord in respect of the Divine good of love and in respect of the Divine truth of wisdom. Flesh also means spiritual good in these words of Ezekiel:<p>I shall give them one heart, and I shall put a new spirit in your midst, and I shall take away the heart of stone, and give them a heart of flesh, <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_36_26.htm">36:26</a>.<p>Heart in the Word stands for love, so a heart of flesh stands for the love of good. Moreover, it is more fully established that flesh and blood mean spiritual good and spiritual truth from the meaning of bread and wine in the next section, since the Lord says that His flesh is bread and His blood is wine, which was drunk from a cup.<p>

705. That these four, flesh, blood, bread, and wine, mean the spiritual and celestial things that correspond to them, can be seen from the passages in the Word where they are mentioned. That "flesh" means in the Word what is spiritual and celestial can be seen from the following passages: <p>Come and be gathered together unto the supper of the great God that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders of thousands, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great (<a href="3927/revelation_19_17.htm">Revelation 19:17, 18</a>). <p>And in Ezekiel: <p>Gather yourselves from every side to My sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood. Ye shall eat the flesh of the strong, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth; and ye shall eat fat to satiety, and drink blood even to drunkenness, of My sacrifice; and ye shall be satisfied at my table with horse and with chariot, with the mighty man, and with every man of war; and I will set My glory among the heathen (<a href="3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">39:17-21</a>). <p>Who does not see that in these passages "flesh" and "blood" do not mean flesh and blood, but the spiritual and celestial things which correspond to them? Otherwise, what would these statements be; that they should eat the flesh of kings, commanders of thousands, mighty men, and horses, and of those that sat on them, and that they should be satisfied at the table with horses, chariots, mighty men and all men of war, and that they should drink the blood of the princes of the earth, and should drink blood even to drunkenness, but unmeaning and strange expressions? That these words are applied to the holy supper of the Lord is very clear, for the supper of the great God is mentioned, and also the great sacrifice. As all spiritual and celestial things have relation solely to good and truth, it follows that "flesh" means the good of charity, and "blood" the truth of faith, and in the highest sense, the Lord in respect to the Divine good of love and the Divine truth of wisdom. "Flesh" also means spiritual good in the following passage in Ezekiel: <p>I will give them one heart, and I will give a new spirit in the midst of you; and I will take away the heart of stone out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh (<a href="3927/ezekiel_11_19.htm">11:19</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_36_26.htm">26:26</a>). <p>In the Word "heart" signifies love; therefore "a heart of flesh" signifies a love of good. That "flesh and blood" mean good and truth, both spiritual, is still further evident from the signification of "bread and wine" in what now follows; for the Lord says that His flesh is bread, and that His blood is the wine that was drunk from the cup. </p>

705. That these four, flesh, blood, bread and wine, mean spiritual and celestial things which correspond to them, may be evident from the passages in the Word where they are mentioned. That flesh means in the Word something spiritual and celestial may be evident from these passages:<p>"Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great" <a href="3927/revelation_19_17.htm">Revelation 19:17-18</a>;<p>And in Ezekiel:<p>"Gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood. Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth... And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice... Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, and with all men of war... And I will set my glory among the nations (A.V., heathen)" <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">39:17-21</a>.<p>Every one perceives that flesh in these passages does not mean flesh, and that blood does not mean blood, but the spiritual and celestial things which correspond to them. Otherwise, what but meaningless and strange expressions would these be, that they should eat the flesh of kings, of captains, of mighty men, of horses, and of them that sit on them; and that they should be filled at His table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war; and that they should drink the blood of the princes of the earth, and drink blood till they were drunken?<p>It is clear that these things are said of the Holy Supper of the Lord, for the feast is called the supper of the great God, and also a great sacrifice. Now, as all spiritual and celestial things have relation solely to good and truth, it follows that flesh means the good of charity, and blood the truth of faith; and in the highest sense, the Lord as to the Divine Good of Love and the Divine Truth of Wisdom. Spiritual good is also meant by flesh in these words in Ezekiel:<p>"I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take away the stony heart... and will give them an heart of flesh" <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_19.htm">11:19</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_36_26.htm">36:26</a>.<p>In the Word heart means love; therefore, the love of good is meant by a heart of flesh. Moreover, that flesh and blood mean good and truth, both spiritual, is still more evident from the signification of bread and wine in the Lord's declaration that His flesh is bread, and that His blood is the wine which was drunk from the cup. </p>

705. Quod per quatuor illa, Carnem, Sanguinem, Panem et Vinum, intelligantur Spiritualia et Coelestia, quae illis correspondent, constare potest ex locis in Verbo, ubi nominantur. Quod per CARNEM in Verbo intelligatur Spirituale et coeleste, constare potest ex his locis ibi, "Venite et congregamini ad COENAM MAGNI DEI, ut comedatis Carnes regum, et Carnes chiliarchorum, et Carnes fortium, et Carnes equorum, et sedentium super illis, et Carnes omnium liberorum et servorum, et parvorum et magnorum," <a href="3927/revelation_19_17.htm">Apocalypsis 19:17-18</a>. Et apud Ezechielem, "Congregate vos a circuitu super SACRIFICIUM MEUM, quod sacrifico vobis, SACRIFICIUM MAGNUM super montibus Israelis, ut comedatis Carnem, et bibatis Sanguinem: Carnem fortium comedetis, et Sanguinem principum terrae bibetis; et comedetis adipem ad satietatem, et bibetis Sanguinem usque ad ebrietatem de Sacrificio meo; et satiabimini super mensa mea, equo et curru, forti et omni viro belli. Sic dabo gloriam meam inter gentes." <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">39:17-21</a>. Quis non videt, quod in illis locis per Carnem non intelligatur Caro, nec per Sanguinem Sanguis, sed spiritualia et coelestia, quae correspondent; quid alioquin, nisi vanae et mirabiles expressiones forent, quod comederent carnes regum, chiliarchorum, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
fortium, equorum, et sedentium super illis, et quod satiarentur super mensa, equo, curru, forti et omni viro belli; et quod biberent sanguinem principum terrae, et sanguinem usque ad ebrietatem. Quod haec dicta sint de Sancta Coena Domini, clare patet, nam nominatur Coena Magni Dei, et quoque Sacrificium magnum.</p>
<p>
[2] Quoniam omnia spiritualia et coelestia unice se referunt ad bonum et verum, sequitur quod per Carnem intelligatur Bonum charitatis, et per Sanguinem verum fidei, et in supremo sensu Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum amoris et quoad Divinum Verum sapientiae. Bonum spirituale per Carnem etiam intelligitur per haec apud Ezechielem, "Dabo illis Cor unum, et spiritum novum dabo in medio vestri, et removebo Cor lapidis, et dabo illis Cor carnis," <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_19.htm">Ezechiel 11:19</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_36_26.htm">36:26</a>per Cor in Verbo significatur amor, inde per Cor carnis, amor boni. Praeterea, quod per Carnem et Sanguinem, intelligatur bonum et verum, utrumque spirituale, amplius constat ex significatione Panis et Vini in nunc sequentibus, quoniam Dominus dicit, quod Caro Ipsius sit Panis, et quod Sanguis Ipsius sit Vinum, quod e Poculo bibebatur.<p>
