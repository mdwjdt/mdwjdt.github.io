780. For the purpose of being constantly present with me, the Lord has disclosed the spiritual meaning of his Word to me; in that meaning, divine truth stands forth in its own light, and the Lord is forever present in that light. His presence in the Word comes exclusively through its spiritual meaning. Through the light of the spiritual meaning, the Lord passes into the shadows in which the literal meaning stands, much the way the sun's light during the daytime passes through an intervening cloud. (I have shown above [<a href="776.htm">776</a>] that the Word's literal meaning is like a cloud and its spiritual meaning is its glory; and the Lord himself is the sun from which that light comes; therefore the Lord is the Word.)
<p>The glory with which the Lord is going to come (<a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>) means the divine truth in its own light; the Word's spiritual meaning exists in this light. This is clearly shown in the following passages.
<p>The voice of one crying in the desert, "Prepare a way for Jehovah. The glory of Jehovah will be revealed, and all flesh will see it. " (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_5.htm">5</a>)
<p>Shine, because your light has come and the glory of Jehovah has risen upon you. (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a> to the end)
<p>I will give you as a covenant to the people, as a light for the nations. I will not give my glory to another. (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_42_8.htm">8</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_48_11.htm">48:11</a>)
<p>Your light will break forth like the dawn. The glory of Jehovah will gather you in. (<a href="3927/isaiah_58_8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>)
<p>The whole earth will be filled with the glory of Jehovah. (<a href="3927/numbers_14_21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_6_1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-3</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_66_18.htm">66:18</a>)
<p>In the beginning was the Word. In it there was life, and that life was the light for humankind. He was the true light. And the Word became flesh, and we saw his glory, glory like that of the only begotten child of the Father. (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">4</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>)
<p>The heavens will tell the glory of God. (<a href="3927/psalms_19_1.htm">Psalms 19:1</a>)
<p>The glory of God will enlighten the holy Jerusalem. Its lamp is the Lamb. The nations that are being saved will walk in his light. (<a href="3927/revelation_21_23.htm">Revelation 21:23-24</a>)
<p>Not to mention many other passages.
<p>Glory means divine truth in all its fullness, because every magnificent thing that exists in heaven comes from the light that emanates from the Lord, and in its essence that light, which emanates from the Lord as the sun of the spiritual world, is divine truth. </p>

780. In order that the Lord could be constantly present with me, He has revealed to me the spiritual sense of His Word, in which Divine truth is illuminated by its own light, and in this He is continually present. For it is through the spiritual sense and in no other way that He is present in the Word. His presence passes A through the light shed by the spiritual sense into the shadow which covers the literal sense. This may be compared with the sun's light in daytime obscured by an intervening cloud. I proved above that the literal sense of the Word is like a cloud, and its spiritual sense is the glory, and the Lord Himself is the sun which gives light, so that the Lord is the Word. It is clear from the following passages that the glory in which the Lord is to come (<a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>) means Divine truth in its own light, which contains the spiritual sense of the Word:<p>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way for Jehovah. The glory of Jehovah will be revealed, and all flesh will see it, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_5.htm">5</a>.<p>Shine, for your light has come and the glory of Jehovah has risen upon you, <a href="3927/isaiah_60_1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a>-end.<p>I shall make you to be a covenant for the people, a light for the nations; and my glory I shall not give to another, <a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_42_8.htm">8</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_48_11.htm">48:11</a>.<p>Your light will burst forth like the dawn, the glory of Jehovah will gather you up, <a href="3927/isaiah_58_8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>.<p>The whole earth will be filled with the glory of Jehovah, <a href="3927/numbers_14_21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_6_1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-3</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_66_18.htm">66:18</a>.<p>In the beginning was the Word. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. He was the true light. And the Word was made flesh, and we saw His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">4</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>The heavens will tell the glory of God, <a href="3927/psalms_19_1.htm">Psalms 19:1</a>.<p>The Glory of God will give light to the Holy Jerusalem, and the Lamb will be its lantern; and the nations who are saved will walk in its <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
light, <a href="3927/revelation_21_23.htm">Revelation 21:23-24</a>.<p>There are many other similar passages. The reason why glory means Divine truth in its fulness is that everything magnificent in heaven is so because of the light, which is radiated from the Lord. And the light radiating from Him as the sun of heaven is in its essence Divine truth.<p>

780. In order that the Lord might be continuously present with me He has unfolded to me the spiritual sense of His Word, wherein is Divine truth in its very light, and it is in this light that He is continually present. For His presence in the Word is by means of the spiritual sense and in no other way; through the light of this sense He passes into the obscurity of the literal sense, which is like what takes place when the light of the sun in day-time is passing through an interposing cloud. That the sense of the letter of the Word is like a cloud, and the spiritual sense is the glory, the Lord Himself being the sun from which the light comes, and that thus the Lord is the Word, has been shown above. That "the glory" in which He is to come (<a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>), signifies Divine truth in its light, in which light the spiritual sense of the Word is, can be clearly seen from the following passages: <p>The voice of one crying in the desert, prepare ye the way of Jehovah; the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_5.htm">5</a>). <p>Shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a> to the end). <p>I will give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, and My glory will I not give to another (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_42_8.htm">8</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_48_11.htm">48:11</a>). <p>Thy light shall break forth as the morning; the glory of Jehovah shall gather thee up (<a href="3927/isaiah_58_8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a>). <p>All the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah (<a href="3927/numbers_14_21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_6_1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-3</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_66_18.htm">46:18</a>). <p>In the beginning was the Word; in Him was life, and the life was the light of men. That was the true Light.

"Glory" signifies Divine truth its fullness, because all that is magnificent in heaven is from the light that goes forth from the Lord, and the light going forth from Him as the sun there, is in its essence Divine truth. </p>

For the Lord's presence in the Word is only by means of the spiritual sense, through the light of which He passes into the shade in which is the sense of the Letter; and then it is as when the sun's light in day-time passes through an intervening cloud.
