<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第350节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>350</b>.⑴信之真理能无限增多。这一点从以下事实明显可知，即天堂天使的智慧能增长到永恒。而且，天使声称，智慧永无止境，因为智慧的唯一源头是神性真理（简称圣真），圣真藉着从主流入、照射它们的光而被解析排列成形式。人的聪明才智若是真的，就不会有其它源头。圣真能无限增多的原因在于，主是圣真本身，或无限的真理，祂将所有人吸引到自己这里。不过，由于天使和世人是有限的，所以他们只能照自己的度量回应这吸引力，尽管吸引力会朝着无限持续下去。主的圣言就是深不可测的真理之矿，天使一切智慧的源头。然而，在丝毫不知圣言的属灵和属天之义的人眼里，它不过象一壶水而已。信之真理的这种无限增多好比人的精子，其中每一个精子都能代代繁衍家族。信之真理的繁殖方式好比田里或园里种子的繁殖方式；这些种子能繁殖到无数个，并且会永远繁殖下去。圣言中的种子无非是真理，“田地”是指教义，“园子”是指智慧。人的心智就象土壤，属灵和属世的真理象种子那样被植入其中，并且可以无限增多。人从神的无限中获得这种本能，祂携其热与光，以及生产的能力不断存在于人里面。</p>

<p>
350. (1)信之真理可無限增加。
<p>這可從天國中天人們永遠增長的智慧看得出來。實際上, 天人聲稱, 智慧永無盡頭, 並且智慧的唯一來源是神性真理, 這些真理藉著從主而來的光照被分析劃分成各樣的形式。人若真正聰明, 此聰明的來源也沒有別的, 唯有源自於神性真理。
<p>神性真理為何能被無限增長？因為主是神性真理本身, 在無限中的真理, 吸引萬人歸向祂。但是, 因為天人與人是有限的, 儘管這引向無限的吸引之力持續不變地努力著, 除非在限定的範圍內, 他們無法跟隨這吸引之流。
<p>主的話, 是真理的海洋, 浩瀚深奧, 是眾天人一切智慧的源泉。然而, 對於那些不知道聖言屬靈與屬天意義之人而言, 頂多不過是一罐水而已。
<p>真理無限的增長, 好比人的精子, 每一顆都能繁殖成世世代代接續的家庭。真理繁殖的方式也好比田地或園子裡種子的繁殖, 它們能繁殖至數億個, 並無盡頭地持續繁殖。在聖言中, "種子"的含義, 除了真理, 不表示別的, "田地"的意思表示教導, "園子"則表示智慧。
<p>人的頭腦好比土壤, 屬靈的和屬世的真理可以像種子那樣種在裡面, 它們能無盡頭地繁殖。人從上帝的無限獲得這樣的能力, 祂永遠出現在我們裡面, 並賜給我們光與熱, 以及繁殖的能力。 </p>

350. [a] The truths of faith can be multiplied to infinity. This is clear from the wisdom of the angels of heaven, which grows forever. In fact, the angels say that there is never an end to wisdom. Wisdom has no other source except divine truths that have been analytically divided into forms by means of light flowing in from the Lord. Human intelligence that is truly intelligent has the same source.
<p>Divine truth can be multiplied to infinity because the Lord is divine truth itself, or truth in its infinity. He attracts all people toward himself, but because they are finite, angels and people are unable to follow that current of attraction except to a limited extent. The force of attraction toward infinity persists all the same.
<p>The Lord's Word is an ocean of truths, vast and deep, from which all angelic wisdom comes, although to those of us who do not know about its spiritual and heavenly meanings the Word appears to hold no more than a jug of water.
<p>The multiplication of truths to infinity is like human sperm, one of which can lead to whole extended families that exist for tens of thousands of years. The proliferation of the truths of faith is like the proliferation of seeds in fields and gardens - they are capable of generating hundreds of millions of plants and continuing without end. In the Word, "seed" has no other meaning than truth, "field" means a body of teaching, and garden means wisdom.
<p>The human mind is like soil in which both spiritual and earthly truths can be planted like seeds and can multiply without end. We derive this attribute from the infinity of God. He is constantly present in us with his light and warmth and his generative ability. </p>

350. (i) It is evident that the truths of faith are capable of being multiplied to infinity from the wisdom of the angels in heaven being for ever increasing. The angels also say that there is never any limit to wisdom, and the only source of wisdom is from Divine truths analytically arranged by means of the light which falls on them, coming from the Lord. Nor is there any other source of human intelligence, if it is truly intelligence. The reason why Divine truth can be infinitely multiplied is that the Lord is Divine truth itself, that is, truth in an infinite degree, and it attracts all men to itself. But angels and men, being finite, can only respond to the attractive force by their prescribed amounts, though the attractive force constantly strives towards infinity. The Lord's Word is an unfathomable mine of truths, the source of all the wisdom of the angels. Yet in the case of a person who knows nothing about the spiritual and celestial meanings of the Word, this is no more visible than water is when contained in a jar.</p>
<p>
[2] The way the truths of faith multiply to infinity can be compared with human seed, each one of which can propagate families for century after century. The way the truths of faith reproduce can also be compared with the way seeds in fields or gardens reproduce; these can be propagated to make hundreds of millions and for ever. Seed in the Word means simply truth, a field means doctrine, a garden wisdom. The human mind resembles the soil in which spiritual and natural truths are planted like seeds, and they can multiply without limit. People acquire this capacity from the infinity of God, who is perpetually present giving His light and heat, and the capacity to beget. </p>

350. (1) The Truths of Faith may be multiplied to Infinity. This is evident from the fact that the wisdom of the angels of heaven increases to eternity. Moreover, the angels say that there is no end to wisdom, as its source is no other than Divine truths analytically distributed into forms by means of light flowing in from the Lord. Such human intelligence as is truly intelligence is from no other source. Divine truth may be multiplied to infinity, because the Lord is Divine truth itself, or truth in its infinity, and He draws all men to Himself; but as angels and men are finite they can follow the current of the attraction only according to their measure, although the force of the attraction persists to infinity. The Lord's Word is a great deep of truths from which comes all angelic wisdom, although to the man who knows nothing of its spiritual and celestial meanings, it appears like the water in a pitcher. The multiplication of the truths of faith to infinity may be compared to the seed of men, from one of whom may be propagated families to ages of ages. The proliferation of the truths of faith may be compared to the proliferation of seeds in a field or a garden, which may be propagated to myriads of myriads and perpetually. In the Word "seed" means nothing but truth, "field" means doctrine, and "garden" wisdom. The human mind is like soil, in which spiritual and natural truths are implanted like seeds and may be endlessly multiplied. Man derives this from the infinity of God, who is perpetually in man with His heat and light, and the faculty of generating. </p>

350. (1) The truths of faith can be multiplied to infinity. This is evident from the fact that the wisdom of the angels of heaven increases to eternity. Moreover, the angels declare that there is no limit to wisdom, which is derived solely from Divine truths analytically arranged into forms by the influx of light from the Lord. Human intelligence, so far as it is truly intelligence, is from no other source. Divine Truth can be multiplied to infinity, because the Lord is Divine Truth Itself, or Truth in its infinity, and He attracts all to Himself. Angels and men, however, being finite, can follow the current of His attraction only according to their own capacity, while the effort to attract them persists to infinity. The Word of the Lord is a fathomless deep of truths, from which all the wisdom of the angels is derived; although to the man who knows nothing of its spiritual and celestial senses, it seems to be no more than a pitcher of water. The truths of faith in their multiplication to infinity may be compared to the seed of humanity, from one of which families may be propagated to endless generations. This prolification may also be compared to that of the seeds of field and garden, which may be propagated in countless numbers for ever. Moreover, seed in the Word signifies truth, a field doctrine, and a garden wisdom. The human mind is like ground in which spiritual and natural truths are implanted like seeds, and these truths may be multiplied without end. Man derives this power from the infinity of God, who is continually present with His light and heat, and with His generative power. </p>

350. QUOD VERITATES FIDEI SINT MULTIPLICABILES IN INFINITUM, constare potest ex sapientia Angelorum Coeli, quod crescat in aeternum, dicunt etiam Angeli, quod nusquam aliquis finis sapientiae sit, ac sapientia non aliunde est, quam ex Divinis Veris analytice in formas dispestis media luce influente a Domino: intelligentia humana, quae vere intelligentia est, nec aliunde est. Multiplicabilitas Divini Veri in infinitum est ex causa, quia Dominus est ipsum Divinum Verum, seu Verum in sua infinitate, et attrahit omnes ad se, sed venam attractionis non sequi possunt angeli et homines, quia finiti sunt, quam per sua demensa, perstante jugiter attractionis nisu in infinitum, Verbum Domini est abyssus veritatum, ex qua est omnis sapientia angelica, tametsi illud coram homine, qui non scit aliquid de Sensu spirituali et coelesti ejus, non plus apparet quam sicut aqua in hydria. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>

[2] Multiplicatio veritatum fidei in infinitum <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
comparari potest cum seminibus hominum, ex quorum uno propagari possunt familiae in saecula saeculorum. Prolificatio veritatum fidei etiam comparari potest cum prolificatione seminum agri et horti, quae propagari <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
possunt in myriades myriadum, et in perpetuum; per Semen in Verbo nec aliud intelligitur quam Verum, per agrum Doctrina, et per Hortum sapientia. Mens humana est sicut Humus, cui vera spiritualia, et naturalia, sicut semina, implantantur, et multiplicari possunt absque fine; hoc trahit homo ex Infinitate Dei, qui cum sua luce et suo calore, et cum facultate generandi, perpetuo inest.<p>
