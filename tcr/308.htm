<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第308节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>308</b>.必须牢牢记在心里的是：主向所有信奉祂的教会教义之人不断发出一个天堂之爱的神性气场或神性属天气场（Divine－heavenly sphere of love或Divine sphere of heavenly love）。因为这样的人顺从祂，就像世上的小孩子顺从他们的父母，他们专注于祂、愿意接受祂的喂养，也就是指教。<br />对婴儿和小孩子的爱这样一个属世气场，就是由这个属天气场产生的。这个气场是最最普遍的，不仅影响人类，也影响飞禽走兽，甚至影响蛇类。事实上，不仅影响有生气的生物，还影响着无生命的物体。主为了作用于这些事物，如同作用于属灵事物，就造了尘世太阳和大地，这个太阳就像父亲，而大地就像母亲。<br />太阳可以说是共同的父亲、大地是共同的母亲，二者的婚姻所萌生的万物装饰大地的表面。天国的气场作用于尘世，就产生了植物的神奇生长，如从种子到结果，再到新种子的生长过程。这也是为何很多植物白天会面朝太阳，日落后就转离。这也是为何有些花在太阳升起时就张开，在太阳落下时就闭合。也正因如此，鸣叫的鸟儿会在清晨发出甜美的啼鸣，在得到大地母亲的喂养后也是如此。所以，所有这些事物都尊敬它们的父亲和母亲。<br />所有这些现象都是证据，证明主藉着尘世的太阳和大地为一切有生命和无生命之物供应所有必需品。因此，我们在大卫诗篇中读到：<br />你们要从天上赞美耶和华。日头月亮，要赞美祂；所有在地上的，大鱼和一切深洋，要赞美祂。结果的树木和香柏树，野兽和一切牲畜，昆虫和飞鸟，世上的君王和万民，少年人和处女，都当赞美耶和华。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.1.htm">诗篇148:1</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.12.htm">12</a>）<br />在约伯记：<br />你且问走兽，走兽必指教你；又问空中的飞鸟，飞鸟必告诉你；或与地说话，地必指教你；海中的鱼，也必向你说明。看这一切，谁不知道是耶和华的手作成的呢？（<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯12.7.htm">约伯记12:7</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯12.9.htm">9</a>）<br />“问，它们必指教”表示通过这些事物来观察、研究并判断：是主耶和华创造了它们。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #308 </h4>
<p>
308. 要明白一個重要的概念:從主不斷散發的屬天仁愛的神性之場, 會發向信奉祂教會之教導的所有人。這樣的人, 正如世上孩童服從他們父母那般, 服從祂,接近祂,向祂尋求食物——也就是從祂受教。這樣的屬天之場正是世間屬世之場的起因, 特別是對嬰兒的愛。這絕對地普遍存在, 不僅影響人類, 也影響著飛禽走獸, 甚至毒蛇在內。事實上, 不僅影響著有生命之物, 還影響著無生命之物。主為了對無生命之物有如此影響,如同祂對屬靈之物的影響, 祂造了個太陽, 就像父親那樣來對待這個物質世界, 並造了大地, 如同母親那樣對待這個物質世界。太陽如父,大地如母, 二者的結合帶來了一切產物的萌發, 並裝飾這個星球的表面。
<p>屬天之場作用於屬世之場的行為, 導致植物從種子到結果,再成新種子的奇妙旅程成為真實。這也是為何許多植物會轉動, 可以說是轉向太陽, 日落後就轉開。這也是為何鳴禽在清晨鳴叫甜美, 在得到它們大地母親的餵養後也是如此。因此, 一切生物以此方式來敬重它們的父親和它們的母親。
<p>所有這些現象都是證據, 來證明主通過太陽和大地來提供物質世界中一切有生命無生命之物的全部所需。因此, 我們在大衛『詩篇』中讀到:你們要從天上讚美耶和華。日頭月亮, 要讚美祂; 所有在地上的, 大魚和一切深洋, 要讚美祂。結果的樹木和香柏樹, 野獸和一切牲畜, 昆蟲和飛鳥, 世上的君王和萬民, 少年人和處女, 都當讚美耶和華(<a href="3927/psalms_148_1.htm">詩篇148:1-12</a>)。你且問走獸, 走獸必指教你; 又問空中的飛鳥, 飛鳥必告訴你; 或與地說話, 地必指教你; 海中的魚, 也必向你說明。看這一切, 誰不知道是耶和華的手作成的呢？(<a href="3927/job_12_7.htm">約伯記12:7-9</a>)
<p>"問, 它們必指教"表示由這些事物來觀察,注意並判斷:主耶和華造了它們。 </p>

308. An important idea to grasp is that a divine field of heavenly love constantly radiates from the Lord to all people who embrace the teaching of his church. Like little children in the world with their father and mother, these people obey the Lord, stay close to him, and want to be nourished, that is, instructed by him.
<p>From this heavenly field an earthly field arises. It is a field of love for babies and children. It is absolutely universal. It affects not only people but also birds and animals, including even snakes. In fact, it affects not only animate things but also inanimate things. In order for the Lord to have an effect on inanimate things as he does on spiritual things, he created a sun that is like a father to the physical world and an earth that is like a mother to it. The marriage of the sun as a father and the earth as a mother produces all the growth that adorns the surface of the planet.
<p>The influence of this heavenly field on the physical world occasions the miraculous progression in plants from seed to fruit to new seeds. It also results in many types of plant that turn their faces, so to speak, toward the sun by day and bow them when the sun sets, and in flowers that open when the sun rises and close when it sets. It also induces the songbirds to sing sweetly first thing in the morning and again after they have been fed by their mother, the earth. In these ways all these creatures honor their father and their mother.
<p>All these phenomena are proof that through the sun and the earth the Lord makes available all the necessities for both the living beings and the inanimate things in the physical world. Therefore we read in David,
<p>Praise Jehovah from the heavens. Praise him, sun and moon. Praise him from the earth, great sea creatures and the depths. Praise him, fruit trees and all cedars, the wild beast and every animal, creeping things and birds with wings, the kings of the earth and all peoples, young men and young women. ()
<p>Also in Job:
<p>Please, ask the animals and they will teach you. Ask the birds of heaven and they will make it known to you. Ask the shrub of the earth and it will instruct you. The fish in the sea will tell you the story. Which of all these things does not know that the hand of Jehovah has done this? (<a href="3927/job_12_7.htm">Job 12:7-9</a>)
<p>"Ask and they will teach" means watch, pay attention, and judge from these things that the Lord Jehovih created them. </p>

308. It must be grasped that there proceeds constantly from the Lord a Divine sphere of heavenly love towards all who embrace the teaching of His church, and who, just as children in the world obey their father and mother, obey Him, are attached to Him, and seek food, that is, instruction from Him. This heavenly sphere is the origin of the natural sphere of love towards infants and children. This is extremely universal, affecting not only human beings but also birds and beasts, even down to snakes; and not only animate creatures, but even inanimate objects. But the Lord, in order to work on these as He does on spiritual things, created the sun to be a sort of father in the natural world, and the earth to be a sort of mother. For the sun is so to speak the common father, and the earth the common mother, from whose marriage spring all the products of germination which adorn the earth's surface. The action of that heavenly sphere on the natural world produces those wonderful developments of plants from seed to fruit and to new seeds. That too is why there are many kinds of plants which by day turn their faces, so to speak, towards the sun, and turn them away when the sun sets. That too is why there are flowers which open as the sun rises and close as it sets. That too is why song birds sing sweetly in the early morning, and likewise when they have been fed by mother earth. So it is that all these things honour their father and their mother. All of these occurrences are evidence that the Lord, by means of the sun and the earth in the natural world, provides all necessities for living creatures and for inanimate matter. That is why we read in the Psalms of David:<p>Praise Jehovah from the heavens. Praise Him, sun and moon; praise Him from the earth, whales and deeps. Praise Him, fruit tree and all cedars; wild beast and every animal, reptile and birds with wings; the kings of the earth and all peoples, young men and maidens, <a href="3927/psalms_148_1.htm">Psalms 148:1-12</a>.<p>And in Job:<p>Ask, I beg you, the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the sky, and they will report to you; or the plant of the earth, and it will instruct you; and the fish of the sea will tell you. Who does not know from all these things that the hand of Jehovah has done this? <a href="3927/job_12_7.htm">Job 12:7-9</a>.<p>'Ask and they will teach' means look, pay attention and judge from them that the Lord Jehovih <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>

308. It must be kept in mind that a Divine-heavenly sphere of love continually goes forth from the Lord toward all who embrace the doctrine of His church, who are obedient to Him, as children are to their father and mother in the world, who devote themselves to Him, and who wish to be fed, that is, instructed by Him. From this heavenly sphere a natural sphere arises, which is one of love towards infants and children. This is a most universal sphere, affecting not only men, but also birds and beasts and even serpents; nor animate things only, but also things inanimate. But that the Lord might operate upon these even as upon spiritual things, He created a sun to be in the natural world like a father, the earth being like a mother. For the sun is like a common father and the earth like a common mother from the marriage of which all the vegetation that adorns the surface of the earth is produced. From the influx of that heavenly sphere into the natural world, come the marvelous developments of vegetation from seed to fruit, and again to new seed. It is from this also that many kinds of plants turn, as it were, their faces to the sun during the day, and turn them away when the sun sets. It is from this also that there are flowers that open at the rising of the sun and close at his setting. It is from this also that the song-birds sing sweetly at the early dawn, and likewise after they have been fed by their mother earth. Thus do all these honor their father and mother. They all bear testimony that in the natural world the Lord provides through the sun and the earth all necessities both for animate and inanimate things. Therefore it is said in David: <p>Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens; praise ye Him, sun and moon; praise Him from the earth, ye dragons and all deeps; praise Him, fruitful trees and all cedars; beasts and all cattle; creeping things and flying fowl; kings of the earth and all peoples; young men and maidens (<a href="3927/psalms_148_1.htm">Psalms 148:1-12</a>); <p>and in Job: <p>Ask, I pray, the beasts and they shall teach thee; or the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee; or the shrub of the earth, and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. Who doth not know from all these things that the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this? (<a href="3927/job_12_7.htm">Job 12:7-9</a>). <p>"Ask and they will teach," signifies to observe, study, and judge from these things that the Lord Jehovah created them. </p>

308. It should be understood that there continually proceeds from the Lord a Divine celestial sphere of love towards all those who embrace the doctrine of His Church, and who, like children in this world in regard to their father and mother, are obedient and attentive to Him, and desire to be nourished, that is, instructed by Him. From this celestial sphere there arises a natural sphere of love for infants and children. This is a universal sphere, affecting not only men, but also birds and beasts, and even creeping things; and not only animate, but also inanimate things. In order that the Lord might operate upon these things of nature, as He does upon spiritual things, He created the sun to be in the natural world as a father, and the earth, as a mother. For the sun is like a common father, and the earth as a common mother, from whose marriage springs all the vegetation that adorns the face of the earth. The influx of that celestial sphere into the natural world is the cause of those wonderful stages in vegetation from the seed to the fruit and to new seeds. This is the reason why many plants turn to the sun by day, and turn away when he sets; and why some flowers open when the sun rises, and close when he sets. Hence also song-birds sing sweetly at early dawn, and also after being fed by their mother earth. Thus do these honor their father and their mother. All this is evidence that the Lord, by means of the sun and the earth in the natural world, provides all things necessary for animate and inanimate creation. It is therefore said in David,<p>"Praise ye JEHOVAH from the heavens... Praise ye Him, sun and moon... Praise Him from the earth, ye dragons and all deeps... fruitful trees and all cedars: Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl: Kings of the earth, and all people... Both young men and maidens" <a href="3927/psalms_148_1.htm">Psalms 148:1-12</a>;<p>and in Job: "But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: or the shrub of the earth (A.V., Or speak to the earth), and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of JEHOVAH hath wrought this" <a href="3927/job_12_7.htm">12:7-9</a>.<p>"Ask and they shall teach" signifies observe, study, and judge from these things that the Lord Jehovih created them. </p>

Tenendum est, quod a Domino continue procedat Sphaera Divina coelestis amoris erga omnes, qui Ecclesiae Ipsius doctrinam amplectuntur, et qui sicut infantes in Mundo patri et matri, obediunt Ipsi, se applicant Ipsi, et volunt nutriri, hoc est, instrui ab Ipso: ex hac coelesti Sphaera oritur Naturalis Sphaera, quae est amoris erga infantes et liberos, quae universalissima est, et non modo afficit homines, sed etiam aves et bestias, usque ad serpentes; nec solum animata, sed etiam inanimata, sed ut Dominus in haec, sic ut in spiritualia operetur, creavit Solem, qui in Naturali Mundo esset sicut Pater, ac Terra sicut Mater; est enim Sol sicut communis Pater, et Terra sicut communis Mater, ex quorum conjugio existunt omnes germinationes, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
quae Telluris superficiem exornant: ex influxu coelestis illius Sphaerae in naturalem Mundum existunt mirabiles illae progressiones vegetationum a semine ad fructus et ad nova semina: inde quoque est, quod sint plura Virgultorum genera, quae interdiu vertunt sicut facies suas ad Solem, et avertunt illas cum Sol occidit: inde quoque est, quod sint Flores qui oriente Sole se aperiunt, et occidente se occludunt: inde quoque est, quod oscines in prima matuta dulciter canant, et similiter postquam a Terra matre sua nutriti sunt; ita haec et illa honorant patrem suum et matrem suam; haec omnia sunt testimonia, quod Dominus per Solem et Terram in Mundo naturali prospiciat vivis et non vivis omnes necessitates; quare dicitur apud Davidem, Laudate Jehovam e Coelis, laudate Ipsum Sol et Luna; laudate Ipsum e terra, balaenae et abyssi; laudate Ipsum arbor fructus, omnes cedri; fera et omnis bestia, reptile, et avis alae; Reges terrae, et omnes populi, juvenes et virgines, <a href="3927/psalms_148_1.htm">Psalm 148:1-12</a>, <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
