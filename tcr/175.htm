<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>175</b>.使徒教会对永恒的位格或三位格的三一一无所知，这一点从使徒教会的教义，即所谓的《使徒信经》明显看出来。该信经包含这些话：<br />我信神，全能的父，天地的创造者。我信耶稣基督，祂的独生子，我们的主；祂因着圣灵成孕，从童女马利亚所生；我信圣灵。<br />这里没有提到什么永恒的子，只说因着圣灵成孕、从童女马利亚所生的子。因为他们从使徒知道，耶稣基督是真神（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约壹5.20.htm">约翰一书5:20</a>）；神本性一切的丰盛，都有形有体地居住在基督里面（<a href="http://39-27.cn/西2.9.htm">歌罗西书2:9</a>）；使徒传讲要信祂（<a href="http://39-27.cn/徒20.21.htm">使徒行传20:21</a>）；祂拥有天上地下所有的权柄（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">马太福音28:18</a>）。</p>

175. 使徒教會不知道任何三位一體或從永遠就有的三個神性位格, 可從被稱為『使徒信經』的信仰中明顯看到, 其中的文字包括:"我信上帝, 全能的父, 天地的創造者。我信耶穌基督, 祂的獨生子, 我們的主, 由聖靈受孕,童貞女瑪利亞所生。我信聖靈。"
<p>這裡沒有提到什麼子從永遠生出, 只有子由聖靈受孕,童貞女瑪利亞所生的子。因為從使徒們的書信中, 他們知道耶穌基督是真上帝(<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">約翰一書5:20</a>); 神性一切的豐富有形有體地住在基督裡(<a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">歌羅西書2:9</a>); 使徒們傳揚要信祂(<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_20_21.htm">使徒行傳20:21</a>); 祂有天地一切的權柄(<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">馬太福音28:18</a>)。 </p>

175. It is very obvious from the creed of what is known as the apostolic church that it had no awareness at all of any trinity of persons or of three persons from eternity. There the following words occur: "I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth. I believe in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord, who was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. And I believe in the Holy Spirit. "
<p>There is no mention here of any "Son from eternity. " The Son mentioned here was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. From the writings of the apostles the people of that church knew that Jesus Christ was the true God (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>); that all the fullness of divinity dwelt physically in him (<a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>); that the apostles preached faith in him (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_20_21.htm">Acts of the Apostles 20:21</a>); and that all power in heaven and on earth had been given to him (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). </p>

175. The Apostolic church knew nothing about a Trinity of persons or three persons from eternity, as is perfectly plain from the Creed of that church which is known as the Apostles' Creed. This contains the words:<p>I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary; and in the Holy Spirit.<p>There is no mention there of any Son from eternity, but of a Son conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. For they knew from the Apostles that Jesus Christ was the true God (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>); and in Him all the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily (<a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>); and the Apostles preached belief in Him (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_20_21.htm">Acts of the Apostles 20:21</a>); and He had all power in heaven and on earth (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). </p>

175. That the Apostolic church had not the least knowledge of a trinity of persons, or of three persons from eternity, can be clearly seen from the creed of that church which is called the Apostles' Creed, in which are these words - "I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary;" and "I believe in the Holy Ghost." Here no mention is made of a Son born from eternity, but only of a Son conceived by the Holy Spirit, and born of the virgin Mary; for they knew from the apostles: <p>That Jesus Christ was the true God (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>) <p>And that in Him dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily (<a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>); <p>And that the apostles preached faith in Him (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_20_21.htm">Acts of the Apostles 20:21</a>); <p>And that to Him was given all power in heaven and on earth (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). </p>

175. The Apostolic Church knew nothing of a trinity of Persons, or of three Persons from eternity, as is evident from the creed of that Church, called the Apostles' Creed, where it is said:<p>"I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only Son our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; and in the Holy Ghost."<p>Here no mention is made of any Son from eternity, but of a Son conceived by the Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin Mary; for those who framed that creed knew from the Apostles:<p> Jesus Christ was the true God, <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>;<p>that in Him dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, <a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>;<p>that the Apostles preached faith in Him, <a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_20_21.htm">Acts 20:21</a>; and that He had all power in heaven and in earth, <a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>. </p>

175. Quod Ecclesia Apostolica ne hilum sciverit de Trinitate Personarum, seu de tribus Personis ab aeterno, constat manifeste a SYMBOLO istius Ecclesiae, quod vocatur APOSTOLICUM, ubi haec sunt, Credo in Deum, Patrem Omnipotentem, Creatorem Coeli et Terrae: et in Jesum Christum, Filium Ejus unicum, Dominum nostrum; qui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto, natus a Maria Virgine: et in Spiritum sanctum: ibi nulla mentio fit alicujus Filii ab aeterno, sed Filii concepti a Spiritu Sancto, et nati a Maria Virgine; scientes ex Apostolis, quod Jesus Christus esset verus Deus, <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 Johannes 5:20</a>; <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
