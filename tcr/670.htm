670. The Washing Called Baptism Means a Spiritual Washing, Which Is the Process of Being Purified from Evils and Falsities and Therefore the Process of Being Regenerated
<p>As we know from the statutes given through Moses, the children of Israel were commanded to wash. For example, Aaron had to wash before putting on his ministerial clothes (<a href="3927/leviticus_16_4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_16_24.htm">24</a>), and also before performing rituals at the altar (<a href="3927/exodus_30_18.htm">Exodus 30:18-21</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_40_30.htm">40:30-32</a>). The Levites were commanded to do the same (<a href="3927/numbers_8_6.htm">Numbers 8:6-7</a>), and so were people whose sins had made them unclean. They were said to be sanctified by washing (<a href="3927/exodus_29_1.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_29_4.htm">4</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_40_12.htm">40:12</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_8_6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>). Therefore to give people a place to wash, there was a "sea" made of bronze and many washbasins placed around the Temple (<a href="3927/1-kings_7_23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-39</a>). People were also told to wash their vessels, furniture, and household items such as tables, saddles, beds, plates, and cups (<a href="3927/leviticus_11_32.htm">Leviticus 11:32</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_14_8.htm">14:8-9</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_15_5.htm">15:5-12</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_17_15.htm">17:15-16</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] The washings just mentioned, and many other things like them, were commanded to and required of the children of Israel because the church that was established among them was symbolic in nature. It was designed to prefigure the Christian church that was yet to come. Therefore when the Lord came into the world, he abolished these symbolic acts, all of which were external in nature, and established a church with practices that were all internal in nature. The Lord dispelled the allegories and revealed the true forms themselves, like someone who opens a veil or a door and allows what is behind it not only to be seen but also to be entered into.
<p>Of all the rituals that had existed earlier the Lord carried over just two, although together they contain everything of the internal church. Baptism took the place of the washings, and the Holy Supper took the place of the lamb that was sacrificed every day and the lambs that were killed for the celebration of the Passover [<a href="3927/exodus_12_3.htm">Exodus 12:3-6</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_29_38.htm">29:38-41</a>; ]. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #670 (Chadwick, 1988)

<p>
670. II. The washing called baptism means spiritual washing, which is purification from evils and falsities, and so regeneration.<p>Acts of washing were enjoined upon the Children of Israel, as is well known from the statutes laid down by Moses. For instance, that Aaron should wash himself before putting on his garments as minister (<a href="3927/leviticus_16_4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_16_24.htm">24</a>); and before approaching the altar to minister (<a href="3927/exodus_30_18.htm">Exodus 30:18-21</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_40_30.htm">40:30-32</a>). The same was enjoined upon the Levites (<a href="3927/numbers_8_6.htm">Numbers 8:6-7</a>); and also others who had become unclean through sins, and they were said to be sanctified by acts of washing (<a href="3927/exodus_29_1.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_29_4.htm">4</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_40_12.htm">40:12</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_8_6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>). Therefore the bronze sea and many basins were placed near the temple, so that they could wash themselves (<a href="3927/1-kings_7_23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-39</a>). They were instructed to wash the vessels and utensils, such as tables, benches, beds, plates and cups (<a href="3927/leviticus_11_32.htm">Leviticus 11:32</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_14_8.htm">14:8-9</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_15_5.htm">15:5-12</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_17_15.htm">17:15-16</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>).</p>
<p>
[2] But the reason why washing and similar acts were ordered and enjoined upon the Children of Israel was that the church established among them was a representative one, and had the character it did so as to prefigure the Christian church which was to come. When therefore the Lord came into the world, He abolished representative acts, all of which were external, and established a church which was in all respects internal. So the Lord banished the symbols and revealed the actual forms, as when someone lifts a curtain or opens a door, allowing what is inside not only to be seen but also approached. Out of all the previous representative acts the Lord retained only two, to contain everything the internal church has in a single pair; these are baptism to replace the acts of washing and the Holy Supper to replace the lamb which was sacrificed every day, and in full measure on the feast of the Passover. </p>

670. II. THE WASHING THAT IS CALLED BAPTISM MEANS SPIRITUAL WASHING, WHICH IS PURIFICATION FROM EVILS AND FALSITIES, AND THUS REGENERATION. <p>That washings were commanded the children of Israel is known from the statutes enacted by Moses, <p>That Aaron should wash himself before putting on the robes of his ministry (<a href="3927/leviticus_16_4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_16_24.htm">24</a>); <p>And before coming near to the altar to minister (<a href="3927/exodus_30_18.htm">Exodus 30:18-21</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_40_30.htm">40:30-32</a>); <p>Also the Levites (<a href="3927/numbers_8_6.htm">Numbers 8:6, 7</a>) <p>And likewise others who had become unclean through sins; and are said to be sanctified by washings (<a href="3927/exodus_29_1.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>, 4; (<a href="3927/exodus_29_4.htm">Exodus 29:4</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_40_12.htm">40:12</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_8_6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>). <p>Therefore in order that they might wash themselves, the molten sea, and many baths were placed near the temple (<a href="3927/1-kings_7_23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-39</a>); <p>They even washed vessels and utensils, such as tables, seats, beds, plates, and cups (<a href="3927/leviticus_11_32.htm">Leviticus 11:32</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_14_8.htm">14:8-9</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_15_5.htm">15:5-12</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_17_15.htm">17:15, 16</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>). <p>But washings and many like things were enjoined upon and commanded the children of Israel, because the church instituted among them was a representative church, and this was such as to prefigure the Christian church that was to come. Therefore when the Lord came into the world, He annuled representatives, which were all external, and instituted a church all things of which were to be internal; thus the Lord banished figures, and revealed the veritable forms, as one withdraws a veil or opens a door and causes interiors not only to be seen, but also to be approached. Of all these representatives the Lord retained but two, which should include in one complex all things pertaining to the internal church. These two are baptism in the place of washings, and the holy supper in the place of the lamb which was sacrificed each day, and in greater fullness at the feast of the passover. </p>

Thus the Lord set aside figures and revealed the very forms, as one removes a veil or opens a door and causes the things within not only to be seen, but also to be approached. Of all those representatives the Lord retained but two, which should include in comprehensive form all things pertaining to the interior Church. These two are Baptism in place of washings, and the Holy Supper in place of the lamb which was sacrificed every day, and with full ritual at the feast of the Passover. </p>
