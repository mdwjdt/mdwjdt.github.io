<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第12节  在现今世上所拥有的圣言时代之前，还有另一本现已遗失的圣言</h4><br />264.摩西五经所记载的事能证实，在圣言时代之前，祭祀敬拜是众所周知的事，并且在圣言通过摩西和众先知被赐给以色列民族之前，人们通过耶和华的口说预言。从以下经文明显可知，祭祀敬拜是众所周知的事：<br />以色列人被命令去拆毁外邦人的祭坛，打碎他们的柱像，砍下他们的木偶。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.13.htm">出埃及记34:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.5.htm">申命记7:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.3.htm">12:3</a>）<br />住在什亭的以色列人开始与摩押的女子行淫；他们叫百姓来，一同给她们的神献祭，百姓就吃她们的祭物。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.1.htm">民数记25:1</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.3.htm">3</a>）<br />来自叙利亚的巴兰筑坛献牛羊。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.40.htm">民数记22:40</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.1.htm">23:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.29.htm">29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.30.htm">30</a>）<br />他还预言主，说：<br />有星要出于雅各，有杖要兴于以色列。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.17.htm">民数记24:17</a>）<br />巴兰还通过耶和华的口说预言。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.13.htm">民数记22:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.3.htm">23:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.26.htm">26</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.1.htm">24:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.13.htm">13</a>）<br />从这些经文明显可知，外邦人也有神性敬拜，几乎和通过摩西为以色列民所设的敬拜一样。摩西五经中的一些话清楚表明，神性敬拜甚至在亚伯拉罕时代之前就已存在（<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.7.htm">申命记32:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.8.htm">8</a>）。从撒冷王麦基洗德的情况看得更清楚：<br />他带着饼和酒，为亚伯兰祝福；亚伯兰就把所得的拿出十分之一给他。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创14.18.htm">创世记14:18</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/创14.20.htm">20</a>）<br />麦基洗德代表主，因为他被称为至高神的祭司（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创14.18.htm">创世记14:18</a>）。在诗篇，经上论到主说：<br />你是照着麦基洗德的等次永远为祭司。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗110.4.htm">诗篇110:4</a>）<br />正因如此，麦基洗德带着饼和酒，因为它们是教会最为神圣的事物，正如它们是圣餐中的圣物。除此之外，还有其它许多现存迹象表明，在以色列圣言之前就有一部圣言，该圣言是这类启示的源头。</p>

<p>
264. 在此聖言之前有另一本已遺失的聖言
<p>在賜給以色列民族的聖言(通過摩西和眾先知)之前, 人們就知道以獻祭來敬拜, 也曉得有從耶和華之口發出的神言。
<p>從下列經文可看出人們知道以獻祭敬拜:以色列百姓被命令去拆毀外邦人的祭壇, 打碎他們的偶像, 砍下他們的木偶(<a href="3927/exodus_34_13.htm">出埃及記34:13</a>;<a href="3927/deuteronomy_7_5.htm">申命記7:5</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_3.htm">12:3</a>)。以色列人在什亭, 與摩押的眾女行淫; 他們邀請以色列百姓一同給她們的神獻祭, 百姓就吃她們的祭物(<a href="3927/numbers_25_1.htm">民數記25:1-3</a>)。來自敘利亞的巴蘭建壇, 並以牛羊獻祭(<a href="3927/numbers_22_40.htm">民數記22:40</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_23_1.htm">23:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_29.htm">29-30</a>)。他還發預言說到主:"有星要出於雅各, 有杖要興於以色列"(<a href="3927/numbers_24_17.htm">民數記24:17</a>)。 巴蘭還以預言來說耶和華的話(<a href="3927/numbers_22_13.htm">民數記22:13</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_22_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_23_3.htm">23:3</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_16.htm">16</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_26.htm">26</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_24_1.htm">24:1</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_24_13.htm">13</a>)。
<p>從以上這些內容, 可清楚看出:在其它民族中有著與以色列民族(通過摩西建立的)事實上相同的敬拜。從摩西五經中的一些話清楚表明, 甚至在亞伯拉罕時期以前就已存在(<a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_7.htm">申命記32:7-8</a>)。從撒冷王麥基洗德之事可更明顯看出:他帶著餅和酒, 並祝福亞伯蘭; 亞伯蘭把所得的拿出十分之一給他(<a href="3927/genesis_14_18.htm">創世記14:18-20</a>)。麥基洗德代表主, 因為他被稱為上帝至高者的祭司(<a href="3927/genesis_14_18.htm">創世記14:18</a>)。在大衛的『詩篇』中表示主:你是照著麥基洗德的等次, 永遠為祭司(<a href="3927/psalms_110_4.htm">詩篇110:4</a>)。
<p>這就是為何麥基洗德帶著作為教會至聖物品餅和酒, 正如它們也是聖餐中的神聖之物。不算其它, 憑這些就足以證明在以色列聖言之前就已有聖言給了如此啟示。 </p>

264. 12. Before the Word That Exists in the World Today, There Was a Word That Has Been Lost
<p>Before the Word existed that was given through Moses and the prophets among the Israelite nation, people knew a form of worship through sacrifices, and their prophets spoke the word of Jehovah. This is clear from things mentioned in the books of Moses.
<p>The following is evidence that people knew a form of worship through sacrifices: The children of Israel were commanded to overturn the altars of other nations, shatter their statues, and cut down their groves (<a href="3927/exodus_34_13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_7_5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_3.htm">12:3</a>). "At Acacia, Israel began to commit harlotry with the daughters of Moab; they invited the people to sacrifices for their gods, and the people ate" (<a href="3927/numbers_25_1.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>). Balaam, who was from Syria, built altars and sacrificed oxen and sheep (<a href="3927/numbers_22_40.htm">Numbers 22:40</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_23_1.htm">23:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_29.htm">29-30</a>). Balaam also gave a prophecy about the Lord saying, "A star will rise out of Jacob and a scepter out of Israel" (<a href="3927/numbers_24_17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>); and Balaam spoke the word of Jehovah in prophecy (<a href="3927/numbers_22_13.htm">Numbers 22:13</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_22_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_23_3.htm">23:3</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_16.htm">16</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_26.htm">26</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_24_1.htm">24:1</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_24_13.htm">13</a>).
<p>The passages just given make it clear that a divine worship existed among other nations that was virtually the same as the worship instituted by Moses among the Israelite nation. From words in Moses (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7-8</a>) it appears that this worship existed even before the time of Abraham. This is still clearer from Melchizedek, king of Salem, who brought out bread and wine and blessed Abram, and Abram in turn gave Melchizedek tithes of all he possessed (<a href="3927/genesis_14_18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>). Melchizedek represented the Lord - he is called a priest to God the Highest (<a href="3927/genesis_14_18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>). In David it says of the Lord, "You are a priest forever on the order of Melchizedek" (<a href="3927/psalms_110_4.htm">Psalms 110:4</a>). This is why Melchizedek brought out bread and wine as the holiest things in the church, just as bread and wine are holy in the Holy Supper also. Besides many others, these things are outstanding indications that before the Israelite Word there was a Word that gave these revelations. </p>

264. XII. Before the time of the Word which we have in the world to-day, there was another Word, now lost.<p>It can be established from what is recorded in the books of Moses, that before the time of the Word, which was given to the Israelite nation by means of Moses and the Prophets, worship by sacrifices was well known, and that prophecies were given from the mouth of Jehovah. The following passages show that worship by sacrifices was known. It was commanded that the Children of Israel should overturn the altars of the gentiles, break in pieces their statues, and cut down their sacred groves (<a href="3927/exodus_34_13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_7_5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_3.htm">12:3</a>.) Israel in Shittim began to wanton with the daughters of Moab; they invited the people to the sacrifices offered to their gods, and the people ate of them (<a href="3927/numbers_25_1.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>). Balaam, who came from Syria, had altars built and sacrificed cattle and sheep (<a href="3927/numbers_22_40.htm">Numbers 22:40</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_23_1.htm">23:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_29.htm">29-30</a>). He also prophesied about the Lord, saying that a star should arise from Jacob and a sceptre from Israel (<a href="3927/numbers_24_17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>). And he gave prophecies from the mouth of Jehovah (<a href="3927/numbers_22_13.htm">Numbers 22:13</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_22_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_23_3.htm">23:3</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_16.htm">16</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_23_26.htm">26</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_24_1.htm">24:1</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_24_13.htm">13</a>). It is plain from these passages that the gentiles had Divine worship almost exactly like that established for the Israelite nation through Moses. Some words in the books of Moses show clearly that it existed even before the time of Abraham (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7-8</a>); but it is even more obvious from the case of Melchizedek, king of Salem:<p>He brought out bread and wine, and blessed Abram; and Abram gave him tithes of everything, <a href="3927/genesis_14_18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>.<p>Melchizedeck represented the Lord, for he is called the priest of God Most High (<a href="3927/genesis_14_18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>); and it is said of the Lord in the Psalms of David:<p>You are priest for ever, after the fashion of Melchizedek, <a href="3927/psalms_110_4.htm">Psalms 110:4</a>.<p>That was why Melchizedek brought out bread and wine, as being the most holy things of the church, just as they are the holy things in the Holy Supper. Apart from these there are extant many indications that there was a Word before the Israelite Word, which was the source of such revelations. </p>

These and many other things are clear proofs that before the Israelitish Word there was a Word from which such revelations as these were derived. </p>
