594. 以西结书这样描述人的重生:<p>我必给你们加上筋, 使你们长肉, 又将皮遮蔽你们, 使气息进入你们里面, 你们就又活了。 (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_1.htm">以西结书37:1-14</a>) <p>这些事象征重生, 这一点通过主的这些话明显可知:<p>这些骸骨就是以色列全家。 (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_11.htm">以西结37:11</a>) <p>还用坟墓作比喻, 因为经上记着:<p>主耶和华必开他们的坟墓, 使骸骨从坟墓中出来, 将灵放在他们里面, 领他们到以色列地。 (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_12.htm">以西结37:12-14</a>) <p>“以色列地”在此处及别处都表教会。 骸骨与坟墓表重生, 因为未重生者被称为死的, 重生者被称为活的, 后者有属灵的生命, 而前者则是属灵的死亡。 </p>

594. Our regeneration is portrayed in Ezekiel as the dry bones on which sinews were placed; then flesh, and skin, and spirit was breathed into them, and they came to life (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1-14</a>). The following words in that story make it obvious that it represents regeneration: "These bones are the whole house of Israel" (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_11.htm">Ezekiel 37:11</a>). There is also a comparison there involving graves. We read that God will open graves and cause bones to rise up out of them, and he will put spirit in them and place them in the land of Israel (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_12.htm">Ezekiel 37:12-14</a>). The land of Israel here and elsewhere means the church. Bones and graves were used to represent regeneration because people who have not been regenerated are called the dead, and people who have been regenerated are called the living. The former are spiritually dead, but the latter are spiritually alive. </p>

594. A person's regeneration is described in Ezekiel by 'dry bones', on which sinews were fastened and then flesh and skin, and finally breath was breathed into them to bring them to life again (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1-14</a>). It is plain that this is a representation of regeneration from it being said there:<p>These bones are the whole house of Israel (verse 11).<p>There is also a comparison there with graves, for it says that He would open the graves and cause the bones to rise from them, and put spirit in them, and settle them upon the land of Israel (verses 12-14). The land of Israel there and elsewhere means the church. The representation of regeneration was effected by means of bones and graves, because the person who has not been regenerated is called dead, and one who has is called alive. The one contains spiritual life, the other spiritual death. </p>

594. Man's regeneration is described in Ezekiel by the "dry bones" which were clothed with sinews, then with flesh and skin, and at last had spirit breathed into them, whereby they lived again (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_1.htm">37:1-14</a>). That regeneration was represented by those things, is evident from what is there said: <p>These bones are the whole house of Israel (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_11.htm">Ezekiel 37:11</a>). <p>A comparison is also there made with graves, for it is written, <p>That Jehovah would open their graves, and cause the bones to come up out of their graves, and put spirit in them, and bring them together into the land of Israel (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_12.htm">Ezekiel 37:12-14</a>). <p>"The land of Israel" there and elsewhere means the church. Regeneration was here represented by bones and graves, because the unregenerate man is called dead, and the regenerate alive; for in the latter there is spiritual life, but in the former spiritual death. </p>

594. Man's regeneration is described in Ezekiel by the dry bones being first clothed with sinews, then with flesh and skin, and finally having spirit breathed into them, so that they revived, Chap <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1-14</a>. That regeneration was represented by these things is evident from the words,<p>"These bones are the whole house of Israel," verse 11.<p>A comparison is also made in the same chapter with sepulchres, for it is written,<p>That He would open their graves, and cause them to come up out of their graves, and bring them into the land of Israel, verses 12-14.<p>The land of Israel, here and elsewhere, means the Church. Regeneration was represented by means of bones and graves because the unregenerate man is called dead, and the regenerate alive; for spiritual life is in the latter, but in the former, spiritual death. </p>

594. Regeneratio hominis describitur apud Ezechielem per Ossa arida, super quae inducebantur nervi, postea caro, et cutes, et demum inspiratus est spiritus, per quae revixerunt, <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_1.htm">37:1-14</a>, quod per illa repraesentata sit Regeneratio, patet clare ab his ibi, Ossa haec sunt tota domus Israelis, Vers. <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_11.htm">11</a>. Comparatur etiam ibi cum sepulchris, nam legitur, quod aperturus sit sepulchra, et ascendere facturus ossa inde, et daturus spiritum in illis, et collocaturus illos super terra Israelis, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Vers. <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_12.htm">12-14</a>; per terram Israelis intelligitur ibi et alibi Ecclesia. Quod repraesentatio regenerationis facta sit per ossa et sepulchra, est quia homo non regeneratus vocatur mortuus, et regeneratus vivus, in hoc enim est vita spiritualis, in illo autem mors spiritualis.<p>
