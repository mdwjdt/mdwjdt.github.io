<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第283节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">十诫曾是以色列教会的至圣之物</h4><br />283.十诫是圣言、因而是要建在以色列民族中的教会的第一个果实，是整个宗教信仰的概要性总结，由此产生神与人，并人与神的联结。因此，十诫如此神圣，以致再没有比它们更神圣的了。从以下事实明显可知，十诫是最神圣的：耶和华自己，就是主，在众天使的陪伴下于火中降临西乃山，从那里大声宣告这些律法。百姓三天预备好自己去观看和聆听，并在山的四围定了界限，免得有人靠近而死，连祭司和长老都不许接近，只有摩西可以。神用手指将这些诫命写在两块石版上。当摩西第二次带着这两块石版下山时，他的面皮发光。后来这些石版被放在约柜中，约柜被安置在会幕的核心处，上面设有施恩座，施恩座上有金子打造的基路伯。会幕的这个核心，也就是约柜所在之处，被称为至圣所。幔子里边是约柜，外边置放了各种物体以代表天堂和教会的神圣事物，即：包金的桌子，桌子上摆有陈设饼，金香坛，有七个灯盏的金灯台，还有四围用捻的细麻和紫色、朱红色线所织的幔子。整个会幕的神圣完全是由于约柜中的律法，并无其它来源。<br />正是由于会幕因着约柜中的律法而具有的神圣，整个以色列民按吩咐照着各支派依次在会幕周围安营，并在它后面依次行进，那时，会幕上面日间有云柱，夜间有火柱。正是由于那律法的神圣和其中耶和华的临在，耶和华才在基路伯之间的施恩座上与摩西说话，约柜被称为“耶和华在那里”。亚伦若非献祭和烧香，不得入内，否则必死。也正是由于耶和华临在于律法之内和周围，奇迹才会通过含有律法的约柜而发生。如，约旦河的水被分开，只要约柜停在河中央，百姓就从干地过河；抬着约柜围绕耶利哥城，城墙就倒塌；大衮，就是非利士人的神，先是在约柜前仆倒，脸伏于地，后来他的头和两手在门槛上折断。伯示麦人因约柜的缘故，有数万人被击杀；乌撒因擅自触摸约柜而被杀。大卫献祭欢天喜地迎接约柜进锡安，后来所罗门迎接约柜进耶路撒冷的圣殿，并为约柜建了内殿，等等。由此清楚可知，十诫曾是以色列教会的至圣之物。</p>

283. 十誡是聖言最重要之物, 因而是建在以色列民族中的教會最重要之事物, 是全部宗教信仰之概括總結, 成為上帝與人,人與上帝聯結的紐帶。因此, 十誡是至神聖之物, 無其它能及。
<p>以下觀點能說明十誡是至聖之物:耶和華主自己, 與眾天人一道, 在火中降臨西乃山, 並口授十誡。此山四圍設障, 任何接近之人必死。甚至連祭司與長老都不許接近, 只許摩西。耶和華親自用手指將這些誡命寫在兩塊石版之上。當摩西第二次攜帶石版下山時, 他臉上放光。
<p>後來, 石版被存放在約櫃內, 約櫃又被尊為整個會幕的中心。約櫃之上還設有施恩座, 施恩座兩頭還有金子打的基路伯。會幕的中心,也就是約櫃安放之地, 被稱為"至聖所"。幔子之外(幔子之內為約櫃擺放之地)置放了一些代表天國與教會的神聖之物。這些物體包括:一張用金子包的桌子, 上面擺陳設餅; 一個燒香用的金祭壇; 有七盞燈的金燈檯; 還有圍繞會幕的幔子, 就是用撚的細麻和藍色紫色朱紅色線織成的幔子。整個會幕的神聖沒有其它來源,全都來自約櫃之中的律法。
<p>正因為會幕一切的神聖都來自於約櫃之中的律法, 因此全以色列會眾圍繞著會幕安營, 一個支派接一個支派, 按著命定有序排列。當他們起行時, 各支派按著選定的次序跟在約櫃之後, 日間去柱, 夜間火柱, 指引前路。
<p>因為約櫃之中律法的神聖, 耶和華臨格其中, 也就是耶和華在施恩座上二基路伯之間與摩西說話, 並且此約櫃曾被稱為"耶和華"。亞倫在獻祭和燒香之外, 不得入內, 入則死。
<p>正因耶和華臨格於此律法其中和其周圍, 內含律法的約櫃就因此行出奇跡之事。例如, 當約櫃停在約旦河中, 河水分開, 人們行幹地過河。當抬著約櫃繞耶利哥城, 城牆倒塌。非利士人的神明大袞, 先是在約櫃之前僕倒, 後來被發現其頭手斷裂在廟宇門檻之上。因為約櫃, 伯示麥數千居民被擊殺。烏撒因擅自觸摸約櫃而死。大衛獻祭歡天喜地迎接約櫃進錫安。之後, 所羅門迎接約櫃進耶路撒冷聖殿, 為約櫃預備了內殿; 等等。這些事情都清楚表明十誡是以色列教會至聖之物。 </p>

283. The Ten Commandments Were the Holiest Thing
<p>in the Israelite Church
<p>The Ten Commandments are the most important thing in the Word. As a result, they were the most important thing in the church that was established in the Israelite nation. In a brief encapsulation they included all the elements of religion that provide for God's connection to us and our connection to God. Therefore the Ten Commandments were the holiest thing of all.
<p>The following points show that the Ten Commandments were the holiest thing: Jehovah the Lord himself, together with angels, came down on Mount Sinai in fire and delivered the Ten Commandments by direct speech. The mountain was fenced all around so that no one would approach and die. Not even the priests or the elders were allowed to approach; only Moses. The commandments were written on two tablets of stone by the finger of God. When Moses carried the tablets down for the second time, his face was glowing.
<p>Afterward, the tablets were stored in an ark that was at the heart of the tabernacle. There was a mercy seat on top of the ark with angel guardians made of gold over it. The inmost area in the tabernacle, where the ark was placed, was called the most holy place. Outside the veil behind which the ark stood there were several things that represented holy things in heaven and the church: a table overlaid with gold that had the showbread on it, a golden altar for burning incense, and a golden lampstand with seven lamps. There was also a curtain around the tabernacle made out of [threads of] fine linen and of purple and scarlet [yarn]. The holiness of the whole tabernacle came from no other source than the law that was inside the ark.
<p>Because of the holiness of the tabernacle that came from the law in the ark, the entire Israelite population camped around the tabernacle, tribe by tribe, in an arrangement that was given by command. When they traveled, the tribes moved in a specific sequence behind the ark, and there was a cloud over the ark by day and a fire by night.
<p>Because of the holiness of this law and Jehovah's presence in it, Jehovah spoke to Moses from over the mercy seat between the angel guardians. In fact, the ark was called "Jehovah" there. Aaron was not allowed inside the veil unless he offered sacrifices and burned incense, or else he would die.
<p>Because of Jehovah's presence in this law and surrounding it, the ark containing the law performed miracles. For example, the waters of the Jordan were split apart, and as long as the ark was resting in the middle of the riverbed the people crossed on dry land. When the ark was carried around the walls of Jericho, the walls fell. Dagon, an idol of the Philistines, at first fell face down before the ark. Later, Dagon lay decapitated with the palms of its hands across the threshold of the shrine. Because of the ark, as many as several thousand inhabitants of Beth Shemesh were struck down. Uzza died because he touched the ark. David brought the ark back into Zion with sacrifices and shouts of triumph. Later on Solomon brought the ark into the Temple in Jerusalem where he had made a sanctuary for it; and so on. All these things make it clear that the Ten Commandments were the holiest thing in the Israelite church. </p>

283. The Ten Commandments were the height of holiness for the Israelite church.<p>The Ten Commandments, being the starting-point of the Word and so of the church which was to be established among the Israelite nation, and being in short compass a summary of the whole of religion, making a link between God and man and man and God, were so holy that nothing holier could exist. Their outstanding holiness is evident from the following points.<p>The Lord Jehovah Himself came down on Mount Sinai in fire and accompanied by angels, and from there proclaimed them out loud, and the mountain was hedged about to prevent anyone approaching and being killed. Neither the priests nor the elders came near, but only Moses. The Commandments were written on two stone tablets by the finger of God. When Moses brought the tablets down the second time, his face shone. The tablets were afterwards laid up in the Ark, and this was at the centre of the Tabernacle. It was surmounted by the mercy-seat, above which were placed cherubim made of gold. This central area of the Tabernacle, where the Ark was, was called the Holy of Holies. Outside the veil, inside which the Ark was, were placed many objects to represent the holy things of heaven and the church; these were a table overlaid with gold on which the bread of the Presence was put, a golden altar on which to put incense, and a golden lamp-stand with seven lamps; also curtains all round made of fine linen, purple and scarlet. The holiness of the whole of this Tabernacle was entirely due to the law contained in the Ark.</p>
<p>
[2] It was on account of the holiness of the Tabernacle as containing the Ark, that the whole people of Israel were commanded to camp around it in the order of their tribes; and that they set out in order after it; and that there was a cloud over it by day and fire by night. It was because of the holiness of the law, and Jehovah's presence in it, that Jehovah spoke with Moses upon the mercy-seat between the cherubim; and that the Ark was called 'Jehovah-is-there'; and that Aaron was not allowed to go inside the veil except with sacrifices and incense, on pain of death. It was because of Jehovah's presence in and around the law, that miracles were done by means of the Ark containing the law. For instance, the waters of Jordan were parted, and the people crossed over on dry land so long as the Ark rested in its midst. Its being carried round the walls of Jericho caused them to fall down. Dagon, the god of the Philistines, first of all fell on his face in the presence of the Ark, and later was found lying with his head cut off together with the palms of his two hands upon the threshold of the shrine. On account of the Ark the men of Bethshemesh were smitten to the number of many thousands. Uzzah was killed by touching the Ark. The Ark was brought into Zion by David with sacrifice and jubilation. Later it was put by Solomon into the Temple at Jerusalem, and he made its inner shrine there. From these and many other details it is plain that the Ten Commandments were the height of holiness for the Israelite church. </p>

283. IN THE ISRAELITISH CHURCH THE DECALOGUE WAS HOLINESS ITSELF. <p>The commandments of the Decalogue were the first fruits of the Word and therefore the firstfruits of the church about to be established with the Israelitish nation, and as they were in a brief summary the complex of all things of religion, whereby there is a conjunction of God with man and of man with God, they were so holy that nothing could be holier. That they were most holy is clearly manifest from the following facts: That Jehovah Himself, the Lord, descended upon Mount Sinai in fire, accompanied by angels, and promulgated these laws therefrom by a living voice [and that the people were three days preparing themselves to see and hear], and that bounds were set round about the mountain, lest anyone should approach and die; and that neither the priests nor the elders drew near, but Moses only. That these commandments were written by the finger of God on two tables of stone. That when Moses brought those tables down the second time his face shone. That the tables were afterward deposited in the ark, and the ark was placed in the inmost of the tabernacle, and over it was placed the mercy-seat, and over this the golden cherubs; and that this inmost in the tabernacle, where the ark was, was called the holy of holies. That outside the veil, within which was the ark, various things were arranged representing the holy things of heaven and the church, namely, the table overlaid with gold on which was the bread of faces, the golden altar for incense, the golden lampstand with seven lamps, also the curtains round about, made of fine linen, purple and scarlet. The holiness of the whole tabernacle was from no other source than the law which was in the ark. On account of the holiness of the tabernacle from the law in the ark, the whole Israelitish people by command encamped around it in order according to their tribes, and marched in order after it; and there was then a cloud over it by day and a fire by night. On account of the holiness of that law, and the presence of Jehovah therein, Jehovah talked with Moses above the mercy-seat between the cherubs; and the ark was called "Jehovah there." That Aaron was not permitted to enter within the veil except with sacrifices and incense, lest he die. Also on account of the presence of Jehovah in and about the law, miracles were wrought by means of the ark which contained the law; as that the waters of Jordan were divided, and so long as the ark rested in the midst of the river the people passed over on dry ground; the walls of Jericho fell by the carrying of the ark around them; Dagon the god of the Philistines first fell on his face before it, and afterward lay upon the threshold of the temple with his head and the palms of his hands cut off. Because of the ark the Bethshemites were smitten to the number of several thousands; and Uzzah died because he touched it. The ark was brought by David into Zion with sacrifice and jubilation, and afterwards by Solomon into the temple at Jerusalem, of which it constituted the sanctuary; besides many other things. From all this it is clear that in the Israelitish church the Decalogue was holiness itself. </p>

283. IN THE ISRAELITISH CHURCH THE DECALOGUE WAS HOLINESS ITSELF<p>The Commandments of the Decalogue were the first principles of the Word, and consequently the first principles of the Church which was to be established among the Israelitish nation. They were moreover in short summary form an epitome of the whole of religion by which is effected the conjunction of God with man, and of man with God; consequently they were holy above all else. Their supreme holiness is clearly evident from the following circumstances. Jehovah Himself, the Lord, attended by angels, descended upon Mount Sinai in fire, and thence promulgated them by word of mouth. Bounds were set about the Mount lest anyone should approach and die. Neither the priests nor the Elders drew near, but Moses only. The Commandments were written on two tables of stone by the finger of God. The face of Moses shone when he brought down the two tables the second time. The tables were afterwards deposited in the ark, and this was placed in the inmost sanctuary of the tabernacle. Over the ark was placed the mercy-seat, above which were placed the golden cherubim. The inmost sanctuary of the tabernacle, where the ark was kept, was called the Holy of holies. Outside the veil, behind which was the ark, were placed many objects representing the holy things of heaven and the Church, namely, the table overlaid with gold, on which was the shew-bread, the golden altar of incense, and the golden lampstand with seven lamps, and also the curtains round about, made of fine linen, purple and scarlet. The holiness of the whole of this tabernacle was derived solely from the Law which was in the ark. On account of this holiness of the tabernacle, arising from the Law in the ark, all the people of Israel mere commanded to encamp about it in order, according to their tribes, and to march in order after it, when a cloud was over it by day, and a fire by night. On account of the holiness of the Law, and the presence of Jehovah in it, Jehovah talked with Moses from over the mercy seat between the cherubim, and the ark was called "The Presence of Jehovah." Aaron was not permitted to enter within the veil, except with sacrifices and incense, lest he should die.<p>On account of the presence of Jehovah in and about the Law miracles were also wrought by the ark, within which was the Law. Thus the waters of Jordan were divided, and while the ark rested in the midst of the river, the people passed over on dry ground. The walls of Jericho fell because the ark was carried round them. Dagon, the god of the Philistines, first fell down on his face before it, and afterwards lay, with his head and the palms of his hands cut off, upon the threshold of his temple. The Bethshemites, to the number of many thousands, were smitten on account of it, and Uzzah died because he touched it. The ark was brought, with sacrifice and jubilations, to Zion by David; and afterwards by Solomon into the temple at Jerusalem, where it constituted the sanctuary. From these and many other circumstances it is manifest that the Decalogue was holiness itself in the Israelitish Church. </p>

283. Quod Decalogus fuerit ipsa Sanctitas <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
in Ecclesia Israelitica.<p>Praecepta Decalogi, quia fuerunt Primitiae Verbi, et inde Primitiae Ecclesiae apud Gentem Israeliticam instaurandae, et quia erant in brevi summario Complexus omnium Religionis, per quae conjunctio Dei cum homine, et hominis cum Deo datur, ideo tam sancta fuerunt, ut nihil sanctius. Quod sanctissima fuerint, evidenter patet a sequentibus his: Quod Ipse Jehovah Dominus descenderit super Monte Sinai in igne et cum Angelis, et illa viva voce inde promulgaverit, et quod Mons circumseptus fuerit, ne quis accederet et moreretur; quod nec Sacerdotes neque Seniores appropinquarent, sed Moses solus. Quod Praecepta illa binis Tabulis lapideis digito Dei inscripta fuerint. Quod cum Moses, Tabulas illas secunda vice deportavit, facie radiaverit. Quod Tabulae postea repositae fuerint in Arca; et haec intime in Tabernaculo; et super illam datum sit Propitiatorium, et super hoc positi Cherubi ex auro: quod Intimum illud in Tabernaculo, ubi Arca erat, vocaretur Sanctum sanctorum. Quod extra Velum, intra quod illa Arca fuit, collocata sint plura, quae repraesentaverunt sancta Coeli et Ecclesiae, quae erant, Mensa obducta auro super qua Panes facierum, Altare aureum super quo suffimenta, et Candelabrum aureum cum septem Lucernis; tum Aulaea circum circa ex bysso, purpura, et coccino: Sanctitas totius hujus Tabernaculi non aliunde fuit, quam ex Lege quae fuit in Arca. Propter Sanctitatem Tabernaculi ex Lege in Arca, universus Populus Israeliticus circum illud in ordine secundum Tribus ex mandato castrametatus est; et in ordine post illud profectus; et tunc supra illud fuit Nubes interdiu, et Ignis noctu.</p>
<p>
[2] Propter Sanctitatem Legis illius, et praesentiam Jehovae in illa, loquebatur Jehovah super Propitiatorio inter Cherubos cum Mose; et Arca vocabatur Jehovah ibi. Quod non licuerit Aharoni intrare intra Velum, nisi cum sacrificiis et suffitu, ne moreretur. Propter Jehovae praesentiam in Lege illa et circum illam, etiam Miracula per Arcam, in qua Lex illa fuit, facta sunt: ut quod Aquae Jordanis discissae sint, et quamdiu Arca in medio ejus quiescebat, Populus in sicco transiverit. Quod per circumlationem ejus Muri Jerichuntis conciderint. Quod Dagon Deus Philisthaeorum coram illa primum super faciebus suis deciderit, et postea abscissus a capite cum duabus volis manuum super limine fani jacuerit: quod propter illam percussi sint Bethschemitae ad plura millia. Quod Usa, quia tetigit illam, mortuus sit. <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
Quod Arca illa introducta sit cum sacrificio et jubilis in Zionem a Davide: et quod postea a Salomone in Templum Hierosolymitanum, ubi faciebat ejus adytum; praeter plura; ex quibus patet, quod Decalogus fuerit ipsa Sanctitas in Ecclesia Israelitica.<p>
