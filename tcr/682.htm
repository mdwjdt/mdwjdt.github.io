<p>
682. In the Word, the "name of the Lord Jesus Christ" means acknowledging him and living by his commandments. For the reason why his name has these meanings, see the explanation of the second of the Ten Commandments [297-300], "You are not to take the name of God in vain" [<a href="3927/exodus_20_7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_11.htm">Deuteronomy 5:11</a>]. This is precisely what the name of the Lord means in the following passages.
<p>Jesus said, "You will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. " (<a href="3927/matthew_10_22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_24_9.htm">24:9</a>)
<p>Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there in the midst of them. (<a href="3927/matthew_18_20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>)
<p>As many as received him, he gave them power to be children of God, if they believed in his name. (<a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>)
<p>Many believed in his name. (<a href="3927/john_2_23.htm">John 2:23</a>)
<p>Those who do not believe have already been judged because they have not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. (<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>)
<p>Those who believe will have life in his name. (<a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>)
<p>You have labored for my name's sake and have not become worn out. (<a href="3927/revelation_2_3.htm">Revelation 2:3</a>)
<p>The phrase is used with the same meaning in other passages as well.
</p>
<p>
[2] Surely everyone can see that in these passages the name of the Lord does not mean just his name but also means acknowledging that he is the Redeemer and Savior, obeying him, and eventually coming to have faith in him.
<p>In baptism babies receive the sign of the cross on their forehead and chest, which is a sign that they are being initiated into acknowledging and worshiping the Lord.
<p>Our name also means our quality, because in the spiritual world all are named for the qualities they have. Therefore the name of being Christian means our quality of having faith in Christ and having goodwill toward our neighbor from Christ. This is what "name" means in the following passage in the Book of Revelation:
<p>The Son of Humankind says, "You have a few names in Sardis who have not gotten their clothes dirty and who will walk in white clothes with me, because they are worthy. " (<a href="3927/revelation_3_4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>)
<p>Walking in white clothes with the Son of Humankind means following the Lord and living by the truths of his Word.
</p>
<p>
[3] "Name" has a similar meaning in John:
<p>Jesus said, "The sheep hear my voice and I call my sheep by name and lead them out. I walk in front of the sheep and they follow me, because they know my voice. They do not follow a stranger, however, because they do not know the voice of strangers. " (<a href="3927/john_10_3.htm">John 10:3-5</a>)
<p>By name means by their quality as Christians; following him is hearing his voice, that is, obeying his commands. This is the "name" that all receive when they are baptized, in that it is part of the sign. </p>

<p>
682. The name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the Word means nothing other than His acknowledgment and living in accordance with His commandments. For the reason His name has that meaning, see the explanation of the second of the Ten Commandments, 'You are not to take the name of God in vain' [<a href="297.htm">297-299</a>]. This nothing else is meant by the Lord's name in these passages amongst others: <p>Jesus said, <p>You will be hated by all nations for my name's sake, <a href="3927/matthew_10_22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_24_9.htm">24:9-10</a>.<p>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst, <a href="3927/matthew_18_20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>.<p>As many as received Him, to them He gave the ability to be sons of God, if they believed in His name, <a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>.<p>Many believed in His name, <a href="3927/john_2_23.htm">John 2:23</a>.<p>He who does not believe is already judged, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God, <a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>.<p>Those who believe will have life in His name, <a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>.<p>You have laboured for the sake of my name, and have not wearied, <a href="3927/revelation_22_3.htm">Revelation 22:3</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] Can anyone fail to see that the Lord's name in those passages does not mean merely His name, but acknowledging Him as Redeemer and Saviour, and at the same time obeying Him, and finally having faith in Him? For at baptism a child receives the sign of the cross on his forehead and chest, and this is a sign of his initiation into the acknowledgment and worship of the Lord. One's name also means one's character; the reason is that in the spiritual world everyone is given a name to match his character. So naming someone a Christian means that his character is such that he has from Christ faith in Christ and charity towards the neighbour. This meaning of the name is to be seen in Revelation:<p>The Son of Man says, You have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their clothing; and they will walk with me in white clothing, because they are worthy, <a href="3927/revelation_3_4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>.<p>Walking with the Son of Man in white clothing means following the Lord, and living in accordance with the truths of His Word.</p>
<p>
[3] Name has a similar meaning in John:<p>Jesus said, The sheep hear my voice, and I call my own sheep by name, and I lead them out; I walk before them, and the sheep follow me, because they know my voice; but they do not follow a stranger, because they do not know strangers' voices, <a href="3927/john_10_3.htm">John 10:3-5</a>.<p>'By name' means by their character as Christians; 'following Him' is hearing His voice, that is, obeying His commandments. All receive this name at baptism, for it is contained in the sign. </p>

<p>
682. "The name of the Lord Jesus Christ" means in the Word nothing else than acknowledgment of Him, and a life according to His commandments. The reason why His name has that signification may be seen in the explanation of the second commandment of the Decalogue: <p>Thou shalt not take the name of God in vain (<a href="3927/exodus_20_7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>). <p>Nothing else is meant by the name of the Lord in the following passages: <p>Jesus said, Ye shall be hated of all nations for My name's sake (<a href="3927/matthew_10_22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_24_9.htm">24:9, 10</a>). <p>Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them (<a href="3927/matthew_18_20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>). <p>As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become sons of God, even to them that believe on His name (<a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>). <p>Many believed in His name (<a href="3927/john_2_23.htm">John 2:23</a>). <p>He that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God (<a href="3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17, 18</a>). <p>Those who believe shall have life in His name (<a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>). <p>For My name's sake thou hast labored, and hast not fainted (<a href="3927/revelation_2_3.htm">Revelation 2:3</a>). (And elsewhere.)
</p>
<p>
[2] Who does not see that "the name of the Lord" in these usages does not mean merely His name, but the acknowledgment of Him as being the Redeemer and Savior, together with obedience, and finally faith in Him? For in baptism the child receives the sign of the cross on the forehead and breast which is a sign of initiation into the acknowledgment and worship of the Lord. "Name" also means the quality of anyone; because in the spiritual world everyone is named according to his quality; therefore a man's taking the name Christian means his quality, - that he has from Christ faith in Christ and charity toward the neighbor. Such is the meaning of "name" in the Apocalypse: <p>The Son of man said, Thou hast a few names even in Sardis who have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy (<a href="3927/revelation_3_4.htm">3:4</a>). <p>"Walking with the Son of man in white" signifies following the Lord and living according to the truths of His Word. "Name" has the same meaning in John: <p>Jesus said, The sheep hear His voice, and He calleth His own sheep by name, and leadeth them out; He goeth before them and the sheep follow Him, for they know His voice; and a stranger they do not follow, they know not the voice of strangers (<a href="3927/john_10_3.htm">10:3-5</a>). <p>"By name" means by their quality, that they are Christians; and "to follow Him" is to hear His voice, that is, to obey His commandments. All receive this name in baptism, for it is involved in that sign. </p>

682. By the name of the Lord Jesus Christ nothing else is meant in the Word but an acknowledgment of Him and a life according to His commandments. The reason why His name signifies these things may be seen in the explanation of the second commandment of the Decalogue,<p>"Thou shalt not take the name... of God in vain" <a href="3927/exodus_20_7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>.<p>Nothing else is meant by the name of the Lord in these passages:<p>Jesus said, "Ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake" <a href="3927/matthew_10_22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_24_9.htm">24:9-10</a>.<p>"Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them" <a href="3927/matthew_18_20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>.<p>"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name. <a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>.<p>"Many believed in His name" <a href="3927/john_2_23.htm">John 2:23</a>.<p>"He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God" <a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>.<p>"Believing ye might have life through His name" <a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>.<p>"For my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted" <a href="3927/revelation_2_3.htm">Revelation 2:3</a>; and in other places.</p>
<p>
[2] Every one may see that in these passages the name of the Lord means not only His name, but the acknowledgment of Him as the Redeemer and Savior, and at the same time obedience to Him, and at length faith in Him. For at Baptism an infant receives the sign of the cross on his forehead and breast, which is a token of his inauguration into the acknowledgment and worship of the Lord. By name, too, is meant the character of anyone; because in the spiritual world every one is named according to his character; so that the name of Christian given to anyone means his character as having faith in Christ and charity towards the neighbor from Christ. This is meant by name in the Revelation:<p>The Son of Man said, "I have (A.V., Thou hast) a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy" <a href="3927/revelation_3_4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>.<p>To walk with the Son of Man in white, signifies to follow the Lord, and to live according to the truths of His Word.</p>
<p>
[3] The same is signified by name in John:<p>Jesus said, The sheep hear my voice, and I call my own sheep by name, and lead them out. I go before them, and the sheep follow me, for they know my voice. "A stranger will they not follow... for they know not the voice of strangers" <a href="3927/john_10_3.htm">10:3-4</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_6.htm">6</a>.<p>"By name," signifies, by their character as Christians; and to follow Him is to hear His voice, that is, to obey His commandments. This name all receive at Baptism, for it is involved in the sign. </p>

682. Per Nomen Domini Jesu Christi, non aliud in Verbo intelligitur, quam agnitio Ipsius et vita secundum praecepta Ipsius; quod nomen Ipsius illa significet, videas causam in Explicatione Secundi praecepti in Decalogo, Non feres Nomen Dei in vanum[, <a href="3927/exodus_20_7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>].

<p>
[2] quis non videre potest, quod per Nomen Domini in illis locis non intelligatur solum Nomen, sed agnitio Ipsius, quod sit Redemptor et Salvator, et simul obedientia, et tandem fides in Ipsum; in Baptismo enim Infans accipit signum crucis super fronte et pectore, quod est signum inaugurationis in agnitionem et cultum Domini. Per Nomen etiam intelligitur qualitas alicujus; causa est, quia in spirituali Mundo omnis secundum qualitatem ejus nominatur, quare per Nomen quod Christianus sit, intelligitur qualitas ejus quod fidem in Christum, et quod charitatem erga proximum, a Christo habeat; hoc intelligitur per Nomen in Apocalypsi, "Inquit Filius hominis, habes <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
