<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第7节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>7</b>.众所周知，基督教会的教义教导：神是一。这是因为，他们的一切教义均取自圣言；只要不仅口头上，而且发自内心承认一位神，这些教义就会连贯起来。对那些嘴上承认一位神，心里却认可三位神的人来说—这是如今基督教界很多人的情形，神只不过是挂在嘴上的一个词而已。他们的整个神学无非是锁在箱子里的一个金偶像，钥匙只在他们的领袖手里。这种人在阅读圣言时，在圣言中或从圣言感知不到任何亮光，甚至感知不到神是一。对他们来说，圣言仿佛沾染了污渍而模糊不清，而涉及神一体性的地方，则完全被污渍覆盖。主在马太福音中所描述的，就是这些人：<br />你们听是要听见，却不明白；看是要看见，却不晓得。他们眼睛闭着，恐怕眼睛看见，耳朵听见，心里明白，回转过来，让我医治他们。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.14.htm">马太福音13:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.15.htm">15</a>）<br />所有这些人就像那些逃避日光的人，他们把自己关进无窗的房子里，在墙上四处摸索，寻找食物和金钱。最后，他们获得一种如同猫头鹰那样的视力，从而能在黑暗中观看。他们类似于有数位丈夫的妇人，她不是真正的妻子，而是一个淫妇。他们又像一个接受数位追求者戒指的少女，婚后不仅跟一位过夜，还和其他追求者过夜。</p>

7. 眾所周知, 在基督徒世界的教會中, 他們的教義都教導說:上帝只有一位。他們如此教導, 是因為他們所有的教義都出自聖言。只有承認上帝的唯一(無論是嘴上還是心裡), 這些教義才會前後連貫。對於那些嘴上承認一位上帝, 而心裡卻思想著三位, 正如今時眾多基督教信徒這麼認為, 上帝只不過是掛在嘴上一個詞語而已。他們全部的神學只不過是個裝在神龕中的金偶像, 祭司們管著鑰匙。當這些人讀聖言時, 他們在聖言中或從聖言察覺不到任何亮光, 領悟不到上帝只是一位。對這些人, 聖言看起來如同沾了墨蹟變得模糊不清; 關於上帝的唯一, 全被墨蹟遮蓋了。主在『馬太福音』中如此描述這般人:你們聽是要聽見, 卻不明白; 看是要看見, 卻不曉得; 他們眼睛閉著, 恐怕眼睛看見, 耳朵聽見, 心裡明白, 回轉過來, 讓我醫治他們(<a href="3927/matthew_13_14.htm">馬太福音13:14-15</a>)。所有這些就如同人們避開亮光, 進到無窗的屋子, 挨著牆摸索, 尋找食物或金錢。最終獲得一種如同貓頭鷹一樣的視覺, 能在黑暗中看到東西。他們就像一個婦人有幾個丈夫, 她其實並不是個妻子, 只是個好色的娼妓而已。或者他們像一個處女, 接受好幾位追求者的婚戒。婚禮過後, 不只是跟一位洞房, 而且還跟其它追隨者行淫。 </p>

7. The churches in the Christian world teach one God; this is common knowledge. They teach this because all their teachings come from the Word, and those teachings are all integrated as long as one God is acknowledged not only orally but also with the heart. It is common in Christianity today, however, for people to confess one God with their lips but three with their hearts. To such people God is no more than a verbal expression. To them theology as a whole is a kind of golden idol locked up in a case, and the key to unlock it is held by church leaders alone. When such people read the Word they do not detect any light in it or from it - not even the impression that there is one God. To them the Word is marred with blotches, and the oneness of God in it is obscured. The Lord described people like this in Matthew: "You will hear with your hearing but you will not understand; and you will see by seeing, but you will not perceive. They have closed their eyes to avoid ever seeing with their eyes, hearing with their ears, understanding with their hearts, turning themselves around, and being healed by me" (<a href="3927/matthew_13_14.htm">Matthew 13:14-15</a>). All such Christians are like people who go into windowless rooms to avoid the light and who grope for food and coins by feeling their way along the walls. Eventually they develop eyesight like that of owls and see in the dark. They are like a woman who has many husbands - she is a promiscuous woman rather than a wife. They are like a young woman who accepts rings from multiple suitors, and after the wedding, rents out her nights not only to one of them but also to the rest. </p>

7. It is well known that the doctrines of the Christian churches teach that God is one. This is because all their doctrines are taken from the Word, and they hold together so long as one God is acknowledged not only with the lips but also in the heart. For those who acknowledge one God only with their lips, while in their hearts they admit three, which is what happens with many people in Christendom to-day, God is nothing more than a verbal expression. Their whole theology is nothing but a golden idol locked in a case, to which only their leaders have the key. When they read the Word, they do not receive any enlightenment about it and from it, not even the perception that God is one. For them the Word is, as it were, blotted with erasures and obscured where it speaks of the oneness of God. These are the people described by the Lord in Matthew.<p>Hearing you will hear and not understand, and seeing you will see and not discern. They have closed their eyes, so that they should not risk seeing with their eyes, and hearing with their ears, and understanding in their hearts, and so that they should not turn again and let me heal them, <a href="3927/matthew_13_14.htm">Matthew 13:14-15</a>.<p>All of these people are like those who run away from daylight, and shut themselves in windowless rooms, where they grope around the walls searching for food and money. Finally they are granted a power of sight like that of owls, so that they can see in the dark. They resemble a woman with several husbands, no true wife, but a wanton prostitute. They are like a girl who accepts rings from several suitors, and after she is married hires herself out for the night not just to one, but to the rest as well. </p>

7. It is known that the doctrines of the churches in the Christian world teach that God is one. This they teach because all their doctrines are from the Word, and so far as one God is acknowledged both with the lips and the heart these doctrines are consistent. To those who confess one God with the lips only, but in heart accept three, as is true of many at this day in Christendom, God is nothing but a word on the lips; and all their theology is a mere idol of gold enclosed in a shrine, the key to which the priests alone hold; and when such read the Word they perceive no light in it or from it, not even that God is one. To such the Word appears blurred with blots, and in regard to the unity of God entirely covered with them. It is these who are described by the Lord in Matthew: <p>In hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see and not discern. Their eyes they have closed, lest haply they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and should turn themselves and I should heal them (<a href="3927/matthew_13_14.htm">Matthew 13:14, 15</a>). <p>All these are like men shunning the light, and entering chambers without windows, and groping about the walls, searching for food or money, and at length acquiring a vision like that of birds of the night, seeing in darkness. They are like a woman having several husbands, who is not a wife but a lascivious courtesan; or they are like a virgin who accepts rings from several suitors, and after the nuptials bestows her favors not upon one only, but also upon the others. </p>

7. It is well known that the doctrines of the Christian Churches teach that God is One. They do so because all their doctrines are derived from the Word, and they are consistent in so far as they acknowledge one God not only with their lips but also with the heart. To those, however, who confess one God with the lilts, but in heart acknowledge three, as is the case with many in Christendom at this day, God is merely a name. To them the whole of theology is like a golden idol enclosed in a shrine, of which the priests alone possess the key. Moreover when they read the Word they do not perceive any light in it or proceeding from it, not even the truth that God is one. To such persons the Word appears, as it were, covered with blots, which obscure the Unity of God. These are they whom the Lord thus describes in Matthew:<p>"By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive;... their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them" <a href="3927/matthew_13_14.htm">13:14-15</a>.<p>All these are like men who shun the light, and enter dark rooms where there are no windows, and grope about in search of food or money, till at length they acquire a vision like that of owls, and see in the dark. They are like a woman with several husbands, who is not a wife but a lascivious courtesan; or like a virgin who accepts rings from several suitors, and who after marriage with one continues to make assignations with the others. </p>

7. Quod doctrinae Ecclesiarum in Christiano Orbe doceant, quod Deus unus sit, notum est; docent, quia ex Verbo sunt omnes doctrinae illarum, quae cohaerent, quantum unum Deum non solum ore, sed etiam corde agnoscunt: illi qui solum ore unum Deum, et tres corde confitentur, ut fit apud plures hodie in Christianismo, illis non aliud est Deus, quam duntaxat enuntiatum oris, et omne Theologicum illis non aliud est, quam sicut Idolum ex auro inclusum scrinio, ad quod clavis ad aperiendum est solum apud antistites, et illi quando legunt Verbum, non percipiunt aliquam lucem ibi et inde, et ne quidem quod Deus unus sit; Verbum illis est sicut lituris maculatum, et quoad unitatem Dei obtectum; hi sunt qui a Domino describuntur apud Matthaeum, "Auditu audietis, et non intelligetis, et videndo videbitis, et non cernetis: oculos suos occluserunt, ne forte videant oculis suis, et auribus audiant, et corde intelligant, et convertant se, et sanem illos," <a href="3927/matthew_13_14.htm">13:14-15</a>. Sunt omnes illi sicut qui lucem fugiunt, et intrant Cameras ubi non fenestrae <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
sunt, et palpitant circum parietes, et quaerunt ubi victus et ubi nummi; et tandem foenerantur visum noctuarum similem, et vident in tenebris: sunt hi similes mulieri, cui plures mariti sunt, quae non est uxor, sed lasciva meretrix: <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
suntque similes virgini, quae a pluribus procis annulos accipit, et post nuptias cum uno locat noctes; et quoque cum reliquis.<p>
