<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第11节 主在世时应验了圣言的全部，由此成为圣言，也就是神圣真理，甚至是以其最表层的形式</h4><br />261.主在世时应验了圣言的全部，由此成为神圣真理，也就是圣言，甚至是以其最表层的形式。这一事实就是约翰福音中这些话的意思：<br />道成了肉身，住在我们中间；我们见过祂的荣光，正是父独生子的荣光。祂充充满满地有恩典有真理。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">约翰福音1:14</a>）<br />“成了肉身”是指变成圣言的最表层。主变像时向门徒展示了圣言最表层的形像：<br />脸面明亮如日头，衣裳洁白如光。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.2.htm">马太福音17:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.2.htm">马可福音9:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.28.htm">路加福音9:28</a>）<br />在这些地方，经上说摩西和以利亚在荣光中显现。“摩西”表藉由摩西所写的圣言，以及总体上圣言的历史部分；“以利亚”表圣言的预言部分。约翰所看到的主（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.13.htm">启示录1:13</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.16.htm">16</a>）也表现为最表层形式上的圣言。那里描述主的一切细节表神圣真理或圣言的最表层形式。当然，主之前一直是圣言或神圣真理，不过是处在圣言的初始中。因为经上说：<br />太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">约翰福音1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.2.htm">2</a>）<br />道成为肉身之时，就是主成为圣言的最表层形式之时。这就是为何主被称为“首先的和末后的”（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.8.htm">启示录1:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.8.htm">2:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.6.htm">21:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.12.htm">22:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.6.htm">以赛亚书44:6</a>）。</p>

261. 主在世應驗了聖言的全部; 並藉著如此行, 祂成為聖言或聖理, 甚至在終極或最外在的層級
<p>當主在世時, 祂應驗了聖言的全部, 並藉著如此行, 祂成為聖理或聖言, 甚至在終極或最外在的層級。這個事實正是『約翰福音』中以下經文所表示的意思:道成了肉身, 住在我們中間; 我們見過祂的榮光, 正是父獨生子的榮光。祂充充滿滿地有恩典有真理(<a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">約翰福音1:14</a>)。"成肉身"表示成為聖言的終極和最外在的層級。
<p>當主變像時, 祂向門徒顯出聖言的終極和最外在的層級(<a href="3927/matthew_17_2.htm">馬太福音17:2</a>,<a href="3927/mark_9_2.htm">馬可福音9:2</a>,<a href="3927/luke_9_28.htm">路加福音9:28</a>及之後的內容)。在那裡說摩西和以利亞在榮光中顯現。"摩西"表示藉著摩西所寫的聖言, 以及聖言的歷史部分。"以利亞"表示聖言的先知部分。主作為聖言的終極和最外在層級的代表也同樣向約翰顯現過(<a href="3927/revelation_1_13.htm">啟示錄1:13-16</a>)。當中描述主的全部細節表示聖理或聖言的終極或最外在的特徵。
<p>當然, 在主降世之前就是道或聖理, 但是僅在最初或最內在的層級。我們讀到:"太初有道, 道與上帝同在, 道是上帝"(<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">約翰福音1:1-2</a>)。然而, 當道變成肉身, 主甚至成為聖言終極或最外在的層級。這就是為何主被成為"首先的和末後的"(<a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">啟示錄1:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_2_8.htm">2:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">22:12-13</a>;<a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">以賽亞書44:6</a>)。 </p>

261. 11. While in the World, the Lord Fulfilled Everything in the Word; by Doing So He Became the Word or Divine Truth Even on the Last or Outermost Level
<p>The fact that in the world the Lord fulfilled everything in the Word, and by doing so became divine truth or the Word even on the last or outermost level, is what the following words in John mean:
<p>And the Word became flesh and lived among us; and we saw his glory, glory like that of the only begotten child of the Father. He was full of grace and truth. (<a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">John 1:14</a>)
<p>"Becoming flesh" means becoming the Word on the last or outermost level.
<p>When the Lord was transfigured, he showed his disciples his qualities as the Word on the last or outermost level (<a href="3927/matthew_17_2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a> and following; <a href="3927/mark_9_2.htm">Mark 9:2</a> and following; <a href="3927/luke_9_28.htm">Luke 9:28</a> and following). There it says that Moses and Elijah appeared in glory. "Moses" means the Word that was written by Moses, and the historical Word in general. "Elijah" means the prophetical Word. The Lord was represented as the Word on the last or outermost level to John as well (). All the details of that description of the Lord mean the last or outermost features of divine truth or the Word.
<p>The Lord was of course the Word or divine truth before he came, but only on the first or inmost level. We read, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>). When the Word became flesh, however, the Lord became the Word even on the last or outermost level. This is why the Lord is called the First and the Last (<a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_2_8.htm">2:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">22:12-13</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>). </p>

261. XI. The Lord when in the world fulfilled everything in the Word, and thus became the Word, that is, Divine truth, even in its outermost form.<p>The Lord's fulfilling when in the world everything in the Word, and thus becoming Divine truth, that is, the Word, even in its outermost form, is what is meant by these words in John:<p>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">John 1:14</a>.<p>Being made flesh is becoming the Word in its outermost form. The Lord showed the disciples, when He was transfigured, what the Word is like in its outermost form (<a href="3927/matthew_17_2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>ff; <a href="3927/mark_9_2.htm">Mark 9:2</a>ff; <a href="3927/luke_9_28.htm">Luke 9:28</a>ff). In these places it is said that Moses and Elijah were seen in glory; Moses means the Word which was written by means of him, and the historical part of the Word in general, Elijah the prophetical part. The Lord as seen by John in Revelation (<a href="3927/revelation_1_13.htm">Revelation 1:13-16</a>) was also represented as the Word in its outermost form. All the details of His description there mean the outermost form of Divine truth, that is, the Word. The Lord had indeed previously been the Word or Divine truth, but in its first beginnings; for it is said:<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>.<p>But when the Word was made flesh, then the Lord became the Word even in its outermost form. That is why He is called 'the First and the Last' (<a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_2_8.htm">2:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">22:12-13</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>). </p>

261. XI. THE LORD WHEN IN THE WORLD FULFILLED ALL THINGS OF THE WORD, AND THEREBY BECAME THE WORD, THAT IS, DIVINE TRUTHS EVEN IN THINGS LAST. <p>That the Lord when in the world fulfilled all things of the Word, and thereby became Divine truth, or the Word, even in things last, is meant by these words in John: <p>And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth (<a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">John 1:14</a>). <p>"To become flesh" is to become the Word in things last. What the Lord was as the Word in things last, He showed to His disciples when he was transfigured (<a href="3927/matthew_17_2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a> seq.;<a href="3927/mark_9_2.htm">Mark 9:2</a> seq.;<a href="3927/luke_9_28.htm">Luke 9:28</a>), where it is said that Moses and Elias appeared in glory, "Moses" meaning the Word written through him, and in general the historical Word, and "Elias" the prophetical Word. The Lord as the Word in things last was also represented before John in Revelation (<a href="3927/revelation_1_13.htm">1:13-16</a>), where all things in the description of Him signify the outmosts of Divine truth, or of the Word. Before this the Lord was indeed the Word or Divine truth, but in things first, for it is said: <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1, 2</a>); <p>but when the Word became flesh, the Lord also became the Word in things last. This is why He is called: <p>The First and the Last (<a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_2_8.htm">2:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_13.htm">22:13</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>). </p>

261. XI. THE LORD, WHEN HE WAS IN THE WORLD, FULFILLED ALL THINGS IN THE WORD, AND THUS BECAME THE WORD, THAT IS, DIVINE TRUTH, EVEN IN ULTIMATES.<p>That the Lord when in the world fulfilled all things in the Word, and thus became Divine Truth, or the Word, even in ultimates, is meant by the following passage in John:<p>"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth" <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">1:14</a>.<p>To be made flesh is to become the Word in ultimates; and what the Lord was, as the Word in ultimates, He showed to His disciples when He was transfigured,<p><a href="3927/matthew_17_2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a> and following; <a href="3927/mark_9_2.htm">Mark 9:2-9</a>; and <a href="3927/luke_9_28.htm">Luke 9:28-36</a>.<p>It is there said that Moses and Elias appeared in glory; and by Moses is meant the Word which was written by him, and in general the historical Word, and by Elias the prophetical Word. The Lord, as the Word in ultimates, was also represented before John in the <a href="3927/revelation_1_13.htm">Revelation 1:13-16</a>, where all the details in the description of Him signify the ultimates of Divine Truth, or of the Word. The Lord before the Incarnation was indeed the Word or Divine Truth, but in first principles; for it is said:<p>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>.<p>When, however, the Word was made flesh, then the Lord became the Word in ultimates also; and from this fact He is called The First and the Last. <a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_2_8.htm">2:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_13.htm">22:13</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>. </p>
