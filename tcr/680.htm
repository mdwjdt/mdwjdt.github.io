<p>
680. To continue, what is a design without a hierarchy of elements? What is a hierarchy without levels? And what are levels without signs to make it known how high in the hierarchy a given level is? Without information about the various levels, a hierarchy is not recognizable as a hierarchy. In empires and monarchies, the signs or distinguishing indicators are the titles of the various positions and the administrative responsibilities they entail. These lead to chains of command through which all are coordinated as a single unit. This is how a monarch exercises royal power through a hierarchy of many subordinates; this allows the nation to function as a nation.
</p>
<p>
[2] The same is true of many other things. Take armies for example. How much power would they have if they were not precisely differentiated into battalions, and then into companies, and then into squads, so that every soldier has an immediate superior, and there is one supreme commander over all? What would that structure be without the signs that are called standards or colors, to show where each soldier ought to be? This organized structure allows all the soldiers in a battle to act as one. Without it, they would rush at the enemy like a pack of dogs with their mouths open, barking their ineffectual rage, only to be helplessly mowed down by a well-organized enemy arrayed in straight lines. What power do the divided have against the united?
<p>These examples are intended to illustrate the first function of baptism: Baptism is a sign in the spiritual world that the individual in question belongs among Christians. All people in the Christian part of the spiritual world are integrated into a given community or horde depending on how genuinely Christian they are. </p>

<p>
680. Moreover, what is order without rank? And what is rank without badges? And what are badges without signs by which ranks may be known? For unless ranks are known, order cannot be recognised as order. The signs or distinguishing marks in empires and kingdoms are the titles of rank and the administrative rights attached to them. From these are derived the subordinate offices, by means of which all are organised as it were to make one body. In this way a king exercises his royal power distributed in due order among many people, and this is what makes a kingdom a kingdom.</p>
<p>
[2] Much the same happens in very many other cases, for instance in armies. What strength would they have, if they were not grouped in orderly fashion into platoons, and these into companies and these into battalions? And if each group did not have its subordinate officer in charge of it and there was one commander over all? What would be the use of those orderings without signs, what are called colours, to show in what position each is to be? Such means ensure that in battle they all act as one, and without them they would rush on the enemy like packs of dogs with gaping jaws, howling and useless frenzy. Then all without any display of bravery would be cut down by an enemy arranged into proper lines of battle; for what can men divided do against men united? These examples illustrate the first purpose of baptism, which is a sign in the spiritual world that a person belongs to the Christians; and there each is brought into communities and congregations in accordance with the quality of the Christianity in him or outside him. </p>

<p>
680. Furthermore, what is order without distinction, and what is distinction without its evidences, and what are evidences without signs by which qualities are recognized? For without an acquaintance with the qualities order is not recognized as order. In empires and kingdoms the signs or marks of distinction are titles of rank, and the administrative rights attached to them; and from this comes subordination, by means of which all are coordinated as it were into a one. In this way the king exercises his royal power, which is distributed among many according to order, and it is from this that the kingdom becomes a kingdom. It is the same in many other matters, as for example in armies. <p>What power would they have if they were not distinctly organized into regiments, these into battalions, and these again into companies, with subordinate officers each, and over all one commander in chief? And what would those arrangements amount to without the signs called standards, which indicate the proper station for each? By such means in battle all act as a one, while without them they would rush upon the enemy merely like a pack of hounds with open mouths, yells, and empty fury; and then, with their courage gone, they would be ingloriously cut in pieces by the enemy formed in well-ordered ranks; for what can those who are divided do against those who are united? Hereby is illustrated this first use of baptism, which is, to serve as a sign in the spiritual world that the one baptized belongs to Christians, for in that world everyone is inserted into societies and congregations according to the quality of the Christianity in him or outside of him. </p>

<p>
680. Moreover, what is order without distinctiveness, and what is distinctiveness without its proofs, and what are proofs without the signs by which separate qualities are recognized? For without a knowledge of qualities, order is not recognized as order. Signs or sign-manuals in empires and kingdoms are titles of dignities and rights of administration attached to them. From these are derived subordinate ranks, and by their means all are organized as into one. In this way a king exercises, according to order, his regal power distributed among many; and in this way a kingdom becomes a kingdom.<p>The case is similar in many other things, as for instance in armies. What strength would they have unless they were divided with due regard to order into regiments, these into battalions, and these again into companies, and unless subordinate officers were appointed over each, with one in supreme command over all? And what would those dispositions amount to without the signs, called standards, to show where each should be stationed? By these means all act in battle as one; whereas without them they would rush against the enemy like packs of dogs with open mouths, shouts and empty fury; and then all, their courage gone, would be cut to pieces by an enemy drawn up in ordered ranks; for what can those who are divided do against those who are united? These illustrations may serve to show this first use of Baptism, which is a sign in the spiritual world that a person comes from the company of Christians. For in that world every one is placed in a society, and in a congregation of it, according to the quality of the Christianity which is within him or which outwardly surrounds him. </p>

quid Ordo absque distinctione, et quid distinctio absque indiciis, et quid indicia absque signis, per quae cognoscantur qualitates, nam absque notitia qualitatum ordo non cognoscitur ut ordo: signa seu signaturae in Imperiis et in Regnis, sunt Tituli dignitatum, et Jura administrationis illis addicata, inde subordinationes, per quas coordinantur omnes sicut in unum; hoc modo Rex regiam suam potestatem secundum ordinem inter plures distributam exercet, ex quo Regnum fit Regnum.</p>

<p>
[2] Simile in perplurimis rebus aliis, ut in Exercitibus; quid valoris foret illis, nisi illi ordinate distincti essent in phalanges, hae in cohortes, et hae in turmas, et singulis praefecti sint minores duces, et omnibus unus qui supremus; et quid Ordinationes illae absque signis, quae vocantur Vexilla, quae indicent in qua statione quisque erit; per talia omnes in proeliis sicut unum agunt, et absque illis ruerent contra hostem non aliter quam sicut catervae canum cum rictibus apertis, ululatu et furore inani, et tunc omnes absque fortitudine ab hoste in justas acies composito, trucidarentur, nam quid divisi contra unitos. Per haec illustratur primus hic usus baptismi, qui est signum in Mundo spirituali, quod sit ex Christianis; ubi quisque inseritur societatibus et congregationibus ibi secundum qualitatem Christianismi in illo aut extra illum.<p>
