<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>230</b>.有人或许认为，纯正真理的教义能凭通过对应学而被赋予的圣言属灵之义获得。但教义并非由此获得，属灵之义仅起到说明和确认的作用。因为如前所述（208节），知道一点对应学的人有可能歪曲圣言，通过拼接这些东西，用来证实根深蒂固的信条。而且，唯有主赐给人属灵之义，并守护它，如同守护天使天堂，因为天堂拥有属灵之义。</p>

230. 或許有人認為, 純正真理的教義能藉著探究聖言的屬靈意義,通過對應關係的研究來獲得。事實上, 教義並非由此獲得, 只是以屬靈意義來啟發和確證教義; 正如之前(<a href="208.htm">208</a>節)所述, 掌握少許對應知識的人們能通過連接與應用這些對應知識, 來支持自己腦中根深蒂固的先入之見, 並以此來歪曲聖言。
<p>另外, 唯有受主所賜, 無人能得屬靈意義。主保護屬靈意義如同祂保護天國, 因為天國居於其中。 </p>

230. You might think that we could gain a body of genuinely true teaching by exploring the Word's spiritual meaning through the study of correspondences. In fact, a body of teaching is not gained through that meaning; it is only enlightened and corroborated by that meaning, for, as I said before in 208, people who know a few correspondences are capable of falsifying the Word by connecting and applying correspondences to support some preconceived idea already lodged in their mind.
<p>For another thing, no one is given the spiritual meaning except by the Lord alone. The Lord safeguards that meaning as he safeguards the angelic heaven, for heaven dwells in it. </p>

230. It might be thought that the doctrine of genuine truth could be acquired by means of the spiritual sense of the Word, of which we are granted knowledge by correspondences. But doctrine is not acquired through this, merely illustrated and confirmed; for, as was said before (208), a person who knows a few correspondences can falsify the Word, by combining and applying them to prove whatever the principles he has adopted have established in his mind. What is more, the spiritual sense is not granted to anyone except by the Lord, and He guards it, just as the heaven of the angels is guarded, for this heaven possesses this sense. </p>

230. It may be supposed that the doctrine of genuine truth can be acquired by means of the spiritual sense of the Word, which is given through a knowledge of correspondences; but doctrine is not acquired by means of that sense, but only illustrated and corroborated. For (as before said, n. <a href="208.htm">208</a>) it is possible for a man, by means of some well-known correspondences, to falsify the Word by bringing these together and applying them to confirm what is established in his own mind by some principle already adopted. Moreover, it is by the Lord only that the spiritual sense is communicated to any man; and it is guarded by the Lord as He guards the angelic heaven, for heaven is in that sense. </p>

230. It may be supposed that the doctrine of genuine truth can be acquired by means of the spiritual sense of the Word, which is obtained through a knowledge of correspondences. Doctrine, however, cannot be acquired by such means, but only illustrated and corroborated. For as was stated above in<a href="208.htm">208</a> it is possible for a man to falsify the Word, by connecting and applying some correspondences he may know to confirm what is firmly held in his mind and based on some principle which he has assumed. Moreover, the spiritual sense is not communicated to any one except by the Lord alone, and He guards it as He guards the angelic heaven, for heaven is within it. </p>

230. Credi potest quod Doctrina genuini veri comparari possit per Sensum spiritualem Verbi, qui datur per scientiam correspondentiarum; at Doctrina per illum non comparatur, sed modo illustratur et corroboratur, nam ut prius <a href="208.htm">208</a> dictum est, potest homo Verbum per aliquot Correspondentias notas falsificare, conjungendo et applicando illas ad confirmandum id quod Menti ejus ex principio capto inhaeret. Praeterea Sensus spiritualis non datur alicui nisi a Solo Domino, et custoditur ab Ipso, sicut custoditur Coelum angelicum, nam hoc in illo est. </p>
