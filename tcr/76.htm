<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>76</b>．记事一：<br />一天，我正默想宇宙的创造，被我右上方的天使察觉，那里也有一些天使时不时地默想和推理这个问题。于是，其中一位天使降下来，邀请我加入他们。我进入灵里，与他同去。一到那里，我便被带到君主面前，看到他的大厅里有数百会众，君主就在他们中间。然后，其中一位说：“我们在此注意到，你深入思考过宇宙的创造，这个问题我们也想过好几次，但始终得不出一个结论。因为我们的思维总是粘附着像巨蛋样的混沌概念，宇宙万物依次从这个巨蛋样的混沌中被孵化出来。然而，我们发觉，如此浩瀚的宇宙不可能这样孵化出来。困扰我们的另一个观念是，神从无创造了万物。不过，我们同样发觉，没有什么东西出自无。我们的思想无法摆脱这两个观念，不清楚创造到底是如何发生的。为此，我们将你从你所在的地方召上来，请你说说你对这个问题的看法。”<br />听到这里，我回答：“当然可以。”于是我说：“我曾对这个问题深入思考过很长时间，但一点眉目也没有。不过，由于我被主带入你们的世界，我才发现，若不首先认识到两个世界的存在，一个是天使所在的世界，另一个是世人所在的世界，并且世人通过死亡从自己的世界进入另一个世界，那么试图对宇宙创造形成一个结论是徒劳的。后来我还发现，有两轮太阳存在，一切属灵之物从这个太阳发出，而一切属世之物则从另一轮太阳发出；发出一切属灵之物的这轮太阳无非是来自耶和华神的爱，祂就在这太阳当中；而发出一切属世之物的那轮太阳无非是火。了解到这些事实后，我一度处于启示状态，得以领悟到，耶和华神凭借祂在当中的那轮太阳创造了整个宇宙；由于爱离开智慧无法存在，所以耶和华神出于爱凭借智慧创造了宇宙。我通过目睹你们所在世界和我的肉身所在世界的一切事物确信，这是千真万确的事实。<br />“要解释创造如何自其初始状态发展的，这会占用大量篇幅。不过，我处于启示状态期间曾领悟到：属灵的大气从你们世界的太阳凭借热和光一个接一个被创造出来，这些大气本身是实质的。由于大气有三种，随之有三个层级，所以有三层天堂被建立。一层天堂为具有最高等爱与智慧的天使而建；另一层天堂为具有次等爱与智慧的天使而建；再一层天堂为具有最低等爱与智慧的天使而建。不过，属灵的宇宙无法离开属世的宇宙而存在，它要在属世宇宙中产生它的结果和功用（或服务），故与此同时，另一轮太阳被创造出来，一切属世之物皆从它发出，并且三种大气同样通过它凭借热和光被创造出来，这三种大气包裹前三种大气，如同壳包裹核，或树皮包裹木头；最后，水陆球体凭借这些大气通过由土壤、石头和矿物构成的尘世物质被创造出来，成为人类、动物、鱼类、树木、灌木和植被的家园。<br />“这只是有关创造发生发展的一个极其笼统的轮廓。要解释其中的一切具体细节和步骤，则需要花费很多卷书。不过，所有这一切都指向这样的结论：神并非从无创造了这个宇宙，因为如你们所说，没有什么东西出于无，而是神凭借天使天堂的太阳创造了宇宙。这太阳来自祂的存在，因而完全是爱与智慧。宇宙万物－我所说的宇宙是指灵界和尘世，都见证并证实，宇宙是通过圣爱藉着圣智被造的。若凭借照亮你们理解力的觉察之光按适当次序和关联考虑这些事，你们就能清楚明白这一点。但是，必须谨记，在神里面合而为一的爱与智慧并非抽象意义上的爱与智慧，而是作为实质存在于祂里面。因为神是独一无二，因而是最初的实质和本质，这实质和本质就是存在和持续存在本身。<br />“万有都是通过圣爱与圣智被造的，这就是约翰福音中这句经文所表示的：<br />道与神同在，道就是神。万物是藉着祂造的，世界也是藉着祂造的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">约翰福音1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.10.htm">10</a>）<br />神在此表示圣爱，道（即圣言）表示圣真，或圣智。这就是为何道（即圣言）在此被称为光的原因；当论及神时，光表示圣智。”当我说完这番话，正要道别时，一道光芒从那里的太阳经由天使天堂照射下来，并进入他们的眼睛，由此进入他们心灵的居所。被如此启示后，他们都赞同我所说的话，然后护送我到前厅；先前那个同伴把我送回家，并从那里升回他自己的社群。</p>

76. 第一個經歷:
<p>有一天, 我正在冥想宇宙被造的問題。我右上方的天人們注意到我在冥想。與他們一起的幾位天人也就這個主題思想和討論過這個問題。因此, 其中一位天人下來邀請我加入他們之列。我進入靈裡與這天人一道。
<p>進到他們的社區後, 我被帶到他們的領袖那裡。那裡有上百人聚集, 領袖在中間。其中一位說:"我們有過好幾次類似的冥想, 但總是得不到結論。因為總有一個問題困擾著我們的思想:宇宙萬物在巨蛋般的混沌中依次孵化。然而, 我們現在看到這宇宙浩瀚,根本無法如此孵化。另一個困擾我們思想的問題:上帝從無創造萬物。然而現在我們意識到, 沒有什麼能從無造出。我們的思緒無法跳出這兩點困擾, 因而無法真正明白宇宙被造如何發生。這就是我們我們召你上來, 希望你能公開一下關於這點你是怎麼想的。"
<p>[2]"我確實在思考這個問題, "我回答:"不過長時間來沒有答案。後來, 當我被主准許進入你們的世界, 我才認識到若不先弄清下面幾個事實, 想得出結論都是徒勞。這些事實是:有兩個世界, 一個是天人所在的, 一個是人所在的。人死後, 從這個世界到另一個世界。我還看到, 有兩個太陽, 一切屬靈事物從其中之一發出, 所有物質事物從另一個發出。產生屬靈事物的太陽由耶和華上帝而來的仁愛組成, 祂在那太陽當中。而產生物質事物的太陽則是完全是火。
<p>"當我意識到這些, 有一次處於一種光照的狀態時, 領悟到:宇宙是耶和華上帝通過祂位於其中的太陽而被造。又因為仁愛無法離開智慧而存在, 也就是宇宙是耶和華上帝由祂的仁愛,藉著祂的智慧而被造。通過在你們所處世界以及在我肉身所在世界的所見所聞, 我確信這些是真的。
<p>[3]"我還領悟到:從你們所在心靈世界的太陽發出的光和熱, 一個接一個的屬靈氛圍被創造。共有三個, 因而有三層, 三層天因此被造:一個是為了最高等級之仁與智的天人, 一個是為了中等層次, 第三個是為了最低層次。
<p>"心靈世界在物質世界中發揮作用以及成就服務, 因此若無一個對應的物質世界成立, 這個心靈的世界就無法成立。於是, 太陽作為物質世界的源頭同時被造。這太陽用同樣的方式, 藉著它的光與熱, 三個氛圍被造,並圍繞先前的三個屬靈的氛圍, 就像殼包著核,或者樹皮包著木頭。最終, 通過這些氣氛, 有陸地和海洋,由泥土,石頭和礦物構成的地球被造, 其上是人類,動物,魚類,樹木,花草等棲息之所。
<p>[4]"關於創世及其步驟, 以上只是個非常籠統的草圖。要解釋所有具體步驟和細節, 需要大量篇幅來完成。不過所有的內容都會引向這個結論:上帝並非從無而造宇宙。正如你們所說, 沒有什麼會從無造出。上帝通過天國的太陽來創造宇宙——這太陽源自祂的根本, 因而是純全的仁愛及相隨的智慧。宇宙中的所有細節事物——我的意思指心靈和物質(或屬靈和屬世)兩個世界中的萬有, 都可以見證與證明:宇宙是由聖仁藉著聖智而被造的。如果你將所見的現象連貫起來考慮, 並藉著你領悟的亮光所照, 你將會清楚看見。
<p>"不過要謹記, 在上帝之中合為一的仁與智並非抽象的仁與智, 而是實質的存在於祂裡面。因為上帝是絕對的,首先的,唯一的實質與本質, 自行存在並持續存在。
<p>[5]"萬有由聖仁和聖智而造, 『約翰福音』中的話可表達這層意思:'道與上帝同在, 道就是上帝。萬物是藉著祂造的, 世界是藉著祂造的'(<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">約翰福音1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_10.htm">10</a>)。此處的上帝表示聖仁,道表示聖智。在那段經文中, 道被稱為"光"; 論到上帝時, 光表示聖智。"
<p>當我正說再見時, 從天上射下一道光芒, 照進他們的眼睛,並進入他們的思想。如此光照下, 他們贊同我所說的內容。然後, 他們陪我一起到門口, 帶我上來的夥伴把我送回住處, 接著他就回到他自己的社區。 </p>

76. The first memorable occurrence. One day I was in a meditation on the creation of the universe. Angels who were above me to the right noticed my meditation. Their region had had a number of meditations and debates on that same subject. Therefore one of them came down and invited me to join them. I came into my spirit and accompanied the angel.
<p>After I entered their community I was brought to its leader. In the leaders court I saw a gathering of about a hundred, with the leader in the middle. One of them said, "We became aware up here that you were meditating on the creation of the universe. A number of times we have been in similar meditations, but were unable to come to a conclusion. This was because there was an idea stuck in our minds - an idea of chaos as a great egg from which everything in the universe hatched in sequence. Now, however, we see that the universe is too large to have hatched in this way. There was another idea stuck in our minds as well: that God created everything out of nothing. Now we realize that nothing is made of nothing. Nevertheless our thinking has not yet been able to evolve far enough beyond these two ideas to see with any illumination how creation actually came about. For that reason we called you away from where you were in hopes that you would disclose your meditation on the subject. "
</p>
<p>
[2] Hearing that, I replied, "I will indeed.
<p>"For a long time I meditated on this without success," I went on. "Later, when the Lord sent me into your world, I became aware of the futility of drawing any conclusions about the creation of the universe without first knowing several facts: There are two worlds: the one in which there are angels, and the other in which there are people. Through death people cross over from their own world into the other world. Then I also saw that there are two suns. All spiritual things flow forth from one of them; all physical things from the other. The sun that all spiritual things flow from consists of pure love from Jehovah God; he is within that sun. The sun that all physical things flow from consists of pure fire.
<p>"After I realized this, on one occasion when I was in a state of enlightenment I was granted the insight that the universe was created by Jehovah God through the sun that surrounds him. Because love does not exist apart from wisdom, I could also see that the universe was created by Jehovah God from his love through his wisdom. Since then, everything I have seen in the world where you are and everything I have seen in the world where I am in my body convinces me of the truth of this.
</p>
<p>
[3] "It would take too long to lay out the way creation progressed from the very beginning; but when I was in a state of enlightenment I saw that there were spiritual atmospheres that were created by means of the heat and light from the sun in your world. At their core those atmospheres are substantial. Each one led to the next. Because there were three of these atmospheres, and therefore three levels of them, three heavens were made - one for angels who are at the highest level of love and wisdom, another for angels at the second level, and a third for angels at the lowest level.
<p>"This spiritual universe could not exist, however, without a physical universe in which it could accomplish its useful effects. Therefore at the same time a sun was created as the source of all things physical. Through this sun by means of its heat and light three atmospheres were created to surround those prior atmospheres the way a nutshell surrounds a kernel or the inner bark of a tree surrounds the wood. Finally, through these atmospheres the globe of lands and seas was created. Here people, animals, and fish, and trees, bushes, and plants were created out of earthly materials consisting of soils, stones, and minerals.
</p>
<p>
[4] "This is only a very general sketch of creation and its stages. The particular and individual stages could not be explained without filling volumes of books. They would all come to the following conclusion, though: that God did not create the universe out of nothing. As you said, nothing is made out of nothing. God created the universe through the sun in the angelic heaven - a sun that comes from his underlying reality and is therefore pure love together with wisdom. The universe, meaning both worlds (the spiritual and the physical), was created out of divine love through divine wisdom, as every single thing in it witnesses and attests. If you consider phenomena in the universe in a coherent and sequential way and set them in the light you already possess in your intellectual perceptions, you will see this clearly.
<p>"You must keep in mind, though, that the love and the wisdom that become one in God are not love and wisdom in the abstract. Think of them as a substance in him. God is the absolute, the first, and the only substance or essence that exists in itself and subsists of itself.
</p>
<p>
[5] "That everything is created out of divine love and wisdom is the meaning of the following words in John: The Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by it, and the world was made by it (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_10.htm">10</a>). God there means divine love and the Word means divine truth or divine wisdom. In that passage the Word is called light. Light, when it is said of God, means divine wisdom. "
<p>After this, as I was saying goodbye, sparkles of light from the sun in that world came down through the angelic heavens into their eyes, and passed through their eyes into the dwellings of their minds. Enlightened in this way, they expressed agreement with what I had said. Afterward they accompanied me out to the entrance. My companion from before journeyed with me to the house where I was, and then went back up to his community. </p>

76. The first experience.<p>One day I had been meditating on the creation of the universe. This was noticed by the angels above me to the right, where there were some who had several times meditated and reasoned about the same matter; so one of them came down and invited me to join them. I passed into the spirit and accompanied him; on my arrival I was brought to the prince, in whose hall I saw as many as a hundred assembled with the prince in their midst.<p>Then one of them said: 'We noticed here that you have meditated about the creation of the universe, a subject which has several times occupied our thoughts. But we were unable to reach a conclusion because our thinking clung to the idea of chaos being like a great egg, from which everything in the universe in its due order was hatched. Yet now we perceive that such a vast universe could not have been hatched like this. Another idea which stuck in our minds was that everything was created by God from nothing; yet now we perceive that nothing comes from nothing. Our minds have not yet been able to disentangle themselves from these two ideas and shed a little light on how creation happened. For this reason we have summoned you from the place where you were, to expound your thinking on the subject.'</p>
<p>
[2] 'I will indeed,' I replied on hearing this. 'I meditated on this,' I said, 'for a long time but to no purpose. But later, when I was admitted by the Lord into your world, I perceived that it was futile to form any conclusions about the creation of the universe, unless it were first known that there were two worlds, one occupied by angels and the other by men; and that men after death pass from their world into the other. Then I also saw that there are two suns, one from which pour forth all spiritual things, and one from which pour forth all natural things; and that the sun from which all spiritual things pour forth is pure love from Jehovah God, who is in its midst, while the sun from which all natural things pour forth is pure fire. When I had grasped these facts, once when I was in a state of enlightenment, I was granted the perception that the universe was created by Jehovah God by means of the sun in the midst of which He is; and because love cannot exist except together with wisdom, that the universe was created by Jehovah God from His love by means of His wisdom. I have been convinced of the truth of this by everything I have seen in the world where you are, and in the world where I am at present in the body.</p>
<p>
[3] 'It would be too tedious to explain how creation progressed from its first beginning. But while I was in a state of enlightenment I perceived that by means of the light and heat from the sun of your world, one after another spiritual atmospheres were created, which are in themselves substantial. Because there are three of them, and they therefore have three degrees, three heavens were made, one for angels in the highest degree of love and wisdom, one for angels in the second degree, and a third for angels in the lowest degree. But because this spiritual universe could not come into being without a natural universe, in which the spiritual one might produce its effects and perform its services, at the same time the sun which is the source of all natural things was created; and through this in the same way, by means of light and heat, three atmospheres were created to surround the first three, like a shell round a kernel or bark round wood; and it was finally through these that the globe with its lands and seas was created from the earth consisting of soil, stones and minerals, to be the home of men, animals, fish, trees, shrubs and plants.</p>
<p>
[4] 'This is an extremely general outline of how creation took place and progressed. It would take a series of books to explain all the particular details; but all lead to this conclusion, that God did not create the universe from nothing, since, as you said, nothing comes of nothing, but through the sun of the heaven of angels, which is from His Being (Esse) and so is pure love together with wisdom. Every single detail of the universe, by which I mean both the spiritual and natural worlds, bears witness and proclaims that the universe was created from the Divine love by the Divine wisdom. This you can clearly see, if you consider these facts in due order and in their connexions, by the light which illuminates the perceptions of your understanding. But it should be kept in mind that the love and wisdom, which in God make one, are not love and wisdom in the abstract, but are in Him as substance. For God is the very, sole and consequently prime substance and essence, which is and continues in existence in itself.</p>
<p>
[5] All things being created from the Divine love and the Divine wisdom is what is meant by this passage in John:<p>The Word was with God, and the Word was God; all things were made through Him; and the world was made through Him, <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_10.htm">10</a>.<p>God there means the Divine love, and the Word the Divine truth, or the Divine wisdom. That is why the Word is there called the light; light, when referring to God, means the Divine wisdom.'<p>At the end of this speech when I was saying good-bye, gleams of light from the sun there came gliding down through the heavens of the angels and entered their eyes, and through them the dwellings of their minds. Under this enlightenment they applauded my speech, and then escorted me into the courtyard; and my earlier companion took me to the house where I was living, and from there went back up to his own community. </p>

76. First Memorable Relation: <p>One day I was meditating upon the creation of the universe; and this being perceived by the angels above me on the right side, where were some who from time to time meditated and reasoned on this subject, one of them descended and invited me to join them; and coming into the spirit I went with him; and having joined them I was taken to the prince, in whose palace I saw some hundreds assembled, with the prince in the midst. <p>Then one of them said, "We perceived here that you were meditating upon the creation of the universe; and we too have sometimes indulged in like meditation; but we have never been able to reach a conclusion, because there clung to our thoughts the idea of a chaos, as having been the great egg, as it were, out of which each thing and all things in the universe in their order were hatched; whereas we now perceive that so great a universe could not have been so brought forth. Then there also clung to our minds another idea, namely, that all things were created by God out of nothing; but we are now able to see that out of nothing nothing comes. From these two ideas we have never yet been able to extricate our minds, and to see with any degree of clearness how creation was accomplished. Therefore we have called you from the place where you were, that you might set forth your mediation on this subject. "
</p>
<p>
[2] Having heard this I replied, "I will do so." And I said, "I have meditated on this subject for a long time, but to no purpose. But since I have been introduced by the Lord into your world I have perceived how idle it would be to try to form a conclusion about the creation of the universe without first knowing that there are two worlds, one in which angels are, and the other in which men are; and that men through death pass from their world to the other. I then also saw that there are two suns, one from which all spiritual things flow, and the other from which all natural things flow; and that the sun from which all spiritual things flow is nothing but love from Jehovah God, who is in its midst, and that the sun from which all natural things flow is nothing but fire. Having learned these facts, at one time when in a state of enlightenment I was permitted to perceive that the universe was created by Jehovah God by means of the sun in the midst of which He is; and as there can be no love apart from wisdom, that the universe was created by Jehovah God from His love by means of His wisdom. The truth of this is evinced by all things and each thing I have seen in the world where you are, and in the-world where I am in the body.
</p>
<p>
[3] It would take too much space to explain how creation progressed from its primordial state; but when I have been in a state of enlightenment I have perceived that by means of the heat and light from the sun of your world spiritual atmospheres, which are in themselves substantial, were created one from another. As there were three of these atmospheres, and consequently three degrees of them, three heavens were made; one for the angels who are in the highest degree of love and wisdom, a second for those who are in the second degree, and a third for those who are in the lowest degree. But as this spiritual universe cannot exist without a natural universe wherein it can work out its effects and uses, so at the same time a sun was created from which all natural things proceed, and through which in like manner, by means of heat and light, three atmospheres were created, encompassing the three former as a shell its kernel, or as bark its wood; and finally by means of these atmospheres the terraqueous globe was created where men, beasts, fishes, trees, shrubs, and herbs were formed of earthly substances, composed of soil, stones, and minerals.
</p>
<p>
[4] This is a very general outline of creation and its progress. It would require many volumes to explain the particular and most particular things of it; yet all things point to the conclusion that God did not create the universe out of nothing, for as you have said, out of nothing nothing comes, but that He created it by means of the sun of the angelic heaven, which is from His very Esse, and is therefore nothing but love joined with wisdom. That the universe, by which is meant both the spiritual world and the natural world, was created from the Divine love by means of the Divine wisdom is attested and proved by each thing and all things in it; and this, if you will consider these things in their order and connection, you will be able to see clearly in the light that illuminates the perceptions of your understanding. But it must be kept in mind that the love and wisdom which make one in God are not love and wisdom in an abstract sense, but are in Him as substance; for God is the Very, the Only, and thus the primal Substance and Essence, which has Being and Subsistence in itself.
</p>
<p>
[5] That it was from the Divine love and the Divine wisdom that each and all things were created is meant by these words in John: <p>The Word was with God, and God was the Word. All things were made by Him, and the world was made by Him (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_10.htm">10</a>), <p>'God' signifying here the Divine love, and the 'Word' the truth or Divine wisdom; therefore in the same passage the Word is called 'Light', and in relation to God 'Light' means the Divine wisdom." <p>When I had finished and was bidding them adieu, some rays of light from the sun there descended through the angelic heavens into their eyes, and through these into the abodes of their minds; and when thus enlightened they assented to what I had said, and afterwards followed me into the hall; and my former companion took me to the house where he had found me, and from there he reascended to his own society. </p>

76. MEMORABILIA.<p>Five memorabilia illustrating the subject of creation. The first experience. One day I was meditating upon the creation of the universe. This was noticed by angels above me on the right, where dwelt those who sometimes meditated and reasoned on this subject; so one of them came down and invited me to join them, and I, being in the spirit, accompanied him. On my arrival, I was conducted to the court of their prince where I saw some hundreds assembled, and the prince was in their midst. One of them said: "From our place here we perceived that you were meditating upon the creation of the universe. On several occasions we have considered the same subject, but we have not been able to come to any definite conclusion, because our thoughts were obsessed by the idea of a chaos, as of a great egg from which came forth the universe and all its parts in their order. Since, however, we now perceive that so great a universe could not have been so produced, another idea has clung to our minds, that all things were created by God out of nothing; and yet we also see that out of nothing nothing is made. From these two ideas our minds are not yet able to free themselves and perceive, with any degree of clearness, how creation was effected. We have, therefore, called you from the place where you were that you might give us the results of your meditation on the subject."</p>
<p>
[2] On hearing these words I replied: "I will do so;" and I said: "I had long considered this matter without reaching any conclusion; but after I was admitted by the Lord into your world, I perceived it was vain to form any conclusion about the creation of the universe unless it is first known that there are two worlds, one in which the angels are, and the other in which men are; and that after death men pass from their own world into the other world. Then I perceived that there were two suns, from one of which all spiritual things proceed, and from the other, all natural things; and that the Sun, from which all spiritual things proceed, is pure Love from Jehovah God, who is in its midst, and that the sun, from which all natural things proceed, is pure fire. When I learned these things, it was once granted me, in a state of enlightenment, to perceive that the universe was created by Jehovah God by means of the Sun, in the midst of which He is; and since Love cannot exist apart from Wisdom, I saw that the universe was created by Jehovah God from His Love by means of His Wisdom. The truth of this is clearly proved by everything I have seen in the world in which you are, as well as in the world in which I am as to the body.</p>
<p>
[3] However, it would take too long to explain fully how creation proceeded from its beginning; but once, when in a state of enlightenment, I perceived that by means of light and heat from the Sun of your world spiritual atmospheres, which are in themselves substantial, were created one from another. As there are three of these atmospheres, and consequently three degrees of them, three heavens were formed, one for the angels who are in the highest degree of love and wisdom, another for those in the second degree, and a third for those in the lowest degree. As this spiritual universe cannot exist without a natural universe in which to produce its effects and perform its uses, I perceived that at the same time there was created a sun from which all natural things proceed, and that, in a similar manner by means of it, through the medium of its light and heat, three atmospheres were created, encompassing the former as the shell surrounds its kernel or as the bark of a tree surrounds the wood; and that finally, by means of these atmospheres, the terraqueous globe was formed, where are men, beasts and fish, also trees, shrubs and plants growing from earthly substances composed of soil, stones and minerals.</p>
<p>
[4] This, however, is but a most general sketch of creation and its progress, detailed particulars of which would require volumes to explain. But all things point to the conclusion that God did not create the universe out of nothing, for, as you have just remarked, out of nothing nothing is made; but He did so by means of the Sun of the angelic heaven, which is from His own Being, and consequently is pure Love united with Wisdom. That the universe, by which is meant both worlds, the spiritual and the natural, was created from the Divine Love by means of the Divine Wisdom, is clearly proved by everything in it; and if you study those things in their order and connection, you will be able to see them clearly by the light of your own understandings.<p>It has to be borne in mind, however, that Love and Wisdom, which form one in God, are not Love and Wisdom in any abstract sense, but are in Him as a substance, for God is Substance and Essence itself, the only and consequently the first, which is self-existent and self-subsistent.</p>
<p>
[5] That all things in general and in particular were created from the Divine Love and Divine Wisdom is meant by these words in John:<p>"The Word was with God, and the Word was God... All things were made by Him... and the world was made by Him" <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_10.htm">10</a>.<p>In this passage God signifies the Divine Love, and the Word signifies Divine Truth, or Divine Wisdom; for which reason the Word is also called light; and by light, when spoken of God, is meant Divine Wisdom." When I had finished speaking and was preparing to take my leave, tiny rays of light came down through the angelic heavens from the Sun there into their eyes, and through these into the interiors of their minds; and being thus enlightened, they agreed with what I had said. Then they followed me to the entrance hall, and my former companion accompanied me to my house, and thence re-ascended to his own society. </p>

76. PRIMUM MEMORABILE.<p>Quodam die in meditatione de Creatione Universi fui, et quia hoc perceperunt Angeli supra me a latere dextro, ubi erant qui de eadem aliquoties meditati et ratiocinati sunt, quare unus descendit et invitavit me, et factus sum in spiritu, et comitatus sum illum, et postquam intravi, deductus sum ad Principem, in cujus Aula congregatos ad centenos vidi, et Princeps in medio illorum: et tunc unus ex illis dixit, percepimus hic quod meditatus sis de Creatione Universi, et nos in simili meditatione aliquoties fuimus, sed non potuimus concludere, quoniam cogitationibus nostris inhaesit idea de Chao, quod hoc sicut magnum Ovum fuerit, ex quo exclusa fuerunt omnia et singula Universi in suo Ordine; cum tamen nunc percipimus, quod tantum Universum non potuerit ita excludi; tum etiam inhaesit mentibus nostris idea alia, quae erat, quod a Deo omnia creata sint ex nihilo, et tamen nunc percipimus, quod ex nihilo nihil fiat; et ex his duabus ideis Mentes nostrae nondum se potuerunt evolvere, et in aliqua luce videre Creationem quomodo facta est; quapropter evocavimus te e loco ubi eras, ut de illa tuam meditationem expromas.</p>
<p>
[2] His auditis, respondi, expromam; et dixi, de hoc diu meditatus sum, sed in vanum; at postea cum a Domino intromissus sum in vestrum Mundum, percepi quod vanum esset aliquid de Creatione Universi concludere, nisi prius sciatur, quod duo Mundi sint, Unus in quo Angeli sunt, et alter in quo homines, et quod hi per mortem e suo in alterum transcendant; et tunc etiam vidi quod duo Soles essent, unus ex quo omnia Spiritualia profluunt, et alter ex quo omnia Naturalia, et quod Sol, ex quo omnia Spiritualia profluunt, sit purus Amor a Jehovah Deo, Qui in medio ejus est, et quod Sol, ex quo omnia naturalia profluunt, sit purus Ignis. His cognitis, quondam cum in illustratione eram, datum est percipere, quod a Jehovah Deo per Solem, in cujus medio est, Universum creatum sit; et quia Amor non dabilis est nisi una cum Sapientia, quod a Jehovah Deo ex suo Amore per suam Sapientiam Universum creatum sit; quod ita sit, convincunt omnia et singula, quae vidi in Mundo, ubi vos estis, et quae vidi in Mundo, in quo ego corpore sum.</p>
<p>
[3] Quomodo autem a primordio suo progressio Creationis facta est, nimis prolixum est exponere; sed cum in illustratione fui, percepi, quod mediis Luce et Calore ex Sole vestri Mundi creatae sint athmosphaerae spirituales, quae in se sunt substantiales, una ex altera; quae quia tres sunt, et inde tres gradus <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
earum, tres Coeli facti sunt, unum pro Angelis qui in supremo gradu amoris et sapientiae sunt, alterum pro Angelis qui in secundo gradu, et tertium pro Angelis qui in ultimo gradu. Sed quia Universum hoc spirituale non potest existere absque Universo naturali, in quo illud ageret suos effectus et usus, quod simul tunc Sol, ex quo omnia Naturalia procedunt, creatus sit, et per hunc similiter, mediis luce et calore, tres athmosphaerae ambientes priores illas, sicut putamina nucleos, aut philyrae ligna, et tandem per has Orbis terraqueus, ubi homines, bestiae, pisces, tum arbores, frutices et herbae, ex terris quae ex humis, lapidibus et mineris consistunt.</p>
<p>
[4] Ast haec est sciagraphia communissima Creationis et ejus progressionis, at particularia et singularia non possunt exponi, nisi per Volumina librorum; verum omnia concludunt hoc, quod Deus non creaverit Universum ex nihilo, quia, ut dixistis, ex nihilo nihil fit, sed per Solem coeli angelici, qui est ex Esse Ipsius, et inde purus Amor una cum Sapientia: quod Universum, per quod intelligitur uterque Mundus, Spiritualis et Naturalis, ex Divino Amore per Divinam Sapientiam creatum sit, omnia et singula ejus testantur et contestantur, et vos, si illa in ordine et connexu expenditis, ex luce, in qua perceptiones intellectus vestri sunt, potestis clare videre: at tenendum est, quod Amor et Sapientia, quae in Deo unum faciunt, non sint Amor et Sapientia in sensu abstracto, sed in Ipso ut Substantia, nam Deus est ipsa, unica et inde prima Substantia et Essentia, quae in se Est et Subsistit.</p>
<p>
[5] Quod omnia et singula ex Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia creata sint, intelligitur per haec apud Johannem, "Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum, <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
omnia per Ipsum facta sunt, et Mundus per Ipsum factus est," <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">Johannes 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_10.htm">10</a>. Deus ibi significat Divinum Amorem, et Verbum significat Divinum Verum, seu Divinam Sapientiam, quare Verbum ibi appellatur Lux, et per Lucem, ubi <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
de Deo, intelligitur Divina Sapientia. His peractis, cum vale dicerem, micae lucis e Sole ibi per Coelos angelicos delapsae sunt in oculos illorum, et per hos in habitacula mentis illorum, et sic illustrati dictis a me faverunt, et postea in atrium me sequuti sunt, et prior comes ad domum ubi eram, et abinde in Societatem suam reascendit.<p>
