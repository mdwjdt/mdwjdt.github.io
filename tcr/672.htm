672. 凡有正常理智者, 谁不明白, 洗澡时洗脸, 手, 脚, 或四肢, 甚至整个身体, 除了洗去污垢, 使得人的形体显得干净外没有任何效果? 谁不知道施洗并不进入人的灵, 使得它同样干净? 因为小偷, 土匪和强盗也能将身体洗到发白, 但偷, 抢, 盗的性情能由此被洗去吗? 难道不是内在流入外在, 并产生其意愿与觉知的效果, 而不是外在流入内在吗? 后者违背天性, 因为它违反秩序; 而前者符合天性, 因为它符合秩序。 </p>

</h4>
<p>
672. Surely everyone of sound reason is capable of seeing that washing our face, hands, feet, and all our limbs - even washing our whole body in a bathtub - does no more than wash away dirt so that we look clean and properly human to others. Surely everyone can understand that there is no physical act of washing that can reach our spirit and cleanse it as well.
</p>
<p>
 [2] All criminals, robbers, and thieves have the ability to wash themselves until they gleam; but that washing does not wipe away the characteristics that make them criminals, robbers, and thieves.
<p>The inner self flows into the outer self and produces the effects sought by the will and the intellect. The outer self does not flow into the inner self. A flow that goes inward is unnatural, because it goes against the divine design; a flow that goes outward is natural, because it follows the divine design. </p>

672. Can anyone of sound reason fail to see that the washing of the face, hands and feet, or of all the limbs, in fact the washing of the whole body in a bath, has no effect except the washing away of dirt, so that to human view one may appear clean in one's human form? And can anyone fail to understand that no washing enters into a person's spirit and makes that equally clean?</p>
<p>
[2] Every criminal, robber and brigand can wash himself until he shines; but will this do anything to wipe away his crime, robbery and brigandage? To be sure, it is the internal which influences the external and produces the effects of his will and understanding. It is not the external which influences the internal; that is contrary to nature, being contrary to right order. The previous is the natural way, being in accordance with right order. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #672 (Ager, 1970)

<p>
672. What man of sound reason cannot see that the washing of the face, hands, and feet, or of all the limbs, and even the whole body in a bath, does nothing more than wash away the dirt, that men may appear clean in the human form before men? And who cannot understand that no washing enters into man's spirit and renders that equally clean? For any thief, plunderer or robber may wash himself until he shines; but is the disposition to steal, plunder, and rob thereby washed away? Does not the internal flow into the external and work out the effects of its will and understanding, but not the external into the internal? For this latter is contrary to nature, because it is contrary to order; but the former is according to nature, because it is according to order. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #672 (Dick, 1950)
</h4>
<p>
672. Every man of sound reason may see that the washing of the face, hands and feet, and all the limbs, indeed of the whole body in a bath, does nothing more than wash away the dirt, so that those who are washed may appear in their bodily form clean before men. Moreover, every one understands that such washing does not enter into a man's spirit, and render it equally clean. Any villain, plunderer or robber may wash himself till the skin shines; but will that wash away the disposition to villainy, to plundering, and to robbery? The internal flows into the external, and directs the results its own will and understanding produce; but not the external into the internal; for the latter is contrary to nature, because contrary to order, but the former is according to nature, because according to order. </p>

672. Quis homo sanae rationis non videre potest, quod lavatio faciei, manuum et pedum, omniumque artuum, imo totius corporis in balneo, non efficiat aliud, quam quod abluantur sordes, ut coram hominibus in forma humana mundi appareant; et quis non potest intelligere, quod aliqua lavatio non intret in spiritum hominis, et hunc aeque mundum reddat;</p>
<p>
[2] potest enim omnis furcifer, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
praedo et latro, se lavare usque ad nitorem; num sic furciferum, praedonicum et latronicum abstergitur; nonne internum influit in externum, et operatur suae voluntatis et intellectus effectus, non autem externum in internum, hoc enim est contra naturam, quia est contra ordinem, illud autem secundum naturam, quia est secundum ordinem.<p>
