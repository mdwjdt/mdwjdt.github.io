<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>717</b>.从刚才所述可推知，主的全部救赎就在圣餐里面，因为主全在之地，就是祂的全部救赎所在之地。因为就其人性而言，祂是救世主，也是救赎本身。祂全在之地，救赎一样不缺。因为这个缘故，凡配靠近圣体者皆成为祂的救赎。由于救赎意味着从地狱解脱出来，与主联结，并得救（对此，本章将进一步讨论，在救赎一章论述得更充分），所以这些果实被归给人，但达不到主想要的程度（若按祂的圣爱，祂希望将一切归给人），而只达到人能接受的程度。接受者照他接受的程度得到救赎。这些事实证明，主救赎的果效和好处会临到那些配得圣餐的人。</p>

717. The fact that the Lord's redemption is also fully present in the Holy Supper is a direct consequence of what was just stated. Where the Lord is fully present, his redemption is also fully present. In his humanity he is the Redeemer; therefore he is redemption itself. Where he is fully present, no part of redemption can be absent. Therefore all who approach the Holy Supper worthily become his redeemed.
<p>Being redeemed means being liberated from hell, forming a partnership with the Lord, and being saved (see below in this chapter [719-730] and the more extended treatment in the chapter on redemption [114-133]). These then are the fruits that are given to us in the Holy Supper. They are not given us to the full extent that the Lord would like, however. Moved as he is by his divine love, he would prefer to give us all of these gifts [at once]. Instead we are given them in accordance with our own receptivity; however receptive we are, that is how far the process of redemption takes us. This makes it clear that those who go to the Holy Supper worthily come away with effects and fruits of the Lord's redemption. </p>

717. It follows from what has now been said that the whole of the Lord's redemption is present in the Holy Supper; for where the Lord wholly is, there too is the whole of His redemption. For He as regards His Human is the Redeemer, and so also redemption itself. No part of the redemption can be missing, where He wholly is. On this account all those who worthily attend Holy Communion become His redeemed. Because redemption means being freed from hell, linked with the Lord and saved (subjects which will be discussed further on in this chapter, and have been more fully discussed in that on redemption), those benefits are assigned to the person. This happens, not to the extent that the Lord wishes, for His Divine love makes Him wish to assign everything, but to the extent that the person receives them. The person who receives them is redeemed to the degree that he receives them. These facts establish that the effects and benefits of the Lord's redemption come to those who worthily approach the Holy Supper. </p>

717. That the whole of the Lord's redemption is in the holy supper follows from what has already been said, since where the Lord is wholly present there also is His whole redemption; for it is in respect to His Human that He is the Redeemer, and thus also redemption itself. Where He is wholly present no part of redemption can be absent, consequently all who approach the holy communion worthily become His redeemed. And as redemption means deliverance from hell, conjunction with the Lord, and salvation (respecting which see further on in this chapter, and more fully in the chapter on Redemption), so these fruits are ascribed to man, not to the extent that the Lord wills (for from His Divine love He wishes to ascribe all things to man), but to the extent that man receives; and he that receives is redeemed in the degree in which he receives. From all this it is clear that to those who come worthily, the effects and fruits of the Lord's redemption are attained. </p>

717. From what has just been said, it follows that the whole of the Lord's redemption is in the Holy Supper; for where the Lord is wholly present, there also is the whole of His redemption. For He as to the Human is the Redeemer, and consequently He is also redemption itself; and where He is wholly present, nothing of redemption can be absent. On this account, all who worthily approach the Holy Communion become His redeemed. Since redemption means deliverance from hell, conjunction with the Lord, and salvation, subjects which are treated later in this chapter, and more fully in the chapter on Redemption, therefore, those benefits are imparted to man in the Holy Supper; not indeed in the degree that the Lord wills, for from His Divine Love He desires to impart all, but in the degree that man receives; and he who receives is redeemed according to his reception. Hence it is evident that the effects and benefits of the Lord's redemption come to those who worthily approach the Holy Supper. </p>

<p>
717. Quod in Sancta Coena tota Domini Redemptio sit, consequitur ex nunc dictis, nam ubi totus Dominus est, ibi quoque tota Ipsius Redemptio est; Ipse enim quoad Humanum est Redemptor, proinde etiam ipsa Redemptio; non potest quicquam Redemptionis abesse, ubi Ille totus est; quapropter omnes illi, qui digne Sanctam Communionem obeunt, fiunt Redempti Ipsius: et quia per Redemptionem intelliguntur Liberatio ab Inferno, Conjunctio cum Ipso, et Salvatio, de quibus infra in hoc Capite, et plenius in Capite de Redemptione, ideo illi fructus addicantur homini; non vero quantum Dominus vult, quia ex Divino suo Amore vult addicare omnia, sed quantum homo recipit, et qui recipit, ille est redemptus in eo gradu, quo recipit. Ex quibus constat, quod effectus et fructus Redemptionis Domini ad illos, qui digne accedunt, redeant. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
