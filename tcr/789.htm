<p>
789. As for what this church is going to be like, the other prophets gave predictions about it in many passages. I will present just a few here. In Zechariah,
<p>There will be a day, which is known to Jehovah - it will not be day or night, but around the time of evening there will be light. In that day living waters will go forth from Jerusalem, and Jehovah will become king over the whole earth. In that day there will be one Jehovah, and his name will be one. (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_7.htm">Zechariah 14:7-9</a>)
<p>In Joel,
<p>And on that day it will happen that the mountains will drip with new wine and the hills will flow with milk. And Jerusalem shall remain from generation to generation. (<a href="3927/joel_3_18.htm">Joel 3:18-20</a>)
<p>In Jeremiah,
<p>At that time they will call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah, and all the nations will be gathered together to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem. No longer will they go toward the obstinacy of their evil heart. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_3_17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_26.htm">26</a>)
<p>In Isaiah,
<p>Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a peaceful dwelling place, a tabernacle that will not be taken down. Its stakes will never be removed and its ropes will not be broken. (<a href="3927/isaiah_33_20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a>)
</p>
<p>
[2] In these passages, Jerusalem means the holy New Jerusalem, which is described in Revelation 21 and means the new church. Again, in Isaiah,
<p>A branch will come out of the trunk of Jesse. Justice will be his loincloth, and the truth will wrap his thighs. Then the wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard [will lie down] with the goat. The young ox and the young lion and the fatted calf will be together, and a little child will lead them. The bull calf and the bear will graze; their offspring will lie down together. A nursing child will play over a cobra's hole, and a weaned child will reach a hand over the den of a poisonous snake. They will not do evil and they will not defile themselves anywhere on my holy mountain, because the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah. In that day the nations will seek the root of Jesse, who stands as a banner for the peoples, and glory will be his rest. (<a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_5.htm">5-10</a>)
<p>As we all know, these conditions do not yet exist in the churches, least of all in the most recent church. In Jeremiah,
<p>Behold, the days are coming when I will make a new covenant. This will be the covenant. I will put my law inside them. I will write it on their hearts. I will be their God and they will be my people. They will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>)
</p>
<p>
[3] Again, it is a well-known fact that conditions like these have not come about yet in the churches. The reason is that we have not turned to the God who can be seen - the God we "will all know. " Yet he himself is the Word or the law that he will put inside us and write on our heart. In Isaiah,
<p>For Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until its justice goes forth as brightness and its salvation burns like a lamp. You will be called by a new name that the mouth of Jehovah will announce. You will also be a beautiful crown and a royal miter in the hand of your God. Jehovah will be pleased with you, and your land will be married. Behold, your salvation is coming, and his reward is with him. They will call them "a holy people" and "those redeemed by Jehovah. " You will be called a sought-after city, and not a deserted city. [<a href="3927/isaiah_62_1.htm">Isaiah 62:1-4</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_62_11.htm">11-12</a>] </p>

<p>
789. Moreover, the rest of the Prophets have predicted in many passages what this church will be like; only a few will be quoted. In Zechariah:<p>There shall be one day, which is known to Jehovah, neither day nor night, because around eveningtime there shall be light. On that day living waters shall come forth from Jerusalem; and Jehovah shall become king over the whole earth. On that day Jehovah shall be one, and His name one, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_7.htm">Zechariah 14:7-9</a>.<p>In Joel:<p>It will happen on that day that the mountains will drip new wine, the hills will flow with milk; and Jerusalem will stay fixed from and one generation to another, <a href="3927/joel_3_17.htm">Joel 3:17-21</a>.<p>In Jeremiah:<p>At that time they will call Jerusalem Jehovah's throne, and all nations will be gathered to Jerusalem for Jehovah's name's sake, and they will no longer follow the promptings of their evil hearts, <a href="3927/jeremiah_3_17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_26.htm">26</a>.<p>In Isaiah:<p>Let your eyes behold Jerusalem, a tranquil dwelling, a tent which will not be blown away. Its pegs will never be removed, and its ropes will not be pulled up, <a href="3927/isaiah_33_20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] In these passages Jerusalem means the new Holy Jerusalem described in Revelation (chapter 21); and this means the new church. In Isaiah again:<p>A shoot will go forth from the trunk of Jesse, and righteousness will be the girdle around his loins, and truth the belt around his thighs. Therefore the wolf will stay with the lamb, and the leopard with the kid, the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, and a small boy will lead them. The heifer and the bear will feed, their offspring will lie down together. The sucking child will play on the hole of the viper, and the weaned child will thrust his hand on the den of the basilisk. They will not do evil nor corrupt themselves in all the mountain of my holiness. For the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah. It will happen on that day, the nations will seek the root of Jesse, which stands as a signal to the peoples, and peace will be his glory, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_5.htm">5-10</a>.<p>It is well known that such events have not yet happened in the churches, least of all in the last of them. In Jeremiah:<p>Behold, the days are coming when I will strike a new covenant. This is the covenant: I will set my law in their midst, and I will write it on their hearts; and I will become their God and they shall become my people. All shall know me from the least to the greatest of them, <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] It is also well known that these events did not take place in the previous churches. The reason is that they did not approach the visible God, whom all are to know. It is also because He is the Word, that is, the Law, which He will set in their midst and write upon their hearts. In Isaiah:<p>For Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her righteousness goes forth like a beam of light, and her salvation burns like a lamp. You will be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah will utter. And you will be a crown of beauty and a diadem of kingship in the hand of your God. Jehovah will be pleased in you, and your land will be married. Behold, your salvation is coming, behold, his reward is with him; and they will call them the people of holiness, the redeemed of Jehovah, and you will be called a city sought after and not abandoned, <a href="3927/isaiah_62_1.htm">Isaiah 62:1-4</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_62_11.htm">11-12</a>. </p>

<p>
789. Furthermore, the other prophets have made many predictions respecting this church, what its character would be, a few of which shall be cited: In Zechariah: <p>It shall be one day that shall be known to Jehovah, not day nor night, for about the time of evening it shall be light. In that day living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; and Jehovah shall be king over all the earth; in that day shall there be one Jehovah and His name one (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_7.htm">14:7-9</a>) <p>In Joel: <p>And it shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk; and Jerusalem shall abide to generation and generation (<a href="3927/joel_3_17.htm">3:17-21</a>). <p>In Jeremiah: <p>At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, because of the name of Jehovah at Jerusalem; neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart (<a href="3927/jeremiah_3_17.htm">3:17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_26.htm">26</a>). <p>In Isaiah: <p>Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; the stakes thereof shall never be removed, and the cords thereof shall not be broken (<a href="3927/isaiah_33_20.htm">33:20</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] In these passages "Jerusalem" means the new and holy Jerusalem described in the Apocalypse (chap. 21), by which the New Church is meant. Again in Isaiah: <p>There shall go forth a Shoot out of the stem of Jesse and righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins, and truth the girdle of His thigh. Therefore the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the basilisk's den. They shall not do evil nor corrupt themselves in all the mountain of My holiness; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah. In that day it shall come to pass that the nations shall seek the Root of Jesse which standeth for an ensign of the people; and His rest shall be glory (<a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_5.htm">5-10</a>). <p>That such things have not yet taken place in the churches, least of all in the last, is well known. In Jeremiah: <p>Behold the days come, in which I will make a new covenant; and this shall be the covenant, I will put My law in their inward parts, and upon their hearts will I write it, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people; and they shall all know Me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] That this state of things has not existed in the churches heretofore is also known. This was because men did not approach the visible God whom all shall know, because He is the Word or law which He will put in their inward parts and write upon their hearts. Again in Isaiah: <p>For Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth; and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah shall declare; and thou shalt be a crown of beauty and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. Jehovah shall delight in thee, and thy land shall be married. Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with Him. And they shall call them, the people of holiness, the redeemed of Jehovah, and thou shalt be called, a city sought out and not forsaken (<a href="3927/isaiah_62_1.htm">Isaiah 62:1-4</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_62_11.htm">11-12</a>). </p>

<p>
789. The other Prophets have also foretold in many passages the nature of this Church, and a few of these will now be quoted. In Zechariah it is written:<p>"The day shall be one which shall be known to JEHOVAH, not day, nor night: because at evening time it shall be light.... In that day living waters shall go out from Jerusalem... and JEHOVAH shall be King over all the earth: in that day there shall be one JEHOVAH, and His name one" <a href="3927/zechariah_14_7.htm">Zechariah 14:7-9</a>.<p>In Joel:<p>"It shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk... and Jerusalem shall dwell to generation and generation" <a href="3927/joel_3_17.htm">Joel 3:17-21</a>.<p>In Jeremiah:<p>"At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of JEHOVAH, and all nations shall be gathered... on account of (A.V., to) the name of JEHOVAH, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their heart" <a href="3927/jeremiah_3_17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_26.htm">26</a>.<p>In Isaiah:<p>"Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken" <a href="3927/isaiah_33_20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] In these passages by Jerusalem is meant the holy New Jerusalem described in <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21</a>, by which is meant the New Church. Again in Isaiah:<p>"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse... and righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins, and truth (A.V., faithfulness) the girdle of His reins. The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together... And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of JEHOVAH... And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and His rest shall be glorious" <a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">11:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_5.htm">5-10</a>.<p>It is well known that such things have not yet been seen in the Churches, and least of all in the last Church.<p>In Jeremiah:<p>"Behold, the days come... that I will make a new covenant... and this shall be the covenant... I will put my law in the midst of them (A.V., in their inward parts), and write it on their heart; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people... they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them" <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] It is also known that these things have not hitherto taken place in the Churches, because they did not approach a visible God, whom all men shall know, and who is Himself the Word, or the Law which He will put in the midst of them, and write on their heart.<p>In Isaiah:<p>"For Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth... and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of JEHOVAH shall name. Thou shalt also be a crown of glory... and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God... JEHOVAH shall delight (A.V., delighteth) in thee, and thy land shall be married... Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, His reward is with Him... and they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of JEHOVAH: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken." <a href="3927/isaiah_62_1.htm">Isaiah 62</a> </p>

"Oculi tui videant Hierosolymam, Habitaculum tranquillum, Tabernaculum, quod non dissipabitur; non removebuntur clavi ejus in perpetuum, et funes ejus non avellentur," <a href="3927/isaiah_33_20.htm">Esajas 33:20</a>.</p>

[2] in his locis per Hierosolymam intelligitur Sancta Hierosolyma nova, descripta in <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Apocalypsi 21</a>, per quam intelligitur Nova Ecclesia; iterum apud Esajam, Exibit Virga de trunco Jishaji, et erit Justitia cingulum lumborum Ipsius, et Veritas cingulum feminum ejus; quare commorabitur lupus cum agno, et pardus cum haedo, vitulus et leo juvenis et saginatum una, puerque parvus ducet eos: juvenca et ursus pascent, una cubabunt foetus eorum; quin ludet sugens super foramine viperae, et super speluncam basilisci ablactatus manum suam impellet; non facient malum, neque corrumpent se in toto monte Sanctitatis meae; quia plena erit terra scientia Jehovae. Fiet in die illo, Radicem Jishaji, quae stans in signum populorum, Gentes quaerent, et erit quies Ipsius gloria, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">11:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_5.htm">5-10</a>; quod talia nondum in Ecclesiis, et minus in ultima, exstiterint, notum est. Apud Jeremiam, "Ecce dies venientes, quibus pangam foedus novum, et hoc erit foedus; dabo legem meam in medio eorum, et super cor scribam illam, eroque illis in Deum, et illi erunt Mihi in populum, omnes cognoscent Me a minimo eorum usque ad maximum eorum," <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_31.htm">31:31-34</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_3.htm">Apocalypsis 21:3</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] quod haec in Ecclesiis antehac non data sint, etiam notum est; causa fuit quia non adiverunt Deum visibilem, quem omnes cognoscent, et quia Ipse est Verbum, seu Lex, quam ponet in medio eorum, et super cor scribet illam. Apud Esaiam, "Propter Hierosolymam non quiescam, usque dum exeat sicut splendor justitia ejus, ac salus ejus sicut lampas ardeat; et vocabitur tibi nomen novum, quod os Jehovae enuntiabit, et eris CORONA DECORIS et CIDARIS REGNI in manu Dei tui: beneplacebit Jehovah in te, et terra tua MARITABITUR. Ecce Salus tua veniet, ecce Merces Ejus cum Ipso, et vocabunt illos, populus sanctitatis, redempti Jehovae, et tu vocaberis quaesita Urbs, et non deserta."
