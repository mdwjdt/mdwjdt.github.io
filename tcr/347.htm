<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>347</b>.至于信的形成，它是通过人靠近主，从圣言学习真理并照之生活而实现的。首先，信是通过人靠近主而形成的，因为系正信的信，也就是得救之信来自主，直接指向主。主对他的门徒所说的话清楚表明信来自主：<br />你们要在我里面，我也在你们里面，离了我，你们就不能做什么。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.4.htm">约翰福音15:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.5.htm">5</a>）<br />它是直接指向主的信，这一点从前面（337，338节）引用的大量经文明显看出来，大意是，人必须信子。由于信来自主、并且直接指向主，故可以说，主就是信本身，因为信的生命和本质都在主里面，因而出于祂。<br />其次，信是通过人从圣言学习真理而形成的，因为就其本质而言，信就是真理，信的一切成分都是真理。因此，信无非是将光投射在人的心智中的真理的集合。因为真理不但教导人当有宗教信仰，还教导他当信谁，信什么。真理必取自圣言，因为它包含有助于救恩的一切真理；它们是有功效的，因为它们由主所赐，并因此被铭刻在整个天使天堂。所以，当人从圣言学习真理时，他就会不知不觉地进入与天使的交流和联结中。缺乏真理的信就象没有谷核的种子，碾碎之后只能得到麸皮；出于真理的信则象有用的种子，会碾出面粉来。总之，信的本质就是真理；若真理不居于并构成信，这信只不过象刺耳的哨声；但若真理居于并构成信，这信则象能带来拯救的喜讯。<br />再次，信是通过人照真理生活而形成的，因为属灵的生活就是遵循真理的生活，真理在实现于行为之前并非真的活了起来。与行为脱节的真理仅属于人的思维；若不被意愿接受，它们只是站在人的门外，因此并不在他里面。因为意愿才是人自己，思维则照着它与意愿结合的程度和性质而成为人。人若学习真理却不将其付诸实践，就象有人把种子撒在田里，却不耙地；然后雨水将种子泡胀，以致它们变成空壳。而人若学习真理并将其付诸实践，则象有人播下种子，并进行耕作；然后雨水使种子长出庄稼，它们成为食物的有用源头。主说：<br />你们既知道这事，若是去行就有福了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.17.htm">约翰福音13:17</a>）<br /><br />撒在好地上的，就是人听道明白了，后来结实。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.23.htm">马太福音13:23</a>）<br />还有：<br />凡听见我这话就去行的，好比一个聪明人，把房子盖在磐石上。凡听见我这话不去行的，好比一个无知的人，把房子盖在沙土上。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.24.htm">马太福音7:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.26.htm">26</a>）<br />主的话全都是真理。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #347 </h4>
<p>
347. 至於信的形成, 是這樣發生的:人接近主, 從聖言中學真理, 是憑藉所學真理去生活。
<p>首先, 人接近主而形成信。因為真正的信, 就是帶來拯救的信, 是從主而來的信, 是針對主的信。主對祂門徒們所講的話可清楚說明, 信來自於主:你們要在我裡面, 我也在你們裡面, 離了我, 你們就不能做什麼(<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">約翰福音15:4-5</a>)。至於真正的信是針對主的信, 請參看之前引述的大量經文(<a href="337.htm">337-338</a>節), 申明了人必須信子。由於信來自於主,並且是對主的信, 可以說, 主就是信之本, 因為信的生命和本質都在主裡面, 因而源自於主。
<p>[2]第二, 從聖言學習真理, 從而形成信。因為從本質上看, 信是真理。構成信的一切成分都是真理。信並非別的什麼, 只是真理的積聚並投射光芒於人的思想中。因為真理教導的不僅是人應當相信, 而且還教導當信誰,當信什麼。必須從聖言中獲取真理, 因為聖言包含了一切通向拯救的真理; 並且這些真理產生果效, 因為它們由主所賜, 並印刻于整個天人的天國。結果, 當我們從聖言中學習真理時, 便不知不覺地與天人發生聯繫。
<p>信若缺乏真理, 就像麥種缺乏穎果(麥殼裡的果實), 當碾磨時, 只產生麩皮。由真理構成的信則如果豐收的好種子, 能磨出好麵粉來。簡言之, 信的要素就是真理。倘若信不包含真理, 那僅僅像無聊的口哨之聲。但是, 當包含真理時, 就成了引向拯救的召喚之聲。
<p>[3]第三, 憑藉所學真理去生活, 來形成信。因為屬靈的生活就是遵循真理的生活。除非轉變成現實的行為, 真理就不是活的真理。與行為脫節的真理只是人的想法而已; 如果不被人的意志所接受, 真理就只會站在人的門外,無法與人同住。因為人的意志是人的本身, 而人(通過思考與認知)的想法僅僅將意志與自身相連而已, 思考與認知的性質如何取決於這種連接的程度。
<p>人學真理卻不按真理而活, 就如同人撒種在田地的表面, 而不是在地裡, 以致于雨水浸泡而膨脹, 最後就剩下空殼。然而人若學真理並踐行出來, 就像人耕地後再將種子撒在土裡, 然後雨水潤澤,令種子長成莊稼, 成為食物的來源。主說:"你們既知道這事, 若是去行就有福了"(<a href="3927/john_13_17.htm">約翰福音13:17</a>)。在另一處:"撒在好地上的, 就是人聽道明白了, 後來結實"(<a href="3927/matthew_13_23.htm">馬太福音13:23</a>)。還有:"凡聽見我這話就去行的, 好比一個聰明人, 把房子蓋在磐石上。凡聽見我這話不去行的, 好比一個無知的人, 把房子蓋在沙土上"(<a href="3927/matthew_7_24.htm">馬太福音7:24</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_7_26.htm">26</a>)。主的一切話皆為真理。 </p>

347. As for the manner in which faith is formed, this happens by our turning to the Lord, learning truths from the Word, and living by those truths.
<p>First of all, faith is formed by our turning to the Lord, because faith that is real, that is, faith that brings salvation, is faith from the Lord and faith in the Lord. It is clear from the Lord's words to the disciples that faith is from him: "Live in me and I [shall live] in you, because without me you cannot do anything" (<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>). As for faith being a faith in the Lord, see the many passages cited above, 337-338, which show that we have to believe in the Son. Given that faith is faith from the Lord and faith in the Lord, you could say that the Lord is faith itself, for its life and essence exist in the Lord and come from him.
</p>
<p>
[2] Second, faith is formed by our learning truths from the Word, because faith in its essence is truth. All the elements that constitute faith are truths. Faith, then, is nothing but an array of truths shining in our mind. Truths teach not only that we need to have beliefs but also in whom to believe and what to believe.
<p>Truths need to be taken from the Word, because all the truths that make a contribution to our salvation are there. These truths are genuinely effective because they have been given by the Lord and have been engraved on the entire angelic heaven. As a result, when we learn truths from the Word, without our knowing it we come into contact and association with angels.
<p>Faith without truths is like a seed without a kernel. If you grind it, you get nothing but chaff. Faith made of truths is like a seed from the harvest. If you grind it, you get flour. To put it briefly, truths are essential components of faith. If faith does not contain truths, it is merely like the sound of idle whistling. When faith contains truths, it is like the sound of the call to our salvation.
</p>
<p>
[3] Third, faith is formed by our living by those truths, because a spiritual life is a life that follows truths. Truths are not actually alive before they exist in actions. Truths dissociated from actions are just thoughts. If they do not become part of our will, they are not inside us; they are only on our threshold. Our will is our true self. Our thinking reflects our true self only to the extent that it is connected to our will.
<p>People who learn truths and do not live by them are like people who scatter seeds on top of a field but do not plow them under - the seeds become swollen by the rain and split into empty husks. People who learn truths and do them are like people who sow and plow the seeds under. With the benefit of rain, the seeds then grow into a harvest and become useful for nutrition. The Lord says, "If you know these things, you are happy if you do them" (<a href="3927/john_13_17.htm">John 13:17</a>). And elsewhere, "Those who received seed in good ground are people who hear the Word and pay attention to it, and therefore bear fruit and become productive" (<a href="3927/matthew_13_23.htm">Matthew 13:23</a>). Also, "Everyone who hears my words and does them I will compare to a prudent man who built his house on a rock. But everyone who hears my words and does not do them will be compared to a foolish man who built his house on sand" (<a href="3927/matthew_7_24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_7_26.htm">26</a>). All the words of the Lord are truths. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #347 (Chadwick, 1988)
</h4>
<p>
347. As for the formation of faith, this takes place by a person approaching the Lord, learning truths from the Word, and living by them. First: faith is formed by a person approaching the Lord, because faith which is real faith, that is, the faith which saves, is from the Lord and directed to the Lord. The Lord's words to His disciples show plainly that it comes from the Lord:<p>Remain in me, and I in you, because without me you can do nothing, <a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>.<p>It is plain that it is faith directed to the Lord from the numerous passages which have been cited (337-338), stating that one must believe in the Son. Now since faith is from the Lord and directed to the Lord, it can be said that the Lord is faith itself, for its life and essence are in the Lord, and so come from Him.</p>
<p>
[2] Secondly: the reason why faith is formed by a person learning truths from the Word is that faith essentially is truth; for all the ingredients of faith are truths. Thus faith is nothing but a collection of truths casting light in a person's mind. For truths teach not only that one should believe, but in whom one should believe and what one should believe. Truths must be taken from the Word, because it contains all the truths which lead to salvation; and they are effective because they have been given by the Lord, and are as a result imprinted upon the whole heaven of the angels. When therefore a person goes on to learn truths from the Word, he comes into communion and association with angels, without being aware of it. Faith devoid of truths is like seed devoid of kernel, which if milled produces only bran. But faith derived from truths is like good seed, which if milled produces flour. In short, the essentials of faith are truths; if these are not contained in it and compose it, faith is no more than the sound of a whistle; but when truths are contained in and compose faith, then it is the sound of something that brings salvation.</p>
<p>
[3] Thirdly: faith is formed by a person living by truths, because spiritual life is living in accordance with truths, and truths do not really come alive until they are realised in deeds. Truths unconnected with deeds belong merely to a person's thinking; if they are not also accepted by the will, they merely stand at a person's door and so are not within him. For the will is the person himself, and thought is a person to the extent that it joins the will to itself, and the nature of thought is determined by this joining. A person who learns truths without putting them into practice is like someone scattering seeds over a field and not harrowing it; then the rain makes the seeds swell so that they become empty husks. But a person who learns truths and puts them into practice is like someone who sows seed and ploughs the seed in; then the rain makes the seeds grow into a crop, and they become a useful source of food. The Lord says:<p>If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them, <a href="3927/john_13_17.htm">John 13:17</a>.<p>and in another passage:<p>The person who sows on good ground is the one who hears the Word and pays attention to it, so that he brings forth and produces fruit, <a href="3927/matthew_13_23.htm">Matthew 13:23</a>.<p>Also:<p>Everyone who hears my words and acts upon them, I will compare to a prudent man, who built his house upon a rock; but everyone who hears my words and does not act upon them will be compared to a foolish man who built his house upon sand, <a href="3927/matthew_7_24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_7_26.htm">26</a>.<p>The Lord's words are all of them truths. </p>

<p>
347. As to the formation of faith: it is effected by man's going to the Lord, learning truths from the Word, and living according to them. First: Faith is formed by man's going to the Lord, because faith that is faith, or that is a saving faith, is from the Lord and in the Lord. That it is from the Lord is evident from His words to His disciples: <p>Abide in Me, and I in you for apart from Me, ye can do nothing (<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4, 5</a>). <p>That it is faith in the Lord, is evident from the passages presented in abundance (n. <a href="337.htm">337, 338</a>), to the effect that men ought to believe in the Son. Since then faith is from the Lord and in the Lord, it may be said that the Lord is faith itself, for its life and essence are in Him, and thus from Him.
</p>
<p>
[2] Secondly: Faith is formed by man's learning truths from the Word, because faith in its essence is truth; for all things that enter into faith are truths; consequently faith is nothing but a complex of truths shining in the mind of man; for truths teach not only that man ought to believe, but also in whom he ought to believe, and what he ought to believe. Truths ought to be taken from the Word, because all truths that conduce to salvation are in the Word, and there is efficacy in them because they are given by the Lord, and are therefore inscribed on the whole angelic heaven; consequently when man learns truths from the Word, he comes into communion and consociation with angels beyond what he knows. Faith destitute of truths like grain without inner substance, which when ground yields nothing but bran; while faith from truths is like useful grain, which when ground yields flour. In a word, the essentials of faith are truths; and if truths do not reside in and constitute the faith, it is only like the shrill sound of a whistle; but when they do reside in and constitute it, faith is like a voice of glad tidings.
</p>
<p>
[3] Thirdly: Faith is formed by man's living according to truths, because spiritual life is life according to truths, and truths do not actually live until they are in deeds. Truths abstracted from deeds are merely matters of thought, and unless they become of the will also, are only in the entrance to the man, and thus are not inwardly in him; for the will is the man himself, and the thought is so far the man, in quantity and quality, as it adjoins the will to itself. He who learns truths and does not practice them, is like one who sows seed in a field and does not harrow it in; and consequently the seed becomes swollen by the rain and is spoiled. But he who learns truths and practises them, is like one who sows the seed and covers it, and the rain causes it to grow to a crop and to be of use for food. The Lord says: <p>If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them (<a href="3927/john_13_17.htm">John 13:17</a>) <p>And again: <p>He that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the Word and giveth heed; who also beareth fruit and bringeth forth (<a href="3927/matthew_13_23.htm">Matthew 13:23</a>); <p>also: <p>Everyone that heareth these My words, and doth them, I will liken him unto a prudent man, who built his house upon a rock. And everyone that heareth these My words and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand (<a href="3927/matthew_7_24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_7_26.htm">26</a>). <p>All words of the Lord are truths. </p>

<p>
347. Faith is formed in man by approaching the Lord, learning truths from the Word, and living according to them. First, faith is formed by man's approaching the Lord; because faith, properly so-called, and thus faith that leads to salvation, is from the Lord and in the Lord. That it is from the Lord, is evident from His words to the disciples:<p>"Abide in me, and I in you... for without me ye can do nothing" <a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>.<p>That it is faith in the Lord, is evident from the numerous passages quoted above in <a href="337.htm">337-338</a>, to the effect that a man ought to believe in the Son. Now, since faith is from the Lord and in the Lord, it may be said that the Lord is faith itself; for its life and essence are in Him, and consequently from Him.</p>
<p>
[2] Secondly, faith is formed by man's learning truths from the Word; for faith in its essence is truth, because all things which enter into faith are truths. Faith, therefore, is nothing but a complex of truths shining in the human mind; for truths teach not only that we ought to believe, but also in whom we ought to believe, and what we ought to believe. Truths must be taken from the Word, because all truths leading to salvation are contained therein; and they are effective, because they are given by the Lord, and are consequently inscribed on the whole angelic heaven; so that when a man learns truths from the Word, he enters into closer communion and consociation with angels than he realizes. Faith without truths is like seed without kernel, which when ground yields nothing but bran; whereas faith formed of truths is like fruitful seed, yielding flour when ground. In a word, the essentials of faith are truths; and if these do not enter into it and constitute it, faith is but a voice whistling in its sound; but if they do enter into it and constitute it, faith is like a voice bearing tidings of salvation.</p>
<p>
[3] Thirdly, faith is formed by man's living according to truths; because spiritual life is a life according to truths, and truths do not really live until they are ultimated in deeds. Truths without deeds are matters of thought only; and, if they do not also become matters of the will, they are only at the entrance into man, and thus are not inwardly in him. The will is the man himself, and thought is the man only in the degree and quality in which it enters into conjunction with the will. He who learns truths, and does not do them, is like one who scatters seed in a field, and does not harrow it in; with the result that the seed becomes swollen with the rain and worthless. He, however, who learns truths and does them, is like one who sows his seed and harrows it in. Then the seed, quickened by the rain, grows up into a good crop, and becomes of use for food. The Lord says:<p>"If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them" <a href="3927/john_13_17.htm">John 13:17</a>;<p>and in another place:<p>"But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the Word, and attendeth to it (A.V., understandeth it); which also beareth fruit, and doeth (A.V., bringeth forth). <a href="3927/matthew_13_23.htm">Matthew 13:23</a>;<p>and again:<p>"Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock... And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand" <a href="3927/matthew_7_24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_7_26.htm">26</a>.<p>The words of the Lord are all truths. </p>
