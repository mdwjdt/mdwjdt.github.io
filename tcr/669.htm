669. 这两项圣礼, 即洗礼与圣餐, 在基督教会就象国王王冠上的两颗宝石; 但若不知道它们的作用, 则只不过是权杖上的两个乌木形状。 基督教会的这两项圣礼, 还好比皇帝礼服上的两颗红宝石或红榴石, 但若不知道它们的作用, 则象斗篷上的两个玛瑙或水晶。 若不通过灵义揭示两项圣礼的作用, 关于它们只有零散的猜测, 如同占星家的推测, 甚至象古代根据鸟的内脏或飞行占卜之人的猜想。 这两项圣礼的作用好比一个圣殿由于年代久远而沉入地下, 被周遭的垃圾埋没, 直至殿顶, 老老少少皆在上面行走, 或乘马车, 骑马行在其上, 殊不知, 他们脚下藏着一座圣殿, 里面有金香坛, 四围的墙都是镶银的, 并饰有宝石。 这些宝藏只有通过灵义才能被挖掘出来, 重见天日, 如今这灵义为了新教会被揭示出来, 以便它能被用于对主的敬拜。 同样, 这些圣礼好比两层的圣殿, 一层在下, 另一层在上。 在低层宣讲关于主再来, 重生, 从而在祂引导下的救恩的福音; 在祭坛附近, 有一条从圣殿低层升往高层的小路, 这里就是主持圣餐仪式的地方, 有一条通道由此通往天堂, 主在此接受升上来的人。 它们又好比会幕, 进去后会看到一张桌子, 上面整齐摆放着陈设饼, 还有焚香的金坛, 点亮的灯台就在这些事物当中, 藉着烛光可看到所有这些东西。 最后, 对于那些允许自己被启示的人, 通往至圣所的幔子是打开的, 此处摆放的不是从前存放十诫的约柜, 而是圣言, 它就在有金基路伯的施恩座上。 这些事物是两项圣礼及其作用的象征。 </p>

669. In Christianity the two sacraments, baptism and the Holy Supper, are actually like two royal insignia on a monarch's scepter. If we do not know what function these sacraments perform, however, they seem to us like two figures carved in ebony on someone's walking stick.
<p>In Christianity the two sacraments can also be compared to two rubies or precious garnets on an emperor's robe. If we do not know what function they perform, however, they seem to us like a pair of cheap carnelians or pieces of cut glass on someone's overcoat.
<p>If the functions of the two sacraments were not revealed through the spiritual meaning, guesses about them would spread, but those guesses would have no more value than the pronouncements of people who read the stars or people in ancient times who read omens in the flight of birds or in entrails.
<p>The functions of the two sacraments can be compared to a church building that because of its extreme age has sunk into the ground; even the roof is completely covered with debris. People young and old walk or ride in carriages or ride horses over it without any idea that hidden underfoot there is a beautiful church with altars of gold, interior walls of silver, and decorations of precious stones. The only way to dig these treasures up and bring them to light is through the spiritual meaning, which is being disclosed today for the new church and its worship of the Lord.
<p>The sacraments can be compared to two temples, one of which is built on top of the other. In the lower temple someone is preaching the good news of the Lord's new coming, and also the good news that we are regenerated and saved by the Lord. From this temple, around its altar, there is a way to go up to the higher temple. There the Holy Supper is being celebrated and there is a passageway to heaven where the Lord is welcoming us.
<p>The sacraments can also be compared to a tabernacle. After we enter it a table appears on which the showbread has been carefully arranged. That tabernacle also contains a golden incense altar, and in the middle, a lampstand with its lamps lit, allowing all these things to come into view. Eventually, if we allow ourselves to be enlightened, the veil to the most holy place opens, where in place of the ark that held the Ten Commandments, the Word is kept. Above it there is a mercy seat, protected by angel guardians that are made of gold.
<p>These are representations of the two sacraments and their functions. </p>

669. The two sacraments, baptism and the Holy Supper, are in the Christian church like two ornaments on a king's sceptre; if their purpose were not known, they would be merely two ebony shapes on a staff. Those two sacraments in the Christian church can also be compared with two rubies or carbuncles on an emperor's mantle; if their purpose were not known, they would be like two cornelians or crystals on some cloak. But for the revelation of the purposes of those two sacraments by means of the spiritual sense, there would only be guesses about them scattered around, like those offered by astrologers, or rather those which in antiquity were offered by men who drew auguries from the flight of birds or from entrails.<p>The purposes of those two sacraments can be compared to a church, which is so old it has sunk into the ground, and now lies surrounded by ruins reaching to its roof, so that young men and old walk upon it, ride in carriages or on horseback across it, with no idea that such a church lies hidden beneath their feet, containing altars of gold, walls covered inside in silver and ornaments made of precious stones; and these cannot be dug up and brought to light, except by means of the spiritual sense, which has at the present time been revealed for the new church, so that it can be used in the worship of the Lord.</p>
<p>
[2] Those sacraments can also be compared to a double church, in which there is one below and another above. In the lower one the good news is preached about the Lord's coming anew, and also about regeneration and so salvation under His guidance. From this church a path around the altar leads up to the upper church, where the Holy Supper is celebrated; and from there a passage exists to heaven, where the Lord receives those who come.<p>They can also be compared to the Tabernacle, in which on passing through the entrance a table is seen, on which the loaves of the Presence are arranged in order, and also a golden altar for incense, and in the midst a lamp-stand with lamps burning to make all the rest visible. Finally, for those who allow themselves to be enlightened, the veil to the holy of holies is drawn back, where instead of the Ark containing the Ten Commandments the Word is laid up, and set above it the Mercy-seat with cherubs made of gold. These are representations of those two sacraments together with their purposes. </p>

669. The two sacraments, baptism and the holy supper, are in the Christian church like two gems in the scepter of a king; but if their uses are unknown are merely like two figures of ebony on a staff. These two sacraments in the Christian church may also be likened to two rubies or carbuncles on the robe of an emperor, but if their uses are unknown they are like two carnelians or crystals on a cloak. Without a revelation by means of the spiritual sense of the uses of these two sacraments, there would be nothing but scattered conjectures about them, like the conjectures of those who practice divination by the stars, or even of those who in old times drew auguries from entrails or the flight of birds. The uses of these two sacraments may be likened to a temple, which by reason of its antiquity has sunk into the ground, and lies buried in the surrounding rubbish even to the roof, over which old and young walk and ride in carriages or on horses, not knowing that such a temple is hidden beneath their feet, in which are altars of gold, walls inlaid with silver, and decorations of precious stones. And these treasures can be dug up and brought to light only by means of the spiritual sense, which is now disclosed for the New Church, for its use in the worship of the Lord. Again, these sacraments may be likened to a double temple, one below, the other above. In the lower one the gospel of the Lord's new coming and of regeneration and consequent salvation by Him is preached; and from this temple, near the altar, there is a way of ascent to the higher temple, where the holy supper is celebrated; and from it is the passage into heaven, where those ascending are received by the Lord. Again, they may be likened to a tabernacle, in which after entering there are seen the table on which the bread of faces is arranged in its order, also the golden altar for incense, and between these the candlestick with its lighted lamps, by which all these things are made visible; and at length, for those who suffer themselves to be illuminated, the veil is opened to the holy of holies, where, instead of the ark, which formerly contained the Decalogue, the Word is placed, over which is the mercy seat with the golden cherubs. These things are representations of the two sacraments and their uses. </p>

669. The two sacraments, Baptism and the Holy Supper, are in the Christian Church like two jewels in the sceptre of a king; and if their uses are not known, they are only like two figures of ebony carved on a staff. They may also be compared to two rubies or garnets on the cloak of an emperor; but if their uses are not known, they are only like two cornelians or crystals on any gown. Unless the uses of those two sacraments were revealed by means of the spiritual sense, there would be promulgated various conjectures about them, such as are formed by those who practice divination by the stars, or indeed such as prevailed with those whose auguries were determined by the flight of birds or the entrails of sacrificial victims. Their uses may be compared to a temple which from age has sunk into the ground and lies buried in the surrounding ruins even to its roof; and over it both young and old walk, drive in carriages and ride on horseback, unaware that beneath their feet is hidden such a temple with altars of gold, walls of silver and decorations of precious stones. These things cannot be dug up and brought to light except by means of the spiritual sense, which at this day has been disclosed for the New Church, for the sake of its use in the worship of the Lord.<p>Those sacraments may also be compared to a temple in duplicate, one temple above the other, in the lower of which is preached the gospel of the Lord's new coming, and also of regeneration and consequent salvation by Him. From this temple, circling upwards from the altar, is an ascent to the upper temple, where the Holy Supper is celebrated; and thence is a passage into heaven, where the worshipers are received by the Lord. They may also be compared to a tabernacle, in which, behind the entrance, appears the table on which the shew-bread is placed in order; where there is also the golden altar for incense, and in the midst the candlestick with lighted lamps, by which all these things come into view; and finally, for those who allow themselves to be enlightened, the veil is opened to the Holy of Holies, where, instead of the ark in which the Decalogue had reposed, the Word is placed over which is the mercy-seat with the golden cherubim. These things are representations of those two sacraments with their uses. </p>

669. Duo Sacramenta, Baptismus et Sancta Coena, sunt in Ecclesia Christiana sicut duo Clenodia in Sceptro Regis, quorum usus si nesciuntur, sunt modo sicut duae formae ex ebeno in scipione. Duo illa Sacramenta in Ecclesia Christiana comparari etiam possunt cum duobus Rubinis seu Carbunculis in Chlamyde Imperatoris, quorum usus si nesciuntur, sunt sicut duo carneoli aut crystalli in aliqua toga. Absque Usibus duorum illorum Sacramentorum per Sensum spiritualem revelatis, spargerentur modo de illis conjecturae, quales sunt apud illos qui ex Astris divinant, imo quales fuerunt apud illos olim, qui ex avium volatu aut ab extis augurati sunt. Usus duorum illorum Sacramentorum comparari possunt Templo, quod ex vetustate in terram subsiderat, et usque ad tectum ruinis circum obsitum jacet, super quo juvenes et senes gradiuntur, curribus vehuntur, et equitant, nescientes quod tale Templum sit sub pedibus et absconditum, in quo sunt Altaria ex auro, parietes intus ex argento, et decoramenta ex lapide pretioso, quae non effodi et in lucem expromi possunt, nisi per sensum spiritualem, qui detectus est hodie pro Nova Ecclesia, propter usum in Cultu Domini.</p>
<p>
[2] Sacramenta illa etiam comparari possunt duplicato Templo, quorum unum est infra, alterum supra, et in quorum inferiori praedicatur Evangelium de Novo Adventu Domini, et quoque de Regeneratione et inde salvatione ab Ipso; ex hoc Templo circa Altare est ascensus in Templum superius, in quo Sancta Coena celebratur, et inde est transitus in Coelum, ubi Dominus illos excipit. Comparari etiam possunt Tabernaculo, in quo post introitum apparet Mensa, super qua in suo ordine dispositi sunt panes facierum, et quoque Altare aureum pro suffitu, et in medio Candelabrum cum lucernis accensis, ex quibus omnia illa in conspectum veniunt; et tandem pro illis qui illuminari se patiuntur, aperitur Velum ad Sanctum sanctorum, ubi loco Arcae, in qua fuerat Decalogus, repositum est Verbum, supra quod datum est Propitiatorium cum Cherubis ex Auro. Haec sunt Repraesentationes duorum illorum Sacramentorum cum Usibus illorum. </p>
