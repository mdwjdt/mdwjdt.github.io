<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>217</b>.（1）圣言字义中的真理由形成新耶路撒冷根基的各样宝石（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.17.htm">启示录21:17</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.21.htm">21</a>）来表示。前面提到（209节），灵界和尘世一样，也有各样宝石，其属灵源头就是圣言字义中的真理。这看似难以置信，却千真万确。这就是为何圣言中常常提及宝石的原因；这也是为何就属灵之义而言，宝石表示真理的原因。由此可知，建造新耶路撒冷城墙根基的各样“宝石”表示新教会的教义真理，因为“新耶路撒冷”表示源于圣言的教义方面的新教会。故它的“城墙”和城墙的“根基”无非表示圣言的外层，也就是字义。教义通过字义存在，而教会凭教义存在。圣言的外层就像围住并保护一座城的城墙及其根基。关于新耶路撒冷及其根基，我们在启示录中读到：<br />天使量了新耶路撒冷城墙，按着人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸，共有一百四十四肘。城墙有十二根基，是用各样宝石修饰的：第一根基是碧玉，第二是蓝宝石，第三是绿玛瑙，第四是绿宝石，第五是红玛瑙，第六是红宝石，第七是黄璧玺，第八是水苍玉，第九是红璧玺，第十是翡翠，第十一是紫玛瑙，第十二是紫晶。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.14.htm">启示录21:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.17.htm">17</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.20.htm">20</a>）<br />这城墙之所以有十二根基，并且这十二根基由同样多种宝石形成，是因为数字“十二”表示源于良善的真理的全部，因而在此表示教义的全部。这段经文及该章上下文在我的《破解启示录》一书有详细解释，并通过先知书中的相关经文得以证实。</p>

217. (1)(<a href="3927/revelation_21_17.htm">啟示錄21:17-21</a>)中構建新耶路撒冷城根基的寶石表示聖言文字意義的真理。
<p>上面<a href="209.htm">209</a>節中, 我曾說過, 如同在物質世界那樣, 心靈世界中也能發現寶石, 它們屬靈的源頭就是聖言文字意義的真理。這看起來不可思議, 但千真萬確。這就是聖言中常常提到寶石的原因; 就靈意而言, 寶石也因此表示真理的意思。由此得出, 圍繞新耶路撒冷的城牆之根基由"寶石"構成, 表示新教會教義之真理, 因為"新耶路撒冷"表示新教會——關於教義(源自聖言的教義)方面, 因此她的城"牆"和城牆的"根基"除了表示聖言的外在部分(也就是聖言的文字意義)之外, 別無它意。因為, 正是由文字意義, 教義得以存立; 藉著教義, 教會得以存立。聖言的外在部分正如城牆連同根基, 圍合併保護著一座城。關於新耶路撒冷及其根基, 我們在『啟示錄』中讀到:
<p>(天人)量了新耶路撒冷城牆, 按著人的尺寸, 就是天人的尺寸, 共有一百四十四肘。城牆有十二根基, 是用各樣寶石修飾的:第一根基是碧玉, 第二是藍寶石, 第三是綠瑪瑙, 第四是綠寶石, 第五是紅瑪瑙, 第六是紅寶石, 第七是黃璧璽, 第八是水蒼玉, 第九是紅璧璽, 第十是翡翠, 第十一是紫瑪瑙, 第十二是紫晶(<a href="3927/revelation_21_14.htm">啟示錄21:14</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_17.htm">17-20</a>)。
<p>城牆有十二根基, 有各樣寶石修飾, 是因為數字"十二"表示由良善而來的真理的全部, 在此表示教義的全部。關於這段以及上下文的詳解, 請參考我們的『破解啟示錄』一書。 </p>

217. 1. The precious stones that constituted the foundations of the New Jerusalem () mean the truths in the Word's literal meaning. In 209 above I mentioned that precious stones exist in the spiritual world just as they do in the physical world; their spiritual origin is the truths in the Word's literal meaning. This seems unbelievable, but it is nevertheless the truth. As a result, whenever precious stones are named in the Word, in the spiritual meaning they stand for truths. We are told that the foundations of the wall around the city, the New Jerusalem, were constructed of precious stones. These stones mean the true teachings in the new church, since the New Jerusalem means the new church in relation to its teachings from the Word. Its wall and the foundations of its wall, then, can have no other meaning than the outside of the Word, its literal meaning. The literal meaning is the source of what is taught; and through its teachings the literal meaning is the source of the church. It is like a wall with foundations that surrounds and protects a city.
<p>We read the following statements in the Book of Revelation about the New Jerusalem and its foundations:
<p>The angel measured the wall of the city of Jerusalem at 144 cubits, which was the measure of a human being, that is, of an angel. The wall had twelve foundations adorned with every precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sard, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst. (<a href="3927/revelation_21_17.htm">Revelation 21:17-20</a>)
<p>The twelve foundations of the wall were made of the same number of precious stones because the number twelve means everything true that comes from something good; therefore it also means all the church's teachings. For a detailed explanation of these verses (along with verses before and after them in that chapter) corroborated with parallels in the prophetic Word, see my . </p>

217. (i) THE TRUTHS OF THE LITERAL SENSE OF THE WORD ARE MEANT BY THE PRECIOUS STONES FORMING THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE NEW JERUSALEM IN <a href="3927/revelation_21_17.htm">Revelation 21:17-21</a>).<p>I mentioned above (<a href="209.htm">209</a>) that in the spiritual world precious stones are to be found just as in the natural one, and that they have a spiritual origin from the truths in the literal sense of the Word. Incredible as it may seem, this is in fact the truth. This is the reason why, every time there is a reference in the Word to precious stones, they mean in the spiritual sense truths, It follows from this that the precious stones, of which the foundations of the wall surrounding the city of the New Jerusalem are said to have been built, mean the truths of doctrine in the new church. For the New Jerusalem means the new church in respect of the doctrine it derives from the Word. Therefore its wall and the foundations of the wall must mean the external of the Word. This is its literal sense as the source of its doctrine, and by means of its doctrine the church. This sense is like a wall with its foundations, surrounding a city and making it secure.</p>
<p>
[2] The description in Revelation of the New Jerusalem and its foundations is this:<p>The angel measured the wall of the city of Jerusalem as one hundred and forty-four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that is, an angel. The wall had twelve foundations, decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh turquoise, the twelfth amethyst. .<p>The reason why the wall had twelve foundations, made of the same number of precious stones, is that the number twelve means the whole of truth derived from good, so here the whole of doctrine. These matters, together with the preceding and following parts of that chapter, can be found expounded in detail, with confirmations drawn from parallel passages in the Prophets, in my book Apocalypse Revealed. </p>

217. (1) The truths of the sense of the letter of the Word are meant by the precious stones of which the foundations of the New Jerusalem consisted (<a href="3927/revelation_21_17.htm">Revelation 21:17-21</a>). It has been mentioned above (n. <a href="209.htm">209[1-5]</a>) that precious stones exist in the spiritual world, as well as in the natural world, and that their spiritual origin is the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word. This seems incredible and yet it is true. And this is why precious stones are so frequently mentioned in the Word; and why in the spiritual sense they mean truths. From this it follows that the "precious stones" of which the foundations of the wall around the city New Jerusalem are said to have been built signify the truths of doctrine of the New Church, because "the New Jerusalem" means the New Church in respect to doctrine from the Word; and therefore its "wall" and foundations" of the wall, can mean nothing else than the external of the Word, which is the sense of the letter; for it is from this sense that doctrine exists, and the church by means of doctrine; while the external of the Word is like a wall with its foundations, which encloses and protects a city. Of the New Jerusalem and its foundations we read in the Apocalypse: <p>An angel measured the wall of the city Jerusalem, an hundred and forty and four cubits, which was the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. And the wall had twelve foundations adorned with every precious stone. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third a chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst (21<a href="3927/revelation_21_14.htm">:14</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_17.htm">17-20</a>). <p>The wall had twelve foundations formed of as many precious stones, because the number "twelve" signified all things of truth from good; so here all things of doctrine. But this and what precedes and follows in this chapter, may be seen explained in detail and confirmed by parallel passages from the prophetic Word, in our Apocalypse Revealed. </p>

217. (1) THE TRUTHS OF THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD ARE MEANT BY THE PRECIOUS STONES WHICH FORMED THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE NEW JERUSALEM, DESCRIBED IN <a href="3927/revelation_21_17.htm">Revelation 21:17-21</a>.<p>It was stated above in<a href="209.htm">209</a> that there are precious stones in the spiritual world, just as in the natural world, and that they derive their spiritual origin from the truths in the sense of the Letter of the Word. This appears incredible, and yet it is true. Therefore, wherever precious stones are mentioned in the Word, truths are understood by them in the spiritual sense. Hence it follows that by the precious stones which are said to have formed the foundations of the walls around the city, New Jerusalem, are signified the truths of the doctrine of the New Church, because by the New Jerusalem is meant the New Church as to doctrine from the Word. Therefore by its wall, and by the foundations of the wall, nothing else can be meant but the external of the Word, that is, the sense of its Letter; for it is this sense from which there is doctrine, and by means of doctrine, the Church and this sense is like a wall with foundations, that surrounds and secures the city. The following things are recorded in the Revelation concerning the New Jerusalem and its foundations:<p>"The angel measured the wall of the city Jerusalem, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. And the wall had twelve foundations, garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst." <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21</a> [<a href="3927/revelation_21_14.htm">14</a>], <a href="3927/revelation_21_17.htm">17-20</a>.<p>The foundations of the wall were twelve, formed of the same number of precious stones, because the number twelve signifies all things pertaining to truth from good, and so, in this passage, all things pertaining to doctrine. However, this passage and its context may be seen explained in detail, and confirmed by parallel passages from the Prophetical Books of the Word, in our work "The Apocalypse Revealed." </p>
