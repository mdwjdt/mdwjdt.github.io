<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第445节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>445</b>.从道德生活的本质可以看出，它是一种既遵守人类律法，也遵守神性律法的生活；因此，凡照着这两套律法如同一套律法生活之人，就是真正的道德人，他的生活是仁爱。若愿意，谁都能通过外在的道德生活理解仁爱的性质。只需将诸如文明社会中所看到的外在道德生活复制到内在人中，使他的意愿和思维与外在行为相似和一致，你就会看到仁爱的最佳范例。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #445 </h4>
<p>
445. 如果深思一下道德生活的本質, 能看出這樣的生活同時符合人間法律與神性法律。因此, 人若遵照這兩套法律如同一套去生活, 這人便是真正有道德之人, 他就活出義的生活。
<p>只要願意, 任何人通過思量外在的道德生活, 都能領會義的性質。只需複製社會交往中外在的道德生活於內在人之中, 以至於他的意志和認知與外在的行為相似與一致, 你將看到一個義的範本。 </p>

<p>
445. If we could see what a moral life is in its essence, we would see that it is a life in accordance with human laws and divine laws at the same time. Therefore people who live by both sets of laws as one law are truly moral and live a life of goodwill.
<p>Anyone who wants to grasp the nature of goodwill is capable of doing so by looking at the nature of outward moral life. Just copy the outward moral life you have in civil interaction into your inner self so that your inner willing and thinking parallel the actions of your outer self, and you will see a model of goodwill. </p>

445. Contemplation of moral life in its essence can show that it is life in accordance with human laws and at the same time Divine laws. If anyone therefore lives in accordance with those two sets of laws treating them as one, he is a truly moral person, and his life is charity. Anyone can grasp, if he wants, the nature of charity by considering external moral life. Simply copy external moral life, as it is to be seen in civilised society, in the internal man, so that his will and thought are similar to and in conformity with the deeds of the external, and you will see an ideal example of charity. </p>

<p>
445. Viewing moral life in its essence, it can be seen that it is a life that is in accordance both with human laws and with Divine laws; therefore he who lives in accordance with these two laws as one law is a truly moral man, and his life is charity. Anyone, if he will, can understand from external moral life the nature of charity. Only transfer external moral life, such as prevails in civil communities, over into the internal man, so that in its will and thought there may be a likeness and conformity to the acts in the external, and you will see charity in its true image. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #445 (Dick, 1950)
</h4>
<p>
445. If moral life is considered in its essence, it will be seen to be in agreement both with human and Divine law. Therefore, he who lives according to these two laws combined as one, is a truly moral man, and his life is charity. Every one, if he chooses, may comprehend the real nature of charity from the life that is externally moral. If the externally moral life, such as it is in the affairs of civil life, is transferred into the internal man, so that in the will and thought of the internal man the life resembles and conforms to the actions of the external man, you will then see charity truly exemplified. </p>

445. Si spectatur Vita Moralis in sua essentia, videri potest quod sit Vita secundum Leges humanas et simul Divinas, quare qui secundum binas illas Leges ut Unam vivit, is vere moralis homo est, et ejus vita est Charitas. Quisque potest comprehendere, si vult, ex Vita Morali externa, qualis est Charitas; transcribe modo Vitam moralem externam, qualis est in civilibus consortiis, in Internum hominem, ut in hujus voluntate et cogitatione sit similis et conformis actis in Externo, et videbis Charitatem in suo typo. </p>
