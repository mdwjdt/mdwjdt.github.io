850. After that, I saw some spirits coming up from the lower regions where I had heard those voices. They addressed me in a serious tone and said, "Those secrets that you enumerated in a long list a moment ago - why has your Lord revealed them to you, a lay person, and not to someone in the clergy?"
<p>"That was entirely up to the Lord," I said. "He prepared me for this assignment from the time when I first came of age. But let me ask you a question in return. When the Lord was in the world, why did he choose fishermen to be his disciples? Why did he not choose anyone from among the lawyers, scribes, priests, or rabbis? Discuss this among yourselves and use judgment in coming to your conclusion, and you will discover the reason. "
<p>When I said that, there was another murmur, and then silence. </p>

850. After this I saw some people coming up from the underworld, from where this discussion had taken place. They addressed me in a serious tone of voice and said: 'Why did your Lord reveal to you, who are a layman, the long list of secrets you have quoted, and not to one of the clergy?' I answered to this that this was the Lord's good pleasure, and that He had prepared me for this task from early manhood. 'However, let me ask you a question in return: why did the Lord, when He was in the world choose fishermen as His disciples and not some of the lawyers, scribes, priests or rabbis? Discuss this question among yourselves, and if you come to a judicious conclusion, you will discover the reason.' When they heard this there was some murmuring, and afterwards silence. </p>

After this I saw some persons ascending from the lower regions, from which these things had been heard; and addressing me in a grave tone, they said, "How is it that your Lord revealed the mysteries that you have just enumerated in a long series, to you who are a layman, and not to some one of the clergy?" <p>To this I replied, "Such was the good pleasure of the Lord, who prepared me for this office from my early youth. Nevertheless, I will ask you a question in return; Why did the Lord, when in the world, choose fishermen for His disciples, instead of some of the lawyers, scribes, priests, or rabbis? Discuss this question among yourselves, draw your conclusions from judgment, and you will discover the reason." <p>When they heard this, a murmur arose among them, and then they became silent. </p>

850. After this I saw certain spirits ascending from below where those voices came from, and they, addressing me in a grave tone, said, "Why has your Lord revealed the truths, which you have just recounted in a long series, to you a laymen, and not to one of the clergy?" To this I replied: "This is according to the good pleasure of the Lord, who prepared me for this office from my earliest years. But let me in turn ask you, Why did the Lord, when in the world, choose fishermen for His disciples, and not some of the lawyers, scribes, priests or Rabbis? Discuss this among yourselves, and if you exercise your judgment in forming your opinion, you will discover the reason." When they heard this, some murmuring arose, followed by silence. </p>

850. Post haec vidi quosdam ex Inferis, unde audita sunt illa, ascendentes, qui me tono gravi alloquuti dixerunt, quamobrem Dominus tuus Arcana, quae in longa serie modo enumeravisti, revelavit tibi qui es Laicus, et non alicui ex Clero; ad quae respondi, quod hoc in beneplacito Domini sit, qui me ad hoc munus a prima juventute praeparavit; attamen quaeram retro [ex] vobis, cur Dominus dum in Mundo fuit, elegit Piscatores in Discipulos, et non aliquos ex Legisperitis, Scribis, Sacerdotibus, seu Rabbinis; ventilate hoc inter vos, et ex judicio concludite, ac invenietis causam; his auditis factum est murmur, et post hoc silentium. </p>
