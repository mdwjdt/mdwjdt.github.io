<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>782</b>.由神那里从天而降的新耶路撒冷（启示录21章）表示新教会，原因在于，耶路撒冷是迦南地的都城，圣殿和祭祀的圣坛就在那里，并且一年三次在那里举行拜神仪式，届时全地的所有男子都要参加；还因为主就在耶路撒冷，在它的圣殿中施行教导，后来也是在那里荣耀了祂的人性。这就是为何“耶路撒冷”表教会的原因。“耶路撒冷”表教会，这一点从旧约中关于主建立新教会的预言显而易见，因为它在预言中被称为“耶路撒冷”。<br />只需引用经文本身，拥有内在理智者就能明白，“耶路撒冷”表教会。经文如下：<br />看哪，我造新天新地，从前的事不再被记念。看哪，我造耶路撒冷为人所喜，造其中的居民为人所乐；我必因耶路撒冷欢喜，因我的百姓快乐。那时，豺狼必与羊羔同食；在我圣山的遍处，它们都不伤人、不害物。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.17.htm">以赛亚书65:17</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.25.htm">25</a>）<br />我因锡安必不静默，为耶路撒冷必不息声，直到他的公义如光辉发出，他的救恩如明灯发亮。那时，列国必见你的公义，列王必见你的荣耀。你必得新名的称呼，是耶和华亲口所起的。你在耶和华的手中要作为华冠，在你神的掌上必作为王冕。耶和华喜悦你，你的地将要婚嫁。看哪，你的拯救者来到；看哪，他的赏赐在他那里；人必称他们为圣民，为耶和华的赎民；你也必称为被眷顾不撇弃的城。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.1.htm">以赛亚书62:1</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.11.htm">11</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.12.htm">12</a>）<br />锡安啊，兴起！兴起！披上你的能力。圣城耶路撒冷啊，穿上你华美的衣服！因为从今以后，未受割礼、不洁净的，必不再进入你中间。耶路撒冷啊，要抖下尘土，起来坐在位上！到那日，我的百姓必知道我的名，因为说这话的就是我；看哪，是我！耶和华安慰了他的百姓，救赎了耶路撒冷。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛52.1.htm">以赛亚书52:1</a>，<a

/>锡安的女子啊，应当歌唱！耶路撒冷的女子啊，应当满心欢喜快乐！以色列的王耶和华在你中间，你必不再惧怕灾祸；他必因你欢欣喜乐，默然爱你，且因你喜乐欢唱；我必使你们在地上的万民中有名声，得称赞。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/番3.14.htm">西番雅书3:14</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/番3.17.htm">17</a>，<a

/>耶和华如此说：我必回到锡安，住在耶路撒冷中；耶路撒冷必称为真理的城，耶和华的山必称为圣山。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.3.htm">撒迦利亚书8:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.20.htm">20</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.23.htm">23</a>）<br />那时你们就知道我是耶和华你们的神，且又住在锡安我的圣山，耶路撒冷必成为圣；到那日，大山要滴甜酒，小山要流奶子。耶路撒冷必存到万代。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.17.htm">约珥书3:17</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.21.htm">21</a>）<br />到那日，耶和华发生的苗必华美尊荣，地的出产必为以色列逃脱的人显为荣华茂盛。主以公义的灵，和焚烧的灵，将锡安女子的污秽洗去，又将耶路撒冷中杀人的血除净，那时，剩在锡安留在耶路撒冷的，必称在耶路撒冷生命册上记名的为圣。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛4.2.htm">以赛亚书4:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛4.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛4.4.htm">4</a>）<br />末后的日子，耶和华殿的山必坚立，超乎诸山；因为训诲必出于锡安，耶和华的言语必出于耶路撒冷。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥4.1.htm">弥迦书4:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥4.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥4.8.htm">8</a>）<br />那时，人必称耶路撒冷为耶和华的宝座，万国必到耶路撒冷，在耶和华立名的地方聚集；他们必不再随从自己顽梗的恶心行事。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.17.htm">耶利米书3:17</a>）<br />你要看锡安──我们守圣节的城；你的眼必见耶路撒冷为安静的居所，为不挪移的帐幕；橛子永不拔出；绳索一根也不折断。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.20.htm">以赛亚书33:20</a>）（还有别处，见于以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.23.htm">24:23</a>；<a

/>在此，“耶路撒冷”表主即将建立的教会，并非指犹太人所居住的耶路撒冷，这一点从引用的经文所描述的细节明显可知。例如，耶和华神要造新天新地，那时，也要造耶路撒冷，她必作为华冠和王冕；她必被称为圣和真理的城，耶和华的宝座，安静的居所，为不挪移的帐幕。还说，豺狼必与羊羔同食；大山要滴甜酒，小山要流奶子，它必存到万代等等。论及她的百姓则说，他们圣洁，每个人都被记在生命册上，被称为耶和华所救赎的。此外，所有这些经文都在阐述主的到来，尤其祂的第二次降临，届时会有如此处所描述的耶路撒冷；因为之前她没有婚嫁，即没有成为新娘和羔羊的妻，如在启示录中所描述的新耶路撒冷那样。<br />先前的教会（即当今教会）在但以理书中以“耶路撒冷”来表示，以下经文描述了它的初期：<br />你当知道、当明白，从出令重新建造耶路撒冷，直到有受膏君的时候，必有七个七和六十二个七。正在艰难的时候，耶路撒冷城连街带濠都必重新建造。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.25.htm">但以理书9:25</a>）<br />以下经文则描述了它的末期：<br />最后那行毁坏可憎的如飞而来；并且有忿怒倾在那行毁坏的身上，直到所定的结局。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.27.htm">但以理书9:27</a>）<br />主在马太福音中的话指的就是最后这段经文：<br />你们看见先知但以理所说的‘那行毁坏可憎的’站在圣地（读这经的人须要会意）。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.15.htm">马太福音24:15</a>）<br />上述经文中的“耶路撒冷”并非表示犹太人所居的耶路撒冷，这一点从说它已完全丧失，注定被毁灭的经文可以证实（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.1.htm">如见于耶利米书5:1</a>；<a

<h4 align="center">True Christianity #782 (Rose, 2010)
</h4>
<p>
782. The New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven (Revelation 21) means the new church. For one thing, Jerusalem was the largest city in the land of Canaan. The Temple was there. The altar was there. The sacrifices were performed there. It was a center for divine worship. Three times a year every male in the entire country was commanded to come worship there.
<p>Another reason is that the Lord was in Jerusalem and taught in its Temple; it was there that he glorified his human manifestation. For these reasons Jerusalem means the church.
<p>The fact that Jerusalem means the church is abundantly clear in what the prophets of the Old Testament say about the new church that the Lord is going to establish, which they refer to as Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>
[2] I will present only passages in which the fact that Jerusalem means the church is easy to see for anyone who has the ability to reason inwardly. We will limit ourselves, then, to just the following.
<p>Behold, I am creating a new heaven and a new earth, and the earlier heaven and earth will not be remembered. Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a rejoicing and its people a joy, so that I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take joy in my people.

<p>For Zion's sake I will not be quiet, for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until its justice goes forth as brightness, and its salvation is like a burning lamp. Then the nations will see your justice and every monarch will see your glory. You will be called by a new name that the mouth of Jehovah will announce. You will also be a beautiful crown and a royal miter in the hand of your God. Jehovah will be pleased with you, and your land will be married. Behold, your salvation is coming, and his reward is with him. They will call them "a holy people" and "those redeemed by Jehovah. " You will be called a sought-after city, and not a deserted city.

[3] Awake, awake! Put on your strength, O Zion. Put on your beautiful clothes, O Jerusalem, holy city. The uncircumcised and the unclean will not come to you any more. Shake yourself from the dust; arise. Sit down, O Jerusalem. The people will recognize my name in that day; I am the one who is saying, "Behold, it is I. " Jehovah has comforted his people.

<p>Shout, O daughter of Zion. Be joyful with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. The king of Israel is in your midst. Do not fear evil any more. He will be glad and joyful about you. He will rest in your love. He will rejoice over you with shouting. I will give you a name and praise among all the peoples of the earth.

<p>Thus said Jehovah, "I will turn back to Zion and I will live in the center of Jerusalem.

" (<a href="3927/zechariah_8_3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_8_20.htm">20-23</a>)
<p>Then you will know that I am Jehovah your God, living on Zion, the holy mountain, and Jerusalem will be holy.

<p>At that time they will call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah, and all the nations will be gathered together to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem. No longer will they go toward the obstinacy of their evil heart. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_3_17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>)
<p>Look toward Zion, the city of our appointed feasts. Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a peaceful dwelling place, a tabernacle that will not be taken down. Its stakes will never be removed and its ropes will not be broken. (<a href="3927/isaiah_33_20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a>)

<p>
[5] Jerusalem in the passages just quoted does not mean the Jerusalem where Jews once lived, but the church of the Lord to come. This is clear from every detail of the description in the passages: for example, the point that Jehovah God is going to create a new heaven and a new earth, including a Jerusalem; that this Jerusalem is going to be a beautiful crown and a royal miter; that it is going to be called "holy," "the city of truth," "the throne of Jehovah," "a peaceful dwelling place," "a tabernacle that will not be taken down"; that the wolf and the lamb will feed together there; and we are told that the mountains there will drip with new wine, the hills will flow with milk, and it will remain from generation to generation. This is also clear from what we are told of the people there, that they are holy, they have all been written down as alive, and they are to be called "those redeemed by Jehovah. "
<p>What is more, all these passages indicate that only at the time of the Lord's Coming, especially his Second Coming, [but not before,] will "Jerusalem" be the way these passages describe it. Before that, Jerusalem is not married; that is, it has not yet become the bride and wife of the Lamb, which is how the New Jerusalem is described in the Book of Revelation.
</p>
<p>
[6] In Daniel, Jerusalem means the church of today, the former [Christian] church. The beginning of this church is described in the following words.
<p>Know and understand that from the going forth of the Word even to the restoration and building of Jerusalem, to the time of the Messiah's rule, is seven weeks. After sixty-two weeks the street and the moat will be rebuilt and restored, but in troublesome times. (<a href="3927/daniel_9_25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>)
<p>The end of the church of today is described in the following words from the same chapter:
<p>In the end desolation [will fly in] on a bird of abominations; even to the close and the cutting down, it will drip steadily upon the devastation. (<a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>)
<p>The final stages of the church of today are also what the following words of the Lord in Matthew are referring to:
<p>When you see that the abomination of desolation foretold by the prophet Daniel is standing in the holy place, let those who read note it well. (<a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>)
<p>Evidence that Jerusalem in the passages above does not mean the Jerusalem where Jews once lived is found in the passages in the Word in which we are told that Jerusalem has already been completely destroyed or is going to be in the future. See <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_6_6.htm">6:6-7</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_17.htm">7:17-18</a>, and following; <a href="3927/jeremiah_8_5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5-7</a>, and following; , and following; <a href="3927/jeremiah_13_9.htm">Jeremiah 13:9-10</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_13_14.htm">14</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_14_16.htm">14:16</a>; <a href="3927/lamentations_1_8.htm">Lamentations 1:8-9</a>, <a href="3927/lamentations_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_4_1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1</a> to the end; <a href="3927/ezekiel_5_9.htm">Ezekiel 5:9</a> to the end; <a href="3927/ezekiel_12_18.htm">Ezekiel 12:18-19</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_15_6.htm">15:6-8</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_1.htm">16:1-63</a>; ; <a href="3927/matthew_23_37.htm">Matthew 23:37-38</a>; <a href="3927/luke_19_41.htm">Luke 19:41-44</a>; <a href="3927/luke_21_20.htm">21:20-22</a>; <a href="3927/luke_23_28.htm">23:28-30</a>; besides many other passages.

The reason why the new church is meant by the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21</a>), is that Jerusalem was the capital city in the land of Canaan. It was there that the temple was and the altar where sacrifices were made, and so the Divine worship to which three times a year every male in the whole land was commanded to come. It was also because Jerusalem is where the Lord was, and taught in its temple; and He afterwards there glorified His Human. These are the reasons why Jerusalem means the church, It is perfectly plain that Jerusalem means the church from the prophecies in the Old Testament about the new church to be founded by the Lord, since it is there called Jerusalem.</p>
<p>
[2] It is only necessary to quote the passages themselves, for anyone possessed of inward reason to be able to see, that Jerusalem there means the church. Let the following passages suffice:<p>Behold, I create a new heaven and a new earth; the former ones will not be remembered. Look, I shall make Jerusalem an exultation, and its people happiness, so that I may exult over Jerusalem and rejoice over my people. Then the wolf and the lamb will feed together. They will do no harm in all the mountain of my holiness, <a href="3927/isaiah_65_17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-19</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_65_25.htm">25</a>.<p>For Zion's sake I will not be silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her righteousness goes forth like a beam of light, and her salvation burns like a lamp. Then the nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory. And you will be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah will utter, and you will be a crown of beauty [in the hand of Jehovah] <sup "fn10_2">2</sup>
and a diadem of kingship in the hand of your God. Jehovah will be pleased in you, and your land will be married. Behold, your salvation will come, behold, His reward is with Him. And they will call them the people of holiness, the redeemed of Jehovah. And you will be called a city sought after, not abandoned, <a href="3927/isaiah_62_1.htm">Isaiah 62:1-4</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_62_11.htm">11-12</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] Awake, awake, Zion, put on your strength. Put on the clothes of your beauty, Jerusalem, city of holiness; for no more will the uncircumcised and the unclean come into you. Shake off the dust, arise and take your seat, Jerusalem. The people will know my name on that day, for I am he that speaks, here I am. Jehovah has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem, <a href="3927/isaiah_52_1.htm">Isaiah 52:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_52_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_52_9.htm">9</a>.<p>Shout for joy, daughter of Zion, rejoice with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem. The king of Israel is in your midst. Fear evil no longer. He will rejoice over you with joy; he will be satisfied in his <sup "fn10_3">3</sup>
love, he will exult over you with a shout of joy. I will make you a name and the object of praise to all the peoples of the earth, <a href="3927/zephaniah_3_14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14-17</a>, <a href="3927/zephaniah_3_20.htm">20</a>.<p>Thus spoke Jehovah your Redeemer, telling Jerusalem, You will be dwelt in, <a href="3927/isaiah_44_24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_44_26.htm">26</a>.<p>Thus spoke Jehovah, I will return to Zion and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Therefore Jerusalem will be called the city of truth, and the mountain of Jehovah Zebaoth the mountain of holiness, <a href="3927/zechariah_8_3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_8_20.htm">20-23</a>.<p>Then you will know that I am Jehovah your God, who dwell in Zion, the mountain of holiness; and Jerusalem will be holiness. And it will happen on that day that the mountains will drip new wine, and the hills will flow with milk. And Jerusalem will stay fixed from one generation to another, <a href="3927/joel_3_17.htm">Joel 3:17-21</a>.</p>
<p>
[4] On that day the shoot of Jehovah will be an adornment and a glory; and it will come about that the one who is left in Zion, the one who remains in Jerusalem, will be called holy, everyone enrolled with a view to life in Jerusalem, <a href="3927/isaiah_4_2.htm">Isaiah 4:2-3</a>.<p>At the end of days the mountain of Jehovah's house will be established on the head of mountains; for from Zion will come forth teaching, and the Word of Jehovah from Jerusalem, <a href="3927/micah_4_1.htm">Micah 4:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/micah_4_8.htm">8</a>.<p>At that time they will call Jerusalem Jehovah's throne, and all nations will be gathered to Jerusalem for Jehovah's name's sake, and they will no longer follow the prompting of their evil hearts, <a href="3927/jeremiah_3_17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>.<p>Look to Zion, the city of our appointed feast, let you eyes behold Jerusalem, a tranquil dwelling, a tent which will not be blown away. Its pegs will never be removed, and its ropes will not be pulled up, <a href="3927/isaiah_33_20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a>.<p>There are further passages such as <a href="3927/isaiah_24_23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_37_32.htm">37:32</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_66_10.htm">66:10-14</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_12_3.htm">Zechariah 12:3</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_12_6.htm">6-10</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_14_8.htm">14:8</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_11.htm">11-12</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="3927/malachi_3_4.htm">Malachi 3:4</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_122_1.htm">Psalms 122:1-7</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_137_4.htm">137:4-6</a>.</p>
<p>
[5] It is obvious from the details of the description of Jerusalem in the passages quoted that it means there the church to be founded by the Lord, and not the Jerusalem where the Jews lived. For instance, it is said Jehovah will create a new heaven and a new earth, and also at that time Jerusalem; that it will be a crown of beauty and a diadem of kingship; that it is to be called holiness and a city of truth, Jehovah's throne, a tranquil dwelling, a tent which will not be blown away. It is said that the wolf and the lamb will feed together there; that there the mountains will drip new wine, and the hills flow with milk, and it will stay fixed for one generation after another; and much more besides. It is also said of its people that they are holy, everyone enrolled with a view to life, and they are to be called Jehovah's redeemed. Moreover, all those passages deal with the Lord's coming, especially His second coming, when there will be a Jerusalem such as is there described; for it has not previously been married, that is, made the bride and wife of the Lamb, as the New Jerusalem is described in Revelation.</p>
<p>
[6] The earlier, that is, the present-day church, is meant by Jerusalem in Daniel, and its beginnings are there described as follows:<p>Know and perceive, from the time the word went forth to restore and build Jerusalem, until the coming of the Messiah, the prince, will be seven weeks. Afterwards for sixty-two weeks the street and the moat will be restored and built, but at a time of distress, <a href="3927/daniel_9_25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>.<p>Its end is there described as follows:<p>At last upon the bird of abominations desolation, and it will drip upon devastation up to the point of ending and cutting off, <a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>.<p>It is this last passage which is meant by the Lord's words in Matthew:<p>When you see the abomination of desolation, foretold by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place - let him who reads take due note, <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>.<p>It can be established that Jerusalem in the passages quoted above does not mean the Jerusalem inhabited by the Jews, from the passages in the Word which say that it has been utterly lost and is to be destroyed; for instance, <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_6_6.htm">6:6-7</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_17.htm">7:17</a>ff; <a href="3927/jeremiah_8_6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6</a>ff; <a href="3927/jeremiah_9_11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11-12</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_9_14.htm">14</a>ff; <a href="3927/jeremiah_13_9.htm">Jeremiah 13:9-10</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_13_14.htm">14</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_14_16.htm">14:16</a>; <a href="3927/lamentations_1_8.htm">Lamentations 1:8-9</a>, <a href="3927/lamentations_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_4_1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1</a> - end; <a href="3927/ezekiel_5_9.htm">Ezekiel 5:9</a>- end; <a href="3927/ezekiel_12_18.htm">Ezekiel 12:18-19</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_15_6.htm">15:6-8</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_1.htm">16:1-63</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_23_1.htm">23</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_23_37.htm">Matthew 23:37-38</a>; <a href="3927/luke_19_41.htm">Luke 19:41-44</a>; <a href="3927/luke_21_20.htm">21:20-22</a>; <a href="3927/luke_23_28.htm">23:28-30</a>; and in many other passages.

782. By the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven (Revelation 21), a new church is meant for the reason that Jerusalem was the metropolis in the land of Canaan, and the temple and altar were there, and the sacrifices were offered there, thus the Divine worship itself, to which every male of the whole land was commanded to go three times a year, was celebrated there; and also for the reason that the Lord was in Jerusalem, and taught in its temple, and afterward glorified His Human there. This is why "Jerusalem" signifies the church. That "Jerusalem" means the church can be clearly seen from the prophecies in the Old Testament respecting the new church to be established by the Lord, in that it is there called "Jerusalem."
</p>
<p>
[2] Those passages only shall be here cited from which anyone endowed with interior reason can see that "Jerusalem" there means the church. These are the following: <p>Behold, I create a new heaven and a new earth, and the former shall not be remembered. Behold, I will create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a gladness; that I may rejoice over Jerusalem and be glad over My people. Then the wolf and the lamb shall feed together; they shall not do evil in the whole mountain of My holiness (<a href="3927/isaiah_65_17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-19</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_65_25.htm">25</a>). <p>For Zion's sake will I not be silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a lamp burneth. Then the nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory, and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of Jehovah shall utter. And thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. Jehovah delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married. Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, His reward is with Him; and they shall call them the people of holiness, the redeemed of Jehovah; and thou shalt be called a city sought out, not forsaken (<a href="3927/isaiah_62_1.htm">Isaiah 62:1-4</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_62_11.htm">11-12</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on the garments of thy beauty, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O Jerusalem. My people shall know My name in that day, for I am He that doth speak; behold, it is I. Jehovah hath comforted His people; He hath redeemed Jerusalem (<a href="3927/isaiah_52_1.htm">Isaiah 52:1, 2</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_52_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_52_9.htm">9</a>). <p>Sing for joy, O daughter of Zion; be glad with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem; the king of Israel is in the midst of thee; thou shall not fear evil any more; He will rejoice over thee with joy; He will rest in thy love; He will joy over thee with singing; I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth (<a href="3927/zephaniah_3_14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14-17</a>, <a href="3927/zephaniah_3_20.htm">20</a>). <p>Thus said Jehovah thy Redeemer, saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_44_26.htm">26</a>). <p>Thus saith Jehovah: I will return unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; whence Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth, and the mountain of Jehovah of Hosts the holy mountain (<a href="3927/zechariah_8_3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_8_20.htm">20-23</a>). <p>Then shall ye know that I am Jehovah your God dwelling in Zion, the mountain of holiness, and Jerusalem shall be holiness; and it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk. And Jerusalem shall abide to generation and generation (<a href="3927/joel_3_17.htm">Joel 3:17-21</a>).

[4] In that day shall the shoot of Jehovah be for beauty and glory, and it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy everyone that is written unto life in Jerusalem (<a href="3927/isaiah_4_2.htm">Isaiah 4:2, 3</a>). <p>In the end of days it shall be that the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established as the head of the mountains; for out of Zion shall go forth doctrine, and the Word of Jehovah from Jerusalem (<a href="3927/micah_4_1.htm">Micah 4:1, 2</a>, <a href="3927/micah_4_8.htm">8</a>). <p>At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah and all nations shall be gathered unto it, because of the name of Jehovah at Jerusalem; neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart (<a href="3927/jeremiah_3_17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>). <p>Look upon Zion, the city of our set feast; let thine eye see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; the stakes thereof shall never be removed; and the cords thereof shall not be broken (<a href="3927/isaiah_33_20.htm">Isaiah 33:20</a>). <p>(So also elsewhere, as in <a href="3927/isaiah_24_23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_37_32.htm">37:32</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_66_10.htm">66:10-14</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_12_3.htm">Zechariah 12:3</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_12_6.htm">6-10</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_14_8.htm">14:8</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_11.htm">11, 12</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="3927/malachi_3_4.htm">Malachi 3:4</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_122_1.htm">Psalms 122:1-7</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_137_4.htm">137:4-6</a>).

[5] That "Jerusalem" means here a church about to be established by the Lord, and not the Jerusalem inhabited by the Jews, is evident from the particulars of its description in the passages quoted; as that Jehovah God was to create a new heaven and a new earth, and after that Jerusalem; and that she should be a crown of glory and a royal diadem; that she should be called holiness, a city of truth, the throne of Jehovah, a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that should not be taken down; that there the wolf and the lamb are to feed together; that the mountains there will drop down new wine, and the hills flow with milk, and Jerusalem shall abide to generation and generation, with many other things. It is also said of the people there that they are holy, that they are all written unto life, and shall be called the redeemed of Jehovah. All these passages, moreover, treat of the Lord's coming, especially of His second coming, when Jerusalem is to be such as is there described; for until then she was not married, that is, made the bride and wife of the Lamb, as the New Jerusalem is said to be in the Apocalypse.
</p>
<p>
[6] The former church (that is, the existing church), is meant by "Jerusalem" in Daniel, and its beginning is there described as follows: <p>Know and perceive, that from the going forth of the Word, even to the restoration and building of Jerusalem, even to the Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks. After the threescore and two weeks it shall be restored and built with street and moat, but in straitness of times (Dan. <a href="3927/daniel_9_25.htm">9:25</a>). <p>But its end is there described by the following: <p>At last upon the bird of abominations shall be desolation; and even to the consummation and decision shall it drop upon the devastation (Dan. <a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">9:27</a>). <p>This last passage is referred to by the Lord's words in Matthew: <p>When ye shall see the abomination of desolation predicted by Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place let him that readeth note it well (Matt.<a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">24:15</a>). <p>That "Jerusalem" in the foregoing passages does not mean the Jerusalem inhabited by the Jews can be seen from those passages in the Word where the latter is said to be utterly lost, and destined to be destroyed (as in <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_6_6.htm">6:6-7</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_17.htm">7:17-34</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_8_6.htm">8:6-22</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_9_10.htm">9:10-22</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_13_9.htm">13:9-10</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_13_14.htm">14</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_14_16.htm">14:16</a>; <a href="3927/lamentations_1_8.htm">Lamentations 1:8-9</a>, <a href="3927/lamentations_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_4_1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_5_9.htm">5:9-17</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_12_8.htm">12:8</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_12_19.htm">12:19</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_15_6.htm">15:6-8</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_1.htm">16:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_23_1.htm">23:1</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_23_37.htm">Matthew 23:37-38</a>; <a href="3927/luke_19_41.htm">Luke 19:41-44</a>; <a href="3927/luke_21_20.htm">21:20-22</a>; <a href="3927/luke_23_28.htm">23:28-30</a>; besides many other passages); as also from the passages where it is called "Sodom" (<a href="3927/isaiah_3_9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_23_14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_48.htm">16:48</a>). </p>

782. A New Church is meant by the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>, because Jerusalem was the Metropolis in the land of Canaan; the temple and the altar were there, and there also sacrifices were offered, and thus Divine worship was performed. To this worship every male in the whole land was commanded to go three times a year; and further, because the Lord was in Jerusalem, and taught in its temple, and afterwards glorified His Human there. This is why Jerusalem signifies the Church. That Jerusalem means the Church is clearly evident from the prophecies in the Old Testament respecting the New Church to be established by the Lord, for it is there called Jerusalem.</p>
<p>
[2] Only those passages will now be quoted from which every one endowed with interior reason may see that Jerusalem there means the Church. The following passages will suffice:<p>"Behold, I create a new heaven (A.V., new heavens), and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered... behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy, that I may (A.V., I will) rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people... The wolf and the lamb shall feed together... They shall not hurt... in all my holy mountain" <a href="3927/isaiah_65_17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-19</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_65_25.htm">25</a>.<p>"For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth its brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth. And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of JEHOVAH shall name. Thou shalt also be a crown of glory... and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God... For Jehovah shall delight (A.V., delighteth) in thee, and thy land shall be married... Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, His reward is with Him... and they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of JEHOVAH: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken" <a href="3927/isaiah_62_1.htm">Isaiah 62:1-4</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_62_11.htm">11-12</a>.</p>

[3] "Awake! awake! put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem... Therefore my people shall know my name... in that day. For I am He that doth speak; behold, it is I... JEHOVAH hath comforted His people, He hath redeemed Jerusalem" <a href="3927/isaiah_3_1.htm">Isaiah 3:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_3_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_3_9.htm">9</a>.<p>"Sing, O daughter of Zion... rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem... The King of Israel... is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not fear (A.V., see) evil any more... He will rejoice over thee with joy; He will rest in thy (A. V., His) love; He will joy over thee with singing... I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth" <a href="3927/zephaniah_3_14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14-17</a>, <a href="3927/zephaniah_3_20.htm">20</a>.<p>"Thus saith JEHOVAH, thy Redeemer... that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited" <a href="3927/isaiah_44_24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_44_26.htm">26</a>.<p>"Thus saith JEHOVAH; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called, A city of truth; and the mountain of JEHOVAH ZEBAOTH, The holy mountain" <a href="3927/zechariah_8_3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_8_20.htm">20-23</a>.<p>"So shall ye know that I am JEHOVAH thy God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy...

<p>
[4] "In that day shall the branch of JEHOVAH be beautiful and glorious... And, it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written for life (A.V., among the living) in Jerusalem" <a href="3927/isaiah_4_2.htm">Isaiah 4:2-3</a>.<p>"But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains... for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the Word of JEHOVAH from Jerusalem" <a href="3927/micah_4_1.htm">Micah 4:1-2</a>.<p>"At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of JEHOVAH; and all the nations shall be gathered... on account of (A.V., to) the name of JEHOVAH, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart" <a href="3927/jeremiah_3_17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>.<p>"Look upon Zion, the city of our stated feast (A.

<p>
[5] The Church to be established by the Lord is meant by these passages, and not the city of Jerusalem inhabited by the Jews. This is evident from every detail of its description in the passages quoted; as that Jehovah God would create a new heaven and a new earth, and also Jerusalem at the same time; and that this Jerusalem should be a crown of glory and a royal diadem; that it was to be called holiness, the city of truth, the throne of Jehovah, a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that should not be taken down; that there the wolf and the lamb should feed together. It is said also, that there the mountains should drop new wine, and the hills flow with milk and that it should remain from generation to generation; besides many other things. It is said also of the people that they should be holy, every one written for life, and that they should be called the redeemed of Israel. Moreover, all these passages treat of the Coming of the Lord, especially His second Coming, when Jerusalem will be such as it is there described; for before this she was not married, that is, made the Bride and Wife of the Lamb, as the New Jerusalem is declared to be in the Revelation.</p>
<p>
[6] The former Church, or the Church of the present day, is meant by Jerusalem in Daniel, and its beginning is described as follows:<p>"Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the word (A.V., commandment) to restore and to build Jerusalem, unto Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks; after three score and two weeks the street shall be restored and built again, and the meet (A.V., wall), but in troublous times" <a href="3927/daniel_9_25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>.<p>But its end is described in the same chapter in these words:<p>"At length upon the bird of abominations shall be desolation; and even to consummation and decision it shall drop upon the devastation (A.V., for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even unto the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate)" <a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>.<p>This end the Lord thus describes in Matthew:<p>"When ye... shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand)," <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">24:15</a>.<p>That Jerusalem in the passages quoted above does not mean the city of Jerusalem which was inhabited by the Jews, may be evident from many places in the Word where it is said that it was utterly lost, and was to be destroyed, as in <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_6_6.htm">6:6-7</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_17.htm">7:17-18</a> and following verses; <a href="3927/jeremiah_8_6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6-8</a> and following verses; <a href="3927/jeremiah_9_10.htm">Jeremiah 9:10-11</a> and following verses; <a href="3927/jeremiah_13_9.htm">Jeremiah 13:9-10</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_13_14.htm">14</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_14_16.htm">14:16</a>; <a href="3927/lamentations_1_8.htm">Lamentations 1:8-9</a>, <a href="3927/lamentations_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_4_1.htm">Ezekiel 4</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_12_18.htm">12:18-19</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_15_6.htm">15:6-8</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_1.htm">16</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_23_1.htm">23</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_23_37.htm">Matthew 23:37-38</a>; <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
