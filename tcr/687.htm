<p>
687. Baptism as the process of being regenerated is represented by many things both in heaven and in the world.
<p>In heaven, it is represented by the clothes of white and clothes of red just mentioned. It is also represented by the marriage between the church and the Lord; by the new heaven and the new earth; and by the New Jerusalem coming down, about which the One sitting on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new" (). It is represented by the river of living water coming forth from the throne of God and of the Lamb (<a href="3927/revelation_22_1.htm">Revelation 22:1-2</a>). It is also meant by the five prudent young women who had both lamps and oil and who walked into the wedding with the bridegroom (<a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_25_10.htm">10</a>). The person who has been baptized, that is, regenerated, is meant by the "creatures" [to whom the gospel is to be preached] (<a href="3927/mark_16_15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>) and by the "creation" (<a href="3927/romans_8_19.htm">Romans 8:19-21</a>), and the "new creation" (<a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="3927/galatians_6_15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>); "creature" comes from the verb "to be created," which means to be regenerated (see <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_254.htm">Revelation Unveiled 254</a>).
</p>
 <p>
[2] In the world, the process of being regenerated is represented by various things. For example, by the flowering of all things on earth in springtime and the ensuing stages of growth to the point of bearing fruit. Likewise, by the stages of development that every type of tree, bush, and flower goes through from the first to the last warm month.
<p>The process of being regenerated is also represented by the development of fruits of all kinds from initial stem to ripe fruit. It is represented by the morning and evening rains and the falling dew that cause flowers to open, as they also close themselves to the darkness of night. It is represented by the fragrances of gardens and fields; and by the rainbow in the cloud (<a href="3927/genesis_9_14.htm">Genesis 9:14-17</a>). It is also represented by the radiant colors of sunrise.
<p>The process of being regenerated is also represented in a general way by the constant renewal of all things in the body by chyle and animal spirits and then blood. Blood is constantly being purified of worn-out elements and renewed and in a sense regenerated.
</p>
<p>
[3] If we look even to the lowliest creatures on earth, we see an image of the process of regeneration in the miraculous transformation of silkworms, and of many other grubs and caterpillars into nymphs and butterflies, and of other creatures that in time are embellished with wings.
<p>To these we might add a lighter example: the desire of some songbirds to splash in the water in order to wash and cleanse themselves before returning to their singing.
<p>In brief, the whole world on every level of existence is full of symbols and emblems of regeneration. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #687 (Chadwick, 1988)

<p>
687. Moreover, baptism as representing regeneration is evidenced by many things in heaven and in the world. In heaven, as just said, by white and purple clothing, and besides by the wedding of the church with the Lord; also by the new heaven and the new earth, and the New Jerusalem coming down from there, of which He who sits upon the throne said:<p>Behold, I shall make all things new, <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-5</a>.<p>It is also meant by the river of water of life <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
which issues from the throne of God and the Lamb (<a href="3927/revelation_22_1.htm">Revelation 22:1-2</a>); and also by the five wise virgins who had lamps and oil, and went in with the bridegroom to the wedding (<a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_25_10.htm">10</a>). One who is baptised, that is, regenerated, is meant by every creature (<a href="3927/mark_16_15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; <a href="3927/romans_8_19.htm">Romans 8:19-21</a>) and by a new creature (<a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="3927/galatians_6_15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>); for creature is derived from being created, which also means being regenerated (see Apocalypse Revealed 254).</p>
<p>
 [2] In the world there are various representations of regeneration, such as the way all the earth's products flower in springtime, and then stage by stage develop until they bear fruit; and likewise by the way any tree, shrub or flower grows from the first month of warm weather until the last. Another representation is the stages by which all fruits gradually ripen from the first rudiments to the full development. Then again it is represented by early morning and late evening showers, and by dew, which when it falls makes flowers open, and the shades of night make them close again; or again by the fragrant smells from gardens and fields. Another representation is by the rainbow in the cloud (<a href="3927/genesis_9_14.htm">Genesis 9:14-17</a>), as well as by the glorious colours of sunrise. In general it is represented by the way everything in the body is continually renewed by means of the chyle and animal spirit, and so by the blood, which perpetually undergoes purification from exhausted matter, and is so renewed and, so to speak, regenerated.</p>
<p>
[3] If we turn our attention to the humblest creatures on earth, there is a wonderful picture of regeneration presented by the way silk-worms and many caterpillars are transformed into nymphs and butterflies, and other insects which as time goes on are adorned with wings. To these examples even more trivial ones can be added, such as the fondness of certain birds for plunging in water in order to wash and cleanse themselves, after which they revert to their role as song-birds. In short, the whole world from first to last is full of representations and models of regeneration.<p>

687. Furthermore, baptism as regeneration is represented by many things both in heaven and in the world; in heaven, as just said, by white and purple garments, also by the marriage of the church with the Lord, also by the new heaven and the new earth, and the New Jerusalem descending therefrom, Of which He who sat upon the throne, said: <p>Behold, I make all things new (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-5</a>); <p>And by the river of living water proceeding out of the throne of God and the Lamb (<a href="3927/revelation_22_1.htm">Revelation 22:1, 2</a>); <p>Also by the five prudent virgins who had lamps and oil, and went in with the bridegroom to the marriage feast (<a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1, 2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_25_10.htm">10</a>). <p>One who is baptized, that is regenerated, is meant by, <p>Creature (<a href="3927/mark_16_15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; <a href="3927/romans_8_19.htm">Romans 8:19-21</a>); <p>and by, <p>A new creature (<a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="3927/galatians_6_15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>); <p>for he is called "a creature" from his being created; and this also signifies to be regenerated (as may be seen in the Apocalypse Revealed, n. <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_254.htm">254</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] In the world regeneration is represented by various things, as by the blossoming of all things on earth in spring, and by the gradual development of the blossoms even to the fruit; also by the growth of every tree, shrub and flower, from the first warm month to the last. It is also represented by the progressive ripening of all kinds of fruit from the earliest germ to the end of the process; then again by morning and evening showers, and by dews, at the coming of which the flowers open, while they close at the approach of the darkness of night; also by the fragrance from gardens and fields; by the rainbow in the cloud (<a href="3927/genesis_9_14.htm">Genesis 9:14-17</a>); by the resplendent colors of the dawn; and in general by the continual renovation of everything in the body by means of the chyle and the animal spirit, and consequently by the blood. The purification of this from exhausted material, and its renovation, and seeming regeneration, are perpetual.
</p>
<p>
[3] If we turn our thoughts to the more insignificant things on earth, an image of regeneration is presented in the wonders transformation of the silk-worm and other worms into nymphs and butterflies, and of still other kinds which after a time are provided with wings; to which may be added still more trifling matters, as the desire of certain birds to plunge themselves into water for the sake of washing and cleansing themselves, after which they return as warblers to their songs. In a word, the whole world from what is first to what is last in it is full of representations and types of regeneration. </p>

687. Moreover, Baptism is represented, as is regeneration, both in heaven and in the world by many things. In heaven, as has just been stated, it is represented by white and purple garments; by the marriage of the Church with the Lord; and also by the new heaven and the new earth, from which the New Jerusalem descends. Concerning this He that sat upon the throne said,<p>"Behold, I make all things new" <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-5</a>;<p>and by "the river of the water of life... proceeding out of the throne of God and of the lamb" <a href="3927/revelation_22_1.htm">Revelation 22:1-2</a>;<p>And also by the five wise virgins, who had lamps and oil, and who entered in with the bridegroom to the marriage, <a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_25_10.htm">10</a>.<p>One who is baptized, that is, regenerated, is meant by:<p>"Creature," <a href="3927/mark_16_15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; <a href="3927/romans_8_19.htm">Romans 8:19-21</a>:<p>and by:<p>"A new creature" <a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="3927/galatians_6_15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>;<p>for the name creature is used, being derived from "being created," which signifies also "being regenerated," as may be seen in the <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_254.htm">Apocalypse Revealed 254</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] In the world, regeneration is variously represented, as by the blossoming of all things on earth in the spring, and by the gradual development of the blossoms into fruit; and by the growth of every tree, shrub and flower, from the first month of the warm season to the last. It is also represented by the gradual progress of all fruits towards maturity, from the first living shoot to their perfection; also by morning and evening showers and by dews, on the fall of which the flowers open, to close again on the approach of the shades of evening; by the fragrance from gardens and fields; by the rainbow in the cloud, <a href="3927/genesis_9_14.htm">Genesis 9:14-17</a>; by the glorious colors of the dawn; and in general by the continual renewal of everything in the body by means of the chyle and the animal spirit and the blood thence produced, whose purification from matter that is no longer of use, and renewal, and as it were, regeneration, are perpetual.</p>
<p>
[3] If we consider the humblest things on earth, an image of regeneration is presented in the wonderful transformation of silk-worms and many other caterpillars into nymphs and butterflies, and in the transformation of other insects which in time are furnished with wings. In addition to these examples others of a more trivial nature might be mentioned, as the fondness of certain birds of plunging into water for the sake of washing and cleansing themselves, after which they return, like nightingales, to their songs. In a word, the whole world, from first things to last, is full of representations and types of regeneration. </p>
