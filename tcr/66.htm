<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第66节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>66</b>.要知道，耶和华神在当中的灵界太阳所发出的万物都与人相关。结果，凡存在于灵界中的事物都结合成一个人形，并在其核心呈现为人形。因此，在灵界，显为可见的一切物体都是人体的代表。那里可见的各种动物则是天使的爱之情感和随之思维的样式。那里同样有可见的树林、花园和草地。我曾被允许得知这样或那样的物体代表哪种情感。奇妙的是，当他们的至内在视觉被打开时，他们能在这些物体中认出自己的形像。这是因为，每个人都是自己的爱和随之自己的思维。由于在每个人里面，源于他们的情感和思维各种各样，极其复杂，其中有些与这个动物有关，有些与那个动物有关，所以，这些情感的形像以这种方式变得明显。有关该主题的更多说明可见于下面有关创造的那几节内容（75－80节）。这些事实也证实了这个真理，即创世的目的就是来自人类的天使天堂，所以这目的就是人，神能居于人里面，如同居于自己的容器中。这就是为何人被造为神性秩序形式的原因。</p>

66. 有必要知道, 一切從心靈世界太陽(耶和華上帝在其中)發出的, 都與人有關。因此在心靈世界形成的一切合併成一個人形; 在最深層次, 它們自己呈現那個形狀。結果就是, 那裡形成的一切物體在眼前都是人的象徵。
<p>心靈世界中有各樣的動物。它們是天人心中仁愛的情感以及因情感而產生的思維所對應的形像。那裡的樹林,花園,草地和牧場也是如此。天人也被賦予洞察力, 用以明白是什麼情感,以及各樣的物體代表什麼。令人驚奇的是, 當他們的內在視覺被打開時, 他們能在這些事物中認出自己的形像。會發生這些, 是因為所有人其實都是他們自己的愛欲和各自的思維。每個人的情感和思維各不相同,複雜多變; 有一些人在情感方面體現為某種動物, 有一些體現為另一種。因此, 眾天人的不同情感就按這種方式形成不同的形像。關於這點, 在關於創造的那一部分內容中(<a href="75.htm">75-80</a>節)會有更詳細的說明。
<p>從這一切的真相中可清楚看出, 上帝創世的目的就是準備一個從人類而來的天國——人成為上帝居住的安息之地。這就是為何人被造為聖規的形式。 </p>

66. It is important to know that everything that radiates from the sun around Jehovah God in the spiritual world relates to humanness. Therefore all things that take shape in that world combine to make a human form, and at their deepest level present that form themselves. As a result, all the objects that take shape there before the eyes are symbolic of a human being.
<p>There are animals of every kind in that world. They are likenesses of the feelings of love and the resulting thoughts that angels have. The same goes for the tree gardens, flower gardens, and lawns and meadows there. The angels are also given insights about what feeling this or that object represents. Surprisingly, when their inner sight is opened up they recognize an image of themselves in the things around them. This happens because all people are their own love and their own thought. In everyone there are a variety and multiplicity of feelings and thoughts, some of which relate to the feeling embodied in one animal, and some to the feeling embodied in another. Therefore images of the angels' feelings take shape in that way. There will be more on this topic in the part of this chapter on creation [75-80].
<p>From all this the truth becomes clear that the purpose of creation was [to provide for] an angelic heaven from the human race - humankind as a resting place for God to inhabit. And this is why human beings were created as forms of the divine design. </p>

66. It should be known that all things emanating from the sun of the spiritual world, in the midst of which is Jehovah God, answer to the human form. Consequently whatever comes into existence in that world combines to make a human form, and in its inmost parts exhibits that. Thus all the objects displayed to view there are representative of the human body. All kinds of animals are to be seen there, and these are likenesses of the angels' affections of love and so of their thoughts. Equally to be seen there are woods, flower-gardens and greensward. I have been permitted to know which affection this or that object represents. An extraordinary thing, when their inmost sight is opened, they recognise their own image in them. This is because every person is his own love and so his own thought. So since the affections and thoughts derived from them are varied and complex in the case of each person, some of them answering to the affection indicated by one animal, some to that indicated by another, this is why their affections are made manifest in this way. More will be seen on this subject in the following section on creation [<a href="75.htm">75-80</a>]. These facts also demonstrate this truth, that the end in view in creation was a heaven of angels drawn from the human race; consequently the end was man, in whom God could dwell as in something made to receive Him. This is the cause of man being created to be a form for the Divine order. </p>

66. It must be understood that all things that proceed from the sun of the spiritual world, in the midst of which is Jehovah God, have relation to man; and therefore whatever things come forth in that world conspire towards the human form, and exhibit that form in their inmosts; thus all objects there that are presented to the sight are representative of man. Animals of all kinds are seen there, and they are likenesses of the affections of love and consequent thoughts of the angels; and the same is true of the trees, flowers, and green fields there; and what affection this or that object represents the angels are permitted to know; and what is wonderful, when their inmost sight is opened, they recognize their own image in them; and this takes place because every man is his own love and his own thought therefrom. And because in every man affections and thoughts therefrom are various and manifold, some of them relating to the affection of one animal and some to that of another, the images of these affections become manifest in this way. But of this more will be seen in the section on Creation [n. <a href="78.htm">78</a>. From all this the truth is seen that the end of creation was an angelic heaven from the human race, and consequently man, in whom God can dwell as in His receptacle; and this is the reason why man was created a form of Divine order. </p>

66. It should be known that all things which proceed from the Sun of the spiritual world, in the midst of which is Jehovah God, declare man, and consequently that all things in that world have a tendency towards the human form and exhibit it in their inmost parts; therefore all objects there which appear to the eye are representatives of man. Animals of all kinds appear in that world, and these are likenesses of the affections of love, and consequently of the thoughts of the angels. There are woods, flower beds and green fields in that world; and it is granted to the angels to know what spiritual quality this or that object represents, and what is very wonderful, when their inmost sight is opened, they recognize in these things an image of something in themselves. This is because every man is his own love and consequently his own thought; and because affections and consequently thoughts with every man are varied and manifold, some of them representing the affection of one animal and others that of another, therefore the likenesses of their affections are thus exhibited; but more concerning this subject will be shown in the subsequent section on Creation. From these considerations the truth is evident that the end of Creation was an angelic heaven from the human race, and consequently man himself, in whom God could dwell as in a recipient of Himself. It is for this reason that man was created a form of Divine order. </p>

66. Sciendum est, quod omnia, quae procedunt ex Sole Mundi spiritualis, in cujus medio est Jehovah Deus, referant hominem, et quod inde quaecumque in illo Mundo existunt, conspirent ad formam humanam, et illam in intimis suis sistant, unde omnia objecta, quae sistuntur oculis ibi, sunt repraesentativa hominis: apparent ibi omnis generis Animalia, et haec sunt Similitudines affectionum amoris et inde cogitationum angelorum; pariter arboreta, floreta et vireta ibi; et datum est scire, quam affectionem hoc et illud objectum repraesentat: et, quod mirabile est, quando illis aperitur visus intimus, cognoscunt suam imaginem in illis; et hoc fit, quia omnis homo est suus amor et inde sua cogitatio; et quia affectiones et inde cogitationes apud unumquemvis hominem sunt variae et multiplices, et aliquae illarum referunt hujus animalis affectionem, et aliquae alterius, ideo sistuntur affectionum illorum imagines ita; sed de his plura videbuntur in Membro sequente de Creatione. Ex his etiam patet veritas, quod finis creationis fuerit Coelum Angelicum ex Humano Genere, consequenter Homo, in quo Deus ut in suo Receptaculo posset habitare: inde est causa, quod homo creatus sit forma Divini Ordinis. </p>
