793. 死后, 人仍是活生生的人, 和以前一样, 尽管如此, 那时他却不为肉眼所见, 这一点可通过被亚伯拉罕, 夏甲, 基甸, 但以理, 一些先知所见天人的例子看出来, 也可通过主的坟墓旁所看到的天人的例子看出来, 以及后来, 通过启示录中约翰所描述的在很多场合所见天人的例子看出来。 最重要的是, 主自己证实了这一点, 祂通过触摸和吃饭来表明祂是一个人 (Man), 然而却在祂的门徒眼前消失。 谁会如此愚蠢, 以至于不承认祂就是一个人 (Man), 尽管祂不见了? 祂的门徒看见祂, 是因为那时他们的灵眼被打开了; 当灵眼被打开时, 灵界的事物就会象尘世的事物那样清晰地显现出来。 世人与灵人的不同之处在于, 灵人披戴一个实质身体, 而世人披戴一个物质身体, 他的实质身体就在这物质身体中; 实质人看实质人, 就象物质人看物质人一样清楚。 但由于物质与实质之间的差异, 实质人看不见物质人, 物质人也看不见实质人, 这种差异的性质可以描述出来, 但几句话说不清楚。 </p>

793. We are still human beings after we die, even though we are no longer visible to the physical eyes of people still in the world. This is clear from the angels that were seen by Abraham, Hagar, Gideon, Daniel, and some of the prophets. This is also clear from the angels that were seen in the Lord's tomb, and from the angels that were seen a number of times by John, as he says in the Book of Revelation. It is especially clear from the Lord himself, who showed that he was still human by touching people and eating things; yet he also disappeared from before their eyes. But who could be so deranged as to think that the Lord stopped being human just because he disappeared?
<p>People were able to see the Lord because the eyes of their spirit were opened at the time. When the eyes of our spirit are opened, things that are in the spiritual world appear to us just as clearly as things that are in the physical world. The difference between people in the physical world and people in the spiritual world is that people in the spiritual world are clothed in a substantial body, whereas people in the physical world are clothed in a material body that has a substantial body inside it. Substantial people see other substantial people just as clearly as physical people see other physical people. Because of the difference between what is physical and what is substantial, however, substantial people cannot see physical people and physical people cannot see substantial people. I could describe the nature of the difference between the two, but it would take too many words. </p>

793. A person is just as much a person after death, although he is then invisible to the eyes of the material body. This can be established from the cases of the angels seen by Abraham, Hagar, Gideon, Daniel and some of the prophets, from the angels seen in the Lord's tomb, And afterwards on many occasions by John, as he describes in Revelation. Above all, this is proved by the Lord Himself, who showed by touch and by eating that He was a human being, although He vanished from their sight. Can anyone be so crazy as not to acknowledge that, although invisible, He was just as much a human being? The reason they saw Him was that the eyes of their spirit were opened; and when these are opened things in the spiritual world appear just as plain as things in the natural world. The difference between people in the natural world and those in the spiritual world is that those in the spiritual world are clothed with a substantial body, but those in the natural world are clothed with a material body. This, however, has the substantial body within it, and a substantial person can see another one just as clearly as a material person can see another one. But a substantial person cannot see a material one, nor a material person a substantial one, on account of the difference between the material and the substantial. This is capable of being described, but not briefly. </p>

793. That man is as much a man after death as before, although he is not then visible to the eyes of the material body, can be seen from the appearance of the angels to Abraham, Hagar, Gideon, Daniel, and some of the prophets, also in the Lord's sepulchre, and frequently afterwards to John as related in the Apocalypse; but especially from the Lord Himself, who showed by touch and by eating that He was a Man, and yet became invisible to the eyes of His disciples. Who can be so foolish as not to acknowledge that although He was invisible He was just as much a Man? His disciples saw Him because the eyes of their spirits were then opened; and when these are opened, the things of the spiritual world appear as clearly as those of the natural world. The difference between man in the natural world and man in the spiritual world is, that man in the spiritual world is clothed with a substantial body, but man in the natural world with a material body, within which is his substantial body; and the substantial man sees the substantial man just as clearly as the material man sees the material. But the substantial man cannot see the material man, nor the material man the substantial, because of the difference between what is material and what is substantial, the nature of which difference can be defined, but not in few words. </p>

793. That a man after death is as much a man as before, although he does not then appear to the eyes of the material body, may be evident from the angels seen by Abraham, Hagar, Gideon, Daniel and by some of the prophets; and also from those seen in the Lord's sepulchre, and from those seen many times afterwards by John, as he relates in the Revelation Especially is it evident from the Lord Himself, who showed by touch and by eating that He was a Man, and yet became invisible to the eyes of His disciples. Would any one be so foolish as not to acknowledge that although He became invisible He was still just as much a man? The reason why the disciples saw Him was that their spiritual eyes were at that time opened; and when these are opened, the objects in the spiritual world are seen as clearly as those in the natural world. The difference between a man in the natural world and a man in the spiritual world, is that the latter is clothed with a substantial body, but the former with a material body, in which inwardly is his substantial body; and a substantial man sees a substantial man as clearly as a material man sees a material man. A substantial man, however, cannot see a material man, nor can a material man see a substantial man, owing to the difference between matter and substance. The nature of this difference can be described, but not in a few words. </p>

793. Quod homo sit aeque homo post mortem, tametsi tunc coram oculis materialis corporis non apparet, constare potest ex Angelis visis Abrahamo, Hagari, Guideoni, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Danieli, et quibusdam Prophetis, ex Angelis visis in Sepulchro Domini, et postea multoties Johanni, de quibus in APOCALYPSI; cumprimis ex Ipso Domino, qui quod esset Homo, ostendit per tactum et per esum, et tamen coram oculis illorum inconspicuus factus est; quis potest ita delirare, ut non agnoscat, quin, tametsi inconspicuus, aeque homo fuerit: Quod viderint Ipsum, erat causa, quia tunc aperti sunt oculi Spiritus illorum, et cum hi aperiuntur, apparent illa, quae in Mundo spirituali sunt, aeque clare, quemadmodum illa, quae in Mundo Naturali. Differentia inter hominem in Mundo naturali, et hominem in Mundo spirituali est, quod hic homo Corpore substantiali indutus sit, ille autem Corpore materiali, in quo intus est corpus ejus substantiale, et homo substantialis videt hominem substantialem aeque clare, ut homo materialis videt hominem materialem: sed non potest homo substantialis videre hominem materialem, nec homo materialis hominem substantialem, propter differentiam inter materiale et substantiale, quae qualis est, describi potest, sed non paucis.<p>
