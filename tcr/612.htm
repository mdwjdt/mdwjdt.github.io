612. 人生来就倾向于各种邪恶, 来自这倾向的欲望紧随其后, 并且只要他在自由中, 还是会作恶。 因为他生来就渴望控制别人, 占有他人财物, 这两种欲望粉碎了对邻之爱, 然后他仇恨反对自己的每个人, 其仇恨又呼出内心怀有杀机的报复。 由于同样的原因, 他毫不在乎通奸, 也不在乎如盗窃之类的抢劫, 以及包含假见证的亵渎。 若不把这些事放在眼里, 他内心里就是一个无神论者。 这就是人生来的模样, 由此清楚可知, 人天生就是一个微型地狱。 既然人就其内在心智而言是属灵的, 和动物不同, 因而他是为天堂而生的, 然而, 如前所述, 其属世或外在人就是一个微型地狱, 那么可知, 天堂不可能被植入地狱, 除非这地狱被移走。 </p>

</h4>
<p>
612. From the day we are born we have an inclination toward evils of every kind. Because of that inclination we yearn for these evils. If we have the freedom, we also do them. From birth, we long to control other people and to own what belongs to them. These two longings tear to pieces any love we might have for our neighbor. They induce us to hate anyone who opposes us; that hatred leads us to desire revenge; and that desire for revenge inwardly cherishes the idea of our opponent's death. The same forces also lead us to think it is perfectly acceptable to commit adultery, to take things by secret acts of thievery, and to slander people, which is bearing false witness. People who think these things are acceptable are atheists at heart. This is the nature we are born with. Clearly then, we are born a hell in miniature.
<p>Nevertheless, unlike animals, we are born with inner levels of mind that are spiritual. We are born for heaven. Because our earthly or outer self is a hell in miniature, as just noted, it follows that heaven cannot be planted in that hell; that hell must be moved out of the way. </p>

612. From birth everyone has a propensity to evils of every kind, and this makes him long for them and do them so far as he is free to do so. For from birth he longs to control others and possess other people's property, the two things which shatter love toward the neighbour. Then he hates anyone who opposes him, and his hatred breathes revenge, a feeling inwardly nursing thoughts of murder. This too is why he makes light of adultery and cheating, which is secret theft, as well as of blasphemy, which includes false witness. Anyone who pays no heed to all these is an atheist at heart.<p>That is what a person is like from birth, and it is plain from this that he is a hell on the smallest scale. Now since a person is born, as far as the interiors of his mind are concerned, to be spiritual, as animals are not, and since he is consequently born to go to heaven, yet his natural or external man is, as I have just said, a hell on the smallest scale, it follows that heaven cannot be planted in hell, but this must be removed. </p>

612. Man inclines by birth to evils of every kind and from that inclination lusts after them, and so far as he is in freedom he also does them; for by birth he lusts after dominion over others, and to possess the goods of others, which two lusts cut asunder love to the neighbor, and then man hates everyone who opposes him, and from hatred breathes revenge which inwardly cherishes murder. For the same reason he thinks nothing of adulteries, nothing of such robbery as secret theft, nothing of blasphemies, which include false witness; and he who thinks nothing of these things, is in heart an atheist. Such is man by birth; from which it is clear that he is from birth a hell in miniature. Inasmuch then, as man, in respect to the interiors of his mind, is born spiritual, as beasts are not, and consequently is born for heaven, and yet, as has been said, his natural or external man is a miniature hell, it follows that a heaven cannot be implanted in this hell, unless the hell is removed. </p>

612. Man by birth is inclined to evils of every kind; and from his inclination he lusts after them, and as far as he is at liberty, he even commits them; for by birth he lusts to rule over others, and to possess their goods. These two lusts destroy love towards the neighbor; and then a man hates every one that opposes him, and from this hatred he longs for revenge, which inwardly cherishes murder. For this reason also he makes light of adultery, pilfering or secret theft, and blasphemy or false witness; and whoever makes light of such evils is at heart an atheist. Such is man by birth, and, therefore, it is evident that from birth he is a hell in miniature. Now man, unlike the beasts, is born spiritual as to the interiors of his mind, and consequently born for heaven; yet his natural or external man, as has just been stated, is a hell in miniature; it follows, therefore, that heaven cannot be implanted where hell is, unless this is first removed. </p>

612. Homo a nativitate inclinat ad omnis generis mala, et ex inclinatione concupiscit illa, et quantum in libero est etiam facit illa, nam a nativitate concupiscit dominari super alios, et possidere bona aliorum, quae duo discindunt amorem erga proximum, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
et tunc odio habet quemcunque qui se opponit, et ex odio spirat vindictam, quae intus fovet necem; inde quoque est, quod nihili faciat adulteria, nihili depraedationes quae sunt clandestina furta, et nihili blasphemias quae etiam sunt falsa testimonia, et qui haec et illa nihili facit, ille etiam corde atheus est; talis est homo a nativitate; ex quibus patet, quod ex hac sit in minima effigie infernum. Nunc quia homo quoad interiora mentis suae natus est spiritualis, secus ac bestiae, consequenter natus ad coelum, et tamen naturalis seu externus ejus homo, est ut dictum est, in minima effigie infernum, sequitur quod coelum non implantari possit inferno, nisi hoc removeatur.<p>
