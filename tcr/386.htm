<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>386</b>.记事二：<br />一天清晨，我一醒来就看见两位天使从天上下来，一位来自南方，一位来自东方。他们都驾着马车，拉车的马儿是白色的。南方天堂天使所驾的马车银光闪闪，而东方天堂天使所驾的马车则金光灿灿；他们手持的缰绳仿佛闪烁着黎明的火焰色光芒。这是我从远处所看到的两位天使的形像，但等到他们靠近时，就不是这样了，而是天使的形像，也就是人的形像。来自东方天堂的这一位身穿闪亮的紫袍，而来自南方天堂的这一位则身穿蓝袍。当抵达天堂下面的低地时，他们跑向对方，仿佛奋勇争先，然后彼此拥抱亲吻。我听说他们在世时是挚友，不过如今一个在东方天堂，一个在南方天堂。那些通过主而有爱之人住在东方天堂，而那些通过主而有智慧之人则住在南方天堂。他们先谈了会儿各自天堂的辉煌，然后转向这个话题：就其本质而言，天堂是爱还是智慧。他们很快达成共识：二者相互依存。于是，他们讨论哪一个是对方的起源。<br />来自智慧天堂来的天使问另一位：“什么是爱？”对方回答说：“由显为太阳的主所产生的爱是赋予天使和人类生命的热，因此是他们生命的存在；爱的衍生物被称作情感，由此产生感知，因而思维；由此可知，智慧就其起源而言，就是爱，因此，思维就其起源而言，是属于那爱的情感；按照它们的正确顺序深入思考这些衍生物，不难发现，思维无非是情感所取的形式；这一事实为不人知的原因在于，思维处在光中，而情感处在热中，因此人们会反思思维，却不会反思情感。思维无非是人的爱之情感所取的形式，这一点可从言语清楚看出来，因为言语无非是声音的一种形式；这种相似之处还在于，声音对应于情感，言语对应于思维；所以，情感发出声音，思维将其清晰表达为话语。若我们说：‘把声音从言语那里拿走，言语还剩下什么呢？同样，把情感从思维那里拿走，思维还剩下什么呢？’这一点也会变得明显。由此清楚可知，爱是智慧的全部，因此天堂的本质是爱，它们的形成是智慧；或也可说，天堂是圣爱的产物，它们通过藉着圣智的圣爱形成。因此，如我先前所说，这二者相互依存。”<br />就在这时，与我同在的一个新灵听到这些话后，就问仁与信的情形是否也如此，因为仁属于情感，信属于思维。“是的，完全一样，”这位天使答道，“信无非是仁的形式，就象言语是声音的形式一样。信也由仁形成，如同言语由声音形成。在天堂，我们知道是如何形成的，但我没时间在此解释。”天使又补充说：“我所说的信是指属灵之信，其中的生命和灵经由仁唯独来自主，因为仁是属灵的，信正是经由仁才变得属灵。所以，无仁之信是纯属世之信，这样的信是死的，因为它与纯属世的情感相结合，而属世的情感无非是欲望。”<br />两位天使以属灵的方式谈论了这个话题，属灵的语言包含成千上万种属世语言所无法表达的事物，奇妙的是，这些事物甚至无法属世的思维观念。谈完这些话题后，两位天使离开了；当他们离开，各自回到自己的天堂时，有星星显现在他们头部的周围；当他们离开我一段距离后，我又和先前一样，看见他们在马车里。</p>

386. 第二個經歷:
<p>一天早晨剛醒來, 我見天上來兩位天人, 一位自南方, 一位自東面。他們都駕馬車而來, 幾匹馬都是白色的。南邊來的天人所駕馬車閃爍銀光, 東邊來的馬車發金光。他們手持的韁繩, 如同朝陽的光輝。兩位天人遠看如此, 當他們靠近時, 看上去就不是馬車了, 而是天人的外形, 也就是人的外形。東邊來的那位身穿發光的紫色衣裳, 南邊那位著天藍色衣裳。
<p>當他們抵達天國下方的地面時, 跑向對方, 好像爭著看誰先到, 然後相互擁抱親吻。我聽說他們在世是摯友, 不過如今一個在天國的東邊, 一個在南邊。東邊是愛主之人的聚集地, 南面是智者之地。
<p>他們各自談論自己所在天國的一些體驗之後, 轉向這個話題:天國的本質, 是仁愛抑或智慧？不過, 很快達成共識:二者相互依存。於是, 他們討論哪一個才是另一個的根源？
<p>[2]從智慧天國來的天人問另一位:"什麼是仁愛？"
<p>另一位天人回答:"仁愛源自主, 如同熱源自於太陽, 給天人與人類帶來生命, 是他們生命的根本。由仁愛派生的, 稱為情感, 由此產生感知, 因此產生思維。由此得出, 智慧源自于仁愛, 思維源自於情感(情感與仁愛相關)。思考各自派生的次序, 可看得出:思維只不過是情感所表現的形式。這個事實還不為眾人所知, 因為思維存在於光中, 而情感存在於熱中, 因此人們只是考慮到思維而不是情感。
<p>"思維只不過是情感的表現形式, 可以用言語來形容, 因為言語只不過是聲音的形式而已。事實上, 聲音對應於情感, 言辭對應于思維。情感產生聲音, 思維表達言辭。
<p>"還可由此看得更清楚:如果某人說'將聲音從言辭拿走。'言辭還有什麼留下呢？同理, 將情感從思維取走, 思維還剩下什麼呢？
<p>"於是很明顯, 智慧中最重要的組成部分是仁愛, 因此天國的本質是仁愛, 其形式是智慧。或者換個說法, 諸天國是神性之仁愛(聖仁)的產物, 由神性之仁愛,通過神性智慧(聖智)而成型。因此, 正如我們之前所說, 二者相互依存。"
<p>[3]此時, 有一個新到靈界的靈在我邊上, 當聽到這些話後, 問道:"那麼義與信的關係是不是也是如此？因為義與情感相關, 信與思維相關？"
<p>"完全相同, "天人回答:"信不是別的, 只是義的形式, 恰似言辭與聲音的關係。事實上, 信由義形成, 正如言辭由聲音形成。在天國中, 我們甚至知道形成的過程如何, 只是在此沒那麼多時間來解釋。"
<p>天人接著說:"當我說到'信'時, 指的是屬靈之信, 其中有藉著義,全然來自主的生命與靈; 因為義是屬靈的, 信通過義而屬靈。因此, 無義之信是完全屬世之信, 完全屬世之信是死的; 只是與純粹屬世的情感相聯, 除了肉欲, 沒別的什麼。"
<p>[4]二位天人以屬靈的方式來解釋這些觀點。屬靈的言語中包含著超越屬世語言所能表達的無數差別; 令人驚奇的是, 屬世的思維甚至無法想像這些差別。
<p>談完這些話題後, 天人離開了。當他們正離開, 各回各自的天國的時候, 有星星顯現在他們頭部的周圍。當他們離我遠去時, 我又看到他們在馬車之中, 如之前所見。 </p>

386. The second memorable occurrence. One morning after I woke up, I saw two angels coming down from heaven. One was coming from the southern part of heaven and the other from the eastern part. They were both in carriages drawn by white horses. The carriage that was carrying the angel from the southern part of heaven was shining like silver. The carriage that was carrying the angel from the eastern part of heaven was shining like gold. The reins the angels were holding in their hands were flashing with a fiery light like the rising sun. That is how the two angels looked from far away. When they came closer, however, they no longer looked as though they were in carriages. They were simply in their own angelic form, which is human. The one who came from the eastern part of heaven was wearing shining clothes that were deep red. The one who came from the southern part of heaven was wearing clothes that were sky blue.
<p>When they reached the lower regions below the heavens, they ran toward one another as if each were trying to be first [to reach the other]. They hugged and kissed each other. I heard that when these two angels lived in the world they formed a bond of deep friendship. Yet now one was in the eastern part of heaven and the other was in the southern part. The eastern heaven holds angels who focus on love from the Lord; the southern heaven holds angels who focus on wisdom from the Lord.
<p>After the angels spent a while talking about the magnificent things in their heavens, a question came up in their conversation about whether the essence of heaven is love or wisdom. They agreed right away that each one relates to the other; but they were discussing which one was the origin of the other.
</p>
<p>
[2] The angel from the heaven of wisdom asked the other angel, "What is love?"
<p>The other angel replied, "The love that originates from the Lord as a sun is the vital heat that angels and people have - it is the underlying reality of their lives. The derivatives of love are called feelings. Feelings produce perceptions and therefore thoughts. It flows from this that wisdom starts out as love, and therefore thought starts out as the feeling related to that love. Looking at the derivatives in sequence makes it possible to see that thought is nothing but the form of the feeling. This is not generally known, because thoughts exist in light but feelings exist in heat, and therefore people reflect on their thoughts but not on their feelings.
<p>"The fact that thought is nothing but the form of a feeling related to some love can be illustrated by the fact that speech is nothing but the form of sound. In fact, sound corresponds to feeling and speech corresponds to thought. Feelings make sounds, and thoughts speak.
<p>"This point would become crystal clear if someone were to say, 'Take the sound out of your speech. ' Would there be any speech left? Also, Take the feeling out of your thinking. Would there be any thinking left?
<p>"Clearly then, the most important ingredient in wisdom is love. Therefore the essence of the heavens is love and their form is wisdom. Or to put it another way, the heavens exist as the result of divine love and they take shape as the result of divine love acting through divine wisdom. Therefore, as we said before, each one does indeed relate to the other. "
</p>
<p>
[3] At the time there was a spirit with me who had recently arrived [in the spiritual world], who heard all this and asked, "Is it the same for goodwill and faith, since goodwill relates to feeling and faith relates to thinking?"
<p>"It is absolutely the same," the angel replied. "Faith is nothing but a formation of goodwill, exactly as speech is nothing but a formation of sound. In fact, faith is formed from goodwill in the same way that speech is formed from sound. Up in heaven we even know the mode of formation, but there is no time to lay that out now. "
<p>The angel added, "When I say 'faith,' I mean a spiritual faith whose life and spirit come solely from the Lord by way of goodwill, since goodwill is spiritual, and faith is spiritual through goodwill. Faith without goodwill, then, is a mere earthly faith, and mere earthly faith is dead; it unites itself to mere earthly feelings, which are nothing but cravings. "
</p>
<p>
[4] The angels expressed these thoughts in a spiritual way. Spiritual speech includes thousands of nuances that earthly language cannot express. In fact, surprising to say, those nuances are not even thinkable with the ideas of earthly thought.
<p>After the angels had said all this they left. As they were going back to their own heavens, stars appeared around their heads. When they got farther away from me, they looked as though they were in carriages again, as before. </p>

386. The second experience.<p>One morning on waking from sleep I saw two angels coming down from heaven, one from the south, the other from the east of heaven; they were both in chariots to which were harnessed white horses. The chariot in which the angel from the south of heaven rode shone as if of silver, and that in which the angel from the east of heaven rode shone as if of gold; and the reins they held in their hands shone as if touched by the flame-coloured light of dawn. That was how the two angels looked to me at a distance; but when they came near, they did not appear in a chariot, but in the form of angels, which is the human form. The one coming from the east of heaven wore a shining purple robe; the one from the south of heaven a violet robe. When these angels reached the lower levels beneath the heavens each ran towards the other, as if racing to see who could arrive first, and embraced and kissed each other.<p>I was told that the two angels had been very close friends during their lives in the world, but one was now in the eastern heaven, the other in the southern one. The eastern heaven is the home of those who have love from the Lord, the southern heaven is that of those who have wisdom from the Lord. After talking for some time about the splendours of their heavens, their talk turned to this topic: whether heaven in its essence is love or whether it is wisdom. They agreed at once that one depends on the other, but they discussed which was the origin of the other.</p>
<p>
[2] The angel from the heaven of wisdom asked the other: 'What is love?' He replied that love arising from the Lord as a sun is the heat which gives life to angels and men, so it is the Being of their life; and the things derived from love are called affections, and it is these which give rise to perceptions and thus to thoughts. 'From this flows the consequence that wisdom is by its origin love, consequently thought is by its origin an affection belonging to that love. It can be seen by considering the derivatives in their proper sequence that thought is nothing but the form taken by affection. This fact is unknown because thoughts are exposed to light, but affections to heat, so that people reflect on thoughts, but not on affections. Thought being nothing but the form taken by an affection belonging to some love or other can also be illustrated by speech, since this is nothing but a form of sound; it is also similar in that sound corresponds to affection, and speech to thought, so that affection makes a sound, and thought articulates it into words. This can also be made obvious, if we say: "Take sound away from speech - is there anything left of speech? Likewise take affection away from thought - is there anything left of thought?" It is now plain from this that love is the whole of wisdom, and consequently the essence of the heavens is love, and their coming-into-being is wisdom; or what is the same thing, the heavens are the product of Divine love, and they come into existence from Divine love by means of Divine wisdom. Therefore, as I said before, one depends upon the other.'</p>
<p>
[3] At that time I had with me a recently arrived spirit, who on hearing this asked whether it was similar with charity and faith, since charity belongs to affection, and faith to thought.<p>'Yes, exactly similar,' replied the angel. 'Faith is nothing but the form of charity, just as speech is of sound. Faith is also formed by charity, as speech is by sound. We in heaven know how this forming occurs, but I have not time to explain it here. By faith,' he added, 'I mean spiritual faith, in which life and spirit come solely from the Lord by means of charity, for this is spiritual and the means by which faith is acquired. Faith without charity therefore is purely natural faith, and this is lifeless faith; it also links itself with purely natural affection, which is nothing but longing.'</p>
<p>
[4] The angels were talking on this subject spiritually, and spiritual speech includes thousands of things beyond the power of natural speech to express, and remarkably enough these things cannot enter into the ideas of natural thought. After talking on both these subjects the angels went away, and as they receded, each towards his own heaven, stars appeared round their heads; and when they were at some distance from me I saw them again in chariots, as before. </p>

386. Second Memorable Relation: <p>One morning on awaking from sleep, I saw two angels descending from heaven, one from the southern part of heaven and one from the eastern, both in chariots to which were harnessed white horses. The chariot in which the angel from the southern heaven rode shone like silver; while the chariot in which the angel from the east rode shone like gold; and the reins which they held in their hands gleamed like the flaming light of the dawn. Thus did those two angels appear to me from afar; but when they came near they did not appear in chariots, but in their own angelic form, which is the human form. The one that came from the eastern part of heaven was clad in a resplendent purple garment, and the one from the southern part of heaven in a violet colored garment. When they reached the lower regions beneath the heavens, they ran toward each other as if striving who should be first, and embraced and kissed each other. <p>I heard that these two angels while they lived in the world had been united by an interior friendship, but that now one dwelt in the eastern and the other in the southern heaven. In the eastern heaven are those who are in love from the Lord, but in the southern heaven those who are in wisdom from the Lord. <p>When they had talked awhile about the magnificent things in their heavens, this point arose in their conversation, whether, in its essence, heaven is love or is wisdom. They agreed at once that each belongs to the other, but they questioned which of them was the source.
</p>
<p>
[2] The angel from the heaven of wisdom asked the other, "What is love?" And he replied that love originating in the Lord as a sun is the heat of life of men and angels, and therefore is the esse of their life; and that the derivations of love are called affections, and through them are produced perceptions and thus thoughts; from which it follows that wisdom in its origin is love, consequently that thought in its origin is an affection of that love; and it can be seen from these derivations examined in their order that thought is nothing but a form of affection; and the reason why this is not known is that thoughts are in light, but affections in heat, and therefore men reflect upon thoughts, but not upon affections. That thought is nothing but a form of the affection of one's love, can be made clear from speech, as being merely a form of sound, and this likeness still further holds good in that the tone of the voice corresponds to affection, and speech to thought; so that it is the affection that gives tone, and the thought that speaks. This will also become obvious if it is asked whether anything of speech remains if tone is taken from it; and so, too, whether anything of thought remains if affection is taken from it. From this it is clear that love is the all of wisdom, consequently that the essence of the heavens is love, and their existence wisdom; or what is the same, that the heavens have their being from the Divine love, and their existence from the Divine love through the Divine wisdom; therefore, as before said, each belongs to the other.
</p>
<p>
[3] There was then with me a newly arrived spirit, who, hearing these remarks, asked whether it was the same with charity and faith, since charity belongs to affection and faith to thought. <p>The angel replied, "It is precisely the same; faith is nothing but the form of charity, just as speech is a form of sound. Moreover, faith is formed from charity, as speech is formed from sound. In heaven we know how it is formed, but there is not time to explain it now." <p>He added, "By faith I mean spiritual faith, the life and spirit in which are solely from the Lord through charity, for charity is spiritual, and it is through charity that faith becomes spiritual; therefore faith apart from charity is a merely natural faith, and such faith is dead, for it is conjoined with merely natural affection, which is nothing but lust."
</p>
<p>
[4] The angels spoke of these things spiritually, and spiritual language embraces thousands of things which natural language cannot express, and, what is wonderful, which cannot even fall into the ideas of natural thought. <p>After this conversation the angels departed; and as they withdrew, each to his own heaven, stars appeared about their heads; and when they were some distance from me, they again appeared, as before, to be in chariots. </p>

386. The second experience. On awaking from sleep early one morning I saw two angels descending from heaven, one from the southern and the other from the eastern quarter, each in a chariot drawn by white horses. The chariot of the angel from the south shone like silver, and that of the angel from the east like gold, and the reins which they held in their hands glowed as with the rosy light of the dawn. Thus did these two angels appear to me at a distance; but when they came near, they did not appear in chariots, but they were in their own angelic, that is, human form. The one from the east of heaven was clad in a resplendent purple robe, and the one from the south in a garment of blue. When they reached the lower regions beneath the heavens, they ran to meet each other, as if striving which should be first, and embraced and kissed each other. I learned that these two angels, while they lived in the world, had been united by a bond of interior friendship; but now one was in the eastern, and the other in the southern heaven. In the eastern heaven dwell those who are in love from the Lord, but in the southern those who are in wisdom from Him. After they had talked for some time on the splendors of their respective heavens, their conversation turned upon this: Whether heaven, in its essence, is love or wisdom. They agreed upon this, that the one pertains to the other, but they discussed which was the original.</p>
<p>
[2] The angel from the heaven of wisdom then asked the other, "What is love?" to which he replied: "Love arising from the Lord as the Sun, is the heat of the life of angels and men, and consequently the being (esse) of their life. The derivatives of love are called affections, and from these are produced perceptions and thus thoughts. Hence it follows that wisdom in its origin is love, and consequently that thought in its origin is the affection of that love; and it may be seen, from examining these derivatives in their order, that thought is nothing but the form of affection. This is not generally known because thoughts are in light, but affections in heat; therefore men reflect upon their thoughts but not upon their affections. That thought is nothing but the form of the affection of some love, may also be illustrated by speech, which is but the form of sound. This is an exact illustration, because sound, or tone, corresponds to affection, and speech to thought; therefore affection gives rise to the sounds, and thought to the words, of the speaker. This becomes clear when it is asked, what remains of speech if sound is taken away, and of thought if affection is absent? It is evident then, that love is the all of wisdom, and consequently that the essence of the heavens is love and their existence is wisdom; or, what is the same thing, the heavens have their being from the Divine Love, and exist from the Divine Love by means of the Divine Wisdom; and therefore, as was said before, the one pertains to the other."</p>
<p>
[3] There was standing near me at that time a spirit newly-arrived who, hearing this, inquired whether the same was true of charity and faith, since charity has relation to affection, and faith to thought. The angel replied, "Yes. Faith is but the form of charity, just as speech is the form of sound. Moreover, faith is formed from charity, as speech is formed from sound. We in heaven know how this is brought about, but there is no leisure to explain it now. By faith, however," he added, "I mean spiritual faith, which alone has life and spirit from the Lord by means of charity; for charity is spiritual and by its means faith also is spiritual. Thus faith without charity is merely natural faith, and this faith is dead; for it is united with merely natural affection, which is nothing but superficial desire."</p>
<p>
[4] The angels conversed on these matters spiritually, and spiritual speech embraces thousands of things which natural speech cannot express, and, what is wonderful, cannot be comprehended by natural thought. After conversing together for some time, the angels departed; and as they went away, each to his own heaven, stars appeared around their heads; and when they were some distance from me, I saw them again in their chariots as before. </p>

386. SECUNDUM MEMORABILE.<p>Quodam mane experrectus e somno vidi duos Angelos descendentes e Coelo, unum e Meridie Coeli, et alterum ex Oriente Coeli, utrumque in Curribus, quibus alligati sunt Equi albi; Currus in quo vectus est Angelus e Meridie Coeli, splendebat sicut ex argento, et Currus, in quo vectus est Angelus ex Oriente Coeli, splendebat sicut ex auro, et habenae, quas tenebant manibus, fulgebant sicut ex luce flammea aurorae: ita mihi visi sunt duo illi Angeli e longinquo, sed cum prope venerunt, non apparebant in Curru, sed in sua Forma angelica, quae est humana; ille, qui ab Oriente Coeli venit, in Veste <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
splendente purpurea erat, et ille qui a Meridie Coeli, in veste hyacinthina. Hi cum sub Coelis in inferioribus erant, accurrebat unus ad alterum, sicut aemularentur quis prior, et se mutuo amplexi et osculati sunt; audivi quod duo illi Angeli, dum in Mundo vixerunt, fuerint amicitia interiore conjuncti, sed nunc unus in Coelo Orientali, alter in Coelo Meridionali; in Coelo orientali sunt qui a Domino in amore sunt, in Coelo autem Meridionali, qui a Domino in sapientia sunt. Illi, postquam aliquamdiu colloquuti sunt de magnificis in Coelis suis, venit in sermonem illorum hoc, Numeri Coelum in essentia sua sit Amor, vel num Sapientia; conveniebant illico, <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
quod unum sit alterius, sed cujus ab origine, ventilabant.</p>
<p>
[2] Ille Angelus, qui e Coelo sapientiae erat, quaesivit alterum, quid Amor; et respondit, quod Amor oriundus a Domino ut Sole, sit Calor vitae angelorum et hominum, ita esse vitae illorum; et quod derivationes amoris dicantur affectiones, et quod per has producantur perceptiones et sic cogitationes; ex quo fluit, quod Sapientia ex origine sua sit Amor, consequenter quod Cogitatio ex origine sua sit Affectio illius amoris, et quod videri possit ex derivationibus in suo ordine lustratis, quod Cogitatio non aliud sit quam Forma affectionis, et quod hoc nesciatur, quia Cogitationes in luce sunt, sed Affectiones in Calore, et quod ideo super Cogitationes reflectatur, non autem super Affectiones. Quod Cogitatio non aliud sit quam forma affectionis alicujus amoris, etiam illustrari potest per loquelam, quod haec non aliud sit, quam forma soni; simile etiam est, quia Sonus correspondet affectioni, et loquela cogitationi, quare affectio sonat, et cogitatio loquitur; hoc etiam potest perspicuum fieri, cum dicitur, aufer sonum a loquela, Numeri detur aliquid loquelae, similiter aufer affectionem a cogitatione, Numeri detur aliquid cogitationis: inde nunc patet, quod Amor sit omne Sapientiae, consequenter quod Essentia Coelorum sit Amor, et quod Existentia illorum sit Sapientia, seu idem, quod Coeli sint ex Divino Amore, et quod existant ex Divino Amore per Divinam Sapientiam, quare, ut prius dictum est, unum est alterius.</p>
<p>
[3] Tunc apud me erat novitius Spiritus, qui audiens haec interrogabat, num simile est cum Charitate et Fide, quia Charitas est affectionis, et Fides est cogitationis; et respondit Angelus, est prorsus simile; Fides non aliud est quam forma charitatis, plane sicut Loquela <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
est forma soni; <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
formatur etiam fides a charitate, sicut formatur loquela a sono; formationis modum etiam novimus in Coelo, sed non vacat illam hic exponere. Adjecit, per Fidem intelligo Fidem spiritualem, in qua vita et spiritus unice est a Domino per Charitatem, nam haec spiritualis est, et per illam fides; quare Fides absque Charitate, est Fides mere naturalis, et haec Fides est mortua; conjungit etiam se cum affectione mere naturali, quae non aliud est, quam concupiscentia.</p>
<p>
[4] Angeli de his loquebantur spiritualiter, ac spiritualis loquela complectitur millia, quae loquela naturalis non potest exprimere, et quod mirum, quae ne quidem possunt in ideas cogitationis naturalis cadere. Postquam Angeli haec et illa loquuti sunt, abiverunt, et cum recesserunt quisque ad suum Coelum, apparebant stellae circum capita illorum, <sup "fn120_5">5</sup>
et cum ad distantiam a me elongati sunt, visi sunt iterum in Curribus, ut prius.<p>
