<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第108节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>108</b>.为进一步证实这一点，我把我所知道的讲述出来，因为我曾看见并因此能见证，如今，主正建立一个新的天使天堂，它由那些信主神救主，并直接靠近祂的人组成；其他所有人都被拒绝。所以，从此以后，来自基督教界的人进入灵界（这是每个人死后的情形）后不信主，单单靠近祂，并且若那时他因生活邪恶，或执着于假道而不能接受这信，那么他一靠近天堂就会遭到排斥，然后背离天堂，朝向低地；因此，他会去往那个地方，与那些启示录中“龙”和“假先知”所指的那些灵人为伍。而且，今后来自基督教国家的人若不信主，便不再蒙垂听；他们的祷告在天堂会变成臭味，就象溃烂的肺所发出的嗳气；即便他自认为他的祷告如同馨香之气，它升往天使天堂时，也不过象从上面来的狂风吹回他眼里的燃烧的烟雾，或藏在修道士长袍里的香炉发出的气味。这就是从今以后向一个分裂的三位一体，而不是向一个合一的三位一体表达虔敬的所有人的命运。本书的主要目的就是说明神性三位一体在主里面合一。对此，我补充以下新的信息：几个月前，主召集十二个使徒去往整个灵界，就象他们在世时去往全世界一样。他们肩负着传讲该福音的使命，每位使徒各自都有分配给他的地区；他们正以极大的热忱和献身精神执行这项使命。有关这些主题的更多内容将本书最后一章，也就是专门论述末世、主的到来和新教会的地方（753－791节）予以说明。<br />附笔</p>

<p>
108. 為了進一步確證這些, 我將報導一個我所知道的真相, 並為此作見證, 這是我親眼目睹。
<p>現在, 一個全新的天國正在被主建立, 由那些相信主上帝拯救者,並徑直歸信祂的人組成; 其它人都被拒絕。從現在起, 若任何從基督徒世界來的人, 當他們進入靈界, 若他們不信主, 不單單歸向祂; 並且因為在世時所過的邪惡生活或接收並確信的偽謬,使他無法轉變信仰, 當他踏上通往天國的第一步時, 就被推回。他會轉臉並徑直朝向地底, 動身前往那個地方,與那裡的靈建立聯繫——就是『啟示錄』中"龍和假先知"所表示的靈。
<p>從現在起, 所有從基督徒領域而來的卻不信主的, 主將不會垂聽他們的禱告。這些人的禱告就像病肺裡嗝出的臭氣, 儘管他們自認為禱告如點燃之乳香。根本達不到天國, 只不過像火裡冒煙, 立即被狂風吹散得無影無蹤。
<p>這就是從現在起,那些盯住分割為三的三位一體,而非聯合為一的三一之信徒的下場。
<p>本書的主要目的就是:聖三一被聯合在主之中。
<p>關於這點, 我再增加一點資訊。就在幾個月前, 十二使徒被主召集,差遣他們到整個心靈世界(如同之前在世時曾被差往物質世界), 他們的任務就是去傳揚這樣的福音。每個使徒分配到各自的領域, 他們正在以全部的熱忱奉獻於此。
<p>關於這些內容, 在本書的最後一章:關於末世,主再來和新教會(第<a href="753.htm">753-791</a>節)會有更詳盡的闡釋。 </p>

108. To further support this point I will relate some things that I know and can testify to because I have seen them.
<p>Today a new angelic heaven is being built by the Lord. It is being made up of those who believe in the Lord God the Savior and who go directly to him; the rest are rejected. From now on if any from the Christian world come into the spiritual world (as happens to us all after we die) and they do not believe in the Lord, do not turn to him alone, and are unable at that point to change in this regard because they have lived in evil ways or have convinced themselves of falsities, when they take their first step toward heaven they are pushed back. Their face is turned away from heaven toward the lower earth. They go off in that direction and join up with spirits in the lower earth who are meant by the dragon and the false prophet in the Book of Revelation.
<p>From now on all people from Christian areas who do not believe in the Lord are not going to be listened to, either. In heaven their prayers are like foul smells and like belches from damaged lungs. If people like that think their own prayer is like burning frankincense, nevertheless it does not reach the angelic heaven any more effectively than would the smoke from a fire that was blown back into their eyes by a storm coming down. Or their praying is like burning incense in a censer under a monks robe.
<p>This is what is going to happen from this time on with all piety that is directed to a separated Trinity rather than a united one.
<p>The main point of this book is that the divine Trinity is united in the Lord.
<p>Here I will add something previously unknown. Several months ago the Lord called together the twelve apostles and sent them out into the whole spiritual world just as they had been sent out before to the physical world. Their assignment was to preach this gospel. Each apostle was assigned a territory to cover. They are carrying out their assignment with complete enthusiasm and energy.
<p>These topics will be specifically covered in the last chapter of this book on the close of the age, the Coming of the Lord, and the New Church [<a href="753.htm">753-791</a>]. </p>

108. As a further confirmation of this I shall report a fact known to me, because I have seen and can bear witness to it. This is that at the present time a new heaven of angels is being established by the Lord, drawn from those who believe in the Lord God the Saviour, and approach Him directly; all others are rejected. So if in future anyone from the Christian part of the world comes into the spiritual world, as everyone does after death, and does not believe in the Lord and approach Him only, and if he is then unable to accept this teaching owing to the wicked life he has led or the false beliefs he has adopted, he is rebuffed on taking the first step towards heaven. His face is turned away and directed towards the Lower Earth; so he departs to that place and associates with its inhabitants, who are those meant in Revelation by 'the Dragon and the False Prophet.' Every person henceforth from Christian countries, who does not believe in the Lord, goes unheard. His prayers are in heaven like foul smells or belches from a diseased lung. Even though he thinks that his praying is like the odour of incense, still it reaches the heaven of the angels only like the smoke of a fire, which is blown back in his eyes by a squall coming from above, or like the odour from a censer under a monk's robe. This is the fate from now on of all expressions of piety which are directed to a divided Trinity, not a united one. It is the leading theme of this book that the Divine Trinity is united in the Lord.<p>At this point I will add a piece of news. A few months ago the twelve apostles were called together by the Lord and sent out into the whole spiritual world, as they were once into the natural world, with instructions to preach this gospel. Each apostle had his own zone assigned to him. They are now following out their instructions with all eagerness and dedication. But a more detailed account of these events will be given in the last chapter of this book, which will deal with the ending of the age, the Lord's coming and the new church. </p>

108. To confirm this further I will relate what I know, because I have seen it and can therefore testify to it, namely, that the Lord is at this day forming a new angelic heaven, and that it is formed of those who believe in the Lord God the Savior, and who approach Him directly, and that all others are rejected. So hereafter, when anyone from Christendom goes into the spiritual world (as every man does at death) and does not believe in the Lord and approach Him alone, and is then unable to receive this faith, because he has lived wickedly or has confirmed himself in falsities, at his first approach toward heaven he is repelled, and turns his face away from heaven and towards the lower earth, whither he goes, and joins those who are there, who are meant, in Revelation, by "the dragon" and the "false prophet." Moreover, no man henceforth in Christian lands is listened to unless he believes in the Lord; his prayers become in heaven like ill-scented odors, and like eructations from ulcerated lungs; and even if his appeal is thought to be like the fumes of incense, it ascends towards the angelic heaven only like the smoke of a conflagration which is blown back into his eyes by a downward gust of wind, or it is like the incense from a censer hidden under a monk's cloak. Such is the case hereafter with all piety that is directed to a divided trinity, not to a united trinity. To show that the Divine trinity is united in the Lord is the chief object of this work. To this I will add the following new information. Some months ago the twelve apostles were called together by the Lord, and were sent forth through the whole spiritual world, as they formerly were through the whole natural world, with the command to preach this gospel; and to each apostle was assigned a particular province; and this command they are executing with great zeal and industry. But on these subjects more will be said in the last chapter of this book, where the Consummation of the Age, the Lord's Coming and the New Church, are specially treated of. </p>

<p>
108. In further confirmation of what has been said I will relate the following circumstances, the truth of which I can testify as they came within my own observation. A new angelic heaven is at this day being formed by the Lord of those who believe on the Lord God the Savior, and who approach Him directly, while all others are rejected. Therefore if any one hereafter, coming from a Christian country into the spiritual world, where every man comes after death, does not believe on the Lord and approach Him alone, and cannot receive this doctrine because he has lived an evil life, or has confirmed his belief in falsities, he is driven back at his first approach towards heaven. He then turns away from heaven towards the Lower Earth, to which he makes his way, and there joins those who are meant in the Revelation by the dragon and the false prophet. Moreover, no man in a Christian country who does not believe on the Lord, is now hearkened to: his prayers rise to heaven as foul odors or as breath from diseased lungs. Although he may fancy his prayer is like the cleansing vapor of incense, yet it appears in the angelic heaven like the smoke from a fire which is blown down into his eyes by a driving storm blast, or like the smoke from a censer held under a monk's cloak. This is the case hereafter with all worship which is directed to a divided, not to a united Trinity. The principal object of this work is to show that the Divine Trinity is united in the Lord.<p>I will here make known this fact hitherto unknown, that some months ago the Lord called together the twelve Apostles, and sent them forth throughout the whole spiritual world, just as He had formerly sent them into all the natural world, with the command to preach this gospel. Each Apostle has his own province assigned to him, and they are now executing this command with all zeal and industry. More will be said concerning this subject in the last chapter of this book, which deals particularly with the Consummation of the Age, the Coming of the Lord, and the New Church. </p>

108. Ad hoc ulterius confirmandum referam quae scio, quia vidi et ideo testari possum, quae sunt; quod hodie a Domino Novum Coelum Angelicum condatur, et quod condatur ex illis, qui in Dominum Deum Salvatorem credunt, et Ipsum immediate adeunt, et quod reliqui rejiciantur; quare si posthac aliquis e Christiano Orbe in Mundum Spiritualem venit, quod fit omni homini post mortem, et non in Dominum credit, et Illum solum adit, et hoc tunc non potest recipere, quia male vixit, aut in falsis se confirmavit, in primo vestigio ad Coelum repellitur, et facies ejus inde avertitur, et convertitur ad Terram Inferiorem, quo etiam abit, et se conjungit cum illis ibi, qui in Apocalypsi per Draconem et Pseudoprophetam intelliguntur. Omnis etiam homo in Terris Christianis, qui non credit in Dominum, posthac nec exauditur; ejus preces in Coelo sunt sicut odores maleolenti, ac sicut eructationes <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
ex pulmone saucio; et si putatur quod oratio ejus sit sicut suffitus ex thure, usque non ascendit ad Coelum angelicum aliter quam sicut fumus incendii, qui a procella deorsum cadente rejicitur in oculos ejus, aut sicut suffitus ex thuribulo sub pallio monachi, ita fit post hoc tempus cum omni pietate, quae determinatur ad Trinitatem discretam, et non ad conjunctam; quod in Domino Divina Trinitas conjuncta sit, est hujus Operis principale objectum. Hic Novum hoc adjiciam, quod ante aliquot Menses duodecim Apostoli a Domino convocati sint, et in Universum Mundum Spiritualem, sicut prius in Mundum naturalem, emissi, cum mandato ut hoc Evangelium praedicent, et tunc cuivis Apostolo sua Regio addicata est; quod mandatum etiam omni zelo et opera obeunt. Sed de his in Ultimo Capite hujus Libri, ubi de CONSUMMATIONE SAECULI, de ADVENTU DOMINI, et de NOVA ECCLESIA, in specie transigetur.<p>
