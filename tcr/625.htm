<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>625</b>.记事五：<br />有一次，当我沉思主的再来时，突然出现一道闪电，猛然击中我的眼睛；因此我抬头观看，看哪，我头上的整个天堂充满明亮的光，我听见从东方到西方连续不断地颂赞神的声音。旁边的天人说：“那是由于主的来临而对祂的颂赞。它出自东西方的天堂。”从南或北方的天堂只能听见轻柔的低语。因为天人能听到所有这些，所以他先对我说，对主的这些颂扬和赞美取自圣言。马上他又说：“现在他们特别用先知但以理所说的这些话颂扬和赞美主”：<br />你既见铁与泥搀杂，却不能彼此相合，正如铁与泥不能相合一样。但在那些日子里，天上的神必另立一国，永不败坏，却要打碎灭绝那一切国，这国必存到永远。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.43.htm">2:43</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.44.htm">44</a>）<br />此后，我听见似唱歌的声音，我朝更远的东方望去，又看见一道光芒，比之前那道还要明亮。我问天人，那里的颂赞是什么。他说，是但以理书中的这些话：<br />我在夜间的异象中观看，见有一位像人子的，驾着天云而来，得了权柄、国度，使各国、各族的人都事奉他。他的权柄是永远的，不能废去，他的国必不败坏。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.13.htm">但以理书7:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.14.htm">14</a>）<br />除此之外，他们用启示录中的这些话颂赞主：<br />愿荣耀、权能归给耶稣基督；看哪，祂驾云降临。祂是阿拉法，祂是俄梅戛，祂是初，是终，是首先的，是末后的，昔在、今在、以后永在的全能者；我约翰从七个灯台中间出来的人子那里听到这一切。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.5.htm">启示录1:5</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.8.htm">22:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.30.htm">以及马太福音24:30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.32.htm">32</a>）<br />我又向东方天堂望去，光从右侧发出，光照一直扩散到南方苍穹，我听见甜美的声音，就问天人，他们对主的颂赞是什么，他说它就是启示录中的这些话：<br />我看见一个新天新地。又看见圣城新耶路撒冷由神那里从天而降，预备好了，就如新妇妆饰整齐，等候丈夫。我听见有大声音从天堂出来说：“看哪！神的帐幕在人间。他要与人同住。有一位天人对我说：“你到这里来，我要将新妇，就是羔羊的妻，指给你看。”我被圣灵感动，天使就带我到一座高大的山，将那由神那里从天而降的圣城耶路撒冷指示我。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.1.htm">启示录21:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.10.htm">10</a>）<br />我耶稣是明亮的晨星；圣灵和新妇都说：“来！”祂说：“我必快来！”阿们！主耶稣啊，我愿你来！（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.16.htm">启示录22:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.20.htm">20</a>）<br />此后，我又听见更多的声音，我听见从东方天堂到西方天堂，以及从南方到北方，全是一片颂赞声。我问天人：“现在这颂赞是什么？”他说：“是先知的话”：<br />凡有血气的，必都知道我耶和华是你的救主，是你的救赎主。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.26.htm">以赛亚书49:26</a>）<br />耶和华以色列的君，以色列的救赎主，万军之耶和华如此说：我是首先的，我是末后的，除我以外再没有真神！（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.6.htm">以赛亚书44:6</a>）<br />到那日，人必说：“看哪，这是我们的神，我们素来等候他，他必拯救我们。这是耶和华，我们素来等候他。”（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛25.9.htm">以赛亚书25:9</a>）<br />在旷野，有人声喊着说：“当预备耶和华的路”。看哪，主耶和华必像大能者临到，他必像牧人牧养自己的羊群。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.3.htm">以赛亚书40:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.11.htm">11</a>）<br />因有一婴孩为我们而生，有一子赐给我们；他名称为“奇妙策士”、“全能的神”、“永在的父”、“和平的君”！（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.6.htm">以赛亚书9:6</a>）<br />看哪，日子将到，我要给大卫兴起一个公义的苗裔；他必掌王权，这是祂的名，耶和华我们的义。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.5.htm">耶利米书23:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.6.htm">6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.15.htm">33:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.16.htm">16</a>）<br />万军之耶和华是他的名；救赎你的是以色列的圣者，他必称为全地之神。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.5.htm">以赛亚书54:5</a>）<br />那日耶和华必作全地的王，耶和华必为独一无二的，他的名也是独一无二的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.9.htm">撒迦利亚书14:9</a>）<br />听到并理解这一切后，我的心欢呼雀跃，我就高高兴兴地回家了，然后从属灵的状态回到肉体的状态，将我耳闻目睹的这些事记录下来。</p>

625. The fifth memorable occurrence. On one occasion when I was meditating on the Lord's Second Coming, an intensely bright light suddenly appeared and shone right in my eyes. I looked up and was amazed to see that the whole heaven above me was full of light. I heard praises upon praises in a long chain from the east to the west.
<p>An angel appeared by me and said, "These praises are glorifying the Lord on account of his Coming. The praises are coming from angels of the eastern and western heavens. "
<p>All that was heard from the southern and northern heavens was a gentle murmur.
<p>Because the angel was hearing it all, he first said to me, "The praises they are using to celebrate the Lord come from the Word. "
<p>Soon afterward he said, "Now they are specifically glorifying and celebrating the Lord with the following words in the prophet Daniel:
<p>You saw iron mixed with muddy clay, but they will not stick together. But in those days God will make a kingdom rise in the heavens, which will not pass away throughout the ages. It will grind down and consume all the [other] kingdoms, but it will stand throughout the ages. (<a href="3927/daniel_2_43.htm">Daniel 2:43-44</a>)
</p>
<p>
[2] After that I heard something like a voice singing, and farther to the east I saw a brilliant light that was even brighter than the one I had seen before. I asked the angel what the praises were there. He said they were praising the Lord with the following words in Daniel:
<p>I saw visions in the night, and behold, the Son of Humankind was coming with the clouds of heaven. He was given dominion and a kingdom. All peoples and nations will worship him. His dominion is a dominion of an age that will not pass, and his kingdom is one that will not perish. (<a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>)
<p>"They are also celebrating the Lord with the following words from the Book of Revelation.
<p>Jesus Christ has glory and strength. Behold, he is coming with the clouds. He is the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last, the One who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty. I, John, heard this from the Son of Humankind among the seven lampstands. (<a href="3927/revelation_1_5.htm">Revelation 1:5-7</a>, ; <a href="3927/revelation_22_8.htm">22:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_22_13.htm">13</a>; also <a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30-31</a>)
</p>
<p>
[3] I looked again at the eastern heaven, and it lit up to the right, and its brightness extended into the southern expanse. I heard a sweet sound. I asked the angel, "What are their praises for the Lord?"
<p>The angel said, "They are using the following words in the Book of Revelation.
<p>I saw a new heaven and a new earth, and I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared like a bride for her husband. I heard a loud voice from heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is among people, and he will dwell with them. " And the angel spoke with me saying, "Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb. " And [the angel] carried me away in the spirit to the top of a mountain great and high, and showed me the city, holy Jerusalem. (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-3</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">9-10</a>)
<p>"They are also using these words.
<p>"I, Jesus, am the bright and morning star. " And the spirit and the bride say, "Come!" And he said, "I am coming quickly. " Truly indeed, come, Lord Jesus. (<a href="3927/revelation_22_16.htm">Revelation 22:16-17</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_22_20.htm">20</a>)
</p>
<p>
[4] After these and many other praises, there was an overall praise that went from the east to the west of heaven and also from the south to the north.
<p>I asked the angel, "What now?"
<p>"These praises," the angel replied, "are using the following passages from the prophets.
<p>So that all flesh may know that I, Jehovah, am your Savior and your Redeemer. (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>)
<p>Thus said Jehovah, the King of Israel and its Redeemer, Jehovah Sabaoth: "I am the First and the Last, and there is no God except me. " (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>)
<p>It will be said in that day, "Behold, this is our God. We have waited for him to free us. This is Jehovah whom we have waited for. " (<a href="3927/isaiah_25_9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>)
<p>The voice of one crying in the desert, "Prepare a way for Jehovah. Behold, the Lord Jehovih is coming with strength; like a shepherd he will feed his flock. " (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">10-11</a>)
<p>A Child is born to us; a Son is given to us. His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. (<a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>)
<p>Behold, the days are coming when I will raise up for David a righteous offshoot who will reign as king; and this is his name: Jehovah is our Justice. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>)
<p>Jehovah Sabaoth is his name, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. He will be called God of all the earth. (<a href="3927/isaiah_54_5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>)
<p>In that day, Jehovah will be king over the whole earth; in that day there will be one Jehovah, and his name will be one. (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>)
<p>Because I heard and understood these things, my heart rejoiced. Filled with joy, I went home, and there returned from the state of my spirit into the state of my body and wrote down the things that I had heard and seen. </p>

625. <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
The fifth experience.<p>Once when I was meditating on the Lord's second coming, there suddenly appeared a beam of light, so powerful as to dazzle my eyes. So I looked up, and saw the whole heaven above me full of light; and from east to west I heard a long series of voices glorifying God. An angel came close and said: 'This is the glorifying of the Lord on account of His coming, uttered by the angels of the eastern and western heavens.' Nothing was heard from the southern or northern heavens but a polite murmur.<p>Since the angel could hear everything, he told me first that this glorifying and praising of the Lord was taken from the Word. Then he said: 'Now in particular they are glorifying and praising the Lord with the words spoken by the prophet Daniel.<p>You have seen iron mixed with common clay, but they will not hold together. But in those days the God of the heavens will cause a kingdom to rise which shall not perish for ever. It will shatter and consume all these kingdoms, but will stand itself for ever.' <a href="3927/daniel_2_43.htm">Daniel 2:43-44</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] After this I heard what sounded like singing, and yet further away to the east I saw a gleam of light more brilliant than before. I asked the angel what was the glorifying taking place there. He said it was what Daniel described:<p>I was watching in the visions of the night and I saw the Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven. To him were given dominion and the kingdom and all peoples and nations will worship him. His dominion will be a dominion for ever, which will not pass away, and his kingdom one that will not perish, <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>.<p>Besides this they praise the Lord with these words from Revelation:<p>To Jesus Christ be glory and strength. Behold, He comes with clouds. He is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty. I, John, heard this from the Son of Man from the midst of the seven lampstands, <a href="3927/revelation_1_5.htm">Revelation 1:5-13</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_8.htm">22:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_22_13.htm">13</a>, Also with the words of <a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30-31</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] I looked again to the east of heaven, and the light was growing from the right; the brightness spread into the expanse of sky to the south, and I heard a sweet sound. I asked the angel what glorifying of the Lord was taking place there. He said it was with these words from Revelation:<p>I saw a new heaven and a new earth; and I saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared like a bride for her husband. And I heard a mighty voice out of heaven saying: Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them. And the angel spoke with me and said: Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb. And he carried me away in the spirit onto a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-3</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">9-10</a>.<p>Also with these words:<p>I, Jesus, am the bright star of the morning; and the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And He said, I am coming soon. Amen; even so, come, Lord Jesus, <a href="3927/revelation_22_16.htm">Revelation 22:16-17</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_22_20.htm">20</a>.</p>
<p>
[4] After this and more I heard a general glorifying from the east of heaven to the west, and also from the south to the north. I asked the angel what this was. He said it was these words from the Prophets:<p>Let all flesh know that I am Jehovah your Saviour and your Redeemer, <a href="3927/isaiah_49_26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>.<p>Thus spoke Jehovah, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, Jehovah Zebaoth, I am the first and the last, and there is no God beside me, <a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>.<p>On that day it will be said, Behold, this is our God, whom we have awaited to free us. He is Jehovah, whom we have awaited, <a href="3927/isaiah_25_9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>.<p>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way for Jehovah. Behold, the Lord Jehovih comes in strength. He will feed his flock like a shepherd, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">10-11</a>.<p>A child is born for us, a son is given to us, whose name is Wonderful, Counsellor, God, Hero, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of peace, <a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>.<p>Behold, the days will come when I shall raise up for David a righteous shoot, who will reign as king.

625. Fifth Memorable Relation: <p>Once when I was meditating about the Lord's second coming, there suddenly appeared a flash of light which forcibly struck my eyes; and I therefore looked up, and lo, the whole heaven above me appeared luminous, and there from the east to the west in a continuous strain a Glorification was heard; and an angel stood near who said, "That is a glorification of the Lord on account of His coming. It comes from the angels of the eastern and western heavens." <p>From the southern and northern heavens only a gentle murmur was heard. <p>And because all this was heard by the angel, he first said to me that these glorifications and celebrations of the Lord are made from the Word. Presently he said, "Now they are glorifying and celebrating the Lord especially by these words, which are spoken in the prophecy of Daniel: <p>Thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, but they shall not cohere. But in those days the God of the heavens shall make a kingdom to arise which shall not perish for ages it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, but itself shall stand for ages (<a href="3927/daniel_2_43.htm">2:43, 44</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] After this I heard the sound of singing, and more deeply in the east I saw a flashing of light more brilliant than the former; and I asked the angel what the glorification there was. <p>He said it was in these words in Daniel: <p>I saw in the night visions, and behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and there was given Him dominion, and a kingdom; and all people and nations shall worship Him; His dominion is the dominion of an age, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed (<a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>). <p>Beside this they were celebrating the Lord from these words in the Apocalypse: <p>To Jesus Christ be the glory and the might; behold, He cometh with clouds. He is the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the Fist and the last, Who is, Who was, and Who is to come, the Almighty; I John heard this from the Son of man out of the midst of the seven candlesticks (<a href="3927/revelation_1_5.htm">Revelation 1:5-13</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_8.htm">22:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_22_13.htm">13</a>; also <a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_32.htm">32</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] I looked again into the eastern heaven, and it lighted up from the right side, the illumination extended to the southern expanse, and I heard a sweet sound, and asked the angel what it was pertaining to the Lord that they were glorifying there; and he said that it was in these words in the Apocalypse: <p>I saw a new heaven and a new earth, and I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of the heaven saying, Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them. And an angel spoke with me, saying, Come, and I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb. And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the city, the holy Jerusalem (Rev.<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21:1</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_3.htm">3</a>, 9 ,<a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">10</a>). <p>I Jesus am the bright and morning star; and the Spirit and the bride say, Come, and He said I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come Lord Jesus (<a href="3927/revelation_22_16.htm">Revelation 22:16, 17</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_22_20.htm">20</a>).
</p>
<p>
[4] After this and more, a general glorification from the east to the west of heaven, and also from south to north was heard; and I asked the angel, "What now?" He said, "The following from the prophets": <p>All flesh shall know that I Jehovah am thy Savior and thy Redeemer (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>). <p>Thus said Jehovah the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Jehovah of Hosts, I am the First and the Last, and beside Me there is no God (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>). <p>It shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him that He may deliver us; this is Jehovah; we have waited for Him, (<a href="3927/isaiah_25_9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>). <p>The voice of one crying in the desert, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah. Behold, the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength; He shall feed His flock like a shepherd (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">Isaiah 40:3,</a><a href="3927/isaiah_40_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">10, 11</a>). <p>Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and His name shall be Wonderful, Counselor, God, Mighty, Father of eternity, Prince of peace (<a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). <p>Behold the days will come when I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and He shall reign King and this is His name, Jehovah our righteousness (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5, 6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15, 16</a>). <p>Jehovah of Hosts is His name, and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel, the God of the whole earth shall He be called (<a href="3927/isaiah_54_5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>). <p>In that day Jehovah shall be king over all the earth; in that day Jehovah shall be one and His name one (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>). <p>Hearing and understanding these things my heart greatly rejoiced, and I went home joyfully, and here I returned from the spiritual to the bodily state, in which I wrote out all this that I had seen and heard. </p>

625. The fifth experience. Once while I was meditating on the Lord's Second Coming, there suddenly appeared a brilliant light dazzling my eyes. I there upon looked up, and lo! the whole heaven above me appeared flooded with light, and from the east to the west I heard a long continued glorification. An angel who stood near me said: "That is a glorification of the Lord on account of His Coming, by the angels of the eastern and western heavens." From the southern and northern heavens there was heard a gentle murmur. As the angel heard everything, he first told me that those glorifications and celebrations of the Lord were taken from the Word. Presently he said: "Now they are glorifying and celebrating the Lord" particularly by these words in the prophet Daniel:<p>'Thou sawest iron mixed with clay... but they shall not cleave one to another... and in those days (A.V., in the days of these kings) shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed... It shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever." <a href="3927/daniel_2_43.htm">Daniel 2:43-44</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] After this I heard, as it were, the sound of voices singing, and farther in the east I saw a glow of light far brighter than the former. I asked the angel, "By what words do they glorify God in that quarter?" He replied: "By these words in Daniel:<p>'I saw in the night visions, and, behold, the Son of Man (A.V., one like the Son of Man) came with the clouds of heaven... And there was given Him dominion... and a kingdom, that all people and nations... should serve Him: His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.' <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">7:13-14</a>.<p>They are further celebrating the Lord from these words in the Revelation:<p>To Jesus Christ 'be glory and dominion... Behold, He cometh with clouds.'... He is Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, the First and the Last, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. I, John, heard this from the Son of Man, out of the midst of the seven candlesticks. <a href="3927/revelation_1_5.htm">1:5-7</a>, [<a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">8-9</a>], <a href="3927/revelation_1_10.htm">10-13</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_1.htm">22</a> [<a href="3927/revelation_22_8.htm">8</a>], <a href="3927/revelation_22_13.htm">13</a>;<p>and also from <a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30-31</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] I looked again towards the eastern heaven, and a light shone on the right hand, and its brilliance extended to the southern expanse. Then I heard a sweet sound, and I asked the angel, "By what words do they glorify the Lord there?" He answered: "By these words in the Revelation:<p>'I saw a new heaven and a new earth... And I... saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride... for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall dwell with them... and (the angel) talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the Bride, the Lamb's Wife. And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem.' <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-2</a>, [<a href="3927/revelation_21_3.htm">3</a>], <a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">9-10</a>;<p>and also by these words:<p>'I Jesus... am the bright and morning star. And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come... He saith... I come quickly: Amen. Even so, come Lord Jesus.' <a href="3927/revelation_22_16.htm">Revelation 22:16-17</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_22_20.htm">20</a>.<p>After he had said this and much more, there was heard a general glorification from the east to the west of heaven, and also from the south to the north; and I asked the angel, "By what words do they now glorify the Lord?" He answered: "Their words are taken from the prophets:<p>'All flesh shall know that I, JEHOVAH, am thy Savior and thy Redeemer' <a href="3927/isaiah_49_26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>.<p>'Thus saith JEHOVAH the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, JEHOVAH ZEBAOTH; I am the First, and... the Last; and besides me there is no God.' <a href="3927/isaiah_44_8.htm">Isaiah 44:8</a>.<p>'It shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us: this is JEHOVAH; we have waited for Him.' <a href="3927/isaiah_25_9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>.<p>'The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of JEHOVAH... Behold, the Lord Jehovih will come with strong hand... He shall feed His flock like a shepherd.' <a href="3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">10-11</a>.<p>'Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given... His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.' <a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>.<p>'Behold, the days come... that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign... and this is His name... JEHOVAH our righteousness.' <a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>.<p>'JEHOVAH ZEBAOTH is His name; and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; the God of the whole earth shall He be called.' <a href="3927/isaiah_54_5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>.<p>In that day 'JEHOVAH shall be King over all the earth; in that day shall there be one JEHOVAH, and His name one.' <a href="3927/zechariah_14_9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>.<p>As I heard and understood these things my heart rejoiced, and I went home well pleased. There I returned from being in the spirit to the body, when I wrote down what I had seen and heard. </p>

625. QUINTUM MEMORABILE.<p>Quondam cum de Secundo Adventu Domini meditabar, subito apparuit jubar lucis fortiter stringens oculos meos, quare suspexi, et ecce totum Coelum super me apparuit luminosum, et ab Oriente in Occidentem ibi in longa serie audita est GLORIFICATIO, et adstitit Angelus, et dixit, Glorificatio illa est Glorificatio Domini propter Adventum Ipsius, quae fit ab Angelis Coeli Orientalis et Occidentalis: e Coelo Meridionali et Septentrionali non audiebatur nisi facetum murmur; et quia Angelus audivit omnia, dixit mihi primum, quod Glorificationes et Celebrationes illae Domini fiant ex Verbo; et mox dixit, nunc in specie glorificant et celebrant Dominum per haec, quae apud Danielem Prophetam dicta sunt, Vidisti ferrum mixtum cum argilla luti, sed non cohaerebunt: verum in diebus illis surgere faciet Deus Coelorum Regnum, quod in saecula non peribit; conteret et consumet omnia illa Regna, ipsum autem stabit in saecula, <a href="3927/daniel_2_43.htm">Daniel 2:43-44</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] Post haec audivi sicut vocem cantus, et penitius in Oriente vidi coruscum lucis priori splendentius; et quaesivi Angelum, quid ibi glorificant, dixit quod per haec apud Danielem, Videns fui in visionibus noctis, et ecce cum Nubibus Coeli FILIUS HOMINIS veniens fuit; et Huic datum est Dominium et Regnum, et omnes populi et gentes Ipsum colent; Dominium Ipsius Dominium saeculi, quod non transibit; et Regnum Ipsius quod non peribit, <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>.

[3] Spectavi iterum in Coelum Orientale, et illuxit a latere dextro, et Luminosum intravit in Expansum Meridionale, et audivi sonum suavem; et quaesivi Angelum, quid Domini ibi glorificant; dixit quod per haec in Apocalypsi, Vidi Coelum Novum et Terram Novam, et vidi Urbem Sanctam Hierosolymam Novam descendentem a Deo e Coelo, paratam sicut SPONSAM MARITO SUO; et audivi vocem magnam e Coelo, dicentem, ecce Tabernaculum Dei cum HOMINIBUS, qui habitabit cum illis.
