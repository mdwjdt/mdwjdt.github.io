<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>82</b>. （1）为了赎回并拯救人类，耶和华神降下来并给自己取了人的样式。当今基督教会都相信：神，宇宙的创造者自永恒就育有一个儿子，祂降下来并给自己取了人的样式，以赎回并拯救人类。只要心思专注于神是一，那么这种错误观点就会自行土崩瓦解。在理智看来，以下说法比难以置信更糟糕：这一位神自永恒就生了一个儿子，并且父神，连同每一个单独为神的圣子和圣灵是一位神。当圣言表明，耶和华神亲自降下来并变成人，以及救世主时，这种难以置信的观点就会像坠落到大气层的陨石那样彻底爆炸。<br />第一点，即耶和华神亲自降下来并变成人，可通过以下经文得以证实：<br />看哪，必有童女怀孕生子，祂必称为与我们同在的神。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.14.htm">以赛亚书7:14</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太1.23.htm">马太福音1:23</a>）<br />有一婴孩为我们而生，有一子赐给我们，政权必担在祂的肩头上。祂名称为奇妙、策士、神、勇士、永恒的父、和平的君！（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.6.htm">以赛亚书9:6</a>）<br />到那日，人必说，看哪，祂是我们的神，我们素来等候祂来救我们。祂是耶和华，我们素来等候祂，我们必因祂的救恩欢喜快乐。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛25.9.htm">以赛亚书25:9</a>）<br />有人声喊着说，在旷野预备耶和华的路，在沙漠地修平我们神的道。凡有血气的必一同看见。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.3.htm">以赛亚书40:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.5.htm">5</a>）<br />看哪，主耶和华必以大能临到，祂的膀臂将为祂掌权。看哪，祂的赏赐在祂那里；祂象牧人牧养自己的羊群。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.10.htm">以赛亚书40:10</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.11.htm">11</a>）<br />耶和华说，锡安的女儿啊，应当欢喜快乐。看哪，我要来住在你们中间。然后，到那日，必有许多民族归附耶和华。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.10.htm">撒迦利亚书2:10</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.11.htm">11</a>）<br />我耶和华凭公义召你，必使你作众民的约。我是耶和华，这是我的名字；我必不将我的荣耀给另一个。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.6.htm">以赛亚书42:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.8.htm">8</a>）<br />看哪，日子将到，我要给大卫兴起一个公义的苗裔，祂必掌王权，在地上施行公平和公义。这是祂的名，耶和华我们的义。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.5.htm">耶利米书23:5</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.6.htm">6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.15.htm">33:15</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.16.htm">16</a>）<br />还有一些经文，在那里，主的到来被称为“耶和华的日子”（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.6.htm">如以赛亚书13:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.22.htm">22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.15.htm">以西结书31:15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥1.15.htm">约珥书1:15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.1.htm">2:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.29.htm">29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.31.htm">31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.1.htm">3:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.13.htm">阿摩司书5:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.20.htm">20</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.7.htm">西番雅书1:7</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.1.htm">撒迦利亚书14:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.4.htm">4</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.21.htm">21</a>等等）。<br />路加福音公开声称，耶和华亲自降下来并给自己取了人的样式：<br />玛利亚对天使说，这事怎能成就？ 因为我不认识男人。天使回答她说，圣灵要降临到你身上，至高者的能力要荫庇你，因此所要生的圣者必称为神的儿子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.34.htm">路加福音1:34</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.35.htm">35</a>）<br />在马太福音，天使在梦中对与玛利亚订婚的约瑟说：<br />她所怀的孕是从圣灵来的；约瑟不认识她，直到她生了儿子，就给祂起名叫耶稣。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太1.20.htm">马太福音1:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太1.25.htm">25</a>）<br />圣灵表从耶和华神发出的神性，如将在本书三章（138－188节）所看到的。众所周知，后代从父亲得其灵魂和生命，而身体则来自灵魂。那么，还有比“主的灵魂和生命来自耶和华神，因为神性无法分割，父的神性本身就是主的灵魂和生命”说得更清楚的事吗？这就是为何主经常称耶和华神为祂的父，耶和华神则称主为祂的儿子。还有比声称我们主的灵魂来自祂母亲玛利亚更可笑的事吗？然而，这就是天主教徒和新教徒所做的梦，他们还没有被圣言唤醒。</p>

<p>
82. 需要逐一解釋這些觀點。
<p>(1)宇宙的創造者耶和華降世,並取了人的樣式, 是為了救贖及拯救人類。
<p>現今基督徒教會所信的:上帝——宇宙的創造者, 從永遠生了
<p>一個兒子。為了救贖並拯救人類, 這個兒子降世取了人的樣式。然而, 這個信仰是錯的。只要我們的思想集中於上帝的唯一性, 這個錯誤的信仰就立刻土崩瓦解。聽起來有理, 但其實是荒謬的說法:一位上帝從永遠生了一個兒子, 這位父上帝與兒子,還有聖靈, 每一位都各自是上帝, 三位又是一位上帝。當聖言中顯明:(a)是耶和華上帝自己降世成為人; (b)耶和華上帝是救贖者。上面虛構的謊言就如同空中的流星消散無影了。
<p>[2]第一:是耶和華上帝自己降世成為人, 在以下經文可以說明:
<p>看啊, 有童女懷孕並生一子, 祂必稱為以馬內利(上帝與我們同在)(<a href="3927/isaiah_7_14.htm">以賽亞書7:14</a>;<a href="3927/matthew_1_23.htm">馬太福音1:23</a>)。有一男孩為我們而生, 有一子賜給我們, 君權必擔在祂的肩上; 祂名稱為奇妙,策士,全能的上帝,永在的父,和平的君(<a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">以賽亞書9:6</a>)。在那日, 人必說:"看哪, 這是我們的上帝。我們素來等候祂, 祂必拯救我們。這是耶和華, 我們素來等候祂, 我們必因祂的救恩歡喜快樂"(<a href="3927/isaiah_25_9.htm">以賽亞書25:9</a>)。在曠野有人聲喊叫:"為耶和華預備道路, 在沙漠地修平我們上帝的道。凡有血氣的必一同看見"(<a href="3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">以賽亞書40:3</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_5.htm">5</a>)。看哪, 主耶和華必象大能者來到, 祂的膀臂將為祂掌權, 祂的賞賜在祂那裡; 祂象牧人牧養自己的羊群(<a href="3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">以賽亞書40:10-11</a>)。耶和華說:"錫安的女兒啊, 當歡喜快樂。看哪, 我要來, 將住在你們當中。"然後許多百姓在那日子歸向耶和華(<a href="3927/zechariah_2_10.htm">撒迦利亞書2:10-11</a>)。我耶和華憑公義召你, 我將使你作眾民的約。我是耶和華, 這是我的名字; 我不會將自己的榮耀給另一個(<a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">以賽亞書42:6</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_42_8.htm">8</a>)。看啊, 日子將到, 那時我將從大衛興起一個公義的後裔, 祂將如王掌權, 並在地上施行公平公義。這是祂的名字:耶和華我們的義(<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">耶利米書23:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>)。
<p>還有一些章節, 主的降臨被稱為"耶和華的日子", 例如<a href="3927/isaiah_13_6.htm">以賽亞書13:6</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_22.htm">22</a>;<a href="3927/ezekiel_31_15.htm">以西結書31:15</a>;<a href="3927/joel_1_15.htm">約珥書1:15</a>; <a href="3927/joel_2_1.htm">2:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/joel_2_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/joel_2_29.htm">29</a>, <a href="3927/joel_2_31.htm">31</a>; <a href="3927/joel_3_1.htm">3:1</a>, <a href="3927/joel_3_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/joel_3_18.htm">18</a>;<a href="3927/amos_5_13.htm">阿摩司書5:13</a>, <a href="3927/amos_5_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="3927/amos_5_20.htm">20</a>;<a href="3927/zephaniah_1_7.htm">西番雅書1:7-18</a>;<a href="3927/zechariah_14_1.htm">撒迦利亞書14:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_4.htm">4-21</a>; Zechariah 14: 以及其它等等。
<p>[3]耶和華自己就是降臨並取了人身顯現的那位, 可從『路加福音』中更明顯看出, 那裡寫道:"瑪利亞對天人說:'我還沒有出嫁, 怎麼有這事呢？'這天人回答她:'聖靈要靈到你身上, 至高者的能力要蔭庇你, 因此所要生的聖者將被稱為上帝的兒子'"(<a href="3927/luke_1_34.htm">路加福音1:34-35</a>)。在『馬太福音』說道, 在夢中天人告訴已與瑪利亞訂婚的約瑟, 她所懷的孩子是從聖靈而來。並且在這個取名為耶穌的孩子生下之前, 約瑟並未與她同房(<a href="3927/matthew_1_20.htm">馬太福音1:20</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_1_25.htm">25</a>)。在此, "聖靈"的意思指從耶和華上帝發出的能力, 在第三章關於聖靈的內容可以看到(第<a href="138.htm">138-188</a>節)。
<p>任何人當知道, 一個後代的靈魂和生命從其父而來, 身體又是從靈魂而來。於是, 可以明白地說, 主的靈魂和生命是從耶和華上帝而來。又因為神性不可以分割, 因而主的靈魂和生命就是父的神性本身。這是就為何主經常稱耶和華上帝為祂的父親, 耶和華上帝稱主為祂的兒子。有什麼比聲稱我們主的靈魂來自於瑪利亞更荒唐的呢？然而這些仍是當今的天主教徒和新教徒們夢想的大事呢, 他們仍未被聖言的內容喚醒。 </p>

82. 1. Jehovah God came down and took on a human manifestation in order to redeem people and save them. The belief among Christian churches nowadays is that God, the Creator of the universe, procreated a Son from eternity. That Son came down and took on a human manifestation in order to redeem people and save them. This belief is wrong, however. It spontaneously falls apart as long as our thinking focuses on the fact that there is one God. To sound reason it is worse than nonsense to think that the one God procreated some Son from eternity and that God the Father together with the Son and the Holy Spirit, each of whom is individually God, together make one God. This fiction completely vanishes like a shooting star in the air when the Word is quoted to show (a) that Jehovah God himself came down and became human and (b) that Jehovah God also became the Redeemer.
</p>
<p>
[2] As for the first point, the following passages show that Jehovah God himself came down and became human:
<p>Behold, a virgin will conceive and bear a Son, who will be called God with us. (<a href="3927/isaiah_7_14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_1_23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>)
<p>A Child is born to us; a Son is given to us. Authority will rest on his shoulder, and his name will be called Wonderful, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. (<a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>)
<p>It will be said in that day, "Behold, this is our God. We have waited for him to free us. This is Jehovah whom we have waited for. Let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation. " (<a href="3927/isaiah_25_9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>)
<p>The voice of one crying in the desert, "Prepare a way for Jehovah; make a level pathway in the solitude for our God. And all flesh will see it together. " (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_5.htm">5</a>)
<p>Behold, the Lord Jehovih is coming with strength, and his arm will rule for him. Behold, his reward is with him; like a shepherd he will feed his flock. (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">Isaiah 40:10-11</a>)
<p>Jehovah said, "Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Zion. Behold, I am coming to live in your midst. " Then many peoples will cling to Jehovah in that day. (<a href="3927/zechariah_2_10.htm">Zechariah 2:10-11</a>)
<p>I, Jehovah, have called you in justice; I will give you as a covenant to the people. I am Jehovah. This is my name. I will not give my glory to another. (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_42_8.htm">8</a>)
<p>Behold, the days are coming when I will raise up for David a righteous offshoot who will reign as king and execute judgment and justice on the earth. And this is his name: Jehovah our Justice. (; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>)
<p>Then there are the passages where the coming of the Lord is called "the day of Jehovah," such as <a href="3927/isaiah_13_6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_22.htm">22</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_31_15.htm">Ezekiel 31:15</a>; <a href="3927/joel_1_15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="3927/joel_2_1.htm">2:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/joel_2_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/joel_2_29.htm">29</a>, <a href="3927/joel_2_31.htm">31</a>; <a href="3927/joel_3_1.htm">3:1</a>, <a href="3927/joel_3_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/joel_3_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/amos_5_13.htm">Amos 5:13</a>, <a href="3927/amos_5_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="3927/amos_5_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7-18</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_14_1.htm">Zechariah 14:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_4.htm">4-21</a>; and elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
[3] That Jehovah himself was the one who came down and took on a human manifestation is clearly established in Luke, when it says, "Mary said to the angel, 'How will this take place, since I have not had intercourse? The angel replied to her, The Holy Spirit will descend upon you, and the power of the Highest will cover you; therefore the Holy One that is born from you will be called the Son of God'" (<a href="3927/luke_1_34.htm">Luke 1:34-35</a>). In Matthew it says that in a dream an angel told Joseph, who was betrothed to Mary, that the child that had been conceived in her was from the Holy Spirit. And Joseph did not have intercourse with her until she gave birth to a Son and called his name Jesus (<a href="3927/matthew_1_20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_1_25.htm">25</a>). The "Holy Spirit" means the divine power that radiates from Jehovah God, as we will see in the third chapter of this work [138-188].
<p>Everyone knows that an offspring's soul and life come from its father, and the body comes from that soul. To state it very openly, then, the Lord's soul and life came from Jehovah God; and because divinity cannot be divided, the Lord's soul and life was the Father's divinity itself. This is why the Lord frequently called Jehovah God his Father, and Jehovah God called the Lord his Son. What would be more absurd to hear therefore than the idea that the soul of our Lord came from Mary his mother? Yet this is the very thing that both Roman Catholics and Protestants are dreaming today, and they have not been awakened by the Word yet. </p>

82. (i) JEHOVAH GOD CAME DOWN AND TOOK UPON HIMSELF HUMAN FORM, IN ORDER TO REDEEM AND SAVE MANKIND.<p>Christian churches today believe that God the Creator of the universe fathered a Son from eternity, who came down and took upon Himself human form to redeem and save mankind. But this is an error and collapses of its own accord, so long as the mind concentrates on the oneness of God, and the reason looks upon as fiction or worse the idea that the one God fathered a Son from eternity, and also that God the Father together with the Son and the Holy Spirit, each of whom is severally God, is one God. This fiction is utterly exploded, like a meteorite in the atmosphere, when it is shown from the Word that it was Jehovah God Himself who came down and became man and also was the Redeemer.</p>
<p>
[2] The first point, that it was Jehovah God Himself who came down and became man, is established by these passages:<p>Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, who shall be called God with us, <a href="3927/isaiah_7_14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_1_23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>.<p>A boy is born for us, a son is given to us, on whose shoulder the dominion shall be; and his name shall be called Wonderful, God, Hero, the everlasting Father, the Prince of peace, <a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>.<p>On that day it will be said, Behold, He is our God, whom we have awaited to free us. He is Jehovah, whom we have awaited. Let us exult and rejoice in His salvation, <a href="3927/isaiah_25_9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>.<p>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way for Jehovah, make smooth in the desert a path for our God; and all flesh shall see it together, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_5.htm">5</a>.<p>Behold, the Lord Jehovih comes in strength, and His arm shall bear dominion for Him. Behold, His recompense comes with Him; He will tend His flock like a shepherd, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">Isaiah 40:10-11</a>.<p>Jehovah said, Shout for joy and rejoice, daughter of Zion; behold, I come to dwell in your midst; then shall many nations cleave to Jehovah on that day, <a href="3927/zechariah_2_10.htm">Zechariah 2:10-11</a>.<p>I Jehovah have called you in righteousness, and I will give you to be a covenant with the people. I am Jehovah, this is my name; my glory I shall not give to another, <a href="3927/isaiah_42_1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">6-8</a>.<p>Behold, the days will come when I will raise up for David a righteous shoot, who will reign as king and do judgment and righteousness upon earth; and this is His name, Jehovah our righteousness, <a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>.<p>There are also the passages where the Lord's coming is called 'the day of Jehovah', as <a href="3927/isaiah_13_6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_22.htm">22</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_31_15.htm">Ezekiel 31:15</a>; <a href="3927/joel_1_15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="3927/joel_2_1.htm">2:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/joel_2_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/joel_2_29.htm">29</a>, <a href="3927/joel_2_31.htm">31</a>; <a href="3927/joel_3_1.htm">3:1</a>, <a href="3927/joel_3_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/joel_3_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/amos_5_13.htm">Amos 5:13</a>, <a href="3927/amos_5_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="3927/amos_5_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7-18</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_14_1.htm">Zechariah 14:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_4.htm">4-21</a>; and elsewhere.</p>
<p>
[3] It is openly stated in Luke that Jehovah Himself came down and took upon Himself human form.<p>Mary said to the angel, How shall this happen, since I have no knowledge of a man? The angel answered her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you, so that the holy thing that is born of you will be called the Son of God, <a href="3927/luke_1_34.htm">Luke 1:34-35</a>.<p>And in Matthew the angel said in a dream to Joseph, who was betrothed to Mary, that that which was born of her was of the Holy Spirit; and Joseph did not know her until she had borne a son, and he called His name Jesus, <a href="3927/matthew_1_20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_1_25.htm">25</a>. The Holy Spirit means the Divine which proceeds from Jehovah God, as will be seen in Chapter 3 of this book. Everyone knows that a child gets its soul and life from the father, its body from the mother. <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
So how could it be more openly stated that the Lord's soul and life were from Jehovah God, and because the Divine cannot be divided, that the Father's Divine itself was His soul and life? That is why the Lord so many times called Jehovah God His Father, and Jehovah God called Him His Son. Can anything more ridiculous be said than the idea that our Lord's soul was from His mother Mary? Yet such is the dream of both Roman Catholics and Protestants today, and they have not woken up to what is said in the Word.<p>

82. (1) Jehovah God descended and assumed a Human that He might redeem men and save them. In the Christian churches at this day it is believed that God the Creator of the universe begat a Son from eternity, and that this Son descended and assumed a Human in order to redeem and save men. But this is an error, and of itself falls to the ground as soon as it is considered that God is one, and that it is worse than incredible in the sight of reason to say that the one God begat a Son from eternity, and that God the Father, together with the Son and Holy Spirit, each one of whom singly is God, is one God. This incredible notion is wholly dissipated, like a falling star in midair, when it is shown from the Word that Jehovah God Himself descended and became Man and also Redeemer.
</p>
<p>
[2] The first statement, that it was Jehovah God Himself who descended and became Man, is made clear in the following passages: <p>Behold, a virgin shall conceive and shall bear a Son, who shall be called God-with-us (<a href="3927/isaiah_7_14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_1_22.htm">Matthew 1:22, 23</a>). <p>Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called Wonderful, God, Mighty, Father of Eternity, the Prince of Peace (<a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). <p>It shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him that He may deliver us; this is Jehovah; we have waited for Him; let us exult and be glad in His salvation (<a href="3927/isaiah_25_9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>). <p>The voice of one crying in the desert, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah; make level in the wilderness a highway for our God, and all flesh shall see it together (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_40_5.htm">5</a>). <p>Behold, the Lord Jehovah cometh in strength, and His arm shall rule for Him behold, His reward is with Him. He shall feed His flock like a shepherd (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">Isaiah 40:10, 11</a>). <p>Jehovah said, Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for lo, I come to dwell in the midst of thee. Then many nations shall cleave to Jehovah in that day (<a href="3927/zechariah_2_10.htm">Zechariah 2:10, 11</a>). <p>I, Jehovah, have called thee in righteousness, and I will give thee for a covenant of the people. I am Jehovah; this is My name; My glory will I not give to another (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6-8</a>). <p>Behold, the days come, that I will raise up unto David a righteous Branch and He shall reign as King, and He shall execute judgment and righteousness in the earth, and this is His name, Jehovah our righteousness (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5, 6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15, 16</a>). <p>See also the places where the Lord's coming is called "the day of Jehovah" (as in <a href="3927/isaiah_13_6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_22.htm">22</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_31_15.htm">Ezekiel 31:15</a>; <a href="3927/joel_1_15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="3927/joel_2_1.htm">2:1, 2</a>, <a href="3927/joel_2_11.htm">11</a>; <a href="3927/joel_3_1.htm">3:1</a>, <a href="3927/joel_3_14.htm">13:14</a>, <a href="3927/joel_3_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/amos_5_13.htm">Amos 5:13</a>, <a href="3927/amos_5_18.htm">15:18</a>, <a href="3927/amos_5_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7-18</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_14_1.htm">Zechariah 14:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_4.htm">4-21</a>; and elsewhere).
</p>
<p>
[3] That it was Jehovah Himself who descended and assumed the Human is especially evident in Luke, where it is said: <p>Mary said to the angel, How shall this come to pass, seeing I know not a man? And the angel answered her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing that is born of thee shall be called the Son of God (<a href="3927/luke_1_34.htm">Luke 1:34, 35</a>). <p>And in Matthew: <p>The angel said to Joseph, the bridegroom of Mary, in a dream, that that which was begotten in her was of the Holy Spirit. And Joseph knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son, and he called His name Jesus (<a href="3927/matthew_1_20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_1_25.htm">25</a>). <p>It will be shown in the third chapter of this work that the Divine that goes forth from Jehovah God is what is meant by the Holy Spirit. Who does not know that the offspring has its soul and life from the father, and that the body is from the soul? Can anything, then, be more plainly declared than that the Lord had His soul and life from Jehovah God; and as the Divine cannot be divided, that the very Divine of the Father was His soul and life? This is why the Lord so often called Jehovah God His Father, and why Jehovah God called Him His Son. Can there be anything, then, more absurd than to say that the soul of the Lord was from His mother Mary? as is at this day dreamed by both the Roman Catholics and the Reformed, they not having yet been awakened by the Word. </p>

<p>
[3] That Jehovah Himself descended and assumed the Human is clearly evident in Luke, where it is written:<p>"Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God" <a href="3927/luke_1_34.htm">Luke 1:34-35</a>.<p>And in Matthew:<p>The angel said to Joseph, the husband of Mary, in a dream, that what was conceived in her was of the Holy Spirit. And Joseph knew her not till she had brought forth her son: "And he called His name Jesus" <a href="3927/matthew_1_20.htm">1:20-25</a>.<p>It will be seen in the third chapter of this work that by the Holy Spirit is meant the Divine which proceeds from Jehovah God. Everyone knows that a child receives his soul and life from his father, and that the body is from the soul. What then is more clearly stated than that the Lord received His soul and life from Jehovah God? And since the Divine cannot be divided, what is more evident than that the Divine itself of the Father was His soul and life? It was for this reason that the Lord so often called Jehovah God His Father, and Jehovah God called Him His own Son. What, then, could one hear more unreasonable than that the soul of our Lord was derived from Mary, His mother, as both Roman Catholics and Protestants at this day affirm, as in a dream, not being as yet awakened by the light of the Word? </p>

82. I. QUOD JEHOVAH DEUS DESCENDERIT ET ASSUMSERIT HUMANUM, UT REDIMERET ET SALVARET HOMINES. In Ecclesiis Christianis hodie creditur, quod Deus Creator Universi genuerit Filium ab aeterno, et quod Hic descenderit et assumserit Humanum ad redimendum et salvandum homines; sed hoc erroneum est, et cadit ex se, dummodo cogitatur, quod Deus unus sit, et quod plus quam fabulosum sit coram ratione quod Deus unus ab aeterno aliquem Filium genuerit, et quoque quod Deus Pater una cum Filio et cum Spiritu Sancto, quorum quisque singulatim Deus est, sit unus Deus; hoc fabulosum prorsus dissipatur, sicut Stella caduca in aerem, dum e Verbo demonstratur, quod Ipse Jehovah Deus descenderit, et Homo factus sit, et quoque Redemptor.</p>
