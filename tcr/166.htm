<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>166</b>. （2）这三者，即父、子和圣灵是一位神的三要素，它们为一，如同灵魂、身体和活动在人里面为一。每个物体都有基本要素和具体要素，二者一起构成一个本质。人的基本要素是他的灵魂、身体和活动，这三者组成一个本质。这可从以下事实看出来：一个来自另一个，因另一个而存在，它们在一个完整的链条中。每个人都始于灵魂，灵魂才是精子的真正本质。<br />灵魂不仅发起、还相继产生身体结构，然后产生从灵魂与身体一起发出的一切事物，也就是所谓的活动。因此，从一个由另一个产生，以及随后的嵌入和联结可以看出，这三者同属一个本质。这就是为何它们被称为三要素。</p>

166. (2)這三——父,子,聖靈, 是一位上帝的三個要素, 是一位; 如同一個人的靈魂,身體,活動, 是一位。
<p>每一個物體都有基本要素和具體要素, 二者構成一個本體。一個人的基本要素是他的靈魂,身體和活動, 這三者聯合組成一個本體。可從這樣的事實看出:一個由另一個引起, 因另一個而存在, 是連鎖關係。每個人由靈魂開始——這是精子的本質, 人發源於此。靈魂不僅是開始, 而且相繼地產生身體的結構。然後, 從靈魂與身體產生了人的活動。因為同一個產生另一個, 又相互嵌入與依附, 可得知這三者同屬於一個本體。這就是為何它們被稱為"三要素"。 </p>

166. 2. These three, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are three essential components of one God. They are one the way our soul, our body, and the things we do are one. In any given thing there are general essential components and there are also specific essential components. The general and specific components combine to make one essence.
<p>In our case, our general essential components are our soul, our body, and the things we do. These three components combine to make one essence, as you can see from the fact that one component comes from and exists for the other in an unbroken chain. We begin from our soul. The soul is the essence of the semen that originates us. Our soul not only initiates but also sequentially produces the features of our body. Then there are the things we do, which come from both our soul and our body. Because one of these components produces another, and therefore the subsequent components are grafted onto and connected to those that came before them, it follows that these three components share one essence. This is why they are called the three essential components. </p>

166. (ii) THOSE THREE, FATHER, SON AND HOLY SPIRIT, ARE THE THREE ESSENTIALS OF A SINGLE GOD, WHICH MAKE ONE AS SOUL, BODY AND ACTIVITY DO WITH A PERSON.<p>Each object has general essentials and particular essentials; and the two together make up a single essence. A person's general essentials are his soul, body and activity. These make up a single essence, as can be seen from the fact that one arises from the next, and exists on account of the next, in an unbroken chain. Every person starts from the soul, which is the true essence of the seed. This not only initiates but also produces one after the other the bodily structures; and later on it initiates the products of the soul and the body working together, what are called its activities. Since then one is produced by the next and by its being implanted and attached, it is plain that these three belong to a single essence. This is why they are called the three essentials. </p>

166. (2) These three, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, are the three essentials of the one God, and they make one as soul, body, and operation make one in man. In any one thing there are both general and particular essentials, and these together make one essence. The general essentials of the one man are his soul, body, and operation. That these constitute one essence can be seen from this-that one is from the other and for the sake of the other in an unbroken series; for man gets his beginning from the soul, which is the very essence of the semen; and the soul not only initiates, but also produces in their order all things that pertain to the body, and afterward all things that proceed from the soul and body together, which are called operations. From this production, therefore, of one from the other, and the consequent ingrafting and conjunction, it can be seen that these three are of one essence, and therefore they are called three essentials. </p>

166. (2) THESE THREE, FATHER, SON AND HOLY SPIRIT, ARE THREE ESSENTIALS OF ONE GOD, WHICH MAKE ONE, AS SOUL, BODY AND OPERATION MAKE ONE IN A MAN.<p>In everything there are general and particular essentials which together constitute one essence. The general essentials of a man are his soul, body and operation; and that these constitute one essence is evident from this fact that one exists from the other, and for the sake of the other, in a continuous series; for a man has his beginning from the soul, which is the very essence of the seed. It, moreover, not only initiates but also produces in its own order the parts of the body, and later the activities, or operations, which result from the co-operation of soul and body. Thus from the production of one from the other, and their interpenetration and conjunction, it is evident that these three are of one essence, and are therefore called three essentials. </p>

166. II. QUOD TRES ILLI, PATER, FILIUS ET SPIRITUS SANCTUS, SINT TRIA ESSENTIALIA UNIUS DEI, QUAE FACIUNT UNUM, QUEMADMODUM ANIMA, CORPUS ET OPERATIO APUD HOMINEM. Dantur Essentialia unius rei communia, et quoque particularia, et haec cum illis faciunt unam Essentiam; Essentialia communia unius hominis, sunt ejus anima, corpus et operatio; quod haec faciant unam Essentiam, videri potest ab hoc, quod unum sit ab altero, et propter alterum, in continua serie, inchoat enim homo ab anima, quae est ipsa essentia seminis; haec non modo initiat, sed etiam producit in suo ordine illa quae corporis sunt, et postea, quae ex duobus illis, anima et corpore simul procedunt, quae vocantur operationes; quare ex productione unius ab altero, et inde insitione et conjunctione, patet quod tria haec sint unius essentiae, quare vocantur tria essentialia. </p>
