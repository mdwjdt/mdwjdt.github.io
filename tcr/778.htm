<h4 align="center">True Christianity #778 (Rose, 2010)
</h4>
<p>
778. All individuals are their own love and their own understanding. Whatever they say and whatever they do carries with it an essence that is drawn from these two essential properties of their life. Therefore angels can recognize the nature of our unique essence on the basis of nothing more than a brief conversation with us. From hearing the tone of our voice angels sense what we love; and from hearing what we say, angels sense our level of understanding.
<p>What makes this possible is that all people have two grand faculties of life within them: their will and their intellect. Their will is a vessel and a dwelling place for their love, and their intellect is a vessel and a dwelling place for their understanding. Therefore all that comes forth from people, whether in the form of actions or words, constitutes the people themselves; their words and actions are the people themselves.
</p>
<p>
[2] In a similar way, but on a much higher level, the Lord is divine love and divine wisdom, or divine goodness and divine truth. His will belongs to divine love, and his divine love belongs to his will; his intellect is divine wisdom, and divine wisdom is his intellect. The human form is a container for these qualities. These points enable us to see how the Lord is the Word.
<p>On the other hand, people who are against the Word, that is, those who oppose the divine truth it contains and therefore oppose the Lord and his church, are their own evil and their own falsity. Both within their minds and in the manifestation of their minds in their bodies, meaning the things they say and do, this is their nature. </p>

778. Every person is his love and his intelligence. Everything which comes from him derives its essence from those two essentials or characteristics of his life. As a result of this angels recognise what a person is like in essence from brief contact with him; they can tell his love from the sound of his voice and his intelligence from what he says. This is because the two universals of anyone's life are his will and his understanding. The will is the receiver and seat of his love, the understanding the receiver and seat of his intelligence. Consequently everything coming from the person, whether action or speech, makes up the person and is the person himself.</p>
<p>
[2] In a similar manner, but in a pre-eminent degree, the Lord is Divine love and Divine wisdom; or, what is the same thing, Divine good and Divine truth. For His will belongs to Divine love, and Divine love belongs to His will; and His understanding is Divine wisdom <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
, and Divine wisdom belongs to His understanding. The human form is their container. These statements will allow one to form some idea of how the Lord is the Word. On the contrary, however, anyone who is against the Word, that is, against the Divine truth in it, and thus against the Lord and His church, is his own evil and his own falsity, both as regards his mind and as regards its effects from the body, effects which relate to actions and utterances.<p>

778. Every man is his own love and his own intelligence, and whatever proceeds from him derives its essence from those two essentials or properties of his life. Therefore the angels, from a brief interaction with a man, recognize what he is essentially; they know his love from the tone of his voice, and his intelligence from his speech. <p>This is because there are two universals of life belonging to every man, the will and the understanding. The will is the receptacle and abode of his love, and the understanding the receptacle and abode of his intelligence. Therefore all things whatever, whether action or speech, that proceed from man, constitute the man and are the man himself. In like manner, but in a preeminent degree the Lord is Divine love and Divine wisdom, or what is the same thing, Divine good and Divine truth; for His will is of the Divine love and the Divine love is of His will, while His understanding is of the Divine wisdom and the Divine wisdom is of His understanding; the Human form is their containant. From this some idea may be formed of how the Lord is the Word. But on the contrary, he who is antagonistic to the Word, that is, to the Divine truth therein, consequently, to the Lord and His church, is his own evil and his own falsity, both in reference to his mind and in reference to the effects thereof, relating to actions and words, which proceed from the body. </p>

<p>
778. Every man is his own love and his own intelligence; and whatever proceeds from him derives its essence from those two essentials as from what belong peculiarly to his life. Therefore the angels know the essential character of a man from brief intercourse with him. They know his love from the tone of his voice, and his intelligence from his speech. For there are two universals of every man's life, the will and the understanding; the will being the receptacle and seat of his love, and the understanding the receptacle and seat of his intelligence. All things, therefore, which proceed from a man, whether action or speech, constitute the man, and are the man himself. Similarly, but in a pre-eminent degree, the Lord is Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, or what is the same, Divine Good and Divine Truth; for His Will is of Divine Love, and Divine Love is of His Will, and His Understanding is Divine Wisdom, and Divine Wisdom is His Understanding; and these are contained in the human form. From this, some idea may be formed of how the Lord is the Word. On the other hand, he who is opposed to the Word, that is opposed to the Divine Truth within it, and consequently opposed to the Lord and His Church, is his own evil and his own falsity, exemplifying both in his mind, and also in his actions and speech which are the body's reaction to the mind's activity. </p>

<p>
778. Unusquisque homo est suus amor et sua intelligentia, et quicquid procedit ex illo, trahit essentiam ex duobus illis essentialibus seu propriis vitae ejus; quapropter Angeli cognoscunt hominem, qualis essentialiter est, ex brevi Commercio cum illo, ex Sono amorem ejus, et ex Sermone intelligentiam ejus; causa est, quia duo universalia vitae cujusvis hominis sunt, voluntas et intellectus, ac Voluntas est receptaculum et habitaculum amoris ejus, ac Intellectus est receptaculum et habitaculum intelligentiae ejus; quare omnia quae procedunt ex homine, sive sit actio sive sermo, faciunt hominem, et sunt ipse homo.</p>

<p>
[2] Simili modo, sed in supereminente gradu, est Dominus Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia, seu quod idem, Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum, nam Voluntas Ipsius est Divini amoris, ac Divinus Amor est Voluntatis Ipsius, et Intellectus Ipsius est Divina Sapientia, ac Divina Sapientia est Intellectus Ipsius; Forma humana est continens illorum; ex his cogitari potest, quomodo Dominus est Verbum. E contrario autem qui est contra Verbum, hoc est, contra Divinum Verum ibi, proinde contra Dominum et Ipsius Ecclesiam, est suum malum et suum falsum, tam quoad mentem, quam quoad hujus effectus e corpore, qui se referunt ad actiones et loquelas. </p>
