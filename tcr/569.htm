569. The third memorable occurrence. Every type of love that is within us exudes a delight by which it makes itself felt. This delight is exuded first into our spirit and then into our body. The delight that comes from our love and the enjoyment that comes from our thinking go together to constitute our life.
<p>As long as we are alive in our earthly bodies, this delight and this enjoyment register only in an obscure way, because our bodies absorb them and dull them. After death, though, when our physical body is taken away and therefore this covering or clothing of our spirit is removed, the delights associated with what we love and the enjoyment associated with what we think are fully felt and perceived. Amazing to say, they are sometimes experienced as odors. This is the mechanism whereby people in the spiritual world are all associated by what they love; this is how heavenly loves bring people together in heaven, and how hellish loves bring people together in hell.
</p>
<p>
[2] In heaven the feelings of delight that come from [angels'] loves are turned into odors like all the kinds of fragrances, sweet smells, pleasant breezes, and delicious sensations that we experience in vegetable gardens, flower gardens, fields, and forests on a morning in spring.
<p>In hell the feelings of delight that come from [devils' and satans'] loves are turned into the kind of foul odors, rotten smells, and stenches given off by outhouses, dead bodies, and ponds full of garbage and sewage. It is astounding, but the devils and satans who are there sense these odors as fragrances, perfumes, and incense that are refreshing to their noses and their hearts.
<p>In the physical world there does exist an association by odors among animals, birds, and crawling insects, but there is not the same association for people, until they have shed their material bodies as a kind of skin.
</p>
<p>
[3] As a result, heaven is most precisely arranged according to all the varieties of love for what is good, and hell, in exactly the opposite way, is arranged according to all the varieties of love for what is evil. This opposition is why there is a great gulf between heaven and hell that cannot be crossed [<a href="3927/luke_16_26.htm">Luke 16:26</a>]. The people who are in heaven cannot stand any of the odor from hell. It causes them nausea and vomiting, and threatens to render them unconscious if they breathe it in. The same thing happens to the people who are in hell, if they cross the midpoint of that great gulf.
</p>
<p>
[4] On one occasion I saw a devil who looked from a distance like a leopard. He had been seen several days earlier among angels of the lowest heaven. He had developed the skill of turning himself into an angel of light, crossing the gulf, standing between two olive trees, and avoiding sensing any odor that would be harmful to his life. He was able to do this because there were no angels present. But as soon as angels arrived, he started having convulsions, and fell down with all his limbs curled up. He looked at that point like a giant snake twisting itself in coils. Eventually he rolled himself down into the gulf. He was picked up by his people and carried into a cave, where he was revived by the heavy stench of his own delight.
</p>
<p>
[5] On another occasion I saw a satan being punished by his own people. I asked why this was, and was told that by holding his nose he had been able to approach people who had the smell of heaven; he had then come back, but his clothes had brought back that smell with him.
<p>It has happened to me several times that when some cave of hell opened up, the stench of a corpse assaulted my nostrils and made me vomit.
<p>All this shows why it is that in the Word, "smell" means perception. It says quite frequently that from people's burnt offerings Jehovah would smell a pleasing aroma. (The oil for anointing and the incense were prepared with fragrant spices [, ].) On the other hand, the children of Israel were commanded to carry unclean things from their camp outside its borders, and they were to dig a hole for their fecal matter and cover it up (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_23_12.htm">Deuteronomy 23:12-13</a>). The reason for this was that the camp of Israel represented heaven and the desert outside their camp represented hell. </p>

569. The third experience.<p>Every love a person has emits a pleasing sensation which allows it to be felt. It is transmitted immediately into the spirit, from where it passes into the body. The pleasure of a person's love together with the beauty of his thought makes up his life. These pleasures and beauties are only dimly felt by a person, so long as he lives in this natural body, for this body absorbs and blunts them. But after death, when the material body is taken away, thus removing the covering or clothing of the spirit, then the pleasures of his love and the beauties of his thought are fully felt and perceived. It is remarkable that they are sometimes perceived as smells. This is the reason why the company all in the spiritual world keep depends upon their loves, those in heaven depending on their loves, and those in hell depending on theirs.</p>
<p>
[2] All the smells, into which the pleasures of loves are turned in heaven, are experienced as the kind of sweet and fragrant smells, the lovely breaths and delightful sensations, which are experienced in gardens, flower-beds, fields and woods in the morning in springtime. The smells, into which the pleasures of the loves of the inhabitants of hell are turned, are experienced as rank, fetid and rotten stenches, such as arise from latrines, corpses and ponds full of garbage and excrement. It is remarkable that to the devils and satans there these smell like balsam, perfumes and incense, which refresh their nostrils and hearts. In the natural world too animals, birds and insects use smells to select their company, but this is not then allowed to human beings, until they have sloughed off their bodies.</p>
<p>
[3] This is why heaven is arranged in the most elaborate order in keeping with all the varieties of love for good, and hell by contraries in keeping with all the varieties of love for evil. It is because of this opposition that there is between heaven and hell a gap that cannot be crossed. For the inhabitants of heaven cannot tolerate any smell from hell, since it causes them nausea and vomiting, and threatens to render them unconscious, if they sniff it. Much the same happens to the inhabitants of hell, if they pass beyond the mid-point of that gap.</p>
<p>
[4] I once saw a devil, who looked from a distance like a leopard - I had seen him a few days before among the angels of the lowest heaven, since he knew how to disguise himself as an angel of light. He was crossing the mid-point and standing between two olive-trees without noticing any smell upsetting to his way of life. The reason was that no angels were present. As soon, however, as they came on the scene, he went into convulsions and fell to the ground with all his limbs contracted. He then appeared like a great snake writhing into coils, and finally rolling down through the gap. He was picked up by his companions and carried off to a cave where the foul smell of his own pleasure revived him.</p>
<p>
[5] Another time too I saw a Satan punished by his companions. I asked the reason, and was told that he had blocked his nostrils and approached those who smelt of heaven, and on coming back brought that smell with him on his clothes. On a number of occasions it has happened that a stench as of a corpse rising from an open cave of hell has assailed my nostrils and made me feel like vomiting.<p>These facts can serve to establish why it is that smelling in the Word means perceiving, It is often stated that Jehovah smelt a welcome odour from burnt-offerings; and that the oil for anointing and incense were made from fragrant substances. On the other hand the Children of Israel were ordered to carry what was unclean in their camp outside the camp, and to bury and cover up their excrement (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_23_12.htm">Deuteronomy 23:12-13</a>). The reason was that the camp of Israel represented heaven, and the desert outside the camp represented hell. </p>

569. Third Memorable Relation: <p>Every love in man breathes forth a delight by which it makes itself felt. It is breathed forth first into the spirit and from that into the body; and the delight of one's love, together with the pleasantness of thought, constitutes his life. This delight and pleasantness are felt by man only obscurely while he lives in the natural body, because that body absorbs and blunts them; but after death, when the material body is laid aside, and the covering or clothing of the spirit thus removed, man has a full sense and perception of these delights of love and pleasantnesses of thought, and, what is wonderful, sometimes even as odors. Because of this, all in the spiritual world are affiliated according to their loves, those in heaven according to theirs, and those in hell according to theirs.
</p>
<p>
[2] The odors into which, in heaven, the delights of loves are turned, are all perceived like the fragrances, sweet smells, pleasant exhalations, and delicious sensations that arise from gardens, flower-beds, fields and forests in the mornings in spring. But the odors into which the delights of the loves of those in hell are turned, are perceived like the pungent, fetid and putrid smells that arise from cesspools, dead bodies, and ponds full of rubbish and ordure; and, what is wonderful, the devils and satans there perceive these smells as balsams, aromatics and frankincense, refreshing their nostrils and hearts. In the natural world it is also given to beasts, birds, and worms to be associated according to odors, but not to men until they have laid aside their bodies as exuviae.
</p>
<p>
[3] On this account heaven is most distinctly arranged in accordance with all the varieties of the love of good, and hell, on the contrary, in accordance with all the varieties of the love of evil. It is owing to this opposition that there is a gulf between heaven and hell which cannot be passed; for those who are in heaven cannot endure any odor from hell, because it excites nausea and vomiting, and threatens them with swooning if they inhale it. The effect is similar upon those who are in hell, if they pass the middle line of that gulf.
</p>
<p>
[4] I once saw a certain devil, who at a distance had the appearance of a leopard (a few days before he had been seen among the angels of the lowest heaven, having the art to make himself an angel of light), who had passed beyond the middle line and was standing between two olive trees, yet did not perceive any odor offensive to his life, for the reason that there were no angels present. But the moment they approached he was seized with convulsions and fell down rigid in all his limbs; and then he appeared like a great serpent drawing himself up in folds, and at length gliding down through the opening, from which he was taken by his companions and carried into a cavern, and there by the rank odor of his own delight he was revived.
</p>
<p>
[5] Again, I once saw a satan punished by his companions. I asked why, and was told that with his nostrils stopped up he had gone near to those who were in the odor of heaven, and had returned and brought that odor with him on his clothing. <p>It has often happened that a putrid odor, like that of corpses, from some open cavern in hell, has painfully touched my nostrils and brought on vomiting. <p>From all this it can be seen why in the Word the sense of smell signifies perception, for it is often said that Jehovah smelled a sweet savor from the burnt-offerings; also that the anointing oil and the incense were made of fragrant substances; and on the other hand the children of Israel were commanded to carry out of their camps what was unclean in them, and to dig down and bury their excrements (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_23_12.htm">Deuteronomy 23:12, 13</a>). This was because the camps of Israel represented heaven, and the desert without the camps represented hell. </p>

<p>
569. The third experience. From every love with man there emanates a delight by which it makes itself felt, first into the spirit and thence into the body; and the delight of a man's love together with the pleasantness of his thought constitutes his life. These delights and pleasures are perceived but dimly by a man so long as he lives in the natural body, because this absorbs and blunts them; but after death, when the material body is put off, and the covering or clothing of the spirit is thus removed, the delights of his love and the pleasures of his thought are then felt and perceived to the full; and what is remarkable, they are sometimes perceived as odors. This is why all in the spiritual world, both in heaven and in hell, are associated according to their respective loves.</p>
<p>
[2] The odors, into which the delights of loves are turned in heaven, are all perceived as the fragrant scents, sweet perfumes, pleasant emanations and delightful perceptions which arise from gardens, flower-beds, fields and woods on spring mornings; but the odors, into which are turned the delights of the loves of those who are in hell, are perceived as the nauseous stenches which arise from cess-pools, dead bodies and stagnant ponds filled with rubbish and filth; and what is also remarkable, the devils and satans there perceive those odors as the perfume of balm, spices and incense, refreshing to their nostrils and hearts. Moreover, in the natural world beasts, birds and insects have the faculty of associating according to their odors; but it is not so with men until they have laid aside their bodies as serpents cast their out-worn skins.</p>
<p>
[3] Hence it is that heaven is arranged with most minute distinctions according to all the varieties of the love of good; and hell, as its opposite, according to all the varieties of the love of evil. Owing to this contrariety, there is between heaven and hell a gulf which cannot be crossed; for those in heaven cannot endure any of the odors of hell, as these cause loathing and sickness and tend to cause swooning, if inhaled. The same happens to those in hell if they pass the middle of that gulf.</p>

<p>
[4] I once saw a certain devil who appeared at a distance like a leopard, and who, a few days before, made his appearance among some angels of the lowest heaven, for he possessed the art of changing into an angel of light. He passed the middle of the gulf and was standing between two olive trees, without being sensible of any odor offensive to him. This was because no angels were present; but as soon as some approached he was seized with convulsions and he fell down with all his limbs contracted. Then he appeared like a great serpent writhing in its coils, and he finally rolled down across the gulf. He was met by his associates and taken to a cavern where he was revived by the offensive odor of his own delight.</p>
<p>
[5] I once also saw a certain satan being punished by his associates. I asked the reason, and was informed that he had stopped his nostrils and approached some who were in the odor of heaven; and on his return had brought back that odor with him on his clothing. Sometimes a foul smell like that of a corpse, coming from some open cavern of hell, has just touched my nostrils and brought on sickness. Hence it may be evident why smelling, in the Word, signifies perception; for it is frequently said that Jehovah smelt a grateful odor from the burnt-offerings; and also that the oil of anointing and incense were prepared from fragrant spices; and on the other hand, why the children of Israel were commanded to carry all unclean things out of the camp; and also to dig a hole for their excrement and cover it in the ground, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_23_12.htm">Deuteronomy 23:12-13</a>. This was because the camp of Israel represented heaven, and the wilderness outside the camp represented hell. </p>

569. TERTIUM MEMORABILE.<p>Omnis Amor apud hominem exspirat jucundum, per quod se facit sentiri, et exspirat id proxime in spiritum, et inde in corpus, et jucundum amoris ejus una cum amaeno cogitationis facit vitam ejus: illa jucunda et amaena non sentiuntur nisi obscure <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
ab homine, quamdiu vivit in Corpore naturali, quia hoc Corpus absorbet et hebetat illa, at post mortem, cum Corpus materiale ablatum est, et sic operimentum seu indumentum spiritus remotum, tunc jucunda amoris et amaena cogitationis ejus plene sentiuntur et percipiuntur, et quod mirabile, quandoque sicut odores; inde est, quod omnes in Mundo Spirituali consocientur secundum amores suos, in Coelo secundum suos, in Inferno secundum suos;</p>
<p>
[2] odores, in quos vertuntur jucunda amorum in Coelo, sentiuntur omnes sicut tales fragrantiae, suaveolentiae, amaenae spirationes, et delitiosae perceptiones, quales sentiuntur in hortis, floretis, agris et sylvis in matutis, tempore veris; odores autem in quos vertuntur jucunda amorum illorum, qui in Inferno sunt, sentiuntur ut nidores, foetores, et putores, quales e latrinis, cadaveribus, et stagnis quisquiliis et sterquilineis oppletis; et quod mirabile, diaboli et satanae ibi sentiunt illa ut balsama, aromata et thura, quae nares et corda illorum refocillant. In Mundo naturali datum etiam est bestiis, avibus et vermibus consociari secundum odores, sed non hominibus tunc, priusquam deposuerint corpora ut exuvias.</p>
<p>
[3] Inde est, quod Coelum distinctissime ordinatum sit secundum omnes varietates amoris boni, ac Infernum ex opposito secundum omnes varietates amoris mali; propter hanc oppositionem est, quod inter Coelum et Infernum sit Hiatus, qui transiri non potest; illi enim qui in Coelo sunt non sustinent aliquem odorem Inferni, excitat enim nauseam et vomitum, et minatur deliquium, si attrahunt; simile fit illis qui in Inferno sunt, si meditullium istius Hiatus transscendunt.</p>
<p>
[4] Quondam vidi aliquem diabolum apparentem e longinquo ut Pardum, qui ante aliquot dies inter Angelos ultimi Coeli visus est, et calluit artem se Angelum lucis facere, transeuntem Meditullium, et stantem inter binas oleas, et non sentientem aliquem odorem vitae suae infestum; causa erat, quia Angeli non aderant; at vero ut primum aderant, convulsionibus actus est, ac decidit quoad omnes artus contractus, et tunc visus est sicut magnus Serpens se contorquens in volvulos, et tandem se per Hiatum devolvens, et exceptus a suis, et deportatus in Cavernam, ubi a graveolente odore sui Jucundi revixit.</p>
<p>
[5] Quondam etiam vidi quendam Satanam punitum a suis; quaesivi causam, et dicebatur, quod ille obturatis naribus accesserit ad illos qui in odore Coeli erant, et quod redierit, et odorem illum super vestibus suis secum tulerit. Aliquoties contigit, quod ex Caverna aliqua Inferni aperta putor sicut cadaveris strinxerit nares meas, et civerit vomitum. Ex his constare potest, unde est, quod in Verbo Olfactus significet perceptionem, nam dicitur saepius, quod Jehovah ex Holocaustis odoratus sit odorem gratum; tum quod Oleum unctionis, et quod Thura parata sint ex fragrantibus: et vicissim, quod mandatum sit filiis Israelis, ut immunda e castris eorum exportarentur extra castra, et quod excrementa alvi defoderent et contegerent, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_23_13.htm">Deuteronomius 23:13-14</a>; <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
causa erat, quia Castra Israelis repraesentabant Coelum, ac Desertum extra castra repraesentabat Infernum.<p>
