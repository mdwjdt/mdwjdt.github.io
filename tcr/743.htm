<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>743</b>. 君主及大臣们的衣服是这样的：君主身穿一件到脚裸的紫色长袍，上面饰有刺绣的银星；里面穿一件闪光的蓝紫色丝绸上衣；在胸前上衣的开口处，可见带有社群徽章的腰带。徽章是一只老鹰，在树顶上孵育她的幼仔；徽章是亮金的，周边镶有钻石。枢密院顾问官的穿着几乎一样，但没有徽章，取而代之的是雕刻的蓝宝石，悬挂在金项链上。大臣们穿着栗色长袍，上面织着一幅鲜花围绕小鹰的图案；里面的上衣是虹彩丝的，短裤和长袜也是。这就是他们的服饰。</p>

743. As for what the prince and the members of his government were wearing: The prince had on a purple robe, decorated with embroidered silver stars. Under the robe he was wearing a vest of shiny blue silk. The vest was open at the chest; underneath you could see the front of his shirt, which bore the insignia of his community. The insignia was an eagle brooding over her chicks at the top of a tree. This image was made with gleaming gold and was surrounded with diamonds. The privy councillors were dressed similarly, although without the insignia. In its place, they wore a braided gold chain around their neck with carved sapphires hanging from it. The courtiers wore robes of light brown, with a decoration of young eagles surrounded by flowers. Their vests, breeches, and stockings were opalescent in color. So these were the kinds of clothes they were wearing. </p>

743. The clothing of the prince and his ministers was like this. The prince wore an ankle-length robe of purple colour, decorated with embroidered silvery stars. Under the robe he wore a tunic of glistening, blue silk; this was open at the chest, where the front of a belt with the emblem of his community was to be seen. The badge was an eagle brooding over its young on a tree-top; it was made of gleaming gold surrounded by diamonds. The privy councillors wore much the same dress, but without the emblem; in its place they had carved sapphires hanging from their necks on a gold chain. The courtiers wore gowns of chestnut colour with a woven pattern of flowers surrounding eaglets; their tunics underneath were of irridescent silk, and so were their breeches and stockings. Such was their clothing. </p>

743. The dress of the prince and his ministers was as follows: The prince was clad in a long robe of a purple color, decorated with silver stars of needlework; under the robe was a tunic of bright violet-colored silk; this was open at the breast where the front part of a belt was visible, bearing the badge of his society. The badge was an eagle on the top of a tree, brooding her young; it was of burnished gold surrounded by diamonds. The privy counselors were clad somewhat in the same way, but without the badge; instead of which they had carved sapphires suspended from their necks by golden chains. The courtiers wore gowns of a brown color, in which were interwoven flowers encircling young eagles; the tunics under these were of opaline silk, as were their breeches and stockings. Such was their clothing. </p>

743. The following is a description of the dress of the prince and his ministers. The prince was dressed in a long purple robe, adorned with silver stars wrought in needlework; and under the robe he wore a blue silk tunic. This was open at the breast where was seen the front part of a sash with the emblem of the society. This was an eagle sitting on her young at the top of a tree, and was made of shining gold, encircled with diamonds. The familiar councilors were similarly dressed, but without the emblem, instead of which they wore carved sapphires, hanging from a golden necklace. The courtiers wore brown cloaks, on which were embroidered flowers encircling young eagles. Beneath these, their silken tunics were of an opaline color, and so also were the garments covering their thighs and legs. Such was their dress. </p>

743. Amictus autem Principis et ejus Ministrorum erat hic: Princeps indutus erat Talari coloris purpurei, insignito stellis acupictis coloris argentei; sub talari cinctus erat tunica ex serico lucente coloris hyacinthini; haec erat circa pectus aperta, ubi anterior pars cujusdam zonae cum Insigni suae Societatis visa est; Insigne erat Aquila super pullis in vertice arboris cubans; hoc erat ex fulgente auro circumcincto adamantibus. Consiliarii a latere erant non dissimiliter amicti, sed absque illo Insigni; loco ejus erant sculpti sapphiri e collo ex aureo torque pendentes. Aulici erant in togis coloris badii, quibus intertexti erant flores circum aquilinos pullos; tunicae sub illis ex serico coloris opalini; similiter femoralia et tibialia. Talis erat Vestitus illorum. </p>
