<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第59节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>59</b>. （4）神是全知，也就是说，祂直觉、看见并知道照着秩序发生的一切事物，直至最细微的细节，并由此直觉、看见并知道违背秩序发生的事物。神是全知，也就是说，祂直觉、看见并知道照着秩序发生的一切事物。原因在于，祂是智慧本身和光本身，智慧本身直觉一切事物，而光本身则看见一切事物。前面说明（37节），神是智慧本身。祂是光本身，因为祂就是天使天堂的太阳，这太阳启示所有人的理解力，无论天使还是人类。因为正如眼睛被尘世之光照亮，理解力也是如此被灵界太阳之光照亮。它不仅凭这光看见，而且还照着对接受这光的热爱而充满聪明智慧，因为这光就其本质而言，就是智慧。因此，我们在大卫诗篇中读到：<br />神住在不可接近的光中。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.2.htm">诗篇104:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/提前6.16.htm">提摩太前书6:16</a>）<br />在启示录：<br />在新耶路撒冷城内，他们不需要灯光，因为主神光照他们。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.23.htm">启示录21:23</a>）<br />在约翰福音：<br />与神同在并且就是神的道照亮一切生在世上的人。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">约翰福音1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.9.htm">9</a>）<br />道（圣言）是指圣智。这就是为何天使越享有更明亮的光，智慧就越大。这也是为何在圣言中，每当提到“光”时，它都表示智慧。</p>

59. (4)上帝是全知。祂意識到,看見,知道下至最細微的一切遵循聖規而發生之事物。並且相對的, 還意識到,看見,知道一切違背聖規而發生之事物。
<p>上帝是全知的, 就是, 祂意識到,看見,知道萬有, 因為祂是智之本和光之本。智之本感知萬有, 光之本看見萬有。
<p>在<a href="37.htm">37</a>節, 我們說明了上帝是智之本。祂是光之本, 因為祂是天國的天陽,照亮一切天人和人類的智力。如同我們的眼睛被世界太陽的光照亮, 我們的智力被心靈世界太陽的光照亮——不僅照亮, 還以智力來填充(取決於我們願意接受的程度), 因為屬靈之光本質上就是智慧。
<p>這就是為何在大衛的詩篇中, 上帝住在不可接近的光中(<a href="3927/psalms_104_2.htm">詩篇104:2</a> ;<a href="3927/1-timothy_6_16.htm">提摩太前書6:16</a>)。就是為何在啟示錄中說, 在新耶路撒冷城內, 他們不需要燈光, 因為主上帝光照他們(<a href="3927/revelation_21_23.htm">啟示錄21:23</a>)。就是為何在約翰福音中說到, 與上帝同在並且是上帝之道就是照亮世上所有人的光(<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">約翰福音1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>)。最後提到的"道"意指智慧。這就是為何天人越有智慧, 就處在更亮的光中。這就是為何在聖言中提到"光"時, 用來表示智慧。 </p>

59. 4. God is omniscient; that is, he is aware of, sees, and knows everything down to the least detail that happens in keeping with the divine design, and by contrast is aware of, sees, and knows what goes against the divine design. God is omniscient, that is, he is aware of, sees, and knows all things, because he is wisdom itself and light itself. Wisdom itself is aware of all things. Light itself sees all things.
<p>We showed above [<a href="37.htm">37</a>] that God is wisdom itself. He is light itself because he is the sun of the angelic heaven that enlightens the intellect of all, both angels and people. As our eye is illuminated by the light of the physical sun, so our intellect is illuminated by the light of the spiritual sun - not only illuminated, but also filled with intelligence (depending on how much we love receiving it), since spiritual light is essentially wisdom.
<p>This is why it says in David that God dwells in inaccessible light [<a href="3927/psalms_104_2.htm">Psalms 104:2</a>; see also <a href="3927/1-timothy_6_16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>]; and why it says in the Book of Revelation that in the New Jerusalem they do not need lamps because the Lord God enlightens them [<a href="3927/revelation_21_23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>]; and why it says in John that the Word that was with God and was God is the light that enlightens everyone who comes into the world [<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>]. The "Word" in this last reference means divine wisdom. This is why the more wisdom angels have, the brighter a light they are in; and why when "light" is mentioned in the Word it means wisdom. </p>

59. (iv) GOD IS OMNISCIENT, THAT IS, HE PERCEIVES, SEES AND KNOWS DOWN TO THE TINIEST DETAIL EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS ACCORDING TO ORDER; AND FROM THESE THINGS ALSO WHAT HAPPENS CONTRARY TO ORDER.<p>The reason God is omniscient, that is, perceives, sees and knows everything is because He is Wisdom itself and Light itself, and Wisdom itself perceives everything and Light itself sees everything. It was shown above that God is Wisdom itself. He is Light itself because He is the sun of the heaven of angels, which sheds light on the understanding of every angel and every person. For as the eye sees by the light of the natural sun, so the understanding sees by the light of the spiritual sun. It not only sees by that light, but is also filled with intelligence the more it loves to receive that light, since this light is in its essence wisdom. Thus we read in the Psalms of David that God dwells in inaccessible light [<a href="3927/psalms_104_2.htm">Psalms 104:2</a>; cf. <a href="3927/1-timothy_6_16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>]; and in Revelation that in the New Jerusalem they have no need of a lamp, because the Lord God sheds light on them [<a href="3927/revelation_21_23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>]; and in John that the Word, which was with God, and was God, is the light, which enlightens every man that comes into the world [<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>]. By the Word is meant the Divine Wisdom. This is why the angels enjoy a brighter light, the greater their wisdom; and why in the Word, every time light is mentioned, wisdom is meant. </p>

59. (4) God is omniscient, that is, He perceives, sees, and knows each thing and all things, even to the most minute, that take place according to order, and from these the things also that take place contrary to order. God is omniscient, that is, perceives, sees, and knows all things, because He is wisdom itself and light itself; and wisdom itself perceives all things, and light itself sees all things. That God is wisdom itself has been shown above; He is light itself because He is the sun of the angelic heaven, which enlightens the understandings of all, both angels and men. For just as the eye is illuminated by the light of the natural sun, so is the understanding illuminated by the light of the spiritual sun nor is it illuminated merely, it is filled with intelligence in accordance with the love of receiving that light, for that light in its essence is wisdom. There fore it is said in David: <p>That God dwells in the light inaccessible (<a href="3927/psalms_104_2.htm">Psalms 104:2</a> comp.<a href="3927/1-timothy_6_16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>); <p>and in the Apocalypse: <p>That in the New Jerusalem they need no candle, for the Lord God giveth them light (<a href="3927/revelation_22_5.htm">22:5</a>); <p>and in John: <p>That the Word, which was with God and was God, is the light that enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world (1<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>) <p>the "Word" meaning the Divine wisdom. For this reason, so far as the angels are in wisdom they are in clearness of light, and for the same reason, whenever light is mentioned in the Word it means wisdom. </p>

59. (4) GOD IS OMNISCIENT, THAT IS, HE PERCEIVES, SEES, AND KNOWS ALL THINGS, EVEN TO THE MOST MINUTE, THAT ARE DONE ACCORDING TO ORDER, AND ALSO FROM THESE WHATEVER IS DONE CONTRARY TO ORDER.<p>God is omniscient, that is, He perceives, sees, and knows all things because He is Wisdom itself and Light itself; and Wisdom itself perceives all things, and Light itself sees all things. That God is Wisdom itself was shown above; and He is Light itself because He is the Sun of the angelic heaven which enlightens the understanding of all, both angels and men. For as the eye is illumined by the light of the natural sun, so is the understanding illumined by the light of the spiritual Sun; and not only illumined but also filled with intelligence according to the love of receiving it, since that light in its essence is wisdom. Therefore in David it is said:<p>that God dwelleth in light inaccessible;<p>and in Revelation:<p>that in the New Jerusalem they have no need of a candle, because the Lord God enlighteneth them.<p>In John also it is said that the Word which was with God, and which was God, is the Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.<p>By the Word is meant Divine Wisdom. The angels therefore enjoy clearness of light in proportion to their wisdom; and therefore also when light is mentioned in the Word wisdom is meant. </p>

59. IV. QUOD DEUS OMNISCIUS SIT, HOC EST, PERCIPIAT, VIDEAT, ET SCIAT OMNIA ET SINGULA USQUE AD MINUTISSIMA, QUAE FIUNT SECUNDUM ORDINEM, ET EX ILLIS ETIAM QUAE FIUNT CONTRA ORDINEM. Quod Deus sit Omniscius, hoc est, percipiat, videat et sciat omnia, est quia est ipsa Sapientia et ipsa Lux, et ipsa Sapientia percipit omnia, et ipsa Lux videt omnia; quod Deus sit ipsa Sapientia, supra ostensum est; quod sit ipsa Lux, est quia est Sol Coeli Angelici, qui omnium tam Angelorum quam hominum intellectum illustrat; nam sicut oculus illuminatur a Luce Solis naturalis, ita intellectus illuminatur a Luce Solis Spiritualis; nec solum illuminatur, sed etiam impletur intelligentia secundum amorem recipiendi illam, quoniam Lux haec in sua essentia est Sapientia; quare apud Paulum <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
dicitur, QUOD DEUS IN LUCE INACCESSIBILI HABITET, <a href="3927/1-timothy_6_16.htm">1 Timotheum 6:16</a>; inque Apocalypsi, Quod in Nova Hierosolyma non opus habeant lucerna, quia Dominus Deus illustrat illos [<a href="3927/revelation_21_23.htm">21:23</a>]: et apud Johannem, "Quod Verbum, quod erat apud Deum, et erat Deus, sit Lux, quae illuminat omnem hominem venientem in Mundum," [<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">Johannes 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>], per Verbum intelligitur Divina Sapientia. Inde est, quod Angeli, quantum in sapientia sunt, tantum in candore lucis sint: et inde quoque est, quod in Verbo, ubi nominatur Lux, intelligatur sapientia.<p>
