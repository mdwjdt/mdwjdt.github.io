<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>370</b>.⑵与父神结合是不可能的，只能与主结合，并通过主与父神结合。这一点既是圣经的教导，也能凭理性被看到。圣经教导：从来没有人见过或听到过父神，也不可能见到或听到祂；因此，祂也无法通过祂自己的事物，诸如祂在自己的存在和实体中的那一类而作用于人。因为主说：<br />这不是说有人看见过父，惟独从神来的，他看见过父。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.46.htm">约翰福音6:46</a>）除了父，没有人知道子；除了子和子所愿意指示的，没有人知道父。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.27.htm">马太福音11:27</a>）<br />你们从来没有听见祂的声音，也没有看见祂的形像。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.37.htm">约翰福音5:37</a>）<br />这是因为，祂在万物的最初和起始中，因而远远超出人类心智所能触及的范畴；因为祂在全部的爱和全部智慧的最初和起始中，人无法与这些结合。所以，若祂靠近人，或人靠近祂，人必被销毁湮灭，就象把一片木头放到超级取火镜的焦点上，确切地说，就象把一尊雕像扔进太阳中。这就是为何摩西渴望见到神时，被告知：见祂面的不能存活（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出33.20.htm">出埃及记33:20</a>）。<br />从上述经文明显可知，通过主与父神结合是有可能的。这些经文表明，并非父，而是父怀中见过父的独生子，阐明并揭示属于神和来自神之物。此外，这一点从以下经文明显可知：<br />到那日你们就知道我在父里面，你们在我里面，我也在你们里面。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">约翰福音14:20</a>）<br />你所赐给我的荣耀，我已赐给他们，使他们都合而为一，像我们合而为一。我在他们里面，你在我里面。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.22.htm">约翰福音17:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.26.htm">26</a>）<br />耶稣说：“我就是道路、真理、生命。若不藉着我，没有人能到父那里去。”腓力想见父，但主对他说：“人看见了我，就是看见了父；若认识我，也就认识我的父”。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">约翰福音14:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.7.htm">7</a>等等）<br />人看见我，就是看见那差我来的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.45.htm">约翰福音12:45</a>）<br />此外，主说祂是门，从祂进去的得救，从其它地方爬进去的是贼，是强盗（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.1.htm">约翰福音10:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.9.htm">9</a>）。祂还说，人若不常在祂里面，就会被丢在门外，像枯枝那样被扔进火里（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.6.htm">约翰福音15:6</a>）。<br />这是因为，主我们的救主就是人形的耶和华父祂自己；耶和华降世成为人，以便祂能接近人，人也能接近祂，从而建立联结，并通过联结赋予人救恩和永生。因为当神成为人，因而人也成为神时，祂通过调节自己以适合人而能靠近人，并作为神－人和人－神（God－man and Man－god）与人结合。依次有三个步骤：调节、适合和结合。适合之前必须要有调节；结合之前必须要有调节和适合这二者一起。神通过成为人而完成调节；而神这一方的适合是永恒不变的，只需人反过来使自己适合；只要这一切成就，就会产生结合。这三个步骤环环相扣、井然有序地在一切细节中进行，它们合为一体，同时共存。</p>

370. (2)不可能與父上帝聯合, 只有可能與主聯合, 通過祂與父上帝聯合。
<p>聖言中如此教導, 以理性也可看出這一點。聖言教導, 父上帝從未被人看見或聽見, 也見不到或聽不到。結果, 從祂而來的(正如祂在祂的根本和本質之中), 沒有什麼對人能起作用。因為主說:
<p>這不是說,有人看見過父,惟獨從上帝來的,他看見過父(<a href="3927/john_6_46.htm">約翰福音6:46</a>)。除了父,沒有人知道子。除了子和子所願意指示的,沒有人知道父(<a href="3927/matthew_11_27.htm">馬太福音11:27</a>)。你們從來沒有聽見他的聲音,也沒有看見他的形像(<a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">約翰福音5:37</a>)。
<p>其原因在於, 父上帝是萬有的根本與起源, 遠遠超出人類思想可及的範圍。祂也是一切與仁愛和智慧相關事物的根本與起源, 人無法與這些發生聯合的關係。因此, 倘若祂接近人, 或者人接近祂, 將被銷毀湮滅, 如同把一小片木塊扔進一大片火海之中, 或者把一尊雕像扔進太陽裡面。這就是為何摩西渴望見到上帝時, 他被告知:見祂面的不能存活(<a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">出埃及記33:20</a>)。
<p>[2]從以上引述的經文可得知, 通過主來與父建立聯合的關係是有可能的。並非父, 而是父懷中,見過父面的獨生子, 揭露並展現了上帝的以及源自上帝的事物。以下經文也可看出, 人可以通過主來與父上帝建立連接:
<p>到那日你們就知道我在父裡面,你們在我裡面,我也在你們裡面(<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">約翰福音14:20</a>)。你所賜給我的榮耀,我已賜給他們,使他們合而為一,像我們合而為一; 我在他們裡面,你在我裡面(<a href="3927/john_17_22.htm">約翰福音17:22-23</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>)。耶穌說:"我是道路,真理,生命。若不借著我, 沒有人能到父那裡去。"腓力想見父, 但是主回答他:"人看見了我, 就是看見了父; 若認識我, 也就認識了父"(<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">約翰福音14:6-7</a>及之後)。人看見我, 就是看見那差我來的(<a href="3927/john_12_45.htm">約翰福音12:45</a>)。
<p>此外, 主還說祂是門, 由祂進去的得救, 從其它地方爬進去的是盜賊(<a href="3927/john_10_1.htm">約翰福音10:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">9</a>)。祂還說, 不在祂裡面的, 會像枯枝被扔進火裡(<a href="3927/john_15_6.htm">約翰福音15:6</a>)。
<p>[3]這是因為, 我們的救主就是耶和華自己在人的形式中。耶和華降世成為人, 為的是能接近人,人能接近祂, 因而相互的連接關係得以建立, 藉此連接賜給人們拯救與永生。當上帝成為人,人成為上帝時, 祂便有能力以如此形式——神人與人神(God-man and Man-god), 來與人接近, 並與他們聯合。
<p>對此, 有三個依次排列的順序:適應,請求與聯合。在請求之前, 必須適應; 在聯合可能發生之先, 必有適應與請求的發生。適應的階段, 通過上帝成為人來達成。上帝的請求始終如一, 直到人自己請求; 輪到人自己請求時, 聯合就發生。這三個階段按照次序接續發生, 環環相扣, 應用於一切細節。 </p>

</h4>
<p>
370. (b) It is impossible for us to have a partnership with God the Father. What is possible is a partnership with the Lord, and through the Lord, with God the Father. Scripture teaches this and reason sees it. Scripture teaches that God the Father never has been seen or heard, and never could be. As a result, nothing from him such as he is in his own essential underlying reality could have an effect on us. The Lord says,
<p>No one has seen God except the One who is with the Father. He has seen the Father. (<a href="3927/john_6_46.htm">John 6:46</a>)
<p>No one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son is willing to reveal him. (<a href="3927/matthew_11_27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>)
<p>You have never heard the voice of the Father or seen what he looks like. (<a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>)
<p>The reason for this is that God the Father is in the first principles and beginnings of all things. Therefore he transcends the entire reach of the human mind. He is in the first principles and beginnings of all things related to wisdom and all things related to love. No partnership is possible between those first principles and us. Therefore if he were to come near us or we were to go near him, we would be consumed and liquefied like a piece of wood at the focus of a huge burning mirror; or better yet like a carved statue thrown into the sun itself. This is why Moses, who longed to see God, was told that we cannot see God and live (<a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] The passages that I just quoted make it clear that we form a partnership with God the Father through the Lord. It was not the Father, it was the only begotten Son who is close to the Father's heart and has seen the Father, who disclosed and revealed the things that are of God and from God. The following passages also show that we form a partnership with God the Father through the Lord: "On that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you are in me and I am in you" (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>). "The glory that you gave me, I have given them so that they may be one as we are one - I in them and you in me" (<a href="3927/john_17_22.htm">John 17:22-23</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>). Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. " Then Philip wanted to see the Father, but the Lord replied, "Those who see me also see the Father, and those who know me also know the Father" (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6-7</a>, and following). Elsewhere we read, "Those who see me see the One who sent me" (<a href="3927/john_12_45.htm">John 12:45</a>).
<p>In addition, the Lord says that he is the door, and that those who enter through him are saved, but those who climb up some other way are thieves and robbers (<a href="3927/john_10_1.htm">John 10:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">9</a>). He also says, "Those who do not live in me will be thrown out and put in the fire like a withered branch" (<a href="3927/john_15_6.htm">John 15:6</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] The reason is that the Lord our Savior is Jehovah the Father himself in human form. Jehovah came down and became human so that he could come close to us and we could come close to him, and a partnership could be forged, through which we could have salvation and eternal life. When God became human and then a human became God, he became able to draw near us in this adapted form and, as a human God and a divine Human, forge a partnership with us.
<p>There are three stages to this that follow in sequence: adjusting to one another, coming closer together, and then forging a partnership. The adjustment has to happen before the two parties can come closer together, and both the adjustment and the coming closer have to happen before a partnership can be forged. The adjustment on God's part was to become human. God is perpetually coming closer to the extent that we are coming closer to him. And as this takes place, a partnership is forged. For each and every set of things that become one and share their existence, these three stages happen in this sequence and proceed in this order. </p>

370. (ii) A link is impossible with God the Father, but it is possible with the Lord, and through Him with God the Father.<p>This is taught by Scripture and is to be seen by the reason. Scripture teaches that God the Father has never been seen or heard, and cannot be seen or heard either; nor likewise can anything from Him, such as He is in His being and His essence, work upon man. For the Lord says:<p>No one has seen God, except Him who is with the Father; He has seen the Father, <a href="3927/john_6_46.htm">John 6:46</a>.<p>No one knows the Father, except the Son, and any to whom the Son has wished to reveal Him, <a href="3927/matthew_11_27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>.<p>You have never heard the Father's voice, nor have you seen His appearance, <a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>.<p>The reason is that He is in the first principles and beginnings of everything, and so is far and away above any level attainable by the human mind. For He is in the first principles and beginnings of the whole of wisdom and the whole of love, and with these man can have no link. Therefore if He should approach a person, or a person should approach Him, he would be consumed and dissolved, like a piece of wood in the focus of a large burning glass, or rather like an image thrown into the sun itself. That is why Moses was told, when he desired to see God, that man cannot see Him and live (<a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>).</p>
<p>
[2] It is evident from the passages just quoted that a link is possible with God the Father through the Lord. These state that it is not the Father, but the only-begotten Son, who is in the Father's bosom and has seen the Father, who has expounded and revealed what is of God and from God. Moreover, it is evident from the following.:<p>On that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you are in me and I am in you, <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>.<p>I have given them the glory which you gave me, so that they might be one, as we are one; I in them and you in me, <a href="3927/john_17_22.htm">John 17:22-23</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>.<p>Jesus said, I am the way, truth and life. No one comes to the Father except through me. And then Philip wished to see the Father, but the Lord answered him, He who sees me sees the Father also, and he who knows me knows the Father also, <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6-7</a>ff.<p>Elsewhere:<p>He who sees me sees Him who sent me, <a href="3927/john_12_45.htm">John 12:45</a>.<p>Moreover He says that He is the door, and he who enters by Him is saved, and he who climbs up another way is a thief and a robber (<a href="3927/john_10_1.htm">John 10:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">9</a>). He also says that he who does not remain in Him is cast out of doors, and thrown into the fire like a withered branch (<a href="3927/john_15_6.htm">John 15:6</a>).</p>
<p>
[3] This is because the Lord our Saviour is Jehovah the Father himself in human form; for Jehovah came down and became man, so that He could approach men and men could approach Him, thus establishing a link, and by the link give men salvation and everlasting life. For when God became man, and so man also became God, then by adapting Himself suitably He could approach men, and be linked with them as God-man and Man-god. There are three stages which follow in sequence: adaptation, application and linking. There must be adaptation before there can be application; and there must be adaptation and application together before linking is possible. Adaptation was achieved by God by becoming man. Application by God is constant, in so far as man in turn applies himself; and as this happens, so linking takes place. These three stages follow and proceed in their proper sequence in all details, which become one and come into existence together. </p>

370. (2) Conjunction with God the Father is not possible, but only conjunction with the Lord, and through Him with God the Father. This the Scripture teaches and reason sees. The Scripture teaches that God the Father has never been seen or heard, and cannot be seen or heard; consequently that from Himself, as He is in His own Esse and Essence, He cannot operate at all in man. For the Lord says, <p>That no man hath seen God save He that is with the Father, He hath seen the Father (<a href="3927/john_6_46.htm">John 6:46</a>). <p>Neither knoweth anyone the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal Him (<a href="3927/matthew_11_27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>). <p>Ye have neither heard the voice of the Father at any time nor seen His Shape (<a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>). <p>This is because He is in the firsts and the principles of all things, thus pre-eminently above every sphere of the human mind; for He is in the firsts and the principles of all things of wisdom and all things of love, with which man can have no conjunction whatever; consequently if He Himself should draw near to man, or man to Him, man would be consumed and would melt away like wood in the focus of a powerful sun-glass, or rather like an image thrown into the sun itself. Therefore it was said to Moses, who longed to see God, <p>That man could not see Him and live (<a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] But that there may be conjunction with God the Father through the Lord, is evident from the passages just quoted, that not the Father, but the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, and who has seen the Father, has brought to view and revealed those things which are of God and from God; and also from the following: <p>In that day ye shall know that I am in My Father, and ye in Me, and I in you (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>). <p>The glory which Thou hast given Me, I have given unto them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and Thou in Me (<a href="3927/john_17_22.htm">John 3:22, 23</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>). <p>Jesus said, I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no one cometh unto the Father but by Me. And then Philip wished to see the Father, and the Lord said to him, He that seeth Me seeth the Father; and if ye had known Me, ye would know My Father also (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6, 7</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_9.htm">9</a>). <p>Again: <p>He that beholdeth Me, beholdeth Him that sent Me (<a href="3927/john_12_45.htm">John 12:45</a>). <p>He also said: <p>That He is the door, and that whosoever enters through Him is saved while he who climbeth up some other way is a thief and a robber (<a href="3927/john_10_1.htm">John 10:1-9</a>). <p>He also says, <p>That he who abides not in Him, is cast forth and as a branch is withered, and cast into the fire (<a href="3927/john_15_6.htm">John 15:6</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] This is because the Lord our Savior is Jehovah the Father Himself in human form; for Jehovah descended and became Man that He might be able to draw near to man, and man to Him, and conjunction might thus be effected, and through that conjunction man might have salvation and eternal life. For when God became Man, and thus also became Man-God, being then accommodated to man He could draw near to him and be conjoined with him as God-Man and Man-God. There are three things that follow in order; accommodation, application, and conjunction. There must be accommodation before there is application; and there must be accommodation and application both together before there is conjunction. Accommodation on God's part was that He became Man; application on God's part is perpetual so far as man applies himself in return; and so far as this is done, conjunction is effected also. These three follow each other and proceed in their order in each and all things, which become one and coexist. </p>

370. (2) There cannot be conjunction with God the Father, but with the Lord, and through Him with God the Father. This truth Scripture teaches and reason sees. Scripture teaches that God the Father has never been either seen or heard, and cannot be; consequently that nothing can take place in man from Him, as He is in His Being and in His Essence; for the Lord says,<p>that no man has seen God, save He who is with the Father, "He hath seen the Father" <a href="3927/john_6_46.htm">John 6:46</a>.<p>"Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him" <a href="3927/matthew_11_27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>.<p>"Ye have neither heard the Father's (A.V., His) voice at any time, nor seen His shape" <a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>.<p>This is because He is in the beginnings and first principles of all things, and thus He completely transcends the whole sphere of the human mind. For He is in the beginnings and first principles of all things relating to wisdom and love with which a man cannot possibly have conjunction. If, therefore, God should draw near to man, or man to Him, the man would be consumed and dissipated like a piece of wood in the focus of a huge burning-glass, or rather like an image cast into the sun itself. Thus when Moses desired to see God he was told:<p> no man could see God and live, <a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] That there is conjunction with God the Father through the Lord is evident from the passages just quoted, affirming that the things which are of God and from God have been declared and revealed not by the Father, but by the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, and who has seen the Father. It is also evident from the following passages:<p>"At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you" <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>.<p>"The glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in thee, and thou in me" <a href="3927/john_17_22.htm">John 17:22-23</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>.<p>"Jesus saith... I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me;" And then Philip wished to see the Father, but the Lord answered him, saying that he who seeth Him seeth the Father also, and that he who knoweth Him knoweth the Father also, <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6-7</a> and following verses;<p>and in another place,<p>"He that seeth me seeth Him that sent me" <a href="3927/john_12_45.htm">John 12:45</a>.<p>Further He says,<p>that He is the door, and that he who enters in by Him shall be saved; but that he who climbs up by some other way is a thief and a robber, <a href="3927/john_10_1.htm">John 10:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">9</a>;<p>and also,<p>"If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth" and is cast into the fire as a withered branch, <a href="3927/john_15_6.htm">John 15:6</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] The reason is that the Lord our Savior is Jehovah the Father Himself in human form. For Jehovah descended and became Man, that He might be able to draw near to man, and man to Him; thus that there might be conjunction, and that by conjunction man might have salvation and eternal life. For when God became Man, becoming also Man-God, He was then accommodated to man and able to draw near to him, and to be conjoined with him as God-Man and Man-God. Now there are three things which follow in order, namely, accommodation, application, and conjunction. There must be accommodation before there can be application, and there must be accommodation and application together before there can be conjunction. There was accommodation on the part of God when He became Man; application (or effort towards conjunction) on the part of God is perpetually adjusted to the effort put forth by man; and conjunction is effected in so far as this effort is mutual. These three things follow and make progress in their own order; and they do so in all things, in general and in particular, that become one, and exist together. </p>

[2] Quod autem Deus Pater conjungatur per Dominum, constat ex mox allatis, quod <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
non Pater, sed Unigenitus Filius, qui in sinu Patris est et vidit Patrem, illa quae Dei et a Deo sunt, exposuerit et revelaverit; et insuper ex his, In die illo cognoscetis, quod Ego in Patre meo, et vos in Me et Ego in vobis, <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">Johannes 14:20</a>. Ego gloriam, quam dedisti Mihi, dedi illis, ut sint unum, sicut nos unum sumus, Ego in illis, et Tu in Me, <a href="3927/john_17_22.htm">Johannes 17:22-23</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>. Jesus dixit, Ego sum Via, Veritas, et Vita, nemo venit ad Patrem, nisi per Me: et tunc Philippus voluit videre Patrem, cui Dominus respondit, Qui Me videt, etiam Patrem videt, et qui <sup "fn120_5">5</sup>
me cognoscit etiam Patrem cognoscit, <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">Johannes 14:6-7</a>, seq., et alibi, Qui videt Me, videt Ipsum qui misit Me, <a href="3927/john_12_45.htm">Johannes 12:45</a>. Ac insuper dicit, Quod sit Janua, et quod qui per Ipsum ingreditur, salvetur, et quod qui ascendit aliunde, sit fur et latro, <a href="3927/john_10_1.htm">Johannes 10:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">9</a>. Et quoque dicit, quod qui non manet in Me, ejicietur foras, et sicut palmes arefactus in ignem conjicietur, <a href="3927/john_15_6.htm">Johannes 15:6</a>.</p>

[3] Causa est, quia Dominus noster Salvator, est Ipse Jehovah Pater in Forma humana; Jehovah enim descendit, et Homo factus est, ut accedere posset ad hominem, et homo ad Ipsum, et sic fieret conjunctio, et per conjunctionem homini salus et vita aeterna; quando enim Deus factus est Homo, et sic quoque factus Homo Deus, tunc accommodatus <sup "fn120_6">6</sup>
ad hominem potuit accedere, et ei conjungi ut Deus Homo et Homo Deus. Sunt tria quae sequuntur ordine, ACCOMMODATIO, APPLICATIO, et CONJUNCTIO; Accommodatio erit, antequam datur Applicatio, atque Accommodatio et simul Applicatio, antequam datur Conjunctio; Accommodatio a parte Dei fuit, quod factus sit Homo; Applicatio a parte Dei est perpetua, quantum homo se applicat vicissim; et sicut hoc fit, etiam fit Conjunctio. Haec tria sequuntur <sup "fn120_7">7</sup>
et procedunt in suo ordine, in omnibus et singulis, quae unum fiunt et coexistunt.<p>
