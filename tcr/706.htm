<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>706</b>.主的“血”表祂的圣真和圣言真理，原因在于，祂的“肉”在灵义上表爱之圣善，这二者在祂里面被结合起来。众所周知，主是圣言，圣言中的一切事物皆指向这二者，即圣善与圣真。故，如果我们用“圣言”代替“主”，那么很明显，这二者以祂的肉与血来表示。“血”表主的圣真，或圣言真理，这一点从众多经文明显可知，如，血被称为“立约的血”，因为“约”表结合，主藉其圣真成就该结合，如在撒迦利亚书：<br />我因与你立约的血，将你从无水的坑中释放出来。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.11.htm">9:11</a>）<br />摩西五经：<br />当摩西将律法书说与百姓听时，他将血的一半洒在百姓身上，说，你看，这是立约的血，是耶和华按这一切话与你们立约的凭据。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.3.htm">出埃及记24:3</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.8.htm">8</a>）<br />耶稣拿起杯来，递给他们，说，这是我立新约的血。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.27.htm">马太福音26:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.28.htm">28</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.24.htm">马可福音14:24</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.20.htm">路加福音22:20</a>）<br />立新约或立约的血没有别的意思，只表圣言（即被称为誓约或圣约的旧约与新约），因而表圣言的圣真。由于这就是“血”的含义，所以主将酒赐给祂的门徒，说：“这是我的血”，“酒”表圣真，因此酒被称为：葡萄汁（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.11.htm">创世记49:11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.14.htm">申命记32:14</a>）。<br />这一点从主的话更明显可知：<br />我实实在在地告诉你们：你们若不吃人子的肉，不喝人子的血，就没有生命在你们里面。我的肉真是可吃的，我的血真是可喝的。吃我肉、喝我血的人常在我里面，我也常在他里面。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.53.htm">约翰福音6:53</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.58.htm">58</a>）.<br />显而易见，这里的“血”表圣言的圣真，因为经上说，凡喝它的人在自己有生命，常在主里面，主也常在他里面。在教会众所周知，这是圣真和照之生活的果效，圣餐强化这个果效。<br />由于“血”表主的圣真，亦即圣言的圣真，由于这就是所谓新旧约，所以在以色列人中，血是教会最神圣的代表，在该教会，一切细节都是某种属世物与属灵物的对应。例如，他们取了点血，涂在吃羊羔的房屋左右的门框上和门楣上，以免灾殃临到他们身上（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.7.htm">出埃及记12:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.22.htm">22</a>）。<br />燔祭的血要洒在坛的四围，弹到亚伦与他儿子，及其衣服上。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.12.htm">出埃及记29:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.20.htm">20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.21.htm">21</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利1.6.htm">利未记1:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利1.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利1.16.htm">16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利3.2.htm">3:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利3.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利3.19.htm">19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.26.htm">4:26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.30.htm">30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.34.htm">34</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利8.16.htm">8:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利8.24.htm">24</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利17.8.htm">17:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民18.17.htm">民数记18:17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.27.htm">申命记12:27</a>）<br />以及约柜的幔子、施恩座与香坛的四角上。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.8.htm">利未记4:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.12.htm">16:12</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.15.htm">15</a>）<br />启示录中，羔羊的血有同样的含义：<br />这些人用羔羊的血把衣裳洗白净了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.14.htm">7:14</a>）<br />还有这段经文：<br />在天上就有了争战，米迦勒同他的使者与龙争战，他们用羔羊的血和自己所见证的道胜过他。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.7.htm">12:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.11.htm">11</a>）<br />米迦勒同他的使者若不藉圣言中主的圣真战胜那龙，是不可想象的。因为天上的天人不会想到什么血，也不会想到主的受难，而只想到圣真和主的复活。故，当人思想主的血时，天人觉察到的是其圣言的圣真；当人思想主的受难时，他们觉察到的是祂的荣耀，然后只觉察到祂的复活。我蒙允许通过大量经历获知这一点。<br />“血”表圣真，这一点从以下诗篇经文也清楚可知：<br />神要拯救穷苦人的性命，他们的血在祂眼中看为宝贵；他们要存活，祂要赐给他们示巴的金子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.13.htm">诗篇72:13</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“在神眼中宝贵的血”表在他们里面的圣真，“示巴的金子”表由此而来的智慧。<br />以西结书：<br />你们聚集到以色列山上献大祭之地，好叫你们吃肉喝血。你们必喝地上首领的血，你们甚至必喝醉了血，我必显我的荣耀在列邦中。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.17.htm">39:17</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.21.htm">21</a>）<br />这段经文阐述了主即将在列邦中建立的教会。这里的“血”并非表示真的血，而是指他们所拥有的圣言真理，如刚才所述。</p>

<p>
706. 主的“血”表祂的圣真和圣言真理, 原因在于, 祂的“肉”在灵义上表爱之圣善, 这二者在祂里面被结合起来。 众所周知, 主是圣言, 圣言中的一切事物皆指向这二者, 即圣善与圣真。 故, 如果我们用“圣言”代替“主”, 那么很明显, 这二者以祂的肉与血来表示。 “血”表主的圣真, 或圣言真理, 这一点从众多经文明显可知, 如, 血被称为“立约的血”, 因为“约”表结合, 主藉其圣真成就该结合, 如在撒迦利亚书:<p>我因与你立约的血, 将你从无水的坑中释放出来。 (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_11.htm">撒迦利亚9:11</a>) <p>摩西五经:<p>当摩西将律法书说与百姓听时, 他将血的一半洒在百姓身上, 说, 你看, 这是立约的血, 是耶和华按这一切话与你们立约的凭据。 (<a href="3927/exodus_24_3.htm">出埃及记24:3-8</a>) <p>耶稣拿起杯来, 递给他们, 说, 这是我立新约的血。 (<a href="3927/matthew_26_27.htm">马太福音26:27-28</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_24.htm">马可福音14:24</a>;<a href="3927/luke_22_20.htm">路加福音22:20</a>) <p>立新约或立约的血没有别的意思, 只表圣言 (即被称为誓约或圣约的旧约与新约), 因而表圣言的圣真。 由于这就是“血”的含义, 所以主将酒赐给祂的门徒, 说: “这是我的血”, “酒”表圣真, 因此酒被称为: 葡萄汁 (<a href="3927/genesis_49_11.htm">创世记49:11</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_14.htm">申命记32:14</a>)。 <p>这一点从主的话更明显可知:<p>我实实在在地告诉你们: 你们若不吃人子的肉, 不喝人子的血, 就没有生命在你们里面。 我的肉真是可吃的, 我的血真是可喝的。 吃我肉, 喝我血的人常在我里面, 我也常在他里面。 (<a href="3927/john_6_53.htm">约翰福音6:53-58</a>)。 <p>显而易见, 这里的“血”表圣言的圣真, 因为经上说, 凡喝它的人在自己有生命, 常在主里面, 主也常在他里面。 在教会众所周知, 这是圣真和照之生活的果效, 圣餐强化这个果效。 <p>由于“血”表主的圣真, 亦即圣言的圣真, 由于这就是所谓新旧约, 所以在以色列人中, 血是教会最神圣的代表, 在该教会, 一切细节都是某种属世物与属灵物的对应。 例如, 他们取了点血, 涂在吃羊羔的房屋左右的门框上和门楣上, 以免灾殃临到他们身上 (<a href="3927/exodus_12_7.htm">出埃及记12:7</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_12_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_12_22.htm">22</a>)。 <p>燔祭的血要洒在坛的四围, 弹到亚伦与他儿子, 及其衣服上。 (<a href="3927/exodus_29_12.htm">出埃及记29:12</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_29_16.htm">16</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_29_20.htm">20-21</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_1_6.htm">利未记1:6</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_1_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_1_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_3_2.htm">3:2</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_3_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_3_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_4_26.htm">4:26</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_30.htm">30</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_34.htm">34</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_8_15.htm">8:15</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_8_24.htm">24</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_17_6.htm">17:6</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_18_17.htm">民数记18:17</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_27.htm">申命记12:27</a>) <p>以及约柜的幔子, 施恩座与香坛的四角上。 (<a href="3927/leviticus_4_8.htm">利未记4:8</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_17.htm">17-18</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_16_12.htm">16:12-15</a>) <p>启示录中, 羔羊的血有同样的含义:<p>这些人用羔羊的血把衣裳洗白净了。 (<a href="3927/revelation_7_14.htm">启示录7:14</a>) <p>还有这段经文:<p>在天上就有了争战, 米迦勒同他的使者与龙争战, 他们用羔羊的血和自己所见证的道胜过他。 (<a href="3927/revelation_12_7.htm">启示录12:7</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_11.htm">11</a>) <p>米迦勒同他的使者若不藉圣言中主的圣真战胜那龙, 是不可想象的。 因为天上的天人不会想到什么血, 也不会想到主的受难, 而只想到圣真和主的复活。 故, 当人思想主的血时, 天人觉察到的是其圣言的圣真; 当人思想主的受难时, 他们觉察到的是祂的荣耀, 然后只觉察到祂的复活。 我蒙允许通过大量经历获知这一点。 <p>“血”表圣真, 这一点从以下诗篇经文也清楚可知:<p>神要拯救穷苦人的性命, 他们的血在祂眼中看为宝贵; 他们要存活, 祂要赐给他们示巴的金子。 (<a href="3927/psalms_72_13.htm">诗篇72:13-16</a>) <p>“在神眼中宝贵的血”表在他们里面的圣真, “示巴的金子”表由此而来的智慧。 <p>以西结书:<p>你们聚集到以色列山上献大祭之地, 好叫你们吃肉喝血。 你们必喝地上首领的血, 你们甚至必喝醉了血, 我必显我的荣耀在列邦中。 (<a href="3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">以西结39:17-21</a>) <p>这段经文阐述了主即将在列邦中建立的教会。 这里的“血”并非表示真的血, 而是指他们所拥有的圣言真理, 如刚才所述。 </p>

<p>
706. "The Lord's blood" means the divine truth that belongs to him and to the Word, because the spiritual meaning of his flesh is the divine goodness of his love; these two are united in the Lord.
<p>It is well known that the Lord is the Word. There are two things to which all the details in the Word relate: divine goodness and divine truth. Therefore if we substitute "the Word" for "the Lord," it is clear that his flesh and blood mean divine goodness and divine truth.
<p>There are many passages that establish that blood means the divine truth that belongs to the Lord or the Word. For example, his blood is called "the blood of the covenant," and a covenant means a partnership. It is by means of his divine truth that the Lord forges a partnership with us. See, for example, Zechariah: "By the blood of your covenant I will release the prisoners from the pit" (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_11.htm">Zechariah 9:11</a>). In Moses, "After Moses had read the book of the Law in the hearing of the people, he sprinkled half the blood upon the people and said, 'Behold, the blood of the covenant that Jehovah has forged with you through all these words'" (<a href="3927/exodus_24_3.htm">Exodus 24:3-8</a>). "And Jesus took the cup and gave it to them and said, 'This is my blood of the new covenant'" (<a href="3927/matthew_26_27.htm">Matthew 26:27-28</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_24.htm">Mark 14:24</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] The "blood of the new covenant" or "testament" means the Word, which is called a Covenant and a Testament, both the Old and the New; therefore it means the divine truth that is there. Because blood has this meaning, the Lord gave his disciples wine and said, "This is my blood" [<a href="3927/matthew_26_28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_24.htm">Mark 14:24</a>]; wine means divine truth. Therefore wine is also called "the blood of grapes" (<a href="3927/genesis_49_11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>).
<p>The Lord's words make this clearer still:
<p>Truly, truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Humankind and drink his blood, you will not have life within you. My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink. Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood live in me and I in them. (<a href="3927/john_6_50.htm">John 6:50-58</a>)
<p>Blood here means the divine truth of the Word, as is very clear because it says that those who drink it have life within them and live in the Lord and he lives in them. As people within the church are capable of knowing, divine truth and a life according to it are what allow the Lord to be in us and us in the Lord; the Holy Supper strengthens these effects.
</p>
<p>
[3] Since blood means the Lord's divine truth, which is also the divine truth of the Word, and this is the Old and New Covenant or Testament itself, therefore blood was the holiest symbolic substance in the church that existed among the children of Israel - a church whose every detail was a correspondence of something earthly with something spiritual. For example, they took the blood of the Passover lamb and put it on the doorposts and the lintel of their houses, to keep the plague from coming upon them (<a href="3927/exodus_12_7.htm">Exodus 12:7</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_12_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_12_22.htm">22</a>). The blood of the burnt offering was sprinkled on the altar, on its base, and on Aaron and his sons and on their garments (<a href="3927/exodus_29_12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_29_16.htm">16</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_29_20.htm">20-21</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_1_5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_1_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_1_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_3_2.htm">3:2</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_3_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_3_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_4_25.htm">4:25</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_30.htm">30</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_34.htm">34</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_8_15.htm">8:15</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_8_24.htm">24</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_17_6.htm">17:6</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_18_17.htm">Numbers 18:17</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_27.htm">Deuteronomy 12:27</a>). Blood was also sprinkled in front of the veil that was before the ark, on the mercy seat there, and on the horns of the altar of incense (<a href="3927/leviticus_4_6.htm">Leviticus 4:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_17.htm">17-18</a>; ).
<p>The "blood of the Lamb" mentioned in the Book of Revelation has the same meaning: "They washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (<a href="3927/revelation_7_14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>). So does the following statement in the same book: "War broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and conquered it by the blood of the Lamb and by the Word of their testimony" (<a href="3927/revelation_12_7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_11.htm">11</a>).
</p>
<p>
[4] There is no basis for thinking that Michael and his angels were able to conquer the dragon through anything other than the Lord's divine truth in the Word.
<p>The angels in heaven are unable to think about any blood or about the Lord's suffering; they think instead about the divine truth and about his resurrection. When we think about the Lord's blood, angels think instead about the divine truth of the Lord's Word; when we think about the Lord's suffering, they think instead about the Lord's glorification, focusing exclusively on his resurrection. A great deal of experience has allowed me to know that this is the case.
</p>
<p>
[5] The fact that blood means divine truth is also clear from the following statements in David: "God will save the souls of the needy; their blood will be precious in his sight. And they will live; and he will give them some of the gold of Sheba" (<a href="3927/psalms_72_13.htm">Psalms 72:13-15</a>). The blood that is precious in the sight of God stands for the divine truth that is among the people [meant by "the needy"]; the gold of Sheba is the wisdom they develop as a result.
<p>In Ezekiel: "Gather yourselves to a great sacrificial meal on the mountains of Israel, so that you will eat flesh and drink blood. You will drink the blood of the leaders of the earth, and drink blood until you are drunk. This is how I will present my glory among the nations" (<a href="3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17-21</a>). This passage deals with the church that the Lord is going to establish among the nations. (On the point that the word "blood" here cannot mean blood, but must mean the truth from the Word that exists among them, see just above [705].) </p>

<p>
706. The reason why the Lord's blood means His Divine truth and that of the Word is that His flesh means in the spiritual sense the Divine good of love, and these two are made one in the Lord. It is well known that the Lord is the Word; and there are two things to which everything in the Word has reference, Divine good and Divine truth. If therefore the Word is substituted for the Lord, it is plain that it is these two which are meant by His flesh and blood. It is established from many passages that blood means the Divine truth of the Lord or of the Word; for instance, from blood being called the blood of the covenant, since a covenant is a link, and linking is effected by the Lord by means of His Divine truth. Also in Zechariah:<p>By the blood of your covenant I shall release the captives from the pit, <a href="3927/zechariah_9_11.htm">Zechariah 9:11</a>.<p>And in the works of Moses:<p>After Moses had read the book of the law for the people to hear <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
, he sprinkled half the blood upon the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which Jehovah has made with you upon all these words, <a href="3927/exodus_24_3.htm">Exodus 24:3-8</a>.<p>Also:<p>Jesus taking the cup gave it to them, saying, This is my blood, the blood of the new covenant, <a href="3927/matthew_26_27.htm">Matthew 26:27-28</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_24.htm">Mark 14:24</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] The blood of the new covenant or testament cannot mean anything but the Word, which is called an old and a new covenant or testament, and so the Divine truth it contains. It is because blood has this meaning that the Lord gave them wine, saying, 'This is my blood'; and wine stands for Divine truth. For this reason it is also called 'the blood of grapes' (<a href="3927/genesis_49_11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>). This is plainer still from the Lord's words:<p>Truly, truly, I tell you: if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in you. For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood, remains in me and I in him, <a href="3927/john_6_50.htm">John 6:50-58</a>.<p>It is perfectly obvious that blood here means the Divine truth of the Word, because it is said that he who drinks it has life in himself, and remains in the Lord, and the Lord remains in him. It ought to be well known in the church that this is the effect of Divine truth and living in accordance with it, and that the Holy Supper strengthens this effect.</p>
<p>
[3] It is because blood stands for the Lord's Divine truth, which is also the Divine truth of the Word, and because this is what the old and new covenants and testaments are, that blood was the holiest representative of the church among the Children of Israel. In that church every detail was a correspondence of something natural with something spiritual. For instance, they were to take some of the blood of the Passover and put it on the door-posts and lintels of their houses, to ensure the plague would not come upon them (<a href="3927/exodus_12_7.htm">Exodus 12:7</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_12_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_12_22.htm">22</a>).<p>The blood of the burnt offering was to be sprinkled over the altar, right to its foundations, and over Aaron, his sons and their clothes (<a href="3927/exodus_29_12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_29_16.htm">16</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_29_20.htm">20-21</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_1_5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_1_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_1_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_3_2.htm">3:2</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_3_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_3_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_4_25.htm">4:25</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_30.htm">30</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_34.htm">34</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_8_15.htm">8:15</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_8_24.htm">24</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_17_6.htm">17:6</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_18_17.htm">Numbers 18:17</a> <sup "fn10_2">2</sup>
; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_27.htm">Deuteronomy 12:27</a>). Also over the veil above the Ark, over the mercy-seat there, and over the horns of the incense altar (<a href="3927/leviticus_4_6.htm">Leviticus 4:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_17.htm">17-18</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_16_12.htm">16:12-15</a>). The blood of the Lamb stands for something similar in Revelation:<p>These have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, <a href="3927/revelation_7_14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>.<p>Also in these words from the same book:<p>War broke out in heaven, Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and they defeated him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their <sup "fn10_3">3</sup>
witness, <a href="3927/revelation_12_7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_11.htm">11</a>.</p>
<p>
[4] It is impossible to think that Michael and his angels defeated the dragon by anything but the Lord's Divine truth in the Word. For angels in heaven cannot think about any blood, nor do they think about the Lord's passion; but they think of Divine truth and His resurrection. When therefore a person thinks about the Lord's blood, the angels perceive the Divine truth of His Word. When he thinks about the Lord's passion, they perceive His glorification, and then only His resurrection. I have been allowed to know by long experience that this is so.</p>
<p>
[5] It is also plain from this passage in the Psalms of David that blood stands for Divine truth:<p>God will save the souls of the needy. Their blood will be precious in His eyes, and they will live and He will give them of the gold of Sheba, <a href="3927/psalms_72_13.htm">Psalms 72:13-16</a>.<p>Blood being precious in God's eyes stands for Divine truth being with them; the gold of Sheba is wisdom coming from this. Also in Ezekiel:<p>Gather for the great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, so that you may eat flesh and drink blood; you will drink the blood of the princes of the earth, and you will drink blood until you are drunk. Thus shall I set my glory among the nations, <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17-21</a>.<p>This deals with the church which the Lord is to found among the gentiles. Blood cannot here mean blood, but the truth from the Word they possess; see just above.<p>

706. The Lord's "blood" means His Divine truth and the truth of the Word, because His "flesh," spiritually understood, means the Divine good of love, and in Him these two are united. It is known that the Lord is the Word, and there are two things to which everything in the Word has relation, Divine good and Divine truth, if therefore, instead of "the Lord" we say "the Word," it is clear that these two are meant by His flesh and blood. That "blood" means the Lord's Divine truth or the truth of the Word is evident from many passages, as, for example, where blood is called "the blood of the covenant," "covenant" meaning conjunction, which is effected by the Lord by means of His Divine truth; as in Zechariah: <p>By the blood of thy covenant I will send forth the bound out of the pit (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_11.htm">9:11</a>). <p>And in Moses: <p>When Moses had read the book of the law in the ears of the people, he sprinkled half of the blood upon the people and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which Jehovah hath concluded with you upon all these words (<a href="3927/exodus_24_3.htm">Exodus 24:3-8</a>). <p>And Jesus took the cup and gave to them, saying, This is My blood of the new covenant (<a href="3927/matthew_26_27.htm">Matthew 26:27, 28</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_24.htm">Mark 14:24</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] By the blood of the new covenant or testament nothing is meant but the Word, (which is called the covenant or testament, old and new), thus Divine truth in the Word. As this is the significance of "blood," the Lord gave His disciples the wine, saying, "This is My blood," "wine" signifying Divine truth, and therefore wine is called: <p>The blood of grapes (<a href="3927/genesis_49_11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>). <p>This is still further evident from the Lord's words: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you; for My flesh is truly meat, and My blood is truly drink. He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood abideth in Me and I in him (<a href="3927/john_6_53.htm">John 6:53-58</a>). <p>That "blood" here means the Divine truth of the Word, is very manifest for it is said, that he who drinks it hath life in himself, and abideth in the Lord and the Lord in him; that this is effected by Divine truth and a life according to it, and that the holy supper confirms it, may be known in the church.
</p>
<p>
[3] As "blood" signifies the Lord's Divine truth, which is also the Divine truth of the Word, (and this is the real covenant or testament, old and new), therefore among the children of Israel blood was the holiest representative of their church, wherein each thing and all things were correspondences of natural with spiritual things. For example. <p>They were to take of the paschal blood and put it on the two side posts and on the upper door-posts of the houses, lest the plague should come upon them (Ex.<a href="3927/exodus_12_7.htm">12:7</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_12_13.htm">12:13</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_12_22.htm">12:22</a>). <p>And the blood of the burnt-offering was to be sprinkled upon the altar on the bottom of it, on Aaron and his sons, and on their garments (<a href="3927/exodus_29_12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_29_16.htm">29:16</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_29_20.htm">29:20-21</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_1_6.htm">Leviticus 1:6</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_1_11.htm">Leviticus 1:11</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_1_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_3_2.htm">3:2</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_3_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_3_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_4_25.htm">4:25</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_30.htm">30</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_34.htm">34</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_8_15.htm">8:15</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_8_24.htm">24</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_17_6.htm">17:6</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_18_17.htm">Numbers 18:17</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_27.htm">Deuteronomy 12:27</a>). <p>Also on the veil over the ark, on the mercy-seat there, and on the horns of the altar of incense (<a href="3927/leviticus_4_6.htm">Leviticus 4:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_17.htm">17-18</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_16_12.htm">16:12-15</a>). <p>in the Apocalypse the blood of the Lamb has a similar significance: <p>These have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb (<a href="3927/revelation_7_14.htm">7:14</a>). <p>Also in this passage: <p>There was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and they overcame him through the blood of the Lamb and through the word of their testimony, (<a href="3927/revelation_12_7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>,<a href="3927/revelation_12_11.htm">12:11</a>).
</p>
<p>
[4] For it cannot be imagined that Michael and his angels overcame the dragon by any other means than the Lord's Divine truth in the Word, for the angels of heaven cannot think of any kind of blood, nor do they think of the Lord's passion, but only of Divine truth and of the Lord's resurrection. So when man thinks of the Lord's blood, the angels have a perception of the Divine truth of His Word; and when men think of the Lord's passion, they have a perception of His glorification, and then of His resurrection only. This I have been permitted to learn from much experience.
</p>
<p>
[5] That "blood" signifies Divine truth is clear also from the following passages in David: <p>God shall save the souls of the needy, and precious shall their blood be in His eyes; and they shall live, and He will give them of the gold of Sheba (<a href="3927/psalms_72_13.htm">Psalms 72:13-16</a>); <p>"blood precious in the eyes of God" meaning the Divine truth in them; and "the gold of Sheba" wisdom therefrom. And in Ezekiel: <p>Gather yourselves to the great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel that ye may eat flesh and drink blood; ye shall drink the blood of the princes of the earth, and ye shall drink blood even to drunkenness, and I will set My glory among the heathen (<a href="3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">39:17-21</a>). <p>This treats of the church which the Lord was about to establish among the nations. That "blood" here cannot mean blood, but the truth from the Word which they had may be seen just above. </p>

706. The Divine Truth of the Lord and of the Word is meant by His blood, because the Divine Good of Love is spiritually meant by His flesh; and these two are united in Him. It is well known that the Lord is the Word; and there are two things to which all the contents of the Word relate, namely, Divine Good and Divine Truth. Therefore, if the Word is taken to mean the Lord, it is evident that Divine Good and Truth are meant by His flesh and blood. That the Divine Truth of the Lord, or of the Word is meant by blood, is evident from numerous passages, as those in which blood was called the blood of the covenant; for a covenant signifies conjunction, and conjunction is effected by the Lord by means of His Divine Truth, as in Zechariah:<p>"By the blood of thy covenant I will send forth (A.V., have sent) thy prisoners out of the pit" <a href="3927/zechariah_9_11.htm">9:11</a>;<p>and in Moses;<p>After Moses had read the book of the law in the ears of the people, he sprinkled half of the blood on the people, and said, "Behold the blood of the covenant which JEHOVAH hath made with you concerning all these words" <a href="3927/exodus_24_3.htm">Exodus 24:3-8</a>.<p>And Jesus "took the cup... and gave it to them, saying... This is my blood of the new covenant (A.V., testament)" <a href="3927/matthew_26_27.htm">Matthew 26:27-28</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_24.htm">Mark 14:24</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] The blood of the new covenant or testament signifies the Word, which is called a covenant and a testament, both old and new, thus the Divine Truth contained in it. Since this is signified by blood, therefore the Lord gave His disciples the wine, saying, "This is my blood." Wine signifies Divine Truth, and therefore it is also called:<p>"The blood of grapes" <a href="3927/genesis_49_11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>.<p>This is still more evident from the Lord's words,<p>"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you... For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him" <a href="3927/john_6_50.htm">John 6:50-58</a>.<p>It is plainly evident that the Divine Truth of the Word is here meant by blood; for it is said that he that drinks has life in himself, and dwells in the Lord, and the Lord in him. It may be known in the Church that the Divine Truth and a life according to it bring this about, and that the Holy Supper confirms it.</p>
<p>
[3] As blood signified the Divine Truth of the Lord, which is also the Divine Truth of the Word, and as this is the covenant itself and testament, both old and new, therefore, blood was the most holy representative in the Israelitish Church, in which all things, in general and in particular, were correspondences of natural with spiritual things. Thus the Israelites were told:<p>That they were to take of the paschal blood, and strike it upon the side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, lest the plague should come upon them, <a href="3927/exodus_12_7.htm">Exodus 12:7</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_12_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_12_22.htm">22</a>;<p>That the blood of the burnt-offering was to be sprinkled upon the altar at its base; and upon Aaron, and upon his sons, and upon their garments, <a href="3927/exodus_29_12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_29_16.htm">16</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_29_20.htm">20-21</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_1_5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_1_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_1_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_3_2.htm">3:2</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_3_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_3_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_4_25.htm">4:25</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_30.htm">30</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_34.htm">34</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_8_15.htm">8:15</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_8_24.htm">24</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_17_6.htm">17:6</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_18_17.htm">Numbers 18:17</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_27.htm">Deuteronomy 12:27</a>; and also upon the veil, which was over the ark, upon the mercy-seat there, and upon the horns of the altar of incense, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_6.htm">Leviticus 4:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_4_17.htm">17-18</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_16_12.htm">16:12-15</a>.<p>The blood of the Lamb in the Revelation has a similar signification:<p>"These have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" <a href="3927/revelation_7_14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>,<p>and also in this passage:<p>"There was war in heaven: Michael <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
and his angels fought against the dragon... and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony," <a href="3927/revelation_12_1.htm">Revelation 12</a>.</p>
<p>
[4] It cannot be supposed that Michael and his angels overcame the dragon by any other means than the Divine Truth of the Lord in the Word; for the angels in heaven cannot think of any blood, nor do they think of the Lord's passion, but of Divine Truth, and of His resurrection. Therefore, when a man thinks of the Lord's blood, the angels perceive the Divine Truth of His Word; and when he thinks of the Lord's passion, they have a perception of His glorification, and then only of His resurrection. It has been granted me to know by long experience that this is so.</p>
<p>
[5] That blood signifies Divine Truth, is evident also from these words in David:<p>God "shall save the souls of the needy... and precious shall their blood be in His sight. And they (A.V., he) shall live, and He shall give them (A.V., and to him shall be given) of the gold of Sheba" <a href="3927/psalms_72_13.htm">Psalms 72:13-16</a>.<p>The blood that is precious in the sight of God signifies the Divine Truth that they possess; and the gold of Sheba is the wisdom derived from it. So in Ezekiel:<p>"Assemble yourselves... to a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood... Ye shall drink the blood of the princes of the earth... and shall drink blood till ye be drunken... And I will set my glory among the nations (A.V., heathen)" <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">39:17-21</a>.<p>The prophet here speaks of the Church which the Lord was about to establish among the nations. It has just been shown above that blood cannot here mean blood, but truth from the Lord which the nations possess.<p>

706. Quod per Sanguinem Domini intelligatur Divinum Verum Ipsius et Verbi, est quia per Carnem Ipsius spiritualiter intelligitur Divinum Bonum amoris; et haec duo in Domino unita sunt.

Sanguis pretiosus in oculis Dei pro Divino Vero apud illos; Aurum Schebae est sapientia inde; et apud Ezechielem, "Congregate vos ad Sacrificium magnum super montibus Israelis, ut comedatis Carnem et bibatis Sanguinem; Sanguinem principum terrae bibetis, et bibetis Sanguinem usque ad ebrietatem; sic dabo gloriam meam inter gentes," <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">Ezechiel 39:17-21</a>, agitur ibi de Ecclesia quam Dominus apud Gentes instauraturus est; quod per Sanguinem hic non possit intelligi Sanguis, sed Verum ex Verbo apud illos, videatur mox supra.<p>
