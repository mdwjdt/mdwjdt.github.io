488. “神预定人进地狱”这一无人性的观念, 就好比某些野蛮民族中的残忍父亲, 将他们尚在襁褓中的婴孩丢到大街上; 或好比不人道的敌人将他们所杀戮的尸体扔到森林喂食野兽。 它还好比暴君将治下的百姓分类, 有的交给刽子手, 有的扔进深海, 有的投入火中。 它又好比吞吃自己幼崽的凶残野兽, 以及扑向镜中自己映像的疯狗。 </p>

<p>
488. The belief that God predestines people to hell is savage. It can be compared with the savagery of parents in some barbaric cultures who throw their nursing babies out into the streets. It is like the savagery of some enemies who throw the bodies of people they have killed into the woods to be eaten by wild animals. It is like the cruelty of a tyrant who divides the people under him into groups and sends some groups to the executioners, hurls some groups into the depths of the sea, and throws other groups into the fire. It is like the rage that drives some wild animals to eat their own young. It is also like the insanity of dogs that suddenly attack their own reflection in a mirror. </p>

488. The unnatural belief that God predestines people to hell can be compared with the unnatural behaviour of fathers in some savage nations, who throw their own unweaned babies and children out into the streets; and with the unnatural behaviour of some enemies, who throw the bodies of those they have killed out in the woods for wild beasts to devour. It can also be compared with the cruelty of a tyrant, who divides the people under his control into groups, and some groups he hands over to executioners, some he throws into deep water at sea, and some into fire. It can also be compared with the ferocity of some wild animals which devour their own young; and with the madness of dogs which fly at their own reflexions seen in a mirror. </p>

488. The inhuman belief that God predestinates man to hell, may be likened to the inhumanity of fathers among certain barbarous races, who cast their sucklings and infants into the streets; or to the inhumanity of some warriors who throw their slain into forests to be devoured by wild beasts. It may also be likened to the cruelty of a tyrant, who divides a people he has subdued into classes, giving some of them to the hangman, throwing some into the depths of the sea, and some into the fire. It may also be likened to the fury of some wild beasts, which devour their own young; and also to the madness of dogs that fly at the reflection of themselves in a minor. </p>

<p>
488. This cruel belief that God predestines men to hell may be compared to the cruelty of fathers among barbarous nations, who cast out their sucking children and infants into the streets; and to that of certain enemies who throw the bodies of the slain into woods to be devoured by wild beasts. It may also be compared to the cruelty of a tyrant who divides a conquered people into companies, some of whom he delivers up to the executioner, some he casts into the sea, and some he consigns to the flames. It may also be compared to the fury of certain wild beasts which devour their young; and with the madness of dogs which fly at their own reflection in a mirror. </p>

488. Immanis fides, quod Deus praedestinet homines ad Infernum, comparari potest cum immanitate patrum apud quasdam barbaras gentes, qui lactentes <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
et infantes suos ejiciunt in plateas: et cum immanitate quorundam hostium, qui homines interfectos projiciunt in sylvas a belluis devorandos. Comparari etiam potest cum crudelitate tyranni, qui populum sibi subditum dividit in turmas, et ex his quasdam tradit carnificibus, quasdam projicit in profundum maris, et quasdam in ignem. Comparari etiam potest cum rabie quarundam ferarum, quae devorant suos pullos: et quoque comparari potest cum insania canum, qui involant in imagines suas visas in speculo.<p>
