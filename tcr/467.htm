467. In the Word the Garden of Eden does not mean some garden but a state of understanding; and a tree does not mean some tree but a human being. You can see that the Garden of Eden means understanding and wisdom from the following passages: "With your understanding and wisdom you had made wealth for yourself"; and in the following verses there: "Full of wisdom, you were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was your covering" (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">12-13</a>). These things are said of the prince and of the king of Tyre. The king is said to possess wisdom because Tyre in the Word means the church's concepts of truth and goodness, which lead to wisdom. The precious stones that cover him also mean these concepts of truth and goodness. The prince and the king of Tyre were not in the Garden of Eden.
</p>
<p>
[2] Elsewhere in Ezekiel: "Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon. The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it. No tree in the garden of God was equal to it in beauty. All the trees of Eden in the garden of God were jealous of it" (<a href="3927/ezekiel_31_3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_31_8.htm">8-9</a>). And again: "To which among the trees of Eden did you become comparable in glory and size?" (<a href="3927/ezekiel_31_18.htm">Ezekiel 31:18</a>). This is said of Assyria, because in the Word Assyria means rationality and understanding.
</p>
<p>
[3] In Isaiah: "Jehovah will comfort Zion and turn her wilderness into Eden, and her desert into the garden of Jehovah" (<a href="3927/isaiah_51_3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>). Zion here means the church; Eden and the garden of Jehovah mean wisdom and understanding. In the Book of Revelation: "To those who overcome I will give [food] to eat from the tree of life, which is in the middle of the paradise of God" (<a href="3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>). "In the middle of the street [and] of the river, on this side and that, will be the tree of life" (<a href="3927/revelation_22_2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>).
</p>
<p>
[4] From these verses it is very clear that the garden in Eden in which Adam was placed means understanding and wisdom, because similar things are said about Tyre, Assyria, and Zion.
<p>Elsewhere in the Word as well, a garden means understanding; for example, in <a href="3927/isaiah_58_11.htm">Isaiah 58:11</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_61_11.htm">61:11</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_12.htm">Jeremiah 31:12</a>; <a href="3927/amos_9_14.htm">Amos 9:14</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_24_6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>. A garden has this spiritual meaning because of symbolic representations in the spiritual world. In that world, garden paradises appear wherever there are angels who have understanding and wisdom; the understanding and wisdom they have from the Lord causes such things to appear around them. This occurs because of correspondence, for all things that exist in the spiritual world are correspondences. </p>

<p>
467. In the Word the Garden of Eden does not mean a garden, but intelligence, and a tree does not mean a tree, but man. The Garden of Eden can be shown to mean intelligence and wisdom from the following passages:<p>In your intelligence and wisdom you made riches for yourself. <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4</a>.<p>and in the continuation of this chapter:<p>Full of wisdom, you were in Eden, God's garden; every kind of precious stone was your covering, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-13</a>.<p>This is said of the prince and king of Tyre, to whom wisdom is attributed, because Tyre in the Word means the church in respect of knowledge of truth and good, which is the means to wisdom. The precious stones which are to be his covering also mean things known about truth and good; for the prince and king of Tyre were not in the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>
[2] In another passage in Ezekiel:<p>Asshur is a cedar in Lebanon. The cedars have not hidden it in the garden of God. All the trees in the garden of God were not its equal in beauty; all the trees of Eden in the garden of God envied it, <a href="3927/ezekiel_31_3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_31_8.htm">8-9</a>.<p>And further on:<p>To whom you thus became like in glory and size among the trees of Eden, <a href="3927/ezekiel_31_18.htm">Ezekiel 31:18</a>.<p>This is said of Asshur, because in the Word Asshur means rationality and intelligence arising from this.</p>
<p>
[3] In Isaiah:<p>Jehovah will comfort Zion, and turn its desert into an Eden and its wilderness into a garden of Jehovah, <a href="3927/isaiah_51_3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>.<p>Zion there is the church, Eden and the garden of Jehovah are wisdom and intelligence. In Revelation:<p>To him who overcomes I will grant to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise <sup "fn10_2">2</sup>
of God, <a href="3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>.<p>In the midst of the street, on either side of the river was the tree of life, <a href="3927/revelation_22_2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>.</p>
<p>
[4] These passages show plainly that the garden in Eden, in which we are told Adam was placed, means intelligence and wisdom, because similar things are said of Tyre, Asshur and Zion. A garden also means intelligence in other passages of the Word, such as <a href="3927/isaiah_58_11.htm">Isaiah 58:11</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_61_11.htm">61:11</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_12.htm">Jeremiah 31:12</a>; <a href="3927/amos_9_14.htm">Amos 9:14</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_24_6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>. This spiritual way of understanding a garden is due to the representations seen in the spiritual world. There parks are to be seen, wherever angels possess intelligence and wisdom; it is the intelligence and wisdom themselves, which they get from the Lord, which produce such appearances around them. This is due to the correspondence, because everything which comes into being in the spiritual world is an example of correspondence.<p>

467. "The garden of Eden" in the Word does not mean a garden, but intelligence, nor does "tree" mean any tree, but man. That "the garden of Eden" signifies intelligence and wisdom, can be seen from the following passages: <p>In thy wisdom and thine intelligence thou hast made to thyself wealth (Ezekiel 28:4). <p>Also in what follows: <p>Full of wisdom, thou has been in Eden the garden of God, every precious stone was thy covering (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">12, 13</a>). <p>This is said of the prince and king of Tyre, of whom wisdom is predicated, because "Tyre" in the Word signifies the church in respect to knowledges of truth and good through which comes wisdom; "the precious stones" which were his covering, also signify knowledges of truth and good; for the prince and the king of Tyre were not in the garden of Eden.
</p>
<p>
[2] And again in Ezekiel: <p>Asshur a cedar in Lebanon. The cedars in the garden of God have not hidden it. No tree in the garden of God was like unto it in its beauty. All the trees of Eden in the garden of God envied it (<a href="3927/ezekiel_31_3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>, 8<a href="3927/ezekiel_31_8.htm">, 31:8-9</a>). <p>And again: <p>To whom art thou thus become like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? (verse<a href="3927/ezekiel_31_18.htm">18</a>). <p>This is said of Assyria, because in the Word it signifies rationality and intelligence therefrom.
</p>
<p>
[3] In Isaiah: <p>Jehovah shall comfort Zion, He will turn her desert into Eden, and her wilderness into the garden of Jehovah (<a href="3927/isaiah_51_3.htm">51:3</a>). <p>Here "Zion" means the church, and "Eden" and "the garden of Jehovah" mean wisdom and intelligence. In the Apocalypse: <p>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God (<a href="3927/revelation_2_7.htm">2:7</a>). <p>In the midst of the street, and on either side of the river, there will be the tree of life (<a href="3927/revelation_22_2.htm">22:2</a>).
</p>
<p>
[4] From these passages it is clear that "the garden of Eden" in which Adam is said to have been placed, means intelligence and wisdom, because like thing are said of Tyre, Assyria, and Zion. Elsewhere in the Word "garden" signifies intelligence (as in Isaiah<a href="3927/isaiah_58_11.htm">58:11</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_61_11.htm">61:11</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_12.htm">Jeremiah 31:12</a>; <a href="3927/amos_9_14.htm">Amos 9:14</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_24_6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>). This spiritual meaning of a garden derives its cause from representations in the spiritual world, where paradises are seen wherever the angels are in intelligence and wisdom; the very intelligence and wisdom which they possess from the Lord cause such things to be present about them; and this comes from correspondence, for all things that exist in the spiritual world are correspondences. </p>

467. In the Word, the Garden of Eden means not any particular garden, but intelligence, and a tree, not any particular tree, but man. The Garden of Eden signifies intelligence and wisdom, as is evident from these passages:<p>"With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches... Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God"<p>and also from these words:<p>"Full of wisdom. . . Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering" <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">12-13</a>.<p>This is spoken of the prince and king of Tyre of whom wisdom is predicated, because Tyre in the Word signifies the Church as to the knowledge of good and truth by which wisdom is attained. The precious stones which were his covering also signify the knowledge of truth and good, for the prince and king of Tyre were not in the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>
[2] Elsewhere in Ezekiel it is said:<p>"Asshur (A.V., the Assyrian) was a cedar in Lebanon... The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him... nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty... all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him" <a href="3927/ezekiel_31_3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_31_8.htm">8-9</a>;<p>and further:<p>"To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden?" verse 18.<p>This is said of Asshur, because Asshur in the Word signifies rationality and consequent intelligence.</p>
<p>
[3] In Isaiah it is written:<p>"JEHOVAH shall comfort Zion... He will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of JEHOVAH" <a href="3927/isaiah_2_3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>.<p>Zion in this passage is the Church, and Eden and the garden of Jehovah are wisdom and intelligence. In the Revelation it is written:<p>"To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God" <a href="3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>.<p>"In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life" <a href="3927/revelation_22_2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>.</p>
<p>
[4] From these passages it is quite clear that the Garden of Eden, in which Adam is said to have been placed, means intelligence and wisdom, because similar things are said of Tyre, Asshur and Zion. A garden also signifies intelligence in other parts of the Word,<p>as in <a href="3927/isaiah_58_11.htm">Isaiah 58:11</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_61_11.htm">61:11</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_12.htm">Jeremiah 31:12</a>; <a href="3927/amos_9_14.htm">Amos 9:14</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_24_6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>.<p>This spiritual meaning of garden derives its cause from representations in the spiritual world, for there gardens appear where angels are in intelligence and wisdom. The intelligence and wisdom which they receive from the Lord cause such things to appear round about them; and this takes place from correspondence, for all things which exist in the spiritual world are correspondences. </p>
