799. 我也和其他人谈过, 既有这三人的同伴, 也有其追随者。 对于他们所有人, 我能得出结论, 凡那些生活仁爱, 尤其因为真理而热爱真理之人, 都愿意在灵界得到指教, 然后接受新教会的教义。 而另一方面, 那些紧抓虚假宗教不放, 且生活邪恶之人, 不愿接受教导, 这些人一步步远离新天堂, 将自己与地狱同类相连, 在此越来越反对敬拜主, 甚至到了不能听见耶稣名号的地步。 但天堂与之相反, 所有人一致承认主为天堂之神。 </p>

<p>
799. I have had conversations with many others as well - both with followers of these three and with various heretics. From visiting with all of them I was able to conclude that whoever among them had practiced a life of goodwill, and especially those who had loved the truth because it was true, were open to being instructed in the spiritual world and were receptive to the teachings of the new church.
<p>People who have become adamantly devoted to theological falsities, however, and also people who have lived evil lives, are not open to being instructed. Bit by bit, they distance themselves from the new heaven and come into association with people like themselves who are in hell. Once in hell, they become even more stubbornly and adamantly opposed to the worship of the Lord, even to the point where they cannot stand to hear the name Jesus. The complete opposite happens in heaven, where all are of one mind in acknowledging the Lord as the God of heaven. </p>

799. I spoke with many followers of those three leaders and also with many heretics. I was allowed to draw the conclusion that any of them who had led a life of charity, and more so those who had loved truth because it is true, allow themselves to be taught in the spiritual world, and accept the teachings of the new church. Those, however, who have convinced themselves of false religious beliefs, and those too who have led a wicked life, do not allow themselves to be taught, and these withdraw little by little from the new heaven, and associate with the people like themselves who are in hell. There they become more and more convinced in their firm opposition to the worship of the Lord, to such a point that they cannot bear to hear the name of Jesus. It is the reverse of this in heaven, where all with one accord acknowledge the Lord as the God of heaven. </p>

799. I have also talked with many others, both with followers of these three men and with their opponents; and respecting all of them I was enabled to conclude that all such among them as have lived a life of charity, and still more those who have loved truth because it is truth, suffer themselves to be instructed in the spiritual world, and then accept the doctrines of the New Church; while on the other hand those who have confirmed themselves in falsities of religion, and also those who have lived an evil life, do not suffer themselves to be instructed; and that these turn away step by step from the new heaven, and associate themselves with their like who are in hell, where they confirm themselves more and more against the worship of the Lord, and set themselves against it even to such an extent that they cannot bear to hear the name Jesus. But it is the reverse in heaven, where all with one accord acknowledge the Lord as the God of heaven. </p>

799. I have conversed with many other spirits, with followers of these three leaders as well as with heretics. It has been granted me to conclude that such of them as have lived a life of charity, and especially those who have loved truth because it is truth, willingly undergo instruction in the spiritual world and receive the doctrines of the New Church. On the other hand, those who have confirmed themselves in the falsities of religion, and also those who have lived an evil life, refuse to be instructed. These gradually withdraw from the new heaven and associate with their like in hell, where they obstinately confirm themselves more and more against the worship of the Lord, till they cannot bear to hear the name of Jesus. The reverse is the case in heaven; for there all with one accord acknowledge the Lord as God of heaven. </p>

</h4>
<p>
799. Cum pluribus aliis tam Sectatoribus Trium illorum, quam cum Haereticis loquutus sum, et de omnibus concludere mihi datum est, quod quicunque ex illis Charitatis vitam egerunt, et plus qui amaverunt Verum quia est Verum, in Mundo spirituali se patiantur instrui, et acceptent Novae Ecclesiae Doctrinalia: at vero illi qui se confirmaverunt in falsis religionis, et quoque illi qui malam vitam egerunt, non patiantur se instrui, et quod hi pedetentim se removeant e Novo Coelo, et se consocient cum similibus, qui in Inferno sunt, ubi plus et plus contra Cultum Domini se confirmant et obstinant, et usque eo, ut non sustineant audire Nomen Jesu; at vicissim in Coelo, ubi omnes unanimiter Dominum pro Deo Coeli agnoscunt. </p>
