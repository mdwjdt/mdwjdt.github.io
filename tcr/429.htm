<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">有些仁爱的义务是公众的，有些是家庭的，有些则是私人的</h4><br />429.仁爱的善举和仁爱的义务之间的区别，如同出于自由选择所做的行为和强制行为之间的区别。然而，这里所说的仁爱的义务不是指王国或国家中的政府职责，诸如部长管理的职责，法官审判的职责等等，而是指每个人的义务，无论他从事什么职业。所以，它们出自不同的源头，从不同的意愿流出，以致仁爱之人出于仁爱履行这些义务，而没有仁爱之人则出于仁爱的缺乏履行它们。</p>

429. 與義相關的責任包括社會的,家庭的和個人的责任與義
<p>相關的慈善行為和與義相關的責任, 彼此各不相同:前者屬於那些按照個人自由選擇去做或不做的事情; 後者屬於那些必須要做的事情。然而, 此處所說的與義相關的責任並不意味著一個國家或社會中某項工作或職務的責任, 例如總理必須去管理, 法官不得不履行審判的責任等等。此處所說的責任是每個人無論什麼職業都當有的責任。因此, 它們有各自的起因, 由不同的意圖所導致; 以至於有義之人履行這些責任是出自於義, 無義之人履行這些責任則出自於無義。 </p>

429. There Are Obligations That Are Related to Goodwill. Some of Them Are Public; Some Relate to the Household; and Some Are Personal
<p>Acts of kindness related to goodwill and obligations related to goodwill are distinguished from each other thus: The former belong to those things that we may or may not do of our own free choice and the latter to those that we must of necessity do. Nevertheless the obligations related to goodwill mentioned here do not mean the obligations connected with our job in our country or republic, such as the obligation a minister has to minister and the obligation a judge has to judge, and so on. They mean the obligations we all have regardless of the jobs we do. These have a different origin and flow from a different intention. These obligations are done with goodwill by people who have goodwill; they are done without goodwill by people who have none. </p>

429. X. Some charitable duties are public, some domestic and some private.<p>There is a difference between charitable kindnesses and charitable duties, like that between acts undertaken by free choice and those done of necessity. Still, by charitable duties we do not here mean the duties attached to office in a kingdom or republic, such as that of ministers to administer, of judges to judge, and so on, but the duties of every individual whatever his occupation. They come therefore from a different origin and are the result of a different act of will, so that those who are charitable do them out of charity, and in the opposite case the uncharitable do them out of lack of charity. </p>

<p>
429. X. THERE ARE DUTIES OF CHARITY, SOME PUBLIC, SOME DOMESTIC, AND SOME PRIVATE. <p>The benefactions of charity and the duties of charity are distinct, like the things done from choice and the things done from compulsion. But by the duties of charity official duties in a kingdom or state are not meant, as the duties of a minister to minister, of a judge to judge, and so on, but the duties of everyone whatever his employment may be. Thus these duties are from a different origin, and flow forth from a different will, and are therefore done from charity by those who have charity, and on the other hand from no charity by those who have no charity. </p>

<p>
429. X. THERE ARE PUBLIC, DOMESTIC AND PRIVATE DUTIES OF CHARITY.<p>The benefactions of charity and the duties of charity are distinct from each other, like things done from free will and those done from necessity. By the duties of charity, however, we do not here mean the duties belonging to any offices in a kingdom or republic, as the administrative duties of a minister of state, the judicial duties of a judge, and so on; but by such duties we mean those which every one performs whatever his position. They are not dictated by his office, nor by an official will; and therefore they are performed from a principle of charity by those who are in charity; but on the other hand, from no such principle by those who are not in charity. </p>

429. Quod sint Debita Charitatis, quaedam Publica, quaedam Domestica, et quaedam Privata.<p>Charitatis Beneficia et Charitatis Debita inter se distincta sunt, sicut illa quae ex libero arbitrio fiunt, et illa quae ex necessitate: at usque per Debita Charitatis, hic non intelliguntur Debita functionum in Regno et Republica, sicut ministri ut ministret, judicis ut judicet, et sic porro, sed intelliguntur Debita cujusvis in quacunque functione est, quare sunt ex alia origine, et profluunt ex alia voluntate, et ideo fiunt ex Charitate ab illis qui in Charitate sunt, ac vicissim ex nulla Charitate ab illis qui in nulla sunt. </p>
