<p>
776. This Second Coming of the Lord Is Not Taking Place in Person but in the Word, Since the Word Is from Him and He Is the Word
<p>Many passages say that the Lord is coming in the clouds of heaven; see, for example, <a href="3927/matthew_17_5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">24:30</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_26_64.htm">26:64</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_62.htm">Mark 14:62</a>; <a href="3927/luke_9_34.htm">Luke 9:34-35</a>; <a href="3927/luke_21_27.htm">21:27</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_1_7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_14_14.htm">14:14</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>. Until now no one has known, however, what the clouds of heaven mean. People think the Lord is going to appear in person in the actual clouds in the sky.
<p>The clouds of heaven stand for the Word's literal meaning, and the glory and power with which the Lord is going to come (<a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>) stand for the Word's spiritual meaning. The reason this has escaped everyone's notice until now is that no one yet, even in a theoretical flight of fancy, has guessed that there is any spiritual meaning within the Word of the type it actually contains.
<p>Because the Lord has opened up the Word's spiritual meaning to me and has also allowed me to be with angels and spirits in their world as one of them, I have discovered that a cloud of heaven stands for the Word's earthly meaning, glory stands for the Word's spiritual meaning, and power stands for the power the Lord has through the Word.
<p>Readers can see from the following passages in the Word that a cloud of heaven has this meaning.
<p>No one is like the God of Jeshurun, who is riding a horse in heaven, and in magnificence on the clouds. (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>)
<p>Sing to God; praise his name. Celebrate the horse rider on the clouds. (<a href="3927/psalms_68_4.htm">Psalms 68:4</a>)
<p>Jehovah is riding a horse on a fast-moving cloud. (<a href="3927/isaiah_19_1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>)
</p>
<p>
[2] To ride a horse means to equip us with divine truths from the Word, since a horse means our understanding of the Word (see <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_298.htm">Revelation Unveiled 298</a>). Surely everyone can see that God does not literally ride a horse on the clouds. For another passage,
<p>God rode upon angel guardians and made the clouds of the heavens his tent. (<a href="3927/psalms_18_10.htm">Psalms 18:10-12</a>)
<p>Angel guardians, too, mean the Word (see <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_239.htm">Revelation Unveiled 239</a>, <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_672.htm">672</a>).
<p>Jehovah binds the waters in his clouds and spreads his cloud over his throne. (<a href="3927/job_26_8.htm">Job 26:8-9</a>)
<p>Give strength to Jehovah, strength upon the clouds. (<a href="3927/psalms_68_34.htm">Psalms 68:34</a>)
<p>Jehovah created a cloud by day over every dwelling place in Zion; he placed a cover over all glory. (<a href="3927/isaiah_4_5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>)
<p>The Word in its literal meaning was also represented by the cloud in which Jehovah came down onto Mount Sinai when he proclaimed the law. The commandments of the law that were proclaimed at that time were and are the primary principles of the Word.
</p>
<p>
[3] The following things I have witnessed can be added to lend further support. In the spiritual world there are clouds, just as there are in the physical world, although spiritual clouds have a different origin than physical clouds do. In the spiritual world there are sometimes shining clouds over the angelic heavens and dark clouds over the hells. The shining clouds over the angelic heavens symbolize a lack of clarity that the angels there are experiencing because of the Word's literal meaning. When those clouds are breaking up, they symbolize the fact that the angels are coming into goodwill as a result of the Word's spiritual meaning. The dark clouds over the hells symbolize that the Word is being falsified and desecrated there.
<p>The fact that clouds have these symbolic meanings in the spiritual world is the origin [of their meanings in the Word]. The light that emanates from the Lord as the sun of the spiritual world symbolizes divine truth. Therefore the Lord himself is called the Light (<a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">John 1:9</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">12:35</a>). As a result, the Word itself, which is kept in the sanctuaries of the church buildings in the spiritual world, appears surrounded with shining light. Clouds dim that light. </p>

776. VII. This, the Lord's second coming, is not in person, but in the Word, which is from Him and which He is.<p>We read in many passages that the Lord will come in the clouds of heaven <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
; e.g, <a href="3927/matthew_17_5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">24:30</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_26_64.htm">26:64</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_62.htm">Mark 14:62</a>; <a href="3927/luke_9_34.htm">Luke 9:34-35</a>; <a href="3927/luke_21_27.htm">21:27</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_1_7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_14_14.htm">14:14</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>. But no one up to the present has known what the clouds of heaven mean; they have thought that He would appear in them in person. It has so far been unknown that the clouds of heaven mean the Word in its literal sense, and that glory and power, with which He is to come at that time (<a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>), mean the spiritual sense of the Word. This is because no one has even guessed that there is a spiritual sense in the Word, as there is in essence in this example. Since the Lord has now revealed to me the spiritual sense of the Word, and has allowed me to associate with angels and spirits in their world, as if I were one of them, it has been disclosed that the cloud of heaven means the Word in its natural sense, glory the Word in its spiritual sense, and power means the Lord's strength through the Word. This meaning of the clouds of heaven can be seen from these passages in the Word:<p>There is none like the God of Jeshurun, riding on the heaven, and in magnificence upon the clouds, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26-27</a>.<p>Sing to God, praise His name, extol Him who rides upon the clouds, <a href="3927/psalms_68_4.htm">Psalms 68:4</a>.<p>Jehovah riding upon a light cloud, <a href="3927/isaiah_19_1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] To ride means to instruct in Divine truths from the Word, for a horse means the understanding of the Word (see Apocalypse Revealed 298). Anyone can see that God does not ride upon the clouds. Further:<p>God rode upon the cherubim, and made the clouds of the heavens His tent, <a href="3927/psalms_18_10.htm">Psalms 18:10-11</a>.<p>Cherubim also mean the Word (see Apocalypse Revealed 239, 672).<p>Jehovah binds the waters in His clouds, and stretches out His cloud over His throne, <a href="3927/job_26_8.htm">Job 26:8-9</a>.<p>Give strength to God <sup "fn10_2">2</sup>
, strength upon the clouds, <a href="3927/psalms_68_34.htm">Psalms 68:34</a>, Jehovah will create <sup "fn10_3">3</sup>
over every dwelling of Zion a cloud by day; for glory will be a covering over all, <a href="3927/isaiah_4_5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>.<p>The Word in its literal sense was also represented by the cloud in which Jehovah came down on Mount Sinai, when He proclaimed the Law. The provisions of the Law then proclaimed were the rudiments of the Word.</p>
<p>
[3] The following facts may be added in support. The spiritual world has clouds just as the natural world does, but they are of a different origin. In the spiritual world there are sometimes shining clouds over the heavens of the angels, but dark clouds over the hells. Shining clouds over the heavens of the angels betoken obscurity there resulting from the literal sense of the Word; but when those clouds are dispersed, it means that the spiritual sense has brought them its clarity <sup "fn10_4">4</sup>
. Dark clouds over the hells betoken the falsification and profanation of the Word. The reason clouds have such meanings in the spiritual world is because light, which is radiated from the Lord as the sun of that world, stands for Divine truth. This is why He is Himself called light (<a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">John 1:9</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">12:35</a>). This also is why the Word itself, which is stored in the sanctuaries of church-buildings there, is to be seen with a halo of shining light; when dimmed, this is due to clouds.<p>

776. VII. THIS SECOND COMING OF THE LORD IS NOT A COMING IN PERSON, BUT IN THE WORD, WHICH IS FROM HIM, AND IS HIMSELF. <p>It is written in many places that the Lord will come in the clouds of heaven (as in <a href="3927/matthew_17_5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">24:30</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_26_64.htm">26:64</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_62.htm">Mark 14:62</a>; <a href="3927/luke_9_34.htm">Luke 9:34, 35</a>; <a href="3927/luke_21_27.htm">21:27</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_1_7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_14_14.htm">14:14</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>). And as no one has hitherto known what is meant by "the clouds of heaven," it has been believed that the Lord would appear in them in Person. Heretofore it has not been known that "the clouds of heaven" mean the Word in the sense of the letter, and that the "glory and power" in which He is then to come (<a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>), mean the spiritual sense of the Word, because no one as yet has had the least conjecture that there is a spiritual sense in the Word, such as this sense is in itself. But as the Lord has now opened to me the spiritual sense of the Word, and has granted me to be associated with angels and spirits in their world as one of them, it is disclosed that "a cloud of heaven" means the Word in the natural sense, and "glory" the Word in the spiritual sense, and "power" the Lord's power through the Word. That such is the signification of "the clouds of heaven" may be seen from the following passages in the Word: <p>There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun who rideth in the heaven, and in magnificence upon the clouds (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26-27</a>). <p>Sing unto God, praise His name; extol Him that rideth upon the clouds (<a href="3927/psalms_68_4.htm">Psalms 68:4</a>). <p>Jehovah rideth upon a light cloud (<a href="3927/isaiah_19_1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] "To ride" signifies to instruct in Divine truths from the Word, for "a horse" signifies understanding of the Word (seeApocalypse Revealed,<a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_298.htm">298</a>). Who does not see that God does not ride upon the clouds? Again: <p>God rode upon cherubs. He made His pavilion thick clouds of the heavens (<a href="3927/psalms_18_10.htm">Psalms 18:10, 11</a>). <p>"Cherubs" also signify the Word (see Apocalypse Revealed, n. <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_239.htm">239</a>, <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_672.htm">672</a>). <p>Jehovah bindeth up the waters in His clouds; Him spreadeth His cloud over His throne (<a href="3927/job_26_8.htm">Job 26:8, 9</a>). <p>Give ye strength unto God; His strength is in the clouds (<a href="3927/psalms_68_34.htm">Psalms 68:34</a>). <p>Jehovah will create over every dwelling of Mount Zion a cloud by day; for over all the glory shall be a covering (<a href="3927/isaiah_4_5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>). <p>The Word in the sense of the letter was also represented by the cloud in which Jehovah descended upon Mount Sinai, when He promulgated the law; the principles of the law that were then promulgated were the first fruits of the Word.
</p>
<p>
[3] As further proof, the following may also be added: In the spiritual world as well as in the natural world there are clouds, but from a different origin. In the spiritual world there are sometimes bright clouds over the angelic heavens, but dusky cloud over the hells. The bright clouds over the angelic heaven signify obscurity there arising from the literal sense of the Word; but when these clouds are dispersed, it signifies that they are in the clear light of the Word from the spiritual sense; while the dusky clouds over the hells signify the falsification and profanation of the Word. This signification of "clouds" in the spiritual world has its origin in the fact that the light which there goes forth from the Lord as a sun, signifies Divine truth; for which reason He is called "the Light" (<a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">John 1:9</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">12:35</a>). And for the same reason the Word itself there which is kept in the sacred recesses of the temples, appears surrounded by a clear white light, and its obscurity is induced by clouds. </p>

It has, therefore, been disclosed to me that by the clouds of heaven is meant the Word in the natural sense, by glory the Word in the spiritual sense, and by power the influence of the Lord by means of the Word. That the clouds of heaven have this signification may be seen from the following passages in the Word:<p>"There is none like unto the God of Jeshuron, who rideth upon the heaven... and in His excellency on the clouds" (A.V., sky)" <a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>.<p>"Sing unto God, sing praises to His name: extol Him that rideth upon the clouds (A.V., heavens)" <a href="3927/psalms_68_4.htm">Psalms 68:4</a>.<p>"JEHOVAH rideth upon a swift cloud" <a href="3927/isaiah_19_1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] To ride signifies to instruct in Divine truths from the Word; for a horse signifies the understanding of the Word, as may be seen in <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_298.htm">The Apocalypse Revealed 298</a>. Who does not see that God does not ride upon the clouds? Again,<p>"God rode upon cherubs... He made... His pavilion the clouds of the skies" <a href="3927/psalms_18_10.htm">Psalms 18:10-11</a>.<p>Cherubs also signify the Word, as may be seen in <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_239.htm">The Apocalypse Revealed 239</a>, <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_672.htm">672</a>.<p>Jehovah "bindeth up the waters in His... clouds... and He spreadeth His cloud upon His throne" <a href="3927/job_26_8.htm">Job 26:8-9</a>.<p>"Ascribe ye strength unto Jehovah (A.V., God)... His strength is upon the clouds. <a href="3927/psalms_68_35.htm">Psalms 68:35</a>.<p>"JEHOVAH has created (A.V., will create) upon every dwelling place of... Zion... a cloud by day... for upon all the glory shall be a covering (A.V., defence)" <a href="3927/isaiah_4_5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>.<p>The Word in the sense of the Letter was also represented by the cloud in which Jehovah descended on Mount Sinai, when He delivered the Law, the precepts of the Law which were at that time delivered being the beginnings of the Word.</p>
<p>
[3] In confirmation of this, the following may be added. There are clouds in the spiritual world just as in the natural world, but their origin is different. In the spiritual world bright clouds sometimes appear above the angelic heavens, and dusky clouds over the hells. The bright clouds over the angelic heavens signify that some obscurity exists there arising from the literal sense of the Word; but the dispersal of these clouds signifies that the angels are in its charity from the spiritual sense. The dark clouds, however, over the hells signify the falsification and profanation of the Word. The origin of this signification of clouds in the spiritual world is that the light which proceeds from the Lord as the Sun there signifies Divine Truth; therefore, He Himself is called the Light, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">John 1:9</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">12:35</a>; and, therefore, also the Word itself, which is kept in the holy places in the temples there, appears surrounded by a bright light; while any obscurity in the Word is indicated by the appearance of clouds over it. </p>

776. Quod Secundus hic Adventus Domini non sit in Persona, sed quod sit in Verbo, quod est ab Ipso, et Ipse.<p>Legitur multis in locis, quod Dominus venturus sit in nubibus Coeli, ut <a href="3927/matthew_17_5.htm">Matthaeus 17:5</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">24:30</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_26_64.htm">26:64</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_62.htm">Marcus 14:62</a>, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>

Sed hactenus nemo novit, quid per Nubes Coeli intellectum est; crediderunt, quod in illis in Persona appariturus sit. Quod autem per Nubes Coeli intelligatur Verbum in Sensu literae, et per Gloriam et Virtutem, in quibus etiam tunc venturus, <a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthaeus 24:30</a>, intelligatur Sensus spiritualis Verbi, hactenus latuit, quia nemo huc usque ne quidem conjectura assequutus est, quod aliquis Sensus spiritualis, qualis hic in se est, in Verbo sit. Nunc quia a Domino mihi apertus est Sensus Verbi spiritualis, <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
et mihi datum est una cum Angelis et Spiritibus in Mundo eorum sicut unus ex illis esse, detectum est, quod per Nubem Coeli intelligatur Verbum in Sensu naturali, et per Gloriam Verbum in Sensu spirituali, et per Virtutem potentia Domini per Verbum. Quod nubes Coeli illud significet, videri potest ex his locis in Verbo, "Non sicut Deus Jeschurun, <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
equitans in Coelo, et in magnificentia super NUBIBUS, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_26.htm">Deuteronomius 33:26</a>. <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
Cantate Deo, laudate nomen Ipsius, extollite equitantem super NUBIBUS, <a href="3927/psalms_68_5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>. <sup "fn120_5">5</sup>
Jehovah equitans super NUBE LEVI," <a href="3927/isaiah_19_1.htm">Esaias 19:1</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] Equitare significat instruere in Divinis veris ex Verbo, Equus enim significat intellectum Verbi; videatur Apoc. Rev. <sup "fn120_6">6</sup>
n. 298; quis non videt, quod Deus non equitet super nubibus. Porro, Deus equitavit super Cherubis, et posuit tentorium suum NUBES COELORUM, <a href="3927/psalms_18_11.htm">Psalm 18:11-13</a>; <sup "fn120_7">7</sup>
Cherubi etiam significant Verbum, videatur APOCALYPSIS REVELATA, <a href="239.htm">239</a>, <a href="672.htm">672</a>. Jehovah ligat aquas in Nubibus suis, et expandit super solium NUBEM SUAM, <a href="3927/job_26_8.htm">Hiob 26:8-9</a>. Date robur Deo, <sup "fn120_8">8</sup>
robur super NUBIBUS, <a href="3927/psalms_68_35.htm">Psalm 68:35</a>. <sup "fn120_9">9</sup>

Jehovah super omne habitaculum Zionis NUBEM interdiu, nam super omne gloria obtegumentum, <a href="3927/isaiah_4_5.htm">Esaias 4:5</a>Verbum in Sensu literae etiam repraesentabatur per NUBEM, in qua descendit Jehovah super Montem Sinai, cum Legem promulgavit; illa Legis, quae tunc promulgata sunt, fuerunt primitiae Verbi.</p>
<p>
[3] Ad confirmationem etiam addenda sunt haec; in Mundo spirituali sunt Nubes aeque sicut in Mundo naturali, sed ex alia origine; in Mundo spirituali sunt Nubes lucidae quandoque supra Coelos Angelicos, at Nubes furvae super Inferna; Nubes lucidae super Coelos Angelicos, significant obscuritatem ibi ex Sensu literali Verbi, at cum dissipantur illae nubes, significant quod in Claritate <sup "fn120_11">11</sup>
ejus sint ex Sensu spirituali: at Nubes furvae super Inferna significant falsificationem et prophanationem Verbi. Quod Nubes in Mundo spirituali talia significent, est origo, quia Lux, quae procedit a Domino ut Sole ibi, significat Divinum Verum, quare Ipse vocatur Lux, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">Johannes 1:9</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">12:35</a>, inde est, quod Ipsum Verbum, quod in adytis templorum ibi reservatur, candida luce circumcinctum appareat; et obscuritas ejus inducitur per Nubes.<p>
