<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第199节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>199</b>.主在世间时藉着对应说话，也就是说，祂的话既是属世的，也是属灵的。这一点从祂的比喻就能看出来。其中每句话都具有属灵之义。以十个童女的比喻为例。祂说：<br />天国好比十个童女拿着灯，出去迎接新郎。其中有五个是聪明的，五个是愚拙的。愚拙的拿着灯，却没有带油。聪明的拿着灯，又预备油在器皿里。新郞迟延的时候，她们都打盹睡着了。半夜喊声说，看哪，新郎来了，快出去迎接他。然后，那些童女就都醒来收拾灯。愚拙的对聪明的说，请分点油给我们，因为我们的灯要灭了。聪明的回答说，恐怕不够你我用的，不如你们自己到卖油的那里去买吧。她们去买的时候，新郎到了。那预备好了的，同祂进去赴婚筵，门就关了。最后，其余的童女也来了，说，主啊，主啊，给我们开门。他却回答说，我实在告诉你们，我不认识你们。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.1.htm">马太福音25:1</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.12.htm">12</a>）<br />人若不知道圣言具有属灵之义，也不知道属灵之义的性质，就不会明白这些细节中的每一个具有属灵之义，因而是圣洁的。就属灵之义而言：“天国”表示天堂和教会；“新郎”表示主；“婚筵”表示主藉着爱之善和信之真而与天堂并教会的婚姻；“童女”表示那些组成教会的人；“十”表示全部；“五”表示部分；“灯”表示属于信的事物；“油”表示属于爱之善的事物；“睡”和“醒”表示人在世属世的生命和死后属灵的生命；“买”表示为自己获取；“到卖油的那里去买”表示死后从别人那里为自己获取爱之善；由于那时，爱之善再也无法获取，所以，尽管她们拿着灯和买来的油来到婚筵的门口，但新郎还是对她们说：“我不认识你们”；这是因为在世的生命结束后，人仍保持在世时的生活方式。由此清楚可知，主只通过对应说话，因为祂通过自己里面的神性说话，这神性是祂的。由于“童女”表示那些组成教会的人，故在圣言的先知书中，经上多次提及锡安、耶路撒冷、犹大和以色列的童女、女儿或女子。因为“油”表示爱之善，所以教会的一切圣物都用油来膏。其它比喻以及主所说的一切话也一样。因此，主说，祂的话就是灵，就是生命（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.63.htm">约翰福音6:63</a>）。</p>

199. 當主在世間時, 祂以對應的方式來說話。因此當祂以屬世方式說話時, 同時也是屬靈方式。可比祂所說的比喻中明顯看出, 其中每一詞語都有內在的屬靈意義。
<p>以十個童女的比喻為例。祂說:那時, 天上的國度好比十個童女, 拿著燈出去迎接新郎。其中五個是愚拙的, 五個是聰明的。愚拙的拿著燈, 卻不預備油。聰明的拿著燈, 又預備油在器皿裡。新郞遲延的時候, 她們都打盹睡著了。半夜有人聽喊著說:"新郎來了, 你們出來迎接祂。"那些童女就都醒來收拾燈。愚拙的對聰明的說:"請分點油給我們, 因為我們的燈要滅了。"聰明的回答說:"恐怕不夠你我用的, 不如你們自己到賣家那裡去買吧。"她們去買的時候, 新郎到了。那預備好了的, 同祂進去坐席, 門就關了。其餘的童女隨後也來了, 說:"主啊, 主啊, 給我們開門。"祂卻回答說:"我實在告訴你們, 我不認識你們"(<a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">馬太福音25:1-12</a>)。
<p>沒人不知道這段話的每個細節有其屬靈意義, 有某些神聖和神性的事情藏在這些屬靈的意義之中。
<p>在屬靈意義中, 天上的國度表示天國和教會。新郎表示主。婚禮表示主與天國和教會的結合(通過天國與教會所行的仁之善與所領受的信之理)。童女表示教會中的人。十表示所有, 五表示一部分。燈表示信。油表示對善的爱慕。睡與醒表示人在世上的生活,是屬世的; 死後的生活,是屬靈的。買表示為自己獲取。去賣家那裡買油表示死後從他人獲取對善的爱慕。由於死後再也無法獲取對善的热愛, 因此儘管她們拿著燈和買來的油來到筵席的門口, 新郎告訴她們:"我不認識你們。"這是因為人在世的生命結束後, 仍舊保持類似的生命樣式(生時如何, 死後如何)。
<p>清楚得知, 主完全以對應來說話, 因為祂憑著在祂裡面的神性說話(這神性是祂的)。
<p>童女表示教會之中的人。這就是為何在聖言的先知書中, 多次說到錫安的,耶路撒冷的,猶大的,以色列的童女,女兒或女子。油表示對善的爱慕, 難怪教會的聖事與聖物用油來膏。
<p>這樣的說話方式同樣適用於主的其它比喻以及主所說的其它話語。這就是為何主說, 祂的話是靈,是生命(<a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">約翰福音6:63</a>)。 </p>

199. The Lord spoke in correspondences when he was in the world. While he was talking in an earthly way, he was also talking in a spiritual way. This is clear from his parables. Every word of them has a spiritual meaning inside.
<p>Take, for example, the parable of the ten young women. He said,
<p>The kingdom of the heavens is like ten young women who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were prudent and five were foolish. When the foolish women took their lamps, they did not take any oil. The prudent women took oil in their lamps. When the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep. In the middle of the night there was a shout: "Behold, the bridegroom is coming! Go out to meet him. " At that, all the women woke up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish women said to the prudent ones, "Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are going out. " The prudent women replied, "There might not be enough for us all. Go instead to the sellers and buy yourselves some. " But as they were going away to buy some, the bridegroom arrived and the women who were prepared walked in with him to the wedding and the door was closed. Later the other women came along and said, "Lord, Lord, open up for us. " But he answered and said, "I tell you truly, I do not know you. " (<a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1-12</a>)
<p>The only people who see that in each of these details there is a spiritual meaning and therefore something holy and divine are those who have a general awareness of the existence and nature of spiritual meaning.
<p>In the spiritual meaning, the kingdom of the heavens means heaven and the church. The bridegroom means the Lord. The wedding means the Lord's marriage to heaven and the church through the good that love does and the truth that faith perceives. The young women mean people who are in the church. Ten means all. Five means a part. Lamps mean beliefs. Oil means loving what is good. Sleeping and awakening mean our life in the world, which is an earthly life, and our life after death, which is a spiritual life. Buying means acquiring for ourselves. Going to the sellers and buying oil means trying after we have died to acquire from others a love for what is good. Since we can no longer acquire a love for what is good after we die, therefore although they brought their lamps and the oil they had purchased to the door where the wedding was taking place, the bridegroom told them, "I do not know you. " The reason is that after our life in the world, the way we have lived in the world remains.
<p>This makes it clear that the Lord spoke entirely in correspondences because he spoke from the divine nature that was in him and was his.
<p>Young women mean people who are in the church. This is why the prophetic Word says the virgin or daughter of Zion, of Jerusalem, of Judah, of Israel so many times. Oil means love for what is good. This is why all the church's sacred objects were anointed with oil.
<p>This correspondent nature applies to all the other parables and all the other words that the Lord spoke. This is why the Lord says that his words are spirit and are life (<a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>). </p>

199. The Lord, when He was in the world, spoke by means of correspondences; so He spoke spiritually as well as naturally. This can be proved by His parables, the individual expressions of which contain a spiritual sense. Let us take as an example the parable of the ten virgins. He said:<p>The kingdom of the heavens is like ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were wise, but five were foolish. The foolish ones, when they took their lamps, failed to take oil, but the wise ones took oil in their lamps. But when the bridegroom was late, they all became drowsy and went to sleep. However, in the middle of the night a cry went up, Look, the bridegroom is coming, go out to meet him. Then all those virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. But the foolish ones said to the wise ones, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. The wise ones, however, replied and said, Perhaps there may not be enough for us and for you; go rather to the sellers and buy some for yourselves. While they were away buying it, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding; and the door was shut. At length the other virgins came too, and said, Lord, Lord, open the door to us. But he replied and said, In truth I tell you, I do not know you, <a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1-12</a>.<p>No one who does not know that there is a spiritual sense, and what sort of sense it is, can see that each of these details contains a spiritual sense, and therefore a Divine holiness. In the spiritual sense the kingdom of the heavens means heaven and the church, the bridegroom means the Lord, the wedding the Lord's marriage with heaven and the church by means of the good of love and the truth of faith. The virgins mean those who belong to the church, ten means all, five a part. The lamps mean things to do with faith, oil things to do with the good of love. Sleeping and waking mean a person's life in the world, which is natural, and his life after death, which is spiritual. Buying means acquiring, going to the sellers and buying oil means acquiring the good of love from others after death. Because it cannot then any longer be acquired, although they came with their lamps and the oil they had bought to the door where the wedding was, still the bridegroom told them, I do not know you. This is because after his life in the world a person remains such as his life in the world made him. It is plain from this that the Lord spoke purely in correspondences, and this was because He spoke from the Divine which was in Him and was His. It is because virgins stand for those who belong to the church that we find so often in the prophetic parts of the Word mention of the virgin and daughter of Zion, of Jerusalem, of Judah, or of Israel, and it was because oil stands for the good of love, that all the holy things of that church were anointed with oil. It is the same in the rest of the parables and in every expression which the Lord used; thus it is that the Lord says that His words are spirit and life (<a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>). </p>

199. That the Lord when in the world spoke by correspondences, that is, when He spoke naturally He also spoke spiritually, can be seen from His parables, in each word of which there is a spiritual meaning. Take for example the parable of the ten virgins. He said: <p>The kingdom of heaven is like ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were wise, but five were foolish. They that were foolish taking their lamps took no oil; but the wise took oil in their lamps. While the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept. But at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. But the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil for our lamps are going out. But the wise answered saying Peradventure, there will not be enough for us and you; go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. But while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and they that were ready went in with Him to the wedding, and the door was shut. Afterward came also the other virgins, saying Lord, Lord, open to us. But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not (<a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1-12</a>). <p>That in all these particulars there is a spiritual sense and therefore a Divine holiness, no one sees except he who knows that the Word has a spiritual sense and who knows what that sense is. In the spiritual sense "the kingdom of the heavens" means heaven and the church; "the bridegroom" means the Lord; "the wedding" means the marriage of the Lord with heaven and the church, through good of love and truth of faith; "the virgins" mean those who constitute the church; "ten" means all; "five" some portion; "lamps" things pertaining to faith; "oil" things pertaining to good of love; "to sleep" and "to arise" means man's life in the world which is natural, and his life after death which is spiritual; "to buy" means to procure for oneself; "going to those who sell and buying oil" means to procure for oneself good of love from others after death; and because good of love is then no longer to be procured, although they came to the door where the wedding feast was with their lamps and the oil they had bought, still the bridegroom said to them, "I know you not;" this is because man, after his life in the world, remains such as he had lived in the world. From all this it is clear that the Lord spoke solely by correspondences, and this because He spoke from the Divine that was in Him and was His. As "virgins" signify those who constitute the church, so the terms virgin and daughter of Zion, of Jerusalem, of Judah, and of Israel, are frequently used in the prophetic Word. And because "oil" signifies good of love, all the sacred things of the church were anointed with oil. It is the same with the other parables, and with all the words spoken by the Lord. This is why the Lord says that His words are spirit and are life (<a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>). </p>

199. The Lord, when in the world, spoke by correspondences, thus with a spiritual and at the same time a natural meaning, as may be seen from His parables, in every word of which there is a spiritual sense. Take for example the parable of the Ten Virgins. He said:<p>"The kingdom of the heavens is like (A.V., Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened) unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him. Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. But the wise answered, saying, (A.V., Not so;) lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came: and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage; and the door was shut. Afterwards came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But he answered and said; Verily I say unto you, I know you not" <a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1-12</a>.<p>That in every part of this parable there is a spiritual sense, and consequently a Divine holiness, none can see but those who know that there is a spiritual sense, and are acquainted with the nature of it. In the spiritual sense, by the kingdom of the heavens is meant heaven and the Church, by the bridegroom is meant the Lord, and by the wedding is meant the marriage of the Lord with heaven and the Church by means of the good of love and the truth of faith. By the virgins are meant those who belong to the Church; by ten are meant all, and by five a certain part; by lamps are meant the things of faith, and by oil the things of the good of love. By sleeping and waking are meant the natural life of man in the world, and his spiritual life after death. By buying is meant to procure for themselves; and by going to those that sell, and buying oil, is meant to procure for themselves the good of love from others, after death. Because this can no longer be acquired after death, therefore, although they came to the marriage door with their lamps and the oil they had purchased, still the bridegroom said to them, "I know you not." This is because man, after his life in the world is over, remains such as he had been in the world. From these things it is evident that the Lord spoke by pure correspondences, and this because He spoke from the Divine that was in Him and was His own. Because virgins signify those who belong to the Church, therefore in the Prophetical Word is there such frequent mention of virgin, and daughter of Zion, of Jerusalem, of Judah, and of Israel; and because oil signifies the good of love, therefore all the holy things of the Church were anointed with oil. The case is the same with the other parables, and with all the words spoken by the Lord. For this reason the Lord declares that His words are spirit and life, <a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>. </p>

199. Quod Dominus, cum in Mundo fuit, loquutus sit per Correspondentias, ita etiam spiritualiter cum naturaliter, constare potest a Parabolis Ipsius, quarum singulis verbis inest sensus spiritualis; exemplo sit Parabola de decem Virginibus: dixit, "Simile est Regnum Coelorum decem Virginibus, quae accipientes Lampades suas exiverunt in occursum Sponsi: quinque ex illis erant Prudentes, quinque vero Stultae: quae erant Stultae, accipientes Lampades suas non acceperunt oleum, Prudentes vero acceperunt oleum in lampadibus suis. Tardante vero Sponso, dormitarunt omnes et obdormierunt: media autem nocte clamor factus est, ecce Sponsus venit, exite in occursum Ejus; tunc expergefactae omnes Virgines istae, et adornabant Lampades suas, verum Stultae Prudentibus dicebant, date nobis de Oleo vestro, quia Lampades nostrae exstinguuntur: sed respondebant Prudentes, dicentes, ne forte sufficiat nobis et vobis; abite potius ad Vendentes, et emite vobis ipsis. At abeuntibus illis ad emendum, venit Sponsus, et paratae ingressae sunt cum Ipso ad nuptias; et ostium clausum est. Et tandem veniunt etiam reliquae Virgines, dicentes, Domine, Domine, aperi nobis; Ille vero respondens dixit, amen dico vobis, non novi vos," <a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthaeus 25:1-12</a>. Quod in singulis his sit Sensus spiritualis, et inde Sanctum Divinum, non videt, nisi qui novit quod Sensus spiritualis sit, et qualis ille. In Sensu spirituali per Regnum coelorum, intelligitur Coelum et Ecclesia; per Sponsum Dominus; per Nuptias Conjugium Domini cum illis per bonum amoris et verum fidei; per Virgines illi qui ab Ecclesia sunt; per Decem omnes; per Quinque aliqua pars; per Lampades illa quae fidei sunt; per Oleum illa quae boni amoris; per Dormire et Expergisci, vita hominis in Mundo quae naturalis, et vita ejus post mortem quae spiritualis; per Emere, comparare sibi; per ire ad Vendentes et Emere Oleum, comparare sibi bonum amoris ab aliis post mortem; et quia tunc non amplius comparatur, ideo tametsi cum lampadibus et empto Oleo ad ostium, ubi nuptiae erant, venerunt, usque illis dictum est a Sponso, non novi vos; causa est, quia homo post vitam in Mundo, manet qualis in Mundo vixerat. Ex his patet quod Dominus per meras Correspondentias loquutus sit, et hoc quia ex Divino, quod in Ipso et Ipsius erat. Quia Virgines significant illos qui ab Ecclesia sunt, ideo toties in Verbo Prophetico dicitur Virgo et Filia Sionis, Hierosolymae, Jehudae, Israelis: et quia Oleum significat bonum amoris, ideo omnia Sancta Ecclesiae oleo ungebantur. Simile est in reliquis Parabolis, et in omnibus verbis, quae Dominus loquutus est; inde est quod Dominus dicat, quod verba Ipsius spiritus et vita sint, <a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">Johannes 6:63</a>. </p>
