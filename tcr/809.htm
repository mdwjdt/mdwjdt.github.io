809. There are actually two great cities like London in the spiritual world. Most English people come into one or the other of them after they die. I have had the opportunity to see and walk around one of the two. The center of that city is where [the earthly] London has its meeting place for traders called "the Exchange. " That is where their governors live. Above that city center is the eastern quarter of the city; below it is the western quarter; on its right side is the southern quarter, and on its left is the northern quarter. In the eastern quarter live people who were more devoted than others to living a life of goodwill; there are magnificent mansions there. The wise live in the southern quarter; they have many splendid possessions. In the northern quarter live people who had a greater love than others for free speech and freedom of the press. In the western quarter live people who proclaim justification by faith alone. On the right-hand side of that district there is an entrance to the city and also an exit from it. Those who live evil lives are sent away through this exit. The ministers who live in the west and teach faith alone do not dare to come into the city by the main streets, so they use narrower lanes instead, because no one is allowed to live in the city except people whose faith includes goodwill. I have heard complaints about the preachers from the west, that they fashion their sermons with great skill and eloquence and bring in a concept of justification by faith that is foreign to their listeners in such a way that the listeners no longer know whether one is supposed to do what is good or not. The preachers proclaim that faith itself is intrinsically good, and they separate this from good actions related to goodwill, which they say is a type of good that is done just to earn merit and is not therefore acceptable to God. When the people who live in the eastern and southern quarters hear sermons like that, though, they leave the church building and those preachers are soon deprived of their priestly status. </p>

809. There are two large cities resembling London, to which most of the English come after death. The first of these I have been allowed to view and walk through. In the middle of the city, where in London is the meeting place of the merchants, is what they call the Exchange; that is where the rulers live. Above this centre is the east, below it the west, on the right side the south, on the left the north. In the eastern quarter live those who have been particularly distinguished by leading charitable lives; there are magnificent palaces there. In the southern quarter live the wise, amid much splendour. In the northern quarter live those who have above others loved freedom of speech and writing. In the western quarter live those who preach justification by faith alone. On the right in this quarter is the entrance to this city, and also the way out; those who live wicked lives are sent out by it. The priests in the west, who teach faith alone, do not dare to enter the city by the main streets, but only through the narrower lanes, since the only inhabitants who are tolerated in that city are those who believe in charity. I heard complaints about the preachers in the west, that they display such skill and eloquence in their elegant sermons, bringing in the dogma of justification by faith which is unknown to their hearers, that they do not know whether good is to be done or not. They preach about faith as intrinsically good, and separate it from the good of charity, which they call merit-seeking and thus is unacceptable to God. But when those who live in the eastern and southern quarters of the city hear such sermons, they leave the churches and afterwards the preachers are deprived of their priestly office. </p>

809. There are two large cities like London, to which most of the English go after death. I was permitted to see one of these and to walk through it. Where in London the merchants meet, which is called the Exchange, there in that city is the center where its governors reside. Above that center is the east, below it is the west; on the right is the south, and on the left the north. In the eastern quarter those dwell who have lived a life of charity in a greater degree than others; here are magnificent palaces. In the southern quarter the wise dwell, and among them there is much splendor. In the northern quarter those dwell who more than others have loved freedom of speech and the press. In the western quarter those dwell who deal in justification by faith alone. On the right in this latter quarter there is an entrance to the city and also an exit therefrom; and those who live wickedly are here put out of the city. The preachers who live in the western quarter and teach the doctrine of faith alone, do not dare to enter the city by the large streets, but only through the narrow alleys, because none but those who believe in charity are tolerated in the city proper. I have heard them complaining of the preachers from the west, that they composed their sermons with so much art and eloquence, secretly weaving into them the doctrine of justification by faith, that they did not know whether good ought to be done or not. They preach that faith inwardly is a good, and this good they distinguish from the good of charity, which they call good that claims a merit, and therefore not acceptable to God. But when those who dwell in the eastern and southern quarters of the city hear such sermons they leave the churches, and the preachers are afterward deprived of the priestly office. </p>

809. There are two great cities like London, which most of the English enter after death. I have been permitted to see the chief of the two, and also to walk through it. The centre of the city answers to that part of London where the merchants meet, called the Exchange, <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
and there the governors live. Above the centre is the east, below it is the west, on the right side is the south, and on the left is the north. In the eastern quarter live those who more than others have lived a life of charity, and here are magnificent palaces. In the southern quarter live the wise, who are surrounded with much splendor. In the northern quarter live those who more than the rest have loved the liberty of speaking and writing; and in the western quarter live those who extol the doctrine of justification by faith alone. In this quarter to the right is the entrance to this city, and also the way out; and those who live wickedly are sent out by it. The clergy who live in the west, and who teach the doctrine of justification by faith alone, dare not enter the city by the chief streets, but only through the narrow alleys; for none but those inhabitants who are in the faith of charity are tolerated in the city. I have heard complaints made of the preachers in the west that they compose their sermons with such art and eloquence, and introduce into them the strange doctrine of justification by faith, that their hearers do not know whether good ought to be done or not. They preach faith as being intrinsic good, and separate this from the good of charity, which they call merit-seeking, and so not acceptable to God. But when those who live in the eastern and southern quarters of the city hear such sermons, they walk out of the churches; and the preachers are afterwards deprived of their office.<p>

809. Sunt binae Urbes magnae similes Londino, in quos plerique Angli post mortem veniunt; priorem Urbem datum est videre, et quoque perambulare. Medium illius Urbis est, ubi in Londino est Conventus Mercatorum, qui vocatur Exchange; ibi habitant Moderatores; supra illud Medium est Oriens; infra illud est Occidens; a latere dextro est Meridies, a latere sinistro est Septentrio. In Plaga orientali habitant, qui vitam Charitatis prae reliquis egerunt; ibi sunt Palatia magnifica; in Plaga meridionali habitant Sapientes, apud quos plura splendida sunt; in Plaga septentrionali habitant, qui prae caeteris amaverunt libertatem loquendi et scribendi: in Plaga occidentali habitant, qui Justificationem per solam fidem venditant; ad dextrum ibi in hac Plaga, est introitus in hanc Urbem, et quoque est exitus ab illa; illi, qui male vivunt, emittuntur ibi: Presbyteri qui in Occidente sunt, et solam illam Fidem docent, non audent per plateas magnas, sed per vicos angustiores intrare Urbem, quoniam non alii habitatores in ipsa Urbe tolerantur, quam qui in Fide Charitatis sunt. Audivi conquestos de Praedicatoribus ab Occidente, quod sermones suos tali arte et eloquio concinnent, et ignotam illis Justificationem per fidem involvant, ut nesciant num bonum faciendum sit vel non; praedicant fidem ut bonum intrinsecum, et hoc separant a bono Charitatis, quod vocant meritorium, et sic non acceptum Deo. Sed cum illi, qui in Plaga Urbis Orientali et Meridionali habitant, tales sermones audiunt, exeunt Templis: et Praedicatores postea deprivantur sacerdotio. </p>
