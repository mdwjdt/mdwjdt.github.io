<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第291节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第一诫 在我面前不可有别的神</h4><br />291.这是第一诫的内容（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出20.3.htm">出埃及记20:3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.7.htm">申命记5:7</a>）。就属世之义，即字义而言，最直接的意思是：绝不可敬拜偶像。因为接下来就是：不可为自己雕刻偶像；也不可作什么形像仿佛上天、下地和地底下、水中的百物；不可跪拜那些像，也不可事奉它；因为我耶和华你的神是忌邪的神（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出20.4.htm">出埃及记20:4</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/出20.5.htm">5</a>）。此诫命最接近字义的意思是绝不可敬拜偶像，因为在此诫命颁发前后，直到主降世，亚洲绝大部分地区盛行偶像崇拜。其原因在于，主来之前的所有教会都是象征和代表性的；这些象征和代表具有这样的特点：神性事物以各种雕像和雕塑形式来展示。当这些东西所代表的含义丧失后，普通百姓开始将它们当作神明来敬拜。以色列民族在埃及时也是这样敬拜的，这一点从他们在旷野中敬拜取代耶和华的金牛犊明显可知。后来，他们并未完全杜绝这种敬拜，这一点从圣言的历史和预言部中的很多经文明显看出来。</p>

291. 第一誡 除了我以外, 你們不可以有別的上帝
<p>這些是第一誡的內容(<a href="3927/exodus_20_3.htm">出埃及記20:3</a>;<a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_7.htm">申命記5:7</a>)。就屬世之義,也就是文字之義而言, 最直接的意思是:我們不可敬拜偶像。因為接著這樣說:不可為自己雕刻偶像, 也不可作什麼形像仿佛上天,下地和地底下,水中的百物不可跪拜那些像, 也不可事奉它, 因為我耶和華你的上帝是忌邪的上帝(<a href="3927/exodus_20_4.htm">出埃及記20:4-5</a>)。
<p>此誡命的最直接的意思是不可敬拜偶像, 因為在此誡命頒發之前的時期, 以及頒發之後,直到主降世之前, 中東大多地區都奉行偶像崇拜。流行偶像崇拜事出有因, 因為在主來之前的所有教會都是代表和象徵, 設計各樣的形像和雕刻來表達所代表和象徵的神性特徵。當這些形像和雕刻所代表的含義喪失之後, 普通百姓開始敬拜這些形像和雕刻為神明。 </p>

291. The First Commandment
<p>There Is to Be No Other God before My Face
<p>These are the words of the first commandment (<a href="3927/exodus_20_3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_7.htm">Deuteronomy 5:7</a>). In their earthly meaning, which is their literal meaning, the most accessible sense is that we must not worship idols; for it goes on to say,
<p>You are not to make yourself a sculpture or any form that is in the heavens above or the earth below or in the waters under the earth. You are not to bow yourself down to them, and you are not to worship them, because I, Jehovah your God, am a jealous God. (<a href="3927/exodus_20_4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>)
<p>The most accessible meaning of this commandment is that we must not worship idols, because before the time [when this commandment was given] and after it right up to the coming of the Lord much of the Middle East had idolatrous worship. What caused the idolatrous worship was that all the churches before the Lord came were symbolic and emblematic. Their symbols and emblems were designed to present divine attributes in different forms and sculpted shapes. When the meanings of these forms were lost, common people began worshiping the forms as gods.
<p>The Israelite nation had this kind of worship in Egypt, as you can see from the golden calf that they worshiped in the wilderness instead of worshiping Jehovah. That type of worship never became foreign to them, as you can see from many passages in both the historical and the prophetical parts of the Word. </p>

291. THE FIRST COMMANDMENT<p>There is not to any other God before my face.<p>These are the words of the first commandment (<a href="3927/exodus_20_3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_7.htm">Deuteronomy 5:7</a>). Their ordinary meaning in the natural or literal sense is that idols are not to be worshipped; for it continues:<p>You are not to make for yourself a carving or any likeness of anything in the heavens above and on the earth beneath, and in the waters under the earth. You are not to bow down before them or worship them, because I, Jehovah your God, am a jealous God, <a href="3927/exodus_20_4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>.<p>The reason why the ordinary meaning of this commandment is that idols are not to be worshipped, is that before this time and afterwards down to the Lord's coming, much of Asia practised idolatrous worship. The reason was that all the churches before the time of the Lord were representative and symbolic. The symbols and representations were such that ideas about God were presented in the form of various likenesses and carvings; and when their meanings became lost, the common people began to worship these as gods. Even the Israelite nation had this sort of worship when they were in Egypt, as is clear from the golden calf, which they worshipped in the desert instead of Jehovah. It is also clear that later on they were by no means averse to that sort of worship, as many passages in both the historical and prophetic books of the Word show. </p>

291. THE FIRST COMMANDMENT. <p>THERE SHALL BE [WITH THEE] NO OTHER GOD IN MY PRESENCE <p>These are the words of the first commandment (<a href="3927/exodus_20_3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_7.htm">Deuteronomy 5:7</a>). In the natural sense, which is the sense of the letter, the meaning nearest the letter is that idols must not be worshiped; for there follows, <p>Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any likeness that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters under the earth; thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them nor worship them; for I Jehovah thy God am a jealous God (<a href="3927/exodus_20_4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>). <p>In the sense nearest the letter this commandment means that idols must not be worshiped, for the reason that before this time and after it down to the Lord's coming, idolatrous worship prevailed in a great part of Asia. The cause of this worship was that all churches before the Lord's coming were representative and typical; and these types and representations were such, that Divine things were set forth under various figures and sculptured forms; and when the meanings of these were lost the common people began to worship them as gods. That the Israelitish nation was also in this worship when in Egypt, is evident from the golden calf which they worshiped in the desert instead of Jehovah; and that afterwards they were not wholly alienated from that worship is evident from many passages both in the historical and in the prophetic Word. </p>

291. THE FIRST COMMANDMENT<p>THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GOD (A.V., GODS) BEFORE ME.<p>These are the words of the first commandment. <a href="3927/exodus_20_3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>, and <a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_7.htm">Deuteronomy 5:7</a>. In the natural sense, which is the sense of the Letter, it first of all means that idols ought not to be worshiped; for there follow the words:<p>"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in the heavens (A.V., heaven) above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters (A.V., water) under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I JEHOVAH thy God am a jealous God" <a href="3927/exodus_20_3.htm">Exodus 20:3-6</a>.<p>This commandment first of all means that idols ought not to be worshiped, because before that time, and after it until the Lord's Coming, idolatrous worship was prevalent in a great part of Asia. The reason for this form of worship was that all the Churches before the Lord's Coming were representative and typical; and types and representations were such that Divine things were exhibited under various figures and sculptures; and these, when their signification was lost, the common people began to worship as gods. Such worship was observed among the Israelitish nation when in Egypt, as may be evident from the golden calf, which they worshiped in the wilderness instead of Jehovah. Moreover it is clear from many passages, both in the historical and in the prophetical Word, that they never abandoned that worship. </p>

291. PRIMUM PRAECEPTUM.<p>Non erit Deus alius coram faciebus meis.<p>Haec sunt verba Primi Praecepti, <a href="3927/exodus_20_3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_7.htm">Deuteronomius 5:7</a> per quae in SENSU NATURALI, qui est Sensus literae, proxime intelligitur, quod non colenda sint Idola, nam sequitur, Non facies tibi Sculptile aut ullam Figuram, quae in Coelis desuper, et quae in Terra infra, et quae in Aquis sub terra: non incurvabis te illis, et non coles illa, quia EGO JEHOVAH DEUS TUUS, DEUS ZELOTES, <a href="3927/exodus_20_4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Quod per hoc Praeceptum proxime intelligatur, quod non colenda sint Idola, erat causa, quia ante hoc tempus, et post illud usque ad Adventum Domini, in multo Orbe Asiatico fuit Cultus idololatricus; causa illius cultus fuit, quod omnes Ecclesiae ante Dominum fuerint repraesentativae et typicae, ac typi et repraesentationes erant tales, ut Divina sisterentur sub variis Figuris et Sculpturis, quas Vulgus, dum significationes illarum obliteratae sunt, inceperunt colere pro diis. Quod Gens Israelitica etiam in tali cultu fuerit, quando in Aegypto, constare potest ex Vitulo Aureo, quem loco Jehovae colebant in deserto; et quod postea ab illo Cultu non abalienati fuerint, constat ex multis locis in Verbo tam Historico quam Prophetico.<p>
