<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>179</b>.（7）这就是主在但以理书、福音书和启示录中所预言“那行毁坏可憎的和从没有过这样的灾难”的源头。我们在但以理书读到：<br />在飞鸟上必是个可憎者、荒凉者，直到所定的结局，它必倾在那行毁坏的身上。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.27.htm">但以理书9:27</a>）<br />在马太福音，主说：<br />到那时，有好些假先知起来，迷惑多人。你们看见先知但以理所说的“那行毁坏可憎的”站在圣地，读这经的人要留意。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.11.htm">马太福音24:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.15.htm">15</a>）<br />后来在同一章：<br />然后必有大灾难，从世界的起头直到如今，没有像这样的，将来也必没有。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.21.htm">马太福音24:21</a>）<br />启示录中有七章论述这大灾难和可憎的。它们就是以下经文所表示的：<br />当羔羊揭开封印时，从书卷中出来的黑马和灰马。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.5.htm">启示录6:5</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.8.htm">8</a>）<br />从无底坑里上来、与两个见证人争战并杀了他们的兽。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.7.htm">启示录11:7</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.10.htm">10</a>）<br />站在将要生产的妇人面前，等着吞吃她的孩子，并追她到旷野，在那里从口中吐出水来，像河一样要将她冲去的龙。（启示录12章）<br />龙的两个兽，一个从海中上来，一个从地中上来。（启示录13章）<br />三个像青蛙，从龙口、兽口并假先知的口中出来的灵。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.13.htm">启示录16:13</a>）<br />还有：<br />在七位天使把盛神大怒和最后七灾的碗倒在地上、海里、泉源和江河里、日头上、兽的座位上、幼发拉底河上，最后倒在空中，又有大地震，自从地上有人以来，没有这样的地震。（启示录16章）<br />“地震”表教会的倾覆，是被虚假和对真理的歪曲倾覆的，这也是以下经文所表示的：<br />从世界的起头至今都没有的大灾难。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.21.htm">马太福音24:21</a>）<br />下面这些话也有类似的意思：<br />又有一位天使伸出镰刀，收取了地上的葡萄园，把它丢在神忿怒的大酒醡中；那酒醡被踹，就有血从那里流出来，高到马的嚼环，远有一千六百斯他丢。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.19.htm">启示录14:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.20.htm">20</a>）<br />“血”表歪曲的真理。除此之外，那七章里还有其它类似经文。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #179 </h4>
<p>
179. (7)這就是那行毀壞可憎的以及那前所未有,絕不再有的災難之起源, 主在『但以理書』,福音書和『啟示錄』已經預言。
<p>我們讀『但以理書』:那行毀壞可憎的如飛而來, 並傾倒在那使聖地荒涼者身上, 直到所定的結局(<a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">但以理書9:27</a>)
<p>在『馬太福音』, 主說:且有好些假先知起來, 迷惑多人。你們看見先知但以理所說的"那行毀壞可憎的"站在聖, 讀這些的人要留意(<a href="3927/matthew_24_11.htm">馬太福音24:11</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">15</a>)
<p>然後, 在同一章:然後必有大災難, 從世界的起頭直到如今, 沒有像這樣的, 將來也不會有(<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">馬太福音24:21</a>)。
<p>這個大災難和可憎者, 在『啟示錄』中有七章講到。以下內容所表示的就是這個意思:當主開印時, 從書卷中出來的黑馬和灰馬(<a href="3927/revelation_6_5.htm">啟示錄6:5-8</a>)。從坑裡上來的獸, 與兩個見證人爭戰, 並殺了他們(<a href="3927/revelation_11_7.htm">啟示錄11:7-10</a>)。站在想要生產的婦人旁邊, 想要吞吃生出的孩子, 並且把婦人追逐到曠野, 口中吐水像河那樣沖婦人(啟示錄 12章)。龍的兩個獸, 一個從海中上來, 一個從地裡上來(啟示錄 13章)。三個像青蛙的靈, 從龍口,獸口和假先知之口而出(<a href="3927/revelation_16_13.htm">啟示錄16:13</a>)。還有, 在七位天人倒出盛上帝震怒的七碗,就是最後的七災——倒在地,海,江河眾水,太陽,獸的座位,幼發拉底河, 最後倒在空中; 之後有大地震發生, 自從地上有人以來, 從未發生過(啟示錄 16章)。地震表示教會的傾覆與翻轉, 因偽謬及被歪曲的真理而導致的結果。從世界的開關至今都未發生的大災難, 也是此意(<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">馬太福音24:21</a>)。
<p>下面內容有類似的意思:那天人就把鐮刀扔在地上, 收取了地上的葡萄, 丟在上帝忿怒的大酒醡中; 那酒醡在城外被踹, 血從酒醡流出來, 高到馬的嚼環, 遠有一千六百斯塔德(一斯塔德約170釐米)(<a href="3927/revelation_14_19.htm">啟示錄14:19-20</a>)。這裡的血表示歪曲的真理。在那七章之中還有其它許多類似的例子。 </p>

179. 7. The result is the abomination of desolation and the affliction such as has never existed before and will never exist again, which the Lord foretold in Daniel, the Gospels, and the Book of Revelation. In Daniel we read the following words:
<p>In the end desolation [will fly in] on a bird of abominations; even to the close and the cutting down, it will drip steadily upon the devastation. (<a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>)
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord says these words:
<p>Then many false prophets will rise up and lead many astray. Therefore when you see that the abomination of desolation foretold by the prophet Daniel is standing in the holy place, let those who read note it well. (<a href="3927/matthew_24_11.htm">Matthew 24:11</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">15</a>)
<p>Later in the same chapter we read,
<p>Then there will be a great affliction such as has never existed since the world began until now and will never exist again. (<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>)
<p>This affliction and abomination are dealt with in seven chapters in the Book of Revelation. They are meant by the black horse and the pale horse that came out of the book whose seal the Lamb had opened (<a href="3927/revelation_6_5.htm">Revelation 6:5-8</a>). They are meant by the beast that came up from the abyss and made war on the two witnesses and killed them (<a href="3927/revelation_11_7.htm">Revelation 11:7-10</a>). They are meant by the dragon that stood by the woman who was about to give birth, that intended to devour her child, and that pursued her into the desert and cast water like a river out of its mouth to swallow her up (Revelation 12). Also by the beasts of the dragon, one from the sea and the other from the land (Revelation 13); and by the three spirits like frogs that came out of the mouth of the dragon, the mouth of the beast, and the mouth of the false prophet (<a href="3927/revelation_16_13.htm">Revelation 16:13</a>).
<p>In addition, the affliction and abomination are meant by these events: the seven angels poured out the bowls of God's anger that contained the seven last plagues, pouring them onto the earth, into the sea, into springs and rivers, onto the sun, onto the throne of the beast, into the river Euphrates, and finally into the air, and then a tremendous earthquake occurred unlike any that had happened since the creation of humankind (Revelation 16). An earthquake means the act of turning the church upside-down, which was caused by falsities and by falsified truths - this meaning parallels the meaning of the great affliction such as has never existed since the world began (<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>).
<p>The following words have a similar meaning:
<p>The angel sent a sickle to harvest the vineyard of the earth and throw it into the great winepress of God's anger. The winepress was trampled and blood went out; sixteen hundred stadia away it was as high as a horses bridle. (<a href="3927/revelation_14_19.htm">Revelation 14:19-20</a>)
<p>Blood means falsified truth. There are many other examples in those seven chapters. </p>

179. (vii) THIS IS THE SOURCE OF THE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION AND THE AFFLICTION SUCH AS HAS NEVER BEEN NOR SHALL BE, BOTH OF WHICH THE LORD PREDICTED IN DANIEL, THE GOSPELS AND REVELATION. We read in Daniel:<p>Finally upon the bird of abominations desolation, to the point of ending and cutting off, shall be poured drop by drop upon devastation, <a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>.<p>In Matthew's gospel the Lord says:<p>Then many false prophets shall arise and lead many astray. When therefore you see the abomination of desolation predicted by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place, let him who reads take due notice, <a href="3927/matthew_24_11.htm">Matthew 24:11</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">15</a>.<p>Later in the same chapter:<p>Then there shall be great affliction, such as never was from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will be, <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>.<p>This affliction and the abomination are dealt with in seven chapters of Revelation. These are what is meant by the black horse and the pale horse which came out of the book, when the Lamb opened its seals (<a href="3927/revelation_6_5.htm">Revelation 6:5-8</a>); and by the beast coming up out of the abyss, which made war on the two witnesses, and killed them (<a href="3927/revelation_11_7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>ff.); as by the dragon which stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, to devour her child, and pursued her into the desert, and there ejected water from its mouth like a river, to drown her (chapter 12); also by the beasts of the dragon, one from the sea, the other from the land (chapter 13); also by the three spirits like frogs, who came out of the mouth of the dragon and the mouth of the beast and the mouth of the false prophet (<a href="3927/revelation_16_13.htm">Revelation 16:13</a>); moreover by the fact that after the seven angels had poured out the bowls of the wrath of God, in which were the seven last plagues, upon the earth, the sea, the springs and streams, the sun, the throne of the beast, the Euphrates and finally the air, a great earthquake took place such as had never occurred since the creation of man (chapter 16). The earthquake means the overthrow of the church, the result of falsities and falsifications of truth, much as is meant by the great affliction such as never has been since the beginning of the world (<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>). The following passage has a similar meaning:<p>The angel put in his sickle and reaped the grape-harvest of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God; and the winepress was trodden, and blood came out up to the bridles of the horses at a distance of one thousand six hundred stades <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
. <a href="3927/revelation_14_19.htm">Revelation 14:19-20</a>.<p>Blood means falsified truth. There are many more such passages in those seven chapters.<p>

179. (7) This is the source of that "abomination of desolation, and that tribulation such as has not been nor ever shall be," which the Lord foretold in Daniel, and in the Gospels, and in the Apocalypse. In Daniel we read: <p>Upon the bird of abominations shall be desolation even until the consummation and decision, it shall drop upon the devastation (<a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">9:27</a>). <p>In the gospel of Matthew the Lord says: <p>Many false prophets shall arise and shall lead many astray. When, therefore, ye shall see the abomination of desolation predicted by Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place, let him that readeth note it well (24<a href="3927/matthew_24_11.htm">:11</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">15</a>); <p>and afterwards in the same chapter: <p>Then shall be great tribulation, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be (verse<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21</a>). <p>This tribulation and that abomination are treated of in seven chapters of the Apocalypse; they are what are meant: <p>By the black horse, and the pale horse going out of the book, the seal of which the Lamb opened (<a href="3927/revelation_6_5.htm">6:5-8</a>). <p>Also by: <p>The beast coming up out of the abyss which made war upon the two witnesses and killed them (<a href="3927/revelation_11_7.htm">11:7</a>). <p>Also by: <p>The dragon which stood before the woman about to be delivered, that he might devour her child, and which pursued her into the desert and there from his mouth cast out water as a river that he might drown her (<a href="3927/revelation_12_1.htm">12:1</a> <p>Also by: <p>The beasts of the dragon, one from the sea and the other from the earth (<a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">13:1</a> <p>Again: <p>By the three green spirits like frogs which went forth out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet (<a href="3927/revelation_16_13.htm">16:13</a>). <p>And finally by this: <p>That after the seven angels had poured out the bowls of the wrath of God, in which were the seven last plagues, into the earth, the sea, the fountains and rivers, upon the sun, upon the seat of the beast, upon the Euphrates, and at length into the air, there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men upon the earth (<a href="3927/revelation_16_1.htm">16:1</a> <p>The "earthquake" means the overturning of the church, which is done by falsities and falsifications of truth, and this is signified also by: <p>The great tribulation, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world (<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>). <p>The following words have a like meaning: <p>And the angel thrust in his sickle and gathered the vineyard of the earth, and cast it into the great wine-press of the anger of God; and the wine-press was trodden and there went out blood even unto the bridles of the horses for a thousand and six hundred furlongs (<a href="3927/revelation_14_19.htm">Revelation 14:19, 20</a>); <p>"blood" signifying truth falsified.
