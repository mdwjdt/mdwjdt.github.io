<p>
794. From eyewitness experience of many years now, I can pass on to you that, just as in the physical world, in the spiritual world there are landmasses, plains and valleys, mountains and hills, springs and streams; there are parks and gardens, woods and forests. There are cities there, with mansions and homes. There are also written documents and books; jobs and businesses; gold, silver, and precious stones.
<p>To put it briefly, that world contains every single thing that exists in the physical world, although in heaven those things are immensely more perfect. The main difference, though, is that everything that comes into view in the spiritual world, such as houses, gardens, food, and so on, is created in a moment by the Lord. The things in that world are created to correspond with what is inside the angels and spirits, namely, their feelings and thoughts. The [living] things that come into view in the physical world, on the other hand, come forth from some kind of seed and grow. </p>

794. As a result of what I have seen over so many years I can report as follows. The spiritual world contains countries just as the natural world does; there are plains and valleys there, mountains and hills, springs and rivers. There are parklands, gardens, woods and forests, There are cities containing palaces and houses. There is writing there and there are books. There are administrative offices and businesses. There is gold and silver, as well as precious stones. In short, every single thing to be found in the natural world exists there too, but those in heaven are immeasurably more perfect. But there is the difference that everything to be seen in the spiritual world is created instantly by the Lord, as for instance are the houses, parklands, food and so on. These are created to correspond to the interiors of angels and spirits, that is, to their affections and the thoughts that spring from them. Everything, however, which is to be seen in the natural world comes into being from seed and so develops. </p>

794. From what I have seen during so many years, I can relate the following: In the spiritual world there are lands just as in the natural world, and there are plains and valleys, mountains and hills, also springs and rivers; there are parks, gardens, groves, and forests; there are cities, with palaces and houses in them; there are writings and books; there are occupations and business; there are gold, silver, and precious stones; in a word, there are all things and each thing there that are in the natural world; although the things in heaven are immeasurably more perfect. But there is this difference, that all things seen in the spiritual world are instantaneously created by the Lord, as the houses, parks, food, and the rest; and that they are created in correspondence with the interiors of angels and spirits, which are their affections and the thoughts therefrom; while all things seen in the natural world spring up and grow from seed. </p>

794. From what I have seen during so many years I can relate the following particulars. In the spiritual world, as in the natural world, there are lands, plains and valleys, mountains and hills, springs and rivers; there are paradises, gardens, groves and forests; there are cities, with palaces and houses in them; there are also writings and books; there are employments and trades; and there are gold, silver and precious stones. In a word, there are all things of whatever kind that exist in the natural world; but the things in heaven are immeasurably more perfect. The difference is that all things beheld in the spiritual world, as houses, gardens, food and the rest, are created in a moment by the Lord to correspond with the interior things of the angels and spirits, that is, with their affections and the thoughts arising from these; whereas all things beheld in the natural world derive their existence from seed and develop gradually. </p>

794. Ex visis per tot annos, possum sequentia referre, quod in Mundo spirituali sint aeque Terrae sicut in Mundo naturali, quodque sint Planities et Valles, tum Montes et Colles, et quoque Fontes et Fluvii; quod sint Paradisi, Horti, Luci et Sylvae; quod sint Urbes, et inibi Palatia et Domus; tum quod sint Scripturae et Libri; quodque sint Functiones et Negotiationes; et quod sint Aurum, Argentum et Lapides pretiosi; verbo, quod sint omnia et singula, quaecunque in Mundo naturali, sed illa in Coelo immensum perfectiora. Sed differentia est, quod omnia quae in Mundo spirituali spectantur, sint momento creata a Domino, sicut Domus, Paradisi, Cibi, et reliqua, et quod creentur ad correspondentiam cum interioribus Angelorum et Spirituum, quae sunt affectiones et inde cogitationes illorum; at quod omnia quae in Mundo naturali spectantur, ex semine existant et crescant. </p>
