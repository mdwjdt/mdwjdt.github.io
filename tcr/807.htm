807. 至于英吉利民族, 他们当中好一点的位于所有基督徒的中心, 因为他们享有内在智慧之光。 在尘世, 没人能看到这一点, 但在灵界, 它显而易见。 他们通过言论和新闻自由, 以及随之思考的自由获得这光。 对于没有这自由的其他人来说, 这光受到阻碍, 因为它没有出口。 然而, 这光凭自身并不活跃, 而要通过其他人才能活跃, 尤其通过有声望和权威之人。 他们一发话, 这光就变得明亮起来。 因为这个缘由, 在灵界, 英国人有被指定管理他们的统治者, 也有分配给他们的牧师, 这些牧师颇负盛名, 出类拔萃, 英国人出于其内在秉性会接受他们的判断。 </p>

807. As for the British, the better people among them are at the center of all Christians, because they have a profound intellectual light. This does not appear to anyone in the physical world, but it is blatantly obvious in the spiritual world. They owe this light to their freedom of speech and freedom of the press, and their consequent freedom of thought. (Among other peoples who do not have the same freedoms, that light is stifled because it does not have an outlet.) That light is not automatically activated in them, however; rather it is stimulated by others - particularly by people who are famous or powerful. As soon as they hear the latter make some statement, this light dawns in them. For this reason they are assigned governors in the spiritual world and are given preachers of great reputation and skill. Because of the native character they have, the British go along with the judgments of their governors and preachers. </p>

807. As regards the English nation, the better of them are at the centre of all the Christians, because they enjoy interior intellectual light. No one can see this in the natural world, but in the spiritual world it is plain to see. They get this light from the freedom they have to speak and write, and by this means to think. In the case of others who do not have the same freedom, that light is blocked, not having any outlet. The light, however, is not active of itself, but derives its activity from others, especially from men of reputation and authority. As soon as they utter any remark, the light grows bright. For this reason in the spiritual world the British have rulers set over them and are allotted priests who have famous names and outstanding minds; and their character makes them content with the judgments made by these distinguished people. </p>

807. As to the English nation, the better ones among them are at the center of all Christians, because they have an interior intellectual light; a light that is not manifest to anyone in the natural world, but it is clearly manifest in the spiritual world. This light they acquire from their freedom of speech and of the press, and consequent freedom of thought. With others, who have not such freedom, that light is suppressed because it has no outlet. It is true that such light is not active of itself, but it is rendered active by others, especially by men of repute and authority. As soon as anything is said by them, the light shines forth. For this reason governors are appointed over the English in the spiritual world, and priests are given them who are men of celebrity and of eminent ability, whose judgment they accept because of this inherent quality. </p>

<p>
807. As regards the English nation, the better sort among them are in the centre of all the Christians, because they have interior intellectual light. This light, although it is not apparent to any one in the natural world, is quite evident in the spiritual world. The English derive it from their liberty of speaking and writing, and thus of thinking. In others who do not enjoy such liberty, that light is obscured, because it has no outlet. That light, however, is not active of itself, but it is rendered so by others, especially by men of repute and authority; and when such men declare their opinions, that light shines out. For this reason the English in the spiritual world have governors appointed over them and priests of high reputation and great talent assigned to them, in whose decisions from their own native character they are led to acquiesce. </p>

</h4>
<p>
807. Quod ad Gentem Anglicam; meliores ex illis in Centro omnium Christianorum sunt, ex causa, quia illis Lux intellectualis interior est; haec non apparet alicui in Mundo naturali, sed apparet conspicue in Mundo spirituali; hanc lucem trahunt ex libertate loquendi et scribendi, et per id cogitandi: apud alios, qui in tali libertate non sunt, lux illa, quia non habet exitum, offunditur. Verum Lux illa non est activa ex se, sed fit activa ab aliis, imprimis a viris famae et auctoritatis; ut primum ab his aliquid dicitur, Lux illa exsplendescit. Propter hanc causam illis in Mundo spirituali praeficiuntur Moderatores, ac dantur Sacerdotes incluti fama, et praepollente ingenio, in quorum judiciis ex illa sua indole acquiescunt. </p>
