479. The Fact That Evil Is an Option Available to Everyone's Inner Self Makes It Obvious That We Have Free Choice in Spiritual Matters
<p>I will support the idea that we have free choice in spiritual things first by familiar arguments and then by particular arguments. People will recognize the validity of these arguments as soon as they hear them.
<p>The familiar arguments are these:
<p>1. The wisest of people, Adam and his wife, let themselves be seduced by a serpent.
<p>2. Their firstborn son Cain killed his brother Abel, and Jehovah God did not dissuade Cain by speaking with him but instead cursed him only after the fact.
<p>3. The Israelite nation in the wilderness worshiped a golden calf, even though Jehovah saw this from Mount Sinai and did not protect the people from doing so.
<p>4. David took a census of the people and because of it, a plague came upon them, which caused the death of many thousands, yet God did not act before but only after the fact, when he sent the prophet Gad to David and announced his punishment.
<p>5. Solomon was allowed to institute forms of worship that were idolatrous. Many kings after him were allowed to desecrate the Temple and the holy practices of the church.
<p>6. Later, that nation was allowed to crucify the Lord.
<p>7. Muhammad was allowed to establish a widespread religious movement, which did not conform to Sacred Scripture.
<p>8. Christianity has split into many sects, and each sect has split into heresies.
<p>9. In the Christian world there are many ungodly people and even people who boast about their godless actions. There are also plots and deceptions, even against godly, just, and honest people.
<p>10. Injustice sometimes triumphs over justice in law courts and business proceedings.
<p>11. The ungodly, too, are elevated to positions of honor and become leaders and heads of the church.
<p>12. Wars are allowed to happen, which involve the killing of many people and the plundering of cities, nations, and households, not to mention many other atrocities.
<p>Is it possible to attribute such things to anything but the free choice that exists in everyone? The concept of "permission" well known throughout this world is from no other source.
<p>On the point that the laws of permission are also the laws of divine providence, see Divine Providence (published in Amsterdam in 1764), <a href="swedenborg_divine-providence-dole_234.htm">Divine Providence 234-274</a>. The numbered points just above are explored there. </p>

479. IV. The fact that evil is permitted, a state enjoyed by everyone's internal man, makes it obvious that man has free will in spiritual matters.<p>The assertion that man has free will in spiritual matters must first be supported by general considerations, and after-wards by particular ones, such as anyone will acknowledge on first hearing. The general considerations are these. (1) Adam, the wisest of men, and his wife allowed themselves to be seduced by the serpent. (2) Their first son, Cain, killed his brother Abel, and Jehovah God did not deter them by talking to them, but only by cursing Cain after the event. (3) The Israelite nation in the desert worshipped the golden calf, although Jehovah saw this from Mount Sinai, and did not prevent it. (4) David counted the people and on account of this a plague was sent on them, of which so many thousands died; and it was not before but after this happened that God sent the prophet Gad to him and pronounced his punishment. (5) Solomon was permitted to set up idolatrous cults. (6) Many kings after him were permitted to profane the Temple and the holy things of the church; and finally that nation was permitted to crucify the Lord, (7) Mohammed was permitted to establish a religion which in many respects did not agree with Holy Scripture. (8) The Christian religion was divided into numerous sects, and each of these into heretical movements. (9) In Christendom there are so many ungodly people, and so much boasting about ungodly acts, as well as trickery and deceit, even practised on godly, just and honest people. (10) Injustice sometimes triumphs over justice in lawsuits and business dealings. (11) Even the ungodly are advanced to honours and become leaders in civil and religious life. (12) Wars are permitted, and then so many thousands are killed, and so many cities, nations and families have their goods looted, and suffer much besides. How can anyone explain such things except as the result of the free will enjoyed by every individual? In my book DIVINE PROVIDENCE (printed in Amsterdam in 1764, 234-274) it may be seen that the laws of permission too are laws of Divine providence; there too the facts mentioned above were explained. </p>

479. V. IT IS CLEARLY MANIFEST FROM THAT PERMISSION OF EVIL IN WHICH EVERYONE'S INTERNAL MAN IS THAT MAN HAS FREEDOM OF CHOICE IN SPIRITUAL THINGS. <p>That man has freedom of choice in spiritual things must first be confirmed by generals and afterward by particulars which everyone will acknowledge at first hearing. The generals are: (1) That the wisest of mankind, Adam and his wife, suffered themselves to be seduced by a serpent. (2) That their first son Cain slew his brother Abel, and Jehovah God did not hinder them by speaking to them, but only by a curse after the deed. (3) That the Israelitish nation worshiped a golden calf in the desert, and yet Jehovah saw this from Mount Sinai, and did not prevent it. (4) That David numbered the people, and a plague was therefore sent upon them, by which so many thousands of men perished; and that God, not before but after the deed, sent Gad the prophet to David, and denounced punishment upon him. (5) That Solomon was permitted to establish idolatrous forms of worship. (6) And many kings after him were permitted to profane the temple and the holy things of the church, and at length that nation was permitted to crucify the Lord. (7) That Mohammed was permitted to establish a religion in many respects not conformable to Sacred Scripture. (8) That the Christian religion is divided into many sects, and each into heresies. (9) That there are so many impious persons in Christendom, and even a glorying in impieties, as also machinations and wiles even against the pious, righteous, and sincere. (10) That injustice sometimes triumphs over justice in law and business. (11) That even impious persons are exalted to honors, and become leaders in church and state. (12) That wars are permitted, the slaughter of so many men, and the plundering of so many cities, nations, and families; and so on. Can anyone deduce such things from any other source than the possession of freedom of choice by every man? The permission of evil known throughout the world has no other origin. That the laws of permission are also laws of Divine Providence may be seen in the work on The Divine Providence (Amsterdam, 1764, n<a href="swedenborg_divine-providence-dole_234.htm">234-274</a>.234-274), where the foregoing examples are explained. </p>

479. IV. FROM THE PERMISSION TO DO EVIL, GRANTED TO THE INTERNAL MAN OF EVERY ONE, IT IS CLEARLY EVIDENT THAT MAN HAS FREE WILL IN SPIRITUAL THINGS.<p>That man has free will in spiritual things shall first be confirmed from considerations affecting men in general, and then from considerations affecting men individually, which every one will acknowledge as soon as he hears them. The general considerations <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-explained-whitehead_1.htm">Apocalypse Explained 1</a>, Adam the wisest of men, and his wife suffered themselves to be seduced by the serpent. 2, Their first-horn son, Cain, slew his brother Abel, and in both cases Jehovah God did not divert them from their evil course by speaking with them, but only by cursing them after the deeds. 3, The Israelitish nation in the desert worshiped a golden calf, while Jehovah, looking on from Mount Sinai, took no measures to prevent them. 4, David numbered the people, and a plague was, therefore, sent amongst them of which so many thousands perished; and God, not before but after the deed, sent the prophet Gad to him, and declared the penalty. 5, Solomon was permitted to establish idolatrous worship. 6, Many kings after him were permitted to profane the Temple and the holy things of the Church. 7, That nation was at length permitted to crucify the Lord; and Mohammed <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
was permitted to establish a religious system in many respects not in conformity with the Sacred Scripture. 8, The Christian religion is divided into many sects, and each of these is riven by heresies. 9, There are so many impious people in the Christian world and so much glorying in impiety; and also plots and stratagems contrived against the pious, the just and the upright. 10, Injustice prevails over justice in the law courts and in business. 11, The impious also are exalted to honors and become great men and leaders. 12, Wars are permitted, in which there is so much slaughter of men and ravaging of cities, nations and families; and so on. Is it possible to account for such things except from the fact that every man has free will? The permission of evil, which is recognized throughout the whole world, has no other origin. The laws of permission are laws of the Divine Providence, as may be seen in the work on Divine Providence printed at Amsterdam in the year 1764, 234-274, where an explanation will be found of the instances mentioned above.<p>

<a href="#fn9_1">1</a>.&nbsp;Mohammad, the founder of Mohammedanism or Islam, A.D. 571-632, was born at Mecca, where his father was spiritual and temporal head. He married a wealthy and devout widow, and owed much to her influence. In the visions to which he was subject he received confirmations of his Divine mission. He also received messages from Gabriel which were incorporated in the KORAN, the sacred book of Mohammedanism. Early persecution drove him from Mecca and in the year A.D. 622 he fled to Medina, where he was cordially welcomed. This flight, or Hejira, marks the beginning of the Mohammedan year, and from Medina he set out on his conquest of Arabia. Mohammedanism proclaims the unity of the God-head, and condemns idolatry; but the peaceful methods of propaganda soon gave place to ruthless persecution of infidels and merciless extermination of idolators. </p>
