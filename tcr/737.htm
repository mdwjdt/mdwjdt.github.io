<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>737</b>．这事过后，天人又回到基督教界智者聚会的大厅，召集那些确信天堂喜乐与永恒幸福就是乐园快乐的那些人，对他们说：“跟我来，我将带你们进入乐园，你们心目中的天堂，以使你们能开始享受你们永恒幸福的祝福。”他领他们穿过由名贵树种的枝条和嫩枝编织的高高走廊，进去后又领他们沿着迂回的小路从一个地方到另一个地方。实际上，这就是天堂最外围入口处的乐园，在世时以为整个天堂就是一个巨大的乐园，即所谓伊甸园的人就被带到这里。那些头脑中有固定观念的人也来到这里，这些人认为，人死后会摆脱劳作，彻底安息，这种安息无非是深深吸入灵魂的快乐，漫步在玫瑰丛中，享受最美味的葡萄汁，举行宴会，而这种生活唯有在天堂乐园才能找到。<br />在天人指引下，他们看见一大群人，有老人，也有年轻人，男孩，以及妇女和女孩。女人们正三五成群地坐在玫瑰花丛中编织花环，并将其戴在老年人的头上，套在年轻人的胳膊上，挂在男孩子的胸前。有的妇女从树上采摘水果，然后放到篮子里带给同伴；有的将葡萄、樱桃和桑葚压成汁，倒入杯中，尽情饮用；有的则呼吸着鲜花、水果、香叶散发的芳香；有的唱着令听众陶醉的动听歌曲；有的坐在喷泉边，将喷出来的泉水转变成各种形状；有的散步、聊天、说笑；有的进入花园避暑的小房子里，斜躺在沙发上，以及很多其它娱乐形式。<br />看到这些情景后，天人领着他的同伴沿着蜿蜒的小路左拐右拐，最后走到一组人跟前，他们正坐在一个最漂亮的玫瑰花园里，周围有橄榄树、橘子树和柠檬树。这些人坐在那里晃来晃去，双手抱着脑袋悲伤哭泣。天人的同伴向他们打招呼，问他们为何这样坐着。他们回答说：“自从我们来到这园子，已经七天了。刚进来的时候，我们的心似乎被提升至天堂，沉浸于其喜悦的至内极乐里。但三天后，那种极乐开始减弱，从我们心里消退，变得难以察觉，最后完全消失。当我们想象的喜乐就这样消逝后，我们害怕失去生活的全部乐趣，开始质疑是否存在永恒幸福这种事。此后，我们在各条小路和花圃之间徘徊，寻找进来的大门。我们到处兜圈子，碰见人就打听。有人说，不可能找到大门，因为这个天堂乐园就是一个巨大的迷宫，它的特点是，想要出去的人只会迷失得更深，还补充说：‘所以你们别无选择，不得不永远呆在这里；你们现正位于乐园的中央，它的所有快乐都集中在这里！’”他们继续对天人的同伴说：“我们在这里坐了一天半了，因为对找着出路已绝望，所以就在花园旁边坐下来。我们能看见周围大量的橄榄、葡萄、橘子和香橼，但我们越看，眼睛就越厌烦看，鼻子越厌烦闻，舌头越厌烦尝。这就是为什么你们看见我们现在难过、悲伤、哭泣。”<br />听完这番话，陪同这组人的天人对他们说：“这个乐园迷宫的确是天堂的入口。我认识路，会领你们出去。”一听这话，那些坐着的人一跃而起，拥抱天人，他们跟随他以及他的小组同行。在路上，天人教导他们什么是天堂喜乐和永恒幸福。他告诉他们，乐园里并不存在外在的快乐，除非这快乐伴随着内在快乐。“外在的乐园快乐，”他说，“仅仅是身体感官的快乐，而内在的乐园快乐是灵魂情感的快乐。除非外在快乐里有这些快乐，否则它们里面没有天堂的生命，因为其中没有灵魂。每种快乐，若没有它所对应的灵魂，都会逐渐消退，变得迟钝，并使精神疲乏，比劳作更甚。天堂处处有乐园，天人在其中找到巨大的喜悦，灵魂感受的快乐越多，他们感受的喜乐就越多。”<br />听到这里，他们都问：“什么是灵魂的快乐，它的源头在哪里？”天人回答说：“灵魂的快乐来自主的爱与智慧，因为爱是果效之因，它通过智慧产生果效，所以爱与智慧居于果效，果效就是用。主将快乐注入灵魂，这快乐通过心智的较高和较低区域降至所有身体感官，并在这里完满。喜乐由此变成喜乐，它通过‘永恒’（ the Eternal）成为永恒，喜乐就源于祂（ the Eternal）。你们已经看过乐园了，我向你们保证，那里的所有东西，哪怕一小片叶子，无不出自用里面爱与智慧的婚姻。所以，人若享有这婚姻，就在天堂乐园里，因而在天堂里。”</p>

<p>
737. After that, the angel went back to the house where the wise from the Christian world were gathered. He next summoned the group that had taken on the belief that heavenly joys and eternal happiness were delightful experiences in a garden paradise.
<p>The angel said to them, "Follow me, and I will bring you to paradise, to your heaven, so that you can begin having the blissful experiences of your eternal happiness. "
<p>He led them through a tall gateway made of interwoven shoots and branches from excellent species of trees. Beyond the entrance he led them along a meandering path from one area to another.
<p>This was in fact a garden paradise at the first point of entry to heaven. This is where people are sent who had believed when they were in the world that heaven consists entirely of one garden paradise, because it is called paradise. It is also used for people who had latched onto the idea that after death there is complete rest from labors, and that this rest takes the form of breathing in delightful experiences, walking among beds of roses, being cheered up by the finest of wines, and enjoying drinking parties; they think that this life is only possible in a heavenly garden paradise.
</p>
<p>
[2] The group that was led along by the angel then saw a huge crowd of people - both male and female, of all ages. They were in groups of three here, three there; ten here, ten there. Some groups were sitting among rose gardens, weaving garlands for the heads of the older people and the arms of the young, and braiding flower sashes to go around the children's chests. Other groups were making fruit juice, squeezing grapes, cherries, and berries into cups and enjoying sipping from them. Other groups were inhaling the air, which was redolent with the fragrances of flowers, fruits, and sweet-smelling leaves. Some groups were singing, caressing the ears of their listeners with beautiful songs. Some groups were sitting by fountains, making different patterns with the water that was squirting in the air. Other groups were going into gazebos to lie around on couches. They were all enjoying these and many other paradisal pastimes.
</p>
<p>
[3] After the angel's group had seen all this, he brought them along a path that wound here and there, until he finally stopped next to a group of people sitting in a gorgeous rose garden, bordered by olive trees, orange trees, and lemon trees. The people were rocking back and forth holding their heads in their hands, grief-stricken and weeping.
<p>The people in the angel's group greeted them and asked "What's wrong?"
<p>"It has been seven days now," they replied, "since we arrived in this paradise. When we first arrived, we felt as though our minds had been lifted into heaven itself and we had gained access to its inmost joys and pleasures. After three days, though, the fun began to wear off. These things became less and less pleasant to our minds; we eventually became numb to them and found no pleasure in them at all. When things we had thought would be such joys became no fun anymore, we started to fear that we were losing every delight of our life. We began to doubt there was even such a thing as eternal happiness. So then we began wandering along the pathways and through different areas, looking for that gateway through which we had come in. We walked around and around in great circles, and asked directions from the people we met. Some of them said, 'That gateway cannot be found. This garden paradise is a massive labyrinth. Those who try to leave go deeper and deeper into it. You have no choice but to stay here for eternity. You are in the heart of it now, the most central of all delights!'"
<p>The sufferers went on, "For the last day and a half we have been sitting here. Because we lost all hope of ever finding the way out, we stayed in this rose garden. We look around at all the olives, grapes, oranges, and lemons; but the more we look at them, the more tired we get of everything we can see with our eyes, smell with our noses, and taste with our tongues. So this is why you see us crushed with sorrow, grief-stricken, and crying. "
</p>
<p>
[4] The angel with the visiting group said to them, "This labyrinth of a garden paradise is actually just an entrance on the outskirts of heaven. I know the way out and I'll take you there. "
<p>At this the people sitting on the ground jumped up and gave the angel a hug. They joined the angel and his group. As they walked along, the angel taught them what heavenly joy and eternal happiness really are.
<p>"They are not in fact the external pleasures of paradise," he said, "unless the internal pleasures of paradise are felt at the same time. External pleasures of paradise are just things that delight our bodily senses. Internal pleasures of paradise are things that satisfy the desires of our soul. If these inner pleasures are not present within these outer pleasures, the outer pleasures have no heavenly life, because they have no soul. Every delight that is lacking its corresponding soul fades and wears out over time; eventually it fatigues the mind more than work does.
<p>"All throughout the heavens there are garden paradises, which are a source of great joy to the angels. The more of the soul's delight the angels have, the more truly joyful these joys become to them. "
</p>
<p>
[5] At that point they all asked, "What is the soul's delight and where does it come from?"
<p>"The soul's delight," the angel answered, "comes from love and wisdom from the Lord. Love is what produces this delight, and wisdom is how it produces it. Both love and wisdom find a home in the effect they have, and that effect is usefulness. This delight flows from the Lord into our soul and comes down through the higher and lower levels of our mind into all our bodily senses and finds its fulfillment in them. This is what makes a joy joyful and also makes it everlasting, because it comes from the eternal Source.
<p>"You have now seen the features of a heavenly garden paradise, and I tell you the truth: there is not a single thing there, not even the least little leaf, that does not come from the marriage of love and wisdom in usefulness. Therefore if we have that marriage within ourselves, then we are in a heavenly paradise, and therefore in heaven itself. " </p>

737. After this the angel returned to the building where the wise from the Christian world were meeting, and called to himself those who had adopted the belief that the joys of heaven and everlasting happiness were the delights of a garden. 'Follow me,' he said to them, 'and I shall take you to a garden, your idea of heaven, so that you can begin to enjoy the blessings of your everlasting happiness.' He took them through a lofty gateway made from branches and shoots of splendid trees woven together; and then once inside he took them round by a circuitous route from one quarter to another. It was in fact a garden at the outermost entrance to heaven, to which those are taken who in the world had believed that the whole of heaven was one big garden, called paradise. There also arrive those who had fixed in their minds the notion that after death there is total rest from labours, and that this rest consists simply of breathing deep draughts of delights, walking amid roses, enjoying the most delicate juices of grapes, and holding entertaining drinking-parties, such a life being only possible in a heavenly garden.</p>
<p>
[2] Under the angel's guidance they saw a huge throng of men, both old and young, of boys, of women and girls. There were groups upon groups of three or ten, sitting among the rose-beds weaving garlands to adorn the heads of the old men, the arms of the young men and to wrap around the chests of the boys. Other women were picking fruits from the trees and carrying them in baskets to their companions. <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
Others were pressing juice into goblets out of grapes, cherries and berries, and drinking it with pleasure. Others were sniffing the fragrance given off and spread around by flowers, fruits and aromatic foliage. Others were singing sweet songs to charm the ears of those present. Others were sitting by springs, and diverting the gushing water to make channels of various shapes. Others were walking about, conversing and joking together. Others were running, playing, dancing, in one place to make patterns, at another in rings.' Others were going into summer houses to lie down on couches; and there were many other garden delights.</p>
<p>
[3] When they had seen this, the angel led his companions through paths that curved hither and thither; and at last they came to a group who were sitting in a most beautiful rose-garden, surrounded by olive, orange and lemon trees. They were swaying to and fro, with their heads in their hands' grieving and weeping. The angel's companions addressed them and said: 'Why are you sitting like that?' 'It is seven days now,' they replied, 'since we came into this garden. When we came in, our minds seemed to soar to heaven and to be plunged into the inmost bliss of its joys. But after three days the bliss began to wear off, to fade from our minds, becoming impossible to feel and so nothing. When the joys we had imagined died away, we were afraid of losing all the pleasure in our lives; and we started to feel doubtful whether there was such a thing as everlasting happiness. After this we wandered through the paths and beds, looking for the gate by which we had come in. But we wandered round and round in circles, asking anyone we met. Some of these told us that the gate was not to be found, because this paradise of a garden is a vast maze, so arranged that anyone who wants to get out penetrates deeper into it. "So you have no option but to stay here for ever," they said. "You are in the middle of it, where all its delights are concentrated."'<p>The people they had encountered went on to tell the angel's companions: 'We have been sitting here now for a day and a half, and since we have lost all hope of finding the way out, we sat down by this rose-bed. We can see masses of olives, grapes, oranges and citrus-fruit around us, but the more we look at them, the more our eyes get tired of seeing them, our noses of smelling them, our tongues of tasting them. That is why you see us now sad, grieving and weeping.'</p>
<p>
[4] On hearing this the angel with the group said to them: 'This garden-maze is in fact an entrance into heaven. I know the way and will take you out.' When he said this, those who were sitting down sprang up and embraced the angel, and they followed him together with his group. On the way the angel taught them what heavenly joy and everlasting happiness are. He told them that there is no external delight in gardens unless this is accompanied by internal delight in gardens. The external delights of gardens are only delights of the bodily senses, but internal delights are delights of the affections of the soul. Unless these are within the external ones, there is no heavenly life, because there is no soul in them. Every delight without its corresponding soul becomes feeble and dull by continuance, and wearies the mind more than work. There are paradise-gardens everywhere in the heavens, and the angels find great joy in them, and the more delight of the soul there is in them, the more they feel those joys as joys.,</p>
<p>
[5] On hearing this they all asked: 'What is the delight of the soul, and where does it come from?' 'The delight of the soul,' the angel answered, 'comes from love and wisdom under the Lord's guidance. Since love is an effective agent and achieves its effect through wisdom, so both of these are located in the effect, and the effect is service. The Lord pours this delight into the soul, and it passes down through the higher and lower levels of the mind into all the bodily senses, where it reaches its fulfilment. That is what makes joy joy, and it becomes everlasting by the action of Him who is its everlasting source. You have seen the gardens, and I assure you, there is nothing in them, not even so much as a tiny leaf, which is not the product of the marriage of love and wisdom realised in service. So if anyone enjoys this, he is in the heavenly garden, and so in heaven.'<p>

737. After this the angel returned to the house where the wise from the Christian world had assembled, and called to him those who had persuaded themselves that the joys of heaven and eternal happiness were paradisal delights. <p>To them he said, "Follow me, and I will conduct you into paradise, your heaven, so that you may enter into the beatitudes of your eternal happiness." And he led them through a lofty gate formed by the interwoven branches and shoots of noble trees; and when they had passed through this he led them about by winding paths from one quarter to another. The place was actually a paradise which is at the first entrance to heaven, and into which are admitted those who had believed when in the world that all heaven is a paradise, because heaven is called paradise, and who had impressed upon themselves the idea that after death there is complete rest from labor, and that this rest is nothing else than breathing the very soul of delights, walking upon roses, being gladdened by the finest juice of the grape, and banqueting; and that this life is to be found only in a heavenly paradise.
</p>
<p>
[2] As they followed the angel they saw a great multitude of men both old and young, and of boys, women and girls, sitting in groups of three and groups of ten on flower-beds, weaving wreaths with which they decorated the heads of the old men and the arms of the young men, and bands of which they fastened across the breasts of the boys; others were pressing juice from grapes, cherries, and mulberries, into cups, and drinking it sociably; others were inhaling the fragrance exhaled and diffused from flowers, fruit, and odoriferous leaves; others were singing sweet songs which soothed the ears of the listeners; others sat at fountains, turning the water of the gushing streams into different shapes; some were walking about, talking and jesting; some entered into little garden-houses to recline on couches; and many other paradisal forms of pleasure they saw.
</p>
<p>
[3] When they had seen these things, the angel led his companions here and there through winding ways, and at last to some persons seated on a most beautiful flower-bed surrounded by orange, olive, and citron trees. These sat swaying themselves to and fro, wailing and weeping, their faces resting on their hands. The angel's companions addressed them asking why they sat thus. They answered, "It is now seven days since we came into this paradise. When we came in, our minds seemed to be exalted to heaven and to be admitted into the innermost satisfactions of its joys; but after three days those satisfactions began to diminish, to fade from our minds, to become imperceptible, and so to fail altogether. And when our imaginary joys had thus ceased, we feared the loss of all the delights of our life, and began to doubt whether there is any such thing as eternal happiness. After this we wandered through paths and plots in search of the gate by which we entered; but we simply walked about and about, making inquiries of those we met. Some of them said that the gate could not be found, because this paradisal garden is a vast labyrinth of such a nature that anyone wishing to go out only entered more deeply in, adding, 'Therefore you will have to remain here to eternity; you are now in the midst of the paradise where is the center of all its delights!'" To the companions of the angels they said further, "We have already been sitting here a day and a half; and as we are now hopeless of finding our way out, we sat down here on this flower-bed, and are looking about us at the abundance of olives, grapes, oranges, and citrons. But the more we look about the more does our sight become weary of seeing, our smell of smelling, and our taste of tasting. This is the cause of the sadness in which you find us and of our wailing and weeping."
</p>
<p>
[4] When they had heard this, the angel of the company said to them, "This paradisal labyrinth is really an entrance to heaven. I know the way out, and will lead you to it." At these words those who were seated arose and embraced the angel, and joining his company went with him. And the angel taught them on the way what heavenly joy and its eternal happiness are, that they are not external paradisal delights unless there is in them internal paradisal delights. "External paradisal delights," he said, "are delights of the bodily senses only, while internal paradisal delights are delights of the soul's affections; unless these are in the former there is no heavenly life in them, because there is no soul in them; and any delight apart from its correspondent soul gradually languishes, becomes torpid, and wearies the mind more than labor. There are paradisal gardens everywhere in heaven, and from them the angels derive their joys; and so far as the soul's delight is in them, so far those joys are joys to them."
</p>
<p>
[5] Hearing this they all asked, "What is the soul's delight, and what is its origin?" <p>The angel replied, "The soul's delight comes from love and wisdom from the Lord; and because love is the efficient, and becomes efficient by means of wisdom, so the abode of both is in the effect and the effect is use. This delight flows from the Lord into the soul, and descends through the higher and lower regions of the mind into all the bodily senses, and finds its fullness in them. Joy thereby becomes joy, and it becomes eternal from the Eternal in whom it originates. You have been viewing paradisal scenes, and I declare to you that there is not one thing there, not even a little leaf, that does not come from the marriage of love and wisdom in use. Therefore if man is in this marriage he is in a heavenly paradise, and thus in heaven." </p>

<p>
737. After this the angel returned to the house where the wise men from the Christian world were assembled, and summoned those who had entertained the belief that the joys of heaven and eternal happiness consisted in paradisaic delights. He said to them: "Follow me, and I will introduce you into paradise, your heaven, that you may enter upon the blessings of your eternal happiness." He led them through a lofty gateway, formed of the interwoven branches and twigs of noble trees. After they had entered, he led them about through winding paths from quarter to quarter. It was a real paradise at the first approaches to heaven; and into it are admitted those who, while in the world, had believed that all heaven was one paradise, because it is so called. They had entertained the idea that after death there would be complete rest from labor, supposing that this rest would be nothing else than experiencing the most exquisite delights, walking among rosebeds, being gladdened by the delicious juice of grapes, and participating in festivities; and that no other life would be possible in a heavenly, paradise.</p>
<p>
[2] Led by the angel, they saw a great number of old men, young men, and boys, as well as women and girls. They were sitting in groups of threes and tens upon beds of roses, wreathing garlands to deck the heads of the old men and the arms of the young men, and to twine as garlands round the breasts of the boys. Others were pressing the juice of grapes, cherries and mulberries into cups and drinking it with jovial glee. Others were breathing in the fragrance given out in all directions by flowers, fruits and sweet-smelling leaves. Others were singing sweet songs, with which they charmed the ears of those around. Others were sitting beside fountains, producing various effects as they diverted the leaping waters. Others were walking about enlivening their conversation with sallies of wit. Others were retiring to summer houses, to rest on the couches there; and there were many enjoying other delights in this paradise.</p>
<p>
[3] After they had seen these things, the angel led his companions along various winding paths till they came upon some persons seated in a most beautiful rose garden, which was surrounded by orange, olive and citron trees. They were swaying to and fro, holding their heads in their hands, lamenting and weeping. The companions of the angel addressed them, and said, "Why do you sit thus?" They replied: "It is now seven days since we came into this paradise. When we entered, our minds seemed raised to heaven and admitted into the fullest enjoyment of its delights; but after three days those joys began to grow dull, to fade from our minds and to lose their charm; and now they have gone completely. As our imaginary joys have passed away, there has come over us the fear of losing all that makes life enjoyable; and we have begun to doubt whether there is any such thing as eternal happiness. After a time we wandered through streets and open places in search of the gate by which we entered; but we only wandered round in circles. When we made inquiries of some persons we met, they said, 'The gate cannot be found; for this garden paradise is a vast labyrinth of such a nature that whoever wishes to go out, goes farther in; so you will require to remain here to eternity. You are now in the midst of the garden, where all delights are centered.'" They continued: "We have now been sitting here for a day and a half; and as we are without hope of finding our way out, we have seated ourselves in this rose garden, where we see around us olives, grapes, oranges, and citrons; but the more we look at them the more are our eyes wearied with seeing, our nostrils with smelling, and our palates with tasting. This is the cause of the sadness, grief and tears in which you see us."</p>

[4] On hearing this the attendant angel said to them: "This paradisaic labyrinth is really an entrance to heaven. I know the way out, and I will lead you forth." At these words those who were seated sprang to their feet and, embracing the angel, went with him together with his companions. On their way, the angel taught them what heavenly joy and eternal happiness arising from it really are. He explained that they do not consist in external paradisaic delights, unless these are accompanied by their corresponding internal delights. "For," said he, "external paradisaic delights are only those of the bodily senses, but those that are internal in character belong to the affections of the soul; and unless these are present in the external there is no spiritual life in them, because they are devoid of soul. For every delight, without its corresponding soul, continually grows more and more languid and dull, and wearies the mind more than labor. There are everywhere in the heavens paradisaic gardens; and these indeed are a source of joy to the angels, but this joy is real only in so far as the delight of the soul is present."</p>
<p>
[5] When they heard this they all inquired: "What is the soul's delight, and what is its source?" The angel replied: "The soul's delight is derived from love and wisdom proceeding from the Lord; and as love produces effects, and does so through wisdom, they both reside in the effect; and the effect is use. This delight flows into the soul from the Lord, descending through the higher and lower regions of the mind into all the bodily senses, and in them attains its fullness. From the presence of this delight joy becomes real joy, becoming also eternal from its Eternal Source. You have seen the things of paradise, and I declare to you that every thing there, down to the smallest leaf, exists from the union of love and wisdom in use. If, then, a man is in this union, he is in a heavenly paradise, and therefore is in heaven." </p>

737. Post haec Angelus rediit ad Domum conventus sapientum ex Christiano Orbe, et ad se vocavit illos, qui sibi induxerant fidem, quod gaudia Coeli et Felicitas aeterna essent delitiae Paradisiacae: his dixit, sequimini me, et introducam vos in Paradisum, Coelum vestrum, ut exordiamini beatitudines felicitatis aeternae vestrae; et introduxit illos per excelsam Portam, ex ramis et propaginibus nobilium arborum compaginatis exstructam: post introitum circumduxit illos per ambages a plaga in plagam; erat actualiter Paradisus in primo ingressu ad Coelum, in quem immittuntur illi, qui in Mundo crediderant quod universum Coelum sit unus Paradisus, quia vocatur Paradisus; ac qui impresserant sibi ideam, quod post mortem sit plenaria requies a laboribus, et quod requies haec non aliud esset, quam animas delitiarum trahere, super rosis ambulare, ex mustis delicatissimis uvarum laetificari, ac festiva repotia celebrare; et quod haec vita non detur nisi in Coelesti Paradiso.</p>
<p>
[2] Ducti ab Angelo videbant ingentem multitudinem tam senum quam juvenum, et puerorum, et quoque mulierum et puellarum; triades et triades, ac decades et decades, sedentes super Rosetis flectentes serta, quibus ornarent capita senum, brachia juvenum, ac fasciatim pectora puerorum; [alias legentes ex Arboribus fructus, et in calathis portantes ad sodalitia;] <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
alias exprimentes mustum ex uvis, cerasis et acinis in cyathos, et genialiter bibentes; alias attrahentes naribus fragrantias ex floribus, fructibus ac odoriferis foliis exhalatas ex circumsparsas; alias canentes dulces odas quibus mulciebant praesentium auditus; alias sedentes ad fontes, et aquas salientis venae derivantes in varias formas; alias ambulantes, confabulantes, et spargentes facetias; [alias currentes, ludentes, saltantes hic in numeros, et ibi in orbes;] <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
alias ingredientes domunculas hortulanas, ut super spondis cubarent; praeter plures alias laetitias paradisiacas.</p>

<p>
[3] Postquam haec visa sunt, duxit Angelus comites suos per circuitus huc illuc, ac ultimo ad sedentes in pulcherrimo Roseto circumcincto arboribus olivae, aurantii, et citri, qui nutantes tenebant manus sub genis, lugentes, et lachrymantes; hos alloquuti sunt comites Angeli, et dixerunt, cur ita sedetis; et responderunt, est nunc septimus dies a quo in hunc Paradisum venimus; cum intravimus, visa est mens nostra sicut elevata in Coelum, ac immissa in intimas ejus gaudiorum faustitates; sed post triduum coeperunt faustitates illae hebescere, et in mentibus nostris aboleri, ac fieri insensibiles, et sic nullae; et cum ita exspirata sunt imaginaria nostra gaudia, timebamus jacturam omnis jucunditatis vitae nostrae, et facti sumus ambigui de felicitate aeterna, num sit aliqua; et postea vagati sumus per vias et areas, quaesituri portam per quam intravimus; sed vagati sumus per gyros et gyros, ac interrogavimus obvios, ex quibus aliqui dixerunt, quod porta non inveniatur, quia Paradisiacus hic hortus est spatiosus Labyrinthus, qui talis est, ut qui vult exire, penitius intret; quare non potestis aliter quam hic manere in aeternum; vos estis in medio ejus, ubi omnes delitiae sunt in suo centro: et porro dixerunt ad comites Angeli, hic nunc per unum diem et dimidium sedimus, et quia absque spe inveniendi exitum sumus, reposuimus nos super Roseto hoc, et spectamus circum nos in copia olivas, uvas, aurantia et citros; sed quo plus illa spectamus, eo plus delassatur visus videndo, odoratus odorando, et gustus gustando; haec causa est maestitiae, luctus, et lachrymationis, <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
in quibus vos videtis nos.</p>
<p>
[4] His auditis, Angelus cohortis dixit illis, est hic Labyrinthus Paradisiacus vere introitus in Coelum; novi exitum, et educam vos; his dictis, sedentes surrexerunt, et amplexi Angelum, et una cum cohorte ejus comitati sunt illum; et Angelus in via docuit illos, quid Gaudium coeleste et inde Felicitas aeterna, quod non sint Delitiae paradisiacae externae, nisi simul cum illis sint Delitiae paradisiacae internae; delitiae paradisiacae externae sunt <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
modo delitiae sensuum corporis, at delitiae paradisiacae internae sunt delitiae affectionum animae; hae nisi in illis sint, non est vita coelestis, quia non est anima in illis: et omne delitium absque sua correspondente anima, ex continuo elanguescit <sup "fn120_5">5</sup>
et torpescit, et plus delassat animum quam labor. Sunt ubivis in Coelis Horti paradisiaci, et ex his etiam sunt gaudia Angelis, et quantum in illis est delitium animae, tantum sunt illa gaudia illis gaudia.</p>
<p>
[5] His auditis, quaesiverunt omnes, quid est delitium animae, et unde hoc; respondit Angelus, delitium animae est ex amore et sapientia a Domino, et quia amor est efficiens, et est efficiens per sapientiam, ideo est utriusque sedes in effectu, et effectus est usus: hoc delitium a Domino influit in animam, et descendit per superiora et inferiora mentis in omnes sensus corporis, et implet se in illis, inde gaudium fit gaudium, et fit aeternum ab Aeterno a Quo. Vidistis Paradisiaca, et assevero vobis, quod non aliquid ibi sit, ne quidem foliolum, quod non est ex conjugio amoris et sapientiae in usu, quare si homo in hoc est, est in Paradiso Coelesti, ita in Coelo.<p>
