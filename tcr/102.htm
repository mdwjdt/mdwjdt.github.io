<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>102</b>.基督教界目前的信仰是，就其人性而言，主不仅过去是玛利亚的儿子，现在仍是玛利亚的儿子。但这是一个谬论。祂过去的确是玛利亚的儿子，但现在不是。因为祂通过其救赎行为脱去了从母亲那里所得的人性，披上了来自父亲的人性。这就是为何主的人性是神性，并且在祂里面，神是人，人是神。祂脱去来自母亲的人性，并披上来自父亲的人性，也就是神性人。这一点从以下事实就能明显看出来，即祂自己从来不称呼玛利亚为祂的母亲，这从以下经文可以看出来：<br />耶稣的母亲对祂说，他们没有酒了。耶稣对她说，我与你有什么相干？妇人，我的时候还没有到。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.3.htm">约翰福音2:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.4.htm">4</a>）<br /><br />耶稣（从十字架上）见祂的母亲和祂所爱的那门徒站在旁边，就对祂母亲说，妇人，看，你的儿子。然后，祂对那门徒说，看，你的母亲。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.26.htm">约翰福音19:26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.27.htm">27</a>）<br />祂曾有一次不认她：<br />有人告诉耶稣说，你母亲和你弟兄站在外边，要与你说话。耶稣回答说，凡听从神的道并遵行的人就是我的母亲，我的弟兄。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.20.htm">路加福音8:20</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.46.htm">马太福音12:46</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.49.htm">49</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.31.htm">马可福音3:31</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.35.htm">35</a>）<br />所以，主称她为“妇人”，而非“母亲”，并把她交给约翰作母亲。在其它地方，她被称为祂的母亲，但主自己从不这样称呼。<br />以下事实也证明这一点，即祂不承认自己是大卫的子孙，因为我们在福音书中读到：<br />耶稣问法利赛人，说，论到基督，你们的意见如何？祂是谁的子孙？他们对祂说，是大卫的子孙。祂对他们说，那大卫怎么在灵里称祂为主，说，主对我主说，你坐在我的右边，等我使你的仇敌作你的脚凳？大卫既称祂为主，祂怎么又是他的子孙呢？”没有一个人能回答祂一言。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.41.htm">马太福音22:41</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.46.htm">46</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.35.htm">马可福音12:35</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.41.htm">路加福音20:41</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.44.htm">44</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗110.1.htm">诗篇110:1</a>）<br />我在此补充以下内容。有一次，我被允许与耶稣的母亲玛利亚对话。她碰巧经过，出现在我头顶上的天堂，身穿丝绸样的白衣。然后，她稍作停留说，她曾是主的母亲，主从她而生，但通过脱去从她得来的人身的一切事物而变成神，因此她拜主为她的神，并不想任何人视祂为她的儿子，因为神性的一切都在祂里面。真相从这几句话显露出来，即，因此耶和华在最初之物如在最末之物中那样是人，如经上所说的：<br />我是阿拉法和俄梅戛，是初和终，是昔在、今在、以后永在的全能者。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.8.htm">启示录1:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.22:13.htm">22:13</a>）<br />约翰一看见七灯台中间的人子，就仆倒在祂脚前，像死了一样。祂用右手按着他说，我是首先的和末后的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.13.htm">启示录1:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.6.htm">21:6</a>）<br />看哪，我必快来，要照各人所行的报应他。我是阿拉法和俄梅戛，是初和终，是首先的和末后的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.12.htm">启示录22:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.13.htm">13</a>）<br />还有以赛亚书：<br />耶和华以色列的君，以色列的救赎主，万军之耶和华如此说：我是首先的和末后的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.6.htm">以赛亚书44:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.12.htm">48:12</a>）</p>

<p>
102. 現今基督徒仍相信, 主的人身不僅曾是瑪利亞的兒子, 現在仍是她的兒子, 這就大錯特錯。祂曾是瑪利亞的兒子, 沒錯, 但並非仍是。因為藉著祂的救贖行動, 祂脫掉了由母親而來之人,穿上由父而來之人; 這就是為何主的人身是神性的。在祂, 上帝是人,人是上帝。祂脫去母親而來之人,穿上由父而來之人——就是神性之人, 由祂從未認瑪利亞為母親的事實也可證明。請看下列經文:耶穌的母親對祂說:"他們沒酒了。"耶穌對祂說:"我與你有甚麼相干呢？婦人, 我的時候還沒到"(<a href="3927/john_2_3.htm">約翰福音2:3-4</a>)。另處講到:耶穌見祂的母親和祂所愛的那門徒站在旁邊, 就對祂母親說:"婦人, 看你的兒子。"然後祂對那門徒說:"看你的母親"(<a href="3927/john_19_26.htm">約翰福音19:26-27</a>)。有一個場合, 祂沒有認她:"有人告訴耶穌說:'禰母親和禰弟兄站在外面, 要與禰說話。'耶穌回答:'誰是我的母親, 誰是我的弟兄？凡遵行上帝旨意的人就是我的母親, 我的弟兄。'"(<a href="3927/matthew_12_46.htm">馬太福音12:46-49</a>;<a href="3927/mark_3_31.htm">馬可福音3:31-35</a>)。主未曾稱她為"母親", 而是"婦人", 把她交給約翰作母親。其它一些章節中, 她被稱為祂的母親, 但並非主自己。
<p>[2]祂從未承認祂是大衛的子孫, 這個事實也可證明以上觀點。
<p>我們在福音書中讀到:耶穌問法利賽人:"論到基督, 你們的意見如何？祂是誰的子孫？"他們說:"是大衛的子孫。"祂對他們說:"那為什麼大衛在靈裡稱祂為主, 說:'主對我主說:禰坐在我的右邊, 直到我把禰的仇敵作禰的腳凳？'如果大衛稱祂為主, 怎麼又是他的子孫呢？"無人能回答一言(<a href="3927/matthew_22_41.htm">馬太福音22:41-46</a>;<a href="3927/mark_12_35.htm">馬可福音12:35</a>;<a href="3927/luke_20_41.htm">路加福音20:41-44</a>;<a href="3927/psalms_110_1.htm">詩篇110:1</a>)。
<p>[3]在此, 我要加上一些之前未知的資訊。一次, 我被允許與耶穌的母親瑪利亞對話。那次她出現在我的上方空中, 身穿絲質般的白色衣裳。她逗留一陣並說, 從祂由瑪利亞生出這層意義而言, 她曾是祂的母親。不過當祂將由她而來人性全然拋棄時, 祂就成為上帝了。因此她敬祂為上帝, 不想任何人視祂為她的兒子, 因為祂的一切都是神性。
<p>由以上的觀點, 另一個真理也隨之顯然:耶和華成為人, 既在首先之中, 亦在末後之中(首先的——耶和華, 末後的——人, 合一為主:上帝成為人,人成為上帝); 正如經上所言:"我是阿拉法和俄梅戛, 是始和終, 是那今在,昔在,將在, 全能者"(<a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">啟示錄1:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11</a>)。當約翰看見七個燈檯中的人子, 他僕倒在祂腳前, 像死了一樣。祂右手按在他身上, 說:"我是首先的和末後的"(<a href="3927/revelation_1_13.htm">啟示錄1:13</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a>)。"看哪, 我速速來臨, 照各人的行為報應他。我是阿拉法和俄梅戛, 是首先的和末後的, 是初和終"(<a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">啟示錄22:12-13</a>)。還有『以賽亞書』中:"耶和華以色列的君, 以色列救贖主萬軍之耶和華如此說:'我是首先的和末後的'"(<a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">以賽亞書44:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_48_12.htm">48:12</a>)。 </p>

<p>
102. There is a belief that the Lord in his human manifestation not only was but still is the Son of Mary. This is a blunder, though, on the part of the Christian world. It is true that he was the Son of Mary; it is not true that he still is. As the Lord carried out the acts of redemption, he put off the human nature from his mother and put on a human nature from his Father. This is how it came about that the Lord's human nature is divine and that in him God is human and a human is God. The fact that he put off the human nature from his mother and put on a divine nature from his father - a divine human nature - can be seen from his never referring to Mary as his mother, as the following passages show: "The mother of Jesus said to him, 'They have no wine. ' Jesus said to her, 'What do I have to do with you, woman? My hour has not yet come'" (<a href="3927/john_2_4.htm">John 2:4</a>). Elsewhere it says, "Jesus on the cross saw his mother and the disciple he loved standing next to her. He said to his mother, 'Woman, behold your son. ' Then he said to the disciple, 'Behold your mother'" (<a href="3927/john_19_26.htm">John 19:26-27</a>). On one occasion he did not acknowledge her: "There was a message for Jesus from people who said, 'Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, and they want to see you. ' Jesus said in reply, 'My mother and my brothers are these people who are hearing the Word of God and doing it'" (<a href="3927/luke_8_20.htm">Luke 8:20-21</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_12_46.htm">Matthew 12:46-49</a>; <a href="3927/mark_3_31.htm">Mark 3:31-35</a>). So the Lord called her "woman," not "mother," and gave her to John to be his mother. In other passages she is called his mother, but not by the Lord himself.
</p>
<p>
[2] Another piece of supporting evidence is that the Lord did not acknowledge himself to be the son of David. In the Gospels we read,
<p>Jesus asked the Pharisees, saying, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They say, "David's. " He said to them, "Why then does David in the spirit call him his Lord when he says, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a footstool for your feet?"' If David calls him Lord, how is he his son?" And no one could answer him a word. (<a href="3927/matthew_22_41.htm">Matthew 22:41-46</a>; <a href="3927/mark_12_35.htm">Mark 12:35-37</a>; <a href="3927/luke_20_41.htm">Luke 20:41-44</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_110_1.htm">Psalms 110:1</a>)
</p>
<p>
[3] Here I will add something previously unknown. On one occasion I was given an opportunity to talk to Mother Mary. She happened past, and I saw her in heaven over my head in white clothing apparently made of silk. Then, stopping for a while, she said that she had been the Lord's mother in the sense that he was born from her, but by the time he became God he had put off everything human that came from her. Therefore she adores him as her God and does not want anyone to see him as her son, because everything in him is divine.
<p>From the points above another truth now becomes manifest: Jehovah is as human in what is first as he is in what is last, as the following passages indicate: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the One who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty" (<a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11</a>). When John saw the Son of Humankind in the middle of seven lampstands, he fell at his feet as if dead; but the Son of Humankind laid his right hand on John and said, "I am the First and the Last" (<a href="3927/revelation_1_13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a>). "Behold, I am coming quickly to give to all according to their work. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last" (<a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12-13</a>). And in Isaiah, "Thus said Jehovah, the King of Israel and its Redeemer, Jehovah Sabaoth: I am the First and the Last" (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_48_12.htm">48:12</a>). </p>

<p>
102. The current belief of Christians is that the Lord as far as His Human is concerned not only was, but is, the Son of Mary, but this is a delusion. It is true that He was the Son of Mary, but not that He still is, since by His redeeming actions He put off the human He had from His mother and put on the Human from His Father. That is why the Lord's Human is Divine, and in Him God is man and man God. It can also be seen that He put off the human from His mother and put on the Human from his Father, that is, the Divine Human, by noticing that He never called Mary His mother, as is evident from the following passages:<p>Jesus' mother said to Him, They have no wine. Jesus said to her, What have I to do with you, woman? My hour has not yet come, <a href="3927/john_2_3.htm">John 2:3-4</a>.<p>and elsewhere:<p>Jesus from the cross saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing next to her. He says to His mother, Woman, behold your son; then He says to the disciple, Behold your mother, <a href="3927/john_19_26.htm">John 19:26-27</a>.<p>and on one occasion He did not acknowledge her:<p>People reported to Jesus, saying, Your mother and your brothers are standing outside and want to see you. In answer Jesus said, My mother and my brothers are those who hear the Word of God and do it, <a href="3927/luke_8_20.htm">Luke 8:20-21</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_12_46.htm">Matthew 12:46-50</a>; <a href="3927/mark_3_31.htm">Mark 3:31-35</a>.<p>So the Lord did not call her mother, but woman, and He gave her to be a mother to John. In other passages she is called His mother, but never by the Lord himself.</p>
<p>
[2] This is also proved by the fact that He did not acknowledge Himself to be the Son of David, for we read in the Gospels:<p>Jesus asked the Pharisees, saying, What is your opinion of the Christ? Whose son is he? They say to Him, David's. He said to them, How then does David call him in spirit his Lord, saying, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies the footstool for your feet? If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son? And no one could say a word in reply to Him, <a href="3927/matthew_22_41.htm">Matthew 22:41-46</a>; <a href="3927/mark_12_35.htm">Mark 12:35-37</a>; <a href="3927/luke_20_41.htm">Luke 20:41-44</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_110_1.htm">Psalms 110:1</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] Here I shall add something new.<p>I was once allowed to speak with Mary the mother of Jesus. She happened to be passing, and appeared in heaven above my head, dressed in white garments that looked like silk. Then she paused for a moment to say that she had been the Lord's mother, and He was born to her, but became God putting off everything human He had from her, and she therefore worships Him as her God, and she did not want anyone to acknowledge Him as her Son, because all the Divine is in Him.<p>The truth now shines out from these statements, that Jehovah is thus man in first things as in last, as it is written:<p>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, He who is, who was and who is to come, the Almighty, <a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11</a>.<p>John, on seeing the Son of Man in the midst of the seven lampstands, fell at His feet as if dead. But He laid His right hand upon him, saying, I am the first and the last, <a href="3927/revelation_1_13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a>.<p>Behold, I come quickly, to give to each according to his deeds. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last, <a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12-13</a>.<p>Also in Isaiah:<p>Thus spoke Jehovah, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, Jehovah Zebaoth, I am the first and the last, <a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_48_12.htm">48:12</a>. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #102 (Ager, 1970)

<p>
102. It is believed that the Lord as to His Human not only was, but still is, the son of Mary; but in this the Christian world is under a delusion. It is true that He was the son of Mary, but not true that He still is; for by the acts of redemption He put off the human from the mother and put on a Human from the Father; and this is why the Human of the Lord is Divine, and in Him God is Man, and Man is God. That He put off the human from the mother and put on a Human from the Father, which is the Divine Human, is shown by the fact that He Himself never called Mary His mother, as can be seen from the following passages: <p>The mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine. Jesus said unto her, Woman, what to Me and to thee? Mine hour is not yet come (<a href="3927/john_2_3.htm">John 2:3, 4</a>); <p>and again: <p>When Jesus saw [from the cross] His mother, and the disciple standing by whom He loved, He saith unto His mother, Woman, behold thy son. Then saith He to the disciple, Behold thy mother (<a href="3927/john_19_26.htm">John 19:26, 27</a>); <p>and on one occasion He did not acknowledge her: <p>It was told Jesus by some who said, Thy mother and Thy brethren stand without, desiring to see Thee. Jesus answering said, My mother and My brethren are these who hear the Word of God and do it (<a href="3927/luke_8_20.htm">Luke 8:20, 21</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_12_46.htm">Matthew 12:46-50</a>; <a href="3927/mark_3_31.htm">Mark 3:31-35</a>). <p>Thus the Lord did not call her mother but "woman," and gave her to John as a mother. In other places she is called His mother, but not by His own lips.
</p>
<p>
[2] This is further confirmed by the fact that He did not acknowledge Himself to be the son of David; for we read in the Gospels: <p>Jesus asked the Pharisees, saying, How does it seem to you about the Christ? Whose son is He? They say unto Him, David's. He said unto them, How then doth David in spirit call Him his Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I place Thine enemies as the footstool of Thy feet? If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son? And no man was able to answer Him a word (<a href="3927/matthew_22_41.htm">Matthew 12:41-46</a>; <a href="3927/mark_12_35.htm">Mark 12:35-37</a>; <a href="3927/luke_20_41.htm">Luke 20:41-44</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_110_1.htm">Psalms 110:1</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] To the above I will add this, which is new: Once it was granted me to speak with Mary the mother. On a certain occasion she passed by and appeared in heaven above my head in white raiment like silk; and then pausing a little she said that she had been the mother of the Lord, who was born of her; but that He, having become God, had put off everything human that He had derived from her, and that she therefore worshiped Him as her God, and was unwilling that anyone should acknowledge Him as her son, because in Him all is Divine. From all this there now shines forth this truth, that thus Jehovah is Man as in things first so also in things last according to these passages: <p>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, He who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty (<a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11</a>). <p>When John saw the Son of Man in the midst of the seven lamp stands he fell at His feet as dead; but He laid His right hand upon him saying, I am the First and the Last (<a href="3927/revelation_1_13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a>). <p>Behold I come quickly, to give every man according to his word I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last (<a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12, 13</a>). <p>and in Isaiah: <p>Thus said Jehovah, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, Jehovah of Hosts, I am the First and the Last (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">44:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_48_12.htm">48:12</a>). </p>

<p>
102. It is believed that the Lord as to His Human not only was, but also is, the Son of Mary; but in this the Christian world is mistaken. That He was the Son of Mary is true, but that He still is, is not true; for by the acts of redemption He put off the Human derived from the mother and put on the Human from the Father. Consequently the Human of the Lord is Divine, and in Him God is Man, and Man God. That He put off the Human from the mother, and put on the Human from the Father, which is the Divine Human, is evident from the fact that He never called Mary His mother. This may be seen from the following passages:<p>"The mother of Jesus saith unto Him, They have no wine. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come" <a href="3927/john_2_3.htm">John 2:3-4</a>;<p>and elsewhere;<p>"When Jesus saw" from the cross "His mother, and the disciple standing by whom He loved, He saith unto His mother, Woman, behold thy son! Then saith He to the disciple, Behold thy mother!" <a href="3927/john_19_26.htm">John 19:26-27</a>; and once He did not acknowledge her.<p>It was told Jesus "by certain, which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee. And He answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the Word of God, and do it" <a href="3927/luke_8_20.htm">Luke 8:20-21</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_12_46.htm">Matthew 12:46-50</a>; <a href="3927/mark_3_31.htm">Mark 3:31-35</a>.<p>Thus the Lord did not call her "mother," but "woman," and entrusted her to John as a mother; in other places she is called His mother, but not by Himself.</p>
<p>
[2] This is also proved by the fact that He did not acknowledge Himself to be the Son of David: for we read in the Evangelists:<p>that Jesus asked the Pharisees, "saying, What think ye of Christ? whose Son is He? They say unto Him, The Son of David. He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool? If David then call Him Lord, how is He his Son?

To the above I will add this account of an incident not hitherto recorded: <sup "fn9_2">2</sup>
<p>It was once granted me to speak with Mary, the mother. She was then passing by, and appeared in heaven over my head, clothed in white raiment like silk. Pausing for a little she said that she had been the mother of the Lord, for He was born of her; but that He, having become God, put off all the Human He had from her; and therefore that she now worships Him as her God, and is unwilling that any one should acknowledge Him as her Son, because the whole Divinity is in Him.<p>From what has been said this truth is now clear that Jehovah is Man in first things and in last, as the following passages declare:<p>"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending,... which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty" <a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11</a>.<p>When John saw the Son of Man in the midst of the seven candle-sticks, he fell at His feet as dead; and He laid His right hand upon him, saying, "I am the first and the last" <a href="3927/revelation_1_13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a>;<p>"Behold, I come quickly, to give every man according as his work shall be. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last" <a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12-13</a>.<p>Again in Isaiah it is written:<p>"Thus saith JEHOVAH the King of Israel, and His Redeemer JEHOVAH ZEBAOTH; I am the first, and I am the last" <a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_48_12.htm">48:12</a>.<p>

<p>
102. Creditur quod Dominus quoad Humanum non modo fuerit, sed etiam sit Filius Mariae, sed in hoc Orbis Christianus hallucinatur; quod fuerit Filius Mariae verum est, sed quod adhuc sit non verum est, nam per actus Redemptionis exuit Humanum ex Matre et induit Humanum ex Patre, inde est quod Humanum Domini sit Divinum, et quod in Ipso Deus sit Homo et Homo Deus. Quod exuerit Humanum ex matre, ac induerit Humanum ex Patre, quod est Divinum Humanum, videri potest ex eo, quod Ipse Mariam nusquam vocaverit suam matrem, ut constare potest ex his, Dixit mater Jesu ad Ipsum, vinum non habent, dixit illi Jesus, quid Mihi et tibi, MULIER, nondum venit hora mea, <a href="3927/john_2_3.htm">Johannes 2:3-4</a>. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Et alibi, Jesus e cruce videt Matrem, et Discipulum adstantem quem amabat; dicit Matri suae, MULIER ecce filius <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
tuus, deinde dicit Discipulo, ecce Mater tua, <a href="3927/john_19_26.htm">Johannes 19:26-27</a>: et semel quod non agnoverit illam, "Nuntiatum est Jesu a dicentibus, Mater tua et fratres tui foris stant, et volunt Te videre, Jesus respondens dixit, Mater mea, et fratres mei hi sunt, qui audiunt Verbum Dei et faciunt illud," <a href="3927/luke_8_20.htm">Luca 8:20-21</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_12_46.htm">Matthaeus 12:46-50</a>, <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
<a href="3927/mark_3_31.htm">Marcus 3:31-35</a>, ita Dominus non vocavit illam Matrem sed Mulierem, et dedit illam Johanni in Matrem; in aliis locis vocatur illa Mater Ipsius, sed non ab Ipsius ore.</p>
<p>
[2] Hoc etiam confirmatur per hoc, quod non agnoverit Se esse Filium Davidis; legitur enim apud Evangelistas, Interrogavit Jesus Pharisaeos, dicens, quid vobis videtur de Christo, cujus Filius est, dicunt Ipsi, Davidis; dixit illis, quomodo ergo David illum in spiritu Dominum suum vocat, dicens, dixit DOMINUS DOMINO MEO, sede a dextris meis, donec posuero inimicos tuos scabellum pedum tuorum; si ergo David vocat Ipsum Dominum, quomodo filius ejus est; et nemo poterat Ipsi respondere verbum, <a href="3927/matthew_22_39.htm">Matthaeus 22:39-44</a>, <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
<a href="3927/mark_12_35.htm">Marcus 12:35-37</a>; <a href="3927/luke_20_41.htm">Luca 20:41-44</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_110_1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] "His adjiciam hoc novum; semel mihi datum est loqui cum Maria Matre; praeteriit quondam, et visa est in Coelo supra caput meum in vestitu albo ut ex serico, et tunc paulum morata dixit, quod Mater Domini fuerit, quia a se natus, sed quod factus Deus exuerit omne Humanum ex illa, et quod ideo adoret Ipsum ut suum Deum, et quod nolit ut quisquam Ipsum pro Filio suo agnoscat, quia in Ipso omne Divinum est." Ex his nunc elucet haec veritas, quod ita Jehovah sit Homo ut in primis etiam in ultimis, secundum haec, Ego sum Alphah et Omegah, Principium et Finis; Ille qui Est, qui Fuit, et qui Venturus est, Omnipotens, <a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">Apocalypsis 1:8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11</a>. Johannes cum vidit Filium hominis in medio septem candelabrorum, cecidit ad pedes Ipsius sicut mortuus; sed imposuit dextram suam super illo, dicens, Ego sum Primus et Ultimus, <a href="3927/revelation_1_13.htm">Apocalypsis 1:13</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a>. Ecce venio cito, ut dem unicuique secundum opus ejus, Ego sum Alphah et Omegah, Principium et Finis, Primus et Ultimus, <a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Apocalypsis 22:12-13</a>. Et apud Esajam, "Sic dixit Jehovah Rex Israelis, et Redemptor ejus Jehovah Zebaoth, Ego sum Primus et Ultimus," <a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">44:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_48_12.htm">48:12</a>.<p>
