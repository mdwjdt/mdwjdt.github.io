<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>272</b>.我通过大量经验得知，人通过圣言与天堂交流。当我通读圣言，从以赛亚书第一章读到玛拉基书最后一章，以及大卫诗篇，同时将思维专注于属灵之义时，我被赋予一种清晰的觉知，即：每一节经文都与天堂某个社群相联，因而整本圣言与整个天堂相联。这一事实清楚表明，正如圣言就是主，圣言也是天堂，因为天堂通过主而成为天堂，主通过圣言而成为天堂全部中的全部。</p>

272. 眾多經歷讓我明白, 人通過聖言得以與天國交流。當我讀聖言時, 從『以賽亞書』第一章到『瑪拉基書』最後一章,還有大衛的『詩篇』, 將思想同時聚焦于屬靈意義, 我清楚地感知到每一節經文都與天國相應的社區相連接, 因而整本聖言與整個天國相連。由此事實可得出, 正如聖言是主, 聖言也是天國, 因為天國是源自主的天國, 主藉著聖言而成為全部天國的萬有。 </p>

272. An abundance of experience has taught me that human beings have a communication with heaven through the Word. When I read the Word through from the first chapter in Isaiah to the last chapter in Malachi and the Psalms of David, and I kept thinking about their spiritual meaning, I was given a clear perception that every verse communicates with some community in heaven, and therefore the whole Word communicates with the entirety of heaven. This made it clear to me that as the Lord is the Word, heaven is also the Word, since heaven is heaven from the Lord, and by means of the Word the Lord is everything to all heaven. </p>

272. By repeated experience I have been granted the knowledge that the Word is for man a means of communication with heaven. When I read through the Word, from the first chapter of Isaiah to the end of Malachi, and also the Psalms of David, keeping my thoughts fixed on the spiritual sense, I was granted a clear perception that each verse communicated with some community in heaven, and that thus the whole Word communicated with heaven as a whole. From this fact it became clear that just as the Word is the Lord, so too the Word is heaven, since heaven's being heaven comes from the Lord, and the Lord by means of the Word is the all in all of heaven. </p>

272. I have been permitted to learn through much experience, that man has communication with heaven through the Word. While reading the Word from the first chapter of Isaiah to the last of Malachi, and also the Psalms of David, and keeping my thought fixed upon the spiritual sense, a clear perception was given me that each verse communicated with some society of heaven, and thus the whole Word with the entire heaven; which showed clearly, that as the Lord is the Word, heaven is also the Word, since heaven is heaven from the Lord, and the Lord through the Word is the all in all things of heaven. </p>

272. It has been granted me to know from much experience, that man has communication with heaven by means of the Word. When I was reading through the Word from the first chapter of Isaiah to the last of Malachi, and the Psalms of David, keeping my thought fixed on the spiritual sense, it was granted me to perceive clearly that every verse communicated with some society in heaven, and that in this way the entire Word communicated with the whole of heaven. Thus it was evident that as the Lord is the Word, so also heaven is the Word, since heaven is heaven from the Lord, and the Lord by means of the Word is the All in all of heaven. </p>

272. Per multam experientiam mihi scire datum est, quod per Verbum sit homini communicatio cum Coelo: dum perlegi Verbum a Primo Capite Esajae usque ad Ultimum Malachiae, et Psalmos Davidis, et tenui cogitationem in Sensu spirituali illorum, datum est clare percipere, quod unusquisque Versus communicaret cum aliqua Societate Coeli, et quod sic totum Verbum cum Universo Coelo: ex quo patuit, quod sicut Dominus est Verbum, etiam Coelum sit Verbum, quoniam Coelum est Coelum a Domino, et Dominus per Verbum est omne in omnibus Coeli. </p>
