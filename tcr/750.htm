750. After the celebrations came to an end, the wedding guests left, including the ten newcomers with their angel guide. It was late evening, so they went home to bed.
<p>In the early light before dawn they heard a proclamation: "Today is the Sabbath!"
<p>They got up and asked the angel, "What does this mean?"
<p>"It is a day for worshiping God," he replied. "Days like this recur at regular intervals and are proclaimed by the priests. The worship service takes place in our churches and lasts about two hours. If you want, you can come with me and I'll take you there. "
<p>They got dressed and went with the angel. When they came into the church, they saw that it was a very large semicircle with a seating capacity of about three thousand. The seating took the form of extended, curved pews that followed the lines of the church. The pulpit in front of the pews was set back slightly from the focal point of the seating. There was a door behind the pulpit on the left.
<p>The ten newcomers came in with their angel guide. The angel directed them to the places where they should sit. "All who come into the church," he explained, "know their own place; they know it by a kind of instinct and cannot sit anywhere else. If they do sit elsewhere, they cannot hear or understand anything; in fact, they disrupt the proper arrangement within the congregation, and once that is disrupted, the priest's inspiration is lost. " </p>

750. After this merry party all the wedding guests left, and so did the ten men with the angel, for it was late in the evening, and they went to bed. At twilight they heard it being announced: 'Today is the Sabbath.' So they got up and asked the angel, 'What does that mean?' He replied that it was for Divine worship; this is repeated at fixed intervals and is announced by the priests. 'It is conducted,' he said, 'in our churches, and lasts about two hours. So if you like, you can come with me and I will take you in.'<p>So they dressed themselves and went with the angel and entered the church. It was, they saw, large enough to hold about three thousand; it was semi-circular, with pews or seats running in an unbroken arc to match the shape of the church. In front of these was a pulpit, a little back from the centre. The door was behind the pulpit on the left. The ten newcomers went in with their angel guide, who assigned places to them where they were to sit, telling them: 'Everyone who comes into the church knows his own place. He knows this intuitively, and he cannot sit anywhere else. If he does, he cannot hear or perceive anything, and he upsets the arrangement, and if this happens, the priest is not inspired.' </p>

750. After this social festivity all the wedding guests departed and also the ten men in company with their angel. It was late in the evening, and they went to bed. At dawn they heard it proclaimed, "Today is the Sabbath." They arose and asked the angel what it meant. He replied, "It is a summons to the worship of God which returns at stated times and is proclaimed by the priests; it is conducted in our temples, and continues about two hours; come with me, therefore, if you like, and I will introduce you." <p>They made themselves ready and accompanied the angel, and entered the temple. And behold, it was a large temple capable of seating about three thousand persons, semi-circular in form, with benches or seats extending entirely around, following the shape of the temple. The pulpit was in front of the seats, back a little from the center; the door was on the left behind the pulpit. <p>The ten visitors entered with their angel guide, and he assigned them their seat, saying, "Everyone who enters the temple knows his place, he knows it from something within; and he can sit nowhere else; if he sits elsewhere, he hears nothing and perceives nothing; and moreover he disturbs the order, and when the order is disturbed the priest is not inspired." </p>

750. After this social festivity, all those invited to the wedding departed, and also the ten strangers with their attendant angel; and the evening being far advanced, they retired to rest. At dawn they heard a proclamation: "To-day is the Sabbath." Then they arose and asked the angel what it meant. He replied: "It is a call to the worship of God which comes at stated intervals, and it is proclaimed by the priests. The worship is observed in our temples, and lasts about two hours. Come with me if you wish, and I will introduce you. So making themselves ready, they accompanied the angel and entered the temple. It was a large semicircular building, holding about three thousand persons; and the benches or seats were carried round in unbroken rows following the form of the temple. The pulpit faced the seats, and was placed a little back from the centre; and the door was on the left behind the pulpit. The ten strangers entered with the angel, who indicated to them the places where they were to sit, saying: "Every one who enters the temple knows his own place; he knows this from an innate perception, and he cannot sit anywhere else. If he does, he neither hears nor perceives anything; and, moreover, he disturbs the order; and when this is done, the priest is not inspired." </p>

750. Post hoc festivum Sodalitium <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
omnes invitati ad nuptias abiverunt, et quoque decem illi Viri cum suo Angelo, erat sera Vespera, et cubitum ibant. In diluculo audiverunt Proclamationem, HODIE SABBATHUM, et surrexerunt, et interrogaverunt Angelum, quid illud; respondit, quod sit ad Cultum Dei, qui statis temporibus redit, et a Sacerdotibus proclamatur; peragitur ille in Templis nostris, et perstat circiter binas horas; quare, si lubet, ite mecum, et introducam; et accinxerunt se, et comitati sunt Angelum, et intraverunt: et ecce Templum erat amplum, capax circiter trium millium, semirotundum, <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
scamna seu sedilia continua secundum figuram Templi in rotundum circumducta. Pulpitum ante illa paulo retractum a centro; janua post pulpitum a sinistro. Intraverunt decem Viri advenae cum Angelo ductore suo, et Angelus addixit illis loca ubi sederent, dicens illis, quisque qui intrat in Templum, scit suum locum; hoc scit ex insito, nec potest sedere alibi; si alibi, nihil audit et nihil percipit, et quoque turbat ordinem, a quo turbato Sacerdos non inspiratur.<p>
