618. Regeneration Is Not Possible without the Truths That Shape Faith and Are Joined with Goodwill
<p>We are regenerated by three things: the Lord, faith, and goodwill. These three would lie hidden like extremely valuable gems buried underground if divine truths from the Word did not open them to view. In fact, they do lie hidden for people who deny that we can cooperate with the Lord, even though such people read the Word a hundred or a thousand times and those things stand forth in clear light there.
<p>Take the Lord, for example. Do any who are convinced of the faith of today regard with open eyes the statements in the Word that the Lord and the Father are one, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that the will of the Father is that we believe in the Son, not to mention countless other similar teachings about the Lord that occur in both testaments? The reason for this is that they do not have truths, and are therefore not in a light in which they could see things of this kind. Even if they were given such light, their false beliefs would extinguish it. Then they would pass over teachings like this as if the words had been erased or deleted, or as if they were covered gutters that people step on and cross over. The purpose of these analogies is to make it known that without truths we do not see this teaching about the Lord, even though it is a key component of our regeneration.
</p>
<p>
[2] What of faith? Without truths, faith cannot even exist. Faith and truth are one with each other. The goodness within faith constitutes its soul, so to speak, and truths constitute its body. Therefore saying that we believe or have faith and yet knowing no truths related to faith is like extracting the soul from a body and then trying to have a conversation with that soul, even though it is invisible. All the truths that constitute faith's body emit light; they shine on the face of faith and make it visible.
<p>A similar thing is true of goodwill. It emits heat. The light of truth joins together with this heat, just as heat and light join together during springtime in this world and the two of them bring animals and plants on earth into a reproductive state again.
</p>
<p>
[3] The same thing happens with spiritual heat and light. They join together within us, when we are focused both on truths that relate to faith and on good actions that relate to goodwill. As indicated above in the chapter on faith, each truth that relates to faith gives off a light that shines, and each good action that relates to goodwill gives off a heat that lights a fire within us. The point is also made there that spiritual light is essentially intelligence, and spiritual heat is essentially love; the Lord alone combines these two in us as he is regenerating us. As the Lord says, "The words that I speak are spirit and are life" (<a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>). "Believe in the light, so that you may become children of the light. I have come into the world as a light" (<a href="3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>).
<p>The Lord is the sun of the spiritual world. All spiritual heat and light come from that sun. That light enlightens us; that heat kindles a fire within us. Through both of them working together in us, the Lord brings us to life and regenerates us. </p>

618. XII. Regeneration is impossible without truths through which faith may be formed, and with which charity may link itself.<p>There are three means by which a person is regenerated: the Lord, faith and charity. These three would lie as deeply hidden as the choicest gems buried underground, if they were not exposed by Divine truths from the Word. In fact they would be hidden from the sight of those who deny man's co-operation, even if they read the Word a hundred or a thousand times; yet there they stand out in bright light.<p>As regards the Lord, can anyone who has convinced himself of present-day faith open his eyes to see the following doctrines in it: that the Lord and the Father are one, and that He is the God of heaven and earth, and that it is the Father's will that people should believe in Him, as well as countless similar statements in both Testaments? The reason is that they are not in possession of truths, and so not in light which could make things of this sort plain to see. Even if they were given light, still their falsities would snuff it out, and then the truths would be passed over like phrases deleted, or like subterranean passages which people walk over and cross. These remarks have been made to make it known that without truths this first step towards regeneration could not be seen.</p>
<p>
[2] As regards faith, neither is that possible without truths, for faith and truth make a single entity. Good is like the soul of faith, and truths make up its body. So to talk of believing or having faith without knowing any of its truths is like pulling the soul out of the body and carrying on a conversation with that invisible object. Moreover, all the truths which make up the body of faith emit light, illuminating it and making its face visible. It is much the same with charity. This emits heat, with which the light of truth combines, just as in the world heat is combined with light in springtime, and this combination makes animals and plants on earth resume reproduction. It is much the same with spiritual heat and light. These likewise combine in a person, when he is in possession of the truths of faith and at the same time the kinds of good which make up charity. For, as I said before in the chapter on faith, there flows from each truth an illuminating light, and from each kind of good a heat which sets on fire. Spiritual light is in its essence intelligence, and spiritual heat is in its essence love. It is the Lord alone who combines these two when He regenerates a person. For the Lord said:<p>The words which I speak are spirit and life, <a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>.<p>Believe in the light, so that you may be sons of light. I have come a light to the world, <a href="3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>.<p>In the spiritual world the Lord is the sun, the source of all spiritual light and heat. That is the light which illuminates, the heat that sets on fire; and a person is quickened and regenerated by them both being combined. </p>

618. XII. REGENERATION IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT TRUTHS, BY WHICH FAITH IS FORMED AND WITH WHICH CHARITY CONJOINS ITSELF. <p>There are three means whereby man is regenerated, the Lord, faith, and charity. These three would lie hidden like the most costly jewels buried in the earth, if Divine truths from the Word did not reveal them. They would indeed be hidden from those who deny man's cooperation even if they were to read the Word a hundred or a thousand times, although they there stand forth in clear light. As concerns the Lord, who that is confirmed in the prevailing faith sees there with open eyes the declarations that He and the Father are one, that He is the God of heaven and earth, that it is the will of the Father that men should believe in the Son, with innumerable other statements of the same kind respecting the Lord in both Testaments? They do not see because they are not in truths, and consequently not in the light in which subjects of this kind can be seen; and if light were given, falsities would extinguish it, and these truths would then escape their attention like something wholly erased, or like underground drains which are trodden upon and passed over. These things are said that it may be known that without truths this first thing in regeneration cannot be seen.
</p>
<p>
[2] As to faith, neither is that possible without truths; because faith and truth make one thing; for the good of faith is like a soul, truths constituting its body. To say therefore that a man believes or has faith, when he is ignorant of all of its truths, is like taking the soul out of the body, and talking with it when thus invisible. Moreover, all the truths that make up the body of faith emit light and enlighten, and render the features of faith visible. It is the same with charity; this emits heat with which the light of truth conjoins itself, as heat does with light in the world in the time of spring, from the conjunction of which the animals and vegetables of the earth return to their prolifications.
</p>
<p>
[3] It is the same with spiritual heat and light; these in like manner conjoin themselves in man when he is in the truths of faith and at the same time in the goods of charity. For as said above in the chapter on Faith, from each particular truth of faith there flows forth a light that enlightens, and from each particular good of charity a heat that enkindles. It is also there said that spiritual light in its essence is intelligence, and spiritual heat in its essence is love; and that the Lord alone conjoins these two in man when He regenerates him. For the Lord said: The words that I speak unto you are spirit, and are life (<a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>). Believe in the light, that ye may be sons of light. I am come a light into the world (<a href="3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>). The Lord is the Sun in the spiritual world; this is the source of all spiritual light and heat; that light enlightens, and that heat enkindles; and by the conjunction of the two the Lord vivifies and regenerates man. </p>

618. XII. REGENERATION IS NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT TRUTHS, BY WHICH FAITH IS FORMED, AND WITH WHICH CHARITY CONJOINS ITSELF.<p>The regeneration of man is effected by three means, the Lord, faith and charity. These three would remain concealed like most precious jewels buried in the earth unless they were revealed by Divine truths from the Word; indeed they would remain hidden from the sight of those who deny man's co-operation, even if those were to read the Word a hundred or a thousand times, although they stand forth there in clear light. As to the Lord, no one who is confirmed in the faith of the present day can see, even with wide open eyes, these truths in it, that He and the Father are one, that He is the God of heaven and earth, and that it is the will of the Father than men should believe on the Son, with innumerable statements of the same kind respecting the Lord in both Testaments. They do not see because they are not in truths, and consequently not in the light from which such things can be seen; and if light were given them, still their falsities would extinguish it; and these truths would be passed over like words that are blotted out by erasure, or like underground passages which men trample underfoot as they walk across them. This may serve to show that without truths this first essential of regeneration is not perceived.</p>
<p>
[2] As to faith, it also is not possible without truths, for faith and truth make one, the good of faith being like a soul whose body is formed by truths. Therefore, if a man were to say that he believes, that is, has faith, and also were to know none of the truths of faith, he would be like one who removes the soul from the body, and converses with it, although it is thus invisible. Moreover, all truths which form the body of faith emit light by which they enlighten it, and render its face visible. The case is similar with charity; for this emits heat with which the light of truth enters into conjunction, as heat unites with light in springtime in the world, and from this union earth's animals and plants resume their prolific powers.</p>
<p>
[3] In like manner spiritual heat and light are conjoined in man, when he is in the truths of faith and at the same time in the goods of charity; for as was stated above in the chapter on Faith, from each particular truth of faith there flows a light which enlightens, and from each particular good of charity there is diffused a heat which enkindles. Now spiritual light in its essence is intelligence, and spiritual heat in its essence is love, and the Lord alone conjoins these two in man when He regenerates him; for the Lord said,<p>"The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life" <a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>.<p>"Believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light... I am come a light into the world" <a href="3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>.<p>The Lord is the Sun in the spiritual world, and from this come all spiritual light and heat. That light enlightens, and that heat enkindles, and by the conjunction of both He quickens and regenerates man. </p>

618. Quod Regeneratio non dabilis sit absque veris, per quae formatur Fides, et cum quibus se conjungit Charitas.<p>Sunt tria per quae homo regeneratur, Dominus, Fides et Charitas; haec tria laterent sicut celsissimae pretiositates infossae terrae, si non Divina vera ex Verbo aperirent illa, imo laterent coram illis, qui negant cooperationem, si vel centies vel millies legerent Verbum, tametsi ibi in clara luce exstant. Quod Dominum attinet, quis confirmatus in hodierna fide, aperto oculo videt haec ibi, quod Ipse et Pater unum sint, et quod Ipse sit Deus Coeli et Terrae, et quod Voluntas Patris sit, ut credant in Filium, praeter innumera similia de Domino in utroque Foedere; causa est, quia non in veris sunt, et inde non in luce, ex qua hujuscemodi possunt videri; et si daretur lux, usque falsa exstinguerent illam, et tunc praeterirentur sicut talia, quae lituris deleta sunt, aut sicut subterraneae fossae, quae calcantur et transeuntur: haec dicta sunt, ut sciatur, quod absque veris hoc primarium regenerationis non videatur.</p>
<p>
[2] Quod Fidem attinet, nec illa absque veris potest dari, fides enim et verum faciunt unam <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
rem; est enim bonum fidei sicut anima, et vera faciunt ejus corpus; quare dicere quod credat seu fidem habeat, et nulla vera ejus scire, est sicut animam ex corpore extrahere, et cum illa inconspicua loqui: praeterea omnia vera, quae fidei corpus faciunt, lucem a se emittunt, et illustrant, et sistunt faciem ejus videndam. Simile est cum charitate; haec a se emittit calorem, cum quo lux veri se conjungit, sicut facit calor cum luce tempore veris in Mundo; ex quorum conjunctione animalia et vegetabilia terrae in sua prolifica redeunt:</p>
<p>
[3] simile est cum Calore et Luce spirituali; haec se similiter conjungunt in homine, dum hic in veris fidei et simul in bonis charitatis est; nam ut supra in Capite de Fide dictum est, ex singulis veris fidei effluit lux quae illustrat, et ex singulis bonis charitatis effluit calor qui accendit; tum quod Lux spiritualis in sua essentia sit Intelligentia, et Calor spiritualis in sua essentia sit Amor, et quod Solus Dominus conjungat illa duo apud hominem, cum regenerat illum; dixit enim Dominus, Verba quae Ego loquor, spiritus et vita sunt, <a href="3927/john_6_63.htm">Johannes 6:63</a>.
