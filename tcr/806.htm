806. 灵界的英国人<p>人有两种思维方式, 一种是外在的, 一种是内在的。 在世时, 人运用外在的思维模式, 在灵界, 则运用内在的思维模式。 这两种模式在善人身上行动如一, 但在恶人身上则不然。 在尘世, 人的内在本质极少显明, 因为他从小就学习举止得体理性, 也喜欢这样表现。 但在灵界, 每个人的本质一看就知道, 因为那时他是一个灵, 灵就是内在人。 我曾被允许处于灵界, 看到了世界各国人民的内在性质, 我觉得有必要让人们了解这一切, 因为它很重要。 </p>

806. The British in the Spiritual World
<p>There are two states of thought within us - an external state and an internal state. In our outer thinking we are in the physical world, but in our inner thinking we are in the spiritual world. In good people, these two states act as a unit; in evil people they do not.
<p>What we are truly like inwardly is seldom obvious in the world, since we learn from early childhood to be moral and rational and we love to seem that way. In the spiritual world, though, what we are truly like is abundantly clear, because we are then a spirit, and our spirit is our inner self.
<p>Because I have been allowed to be in the spiritual world and see there what people from various nations are truly like inwardly, I have a duty to reveal this information, since it is important. </p>

806. The British <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
in the spiritual world.<p>Human beings have two modes of thinking, external and internal. In the natural world they use the external mode, in the spiritual world the internal. These two modes act as one in the case of the good, but not in the case of the wicked. It is rarely possible in the natural world to see what a person's interior is like, since he has learned from childhood to behave well and rationally, and he likes to seem to be so. But in the spiritual world everyone's nature is plain to see, for then he is a spirit, and the spirit is the internal man. Now because I have been allowed to be in that world and see there what internal men from different kingdoms are like, it is my duty, because of its importance, to make this generally known.<p>

806. THE ENGLISH IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD. <p>There are two states of thought in man, an external and an internal; in the external state he is in the natural world, in the internal in the spiritual world. In the good these states make one, but not in the evil. Man's internal nature is rarely manifest in the world, because from infancy he has learned to be moral and rational, and loves to appear such. But in the spiritual world it is clearly manifest what his nature is, for man is then a spirit, and a spirit is the internal man. And since it has been granted me to be in that world, and there to see the internal nature of men from different kingdoms of the world, I feel it necessary, because of its importance, to make this known. </p>

806. IV. THE ENGLISH IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD.<p>Man has two states of thought, external and internal. He is in the external in the natural world, and in the internal in the spiritual world. These two states of thought make one in the good, but not in the wicked. The nature of man as to his internal seldom becomes manifest in the world, because he has learned from infancy to be moral and rational, and he loves to appear so; but in the spiritual world its nature is clearly seen, for a man is then a spirit, and the spirit is the internal man. Now, as I have been permitted to be in the spiritual world, and to see there the nature of the internal man in people of different countries, it behooves me to make it known, for it is important. </p>

806. DE ANGLIS IN MUNDO SPIRITUALI.<p>Sunt duo Status cogitationis apud hominem, Externus et Internus; homo in Externo est in Mundo naturali, in Interno est in Mundo spirituali; hi Status unum faciunt apud bonos, sed non unum apud malos; qualis homo quoad Internum suum est, raro patet in Mundo, quoniam ab infantia didicit moralis et rationalis esse, et amat videri; sed in Mundo spirituali clare apparet qualis est, est enim tunc homo spiritus, ac spiritus est Internus homo. Nunc quia mihi datum est in illo Mundo esse, et ibi videre, quales Interni homines sunt ab uno Regno et ab altero, me oportet, quia interest, id manifestare. </p>
