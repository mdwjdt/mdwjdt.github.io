<h4 align="center"></h4>

<p><h4 align="center">新天堂与新教会的信仰</h4><br />1.在本书开头，我们以普遍和具体的形式阐述这信，以此作为本书的开篇，就像进入圣殿的入门和作为后续细节指南的概要。之所以称之为新天堂与新教会的信仰，是因为天使所在的天堂和世人构成的教会行如一体，就像内在人和外在人。所以，教会成员若拥有信之真所产生的爱之善和爱之善所产生的信之真，就其心智的内在而言，便是一位天堂天使。因此，他死后会进入天堂，在那里照其爱与信结合的状态得享幸福。要知道，在新天堂，也就是主如今正建立的天堂，这信是它的开端、入门和概要。</p>

<p>
1. 前言:新天國與新教會的信仰
<p>首先, 將本書中所講述的真實的基督徒信仰, 也就是新天國和新教會的信仰, 分別以總體和具體的形式概要地說明。作為接下來全書的引言, 或作為進入聖殿的大門, 又或作為詳細內容的概要。此信仰被稱為新天國和新教會的信仰, 因為天人(angel)組成的天國和世人組成的教會, 如同一個人的靈魂與肉體, 內外一致,行動如一。因此, 若教會之人活在良善與真理之中, 對於思想內在而言, 他就是天國的一名天人。在肉身死後, 他便進入天國, 照著良善與真理在他裡面聯合的狀態在那裡安享極樂。當知道, 在主現在正建立的新天國中, 這樣的信仰是新天國的引言,入門和概要。 </p>

<p>
1. True Christianity<p>Containing a Comprehensive Theology of the New Heaven and the New Church
<p>The Faith of the New Heaven and the New Church
<p>THE faith of the new heaven and the new church is stated here in both universal and specific forms to serve as the face of the work that follows, the doorway that allows entry into the temple, and the summary that in one way or another contains all the details to follow. I say "the faith of the new heaven and the new church" because heaven, where there are angels, and the church, in which there are people, act together like the inner and the outer levels in a human being. People in the church who love what is good because they believe what is true and who believe what is true because they love what is good are angels of heaven with regard to the inner levels of their minds. After death they come into heaven, and enjoy happiness there according to the relationship between their love and their faith. It is important to know that the new heaven that the Lord is establishing today has this faith as its face, doorway, and summary. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #1 (Chadwick, 1988)</h4>

<p>
1. THE FAITH OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW CHURCH<p>A statement of faith, set out in both universal and particular terms, is placed at the beginning to serve as a preface to the book which follows, to be like a doorway leading into a church, and a summary presenting in a short compass what follows at more length. It is called the faith of the new heaven and the new church, because heaven, where the angels are, and the church among men form a single unit, just as the internal and external sides of the personality make up a single individual. This is why a member of the church who possesses the good of love which arises from the truths of faith, and possesses the truths of faith which arise from the good of love, is, so far as the interiors of his mind are concerned, an angel of heaven. Therefore too after dying he comes into heaven, and there enjoys happiness depending upon how far the good and truth are linked. It should be known that in the new heaven, which is at the present time being established by the Lord, this statement of faith serves as its preface, doorway and summary. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #1 (Ager, 1970)</h4>

<p>
1. THE FAITH OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND OF THE NEW CHURCH <p>This faith is first set forth in a universal and in a particular form, that it may serve as a preface set before the work that follows, also as a gate giving entrance to a temple, and as a summary, containing in their own mode the particulars that succeed. It is called the faith of the New Heaven and of the New Church because heaven which is the abode of angels, and the church which is made up of men, act as a one, like the internal and the external man; consequently the man of the church who is in the good of love from the truths of faith and in the truths of faith from the good of love, is, in respect to the interiors of his mind, an angel of heaven; and being such he after death enters heaven and there enjoys happiness in proportion to the state of conjunction of his love and faith. Let it be known that in the New Heaven, which the Lord is now establishing, this faith is its preface, gate, and summary. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #1 (Dick, 1950)</h4>

<p>
1. THE TRUE CHRISTIAN RELIGION<p>Containing THE UNIVERSAL THEOLOGY OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW CHURCH<p>THE FAITH OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW CHURCH<p>This faith is presented at the outset in its general and in its particular form. It is so presented that it may serve as a preface to the whole work which follows, as a gateway, as it were, by which entrance is made to a temple, and as an epitome in which the subsequent details are duly summarized. It is said to be "The Faith of the New Heaven and the New Church" because heaven, where angels are, and the Church, in which men are, act as one like the internal and the external with man. Hence it is that the member of the Church, who is in the good of love from the truths of faith, and in the truths of faith from the good of love, is an angel of heaven as to the interiors of his mind. Thus he enters into heaven after death, and there enjoys happiness according to the degree in which those principles are united in him. It should therefore be known that this faith in its summary form is the index and gateway of the new heaven now being formed by the Lord. </p>


<h4 align="center">Vera Christiana Religio #1 (original Latin,1770)</h4>

<p>
1. VERA CHRISTIAN RELIGIO,<p>CONTINENS UNIVERSAM THEOLOGIAM NOVI COELI ET NOVAE ECCLESIAE<p>FIDES NOVI COELI ET NOVAE ECCLESIAE.<p>Fides in forma universali et singulari praemittitur, ut sit sicut Facies ante Opus, quod sequitur; ac ut sit sicut Porta, per quam fit ingressus in Templum; utque sit Summarium, in quo singula quae sequuntur, suo modo continentur. Dicitur Fides Novi Coeli et Novae Ecclesiae, quia Coelum ubi sunt Angeli, et Ecclesia in qua Homines, unum agunt sicut Internum et Externum apud hominem; inde est quod homo Ecclesiae, qui in bono amoris ex veris fidei est, ac in veris fidei ex bono amoris, sit quoad interiora mentis suae Angelus coeli, quare etiam post mortem in Coelum venit, et ibi fruitur felicitate secundum statum conjunctionis illorum. Sciendum est, quod in Novo Coelo, quod hodie a Domino instauratur, sit haec Fides, facies, porta et summarium ejus. </p>
