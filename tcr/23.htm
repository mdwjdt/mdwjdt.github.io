<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>23</b>.⑷神性存在和彰显本身不可能产生也是存在和彰显本身的另一个神性。所以，具有相同本质的另一位神是不可能的。前面已说明，独一神，宇宙的创造者，是存在和彰显本身，因而本身就是神。由此可知，源于神的神是不可能的，因为神性的真正本质就是存在和彰显本身，不可能存在于另一个神里面。无论你说“从神生的”还是“从神发出的”，都没什么区别，二者都暗含是神产生的，这与被造的区别不大。因此，将“存在三个神性位格，其中每一位单独为神，具有相同本质，一个从永恒生出，另一个从永恒发出”的信仰引入教会，彻底摧毁了神一体性的观念，以及它所具有的一切神性观念，从而使理性的全部灵性被逐出。于是，人不再是人，而是完全属世，除了会说话外，其它方面与动物无异，并且还反对教会的一切属灵之物，因为属世人称其为愚蠢。这就是充斥整个世界关于神的可怕异端邪说的源头，且是唯一源头。因此，将圣三一分裂为位格，不仅使教会陷入黑夜，还陷入死亡。<br />三个相同的神性本质是对理性的冒犯，天使向我清楚表明这一点。他们声称，他们甚至无法张嘴说出“三个平等的神性”这句话。若有人向他们走来，想说这句话，他会情不自禁地背过身去；说出这句话后，他变得象人的躯干，并被丢了下去，然后加入到地狱中那些不承认任何神的人中。事实上，若将三个神性位格的观念植入在小孩子或少年人的心里，而这个观念不可避免地带有三个神的观念，就等于夺去他们的一切灵奶，然后夺去其一切灵粮，最后夺去一切属灵的理性，并给那些确信它的人带来灵性的死亡。区别是这样：那些有信且发自内心敬拜一位神，宇宙的创造者，将祂作为救世主和再造者来敬拜的人就象神殿建成后，大卫时代的锡安城和所罗门时代的耶路撒冷城；而信三个位格，且每一个单独为神的教会，则象被韦斯帕西安（罗马皇帝）摧毁的锡安城和耶路撒冷城，以及那里被焚毁的神殿。而且，人若敬拜一位神，祂里面有一个圣三一，因而是一个位格，就会越来越变成有活力的、天使般的人；而他若因数个位格而确信数位神，就会逐渐变得象一个有活动肢体的雕像，而撒旦就站在里面，并通过人造的嘴巴说话。</p>

23. (4)神性根本和表現本身不可能產生另一個同為根本和表現本身的神性; 因此同樣本質的另一位上帝是不可能的。
<p>如前所述, 創造宇宙的這位上帝, 是根本和表現自身, 就是上帝在自身之中。由此可知, 上帝從上帝而來是不可能的。無論你說"上帝所生的"或"由上帝生的", 任何一個都表示產生於上帝。這樣的表達雖與被造有分別,但分別甚小。因此, 三個神性位格,每個獨自是上帝,三個位格有同樣的本質,其中一位從永遠被生出,第三位從永遠被發出, 以上的信條被引進教會, 只會全然摧毀上帝的唯一, 以及全部神性的概念, 令屬靈成份被驅逐。於是, 人不再是人, 而是全然的物質, 與野獸的分別僅在於人有說話的能力; 與教會所有屬靈事物相對立, 因此變得愚蠢。這是產生關於上帝的荒謬異端邪說的源頭, 且是唯一源頭。因此, 將聖三一分割為三位, 不只是把教會帶向黑夜, 更是帶向死亡。
<p>[2]三個神性實質本來就是對理性的一種衝擊。天人的反應讓我證實這點, 他們聲稱無法從口中說出"三個平等的神性"。倘若任何人在他們面前試圖出這樣的詞句, 都難以啟齒, 只好轉身離開。倘若強行發出這些聲音, 他們會像木頭人被甩擲在地, 然後直投向地獄,與不認上帝的那些在一起。
<p>事實上, 一個孩子或少年人的思想中被植入三個神性位格的想法, 不可避免地粘附上三位上帝的念頭。這樣就會奪去他們所有靈奶,接著所有的靈糧, 最後所有屬靈分析的能力, 更將屬靈的死亡帶給那些還自行確證如此想法的人。那些在信仰和內心敬拜一位上帝為宇宙的創造者, 敬拜祂既是救贖者亦為更新者, 他們就會如同大衛時期的錫安, 和所羅門時期聖殿建好後的耶路撒冷城。而一個教會若相信三個位格,每個位格獨自是上帝, 就像被羅馬皇帝奧古斯都推翻並燒毀聖殿的錫安和耶路撒冷城。而且, 若人敬拜聖三一的上帝,祂只是一位, 這人會變成靈性活潑的,天人般的人。而人若相信而且去確證三個位格的存在,因而有三位上帝的信念, 逐漸變成如同有活動關節的雕像, 撒旦在裡面通過雕像之口來說話。 </p>

23. 4. The intrinsic, underlying divine reality and intrinsic capacity to become manifest cannot produce anything else divine that is intrinsically real and has an intrinsic capacity to become manifest. Therefore another God of the same essence is impossible. Up to this point I have shown that the one God, the Creator of the universe, is the intrinsic underlying reality and capacity to become manifest. Therefore he is intrinsically God. From this it follows that a god from a god is not possible, because such a god would necessarily lack absolute and essential divinity in the form of intrinsic underlying reality and capacity to become manifest. It does not matter whether that god is said to be "born" of God or to emanate from him, he would still be produced by God, which is scarcely different from being created by him.
<p>To introduce into the church the belief that there are three divine persons, each of whom is individually God, although they share a single essence, and to say that one of them was eternally begotten and the third has been having an effect from eternity, is to destroy completely the concept of one God. Along with that it is also to eradicate the whole notion of divinity and to drive all reasoned spirituality into exile. No longer truly human, human beings are becoming earthly in every respect. The only difference between them and wild animals is that they can talk. They are against anything and everything spiritual about the church - the earthly self calls all that delusional.
<p>These hideous heresies about God have poured out of one source alone: the earthly self. Dividing the divine Trinity into persons has brought about not only nighttime in the church, but also death.
</p>
<p>
[2] The concept of three divine essences that are the same is an offense to reason, as I learned from angels. They said that even pronouncing "three equal divinities" is impossible for them. They said that if someone came to them and tried to say it, that person would automatically turn away. After saying it the person would become like a human log and would be thrown away downward, headed for those in hell who do not acknowledge the existence of any God.
<p>Truly, to implant in toddlers, children, and teenagers the idea of three divine persons - which inevitably entails the idea of three gods - is to take away all their spiritual breast milk, and then all their spiritual solid food, and later on all the spiritual food for their reason, and, in the case of those who convince themselves of that point of view, to cause their spiritual death.
<p>On the one hand, those who direct heartfelt, faithful worship to one God alone as Creator of the universe, and as Redeemer and Regenerator as well, are comparable to the city of Zion in the time of David, and the city of Jerusalem in the time of Solomon after the Temple was built. On the other hand, the church that believes in three persons and views each person as an individual god is like Zion and Jerusalem after they had been destroyed by Vespasian and the Temple there had been burned down.
<p>Those who worship one God in whom there is a divine trinity and who is therefore one person become more and more alive, and become angels on earth. Those, however, who convince themselves to believe in a plurality of gods because there is a plurality of divine persons become more and more like a statue with movable joints, inside which stands Satan, talking through its hinged mouth. </p>

23. (iv) THE DIVINE BEING AND COMING-INTO-BEING IN ITSELF CANNOT GIVE RISE TO ANOTHER DIVINE WHICH IS BEING AND COMING-INTO-BEING IN ITSELF. CONSEQUENTLY ANOTHER GOD OF THE SAME ESSENCE IS IMPOSSIBLE.<p>It has so far been shown that the one God, the Creator of the universe, is Being and Coming-into-Being in itself, thus God in Himself. It follows from this that a God derived from God is impossible, because the very Essential of the Divine, which is Being and Coming-into-Being in itself, cannot exist in that other God. It makes no difference whether you say 'begotten by God', or 'proceeding from God'; both imply being produced by God, and there is little difference between this and being created. Therefore the introduction into the church of the belief that there are three Divine persons, each of whom is severally God and of the same essence, and one born from eternity, and a third proceeding from eternity, has the effect of utterly destroying the idea of the oneness of God, and with this all comprehension of Divinity, thus causing the whole of the spiritual side of the reason to be banished. This makes a human being no longer human, but totally and in all respects natural, in other words no different from an animal but for the power of speech; and it makes him an opponent of all the spiritual values of the church, since the natural man calls these mere ravings. This is the only source of such gross heresies about God as have flooded the world. On account of this the division of the Divine Trinity into persons has plunged the church not merely into darkness but into death.</p>
<p>
[2] The idea of three Divine Essences which are the same is an offence to reason, as was made clear to me by angels who said that they cannot so much as utter the words 'three equal Divinities'; and if anyone came to them and wanted to say this he could not help turning his back on them; after saying it he would become like a human trunk and be cast down, subsequently going off to join those in hell who acknowledge no God. The truth is that to put in the mind of a small child or boy the idea of three Divine persons, which inevitably carries with it the idea of three gods, is to take away all spiritual suckling, and then all spiritual nourishment, and finally all spiritual rationality, and to bring about the spiritual death of those who become convinced of it. The distinction is this: those who in faith and in their hearts worship one God, the Creator of the universe, who is at the same time the Redeemer and Regenerator, are like the city of Zion in the time of David and the city of Jerusalem in Solomon's time, after the building of the Temple; but the church that believes in three persons, and in each as an individual God, is like the city of Zion and Jerusalem when they had been destroyed by Vespasian, and the Temple there had been burnt down. To go further, a person who worships one God in whom is the Divine Trinity and so is a single Person, becomes more and more alive and an angelic person; but one who lets a plurality of persons convince him of a plurality of gods becomes by degrees like a puppet with movable limbs, with Satan standing inside and talking through his jointed mouth. </p>

23. (4) It is impossible for the Divine Esse and Existere in itself to produce another Divine which is Esse and Existere in itself; therefore another God of the same Essence is impossible. It has been shown already that the one God who is the Creator of the universe, is Esse and Existere in itself, that is, God in Himself; and from this it follows that God from God is impossible, because in such a being the verily essential Divine, which is Esse and Existere in itself, is impossible. It is the same whether you say "begotten of God" or "proceeding from God;" it means, in either case, produced by God, and this differs but little from being created. <p>Therefore, to introduce into the church a belief in three Divine persons each of whom singly is God, and of the same essence, one of them born from eternity, and a third proceeding from eternity, is to destroy utterly the idea of God's unity, and with it every idea of Divinity, and so cause all the spirituality of reason to be driven into exile. Then man is man no longer; but is so wholly natural as to differ from a beast only in the power of speech, and is opposed to all the spiritual things of the church, for these the natural man calls foolishness. This is the source and only source from which have sprung the monstrous heresies concerning God; and thus the division of the Divine trinity into persons has introduced into the church not night alone but death as well.
</p>
<p>
[2] That the identity of three Divine Essences is an offense to reason was made evident to me by angels, who said that they could not even utter the words "three equal divinities" and that if anyone should come into their presence wishing to utter these words he could not but turn himself away; and after uttering them he would become like the trunk of a man, and would be hurled downward; and would afterwards betake himself to those in hell who do not acknowledge any God. The truth is that to implant in the mind of a child or youth the idea of three Divine persons, to which inevitably the idea of three Gods clings, is to deprive it of all spiritual milk, and then of all spiritual food, and finally of all ability to reason spiritually, and to bring spiritual death upon those who confirm themselves in that idea. The difference between those who in faith and heart worship one God as the Creator of the universe, and those who worship Him as both the Redeemer and the Regenerator, is like the difference between the city of Zion in the time of David and the city of Jerusalem in the time of Solomon after the temple had been built; while a church that believes in three persons and in each as a distinct God, is like the city of Zion and Jerusalem after it had been overthrown by Vespasian and the temple burned. Furthermore, the man who worships one God in whom is a Divine trinity, and who is thus one Person, becomes more and more a living and angelic man; while he who confirms himself in a belief in a plurality of Gods from believing in a plurality of persons, gradually becomes like a statue with movable joints, within which Satan stands and speaks through its artificial mouth. </p>

23. (4) THE DIVINE BEING (Esse) AND EXISTING (Existere) IN ITSELF CANNOT PRODUCE ANOTHER DIVINE THAT IS BEING AND EXISTING IN ITSELF; CONSEQUENTLY THERE CANNOT BE ANOTHER GOD OF THE SAME ESSENCE.<p>It has been shown above that the one God, who is the Creator of the universe, is Being and Existing in itself, and thus God in Himself. Hence it follows that there cannot be a God from God, because the very Essential Divine, which is Being and Existing in itself, could not exist in another. It is the same thing whether the phrase "begotten of God" or "proceeding from Him" is used; it still implies that he is produced by God, and this differs little from being created by Him. Therefore to introduce into the Church the faith that there are three Divine Persons, each of whom singly is God and of the same Essence, and one born from eternity and the third proceeding from eternity, is to destroy utterly the idea of the unity of God, and with it all idea of Divinity, and so banish all spirituality from the rational mind. The consequence is that man is no longer man but merely a creature of nature, differing from the beast only in that he has the power of speech. He is also opposed to all that is spiritual in the Church, for the natural man calls it foolishness. This is the sole reason for the great heresies concerning God that have arisen; so that the separation of the Divine Trinity into Persons has brought upon the Church not only night but also spiritual death.</p>
<p>
[2] That an identity of three Divine Essences is an offence to reason was made manifest to me from angels, who declared that they could not utter the expression "three equal divinities." Moreover, if any one were to approach them with the intention of uttering it, he would be forced to turn back; and if he were to utter it, he would become like a human log and be thrown down. He would then depart to join those in hell who acknowledge no God. The truth is that to implant in infants and young people the idea of three Divine Persons, with which is inevitably associated the idea of three Gods, is to deprive them of all spiritual milk, thereafter of all spiritual food, and finally of all spiritual reason, with the result that spiritual death is brought upon those who confirm themselves in such an idea. Those who in faith and heart worship one God, the Creator of the universe, and also the Redeemer and Regenerator, are as the city of Zion in the time of David, and as the city of Jerusalem in the time of Solomon after the Temple was built. The Church, however, which believes in three Persons, and in each as a distinct God, is like the city of Zion and Jerusalem after their destruction by Vespasian, <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
and like the Temple there destroyed by fire. Further, the man who worships one God, in whom is the Divine Trinity, becomes more and more alive and angelic; but he who confirms his belief in a plurality of Gods from a plurality of Persons becomes more and more like a lay-figure, fashioned with movable joints, within which stands Satan, speaking through its jointed mouth.<p>

dabile est in illo; perinde est, sive dicatur a Deo gigni, sive procedere, est tamen usque a Deo produci, et hoc parum differt a <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
creari; quare introducere in Ecclesiam fidem, quod sint tres Divinae Personae, quarum quaelibet singulatim est Deus, et ejusdem Essentiae, ac unus natus ab aeterno, et tertius procedens ab aeterno, est prorsus abolere ideam Unitatis Dei, et cum hac omnem notionem Divinitatis, et sic efficere ut omne Spirituale rationis in exilium ejiciatur; inde homo non fit homo amplius, sed totus quantus Naturalis, qui non plus differt a bestia, quam quod loqui possit, et qui est contra omnia spiritualia Ecclesiae, haec enim naturalis homo vocat deliria; inde et non aliunde tam enormia haeretica de Deo scaturiverunt: quapropter Divina Trinitas divisa in Personas intulit non modo noctem in Ecclesiam, sed etiam mortem.</p>
<p>
[2] Quod identitas trium Essentiarum Divinarum sit rationis scandalum, constitit mihi ex Angelis, qui dixerunt, quod ne quidem possint enuntiare tres Divinitates aequales; et si quis ad illos veniret, et vellet enuntiare, non posset quin avertat se, et quod post enuntiationem fiat sicut truncus humanus, et projiciatur deorsum, et postea abeat ad illos in Inferno, qui non aliquem Deum agnoscunt. Veritas est, quod implantare infanti et puero ideam trium Personarum Divinarum, cui inevitabiliter adhaeret idea trium deorum, sit auferre illis omne lacticinium spirituale, et deinde omnem cibatum Spiritualem, et demum omne ratiocinium spirituale, et apud illos, qui se in eo confirmant, inducere mortem spiritualem. Discrimen inter illos, qui fide et corde colunt unum Deum Creatorem Universi, et Hunc simul Redemptorem et Regeneratorem, est sicut fuit Urbs Zion tempore Davidis, et Urbs Hierosolymae tempore Salomonis, postquam Templum aedificatum est; at Ecclesia, quae credit in tres Personas, et in unamquamque ut in singularem Deum, est similis urbi Zioni et Hierosolymae a Vespasiano destructis, et Templo ibi incenso. Porro, homo, qui colit unum Deum, in Quo Divina Trinitas est, et sic qui una Persona est, fit plus et plus vivus, et homo angelus; at qui se in pluralitate Deorum ex pluralitate Personarum confirmat, fit successive sicut Statua facta cum articulis mobilibus, in cujus medio stat Satanas, et loquitur per os articulatum ejus.<p>
