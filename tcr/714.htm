714. To keep all the individual components in their proper arrangement and connection there need to be universal categories that allow those components to come into being and within which they find continued existence. It is also necessary that the individual components bear some resemblance to their universal category. Otherwise the whole would perish and so would all its parts.
<p>This interrelationship has allowed all things in the universe to be preserved in their integrity from the first day of creation until now and to remain so into the future.
<p>As we know, everything in the universe has a relationship to goodness and truth. The reason why this is the case is that everything was created by God out of the divine goodness of love by means of the divine truth of wisdom. Take anything whatever - an animal, a bush, a rock: these three universal qualities are in some way inscribed on it. </p>

714. For particulars to be kept in their proper order and relationship there must be universals, from which they come into being and in which they continue in being. The particulars must also in some way be an image of the universals to which they refer; other-wise the whole world would cease to exist along with its parts. It is this relationship which ensures that everything in the universe has been preserved intact from the first day of creation down to the present, and will continue into the future. It is well known that everything in the universe has reference to good and truth. The reason is that all things were created by God from the Divine good of love by means of the Divine truth of wisdom. Take anything you like, whether animal, plant or stone, and those three most universal principles are imprinted on it in some relationship or other. </p>

714. That particulars may be retained in their order and connection, it is necessary that there should be universals from which they spring and in which they rest; and it is also necessary that particulars should in a certain image answer to their universals, otherwise the whole would perish together with its parts. This relation has caused all things in the universe to be preserved in their integrity, from the first day of creation until now, and to still continue. That all things in the universe have relation to good and truth is well known. This is because all things were created by God from the Divine good of love by means of the Divine truth of wisdom. Take anything you please, an animal, a shrub, or a stone, and you will find these three most universal principles inscribed upon them in a kind of relationship. </p>

714. That particulars may be held together in their order and connection, it is necessary that there should be fundamental universals, from which they exist and in which they subsist. It is also necessary that particulars should image forth their universals by a certain degree of resemblance; otherwise the whole would perish with its parts. It is owing to this relationship that all things in the universe have been preserved in their integrity from the first day of creation to the present time, and will continue to be so. It is known that all things in the universe have relation to good and truth, because all things were created by God from the Divine Good of Love by means of the Divine Truth of Wisdom. Take whatever you please, an animal, a shrub, or a stone, and you will find that there is inscribed upon it, in some sort of relationship, those three fundamental universals. </p>

714. Ut Singularia contineantur in suo ordine et nexu, necessum est ut sint Universalia a quibus existunt, et in quibus subsistunt; et quoque necessum est, ut Singularia in quadam imagine referant sua Universalia, alioquin periret totum cum partibus; haec Relatio facit, ut omnia universi conservata sint in sua integritate a primo Creationis die huc usque et ulterius; quod omnia in Universo se referant ad bonum et verum, notum est; causa est quia omnia a Deo ex Divino Bono amoris per Divinum Verum Sapientiae creata sunt. Sume quodcunque libet sive animal, sive fruticem, sive lapidem; sunt illa tria universalissima in quadam relatione illis inscripta. </p>
