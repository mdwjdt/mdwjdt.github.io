758. The fact that everything the Lord said then to his disciples was about the time when the Christian church would come to an end is very clear from the Book of Revelation, which contains similar predictions about the close of the age and the Lord's Coming. Each verse of the Book of Revelation is explained in Revelation Unveiled (published in 1766). Since the points that the Lord made to his disciples about the close of the age and his Coming align with the points regarding the same events that he later revealed through John in the Book of Revelation, it is abundantly clear that the Lord was not referring to any other end than the end of the Christian church that exists today. There are also prophecies about the end of this church in Daniel; this is why the Lord says, "When you see that the abomination of desolation foretold by the prophet Daniel is standing in the holy place, let those who read note it well" (<a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>). There are similar passages in the other prophets.
</p>
<p>
[2] The appendix will show further that the abomination of desolation exists today within the Christian church. It will demonstrate that there is not one single genuine truth left in the church, and that if a new church were not raised up to take the place of the church that exists today, "No flesh would be saved," as the Lord says in <a href="3927/matthew_24_22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>.<p>Strange to say, though, the fact that the Christian church of today is severely devastated and is at its end is not at all apparent to those on earth who have become adamantly devoted to the church's false teachings. The reason for this is that becoming adamantly devoted to a teaching that is false is the same as denying a teaching that is true. Such people place a heavy tarpaulin over the doorway to their intellect to prevent anything from sneaking into their mind and pulling down the tent poles and ropes that they have used to shape and reinforce their theological system.
<p>If our rational faculty is earthly in nature, it is capable of supporting any notion it wishes to. It is equally capable of giving support to something false as it is to something true. Once a given idea has been reinforced in us, truth and falsity appear in the same light. We lose the ability to tell the difference between the dim, deceptive light we experience in a dream and the true light of day.
<p>If our rational faculty is spiritual in nature, though, it is quite the opposite. How do we develop spiritual rationality? We turn to the Lord and he gives us a love for what is true. </p>

758. All the things the Lord spoke of with the disciples were said about the final period of the Christian church; this is obvious from Revelation, where similar predictions are made about the ending of the age and the Lord's coming. All of these were explained in detail in Apocalypse Revealed (published in 1766). Now since what the Lord told His disciples about the ending of the age and His coming is in agreement with His later disclosures on the same subjects through John in Revelation, it is perfectly clear that He meant no other ending than that of the present-day Christian church. Moreover, there was a prophecy about the end of this church in Daniel, and this is why the Lord says:<p>When you see the abomination of desolation, foretold by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let him who reads take due note) ... <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>.<p>There are similar remarks in the other prophets.</p>
<p>
[2] Such is the abomination of desolation in the Christian church at the present time, as will be plain from the Appendix, which will show that there is not a single real truth left in the church, and also that unless a new church is raised up to take the place of the present one, no flesh can be saved, as the Lord said in Matthew (<a href="3927/matthew_24_22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>). It is impossible for those on earth who have convinced themselves of their false beliefs to see that the Christian church, as it is at the present time, is to such an extent brought to an end and laid waste. The reason is that the strengthening of falsity is the denial of truth. It therefore places as it were a curtain beneath the understanding, and by this means takes care that nothing else creeps in, which might wreck the ropes and stakes which hold up the system of thought he has built and formed like a rigid tent. In addition, the natural faculty of reason can prove whatever it likes, the false as much as the true. Each of these appears when proved in similar light, and there is no way of telling whether it is deceptive light such as one encounters in dreams, or true light like that of day. But it is quite different with the spiritual faculty of reason possessed by those who look to the Lord and under His guidance love truth. </p>

758. That all these things which the Lord spoke about with His disciples were said of the last time of the Christian church, is very evident from the Apocalypse, where there are like predictions respecting the consummation of the age and the coming of the Lord, all of which are explained in detail in the Apocalypse Revealed, published in 1766. Because, then, what the Lord said in the presence of His disciples respecting the consummation of the age and His coming, coincides with what was afterward revealed by John in the Apocalypse respecting the same subjects, it is clearly evident that He meant no other consummation than that of the present Christian church. Moreover, there is a further prophecy in Daniel respecting the end of this church; therefore the Lord says: <p>When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, predicted by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, let him that readeth note it well (<a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>). <p>There are like things in the other prophets. That such an abomination of desolation exists today in the Christian church will be made still more clear in an Appendix, in which it will be seen that there is not a single genuine truth remaining in the church, and also that unless a new church shall be raised up in the place of the present one, "no flesh can be saved," according to the Lord's words in Matthew (<a href="3927/matthew_24_22.htm">24:22</a>). That the Christian church, as it is today, is consummated and devastated to such an extent, those on the earth who have confirmed themselves in its falsity are unable to see, for the reason that the confirmation of falsity is the denial of truth; and this imposes a veil as it were upon the understanding, whereby it is protected from the entrance of anything that might pull up the ropes and stakes, by which its system, like a strong tent, has been built and shaped. To this may be added that the natural rational faculty is able to confirm whatever it pleases, thus falsity and truth equally; and when confirmed, they both appear in a similar light, and it is not known whether the light is illusive like that in a dream, or true like that of day. But the spiritual rational faculty, which those possess who look to the Lord, and from Him are in the love of truth, is wholly different. </p>

758. All those things which the Lord said to the disciples were spoken concerning the last phase of the Christian Church. This is evident from the Revelation, where similar events are foretold concerning the consummation of the age and His Coming, which are all explained in detail in the Apocalypse Revealed, published in the year 1766. Now since what the Lord said to His disciples concerning the consummation of the age and His Coming coincides with what He afterwards revealed in the Revelation by John on the same subjects, it is clearly evident that He meant no other consummation than that of the present Christian Church. Moreover, the end of this Church is also foretold in Daniel; and, therefore, the Lord says,<p>"When ye... shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand)" <a href="3927/matthew_24_16.htm">Matthew 24:16</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>;<p>and there are similar passages in the other Prophets. It will also be made clear in the Appendix that there is at this day such an abomination of desolation in the Christian Church; for there it will be seen that not a single genuine truth remains in the present Church; and also that unless a new Church were to be raised up in its place, "No flesh could be saved," according to the Lord's words in <a href="3927/matthew_24_22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>.<p>That the Christian Church, as it exists to-day, is so consummated and vastated, cannot be seen by those on earth who have confirmed themselves in its falsities, because a confirmation of falsity is a denial of the truth. This confirmation spreads as it were a veil over the understanding, and thereby prevents the entrance of any thing else which might pull up the ropes and stakes by means of which it has built up and fashioned its theological system like a strong tabernacle. Moreover, the natural rational can confirm whatever it pleases, the false as well as the true; both, when confirmed, appear in a similar light; and it is not known whether this is a delusive light, such as appears in a dream, or true light, such as appears in the day. But the spiritual rational is wholly different; and those are in it who look to the Lord, and from Him are in the light of truth. </p>

758. Quod omnia illa, quae Dominus cum Discipulis loquutus est, de ultimo tempore Ecclesiae Christianae dicta sint, manifeste patet ex Apocalypsi, ubi similia de Consummatione saeculi et de Adventu Ipsius, praedicuntur, quae omnia in APOCALYPSI REVELATA Anno 1766 edita, singulatim explicata sunt: nunc quia illa, quae Dominus de Consummatione saeculi et de Adventu suo coram Discipulis dixit, coincidunt cum illis, quae postea in Apocalypsi per Johannem de iisdem revelavit, patet clare, quod non aliam Consummationem, quam Ecclesiae hodiernae Christianae, intellexerit. Praeterea de hujus Ecclesiae fine etiam apud Danielem prophetatum est, quare dicit Dominus, Cum videritis abominationem desolationis, praedictam a Daniele Propheta, stantem in loco sancto, qui legit probe notet, <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthaeus 24:15</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>, similiter etiam apud reliquos Prophetas.</p>
<p>
[2] Quod talis Abominatio desolationis hodie sit in Ecclesia Christiana, adhuc patebit ex Appendice, in qua videbitur, quod non unicum genuinum verum in Ecclesia residuum sit, et quoque quod nisi Nova Ecclesia loco hodiernae exsuscitetur, Nulla caro salvari possit, secundum Verba Domini apud <a href="3927/matthew_24_22.htm">Matthaeum 24:22</a>. Quod Ecclesia Christiana, qualis est hodie, in tantum consummata et vastata sit, non videri potest ab illis in terra, qui se in falsis ejus confirmaverunt; causa est, quia confirmatio falsi est negatio veri, quare ponit sicut velum sub intellectu, et per id custodit, ne quid aliud subintret, quod convellit ejus funes et palos, per quos systematicum suum sicut tentorium firmum aedificavit et conformavit. Accedit, quod Rationale naturale confirmare possit quicquid lubet, ita aeque falsum ac verum, et quando confirmatum est, apparet utrumque in simili luce, et non cognoscitur Numeri lux fatua sit, qualis datur in somnio, vel num sit lux vera, qualis datur in die: sed aliter prorsus Rationale spirituale, in quo sunt illi qui spectant ad Dominum, et ab Ipso in Amore veri sunt. </p>
