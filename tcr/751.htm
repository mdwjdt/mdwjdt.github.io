751. After people were settled into their places, the priest went up into the pulpit and preached a sermon that was full of the spirit of wisdom. The topic was the holiness of Sacred Scripture and the Lord's union with both worlds, the spiritual and the physical, that the Word provides. Because of the enlightenment the preacher had, the sermon convinced the listeners that that holy book was dictated by Jehovah the Lord, and that therefore he is in it to such a degree that he is the wisdom it contains. Nevertheless that wisdom, which is the Lord himself, lies hidden beneath the literal meaning and is accessible only to people who are interested in theological truth and are engaged in living rightly as well; these are the people who are in the Lord and whom the Lord is in.
<p>After the sermon, he finished with a heartfelt prayer, and came down from the pulpit.
<p>As the congregation was leaving, the angel asked the priest to greet the ten newcomers. The priest joined their group. Their conversation lasted for about half an hour. The priest talked about the divine Trinity and said that it exists within Jesus Christ, since according to the apostle Paul, all the fullness of divinity dwells physically in him [<a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>]. Then they talked about the union of goodwill and faith; but the preacher spoke of it as the union of goodwill and truth, because faith is truth. </p>

751. When they were assembled, the priest went up into the pulpit and preached a sermon full of the spirit of wisdom. Its subject was the holiness of Sacred Scripture, and how by its means the Lord is linked with both the spiritual and the natural worlds. The enlightenment he enjoyed enabled him to prove fully that this holy book was dictated by the Lord Jehovah, so that He was present in it, to such an extent that He was the wisdom it contains. But the wisdom, which is the Lord Himself in it, lies hidden beneath the literal sense, and is not laid open except to those who possess the truths of doctrine and at the same time lead a good life, so that they are in the Lord and the Lord is in them. He ended his sermon with an earnest prayer, and then came down.<p>As the congregation was leaving, the angel asked the priest to say a few words of greeting to his ten companions. So he came over to them, and they talked together for half an hour. The priest spoke about the Divine Trinity, saying it was in Jesus Christ, in whom dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, as the Apostle Paul stated. Afterwards he spoke about the union of charity and faith, but what he said was the union of charity and truth, because faith is truth. </p>

751. When all had assembled, the priest ascended the pulpit and preached a sermon full of the spirit of wisdom. It was a sermon about the holiness of the Sacred Scripture, and about the conjunction of the Lord thereby with both the spiritual world and the natural world. In the state of enlightenment in which he was, he fully proved that that Holy Book was dictated by the Lord Jehovah, and that therefore He is in it, even so that He is the wisdom in it; but the wisdom which is Himself in the Word lies concealed under the sense of the letter, and is disclosed to those only who are both in the truths of doctrine and in goods of life; and who are thus in the Lord and the Lord in them. To the sermon he added an earnest prayer, and descended from the pulpit. <p>As the audience was leaving, the angel asked the priest to speak some words of peace to his ten companions; so he went to them, and they talked together for half an hour. He spoke of the Divine trinity as being in Jesus Christ in whom dwelleth all the fullness of Divinity bodily, according to the saying of the Apostle Paul; and he afterward spoke of the union of charity and faith, but he said the union of charity and truth because faith is truth. </p>

751. When the congregation had assembled, the priest ascended the pulpit and preached a sermon full of the spirit of wisdom. The subject was the sanctity of the Sacred Scripture, and the conjunction of the Lord with both worlds, the spiritual and the natural, by means of it. Enlightened as he then was, he fully proved that the Holy Book was dictated by Jehovah the Lord, and that consequently He is in it, so that He is the wisdom therein; but that the wisdom, which is Himself therein, lies concealed under the sense of the Letter, and is revealed to none but those who are in the truths of doctrine and at the same time in goodness of life, and who are thus in the Lord, and the Lord in them. When the sermon was concluded he offered up a prayer and came down from the pulpit.<p>As the congregation was going out, the angel requested the priest to speak a few words of peace to his ten companions; so he came to them and conversed with them for half an hour. He spoke on the Divine Trinity, saying that it is in Jesus Christ, in whom all the fullness of Divinity dwells bodily, according to the declaration of the apostle Paul. He then spoke on the union of charity and faith; but he used the words, "the union of charity and truth," because faith is truth. </p>

751. Postquam congregati sunt, ascendit Sacerdos pulpitum, et concionabatur sermonem plenum spiritu sapientiae: Concio erat de sanctitate Scripturae sacrae, et de conjunctione Domini cum utroque Mundo, Spirituali et Naturali, per illam; in illustratione, in qua erat, plene convicit, quod Sanctus ille Liber dictatus sit a Jehovah Domino, et quod inde Ipse sit in illo, adeo ut Ipse sit Sapientia ibi; sed quod Sapientia, quae est Ipse inibi, sub sensu literae jaceat recondita, et non aperiatur nisi illis, qui in veris doctrinae, et simul in bonis vitae sunt, et sic in Domino et Dominus in illis: Concioni subjunxit votivam orationem, et descendit. Exeuntibus auditoribus Angelus rogavit Sacerdotem, ut aliqua verba pacis cum decem suis comitibus loqueretur; et accessit ad illos, et colloquebantur per semissem horae, et loquebatur de Divina Trinitate, quod illa in Jesu Christo sit, in Quo Plenitudo omnis Divinitatis corporaliter habitat, secundum edictum Apostoli Pauli; et postea de Unione Charitatis et Fidei, sed dixit, de Unione Charitatis et Veritatis, quia Fides est Veritas. </p>
