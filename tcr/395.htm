<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>395</b>.我在接下来的部分（403－405）将证明，每个人自受造、因而自出生时起，就被赋予这三种爱。若安排得当，它们会使人日益完善，否则，就会使人日益败坏。现在仅说明：如果天堂之爱构成头，尘世之爱构成胸、腹，自我之爱构成脚和脚底，那么这三种爱就是井然有序的。我在前面数次提及，人的心智被划分为三层。人从最高层注目于神，从第二层或中间层注目于尘世，从第三层或最底层注目于自己。由于心智是如此构造的，所以它能因着注目于神和天堂而被提升或自我提升；也能因着注目于尘世及其自然界朝各个方向两边延伸或自我延伸；还能因着注目于地面和地狱而下沉或自行下沉。身体的视觉在这些方面则复制了心智的视觉，因为它也能仰视、环视和俯视。<br />人的心智就象通过楼梯相连的三层楼房。顶层住着天堂天人，中间层住着世人，底层住着恶灵。若人的这三种爱安排得当，他就能随意上上下下。当上到顶层时，便与天人相伴，如同其中的一员；当由此下到中间层时，便与世人相伴，如同天使般的人；当他再往下时，便与恶灵相伴，如同世俗之人，他教导、责备并驯服他们。<br />当人的这三种爱安排得当时，它们还会如此自我协调：最高层的爱，即天堂之爱，居于第二层的爱，即尘世之爱的内部，并经由这爱而居于第三层或最底层的爱，即自我之爱的内部。居于内部的爱还能随意支配居于外部的爱。所以，如果天堂之爱居于尘世之爱的内部，并经由这爱而居于自我之爱的内部，那么这人就会通过天堂之神在各层履行服务。这三种爱的功能就象意愿、理解力和行动。意愿作用于理解力，并在此为自己寻求使它产生行动的手段。在接下来的部分会看到有关该主题的更多内容，那里将会证明，这三种爱若安排得当，会使人日益完善，否则，会使人败坏和颠倒。</p>

<p>
395. 我將在下一部分(<a href="403.htm">403-405</a>)證明, 每個人從被造,因而從出生時起, 這三種愛都被賦予在人的裡面。倘若它們能被合理地安排時, 能使人變得更完全; 若非如此, 則會使人墮落。在此先提出:如果將對天國的愛置於頭部, 對世界的愛於胸腹部, 對自己的愛於腿腳部, 這三種愛便是按優先次序合理安排了。
<p>之前我曾多次提及(<a href="34.htm">34</a>, <a href="42.htm">42</a>, <a href="69.htm">69</a>, <a href="147.htm">147</a>, <a href="186.htm">186</a>, <a href="296.htm">296</a>), 人的思想被劃分為三個層級。最高的層級, 聚焦於上帝; 第二或中間的層級, 聚焦於世界; 第三或最底層級, 聚焦於自己。思想的如此構造, 所以能被提升或自我提升至聚焦上帝和天國的層次。也能向各個方向擴展或自我擴展到聚焦於世界及其中之物; 思想還能被降低或自行降低至聚焦於地上或地獄之物。在這些方面, 思想的視野能效仿身體的眼界, 能朝上,環視以及朝下看。
<p>[2]人的思想像樓梯相連的三層樓房。頂層住著天國來的天人, 中間層住著世上的人, 底層住著魔鬼。倘若一個人的三種愛按優先次序合理安排, 他便可隨意上上下下。當上到頂層時, 便與天人一道, 自己也像天人中的一員。當由此下到中間層時, 便與世人相處, 像個天人般的人。當他再往下時, 便像個世俗之人, 與惡靈處在一起, 去教導,訓斥與感化他們。
<p>[3]當這三種愛在一個人裡面被合理安排時, 它們還會如此協調合作:最高層的愛(對天國的愛), 呈現在第二層的愛(對世界的愛)之中, 並藉此呈現在第三層或最底層的愛(對自己的愛)之中。事實上, 在內之愛也完全控制在外之愛。因此, 如果對天國的愛在對世界的愛之中, 並藉此而在對自己的愛中, 這人便由天國之上帝啟示下在各個層次發揮用處。
<p>這三種愛的運行, 如同意志,認知與行動。意志作用於認知, 並在此尋求方法來產生行動。在下一部分(<a href="403.htm">403-405</a>)對此有更詳盡的說明:如果這三種愛合理安排, 則使人更加完全; 如果沒有被合理安排, 則使人墮落, 令人顛倒。 </p>

395. The next part of this discussion [403-405] will show that these three categories of love are in each one of us from creation and by birth; when they are prioritized in the right way they improve us, but when they are not prioritized in the right way they damage us. At present it is enough to mention that these three loves are prioritized in the right way when our love for heaven plays the part of the head; our love for the world, the part of the chest and abdomen; and our love for ourselves, the part of the lower legs and feet.
<p>As I have mentioned several times before [34, 42, 69, 147, 186, 296], the human mind is divided into three regions. From our highest region we focus on God; from our second or middle region we focus on the world; and from our third or lowest region we focus on ourselves. Because our mind has this structure, it can be lifted up or can lift itself up to focus on God and heaven; it can be spread out or spread itself out in every direction to focus on the world and its nature; and it can be lowered down or can lower itself down to focus on the earth and hell. In these respects physical sight emulates mental sight - physical sight too can look up, around, and down.
</p>
<p>
[2] The human mind is like a three-story house with stairs that provide transitions between levels. There are angels from heaven living on the top floor, people of the world on the middle floor, and demons on the bottom floor. People for whom these three categories of love have been prioritized in the right way can go up or down whenever they want. When they go up to the top floor, they are like angels among the angels there. When they go down to the middle floor, they are like angelic people with the people there. When they go even farther down, they are like worldly people with the demons there - they give the demons instructions, confront them, and tame them.
</p>
<p>
[3] When these three categories of love are properly prioritized in us, they are also coordinated in such a way that the highest love, our love for heaven, is present in the second love, our love for the world, and through that in the third or lowest love, our love for ourselves. In fact, the love that is inside steers the love that is outside wherever it wants. Therefore if a love for heaven is present in our love for the world and through that in our love for ourselves, with each type of love we accomplish useful things that are inspired by the God of heaven.
<p>In operation these three loves function like the will, the intellect, and action: the will flows into the intellect, where it finds the means of producing action. There will be more on these last points in the next part of the discussion [403-405], which shows that if these three loves are prioritized in the right way, they improve us, but if they are not prioritized in the right way, they damage us and turn us upside down. </p>

395. I shall prove in the next section [<a href="403.htm">403-405</a>] that every person is by creation and therefore from birth endowed with these three loves; and when they are properly ordered they increase a person's perfection, and when they are not, they corrupt him. For the moment it may be enough to remark that these three loves are properly ordered when the love of heaven makes up the head, the love of the world the chest and belly, and self-love the feet and soles of the feet. The human mind is divided into three levels, as I have said several times before; on the highest level a person looks towards God, on the second or middle level the world, and on the third or lowest level himself. Since the mind is like this, it can be raised or it can lift itself up, by looking to God and heaven; it can be spread or spread itself laterally in every direction, by looking to the world and nature in it; and it can sink or let itself down, by looking to the ground and to hell. In these respects the body's sight copies the mind's, for it too can look up, look around and look down.</p>
<p>
[2] The human mind is like a house with three floors communicating by staircases. On the top floor live angels from heaven, on the middle floor people in the world, and on the bottom floor genii <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
. If a person has those three loves properly ordered, he can at will go up or down. When he climbs to the top floor he is with the angels and like one himself; when he comes down from there to the middle floor, there he is with people, like a man-angel; and when he comes even further down, he is with genii like a person in the world, and he instructs, reproves and tames them.</p>
<p>
[3] When a person has those three loves properly ordered, they are also arranged among themselves so that the highest love, which is that of heaven, is inside the second, the love of the world, and by means of this in the third or lowest, which is self-love. The love which is inside also has complete control over the one which is outside. So if the love of heaven is inside the love of the world, and is by this means in self-love, then the person is guided by the God of heaven in the services he performs at each level. The three loves function like the will, the understanding and action. The will acts upon the understanding, and there seeks out means for itself which allow it to perform the action. But there will be more to be seen on this subject in the next section, where it will be proved that these three loves if properly ordered increase a person's perfection, and if not properly ordered, corrupt him and turn him upside down.<p>

395. That these three loves reside in every man from creation and therefore from birth, and that when rightly subordinated they perfect him, and when not, they pervert him, will be shown in the next article. It may serve for the present merely to state, that these three loves are rightly subordinated when the love of heaven forms the head, the love of the world the breast and abdomen, and the love of self the feet and their soles. As repeatedly stated above, the human mind is divided into three regions. From the highest region man looks to God, from the second or middle region to the world, and from the third or lowest to himself. The mind being such it can be raised and can raise itself upward, because to God and to heaven; it can be extended and can extend itself to the sides in all directions, because into the world and its nature; and it can be let downward and let itself downward, because to earth and to hell. In these respects the bodily vision emulates the mind's vision; it also can look upward, round about, and downward.
</p>
<p>
[2] The human mind is like a house of three stories which communicate by stairs, in the highest of which angels from heaven dwell, in the middle men in the world, and in the lowest one, genii. The man in whom these three loves are rightly subordinated can ascend and descend in this house at his pleasure; and when he ascends to the highest story, he is in company with angels as an angel; and when he descends from that to the middle story he is in company with men as an angel man; and when from this he descends still further, he is in company with genii as a man of the world, instructing, reproving, and subduing them.
</p>
<p>
[3] In the man in whom these three loves are rightly subordinated, they are also coordinated thus: The highest love, which is the love of heaven, is inwardly in the second, which is the love of the world, and through this in the third or lowest, which is the love of self; and the love that is within directs at its will that which is without. So when the love of heaven is inwardly in the love of the world, and through this in the love of self, man from the God of heaven, performs uses in each. In their operation these three loves are like will, understanding, and action; the will flows into the understanding, and there provides itself with the means whereby it produces action. But on these points more will be seen in the following article, where it will be shown that these three loves, when rightly subordinated, perfect man, but when not rightly subordinated, pervert and invert him. </p>

395. These three loves are in every man from creation, and therefore from birth, and they perfect him when kept in their proper order, but destroy him when not so regulated. This will be shown in the next article; but here it may be noted that these three loves are rightly subordinated when the love of heaven constitutes the head, the love of the world the breast and belly, and the love of self the feet and soles of the feet. The human mind, as has been frequently stated above, is divided into three regions, from the highest of which a man regards God, from the second or middle the world, and from the third or lowest himself. Since this is the nature of the mind, it can be raised, and can raise itself, upwards, because it can look towards God and heaven, it can be extended, and can extend itself on all sides, because it can look towards the world and nature of which the world forms a part; and it can be sent, and can send itself downwards, because it can look towards the earth and hell. In these respects bodily vision resembles mental vision, as it also can look upwards, around and downwards.</p>
<p>
[2] The human mind is like a house of three storeys which communicate with one another by stairways; angels of heaven dwell in the highest of these storeys, in the middle, men of the world, and in the lowest, evil spirits (genii). When these three loves are rightly subordinated, a man can ascend and descend at pleasure. When he ascends to the highest storey, he is in company with angels as an angel; when from this he goes down to the middle storey he is there in company with men as a man-angel; and when he descends from this still lower he is in company with evil spirits as a man of the world, and these he instructs, reproves and subdues.</p>
<p>
[3] When these three loves are duly subordinated they are also so co-ordinated that the highest love, the love of heaven, is inwardly within the second, the love of the world, and through this, within the third or lowest, the love of self; and the love which is within directs at its pleasure that which is without. Therefore, if the love of heaven is inwardly within the love of the world, and through this within the love of self, the man performs uses in the exercise of each of these loves, from the God of heaven. These three loves are in their operation like will, understanding and action; for the will enters by influx into the understanding, and there provides itself with means by which it proceeds to action. However, more will be seen concerning this in the following article, where it will be shown that these three loves, when they are rightly subordinated, perfect a man, but pervert and destroy him when they are not. </p>

395. Quod tres illi Amores sint in unoquovis homine a creatione et inde nativitate, et quod dum rite subordinati sunt, perficiant hominem, et dum non rite, pervertant illum, in sequente Articulo demonstrabitur; hic solum memorare licet, quod tres illi amores tunc rite subordinati sint, quando Amor Coeli facit caput, Amor mundi pectus et ventrem, et Amor sui pedes et plantas. Mens humana distincta est in tres regiones, ut supra aliquoties dictum est; homo e suprema regione spectat Deum, e secunda seu media Mundum, ac e tertia seu infima semetipsum; Mens quia talis est, potest elevari et se elevare sursum, quia ad Deum et Coelum, potest effundi et se effundere ad latera quaquaversum, quia in Mundum et ejus naturam, et potest demitti et se demittere deorsum, quia ad terram et ad infernum; in his visus corporis aemulatur visum mentis; ille quoque potest suspicere, circumspicere, et despicere.</p>
<p>
[2] Mens humana est sicut Domus trium mansionum, inter quas est communicatio per scalas, in quarum suprema habitant Angeli e Coelo, in media homines e Mundo, et in infima genii; homo, in quo tres illi amores rite subordinati sunt, potest ex placito ascendere et descendere, et cum in supremam mansionem ascendit, una est cum Angelis sicut Angelus, et cum inde descendit in mediam, est ibi una cum hominibus sicut homo Angelus, et cum ex hac ulterius descendit, est una cum geniis sicut homo mundi, et illos instruit, arguit, et domat.</p>
<p>
[3] In homine, in quo tres illi Amores rite subordinati sunt, etiam coordinati sunt ita, quod supremus Amor, qui est amor coeli, sit intus in secundo, qui est amor mundi, et per hunc in tertio seu infimo, qui est amor sui, et amor qui intus est, is etiam dirigit illum qui extra est ad suum nutum; quare si amor Coeli est intus in amore Mundi, et per hunc in amore sui, homo agit usus in unoquovis a Deo Coeli. Sunt illi tres amores in operando, sicut Voluntas, Intellectus et Actio; Voluntas influit in Intellectum, et ibi prospicit sibi media, per quae producit actionem. Sed de his videbuntur plura in sequente Articulo, ubi demonstrabitur, Quod tres illi Amores, si rite subordinati sunt, perficiant hominem, at si non rite subordinati sunt, pervertant et invertant illum. </p>
