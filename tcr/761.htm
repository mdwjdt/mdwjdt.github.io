<p>
761. As for the Christian church's final hour being the same kind of night in which the former churches came to an end, this is made clear by what the Lord foretold about the Christian church in the Gospels and in Daniel.
<p>In the Gospels it is clear from this statement:
<p>They will see the abomination of desolation. Then there will be a great affliction such as has never existed since the world began until now and will never exist again. In fact, unless those days were cut short no flesh would be saved. At the end, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven. (<a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21-22</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">29</a>)
<p>This time is also called night elsewhere in the Gospels; for example, in Luke: "During that night, two will be upon one bed. One will be taken; the other will be left" (<a href="3927/luke_17_34.htm">Luke 17:34</a>). Also in John, "I have to do the work of the one who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work" (<a href="3927/john_9_4.htm">John 9:4</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] Since all light departs in the middle of the night, and the Lord is the true light (<a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">John 1:4</a>; ; , ), he said to his disciples as he rose up into heaven, "I am with you even until the close of the age" (<a href="3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). After that he leaves them and goes to the new church.
<p>Daniel, too, shows that the Christian church's final hour is the same kind of night in which the former churches came to an end:
<p>In the end desolation [will fly in] on a bird of abominations; even to the close and the cutting down, it will drip steadily upon the devastation. (<a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>)
<p>The fact that this was a prediction of the end of the Christian church is made clear by the Lord's words in <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>. It is also clear from Daniel's words about the fourth kingdom or the fourth church as depicted in Nebuchadnezzar's statue:
<p>As you saw iron mixed with muddy clay, they will mingle with the seed of humankind, but the two will not stick together, just as iron and clay do not stick together. (<a href="3927/daniel_2_43.htm">Daniel 2:43</a>)
<p>The seed of humankind means truth from the Word.
</p>
<p>
[3] The same thing is also clear from the fourth church that was represented as the fourth beast to rise up from the sea:
<p>I saw visions in the night; behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, will devour the entire earth, trample it, and break it to pieces. (<a href="3927/daniel_7_7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_23.htm">23</a>)
<p>These expressions mean that all the truth in the church is going to come to an end. Then there will be night, because truth is what provides daylight to the church.
<p>Many similar prophecies regarding the Christian church occur in the Book of Revelation, especially in chapter 16, where we read about the bowls of God's anger that are poured out on the earth; these symbolize false teachings that will then flood the church and destroy it.
<p>There are many similar passages in the prophets. For example, "Isn't the day of Jehovah a day of darkness and not light, a day of thick darkness and no brightness?" (<a href="3927/amos_5_18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>, <a href="3927/amos_5_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>). "In that day, Jehovah will look down on the land, and behold, darkness; and the light will grow dark over its ruins" (<a href="3927/isaiah_5_30.htm">Isaiah 5:30</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_8_22.htm">8:22</a>). The day of Jehovah means the day of the Coming of the Lord. </p>

<p>
761. The final period of the Christian church is absolute night, in which the previous churches ended, as can be established from the Lord's prediction about it in the Gospels and in Daniel. A passage from the Gospels states that they would see the abomination of desolation, and there would be great affliction such as had not been since the beginning of the world up to now, and would not be in the future; and that unless those days were shortened, no flesh could be saved; and finally the sun would be darkened, the moon would not give its light, and the stars would fall from the sky (<a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21-22</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">29</a>). This period is also called night elsewhere in the Gospels, as in Luke:<p>On that night there will be two in one bed; one will be received, the other left behind, <a href="3927/luke_17_34.htm">Luke 17:34</a>.<p>And in John:<p>I must do the work of Him that sent me. The night will come, when no one will be able to work, <a href="3927/john_9_4.htm">John 9:4</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] Since all light departs in the middle of the night, and the Lord is the true light (<a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">John 1:4</a>ff; <a href="3927/john_8_12.htm">John 8:12</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">12:35-36</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>), He said to the disciples when He went up into heaven:<p>I am with you until the ending of the age, <a href="3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>.<p>Then He leaves them for the new church. There is further proof in Daniel for this final period of the church being absolute night, in which the previous churches ended, in this passage:<p>Finally upon the bird of abominations desolation, to the point of ending and cutting off; it shall be poured drop by drop upon devastation, <a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>.<p>It is clear from the Lord's words in <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a> that this is a prediction of the end of the Christian church. It is also clear from this passage of Daniel about the fourth kingdom, that is, the fourth church, represented by the statue Nebuchadnezzar saw:<p>As you saw iron mixed with common clay, so will people intermingle by means of human seed; but they will not hold together, one with another, just as iron does not with clay, <a href="3927/daniel_2_43.htm">Daniel 2:43</a>.<p>Human seed there is the truth of the Word.</p>
<p>
[3] It is also clear from this passage about the fourth church represented by the fourth beast coming up out of the sea:<p>I saw in visions of the night, and there was the fourth beast, dreadful and frightening; it will devour the whole earth and trample it and crush it, <a href="3927/daniel_7_7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_23.htm">23</a>.<p>This means that it would put an end to all the truth of the church. Then it would be night, because the truth of the church is light. There are many similar predictions about this church in Revelation, especially chapter 16, where it speaks of the bowls of God's wrath being poured out upon the earth. These mean the falsities which will then swamp and destroy the church. There are many similar passages in the Prophets, as for example:<p>Is not the day of Jehovah darkness and not light, thick darkness and no brilliance? <a href="3927/amos_5_18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>, <a href="3927/amos_5_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>.<p>Also:<p>On that day Jehovah will look down on the earth, and behold, darkness, and the light will become dim in its ruins, <a href="3927/isaiah_5_30.htm">Isaiah 5:30</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_8_22.htm">8:22</a>.<p>The day of Jehovah is that of the Lord's coming. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #761 (Ager, 1970)

<p>
761. That the last time of the Christian church was the very night in which the former churches came to an end, can be seen from the Lord's prediction respecting it in the Gospels and in Daniel; in the Gospels from the following: <p>That they would see the abomination of desolation, and there would be great tribulation, such as had not been from the beginning of the world until then, nor ever would be; and except those days should be shortened no flesh would be saved; and finally the sun shall be darkened, the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven (<a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21-22,</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">29</a>). <p>That time is also called night elsewhere in the Gospels, as in Luke: <p>In that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken and the other left (<a href="3927/luke_17_34.htm">17:34</a>). <p>And in John: <p>I must work the works of Him that sent Me, the night cometh when no man can work (<a href="3927/john_9_4.htm">9:4</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] As at midnight all light departs, and the Lord is the true light (<a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">John 1:4-9</a>; <a href="3927/john_8_12.htm">8:12</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">12:35, 36</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>), so when the Lord ascended to heaven He said to His disciples: <p>Lo, I am with you always, even unto the consummation of the age (Matt.<a href="3927/matthew_28_20.htm">28:20</a>); <p>and then it is that He departs from them to a new church. That this last time of the church is the very night in which the former churches have come to an end can be seen also from the following passages in Daniel: <p>At last upon the bird of abomination shall be desolation and even to the consummation and decision shall it drop upon the devastation (<a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">9:27</a>). <p>That this is a prediction respecting the end of the Christian church is clearly evident from the Lord's words in Matthew (<a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">24:15</a>); as also from what is said in Daniel respecting the fourth kingdom, or the fourth church, represented by Nebuchadnezzar's statue: <p>Whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of man; but they shall not cohere one with the other even as iron doth not mingle with clay (Dan. <a href="3927/daniel_2_43.htm">2:43</a>), <p>"the seed of man" meaning the truth of the Word.
</p>
<p>
[3] And again, from what is said respecting the fourth church represented by the fourth beast coming up out of the sea: <p>I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible; it shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces (<a href="3927/daniel_7_7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_23.htm">23</a>). <p>This means that all the truth of the church will be consummated, and then it will be night, because the truth of the church is light. Respecting this church there are many other like predictions in the Apocalypse, especially in the sixteenth chapter which treats of the vials full of the wrath of God poured out upon the earth, these vials signifying the falsities that would then inundate and destroy the church. So likewise in many places in the Prophets, as in the following: <p>Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness and not light? even thick darkness and no brightness? (<a href="3927/amos_5_18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>, <a href="3927/amos_5_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>). <p>Again: <p>In that day Jehovah shall look down upon the land, and behold darkness, and the light is darkened in the ruins thereof (<a href="3927/isaiah_5_30.htm">Isaiah 5:30</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_8_22.htm">8:22</a>), <p>"the day of Jehovah" meaning the day of the Lord's coming. </p>

<p>
761. The last phase of the Christian Church is night itself, in which the former Churches came to an end, as is evident from the Lord's prediction concerning it in the Evangelists and in Daniel. In the Evangelists it is evident from these words:<p>They should see the abomination of desolation; and there should be great affliction, such as has not been since the beginning of the world to that time, nor should be; and except those days should be shortened no flesh could be saved; and lastly, "The sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven" <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21-22</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">29</a>.<p>In other passages in the Evangelists, that time is also called night, as in Luke:<p>"In that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and other shall be left," <a href="3927/luke_17_34.htm">17:34</a>;<p>and in John:<p>"I must work the works of Him that sent me... the night cometh, when no men can work" <a href="3927/john_9_4.htm">9:4</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] Since all light departs at midnight, and the Lord is the true light, <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">1:4</a>, and following verses; <a href="3927/john_8_12.htm">8:12</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">12:35-36</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>, therefore, He said to His disciples, when He ascended into heaven,<p>"I am with you... even unto the consummation of the age (A.V., the end of the world)," <a href="3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>;<p>and then He departs from them to a new Church. This last phase of the Church is night itself, in which the former Churches came to an end, as is evident also from these words in Daniel:<p>"At length upon the bird of abominations shall be desolation; and even to consummation and decision it shall drop upon the devastation (A.V., for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate)" <a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">9:27</a>.<p>This prophecy relates to the end of the Christian Church, as is clearly evident from the Lord's words, <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>; and from these words in Daniel concerning the fourth kingdom or the fourth Church, represented by the image which Nebuchadnezzar saw:<p>"And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay" <a href="3927/daniel_2_43.htm">Daniel 2:43</a>.<p>The seed of man is the truth of the Word.</p>
<p>
[3] It is also evident from these words concerning the fourth Church, represented by the fourth beast ascending out of the sea:<p>"I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible... it shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces" <a href="3927/daniel_7_7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_23.htm">23</a>.<p>This means that it will consummate every truth of the Church; and then there will be night, because the truth of the Church is light. Many similar things are predicted of this Church in the Revelation, especially in the sixteenth chapter, where it speaks of the vials of the wrath of God poured out upon the earth, signifying the falsities which should then overflow and destroy the Church. There are also similar passages in the Prophets to the same effect; as for example:<p>"Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?" <a href="3927/amos_5_18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>, <a href="3927/amos_5_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>;<p>and again,<p>"In that day... Jehovah will look down upon the earth, and, behold, it is darkness, and the light shall become dark in its ruins (A.V., if one look unto the land, behold darkness... and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof)" <a href="3927/isaiah_5_30.htm">Isaiah 5:30</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_8_22.htm">8:22</a>.<p>The day of Jehovah is the day of the Lord's Coming. </p>

761. Quod ultimum tempus Ecclesiae Christianae, sit ipsa Nox, in quam desierunt priores, constat ex Domini Praedictione de illa apud Evangelistas et apud Danielem; apud Evangelistas ex his, "Quod visuri sint Abominationem desolationis, et quod futura sit afflictio magna, qualis non fuit ab initio Mundi, usque nunc, nec fiet: et quod nisi abbreviarentur dies illi, nulla caro salvari posset: et denique, Sol obscurabitur, Luna non dabit lumen suum, et Stellae cadent de Coelo," <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthaeus 24:15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21-22</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">29</a>. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Illud tempus vocatur Nox etiam alibi apud Evangelistas, ut apud Lucam, "In Nocte illa erunt duo super lecto uno; unus acceptabitur, alter vero deseretur," <a href="3927/luke_17_34.htm">Luca 17:34</a> et apud Johannem, Me oportet operari opera Ipsius qui misit Me; veniet Nox, quando nemo poterit operari, <a href="3927/john_9_4.htm">Johannes 9:4</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] Quoniam omnis Lux in media nocte abit, et Dominus est vera Lux, <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">Johannes 1:4</a>. seq., <a href="3927/john_8_12.htm">Johannes 8:12</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">12:35-36</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>; ideo ad Discipulos, cum ascendit in Coelum, dixit, Ego vobiscum sum usque ad Consummationem saeculi, <a href="3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthaeus 28:20</a>, et tunc ab illis ad Novam Ecclesiam abit. Quod ultimum hoc tempus Ecclesiae sit ipsa Nox, in quam desierunt Ecclesiae priores, constat etiam apud Danielem ex his, Tandem super avem abominationum Desolatio, et usque ad Consummationem et Decisum stillabit super Devastationem, <a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">9:27</a>, quod hoc de Ecclesiae Christianae fine praedictum sit, patet clare a Domini verbis, <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthaeus 24:15</a>: <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
tum ex his apud Danielem de quarto Regno seu de quarta Ecclesia repraesentata per statuam Nebuchadnezaris, "Quod vidisti ferrum mixtum cum argilla luti, commiscebunt se per semen hominis, sed non cohaerebunt unum cum altero, quemadmodum ferrum non cum argilla," <a href="3927/daniel_2_43.htm">2:43</a>semen hominis est verum Verbi.</p>
<p>
[3] Et quoque ex his de quarta Ecclesia repraesentata per quartam Bestiam ascendentem ex mari, "Videns fui in visionibus noctis, et ecce Bestia quarta, terribilis et formidabilis, comedet universam terram, et conculcabit eam, et conteret eam," <a href="3927/daniel_7_7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_23.htm">23</a>, per quae intelligitur, quod consummatura sit omne verum Ecclesiae; et tunc erit Nox, quia verum Ecclesiae est lux. Similia de hac Ecclesia praedicuntur plura in Apocalypsi, imprimis <a href="3927/revelation_16_1.htm">16</a>, ubi agitur de phialis irae Dei, effusis in terram, per quas significantur falsitates, quae tunc Ecclesiam inundabunt et perdent. Similiter multis in locis apud Prophetas, ut in his, "Nonne tenebrae dies Jehovae et non lux, caligo et non splendor, <a href="3927/amos_5_18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>, <a href="3927/amos_5_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_15.htm">Zephanias 1:15</a>, tum, In die illo despiciet Jehovah in terram, quae ecce tenebrae, et lux obtenebrescet in ruinis suis," <a href="3927/isaiah_5_30.htm">Esaias 5:30</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_8_22.htm">8:22</a> dies Jehovae est dies adventus Domini.<p>
