<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>2</b>.新天堂与新教会的普遍信仰如下：永恒之主耶和华，降世征服地狱，并荣耀祂的人身；若非如此，无人能得救；信祂的人得救。上述内容就是该信仰的普遍形式，因为这是信仰的普遍原则，信仰的普遍原则必包含在其一切细节中。<br />这是一个信仰的普遍原则：神在本质和位格上是一，圣三一在祂里面，祂就是主神救主耶稣基督。<br />这是一个信仰的普遍原则：若非主降世，无人得救。<br />这是一个信仰的普遍原则：主降世将地狱从人那里移除，祂通过与之争战并战胜它而移除，从而将其制服，使之归入秩序、服从祂的命令。这是一个信仰的普遍原则：主降世荣耀了祂在世所取的人性，也就是说，将这人性与神性（万物起源于它）合一，并由此永远使地狱保持秩序并服从祂的命令。由于这一切只能通过以其人性所经历的各种试探，甚至终极的试探，也就是十字架受难而成就，所以祂忍受了这一切。<br />这些信仰的普遍原则是关于主的。在人这一方，信仰的普遍原则是：人当信主，因为通过信主，人得以与主结合，从而得救。信主就是笃信主是救主；由于只有那些过着良善生活之人才有如此信心，所以这也是信祂之义。对此，主在约翰福音中教导：<br />父的意思是叫一切见子而信的人得永生。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.40.htm">约翰福音6:40</a>）<br /><br />信子的有永生。不信子的不得见永生；神的震怒常在他身上（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.36.htm">约翰福音3:36</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #2 </h4>
<p>
2. 新天國與新教會的信仰, 就總體而言, 概述如下:
<p>永恆之主耶和華, 降臨人間征服地獄, 並榮耀祂的人身; 若非如此, 無人能被拯救; 信祂的人得拯救。
<p>以上被稱為該信仰的總體形式, 是信仰的普遍原則。信仰的普遍原則必存於信仰的整體和細節之中。上帝的本質和位格是一, 聖三一集於這一, 這一就是主耶穌基督, 這是信仰的一個普遍原則。若非主降臨人間, 則無人得救, 這是信仰的一個普遍原則。主降臨人間(那時地獄勢力侵犯人間), 藉著與地獄爭戰並戰勝制服它, 從而移除地獄, 使其歸入秩序並服從於祂, 這是信仰的一個普遍原則。主降臨人間, 榮耀祂在人間所取之人, 就是將這人與神性聯合, 從而永遠地保持地獄歸入秩序並服從於祂; 這樣的聯合唯有藉著祂所取之人被准許接受各樣的試探而得以成就, 甚至最後接受終極的試探——十字架受難, 祂忍受並得勝了; 這是信仰的一個普遍原則。這些是關於主這方面信仰的幾個普遍原則。
<p>關於我們人這方面:
<p>人應當信主, 因為通過信主, 人得以與主聯合, 從而被得拯救。信主就是篤信主施行拯救; 因為唯有那些過良善生活者方有如此信心, 因而這也是信祂之意。主在約翰福音中教導:父的意思是叫一切見子而信的人得永生(<a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">約翰福音6:40</a>)。在另一處:信子的有永生。不信子的不得見永生; 上帝的震怒常在他身上(<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">約翰福音3:36</a>)。 </p>

2. The faith of the new heaven and the new church in universal form is this: The Lord from eternity, who is Jehovah, came into the world to gain control over the hells and to glorify his own human nature. If he had not done this, not one mortal could have been saved; those who believe in him are saved.
</p>
<p>
[2] I say in universal form because this concept is universal to the faith and something universal to the faith is going to be present in each and every aspect of it. It is universal to the faith to believe that God is one in essence and in person, to believe that in God there is a divine Trinity, and to believe that the Lord God the Savior Jesus Christ is God. It is universal to the faith to believe that if the Lord had not come into the world not one mortal could have been saved. It is universal to the faith to believe that the Lord came into the world to separate hell from the human race, and that he accomplished this by repeatedly doing battle with hell and conquering it. In this way he gained control over it, forced it back into the divine design, and made it obey him. It is universal to the faith to believe that he came into the world to glorify the human nature he took on in the world, that is, to unite it to its divine source. This is how he keeps hell eternally in its place and in obedience to himself. Since this could not have been accomplished except by allowing his human nature to be tested, including even the ultimate test, the suffering on the cross, therefore he underwent that experience. These are universal points of faith regarding the Lord.
</p>
<p>
[3] For our part, it is universal to the faith that we believe in the Lord, for our believing in him gives us a partnership with him, and through this partnership comes salvation. To believe in him is to have confidence that he saves; and because only those who live good lives can have such confidence, this too is meant by believing in him. In fact, the Lord says in John: "This is the will of the Father, that everyone who believes in the Son has eternal life" (<a href="3927/john_6_39.htm">John 6:39-40</a>). And in another passage, "Those who believe in the Son have eternal life. But those who do not believe the Son will not see life; instead the anger of God remains on them" (<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>). </p>

2. THE FAITH OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW CHURCH IS IN UNIVERSAL TERMS AS FOLLOWS. <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
<p>The Lord from eternity, who is Jehovah, came into the world to subdue the hells and to glorify His Human. Without this no mortal could have been saved, and those are saved who believe in Him.</p>
<p>
[2] The expression 'in universal terms' is used because this is a universal point of faith, and a universal point of faith must be contained in all its particulars. It is a universal point of faith that God is one in essence and in person, in whom is the Divine Trinity, and that He is the Lord God the Saviour Jesus Christ. It is a universal point of faith that no mortal could have been saved, if the Lord had not come into the world. It is a universal point of faith that He came into the world to take hell away from men, and He did this by fighting against hell and winning victories over it. In this way He subdued it and reduced it to order, and made it subject to His command. It is a universal point of faith that He came into the world to glorify the Human which He assumed in the world, that is, to unite it with the originating Divinity. By this means He keeps hell for ever in order and subject to His command. Since this could only be achieved by means of temptations experienced in His Human, even to the most extreme, His passion on the cross, He underwent this. These are the universal matters of faith concerning the Lord.</p>
<p>
[3] It is a universal point of faith on the part of man to believe in the Lord; for this belief links him to the Lord, and this is the way to salvation. Believing in Him means having confidence that He is the Saviour; and since only those who lead good lives can have such confidence, this too is meant by believing in Him. The Lord says this in John's gospel:<p>This is the will of the Father, that everyone who believes in the Son should have everlasting life, <a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>.<p>and elsewhere:<p>He who believes in the Son has everlasting life. He who does not believe in the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God rests upon him, <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>.<p>

2. THE FAITH OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND OF THE NEW CHURCH IN ITS UNIVERSAL FORM is as follows: <p>The Lord from eternity, who is Jehovah, came into the world to subjugate the hells and to glorify His Human; and without this no mortal could have been saved; and those are saved who believe in Him.
</p>
<p>
[2] This is called the faith in its universal form, because this is the universal principle of faith; and the universal principle of faith must be in each thing and in all things of it. It is a universal principle of faith that God is one in essence and in person, in whom is a Divine trinity, and that He is the Lord God the Savior Jesus Christ. It is a universal principle of faith that no mortal could have been saved unless the Lord had come into the world. It is a universal principle of faith that He came into the world to remove hell from man, and that He did remove it by means of contests with it and victories over it, and thereby He subdued it and reduced it to order and made it obedient to Himself. It is a universal principle of faith that He came into the world to glorify His Human which He took on in the world, that is, to unite it with the Divine from which [are all things], and thereby He eternally holds hell in order and under obedience to Himself. As this could be accomplished only by means of temptations admitted into His Human, even to the last of them, which was the passion of the cross, He endured even that. These are the universal principles of faith relating to the Lord.
</p>
<p>
[3] The universal principle of faith on man's part is that he should believe in the Lord; for by believing in Him there is conjunction with Him and thereby salvation. To believe in the Lord is to have confidence that He saves; and as only those who live rightly can have this confidence, this, too, is meant by believing in Him. And this the Lord teaches in John: <p>This is the Father's will, that everyone that believeth in the Son may have eternal life (<a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>); <p>and again: <p>He that believeth in the Son hath eternal life; but he that believeth not in the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him (<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>). </p>

2. The Faith of the New Heaven and the New Church, in its General Form, is this: The Lord from eternity, who is Jehovah, came into the world that He might subdue the hells and glorify His Human; without this no man could have been saved; and those are saved who believe on Him. <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
</p>
<p>
[2] This is said to be the general form of the faith, and faith in its general form enters into all its particulars. It is a general article of faith that God is one in Essence and in Person, in whom is the Divine Trinity, and that He is the Lord God the Savior Jesus Christ. It is a general article of faith that no man could have been saved unless the Lord had come into the world. It is a general article of faith that He came into the world in order to remove hell from man, which He accomplished by victory in combats against it. He thus subdued it, and reduced it to a state of order and obedience to Himself. It is a general article of faith that He came into the world to glorify His Human, which He assumed in the world; that is, to unite it with the Divine, from whom it came. By this means He keeps hell in order and under obedience to Himself for ever. Since this could not have been done unless He had permitted temptations to assail His Human, even the most extreme - the passion of the Cross, therefore that also He endured. These are the general articles of faith concerning the Lord.</p>
<p>
[3] The general form of faith on the part of man is that the should believe on the Lord; for belief on Him brings about conjunction with Him, and consequently salvation. To believe on Him is to have confidence that he saves; and since no one can have this confidence except the man who lives a good life, therefore this also is understood by believing on Him. This the Lord says in John:<p>"This is the will of the Father, that every one that believeth on the Son may have eternal life" <a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">6:40</a>.<p>An in another place:<p>"He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him" <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">3:36</a>.<p>

2. FIDES NOVI COELI ET NOVAE ECCLESIAE IN UNIVERSALI FORMA, haec est: <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Quod Dominus ab aeterno, Qui est JEHOVAH, in Mundum venerit, ut subjugaret Inferna, et glorificaret Humanum suum; et quod absque eo nemo mortalium salvari potuerit; et quod salventur qui credunt in Ipsum.</p>
<p>
[2] Dicitur in Universali forma, quia hoc est Universale fidei, ac Universale fidei est, quod in omnibus et singulis erit. Universale fidei est, quod Deus sit Unus Essentia et Persona, in Quo est Divina Trinitas, et quod Dominus Deus Salvator Jesus Christus sit Ille. Universale fidei est quod nullus mortalium salvari potuerit, nisi Dominus in Mundum venerit. Universale fidei est, quod in Mundum venerit, ut removeret Infernum ab homine, et quod removerit illud per pugnas contra illud, et per victorias super illud; ita subjugavit illud, et redegit illud in ordinem, et sub suam obedientiam. Universale fidei est, quod in Mundum venerit, ut Humanum suum, quod in Mundo suscepit, glorificaret, hoc est, uniret Divino a Quo; sic Infernum in ordine et sub obedientia sua, in aeternum tenet. Quoniam hoc non potuit fieri, quam per Tentationes in Humanum suum admissas usque ad Ultimam illarum, et ultima illarum fuit Passio crucis, ideo illam subivit. Haec sunt Universalia fidei de Domino.</p>
<p>
[3] Universale fidei a parte hominis est, ut credat in Dominum, nam per credere in Illum fit conjunctio cum Illo, per quam Salvatio: credere in Illum, est fiduciam habere quod Ille salvet; et quia fiduciam habere non potest, nisi qui bene vivit, ideo etiam hoc per credere in Ipsum intelligitur. Hoc dicit etiam Dominus apud Johannem, "Haec est voluntas Patris, ut omnis qui credit in Filium, habeat vitam aeternam," <a href="3927/john_6_39.htm">Johannes 6:39-40</a>. <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
Et alibi, "Qui credit in Filium, habet vitam aeternam: qui vero non credit Filio, non videbit vitam, sed ira Dei manet super illo," <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">3:36</a>. <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
