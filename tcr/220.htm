<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>220</b>.（4）诸如包含在圣言字义中的最外层的真理与良善由会幕的帘子、幔子和柱子来代表。摩西在旷野所建的会幕代表天堂和教会，因此耶和华在西乃山上指示了它的样式。结果，那会幕里面的所有东西，即烛台、金香炉、放陈设饼的桌子等，都代表和表示天堂和教会的圣物。存放约柜的至圣所代表、因而表示天堂和教会的至内层。刻在两块石版上的律法本身表示圣言，约柜上的基路伯表示保护圣言的圣物免遭亵渎的守卫者。由于外在的本质源于内在，外在的本质和内在的本质则源于至内在，就是此处的律法，故属于会幕的一切事物都代表并表示圣言的圣物。由此可知，会幕的最外在部分，即它的帘子、幔子和柱子，作为遮盖物、容器和支撑，就表示圣言最外在的事物，就是圣言字义上的真理与良善。正因这就是它们的含义，故所有帘子和幔子都要用捻的细麻和蓝色、紫色、朱红色线制造，并绣上基路伯（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.1.htm">出埃及记26:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.31.htm">31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.36.htm">36</a>）。我在《天堂的奥秘》一书解读出埃及记那一章的地方，解释了会幕及其一切事物分别代表和表示什么，无论总体还是细节。那里说明，帘子和幔子代表天堂与教会的外在，因而也代表圣言的外在；细麻表示从属灵源头而来的真理；“蓝色”表示从属天源头而来的真理；“紫色”表示属天的良善；“朱红色”表示属灵的良善；“基路伯”表示对圣言内在的保护。</p>

220. (4)真理與良善的外在, 正如聖言文字意義所包含的, 由會幕的簾,幔和柱來代表。
<p>由摩西在曠野所建的會幕代表著天國和教會, 因此其樣式由耶和華在西乃山上向摩西說明。結果, 在那會幕中的一切物件, 也就是燈檯,金香爐,陳設餅台等, 代表著天國和教會的神聖之物。擺放約櫃的至聖所, 代表著天國和教會的至內在部分。寫在兩塊石版上的律法則代表聖言。約櫃之上的基路伯表示護衛者, 保護聖言之神聖免遭褻瀆。於是, 因為外在之物的本質源自內在, 外在與外在之本質源自於至內在, 就是在約櫃之中的律法。因此, 屬於會幕的一切事物都代表與預示聖言的神聖事物。由此可知, 簾,幔和柱等會幕的外在部分, 會幕的遮蓋,容器,支撐, 表示聖言的外在事物, 就是聖言文字意義上的真理和良善。因此這樣說:這些幔子和門簾要用撚的細麻和藍色紫色朱紅色線製造, 並繡上基路伯(<a href="3927/exodus_26_1.htm">出埃及記26:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_36.htm">36</a>)。
<p>本章所論到的, 關於會幕及其中一切事物所代表的, 無論是總體, 還是細節, 都在『屬天的奧秘』一書中有詳述。在那裡說到的幔和簾代表天國和教會的外在部分, 因而也代表聖言的外在。"麻"表示從屬靈源頭來的真理。"藍色"表示從屬天源頭來的真理; "紫色"表示屬天的良善; "朱紅色"表示屬靈的良善; "基路伯"表示對聖言內在意義的護衛。 </p>

220. 4. The curtains, veils, and pillars in the tabernacle represented the types of good and truth that exist in the Word's literal meaning. The tabernacle that Moses built in the desert represented heaven and the church, which is why Jehovah revealed the form of it on Mount Sinai. All the objects inside the tabernacle - the lampstand, the golden incense altar, and the table for showbread - represented and meant what is holy in heaven and the church. The most holy place, which contained the ark of the covenant, represented and therefore meant the inmost aspect of heaven and the church. The law written on two tablets meant the Word. The angel guardians above it meant safeguards to prevent violation of the Word's holiness.
<p>Since outer things derive their essence from inner things, and outer and inner things together derive their essence from what is inmost, which in this case was the law, therefore all aspects of the tabernacle represented and meant the holy things in the Word.
<p>It follows from this that the outermost features of the tabernacle - the curtains, veils, and pillars that were coverings, containers, and structural supports - meant the outermost aspects of the Word, which are the forms of truth and goodness in its literal meaning. Because this was their meaning, all the curtains and veils were made of cotton interwoven with blue and purple threads, and with double-dyed scarlet threads, depicting angel guardians (<a href="3927/exodus_26_1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_36.htm">36</a>).
<p>Where Secrets of Heaven deals with this chapter in Exodus [<a href="swedenborg_arcana-coelestia-elliott_9592.htm">Secrets of Heaven 9592-9692</a>], I have explained both generally and specifically what the tabernacle and its contents represented and meant. There I have shown that the curtains and veils represented outer aspects of heaven and the church, and therefore outer aspects of the Word as well. The cotton or linen meant truth from a spiritual origin. The blue threads meant truth from a heavenly origin. The purple threads meant heavenly goodness. The double-dyed cloth meant spiritual goodness. Angel guardians meant protection of the inner aspects of the Word. </p>

220. (iv) TRUTHS AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF GOOD IN THEIR OUTERMOST FORMS, OF THE SORT FOUND IN THE LITERAL SENSE OF THE WORD, WERE REPRESENTED BY THE CURTAINS, VEILS AND POSTS OF THE TABERNACLE.<p>The tabernacle constructed by Moses in the desert was a representation of heaven and the church. That is why its description was revealed by Jehovah on Mount Sinai. Thus all its contents, the lampstand, the golden altar for incense and the table holding the bread of the Presence, represented and stood for the holy things of heaven and the church. The holy of holies, where the Ark of the Covenant stood, represented and so stood for the inmost of heaven and the church. The Law itself inscribed upon two tables stood for the Word, and the cherubim above it meant protection to prevent the holiness of the Word being violated.<p>Now since externals derive their essence from internals, and both of these derive theirs from the inmost, which in this case was the Law, therefore all the details of the tabernacle represented and stood for the holy things of the Word. Hence it follows that the outermost parts of the tabernacle, the curtains, veils and posts which covered, contained and supported it, meant the outermost form of the Word, which is the truths and forms of good contained in its literal sense. It was because that was their meaning that all the curtains and veils were made of lawn interwoven and violet and purple, and double-dyed red, with cherubim (<a href="3927/exodus_26_1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_36.htm">36</a>). I explained in ARCANA CAELESTIA in the commentary on that chapter of Exodus the general and the specific representations and meanings of the tabernacle and all its contents. It was there shown that the curtains and veils represented the externals of heaven and the church, so also those of the Word; and that lawn or fine linen meant truth of spiritual origin, violet truth of celestial origin, purple celestial good, double-dyed red spiritual good, and the cherubim the protection of the interiors of the Word. </p>

220. (4) Truths and goods in outmosts, such as are contained in the sense of the letter of the Word, were represented by the curtains, veils, and pillars of the tabernacle. The tabernacle built by Moses in the wilderness represented heaven and the church, and therefore the form of it was shown by Jehovah on Mount Sinai. As a consequence, all things in that tabernacle, namely, the candlestick, the golden altar for incense, and the table on which was the bread of faces, represented and signified the holy things of heaven and the church; the holy of holies, where the ark of the covenant was kept, represented and thus signified the inmost of heaven and the church; the law itself written upon the two tables signified the Word; and the cherubs above the ark signified guards to protect the holy things of the Word from desecration. Since, then, externals derive their essence from internals, and both externals and internals derive their essence from the inmost, which here was the law, so all things belonging to the tabernacle represented and signified the holy things of the Word. From this it follows that the outmost parts of the tabernacle, its curtains, veils, and pillars, which were coverings, containers, and supports, signified the outmost things of the Word, which are the truths and goods of the sense of its letter. Because this was what they signified: <p>All the curtains and veils were of fine-twined linen, and blue and purple and scarlet double-dyed, with cherubs (<a href="3927/exodus_26_1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_36.htm">36</a>). <p>What was represented and signified by the tabernacle and by all things in it, both in general and in particular, has been explained in Arcana Coelestia, where this chapter is treated of. It is there shown that the curtains and veils represented the externals of heaven and the church, and thus also the externals of the Word and that the "linen" [xylinum seu byssinum] signified truth from a spiritual origin; "blue" truth from a celestial origin; "purple" celestial good; "scarlet double-dyed" spiritual good; and the "cherubs" guards of the interiors of the Word. </p>

220. (4) TRUTHS AND GOODS IN ULTIMATES, SUCH AS ARE IN THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD, WERE REPRESENTED BY THE CURTAINS, VEILS AND PILLARS OF THE TABERNACLE.<p>The tabernacle which was built by Moses in the wilderness represented heaven and the Church; therefore the pattern of it was shown by Jehovah on Mount Sinai. Consequently everything that was in that tabernacle, as the lampstand, the golden altar for incense, and the table on which was the shewbread, represented and signified the holy things of heaven and the Church. The Holy of Holies, where was the Ark of the Covenant, represented and therefore signified the inmost of heaven and the Church. The Law itself, written on two tables, signified the Word; and the cherubim over it signified guards to prevent the violation of the holy things Of the Word. Now, because external things derive their essence from internal things, and both of these derive theirs from what is inmost, which in the tabernacle was the Law, therefore the holy things of the Word were represented and signified by all things belonging to the tabernacle. It follows, therefore, that the ultimates of the tabernacle, namely its curtains, veils and pillars, which were its coverings, containants and supports, signified the ultimates of the Word, which are the truths and goods of the sense of its Letter. Because such things were signified, therefore:<p>"all the curtains and veils were made of fine twined linen, of blue, and purple, and scarlet double-dyed, with cherubim" <a href="3927/exodus_26_1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_36.htm">36</a>.<p>What was represented and signified, in general and in particular, by the tabernacle and everything in it, is explained in the "Arcana Caelestia," where that chapter is treated of. It is there shown that the curtains and veils represented the external things of heaven and the Church, thus also the external things of the Word. Further, that fine linen signified truth from a spiritual origin; blue, truth from a celestial origin; purple, celestial good; scarlet double-dyed, spiritual good; and cherubim, the guards of the interiors of the Word. </p>

220. IV. QUOD VERA ET BONA IN ULTIMIS, QUALIA SUNT IN SENSU LITERAE VERBI, REPRAESENTATA SINT PER AULAEA, VELA, ET COLUMNAS TABERNACULI. Per tabernaculum per Mosen in deserto exstructum repraesentatum est Coelum et Ecclesia, quare forma ejus a Jehovah super monte Sinai ostensa est; inde per omnia, quae in Tabernaculo illo erant, quae erant Candelabrum, Altare aureum pro suffitu, et Mensa super qua Panes facierum, repraesentata et significata sunt Sancta Coeli et Ecclesiae; et per Sanctum sanctorum, ubi erat Arca foederis, repraesentatum et inde significatum est intimum Coeli et Ecclesiae; et per ipsam Legem inscriptam binis Tabulis, significatum est Verbum, perque Cherubos supra illam significatae sunt custodiae ne sancta Verbi violentur. Nunc quia Externa suam essentiam trahunt ab Internis, et haec et illa ab Intimo, quod ibi erat Lex, ideo Sancta Verbi per omnia Tabernaculi repraesentata et significata sunt; inde sequitur, quod per ultima Tabernaculi, quae erant Aulaea, Vela et Columnae, quae erant tegumenta, continentia, et firmamenta, significata sint ultima Verbi, quae sunt Vera et Bona Sensus literae ejus: quia illa significata sunt, ideo omnia Aulaea et Vela facta sunt ex xylino intertexto, et hyacinthino et purpura, et coccineo dibapho, cum Cherubis, <a href="3927/exodus_26_1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_36.htm">36</a>.
