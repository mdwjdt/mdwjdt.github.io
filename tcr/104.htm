<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>104</b>.（8）祂朝合一（union）的发展就是祂的倒空状态；合一本身则是祂的荣耀状态。在教会，众所周知，主在世时有两种状态，被称为倒空状态和荣耀状态。在先的状态，也就是倒空的状态，在圣言多处有所描述，特别在大卫诗篇和先知书，尤其在以赛亚书（赛#53章）中，在那里，我们读到：<br />祂将命倾倒，以至于死。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛53.12.htm">以赛亚书53:12</a>）<br />这同样的状态就是祂在父面前的谦卑状态，祂在这种状态下向父祷告；祂说，祂行父的旨意，并将所行所言都归于父。从这些经文明显可知，祂向父祷告：马太福音26:36－44；马可福音1:35；6:46；14:32－39；路加福音5:16；6:12；22:41－44；约翰福音17:9，15，20。祂行父的旨意：约翰福音4:34；5:30祂将所行所言归于父：约翰福音8:26，27，28；12:49，50；14:10。<br />祂甚至在十字架上大声喊叫：<br />我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.46.htm">马太福音27:46</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可15.34.htm">马可福音15:34</a>）<br />而且，若未曾处于这种状态，祂不可能被钉死在十字架上。荣耀的状态也是合一的状态。当祂在三个门徒面前变像，以及施行奇迹时，祂便处于这样的状态。每当祂说，父与祂为一，父在祂里面，祂在父里面，凡父所有的都是祂的时，也处在这样的状态。完全合一后，祂说祂有权柄管理凡有血气的（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.2.htm">约翰福音17:2</a>）；天上地下所有的权柄都赐给祂了（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">马太福音28:18</a>）等等。</p>

<p>
104. (8)當祂在倒空時, 祂處在趨向聯合的狀態; 當祂被榮耀時, 祂處在聯合本身的狀態。 <p>基督徒教會認同, 主在世時, 曾處於兩種狀態:一個被稱為"倒空", 另一個被稱為"榮耀"。
<p>先前的狀態——倒空的狀態, 在聖言的許多章節有描述, 特別是在大衛的『詩篇』以及先知書裡。在以賽亞書有一節說:"祂將命傾倒, 以致於死(<a href="3927/isaiah_53_12.htm">以賽亞書53:12</a>)"。這樣的狀態就是祂在父面前的虛己, 因為在那樣的狀態下, 祂向父禱告, 並說祂在行父的旨意, 將自己一切所行所言歸功於父。
<p>祂向父的禱告在這些章節顯而易見:<a href="3927/matthew_26_36.htm">馬太福音26:36-44</a>;<a href="3927/mark_1_35.htm">馬可福音1:35</a>; <a href="3927/mark_6_46.htm">6:46</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_32.htm">14:32-39</a>;<a href="3927/luke_5_16.htm">路加福音5:16</a>; <a href="3927/luke_6_12.htm">6:12</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_41.htm">22:41-44</a>;<a href="3927/john_17_9.htm">約翰福音17:9</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_20.htm">20</a>。以下可看出, 祂行父的旨意:<a href="3927/john_4_34.htm">約翰福音4:34</a>; <a href="3927/john_5_30.htm">5:30</a>。以下說明祂將自己一切所行所言都歸於父:<a href="3927/john_8_26.htm">約翰福音8:26-28</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_49.htm">12:49-50</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">14:10</a>。
<p>實際上, 祂在十字架上的呼叫:"我的上帝, 我的上帝, 禰為什麼離棄我？"(<a href="3927/matthew_27_46.htm">馬太福音27:46</a>;<a href="3927/mark_15_34.htm">馬可福音15:34</a>)。而且, 倘若祂未曾處於這樣的狀態, 祂就不可能被釘死在十字架上。
<p>被榮耀的狀態就是被聯合的狀態。當祂在三個門徒面前變像時, 祂就處於這樣的狀態。當祂行神跡時, 處於這樣的狀態。祂常說父與祂為一,父在祂內祂在父內,凡父所有的都是祂的, 也處在這樣的狀態。當完全聯合後, 祂說祂有權柄管理凡有血氣的(<a href="3927/john_17_2.htm">約翰福音17:2</a>); 以及天上地上一切的權柄都是祂的(<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">馬太福音28:18</a>), 以及其它章節。 </p>

104. 8. When the Lord was being emptied out he was in a state of progress toward union; when he was being glorified he was in a state of union itself. The church recognizes that the Lord had two states while he was in the world: one called being emptied out; the other called glorification.
<p>The prior state, being emptied out, is described in many passages in the Word, especially in the Psalms of David, but also in the Prophets. There is even one passage in Isaiah 53 where it says, "He emptied out his soul even to death" (<a href="3927/isaiah_53_12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>). This same state also entailed the Lord's being humbled before the Father. In this state he prayed to the Father. In this state he says that he is doing the Father's will and attributes everything he has done and said to the Father.
<p>The following passages show that he prayed to the Father: <a href="3927/matthew_26_36.htm">Matthew 26:36-44</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>; <a href="3927/mark_6_46.htm">6:46</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_32.htm">14:32-39</a>; <a href="3927/luke_5_16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>; <a href="3927/luke_6_12.htm">6:12</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_41.htm">22:41-44</a>; <a href="3927/john_17_9.htm">John 17:9</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_20.htm">20</a>. The following show that he did the Father's will: <a href="3927/john_4_34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="3927/john_5_30.htm">5:30</a>. The following show that he attributed everything he had done and said to the Father: <a href="3927/john_8_26.htm">John 8:26-28</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_49.htm">12:49-50</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">14:10</a>.<p>In fact, he cried out on the cross, "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?" (<a href="3927/matthew_27_46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>; <a href="3927/mark_15_34.htm">Mark 15:34</a>). Furthermore, without this state it would have been impossible to crucify him.
<p>The state of being glorified is also a state of union. The Lord was in this state when he was transfigured before three of his disciples. He was in it when he performed miracles. He was in it as often as he said that the Father and he were one, that the Father was in him and he was in the Father, and that all things belonging to the Father were his. After complete union he said he had power over all flesh (<a href="3927/john_17_2.htm">John 17:2</a>) and all power in heaven and on earth (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). There are also other such passages. </p>

104. (viii) HIS PROGRESS TOWARDS UNION WAS HIS STATE OF EXINANITION, AND THE UNION ITSELF IS HIS STATE OF GLORIFICATION.<p>It is well known in the church that when the Lord was in the world He underwent two states, which are known as exinanition and glorification. The earlier state, that of exinanition, is described in many passages of the Word, especially in the Psalms of David, and also in the Prophets, in detail in Isaiah chapter 53, where we read that He emptied His soul to the point of death (<a href="3927/isaiah_53_12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>). This same state is that of His humility before the Father, for in that state He prayed to the Father, and says that He is doing the Father's will, and He ascribes all that He did and said to the Father. His praying to the Father is evident from these passages: <a href="3927/matthew_26_39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_26_42.htm">42</a> <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>

His doing the Father's will: <a href="3927/john_4_34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="3927/john_5_30.htm">5:30</a>. His ascribing to the Father all that He did and said: <a href="3927/john_8_26.htm">John 8:26-28</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_49.htm">12:49-50</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">14:10</a>. Indeed, He cried out on the cross: 'My God, my God, why are you abandoning me?' (<a href="3927/matthew_27_46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>; <a href="3927/mark_15_34.htm">Mark 15:34</a>). Moreover, if He had not been in this state, He could not have been crucified.<p>The state of glorification is the state of being united. He was in this state when He was transfigured before His three disciples, and when He performed the miracles, and each time He said that the Father and He were one, that the Father was in Him and He in the Father, and that all things of the Father's were His. After their complete union He said that He had power over all flesh (<a href="3927/john_17_2.htm">John 17:2</a>); and all power in heaven and upon earth (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>), and much besides.<p>

104. (8) The progress towards union was His state of Exinanition [emptying Himself], and the union itself is His state of Glorification.

But the state of glorification is also the state of union. He was in that state when He was transfigured before His three disciples, and also when He wrought miracles, and whenever He said that the Father and He are one, that the Father is in Him and He in the Father, and that all things of the Father are His; and, when the union was complete, that He had "power over all flesh" (<a href="3927/john_17_2.htm">John 17:2</a>), and "all power in heaven and on earth" (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>); besides other things. </p>
