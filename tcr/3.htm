<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>3</b>.新天堂与新教会的具体信仰如下：<br />耶和华神是爱本身和智慧本身，或良善本身和真理本身。祂以神圣真理的形式，即圣言、与神同在之神而降世，并取了人的形式，以便将天堂、地狱和教会的一切都归入秩序。因为那时，地狱的力量胜过了天堂的力量，地上恶的力量胜过了善的力量，因此一场灭顶之灾的威胁即将来临。耶和华神藉着祂的人身，就是神圣真理，消除了这个迫在眉睫的诅咒，从而救赎了天使和人类，祂随即以其人性将神圣真理与神圣良善，或神圣智慧与神圣之爱结合起来，因而以其荣耀的人性并连同它一起回到自永恒就是祂的神性中。所有这一切就是约翰福音中这些话的含义：<br />道与神同在，道就是神。道成了肉身。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">约翰福音1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />我由父而出，到了世界；我又离开世界，去父那里。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.28.htm">约翰福音16:28</a>）还有：<br />我们也知道神的儿子已经来到，且将智慧赐给我们，使我们认识那位真实的，我们也在那位真实的里面，就是在祂儿子耶稣基督里面。这是真神，也是永生。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约壹5.20.htm">约翰一书5:20</a>）<br />上述经文表明，若没有主的降世，没有人能得救。今天的情形也差不多。若非主以神圣真理的形式，即圣言，再次降世，如今无人得救。<br />在人这一方，信的具体细节是：<br />①神是一，圣三一在祂里面，祂是主神救主耶稣基督。<br />②得救之信就是信祂。<br />③诸恶莫作，因为它们属于魔鬼并来自魔鬼。<br />④众善奉行，因为它们属于神并来自神。<br />⑤人必须貌似凭自己做出这些行为，但必须相信它们出自在他里面并通过他作工的主。<br />①②涉及信，③④涉及仁，⑤涉及仁与信的结合，因而涉及主与人的结合。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #3 </h4>
<p>
3. 新天國與新教會的信仰, 其具體形式如下:
<p>耶和華上帝是仁(愛)之本和智(慧)之本, 是(良)善之本和(真)理之本。作為神性真理(簡稱"聖理"), 或者"與上帝同在"的"道", 祂為了使天國,地獄和教會的一切都重新歸入神性規則(簡稱"聖規"), 祂降世並取了人身向世人顯現。因為那時, 地獄的力量正勝過天國, 人世間惡已勝善, 這樣的後果將帶來極大的詛咒, 人類面臨滅亡。靠著祂的所取之人, 耶和華上帝消融了這個即將發生的詛咒, 並救贖了天人和人類。然後在祂的所取之人中, 祂將聖理(即神性真理)與聖善(即神性良善),或聖智(即神性智慧)與聖仁(即神性仁愛)聯合。以這種方式, 與祂的人身一起,並在這個人身之中(已被榮耀), 回到祂從永恆就有的神性。
<p>『約翰福音』中這些話正是此意:"道與上帝同在, 道就是上帝。道成了肉身(<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">約翰福音1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>)"。在同一福音書:"我由父而出, 到了世界; 我又離開世界, 去父那裡(<a href="3927/john_16_28.htm">約翰福音16:28</a>)"。也通過這些話來表達:"我們也知道上帝的兒子已經來到, 且將智慧賜給我們, 使我們認識那位真實的, 我們也在那位真實的裡面, 就是在祂兒子耶穌基督裡面。這是真上帝, 也是永生。(<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">約翰一書5:20</a>)
<p>從這些話可清楚看出, 主若未曾降臨人間, 無人得救。今天的情形類似, 若非主以聖理的形式——也就是以道的形式再次降臨人間, 無人得救。
<p>此信仰的具體形式, 在人方面:
<p>(1)有一位上帝, 聖三一存在於祂之中, 祂是主上帝我們的拯救者耶穌基督。
<p>(2)相信祂是得救之信。
<p>(3)諸惡莫作——惡屬於魔鬼並來自魔鬼。
<p>(4)眾善奉行——善屬於上帝並來自上帝。
<p>(5)如此奉行, 如同靠自己而行; 不過必須相信, 這樣行是來自於主與人同工,並通過人行出來。
<p>(1)(2)是關於信, (3)(4)關於義, (5)是關於義與信的聯合,也就是主與人的合作。

3. The faith of the new heaven and the new church in a specific form is this: Jehovah God is love itself and wisdom itself, or goodness itself and truth itself. As divine truth, or the Word, which was "God with God," he came down and took on a human manifestation for the purpose of forcing everything in heaven, everything in hell, and everything in the church back into the divine design. The power of hell had become stronger than the power of heaven, and on earth the power of evil had become stronger than the power of goodness; therefore total damnation stood threatening at the door. By means of his human manifestation, which was divine truth, Jehovah God lifted this pending damnation and redeemed both people and angels. Afterward, in his human manifestation, he united divine truth to divine goodness, or divine wisdom to divine love. In this way he returned to the divine nature that he had had from eternity, together with and in the human manifestation, which had been glorified. These things are meant by this statement in John: "The Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word became flesh" (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>). And in the same Gospel, "I went out from the Father and came into the world; again I am leaving the world and am going to the Father" (<a href="3927/john_16_28.htm">John 16:28</a>). And also by this: "We know that the Son of God came and gave us understanding so that we would know the truth. And we are in the truth in the Son of God, Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life" ( <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>). From all this it is clear that if the Lord had not come into the world no one could have been saved.
<p>The situation today is similar. Therefore if the Lord does not come into the world again in the form of divine truth, which is the Word, no one can be saved.
</p>
<p>
[2] For our part, the specifics of faith are these: <p>(1) There is one God, the divine Trinity exists within him, and he is the Lord God the Savior Jesus Christ. <p>(2) Believing in him is a faith that saves. <p>(3) We must not do things that are evil - they belong to the Devil and come from the Devil. <p>(4) We must do things that are good - they belong to God and come from God. <p>(5) We must do these things as if we ourselves were doing them, but we must believe that they come from the Lord working with us and through us.
<p>The first two points have to do with faith, the second two have to do with goodwill; and the fifth has to do with the partnership between goodwill and faith, the partnership between the Lord and us. </p>

3. THE FAITH OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW CHURCH IN PARTICULAR TERMS IS AS FOLLOWS.<p>Jehovah God is Love itself and Wisdom itself, or Good itself and Truth itself. He came down in the form of Divine Truth, which is the Word and which was God with God, and took upon Himself human form, so as to reduce to order everything in heaven, in hell and in the church. For at that time the power of hell was stronger than the power of heaven, and on earth the power of evil was stronger than the power of good, so that utter damnation stood threatening at the gates. This impending damnation was removed by Jehovah God by means of His Human, which was Divine Truth, and thus angels and men were redeemed. Afterwards He united in His Human Divine Truth with Divine Good, or Divine Wisdom with Divine Love, and so returned into the Divinity which was His from eternity, together with and in His glorified Human. This is the meaning of the passage in John:<p>The Word was with God and the Word was God; and the Word was made flesh, <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>In the same gospel:<p>I came out of the Father and I came into the world; I leave the world again, and go to the Father, <a href="3927/john_16_28.htm">John 16:28</a>.<p>Further in the following passage:<p>We know that the Son of God came and gave us understanding, so that we might know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son, Jesus Christ. He is the true God and everlasting life. <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>.<p>These passages show that without the Lord's coming into the world no one could have been saved. The situation today is similar. So unless the Lord comes into the world again in the form of Divine Truth, that is, the Word, no more can anyone now be saved.</p>
<p>
[2] The particular details of faith on man's part are:<p>1 God is one, in whom is the Divine Trinity, and He is the Lord God the Saviour Jesus Christ.<p>2 Faith leading to salvation is believing in Him.<p>3 Evil actions must not be done because they are the work of the devil and come from him.<p>4 Good actions must be done because they are the work of God and come from Him.<p>5 A person must perform these actions as if they were his own, but he must believe they come from the Lord working in him and through him.<p>The first two points deal with faith, the second two with charity; and the fifth deals with the joining of charity with faith and thus of the Lord with men. </p>

3. THE FAITH OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND OF THE NEW CHURCH IN A PARTICULAR FORM is as follows: <p>Jehovah God is love itself and wisdom itself, or is good itself and truth itself; and in respect to Divine truth, which is the Word, and which was God with God, He came down and took on the Human for the purpose of reducing to order all things that were in heaven, and all things in hell, and all things in the church; because at that time the power of hell prevailed over the power of heaven, and upon the earth the power of evil over the power of good, and in consequence a total damnation stood threatening at the door. This impending damnation Jehovah God removed by means of His Human, which was Divine truth, and thus He redeemed angels and men, and thereupon He united, in His Human, Divine truth with Divine good or Divine wisdom with Divine love; and so, with and in His glorified Human, He returned into His Divine in which He was from eternity. All this is meant by these words in John: <p>The Word was with God, and God was the Word. And the Word became flesh (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>); <p>and in the same: <p>I came out from the Father and am come into the world; again I leave the world and go unto the Father (<a href="3927/john_16_28.htm">16:28</a>); <p>and also by these words: <p>We know that the Son of God is come, and has given us understanding that we may know the True; and we are in the True, in His Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and life eternal (1<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">John 5:20</a>). <p>From these words it is clear that without the Lord's coming into the world no one could have been saved. It is the same today; and therefore without the Lord's coming again into the world in Divine truth, which is the Word, no one can be saved.
</p>
<p>
[2] THE PARTICULARS OF FAITH ON MAN'S PART are: <p>(1) God is one, in whom is a Divine trinity, and the Lord God the Savior Jesus Christ is that one. <p>(2) Saving faith is to believe in Him. <p>(3) Evils should not be done, because they are of the devil and from the devil. <p>(4) Goods should be done, because they are of God and from God. <p>(5) These should be done by man as if by himself; but it should be believed that they are done by the Lord in man and through man. <p>The first two are matters of faith, the next two of charity, and the fifth of the conjunction of charity and faith, thus of the conjunction of the Lord and man. </p>

3. The Faith of the new Heaven and the New Church, in its Particular Form, is as follows: Jehovah God is Love itself and Wisdom itself, or Good itself and Truth itself. He, as to the Divine Truth, which is the Word, and which was God with God, came down and assumed the Human, to the end that He might restore to order all things in heaven, in hell and in the Church. For at that time the power of hell prevailed over the power of heaven, and on earth the power of evil prevailed over the power of good. Consequently mankind was threatened with imminent destruction. This impending destruction Jehovah God prevented by means of His Human, which was the Divine Truth, and so He redeemed both angels and men. He afterwards united in His Human Divine Truth with Divine Good, or Divine Wisdom with Divine Love; and thus together with, and in, His Glorified Human He returned to the Divine in whom He was from eternity. This is meant by these words in John:<p>"The Word was with God, and the Word was God... and the Word was made flesh" <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>;<p>and again:<p>"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again I leave the world and go to the Father" <a href="3927/john_16_28.htm">16:28</a>;<p>and further:<p>"We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know Him that is true; and we are in Him that is true, even in His Son, Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life" <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>.<p>From these passages it is clear that unless the Lord had come into the world no one could have been saved. The case is similar to-day; and therefore unless the Lord comes again into the world in the Divine Truth, which is the Word, no one can be saved.</p>
<p>
[2] The particulars of faith on man's part are:<p>(1) God is one, in whom is the Divine Trinity, and He is the Lord God the Savior Jesus Christ.<p>(2) A saving faith is to believe on Him.<p>(3) Evil actions ought not to be done, because they are of the devil and from the devil.<p>(4) Good actions ought to be done, because they are of God and from God.<p>(5) Moreover these things ought to be done by man as of himself; but he should believe that they are from the Lord acting with him and through him.<p>The first two particulars have reference to faith, the next two to charity, and the fifth to the union of charity and faith, and thereby of the Lord and man. </p>

3. FIDES NOVI COELI ET NOVAE ECCLESIAE IN SINGULARI FORMA, haec est: Quod Jehovah Deus sit Ipse Amor et Ipsa Sapientia, seu quod sit Ipsum Bonum et Ipsum Verum, et quod Ipse quoad Divinum Verum, quod est Verbum, et quod fuit Deus apud Deum, descenderit, et assumserit Humanum, propter finem, ut in ordinem redigeret omnia quae in Coelo, et omnia quae in Inferno, et omnia quae in Ecclesia erant; quoniam tunc potentia Inferni valuit super potentiam Coeli, et in Terris potentia mali super potentiam boni, et inde totalis damnatio ante fores stetit et imminuit. Hanc futuram Damnationem Jehovah Deus per Humanum suum, quod erat Divinum Verum, sustulit, et sic Angelos et Homines redemit: ac postea in Humano suo univit Divinum Verum Divino Bono, seu Divinam Sapientiam Divino Amori, et sic rediit in suum Divinum in Quo ab aeterno fuit, una cum et in glorificato Humano. Haec intelliguntur per hoc apud Johannem, "Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum: et Verbum Caro factum est," <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>; et apud Eundem, Exivi a Patre, et veni in Mundum; iterum relinquo Mundum, et vado ad Patrem, <a href="3927/john_16_28.htm">16:28</a>. Et porro per hoc, "Scimus quod Filius Dei venerit, et dederit nobis intelligentiam, ut cognoscamus Verum, et sumus in Vero in Filio Ipsius Jesu Christo: Hic est verus Deus et Vita aeterna," <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 Johannes 5:20</a>. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Ex his patet, quod absque adventu Domini in Mundum, nullus salvari potuerit. Simile est hodie; quare nisi Dominus iterum in Mundum veniat in Divino Vero, quod est Verbum, nec quisquam potest salvari.</p>
<p>
[2] Singularia fidei a parte hominis sunt; 1. Quod Deus sit Unus, in Quo Divina Trinitas, et quod Ille sit Dominus Deus Salvator Jesus Christus. 2. Quod Fides salvifica sit credere in Ipsum. 3. Quod non facienda sint mala, quia sunt diaboli, et a diabolo. 4. Quod facienda sint bona, quia sunt Dei et a Deo. 5. Et quod haec facienda sint ab homine ut ab Ipso; at quod credendum sit, quod sint a Domino apud illum et per illum. Duo priora sunt Fidei, duo posteriora sunt charitatis; et quintum est conjunctionis charitatis et fidei, ita Domini et hominis.<p>
