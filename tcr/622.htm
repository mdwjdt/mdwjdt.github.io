622. The second memorable occurrence. People's preparation for heaven occurs in the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell. Once the time of their preparation has come to an end, they are all seized with an intense longing for heaven. Soon their eyes are opened and they see a pathway to a community in heaven. They take this pathway and make their ascent. At the top they come to a gated entrance with a guard. The guard opens the gate and allows them in. Then someone stops them for questioning and passes on word from the governor that they are to go farther into the community and look around to see whether there are any homes there that they recognize as their own. (There is a new home for every newly arrived angel.) If they find their home, they stay there and send a report back to that effect. If they do not find a home there, they go back and say that they did not see one. In that case, a wise person explores whether the light they have agrees with the light in that community, and especially whether the heat they have is the same. In essence, the light in heaven is divine truth and the heat is divine goodness. Both of them emanate from the Lord, who is the sun there. If the new arrivals have a different light and heat than that community has, that is, if they have a different truth and goodness, they are not accepted there. They leave and travel along pathways that are open between communities in heaven until they find a community that is in complete harmony with the feelings in their hearts. That is their home forever, because there they are among their own people, who are like relatives and friends that they love with all their heart because they share the same passions. There they experience the happiness that makes them most alive and their heart fills with delight because their soul is at peace. The intense pleasure of the heat and light of heaven cannot be expressed in words. Angels share that joy with each other. This is what happens to people who become angels.
</p>
<p>
[2] People who are involved in evils and falsities are given permission to go up to heaven as well; but when they enter it they begin to gasp and struggle for breath. Soon their vision blurs, their intellect shuts down and their thinking comes to a stop, and they feel as though they are looking death in the face, so they stand there stock-still. Then they start to have heart palpitations and chest pains, and their mind is overcome with agony and an ever increasing torment. By that point they are writhing like a snake placed too close to a fire. They roll themselves away and hurl themselves over a cliff that appears at that moment; they do not stop moving until they are in hell among people like themselves where they can take a deep breath and where their heart can again beat at its own rhythm.
<p>After that they hate heaven, they reject the truth, and they have a blasphemous ill will toward the Lord, because they believe that he was responsible for the torture and torment they suffered in heaven.
</p>
<p>
[3] From these few sentences you can see what outcome awaits people who regard the truths that relate to faith as worthless (even though those truths constitute the light that angels have in heaven) and who regard good actions that come from love and goodwill as worthless (even though those good actions constitute the vital heat that angels have in heaven).
<p>You can also see how seriously mistaken it is to believe that everyone can enjoy the bliss of heaven once she or he is allowed in. Nevertheless there is a belief today that getting into heaven is just a matter of mercy; and that getting into heaven is just like going to a wedding reception in this world and experiencing joy and happiness there.
<p>People need to know that in the spiritual world, whatever desires you feel as a result of what you love and whatever thoughts they lead to are shared with everyone, because you will then be spirits, and desires related to love and the thoughts that result are the life of the spirit. Compatible desires bring people together and incompatible desires drive them apart; and incompatibility of that kind causes torment. A devil experiences this torment in heaven and an angel experiences it in hell. Therefore spirits are appropriately separated from each other based on all the varieties and diversities and differences in the desires they have as a result of what they love. </p>

The second experience.<p>All who have been prepared for heaven, a process which takes place in the world of spirits, half-way between heaven and hell, after some time has passed, sigh and long for heaven. Soon their eyes are opened, and they see a road leading towards some community in heaven. So they take this road and climb up; and on the ascent there is a gate with a guard at it. The guard opens the gate and so they go in.<p>Then an investigator comes to meet them, who gives them a message from the governor to go further in and search to see if anywhere there are houses which they recognise as their own; for there is a new house for every newly-arrived angel. If they find one, they report this and stay in it.<p>But if they do not find one, they come back and say they have not seen one. Then a wise man there checks to see whether the light that is in them agrees with the light in the community, and what is more important, whether their heat does. For the light of heaven is in its essence Divine truth, and the heat of heaven is in its essence Divine good, both of them proceeding from the Lord as the sun there. If the light and heat in them is different from that in the community, if, that is, the truth and good are different, they are not made welcome. So they go away and travel along roads which open up between communities in heaven; and they continue to travel until they find a community which exactly matches their affections, and there they live for ever. For there they are among their own people, as if among relations and friends, and they love them from the heart because they share the same affection. There they enjoy the whole bliss of their life and the pleasure which fills the whole breast coming from tranquillity of the soul. For the heat and light of heaven contain an inexpressible delight, which is shared. That is the lot of those who become angels.</p>
<p>
 [2] Those, however, who are subject to evils and falsities may get permission to go up to heaven, but on entering they begin to gasp and breathe with difficulty. Soon their sight becomes dim, their understanding is darkened and thought comes to a stop; it is as if death stared them in the face, and so they stand like blocks of wood. Then their heart begins to pound, their chest feels tight and their mind is desperately worried. Their pain becomes more and more severe, and in this condition they writhe like snakes placed on a hearth. So they roll away from this spot, and cast themselves over a precipice which then appears; and they do not rest until they are in hell with people like themselves, where they can draw breath and where their heart beats freely. After this they hate heaven and reject truth, in their hearts blaspheming against the Lord and believing Him responsible for the pain and torment they experienced in heaven.</p>
<p>
[3] These few remarks will enable it to be seen what is the fate of those who treat as of no consequence the truths of faith that none the less constitute the light enjoyed by the angels of heaven, or the kinds of good which make up love and charity, despite the fact that they constitute the vital heat enjoyed by the angels of heaven. It can also be seen from this how erroneous is the view of those who believe that anyone can enjoy the blessedness of heaven, so long as he is allowed in. It is believed at the present time that it is nothing but mercy which secures admission to heaven, and that this is like someone in the world coming into a house where there is a wedding, and so at the same time joining in the joy and happiness there. They ought to know that in the spiritual world the affections of love and the thoughts they produce are shared with others, since a person is then a spirit, and the life of a spirit is the affection of love and the resulting thought. Affection of the same kind establishes a link, affection of different kinds causes separation. It is this difference in affection which causes torment to a devil in heaven, or an angel in hell. For this reason people are properly separated according to the diversities, varieties and differences in the affections which make up their love.<p>

622. Second Memorable Relation: <p>All who have been prepared for heaven (which is done in the world of spirits, which is intermediate between heaven and hell), when the time is completed wish for heaven with great longing; and soon their eyes are opened and they see a path leading to some society in heaven; they take this path and ascend, and in the ascent there is a gate and a keeper there. He opens the gate, and they enter in through it. <p>Then an examiner meets them, who tells them from the president to enter still further and to look about and see whether there are houses anywhere which they recognize as their own, for there is a new house for every novitiate angel. If they find one they so report and remain there. <p>But if they do not find one they return and say that they have not seen any. And then an examination is made by a certain wise one there whether the light that is in them harmonizes with that in the society, and especially whether the heat does; for the light of heaven in its essence is Divine truth, and the heat of heaven in its essence is good, both going forth from the Lord there as a sun. If there is in them a light and a heat different from the light and heat of that society, that is, a different kind of good and truth, they are not received. Therefore they leave that place, and through ways opened between the societies in heaven they pass on; and this they do until they find a society perfectly harmonious with their affections, and this becomes their abode forever. For they are then among their own, just as if among relatives and friends whom they love from the heart, because they are in like affections; and there they are in their life's happiness, and in the joy of their whole bosom from peace of mind, for in the light and heat of heaven there is ineffable delight, which is shared. Thus it happens with those who are becoming angels.
</p>
<p>
[2] And yet those who are in evils and falsities may ascend to heaven by permission; but when they enter they begin to catch their breath and to breathe with difficulty; and presently their sight grows dim, their understanding is darkened, they cease to think, a kind of oblivion hovers before their eyes, and so they stand like stocks. Then the heart begins to throb, the chest to be oppressed, the mind is seized with anguish, and their distress increases more and more; and in this state they writhe like serpents brought near a fire, so that they roll themselves away, and by a steep descent which then appears, they cast themselves down, and do not rest until they are in hell among their like, where they can draw breath and where their hearts beat freely. After this they hate heaven, reject truth, and in heart blaspheme the Lord, believing that their pains and torments in heaven were from Him.
</p>
<p>
[3] From these few things it can be seen what the lot is of those who have no regard for the truths of faith, which nevertheless constitute the light in which the angels of heaven are, and who have no regard for the goods of love and charity, which nevertheless constitute the heat of life in which the angels of heaven are; and it will also be seen therefrom, how greatly those err who believe that anyone may enjoy heavenly happiness if only he is admitted into heaven. For it is the belief of the present day, that to be received into heaven is a matter of mercy only and that a man's reception into heaven is like entering a house in the world where there is a wedding, and being admitted at once into its joys and festivities. But let it be understood that in the spiritual world there is a sharing of the love's affections and the thoughts arising from them, since man is then a spirit, and the life of the spirit is the love's affection and its thought; also that homogeneous affection conjoins while heterogeneous affection separates, and both to a devil in heaven and to an angel in hell heterogeneity is torture; and for this reason they are separated in strict accordance with the diversities, varieties, and differences of the affections pertaining to the love. </p>

<p>
622. The second experience. The preparation for heaven takes place in the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell. After all have undergone their period of preparation, they eagerly long for heaven. Presently their eyes are opened and they see a path leading to some particular society in heaven. They take this path and begin their journey upward. On the road up there is a gate with a keeper standing by who opens it, and they proceed through it. An examiner then meets them; and he informs them from the governor that they may proceed farther and find out if there are any houses which they recognize as their own; for there is a new house provided for every novitiate angel. If they find it, they report the fact and settle down there.<p>However, if they do not, they return and say they have not seen any. Then an examination is made by some wise person there to see whether the light, and especially the heat, in them harmonize with the light and heat in that society; for the light of heaven in its essence is Divine Truth, and the heat of heaven in its essence is Divine Good, both proceeding from the Lord as the Sun there. If the light and heat in them differ from those in that society, that is, if their truth and good are different, they are not received. They depart, therefore, and pass along the roads that are open from one society to another in heaven, journeying till they find one that is wholly in agreement with their own affections, and this becomes their home for ever. For there they are among their own, as among relatives and friends, whom they love from the heart because their affections are similar. There they enjoy their own life's happiness in whole-hearted pleasure from peace of soul; for in the heat and light of heaven there is ineffable delight, which is shared by all. Thus it is with those who become angels.</p>
<p>
[2] On the other hand, those who are in evils and falsities may be permitted to ascend into heaven; but as soon as they enter they begin to pant, and breathe with difficulty. Presently their sight grows dim, their understanding is obscured, they cease to think, death seems to stare them in the face, and they stand stock still. Then the heart begins to beat wildly, their breast is constricted, their mind is seized with anguish and their torture increases more and more. In this state they writhe like serpents brought close to a fire; and rolling downwards they cast themselves over a precipice which then appears; nor do they come to rest until they are in hell among their like, where they can breathe again and where their heart beats freely. They afterwards hate heaven, reject the truth, and in their heart blaspheme the Lord, believing that the pains and torments they suffered in heaven were from Him.</p>
<p>
[3] From this brief account it may be seen what is the lot of those who make light of the truths of faith, which nevertheless constitute the light of the angels of heaven; and who make light also of the goods of love and charity, which yet constitute the life's heat of the angels of heaven. It may also be seen how greatly they err who believe that every one can enjoy heavenly blessedness, provided he is admitted into heaven. For it is the belief at this day that to be received into heaven is an act of pure mercy, and that it is like going to a wedding in the world and participating at once in its joy and gladness. But it should be known that in the spiritual world there is a common participation in affections of love and consequent thoughts. For man is then a spirit, and the life of a spirit is affection of love and consequent thought; and similar affection unites, but dissimilar affection separates; and dissimilarity is the cause of the torment which a devil would suffer in heaven, and an angel in hell. On this account angels and devils are properly separated according to the diversities, varieties and differences of affections which are of love. </p>

622. SECUNDUM MEMORABILE.<p>Omnes qui ad Coelum praeparati sunt, quod fit in Mundo spirituum, qui est medius inter Coelum et Infernum, post exactum tempus, desiderant cum suspirio Coelum, et mox aperiuntur oculi illorum, et vident viam, quae tendit ad aliquam Societatem in Coelo; hanc viam intrant et ascendunt; et in ascensu est porta, et ibi custos; hic aperit portam, et sic ingrediuntur; tunc obviam fit eis Inquisitor, qui illis a Moderatore dicit, ut penitius intrent et inquirant, num alicubi Domus sint, quas agnoscant ut suas, nam pro quovis novitio Angelo est nova domus, et si inveniunt, renuntiant hoc, et manent ibi; at si non inveniunt, redeunt, et dicunt, quod non viderint; et tunc a quodam Sapiente ibi exploratur, Numeri Lux quae in illis est, concordat cum luce quae in societate est, et imprimis Numeri Calor; Lux enim Coeli in sua essentia est Divinum Verum, et Calor Coeli in sua essentia est Divinum Bonum, utrumque procedens a Domino ut Sole ibi; si alia Lux et alius Calor, quam Lux et Calor illius Societatis in illis sunt, hoc est, si aliud Verum et Bonum, non recipiuntur, quare abeunt inde, et per vias inter Societates in Coelo apertas vadunt, et hoc usque dum inveniunt Societatem affectionibus illorum prorsus congruam, et ibi fit habitatio illorum in aeternum; sunt enim ibi inter suos, quemadmodum inter affines et amicos, quos, quia in simili affectione sunt, ex corde amant, et ibi sunt in vitae suae faustitate, et in totius pectoris sui ex pace animae jucunditate, est enim in Calore et Luce Coeli delitium ineffabile, quod communicatur; ita fit cum illis qui Angeli fiunt.</p>
<p>
[2] Sed qui in malis et falsis sunt, illis ex venia licet ascendere in Coelum, sed cum intrant, incipiunt trahere animam, et respirare cum lucta; et mox obscuratur visus illorum, et caligat intellectus, et cessat cogitatio, ac sicut lethus obversatur oculis, et sic stant sicut stipites; et tunc incipit cor pulsare, pectus angustari, et mens corripi angore, et plus et plus cruciari, et in eo statu se contorquent sicut serpentes admoti foco, quare devolvunt se inde, et per praecipitium, quod tunc apparet, se dejiciunt, nec quiescunt, quam in Inferno apud sui similes, ubi possunt animam trahere, et ubi cor illorum libere vibratur. Postea odio habent Coelum, et rejiciunt Verum, ac corde blasphemant Dominum, credentes quod cruciatus et tormina illorum in Coelo ab Ipso fuerint.</p>
<p>
[3] Ex his paucis videri potest, qualis sors illorum est, qui floccipendunt Veritates quae fidei sunt, quae tamen faciunt lucem in qua sunt Angeli Coeli, et qui floccipendunt Bona, quae amoris et Charitatis sunt, quae tamen faciunt calorem vitae in quo sunt <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Angeli Coeli: tum ex his videri potest, quantum errant, qui credunt, quod quisque possit frui beatitudine Coelesti, modo admittatur in Coelum; Fides enim hodie est, quod in Coelum recipi, sit ex sola Misericordia; et quod receptio in Coelum sit, sicut qui in Mundo in Domum Nuptiarum venit, et tunc simul in gaudia et laetitias ibi; at sciant, quod communicatio affectionum amoris et inde cogitationum sit in Mundo spirituali, quoniam Homo tunc Spiritus est, et Vita Spiritus est affectio amoris et inde cogitatio; et quod affectio homogenea conjungat, et affectio heterogenea separet, et quod heterogeneum cruciet, diabolum in Coelo, et angelum in Inferno; quamobrem separati sunt juste secundum diversitates, varietates, et differentias affectionum quae amoris sunt.<p>
