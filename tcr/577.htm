577. It follows from this that the Lord is constantly active in regenerating us. He is constantly active in saving us, and no one can be saved without being regenerated, as the Lord himself says in John: "Those who are not born again cannot see the kingdom of God" (<a href="3927/john_3_3.htm">John 3:3</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_5.htm">5-6</a>). Regeneration is therefore the means of being saved; and goodwill and faith are the means of being regenerated.
<p>The notion that we are regenerated as a consequence of simply having the faith that is preached by the church of today - a faith that involves no cooperation on our part - is the height of foolishness.
</p>
<p>
[2] The kind of action and cooperation just described is visible in action and movement of all types. The interaction between the heart and all its arteries is an example. The heart acts and the arteries use their sheaths and linings to cooperate; this results in circulation. A similar thing happens with the lungs. The air pressure, which depends on the height of the atmosphere above it, acts upon the lungs; the lungs work the ribs, which is immediately followed by the ribs working the lungs. This breathing motion affects every membrane in the body. The meninges of the brain, the pleura, the peritoneum, the diaphragm, and all the other membranes that cover the internal organs and inwardly hold them together, act and react and cooperate in this way, because they are flexible. Together these movements provide for our continued existence.
<p>A similar thing happens in every fiber and nerve and in every muscle. In fact it even occurs in every piece of cartilage. It is well documented that in each of these there is an [initiating] action and then a cooperation.
</p>
<p>
[3] Such cooperation also exists in all our bodily senses. Just like the motor organs, the sensory organs consist of fibers, membranes, and muscles; but there is no need to describe the cooperation of each one. It is well known that light acts upon the eye, sound upon the ear, odor upon the nose, taste upon the tongue; and that the organs adapt themselves to that input, which results in sensation.
<p>Surely everyone can see from these examples that thought and will could not exist unless there was a similar action and cooperation between life as it inflows and the spiritual organic structure underlying our brain. Life flows from the Lord into that organic structure. Because the organic structure cooperates, it perceives what it is thinking. Likewise it perceives what is under consideration there, what conclusion is formed, and what action it has decided to take. If the life force alone took action but we did not cooperate (seemingly on our own), our ability to think would not exceed a log's. We would have no more thought than a church building does when a minister is preaching; the church can indeed feel the reverberation of sound coming through the double doors as an echo, but it cannot appreciate anything about the sermon. We would be no different if we did not cooperate with the Lord in developing goodwill and faith. </p>

577. A further consequence of this is that the Lord is continually in the process of regenerating a person, because He is continually in the process of saving him, and no one can be saved unless he is regenerated, exactly as the Lord said in John: he who is not born again cannot see the kingdom of God (<a href="3927/john_3_3.htm">John 3:3</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_5.htm">5-6</a>). Regeneration is therefore the means to salvation, and charity and faith are the means to regeneration. The idea that regeneration comes as a consequence of the faith the present-day church upholds, that is, without the person's co-operation, is the height of folly.</p>
<p>
[2] Action and co-operation as here described can be observed in everything which has any activity and power of movement. Such is the action and co-operation of the heart and every one of its arteries. The heart acts and the artery uses its coverings or tunics to co-operate; and this is how the circulation of the blood works. It is much the same with the lungs. The air acts by the atmospheric pressure which depends on altitude, and the ribs first co-operate with the lungs, and then the lungs co-operate with the ribs. This is how every membrane in the body breathes. In the same way the meninges of the brain, the pleura, the peritoneum, the diaphragm and all the other coverings of the viscera and their inward structures act and are acted upon and so co-operate, since they are elastic. This is how they come into existence and continue in existence. It is much the same in every fibre and nerve, and in every muscle, even in every cartilage. It is well known that in each of these there is action and co-operation.</p>
<p>
[3] Every sense too affords an example of co-operation, for the sensory organs, like the motor organs, are composed of fibres, membranes and muscles. But it would be a waste of time to describe how each of them co-operates. We know that light acts on the eye, sound on the ear, smell on the nose, and taste on the tongue, and that the organs respond to these things, thus giving rise to sensation. Can anyone fail to perceive from this that if there were no such action and cooperation with inflowing life in the spiritual organism of the brain, thought and will could not come into existence? For life flows into that organism from the Lord, and because it co-operates the perception is possible of what is thought, likewise what is there judged, concluded and given expression in action. If all that happened was that life acted and the person did not co-operate as if of himself, he could no more think than a block of wood, or than the structure of a church can when a minister is preaching. In this case something like an echo may be experienced as the result of the reflexion of sound from the doors, but no speech. That is what a person would be like, if he did not cooperate with the Lord as regards charity and faith. </p>

<p>
577. From the foregoing it also follows, that the Lord is unceasingly in the act of regenerating man, because He is unceasingly in the act of saving him, and no one can be saved unless he is regenerated, according to the Lord's own words in John: <p>Except a man be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God (John 3:(<a href="3927/john_3_3.htm">John 3:3</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_5.htm">5-6</a>). <p>Regeneration, therefore, is the means of salvation, while charity and faith are the means of regeneration. To say that regeneration follows the faith of the present church, which leaves out man's co-operation, is vanity of vanities.
</p>
<p>
[2] The action and cooperation here described may be seen in everything that is in any state of activity and mobility. Such is the action and cooperation of the heart and of every artery thereof; the heart acts, and the arteries by their sheaths or coats cooperate; hence circulation. It is the same with the lungs. The air acts by its incumbent weight according to the height of the atmosphere, and at first the ribs cooperate with the lungs, and immediately after the lungs with the ribs; from which there is respiration in every membrane of the body. Thus the meninges of the brain, the pleura, the peritoneum, the diaphragm and the other parts which cover the viscera and enter into their composition, act and are acted upon, and thus they cooperate; for they are elastic; and from this is their existence and subsistence. It is the same in every fiber and nerve, and in every muscle, and even in every cartilage; in everyone of these, as is known, there is action and cooperation.
</p>
<p>
[3] There is such a cooperation also in every sense; for the sensories of the body, like the motor organs, consist of fibers, membranes, and muscles; but to describe the co-operative action of each, is needless; for it is known that light acts upon the eye, sound upon the ear, odor upon the nostrils, and taste upon the tongue, and that the organs adapt themselves thereto; from which there is sensation. Who cannot see from all this, that unless there were such action and cooperation with the influent life in the spiritual organism of the brain, will and thought could not exist? For life from the Lord flows into that organism, and because of this cooperation, man has a perception of what he thinks, and in like manner of what is there considered, concluded upon, and defined into act. If life were to act merely, and man were not to co-operate as if of himself, he could no more think than a stock, or than a temple while the minister is preaching in it. The temple may indeed, owing to the reverberation of the sound from its doors, have a sense, as it were, of the echo, but not of the discourse. So would man be, did he not co-operate with the Lord in respect to charity and faith. </p>

577. From what has been said it follows that the Lord is continually in the act of regenerating man, because He is continually in the act of saving him; and no one can be saved unless he is regenerated, according to the Lord's own words in John,<p>That he who is not born again cannot see the kingdom of God, <a href="3927/john_3_3.htm">John 3:3</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_5.htm">5-6</a>.<p>Regeneration, therefore, is the means of salvation, and charity and faith are the means of regeneration. It is utterly vain to suppose that regeneration results from the faith of the present Church, which excludes man's co-operation.</p>
<p>
[2] Action and co-operation, as have been described above, may be seen in every thing that is in a state of activity and mobility. The action and co-operation of the heart and its whole arterial system are of this kind; the heart acts, and the arteries, by their sheaths or coats, co-operate, and the circulation of the blood results. It is similar with the lungs; the air acts by pressure according to the height of the atmosphere, and the ribs first co-operate with the lungs, and immediately afterwards the lungs with the ribs, and the respiration of every membrane of the body results. It is in this way that the meninges of the brain, the pleura, the peritoneum, the diaphragm and the other membranes which cover the viscera, and which enter into their composition, act and are acted upon, and so co-operate, for they are in their natures elastic; and thus their existence and subsistence result. The case is similar in every fibre and nerve, in every muscle, and even in every cartilage, in every one of which, as is well known, there are action and co-operation.</p>
<p>
[3] Such co-operation exists too, in all the senses; for the organs of sense, like those of motion in the body, consist of fibres, membranes and muscles. To describe the co-operation in each case is needless; for it is well known that light acts on the eye, sound on the ear, odor on the nostril, and taste on the tongue, and that the organs adapt themselves to such action; and thus sensation results. Any one may perceive then, that unless there were in the spiritual organism of the brain such action and co-operation with the inflowing life, thought and will could not exist. For life from the Lord flows into that organism, and as this co-operates, all that is thought, weighed, concluded and determined to be done, is rationally comprehended. If life alone were to act, and man did not co-operate as of himself, he could no more think than the stock of a tree, or than a church building whilst the minister is preaching. He may indeed, perceive something, caused by the reverberation of sound, coming from its doors, as an echo, but not a word of a sermon. <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
This is what man would be like unless he co-operated with the Lord in the matter of charity and faith.<p>

Hic, the subject of the sentence, is masculine referring to homo or minister, and not the templum, a church building. Other translations make church the subject. The meaning supported by the context seems to be: He may hear a church building produce an echo but not a word of a sermon. A church has not the faculty of thought: it can react but not co-operate. </p>

577. Ex his sequitur etiam hoc, quod Dominus continue sit in actu regenerandi hominem, quia continue est in actu salvandi illum, et nullus salvari potest, nisi regeneretur, secundum ipsa Domini verba apud Johannem, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Quod qui non generatur denuo, non possit videre regnum Dei, <a href="3927/john_3_3.htm">3:3</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_5.htm">5-6</a>: est itaque Regeneratio medium salvationis, ac Charitas et Fides sunt media regenerationis. Quod Regeneratio sequatur fidem hodiernae Ecclesiae, quae est absque cooperatione hominis, est vanitas vanitatum.</p>
<p>
[2] Actio et cooperatio qualis descripta est, videri potest in omni re, quae in aliqua activitate et mobilitate est: talis actio et cooperatio est cordis et omnis ejus arteriae; Cor agit et Arteria ex suis involucris aut tunicis cooperatur, inde circulatio: simile est cum Pulmone; aer ex incumbentia secundum altitudinem suae athmosphaerae agit, et costae cum pulmone primum cooperantur, et mox postea pulmo cum costis; inde respiratio omnis membranae in corpore; ita meninges cerebri, pleura, peritonaeum, diaphragma, et reliquae, quae viscera tegunt, et quae intus componunt, agunt et aguntur, et sic cooperantur, sunt enim elasticae, inde existentia et subsistentia; simile est in omni fibra et nervo, inque omni musculo, imo in cartilagine; quod in singulis illis sit actio et cooperatio, notum est.</p>
<p>
[3] Talis cooperatio est quoque in omni sensu, nam sensoria sicut motoria corporis, ex fibris, membranis et musculis consistunt, sed cujusvis cooperationem describere, supervacaneum est; scitur enim quod lux agat in oculum, sonus in aurem, odor in narem, et sapor in linguam, et quod organa illis se adaptent, unde sensatio: quis non inde potest percipere, quod nisi talis actio et cooperatio cum influa vita in spirituali organismo Cerebri foret, non posset existere cogitatio et voluntas; vita enim a Domino in organismum illum influit, qui quia cooperatur, percipitur id quod cogitatur, similiter id quod ibi expenditur, concluditur, et in actum determinatur; si sola vita ageret, et non homo cooperaretur sicut ex se, non posset plus cogitare quam truncus, aut quam templum, cum concionatur Minister; hic quidem ex repercussione soni e valvis ejus potest sentire sicut echo, sed nihil sermonis: talis foret homo nisi cooperaretur cum Domino quoad charitatem et fidem.<p>
