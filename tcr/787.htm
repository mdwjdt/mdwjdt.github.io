787. 这新教会是迄今为止地上存在的所有教会的王冠, 因为它必敬拜一个可见的神, 不可见的神就在祂里面, 如同灵魂在身体里面。 惟有这样, 神与人才有可能联结, 别无他法, 因为人是属世的, 所以会作属世地思考; 联结必在人的思维中进行, 因而在其爱的情感中进行, 当人将神视为人时, 这种情况才会出现。 与一个不可见的神联结就好比将视线与浩瀚的宇宙联结一样, 而宇宙的界限是看不到的; 还好比在海洋中间眺望, 只能看见天空和大海, 也会迷失。 但与一个可见的神联结, 则好比在太空或海洋看见一个人, 这人张开双臂, 将你拥在他怀里。 因为神与人的所有联结, 也必是人与神的相互联结; 除非与一个可见的神联结, 否则这种相互性是不可能的。 在披戴人性之前, 神是不可见的, 在约翰书, 主自己也教导这一点:<p>你们从来没有听见祂的声音, 也没有看见祂的形象。 (<a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">约翰福音5:37</a>) <p>在摩西五经:<p>人见我的面不能存活。 (<a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">出埃及记33:20</a>) <p>但约翰书中提到, 祂披上自己的人性就是可见的:<p>从来没有人看见神, 只有在父怀里的独生子将祂显明出来。 (<a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">约翰福音1:18</a>) <p>同一章:<p>耶稣说, 我就是道路, 真理, 生命; 若不藉着我, 没有人能到父那里去。 你们若认识我, 也就认识我的父。 (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">约翰福音14:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_9.htm">9</a>) <p>主在以下经文中教导说, 与不可见的神联结只能通过可见的那位, 即通过祂:<p>耶稣说, 你们要常在我里面, 我也常在你们里面。 常在我里面的, 我也常在他里面, 这人就多结果子。 (<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">约翰福音15:4-5</a>) <p>到那日你们就知道我在父里面, 你们在我里面, 我也在你们里面。 (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">约翰福音14:20</a>) <p>你所赐给我的荣耀, 我已赐给他们, 使他们合而为一, 像我们合而为一。 我在他们里面, 你在我里面: 使你所爱我的爱在他们里面, 我也在他们里面。 (<a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">约翰福音17:21-23</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>;以及 <a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">约翰福音6:56</a>) <p>经上还教导, 祂与父为一, 为了得永生, 人必须信靠祂。 如前面频繁所说, 救赎取决于和神的联结。 </p>

<p>
787. This new church is the crown of all the churches that have ever existed on this planet because it will worship the one God, who can be seen, within whom is the God that cannot be seen, like a soul in a body. This is the only way we can form a partnership with God, because we are earthly and we think in earthly ways; and such a partnership must be formed in our thinking and then in the desires that belong to our love. This occurs when we think of God as a human being.
<p>Establishing contact with a God we cannot see is like trying to make eye contact with the limitless vastness of outer space, or like being on the lookout in mid-ocean but not being able to see anything but endless sky and sea.
<p>Establishing contact with a God we can see is like making eye contact with a person in the air or on the sea, whose arms then reach out, inviting us into an embrace.
<p>Any partnership between God and us must also be reciprocated as a partnership between us and God, and this second aspect of the partnership is not possible unless we can see God.
</p>
<p>
[2] The fact that we were unable to see God before he took on a human manifestation is something the Lord himself teaches in John: "You have never heard the voice of the Father or seen what he looks like" (<a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>). And in Moses we read that no one can see God and live (<a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). In John we read that God's human manifestation allows him to be seen: "No one has ever seen God. The only begotten Son, who is close to the Father's heart, has made him visible" (<a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>). In the same gospel, "Jesus said, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Those who know me also know the Father, and those who see me also see the Father'" (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_9.htm">9</a>).
<p>As for the point that we form a partnership with the God that cannot be seen through the aspect of him that can be seen, that is, through the Lord - this is something the Lord himself teaches in the following passages:
<p>Jesus said, "Live in me and I [shall live] in you. Those who live in me and I in them bear much fruit. " (<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>)
<p>On that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you are in me and I am in you. (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>)
<p>The glory that you gave me, I have given them so that they may be one as we are one - I in them and you in me, so that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I may be in them. (<a href="3927/john_17_22.htm">John 17:22-23</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>; see also <a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">John 6:56</a>)
<p>See also the teachings that the Father and the Lord are one, and that we have to believe in him in order to have eternal life.
<p>Many times already in this work I have demonstrated that our salvation depends on our forming a partnership with God. </p>

787. This new church is the crown of all the churches which have up to now existed upon earth, because it will worship one visible God, in whom is the invisible God, as the soul is in the body. In this way and no other is God's link with man possible, because man is natural and so thinks in a natural fashion; and linking must take place in his thinking and so in the affection of his love, and this happens when a person thinks of God as man. Linking with an invisible God is like linking the sight of the eye with the expanse of the universe, the bounds of which are not to be seen. Or it is like looking out in the middle of an ocean, when the gaze falls on air and sea and is frustrated. But linking with a visible God is like seeing a man in the air or the sea opening his arms and inviting you into his embrace. For any linking of God with man must also be a reciprocal linking of man with God; and this second reciprocity is only possible with a visible God.</p>
<p>
[2] The Lord too Himself teaches in John that God was not visible before He took on the Human:<p>You have never heard the Father's voice, nor have you seen His appearance, <a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>.<p>And in the books of Moses it says that no one can see God and live (<a href="3927/exodus_33_22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a>). He shows in John that He can be seen by means of His Human:<p>No one has ever seen God; His only-begotten Son, who is in the Father's bosom, He has revealed Him, <a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>.<p>In the same book:<p>Jesus said, I am the way, truth and life. No one comes to the Father except through me. He who knows me, knows the Father, and he who sees me sees the Father, <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_9.htm">9</a>.<p>The Lord teaches that linking takes place with the invisible God by means of Him who is visible, that is, by means of the Lord, in these passages:<p>Jesus said, Remain in me and I in you. He who remains in me and I in him, he it is who bears much fruit, <a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>.<p>On that day you will know that I am in the Father, and you are in me and I in you, <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>.<p>I have given them the glory which you gave me, so that they might be one, as we are one, I in them and you in me, so that the love you loved me with might be in them, and I in them, <a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">John 17:21-23</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>; also <a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">John 6:56</a>.<p>He also teaches that the Father and He are one; and that we should believe in Him to have everlasting life. Salvation is dependent upon linking with God, as has been shown at length above. </p>

787. This New Church is the crown of all the churches that have hitherto existed on the earth, because it is to worship one visible God in whom is the invisible like the soul in the body. Thus, and not otherwise, is a conjunction of God with man possible because man is natural, and therefore thinks naturally, and conjunction must exist in his thought, and thus in his love's affection, and this is the case when he thinks of God as a Man. Conjunction with an invisible God is like a conjunction of the eye's vision with the expanse of the universe, the limits of which are invisible; it is also like vision in mid-ocean, which reaches out into the air and upon the sea, and is lost. Conjunction with a visible God, on the other hand, is like beholding a man in the air or on the sea spreading forth his hands and inviting to his arms. For all conjunction of God with man must be also a reciprocal conjunction of man with God; and no such reciprocation is possible except with a visible God. That before the assumption of the Human, God was not visible, the Lord Himself also teaches in John: <p>Ye have neither heard the voice of the Father at any time, nor seen His form (<a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">5:37</a>). <p>And in Moses: <p>That no one can see God and live (<a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). <p>But that He is visible through His Humanity is stated in <p>John: <p>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath manifested Him (<a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">1:18</a>). <p>And in the same: <p>Jesus said I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no one cometh unto the Father but by Me. He that knoweth Me, knoweth the Father, and he that seeth Me seeth the Father (14<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">:6, 7</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_9.htm">9</a>). <p>That there is a conjunction with the invisible God through the visible, that is, through the Lord, He teaches in the following passages: <p>Jesus said, Abide in Me, and I in you; he that abideth in Me and I in him, the same beareth much fruit (<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4, 5</a>). <p>In that day ye shall know that I am in the Father, and ye in Me and I in you (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>). <p>The glory which thou hast given Me I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one; I in them and Thou in Me: that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in them (<a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">John 17:21-23</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>; also <a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">6:56</a>). <p>It is also taught that He and the Father are one, and that in order to have eternal life man must believe in Him. That salvation depends on conjunction with God has been frequently shown above. </p>

787. This New Church is the crown of all the Churches which have hitherto been on the earth, because it will worship one visible God, in whom is the invisible God, as the soul is in the body. Only thus can there be conjunction of God with man, because man is natural, and consequently thinks naturally; while conjunction must be in thought and so in affection, and this takes place when a man thinks of God as a Man. Conjunction with an invisible God is like the eye's grasp of the universe, whose end is beyond its sight; or like vision in mid-ocean, which falls only on air and water, and completely fades away. But conjunction with a visible God is like seeing a man in the air or on the water, stretching forth his hands and inviting all to his arms. For all conjunction of God with man must also be a reciprocal conjunction of man with God; and reciprocation on man's part is only possible with a visible God. That God was not visible before He assumed the Human, the Lord Himself teaches in John:<p>"Ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape" <a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">5:37</a>;<p>and in Moses,<p>That no man can see God and live, <a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>.<p>But that He is seen through His Human is taught in John:<p>"No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him" <a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">1:18</a> and again,<p>"Jesus saith... I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. He that knoweth me, knoweth my Father...

787. Quod Nova haec Ecclesia sit Corona omnium Ecclesiarum, quae huc usque in terrarum Orbe fuerunt, est quia colet Deum unum Visibilem, in quo est Deus invisibilis, sicut anima est in corpore; quod sic et non aliter conjunctio Dei cum homine dabilis sit, est quia homo est naturalis, et inde naturaliter cogitat, et conjunctio erit in cogitatione, et sic in affectione amoris ejus, et hoc fit cum homo cogitat de Deo ut homine. Conjunctio cum Deo invisibili est sicut conjunctio visus oculi cum expanso universi, cujus finem non videt; ut et sicut visus in medio Oceano, qui cadit in aerem et in mare, et perit; at vero conjunctio cum Deo visibili, est sicut visus hominis in aere seu mari expandentis manus ac invitantis in ulnas suas; nam omnis conjunctio Dei cum homine, erit quoque reciproca hominis cum Deo, et alterum hoc reciprocum non dabile est, nisi cum Deo visibili.</p>
