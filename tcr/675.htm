<p>
675. Circumcision was instituted as a sign that the people of the Israelite church were descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as the following passages show:
<p>God said to Abraham, "This is a covenant with me that you will observe between me and you and your descendants after you. Circumcise every male among you. Circumcise the flesh of your foreskin as a sign of the covenant between me and you. " (<a href="3927/genesis_17_9.htm">Genesis 17:9-11</a>)
<p>The practice of circumcision as a sign of the covenant was later reinforced by Moses (<a href="3927/leviticus_12_1.htm">Leviticus 12:1-3</a>).
<p>Because this sign differentiated the Israelite church from other religions, before the children of Israel crossed the Jordan river they were commanded again to be circumcised (<a href="3927/joshua_5_2.htm">Joshua 5:2</a>). The reason for this was that the land of Canaan symbolized the church and the Jordan river symbolized introduction into it.
<p>For another thing, the children of Israel were given the following command to remind them of this sign once they were in the land of Canaan.
<p>When you have come into the land and have planted some tree for food, you are to circumcise the foreskin of its fruit. For three years it will be uncircumcised to you; it is not to be eaten. (<a href="3927/leviticus_19_23.htm">Leviticus 19:23</a>)
</p>
<p>
[2] The fact that circumcision symbolized and meant rejecting the cravings of the flesh and therefore being purified from evils (which is also what baptism means) is clear from the passages in the Word where we read that the people were to circumcise their heart. For example, in the following passages:
<p>Moses said, "Circumcise the foreskin of your heart. Do not be stiff-necked any longer. " (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_10_16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>)
<p>Jehovah God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants so that you love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and your whole soul, and you will live. (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_30_6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>)
<p>In Jeremiah:
<p>Circumcise yourselves for Jehovah so that he will remove the foreskins of your heart, O man of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, to prevent my anger from going forth like a fire because of the wickedness of your doings. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_4_4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>)
<p>In Paul:
<p>What counts with Jesus Christ is not our circumcision or lack of circumcision but faith working through goodwill and our being a new creation. (<a href="3927/galatians_5_6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>; <a href="3927/galatians_6_15.htm">6:15</a>)
</p>
<p>
[3] This makes it clear, then, that baptism was instituted to replace circumcision because circumcision of the flesh symbolizes circumcision of the heart. Circumcision of the heart also means being purified from evils, because evils of every kind rise up from the flesh; the foreskin means the filthy loves that belong to the flesh. Because circumcision and the washing of baptism have the same meaning, we read in Jeremiah: "Circumcise yourselves for Jehovah so that he will remove the foreskins of your heart" (<a href="3927/jeremiah_4_4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>); and soon after that we read, "Wash wickedness from your heart, O Jerusalem, so that you may be saved" (<a href="3927/jeremiah_4_14.htm">Jeremiah 4:14</a>). The Lord teaches us in <a href="3927/matthew_15_18.htm">Matthew 15:18-19</a> what circumcision and washing of the heart means. </p>

675. Circumcision was instituted as a sign that the people of the Israelite church belonged to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, as is established by this passage:<p>God said to Abraham, This is the covenant with me which you are to keep between me and you, and your seed after you: every male among you is to be circumcised; and you are to circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, to be a sign of the covenant between me and you, <a href="3927/genesis_17_9.htm">Genesis 17:9-11</a>.<p>This covenant, or its sign, was later confirmed by Moses (<a href="3927/leviticus_12_1.htm">Leviticus 12:1-3</a>). Because this church was distinguished from others by that sign, the Children of Israel were ordered to be circumcised again before crossing the Jordan (Joshua, chapter 5). The reason was that the land of Canaan represented the church, and the river Jordan being brought into it. In addition, so that they should remember that sign when actually in the land of Canaan, they received this order:<p>When you come into the land and plant any kind of tree for food, you are to regard its fruit as uncircumcised <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
; for three years it is to be uncircumcised for you, it is not to be eaten, <a href="3927/leviticus_19_23.htm">Leviticus 19:23</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] Circumcision represented and so stood for the rejection of the lusts of the flesh, and thus purification from evils, in much the same way as baptism. This is established from the passages in the Word where it is said that they should circumcise their hearts, as the following:<p>Moses said, Circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and do not be stiffnecked, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_10_16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>.<p>Jehovah God will circumcise your heart and your seed's heart, so that you will love Jehovah your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, so that you may live, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_30_6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>.<p>In Jeremiah:<p>Circumcise yourselves for Jehovah, so that He may take away the foreskins of your hearts, the man of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that my wrath may not go forth like fire on account of the wickedness of your deeds, <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>.<p>In Paul:<p>In Jesus Christ neither is circumcision of any value, nor is uncircumcision, but faith working through charity, and a new creation, <a href="3927/galatians_5_6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>; <a href="3927/galatians_6_15.htm">6:15</a>.<p>These passages now make it plain that baptism was instituted to take the place of circumcision, because the circumcision of the heart was represented by the circumcision of the flesh; and this too meant purification from evils, for evils of every kind arise from the flesh, and the foreskin means its filthy loves. It is because circumcision and baptismal washing have a similar meaning that it is said in Jeremiah:<p>Circumcise yourselves for Jehovah, so that He may take away the foreskins of your hearts, <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>.<p>and shortly afterwards:<p>Wash your heart free from wickedness, Jerusalem, so that you may be saved, <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_14.htm">Jeremiah 4:14</a>.<p>The Lord teaches in Matthew (<a href="3927/matthew_15_18.htm">Matthew 15:18-19</a>) what circumcision and the washing of the heart means.<p>

675. That circumcision was instituted as a sign that the men of the Israelitish church were of the posterity of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, appears from the following: <p>God said unto Abraham, This is the covenant with Me, which ye shall keep between Me and you and thy seed after thee. Every child male among you shall be circumcised. And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin that it may be a token of the covenant betwixt Me and you (<a href="3927/genesis_17_9.htm">Genesis 17:9-11</a>). <p>This covenant, or its token, was afterward confirmed by Moses (<a href="3927/leviticus_12_1.htm">Leviticus 12:1-3</a>). And as that church was distinguished from others by this sign, so before the sons of Israel had passed over Job they were commanded to be circumcised again (Joshua 5); and for the reason that the land of Canaan represented the church, and the river Jordan introduction into it. And furthermore, in order that they might remember that token even in the land of Canaan itself, it was commanded them: <p>When ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruits thereof as their uncircumcision; three years shall they be as uncircumcised unto you, and not be eaten (<a href="3927/leviticus_19_23.htm">Leviticus 19:23</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] That circumcision represented and therefore signified the rejection of the lusts of the flesh, and thus purification from evils, the same as baptism, is evident from the passages in the Word where they are told to circumcise their hearts, as in the following: <p>Moses said, Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and harden not your neck (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_10_16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>). <p>And Jehovah thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, that thou mayest love Jehovah thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_30_6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>). <p>And in Jeremiah: <p>Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, to take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, lest my anger go forth like fire, because of the evil of your doings (<a href="3927/jeremiah_4_4.htm">4:4</a>). <p>And in Paul: <p>For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love and a new creature (<a href="3927/galatians_5_6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>; <a href="3927/galatians_6_15.htm">6:15</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] From all this it is now clear that baptism was instituted in place of circumcision, because the circumcision of the flesh represented circumcision of the heart, which also signifies purification from evils, for all kinds of evil arise from the heart, and "the foreskin" signifies its filthy loves. Because circumcision and baptism have a like signification, it is said in Jeremiah: <p>Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, to take away the foreskins of your heart (4<a href="3927/jeremiah_4_4.htm">:4</a>); <p>and a little after: <p>Wash thine heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that thou may be saved (verse<a href="3927/jeremiah_4_14.htm">14</a>). <p>What circumcision is, and the washing of the heart, the Lord teaches in <a href="3927/matthew_15_18.htm">Matthew (15:18, 19</a>). </p>

675. Circumcision was instituted as a sign that the men of the Israelitish Church were of the posterity of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, as is evident from these words:<p>"God said unto Abraham... This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man-child among you shall be circumcised. And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you" <a href="3927/genesis_17_9.htm">Genesis 17:9-11</a>.<p>This covenant, or the sign of it, was afterwards confirmed by Moses, <a href="3927/leviticus_12_1.htm">Leviticus 12:1-3</a>. As that Church was distinguished from all others by that sign, it was, therefore, commanded, before the Children of Israel passed over Jordan, that they should again be circumcised, <a href="3927/joshua_5_1.htm">Joshua 5</a>. This was because the land of Canaan represented the Church, and the river Jordan, introduction into it. Moreover, that they might remember that sign in the land of Canaan itself, this command was given:<p>"When ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of" <a href="3927/leviticus_19_23.htm">Leviticus 19:23</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] Circumcision, like Baptism, represented and thus signified, the rejection of the lusts of the flesh, and consequently purification from evils, as is evident from those passages in the Word where it is said that they should circumcise the heart, as in the following:<p>Moses said, "Circumcise therefore the foreskins of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked" <a href="3927/deuteronomy_10_16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>.<p>"JEHOVAH thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love JEHOVAH thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live" <a href="3927/deuteronomy_30_6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>;<p>and in Jeremiah,<p>"Circumcise yourselves to JEHOVAH, that He may remove (A.V., and take away) the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my fury come forth like fire... because of the evil of your doings," <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>;<p>and in Paul,<p>"In Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love" <a href="3927/galatians_5_6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>; <a href="3927/galatians_6_15.htm">6:15</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] From these passages it is now evident that Baptism was instituted in place of circumcision, because the circumcision of the flesh represented the circumcision of the heart, which also signifies purification from evils; for evils of every kind arise from the flesh, and the foreskin signifies its polluted loves. Since circumcision and the washing of Baptism signify the same thing, it is said in Jeremiah,<p>"Circumcise yourselves to JEHOVAH, that He may remove (A.V., and take away) the foreskins of your heart" <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>;<p>and a little later,<p>"O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved" <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_14.htm">Jeremiah 4:14</a>.<p>What circumcision and washing the heart signify the Lord teaches in <a href="3927/matthew_15_18.htm">Matthew 15:18-19</a>. </p>

675. Quod Circumcisio fuerit instituta, in signum, quod homines Ecclesiae Israeliticae essent ex posteritate Abrahami, Isaci et Jacobi, constat ex his, "Dixit Deus ad Abrahamum, hoc foedus Mecum, quod observabitis inter Me et inter vos, et inter semen tuum post te; circumcide vobis omnem masculum, et circumcidetis carnem praeputii vestri, ut sit in signum foederis inter Me et vos," <a href="3927/genesis_17_9.htm">Genesis 17:9-11</a>. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Quod foedus seu ejus signum postea confirmatum est per Mosen, <a href="3927/leviticus_12_1.htm">Leviticus 12:1-3</a>. Et quia Ecclesia illa per illud signum a reliquis distinguebatur, ideo antequam filii Israelis transgressi sunt Jordanem, mandatum erat, ut iterum circumciderentur, Joshua V. causa fuit, quia Terra <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
Canaan repraesentabat <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
Ecclesiam, et Jordanes fluvius introductionem in illam: et insuper ut in ipsa terra <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
Canaane illius signi recordarentur, mandatum est hoc, "Quando veneritis in Terram, et plantaveritis quamcunque Arborem cibi, praeputiabitis praeputium fructus ejus; tribus annis erit vobis praeputiatus, non comedetur," <a href="3927/leviticus_19_23.htm">Leviticus 19:23</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] Quod Circumcisio repraesentaverit et inde significaverit rejectionem concupiscentiarum carnis, et sic purificationem a malis, simile quod Baptismus, constat ex locis in Verbo, ubi dicitur, quod circumciderent Cor, ut in his, "Moses dixit, circumcidite praeputium cordis vestri, cervicem vestram ne indurate, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_10_16.htm">Deuteronomius 10:16</a>. Circumcidet Jehovah Deus cor tuum, et cor seminis tui, ut diligas Jehovam Deum tuum, ex toto corde tuo, ex tota anima tua, quo vivas," <a href="3927/deuteronomy_30_6.htm">Deuteronomius 30:6</a>. Et apud Jeremiam, "Circumcidite vos Jehovae, ut removeat praeputia cordis vestri, vir Jehudae et habitatores Hierosolymae, ne exeat sicut ignis ira mea propter malitiam operum vestrorum," <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_4.htm">4:4</a>. Et apud Paulum, "In Jesu Christo neque Circumcisio aliquid valet, neque Praeputium, sed Fides per Charitatem operans, et nova Creatura," <a href="3927/galatians_5_6.htm">Galatas 5:6</a>; <a href="3927/galatians_6_15.htm">6:15</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] Ex his nunc patet, quod loco circumcisionis institutus sit Baptismus, quia per circumcisionem carnis repraesentata est circumcisio cordis, quae etiam significat purificationem a malis, nam mala omnis generis assurgunt ex carne, ac praeputium significat spurcos amores ejus; quoniam circumcisio et baptismi lavatio simile significant, ideo dicitur apud Jeremiam, "Circumcidite vos Jehovae, ut removeat praeputia <sup "fn120_5">5</sup>
cordis vestri," <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_4.htm">4:4</a>et paulo post, Lava <sup "fn120_6">6</sup>
