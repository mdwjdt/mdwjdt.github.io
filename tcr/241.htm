<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>241</b>.在天堂，圣言是以属灵的风格写成的，而属灵的风格与属世的风格迥然不同。属灵的风格纯由字母组成，每个字母都表示某种特定意义。字母之上和之间都有虚线、曲线和点，用来增强意义。属灵国度的天使所用的字母类似于我们世上的印刷体；而属天国度的天使所用的字母在有些情况下就像阿拉伯字母，有些情况下则像古希伯来字母；不过，它们上下弯曲，并且上面、之间和里面标有点。甚至每一个点都包含某种完整意义。这就是天使文字的性质，对他们来说，圣言中的人名和地名都是用符号来表达的，智者能借此理解每个名字的属灵和属天之义。如摩西表示通过他写成的神之圣言，该圣言通常被称为历史圣言；而以利亚表示预言圣言；亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各分别表示主的属天神性、属灵神性和属世神性；“亚伦”表示主的祭司职份；“大卫”表示主的王权；雅各众子的名字，或以色列十二支派表示与天堂和教会相关的各种意义；主十二门徒的名字意义也一样；“锡安”和“耶路撒冷”表示教会取自圣言的教义；“迦南地”表示教会本身；那里约旦河两岸的地方和城市表示属于教会及其教义的各种事物。数字也是如此，天上的圣言词汇中甚至找不到数字，取代而之的是这些数字所对应的事物。由此可见，天上的圣言在字义上类似我们的圣言，同时与其对应；故它们为一。<br />值得注意的是，天上的圣言就是这样写成的，以至于简单人以简单的方式来理解，智慧人以智慧的方式来理解。因为如前所述，字母上面有用来增强意义的曲线和点，简单人注意不到它们，也不了解它们；但智慧人却能留意它们，并照其智慧的程度，甚至智慧的最高程度而赋予它们意义。所有大型社群都有经由受主启示的天使所写的圣言复本，它被保存在他们的圣所中，免得圣言的一点一划在别处被更改。我们世人所拥有的圣言与天上的圣言在这方面很相似，即：在世上，简单人也是以简单方式、智慧人以智慧方式来理解圣言的，只是这种情形发生的方式有所不同。</p>

241. 在天國之中的聖言是按屬靈的文體而書寫的, 與屬世的文體大不相同。屬靈文體由純文字組成, 每個字表示某種特定的意思; 在文字之上,之間或其中, 有破折號,弧線和點, 用以加強意義。屬靈國度的天人所用的文字類似於我們世上的印刷字體; 屬天國度的天人所用的文字在某些情況下像阿拉伯字母, 有些情況下類似希伯來字母, 不過上下有弧線, 字母上面,之間和裡面還用點來標注。
<p>甚至僅僅其中一個點點都表達某個完整的意思。
<p>[2]由於天人當中的書寫有如此屬性, 在他們聖言中的人名和地名是用符號標記等來表達, 這樣使智者能認知每個名字的屬靈和屬天意義。例如摩西代表藉他而出的聖言, 還總體上代表聖言的歷史部分; 以利亞代表聖言的預言部分。亞位拉罕,以撒和雅各各自代表主的屬天,屬靈和屬世神性。亞倫代表主的祭司職份; 大衛代表主的君權。雅各眾子的名字, 也就是以色列十二個支派, 代表天國與教會良善與真理的方方面面; 主的十二個門徒有類似的意義。錫安和耶路撒冷代表教會——從聖言領受的教義這方面來代表教會。迦南地代表教會本身, 其中的地方和城市(包括約旦河兩邊)代表與教會及其教義相關的各樣成分。數字也是如此, 這些數字甚至不會存在于天國的詞彙裡, 取而代之的是數字所對應的內容。從這些事實可得知, 天國中的聖言, 在其文字意義, 與我們的聖言類似, 同時還有對應關係, 於是它們為一。
<p>[3]值得注意的是, 天國中的聖言如此書寫是為了能直截了當地被簡單頭腦的人們理解, 同時能被智者以智慧方式來解讀。正如之前所說, 其中包含許多弧線和記號, 用來加強其意。簡單的人們不注意它們, 也無法識別它們; 但智者會留意到, 並依他們智慧的等級來賦予其意。所有大一點的社區都有一本由主啟示經天人書寫的聖言, 被存於他們的聖所之中, 其中內容不可更改一點一劃。
<p>我們世上的聖言與天上的聖言在這方面有類似之處:簡單的人直白地理解, 智者以智慧來解讀, 只是發生的方式有所不同。 </p>

241. As for the Word in heaven, it has a spiritual style of writing that is completely different from our earthly style of writing. This spiritual writing style consists entirely of letters that have individual meanings. There are also little lines, curves, and dots above, between, and inside the letters to heighten the meaning.
<p>Among angels in the spiritual kingdom, the lettering is like printed lettering in our world. Among angels in the heavenly kingdom, some copies of the Word have lettering like Arabic script, while others have lettering like the script of ancient Hebrew (except that the letters are curved at the top and bottom) with diacritical marks above, between, and inside the letters. Each mark contains an entire meaning of its own.
</p>
<p>
[2] Because the angels have writing like this, the names of people and places are replaced in their Word by special markings. From them the wise understand the spiritual or heavenly thing that each name means. For example, "Moses" means the Word of God that was written through Moses, and in a broader sense the historical Word. "Elijah" means the prophetic Word. "Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob" mean the Lord's divine heavenly quality, his divine spiritual quality, and his divine earthly quality. "Aaron" means a priestly quality and "David" a royal one, both of which belong to the Lord. The names of the sons of Jacob or the twelve tribes of Israel mean different aspects of heaven and the church; the names of the Lord's twelve disciples have similar meanings. "Zion" and "Jerusalem" mean the church's body of teaching from the Word. "The land of Canaan" means the church itself. Places and cities on this and on that side of the Jordan mean different aspects of the church and its body of teaching.
<p>It is the same with numbers. In the versions of the Word in heaven these too are absent. In their places are the things the numbers correspond to.
<p>From all this it is clear that the Word in heaven is similar in its literal meaning to our Word, and it corresponds to it as well. Their Word and our Word are therefore one.
</p>
<p>
[3] It is amazing that the Word in the heavens has been written in such a way that the simple understand it simply and the wise understand it wisely. As I say, there are many curves and diacritical marks over the letters that heighten the meaning. Simple people pay no attention to them and do not know what they mean. Wise people pay more and more attention to them depending on how wise they are, right up to the highest level of wisdom.
<p>In its sanctuary every larger community keeps a copy of the Word written out by angels who were inspired by the Lord, so that the Word elsewhere will not change in the least detail.
<p>The Word that is in our world is like the Word in heaven in that the simple understand it simply and the wise wisely. The mechanism for this is different here, however. </p>

241. The Word in heaven is written in a spiritual style which is quite different from the natural style. The spiritual style is composed simply of letters, each one of which denotes a particular meaning; and there are dashes, curves and points above, between and within the letters, which heighten the meaning. The letters used by the angels of the spiritual kingdom resemble printed type in our world; the letters used by the angels of the celestial kingdom are in some cases like Arabic letters, in others like ancient Hebrew letters, but with curves above and below, and pointing above, between and inside them. Even a single one of these points conveys a complete meaning.</p>
<p>
[2] Since this is the nature of writing among the angels, the names of persons and places are marked in their copies of the Word, so that the wise may understand the spiritual and celestial meaning of each. For instance, Moses stands for the Word of God written through him, what is generally known as the historical Word; Elijah for the prophetic Word; Abraham, Isaac and Jacob for the Lord as regards the celestial, spiritual or natural Divines. Aaron stands for priesthood, David for kingship, in both cases that of the Lord. The names of the sons of Jacob, that is, of the twelve tribes of Israel, stand for various meanings connected with heaven and the church; and the meaning of the names of the Lord's twelve disciples is similar. Zion and Jerusalem stand for the church as regards doctrine learned from the Word; the land of Canaan for the church itself; the places and cities in it either side of the Jordan for various meanings associated with the church and its doctrine. It is the same with numbers; these do not even exist in the vocabulary of heaven, but instead there are the subjects to which the numbers correspond. These facts may establish that the Word in heaven is like ours in its literal sense and at the same time corresponds to it, so that they form one.</p>
<p>
[3] It is a remarkable fact that the Word in the heavens is so written as to be understood straightforwardly by the simple and in a learned way by the wise. For it contains many curves and marks over the letters which, as said before, heighten the meaning. The simple pay no attention to them and do not recognise them; but the wise notice them and give them meanings dependent upon their degree of wisdom even up to the highest. All the larger communities have a copy of the Word written by angels inspired by the Lord, which is kept stored in their shrine, for fear the Word elsewhere should be changed in even a point. The Word we have in our world resembles that in heaven in as much as the simple understand it straightforwardly and the wise in a learned way; but the way this happens is different. </p>

241. In respect to the Word in heaven, it is written in a spiritual style, which is wholly different from the natural style. This spiritual style consists of mere letters, each one of which involves some meaning; and there are lines, turns, and dots over and between the letters, and in them, which heighten the meaning. With the angels of the spiritual kingdom the letters are similar to those used in print in our world; among the angels of the celestial kingdom they are with some like the Arabic letters, and with some like the ancient Hebrew letters, but curved above and below, with marks over, between, and within them; with every particular of these also involving a complete sense.
</p>
<p>
[2] Such being the nature of their writing, with them the names of persons and places in the Word are expressed by signs, whereby the wise are enabled to understand the spiritual and celestial significance of each name, as by "Moses" the Word of God written through him, and in general the historic Word is meant; by "Elias" the prophetic Word; by "Abraham," "Isaac," and "Jacob," the Lord in respect to the celestial Divine, the spiritual Divine, and the natural Divine; by "Aaron" the Lord's priesthood; by "David" His royalty; by the names of Jacob's sons, or the twelve tribes of Israel, the various constituents of heaven and the church, and like things by the names of the Lord's twelve disciples; by "Zion" and "Jerusalem," the church in respect to doctrine from the Word; by "the land of Canaan," the church itself; by places and cities there on either side of Jordan, various things pertaining to the church and its doctrine. It is the same with numbers; in the copies of the Word in heaven these are not found; but instead of them the things to which the numbers correspond. From all this it can be seen that the Word in heaven is in its literal sense similar to our Word, and at the same time corresponds to it; and that they are therefore one.
</p>
<p>
[3] It is a wonderful fact that the Word in the heavens is so written that the simple understand it simply, and the wise wisely; for the letters have over them many turns and markings, which, as before said, heighten the meaning; and to these the simple pay no attention and know nothing about them; but the wise give attention to them, each according to his own wisdom, even to the highest. A copy of the Word written by angels who are inspired by the Lord is kept by every larger society in its sacred repository, that the Word may not be changed elsewhere in the least point. The Word in our world is similar to the Word in heaven in this respect, that here, too, the simple understand it simply, and the wise wisely; but this takes place in a different way. </p>

241. As to the Word in heaven, it is written in the spiritual style, which differs entirely from the natural style. The spiritual style consists of letters only, each of which involves some particular meaning; and there are small lines, curves and dots above and between the letters, and inserted within them, which exalt the sense. The letters in use among the angels of the spiritual kingdom are similar to the letters used in printing in our world; and among the angels of the celestial kingdom they are, with some, like Arabic characters, and with others, like old Hebrew letters, but inflected above and below, with marks above, between and within them, each involving some complete meaning.</p>
<p>
[2] Since the writing of angels is of this nature, the names of persons and places which occur in the Word with them are written with these signs. Thus the wise understand the spiritual and celestial signification of each name; as, for example, that Moses means the Word of God which he wrote, and in a general sense, the historical Word; Elijah, the prophetic Word; Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the Lord as to the Divine celestial, the Divine spiritual and the Divine natural; Aaron, the Lord's priesthood, and David, the Lord's kingship. The names of the sons of Jacob, or the twelve tribes of Israel, signify various things pertaining to heaven and the Church; so also the names of the Lord's disciples. Zion and Jerusalem signify the Church as to doctrine from the Word; the land of Canaan, the Church itself; and places and cities there, on both sides of the Jordan, signify various things pertaining to the Church and its doctrine. It is the same with numbers; these are not found in copies of the Word in heaven, but instead of them, the things to which the numbers correspond. From this it may be evident that the Word in heaven, as to its literal sense, is similar to our Word, and at the same time corresponds to it; and therefore that they are one.</p>

[3] It is a wonderful circumstance that the Word in the heavens is so written that the simple understand it in simplicity, and the wise in wisdom. For there are many curves and marks over the letters, which, as was said above, exalt the sense. The simple neither regard nor understand these; but the wise pay attention to them, each according to his degree of wisdom, even to the wisest. A copy of the Word, written by angels under the Lord's inspiration, is kept by every considerable society in its sacred repository, in case the Word elsewhere should suffer alteration in any point. The Word in our world is like the Word in heaven, in that the simple understand if in simplicity, and the wise in wisdom; but this is effected in a different manner. </p>

241. Quod Verbum in Coelo attinet, hoc scriptum est stylo spirituali, qui prorsus differt a stylo naturali; stylus spiritualis consistit ex meris literis, quarum unaquaevis involvit quendam Sensum, et sunt lineolae, strophae et punctationes supra et inter literas, et in illis, quae exaltant Sensum. Literae apud Angelos Regni spiritualis sunt similes literis typographicis in nostro Mundo; et literae apud Angelos Regni Coelestis sunt apud quosdam similes literis Arabicis, apud quosdam literis vetustis Hebraicis, sed inflexis supra et infra, cum signaturis supra, inter, et intra, harum etiam quaelibet involvit integrum Sensum.</p>
<p>
[2] Quia talis est scriptura illorum, ideo Nomina personarum et locorum in Verbo apud illos signata sunt, inde a sapientibus intelligitur quid spirituale et coeleste per quodlibet significatur, sicut per Mosen Verbum Dei per illum scriptum, et in communi sensu Verbum Historicum, per Eliam Propheticum, per Abrahamum, Isacum et Jacobum Dominus quoad Divinum coeleste, Divinum spirituale, et Divinum naturale; per Aharonem Sacerdotium, per Davidem Regium, utrumque Domini; per Nomina filiorum Jacobi, seu duodecim Tribuum Israelis, varia Coeli et Ecclesiae; similia per Nomina duodecim Discipulorum Domini; per Zionem et Hierosolymam Ecclesia quoad doctrinam e Verbo; per terram Canaanem ipsa Ecclesia; per Loca et Urbes ibi cis et trans Jordanem, varia quae Ecclesiae et ejus doctrinae sunt. Simile est cum Numeris; hi nec in Verbis quae in Coelo, sunt, sed pro illis res, quibus numeri correspondent. Ex his constare potest, quod Verbum in Coelo sit quoad Sensum literalem simile, et simul correspondens nostro Verbo, et sic quod unum sint.</p>
<p>
[3] Hoc mirabile est, quod Verbum in Coelis ita scriptum sit, ut simplices illud simpliciter intelligant, ac ut sapientes sapienter; sunt enim plures strophae et signaturae supra literas, quae, ut dictum est, exaltant Sensum; simplices ad illas non attendunt, nec illas norunt; at sapientes attendunt, quisque secundum suam Sapientiam, usque ad summam. Exemplar Verbi ab Angelis a Domino inspiratis scriptum, apud unamquamque Societatem majorem, in Sacrario ejus, repositum est, ne Verbum quoad aliquod punctum alibi immutetur. Verbum, quod in nostro Mundo est, simile est Verbo Coeli in eo, quod simplices illud simpliciter intelligant, et sapientes sapienter; sed hoc fit alio modo. </p>
