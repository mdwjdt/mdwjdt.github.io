<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第324节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>324</b>.那些出于欺骗或故意说假话的人，会用模仿属灵情感的语气说出假话，如果他们将圣言的真理混进来，更是如此，真理因此被歪曲。这种人被古人称为“巫师”（参看《破解启示录》462节），还被称为“术士”，以及善恶知识树的蛇。这些弄虚作假者、说谎的和骗子们好比那些表面上和蔼可亲地与他们所憎恨的人交谈，背后却藏着一把杀人的匕首之人。他们也好比那些在剑上抹上毒药，从而攻击其仇敌之人。还好比那些将毒药混在水里，或在美酒和甜食中下毒之人。他们又好比将性病传给他人的风情万种的妓女。或好比带刺的灌木，当鼻子靠近去闻时，就刺伤嗅觉纤维；或好比糖衣毒药；或好比在秋天晒干后发出香味的粪便。在圣言中，这类人被描述为豹子（参看《破解启示录》572节）。</p>

324. 有人在口中說虛偽的,刻意欺騙的事情, 並模仿熱愛屬靈的聲調而振振有詞, 甚至從聖言中引用真理來散佈, 因而歪曲了真理, 這樣的人被古人稱為"術士"(參看<a href="../ar/462.htm">破解啟示錄462</a>節), 還被稱為"巫師", 以及善惡知識樹之蛇。
<p>這些假冒者,說謊者和騙子們如同有人溫和友善地與其敵人聊天, 卻從頭到尾背著一把匕首,預備隨時下手殺了對方。他們還像有人在攻擊敵人時將刀劍蘸上毒; 還像人在井裡下毒或在新酒和糖粉中落毒。他們像風情萬種的妓女將性病傳給他人。或者包覆細刺的嫩枝, 當人探鼻去聞時, 細刺傷害到嗅覺纖維。或者像包著糖衣的毒藥。或者像糞便在秋天曬乾後散出舒適的氣味。這類人在聖言中被描述成獵豹(參看<a href="../ar/572.htm">破解啟示錄572</a>節)。 </p>

324. There are people who say false, deliberately deceitful things and articulate them with a tone that emulates spiritual feeling. There are even some who cite truths from the Word as they do so, falsifying these truths in the process. The ancients had names for people like these: they called them magicians (see <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_462.htm">Revelation Unveiled 462</a>) and also sorcerers, and snakes from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
<p>These pretenders, liars, and deceivers are like people who talk in a pleasant and friendly way with their enemies, but while they are talking they have a dagger behind their back, ready to kill. They are like people who smear venom on their swords before attacking their enemies; or like people who put poison in a well and toxic substances in wine and pastries. They are like charming, attractive whores who carry a malignant sexually transmitted disease. They are like stinging plants that damage our olfactory nerves if we lift them to our noses to smell them. They are like sweetened poisons, or like dung dried out in the fall that gives off a pleasant aroma. In the Word they are described as leopards (see <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_572.htm">Revelation Unveiled 572</a>). </p>

324. Those who deliberately or with intent to deceive speak falsehoods, and utter them in a tone which imitates spiritual affection - even more so if they intersperse them with truths from the Word, which are thus falsified - these people were called by the ancients spell-makers (on these see Apocalypse Revealed 462); and also soothsayers and serpents of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. These counterfeiters, liars and deceivers can be likened to people who chat in pleasant and friendly fashion with their enemies, and all the time they are talking hold a dagger behind their backs with which to kill them. They can also be likened to those who dip their swords in poison before attacking their enemies; and to those who mix aconite in water or poisonous substances in new wine and sugar icing. They might also be likened to charming and attractive whores, who are infected with a dire disease, or to twigs covered in prickles, which if put to the nose damage the olfactory fibrils; or to sugar-coated poisons; and to dung which when dried in autumn gives off an agreeable smell. Such people are described in the Word as leopards (see Apocalypse Revealed 572). </p>

<p>
324. Those who speak falsities from deceit or purposely, uttering them in a tone imitative of spiritual affection (and still more if they mingle with them truths from the Word, which are thus falsified), were by the ancients called sorcerers (on whom see the Apocalypse Revealed, n. <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_462.htm">462</a>), also pythons, and serpents of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. These falsifiers, liars, and deceivers may be likened to men who talk to those they hate in a bland and friendly manner, and while talking hold behind them a dagger with which to kill. They may also be likened to those who poison their swords and thus attack their enemies; or to those who mix hemlock with water, or who poison with wine and sweetmeats. They may also be likened to handsome and seductive harlots infected with venereal diseases; to stinging shrubs, which when brought near to the nostrils, hurt the olfactory fibers; to sweetened poisons; and also to ordure, which when dried emits in autumn a fragrant odor. Such are described in the Word by leopards (see the Apocalypse Revealed, n. <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_572.htm">572</a>). </p>

<p>
324. Those who utter falsities from intentional deceit, and in a tone simulating spiritual affection, especially if they mingle them with truths from the Word, which are thus falsified, were called by the ancients enchanters, respecting whom see <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_462.htm">The Apocalypse Revealed 462</a>; and also pythons and serpents of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Such falsifiers, liars and deceivers may be likened to those who converse with their enemies in a courteous and friendly manner, and, while talking, hold a dagger behind their back with which to kill them. They may also be likened to those who dip their swords in poison, and so engage their enemies; or to those who mix hemlock with water, and poison in wine and sweetmeats. They may also be likened to beautiful and seductive courtesans, infected with a foul disease; to stinging plants which hurt the nose of anyone who tries to smell them; to sweetened poison, and to dung which, when dried in autumn, spreads around a fragrant odor. In the Word these are described as leopards, as may be seen in <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_572.htm">The Apocalypse Revealed 572</a>. </p>

324. Illi qui falsa loquuntur ex dolo aut proposito, et illa sono aemulo affectionis spiritualis pronuntiant, et plus si intermiscent vera ex Verbo, quae sic falsificant, ab Antiquis dicti sunt Incantatores, de quibus videatur APOCALYPSIS REVELATA, <a href="462.htm">462</a>; tum Pythones et Serpentes arboris scientiae boni et mali. Hi falsarii, mendaces et dolosi, assimilari possunt illis qui blande et amice loquuntur cum inimicis, et cum loquuntur, a tergo tenent pugionem, cum qua interimant. Et assimilari possunt illis, qui gladios veneno tingunt, et sic aggrediuntur hostes: et illis, qui aquis immiscent aconita, ac mustis et pastis saccharinis virus. Assimilari etiam possunt scortis venustis et allicientibus lue maligna infectis; tum virgultis aculeatis, quae admota naribus fibrillas olfactus laedunt: ut et venenis edulcoratis: et quoque fimis, qui siccati tempore autumni odorem fragrantem spargunt. Tales in Verbo describuntur per pardos, videatur APOCALYPSIS REVELATA, <a href="572.htm">572</a>. </p>
