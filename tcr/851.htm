851. 我预见很多人读了附于本书正文后面的记事后, 会认为它们是想象的臆造物。 但我真的保证它们不是虚构, 而是我真实的所见所闻, 不是在昏昏欲睡的状态, 而是在十分清醒的情况下看见和听到的。 因为主乐意向我显明祂自己, 并差遣我教导启示录中“新耶路撒冷”所指新教会的教义。 为此, 祂打开我的心智或灵的内在, 我借以被允许与天人同在灵界, 同时与世人同在尘世, 这种状况如今已持续了27年。 若不是主开了某个人的灵眼, 指示并教导他, 基督教界有谁会知道有关天堂与地狱的事呢? 记事所叙述的这类事在天上真的发生过, 这一点通过启示录中约翰所看到和描述的类似事清楚可知, 也可通过先知在旧约圣言里所看到和描述的那些事清楚可知。 <p>启示录的例子如下: 约翰看见人子在七灯台中间; 他看见天上的帐幕, 圣殿, 约柜和祭坛; 他看见用七印封严的书卷; 他看见这书卷被展开, 有马匹出来; 他看见宝座周围有四个活物; 从各支派拣选的一万二千; 深渊飞上来的蝗虫, 生产男孩的妇女, 她由于大红龙逃到旷野; 两个兽, 一个从海中上来, 另一个从地中上来; 飞在空中, 有永远福音的天人; 有火搀杂的玻璃海; 掌管最后七灾的七位天人; 天人倒在地上, 海里, 江河, 日头, 兽的座位, 幼发拉底河和空中的碗; 一个女人骑在朱红色的兽上; 大龙被扔在了硫磺的火湖里; 一匹白马; 大筵席; 一个新天新地; 从天而降的圣城耶路撒冷, 城门, 城墙和他所描述的根基; 还有生命水的河, 每月结十二样果子的生命树等等, 全都是约翰看见的, 并且是他的灵在灵界和天堂所见的。 再加上使徒在主复活后看到的一切, 以及后来彼得所看到的 (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_11_1.htm">使徒行传11</a>), 还有保罗的所见所闻; 甚至还有旧约中先知所看到的一切, 如以西结书, 他看见四个活物, 它们是基路伯 (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_1.htm">以西结书1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10</a>章)。 一个新圣殿和新地, 天人用竿量它们 (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">以西结书40</a>-<a href="3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">48</a>章)。 他被带到耶路撒冷城, 看见那里可憎的事, 还被带到迦勒底 (<a href="3927/ezekiel_8_1.htm">以西结书8</a>和<a href="3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">11</a>章)。 <p>类似的事发生在撒迦利亚身上:<p>他看见一个人骑在石榴树中间 (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">撒迦利亚书1:8-11</a>)。 他看见四角; 后来见一个人手拿准绳 (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_1.htm">撒迦利亚书1</a>和<a href="3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">2</a>章)。 他看见一飞行的书卷和量器 (<a href="3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">撒迦利亚书5:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">6</a>)。 他看见两山中间的四辆车和马匹 (<a href="3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">撒迦利亚书6:1-8</a>)。 <p>同样发生在但以理身上:<p>他看见四个大兽从海中上来。 (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">但以理书7:1-8</a>) <p>他看见人子驾着天云而来, 祂的权柄不能废去, 祂的国必不败坏。 (<a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">但以理书7:13-14</a>) <p>他看见公山羊与公绵羊之间角斗。 (<a href="3927/daniel_8_1.htm">但以理书8:1-27</a>) <p>他看见天人加百列, 并和他说话。 (<a href="3927/daniel_9_21.htm">但以理书9:21-22</a>) <p>当以利沙仆人的眼目被打开后, 他看见火车火马围绕以利沙。 (<a href="3927/2-kings_6_17.htm">列王記下6:17</a>) <p>从上述及其它众多圣言经文明显可知, 主来前后, 灵界中存在的这些事物曾向很多人显现过。 那么, 当一个新教会正在开始, 或新耶路撒冷从天而降时, 将是何等的奇迹 (那时, 它们也必能被看到) ? </p>

<p>
851. I foresee that many people who read the accounts of memorable occurrences that follow the chapters are going to believe that I fabricated them out of my own imagination, but I assert in truth that they were not made up. I truly saw and heard those things. And I did not hear or see them when my mind was in some sleepy state; I was in a state of full wakefulness.
<p>The Lord chose to manifest himself to me and assign me the task of presenting the teachings that will be a part of his new church, which is meant by the New Jerusalem in the Book of Revelation. For this purpose he opened the inner levels of my mind or spirit, which allowed me to be in the spiritual world with angels and at the same time in the physical world with people. This has gone on for twenty-seven years now. Who in the Christian world would have known anything about heaven or hell if the Lord had not chosen to open the sight of someone's spirit and show and teach that person about them?
</p>
<p>
[2] The types of things described in the accounts of memorable occurrences are indeed the types of things that appear in heaven, as is very obvious from the types of things seen and described by John in the Book of Revelation, and also the types of things seen and described by the prophets in the Word of the Old Testament.
<p>In the Book of Revelation, the following examples occur. John saw the Son of Humankind in the middle of seven lampstands. He saw a tabernacle, a temple, an ark, and an altar in heaven. He saw a book that was sealed with seven seals. He saw the book opened, and horses that came out of it. He saw four creatures around a throne; twelve thousand people who had been chosen from each tribe; locusts rising up from an abyss; a woman giving birth to a male child and running away into a desert to avoid a dragon; two beasts, one rising up out of the sea, and another out of the land; an angel flying in the midst of heaven who had the everlasting gospel; a sea of glass mingled with fire; seven angels who had the seven last plagues; bowls that these angels poured out onto the earth, into the sea, into the rivers, into the sun, onto the throne of the beast, into the Euphrates, and into the air; a woman sitting on a scarlet beast; a dragon thrown into a lake of fire and sulfur; a white horse; a great supper; a new heaven and a new earth; the holy city Jerusalem coming down from heaven, with details of its entrances, its wall, and the wall's foundations. He also saw a river of living water, and trees of life producing different types of fruit every month. These and many other things were all seen by John when his spirit was in the spiritual world and in heaven.
<p>Similar things were also seen by the apostles after the resurrection of the Lord; for example, the visions that Peter had (Acts of the Apostles 11), and the things that were heard and seen by Paul.
<p>Similar things were also seen by the prophets and recorded in the Old Testament. For example, Ezekiel saw four creatures that were angel guardians (Ezekiel 1 and 10); a new temple and a new earth, and an angel measuring them (Ezekiel 40-48). Ezekiel was brought to Jerusalem and saw abominations there; he was also brought to Chaldea (Ezekiel 8 and 11).
</p>
<p>
[3] Something similar happened to Zechariah. He saw a man riding among the myrtle trees (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a> and following). He saw four horns and then a man who had a string in his hand for measuring (Zechariah 2). He saw a flying scroll and a measuring container (<a href="3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">6</a>). He saw four chariots between two mountains, and saw horses as well (<a href="3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a> and following).
<p>In the case of Daniel, he saw four beasts rising up out of the sea (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a> and following). He saw the Son of Humankind coming in the clouds of heaven, whose dominion will not pass, and whose kingdom will not perish (<a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>). He saw battles between a ram and a goat (<a href="3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8:1</a> and following). He saw the angel Gabriel and spoke with him (Daniel 9).
<p>Elisha's servant saw chariots and horses of fire around Elisha; he saw them when his eyes were opened (<a href="3927/2-kings_6_17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>).
<p>From these and many other passages in the Word it is clear that things of this nature in the spiritual world have appeared to many people both before and after the Lord's Coming. Why be surprised that this is also happening now, when a church is beginning, when the New Jerusalem is coming down from heaven? </p>

851. I foresee that many readers of the accounts of experiences which come at the end of the chapters will think that they are fictions of the imagination. But I declare in truth that they are no fictions, but things I have truly seen and heard; and not things seen and heard in some state of mental somnolence, but in full wakefulness. For it has pleased the Lord to show Himself to me, and to send me to teach the doctrines of His new church, which is meant by the New Jerusalem in Revelation. For this purpose He opened the interiors of my mind or spirit, thus allowing me to be with angels in the spiritual world and at the same time with people in the natural world; and this has continued now for twenty-seven years.<p>Would anyone in the Christian world have known anything about heaven and hell if it had not been the Lord's pleasure to open the sight of someone's spirit, and show and teach him?</p>
<p>
[2] It is quite plain that things of the kind described in the accounts of experiences are to be seen in the heavens from the similar things seen and described by John in Revelation, as well as those seen and described by the prophets in the Old Testament Word.<p>Examples in Revelation are: his seeing the Son of Man in the midst of the seven lampstands; seeing a tabernacle, a temple, an ark and an altar in heaven; the book sealed with seven seals and its opening, and the horses coming out of it; the four creatures around the throne; the twelve thousand chosen from each tribe; the locusts coming up out of the abyss; the woman giving birth to a male child, and fleeing into the desert because of the dragon; the two beasts coming up, one from the' sea and one from the land; the angel flying in mid-heaven holding the everlasting gospel; the sea of glass mixed with fire; the seven angels having the seven last plagues; the bowls which they poured out on the earth, the sea, the rivers, the sun, the throne of the beast, the Euphrates and the air; the woman seated upon the scarlet beast; the dragon cast out into a lake of fire and brimstone; the white horse; the great dinner; the new heaven and the new earth; the holy Jerusalem coming down from heaven, with the description of its gates, its wall and the foundations of the wall; also the river of the water of life, and the trees of life which bear fruit every month; and many things besides which were all seen by John, while he was in his spirit in the spiritual world and in heaven.<p>There are also the things seen by the Apostles after the Lord's resurrection, as well as those seen by Peter (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_11_1.htm">Acts 11</a>) and seen and heard by Paul. There are too the experiences of the Old Testament prophets. For instance, Ezekiel saw four creatures, which were the Cherubim (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10</a>); a new temple and a new earth, and an angel measuring them (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">Ezekiel 40</a> to <a href="3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">Ezekiel 48</a>); he was carried away to Jerusalem and saw abominations there, and also to Chaldaea (<a href="3927/ezekiel_8_1.htm">Ezekiel 8</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">11</a>).</p>
<p>
[3] Likewise it happened to Zechariah to see a man riding a horse among the myrtles (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8-11</a>); four horns, and then a man with a measuring line in his hand (<a href="3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">Zechariah 2</a>); a flying scroll and an ephah (<a href="3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">Zechariah 5:6</a>); four chariots between the two mountains, and their horses (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-8</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">7:13-14</a>); the battles of the ram and the he-goat (<a href="3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_9_1.htm">9</a>). Likewise Elisha's lad saw chariots and horses of fire around Elisha, and he saw them when his eyes had been opened (<a href="3927/2-kings_6_17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>).<p>From these and many other passages in the Word it is established that the things which come into existence in the spiritual world have been seen by many people before and after the Lord's coming. What is surprising then if it happens when a new church is beginning, or the New Jerusalem is coming down from heaven? </p>

<p>
851. I foresee that many who read the Memorable Relations annexed to the chapters in this work will believe them to be inventions of the imagination. But I affirm in truth that they are not inventions, but were truly seen and heard; not seen and heard in any sleeping state of mind, but in a state of full wakefulness. For it has pleased the Lord to manifest Himself to me, and to send me to teach those things which will belong to His New Church, which is meant by "the New Jerusalem" in the Apocalypse. For this purpose He has opened the interiors of my mind or spirit, whereby I have been permitted to be in the spiritual world with angels, and at the same time in the natural world with men, and this now during twenty-seven years. <p>Who in the Christian world could have known anything about Heaven and Hell, had it not pleased the Lord to open the sight of someone's spirit, and show and teach him? That such things as are described in the Memorable Relations do appear in the heavens is made clear by the like things seen and described by John in the Apocalypse, also in the Word of the Old Testament by the prophets.
</p>
<p>
[2] In the Apocalypse are the following: John saw the Son of man in the midst of the seven candlesticks; he saw in heaven the tabernacle, the temple, the ark, and the altar; he saw a book sealed with seven seals; he saw this opened, and horses going out of it; he saw four animals round about the throne; twelve thousand chosen out of each tribe; locusts ascending from the abyss a woman bringing forth a male child, and fleeing into the desert on account of the dragon; two beasts, one going up out of the sea and the other out of the earth; an angel flying in the midst of heaven having an eternal Gospel; a sea of glass mingled with fire; seven angels having the seven last plagues; bowls poured out by them on the earth, the sea, the rivers, the sun, the throne of the beast, the Euphrates, and the air; a woman sitting on a scarlet beast; the dragon cast into a lake of fire and brimstone; a white horse; a great supper; a new heaven and a new earth; the holy Jerusalem coming down out of heaven, the gates, walls, and foundations of which he describes; also the river of the water of life, and trees of life bearing fruit every month; with many other things, all of which were seen by John, and seen when as to his spirit he was in the spiritual world and in heaven. Add what was seen by the apostles after the Lord's resurrection, and later by Peter (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_11_1.htm">Acts of the Apostles 11</a>), and what was seen and heard by Paul; and still further what was seen by the prophets in the Old Testament, as by Ezekiel, <p>That he saw four living creatures, which were cherubs (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a>). <p>A new temple and a new earth, and an angel measuring them (Ezekiel 40:0-48:0). <p>He was carried away to Jerusalem and saw the abominations there, and also into Chaldea (<a href="3927/ezekiel_8_1.htm">Ezekiel 8</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">11</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] With Zechariah like things occurred: <p>He saw a man riding among myrtle trees (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8-11</a>). <p>He saw four horns; and afterward a man with a measuring line in his hand (Zechariah 1-2). <p>He saw a flying roll and an ephah (<a href="3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">6</a>). <p>He saw four chariots between two mountains, and horses (<a href="3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6:1-8</a>). <p>Likewise with Daniel: <p>He saw four beasts coming up out of the sea (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-8</a>). <p>He saw the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, whose dominion shall not pass away, and whose kingdom shall not be destroyed (<a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>). <p>He saw the battles between the ram and the he-goat (<a href="3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8:1-27</a>). <p>He saw the angel Gabriel, and he talked with him (<a href="3927/daniel_9_21.htm">Daniel 9</a>).<p>The servant of Elisha saw chariots and horses of fire round about Elisha, and saw them when his eyes were opened (<a href="3927/2-kings_6_17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). <p>From these and many other passages in the Word it is evident that those things which exist in the spiritual world have appeared to many, both before and since the Lord's coming. What marvel, then, that they should be seen now also, when a New Church is commencing, or when the New Jerusalem is descending from heaven? </p>

851. I foresee that many who read the Memorabilia that are appended to the chapters of this book will believe them to be figments of the imagination. But I declare in solemn truth that they are not inventions, but were truly seen and heard; not seen and heard in some state of the mind when sound asleep, but in a state of complete wakefulness. For it has pleased the Lord to manifest Himself to me, and to send me to teach those things which will belong to His New Church, which is meant by the New Jerusalem in the Revelation. For this purpose He has opened the interiors of my mind, that is, of my spirit; and in this way it has been granted to me to be in the spiritual world with angels, and at the same time in the natural world with men, and this now for twenty-seven years.<p>Who in the Christian world would have known anything of heaven and hell, unless it had pleased the Lord to open the spiritual sight of someone, and to show and teach him?

[3] Something similar happened in the case of Zechariah, who saw a man riding among myrtle trees, <a href="3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8-11</a>; four horns, and afterwards a man with a measuring line in his hand, <a href="3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">2</a>; a flying roll and an ephah, <a href="3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">5:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">6</a>; also four chariots and horses between two mountains, <a href="3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">6:1-7</a>.<p>So also with Daniel, who saw four beasts coming out of the sea, <a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-8</a>; the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven, whose dominion shall not pass away and whose kingdom shall not be destroyed, <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">7:13-14</a>; the combat of the ram and the he-goat, <a href="3927/daniel_8_1.htm">8</a>; the angel Gabriel, and talked with him <a href="3927/daniel_9_1.htm">9</a>.<p>The servant of Elisha saw chariots and horses of fire round about Elisha, when his eyes were opened, <a href="3927/2-kings_6_17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>.<p>From these instances, and many others in the Word, it is evident that those things which exist in the spiritual world have appeared to many, both before and since the coming of the Lord. It is not to be wondered at that they should also be seen now, when a Church is being established, and when the New Jerusalem is coming down out of heaven. </p>

851. Praevideo, quod multi qui legunt Memorabilia post Capita, credituri sint, quod sint imaginationis inventa, sed assevero in veritate quod non sint inventa, sed vere visa et audita, non visa et audita in quodam Statu Mentis sopitae, sed in statu plenae Vigiliae: placuit enim Domino Se Ipsum mihi manifestare, et me mittere ad docendum illa, quae erunt Novae Ipsius Ecclesiae, quae per Novam Hierosolymam in Apocalypsi intelligitur; propter quem finem interiora Mentis seu Spiritus mei aperuit, ex quo mihi datum est in Mundo spirituali cum Angelis esse, et simul in Mundo naturali cum hominibus, et hoc nunc per Viginti septem Annos. Quis in Christiano Orbe aliquid scivisset de COELO ET INFERNO, nisi placuerit Domino aperire alicui Visum spiritus ejus, ac monstrare et docere.</p>

[2] Quod talia, quae in MEMORABILIBUS <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
descripta sunt, appareant in Coelis, constat manifeste a similibus, quae visa et descripta sunt in Apocalypsi a JOHANNE, ut et quae visa et descripta sunt in Verbo Veteris Testamenti a PROPHETIS. In APOCALYPSI sunt haec, Quod viderit FILIUM HOMINIS in medio septem Candelabrorum: quod viderit Tabernaculum, Templum, Arcam, Altare in Coelo: Librum obsignatum septem sigillis, illum apertum, et inde exeuntes Equos: quatuor Animalia circum Thronum: duodecim millia Electos ex unaquavis Tribu: Locustas ascendentes ex Abysso: Mulierem parientem filium masculum, ac fugientem in desertum propter Draconem: duas Bestias unam ascendentem ex mari, alteram e terra: Angelum volantem in medio Coelo habentem Evangelium aeternum: Mare vitreum igne mixtum: Angelos septem habentes plagas septem ultimas; Phialas ab illis effusas in terram, in mare, in fluvios, in solem, in thronum bestiae, in Euphratem, et in Aerem: Mulierem sedentem super Bestia coccinea: Draconem ejectum in stagnum ignis et sulphuris: Equum album: Coenam magnam: Coelum novum et Terram novam: Sanctam Hierosolymam descendentem e Coelo, descriptam quoad portas, murum et hujus fundamenta; tum Fluvium aquae vitae, et Arbores vitae facientes fructus quovis mense; praeter plura, quae omnia visa sunt JOHANNI, ac visa dum quoad spiritum suum fuit in Mundo spirituali et in Coelo. Praeter quae visa sunt Apostolis post resurrectionem Domini, ut quae deinde PETRO, <a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_11_1.htm">Actis Apostolorum 11</a>; tum quae visa et audita PAULO. Praeterea quae PROPHETIS in Veteri Testamento; ut EZECHIELI, quod viderit quatuor Animalia, quae erant Cherubi, <a href="3927/ezekiel_1_1.htm">1</a> et <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10</a>: quod Novum Templum et Novam Terram, et Angelum metientem illa, Cap. <a href="3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">40</a> ad <a href="3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">48</a>: quod abductus Hierosolymam, et viderit ibi abominationes, et quoque in Chaldaeam, Cap. <a href="3927/ezekiel_8_1.htm">8</a> et <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_3.htm">11:3</a>] Simile factum est cum SACHARIA, <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
quod viderit Virum equitantem inter myrtos, Cap. <a href="3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">1:8</a>. seq: quod viderit quatuor Cornua; et dein Virum cum funiculo mensurae in manu, Cap. <a href="3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">2</a>; <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
quod viderit Volumen volans, et Epham, Cap. <a href="3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">5:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">6</a>, quod viderit quatuor Currus inter duos montes et Equos, Cap. <a href="3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">6:1</a>. seq. Pariter cum DANIELE, quod viderit quatuor Bestias ascendentes e Mari, Cap. <a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">7:1</a>. seq: quod viderit Filium hominis venientem in nubibus Coeli, Cujus dominium non transibit, et Regnum non peribit, Cap. <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">7:13-14</a>: quod viderit pugnas Arietis et Hirci, Cap. <a href="3927/daniel_8_1.htm">8:1</a>. seq., quod viderit Angelum Gabrielem, et cum illo loquutus sit, Cap. <a href="3927/daniel_9_1.htm">9</a>. Quod Puer Elisaei viderit Currus et Equos igneos circum Elisaeum, et quod illos viderit, cum oculi ejus aperti sunt, <a href="3927/2-kings_6_17.htm">2 Regnum 6:17</a>. Ex his et pluribus aliis in Verbo, constat, quod illa, quae in Mundo spirituali existunt, apparuerint multis ante et post Domini adventum: quid mirum, quod etiam nunc inchoante Ecclesia, seu descendente Nova Hierosolyma e Coelo.<p>
