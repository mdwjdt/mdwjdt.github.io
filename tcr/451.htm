<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第451节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>451</b>.若不与信结合，一切仁都是假的，而这信是指信一位神，三位一体在祂里面。当今教会的仁爱就是这样的例子，当今教会相信同一位神格中的三个身位，一个接一个，父、子、灵。由于相信三个身位，其中每个身位都独自为神，所以它其实信三个神。仁就依附于这信上，如持守这信之人实际所做得那样，但这仁永远不会与这信结合。依附于这信的仁纯粹是属世的，而非属灵的，故它是不正当的仁爱。众多其它异端的仁爱也一样，例如，那些否认神性三位一体，因而只靠近父神、或只靠近圣灵、或靠近这二者，却不靠近神救主之人的仁爱就是如此。仁不会与这些人的信相结合，即使结合或依附，它也是不正当的。之所以被视为不正当的，是因为它就象不合法的私生子，如夏甲给亚伯拉罕所生的儿子，他后来被逐出家门（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.9.htm">创世记21:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.10.htm">10</a>）。这类仁爱就象不是长在树上，而是嵌在树上的果实；又象与前面的马仅靠驾车者手里的缰绳相连的马车；当马开始奔跑时，它们就将驾车者从座位上拽下来，把马车留在身后。</p>

<p>
451. 所有與信(信一位上帝, 聖三一於上帝之中)不聯合的義, 都是非法之義。當今教會之義便是例子, 當今教會相信依次各有相同神性的三個位格:父,子,聖靈。因為信三個位格, 每一個位格都是憑自己存在的上帝, 這就是相信三位上帝。義能夠被附屬於如此之信(它的支持者們事實上就在這麼做), 但永遠不能聯合為一個整體。這樣附屬於信的義, 僅僅是屬世,而非屬靈之義, 因而是非法之義。
<p>其他許多異端之義也是類似:例如, 那些否定聖三一, 因而僅僅轉向父上帝或聖靈, 或者轉向父上帝與聖靈,卻不轉向上帝拯救者。義不能與這類人的信仰相聯合, 如果勉強相聯, 便是非法之義。
<p>稱之為非法, 因為它是不正當結合的產物, 就像夏甲給亞伯拉罕所生之子, 後來被逐出家門(Genesis 21:9-10)。
<p>這種義就像水果不長在樹上, 而是釘在樹上。就像一駕馬車與前面馬匹只用駕車人手持的韁繩相連, 當馬啟動奔跑時, 將駕車人拽下馬車, 馬車仍停在原處。 </p>

451. All goodwill that is not united to faith in the one God, who has a divine trinity inside, is illegitimate. Take for example the goodwill practiced by the modern-day church, which has faith in three persons of the same divinity in succession: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This constitutes a faith in three persons, each of whom is a self-sufficient god, and thus it is a faith in three gods. Goodwill can be appended to this faith - its proponents have in fact done this - but goodwill can never become an integral part of it. Goodwill that is only appended to faith is merely earthly; it is not spiritual. Therefore it is an illegitimate goodwill.
<p>The same applies to the goodwill in many other heresies: for example, the heresy of people who deny the existence of the divine Trinity and therefore turn to God the Father alone or the Holy Spirit alone, or turn to them both rather than to God the Savior. Goodwill cannot become integral to these people's faith. Whether goodwill becomes integral to those faiths or is merely attached to them, in either case the goodwill is illegitimate.
<p>It is called illegitimate because it is like offspring from an unlawful affair, like Hagars son by Abraham, who was thrown out of the house (<a href="3927/genesis_21_9.htm">Genesis 21:9</a> [and following]).
<p>This kind of goodwill is like fruit that did not grow on a tree but was nailed there instead. It is like a carriage with horses that are attached to it only by the reins in the driver's hands; when the horses start to run, they pull the driver from his seat, leaving the carriage behind. </p>

451. All charity which is not linked to a faith in one God, in whom is the Divine Trinity, is spurious. Such for example is the charity of the present-day church, which believes in three persons in the same Godhead, one after the other, Father, Son and Holy Spirit; and since it believes in three persons, each of whom is God existing by Himself, it believes in three Gods. Charity can be attached to this faith, as in fact is done by those who uphold this faith, but it can never be linked to it. Charity which is attached to faith is merely natural and not spiritual, so it is spurious charity. It is similar with the charity of many other heresies, for instance, of those who deny the Divine Trinity and therefore approach only God the Father, or only the Holy Spirit, or both of these without God the Saviour. Charity cannot be linked with the faith of these people, and if it is linked or attached, it is spurious. It is called spurious, because it springs as it were from an illicit union, like Hagar's son by Abraham, who was cast out of the house (<a href="3927/genesis_21_10.htm">Genesis 21:10</a>). This sort of charity is like fruit which does not grow on a tree, but is pinned on; and it is like a carriage with the horses in front of it attached only by the reins in the driver's hands; and when the horses start to run, they pull the driver from his seat and leave the carriage standing. </p>

451. All charity that is not conjoined with faith in one God in whom is a Divine trinity, is spurious like the charity of the present church, the faith of which is a faith in successive order in three persons of the same Divinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; and being a faith in three persons, each one of whom is a self-subsistent God, it is a faith in three Gods. To such a faith charity may be joined (as has been done by its supporters), but never can be conjoined; and the charity that is only joined to faith is merely natural, and not spiritual, and is therefore a spurious charity. The same is true of the charity of many other heresies, as the charity of those who deny a Divine trinity and thus approach God the Father only, or the Holy Spirit only, or both of these apart from God the Savior. To the faith of such, charity cannot be conjoined, or when conjoined or joined to it it is a spurious charity. It is called spurious, because it is like the offspring of an illegitimate bed, or like the son of Hagar born to Abraham, who was cast out of the house (<a href="3927/genesis_21_10.htm">Genesis 21:10</a>). Such charity is like fruit upon a tree where it has not grown, but has been fastened to it with a needle; and it is like a carriage to which horses are fastened only by the reins in the driver's hands, and when they spring forward, they drag the driver from his seat, and leave the carriage behind. </p>

451. All charity is spurious which is not conjoined with faith in one God, in whom is a Divine Trinity. Such is the charity of the present-day Church, whose faith is in three Persons of the same Divinity in successive order, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. As this is a faith in three Persons, each of whom is a self-subsisting God, it is thus a faith in three Gods. To this faith charity can be adjoined, as has been done in the case of its adherents, but it can never be conjoined; and charity which is only adjoined to faith is merely natural and not spiritual, and consequently it is spurious.<p>It is the same with the charity of many other heresies, as of those whose supporters deny the Divine Trinity, and therefore approach God the Father alone, or the Holy Spirit alone, or both apart from God the Savior. Charity cannot be conjoined with their faith, and if it is conjoined or adjoined, it is spurious. It is called spurious, because it is like an illegitimate child, as the son of Hagar and Abraham, who was cast out of the house, <a href="3927/genesis_21_9.htm">Genesis 21:9</a>. Such charity is like fruit which does not grow naturally on a tree but which has been fixed to it artificially; or it is like a carriage to which the horses are attached only by the reins in the hands of the driver, so that when they set off they pull him from the seat and leave the carriage behind. </p>

451. Omnis Charitas, quae non conjuncta est Fidei in unum Deum, in quo Divina Trinitas est, est SPURIA; quemadmodum Charitas hodiernae Ecclesiae, cujus Fides est in tres Personas ejusdem Divinitatis in successivo ordine, in Patrem, Filium et Spiritum sanctum, et quia in tres Personas, quarum unaquaevis est Deus subsistens per se, ita in tres Deos; cui Fidei Charitas potest adjungi, sicut etiam a fidei istius assertoribus factum est, sed nusquam conjungi, et Charitas modo adjuncta fidei, est duntaxat naturalis et non spiritualis, quare est Charitas spuria. Similiter Charitas plurium aliarum Haeresium, quemadmodum illorum, qui Divinam Trinitatem negant, et ideo solum Deum Patrem adeunt, vel solum Spiritum sanctum, aut utrumque praeter Deum Salvatorem; horum Fidei non potest Charitas conjungi, et si conjungitur vel adjungitur, est Spuria: dicitur Spuria, quia est sicut Proles ex illegitimo toro, velut Filius Hagaris ex Abrahamo, qui e domo ejectus est, <a href="3927/genesis_21_9.htm">Genesis 21:9</a>[, seq]. Talis Charitas est sicut fructus non adnatus arbori, sed ei acu affixus; et est sicut Currus, ante quem Equi non aliter alligati sunt quam per habenas in manibus Aurigae, qui cum excurrunt, trahunt Aurigam e sede, relicto curru. </p>
