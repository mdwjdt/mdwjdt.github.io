<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>341</b>.若认为生活良善、信仰正确之人不会得救，而是神随心所欲地拯救或诅咒祂所乐意的任何人，那会让沦丧之人可以名正言顺地指控神缺乏慈悲与怜悯、甚至残忍。事实上，这等于否认神是神，并断言神在圣言中所说的话毫无意义，祂的诫命无关紧要，或微不足道。<br />此外，若生活良善、信仰正确之人不会得救，那他也可以控诉神违犯了祂在西奈山上用自己的手指写在两块石版上的圣约。<br />从主的话（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.21.htm">约翰福音14:21</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.24.htm">24</a>）明显可知，神不能不去拯救那些照祂诫命生活并信靠祂的人。事实上，凡有宗教信仰和正常理智之人若能认真思考：神既始终与人同在、赋予他生命，以及去理解和爱的能力，那祂必然爱人，并通过祂的爱将自己联结于那些过着良善生活、持守正确信仰之人，那他会对此深信不疑。神已将这一点铭刻在每个人、每个生物之中。一个父亲或母亲会不认他们的孩子吗？鸟会不认它的幼雏，兽会不认它的幼崽吗？连老虎、豹子和毒蛇都不会如此。对神而言，有差别的行为会违背祂所在并照之行事的秩序，也违背祂通过创世而施加于人的秩序。就象诅咒一个过着良善生活并持守正确信仰之人对神来说是不可能的，反过来也一样，拯救一个过着邪恶生活并因此持守错误信仰之人对神来说也是不可能的。<br />第二种情形同样违背秩序，因此违背神的全能，这全能唯有在公义的道路上才能前行，公义的律法就是不变的真理。因为主说：<br />天地废去较比律法的一点一画落空还容易。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.17.htm">路加福音16:17</a>）<br />凡对神的本质与人的自由意愿有所了解的人，都能领悟这一点。例如，亚当有吃生命树的果子或善恶知识树的果子的自由。如果他只吃生命树的果子，神会将他赶出园子吗？我不这样认为。但是，如果他吃了善恶知识树的果子后，神还会留他在园子吗？我也不这样认为。同样，我难以想象神会将已被接收进天堂的天使投入地狱，也不承认被判为魔鬼之人会进入天堂。对神而言，这些事情都不可能，哪怕利用祂自己的全能。关于这些，可参看神性全能相关章节（49－70节）。</p>

<p>
341. 倘若一個活出良善生活並持守正當信仰之人不被拯救, 並且上帝可自由地拯救或詛咒任何一個祂心血來潮時所樂意之人, 那會讓淪喪之人可以名正言順地指控上帝缺乏慈悲與憐憫,甚至殘忍。事實上, 能導致他們否認上帝為上帝, 並斷言上帝在聖言中所說的話毫無意義, 祂所立誡命毫無價值和荒誕可笑。此外, 如果一個活出良善生活並持有正當信仰之人不得拯救, 他們可以控訴上帝違背祂在西乃山上用自己手指寫在兩塊石板上的契約。
<p>從主在<a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">約翰福音14:21-24</a>中所說之話可明顯看出, 上帝不能回避不去拯救那些照祂誡命而活並信祂之人。事實上, 任何一個有信仰與常理之人若細想一下定能證實:這位持續與人同在的上帝, 賜人生命以及去認知和去愛的能力, 必然禁不住去愛人, 並藉著祂的愛與那些過良善生活,持正當信仰之人聯合。上帝已將這點植入所有人以有所有活物之中。父母會不認他們的孩子嗎？鳥會不認它的雛兒, 獸會不認它的崽嗎？甚至老虎,獵豹和毒蛇都不會如此。對上帝而言, 有差別的行為將違背既定的規則(祂在其中, 並按照此規則行事), 也違背了祂藉著創世而植固於人裡面的規則。
<p>因為上帝不可能詛咒任何活出良善生活並持守正當信仰之人; 相反, 上帝也不可能拯救任何活著邪惡生活,因此持守錯誤信仰之人。第二種情形也違背規則, 因此違背了上帝的全能, 這全能唯有
<p>通過公正的方式方可發揮; 公正的律法是不變的真理。因為主說:天地廢去較比律法的一點一畫落空還容易。
<p>任何人略知上帝的本質與人的自由意志, 都能領會這點。例如, 亞當有自由去選擇吃生命樹的果子或善惡知識樹上的果子。如果他只吃生命樹的果子, 上帝有可能將它趕出園子嗎？我想不會。同理, 倘若他吃了善惡知識樹的果子後, 上帝會留他在園子嗎？我想也不會。同樣, 天人一旦被接受進入天國, 上帝就無法將其扔進地獄; 魔鬼一旦受審判, 上帝也不能將其移到天國中去。對上帝而言, 這些事情都不可能, 哪怕利用祂自己的全能。關於這些, 可參看神性全能相關章節(<a href="49.htm">49-70</a>節)。 </p>

<p>
341. If people who lived good lives and believed the right things were not saved, and God could freely save or condemn on a whim anyone he wanted to, people who perished could justly accuse God of lacking mercy and compassion or even of being vicious. Indeed they could deny that God is God. Furthermore they could argue that God said pointless things in his Word and gave principles that were worthless and ridiculous. For another thing, if people who lived good lives and believed the right things were not saved, they could accuse God of violating the covenant that he made on Mount Sinai and wrote with his own finger on the two tablets.
<p>From the Lord's words in <a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a> it is clear that God cannot avoid saving people who live by his principles and have faith in him. Everyone who has religion and sound reason can provide arguments to support this by considering that God, who is constantly with us and gives us life and the faculties of understanding and loving, cannot help loving us and being united to us in love if we live good lives and believe the right things. God has built this into every human being and every creature. Can a father and mother reject their babies? Can a bird reject its chicks? Can an animal reject its young? Not even tigers, panthers, or snakes are able to do this. Doing otherwise would be going against the design in which God exists and through which he acts, and going against the design he built into us at creation.
<p>Now, as it is impossible on the one hand for God to condemn anyone who has lived a good life and has believed the right things, it is impossible on the other hand for God to save anyone who has lived an evil life and has therefore believed the wrong things. This too would go against the divine design and therefore against God's omnipotence, which cannot follow any other path than the path of justice. The laws of justice are truths that cannot be changed, for the Lord says, "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for the tip of one letter of the law to fall" (<a href="3927/luke_16_17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>).
<p>Everyone who knows anything about the essence of God and human free choice is able to perceive this. For example, Adam had the freedom to eat fruit from the tree of life and fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If he had eaten fruit only from the tree (or trees) of life, would it have been possible for God to expel him from the garden? I think not. On the other hand, after he ate fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, would it have been possible for God to keep him in the garden? Again, I think not. Likewise, once an angel has been accepted into heaven, God cannot throw that angel into hell; and once a devil has been judged, God cannot move him to heaven. For God's inability to do either of these things despite his omnipotence, see the part on the divine omnipotence in the first chapter, 49-70. </p>

341. To believe that a person who lives a good life and holds a proper belief is not saved, but that God has freedom to save or damn at His whim anyone He wishes, would enable the person who is lost justifiably to accuse God of lack of mercy and unforgivingness, not to say cruelty. In fact it would amount to denying that God was God, and to asserting that what He said in His Word was worthless and that His commandments were of no, or at any rate trifling, importance. Moreover, if a person who lives a good life and holds a proper belief is not saved, he too can convict God of breaking His covenant which He made on Mount Sinai and wrote with His finger on two tables. It is evident from the Lord's words (in <a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>) that God cannot avoid saving those who live in accordance with His commandments and have faith in Him. Indeed anyone who has a religion and sound reason can convince himself of this, if he reflects that God, who is continually present with man, giving him life and the ability to understand and love, must inevitably love him, and by His love link Himself to those who live a good life and hold a proper belief. This is surely something God has imprinted on every human being and on every living thing. Can a father or mother reject their young children, can a bird reject its chicks, an animal its whelps? Not even tigers, panthers and snakes can do this. For God to act differently would be contrary to the order in which He is and according to which He acts, as well as contrary to the order He imposed by creation on man.</p>
<p>
[2] Now just as it is impossible for God to damn anyone who lives a good life and holds a proper belief, so in the reverse case it is impossible for God to save anyone who lives a wicked life and as a result holds a false belief. This second proposition is also contrary to order, and therefore contrary to His omnipotence, which can only proceed by way of justice; and the laws of justice are immutable truths. For the Lord says:<p>It is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one dot of the law to fall out, <a href="3927/luke_16_17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>.<p>Anyone who knows anything of the essence of God and of man's free will can grasp this, For example, Adam was free to eat of the tree of life, and of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If he had only eaten of the tree or trees of life, would it have been possible for God to drive him out of the garden? I hardly think so. But after he had eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, would it have been possible for God to keep him in the garden? Again, I hardly think so. Likewise I hardly think God could cast any angel who had been received into heaven down to hell, nor admit anyone judged a devil into heaven. Neither of these things are possible for God by His own omnipotence, as may be seen in the section on the Divine omnipotence (49-70 above). </p>

341. Under the belief that the man who lives well and believes aright is not saved, and that God is able freely and at pleasure to save and damn whom He will, the man who is lost may justly accuse God of unmercifulness and severity, and even of cruelty, and may even deny that God is God. He may also claim that in His Lord God has spoken unmeaning things, and has commanded things of no importance, or that are trifling. Or again, if the man who lives well and believes aright is not saved, he may also accuse God of violating His covenant, which He made on Mount Sinai and wrote with His finger upon the two tables. That God cannot but save those who live according to His commandments and have faith in Him, is evident from the Lord's words (in <a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>); and anyone in possession of religion and sound reason can confirm himself in this, when he reflects that God who is unceasingly in man and who gives him life and also the ability to understand and love, must needs love him who lives well and believes aright, and must needs conjoin Himself with him by love. Is not this inscribed by God on every man and every creature? Can a father and mother reject their children, or a bird or beast its young? Not even tigers, panthers, or serpents can do this. For God to do otherwise would be contrary to the order into which He is and according to which He acts, and also contrary to the order into which He created man. Since then, it is impossible for God to damn anyone who lives well and believes aright, so on the other hand it is impossible for Him to save anyone who lives wickedly and therefore believes what is false; this too is also contrary to order, and therefore contrary to God's omnipotence, which can proceed only in the path of justice; and the laws of justice are truths that cannot be changed. For the Lord says: <p>It is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall (<a href="3927/luke_16_17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>). <p>This can be seen by anyone who knows anything about the essence of God, and man's freedom of will. For example, Adam was at liberty to eat of the tree of life, and also of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If he had eaten of the tree or trees of life only, would it have been possible for God to expel him from the garden? I believe that it would not. But after he had eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and will, would it have been possible for God to retain him in the garden? Again I believe that it would not; likewise that God cannot cast into hell an angel that has been received into heaven, neither introduce into heaven a condemned devil. That neither of these can He do from His Divine omnipotence, may be seen above in the section on the Divine Omnipotence (<a href="49.htm">49-70</a>). </p>

341. Where it is believed that the man who lives well and who believes aright is not saved, and that God of His free will and pleasure can save and condemn whomsoever He will, the man who perishes may rightly charge God with unmercifulness, inclemency and even cruelty; he may even deny that God is God. He may also declare that God in His Word has spoken things which are of no importance, nay, even trifling in their nature. Moreover, if a man who lives well and believes aright is not saved, he may also charge God with violating His own covenant, which He made on Mount Sinai, and wrote with His own finger upon the two tables. That God cannot but save those who live according to His commandments, and have faith in Him, is evident from the words of the Lord in <a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>; and every one who has religion and sound reason may confirm himself in this truth when he considers that God is continually with man, imparting to him life and the power to understand and to love; and that He must needs love him, and by love unite Himself to him who lives well and believes aright.<p>Is not this inscribed by God on every man and on every creature? Can a father and a mother reject their children, or a bird its young, or a beast its cubs? Even tigers, panthers and serpents cannot but love their offspring. For God to do otherwise would be contrary to the order in which He is, and according to which He acts and also contrary to the order into which He has created mankind. As it is impossible for God to condemn any one who lives well and believes aright, so on the other hand it is impossible for Him to save any one who lives an evil life and consequently believes what is false. For this again is contrary to order, and equally contrary to His Omnipotence, which cannot proceed except along the path of justice; and the laws of justice are truths, which cannot be changed; for the Lord says,<p>"It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the Law to fail" <a href="3927/luke_16_17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>.<p>Every one who knows anything of the essential nature of God and of man's Free Will may perceive this. He knows, for example, that Adam was at liberty to eat of the tree of Life, and also of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. If he had eaten only of the tree or trees of life, would it have been possible for God to drive him out of the garden? I believe that it would not. But, after he had eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, would it have been possible for God to retain him in the garden? In this case also I believe that it would not. Similarly God cannot cast into hell any angel who has been received into heaven, nor can He introduce into heaven any one who has been condemned as a devil. That from His Divine Omnipotence He cannot do either may be seen above in the section on the Divine Omnipotence, <a href="49.htm">49-70</a>. </p>

Credere, quod homo qui bene vivit et rite credit, non salvetur, et quod Deus possit salvare et damnare ex libero et placito quemcumque vult, homo qui perit, potest jure arguere Deum immisericordiae et inclementiae, et quoque saevitiae, imo negare Deum esse Deum; et insuper quod in Verbo suo loquutus sit vana, et praeceperit talia quae nihili sunt, aut quae nugae sunt; et porro, si homo, qui bene vivit et rite credit, non salvatur, potest ille etiam arguere Deum violationis foederis sui, quod pepigit super monte Sinai, et suo digito inscripsit duabus Tabulis: quod Deus non possit nisi salvare illos qui secundum praecepta Ipsius vivunt, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
et fidem habent in Ipsum, constat ex Domini verbis, apud <a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">Johannem 14:21-24</a>, et potest unusquisque, cui religio et sana ratio est, se confirmare in eo, dum cogitat, quod Deus, qui constanter est apud hominem, et dat ei vitam, et quoque facultatem intelligendi et amandi, non possit aliter quam amare illum, et per amorem conjungere se illi, qui bene vivit et rite credit; estne hoc a Deo inscriptum omni homini et omni creaturae; num potest pater et mater rejicere infantes suos, num avis pullos suos, num animal catulos suos; hoc ne quidem possunt tigrides, pantherae, et serpentes; aliter facere, foret contra ordinem, in quo Deus est, et secundum quem agit, et quoque contra ordinem, in quem creavit hominem.</p>
