337. 得救之信, 是信主上帝拯救者耶穌基督
<p>得救之信在於信上帝拯救者, 因為祂是上帝,是人, 祂在聖父裡面,聖父在祂裡面, 以至於祂們為一。因此, 凡接近祂的, 同時在接近聖父,也就是獨一上帝, 得救之信不是信別的什麼。
<p>我們當相信或信仰上帝之子,救贖者與拯救者, 就是由耶和華所生,經童女瑪利亞所出, 被稱為耶穌基督的那位。這可從祂自己的命令, 以及後來使徒們的話中, 明顯看出。
<p>以下經文可清楚看出祂自己命令當信祂:
<p>耶穌說:"因為我父的意思是叫一切見子而信的人得永生, 並且在末日我要叫他復活"(<a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">約翰福音6:40</a>)。信子的人有永生; 不信子的人不得見永生, 上帝的震怒常在他身上(<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">約翰福音3:36</a>)。叫一切信祂的都得永生。上帝愛世人, 甚至將祂的獨生子賜給他們, 叫一切信祂的, 不至滅亡, 反得永生(<a href="3927/john_3_15.htm">約翰福音3:15-16</a>)。耶穌說:"復活在我, 生命也在我。凡信我的人, 必永遠不死"(<a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">約翰福音11:25-26</a>)。我實實在在地告訴你們, 信的人有永生。我是生活的糧(<a href="3927/john_6_47.htm">約翰福音6:47-48</a>)。我就是生命的糧。到我這裡來的, 必定不餓; 信我的, 永遠不渴(<a href="3927/john_6_35.htm">約翰福音6:35</a>)。耶穌站著高聲說:"人若渴了, 可以到我這裡來喝。信我的人, 就如經上所說:'從他腹中要流出活水的江河來'"(<a href="3927/john_7_37.htm">約翰福音7:37-38</a>)。眾人問他說:"我們當行什麼, 才算作上帝的工呢？" 耶穌回答說:"信上帝所差來的, 這就是作上帝的工"(<a href="3927/john_6_28.htm">約翰福音6:28-29</a>)。你們應當趁著有光, 信從這光, 使你們成為光明之子(<a href="3927/john_12_36.htm">約翰福音12:36</a>)。信他的人, 不被定罪; 不信的人, 罪已經定了, 因為他不信上帝獨生子的名(<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">約翰福音3:18</a>)。但記這些事, 要叫你們信耶穌是基督, 是上帝的兒子, 並且叫你們信了他, 就可以因他的名得生命(<a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">約翰福音20:31</a>)。你們若不信我是基督, 必要死在罪中(<a href="3927/john_8_24.htm">約翰福音8:24</a>)。耶穌說:"當保惠師, 真理的靈來了, 就要叫世人為罪,為義,為審判, 自己責備自己; 為罪, 是因他們不信我"(<a href="3927/john_16_8.htm">約翰福音16:8-9</a>)。 </p>

337. 1. The Faith That Saves Us Is Faith in the Lord God Our Savior Jesus Christ
<p>The faith that saves is faith in God our Savior, because he is divine and human. He is in the Father and the Father is in him; therefore they are one. If we turn to him, we are turning to the Father as well - to the one only God. Faith in any other god does not save us.
<p>We are to believe or have faith in the Son of God, the Redeemer and Savior, conceived by Jehovah and born from the Virgin Mary, who is named Jesus Christ. This is clear from commands that he, and later his apostles, frequently repeated.
<p>The following passages make it clear that he himself commanded us to have faith in him:
<p>Jesus said, "This is the will of the Father who sent me, that all who see the Son and believe in him should have eternal life, and I will revive them on the last day. " (<a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>)
<p>Those who believe in the Son have eternal life. Those who do not believe in the Son will not see life; instead God's anger will remain upon them. (<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>)
<p>So that all who believe in the Son would not perish but would have eternal life. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son so that everyone who believes in him would not perish but would have eternal life. (<a href="3927/john_3_15.htm">John 3:15-16</a>)
<p>Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me will never die. " (<a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>)
<p>Truly, truly I say to you, those who believe in me have eternal life. I am the bread of life. (<a href="3927/john_6_47.htm">John 6:47-48</a>)
<p>I am the bread of life. Those who come to me will never hunger and those who believe in me will never thirst. (<a href="3927/john_6_35.htm">John 6:35</a>)
<p>Jesus cried out, saying, "If any are thirsty, they must come to me and drink. If any believe in me, as the Scripture says, rivers of living water will flow out of their bellies. " (<a href="3927/john_7_37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>)
<p>They said to Jesus, "What shall we do to perform the works of God?" Jesus answered, "This is God's work, to believe in the One whom the Father sent. " (<a href="3927/john_6_28.htm">John 6:28-29</a>)
<p>As long as you have the light, believe in the light so that you may be children of the light. (<a href="3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>)
<p>Those who believe in the Son of God are not judged; but those who do not believe have already been judged because they have not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. (<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>)
<p>These things have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Son of God and through believing may have life in his name. (<a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>)
<p>Unless you have believed that I am [he], you will die in your sins. (<a href="3927/john_8_24.htm">John 8:24</a>)
<p>Jesus said, "When the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, has come, it will convict the world of sin, of justice, and of judgment: of sin, because they do not believe in me. " (<a href="3927/john_16_8.htm">John 16:8-9</a>) </p>

337. I. Saving faith is in the Lord God the Saviour Jesus Christ.<p>Saving faith is in God as Saviour, because He is God and man, and He is in the Father and the Father is in Him, so that they are one. Those therefore who approach Him, at the same time approach the Father, that is, the one and only God, and saving faith is in no other. We are to believe or have faith in the Son of God, the Redeemer and Saviour, who was conceived of Jehovah and born of the Virgin Mary,, and was named Jesus Christ. This is evident from His own often-repeated commands, and later from those of the Apostles. The following passages show clearly that He commanded faith in Himself:<p>Jesus said, This is the will of the Father who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him should have everlasting life, and I should raise him up on the last day, <a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>.<p>He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; but he who does not believe in the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God rests upon him, <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>.<p>So that everyone who believes in the Son may not perish, but have everlasting life. For God so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, so that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life, <a href="3927/john_3_15.htm">John 3:15-16</a>.<p>Jesus said, I am the resurrection and life. He who believes in Me shall not ever die, <a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>.<p>In truth I say to you, he who believes in me has everlasting life. I am the bread of life, <a href="3927/john_6_47.htm">John 6:47-48</a>.<p>I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in Me will never be thirsty, <a href="3927/john_6_35.htm">John 6:35</a>.<p>Jesus cried out saying, If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. If anyone believes in me, as the Scripture says, streams of living water will flow from his belly, <a href="3927/john_7_37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>.<p>They said to Jesus, What shall we do to perform God's work? Jesus answered, This is God's work, to believe in Him whom the Father has sent, <a href="3927/john_6_28.htm">John 6:28-29</a>.<p>So long as you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may be sons of light, <a href="3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>.<p>He who believes in the Son of God is not judged; but he who does not believe has already been judged, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God, <a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>.<p>These things have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Son of God, and so that by believing you may have life in His name, <a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>.<p>If you do not believe that I am, you will die in your sins, <a href="3927/john_8_24.htm">John 8:24</a>.<p>Jesus said, When the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will try the world concerning sin, righteousness and judgment; concerning sin, for not believing in Me, <a href="3927/john_16_8.htm">John 16:8-9</a>. </p>
