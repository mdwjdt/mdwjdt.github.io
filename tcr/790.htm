790. What this church is going to be like is amply described in the Book of Revelation. That book is about the end of the former church and the rise of the new church. The New Jerusalem, all the magnificent things about it, and its future as the bride and wife of the Lamb (<a href="3927/revelation_19_7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_2.htm">21:2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">9</a>) are a portrayal of the new church.
<p>From the Book of Revelation I will quote just the following words, when the New Jerusalem is seen, coming down from heaven. We read,
<p>Behold, the tabernacle of God is with people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people. He will be with them as their God. The nations that are being saved will walk in his light, and there will be no night there. I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, a shining morning star. The spirit and the bride say, 'Come. ' And those who hear, say, 'Come. ' And those who are thirsty, come. Those who wish to, take the water of life freely. Do indeed come, Lord Jesus! Amen. (<a href="3927/revelation_21_3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_24.htm">24-25</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_16.htm">22:16-17</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_22_20.htm">20</a>) </p>

790. There is a full description of what this church will be like in Revelation, which deals with the end of the former church and the rise of the new one. This new church is described by the New Jerusalem and its wonders, and by its being the bride and wife of the Lamb (<a href="3927/revelation_19_7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_2.htm">21:2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">9</a>). In addition I shall merely copy out from Revelation the following: when the New Jerusalem was seen to come down out of heaven, it is said:<p>Behold the tent of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they will be His peoples; He will be their God with them. And the nations which are saved will walk in His light; and there will be no night there. I, Jesus, have sent my angel to you to bear witness of these things in the churches. I am the root and offspring of David, the bright star of the morning. The spirit and the bride say, Come; and let him who hears say, Come. And let him that is thirsty come; and let whoever will take the water of life without payment. Even so come, Lord Jesus. Amen, <a href="3927/revelation_21_3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_24.htm">24-25</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_16.htm">22:16-17</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_22_20.htm">20</a>. </p>

790. What this church is to be is fully described in the Apocalypse, where the end of the former church and the beginning of the new are treated of. This New Church is described by the New Jerusalem, by its magnificence, and by its being the future bride and wife of the Lamb (<a href="3927/revelation_19_7.htm">19:7</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_2.htm">21:2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">9</a>). Besides these I will cite only the following quotation from the Apocalypse: When the New Jerusalem was seen descending from heaven it was said: <p>Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall dwell with them, and they shall be His peoples, Himself shall be with them, their God. And the nations that are saved shall walk in the light of it; and there shall be no night there. I Jesus have sent Mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning Star. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And he that heareth, let him say, Come. And he that is athirst, let them come. And he that wisheth, let him take the water of life freely. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. Amen (<a href="3927/revelation_21_3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>, 24-<a href="3927/revelation_21_24.htm">25</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_16.htm">22:16-17</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_22_20.htm">20</a>). </p>

790. What the nature of this Church will be is fully described in the Revelation, which treats of the end of the former Church and the rise of the New. This New Church is described by the New Jerusalem and by its magnificence, and is represented as the Bride and the Wife of the Lamb, <a href="3927/revelation_19_7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_2.htm">21:2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">9</a>. Finally I shall quote only the following passages from the Revelation. When the New Jerusalem was seen to come down out of heaven, it is said:<p>"Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them, and be their God...

Qualis futura haec Ecclesia, describitur ample in Apocalypsi, ubi agitur de fine Ecclesiae prioris et ortu Novae; haec nova Ecclesia describitur per Novam Hierosolymam, et per magnifica ejus, et quod futura sit Sponsa et Uxor Agni, <a href="3927/revelation_19_7.htm">19:7</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_2.htm">21:2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">9</a>.
