608. It is important to know that there are three heavens and that they are divided up according to three levels of love and wisdom. As we progress in our regeneration we come into fellowship with angels from those three heavens. Because this is the case, the human mind, too, has three levels or areas just like the heavens. (For more on the three heavens and their division according to the three levels of love and wisdom, see <a href="swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_29.htm">Heaven and Hell 29</a> and following; see also the little work Soul-Body Interaction 16-17.)
<p>Here the nature of the three levels into which the heavens are divided will be illustrated only by a comparison. They are like the head, the upper body, and the lower body in a person. The highest heaven constitutes the head; the middle heaven, the upper body; and the lowest heaven, the lower body. In fact, the whole of heaven in the Lord's sight is like one human being. The truth of this has been disclosed to me through firsthand experience: I was given permission to see an entire community of heaven, which consisted of tens of thousands of angels, as one human being. Why would the whole of heaven not appear that way before the Lord? For more on this living experience, see <a href="swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_59.htm">Heaven and Hell 59</a> and following.

[2] This also clarifies how we should understand the well-known saying in the Christian world that the church constitutes the body of Christ, and that Christ is the life within this body. It serves as well to illustrate the point that the Lord is everything to all heaven, since he is the life within that body. The Lord is also the life within the church that exists among people who acknowledge him alone as the God of heaven and earth and who believe in him. (He himself teaches, in <a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, that he is the God of heaven and earth, and in <a href="3927/john_3_15.htm">John 3:15-16</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">36</a>; <a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">6:40</a>; <a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">11:25-26</a>, that we are to believe in him.) </p>

608. It should be known that there are three heavens, distinguished in accordance with the three degrees of love and wisdom, and in proportion as a person is regenerated he is in touch with angels from the three heavens. This too is the reason the human mind is divided into three degrees or levels to answer to the heavens. On the three heavens and how they differ according to the three degrees of love and wisdom, see my <a href="swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_29.htm">HEAVEN AND HELL (29ff)</a> and also the tract THE INTERACTION OF SOUL AND BODY <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
<a href="swedenborg_interaction-of-the-soul-and-body-vickers_16.htm">(16-17)</a>. Here I can only use a simile to illustrate the nature of the three degrees which distinguish the heavens. They are like the head, trunk and feet in the human body. The highest heaven makes up the head, the middle heaven the trunk, the lowest the feet. For the whole of heaven is in the Lord's sight like one human being. I have had the truth of this revealed to me by seeing for myself, for I have been permitted to see a community in heaven containing thousands all at one time looking like a single human being. Why then should not the whole of heaven look like this to the Lord? On this direct experience see my book <a href="swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_59.htm">HEAVEN AND HELL (59ff).</a> </p>
<p>
[2] This too makes it plain how we must understand the fact well known in the Christian world, that the church makes up the Body of Christ, and that Christ is the life of that body. It will also serve as an illustration of the fact that the Lord is the all in all of heaven, since He is the life in that body. Likewise the Lord is the church for those who acknowledge Him alone as the God of heaven and earth and believe in Him. He Himself teaches that He is the God of heaven and earth (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>); and that He is to be believed in (<a href="3927/john_3_15.htm">John 3:15-16</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">36</a>; <a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">6:40</a>; <a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">11:25-26</a>).<p>

608. It must be known that there are three heavens, and these distinct from each other according to the three degrees of love and wisdom, and that man is in communion with the angels of those three heavens in the measure of his regeneration; and this being so, that the human mind is divided into three degrees or regions in accord with the heavens. But on these three heavens and their division in accordance with the three degrees of love and wisdom, see the work on Heaven and Hell (n. <a href="swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_29.htm">29</a> seq.); and also the pamphlet on . Here it will be sufficient merely to illustrate, by a simile, the nature of the three degrees in accordance with which the heavens are divided. They are like the head, body, and feet in man; the highest heaven constituting the head, the middle the body, and the lowest the feet; for the whole heaven is before the Lord like one man. The truth of this has been disclosed to me by actual observation, for it has been granted me to see wholly as one man a single society of heaven, which consisted of thousands. Why then should not the whole heaven so appear to the Lord? Respecting this living experience, see the work on Heaven and Hell (n. <a href="swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_59.htm">59</a>seq.). This makes clear what is meant by this, which is well known in the Christian world, that the church constitutes the body of Christ, and that Christ is the life of that body. And this also is thus made clear, namely, that the Lord is the all in all things of heaven, since He is the life of that body. Likewise, the Lord is the church with those who acknowledge Him alone as the God of heaven and earth, and believe in Him. That He is the God of heaven and earth, He Himself teaches in <a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a><a href="3927/john_3_15.htm">; and that men ought to believe in Him, in John 3:15-16</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">36</a>; <a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">6:40</a>; <a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">11:25-26</a>). </p>

608. It should be known that there are three heavens, distinct from one another according to the three degrees of love and wisdom; and that a man, according to the stage of his regeneration, is in communion with angels of those three heavens; and that this is the reason why the human mind is distinguished into three degrees or regions, according to the heavens. Concerning those three heavens, and their distinction according to the three degrees of love and wisdom, more may be seen in the book, <a href="swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_29.htm">Heaven and Hell 29</a> and following numbers, and also in the small work, <a href="swedenborg_interaction-of-the-soul-and-body-vickers_16.htm">The Intercourse between the Soul and the Body 16-17</a>. At this point the nature of the three degrees according to which the heavens are distinguished will only be illustrated by a comparison. They are like the head, the body and the feet in a man, the highest heaven forming the head, the middle the body, and the lowest the feet; for the whole heaven is in the Lord's sight as one man. That this is so, has been made known to me from my own observation; for it was granted me to see one society of heaven, which consisted of ten thousand, as one man. Why, then, should not the whole heaven so appear to the Lord? Concerning this actual experience, see <a href="swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_59.htm">Heaven and Hell 59</a>, and following numbers.<p>It is, therefore, evident how this truth, acknowledged throughout the Christian world, is to be understood, that the Church constitutes the body of Christ, and that Christ is the life of that body. It may also serve to illustrate that the Lord is the All-in-all of heaven, for He is the life in that body. Similarly, the Lord is the Church with those who acknowledge Him alone to be God of heaven and earth, and believe on Him. That He is the God of heaven and earth, He Himself teaches in <a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>; and that all men ought to believe on Him, in <a href="3927/john_3_15.htm">John 3:15</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">36</a>; <a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">6:40</a>; <a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">11:25</a>, <a href="3927/john_11_28.htm">28</a>. </p>
