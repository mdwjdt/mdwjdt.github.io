<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>298</b>.就属灵之义而言，神之名表示教会通过圣言所教导的一切，主借此被呼求和敬拜。所有这类事物综括起来就是神之名。因此，“妄称神之名”表示将这类事物引入无聊的闲谈、假话、谎言、诅咒、巫术或咒语中。这也是辱骂和亵渎神和祂的名。以下经文表明，圣言和教会从圣言所汲取的一切，因而一切敬拜，都是神之名：<br />从日出之地，我名将被呼求。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.25.htm">以赛亚书41:25</a>）<br />从日出之地到日落之处，我的名在各邦中必尊为大。在各处，必向我名焚香。你们却亵渎我的名，说：“耶和华的桌子是污秽的。”然而，当你们把抢夺的、瘸腿的、有病的拿来献上为祭时，对我的名嗤之以鼻。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛1.11.htm">玛拉基书1:11</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛1.13.htm">13</a>）<br />万民各奉自己神之名而行，我们却奉耶和华我们神之名而行。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥4.5.htm">弥迦书4:5</a>）<br />耶和华立祂名之处，他们当在那里敬拜祂。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.5.htm">申命记12:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.2.htm">16:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.16.htm">16</a>）<br />祂的名表示祂的敬拜。<br />耶稣说：“哪里有两三个人奉我的名聚集，那里就有我在他们中间” 。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.20.htm">马太福音18:20</a>）<br />凡接待祂的，就是信祂名的人，祂就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.12.htm">约翰福音1:12</a>）<br />不信的，罪已经定了，因为他不信神独生子的名。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.18.htm">约翰福音3:18</a>）信了祂，就可以因祂的名得生命（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.31.htm">约翰福音20:31</a>）<br />耶稣说：“我已将祢的名指示他们，还可指示他们”。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.26.htm">约翰福音17:26</a>）主说：“我在撒狄有几个名”。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.4.htm">启示录3:4</a>）<br />还有很多其它类似经文，其中神之名表示从神发出的神性，祂藉此被敬拜。而耶稣基督之名则表示整个救赎，祂的整个教导，因而整个救恩。“耶稣”表示藉着救赎的整个救恩；“基督”表示藉着其教导的整个救恩。</p>

298. 就屬靈意義而言, 上帝之名代表教會以聖言為基礎所教導的一切事物, 通過這些,主被呼求和敬拜。所有這些內容的匯總, 都是上帝之名。因此, 妄稱上帝之名表示濫用任何此類事物——濫用於無聊閒談,謊言,欺詐,詛咒,巫術,魔法咒語中。這也是譭謗和褻瀆上帝, 因而譭謗褻瀆祂的名。
<p>從下列經句中, 可看出教會之中或任何敬拜中所使用的聖言以及源於聖言的任何事物, 都是上帝之名:從日出之地, 我名將被呼求(<a href="3927/isaiah_41_25.htm">以賽亞書41:25</a>)。從日出之地到日落之處, 我的名在各邦中必尊為大。在各處, 必向我名焚香。你們卻褻瀆我的名, 說:"耶和華的桌子是污穢的。"然而, 當你們把搶奪的,瘸腿的,有病的拿來獻上為祭時, 對我的名嗤之以鼻(<a href="3927/malachi_1_11.htm">瑪拉基書1:11-13</a>)。萬民各奉自己上帝之名而行, 我們卻奉耶和華我們上帝之名而行(<a href="3927/micah_4_5.htm">彌迦書4:5</a>)。耶和華立祂名之處, 他們當在那裡敬拜祂(<a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_5.htm">申命記12:5</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_13.htm">13-14</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_16_2.htm">16:2</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_16_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_16_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_16_15.htm">15-16</a>)(意思是, 耶和華將在那裡設立他們對祂的敬拜。)。耶穌說:"哪裡有兩三個人奉我的名聚集, 那裡就有我在他們中間"(<a href="3927/matthew_18_20.htm">馬太福音18:20</a>)。凡接待祂的, 就是信祂名的人, 祂就賜他們權柄, 作上帝的兒女(<a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">約翰福音1:12</a>)。不信的, 罪已經定了, 因為他不信上帝獨生子的名(<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">約翰福音3:18</a>)。信了祂, 就可以因祂的名得生命(<a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">約翰福音20:31</a>)。耶穌說:"我已將禰的名指示他們, 還可指示他們"(<a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">約翰福音17:26</a>)。主說:"我在撒狄有幾個名"(<a href="3927/revelation_3_4.htm">啟示錄3:4</a>)。
<p>還有一些類似的表達, 其中上帝之名表示從上帝發出的神性品質, 藉此祂受敬拜。而耶穌基督之名則表示關於祂救贖人類的全部, 以及關於祂教導的全部。"耶穌"表示祂通過救贖而完成拯救人類的一切努力; "基督"表示祂藉著教導來拯救人類的所有努力。 </p>

298. In the spiritual meaning, the name of God stands for everything that the church teaches on the basis of the Word - everything through which the Lord is called on and worshiped. Taken together, all these are names for God. Taking God's name in vain, then, means misusing any of these things for idle chatter, lies, deceptions, curses, sorcery, or magic spells. This too is abusing and blaspheming God, and therefore his name.
<p>From the following passages you can see that the Word and anything from it that is used in the church or in any worship is God's name:
<p>From the rising of the sun my name will be invoked. (<a href="3927/isaiah_41_25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a>)
<p>From the rising of the sun to the setting of it, great is my name among the nations. In every place incense is offered to my name. But you desecrate my name when you say, "Jehovah's table is defiled. " And you sneeze at my name when you bring offerings that are stolen, lame, and sick. (<a href="3927/malachi_1_11.htm">Malachi 1:11-13</a>)
<p>All peoples walk in the name of their God; we walk in the name of Jehovah our God. (<a href="3927/micah_4_5.htm">Micah 4:5</a>)
<p>They are to worship Jehovah in one place, the place where he will put his name (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_13.htm">13-14</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_16_2.htm">16:2</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_16_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_16_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_16_15.htm">15-16</a>),
<p>that is, where Jehovah will locate their worship of him.
<p>Jesus said, "Where two or three are gathered together in my name, I am there in the midst of them. " (<a href="3927/matthew_18_20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>)
<p>As many as received him, he gave them power to be children of God, if they believed in his name. (<a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>)
<p>Those who do not believe have already been judged because they have not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. (<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>)
<p>Those who believe will have life in his name. (<a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>)
<p>Jesus said, "I have revealed your name to people and have made your name known to them. " (<a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">John 17:26</a>)
<p>The Lord said, "You have a few names in Sardis. " (<a href="3927/revelation_3_4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>)
<p>There are also many passages similar to these in which the name of God means the divine quality which radiates from God and through which he is worshiped.
<p>The name of Jesus Christ, however, means everything related to his redeeming humankind and everything related to his teaching, and therefore everything through which he saves. "Jesus" means all his efforts to save the human race through redemption; "Christ" means all his efforts to save the human race through teaching. </p>

298. In the spiritual sense the name of God means the whole of the church's teaching taken from the Word, and through which the Lord is invoked and worshipped. All of this is summed up in the name of God. Therefore taking the name of God in vain means using anything from this source in idle talk, false statements, lies, curses, witchcraft and spells; for this too is slandering and blaspheming God, and so His name. The following passages will show that the Word and all the church takes from it, and so all worship, is the name of God.<p>From the rising of the sun men shall call upon my name, <a href="3927/isaiah_41_25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a> <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
.<p>From the rising of the sun to its setting, great is my name among the nations, and in every place incense is offered to my name.

The name of Jesus Christ, however, means the whole of redemption, and the whole of His teaching, and so the whole of salvation. Jesus means the whole of salvation by means of redemption; Christ the whole of salvation by means of His teaching.<p>

298. In the spiritual sense, the name of God means everything which the church teaches from the Word, and by which the Lord is invoked and worshiped. All such things in the complex are the name of God. "To take the name of God in vain," means, therefore, to introduce any of these things into frivolous conversation, into false speaking, lying, imprecations, juggleries or incantations; for this too is reviling and blaspheming God, thus His name. That the Word and whatever the church has from it, and thus all worship, is the name of God, can be seen from the following passages: <p>From the rising of the sun My name shall be invoked (<a href="3927/isaiah_41_25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_26_8.htm">26:8</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_26_13.htm">13</a>). <p>From the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, My name is great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense is offered unto My name. But ye profane My name in that ye say, 'The table of Jehovah is polluted; and ye snuff at My name, in that ye bring that which is torn, and the lame, and the sick (<a href="3927/malachi_1_11.htm">Malachi 1:11-13</a>).' <p>All peoples walk each in the name of its God; but we, let us walk in the name of Jehovah our God (<a href="3927/micah_4_5.htm">Micah 4:5</a>). <p>They were to worship Jehovah in one place where He would place His name (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_13.htm">13, 14</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_16_2.htm">16:2</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_16_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_16_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_16_15.htm">18</a>, that is, where He would establish His worship. <p>Jesus said, Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them (<a href="3927/matthew_18_20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>). <p>As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become sons of God, even to them that believe in His name (<a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>). <p>He that believeth not hath been judged already, because be hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God (<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>). <p>Those who believe shall have life in His name (<a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>). <p>Jesus said, I have manifested Thy name to men and I have made known unto them Thy name (<a href="3927/john_17_6.htm">John 17:6</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>). <p>The Lord said, Thou hast a few names in Sardis (<a href="3927/revelation_3_4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>); <p>besides many other passages in which, as in the foregoing, the "name of God" means the Divine that goes forth from God, and by which He is worshiped. But the name Jesus Christ means everything of redemption, and everything of His doctrine, and thus everything of salvation, "Jesus" meaning every thing of salvation through redemption, and "Christ" everything of salvation through His doctrine. </p>

All those things collectively are the name of God. Therefore, to take the name of God in vain means to use any of those things in idle talk, in false assertions, lies, curses, sorcery, and incantations; for this also is to revile and blaspheme God, and consequently His name.
