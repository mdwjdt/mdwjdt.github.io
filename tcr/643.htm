<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第6节  存在报应，但它是善与恶的报应，同时也是信的报应</h4><br />643.通过圣言的大量经文（其中部分已被引用）显而易见，存在一个善与恶的报应，这才是圣言所说的报应。但为了确保每个人都能肯定不存在其它报应，我在此必须引用更多的圣言经文：<br />人子要降临，那时候，他要照各人的行为报应各人。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.27.htm">马太福音16:27</a>）<br />行善的，复活得生；作恶的，复活定罪。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.29.htm">约翰福音5:29</a>）<br />案卷展开了，就是生命册，所有人都照各人所行的受审判。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.12.htm">启示录20:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.13.htm">13</a>）<br />看哪，我必快来！赏罚在我，要照各人所行的报应他。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.12.htm">启示录22:12</a>）<br />我必因他们所行的惩罚他们，照他们所做的报应他们。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.9.htm">何西阿书4:9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚1.6.htm">撒迦利亚书1:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.14.htm">耶利米书25:14</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.19.htm">32:19</a>）<br />显他公义审判的日子来到，神他必照各人的行为报应各人。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/罗2.5.htm">罗马书2:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/罗2.6.htm">6</a>）<br />因为我们众人，必要在基督台前显露出来，叫各人按着本身所行的，或善或恶受报。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/林后5.10.htm">哥林多后书5:10</a>）<br />在教会初期，并不存在关于报应的其它律法，在其终结时也不存在关于它的其它律法。教会初期并不存在关于报应的其它律法，这一点通过亚当及其妻子明显可知，他们被诅咒就是因为他们行恶，吃了善恶知识树的果子（创世记2，3章）。教会终结之时也不会存在关于报应的其它律法，这一点从主的这些话明显可知：<br />当人子在他荣耀里，要坐在他荣耀的宝座上；祂要向右边的绵羊说，这蒙我父赐福的，可来承受那创世以来为你们所预备的国；因为我饿了，你们给我吃；渴了，你们给我喝；我作客旅，你们留我住；我赤身露体，你们给我穿；我病了，你们看顾我；我在监里，你们来看我。但对左边的山羊说，因为他们没有行善，祂说，离开我，进入那为魔鬼和他的使者所预备的永火里去！（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.31.htm">马太福音25:31</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.41.htm">41</a>）<br />凡睁开双眼的人，谁不能由此明白善与恶会被报应。<br />也存在信的报应，因为仁属于善，信属于真，二者一起居于善行中，否则行为不是善，可查看373－377节。故，雅各书说：<br />我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕把他儿子以撒献在坛上，岂不是因行为称义吗？可见信心是与他的行为并行，而且信心因着行为才得成全。这就应验经上所说：“亚伯拉罕信神，这就算为他的义。”他又得称为神的朋友（<a href="http://39-27.cn/雅2.21.htm">2:21</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/雅2.23.htm">23</a>）。</p>

643. There Is an Assigning of Spiritual Credit, but in Addition to Whether We Have Faith, It Also Takes into Account Whether Our Actions Have Been Good or Evil
<p>We are assigned spiritual credit or blame [after death] depending on whether our actions have been good or evil. The Word teaches this in countless passages. Some such passages have indeed been quoted earlier, but to show for certain that no other "assigning" than this is meant, some passages like this will also be given here, as follows.
<p>The Son of Humankind is going to come. Then he will repay all according to their deeds. (<a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>)
<p>Those who have done good things will depart into a resurrection of life; those who have done evil things will depart into a resurrection of judgment. (<a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>)
<p>A book is opened, which is the book of life, and all are judged according to their works. (<a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>)
<p>Behold, I am coming quickly, and my reward is with me to give to all according to their work. (<a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>)
<p>I will bring judgment upon them according to their ways and will reward them for their works. (<a href="3927/hosea_4_9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">32:19</a>)
<p>In the day of his anger and just judgment, God will repay all according to their works. (<a href="3927/romans_2_5.htm">Romans 2:5-6</a>)
<p>It is right for us all to appear before Christ's judgment seat, so that each of us may carry away what we have done through our body in regard to those things, whether good or evil. (<a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>)
</p>
<p>
[2] When the church first began, this was the only principle governing the assignment of spiritual credit or blame. When the church comes to an end, this will still be the only principle. We see from the story of Adam and his wife that this was the principle operative when the church first began. Adam and Eve were condemned because they did something evil: they ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 2-3). We see from the following words of the Lord that exactly the same principle will still be in effect at the end of the church:
<p>When the Son of Humankind comes in the glory of his Father, then he will sit on the throne of his glory and say to the sheep on the right, "Come, you who are blessed, and possess as your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the founding of the world; because I was hungry and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and you took me in. I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me. " But to the goats on the left, who had not done good things, he said, "Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels. " (<a href="3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a> and following)
<p>From this statement, anyone with open eyes can see that we are assigned spiritual credit or blame [after death] based on whether our actions were good or evil.
</p>
<p>
[3] We are indeed assigned credit for having faith, provided genuine goodwill and true faith work together in us to produce good actions. As we have seen, if our actions are not the result of both goodwill and faith, they are not actually good; see 373-377 above. Therefore James says:
<p>Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered his son on the altar? Do you see that faith was working together with works, and because of its works faith was recognized as perfect? And the Scripture was fulfilled, which says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as something just. " (<a href="3927/james_2_21.htm">James 2:21-23</a>) </p>

<p>
643. VI. There is imputation but it is of good and evil, and at the same time of faith.<p>It is imputation of good and evil which is to be understood where this is mentioned in the Word. This is established by countless passages there, some of which have already been quoted; but to ensure that everyone can be certain that there is no other kind of imputation, I shall cite here some more from the Word.<p>The Son of Man is to come, and He will then deal with each according to his deeds, <a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>.<p>Those who have done good deeds will go forth to be resurrected to life, but those who have done wicked deeds to be resurrected to judgment, <a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>.<p>The book was opened, which is the book of life; and all were judged in accordance with their deeds, <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>.<p>Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, so that I may give to each according to what he has done, <a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>.<p>I will punish his behaviour, his deeds I will repay him, <a href="3927/hosea_4_9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">32:19</a>.<p>On the day of wrath and righteous judgment God will render to each in accordance with his deeds, <a href="3927/romans_2_5.htm">Romans 2:5-6</a>.<p>We must all be put on show before the tribunal of Christ so that each may be rewarded for his bodily acts, whether good or ill. <a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] There was no other rule governing imputation at the beginning of the church, and there will be no other at its end. The beginning is plain from Adam and his wife, who were condemned for doing evil, by eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Genesis, chapters 2-3). It is plain from these words spoken by the Lord that it will be no different at the end of the church.<p>When the Son of Man comes in His <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
glory, He will sit upon His throne of His glory. And He will say to the sheep on the right, Come, blessed ones, and take possession as an inheritance of the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; I was a stranger and you took me in; I was naked and you clothed me; I was sick and you visited me; I was in prison and you came to me. But He said to the goats on the left because they had not done good deeds, Begone from me, accursed people, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels, <a href="3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>ff<p>Anyone who has his eyes open can see from this that good and evil are imputed.</p>
<p>
[3] There is also imputation of faith, because charity, which relates to good, and faith, which relates to truth, are together in good deeds. If they are not together, then the deeds are not good, see above 373-377. James therefore says:<p>Was not Abraham our father justified by his deeds, when he offered his son upon the altar? Do you not see that faith co-operated with deeds, and by its deeds his faith was recognised as perfect? And the scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and this was imputed to him for righteousness, <a href="3927/james_2_21.htm">James 2:21-23</a>.<p>

<p>
643. VI. THERE IS AN IMPUTATION, BUT IT IS AN IMPUTATION OF GOOD AND EVIL, AND AT THE SAME TIME OF FAITH. <p>From numerous passages in the Word, which in part have been already quoted, it is evident that there is an imputation of good and evil, which is the imputation meant in the word where it is mentioned. But that everyone may feel certain that there is no other imputation, some passages from the Word shall be offered also, as follows: <p>The Son of man shall come, and then He shall render unto everyone according to his deeds (<a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>). <p>They shall come forth, they that have done goods into the resurrection of life, and they that have done evils unto the resurrection of judgment (<a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>). <p>The book was opened, which is the book of life, and all were judged according to their works (<a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Revelation 20:12, 13</a>). <p>Behold, I come quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to every man according to his work (<a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>). <p>I will punish him according to his ways, and will recompense him for his works (<a href="3927/hosea_4_9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">32:19</a>). <p>In the day of His wrath and righteous judgment, God will render to every man according to his works (<a href="3927/romans_2_5.htm">Romans 2:5, 6</a>). <p>We must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body, according to what he hath done, whether good or evil (<a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] In the beginning of the church there was no other law of imputation, nor will there be any other at its end. That there was no other at the beginning of the church, is evident from Adam and his wife, in that they were condemned because they did evil in eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (<a href="3927/genesis_3_6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>); and that there will be no other at the end of the church, is evident from these words of the Lord: <p>When the Son of man shall come in His glory, then shall He sit on the throne of His glory; and He shall say to the sheep on His right hand, Come ye blessed, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was a hungered and ye gave Me to eat I was thirsty and ye gave Me to drink I was a sojourner and ye took Me in; I was naked and ye clothed Me; I was sick and ye visited Me I was in prison and ye came unto Me. But to the goats on His left, because they had not done good, He said, Depart from Me, ye cursed, into eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels (<a href="3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31-41</a>). <p>From these passages anyone with his eyes open can see that there is an imputation of good and evil.
</p>
<p>
[3] There is also an imputation of faith, because charity which pertains to good, and faith which pertains to truth, reside together in good works; and that otherwise works are not good, may be seen above (n. <a href="373.htm">373-377</a>). Therefore James says: <p>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he offered up his son upon the altar? Seest thou not how faith co-operated with his works, and by works faith was recognized as perfect? And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness (<a href="3927/james_2_21.htm">2:21-23</a>). </p>

<p>
643. VI. THERE IS IMPUTATION, BUT IT IS IMPUTATION OF GOOD AND EVIL, AND AT THE SAME TIME OF FAITH<p>The imputation of good and evil is what is meant when imputation is mentioned in the Word. This is evident from innumerable passages there, some of which have already been quoted. In order that every one may be convinced that there is no other imputation, some additional passages shall now be quoted. These are:<p>"The Son of Man shall come... and then He shall reward every man according to his works" <a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>.<p>"They shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment (A.V., damnation)" <a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>.<p>"A book was opened, which is the book of life... and they were judged every man according to their works" <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>.<p>"Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be" <a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>.<p>"I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings" <a href="3927/hosea_4_9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">32:19</a>.<p>God in the day of wrath, and of His righteous judgment "will render to every man according to his deeds" <a href="3927/romans_2_5.htm">Romans 2:5-6</a>.<p>"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad" <a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] There was no other law of imputation at the beginning of the Church, and there will be no other at the end. That there was no other at the beginning of the Church is evident from the case of Adam and his wife; for they were condemned because they committed evil in eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, <a href="3927/genesis_2_1.htm">Genesis 2</a> and <a href="3927/genesis_3_1.htm">3</a>. That there will be no other at the end of the Church is evident from these words of the Lord:<p>"When the Son of Man shall come in His glory... then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory... and He shall say unto the sheep (A.V., them) on His right hand, Come ye blessed... inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me." But to the goats on the left hand, because they did not do good, He said, "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels" <a href="3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a> and following verses.<p>From these passages every one may see clearly that there is an imputation of good and evil.</p>
<p>
[3] There is also an imputation of faith, because charity, which pertains to good, and faith, which pertains to truth, are united in good works; and unless they are united, the works are not good. This may be seen above in Nos. <a href="373.htm">373-377</a>. Therefore, James says,<p>"Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness" <a href="3927/james_2_21.htm">James 2:21-23</a>. </p>

[2] Non alia Lex imputationis fuit in principio Ecclesiae, nec alia futura est in fine ejus; quod in principio Ecclesiae, patet ex Adamo et ejus Uxore, quod quia malum fecerunt, comedendo ex Arbore scientiae boni et mali, damnati sint, <a href="3927/genesis_2_1.htm">Genesis 2</a>; <a href="3927/genesis_3_1.htm">3</a>; et quod nec alia futura sit in fine Ecclesiae, patet ex his Domini verbis, Quando venerit Filius hominis in gloria Patris sui, <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
tunc sedebit super Throno gloriae suae, et dicet Ovibus a dextris, venite benedicti, et tanquam haereditatem possidete paratum vobis Regnum a fundatione Mundi; Nam esurivi, et dedistis Mihi edere; sitivi et potastis Me. Peregrinus <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
fui et collegistis Me. Nudus fui <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
et induistis Me. Aegrotus fui et visitastis Me. In Custodia fui et venistis ad Me. At vero Hircis a sinistris, quia non fecerunt bona, dixit, discedite a Me maledicti, in Ignem aeternum paratum diabolo et angelis ejus, <a href="3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthaeus 25:31</a> <sup "fn120_5">5</sup>
seqq. Ex his quisque apertis oculis videre potest, quod sit Imputatio boni et mali.</p>
<p>
[3] Quod etiam sit Imputatio Fidei, est quia Charitas quae est boni, et Fides quae est veri, una sunt in bonis Operibus, et quod nisi una sunt, Opera non sint bona, videatur supra, <a href="373.htm">373-377</a>; quare dicit Jacobus, Abraham Pater noster nonne ex Operibus justificatus est, cum obtulit Filium suum super altare, videsne quod Fides cooperata sit Operibus, et ex Operibus Fides pro perfecta cognita sit, ac impleta est Scriptura, quae dicit, credidit Abraham Deo, et imputatum est illi in justitiam, <a href="3927/james_2_21.htm">Jacobus 2:21-23</a>.<p>
