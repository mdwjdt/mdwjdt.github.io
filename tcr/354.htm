<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第354节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>354</b>.⑷无论真理如何众多、如何表现各异，主总能将它们合为一体；主是圣言，天地之神，一切血肉的神，葡萄园或教会的神，信之神，是光本身，是真理和永生。构成信的真理各种各样，在人看来各不相同。例如，有些真理涉及神，创造者，有些涉及主，救世主，有些涉及圣灵和神作工的方式，有些涉及信和仁，有些则涉及自由意愿、悔改、改造、重生、报应等等。然而，它们在主里面全都合为一体，并在人里面被主合为一体，就象一棵葡萄树上的众多枝子那样（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.1.htm">约翰福音5:1</a>等）。因为主会将零散、分离的真理联结成仿佛一个形式，以致它们看上去就是一，并且表现为一种功能。这好比人体的四肢、内脏和器官，它们尽管各式各样，在人看来迥然不同，但仍被作为它们整体形式的人感觉为一体；当他在行动中把它们全部调动起来时，他仿佛通过一个整体在行动。天堂也一样，虽然被划分为无数社群，但在主眼里仍显为一个。如前所述，天堂显为一个人。一个国家同样如此，虽然被划分为很多行政区划，以及省、市，但在具有仁义公平的君王治理下仍行如一体。使得教会成为教会的信之真理之所以能通过主构成一体，是因为主是圣言，天地之神，一切血肉的神，葡萄园或教会的神，信之神，是光本身，是真理和永生。<br />从约翰福音中明显看出主就是圣言，因而是天堂和教会的一切真理：<br />道与神同在，道就是神。道成了肉身。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">约翰福音1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />从马太福音中也明显看出主是天地之神：<br />耶稣说，天上地下一切的权柄都赐给我了。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">马太福音28:18</a>）。<br />主是一切血肉的神，约翰福音：<br />父赐给儿子权柄管理凡有血气的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.2.htm">约翰福音17:2</a>）<br />主是葡萄园或教会的神，以赛亚书：<br />我所爱的有葡萄园。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.1.htm">以赛亚书5:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.2.htm">2</a>）<br />约翰福音：<br />我是葡萄树，你们是枝子。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.5.htm">约翰福音15:5</a>）<br />主是信之神，保罗书信：<br />有信基督的义，就是因信神而来的义。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/腓3.9.htm">腓立比书3:9</a>）<br />主是光本身，约翰福音：<br />祂是真光，照亮一切生在世上的人。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.9.htm">约翰福音1:9</a>）<br /><br />耶稣说，我到世上来，乃是光，叫凡信我的，不住在黑暗里。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.46.htm">约翰福音12:46</a>）<br />主是真理本身，约翰福音：<br />耶稣说，我就是道路，真理，生命。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">约翰福音14:6</a>）<br />主是永生本身，约翰书：<br />我们知道神的儿子已经来到，使我们认识那位真实的，我们也在那位真实的里面，就是在祂儿子耶稣基督里面。这是真神，也是永生。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约壹5.20.htm">约翰一书5:20</a>）<br />有必要补充的是：由于人忙于世俗事务，所以只能为自己获取少许信之真理；然而，他若靠近主，单单敬拜祂，就能获得认识一切真理的能力。因此，凡真正敬拜主的人一听闻之前不知道的信之真理，立刻就会明白、承认并接受它；因为主在他里面，他在主里面；因而真理之光在他里面，他在真理之光里面；正如前面所说，主是光本身和真理本身。这一点可通过以下经历得以证实：我曾看见一个精灵，他在其他精灵面前看似很单纯，因为他承认，唯独主是天地的神，并凭着取自圣言的少许真理确立了他的信。他被提入天堂，加入到更有智慧的天使之列，我听说他在那里和他们一样有智慧。他仿佛完全凭自己说出大量真理，尽管他之前对此一无所知。<br />那些即将进入主的新教会之人将处于同样的状态。这就是如耶利米书所描述的那种状态：<br />这必是我与以色列家所立的约；那些日子以后，我要将我的律法放在他们里面，写在他们心上。他们各人不再教导自己的邻舍和自己的弟兄说：“你该认识耶和华。”因为他们从最小的，到至大的，都必认识我。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.33.htm">耶利米书31:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.34.htm">34</a>）<br />这样的状态也如同以赛亚书所描述的：<br />从耶西的树墩子必发一条。真理必作他胁下的带子。豺狼必与绵羊羔同居，豹子与山羊羔同卧。吃奶的孩子必玩耍在虺蛇的洞口，断奶的婴儿必按手在毒蛇的穴上。因为认识耶和华的知识要充满遍地，好象水充满洋海一般。到那日，外邦人必寻求祂，祂安息之所大有荣耀（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.1.htm">以赛亚书11:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.6.htm">6</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.10.htm">10</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #354 </h4>
<p>
354. (4)不管聖言內容怎麼多, 看起來如何各種各樣, 卻被主聯合為一。祂自己就是聖言, 是天地的上帝, 是全人類的上帝; 是葡萄園或教會的上帝; 是信之上帝; 是光本身; 是真理本身; 是永生。
<p>構成信的真理各種各樣, 在人看來各不相同。例如, 一些是關於上帝創造者, 另一些關於主救贖者, 還有一些關於聖靈及上帝的作為, 一些關於信,義, 還有關於自由選擇,悔改,改造,更新,歸算, 等等。然而, 它們在主裡被連接如一, 主將它們在人裡面連接如一, 如同葡萄樹連接許多枝子(<a href="3927/john_5_1.htm">約翰福音5:1</a>及以後內容)。主將散落分開的真理聯繫在一起, 也就是, 成一種形式, 為了讓它們顯現為一個畫面,作用為一種行動。
<p>這好比四肢,內臟和器官於一個身體, 儘管它們彼此分別, 看起來彼此不同, 但由這些組成的人只會把它們意識為一個整體。當人運用它們所有去行動時, 人們把它們當作一個整體來行動。
<p>天國也是如此:儘管被分成無數個社群, 然後在主眼中只是一, 實際上, 就像一個人(參看之前所述, 第<a href="65.htm">65</a>, <a href="119.htm">119</a>, <a href="268.htm">268</a>, <a href="274.htm">274</a>)。國家也是如此, 儘管被分成許多行政區,省與鎮等等, 在公平公義的君王管制下, 仍運作如一。構成信的真理也是如此, 主使用它們令教會成為教會, 其原因在於主就是聖言; 是天地的上帝; 是全人類的上帝; 是葡萄園或教會的上帝; 是光本身; 是真理本身; 是永生。
<p>[2]在『約翰福音』中, 很明顯看出主就是聖言(Word, 在和合本中譯作"道"), 因而是天國和教會的一切真理:道與上帝同在, 道就是上帝。道成了肉身(<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">約翰福音1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>)。
<p>在『馬太福音』中也可看出主是天地之上帝:耶穌說:"天上地上一切的權力都歸給我了"(<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">馬太福音28:18</a>)。
<p>『約翰福音』中還講到, 主是全人類的上帝:父賜給子權柄管理凡有血氣的(<a href="3927/john_17_2.htm">約翰福音17:2</a>)。
<p>主是葡萄園或教會的上帝:我所愛的有葡萄園(<a href="3927/isaiah_5_1.htm">以賽亞書5:1-2</a>); 我是葡萄樹, 你們是枝子(<a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">約翰福音15:5</a>)。
<p>主是信之上帝, 在保羅書信中:得的義, 因信基督之信, 就是因信上帝(<a href="3927/philippians_3_9.htm">腓立比書3:9</a>)。
<p>主是光本身, 在『約翰福音』:祂是真光, 照亮一切生在世上之人(<a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">約翰福音1:9</a>)。在另一處, 耶穌說:我到世上來, 乃是光, 叫凡信我的, 不住在黑暗裡(<a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">約翰福音12:46</a>)。
<p>主是真理本身:耶穌說:"我是道路, 真理, 生命"(<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">約翰福音14:6</a>)。
<p>主是永生:我們知道, 上帝的兒子已經來到, 使我們認識那位真實的, 我們也在那位真實的裡面, 就是在祂兒子耶穌基督裡面。這是真上帝, 也是永生(<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">約翰一書5:20</a>)。
<p>[3]關於這點, 我想多說幾句:因為人在世界上忙於俗世事務, 只是獲得少許真理來構建自己的信。然而, 倘若他們轉向主並單單敬拜祂, 他們就能獲得認識一切真理的能力。因此, 當真正敬拜主之人一聽到先前從未聽過的真理時, 他們能立即明白,承認並接受真理。因為主在他們裡面, 他們在主裡面。也就是真理之光在他們裡面, 他們在真理之光裡面, 正如我先前所說, 主是光本身,是真理本身。
<p>以下經歷可以支持這個觀點。我曾見過一個看起來簡單的靈與其它靈對話, 因為他承認唯獨主是天地的上帝, 他的信僅憑著聖言的少許真理。後來他被提到天國, 加入到智慧的天人當中, 我聽說他在那裡與他們同樣有智慧。實際上, 他說出了大量的真理, 似乎完全是他自己的想法, 儘管他之前對這些完全無知。
<p>[4]那些進入主的新教會之人將要經歷同樣的狀態。這樣的狀態正是『耶利米書』中所描述的:那些日子以後, 我與以色列家所立的約。我要將我的律法放在他們裡面, 寫在他們心上。他們各人不再教導自己的鄰舍和自己的弟兄說:"你該認識耶和華。"因為他們從最小的, 到至大的, 都必認識我(<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">耶利米書31:33-34</a>)。
<p>這樣的狀態也像以賽亞所描述的:從耶西的蘖必發一條。真理將包裹祂的大腿。豺狼必與綿羊羔同居, 豹子與山羊羔同臥; 吃奶的孩子必玩耍在虺蛇的洞口; 斷奶的嬰兒必按手在毒蛇的穴上。因為認識耶和華的知識要充滿遍地, 好象水充滿洋海一般。到那日, 耶西的根立作萬民必尋求祂, 祂安息之所大有榮耀(<a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">以賽亞書11:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_5.htm">5-10</a>)。 </p>

354. [d] However numerous these truths of faith are and however divergent they appear, they are united by the Lord who is the Word; the God of heaven and earth; the God of all flesh; the God of the vineyard, or the church; the God of faith; the light itself; the truth itself; and eternal life. The truths of faith are various, and appear divergent to us. For example, some are about God the Creator, some are about the Lord the Redeemer, some are about the Holy Spirit and the divine action, some are about faith and about goodwill, some are about free choice, repentance, reformation, regeneration, the assignment of spiritual credit and blame, and so on. Yet they are united in the Lord, and the Lord unites them in us, the way one vine unites many branches (<a href="3927/john_5_1.htm">John 5:1</a> and following). The Lord connects scattered and divided truths into one form so that they present one picture and form one action.
<p>This can be illustrated by a comparison with the limbs, internal organs, and other organs in one body. Although they are different from each other and appear to our sight to be distinct, the human being composed of them does not feel like more than one entity. When a human being uses them all to act, he or she performs that action as if all these components constituted a single entity.
<p>The same is true of heaven. Although it is divided into countless communities, before the Lord it nevertheless looks like one thing - in fact, like one human being, as I have shown above [<a href="65.htm">65</a>, , <a href="268.htm">268</a>; ]. The same thing is true of a country. Although it is broken up into many jurisdictions, provinces, and cities, it is united under a monarch who exercises justice and judgment. It is the same with the truths of faith that the Lord uses to make the church a church. This is because the Lord is the Word; the God of heaven and earth; the God of all flesh; the God of the vineyard, or the church; the God of faith; the light itself; the truth itself; and eternal life.
</p>
<p>
[2] It is clear from John that the Lord is the Word and is therefore all the truth in heaven and the church: "The Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word became flesh" (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>).
<p>It is clear from Matthew that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth: "Jesus said, 'All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me'" (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).
<p>It is clear from John that the Lord is the God of all flesh: "The Father has given the Son power over all flesh" (<a href="3927/john_17_2.htm">John 17:2</a>).
<p>It is clear from Isaiah and from John that the Lord is the God of the vineyard, or the church: "My beloved had a vineyard" (<a href="3927/isaiah_5_1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-2</a>); "I am the vine; you are the branches" (<a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>).
<p>It is clear from Paul that the Lord is the God of faith: "You have the justice that comes from faith in Christ, from the God of faith" (<a href="3927/philippians_3_9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>).
<p>It is clear from John that the Lord is the light itself: "He was the true light that enlightens everyone who comes into the world" (<a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">John 1:9</a>). In another passage Jesus said, "I have come into the world as a light so that all who believe in me would not remain in darkness" (<a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">John 12:46</a>).
<p>It is clear from John that the Lord is the truth itself: "Jesus said, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life. '" (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>).
<p>It is clear from John that the Lord is eternal life: "We know that the Son of God came into the world so that we would know the truth. We are in the truth in Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life" (<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] To these things I should add that because people are busy in this world, they cannot acquire for themselves more than a few truths of faith. Nevertheless, if they turn to the Lord and worship him alone, they gain the ability to recognize all truths. For this reason, as soon as all true worshipers of the Lord hear some truth of faith they had not known before, they immediately see it, acknowledge it, and accept it. The reason is that the Lord is in them and they are in the Lord. Therefore the light of truth is in them and they are in the light of truth because, as I said before, the Lord is the light itself and the truth itself.
<p>I can support this point from experience. I saw a spirit who seemed simple in his interaction with other spirits because he acknowledged the Lord alone as the God of heaven and earth, basing this faith of his on a few truths from the Word. He was taken up into heaven among the wiser angels. I was told that when he was there he was just as wise as they were. In fact, he uttered a great many truths, completely as if they were his own ideas, although he had known none of them before.
</p>
<p>
[4] Those who come into the Lord's new church will experience the same state. This is the state that is described in Jeremiah:
<p>This will be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after these days. I will put my law inside them. I will write it on their hearts. No longer will people teach their friends, and brothers and sisters, saying "Know the Lord. " They will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>)
<p>This state will also be like Isaiah's description:
<p>A branch will come out of the trunk of Jesse. The truth will wrap his thighs. Then the wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the goat. A nursing child will play over a cobra's hole, and a weaned child will reach a hand over the den of a poisonous snake, because the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea. In that day the nations will seek the root of Jesse and glory will be his rest. (<a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, ) </p>

<p>
354. (iv) However numerous the truths of faith are and however varied they appear, they are made one by the Lord, who is the Word, the God of heaven and earth, the God of all flesh, the God of the vineyard or the church, the God of faith and light itself, truth and everlasting life. The truths which make up faith are varied and to human sight appear different. For example, some are concerned with God the Creator, others with the Lord the Redeemer, others with the Holy Spirit and the way God works, others with faith, and charity, others with free will, repentance, reformation and regeneration, imputation, and so on. Yet they all make one in the Lord, and are made one by the Lord in human beings, like many branches on one vine (<a href="3927/john_15_1.htm">John 15:1</a>ff). For the Lord links together scattered and divided truths, so to speak, into a single form, so that they present the appearance of being one and function as one.<p>This can be illustrated by a comparison with the limbs, viscera and organs in a single body: despite their variety and their apparent difference to our sight, still the person whose whole form they compose is only aware of them as a single unit, and when he uses them all in action, he acts as if with a single unit. It is much the same with heaven: although it is divided into countless communities, yet it looks like one in the sight of the Lord. I showed above that it looks like one person. It is much the same with a kingdom, which although divided into many administrative districts, provinces and towns, still acts as one under the guidance of a king endowed with righteousness and judgment. The reason why, by the Lord's doing, the truths that make up faith and make the church truly a church behave in the same way, is that the Lord is the Word, the God of heaven and earth, the God of all flesh, the God of the vineyard or the church, the God of faith, and light itself, truth and everlasting life.</p>
<p>
[2] It is evident in John's gospel that the Lord is the Word, and thus all the truth of heaven and the church.<p>The Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh, <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>It is evident in Matthew that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth.<p>Elsewhere:<p>Jesus said, All power has been given to me in heaven and on earth, <a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">28:18</a>.<p>The Lord is the God of all flesh, in John:<p>The Father gave the Son power over all flesh, <a href="3927/john_17_2.htm">17:2</a>.<p>The Lord is the God of the vineyard or the church, in Isaiah:<p>My beloved had a vineyard, <a href="3927/isaiah_5_1.htm">5:1-2</a>.<p>In John:<p>I am the vine and you are the branches, <a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">15:5</a>.<p>The Lord is the God of faith, in Paul:<p>Having righteousness, which is from faith in Christ, from faith in God, <a href="3927/philippians_3_9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>.<p>The Lord is light itself, in John:<p>He was the true light, which enlightens everyone who comes into the world, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">1:9</a>.<p>Elsewhere:<p>Jesus said, I have come as a light into the world, so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in darkness, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">12:46</a>.<p>The Lord is truth itself, in John:<p>Jesus said, I am the way, truth and life, <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">14:6</a>.<p>The Lord is everlasting life, in John:<p>We know that the Son of God came, so that we might Know Him who is true, and we are in Him who is true in His son Jesus Christ. <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
He is the true God and everlasting life, <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] It needs to be added that worldly affairs prevent people from acquiring more than a few truths to make up faith. Still, if anyone approaches the Lord and worships Him alone, he is enabled to get to know all truths. As soon, therefore, as every true worshipper of the Lord hears some truth of faith previously unknown to him, he immediately sees, acknowledges and accepts it. The reason is that the Lord is in him, and he is in the Lord. Consequently the light of truth is in him, and he is in the light of truth, for, as was said above, the Lord is light itself and truth itself.<p>The following experience can support this. I saw a spirit who in the company of others appeared simple, because he had acknowledged the Lord alone as God of heaven and earth, and had established his faith by means of a few truths taken from the Word. He was carried up into heaven to join the wiser angels, and I was told that there he was as wise as they were; in fact, he uttered numerous truths, entirely as if of himself, of which he had previously been totally ignorant.</p>
<p>
[4] The state of those who are to come into the Lord's new church will be similar. This is the same state as is described by Jeremiah:<p>This shall be the covenant which I shall make with the house of Israel after these days. I will set my law in their midst, and I will write it upon their heart. Nor shall they any more teach a man his companion, or a man his brother, saying, get to know Jehovah <sup "fn10_2">2</sup>
; for all shall know Me, from the least to the greatest of them, <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">31:33-34</a>.<p>That state will also be as described by Isaiah:<p>A shoot will come forth from the stock of Jesse. Truth will be the belt around his thighs. Then the wolf will stay with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the kid. The sucking child will play on the hole of the viper, and the weaned child will thrust his hand on the den of the basilisk. For the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea. On that day the nations will seek the root of Jesse, and peace will be his glory, [<a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_5.htm">5</a>,].<p>

354. (4) However numerous the truths of faith are, and however diverse they appear, they make one from the Lord, who is the Word, the God of heaven and earth, the God of all flesh, the God of the vineyard or church, the God of faith, light itself, the truth, and life eternal. The truths of faith are various, and to man they seem diverse; some, for example, have relation to God the Creator, others to the Lord the Redeemer, others to the Holy Spirit and the Divine Operation, others to faith and charity, others to freedom of choice, repentance, reformation and regeneration, imputation, and so on; still in the Lord and in man from the Lord they make one, like many branches on one vine (<a href="3927/john_15_1.htm">John 15:1</a>, seq .). For the Lord unites scattered and separate truths into one form, as it were, in which they present one aspect and exhibit one action. This may be illustrated by a comparison with the members, viscera and organs in one body; which although various, and in man's sight diverse, are nevertheless felt by man, who is their general form, to be one, and when he is acting from them all he acts as if from one. It is the same with heaven, which, although divided into innumerable societies, still in the Lord's sight appears as a one. (That heaven appears as one Man has been shown above.) It is the same again with a kingdom, which although divided into several governments, and also into provinces and cities, still makes one under a king who governs with justice and judgment. So do the truths of faith from which the church is a church make one from the Lord, because the Lord is the Word, the God of heaven and earth, the God of all flesh, the God of the vineyard or church, the God of faith, light itself, the truth, and life eternal.

[2] That the Lord is the Word, and therefore all truth of heaven and the church, is evident from John: <p>The Word was with God, and God was the Word, and the Word became flesh (1<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>). <p>That the Lord is the God of heaven and earth is evident from Matthew: <p>Jesus said, All power hath been given unto Me in heaven and on earth (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">28:18</a>). <p>That the Lord is the God of all flesh, can be seen from John <p>The Father gave to the Son power over all flesh (<a href="3927/john_17_2.htm">17:2</a>). <p>That the Lord is the God of the vineyard or church, in Isaiah: <p>My well-beloved hath a vineyard (<a href="3927/isaiah_5_1.htm">5:1</a>); <p>and in John: <p>I am the Vine, ye are the branches (<a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">15:5</a>). <p>That the Lord is the God of faith, Paul teaches: <p>Having the righteousness, which is from the faith of Christ, from the God of faith (<a href="3927/philippians_3_9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>). <p>That the Lord is light itself, appears from John: <p>There was the true Light, which lighteth every man coming into the world (<a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">1:9</a>). <p>And elsewhere: <p>Jesus said, I come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth in Me may not abide in darkness (<a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">John 12:46</a>). <p>That the Lord is the truth itself, appears from John: <p>Jesus said, I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">14:6</a>). <p>That the Lord is life eternal, in John: <p>We know that the Son of God is come that we may know Him that is True, even His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life (1<a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">John 5:20</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] To this must be added, that owing to his worldly occupations man can acquire for himself only a few of the truths of faith; nevertheless if he goes to the Lord and worships Him alone, he acquires the power to gain a knowledge of all truths. Therefore every true worshiper of God, as soon as he hears any truth of faith which he has not known before, at once sees, acknowledges, and accepts it; and for the reason that the Lord is in him, and he in the Lord; and consequently the light of truth is in him, and he is in the light of truth; for as before said, the Lord is light itself, and truth itself. This may be corroborated by the following experience: A spirit appeared to me, who in the company of some others seemed simple, because he had acknowledged the Lord alone as the God of heaven and earth, and had strengthened this his faith by certain truths from the Word; this spirit was taken up into heaven among the wiser angels; and it was told me that there he was as wise as they; and that altogether as if from himself he spoke truths in great abundance, of which he had before known nothing.

[4] In a like state will those be who come into the Lord's New Church. This is the state that is described in Jeremiah: <p>This shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; after those days I will put my law in their inward parts, and upon their hearts I will write it and they shall teach no more every man his fellow, or every man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all know Me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>). <p>It is such a state that is described in Isaiah: <p>There shall go forth a Shoot out of the stem of Jesse; truth shall be the girdle of His thighs. There the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid. The suckling shall play on the hole of the adder, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the basilisk's den; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea. In that day the nations shall seek a Root of Jesse, to it shall the Gentiles seek; and His rest shall be glory (<a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">11:1, </a><a href="3927/isaiah_11_5.htm">5, 6</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_10.htm">10</a>). </p>

354. (4) The truths of faith, however numerous they are and diverse they appear, make one from the Lord, who is the Word, the God of heaven and earth, the God of all flesh, the God of the vineyard or Church, the God of faith, and Light itself, Truth, and Life eternal. The truths of faith are various, and to man they seem diverse: as for example, some relate to God the Creator, some to the Lord the Redeemer, some to the Holy Spirit and the Divine Operation, some to Faith and to Charity, and some to Free Will, Repentance, Reformation and Regeneration, Imputation, and other subjects. Nevertheless they make one in the Lord, and with man from the Lord, like the many branches in one vine, <a href="3927/john_15_1.htm">John 15:1</a> and following verses; for the Lord unites scattered and separated truths, as it were into one form, in which they present a united aspect and act in unity. This may be illustrated by comparison with the members, viscera and organs in one body. These are various, and in the sight of man, diverse; yet man, who is their common form, only feels them as one; and when he is acting from them all, he acts as if from a united whole. So heaven, although divided into innumerable societies, yet in the Lord's sight appears as one, that is, as one Man, as has been shown above. Similarly, a kingdom on earth, although divided into many administrative areas, provinces and cities, is yet one when under a king who rules with justice and judgment. It is the same with the truths of faith from the Lord, in virtue of which a Church is such in reality, <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
because the Lord is the Word, the God of heaven and earth, the God of all flesh, the God of the vineyard or Church, the God of faith, and Light itself, Truth, and Life eternal.</p>
<p>
[2] That the Lord is the Word, and thus all the truth of heaven and the Church, is evident from this passage in John:<p>"The Word was with God, and the Word was God... And the Word was made flesh" <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>That the Lord is the God of heaven and earth is evident in Matthew:<p>Jesus said, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth" <a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">28:18</a>.<p>That the Lord is the God of all flesh is evident in John:<p>The Father has given the Son "power over all flesh" <a href="3927/john_17_2.htm">17:2</a>.<p>That the Lord is the God of the vineyard or Church is shown in Isaiah:<p>"My well-beloved hath a vineyard" <a href="3927/isaiah_5_1.htm">5:1-2</a>;<p>and in John:<p>"I am the vine, ye are the branches," <a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">15:5</a>.<p>That the Lord is the God of faith is evident from Paul:<p>"Thou hast the righteousness of the faith of Christ, from the God of faith (A.V., having righteousness 'which is through the faith of Christ, from the God of faith')" <a href="3927/philippians_3_9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>.<p>That the Lord is Light itself is evident in John:<p>"That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world," <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">1:9</a>;<p>and in another place,<p>Jesus said: "I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness," <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">12:46</a>.<p>That the Lord is Truth itself is also shown in John:<p>"Jesus said... I am the way, the truth, and the life," <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">14:6</a>.<p>That the Lord is Life eternal is declared by John:<p>"We know that the Son of God is come into the world... that we may know Him that is true; and we are in the truth in Jesus Christ. (A.V., and we are in Him that is true; even in... Jesus Christ). This is the true God, and eternal life," <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>. </p>
<p>
[3] To the above it should be added that a man, owing to his worldly occupations, can acquire for himself only a few truths of faith. Still, if he approaches the Lord, and worships Him alone, he receives the power to know all truths. Thus every true worshiper of the Lord, on hearing any truth of faith which he had not known before, instantly sees, acknowledges and accepts it, for the Lord is in him, and he is in the Lord. Consequently the light of truth is in him, and he is in the light of truth; for, as has been said above, the Lord is Light itself and Truth itself. The following experience may confirm this. I once saw a certain spirit who, when in company with others, seemed to be of simple faith, because he acknowledged the Lord alone as God of heaven and earth, and confirmed his faith by several truths from the Word. He was taken up into heaven among some wiser angels; and I was told that there he was as wise as they; indeed that he spoke truths in abundance, entirely as of himself, of which he had known nothing before.</p>
<p>
[4] This will be the state of those who come into the Lord's New Church, and is the state described in Jeremiah:<p>"This shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days... I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts... And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them" <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">31:33-34</a><p>Their state will also be like that described in Isaiah:<p>"And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse... truth (A. V., faithfulness) shall be the girdle of His reins. The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid... And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den... for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of JEHOVAH, as the waters cover the sea. And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse... to it shall the Gentiles seek: and His rest shall be glorious." <a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">11</a> [<a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_11_5.htm">5</a>],<p> 11:0. <p>

354. QUOD VERITATES FIDEI, UTCUNQUE NUMEROSAE SUNT, ET DIVERSAE APPARENT, A DOMINO, QUI EST VERBUM, DEUS COELI ET TERRAE, DEUS OMNIS CARNIS, DEUS VINEAE SEU ECCLESIAE, DEUS FIDEI, ET IPSA LUX, VERITAS, ET VITA AETERNA, UNUM FACIANT. Veritates fidei sunt variae et coram homine apparent diversae, sicut pro exemplo, aliae de Deo Creatore, aliae de Domino Redemptore, aliae de Spiritu Sancto et Divina Operatione, aliae de Fide deque Charitate, et aliae de Libero Arbitrio, Poenitentia, Reformatione et Regeneratione, Imputatione, et sic porro; usque unum faciunt in Domino, et apud hominem a Domino, sicut multi palmites in una Vite, <a href="3927/john_15_1.htm">Johannes 15:1</a>, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
seq. Dominus enim conjungit veritates sparsas et divisas sicut in unam formam, in qua unum conspectum praebent, et unum actum sistunt: hoc illustrari potest per comparationem cum membris, visceribus, et organis in uno corpore, quae tametsi varia sunt, et coram visu hominis diversa, usque tamen homo, qui est communis forma illorum, non sentit nisi unum, et cum ex omnibus agit, agit sicut ut ex uno. Simile est cum Coelo, quod tametsi in innumerabiles Societates distinctum est, usque illud coram Domino apparet ut unum; quod sicut unus Homo, supra ostensum est. Simile etiam est sicut cum Regno, quod tametsi in plures administraturas, et quoque provincias et urbes divisum est, usque tamen illud <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
sub Rege, cui est justitia et judicium, unum facit. Quod simile sit cum Veritatibus fidei, ex quibus Ecclesia est Ecclesia, a Domino, est quia Dominus est Verbum, Deus Coeli et Terrae, Deus omnis carnis, Deus Vineae seu Ecclesiae, Deus fidei, et ipsa Lux, Veritas, et Vita aeterna.</p>
<p>
[2] Quod Dominus sit Verbum, et sic omne Verum Coeli et Ecclesiae, constat apud Johannem, Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum, et Verbum Caro factum est, <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">Johannes 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>. <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
Quod Dominus sit Deus Coeli et Terrae, constat apud Matthaeum, Jesus dixit, data est Mihi omnis potestas in Coelo et in Terra, <a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthaeus 28:18</a>. Quod Dominus sit Deus omnis Carnis, apud Johannem, "Pater dedit Filio potestatem omnis carnis," <a href="3927/matthew_17_2.htm">Matthaeus 17:2</a>. <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
Quod Dominus sit Deus Vineae seu Ecclesiae, apud Esajam, Vinea fuit dilecto meo, <a href="3927/isaiah_5_1.htm">Esajas 5:1-2</a>, et apud Johannem, Ego sum Vitis et vos palmites, <a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">15:5</a>. Quod Dominus sit Deus fidei, apud Paulum, Habes justitiam, quae ex fide Christi, ex Deo fidei, <a href="3927/philippians_3_9.htm">Philippenses 3:9</a>. Quod Dominus sit ipsa Lux, apud Johannem, Erat vera Lux, quae illuminat omnem hominem venientem in Mundum, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">1:9</a> et alibi, Jesus dixit, Ego Lux in Mundum veni, ut omnis qui credit in Me, in tenebris non maneat, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">12:46</a>. Quod Dominus sit ipsa Veritas, apud Johannem, Jesus dixit, Ego sum Via, Veritas, et Vita, <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">14:6</a>. Quod Dominus sit Vita aeterna, apud Johannem, "Scimus quod Filius Dei in Mundum venerit, ut cognoscamus veritatem, et sumus in Veritate in Jesu Christo; Hic est Verus Deus, et Vita aeterna," <a href="3927/1-john_5_20.htm">1 Johannes 5:20</a>. <sup "fn120_5">5</sup>
</p>
<p>
[3] His adjiciendum est, quod homo propter sua negotia in Mundo non possit sibi comparare Veritates fidei nisi paucas; sed usque si adit Dominum, et Ipsum Solum colit, in potentiam cognoscendi omnes veritates venit, quapropter omnis vere Cultor Domini, ut primum audit aliquam veritatem fidei, quam prius non noverat, illico videt, agnoscit et recipit illam, causa est, quia Dominus est in illo, et <sup "fn120_6">6</sup>
ille in Domino; consequenter est Lux veritatis in illo, et ille in luce veritatis, nam ut supra dictum est, <sup "fn120_7">7</sup>
Dominus est ipsa Lux, et ipsa Veritas. Hoc confirmari potest ex hac experientia, visus mihi est Spiritus, qui in consortio aliorum apparuit simplex, ex causa quia Solum Dominum pro Deo Coeli et Terrae agnovit, et hanc suam fidem per aliquas veritates ex Verbo stabilivit; ille sublatus est in Coelum inter Angelos sapientiores, et dictum mihi est, quod ibi aeque Sapiens esset ut illi, imo quod loquutus sit veritates in copia, prorsus ut ex se, de quibus nihil quicquam noverat prius.</p>
<p>
[4] Similis status erit illis, qui in Novam Domini Ecclesiam venturi sunt: idem hic status est, qui describitur apud Jeremiam, "Hoc foedus erit, quod pangam cum Domo Israelis post dies hos; dabo legem meam in medio illorum, et super cor illorum scribam illam: neque docebunt amplius vir socium suum, aut vir fratrem suum, dicendo, cognoscite Jehovam, <sup "fn120_8">8</sup>
omnes enim cognoscent Me, a minimo eorum usque ad maximum eorum," <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">Jeremias 31:33-34</a>. Erit etiam status ille, qualis describitur apud Esajam: "Exibit virga de trunco Jischaji; erit Veritas cingulum feminum ejus; tunc commorabitur lupus cum agno, et pardus cum haedo cubabit; ludet sugens super foramine viperae, et super speluncam basilisci ablactatus manum impellet; quia plena erit Terra scientia Jehovae, sicut aquae mare contegunt; in die illo Radicem Jischaji gentes quaerent, et erit quies Ejus gloria," <a href="3927/jeremiah_11_1.htm">11:1</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_11_5.htm">5-10</a>. <sup "fn120_9">9</sup>
