834. 我曾被允许感受一夫多妻的爱之热的性质。 我与扮演过穆罕默德的某个灵有过一次对话。 这个替代者在远处和我谈了一会儿后, 送给我一个乌木勺子及它们出自他的其它证据。 同时, 有一个通道被打开, 以便他们一夫多妻之爱所产生的热从各个地方传送出来。 有些地方的热, 感觉就象洗澡后公共浴室里的热; 有些地方的热, 象炖着肉的厨房里的热; 有的象为销售而暴露气味浓重食物的饮食店里的热; 有的象正预备乳液及类似物的药剂师地窖里的热; 有的象烟花柳巷里的热; 有的则象出售兽皮, 皮革, 鞋子的商店里的热。 这热还含有某种由嫉妒产生的恶臭, 干燥和炽热之物。 另一方面, 在基督教天堂, 当他们爱的乐趣被感受为气味时, 这热是芳香的, 如同花园, 葡萄园, 玫瑰园的香味, 还如同出售香水的商店, 榨酒的地方和酒窖散发的香味。 爱的乐趣在灵界经常被感受为气味, 这一点在章节末尾的记事中已经说明。 </p>

834. On one occasion I was allowed to experience the heat of their polygamous love. I was in a conversation with one of the people who took turns acting as their Muhammad. After I had spoken with him for a while from a certain distance away, he sent me an ivory spoon and some other objects that identified him as the sender. At that same time, a communication was opened up to me from various places devoted to the heat of their polygamous love.
<p>The heat from some of these places felt and smelled like a bathhouse after people have bathed; from others it was like a kitchen where someone is boiling meat; from others, like hole-in-the-wall shops that are selling hot food that smells rank; from others, like an apothecary's basement where medicinal emulsions and other remedies are being prepared; from others, like brothels and whorehouses; from others, like a shop where hides, leather, and shoes are sold. In that heat there was a sense of rottenness, bitterness, and burning jealousy.
<p>The heat in the Christian heavens, though, when the delight of the angels' love there comes across as a smell, has the fragrance of gardens and vineyards and beds of roses. In some places, it smells like a perfumer's shop; in others, like a wine press or a winemaker's cellar.
<p>(I have shown a number of times in the memorable occurrences after chapters that in the spiritual world the delightful feelings associated with various kinds of love often come across as aromas.) </p>

834. I was once allowed to experience the nature of the heat generated by their polygamous love. I talked to one of them, a spirit who played the part of Mohammed; and this substitute, after talking with me for a while at a distance, sent me an ivory spoon and other evidences that they came from him. At the same time a passage was opened to transmit from various places the heat generated by their polygamous love. From some places it was felt as like the heat in baths after washing; from some places like the heat in the kitchens where meat is stewing; from some like the heat in cook-shops where strong-smelling foods are exposed for sale; from some like that in pharmacists' cellars, where emulsions and the like are being prepared; from some like the heat in brothels and bawdy-houses; and from some like that in shops where hides, leather and shoes are sold. This heat contained something as it were rancid, dry and burning from jealousy. On the other hand, the heat in Christian heavens, when the pleasure of their love is felt as an odour, is fragrant as in gardens and vineyards, and as in rose-beds, in other places as in shops selling perfume, in other places as in wine-presses and wine-cellars. The pleasures of loves are very often experienced in the spiritual world as odours, as I have shown repeatedly at the ends of chapters in the accounts of my experiences. </p>

834. It was once granted me to perceive the nature of the heat of their polygamic love. I had a talk with one who had occupied the place of Mohammed, and after some conversation with him at a distance this substitute sent to me an ebony spoon and some other things, which were proofs that they came from him; and at the same time there were opened from various places outlets for the heat of their polygamic love. From some of these this was felt to be like the heat in bathing rooms after bathing, from some like the heat in kitchens where meats are boiling, from some like the heat in eating-houses where strong-smelling food is exposed for sale, from some like the heat in apothecaries' cellars, where emulsions and such things are prepared, from some like the heat in stews and brothels, and from others like the heat in stores where skins, leather, and shoes are sold. There was also something rank, harsh, and burning in the heat, arising from jealousy. But the heat in the Christian heavens, when the delight of their love is perceived as an odor, is fragrant like the odor in gardens, vineyards, and rose-gardens, in some places like that where spices are sold, and in others like that of wine-presses and wine-cellars. That the delights from loves in the spiritual world are frequently perceived as odors has been shown throughout my Memorable Relations which follow the chapters. </p>

834. I was once allowed to perceive the nature of the heat of their polygamous love. I was speaking with one who acted in place of Mohammed, and that deputy, after some conversation at a distance, sent me an ebony spoon and other things as tokens that they were from him. Immediately a means of communication was opened up from various places for the heat of their polygamous love. From some places this heat was felt like that in baths after bathing; from some like that in kitchens where flesh is being boiled; from some like the heat in cook-shops where foul smelling food is exposed for sale; from some like that in apothecaries' laboratories where emulsions and such medicaments are prepared; from some like that in houses of ill-repute; and from some like that in shops where hides, leather and shoes are sold. There was also in that heat something of a rancid, acrid and scorching nature arising from jealousy. On the other hand, in the Christian heavens where the delight of their love is perceived as an odor, the heat is fragrant like that in gardens and vineyards, and in rose gardens; and in some places it is like that in perfumeries, wine-presses and wine cellars. It has been shown in several of my narratives appended to the chapters of this book that the joys of love in the spiritual world are frequently perceived as odors. </p>

834. Quondam datum est percipere, qualis est Calor amoris Polygamici illorum; loquutus sum cum uno, qui vicem Mahumedis obivit, et Vicarius ille post aliquam loquelam ad distantiam cum illo, transmisit ad me cochleare ebenum, et alia, quae erant indicia quod ab illo; et simul tunc aperta est communicatio e variis locis pro calore amoris Polygamici illorum, qui sentitus est e quibusdam locis sicut calor in Balneis post lavationes; e quibusdam sicut calor in Culinis ubi lixantur carnes; e quibusdam sicut calor in Popinis ubi esculenta foetida veno exstant; ex quibusdam sicut in Cellariis apud Pharmacopolas, ubi emulsa et similia parantur; e quibusdam sicut calor in lupanariis et ganeis; et e quibusdam sicut in Tabernis, ubi pelles, coria et calcei venduntur; Calori isti etiam inerat sicut rancidum, austerum et urens ex Zelotypia. Calor autem in Coelis Christianis, dum Jucundum amoris illorum sentitur ut Odor, est fragrans sicut in Hortis et Vineis, et sicut in Rosetis, et alicubi sicut in Aromatopoliis, et alicubi sicut in Torcularibus, et in Cellis vinariis. Quod Jucunda Amorum in Mundo spirituali multoties sentiantur ut Odores, in MEMORABILIBUS <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
