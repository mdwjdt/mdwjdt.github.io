<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第207节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>207</b>.如今，能使人明白圣言属灵之义的对应学已被揭示出来。因为教会的神圣真理正逐渐进入光明，而圣言的属灵之义就是由这些真理构成的。当这些真理在人里面时，圣言的字义就无法被歪曲。圣言的字义能被掰向任意方向，若被掰向虚假，那么其神圣，无论内在的还是外在的，就都被摧毁。而若被掰向真理，其神圣就得以保持。我将在下文详述这个问题（260，508节）。如今，属灵之义正被打开。这就是启示录（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.11.htm">19:11</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.18.htm">18</a>）所描述的约翰看见天开了和一匹白马，还看见并听见站在太阳中的一位天使叫众人来赴大筵席所表示的。不过，在很长一段时间内，这属灵之义得不到承认。这一现实就是兽与地上的王将与骑在白马上的那位争战（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.19.htm">启示录19:19</a>），以及龙追赶那生了儿子的妇人，直追到旷野，在那里从口中吐出水来，像河一样，要将她冲去（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.13.htm">启示录12:13</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.17.htm">17</a>）所表示的。</p>

207. 如今, 這些對應的學問(憑此可明白聖言的屬靈意義)已被揭示, 是因為教會的神性真理正向逐漸顯于光明之中。這些真理就是由聖言的屬靈意義組成。當這些真理在我們裡面時, 聖言的文字意義就無法被歪曲。聖言的文字意思能被掰向任何方向, 但如果被掰向偽謬的一方, 其內在的神聖亦被摧毀, 外在的神聖也能逃厄運。如果被掰向真理一方, 就仍保持神聖。(詳情見<a href="260.htm">260</a>和<a href="508.htm">508</a>節)
<p>聖言的屬靈意義現今被打開, 就是約翰看見天開了, 見一匹白馬所指的含義, 還有他看見並聽到在太陽當中的一位天人召集人們赴大筵席(<a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">啟示錄19:11-18</a>)。然而, 屬靈意義會在很長一段時期內不被接受, 獸與地上的王將與騎在白馬上的那位爭戰所表達的就是這個意思(<a href="3927/revelation_19_19.htm">啟示錄19:19</a>)。還有, 龍先驅趕那將生子的婦人, 然後追到曠野並吐水如江河來沖她(<a href="3927/revelation_12_13.htm">啟示錄12:13-17</a>)。 </p>

207. The study of correspondences that yields the Word's spiritual meaning has been revealed today because now the divine truths of the church are coming forward into the light. These truths are what the Word's spiritual meaning consists of. When these truths are in us, the Word's literal meaning cannot be perverted. The Word's literal meaning is capable of being bent this way and that, but if it is bent in the direction of falsity, its inner holiness is destroyed, and so is its outer holiness. If it is bent in the direction of truth, it stays holy. (More will be said about this in what is to come [260, 508].)
<p>The opening of the spiritual meaning at this day is what is meant by John's seeing heaven opened and seeing a white horse, and seeing and hearing an angel standing in the sun calling all people to a great feast (<a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-18</a>). The fact that the spiritual meaning would not be acknowledged for a long time, however, is what is meant by the beast and the kings of the earth who were going to make war against the One sitting on the white horse (<a href="3927/revelation_19_19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a>) and by the dragon that first pursued the woman who had given birth to a son, then went out into the desert and cast water like a river out of its mouth to drown her (<a href="3927/revelation_12_13.htm">Revelation 12:13-17</a>). </p>

207. The science of correspondences, which allows the spiritual sense to be grasped, has been revealed at the present time, because the Divine truths of the church are now coming into light, and it is of these that the spiritual sense of the Word consists. When people possess these, the literal sense of the Word cannot be corrupted. The literal sense of the Word can be bent in either direction; if it is bent towards falsehood, then its inward, and with it its outward, holiness is destroyed. But if it is bent towards truth, its holiness is maintained. But I shall have more to say on this subject in the following pages.<p>The opening out of the spiritual sense at the present time is meant by John's vision of heaven being opened and of a white horse, and also by his seeing and hearing an angel standing in the sun, inviting all to a great feast, as described in Revelation (<a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-18</a>). The fact that for a long time it would not be recognised is meant by the beast and the kings of the earth, who were going to make war on the rider of the white horse (<a href="3927/revelation_19_19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a>); and also by the dragon's pursuit into the desert of the woman who had borne a son, and there emitting water from its mouth like a river, to drown her (Rev. '<a href="3927/revelation_12_13.htm">Revelation 12:13-17</a>). </p>

207. The knowledge of correspondences, whereby the spiritual sense of the Word is communicated, has been at this day revealed because the Divine truths of the church are now being brought to light, and these are the truths of which the spiritual sense of the Word consists; and when these truths are in man the sense of the letter of the Word cannot be perverted. For the sense of the letter of the Word may be turned in any direction. If it is turned to what is false its internal holiness perishes, and with it its external holiness; but if turned to what is true its holiness remains. But of all this more shall be said in what follows. That the spiritual sense would be opened at this time is meant by John's seeing heaven opened, and then seeing a white horse; also by his seeing and hearing an angel standing in the sun calling all to the great supper (on which see<a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-18</a>). But that this sense would not for a long time be acknowledged is meant by the beast and the kings of the earth being about to make war with Him who sat upon the white horse (<a href="3927/revelation_19_19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a>); also by the dragon's persecuting the woman who brought forth the man-child, even to the wilderness, where he cast out of his mouth water as a flood, that he might overwhelm her (<a href="3927/revelation_12_13.htm">Revelation 12:13-17</a>). </p>

207. The science of correspondences, by which is communicated the spiritual sense [of the Word], is to-day revealed, because the Divine truths of the Church are now being brought to light. These are the truths of which the spiritual sense of the Word consists, and while these are in man, the sense of the Letter of the Word cannot be perverted. For this sense can be turned in two ways: if it is turned to favor falsity, then its internal holiness perishes, and with this, its external holiness also; but if it is turned to what is true, its holiness remains. More, however, will be said on this subject in what follows. That the spiritual sense would be opened at this time is meant by John's seeing heaven open, and then the white horse; and also by his seeing and hearing an angel, who stood in the sun and called all together to a great supper, <a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-18</a>. However, that this sense would not be acknowledged for a long time, is meant by the beast and the kings of the earth, who would make war with Him that sat upon the white horse, <a href="3927/revelation_19_19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a>; and also by the dragon pursuing the woman, that brought forth the man-child, into the wilderness, where he cast out of his mouth water as a flood, to overwhelm her, <a href="3927/revelation_12_13.htm">Revelation 12:13-17</a>. </p>

207. Quod Scientia Correspondentiarum, per quam datur Sensus spiritualis, hodie revelata sit, est causa, quia nunc Divina Vera Ecclesiae in lucem prodeunt, et haec sunt, ex quibus Sensus spiritualis Verbi consistit; et dum haec in homine sunt, sensus literae Verbi non perverti potest: Sensus enim literae Verbi potest flecti huc illuc, sed si flectitur ad Falsum, tunc perit ejus Sanctitas interna et cum hac externa, at si flectitur ad Verum, manet illa; sed de his in sequentibus plura dicentur. Quod Sensus spiritualis hodie aperiretur, intelligitur per quod Johannes viderit Coelum apertum, et tunc Equum album, tum quod viderit et audiverit, quod Angelus stans in Sole omnes ad Caenam magnam <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
convocaverit, de quibus in <a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Apocalypsi 19:11-18</a>. Quod autem diu non agnosceretur, intelligitur per Bestiam et per Reges terrae, qui facturi bellum cum Sedente super Equo albo, <a href="3927/revelation_19_19.htm">Apocalypsis 19:19</a> ut et per Draconem, quod persequutus sit Mulierem, quae peperit Filium, usque in desertum, <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
et ibi ex ore suo ejecerit aquas sicut flumen, ut illam submergeret, <a href="3927/revelation_12_13.htm">Apocalypsis 12:13-17</a>.<p>
