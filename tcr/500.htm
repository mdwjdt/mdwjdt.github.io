500. If We Did Lack Free Choice in Spiritual Matters, Then in a Single Day Everyone on the Whole Planet Could Be Induced to Believe in the Lord; but in Fact This Cannot Happen, Because What We Do Not Accept through Our Free Choice Does Not Stay with Us
<p>If free choice in spiritual matters had not been granted to us, then in a single day God could induce everyone on the planet to believe in him; but this is only taken as true when divine omnipotence is not well understood. People who do not understand divine omnipotence are able to reckon either that no divine design exists, or that God can act just as easily against his design as with it. But in fact, without the divine design no creation would have been possible. The first element of the divine design is that we are an image of God, so that we can be perfected in love and wisdom and therefore become more and more of an image [of him]. God continually works toward this within us, but if we had no free choice in spiritual matters that would allow us to turn ourselves toward God and forge a partnership with him, his work would be pointless, because his goal would be impossible to achieve.
<p>There is a design from which and according to which the whole world and each and everything in it was created. And because all creation was brought about from that design and according to it, therefore God is called the divine design itself. Therefore it is the same whether you say "to act against the divine design" or "to act against God. " God could not act against his own divine design, since that would in fact be acting against himself. Therefore he leads every human being in a manner in keeping with his being that design. The wandering and the fallen he leads into that design; the resistant he leads toward it.

<p>
[2] If it would have been possible to create the human race without endowing it with free choice in spiritual matters, what then would have been easier for the omnipotent God than to induce everyone on the whole planet to believe in the Lord? Could he not have installed this faith in everyone, either directly or indirectly? He could have done so directly through his own absolute power and his constant, irresistible efforts to save us; or he could have done it indirectly through inflicting torment upon our consciences and devastating convulsions upon our bodies, and threatening us with death if we did not accept. He could have achieved the same result by opening hell to us and surrounding us with devils holding terrifying torches in their hands, or by calling up from hell dead people we once knew who now look like horrible specters. But to these arguments comes a response in the words of Abraham to the rich man in hell: "If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, they are not going to be persuaded even if someone were to rise from the dead" (<a href="3927/luke_16_31.htm">Luke 16:31</a>). </p>

500. X. If people did not have free will in spiritual matters, everyone throughout the world could in the course of a single day have been brought to believe in the Lord. But this would be impossible, because what a person does not accept of his own free will does not last.<p>The idea that God without giving people free will in spiritual matters could bring everyone throughout the world in the course of a single day to believe in Himself, is a consequence of failing to understand God's omnipotence. Those who misunderstand God's omnipotence may think either that there is no such thing as order, or that God can act just as much against order as in accordance with it. Yet in fact without order no creation would have been possible.<p>The primary end of order is that man should be an image of God; consequently he should become more and more perfect in love and wisdom, and thus more and more an image of God. God is continually working to produce this result in man; but without free will in spiritual matters, which enables a person to turn towards God and link himself in turn with Him, it would be labour in vain, since it would be impossible. For it is order from which and according to which the whole world with every single thing in it was created. Because all creation derives from order and is in accordance with order, God is called order itself. It is therefore the same thing whether you speak of acting contrary to Divine order or acting contrary to God. In fact, God Himself cannot act contrary to His Divine order, if this is really acting contrary to Himself. He therefore guides every person in accordance with Himself as order, and those who have strayed and fallen away He guides to it, and those who resist towards it.</p>
<p>
[2] If man could have been created without free will in spiritual matters, what would then have been easier for almighty God than to bring everyone throughout the world to believe in the Lord? Surely He could have implanted this faith in everyone, both directly and indirectly? Directly, through His absolute power and its irresistible working, which never ceases aiming at man's salvation; or indirectly, through causing him to feel the pangs of conscience, through convulsions of the body producing unconsciousness, and serious threats of death, if he fails to accept. In addition, by opening up hell and displaying devils with terrifying torches in their hands, or by summoning up from hell the dead whom they had known in the form of terrible spectres. The reply to these suggestions is given in Abraham's words to the rich man in hell:<p>If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead, <a href="3927/luke_16_31.htm">Luke 16:31</a>. </p>

500. XI. IF MEN HAD NOT FREEDOM OF CHOICE IN SPIRITUAL THINGS, ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE WORLD MIGHT IN ONE DAY BE LED TO BELIEVE IN THE LORD; BUT THIS CANNOT BE DONE, BECAUSE THAT WHICH IS NOT RECEIVED BY MAN WITH FREEDOM OF CHOICE DOES NOT REMAIN. <p>That God could, in one day, if freedom of choice in spiritual things had not been given to man, lead all the inhabitants of the world to believe in Him, follows as a true conclusion from the Divine omnipotence when not rightly understood. Those who do not understand the Divine omnipotence, may suppose either that there is no such thing as order, or that God can act contrary to order as well as according to it; when yet, without order, no creation was possible. The primary thing of order is for man to be an image of God, consequently, that he be continually perfecting in love and wisdom, and thus becoming that image more and more. To this end God is working continually in man; but this would be in vain, for it would be impossible, if man were destitute of freedom of choice in spiritual things, whereby he could turn to God and reciprocally conjoin himself with God. For there is an order from which and according to which the whole universe, with each and all things in it, was created; and because all creation was effected from that order and according to it God is called order itself. Thus it is the same whether we say, acting contrary to order, or acting contrary to God. God Himself, even, cannot act contrary to His own Divine order, since this would be to act contrary to His very Self; and therefore He leads every man according to that order which is Himself, guiding the wandering and the fallen into it, and the resisting toward it. If man could have been created without freedom of choice in spiritual things, what would have been more easy for an omnipotent God than to lead all the inhabitants of the world to believe in the Lord? Could He not have implanted this faith in everyone, both without means and by means, without means by His absolute power and its irresistible operation, which is unceasing in its efforts to save man; or by means, through torments brought upon man's conscience, or through mortal convulsions of the body and awful threats of death, if he did not receive that faith; or still further, by the opening of hell and the presence of devils therefrom holding frightful torches in their hands, or by calling forth therefrom the dead whom they had known, in the forms of fearful specters? But to all this there is a reply in the words of Abraham to the rich man in hell, <p>If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead (<a href="3927/luke_16_31.htm">Luke 16:31</a>). </p>

500. X. IF MEN HAD NOT FREE WILL IN SPIRITUAL THINGS, IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR ALL MEN THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE WORLD, IN A SINGLE DAY, TO BE LED TO BELIEVE ON THE LORD; BUT THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE, BECAUSE NOTHING REMAINS WITH A MAN BUT WHAT HE RECEIVES IN THE EXERCISE OF FREE WILL.<p>If God had not endowed men with free will in spiritual things He could lead all men throughout the whole world, in a single day, to believe on Him; but this is a supposition which follows from the failure to understand the nature of the Divine omnipotence. Those who do not understand the Divine omnipotence may suppose either that there is no such thing as order, or that God can act contrary to order as well as according to it; whereas creation was impossible without it. The primary end of order is that man should be an image of God; consequently that he should be perfected in love and wisdom, and thus more and more become that image. This is the purpose of God's continual operation with him; but without free will in spiritual things, by which man has the power to turn to God, and to enter into mutual conjunction with Him, it would be in vain, because impossible. For it is from and according to order that the whole world with everything belonging to it was created. For this reason God is called Order itself; so that it is the same thing whether it is said to act contrary to Divine order or contrary to God. Indeed God cannot act contrary to His own Divine order, since that would be to act contrary to Himself. He, therefore, leads all men according to order, that is, according to Himself, the wandering and the back-sliding into it, and the disobedient towards it.<p>If man could have been created without free will in spiritual things, what would then be more easy for omnipotent God than to lead all men throughout the whole universe to believe on the Lord? He could have conferred this faith on everyone, immediately as well as mediately; immediately by His absolute power, and by its irresistible and continual operation for man's salvation; and mediately by exciting the pangs of conscience, by deadly bodily torments and by grievous threats of death if he refused to accept it; and also by opening hell and presenting the devils with terrifying torches in their hands, or by summoning thence the dead whom he had known, in the form of frightful spectres. To this the words of Abraham to the rich man in hell are the reply:<p>"If they hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead" <a href="3927/luke_16_31.htm">Luke 16:31</a>. </p>

Quod si hominibus non foret Liberum Arbitrium in spiritualibus, potuissent omnes in universo terrarum orbe intra unum diem adduci ad credendum in Dominum; sed quod hoc non fieri possit, est causa, quia id quod non ex Libero Arbitrio recipitur ab homine, non maneat.<p>Quod Deus absque dato hominibus Libero Arbitrio in spiritualibus posset omnes in universo terrarum orbe intra unum diem adducere ad credendum in Se, sequitur ut verum ex non intellecta Omnipotentia Divina; illi qui Omnipotentiam Divinam non intelligunt, opinari possunt, vel quod non sit ordo, vel quod Deus possit facere aeque contra ordinem, ac secundum illum, cum tamen absque ordine nulla Creatio dabilis fuit; primarium ordinis est, ut homo sit imago Dei, proinde ut perficiatur amore et sapientia, et sic plus et plus fiat illa; hoc Deus operatur continue apud hominem, sed absque Libero arbitrio in spiritualibus, per quod homo se possit convertere ad Deum, et se vicissim conjungere Ipsi, frustraneum, quia impossibile, foret, nam Ordo est, ex quo et secundum quem totus Mundus cum omnibus et singulis ejus creatus est, et quia ex illo et secundum <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
