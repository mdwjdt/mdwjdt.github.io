<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>848</b>. 闻听此言，天人非常高兴，但却发觉我内心的悲哀，就问：“你为何难过？”我说：“尽管主现在所透露的这些奥秘胜过目前所公开的一切知识，是无可比拟的无价之宝，但在世上仍被视为毫无价值。”天人听到这话十分震惊，就恳求主允许他们俯视尘世。他们向下望去，只见那里一片漆黑！然后，他们被吩咐将这些奥秘写在一张纸上，这纸会被带到地上，他们将见证咄咄怪事。于是，他们照做了。只见写有奥秘的那张纸从天上飘落下去，尚在灵界期间，它在降落时闪耀如星辰。但当它落入尘世时，其光线消失了。越是下降，它就变得越暗。当天人把它带到学识渊博的神职人员以及平信徒的集会时，就听到一阵窃窃私语，其中有这些话：“这是什么？是重要的东西吗？这些事知不知道有何区别？无疑，它们纯粹是大脑凭空想象的产物。”然后，就看到好象有人拾起这张纸，把它折叠起来，用手指卷起又展开，以抹去上面的字迹；有的将它撕成碎片，甚至还有人想把它踩到脚底下。但主制止了他们的暴行，吩咐天人收回这张纸，并守护好它。天人由此悲伤，思想“这要到什么时候？”他们被告知：要一载二载半载（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.14.htm">启示录12:14</a>） 。</p>

848. 众天人听到这些话都十分高兴, 但却觉察到我心中的悲哀, 就问: “你为什么难过? ”我说: “因为主现在所透露的这些奥秘, 虽然胜过目前所有知识, 是无可比拟, 至尊至贵的, 但在地上仍被视为没有价值。 ”天人听到这话感到震惊, 就恳求主允许他们俯视尘世, 他们向下望去, 看哪, 那里一片漆黑。 他们被吩咐将这些奥秘写在纸上, 这纸会被带到地上, 他们将看到奇怪的现象。 他们照做后, 快看, 上面写着奥秘的纸张从天上被带下去, 尚在灵界期间, 它在下降过程中闪耀如星辰, 但当它抵达尘世时, 它的亮度减弱了, 随着它下降, 它的光完全变黑。 当天人把它带到学识渊博的神职人员以及平信徒的集会中时, 就听到一阵窃窃私语, 其中有这些话: “这是什么? 是重要的东西吗? 这些事知道和不知道有什么区别吗? 无疑, 它们纯粹是大脑的臆造物。 ”于是出现以下现象, 有的拿起纸, 把它折叠起来, 用手指卷起又展开, 有的则将它撕成碎片, 还想把它踩到脚底下。 但主制止了他们的暴行, 吩咐天人收回这张纸, 并守护好它。 因为天人由此悲伤, 思想“这要到什么时候? ”, 所以经上说:<p>要一载二载半载。 (<a href="3927/revelation_12_14.htm">启示录12:14</a>) </p>

848. The angels were overjoyed to hear all this; yet they sensed a great sadness in me. "Where is your sadness coming from?" they asked me.
<p>"Although the secrets that the Lord has revealed at this time are of higher quality and greater worth than any other concepts that have been published before," I said, "nevertheless on earth they are thought to have no value at all. "
<p>The angels were astounded to hear this. They asked the Lord for permission to look down into the world. They looked down and behold, there was nothing but darkness there.
<p>The angels were told to write these secrets on a piece of paper and send it down to the earth, and they would see a sign of things to come.
<p>They did so. The piece of paper that had these secrets written on it was sent down from heaven. As it descended, but while it was still in the spiritual world, it was shining like a star. When it passed down into the physical world, however, the light went out; on its way down the piece of paper grew darker and darker.
<p>When the angels sent the piece of paper to conferences of well-educated clergy and laity, a murmur was heard from many of them. They were saying, "What is this? Does it have any value? What difference does it make whether we know these things or not? This is just a figment of someone's imagination. " It looked like some of them were taking the piece of paper, folding it, and continually rolling and unrolling it in their fingers. Others looked like they were tearing at it and trying to stomp on it with their feet, but the Lord restrained them from committing that outrage. The angels were ordered to take it back and keep it safe.
<p>Because the angels then became sad and were thinking, "How long will it be like this?" they were told, "For a time and times and half a time" (<a href="3927/revelation_12_14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>). </p>

848. The angels were very glad to hear both of these accounts, but they were aware of a sadness in me, and they kept asking: 'What makes you sad?' I said that although the secrets revealed by the Lord at the present time surpass in excellence and importance all spiritual knowledge made public up to now, they are regarded on earth as of no value.<p>This surprised the angels, and they begged the Lord to allow them to look down into the world. On doing so, they saw nothing but darkness there. Then they were told to write those secrets on a piece of paper, and if the paper were sent down to earth, they would witness a portent. So they did so, and we saw the paper on which the secrets were written sent down from heaven. As it travelled, while it was still in the spiritual world, it shone like a star. But when it fell into the natural world, its light disappeared, growing dimmer as it fell. When it was sent by the angels to gatherings where there were learned and educated members of the clergy and laity, there was heard a murmur from many of them, in which we could distinguish these remarks: 'What is this? Is it anything important? What difference does it make whether we know these things or not? Surely they are mere fabrications of the brain.' Then it looked as if some people were picking up the paper, folding and rolling it up and twisting it between their fingers. Others also seemed to be tearing it up and wanting to trample it underfoot. But they were prevented from committing that crime by the Lord, and the angels were ordered to withdraw it and keep it safe. Because the angels were saddened and thought to themselves, 'How much longer?' they were told:<p>Until a time and times and half a time, <a href="3927/revelation_12_14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>. </p>

848. The angels were exceedingly delighted with both of these conversations, but perceiving a sadness in me, they asked, "Why are you sad?" <p>I said, "Because these mysteries that are now revealed by the Lord, although they surpass in excellence and dignity all the knowledge hitherto divulged, are nevertheless regarded on the earth as of no value." <p>At this the angels were astonished, and besought the Lord to permit them to look down upon the world; and they looked down, and behold, mere darkness was there. And they were told to write these mysteries on paper and the paper would be let down to the earth, and they would see a strange sight. This was done, and behold, the paper on which these mysteries were written being let down from heaven, in its progress while it was still in the spiritual world shone like a star, but when it reached the natural world its light waned, and as it fell was darkened. And when it was let down by the angels into assemblies of learned and accomplished clergy and laymen a murmur of many voices was heard, in which were the words, "What is this? Is it anything? What matters it whether we know these things or not? Are they not mere progeny of the brain?" And the appearance was that some of them took the paper and folded it up and rolled and unrolled it with their fingers, and that others tore it to pieces and wished to trample it under foot. But they were withheld by the Lord from such an outrage, and the angels were directed to withdraw the paper and guard it. And because the angels were thereby saddened, and thought "How long shall this be?" it was said: <p>For a time, and times, and half a time (<a href="3927/revelation_12_14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>). </p>

848. The angels, on hearing all these things, rejoiced greatly; but they perceived that I was sad, and asked the reason. I told them that these truths, revealed by the Lord at this day, are not regarded on earth as of any value, although in excellence and dignity they surpass all knowledge hitherto made known. The angels wondered at this, and besought the Lord that they might be allowed to look down into the world; they did so, and behold, there was only darkness there. They were then told to write those truths on a paper and send it down to the earth, when they would see something wonderful happen. They wrote those things down, and the paper on which they were written was sent down from heaven. In its progress, while it was still in the spiritual world, it shone like a star; but when it passed into the natural world the light was dissipated, and when it fell down it was entirely darkened. When it was directed by the angels to assemblies of learned and erudite clergy and laymen many were heard to mutter such expressions as, "What is this? Does it mean anything? What does it matter whether we know these things or not? They are mere figments of the brain." Some appeared to take the paper and fold it, and to roll it and unroll it with their fingers; while some appeared to tear it in pieces and made to trample it under foot. But they were withheld by the Lord from such an outrage; and the angels were commanded to take the paper back again and protect it. The angels were greatly saddened, and they wondered how long this would continue, so a voice was heard saying:<p>"For a time, and times, and half a time" <a href="3927/revelation_12_14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>. </p>

848. Angeli ex his et illis auditis valde gavisi sunt, sed percipiebant tristitiam in me; et sciscitabant, unde tibi tristitia; dixi, quod Arcana illa hodie a Domino revelata, tametsi excellentia et dignitate excedunt Cognitiones hactenus evulgatas, usque in Terris reputentur sicut non alicujus pretii: hoc mirati sunt Angeli, et petierunt a Domino, ut liceret illis despicere in Mundum, et despexerunt, et ecce merae tenebrae ibi: et dictum illis est, ut scriberentur Arcana illa super Charta, et Charta demitteretur in Terras, et viderent portentum; et factum est ita, et ecce Charta, cui Arcana illa inscripta erant, demissa est e Coelo, et in progressu, dum adhuc erat in Mundo spirituali, lucebat sicut Stella, at dum illa illapsa est in Mundum naturalem, lux disparata est, et sicut decidit, obtenebrata est: et dum ab Angelis demissa est in Caetus, ubi docti et eruditi ex quibusdam Clericis et Laicis, auditum est murmur a multis, in quo erant hae voces, quid hoc; num aliquid; quid refert si illa scimus vel non scimus; nonne sunt foetus Cerebri; et apparebat, sicut aliqui sumerent Chartam, ac plicarent, volverent, et revolverent illam digitis, et quoque sicut aliqui discerperent, et vellent proculcare pedibus; sed a Domino arcebantur ab illo facinore, et mandatum est Angelis, ut retraherent illam et custodirent; et quia Angeli tristes facti sunt, et cogitaverunt quousque hoc, dictum est, USQUE AD TEMPUS ET TEMPORA, ET DIMIDIUM TEMPORIS, <a href="3927/revelation_12_14.htm">Apocalypsis 12:14</a>. </p>
