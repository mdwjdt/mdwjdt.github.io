<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">普遍之爱有三种：天堂之爱、尘世之爱和自我之爱</h4><br />394.以这三种爱为起点来论述，是因为它们具有普遍性，且是其它一切爱的基础，还因为仁爱与其中每一种都有某种共通之处。天堂之爱是指爱主和爱邻。这二者皆以某种服务（或用）为目的，故可被称为对服务（或用）之爱。尘世之爱不仅指喜爱财富和财产，还指喜爱尘世为取悦身体感官而提供的一切事物。如，悦目的美丽，悦耳的和声，悦鼻的芬芳，悦舌的美味，悦肤的抚摸，更不用说漂亮的衣服，舒适的家，聚会，因而这些及其它事物所带来的一切乐趣。自我之爱，不仅指喜爱崇敬、荣耀、名声和显赫，还指喜爱赢得职位，从而统治他人。仁爱与这三种爱的每一种都有某种共通之处，原因在于，就本质而言，仁爱是对服务（或用）之爱。仁爱想对邻人行善，善与服务是一回事。这三种爱的每一种皆视服务为目的：对天堂之爱视属灵的服务为目的；尘世之爱视可被称为文明的属世服务为目的；自我之爱视身体的服务为目的，身体的服务还可被称为居家服务，它们关注自己和自己人。</p>

<p>
394. 有三種愛:對天國,對世界和對自己的愛
<p>以這三種愛為起點來論述, 因為它們是普遍的, 且是其它一切之愛的基礎, 並且義與其中每一種都有相通之處。
<p>對天國的愛, 表示愛主,還有愛鄰舍。二者皆以服務與發揮用處為目的, 因此也可稱為對服務或有用的愛。
<p>對世界的愛, 不僅指愛財富, 還指對世界所提供的一切取悅於身體感官之事物的愛; 例如, 美麗悅人眼目, 和聲取悅耳朵, 香氣取悅鼻子, 美味悅人口舌, 柔軟取悅皮膚。還包括漂亮的衣裳, 寬敞舒適的住宅, 有歸屬感的社會組織, 以及我們由這些和其它事物獲得全部的滿足。
<p>對自己的愛, 不僅指愛尊重,榮譽,名聲和身份, 還包括尋求與獲取職位與權勢, 因而統治他人。
<p>義與這三種愛有某些相通之處, 因為義可被理解為對一切"用"的熱愛。義, 想對鄰舍行善, 與"用"是一回事。以上所述的各種愛都以"用"為各自的目標:對天國的愛, 屬靈之用; 對世界之愛, 屬世之用; 對自己的愛, 身體感官之用, 也是自家或自己人有用。 </p>

394. There Are Three Universal Categories of Love:
<p>Love for Heaven; Love for the World; and Love for Ourselves
<p>We are starting with these three categories of love because they are universal and fundamental to all types of love and because goodwill has something in common with each of the three.
<p>Love for heaven means love for the Lord and also love for our neighbor. Love for heaven could be called love for usefulness, because both love for the Lord and love for our neighbor have usefulness as their goal.
<p>Love for the world is not only love for wealth and possessions but also love for all the things that the world provides that please our physical senses: beauty pleases our eye, harmony pleases our ear, fragrances please our nose, excellent food pleases our palate, soft touches please our skin. It also includes beautiful clothes, spacious accommodations, and social groups to belong to - all the pleasures that we get from these and many other things.
<p>Love for ourselves is not only a love for respect, glory, fame, and status but also a love for seeking and getting high positions and becoming a leader.
<p>Goodwill has something in common with each of these categories of love, because goodwill is by definition a love for usefulness of all kinds. Goodwill wants to do what is good for our neighbor, and goodness is the same as usefulness. Each of the categories of love just mentioned have usefulness as their goal: love for heaven has the goal of being useful in spiritual ways; love for the world has the goal of being useful in earthly ways, which could also be called forms of civil service; and love for ourselves has the goal of being useful in physical ways, which could also be labeled benefits at home for ourselves and our loved ones. </p>

394. I <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
<p>There are three universal loves, the love of heaven, the love of the world, and self-love.<p>These three loves make the starting point, because they are universal and the foundation of all others, and because charity has something in common with each of them. The love of heaven means love to the Lord, and also love towards the neighbour, and since either of these has some service as its end in view, it may be called the love of service. The love of the world is not only the love of wealth and possessions, but also the love of everything the world supplies for the delight of the bodily senses; for instance the beauty that charms the A eyes, the harmony that charms the ears, the fragrance that charms the nose, the delicacies that charm the tongue, the soothing touches that charm the skin, not to mention fine clothes, comfortable homes, parties, and all the pleasures given by these and many other objects. Self-love is not only the love of honours, glory, fame and eminence, but also the love of winning and angling for offices, and thus dominating others. The reason charity has something in common with each of these three loves is that charity regarded in essence is the love of being of service. Charity wants to do good to the neighbour (and good is the same as being of service); and each of these loves has services as its end in view, the love of heaven spiritual services, the love of the world natural services, which can be termed civic, and self-love bodily services, which can also be termed domestic ones for oneself and one's own people.<p>

394. I. THERE ARE THREE UNIVERSAL LOVES-THE LOVE OF HEAVEN, THE LOVE OF THE WORLD, AND THE LOVE OF SELF. <p>These three loves must first be considered for the reason that these three are the universal and fundamental of all loves, and that charity has something in common with each of them. For the love of heaven means both love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor; and as each of these looks to use as its end, the love of heaven may be called the love of uses. The love of the world is not merely a love of wealth and possessions, but is also a love of all that the world affords, and of all that delights the bodily senses, as beauty delights the eye, harmony the ear, fragrance the nostrils, delicacies the tongue, softness the skin; also becoming dress, convenient houses, and society, thus all the enjoyments arising from these and many other objects. The love of self is not merely the love of honor, glory, fame, and eminence, but also the love of meriting and seeking office, and so of ruling over others. Charity has some thing in common with each of these three loves, because viewed in itself charity is the love of uses; for charity wishes to do good to the neighbor, and good and use are the same, and from these loves everyone looks to uses as his end; the love of heaven looking to spiritual uses, the love of the world to natural uses, which may be called civil, and the love of self to corporeal uses, which may also be called domestic uses, that have regard to oneself and one's own. </p>

394. Quod tres Amores universales sint, Amor Coeli, Amor Mundi, et Amor sui.<p>Exordium fit ex tribus his Amoribus, quia sunt universales et fundamentales omnium, et quia Charitas commune habet cum unoquovis ex illis; nam per AMOREM COELI intelligitur amor in Dominum, et quoque Amor erga proximum, et quia uterque ille spectat usum ut finem, vocari potest Amor usuum. AMOR MUNDI non solum est Amor opum et possessionum, sed etiam Amor omnium quae Mundus suppeditat, et delectat Sensus corporis, ut pulchritudo oculos, harmonia aures, fragrantia nares, lautitiae linguam, mulcimina cutem, tum etiam decori amictus, commodae habitationes, consortia, ita omnes jucunditates ex his, et ex pluribus aliis objectis. AMOR SUI non Solum est amor honoris, gloriae, famae, eminentiae, sed etiam amor merendi et ambiendi functiones, et sic regnandi super alios. Quod Charitas commune cum unoquovis ex tribus illis Amoribus habeat, est quia Charitas in se spectata est amor usuum, charitas enim vult proximo facere bonum, et bonum est idem cum usu, et quisque ex illis amoribus usus spectat ut suos fines, Amor Coeli usus spirituales, Amor mundi usus naturales qui nuncupari possunt civiles, et Amor sui usus corporeos, qui etiam nuncupari possunt Domestici pro se et suis. </p>
