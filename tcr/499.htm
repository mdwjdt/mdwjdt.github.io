499. This point should also be illustrated through comparisons, as follows.
<p>No creation could have taken place unless some free choice existed in all things that were created, both animate and inanimate. If animals lacked free choice in earthly matters, they would have no ability to choose the food that was the most nourishing for them, and would not be able to reproduce or protect their offspring; so there would be no animals.
<p>If the fish in the sea or the crustaceans on the sea floor had no freedom, there would be no fish or crustaceans. Likewise, if every little insect had no freedom, there would be no silkworms producing silk, no bees producing honey or wax, no butterflies playing with their partners in the air, feeding on the nectar in flowers, and representing our blessed state in the breezes of heaven after we, like caterpillars, have shed our old skin.
</p>
<p>
[2] Unless there were something analogous to free choice in the soil of the ground, in the seed planted in it, in every part of the tree that germinates from that seed, in its fruits, and again in new seeds, there would be no plants. Unless there were something analogous to free choice in every type of metal and stone, whether noble or base, there would be no metal, no stone, not even a grain of sand. Each of these things freely absorbs ether, exhales its own natural emanation, casts off particles that have broken down, and integrates new particles into itself. This activity results in the magnetic field that surrounds a magnet, the iron field that surrounds iron, the copper field that surrounds copper, the silver field that surrounds silver, the golden field that surrounds gold, the stony field that surrounds stone, the nitrous field that surrounds niter, the sulfuric field that surrounds sulfur, and the fields of various kinds that surround each type of particulate matter on earth. In the case of every seed, these fields penetrate its inmost parts and supply materials for its growth. Without exhalations from every little grain of dust in the earth, the seed would not begin or continue in the process of germination. How else could the earth penetrate into the very center of a seed that has been sown, bringing in water and solid particles, except through materials given off by what surrounds the seed? Take, for example, "a grain of mustard seed, which is the least of all seeds, but when it has grown, it is bigger than all other plants and becomes a large tree" (<a href="3927/matthew_13_32.htm">Matthew 13:32</a>; <a href="3927/mark_4_30.htm">Mark 4:30-32</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] If all created things have been endowed with freedom, then, each according to its own nature, why would we humans not have free choice according to our nature, which is that we are to become spiritual? This is why we have been granted free choice in spiritual matters from the womb even to our last moment in this world, and afterward to eternity. </p>

<p>
499. But this needs further illustration. If all created things, animate as well as inanimate, did not have a kind of free will, no creation would have been possible. For if animals did not have free will in natural matters, they could not select food suitable for their nourishment, they could not reproduce or look after their offspring, so there would be no animals. If the fish of the sea and the shellfish of its floor did not have such freedom, there would be no fish or shellfish. Likewise, if every insect did not have it, there would be no silkworm to produce silk, no bee to produce honey and wax, no butterfly to sport with its mate in the air, feed on the nectar of flowers, and represent man's blessed state in the aura of heaven, when like caterpillar he has shed his outer skin.</p>

<p>
[2] If there were not something analogous to free will in the soil of the ground, the seed put into it, and all parts of the tree growing from it, as well as in its fruits, and repeated in the new seeds, there could be no plants. If every metal and every stone, precious as well as common, did not have something analogous to free will, neither metal nor stone could exist, not even a grain of sand. For even this freely absorbs the ether, breathing out its own effluvium, ridding itself of what is exhausted and renewing itself with new material. This is the source of the magnetic field around a magnet, the iron sphere of influence around a piece of iron, copper around copper, silver around silver, gold around gold, stone around stone, nitrous around nitre, sulphurous around sulphur, and of various kinds around every particle of dust in the ground. This influence impregnates the inmost part of every seed and makes it fertile and grow. For failing such an effluvium from every grain of dust in the earth, there would be no commencement of germination and so no means of perpetuating itself. How else could the earth penetrate with dust and water the inmost centre of a seed sown, except by means of its exhalations; as for instance a mustard seed,<p>Which is smaller than all other seeds, but when it has grown is larger than plants and becomes a great tree, <a href="3927/matthew_13_31.htm">Matthew 13:31-32</a>; <a href="3927/mark_4_30.htm">Mark 4:30-32</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] When then everything created has been endowed with its own kind of freedom, each according to its nature, why should man be denied the free will appropriate to his nature, which is that he should be spiritual? That is why man has been given free will in spiritual matters from the womb to extreme old age in the world, and thereafter for ever. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #499 (Ager, 1970)
</h4>
<p>
499. But this shall be still further illustrated by comparisons, as follows: Without some kind of freedom of choice in all created things, both animate and inanimate, no creation could have taken place; for without freedom of choice in natural things for beasts there would be no choice of food conducive to their nourishment, and no propagation and preservation of offspring; thus, no beasts. If the fishes of the sea and the shellfish at its bottom, had no such freedom, there would be no fish or shellfish. In like manner, unless this freedom were in every insect, there would be no silk-worm yielding silk, no bee furnishing wax and honey, no butterfly sporting with its consort in the air, feeding on the juices of flowers, and representing, after he has shed his exuviae as a worm, the happy state of man in the heavenly realm.
</p>
<p>
[2] Unless there were something analogous to freedom of choice in the earth's soil, in the seed sown in it, in all parts of the tree that has grown out of it, and in its fruit, and again in the new seed, there would be no plant life. Unless there were something analogous to freedom of choice in every metal, and in every stone both precious and common, there would be no metal or stone, or even a grain of sand; for even this freely absorbs the ether, emits its natural exhalations, throws off its worn-out elements and restores itself with new. From this there is a magnetic sphere about the magnet, an iron sphere about iron, a coppery one about copper, a silver sphere about silver, a golden one about gold, a stony sphere about stone, a nitrous sphere about niter, a sulfur sphere about sulfur, and a different sphere about every particle of dust. From this sphere the inmost of every seed is impregnated, and its prolific principle vegetates; for without such an exhalation from every least particle of the earth's dust, there would be no beginning of germination and no continuance of it. How could the earth, except by what is exhaled from it, penetrate with dust and water to the inmost center of a grain sown in it, as into a grain of mustard seed, for example: <p>Which is less than all seeds, but when it is grown, it is greater than herbs, and becometh a tree? (<a href="3927/matthew_13_32.htm">Matthew 13:32</a>; <a href="3927/mark_4_30.htm">Mark 4:30-32</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] Since freedom has been thus implanted in all created subjects, in each according to its nature, why should not freedom of choice have been implanted in man according to his nature, that he may become spiritual? This is the reason that free will in spiritual things is given to man, from the womb to the last hour of his life in the world, and afterward to eternity. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #499 (Dick, 1950)
</h4>
<p>
499. This will be further illustrated by the following comparisons. Unless all created things, both animate and inanimate, possessed some kind of free will, creation could not have been effected; for without free will in natural things among animals there would be no selection of food suitable for their nourishment, no propagation and protection of offspring, and consequently they would cease to exist. If the fish of the sea and the shell-fish in its depths were deprived of this freedom, there would be neither fish nor shell-fish. In like manner, unless every insect was gifted with the same freedom there would be no silk-worm to produce silk, no bee to produce honey and wax, and no butterfly to sport with its partner in the air and feed on the juices in flowers, thus representing the blessed state of man in the heavenly aura, when he, like the insect, has cast off his outer covering.</p>
<p>
[2] Unless there was something analogous to free will in the soil of the earth, in the seed sown therein, and in all parts of the tree grown from it, and in its fruit and also in its now seeds, there would be no plant of any kind. The same is true of every metal and stone, whether precious or worthless; for there would be no such thing as metal, stone or indeed grain of sand, unless each possessed something analogous to free will; for even the grain of sand freely absorbs the ether, exhales its native properties, rejects that for which it has no further use, and renews itself with fresh substances. Thus there is a magnetic sphere around the magnet, and iron, copper, silver, gold, stone, nitre and sulphur, each has its own sphere, and even every speck of dust of the earth in all its variety. From this sphere the inmost of every seed is impregnated, and its prolific principle caused to vegetate. For without this emanation from every particle of the earth's dust there would be neither the beginning of germination nor the consequent continuance of growth. In no other way could the earth penetrate with its solid matter and moisture into the centre of the seed that is sown than by emanations from it; as into a grain of mustard seed,<p>"Which indeed is the least of seeds; but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree" <a href="3927/matthew_13_31.htm">Matthew 13:31-32</a>; <a href="3927/mark_4_30.htm">Mark 4:30-32</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] Since then all created things are endowed with freedom, each according to its nature, why should not man be endowed with free will according to his nature which is, to become spiritual? It may, therefore, be concluded that the enjoyment of free will in spiritual things has been granted to man from birth to the end of his life in this world, and afterwards to eternity. </p>
