650. The Lord Ascribes Goodness to Everyone; Hell Ascribes Evil to Everyone
<p>It is a new concept for the church that the Lord ascribes goodness to us all and ascribes no evil to us, but the Devil (meaning hell) ascribes evil to us all and ascribes no goodness to us. The reason this is new is that in the Word it says many times that God is angry at people, takes revenge, hates them, condemns them, punishes them, throws them into hell, and tests them, all of which actions actually come from evil and are therefore evil things to do. In the chapter on the Sacred Scripture, however, I showed that the literal meaning of the Word was written in what are called apparent truths and correspondences [215, 226, 254, 256-258]. It was written this way to allow for a partnership between the outer church and the inner church, and therefore between the world and heaven. There I also mentioned that when we read things like that in the Word, the apparent truths are turned into genuine truths as they pass over from us into heaven. In this case, the genuine truths are that the Lord is never angry, never takes revenge, never hates us, never condemns us, never punishes us, never throws us into hell, never tests us. He does evil to no one. In the spiritual world I have often witnessed this change and conversion of meaning. </p>

650. VIII. The Lord imputes good to everyone and hell imputes evil to everyone,<p>It is news to the church that the Lord imputes good and never evil to a person, and that the devil (by which is meant hell) imputes evil and never good to him. The reason this is news is that we read in many passages in the Word that God is angry, takes revenge, hates, condemns, punishes, throws someone into hell, tempts him, all of which are the actions of a wicked person, and so are evils. But, as was shown in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture, the literal sense of the Word was composed out of what are called appearances and correspondences. This was in order to link the externals of the church with its internals, and so to link the world with heaven. The same chapter also showed that when such things are read about in heaven, the appearances of truth in their passage from man to heaven are actually changed into genuine truths. These are that the Lord is never angry, never takes revenge, hates, condemns, punishes, throws anyone into hell, or tempts him; thus He never does evil to anyone. I have often observed this transmutation and change in the spiritual world. </p>

650. VIII. THE LORD IMPUTES GOOD TO EVERY MAN, BUT HELL IMPUTES EVIL TO EVERY MAN. <p>That the Lord imputes to man good and not evil, while the devil (meaning hell), imputes evil and not good to him, is a new thing in the church; and it is new for the reason that in the Word it is frequently said that God is angry, takes vengeance, hates, damns, punishes, casts into hell, and tempts, all of which pertain to evil, and therefore are evils. But it has been shown in the chapter on the Sacred Scriptures that the sense of the letter of the Word is composed of such things as are called appearances and correspondences, in order that there may be a conjunction of the external church with its internals, thus of the world with heaven. It is also there shown that when such things in the Word are read these very appearances of truth, while they are passing from man to heaven, are changed into genuine truths, which are that the Lord is never angry, never takes vengeance, never hates, damns, punishes, casts into hell, or tempts, consequently does evil to man. This transmutation and changing in the spiritual world I have frequently observed. </p>

650. VIII. THE LORD IMPUTES GOOD TO EVERY MAN, AND HELL IMPUTES EVIL TO EVERY MAN.<p>The Lord imputes good to man, and not any evil, and the devil, by whom is meant hell, imputes evil to man, and not any good. This truth is new in the Church, because it is frequently said in the Word, that God is angry, that He avenges, hates, condemns, punishes, casts into hell and tempts, which all pertain to evil, and consequently are evils. But the sense of the Letter of the Word is composed of what are called appearances and correspondences, in order that there may be a conjunction of the external Church with its internal, and thus of the world with heaven, as was shown in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture. It was also shown that when such things are read in the Word, the appearances of truth themselves, as they pass from man to heaven, are turned into genuine truths, which are, that the Lord is never angry, that He never avenges, hates, condemns, punishes, casts into hell or tempts; consequently that He does evil to no man. This change and turning I have often observed in the spiritual world. </p>

650. Quod Dominus omni homini imputet bonum, et quod Infernum omni homini imputet malum.<p>Quod Dominus imputet homini bonum, et non aliquod malum, et quod diabolus, per quem intelligitur Infernum, imputet homini malum, et non aliquod bonum, est novum in Ecclesia; quod sit novum, est quia in Verbo pluries legitur, quod Deus irascatur, ulciscatur, odio habeat, damnet, puniat, conjiciat in infernum, tentet, quae omnia sunt mali, et inde mala: sed quod sensus literae Verbi ex talibus, quae vocantur apparentiae et correspondentiae, conscriptum sit, propter causam, ut sit conjunctio Externae Ecclesiae <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
cum Interna ejus, ita Mundi cum Coelo, in Capite de SCRIPTURA SACRA ostensum est; et ibi etiam, quod cum talia in Verbo leguntur, ipsae apparentiae veri, dum transeunt ab homine ad Coelum, vertantur in genuina vera, quae sunt, quod Dominus nusquam irascatur, ulciscatur, odio habeat, damnet, puniat, conjiciat in infernum, tentet, proinde quod nulli homini faciat malum; hanc transmutationem et versuram in Mundo Spirituali saepius animadverti.<p>
