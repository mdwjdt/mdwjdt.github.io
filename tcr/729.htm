729. Now, people who die as children and teenagers and do not reach the age at which they could come forward worthily to take the Holy Supper are made a part of heaven by the Lord through their baptism instead. The chapter on baptism has shown that baptism brings people into the Christian church and at the same time brings them into the company of Christians in the spiritual world [677-680]. In that world, the church and heaven are one. Therefore making these young ones a part of the church is also making them a part of heaven. Because they are raised under the Lord's supervision, they are regenerated more and more and become his children; they do not recognize anyone else as their parent.
<p>As for children and teenagers who were born outside the Christian church, once they develop faith in the Lord, they are made part of the heaven that is designated for their religion, but they come there through a different means than baptism. They do not mix with people who are in the Christian heaven.
<p>There is no such thing as a race of people anywhere on the entire planet who cannot be saved if they acknowledge God and live good lives. The Lord redeems all such people. We are all born spiritual by nature and therefore we all have a capacity for receiving the gift of redemption.
<p>People who accept the Lord, that is, who have faith in him and do not practice evil in their lives, are called "children of God" and "those born of God" (<a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>; <a href="3927/john_11_52.htm">11:52</a>). They are also called "children of the kingdom" (<a href="3927/matthew_13_38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a>) and "heirs" (<a href="3927/matthew_19_29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">25:34</a>). The Lord's disciples are also called "children" (<a href="3927/john_13_33.htm">John 13:33</a>), and so are all the angels (<a href="3927/job_1_6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="3927/job_2_1.htm">2:1</a>). </p>

729. Those, however, who die in infancy or childhood, before reaching an age at which they can worthily approach the Holy Supper, are introduced into heaven by the Lord by means of baptism. For, as was shown in the chapter on this subject, baptism means being introduced into the Christian church, and at the same time being given a place among the Christians in the spiritual world. The church and heaven are there one. Consequently being introduced into the church means also into heaven. Those who die in childhood, being brought up under the Lord's guidance, are more and more regenerated and become His sons, for they know no other father.<p>Infants and children, however, who were born outside the Christian church are brought by other means than baptism into the heaven planned for their religion, once they have accepted faith in the Lord; but they are not allowed to mix with those who are in the Christian heaven. For there is no nation in the whole world which cannot be saved, if it acknowledges God and lives a good life. For the Lord has redeemed all of these, and man is by birth spiritual, a fact which gives him the ability to receive the gift of redemption. Those who receive the Lord, that is, who have faith in Him and do not lead wicked lives, are called 'sons of God' and 'born of God' (<a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>; <a href="3927/john_11_52.htm">11:52</a>); also , sons of the kingdom' (<a href="3927/matthew_13_38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a>), and also 'heirs' (<a href="3927/matthew_19_29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">25:34</a>). The Lord's disciples are also called children (<a href="3927/john_13_33.htm">John 13:33</a>) and so are all the angels (<a href="3927/job_1_6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="3927/job_2_1.htm">2:1</a>). </p>

729. But those who die in infancy or childhood, not reaching the age at which they can come worthily to the holy supper, are introduced into heaven by the Lord through baptism; for baptism (as has been shown in the chapter on Baptism), is introduction into the Christian church, and also insertion among Christians in the spiritual world; and there the church and heaven are one; therefore to those who are there, introduction into the church is also introduction into heaven; and as they are there educated under the auspices of the Lord, they become more and more regenerate, and become His children; for they know no other Father. But children and youths born outside of the Christian church are introduced when they have received faith in the Lord, into the heaven assigned to their religion by other means than baptism; and are not mingled with those who are in the Christian heaven. For there is not a nation in all the world that may not be saved if it acknowledges God and lives well; for they have all been redeemed by the Lord, and man is by birth spiritual, whereby he has an ability to receive the gift of redemption. Those who receive the Lord, that is, have faith in Him, and do not lead an evil life, are called: <p>Sons of God, and born of God (<a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>; <a href="3927/john_11_52.htm">11:52</a>); <p>Also children of the kingdom (<a href="3927/matthew_13_38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a>); <p>And again heirs (<a href="3927/matthew_19_29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">25:34</a>); <p>The Lord's disciples are also called sons (<a href="3927/john_13_33.htm">John 13:33</a>); <p>And so are all angels (<a href="3927/job_1_6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="3927/job_2_1.htm">2:1</a>). </p>

729. Those, however, who die in infancy or childhood, and approach the Holy Supper, are introduced into heaven by the Lord through Baptism; for as was shown in the chapter on Baptism, "Baptism is an introduction into the Christian Church, and at the same time an insertion among Christians in the spiritual world." Now the Church and heaven in the spiritual world are one; and, therefore, for those who are there, introduction into the Church is also introduction into heaven. As those who die in infancy or childhood are educated under the guidance of the Lord, they continually advance in regeneration and become His sons, for they know no other Father.<p>Infants and children, however, who are born outside the Christian Church, are, after they have received faith in the Lord, introduced by other means than Baptism into the heaven appointed for those of their religion; but they do not mingle with those who are in the Christian heaven. Indeed all nations throughout the whole world can be saved, if they acknowledge God and live aright; for the Lord has redeemed them all; and as every man is born spiritual, he thus has the faculty of receiving the gift of redemption. Those who receive the Lord, that is, who have faith in Him and are not in evils of life, are called:<p>"Sons of God" and "born of God," <a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>; <a href="3927/john_11_52.htm">11:52</a>; and "children of the kingdom," <a href="3927/matthew_13_38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a>; and also "heirs," <a href="3927/matthew_19_29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">25:34</a>;<p>The Lord's disciples are also called "children," <a href="3927/john_13_33.htm">John 13:33</a>; and so are all the angels, <a href="3927/job_1_8.htm">Job 1:8</a>; <a href="3927/job_2_1.htm">2:1</a>. </p>

729. Illi autem qui in infantia aut pueritia decedunt, et sic non attingunt aetatem, ut digne possint ad Sanctam Coenam accedere, a Domino introducuntur per Baptismum, nam, ut in Capite de Baptismo ostensum est, Baptismus est introductio in Ecclesiam Christianam, et simul tunc insertio inter Christianos in Mundo spirituali; ac Ecclesia et Coelum ibi unum sunt, quare pro illis ibi introductio in Ecclesiam, est quoque in Coelum, et hi, quia sub auspicio Domini educantur, plus et plus regenerantur, et fiunt filii Ipsius; non enim alium Patrem norunt. Infantes autem et pueri, nati extra Ecclesiam Christianam, per aliud medium, quam per Baptismum, in Coelum Religioni illorum designatum, post receptionem fidei in Dominum, introducuntur, sed non commiscentur illis, qui in Coelo Christiano sunt. Non enim datur ulla gens in universo terrarum orbe, quae non salvari potest, si agnoscit Deum, et bene vivit; Dominus enim redemit omnes hos, et homo natus est spiritualis, per quod illi est facultas recipiendi donum redemptionis. Illi qui Dominum recipiunt, hoc est, fidem in Ipsum habent, et non in malis vitae sunt, vocantur FILII DEI, et NATI a Deo, <a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">Johannes 1:12-13</a>; <a href="3927/john_11_52.htm">11:52</a> tum FILII REGNI, <a href="3927/matthew_13_38.htm">Matthaeus 13:38</a>: et quoque HAEREDES, <a href="3927/matthew_19_29.htm">Matthaeus 19:29</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_25_3.htm">25:3</a>4, DISCIPULI DOMINI etiam vocantur FILII, <a href="3927/john_13_33.htm">Johannes 13:33</a>; <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
