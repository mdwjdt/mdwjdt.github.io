830. The real Muhammad, who wrote the Qur'an, is not seen in public these days. I have been told that in the beginning he was in charge of the Muslim population in the spiritual world, but because he wanted to exercise control over every aspect of their religious life as if he himself were God, he was removed from his home, which was next to the Catholic region, and sent down and to the right, near the southern region.
<p>Some years ago, ill-intentioned people managed to convince one community of Muslims to acknowledge Muhammad as God. In order to put a stop to this development, Muhammad was brought up from the lower earth and shown to people. I, too, saw him at that time. He looked much like the bodily spirits who have no inner consciousness. His face was almost pitch black. I heard him say, "I am your Muhammad"; then he sank back down again. </p>

830. The real Mohammed who wrote the Koran is not to be seen at the present time. I was told that in the earliest times he was set over them, but because he wanted to control everything in their religion as God, he was thrown out of the residence he had below the Roman Catholics and sent down to the right near the south. On one occasion a community of Mohammedans was stirred up by malicious spirits to acknowledge Mohammed as God. In order to quell this revolt Mohammed was brought up from the lower earth and displayed to them, and I too was then able to see him. He looked like the bodily spirits who lack any interior power of perception, his face dark and almost black. I heard him speak the words 'I am your Mohammed,' and shortly afterwards he seemed to sink down again. </p>

830. The Mohammed who wrote the Koran is not seen at the present day. I was told that in former times he presided over them; but because he desired to rule as God over all things pertaining to their religion he was ejected from his seat, which he had beneath the Papists, and was sent down to the right side near the south. A certain society of Mohammedans was once incited by some malicious spirits to acknowledge Mohammed as God. To quiet this disturbance, Mohammed was brought up from the lower earth and shown to them; and at that time I also saw him. He looked like those corporeal spirits who have no interior perception, with a face inclined to black. I heard him utter these words, "I am your Mohammed;" and immediately he seemed to sink down. </p>

830. The real Mohammed who wrote the Koran is not at this day to be seen among them. I was informed that at first he presided over them; but because he desired to rule over all things pertaining to their religion as a god, he was deposed from his seat beneath the Roman Catholics, and sent away southward to the right. A certain society of Mohammedans was once instigated by some evil spirits to acknowledge Mohammed as God. To quell the revolt Mohammed was brought up from the earth beneath, and was shown to them; and on this occasion I also saw him. In appearance he was like the corporeal spirits who have no interior perception; his face was turning to black; and I just heard him saying these words, "I am your Mohammed;" and presently he seemed to sink down again. </p>

830. Ipse Mahumedes, qui scripsit Alcoranum, non in conspectum hodie venit; dictum mihi est, quod primis temporibus praefuerit illis, sed quia voluit dominari super omnia Religionis illorum ut Deus, quod e sede sua, quam sub Pontificiis habuit, ejectus sit, et ad latus dextrum juxta meridiem demissus. Quondam aliqua Societas ex Mahumedanis excitata est a malitiosis ad agnoscendum Mahumedem pro Deo; ut seditio sedaretur, sublatus est Mahumedes ab infera terra, et ostensus, et tunc quoque mihi visus est: apparuit similis Spiritibus corporeis, quibus non perceptio interior est, facie ad nigrum vergente, et audivi illum loquentem haec verba, Ego sum Mahumedes vester; et mox quasi subsidens. </p>
