626. Chapter 11: The Assignment of Spiritual Credit or Blame
<p>The Faith of the Church of Today, Which Is Claimed to Be the Sole Thing That Makes Us Just, and the Belief That Christ's Merit Is Assigned to Us Amount to the Same Thing
<p>The faith of the church of today, which is claimed to be the sole basis of our justification, is the belief that Christ's merit is assigned to us; that is, the two concepts amount to the same thing. This is because each belongs to the other or is a part of the other and supports the other's existence.
<p>If you mention faith but you do not include the idea of an assigning, the word "faith" is just a meaningless sound. By the same token, if you mention an assigning but you forget to mention faith, that too is a meaningless sound. If the two are mentioned together, however, now the sounds start to form a phrase, although understanding will still not occur. To engage the intellect, it is necessary to add a third element: the merit of Christ. Now you have a sentence that can be uttered with some rationality, because the faith of the church of today is that God the Father assigns us the justice of his Son and sends the Holy Spirit to produce its effects. </p>

626. CHAPTER ELEVEN<p>IMPUTATION<p>I. The faith of the present-day church, which is held to be the sole requirement for justification, is one with imputation.<p>The faith of the present-day church, which is held to be the sole requirement for justification, is one with imputation; in other words, faith and imputation in the present-day church make a single whole. This is because one involves the other, and one enters into the other, and the other into the first, and causes it to exist. For if one talks of faith without adding imputation, faith is simply a meaningless sound; and if one talks of imputation without adding faith, this too is simply a meaningless sound. Even if the two are spoken of linked together, they become an articulated expression, though still devoid of intelligible meaning. For the understanding to grasp any real meaning in it, a third term needs to be added, Christ's merit. This produces a concept that one can utter with some degree of reasonableness. For it is the faith of the present-day church that God the Father imputes the righteousness of His Son, and sends the Holy Spirit to bring about its effects. </p>

626. CHAPTER 11 <p>IMPUTATION. <p>I. IMPUTATION AND THE FAITH OF THE PRESENT CHURCH (WHICH IS HELD TO BE THE SOLE GROUND OF JUSTIFICATION), MAKE ONE. <p>The faith of the present church, which is held to be the sole ground of justification, is imputation; that is, in the present church, faith and imputation make one, because each belongs to the other, or each mutually and interchangeably enters into the other and causes it to be. For if faith is mentioned and imputation is not added faith is mere sound; and if imputation is mentioned and faith is not added imputation is mere sound; but when the two are mentioned together, the result is something articulate, and yet without meaning; and in order that the understanding may have a perception of some thing, a third must necessarily be added, namely, Christ's merit. These form a statement that a man can utter with some reason. For it is the faith of the present church that God the Father imputes His Son's righteousness, and sends the Holy Spirit to work out its effects. </p>

626. CHAPTER XI<p>IMPUTATION<p>I. IMPUTATION IS ONE WITH THE PRESENT CHURCH'S FAITH WHICH, IT IS HELD, ALONE JUSTIFIES.<p>The faith of the present Church which, it is held, alone justifies, is imputation, or that faith and imputation in the present Church are one, because the one pertains to the other, or enters mutually and reciprocally into the other, and is the cause of its existence. For if faith is spoken of without the addition of imputation, it is merely a sound; and if imputation is spoken of without the addition of faith, it also is merely a sound; and even when taken together, although something distinct is the result, still they convey nothing to the understanding. In order, then, that the understanding may perceive some meaning, a third factor must be added, namely, the merit of Christ. Now this meaning may be expressed with some appearance of reason, as in the faith of the present Church, that God the Father imputes the righteousness of His Son, and sends the Holy Spirit to work out its effects. </p>

626. CAPUT UNDECIMUM<p>DE IMPUTATIONE.<p>Quod Fides hodiernae Ecclesiae, quae perhibetur sola justificare, et Imputatio, unum faciant.<p>Quod Fides hodiernae Ecclesiae, quae perhibetur sola justificare, sit Imputatio, seu quod fides et imputatio in hodierna Ecclesia unum faciant, est quia unum est alterius, seu unum ingreditur alterum mutuo et vicissim, et facit ut sit, si enim dicitur fides et non adjicitur imputatio, fides est mere sonus, et si dicitur imputatio, et non adjicitur fides, est quoque mere sonus, at si duo illa dicuntur conjunctim, fit articulatum quid, sed adhuc absque intellectu, quare ut intellectus percipiat aliquid, necessario adjicietur tertium, quod est meritum Christi, inde fit sententia, quam homo potest eloqui cum aliqua ratione: fides enim hodiernae Ecclesiae est, quod Deus Pater imputet justitiam Filii sui, et mittat spiritum Sanctum ad operandum effectus ejus. </p>
