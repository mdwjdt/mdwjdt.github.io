602. 但必须知道, 人的觉知能上升, 几乎到达天堂天人所在的光明, 但除非他的意愿也上升, 否则他仍是旧人, 而非新人。 我之前说明了, 觉知如何将意愿提升到更高层, 直到与它自己相匹配。 因此, 重生主要取决于意愿, 其次取决于觉知。 因为人的觉知类似世上的光, 而意愿类似世上的热。 众所周知, 没有热的光不会使万物存活并生长, 唯有与热结合的光才行。 此外, 在心智的较低区域, 觉知实际上处于尘世之光, 而在较高区域, 则处于天堂之光。 故, 除非意愿从较低区域被提升至较高区域, 并在那里与觉知结合, 否则它仍停留在尘世, 然后觉知上下翻飞, 但每晚都沉到下面的意愿, 并在那里安歇, 它们就象男人和妓女一样交合, 然后生出双头的后代。 这些事实也清楚表明, 除非人获得一个新的意愿和一个新的觉知, 否则他并未重生。 </p>

602. It is important to note, however, that our intellect can rise up almost into the light that the angels of heaven have, but if our will does not rise along with it, we are still the old self, not the new self. (I have already shown how the intellect lifts the will up with itself, higher and higher.) For this reason, regeneration is primarily a matter of the will, and only secondarily a matter of the intellect. The intellect in us is like light in the world, and our will is like the heat here. Without heat, light brings nothing to life and makes nothing grow; as we know, light has to act in partnership with heat. The intellect that is in the lower part of the mind is actually in the light of this world; the intellect that is in the higher part of the mind is in the light of heaven. Therefore if our will is not lifted up from the lower region into the higher region to join the intellect, it remains at the level of the world. Then our intellect flies up and down, up and down. Every night, though, it flies down and sleeps with our will below, and the two make love like a married man and a whore and bring forth two-headed offspring.
<p>Again, it is clear that if we do not have a new will and a new intellect, we have not been regenerated. </p>

602. It needs to be known that a person as regards his understanding can rise almost into the light enjoyed by the angels of heaven. But if he does not also rise as regards his will, he is still the old person, not a new one. I showed earlier how the understanding raises the will to an even higher level to match itself. Regeneration, therefore, is primarily a matter of the will, secondarily of the understanding. For a person's understanding resembles light in the world, his will heat there. It is well known that light without heat does not make things live and grow, but only light combined with heat. In respect of the lower region of the mind the understanding really is enlightened by the light of the world, but in respect of the upper region by the light of heaven. Therefore unless the will is raised from the lower region to the upper and is there linked to the understanding, it remains in the world. Then the understanding swoops up and down, but every night sinks down to the will and rests there; and they couple like a man with a whore, and bring forth offspring with two heads. These facts too make it plain that unless a person acquires a new will and a new understanding, he has not been regenerated. </p>

602. But it must be understood that while man may rise as to his understanding almost into the light in which the angels of heaven are, unless he rises also as to his will, he is still the old and not a new man. But it has been shown already how the understanding elevates the will more and more to the same height with itself. For this reason regeneration is predicated primarily of the will, and secondarily of the understanding. For the understanding in man is like light in the world, and the will is like the heat there; and it is known that light without heat does not vivify or cause vegetation, but light joined with heat. Moreover, as to the lower region of the mind, the understanding is actually in the light of the world, while as to the higher region it is in the light of heaven; consequently if the will is not raised from the lower region into the higher, and there conjoined with the understanding, it remains in the world; and then the understanding flies upward and downward, but returns every night to the will below and sleeps there; and they unite like a man and a harlot, and beget two-headed offspring. From all this it is clear that unless a man has a new will and a new understanding, he is not regenerated. </p>

602. It should be known, however, that a man, as to his understanding, can ascend almost into the light which the angels of heaven enjoy; but unless he ascends also as to his will, he is still the old man and not the new. It was shown above how the understanding raises the will more and more to the same level with itself. It is on this account that regeneration is predicated primarily of the will, and secondarily of the understanding; for the understanding in man is like the light in the world, and the will like the heat there; and it is well known that light without heat does not vivify and promote growth, but that this is the result of light in conjunction with heat. The understanding also, as to the lower region of the mind, is actually in the light of the world, and as to the higher region, in the light of heaven; and therefore, if the will is not raised from the lower region into the higher, and there united with the understanding, it remains in the world. The understanding then flies upwards and downwards; but every night it descends to the will beneath and there comes to rest, and their union, like that of husband and courtesan, produces ill-favored offspring. From this, it is evident that unless a man has a new will and a new understanding he is not regenerated. </p>

602. At sciendum est, quod homo quoad intellectum assurgere possit paene in lucem, in qua sunt Angeli Coeli, sed si non etiam assurgit quoad voluntatem, usque est vetus homo, et non novus: quomodo autem intellectus elevat voluntatem in altitudinem secum plus et plus, prius ostensum est; quare regeneratio primario praedicatur de voluntate, et secundario de intellectu: nam intellectus apud hominem est sicut lux in Mundo, et voluntas sicut calor ibi; quod lux absque calore non vivificet et vegetet, sed lux conjuncta calori, notum est; intellectus etiam quoad inferiorem regionem in mente, est etiam actualiter in luce Mundi, et in luce coeli quoad superiorem, quare nisi voluntas elevetur e regione inferiore in superiorem, et ibi conjungitur intellectui, manet in Mundo, et tunc intellectus volat sursum et deorsum, at omni nocte ad voluntatem infra, ac ibi cubat, et se conjungunt sicut vir et scortum, et pariunt foetus bicipites. Ex his etiam patet, quod nisi homini nova voluntas et novus intellectus sit, non regeneratus sit. </p>
