<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>384</b>.⑵在基督教界，凡弃绝主与圣言的人都没有信，哪怕他们生活道德，甚至有关信的言论、教导和着述都很理性。这一点作为结论可从前面所述推知。因为前面已说明，独一正信是信主，并出自主，不信祂、也不是来自祂的信并非属灵之信，而是属世之信；纯属世之信本身并不包含信的本质。此外，信只来自圣言，并非来自其它源头。因为圣言来自主，主自己在圣言中；这就是为何主说祂就是圣言（Word，又译为“道”）（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">约翰福音1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.2.htm">2</a>）。由此可知，人若弃绝圣言，就是弃绝主，因为祂们合而为一。由此还可知，弃绝任一个，也是弃绝教会，因为教会通过圣言来自主；而且，那些弃绝教会的人都在天堂之外，因为教会通往天堂的道路。在天堂之外的人在被诅咒之列，他们根本没有信。<br />凡弃绝主与圣言的人都没有信，哪怕他们生活道德，甚至有关信的言论、教导和着述都很理性。原因在于，这种人没有属灵的生活，只有属世的道德生活，没有属灵、只有属世的理性心智；道德和理性若完全属世，本质上是死的。因为是死的，所以这些人不可能有信。人若全然属世，在关于信方面是死的，固然能谈论并教导有关信、仁和神之事，但并非受信、仁或神的驱使。唯有信主之人才拥有信，其他人则没有。这一点从以下经文明显可知：<br />信祂的人，不被定罪；不信的人，罪已经定了，因为他不信神独生子的名。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.18.htm">约翰福音3:18</a>）<br />信子的有永生；不信子的人不得见永生，神的震怒常在他身上。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.36.htm">约翰福音3:36</a>）<br />耶稣说，等到真理的圣灵来了，祂要审查世人的罪，因为不信我。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.8.htm">约翰福音16:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.9.htm">9</a>）<br />对犹太人说：<br />你们若不信我是，就要死在罪里。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.24.htm">约翰福音8:24</a>）<br />为此，大卫说：<br />我要传圣旨。耶和华曾对我说，你是我的儿子，我今日生你。当以嘴亲子，恐怕祂发怒，你们便在道中灭亡。凡制造他的，都是有福的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗2.7.htm">诗篇2:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗2.12.htm">12</a>）<br />主在福音书中预言，在时代的末了，将没有信，因为不再信主为神的儿子、天地之神、与父为一；时代的末了是指教会的末期，就是祂所说“那行毁坏可憎者”到来之际，从没有这样的灾难，后来也必没有；日头变黑，月亮也不放光，众星要从天上坠落（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.15.htm">马太福音24:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.29.htm">29</a>）。启示录中也说到，撒旦从监牢里被释放，出来迷惑地上四方的列国，他们的人数多如海沙（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.7.htm">启示录20:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.8.htm">8</a>）。主已预见这一切，故祂还说：<br />然而人子来的时候，遇得见世上有信的吗？（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.8.htm">路加福音18:8</a>）</p>

<p>
384. (2)基督徒世界中棄絕主與聖言的人都沒有信, 哪怕他們活出道德的生活, 合理地談論,教導與書寫, 甚至涉及的主題為信。
<p>從先前闡述的內容可得出這樣的總結, 之前說過:唯一的真信, 是信主, 也來自於主。不是信祂, 也不是來自祂的信, 並非屬靈之信, 而是屬世之信; 純粹屬世之信之中缺乏信的本質。
<p>而且, 信從聖言而來, 除此之外並無來源。因為聖言由主而來, 主自己在聖言之中; 這就是為何主說祂就是聖言(Word, 和合本译为"道")(<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">約翰福音1:1-2</a>)。結果可知, 人若棄絕聖言, 也就是棄絕主, 因為祂們組成牢不可破的整體。還可得出, 凡是棄絕其中之一, 也就是棄絕教會, 因為教會通過聖言從主而來。
<p>而且, 棄絕教會者在天國之外, 因為是教會帶人進天國。在天國之外的人在被詛咒之列, 他們根本沒有信。
<p>棄絕主與聖言者都沒有信, 哪怕他們活出道德的生活, 合理地談論,教導與書寫, 甚至涉及的主題為信, 原因在於:他們沒有屬靈的,只有屬世的道德生活, 沒有屬靈的,只有屬世的理性頭腦。道德與理性若完全屬世, 本質上是死的。因為是死的, 所以沒有信。
<p>人若全然屬世, 在關於信方面是死的, 雖然他能夠談論並教導關於信,義與上帝之事, 但並非因著信,義與上帝的驅動來談論與教導。
<p>唯有信主之人才擁有信, 其它人則沒有, 參看以下經文:信祂的人, 不被定罪; 不信的人, 罪已經定了, 因為他不信上帝獨生子的名(<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">約翰福音3:18</a>)。信子的有永生; 不信子的人得不得見永生, 上帝的震怒常在他身上(<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">約翰福音3:36</a>)。耶穌說:"真理之靈來到, 祂將審查世人的罪, 因為不信我"(<a href="3927/john_16_8.htm">約翰福音16:8</a>)。對猶太人, 主說:"你們若不信我是, 就要死在罪裡"(<a href="3927/john_8_24.htm">約翰福音8:24</a>)。為此, 大衛說:"我要傳聖旨。耶和華曾對我說:'你是我的兒子, 我今日生你。'當以嘴親子, 恐怕祂發怒, 你們便在道中滅亡。凡製造他的, 都是有福的"(<a href="3927/psalms_2_7.htm">詩篇2:7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_2_12.htm">12</a>)。
<p>主在福音書中預言, 在時代的末了, 將沒有信, 因為不再信主為上帝之子,信祂為天地之上帝,信祂與父為一。時代的末了是指教會的末期, 就是祂所說的"行毀壞可憎者"到來之際, 那時的災難從未發生,後來必沒有。那時, 太陽變黑, 月亮不發光, 眾星要從天上墜落(<a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">馬太福音24:15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">29</a>)。『啟示錄』中也說到, 撒旦從監牢裡被釋放, 出來迷惑地上四方的列國, 他們的人數多如海沙(<a href="3927/revelation_20_7.htm">啟示錄20:7-8</a>)。因為主已預見此事, 祂還說:"然而人子來的時候, 遇得見世上有信嗎？"(<a href="3927/luke_18_8.htm">路加福音18:8</a>) </p>

384. (b) All people in Christianity who are dismissive of the Lord and the Word have no faith, no matter how morally they behave or how rationally they speak, teach, or write, even if their subject is faith. This follows as a conclusion from everything that has just been said: that the one only true faith is faith in the Lord, from the Lord; that any faith that is not faith in him and from him is earthly faith, not spiritual faith; and that faith that is merely earthly lacks the essence of faith inside it.
<p>Faith comes from the Word. It has no other source, because the Word is from the Lord and therefore the Lord himself is in the Word. This is why the Lord says that he is the Word (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>). As a result, people who are dismissive of the Word are also dismissive of the Lord, for the two are connected as one thing. It also follows that those who are dismissive of either the Lord or the Word are dismissive of the church, since the church comes from the Lord through the Word.
<p>Furthermore, those who are dismissive of the church are outside heaven, because the church is what brings people into heaven. People who are outside heaven are among the damned, and the damned have no faith.
<p>People who are dismissive of the Lord and the Word have no faith no matter how morally they behave or how rationally they speak, teach, or write, even if their subject is faith, because they do not live a spiritual moral life and they do not have a spiritual rational mind. All they have is an earthly moral life and an earthly rational mind, and morality and rationality that are earthly are intrinsically dead. Because such people are dead, they have no faith.
<p>People who are merely earthly and are dead in relation to faith are indeed able to speak and teach about faith, goodwill, and God, but they cannot speak and teach from faith, goodwill, and God.
<p>The only people who have faith are those who believe in the Lord. Others have no faith, as is clear from the following passages: "Those who believe in the Son are not judged; but those who do not believe have already been judged because they have not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God" (<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>). "Those who believe in the Son have eternal life. Those who do not believe in the Son will not see life; instead God's anger will remain upon them" (<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>). "Jesus said, 'When the Spirit of Truth has come, it will convict the world of sin because they do not believe in me'" (<a href="3927/john_16_8.htm">John 16:8-9</a>). And to the Jews the Lord said, "Unless you have believed that I am [he], you will die in your sins" (<a href="3927/john_8_24.htm">John 8:24</a>). This is why David says, "I will announce a decision. Jehovah said, 'You are my Son. Today I fathered you. ' Kiss the Son or he will be angry and you will perish on the way. Blessed are all those who trust in him" (<a href="3927/psalms_2_7.htm">Psalms 2:7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_2_12.htm">12</a>).
<p>In the Gospels the Lord predicted that at the close of the age (meaning the last period of the church) there would be no faith because there would be no belief in the Lord as the Son of God, as the God of heaven and earth, and as someone who is one with the Father: "The abomination of desolation will come, and an affliction such as has never existed before and never will again. The sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven" (<a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">29</a>). And in the Book of Revelation: "Satan will be released from his prison. He will go out to lead astray the nations that are in the four corners of the earth, whose number is like the sand of the sea" (<a href="3927/revelation_20_7.htm">Revelation 20:7-8</a>). Because the Lord foresaw this, he also said, "But when the Son of Humankind comes, is he going to find faith on the earth?' (<a href="3927/luke_18_8.htm">Luke 18:8</a>). </p>

384. (ii) All those in the Christian world have no faith who reject the Lord and the Word, although they live moral lives, and talk, teach and write rationally, even about faith.<p>This follows as the conclusion to be drawn from all that has been said before. For it was shown that the true and only faith is in the Lord and comes from the Lord, and that faith which is not in Him and from Him is not spiritual, but natural faith; and a purely natural faith does not contain in itself the essence of faith. Moreover, faith is from the Word and from no other source. This is because the Word is from the Lord and so the Lord Himself is in the Word; which is why He says that He is the Word (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>). From this it follows that those who reject the Word also reject the Lord, since they make an indissoluble whole. It also follows that those who reject one or the other of these also reject the church, because the church is from the Lord by means of the Word; and further, that those who reject the church are outside heaven, because the church is the way into heaven, Those who are outside heaven are among the damned, and these have no faith at all.<p>The reason why those who reject the Lord and the Word have no faith, although they live moral lives and speak, teach and write rationally, even about faith, is that they have no spiritual, but only natural moral life, and no spiritual but only a natural rational mind; and morality and rationality which are wholly natural are in essence dead. So, being dead, these people cannot have any faith. A person who is wholly natural, who is dead so far as faith is concerned, can certainly talk and teach about faith, charity and God, but not under the impulse of faith, charity or God.</p>
<p>
[2] The following passages prove that faith is possessed only by those who believe in the Lord, and that the rest have none:<p>He who believes in the Son is not judged; but he who does not believe has already been judged, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God, <a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>.<p>He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; but he who does not believe in the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God rests upon him, <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>.<p>Jesus said, When the Spirit of truth comes, He will try the world concerning sin, for not believing in me, <a href="3927/john_16_8.htm">John 16:8-9</a>.<p>And addressing the Jews:<p>If you do not believe that I am, you will die in your sins, <a href="3927/john_8_24.htm">John 8:24</a>.<p>For this reason David says:<p>I will bring news of a decree, said Jehovah. You are my son, to-day have I begotten you. Kiss the son, so that he may not be angry and so that you do not perish on the way. Blessed are all who trust in him, <a href="3927/psalms_2_7.htm">Psalms 2:7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_2_12.htm">12</a>.<p>The Lord predicts in the Gospels that at the ending of the age there will be no faith, because there will be none in the Lord as the Son of God, God of heaven and earth and one with the Father; the ending of the age means the final period of the church, when He says that the abomination of desolation will come about, and affliction such as has never been nor shall be; and that the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky (<a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">29</a>). Also in Revelation, that Satan when released from his imprisonment will go out to lead astray the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, and whose number is like the sand of the sea (<a href="3927/revelation_20_7.htm">Revelation 20:7-8</a>). Because the Lord foresaw this, He also said:<p>Yet when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith upon the earth? <a href="3927/luke_18_8.htm">Luke 18:8</a>. </p>

This follows as a conclusion from all that precedes; for it has been shown that the true and only faith is faith in the Lord and from the Lord, and that a faith that is not a faith in and from Him, is not a spiritual but a natural faith, and merely natural faith has not the essence of faith in it. Moreover, faith is from the Word; it is from no other source, since the Word is from the Lord, and consequently the Lord Himself is the Word. Therefore He says, <p>That He is the Word (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1, 2</a>). <p>From this it follows that those who reject the Word, reject the Lord also, for these cohere as one; also that those who reject either of these also reject the church, since the church is from the Lord through the Word; and furthermore, that those who reject the church are outside of heaven, since the church introduces into heaven; and those who are outside of heaven are among the damned, and these have no faith. Those who reject the Lord and the Word have no faith, although they live morally, and even speak, teach, and write rationally about faith, for the reason that such have no moral-spiritual life, but only a natural life, and no rational-spiritual mind, but only a natural mind; and merely natural morality and rationality are in themselves dead; therefore as dead men there is no faith in them. A man who is merely natural and in regard to faith is dead may indeed talk and teach about faith, charity, and God, but not from faith, charity, and God. That those alone have faith who believe in the Lord, and that others have not, is evident from the following passages: <p>He that believeth on the Son is not judged; but he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God (<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>). <p>He that believeth in the Son hath eternal life but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the anger of God abideth on him (<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>). <p>Jesus said, When the Spirit of truth is come, He will reprove the world of sin, because they believe not on Me (<a href="3927/john_16_8.htm">John 16:8, 9</a>); <p>and to the Jews He said: <p>Except ye believe that I am, ye shall die in your sins (<a href="3927/john_8_24.htm">John 8:24</a>). <p>Therefore David says: <p>I will declare the decree Jehovah said unto Me, Thou art My Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and ye perish in the way. Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him (<a href="3927/psalms_2_7.htm">Psalms 2:7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_2_12.htm">12</a>). <p>That in the consummation of the age, which is the last time of the church, there will be no faith, because there will be no faith in the Lord as the Son of God, the God of heaven and earth, and one with the Father, the Lord foretells in thee Gospels, saying, <p>That there shall then be an abomination of desolation, and tribulation such as hath not been nor ever shall be, and that the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven (<a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, 2<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">24:21</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">29</a>). <p>And in the Apocalypse, <p>That Satan, loosed out of his prison, shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, the number of whom is as the sand of the sea (<a href="3927/revelation_20_7.htm">20:7, 8</a>). <p>And because the Lord foresaw this, He also said: <p>Howbeit, when the Son of man cometh shall He find faith on the earth?

Hoc sequitur ut Conclusum ex omnibus quae praecedunt; ostensum enim est, quod Fides, quae vera et unica, sit in Dominum et a Domino, et quod Fides, quae non est in Ipsum et ab Ipso, non sit Fides spiritualis, sed naturalis, et fides mere naturalis non essentiam fidei in se habet.

Jesus dixit, cum venerit Spiritus veritatis, arguet Mundum de peccato, quod non credunt <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
in Me, <a href="3927/john_16_8.htm">Johannes 16:8-9</a>: et ad Judaeos, Nisi credideritis quod Ego sim, moriemini in peccatis vestris, <a href="3927/john_8_24.htm">Johannes 8:24</a>. Quare dicit David, Annuntiabo de statuto, Jehovah dixit, Filius meus Tu, Ego hodie genui Te: osculamini Filium, ne irascatur et pereatis in via; beati omnes confidentes in Ipso, <a href="3927/psalms_2_7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_2_12.htm">12</a>. Quod nulla fides, quia nulla in Dominum, ut Filium Dei, Deum Coeli et Terrae, ac unum cum Patre, in Consummatione <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
saeculi, quae est ultimum tempus Ecclesiae, futura sit, praedicit Dominus apud Evangelistas, dicendo, Quod futura sit abominatio desolationis, et quod afflictio, qualis non fuit, nec futura est: et quod Sol obscurabitur, et Luna non dabit lumen suum, et Stellae cadent de Coelo, <a href="3927/matthew_24_15.htm">Matthaeus 24:15</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">29</a>; et in Apocalypsi, Quod Satanas solutus e custodia sua, exibit ad seducendum gentes, quae in quatuor angulis Terrae, quarum numerus sicut arena maris, Cap. <a href="3927/revelation_20_7.htm">20:7-8</a>. <sup "fn120_5">5</sup>
