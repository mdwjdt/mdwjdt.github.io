<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>260</b>.另外，必须知道的是，字义是一种保护，以防止隐藏其中的纯正真理受到损害。它之所以起到保护作用，是因为字义能被扭向各个方向，照着对它的理解来解释，而它的内在则不会受到损害或侵犯。但是，人若引入与神圣真理相对立的虚假，就会造成损害，并且只有那些确信虚假观念的人才会做出这种事。这就是向圣言施暴的方式。字义则能起到保护作用，防止这种情况发生。那些出于自己的宗教信仰而具有虚假观念的人就出现这种问题，而那些没有确信这些虚假的人则不会。圣言的字义起保护作用就是圣言中基路伯所表示的，并且在圣言中以它们来描述。亚当及其妻子被逐出伊甸园后，安设在伊甸园入口的基路伯就表示这种保护。对此，我们读到以下经文：<br />耶和华神把他赶出去了，又在伊甸园东边安设基路伯，还有剑的火焰四面转动，要把守生命树的道路。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.23.htm">创世记3:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.24.htm">24</a>）<br />没有人明白这段经文是什么意思，除非他知道“基路伯”、“伊甸园”、“生命树”和“剑的火焰四面转动”分别表示什么。这些细节在出版于伦敦的《天堂的奥秘》一书论述本章的章节里已经予以解释。其中：“基路伯”表示保护；“生命树的道路”表示通向主的入口，人通过圣言属灵之义的真理获得这入口；“剑的火焰四面转动”表示最外围的神圣真理，诸如字义上的圣言，字义能被扭向各个方向。安在施恩座两头、圣所的约柜之上的金基路伯的意义也一样（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.18.htm">出埃及记25:18</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.21.htm">21</a>），“约柜”表示圣言，因为它里面的十诫是圣言的原型。“基路伯”表示保护。因此，主在基路伯之间与摩西说话（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.22.htm">出埃及记25:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出37.9.htm">37:9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.89.htm">民数记7:89</a>）；祂以属世之义来说话，因为主只在完全中与人说话，而字义中的神圣真理就在它的完全中（参看214－224节）。绣在会幕帘子和幔子上的基路伯也并非表示别的（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.1.htm">出埃及记26:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.31.htm">31</a>），因为会幕的帘子和幔子表示天堂和教会、因而圣言的最外层（参看220节）。刻在耶路撒冷圣殿的墙和门上的基路伯（<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.29.htm">列王纪上6:29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.32.htm">32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.35.htm">35</a>，参看221节），以及新殿内的基路伯（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.18.htm">以西结书41:18</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.20.htm">20</a>）所表相同。<br />因为“基路伯”表示保护，以防止直接靠近诸如内在地存在于圣言中的主、天堂和神圣真理，而是通过最外层间接靠近。这就是为何经上论到推罗王说：<br />你在你的测量之地封印，满有智慧，全然美丽。你曾在伊甸神的园中，佩戴各样宝石。你，基路伯，就是那护卫者的伸展；护卫的基路伯啊，我已在火石当中将你除灭。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.12.htm">以西结书28:12</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“推罗”表真理和良善的知识方面的教会，因此“推罗王”表圣言，圣言就是这些知识的所在和源头。显然，在这段经文中，“推罗王”表圣言的最外层，“基路伯”表保护，因为经上说：“你在你的测量之地封印，满有智慧，全然美丽。你曾在伊甸神的园中，佩戴各样宝石。你，基路伯，就是那护卫者的伸展”，以及“护卫的基路伯”。此处提到的宝石表属于字义的事物（参看217和218节）。因为基路伯表圣言的最外层及其保护，所以在大卫的诗篇中，经上说：<br />耶和华使天下垂，亲自降临，骑着基路伯。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.9.htm">诗篇18:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.10.htm">10</a>）<br />坐在基路伯上的以色列牧者啊，求你发出光来。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗80.1.htm">诗篇80:1</a>）<br />坐在基路伯上的耶和华。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗99.1.htm">诗篇99:1</a>）<br />骑着基路伯或坐在基路伯上表圣言最外在的意义。圣言中的神圣真理及其性质以也被称为基路伯的四活物来描述（以西结书1，9，10章），还以宝座中和宝座周围的四活物（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.6等.htm">启示录4:6等</a>）来描述（参看我出版于阿姆斯特丹的《破解启示录》239，275，314节）。</p>

<p>
260. 必須進一步明白, 文字意義是隱藏其中之純正真理的護衛, 使純正真理免受損害。之所以能保護, 是因為文字意義可被掰向各個方向, 可按各自對其理解來解釋, 卻不會對其內在意義造成損傷或侵害。一個人這樣,另一人那樣來理解聖言的文字意義, 並不會產生傷害。只有與聖理相反的偽謬產生時, 那些進一步確證這些偽謬時, 傷害才會產生。對聖言的侵犯就是以這種方式產生的, 這就是文字意義所保護的。這樣的保護還針對那些處於自身宗教的偽謬之中,但並未去進一步確證這些偽謬的人。
<p>聖言的文字意義作為一名護衛, 在聖言中用"基路伯"來表示在。在那裡就是如此描述, 當亞當和他的妻子被逐出伊甸園後, 用基路伯來表示的護衛被安置在通過伊甸園的入口。關於這點, 我們讀到:耶和華上帝把那人趕逐出去, 又在伊甸園東邊安設基路伯拿著四面轉動發火焰的劍, 來把守生命樹的路(<a href="3927/genesis_3_23.htm">創世記3:23-24</a>)。
<p>[2]除非知道"基路伯","伊甸園","生命樹"和"四面轉動發火焰的劍"所指何意, 無人能明白到底在講什麼。關於這些細節, 在『屬天的奧秘』(發表於倫敦)一書關於這章中有詳述:"基路伯"表示保護; "生命樹的路"表示通向主的入口, 人藉著聖言屬靈意義的真理來獲得; "四面轉動發火焰的劍"表示在最外在事物中的神性真理, 正如在文字意義中的聖言, 這層意義可向各方轉動。這層意思還用安在施恩座兩頭,聖所的約櫃之上的基路伯來表示(<a href="3927/exodus_25_18.htm">出埃及記25:18-21</a>)。"約櫃"表示聖言, 因為裡面的十誡是聖言的原型。"基路伯"表示保護, 因此主在基路伯之間與摩西說話(<a href="3927/exodus_25_22.htm">出埃及記25:22</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_37_9.htm">37:9</a>;<a href="3927/numbers_7_89.htm">民數記7:89</a>)。祂以屬世的意義來說話, 因為除非完全,主不與人說話, 而神性真理在(屬世的)文字意義中就是在完全之中(在之前<a href="214.htm">214-224</a>節有論述)。繡在會幕簾子和幔子上的基路伯也沒有別的表示(<a href="3927/exodus_26_1.htm">出埃及記26:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">31</a>), 因為會幕的簾子和幔子表示天國和教會的最外在事物, 因而是聖言的最外在事物(如第<a href="220.htm">220</a>節所述)。刻在耶路撒冷聖殿的牆和門的基路伯(<a href="3927/1-kings_6_29.htm">列王記上6:29</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_32.htm">32</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_35.htm">35</a>)(有見第<a href="221.htm">221</a>節), 以及新聖殿內的基路伯(<a href="3927/ezekiel_41_18.htm">以西結書41:18-20</a>)也是此意。
<p>[3]因為"基路伯"表示保護, 用以防止主,天國和聖理被直接接觸, 而只能通過最外在部分間接接觸。
<p>這就是為何說到推羅王:你, 在你的測量之地封上印, 智慧充足, 全然美麗。你曾在伊甸的園中。各樣寶石是你的遮掩。你, 基路伯, 是遮掩的廣闊區域。遮掩的基路伯啊, 我已在火的寶石中將你除滅"(<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">以西結書28:12-14</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_16.htm">16</a>)。
<p>"推羅"表示教會——關於真理和良善的知識方面, 因此"推羅王"表示聖言——就是這些知識的所在和源頭。很明顯, 這段經文所說的"推羅王"表示聖言的最外層。"基路伯"表示保護, 因為這樣說:"你, 在你的測量之地封上印, 智慧充足, 全然美麗。你曾在伊甸的園中。各樣寶石是你的遮掩。你, 基路伯, 是遮掩的廣闊區域"。除此以外, "遮掩的基路伯"也是此意。在此所說的寶石表示文字意義的內容(請見<a href="217.htm">217</a>和<a href="218.htm">218</a>節)。
<p>因為基路伯表示聖言的最外層及其保護, 所以在大衛的『詩篇』中說:耶和華使天下垂, 親自降臨, 並駕乘基路伯(<a href="3927/psalms_18_9.htm">詩篇18:9-10</a>)。坐在基路伯上的以色列的牧者, 發出光來(<a href="3927/psalms_80_1.htm">詩篇80:1</a>)。耶和華坐在基路伯上(<a href="3927/psalms_99_1.htm">詩篇99:1</a>)。
<p>駕乘基路伯或坐在基路伯上表示聖言最外在的意思。在『以西結書』第一,第九和第十章中, 用來描述聖言中的聖理及其屬性的四活物也被稱為基路伯;<a href="3927/revelation_4_6.htm">啟示錄4:6</a>及以後所述的寶座當中和寶座邊上的四活物也是此意(請見<a href="../ar/239.htm">破解啟示錄239</a>, <a href="../ar/275.htm">275</a>, <a href="../ar/3.htm">3-14</a>, 本人發表於阿姆斯特丹)。 </p>

260. It is important to know as well that the literal meaning is a protection to prevent harm to the genuine truths that lie inside it. The nature of this protection is that the literal meaning can be turned this way and that and explained to different levels of comprehension without damaging or violating what is inside. It does no harm if one person takes the literal meaning one way and another takes it another way. It is harmful, however, if people bring in false ideas that go against divine truths. Only people who are adamant about falsities do this. Doing so does violence to the Word. The literal meaning offers protection to prevent this from happening. It also offers protection to people who have been given false ideas by their religion but have not become adamant about them.
<p>The angel guardians in the Word both stand for and portray the protecting role of the Word's literal meaning. This protection is the meaning of the angel guardians who were placed at the entrance of the garden of Eden after Adam was thrown out with his wife. About this we read,
<p>When Jehovah God expelled the human, he made angel guardians dwell on the east side of the garden of Eden and made the flame of a sword turning this way and that to guard the pathway to the tree of life. (<a href="3927/genesis_3_23.htm">Genesis 3:23-24</a>)
</p>
<p>
[2] No one could see what these details mean without knowing the meaning of "angel guardians," "the garden of Eden," the garden's "tree of life," and "the flame of a sword" turning this way and that. These details have been explained in the relevant chapter of Secrets of Heaven, published in London [<a href="swedenborg_arcana-coelestia-elliott_305.htm">Secrets of Heaven 305-313</a>]. To be specific, the "angel guardians" mean protection. The "pathway to the tree of life" means the access to the Lord available to people through the truths in the Word's spiritual meaning. The "flame of a sword turning" means divine truth on the outermost level, which is like the Word in its literal meaning; it is similarly capable of being turned this way and that.
<p>The same thing is meant by the angel guardians made of gold that were placed on the two ends of the mercy seat that was on top of the ark in the tabernacle (<a href="3927/exodus_25_18.htm">Exodus 25:18-21</a>). The "ark" meant the Word because the Ten Commandments are the most basic thing in the Word. The "angel guardians" meant protection, which is why the Lord spoke with Moses from between the angel guardians (<a href="3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_37_9.htm">37:9</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_7_89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>). Further, the Lord spoke to Moses in the earthly meaning because he does not speak with us unless he speaks in a complete way, and divine truth has its complete form in the literal meaning (see 214-224 above).
<p>The angel guardians on the curtains and the veil in the tabernacle (<a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>) had a similar meaning. The curtains and the veil in the tabernacle meant the outermost aspects of heaven and the church; therefore they meant the outermost aspects of the Word as well (see 220 above).
<p>The same applies to the angel guardians carved on the walls and doors of the Temple in Jerusalem (<a href="3927/1-kings_6_29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_32.htm">32</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_35.htm">35</a>); see 221 above. Likewise, the angel guardians in the new temple (<a href="3927/ezekiel_41_18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18-20</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] Angel guardians mean the protection that prevents people from going directly to the Lord, heaven, and the divine truth in the form it takes inside the Word, and steers them instead to go indirectly through the [Word's] outermost level. For this reason we read the following statements about the king of Tyre:
<p>You who seal up your measurement; full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, you were in the Garden of Eden. Every precious stone was your covering. You, O angel guardian, were the stretching out of a covering. I lost you, O protecting angel guardian, in the midst of the stones of fire. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-14</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_16.htm">16</a>)
<p>"Tyre" means the church's knowledge of goodness and truth. "The king of Tyre" means the Word where that knowledge exists and originates. The king clearly means the Word on its outermost level and the angel guardian means protection, because it says, "You who seal up your measurement, every precious stone is your covering, you, O angel guardian, were the stretching out of a covering," and "O protecting angel guardian. " On the precious stones listed in that passage as referring to aspects of the literal meaning, see 217, 218 above. Since "angel guardians" mean the Word at the outermost level and protection as well, therefore we read the following phrases in David:
<p>Jehovah bowed down the heavens and came down. He rode upon an angel guardian. (<a href="3927/psalms_18_9.htm">Psalms 18:9-10</a>)
<p>Shine forth, O Shepherd of Israel who sits upon angel guardians. (<a href="3927/psalms_80_1.htm">Psalms 80:1</a>)
<p>Jehovah sitting upon angel guardians. (<a href="3927/psalms_99_1.htm">Psalms 99:1</a>)
<p>Riding and sitting "upon angel guardians" refers to the Word's outermost meaning.
<p>The Word's divine truth and the qualities of that truth are portrayed by four creatures that are also called angel guardians (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_9.htm">Ezekiel 1:9-10</a>), and by four creatures in the middle of the throne and next to it (<a href="3927/revelation_4_6.htm">Revelation 4:6-7</a>). See Revelation Unveiled (which I published in Amsterdam) 239, 275, 314. </p>

<p>
260. It should furthermore be known that the literal sense is a protection to prevent the genuine truths hidden within being harmed. It acts as a protection because that sense can be twisted in different directions and explained as it is understood, without its internal being harmed or violated. For it does no harm for the literal sense to be understood differently by different people; but harm is done, if a person introduces falsities which are in opposition to the Divine truths, and this is only done by those who have convinced themselves of false ideas. This is what does violence to the Word. The literal sense acts as a protection to prevent this happening, and this occurs with those whose religion has given them false ideas, but who have not convinced themselves of these falsities. The literal sense of the Word acting as a protection is what is meant by cherubim in the Word, and it is there described by them. This protection is meant by the cherubim which were placed at the entrance to the garden of Eden after Adam and his wife were expelled from it. We read of these:<p>When Jehovah God had cast out the man, He made cherubim to dwell on the east of the garden of Eden, and the flame of a sword turning this way and that, to guard the way to the tree of life, <a href="3927/genesis_3_23.htm">Genesis 3:23-24</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] No one can know what this means, unless he knows the meaning of cherubim, of the garden of Eden and the tree of life in it; and also of the flame of a sword turning this way and that. These details have been explained in the section dealing with this chapter in ARCANA CAELESTIA, published in London. This shows that cherubim mean protection, the way to the tree of life means the approach to the Lord, which people make by means of the truths of the spiritual sense of the Word; the flame of a sword turning means Divine truth at the outermost level, which resembles the Word in its literal sense, in being capable of being twisted like this. The meaning of the cherubim made of gold placed on the two ends of the mercy-seat, which was above the ark in the tabernacle (<a href="3927/exodus_25_18.htm">Exodus 25:18-21</a>), is similar. The ark meant the Word, because the Ten Commandments contained in it were the rudiments of the Word; the cherubim there meant protection, which is why the Lord spoke with Moses from between them (<a href="3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_37_9.htm">37:9</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_7_89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>). He spoke in the natural sense, for He does not speak with man except in fulness, and in the literal sense Divine truth is in its fulness (<a href="214.htm">214-224</a> above). Nor was anything else meant by the cherubim on the hangings of the tabernacle and on the veil (<a href="3927/exodus_26_1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">31</a>). For the hangings and veils of the tabernacle meant the outermost of heaven and the church, and so also of the Word (<a href="220.htm">220</a> above). Likewise the cherubim carved on the walls and the doors of the temple at Jerusalem (<a href="3927/1-kings_6_29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_32.htm">32</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_35.htm">35</a>; <a href="221.htm">221</a> above); and equally the cherubim in the new temple (<a href="3927/ezekiel_41_18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18-20</a>).</p>
<p>
[3] Since cherubim meant protection to prevent the Lord, heaven and Divine truth as it is inwardly in the Word, being directly approached, but only indirectly through the outermost, this is why it is said of the king of Tyre:<p>You who set the seal on your measured space, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, you were in Eden the garden. Every kind of precious stone was your covering. You, cherub, were the expanse of the covering. I have destroyed you, cherub who cover, in the midst of the stones of fire, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-14</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_16.htm">16</a>.<p>Tyre means the church as regards its knowledge of truth and good, and so the king of Tyre means the Word, which is the place and source of that knowledge. It is obvious that in this passage the king means the Word at the outermost level, and cherub means protection, for it says 'You who set the seal on your measured space; every kind of precious stone was your covering; you, cherub, were the expanse of the covering' as well as 'cherub who cover'. The precious stones which are also named there mean the contents of the literal sense (<a href="217.htm">217-218</a> above).<p>Because cherubim mean the Word at the outermost level and also its protection, it is said in the Psalms of David:<p>Jehovah tilted the heavens and came down, and rode upon a cherub, <a href="3927/psalms_18_9.htm">Psalms 18:9-10</a>.<p>Shepherd of Israel, who sits upon the cherubim, shine forth, <a href="3927/psalms_80_1.htm">Psalms 80:1</a>. Jehovah that sits upon the cherubim, <a href="3927/psalms_99_1.htm">Psalms 99:1</a>.<p>Riding on the cherubim or sitting on them means the outermost sense of the Word. The Divine truth in the Word and its nature are described by the four creatures, which are also called cherubim (in Ezekiel, chapters 1, 9-10); and also by the four creatures in the midst of the throne and beside the throne (<a href="3927/revelation_4_6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>ff). (See Apocalypse Revealed published by me at Amsterdam, 239, 275, 3-14.) </p>

260. It must be understood, moreover, that the sense of the letter is a guard for the genuine truths concealed within it, that they may not be injured. It is a guard in this way, that it may be turned hither and thither, and explained according to each one's understanding of it, and yet without injury or violence to its internal. For no harm is done when one person understands the sense of the letter in one way, and another in another way; but the harm is done when falsities are brought in which are contrary to Divine truths, and this is done only by those who have confirmed themselves in falsities. In this way violence is done to the Word. This is what the sense of the letter guards against, and it does this for those who are in falsities from their religion, but do not confirm these falsities. The sense of the letter of the Word as such a guard is signified in the Word by "cherubs," and is there described in this way. This guard is signified by the cherubs that were placed at the entrance to the garden of Eden, after Adam and his wife had been expelled from it, about which we read as follows: <p>When Jehovah God had driven man out He made cherubs to dwell at the east of the garden of Eden and the flame of a sword turning every way to keep the way of the tree of life (<a href="3927/genesis_3_23.htm">Genesis 3:23, 24</a>).
</p>
<p>
[2] No one can see what this means, unless he knows what is signified by "cherubs" and by "the garden of Eden," and by "the tree of life" there, and finally by "the flame of a sword turning every way." These particulars are explained in the exposition of this chapter in the Arcana Coelestia, published at London, namely, that "cherubs" signify a guard; "the way of the tree of life" signifies entrance to the Lord, which man obtains through the truths of the spiritual sense of the Word; "the flame of a sword turning every way" signifies Divine truth in outmost things, like the Word in the sense of the letter, which sense may be so turned. The same is meant by, <p>The cherubs of gold placed at the two ends of the mercy-seat, which was over the ark in the tabernacle (<a href="3927/exodus_25_18.htm">Exodus 25:18-21</a>), <p>"the ark" signifying the Word, because the Decalogue, which it contained, was the primitive of the Word, and the "cherubs" signifying a guard. Therefore between the cherubs the Lord spoke with Moses (<a href="3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_37_9.htm">37:9</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_7_89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>); and he spoke in the natural sense, since the Lord does not speak with man except in fullness, and Divine truth is in its fullness in the sense of the letter (as may be seen above, n. <a href="214.htm">214-224</a>). Nor is anything else signified, <p>By the cherubs upon the curtains and the veil of the tabernacle (<a href="3927/exodus_26_1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">31</a>); <p>for the curtains and veils of the tabernacle signified the outmost things of heaven and the church, and thus of the Word (as may be seen above,<a href="220.htm">220</a>). So again, by the cherubs carved on the walls and doors of the temple at Jerusalem (<a href="3927/1-kings_6_29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_32.htm">32</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_35.htm">35</a>) (see above n. <a href="221.htm">221</a>). <p>By the cherubs in the new temple (<a href="3927/ezekiel_41_18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18-20</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] Because "cherubs" signify a guard, that the Lord, heaven, and Divine truth such as it is interiorly in the Word, be not approached immediately, but mediately through outmosts, it is said of the king of Tyre: <p>Thou sealest up thy measure, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty; thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering. Thou cherub, the spreading out of one that protects; I have destroyed thee, O protecting cherub, in the midst of the stones of fire (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-14</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_16.htm">28:16</a>). <p>"Tyre" signifies the church as to knowledges of good and truth and therefore "the king of Tyre" signifies the Word, in which and from which those knowledges are; and here the Word in its outmost is evidently signified, and protection by "the cherub," for it is said, "Thou sealest up thy measure," "every precious stone was thy covering," "thou cherub, the spreading out of one that protects," also, "O protecting cherub." The "precious stones" there mentioned mean the things belonging to the sense of the letter (as may be seen above, n. <a href="217.htm">217, 218</a>). Because "cherubs" signify the Word in outmosts, and also a guard, it is said in David: <p>Jehovah bowed the heavens and came down, and rode upon a cherub (<a href="3927/psalms_18_9.htm">Psalm 18:9, 10</a>). <p>O Shepherd of Israel, thou that sittest upon the cherubs, shine forth (<a href="3927/psalms_80_1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>). <p>Jehovah sitteth upon the cherubs (<a href="3927/psalms_99_1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>). <p>"To ride upon cherubs" and "to sit upon them" means upon the outmost sense of the Word. Divine truth in the Word, and what it is, is described by the four animals that were also called cherubs (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a> ,<a href="3927/ezekiel_9_1.htm">9:1</a> ,<a href="3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10:1</a> also by the four animals in the midst of the throne and round about the throne (<a href="3927/revelation_4_6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>). (See Apocalypse Revealed, published by me at Amsterdam, n. <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_239.htm">239</a>, <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_275.htm">275</a>, <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_314.htm">314</a>). </p>

260. Moreover it should be known that the sense of the Letter is a guard for the genuine truths lying within it, lest they should suffer injury. It is a guard in this respect that it may be turned this way and that, and interpreted according to one's own apprehension, without its interior content being injured or violated. It does no harm that the sense of the Letter is understood differently by different persons; but harm results when falsities are introduced which are contrary to Divine truths. This, however, only happens in the case of those who have confirmed themselves in falsities. In this way violence is inflicted on the Word; and to prevent this, the sense of the Letter acts as a guard with those who are in falsities from their religion, but who do not confirm its falsities. The sense of the Letter of the Word as a guard is signified and also described in the Word by cherubim. This guard is signified by the cherubim which, after the expulsion of Adam and his wife from the Garden of Eden, were placed at the entrance. Of these it is written, when JEHOVAH God drove out the man,<p>"He placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life" <a href="3927/genesis_3_23.htm">Genesis 3:23-24</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] No one can know what these words signify unless he knows the signification of cherubim, the garden of Eden, the tree of life therein, and also the flaming sword which turned every way. These particulars are explained under this chapter in the work, "Arcana Caelestia," published in London, as follows: cherubim signify a guard; the way of the tree of life signifies access to the Lord, which men obtain by means of the truths of the spiritual sense of the Word; and the flaming sword turning every way signifies Divine Truth in ultimates which, like the Word in the sense of the Letter, can be so turned. The same is meant by the cherubim of gold placed over the extremities of the mercy-seat which was above the ark in the tabernacle, <a href="3927/exodus_25_18.htm">Exodus 25:18-21</a>. The Word was signified by the ark because the Decalogue was the foremost of its contents, and a guard was signified by the cherubim. On this account the Lord talked with Moses between the cherubim,<a href="3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_37_8.htm">37:8</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_7_89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>.<p>He spoke in the natural sense, for He never speaks with man except in fulness, and in the sense of the Letter Divine Truth is in its fulness, as may be seen above,<a href="214.htm">214-224</a>. The same is signified by the cherubim upon the curtains of the tabernacle and upon the veil; <a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>; for the curtains and the veils of the tabernacle signified the ultimates of heaven and the Church, and consequently of the Word,<a href="220.htm">220</a>; also by the cherubim carved on the walls and doors of the temple at Jerusalem, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_32.htm">32</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_35.htm">35</a>, as may be seen above,<a href="221.htm">221</a>; and also by the cherubim in the new temple, <a href="3927/ezekiel_41_18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18-20</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] Since cherubim signified a guard lest the Lord, heaven, and Divine Truth as it is interiorly within the Word, should be approached immediately instead of mediately through ultimates, therefore, it is said of the king of Tyre:<p>"Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was Thy covering... Thou, O cherub, art the spreading forth of the covering (A. V., art the anointed cherub that covereth)... I have destroyed (A.V., I will destroy) thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire" <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-14</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_16.htm">16</a>.<p>Tyre signifies the Church as to the knowledges of truth and good; and hence the king of Tyre signifies the Word, which is the source of that knowledge. It is evident that the king here signifies the Word in its ultimate, and the cherubim a guard, for it is said: "Thou sealest up the sum, every precious stone was thy covering; thou, O cherub, art the spreading forth of the covering," and "O covering cherub." By the precious stones also mentioned here are signified the contents of the sense of the Letter, as may be seen above, <a href="217.htm">217-218</a>.<p>Since by cherubim is signified the Word in ultimates, and also a guard, therefore it is said in David:<p>"JEHOVAH bowed the heavens also, and came down... and He rode upon a cherub" <a href="3927/psalms_18_9.htm">Psalms 18:9-10</a>.<p>"O Shepherd of Israel... Thou that dwellest between the cherubim, shine forth" <a href="3927/psalms_80_1.htm">Psalms 80:1</a>.<p>"JEHOVAH sitteth between the cherubim" <a href="3927/psalms_99_1.htm">Psalms 99:1</a>.<p>To ride upon the cherubim, and to sit upon them, means on the ultimate sense of the Word. Divine Truth in the Word and the nature of that Truth are described by the four animals, which are also called cherubim, in <a href="3927/ezekiel_1_1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a> <a href="3927/ezekiel_9_1.htm">9</a> and <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10</a>; and also by the four animals in the midst of the throne, and near the throne, <a href="3927/revelation_4_6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>; and following verses. See "Apocalypse Revealed," published by me at Amsterdam,<a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_239.htm">239</a>, <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_275.htm">275</a>, <a href="swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_314.htm">314</a>. </p>

Insuper sciendum est, quod Sensus literae sit custodia pro genuinis veris, quae intus latent, ne laedantur; et in eo est custodia, quod ille Sensus possit huc illuc verti, et explicari secundum captum, et tamen Internum ejus non laedi et violari; non enim nocet, quod Sensus literae aliter ab uno quam ab altero intelligatur, sed id nocet, si homo falsa infert, quae contra Divina vera sunt, quod unice fit ab illis, qui se in falsis confirmaverunt; per hoc infertur Verbo violentia: ne hoc fiat, custodit Sensus literae, et custodit apud illos, qui in falsis sunt ex Religione, et falsa ejus non confirmant. Sensus literae Verbi ut Custodia, significatur per Cherubos in Verbo, et quoque per illos describitur ibi. Haec Custodia significatur per Cherubos, qui, postquam Adamus cum Uxore ejectus est ex Horto Edenis, ad introitum ejus positi sunt, de quibus haec leguntur, Cum Jehovah Deus expulerat hominem, habitare fecit ab Oriente horti Edenis CHERUBOS, et flammam gladii hinc inde vertentis se, ad custodiendum viam Arboris vitae, <a href="3927/genesis_3_23.htm">Genesis 3:23-24</a>.</p>

Simile intelligitur per CHERUBOS EX AURO POSITOS super duabus extremitatibus Propitiatorii, quod erat super Arca, in Tabernaculo, <a href="3927/exodus_25_18.htm">Exodus 25:18-21</a>; per Arcam significabatur Verbum, quia Decalogus in illa erat primitivum ejus; per Cherubos ibi significabatur custodia, quare Dominus cum Mose inter illos loquutus est, <a href="3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_37_9.htm">37:9</a>; <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
