<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>45</b>.从对圣爱的描述可以看出它的对立面，即魔鬼之爱的本质。魔鬼之爱是我欲，它虽冠以爱之名，但就本身而言，其实是恨。因为它只爱自己，只愿为了利己而与他人结合，不愿为了利人而与他人结合。其至内在的性质就是不断试图统治每个人，夺取每个人的财物，最终象神明那样被崇拜。这就是为何地狱居民都不承认神，却视那些比其他人强大的人为神明。所以，他们根据其权力范围而拥有高低不等、大大小小的神明。在地狱，这就是每个人心之所系的，所以那里的每个人都燃烧着对自己神明的仇恨。而后者反过来对他所控制的人也以恨相待，视他们为卑贱的奴隶。只要他们敬拜他，他就会客气地与他们说话，但对其他人却怒火中烧，而且发自于内，或从心里向自己的追随者发怒。我欲与盗贼当中的爱一样。共同劫掠时，他们彼此拥抱亲吻，但得手后却迫切想杀害彼此，以占有所有脏物。<br />在地狱：凡这爱所统治的地方，它都使得其欲望从远处看似各种野兽，有的象狐狸和豹子，有的象狼和虎，有的象鳄鱼和毒蛇；它使得地狱居所充满乱石堆和沙砾，以及遍满呱鸣之蛙的沼泽，还使阴郁的鸟儿在他们的棚屋上盘旋和尖叫。这就是圣言先知书中所提到的旷野禽兽和豺狼，那里描述了出于我欲的统治欲（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.21.htm">以赛亚书13:21</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.39.htm">耶利米书50:39</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗74.14.htm">诗篇74:14</a>）。</p>

45. 從以上對聖仁本質的描寫中, 你也能明白(來自地獄的)魔愛的本質像什麼, 與聖仁對比之後就會更明顯。
<p>魔愛是一種唯獨利己的愛。這種愛其實是恨。它並不愛自己以外的任何人。不會為了祝福他人而與他們建立一種聯合的關係, 而只為了自己得祝福。更進一步, 它不斷地爭取去支配其他所有人,奪取他們的好處。
<p>最終, 它還想被崇拜為上帝。這就是為何地獄中的居民都不承認上帝。他們卻承認那些強過他們的人為神明。從地獄的角度來看, 那兒有低等和高等的神, 或者小神和大神, 按照各自的能力大小而等級不同。因為所有地獄居民的心中所含的都是對自己的愛, 對他們的神明, 其實心燃恨意。
<p>反過來, 這些神對所有在他們掌管之下的惡靈以恨相待, 視他們為可惡的奴隸。只要這些跟隨者保持恭敬, 他們就勉強柔和相對。對其他的, 他們徑直公開發怒。在內心之中, 他們一樣向他們的跟隨者發怒。
<p>只為自己,或僅僅利己的愛, 在盜賊之中可發現這樣的愛:當他們一起合作行竊時, 甚至可以相互擁抱, 但是到最後卻想殺掉同夥以奪取別人那份賊贓。
<p>在地獄, 只為自己的愛或我欲是占統治地位的力量。在一定距離之外觀看地獄居民和他們的我欲, 顯現為各樣的野獸。一些像狐狸和豹, 一些像豺狼和虎, 一些像鱷魚和毒蛇。這樣的我欲令他們所住之地成為亂石堆和沙礫的荒漠, 呱鳴之蛙亂竄的沼澤。在他們所住的破舊棚屋上空盤飛著各樣慘叫的禽鳥。這些野獸與禽鳥, 與聖言先知書中所說的鴞,荒漠野獸,豺狼等一樣,用來表達因我欲而萌生統治欲(<a href="3927/isaiah_13_21.htm">以賽亞書13:21</a>;<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_39.htm">耶利米書50:39</a>;<a href="3927/psalms_74_14.htm">詩篇74:14</a>)。 </p>

45. From this description of divine love's essence, you can also see what the essence of diabolical love is like; it becomes visible by contrast.
<p>Diabolical love is a love for oneself. This is called love, but seen in its own right it is really hatred. It does not love anyone outside itself. It does not want to form a partnership with others in order to bless them; it wants to bless only itself. From deep inside, it constantly strives to dominate all others and to own the good things they have.
<p>Eventually it wants to be adored as God. This is why those who are in hell do not acknowledge God. Instead they acknowledge as gods those who have power over others. From hell's point of view, then, there are lower and higher gods, or lesser and greater gods, according to the reach of each one's power. Because all who are in hell carry love for themselves in their heart, they burn with hatred against their "god. "
<p>The "gods" in turn burn with hatred against all who are under their thumb; they think of them as vile slaves. They manage to speak softly to them as long as their followers keep showing adoration. They openly rage against all others. Inwardly or at heart, they rage against their followers as well.
<p>Love for oneself is the same love you see among thieves, who kiss each other when they are on a job together, but later each burn with a desire to kill the others and take their share.
<p>In hell, love for oneself is the dominant force. It causes the people there and their selfish lusts to appear at a distance as various species of wild animal. Some people there look like foxes and leopards, some like wolves and tigers, some like crocodiles and venomous snakes. Their love for themselves also causes the deserts they live in to consist of mere piles of stones and bare gravel, with swamps here and there that contain croaking frogs. Over their huts fly miserable screeching birds. These animals and birds are the same as the owls, the wild beasts of the desert, and the jackals mentioned in the prophetical books of the Word in reference to the love of dominating that comes from love for oneself (<a href="3927/isaiah_13_21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_74_14.htm">Psalms 74:14</a>). </p>

45. The description of the essence of the Divine Love allows us also to see its opposite, the essence of devilish love. Devilish love is self-love, and it goes by the name of love, but regarded in itself is hatred, for it loves no one other than itself, and has no wish to be linked with others for their happiness, but only its own. Its inmost nature is a continual attempt to rule over everyone, to possess everyone's goods, and finally to be adored like a god. This is why the inhabitants of hell do not acknowledge God, but treat as gods those who are more powerful than others; so they have lower and higher, or minor and major deities, depending on the extent of their power. Because each person there has his heart set on that, he has a burning hatred of his own deity; and he in turn of those who are under his control. He looks upon them as worthless servants, to whom he talks politely so long as they worship him, but is fired with rage against the rest, and inwardly or in his heart against his own followers. Self-love is the same as love among thieves, who hug each other when they are engaged in robberies, but later on they ardently long to murder the others and steal their booty from them.</p>
<p>
[2] This love is the reason why its desires in hell, where it is sovereign, look at a distance like various kinds of wild beasts; some like foxes and leopards, some like wolves and tigers, some like crocodiles and poisonous snakes. The deserts where they live consist of nothing but piles of stones or bare gravel, interspersed with marshes full of croaking frogs. Mournful birds swoop over their huts wailing. These are the ochim, tziim and iyim mentioned in the prophetic books of the Word which describe the love of domination arising from self-love (<a href="3927/isaiah_13_21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_74_14.htm">Psalms 74:14</a>). </p>

45. From this description of the essence of the Divine love the essential nature of diabolical love can be seen. This can be seen as being an opposite. Diabolical love is the love of self. That is called love, although viewed in itself it is hatred; for it loves no one outside of itself; neither does it desire to be joined with others in order to benefit them, but only to benefit itself. From its inmost it continuously aspires to rule over all and to possess the goods of all, and finally to be worshiped as God. This is why those who are in hell do not acknowledge God, but acknowledge as gods those who surpass others in power; thus they acknowledge lower and higher, or lesser and greater gods, according to the extent of their power. And as this is what everyone there has at heart, everyone burns with hatred against his own god, and this latter against those who are under his sway, regarding them as vile slaves, to whom he speaks courteously so long as they worship him, but he rages as if with fire against all others, and also inwardly, or in his heart, against his own vassals. For the love of self is the same as that of robbers; who kiss each other so long as they are engaged in robberies, but afterwards burn with a desire to kill each other, in order to take all the plunder. In hell, where it rules, this love causes its lusts to appear at a distance like various kinds of wild beasts, some like foxes and leopards, some like wolves and tigers, and some like crocodiles and poisonous serpents; it causes the deserts, which are places of abode there, to consist of nothing but heaps of stones or bare gravel, with bogs interspersed in which frogs croak; and it causes doleful birds to fly and screech above their huts. Such are "the doleful creatures (ochim)," "the wild beasts of the desert (tziim)," and "the wild beasts of the islands (ijim)," mentioned in the prophetic parts of the Word, where the love of rule from self-love is treated of (<a href="3927/isaiah_13_21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_74_14.htm">Psalms 74:14</a>). </p>

45. From this description of the essence of Divine Love may be seen by contrast the nature of diabolical love. This is the love of self: it is called love, but viewed in itself it is hatred; for it does not love anyone outside of itself nor does it desire to unite with others so as to benefit them, but only to benefit itself. From its inmost nature it continually strives to rule over all, to possess the property of all, and finally to be worshiped as God. For this reason those who are in hell do not acknowledge God, but recognize as gods those who exercise power over others; thus they worship inferior and superior, or lesser and greater gods according to the extent of their power. Since everyone there bears this lust of dominion in his heart, he burns with hatred against his own deity, and this deity in turn against those who are under his rule; and he regards them as vile slaves, speaking courteously to them as long as they worship him, but raging furiously against all others, as he does indeed inwardly in his heart against his own votaries. For this love of self is like love among thieves, who exhibit the tenderest marks of mutual affection when engaged in their depredations, but who burn with a desire to kill their confederates and acquire their share of the plunder. In that region of hell where it reigns this love causes its lusts to appear from a distance like various kinds of wild beasts, some as foxes and leopards, some as wolves and tigers, and some as crocodiles and poisonous serpents. It also causes the deserts where they live to consist solely of heaps of stones or barren gravel, interspersed with bogs where frogs croak, while over their miserable hovels fly birds, dolefully screeching. These creatures are what are meant by the Ochim, Tziim, and Ijim, mentioned in the Prophetical Books of the Word where the subject is the love of dominion arising from the Love of self. <a href="3927/isaiah_13_21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_74_14.htm">Psalms 74:14</a>. </p>

45. Ex descriptione Essentiae Divini amoris, videri potest qualis est essentia amoris diabolici; hoc videri potest ex opposito; amor diabolicus est amor sui, et hic vocatur amor, sed in se spectatus est odium, non enim amat quempiam extra se, nec vult conjungi aliis ut benefaciat illis, sed modo ut sibi; ex intimo sui continue affectat imperare super omnes, et quoque possidere omnium bona, et demum ut adoretur sicut Deus: quae causa est, quod illi qui in Inferno sunt, non agnoscant Deum, sed pro diis illos, qui potestate super alios valent, ita inferiores et superiores, seu minores et majores deos secundum extensionem potestatis; et quia quisque ibi id corde gerit, flagrat etiam odio contra suum deum, et hic contra illos qui sub imperio ejus sunt, et reputat illos ut viles servos, cum quibus quidem blande loquitur, quamdiu adorant, sed furit sicut ex igne contra reliquos, et quoque interius seu in corde contra clientes;</p>
<p>
[2] est enim amor sui idem cum amore latronum, qui se mutuo osculantur, quando in latrociniis sunt, sed postea ardent cupidine occidendi illos, ut illorum praedas etiam latrocinentur. Hic amor in causa est, quod cupiditates ejus in Inferno, ubi regnat, e longinquo appareant sicut variae species ferarum, quaedam sicut vulpes et pardi, quaedam sicut lupi, et tigrides, et quaedam sicut crocodili et serpentes venenati: et quod deserta, ubi vivunt, non consistant nisi ex struibus lapidum, aut ex nuda glarea, intermixtis paludibus, in quibus crocitant ranae; et quod super mapalia illorum volent aves lugubres et ululent: ochim, tziim, et ijim, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
