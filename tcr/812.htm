812. 从灵界的英国人可以看出, 他们有两种神学体系, 一种基于其信的教义, 另一种基于其仁的教义。 被委任神职的人员持前一种, 平信徒则持后一种, 尤其是苏格兰和邻近地区的人。 唯信的信仰者害怕和平信徒发生争论, 因为这些人既通过引用圣言, 也通过运用理智对付他们。 教会在安息日读给领受圣餐者的劝诫, 明明白白阐述了仁爱的教义。 劝诫公开宣称, 如果他们没有仁爱, 也不避恶如罪, 就会将自己丢进永恒的诅咒; 如果在这种状态下领受圣餐, 魔鬼将进入他们里面, 如同进入犹大那样。 </p>

812. From the people from Britain in the spiritual world I have gathered that the British have two approaches to theology. One centers on their teachings regarding faith; the other centers on their teachings regarding goodwill. The people who are ordained into the priesthood embrace a theology of faith. Many of the laity, especially people who live in or near Scotland, embrace a theology of goodwill. Those in faith alone are afraid to tangle with these lay people, because the latter argue with them on the basis of both the Word and reason.
<p>The theology centered on goodwill is visible in the statement the British read out loud every Sunday before people come forward to take the Holy Supper. That statement plainly says that if people are not devoted to goodwill and do not abstain from evils on the grounds that they are sinful, they are hurling themselves into everlasting damnation. If they do not come forward to take the holy communion worthily, the Devil is going to enter into them as he entered into Judas. </p>

812. I perceived from those in the spiritual world who are from Britain that they have two systems of theology, one based upon their doctrine of faith, the other on their doctrine of charity. Those who base themselves on the doctrine of faith are those who are ordained into the priesthood; those who base themselves on the doctrine of charity are many of the laymen, especially those who live in Scotland and adjacent areas. The believers in faith alone are wary of starting arguments with these people, since they contend with them both by quoting the Word and by the use of reason. Their doctrine of charity is plainly to be seen in the exhortation read every Sunday in their churches to those attending the Sacrament of the Holy Supper. In this it is openly said that if they are not in charity and do not shun evils as sins, they are casting themselves into eternal damnation; and that otherwise, if they come to Holy Communion, the devil will enter into them as he did into Judas. </p>

812. From those in the spiritual world who were from England it was seen that they have two kinds of theology, one derived from their doctrine of faith, and the other from their doctrine of charity; the former is held by those who are initiated into the priesthood, and the latter by the laity, especially those who dwell in Scotland and on its borders. With these latter the believers in faith alone are afraid to engage in argument, because they combat them both from the Word and from reason. This doctrine of charity is set forth in the exhortation read in the churches on the Sabbath day to those who approach the sacrament of the holy supper. In that exhortation it is openly declared that if they are not in charity and do not shun evils as sins, they cast themselves into eternal damnation; and if in such a state they approach the holy communion, the devil will enter into them as he did into Judas. </p>

812. It has been observed, from the English in the spiritual world, that they have a twofold theology, one based on their doctrine of faith, and the other on the doctrine of charity. The former is held by those who are initiated into the priesthood, and the latter by many of the laity, especially by those who live in Scotland and on its borders. With these the believers in faith alone are afraid to engage in dispute, because they use in controversy the Word and reason. Their doctrine of charity is set forth in the exhortation read in the churches on the Sabbath day to those who attend the Sacrament of the Holy Supper. In this it is openly declared that if they are not in charity, and do not shun evils as sins, they cast themselves into eternal damnation; and that if they should come to the Holy Communion when not in charity, the devil would enter into them as he entered into Judas. </p>

812. Ex illis, qui ex Anglia in Mundo spirituali sunt, perceptum est, quod illis sit duplex Theologia, una ex Doctrina fidei illorum, et altera ex Doctrina Charitatis; ex Doctrina fidei illis, qui sacerdotio initiantur, et ex Doctrina Charitatis plures e Laicis, imprimis illi, qui in Scotia et in confiniis ejus commorantur; cum his Solifidiani timent movere lites, quoniam hi pugnant cum illis tam ex Verbo quam ex Ratione; Doctrina haec Charitatis exstat in Oratione quovis die Sabbathi praelecta in Templis coram illis qui Sacramentum Coenae obeunt, in qua aperte dicitur, quod si non in Charitate sunt, et mala ut peccata non fugiunt, se in damnationem aeternam conjiciant, et quod alioquin, si ad Sanctam Communionem accederent, Diabolus in illos intraturus esset sicut in Judam. </p>
