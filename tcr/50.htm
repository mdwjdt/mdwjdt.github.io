<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>50</b>. （1）全能、全知和全在是出于圣爱的圣智的属性。全能、全知和全在是出于圣爱的圣智的属性，而非藉着圣智的圣爱的属性。这个天上的奥秘迄今不为任何人的理解力所理解，因为至今没人知道爱的本质是什么，源于爱的智慧的本质是什么，更不知道一个如何流入另一个，也就是说，爱及其一切细节流入智慧并住在那里，如同国王住在自己的王国，或主人住在自己家里，并将一切司法审判交由智慧裁决。由于公义是爱的属性，公平（或判断）是智慧的属性，所以爱将一切管理交由自己的智慧。接下来这个奥秘会更加明朗，同时，上述内容可作为一个准则。神的全能、全知和全在通过祂的爱之智慧产生，这一事实就是以下经文所表示的。约翰福音：<br />太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。万物借着祂造的；凡被造的、没有一样不是借着祂造的。生命在祂里头，这生命就是人的光。世界也是借着祂造的；道成了肉身。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">约翰福音1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处“道”表神圣真理，或也可说，表神性智慧。为此，它还被称作“生命”和“光”，因为“生命”和“光”无非是智慧。</p>

50. (1)代表聖仁作工的聖智有全能,全知和全在。
<p>全能,全知和全在歸屬于(代表聖仁作工的)聖智, 並非歸屬於聖仁。這個天上的秘密從未被人認知領悟, 因為在此之前, 無人明白仁的本質是什麼,又或智的本質是什麼, 更不知道仁流入智。仁,連同所有屬於仁的, 流入到智慧中,並如同一國之王或一家之主在那裡居住下來。公義的實施其實是仁爱藉著智慧的公平去執行。由於公義涉及仁愛,公平涉及智慧, 這就意味著仁爱將它的執行交給它的夥伴——智慧。這個秘密接下來會更加明朗, 以上的陳述是首先陳述的一般規則。
<p>上帝的全能,全知和全在通過仁愛的智慧來表達, 『約翰福音』中這段話正是此意:太初有道, 道與上帝同在, 道就是上帝。萬物藉著祂造的; 凡被造的,沒有一樣不是藉著祂造的。生命在祂裡頭, 這生命就是人的光。世界也是藉著祂造的; 道成了肉身(<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">約翰福音1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3-4</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>)。在這段話裡, "道"意味著聖理(就是神性真理), 或相當於同樣的意思:聖智。這就是為何道也被稱為"生命"和"光", 因為生命和光不是別的, 就是聖智。 </p>

50. 1. It is divine wisdom, acting on behalf of divine love, that has omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence. Omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence belong to divine wisdom acting on behalf of divine love, not to divine love acting through divine wisdom. This is a secret from heaven that has never yet dawned on anyone's understanding, because before this no one has known what love is in its essence, or what wisdom is in its essence, much less how the one flows into the other. Love, with everything that belongs to it, flows into wisdom and takes up residence there like a monarch of a realm or a head of a household. The actual administration of justice is something love leaves to wisdom's judgment; and since justice relates to love and judgment to wisdom, this means that love leaves the administration of love to its [partner,] wisdom. More light will be shed on this secret in what follows. For now, the statement above will have to serve as a general rule.
<p>The following words in John mean that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent through the wisdom of his love:
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by it, and nothing that was made came about without it. In it there was life, and that life was the light for humankind. And the world was made by it; and the Word became flesh. (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3-4</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>)
<p>In this passage "the Word" means divine truth or, what amounts to the same thing, divine wisdom. This is why the Word is also called "life" and "light," since life and light are nothing but wisdom. </p>

50. (i) OMNIPOTENCE, OMNISCIENCE AND OMNIPRESENCE ARE PROPERTIES OF THE DIVINE WISDOM RESULTING FROM THE DIVINE LOVE.<p>That omnipotence, omniscience and omnipresence are qualities of the Divine Wisdom as the result of the Divine Love, and not of the Divine Love by means of the Divine Wisdom, is a secret from heaven which up to now has not dawned on anyone's understanding, because no one so far has known what love is in its essence and what the wisdom derived from it is in its, not to mention the influence of one upon the other. What happens is that love with all its particulars flows into wisdom and there lives like a king in his realm or a master in his house, leaving all the administration of justice to its judgment. Since righteousness is an attribute of love and judgment an attribute of wisdom, love leaves all control to its wisdom. The following pages will shed more light on this secret, for the moment this statement may serve as a rule. The fact that God's omnipotence, omniscience and omnipresence arise through the wisdom of His love is what is meant by the following passage from John:<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made through Him, and without Him was nothing made which was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men; and the world was made through Him; and the Word was made flesh, <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3-4</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>'Word' here means Divine Truth, or, what comes to the same thing, the Divine Wisdom. That is why it is also called life and light; for these are nothing but wisdom. </p>

50. (1) Omnipotence, Omniscience, and Omnipresence pertain to the Divine wisdom from the Divine love. That omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence, pertain to the Divine wisdom from the Divine love, but not to the Divine love through the Divine wisdom, is an arcanum from heaven that has not yet dawned upon the understanding of anyone, because it has not yet been known what love is in its essence, and what wisdom therefrom is in its essence, and still less how one flows into the other; namely, that love, with each and all things of love, flows into wisdom and dwells in it, as a king in his kingdom, or as a master in his house, leaving all the administration of justice to the judgment of wisdom; and as justice pertains to love, and judgment to wisdom, love leaves all the administration of love to its own wisdom. But this arcanum will borrow light from what follows; meanwhile let it serve as a canon. That god is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent through the wisdom of His love is meant by the words in John: <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the world was made by Him. And the Word was made flesh (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3-4, 1</a><a href="3927/john_1_10.htm">1:10</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>); <p>"the Word" here meaning the Divine truth, or, what amounts to the same thing, the Divine wisdom; and for this reason it is called "life" and "light," "life" and "light" being nothing else than wisdom. </p>

50. (1) OMNIPOTENCE, OMNISCIENCE, AND OMNIPRESENCE ARE ATTRIBUTES OF THE DIVINE WISDOM FROM THE DIVINE LOVE.<p>That omnipotence, omniscience and omnipresence are attributes of the Divine Wisdom from the Divine Love, but not of the Divine Love through the Divine Wisdom is an abstruse heavenly truth (arcanum) which has yet entered the mind of any one, because no one has hitherto known what love is in its essence, and what wisdom is in its essence, and still less concerning the influx of the one into the other. For love with all that pertains to it flows into wisdom and there abides, like a king in his kingdom, or a master in his house, leaving to its judgment the whole direction of justice, and since justice is an attribute of love, and judgment of wisdom, leaving to wisdom the whole authority of love. This truth will be made clear in what follows; in the meantime let it stand as a general principle. That God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent by means of the wisdom of His Love is meant by these words in John:<p>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men... The world was made by Him:... and the Word was made flesh" <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3-4</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>By the Word is there meant Divine Truth, or, what amounts to the same, Divine Wisdom. Therefore also it is called life and light, and life and light are nothing but wisdom. </p>

50. I. QUOD DIVINAE SAPIENTIAE EX DIVINO AMORE SIT OMNIPOTENTIA, OMNISCIENTIA, ET OMNIPRAESENTIA. Quod Divinae Sapientiae ex Divino amore sit Omnipotentia, Omniscientia et Omnipraesentia, non autem Divino Amori per Divinam Sapientiam, est Arcanum e Coelo, quod nondum in alicujus <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
intellectu illuxit, quia nullus adhuc scivit, quid Amor in sua essentia, et quid Sapientia inde in sua, et minus adhuc de influxu unius in alterum, qui est quod Amor cum omnibus et singulis sui influat in Sapientiam, et in hac resideat sicut Rex in suo Regno, aut sicut herus in <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
