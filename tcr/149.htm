<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>149</b>.（4）主把这些恩惠赐给那些信祂的人。主把差圣灵所表示的这些恩惠赐给那些信祂的人。也就是说，这些人靠着主得以改造、重生、更新、复活、成圣、称义、从恶中洁净，最终得救。这一点从前面（107节）所引用的圣言经文明显看出来，这些经文证明，那些信主的人拥有救恩和永生。另外，还有以下经文：<br />耶稣说，信我的人，就如经上所说，从他腹中要流出活水的江河来；耶稣这话是指着信祂之人要受圣灵说的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.38.htm">约翰福音7:38</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.39.htm">39</a>）<br />还有：<br />预言中的灵意乃是为耶稣作见证。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.10.htm">启示录19:10</a>）<br />“预言的灵意”表示取自圣言的教义真理。“预言”一直表示教义，“说预言”则表示教导教义；“为耶稣作见证”表承认信祂。在以下经文中，为祂作见证也有同样的含义：<br />米迦勒的使者因羔羊的血和自己所见证的道胜过那龙。那龙离开了，去与祂其余的种争战，就是那守神诫命，为耶稣作见证的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.11.htm">启示录12:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.17.htm">17</a>）</p>

<p>
149. (4)對那些信祂的, 主有這些強大的作用。
<p>主有這些強大作用是指通過"發送聖靈"給那些信祂的人。也就是說, 這些人是祂改造,更新,復興,啟動,成聖,稱義,潔淨,赦罪, 最終拯救的人。這可從聖言中所說的清楚得知, 所有這些經文都證明:拯救與永生給那些信主之人(見<a href="107.htm">107</a>節引述的經文)。下面經文表達同樣的觀點:耶穌說:"凡信我之人, 如經上所說的, 必有活水之江河, 從他腹中流出。"祂是指著聖靈說的, 就時信祂的人將要領受的(<a href="3927/john_7_38.htm">約翰福音7:38-39</a>)。還有這句:預言的靈(意)乃是為耶穌做見證。(<a href="3927/revelation_19_10.htm">啟示錄19:10</a>)"預言的靈(意)"表示從聖言教導的真理。預言一直表示教導的觀點, 去預言表示去教導這觀點。"耶穌的見證"表示承認信祂。在下列經文中, 耶穌的見證也有此意:米迦勒的使者們用羔羊的血和祂的見證之道勝了那龍。那龍走開去與祂餘下的種打仗, 就是遵守上帝誡命,為耶穌作見證的(<a href="3927/revelation_12_11.htm">啟示錄12:11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_17.htm">17</a>)。 </p>

149. 4. The Lord has these powerful effects on those who believe in him. The Lord has the powerful effects meant by the sending of the Holy Spirit on those who believe in him; that is, these are the people he reforms, regenerates, renews, brings to life, sanctifies, justifies, purifies from evils, and finally saves. This is clear from all the passages in the Word that establish that salvation and eternal life come to those who believe in the Lord (see the passages quoted in 107 above). The following passage makes the same point:
<p>Jesus said, "Any who believe in me - as Scripture says, rivers of living water will flow out of their bellies. " This he said of the Spirit that those who believe in him are going to receive. (<a href="3927/john_7_38.htm">John 7:38-39</a>)
<p>Also this passage:
<p>The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. (<a href="3927/revelation_19_10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>)
<p>The "spirit of prophecy" means a true doctrinal perspective from the Word. "Prophecy" has no other meaning except a doctrinal perspective. To prophesy means to teach that perspective. The testimony of Jesus means confessing faith in him. The testimony of Jesus also has this meaning in the following passage:
<p>Michael's angels' conquered the dragon using the blood of the Lamb and the Word of his testimony. The dragon went away to make war on the rest of his seed, who were keeping God's commandments and who have the testimony of Jesus Christ. (<a href="3927/revelation_12_11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_17.htm">17</a>) </p>

149. (iv) THE LORD CONFERS THESE BENEFITS ON THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN HIM.<p>The Lord confers these benefits, which are meant by the sending of the Holy Spirit, on those who believe in Him. That is to say, He reforms them, regenerates them, renews, quickens, justifies and cleanses them from evils, and so eventually saves them. This is proved by all the passages in the Word which attribute salvation and everlasting life to those who believe in the Lord, and which were quoted before (107). In addition there is this:<p>Jesus said, If anyone believes in me, as the Scripture says, streams of living water will flow from his belly; He said this about the spirit, which those who believe in Him are to receive, <a href="3927/john_7_38.htm">John 7:38-39</a>.<p>Also this:<p>The witness of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy, <a href="3927/revelation_19_10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>.<p>The spirit of prophecy means the truth of doctrine drawn from the Word. Prophecy always means doctrine, and to prophesy means to teach it; the witness of Jesus means confessing one's faith in Him. His witness has a similar meaning in this passage:<p>Michael's angels defeated the dragon by the blood of the Lamb, and the word of their <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
witness. And the dragon departed, to make war on the remainder of His seed, who kept the commandments of God, and bear witness to Jesus Christ, <a href="3927/revelation_12_11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_17.htm">17</a>.<p>

149. (4) The Lord makes these energies operative in those who believe in Him. That these energies, which are meant by the sending of the Holy Spirit, are made operative by the Lord in those who believe in Him, that is, that such are reformed, regenerated, renewed, vivified, sanctified, justified, purified from evils, and at length are saved by the Lord, is evident from all those passages in the Word quoted above (n. <a href="107.htm">107</a>) which prove that those who believe in the Lord have salvation and eternal life; also especially from this: <p>Jesus said, He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. But this spoke He of the Spirit which they that believed in Him were to receive (<a href="3927/john_7_38.htm">John 7:38, 39</a>). <p>And from this: <p>The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy (<a href="3927/revelation_19_10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>). "The spirit of prophecy" means truth of doctrine from the Word, "prophecy" signifying doctrine, while "to prophesy" signifies to teach doctrine; and "the testimony of Jesus" means confession from faith in Him. "His testimony" has a similar meaning in the following passage: <p>The angels of Michael overcame the dragon through the blood of the Lamb and through the word of their testimony. And the dragon went away to make war with the rest of her seed who kept the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ (<a href="3927/revelation_12_11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_17.htm">17</a>). </p>

149. (4) THE LORD OPERATES THESE VIRTUES IN THOSE WHO BELIEVE ON HIM.<p>The Lord renders effective these virtues, which are meant by the sending of the Holy Spirit, in those who believe on Him, that is, He reforms, regenerates, renews, quickens, sanctifies, justifies, purifies from evils, and finally saves them, as is evident from all those passages in the Word, quoted in <a href="107.htm">107</a>, which prove that they have salvation and eternal life who believe on the Lord. It is evident moreover from this passage: Jesus said,<p>"He that believeth on me as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. But this spake He of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive" <a href="3927/john_7_38.htm">John 7:38-39</a>;<p>and also from this:<p>"The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy" <a href="3927/revelation_19_10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>.<p>By the spirit of prophecy is meant the truth of doctrine derived from the Word; prophecy signifies nothing else but doctrine, and to prophesy signifies to teach doctrine; and by the testimony of Jesus is meant acknowledgment from faith in Him. The same is meant by testimony of Him when it is said:<p> the angels of Michael <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
overcame the dragon "by the blood of the Lamb, and by the Word of His (A.V. their) testimony... and the dragon went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ" <a href="3927/revelation_12_11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_17.htm">17</a>.<p>
