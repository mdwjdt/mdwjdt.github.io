668. The fact that baptism has been commanded is abundantly clear from John's baptizing in the river Jordan - all Judea and Jerusalem came there to be baptized (<a href="3927/matthew_3_5.htm">Matthew 3:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_4.htm">Mark 1:4-5</a>). Even the Lord our Savior himself was baptized by John (<a href="3927/matthew_3_13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>). The Lord also commanded his disciples to baptize all the nations (<a href="3927/matthew_28_19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).
<p>Surely everyone who is willing to can see that there was some divine purpose in the establishment of this practice - a purpose that has been hidden until now because the Word's spiritual meaning has not been revealed before. Today, however, this spiritual meaning is being revealed because the Christian church in its true essence is now getting underway for the first time. The former church was Christian not in essence or in reality but in name only. </p>

668. Baptism was commanded, as is plainly established by John's baptising in the Jordan, to which the whole of Judaea and Jerusalem came (<a href="3927/matthew_3_5.htm">Matthew 3:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_4.htm">Mark 1:4-5</a>). Again, the Lord our Saviour Himself was baptised by John (<a href="3927/matthew_3_13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>). Moreover, He commanded the disciples to baptise all nations (<a href="3927/matthew_28_19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). Can anyone fail to see, provided he wants to see, that there is something divine in that institution, something which has until now been hidden, because the spiritual sense of the Word has not before been revealed? This has been revealed at the present time, because the Christian church as it is in essence is now for the first time beginning. The previous church was merely Christian in name, not in fact and in essence. </p>

668. That baptism was commanded is made clearly evident by John's baptizing in Jordan, to which Jerusalem and all Judea went out (<a href="3927/matthew_3_5.htm">Matthew 3:5, 6</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_4.htm">Mark 1:4, 5</a>); also by this, that the Lord our Savior Himself was baptized by John (<a href="3927/matthew_3_13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>); and finally that He commanded His disciples to baptize all nations (<a href="3927/matthew_28_19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). Who that wishes to see it, does not see that there is something Divine in that institution, which has hitherto been concealed, because the spiritual sense of the Word has not before been revealed? And this sense is now revealed, because the Christian church, such as it is in itself, is just now in its very beginning. The former church was Christian in name only, not in fact and essence. </p>

That Baptism was commanded is clearly evident from John's baptizing in the Jordan, to which all Judea and Jerusalem went out, <a href="3927/matthew_3_5.htm">Matthew 3:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_4.htm">Mark 1:4-5</a>.

Any one may see, if he is willing to see, that in this institution there is something Divine, which has hitherto remained concealed, because so far the spiritual sense has not been made known. This has been revealed at this day, because the Christian Church, as it is in itself, is now just beginning. The former Church was Christian in name only, but not in reality and essence. </p>

668. Quod Baptismus mandatus sit, constat manifeste ex Baptismate Johannis in Jordane, ad quod universa Judaea et Hierosolyma accessit, <a href="3927/matthew_3_5.htm">Matthaeus 3:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_4.htm">Marcus 1:4-5</a>. Tum quod Ipse Dominus Salvator noster a Johanne baptizatus sit, <a href="3927/matthew_3_13.htm">Matthaeus 3:13-17</a>, et insuper quod mandaverit discipulis, ut baptizarent omnes Gentes, <a href="3927/matthew_28_19.htm">Matthaeus 28:19</a>. Quis non videt, qui vult videre, quod in illa Institutione sit Divinum quod hactenus latuit, quia Sensus spiritualis Verbi non prius revelatus est; et hic revelatus est hodie, quia Ecclesia Christiana, qualis in se est, nunc primum inchoat; prior Ecclesia modo nomine tenus fuit Christiana, sed non re et essentia. </p>
