832. There is a heaven for Muslims, just as there is a heaven for all peoples who acknowledge one God, who love what is just, and who do what is good as a religious practice. The Muslim heaven is separate from the Christian heaven.
<p>The Muslim heaven is actually divided into two heavens. In the lower of the two, Muslim men live honorable lives with multiple wives. The only Muslims, though, that are lifted up into the higher heaven are those who give up a plurality of wives and acknowledge our Lord and Savior and his authority over heaven and hell. I have been told that it is impossible for them to think that God the Father and our Lord are one, but they can believe that the Lord rules over the heavens and the hells because he is the Son of God the Father. This belief among them is what enables them to go up into the higher heaven. </p>

832. The Mohammedans, like all nations which acknowledge one God, love justice and do good for religious reasons, have their own heaven, but it lies outside the Christian one. The Mohammedan heaven, however, is divided into two. In the lower one they live decently with several wives. But the only ones to be raised from there into the upper heaven are those who put away their concubines and acknowledge the Lord our Saviour, together with His rule over heaven and hell. I have been told that they find it impossible to think of God the Father and our Lord as being one; but they can believe that He rules over the heavens and the hells, because He is the Son of God the Father. It is this belief of theirs which enables them to be granted by the Lord the privilege of rising into the higher heaven. </p>

832. The Mohammedans, like all nations who acknowledge one God, love justice and do good from religion, have their own heaven, but it is outside of the Christian heaven. The Mohammedan heaven, however, is divided into two. In the lower they live uprightly with several wives; but only those who give up their concubines and acknowledge the Lord our Savior, and also His dominion over heaven and hell, are raised up from this into their higher heaven. I have heard that it is impossible for them to conceive of God the Father and our Lord as one, but that it is possible for them to believe that the Lord rules over the heavens and the hells because He is the Son of God the Father. It is because of their holding this belief that it is granted them by the Lord to ascend into the higher heaven. </p>

832. The Mohammedans, like all nations who acknowledge one God, love justice and do good from a religious motive, have their own heaven; but it is outside the Christian heaven. The Mohammedan heaven is divided into two. Those in the lower heaven live honorably with several wives; but none of them are elevated into the higher heaven unless they give up their concubines and acknowledge the Lord our Savior, and at the same time His dominion over heaven and hell. I have heard that it is impossible for them to conceive that God the Father and our Lord are one; but that it is possible for them to believe that the Lord rules over the heavens and the hells, because He is the Son of God the Father. This faith is the means by which it is granted them by the Lord to ascend into the higher heaven. </p>

832. Est Mahumedanis, sicut omnibus Gentibus quae agnoscunt Deum unum, ac amant justum, et faciunt bonum ex Religione, suum Coelum, sed extra Christianum: ast Coelum Mahumedanum in duos est distinctum; in Inferiori vivunt honeste cum pluribus uxoribus, sed inde non alii in Coelum superius elevantur, quam qui abdicant pellices, et agnoscunt Dominum Salvatorem nostrum, et simul Ipsius Dominium super Coelum et Infernum. Audivi quod illis impossibile sit cogitare Deum Patrem et Dominum nostrum esse unum, sed quod illis possibile sit credere, quod dominetur super Coelos et Inferna, quia Filius Dei Patris est: haec Fides apud illos est, per quam ascensus in superius Coelum illis a Domino datur. </p>
