<h3 align="center" class="ired">真实的基督教 第309节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第五诫  不可杀人</h4><br />309. 就属世之义而言，“不可杀人”这条诫命表示不杀人，不对他造成致命伤害，不残害他的身体。它也表示不对人的名字或声誉做出任何极端伤害，因为对很多人来说，名声与生命同样宝贵。从更广泛的意义上讲，“杀人”包括意欲杀害的敌意、仇恨和报复的情感。杀意就隐含在它们里面，就像藏在木头灰烬下的余火。地狱之火正是这火，不是别的，因此才会有怒火中烧和复仇之火等说法。这些激情是意念层面的“杀人”，不是行为层面的“杀人”。倘若无须顾忌触犯法律、遭到反击或报复，这些激情就会爆发为行动，尤其是意念当中包含背叛或凶残的意味时。从主的话明显可知，这种仇恨就是谋杀：<br />你们听见有吩咐古人的话：“不可杀人”；又说“杀人者难免受审判。”只是我告诉你们，凡无理向弟兄动怒的，难免地狱之火。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.21.htm">马太福音5:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.22.htm">22</a>）<br />原因在于，意念中的一切其实是意愿的行动，因而就是行为。</p>

309. 第五誡 不可殺人
<p>"不可殺人"的屬世之義表示禁止殺人或使其受致命的傷害, 又或殘害他人的肢體。也表示不要對人的名字或聲譽做出任何極端的傷害, 因為對許多人而言, 名譽寶貴過他們的生命。
<p>更廣泛的意義, "殺"表示敵意,仇恨和報復, 其中都含有置人死地的欲望。潛藏在這些想法之中的殺意, 就像灰燼下仍在燃燒的木頭; 地獄之火正是如此。這就是為何人們常說怒火中燒和復仇之火等等。這些是意念層面上的"殺", 儘管未付諸行動。倘若無須顧忌觸犯法律,遭報應或者被報復, 這些意念就會爆發為行動, 特別是其中有欺詐與野蠻的成份時。
<p>主的話語足以證明仇恨就是殺的一種類型:你們聽見有吩咐古人的話:"不可殺人"; 又說"殺人者難免受審判。"只是我告訴你們, 凡無理向弟兄動怒的, 難免地獄之火(<a href="3927/matthew_5_21.htm">馬太福音5:21-22</a>)。
<p>原因在於, 我們內心的意志是我們想做的行為, 內心其實在做。 </p>

309. The Fifth Commandment
<p>You Are Not to Kill
<p>This commandment, "You are not to kill," in its earthly meaning means not killing people, inflicting on them any fatal wound, or mutilating their bodies. It also means not bringing any deadly evil against their names and reputations, since for many people their reputation and their life go hand in hand.
<p>In a broader earthly meaning, murdering includes hostility, hatred, and revenge, which involve longing for someone's death. Murder lies hidden inside these feelings like an area that is still burning inside a piece of wood under the ashes. Hellfire is nothing else. This is why we say someone blazes with hatred or burns for revenge. These feelings are murders at the level of intent even if not in act. If fear of the law, retribution, or revenge were taken away, these feelings would burst into action, especially if the intent involved deception or savagery.
<p>The following words of the Lord make it clear that hatred is murder:
<p>You have heard that it was said by ancient people, "You are not to kill; and whoever kills will be exposed to judgment. " But I say to you that any who are angry with their brother or sister for no good reason will be exposed to hellfire. (<a href="3927/matthew_5_21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>)
<p>The reason is that everything we intend is something we want and something we inwardly do. </p>

309. THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT<p>You are not to commit murder.<p>This commandment, 'You are not to commit murder', means in the natural sense that it is forbidden to kill a human being or inflict upon him any wound that might prove fatal; also to mutilate his body. It also means not doing any drastic injury to his name or reputation, since to many people their reputation is as precious as their life. In a wider natural sense murder includes feelings of enmity, hatred and revenge which are murderous in intent. For these have the idea of murder lurking in them, like fire in wood beneath ashes; and the fire of hell is precisely this. This is why we talk of burning with hatred and being hot for vengeance. These are murders in intention, but not in deed. If fear of the law, of retaliation and being punished in the same way were removed, such people would break out into actions, especially if the intention contains an element of deceit or savagery. These words of the Lord prove that hatred is a kind of murder:<p>You have heard that it was said by the men of old, You are not to commit murder, and anyone who kills will be subject to judgment. But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother unjustifiably will be subject <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
to the hell of fire, <a href="3927/matthew_5_21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>.<p>The reason is that everything intentional is an act of the will, and thus is essentially a deed.<p>

309. THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT. <p>THOU SHALT NOT KILL. <p>In the natural sense, this commandment "Thou shalt not kill" means not to kill a man, and not to inflict upon him any wound from which he may die, also not to maim his body. It means also not to inflict any deadly harm upon his name and fame, since with many fame and life go hand in hand. In a broader natural sense, murder means enmity, hatred, and revenge, which breathe slaughter; for in them murder lies concealed as fire in wood under ashes. Infernal fire is nothing else; hence the expressions, to be inflamed with hatred, to burn with revenge. These passions are murder in intention, not in act; but if fear of the law or of retaliation and revenge were removed from them, they would break forth into act, especially if there is treachery or ferocity in the intention. That hatred is murder, is evident from these words of the Lord: <p>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment. But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother rashly shall be in danger of the judgment. But whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council, and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire (<a href="3927/matthew_5_21.htm">Matthew 5:21, 22</a>). <p>This is because whatever pertains to the intention pertains also to the will, and so essentially to the deed. </p>

309. THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT<p>THOU SHALT NOT KILL.<p>This commandment, "Thou shalt not kill," in the natural sense not only forbids killing a man, and inflicting on him any wound which may cause his death, but also mutilating his body. It also forbids any deadly injury to his name and reputation, for many hold reputation and life itself in equal estimation. In a wider natural sense murder signifies deadly enmity, hatred and revenge, for murder lurks within these like fire in wood under ashes. Infernal fire is nothing else, and therefore we speak of being inflamed with hatred, and burning with revenge. These passions are murder in intention, though not in act; and if fear of the law of retaliation and revenge were taken away from them they would break forth into act, especially if the intention is linked with treachery or ferocity. That hatred is murder is evident from these words of the Lord,<p>"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of hell fire" <a href="3927/matthew_5_21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>.<p>This is because everything belonging to the intention belongs also to the will, and so belongs to the deed in its essential nature. </p>

309. QUINTUM PRAECEPTUM.<p>Non Occides.<p>Per hoc Praeceptum, Non occides; in Sensu Naturali intelligitur non Occidere hominem, et non aliquam plagam, ex qua mori potest, ei infligere, et quoque non mutilare ejus corpus; et insuper non aliquod malum internecinum ejus nomini et famae inferre, quoniam fama et vita apud plures pari passu vadunt. In Sensu latiori naturali per homicidia intelliguntur inimicitiae, odia, et vindictae, quae spirant necem; in illis enim latet homicidium, sicut ignis in ligno sub cinere; ignis infernalis nec aliud est; quare dicitur ardescere odio et flagrare vindicta. Haec sunt Homicidia in intentione, non autem actu, et si auferretur <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
illis timor pro lege, proque talione et vindicta, erumperent in actum, imprimis si intentioni inest dolus aut ferocitas. Quod odium sit homicidium, constat ex his Domini verbis, Audivistis, quod a veteribus dictum sit, non occides, et quisquis occiderit, obnoxius erit judicio: Ego vero dico vobis, quod quisquis irascitur fratri suo temere, obnoxius erit gehennae ignis, <a href="3927/matthew_5_21.htm">Matthaeus 5:21-22</a>. Causa est, quia omne quod est intentionis etiam est voluntatis, et sic in se facti.<p>
