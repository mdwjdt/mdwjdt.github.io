<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>430</b>.公众的仁爱义务主要是纳税，纳税的义务绝不可与公职的职责相混淆。属灵人对纳税的感受不同于纯属世人。属灵人怀着善愿缴税，因为所缴的税款被用来使国家运转、保卫国家和教会，并支付各级政府人员的经费，他们的薪水要从公共财政当中支出。因此，那些视自己的国家和教会为邻舍之人，心甘情愿地缴税，认为骗税、逃税是错误的。然而，那些不视自己的国家和教会为邻舍之人，缴税时则心不甘、情不愿，并且只要有机会，就会偷税漏税。对这些人来说，他们的家庭和自己的肉体才是邻舍。</p>

430. 與義相關的社會責任主要是納稅。納稅的責任不要與工作的責任相混淆。屬靈人納稅的感受不同于屬世人。屬靈人繳稅時抱著良善的願望, 因為稅款被用於國家運作,國防,保衛教會, 以及用來支付官員與行政人員的管理費用, 他們的薪水要從公共的國庫中支取。因此, 那些視他們的國家和他們的教會為鄰舍的人們, 自願慷慨地繳稅, 認為逃稅與騙稅是錯誤的。但是, 那些並不視自己的國家與教會為鄰舍的人們, 極不情願地繳稅, 且有抵觸情緒。只要有機會, 就逃避納稅, 甚至拒繳稅款。對這些人來說, 他們的家庭與自己的肉體才是鄰舍。 </p>

430. Public obligations that are related to goodwill are primarily the paying of taxes. These taxes are not to be confused with obligations connected with our jobs. Spiritual people pay their taxes with a different feeling at heart than people who are merely earthly. Spiritual people pay taxes in a spirit of goodwill, because the taxes are collected to preserve the country and protect both it and the church. The taxes also pay for administration by government officials whose salaries and stipends have to be paid out of the public treasury. Therefore people who hold their country and their church as their neighbor pay taxes uncoerced, of their own free will, and consider it wrong to cheat or avoid them. People who do not hold their country or church as their neighbor, on the other hand, perform their tax-paying obligations unwillingly and with resistance. As often as the opportunity arises, they cheat and conceal their assets, because the neighbor they focus on is their own household and their own skin. </p>

430. Public charitable duties are chiefly taxes and excise duties, which must not be confused with the duties of office. Those who are spiritual feel differently about paying them from those who are purely natural. Spiritual people pay them with a good will, because they are collected to run the country, to protect it and the church, and to pay for its administration by officials and governors, whose salaries and stipends have to be paid out of the public treasury. Those therefore who regard their country and their church as the neighbour pay their taxes freely and willingly, thinking it wrong to cheat and evade them. But those who do not regard their country and church as the neighbour pay them unwillingly and reluctantly, defrauding the collector and withholding money whenever they have an opportunity. For these people their home and their flesh are the neighbour. </p>

430. The public duties of charity are especially the payment of tribute and taxes, which ought not to be confounded with official duties. Those who are spiritual pay these with one disposition of heart, and those who are merely natural with another. The spiritual pay them from good will, because they are collected for the preservation of their country, and for its protection and the protection of the church, also for the administration of government by officials and governors, to whom salaries and stipends must be paid from the public treasury. Those, therefore, to whom their country and also the church are the neighbor, pay their taxes willingly and cheerfully, and regard it as iniquitous to deceive or defraud. But those to whom their country and the church are not the neighbor pay them unwillingly and with resistance; and at every opportunity defraud and withhold; for to such their own household and their own flesh are the neighbor. </p>

<p>
430. The public duties of charity are especially imposts and taxes, and these must not be confused with the duties of office. Imposts and taxes are paid in a different spirit by those who are spiritual and by those who are merely natural. Those who are spiritual pay them with a good will, because they are collected for the preservation and protection of their country and the Church, and also for the administration of these by officials and leaders, whose salaries and stipends must be paid out of public funds. Therefore, those who regard their country and the Church as the neighbor pay such debts willingly and with a good grace, considering it iniquitous either to make a false return or evade payment; whereas those who do not regard their country and the Church as the neighbor pay them unwillingly, and with no good grace; and whenever they have an opportunity they defraud the collectors and withhold payment. Such persons regard their own kith and kin as the neighbor. </p>

430. DEBITA CHARITATIS PUBLICA, sunt imprimis Tributa et Vectigalia, quae non cum debitis functionum commiscenda sunt; illa pendunt alio corde illi qui spirituales sunt, et alio illi qui mere naturales sunt; Spirituales pendunt illa ex bene velle, quia sunt Collectae pro Conservatione Patriae, et pro Tutatione ejus et Ecclesiae, proque administratione per officiarios et praefectos, quibus salaria et stipendia ex Publico Aerario impendenda sunt; quare illi, quibus Patria et quoque Ecclesia sunt Proximus, ex Voluntate spontanea et secundante solvunt illa, et pro iniquitate reputant fallere et frustrare; at illi, quibus Patria et Ecclesia non sunt Proximus, voluntate invita et repugnante praestant illa, et quoties datur ansa defraudant et surripiunt; apud hos enim Domus sua et Caro sua sunt Proximus. </p>
