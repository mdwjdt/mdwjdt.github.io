<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第385节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>385</b>.对此，我补充以下记事。记事一：<br />有位天使曾对我说：“你想清楚了解什么是信与仁，什么是与仁分离之信、与仁结合之信吗？我会给你一个形像的说明。”“有请！”我回答。他说：“把仁和信想象成光和热，你就会清楚明白。信就其本质而言，是属于智慧的真理；仁就其本质而言，是属于爱的情感。在天堂，智之真是光，爱之情是热。天使所享有的光和热本质上并非别的东西。由此你还能清楚明白，何为与仁分离之信，何为与仁结合之信。与仁分离之信就像冬天的光，与仁结合之信则像春天的光。冬天的光因与热分离，故与寒冷结合。这光使树叶调零、草木枯萎、大地坚硬、诸水结冰。但春天的光因与热结合，使树木枝繁叶茂、开花结果；并打开和松软大地，以便它长出青草、草本、鲜花；它还融化坚冰，使之成为泉水的源头。<br />“这恰似信与仁的情形。与仁分离之信使万物枯亡，而与仁结合之信则使万物复活。在我们的世界，就是灵界，这一生一死能活生生地被看到。因为在这里，信就是光，仁就是热。哪里有信与仁的结合，哪里就有乐园、花园、灌木丛，结合得越紧密，它们就越漂亮。而哪里有信与仁的分离，哪里就寸草不生，仅有的绿色还是荆棘蒺藜带来的。”不远处站着几位牧师，天使称他们为唯信称义和成圣的信奉者，还称他们为神秘贩子（mystery－mongers）。我们将这些话告诉他们，还给予充分证明，以使他们看到真理。但当我们问他们是不是这样时，他们却转身离开，说：“我们没听见。”于是我们提高嗓门向他们喊着说：“那请再听一次！”可他们却捂住耳朵叫嚷：“我们不想听！”<br />闻听此言，我便与这位天使谈到了“唯信”，并说我蒙恩得以通过亲身经历知道这种信就象冬天的光。我告诉他，数年来，具有各种信念的精灵从我面前经过，每当那些将信从仁分离之人靠近我时，这种寒气就从脚生起，逐渐侵袭到腰，最后直逼胸膛，我只感觉体内的整个生命之火即将熄灭，别的几乎什么也不知道了。若不是主赶走那些精灵，使我恢复自由，这种事真就发生了。令我震惊的是，正如这些精灵自己所承认的，他们一点也不觉得冷。所以，我将他们比作冰下之鱼，因为它们也不觉得冷，其生命和本性原本就如此寒冷。然后，我发现这寒冷是从他们信的昏昧之光散发出来的，很像隆冬日落之后从沼泽和硫磺地发出的寒冷。旅行者们经常会看到这种昏昧、寒冷之光。这类精灵还好比从北极之地断裂的冰山，在海上到处飘流。关于这些冰山，我曾听说，一靠近它们，全体船员都会冻得瑟瑟发抖。因此，具有与仁分离之信的精灵若成群结队，就好比这些冰山，若愿意，你也可以这样称呼他们。从圣言清楚可知，无仁之信是死的；不过，我会说说它为何会死。它死于寒冷，是这寒冷杀死了信，就像严冬里的小鸟被冻死那样。它先是失去视觉，同时失去飞行的能力，最后停止呼吸，从树枝上径直掉下来，被雪埋葬。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #385 </h4>
<p>
385. 關於本章的觀點, 我將闡述一下幾個親身經歷。
<p>第一個經歷:
<p>有位天人曾對我說:"你想清楚瞭解什麼是信與義, 與義分離的信如何, 與義聯合的信又如何？我想給你一個形像的說明。"
<p>"有請！"我回答。
<p>"代替信與義, "他說:"請思考光與熱, 你將看得清楚。信, 就本質而言, 是與智慧相關的真理; 義, 就本質而言, 是與仁愛相關的情感。在天國, 與智慧相關的真理就是光, 與仁愛相關的情感就是熱。天人們享受的光與熱, 本質上就是如此, 並非其它什麼。由此你還能清楚看得出, 與義分離或聯合的信像什麼。與義分離的信如同寒冬裡的光, 與義聯合的信則如同春天裡的光。寒冬季節的光, 光中無熱, 與寒冷相連, 徹底剝光樹上的葉子, 殺死小草, 令土地堅硬水結冰。然而春天裡的光, 是與熱相連的光, 令樹木生長, 生出嫩葉, 開花結果; 還解封鬆軟土地, 長出小草,鮮花,灌木等植物, 還使堅冰融化, 泉水再次從源頭流出。
<p>[2]"信與義確實也是如此:與義分離的信令帶來死亡, 與義聯合的信帶來生命。在我們所在的心靈世界, 這樣帶來死與生的情形能明明看見, 因為在這裡的信為光,義為熱。哪裡有義與信聯合, 哪裡就是樂園,花園與草地。但是哪裡義與信分離, 那裡寸草不生, 唯一的綠色只是荊棘刺條所產生的。"
<p>不遠處站著幾位牧師, 天人稱他們為唯信稱義成聖的信奉者, 還稱他們為神秘主義製造者。我們將同樣的內容告訴他們, 還列舉了充足的證據, 以便讓他們知道所說內容的真實。然而, 當我們問他們:"是這樣嗎？"他們轉身走開, 說:"我們沒聽見。"於是我們提高嗓門向他們喊著說:"那請注意聽！"可是他們伸手蒙著雙耳, 叫嚷著:"我們不想聽！"
<p>[3]聽完這些之後, 我與天人談論"唯信"。我跟他說, 自己的生活經歷讓我能理解"唯信"就像寒冬裡的光。我告訴他, 數年來遇到過擁有各種不同類型之信的靈經過我。每當那些將信與義分離的靈靠近時, 寒氣從腳生起, 逐漸侵到腰間, 最後直逼胸膛, 除了感覺生命之火即將熄滅, 別無他想。如果不是主將那些靈驅走, 讓我恢復自由, 否則我真的會死去。
<p>另外一件讓我驚奇之事:正如他們自己承認, 這些靈自身一點不覺得冷。我將他們比作冰下之魚, 自身不覺得一點冷, 因為它們的生命與屬性原本如此寒冷。
<p>從信的虛假之光散發而出的寒冷, 很像仲冬季節裡太陽下山後沼澤與硫磺之地散發的寒冷。旅行者們不時看見如此寒冷的虛假之光。
<p>他們還好比脫離北極之地的冰山, 飄到海上各處。我曾聽說, 當船隻靠近這些冰山時, 全體船員都冷得發抖。信與義分離的靈成群時, 就如同這些冰山; 如果你喜歡, 可以稱之為"冰山"。
<p>從經上可知, 無義之信是死的。我要說說為何會死:它死於寒冷, 這樣的信如同嚴冬裡的小鳥被扼殺; 先是視覺消失, 接著喪失飛翔的能力, 最後呼吸停止, 從樹枝徑直摔下, 葬在雪中。 </p>

385. To these points I will add these memorable occurrences.
<p>The first memorable occurrence. Once an angel said to me, "Do you want to see clearly what faith and goodwill are, and therefore what faith separated from goodwill is, and what faith united to goodwill is? I will express it in visual terms for you. "
<p>"Please do!" I answered.
<p>The angel said, "Instead of faith and goodwill, think of light and heat, and you will see them clearly. Faith in its essence is truth that relates to wisdom. Goodwill in its essence is affection that relates to love. In heaven, truth related to wisdom is light and affection related to love is heat. The light and heat that angels live in are, in essence, exactly this. As a result, you can clearly see what faith is when it is separated from goodwill and what it is when it is united to goodwill.
<p>"When faith is separated from goodwill, it is like the light in winter. When faith is united to goodwill, it is like the light in spring. The light in winter, which is a light separated from heat, is united to coldness; therefore it completely strips trees of their leaves, kills grass, makes ground as hard as rock, and freezes water. Light in spring, which is a light united to heat, causes trees to grow, first producing leaves, then flowers, and finally fruit; it also unlocks and softens the ground so that it produces grass, plants, flowers, and shrubs; and it melts ice, so that water flows from its sources again.
</p>
<p>
[2] "The situation with faith and goodwill is absolutely identical. Faith separated from goodwill kills everything. Faith united to goodwill brings everything to life. This killing and this bringing to life are vividly visible in this spiritual world of ours, because here faith is light and goodwill is heat. Where faith has been united to goodwill there is a paradise of gardens, flower beds, and lawns; the more united faith and goodwill are, the more pleasing the gardens are. Where faith has been separated from goodwill, there is not even grass; the only greenness comes from thorns and brambles. "
<p>At that point there were some members of the clergy not far away. The angel called them "justifiers and sanctifiers of people through faith alone" and also "arcanists. " We said the same things to the members of the clergy and added enough proof that they could see that what we said was true. But when we asked them, "Isn't that so?" they turned away and said, "We didn't hear you. " So we cried out to them and said, "Then keep listening to us," but they put both hands over their ears and shouted, "We don't want to hear you!"
</p>
<p>
[3] Afterward I spoke to the angel about faith alone. I said that living experience had led me to understand that faith alone is like the light in winter. I told him that for several years spirits with various different types of faith had been walking past me. Every time people who had separated faith from goodwill came near me, such intense coldness would rise up my legs into my groin and finally into my chest that I almost thought the spark of my vitality had been extinguished. I would in fact have died if the Lord had not driven those spirits away and set me free.
<p>Another thing seemed amazing to me: The spirits themselves did not feel any coldness within. They told me so. Therefore I compared those spirits to fish under ice that do not feel the cold because their life and their nature are intrinsically cold.
<p>I was able to perceive at the time that their coldness emanated from the faint, deceptive light of their faith, much like the light that glows around swampy or sulfury places in midwinter after the sun has set. Travelers see that faint, deceptive, frigid light from time to time.
<p>People who have separated faith from goodwill can be compared to mountains of pure ice that have been dislodged from their places in northern lands to drift here and there across the ocean. I have heard it said that when ships come near these icebergs, all who are on board shiver from the cold. Therefore groups of people who have separated faith from goodwill can be likened to icebergs, and even called icebergs if you wish.
<p>People know from the Word that faith without goodwill is dead; but I will say where that death comes from. That death is from the cold. Faith dies of the cold like a bird in a severe winter: first its vision dies, then its ability to fly, and finally its breathing. Then it falls headfirst off its branch into the snow and is buried. </p>

<p>
385. I shall here add accounts of some experiences, of which this is the first.<p>An angel once said to me: 'You want to see clearly what faith and charity are, and so what faith is when separated from charity, and what it is when joined to charity; I will give you a visual demonstration.'<p>'Please do,' I replied.<p>'Instead of faith and charity,' he said, 'think of light and heat, and you will see clearly. Faith in its essence is truth belonging to wisdom, and charity in its essence is affection belonging to love. In heaven truth belonging to wisdom is light, and affection belonging to love is heat. The light and heat the angels enjoy are essentially this and nothing else. From this you can see clearly what faith separated from charity is like, and what faith joined to charity is like. Faith separated from charity is like light in wintertime, and faith joined to charity is like light in springtime. Light in wintertime, being light without heat but combined with cold, completely strips the trees of their leaves, kills off the grass, makes the ground hard and freezes water. But light in springtime, being light combined with heat, makes the trees grow, putting forth first leaves, then flowers, and finally fruits; it opens up and softens the ground, to bring forth grass, plants, flowers and shrubs, and it also melts the ice so that water flows from springs.</p>
<p>
[2] 'It is exactly the same with faith and charity: faith separated from charity makes everything die off, and faith combined with charity makes everything come to life. This coming to life, as well as that dying off, can be seen actually happening in our world, the spiritual one, because here faith is light and charity is heat. For where faith is combined with charity, there are parkland gardens, flower-gardens and shrubberies, the more beautiful, the more closely they are combined. But where faith is separated from charity, not so much as grass grows; and any patch of greenery is produced by thorns and briars.'<p>Not far off were standing some clergymen, whom the angel called believers in men's justification and sanctification by faith alone, as well as mystery-mongers. We told them the same and demonstrated it to them so that they could see that it was so. When we asked whether it was not so, they turned their backs and said, 'We did not hear.' But we shouted at them and said, 'So listen to it again.' However, then they put both hands over their ears and cried: 'We do not want to hear.'</p>
<p>
[3] After hearing this I spoke with the angel about faith on its own and said that I had been allowed to know by personal experience that that sort of faith is like the light of wintertime. I told him how for some years past spirits who had different kinds of faith had passed by me; and whenever those who had separated faith from charity came near, such a chill attacked my feet, and then by degrees my loins and finally my chest, that I hardly knew otherwise than that all the vitality in my body was going to be extinguished. This would actually have happened, if the Lord had not driven those spirits away and freed me.<p>It seemed to me surprising that those spirits did not in themselves feel any chill, as they admitted. So I compared them to fish under ice, for they too do not feel any chill, since their life and thus their nature is essentially so cold. I perceived then that this chill spread from the deceptive light of their faith, much like that which rises after sunset from marshy and sulphurous ground in midwinter. Travellers in all parts see this deceptive, cold light.<p>They can be compared with the icebergs which are torn from their places in arctic lands and are carried hither and thither on the ocean. Of these I have heard it said, that on their approach the crews of ships all shiver with cold. Groups of spirits whose faith is separated from charity can therefore be likened to these icebergs, and if you like you can so call them,<p>It is well known from the Word that faith without charity is dead; but I will say why it dies. It dies of cold, and this kills off faith like a bird in a severe winter. First of all its sight goes, and at the same time its ability to fly; finally its breathing stops, and it falls headlong off the branch into a snowy grave. </p>

<p>
385. The following Memorable Relations shall be added. First: <p>An angel once said to me, "If you wish to see clearly what faith is and what charity is, and thus what faith separate from charity is, and what it is when conjoined with charity, I will make it very clear to you." <p>I answered, "Make it clear." <p>He said, "Instead of faith and charity, think of light and heat, and you will see clearly. Faith in its essence is the truth of wisdom, and charity in its essence is the affection of love; and in heaven the truth of wisdom is light and the affection of love is heat. The light and heat in which angels live are in essence nothing else. From this you can see clearly what faith is when separated from charity and what faith is when conjoined with charity. Faith separated from charity is like the light of winter, and faith conjoined with charity is like the light of spring. Wintry light, which is light separate from heat, because it is joined with cold, wholly strips the trees of their leaves, kills the grass, hardens the earth, and freezes the waters. But the light of spring, which is light joined with heat, causes the trees to put forth leaves, and then flowers, and finally fruit; it so opens and softens the earth that it may bring forth grasses, herbs, flowers, and it so melts the ice that the waters flow from their fountains.
</p>
<p>
[2] It is precisely the same with faith and charity. Faith when separated from charity makes all things dead, while faith joined with charity makes all things alive. This making alive and making dead can be seen to the life in our spiritual world, because here faith is light and charity is heat. Where faith is joined with charity, there are paradisal gardens, flower-beds, and grass-plots with a native charm according to that conjunction. But where faith is separated from charity, there is not even grass, and where there is any green it is from briers and thorns." <p>Not far from us at this time were some clergymen, whom the angel called justifiers and sanctifiers of men by faith alone, and also dealers in mysteries. To these we said the same things, and made them so clear that they saw their truth; but when we asked them if it was not so, they turned away and said, "We did not hear you." We then shouted to them, saying, "Then hear us yet again." But they put both hands to their ears and called out, "We do not wish to hear you."
</p>
<p>
[3] After hearing this I talked with the angel about faith alone, saying that it had been granted me to know by living experience that that faith is like the light of winter. And I told him that for several years spirits of various beliefs had passed by me, and that whenever those who separated faith from charity came near me, such a coldness invaded my feet and gradually my loins and finally my chest, that I hardly knew otherwise than that the whole vitality of my body was about to become extinct; and indeed this would have come to pass if the Lord had not driven these spirits away and set me free. To me it seemed wonderful that these spirits, as they acknowledged, had in themselves no sense of coldness; and I therefore likened them to fishes under ice, which have no feeling of cold because their life and their nature therefrom are essentially cold. It then became clear that the cold of these spirits emanated from the fatuous light of their faith, as the fatuous and cold light often seen by travelers arises from marshy and sulphurous places in midwinter after sunset. Such spirits may be compared to the icebergs that are torn from their places in the northern regions, and carried about on the ocean, of which I have heard it said that when they come near a ship, all who are on board begin to shiver with cold. So companies of spirits who are in faith separated from charity may be likened to such icebergs, or, if you please, may be called icebergs. It is well known from the Word that faith apart from charity is dead; but I will explain the cause of its death. Its death is from cold. It dies from cold like a bird in a severe winter. First its sight fails, and at the same time its power to fly; and then its power to breathe; and finally it falls headlong from the tree into the snow and is buried. </p>

<p>
385. MEMORABILIA.<p>To the above will now be added the following Memorabilia.<p>The first experience. A certain angel once said to me, "As you are desirous of perceiving clearly the nature of faith and charity, and thus what faith is when separated from charity, and what it is when united to charity, I will make it clear by visual illustration." I replied, "Do so." Then he said: "Instead of faith and charity, think of light and heat, and you will see clearly. Faith in its essence is the truth of wisdom, and charity in its essence is the affection of love. In heaven the truth of wisdom is light, and the affection of love is heat; and the light and heat in which angels dwell are essentially nothing else. From this you may perceive clearly the nature of faith when separated from charity, and of faith when united to charity. Faith separated from charity is like the light of winter, and faith united to charity is like the light of spring. The light of winter, which is light without heat, because it is combined with cold, entirely strips the trees, even of their leaves, kills the grass, hardens the ground, and freezes the water. But the light of spring, which is light combined with heat, causes the trees to put forth, first leaves, then flowers, and finally fruit. It opens up and softens the ground, so that it produces grasses, herbs, flowers and shrubs; and it also melts the ice, so that the waters flow from their sources.</p>
<p>
[2] "The case is exactly similar with faith and charity. Faith separated from charity brings death to all things, and faith united to charity imparts life to all things. This quickening and this deadening effect may be vividly seen in our spiritual world, because here faith is light, and charity heat. For where faith is united to charity, there are beautiful gardens, flower-beds and shrubberies, pleasant in proportion to such union; but where faith is separated from charity, there not even grass grows, nor is there any green thing but thorns and briars."<p>At that moment there were standing not far away certain of the clergy, whom the angels called justifiers and sanctifiers of men by faith alone and dealers in mysteries. We repeated to them this account of faith and charity, with the illustrations to make it clear to them; but when we asked them if it was clear, they turned away and said, "We did not hear you." We then called out to them, "Hear us once more," but they forthwith stopped their ears with both hands and exclaimed, "We do not wish to hear."</p>
<p>
[3] After hearing these things I spoke with the angel about faith alone, and said that it had been granted to me to know by actual experience that such faith is like the light of winter. I related that for several years spirits of various beliefs had passed before me. Whenever those drew near me who separated faith from charity, such a coldness seized my feet, gradually extending to my loins and breast, that I almost imagined all vitality had departed from my body. This indeed would have happened had not the Lord driven them away, and thus delivered me. I was surprised that those spirits themselves, as they confessed, did not have any sensation of cold. I therefore compared them to fish which live under ice but do not feel any cold, as their life and thus their nature are in themselves cold. I then perceived that this cold proceeded from the delusive light of their faith, which is like the delusive and cold light travelers often see here and there rising from marshy and sulphurous ground in the depth of winter after sunset. Such spirits may also be compared to icebergs, which, broken off from glaciers in the north, are carried about on the ocean. Of these I have heard it said that, when they approach a ship, all on board shiver with the cold. Companies of such spirits who are in faith separated from charity may be likened to icebergs, and may even be so called. We know from the Word that faith without charity is dead; and the cause of its death may be stated thus: It perishes from cold like a bird in a severe frost. The bird loses first its sight, then its power to fly, and lastly its power to breathe. Then falling headlong from its perch it is buried in the snow. </p>

385. His adjungentur haec MEMORABILIA; PRIMUM. Quondam mihi dixit aliquis Angelus, vis videre clare quid FIDES et CHARITAS, ita quid Fides separata a Charitate, et quid Fides conjuncta Charitati, et demonstrabo ad oculum; respondi, demonstra; et dixit, cogita pro Fide et Charitate Lucem et Calorem, et clare videbis; Fides in sua essentia est Veritas quae sapientiae, et Charitas in sua essentia est Affectio amoris, ac Veritas sapientiae in Coelo est Lux, et Affectio amoris in Coelo est Calor; Lux et Calor in quo sunt Angeli, essentialiter non aliud sunt; exinde videre potes clare quid Fides separata a Charitate, et quid Fides conjuncta Charitati. Fides separata a Charitate est sicut Lux hyemalis, ac Fides conjuncta Charitati est sicut Lux vernalis: Lux hyemalis, quae est Lux separata a Calore, quae quia est conjuncta frigori, prorsus denudat arbores etiam a foliis, enecat gramen, indurat terram, et congelat aquas: Lux autem vernalis, quae est Lux conjuncta calori, vegetat arbores, primum in folia, tum in flores, et denique in fructus, aperit et emollit terram, ut producat gramina, herbas, flores et frutices, et quoque solvit glaciem, ut fluant e fontibus aquae.</p>
<p>
[2] Prorsus simile est cum Fide et Charitate; Fides separata a Charitate mortificat omnia, et Fides conjuncta Charitati vivificat omnia: Vivificatio haec et Mortificatio illa, ad vivum possunt videri in Mundo nostro spirituali, quia hic est Fides Lux, et Charitas Calor; ubi enim Fides conjuncta Charitati est, ibi sunt Horti paradisiaci, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Floreta et Vireta in sua amoenitate secundum conjunctionem: at ubi Fides separata a Charitate est, ibi ne quidem gramen est, et ubi viride, est id ex vepribus et sentibus: Erant tunc non procul aliqui ex Clero, quos Angelus vocabat Justificatores et Sanctificatores hominum per solam fidem, et quoque Arcanistas; eadem haec diximus illis, et demonstravimus usque ut viderent quod ita sit, et cum quaesivimus, annon ita, averterunt se, et dixerunt, non audivimus; at clamavimus ad illos dicendo, audite itaque adhuc, sed tunc ponebant ambas manus ante aures, ac vociferati, non volumus audire.</p>
<p>
[3] Post haec audita loquutus sum cum Angelo de Fide solitaria, et dixi, quod per vivam experientiam mihi datum sit scire, quod illa Fides sit sicut Lux hyemalis; et narravi, quod per aliquot annos praeteriverint me Spiritus ex varia fide, et quod quoties approximarunt illi, qui separaverunt Fidem a Charitate, tale frigus invaserit pedes meos, et successive lumbos et demum pectus, ut vix scirem aliter quam quod omne vitale corporis mei exstinctum iret; quod etiam evenisset, nisi Dominus abegisset Spiritus illos, et me liberavisset: hoc mirabile mihi visum est, quod ipsi illi Spiritus non sentirent aliquod frigus in se, hoc fassi sunt, quare comparavi illos cum piscibus sub glacie, qui nec aliquod frigus sentiunt, quoniam vita et inde natura eorum in se est frigida: percepi tunc, quod frigus illud ex luce fatua fidei illorum emanaverit, similiter ut fit ex locis palustribus et sulphureis temporibus mediae hyemis postquam Sol occidit; talem lucem fatuam et frigidam viatores passim vident. Illi comparari possunt montibus ex mera glacie divulsis e locis suis in terris borealibus, qui in Oceano hic et ibi feruntur, de quibus narratum audivi, quod ad approximationem illorum omnes qui super navibus sunt, ex frigore contremiscant; quare Caetus ex illis, qui in fide separata a charitate sunt, assimilari possunt illis montibus, et si lubet ita etiam vocari. Notum est ex Verbo, quod Fides absque charitate sit mortua, at dicam unde ejus mors; mors ejus est ex frigore, et ex quo Fides illa exspirat sicut avis in intensa bruma, quae primum moritur quoad visum, et simul tunc <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
quoad volatum, et demum quoad respirationem, et tunc praeceps e ramo decidit in nivem, et insepelitur.<p>
