663. The third memorable occurrence. On one occasion I was among angels and was listening to their conversation. They were discussing intelligence and wisdom, and the fact that people sense and perceive these two entirely as if they were part of themselves; therefore they think that any wanting or thinking they do, they do on their own. Yet in fact there is not a scrap of intelligence or wisdom in people; there is only a faculty to receive them.
<p>Among a number of things the angels were saying was this: The tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden symbolized the belief that intelligence and wisdom come from ourselves. The tree of life symbolized the belief that intelligence and wisdom come from God. Because Adam, influenced by the serpent, ate from the former tree, and because he believed that he either was already or would become like God, he was expelled from the garden and condemned.
</p>
<p>
[2] As the angels were having this conversation, two priests came along, and also a man who had been an ambassador in the world. I related to them what I had just heard from the angels about intelligence and wisdom.
<p>These three started to argue with each other about what they had just heard. They also brought up the topic of prudence, and whether it, too, comes from God or from ourselves. There was strong disagreement among them. Interestingly, the three of them actually shared the same belief, which was that prudence, intelligence, and wisdom come from ourselves; they believed this because our sensations and the awareness we get from them support this point of view. The two priests, however, who were feeling a kind of theological zeal at that moment, were insisting that we have no intelligence or wisdom, and therefore no prudence, from ourselves. They gave the following passage from the Word as support: "We cannot receive anything unless it is given to us from heaven" (<a href="3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>). They also cited what Jesus said to his disciples: "Without me you cannot do anything" (<a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] The angels perceived, however, that no matter what the priests were saying, at heart they had the same belief as the ambassador. Therefore the angels said to the priests, "Take off your robes, and put on the clothing worn by representatives of the state, and believe that that is what you are. "
<p>They did so. Then their thinking came from their inner self, and they voiced the opinions they had held inwardly, namely, that all intelligence and all wisdom reside in human beings and belong to them.
<p>"Who still feels nowadays that these things flow in from God?" they said, and looked in each other's direction and gave each other support.
<p>A feature that is unique to the spiritual world is that spirits think they actually are whatever they are dressed to look like. This is because our understanding is what clothes us there.
</p>
<p>
[4] At that very moment a tree appeared beside them. They were told, "This is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Take care not to eat from it. "
<p>Because their idea that their intelligence came from themselves had made them foolish, despite the warning they felt a burning desire to eat from it, and were saying to each other, "Why not? Fruit is good. " And they went up to the tree and ate.
<p>When the ambassador noticed them doing this, he joined them. They all became close friends and traveled together hand in hand on the path of their own intelligence, which leads down into hell. A bit later I saw them coming back from there, though, because they were not quite ready for hell yet. </p>

The third experience.<p>I was once in company with angels and listened to their conversation. They were talking about intelligence and wisdom, saying that a person has no other feeling and perception but that intelligence and wisdom are both in him, and so whatever he wills and thinks comes from him. Yet in fact not a scrap of either comes from the person, apart from the ability to receive them. Among the many things they said was this, that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden stood for a belief that intelligence and wisdom were from man, and the tree of life stood for a belief that intelligence and wisdom were from God. It was because Adam was persuaded by the serpent to eat from the former tree, believing that he would be or become God, that he was ejected from the garden and damned.</p>
<p>
[2] While the angels were discussing this, two priests arrived accompanied by a man who in the world had been a country's ambassador. I repeated to them what I had heard from the angels about intelligence and wisdom, and on hearing this the three of them began to argue about these two subjects and also about prudence, whether they were from God or from man. It was a fierce argument. All three believed alike that these came from man, because their actual feeling and so their perception supported this view; but the priests, being then under the influence of theological zeal, insisted that no part of intelligence and wisdom, and so of prudence, came from man. They found confirmation of that in these passages of the Word:<p>A man cannot take anything, unless it is given him from heaven, <a href="3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>.<p>Jesus said to the disciples, Without me you can do nothing, <a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] But the angels allowed me to perceive that, however much the priests talked like this, they still at heart held similar beliefs to the ambassador's. So the angels said to them: 'Take off your clothes and put on those of ministers of state, and believe that is what you are.' They did so, and then they thought from their interiors, and in talking used the arguments they inwardly supported; these were that all intelligence and wisdom reside in man and are his. 'Who,' they said, 'has ever felt that these flow in from God?' They looked at each other and backed each other up.<p>It is a special feature of the spiritual world that a spirit thinks himself to be what the clothes he wears indicate. The reason is that it is the understanding which clothes each person there.</p>
<p>
[4] At that instant a tree was seen near them, and they were told: 'It is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; beware of eating from it.' Yet they were so infatuated with their own intelligence that they had a burning desire to eat from it, and they said to each other: 'Why shouldn't we? Isn't the fruit good?' So they went up to it and ate the fruit.<p>When the ambassador noticed this, they got together and became bosom friends. Then together, holding hands, they took the way of their own intelligence, which leads to hell. However I saw them brought back from there, because they were not yet prepared.<p>

663. Third Memorable Relation: <p>I was once in the midst of angels and heard their conversation. It was about intelligence and wisdom, to the effect that man has no other feeling or perception than that these are in himself, and therefore that whatever he wills and thinks is from himself, and yet no least part of these is from man, except the ability to receive them. Among other things that they said was this, that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden of Eden, signified the belief that intelligence and wisdom are from man; and that the tree of life signified that intelligence and wisdom are from God; and because Adam by the persuasion of the serpent ate of the former tree, believing that thus he had become or would become as God, he was driven out of the garden and condemned.
</p>
<p>
[2] While the angels were engaged in this conversation, there came two priests and also a man who in the world had been a royal ambassador, and I told them what I had heard about intelligence and wisdom from the angels; hearing which the three began to dispute about these, and also about prudence, whether they were from God or from man. The dispute was warm. The three believed alike that they were from man, because this is the testimony of sensation itself and of perception therefrom; but the priests, who at the time were influenced by theological zeal, insisted that nothing of intelligence or wisdom, and therefore nothing of prudence, is from man, and this they confirmed by the following passages from the Word: <p>A man can take nothing, except it be given him from heaven (<a href="3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>). <p>Also by this: <p>Jesus said to His disciples, Without Me ye are unable to do anything (<a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] Then, because the angels perceived that although the priests talked so, they still in heart believed the same as the royal ambassador, they said to them, "Lay aside your garments, and put on the garments of ministers of state, and believe that you are such." They did so; and then they thought from their interior selves, and spoke according to the opinions which they inwardly cherished, which were, that all intelligence and wisdom dwell in man and are his; and they said, "Who has ever felt the influx of these from God?" And they looked at one another, and were convinced. <p>It is peculiar to the spiritual world that a spirit thinks himself to be such as his dress is. This is because in that world the understanding clothes everyone.
</p>
<p>
[4] At that moment a tree appeared near them, and it was said to them, "That is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; be careful not to eat of it." Nevertheless, infatuated by their own intelligence, they burned with the lust to eat of it, and said to one another, "Why not? Is it not good fruit?" And they drew near and ate of it. <p>When the royal ambassador observed this he joined them, and they became hearty friends; and holding each other by the hand they together went the way of their own intelligence which tended towards hell. But I saw them brought back therefrom, because they were not yet prepared. </p>

663. The third experience. I was once in the company of some angels and heard their conversation, which was about intelligence and wisdom. They said that man does not feel or perceive otherwise than that both are in himself; and, consequently, that whatever he wills and thinks is from himself; whereas nothing of intelligence and wisdom is from man, but only the faculty of receiving them. Among many other things, they said that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden of Eden signified the belief that intelligence and wisdom were from man; and that the tree of life signified that intelligence and wisdom were from God. And because Adam, by the persuasion of the serpent, ate of the former tree, thus believing that he would become as God, he was driven out of the garden and condemned.</p>
<p>
[2] While the angels were engaged in this conversation there came up two priests, and with them a man who in the world had been an ambassador of a kingdom. I related to them what I had heard from the angels respecting intelligence and wisdom. Then the three began to dispute about these virtues, and also about prudence, whether they are from God or from man. The dispute was warm; although all three entertained the same belief that they are from man, because sensation itself and perception arising from it confirm this. The priests, however, who were at the moment influenced by theological zeal, insisted that nothing of intelligence and wisdom, and consequently of prudence, is from man, and this they proved by the following passages from the Word:<p>"A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven" <a href="3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>;<p>Jesus said to the disciples, "Without me ye can do nothing" <a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] As the angels perceived that, although the priests spoke in this way, they still believed at heart the same as the ambassador, they said to the priests: "Take off your own garments and put on those of ministers of state, and suppose yourselves to be statesmen." They did so; and then they thought from their interior self, and argued in favor of the opinions which they inwardly maintained, saying, "Who has ever yet felt that they flowed in from God?" and exchanging looks, they supported each other in their views. It is a peculiarity of the spiritual world that spirits suppose they are what their dress represents them to be; this is because the understanding clothes every one there.</p>
<p>
[4] At that instant a tree appeared near them, and they were told, "This is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; take heed that you do not eat of it." But infatuated with their own intelligence, they ardently desired to eat of it, and said to each other, "Why not? Is not the fruit good?" So they drew near and ate. When the ambassador observed this, he joined them, and they became cordial friends, walking hand in hand along the way of their own intelligence, which led towards hell. However, I saw them coming back, because they were not yet prepared. </p>

663. TERTIUM MEMORABILE.<p>Quondam fui in medio Angelorum, et audivi sermonem illorum; sermo illorum erat de Intelligentia et Sapientia, quod homo non sentiat et percipiat aliter, quam quod utraque sit in se, et sic quod quicquid vult et cogitat, sit ex se, cum tamen ne hilum illarum ex homine est, praeter quam facultas recipiendi illas; inter plura, quae loquebantur, erat etiam hoc, quod Arbor scientiae boni et mali in Horto Edenis significaverit fidem quod Intelligentia et Sapientia essent ab homine, et quod Arbor vitae significaverit quod Intelligentia et Sapientia essent a Deo, et quia Adamus ex suasu serpentis comedit ex priore Arbore, sic credens quod esset aut fieret sicut Deus, ideo expulsus est ex Horto et damnatus.</p>
<p>
[2] Angeli dum in hoc sermone erant, venerunt duo Sacerdotes, una cum Viro, qui in Mundo fuerat Legatus Regni, et illis retuli quae ab Angelis audiveram de Intelligentia et Sapientia, quibus auditis coeperunt tres illi disceptare de utraque illa, et quoque de Prudentia, num sint a Deo, vel num ab homine; ardens erat disceptatio; tres illi crediderunt similiter, quod sint ab homine, quia ipsa sensatio et inde perceptio id confirmant, sed Sacerdotes, qui tunc erant in zelo Theologico, instabant, quod nihil Intelligentiae et Sapientiae, et sic nihil prudentiae sint ab homine, et hoc confirmabant ex his in Verbo, Non potest homo sumere quicquam, nisi sit datum illi e Coelo, <a href="3927/john_3_27.htm">Johannes 3:27</a>. Et ex his, Jesus dixit ad Discipulos, sine Me non potestis facere quicquam, <a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">Johannes 15:5</a> </p>
<p>
[3] sed tunc quia perceptum erat ex Angelis, quod utcunque Sacerdotes ita loquebantur, usque corde crederent simile quod Legatus Regni, quare Angeli dicebant ad illos, exuite vestes vestras, ac induite vestes Ministrorum Politicorum, et credite quod illi sitis, ac fecerunt ita, et tunc cogitaverunt ex interiori se, ac loquuti ex argumentis quae intus foverunt, quae erant, quod omnis intelligentia et sapientia habitent in homine, et quod sint ejus, dicentes, quis adhuc sensit, quod illae influxerint a Deo, ac inspectabant se mutuo, et se confirmabant; peculiare est in Mundo spirituali, quod Spiritus cogitet se talem esse, qualis super illum est vestis; causa est, quia Intellectus vestit unumquemvis ibi.</p>
<p>
[4] Eo momento apparuit Arbor juxta illos, et dicebatur illis, est Arbor scientiae boni et mali; cavete vobis ne edatis ab illa, at usque illi infatuati propria Intelligentia arserunt cupiditate edendi ex illa, et dicebant inter se, cur non; estne bonus fructus, et accesserunt et comederunt; cum Legatus Regni hoc animadvertit, coiverunt, et amici cordis facti sunt, et viam propriae intelligentiae, quae in Infernum tetendit, tenentes se manibus, simul iverunt; sed usque illos vidi reduces inde, quia nondum erant praeparati. </p>
