<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>205</b>.古时，外邦民族的偶像崇拜仪式起源于对应学。这是因为地上可见的一切事物都具有对应的含义，这不仅适用于各种树木，还适用于各种鸟兽，以及鱼类和其它事物。通晓对应学的古人为自己制作了各种对应于天上观念的形像，并以此为乐，因为它们表示诸如属于天堂和教会之类的事物。因此，他们不仅将这些形像摆在他们的神殿中，还摆在自己家里，不是为了敬拜，而是为了联想到它们所表示的天上观念。正因如此，埃及以及其它地方都有牛犊、公牛和蛇的形像，更用不说孩子、老人和少女的形像了。牛犊和公牛表属世人的情感和力量，蛇表感官人的精明和狡猾。孩子表纯真和仁爱，老人表智慧，少女表对真理的情感，等等。当对应学逐渐丧失后，他们的后代因这些形像被古人摆在神殿之内或附近，便开始视它们为神圣，最终奉之为神明。由于同样的原因，古人在园子和树林中根据不同种类的树木进行敬拜，也在大山小山上敬拜。园子和树林表智慧和聪明，每种树都表示与之相关的某种事物。例如，橄榄树表爱之良善，葡萄树表出自那良善的真理，香柏树表理性良善与真理；大山表最高天堂，小山表在它之下的天堂。直到主降世之时，对应学一直保存在许多东方人当中。这一事实从主降生时，东方智者来拜祂可以看出来。因此，有星星在他们前头行，他们还带来黄金、乳香和没药这三样礼物（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.1.htm">马太福音2:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.11.htm">11</a>）。在他们前头行的“星星”表从天堂得来的知识，“黄金”表属天之善，“乳香”表属灵之善，“没药”表属世之善；一切敬拜都是从这三种良善发出的。然而，以色列和犹太民族全然不知对应学，尽管其敬拜的一切细节，摩西给他们所立的一切律例典章，以及圣言中的一切事物纯粹是对应。这是因为犹太人内心里其实是偶像崇拜者，因此具有这样的秉性：他们甚至不想知道他们的敬拜中存在任何具有属天或属灵之义的东西，因为他们以为其敬拜的一切事物本身都是神圣的。因此，若将属天、属灵之物揭示给他们，他们不仅会拒绝，还会进行亵渎。由于这个原因，天堂向他们关闭，以致他们几乎不知道永生的存在。这一真相从以下事实明显看出来：他们不承认主，即使整部圣经都是关于主的预言，并预言了祂的到来。他们拒绝祂的唯一原因在于，祂指示给他们的是天上的国，而非地上的国。因为他们想要一位弥赛亚来，好让他们凌驾于全世界所有民族之上，而不是想要关注其永恒救赎的那一位。</p>

205. 在早期, 教會之外的人們, 將對應的研究逐漸演變成偶像崇拜。因為地上可見的萬物都有其對應——不僅各樣的樹木,野獸, 還有各樣的魚,鳥, 甚至其它所有事物。早期深諳此道的人們就造出對應天界事物的各種形像。因為這些形像表徵著天上的和教會的事物, 他們喜愛這些形像。不僅將這些形像置於他們的殿堂之中, 還放在他們的家裡。這樣做, 並非是為了崇拜這些形像, 而是看到這些形像而想起它們所代表的屬天與屬靈之事物。在埃及各地, 有牛,牛犢,蛇, 還有小孩,老人與年青婦人的形像。因為牛犢和牛表示屬世自我的情感和力量; 蛇既表徵謹慎,還表示感官的欺詐之意; 小孩表示純真和善願; 老人表示智慧; 年青婦人表示熱愛真理的各種類型; 等等。
<p>當這些對應的知識逐漸喪失時, 後人開始崇拜他們先祖所立的形像和雕塑。開始只是視之神聖, 後來乾脆奉為神明, 因為他們在殿廟內外都發現有這些形像和雕塑。
<p>因為明白這些對應的知識, 先祖們還在花園和樹叢中敬拜。在什麼花園和樹叢中, 要看那裡有什麼各類的樹木。他們還在大小山岡上敬拜。花園和樹叢表示智慧和知性; 各類的樹木表示智慧和知性的相關方面。例如, 橄欖樹表示由仁愛而來的善行, 而葡萄樹則表示由此善行而來的真見。香柏樹表示理性的善和理。高山表示最高層的天國, 而小山表示較低層級的天國。
<p>對應的知識延續到中東許多地方, 甚至延續到主降世的那個時期, 由此事可得知:當主出生時, 有從中東來的智者探望。有一顆星星在他們前方指引, 他們還帶來黃金,乳香和沒藥等禮物(<a href="3927/matthew_2_1.htm">馬太福音2:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_2_9.htm">9-11</a>)。前方指引的星星表示天上來的知識。黃金表示屬天之善; 乳香表示屬靈之善; 沒藥表示屬世之善。這三者組成一切敬拜之源。
<p>然而, 以色列和猶太人完全無知對應的知識, 儘管他們敬拜儀式的點點滴滴都涉及對應的知識, 甚至通過摩西頒給他們的所有律例和裁決條文, 以及他們的經文所有細節之處, 都是對應。缺乏這些知識的緣由, 是因為這些人本質上都是偶像崇拜者。他們根本無意尋求他們的敬拜儀式包含著什麼屬天或屬靈含義。他們相信一切進行的儀式本身就是神聖的。倘若將支撐儀式的屬天和屬靈內義揭示給他們, 他們不僅拒絕這些根基之義, 還會褻瀆它們。結果就是, 天國如果緊密地貼近他們, 他們對永生卻幾乎無知。
<p>從以下事實可清清楚楚看出以上所述之真實:他們全本的經書都是預言主以及主的降世, 然而當主降世時, 他們卻不承認祂。拒絕祂, 只因一個原因:祂教導的只是個屬天的國, 而非屬世的國。他們想要一個將他們高舉超過萬邦的彌賽亞, 而非關注他們永恆救贖的彌賽亞。 </p>

205. Among people outside the church in early times, the study of correspondences led to forms of idolatry because all things that are visible on earth have a correspondence - not only trees but also animals and birds of every kind, as well as fish, and everything else. Early people involved in the study of correspondences made images that corresponded to things in heaven. They enjoyed these images because the images stood for things related to heaven and the church. They placed these images not only in their temples but also in their homes, not in order to worship them but to be reminded of the heavenly things they meant. In Egypt and elsewhere there were images of calves, oxen, and snakes, as well as children, old people, and young women, because calves and oxen meant the emotions and forces in the earthly self; snakes meant prudence but also the deceitfulness of the senses; children meant innocence and goodwill; old people meant wisdom; and young women meant types of love for the truth; and so on.
<p>When the study of correspondences was wiped out, later generations began worshiping the images and statues erected by the early people. They worshiped them first as sacred objects and then as deities, since they found them in and around temples.
<p>Because of the study of correspondences, the early people had also worshiped in gardens and groves, depending on which species of trees were there. They also worshiped on mountains and hills. Gardens and groves meant wisdom and intelligence; and every tree meant some aspect of wisdom and intelligence. For example, an olive tree meant good actions that come from love, while a grapevine meant the true insights that come from those good actions. A cedar tree meant rational goodness and truth. A mountain meant the highest heaven, and a hill, a heaven below it.
<p>The study of correspondences continued among many in the Middle East even to the time of the Lord's coming, as you can see from the wise ones from the Middle East who came to the Lord when he was born. Therefore a star went before them and they brought gifts with them: gold, frankincense, and myrrh (<a href="3927/matthew_2_1.htm">Matthew 2:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_2_9.htm">9-11</a>). The star that went before them meant knowledge from heaven. Gold meant the heavenly goodness; frankincense, the spiritual goodness; and myrrh, the earthly goodness that together form the source of all worship.
<p>There was absolutely no study of correspondences among the Israelite and Jewish nation, although all the aspects of their worship, all the statutes and judgments given to them through Moses, and all the details throughout their Word were correspondences. The reason for this lack was that at heart the people were idolatrous. They had no desire at all to know that any aspect of their worship meant something heavenly or spiritual. They believed that all their rituals were intrinsically holy. If the heavenly and spiritual underpinnings had been revealed to them, they would have not only rejected those underpinnings but also desecrated them. As a result, heaven was so tightly closed to them that they were scarcely aware that eternal life existed.
<p>The truth of this is very clear from the fact that the people did not acknowledge the Lord even though their entire Sacred Scripture had prophesied about him and foretold his coming. They rejected him for one single reason: he taught them about a heavenly kingdom, not an earthly one. They wanted a Messiah who would lift them above all the nations in the whole world, not some Messiah who was concerned with their eternal salvation. </p>

205. The reason why the idolatrous practices of the gentiles in antiquity originated from the science of correspondences was that everything to be seen on earth has a corresponding meaning; this is true not only of trees, but also animals and birds of every kind, as well as fish and other things. The ancient people who possessed the science of correspondences made themselves images to correspond to heavenly ideas; and they took pleasure in them because they stood for such things as concern heaven and the church. They placed these images therefore not only in their temples, but also in their houses, not so as to worship them, but to call to mind the heavenly ideas they stood for. Hence it was that in Egypt and elsewhere they used images of calves, oxen and snakes, not to mention children, old men and young women. Calves and oxen meant the affections and powers of the natural man, snakes the prudence and craftiness of the man who relies upon his senses. Children meant innocence and charity, old men wisdom, young women affections for truth, and so on. Once the knowledge of correspondences had been wiped out, their descendants started to worship as holy, and finally as deities, the images and statues their ancestors had erected, because they were in or near temples. This too was the reason why the ancients worshipped in gardens and plantations, depending on the species of tree, as well as on mountains and hills. Gardens and plantations meant wisdom and intelligence, and each tree meant some particular detail of them. For instance, the olive meant the good of love, the vine truth coming from that good, the cedar rational good and truth; a mountain meant the highest heaven and a hill the heaven below this.</p>
<p>
[2] The fact that the science of correspondences was preserved among a number of eastern peoples right down to the Lord's coming can be established by the wise men from the east, who came to visit the Lord at the time of His birth; therefore the star went before them, and they brought gifts with them, gold, frankincense and myrrh (<a href="3927/matthew_2_1.htm">Matthew 2:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_2_9.htm">9-11</a>). The star which went before them meant knowledge learned from heaven, gold celestial good, frankincense spiritual good, and myrrh natural good; it is these three kinds of good which are the source of all worship. Nonetheless correspondences were totally unknown to the Israelite and Jewish people, even though all the details of their worship, all their laws and judgments given them by Moses, and everything in the Word were nothing but correspondences. The reason was that they were at heart idolatrous, and therefore of such a character that they did not even want to know that anything in their worship had a celestial or spiritual meaning, since they believed that these things were all in themselves holy. If therefore the celestial and spiritual meanings had been revealed to them, they would not only have rejected them, but also profaned them. On account of this heaven was so closed to them that they scarcely knew that there was an everlasting life. The truth of this is perfectly plain from the fact that they failed to acknowledge the Lord, even though the whole of Sacred Scripture was a prophecy about Him and foretold His coming. The only reason why they rejected Him was that He taught them about a kingdom in heaven, not one on earth. For they wanted a Messiah who would make them superior to all peoples throughout the world, not one who would provide for their eternal salvation. </p>

205. The idolatries of nations in ancient times originated in a knowledge of correspondences, since all things visible on earth correspond; thus not only trees, but all kind of beasts and birds, also fishes, and all other things. The ancients, who had a knowledge of correspondences, made for themselves images corresponding to heavenly things, and took delight in them because they signified such things as belong to heaven and the church; consequently they placed these images not only in their temples but also in their houses, not for worship but to call to mind the heavenly things they signified. So in Egypt and elsewhere there were images of calves, oxen, and serpents, also of boys, old men, and virgins; because calves and oxen signified the affections and powers of the natural man; serpents the prudence and the cunning of the sensual man; boys innocence and charity; old men wisdom, and virgins affections for truth; and so on. When the knowledge of correspondences had perished, their posterity, because these images and figures had been placed by the ancients in and near their temples, began to worship these as holy, and finally as deities. For the same reason the ancients worshiped in gardens and groves, according to the different kinds of trees in them; also on mountains and hills; for gardens and groves signified wisdom and intelligence, and each tree signified something pertaining thereto; thus the olive signified the good of love; the vine truth from that good; the cedar rational good and truth; a mountain the highest heaven; and a hill the heaven below it. That the knowledge of correspondences remained with many of the people of the East even till the advent of the Lord can be seen also in the coming of the wise men of the East to the Lord when He was born: <p>Therefore a star went before them, and they brought with them gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh (<a href="3927/matthew_2_1.htm">Matthew 2:1, 2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_2_9.htm">9-11</a>); <p>for "the star" that went before signified knowledge from heaven; "gold" signified celestial good; "frankincense" spiritual good; and "myrrh" natural good; from which three all worship proceeds. Nevertheless, with the Israelitish and Jewish nation there was no knowledge whatever of correspondences, although every thing pertaining to their worship, and all the statutes and judgments given them by Moses, and all things in the Word, were pure correspondences. This was because in heart the Jews were idolaters, and therefore such that they were not even willing to know that anything in their worship signified what is heavenly and spiritual; for they believed that all things of their worship were holy in themselves; and therefore if things heavenly and spiritual had been disclosed to them they would not only have rejected them but also have profaned them. For this reason heaven was so closed to them that they scarcely knew that there was any eternal life. The truth of this is plainly evident from the fact that they did not acknowledge the Lord, although the whole Sacred Scripture prophesied of Him and foretold His coming. They rejected Him solely for the reason that He taught them of a heavenly instead of an earthly kingdom; for they wanted a Messiah who would exalt them above all the nations in the whole world, and not a Messiah who would have regard to their eternal salvation. </p>

205. The idolatries of nations in ancient times arose from a knowledge of correspondences, because all things that appear on the earth have a correspondence, as trees, beasts, and birds of every kind, also fishes and all other things. The ancients who had a knowledge of correspondences made for themselves images corresponding to heavenly things, and they took delight in them because they signified things of heaven and the Church. These images therefore they set up, not only in their temples but also in their homes, not to worship them, but that they might remind them of the heavenly things which they signified. Thus in Egypt and elsewhere they set up in effigy calves, oxen, serpents, also children, old men and virgins; because calves and oxen signified the affections and powers of the natural man; serpents, the prudence and also the cunning of the sensual man; children, innocence and charity; old men, wisdom; and virgins, the affections of truth; and so on. When, however, the knowledge of correspondences was lost, their posterity began to worship as holy, and at length as deities, the images and likenesses set up by the ancients, because these were in and about their temples. For the same reason the ancients worshiped in gardens and in groves, according to the different kinds of trees growing in them, and also on mountains and hills; because gardens and groves signified wisdom and intelligence, and every tree something that had relation to these. Thus the olive signified the good of love, the vine, truth from that good; the cedar, rational good and truth; while a mountain signified the highest heaven, and a hill, the heaven beneath it.<p>The knowledge of correspondences remained among many eastern nations even until the Coming of the Lord. This may be seen from the story of the wise men from the East, who came to the Lord at His nativity.<p>A star went before them, and they brought with them gifts; gold, frankincense and myrrh. <a href="3927/matthew_2_1.htm">Matthew 2:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_2_9.htm">9-11</a>.<p>For the star which went before them signified knowledge from heaven; gold, celestial good; frankincense, spiritual good; and myrrh, natural good; and from these three all worship proceeds. Still there was no knowledge whatever of correspondences among the Israelitish and Jewish nation, although all the particulars of their worship, all the statutes and judgments given to them by Moses, and everything contained in the Word, were pure correspondences. The reason of this was that they were at heart idolaters, and consequently were not even willing to know that any part of their worship had a celestial and spiritual meaning. They believed that all those things were holy in themselves; if therefore the celestial and spiritual things had been revealed to them, they would not only have rejected, but would even have profaned them. For this reason heaven was so closed to them that they hardly knew that there was a life eternal. That such was the case is very evident from the fact that they did not acknowledge the Lord, although the whole Sacred Scripture prophesied concerning Him, and foretold His Coming. They rejected Him for the sole reason that He taught them about a heavenly and not about an earthly kingdom; for they desired a Messiah who should exalt them above all the nations in the world, and not one who should make their eternal salvation His chief regard. </p>

205. Quod Idololatriae Gentium Antiquis temporibus ex scientia Correspondentiarum traxerint originem, erat ex causa, quia omnia, quae apparent super Tellure, correspondent, ita non modo Arbores, sed etiam Bestiae et Aves omnis generis, tum Pisces et reliqua. Antiqui, qui in scientia Correspondentiarum fuerunt, fecerunt sibi Imagines, quae Coelestibus correspondebant, et illis delectabantur quia significabant talia, quae Coeli et Ecclesiae erant, et ideo illa non modo in suis Templis, sed etiam in suis Domibus posuerunt, non adorationis causa, sed recordationis rerum coelestium, quas significabant: inde in Aegypto et alibi fuerunt in imagine Vituli, Boves, Serpentes, tum Pueri, Senes, Virgines, quia Vituli et Boves significabant affectiones et vires Naturalis hominis, Serpentes prudentiam et quoque astutiam sensualis hominis; Pueri innocentiam et charitatem, Senes sapientiam, ac Virgines affectiones veri; et sic porro. Posteri, quando scientia Correspondentiarum obliterata est, coeperunt Imagines et Simulachra ab Antiquis posita, quia in Templis, et juxta illa, colere ut Sancta, et tandem ut Numina. Inde erat Antiquis etiam Cultus in Hortis et in Lucis secundum Arborum species; tum etiam super Montibus et Collibus; Horti enim et Luci significabant sapientiam et intelligentiam, et unaquaevis Arbor aliquid illarum, sicut Olea bonum amoris, Vitis verum ex illo bono; Cedrus bonum et verum rationale; Mons Coelum supremum, et Collis Coelum sub illo.</p>
<p>
[2] Quod scientia Correspondentiarum permanserit apud plures Orientales usque ad Adventum Domini, constare etiam potest ex Sapientibus ab Oriente, qui venerunt ad Dominum cum natus est, quare illis praeivit Stella, et illi secum tulerunt dona, Aurum, Thus et Myrrham, <a href="3927/matthew_2_1.htm">Matthaeus 2:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_2_9.htm">9-11</a>; Stella enim, quae praeivit, significabat cognitionem e Coelo, Aurum significabat bonum coeleste, Thus bonum spirituale, et Myrrha bonum naturale, ex quibus tribus est omnis Cultus. Sed usque Scientia Correspondentiarum prorsus nulla fuit apud Gentem Israeliticam et Judaicam, tametsi omnia Cultus eorum et omnia Statuta et Judicia illis per Mosen data, et omnia Verbi, erant merae Correspondentiae; causa fuit, quia illi corde Idololatrae erant, et inde tales, ut ne quidem scire vellent, quod aliquid Cultus illorum significaret Coeleste et Spirituale, credebant enim quod illa omnia essent Sancta ex se; quare si illis Coelestia et Spiritualia detecta fuissent, non modo rejecissent illa, sed etiam prophanavissent; quapropter Coelum illis ita clausum fuit, ut vix scirent quod Vita aeterna daretur; quod ita sit, manifeste patet ex eo, quod non agnoverint Dominum, tametsi universa Scriptura Sacra de Ipso prophetavit, et Adventum Ipsius praedixit; rejecerunt Ipsum propter illam solam causam, quia illos de Regno coelesti, et non de Regno terrestri docuit, voluerunt enim Messiam, qui illos super omnes Gentes in universo Mundo exaltaret, et non aliquem Messiam, qui saluti aeternae eorum consuleret. </p>
