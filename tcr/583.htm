583. Regeneration Progresses Analogously to the Way We Are Conceived, Carried in the Womb, Born, and Brought Up
<p>For human beings, there is a constant correspondence between the stages a person goes through physically and the stages a person goes through spiritually, or developments in the body and developments in the spirit. The reason is that at the level of our souls we are born spiritual, but we are clothed with earthly material that constitutes our physical body. When our physical body is laid aside, our soul, which has its own spiritual body, enters a world in which all things are spiritual. There we associate with other spiritual beings like ourselves.
<p>Our spiritual body has to be formed within our physical body. The spiritual body is made out of truth and goodness that flow into us from the Lord through the spiritual world. We find a home within ourselves for that goodness and truth in things that parallel them in the physical world, which are called civic and moral forms of goodness and truth. This makes clear, then, the nature of the process that forms our spiritual body.
<p>Since there is a constant correspondence within human beings between the stages we go through physically and the stages we go through spiritually, it follows that we go through something analogous to being conceived, carried in the womb, born, and brought up.
<p>This explains why the statements in the Word that relate to physical birth symbolize aspects of our spiritual birth that have to do with goodness and truth. In fact, every earthly reference in the literal sense of the Word embodies, contains, and symbolizes something spiritual. (In the chapter on Sacred Scripture [189-281] it is fully demonstrated that there is a spiritual meaning within each and every detail of the literal sense of the Word.)
</p>
<p>
[2] The earthly references to birth in the Word inwardly refer to our spiritual birth, as anyone can see from the following passages:
<p>We have conceived; we have gone into labor. We appeared to give birth, yet we have not accomplished salvation. (<a href="3927/isaiah_26_18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a>)
<p>You are having birth pangs, O earth, in the presence of the Lord. (<a href="3927/psalms_114_7.htm">Psalms 114:7</a>)
<p>Will the earth give birth in a single day? Will I break [waters] but not cause delivery? Will I cause delivery and then close [the womb]? (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_7.htm">Isaiah 66:7-9</a>)
<p>Sin is having birth pangs and No will be split open. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_30_16.htm">Ezekiel 30:16</a>)
<p>Pains like those of a woman in labor will come upon Ephraim. He is an unwise son, because he does not remain long in the womb for children. (<a href="3927/hosea_13_12.htm">Hosea 13:12-13</a>)
<p>Many similar passages occur elsewhere.
<p>Since physical birth in the Word symbolizes spiritual birth, and spiritual birth comes from the Lord, he is called our Maker and the one who delivered us from the womb, as is clear from the following passages.
<p>Jehovah, who made you and formed you in the womb . . . (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_2.htm">Isaiah 44:2</a>)
<p>You delivered me from the womb. (<a href="3927/psalms_22_9.htm">Psalms 22:9</a>)
<p>On you I was laid from the womb. You delivered me from my mother's belly. (<a href="3927/psalms_71_6.htm">Psalms 71:6</a>)
<p>Listen to me, you whom I carried from the womb, whom I bore from the womb. (<a href="3927/isaiah_46_3.htm">Isaiah 46:3</a>)
<p>There are other such passages as well.
<p>This is why the Lord is called the Father, as in <a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">63:16</a>; <a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_8.htm">14:8-9</a>. This is why people who have received things that are good and true from the Lord are called "children of God" and "those who are born of God," and why they are said to be siblings to each other (<a href="3927/matthew_23_8.htm">Matthew 23:8</a>). This is also why the church is referred to as a mother (<a href="3927/hosea_2_2.htm">Hosea 2:2</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_2_5.htm">5</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_45.htm">Ezekiel 16:45</a>). </p>

583. IV. The process of regeneration is on the model of a person's conception, gestation in the womb, birth and upbringing.<p>The natural and spiritual events in a person's life, that is, what happens to his body and what to his spirit, are so ordered as permanently to correspond. The reason is that a person is by birth spiritual as regards his soul, and he is clothed with a natural form which is constituted by his material body. When therefore this is laid aside, his soul, clothed in his spiritual body, comes into the world where all things are spiritual, and there associates with people like him. Now the spiritual body has to be formed in the material one, a process accomplished by the inflow of truths and various kinds of good from the Lord through the spiritual world. These are inwardly received by the person in such things belonging to the natural world as are called civil and moral; so it is evident how the process of formation takes place. Because, as already said, there is a permanent correspondence between the natural and spiritual events in a person's life, it follows that this process must resemble his conception, gestation in the womb, birth and upbringing. That is why natural births in the Word mean spiritual births, that is, the birth of good and truth. For whatever stands in the literal or natural sense of the Word, enfolds and stands for something spiritual. I demonstrated fully in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture that every detail of the literal sense of the Word contains a spiritual sense.</p>
<p>
[2] The natural births mentioned in the Word refer to spiritual births, as is evident from the following passages.<p>We have conceived, we have given birth, we have as it were brought forth [wind], we have not done what is sound, <a href="3927/isaiah_26_18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a>.<p>At the presence of the Lord you give birth <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
, O earth, <a href="3927/psalms_114_7.htm">Psalms 114:7</a>.<p>Has the earth given birth in one day? Shall I break and not bring to birth, and cause to give birth but close <sup "fn10_2">2</sup>
up the womb? <a href="3927/isaiah_66_7.htm">Isaiah 66:7-10</a>. Sin gives birth and No shall be on the point of being breached, <a href="3927/ezekiel_30_16.htm">Ezekiel 30:16</a>.<p>The pangs of childbirth shall come upon Ephraim. He is an unwise child, because at the right time he does not stand in the womb of sons, <a href="3927/hosea_13_12.htm">Hosea 13:12-13</a>.<p>There are many other similar passages. Since natural births in the Word mean spiritual births, and these are the Lord's work, He is called He who forms and brings out of the womb. This is clear from these passages among others:<p>Jehovah your maker and who forms you from the womb, <a href="3927/isaiah_44_2.htm">Isaiah 44:2</a>.<p>He who brings me from the womb, <a href="3927/psalms_22_9.htm">Psalms 22:9</a>.<p>I have been placed upon you from the womb, from my mother's inmost parts it was you who brought me forth, <a href="3927/psalms_71_6.htm">Psalms 71:6</a>.<p>Pay attention to me, you who were carried by the belly, borne by the womb, <a href="3927/isaiah_46_3.htm">Isaiah 46:3</a>.<p>This is why the Lord is called 'Father' (as at <a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">63:16</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_8.htm">14:8-9</a>), and those who are in possession of good and truth from Him are called 'sons', 'born of God' and 'brothers' among themselves (<a href="3927/matthew_23_8.htm">Matthew 23:8-9</a>). It is also why the church is called 'mother' (<a href="3927/hosea_2_2.htm">Hosea 2:2</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_2_5.htm">5</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_45.htm">Ezekiel 16:45</a>).<p>

583. IV. REGENERATION IS EFFECTED IN A MANNER ANALOGOUS TO THAT IN WHICH MAN IS CONCEIVED, CARRIED IN THE WOMB, BORN AND EDUCATED. <p>In man there is a perpetual correspondence between what takes place naturally and what takes place spiritually, or between what takes place in his body and what takes place in his spirit. This is because man as to his soul is born spiritual, and is clothed with what is natural, which forms his material body. Therefore when this body is laid aside, his soul, clothed with a spiritual body, enters a world where all things are spiritual, and is there affiliated with its like. Since then, the spiritual body must be formed in a material body, and is formed by means of truths and goods which flow in from the Lord through the spiritual world, and are inwardly received by man in such things in him as are from the natural world, which are called civil and moral, the way in which its formation is effected is evident; and since, as before said, there is in man a constant correspondence between what takes place naturally and what takes place spiritually, it follows that this formation is like conception, gestation, birth, and education. It is for this reason that natural births in the Word mean spiritual births, which are births of good and truth; for whatever is mentioned in the sense of the letter of the Word, which is natural, involves and signifies what is spiritual. That in each and all things of the sense of the letter of the Word there is a spiritual sense is fully shown in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture. That the natural births mentioned in the Word involve spiritual births is very obvious from the following passages: <p>We have conceived, we have travailed, we have as it were brought forth; we have not wrought salvation (<a href="3927/isaiah_26_18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a>). <p>At the presence of the Lord the earth bringeth forth (<a href="3927/psalms_114_7.htm">Psalms 114:7</a>). <p>Hath the earth travailed for one day? Shall I break forth and not bring forth? Shall I cause to bring forth, and shut up? (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_7.htm">Isaiah 66:7-10</a>). <p>Sin shall travail, and No shall be rent asunder (<a href="3927/ezekiel_30_16.htm">Ezekiel 30:16</a>). <p>The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon Ephraim; he is a son not wise, because he doth not stay his time in the womb of sons (<a href="3927/hosea_13_12.htm">Hosea 13:12, 13</a>). (So also in many other places.) <p>As natural generations in the Word signify spiritual generations, and these are from the Lord, He is called the Maker and the former from the womb, as appears from the following: <p>Jehovah thy Maker and thy Former from the womb (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_2.htm">Isaiah 44:2</a>). <p>Thou art He that took me out of the womb (<a href="3927/psalms_22_9.htm">Psalms 22:9</a>). <p>Upon Thee have I been laid from the womb; Thou art He that took me out of my mother's bowels (<a href="3927/psalms_71_6.htm">Psalms 71:6</a>). <p>Attend unto me, carried from the womb, borne from the matrix (<a href="3927/isaiah_46_3.htm">Isaiah 46:3</a>). (Besides other passages.) <p>For this reason the Lord is called, <p>Father (as in <a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">63:16</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_8.htm">14:8, 9</a>). <p>And those who are in goods and truths from Him are called, <p>Sons, and born of God, and brethren to each other (<a href="3927/matthew_23_8.htm">Matthew 23:8, 9</a>). <p>And again the church is called, <p>Mother (<a href="3927/hosea_2_2.htm">Hosea 2:2</a>, 5(<a href="3927/hosea_2_5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_45.htm">Ezekiel 16:45</a>). </p>

583. IV. REGENERATION TAKES PLACE IN A MANNER ANALOGOUS TO THAT IN WHICH MAN IS CONCEIVED, CARRIED IN THE WOMB, BORN AND EDUCATED.<p>In man there is a continuous correspondence between those things that take place naturally and those that take place spiritually, or between what is done in the body and what is done in the spirit. This is because man is born spiritual as to his soul, and is clothed with what is natural, which forms his material body; and when this is laid aside, his soul, clothed with a spiritual body, enters into a world where all things are spiritual, and is there associated with its like. Now the spiritual body must be formed in the material body, and is formed by means of truths and goods which, flowing in from the Lord through the spiritual world, are received by man interiorly in such things in him as are from the natural world, which are called civil and moral. It is evident, therefore, what must be the nature of its formation. And since, as was just stated, there is in man a continuous correspondence between what takes place naturally and what takes place spiritually, it follows that the stages of spiritual regeneration answer to those of natural conception, gestation, birth and education. It is for this reason that in the Word natural births mean spiritual births, which have relation to good and truth; for whatever occurs in the sense of the Letter of the Word, which is the natural sense, involves and signifies something spiritual. In the chapter on The Sacred Scripture it was fully proved that in every part of the sense of the Letter of the Word there is a spiritual sense.<p>That the natural births mentioned in the Word involve spiritual births is plain from the following passages:<p>"We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth... We have not wrought any deliverance" <a href="3927/isaiah_26_18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a>.<p>"At the presence of the Lord the earth travaileth" (A.V., Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord). <a href="3927/psalms_114_7.htm">Psalms 114:7</a>.<p>"Hath the earth brought forth in one day?... Shall I break and not beget?... Shall I cause to bring forth, and not have shut up?" (A.V., Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day?... Shall I bring to the birth, and not beget?... Shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb?) <a href="3927/isaiah_66_7.htm">Isaiah 66:7-10</a>.<p>"Sin travaileth, and No shall be for the breaking forth" (A.V., Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be rent asunder). <a href="3927/ezekiel_30_16.htm">Ezekiel 30:16</a>.<p>"The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon Ephraim (A.V., him); he is an unwise son; for he doth not stay his time in the womb of sons" <a href="3927/hosea_13_12.htm">Hosea 13:12-13</a>.<p>There are many other similar passages. Since natural births, when mentioned in the Word, signify spiritual births, and these are from the Lord, He is called the Former, and He that bringeth forth from the womb, as is evident from the following passages:<p>"JEHOVAH, thy Maker, and Former from the womb" (A.V., the Lord that made thee, and formed thee from the womb). <a href="3927/isaiah_44_2.htm">Isaiah 44:2</a>.<p>"He that took me out from the womb" <a href="3927/psalms_22_9.htm">Psalms 22:9</a>.<p>"By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art He that took me out of my mother's bowels" <a href="3927/psalms_71_6.htm">Psalms 71:6</a>.<p>"Hearken unto me... which are borne... from the belly, which are carried from the womb" <a href="3927/isaiah_46_3.htm">Isaiah 46:3</a>; and from other passages.<p>The Lord is, therefore, called Father,<p>as in <a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">63:16</a>; <a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_8.htm">14:8-9</a>;<p>and those who are in goods and truths from Him are called "sons and born of God, and brethren one among another," <a href="3927/matthew_23_8.htm">Matthew 23:8</a>;<p>and the Church is called mother, <a href="3927/hosea_2_2.htm">Hosea 2:2</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_2_5.htm">5</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_45.htm">Ezekiel 16:45</a>. </p>

Quod Regeneratio fiat ad instar sicut homo concipitur, gestatur in utero, nascitur, et educatur.<p>Apud hominem est perpetua correspondentia inter illa quae naturaliter fiunt, et quae spiritualiter, seu quae fiunt corpore, et quae spiritu; causa est, quia homo natus est spiritualis quoad animam, et induitur naturali quod facit ejus materiale Corpus; quare cum hoc deponitur, anima ejus induta spirituali corpore, in Mundum, in quo omnia spiritualia sunt, venit, et ibi consociatur sui similibus. Nunc quia Spirituale corpus formandum est in materiali corpore, ac formatur per vera et bona, quae influunt a Domino per spiritualem Mundum, ac recipiuntur ab homine intus in talibus ejus quae sunt e naturali Mundo, quae vocantur civilia et moralia, patet qualiter formatio ejus fit; et quia, ut dictum, est perpetua correspondentia apud hominem inter illa quae naturaliter fiunt et quae spiritualiter, consequitur quod sit sicut conceptio, gestatio in utero, partus et educatio. Ex illa causa est, quod in Verbo per Nativitates naturales intelligantur Nativitates spirituales, quae sunt boni et veri, nam quicquid in sensu literae Verbi, qui est naturalis, exstat, involvit et significat spirituale: quod in omnibus et singulis sensus literae Verbi sit Sensus spiritualis, in Capite de SCRIPTURA SACRA, plene ostensum est.</p>

[2] Quod Nativitates naturales in Verbo nominatae involvant Nativitates spirituales, manifeste constat ex his ibi, "Concepimus, parturivimus, quasi peperimus, salutes non fecimus, <a href="3927/isaiah_26_18.htm">Esaias 26:18</a>. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>

Quoniam naturales generationes significant spirituales in Verbo, et hae sunt a Domino, inde Ipse vocatur Formator et Eductor ab utero, quod patet ex his, "Jehovah Factor tuus, et Formator ab utero, <a href="3927/isaiah_44_2.htm">Esaias 44:2</a>.
