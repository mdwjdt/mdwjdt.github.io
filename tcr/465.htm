<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>465</b>.上述内容，就是当今教会关于人在属灵和属世事上的自由选择、以及原罪方面的律例、信条和教规。在此将它们罗列出来，是为了使新教会关于这方面的律例、信条和教规可以看得更清楚。因为通过两种标准的对照，真理会显现在光明中，就象一幅画中，若在一张标致的面孔旁边画上一张丑陋的脸，然后同时观赏它们，那么这一个的美和另一个的丑就会一目了然。以下是新教会的教规。</p>

465. These then are the precepts, dogmas, and tenets of the church of today regarding human free choice in spiritual and earthly matters and regarding original sin. The reason I have presented these here is so that the precepts, dogmas, and tenets of the new church on these topics may appear more clearly. Truth appears in the light when two forms are set side by side like this, just as sometimes in paintings a misshapen face is placed next to an attractive one; since we can see the faces at the same time, the beauty of the one and the ugliness of the other stand out clearly before the eye. The tenets of the new church are as follows. </p>

465. These are the precepts, dogmas and prescriptions of the present-day church about man's free will in spiritual and natural matters, as well as about original sin. These have been cited so as to show up more clearly the precepts, dogmas and prescriptions on these subjects of the new church, Setting the two forms alongside like this puts their truth in the light, a practice followed by painters, who put an ugly face next to a beautiful one, so that seeing them together clearly shows the eye the beauty of the one and the ugliness of the other. The prescriptions of the new church are the following. </p>

465. These are the precepts, dogmas, and canons of the present church respecting man's freedom of choice in spiritual and in natural things, as also respecting original sin. They are here presented in order that the precepts, dogmas, and canons of the New Church on these subjects may be seen more clearly; for from the two formulas so contrasted the truth appears in the light, just as when an ugly face is placed beside a handsome one in a picture, the two being seen at the same time, the beauty of one and the ugliness of the other are clearly displayed to the eye. The canons of the New Church here follow. </p>

465. These are the precepts, tenets and decrees of the present Church concerning man's free will in spiritual and in natural things, and also concerning original sin. They have been adduced in order that the precepts, tenets and decrees of the New Church concerning these subjects may be more clearly seen. For when two formularies are thus placed side by side the truth appears in clear light; just as in the case of pictures, when an ugly face is placed by the side of a handsome one and they are viewed together, the beauty of the one and the ugliness of the other are clearly exhibited to the eye. The following are the precepts of the New Church on this subject. </p>

465. Haec sunt hodiernae Ecclesiae praecepta, dogmata et sancita de Libero Arbitrio hominis in spiritualibus et in naturalibus, ut et de Peccato originali; haec adducta sunt ob finem ut evidentius appareant praecepta, dogmata et sancita Novae Ecclesiae de illis, nam ex binis sic appositis formis apparet veritas in luce, sicut fit in Picturis, in quibus Facies deformis a latere apponitur Faciei formosae, ex quibus simul visus formositas unius et deformitas alterius coram oculo clare exstant. Sancita Novae Ecclesiae sunt haec quae sequuntur. </p>
