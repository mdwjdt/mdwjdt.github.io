<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>156</b>.（6）人的灵就是他的心智，以及它所发出的一切。具体来说，人的灵无非是他的心智。死后活着的就是心智，那时它被称为灵。他若是善的，就是天使灵，随后成为天使；若是恶的，就是撒旦灵，随后成为撒旦。人的心智就是他的内在人，也就是真正的人，居于肉体所构成的外在人中。所以，当肉体通过死亡脱去后，内在人完全就是人的样式。因此，那些以为人的心智仅居于头脑中的人是错的。<br />头脑中只有心智的初始元素，人通过理解力所思的一切和通过意愿所行的一切皆从这些初始元素发出。心智的衍生元素则存在于身体中，它们用来形成感觉和活动。心智由于总是附着于身体结构，故会赋予它们感觉和活动，还给它们造成一种感觉，即身体靠自己思考和行动。但是，凡智者都知道，后者（即身体靠自己思考和行动）是一个错觉。既然人的灵通过理解力思考，通过意愿行动，既然身体无法自主行动，只能通过灵，那么可知，人的灵就是他的聪明（或才智intelligence）和爱的情感，以及由这二者所发出和运行的一切。<br />“人的灵”是指诸如属乎心智之类的事物。这一点从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来：<br />比撒列被智慧、聪明、知识的灵充满。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.3.htm">出埃及记31:3</a>）<br />尼布甲尼撒称但以理里面有美好的灵性，又有知识、聪明和智慧。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但5.12.htm">但以理书5:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但5.14.htm">14</a>）<br />约书亚被智慧的灵充满。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/申34.9.htm">申命记34:9</a>）<br />你们要自做一个新心和新灵。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结18.31.htm">以西结书18:31</a>）<br />灵里贫穷的人有福了，因为天国是他们的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.3.htm">马太福音5:3</a>）<br />我住在破碎、谦卑的灵里，要使谦卑人的灵苏醒。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛57.15.htm">以赛亚书57:15</a>）<br />神所要的祭，就是破碎的灵。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗51.17.htm">诗篇51:17</a>）<br />我要赐赞美衣代替忧伤之灵。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.3.htm">以赛亚书61:3</a>）<br />“灵”还表堕落、邪恶心智的产物，如下列经文所证明的：<br />祂对愚顽的先知说，他们随从自己的灵。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.3.htm">以西结书13:3</a>）<br />你们要怀的是糠秕，要生的是碎秸，至于你们的灵，火必吞灭你们。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.11.htm">以赛亚书33:11</a>）<br />在灵里游荡，口吐谎言之人。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥2.11.htm">弥迦书2:11</a>）<br />其灵对神不忠贞的一代。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.8.htm">诗篇78:8</a>）<br />邪恶的灵。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.12.htm">何西阿书4:12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/何5.4.htm">5:4</a>）<br />一切心都必消化，一切灵都必衰微。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结21.7.htm">以西结书21:7</a>）<br />你们的灵所起之意万不能成就。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.32.htm">以西结书20:32</a>）<br />凡灵里没有诡诈的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗32.2.htm">诗篇32:2</a>）<br />法老的灵不安。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创41.8.htm">创世记41:8</a>）<br />尼布甲尼撒的灵烦乱。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.3.htm">但以理书2:3</a>）<br />这些以及其它许多经文清楚证实，“灵”表人的心智及其所属之物。</p>

156. (6)人的靈是他的思想,以及諸如此類源自思想的。
<p>人的"靈"其實就是人的思想, 就是人死後繼續活著的, 被稱為"靈"。如果這靈是善的, 就稱為善靈,以後成為天人。如果是惡的, 就被稱為恶靈,以後成為魔鬼或撒旦。每個人的思想就是人的內在人, 是真我; 住在构成肉身的外在人之中。當肉身死後被拋棄時, 這內在人就是完全人的樣式。
<p>認為人的思想只是存於他的頭腦之中, 這個觀念是錯誤的。頭腦只是思想所處的初始结构。一切智力所思考的,意志所想做的, 首先發源於這初始结构。而思想在身體的其它部分中, 是處在這初始结构的延伸之中, 並被設計去讓身體各部位可以感覺與活動。因為思想在內部與身體構造相連, 賦予身體各部位去感覺和運動, 同時讓身體認為是自身在思考與行動。但有識之士应当知道, 事實並非如此。
<p>由於我們的靈以認知來思考,憑意志來行動, 而我們的身體並非憑自己去思考與行動,而是靠我們靈的幫助。因而得出, 我們的"靈"其實就是指我們的認知和意志, 我們所言所行都來自於此。
<p>聖言中有很多經文可以證明, 我們的"靈"表示我們的思想以及相關事物。當我僅僅引用少許經文時, 任何人都能看出, 這確實是"靈"表示的含義。以下就是其中少許:
<p>比撒列被智慧,聰明和知識的靈充滿(<a href="3927/exodus_31_3.htm">出埃及記31:3</a>)。尼布甲尼撒說但以理的裡面有知識,聰明和智慧之"美好的靈"(<a href="3927/daniel_5_12.htm">但以理書5:12</a>)。約書亞被智慧之靈充滿(<a href="3927/deuteronomy_34_9.htm">申命記34:9</a>)。為你自己造新心和新靈(<a href="3927/ezekiel_18_31.htm">以西結書18:31</a>)。靈裡貧窮的人有福了, 因為天國正是由這些人組成的(<a href="3927/matthew_5_3.htm">馬太福音5:3</a>)。我與壓碎的和謙卑的靈同住, 要使謙卑的靈蘇醒過來(<a href="3927/isaiah_57_15.htm">以賽亞書57:15</a>)。破碎的靈是上帝的祭物(<a href="3927/psalms_51_17.htm">詩篇51:17</a>)。以讚美之衣代表憂傷之靈(<a href="3927/isaiah_61_3.htm">以賽亞書61:3</a>)。
<p>"靈"也用來表示墮落的或不義的思想, 如下列經文:
<p>祂對愚頑的先知說, 就是隨從自己的靈說話的(<a href="3927/ezekiel_13_3.htm">以西結書13:3</a>)。你們孕懷著乾草, 產了碎秸; 至於你們的靈, 火必吞滅你們(<a href="3927/isaiah_33_11.htm">以賽亞書33:11</a>)。在靈裡遊蕩, 口吐謊言之人(<a href="3927/micah_2_11.htm">彌迦書2:11</a>)。這代人的靈向上帝不堅定(<a href="3927/psalms_78_8.htm">詩篇78:8</a>)。淫蕩的靈(<a href="3927/hosea_4_12.htm">何西阿書4:12</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_5_4.htm">5:4</a>)。所有的心消化, 全部的靈被壓制(<a href="3927/ezekiel_21_7.htm">以西結書21:7</a>)。你靈所起之意不能成就(<a href="3927/ezekiel_20_32.htm">以西結書20:32</a>)。倘若他們的靈裡沒有詭詐(<a href="3927/psalms_32_2.htm">詩篇32:2</a>)。法老的靈不安(<a href="3927/genesis_41_8.htm">創世記41:8</a>)。尼布甲尼撒的靈煩亂(<a href="3927/daniel_2_3.htm">但以理書2:3</a>)。
<p>從這些以及其他許多地方, 都可以明顯看出, "靈"指人的思想及其特性。 </p>

156. 6. Our spirits are our minds and whatever comes from them. Our "spirit" really means nothing else but our mind. Our mind is what lives on after death. It is then called a spirit. If it is good, it is called an angelic spirit and later on an angel. If it is evil, it is called a satanic spirit and later on a satan. For each one of us, our mind is our inner self, our true self. It lives inside our outer self that constitutes our body. When our body is cast aside, which death does for us, we are in a complete human form.
<p>People are wrong, then, to believe that our mind exists only in our head. Our mind is present in our head only in its primary structures. Everything that we think with our intellect and do from our will first emanates from these primary structures. In the rest of our body, our mind is present in extensions of these primary structures that have been designed to allow us sensation and action. Because our mind is inwardly connected to the parts of our body, our mind supplies those parts with sensation and motion and also inspires awareness as if our body thought and acted on its own, although every wise person knows this is not how it is.
<p>Now, because our spirit thinks with its intellect and acts with its will, and our body thinks and acts not on its own but with the help of our spirit, it follows that our "spirit" means our intelligence and our type of love, as well as whatever emanates from our love and intelligence and has an effect.
<p>Many passages in the Word make clear that our "spirit" means the nature of our mind. When I quote only a few of these passages, anyone will be able to see that this is exactly what "spirit" means. The following are just a few of the many:
<p>And Bezaleel was filled with the spirit of wisdom, intelligence, and knowledge. (<a href="3927/exodus_31_3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>)
<p>Nebuchadnezzar said of Daniel that there was "an excellent spirit" of knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom in him (<a href="3927/daniel_5_12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a>).
<p>Joshua was filled with the spirit of wisdom. (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_34_9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>)
<p>Make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_18_31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>)
<p>Blessed are the poor in spirit, because the kingdom of the heavens consists of such people. (<a href="3927/matthew_5_3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>)
<p>I live among people with a beaten and humble spirit so that I may revive the spirit of the lowly. (<a href="3927/isaiah_57_15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>)
<p>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. (<a href="3927/psalms_51_17.htm">Psalms 51:17</a>)
<p>I will give a cloak of praise to replace a constricted spirit. (<a href="3927/isaiah_61_3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>)
<p>And so on.
<p>"Spirit" can also mean the nature of a corrupt and unjust mind, as the following passages make clear:
<p>He spoke to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_13_3.htm">Ezekiel 13:3</a>)
<p>Conceive garbage, give birth to stubble; in your spirit, fire will consume you. (<a href="3927/isaiah_33_11.htm">Isaiah 33:11</a>)
<p>A man who is a wanderer in his spirit and who babbles a lie. (<a href="3927/micah_2_11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>)
<p>A generation whose spirit was not steadfast with God. (<a href="3927/psalms_78_8.htm">Psalms 78:8</a>)
<p>A spirit of promiscuity. (<a href="3927/hosea_5_4.htm">Hosea 5:4</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_4_12.htm">4:12</a>)
<p>To melt every heart and constrict every spirit. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_21_7.htm">Ezekiel 21:7</a>)
<p>What has come up in your spirit will never be done. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_20_32.htm">Ezekiel 20:32</a>)
<p>Provided there is no guile in their spirit. (<a href="3927/psalms_32_2.htm">Psalms 32:2</a>)
<p>The spirit of Pharaoh was disturbed. (<a href="3927/genesis_41_8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>)
<p>Likewise the spirit of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="3927/daniel_2_3.htm">Daniel 2:3</a>). These and many other passages make it obvious that our "spirit" means our mind and its characteristics. </p>

156. (vi) A PERSON'S SPIRIT IS HIS MIND, AND WHATEVER COMES FROM IT.<p>A person's spirit, regarded as an object, is nothing but his mind. It is this which lives on after death, and it is then called a spirit; if he is good, an angelic spirit and later an angel, if wicked, a satanic spirit and afterwards a Satan. Everyone's mind is his internal man, which is the real person and resides within the external man composed of his body. So when the body is cast off as the result of death, the internal man has a fully human form. Those, then, are in error who believe that a person's mind resides only in his head. There it is only in its beginnings, from which first emerge everything a person's understanding allows him to think and his will induces him to do. But in the body the mind is present in derivatives from those beginnings, and these have been so constructed as to permit sensation and action. Since it is inwardly attached to the bodily structures, it imparts to them sensation and movement, together with a feeling that the body thinks and acts of itself. Yet every intelligent person knows that this is a fallacy. Now since a person's spirit is allowed by his understanding to think and is induced by his will to act, and the body does not do so of itself but from the spirit, it follows that a person's spirit means his intelligence and the affection of his love, and everything which comes from it and acts.</p>
<p>
[2] There are numerous passages in the Word to prove that a person's spirit means such things as are to do with the mind; their mere quotation will show anyone that this is so. The following are a few among many:<p>Bezaleel was filled with the spirit of wisdom, intelligence and knowledge, <a href="3927/exodus_31_3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>.<p>Nebuchadnezzar said of Daniel that an outstanding spirit of knowledge, intelligence and wisdom was in him, <a href="3927/daniel_5_12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_5_14.htm">14</a>.<p>Joshua was filled with the spirit of wisdom, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_34_9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>.<p>Make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit, <a href="3927/ezekiel_18_31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>.<p>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens, <a href="3927/matthew_5_3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>.<p>I dwell in a broken and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, <a href="3927/isaiah_57_15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>.<p>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, <a href="3927/psalms_51_17.htm">Psalms 51:17</a>.<p>I will give a cloak of praise in place of a depressed spirit, <a href="3927/isaiah_61_3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>.<p>Spirit also stands for the products of a wrong and unjust mind, as these passages prove:<p>He said to the foolish prophets, who run after their own spirit, <a href="3927/ezekiel_13_3.htm">Ezekiel 13:3</a>.<p>Conceive chaff, bring forth stubble; as to your spirit, fire shall devour you, <a href="3927/isaiah_33_11.htm">Isaiah 33:11</a>.<p>A man who is in spirit a vagabond and utters a lie, <a href="3927/micah_2_11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>.<p>A generation whose spirit is not steadfast with God, <a href="3927/psalms_78_8.htm">Psalms 78:8</a>.<p>A spirit of whoring, <a href="3927/hosea_4_12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_5_4.htm">5:4</a>.<p>That every heart may melt and every spirit be depressed, <a href="3927/ezekiel_21_7.htm">Ezekiel 21:7</a>.<p>That which rises upon your spirit shall never be, <a href="3927/ezekiel_20_32.htm">Ezekiel 20:32</a>.<p>Provided there is no deceit in his spirit, <a href="3927/psalms_32_2.htm">Psalms 32:2</a>.<p>The spirit of Pharaoh was troubled, <a href="3927/genesis_41_8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>.<p>Likewise that of Nebuchadnezzar, <a href="3927/daniel_2_3.htm">Daniel 2:3</a>.<p>These and very many other passages plainly establish that spirit means a person's mind and what is to do with it. </p>

156. (6) The spirit of man is his mind and whatever proceeds from it. In the concrete, man's spirit means simply his mind; for this it is that lives after death, and it is then called a spirit-if good, an angelic spirit and afterwards an angel, if evil, a satanic spirit and afterwards a satan. The mind of everyone is his internal man, which is actually the man, and resides within the external man which constitutes his body; consequently when the body is cast off, which is effected by its death, the internal is in a complete human form. Therefore they err who believe that man's mind resides only in the head; it is there in principles only, from which everything that man thinks from his understanding or does from his will first proceeds; but in the body it is in derivatives, which are formed for sensation and action. And because the mind invariably adheres to the bodily structures it imparts to them sensation and motion; and it also inspires them with a perception that the body thinks and acts of itself, although this latter is a fallacy, as every wise man knows. Since, then, the spirit of man thinks from the understanding and acts from the will, and since the body acts not from itself but from the spirit, it follows that the spirit of man means his intelligence and his love's affection and whatever goes forth and operates from these. That "the spirit of man" signifies such things as pertain to the mind is evident from many passages in the Word. That this is their meaning anyone can see as soon as they are presented. The following are a few passages from among many: <p>Bezaleel was filled with the spirit of wisdom and understanding and knowledge (<a href="3927/exodus_31_3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>). <p>Nebuchadnezzar said of Daniel that an excellent spirit of knowledge and understanding and wisdom was found in him (<a href="3927/daniel_5_11.htm">Daniel 5:11, 12</a>). <p>Joshua was full of the spirit of wisdom (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_34_9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>). <p>Make you a new heart and a new spirit (<a href="3927/ezekiel_18_31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>). <p>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens (<a href="3927/matthew_5_3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>). <p>I dwell in the contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble (<a href="3927/isaiah_57_15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>). <p>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit (<a href="3927/psalms_51_17.htm">Psalms 51:17</a>). <p>I will give the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness (<a href="3927/isaiah_61_3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>). (And elsewhere.) <p>That "the spirit" signifies also such things as pertain to a perverse and wicked mind is evident from the following: <p>He said to the foolish prophets that go away after their own spirit (<a href="3927/ezekiel_13_3.htm">Ezekiel 13:3</a>). <p>Conceive chaff, bring forth stubble; as to your spirit, fire shall devour you (<a href="3927/isaiah_33_11.htm">Isaiah 33:11</a>). <p>A man who is a wanderer in spirit and uttereth falsehood (<a href="3927/micah_2_11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>). <p>A generation whose spirit is not constant with God (<a href="3927/psalms_78_8.htm">Psalms 78:8</a>). <p>The spirit of whoredoms (<a href="3927/hosea_5_4.htm">Hosea 5:4</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_4_12.htm">4:12</a>). <p>That every heart may melt, and every spirit faint (<a href="3927/ezekiel_21_7.htm">Ezekiel 21:7</a>). <p>That which ascendeth upon your spirit shall never come to pass (<a href="3927/ezekiel_20_32.htm">Ezekiel 20:32</a>). <p>In whose spirit there is no guile (<a href="3927/psalms_32_2.htm">Psalms 32:2</a>). <p>Pharaoh's spirit was troubled (<a href="3927/genesis_41_8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>); <p>So also was Nebuchadnezzar's (<a href="3927/daniel_2_3.htm">Daniel 2:3</a>). <p>From these and numerous other passages it is clearly evident that the "spirit" signifies the mind of man and such things as pertain thereto. </p>

156. (6) A MAN'S SPIRIT IS HIS MIND, AND WHATEVER PROCEEDS FROM IT.<p>By a man's spirit, in the strict sense of the term, is meant simply his mind, for it is this which lives after death, and is then called a spirit; if good, an angelic spirit, and afterwards an angel; but if evil, a satanic spirit, and afterwards a satan. The mind of every man is the internal, or real man, and is within the external man, which constitutes its body; therefore, when the body is laid aside at death, the internal man is in a complete human form. So they are mistaken who suppose that a man's mind is only in his head. It is there only in the principles from which first proceeds everything that a man thinks from the understanding and does from the will. Moreover, it resides in the body in derivatives formed for sensation and action; and because it is inwardly connected with the bodily structures, it imparts to them sensation and motion. It also inspires a sort of perception that the body thinks and acts of itself; but every wise man knows that this is a fallacy. Now because a man's spirit thinks from the understanding and acts from the will, and because the body does not act from itself but from the spirit, it follows that a man's spirit means his intelligence and the affection of his love, and whatever proceeds and acts from them. That a man's spirit signifies such things as pertain to his mind, is obvious from many passages in the Word, which need only to be quoted to show that it is so. The following are a few taken from many.<p>Bezaleel "was filled with the spirit of wisdom, understanding and knowledge" <a href="3927/exodus_31_3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>.<p>Nebuchadnezzar testified of Daniel, that "an excellent spirit of knowledge and understanding and wisdom was in him" <a href="3927/daniel_5_12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a>.<p>"Joshua... was full of the spirit of wisdom" <a href="3927/deuteronomy_34_9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>.<p>"Make you a new heart and anew spirit" <a href="3927/ezekiel_18_31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>.<p>"Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" <a href="3927/matthew_5_3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>.<p>"I dwell... in a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble" <a href="3927/isaiah_57_15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>.<p>"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit" <a href="3927/psalms_51_17.htm">Psalms 51:17</a>.<p>I will give "the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness" <a href="3927/isaiah_61_3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>; besides other passages to the same effect.<p>That spirit also signifies such things as relate to a perverse and wicked mind is evident from these passages:<p>He said to the foolish prophets "that follow their own spirit" <a href="3927/ezekiel_13_3.htm">Ezekiel 13:3</a>.<p>"Ye shall conceive chaff; ye shall bring forth stubble: as to your spirit (A.V., breath) fire shall devour you. <a href="3927/isaiah_33_11.htm">Isaiah 33:11</a>.<p>"If a man walking in the spirit... and do lie" <a href="3927/micah_2_11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>.<p>"A generation... whose spirit was not steadfast with God" <a href="3927/psalms_78_8.htm">Psalms 78:8</a>.<p>"The spirit of whoredoms" <a href="3927/hosea_5_4.htm">Hosea 5:4</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_4_12.htm">4:12</a>.<p>"Every heart shall melt and every spirit shall faint" <a href="3927/ezekiel_21_7.htm">Ezekiel 21:7</a>.<p>"That which cometh into your spirit (A.V., mind), shall not be at all" <a href="3927/ezekiel_20_32.htm">Ezekiel 20:32</a>.<p>"And in whose spirit there is no guile" <a href="3927/psalms_32_2.htm">Psalms 32:2</a>.<p>The spirit of Pharaoh was troubled, <a href="3927/genesis_41_8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>.<p>and also the spirit of Nebuchadnezzar. <a href="3927/daniel_2_2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>.<p>From these and many other passages it is clearly manifest that the spirit signifies the mind of man, and whatever belongs to it. </p>

156. VI. QUOD SPIRITUS HOMINIS SIT EJUS MENS, ET QUICQUID EX ILLO PROCEDIT. Per Spiritum hominis in concreto non aliud intelligitur quam Mens ejus, haec enim est quae vivit post mortem, et tunc vocatur spiritus, si bonus, Spiritus angelicus et postea angelus, si malus, Spiritus satanicus, et postea satanas. Mens cujusvis hominis est Internus ejus homo, qui actualiter est homo, et intus in Externo homine, qui facit corpus ejus, quare dum rejicitur corpus, quod fit per mortem, est in plena forma humana. Errant itaque, qui credunt quod Mens hominis modo sit in Capite; ibi solum est in principiis, ex quibus primum exit omne quod homo ex intellectu cogitat et ex voluntate agit; in corpore autem est in principiatis, formatis ad sentiendum et agendum; et quia intus adhaeret corporeis, infert illis sensum et motum, et quoque inspirat perceptionem, sicut corpus cogitet et agat ex se, sed quod hoc sit fallacia, omnis sapiens novit. Nunc quia spiritus hominis ex intellectu cogitat et ex voluntate agit, et corpus non ex se sed ex illo, sequitur quod per spiritum hominis intelligatur ejus intelligentia et amoris affectio, et quicquid ex illis procedit et operatur.</p>
<p>
[2] Quod spiritus hominis talia quae mentis sunt, significet, constat ex multis locis in Verbo, quae dum modo adducuntur, a quovis videri potest, quod non aliud sit: <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
ex multis sint haec pauca, Bezaleel est <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
impletus spiritu sapientiae, <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
intelligentiae et scientiae, <a href="3927/exodus_31_3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>. Nebuchadnezar de Daniele, quod spiritus excellens, scientiae, intelligentiae et sapientiae esset in eo, <a href="3927/daniel_5_12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a>. <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>

Dabo pallium laudis loco spiritus contracti, <a href="3927/isaiah_61_3.htm">Esaias 61:3</a>, praeter alibi; Quod spiritus significet talia quae Mentis perversae et iniquae sunt, constat ex his: Dixit prophetis stultis, qui abeunt post spiritum suum, <a href="3927/ezekiel_13_3.htm">Ezechiel 13:3</a>. Concipite quisquilias, parite stipulam, quoad spiritum vestrum, ignis comedet vos, <a href="3927/isaiah_33_11.htm">Esaias 33:11</a>. Vir qui vagabundus spiritu, et mendacium effutit, <a href="3927/micah_2_11.htm">Micham 2:11</a>. <sup "fn120_6">6</sup>

Ut liquescat omne cor, et contrahatur omnis spiritus, <a href="3927/ezekiel_21_12.htm">Ezechiel 21:12</a>. <sup "fn120_8">8</sup>
Quod ascendit super spiritum vestrum, non fiet unquam, <a href="3927/ezekiel_20_32.htm">Ezechiel 20:32</a>. <sup "fn120_9">9</sup>
Modo non in spiritu ejus dolus, <a href="3927/psalms_32_2.htm">Psalm 32:2</a>. Spiritus Pharaonis turbatus est, <a href="3927/genesis_41_8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>, similiter Nebuchadnezaris, <a href="3927/daniel_2_3.htm">Daniel 2:3</a>. Ex his et perpluribus aliis locis manifeste constat, quod spiritus significet mentem hominis, et talia quae Mentis sunt.<p>
