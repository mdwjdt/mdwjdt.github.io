<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>379</b>. ⑴正信只有一个，就是信主神救主耶稣基督，是那些信祂是神的儿子，天地之神，与父为一之人所持守的。正信只有一个，因为信是真理，真理无法被粉碎和切割，以致于一部分朝左、一部分朝右，而仍保留自己的真理。总的来说，信由无数的真理构成，因为它是真理的集合。然而，这无数真理仿佛构成一个身体，身体里面有形成其各部位的真理。有的形成附于胸腔的部位，如手臂和手掌；有的形成附于臀部的部位，如双脚和脚底；而更内在的真理则形成头，从它们发出的真理首先形成面部感官。更内在的真理形成头的原因在于，更内在等同于更高；因为在灵界，凡更内在的，也是更高的。那里的三层天堂就是这样。这具身体的灵魂和生命及其各部位就是主神救主。这就是为何保罗称教会为“基督的身体”，属教会的人则照各自仁与信的状态构成它的各个部位。保罗还以这些话教导正信只有一个：<br />身体只有一个，圣灵只有一个，一主，一信，一洗，一神。为要成全圣徒，各尽其职，建立基督的身体，直等到我们众人在信上同归于一，认识神的儿子，得以长大成人，满有基督长成的身量。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/弗4.4.htm">以弗所书4:4</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/弗4.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/弗4.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/弗4.13.htm">13</a>）<br />前面已充分说明，唯一的正信就是信主神救主耶稣基督（337－339节）。但只有那些信主是神儿子的人才拥有正信，因为他们相信主是神，信若非信神，根本就不是信。这是进入并形成信的一切真理的首要信条，这一点可从主对彼得所说的话明显看出来，当时彼得说：<br />祢是基督，永生神的儿子。耶稣说，西门，你是有福的；我告诉你，我要把我的教会建造在这磐石上，地狱之门不能胜过它。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.16.htm">马太福音16:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.18.htm">18</a>）<br />此处的磐石和圣言其它地方的一样，表在圣真方面的主，也表从主接受的圣真。这真理是最一流的真理，如同基督身体头戴的王冠和手持的权杖。这一点还可从主的话明显看出来：<br />凡认耶稣为神儿子的，神就住在他里面，他也住在神里面。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约壹4.15.htm">约翰一书4:15</a>）<br />拥有独一正信的标志除此之外还有一个，就是信主是天地之神。这一标志既可从前一点，即主是神儿子推知，还可从以下经文推知：<br />神本性一切的丰盛都住在祂里面。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/西2.9.htm">歌罗西书2:9</a>）<br />祂是天地之神。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">马太福音28:18</a>）<br />凡是父所有的，都是祂的。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.35.htm">约翰福音3:35</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.15.htm">16:15</a>）<br />那些信靠主的人内心都拥有对祂的信，因而拥有独一的正信。对此的第三个标志就是，他们相信主与父神为一。<br />前面有关主和救赎那一章已充分说明，主与父神为一，就是以人身显现的父自己。这一点从主自己的话明显看出来：<br />祂与父为一。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.30.htm">约翰福音10:30</a>）<br />父在祂里面，祂在父里面。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.38.htm">约翰福音10:38</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.10.htm">14:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>）<br />祂对门徒们说，从今以后，他们看见并已认识父，祂看着腓力说，他看见并认识了父（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.7.htm">约翰福音14:7</a>等）。<br />这三点是人们拥有对主的信，因而是拥有独一正信的显着标志。其原因在于，并非所有靠近主的人都拥有对祂的信；因为正信既是内在的，同时也是外在的。人若拥有信的这三样宝物，就拥有了信的内在和外在，它不仅成为他们心里的宝库，还成为他们口中的珠宝。而那些既不承认主是天地之神，也不承认祂与父为一之人则截然不同。这些人内心还认为其它神明也拥有类似权柄，但这权柄是通过圣子行使的，而圣子要么被视为一个代理，要么被视为由于救赎而配统治祂所救之人的那一位。然而，这些人因着分裂神的一体而粉碎了正信；正信被粉碎后，就不再是信了，只不过是信的幽灵。从属世的角度观之，这样的信看上去象是信的某种形像，但从属灵的角度观之，它就成了一个怪物。谁会否认正信在于信一位神，也就是天地之神，因而在于信人形的父神，即主呢？<br />对主的信就是信本身。它的这三个标志、见证和迹象就像鉴别金银的试金石；或像路边指示去往敬拜独一真神的圣殿道路的石头或路标；又像海中礁石上的灯塔，使航海者在夜里能知道自己的位置，从而知道怎么调整航线。信的第一个标志是信主是永生神的儿子，对于所有进入祂的教会之人来说，它如同晨星。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #379 </h4>
<p>
379. (1)真信只有一個, 就是信主上帝我們的拯救者耶穌基督, 這信存在於這些人之中:相信主耶穌基督是上帝的兒子, 祂是天地的上帝, 祂與父為一。
<p>真信只能是一, 因為信是真理, 真理無法被粉碎和分割,以致于一部分朝左一部分朝右,卻依舊保留其真。
<p>總體來說, 信由無數的真理構成, 是真理的聚集。然而這無數的真理以某種方式構成一個身體, 各樣的真理各歸其位。一些真理構成的部位連接胸腔, 例如手臂和手掌; 一些連接臀部, 如腿腳與腳底。更內在的真理構成頭部, 接近這些內在真理的部分構成面部的感覺器官。
<p>內在的真理構成頭部, 因為稱之為"內在", 也表示"更高"。在心靈世界, 一切更內在之事, 處更高之位。天國之三層就是此理。
<p>這個身子及其肢體的靈魂與生命就是主上帝我們的拯救者。這就是為何保羅稱教會是基督的身體, 教會的成員按照各自義與信的狀態組成身體的各部位。保羅在下面這些話中還教導只有一信:
<p>只有一個身體, 一個靈, 一主, 一信, 一洗, 一上帝。為要成全聖徒, 各盡其職, 建立基督的身體, 直等到我們眾人在信上同歸於一, 認識上帝的兒子, 得以長大成人, 滿有基督長成的身量。(<a href="3927/ephesians_4_4.htm">以弗所書4:4-6</a>, <a href="3927/ephesians_4_12.htm">12-13</a>)。
<p>[2]至於這唯一的真信在於信主上帝我們的拯救者耶穌基督, 在之前(<a href="337.htm">337-339</a>)已充分說明。
<p>然而, 為何相信主耶穌基督是上帝的兒子之人才擁有真信？因為他們也相信祂是上帝。如果不是信上帝, 信就不是信。
<p>進入信並形成信的一切真理中, 最首要的信念是:主是上帝之子。這可明顯從主回答彼得的話中看得出, 當時彼得說:"禰是基督, 永生上帝的兒子。"耶穌說:"西門, 你是有福的！我還告訴你, 你是彼得, 我要把我的教會建造在這磐石上; 地獄之門, 不能勝過她"(<a href="3927/matthew_16_16.htm">馬太福音16:16-18</a>)。這裡的,以及聖言其它地方所說的"磐石", 表示作為神性真理這一角色的主, 也表示從主而來的神性真理。彼得申明的, 是最首要的真理, 如同基督身體頭戴的王冠或手持的權杖。因為主說, 祂要在這磐石上建立祂的教會, 並且地獄之門不能勝過她。約翰所寫的下列話還說明了這個首要真理的屬性:凡認耶穌為上帝兒子的, 上帝就住在他裡面, 他也住在上帝裡面(<a href="3927/john_4_15.htm">約翰福音4:15</a>)。
<p>[3]人們能擁有這唯一的真信, 除了上述這個標誌, 還有另一個:相信主是天地之上帝。這個標誌從上一個得出——也就是主是上帝之子。也可從下列陳述得出:神性的一切住在祂裡面(<a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">歌羅西書2:9</a>); 祂是天地之上帝(<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">馬太福音28:18</a>); 凡是父所有的, 都是祂的(<a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">約翰福音3:35</a>; <a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">16:15</a>)。
<p>信主的人要在內心深處擁有對祂的信, 因而擁有唯一的真信。第三個跡象是:相信主與父上帝為一。在關於主與救贖那章中, 已充分說明了主與父為一, 祂就是父自己的人身顯現。也可從主自己的話明顯看出, 祂說祂與父為一(<a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">約翰福音10:30</a>)。父在祂裡面, 祂在父裡面(<a href="3927/john_10_38.htm">約翰福音10:38</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">14:10-11</a>)。祂對門徒們說, 從現在起他們看見和認識了父, 並對腓力說, 他看見和認識了父(<a href="3927/john_14_7.htm">約翰福音14:7</a>及以後)。
<p>[4]這三點為何是信主,並且是擁有這唯一真信的標誌性象徵？因為並非所有轉向接近主的人對祂都有信; 真正的信同時存於內在和外在。人若擁有信的這三件寶物, 也就擁有內在與外在之信, 不僅在內心形成, 而且表現於外。
<p>然而, 那些並不承認主是天地之上帝, 也不承認主與上帝為一的人們, 情況就不一樣了。這些人在內心還認為其它神明也有類似聖子所運行的能力, 視祂為藉著救贖從而統治所救百姓的一個代表或者某一位。但是這些人因著分裂上帝的唯一性而粉碎了真信。當真信被粉碎後, 就不再是信了, 只不過是信的幻相而已。從屬世的角度來看, 或許是信的某種形像; 然而從屬靈角度觀察, 只不過像神話中的怪物而已。
<p>誰會否認真信應當是信一位上帝, 也就是天地之獨一上帝呢？因此, 就是信父上帝的人身顯現——也就是主。
<p>[5]從這三個標誌,證明與跡象可以看出, 對主的信便是信之本, 就像鑒別金銀的測試石。它們還像安放在路邊的記號石或路標, 告訴人們去某間敬拜獨一真上帝的教堂之路。還像海邊岩石上燈塔, 讓航海者們晚上知道自己的位置, 知道如何決定行程。
<p>主為永生上帝之子, 這是真信的第一個標誌, 如同一切進入祂教會之人的晨星。 </p>

</h4>
<p>
379. (a) There is only one true faith; it is faith in the Lord God our Savior Jesus Christ. It exists in people who believe that he is the Son of God, that he is the God of heaven and earth, and that he is one with the Father. There is only one true faith, because faith is truth. Truth cannot be split or cut in half in such a way that part of it heads left and part of it heads right, and maintain its trueness.
<p>In a general sense, faith consists of countless truths. Faith is a combination of truths. Yet in a way the countless truths make one body. In the body of faith, there are truths that constitute its limbs: some make the limbs that are attached to the chest as its arms and hands; others are attached to the pelvis as its legs and feet. Inner truths constitute the head. The first truths derived from those inner truths constitute the sense organs that are in the face.
<p>Inner truths constitute the head because saying "inner" also means "higher. " In the spiritual world, all things that are deeper within are also higher. This is true of the three heavens that are there.
<p>The soul and life of this body and all its limbs is the Lord God our Savior. This is why Paul calls the church "the body of Christ" and says that people in the church constitute his limbs, depending on the state of their goodwill and faith [; ].
<p>In the following words Paul also teaches that there is only one true faith:
<p>There is one body and one spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God. He gave people the work of the ministry to build the body of Christ until we all come into a unity of faith, the knowledge of the Son of God, and a complete life to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. (<a href="3927/ephesians_4_4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>, <a href="3927/ephesians_4_12.htm">12-13</a>)
</p>
<p>
[2] As for the one only true faith being a faith in the Lord God our Savior Jesus Christ, this was fully shown above, 337, 338, 339.
<p>The true faith exists in people who believe that the Lord is the Son of God, because they also believe that he is God. Faith is not faith if it is not faith in God.
<p>Among all the truths that initiate faith and form it, the belief that the Lord is the Son of God is the first. This is clear from the Lord's reply to Peter when Peter said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. " Jesus said, "You are blessed, Simon. I say to you, on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it" (<a href="3927/matthew_16_16.htm">Matthew 16:16-18</a>). In this passage and elsewhere in the Word, the "rock" means the Lord in his role as divine truth as well as the divine truth that comes from the Lord. The truth that Peter stated is primary - it is the crown on the head and the scepter in the hand of Christ's body. This is clear from the Lord's saying that he is going to build his church on that rock and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. The following words in John show the nature of this point of faith: "If any confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them, and they live in God" (<a href="3927/1-john_4_15.htm">1 John 4:15</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] In addition to this sign that people have the one true faith, there is another: they believe that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth. This second sign follows from the previous one that the Lord is the Son of God. It also follows from the statements that all the fullness of divinity exists in him (<a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>); that he is the God of heaven and earth (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>); and that all things that belong to the Father are his (<a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>; <a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">16:15</a>).
<p>A third indication that people who believe in the Lord have an inner faith in him, and therefore have the one true faith, is that they believe the Lord is one with God the Father. The chapter on the Lord and redemption fully demonstrated that the Lord is one with God the Father and is the Father himself in human form. It is also obvious from the words of the Lord himself that he and the Father are one (<a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>); that the Father is in him and he in the Father (<a href="3927/john_10_38.htm">John 10:38</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">14:10-11</a>); that he said to his disciples that from then on they had seen and known the Father, and he looked at Philip and said that he was now seeing and knowing the Father (<a href="3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7</a> and following).
</p>
<p>
[4] These are the three definitive indications that people have faith in the Lord and that the faith they have is the one true faith. Not all who turn to the Lord have faith in him. True faith is an inner faith and an outer faith at the same time. People who have these three jewels of faith have both the inner aspects and the outer aspects of the faith. It is not only a treasure in their hearts but also a valuable asset to their lips.
<p>People who do not acknowledge that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, however, or that he is one with the Father, are inwardly looking toward other gods as well who have similar power. They see those other gods as having power that is to be used by the Son either as their representative or as someone who has earned the right through redemption to rule over the people he redeemed. People like this break true faith apart by dividing the unity of God. Once that unity is broken, faith no longer exists. Instead there is only a ghost of faith, which from an earthly perspective looks like an image of faith, but from a spiritual perspective looks like a monster from mythology.
<p>Can anyone deny that true faith is faith in one God who is the God of heaven and earth - therefore a faith in God the Father in human form, a faith in the Lord?
</p>
<p>
[5] These three identifying signs, pieces of evidence, and indications that a given faith in the Lord is faith itself are like touchstones used for identifying gold and silver. They are like stone markers or signposts along the road that show the way to the church building where the one true God is worshiped. They are like lighthouses on rocks by the sea that let sailors at night know where they are and which direction to steer their ships on the wind.
<p>The first identifying sign of faith, which is the belief that the Lord is the Son of the living God, is like the morning star for all who are coming into his church. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #379 (Chadwick, 1988)

<p>
379. (i) There is only one true faith, and this is in the Lord God the Saviour Jesus Christ, and is possessed by those who believe Him to be the Son of God, the God of heaven and earth, and one with the Father.<p>There is only one true faith, because faith is truth, and truth cannot be shattered and carved up, so that one part verges to the left, and one part to the right, and still remain its own truth. Faith as generally understood is composed of countless truths, for it is a collection of truths. But all these countless truths make up, as it were, a single body, to which the truths as its parts belong. Some make up the parts which are attached to the chest, such as arms and hands, some those which are attached to the hips, as the feet and soles. But the more inward truths make up the head, and those which are most nearly dependent upon them make up the sense organs in the face. The reason the more inward truths make up the head is that when what is more inward is mentioned, what is higher is also understood, for in the spiritual world everything more inward is also higher. So it is with the three heavens there. The soul and life of this body and all its parts is the Lord God the Saviour. This is why Paul calls the church the body of Christ, and people belonging to the church make up its parts depending upon their states of charity and faith. Paul also teaches that there is only one faith in these words:<p>There is one body and one spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God. He gave the task of ministry for the building of the body of Christ, until we all attain to oneness of faith and knowledge of the Son of God, and the perfect man <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
measured by the full stature of Christ, <a href="3927/ephesians_4_4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>, <a href="3927/ephesians_4_12.htm">12-13</a>.<p>It has been shown fully above (<a href="337.htm">337-339</a>) that the one true faith is in the Lord God the Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>
[2] The reason, however, why true faith is in the possession of those who believe the Lord to be the Son of God, is that they also believe that He is God, and faith if not in God is no faith at all. This is the leading tenet of all the truths which enter into faith and form it, as is clear from the Lord's words to Peter, when he said:<p>You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. You are blessed, Simon; I tell you, on this rock shall I build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it, <a href="3927/matthew_16_16.htm">Matthew 16:16-18</a>.<p>Rock here, as in other parts of the Word, means the Lord in respect of Divine truth, and also the Divine truth received from the Lord. This truth is pre-eminent, and is like a crown upon the head and like a sceptre in the hand of the body of Christ, as is clear from the Lord's saying that on that rock He would build His church and the gates of hell would not prevail against it, The following passage of John also proves that this is the nature of this tenet of faith:<p>If anyone shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God. <a href="3927/1-john_4_15.htm">1 John 4:15</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] Besides this mark, that they are in possession of the true and only faith, there is another, their belief that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth; this follows from the former point, that He is the Son of God, and from these passages:<p>In Him is all the fulness of the Godhead, <a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a><p>He is the God of heaven and earth, <a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>.<p>All things of the Father's are His, <a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>; <a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">16:15</a>.<p>The third indication that those who believe in the Lord are inwardly in possession of faith in Him, and so of the one true faith, is their belief that the Lord is one with God the Father. This fact, that He is one with God the Father and is the Father Himself present in the Human, was fully shown in the chapter on the Lord and Redemption, and is obvious from the sayings of the Lord Himself, that He and the Father are one (<a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>); that the Father is in Him, and He is in the Father (<a href="3927/john_10_38.htm">John 10:38</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">14:10-11</a>); that He said to the disciples that from that time on they had seen and known the Father, and that He looked at Philip and said that he then saw and knew the Father (<a href="3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7</a>ff).</p>
<p>
[4] The reason why these three things are the characteristic evidences of being in possession of faith in the Lord, and so in the one true faith, is that not all those who approach the Lord have faith in Him; for true faith is simultaneously internal and external. Those who possess these three treasures of faith are in possession of both its internals and its externals, so that it forms not only a treasury in their heart, but a jewel in their mouth. The case is different with those who do not acknowledge Him as God of heaven and earth, nor as one with the Father. These people also inwardly regard other gods as possessing similar power, which, however, is to be exercised by the Son, either regarded as a substitute or one who on account of His redeeming act has deserved to reign over those He has redeemed. But these people shatter the true faith by splitting the oneness of God; and when it is shattered it is no longer faith, but only the ghost of faith, which to the natural view may be some sort of image of faith, but to the spiritual view is a chimaera. Can anyone deny that true faith consists in belief in one God, who is the God of heaven and earth, and consequently in God the Father within a human form, that is, the Lord?</p>
<p>
[5] Those three marks, witnesses and indicators, that faith in the Lord is faith itself, are like touchstones by which gold and silver are identified; or like stones or sign-posts by the roadside showing the way to a church, where the one, true God is worshipped; or like lighthouses on rocks at sea, which allow sailors to know their position at night, and how to shape their course. The first mark of faith, that the Lord is the Son of the living God, is like the morning star to all who come into His church.<p>

</h4>
<p>
379. (1) True faith is the one only faith, which is a faith in the Lord God the Savior Jesus Christ and this is held by those who believe Him to be the Son of God, the God of heaven and earth, and one with the Father. True faith is the one only faith, because faith is truth, and truth cannot be broken or cut into fragments, with one part tending to the left and another to the right, and the truth of it still remain. In a general sense faith consists of innumerable truths, for it is the complex of them; but these innumerable truths constitute, as it were, a single body, and in that body there are truths that form its members, some forming the members that depend on the chest, as the arms and hands, and others those that depend on the loins, as the legs and feet; while interior truths form the head, and the truths first proceeding from them form the sensories located in the face. Interior truths form the head because interior means the same as higher; for in the spiritual world whatever is interior is also higher. This is true of the three heavens there. Of that body and of all its members, the Lord God the Savior is the soul and life; and this is why the church was called by Paul "the body of Christ," the men of the church, according to their states of charity and faith, constituting its members. That the true faith is the one only faith, Paul also teaches thus: <p>There is one body and one spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God; and He gave some for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ; till we all come into the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, and into the perfect man, into the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (<a href="3927/ephesians_4_4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-13</a>).
</p>
<p>
 [2] That the true faith, which is the one only faith, is a faith in the Lord God the Savior Jesus Christ, has been fully shown above (n. <a href="337.htm">337-339</a>). But those who believe the Lord to be the Son of God also have the true faith, because such believe Him to be God, and unless faith is faith in God it is no faith. That of all the truths that enter into faith and form it, this is the first, is evident from the Lord's words to Peter: <p>Peter said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God, and Jesus answered, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, and I say also unto thee, upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it (Matt.<a href="3927/matthew_16_16.htm">16:16-18</a>). By "rock" here and elsewhere in the Word, the Lord in respect to Divine truth is meant, and also Divine truth from the Lord. That this truth is the first truth and is like a diadem on the head and a scepter in the hand of the body of Christ, is evident from the Lord's saying, that upon that rock He would build His church, and the gates of hell should not prevail against it. That this is the first thing in faith, is also evident from these words in John: <p>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him and he in God (<a href="3927/1-john_4_15.htm">1 Epistle 4:15</a>).
</p>
<p>
[3] Besides this characteristic of being in the true faith, which is the one only faith, there is another, which is to believe that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth. This follows from the former, that He is the Son of God; also from the following: <p>That in Him dwelleth all the fullness of Divinity (<a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>) That He is the God of heaven and earth (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>); That all that the Father hath is His (<a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>; <a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">16:15</a>). A third proof that those who believe in the Lord are interiorly in faith in Him, thus in the true faith, which is the one only faith, is their believing the Lord to be one with God the Father. That He is one with God the Father, and that He is the Father Himself in the Human, has been fully shown in the chapter on the Lord and Redemption, and is plainly evident from the words of the Lord Himself: <p>That the Father and He are one (<a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>) <p>That the Father is in Him and He in the Father (<a href="3927/john_10_38.htm">John 10:38</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">14:10, 11</a>); <p>That He said to His disciples, that henceforth they had seen and known the Father; and He looked at Philip and said, that he then saw and knew the Father (<a href="3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7-10</a>).
</p>
<p>
[4] These three are distinguishing evidences that men have faith in the Lord, and thus the true faith, which is the one only faith; for not all who approach the Lord have faith in Him; for true faith is both internal and external; and those who possess these three precious things of faith are in both its internals and its externals so that it is not only a treasure in their hearts, but also a jewel in their mouths. It is otherwise with those who do not acknowledge the Lord as the God of heaven and earth, and as one with the Father. Such look interiorly to other gods also who possess like power, although this power is to be exercised by the Son, either vicariously or as one who on account of redemption is worthy to reign over those whom He has redeemed. But these break the true faith in pieces by dividing the unity of God, and when this is done, there is no longer any faith, but only the ghost of it, which when seen naturally looks like some image of it, but seen spiritually, becomes a chimera. Who can deny that the true faith is faith in one God, who is the God of heaven and earth, consequently, a faith in God the Father in a human form, that is, the Lord?
</p>
<p>
[5] These three marks, testimonies, and indications, that faith in the Lord is faith itself, are like the touch-stones whereby gold and silver are known; or they are like stones or fingerposts by the wayside, pointing the way to the temple where the one and true God is worshiped; or they are like lights on rocks in the sea, whereby those who are sailing at night may know where they are, and to what quarter to direct their ships. The first characteristic of faith, which is that the Lord is the Son of the living God, is like the morning star to all who enter His church. </p>

379. (1) The only true faith is faith in the Lord God, the Savior Jesus Christ; and this faith is held by those who believe Him to be the Son of God, and the God of heaven and earth, and one with the Father. There is only one true faith, because faith is truth, and truth cannot be broken and divided, so that one part may turn this way and one part that, and still remain truth. Faith in a general sense consists of innumerable truths, being an aggregate of these which constitute, as it were, one body, the several members of which are formed of various truths. Thus some truths form the members that depend on the breast; some, those that depend on the loins, as the feet and the soles of the feet; but interior truths form the head, and their nearest derivatives the sensory organs of the face. Interior truths form the head because the term interior implies also what is higher, for in the spiritual world whatever is interior is also higher, as is the case with the three heavens. The soul and life of this body and all its members is the Lord God, the Savior; hence the Church is called by Paul the body of Christ, and all who belong to the Church constitute its members according to the state of their charity and faith. That there is only one true faith, is also taught by Paul in these words:<p>"There is one body and one Spirit... One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God... And He gave some... for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ." <a href="3927/ephesians_4_4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>, <a href="3927/ephesians_4_12.htm">12-13</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] That the one true faith is a faith in the Lord God, the Savior Jesus Christ, has been shown above in <a href="337.htm">337-339</a>. Moreover, a true faith abides with those who believe the Lord to be the Son of God, because they also believe Him to be God; and faith is not faith unless it is directed towards God. That this fact pertaining to faith is the chief of all the truths that enter into faith and form it, is evident from the Lord's words to Peter, when he said,<p>"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God...".. "Blessed art thou, Simon...I say unto thee... upon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" Matthew 16:16-17, [<a href="3927/matthew_16_16.htm">16-18</a>].<p>By a rock here, as in other parts of the Word, is meant the Lord as to Divine Truth, and also Divine Truth from the Lord. That this truth is primary, and like a diadem on the head and a sceptre in the hand of the body of Christ, is evident from the declaration of the Lord, that upon that rock He would build His Church, and that the gates of hell would not prevail against it. The importance of this truth to faith is evident also from these words in John,<p>"Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God." <a href="3927/1-john_4_15.htm">1 John 4:15</a>.</p>
<p>
[3] Besides this mark that such believers are in the one true faith, there is a second, namely, they believe that the Lord is God of heaven and earth. This follows from the former, that He is the Son of God; and from the declarations that in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead, <a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>;<p>that He is the God of heaven and earth, <a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>; and that all things that the Father hath are His, <a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>, and <a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">John 16:15</a>.<p>There is a third indication that those who believe on the Lord are interiorly in faith towards Him, and are thus in the one true faith, namely, they believe that the Lord is one with God the Father. That He is one with God the Father, and is the Father Himself in His Human, was fully shown in the chapter concerning the Lord and Redemption, and is plainly evident from the statements of the Lord Himself,<p>that the Father and He are one, <a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>;<p>that the Father is in Him, and He in the Father <a href="3927/john_10_38.htm">John 10:38</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">14:10-11</a>; and He said to His disciples that henceforth they had seen and known the Father. Moreover, turning towards Philip, He said that he then saw and knew the Father, <a href="3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7</a>, and following verses.</p>
<p>
[4] These three are characteristic signs that men have faith in the Lord, and thus are in the one true faith, because not all who approach the Lord have faith in Him. True faith is internal, and at the same time external; and only those possessing these three precious characteristics are in the internals as well as the externals of that faith, which is thus not only a treasure in their heart but also a precious thing in their mouth. It is otherwise with those who do not acknowledge the Lord to be the God of heaven and earth, and one with the Father. For they interiorly regard other gods with similar power; which, however, must be exercised by the Son either as a deputy, or as one who, by the redemption wrought by Him, has merited the right to reign over those whom He has redeemed. Such persons rend asunder the true faith by dividing the Unity of God; and when it is thus broken it is no longer faith but merely a phantom, which, viewed naturally, appears as it were an image of faith, but viewed spiritually is a mere delusion. Who can deny that a true faith is faith in one God who is the God of heaven and earth, and consequently faith in God the Father in human form, that is, in the Lord?</p>
<p>
[5] These three characteristics, proofs and signs that faith in the Lord is faith itself are like touchstones by which gold and silver are tested. They are like directing stones and finger-posts on the road which point the way to the temple where the one true God is worshiped; and they are like lighthouses on rocks at sea, which by night inform the sailor where he is, and by what course to steer his ship. This first characteristic of faith, that the Lord is the Son of the living God, is like the morning star to all who enter His Church. </p>

379. I. QUOD FIDES VERA SIT UNICA, ET QUOD SIT IN DOMINUM DEUM SALVATOREM JESUM CHRISTUM, ET QUOD SIT APUD ILLOS, QUI CREDUNT IPSUM ESSE FILIUM DEI, DEUM COELI ET TERRAE, AC UNUM CUM PATRE. Quod Fides vera sit unica, est quia fides est veritas, ac veritas non potest confringi et bissecari, ut pars ejus vergat ad sinistrum et pars ad dextrum, et maneat sua veritas: Fides in communi sensu constat ex innumeris veritatibus, est enim complexus illarum, sed innumerae illae faciunt sicut unum Corpus, et in illo Corpore sunt Veritates, quae faciunt membra ejus, quaedam faciunt membra quae pendent a pectore, ut brachia et manus, quaedam quae pendent a lumbis, ut pedes et plantae; veritates autem interiores faciunt Caput, et veritates quae proxime inde procedunt, faciunt Sensoria quae in facie sunt; quod Veritates interiores faciant Caput, est quia dum nominatur Interius, intelligitur etiam Superius, nam in Mundo spirituali omnia interiora sunt etiam superiora, ita est cum tribus Coelis ibi; hujus Corporis et omnium ejus membrorum Anima et Vita, est Dominus Deus Salvator, inde est, quod Ecclesia a Paulo vocata sit Corpus Christi, et quod homines Ecclesiae secundum status charitatis et fidei apud illos faciant membra ejus; quod Fides vera sit unica, etiam docet Paulus ita, Est <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
unum Corpus et unus Spiritus, unus Dominus, UNA FIDES, unum Baptisma, unus Deus; dedit opus ministerii in aedificationem CORPORIS CHRISTI, usque dum perveniamus omnes in UNITATEM FIDEI, et cognitionem Filii Dei, et vitam perfectam in mensuram aetatis plenitudinis Christi, ad <a href="3927/ephesians_4_4.htm">Ephesos 4:4-6</a>, <a href="3927/ephesians_4_12.htm">12-13</a>. Quod fides Vera, quae est unica, sit in Dominum Deum Salvatorem Jesum Christum, supra <a href="337.htm">337-339</a>, plene ostensum est.</p>
<p>
[2] Quod autem Fides vera sit apud illos qui credunt Dominum esse Filium Dei, causa est, quia illi etiam credunt quod sit Deus, et fides non est fides nisi in Deum; quod hoc fidei sit primarium omnium veritatum quae ingrediuntur Fidem, et formant illam, constat ex Domini Verbis ad Petrum, cum dixit, TU ES CHRISTUS, FILIUS DEI VIVENTIS; beatus es Simon: tibi dico, super hac Petra aedificabo Ecclesiam meam, et portae Inferni non <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
praevalebunt illi, <a href="3927/matthew_16_16.htm">Matthaeus 16:16-17</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_16_18.htm">18</a>; <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
per Petram hic, ut alibi in Verbo, intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, et quoque Divinum Verum a Domino; quod hoc Verum sit Primarium, et sicut diadema super capite, et sicut sceptrum in manu Corporis Christi, constat ex verbis Domini, quod super illam Petram aedificaturus sit Ecclesiam suam, et quod portae Inferni non praevaliturae sint illi: quod hoc fidei tale sit, constat etiam ex his apud Johannem, Quisquis confessus fuerit, quod Jesus sit Filius Dei, Deus in eo manet, et ille in Deo, I Epist. <a href="3927/1-john_4_15.htm">4:15</a>. <sup "fn120_4">4</sup>
</p>
<p>
[3] Praeter hoc Characteristicon quod sint in vera fide quae unica, est etiam alterum, quod credant Dominum esse Deum Coeli et Terrae, hoc sequitur ex priori, quod sit Filius Dei, et ex his, Quod in Ipso sit omnis plenitudo Divinitatis, <a href="3927/colossians_2_9.htm">Colossenses 2:9</a>. Quod sit Deus Coeli et Terrae, <a href="3927/matthew_27_18.htm">Matthaeus 27:18</a>. Quod omnia Patris Ipsius sint, <a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">Johannes 3:35</a>; <a href="3927/john_16_15.htm">16:15</a>. Tertium indicium, quod illi qui credunt in Dominum, sint interius in fide in Ipsum, <sup "fn120_5">5</sup>
ita in vera fide quae unica, sit quod credant <sup "fn120_6">6</sup>
quod Dominus sit unum cum Deo Patre; quod unus sit cum Deo Patre, et quod sit ipse Pater in Humano, plene ostensum est in Capite de Domino et Redemptione, et evidenter constat ab Ipsius Domini verbis, Quod Pater et Ipse unum sint, <a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">Johannes 10:30</a>. Quod Pater in Ipso et Ipse in Patre sit, <a href="3927/john_10_38.htm">Johannes 10:38</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">14:10-11</a>. <sup "fn120_7">7</sup>
Quod dixerit ad Discipulos, quod a nunc viderint et cognoverint Patrem, et quod aspexerit Philippum, et dixerit, quod nunc videat et cognoscat Patrem, <a href="3927/john_14_7.htm">Johannes 14:7</a>, seq.</p>
<p>
[4] Quod haec Tria sint Testimonia Characteristica, quod sint in fide in Dominum, ita in vera fide quae est unica, est quia non omnes illi qui adeunt Dominum, in fide in Ipsum sunt, vera enim fides est interna et simul externa; illi apud quos tres illae pretiositates fidei sunt, tam in internis illius fidei quam in externis ejus sunt, ita est illa non modo thesaurus in corde illorum, sed etiam cimelium in ore illorum; aliter apud illos, qui non agnoscunt Ipsum Deum Coeli et Terrae, et non Unum cum Patre; hi interius etiam spectant ad alios Deos, quibus est similis potestas, sed quod haec exercenda sit a Filio, aut sicut Vicario, aut sicut qui propter Redemptionem meruit regnare super illos quos redemit; sed hi veram fidem diffringunt per divisionem unitatis Dei, qua diffracta non amplius est fides, sed modo larva fidei, quae naturaliter visa apparet sicut aliqua imago ejus, sed spiritualiter visa fit chimera: quis potest negare, quin vera fides sit in unum Deum, qui est Deus Coeli et Terrae, consequenter in Deum Patrem in forma humana, ita in Dominum.</p>
<p>
[5] Illi tres Characteres, Testes, et Indices, quod fides in Dominum sit ipsa fides, sunt sicut Lapides lydii, per quos cognoscitur aurum et argentum: et sunt sicut lapides aut manus in viis, qui monstrant viam ad Templum, ubi unus et verus Deus colitur: et sunt sicut lampades super petris in mari, ex quibus navigantes in noctibus sciunt ubi sunt, et quo vento dirigent naves; Primus Character fidei, qui est, quod Dominus sit Filius Dei viventis, est sicut Stella matutina omnibus, qui intrant in Ipsius Ecclesiam.<p>
