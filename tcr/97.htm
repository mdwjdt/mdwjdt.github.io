<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>97</b>. （6）主通过救赎行为使自己与父合一，父也将自己与祂合一。这种合一通过救赎行为实现，因为主通过祂的人身执行这些行为。由于祂是这样做的，所以父所表示的神性越来越接近、帮助并配合祂，直到最终他们结合起来，以至于不再是二，而是一。这种合一就是下文所论述的荣耀。</p>

<p>
97. (6)通過這些行為, 祂自己與父聯合,父自己與祂聯合, 這也遵循聖規。
<p>因為主以祂的人身完成了救贖的行為, 這些行為帶來這樣的聯合。當祂完成這些, 代表神性之本的"父"更加接近祂,幫助祂,與祂配合。最後鍛造出如此親密的關係, 以致於不再是二,而成為一。這樣的聯合就是接下來所說的"榮耀"。 </p>

97. 6. Through those same acts the Lord united himself to the Father and the Father united himself to him. Acts of redemption brought about this union because the Lord performed these acts in his human manifestation. As he performed them, the Divine meant by the Father came closer to him, helped him, and cooperated with him. At last they forged so close a partnership that they were not two but one. This union is the "glorification" referred to in what follows. </p>

97. (vi) BY THE SAME ACTS THE LORD UNITED HIMSELF WITH THE FATHER, AND THE FATHER WITH HIM.<p>The reason why the union took place through redeeming acts was that the Lord performed them by His Human; and as He did so, the Divine meant by the Father came closer, helped and worked with Him, until eventually they so joined themselves that they were not two but one. This union is glorification, which will be described in the following pages. </p>

97. (6) Through the same acts the Lord united Himself to the Father and the Father united Himself to Him. This union was effected by the acts of redemption, because the Lord performed these acts from His Human, and as He did this, the Divine which is meant by the Father drew nearer, and aided, and cooperated, and finally they so conjoined themselves as to be not two but one; which union is the glorification which will be treated of in what follows. </p>

97. VI. QUOD DOMINUS PER EOSDEM ACTUS SE UNIVERIT PATRI ET PATER SE IPSI. Quod unio facta sit per actus redemptionis, est quia Dominus illos ex Humano suo operatus est, et sicut operatus est, ita Divinum quod intelligitur per Patrem propius accessit, adjuvit et cooperatum est, et tandem se conjunxerunt ita, ut non duo sed unum essent; et haec Unio est Glorificatio, de qua in sequentibus. </p>
