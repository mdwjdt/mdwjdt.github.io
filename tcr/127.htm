<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第127节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>127</b>.救赎和十字架受难必须被视为两个截然不同的事件；否则，人的心智就会搁浅，就象船只及其上的舵手、船长和船员一起撞到堤岸或岩石上，失去控制；也就是说，它会在关乎主救赎的一切事上误入歧途。若对这两个不同事件没有一个清晰的概念，人就如同在梦中看到虚幻事物，并从这些事物中得出结论，以之为真，而事实上，它们是荒诞不经的；或他就象有人在夜间行走，抓住一些树叶，以为它们是某个人的头发，走近后，却将自己的头发缠到了树枝上。不过，尽管救赎与十字架受难是两个不同事件，但它们在实现救赎的过程中仍合而为一。因为主凭借祂与父的合一（这种合一通过十字架受难成就）而成为永恒的救赎主。</p>

127. 救贖與十字架受難必須分別對待。要不然人的思想就會擱淺, 如同船在沙灘或礁石擱淺, 舵手,船長和所有船員都會迷失無助。對所有關於主拯救的事項也是如此。如果沒有將這二者清晰分開對待, 人就像在夢中看物, 從虛幻之物得結論, 但其實是荒誕可笑的。又如某人晚間走去樹林約會, 當他抓著樹的枝條, 以為是某人的頭髮, 於是向前靠近, 誰料把自己頭髮纏住了。
<p>儘管救贖與十字架受難是兩個不同的事情, 但在一同貢獻於拯救時, 二者如一。當通過十字架的受難, 主與祂的父完全聯合時, 祂就成了永遠的救贖主。 </p>

<p>
127. Redemption and the suffering on the cross must be seen as separate. Otherwise the human mind gets wrecked as a ship does on sandbars or rocks, causing the loss of the ship, the helmsman, the captain, and the sailors. It goes astray in everything having to do with salvation by the Lord. If we lack separate ideas of these two things we are in a kind of dream; we see images that are unreal and we make conjectures based on them that we think are real but are just made up. We are like someone walking out [to a tryst] at night, who, thinking that the leaves of a tree within his grasp are human tresses, sidles closer, only to entangle his own hair in them.
<p>Although redemption and the suffering on the cross are two different things, nevertheless they become one in contributing to salvation. When the Lord became united to his Father, which happened through the suffering on the cross, he became the Redeemer forever. </p>

127. Redemption and the passion on the cross must be thought of as two distinct events; otherwise men's minds will ground like a ship on sandbanks or rocks and sink, steersman, captain, crew and all, that is to say, it will go astray in all matters which concern salvation from the Lord. Without a clear view of these two distinct events a person is like one who sees imaginary things in a dream, and draws inferences from things he takes to be real, but are in fact absurd. Or he is like someone walking at night-time, and when he grasps the branches of a tree, thinks it is someone's hair, so he comes closer and gets his own hair entangled. But although redemption and the passion on the cross are two distinct events, still they are combined in effecting salvation, since the Lord by His union with the Father, the result of His suffering on the cross, became the Redeemer for ever. </p>

127. These two things, redemption and the passion of the cross, must be seen to be distinct; otherwise the human mind, like a vessel, strikes upon sand-banks or rocks and is lost, with pilot, captain, and crew together; that is, it errs in all things pertaining to salvation by the Lord. For without an idea of these two things as distinct, man is as if in a dream, and sees imaginary things, and from these draws conclusions, supposing them to be real when yet they are fantastic; or he is like one walking in the dark, who takes hold of the leaves of some tree and thinks them to be the hair of a man, and going nearer entangles his own hair in the branches. But although redemption and the passion of the cross are two distinct things, yet in reference to salvation they make one; since it was by union with His Father, which was completed through the passion of the cross, that the Lord became the Redeemer to eternity. </p>

127. These two things, redemption and the passion of the cross, must be considered as distinct; otherwise the human mind is like a ship, which strikes upon quicksands or rocks, and is lost with pilot, captain and crew; that is, it falls into error in all things which relate to salvation by the Lord. For without an idea of these two things as distinct from each other, a man is, as it were, in a dream, seeing imaginary things, and he draws inferences from things which he believes to be real, but which nevertheless are only absurd; or he is like one walking by night, who takes hold of the leaves of some tree, supposing them to be the hair of a man, and who, coming nearer, entangles his own hair in the branches. Although redemption and the passion of the cross are two distinct things, yet they make one with respect to salvation; since the Lord, by union with His Father, which was completed by the passion of the cross, became the Redeemer to eternity. </p>

</h4>
<p>
127. Haec duo, Redemptio et Passio crucis, distincte percipienda sunt, alioquin incidit mens humana sicut navis in syrtes aut in scopulos, ac perit una cum gubernatore, nauclero et nautis, hoc est, errat in omnibus illis, quae salvationis a Domino sunt: nam homo absque distincta idea de duobus illis, est tanquam in somnio et videt vana, et auguratur ex illis, quae credit realia esse, cum tamen sunt ludicra; aut est sicut qui ambulat in nocte, et dum arripit frondes alicujus arboris, credit crines hominis esse, et accedit propius, et suos crines eis implicat. Sed tametsi Redemptio et Passio crucis duo distincta sunt, usque ad salvationem unum faciunt, quoniam Dominus per Unionem cum suo Patre, quae per Passionem crucis peracta est, factus est Redemptor in aeternum. </p>
