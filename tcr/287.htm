<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">十诫的字义包含教义与生活的一般戒律，而它们的属灵和属天之义则普遍包含一切戒律</h4><br />287.众所周知，在圣言中，十诫被称为首要律法，因为它们囊括了教义与生活的一切，不仅包括涉及神的一切事，还包括涉及人的一切事。因此，这律法被刻在两块石版上，其中一块涉及上帝，另一块涉及人。人们也都知道，属教义与生活的一切都与爱神爱邻有关；属于这些爱的一切都包含在十诫中。整部圣言并没有教导别的，这一事实从主的这些话可以看出来：<br />耶稣说，你要尽心、尽性、尽意爱主你的神，其次要爱邻如己，这两条诫命是律法和先知一切道理的总纲。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.35.htm">马太福音22:35</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.37.htm">37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.40.htm">40</a>）<br />律法和先知表整部圣言。还有：<br />有一个律法师试探耶稣说，夫子！我该作什么才可以承受永生？耶稣对他说，律法上写的是什么？你念的是怎样呢？他回答说，你要尽心、尽性、尽力、尽意爱主你的神，又要爱邻舍如同自己。耶稣说，你这样行，就必活着。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.25.htm">路加福音10:25</a>－<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.28.htm">28</a>）<br />由于爱神爱邻是圣言的全部，而十诫的第一块石版概括地包含对神之爱的全部，第二块则包含对邻之爱的全部，故可知这两块石版包含教义与生活的全部。看看这两块石版就清楚明白，它们以这种方式联结：神通过祂的石版关注人，人通过他的石版反过来关注神，因此这种关注是相互的，也就是说，神这一方从未停止关注人，也从未停止实施其救恩所必需的行动；若人接受并行出写在他石版上的事，一种相互联结就产生了。然后，照主应许给律法师的话说：“你这样行，就必活着”。</p>

<p>
287. 十誡的文字意義包含教義與生活的一般規則, 而其屬靈與屬天意義則囊括了一切普遍的規則
<p>眾所周知, 十誡在聖言中被稱為最高意義的律法, 因為它們包括了關於教義與生活的一切事情, 不僅包括關於上帝的一切事情, 還包括關於我們的一切事情。因此, 此律法被刻在兩塊石版上, 其中之一涉及上帝, 另一塊關於我們。
<p>人們都知道所有的教義與生活的規則都歸納於:愛上帝和愛鄰舍。十誡包含愛上帝和愛鄰舍的一切教導。全部聖言所教導的, 除此之外, 沒有別的, 可明顯從主所說的這些話中看出:耶穌說:"你要盡心,盡性,盡意愛主你的上帝, 其次要愛鄰舍如己, 這兩條誡命是律法和先知的一切道理的總綱"(<a href="3927/matthew_22_35.htm">馬太福音22:35-37</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_22_40.htm">40</a>)。律法和先知表示全部聖言。
<p>另外還說:有律法師起來試探耶穌, 說:"夫子！我該作什麼才可以承受永生？"耶穌對他說:"律法上寫的是什麼？你念的是怎樣呢？"他回答說:"你要盡心,盡性,盡力,盡意愛主你的上帝, 又要愛鄰舍如同自己。"耶穌說:"你回答的是, 你這樣行, 就必得永生"(<a href="3927/luke_10_25.htm">路加福音10:25-28</a>)。
<p>因為愛上帝與愛鄰舍是聖言的全部, 又因第一塊石版包含著一切愛上帝的總結, 第二塊則是愛鄰舍的總結, 於是可知兩塊石版包含著當去教導一切事情, 也包括生活的一切事情。
<p>倘若你想像一下兩塊石版的內容, 可看出二者如何保持聯結:上帝由祂那塊石版來看我們, 而我們由自己這塊來看上帝。因此, 彼此相互轉向對方。在上帝這邊, 祂關注我們並為了我們得救而履行自己必須完成的事務, 這方面祂從不落空; 倘若我們接受並踐行我們這塊石版上所記之事, 人與上帝之間的相互連接就產生了。接下來會發生什麼, 正如主對律法師所言:"你這樣行, 就必得永生。" </p>

287. In Their Literal Meaning, the Ten Commandments
<p>Contain General Principles to Be Taught and Lived;
<p>in Their Spiritual and Heavenly Meanings,
<p>They Contain Absolutely Everything
<p>It is generally recognized that the Ten Commandments in the Word are called the law in a supreme sense because they contain all the principles to be taught and lived. They contain not only all the principles related to God but also all the principles related to us. For this reason this law was engraved on two tablets, one of which relates to God and the other to us.
<p>It is also generally recognized that all the principles to be taught and lived come down to loving God and loving our neighbor. The Ten Commandments contain all the teachings about these two kinds of love. The entire Word teaches nothing else, as the Lord's words make clear:
<p>Jesus said, "You are to love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself. The Law and the Prophets hinge on these two commandments. " (<a href="3927/matthew_22_37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>)
<p>"The Law and the Prophets" means the entire Word.
<p>Further,
<p>A lawyer tested Jesus by saying, "Master, what should I do to inherit eternal life?" Jesus said to him, "What has been written in the law? How do you read it?" He replied, "You are to love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself. " And Jesus said, "Do this and you will live. " (<a href="3927/luke_10_25.htm">Luke 10:25-28</a>)
<p>Because everything in the Word is about loving God and loving our neighbor, and the first tablet of the Ten Commandments contains a summary of everything about loving God while the second tablet contains a summary of everything about loving our neighbor, it follows that the Ten Commandments contain everything to be taught and lived.
<p>If you visualize the two tablets, it is clear how they are connected. God looks at us from his tablet and we look at God from ours. The two tablets are therefore turned toward each other. On God's side it never fails that he is looking at us and doing what has to be done for our salvation. If we accept and do the things on our tablet, a reciprocal partnership [with God] develops. What happens to us then is indicated by the Lord's words to the lawyer: "Do this and you will live. " </p>

287. The literal sense of the Ten Commandments contains general instructions on doctrine and life; but their spiritual and celestial senses contain universal instructions.<p>It is well known that the Ten Commandments are called in the Word the Law par excellence, because they contain everything concerning doctrine and life, not only everything which concerns God, but also everything which concerns man. That is why the law was written on two tablets, one dealing with God, the other with man. It is also well known that the whole of doctrine and life relate to love to God and love towards the neighbour. The whole of these loves is contained in the Ten Commandments. This is the teaching of the whole Word, as is evident from these words of the Lord:<p>Jesus said, You are to love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul and with all your mind, and your neighbour as yourself. The law and the prophets depend upon these two commandments, <a href="3927/matthew_22_35.htm">Matthew 22:35-37</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_22_40.htm">40</a>.<p>The law and the prophets mean the whole Word. And further:<p>A lawyer testing Jesus said, Master, what must I do to inherit everlasting life? And Jesus said to him, What is written in the law? What is your reading of it? And he in answer said, You are to love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbour as yourself. And Jesus said, Do this, and you will live, <a href="3927/luke_10_25.htm">Luke 10:25-28</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] Now since love to God and love towards the neighbour are the whole of the Word; and since the first tablet of the Ten Commandments contains in summary form the whole of love to God, and the second tablet contains the whole of love towards the neighbour, it follows that they contain the whole of doctrine and life. A look at the two tablets makes it plain that they are so linked that God from His tablet has man in view, and man in his turn from his has God in view. Thus there is a reciprocal viewing, such that on God's part He never fails to keep man in view and perform the actions needed for his salvation; and if a person accepts and does the things laid down in his tablet, the link becomes reciprocal. Then, as the Lord's words promised to the lawyer, 'Do this, and you will live.' </p>

287. IN THE SENSE OF THE LETTER THE DECALOGUE CONTAINS THE GENERAL PRECEPTS OF DOCTRINE AND LIFE, BUT IN THE SPIRITUAL AND CELESTIAL SENSES IT CONTAINS ALL PRECEPTS UNIVERSALLY. <p>It is known that in the Word the Decalogue is called by way of eminence the Law, because it contains all things of Doctrine and life; for it contains both all things that look to God, and all things that look to man. For this reason the law was written on two tables, one of which treats of God, the other of man. It is also known that all things belonging to doctrine and life have reference to love to God and love towards the neighbor; and all things pertaining to these loves are contained in the Decalogue. That in the whole Word nothing else is taught can be seen from these words of the Lord: <p>Jesus said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God from all thy heart, and in all thy soul, and in all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang the law and the prophets (<a href="3927/matthew_22_37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_22_39.htm">39-40</a>). <p>"The law and the prophets" signify the whole Word. And again: <p>A certain lawyer, tempting Jesus, said, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? And Jesus said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself. And Jesus said, This do, and thou shalt live (<a href="3927/luke_10_25.htm">Luke 10:25-28</a>). <p>Since then, love to God and love towards the neighbor are the whole of the Word, and the first table of the Decalogue contains in a summary all things pertaining to love to God, and the second table all things pertaining to love to the neighbor, it follows that the Decalogue contains all things of doctrine and life. From these two tables so regarded it is plain that they are connected in such a manner that God from His table looks to man, and man from his table in turn looks to God, thus the looking is reciprocal, that is, it is such that God on His part never ceases to look to man and to make operative such things as relate to man's salvation; and when man receives and does what is written on his table, a reciprocal conjunction is effected; and then comes to pass what the Lord said to the lawyer, "This do, and thou shalt live." </p>

287. Quod Decalogus in Sensu literae contineat communia Praecepta Doctrinae et Vitae; in Sensu autem Spirituali et Coelesti Universaliter omnia.<p>Notum est, quod Decalogus in Verbo in eminentia dicatur Lex, quia continet omnia quae Doctrinae et Vitae sunt, nam non modo omnia quae spectant Deum, sed etiam omnia quae spectant hominem, quare Lex illa inscripta est duabus Tabulis, quarum una agit de Deo, altera de homine. Notum etiam est, quod omnia Doctrinae et Vitae se referant ad amorem in Deum, et ad amorem erga proximum, horum amorum omnia continentur in Decalogo: quod totum Verbum non aliud doceat, constat ex his Domini verbis, JESUS dixit, amabis Dominum Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo, et in tota anima tua, et in tota mente tua; et Proximum sicut teipsum; ex his duobus mandatis Lex et Prophetae pendent, <a href="3927/matthew_22_35.htm">Matthaeus 22:35</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_22_36.htm">36</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_22_37.htm">37-38</a>, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
Lex et Prophetae significant totum Verbum. Et porro, Unus Legisperitus tentans JESUM, dixit, Magister, quid faciam, ut vitam aeternam haereditem; et JESUS ad illum dixit, in Lege quid scriptum est; quomodo legis, et ille respondens dixit, amabis Dominum Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo, et ex tota anima tua, et ex toto robore tuo, et ex tota mente tua, et proximum sicut teipsum; et Jesus dixit, HOC FAC ET VIVES, <a href="3927/luke_10_25.htm">Luca 10:25-28</a>.</p>
<p>
[2] Nunc quia Amor in Deum, et Amor erga proximum, sunt omnia Verbi, et Decalogus in Prima Tabula in summario continet omnia amoris in Deum, et in Secunda Tabula omnia amoris erga proximum, sequitur quod contineat omnia quae Doctrinae et Vitae sunt. Ex visis binis Tabulis patet, quod ita conjunctae sint, ut Deus ex sua Tabula spectet hominem, et quod homo ex sua spectet Deum vicissim, et sic quod sit Aspectus reciprocus, qui talis est, ut a parte Dei nusquam desit, quin spectet hominem, ac operetur talia quae salutis ejus sunt, et si homo recipit et facit illa quae in sua Tabula sunt, fiat conjunctio reciproca, et tunc fit secundum Domini verba ad Legisperitum, Hoc fac et vives.<p>
