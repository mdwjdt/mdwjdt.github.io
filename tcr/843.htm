843. 灵界的犹太人和在世时一样, 涉足各种各样的物品交易, 特别是宝石。 他们不知用什么方法从天上获得这些宝石, 天上有大量这样的宝石。 他们做宝石交易的原因是, 圣言最初是用他们的语言写成的, 他们阅读圣言, 并视其字义为神圣, 宝石就对应于字义。 宝石的属灵源头就是圣言字义, 它们之间存在对应关系, 对此, 可查看圣经一章 (n。<a href="217.htm">217</a>, <a href="218.htm">218</a>)。 此外, 犹太人能人工仿制这些宝石, 以假乱真, 但这样做的人会受到管理者的重罚。 </p>

843. In the spiritual world Jews trade in various commodities, just as they do in this world - especially in precious stones. In ways that I do not know about, they acquire gems from heaven, where precious stones exist in great abundance. The reason why they deal in precious stones is that they read the Word in its original language and consider its literal meaning holy. Precious stones correspond to the literal meaning. (I have shown above in the chapter on Sacred Scripture, 217, 218, that the spiritual origin of precious stones is the Word's literal meaning and that as a result those stones and that meaning correspond to each other.) They also possess the skill to make fake gems and fool buyers, but if they actually commit this fraud they are severely punished by the governors. </p>

843. In that world as in the previous one the Jews are merchants dealing in various goods, especially precious stones, which they acquire by ways unknown to me from heaven, where they are plentiful. The reason they trade in precious stones is that they read the Word in its original language and regard its literal sense as holy; precious stones correspond to the literal sense. For the literal sense of the Word being the spiritual source of those stones, so that there is a correspondence between them, see above in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture (<a href="217.htm">217-218</a>). They are even able to fake imitations and induce the notion that they are genuine; but these people are severely punished by their rulers. </p>

843. In that world as in the former the Jews traffic in various articles, especially in precious stones, which they obtain for themselves by unknown ways from heaven, where there are precious stones in abundance. They traffic in precious stones because they read the Word in the original tongue, and hold the sense of its letter to be holy, precious stones corresponding to that sense. That the spiritual origin of precious stones is the sense of the letter of the Word, and that from this arises their correspondence, may be seen above in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture (n. <a href="217.htm">217, 218</a>). Moreover, the Jews are able to imitate these stones artificially, and to produce the illusion that they are genuine; but those who do so are heavily fined by their governors. </p>

843. The Jews in the spiritual world, as in the former world, trade in various articles, especially in precious stones, which by unknown ways they procure for themselves from heaven, where they are precious stones in abundance. They traffic in precious stones because they read the Word in its original language, and regard the sense of the Letter as holy; and precious stones correspond to the sense of the Letter. Now it may be seen above in the chapter on the Sacred Scripture, Nos. <a href="217.htm">217-218</a>, that the spiritual origin of such stones is the sense of the Letter of the Word, and that their correspondence is due to this fact. They can also make artificial stones like these, and can produce the illusion that they are real; but those who do this are heavily fined by their governors. </p>

843. Judaei negotiantur in illo Mundo sicut in priori cum variis, imprimis cum Lapidibus pretiosis, quos sibi per vias incognitas comparant e Coelo, ubi Lapides pretiosi in copia sunt. Quod Negotiatio illis cum Lapidibus pretiosis sit, est causa, quia Verbum in sua originali Lingua legunt, et Sensum literae ejus Sanctum habent, ac Lapides pretiosi Sensui literae correspondent; quod spiritualis origo illorum Lapidum sit Sensus literae Verbi, et quod inde sit correspondentia illorum, supra in Capite de SCRIPTURA SACRA <a href="217.htm">217-218</a>, videatur. Possunt etiam arte parare similes ac phantasiam inducere, quod genuini sint; sed hi a suis Praefectis severe mulctantur. </p>
