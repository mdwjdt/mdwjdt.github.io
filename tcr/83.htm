83. 所謂有一從永遠生出之子降世並取了人的樣式, 這樣的觀念在以下聖言的經句面前瞬間變得完全的錯誤,粉碎並消匿無影, 在這些聖言中, 耶和華自己明言祂就是拯救者和救贖者:
<p>我不是耶和華嗎？除我之外再沒有上帝; 除了我以外, 沒有公義的上帝和救主(<a href="3927/isaiah_45_21.htm">以賽亞書45:21-22</a>)。我是耶和華, 除我以外沒有救主(<a href="3927/isaiah_43_11.htm">以賽亞書43:11</a>)。我是耶和華你的上帝, 除我以外, 你不要去認任何上帝, 並且除我以外沒有救主(<a href="3927/hosea_13_4.htm">何西阿書13:4</a>)。凡有血氣的必都知道我耶和華是你的救主和救贖主(<a href="3927/isaiah_49_26.htm">以賽亞書49:26</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_60_16.htm">60:16</a>)。至於我們的救贖主, 萬軍之耶和華是祂的名字(<a href="3927/isaiah_47_4.htm">以賽亞書47:4</a>)。他們的救贖主, 萬軍之耶和華是祂的名字(<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_34.htm">耶利米書50:34</a>)。耶和華, 我的磐石, 我的救贖主(<a href="3927/psalms_19_14.htm">詩篇19:14</a>)。耶和華你們的救贖主, 以色列的聖者如此說:"我是耶和華你們的上帝"(<a href="3927/isaiah_48_17.htm">以賽亞書48:17</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_43_14.htm">43:14</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_49_7.htm">49:7</a>)。耶和華你們的救贖主如此說:"我是創造成物的耶和華, 我獨立鋪張諸天, 自己鋪開大地"(<a href="3927/isaiah_44_24.htm">以賽亞書44:24</a>)。耶和華以色列的君, 以色列的救贖主萬軍之耶和華如此說:"我是首先的, 我是末後的;除我以外再沒有上帝(<a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">以賽亞書44:6</a>)。你是耶和華我們的父, 從亙古以來, 禰名為"我們的救贖主"(<a href="3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">以賽亞書63:16</a>)。我要以永遠的慈愛憐恤你, 這是耶和華你的救贖主說的(<a href="3927/isaiah_54_8.htm">以賽亞書54:8</a>)。可信可靠的耶和華啊, 你救贖了我(<a href="3927/psalms_31_5.htm">詩篇31:5</a>)。以色列啊, 你當仰望耶和華, 因祂有慈愛, 有豐盛的救恩。祂必救贖以色列脫離一切的罪(<a href="3927/psalms_130_7.htm">詩篇130:7-8</a>)。萬軍之耶和華是祂的名字, 你的救贖主是以色列的聖者; 祂必稱為全地之上帝(<a href="3927/isaiah_54_5.htm">以賽亞書54:5</a>)。
<p>從這些,以及更多其它的經句, 任何有眼有腦之人都當看出, 這獨一的上帝為了施行救贖, 降世並取了人的樣式。任何人注意到以上列舉的聖言, 就會非常清楚地看出這點, 明白得如同晨光照射下的物體。
<p>然而, 還是有些在夜晚黑暗之中的人確信有另一位從永遠被生出,降世拯救我們的另一位上帝, 他們對以上的聖言熟視無睹, 更離譜地將這些聖言強行附會他們的錯誤觀念。 </p>

83. The idea that it was some eternally begotten Son who came down and took on a human manifestation turns out to be utterly wrong, collapses, and vanishes in the face of passages in the Word like the following, where Jehovah himself says that he is the Savior and Redeemer:
<p>Am not I Jehovah? And there is no other God except me. I am a just God, and there is no Savior except me. (<a href="3927/isaiah_45_21.htm">Isaiah 45:21-22</a>)
<p>I am Jehovah, and there is no Savior except me. (<a href="3927/isaiah_43_11.htm">Isaiah 43:11</a>)
<p>I am Jehovah, your God, and you are not to acknowledge a God except me. There is no Savior except me. (<a href="3927/hosea_13_4.htm">Hosea 13:4</a>)
<p>So that all flesh may know that I, Jehovah, am your Savior and your Redeemer. (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_60_16.htm">60:16</a>)
<p>As for our Redeemer, Jehovah Sabaoth is his name. (<a href="3927/isaiah_47_4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a>)
<p>Their Redeemer is strong; Jehovah Sabaoth is his name. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_34.htm">Jeremiah 50:34</a>)
<p>Jehovah, my rock and my Redeemer. (<a href="3927/psalms_19_14.htm">Psalms 19:14</a>)
<p>Thus says Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: "I am Jehovah, your God. " (<a href="3927/isaiah_48_17.htm">Isaiah 48:17</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_43_14.htm">43:14</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_49_7.htm">49:7</a>)
<p>Thus said Jehovah, your Redeemer: "I, Jehovah, am the maker of all things. I alone [stretch out the heavens. I extend the earth] by myself. " (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>)
<p>Thus said Jehovah, the King of Israel, and its Redeemer, Jehovah Sabaoth: "I am the First and the Last, and there is no God except me. " (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>)
<p>You, Jehovah, are our Father; our Redeemer from everlasting is your name. (<a href="3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>)
<p>"With the compassion of eternity I will have mercy. " So says your Redeemer, Jehovah. (<a href="3927/isaiah_54_8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>)
<p>You have redeemed me, Jehovah of truth. (<a href="3927/psalms_31_6.htm">Psalms 31:6</a>)
<p>Israel should hope in Jehovah, because with Jehovah there is compassion; with him there is the most redemption. He will redeem Israel from all its forms of wickedness. ()
<p>Jehovah God and your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, will be called God of all the earth. (<a href="3927/isaiah_54_5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>)
<p>From these passages and very many others, all who have eyes and open minds can see that God, who is one, came down and became human for the purpose of redeeming people. Anyone who pays attention to the divine sayings just quoted can see this as clearly as something in the morning light.
<p>There are people, though, who are in the dark of night because they have convinced themselves that there was another god, eternally begotten, who came down and redeemed humankind. These people close their eyes to these divine sayings, and consider with eyes shut how to twist the sayings and apply them to their false beliefs. </p>

83. The idea that a Son born from eternity came down and took upon Himself human form collapses as totally erroneous and is exploded on considering the passages from the Word in which Jehovah Himself says that He is the Saviour and Redeemer, as the following:<p>Am I not Jehovah, and there is no God beside Me? There is no righteous God and Saviour beside Me, <a href="3927/isaiah_45_21.htm">Isaiah 45:21-22</a>.<p>I am Jehovah, and there is no Saviour beside Me, <a href="3927/isaiah_43_11.htm">Isaiah 43:11</a>.<p>I am Jehovah your God, and you are not to acknowledge any God beside Me, and there is no Saviour beside Me, <a href="3927/hosea_13_4.htm">Hosea 13:4</a>.<p>That all flesh may know that I am Jehovah your Saviour and your Redeemer, <a href="3927/isaiah_49_26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_60_16.htm">60:16</a>.<p>As for our Redeemer, Jehovah Zebaoth is His name, <a href="3927/isaiah_47_4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a>.<p>Their Redeemer, the mighty Jehovah Zebaoth is His name, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_34.htm">Jeremiah 50:34</a>.<p>Jehovah, my rock and my Redeemer, <a href="3927/psalms_19_14.htm">Psalms 19:14</a>.<p>Thus spoke Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, I am Jehovah your God, <a href="3927/isaiah_48_17.htm">Isaiah 48:17</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_43_14.htm">43:14</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_49_7.htm">49:7</a>.<p>Thus spoke Jehovah, your Redeemer; I am Jehovah who makes all things, and I alone by Myself, <a href="3927/isaiah_44_24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>.<p>Thus spoke Jehovah, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, Jehovah Zebaoth; I am the First and the Last, and there is no God beside me, <a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>.<p>You are Jehovah our Father, our Redeemer from of old is your name, <a href="3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>.<p>I will take pity with eternal mercy, thus spoke your Redeemer Jehovah, <a href="3927/isaiah_54_8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>. You had redeemed me, Jehovah of truth, <a href="3927/psalms_31_5.htm">Psalms 31:5</a>.<p>Let Israel hope in Jehovah, for there is mercy with Jehovah, with Him is very much redemption. He shall redeem Israel from all his sins, <a href="3927/psalms_130_7.htm">Psalms 130:7-8</a>.<p>Jehovah Zebaoth <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
is His name, and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel; He shall be called the God of all the earth, <a href="3927/isaiah_54_5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>.<p>From these and very many more passages anyone who has eyes, and a mind opened by using his eyes, can see that God, who is one, came down and was made man in order to effect redemption. Can anyone fail to see this as clear as in morning light, so long as he pays attention to those very sayings of God which have been quoted? Those, however, who are plunged in the shades of night as the result of convincing themselves that a second God was born from eternity, and that it was He who came down and redeemed us, close their eyes to those Divine sayings, and ponder with their eyes shut how to pervert them and make them square with their false ideas.<p>

Sic dixit JEHOVAH Rex Israelis, et REDEMPTOR EJUS JEHOVAH ZEBAOTH, Ego Primus et Ultimus, et praeter Me non Deus, <a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Esaias 44:6</a>. TU JEHOVAH Pater noster, REDEMPTOR NOSTER a saeculo Nomen tuum, <a href="3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">Esaias 63:16</a>. Cum misericordia aeternitatis miserebor, sic dixit REDEMPTOR TUUS JEHOVAH, <a href="3927/isaiah_54_8.htm">Esaias 54:8</a>. REDEMERAS me JEHOVAH VERITATIS, <a href="3927/psalms_31_6.htm">Psalm 31:6</a>. <sup "fn120_7">7</sup>
Speret Israel in JEHOVAH, quia cum JEHOVAH Misericordia, plurima cum Ipso REDEMPTIO; Ille REDIMET Israelem ab omnibus iniquitatibus ejus, <a href="3927/psalms_130_7.htm">Psalm 130:7-8</a>. JEHOVAH ZEBAOTH nomen Ipsius, <sup "fn120_8">8</sup>
et REDEMPTOR TUUS Sanctus Israelis, DEUS TOTIUS TERRAE VOCABITUR, <a href="3927/isaiah_54_5.htm">Esaias 54:5</a>. Ex his locis et perplurimis aliis, omnis homo, cui oculi, et Mens per oculos aperta est, videre potest, quod Deus, qui unus est, descenderit, et Homo factus sit, propter finem, ut Redemptionem ageret; quis hoc non videre potest ut in luce matutina, dum attendit ad ipsa illa effata Divina, quae adducta sunt: at vero qui in umbra noctis sunt ex confirmatione pro nativitate alterius Dei ab aeterno, ac de hujus descensu et Redemptione, illi ad Divina illa Effata claudunt palpebras, et sub illis cogitant, quomodo illa applicent ad sua falsa et pervertant.<p>
