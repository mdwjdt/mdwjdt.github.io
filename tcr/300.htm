<h3 align="center" class="ired">《真实的基督教》 第300节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>300</b>.在灵界，人“名”不仅仅指他的名字，还指他的一切品质，这一点从名字的使用明显可知。凡在灵界者都不再使用在世受洗时所接受、或出于其父、先祖的名字，每个人都根据其品质而得名，天人则根据其道德和属灵的生活而得名。这就是主说这些话的意思：<br />耶稣说：“我是好牧人。羊听祂的声音，祂按着名叫自己的羊，把羊领出来”。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.3.htm">约翰福音10:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.11.htm">11</a>）<br />在撒狄，我有几个名字，他们还未曾玷污自己的衣服。得胜的，我要将新耶路撒冷城的名，并我的新名，都写在他上面。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.4.htm">启示录3:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.12.htm">12</a>）<br />“迦百列”和“米迦勒”并非天上两个人的名字，这些名字指的是天堂中所有天人，他们拥有关于主的智慧并敬拜祂。圣言中的人名与地名也并非表示人和地方，而表示教会事物。即使在世间，“名字”也并非仅表示人名，也表示这人的品质，因为品质与名字难以分开。在日常交谈中，我们习惯说：“他为了名或为了他的名声这样做”或“这人大名鼎鼎”，意思是他因着所拥有的品质而着名，例如才华、博学、成就等等。众所周知，人若贬损和诽谤某个人的名字，就是在贬损和诽谤他的生活方式。这二者在观念上是连在一起的，他的名声因此被毁。同样，人若以大不敬的方式说出一个国王、贵族或伟人的名字，也是在羞辱他的权威和尊严。再如，人若以轻蔑的语气提及另一个人的名字，同时也是看不起他的生活方式。这适用于所有人。所有国家的法律都禁止诽谤和侮辱人的名字，因为名字等同于他的品质和名声。</p>

<h4 align="center">真实的基督教 #300 </h4>
<p>
300. 心靈世界之中, "名"的意義並非僅指誰的名字, 而是某人的全部品性如何。在那世界中, 他們不再使用在世受洗時以及父母或家庭所賜之名, 而是每個人按其品性另被取名。天人們獲得一個適合他們道德與靈性生活狀態的名字。這些就是主在以下經文中所指:
<p>耶穌說:"我是好牧人。羊聽祂的聲音, 祂按著名叫自己的羊, 把羊領出來"(<a href="3927/john_10_3.htm">約翰福音10:3</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_11.htm">11</a>)。在撒狄, 我有幾個名字, 他們還未曾玷污自己的衣服。得勝的, 我要將新耶路撒冷城的名, 並我的新名, 都寫在他上面(<a href="3927/revelation_3_4.htm">啟示錄3:4</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_3_12.htm">12</a>)。
<p>"迦百利"和"米迦勒"並非天上兩個人的名字, 這些名字指的是天國中所有的天人, 他們擁有關於主的智慧並敬拜祂。聖言中的人名與地名也並非表示某人與某地方, 它們都表示教會的某方面事情。
<p>即使在人間, "名"所表示的也超過僅僅名字的意義, 也表示某人的特徵品性, 人的品性特徵與其名難以分開。我們常說:"人如其名"或"名實相稱", 是指人所擁有的品性確實如此, 例如其人的心靈手巧,滿腹經綸,成績斐然, 等等。
<p>大家當知道, 人若以其名來羞辱和誹謗某人, 他也是在羞辱和誹謗他的生命。這兩個概念是相通的, 這是在毀壞他名的聲譽。同理, 人若以不尊重的方式來說某君王,公爵或偉人的名字, 也是在羞辱此人的權威和尊嚴。若任何人以輕蔑的語調說某人的名字, 同時也是對此人的生命狀態嗤之以鼻, 這適用於任何人。每個國家都立法禁止人們去誹謗和侮辱任何人的名字, 因為名字與其人的屬性和名聲是等同的。 </p>

300. The nature of names in the spiritual world makes it clear that someone's "name" does not mean her or his name alone but also her or his full nature. In that world, people all stop using the names they were given in baptism in this world and the names they received from their parents or their family. All there are named for what they are like. Angels get a name that indicates the moral and spiritual life they have. In fact, the Lord was referring to angels in the following passage:
<p>Jesus said, "I am the good shepherd. The sheep hear the shepherds voice and he calls his sheep by name and leads them out. " (<a href="3927/john_10_3.htm">John 10:3</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_11.htm">11</a>)
<p>The same holds true in the following passage:
<p>I have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their clothes. Upon the person who conquers I will write the name of the city New Jerusalem and my new name. (<a href="3927/revelation_3_4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_3_12.htm">12</a>)
<p>"Gabriel" and "Michael" are not the names of two people in heaven - these names mean all the angels in heaven who have wisdom about the Lord and who worship him. The names of people and places in the Word do not mean people and places either; they mean aspects of the church.
<p>Even in our world a "name" means more than just a name - it also means what someone is like. People's natures get attached to their names. We often say, "They're doing it for their name" or "to make a name for themselves. " "Those are big names" means that those people are famous for characteristics they possess, such as creativity, scholarship, achievements, or the like.
<p>It is common knowledge that people who insult or libel other people's names are in fact insulting or libeling the actions of the other people's lives. The two are conceptually linked. Such attacks ruin the reputation of people's names. Likewise, someone who says the name of a monarch, a duke, or a great person with disrespect also dishonors the person's majesty and dignity. It is equally true that someone who mentions anyone's name with a tone of contempt also disparages the deeds of that person's life-this applies to everyone. Every country has laws that forbid us to abuse, attack, or insult anyone's name (meaning anyone's nature and reputation). </p>

300. The names used in the spiritual world make it plain that someone's name does not mean just his name, but his whole character. In that world no one keeps the name he received at baptism and from his father or family in the world, but everyone there is named to suit his character, and angels have names to suit their moral and spiritual lives. It is these whom the Lord meant when He said:<p>I am the good shepherd. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out, <a href="3927/john_10_3.htm">John 10:3</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_11.htm">11</a>.<p>Likewise by these words:<p>You <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their clothes. As for him who has overcome, I will write upon him the name of the city of the New Jerusalem, and my new name, <a href="3927/revelation_3_4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_3_12.htm">12</a>.<p>Gabriel and Michael are not the names of two people in heaven, but those names mean everyone in heaven who possesses wisdom about the Lord and worships Him. The names of persons and places in the Word too do not mean actual people and places, but matters which concern the church.</p>
<p>
[2] Even in the natural world a name does not mean just the name, but at the same time a person's whole character, since this is inseparable from the name. In ordinary speech we say, 'He is doing this for the sake of his name', or 'for the sake of the reputation of his name'; or 'this man has a famous name.' We mean by this that he is famous for qualities he possesses, such as ingenuity, learning, achievements, and so on. Everyone knows that if anyone insults and slanders someone by name, he is also insulting and slandering the way he lives. The ideas are linked, so that the reputation of his name is destroyed. In much the same way, if anyone utters the name of a king, duke or high dignitary in an insulting fashion, he heaps abuse also on their majesty and dignity. Equally, if anyone pronounces a person's name in a contemptuous tone, he at the same time shows his contempt for the way he lives. It is the same with every person; the laws of all kingdoms forbid a person's name to be slandered or insulted, because the name is equivalent to his character and reputation.<p>

300. That the name of anyone means not his name alone but his every quality, is evident from the use of names in the spiritual world. <p>No man there retains the name he received in baptism, or that of his father or ancestry in the world; but everyone is there named according to his character, and angels are named according to their moral and spiritual life. Such are meant in these words of the Lord: <p>Jesus said, I am the Good Shepherd. The sheep hear His voice, and He calleth His own sheep by name and leadeth them out (<a href="3927/john_10_11.htm">John 10:11</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_3.htm">3</a>). <p>Also in these words: <p>Thou hast a few names even in Sardis, that have not defiled their garments. He that overcometh, I will write upon him the name of the city New Jerusalem, and My new name (<a href="3927/revelation_3_4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_3_12.htm">12</a>). <p>Gabriel and Michael are not the names of two persons in heaven, but by those names all in heaven who are in wisdom respecting the Lord, and who worship Him are meant. The names of persons and of places in the Word do not mean persons and places, but the things of the church. Nor in the natural world does a name mean the person's name only, but his character also, because this adheres to his name; for in common conversation it is customary to say, "This he does for the sake of his name," or "for the fame of his name," or "this man has a great name," meaning that he is celebrated, for such things as are in him, as for talents, erudition, merits, and so on. Who does not know that he who disparages and calumniates anyone in name, also disparages and calumniates the actions of his life? In idea the two are joined together, and the fame of his name is thus destroyed. In like manner one who utters the name of a king, a noble, or any great man, with great disrespect, also casts opprobrium upon his majesty and dignity. So again he who mentions the name of another in a tone of contempt, at the same time belittles the acts of his life. This is true of everyone. According to the laws of all kingdoms it is not lawful to sully and wound with slander anyone's name, that is, his character and consequent reputation. </p>

300. The name of anyone means not only his name but also his whole characteristic quality, as is evident from names in the spiritual world. There no man retains the name which he received in this world at baptism, or from his father and ancestry; but everyone is named according to his characteristic quality, and so angels are named according to their moral and spiritual life. These also are meant by these words of the Lord:<p>Jesus said, "I am the good shepherd... the sheep hear His voice, and He calleth His own sheep by name, and leadeth them out" <a href="3927/john_10_3.htm">John 10:3</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_11.htm">11</a>.<p>The same are meant in this passage:<p>"I have (A.V., thou hast) a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments... I will write upon him that overcometh... the name of the city, New Jerusalem... and my new name" <a href="3927/revelation_3_4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_3_12.htm">12</a>.<p>Gabriel and Michael <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
are not the names of two persons in heaven; but by these names are meant all those in heaven who are in wisdom concerning the Lord, and who worship Him.<p>The names also of persons and places in the Word do not mean persons and places, but things of the Church. Moreover, in the natural world a name does not mean the name only, but also the character of the person, because this is intimately associated with his name. For in common speech it is said of one man that he does this or that for the sake of his name, or for the reputation of his name; of another, that he has a good name, by which is meant that he is renowned for qualities that are in him, as natural ability, learning, merits, and so on. Everyone knows that he who reviles and slanders any as to his name, also reviles and slanders the actions of his life. These are associated in idea, and consequently the reputation of his name is destroyed. Similarly he who treats with ignominy the name of king, duke and potentate, casts opprobrium upon their majesty and dignity. In like manner he who employs a contemptuous tone in uttering the name of anyone, contemns at the same time the actions of his life. As this happens in the case of everyone, there is a general law in all nations forbidding the abuse and vilification of a person's name, as this involves his character and reputation.<p>
