773. The purpose of the Lord's Coming is to form a new heaven made up of people who have believed in him, and to establish a new church made up of people from now on who believe in him. These are the two goals of his Coming. His ultimate purpose in creating the universe was exactly this: to form an angelic heaven made up of people. In this heaven, all who believe in God will live in eternal bliss. The divine love that God has, and that is his essence, cannot intend anything other than this, and the divine wisdom that God has, and that is God, cannot produce any other outcome than this.
<p>The universe was created for the purpose of having an angelic heaven made up of members of the human race, and also for the purpose of having a church in the world, since the church gives the human race access to heaven. In addition, saving people, which requires that they be born in the world, is itself an ongoing act of creation. For this reason the Word sometimes uses the word "create," and means by it "forming people for heaven. " See, for example, the following passages.
</p>
<p>
[2] Create for me a clean heart, O God, and renew a firm spirit within me. (<a href="3927/psalms_51_10.htm">Psalms 51:10</a>)
<p>You open your hand, and they are filled with goodness. You send forth your spirit, and they are created. (<a href="3927/psalms_104_28.htm">Psalms 104:28</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_104_30.htm">30</a>)
<p>The people who are yet to be created will praise Jah. (<a href="3927/psalms_102_18.htm">Psalms 102:18</a>)
<p>Thus says Jehovah, the one who created you, O Jacob; the one who formed you, O Israel: "I have redeemed you. I have called you by my name; you [are mine]. All who are called by my name I have created for my glory. " (<a href="3927/isaiah_43_1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_43_7.htm">7</a>)
<p>They were prepared [for you] on the day you were created. You were perfect in your ways on the day you were created, until perverseness was found in you. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_15.htm">15</a>)
<p>This statement concerns the king of Tyre.
<p>. . . so that they may see, recognize, consider, and understand that the hand of Jehovah has done this and the Holy One of Israel has created it. (<a href="3927/isaiah_41_20.htm">Isaiah 41:20</a>)
<p>From the passages just quoted, it becomes clear what creating means in the following passages.
<p>Jehovah is the one who creates the heavens, stretches out the earth, and gives life to the people upon it, and spirit to those who walk on it. (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_45_12.htm">45:12</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_45_18.htm">18</a>)
<p>Behold, I am creating a new heaven and a new earth. Enjoy forever what I am creating. Behold, I am going to create Jerusalem as a rejoicing. (<a href="3927/isaiah_65_17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-18</a>) </p>

773. The Lord's coming is for the formation of a new heaven from those who have believed in Him, and to inaugurate a new church from those who believe in Him from now on; these are the two purposes in His coming. The purpose of the actual creation of the universe was none other than the formation of a heaven of angels from human beings, one where all who believe in God might live in everlasting blessedness. For the Divine love, which is in God and in essence is God, could have no other aim; nor could the Divine wisdom, which is also in God and is God, produce any other result. It is because the creation of the universe had as its purpose a heaven of angels formed from the human race, and at the same time a church on earth, as the means by which a person may pass into heaven, and because the salvation of people, which depends upon people being born in the world, is thus a continuation of creation, that the Word in many passages speaks of creating, by which is meant forming for heaven; for example, in the following:<p>Create for me, God, a clean heart, and make new a steadfast spirit within me, <a href="3927/psalms_51_10.htm">Psalms 51:10</a>.<p>You open your hand, and they are filled with good; you send forth your spirit, and they are created, <a href="3927/psalms_104_28.htm">Psalms 104:28</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_104_30.htm">30</a>.<p>The people who are going to be created will praise Jah, <a href="3927/psalms_102_18.htm">Psalms 102:18</a>.<p>Thus spoke Jehovah your Creator, Jacob, who formed you, Israel. I have redeemed you, I have called you by your <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
name, you are mine. Everyone who is called by my name, I have created him to my glory, <a href="3927/isaiah_43_1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_43_7.htm">7</a>.<p>They were prepared on the day you were created. You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, until perversity was found in you, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_15.htm">15</a>.<p>This is said of the king of Tyre.<p>So that they may see, know, attend and understand, that the hand of Jehovah has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created this, <a href="3927/isaiah_41_20.htm">Isaiah 41:20</a>.<p>From these passages it can be clear what create means in the following:<p>Jehovah creating the heavens and spreading out the earth, giving breath to the people upon it, and spirit to those that walk upon it, <a href="3927/isaiah_42_5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_45_12.htm">45:12</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_45_18.htm">18</a>.<p>Behold, I create a new heaven and a new earth. Rejoice for ever, what I am creating. Behold, I shall make Jerusalem an exultation, <a href="3927/isaiah_65_17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-18</a>.<p>

773. The Lord's coming is for the purpose of forming a new heaven of those who have believed in Him, and for the purpose of establishing a new church of those who shall hereafter believe in Him, inasmuch as these two are the ends for which He came. The very end for which the universe was created was no other than the formation from men of an angelic heaven, where all who believe in God shall live forever in eternal blessedness; for the Divine love which is in God and essentially is God, can intend nothing else, and the Divine wisdom which is also in God and is God, can effect nothing else. As the end for which the universe was created was an angelic heaven from the human race, and at the same time a church on earth (for man enters heaven through the church); and as the salvation of men (which is to be effected in men who are to be born in the world), is thus the continuation of creation, so throughout the Word the term "to create," which is frequently used, means to form for heaven, as in the following passages: <p>Create for me a clean heart, O God, and renew a firm spirit in the midst of me (<a href="3927/psalms_51_10.htm">Psalms 51:10</a>). <p>Thou openest Thine hand, they are satisfied with good; Thou sendest forth Thy Spirit, they are created (<a href="3927/psalms_104_28.htm">Psalms 104:28</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_104_30.htm">30</a>). <p>A people that shall be created shall praise Jah (<a href="3927/psalms_102_18.htm">Psalms 102:18</a>). <p>Thus hath said Jehovah thy Creator, O Jacob, and thy Former, O Israel; I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name, thou art Mine. Everyone that is called by My name into My glory have I created him (<a href="3927/isaiah_43_1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_43_7.htm">7</a>). <p>In the day that thou wast created they were prepared. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_15.htm">15</a>). <p>This is said of the king of Tyre: <p>That they may see, know, consider and understand that the hand of Jehovah hath done it, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it (<a href="3927/isaiah_41_20.htm">Isaiah 41:20</a>). <p>From all this the meaning of the term "to create" in the following passages can be seen: <p>Jehovah creating the heavens, spreading forth the earth, giving breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk in it (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_45_12.htm">45:12</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_45_18.htm">18</a>). <p>Behold I create a new heaven and a new earth; be ye glad forever in that which I create; for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing (<a href="3927/isaiah_65_17.htm">Isaiah 65:17, 18</a>). </p>

He that spread forth the earth... He that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein" <a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_45_12.htm">45:12</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_45_18.htm">18</a>.<p>"Behold, I create a new heaven and a new earth: Be ye glad... for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing" <a href="3927/isaiah_65_17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-18</a>. </p>

Quod Adventus Domini sit ad formandum novum Coelum ex illis qui crediderunt in Ipsum, et ad instaurandum novam Ecclesiam ex illis qui posthac in Ipsum credunt, est quia illa duo sunt fines Adventus Ipsius: ipse finis creationis Universi nec fuit alius, quam ut ex hominibus formaretur Coelum Angelicum, in quo omnes qui in Deum credunt, victuri sint in beatitudine aeterna, Divinus enim Amor, qui est in Deo et essentialiter Deus, non aliud potest intendere, et Divina Sapientia, quae etiam est in Deo et Deus, nec aliud potest producere.
