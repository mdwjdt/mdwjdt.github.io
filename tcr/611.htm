611. The More We Are Regenerated, the More Our Sins Are Laid Aside; This Relocating of Them Is the "Forgiving of Sins"
<p>The more we are regenerated, the more our sins are laid aside, because the process of being regenerated is a matter of restraining our flesh so that it does not control us, and taming our old self and its cravings so that it does not rise up and destroy our intellectual faculty. Once our intellectual faculty is destroyed we can no longer be reformed; this reformation cannot take place unless our spirit, which is above our flesh, is instructed and perfected.
<p>Surely everyone (whose intellect is still intact) can see from what was just stated that this sort of process cannot be completed in a moment. It happens in stages, much the way we are conceived, carried in the womb, born, and brought up, as was presented above. The traits of the flesh or the old self are embedded in us from the day we are born. They build the first home for our mind. Cravings live in that home like predatory animals in their dens. At first they live in the entryways. Then bit by bit they move by stealth into levels of the house that are below ground. Later on they go upstairs and make bedrooms for themselves there. This takes place gradually as we grow up from our childhood through youth to young adulthood, when we begin to have thoughts that come from our own understanding and perform actions that come from our own will.
</p>
<p>
[2] Surely everyone can see that the home that has been established in our mind to this point - a place where cravings join hands and dance with each other like owls, wild beasts of the desert, and satyrs [<a href="3927/isaiah_13_21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_34_13.htm">34:13-15</a>] - cannot be torn down in a single moment and a new home constructed in its place. First the cravings that are holding hands and dancing have to be set to one side, and new healthy desires for what is good and true need to be brought in to replace our unhealthy desires for what is evil and false.
<p>All this cannot happen in a moment. Every wise person can see the truth of this just from the fact that each evil is composed of countless cravings. Every evil is like a piece of fruit that under its skin is full of worms with black heads and white bodies. There are a great number of such evils and they are joined to each other, like a spider's offspring when they first hatch out of its belly. Therefore unless one evil after another is taken away until their confederation is broken up, we cannot become a new person.
<p>These things have been stated to support the point that the more we are regenerated, the more our sins are laid aside. </p>

611. X. In so far as a person is regenerated, so far are his sins removed; this removal is the forgiveness of sins.<p>The reason why so far as a person is regenerated, so far are his sins removed, is that regeneration consists in controlling the flesh so that it does not take control, in taming the former man and his lusts so that he cannot rise again and destroy the faculty of understanding; for if this is destroyed, there is no further possibility of the person being reformed. This reformation cannot occur, unless the person's spirit, which is above the flesh, is instructed and advanced towards perfection. No one, whose understanding is still unimpaired, can fail to conclude from this that such events cannot take place in an instant, but do so one after another, just as a person is conceived, carried in the womb, born and brought up, in the sequence demonstrated above. The properties belonging to the flesh or the former man are inherent from birth. They build the first home for his mind, the dwelling-place of lusts, which are like wild beasts in their cages. They live at first in the forecourts, and little by little creep into the rooms of that house below ground level, and afterwards climb the stairs and make rooms for themselves. This happens by stages as the child grows, becomes a boy and then a youth; then he begins to use his own understanding to think and his own will to act.</p>
<p>
[2] Anyone can see that a house built thus far in the mind, where lusts like ochim, ghoim <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
and satyrs hold hands to dance, cannot be destroyed in a moment, and a new house built in its place. Of course the lusts holding hands and so disporting themselves must first be banished, and new desires for good and truth be brought in to replace the lusts for evil and falsity. Any wise person can see that such things cannot take place in an instant from the single consideration, that every evil is the product of countless lusts, resembling a fruit that below the surface is full of maggots with black heads and white bodies. Evils too, he will realise, are numerous and closely linked, like the offspring of a spider just hatched from its belly. So unless one evil after another is brought out, and the process continues until the link is broken, a person cannot become new. These considerations have been presented in order to make it known that in so far as anyone is regenerated, so far are his sins removed.<p>

611. X. SO FAR AS MAN IS REGENERATED SINS ARE REMOVED, AND THIS REMOVAL IS THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. <p>So far as man is regenerated sins are removed, because regeneration is the restraining of the flesh that it may not rule, and the subjugating of the old man with its lusts, that it may not rise up and destroy the intellectual faculty, for that would render man incapable of reformation, reformation being impossible unless man's spirit, which is above the flesh, is instructed and perfected. Who, if he still retains a sound understanding, can fail to see from all this that such a work cannot be effected in a moment but only gradually, just as man is conceived, carried in the womb, born, and educated, according to what has been shown above? For those things which pertain to the flesh or the old man are inherent in man from his birth, and build the first habitation of his mind, in which lusts have their abode like wild beasts in their caves, dwelling first in the outer courts, then by turns entering into the underground rooms, as it were, of the house, and finally ascending by steps and forming for themselves chambers. This takes place gradually, as an infant grows, becomes a boy, afterwards a youth, and then begins to think from his own understanding, and to act from his own will. Who cannot see that this house in the mind thus far built in which lusts dance with joined hands, like the ochim, tziim and satyrs, cannot be destroyed in a moment and a new house built in its place? Must not those lusts with clasped hands and so sporting themselves be first removed, and new desires, which belong to good and truth, be introduced in the place of the cupidities which belong to evil and falsity? That these things cannot be done in a moment every wise man sees from this alone, that every evil is composed of innumerable lusts, and is like a fruit which beneath the surface is full of worms with white bodies and black heads; also, that evils are numerous and joined together like the progeny of a spider when first hatched; wherefore unless one evil is brought out after another, and this until their connection is broken up, man cannot be made new. These things have been cited to make clear that so far as anyone is regenerated sins are removed. </p>

611. X. AS FAR AS A MAN IS REGENERATED, HIS SINS ARE REMOVED; AND THIS REMOVAL IS THE REMISSION OF SINS.<p>Sins are removed so far as a man is regenerated. For regeneration consists in restraining the flesh so that it may not rule, and in subduing the old man with its lusts that it may not rise and destroy the intellectual principle; because if this were destroyed a man would no longer be capable of reformation. For reformation cannot take place unless a man's spirit, which is above the flesh, is instructed and perfected. Any one whose understanding is still sound, may, therefore, conclude that these things cannot take place in a moment, but must proceed gradually, just as a man is conceived, carried in the womb, born and educated, according to what was shown above. For the things of the flesh, or of the old man, are inherent from birth, and form the first habitation of his mind, in which dwell lusts, like wild beasts in their dens. These first take up their abode in the outer courts, from which they gradually enter, as it were, underground rooms of the house, and afterwards ascend the stairs and form rooms for themselves. This takes place gradually as the infant grows up, becomes a boy and at length a young man, when he begins to think from his own understanding and to act from his own will.<p>It must be evident that this house of the mind, thus far advanced in the building, where lusts like lewd spirits of the wood (ochim), harpies of the desert (tziim), and satyrs join hands in sportive dance, cannot be destroyed in a moment, and a new house built in its place. The lusts, like revelers sporting hand in hand, must first be expelled and new desires of good and truth be introduced in place of those which belong to evil and falsity. These things cannot be done in a moment as every wise man may see from merely considering that every evil consists of innumerable lusts, and is like fruit which, underneath the surface, is full of worms with white bodies and black heads; and that evils are manifold, and linked together like the newly hatched progeny of a spider. Unless, therefore, evils are expelled one after another, and every tie that would hold them together is broken, it is impossible for a man to be made new. These things have keen recorded that it may be evident that so far as a man is regenerated his sins are removed. </p>
