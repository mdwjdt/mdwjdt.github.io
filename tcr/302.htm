<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>302</b>.就属灵之义而言，这条诫命表示人经主的改造与重生。“六日劳碌”表示与肉体及其情欲的争战，同时表示与恶和假争战，它们通过地狱被植入人内。“第七日”则表示人与主结合，并因此重生。在下文有关改造与重生的章节将说明，只要这样的争战继续，人就忙于属灵的劳碌；但当他重生后，就可安息。在此将这些重点列出来：<br />①重生类似一个人的受孕、在子宫内孕育、出生和接受教育。②新生的第一步就是所谓的改造，这一过程涉及理解力；第二步则是所谓的重生，这一过程涉及意愿，并由此涉及理解力。③内在人必须先被改造，然后外在人通过内在人被改造。④此时，内在人与外在人会进行争战，得胜的这一方会主宰另一方。⑤重生者会有一个新意愿和一个新理解力等等。<br />就属灵之义而言，这条诫命象征人的改造与重生，因为它们与主的劳碌、与地狱的争战、胜过地狱和随之而来的安息是一致的。主改造和重生人，使之变得属灵的方式，与祂荣耀祂的人身，使之为圣的方式是一样的。这就是“跟从祂”这一命令的含义。主有争战，它们被称为劳碌，这一点可从《以赛亚书》（53和63章）明显看出来。论及人时，类似的事也被称为“劳碌”，这一点可从《以赛亚书》（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.23.htm">65:23</a>）和《启示录》（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.2.htm">2:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.3.htm">3</a>）明显看出来。</p>

302. 就屬靈之義而言, 此誡表示人經主的改造與更新。"六日勞苦"表示與肉身及其欲望的爭戰, 同時也是與(地獄灌輸於人的)邪惡和偽謬爭戰。"第七日"則表示人與主連接並因此而更新。只要這樣的爭戰持續, 我們就會有屬靈的勞苦; 然後我們一旦被更新, 就可安息。這可從之後關於改造與更新的章節明顯看出(<a href="571.htm">571-625</a>節), 特別是那裡討論的以下觀點:
<p>(1)更新的過程類似於一個人的受孕,在子宮內孕育,出生及成長。
<p>(2)更新的第一階段被稱為認知的改造, 第二階段是意志的更新並因而認知的更新。
<p>(3)內在人必須先被改造, 接著外在人藉著內在人被改造。
<p>(4)此時會在內外人與外在人之間產生鬥爭, 勝方成為敗方的主人(一方控制另一方)。
<p>(5)當一人被更新後, 就有了新的意志和新的認知。
<p>為何說這條誡命的屬靈意義是指人的改造與更新？因為類似於主的勞累及與地獄的爭戰, 以及祂勝過地獄, 然後安息了。並且, 主榮耀祂降世所取之人並使其成為神性的方式, 與祂改造和更新人,使其成為屬靈的方式雷同。這就是"跟從祂"的意義所在。從<a href="3927/isaiah_53_1.htm">以賽亞書53</a>和<a href="3927/isaiah_63_1.htm">63</a>章可明顯看出, 主所行的爭戰被稱為勞苦; 類似的, 人所做的被稱為勞苦(或勞碌)(<a href="3927/isaiah_65_23.htm">以賽亞書65:23</a>;<a href="3927/revelation_2_2.htm">啟示錄2:2-3</a>)。 </p>

302. In the spiritual meaning, this commandment refers to our being reformed and regenerated by the Lord. The six days of labor mean battling against the flesh and its cravings and also against the evils and falsities that are in us from hell. The seventh day means our becoming connected to the Lord and our being regenerated as a result. As long as this battle continues, we have spiritual labor; but when we have been regenerated, we rest. This will become clear from the points that will be made below in the chapter on reformation and regeneration [571-625] - especially the following points that are discussed there: (1) Regeneration progresses analogously to the way we are conceived, carried in the womb, born, and brought up. (2) The first phase in our being generated anew is called "reformation;" it has to do with our intellect. The second phase is called "regeneration;" it has to do with our will and then our intellect. (3) Our inner self has to be reformed first. Our outer self is then reformed through our inner self. (4) Then a battle develops between our inner and outer self. Whichever self wins, it will control the other. (5) When we have been regenerated, we have a new will and a new intellect. And so on.
<p>In the spiritual meaning, this commandment refers to our reformation and regeneration because these processes parallel the Lord's labors and battles against the hells, his victory over them, and then rest. The way he glorified his human manifestation and made it divine is the same way he reforms and regenerates us and makes us spiritual. This is what is meant by following him. The battles of the Lord are called labors, and were labors, as is clear from Isaiah 53 and 63. Similar things are called labors in us (<a href="3927/isaiah_65_23.htm">Isaiah 65:23</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_2_2.htm">Revelation 2:2-3</a>). </p>

302. In the spiritual sense this commandment means man's reformation and regeneration by the Lord. 'Six days of work' means the fight against the flesh and its lusts, and at the same time against the evils and falsities which are implanted in one by hell. The seventh day means his being linked with the Lord, and his consequent regeneration. It will be shown later on, in the chapter on reformation and regeneration, that, so long as that fight continues, a person is engaged in spiritual labour; but when he is regenerated, he has rest. The important points made there are these:<p>(i) Regeneration is an exact replica of a person's conception, gestation in the womb, birth and training.<p>(ii) The first act of a new birth is called the reformation of the understanding, its second act is the regeneration of the will and hence of the understanding.<p>(iii) The internal man must first be reformed, and the external man by means of the internal.<p>(iv) At that time a struggle takes place between the internal and external man; the one who wins becomes master over the other.<p>(v) A person's regeneration is having a new will and a new understanding, etc.<p>The reason why this commandment in the spiritual sense means a person's reformation and regeneration is that it parallels the Lord's toils and battles with the hells, and His victory over them, followed by rest. For the way in which the Lord glorified His Human and made it Divine is the same as the way in which He reforms man and regenerates him, making him spiritual. This is what is meant by 'following Him'. This is plain from Isaiah chapters 53 and 63 that the Lord engaged in battles and these are called toils; and similar events with men are called toils (<a href="3927/isaiah_65_23.htm">Isaiah 65:23</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_2_2.htm">Revelation 2:2-3</a>). </p>

302. In the spiritual sense, this commandment signifies man's reformation and regeneration by the Lord, "the six days of labor" signifying his warfare against the flesh and its lusts, and at the same time against the evils and falsities that are in him from hell, and "the seventh day" signifying his conjunction with the Lord, and regeneration thereby. That man's spiritual labor continues as long as that warfare lasts, but when he is regenerated he has rest, will be shown in what is to be said hereafter in the chapter on Reformation and Regeneration, especially under the following sections there: <p>(1) Regeneration is effected in a manner analogous to that in which man is conceived, carried in a womb, born, and educated <p>(2) The first act in the new birth is called reformation, which belongs to the understanding; and the second is called regeneration, which belongs to the will and therefrom to the understanding. <p>(3) The internal man is to be reformed first, and through that the external. <p>(4) Then a conflict arises between the internal and the external man, and the one that conquers rules the other. <p>(5) The regenerate man has a new will, and a new understanding; and so forth. <p>The reformation and regeneration of man are signified by this commandment in the spiritual sense, because they coincide with the labors and combats of the Lord with the hells, and with His victory over them, and the rest that followed. For the Lord reforms and regenerates man and renders him spiritual in the same manner in which He glorified His Human and made it Divine; and this is the meaning of the command to "follow Him." That the Lord had combats, which are called "labors," is evident from<a href="3927/isaiah_53_1.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_63_1.htm">63</a>; and that like things are called "labors" in reference to men, from<a href="3927/isaiah_65_23.htm">Isaiah 65:23</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_2_2.htm">Revelation 51:2-3</a>. </p>

302. This commandment in the spiritual sense signifies the reformation and regeneration of man by the Lord. The six days of labor signify man's combat against the flesh and its lusts, and, at the same time, against the evils and falsities that are in him from hell; while the seventh day signifies his conjunction with the Lord, and consequent regeneration. That during this combat man undergoes spiritual labor, but enters into rest when he is regenerated, will appear from what is said in a later chapter on Reformation and Regeneration, particularly under these headings:<p>(1) Regeneration takes place in a manner like that in which a man is conceived, carried in the womb, born and educated.<p>(2) The first step of the new birth is called reformation, which is of the understanding; and the second is called regeneration, which is of the will, and thence of the understanding.<p>(3) The internal man has first to be reformed, and afterwards the external man by means of the internal.<p>(4) A combat then arises between the internal and the external man; and whichever conquers rules over the other.<p>(5) The regenerate man has a new will and a new understanding;<p>and from the rest of the chapter.<p>The reformation and the regeneration of man are signified by this commandment in the spiritual sense because they are analogous to the Lord's labors and combats with the hells, to His victory over them, and to His subsequent rest. For the Lord reforms and regenerates man, and makes him spiritual, in the same way as He glorified His Human and made it Divine. This is what is meant by "following Him." That the Lord had His combats, and that they are called labors, is evident from <a href="3927/isaiah_53_1.htm">Isaiah 53</a> And <a href="3927/isaiah_63_1.htm">63</a>; and that man's struggles are also called labors may be seen in <a href="3927/isaiah_65_23.htm">Isaiah 65:23</a>, and <a href="3927/revelation_2_2.htm">Revelation 2:2-3</a>. </p>

302. Per hoc Praeceptum in SENSU SPIRITUALI significatur hominis Reformatio et Regeneratio a Domino; per sex dies laboris pugna contra carnem et ejus concupiscentias, et simul tunc contra mala et falsa quae apud se ab Inferno sunt; et per diem Septimum significatur ejus conjunctio cum Domino, et per id regeneratio; quod quamdiu pugna illa perstat, sit homini Labor Spiritualis, at quod cum regeneratus est, sit illi Quies, constabit ex illis, quae in Capite de REFORMATIONE ET REGENERATIONE posthac dicentur; imprimis ex his ibi, I. Quod Regeneratio fiat ad instar sicut homo concipitur, gestatur in utero, nascitur, et educatur. II. Quod Primus actus novae Generationis dicatur Reformatio qui est intellectus, et quod Secundus ejus dicatur Regeneratio, qui est Voluntatis et inde intellectus. III. Quod Internus homo primum reformandus sit, et per hunc Externus. IV. Quod tunc pugna inter Internum et Externum hominem oriatur, et quod qui vincit, dominetur super alterum. V. Quod homini Regenerato sit nova Voluntas et novus Intellectus, etc. Quod Reformatio et Regeneratio hominis per hoc Praeceptum in spirituali sensu significetur, est quia coincidit cum laboribus et pugnis Domini cum Infernis, et cum Victoria super illa, et tunc Quiete; nam modo, quo Dominus glorificavit Humanum suum, et illud Divinum fecit, illo etiam reformat et regenerat hominem, et eum spiritualem reddit; hoc est quod intelligitur per SEQUI IPSUM. Quod Pugnae Domino fuerint et dicantur Labores, patet apud <a href="3927/isaiah_53_1.htm">Esajam 53</a> et <a href="3927/isaiah_63_1.htm">63</a>: et quod similia dicantur Labores de hominibus, <a href="3927/isaiah_65_23.htm">Esaias 65:23</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_2_2.htm">Apocalypsis 2:2-3</a>. </p>
