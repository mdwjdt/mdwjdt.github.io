641. In reality, the Lord's merit and justice are purely divine. The nature of purely divine things is such that if they were to be applied or attributed to us, we would instantly die and would be so thoroughly consumed, like a stick thrown into the sun itself, that not even ashes would be left. Therefore when the Lord in all his divinity approaches angels and people, he does so through a light that is tempered and moderated to suit the nature and the faculties of each individual; he works through something fully suited and accommodated to that person. The same is true for the heat through which he makes his approach.
</p>
<p>
[2] In the spiritual world there is a sun. The Lord is in the center of that sun. From it he flows, through heat and light, into the whole spiritual world and into all the people there. All the light and heat there come from that sun. The Lord also flows from that sun, with the same heat and light, into the souls and minds of people [in the material world]. That heat, in its essence, is the Lord's divine love; that light, in its essence, is the Lord's divine wisdom. The Lord adapts that light and heat to the nature and faculties of the angels and people who are receiving him. This takes place through spiritual auras or atmospheres that convey and carry that heat and light. The divine qualities that directly surround the Lord constitute that sun. It stands at a distance from angels, just as the sun in the physical world stands at a distance from people, so that it will not shine on them unprotectedly and directly, because if it did, they would be consumed, as I say, like a stick thrown into the sun itself.
</p>
<p>
[3] All this makes it clear that the Lord's merit and justice, purely divine as they are, could never, ever be brought through any process of assignment into any angel or any person. In fact, without the protections just mentioned, if only one undiluted drop of it were to touch us we would immediately be tormented as if we were fighting for our lives; we would thrash about, our eyes rolling in their sockets, and die. In the Israelite church the truth of this was clear from the statement that no one can see God and live [<a href="3927/exodus_33_20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>].
</p>
<p>
[4] In the following words in Isaiah, there is a description of what was to happen to the sun of the spiritual world after Jehovah God took on a human manifestation and added to it redemption and a new justice:
<p>The light of the sun will be seven times as strong, like the light of seven days, on the day when Jehovah will bind up the brokenness of his people. (<a href="3927/isaiah_30_26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>)
<p>From beginning to end, that chapter is about the Lord's Coming.
<p>In the following words in the Book of Revelation, there is a description of what would happen if the Lord were to come down and directly approach some godless person:
<p>They will hide themselves in caves and in the rocks on the mountains, and they will say to the mountains and the rocks, "Hide us from the face of the One sitting on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb. " (<a href="3927/revelation_6_15.htm">Revelation 6:15-16</a>)
<p>The phrase "the anger of the Lamb" is used here because their terror and torment at the approach of the Lord makes him seem angry to them.
</p>
<p>
[5] The point I am making becomes even clearer from the fact that when any godless people are brought into heaven, where goodwill and faith in the Lord are dominant, darkness comes over their eyes, dizziness and insanity assault their minds, pain and torment afflict their bodies, and they become like dead people. What would happen, then, if the Lord himself were to come into us with his divine merit (which is redemption) and his divine justice? Even the apostle John could not bear the presence of the Lord: we read that when he saw the Son of Humankind among seven lampstands, he fell at his feet as if dead (<a href="3927/revelation_1_13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">17</a>). </p>

641. The Lord's merit and righteousness then are wholly Divine; and what is wholly Divine is such that if applied and attributed to a human being, he would instantly die, and like a block of wood thrown into the unprotected sun would be so thoroughly consumed that hardly a trace of ash would be left. The Lord therefore with His divinity approaches angels and men by means of light tempered and modified to suit the ability and nature of the individual, and so by means of what is matched and rendered suitable; and likewise by means of heat.</p>
<p>
[2] There is a sun in the spiritual world, and the Lord is in its midst. From that sun He spreads His radiation by means of light and heat throughout the spiritual world, and to everyone there. This is the source of all the light and heat there is in that world. From that sun the Lord also radiates the same light and the same heat into the souls and minds of human beings. The heat in its essence is His Divine love, the light in its essence is His Divine wisdom. This light and heat is modified by the Lord to suit the ability and nature of the angel or man receiving it; this is effected by means of spiritual auras or atmospheres, which carry and transmit them. It is the Divine itself immediately surrounding the Lord which composes that sun. It is distanced from the angels, as the sun of the natural world is from men, in order that it should not come into unprotected and close contact with them. For if it did, they would be consumed, like a block of wood thrown into the unprotected sun, as I have said.</p>
<p>
[3] These facts are enough to establish that the Lord's merit and righteousness, being entirely Divine, could not in any way be, imported by imputation into any angel or man. In fact, if a mere drop of this, unless modified as stated, were to touch them, they would instantly be racked with the torments of the dying, their feet put out of joint and their eyes squinting, until they expired. This was well known in the Israelite church by the saying that no one can see God and live.</p>
<p>
[4] The sun of the spiritual world, as it is since Jehovah God took upon Himself human form and added to this redemption and a new righteousness, is described by these words of Isaiah:<p>The light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days, on the day when Jehovah binds up His people's broken limb, <a href="3927/isaiah_30_26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>.<p>This chapter from beginning to end deals with the Lord's coming. There is also a description of what would happen, if the Lord were to come down and come close to any ungodly person, in this passage of Revelation:<p>They hid themselves in caves and mountain rocks, and kept saying to the mountains and rocks, Hide us from the face of him that sits upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, <a href="3927/revelation_6_15.htm">Revelation 6:15-16</a>.<p>The expression 'the wrath of the Lamb' is used because at the approach of the Lord this is what that terror and torment seem to them to be like.</p>
<p>
[5] Another manifest proof of this can be drawn from the fact that, if any ungodly person were admitted to heaven, where charity and faith in the Lord reign, darkness would fall upon his eyes, dizziness and madness on his mind, pain and torment on his body, and he would become as if lifeless. What then would happen if the Lord Himself, with His Divine merit, which is redemption, and with His Divine righteousness were to enter into a person? Not even the Apostle John could withstand the Lord's presence, for we read that when he saw the Son of Man in the midst of the seven lampstands, he fell at His feet as if dead (<a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). </p>

<p>
641. Because, then, the Lord's merit and righteousness are purely Divine, and things purely Divine are such that if they were to be applied and ascribed to man he would instantly die and like a stick of wood thrown into the naked sun, would be so completely consumed that scarcely a particle of his ashes would be left; the Lord approaches angels and men with His Divine by means of light tempered and accommodated to the capacity and quality of each one, thus by means of what is brought down to man's level and adapted; and in the same way by means of heat.
</p>
<p>
[2] In the spiritual world there is a sun, in the midst of which is the Lord; from that sun the Lord flows in by means of light and heat into the whole spiritual world, and into all who are there. All the light and all the heat of that world are from this source. From that sun the Lord also flows with the same light and the same heat into the souls and minds of men. That heat in its essence is the Lord's Divine love, and that light in its essence is His Divine wisdom. The Lord adapts that light and that heat to the capacity and quality of the recipient angel and man, doing this by means of the spiritual auras or atmospheres that convey and transfer them. The Divine Itself which immediately encompasses the Lord, constitutes that sun. That sun is far off from the angels, as the sun of the natural world is from men, in order that it may not come into naked and thus untempered contact with them; since otherwise they would be consumed like a stick of wood thrown into the naked sun, as said above.
</p>
<p>
[3] All this makes clear that the Lord's merit and righteousness, being purely Divine, can in no possible way be transferred by imputation into any angel or man; and if even the least drop thereof, not so tempered as above stated, were to touch them, they would instantly writhe as if struggling with death, with feet contorted and eyes staring, and would become lifeless. In the Israelitish church this was known by their being taught that no man could see God and live.
</p>
<p>
[4] The sun of the spiritual world, such as it was after Jehovah God had assumed the Human, and had added thereto redemption and a new righteousness, is described in these words in Isaiah: <p>The light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day when Jehovah shall bind up the breach of His people (<a href="3927/isaiah_30_26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>). <p>This chapter from beginning to end treats of the Lord's coming. What would take place if the Lord were to come down and draw near to any wicked person, is also described in the following words in the Apocalypse: <p>They hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains, and said to the mountains and rocks, Hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the anger of the Lamb (<a href="3927/revelation_6_15.htm">Revelation 6:15, 16</a>). <p>It is said, "the anger of the Lamb" because their terror and torment when the Lord draws near appear to them like wrath.
</p>
<p>
[5] This may be still more evidently inferred from the fact, that if any impious person is admitted into heaven, where charity and faith in the Lord reign, darkness invades his eyes, giddiness and madness invade his mind, pain and torment his body, and he becomes like one dead. What then, if the Lord Himself, with His Divine merit, which is redemption, and His Divine righteousness, were to enter into man? The apostle John himself could not endure the presence of the Lord, for we read: <p>That when he saw the Son of man in the midst of the seven lampstands, he fell at His feet as one dead (<a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). </p>

641. The merit and righteousness of the Lord are purely Divine, and if things purely Divine were applied and ascribed to a man he would instantly die; and like a log cast into the sun's pure fire, he would be so consumed that scarcely his ashes would remain. Therefore, the Lord with His Divine approaches both angels and men by means of light tempered and moderated according to the capacity and nature of each, thus by means of that which is adequate and accommodated; and in like manner He approaches by means of heat.</p>
<p>
[2] In the spiritual world there is a Sun, in the midst of which is the Lord. From that Sun He flows in by means of light and heat into the whole spiritual world, and into all who dwell there; for all light and heat in that world are from this source. The Lord from that Sun flows in with the same light and heat into the souls and minds of men. This heat in its essence is His Divine Love, and this light in its essence is His Diving Wisdom; and the Lord adapts this light and heat to the capacity and nature of the recipient angel and man. This is effected by means of spiritual airs or atmospheres, which convey and transmit them. The Divine itself which immediately encompasses the Lord constitutes that Sun. It is distant from the angels as the sun of the natural world is from men; for otherwise they also would be consumed as was stated above, like a log cast into the sun's pure fire.</p>
<p>
[3] From this it may be evident that the merit and righteousness of the Lord, being purely Divine, cannot possibly be transferred by imputation to any angel or man; indeed, if a single particle of it, without being moderated as was said above, were to touch them, they would instantly suffer torture like those in the agonies of death; and with feet convulsed and eyes starting from their sockets they would breathe out their life. This was made known in the Israelitish Church by the declaration that no man can see God and live.</p>
<p>
[4] The Sun of the spiritual world, such as it is since Jehovah God assumed the Human and added to it redemption and a new righteousness, is described by these words in Isaiah:<p>"The light of the sun shall be seven-fold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of His people," <a href="3927/isaiah_30_26.htm">30:26</a>.<p>In this chapter, from the beginning to the end, the Coming of the Lord is treated of. What would happen if the Lord were to come down and approach a wicked person, is thus described in the Revelation:<p>"They hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; And said to the mountains and rocks... hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb" <a href="3927/revelation_6_15.htm">Revelation 6:15-16</a>.</p>
<p>
[5] It is called the wrath of the Lamb because the terror and torment so appear to them when the Lord approaches. This may also be evident from the fact that if a wicked person is admitted into heaven where charity and faith in the Lord prevail, thick darkness comes over his eyes, giddiness and madness assail his mind, his body is seized with pain and torment and he becomes like one dead. What then, would happen if the Lord Himself, with His Divine merit, which is redemption, and with His Divine righteousness were to enter a man? The Apostle John himself could not endure the presence of the Lord; for it is written:<p>That when he saw the Son of Man in the midst of the seven candlesticks, he fell at His feet as dead, <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>. </p>

641. Cum itaque Meritum et Justitia Domini sunt pure Divina, et pure Divina sunt talia, ut si applicarentur et addicarentur, homo in instanti emoreretur, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
et sicut stipes injectus nudo soli, consumeretur ita, ut vix remaneret favilla de illo; quare Dominus cum suo Divino accedit ad Angelos et ad homines per lucem temperatam et moderatam ad facultatem et qualitatem cujusvis, ita per adaequatum et accommodatum; similiter per calorem.</p>
<p>
[2] In Mundo spirituali est Sol, in cujus medio est Dominus; ex illo Sole influit Ille per lucem et calorem in totum Mundum spiritualem, et in omnes qui ibi sunt; omnis lux et omnis calor ibi inde est; Dominus ab illo Sole cum eadem luce et eodem calore influit etiam in animas et mentes hominum; calor ille in sua essentia est Divinus Ipsius Amor, et Lux illa in sua essentia est Divina Ipsius Sapientia; hanc lucem et illum calorem adaptat Dominus ad facultatem et qualitatem angeli et hominis recipientis, quod fit per auras seu athmosphaeras spirituales, quae vehunt et transferunt illa: ipsum Divinum immediate ambiens Dominum facit illum Solem. Hic Sol distat ab Angelis, sicut Sol Mundi naturalis ab hominibus, propter causam, ne nude et sic immediate tangeret illos, nam sic consumerentur, sicut stipes injectus nudo soli, ut dictum est.</p>
<p>
[3] Ex his constare potest, quod meritum et justitia Domini, quia sunt pure Divina, haudquaquam possint per imputationem in aliquem angelum aut hominem inferri, imo si aliqua stilla ejus non ita moderata, ut dictum est, tangeret illos, illico sicut laborantes cum morte torquerentur, luxando pedibus, divaricando oculos, et exanimarentur. Hoc in Ecclesia Israelitica notum factum est per hoc, quod nemo possit videre Deum et vivere.</p>
<p>
[4] Describitur etiam Sol Mundi spiritualis, qualis est postquam Jehovah Deus assumsit Humanum, et Huic adjecit Redemptionem et Justitiam novam, his verbis apud Esaiam, "Lux Solis erit septupla, sicut Lux septem dierum, in die quo Jehovah obligabit fracturam populi," <a href="3927/isaiah_30_26.htm">30:26</a> in quo Capite a principio ad finem agitur de adventu Domini. Describitur etiam quid fieret, si Dominus descenderet, et appropinquaret ad aliquem impium, per haec in Apocalypsi, "Absconderunt se in speluncis et petris montium, et dicebant montibus et petris, abscondite nos a facie Sedentis super Throno, et ab ira Agni," <a href="3927/revelation_6_15.htm">Apocalypsi 6:15-16</a>; ira Agni dicitur, quia illis ita apparet terror et cruciatus appropinquante Domino.</p>
<p>
[5] Hoc adhuc evidenter concludi potest ex hoc, quod si aliquis impius intromittitur in Coelum, ubi charitas et fides in Dominum regnant, invadat oculos ejus caligo, mentem ejus vertigo et insania, corpus ejus dolor et cruciatus, et fiat sicut exanimis; quid tunc si Ipse Dominus cum Divino suo merito, quod est Redemptio, et cum Divina sua Justitia, hominem intraret. Ipse Johannes Apostolus nec sustinuit praesentiam Domini, nam legitur, quod cum vidit Filium Hominis in medio septem Candelabrorum, ceciderit ad pedes Ipsius sicut mortuus, <a href="3927/revelation_1_13.htm">Apocalypsis 1:13</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">17</a>. <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
