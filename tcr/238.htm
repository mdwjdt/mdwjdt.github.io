<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>238</b>.字义上的圣言就像一个百宝箱，里面依次摆列着宝石、珍珠和钻石。如果人视圣言为神圣，为有用的生活而阅读圣言，那么其心智的思维就好比手持这类百宝箱并将其抛向天堂的人；宝箱边上升边打开，里面的宝物便呈现给众天使，众天使则极其欢喜地查看它们。天使的这种快乐被分享给此人，产生联结和感知的共享。圣餐的设立就是为了与天使的这种联结，并同时与主的结合。其中，饼在天上变成神圣良善，酒在天上变成神圣真理，它们都出自主。这种对应因创造而存在，并被建立，以便天使天堂能与地上的教会合为一体，灵界总体上能与尘世合为一体，以及主能同时将自己与这二者结合起来。</p>

238. 文字意義中的聖言如同一個寶盒中一排排擺放著寶石,珍珠和鑽石。如果一個人尊聖言為聖, 視聖言為生活指引來拜讀, 這人的思想便如同某人手中持有這樣的寶盒, 將它拋向空中; 寶盒邊上升邊打開, 裡面的寶物向天人們展現出來, 天人們極其歡喜地查看並細心數點著寶物。他們與人一同分享由此而得的歡樂, 並與人產生聯合,理念共用。為了與天人們的如此聯合, 並同時與主連接, 聖餐為此而設立; 聖餐中的餅在天國中成為聖善, 葡萄酒成為聖理, 這些都由主而來。這類的對應自創世起就存在, 如此設立乃是為了天國中的天人能與地上的教會結合為一, 心靈世界與物質世界在總體上能合為一, 以致于主將祂自己與二者一起相連接。 </p>

238. In its letter the Word is like a case that has precious stones, pearls, and gems laid out in a pattern inside. When we regard the Word as holy and read it in order to have a useful life, our minds have thoughts like a jewel case that someone takes hold of and sends up to heaven. As the jewel case rises, it opens, making the precious things inside accessible to the angels, who are profoundly delighted to see them and to hold them up to the light. The angels' pleasure is shared with us; this process brings angels into association with us and allows them to share with us not only that pleasure but also their perceptions.
<p>The Holy Supper was established to allow us this kind of association with angels as well as a connection to the Lord. During the Holy Supper, in heaven the bread becomes divine goodness and the wine becomes divine truth, both of which are from the Lord. Ever since creation this correspondence has existed for two reasons: so the angelic heaven and the church on earth, or more generally the spiritual world and the physical world, could be one; and so the Lord could be connected to both of them at once. </p>

238. The Word in its literal sense is like a treasure-chest, in which lie arranged in rows precious stones, pearls and diadems. If a person regards the Word as holy and reads it as a useful guide to life, the thoughts in his mind can be compared to one who holds such a chest in his hand, and throws it heavenwards; and as it rises it flies open and the treasures inside reach the angels, who take great pleasure in seeing and carefully examining them. The pleasure they get from this is shared with men and brings about association and also the sharing of perceptions. It was for the sake of this association with angels, and at the same time being linked with the Lord, that the Holy Supper was instituted; in this the bread becomes in heaven Divine good and the wine becomes Divine truth, in both cases coming from the Lord. This kind of correspondence is from creation, and was established in order that the heaven of the angels and the church on earth, and in general the spiritual world and the natural one, should be one, and so that the Lord might link Himself with both at once. </p>

238. The Word in the letter is like a casket, where precious stones, pearls, and diadems lie in order. The thoughts of a man's mind, who regards the Word as holy, and who reads it for the sake of the uses of life, may be compared to one holding such a casket in his hand, and throwing it toward heaven; and the casket opening in its ascent, the precious things in it are disclosed to the angels, who are deeply delighted in seeing and examining them. This delight of the angels is communicated to the man, and effects an affiliation and a sharing of perceptions. For the sake of this affiliation with angels, and at the same time conjunction with the Lord, the Holy Supper was instituted, the bread of which in heaven becomes Divine good, and the wine Divine truth, each from the Lord. Such correspondence exists by creation, to the end that the angelic heaven may make one with the church on earth, and in general the spiritual world may make one with the natural world, and the Lord may conjoin Himself with both at once. </p>

238. Verbum in litera est sicut Theca, in qua in ordine jacent lapides pretiosi, uniones, et diademata; homo, qui sanctum habet Verbum, et propter usus vitae legit illud, <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
ejus mentis cogitationes sunt comparative, sicut qui thecam talem in manu tenet, et mittit illam ad Coelum, et haec in ascensu aperitur, et pretiosa inibi ad Angelos veniunt, qui ex illis visis et lustratis penitus delectantur; haec illorum <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
delectatio communicatur cum homine, et facit consociationem, et quoque communicationem perceptionum. Propter hanc consociationem cum Angelis, et simul conjunctionem cum Domino, instituta est SANCTA COENA, in qua PANIS fit in Coelo Divinum Bonum et VINUM fit Divinum Verum, utrumque a Domino: talis Correspondentia est ex Creatione, propter finem, ut Coelum Angelicum et Ecclesia in terris, et in genere Mundus spiritualis cum Mundo naturali, unum faciat, et Dominus se cum utroque simul conjungat.<p>
