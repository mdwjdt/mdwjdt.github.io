<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>710</b>.这也可通过对比来说明。一个出于爱国而与敌人战斗到死，从而使国家摆脱奴役枷锁的人，谁不怀念和热爱呢？当看到自己的同胞陷入绝境，由于饥荒面临死亡时，一个出于怜悯散尽家财的人，谁不怀念和热爱呢？一个出于爱和友情，杀掉他仅有的一只羔羊以招待客人的人，谁不怀念和热爱呢？凡此种种，不一而足。</p>

710. 这也可通过对比来说明。 一个出于爱国而与敌人战斗到死, 从而使国家摆脱奴役枷锁的人, 谁不怀念和热爱呢? 当看到自己的同胞陷入绝境, 由于饥荒面临死亡时, 一个出于怜悯散尽家财的人, 谁不怀念和热爱呢? 一个出于爱和友情, 杀掉他仅有的一只羔羊以招待客人的人, 谁不怀念和热爱呢? 凡此种种, 不一而足。 </p>

710. This last point can also be illustrated with comparisons. Surely we all love and remember people who were moved by a passionate love of country to fight against its enemies even to their death in order to free it from the yoke of slavery. Surely we all love and remember people who saw their fellow citizens in extreme poverty, starving to death before their eyes, and were moved by compassion and took all the silver and gold out of their houses and distributed it expecting nothing in return. Surely we all love and remember people who were moved by love and friendship and took their last lamb and butchered it and prepared it as a feast for their guests. And so on. </p>

<p>
710. This too can be illustrated by comparisons. Does anyone fail to remember and love someone, who out of zealous love for his country fights an enemy to the death, so as to free his country from the yoke of slavery? And does anyone fail to remember and love someone, who on seeing his fellow citizens in the direst straits, with the sight of them dying of starvation before his eyes, then is moved by pity to bring all his silver and gold out of his house and give it away freely? And does anyone fail to remember and love someone, who out of love and friendship takes the one last lamb he has, and slaughters it to serve up to his guests? And so on. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #710 (Ager, 1970)
</h4>
<p>
710. This too may be illustrated by comparisons. Who does not remember and love the man who, from the zeal of love for his country, fights with her enemies even unto death, that he may thereby deliver her from the yoke of servitude? And who does not remember and love the man who, when he sees his fellow-citizens in extreme want, with death from grievous famine staring them in the face, out of pity brings forth all his gold and silver from his house and distributes it freely? And who does not remember and love the man who, out of love and friendship, takes the only lamb he possesses, kills it, and sets it before his guests? And so on. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #710 (Dick, 1950)
</h4>
<p>
710. This also may be illustrated by comparisons. Who does not remember and love the man who, from zealous love for his country, fights against her enemies even unto death, that he may thereby free her from the yoke of slavery? Who does not remember and love the man who, seeing his fellow citizens in extreme want and dying before his eyes in the relentless grip of famine, brings forth from his house all his silver and gold and freely distributes it? Who, again, does not remember and love the man who, out of pure love and friendship, takes the only lamb he possesses, kills it, and sets it before his guests? And so on. </p>

710. Hoc quoque illustrari potest per Comparationes: Quis non recordatur ejus et amat illum, qui ex zelo amoris pro Patria pugnat cum hoste usque ad mortem, ut per id liberet <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
illam a jugo servitutis. Et quis non recordatur ejus et amat illum, qui dum videt concives in extrema egestate, ac mortem illorum ex ingravescente fame ante oculos, et tunc ex miseratione omne suum Argentum et Aurum e domo sua educit, et gratis distribuit: et quis non recordatur ejus et amat illum, qui ex amore et amicitia sumit unicum agnum quem possidet, et hunc mactat et apponit convivis: et sic porro.<p>
