<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>724</b>.上述说法，和前面的一样，也可通过符合并对应的例子来说明，比如：除了职位级别高的官员外，没人被准许进到皇帝或国王的御座前，甚至在朝见之前，这些高官要穿着得体，戴好饰品，以便当他们出现时，能被接受和认可。人在靠近主的宝座前，不也得这样吗？因为祂是万主之主，万王之王（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.14.htm">启示录17:14</a>），所有人被邀请和呼召到祂的宝座前。但只有那些灵性相配，穿着得体的人，在从宝座前起身后，才被准许进入天堂的宫殿和喜悦中，被尊为王子，因为他们是大君王的众子，然后日日与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各一同坐席（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太8.11.htm">马太福音8:11</a>），这些名字指的是属天神性、属灵神性和属世神性方面的主。上述说法还好比地上的婚礼，只邀请新郎与新娘的至亲好友参加；若有别的人来，也被允许进入，但由于筵席上没有他的位子，所以就离开了。被呼召参加为新郎的主和为新娘的教会的婚礼之人也是如此。在这些人中，属于被主重生家族的人就是至亲好友。同样，除非世人拿出真诚的心，遵从别人的心意，否则，谁能开启一段友情？只有这样的人才算他的朋友，人才能放心将财产托付他。</p>

724. 上述说法, 和前面的一样, 也可通过符合并对应的例子来说明, 比如: 除了职位级别高的官员外, 没人被准许进到皇帝或国王的御座前, 甚至在朝见之前, 这些高官要穿着得体, 戴好饰品, 以便当他们出现时, 能被接受和认可。 人在靠近主的宝座前, 不也得这样吗? 因为祂是万主之主, 万王之王 (<a href="3927/revelation_17_14.htm">启示录17:14</a>), 所有人被邀请和呼召到祂的宝座前。 但只有那些灵性相配, 穿着得体的人, 在从宝座前起身后, 才被准许进入天堂的宫殿和喜悦中, 被尊为王子, 因为他们是大君王的众子, 然后日日与亚伯拉罕, 以撒, 雅各一同坐席 (<a href="3927/matthew_8_11.htm">马太福音8:11</a>), 这些名字指的是属天神性, 属灵神性和属世神性方面的主。 上述说法还好比地上的婚礼, 只邀请新郎与新娘的至亲好友参加; 若有别的人来, 也被允许进入, 但由于筵席上没有他的位子, 所以就离开了。 被呼召参加为新郎的主和为新娘的教会的婚礼之人也是如此。 在这些人中, 属于被主重生家族的人就是至亲好友。 同样, 除非世人拿出真诚的心, 遵从别人的心意, 否则, 谁能开启一段友情? 只有这样的人才算他的朋友, 人才能放心将财产托付他。 </p>

724. As with earlier points, these points too can be illustrated by various things that align well and also things that correspond. For example: The only people who are allowed to share a meal at the table of an emperor or monarch are people of the highest office and rank. Before such people come to such a dinner, they put on their best clothes and their badges of office in order to be allowed in and be well received. Why should we not have to prepare for the table of the Lord, who is the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings (<a href="3927/revelation_17_14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>)? All have been called and invited to his table, but after they rise from it, only those who are spiritually worthy and suitably dressed are brought into the palaces of heaven to experience the joys that are there; only people like these are honored as members of the royal family because they are children of the Highest King. Afterward they sit down every day with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="3927/matthew_8_11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>), meaning the Lord's divine heavenly quality, his divine spiritual quality, and his divine earthly quality.
<p>The points made above can also be compared to wedding celebrations on earth, to which only relatives, neighbors, and friends of the bride and groom are invited. If others come, they are of course allowed in, but because there is no seat for them at the table, they leave. The situation is similar with those who are invited to the wedding celebrations of the Lord as the bridegroom and the church as the bride; the people who are invited are the neighbors, relatives, and friends who have acquired a new family tree through being regenerated by the Lord.
<p>For another thing, in our world who else do we develop a deep friendship with except people who are good-hearted and who trust us and do things in accordance with our wishes? We count them and no others as our own people and trust them with everything we own. </p>

724. As in previous cases these facts can be illustrated by examples which agree and also correspond, as for instance the following. None are admitted to the table of an emperor or king but those who hold high office and rank; and these, before coming, dress themselves in proper clothes and wear their decorations, so that when they appear they will be received and approved. Should one then not do the same on approaching the Lord's table, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings (<a href="3927/revelation_17_14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>), and all are invited and called to His table? But only those who are spiritually worthy and in dignified dress are, after rising from the table, admitted to the palaces of heaven and the joys of heaven, being honoured like princes, because they are sons of the greatest King, and afterwards sit at table daily with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (<a href="3927/matthew_8_11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>). By these names are meant the Lord as regards the celestial Divine, the spiritual Divine, and the natural Divine.<p>The same facts can also be compared with a wedding on earth, to which only close relatives, kinsfolk and friends of the bridegroom and bride are invited. If anyone else comes, he is allowed in, but leaves because there is no place for him at the table. It is much the same with those who are summoned to the wedding of the Lord as bridegroom with the church as bride. Among these are the kinsfolk, relatives and friends who belong to the family by being regenerated by the Lord. Moreover, is anyone in the world allowed to become someone's friend, unless in sincerity of heart he trusts him and does his will? It is this person and no others that one counts among one's friends and to whom one entrusts one's property. </p>

724. These statements, like the former, may be illustrated by various things that are in accord with them, and also by some that correspond, as the following: No one is admitted to the table of an emperor or king except those who are high in office and rank; and even these, before they attend, clothe themselves in becoming garments, and put on their insignia, that they may come acceptably and receive favor. Why not the same with the table of the Lord, who is the Lord of lords and King of kings (<a href="3927/revelation_17_14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>) to which table all are called and invited? But only those who are spiritually worthy and are clothed in honorable apparel are admitted, after arising from the table, into the palaces of heaven, and into the joys there, and honored as princes because they are sons of the Great King, and afterward sit down daily with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="3927/matthew_8_11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>), by whom is meant the Lord in respect to the Divine celestial, the Divine spiritual, and the Divine natural. These things may also be likened to weddings on earth, to which only the relatives, connections, and friends of the bridegroom and bride are invited; and if anyone else comes, he may be admitted, but as he has no place at the table, he withdraws. So is it with those who are called to the marriage of the Lord as the Bridegroom with the church as the bride, with whom those are kindred, relatives, and friends, whose common origin comes through regeneration by the Lord. And again, who in the world is initiated into another's friendship, unless he is at heart sincerely faithful and does what the other wishes? Such only does a man number among his friends and trust with his property. </p>

724. Like the previous subjects, this may be illustrated by various comparisons and correspondences, such as the following. None are admitted to the table of an emperor or a king, but those of high station and rank; and even these, before their admission, clothe themselves in becoming garments, and wear their proper decorations, so as to meet with a gracious and favorable reception. Why, then, should men not so approach the table of the Lord, who is the Lord of lords and King of kings, <a href="3927/revelation_17_14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>, to which all are called and invited? Only those, however, who are spiritually worthy and are clothed in honorable apparel, after they rise from the table, are admitted into the palaces of heaven, and to the joys there. They are honored as princes because they are sons of the Great King; and they afterwards sit down daily with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, <a href="3927/matthew_8_11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>, who signify the Lord as to the Divine Celestial, the Divine Spiritual and the Divine Natural. It may also be compared to a marriage on earth, to which are invited only the relatives, connections and friends of the bridegroom and bride. If any other person enters, he is admitted indeed; but having no place assigned to him at the table, he retires. So it is with those who are called to the marriage of the Lord as the Bridegroom, with the Church as the Bride. Among them those are relations, connections and friends who derive their lineage from the Lord by regeneration. Moreover, no one in the world is admitted into another's friendship unless he sincerely trusts him and willingly serves him. Such a one and no others does he reckon among his own, and entrusts with his goods. </p>

Quod ad Mensam Imperatoris et Regis non admittantur alii, quam qui in honorifica functione et dignitate sunt, et quod hi quoque, antequam accedunt, amiciant se decoris vestibus, et exornent insignibus, ut accepti accedant et faveantur; quid non ad Mensam Domini, qui est Dominus dominorum, et Rex regum, <a href="3927/revelation_17_14.htm">Apocalypsis 17:14</a>, ad quam omnes vocati et invitati sunt; at solum illi qui spiritualiter digni sunt, et in honorifico vestitu, postquam resurgunt e mensa, intromittuntur in palatia <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
