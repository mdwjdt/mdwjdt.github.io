</h4>
<p>
487. It used to seem incredible to me that any Christian could ever come to such a deranged conclusion, let alone spread it around by word of mouth or bring it to light by publication; and I refused to believe it even though such a conclusion was in fact drawn by a select group of clergy at the Synod of Dort in Holland, and was afterward written out in a careful hand and distributed to the public. To convince me, some of those who participated in the decisions of that Synod were brought to me.
<p>When I noticed them standing near me I said, "How could someone whose reason is at all sound conclude that there is predestination? What else could this have led to except a flood of ideas that God is cruel and that religion is fraudulent? If people support predestination and engrave it on their hearts, how can they avoid seeing the teachings of the church and the Word as pointless? Can they think of God as anything but a tyrant, since he predestines hundreds of thousands to hell?"
</p>
<p>
[2] They stared at me with a satanic look and said, "We were selected to participate in the Synod of Dort. At the time, and even more so since then, we convinced ourselves of many things concerning God, the Word, and religion that we didn't dare divulge. Instead, when we spoke about and taught those topics, we spun and wove a web of multicolored threads, and on it we spread peacock feathers. "
<p>Because the speakers were trying to do the same thing now, angels who were given power by the Lord closed the outer levels of their minds and opened the inner levels in them, and made them speak from those levels instead.
<p>They then said, "We based the faith that we had then and that we still have now on a series of conclusions. We believe the following:
</p>
<p>
[3] (1) There is no such thing as the Word of Jehovah God; there is only some empty verbosity from the mouth of the prophets. (We came to this thought because the Word predestines all to heaven, and people themselves are to blame if they don't walk on the paths that lead there.) (2) Religion does and should exist, but it is no more than a strong wind that bears a [calming,] fragrant odor to the masses. Therefore religion should be taught by ministers to the small as well as the great, and should be based on the Word, because the Word's teaching is well received. (We had these thoughts because predestination actually renders religion null and void.) (3) The civil laws of justice are religion; but we are predestined not because of the lives we lived by those laws but exclusively because that is up to God, like the decision of an absolute monarch based on one look at our face. (4) With the exception of the one point that God exists, everything the church teaches ought to be regarded as nonsense that we should disapprove of and garbage that we should throw out. (5) The supposedly spiritual teachings that are paraded before us are actually nothing more than vapors of subsolar ether: if they penetrate us deeply they cause dizziness and lethargy and turn us into a detestable monster in the sight of God. "
<p>(6) They were asked whether they believed that the faith on which they based the idea of predestination was spiritual or not. They answered that people are predestined based on their faith, but when faith is granted them, they are like logs. From that state they are indeed brought to life, but not spiritually.
</p>
<p>
[4] After uttering these horrible things, they wanted to leave, but I said to them, "Stay here a little longer, and I will read to you from Isaiah. "
<p>What I read them was this:
<p>Do not be happy, all Philistia, that the rod that was striking you is broken, because from the root of the serpent a basilisk has come out, and its fruit is a flying fire snake. (<a href="3927/isaiah_14_29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>)
<p>I used the spiritual meaning of the passage to explain it: Philistia means the church that is separated from goodwill. The basilisk that has come out from the root of the serpent means the teaching of that church that there are three gods and that Christ's righteousness is assigned to every individual. Its fruit, which is a flying fire snake, means the idea that there is no credit for good actions or blame for evil actions; there is instant mercy, regardless of whether our lives have been good or evil.
</p>
<p>
[5] "Perhaps that is the meaning," they said. "But find us a passage on predestination in that volume that you call the Holy Word. "
<p>I opened it up and in the same prophet I came upon this passage, which agrees with what I had quoted them earlier:
<p>They were laying the eggs of a poisonous snake and weaving the webs of a spider. Whoever eats their eggs dies, and when someone crushes [one of those eggs], a viper is hatched. (<a href="3927/isaiah_59_5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>)
<p>When they heard that, they did not wait around for the explanation. Five of the people who had been brought to me hurled themselves violently into a cave. Around it there appeared a dark glow - a sign that they had no faith or goodwill.
<p>From all this it follows that the Synod's decree about predestination is not just an insane heresy but a cruel heresy as well. It has to be eradicated from the brain so thoroughly that not even a single jot of it remains. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #487 (Chadwick, 1988)

<p>
487. I thought that such a crazy notion could never be decided upon by a Christian, much less expressed in speech and given public utterance, though in fact it was done by so many representatives of the clergy at the Synod of Dort in Holland, where it was cleverly written up and published. So to set aside my doubts some of those who had taken part in the decisions of that Synod were sent for to come to me.<p>When I saw them standing nearby I said: 'How can anyone who relies upon sound reason come to the conclusion that we are predestined? Surely only cruel ideas about God can flow from this, and criminal ideas about religion? Surely anyone whose support for predestination has engraved it on his heart can only think about everything belonging to the church, and likewise about the Word, as being worthless? Can he think of a God who has predestined so many thousands of people for hell as anything but a tyrant?'</p>
<p>
[2] When I said this, they gave me a satanic look and said: 'We were among the chosen representatives at the Synod of Dort. Then, and still more since, we have convinced ourselves of much about God, the Word and religion, which we have not dared to make public. But when we talked and taught about religion, we wove and knitted a web of threads of various colours, and scattered over it feathers borrowed from peacocks' wings.' But since they wanted to do the same on this occasion, angels using the power given them by the Lord shut the externals of their minds and opened the interiors for them, forcing them to speak as these dictated. Then they said: 'Our faith which we formed by a series of arguments one depending on the next was and is still as follows.</p>
<p>
[3] (1) There is no such thing as the Word of Jehovah God, but some airy utterance from the mouth of the prophets. We thought so because the Word predestines all for heaven and holds man to blame only if he does not walk in the ways which lead there.<p>(2) Religion exists because it is needed; but it is like a gust of wind which carries a fragrant smell to charm the masses. Religion therefore must be taught by ministers, small and great, as being drawn from the Word, because this is accepted. We had this idea because where there is predestination, there religion is nothing.<p>(3) The laws of civil justice constitute a religion; but predestination is not dependent upon living by them, but on nothing but God's good pleasure, just as in the case of a monarch with absolute power, it depends solely on the look on his face.<p>(4) Everything the church teaches, except the existence of God, is to be dismissed as empty verbiage and rejected as rubbish.<p>(5) The spiritual matters so much talked about are no more than ethereal vapours beneath the sun, and if they penetrate deeply into anyone, they make him become giddy and stupefied, turning him into a detestable monster in the sight of God.'<p>(6) When they were asked whether they believed the faith from which they deduced predestination was spiritual, they said that faith depended upon predestination, but when it was given they were like blocks of Wood; as a result they were indeed brought to life, but not spiritually.</p>
<p>
[4] After delivering these dreadful statements they wanted to go away, but I said to them: 'Stay a little while and I will read to you from Isaiah.' What I read was this:<p>Do not rejoice, all of Philistia, that the rod that smites you is broken, for a basilisk has come forth from the root of the snake, whose fruit is a flying serpent, <a href="3927/isaiah_14_29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>.<p>I explained this by means of the spiritual sense. Philistia means the church separated from charity. The basilisk which came forth from the root of the snake means its teaching about three Gods, and about its belief in imputation being granted to each person individually. Its fruit which is a flying serpent means there is no imputation of good and evil, but instant mercy, whether a person has lived a good or a wicked life.</p>
<p>
[5] On hearing this they said: 'This may be; but find us something from that book you call the holy Word about predestination.' I opened the book and came across in the same prophet this passage which fitted:<p>They laid asp's eggs and wove spider's webs. Anyone who eats one of their eggs dies; and when anyone crushes one, a viper is hatched, <a href="3927/isaiah_59_5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>.<p>On hearing this they could not bear to listen to the explanation, but some of them who had been sent for (there were five of them) cast themselves into a cave, around which appeared a dark fiery glow, a sign that they were without either faith or charity.<p>This makes it plain that the decree of the Synod about predestination is not only a crazy heresy, but also a cruel heresy. It must therefore be eradicated from the brain, so that not so much as one jot of it is left. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #487 (Ager, 1970)
</h4>
<p>
487. I had thought that such senseless doctrine never could have been sanctioned by any Christian, much less have found utterance and a public promulgation; and yet this was done by many chosen men of the clergy at the Synod of Dort, in Holland, and the creed was afterward elegantly written and given to the public; and because of this and to remove my doubts, some of those who aided in framing the decrees of that synod were sent to me. <p>When they appeared standing near me, I said, "Who from any sound reason can reach the conclusion that predestination is true doctrine? Can it be that any but cruel ideas of God and shameful ideas of religion should flow from it? When anyone has engraved predestination on his heart by means of confirmations must he not think of all that pertains to the church as destitute of meaning, and the same of the Word? And must he not think of God, who has predestined to hell so many myriads of men, as a tyrant?"
</p>
<p>
[2] At these remarks they looked at me with a satanic expression, and said, "We were among those chosen to form the Synod of Dort, and we then confirmed ourselves and have since continued to do so still more in many ideas respecting God, the Word, and religion, which we have not dared to make public; but when we have spoken on these subjects and taught them, we have twisted and woven a web of various colored threads, and over it strewed feathers borrowed from the wings of peacocks." But because they still wished to do the same, the angels, by power given them by the Lord, closed the externals of their minds and opened the internals, and from these they were compelled to speak. And then they said, "Our faith, which we have formed by conclusions, one following from another, was and still is as follows:
</p>
<p>
[3] (1) "That there is no Word of Jehovah God, but some windy afflatus from the mouths of the prophets. This we have thought, because the Word predestines all to heaven, and teaches that man alone is in fault if he does not walk in the ways that lead thither. (2) That religion exists because it is necessary; but it is like a strong wind bearing a fragrant odor for the vulgar; therefore that it ought to be taught by ministers, both small and great, and from the Word too, because the Word is accepted. This we have thought, because where there is predestination there religion is a nullity. (3) That the civil laws of justice are religion; but predestination is not determined by a life in accord with those laws, but by the pure good pleasure of God, as with a king in whose mere glance there is absolute power. (4) The all that the church teaches ought to be exploded as vanity, and rejected as rubbish, except that there is a God. (5) That spiritual things, which are so cried up, are nothing but ethereal substances beneath the sun, which induce upon man, if they penetrate deeply into him, vertigo and stupor, and make him a detestable monster in the sight of God." (6) When they were asked about faith (from which they deduced predestination), whether they believed it to be spiritual, they said that it was effected according to predestination, but when it is given men were like stocks. From this they are indeed vivified, but not spiritually.
</p>
<p>
[4] After these horrible sayings they wished to go away; but I said to them, "Wait a little longer, and I will read you something from Isaiah;" and I read the following: <p>Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of thee, because the rod that smiteth thee is broken; for out of the serpent's root hath gone forth a cockatrice, whose fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent (<a href="3927/isaiah_14_29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>). <p>And this I explained by the spiritual sense, showing that "Philistia" means the church separate from charity; that the "cockatrice" that had gone forth from the serpent's root means its doctrine of three Gods and of imputative faith applied to each singly; and that its "fruit," which is a fiery flying serpent, means no imputation of good and evil, but immediate mercy, whether man lives well or ill.
</p>
<p>
[5] Hearing this, they said, "It may be so; but from that volume which you call the Holy Word select something on predestination." And I opened the book, and in the same Prophet I came upon the following passage, which suited the purpose: <p>They hatched viper's eggs and wove the spider's web; he that eateth of their eggs dieth: and when one is crushed it breaketh out into a viper (<a href="3927/isaiah_59_5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>). <p>Hearing this, they could not endure the explanation; but some of those who had been sent to me (there were five) hurried away into a cave, round about which appeared a dusky burning, a sign that they had neither faith nor charity. Evidently, therefore, the decree of that synod respecting predestination is not only an insane but a cruel heresy; and ought, therefore, to be so rooted out from the brain that not a single vestige of it shall be left. </p>


<h4 align="center">True Christian Religion #487 (Dick, 1950)
</h4>
<p>
487. I hardly thought that such an extravagant doctrine could ever have been decreed by any Christian, much less declared and published to the world: this, nevertheless, was done by many delegates of the clergy at the Synod of Dort <sup "fn9_1">1</sup>
in Holland; and it was afterwards carefully drawn up and widely circulated. In order, therefore, that I might have no doubts upon the matter, some of those who had supported the decrees of that Synod were summoned to meet me.<p>When I saw them standing near me I said: "Is it possible for any one of sound reason to reach a conclusion in favor of predestination? Must not that doctrine give rise to cruel ideas concerning God and to the most shocking opinions concerning religion? Must not a man, who has engraved the belief in predestination on his heart by confirmations in its favor, regard all things of the Church and the Word itself as vain? Must he not think of God as a tyrant because He has predestined so many myriads of men to hell?"</p>
<p>
[2] At these words they gave me a satanic look and said: "We were delegates at the Synod of Dort, during which, and still more so afterwards, we confirmed our belief in many matters concerning God, the Word and religion which we have not ventured to make public; but in our conversation and teaching on the decisions of the Synod we wove and twisted a web of threads of various colors, which we covered over with feathers borrowed from the wings of peacocks." As they were now preparing to do the same again, the angels, by a power given them by the Lord, closed up the externals of their mind and opened their internals, from which they now had to speak.<p>Then they continued: "Our faith, which we have formed from conclusions supporting one another in logical sequence, was and still is the following:</p>
<p>
[3] 1. There is no such thing as the Word of Jehovah God, but only some windy declaration from the mouth of the prophets. This is our opinion, because the Word predestines all to heaven, and teaches that man alone is at fault if he does not walk in the ways that lead thither. 2. There is such a thing as religion, because it is expedient that there should be; but it is only like a gale bringing a fragrant odor for the common people. It ought, therefore, to be taught by ministers of humble as well as of exalted rank and enforced from the Word, because the Word is commonly accepted. This is our opinion, because where predestination prevails, religion is of no account. 3. The laws of civil justice constitute religion; but predestination does not depend on a life in accordance with those laws, but merely upon the good pleasure of God, as a sovereign of absolute power acting merely from caprice. 4. All the doctrines taught by the Church ought to be exploded as empty vaporings and rejected as worthless, except this, that there is a God. 5. Spiritual things, which are made so much of, are ethereal matters just bordering upon the sun; and if they deeply penetrate into a man, they affect him with a dizzy stupor, and make him a detestable monster in God's sight." 6. I then asked them whether they believed that the faith from which they deduced the doctrine of predestination was spiritual. They replied: "Predestination takes place according to that faith; but when faith is given, the man is like a stock, and though he is afterwards quickened, the life he thus receives is not spiritual."</p>
<p>
[4] After having uttered these horrid opinions they desired to depart, but I said to them: "Stay a little longer, and I will read to you from Isaiah." I accordingly read as follows:<p>"Rejoice not thou, whole Philistia (A.V., Palestina), because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root has come (A.V., shall come) forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent. <a href="3927/isaiah_14_29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>.<p>I explained this passage according to its spiritual sense, showing that Philistia means the Church separate from charity; the cockatrice which came forth out of the serpent's root means the Church's doctrine concerning three Gods and a faith that imputes, applied to every one individually; and his fruit, which is a fiery flying serpent, means that there is no imputation of good and evil, but only immediate mercy, whether a man has lived well or ill.</p>
<p>
[5] On hearing this explanation they said: "This may be so; but from that Book which you call the Holy Word, read us something about predestination." I opened it and found in the same prophet this appropriate passage:<p>"They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper" <a href="3927/isaiah_59_5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>.<p>When they heard these words they could not endure to have them explained; but some of those who had been summoned-there were five of them-rushed into a cave, which appeared lit up all round with a dusky glow, a sign that they had neither faith nor charity.<p>It is, therefore, evident that this synodical decree concerning predestination is not only an insane but also a cruel heresy. It should be rooted out from the mind so that not even a trace of it remains.<p>

487. Quoniam cogitavi quod tale cerebrosum nusquam potuerit ab aliquo Christiano decerni, minus ore effundi, et in publicam lucem evulgari, quod tamen factum est a tot electis ex Clero in Synodo Dordrecti in Hollandia, et postea nitide scriptum, et in publicum emissum; ideo ne dubitarem, aliqui ex illis, qui a decretis illius Synodi fuerunt, ad me arcessiti sunt. Quando visi sunt prope me stare, dixi, quis ex aliqua ratione sana potest concludere Praedestinationem; num potest aliter quam quod crudeles ideae de Deo inde profluant, ac flagitiosae de Religione; num qui Praedestinationem per confirmationes cordi suo insculpsit, potest quicquam cogitare de omnibus quae Ecclesiae sunt, nisi quod sint vana, similiter de Verbo; et de Deo, quia tot myriades hominum praedestinavit ad Infernum, quam sicut de Tyranno;</p>
<p>
[2] his dictis satanico vultu me inspexerunt, dicentes, nos fuimus ex electis in Synodo Dodrechtana, ac tunc et adhuc plus postea confirmavimus nos in multis de Deo, de Verbo, et de Religione, quae non vulgare ausi sumus, sed cum loquuti sumus et docuimus de illa, contexuimus et contorsimus telam ex filis variorum colorum, et super illam stravimus plumas ex alis pavonum mutuatas; sed quia similiter nunc facere volebant, Angeli ex potentia sibi a Domino data, occluserunt mentis illorum Externa, et aperuerunt ejus Interna apud illos, et ex his adacti sunt loqui: et tunc dixerunt; nostra fides, quam formavimus per conclusiones, unam sequentem ex altera, fuerat et adhuc est haec. <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>

[3] Quod non sit aliquod Verbum Jehovae Dei, sed ventosum quid efflatum ex ore prophetarum: hoc cogitavimus, quia Verbum praedestinat omnes ad Coelum, et quod modo homo sit in culpa si non ambulat vias quae illuc tendunt. 2. Quod Religio sit, quia oportet esse, sed quod sit sicut procella ferens odorem fragrantem pro Vulgo; quod illa ideo a Ministris tam parvis quam magnis docenda sit, et quod ex Verbo, quia hoc receptum est; hoc cogitavimus, quia ubi praedestinatio, ibi Religio nihil est. 3. Quod Leges justitiae civiles sint Religio; at quod Praedestinatio non sit secundum vitam ex illis, sed ex puro beneplacito Dei, sicut apud absolutae potestatis Regem ex sola visa facie. 4. Quod ut vanitates explodenda, ac ut quisquiliae rejicienda sint omnia quae Ecclesia docet, praeter QUOD DEUS SIT. 5. Quod spiritualia, quae venditantur, non sint plus quam aetherea sub Sole, quae si alte penetrant in hominem, inducant ei vertiginem et stuporem, et faciant illum detestabile monstrum coram Deo. 6. Interrogati de Fide, ex qua Praedestinationem deduxerunt, Numeri crediderint illam spiritualem esse, dixerunt, quod secundum illam fiat, sed quod cum datur, sint sicut trunci, ex quibus quidem vivificantur, sed non spiritualiter.</p>

[4] Post haec dira effata voluerunt recedere, sed dixi illis, manete aliquantum adhuc, et legam coram vobis ex Esaja, et legi haec, Ne laeteris Philisthaea tota, quod fracta sit virga percutiens te, nam ex radice serpentis exivit basiliscus, cujus fructus prester volans, Cap. <a href="3927/isaiah_14_29.htm">14:29</a>; <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
et explicui id per sensum spiritualem, quod per Philisthaeam intelligatur Ecclesia separata a charitate; quod per basiliscum qui ex radice serpentis exivit, intelligatur doctrina ejus de tribus Diis, et de fide imputativa cuivis singulatim applicata, et quod per fructum ejus qui est prester volans, intelligatur nulla imputatio boni et mali, sed immediata Misericordia sive homo bene sive male vixerit.</p>

[5] His auditis dixerunt, sit hoc, sed ex Codice illo, quem vocas Sanctum Verbum, exprome aliquid de Praedestinatione, et aperui, et apud Eundem Prophetam offendi hoc quod concordabat, "Ova aspidis ponebant, et telas araneae texebant; qui comedit ex ovis illorum, moritur, et quando quis exprimit, excluditur vipera," Cap. <a href="3927/isaiah_59_5.htm">59:5</a>his auditis non sustinuerunt explicationem, sed aliqui ex illis, qui arcessiti sunt, erant quinque, proripuerunt se in Antrum, circum quod apparuit furve ignitum, signum quod non fides nec charitas illis. Ex his patet, quod Decretum <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
Synodicum illud de Praedestinatione, non modo sit Haeresis insana, sed etiam Haeresis crudelis; quare eradicanda est e Cerebro adeo, ut ne quidem unus apex ejus residuus sit.<p>
