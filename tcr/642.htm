642. In the decrees of the councils and the articles of the confessions that Protestants swear to observe, we read that through an infusion of Christ's merit God justifies the godless. In fact, though, not even the goodness of an angel can be communicated to a godless person, much less joined to that person, without either being rejected and bouncing back like a rubber ball thrown against a solid wall, or being swallowed up like a diamond thrown into a swamp. In fact, forcing something truly good on such a person would be like tying a pearl to the snout of a pig.
<p>Surely everyone realizes that you cannot inject mercy into ruthlessness, or innocence into revenge, or love into hatred, or harmony into discord. Doing so would be like mixing heaven and hell.
<p>People who have not been reborn are, in spirit, like panthers and eagle-owls; they can be compared to brambles and stinging nettles. People who have been reborn are like sheep and doves, and they can be compared to olive trees and grapevines. Please consider, if you will, how panther-people could possibly be converted into sheep-people, or eagle-owls into doves, or brambles into olive trees, or stinging nettles into grapevines, through any assignment or attribution or application of divine justice. Would that process not sooner condemn them than justify them? In reality, in order for that conversion to take place the predatory nature of the panther and the eagle-owl and the damaging nature of the brambles and the stinging nettles must first be removed and something truly human and harmless implanted in their place. The Lord in fact teaches in <a href="3927/john_15_1.htm">John 15:1-7</a> how this transformation occurs. </p>

642. The decrees of the Councils and the articles of the Confessions which the members of Reformed churches swear to uphold state that God justifies the ungodly man by infusing into him Christ's merit. Yet the good of any angel cannot be shared with, much less linked to an ungodly person, without being rejected and bouncing back like a rubber ball thrown against a wall, or without being swallowed up like a diamond dropped into a marsh. In fact, if anything truly good were forced into him, it would be like a pearl tied to the snout of a pig. Everyone knows that compassion cannot be injected into mercilessness, innocence into revenge, love into hatred, concord into discord - it would be like mixing heaven and hell together.<p>A person who has not been born again is, as far as his spirit is concerned, like a panther or an owl, and can be likened to a briar or a nettle. But one who is reborn is like a sheep or a dove, and can be likened to an olive tree or a vine. Just consider, if you please, how a panther-man can be turned into a sheep-man, or an owl into a dove, or a briar into an olive tree or a nettle into a vine, by means of any imputation, attribution or application of Divine righteousness. It would be more likely to damn him than to justify him. Surely if anything is to be turned into anything else, the bestiality of the panther and the owl, or the harmfulness of the briar and nettle, must first be removed, and in its stead what is truly human and harmless implanted? How this may be is also taught by the Lord in John (<a href="3927/john_15_1.htm">John 15:1-7</a>). </p>

642. In the decrees of the Councils and in the articles of the Confessions to which the Reformed make oath, it is declared that God justifies the wicked man by means of the merit of Christ infused into him, when, in fact, not even the good of any angel can be communicated to a wicked person, still less conjoined to him, without being thrown back and rebounding like an elastic ball thrown against a wall, or swallowed up like a diamond sunk in a marsh; and indeed, if anything truly good was thrust upon him, it would be like a pearl fastened to a swine's snout. For who does not know that clemency cannot be introduced into unmercifulness, innocence into vindictiveness, love into hatred, or concord into discord, which would be like mixing together heaven and hell? The man who has not been born again, is in the spirit like a panther or an owl, and may be likened to a thorn or a nettle; while the man who has been born again is like a sheep or a dove, and may be likened to an olive tree or a vine. Reflect, I pray you, if you will, how a human panther can be converted into a human sheep, or an owl into a dove, or a thorn tree into an olive tree, or a nettle into a vine, by any imputation, ascription, or application of the Divine righteousness, which would rather damn than justify him. Before such a conversion could take place, must not the ferine nature of the panther and owl, or the noxious qualities of the thorn and nettle first be taken away, and what is truly human and harmless be implanted in their place? How this is effected the Lord also teaches in John (<a href="3927/john_15_1.htm">15:1-7</a>). </p>

642. Dicitur in Decretis Conciliorum et in Articulis Confessionum, in quos Reformati jurant, quod Deus per meritum Christi infusum justificet impium, cum tamen impio ne quidem communicari, minus conjungi potest bonum alicujus Angeli, quin rejiciatur et resiliat sicut globus elasticus conjectus in parietem, aut absorbeatur sicut adamas immissa in paludem, imo si aliquod vere bonum intruderetur, foret sicut margarita alligaretur naribus porci; nam quis non scit, quod clementia non possit injici in immisericordiam, innocentia in vindictam, amor in odium, concordia in discordiam, quod foret sicut commiscere Coelum et Infernum: homo non renatus est quoad spiritum suum sicut panthera aut sicut bubo, et assimilari potest senti et urticae, at homo renatus est sicut ovis aut sicut columba, et assimilari potest oleae aut viti; cogitate, quaeso, si libet, quomodo potest homo panthera converti in hominem ovem, aut bubo in columbam, aut sentis in oleam, aut urtica in vitem, per aliquam imputationem, addicationem, applicationem Divinae justitiae, quae potius illum damnaret, quam justificaret; annon ut conversio fiat, ferinum pantherae et bubonis, aut noxium sentis et urticae, prius auferendum est, et loco ejus vere humanum et innocuum implantandum est: quomodo hoc fit, etiam docet Dominus apud <a href="3927/john_15_1.htm">Johannem 15:1-7</a>. </p>
