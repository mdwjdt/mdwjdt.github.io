<h3 align="center" class="ired">真实的基督教 第125节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><b>125</b>.耶和华神只能凭祂的人身才能进入，并完成这样的工作。这一点可通过各种比方来说明。如，一个看不见的人无法与别人握手或交谈，除非他能看见；同样，天使或灵人无法与人互动，哪怕站在他们身边，就在他面前。人的灵魂若不借助肉身，也无法与别人交谈或共事。太阳及其光和热只有通过进入空气，并经由空气作工才能进入人类、动物或树木；或只有凭借水才能进入鱼类，因为它必须通过这个主体所在的元素起作用。没有刀，怎么刮鱼鳞？不用手指，怎么拔乌鸦毛？没有潜水器，怎么潜入湖底？总之，任何事物在与别的事物交流，或与它合作，或反对它之前，必须先适应它。</p>

125. 耶和華上帝若不是取了肉身, 無法完成這些行動。可用幾個例子作比:例如, 一個看不見的人無法與一個可見之人握手或談話。天人和靈無法與我們握手或談話, 哪怕他們就在我們身體邊上或面前。沒有哪個人的靈魂不通過他的身體,能與其他任何人談話與做其它任何事情。太陽不能傳送它的光與熱給任何人,除非先進入空氣並通過空氣傳送。它也不能傳送光與熱給任何魚,除非通過水來完成。如果我們沒有手指, 沒有哪個能用刀刮魚鱗。若不帶著潛水器, 無人能潛到深湖的湖底。簡言之, 在兩者能交流和工作(不管是相同還是相對)之前, 其中一物必需與另外一物相稱。 </p>

125. Jehovah God could not have taken these actions and made them effective without a human manifestation, as various comparisons can illustrate.
<p>An invisible person cannot shake hands or talk with a visible one. In fact, angels and spirits cannot shake hands or talk with us even when they are standing right next to our bodies or in front of our faces. No one's soul can talk, or do things, with anyone else except through its own body. The sun cannot convey its light and heat into any human, animal, or tree, unless it first enters the air and acts through that. It cannot convey its light and heat to any fish unless it passes through the water. It has to act through the element the entity is in. None of us could scale a fish with a knife or pluck a raven's feathers if we had no fingers. We cannot go to the bottom of a deep lake without a diving bell. In a word, one thing needs to be adapted to another before the two can communicate and work with or against each other. </p>

125. Various comparisons may be used as illustrations of the fact that Jehovah God could not set in motion and produce such results except through His Human. For instance, an invisible man cannot shake hands with or talk to anyone except someone who is visible; not even an angel or a spirit can do so with a person, although he stands next to him or right before his face. Neither can anyone's soul talk or deal with another person, except by means of his own body. The sun cannot penetrate any person, animal or tree with its light and heat, unless it first penetrates the air and acts through it; likewise it cannot affect fish except through water.. It must act through the element in which the subject is. No more can anyone take the scales off a fish without <sup "fn10_1">1</sup>
a knife, or pluck a crow without fingers; or go down into the depths of a lake without a diving bell. In short, each thing must be suited to the other before communication can be established, and work can be done either against or with it.<p>

125. That Jehovah God could have entered upon and have accomplished such a work only by means of His Human may be illustrated by various comparisons; as, that one who is invisible cannot shake hands or converse with another until he becomes visible; thus an angel or spirit could have no interaction with a man, even if standing close to his body and before his face. Neither can anyone's soul converse with another or act with another except by means of his body. The sun with its light and heat can enter into man, beast, or tree only by first entering the air and operating through it; or can enter into a fish only by means of the water, since it must act through that element in which the subject resides. No one can scale a fish without a knife, or pluck a crow without fingers; or descend to the bottom of a lake without a diving-bell; in a word, any one thing must be adapted to another before it can communicate with it or operate with it or against it. </p>

125. That Jehovah God could not have entered upon and accomplished these operations except by His Human, may be illustrated by various comparisons; as, for example, one who is invisible cannot shake hands or converse except with one who is visible; nor can angels and spirits with a man, even though they stood beside him and before his face. The soul of any one cannot converse and act with another except by means of his body. The sun cannot influence with its light and heat any man, animal or plant, if it did not first enter the air, and act through it. Similarly it cannot affect fish except through water; for it acts through the medium of the element in which the subject lives. No one can scale a fish with a knife, or pluck a crow, without fingers, or descend to the bottom of a lake without a diving-bell. In short, one thing must be accommodated to another before any communication is made or interaction set up between them. </p>

125. Quod Jehovah Deus non potuerit talia nisi per Humanum suum in actum mittere et efficere, illustrari potest per varias comparationes; ut quod inconspicuus non possit conserere manus, nec loquelam, cum conspicuo; <sup "fn120_1">1</sup>
ne quidem angelus et spiritus cum homine, tametsi juxta corpus ejus et ante faciem ejus staret. Nec potest alicujus anima cum aliquo loqui et agere nisi per suum corpus. Non potest Sol cum sua luce et suo calore intrare in aliquem hominem, bestiam et arborem, nisi prius intret aerem, et per hunc agat; similiter nec in pisces nisi per aquas; aget enim per elementum, in quo subjectum <sup "fn120_2">2</sup>
est. Ne quidem potest aliquis desquamare piscem cultro, <sup "fn120_3">3</sup>
et deplumare corvum, absque digitis; nec descendere in profundum lacus absque campana urinatoria; verbo, unumquodvis accommodatum erit alteri, antequam fit communicatio, et operatio contra illum aut cum illo.<p>
