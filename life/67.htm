<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">八、任何人避各种杀人如罪到何等程度，就在何等程度上拥有对邻之爱</h4><p>Life67.“各种杀人”包括敌意，仇恨和各种报复，这些东西都渴望杀人，因为杀人就隐藏在它们里面，就像灰烬之下木头里的火。地狱之火不是别的，这就是“怒火中烧”和“复仇之火”这些说法的起源。这些是属世意义上的“杀人”；但就属灵意义而言，“杀人”表示杀害并摧毁人们灵魂的一切方法，这些方法有很多，并且各种各样。就至高意义而言，“杀人”表示仇恨主。这三种杀人形成一体，紧密联系在一起；因为凡意愿杀世人肉体的，死后就会意愿杀其灵魂，并意愿杀主，因为他对主怒火中烧，渴望涂抹主的名。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 67</h4><p>67. To the Extent That We Turn Our Backs on All Kinds of Killing Because They Are Sins, We Have Love for Our Neighbor<p>ALL kinds of killing means all kinds of hostility, hatred, and vengefulness, which yearn for murder. Killing lies hidden within such attitudes like fire that smolders beneath the ashes. That is exactly what hellfire is. It is why we say that people are on fire with hatred and burning for vengeance. These are types of killing in an earthly sense; but in a spiritual sense "killing" means all of the many and varied ways of killing and destroying people's souls. Then in the highest sense it means harboring hatred for the Lord.<p>These three kinds of killing align and are united, since anyone who intends the physical murder of someone in this world intends the murder of that individual's soul after death and intends the murder of the Lord, actually burning with hatred against him and wanting to eradicate his name. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 67</h4><p>67. Insofar as Someone Refrains from Every Form of Murder as a Sin, So Far He Has Love for the Neighbor<p>By every form of murder we mean also every instance of enmity, hatred and vengeance with a longing to kill, for murder lies concealed within these, like fire in wood under the ashes. Nor is the fire of hell anything else. It is owing to this that we speak of someone’s seething with hatred or burning for revenge. These forms of murder are murder in the natural sense.<p>By murder in the spiritual sense, then, we mean all the ways of killing or destroying people’s souls, which are various and many. And by murder in the highest sense we mean hatred of the Lord.<p>These three kinds of murder go together and are inseparable. For someone who wishes the death of a person’s body in the world, after death wishes the death of his soul. He also wishes the death of the Lord, for he burns with anger at Him and wishes to blot out His name. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 67 </h4>
<p>67. VIII. SO FAR AS ANY ONE SHUNS ALL KINDS OF MURDER AS SINS, SO FAR HE HAS LOVE TOWARDS THE NEIGHBOUR
<p>By all kinds of murder are meant also all kinds of enmity, hatred, and revenge, which breathe a murderous purpose, for in them murder lies concealed, as fire in wood beneath the ashes. Infernal fire is nothing else; and hence come the expressions, to be inflamed with hatred and to burn with revenge. This is murder in the natural sense. But in the spiritual sense, murder means every method of killing and destroying the souls of men; and these methods are varied and manifold. In the supreme sense, however, by murder is meant to hate the Lord. These three kinds of murder make one and are closely linked together; for whoever wills to kill the body of a man in the world, wills also to kill his soul after death. He also wills to kill the Lord, for he burns with anger against Him and desires to blot out His name. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 67</h4><p>67. IN PROPORTION AS ANYONE SHUNS MURDERS OF EVERY KIND AS SINS, IN THE SAME PROPORTION HE HAS LOVE TOWARD THE NEIGHBOR.<p>"Murders of every kind" include enmity, hatred, and revenge of every kind, which breathe murder, for murder lies hidden in them, like fire in wood underneath the ashes. Infernal fire is nothing else, and this is the origin of the expressions to "kindle with hatred," and to "burn with revenge." All these are "murders" in the natural sense. But in the spiritual sense "murders" mean all methods of killing and destroying the souls of men, which methods are varied and many. And in the highest sense "murder" means to hate the Lord. These three kinds of "murder" form a one, and cleave together, for he who wills the murder of a man's body in this world, after death wills the murder of his soul, and wills the murder of the Lord, for he burns with anger against Him, and desires to blot out His name. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 67 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>67. (VIII.) QUOD QUANTUM QUIS OMNIS GENERIS HOMICIDIA UT PECCATA FUGIT, TANTUM AMOREM ERGA PROXIMUM HABEAT. <p>Per omnis generis homicidia, intelliguntur etiam omnis generis inimicitiae, odia et vindictae, quae spirant necem; in illis enim latet homicidium, sicut ignis in ligno sub cinere; ignis infernalis nec aliud est; ex eo est, quod dicatur ardescere odio et flagrare vindicta: haec sunt homicidia in naturali sensu. Per homicidia autem in spirituali sensu, intelliguntur omnes modi occidendi et perdendi animas hominum, qui sunt varii et multiplices. Per homicidium autem in supremo sensu intelligitur odio habere Dominum. Haec tria genera homicidiorum unum faciunt et cohaerent; nam qui vult necem corporis hominis in mundo, is vult necem animae ejus post mortem; et vult necem Domini, flagrat enim ira contra Ipsum et vult nomen Ipsius exstinguere. </p>
