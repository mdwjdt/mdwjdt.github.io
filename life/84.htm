<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》 第84节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life84.圣言中有许多经文说到这一点，其中有以下经文：</p>
<p>行在公义中，说话正直，憎恶欺压的财利，摆手不受贿赂，塞耳不听流血的话，闭眼不看邪恶事的，他必居高处。（以赛亚书33:15-16）</p>
<p>耶和华啊，谁能居于你的帐幕？谁能住在你的圣山？就是行走正直，做事公义，不以舌头谗谤人，不恶待同伴的。（诗篇15:1-3等）</p>
<p>我眼要看顾地上忠信的人，使他们与我同住；行正直路的，他要侍候我。行诡诈的，必不得住在我家中间；说谎言的，必不得立在我眼前。黎明时分我要剪灭地上所有的恶人，把一切作孽的从城里剪除。（诗篇101:6-8）</p>
<p>主以下面这些话教导我们，人若非从内在是诚实、公正、忠信、正直的，就是不诚实、不公正、不忠信、不正直的：</p>
<p>你们的义若不胜于文士和法利赛人的义，断不能进天国。（马太福音5:10）</p>
<p>“胜于文士和法利赛人的义”表示在主里面的人所处的内在公义。主自己在约翰福音中教导，这等人在主里面：</p>
<p>我在他们里面，你在我里面，使他们完完全全地合而为一；使你所爱我的爱在他们里面，我也在他们里面。（约翰福音17:22-23，26）</p>
<p>由此明显可知，当主在他们里面时，他们便“完全”了。他们就是那些被称为“心里洁净，必得见神”的人，也是那些“像他们的天父一样完全”的人（马太福音5:8，48）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 84</h4><p>84. There are many passages in the Word that say this, the following being a few of them:<p>Those who walk in righteousness and say what is upright, who loathe oppression for the sake of profit, who shake bribes from their hands in order not to accept them, who block their ears so as not to hear bloodshed, who close their eyes so as not to see evil - they will dwell on high. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_33_15.htm">Isaiah 33:15-16</a>)<p>Jehovah, who will dwell in your tabernacle? Who will live on your holy mountain? Those who walk uprightly and do what is fair, who do not disparage others with their tongues, and who do no evil to their companions. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_15_1.htm">Psalms 15:1-3</a>, and following)<p>My eyes are toward the faithful of the earth so that they may sit down with me. Anyone who walks the path of integrity will serve me. No one who practices deceit will sit in the midst of my house; no one who speaks lies will stand in my presence. At dawn I will cut off all the ungodly of the earth, to cut off from the city all those who work iniquity. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_101_6.htm">Psalms 101:6-8</a>)<p>In the following words, the Lord tells us that we are not truly honest, fair, faithful, or upright until we are inwardly honest, fair, faithful, and upright:<p>Unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of the heavens. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_20.htm">Matthew 5:20</a>)<p>Righteousness that exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees means the more inward righteousness that is ours when we are in the Lord. As for our being "in the Lord, " he also teaches this in John:<p>The glory that you gave me I have given them, so that they may be one just as we are one - I in them and you in me - so that they may be made perfect in one, and so that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I may be in them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_22.htm">John 17:22-23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>)<p>This shows that people become complete when the Lord is in them. These are the people who are called "pure in heart, " the ones who "will see God, " and the ones who are "perfect, like their Father in the heavens" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_48.htm">48</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 84</h4><p>84. This is something the Word teaches in many places, among which are the following:<p>He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly, who despises oppressions for the sake of gain, who shakes his hands so as not to accept a bribe, who stops his ears so as not to hear of blood money, and shuts his eyes so as not to see evil: he will dwell on high. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_33_15.htm">Isaiah 33:15-16</a>)<p>Jehovah, who may abide in Your tabernacle? Who may dwell on Your holy mountain? He who walks uprightly and acts righteously..., who does not slander with his tongue, who does no evil to his companion.... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_15_1.htm">Psalms 15:1-3</a>ff.)<p>My eyes shall be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with Me; he who walks on a path of integrity, he shall serve Me. He who practices deceit shall not dwell within My house; he who tells lies shall not stand in My presence. At dawn I will cut off all the impious of the land, in order to cut off from the city...all workers of iniquity. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_101_6.htm">Psalms 101:6-8</a>)</p><p>[2] Unless someone is inwardly honest, just, trustworthy and upright, he remains dishonest, unjust, untrustworthy, and not upright. This the Lord teaches in these words:<p>...unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_20.htm">Matthew 5:20</a>) Righteousness exceeding that of the scribes and Pharisees means an inner righteousness, which is the righteousness a person has who is in the Lord.<p>That he is in the Lord is something the Lord Himself teaches in John:<p>The glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one, I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into a one..., that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_22.htm">John 17:22-23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>) It is apparent from this that those people are perfected when the Lord is in them.<p>Those are the people called the pure in heart who shall see God, and are perfect, even as their Father in heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_48.htm">48</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 84 </h4>
<p>84. The Word teaches this in many places, of which the following are examples:
<p>He that walketh in righteousness and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth oppression for gain, that shaketh his hands from holding a bribe; that stoppeth his ears from hearing bloods, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;
<p>He shall dwell on high. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_33_15.htm">Isaiah 33:15-16</a>.
<p>Jehovah, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
<p>He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness ...
<p>He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_15_1.htm">Psalms 15:1-3</a>.
<p>Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.
<p>He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.
<p>I will in the morning destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_101_6.htm">Psalms 101:6-8</a>.
<p>Unless a man is inwardly sincere, just, faithful and upright, he still remains insincere, unjust, unfaithful and not upright. This the Lord teaches in these words:
<p>Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_20.htm">Matthew 5:20</a>.
<p>By the righteousness that exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, is meant interior righteousness in which the man is principled who is in the Lord. That such a man is in the Lord, He Himself teaches in John:
<p>The glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one, even as we are one:
<p>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one...
<p>That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_22.htm">John 17:22-23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>.
<p>From this it is evident that they are perfect when the Lord is in them. These are they who are called
<p>The pure in heart, who shall see God; and, the perfect, as their Father which is in heaven. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_48.htm">48</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 84</h4><p>84. This is taught by the Word in many passages, among which are the following:<p>He that walketh in righteousnesses, and speaketh uprightnesses; he that despiseth oppressions for gain, that shaketh his hands from holding bribes, that stoppeth his ears from the hearing of bloods, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; he shall dwell on high (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_33_15.htm">Isaiah 33:15-16</a>).<p>Jehovah, who shall abide in Thy tent? who shall dwell in the mountain of Thy holiness? He that walketh uprightly, and doeth righteousness; he that slandereth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his companion (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_15_1.htm">Psalms 15:1-3</a>, etc.).<p>Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with Me he that walketh in the way of the upright, he shall minister unto Me. He that worketh deceit shall not dwell in the midst of My house; he that speaketh lies shall not stand before Mine eyes. In the dawning will I cut off all the wicked of the land, to cut off from the city all the workers of iniquity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_101_6.htm">Psalms 101:6-8</a>).<p>That unless a man is interiorly sincere, just, faithful, and upright, he is insincere, unjust, unfaithful, and base, is taught by the Lord in these words:<p>Except your righteousness shall exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of the heavens (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_10.htm">Matthew 5:10</a>).<p>The "righteousness that exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees" means the interior righteousness in which is the man who is in the Lord. That he is in the Lord is taught by the Lord Himself in John:<p>The glory which Thou hast given Me I have given unto them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be perfected into one; that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_22.htm">John 17:22-23</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>).<p>From this it is evident that they are "perfect" when the Lord is in them. These are they who are called:<p>The pure in heart, who shall see God and, Those who are perfect as is their Father in the heavens (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_48.htm">48</a>). </p>
