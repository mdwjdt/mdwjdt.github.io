<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">三、一个人避恶如罪到何等程度，就在何等程度上不是从自己，而是从神行善</h4><p>Life18.谁不知道，或不能知道，邪恶阻止主进入人？因为邪恶是地狱，主是天堂，地狱与天堂是对立面。因此，一个人在这一个里面到何等程度，就在何等程度上无法在那一个里面；因为这一个会反对并摧毁那一个。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 18</h4><p>18. To the Extent That We Turn Our Backs on Evil Deeds Because They Are Sins, the Good Deeds We Do Come Not from Ourselves but from the Lord<p>IS there anyone who does not and cannot know that our evils stand in the way of the Lord's ability to come in to us? Evil is hell and the Lord is heaven, and hell and heaven are opposites; so to the extent that we are in one we cannot be in the other. One acts against the other and cancels it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 18</h4><p>18. Insofar as a Person Refrains from Evils as Being Sins, So Far He Does Good, Not of Himself, but from the Lord<p>Who does not know, or who cannot know, that evils impede the Lord’s being able to enter a person? For evil embodies hell, and the Lord embodies heaven, and hell and heaven are opposed to each other. Insofar as a person is engaged in one, therefore, so far he cannot be engaged in the other. For one acts in opposition to the other and destroys it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 18 </h4>
<p>18. III. SO FAR AS A MAN SHUNS EVILS AS SINS, SO FAR HE DOES WHAT IS GOOD NOT FROM HIMSELF, BUT FROM THE LORD
<p>Who does not know, or may not know, that evils prevent the Lord's entrance into man? For evil is hell, and the Lord is heaven, and hell and heaven are opposites; so far therefore as man is in one, so far he cannot be in the other; for one acts against and destroys the other. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 18</h4><p>18. IN PROPORTION AS A MAN SHUNS EVILS AS SINS, IN THE SAME PROPORTION HE DOES GOODS, NOT FROM HIMSELF BUT FROM THE LORD.<p>Who does not or may not know that evils stand in the way of the Lord's entrance to a man? For evil is hell, and the Lord is heaven, and hell and heaven are opposites. In proportion therefore as a man is in the one, in the same proportion he cannot be in the other. For the one acts against the other and destroys it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 18 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>18. (III.) QUOD QUANTUM HOMO FUGIT MALA UT PECCATA, TANTUM FACIAT BONA NON A SE, SED A DOMINO. <p>Quis non scit et scire potest, quod mala impediant, quin Dominus ad hominem intrare possit? Malum enim est infernum, et Dominus est caelum, ac infernum et caelum opposita sunt; quantum itaque homo est in uno, tantum non potest esse in altero; unum enim agit contra alterum, et destruit. </p>
