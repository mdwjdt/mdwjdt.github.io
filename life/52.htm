<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life52.从这些前提可以得出以下结论：人里面的真理不会多于他里面的良善一丁点，因而他里面的信仰不会多于他里面的生命一丁点。事实上，理解力里面可能存在某事是真的这种思维，但不可能存在等同于信仰的承认，除非意愿里面有同意。因此，信仰和生活是并肩而行的。由此明显可知，人避恶如罪到何等程度，就在何等程度上拥有信仰并属灵。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 52</h4><p>52. The conclusion follows from this that there is not the slightest bit more of truth in us than there is of what is good, so there is not the slightest bit more of faith than there is of life. The knowledge that something is so may exist in our understanding, but unless our will agrees, that knowledge is not the acknowledgment that constitutes faith. So faith and life walk side by side.<p>This now allows us to see that to the extent we turn our backs on evils because they are sins, we have faith and are spiritual. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 52</h4><p>52. It follows as a conclusion from this that no one has in him a grain of truth more than the goodness in him, thus not a grain of faith more than the life he lives. Thought that something is so may exist in the intellect, but it is without the acknowledgment that constitutes faith unless it is consented to in the will. Thus faith and life go together at every step.<p>It is now apparent from this that insofar as someone refrains from evils as being sins, so far he has faith and is spiritual. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 52 </h4>
<p>52. From these considerations the conclusion follows, that there is not with man a grain of truth more than there is good; and consequently not a grain of faith more than there is life. There may be in the understanding the thought that a thing is so, but not the acknowledgment amounting to faith, unless there is concurrence in the will. Thus do faith and life proceed together step by step. From these considerations then it is evident that so far as any one shuns evils as sins, so far he has faith, and is spiritual. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 52</h4><p>52. From these premises there follows this conclusion: - That no man has in him a grain of truth more than he has of good; thus that he has not a grain of faith more than he has of life. In the understanding indeed there may exist the thought that such or such a thing is true, but not the acknowledgment which is faith, unless there is consent thereto in the will. Thus do faith and life keep step as they walk. From all this it is now evident that in proportion as anyone shuns evils as sins, in the same proportion he has faith and is spiritual. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 52 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>52. Conclusum ex his sequitur, quod apud hominem non detur granum veri plus quam datur bonum; ita non granum fidei plus quam datur vita. Datur cogitatio quod ita sit, in intellectu, sed non agnitio quae fides, nisi detur consensus in voluntate. Ita fides et vita pari passu ambulant. Ex his nunc patet quod quantum quis fugit mala ut peccata, tantum fidem habeat, et spiritualis sit. </p>
