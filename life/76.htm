<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life76.没有人能知道婚姻的贞洁是何性质，除非他避奸淫的淫乱如罪。因为一个人能知道他所经历的事，却无法知道他所没有经历的事。一个人若知道他未曾经历的某种东西，并且是基于对它的描述或思考知道的，就仅仅是在暗中知道它，对它仍存有某种怀疑。因此，在没有实际经历之前，没有人在光中看见任何东西，并免除怀疑。这后一种情况就是知道，而另一种情况是知道，却又不知道。这个问题的真相是：奸淫的淫乱与婚姻的贞洁就像地狱与天堂一样彼此有别；奸淫的淫乱构成一个人里面的地狱，婚姻的贞洁构成天堂。但婚姻的贞洁唯独存在于避奸淫的淫乱如避罪的人身上（参看111节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 76</h4><p>76. We cannot know the true nature of the chastity of marriage if we do not turn our backs on the lechery of adultery as a sin. We can know something we have experienced, but not something that we have not experienced. If we know about something we have not experienced, know it on the basis of a description or by thinking about it, we know it only in the shadows, and doubt clings to it. So we see it in the light and without doubt only when we have experienced it. This is knowing, then; the other is knowing and yet not knowing.<p>The truth of the matter is that the lechery of adultery and the chastity of marriage are as different from each other as hell and heaven are from each other, and that the lechery of adultery makes hell for us and the chastity of marriage makes heaven for us.<p>However, there is no chastity of marriage for anyone but those who turn their backs on adultery as a sin - see <a href="../life/111.htm">111</a> below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 76</h4><p>76. No one can know what the chasteness of marriage is like unless he refrains from the lasciviousness of adultery as being a sin. A person may know the state he is in, but he cannot know a state in which he is not. If, from a description of it or from thinking about it, he knows something of a state in which he is not, still he knows only a shadow of it, and some uncertainty remains. Consequently he does not see it in clear light and free of uncertainty until he is in it. It is then that he knows it, while before it is to know and not know.<p>The truth is that the lasciviousness of adultery and the chasteness of marriage stand in relation to each other precisely in the same way as hell and heaven. Moreover, the lasciviousness of adultery creates a hell in a person, while the chasteness of marriage creates a heaven in him.<p>Still, the chasteness of marriage is experienced only by someone who refrains from the lasciviousness of adultery as being a sin. See no. <a href="../life/111.htm">111</a> below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 76 </h4>
<p>76. No one can know what the chastity of marriage is, unless he shuns the lasciviousness of adultery as sin. A man may know that in which he is, but he cannot know that in which he is not. If from description or thought he knows something in which he is not, still he knows it only as something in the shade, and uncertainty adheres to it. Therefore he does not see it in the light and free from uncertainty, as when he experiences it; and so this is to know, but the other is to know and yet not to know. It is a truth that the lasciviousness of adultery and the chastity of marriage are to each other just as hell and heaven are to each other; and that the lasciviousness of adultery makes hell with man, and the chastity of marriage makes heaven with him. However, the chastity of marriage is only possible with the man who shuns the lasciviousness of adultery as sin. See below, No. <a href="111.htm">111</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 76</h4><p>76. No one can know the nature of the chastity of marriage except the man who shuns as a sin the lasciviousness of adultery. For a man may know that in which he is, but cannot know that in which he is not. If from description or from thinking about it a man knows something in which he is not, he nevertheless knows of it merely as of something in the dark, and there remains some doubt about it, so that no one sees anything in the light and free from doubt until he is actually in it. This last therefore is to know, whereas the other is both to know and not to know. The truth is that the lasciviousness of adultery and the chastity of marriage stand toward each other exactly as do hell and heaven, and that the lasciviousness of adultery makes hell in a man, and the chastity of marriage makes heaven. But the chastity of marriage exists solely with the man who shuns as sin the lasciviousness of adultery. (See below, n. 111.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 76 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>76. Non potest quisquam scire qualis est castitas conjugii, nisi qui fugit lasciviam adulterii ut peccatum. Homo scire potest in quo est, sed non potest scire in quo non est. Si scit aliquid in quo non est ex descriptione aut ex cogitatione, usque non scit id aliter quam in umbra, ac inhaeret dubium; quare non illud videt in luce et absque dubio, quam cum in illo est. Hoc itaque est scire, illud autem est scire et non scire. Veritas est, quod lascivia adulterii et castitas conjugii inter se sint prorsus sicut infernum et caelum inter se; et quod lascivia adulterii faciat infernum apud hominem, et castitas conjugii caelum apud illum. Sed non datur castitas conjugii apud alium, quam qui fugit lasciviam adulterii sicut peccatum (videatur infra,<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_76/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_111">111</a>). </p>
