<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life29.圣言教导，没有人能从自己行善，只能从主行善：</p>
<p>耶稣说，我是真葡萄树，我父是修剪葡萄树的；凡在我里面不结果子的枝子，祂就剪去，凡结果子的，祂就修理干净，使枝子结果子更多。你们要住在我里面，我也住在你们里面。枝子若不住在葡萄树上，自己就不能结果子。你们若不住在我里面，也是这样。我是葡萄树，你们是枝子；住在我里面的，我也住在他里面，这人就多结果子。因为离了我，你们就不能做什么。人若不住在我里面，就像枝子丢在外面枯干，人拾起来，扔在火里烧了。（约翰福音15:1-6）</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 29</h4><p>29. The Word tells us that none of us can do what is good on our own; our actions are good only if they come from the Lord.<p>Jesus said, "I am the vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away; and every branch that bears fruit he prunes, so that it will bear more fruit. Abide in me, and I [will abide] in you. As a branch cannot bear fruit on its own unless it abides in the vine, the same goes for you unless you abide in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Those who abide in me and in whom I abide bear much fruit, because without me you cannot do anything. If any do not abide in me they are cast out as branches and wither; people gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_1.htm">John 15:1-6</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 29</h4><p>29. The Word teaches that no one can do good of himself, but only from the Lord. Jesus said:<p>I am the...vine, and My Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away; but every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit.... Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather it and throw it into the fire, and it is burned. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_1.htm">John 15:1-6</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 29 </h4>
<p>29. The Word teaches also that no one can do good from himself, but from the Lord. Jesus said: I am the [true] vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
<p>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit He taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit, He purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit....
<p>Abide in me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.
<p>I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.
<p>If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather it, and cast it into the fire, and it is burned. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_1.htm">John 15:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">4-6</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 29</h4><p>29. The Word teaches that no one can do what is good from himself, but that he does it from the Lord:<p>Jesus said, I am the true vine, and My Father is the vine-dresser. Every branch in Me that beareth not fruit He taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit He cleanseth it, that it may bear more fruit. Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, so neither can ye except ye abide in Me. I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit; for without Me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in Me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and they gather him, and cast him into the fire, and he is burned (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_1.htm">John 15:1-6</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 29 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>29. Verbum docet, quod nemo possit bonum facere a se, sed a Domino. Dixit Jesus, <p>"Ego sum Vitis..., et Pater meus Vinitor: omnem palmitem in Me non ferentem fructum, tollit illum: omnem autem fructum ferentem, putabit illum, ut plus fructus ferat. Manete in Me, etiam Ego in vobis: quemadmodum palmes non potest ferre fructum a se ipso" nisi manserit in vite, ita neque vos, nisi in Me manseritis. Ego sum Vitis, vos palmites; qui manet in Me, et Ego in illo, hic fert fructum multum; quia sine Me, non potestis facere quicquam. Nisi quis manserit in Me, ejectus est foras sicut palmes, et arefactus est, et colligunt illum, et in ignem conjiciunt, et comburitur" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_29/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_1-6">Johannes 15:1-6</a>). </p>
