<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">一、一切宗教都与生活有关，宗教生活就是行善</h4><p>Life1.凡拥有宗教的人都知道并承认，过着良善生活的人会得救，过着邪恶生活的人会受到诅咒；因为他知道并承认，过着良善生活的人，不仅对神，也对邻舍思想善事；过着邪恶生活的人则不然。人的生命就是他的爱，凡他喜欢的，他不仅愿意去做，还愿意去思想。我们之所以说，生命在于行善事，是因为行善事与思想善事行如一体。这两件事若不在一个人里面行如一体，就不是他生命的一部分。有必要在下文解释这一切。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 1</h4><p>1. Religion Is All about How We Live, and the Religious Way to Live Is to Do Good.<p>EVERYONE who has any religion knows and acknowledges that people who lead a good life are saved and people who lead an evil life are damned. That is, they know and acknowledge that if we lead a good life we think good things not only about God but also about our neighbor, which is not the case if we lead an evil life.<p>What we love constitutes our life, and whatever we love we not only do freely but also think freely. So we say that life is doing good things because doing good things is inseparable from thinking good things. If this doing and this thinking are not working together in us, then they are not part of our life. This, though, needs to be explained in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 1</h4><p>1. Every Religion Is a Way of Life, and Its Life Is the Doing of Good<p>Everyone with any religion knows and acknowledges that someone who lives right is saved, and that someone who does not live right is damned. For he knows and acknowledges that someone who lives right, thinks right, not only about God, but also about the neighbor; but not so someone who does not live right.<p>A person’s life is his love, and what a person loves he not only freely does, but also freely thinks. We say therefore that his life is the doing of good, because doing right accompanies his thinking right. If these two do not go together, they do not constitute a person’s life.<p>But this we will show in the following pages. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 1 </h4>
<p>1. I. ALL RELIGION HAS RELATION TO LIFE, AND THE LIFE OF RELIGION IS TO DO GOOD
<p>Every one who has any religion knows and acknowledges that he who lives well will be saved, and that he who lives wickedly will be condemned; for he knows and acknowledges that he who lives well thinks well, not only concerning God but also concerning the neighbour; but not so he who lives wickedly. The life of man is his love; and what a man loves he not Only does willingly but also thinks willingly. The reason, therefore, why it is said that the life [of religion] is to do good is, because the doing of good unites with the thinking of good; and unless they act in unison in a man, they do not form part of his life. But these things will be demonstrated in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 1</h4><p>1. ALL RELIGION IS OF THE LIFE, AND THE LIFE OF RELIGION IS TO DO THAT WHICH IS GOOD.<p>Every man who has religion knows and acknowledges that he who leads a good life is saved, and that he who leads an evil life is damned; for he knows and acknowledges that the man who lives aright thinks aright, not only about God but also about his neighbor; but not so the man whose life is evil. The life of man is his love, and that which he loves he not only likes to be doing, but also likes to be thinking. The reason therefore why we say that the life is to do that which is good is that doing what is good acts as a one with thinking what is good, for if in a man these two things do not act as a one, they are not of his life. The demonstration of these matters shall now follow. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 1 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>1. DOCTRINA VITAE PRO NOVA HIEROSOLYMA. <p>(I.) QUOD OMNIS RELIGIO SIT VITAE, ET QUOD VITA EJUS SIT FACERE BONUM. <p>Omnis homo, cui est religio, scit et agnoscit, quod qui bene vivit, salvetur, et quod qui male vivit, condemnetur: scit enim et agnoscit, quod, qui bene vivit, bene cogitet, non solum de Deo, sed etiam de proximo; non autem qui male vivit. Vita hominis est ejus amor; et quod homo amat, non modo libenter facit, sed etiam libenter cogitat. Quod itaque dicatur, quod vita sit facere bonum, est quia facere bonum unum agit cum cogitare bonum; quae si non unum agunt apud hominem, non sunt vitae ejus. Sed haec in sequentibus demonstranda sunt. </p>
