<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life54.由于这些律法是圣言的初熟果子，因而是主即将建立在以色列民族当中的教会的初熟果子，还由于它们是使得主与人并人与主的结合成为可能的宗教一切元素的简要概括，所以它们如此神圣，以至于再没有什么比这更神圣的了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 54</h4><p>54. Because these laws were the very beginnings of the Word and therefore of the church that the Lord was establishing with the Israelite people, and because they brought together in a brief summary all the elements of religion that make possible the Lord's union with us and our union with the Lord, they were so holy that nothing is holier. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 54</h4><p>54. These laws were the first ones in the Word, and so the first ones for the church to be established by the Lord with the Israelite nation. And because they embraced in brief summary everything having to do with religion which make possible a conjunction of the Lord with a person, and of a person with the Lord, therefore they were so holy that nothing could be more holy. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 54 </h4>
<p>54. These laws were the first principles of the Word, and consequently the first principles of the Church which was to be established among the Israelitish nation. They were moreover in short summary form an epitome of the whole of religion by which is effected the conjunction of the Lord with man, and of man with the Lord; consequently they were holy above all else. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 54</h4><p>54. As these laws were the first-fruits of the Word, and therefore the first-fruits of the church that was to be again set up by the Lord with the Israelitish nation, and as they were in a brief summary a complex of all those things of religion by means of which there is conjunction of the Lord with man and of man with the Lord, they were so holy that nothing is more so. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 54 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>54. Illae leges quia fuerunt primitiae Verbi, et inde primitiae ecclesiae a Domino apud gentem Israeliticam instaurandae, et quia erant in brevi summario complexus omnium religionis, per quae conjunctio Domini cum homine, et hominis cum Domino, datur, ideo tam sanctae fuerunt, ut nihil sanctius. </p>
