We Need to Abstain from Sinful Evils and Fight against Them As Though We Were Doing So on Our Own<p>IT is part of the divine design that we act in freedom and according to reason, because acting in freedom according to reason is acting on our own.<p>However, these two powers, freedom and reason, are not our own. They are the Lord's within us; and since we are human they are not taken from us, because we cannot be reformed without them. That is, we cannot practice repentance, we cannot fight against evils and as a result bear fruit that is consistent with repentance [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_3_8.htm">Matthew 3:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_3_8.htm">Luke 3:8</a>].<p>So since we are given freedom and reason by the Lord and we act from them, it follows that we are not acting on our own but as though we were on our own. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;[Swedenborg's Footnote] On our being given freedom by the Lord, see <a href="../hh/589.htm">589-596</a>, <a href="../hh/597.htm">597-603</a> in Heaven and Hell.

A Person Must Refrain from Evils as Being Sins and Fight Against Them as Though of Himself<p>It is of Divine order that a person act in freedom in accordance with his reason, since to act in freedom in accordance with one’s reason is to act of oneself.<p>However, these two faculties of freedom and reason are not properly a person’s own, but are the Lord’s in him. And insofar as he is human, they are not taken from him, since without them he cannot be reformed. For without them he cannot repent, cannot fight against evils, and cannot then produce fruits worthy of repentance.<p>Now because a person has his freedom and reason from the Lord, and acts in accordance with them, it follows that he does not act of himself, but as though of himself. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;That a person has his freedom from the Lord may be seen in nos. <a href="../hh/589.htm">Heaven and Hell, nos 589-596</a> and <a href="../hh/597.htm">597-603</a>.

<p>101. XIII. MAN OUGHT TO SHUN EVILS AS SINS, AND TO FIGHT AGAINST THEM, AS OF <sup>1</a></sup>HIMSELF
<p>It is of Divine order that man should act from freedom according to reason, since to act from freedom according to reason is to act from oneself. Nevertheless these two faculties, Freedom and Reason, are not man's own, but are the Lord's within him; and so far as he is a man, they are not taken away from him, since without them he cannot be reformed; for without them he cannot do the work of repentance, he cannot fight against evils, and afterwards bring forth fruits worthy of repentance. Now, since man has freedom and reason from the Lord, and man acts from them, it follows that he does not act from himself, but as from himself.(a)
<p>(a) That man has freedom from the Lord may be seen above Nos. <a href="19.htm">19-20</a>; and in the work on HEAVEN AND HELL Nos. <a href="../hh/589.htm">589-596</a>, <a href="../hh/597.htm">597-603</a>. What freedom is may be seen in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM, published in London, 1758, Nos. <a href="../njhd/141.htm">141-149</a>. Author's Note.

<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 101</h4><p>101. A MAN OUGHT TO SHUN EVILS AS SINS AND FIGHT AGAINST THEM AS OF HIMSELF.<p>It is in accordance with Divine order that man should act in freedom according to reason, because to act in freedom according to reason is to act from himself. And yet these two faculties, Freedom and Reason, are not proper to man, but are the Lord's in him; and in so far as he is a man they must not be taken away from him, because without them he cannot be reformed, for without them he cannot perform repentance, he cannot fight against evils, and afterwards bring forth fruits worthy of repentance. Now as it is from the Lord that man possesses freedom and reason, and as man acts from them, it follows that he does not act from himself, but as from himself. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;That man has freedom from the Lord, see above (n. <a href="../hh/589.htm">Heaven and Hell 589-596</a>, <a href="../hh/597.htm">597-603</a>).
