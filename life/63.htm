<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》 第63节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life63.有一种宗教信条很是盛行，大意是：没有人能守全律法；然而，律法又要求不可杀人、不可奸淫、不可偷盗、不可作假见证。每个文明、道德的人都能通过一种文明、道德的生活守全律法的这些诫命；但这个信条却否认，他能通过一种属灵生活做到这一点。由此可知，他不做这些恶仅仅是为了避免世上的惩罚和损失，而不是为了避免离开这个世界后的惩罚和损失。结果，持守这个信条的人认为，这些邪恶在神眼里是可允许的，但在世人眼里是不可允许的。</p>
<p>由于基于该宗教信条的这种思维，人贪恋这一切邪恶，仅仅为了世界而放弃它们。故死后，这种人虽没有实际犯下杀人、奸淫、偷盗和作假见证的罪，却仍渴望犯下这些罪，并且当他在世上所拥有的外在从他那里被拿走时，就会实际犯下它们。死后他所拥有的每种恶欲都会留在他身上。正因如此，这种人与地狱行如一体，不能不承受和地狱里的人一样的命运。</p>
<p>那些不愿杀人、奸淫、偷盗和作假见证，因为做这些事违反神的人，其命运则截然不同。这些人在与这些邪恶进行某种争战之后，就不意愿它们，也不渴望犯下它们。他们从心里说，它们是罪，本身是属地狱和魔鬼的。死后，当他们为了这个世界所拥有的外在从他们那里被拿走时，就会与天堂行如一体；他们因在主里面，故也进入天堂。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 63</h4><p>63. The prevailing religious belief holds that no one can fulfill the law. And [yet] the law demands that we must not kill, commit adultery, steal, or bear false witness. Any civic and moral individual can fulfill these elements of the law by living a good civic and moral life; but this religious belief denies that we can do so by living a good spiritual life. This leads to the conclusion that our reason for not committing these crimes is simply to avoid punishment and loss in this world, but not to avoid punishment and loss after we leave this world. The result is that people who hold this conviction think that immoral actions are permissible in the eyes of God but not in the eyes of the world.</p><p>[2] Because of the kind of thinking that is based on this religious principle, people have cravings to commit all these evils; for worldly reasons only, they forgo doing them. So even if they have not committed murder, adultery, theft, or false witness, after death people like this still feel the urge to commit such sins; and they actually do when they lose the outer facade they had in the world. All our cravings await us after death. This is why people like this act in concert with hell and cannot help suffering the same fate as people in hell.</p><p>[3] Things turn out differently, though, if we do not want to murder, commit adultery, steal, or bear false witness, because such behavior is contrary to God. Once we have fought against them to some extent we do not intend them, so we feel no urge to do them. We say in our hearts that they are sins, essentially hellish and diabolic. Then after death, when we lose any facade we maintained for worldly reasons, we act in concert with heaven; and because we are focused on the Lord, we also enter heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 63</h4><p>63. A religious tenet has prevailed which maintains that no one can fulfill the law, the law not to kill, commit adultery, steal, or bear false witness. This much of the law every civic and moral person can fulfill in his civic and moral life; but the religious tenet denies that he can do so in his spiritual life. It follows from this that his not doing these things is only to avoid penalties and losses in the world, and not to avoid penalties and losses after he has left the world. As a consequence, the person in whom the aforesaid religion has prevailed thinks these things allowable in the sight of God, but not allowable in the eyes of the world.</p><p>[2] Owing to this way of thinking in accord with his religion, the person possesses an urge to commit all these evils, and refrains from doing them only because of the world. After death, therefore, even if he has not committed murder, adultery, theft or false witness, a person of that character still has an urge to do them, and also does do them when the outer self that he had in the world is taken from him. His every lust awaits a person after death. Because of that, people of this character operate in concert with hell, and cannot but have their lot with the those who are in hell.</p><p>[3] Another lot, however, awaits those who refuse to kill, commit adultery, steal, or bear false witness because to do them is an act against God. After some struggle against them they no longer wish to do them, thus do not have an urge to do them. They say in their heart that they are sins, fundamentally hellish and diabolical. After death, when the outer self that they had in the world is taken from them, they operate in concert with heaven, and because they are in the Lord, they also come into heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 63 </h4>
<p>63. A religious persuasion has prevailed that no one can fulfil the Law; and the Law is, not to kill, not to commit adultery, not to steal, and not to bear false witness. Every civil and moral man can fulfil these precepts of the Law from civil and moral life; but that he can fulfil them from spiritual life this religious persuasion denies. Thus it follows that his abstinence from doing these evils is merely to avoid punishments and losses in the world, and not to avoid punishments and losses after he has left the world. Hence it is that the man with whom the above-mentioned religious persuasion prevails, thinks these evils lawful in the sight of God, but unlawful in the sight of the world.
<p> </p>
<p>[2] On account of this thought, from this religious persuasion of his, the man is in the lust of all these evils, and only refrains from doing them on account of the world. Such a man, therefore, after death, although he had not committed murder, adultery, theft and false witness, still lusts to do them; and further, he does them when the external which he had in the world is taken away from him. Every lust remains with man after death. Hence it is that such persons act in unity with hell, and cannot but have their lot with those who are in hell.
<p> </p>
<p>[3] Another lot, however, awaits those who, because to do these things is against God, do not will to kill, to commit adultery, to steal and to bear false witness. After some combat against these evils they do not will them, and consequently they do not lust to do them, saying in their hearts that they are sins, in themselves infernal and diabolical. These, after death, when the external which they had for use in the world is taken away from them, act in unity with heaven; and because they are in the Lord, they also come into heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 63</h4><p>63. A religious tenet has prevailed to the effect that no one is able to fulfill the law; the law being not to kill, not to commit adultery, not to steal, and not to bear false witness. Every civic man and moral man is able to fulfill these commandments of the law by a civic and moral life; but this tenet denies that he can do so by a spiritual life; from which it follows that his not doing these evils is only for the sake of avoiding penalties and losses in this world, and not for the sake of avoiding penalties and losses after he has left it. It is for this reason that a man with whom this tenet has prevailed, thinks these evils allowable in the sight of God, but not so in that of the world.</p><p>[2] And in consequence of such thought from this his tenet, the man is in concupiscence for all these evils, and refrains from doing them merely for the world's sake; and therefore after death such a man, although he had not committed murders, adulteries, thefts, and false witness, nevertheless desires to commit them, and does commit them when the external possessed by him in this world is taken away from him. Every concupiscence he has had remains with him after death. It is owing to this that such persons act as one with hell, and cannot but have their lot among those who are there.</p><p>[3] Very different is the lot of those who are unwilling to kill, to commit adultery, to steal, and to bear false witness for the reason that to do these things is contrary to God. These persons, after some battling with these evils, do not will them, thus do not desire to commit them: they say in their hearts that they are sins, and in themselves are infernal and devilish. After death, when the external which they had possessed for this world is taken away from them, they act as one with heaven, and as they are in the Lord they come into heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 63 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>63. Invaluit religio, quod nemo possit implere Legem, et Lex est non occidere, non adulterari, non furari, et non false testari. Haec Legis potest unusquisque homo civilis et moralis ex vita civili et morali implere; sed ex vita spirituali, negat illa religio. Ex quo sequitur, quod illa non facere sit modo ad evitandum poenas et jacturas in mundo, et non ad evitandum poenas et jacturas postquam reliquit mundum: inde est, quod homo, apud quem invaluit supra dicta religio, cogitet illa licita coram Deo, sed illicita coram mundo. Propter hanc cogitationem ex sua illa religione homo in concupiscentia est ad omnia illa mala, et solum omittit facere illa propter mundum; quare talis homo post mortem, tametsi non commiserat homicidia, adulteria, furta, et false testatus est, usque concupiscit facere illa, et quoque facit, cum externum, quod in mundo habuit, ei aufertur. Omnis concupiscentia manet hominem post mortem. Ex hoc est, quod tales cum inferno unum agant, et non possint aliter quam sortem habere cum illis qui in inferno sunt. Sed alia sors est illis qui non volunt occidere, adulterari, furari, et false testari, quia illa facere est contra Deum: illi post aliquam pugnam contra illa, non volunt illa, ita non concupiscunt facere illa; dicunt corde suo quod sint peccata, in se infernalia et diabolica: hi post mortem, cum externum, quod pro mundo habuerunt, illis aufertur, cum caelo unum agunt; et quia sunt in Domino, in caelum etiam veniunt. </p>
