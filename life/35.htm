<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life35.诚然，一个不避恶如罪的人也有可能热爱真理。然而，他热爱真理不是因为它们是真理，而是因为它们提高他的声誉，由此有助于他获得地位或利益。因此，如果真理不能提高他的声誉，他就不爱它们。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 35</h4><p>35. Actually, people who do not turn their backs on evils because they are sins can love what is true. However, they do not love it because it is true but because it enhances their reputation as a means to rank or profit. So if the truth does not enhance their reputation, they do not love it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 35</h4><p>35. A person who does not refrain from evils as being sins may indeed love truths, but he loves them, not because they are true, but because they serve his reputation, from which he has honor and material gain. Therefore, if they are not of service, he does not love them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 35 </h4>
<p>35. A man who does not shun evils as sins, may indeed love truths. He does not, however, love them because they are truths, but because they promote his reputation, which to him is a source of honour or gain; and therefore, if they do not serve this end, he does not love them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 35</h4><p>35. It is indeed possible for a man to love truths who does not shun evils as sins; yet he does not love them because they are truths, but because they minister to his reputation, and thereby to his honors or gains, so that if they do not minister to it he loves them not. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 35 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>35. Potest quidem homo, qui non fugit mala ut peccata, amare vera; sed non amat illa quia vera sunt, sed quia inserviunt famae, ex qua ei honor aut lucrum; quare si non inserviunt, non amat illa. </p>
