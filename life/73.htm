<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》 第73节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life73.主在圣言的许多地方教导了爱之良善。祂在马太福音中说到与邻舍和好时就教导了爱之良善：</p>
<p>你在祭坛上献礼物的时候，若想起弟兄向你怀怨，就把礼物留在坛前，先去同弟兄和好，然后来献礼物。你同告你的对头还在路上，就赶紧与他和解，恐怕他把你送给审判官，审判官交付衙役，你就下在监里了。我实在告诉你：若有最后一文钱没有还清，你断不能从那里出来。（马太福音5:23-26）</p>
<p>“同弟兄和好”是指避开敌意、仇恨和报复；显然，这就是避它们如罪。主在马太福音中还教导：</p>
<p>无论何事，你们愿意人怎样待你们，你们也要怎样待人，因为这就是律法和先知。（马太福音7:12）</p>
<p>因此，我们不可作恶。祂在其它许多地方教导了这一点。主也教导：无缘无故向弟兄动怒，视他为仇敌（马太福音5:21-22），也是杀人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 73</h4><p>73. The Lord teaches good and loving actions in many passages in the Word. He teaches such actions in Matthew when he instructs us to be reconciled with our neighbor:<p>If you bring your gift to the altar and in doing so remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First be reconciled with your brother or sister, and then come and offer your gift. And be kind and generous to your adversary when you are both on the way [to court], to keep your adversary from turning you over to a judge, keep the judge from turning you over to an officer, and keep you from being thrown in prison. I tell you in truth, you will not be released until you have paid the last penny. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_23.htm">Matthew 5:23-26</a>)<p>Being reconciled with our brother or sister is turning our backs on hostility, hatred, and vengefulness. We can see that this is turning our backs on these evils because they are sins.<p>The Lord also tells us in Matthew,<p>Whatever you want people to do for you, you do the same for them. This is the Law and the Prophets. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>)<p>[We should do] nothing evil, then; and [this is said] quite often elsewhere. Then too, the Lord tells us that killing is also being angry with our sister or brother or neighbor for no good reason and harboring hatred against them (see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 73</h4><p>73. The Lord teaches the goodness of love in many places in the Word, and He teaches it by teaching reconciliation with the neighbor in Matthew:<p>...if you go to offer your gift upon the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Deal kindly with your adversary..., while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. Assuredly I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_23.htm">Matthew 5:23-26</a>) To be reconciled to one’s brother is to refrain from enmity, hatred and revenge. Clearly it is to refrain from them as being sins.<p>The Lord also teaches in Matthew:<p>...whatever you want people to do to you, do you also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>) Thus do no evil. And this many other times.<p>The Lord teaches as well that to be angry with one’s brother or neighbor without good cause and to regard him as an enemy is also to commit murder (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 73 </h4>
<p>73. The Lord teaches the good of love in many passages in the Word; and He teaches it by enjoining reconciliation with the neighbour in Matthew:
<p>If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee;
<p>Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
<p>Agree with thine adversary ... whiles thou art in the way with him; lest ... the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
<p>Verily I say unto you, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_23.htm">Matthew 5:23-26</a>.
<p>To be reconciled to a brother is to shun enmity, hatred and revenge; and it is clear that it is to shun it as a sin. The Lord also teaches in Matthew:
<p>All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the Law and the Prophets. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>.
<p>Thus, you should not do evil. He teaches this frequently in other places. The Lord also teaches that to kill means to be angry with a brother or a neighbour without a cause, and to account him an enemy. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 73</h4><p>73. The Lord teaches the good of love in many places in the Word. He teaches it in Matthew by what He says about reconciliation with the neighbor:<p>If thou art offering thy gift upon the altar, and there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. Be well-minded to thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him; lest the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt not come out thence, till thou hast paid the last farthing (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_23.htm">Matthew 5:23-26</a>).<p>To be "reconciled to one's brother" is to shun enmity, hatred, and revenge; that it is to shun them as sin is evident. The Lord also teaches in Matthew:<p>All thing whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>);<p>Thus that we should not do evil. He teaches the same in many other places. The Lord also teaches that to be angry with one's brother or the neighbor rashly, and to hold him as an enemy, is also to commit murder (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 73 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>73. Dominus docet bonum amoris in Verbo multis in locis; et docet illud per reconciliationem cum proximo, apud Matthaeum, <p>"Si... Obtuleris munus tuum super altare, et apud hoc recordatus fueris quod frater tuus habeat aliquid contra te: relinque ibi munus... coram altari, et abi prius reconciliare fratri, et tunc veniens offer munus tuum. Et benevolentiam ini cum adversario tuo, dum es in via cum illo, ne... te tradat adversarius judici, et judex tradat te ministro, et in carcerem conjiciaris: amen dico tibi, non exibis, donec persolveris ultimum dodrantem" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_73/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_5_23-26">5:23-26</a>): <p>"reconciliari fratri" est fugere inimicitiam, odium et vindictam; quod sit fugere illud ut peccatum, patet. Docet etiam Dominus apud Matthaeum, <p>"Omnia... quaecunque volueritis ut faciant vobis homines, sic et vos facite illis: haec... est Lex et Prophetae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_73/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_7_12">7:12</a>); <p>Ita non malum: et pluries alibi. Dominus quoque docet quod "occidere" etiam sit irasci fratri seu proximo temere, et illum inimicum habere (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_73/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_5_21-22">Matthaeus 5:21-22</a>). </p>
