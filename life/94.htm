<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life94.凡相信地狱和天堂真实存在，天堂是永恒的幸福，地狱是永恒的痛苦，作恶者下地狱，行善者上天堂的人都在进行这场战斗。如此争战的人从里面或内在自我行动，并反对构成恶根的欲望，因为人若与某事争战，就不意愿它，渴望就是意愿。由此可见，只有通过争战才能挖出恶根。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 94</h4><p>94. Everyone undertakes this battle who believes that heaven and hell are real and that heaven is eternal happiness and hell eternal misery, and who believes that we come into hell if we do evil and into heaven if we do good. Whenever we do battle in this way, we are acting from our inner selves and against the compulsions that constitute the root of evil, because when we are fighting against something we are not intending it, and compulsions are intentions.<p>We can see from this that the only way to dig out the root of evil is by doing battle against it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 94</h4><p>94. Everyone engages in this struggle who believes in the existence of heaven and hell, and that heaven is a state of eternal happiness, while hell is a state of eternal unhappiness, and who believes that people who do evil go to hell, while people who do good go to heaven. Moreover, everyone who engages in this struggle is impelled from within, against his inherent urges which constitute the root of the evil. For anyone who battles against something does not will it, and to feel an urge is to will.<p>It is apparent from this that the root of evil is not removed except by a struggle. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 94 </h4>
<p>94. Every one engages in combat who believes that there is a hell and a heaven, and that heaven is eternal happiness and hell eternal unhappiness; and who believes further that those who do evil go to hell, and those who do good go to heaven. Moreover, he who engages in combat acts from an interior principle and in opposition to that lust which constitutes the root of evil; for he who fights against anything does not will it, and to lust is to will. Hence it is evident that the root of evil is only removed by combat. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 94</h4><p>94. Everyone does this battling who believes in the existence of hell and of heaven: that heaven is eternal happiness, and hell eternal unhappiness; and that those who do evils go to hell, and those who do goods to heaven. And one who thus fights acts from within, and against the concupiscence itself which constitutes the root of the evil, for one who fights against anything does not will it, and to desire is to will. This shows that the root of evil is not removed except by means of combat. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 94 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>94. Omnis qui credit quod infernum et caelum sint, et quod caelum sit felicitas aeterna, ac quod infernum sit infelicitas aeterna, et qui credit quod in infernum veniant qui mala faciunt, et in caelum qui bona faciunt, is pugnat; et qui pugnat, ille ex interiori agit, et contra ipsam concupiscentiam, quae facit radicem mali; nam qui pugnat contra aliquid, is non vult illud, et concupiscere est velle. Inde patet, quod radix mali non amoveatur quam per pugnam. </p>
