<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life105.由于人里面有来自主的这种回应和返回的能力，因而有这种相互合作的官能，所以人必须对自己的行为做个交代，并照它们受报应。因为主说：</p>
<p>人子要来临，照各人的行为报应各人。（马太福音16:27）</p>
<p>并且要出来：行善的，复活得生命；作恶的，复活受审判。（约翰福音5:29）</p>
<p>他们所作的工也随着他们。（启示录14:13）</p>
<p>他们都照各人所行的受审判。（启示录20:13）</p>
<p>看哪，我必快来！赏赐在我，要照各人所行的报应他。（启示录22:12）</p>
<p>如果人里面没有这种回应的能力，就可能有这种归责。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 105</h4><p>105. Since the Lord gives us this ability to respond in turn - and therefore a mutual relationship [with him] - we must therefore give an account of our deeds and be recompensed accordingly, for the Lord says:<p>The Son of Humanity is going to come, and he will repay all people according to their deeds. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>)<p>Those who have done what is good will go forth into the resurrection of life, and those who have done what is evil will go forth into the resurrection of condemnation. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>)<p>Their works follow them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>)<p>All were judged according to their works. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_13.htm">Revelation 20:13</a>)<p>Behold, I am coming, and my reward is with me, to give to all according to what they have done. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>)<p>If we had no ability to respond, we could not be held accountable. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 105</h4><p>105. Since this reciprocity and reciprocation, and so mutuality, is something the person has from the Lord, therefore a person must render an account of his works and be rewarded in accordance with them. For the Lord says:<p>...the Son of man will come...reward each according to his works. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>)<p>...they shall come forth — those who have done good into the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil into the resurrection of judgment. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>)<p>...their works follow them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>)<p>They were (all) judged...according to (their) works. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_13.htm">Revelation 20:13</a>)<p>Behold, I am coming..., and My reward is with Me, to give to every one according to his work. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>) If a person had no reciprocity in him, there would be no imputation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 105 </h4>
<p>105. Since there is with man from the Lord this power to reciprocate, and the converse, and since there is this consequent faculty of mutual cooperation, therefore man is to render an account of his works, and to be recompensed according to them; for the Lord says:
<p>The Son of Man shall come ... and reward every man according to his works. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>.
<p>They shall come forth that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>.
<p>Their works do follow them. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>.
<p>They were judged every man according to their works. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_13.htm">Revelation 20:13</a>.
<p>Behold I come ... and my reward is with me, to give every man according to his work. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>.
<p>If there were not with man the power to reciprocate, there could be no imputation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 105</h4><p>105. As there is in man, from the Lord, this ability to reciprocate and return, and consequently this mutuality, a man must render an account of his works, and will be requited according to them. For the Lord says:<p>The Son of man shall come, and shall render to every man according to his deeds (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>).<p>They shall come forth: they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evils unto the resurrection of judgment (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>).<p>Their works do follow with them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>).<p>They were judged every man according to his works (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_13.htm">Revelation 20:13</a>).<p>Behold, I come, and My reward is with Me, to give every man according to his work (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>).<p>If there were in man no reciprocality, there would be no imputation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 105 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>105. Quoniam illud reciprocum et vicissim, et inde mutuum, est apud hominem a Domino, ideo homo reddet rationem operum suorum, et illi retribuetur secundum illa; nam dicit Dominus, <p>"Venturus... est Filius hominis,... et reddet unicuique secundum facta ejus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_105/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_16_27">Matthaeus 16:27</a>). <p>"Exibunt qui bona fecerunt in resurrectionem vitae, et qui mala fecerunt in resurrectionem judicii" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_105/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_5_29">Johannes 5:29</a>). <p>"Opera illorum sequuntur cum illis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_105/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_14_13">Apocalypsis 14:13</a>). <p>"Judicati sunt omnes secundum opera illorum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_105/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_13">Apocalypsis 20:13</a>). <p>"Ecce venio..., et merces mea Mecum, ut dem unicuique secundum ejus opus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_105/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_22_12">Apocalypsis 22:12</a>). <p>Si reciprocum non foret apud hominem, nulla imputatio esset. </p>
