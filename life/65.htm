<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》 第65节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life65.全世界凡有某种宗教的民族都拥有类似十诫这样的戒律，凡出于宗教照这些戒律生活的人都会得救，凡不出于宗教照之生活的人都会受到诅咒。当那些出于宗教照戒律生活的人死后被天使教导时，他们就会接受真理，承认主。这是因为他们避恶如罪，因而处于良善；良善热爱真理，并出于这爱的渴望而接受真理，如前所示（32-41节）。这就是主对犹太人所说这些话的意思：</p>
<p>神的国必从你们夺去。赐给那能结果子的民族。（马太福音21:43）</p>
<p>还有这些话的意思：</p>
<p>葡萄园的主人来的时候，要除灭那些恶人，将葡萄园另租给那按果子的节候交果子的园户。（马太福音21:40-41）</p>
<p>我又告诉你们：从东从西，从北从南，将有许多人来，在神国里坐席，惟有本国的子民，竟被赶到外边黑暗里去。（马太福音8:11-12；路加福音13:29）</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 65</h4><p>65. Every society on the face of the whole earth that has any religion has laws like the Ten Commandments, and all the individuals who live by them as a matter of religion are saved, while all who do not live by them as a matter of religion are damned. After death, the ones who have lived by them as a matter of religion are taught by angels, accept truths, and acknowledge the Lord. This is because they have turned their backs on evils because they are sins and have therefore been devoted to doing what is good, and their resulting goodness loves truth and eagerly drinks it in (see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_43.htm">Matthew 21:43</a>)<p>And also these words:<p>When the lord of the vineyard comes, he will destroy those evil people and lease his vineyard to other farmers who will give him its fruits in their season. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_40.htm">Matthew 21:40-41</a>)<p>And these:<p>I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and will sit down in the kingdom of God, but the children of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_11.htm">Matthew 8:11-12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_29.htm">Luke 13:29</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 65</h4><p>65. All nations with any religion the world over possess precepts similar to those in the Ten Commandments. And all those who live those precepts in conformity with their religion are saved. But all who do not live them in conformity with their religion are condemned.<p>Those who live those precepts in conformity with their religion are instructed after death by angels, and they accept truths and acknowledge the Lord. That is because they refrain from evils as being sins and so are prompted by goodness, and goodness loves truth, and in accordance with the love’s desire accepts it, as we showed in nos. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_43.htm">Matthew 21:43</a>) Also by this:<p>...when the lord of the vineyard comes..., he will destroy those wicked men..., and lease his vineyard to other farmers who will render to him the fruits in their season. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_40.htm">Matthew 21:40-41</a>) And by this:<p>I say to you that many will come from east and west, (and from the north and the south, ) and sit down...in the kingdom of (God). But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_11.htm">Matthew 8:11-12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_29.htm">Luke 13:29</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 65 </h4>
<p>65. Among all nations throughout the world with whom there is religion, there are precepts similar to those in the Decalogue; and all who live according to them from religion are saved while all those who do not live according to them from religion are damned. Those who live according to them from religion, being instructed after death by angels, receive truths and acknowledge the Lord. The reason is, that they shun evils as sins, and hence are in good; and good loves truth, and from the desire of love receives it. This is meant by the Lord's words to the Jews:
<p>The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_43.htm">Matthew 21:43</a>.
<p>And also by these words:
<p>When the Lord of the vineyard cometh ... He will ... destroy the wicked ones, and will let out His vineyard unto other husbandmen who shall return Him the fruits in their time. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_40.htm">Matthew 21:40-41</a>.
<p>And by these:
<p>I say unto you that many shall come from the east and the west ... and from the north and the south ... and shall recline in the kingdom of God; but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_11.htm">Matthew 8:11-12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_29.htm">Luke 13:29</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 65</h4><p>65. All nations in the wide world who have religion possess precepts like those in the Decalogue, and all who from religion live them are saved, and all who do not live them from religion are damned. When those who live them from religion are instructed after death by the angels, they receive truths, and acknowledge the Lord; the reason of which is that they shun evils as sins, and are consequently in good, and good loves truth, and from the desire of this love, receives it (as has been shown above, n. 32-41). This is meant by the words of the Lord to the Jews:<p>The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_43.htm">Matthew 21:43</a>).<p>And also by these:<p>When therefore the Lord of the vineyard shall come, He will destroy those evil men, and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their season (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_40.htm">Matthew 21:40-41</a>).<p>And by these:<p>I say unto you that many shall come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God, but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_11.htm">Matthew 8:11-12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_29.htm">Luke 13:29</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 65 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>65. Apud omnes gentes in universo terrarum orbe, apud quas est religio, sunt similia praecepta, quae in Decalogo; et omnes illi qui vivunt illa ex religione, salvantur; at omnes qui non vivunt illa ex religione, damnantur. Illi qui vivunt illa ex religione, post mortem instructi per angelos recipiunt vera, et agnoscunt Dominum. Causa est, quia fugiunt mala ut peccata, et inde in bono sunt; et bonum amat verum, et ex desiderio amoris recipit illud, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_65/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_3241">Arcana Coelestia 3241</a>) ostensum est.
