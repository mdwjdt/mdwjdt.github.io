<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">五、任何人避恶如罪到何等程度，就在何等程度上拥有信仰并属灵</h4><p>Life42.信仰与生活彼此有别，就像思维与行动彼此有别一样；由于思维与理解力有关，行动与意愿有关，所以可推知，信仰与生活彼此有别，就像理解力与意愿彼此有别一样。人若知道后两者之间的区别，就知道前两者之间的区别；人若知道后两者之间的结合，就知道前两者之间的结合。因此，有必要先说一说理解力与意愿。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 42</h4><p>42. To the Extent That We Turn Our Backs on Evils Because They Are Sins, We Have Faith and Are Spiritual<p>OUR faith and our life are distinct from each other in the same way that our thought and our actions are distinct. Since our thinking comes from our understanding and our actions come from our will, it follows that our faith and our life are also distinct from each other in the same way that our understanding and our will are distinct. And therefore someone who knows how our understanding and our will are distinct also knows how our faith and our life are distinct; and someone who knows how our understanding and our will become one also knows how our faith and our life become one. That is why I need to start with something about understanding and will. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 42</h4><p>42. Insofar as Someone Refrains from Evils as Being Sins, So Far He Has Faith and Is Spiritual<p>Faith and life are two distinct things, like thinking and acting; and because thinking is a function of the intellect, and acting a function of the will, it follows that faith and life are two distinct things, like intellect and will. Someone who knows the distinction between intellect and will also knows the distinction between faith and life. And someone who knows how the intellect and the will go together also knows how faith and life go together. Therefore we must first say something about the intellect and the will. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 42 </h4>
<p>42. V. SO FAR AS ANY ONE SHUNS EVILS AS SINS, SO FAR HE HAS FAITH, AND IS SPIRITUAL
<p>Faith and life are distinct from each other, like thinking and doing; and as thinking has relation to the understanding and doing to the will, it follows that faith and life are distinct from each other, like the understanding and the will. He who knows the distinction between the latter, also knows the distinction between the former; and he who knows the conjunction of the latter, also knows the conjunction of the former. Therefore something must be premised concerning the understanding and the will. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 42</h4><p>42. IN PROPORTION AS ANY ONE SHUNS EVILS AS SINS, IN THE SAME PROPORTION HE HAS FAITH, AND IS SPIRITUAL.<p>Faith and life are distinct from each other in the same way as are thinking and doing; and as thinking is of the understanding and doing is of the will, it follows that faith and life are distinct from each other in the same way as are the understanding and the will. He who knows the distinction between the two latter knows that between the two former; and he who knows the conjunction of the two latter knows that of the two former. For this reason something shall first be set forth about the understanding and the will. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 42 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>42. (V.) QUOD QUANTUM QUIS FUGIT MALA UT PECCATA, TANTUM FIDEM HABEAT, ET SPIRITUALIS SIT. <p>Fides et vita inter se distinctae sunt, sicut cogitare et facere; et quia cogitare est intellectus, et facere est voluntatis, sequitur quod fides et vita inter se distinctae sint sicut intellectus et voluntas: qui scit distinctionem harum, ille etiam scit distinctionem illorum; et qui scit conjunctionem harum, ille etiam scit conjunctionem illorum. Quare praemittendum est aliquid de intellectu et voluntate. </p>
