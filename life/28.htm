<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》 第28节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life28.圣言在许多地方教导了目前所说的这一切；但仅从中引用下列经文。圣言教导：没有人能处于良善，同时又处于邪恶；或也可说，就灵魂而言，没有人能在天堂，同时又在地狱。以下经文教导了这一点：</p>
<p>一个人不能事奉两个主。不是恶这个爱那个，就是依附这个轻视那个。你们不能又事奉神，又事奉玛门。（马太福音6:24）</p>
<p>你们既是恶人，怎能说出好话来呢？因为心里所充满的，口里就说出来。善人从心里所存的善，就发出善来；恶人从所存的恶，就发出恶来。（马太福音12:34-35）</p>
<p>没有好树结坏果子，也没有坏树结好果子。每一棵树，凭它的果子就可认出来；人从荆棘上收不到无花果，从蒺藜上也收不到葡萄。（路加福音6:43-44）</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 28</h4><p>28. Everything said so far can be found in many places in the Word. I may cite only the following few.<p>The Word tells us that no one can be focused on doing good and doing evil at the same time, or - which amounts to the same thing - with respect to our souls we cannot be in heaven and in hell at the same time. It tells us this by saying,<p>No one can serve two masters; for you will either hate the one and love the other or hold to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and Mammon. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>)<p>How can the things you say be good when you are evil? Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. Good people out of the good treasure of their hearts bring forth good things, and evil people out of the evil treasure bring forth evil things. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_34.htm">Matthew 12:34-35</a>)<p>A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit. Every tree is known by its own fruit. People do not gather figs from thorns or harvest grapes from a bramble bush. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_43.htm">Luke 6:43-44</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 28</h4><p>28. Everything we have said so far is taught by the Word in many places, of which we will cite only the following.<p>The Word teaches that no one can be governed by good and at the same time by evil, or in other words, that no one can be with his soul in heaven and at the same time in hell. It teaches this in the following passages:<p>No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>)<p>How can you speak good things when you are evil? ...out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_34.htm">Matthew 12:34-35</a>)<p>...a good tree does not bear bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. ...every tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_43.htm">Luke 6:43-44</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 28 </h4>
<p>28. All that has been said so far is taught in the Word in many places; but only the following passages will be adduced. The Word teaches that no one can be in good and at the same time in evil; or what is the same thing, that no one as to his soul can be in heaven and at the same time in hell. It teaches this in the following passages:
<p>No man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one, and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>.
<p>How can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good man, out of the good treasure of the heart,
<p>Bringeth forth good things: and an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil things. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_34.htm">Matthew 12:34-35</a>.
<p>A good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_43.htm">Luke 6:43-44</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 28</h4><p>28. All that has been said thus far is taught by the Word in many places, of which only the following shall be presented. The Word teaches that no one can be in good and at the same time in evil, or what is the same, that no one can be (in respect to his soul) in heaven and at the same time in hell. This is taught in the following passages:<p>No man can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_6_24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).<p>How can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things, and the evil man out of its evil treasure bringeth forth evil things (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_34.htm">Matthew 12:34-35</a>).<p>A good tree produceth not evil fruit, nor doth an evil tree produce good fruit. Every tree is known by its own fruit; for of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_43.htm">Luke 6:43-44</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 28 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>28. Haec omnia, quae hactenus dicta sunt, Verbum multis in locis docet; ex quibus sequentia modo adducentur. Verbum docet quod nemo possit in bono esse et simul in malo; seu quod idem, quod nemo possit quoad animam in caelo esse et simul in inferno. Docet hoc in his:- <p>"Nemo potest duobus dominis servire; nam aut unum odio habebit et alterum amabit, aut uni adhaerebit et alterum contemnet: non potestis Deo servire et mammonae" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_28/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_6_24">Matthaeus 6:24</a>). <p>"Quomodo potestis bona loqui, cum mali estis?... ex abundantia cordis os loquitur; bonus homo ex bono thesauro cordis sui emittit bona, et malus homo ex malo thesauro emittit mala" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_28/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_12_34-35">Matthaeus 12:34-35</a>), <p>"Arbor... bona non facit fructum malum, neque arbor mala facit fructum bonum: omnis... arbor ex proprio fructu cognoscitur; non enim ex spinis colligunt ficus, neque ex rubo vindemiant uvam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_28/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_6_43-44">Lucas 6:43-44</a>). </p>
