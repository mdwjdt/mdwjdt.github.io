<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">七、各种杀人、奸淫、偷盗、作假见证，以及对这些事的贪恋，就是必须避之如罪的邪恶</h4><p>Life62.众所周知，西乃山的律法写在两块石版上；第一块石版包含与神有关的事，另一块包含与人有关的事。第一块石版包含与神有关的一切事，另一块包含与人有关的一切事，这一点在字面上并未显明；然而，这一切都包含在它们里面，它们因此被称为“十句话”，以此表示总体上的一切真理（参看61节）。不过，三言两语无法阐明一切事物以哪种方式在它们里面，但通过《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（67节）所介绍的内容可以理解这一点，读者可参考这本书。这就是为何我们说“各种杀人、奸淫、偷盗、作假见证”。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 62</h4><p>62. All Kinds of Murder, Adultery, Theft, and False Witness, Together with Urges toward Them, Are Evils on Which We Must Turn Our Backs Because They Are Sins<p>IT is common knowledge that the law of Sinai was written on two tablets and that the first tablet contains matters concerning God and the second, matters concerning us. It is not obvious in the literal text that the first tablet contains everything to do with God and that the second contains everything to do with us, but it is all in there. It is actually why they are called "the ten words, " meaning all truths in summary (see <a href="../life/61.htm">61</a> just above). However, there is no way to explain briefly how everything is there, though it can be grasped by reference to what is presented in <a href="../ss/67.htm">67</a> of Teachings on Sacred Scripture, which the reader may consult.<p>This is the reason for mentioning "all kinds of murder, adultery, theft, and false witness." </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 62</h4><p>62. Every Form of Murder, Adultery, Theft, or False Witness, Including Every Urge to Commit Them, Is an Evil Which Must Be Refrained from as Being a Sin<p>People know that the law at Sinai was written on two tablets, and that the first tablet contains laws having to do with God, and the second laws having to do with man.<p>That the first tablet contains everything having to do with God, and the second everything having to do with man, is not something apparent in the letter. But everything is present in them. That is why the commandments are called the Ten Commandments, which symbolizes all truths in their entirety (see no. <a href="../life/61.htm">61</a> just above). But in what way those truths are all present there cannot be explained in a few words. However, it may be comprehended from what we presented in <a href="../ss/67.htm">The Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture 67</a>, to which the reader is referred.<p>That is why we say, “every form of murder, adultery, theft, and false witness.” </p>

<p>62. VII. ALL KINDS OF MURDER, ADULTERY, THEFT, AND FALSE WITNESS, WITH THEIR LUST, ARE EVILS WHICH OUGHT TO BE SHUNNED AS SINS
<p>It is well known that the Law of Sinai was written upon two tables, and that the first table contains those things which relate to God and the other, those things which relate to man. That the first table contains all things relating to God, and the other, all things relating to man, does not appear in the Letter. Nevertheless all things are in them; and therefore they are also called the Ten Words, by which are signified all truths in epitome, as may be seen just above, No. <a href="61.htm">61</a>. But how all things are therein cannot be explained in a few words. It may, however, be comprehended from what was adduced in <a href="../ss/67.htm">DOCTRINE CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 67</a>, which should be referred to. Hence it is said, all kinds of murder, adultery, theft, and false witness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 62</h4><p>62. MURDERS, ADULTERIES, THEFTS, FALSE WITNESS, TOGETHER WITH ALL CONCUPISCENCE FOR THESE THINGS, ARE THE EVILS WHICH MUST BE SHUNNED AS SINS.<p>It is well known that the Law of Sinai was written on two tables, and that the first table contains the things of God, and the other the things of man. That the first table contains all things that belong to God, and the second all that belong to man, does not appear in the letter, yet are they all in them, and it is for this reason that they are called the Ten Words, by which are signified all truths in the complex (as may be seen just above, n. 61). But in what way all things are in them cannot be set forth in a few words, but may be apprehended from what has been presented in the <a href="../ss/67.htm">DOCTRINE CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 67</a>, which see. This is why it is said "murders, adulteries, thefts, and false witness of every kind." </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 62 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>62. (VII.) QUOD OMNIS GENERIS HOMICIDIA, ADULTERIA, FURTA, FALSA TESTIMONIA, CUM CONCUPISCENTIA AD ILLA, SINT MALA, QUAE UT PECCATA FUGIENDA SUNT. <p>Notum est quod Lex Sinai inscripta fuerit binis tabulis, et quod prima tabula contineat illa quae Dei sunt, et altera quae hominis. Quod prima tabula contineat omnia quae Dei sunt, et altera omnia quae hominis, non apparet in littera; sed omnia in illis sunt; quare etiam vocantur "Decem Verba," per quae significantur omnia vera in complexu (videatur mox supra,<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_62/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_61">61</a>): sed quomodo omnia inibi sunt, non paucis potest exponi; at potest comprehendi ex illis quae in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_62/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_67">Doctrina de Scriptura Sacra 67</a> allata sunt, quae videantur. Inde est, quod, dicatur omnis generis homicidia, adulteria, furta, et falsa testimonia. </p>
