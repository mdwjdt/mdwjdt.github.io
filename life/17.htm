<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life17.主在约翰福音中教导，没有人能从自己行任何真正为良善的良善：</p>
<p>若不是从天上赐给他的，人就不能得什么。（约翰福音3:27）</p>
<p>住在我里面的，我也住在他里面，这人就多结果子。因为离了我，你们就不能做什么。（约翰福音15:5）</p>
<p>“住在我里面的，我也住在他里面，这人就多结果子”表示一切良善皆来自主；“果子”表示良善；“离了我，你们就不能做什么”表示没有人能从自己做任何事。那些信主并从祂行善的人被称为光明之子（约翰福音12:36；路加福音16:8）；陪伴之人或婚礼之子（马可福音2:19）；复活之子（路加福音20:36）；神的儿子（路加福音20:36；约翰福音1:12）；从神生的（约翰福音1:13）。经上说，他们必看见神（马太福音5:8）；主要在他那里作祂的住所（约翰福音14:23）；他们有对神的信（马可福音11:22）；他们所行的是从神而行（约翰福音3:21）。这些话被概括在下面这些话中：</p>
<p>凡接待祂的，就是信祂名的人，祂就赐他们权柄，作神的儿子。这等人不是从血生的，不是从肉欲生的，也不是从人意生的，乃是从神生的。（约翰福音1:12-13）</p>
<p>“信神儿子的名”是指相信圣言并照之生活；“肉欲”是指人自己的意愿，这意愿本身是邪恶；“人意”是指人自己的理解力，这理解力本身是由邪恶所生的虚假；从这些“生的”是指那些从自己的自我意愿和行动，以及思考和说话的人；“从神生的”是指那些从主意愿和行动，以及思考和说话的人。简言之：来自人的不是良善；来自主的是良善。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 17</h4><p>17. The Lord tells us in John that no one can do anything that is genuinely good on his or her own:<p>People cannot receive anything unless it has been given to them from heaven. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>)<p>And again,<p>Those who abide in me and in whom I abide bear much fruit, because without me you cannot do anything. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>)<p>"Those who abide in me and in whom I abide bear much fruit" means that everything good comes from the Lord-"fruit" meaning what is good. "Without me you cannot do anything" means that none of us can do good on our own.<p>People who believe in the Lord and who do what is good from him are called "children of the light" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_8.htm">Luke 16:8</a>), "children of the wedding" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_19.htm">Mark 2:19</a>), "children of the resurrection" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_36.htm">Luke 20:36</a>), "children of God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_36.htm">Luke 20:36</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>), and those "born of God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_13.htm">John 1:13</a>). It says that "they will see God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>), that "the Lord will make a home with them" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm">John 14:23</a>), that they "have the faith of God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_22.htm">Mark 11:22</a>), and that "their deeds have been done in God" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_21.htm">John 3:21</a>).<p>These statements are summed up in the following words:<p>As many as received Jesus, he gave them power to become children of God and believe in his name, who were born not of blood, and not of the will of the flesh, and not of the will of a man, but of God. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>)<p>Believing in the name of the Son of God is believing the Word and living by it. The will of the flesh is our own will, which in and of itself is evil; and the will of a man is our own understanding, which in and of itself is false as a result of the evil. Those who are born of these are people who derive what they intend and act and think and speak from their own selves. Those born of God are people who derive what they intend and act and think and speak from the Lord.<p>In brief, what comes from us is not good. What comes from the Lord is good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 17</h4><p>17. That no one can do any good that is good of himself is something the Lord teaches in John:<p>A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>)<p>Also in John:<p>He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>) “He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit” means that all good comes from the Lord. Fruit means goodness. “Without Me you can do nothing” means that no one can do good of himself.<p>People who believe in the Lord and do good from Him are called “sons of light” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_8.htm">Luke 16:8</a>), “sons of the wedding” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_19.htm">Mark 2:19</a>), “sons of the resurrection” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_36.htm">Luke 20:36</a>), “sons of God” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>), and “born of God” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_13.htm">John 1:13</a>). We are told that “they shall see God” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>). That the Lord will make His abode with them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm">John 14:23</a>). That they have faith in God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_22.htm">Mark 11:22</a>). That their deeds are done from God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_21.htm">John 3:21</a>).<p>These tenets are summed up in the following words:<p>As many as received (Jesus), to them He gave the power to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>) To believe in the name of the Son of God is to believe the Word and live in accordance with it. The will of the flesh is the native character of a person’s will, which in itself is evil, and the will of man is the native character of his intellect, which in itself is falsity springing from evil. People born of these are those who will and act, and think and speak, in accord with their native self. People born of God are those who do these in obedience to the Lord.<p>In sum, good is not good that originates from man, but good is good that originates from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 17 </h4>
<p>17. That no one from himself can do any good which is good, the Lord teaches in John:
<p>A man can take (A.V. receive) nothing, except it be given him from heaven. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>
<p>And in the same:
<p>He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>.
<p>He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit, means, that all good is from the Lord. Fruit denotes good, and, Without me ye can do nothing, means, that no one can do good from himself. Those who believe on the Lord and do good from Him are called
<p>Sons (A.V. children) of light. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_8.htm">Luke 16:8</a>
<p>Sons of the bride-chamber. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_19.htm">Mark 2:19</a>
<p>Sons of the resurrection. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_36.htm">Luke 20:36</a>
<p>Sons of God. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_36.htm">Luke 20:36</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>
<p>Born of God. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_13.htm">John 1:13</a>
<p>And it is said that
<p>They shall see God. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>;
<p>The Lord will make His abode with them <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm">John 14:23</a>
<p>They have the faith of God. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_22.htm">Mark 11:22</a>
<p>Their deeds are wrought from God. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_21.htm">John 3:21</a>.
<p>These things are summed up in the words:
<p>As many as received Him [Jesus] to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name:
<p>Who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>.
<p>To believe on the name of the Son of God, is to believe the Word and live according to it; the will of the flesh is the proprium of man's will, which in itself is evil; and the will of man is the proprium of his understanding, which in itself is falsity from evil. They are "born of these" who will and act, think and speak from their proprium; while they are "born of God" who do these things from the Lord. In short, that is not good which is from man, but that is good which is from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 17</h4><p>17. That no one can from himself do any good that is really good, is taught by the Lord in John:<p>A man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>).<p>He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit; for without Me ye can do nothing (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p>"He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit," means that all good is from the Lord; "fruit" means what is good. "Without Me ye can do nothing," means that no man can from himself do anything. Those who believe in the Lord, and from Him do what is good, are called<p>Sons of light (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_8.htm">Luke 16:8</a>);<p>Sons of the bridechamber (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_19.htm">Mark 2:19</a>);<p>Sons of the resurrection (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_36.htm">Luke 20:36</a>);<p>Sons of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_36.htm">Luke 20:36</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>);<p>Born of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_13.htm">John 1:13</a>);<p>It is said that they shall see God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>);<p>That the Lord will make His abode with them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm">John 14:23</a>);<p>That they have the faith of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_11_22.htm">Mark 11:22</a>);<p>That their works are done from God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_21.htm">John 3:21</a>).<p>These things are all summed up in the following words:<p>As many as received Him, to them gave He power [potestas] to be sons of God, to them that believe in His name; who were born, not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>).<p>To "believe in the name of the Son of God," is to believe the Word and to live according to it; "the will of the flesh," is what is proper to man's will, which in itself is evil; "the will of man," is what is proper to his understanding, which in itself is falsity from evil; those "born of" these, are those who will and act, and also think and speak, from what is proper to themselves; those "born of God," are those who do all this from the Lord. In short: that which is from man is not good; but that which is good is from the Lord. </p>
