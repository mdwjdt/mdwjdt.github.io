<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life2.至于这一事实：宗教与生活有关，宗教生活就是行善，凡阅读圣言的人都会看到这一点，并在阅读的时候承认它。我们在圣言中会看到下列经文：</p>
<p>无论何人废掉这诫命中最小的一条，又教训人这样做，他在天国要称为最小的；但无论何人遵行这诫命，又教训人遵行，他在天国要称为大的。我告诉你们：你们的义若不胜于文士和法利赛人的义，断不能进天国。（马太福音5:19-20）</p>
<p>凡不结好果子的树，就砍下来丢在火里。所以，凭着他们的果子，就可以认出他们来。（马太福音7:19-20）</p>
<p>凡称呼我主啊，主啊的人，不能都进天国；惟独遵行我天父旨意的人，才能进去。（马太福音7:21）</p>
<p>当那日，必有许多人对我说，主啊，主啊，我们不是奉你的名说预言，奉你的名赶鬼，奉你的名行许多异能吗？我必向他们声明，我从来不认识你们，你们这些作恶的人，离开我去吧！（马太福音7:22-23）</p>
<p>凡听见我这话就去行的，好比一个聪明人，把房子盖在磐石上。凡听见我这话不去行的，好比一个愚拙的人，把房子盖在沙滩上。（马太福音7:24，26）</p>
<p>耶稣说，看哪，有一个撒种的出去撒种；有些种子落在硬路上，有些落在石头地上的，有些落在荆棘里的，有些落在好土里的；撒在好地上的，就是人听圣言明白了，又结出果实来，有一百倍的，有六十倍的，有三十倍的。耶稣说了这些话，就大声说，有耳可听的，就应当听！（马太福音13:3-9，23，43）</p>
<p>人子要在祂父的荣耀里，同着众使者来临。那时候，祂要照各人的行为报应各人。（马太福音16:27）</p>
<p>神的国，必从你们夺去。赐给那能结果子的民族。（马太福音21:43）</p>
<p>当人子在祂荣耀里的时候，祂要坐在祂荣耀的宝座上。祂要向那右边的绵羊说，你们这蒙我赐福的，可来承受那创世以来为你们所预备的国。因为我饿了，你们给我吃。渴了，你们给我喝。我作客旅，你们留我住。我赤身露体，你们给我穿。我病了，你们看顾我。我在监里，你们来看我。义人就回答祂说，你什么时候见我们做这些事？王要回答他们说，我实在告诉你们，这些事你们既作在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是作在我身上了。王要对左边的山羊说同样的话，因为他们没有做这些事，所以祂说，你们这被咒诅的人，离开我，进入那为魔鬼和他的使者所预备的永火里去。（马太福音25:31-41）</p>
<p>结出与悔改相称的果子来吧！现在斧子已经放在树根上，凡不结好果子的树就砍下来，丢在火里。（路加福音3:8-9）</p>
<p>耶稣说，你们为什么称呼我主啊，主啊，却不实行我所说的话呢？凡到我这里来，听见我的话就去行的，他像一个人盖房子，把根基安在磐石上；惟有听见不去行的，就像一个人在土地上盖房子，没有根基。（路加福音6:46-49）</p>
<p>耶稣说，听了神的话而遵行的人就是我的母亲，我的弟兄了。（路加福音8:21）</p>
<p>你们才站在外面叩门，说，主啊，给我们开门；祂就回答说，我不认识你们，不晓得你们是哪里来的；你们这一切作恶的人，离开我去吧。（路加福音13:25-27）</p>
<p>审判乃是这样：光来到世间，世人因自己的行为是恶的，不爱光倒爱黑暗。凡作恶的便恨光，恐怕他的行为受责备。但行真理的必来就光，要显明他所行的是在神里面而行的。（约翰福音3:19-21）</p>
<p>行善的，复活进入生命；作恶的，复活而受审判。（约翰福音5:29）</p>
<p>我们知道神不听罪人，但若有人敬拜神，又遵行祂的旨意，神就听他。（约翰福音9:31）</p>
<p>你们既知道这事，若是去行就有福了。（约翰福音13:17）</p>
<p>有了我的命令又遵守的，这人就是爱我的，我也要爱他，并且要亲自向他显现；我们要到他那里去，在他那里作我们的住所。不爱我的人就不遵守我的话。（约翰福音14:21-24）</p>
<p>耶稣说，我是真葡萄树，我父是修剪葡萄树的；凡在我里面不结果子的枝子，祂就剪去，凡结果子的，祂就修理干净，使枝子结果子更多。（约翰福音15:1-2）</p>
<p>你们多结果子，我父就因此得荣耀，你们也就是我的门徒了。（约翰福音15:8）</p>
<p>你们若遵行我所吩咐你们的，就是我的朋友了；我拣选了你们，是叫你们去结果子，并且你们的果子常存。（约翰福音15:14，16）</p>
<p>主对约翰说，你要写信给以弗所教会的天使说：我知道你的行为；但有一件事我要责备你，就是你把起初的仁爱离弃了。要悔改，行起初所行的事。不然，我就把你的灯台从原处挪去。（启示录2:1-2，4-5）</p>
<p>你要写信给士每拿教会的天使说；我知道你的行为。（启示录2:8-9）</p>
<p>你要写信给别迦摩教会的天使说：我知道你的行为，你当悔改！（启示录2:12，16）</p>
<p>你要写信给推雅推喇教会的天使说：我知道你的行为、仁爱，你末后所行的，比起初所行的更多。（启示录2:18-19）</p>
<p>你要写信给撒狄教会的天使说：我知道你的行为，按名你是活的，其实是死的。我见你的行为，在神面前并不完全；要悔改。（启示录3:1-3）</p>
<p>你要写信给非拉铁非教会的天使说：我知道你的行为。（启示录3:7-8）</p>
<p>你要写信给老底嘉教会的天使说：我知道你的行为；要悔改。（启示录3:14-15，19）</p>
<p>我听见从天上有声音对我说，你要写下，从今以后，在主里面而死的死人有福了。圣灵说，是的，他们息了自己的劳苦，他们所作的工也随着他们。（启示录14:13）</p>
<p>另有一卷展开，就是生命册，死了的人都凭着这些案卷所记载的，照他们所行的受审判，他们都照各人所行的受审判。（启示录20:12-13）</p>
<p>看哪，我必快来！赏赐在我，要照各人所行的报应他。（启示录22:12）</p>
<p>在旧约也会看到：</p>
<p>我必照他们的行为，按他们手所做的报应他们。（耶利米书25:14）</p>
<p>耶和华，你的眼睛睁开，察看世人的一切行径，为要照各人的行径和他行为的果子报应他。（耶利米书32:19）</p>
<p>我必照他们的行径察罚他们，照他们所做的报应他们。（何西阿书4:9）</p>
<p>耶和华照我们的行径作为向我们行。（撒迦利亚书1:6）</p>
<p>在许多地方，经上都说要遵行律例、诫命和律法：</p>
<p>你们要守我的律例、典章；人若遵行，就必因此活着。（利未记18:5）</p>
<p>你们要谨守我一切的律例典章，遵行它们。（利未记19:37；20:8；22:31）</p>
<p>他们遵行诫命，就被赐福，不遵行，就受到诅咒。（利未记26:4-46）</p>
<p>以色列人被吩咐在衣服边上做繸子，好叫他们能记得耶和华一切的诫命，遵行它们。（民数记15:38-39）</p>
<p>这样的经文还有一千多处。主也以比喻教导：使人成为教会一部分的，是行为，他得救取决于行为，或说他照行为得救。主的许多比喻都表明行善的被接受，作恶的被弃绝。如葡萄园的园户的比喻（马太福音21:33-44）；不结果子的无花果树的比喻（路加福音13:6-9）；给他们做生意的他连得和弥拿的比喻（马太福音25:14-31；路加福音19:13-25）；给被强盗打伤之人包扎伤口的撒玛利亚人的比喻（路加福音10:30-37）；财主和拉撒路的比喻（路加福音16:19-31）；十个童女的比喻（马太福音25:1-12）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 2</h4><p>2. As for the fact that religion is about how we live and that the [religious] way to live is to do good, everyone who reads the Word sees this and acknowledges it on reading it. We find the following in the Word:<p>Whoever breaks the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens, but whoever does and teaches [these commandments] will be called great in the kingdom of the heavens. I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of the heavens. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_19.htm">Matthew 5:19-20</a>)<p>Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire; therefore by their fruits you will know them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_19.htm">Matthew 7:19-20</a>)<p>Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of the heavens, but those who do the will of my Father who is in the heavens. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_21.htm">Matthew 7:21</a>)<p>On that day many will say to me, "Lord, Lord, haven't we prophesied in your name and done many great things in your name?" But then I will declare to them, "I do not know you. Depart from me, you workers of iniquity." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_22.htm">Matthew 7:22-23</a>)<p>Everyone who hears my words and does them I will liken to a wise man who built his house on the rock; but everyone who hears my words and does not do them will be likened to a foolish man who built his house on the sand. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_26.htm">26</a>)<p>Jesus said, "A sower went out to sow. Some seed fell on a hard-packed path, some on stony ground, some among thorns, and some into good ground. The people who received seed in good ground are those who hear and understand the Word, and as a result bear fruit and become productive, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold." When he had said these things, Jesus cried out and said, "Those who have ears to hear must hear this." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_3.htm">Matthew 13:3-9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_23.htm">23</a>)<p>The Son of Humanity is going to come in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay all people according to their deeds. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>)<p>The kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation that bears its fruits. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_43.htm">Matthew 21:43</a>)<p>When the Son of Humanity comes in his glory, then he will sit on the throne of his glory and will say to the sheep on his right, "Come, you who are blessed, and possess as your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the founding of the world; because I was hungry and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and you took me in. I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me." Then the righteous will answer him, "When did we see you like this?" But the king will answer and say, "I tell you truly, as much as you did this to one of the least of my people, you did it to me." And the king will say similar things to the goats on the left, but since they had not done things like these, he will say, "Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>)<p>Bear fruit that is consistent with repentance. The axe is already lying against the root of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_3_8.htm">Luke 3:8-9</a>)<p>Jesus said, "Why do you call me 'Lord, Lord, ' and not do what I say? Everyone who comes to me and hears what I am saying and does it is like someone building a house who laid its foundation on the rock; but anyone who hears and does nothing is like someone building a house on the ground without a foundation." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_46.htm">Luke 6:46-49</a>)<p>Jesus said, "My mother and my brothers are these who hear the Word of God and do it." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_8_21.htm">Luke 8:21</a>)<p>Then you begin to stand outside and knock on the door, saying, "Lord, open the door for us!" But he will say in reply, "I do not know where you are from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_25.htm">Luke 13:25-27</a>)<p>This is the condemnation, that light has come into the world, but people loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. All who do evil hate the light, because their deeds would be exposed; but those who do the truth come to the light so that their deeds may be clearly seen, because their deeds were done in God. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>)<p>Those who have done what is good will go forth into [the resurrection of life, but those who have done what is evil will go forth into] the resurrection of condemnation. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>)<p>We know that God does not hear sinners; but he does hear people who worship God and do his will. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_9_31.htm">John 9:31</a>)<p>If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_17.htm">John 13:17</a>)<p>The people who love me are those who have my commandments and do them; and I will love them and will manifest myself to them. I will come to them and make a home with them. Those who do not love me do not keep my words. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_15.htm">John 14:15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_21.htm">21-24</a>)<p>Jesus said, "I am the vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away; and every branch that bears fruit he prunes, so that it will bear more fruit." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_1.htm">John 15:1-2</a>)<p>My Father is glorified by your bearing much fruit and becoming my disciples. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>)<p>You are my friends if you do whatever I command you. I have chosen you so that you will bear fruit and your fruit will remain. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_14.htm">John 15:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_16.htm">16</a>)<p>The Lord said to John, "To the angel of the church of Ephesus write, 'I know your works. I have this against you, that you have left your first love. Repent and do the first works, or else I will remove your lampstand from its place.'" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_1.htm">Revelation 2:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_4.htm">4-5</a>)<p>To the angel of the church in Smyrna write, "I know your works."

(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_18.htm">Revelation 2:18-19</a>)<p>To the angel of the church in Sardis write, "I know your works, that you have a name that you are alive, but you are dead. I have not found your works perfect before God. Repent!" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_1.htm">Revelation 3:1-3</a>)<p>To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write, "I know your works." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_7.htm">Revelation 3:7-8</a>)<p>To the angel of the church in Laodicea write, "I know your works. Repent!" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_14.htm">Revelation 3:14-15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_19.htm">19</a>)<p>I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write: 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.'" "[Yes,]" says the spirit, "so that they may rest from their labors, and their works follow them." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>)<p>A book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged by the things that were written in the book; all were judged according to their works. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>)<p>Behold, I am coming quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to all according to what they have done. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>)<p>In the Old Testament, too:<p>Repay them according to their work and according to the deeds of their hands. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>)<p>Jehovah, whose eyes are open to all the ways of humankind, to give to all according to their ways and according to the fruit of their deeds ... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_32_19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>)<p>I will punish them according to their ways and repay them according to their deeds.

(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>)<p>There are also many passages where it says that we are to do the statutes, commandments, and laws, such as the following:<p>Keep my statutes and my judgments. Anyone who does so will live by means of them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_18_5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>)<p>You shall observe all my statutes and my judgments by doing them.

They were commanded to make for themselves a fringe on the hems of their garments to remind them of all the precepts of Jehovah so that they would do them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_15_38.htm">Numbers 15:38-39</a>)-and there are thousands more passages.<p>Then too, the Lord teaches in parables that works are what make us part of the church and that our salvation depends on them. Many of his parables are about those who do good being accepted and those who do evil being rejected. See, for example, the parable of the workers in the vineyard (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_33.htm">Matthew 21:33-44</a>), the parable of the fig tree that bore no fruit (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_6.htm">Luke 13:6</a> and following), the parable of the talents and the minas which those [in the parable] were to use in business (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_14.htm">Matthew 25:14-31</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_12.htm">Luke 19:12-25</a>), the parable of the Samaritan who bound up the wounds of the man beaten by robbers (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_30.htm">Luke 10:30-37</a>), the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_19.htm">Luke 16:19-31</a>), and the parable of the ten young women (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1-12</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 2</h4><p>2. That religion is a way of life, and that its life is the doing of good, is something everyone sees who reads the Word and on reading it acknowledges it.<p>We find in the Word the following declarations:<p>Whoever...breaks...the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ...I say to you, ...unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_19.htm">Matthew 5:19-20</a>)<p>Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 2 </h4>
<p>2. Every one who reads the Word perceives that religion has relation to life, and that the life of religion is to do good; and while he reads he acknowledges this. In the Word are the following passages:
<p>Whosoever ... shall break the least of these commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever doeth and teacheth them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
<p>I say unto you, except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter the kingdom of heaven. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_19.htm">Matthew 5:19-20</a>.
<p>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_19.htm">Matthew 7:19-20</a>.
<p>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_21.htm">Matthew 7:21</a>.
<p>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? ... and in thy name done many wonderful works?
<p>But then will I profess unto them, I never knew you depart from me, ye that work iniquity.... <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_22.htm">Matthew 7:22-23</a>.
<p>Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, who built his house upon a rock....
<p>But every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_26.htm">26</a>.
<p>Jesus said, A sower went forth to sow ... some seed fell on the hard way-side... some upon stony places ... some among thorns ... and some on to good ground....
<p>He that was sown on good ground is he that heareth the Word and giveth heed to it; who thereupon beareth fruit and bringeth forth, one a hundred fold, another sixty fold, and another thirty fold.
<p>When Jesus had said these words He called out, saying, Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_3.htm">Matthew 13:3-9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_23.htm">23</a>.

<p>The Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_21_43.htm">Matthew 21:43</a>.
<p>When the Son of Man shall come in His glory ... then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory ... And He shall say to the sheep on His right hand, Come, ye blessed ... inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
<p>For I was an hungered, and ye gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me to drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
<p>I was naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer Him, When saw we thee so?
<p>But the king shall answer and say unto them, Verily, I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it to me.
<p>Then shall the king speak in like manner to the goats on His left hand;
<p>And because they have not done such things, He shall say, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>.
<p>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance ... And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_3_8.htm">Luke 3:8-9</a>.
<p>Jesus said, Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? Every one that cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them ... is like a man who built a house, and laid the foundation on a rock ...
<p>But he that heareth, and doeth not is like a man, that without a foundation built an house upon the earth. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_46.htm">Luke 6:46-49</a>.
<p>Jesus said, My mother and my brethren are these who hear the Word of God, and do it. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_8_21.htm">Luke 8:21</a>.
<p>Then shall ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord open unto us; but He shall answer and say to them, I know you not whence ye are...
<p>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_25.htm">Luke 13:25</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_27.htm">27</a>.
<p>This is the judgment (A.V. condemnation), that light is come into the world, but men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
<p>For every one that doeth evil, hateth the light ... lest his deeds should be reproved.
<p>But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, since they are wrought in God. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>.
<p>And they that have done good shall come forth unto the resurrection [of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection] of judgment (A.V. damnation). <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>.
<p>We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth His will, him He heareth. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_9_31.htm">John 9:31</a>.
<p>If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_17.htm">John 13:17</a>.
<p>He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me ... and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him ...
<p>And I will come unto him, and make my abode with him.
<p>He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm">23-24</a>.
<p>Jesus said, I am the [true] vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
<p>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit He taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit He will purge it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_8.htm">John 15:8</a>.

And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you, depart from Me ye that work iniquity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_22.htm">Matthew 7:22-23</a>).<p>Everyone who heareth these words of Mine, and doeth them, shall be likened to a wise man who built his house upon the rock; and everyone that heareth these words of Mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man who built his house upon the sand (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_26.htm">26</a>).<p>Jesus said, Behold, the sower went forth to sow; some seeds fell on the hard way, others fell upon the rocky places, others fell among the thorns, and others fell into good ground; he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the Word, and attendeth to it, who thence beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.

And He shall say to the sheep on His right hand, Come ye blessed, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry, and ye gave Me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took Me in; naked, and ye clothed Me, I was sick, and ye visited Me I was in prison, and ye came unto Me. Then shall the righteous answer, When saw we Thee so? And the king shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye did it unto Me. And the king shall say the like things to the goats on the left, and because they have not done such things, He shall say, Depart from Me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31-41</a>).<p>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance even now is the axe laid unto the root of the trees every tree, therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_3_8.htm">Luke 3:8-9</a>).<p>Jesus said, Why call ye Me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? Everyone that cometh unto Me, and heareth My words, and doeth them, he is like a man building a house, and he laid a foundation upon the rock; but he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_46.htm">Luke 6:46-49</a>).<p>Jesus said, My mother and My brethren are these who hear the Word of God, and do it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_8_21.htm">Luke 8:21</a>).<p>Then shall ye begin to stand, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and He shall answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from Me, all ye workers of iniquity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_25.htm">Luke 13:25-27</a>).<p>This is the judgment: that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil; for every one that doeth evil hateth the light, lest his works should be reproved. But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>).<p>And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection [of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection] of judgment (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>).<p>We know that God heareth not sinners; but if any man be a worshiper of God, and do His will, him He heareth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_9_31.htm">John 9:31</a>).<p>If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_17.htm">John 13:17</a>).<p>He that hath My commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me and I will love him, and will manifest Myself unto him and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.
