<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life26.我被允许看见并听见许多人死后数算自己的好行为和虔诚表现，如上面所列举的那些（24-25节），以及其它许多行为。在他们当中，我也看见了一些有灯没有油的人。当调查他们有没有避恶如罪时，结果发现他们并没有。因此，他们被告知，他们是邪恶的；后来，我看见他们进入洞穴，那里住着像他们那样的其他恶人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 26</h4><p>26. I have been granted the opportunity to see and hear many people after their deaths listing their good works and their devotional practices along the lines of those just mentioned in <a href="../life/24.htm">24</a>, <a href="../life/25.htm">25</a>, plus some others as well. I also saw that some of them had lamps but no oil, and when they were asked whether they had turned their backs on evil deeds because they are sins it turned out that they had not. So they were told that they were evil, and later I saw them going into caves where there were other evil people like themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 26</h4><p>26. I have been given to see and hear many people after death who listed their good deeds and exercises of piety, the kind mentioned just mentioned in nos. <a href="../life/24.htm">24</a> and <a href="../life/25.htm">25</a> above, and more still. Among them I have also seen some who had lamps and no oil. But they were asked whether they had refrained from evils as being sins, and when they were discovered not to have done so, the people were informed therefore that they were evil. Moreover I saw them afterward go into caverns inhabited by people evil like themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 26 </h4>
<p>26. It has been granted me to see and hear many after death who recounted their good deeds and exercises of piety, such as those just mentioned above in numbers <a href="24.htm">24</a>, <a href="25.htm">25</a>, and many more. Among them I have also seen some who had lamps and no oil; but when inquiry was made whether they had shunned evils as sins, it was found that they had not. They were therefore told that they were wicked; and they were afterwards seen to enter caves where there were wicked spirits like them themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 26</h4><p>26. I have been permitted to see and hear many after death who reckoned up their good works and performances of piety, such as those mentioned above (n. <a href="../life/24.htm">24-25</a>), and many others besides. Among them I have also seen some who had lamps and no oil. Inquiry was made as to whether they had shunned evils as sins, and it was found that they had not, and therefore they were told that they were evil. Afterwards also they were seen to go into caverns where evil ones like them had their abode. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 26 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>26. Datum est videre et audire multos post mortem, qui enumeraverunt bona sua opera, et pietatis exercitia, quae nunc supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_26/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_24">24</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_26/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_25">25</a>) memorata sunt, et plura adhuc. Inter illos etiam vidi quosdam habere lampades et non oleum. At inquisitum est num fugerint mala ut peccata, ac inventi, quod non; quare illis dictum est, quod mali sint. Visi etiam postea intrare cavernas, ubi similes mali erant. </p>
