<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》 第58节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life58.在为人的第二块石版上，经上没有说人必须行这样或那样的良善，而是说他决不可行这样或那样的邪恶，如：“不可杀人，不可奸淫，不可偷盗，不可作假见证，不可贪恋”。原因在于，人无法从自己行任何良善；但当他不再作恶时，就能行善了，不是从他自己，而是从主行善。下文（101-107节）我们会看到：一个人若谦卑地祈求主的能力，就能靠这能力貌似凭自己避恶如罪。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 58</h4><p>58. In the second tablet, which is for us, it does not say that we must do some specific good thing but that we must not do some specific evil thing - for example, "You are not to kill, you are not to commit adultery, you are not to steal, you are not to bear false witness, you are not to covet." This is because we cannot do anything good on our own, but when we do not do evil things, the good things we do come not from ourselves but from the Lord.<p>We shall see in what follows [<a href="../life/101.htm">101-107</a>] that we can turn our backs on evil - seemingly on our own, but actually with the Lord's power - if we ask for this humbly. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 58</h4><p>58. In the second tablet, the one for man, we are not told that a person must do this or that good. Instead we are told that he must not do this or that evil. So we are commanded, “You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness, you shall not covet.” That is because no person can do any good of himself. But when he does not do evil, he then does good, not of himself, but from the Lord.<p>A person can, by the Lord’s power, refrain from evils as though of himself, if he implores that power, as we shall later see. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 58 </h4>
<p>58. On the other table, which is for man, it is not said that man must do this or that good but it is said that he must not do this or that evil as, Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false witness; Thou shalt not covet. The reason is, that man cannot do any good from himself; but when he does not do evils, then he does good, not from himself, but from the Lord. That man is able to shun evils as from himself, by the Lord's power, if he implores it, will be seen in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 58</h4><p>58. In the second table, which is for man, it is not said that man must do this or that good, but that he must not do this or that evil, as for example, "Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet." The reason is that man cannot do any good whatever from himself, but when he no longer does evils, then he does good, not from himself but from the Lord. That by the power of the Lord a man is able to shun evils as of himself if he begs for that power, will be seen in the following pages. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 58 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>58. In altera tabula, quae est pro homine, non dicitur quod homo faciet hoc et illud bonum; sed dicitur quod non faciet hoc et illud malum: ut, "Non occides," "Non adulteraberis," "Non furaberis," "Non false testaberis," "Non concupisces." Causa est, quia homo non aliquod bonum potest facere a se; sed cum ille mala non facit, tunc bonum facit non a se sed a Domino. Quod homo possit fugere mala sicut a se ex potentia Domini, si illam imploret, videbitur in sequentibus. </p>
