<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》 第51节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life51.目前所说的这一切可通过以下圣言中的经文来证实：</p>
<p>善人从他心里的良善库房就拿出善来，恶人从他心里的邪恶库房就拿出恶来，因为心里所充满的，口里就说出来。（路加福音6:45；马太福音12:35）</p>
<p>在圣言中，“心”表示人的意愿；由于人出于意愿思考和说话，所以经上说：心里所充满的，口里就说出来。马太福音：</p>
<p>入口的不能污秽人；从心里发出的，这才污秽人。（马太福音15:11，18）</p>
<p>此处“心”也表示意愿。耶稣论到那位用香膏抹祂脚的女人说：</p>
<p>她的罪赦免了，因为她的爱多；你的信救了你。（路加福音7:47，50）</p>
<p>由此明显可知，当罪得赦免或宽恕时，因而当它们不复存在时，信便拯救人。那些未陷入自己的意愿自我，因而未陷入自己的理解力自我，也就是说，未陷入邪恶和由此而来的虚假之人就被称为“神的儿子”，“从神的”；他们就是那些信主的人，主自己在约翰福音（1:12，13）中教导了这一点。对这段经文的解释可参看前文（17e节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 51</h4><p>51. The following passages support what has been said thus far:<p>Good people out of the good treasure of their hearts bring forth what is good; evil people out of the evil treasure of their hearts bring forth what is evil. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_35.htm">Matthew 12:35</a>)<p>In the Word, the heart means our will, and since this is the source of our thinking and speaking, it says that "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."<p>It is not what goes into the mouth that makes people unclean but what comes out of the heart; this is what makes people unclean. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_15_11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>)<p>Again, the heart means our will. And Jesus said of the woman who had washed his feet with anointing oil that her sins were forgiven because she loved greatly; and later added, "Your faith is saving you" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_7_46.htm">Luke 7:46-50</a>).<p>We can see from these words that when our sins are forgiven - that is, when they are no longer there - our faith saves us.<p>In <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12-13</a> the Lord tells us that people are called "children of God" and "born of God" when their will is not full of a sense of self-importance and their understanding is therefore not clouded by that same sense of self-importance - that is, when they are not focused on what is evil and therefore on what is false. He also teaches us there that such people are the ones who believe in the Lord. For an explanation of these verses see the end of <a href="../life/17.htm">17</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 51</h4><p>51. What we have said so far is confirmed by the following passages in the Word:<p>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good; but an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>, cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_35.htm">Matthew 12:35</a>) In the Word the heart means a person’s will. And because it prompts a person to think and speak, we are told that “out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.”<p>Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_15_11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>) The heart here, too, means the will.<p>Jesus said of the woman who washed His feet and anointed them that her sins were forgiven, because she loved much. And after that He said, “Your faith has saved you” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_7_46.htm">Luke 7:46-50</a>). This makes it apparent that faith saves when sins have been forgiven, thus when they are no more.<p>Those people are called children of God and born of God who are not governed by the inherent nature of their will, and so neither by the inherent nature of their intellect. That is, they are people who are not prompted by evil and its accompanying falsity. And they are people who believe in the Lord, as He Himself teaches in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>, a passage whose explanation may be seen at the end of no. <a href="../life/17.htm">17</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 51 </h4>
<p>51. What has been said thus far is confirmed by the following passages in the Word:
<p>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_35.htm">Matthew 12:35</a>. By heart in the Word is meant the will of man; and because from this man thinks and speaks, it is said that of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_35.htm">Matthew 12:35</a>.
<p>By heart in the Word is meant the will of man; and because from this man thinks and speaks, it is said that of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
<p>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but ... that which cometh forth from the heart, this defileth the man. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_15_18.htm">Matthew 15:18</a>.
<p>By the heart here is also meant the will.
<p>Jesus said concerning the woman who washed His feet with ointment, that her sins were remitted, for she loved much. And later He said, Thy faith hath saved thee. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_7_46.htm">Luke 7:46-50</a>.
<p>From this it is evident that when sins are remitted, that is, when they cease, faith saves. That those are called sons of God, and born of God, who are not in the proprium of their own will, and consequently not in the proprium of their own understanding, that is, who are not in evil, and falsity thence derived, and that those are they who believe on the Lord, He Himself teaches in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>. For an explanation of this passage in John see above No. <a href="17.htm">17</a>, at end. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 51</h4><p>51. All the foregoing is confirmed by the following passages in the Word:<p>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_35.htm">Matthew 12:35</a>).<p>The "heart" in the Word means man's will, and as man thinks and speaks from this, it is said: "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh."<p>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which goeth out of the heart, this defileth the man (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_15_11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_15_18.htm">18</a>).<p>The "heart" here too means the will. Jesus said of the woman who anointed His feet with ointment:<p>Her sins are forgiven for she loved much; thy faith hath saved thee (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_7_47.htm">Luke 7:47</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_7_50.htm">50</a>);<p>From which it is evident that when sins have been remitted or forgiven, thus when they exist no longer, faith saves. That those are called "sons of God" and "born of God" who are not in the Own of their will, and consequently are not in the Own of their understanding; that is to say, who are not in evil and from this in falsity; and that these are they who believe in the Lord, He Himself teaches in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>, which passage may be seen explained above in n. 17, at the end. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 51 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>51. Haec quae hactenus dicta sunt, confirmantur ex his in Verbo: <p>"Bonus homo ex bono thesauro cordis sui profert bonum; at malus homo ex malo thesauro cordis sui profert malum; nam ex abundantia cordis loquitur os" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_51/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_6_46">Lucas 6:46</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_51/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_12_35">Matthaeus 12:35</a>): <p>Per "cor" in Verbo intelligitur voluntas hominis; et quia homo inde cogitat et loquitur, dicitur "Ex abundantia cordis loquitur os." <p>"Non quod intrat in os, immundum reddit hominem; sed quod egreditur ex corde, hoc immundum reddit hominem" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_51/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_15_11">Matthaeus 15:11</a>); <p>Per "cor" etiam hic intelligitur voluntas. <p>Jesus dixit de muliere quae unguento lavit pedes Ipsius, "Remissa sunt ei peccata, quia multum amavit;" et postea, "Fides tua te salvam facit" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_51/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_7_46-50">Lucas 7:46-50</a> <sup>1</sup>); <p>Ex quibus patet quod cum peccata remissa sunt, ita cum non sunt, fides salvet. Quod "filii Dei" et "nati a Deo" dicantur, qui non in proprio voluntatis suae sunt, et inde non in proprio intellectus sui, hoc est, qui non in malo sunt et inde in falso, et quod illi sint qui credunt in Dominum, docet Ipse apud Johannem, cap. i., vers. 12, 13; qui locus explicatus videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_51/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_17">17</a> fin.)<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;vii. pro "vi." </p>
