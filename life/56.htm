<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life56.如此大的能力和如此大的神圣存在于该律法里面，是因为它包含或综合了构成宗教的一切。也就是说，它由两块石版构成：其中一块包含了与神有关的一切，一块包含了与人有关的一切。这就是为何该律法的诫命被称为“十句话”，被如此称呼，是因为“十”表示全部。下一章会看到，该律法如何包含或综合了构成宗教的一切。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 56</h4><p>56. Another reason for the power and holiness of that law is that it is a summary of everything that constitutes religion. That is, it consisted of two tablets, one briefly containing everything that has to do with God and the other everything that has to do with us. That is why the commandments of that law are called "the Ten Words"-so called because "ten" means "all."<p>How that law summarizes everything that constitutes religion, though, will be explained under the next heading [<a href="../life/64.htm">64</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 56</h4><p>56. Such great power and such great holiness resided in that law for the further reason that it embraced everything having to do with religion. For it consisted of two tablets, one of which contained everything on the part of God, and the other everything on the part of man. The precepts of that law were therefore called the Ten Commandments, called so because the number ten symbolizes everything.<p>But how that law embraces everything having to do with religion, this will be seen in the next chapter. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 56 </h4>
<p>56. Such power and holiness resided in the Law because it comprised all things of religion; for it consisted of two tables, one of which contains all things relating to God, and the other, all things relating to man. Therefore the precepts of the Law are called the Ten Words. They are so called because ten signifies all. But how the Law comprises all things of religion will be seen in a following article. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 56</h4><p>56. So great a power and so great a holiness existed in that Law for the further reason that it was a complex of all things of religion for it consisted of two tables of which the one contains all things that are on the part of God, and the other in a complex all things that are on the part of man. The commandments of this Law are therefore called the "Ten Words," and are so called because "ten" signifies all. But how this Law is a complex of all things of religion will be seen in the following chapter. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 56 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>56. Tanta potentia et tanta sanctitas inerat isti Legi, etiam quia illa erat complexus omnium religionis; constabat enim ex binis tabulis, quarum una continet omnia quae a parte Dei sunt, et altera in complexu omnia quae a parte hominis sunt. Ideo Legis illius praecepta vocantur "decem Verba;" ita vocantur quia "decem" significant omnia. Sed quomodo illa Lex est complexus omnium religionis, videbitur in sequente articulo. </p>
