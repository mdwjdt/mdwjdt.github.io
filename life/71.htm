<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life71.由于良善与邪恶是对立面，所以可推知，后者通过前者被移走。两个对立面无法共存，就像天堂与地狱无法共存一样。如果它们在一起，就会有不冷也不热的状态；论到这种状态，启示录上说：</p>
<p>我知道你也不冷也不热；我巴不得你或冷或热。你既如温水，也不冷也不热，所以我必从我口中把你吐出去。（启示录3:15-16）</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 71</h4><p>71. Since this goodness and that evil are opposites, it follows that the latter is repelled by the former. Two opposites cannot be one, as heaven and hell cannot be one. If they did, it would be like that lukewarm state described in the Book of Revelation as follows:<p>I know that you are neither cold nor hot. It would have been better if you were cold or hot; but since you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I am about to vomit you out of my mouth. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_15.htm">Revelation 3:15-16</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 71</h4><p>71. Since this goodness and that evil are opposites, it follows that the evil is removed by the goodness. Two opposites cannot exist together, even as heaven and hell cannot. If they are together, the result would be lukewarm, concerning which we are told in the book of Revelation the following:<p>I know...that you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were cold or hot. But because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, ...I will vomit you out of My mouth. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_15.htm">Revelation 3:15-16</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 71 </h4>
<p>71. Since this good and that evil are opposites, it follows that the latter is removed by the former. Two opposites cannot exist together, as heaven and hell cannot exist together. If they were together there would exist that lukewarm state concerning which it is written in the Revelation:
<p>I know ... that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.
<p>So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_15.htm">Apocalypse 3:15-16</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 71</h4><p>71. As this good and that evil are opposites, it follows that the latter is removed by means of the former. Two opposites cannot be together, even as heaven and hell cannot; if they were together there would be lukewarmness, of which it is said in Revelation:<p>I know that thou art neither cold nor hot; I would thou wert cold or hot; but because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of My mouth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_15.htm">Revelation 3:15-16</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 71 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>71. Quoniam hoc bonum et illud malum sunt opposita, sequitur quod hoc removeatur per illud; duo opposita non possunt esse una, sicut non caelum et infernum una: si una, foret tepidum, de quo ita in Apocalypsi, <p>"Novi... quod neque frigidus sis neque calidus; utinam frigidus esses aut calidus; sed quia tepidus es, neque frigidus neque calidus, exspuam te ex ore meo" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_71/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_15-16">3:15-16</a>). </p>
