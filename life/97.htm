<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 97</h4><p>97. This battle is hard only if we have given free rein to our cravings and indulged in them deliberately, or if we have stubbornly rejected the holy principles of the Word and the church. Otherwise, it is not hard. We need only resist evils in our intentions once a week or twice a month and we will notice a change. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 97</h4><p>97. This battle is not severe except in the case of people who have given full rein to their urges and have indulged in them deliberately, and in the case of people, too, who have willfully rejected the sanctities of the Word and the church.<p>But for others the battle is not severe. Let them resist evils in intention just once a week or twice a month, and they will perceive a change. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 97 </h4>
<p>97. This combat is not grievous, except for those who have relaxed all restraints upon their lusts, and who have deliberately indulged them; and also for those who have confirmed themselves in rejecting the holy things of the Word and the Church. For others, however, it is not grievous; let them resist evils in intention only once a week, or twice in a month, and they will perceive a change. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 97</h4><p>97. This combat is not severe except in the case of those who have given free rein to their concupiscences, and have indulged them of set purpose, and also in the case of those who have stubbornly cast off the holy things of the Word and of the church. With others it is not severe; let them even once in a week, or twice in a month, resist the evils they are inclined to, and they will perceive a change. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 97 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>97. Pugna illa non gravis est nisi illis, qui omnia frena concupiscentiis laxaverunt, et ex proposito illis indulserunt; et quoque illis, qui sancta Verbi et ecclesiae in obfirmatione repudiaverunt. At reliquis non gravis est; resistant malis in intentione modo semel in septimana, aut bis in mense, et percipient mutationem. </p>
