<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life55.它们是至圣的，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：耶和华自己，也就是主，于火中同众天使降临西乃山，从山上通过一种活生生的声音颁布它们，百姓预备自己三天才能看见并听见这一切；这山的四围定了界限，免得有人靠近而死，连祭司和长老都不许接近，只有摩西可以；神用手指将这些律法写在两块石版上；当摩西第二次带着这两块石版下山时，他的面皮发光；后来这两块石版被放在约柜中，约柜被安置在会幕的核心处，上面设有施恩座，施恩座两头有金子打造的基路伯；这是他们教会的至圣之物，被称为至圣所；挂在它面前的帷帐外边放有代表天堂和教会的神圣事物的事物，即：有七个金灯盏的灯台，金香坛，包金的桌子，桌子上摆有陈设饼或脸饼，还有四围用捻的细麻和紫色、染过两次的朱红色线所织的幔子。整个会幕的神圣唯独来源于约柜中的律法。</p>
<p>由于会幕因着约柜中的律法的这种神圣，整个以色列民按吩咐照各支派的顺序在会幕周围安营，并跟在约柜后面依次行进；那时，会幕上面日间有云柱，夜间有火柱。由于那律法的神圣和主在其中的同在，主才在基路伯之间的施恩座上与摩西说话，约柜被称为“耶和华在那里”。亚伦若非献祭和烧香，也不允许进到帷帐之内。正因那律法是教会的至圣，所以约柜被大卫迎入锡安；后来被存放在耶路撒冷圣殿的中间，构成它的内殿。</p>
<p>由于主在律法之内和周围的同在，神迹才会因盛有律法的约柜而行出，如：约旦河的水被分开，只要约柜停在河中央，百姓就从干地过河；抬着约柜围绕耶利哥城，城墙就倒塌；大衮，就是非利士人的神，先是在约柜前仆倒，后来躺在这庙的门槛上，没有头；伯示麦人因约柜的缘故，有数万人被击杀；更不用说其它神迹了。这些神迹的发生唯独因为主在祂话中的同在，这些话就是十诫。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 55</h4><p>55. We can tell how supremely holy they were from the fact that Jehovah himself - the Lord, that is - came down upon Mount Sinai in fire, with angels, and proclaimed them from there with his own voice, and that the people spent three days preparing themselves for seeing and hearing all this. The mountain was also fenced off so that no one would approach it and die. Not even priests or elders were allowed near; Moses alone was allowed. The laws were written on two stone tablets by the finger of God. When Moses brought the tablets down from the mountain the second time, his face shone. Later they were placed in an ark, which was set in the very heart of the tabernacle and had a mercy seat on it, with angel guardians made of gold above that. There was nothing holier in their church, and it was called "the most holy place." Outside the veil that surrounded it they brought together things that represented holy elements of heaven and the church - the lampstand with its seven golden lamps, the golden altar of incense, and the gilded table for the showbread, all surrounded by curtains of fine linen and purple and scarlet thread. The sole reason for the holiness of this whole tabernacle was the law that was in the ark.</p><p>[2] Because of the holiness of the tabernacle, which resulted from the presence of the law in the ark, the whole Israelite population camped around it, in a set arrangement tribe by tribe, and traveled behind it in a set sequence. There was also a cloud above it in the daytime then, and fire above it at night. Because of the holiness of the law and the Lord's presence in it, it was upon the mercy seat between the angel guardians that the Lord spoke to Moses, and the ark was called "Jehovah" there. In fact Aaron was not allowed to go behind the veil without sacrifices and incense.<p>Because the law was the essential holiness of the church, David brought the ark into Zion, and it was later placed at the center of the Jerusalem temple where [Solomon] had made an inner sanctuary for it.</p><p>[3] Because of the Lord's presence in and around the law, miracles were performed by means of the ark in which the law lay. For example, the waters of the Jordan were cut off, and as long as the ark rested in its midst, the people crossed over on dry ground. The walls of Jericho fell because the ark was carried around them. Dagon, the god of the Philistines, fell before the ark and later lay on the threshold of the shrine with its head broken off. Tens of thousands of the people of Beth-shemesh were struck down because of the ark, and so on. All these things happened simply because of the Lord's presence in his "Ten Words, " which are the Ten Commandments. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 55</h4><p>55. That these laws were so very holy can be seen from the fact that Jehovah Himself, that is, the Lord, descended onto Mount Sinai in fire, accompanied by angels, and promulgated them from there with His own voice; that the people readied themselves for three days to see and hear this; that bounds were set around the mountain to keep anyone from approaching and dying; that not even the priests or elders were to approach, but Moses only; that these laws were inscribed on two stone tablets with the finger of God; that when Moses brought them down from the mountain a second time, His face shone; that afterward they were placed in the Ark, and the Ark was placed in the innermost part of the Tabernacle, on which was set the mercy seat, and over it cherubim of gold; that this was the holiest focus of their church and called the most holy place; that set outside the veil within which the Ark was placed were objects that represented the sanctities of heaven and the church, namely the golden lampstand with its seven lamps, the golden altar of incense, and the table overlaid with gold which held the showbread, surrounded by curtains of linen, purple and scarlet.<p>The holiness of this whole Tabernacle was due solely to the law placed in the Ark.</p><p>[2] Because of the holiness of the Tabernacle, owing to the law in the Ark, the Israelite people were all commanded to camp about it in order by tribes, and to set out in order after it; and a cloud then stood over it by day, and fire by night.<p>Because of the holiness of that law, and the Lord’s presence in it, the Lord spoke with Moses from upon the mercy seat between the cherubim, and the Ark was called the abode of Jehovah. Aaron, moreover, was permitted to enter within the veil only with sacrifices and incense.<p>Because that law was holiness itself in the church, therefore David brought the Ark into Zion. And it was later placed in the midst of the Temple in Jerusalem and constituted its inner sanctuary.</p><p>[3] Because of the Lord’s presence in that law and surrounding it, miracles were also occasioned by the Ark which contained that law. For example, the Jordan’s waters were parted, and as long as the Ark rested in the midst of it, the people crossed over on dry ground. Its being carried around caused the walls of Jericho to fall. Dagon, the Philistine god, fell down before it, and after that lay at the threshold of the shrine with its head broken off. Moreover, because of the Ark many thousands of the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh were struck. And other miracles as well.<p>All of these events occurred solely because of the Lord’s presence in His Ten Commandments, which are the precepts of the Decalogue. </p>

<p>55. Their supreme holiness may appear from the following circumstances. Jehovah Himself, that is, the Lord, attended by angels, descended upon Mount Sinai in fire, and thence promulgated them by word of mouth. For three days the people prepared themselves to see and to hear. Bounds were set about the Mount lest any one should approach and die. Neither the priests nor the Elders drew near, but Moses only. The laws were written on two tables of stone by the finger of God. The face of Moses shone when he brought them down the second time from the Mount. The tables were afterwards deposited in the ark, and this was placed in the inmost sanctuary of the tabernacle. Over the ark was placed the mercy-seat, above which were placed the golden cherubim. This sanctuary was the most holy thing of their Church, and was called the Holy of holies. Outside the veil, within which was this Holy of holies, were placed many objects representing the holy things of heaven and the Church, as the golden lampstand with seven lamps, the golden altar of incense, the table overlaid with gold on which was the shewbread, with the curtains round about, made of fine linen, purple and scarlet. The holiness of the whole of this tabernacle was derived solely from the Law which was in the ark.
<p> </p>
<p>[2] On account of the holiness of the tabernacle, arising from the Law in the ark, all the people of Israel were commanded to encamp about it in order, according to their tribes, and to march in order after it, when a cloud was over it by day, and a fire by night. On account of the holiness of the Law, and the presence of the Lord in it, the Lord talked with Moses from over the mercy-seat between the cherubim, and the ark was called "The Presence of Jehovah." Further, Aaron was not permitted to enter within the veil, except with sacrifices and incense. Because the Law was the very holiness of the Church, therefore the ark was introduced into Zion by David; and it was afterwards placed in the midst of the temple at Jerusalem and constituted its sanctuary.
<p>On account of the presence of the Lord in and about the Law, miracles were also wrought by the ark, within which was the Law. Thus the waters of Jordan were divided, and while the ark rested in the midst of the river, the people passed over on dry ground. The walls of Jericho fell because the ark was carried round them. Dagon, the god of the Philistines, fell down before it, and afterwards lay at the threshold of his temple, with his head cut off. The Bethshemites, to the number of many thousands, were smitten on account of it; besides other miracles. All these took place solely from the presence of the Lord in His Ten Words, which are the Precepts of the Decalogue. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 55</h4><p>55. That they were most holy is evident from the fact that Jehovah Himself (that is, the Lord) came down upon Mount Sinai in fire, and with angels, and promulgated them from it by a living voice, and that the people had prepared themselves for three days to see and to hear; that the mountain was fenced about lest anyone should go near it and should die; that neither were the priests nor the elders to draw near, but Moses only; that those laws were written by the finger of God on two tables of stone; that when Moses brought the tables down from the mountain the second time, his face shone; that the tables were afterwards laid away in the ark, and the ark in the inmost of the tabernacle, and upon it was placed the mercy-seat, and upon this cherubs of gold; that this was the most holy thing of their church, being called the holy of holies; that outside the veil that hung before it there were placed things that represented holy things of heaven and the church, namely, the lampstand with its seven golden lamps, the golden altar of incense, and the table overlaid with gold on which were the loaves of faces, and surrounded with curtains of fine linen, bright-crimson, and scarlet. The holiness of this whole tabernacle had no other source than the Law that was in the ark.</p><p>[2] On account of this holiness of the tabernacle from the Law in the ark, the whole people of Israel, by command, encamped around it in the order of their tribes, and marched in order after it, and there was then a cloud over it by day, and a fire by night. On account of the holiness of that Law, and the presence of the Lord in it, the Lord spoke with Moses above the mercy-seat between the cherubs, and the ark was called "Jehovah there." Aaron also was not allowed to enter within the veil except with sacrifices and incense. Because that Law was the very holiness of the church, the ark was brought by David into Zion; and later it was kept in the midst of the temple at Jerusalem, and constituted its shrine.</p><p>[3] On account of the Lord's presence in that Law and around it, miracles were wrought by the ark in which was that Law: the waters of Jordan were cleft asunder, and so long as the ark was resting in the midst of it, the people passed over on dry ground; when the ark was carried round the walls of Jericho they fell; Dagon the god of the Philistines fell down before it, and afterwards lay on the threshold of the temple without his head; and on its account the Bethshemites were smitten to the number of many thousands not to mention other miracles. These were all performed solely by the Lord's presence in His Ten Words, which are the commandments of the decalogue. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 55 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>55. Quod sanctissimae fuerint, constare potest ex eo, quod Ipse Jehovah, hoc est, Dominus, descenderit super Monte Sinai in igne et cum angelis, et illas viva voce inde promulgaverit; et quod populus per triduum se praeparaverit ad videndum et audiendum: quod mons circumseptus fuerit, ne quis accederet et moreretur: quod nec sacerdotes neque seniores appropinquarent, sed Moses solus: quod Leges illae inscriptae fuerint binis tabulis lapideis digito Dei: quod Moses, cum illas secunda vice e monte deportavit, facie radiaverit: quod postea repositae fuerint in arca, et haec in intimo tabernaculi; et super illam datum fuerit propitiatorium, et super hoc positi cherubi, ex auro: quod hoc fuerit sanctissimum ecclesiae illorum, et vocatum sanctum sanctorum; quod extra velum, intra quod illud, collocata fuerint, quae repraesentaverunt sancta caeli et ecclesiae, quae erant candelabrum cum septem lucernis ex auro, altare suffimenti ex auro, et mensa super qua panes facierum obducta auro, cum aulaeis circumcirca ex bysso, purpura et coccino. Sanctitas totius hujus tabernaculi non aliunde fuit, quam ex Lege quae fuit in arca. Propter sanctitatem tabernaculi ex Lege in arca, universus populus Israeliticus circum illud in ordine secundum tribus ex mandato castrametatus est, et in ordine post illud profectus est; et tunc supra illud fuit nubes interdiu, et ignis noctu. Propter sanctitatem Legis illius, et praesentiam Domini in illa, loquebatur Dominus super propitiatorio inter cherubos cum Mose; et arca vocabatur "Jehovah ibi:" tum non licuit Aharoni intrare intra velum nisi cum sacrificiis et suffitu. Quia Lex illa erat ipsa sanctitas ecclesiae, ideo arca introducta fuit in Zionem a Davide; et postea in medio templi Hierosolymitani reposita, et faciebat ejus adytum. Propter Domini praesentiam in Lege illa et circum illam, etiam miracula per arcam, in qua Lex illa fuit, facta sunt: ut quod aquae Jordanis discissae sint, et quamdiu arca in medio quiescebat, populus in sicco transiverit; quod per circumlationem ejus muri Jerichuntis ceciderint; quod Dagon deus Philisthaeorum coram illa decideret, et postea ad limen fani jaceret divulsus a capite; et quod propter illam percussi sint Bethschemitae ad plura millia; praeter alia, Haec omnia ex sola praesentia Domini in decem Ipsius Verbis, quae sunt Praecepta Decalogi. </p>
