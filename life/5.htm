<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》 第5节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life5.在英国，人们在靠近圣餐礼之前所念的劝诫词如下：被视为配坐在圣桌前，或配领圣餐的方法和途径是：首先按神诫命的法则检查你的生活和言谈；无论你在哪里发觉自己要么通过意愿和话语，要么通过行为而有所冒犯，就在哪里为自己的罪哀叹，完全出于纠正生活的目的而向全能的神忏悔；你若发觉自己的冒犯不仅得罪神，还得罪邻舍，就要与他们和解，尽最大能力预备为你向别人所造成的一切伤害和错误作出恢复和赔偿，同样准备饶恕冒犯你的其他人，正如你的冒犯在神手里得到饶恕一样；否则，领受圣餐只会增加你的诅咒。因此，你们当中有谁若是亵渎神的人，是祂圣言的阻碍者或毁谤者，是奸淫者，或心怀恶意或嫉妒，或有其它任何严重罪行，就要悔改自己的罪，否则就不要来到这圣桌前；免得参加圣餐礼后，魔鬼进入你，像进入犹大一样，使你充满一切罪孽，给你的身体和灵魂都带来毁灭。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 5</h4><p>5. The way and means to be received as worthy partakers of that Holy Table [the Holy Supper] is, first, to examine your lives and conversations [dealings with others] by the rule of God's commandments, and wherever you shall perceive yourselves to have offended either by will, word, or deed, there to bewail your own sinfulness, and to confess yourselves to Almighty God, with full purpose of amendment of life; and if you shall perceive your offences to be such as are not only against God, but also against your neighbors, then you shall reconcile yourselves to them, being ready to make restitution and satisfaction according to the utmost of your power, for all injuries and wrongs done by you to any other, and being likewise ready to forgive others that have offended you, as you would have forgiveness of your offences from God's hand; for otherwise the receiving of the Holy Communion does nothing else but increase your damnation. Therefore if any of you be a blasphemer of God, or a hinderer or slanderer of his Word, or an adulterer, or be in malice or envy or in any other grievous crime, repent of your sins, or else do not come to the Holy Table; lest after the taking of that Holy Sacrament the Devil enter into you, as he entered into Judas, and fill you full of all iniquities, and bring you to destruction of both body and soul. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 5</h4><p>5. The way and means (to be received as worthy partakers of that Holy Table) is First, to examine your lives and conversations by the rule of God’s commandments and whereinsoever ye shall perceive yourselves to have offended either by will, word, or deed, there to bewail your own sinfulness, and to confess yourselves to Almighty God, with full purpose of amendment of life. And if ye shall perceive your offences to be such as are not only against God, but also against your neighbours, then ye shall reconcile yourselves unto them, being ready to make restitution and satisfaction according to the utmost of your powers, for all injuries and wrongs done by you to any other, and being likewise ready to forgive others that have offended you, as ye would have forgiveness of your offences at God’s hand: for otherwise the receiving of the Holy Communion doth nothing else but increase your condemnation. Therefore, if any of you be a blasphemer of God, an hinderer or slanderer of his Word, an adulterer, or be in malice, or envy, or in any other grievous crime, repent ye of your sins, or else come not to the Holy Table; lest after the taking of that Holy Sacrament the Devil enter into you, as he entered into Judas, and fill you with all iniquities, and bring you to destruction both of body and soul. </p>

<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 5</h4><p>5. The Exhortation read in England before the people who approach the Sacrament of the Supper, is as follows:<p>The way and means to be received as worthy partakers of that Holy Table is, first, to examine your lives and conversations by the rule of God's commandments; and whereinsoever ye shall perceive yourselves to have offended, either by will, word, or deed, there to bewail your own sinfulness, and to confess yourselves to Almighty God, with full purpose of amendment of life; and if ye shall perceive your offenses to be such as are not only against God, but also against your neighbors, then ye shall reconcile yourselves unto them, being ready to make restitution and satisfaction, according to the uttermost of your powers, for all injuries and wrongs done by you to any other, and being likewise ready to forgive others that have offended you, as ye would have forgiveness of your offenses at God's hand; for otherwise the receiving of the Holy Communion doth nothing else but increase your damnation. Therefore if any of you be a blasphemer of God, a hinderer or slanderer of His Word, an adulterer, or be in malice or envy, or in any other grievous crime, repent you of your sins, or else come not to that Holy Table; lest after the taking of that Holy Sacrament the devil enter into you as he entered into Judas, and fill you full of all iniquities, and bring you to destruction both of body and soul. </p>
