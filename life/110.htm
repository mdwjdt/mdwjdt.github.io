<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》 第110节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life110.自人出生时就构成其内层的恶欲只能被主移走。因为主从属灵之物流入属世之物；但人凭自己则从属世之物流入属灵之物；这种流注违反秩序，不能进入这些欲望实施运作，并移走它们，而是随着它确认、强化它们而把它们关得越来越紧。由于遗传之恶就这样深深潜藏在那里，被关在里面，所以当此人死后成为一个灵时，它就会冲破在世上掩藏它的遮盖物，像仅表面愈合的溃疡中的脓一样爆发出来。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 110</h4><p>110. The compulsions to evil that constitute our deeper nature from birth can be set aside only by the Lord, because the Lord flows from what is spiritual into what is earthly, but of ourselves we flow from what is earthly into what is spiritual. This latter flow goes against the divine design and does not operate on our compulsions and set them aside but envelops them more and more tightly as we reinforce them. So since this means that our inherited evil remains hidden and enclosed within us, when we become spirits after death it bursts the coverings that veiled it on earth and breaks out like pus from an ulcer that has been healed only superficially. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 110</h4><p>110. Urges to evil, which from birth form a person’s inner motivations, are removed only by the Lord. For the Lord flows in from the spiritual level into the natural one, whereas a person of himself proceeds from the natural level into the spiritual one. This latter course is contrary to order, and does not act on the urges and remove them, but shuts them in, more and more tightly as it grows stronger. And because hereditary evil thus lies shut in within, after death, when the person becomes a spirit, it breaks open the covering that had veiled it over in the world and bursts forth, like pus through a sore that was only outwardly healed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 110 </h4>
<p>110. The lusts of evil, which form the interiors of man from his birth, are not removed except by the Lord alone. For the Lord flows in from the spiritual into the natural, but man from himself flows from the natural into the spiritual. Now this, influx is contrary to order, and does not operate upon lusts to their removal, but shuts them in more and more closely as it establishes itself. Further, since hereditary evil, thus shut in, remains concealed, therefore after death, when man becomes a spirit, it bursts the covering in which it had been hidden, and breaks forth as a corrupt discharge from an ulcer that had only been superficially healed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 110</h4><p>110. The concupiscences of evil that constitute the interiors of man from his birth can be removed by the Lord alone. For the Lord inflows from what is spiritual into what is natural; but man, of himself, from what is natural into what is spiritual; and this influx is contrary to order, and does not operate into the concupiscences and remove them, but shuts them in closer and closer in proportion as it confirms itself. And as the hereditary evil thus lurks there, shut in, after death when the man becomes a spirit it bursts the cover that had hidden it here, and breaks out like the discharge from an ulcer that has been healed only outwardly. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 110 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>110. Concupiscentiae mali, quae faciunt interiora hominis a nativitate, non removentur nisi a solo Domino; nam Dominus influit a spirituali in naturale, homo autem ex se a naturali in spirituale; et hic influxus est contra ordinem, et non operatur in concupiscentias et removet illas, sed includit illas, arctius et arctius sicut se confirmat: et quia hereditarium malum sic latet inclusum, illud post mortem, dum homo fit spiritus, rumpit tegmen quo in mundo obvelatum fuit, ac erumpit sicut sanies per ulcus modo exterius sanatum. </p>
