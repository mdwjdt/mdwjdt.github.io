<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life102.主爱人并渴望与他同住；然而，祂无法爱他，也无法与他同住，除非祂被接受，并反过来被爱。结合唯独由此而来。由于这个原因，主赐予人自由和理性，即貌似凭自己思想和意愿的自由，以及他思想和自由所依照的理性。爱一个没有相互作用在里面的人，并与之结合是不可能的；进入一个没有接受在里面的人，并与之同住也是不可能的。由于人的接受和相互作用是主赐予的，所以主说：</p>
<p>你们要住在我里面，我也住在你们里面。（约翰福音15:4）</p>
<p>住在我里面的，我也住在他里面，这人就多结果子。（约翰福音15:5）</p>
<p>到那日，你们就知道你们在我里面，我也在你们里面。（约翰福音14:20）</p>
<p>主还教导，祂存在于一个人所接受并在他里面的真理和良善中：</p>
<p>你们若住在我里面，我的话也住在你们里面。你们若遵守我的诫命，就住在我的爱里。（约翰福音15:7，10）</p>
<p>有了我的诫命又遵守的，这人就是爱我的。我也要爱他，在他那里作我们的住所。（约翰福音14:21，23）</p>
<p>因此，主在祂自己的东西里面与人同住，人则住在那些来自主的事物里面，从而住在主里面。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 102</h4><p>102. The Lord loves us and wants to dwell with us but cannot love and dwell with us unless he is received and loved in return. This is the one and only means to union. This is why the Lord gives us freedom and the power to reason - the freedom of thinking and intending with seeming autonomy, and the power of reason that serves as our guide. It is impossible to love and be united with someone who is unresponsive, impossible to come in and abide with someone who is unreceptive. It is because our own receptiveness and responsiveness are given by the Lord that the Lord said,<p>Abide in me, and I [will abide] in you. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4</a>)<p>Those who abide in me and in whom I abide bear much fruit. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>)<p>On that day you will know that you are in me and I am in you. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>)<p>The Lord also tells us that he is present in whatever is true and good that we have received and that is within us:<p>If you abide in me and my words abide in you ... If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_7.htm">John 15:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_10.htm">10</a>)<p>The people who love me are those who have my commandments and do them; and I will love them and dwell with them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm">23</a>)<p>So the Lord dwells with us in what is his own, and we dwell in what the Lord is giving us and are therefore in the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 102</h4><p>102. The Lord loves people and wills to dwell with them, but he cannot love them and dwell with them unless He is received and loved in return. This and nothing else brings about conjunction. It was for this reason that the Lord gave mankind freedom and reason — the freedom to think and will as though of oneself, and the reason to do so rationally. It is impossible to love someone and be conjoined with him without any reciprocity on his part, and neither is it possible to enter into someone and dwell with him without any receptivity in him.<p>Since the receptivity and reciprocity in a person come from the Lord, therefore the Lord says,<p>Abide in Me, and I in you. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4</a>)<p>He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>)<p>At that day you will know that...you (are) in Me, and I in you. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>)<p>That the Lord is present in the truths and goods that a person receives and has in him is something He also teaches:<p>If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you.... If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love.... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_7.htm">John 15:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_10.htm">10</a>)<p>He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And...I will love him...and make (My) abode with him. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm">23</a>) Thus the Lord dwells in what is from Him in a person, and the person dwells in what He has from the Lord, thus dwelling in the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 102 </h4>
<p>102. The Lord loves man, and desires to dwell with him; yet He cannot love him and dwell with him unless He is received and loved reciprocally; and this is the only possible ground of conjunction. For this cause the Lord has given to man freedom and reason, freedom to think and will as of himself, and reason according to which he may think and will. To love any one and to be conjoined with any one with whom there is no reciprocation is not possible; nor is it possible to enter into and remain with any one with whom there is no reception. Since reception and reciprocity are in man from the Lord, therefore the Lord says:
<p>Abide in me, and I in you. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4</a>.
<p>He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>.
<p>At that day ye shall know that [I am in my Father, and] ye in me, and I in you. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>.
<p>That the Lord is in the truths and in the goods which man receives, and which are in him, He also teaches:
<p>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you... If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_7.htm">John 15:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_10.htm">10</a>.
<p>He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me ... and I will love him ... and will make my abode with him. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm">23</a>.
<p>Thus the Lord dwells in what is His own with man, and man in those things which are from the Lord, and thus in the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 102</h4><p>102. The Lord loves man and wills to dwell with him, yet He cannot love him and dwell with him unless He is received and loved in return. From this alone comes conjunction. For this reason the Lord has given man freedom and reason, freedom to think and will as of himself, and reason in accordance with which he may do so. To love and to be conjoined with one in whom there is nothing reciprocal is not possible, nor is it possible to enter in and abide with one in whom there is no reception. As there are in man, from the Lord, reception and reciprocation, the Lord says:<p>Abide in Me, and I in you (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4</a>).<p>He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p>At that day ye shall know that ye are in Me, and I in you (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>).<p>The Lord also teaches that He is in the truths and in the goods that a man receives, and that are in him:<p>If ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you. If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_7.htm">John 15:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_10.htm">10</a>).<p>He that hath My commandments, and doeth them, he it is that loveth Me and I will love him, and will make My abode with him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm">23</a>).<p>So that the Lord dwells in a man in what is His own, and the man dwells in those things which are from the Lord, and thus dwells in the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 102 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>102. Dominus amat hominem, et vult habitare apud illum; nec potest amare illum et habitare apud illum, nisi recipiatur et reciproce ametur: inde et non aliunde est conjunctio. Dominus propter illam causam dedit homini liberum et rationem; liberum cogitandi et volendi sicut a se, et rationem secundum quam. Amare aliquem et conjungi illi, cui non est reciprocum, non datur; nec intrare ad aliquem et manere apud quem non est receptio. Quoniam receptio et reciprocum in homine sunt a Domino, ideo dicit Dominus, <p>"Manete in Me et Ego in vobis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_102/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_4">Johannes 15:4</a>). <p>"Qui manet in Me, et Ego in illo, hic fert fructum multum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_102/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_5">Johannes 15:5</a>). <p>"In die illo cognoscetis, quod... vos in Me, et Ego in vobis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_102/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_20">Johannes 14:20</a>). <p>Quod Dominus sit in veris et in bonis, quae homo recipit, et sunt apud illum, etiam docet: <p>"Si manseritis in Me, et verba mea in vobis manserint. ...Si mandata mea servaveritis, manebitis in amore meo" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_102/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_7">Johannes 15:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_102/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_10">10</a>). <p>"Qui habet praecepta mea et facit illa, ille... amat Me, et Ego amabo illum, et apud illum habitabo" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_102/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_21">Johannes 14:21</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_102/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_23">23</a>). <p>Ita Dominus habitat in suo apud hominem; et homo in illis quae a Domino sunt, ita in Domino. </p>
