<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">十四、任何人若避开邪恶是为了其它原因，而不是因为它们是罪，就没有避开它们，只是防止它们出现在世人面前</h4><p>Life108.有些道德人遵守十诫第二块石版上的诫命，就是不欺诈、亵渎、报复或奸淫；他们确信这些行为是邪恶，因为这对公共福利是有害的，因而违反人道法则。他们也践行仁爱、诚实、公正和贞洁。但他们若实行这些良善，而避开这些邪恶只是因为它们是邪恶，同时不是因为它们是罪，就仍是纯属世人；对纯属世人来说，恶根仍留在原处，没有除去。因此，他们所行的善事不是良善，因为这些良善来自他们自己。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 108</h4><p>108. If We Turn Our Backs on Evils for Any Other Reason Than That They Are Sins, We Are Not Turning Our Backs on Them but Are Simply Making Sure They Are Not Visible in the Eyes of the World<p>THERE are moral individuals who keep the commandments of the second tablet of the Ten Commandments, who do not cheat, blaspheme, take vengeance, or commit adultery, and who are convinced that such behavior is evil because it is harmful to the state and therefore contrary to the laws of humanity. They also practice caring, honesty, fairness, and chastity.<p>If they are doing these good things and turning their backs on evil things only because the latter are evil, though, and not because they are sins as well, these people are merely earthly, and in merely earthly individuals the root of the evil remains in place and is not removed. So the good things they do are not good, because they arise from the doers themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 108</h4><p>108. If Someone Refrains from Evils for Any Other Reason Than That They Are Sins, He Does Not Really Refrain from Them, but Only Keeps Them from Being Seen by the World<p>There are moral people who keep the precepts of the second table of the Ten Commandments, who do not defraud, do not blaspheme, do not take revenge, and do not commit adultery, and among them some who are personally convinced that such conduct is evil, being harmful to the country and so contrary to laws of humanity, and who also practice charity, honesty, justice, and chastity.<p>However, if they do these goods and refrain from the aforesaid evils only because they are evil, and not at the same time because they are sins, they are still merely natural people, and in merely natural people the root of evil remains deeply seated and is not removed. As a result, the good they do is not good, because it springs from themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 108 </h4>
<p>108. XIV. IF ANY ONE SHUNS EVILS FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN BECAUSE THEY ARE SINS, HE DOES NOT SHUN THEM, BUT ONLY PREVENTS THEM FROM APPEARING BEFORE THE WORLD
<p>There are moral men who keep the commandments of the Second table of the Decalogue, who do not defraud, who do not blaspheme who do not revenge, who do not commit adultery; and such of them as confirm in themselves that these things are evil, because they are hurtful to the state and so are contrary to the laws of humanity, also practise charity, sincerity, justice and chastity. However, if they do these good works and shun those evils only because they are evils and not at the same time because they are sins, they are still merely natural men; and with those who are merely natural, the root of evil remains implanted, and is not removed. Therefore, the good works which they do are not good, because they are of themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 108</h4><p>108. IF ANY ONE SHUNS EVILS FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN BECAUSE THEY ARE SINS, HE DOES NOT SHUN THEM, BUT MERELY PREVENTS THEM FROM APPEARING BEFORE THE WORLD.<p>There are moral men who keep the commandments of the second table of the Decalogue, not committing fraud, blasphemy, revenge, or adultery; and such of them as confirm themselves in the belief that such things are evils because they are injurious to the public weal, and are therefore contrary to the laws of humane conduct, practice charity, sincerity, justice, chastity. But if they do these goods and shun those evils merely because they are evils, and not at the same time because they are sins, they are still merely natural men, and with the merely natural the root of evil remains imbedded and is not dislodged; for which reason the goods they do are not goods, because they are from themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 108 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>108. (XIV.) QUOD SI QUIS FUGIT MALA EX QUACUNQUE ALIA CAUSA, QUAM QUIA PECCATA SUNT, NON FUGIAT ILLA, SED MODO FACIAT UT NON APPAREANT CORAM MUNDO. <p>Dantur morales homines, qui Praecepta secundae tabulae Decalogi servant, non defraudant, non blasphemant, non vindicant, non adulterantur; et qui eorum apud se confirmant, quod talia sint mala, quia damna republicae, et sic contra humanitatis leges, illi etiam charitatem, sinceritatem, justitiam, castitatem exercent. Sed si bona haec faciunt, et mala illa fugiunt, solum quia mala sunt, et non simul quia peccata, illi usque mere naturales sunt; et apud mere naturales radix mali manet insita, et non est emota; quare bona quae faciunt, non sunt bona, quia ab ipsis. </p>
