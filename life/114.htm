<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life114.对于上述内容，补充以下两点：⑴对每个人来说，基督的仁爱在于忠实地履行工作职责，或说从事有用的职业。人若避恶如罪，每天都在行善，并且本身就是自己在共同体中的功用。公共利益和个体的每个成员的利益以这种方式得到照顾或提供。⑵他所行的其它一切事严格来说不是仁爱行为，而要么是仁爱的进一步体现，要么是仁爱的责任，要么是仁爱的义务。（全书完）</p><br><p align="center"><a href="113.htm">上一节</a>　 <a href="0.htm">目录</a></p><hr />
<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 114</h4><p>114. The following should be appended to what has now been said: first, for us all, Christian charity is actually a matter of faithfully performing a useful occupation. If we turn our backs on evils because they are sins, we are daily doing what is good, and are ourselves the useful functions we should be in the body politic. This means that the larger body is being cared for, and so is each member in particular. Second, all the other things we do [outside of our occupation] are not works of charity, strictly speaking, but are either further reflections of our charity, or else simply good deeds or things we are properly obligated to do. </p><h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 114</h4><p>114. To what we have said I will add the following:<p>1. Christian charity for everyone is to perform his function faithfully. For in so doing, if he refrains from evils as being sinful, he daily does good, and he himself becomes his own useful part in the general body. For thus he also promotes the welfare of the whole, and of each of its members in particular.<p>2. All other works are not properly works of charity, but are either its signs, or its benefactions, or its duties. </p><h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 114 </h4>
<p>114. To what has been said above the following may be added:
<p>1. With every one, Christian charity consists in his performing faithfully the duties of his calling; for thus, if he shuns evils as sins, he daily does what is good, and is himself his own use in the common body; thus also the common good is provided for, as well as that of each individual in particular.
<p>2. Other works are not properly works of charity, but are either its signs, or its benefactions, or its obligations. </p><h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 114</h4><p>114. To what has already been said shall be added the following:<p>1.) Christian charity, with everyone, consists in faithfully performing what belongs to his calling, for by this, if he shuns evils as sins, he every day is doing goods, and is himself his own use in the general body. In this way also the common good is cared for, and the good of each person in particular.<p>2.) All other things that he does are not the proper works of charity, but are either its signs, its benefactions, or its obligations. </p>】<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 114 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>114. Supradictis adjicientur haec:- <p>(i.) Quod charitas Christiana sit cuique, ut suam functionem fideliter agat, sic enim, si fugit mala ut peccata, cottidie facit bona, et ipse est suus usus in communi corpore; sic etiam consulitur communi; et unicuique in particulari. <p>(ii.) Quod reliqua non sint propria charitatis opera, sed vel ejus signa, vel beneficia, vel debita. </p><br><p align="center"><a href="113.htm">上一节</a>　 <a href="0.htm">目录</a>　 <a href="115.htm">下一节</a></p></div>
