<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life96.一个与邪恶争战的人不能不貌似凭自己如此行，因为人若不貌似凭自己争战，就根本没有争战，而是站在那里像一个机器人，什么也看不见，什么也不做，还出于邪恶不断思想支持邪恶，而不是反对它。然而，要清楚知道，唯独主在人里面与他的邪恶争战，只是在这个人看来，他似乎凭自己争战，主也愿意在他看来是这样，因为没有这种表象，就没有争战发生，因而没有改造。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 96</h4><p>96. When we battle against what is evil, we cannot help but fight using what seems to be our own strength, because if we are not using what seems to be our own strength, we are not doing battle. We are standing there like an automaton, seeing nothing and doing nothing, while constantly thinking on the basis of evil and in favor of it, not against it.<p>However, we need to be quite clear about the fact that it is the Lord alone who is fighting within us against the evils, that it only seems as though we are using our own strength for the battle, and that the Lord wants it to seem like that because if it does not, no battle occurs, so there is no reformation either. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 96</h4><p>96. A person who battles against evils cannot but battle as though on his own, for someone who does not do so as though on his own does not do battle. Rather he stands like a robot, seeing nothing and doing nothing, and is continually prompted by evil to think in favor of it and not in opposition to it.<p>However, it must still be rightly known that the Lord alone battles against the evils in a person, that it only appears to the person that he struggles on his own, and that the Lord wills it to appear so to him, since without that appearance there would be no battle, thus no reformation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 96 </h4>
<p>96. The man who fights against evils cannot but fight as of himself; for he who does not fight as of himself does not fight, but stands like an automaton, seeing nothing and doing nothing; and from the evil in which he is, he continually thinks in favour of evil, and not against it. But still it should be clearly understood that the Lord alone fights in man against evils, and that it only appears to man as if he fought from himself; and that the Lord wills that it should so appear to man, since without this appearance there could be no combat and consequently no reformation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 96</h4><p>96. A man who fights against evils cannot but do so as of himself, for one who does not fight as of himself does not do so at all, but stands like an automaton that sees nothing and does nothing, and from evil he is continually thinking in favor of evil, and not against it. But be it well known that it is the Lord alone who fights in a man against his evils, and that it only appears to the man that he fights of himself, and also that the Lord wills that it should so appear to him, because without this appearance no combat takes place and therefore no reformation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 96 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>96. Homo qui contra mala pugnat, non potest non pugnare sicut a se; nam qui non sicut a se, ille non pugnat, stat sicut automaton nihil videns et nihil agens, et continue cogitat ex malo pro illo, et non contra illud. Sed usque probe sciendum est, quod solus Dominus pugnet in homine contra mala, et quod modo appareat homini sicut ille pugnet ex se, et quod Dominus velit ut ita homini appareat, quoniam absque illa apparentia non existit pugna, ita nec reformatio. </p>
