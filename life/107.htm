<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life107.如果人没有接受并貌似凭自己思考的能力，那么就没有什么东西能论及信，因为信并非来自人。没有这种接受和回应的能力，人就像风中的糠秕，仿佛毫无生命地站立，张嘴垂手，等待流注，在关乎他得救的事上什么都不想，什么都不做。诚然，他在这些事上什么都没做；然而，他确实貌似凭自己作出反应。这些主题在关于天使智慧的著作中将有更清晰的阐述。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 107</h4><p>107. If we did not have the power to be receptive and therefore had no apparent ability to think independently, faith could not have even entered the discussion, since faith does not come from us either. If it were not for that ability to be receptive, we would be like straw blowing in the wind, and would stand around lifelessly, with our mouths gaping and our hands hanging limp, waiting for something to flow in, neither thinking nor doing anything about what matters for our salvation. We are in no way the active force in these matters, true, but we do react seemingly on our own.<p>These matters will be presented in still clearer light, though, in the works on angelic wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 107</h4><p>107. If there were not this receptivity on a person’s part, and thought then as though of himself, nothing could be said about faith, for faith comes not from man. A person would otherwise be like straw in the wind, or like someone standing seemingly lifeless, with mouth open and hands hanging down, awaiting influx, thinking nothing and doing nothing in matters having to do with his salvation. He is, indeed, not the actor in these matters, but still he is the reactor, reacting as though of himself.<p>But this will be presented in a still clearer light in treatises titled Angelic Wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 107 </h4>
<p>107. If man did not have the faculty of reception and also of thinking as of himself, nothing could have been said about faith, for neither does faith originate with man. Without this faculty man would be like chaff in the wind, and would stand as if lifeless with mouth open and hands hanging down, waiting for influx, thinking nothing and doing nothing in those matters which concern his salvation. He indeed does nothing in those matters, but yet he does respond as of himself. But these subjects will be set in still clearer light in the treatises on Angelic Wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 107</h4><p>107. Unless there were reception by man, and at the same time a taking thought as it were by him, nothing could have been said about faith, for faith is not from man. Without this reception and reciprocality, man would be like chaff in the wind, and would stand as if lifeless, with mouth open, and hands hanging down, awaiting influx, devoid of thought and action in regard to the things that concern his salvation. It is indeed true that he is by no means the agent in regard to these things, but yet he is a reagent as of himself.<p>But these matters will be set forth in still clearer light in the treatises on Angelic Wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 107 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>107. Si non receptio ab homine foret, et tunc cogitatio sicut ab illo, nec aliquid dici potuisset de fide; nam fides nec est ab homine: alioquin foret homo sicut palea in vento, et staret sicut inanimatus, ore aperto et manibus remissis exspectans influxum, nihil cogitans et nihil agens in illis quae salutis ejus sunt: est quidem nihil agens in illis, sed usque est reagens sicut a se. <p>Sed haec in adhuc clariorem lucem mittentur in transactionibus de Sapientia Angelica. </p>
