<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life75.任何人避开奸淫到何等程度，就在何等程度上热爱婚姻；或也可说，任何人避开奸淫的淫乱到何等程度，就在何等程度上热爱婚姻的贞洁。这是因为奸淫的淫乱和婚姻的贞洁是两种对立的事物；这意味着任何人在何等程度上不在这一个里面，就在何等程度上在另一个里面。这与前面（70节）说的一样。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 75</h4><p>75. The reason people love marriage to the extent that they turn their backs on adultery - or to be more precise, love the chastity of marriage to the extent that they turn their backs on the lechery of adultery - is that the lechery of adultery and the chastity of marriage are two opposite things. This means that to the extent that we are not intent on the one we are intent on the other. This is exactly like what has been said in <a href="../life/70.htm">70</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 75</h4><p>75. The fact is that insofar as someone refrains from adultery, so far he loves marriage, or to say the equivalent, insofar as someone refrains from the lasciviousness of adultery, so far he loves the chasteness of marriage, and the reason is that the lasciviousness of adultery and the chasteness of marriage are two opposites. Consequently, the more a person refrains from one, the more he comes into the other. The case is precisely as stated in no. <a href="../life/70.htm">70</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 75 </h4>
<p>75. So far as any one shuns adultery, so far he loves marriage, or, what is the same, so far as any one shuns the lasciviousness of adultery, so far he loves the chastity of marriage. This is because the lasciviousness of adultery and the chastity of marriage are two opposites; and therefore so far as a man is not in the one, so far he is in the other. It is precisely as was stated above No. <a href="70.htm">70</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 75</h4><p>75. That in proportion as anyone shuns adultery, in the same proportion he loves marriage; or what is the same, in proportion as anyone shuns the lasciviousness of adultery, in the same proportion he loves the chastity of marriage, is because the lasciviousness of adultery and the chastity of marriage are two opposite things, and therefore in proportion as anyone is not in the one, he is in the other. It is precisely as has been said above at n. 70. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 75 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>75. Quod quantum quis fugit adulterium, tantum amet conjugium, seu quod idem, quantum quis fugit lasciviam adulterii, tantum amet castitatem conjugii, est, quia lascivia adulterii et castitas conjugii sunt duo opposita; quare quantum non in uno est, tantum in altero est: est prorsus sicut dictum est supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_75/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_70">70</a>). </p>
