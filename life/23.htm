<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life23.从上述内容可以得出这三个必然结论：</p>
<p>⑴如果一个人在避恶如罪之前意愿并实行良善，那么他所意愿并实行的良善不是良善。</p>
<p>⑵如果一个人思想并言说虔诚的事，却不避恶如罪，那么他所思所说的这些虔诚事都不虔诚。</p>
<p>⑶如果一个人拥有大量知识和大量智慧，却不避恶如罪，那么他仍没有智慧。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 23</h4><p>23. There are three corollaries to this.<p>1. If we intend and do good deeds before we turn our backs on evil deeds because they are sins, our good deeds are not good.<p>2. If we think and speak devoutly but do not turn our backs on evil deeds because they are sins, our devout thoughts and words are not devout.<p>3. Even if we are well informed and insightful, if we do not turn our backs on evil deeds because they are sins, we are not wise. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 23</h4><p>23. From all this, three conclusions follow:<p>1. That if a person wills and does good before he refrains from evils as being sins, the good that he does is not good.<p>2. That if a person thinks and speaks piously, and does not refrain from evils as being sins, his pious thoughts and words are not pious.<p>3. That if a person gains much knowledge and wisdom, and does not refrain from evils as being sins, he is still not wise. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 23 </h4>
<p>23. From what has been said, these three consequences follow:
<p>1. If a man wills and does what is good before he shuns evils as sins, the good things which he wills and does are not good.
<p>2. If a man thinks and speaks pious things, and does not shun evils as sins, the pious things [which he thinks and speaks] are not pious.
<p>3. If a man has much knowledge and much wisdom and does not shun evils as sins, he is nevertheless not wise. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 23</h4><p>23. From what has been said three things follow:<p>1) If a man wills and does goods before he shuns evils as sins, the goods are not good.<p>2) If a man thinks and speaks pious things while not shunning evils as sins, the pious things are not pious.<p>3) If a man knows and is wise in many things, and does not shun evils as sins, he is nevertheless not wise. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 23 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>23. Ex his sunt tria haec consequentia: <p>(i.) Quod si homo bona vult et facit, antequam fugit mala ut peccata, bona non sint bona. <p>(ii.) Quod si homo pia cogitat et loquitur, et non fugit mala ut peccata, pia non sint pia. <p>(iii.) Quod si homo scit et sapit multa, et non fugit mala ut peccata, usque non sapiat. </p>
