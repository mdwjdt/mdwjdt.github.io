<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》 第66节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life66.我们在马可福音中读到：</p>
<p>有一个富人来到耶稣这里，问祂，他当做什么事才可以承受永生，耶稣对他说，诫命你是晓得的：不可奸淫，不可杀人，不可偷盗，不可作假见证，不可欺诈，当尊敬你的父母。他回答说，这一切我从小都遵守了。耶稣看着他，就爱他，然而却对他说，你还缺少一件；去变卖你所有的，分给穷人，就必有财宝在天上；你还要来背起十字架跟从我。（马可福音10:17-22）</p>
<p>经上说耶稣就“爱他”。这是因为这个人说他从小就遵守这些诫命。但因他还缺少三件事，就是他还没有使自己的心摆脱财富，没有与欲望争战，尚未承认主为神，所以主叫他“去变卖他所有的”，以此表示他要使自己的心摆脱财富；还叫他“背起十字架”，以此表示他要与欲望争战；又叫他“跟从祂”，以此表示他要承认主为神。主以对应来说这些话，和说其它话一样（参看《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》，17节）。事实上，没有人能避恶如罪，除非他承认主并转向祂，与邪恶争战，从而除去欲望。关于这些事的详情可参看关于与邪恶争战那一章（92-100节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 66</h4><p>66. We read in Mark that a certain rich man came to Jesus and asked him what he needed to do in order to inherit eternal life. Jesus said, "You know the commandments: you are not to commit adultery; you are not to kill; you are not to steal; you are not to bear false witness; you are not to commit fraud; honor your father and mother." He replied, "Since my youth I have kept all these things." Jesus looked at him and loved him, but said, "One thing you lack: Go, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, take up the cross, and follow me" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_17.htm">Mark 10:17-22</a>).</p><p>[2] It says that Jesus loved him, and this was because he had kept the commandments since his youth. Because he lacked three things, though - he had not detached his heart from wealth, he had not fought against his cravings, and he had not yet acknowledged the Lord as God - the Lord told him that he was to sell everything he had, meaning that he was to detach his heart from wealth; that he was to take up the cross, meaning that he was to fight against his cravings; and that he was to follow him, meaning that he was to acknowledge the Lord as God. The Lord said these things the way he said everything else - in correspondences (see <a href="../ss/17.htm">Teachings on the Sacred Scripture 17</a>). The fact is that we - and this means everyone - cannot turn our backs on evils because they are sins unless we acknowledge the Lord and turn to him, and unless we fight against evils, and in this way distance ourselves from our cravings.<p>More on this, though, under the heading concerning doing battle against evils [<a href="../life/92.htm">92-100</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 66</h4><p>66. We read in Mark that a certain rich man came to Jesus and asked Him what he should do to inherit eternal life.<p>Jesus said to him, “You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your father and your mother.”<p>The rich man answered and said to Him, “All these things I have kept from my youth.”<p>Jesus, looked at him and loved him. Nevertheless He said, “One thing you lack: Go, sell whatever you have and give it to the poor. By doing so you will have treasure in heaven. But come, take up the cross and follow Me.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_17.htm">Mark 10:17-22</a>)</p><p>[2] We are told that Jesus loved him because he said that he had kept those commandments from his youth. But he lacked three things, namely, that he had not withdrawn his heart from his riches, that he had not fought against his urges, and that he had not yet acknowledged the Lord as God. For that reason the Lord told him to sell whatever he had, meaning that he should withdraw his heart from his riches; to take up the cross, meaning to fight against his lusts; and to follow Him, meaning to acknowledge the Lord as God.<p>The Lord said all this, as He did everything else, using terms that correspond, as may be seen in The <a href="../ss/17.htm">Doctrine Regarding the Sacred Scripture 17</a>.<p>For no one can refrain from evils as being sins unless he acknowledges the Lord and turns to Him, and unless he fights against evils and so puts away his urges to do them.<p>But more on this subject in the section dealing with battles against evils. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 66 </h4>
<p>66. We read in Mark that
<p>A certain rich man came to Jesus, and asked Him what he should do to inherit eternal life: to whom Jesus replied, Thou knowest the commandments: Thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; thou shalt not defraud; honour thy father and mother. He answering said, All these have I kept from my youth. Jesus looked upon him, and loved him; and yet He said ... One thing thou lackest; go, sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor; thus thou shalt have treasure in the heavens; and come, take up the cross, and follow me. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_17.htm">Mark 10:17-22</a>.
<p> </p>
<p>[2] It is said that Jesus loved him. This was because he said that he had kept the commandments from his youth. But, because he lacked three things, namely, that he had not removed his heart from riches, that he had not fought against lusts, and that he had not yet acknowledged the Lord to be God, therefore the Lord said that he should sell all that he had, by which is meant that he should remove his heart from riches; that he should bear the cross, by which is meant that he should fight against lusts; and that he should follow Him, by which is meant that he should acknowledge the Lord to be God. The Lord spoke these words, as He did all His words, by correspondences (see <a href="../ss/17.htm">DOCTRINE CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 17</a>). For no one can shun evils as sins unless he acknowledges the Lord and approaches Him; and unless he fights against evils, and thereby removes lusts. But more will be said on this subject in the article concerning combats against evils. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 66</h4><p>66. We read in Mark:<p>That a certain rich man came to Jesus, and asked Him what he should do to inherit eternal life, and that Jesus said to him, Thou knowest the commandments: Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not be a false witness, Thou shalt not defraud, Honor thy father and mother. And he answering said, All these things have I kept from my youth. And Jesus looked upon him and loved him, yet said unto him, One thing thou lackest; go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor; so shalt thou have treasure in the heavens; and come, take up the cross and follow Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_17.htm">Mark 10:17-22</a>).<p>It is said that Jesus "loved him." This was because the man said that he had kept those commandments from his youth. But because he lacked three things, which were that he had not removed his heart from riches, had not fought against concupiscences, and had not yet acknowledged the Lord to be God, the Lord said that he should "sell all that he had," by which is meant that he should remove his heart from riches; that he should "take up the cross," by which is meant that he should fight against concupiscences; and that he should "follow Him," by which is meant that he should acknowledge the Lord to be God. The Lord spoke these things as He spoke all things by correspondences. (See the <a href="../ss/17.htm">DOCTRINE CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 17</a>.) For no one is able to shun evils as sins unless he acknowledges the Lord and goes to Him, and unless he fights against evils and so removes concupiscences. But more about these matters in the chapter on combats against evils. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 66 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>66. Legitur apud Marcum, <p>Quod quidam dives venerit ad Jesum, et interrogaverit Ipsum, quid faceret ut vitam aeternam hereditario acciperet: cui dixit Jesus, "Praecepta nosti, Non moechaberis, non occides, non furaberis, non eris falsus testis, non defraudabis, honora patrem tuum et matrem: ille... respondens dixit..., Haec omnia custodivi a juventute: Jesus... aspexit illum, et amavit illum: dixit tamen..., Unum tibi deest, abi, quaecunque habes, vende, et da pauperibus, ita habebis thesaurum in caelis; veni tamen, sequere Me, tollens crucem" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_66/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_10_17-22">10:17-22</a>). <p>Dicitur quod Jesus amaverit illum, hoc quia dixit quod illa praecepta custodiverit a juventute; sed quia tria ei deerant, quae sunt, quod cor suum non removerit a divitiis, quod non pugnaverit contra concupiscentias, et quod nondum agnoverit Dominum pro Deo, ideo dixit Dominus, , quod "venderet omnia quae haberet," per quod intelligitur quod removeret cor a divitiis, quod "tolleret crucem," per quod intelligitur quod pugnaret contra concupiscentias, et quod "sequeretur Ipsum," per quod intelligitur quod agnosceret Dominum pro Deo. Dominus haec ut omnia locutus est per correspondentias (videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_66/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_17">Doctrina de Scriptura Sacra 17</a>); fugere enim mala ut peccata, nemo potest nisi agnoscat Dominum, et Ipsum adeat, et nisi pugnet contra mala, et sic removeat concupiscentias. Sed de his plura, in articulo de pugnis contra mala. </p>
