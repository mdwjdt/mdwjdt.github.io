<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life93.由于人的这种自我或自我中心构成他生命的主根，所以显而易见，若不拔除这根，植入新根以取代之，一个人会成为哪种树。他会成为一棵腐朽的树，论到这树，经上说：它必被砍下来丢在火里（马太福音3:10；7:19）。这根不会被除去，新根也不会取代它的位置，除非这个人看到构成这根的邪恶对他的灵魂是有害的，并因此想要逐出它们。然而，由于这些邪恶属于人的自我或自我中心，因而给予他快乐，所以他若不反对他的意愿，面对抗争或反对，因而若不通过战斗，就不可能做到这一点。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 93</h4><p>93. Since this self-centeredness is the taproot of the life we lead, we can see what kind of trees we would be if this root were not pulled up and a new root planted. We would be rotten trees that needed to be cut down and thrown into the fire (see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_3_10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_19.htm">7:19</a>).<p>This root is not removed and a new one put in its place unless we see that the evils that constitute it are harmful to our souls, and therefore we want to banish them. However, since they are part of our self-centeredness and therefore give us pleasure, we can do this only reluctantly and in the face of opposition, and therefore by doing battle. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 93</h4><p>93. Since a person’s life is first rooted in this inherent character, it is apparent what kind of tree a person would become if that root were not pulled up and a new root planted. He would be a rotten tree, which, we are told in Matthew, will be cut down and thrown into the fire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_3_10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_19.htm">7:19</a>).<p>This root is not removed and a new one introduced in its place unless the person regards the evils that form the root as harmful to his soul and for that reason wishes to banish them. But because they are part of his inherent character and thus delightful, he cannot do so except unwillingly, and with reluctance, thus with a struggle. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 93 </h4>
<p>93. Since this proprium of man constitutes the first root of his life, it is evident what sort of a tree a man would become if this root were not extirpated and a new root implanted. He would be a rotten tree, of which it is said that it is to be cut down and cast into the fire, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_3_10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_19.htm">Matthew 7:19</a>. This root is not removed and a new one implanted in its stead, unless a man regards the evils which constitute the root as hurtful to his soul, and on that account desires to remove them. But since they belong to his proprium and are consequently delightful to him, he cannot remove them except unwillingly and by struggling against them, and thus by combat. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 93</h4><p>93. As this Own of man constitutes the first root of his life, it is evident what kind of a tree a man would be unless this root were plucked up, and a new root planted in its place. He would be a rotted tree, of which it is said that it must be cut down and cast into the fire (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_3_10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_19.htm">7:19</a>). And this root is not removed and a new one set in its place unless the man regards the evils that constitute the root as injurious to his soul, and on this account desires to rid himself of them. But as these evils belong to man's Own, and are therefore delightful to him, he cannot do this except against his will, with a struggle, and therefore with battling. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 93 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>93. Quoniam hoc proprium hominis primam radicem vitae ejus facit, patet qualis homo arbor foret, si non illa radix exstirparetur, et nova radix implantaretur: foret arbor putris, de qua dicitur, quod exscindenda et in ignem conjicienda sit (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_93/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_3_10">Matthaeus 3:10</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_93/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_7_19">7:19</a>). Haec radix non removetur, et nova loco ejus inditur, nisi homo spectat mala, quae faciunt radicem, ut damna animae suae, et propterea vult abalienare illa; sed quia sunt proprii ejus, et inde jucunda, non potest id nisi invito, et cum lucta, ita cum pugna. </p>
