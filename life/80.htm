<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">十、任何人避各种偷盗如罪到何等程度，就在何等程度上热爱诚实</h4><p>Life80.就属世意义而言，“偷盗”不仅表示盗窃和抢劫，还表示欺诈，以某种借口攫取他人财物。但就属灵意义而已，“偷盗”表示剥夺他人的信之真理和仁之良善。就至高意义而言，“偷盗”表示将属于主的东西从主那里夺去，并将其归给人自己，因而为人自己索取公义和功德。这些就是“各种偷盗”。它们也构成一体，和前面（74-79，67-73节）所描述的各种奸淫、各种杀人一样。它们之所以构成一体，是因为它们是一个在另一个里面。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 80</h4><p>80. To the Extent That We Turn Our Backs on All Kinds of Theft Because They Are Sins, We Love Honesty<p>IN earthly terms, "theft" means not only theft and robbery but also cheating and taking other people's assets by some pretext. Spiritually understood, though, "theft" means depriving others of the truths of their faith and good actions motivated by their caring, while in the highest sense it means taking from the Lord what is properly his and claiming it for ourselves - that is, claiming righteousness and worth for ourselves. These are "all kinds of theft, " and like "all kinds of adultery" and "all kinds of killing, " as just described [<a href="../life/74.htm">74-79</a> and <a href="../life/67.htm">67-73</a>], they too are united. They are united because one is within the other. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 80</h4><p>80. Insofar as Someone Refrains from Every Form of Stealing as Being a Sin, So Far He Loves Honesty<p>In the natural sense stealing means not only to steal and rob, but also to swindle and by some subterfuge take from another his goods. In the spiritual sense stealing means to deprive another of the truths of his faith and the goods of his charity. And in the highest sense stealing means to take from the Lord something that is His and attribute it to oneself, thus to claim His righteousness and merit for oneself.<p>These are all forms of stealing. And they are also bound up together, as are all forms of adultery and all forms of murder, as we discussed above. They are bound up together because one is present in another. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 80 </h4>
<p>80. X. SO FAR AS ANY ONE SHUNS ALL KINDS OF THEFT AS SINS, SO FAR HE LOVES SINCERITY
<p>By stealing, in the natural sense, is meant not only to commit theft and robbery, but also to defraud, and under any pretence to take away from another his goods. But by stealing, in the spiritual sense, is meant to deprive another of the truths of his faith and the goods of his charity. In the supreme sense, by stealing is meant to take away from the Lord what is His and to attribute it to oneself, and thus to claim for oneself righteousness and merit. These comprise all kinds of theft; and they also make one, as do all kinds of adultery and murder, spoken of above. They make one, because one kind is involved in the other. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 80</h4><p>80. IN PROPORTION AS ANY ONE SHUNS THEFTS OF EVERY KIND AS SINS, IN THE SAME PROPORTION HE LOVES SINCERITY.<p>To "steal," in the natural sense, means not only to commit theft and robbery, but also to defraud, and under some pretext take from another his goods. But in the spiritual sense to "steal" means to deprive another of his truths of faith and his goods of charity. And in the highest sense to "steal" means to take away from the Lord that which is His, and attribute it to one's self, and thus to claim righteousness and merit for one's self. These are the "thefts of every kind." And they also make a one, as do adulteries of every kind, and murders of every kind, of which we have already treated. The reason why they make a one is that they are one within another. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 80 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>80. (X.) QUOD QUANTUM QUIS OMNIS GENERIS FURTA UT PECCATA FUGIT, TANTUM SINCERITATEM AMET. <p>Per "furari" in naturali sensu non modo intelligitur furari et latrocinari, sed etiam defraudare, et sub aliqua specie alteri sua bona auferre. Per "furari" autem in spirituali sensu intelligitur deprivare alium suae fidei veris et suae charitatis bonis. In supremo vero sensu per "furari" intelligitur auferre Domino quae Ipsius sunt, et sibi illa attribuere, ita vindicare sibi justitiam et meritum, Haec sunt omnis generis furta. Et quoque unum faciunt, sicut omnis generis adulteria, et omnis generis homicidia, de quibus prius: quod unum faciant, est quia unum est in altero. </p>
