<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》 第57节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life57.这律法因是主与人并人与主联结或结合的方法，故被称为一个“约”和一个“见证”：被称为“约”，是因为它进行联结或结合；被称为“见证”，是因为它作见证。这就是为何石版有两块，一块为主，一块为人。联结或结合由主实现，但只有当人行出写在他石版上的事时才会实现。因为主不断同在和作工，想要进来，但人必须在主所赋予他的自由中向主打开门；因为主说：</p>
<p>看哪，我站在门外叩门，若有人听见我声音就开门，我要进到他那里去，我与他，他与我一同坐席。（启示录3:20）</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 57</h4><p>57. Because that law is the means of the Lord's union with us and our union with the Lord, it is called a covenant and a testimony - a covenant because it unites and a testimony because it bears witness.<p>That is why there were two tablets, one for the Lord and one for us. The union is effected by the Lord, but it is effected when we do what is written on our tablet. That is, the Lord is constantly present and active and wanting to come in, but because of the freedom he gives us, it is up to us to open [the door], for he says,<p>Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to them and dine with them and they with me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 57</h4><p>57. Since that law is the means of the Lord’s conjunction with a person, and of a person with the Lord, it is called a covenant and a testimony — a covenant because it conjoins, and a testimony because it testifies. For a covenant symbolizes a conjunction, and a testimony symbolizes a testification of that conjunction.<p>For that reason there were two tablets, one for the Lord, the other for man. Conjunction is brought about by the Lord, but only when someone keeps the commandments written on man’s tablet. For the Lord is continually present and acting, and wishes to enter in, but a person must open the way, using the freedom to do so that he has from the Lord. For the Lord says:<p>Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 57 </h4>
<p>57. Since there is conjunction of the Lord with man, and of man with the Lord, by means of the Law, it is called the Covenant and the Testimony; the Covenant because it conjoins, and the Testimony because it bears witness. On this account there were two tables, one for the Lord and the other for man. Conjunction is effected by the Lord, but only when man does what is written on his table. For the Lord is continually present and operative, and desires to enter; but it is man's part, from the freedom which he has from the Lord, to open; for He says:
<p>Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 57</h4><p>57. As by means of this Law there is a conjunction of the Lord with man and of man with the Lord, it is called the "Covenant," and the "Testimony," the "Covenant" because it conjoins, and the "Testimony" because it bears witness, for a "covenant" signifies conjunction, and a "testimony" the attestation of it. For this reason there were two tables, one for the Lord and the other for man. The conjunction is effected by the Lord, but only when the man does the things that have been written in his table. For the Lord is constantly present and working, and wills to enter in, but man must open to the Lord in the freedom which he has from Him; for the Lord says:<p>Behold, I stand at the door, and knock; if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 57 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>57. Quoniam per Legem illam est conjunctio Domini cum homine, et hominis cum Domino, vocatur illa Foedus et Testimonium Foedus quia conjungit, et Testimonium quia testatur; nam "foedus" significat conjunctionem, ac "testimonium" testificationem ejus. Propterea tabulae illae erant binae, una pro Domino, altera pro homine. Conjunctio fit a Domino; sed tunc cum homo facit illa quae in ejus tabula scripta sunt. Dominus enim continue praesens est et operatur, et vult ingredi, sed homo ex suo libero, quod illi a Domino est, aperiet; nam dicit, "Ecce sto ad januam et pulso; si quis audiverit vocem meam, et aperuerit januam, ingrediar ad illum, et cenabo cum illo, et ille Mecum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_57/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_20">Apocalypsis 3:20</a>). </p>
