<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life41.综上所述，明显可知：人若避恶如罪，就会热爱并渴望真理；并且他越避开邪恶，就越热爱并渴望真理，因为他越处于良善。结果，他就进入天堂的婚姻，也就是良善与真理的婚姻；天堂就在这婚姻中，教会也必在其中。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 41</h4><p>41. We may conclude from what has been said that if we turn our backs on evils because they are sins, then we love truths and long for them. The more resolutely we turn our backs, the more we love and long for truths, because we are that much more focused on what is good. This is how we attain the heavenly marriage that is the marriage of goodness and truth, the marriage in which heaven is and the church should be. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 41</h4><p>41. From what we have said, it can now be seen that someone who refrains from evils as being sins loves truths and desires them, and that the more he refrains, the more he loves and desires, because the more he is prompted by goodness.<p>By this he comes into the heavenly marriage, the marriage of goodness and truth that governs heaven and which ought to govern the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 41 </h4>
<p>41. From what has been said it may now be evident, that he who shuns evils as sins loves truths and desires them; and that the more he shuns evils, the more he loves and desires truths, because he is the more principled in good. He thus comes into the heavenly marriage, or the marriage of good and truth, in which heaven is, and in which the Church shall be. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 41</h4><p>41. From all that has been said it is now evident that he who shuns evils as sins, loves truths and longs for them; and that the more he shuns them, so much the more love and longing does he feel, because so much the more he is in good. The result is that he comes into the heavenly marriage, which is the marriage of good and truth, in which is heaven, and in which must be the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 41 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>41. Ex dictis nunc constare potest, quod qui fugit mala ut peccata, amet vera ac desideret illa; et quo plus fugit, eo plus amet et desideret, quia eo plus in bono est. Inde venit in conjugium caeleste, quod est conjugium boni et veri, in quo est caelum, et erit ecclesia. </p>
