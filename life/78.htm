<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life78.“奸淫”也表示做淫秽的事，说猥亵的话，思想肮脏的东西，这一点从主在马太福音中的话明显看出来：</p>
<p>你们听见有吩咐古人的话，说，不可奸淫；只是我告诉你们：凡看见妇女就动淫念的，这人心里已经与她犯奸淫了。（马太福音5:27-28）</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 78</h4><p>78. We can tell from what the Lord says in Matthew that adultery also means lecherous behavior, lewd conversation, and filthy thoughts:<p>You have heard that it was said by the ancients, "You are not to commit adultery;" but I tell you that anyone who has looked at someone else's wife in order to desire her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 78</h4><p>78. That to commit adultery also means to engage in obscene acts, to speak lasciviously, and to entertain filthy thoughts is clear from the Lord’s words in Matthew:<p>You have heard that it was said to those of old, “You shall not commit adultery.” But I say to you that whoever looks at (another’s) woman so as to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 78 </h4>
<p>78. That by committing adultery is also meant to commit obscene acts, speak lascivious words, and think filthy thoughts, is evident from the Lord's words in Matthew:
<p>Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
<p>But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a strange woman (A.V. a woman) to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 78</h4><p>78. That to "commit adultery" means also to do obscene things, to speak lascivious things, and to think about filthy things, is evident from the Lord's words in Matthew:<p>Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery but I say unto you that whosoever looketh on the woman of another to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 78 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>78. Quod per "adulterari" etiam intelligatur obscena facere, lasciva loqui, et spurca cogitare, constat a Domini verbis apud Matthaeum: <p>"Audivistis quod veteribus dictum sit, Non adulteraberis: Ego vero dico vobis, quod si quis aspexerit mulierem alienam, ita ut concupiscat eam, jam adulterium cum illa commiserit in corde suo" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_78/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_5_27-28">5:27-28</a>). </p>
