<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life77.由此可以毫无疑问地推断并看出一个人是不是一个基督徒，甚至一个人有没有宗教信仰。一个人若不出于他的信仰和生活视奸淫为罪，就不是一个基督徒，也没有任何宗教信仰。另一方面，一个人若避奸淫如罪，尤其因此躲避它们，更尤其因此憎恶它们，就拥有宗教信仰；他若在基督教会，就是一个基督徒。关于这些问题的详情可见于关于婚姻这本小册子，同时可参看《天堂与地狱》一书关于这个主题的说明（366-386节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 77</h4><p>77. This enables us to conclude and see beyond doubt whether someone is a Christian or not, in fact whether or not someone has any religion at all. People who do not regard adultery as a sin in their faith and their way of life are not Christians and have no religion. On the other hand, people who turn their backs on adultery as a sin, and more so people who steer clear of it altogether for that reason, and even more so people who detest it for that reason, do have a religion, and if they are in the Christian church, they are Christians.<p>There will be more on this in the booklet on marriage, though; and in the meanwhile those interested may consult what it says on this subject in <a href="../hh/366.htm">Heaven and Hell 366-386</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 77</h4><p>77. From this one may conclude and see for certain whether a person is a Christian or not — indeed, whether a person has any religion or not. Someone who, in faith and in life, does not regard adultery as a sin, is not a Christian and does not have any religion. But conversely, someone who refrains from adulterous affairs as sinful, still more someone who on that account finds them repugnant, and even more someone who on that account abhors them, does have religion, and if he is in the Christian Church, is a Christian.<p>More on this subject, however, may be found in the little work on marriage. In the meantime see what we have said about it in the book <a href="../hh/366.htm">Heaven and Hell 366-386</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 77 </h4>
<p>77. From these considerations it may be concluded and seen without doubt whether a man is a Christian or not: indeed, whether a man has any religion or not. He who does not regard adulteries as sins, both in faith and in life, is not a Christian, neither has he any religion. But on the other hand, he who shuns adulteries as sins, and especially he who on that account holds them in aversion, and still more he who on that account abominates them, has religion, and if he is in the Christian Church he is a Christian. But more will be seen on this subject in the treatise on MARRIAGE. Meantime see what is said concerning it in the work on HEAVEN AND HELL Nos. <a href="../hh/366.htm">Heaven and Hell 366-386</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 77</h4><p>77. From all this we can conclude and see, in no dubious manner, whether a man is a Christian or not, and even whether a man has any religion or not. If from his faith and from his life a man does not regard adulteries as sins, then he is not a Christian, and neither has he any religion. And on the other hand, if a man shuns adulteries as sins, and especially if on that account he feels aversion for them, and still more especially if on that account he abhors them, then he has religion, and if he is in the Christian Church he is a Christian. (But more about these matters in the little work entitled De Conjugio, and in the meantime see what has been said on this subject in the work on <a href="../hh/366.htm">Heaven and Hell 366-386</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 77 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>77. Ex his non ambigue concludi et videri potest, num homo sit Christianus vel non; immo num homini aliqua religio sit vel non. Qui adulteria ex fide et vita non facit peccata, ille non Christianus est, nec illi religio est: vicissim autem, qui adulteria ut peccata fugit, et magis qui propterea aversatur illa, et adhuc magis qui propterea abominatur illa, illi religio est, et si in Ecclesia Christiana est, Christianus est. Sed de his plura in opusculo De Conjugio: interea videantur quae in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_77/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_366">De Caelo et Inferno 366-386</a> de illis dicta sunt. </p>
