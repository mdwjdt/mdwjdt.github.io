<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》 第30节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life30.圣言教导，只要一个人没有从恶中洁净，他的善行就不是良善，他的虔诚行为也不虔诚，他没有智慧；反之亦然。以下经文教导了这一点：</p>
<p>你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们好像粉饰的坟墓，外面好看，里面却装满了死人的骨头，和一切的污秽。你们也是如此，在人前，外面显出公义来，里面却装满了假善和不法的事。你们有祸了，因为你们洗净杯盘的外面，里面却盛满了勒索和放荡。你这瞎眼的法利赛人，先洗净杯盘的里面，好叫外面也干净了。（马太福音23:25-28）</p>
<p>这一点从以赛亚书中的这些话也明显看出来：</p>
<p>你们这所多玛的官长啊，要听耶和华的话！你们这蛾摩拉的百姓啊，要侧耳听我们神的律法！你们所献的许多祭物与我何益呢？不要再带虚浮的供物来了；香是我所憎恶的；月朔和安息日……，我不能容忍罪孽；你们的月朔和制定的节期，我的灵魂恨恶；你们伸出手时，我必掩目不看；就是你们多多地祈祷，我也不听；你们的手都满了血。你们要洗濯、自洁，从我眼前除掉你们的恶行；要止住作恶；你们的罪虽像朱红，必变白如雪；虽红如丹颜，必白如羊毛。（以赛亚书1:10-18）</p>
<p>这些话的意思简单来说是这样：除非一个人避开邪恶，否则他的敬拜行为无一是良善，他的行为同样无一是良善；因为经上说：“我不能容忍罪孽；你们要自洁，从我眼前除掉你们的恶行；要止住作恶。”耶利米书：</p>
<p>你们各人当回头，离开恶道，改正行为。（耶利米书35:15）</p>
<p>这些人没有智慧，以赛亚书教导了这一点：</p>
<p>祸哉！那些在自己眼里有智慧，在自己面前有聪明的人！（以赛亚书5:21）</p>
<p>智慧人的智慧必然消灭；聪明人的聪明必然隐藏；祸哉！那些深藏谋略的，他们的行为是暗中行出的。（以赛亚书29:14-15）</p>
<p>祸哉！那些下埃及求帮助的，他们仰赖马匹，倚靠战车，因为它们甚多；并倚靠马兵，因为他们极强壮；却不仰望以色列的圣者，也不求问耶和华。祂要兴起攻击那作恶之家，又攻击那作孽帮助人的。埃及不过是人，并不是神，他的马不过是血肉，并不是灵。（以赛亚书31:1-3）</p>
<p>经上就是如此被描述人的自我聪明的。“埃及”表示记忆知识；“马匹”表示由此而来的理解力；“战车”表示由此而来的教义；“马兵”表示由此而来的聪明；论到这一切，经上说：“祸哉，那些不仰望以色列的圣者，也不求问耶和华的。”他们因邪恶而毁灭由这句话来表示：“祂要兴起攻击那作恶之家，又攻击那作孽帮助人的。”这些东西来自人的自我，所以它们里面没有生命，这一点由“埃及人不过是人，并不是神，他的马不过是血肉，并不是灵”来表示。“人”和“血肉”是指人的自我；“神”和“灵”是指来自主的生命；“埃及的马”是指自我聪明。圣言里有许多经文论到源于自我的聪明和源于主的聪明，它们只能通过灵义才能看出来。</p>
<p>没有人能通过他从自己所行的善事得救，因为它们不是良善，这一点从下列经文明显看出来：</p>
<p>凡称呼我主啊，主啊的人，不能都进天国；惟独遵行我天父旨意的人，才能进去。当那日，必有许多人对我说，主啊，主啊，我们不是奉你的名说预言，奉你的名赶鬼，奉你的名行许多异能吗？我必向他们声明，我从来不认识你们，你们这些作恶的人，离开我去吧！（马太福音7:21-23）</p>
<p>你们才开始站在外面叩门，说，主啊，给我们开门！你们要开始说，我们在你面前吃过、喝过，你也在我们的街上教训过人。祂却说，我告诉你们，我不晓得你们是哪里来的。你们这一切作恶的人，离开我去吧！（路加福音13:25-27）</p>
<p>因为这些人就像法利赛人，法利赛人站在圣殿祷告说，他不像别人那样是一个勒索、不义的人，是奸淫者；他一个礼拜禁食两次，凡他所得的都捐上十分之一（路加福音18:11-14）。此外，这些人就是那些被称为无用仆人的人（路加福音17:10）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 30</h4><p>30. The Word tells us in the following passage that to the extent that we are not purified from our evils, any good things we do are not good, any devout deeds are not devout, and we are not wise; but the reverse is the case if we are purified.<p>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you make yourselves like whitewashed tombs that look beautiful outwardly, but are inwardly full of dead people's bones and filth of every kind. Even so, you look righteous outwardly, but are inwardly full of hypocrisy and iniquity. Woe to you, because you cleanse the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of extortion and excess. Blind Pharisee, cleanse the inside of the cup and the plate first, so that the outside of them may be clean as well. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-28</a>)<p>Then there are these words of Isaiah:<p>Hear the word of Jehovah, you princes of Sodom! Hear the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah! What use to me are your abundant sacrifices? Do not keep bringing worthless offerings! Incense is an abomination to me, your new moons and Sabbaths. I cannot abide iniquity. My soul hates your new moons and prescribed feasts, so when you spread forth your hands I hide my eyes from you. Even though you multiply your prayers, I am not listening - your hands are full of blood. Wash yourselves! Purify yourselves! Take away the evil of your deeds from before my eyes! Stop doing evil! Even if your sins have been like scarlet, they will become white like snow; even if they have been red, they will be like wool. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_1_10.htm">Isaiah 1:10-18</a>)<p>Put briefly, this is saying that unless we turn our backs on evil deeds, none of our worship is any good. The same holds true for everything we do, since it says "I cannot abide iniquity; purify yourselves; take away the evil of your deeds; stop doing evil." In Jeremiah,<p>Turn back, all of you, from your evil way, and make your works good. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_35_15.htm">Jeremiah 35:15</a>)</p><p>[2] These people are not wise, either. See the following from Isaiah:<p>Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and intelligent in their own estimation. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>)<p>Again,<p>The wisdom of the wise will perish, as will the intelligence of the intelligent. Woe to those whose wisdom is profound and whose deeds are done in darkness. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_29_14.htm">Isaiah 29:14-15</a>)<p>And yet again,<p>Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help and who rely on horses, who trust in an abundance of chariots and in the strength of riders, but do not look to the Holy One of Israel and do not seek Jehovah. He will rise up against the house of the malicious and against the aid of those who work iniquity, because Egypt is not God, and its horses are flesh, and not spirit. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_31_1.htm">Isaiah 31:1-3</a>)<p>That is how our own intelligence is described. Egypt is mere facts; a horse is our understanding of those facts; chariots are religious teachings based on those facts; and riders are the intelligence we develop as a result. Of these qualities we read, "Woe to those who do not look to the Holy One of Israel and do not seek Jehovah." "He will rise up against the house of the malicious and against the aid of those who work iniquity" means the destruction of these qualities by evils. "Egypt is human, not God, and her horses are flesh, and not spirit" means that this understanding comes from our own sense of self-importance and that therefore there is no life in it. "Human" and "flesh" are our own sense of self, and "God" and "spirit" are life that comes from the Lord. The horses of Egypt are the intelligence that we claim as our own.<p>There are many similar passages in the Word whose focus on self-derived intelligence and intelligence that comes from the Lord can be seen only through their spiritual meaning.</p><p>[3] We can see from the following passages that none of us can be saved by means of good works done by ourselves, because they are not good.<p>Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord, " will enter the kingdom of the heavens, but those who do the will of my Father. On that day many will say to me, "Lord, Lord, haven't we prophesied in your name, cast out demons in your name, and done many great things in your name?" But then I will declare to them, "I do not know you. Depart from me, you workers of iniquity." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>)<p>And in another passage,<p>Then you begin to stand outside and knock on the door, saying, "Lord, open the door for us!" Then you will begin to say, "We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets." But he will say, "I tell you, I do not know where you are from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_25.htm">Luke 13:25-27</a>)<p>They are in fact like the Pharisee who prayed, standing in the Temple, saying that he was not greedy, unjust, or adulterous like other people, but fasted twice a week and gave tithes of all he possessed (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_18_11.htm">Luke 18:11-14</a>). They are also the ones called "worthless servants" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_17_10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 30</h4><p>30. The Word teaches that insofar as a person is not purified of his evils, the good that he does is not good, neither are his pieties pious, nor is he wise — and the converse — in this passage:<p>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness. Even so you also outwardly appear righteous..., but inside you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>)<p>Woe to you...! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of plunder and intemperance. Blind Pharisee, first cleanse the inside of the cup and dish, that the outside of them may be clean also. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>) <p>Also in this passage in Isaiah:<p>Hear the word of Jehovah, you princes of Sodom; hear the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah: “What is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me? ...Bring no more empty sacrifice; incense is an abomination to Me. The New Moon and the Sabbath...— I cannot endure iniquity.... Your New Moons and appointed feasts My soul hates.... When you spread out your hands, (therefore, ) I will hide My eyes from you; even if you make many prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood. Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes. Cease to do evil.... If your sins have been like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; if they have been red like crimson, they shall be as wool. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_1_10.htm">Isaiah 1:10-18</a>) <p>In sum this means that unless a person refrains from evils, his worship is not at all good, and so neither are his works. For the passage says, “I cannot endure iniquity.” “Make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings.” “Cease to do evil.”<p>In Jeremiah:<p>Turn now everyone from his evil way and make your works good. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_35_15.htm">Jeremiah 35:15</a>)</p><p>[2] That these people are not wise:<p>In Isaiah:<p>Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and intelligent in their own sight! (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>) <p>Again in Isaiah:<p>The wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their intelligent men.... Woe to those who are deeply wise..., and their works are done in the dark. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_29_14.htm">Isaiah 29:14-15</a>) And elsewhere in Isaiah:<p>Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses, who trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are strong, but who do not look to the Holy One of Israel, nor seek Jehovah! ...But He will arise against the house of evildoers, and against the help of those who work iniquity. For Egypt...is not God; and its horses are flesh, not spirit. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_31_1.htm">Isaiah 31:1-3</a>) Thus is described a person’s own intelligence. Egypt means knowledge. A horse is the resulting understanding. A chariot is the resulting doctrine. A horseman is the resulting intelligence. Of these the passage says, “Woe to those...who do not look to the Holy One of Israel, and do not seek Jehovah!” Their destruction by evils is meant by Jehovah’s rising up “against the house of evildoers, and against the help of those who work iniquity.”<p>That these evils spring from their inherent nature, and so have no life in them, is meant by Egypt’s being man and not God, and its horses flesh and not spirit. Man and flesh mean a person’s inherent nature. God and spirit mean life from the Lord. The horses of Egypt are a person’s own intelligence.<p>There are many such passages in the Word regarding an understanding springing from oneself and an understanding received from the Lord, passages whose meaning can be seen only by means of the spiritual sense.</p><p>[3] That no one is saved by good springing from himself, because it is not good, is apparent from the following:<p>Not everyone who says to Me, “Lord, Lord, ” shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father.... Many will say to Me in that day, “Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?” But then I will declare to them, “I do not know you; depart from Me, you workers of iniquity!” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>) <p>And elsewhere:<p>...(then) you will begin to stand outside and knock at the door, saying, “Lord, Lord, open to us, ” and...you will begin to say, “We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets.” But He will say, “I tell you I do not know you, where you are from. Depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_23_25.htm">Luke 23:25-27</a>) Such people are like the Pharisee who, standing in the Temple, prayed, saying that he was not like other people, greedy, unjust, lecherous, that he fasted twice a week and gave a tenth of all he possessed (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_18_11.htm">Luke 18:11-14</a>). They are also like the servants called useless servants (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_17_10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 30 </h4>
<p>30. The Word teaches also that, so far as a man is not purified from evils, his good deeds are not good, nor are his pious acts pious, neither is he wise; and the converse. This it teaches in the following passages:
<p>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites for ye make yourselves like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.
<p>Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous ... but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>.
<p>Woe unto you ... for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
<p>Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside may be clean also. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>.
<p>Also from these words in Isaiah:
<p>Hear the word of Jehovah, ye rulers of Sodom give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah:
<p>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?
<p>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moon and sabbath... I cannot endure the iniquity...
<p>Your new moon and your appointed feasts my soul hateth...
<p>And when ye stretch forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear your hands are full of blood. Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil...
<p>Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though they be red ... they shall be as wool. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_1_10.htm">Isaiah 1:10-11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_1_13.htm">13-18</a>.
<p>These words in brief mean, that unless a man shuns evils, none of his acts of worship, and likewise none of his works, are good; for it is said, I cannot endure the iniquity ... Make you clean, put away the evil of your doings, cease to do evil.
<p>So in Jeremiah:
<p>Return ye every man from his evil way, and amend your doings. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_35_15.htm">Jeremiah 35:15</a>.
<p> </p>
<p>[2] That such persons are not wise is taught in Isaiah:
<p>Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight! <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>.
<p>In the same:
<p>For there shall perish the wisdom of their wise men, and the understanding of their prudent.
<p>Woe unto them that are profoundly wise, and whose works are done in the dark. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_29_14.htm">Isaiah 29:14-15</a>
<p>And elsewhere in the same:
<p>Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong: but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Jehovah ...
<p>But He will arise against the house of the evil-doers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.
<p>For Egypt is not God, and his horses are flesh, and not spirit. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_31_1.htm">Isaiah 31:1-3</a>.
<p>Thus is described self-intelligence: Egypt denotes natural knowledge (scientia); the horse denotes the understanding thence derived; the chariot denotes doctrine thence derived; and the horseman denotes intelligence from the same source. Of all these it is said, Woe to them that look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Jehovah. Their destruction by evils is meant by the words, He will arise against the house of the evil-doers, and against the help of them that work iniquity. That these things are from the proprium, and consequently have no life in them, is meant by Egypt being man and not God, and his horses being flesh and not spirit. Man and flesh denote man's proprium, while God and spirit denote life from the Lord, and the horses of Egypt denote self-intelligence. There are in the Word many such passages concerning intelligence derived from oneself and that derived from the Lord, which become clear only by means of the spiritual sense.
<p> </p>
<p>[3] It is evident from the following passages that no one will be saved through the good deeds that he does from self, because they are not good:
<p>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father...
<p>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name have done many wonderful works?
<p>And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>
<p>And elsewhere:
<p>Then shall ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open unto us ...
<p>Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.
<p>But He shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are: depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_25.htm">Luke 13:25-27</a>.
<p>For such persons are like the Pharisee
<p>Who stood and prayed in the temple, saying that he was not as other men, an extortioner, unjust, an adulterer; that he fasted twice in the week, and gave tithes of all that he possessed. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_18_11.htm">Luke 18:11-14</a>;
<p>And they are also those who are called unprofitable servants. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_17_10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 30</h4><p>30. The Word teaches that in proportion as a man has not been purified from evils, his goods are not good, nor are his pious things pious, and neither is he wise: it also teaches the converse:<p>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchers, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly indeed appear righteous unto men, but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. Woe unto you, for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside thereof may become clean also (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-28</a>).<p>The same appears from these words in Isaiah:<p>Hear the word of Jehovah, ye princes of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me? bring no more a meat- offering of vanity; incense is an abomination unto Me; new moon and sabbath, I cannot bear iniquity; your new moons and your appointed feasts My soul hateth; therefore when ye spread forth your hands I will hide Mine eyes from you; yea, if ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of bloods. Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes; cease to do evil; though your sins have been as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they have been red, they shall be as wool (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_1_10.htm">Isaiah 1:10-18</a>).<p>These words in brief amount to this: that unless a man shuns evils, nothing of his worship is good, and in like manner nothing of his works, for it is said, "I cannot bear iniquity, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings, cease to do evil." In Jeremiah:<p>Return ye every man from his evil way, and make your works good (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_35_15.htm">Jeremiah 35:15</a>).</p><p>[2] That the same are not wise is declared in Isaiah:<p>Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and intelligent before their own faces (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_5_21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>).<p>The wisdom of the wise shall perish, and the intelligence of the intelligent; woe unto them that are deeply wise, and their works are done in the dark (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_29_14.htm">Isaiah 29:14-15</a>).<p>Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, and put their stay on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Jehovah. But He will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity. For Egypt is man, and not God; and the horses thereof are flesh, and not spirit (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_31_1.htm">Isaiah 31:1-3</a>).<p>Thus is described man's self-intelligence. "Egypt" is memory-knowledge; a "horse," the understanding therefrom; a "chariot," the doctrine therefrom; a "horseman," the intelligence therefrom; of all of which it is said, "Woe to them that look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Jehovah." Their destruction through evils is meant by: "He will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity." That these things are from man's Own, and that consequently there is no life in them, is meant by its being said that "Egypt is man and not God," and that "the horses thereof are flesh and not spirit." "Man" and "flesh" denote what is man's Own; "God," and "spirit," denote life from the Lord; the "horses of Egypt," denote self-intelligence. There are many such things in the Word concerning intelligence from self, and intelligence from the Lord, which can be seen only by means of the spiritual sense.</p><p>[3] That no one is saved by means of goods from self, because they are not good, is evident from the following:<p>Not everyone that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he that doeth the will of My Father: many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied by Thy name, and by Thy name cast out demons, and in Thy name done many mighty things? but then I will profess unto them, I never knew you, depart from Me, ye that work iniquity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_7_21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>).<p>Then shall ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and ye shall begin to say, We did eat and drink in Thy presence, and Thou hast taught in our streets; but He shall say, I tell you I know ye not whence ye are, depart from Me, all ye workers of iniquity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_13_25.htm">Luke 13:25-27</a>).<p>For such persons are like the Pharisee,<p>Who stood in the temple and prayed, saying that he was not as other men, an extortioner, unjust, an adulterer; that he fasted twice in the week, and gave tithes of all that he possessed (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_18_11.htm">Luke 18:11-14</a>).<p>Such persons moreover are those who are called unprofitable servants (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_17_10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 30 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>30. Verbum docet, quod quantum homo non purificatus est a malis, bona ejus non sint bona, nec pia ejus sint pia, nec sapiat, et vicissim; in his:- <p>"Vae vobis Scribae et Pharisaei, hypocritae, quia similes vos facitis sepulcris dealbatis, quae foris quidem apparent pulchra, intus vero plena sunt ossibus mortuorum et omni immunditie: sic etiam vos foris quidem apparetis... justi, intus vero pleni estis hypocrisi et iniquitate. Vae vobis,... quia purgatis exterius poculi et patinae, interiora vero plena sunt rapina et intemperantia. Pharisaee caece, purga prius interius poculi et patinae, ut fiat etiam exterius mundum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_30/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_23_25-28">Matthaeus 23:25-28</a>). <p>Tum ex his apud Esaiam, <p>"Audite verbum Jehovae, principes Sodomae; audite legem Dei nostri, popule Gomorrhae. Quid Mihi multitudo sacrificiorum vestrorum?... Ne addite adducere mincham vanitatis; suffitus abominatio Mihi est, novilunium et sabbathum,... non possum ferre iniquitatem...: novilunia... et festa stata vestra odit anima mea... Unde quando expanditis manus vestras, occulto oculos meos a vobis: etiam si multiplicatis orationem, non Ego audiens; manus vestrae sanguinibus plenae sunt. Lavate vos, purificate vos, removete malitiam operum vestrorum a coram oculis meis, cessate malum facere. ...Si fuerint peccata vestra sicut coccinea, sicut nix albescent; si rubra fuerint..., sicut lana erunt" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_30/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_1_10-18">Esaias 1:10-18</a>). <p>Haec in summa sunt, quod nisi homo fugit mala, omnia cultus ejus non bona sint, similiter omnia ejus opera; nam dicitur, "Non possum ferre iniquitatem," "purificate vos, removete malitiam operum vestrorum, cessate malum facere." Apud Jeremiam, <p>"Revertimini quisque a via sua mala, et bona reddite opera vestra" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_30/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_35_15">35:15</a>). <p>Quod iidem nec sapiant:- Apud Esaiam, <p>"Vae sapientibus in oculis suis, et coram faciebus suis intelligentibus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_30/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_5_21">Esaias 5:21</a>). <p>Apud eundem, <p>"Peribit sapientia sapientium..., ac intelligentia intelligentium: vae illis profunde sapiunt,... et fiunt in tenebris opera illorum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_30/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_29_14-15">Esaias 29:14-15</a>). <p>Et alibi apud eundem, <p>"Vae descendentibus in Aegyptum pro auxilio, et super equis innituntur, et confidunt super curru quod multus, et super equitibus quod validi sint..., sed non respiciunt ad Sanctum Israelis, et Jehovam non quaerunt. ...Sed surget contra domum malignorum, et contra auxilium operantium iniquitatem; nam Aegyptus non Deus, et equi ejus caro non spiritus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_30/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_31_1-3">Esaias 31:1-3</a>): <p>Ita describitur propria intelligentia; "Aegyptus" est scientia; "equus" est intellectus inde; "currus "est doctrina inde ; "eques" est intelligentia inde; de quibus dicitur, "Vae illis, qui non respiciunt ad Sanctum Israelis, et Jehovam non quaerunt:" destructio eorum per mala, intelligitur per "Surget contra domum malignorum, et contra auxilium operantium iniquitatem:" quod illa sint ex proprio, et ideo non in illis vita, intelligitur per quod "Aegyptus homo et non Deus," et quod "equi ejus caro et non spiritus;" "homo" et "caro" sunt proprium hominis, "Deus," et "spiritus" sunt vita a Domino, "equi Aegypti" sunt propria intelligentia. Talia sunt plura in Verbo de intelligentia a se, et de intelligentia a Domino, quae modo per sensum spiritualem patent. <p>Quod nemo salvetur per bona a se, quia non sunt bona, patet ex his:- <p>"Non omnis dicens Mihi, Domine, Domine, intrabit in regnum caelorum, sed faciens voluntatem Patris mei...: multi dicent Mihi in die illo, Domine, Domine, nonne per nomen tuum prophetavimus, et per nomen tuum daemonia ejecimus, et in nomine tuo multas virtutes fecimus? sed tunc confitebor illis, Non novi vos, discedite a Me, operantes iniquitatem" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_30/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_7_21-23">Matthaeus 7:21-23</a>). <p>Et alibi, <p>"Tunc incipietis foris stare, et pulsare januam, dicentes, Domine... aperi nobis;... et incipietis dicere, Edimus coram Te, et bibimus, et in plateis nostris docuisti: sed dicet, Dico vobis, non novi vos unde sitis, discedite a Me, omnes operarii iniquitatis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_30/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_13_25-27">Lucas 13:25-27</a>). <p>Similes enim sunt Pharisaeo, <p>Qui in Templo stans orabat, dicens quod non esset sicut reliqui homines, rapax, injustus, moechus, quod jejunaret bis in septimana, et daret decimas omnium quae possidebat (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_30/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_18_11-14">Lucas 18:11-14</a>): <p>Sunt etiam illi qui vocantur <p>"Inutiles servi" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_30/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_17_10">Lucas 17:10</a>). </p>
