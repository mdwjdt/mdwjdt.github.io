<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life112.各种的偷盗和欺诈，各种的杀人和报复，以及各种的假见证和谎言，都是这样。没有人凭自己从它们当中洁净，并变得纯洁，因为每种欲望里面都有无限事物；人只是将这些无限事物看成一个简单事物，而主却看到整个系列的最小细节。总之，一个人无法使自己重生，也就是说，在自己里面形成一个新心和一个新灵（以西结书11:19；36:26）；唯独主能做到这一切，祂本身是改造者和重生者。因此，如果一个人想要凭自己的聪明才智使自己变得焕然一新，就只会像给一张丑脸涂胭脂，或给内部感染的部位上清洁膏。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 112</h4><p>112. It is much the same with all kinds of theft and cheating, all kinds of killing and vengeance, all kinds of false witness and lying. None of us can be cleansed and purified from them by our own strength. There are infinite complexities hidden within a compulsion that we see as a single, simple thing, but the Lord sees the tiniest details in complete sequence.<p>In a word, we cannot regenerate ourselves. That is, we cannot form a new heart and a new spirit within ourselves [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_36_26.htm">36:26</a>]. Only the Lord, who is the true Reformer and Regenerator, can do this; so if we try to make ourselves new with our own plans and our own intelligence, this is like putting rouge on a disfigured face or smearing cleansing cream over an area that is inwardly infected. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 112</h4><p>112. The case is the same with every form of theft or fraud; with every form of murder and revenge; and with every form of false witness and lying. No one can be cleansed and purified of these on his own. For every urge has in it countless elements which seem to a person to constitute one simple unit, while the Lord sees each single element in their whole series.<p>In a word, a person cannot regenerate himself, that is to say, he cannot form in himself a new heart and new spirit, but only the Lord can, who is the only reformer and regenerator. Consequently, if a person tries to make himself a new person, using his own prudence and intelligence, it is merely like putting makeup on an ugly face, or like spreading cleanser over a body part inwardly infected with disease. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 112 </h4>
<p>112. The case is similar, with all kinds of theft and fraud; with all kinds of murder and revenge; and with all kinds of false witness and lies. No one can be cleansed and purified from these of himself; for in every lust there are infinite things which man does not see except as one simple entity, but the Lord sees in most particular detail the things in every series. In a word, man cannot regenerate himself, that is, form in himself a new heart and a new spirit, but the Lord alone [can effect this], who is Himself the Reformer and Regenerator. Therefore if a man seeks to make himself anew from his own prudence and intelligence, it is only like putting rouge on a deformed face and applying a superficial wash to a part affected with inward putrefaction. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 112</h4><p>112. It is the same with thefts and frauds of every kind, with murders and revengeful acts of every kind, and with false witness and lies of every kind. No one can of himself be cleansed and made pure from such things, for within every concupiscence there are infinite things which the man sees only as one simple thing, whereas the Lord sees the smallest details of the whole series. In a word, a man cannot regenerate himself, that is, form in himself a new heart and a new spirit, but the Lord alone can do this, who Himself is the Reformer and the Regenerator. Therefore if a man wills to make himself new by his own sagacity and intelligence, it is merely like painting an ugly face, or smearing a skin detergent over a part that is infected with inward corruption. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 112 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>112. Simile est cum omnis generis furtis et defraudationibus; cum omnis generis homicidiis et vindictis; et cum omnis generis falsis testimoniis et mendaciis: nemo ab illis mundari et purificari potest a se; unicuique enim concupiscentiae insunt infinita, quae homo non videt nisi sicut unum simplex, Dominus autem videt singularissima in omni serie. Verbo, homo non potest semet regenerare, hoc est, novum cor et novum spiritum in se formare, sed solus Dominus, qui est Ipse Reformator et Regenerator: quare si homo ex sua prudentia ac intelligentia vult se novum facere, est modo sicut faciei deformi inducere fucum, ac parti interiori tabe infectae illinere smegma. </p>
