<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》 第64节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Life64.所有宗教都有一个共同原则，即：人应当省察自己，悔改，停止罪恶；否则，他就会受到诅咒。这是所有宗教的一个共同特征（参看4-8节）。教导十诫在整个基督教界也是一个常见做法，小孩子通常通过这种教导而被引入基督教。这些诫命在每个小孩子的手里。他们的父母和教师会告诉他们，犯这些邪恶就是得罪神；事实上，当对孩子说这话时，他们不知道别的，头脑里也没有别的想法。我们可能会奇怪，同样是这些人，以及这些孩子长大成长后，却认为他们不在这律法之下，并且不能做这律法所要求的事。除了他们热爱邪恶，因而热爱支持这些邪恶的虚假观念外，他们学会以这种方式思考还能有其它任何原因吗？因此，他们就是那些不将十诫视为宗教事务的人。在《新耶路撒冷教义之信仰篇》我们会看到，这些人过着没有宗教信仰的生活。</p>

<h4 align="center">Life (Dole translation 2014) 64</h4><p>64. Every religion has the general principle that we are to examine ourselves, practice repentance, and refrain from sins, and if we do not do this, we suffer damnation. (See above, <a href="../life/1.htm">1-8</a>, on this being a common feature of all religion.)<p>The whole Christian world also has the common practice of teaching the Ten Commandments as a way of introducing little children to the Christian religion. These commandments are in every little child's hand. Their parents and teachers tell them that doing such things is sinning against God. In fact, when they talk with children they have no other thought in their heads but this. It is little short of amazing that these same people, and the children when they grow up, think that they are not subject to the law and that they are incapable of doing what the law requires. Can there be any reason why they learn to think like this other than that they love evils and therefore love the false notions that support them? These are the individuals, then, who do not regard the Ten Commandments as matters of religion. See Teachings on Faith on the fact that there is no religion in the lives of such people. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Rogers translation 2014) 64</h4><p>64. It is a common tenet in every religion that a person ought to examine himself, repent, and desist from his sins, and that if he does not do this, he is in a state of damnation. To be shown that this is a common tenet in every religion, see nos. <a href="../life/4.htm">4-8</a> above.<p>It is also a common practice throughout the Christian world to teach the Ten Commandments, and by this means to initiate little children into the Christian religion. For the Decalogue is in the hands of all young children. Their parents and teachers tell them that to do these forbidden things is to sin against God, and they say this even when speaking with little children, nor do the children know any different.<p>Who cannot wonder that these same people, and the little children too when they become adults, think they are not subject to the law, and that is it impossible for them to keep the things that are in the law? Can there be any other reason for their learning to think in this way than that they love evils and the consequent falsities that support them?<p>These are accordingly people who do not make the Ten Commandments commandments of religion. These same people live their lives independently of religion, as will be seen in The Doctrine Regarding Faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Dick translation 1954) 64 </h4>
<p>64. It is a common maxim in every religion that a man ought to examine himself, to do repentance, and to desist from sins; and that if he does not do so he is in a state of damnation. That this is common in every religion may be seen above, Nos. 4-8. It is also common in the whole Christian world to teach the Decalogue, and thereby to initiate children into the Christian religion; for the Decalogue is in the hands of all children and young people. Their parents and teachers tell them that to do these evils is to sin against God; indeed, while they are talking with the children, they do not know anything else. Who cannot wonder then that the same parents and teachers, and also the children when they become adults, think that they are not under the Law, and that they cannot do the things required by that Law? Can there be any other reason why they learn to think thus, than that they love evils, and consequently the falsities which favour them? These, therefore, are they who do not make the precepts of the Decalogue precepts of religion. That the same persons live without religion will be seen in THE DOCTRINE CONCERNING FAITH. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Life (Potts translation 1904) 64</h4><p>64. It is a common principle of every religion that a man ought to examine himself, repent, and desist from sins, and that if he fails to do so he is in a state of damnation. (That this is a common principle of every religion may be seen above, n. 4-8.) Teaching the Decalogue is also a common thing throughout the whole Christian world, and by it little children are commonly initiated into the Christian religion, for it is in the hands of all young children. Their parents and teachers tell them that to commit these evils is to sin against God, and in fact while speaking to the children they know nothing different. We may well wonder that these same persons, and the children too when they become adults, think that they are not under this Law, and that they are not able to do the things that belong to it. Can there be any other cause for their learning to think in this way, than that they love evils and consequently the false notions that favor them? These therefore are the people who do not make the commandments of the Decalogue a matter of religion. And that these same persons live without religion will be seen in the Doctrine of Faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 64 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>64. Commune in omni religione est, quod homo debeat explorare se, paenitentiam agere, et desistere a peccatis; et quod si non id faciat, in damnatione sit. Quod hoc sit commune in omni religione, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_64/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_4">4-8</a>). Commune etiam est in toto Christiano orbe, quod Decalogus doceatur, et quod infantes in religionem Christianam initientur per illum, est enim in omnium infantum puerorum manu. Ipsi parentes et magistri dicunt illis, quod illa facere sit peccare contra Deum; immo quando cum infantibus loquuntur, nec aliud sciunt. Quis non mirari potest, quod iidem, et quoque infantes cum adulti fiunt, cogitent quod non sub Lege illa sint; et quod facere illa, quae istius Legis sunt, non possint? Quod discant ita cogitare, num aliud potest in causa esse, quam quod ament mala, et inde falsa quae favent Hi itaque sunt, qui praecepta Decalogi non faciunt Religionis: quod iidem vivant absque religione, videbitur in Doctrina de Fide. </p>
