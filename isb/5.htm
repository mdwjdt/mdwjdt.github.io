<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵魂与身体的相互作用》 第5节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">三、灵界太阳是来自耶和华神的纯粹的爱，耶和华神就在这太阳中间</h4>
<p>ISB5.属灵事物只能从爱，不能从其它任何源头发出，爱只能从为爱本身的耶和华神发出，不能从其它任何源头发出。所以，一切属灵之物都从灵界太阳流出，如同从它们的源泉流出；这太阳是来自耶和华神的纯粹的爱，耶和华神就在它中间。这太阳本身不是神，而是来自神，是围绕祂、来自祂的最近气场。耶和华神通过这太阳创造宇宙；宇宙是指作为一个整体的所有世界，这些世界和我们浩瀚天空中的星星一样多。</p>
<p>创造通过这纯粹为爱的太阳，因而由耶和华神实现，因为爱是生命的真正存在，智慧是由此而来的生命的显现，一切事物都是从爱通过智慧创造的。这就是约翰福音中这些话的意思：</p>
<p>圣言与神同在，神就是圣言；万物是藉着祂造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的；世界也是祂造的。(约翰福音1:1, 3, 10)</p>
<p>此处“圣言”是指神性真理，因而也指神性智慧；所以此处“圣言”也被称为照亮每个人(1:9)的光，神性智慧以同样的方式通过神性真理照亮每个人。</p>
<p>那些不从藉着神性智慧的神性之爱，而是从其它任何源头推论诸世界的起源之人，就像头脑紊乱的人一样被迷惑了；他们视幽灵为人，视幻影为光，视想象的人为真实的人。因为受造宇宙是通过智慧来自爱的一个连贯作品。你若能按顺序从初至末查看事物的联系，就会发现这一点。</p>
<p>由于神为一，所以属灵太阳也为一；因为空间的延伸无法论及属灵事物，也就是属灵太阳的衍生物；没有空间的本质和存在在没有空间的空间中无处不在；因此，神性之爱从宇宙的起始处直到它的一切边界。神性充满一切事物，并通过这种充满将一切事物保存在它们被造所处的状态，理性官能远远地会看到；随着它越发知道在自己里面的爱是何性质，以及这爱为了觉察目的而与智慧的结合、为了展现原因而进入智慧的流注、为了产生结果而通过智慧的运作是何性质，它就看得越发清晰。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">5、（3）灵界的太阳是纯粹的爱，这爱是从耶和华上帝而来，祂在那太阳中。</h4>
<p>灵性的事物不能从爱以外的源头而来，爱也不能从耶和华上帝以外的源头来，因祂是爱本身。所以，一切灵性事物从灵界的太阳流出，好像从它们的泉源流出。灵界的太阳是纯粹的爱，是从耶和华上帝而来，祂在其中。太阳本身不是上帝，而是来自上帝，是离祂最近、来自于祂、环绕祂的球体，耶和华上帝藉着这太阳创造宇宙，这意味着其中包括的所有世界是统一的整体，这些世界的总数与我们浩瀚天空中的星星一样多。</p>
<p>【2】创造是耶和华上帝通过灵界太阳来实现的，这太阳是纯粹的爱，因为爱是生命的真正本质，智慧是生命的存在，一切都是从爱通过智慧创造出来的。这是《约翰福音》中的意思：</p>
<p>道（圣言）与上帝同在，上帝就是道，万物是藉着祂造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的。世界也是藉着祂造的。（1：1，3，10）。</p>
<p>“道”是神性的真理，所以也是神性的智慧；所以“道”被称为光，照亮每个人（第9节），神性的智慧以同样的方式藉由神性的真理运作。</p>
<p>【3】世界源于藉着神性智慧的神性之爱，任何将世界归于其它源头的人，就像大脑紊乱的人一样被迷惑。他们把幽灵看作人，把幻影当作光，把虚构的生物看作真实的人物。因为受造的宇宙是一个源于爱、通过智慧而成就的相互关联的作品。如果你能按照事物从最初到最后的顺序来研究它们之间的联系，你就会明白这一点。</p>
<p>【4】因为上帝是独一的，所以，灵界的太阳也是独一的，因为空间的扩展不能被用来判断源自于灵界太阳的灵性事物，本质和存在独立于空间，又在空间内外无处不在。因此神性之爱是从宇宙的开始到它所有的边界。神性充满一切，通过这充满保存万物在被造时的状态中。以理性的能力理解这些，可谓是远影模糊，但越是了解以下各点，也就会看得越清楚：爱的本质特性，它为了觉知目的而与智慧结合，它的流注进入智慧是为了展示肇因，并通过智慧的运作产生结果。</p>

<h4 align="center">Interaction of the Soul and Body (Elliott translation 2012) 5</h4><p>5. III. The sun of the spiritual world is pure love from Jehovah God, who is in the midst of it. <p>Spiritual things cannot proceed from any other source than from love, nor love from any other source than from Jehovah God, who is love itself: hence the sun of the spiritual world, from which, as from their fountain, all spiritual things stream forth, is pure love proceeding from Jehovah God, who is in the midst of it. That sun itself is not God, but is from God: it is the nearest sphere around Him from Himself. By means of this sun the universe was created by Jehovah God; by which are meant all worlds considered as one whole, which are as many as the stars in the expanse of our heaven.</p><p>[2] Creation was effected by means of that sun, which is pure love, thus by Jehovah God, because love is the very Being [esse] of life, and wisdom is the Manifestation [existere] of life from thence, and all things were created from love by means of wisdom. This is understood by these words in John: 'The Word was with God, and God was the Word. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made: and the world was made by Him' (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>) the light which enlightens every man, in like manner as does the Divine Wisdom by means of the Divine Truth.</p><p>[3] Those who deduce the origin of worlds from any other source than from the Divine Love by means of the Divine Wisdom are deluded like those mentally afflicted, who see spectres as men, phantoms as luminous objects, and imaginary beings as real figures. For the created universe is a coherent work, from love by means of wisdom: this you will see, if you are able to view the connection of things in order, from first principles to ultimates.</p><p>[4] As God is one, so also the spiritual sun is one; for extension of space is not predicable of spiritual things, which are its derivations: and essence and existence, which are without space, are everywhere in spaces without space; thus the Divine Love is everywhere from the beginning of the universe to all its boundaries. That the Divine fills all things, and by such infilling preserves them in the state in which they were created, the rational faculty sees remotely: and it sees it more nearly, in proportion as it has a knowledge of the nature of love as it is in itself; of its conjunction with wisdom that ends may be perceived, of its influx into wisdom that causes may be exhibited, and of its operation by means of wisdom that effects may be produced. </p>

THE SUN OF THE SPIRITUAL WORLD IS PURE LOVE FROM JEHOVAH GOD, WHO IS IN THE MIDST OF IT. <p>Spiritual things cannot proceed from any other source than from love, nor love from any other source than from Jehovah God, who is love itself: hence the sun of the spiritual world, from which, as from their fountain, all spiritual things stream forth, is pure love proceeding from Jehovah God, who is in the midst of it.

<h4 align="center">Interaction of the Soul and Body (Whitehead translation 1892) 5</h4><p>5. III. The sun of the spiritual world is pure love, from Jehovah God, who is in the midst of it. <p>Spiritual things cannot proceed from any other source than from love, and love cannot proceed from any other source than from Jehovah God, Who is love itself. Wherefore the sun of the spiritual world, from which all spiritual things flow forth as from their fountain, is pure love from Jehovah God, Who is in the midst of it. That sun itself is not God, but is from God, and is the nearest sphere around Him from Him. By means of this sun the universe was created by Jehovah God; by which universe are meant all worlds in the aggregate which are as many as the stars in the expanse of our heaven.</p><p>[2] That creation was effected by means of that sun, which is pure love, thus by Jehovah God, is because love is the very esse of life, and wisdom is the existere of life therefrom, and all things were created from love by wisdom.

For the created universe is a connected work, from love by wisdom. You will see this if you are able to investigate the connections of things in their order from firsts to lasts.</p><p>[4] As God is one, so also the spiritual sun is one; for the extension of space cannot be predicated of spiritual things, which are the derivations of that sun; and essence and existence without space is everywhere in spaces without space; thus the Divine love is from the beginning of the universe to all its boundaries. That the Divine fills all things, and by filling preserves all things in the state in which they were created, reason sees remotely, and closely so far as it knows the quality of love as it is in itself, with its conjunction with wisdom for the perception of ends, its influx into wisdom for the exhibition of causes; and its operation through wisdom for the production of effects. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Commercio Animae et Corporis 5 (original Latin 1769)</h4><p>5. III. Quod Sol Mundi Spiritualis sit purus Amor, a Jehovah Deo, Qui in medio ejus est. <p>Spiritualia non possunt aliunde procedere, quam ex Amore, et Amor non aliunde quam ex Jehovah Deo, Qui est Ipse Amor, quare Sol Mundi Spiritualis, ex quo omnia Spiritualia, ut a suo fonte, scaturiunt, est purus Amor a Jehovah Deo, Qui in medio ejus est, procedens: ipse ille Sol non est Deus, sed est a Deo, est proxima Sphaera circum Illum ab Illo. Per hunc Solem a Jehovah Deo creatum est Universum, per quod intelliguntur in complexu omnes Mundi, qui totidem sunt, quot in Expanso nostri Caeli sunt Stellae. Quod Creatio per illum Solem, qui est purus Amor, facta sit, ita a Jehovah Deo, est quia Amor est ipsum Esse Vitae, et Sapientia est Existere vitae inde, et ex Amore per Sapientiam omnia creata sunt; hoc intelligitur per haec apud Johannem; Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum, omnia per Ipsum facta sunt, et absque Ipso factum est nihil quod factum est; et Mundus per Ipsum factum est, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_5/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_1" target=_top>Johannem 1:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_5/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_3" target=_top>3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_5/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_10" target=_top>10</a>; Verbum ibi est Divinum Verum, ita quoque Divina Sapientia; quare etiam Verbum ibi vocatur Lux, quae illuminat omnem hominem, Vers: <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_5/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_9" target=_top>Johannem 1:9</a>, similiter ut facit Divina Sapientia per Divinum Verum. Illi qui aliunde deducunt ortum Mundorum, quam ex Divino Amore per Divinam Sapientiam, hallucinantur sicut cerebrosi, qui vident larvas ut homines, phantasmata ut luces, ac entia rationis ut effigies reales; est enim universum creatum cohaerens Opus ex Amore per Sapientiam; visurus es hoc si potis es lustrare nexus in ordine a primis ad ultima. Quemadmodum Deus est unus, ita quoque Sol spiritualis est unus, nam de spiritualibus, quae sunt ejus derivationes, non praedicabilis est extensio spatii, et Essentia et Existentia absque spatio est ubivis in spatiis absque spatio, ita Divinus Amor a principio Universi ad omnes fines ejus; quod Divinum impleat omnia, et per impletionem in statu creato conservet omnia, ratio videt e longinquo, et in propinquo quantum cognoscit Amorem qualis in se est, ejus conjunctionem cum Sapientia, ut percipiantur fines, ejus influxum in sapientiam, ut sistantur causae, et ejus operationem per sapientiam, ut producantur effectus. </p>
