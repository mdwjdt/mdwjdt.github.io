<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵魂与身体的相互作用》 第6节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">四、从那太阳发出热和光，从它发出的热本质上是爱，从它发出的光本质上是智慧</h4>
<p>ISB6.众所周知，在圣言，因而在传道者的共同语中，神性之爱用火来表达；如天上的火充满人心，点燃敬拜神的神圣渴望。原因在于，火对应于爱，因而表示爱。正因如此，耶和华神在摩西面前显现为荆棘中的火，同样于西乃山上在以色列人前面显为火；经上吩咐祭坛上要常常有火，会幕中灯台上的灯每晚都要点着。这是因为火表示爱。</p>
<p>这火含有从它发出的热，这一点从爱的效果很清楚地看出来：一个人会随着他的爱上升为激情或烈怒而被点燃、发热、燃烧。血液之热，或人和总体上的动物的生命之热，唯独从构成其生命的爱发出。地狱之火无非是与天堂之爱对立的爱。正因如此，如前所述，神性之爱在天使的世界向天使显为太阳，这太阳就像我们的太阳那样火热；并且天使照着他们对通过这太阳来自耶和华神的爱的接受而享有热。</p>
<p>由此可知，那里的光本质上是智慧；因为爱与智慧像存在与显现那样不可分割；事实上，爱通过并照着智慧存在。这就像我们的世界：春天，热与光结合，使万物发芽生长，最终结果。此外，众所周知，属灵之热是爱，属灵之光是智慧，因为一个人会随着他热爱而变得温暖，他的理解力则随着他变得智慧而处在光中。</p>
<p>我常常看见属灵之光。它在明亮和辉煌上远远超过属世之光，因为它如同明亮和辉煌本身，看上去就像明亮耀眼的雪，又像主变像时所穿的衣裳(马可福音9:3; 路加福音9:29)。由于光是智慧，所以主自称为照亮一切世人的光(约翰福音1:9)；在别处说：祂是光本身(约翰福音3:19; 8:12; 12:35, 36, 46)。也就是说，祂是神性真理本身，也就是圣言，因而是智慧本身。</p>
<p>有人以为属世之光，也就是理性之光，是从我们世界的光发出的，但其实是从灵界太阳的光发出的；因为心智的视觉流入肉眼的视觉，因而灵界的光流入自然界的光，而不是反过来。如果相反的情形发生，就会有物质流注，而不是属灵流注。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">6、（4）灵界太阳发出热和光，发出的热在本质上是爱，发出的光在本质上是智慧。</h4>
<p>众所周知，在圣经中、因而在传道者的共同言语中，神性之爱是用火来表达的，例如天堂的火充满心中，激起敬拜上帝的神圣欲望，原因是火与爱相对应，它象征着爱。因此，耶和华上帝在摩西面前、在西乃山下以色列子民面前，都被视为荆棘中的火；又有吩咐，祭坛上要一直有火，会幕灯台上的灯每晚要亮着，因为火象征爱。</p>
<p>【2】从爱的效果可清楚地看出有热来自于火。当人被激动、变热、发火，正如他的爱被提升成热情，或处于激愤中。血液的热度，或人和一般动物的生命热度，除了来自于爱，没有别的来源，爱构成它们的生命。地狱之火无非就是与天堂之爱相反的爱。因此，这就是为何在天使的世界里神性之爱在他们面前显为太阳，如同我们的太阳一样炽热，正如上面所说的，而且，天使们照着自身接受耶和华上帝的爱（这爱通过那太阳发出）的情形而处在相应的热中。</p>
<p>【3】由此可知，那里的光本质上是智慧，因为爱和智慧是不可分割的，就像本质和存在一样，爱藉着智慧并按照智慧而存在。这很像我们的世界，在春天，热与光结合在一起，让植物萌芽生长并最终结果。此外，每个人都知道灵性的热是爱，灵性的光是智慧，人因热爱而变得温暖，他的认知根据他智慧的状态而处在光中。</p>
<p>【4】我经常看到那灵性的光芒，在亮度和光彩上都极大的超过了自然之光，因为它们自身如此明亮壮丽，像明亮耀眼的雪，又好像主变像时所穿的衣服（马可福音9：3；路加福音9：29）。因为光是智慧，所以主称自己为：</p>
<p>照亮每个人的光（约翰福音1：9）。</p>
<p>在其它地方祂说：</p>
<p>祂就是光本身（约翰福音3：19；8：12；12：35，36，46）。也就是说，祂是神性真理本身，就是道（圣言），也就是智慧本身。</p>
<p>【5】人们相信，自然之光，也就是理性之光，是来自我们世界的光，但它是来自灵界太阳的光，因为心智的视线流入眼睛的视线，也就是灵界的光进入自然的光，而不是相反。如果发生相反的情况，就会有物质的流注而不是灵性的流注。</p>

<h4 align="center">Interaction of the Soul and Body (Elliott translation 2012) 6</h4><p>6. IV. From that sun proceed heat and light; the heat proceeding from it is in its essence love, and the light from it is in its essence wisdom. <p>It is well known that in the Word, and thence in the common language of preachers, the Divine Love is expressed by fire; as when prayer is offered that heavenly fire may fill the heart, and kindle holy desires to worship God: the reason is that fire corresponds to love, and thence signifies it. Hence it is that Jehovah God appeared before Moses as a fire in the bush, and in like manner before the children of Israel on Mount Sinai; and that it was commanded for fire to be kept perpetually upon the altar, and for the lights of the lamp-stand in the tabernacle to be lighted every evening: these commands were given because fire signified love.</p><p>[2] That such fire has heat proceeding from it appears plainly from the effects of love: thus a man is set on fire, grows warm, and becomes inflamed, as his love is exalted into zeal, or into the glow of anger. The heat of the blood, or the vital heat of men and of animals in general, proceeds solely from love, which constitutes their life. Neither is infernal fire anything else than love opposed to heavenly love. Thence it is, as was stated above, that the Divine Love appears to the angels in their world as the sun, fiery, like our sun; and that the angels enjoy heat according to their reception of love from Jehovah God by means of that sun.</p><p>[3] It follows from this that the light there is in its essence wisdom; for love and wisdom, like Being [else] and Manifestation [existere], are indivisible, since love is manifested by means of wisdom and according to it. This is as it is in our world: at the time of spring heat unites itself with light, and causes germination, and at length fruit. Moreover, everyone knows that spiritual heat is love and spiritual light is wisdom; for a man grows warm as he loves, and his understanding is in light as he becomes wise.</p><p>[4] I have often seen that spiritual light. It immensely exceeds natural light in brightness and splendour, for it is as brightness and splendour in their very essence: it appears like resplendent and dazzling snow, such as the garments of the Lord appeared when He was transfigured (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_29.htm">Luke 9:29</a>). As light is wisdom, therefore the Lord calls Himself the light which enlightens every man (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_19.htm">John 3:19</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_35.htm">12:35-36</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>); that is, that He is the Divine Truth itself, which is the Word, thus Wisdom itself.</p><p>[5] It is believed that natural light [lumen], which also is rational, proceeds from the light of our world: but it proceeds from the light of the sun of the spiritual world; for the sight of the mind flows into the sight of the eye, thus also the light of the spiritual world into the light of the natural world, but not the other way round: were it otherwise, there would be physical and not spiritual influx. </p>
<h4 align="center">Interaction of the Soul and Body (Hartley translation 1924) 6</h4><p>6. IV. FROM THAT SUN PROCEED HEAT AND LIGHT; THE HEAT PROCEEDING FROM IT IS IN ITS ESSENCE LOVE, AND THE LIGHT FROM IT IS IN ITS ESSENCE WISDOM. <p>It is well known that in the Word, and thence in the common language of preachers, the Divine Love is expressed by fire; as when prayer is offered that heavenly fire may fill the heart, and kindle holy desires to worship God: the reason is that fire corresponds to love, and thence signifies it.

This is as it is in our world: at the time of spring heat unites itself with light, and causes germination, and at length fruit. Moreover, every one knows that spiritual heat is love and spiritual light is wisdom; for a man grows warm as he loves, and his understanding is in light as he becomes wise.</p><p>[4] I have often seen that spiritual light. It immensely exceeds natural light in brightness and splendour, for it is as brightness and splendour in their very essence: it appears like resplendent and dazzling snow, such as the garments of the Lord appeared when He was transfigured (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_29.htm">Luke 9:29</a>).

<h4 align="center">Interaction of the Soul and Body (Whitehead translation 1892) 6</h4><p>6. IV. From that sun proceed heat and light, and the heat proceeding from it is in its essence love, and the light thence is in its essence wisdom. <p>It is known that in the Word, and thence in the common language of preachers, the Divine love is expressed by fire, as that heavenly fire fills the heart and kindles holy desires to worship God. The reason is because fire corresponds to love, and therefore signifies it. From this it is that Jehovah God was seen as fire in the bush before Moses, and in like manner on Mount Sinai before the sons of Israel; and that it was commanded that fire should be perpetually kept upon the altar, and that the lights of the lamp stand in the tabernacle should be lighted every evening. This was because fire signified love.</p><p>[2] That there is heat from that fire is clearly evident from the effects of love; for a man is kindled, grows warm, and is inflamed, as his love is exalted into zeal, or into the wrath of anger. The heat of the blood, or the vital heat of men, and of animals in general, is from no other source than from the love, which constitutes their life. Nor is infernal fire anything else than love opposite to heavenly love. This then is the reason that the Divine love appears to the angels as the sun in their world, fiery like our sun, as was said above, and that the angels are in heat according to their reception of love from Jehovah God through that sun.</p><p>[3] It follows from this that the light there is in its essence wisdom; for love and wisdom are indivisible, like esse and existere, for love exists through wisdom and according to it. This is very much as it is in our world, in that, in the time of spring, heat unites itself with light, and produces germinations and at length fructifications. Furthermore, everyone knows that spiritual heat is love, and spiritual light is wisdom, for a man grows warm according as he loves, and his understanding is in light according as he is wise.</p><p>[4] I have often seen that spiritual light. It immensely exceeds natural light in brightness and also in splendor, for it is as brightness and splendor themselves, and appears like bright and dazzling snow, as the garments of the Lord appeared when He was transfigured (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_29.htm">Luke 9:29</a>). Since light is wisdom, therefore the Lord calls Himself: <p>The Light which enlightens every man (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_19.htm">John 3:19</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_35.htm">12:35, 36</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>). <p>That is, that He is the Divine truth itself, which is the Word, thus wisdom itself.</p><p>[5] It is believed that natural light which is also rational light, is from the light of our world; but it is from the light of the sun of the spiritual world; for the sight of the mind flows into the sight of the eye, thus also the lights, and not the reverse. If the reverse took place, there would be physical influx and not spiritual influx. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Commercio Animae et Corporis 6 (original Latin 1769)</h4><p>6. IV. Quod ex illo Sole procedat Calor et Lux, at quod Calor ex illo procedens in essentia sua sit amor, et quod Lux inde in essentia sua sit sapientia. <p>Notum est, quod in Verbo, et inde in communi Praedicatorum sermone, Divinus Amor exprimatur per Ignem, ut quod Ignis caelestis impleat corda, et accendat sancta desideria ad colendum Deum; causa est, quia Ignis correspondet amori, et inde significat eum; ex eo est quod Jehovah Deus visus sit ut Ignis in rubo coram Mose, similiter super Monte Sinai coram Filiis Israelis, et quod mandatum sit, quod Ignis perpetuo custodiretur super Altari, et quod quavis vespera accenderentur lucernae Candelabri in Tabernaculo; hoc erat, quia ignis significabat amorem. Quod sit Calor ex illo igne, patet manifeste ex amoris effectibus, quod homo incendatur, incalescat, et inflammetur, sicut amor ejus exaltatur in zelum, aut in excandescantiam irae; Calor sanguinis, seu Calor vitalis hominum, et in genere Animalium, non aliunde est quam ex Amore, qui facit vitam illorum: Ignis infernalis nec aliud est quam Amor oppositus amori Caelesti: inde nunc est, quod Amor Divinus appareat Angelis ut Sol in Mundo illorum, igneus, ut noster Sol, ut supra dictum est, et quod Angeli in calore sint secundum receptionem Amoris a Jehovah Deo per illum Solem. Quod Lux ibi in sua essentia sit Sapientia, inde fluit, sunt enim Amor et Sapientia individui, sicut Esse et Existere, Amor enim per Sapientiam, et secundum illam existit; hoc simile est sicut in Mundo nostro, quod Calor tempore veris, uniat se cum Luce, et producat germinationes et tandem fructificationes: praeterea quisque scit, quod Calor spiritualis sit Amor, et Lux spiritualis sit sapientia; calet enim homo sicut amat, ac intellectus ejus in luce est sicut sapit. Lucem illam spiritualem saepius vidi, excedit lucem naturalem candore et quoque splendore in immensum, est enim sicut ipse candor et ipse splendor in se, apparet ut splendens et fulgurans nix, qualia visa sunt vestimenta Domini cum transformatus est, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_9_3" target=_top>Marcus 9:3</a>. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_9_29" target=_top>Lucam 9:29</a>: quoniam Lux est Sapientia, ideo Dominus se vocat Lucem, quae illuminat omnem hominem, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_9" target=_top>Johannem 1:9</a>, et alibi, quod sit ipsa Lux, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_3_19" target=_top>Johannem 3:19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_8_12" target=_top>8:12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_35-36" target=_top>12:35-36</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_46" target=_top>46</a>, hoc est, quod sit ipsum Divinum Verum, quod est Verbum, ita ipsa Sapientia. Creditur quod Lumen naturale, quod etiam est rationale, sit ex luce nostri Mundi, sed est ex luce Solis Mundi spiritualis, nam visus mentis influit in visum oculi, ita quoque luces, et non vicissim; si vicissim, foret influxus physicus, et non Influxus spiritualis. </p>
