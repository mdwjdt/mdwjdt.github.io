<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵魂与身体的相互作用》 第10节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">八、因此，从这太阳发出的一切就本身而言，都是死的</h4>
<p>ISB10.如果理解力的理性官能稍微升到身体感官事物之上，谁都能凭它看出，爱就本身而言，是活的；爱之火的表现就是生命；相反，初级的火就本身而言，分别是死的；因此，灵界的太阳因纯粹是爱，故是活的，自然界的太阳因纯粹是火，故是死的；从它们发出并存在的一切事物都是如此。</p>
<p>有两样事物产生宇宙中的一切结果，即生命和自然；当生命从里面驱动自然时，两者就按秩序产生这些结果。当自然从里面使生命行动时，情况就不同了；这种情形就发生在那些将本身是死的自然置于生命之上和之内，因而只追求感官愉悦和肉体欲望，毫不在乎灵魂的属灵事物和心智的真正理性事物的人身上。这些人由于这种颠倒而被称为“死从”；他们都是世上的无神论自然主义者，并且都是地狱里的撒旦。</p>
<p>他们在圣言中也被称为“死人”，如在诗篇：</p>
<p>他们又与巴力毗珥连合，且吃了死人的祭物。(诗篇106:28)</p>
<p>仇敌逼迫我的灵魂，使我坐在黑暗之处，像世上的死人一样。(诗篇143:3)</p>
<p>要垂听被囚之人的叹息，要释放将死的人。(诗篇102:20)</p>
<p>在启示录：</p>
<p>我知道你的行为，按名你是活的，其实是死的。你要警醒！坚固那剩下将近死去的。(启示录3:1, 2)</p>
<p>他们被称为“死人”，是因为属灵的死亡就是诅咒，诅咒就是那些相信生命来自大自然，因而相信自然之光就是生命之光，从而隐藏、窒息并扑灭关于神、天堂和永生的一切观念之人的命运。这些人就像猫头鹰，在黑暗中看见光明，在光明中看见黑暗，也就是视虚假为真理，视邪恶为良善；由于邪恶的快乐是他们的心之快乐，所以他们与那些吞吃死尸如美味，闻坟墓里的恶臭如香气的飞鸟和野兽没什么两样。这些人只看见物质或属世的流注；即便他们肯定流注是属灵的，这种肯定也只是来自教师之口，而非来自对它的任何观念。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">10、（8）因此，从尘世的太阳产生的一切，包括它自己，是死的。</h4>
<p>如果人认知的理性从身体感官之事上稍微提高一点点，谁都能看到爱本身是活的，爱之火的显现就是生命。相反，基本的火本身是死的。因此，灵界的太阳，因为它是纯洁的爱，是活的；尘世的太阳，因为它是纯粹的火，是死的。一切从这两个太阳产生和存在的事物也是如此。</p>
<p>【2】宇宙中两样东西产生一切结果，生命和自然，当内在的生命驱动自然时，一切的结果就有序产生了；另一种情形是自然从内在使生命行动，这发生在那些将本身是死的自然置于生命之上和之内的人身上，因此，他们只追求感官的愉悦和肉体的欲望，无视灵魂的灵性事物和心智的真正理性之事。因为这种颠倒，这些人被称为“死人”，都是世界上的无神论自然主义者、地狱里的撒旦。</p>
<p>【3】他们在《圣经》中也被称为“死人”，如大卫所说：</p>
<p>他们与巴力毗珥连合，吃了死人的祭物（诗106：28）。仇敌逼迫我的灵魂，使我坐在黑暗中，好像世上的死人一样（诗143：3）。听见被绑之人的呻吟，向死亡之子敞开心扉（诗102：20）。</p>
<p>在启示录中：我知道你的行为，按名你是活的，其实是死的。你要警醒，建立那些剩下的、准备要死的（3：1，2）。</p>
<p>【4】他们被称为“死人”，因为灵性的死亡是受诅咒下地狱，这是他们的命运。他们相信生命来自自然，因此自然之光是生命之光，从而隐藏、窒息和熄灭上帝、天堂和永生的每一个想法。这些人就像猫头鹰，在黑暗中看见光明，在光明中看见黑暗，也就是说，视虚假为真理、邪恶是良善；以邪恶的愉悦为他们心中之乐，所以他们如同那些鸟和野兽，把死人的尸体当美味吃，把坟墓里恶臭当作香膏。这些人也看不到自然物质以外的任何其他流注，即使他们证实流注是灵性的，也不是从它的观念中流入的，而是来自师者的教导。</p>

<h4 align="center">Interaction of the Soul and Body (Elliott translation 2012) 10</h4><p>10. VIII. Therefore everything which proceeds from this sun, regarded in itself, is dead. <p>Who does not see from the rational faculty belonging to his understanding, if this be a little elevated above the things of the bodily senses, that love, regarded in itself, is alive, and that the appearance of its fire is life; and, on the contrary, that elementary fire, regarded in itself, is respectively dead; consequently, that the sun of the spiritual world, being pure love, is alive, and that the sun of the natural world, being pure fire, is dead; and that the case is the same with all the products which proceed and exist from them?</p><p>[2] There are two things which produce all the effects in the universe, life and nature; and they produce them according to order, when life, from within, actuates nature. The case is otherwise when nature, from within, causes life to act, which occurs with those who place nature, which in itself is dead, above and within life, and thence wholly devote themselves to the pleasures of the senses and the lusts of the flesh, esteeming the spiritual things of the soul, and the truly rational things of the mind, as nothing. These persons, on account of this inversion, are those who are called the dead: such are all atheistic materialists in the world, and all the satans in hell.</p><p>[3] They are also called the dead in the Word; as in David: 'They joined themselves also unto Baal-Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead' (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_143_3.htm">Psalm 143:3</a>). 'To hear the groaning of the prisoner, and to set at liberty the sons of death' (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_1.htm">3:1-2</a>).</p><p>[4] They are called the dead, because spiritual death is condemnation; and condemnation is the lot of those who believe life to be from nature, and thus believe the light of nature to be the light of life, and thereby conceal, suffocate, and extinguish every idea of God, of heaven, and of eternal life. In consequence of so doing, such persons are like owls, which see light in darkness, and darkness in light, that is, they see falsities as truths, and evils as goods, and, as the delights of evil are the delights of their hearts, they are not unlike those birds and beasts which devour dead bodies as choice delicacies, and scent the stenches arising from graves as balsamic odours. They also see no influx but such as is physical or natural; if, notwithstanding, they affirm influx to be spiritual, it is not from any idea of it, but from the mouth of their instructor. </p>
<h4 align="center">Interaction of the Soul and Body (Hartley translation 1924) 10</h4><p>10. VIII. THEREFORE EVERYTHING WHICH PROCEEDS FROM THIS SUN, REGARDED IN ITSELF, IS DEAD. <p>Who does not see from the rational faculty belonging to his understanding, if this be a little elevated above the things of the bodily senses, that love, regarded in itself, is alive, and that the appearance of its fire is life; and, on the contrary, that elementary fire, regarded in itself, is respectively dead; consequently, that the sun of the spiritual world, being pure love, is alive, and that the sun of the natural world, being pure fire, is dead; and that the case is the same with all the products which proceed and exist from them?</p><p>[2] There are two things which produce all the effects in the universe, LIFE and NATURE; and they produce them according to order, when life, from within, actuates nature. The case is otherwise when nature, from within, causes life to act, which occurs with those who place nature, which in itself is dead, above and within life, and thence wholly devote themselves to the pleasures of the senses and the lusts of the flesh, esteeming the spiritual things of the soul, and the truly rational things of the mind, as nothing. These persons, on account of this inversion, are those who are called THE DEAD: such are all atheistic materialists in the world, and all the satans in hell.</p><p>[3] They are also called the dead in the Word; as in David: "They joined themselves also unto Baal-Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_143_3.htm">Psalm 143:3</a>).

<h4 align="center">Interaction of the Soul and Body (Whitehead translation 1892) 10</h4><p>10. VIII. Therefore everything which proceeds from this sun, regarded in itself, is dead. <p>Who does not see from the reason of his understanding, if this is a little elevated above the sensual things of the body, that love regarded in itself is alive, and that the appearance of its fire is life, and, on the contrary, that elementary fire regarded in itself is respectively dead; consequently, that the sun of the spiritual world, because it is pure love, is alive: and that the sun of the natural world, because it is pure fire, is dead; and similarly all things which proceed and exist from them?</p><p>[2] There are two things which produce all the effects in the universe, Life and Nature, and they produce them according to order when life from within actuates nature. It is otherwise when nature from within brings life to act, which takes place with those who place nature, which in itself is dead, above and within life, and thence who strive solely after the pleasures of the senses and the lusts of the flesh, and care nothing for the spiritual things of the soul and the truly rational things of the mind. Such persons, on account of that inversion, are they who are called "the dead"; such are all atheistic naturalists in the world, and all satans in hell.</p><p>[3] They are also called "the dead" in the Word, as in David: <p>They joined themselves to Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_143_3.htm">Psalms 143:3</a>). <p>To hear the groaning of the bound, and to open to the sons of death (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_1.htm">3:1, 2</a>).</p><p>[4] They are called "the dead," because spiritual death is damnation, and damnation is the lot of those who believe that life is from nature, and thus that the light of nature is the light of life, and thereby hide, suffocate, and extinguish every idea of God, of heaven, and of eternal life. Such persons are like owls, which see light in darkness and darkness in light, that is, falsities as truths and evils as goods; and because the delights of evil are the delights of their hearts, they are not unlike those birds and beasts which devour the bodies of the dead as dainties, and perceive the fetid odors from sepulchers as balsams. Such persons also do not see any other influx than physical or natural; if notwithstanding they affirm influx to be spiritual, this is not done from any idea of it but from the mouth of a teacher. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Commercio Animae et Corporis 10 (original Latin 1769)</h4><p>10. VIII. Quod inde omne quod ex hoc Sole procedit, in se spectatum sit mortuum. <p>Quis non ex ratione intellectus, si hic paulum elevatur supra sensualia corporis, videt, quod Amor in se spectatus sit vivus, et quod apparentia ignis ejus sit vita, et vicissim quod ignis elementaris in se spectatus, respective sit mortuus; consequenter quod Sol mundi Spiritualis, quia est purus Amor, sit vivus, et quod Sol Mundi naturalis, quia est purus ignis, sit mortuus; similiter omnia quae procedunt et existunt ex illis. Sunt duo, quae efficiunt omnes effectus in Universo, Vita et Natura, et efficiunt illos secundum ordinem, dum Vita ab interiori actuat naturam: aliter dum Natura ab interiori adducit vitam ad agendum, quod fit apud illos, qui ponunt naturam quae in se est mortua, supra et intra vitam, et inde unice litant voluptatibus sensuum et concupiscentiis carnis, et nihili pendunt spiritualia animae et vere rationalia mentis; hi propter inversionem illam sunt qui vocantur Mortui; tales sunt omnes Naturalistae athei in Mundo, et omnes Satanae in Inferno; nuncupantur etiam Mortui in Verbo, ut apud Davidem Adhaeserunt Baalpeori, et comederunt sacrificia Mortuorum," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_10/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_106_28" target=_top>Psalm 106:28</a>. "Persequitur hostis animam meam, sedere me facit in tenebris sicut Mortuos mundi," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_10/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_143_3" target=_top>Psalm 143:3</a>. "Ad audiendum gemitum vincti, et ad aperiendum Filiis Mortis," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_10/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_102_21" target=_top>Psalm 102:21</a>, et in Apocalypsi "Novi opera tua quod nomen habeas quod vivas, sed Mortuus es; esto vigilans et stabili reliqua qua Moribunda sunt," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_10/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_3_1-2" target=_top>Psalm 3:1-2</a>; dicuntur Mortui, quia Mors spiritualis est damnatio, et damnatio est illis, qui credunt Vitam esse ex natura, et sic lucem hujus esse lucem Vitae, et per id abscondunt, suffocant, et exstinguunt omnem ideam de Deo, deque Caelo, et de Vita aeterna; hi inde sunt sicut Noctuae, quae vident lucem in tenebris et tenebras in luce, hoc est, falsa ut vera, ac mala ut bona; et quia jucunda mali illis sunt jucunda cordis, non dissimiles sunt illis Avibus et Bestiis, quae vescuntur corporibus mortuorum ut cupediis, ac sentiunt foetores ex sepulchris ut balsama. Hi quoque non vident alium Influxum quam physicum seu naturalem; si usque affirmant Influxum spiritualem, fit hoc non ex aliqua idea ejus, sed ex ore Praeceptoris. </p>
