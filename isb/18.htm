<h3 align="center" class="ired">《灵魂与身体的相互作用》 第18节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">十六、由此明显可知，属灵流注从其源头到结果是何性质</h4>
<p>ISB18.迄今为止，属灵流注都是从灵魂进入身体，而不是从神进入灵魂，由此进入身体推断出来的。之所以如此推断，是因为没有人知道灵界和那里的太阳，而一切属灵事物都源于这太阳，如同源于自己的源泉；从而也没有人知道属灵事物进入属世事物的流注。</p>
<p>现在，我因被恩准同时在灵界和自然界，因而得以看见两个世界和两个太阳，故出于我的良心有义务传达这些事。因为知道的东西若不传达给其他人，知道又有什么用呢？岂不像是搜集财富，把它们储藏在棺材里，只是偶尔看一看，数一数，却不想着拿出来使用吗？属灵的贪婪不是别的。</p>
<p>但为叫人们充分了解何为属灵流注及其性质，有必要知道属灵之物本质上是什么，属世之物本质上又是什么，以及人类灵魂是什么。因此，为免得这部短著因对这些主题的无知而存在瑕疵，查阅穿插在《婚姻之爱》一书中的一些记事是很重要的，如：涉及属灵之物的记事(326–329节)；涉及人类灵魂的记事(315节)；涉及属灵事物进入属世事物的流注(380节)；还有更详细的(415–422节)。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">18、（16）这些事情显明了灵性流注从起源到结果的性质</h4>
<p>迄今为止，灵性流注被推断是从灵魂进入肉体的，但不是从上帝进入灵魂并由此进入肉体的。人们之所以这样认为，是因为没有人知道灵界的事，也不知道那里的太阳，一切灵性事物都是从这太阳流出，好像从泉源流出来一样。人们也因此对灵性流入物质的流注一无所知。</p>
<p>【2】现在，因我蒙允许同时在灵界和尘世，所以看到两个世界和两个太阳，我的良知让我义不容辞地表明这些事。除非一个人所知道的也为别人所知，否则就毫无用处，那就像是收集财富储存在棺材里，偶尔看一眼、细数一番，却没有一点使用它们的想法，就是灵性的贪婪。</p>
<p>【3】但要充分地了解什么是灵性流注和它的特性，就必须从本质上了解什么是灵性、什么是物质以及什么是人的灵魂。因此，为了避免本篇短文对这些事物论述的不足，参阅《婚姻之爱》（Conjugial Love）中的相关章节非常重要：关于灵性（326-329节）；关于人的灵魂（315节）；关于灵性事物的流注流入自然的事物（380节）；更充分论述如415-422节。（《真实的基督教》一书中重述了相关内容，如：280, 697, 35, 77 和12节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Interaction of the Soul and Body (Elliott translation 2012) 18</h4><p>18. XVI. Hence it is evident what is the nature of spiritual influx from its origin to its effects. <p>Spiritual influx has hitherto been deduced from the soul into the body, but not from God into the soul and thus into the body. This has been done because no one had any knowledge concerning the spiritual world and the sun there from which all spiritual things stream forth as from their fountain: and thus no one had any knowledge concerning the influx of spiritual things into natural.</p><p>[2] Now, since it has been granted me to be in the spiritual world and in the natural world at the same time, and thus to see each world and each sun, I am obliged by my conscience to communicate these things. For of what use is knowledge unless it be communicated? What is it, but like collecting and storing up riches in a casket, and only looking at them occasionally and counting them over, without any intention of applying them to use? Spiritual avarice is nothing else.</p><p>[3] But in order that it may be fully known what spiritual influx is, and what is its nature, it is necessary to know what that which is spiritual is in its essence, and what that which is natural; and also what the human soul is: lest, therefore, this short treatise should be defective through ignorance of these subjects, it will be useful to consult some memorable relations inserted in the work on Conjugial Love: concerning what is spiritual, in the memorable relation there, <a href="../cl/326.htm">326-329</a>; concerning the human soul, <a href="../cl/315.htm">315</a>; and concerning the influx of spiritual things into natural, at <a href="../cl/380.htm">380</a>; and more fully at <a href="../cl/415.htm">415-422</a>. <sup id="fn47_1">1</a></sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The same articles may be found in <a href="../tcr/280.htm">The True Christian Religion 280</a>, <a href="../tcr/697.htm">697</a>, <a href="../tcr/35.htm">35</a>, <a href="../tcr/77.htm">77</a>, <a href="../tcr/12.htm">12</a>. </p><p>

<h4 align="center">Interaction of the Soul and Body (Whitehead translation 1892) 18</h4><p>18. XVI. From these things it is evident what is the quality of spiritual influx from its origin to its effects. <p>Spiritual influx has hitherto been deduced from the soul into the body, but not from God into the soul and thus into the body. This has been done, because no one knew anything concerning the spiritual world, and concerning the sun there, from which all spiritual things flow as from their fountain, and thus nothing concerning the influx of spiritual things into natural things.</p><p>[2] Now because it has been granted me to be in the spiritual world and in the natural world at the same time, and thus to see each world and each sun, I am obliged by my conscience to manifest these things; for what is the use of knowing, unless what is known to one be also known to others? Without this, what is knowing but collecting and storing up riches in a casket, and only looking at them occasionally and counting them over, without any thought of use from them? Spiritual avarice is nothing else.</p><p>[3] But that it may be fully known what and of what quality spiritual influx is, it is necessary to know what the spiritual is in its essence, and what the natural is, and also what the human soul is. <p>Lest therefore this short treatise should be defective through ignorance of these things, it is important to consult some Relations inserted in the work on Conjugial Love; concerning the spiritual, in the Relation there (<a href="../cl/326.htm">326-329</a>); concerning the human soul (<a href="../cl/315.htm">315</a>); and concerning the influx of spiritual things into natural things (<a href="../cl/380.htm">380</a>); and more fully (<a href="../cl/415.htm">415-422</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">De Commercio Animae et Corporis 18 (original Latin 1769)</h4><p>18. XVI. Quod ex his pateat, qualis est Influxus spiritualis ab origine sua ad effectus. <p>Influxus spiritualis hactenus deductus est ab anima in corpus, non autem a Deo in animam, et sic in corpus; hoc factum est, quia nemo aliquid sciverat de Mundo spirituali, et de Sole ibi, ex quo omnia Spiritualia ut ex suo fonte scaturiunt, et sic nihil de Influxu spiritualium in naturalia. Nunc quia mihi datum est simul esse in Mundo spirituali et in Mundo naturali, et sic utrumque Mundum et utrumque Solem videre, obligor a conscientia mea manifestare illa; nam quid juvat scire, nisi id quod quis scit etiam sciat alter, quid sine hoc illud, nisi quam colligere et in scrinio recondere opes, et solum per vices tueri et numerare illas absque ulla intentione usus ex illis; avaritia spiritualis non aliud est. Sed ut plene Sciatur, quid et qualis est Influxus spiritualis, necessum est scire, quid in sua essentia est Spirituale, et quid Naturale, tum etiam quid Anima Humana; ne itaque lucubratiuncula haec propter ignorantiam illorum manca sit, interest ut consulantur aliqua Memorabilia inserta Operi de Amore Conjugiali, de Spirituali in Memorabili ibi, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_18/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_326" target=_top>326-329</a>; de Anima Humana, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_18/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_315" target=_top>315</a>; et de Influxu Spiritualium In Naturalia, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_18/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_380" target=_top>380</a>, et amplius <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-commercio-animae-et-corporis_18/swedenborg_de-amore-conjugiali_415" target=_top>415-422</a>. </p>
