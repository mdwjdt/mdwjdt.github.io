<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">五、热和光两者都流入人：热流入他的意愿，在那里产生爱之良善；光流入他的理解力，在那里产生智慧之真理</h4>
<p>ISB7.众所周知，一切事物都普遍与良善和真理有关，没有一个事物里面不存在与这两者有关的某种东西。正因如此，人里面有两种接受生命的容器：一个是接受良善的容器，被称为意愿；一个是接受真理的容器，被称为理解力；正如良善属于爱，真理属于智慧，意愿是接受爱的容器，理解力是接受智慧的容器。良善属于爱，是因为一个人所爱的，他就会去意愿，当付诸行动时，他便称之为良善；真理属于智慧，是因为一切智慧皆来自真理；事实上，一个智慧人所思想的良善就是真理，当他意愿并实行这真理时，它就变成良善。</p>
<p>人若不正确区分这两种生命容器，就是意愿和理解力，并且对它们没有形成一个清晰的概念，试图了解属灵流注是徒劳的。因为既有进入意愿的流注，也有进入理解力的流注；既有爱之良善进入人之意愿的流注，也有智慧之真理进入人之理解力的流注，它们两者都直接通过耶和华神在其中间的太阳，间接通过天使天堂而从耶和华神发出。这两种容器，即意愿和理解力，就像热和光那样不同；因为意愿接受天堂之热，这热本质上是爱，理解力接受天堂之光，这光本质上是智慧，如前所述。</p>
<p>既有一种从人的心智进入言语的流注，也有一种进入行为的流注；进入言语的流注从意愿经由理解力而来，而进入行为的流注从理解力经由意愿而来。那些只知道进入理解力的流注，同时不知道进入意愿的流注，由此进行推理并得出结论的人，就像独眼人，只看见这一边的物体，同时却看不见另一边的物体；也像残疾人，仅用一只手笨拙地工作；又像跛脚的人，拄着拐杖单脚蹒跚而行。从这些事清楚可知，属灵之热流入人的意愿，产生爱之良善；属灵之光流入他的理解力，产生智慧之真理。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">7、（5）那热和光都流入人里面，热流入人的意志（will），在此产生爱的良善；光流入人的认知（understanding），在此产生智慧的真理。</h4>
<p>众所周知，万物都普遍地与良善和真理有关，没有一物不存在与良善和真理有关的东西。由此可知，人里面有两个接受生命的容器，一个是良善的接受器，称为意志；另一个是真理的接受器，称为认知；正如良善是爱的良善、真理是智慧的真理一样，意志是爱的容器，认知是智慧的容器。良善是爱的良善，因为一个人所爱的，就是他所愿的，当他这样做的时候，他称之为善；真理是智慧的真理，因为一切智慧皆出自真理；是的，一个智者所想的善，就是真理，当他这样意愿并行出来的时候，就成为良善。</p>
<p>【2】不正确地区分这两个接受生命的容器，即意志和认知，并且对它们没有形成明确概念的人，试图了解灵性流注是徒劳的。因为有流注进入意志，有流注进入认知；有爱的良善的流注进入人的意志，有智慧的真理的流注进入人的认知，他们直接从耶和华上帝藉着祂所在其中的灵界太阳而来、或间接地通过天使的天堂而来。这两个容器，意志和认知，如同热和光一样不同，因为意志接受天堂的热，天堂的热本质上是爱；认知接受天堂的光，天堂的光本质上是智慧，正如上面所述。</p>
<p>【3】有流注从人的心智（mind）进入言语，并有流注进入行为；进入言语的流注是从意志通过认知而来，而进入行为的流注是从认知通过意志而来。只知道进入认知的流注、同时却不知道进入意志的流注的人，若从中推理和总结，就会像独眼的人，只看到一边的东西，同时看不到另一边的东西；像残疾人只用一只手笨拙地工作；又像瘸腿的人，用一只脚和拐杖蹒跚而行。由这些清楚可知，灵性的热流入人的意志，产生爱的良善；灵性的光流入人的认知，产生智慧的真理。</p>

<h4 align="center">Interaction of the Soul and Body (Elliott translation 2012) 7</h4><p>7. V. Both that heat and that light flow into man: the heat into his will, where it produces the good of love; and the light into his understanding, where it produces the truth of wisdom. <p>It is well known that all things universally have relation to good and truth, and that there is not a single thing in existence in which there is not something related to those two. On this account there are two receptacles of life in man: one, which is the receptacle of good, called the will; and another, which is the receptacle of truth, called the understanding; and, as good is of love and truth is of wisdom, the will is the receptacle of love, and the understanding the receptacle of wisdom. Good is of love, because what a man loves that he wills, and when he brings it into action he calls it good: and truth is of wisdom, because all wisdom is from truths; indeed, the good which a wise man thinks is truth, which becomes good when he wills and does it.</p><p>[2] He who does not rightly distinguish between these two receptacles of life, which are the will and the understanding, and does not form for himself a clear notion respecting them, strives in vain to comprehend the nature of spiritual influx. For there is influx into the will, and there is influx into the understanding. Into the will of man there is an influx of the good of love, and into his understanding there is an influx of the truth of wisdom, each proceeding from Jehovah God, directly through the sun in the midst of which He is, and indirectly through the angelic heaven. These two receptacles, the will and the understanding are as distinct as heat and light; for, as was said above, the will receives the heat of heaven, which in its essence is love, and the understanding receives the light of heaven, which in its essence is wisdom.</p><p>[3] There is an influx from the human mind into the speech, and there is an influx into the actions; the influx into speech is from the will through the understanding, but the influx into the actions is from the understanding through the will. Those who are only acquainted with the influx into the understanding, and not at the same time with that into the will, and who reason and conclude therefrom, are like one-eyed persons, who only see the objects on one side of them, and not at the same time those on the other; and like maimed persons, who do their work awkwardly with one hand only; and like lame persons, who walk by hopping on one foot, with the assistance of a staff. From these few observations it is plain that spiritual heat flows into the will of man, and produces the good of love, and that spiritual light flows into his understanding, and produces the truth of wisdom. </p>

BOTH THAT HEAT AND THAT LIGHT FLOW INTO MAN: THE HEAT INTO HIS WILL, WHERE IT PRODUCES THE GOOD OF LOVE; AND THE LIGHT INTO HIS UNDERSTANDING, WHERE IT PRODUCES THE TRUTH OF WISDOM. <p>It is well known that all things universally have relation to good and truth, and that there is not a single thing in existence in which there is not something related to those two.

<h4 align="center">Interaction of the Soul and Body (Whitehead translation 1892) 7</h4><p>7. V. Both that heat and that light flow into man, the heat into his will, where it produces the good of love, and the light into his understanding, where it produces the truth of wisdom. <p>It is known that all things universally have relation to good and truth, and that there is not given a single entity in which there is not what has relation to those two. From this it is that in man there are two receptacles of life, one which is the receptacle of good, which is called the will, and another which is the receptacle of truth, which is called the understanding; and as good is of love, and truth is of wisdom, the will is the receptacle of love, and the understanding is the receptacle of wisdom. That good is of love, is because what a man loves, this he wills, and when he does it he calls it good; and that truth is of wisdom, is because all wisdom is from truths; yea, the good which a wise man thinks, is truth, and this becomes good when he wills it and does it.</p><p>[2] He who does not rightly distinguish between these two receptacles of life, which are the will and the understanding, and does not form a clear notion concerning them, vainly endeavors to know spiritual influx; for there is influx into the will, and there is influx into the understanding; there is an influx of the good of love into man's will, and there is an influx of the truth of wisdom into his understanding, both of them from Jehovah God immediately through the sun in the midst of which He is, and mediately through the angelic heaven. These two receptacles, the will and the understanding, are as distinct as heat and light; for the will receives the heat of heaven, which in its essence is love, and the understanding receives the light of heaven, which in its essence is wisdom, as was said above.</p><p>[3] There is an influx from the human mind into the speech, and there is an influx into the actions; the influx into the speech is from the will through the understanding, but the influx into the actions is from the understanding through the will. They who know only of the influx into the understanding, and not at the same time into the will, and who reason and conclude from this, are like one-eyed persons, who see the objects on one side only, and not at the same time on the other; and like maimed persons, who do their work awkwardly with one hand only; and like the lame who hobble on one foot with a crutch. From these few things it is made plain, that spiritual heat flows into man's will, and produces the good of love, and that spiritual light flows into his understanding, and produces the truth of wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Commercio Animae et Corporis 7 (original Latin 1769)</h4><p>7. V. Quod tam Calor ille, quam Lux illa influant in hominem, Calor in ejus voluntatem, et producat ibi bonum amoris, et Lux in ejus intellectum, et producat ibi verum sapientiae. <p>Notum est quod universaliter omnia se referant ad Bonum et Verum, et quod non detur singulare ens in quo non relativum ad illa duo est; inde est quod in homine sint duo Receptacula vitae, unum quod est receptaculum Boni, quod vocatur Voluntas, alterum quod est receptaculum Veri, quod vocatur Intellectus; et quia Bonum est Amoris, et Verum est Sapientiae, est Voluntas receptaculum amoris, ac Intellectus receptaculum sapientiae. Quod bonum sit amoris, est quia homo quod amat, hoc velit, et cum operatur illud appellet bonum; et quod Verum sit sapientiae, est quia omnis sapientia est ex veris, imo bonum quod sapiens cogitat, est verum, et hoc fit bonum, cum vult et facit illud. Qui non rite distinguit inter bina illa Receptacula vitae, quae sunt Voluntas et Intellectus, et claram notionem sibi format de illis, frustra satagit cognoscere Influxum spiritualem, nam Influxus est in Voluntatem, et Influxus est in Intellectum, in Voluntatem hominis est Influxus boni amoris, et in Intellectum ejus est Influxus veri sapientiae, uterque a Jehovah Deo immediate per Solem in cujus medio est, et mediate per Caelum Angelicum. Bina illa Receptacula, Voluntas et Intellectus, tam distincta sunt, sicut sunt Calor et Lux, nam Voluntas recipit calorem caeli, qui in essentia sua est amor, ac Intellectus recipit lucem caeli, quae in essentia sua est sapientia, ut supra dictum est. Datur Influxus e Mente humana in loquelas, et datur in actiones, Influxus in loquelas fit ex Voluntate per Intellectum, Influxus autem in actiones fit ex Intellectu per Voluntatem: illi qui modo Influxum in intellectum, et non simul in voluntatem norunt, et ex illo ratiocinantur et concludunt, sunt sicut monoculi, qui modo vident objecta unius lateris, et non simul alterius; ac sicut manci, qui modo una manu contortim operantur: ac sicut claudi, qui super uno pede cum baculo subsultim ambulant. Ex his paucis explanatum est, quod Calor spiritualis influat in voluntatem hominis, et producat bonum amoris, et quod Lux spiritualis influat in intellectum ejus, et producat verum sapientiae. </p>
