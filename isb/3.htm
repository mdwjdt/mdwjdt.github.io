<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">一、有两个世界：灵人和天使所居住的灵界，世人所居住的自然界</h4>
<p>ISB3.有一个灵人和天使所居住的灵界，它不同于世人所居住的自然界，这一点迄今仍深深隐藏于基督教界。原因是，没有天使降下来口头教导它，也没有人升上去看见它。为免得出于对灵界的无知，以及由此造成的对天堂和地狱的不确定信仰，人变得昏头昏脑，以至于成为无神论的自然主义者，主乐意打开我的灵眼，把它提升到天堂，又让它下入地狱，向我展示两者的性质。</p>
<p>由此向我显明，有两个彼此不同的世界；一个因其中的一切事物都是属灵的，故被称为灵界；另一个因其中的一切事物都是属世的，故被称为自然界；灵人和天使生活在自己的世界，世人也生活在自己的世界；而且，每个人都通过死亡从自己的世界进入另一个世界，并在这个世界生活到永远。为使流注，也就是这本小册子所论述的主题，从它的起始就被揭示出来，必须先提供关于这两个世界的知识；因为灵界流入自然界，并驱动它的各个部分，包括人和动物，也构成植物和草本中的生长活动。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">3、（1）有两个世界，一个是灵人（spirit）和天使（angel）所在的灵界（spiritual world），另一个是世人所在的尘世（natural world）。</h4>
<p>有一个灵人和天使所在的灵界，不同于世人所在的尘世，（这认识）迄今已深深地隐藏在基督教界。原因是，没有天使降下来言传教导它，也没有人升上去看见它。因此，恐怕由于对那个世界的无知，以及由此产生的关于天堂和地狱的不确定的信仰，人们昏聩到成为无神论的自然主义者的程度。很高兴主开我的灵眼，提升到天堂，也降到地狱，呈现其情形让我观看。</p>
<p>【2】因此，正如已经向我显示的那样，有两个世界，彼此不同：一个被称为灵界，其中一切事物都是灵性的；另一个称为尘世（自然界），其中一切都是自然的；灵人和天使生活在自己的世界里，世人也活在自己的世界里，并且每个人死后，从自己的世界进入另一个世界，并在那里活到永远。</p>
<p>必须首先给出这两个世界的知识，以便在下面讨论流注时可以从它的起始来揭示，因为灵界流入尘世（自然界），并驱动它的各部分，包括人和动物，也构成树木和草本植物的活力。</p>

<h4 align="center">Interaction of the Soul and Body (Elliott translation 2012) 3</h4><p>3. I. There are two worlds: the spiritual world, inhabited by spirits and angels, and the natural world, inhabited by men. <p>That there is a spiritual world inhabited by spirits and angels distinct from the natural world inhabited by men, has hitherto been deeply hidden, even in the Christian world, because no angel has descended and taught it by word of mouth, nor has any man ascended and seen it. Lest, therefore, from ignorance of that world, and the uncertain faith respecting heaven and hell thence resulting, man should be so far infatuated as to become an atheistic materialist, it has pleased the Lord to open the sight of my spirit, and to raise it into heaven and let it down into hell, and to exhibit to my view the nature of both.</p><p>[2] It has thus been made evident to me that there are two worlds, distinct from each other; one, in which all things are spiritual, whence it is called the spiritual world; and the other, in which all things are natural, whence it is called the natural world: and also that spirits and angels live in their own world, and men in theirs; and further, that every man passes by death from his world into the other, and lives in it to eternity. In order that Influx, which is the subject of this little work, may be unfolded from its beginning, it is necessary that some information respecting both these worlds should be provided; for the spiritual world flows into the natural world, and actuates it in all its parts, with both men and beasts, and also constitutes the vegetative principle in trees and herbs. </p>
<h4 align="center">Interaction of the Soul and Body (Hartley translation 1924) 3</h4><p>3. I. THERE ARE TWO WORLDS: THE SPIRITUAL WORLD, INHABITED BY SPIRITS AND ANGELS, AND THE NATURAL WORLD, INHABITED BY MEN. <p>That there is a spiritual world inhabited by spirits and angels, distinct from the natural world inhabited by men, has hitherto been deeply hidden, even in the Christian world, because no angel has descended and taught it by word of mouth, nor has any man ascended and seen it. Lest, therefore, from ignorance of that world, and the uncertain faith respecting heaven and hell thence resulting, man should be so far infatuated as to become an atheistic materialist, it has pleased the Lord to open the sight of my spirit, and to raise it into heaven and let it down into hell, and to exhibit to my view the nature of both.</p><p>[2] It has thus been made evident to me that there are two worlds, distinct from each other; one, in which all things are spiritual, whence it is called the spiritual world; and the other, in which all things are natural, whence it is called the natural world: and also that spirits and angels live in their own world, and men in theirs; and further, that every man passes by death from his world into the other, and lives in it to eternity. In order that Influx, which is the subject of this little work, may be unfolded from its beginning, it is necessary that some information respecting both these worlds should be provided; for the spiritual world flows into the natural world, and actuates it in all its parts, with both men and beasts, and also constitutes the vegetative principle in trees and herbs. </p>
<h4 align="center">Interaction of the Soul and Body (Whitehead translation 1892) 3</h4><p>3. I. There are two worlds, the spiritual world, where spirits and angels are, and the natural world, where men are. <p>That there is a spiritual world, in which spirits and angels are, distinct from the natural world in which men are, has hitherto been deeply hidden even in the Christian world. The reason is, because no angel has descended and taught it by word of mouth, and no man has ascended and seen it. Lest therefore from ignorance of that world, and the uncertain faith concerning heaven and hell resulting from it, man should be infatuated to such a degree as to become an atheistic naturalist, it has pleased the Lord to open the sight of my spirit, and to elevate it into heaven, and also to let it down into hell, and to present to view the quality of both.</p><p>[2] Thence it has thus been manifested to me that there are two worlds, which are distinct from each other; one in which all things are spiritual, which is therefore called the spiritual world, and the other in which all things are natural, and thence is called the natural world; and that spirits and angels live in their own world, and men in theirs; and also that every man passes by death from his own world into the other, and in this he lives to eternity. A knowledge of both of these worlds must be given first, in order that influx, which is here treated of, may be disclosed from its beginning; for the spiritual world flows into the natural world, and actuates it in all its parts, both with men and with beasts, and also constitutes the vegetative activity in trees and herbs. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Commercio Animae et Corporis 3 (original Latin 1769)</h4><p>3. I. Quod duo Mundi sint, Mundus spiritualis ubi sunt Spiritus et Angeli, et Mundus naturalis, ubi sunt Homines. <p>Quod sit Mundus spiritualis, in quo sunt Spiritus et Angeli, distinctus a Mundo naturali in quo sunt homines, hactenus in Orbe etiam Christiano alte latuit; causa est, quia non aliquis Angelus descendit et oretenus docuit, nec aliquis homo ascendit et vidit; ne itaque ex ignorantia illius Mundi, et inde ex ancipite fide de Caelo et Inferno, homo infatuaretur in tantum ut fieret Naturalista atheus, placuit Domino aperire visum spiritus mei, et hunc elevare in Caelum, et quoque demittere in Infernum, et exhibere videndum quale est utrumque. Inde patuit mihi quod duo Mundi sint, et illi inter se distincti, unus in quo omnia spiritualia sunt et inde vocatur Mundus spiritualis, et alter in quo omnia naturalia sunt, et inde vocatur Mundus naturalis, ac quod spiritus et angeli in suo Mundo vivant, ac homines in suo; tum quod unusquisque homo per mortem transmigret e suo in alterum, et in hoc vivat in aeternum. Cognitio de utroque hoc mundo praemittenda est, ut a principio suo detegatur Influxus, de quo hic agitur; influit enim Mundus spiritualis in Mundum Naturalem, et actuat hunc in singulis ejus, tam apud homines quam apud bestias, et quoque facit vegetativum in arboribus et herbis. </p>
