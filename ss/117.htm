<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第117节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS117.自上古时代起就有宗教的存在，世界各地的居民都知道神，对死后的生命也有所了解；但这种知识绝非来自他们自己，或他们自己的聪明、敏锐，而是来自前面所说的古圣言（101-103节），后来则来自以色列人的圣言。宗教事物从这两部圣言传到印度及其群岛，并经埃及和埃塞俄比亚传到非洲各国，又从亚洲沿海地区传到希腊，从希腊传到意大利。然而，由于圣言只能通过代表写成，而这些代表是世上诸如对应于天上事物，并因此表示或象征它们的那类事物，所以许多民族的宗教沦为偶像崇拜，在希腊则沦为神话传说，其中神的属性和特征变成了众多神明；他们还设了一位至高神来管理这些神，并根据耶和华的名字给这位神起名叫朱庇特。众所周知，他们知道伊甸园，大洪水和圣火，知道四个时代，从第一个时代，即黄金时代直到最后一个时代，即铁器时代；而在圣言中，这四个时代表示教会的四个状态（如但以理书2:31-35）。人们还知道，后来出现并摧毁许多民族以前的宗教的伊斯兰教取自新旧约圣言。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 117</h4>
<p>117. As for the fact that there has been religion from the earliest times and that people all over the world have known about God and have known something about life after death, this did not come from the people themselves and from their own mental acuity, but from that former Word discussed in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_2_31.htm">Daniel 2:31-35</a>.
<p>It is also common knowledge that Islam, which came later and wiped out the preceding religious cultures of many nations, was drawn from the Word of both Testaments. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 117</h4><p>117. Religion has existed from ancient times, and the inhabitants of the world have everywhere known of the existence of God, and something of the life after death, not on their own or owing to their own acumen, but from the Ancient Word (as discussed above, nos. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_2_31.htm">Daniel 2:31-35</a>.<p>People also know that the Muslim religion which followed, and which destroyed many peoples’ earlier religions, was derived from the Word of both Testaments. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 117</h4><p>117. Religion has existed from the most ancient times, and the inhabitants of the world everywhere have had a knowledge of God, and some knowledge of a life after death. This has not originated from themselves or their own intelligence, but from the Ancient Word mentioned above Nos. 101-103; and in later times from the Israelitish Word. From these two Words forms of religion spread to the Indies and their Islands, through Egypt and Ethiopia to the kingdoms of Africa, from the maritime parts of Asia to Greece, and thence to Italy. However, as the Word could only be written by representatives, that is, by such things in the world as correspond to and signify heavenly things, therefore religion with many nations was turned into idolatry, and in Greece into mythology. Divine attributes and properties were turned into so many gods, and over these men set one supreme deity whom they called Jove from Jehovah; while it is well known that they had some conception of Paradise, some knowledge of the Flood, the sacred fire, and the four ages from the first or golden age to the last or iron age, by which in the Word are signified the four states of the Church as described in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_2_31.htm">Daniel 2:31-35</a>. It is also known that the Mohammedan religion, which succeeded and destroyed the former religious systems of many nations, was taken from the Word of both Testaments. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 117</h4><p>117. That from the most ancient times there has been religion, and that everywhere the inhabitants of the world have had knowledge of God, and have known something about a life after death, has not originated in themselves or their own penetration, but from the Ancient Word (spoken of above, n. <a href="../ss/101.htm">101-103</a>), and, at a later period, from the Israelitish Word. From these two Words the things of religion have spread into the Indies and their islands, and through Egypt and Ethiopia into the kingdoms of Africa, and from the maritime parts of Asia into Greece, and from thence into Italy. But as the Word could not be written in any other way than by means of representatives, which are such things in this world as correspond to heavenly things, and therefore signify them, the things of religion among many of the nations were turned into idolatry, and in Greece into fables, and the Divine attributes and predicates into so many gods, over whom they set one supreme, whom they called "Jove" <sup>1</sup>fro <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_2_31.htm">Daniel 2:31-35</a>). It is also known that the Mohammedan religion, which came later and destroyed the former religions of many nations, was taken from the Word of both Testaments.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;Perhaps; see True Christian Religion, n. 275.

<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 117 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>117. Quod ab antiquissimis temporibus fuerit religio, et incolae orbis ubivis noverint de Deo, et aliquid de vita post mortem, non fuit ex ipsis, et ex proprio illorum acumine, sed ex Verbo Vetusto (de quo supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_117/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_101">101-103</a>), et postea ex Verbo Israelitico. Ex his religiosa emanaverunt in Indias et illarum insulas; perque Aegyptum ac Aethiopiam in regna Africae; et ex maritimis Asiae in Graeciam; et inde in Italiam. Sed quia Verbum non potuit aliter quam per repraesentativa esse conscriptum, quae sunt talia in mundo quae correspondent caelestibus et inde significant illa, ideo religiosa plurium gentium versa sunt in idolatrica, et in Graecia in fabulosa; ac attributa et praedicata Divina in totidem Deos, quibus praefecerunt supremum, quem vocaverunt Jovem (forte <sup>1</sup>) a Jehovah. Quod illis cognitio fuerit de paradiso, de diluvio, de igne sacro, de quatuor aetatibus, a prima aurea ad ultimam ferream, per quas in Verbo significantur quatuor status ecclesiae, (ut apud Danielem, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_117/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_2_31-35">Danielem 2:31-35</a>), notum est. Quod religiosum Mahumedanum, quod successit, et religiosa plurium gentium priora delevit, ex Verbo utriusque Testamenti desumptum sit, etiam notum est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;forte:- sic <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_117/swedenborg_vera-christiana-religio_275">Vera Christiana Religio 275</a> </p>
