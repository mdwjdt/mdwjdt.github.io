<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS82.我说过，在圣言每一个细节里面都有主与教会的一个婚姻，因而有良善与真理的一个婚姻，因为哪里有主与教会的婚姻，那里也有良善与真理的婚姻，后者来自前者。因为当教会或教会成员处于真理时，主就以良善流入他的真理，并使它们活过来；或也可说，当教会或教会成员通过真理而处于聪明时，主通过爱与仁之良善流入他的聪明，从而使他的聪明充满生命。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 82</h4>
<p>82. I have said that there is a marriage of the Lord and the church in the details of the Word and a consequent marriage of goodness and truth because wherever there is a marriage of the Lord and the church there is also a marriage of goodness and truth. The latter comes from the former because when the church or its membership is focused on what is true, the Lord flows into their truths with what is good and brings those truths to life. Or to put it another way, when the church or members of the church are intelligent because of truths, then the Lord flows into their intelligence through the good they do out of love and caring, and fills their intelligence with life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 82</h4><p>82. We say that every constituent of the Word contains a marriage of the Lord and the church and so a marriage of goodness and truth, because wherever a marriage of the Lord and the church is found, present there also is a marriage of goodness and truth. Indeed, from the first springs the latter. For when the church or a person of the church is governed by truths, the Lord then flows into those truths with goodness and gives them life. Or in other words, when the church or a person of the church possesses intelligence as a result of truths, then the Lord flows through the goodness of love and charity into that intelligence and so infuses it with life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 82</h4><p>82. It is said that in every detail of the Word there is the marriage of the Lord and the Church, and consequently the marriage of good and truth; because where there is the marriage of the Lord and the Church, there is also the marriage of good and truth, the latter resulting from the former. For when the Church, or a man of the Church, is principled in truths, the Lord then enters into those truths with good, and makes them live; or what is the same, when the Church, or a man of the Church, is in intelligence by means of truths, the Lord then enters his intelligence through the good of love and charity, and thus infuses life into it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 82</h4><p>82. It is said that in each and every thing of the Word there is a marriage of the Lord and the church and a derivative marriage of good and truth, because wherever there is a marriage of the Lord and the church there is also a marriage of good and truth, for the latter is from the former. For when the church or man of the church is in truths, the Lord inflows into his truths with good, and vivifies them. Or what is the same, when through truths the church or man of the church is in intelligence, the Lord inflows into his intelligence through the good of love and of charity, and thus pours life into it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 82 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>82. Dicitur, quod in singulis Verbi sit conjugium Domini et ecclesiae, et inde conjugium boni et veri; quia ubi conjugium Domini et ecclesiae est, ibi etiam conjugium boni et veri est, est enim hoc ab illo: nam cum ecclesia seu homo ecclesiae in veris est, tunc Dominus in vera ejus influit cum bono, et illa vivificat; seu quod idem, cum ecclesia seu homo ecclesiae per vera in intelligentia est, tunc Dominus per bonum amoris et charitatis in intelligentiam ejus influit, et sic ei infundit vitam. </p>
