<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第93节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS93.在灵界，我曾与一些生活在许多世纪以前，并确认自己的宗教虚假之人交谈过，发现他们仍坚定地忠于这些虚假。在那里，我也与一些曾属于相同的宗教，有同样的想法，但并未确认这些虚假的人交谈过，发现他们被天使教导后，就弃绝虚假，吸收真理；这些人得救了，而其他人没有得救。死后，每个人都会被天使教导；那些看见真理，并从真理看见虚假的人被接纳了。因为那时，以属灵的方式看见真理的能力会被赋予每个人，那些没有确认虚假的人就看见它们；但那些确认的人不想看见真理，即便看见，也会背过身去，要么嘲笑它们，要么歪曲它们。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 93</h4>
<p>93. I have talked with individuals in the spiritual world who lived some centuries ago and who had convinced themselves of the falsities of their religion, and I have found them to be still firmly loyal to the same opinions. I have talked with some there who were of the same religion and who thought along the same lines but had not inwardly convinced themselves of those falsities, and I have found that when given angelic instruction they rejected their false beliefs and absorbed true ones. These latter were saved while the others were not.
<p>Everyone is given angelic instruction after death, and we are accepted if we see what is true and see what is false on the basis of what is true, because after death everyone is given the ability to see truths spiritually. The people who do see what is true are the ones who have not convinced themselves [of what is false]; but the ones who have convinced themselves [of what is false] do not want to see what is true. If they do see it they turn their backs to it and either ridicule it or distort it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 93</h4><p>93. I have spoken with some in the spiritual world who lived many centuries ago and confirmed themselves in the falsities of their religion, and I found that they remained steadfastly caught up in them.<p>I have also spoken with some there who were adherents of the same religion and thought as those others did, but who inwardly did not affirm its falsities, and I found that on being instructed by angels, they rejected the falsities and learned truths, and were saved, unlike the others.<p>Every person after death is instructed by angels, and those who see truths, and falsities in the light of those truths, are accepted. For everyone is given the ability after death to see truths spiritually. Those who have not confirmed themselves in falsities see truths, whereas those who have so confirmed themselves are unwilling to see truths, and if they do see them, they turn their backs on them, and then either deride them or falsify them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 93</h4><p>93. I have conversed in the spiritual world with some who lived many ages ago, and who had confirmed themselves in the falsities of their religion; and I found that they still firmly adhered to them. I have also conversed with some in that world who had been of the same religion and had entertained the same ideas as the others, but had not confirmed themselves in its falsities; and I learned that they, after being instructed by angels, had rejected the falsities and had acquired truths. These had been saved, but the others were not. Every man after death is instructed by angels, and those are received [into heaven] who perceive truths and, from truths, falsities; for everyone after death is granted to see truths spiritually. They see truths who have not confirmed themselves in falsities; but those who have so confirmed themselves do not wish to see truths; and if they are presented to them, they turn themselves away, and then either ridicule or falsify them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 93</h4><p>93. I have conversed with some in the spiritual world who had lived many ages ago, and had confirmed themselves in the falsities of their religion, and I found that they still remained steadfast in the same. I have also conversed there with some who had been of the same religion as they, and had thought as they did, but had not confirmed themselves in its falsities, and I found that after being instructed by angels these had rejected the falsities and had imbibed truths, and that these were saved, but not the others. After death every man is instructed by angels, and those who see truths, and from truths falsities, are received. For the power to see truths spiritually is then given everyone, and those see them who have not confirmed themselves in falsities, but those who have confirmed themselves do not want to see truths, and if they do see them they turn their backs on them, and then either ridicule or falsify them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 93 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>93. Locutus sum cum quibusdam in mundo spirituali, qui ante plura saecula vixerunt, et se confirmaverunt in falsis religionis suae; et compertus sum, quod in iisdem adhuc constanter manerent: et locutus sum cum quibusdam ibi, qui ex eadem religione fuerunt, et cogitaverunt sicut illi, sed non confirmaverunt falsa ejus apud se; et compertus sum, quod instructi ab angelis falsa rejecerint, et vera imbuerint; et quod hi salvati sint, non autem illi. Unusquisque homo post mortem instruitur ab angelis, et recipiuntur illi qui vera vident, et ex veris falsa; nam datur cuivis vera spiritualiter videre post mortem; vera vident illi qui non se confirmaverunt (in falsis <sup>1</sup>); sed qui se confirmaverunt, non volunt videre vera; et si vident, se retro vertunt, et tunc vel ad illa rident, vel illa falsificant.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Verba uncis inclusa in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_93/swedenborg_vera-christiana-religio_255">Vera Christiana Religio 255</a> videantur. </p>
