<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第44节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS44.圣言字义的真理和良善由乌陵和土明来表示。乌陵和土明在亚伦的以弗得上，亚伦的祭司职分代表神性良善和拯救工作方面的主。祭司的衣服，或圣衣代表来自神性良善的神性真理。以弗得代表最外在形式上的神性真理，因而代表字义上的圣言，因为如前所述，这就是最外在形式上的神性真理。因此，带有以色列十二支派名字的十二块宝石（也就是乌陵和土明）代表来自神性良善的神性真理的整个综合体。</p>
<p>关于这些，我们在摩西五经中读到：</p>
<p>他们要拿金线和蓝色、紫色、染过两次的朱红色线，并捻的细麻作以弗得。你要做一个决断的胸牌，要和以弗得一样的作法作它；你要给它镶上镶石头，要有四行石头，第一行依次是：红宝石、黄玉、红玉；第二行是绿宝石、蓝宝石、金钢石；第三行是青金石、白玛瑙、紫晶；第四行是水苍玉、红玛瑙、碧玉。这些石头都要按着以色列人的名字，用印章的刻法，各按自己的名字代表十二个支派。亚伦要带着乌陵和土明的决断牌，在耶和华面前常放在心上。（出埃及记28:6，15-21，29-30）</p>
<p>我在《属天的奥秘》的这一章（9819-9966节）解释了亚伦的衣服，即他的以弗得，外袍、内袍，冠冕，腰带表示什么。那里说明，以弗得代表最外在形式上的神性真理；其中的宝石代表因良善而透明的真理；十二块宝石代表因爱之良善而透明、在其秩序中的最外在形式上的一切真理；以色列的十二支派代表教会的一切事物；胸牌代表来自神性良善的神性真理；乌陵和土明代表来自神性良善的最外在形式上的神性真理的光辉。事实上，在天使的语言中，“乌陵”表示发光的火；“土明”表示光辉，在希伯来语，“土明”表示整体性。那里还说明，答复是通过光的变化和同时默示的感知，或一种活生生的声音给出的。由此明显可知，这些宝石表示来自良善、在圣言最外在意义上的真理；天上来的答复只以这种方式给出，因为在这层意义上，神性发出在它的完全中。</p>
<p>宝石和钻石表示最外在形式上的神性真理，如圣言字义中的真理，这一点从灵界中的宝石和钻石或冠冕已经清楚向我显明；我看见宝石和钻石或冠冕就在那里的天使和灵人当中，还看见天使佩戴它们，又看见他们珠宝盒里的宝石。我得以知道它们对应于最外在形式上的真理；事实上，正是这种对应使得这些宝石存在并显现，或说它们因这些真理而存在并显现。由于钻石和宝石或冠冕表示这些真理，所以约翰看见冠冕在龙的头上（启示录12:3）；兽角上（启示录13:1）；宝石在坐在朱红色兽上的大淫妇身上（启示录17:4）。冠冕和宝石之所以出现在龙、兽和淫妇身上，是因为它们表示基督教会拥有圣言的人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 44</h4>
<p>44. The good and true elements of the literal meaning of the Word are meant by the Urim and Thummim.
<p>The Urim and Thummim were on the ephod of Aaron, whose priesthood represented the Lord’s divine goodness and his work of salvation. The sacred garments of priesthood represented the divine truth that arises from divine goodness. The ephod represented divine truth in its outermost form and therefore the Word in its literal meaning because this, as noted above [<a href="../ss/1.htm">1-4</a>; [2], <a href="../ss/27.htm">27-36</a>; <a href="../ss/38.htm">38</a>[2]], is divine truth in its outermost form. So the twelve precious stones with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, which were the Urim and Thummim, mean the complete assemblage of divine truths arising from divine goodness.</p>
<p>[2] This is what we read in Moses:
<p>They shall make an ephod of blue, purple, and double-dyed scarlet [thread], and fine woven linen. Then they shall make a breastplate of judgment matching the work of the ephod. And you shall put settings of stones in it, four rows of stones: carnelian, topaz, and emerald, the first row; chrysoprase, sapphire, and diamond, the second row; jacinth, agate, and amethyst, the third row; and beryl, sardius, and jasper, the fourth row. The stones shall have the names of the sons of Israel, [like] the engravings of a signet, each one with its own name; they shall be according to the twelve tribes. Aaron shall wear the Urim and Thummim on the breastplate of judgment, and they shall be over Aaron’s heart when he goes in before Jehovah. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_6.htm">Exodus 28:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_15.htm">15-21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_30.htm">30</a>)</p>
<p>[3] I have explained in the appropriate chapter of Secrets of Heaven [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9819.htm">9819-9966</a>] the meaning of Aaron’s garments - the ephod, the robe, the tunic, the turban, and the belt. There it is shown that the ephod represented divine truth in its outermost form; the precious stones represented truths from which light shines because they teach what is good; the twelve precious stones represented all the truths, in the right arrangement, that shine in their outermost form because good actions from love are what they teach; the twelve tribes of Israel represented all aspects of the church; the breastplate represented divine truth that comes from divine goodness; and the Urim and Thummim represented the radiance of divine truth that comes from divine goodness, in its outermost forms. In fact, in the language of angels, “Urim” means shining fire and “Thummim” means radiance. (In Hebrew the latter means “wholeness”.) It is also shown there that oracular answers were given by variations in the light accompanied by silently projected ideas or even by words that resounded aloud, and other methods.</p>
<p>[4] We can conclude from this that the precious stones also meant truths in the outermost meaning of the Word that come from goodness; and this is the only way oracular answers are given from heaven, because that is the meaning in which the emanating divine is fully present. By seeing precious stones and diamonds among angels and spirits in the spiritual world, I have been able to see very clearly that precious stones and diamonds mean divine truths in their outermost forms, like the truths in the literal meaning of the Word. I have seen angels wearing them and have seen gems in their jewel boxes. I have also been granted to know that they correspond to truths in outermost form - in fact, this correspondence is what causes these precious stones and diamonds to exist and to look the way they do.
<p>Since this is what diamonds and precious stones mean, John also saw them on the head of the dragon (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>), on the horns of the beast (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>), and on the whore who was sitting on the scarlet beast (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>). He saw them on these creatures because they meant the people of the Christian church, who have the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 44</h4><p>44. Truths and goods in the Word’s literal sense are meant by the Urim and Thummim. The Urim and Thummim were placed on the ephod of Aaron, whose priesthood represented the Lord in respect to His Divine goodness and in respect to His work of salvation. Priestly vestments or holy garments represented Divine truth springing from Divine goodness. The ephod represented Divine truth in its outmost expression, thus the Word in its literal sense, for that is Divine truth in its outmost expression, as we said above. Consequently the twelve precious stones, bearing the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, which were the Urim and Thummim, represented Divine truths springing from Divine goodness in their entirety.</p><p>[2] Regarding the Urim and Thummim, we read in Exodus the following:<p>They shall make the ephod of gold, blue and purple, of scarlet double-dyed, and fine linen interwoven.... (Afterward) you shall make the breastpiece of judgment..., according to the workmanship of the ephod.... And you shall fill it with settings of stones, four rows of stones: ...a garnet, a topaz, and an emerald, the first row; ...a chrysoprase, a sapphire, and a diamond, the second row; a lazulite, an agate, and an amethyst, the third row; a beryl, a sardius, and a jasper, the fourth row.... These stones shall have the names of the sons of Israel..., like the engravings of a signet, each one with its own name, for the twelve tribes.... And Aaron shall bear (the Urim and Thummim) on the breastplate of judgment...over his heart, when he goes in...before Jehovah. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_6.htm">Exodus 28:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_15.htm">15-21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_29.htm">29-30</a>)</p><p>[3] What Aaron’s vestments represented — his ephod, robe, tunic, turban, and sash — was explained in Arcana Coelestia (The Secrets of Heaven) in our treatment of this chapter. There we showed that the ephod represented Divine truth in its outmost expression; that the precious stones on it represented truths made translucent by goodness; that the twelve precious stones represented all outmost expressions of truth in succession made translucent by the goodness of love; that the twelve tribes of Israel represented everything having to do with the church; that the breastpiece represented Divine truth springing from Divine goodness; and that the Urim and Thummim represented the radiance in outmost expressions of Divine truth springing from Divine goodness. For Urim means a shining fire, and Thummim means, in angelic language, radiance, and in Hebrew, perfection. Answers, moreover, were given by variegations of the light, and at the same time by a tacit perception or by hearing a voice, and in other ways as well.<p>It can be seen from this that these precious stones also represented truths springing from goodness in the Word’s outmost sense. Nor were answers given from heaven by any other means, because in that sense the emanating Divinity is present in its fullness.</p><p>[4] Precious stones and jewels symbolize Divine truths in their outmost expressions, the kind of truths found in the Word’s literal sense, and this has been made clearly apparent to me from the precious stones and jewels in the spiritual world possessed by angels and spirits there, whom I have seen wearing them, and which they also have in their jewelry cases. I have been given to know moreover that these precious stones and jewels correspond to truths in outmost expressions, indeed that they also exist and are visible because of those truths.<p>Because jewels and precious stones have this symbolism, therefore jewels were seen by John on the head of the dragon in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>, and on the horns of the beast in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>. And he saw precious stones on the harlot sitting on the scarlet beast in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>. These were seen on them because those figures symbolize people in the Christian world who possess the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 44</h4><p>44. (2) THE TRUTHS AND GOODS OF THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD ARE MEANT BY THE URIM AND THUMMIM. <p>The Urim and Thummim were on Aaron's ephod, for by his priesthood the Lord was represented as to Divine Good and the work of salvation. By the garments of the priesthood, or of holiness, was represented Divine Truth from Divine Good. By the ephod was represented Divine Truth in its ultimate, and thus the Word in the sense of the Letter, for this is Divine Truth in its ultimate, as was said above. Therefore, by the twelve precious stones with the names of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, which were the Urim and Thummim, were represented Divine truths from the Divine Good in the whole complex.<p> </p><p>[2] Concerning these things it is thus written in Moses: <p>They shall make the ephod ... of blue, and of purple, of scarlet doubledyed and fine twined linen ... And they shall make the breastplate of judgment ... after the work of the ephod ... and thou shalt set it in settings of stone, even four rows of stones: the first row shall be a ruby, a topaz and an emerald: the second row shall be a chrysoprasus, a sapphire and a diamond; the third row a lapis-lazuli, an agate and an amethyst; and the fourth row a beryl, a sardius and a jasper.... The stones shall be according to the names of the sons (A.V. Children) of Israel; the engravings of the signet shall be according to the name of every one for the twelve tribes.... And Aaron shall bear on the breastplate of judgment the Urim and Thummim ... and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before Jehovah. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_6.htm">Exodus 28:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_15.htm">15-21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_29.htm">29-30</a>.<p> </p><p>[3] What the garments of Aaron, his ephod, robe, coat, mitre and girdle represented is explained in the ARCANA CAELESTIA on this chapter of Exodus; where it is shown that by the ephod was represented Divine Truth in its ultimate. By the precious stones upon it were represented truths transparent from good; by the twelve precious stones, all ultimate truths transparent from the good of love, in their order. By the twelve tribes of Israel, all things of the Church; by the breastplate, Divine Truth from Divine Good; and by the Urim and Thummim, the brilliancy of Divine Truth from Divine Good in ultimates: for Urim is a shining fire, and Thummim brilliancy in the angelic language, and integrity in the Hebrew. It is also shown that responses were given by the variegations of light, and at the same time by tacit perception, or by a living voice; with many other particulars.<p> </p><p>[4] From this it may be evident that by these precious stones were also signified truths from good in the ultimate sense of the Word; and that by no other means are responses given from heaven, because in that sense is the Divine proceeding in its fulness.<p>That precious stones and diadems signify Divine truths in their ultimates, such as are the truths of the sense of the Letter of the Word, has been made clearly manifest to me from the precious stones and diadems in the spiritual world with angels and spirits there, whom I have seen wearing them; and I have also seen them in their caskets. It was granted me to know that these corresponded to truths in ultimates; indeed, that hence also they have their origin and appearance. Because of this signification of diamonds and precious stones they were also seen by John upon the head of the dragon, in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>; and upon the horns of the beast, in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>. And there were precious stones on the harlot who sat on the scarlet beast. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>. These precious stones were seen upon them because by them are signified those in the Christian world with whom is the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 44</h4><p>44. The truths and goods of the sense of the letter of the Word are meant by the Urim and Thummim. The Urim and Thummim were on the ephod of Aaron, whose priesthood represented the Lord as to Divine good and as to the work of salvation. The garments of the priesthood or of holiness represented Divine truth from Divine good. The ephod represented Divine truth in its ultimate, thus the Word in the sense of the letter, for this, as before said, is Divine truth in its ultimate. Consequently the twelve precious stones bearing the names of the twelve tribes of Israel (which were the Urim and Thummim) represented Divine truths from Divine good in their whole complex.</p><p>[2] Concerning these we read in Moses:<p>They shall make the ephod of [gold], hyacinthine blue, and bright crimson, of scarlet double dyed, and fine linen intertwined. And thou shalt make a breastplate of judgment according to the work of the ephod; and thou shalt set it with settings of stones, four rows of stones: the first row a ruby, a topaz, and an emerald; the second row a chrysoprase, a sapphire, and a diamond; the third row a cyanus, an agate, and an amethyst; the fourth row a thalassius, a sardius, and a jasper. These stones shall be according to the names of the sons of Israel; the engravings of a signet according to his name shall be for the twelve tribes. And Aaron shall carry upon the breastplate of judgment the Urim and Thummim and let them be upon the heart of Aaron when he goeth in before Jehovah (Exodus 28: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_15.htm">15-21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_29.htm">29-30</a>).</p><p>[3] What was represented by Aaron's garments - his ephod, robe, vest, miter, belt - has been unfolded in Arcana Coelestia on this chapter, where it is shown that the ephod represented Divine truth in its ultimate; the precious stones in it, truths pellucid from good; the twelve precious stones, all ultimate truths pellucid from the good of love in their order; the twelve tribes of Israel, all things of the church; the breast-plate, Divine truth from Divine good; the Urim and Thummim, the shining forth in ultimates of Divine truth from Divine good (for Urim means a shining fire; and Thummim, in the angelic language, means a shining forth, and in the Hebrew, entirety). Besides many other things, it is there shown also that answers were given by variegations of light and a simultaneous tacit perception, or by a living voice. From all this it is evident that these precious stones signified truths from good in the ultimate sense of the Word; nor are answers from heaven given by other means, for in this sense the Divine proceeding is in its fullness.</p><p>[4] That precious stones and diadems signify Divine truths in their ultimates, such as are the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, has been made very evident to me from precious stones and diadems in the spiritual world, among the angels and spirits there whom I have seen wearing them - I have seen them in their caskets also - and it has been given me to know that they correspond to truths in ultimates, and, what is more, that from these truths they exist and come into view. As these truths are signified by diadems and precious stones, John saw diadems<p>Upon the head of the dragon (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>);<p>Upon the horns of the beast (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>);<p>And precious stones upon the harlot that sat on the scarlet beast (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>).<p>Diadems and precious stones were seen upon the dragon, the beast, and the harlot, because these signify the people in the Christian world who are in possession of the Word. </p>

Urim et Thummim erant super ephodo Aharonis, per cujus sacerdotium repraesentabatur Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum, et quoad opus salvationis. Per vestes sacerdotii seu sanctitatis repraesentabatur Divinum Verum ex Divino Bono: per ephodum repraesentabatur Divinum Verum in suo ultimo, ita Verbum in sensu litterae, nam hoc est Divinum Verum in suo ultimo, ut supra dictum est; inde per duodecim lapides pretiosos, cum nominibus duodecim tribuum Israelis, quae fuerunt Urim et Thummim, repraesentabantur Divina vera ex Divino Bono in omni complexu.
