<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第20节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS20.（d）这灵义至今不为人知。我在《天堂与地狱》一书（87-105节）已说明：自然界的一切事物，无论总体还是细节，以及人体的一切事物，都对应于属灵事物。然而，迄今为止，人们还不知道什么叫对应，尽管在上古时代，这是众所周知的；因为那时，对应学是学问中的学问，或说至高无上的学问，并且如此普遍，以至于所有著作和书卷都是通过对应写成的。</p>
<p>约伯记这本古书就充满对应。埃及人的象形文字和古代神话，就具有类似性质，它们无非是对应。所有古代教会都是代表天上事物的教会；它们的仪式，以及它们的敬拜设立所依据的律例纯由对应构成。建立在雅各子孙当中的教会，其一切事物也是如此；他们的燔祭和祭物，以及与之相关的一切事物都是对应；会幕及其中一切事物，他们的节期，如除酵节、住棚节、七七节或收割节，还有亚伦和利未人的祭司职分，以及亚伦和他儿子的圣衣都是对应；此外涉及其敬拜和生活的一切律例和典章同样是对应。</p>
<p>由于神性事物在世上以对应显现，所以圣言纯粹通过对应写成。因此，主通过对应说话，因为祂出于祂的神性说话。事实上，凡从神性发出之物，在降至自然界时，都会转化为诸如对应于神性事物的那类事物；这些事物将被称为属天和属灵的神性事物储存并隐藏在自己里面。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 20</h4>
<p>20. 4. The spiritual meaning of the Word has not been recognized before. It was explained in <a href="../hh/87.htm">Heaven and Hell 87-105</a> that absolutely everything in the physical world corresponds to something spiritual, as does absolutely everything in the human body. However, the nature of this correspondence has been unknown until the present time, even though it was common knowledge in ancient times. For the people who lived in those times, the knowledge of how things correspond to each other was the very essence of knowledge. This knowledge was so universal that it governed the writing of all their scrolls and books.</p>
<p>[2] The Book of Job, which is an ancient work, is full of correspondences. So were the Egyptian hieroglyphs and the fables of the earliest peoples. All the ancient churches had practices that symbolized heavenly things. Their rituals, as well as the regulations underlying their worship, were made up entirely of correspondences. The same held true for everything about the church among the children of Jacob - their burnt offerings and sacrifices were correspondences even with respect to details. So were the tabernacle and everything in it. So were their feasts - the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Tabernacles, the Feast of First Fruits. So too was the priesthood of Aaron and the Levites as well as the sacred garments of Aaron and his sons. So also were all the laws and judgments that had to do with their worship and life.</p>
<p>[3] And since divine things become manifest in this world by means of correspondences, the Word was written entirely by means of them. That is why the Lord, speaking as he did from his divine nature, spoke in correspondences, since in the physical world whatever comes from the divine nature clothes itself in things that correspond to divine realities and that therefore conceal in their embrace the divine realities that we call heavenly and spiritual. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 20</h4><p>20. 4. The spiritual sense of the Word has been previously unknown. Every single thing found in nature corresponds to something spiritual. So, too, every single thing found in the human body. This is something we showed in the book <a href="../hh/87.htm">Heaven and Hell 87-115</a>. But what correspondence is has been previously unknown, even though in very ancient times it was quite well known. For people who lived then, the study of correspondences was the supreme study, and so universal that all their manuscripts and books were written in terms of correspondences.</p><p>[2] The book of Job, which is an ancient book, is full of correspondences.<p>Egyptian hieroglyphics, and also the fables of antiquity, were full of them too.<p>The ancient churches were all representative of things pertaining to heaven. Their rites and likewise their statutes, in accord with which their worship was instituted, consisted of nothing but correspondences.<p>So, too, everything connected with the church among the descendants of Jacob. Their whole burnt offerings and other sacrifices in their every particular were correspondent forms. Likewise the Tabernacle, with everything in it. And their feasts as well, such as the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Tabernacles, and the Feast of Firstfruits.<p>So also the priesthood of Aaron and the Levites, including the holy vestments of Aaron and his sons. And all the statutes and judgments as well which had to do with their worship and life.</p><p>[3] And because Divine emanations in the world manifest themselves in correspondent forms, therefore the Word was written solely in terms of correspondences. Because the Lord spoke in accordance with His Divinity, He consequently spoke in terms of correspondences. For whatever emanates from the Divine, descends into such expressions in nature as correspond to their Divine origins, and these expressions then conceal within them the Divine contents called celestial and spiritual. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 20</h4><p>20. 4. THE SPIRITUAL SENSE OF THE WORD HAS HITHERTO BEEN UNKNOWN. <p>That all things in nature, both general and particular, and also all things in the human body, correspond to spiritual things is shown in the work <a href="../hh/87.htm">HEAVEN AND HELL 87-105</a>. What correspondence is, however, has hitherto been unknown; yet in most ancient times it was very well known, for to those who lived then the science of correspondences was the science of sciences, and was so universal that all their treatises and books were written by correspondences. The Book of Job, which is an ancient book, is full of correspondences.<p> </p><p>[2] The hieroglyphics of the Egyptians and the myths of antiquity were of a like nature. All the ancient Churches were representative of heavenly things; and their ceremonies and also the statutes on which their worship was founded, consisted of pure correspondences. Of a like nature were all the things of the Church established among the Children of Jacob; their burnt offerings and sacrifices with all the things connected with them were correspondences. So also was the tabernacle with every thing in it; and likewise their feasts, as the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of tabernacles, and the feast of the first fruits; and also the priesthood of Aaron and the Levites, and the holy garments of Aaron and his sons; and, moreover, all the statutes and judgments relating to their worship and life.<p> </p><p>[3] Now because Divine things manifest themselves in the world in correspondences, therefore, the Word was written by pure correspondences. Therefore, also the Lord, since He spoke from His Divine, spoke by correspondences. For whatever proceeds from the Divine manifests itself in nature in such things as correspond to what is Divine; and these things then have stored up within them Divine things called celestial and spiritual. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 20</h4><p>20. iv. Hitherto the spiritual sense of the Word has been unknown. It has been shown in the work Heaven and Hell (n. <a href="../hh/87.htm">87-105</a>) that all things of nature, and likewise of the human body, and also every single particular in them, correspond to spiritual things. Hitherto, however, it has not been known what correspondence is, although in the most ancient times this was very well known; for the science of correspondences was then the science of sciences, and was so universal that all the writings and books were written by means of correspondences.</p><p>[2] The book of Job, which is an ancient book, is full of correspondences. The hieroglyphics of the Egyptians, and also the fabulous stories of highest antiquity, were nothing but correspondences. All the ancient churches were churches representative of heavenly things; their rites, and also the ordinances according to which their worship was instituted, consisted exclusively of correspondences. So did all things of the church among the sons of Jacob; their burnt-offerings and sacrifices, with each and every thing thereto pertaining, were correspondences; so was the Tabernacle with all its contents; so were their feasts, the feast of unleavened things, the feast of Tabernacles, and the feast of first-fruits; so was the priesthood of Aaron and the Levites, and also the holy garments of Aaron and his sons; besides all the ordinances and judgments that concerned their worship and their life.</p><p>[3] And as Divine things present themselves in the world by correspondences, the Word has been written exclusively by means of them. And therefore the Lord spoke by correspondences, because He spoke from His Divine, for that which is from the Divine, descending into nature, is turned into such things as correspond to Divine things, and which then store up and conceal in their bosom the Divine things that are called celestial and spiritual. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 20 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>20. (iv.) Quod Sensus Spiritualis Verbi hactenus ignotus fuerit.- Quod omnia et singula quae in natura sunt, correspondeant spiritualibus, similiter omnia et singula quae in corpore Humano, ostensum est in opere De Caelo et Inferno (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_20/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_87">De Caelo et Inferno 87-105</a>): sed quid correspondentia, hactenus nescitum est; verum in antiquissimis temporibus, notissima fuit, illis enim, qui tunc vixerunt, fuit scientia correspondentiarum scientia scientiarum, et tam universalis ut omnes illorum codices et libri per correspondentias scripti sint. Liber Hiobi, qui est liber antiquus, correspondentiis plenus est. Hieroglyphica Aegyptiorum, et quoque fabulosa vetustissimorum, non alia fuerunt. Omnes ecclesiae antiquae fuerunt ecclesiae repraesentativae caelestium; ritus illarum, et quoque statuta, secundum quae institutus fuit cultus illarum, constabant ex meris correspondentiis. Similiter omnia ecclesiae apud filios Jacobi. Holocausta et sacrificia, cum singulis illorum, correspondentiae fuerunt; similiter tabernaculum cum omnibus inibi; tum etiam festa illorum, ut festum azymorum, festum tabernaculorum, et festum primitiarum; etiam sacerdotium Aharonis et Levitarum, ut et vestes sanctitatis Aharonis et filiorum ejus; et praeterea omnia statuta et judicia, quae cultum et vitam illorum concernebant: et quia Divina in mundo se sistunt per correspondentias, ideo Verbum per meras correspondentias scriptum est; quare Dominus, quia locutus est ex Divino suo, locutus est per correspondentias; nam quod a Divino est, hoc in natura cadit in talia quae Divinis correspondent, et quae tunc Divina, quae vocantur caelestia et spiritualia, in sinu suo recondunt. </p>
