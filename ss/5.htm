<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第5节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">二、圣言包含一个灵义，迄今不为人知</h4><p>这个主题需要按下列顺序来阐明：</p>
<p>（a）什么是灵义？</p>
<p>（b）这灵义就在圣言的一切事物和每个细节中。</p>
<p>（c）这灵义使得圣言成为神启，并在每句话上都是神圣的。</p>
<p>（d）这灵义至今不为人知。</p>
<p>（e）从今以后，这灵义只赐给那些专注于来自主的纯正真理之人。</p>
<p>SS5.（a）什么是灵义？圣言的灵义不是当一个人为了确认教会的某个信条而研究和解释圣言时，从圣言字义闪耀出来的那层含义。这种含义是圣言的字义。灵义不显明在字义中，而是在字义里面，如同灵魂在身体里面，思维在眼睛里面，或情感在面部表情里面，二者就像原因和结果那样行如一体（AC1884，1885节）。正是这灵义使得圣言不仅对世人，而且对天使来说都是属灵的；所以，圣言通过灵义与天堂交流。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 5</h4>
<p>5. 1. What the spiritual meaning is. The spiritual meaning is not the meaning that shines forth from the Word's literal meaning when we study and interpret the Word in order to confirm some dogma of the church. That meaning is the literal meaning of the Word.
<p>We cannot see the spiritual meaning in the literal meaning; it is within the literal meaning the same way the soul is within the body, thought is within the eyes, or a feeling is within a facial expression - the two act together as cause and effect. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1884.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1884</a>, [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/1885.htm">1885</a>,]
<p>It is primarily this meaning that makes the Word spiritual not only for us but for angels as well; so by means of this meaning the Word is in communication with the heavens. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 5</h4><p>5. 1. What the spiritual meaning is. The spiritual meaning is not the sense that shines from the literal one when one is studying the Word and interpreting it in order to confirm some dogma of the church. This sense is the Word’s literal sense. Rather its spiritual meaning is one not apparent in the literal one. The spiritual meaning lies within the literal one, like the soul within the body, like thought within the eyes, and affection within the face, which operate in concert, like cause and effect.<p>That spiritual meaning is what principally causes the Word to be spiritual, not only for people, but also for angels. Consequently that meaning is the means by which the Word communicates with the heavens. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 5</h4><p>5. II. In the Word there is a spiritual sense, hitherto unknown.<p>The following points will be explained in this order: <p>1. What the spiritual sense is. <p>2. This sense is in the whole of the Word, and in every part of it. <p>3. Because of this sense the Word is Divinely inspired, and holy in every word. <p>4. This sense has hitherto been unknown. <p>5. Henceforth it will be made known only to those who are in genuine truths from the Lord. <p>1. WHAT THE SPIRITUAL SENSE IS. The spiritual sense is not that which shines forth from the sense of the Letter of the Word when one searches the Word and explains it to confirm some dogma of the Church: this sense is the literal sense of the Word. The spiritual sense, however, does not appear in the sense of the Letter: it is within it, as the soul is in the body, as the thought is in the eyes, and as affection is in the countenance; and these act together as cause and effect. It is this sense especially that makes the Word spiritual, not only for men but also for angels; and therefore the Word by means of this sense communicates with the heavens. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 5</h4><p>5. II. IN THE WORD THERE IS A SPIRITUAL SENSE, HITHERTO UNKNOWN<p>This subject shall be considered in the following order:<p>i. What the spiritual sense is.<p>ii. This sense is in all things of the Word and in every single particular of it.<p>iii. From this sense it is that the Word is Divinely inspired, and is holy in every word.<p>iv. Hitherto this sense has been unknown.<p>v. Henceforth it will be imparted solely to him who from the Lord is in genuine truths.<p>i. What the spiritual sense is. The spiritual sense of the Word is not that sense which shines forth from the sense of the letter while one is studying and unfolding the meaning of the Word with intent to confirm some tenet of the church. This is the literal sense of the Word. The spiritual sense does not appear in the sense of the letter, being within it as the soul in the body, as thought in the eyes, and as affection in the face, which act as a one, like cause and effect. It is this sense chiefly which renders the Word spiritual, not for men only, but for angels also; and therefore by means of this sense the Word gives communication with the heavens. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 5 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>5. (II.) QUOD IN VERBO SENSUS SPIRITUALIS SIT, HACTENUS IGNOTUS. <p>Haec in hoc ordine dicenda sunt: <p>(i.) Quid Sensus Spiritualis. <p>(ii.) Quod ille Sensus in omnibus et singulis Verbi sit. <p>(iii.) Quod ex illo sit, quod Verbum Divinitus inspiratum sit, ac in omni voce Sanctum. <p>(iv.) Quod ille Sensus hactenus ignotus fuerit. <p>(v.) Et quod non alicui posthac detur, nisi qui in genuinis veris a Domino est. <p>(i.) Quid Sensus Spiritualis. --Sensus spiritualis non est ille qui ex sensu litterae Verbi elucet, quando quis scrutatur et explicat Verbum ad confirmandum ecclesiae quoddam dogma; hic sensus est sensus Verbi litteralis. Sed sensus spiritualis non apparet in sensu litterae; est intus in illo, sicut anima in corpore, sicut cogitatio in oculis, et affectio in facie, quae unum agunt ut causa et effectus. Ille sensus imprimis facit ut Verbum sit spirituale, non modo pro hominibus, sed etiam pro angelis; quare Verbum per illum sensum communicat cum caelis. </p>
