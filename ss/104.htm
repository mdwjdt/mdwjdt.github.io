<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 104</h4>
<p>104. By Means of the Word, There Is Light Even for People Who Are outside the Church and Do Not Have the Word
<p>THERE can be no union with heaven unless somewhere on our planet there is a church where the Word is present and the Lord is known by means of it. This is because the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and there is no salvation apart from the Lord.
<p>It is adequate if there is simply a church where the Word is present even though that church may consist of relatively few people. Even so, by means of it the Lord is present everywhere in the whole world, because by means of it heaven is united with the human race. As for the union being by means of the Word, see <a href="../ss/62.htm">62-69</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 104</h4><p>104. The Word Is the Means by Which Those Have Light Who Are Outside the Church and Do Not Have the Word<p>No conjunction with heaven is possible unless somewhere on earth there is a church which has the Word and where the Lord is consequently known, because the Lord is God of heaven and earth, and there is no salvation apart from the Lord.<p>It is enough for a church to exist that has the Word, even if it consists of relatively few people. The Lord is still everywhere present by means of the Word throughout the whole world; for by it heaven is conjoined with the human race. To be shown that the conjunction exists by means of the Word, see nos. <a href="../ss/62.htm">62-69</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 104</h4><p>104. XIII. By means of the Word those also have light who are outside the Church, and do not possess the Word. <p>There cannot be conjunction with heaven unless there exists somewhere on the earth a Church in possession of the Word by means of which the Lord is known; for the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and without Him there is no salvation. it is enough that there is a Church in possession of the Word, even although it should consist of comparatively few persons; nevertheless, by means of the Word the Lord is present throughout the whole world, for it is the means by which conjunction is effected between heaven and the human race. Conjunction is by means of the Word, as may be seen above in Nos. <a href="../ss/62.htm">62-69</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 104</h4><p>104. XIII. THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE CHURCH WHO ARE NOT IN POSSESSION OF THE WORD HAVE LIGHT BY ITS MEANS<p>There can be no conjunction with heaven unless somewhere on earth there is a church where the Word is, and where by it the Lord is known; for the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and apart from Him there is no salvation. It is sufficient that there be a church where the Word is, even if it consists of comparatively few, for even in that case the Lord is present by its means in the whole world, for by its means heaven is conjoined with the human race. That there is conjunction by means of the Word may be seen above (n. <a href="../ss/62.htm">62-69</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 104 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>104. (XIII.) QUOD PER VERBUM ETIAM SIT LUX ILLIS QUI EXTRA ECCLESIAM SUNT, ET NON HABENT VERBUM. <p>Non potest, dari conjunctio cum caelo, nisi alicubi in tellure sit ecclesia, ubi est Verbum, et per id Dominus notus; quia Dominus est Deus caeli et terrae, et absque Domino nulla salus. Satis est, ut ecclesia sit, ubi Verbum, tametsi illa consistit ex paucis respective: per id usque Dominus praesens est ubivis in universo terrarum orbe, nam per id caelum conjunctum est humano generi; quod conjunctio sit per Verbum, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_104/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_62">62-69</a>). </p>
