<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS63.字义之所以使得与天堂天使的联系成为可能，是因为属灵和属天意义在字义里面，而天使在属灵和属天意义里面，属灵国度的天使在圣言的属灵意义里面，属天国度的天使在圣言的属天意义里面。当一个真正的人专心于属世意义，就是字义时，属灵和属天意义就从这层意义演变出来；这种演变是瞬间的；因此，联系也是瞬间的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 63</h4>
<p>63. The reason we have companionship with angels of heaven through the literal meaning is that within the literal meaning there are spiritual and heavenly levels of meaning, and those levels are the ones on which angels are focused. Angels of the spiritual kingdom focus on the spiritual meaning of the Word and angels of the heavenly kingdom focus on the heavenly meaning. These meanings unfold from the earthly meaning of the Word, which is the literal meaning, when anyone who has become truly human is absorbed in it. The unfolding is instantaneous, so the companionship is as well. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 63</h4><p>63. The literal sense makes possible an affiliation with angels in heaven because that sense has in it a spiritual sense and a celestial sense, and these are the senses that angels know — angels in the spiritual kingdom having the Word’s spiritual sense, and angels in the celestial kingdom having its celestial sense. These senses unfold from the Word’s natural sense, namely its literal sense, when a sincere person is intent on it. The unfolding is instantaneous, and accordingly also the affiliation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 63</h4><p>63. There is association with angels by means of the sense of the Letter because within that sense there are the spiritual and the celestial senses, and the angels are in those senses; the angels of the spiritual kingdom are in the spiritual sense of the Word, and the angels of the celestial are in its celestial sense. These senses are unfolded from the natural sense of the Word, which is the sense of the Letter, when a man principled in truth is in that sense. This unfolding is instantaneous, and thus also is his association [with angels]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 63</h4><p>63. The reason why there is association with the angels of heaven by means of the sense of the letter is that the spiritual sense and celestial sense are in it, and the angels are in these senses, the angels of the spiritual kingdom being in the Word's spiritual sense, and those of the celestial kingdom in its celestial sense. These senses are evolved from the Word's natural sense which is the sense of the letter while a true man is in it. The evolution is instantaneous; consequently so is the association. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 63 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>63. Quod per sensum litterae sit consociatio cum angelis caeli, est quia illi sensui inest sensus spiritualis et sensus caelestis, et in his sensibus sunt angeli; angeli regni spiritualis sensu spirituali Verbi, et angeli regni caelestis in sensu caelesti ejus, Hi sensus evolvuntur ex sensu naturali Verbi, qui est sensus litterae, dum homo verus in illo est. Evolutio est instantanea; proinde etiam consociatio. </p>
