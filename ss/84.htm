<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第84节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS84.阅读圣言的人若注意到这个问题，可能会发现圣言里面有一些成双成对的词语看似在重复同一件事，如：弟兄和同伴，贫穷和穷乏，荒废和荒凉，空虚和混沌，仇敌和敌人，罪恶和罪孽，怒气和忿怒，民族和人民或百姓，欢喜和快乐，哀号和哭泣，公义和公平等等。这些词看上去是同义词，其实并不是，因为弟兄、贫穷、荒废、空虚、仇敌、罪恶、怒气、民族、欢喜、哀号、公义等词论及良善，在反面意义上论及邪恶；而同伴、穷乏、荒凉、混沌、敌人、罪孽、忿怒、人民或百姓、快乐、哭泣、公平等词论及真理，在反面意义上论及虚假。在不了解这个秘密的读者看来，贫穷和穷乏，荒废和荒凉，空虚和混沌，仇敌和敌人似乎是一回事；罪恶和罪孽，怒气和忿怒，民族和人民或百姓，欢喜和快乐，哀号和哭泣，公义和公平也一样；然而，它们不是一回事，但却通过结合而成为一回事。</p>
<p>在圣言中，还有许多词是成双成对的，如：火和火焰、金和银、铜和铁、木和石、饼和水、饼和酒、紫色布和细麻布等等；这是因为火、金、铜、木、饼和紫色表示良善；而火焰、银、铁、石、水、酒和细麻布表示真理。经上以同样的方式说，人们要用全部的心和全部的灵魂来爱神；神要在人里面造一个新心和一个新灵；因为“心”论及爱之良善，“灵魂”论及来自良善的真理。也有些词是单独作用，不与其它任何词组合，因为它们与良善和真理这两者都有关。不过，这些和其它许多词只向天使和那些处于属世意义的同时，也处于属灵意义的人显明。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 84</h4>
<p>84. It can seem to readers who pay attention to such things that there are paired expressions in the Word that seem to be repetitions of the same thing - brother and companion, for example, poor and needy, waste and desolation, emptiness and void, enemy and foe, sin and iniquity, wrath and rage, nation and people, joy and gladness, grief and tears, justice and judgment, and the like. They do seem to be synonyms, but they are not, since brother, poor, waste, [emptiness,] enemy, sin, wrath, nation, joy, grief, and justice describe what is good (or in an opposite sense, what is evil), while companion, needy, desolation, void, foe, iniquity, rage, people, gladness, tears, and judgment describe what is true (or in an opposite sense, what is false). It seems to a reader who is unfamiliar with this mystery that poor and needy, waste and desolation, emptiness and void, enemy and foe are the same thing, as are sin and iniquity, wrath and rage, nation and people, joy and gladness, grief and tears, justice and judgment; yet they are not the same thing. Rather they become one thing by being brought together.</p>
<p>[2] Many other things are paired in the Word, like fire and flame, gold and silver, bronze and iron, wood and stone, bread and water, bread and wine, purple and linen, and so on, and this is because fire, gold, bronze, wood, bread, and purple mean something good, while flame, silver, iron, stone, water, wine, and linen mean something true. In the same vein, it says that we are to love God with our whole heart and our whole soul and that God is going to create in us a new heart and a new spirit, “heart” describing the good that comes from love and “soul” the truth that comes from that good.
<p>There are also expressions that occur alone with nothing appended because they designate both goodness and truth. These and many other expressions, though, are evident only to angels and to people who are aware of the spiritual meaning even while they are focused on the earthly meaning. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 84</h4><p>84. Readers who pay attention to it can see that we find in the Word paired expressions which seem to be repetitious of the same idea, such as brother and companion, poor and needy, devastation and desolation, empty and void, adversary and enemy, sin and iniquity, anger and wrath, nation and people, joy and gladness, mourning and weeping, justice (or righteousness) and judgment, and so on. These pairs seem to be synonyms, but in fact they are not, for the words brother, poor, devastation, empty, adversary, sin, anger, nation, joy, mourning, and justice (or righteousness) refer to goodness, and in an opposite sense to evil, whereas the words companion, needy, desolation, void, enemy, iniquity, wrath, people, gladness, weeping, and judgment refer to truth, and in an opposite sense to falsity. Still, it seems to the reader who does not know this arcanum that brother and companion, poor and needy, devastation and desolation, empty and void, and adversary and enemy have the same meaning, and likewise sin and iniquity, anger and wrath, nation and people, joy and gladness, mourning and weeping, justice (or righteousness) and judgment. And yet these do not have the same meaning, but by their combination come to have a united one.</p><p>[2] We find in the Word many other combinations as well, such as fire and flame, gold and silver, bronze and iron, wood and stone, bread and water, bread and wine, purple and fine linen, and so on, and this because fire, gold, bronze, wood, bread, and purple symbolize goodness, while flame, silver, iron, stone, water, wine and fine linen symbolize truth.<p>Similarly we are told that people are to love God with all their heart and with all their soul, and that God will create in a person a new heart and a new spirit. For the heart refers to the goodness of love, and the soul to truth springing from that goodness.<p>We also find words which, because they have to do with both goodness and truth, are used alone without being combined with any others.<p>But nothing of what we have said, and still more, is apparent except to angels, and to those who, when attending to the natural sense, attend also to the spiritual sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 84</h4><p>84. Those who read the Word attentively cannot help noticing the use of double expressions which seem like repetitions of the same thing; as for instance, brother [and companion, poor] and needy, wilderness and desert, void and emptiness, foe and enemy, sin and iniquity, anger and wrath, nation and people, joy and gladness, mourning and weeping, justice <sup>1</sup>(or righteousness) and judgment, and so on. These appear to be synonymous expressions, when in fact they are not. For the words brother, poor, wilderness, [void], foe, sin, anger, nation, joy, mourning and justice are used with reference to good, and in the opposite sense, to evil; while the words companion, needy, desert, emptiness, enemy, iniquity, wrath, people, gladness, weeping and judgment are used with reference to truth, and in the opposite sense, to falsity. Yet it seems to the reader who is ignorant of the truth involved that poor and needy, wilderness and desert, void and emptiness, foe and enemy, are one and the same thing; likewise sin and iniquity, anger and wrath, nation and people, joy and gladness, mourning and weeping, justice and judgment; whereas they are not one, but become one by conjunction. <p>In the Word also many other things are closely associated, as fire and flame, gold and silver, brass and iron, wood and stone, bread and water, bread and wine, purple and fine linen, and so on. This is because fire, gold, brass, wood, bread and purple signify good, while flame, silver, iron, stone, water, wine and fine linen signify truth. In like manner it is said that men should love God with all the heart and with all the soul; and also that God will create in man a new heart and a new spirit, for heart is used with reference to the good of love, and soul, of truth from that good. There are moreover some expressions which, because they partake of both good and truth, are used by themselves without the addition of others; but these and many other things are evident only to the angels, and to those who, while they perceive the natural sense, understand also the spiritual sense.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;Justice, righteousness: Both these words are used, as in the A.V., to render the Latin word Justitia. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 84</h4><p>84. Readers of the Word who pay attention to the matter can see that there are pairs of expressions in it that appear like repetitions of the same thing, such as "brother" [and "companion," "poor"] and "needy," "waste" and "solitude," "vacuity" and "emptiness," "foe" and "enemy," "sin" and "iniquity," "anger" and "wrath," "nation" and "people," "joy" and "gladness," "mourning" and "weeping," "righteousness" and "judgment," etc. These expressions appear synonymous but are not so, for "brother," "poor," "waste," ["vacuity,"] "foe," "sin," "anger," "nation," "joy," "mourning," and "righteousness" are predicated of good, and in the opposite sense of evil; whereas "companion," "needy," "solitude," "emptiness," "enemy," "iniquity," "wrath," "people," "gladness," "weeping," and "judgment" are predicated of truth, and in the opposite sense of falsity. And yet it seems to a reader who is not acquainted with this secret, that "poor" and "needy," "waste" and "solitude," "vacuity" and " emptiness," "foe" and "enemy," are one and the same thing; and in like manner "sin" and "iniquity," "anger" and "wrath," "nation" and "people," "joy" and "gladness," "mourning" and "weeping," "righteousness" and "judgment"; and yet they are not one thing, but become one thing by conjunction. Many things are also joined together in the Word, such as "fire" and "flame," "gold" and "silver," "brass" and "iron," "wood" and "stone," "bread" and "water," "bread" and "wine," "bright crimson" and "fine linen," etc., which is done because "fire," "gold," "brass," "wood," "bread," and "bright crimson" signify good; and "flame," "silver," "iron," "stone," "water," "wine," and "fine-linen" signify truth. And in the same way it is said that men are to "love God with all the heart and with all the soul"; and that God will "create in a man a new heart and a new spirit"; for "heart" is predicated of the good of love, and "soul" of the truth from that good. There are also words that are used alone, or without a mate, because they partake of both good and truth. But these and many other things are not apparent except to the angels, and to those also who while in the natural sense are also in the spiritual sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 84 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>84. Quod in Verbo sint binae expressiones, quae apparent sicut repetitiones ejusdem rei, a legentibus, qui ad id attendunt, potest videri; ut frater (et socius, pauper) et egenus, vastitas et solitudo, vacuitas et inanitas, hostis et inimicus, peccatum et iniquitas, ira et excandescentia, gens et populus, gaudium et laetitia, luctus et lacrymatio, justitia et judicium, etc.; quae apparent sicut synonyma, cum tamen usque non sunt; nam frater, pauper, vastitas, (vacuitas,) hostis, peccatum, ira, gens, gaudium, luctus, justitia, praedicantur de bono, et in opposito sensu de malo; at socius, egenus, solitudo, inanitas, inimicus, iniquitas, excandescentia, populus, laetitia, lacrymatio, judicium, praedicantur de vero, et in opposito sensu de falso: et tamen apparet legenti, qui hoc arcanum non novit, quod pauper et egenus, vastitas et solitudo, vacuitas et inanitas, hostis et inimicus, una res sint; similiter peccatum et iniquitas, ira et excandescentia, gens et populus gaudium et laetitia, luctus et lacrymatio, justitia et judicium; et tamen non una res sunt, sed una res fiunt per conjunctionem. In Verbo etiam conjunguntur plura; ut ignis et flamma, aurum et argentum, aes et ferrum, lignum et lapis, panis et aqua, panis et vinum, purpura et byssus, etc.; et hoc, quia ignis, aurum, aes, lignum, panis, purpura, significant bonum, ac flamma, argentum, ferrum, lapis, aqua, vinum, et byssus, sic, significant verum: similiter, quod dicatur quod amaturi sint Deum "ex toto corde et ex tota anima," tum quod Deus creaturus sit in homine "novum cor et novum spiritum;" cor enim praedicatur de bono amoris, anima de vero ex illo bono. Sunt etiam voces, quae quia de utroque tam bono quam vero participant, solitarie absque adjunctis aliis dicuntur; sed haec, et plura alia, non exstant nisi coram angelis, et coram illis, qui, dum in sensu naturali, etiam in sensu spirituali sunt. </p>
