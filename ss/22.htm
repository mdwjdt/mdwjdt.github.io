<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS22.但随着时间推移，教会的代表性事物，也就是对应，转化成偶像崇拜，以及巫术。当这种事发生时，按照主的圣治，对应的知识逐渐从记忆中被抹去，在以色列和犹太人当中则完全丧失并灭绝。这个民族的敬拜的确纯由对应构成，因而是天上事物的代表；但他们不知道它们表示什么。事实上，他们完全是属世人，因此既不愿，也不能知道关于属灵事物，因而关于对应的任何事。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 22</h4>
<p>22. With the passage of time, though, the symbolic practices of the church, which were correspondences, were turned into idolatrous practices and even into magic. When this happened, the Lord’s divine providence saw to it that this knowledge was gradually erased, and among the people of Israel and Judah it became utterly lost and extinct.
<p>The worship of those people, though, was still composed entirely of correspondences, so it represented heavenly realities even though they did not know what they meant. They were in fact completely earthly people and therefore neither wanted to know nor could know anything about spiritual things or, consequently, about correspondences. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 22</h4><p>22. In the process of time, however, the representative forms of the church, which were correspondent forms, were turned into idolatrous ones, and also into magical ones, and of the Lord’s Divine providence a knowledge of correspondences was then gradually obliterated, and in the Israelite and Jewish nation totally lost and extinguished.<p>The worship of the latter church did indeed consist of nothing but correspondent forms, and so was representative of things having to do with heaven; but still the people did not know what anything symbolized. For they were an entirely natural people, and so were neither willing nor able to know anything of spiritual matters, nor anything therefore of correspondences. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 22</h4><p>22. When, however, in the course of time the representative things of the Church, which were correspondences, were turned into idolatry and also into magic, by the Divine Providence of the Lord the science of correspondences was gradually obliterated, and amongst the Israelitish and Jewish nation was completely lost and became extinct. The worship of that nation consisted indeed of pure correspondences, and consequently was representative of heavenly things; but the people themselves did not understand the representation of a single thing. For they were altogether natural men, and therefore they did not wish, nor indeed were they able, to know anything of spiritual things, nor, therefore, anything of correspondences. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 22</h4><p>22. But when in process of time the representative things of the church, which were correspondences, were converted into things idolatrous and also into magic, then of the Lord's Divine Providence the knowledge of correspondences was gradually blotted out of remembrance, and among the Israelitish and Jewish people was altogether lost and annihilated. The worship of that nation did indeed consist exclusively of correspondences, and was consequently representative of heavenly things; but still they did not know what anything of it signified, for they were utterly natural men, and therefore were neither willing nor able to know anything about spiritual things, nor consequently about correspondences. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 22 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>22. Sed cum repraesentativa ecclesiae, quae erant correspondentiae, temporis tractu versa sunt in idololatrica, et quoque in magica, tunc illa scientia ex Divina Domini providentia successive obliterata est, et apud gentem Israeliticam et Judaicam prorsus deperdita et exstincta. Cultus quidem hujus gentis constabat ex meris correspondentiis, et inde erat ille repraesentativus caelestium; sed usque illi nesciebant quid aliquod significabat: erant enim prorsus naturales homines, et inde non scire volebant nec poterant aliquid de spiritualibus, proinde nec aliquid de correspondentiis. </p>
