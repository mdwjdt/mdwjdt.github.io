<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">九、圣言的每一个细节里面都有主与教会的一个婚姻，因而有良善与真理的一个婚姻</h4><p>SS80.迄今为止，没有人看到，圣言的每一个细节里面都有主与教会的一个婚姻，因而有良善与真理的一个婚姻；也没有人能看到这一点，因为圣言的灵义尚未揭开，没有灵义，不可能看到这婚姻。事实上，在圣言中，有两层意义，即属灵意义和属天意义，隐藏在字义里面。圣言中的事物在属灵意义上尤其涉及教会，在属天意义上尤其涉及主。它们也在属灵意义上涉及神性真理，在属天意义上神性良善。因此，这种婚姻可见于圣言的字义。然而，这种婚姻只向那些从圣言的属灵和属天意义知道词语和名字的含义之人显现，因为有些词语和名字论及良善，有些论及真理，有些则包括这两者；因此，不知道这一点，就不可能看出这种婚姻存在于圣言的细节里面。这就是为何这个秘密以前没有揭开的原因。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 80</h4>
<p>80. There Is a Marriage of the Lord and the Church in the Details of the Word and a Consequent Marriage of Goodness and Truth
<p>UNTIL the present time, no one has seen that there is a marriage of the Lord and the church in the details of the Word and a consequent marriage of goodness and truth, and no one could see it because the spiritual meaning of the Word had not been uncovered, and without this, the marriage cannot be seen.
<p>There are two levels of meaning in the Word that are hidden within the literal meaning, namely, a spiritual level and a heavenly level. Spiritually understood, the contents of the Word refer for the most part to the church, while understood on a heavenly level they refer for the most part to the Lord. On a spiritual level they also refer to divine truth and on a heavenly level they refer to divine goodness. As a result, this marriage is found in the literal meaning of the Word.
<p>However, this is not apparent to anyone who does not know the meanings of words and names on the basis of the spiritual and heavenly meanings of the Word, since some words and names focus attention on what is good and some on what is true, and some include both, so unless this is realized the marriage in the details of the Word cannot be seen. That is why this mystery has not been disclosed before. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 80</h4><p>80. Every Single Constituent of the Word Contains a Marriage of the Lord and the Church, and So a Marriage of Goodness and Truth<p>The idea that every single constituent of the Word contains a marriage of the Lord and the church, and so a marriage of goodness and truth, is something not seen previously, nor could it have been seen, because the Word’s spiritual sense was not disclosed before, and the marriage can only be seen by means of that sense. For lying concealed within the Word’s literal sense are two other senses, a spiritual one and a celestial one. In the spiritual sense expressions in the Word relate mainly to the church, and in the celestial sense, mainly to the Lord. In the spiritual sense they relate also to Divine truth, and in the celestial sense to Divine goodness. Hence the aforesaid marriage in the Word’s literal sense.<p>But this marriage is not apparent to anyone unless he knows from the Word’s spiritual and celestial senses the symbolic meanings of the words and names. For some words and names refer to goodness, and some to truth, and some encompass both. Without that knowledge, therefore, the aforesaid marriage in every constituent of the Word cannot be seen.<p>It is for this reason that this arcanum has not been disclosed previously. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 80</h4><p>80. IX. In every detail of the Word there is the marriage of the Lord and the Church, and consequently the marriage of good and truth.<p>Hitherto it has been not recognised that there is in every detail of the Word the marriage of the Lord and the Church, and consequently the marriage of good and truth; nor could it be seen, because the spiritual sense of the Word had not been revealed till now, and this sense alone can make this marriage evident. For there are two senses in the Word, called the spiritual and the celestial, concealed within the sense of the Letter; what belongs to the spiritual sense has special reference to the Church, and what belongs to the celestial sense, to the Lord. The content also of the spiritual sense has reference to Divine Truth, and the content of the celestial sense to Divine Good; and consequently there is in the sense of the Letter of the Word this marriage. However, this is apparent only to those who, from the spiritual and celestial senses of the Word, know the signification of words and names, some words and names being predicated of good, some of truth, and some including both references. Therefore without a knowledge of this signification, this marriage in every detail of the Word cannot be seen, and consequently this arcanum has not hitherto been discovered. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 80</h4><p>80. IX. THERE IS A MARRIAGE OF THE LORD AND THE CHURCH AND A DERIVATIVE MARRIAGE OF GOOD AND TRUTH IN EACH AND EVERY THING OF THE WORD<p>Hitherto this has not been seen, nor could it be seen, because the spiritual sense of the Word has not until now been disclosed, and it cannot be seen except by means of this sense. For in the Word two senses, the spiritual and the celestial, lie hidden within the sense of the letter. In the spiritual sense the things in the Word refer especially to the church, and in the celestial sense, especially to the Lord. In the spiritual sense they also refer to Divine truth, and in the celestial to Divine good. From this comes the marriage in question in the sense of the letter of the Word. But this appears to those only who know from the Word's spiritual and celestial sense the significations of the words and names, for some of these are predicated of good and some of truth, and some include both, so that without this knowledge the marriage that exists in each and every thing of the Word could not be seen. This is the reason why this secret has not been disclosed before. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 80 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>80. (IX.) QUOD IN SINGULIS VERBI SIT CONJUGIUM DOMINI ET ECCLESIAE, ET INDE CONJUGIUM BONI ET VERI. <p>Quod in singulis Verbi sit conjugium Domini et ecclesiae, et inde conjugium boni et veri, hactenus non visum est, nec videri potuit, quia sensus spiritualis Verbi non prius detectus est, et id non videri potest nisi per illum. Sunt enim bini sensus in Verbo, latentes in sensu litterae ejus, spiritualis et caelestis, In spirituali sensu se referunt illa quae in Verbo sunt, maxime ad ecclesiam; et in caelesti, maxime ad Dominum: tum in spirituali sensu se referunt illa ad Divinum Verum, et in caelesti ad Divinum Bonum. Inde est in sensu litterae Verbi illud conjugium. Sed hoc non apparet alicui, nisi qui ex sensu spirituali et caelesti Verbi scit vocum et nominum significationes; nam quaedam voces et nomina praedicantur de bono, et quaedam de vero, et quaedam includunt utrumque; quare absque illa cognitione, conjugium illud in singulis Verbi non videri potuit. Haec causa est, quod hoc arcanum non prius detectum fuerit. </p>
