<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS83.每个人都有两种生命官能，被称为理解力和意愿。理解力是接受真理、因而接受智慧的容器，意愿是接受良善、因而接受爱的容器。为叫一个人能成为教会的一部分，这两者必须合而为一；当这个人从纯正真理形成他的理解力，并且表面上看貌似凭他自己如此行时，当他的意愿充满爱之良善，并且这一切由主实现时，它们就合为一体。人由此而拥有一种真理的生命和一种良善的生命，真理的生命从意愿而在理解力中，良善的生命通过理解力而在意愿中。这就是一个人里面的真理与良善的婚姻，以及他里面的主与教会的婚姻。关于被称为一个婚姻的这种相互结合，详情可参看《圣治》，《圣爱与圣智》和《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 83</h4>
<p>83. Each of us has two faculties of life, called understanding and will. Our understanding receives what is true and therefore receives what is wise, and our will receives what is good and therefore receives love. These must become one if we are to be part of the church; and they do become one when we form our understanding from genuine truth, to all appearances doing this ourselves, and when our will is filled with a love for doing good, which is accomplished by the Lord. In this way we have a life of what is true and a life of what is good, the life of what is true in our understanding from our will and the life of what is good in our will by means of our understanding; and this is a marriage of truth and goodness for us and a marriage of the Lord and the church for us.
<p>But there is more on this mutual union, here called a marriage, in Angelic Wisdom about Divine Providence, [Angelic Wisdom] about Divine Love and Wisdom, and [Angelic Wisdom] about Life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 83</h4><p>83. Every person has in him two faculties of life, called intellect and will. The intellect is the recipient vessel of truth and so of wisdom, while the will is the recipient vessel of goodness and so of love. The two must be united for a person to be a person of the church, and they are united when a person forms his intellect out of genuine truths, and this to all appearance as though of himself, and when his will is filled with the goodness of love, this by the Lord. The person consequently has a life of truth and a life of goodness — a life of truth in the intellect impelled by the will, and a life of goodness in the will in consequence of the intellect. This union is the marriage of truth and goodness in the the person, and also the marriage of the Lord and the church in him.<p>But regarding this reciprocal union, which we here call a marriage, more will be seen in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Providence, Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom, and Regarding Life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 83</h4><p>83. There are two faculties of life in every man, the understanding and the will, the understanding being the receptacle of truth, and thence of wisdom, the will being the receptacle of good, and thence of love. These two faculties ought to make one, that a man may be a member of the Church; and they are united when a man forms his understanding from genuine truths, apparently of himself, and when his will is filled with the good of love, which is done by the Lord. In this way a man has the life of truth and the life of good, the life of truth in his understanding from the will, and the life of good in his will through the understanding. This is the marriage of truth and good with man, and also the marriage of the Lord and the Church in him. But concerning this reciprocal conjunction, here called a marriage, more will be seen in THE ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE, CONCERNING THE DIVINE LOVE AND DIVINE WISDOM, and CONCERNING LIFE. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 83</h4><p>83. With every man there are two faculties of life, called Understanding and Will. The understanding is the receptacle of truth and the derivative wisdom, and the will is the receptacle of good and the derivative love. For a man to be a man of the church these two must make a one, and this they do when the man forms his understanding from genuine truths, which to all appearance is done as by himself; and when his will is infilled with the good of love, which is done by the Lord. From this the man has a life of truth and a life of good, a life of truth in the understanding from the will, and a life of good in the will through the understanding. This is the marriage of truth and good in a man, and also the marriage of the Lord and the church in him. But concerning this reciprocal conjunction called a marriage, more will be seen in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Providence, Divine Love and Wisdom, and Doctrine of Life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 83 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>83. Sunt binae facultates vitae apud unumquemvis hominem, quae vocantur intellectus et voluntas. Intellectus est receptaculum veri, et inde sapientiae, et voluntas est receptaculum, boni et inde amoris. Haec unum facient, ut homo sit homo ecclesiae; ac unum faciunt dum homo intellectum format genuinis veris, et hoc fit ad apparentiam sicut ab illo, et dum voluntas ejus impletur bono amoris, hoc fit a Domino. Inde homini vita veri et vita boni est; vita veri in intellectu ex voluntate, et vita boni in voluntate per intellectum. Hoc est conjugium veri et boni apud hominem, tum conjugium Domini et ecclesiae apud illum. Sed de reciproca hac conjunctione, quae hic vocatur conjugium, in Sapientia Angelica de Divina Providentia, de Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia, et de Vita videbitur. </p>
