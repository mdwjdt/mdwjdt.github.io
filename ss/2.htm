<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第2节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS2.如此思考的人没有考虑到：耶和华自己，也就是天地之神，通过摩西和众先知说圣言，故圣言必是神性真理本身，因为耶和华自己所说的话不可能是别的。他们也没有考虑到：等同于耶和华的主在福音书中说话，其中大量的话出自祂自己的口，其余的出自祂口中的灵，也就是圣灵。这就是为何祂说，祂的话里面有生命（约翰福音6:63），祂就是那照亮人的光（约翰福音1:9），祂就是真理（约翰福音14:6）。</p>
<p>《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》一书（52-53节）已说明，耶和华自己通过众先知说圣言。主自己在福音书中所说的话就是生命，对此，可参看约翰福音：</p>
<p>我对你们所说的话就是灵，就是生命。（约翰福音6:63）</p>
<p>耶稣对雅各井旁的妇人说：</p>
<p>你若知道神的恩赐，和对你说给我水喝的是谁，你必早求祂，祂也必早给了你活水。人若喝我所赐他的水就永远不渴，我所赐他的水要在他里头成为水泉，直涌到永生。（约翰福音4:6，10，14）</p>
<p>“雅各井”表示圣言，申命记（33:28）中的也是，这就是为何主坐在那里与那妇人交谈。“水”表示圣言中的真理。</p>
<p></p>
<p>人若渴了，可以到我这里来喝。信我的人就如经上所说、从他腹中要流出活水的江河来。（约翰福音7:37-38）</p>
<p></p>
<p>彼得对耶稣说，你有永生的话语。（约翰福音6:68）</p>
<p>所以主在马可福音中说：</p>
<p>天地要废去，我的话却不能废去。（马可福音13:31）</p>
<p>主的话之所以是“生命”，是因为祂自己就是“生命”，就是“真理”，如祂在约翰福音中所教导的：</p>
<p>我就是道路、真理、生命。（约翰福音14:6）</p>
<p></p>
<p>太初有圣言，圣言与神同在，圣言就是神。生命在祂里头，这生命就是人的光。（约翰福音1:1，4）</p>
<p>“圣言”在此表示神性真理方面的主，唯独神性真理里面有生命和光。</p>
<p>这就是为何来自主并且就是主的圣言被称为：</p>
<p>活水的泉源。（耶利米书2:13；17:13；31:9）</p>
<p>救恩的泉源。（以赛亚书12:3）</p>
<p>泉源。（撒迦利亚书13:1）</p>
<p>生命水的河。（启示录22:1）</p>
<p>这也是为何经上说：</p>
<p>宝座中间的羔羊必牧养他们，领他们到生命水的泉源。（启示录7:17）</p>
<p>在其它一些经文中，圣言被称为主与人同住的“圣所”和“帐幕”。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 2</h4>
<p>2. People who think like this, though, are not taking into account the fact that Jehovah himself, who is the God of heaven and earth, spoke the Word through Moses and the prophets, so the Word can be nothing but divine truth itself, because what Jehovah himself says is exactly that. They are also not taking into account the fact that the Lord (who is the same as Jehovah) spoke the Word with the authors of the Gospels - much of it with his own mouth and the rest by means of the spirit of his mouth, which is the Holy Spirit. That is why he said that there was life in his words [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>], that he was the light that enlightens [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_9.htm">John 1:9</a>], and that he was the truth [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>].</p>
<p>[2] It is shown in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>)
<p>Again,
<p>Jesus said to the woman at Jacob’s well, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me something to drink, ’ you would ask of him and he would give you living water. Those who drink of the water that I will give will not thirst to eternity; the water that I will give them will become a fountain of water within them, springing up into eternal life.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_7.htm">John 4:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_13.htm">13-14</a>)
<p>Jacob’s well means the Word here, as it does also in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>, so that is why the Lord sat there and spoke with the woman; and its water means the truth of the Word.</p>
<p>[3] Again,
<p>Jesus said, “If any are thirsty, they must come to me and drink. As the Scripture says, from the bellies of those who believe in me will flow rivers of living water.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_7_37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>)
<p>Again,
<p>Peter said to Jesus, “You have the words of eternal life.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_68.htm">John 6:68</a>)
<p>So in Mark the Lord says,
<p>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_31.htm">Mark 13:31</a>)
<p>The reason the Lord’s words are life is that he himself is life and truth, as he tells us in John:
<p>I am the way, the truth, and the life. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>)
<p>And
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. In him there was life, and that life was the light for humankind. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>)
<p>In this passage “the Word” means the Lord as divine truth, in which alone there is life and light.</p>
<p>[4] That is why the Word, which comes from the Lord and which is the Lord, is called “a fountain of living waters” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_2_13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_17_13.htm">17:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_9.htm">31:9</a>); “a fountain of salvation” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_12_3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>); “a fountain” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_13_1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a>); and “a river of water of life” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>). It is also why it says that “the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to living fountains of waters” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_7_17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>).
<p>There are passages as well where the Word is called a sanctuary and a tabernacle where the Lord dwells with us. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 2</h4><p>2. Someone who thinks in this way, however, does not reflect that Jehovah Himself, the God of heaven and earth, spoke the Word through Moses and the prophets, and that it must therefore be Divine truth itself. For whatever Jehovah Himself utters is such truth. Nor does that person reflect that the Lord, who is the same as Jehovah, spoke the Word reported by the Gospel writers, much of it in person, and the rest by the breath of His mouth, which is the Holy Spirit. Consequently what He Himself says is, in His own words, life, and He is the light that enlightens, and truth personified.</p><p>[2] That Jehovah Himself spoke the Word through the prophets is something we showed in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>)<p>Again in John, Jesus said to the woman at Jacob’s spring:<p>If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, “Give Me a drink, ” you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.... Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_6.htm">John 4:6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_14.htm">14</a>)<p>Jacob’s spring symbolizes the Word, as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_33_28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a> as well. That, too, is why the Lord sat there and spoke with the woman. And the water symbolizes the Word’s truth.</p><p>[3] Again in John:<p>...Jesus...(said), “If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. Whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture says, out of his belly will flow rivers of living water.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_7_37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>)<p>And again:<p>...Peter (said to Jesus), “...You have the words of eternal life.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_68.htm">John 6:68</a>)<p>Therefore the Lord says in Mark:<p>Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_31.htm">Mark 13:31</a>)<p>The Lord’s words are life because He is the life and the truth, as He tells us in John:<p>I am the way, the truth, and the life. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>)<p>And again in John:<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word.... In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_4.htm">4</a>)<p>The Word there means the Lord in relation to Divine truth, in which alone there is life and light.</p><p>[4] It is on this account that the Word, being from the Lord and embodying the Lord, is called “a fountain of living waters” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_2_13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_17_13.htm">17:13</a>), “a fountain of salvation” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_12_3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>), “a fountain” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_13_1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a>). Also “a river of the water of life” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>). And we are told that “the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to living fountains of waters” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_7_17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>).<p>There are in addition many other places where the Word is called the sanctuary and the tabernacle in which the Lord dwells with mankind. </p>

Nor does he consider that the Lord, who is the same as Jehovah, spoke the Word written by the Evangelists, much of it from His own mouth, and the rest from the spirit of His mouth, which is the Holy Spirit.
