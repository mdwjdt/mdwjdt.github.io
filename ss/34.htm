<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS34.没有世人所在的世界，天使所在的天堂也是如此。人类是天堂的基础、容器和支撑；圣言在世人中间，就在他们里面。因为所有天堂都被划分为两个国度，称作属天国度和属灵国度。这两个国度都建立在世人生活于其中的属世国度之上。一种类似结构存在于圣言中，圣言在世人中间，就在他们里面。天使天堂被划分为两个国度，即属天国度和属灵国度（可参看《天堂与地狱》一书，20-28节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 34</h4>
<p>34. It would be the same for the heavens where angels live if it were not for the world where we live. We, as human beings, are their foundation, container, and support, and we have the Word with us and in us.
<p>Overall, the heavens are divided into two kingdoms, which are called the heavenly kingdom and the spiritual kingdom. These two kingdoms are founded upon the earthly kingdom where we live. A similar structure exists in the Word, which we have with us and in us.
<p>See <a href="../hh/20.htm">Heaven and Hell 20-28</a> on the division of the angelic heavens into two kingdoms, a heavenly one and a spiritual one. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 34</h4><p>34. The case would be the same with the heavens where angels dwell, without the world where people dwell. The human race is their foundation, containing vessel and buttress, the Word being both among people and within them. For the heavens are all divided into two kingdoms, called the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom. These two kingdoms rest on the natural kingdom inhabited by people. And so the case is likewise with the Word, which exists among people and within them.<p>That the angelic heavens have been distinguished into two kingdoms, celestial and spiritual, may be seen in the book <a href="../hh/20.htm">Heaven and Hell 20-28</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 34</h4><p>34. The case would be similar with the heavens where the angels are, without the world where men are. The human race is the basis, the containant and the support of the heavens; and the Word is with men and in them. For all the heavens are distinguished into two kingdoms, called the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom: and these two kingdoms are founded upon the natural kingdom in which men are: likewise also the Word, which is with men and in men. That the angelic heavens are distinguished into two kingdoms, the celestial and the spiritual, may be seen in the work on <a href="../hh/20.htm">HEAVEN AND HELL 20-28</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 34</h4><p>34. So would it be with the heavens where angels are, without the world where men are. The human race is the basis, containant, and support of the heavens; and the Word is among men and in them. For all the heavens have been discriminated into two kingdoms, called the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom; these two kingdoms are founded upon a natural kingdom, in which are men. And so therefore is it with the Word which is among men and in men. (That the angelic heavens have been discriminated into two kingdoms, the celestial, and the spiritual, may be seen in Heaven and Hell, n. <a href="../hh/20.htm">20-28</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 34 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>34. Simile foret cum caelis ubi sunt angeli, absque mundo ubi sunt homines: humanum genus est basis, continens et firmamentum illorum; et apud homines et in illis est Verbum. Omnes enim caeli distincti sunt in duo regna, quae vocantur regnum caeleste et regnum spirituale; haec duo regna fundantur super regno naturali, in quo sunt homines: similiter itaque Verbum, quod apud homines et in hominibus est. (Quod caeli angelici distincti sint in duo regna, caeleste et spirituale, videatur in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_34/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_20">De Caelo et Inferno 20-28</a>) </p>
