<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS100.很少有人明白主如何是圣言，因为人们认为主的确能通过圣言启示并教导世人，但这不是祂被称为圣言的理由。然而，要知道，每个人都是他自己的爱，因而是他自己的良善和自己的真理。一个人唯独由此而为一个人，他里面再没有别的为人的东西了。正是由于一个人是他自己的良善和自己的真理，天使和灵人才为人，因为从主发出的一切良善和真理在形式上都是人。主因是神性良善和神性真理本身，故为人，每个人都从祂而为一个人，或说祂是一切人性的源头。一切神性良善和神性真理在形式上都是人，这一点可见于《天堂与地狱》一书（460节），在即将推出的论述天使智慧的著作中会看得更清楚。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 100</h4>
<p>100. There are not many people who understand how the Lord is the Word. Yes, they do think that the Lord can enlighten and teach us through the Word, but they do not think that this warrants calling him “the Word.” Let them know, though, that each one of us is her or his own distinctive love and therefore that each of us is whatever we have that is good and that is true. That is all that makes us human, and nothing else in us is human.
<p>Every human being is her or his own goodness and truth. That is the reason why angels and spirits, too, are human - because everything good and true that emanates from the Lord is in its proper form human. The Lord, though, is divine goodness and divine truth itself, so he is the Human, the source of all our humanity.
<p>See <a href="../hh/460.htm">Heaven and Hell 460</a> on the human form of everything divinely good and divinely true. This will also be more clearly presented in forthcoming works that are to be about angelic wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 100</h4><p>100. In what way the Lord is the Word is something few people understand, for they think that it is possible indeed for the Lord to enlighten and teach a person by means of the Word, and yet not that He can for that reason be called the Word. But be it known that everyone embodies his own love, and so his own goodness and his own truth. A person would otherwise not be human, and nothing in him would be human.<p>It is because a person embodies his own goodness and own truth that angels and spirits are human. For every good and every truth emanating from the Lord is, in its form, human.<p>The Lord, however, is Divine goodness itself and Divine truth itself. Thus He is supremely human, on whose account every person is human.<p>That every Divine good and Divine truth is, in its form, human, may be seen in the book, <a href="../hh/460.htm">Heaven and Hell 460</a>. And it will be seen still more clearly in treatises to follow, which will have as their subject Angelic Wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 100</h4><p>100. Few understand how the Lord is the Word, for it is generally supposed that the Lord, by means of the Word, can enlighten and teach men, and yet He cannot, on this account, be called the Word. It should be known, however, that every man is his own love, and consequently his own good and his own truth. A man is a man for no other reason than this, and there is nothing else in him that is man. For the same reason that man is his own good and his own truth, angels and spirits also are men; and for all good and truth proceeding from the Lord, is in its own form, man. But the Lord is Divine Good itself and Divine Truth itself; thus He is Man Himself, from whom everyman is man. That all Divine Good and Divine Truth is, in its own form, man, may be seen in the work on <a href="../hh/460.htm">HEAVEN AND HELL 460</a>; and will appear more clearly in the works that are to follow, which will treat of Angelic Wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 100</h4><p>100. Few understand how the Lord is the Word, for they think that the Lord may indeed enlighten and teach men by means of the Word without His being on that account called the Word. Be it known however that every man is his own love, and consequently his own good and his own truth. It is solely from this that a man is a man, and there is nothing else in him that is man. It is from the fact that a man is his own good and his own truth that angels and spirits are men, for all the good and truth that proceeds from the Lord is in its form a man. And as the Lord is Divine good and Divine truth itself, He is the Man, from whom every man is a man. That all Divine good and Divine truth is in its form a man may be seen in Heaven and Hell (n. <a href="../hh/460.htm">460</a>), and more clearly in treatises that are to follow, on the subject of angelic wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 100 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>100. Quomodo Dominus est Verbum, a paucis intelligitur; cogitant enim quod Dominus quidem per Verbum potest hominem illustrare et docere, et tamen non inde potest vocari Verbum. At sciant quod unusquisque homo sit suus amor, et inde suum bonum et suum verum; homo non aliunde est homo, et non aliud apud illum est homo. Ex eo quod homo sit suum bonum et suum Verum, sunt etiam angeli et spiritus homines; nam omne bonum et verum procedens a Domino in sua forma est homo: Dominus autem est ipsum Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum; ita est ipse Homo, a quo omnis homo est homo. Quod omne Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum in sua forma sit Homo, videatur in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_100/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_460">De Caelo et Inferno 460</a>; et clarius videbitur in transactionibus sequentibus, quae erunt de Sapientia Angelica. </p>
