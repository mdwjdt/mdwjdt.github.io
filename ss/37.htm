<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 37</h4>
<p>37. Divine Truth, in All Its Fullness, Holiness, and Power, Is Present in the Literal Meaning of the Word
<p>THE reason the Word is in its fullness, holiness, and power in the literal meaning is that the two prior or deeper meanings that are called spiritual and heavenly are together in the earthly meaning, which is the literal meaning, as explained in <a href="../ss/31.htm">31</a> above. Now I need to state briefly how they are together. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 37</h4><p>37. In the Word’s Literal Sense, Divine Truth Is Present in Its Fullness, in Its Holiness, and in Its Power<p>In its literal sense the Word is in its fullness, in its holiness, and in its power, because, as we said in no. <a href="../ss/28.htm">28</a> above, the two prior or interior senses, called spiritual and celestial, are present at the same time in the natural sense, which is the literal sense. But how they are present at the same time — this we must now briefly explain. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 37</h4><p>37. IV. Divine Truth, in the sense of the Letter of the Word, is in its fulness, its sanctity, and its power.<p>The Word, in its sense of the Letter, is in its fulness, its sanctity, and its power, because the two prior or interior senses, called the spiritual and the celestial, are simultaneously in the natural sense, which is the sense of the Letter, as was said above, No. <a href="../ss/31.htm">31</a>; but how they are present simultaneously will now be told in a few words. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 37</h4><p>37. IV. DIVINE TRUTH IN THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORLD IS IN ITS FULLNESS, IN ITS HOLINESS, AND IN ITS POWER<p>The reason why the Word in the sense of the letter is in its fullness, in its holiness, and in its power, is that the two prior or interior senses, which are called the spiritual and the celestial, are together or simultaneous [sunt simul] in the natural sense, which is the sense of the letter, as was said above (n. <a href="../ss/28.htm">28</a>). But how they are simultaneous in that sense shall now be told in a few words. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 37 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>37. (IV.) QUOD DIVINUM VERUM IN SENSU LITTERAE VERBI, SIT IN SUO PLENO, IN SUO SANCTO, ET IN SUA POTENTIA. <p>Quod Verbum in suo sensu litterae sit in suo pleno, in suo sancto, et in sua potentia, est quia bini sensus priores seu interiores, qui vocantur spiritualis et caelestis, in sensu naturali, qui est sensus litterae, sunt simul, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_37/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_31">31</a>) <sup>1</sup>dictum est; sed quomodo sunt simul, paucis nunc dicetur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;n. 31 pro "n. 29" </p>
