<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第36节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS36.最外在或属世意义，就是字义上的圣言，还由构造为碧玉的圣耶路撒冷的城墙，各样宝石修饰的城墙的根基，以及珍珠的门来表示（启示录21:18-21）。这是因为“耶路撒冷”表示教义方面的教会。关于这些事，详情可见于下一章。综上所述，明显可知，圣言的字义，也就是属世意义，是它的内义，也就是属灵和属天意义的基础、容器和支撑。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 36</h4>
<p>36. The Word in its outermost or earthly meaning, which is its literal meaning, is also meant by the wall of the holy Jerusalem, which was made of jasper, by the foundations of the wall, which were precious stones, as well as by the gates, which were pearls (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_18.htm">Revelation 21:18-21</a>). This is because Jerusalem means the church in regard to its teachings. There will be more on this, though, under the next heading []. We may now conclude from what has been presented that the literal meaning of the Word, which is earthly, is the foundation, container, and support of its inner meanings, which are a spiritual meaning and a heavenly meaning. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 36</h4><p>36. In its outmost or natural sense, namely its literal sense, the Word is symbolized also by the wall of the Holy Jerusalem, whose construction was jasper; by the foundations of the wall, which were precious stones; and also by the gates, which were pearls (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_18.htm">Revelation 19:18-21</a>). For Jerusalem symbolizes the church in respect to doctrine. But more on this subject in the next section.<p>It can now be seen from what we have presented that the Word’s literal sense, which is its natural sense, is the foundation, containing vessel, and buttress of its interior senses, which are its spiritual and celestial senses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 36</h4><p>36. The Word in its ultimate or natural sense, which is the sense of its Letter, is also signified by the wall of the holy Jerusalem, the structure of which was jasper; and by the foundations of the wall, which were precious stones; and also by its gates, which were pearls, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_18.htm">Revelation 21:18-21</a>. For by Jerusalem is signified the Church as to doctrine. However, more will be said of these things in a subsequent article. From what has been stated it may now appear that the sense of the Letter of the Word, the natural sense, is the basis, the containant and the support of its interior senses, namely, the spiritual and the celestial senses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 36</h4><p>36. The Word in its ultimate or natural sense, which is the sense of the letter, is signified also by the wall of the Holy Jerusalem, the structure of which was of jasper; and by the foundations of the wall, which were precious stones; and likewise by the gates, which were pearls (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_18.htm">Revelation 21:18-21</a>); for Jerusalem signifies the church as to doctrine. But of these things more in the following chapter. From what has been adduced it is now evident that the sense of the letter of the Word, which is the natural sense, is the basis, container, and support of its interior senses, which are the spiritual and the celestial. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 36 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>36. Verbum in sensu ultimo seu naturali, qui est Sensus litterae ejus, significatur etiam per "murum sanctae Hierosolymae" cujus structura erat jaspis, perque "fundamenta muri" quae erant lapides pretiosi, tum etiam per "portas" quae erant margaritae (Apocalypsis 19:18-21 [NCBSP: <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_36/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_18-21">21:18-21</a>]); nam per "Hierosolymam" significatur ecclesia quoad doctrinam: sed de his plura in sequente articulo. Ex allatis nunc constare potest, quod sensus litterae Verbi, qui est naturalis, sit basis, continens, et firmamentum sensuum interiorum ejus, qui sunt sensus spiritualis et caelestis. </p>
