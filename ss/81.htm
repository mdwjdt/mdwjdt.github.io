<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS81.由于圣言的每一个细节里面都有这样一种婚姻，所以那里经常出现看似重复同一件事的成双成对的表达方式。然而，它们不是重复，因为其中一种表达方式涉及良善，另一种涉及真理，两者合在一起会产生良善与真理的一个结合，因而形成一个事物。这实际上是圣言的神性和神圣的基础，因为在神性的一切工作中，良善都与真理结合，真理都与良善结合。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 81</h4>
<p>81. Because this marriage is in the details of the Word, time and again there are paired expressions in the Word that seem to be saying the same thing twice. However, they are not mere repetitions. One focuses on what is good and the other on what is true, and their combination makes a union of the two and therefore a single thing. That is actually the basis of the divinity of the Word and of its holiness, since in every divine work goodness is united to truth and truth is united to goodness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 81</h4><p>81. Because every single constituent of the Word contains such a marriage, we find therefore many times in the Word paired expressions which seem to be repetitious of the same idea. They are, however, not repetitious, but one expression relates to goodness and the other to truth, and the two taken together produce a combination of them so as to form a single concept. This, too, is what accounts for the Divinity of the Word and its holiness; for present in every Divine work is goodness combined with truth, and truth combined with goodness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 81</h4><p>81. Since there exists such a marriage in every detail of the Word, therefore double expressions frequently occur in it, which seem like repetitions of the same thing. They are, however, not repetitions; but one relates to good and the other to truth, and when both are taken together they effect the conjunction of good and truth, and so combine them into one. This also is the ground of the Divinity and sanctity of the Word; for in every Divine work there is a conjunction of good with truth, and of truth with good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 81</h4><p>81. As there is such a marriage in each and every thing of the Word, there frequently occur in it two expressions that appear like repetitions of the same thing. They however are not repetitions, for one of them has reference to good and the other to truth, and both taken together effect a conjunction of good and truth, and thus form one thing. From this too comes the Divinity of the Word and its holiness, for in every Divine work good is conjoined with truth and truth with good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 81 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>81. Quia tale conjugium in singulis Verbi est, ideo multoties in Verbo sunt binae expressiones, quae apparent sicut repetitiones ejusdem rei; attamen non sunt repetitiones, sed una se refert ad bonum, et altera ad verum, et utraque simul sumpta facit conjunctionem illorum, ita , unam rem. Inde etiam est Divinitas Verbi, et Sanctitas ejus; nam in omni opere Divino est bonum conjunctum vero, et verum conjunctum bono. </p>
