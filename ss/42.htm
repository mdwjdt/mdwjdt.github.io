<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第42节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS42.由于在其最内层的核心处，圣言因其属天意义而像一团火焰，还由于在其居间层的核心处，圣言因其属灵意义而像光照人的一道光，所以可推知，在其最外层的核心处，圣言因其含有两层更内在的意义在里面的属世意义而像红宝石和钻石。它因其属天火焰而像红宝石，因其属灵之光而像钻石。由于圣言因其透明而在字义上具有这种性质，所以圣言的字义由下列事物来表示：新耶路撒冷城墙的根基（启示录21:14，19）；亚伦以弗得上的乌陵和土明（出埃及记28:30；利未记8:8）；推罗王所在的伊甸园（以西结书28:12-13）；会幕的幔子和帷帐（出埃及记26:1-13；36:8-17），以及耶路撒冷圣殿里面所修饰的表面（列王纪上6:7）。而在其本质荣耀中的圣言由变像时的主来表示（马太福音17:2；马可福音9:2）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 42</h4>
<p>42. Since at the heart of its inmost level our Word is like a flame that ignites us because of its heavenly meaning, and since at the heart of its intermediate level it is like a light that enlightens us because of its spiritual meaning, at the heart of its outermost level it is like a ruby and a diamond because of its earthly meaning, which contains both the deeper ones. It is like a ruby because of its heavenly flame and like a diamond because of its spiritual light.
<p>Since that is the nature of the Word in its literal meaning because of the way light shines through it, the Word’s literal meaning is meant by the foundations of the wall of Jerusalem [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_19.htm">19</a>], by the Urim and Thummim of Aaron’s breastplate [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_28_30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_8_8.htm">Leviticus 8:8</a>], by the Garden of Eden where the king of Tyre lived [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-13</a>], as well as by the curtains and veils of the tabernacle [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_26_1.htm">Exodus 26:1-13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_36_8.htm">36:8-17</a>] and the decorated surfaces inside the Jerusalem temple [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_6_7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a>]; while the Word in its essential glory is meant by the Lord when he was transfigured [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_9_2.htm">Mark 9:2</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 42</h4><p>42. Since our Word in its inmost embrace is, owing to its celestial sense, like a flame that kindles, and since in its intermediate embrace it is, owing to its spiritual sense, like a light that enlightens, therefore the Word in its outmost embrace is, owing to its natural sense and the two inner senses it contains, like a ruby and a diamond — like a ruby because of the celestial flame, and like a diamond because of the spiritual light.<p>Because that is the nature of the Word in its literal sense as regards its transparence, therefore the Word in that sense is meant by the foundations of the wall of Jerusalem, by the Urim and Thummim in the ephod of Aaron, by the Garden of Eden in which the King of Tyre had been; and also by the curtains and veils of the Tabernacle, and by the outer arrangements of the Temple in Jerusalem. However, it is meant in its real glory by the Lord when He was transfigured. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 42</h4><p>42. Our Word in its inmost depths is from its celestial sense like a gentle flame which burns, and in its middle recesses is from its spiritual sense like a light which illumines; consequently the Word in its ultimate form from its natural sense, within which are the two interior senses, is like a ruby and a diamond; from its celestial flame like a ruby, and from its spiritual light like a diamond. Since this is the nature of the Word in the sense of the Letter from its transparency, therefore, the Word in this sense is meant by the following: <p>(1) The foundations of the wall of Jerusalem. <p>(2) The Urim and Thummim on Aaron's ephod. <p>(3) The Garden of Eden, in which the king of Tyre had been. <p>(4) Also the curtains and veils of the Tabernacle. <p>(5) And the external things of the Temple at Jerusalem. <p>(6) But in its glory, the Lord when He was transfigured. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 42</h4><p>42. As, in its inmost bosom, from its celestial sense, our Word is like a flame that enkindles; and as, in its middle bosom, from its spiritual sense, it is like a light that enlightens; it follows that in its ultimate bosom, from its natural sense which has within it the two more interior senses, the Word is like a ruby and a diamond; like a ruby from its celestial flame, and like a diamond from its spiritual light. And as from its transparency the Word is like this in the sense of the letter, the Word in this sense of the letter is meant by the foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem; by the Urim and Thummim in Aaron's ephod; by the garden of Eden in which had been the king of Tyre; by the curtains and veils of the Tabernacle; and by the externals of the Temple at Jerusalem. But in its very glory the Word was represented by the Lord when He was transfigured. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 42 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>42. Quoniam Verbum nostrum in intimo suo sinu, ex sensu caelesti ejus, est sicut flamma quae accendit, et in medio suo sinu, ex sensu spirituali, est sicut lux quae illustrat, inde Verbum in ultimo suo sinu, ex sensu ejus naturali, in quo bini interiores sunt, est sicut rubinus et adamas; ex flamma caelesti sicut rubinus, et ex luce spirituali sicut adamas. Quia tale est Verbum in suo sensu litterae ex transparentia, ideo Verbum in hoc sensu intelligitur <p>(i) Per fundamenta muri Hierosolymae; <p>(ii.) Per Urim et Thummim in ephodo Aharonis; <p>(iii.) Per hortum Edenis in quo Rex Tyri fuerat; <p>(iv.) Tum etiam per aulaea et vela Tabernaculi; <p>(v.) Et per externa Templi Hierosolymitani: <p>(vi.) At in ipsa gloria, per Dominum cum transformatus est. </p>
