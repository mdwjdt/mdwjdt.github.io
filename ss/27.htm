<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">三、圣言的字义是它的属灵和属天意义的基础、容器和支撑</h4><p>SS27.神的一切工作里面都有一个首先，一个中间和一个末后；首先之物通过中间之物进入末后之物，从而显现并持续存在。因此，末后之物是一个基础。但首先也在中间里面，并通过中间而在末后里面；因此，末后之物是一个容器；末后之物因是一个容器和一个基础，故也是一个支撑。</p>

<p>27. The Literal Meaning of the Word Is the Foundation, the Container, and the Support of Its Spiritual and Heavenly Meanings
<p>IN every work of God there is something first, something intermediate, and something last; and what is first works through what is intermediate to what is last and in this way becomes manifest and persists, so what is last is a foundation. The first is also in the intermediate, and through the intermediate is in what is last, so what is last is a container; and since what is last is a container and a foundation, it is also a support. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 27</h4><p>27. The Word’s Literal Sense Is the Foundation, Containing Vessel and Buttress of Its Spiritual and Celestial Meanings<p>Every Divine work has in it a first, intermediate, and final element, and the first one progresses through the intermediate one to the final one, and so takes form and endures. Thus the final element is the foundation. Moreover, the first element is present in the intermediate one, and present through the intermediate one in the final one. Thus the final element is the containing vessel. And because the final element is the containing vessel and foundation, it is also the buttress. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 27</h4><p>27. III. The sense of the Letter of the Word is the basis, the containant and the support of the spiritual and celestial senses.<p>In every Divine work there is a first, a middle and a last; the first passes through the middle to the last, and so exists and subsists; consequently, the last is the basis. Again, the first is in the middle, and by means of the middle in the last, and thus the last is the containant; and because the last is the containant and the basis, it is also the support. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 27</h4><p>27. III. THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD IS THE BASIS, THE CONTAINANT, AND THE SUPPORT OF ITS SPIRITUAL AND CELESTIAL SENSES<p>In every Divine work there is a first, a middle, and a last (or ultimate); and the first passes through the middle to the last (or ultimate), and so comes into manifest being and subsists. Hence the last or ultimate is the basis. But the first is in the middle, and through the middle in the ultimate; so that the ultimate is the container. And as the ultimate is the container and the basis, it is also the support. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 27 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>27. (III.) QUOD SENSUS LITTERAE VERBI SIT BASIS, CONTINENS ET FIRMAMENTUM SENSUS SPIRITUALIS ET CAELESTIS EJUS. <p>In omni Divino opere est primum, medium et ultimum, ac primum vadit per medium ad ultimum, et sic existit et subsistit; inde ultimum est Basis. Tum, primum est in medio et per medium in ultimo; ita ultimum est continens. Et quia ultimum est continens et basis, est etiam Firmamentum. </p>
