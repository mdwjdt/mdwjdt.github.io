<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第25节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS25.圣言的灵义如今之所以被主揭开，是因为现在纯正真理的教义已经被启示了；只有这个教义与圣言的灵义是一致的。主带着荣耀和能力驾着天上的云显现（马太福音24:30，31）就表示这灵义；这一章论述了时代的完结，时代的完结是指教会的末期。圣言在灵义上的打开在启示录是应许了的。这就是启示录中白马和所有人被请赴的大筵席（启示录19:11-18）所表示的。启示录第19章还告诉我们，在很长一段时间内，灵义不会被人认识，至少不会被那些陷入虚假教义，尤其关于主的虚假教义，因而不承认真理的人认识。这就是启示录中要与骑在白马上的那位争战（19:19）的“兽”和“地上的君王”的意思。“兽”表示天主教徒（参看启示录17:3）；“地上的君王”表示陷入虚假教义的新教徒。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 25</h4>
<p>25. The reason the spiritual meaning of the Word has now been unveiled by the Lord is that a body of teaching based on genuine truth has now been revealed, and this teaching and no other is in harmony with the spiritual meaning of the Word.
<p>That spiritual meaning is indicated by the appearing of the Lord in the clouds of heaven with glory and power in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>, the chapter dealing with the close of the age, which is to be understood as the last time of the church.
<p>Then too, the opening of the Word with respect to its spiritual meaning was promised in the Book of Revelation. That is what is meant there by the white horse and the great supper to which all were invited (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-18</a>). Chapter <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_1.htm">19</a> also tells us that the spiritual meaning would not be recognized for a long time, at least by people mired in false teachings (especially about the Lord) and therefore closed to truth. That is the meaning of the beast and the monarchs of the earth in Revelation who were going to make war with the one who sat on the white horse (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_19.htm">19:19</a>). The beast means Papists (see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>), and the monarchs of the earth mean Protestants who are mired in false theological principles. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 25</h4><p>25. The Lord has disclosed the Word’s spiritual sense at the present day because a doctrine of genuine truth has now been revealed. And this doctrine, and no other, accords with the Word’s spiritual sense.<p>This sense is moreover symbolized by the Lord’s appearing on the clouds of heaven with glory and power (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30-31</a>), in a chapter dealing with the end of the age, meaning the ultimate end of the church.<p>An opening of the Word in respect to its spiritual sense was also promised in the book of Revelation. This sense is there meant by the white horse, and by the great supper to which all are summoned (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-18</a>).<p>The spiritual sense will for a long time not be acknowledged, and that solely because of people caught up in doctrinal falsities, especially falsities regarding the Lord, who therefore do not give entrance to truths. That is meant in the book of Revelation by the beast and the kings of the earth that were gathered to make war against Him who sat on the white horse (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a>). The beast means Roman Catholics, as in chapter <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_3.htm">17:3</a> there, and the kings of the earth mean those Protestant Reformed who are caught up in doctrinal falsities. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 25</h4><p>25. The spiritual sense of the Word has at this day been disclosed by the Lord because the doctrine of genuine truth has now been revealed; and this doctrine, and no other, agrees with the spiritual sense of the Word. This sense also is signified by the appearing of the Lord in the clouds of heaven with glory and power, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30-31</a>; and this chapter treats of the consummation of the age, by which is meant the last phase of the Church. The opening of the Word as to its spiritual sense was promised also in the Revelation. It is there meant by the white horse and by the great supper to which all are invited, in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-18</a>. <p>That for a long time the spiritual sense will not be acknowledged, and that this is owing entirely to those who are in falsities of doctrine, especially concerning the Lord, and who therefore do not admit truths, is meant in the Revelation by the beast and by the kings of the earth who were about to make war with Him that sat upon the white horse, chapter <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a>. By the beast are meant the Roman Catholics, as in chapter <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>; and by the kings of the earth are meant the Reformers, who are in falsities of doctrine. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 25</h4><p>25. The reason why the spiritual sense of the Word has been at this day disclosed by the Lord is that the doctrine of genuine truth has now been revealed; and this doctrine, and no other, is in accord with the spiritual sense of the Word. This sense, moreover, is signified by the appearing of the Lord in the clouds of heaven with glory and power (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30, 31</a>); which chapter treats of the consummation of the age, by which is meant the last time of the church. The opening of the Word as to its spiritual sense was also promised in Revelation. It is there meant by the "white horse," and by the "great supper" to which all are invited (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-18</a>). That for a long time the spiritual sense will not be recognized, and that this is entirely owing to those who are in falsities of doctrine, especially concerning the Lord, and who therefore do not admit truths, is meant in Revelation by the "beast," and by the "kings of the earth," who should make war with him that sat upon the white horse (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_19.htm">19:19</a>). By the "beast" are meant the Papists, as in chapter <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_3.htm">17:3</a>; and by the "kings of the earth" are meant the Reformed who are in false things of doctrine. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 25 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>25. Quod sensus spiritualis Verbi hodie a Domino detectus sit, est quia doctrina genuini veri nunc revelata est: et haec doctrina cum sensu spirituali Verbi concordat, et non alia. Ille sensus etiam significatur per apparitionem Domini "in nubibus caeli cum gloria et virtute," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_25/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_30-31">Matthaeus 24:30-31</a>; in quo capite agitur de consummatione saeculi, per quam intelligitur ultimum tempus ecclesiae. Aperitio Verbi quoad sensum ejus spiritualem etiam promissa est in Apocalypsi: ille ibi intelligitur per "equum album," et per "cenam magnam," ad quam omnes invitantur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_25/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_19_11-18">Apocalypsi 19:11-18</a>). Quod sensus spiritualis diu non agnoscetur, quod solum fit ab illis qui in falsis doctrinae sunt, imprimis de Domino, et ideo non admittunt Vera, intelligitur in Apocalypsi per "bestiam" et per "reges terrae," qui facturi bellum cum Sedente super Equo albo (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_25/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_19_19">Apocalypsi 19:19</a>); per "bestiam" intelliguntur Pontificii (ut <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_25/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_17_3">Apocalypsi 17:3</a> ibi), et per "reges terrae" intelliguntur Reformati, qui in falsis doctrinae sunt. </p>
