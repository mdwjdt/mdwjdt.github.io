<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS45.圣言字义的真理由以西结书中推罗王所在的伊甸园中的宝石来表示。我们在以西结书读到：</p>
<p>推罗王啊，你尺寸全封，满了智慧，全然美丽。你曾在伊甸神的园中。各样宝石作你的遮盖，就是红宝石、红璧玺、金刚石、水苍玉、红玛瑙、碧玉、蓝宝石、绿宝石、红玉和黄金。（以西结书28:12-13）</p>
<p>在圣言中，“推罗”表示真理和良善的知识；“王”表示教会的真理；“伊甸园”表示来自圣言的智慧和聪明；“宝石”表示因良善而透明的真理，就是圣言字义中的那种真理。宝石因表示这些真理，故被称为他的“遮盖”。字义遮盖圣言的内层，这一点可见于前一章（33；40节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 45</h4>
<p>45. Truths of the literal meaning of the Word are meant by the precious stones in the Garden of Eden where the king of Tyre was said to live, according to Ezekiel.
<p>We read in Ezekiel,
<p>O king of Tyre, you had sealed your full measure and were full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was your covering - ruby, topaz, and diamond; beryl, sardonyx, and jasper; sapphire, chrysoprase, and emerald; and gold. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-13</a>)
<p>Tyre in the Word means knowledge of what is true and what is good; a king means what is true in the church; the Garden of Eden means wisdom and understanding from the Word; precious stones mean truths from which light shines because they teach what is good - the kind we have in the literal meaning of the Word - and since this is what these stones mean, they are called its covering. On the literal meaning as the covering of the deeper levels of the Word, see under the preceding heading [<a href="../ss/33.htm">33</a>; see also <a href="../ss/40.htm">40</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 45</h4><p>45. Truths in the Word’s literal sense are meant by the precious stones in the Garden of Eden in which the King of Tyre is said in Ezekiel to have been. We read in Ezekiel:<p>...King of Tyre..., “You seal up (your) measure, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering: ruby, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, chrysoprase, and emerald, and gold. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-13</a>)<p>Tyre in the Word symbolizes concepts of truth and goodness. A king symbolizes the church’s truth. The Garden of Eden symbolizes wisdom and intelligence gained from the Word. Precious stones symbolize truths made translucent by goodness, the kind of truths found in the Word’s literal sense. And because these truths are symbolized by the precious stones, therefore they are called the king’s covering. That the literal sense covers over the inner constituents of the Word may be seen in the preceding section. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 45</h4><p>45. (3) THE TRUTHS OF THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD ARE MEANT BY THE PRECIOUS STONES IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN WHERE, ACCORDING TO EZEKIEL, THE KING OF TYRE IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN.<p>It is written in Ezekiel,<p>King of Tyre, thou sealest up thy sum, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden, the Garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the ruby, the topaz and the diamond; the beryl, the sardonyx and the jasper; the sapphire, the chrysoprasus and the emerald, and gold. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-13</a>. <p>By Tyre in the Word are signified the cognitions of truth and good; by the king is signified the truth of the Church; by the Garden of Eden are signified wisdom and intelligence from the Word; and by precious stones are signified truths translucent from good, such as are in the sense of the Letter of the Word. Because this is the signification of those stones therefore they are called his covering; and it may be seen in a preceding article that the sense of the Letter covers the interior things of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 45</h4><p>45. The truths of the sense of the letter of the Word are meant by the precious stones in the garden of Eden, in which, in Ezekiel, the king of Tyre is said to have been. We read in Ezekiel:<p>King of Tyre, thou sealest up thy sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the ruby, the topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the sardonyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the chrysoprase, and the emerald, and gold (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-13</a>).<p>"Tyre," in the Word, signifies the knowledges of truth and good; a "king," the truth of the church; the "garden of Eden," wisdom and intelligence from the Word; "precious stones," truths pellucid from good such as are in the sense of the letter of the Word. As the stones signify these truths, they are called his "covering." That the sense of the letter covers up the interiors of the Word, may be seen in a preceding chapter. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 45 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>45. (iii.) Quod vera sensus litterae Verbi intelligantur Per Lapides pretiosos in horto Edenis, in quo, apud Ezechielem, Rex Tyri dicitur fuisse.- Legitur apud Ezechielem, <p>Rex Tyri "tu obsignans demensum tuum, plenus sapientia, et perfectus pulchritudine. In Eden horto Dei fuisti; omnis lapis pretiosus tegumentum tuum, rubinus, topazius et adamas, tharschish, sardonyx, et jaspis, sapphirus, chrysoprasus et smaragdus, et aurum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_45/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_28_12-13">28:12-13</a>): <p>Per "Tyrum" in Verbo significantur cognitiones veri et boni; per "regem" significatur verum ecclesiae; per "hortum Edenis" significatur sapientia et intelligentia ex Verbo; per "lapides pretiosos" significantur "vera pellucentia ex bono, qualia sunt in sensu litterae Verbi; et quia haec per illos "lapides" significantur, ideo vocantur "tegumentum ejus." Quod sensus litterae tegat interiora Verbi, videatur articulus praecedens. </p>
