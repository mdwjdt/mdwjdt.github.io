<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第103节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS103.古人当中有一部圣言，这一点从提到它，并从中摘录了一些内容的摩西明显看出来（民数记21:14，15，27-30）；这部圣言的历史部分被称为“耶和华战记”，而它的预言部分则被称为“宣言”（Enunciations或Pronouncements）。摩西从这部圣言的历史部分引用了以下内容：</p>
<p>所以耶和华的战记上说，苏法的哇哈伯与亚嫩河，就是下到亚珥所住之地并靠近摩押边界的河道。（民数记21:14，15）</p>
<p>在这部圣言，和在我们的圣言一样，“耶和华的战争”表示并详细描述了当主降世时，祂与地狱的争战，以及对它的胜利。在我们圣言历史部分的许多经文中，像约书亚与迦南地各个民族的战争，以及以色列的士师和君王的战争，同样表示并描述了这些争战。</p>
<p>摩西从这部圣言的预言部分引用了以下内容：</p>
<p>所以那些发布宣言的说，你们来到希实本，愿西宏的城被建造、加固；因为有火从希实本发出，有火焰出于西宏的城。它吞灭了摩押的亚珥，就是那些占据亚嫩高地的人。摩押啊，你有祸了！基抹的民哪，你们灭亡了；他使自己的儿子成为逃亡者，使自己的女儿被掳，归与亚摩利人的王西宏。我们用箭毁灭了他们；希实本就毁灭，直到底本，我们已经荒废，直到挪法，这挪法直延到米底巴。（民数记21:27-30）</p>
<p>译者译作了“作诗歌的”，但应译作“发布宣言者”（Makers of Pronouncements），或“先知宣言”（Prophetic Pronouncements），这从希伯来语“moschalim”这个词的含义明显看出来，它不仅表示谚语或寓言，还表示先知的宣言，如在民数记（23:7，18，24:3，15），在这里经上说，巴兰发出他的宣言，这宣言实际上是一种预言，并且是关于主的。他的宣言被称为单数形式的“mashal”（译注：希伯来语，寓言的意思，常被翻译为谚语）。摩西从这个源头所引用的另外一些事不是谚语或寓言，而是预言。</p>
<p>这部古圣言和我们的一样，也是神性，或受神启的，这一点从耶利米书明显看出来，我们在那里会发现几乎一样的话：</p>
<p>有火从希实本发出，有火焰出于西宏中间，吞灭摩押的角和哄嚷人的头顶，摩押阿，你有祸了！基抹的民灭亡了，因你的众子都被夺去关押，你的众女也被关押。（耶利米书48:45-46）</p>
<p>除了这些书以外，大卫和约书亚都提到了古圣言的一本预言书，被称为雅煞耳书或义人之书。下面是大卫提到它的经文：</p>
<p>大卫作哀歌，吊扫罗和约拿单，并写下来，把这首弓歌教导犹大人。看哪，它写在雅煞珥书上。（撒母耳记下1:17，18）</p>
<p>下面是约书亚提到它的经文：</p>
<p>约书亚说，日头啊，你要停在基遍；月亮啊，你要止在亚雅仑谷。这事岂不是写在雅煞珥书上吗？（约书亚记10:12，13）</p>
<p>此外，我还被告知，创世记头七章的内容也出现在这部古圣言中，并且非常完整，以至于一字不漏。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 103</h4>
<p>103. We can tell from the books of Moses that there was a Word among the ancients because he mentioned it and excerpted from it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14-15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_27.htm">27-30</a>). We can tell that the narrative portions of that Word were called “The Wars of Jehovah, ” and that the prophetic portions were called “Pronouncements.” Moses quoted the following from the historical narratives of that Word:
<p>Therefore it says in The Book of the Wars of Jehovah, “Waheb in Suphah and the rivers Arnon, a watercourse of rivers that goes down to [where] Ar is inhabited and rests along the border of Moab.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14-15</a>)
<p>In that Word as in ours, the wars of Jehovah were understood to be, and served to describe in detail, the Lord’s battles against hell and his victories over it when he would come into the world. These same battles are meant and described time after time in the historical narratives of our Word - in Joshua’s battles against the nations of the land of Canaan, for example, and in the wars of the judges and the kings of Israel.</p>
<p>[2] Moses quoted the following from the prophetic portions of that Word:
<p>Therefore those who make pronouncements say, “Come to Heshbon! The city of Sihon will be built up and fortified, because fire has gone out from Heshbon, flame from the city of Sihon. It has devoured Ar of Moab, those who occupy the heights of Arnon. Woe to you, Moab! You have perished, people of Chemosh; he has made his sons fugitives and sent his daughters into captivity to Sihon, king of the Amorites. With arrows we have dealt with them; Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon, and we have spread destruction as far as Nophah, which extends to Medeba.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_27.htm">Numbers 21:27-30</a>)
<p>Translators change [the title of] this to “Composers of Proverbs, ” but it should be called “Makers of Pronouncements” or “Prophetic Pronouncements, ” as we can tell from the meaning of the word moschalim in Hebrew. It means not only proverbs but also prophetic utterances, as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_23_7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_23_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_3.htm">24:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_15.htm">15</a> where it says that Balaam gave forth his pronouncement, which was actually a prophetic utterance and was about the Lord. In these instances each of his pronouncements is called a mashal in the singular. There is also the fact that what Moses quoted from this source are not proverbs but prophecies.</p>
<p>[3] We can see that this Word was similarly divine or divinely inspired from a passage in Jeremiah where we find almost the same words:
<p>A fire has gone out from Heshbon and a flame from the midst of Sihon, which has devoured the corner of Moab and the top of the children of tumult. Woe to you, Moab! The people of Chemosh have perished, for your sons have been carried off into captivity and your daughters into captivity. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45-46</a>)
<p>Further, both David and Joshua mention another prophetic book of the former Word, The Book of Jasher or The Book of the Righteous One. Here is where David mentions it:
<p>David lamented over Saul and over Jonathan and wrote, “‘To Teach the Children of Judah the Bow.’ (You will find this written in The Book of Jasher.)” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_1_17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-18</a>)
<p>Here is where Joshua mentions it:
<p>Joshua said, “‘Come to rest, O sun, in Gibeon; and, O moon, in the valley of Aijalon.’ Is this not written in The Book of Jasher?” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_10_12.htm">Joshua 10:12-13</a>)
<p>Then too, I have been told that the first seven chapters of Genesis are right there in that ancient Word, so that not the slightest word is missing. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 103</h4><p>103. The existence of a Word among ancient peoples is clear also in the writings of Moses, who refers to it and quotes something from it in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14-15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_27.htm">27-30</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">21:14-15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_27.htm">27-30</a>. And the narrative portions of that Word were called The Wars of Jehovah, and the prophetic portions Oracles.<p>From the narrative portions of that Word Moses quoted the following:<p>Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of Jehovah: “Waheb in Suphah, and the streams, the Arnon, and the channel of the streams which went down to the dwelling place of Ar and stops at the border of Moab.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14-15</a>)<p>The wars of Jehovah in that book — as in ours — meant and described the Lord’s combats with hell and His victories over it, which would take place when He came into the world. These same combats are also meant and described in many places in the narrative portions of our Word—such as by the wars of Joshua with the nations of the land of Canaan, and by the wars of the judges and kings of Israel.</p><p>[2] From the prophetic portions of the Ancient Word Moses quoted the following:<p>Therefore the Oracles say: “Go into Heshbon; the city of Sihon will be built and established. For a fire has gone out from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it consumed Ar of Moab, the possessors of the heights of the Arnon. Woe to you, Moab! You have perished, O people of Chemosh! He has made his sons fugitives, and given his daughters into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites. We finished them with arrows; Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon. And we laid them waste as far as Nophah, which [reaches] even to Medeba.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_27.htm">Numbers 21:27-30</a>)<p>Translators render the source as “those who speak in proverbs, ” but they ought to be called Oracles or Prophetic Utterances, as can be seen from the meaning of the word moshalim in the original Hebrew, which means not only proverbs but also prophetic utterances—as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_23_7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_23_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_3.htm">24:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_15.htm">15</a>. In each of these verses Balaam is said to have uttered his oracle, which was a prophetic one (prophetic, in fact, of the Lord). His oracle each time is called mashal, in the singular. Moreover, the words quoted by Moses in these verses are not proverbs, but prophecies.</p><p>[3] That the Ancient Word was likewise Divine or Divinely inspired is apparent in Jeremiah, where almost the same words occur, namely:<p>...a fire has gone out from Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, which consumed the corner of Moab and the crown of the head of the sons of tumult. Woe to you, Moab! The people of Chemosh have perished! For your sons have been taken off into captivity, and your daughters into captivity. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45-46</a>)<p>In addition to these references, a prophetic book of the Ancient Word, called the Book of Jashar or Book of the Upright, is also cited by David and Joshua. By David:<p>David lamented...over Saul and over Jonathan..., and he wrote to teach the children of Judah [the Song of] the Bow; is it not written in the Book of Jasher? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_1_17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-18</a>)<p>And by Joshua:<p>...Joshua...said...: “Sun, stand still in Gibeon; and Moon, in the Valley of Aijalon." ...Is this not written in the Book of Jasher? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_10_12.htm">Joshua 10:12-13</a>)<p>Moreover, I have been told that the first seven chapters of Genesis are found in the same Ancient Word, so completely that not the least word is missing. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 103</h4><p>103. That a Word existed among the Ancients is evident from the writings of Moses in which he mentions it, and gives quotations from it <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14-15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_27.htm">27-30</a>. Its historical parts were called THE WARS OF JEHOVAH, and the prophetical parts ENUNCIATIONS. From the historical parts of that Word Moses quotes the following: <p>Wherefore it is said in the Book of The Wars of Jehovah, Vaheb in Supha, to the brooks of Arnon, And to the water-course of brooks which turned away where Ar is inhabited, and which halted at the border of Moab. (A.V. What he did in the Red Sea-margin, Vaheb in Suphah-and in the brooks of Arnon, And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.) <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14-15</a>.<p>By the wars of Jehovah mentioned in that Word, as in ours, are meant and described the Lord's combats with hell and His victories over it, when He should come into the world. The same combats are also understood and described in many passages in the historical parts of our Word, as in the wars of Joshua with the nations of the land of Canaan, and in the wars of the Judges and kings of Israel.<p> </p><p>[2] From the prophetical parts of that Word Moses has quoted the following:<p>Wherefore the Enunciators say (A.V. they that speak in proverbs), Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared: For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon. Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone. O people of Chemosh! he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon, king of the Amorites. We have slain them with darts (A.V. We have shot at them): Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_27.htm">Numbers 21:27-30</a>.<p>The translators render Enunciatores "composers of proverbs," but they should be called Enunciators, and their compositions "prophetical enunciations," as is evident from the signification of the word Moshalim in the Hebrew tongue, which means not only proverbs, but also prophetical enunciations; as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_23_7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_23_18.htm">18</a>; and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_3.htm">Numbers 24:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_15.htm">15</a>. It is there said that Balaam uttered "his enunciation," (A.V. parable), which was also prophetical, concerning the Lord. His enunciation is called Mashal in the singular; moreover, what Moses quotes are not proverbs, but prophecies. <p>That Word like ours, was Divinely inspired, as is evident from a passage in Jeremiah, where almost the same language is used:<p>A fire has gone (A.V. shall come) forth out of Heshbon ... and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and has devoured the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the sons of uproar. Woe be unto thee, 0 Moab! the people of Chemosh hath perished: for thy sons are taken away into captivity, and thy daughters into captivity. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45-46</a>. <p>In addition to these Books, mention is made by David and by Joshua of the prophetical Book of the Ancient Word, called the BOOK OF JASHER, or the BOOK OF THE UPRIGHT. David refers to it in the following passage: <p>David lamented ... over Saul and over Jonathan ... Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the Book of Jasher. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_1_17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-18</a>. <p>In Joshua it is mentioned in this passage: <p>Joshua said, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon: and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon! Is not this written in the Book of Jasher? <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_10_12.htm">Joshua 10:12-13</a>. <p>Moreover, I was informed that the first seven chapters of Genesis are extant in that Ancient Word, and that not the least word is wanting. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 103</h4><p>103. That there was a Word among the ancients is evident from Moses, who mentions it, and who took some things from it (Numbers 21: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">14, 15</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_27.htm">27-30</a>); the historical parts of that Word being called Wars of Jehovah, and its prophetical parts Enunciations. From the historical parts of that Word Moses took the following:<p>Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Jehovah, At Vaheb in Suphah, and the rivers of Arnon; and the watercourse of the rivers that inclineth toward the dwelling of Ar, and betaketh itself to the border of Moab (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_14.htm">Numbers 21:14, 15</a>).<p>In that Word, as in ours, the "Wars of Jehovah" meant and described the Lord's combats with hell and his victories over it at the time when He should come into the world. The same combats are meant, and are described, in many passages of the historical parts of our Word, such as the wars of Joshua with the nations of the land of Canaan, and those of the judges and kings of Israel.</p><p>[2] From the prophetical parts of that Word Moses took the following:<p>Wherefore the Enunciators say, Come ye to Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and strengthened; for a fire is gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon, it hath devoured Ar of Moab, the possessors of the high places of Arnon. Woe to thee, Moab! Thou hast perished, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites. With darts have we destroyed them. Heshbon hath perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_21_27.htm">Numbers 21:27-30</a>).<p>The translators say "They that speak in Proverbs," but the rendering should be "Enunciators," or "Prophetic Enunciations," as is evident from the meaning of the word m'shalim in the Hebrew tongue, which is not merely proverbs, but also prophetic enunciations, as in Numbers 23: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_23_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_23_18.htm">18</a>; 24: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/numbers_24_15.htm">15</a>, where it is said that Balaam uttered "his enunciation" which was prophetic, and which also was about the Lord. His enunciation is called mashal, in the singular. Consider also that the things taken from them by Moses are not proverbs, but prophecies.</p><p>[3] That the Ancient Word, like ours, was Divine or Divinely inspired, is evident from Jeremiah, where almost the same words occur:<p>A fire is gone forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, that hath devoured the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the sons of clamor. Woe unto thee, O Moab! The people of Chemosh is undone, for thy sons have been carried off into captivity, and thy daughters into captivity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_48_45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45-46</a>).<p>Besides these books, a prophetic book of the Ancient Word called the Book of Jashar, or the Book of the Upright, is mentioned by David and by Joshua. By David:<p>David lamented over Saul and over Jonathan, and wrote, To teach the sons of Judah the bow. Behold it is written in the Book of Jashar (2 Samuel 17-18).<p>And by Joshua:<p>Joshua said, Sun, be silent in Gibeon, and thou, moon, in the valley of Ajalon. Is not this written in the Book of Jashar? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/joshua_10_12.htm">Joshua 10:12-13</a>).<p>Furthermore: I have been told that the first seven chapters of Genesis appear in that Ancient Word complete to the slightest expression. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 103 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>103. Quod Verbum apud antiquos fuerit, constat etiam apud Mosen, a quo nominatur, et aliquod desumptum est (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_103/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_21_14-15">Numeri 21:14-15</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_103/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_21_27-30">27-30</a>); et quod historica illius Verbi appellata sint Bella Jehovae, ac prophetica Enuntiata.

Quod illud Verbum similiter Divinum seu Divinitus inspiratum fuerit, patet apud Jeremiam, ubi paene similia verba leguntur: <p>"Ignis exivit ex Chesbone, et flamma ab inter Sichonem, quae comedit angulum Moabi, et verticem filiorum strepitus.
