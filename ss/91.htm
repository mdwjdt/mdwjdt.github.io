<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第91节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">十、异端邪说有可能取自圣言的字义，但确认它们是真的，是会受到诅咒的</h4><p>SS91.前面（51-52节）说明，没有教义，就无法理解圣言，教义就像一盏明灯，能使我们看见纯正的真理。这是因为圣言完全是由对应构成的，这就是为何圣言里面有那么多真理的表象和非裸露的真理。其中许多适合属世人，甚至感官人理解，然而是以这种方式来理解的：简单人简单地理解，聪明人聪明地理解，智慧人智慧地理解。结果，在圣言中，真理的表象，也就是被包裹的真理，可能被当成了裸露真理；当被确认时，它们就变成了虚假。这就是那些自以为比谁都智慧的人所做的事，尽管他们并不智慧，因为智慧就是在确认某事之前，就看出它是不是真的，而不是随意去确认某种东西。这后一种事就是那些特别擅长证明，并且以自己的聪明为骄傲的人所做的；而前一种事是那些热爱真理，并被它们打动，只因它们是真理，并把它们应用于生活的人所做的。这些人被主光照，并在真理之光中看见真理。而其他人被自己光照，在虚假之光中看见虚假。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 91</h4>
<p>91. It Is Possible to Wrench Heretical Ideas from the Literal Meaning of the Word, but What Is Damning Is to Convince Ourselves [That They Are True]
<p>I have already shown [<a href="../ss/51.htm">51-52</a>] that the Word cannot be understood apart from a body of teaching and that a body of teaching serves as a kind of lamp that enables us to see genuine truths. This is because the Word is composed entirely of correspondences, which is why there are so many semblances of truth in it that are not bare truths, as well as many things written for the comprehension of earthly, sense-oriented people. Even so, they have been written so that ordinary people can understand them simply, intelligent people intelligently, and wise people wisely.
<p>Now, since that is what the Word is like, semblances of truth - clothed truths - can be seized on as bare truths, which become false if we convince ourselves of them. This is done by people who believe they are wiser than others, though in fact they are not wise at all. Wisdom is seeing whether something is true before convincing ourselves of it, not convincing ourselves of whatever happens to suit us. This latter is what people do when they are particularly good at proving things and have pride in their own intelligence. The former, though, is what people do who love truths and are moved by them because they are true and who put them to use in their lives. These people are enlightened by the Lord and see truths in the light of truths. The others are enlightened by themselves and see falsities in the light of what is false. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 91</h4><p>91. Heresies May Be Seized On from the Word’s Literal Sense, But It Is Harmful to Affirm Them<p>We showed above that the Word cannot be understood apart from doctrine, and that doctrine serves as a lamp in whose light genuine truths may be seen. And the reason is that the Word was written solely in terms of correspondences. As a result, the Word contains many appearances of truth that are not naked truths, and much was accommodated to the comprehension of natural people, even of sensual people, yet at the same time it was written in such a way that simple people can understand it in simplicity, and wise people wisely.<p>Now because that is the nature of the Word, the appearances of truth, which are truths clothed, may be seized on as naked truths. And when these are affirmed, they become falsities.<p>People who do this, however, are people who believe themselves wiser than others, even though they are not wise. For it is the part of wisdom to see whether something is true before affirming it, and not to affirm whatever one pleases. People who do the latter are people who possess a talent for defending their affirmations and are caught up in a conceit in their own intelligence. But those who do the former are people who love truths, who are affected by them because they are true, and who apply them to useful life endeavors. For they are enlightened by the Lord and see truths in the light of those truths, in contrast to the first people who create their own enlightenment and see falsities also in the light of those falsities. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 91</h4><p>91. X. Heresies may be formulated from the sense of the Letter of the Word, but it is harmful to confirm them.<p>It was shown above that the Word cannot be understood without doctrine, and that doctrine is like a lamp to make genuine truths visible. This is because the Word is written by pure correspondences; and consequently many things in it are appearances of truth, and not unveiled truths. Many of these are adapted to the comprehension of the natural, and indeed of the sensual man, yet in such a way that the simple can understand it in simplicity, the intelligent intelligently, and the wise in wisdom. Now since the Word is of this nature, appearances of truth, which are truths veiled, may be taken for unveiled truths; and when these are confirmed, they become falsities. This is done, however, by those who consider themselves to be wise above others, when yet they are not wise; for being wise consists in seeing whether a thing is true before it is confirmed, but not in confirming whatever one pleases. The latter is the practice with those who are by nature strongly inclined to confirming, and who take pride in their own intelligence; but the former obtains with those who love truths and are affected by them because they are truths, and who apply them to the uses of life; for they are enlightened by the Lord and see truths from the light of truth, whereas the others are enlightened by themselves and see falsities from the light of falsities. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 91</h4><p>91. X. IT IS POSSIBLE FOR HERESIES TO BE DRAWN FROM THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD, BUT IT IS HARMFUL TO CONFIRM THEM<p>It has been shown above that the Word cannot be understood without doctrine, and that doctrine is like a lamp that enables genuine truths to be seen, the reason of which is that the Word has been written entirely by correspondences, and consequently many things in it are appearances of truth and not naked truths; and many things also have been written in adaptation to the apprehension of the natural and even of the sensuous man, yet so that the simple may understand it in simplicity, the intelligent in intelligence, and the wise in wisdom. The result is that the appearances of truth in the Word, which are truths clothed, may be caught at as naked truths, and when they are confirmed they become falsities. But this is done by those who believe themselves wise above others, although they are not wise, for being wise consists in seeing whether a thing is true before it is confirmed, and not in confirming whatever one pleases. This last is done by those who excel in a genius for confirming and are in the conceit of self-intelligence, but the former is done by those who love truths and are affected by them because they are truths, and who make them uses of the life, for these persons are enlightened by the Lord, and see truths by the light of the truths; whereas the others are enlightened by themselves and see falsities by the light of the falsities. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 91 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>91. (X.) QUOD HAERESES EX SENSU LITTERAE VERBI CAPTARI POSSINT, SED QUOD CONFIRMARE ILLAS DAMNOSUM SIT. <p>Supra ostensum est, quod Verbum non possit intelligi absque doctrina, et quod doctrina sit sicut lucerna, ut genuina vera videantur; et hoc ex causa, quia Verbum per meras correspondentias conscriptum est, Inde est, quod plura ibi apparentiae veri sint, et non nuda vera; et plura ad captum naturalis, immo sensualis, hominis scripta, sed tamen ita ut simplices illud simpliciter possint intelligere, et intelligentes intelligenter, ac sapientes sapienter. Nunc quia Verbum tale est, possunt apparentiae veri, quae sunt vestita vera, pro nudis veris captari; quae dum confirmantur, fiunt falsa. Sed hoc fit ab illis qui supra alios se credunt sapere, cum tamen non sapiunt; nam sapere est videre num verum sit antequam confirmatur, non autem confirmare quodcunque lubet; hoc faciunt illi, qui genio confirmandi pollent, et in fastu propriae intelligentiae sunt; illud autem faciunt qui amant vera, et afficiuntur illis, quia vera sunt, et faciunt illa usus vitae; hi enim illustrantur a Domino, ac vident vera ex luce illorum; illi autem illustrantur a semet, et vident falsa etiam ex luce illorum. </p>
