<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS94.举例说明这一点。在圣言的许多地方，生气、发怒和报复被归于主；经上还说祂惩罚人，把人扔进地狱，试探人等等。人若简单地相信这一切，并因此惧怕神，小心翼翼不去得罪祂，就不会因这简单的信仰而被定罪。然而，人若确认这些观念到了这种地步，即：真的以为生气、发怒、报复，因而邪恶的事存在于主里面，主因生气、发怒、报复而惩罚人，把他扔进地狱，就会被定罪，因为他摧毁了纯正真理，即：主是爱本身，怜悯本身和良善本身，凡具有这些品质的人都不可能生气、发怒和报复。这些东西被归于主，是因为这是表象。其它情况也是这样。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 94</h4>
<p>94. Let me offer an example by way of illustration. There are many passages in the Word where the Lord is described as wrathful, raging, vengeful, and is said to punish, cast into hell, tempt, and the like. People who believe this in simplicity and therefore fear God and take care not to sin against him are not condemned because of their simplistic faith. However, if people convince themselves that these descriptions of the Lord are true even to the point of actually believing that wrath, rage, vengefulness, and the like, which are evil, are real characteristics of the Lord and that he does punish us and does cast us into hell out of wrath, rage, and vengefulness, they are condemned because they have destroyed the real truth, which is that the Lord is love itself, mercy itself, and goodness itself, and anyone who is these qualities is incapable of wrath, rage, and vengeance. Attributing the other qualities to the Lord is based on the way things seem. The same principle applies in many other cases. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 94</h4><p>94. But let us illustrate this with an example. Many places in the Word attribute anger, wrath and vengeance to the Lord, and say that He punishes, casts into hell, tempts, and many other like things. Someone who believes this in simplicity, and for that reason fears God and takes care not to sin against Him, is, because of the simplicity of that belief, not condemned. But someone who affirms these ideas in himself to the point that he believes that anger, wrath, and vengeance, and thus such attributes as are connected with evil, are found in the Lord, and that anger, wrath and vengeance are what cause the Lord to punish people and cast them into hell — such a one is condemned, because he has destroyed genuine truth, namely, that the Lord is love itself, mercy itself, and goodness itself, and someone who has these attributes cannot be angry, wrathful, or vengeful.<p>The attribution of these characteristics to the Lord is due to the appearance. And the like is the case in many other instances. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 94</h4><p>94. This may be illustrated by an example. In many passages in the Word anger, wrath and revenge are attributed to the Lord: and it is said that He punishes, casts into hell, tempts and does many other things of a similar nature. He who believes this in simplicity, and therefore fears God, and takes care not to sin against Him, is not condemned for this simple faith. He, however, is condemned whose confirmed belief is that anger, wrath, revenge, thus such things as originate in evil, exist in the Lord; and that He punishes men and casts them into hell from anger, wrath and revenge. Such a man is condemned because he has destroyed the genuine truth, which is, that the Lord is Love itself, Mercy itself and Goodness itself; and being these, that He cannot be angry, wrathful and revengeful. These things are attributed to the Lord according to the appearance; and so in many other cases. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 94</h4><p>94. Let us illustrate this by an example. In many places in the Word, anger, wrath, and vengeance are attributed to the Lord, and it is also said that He punishes, that He casts into hell, that He tempts, and many other such things. He who believes all this in simplicity, and on that account fears God and takes care not to sin against Him, is not condemned for that simple belief. But the man who confirms himself in these ideas to such a degree as to believe that anger, wrath, revenge, thus things that are of evil, exist in the Lord, and that from anger, wrath, and revenge He punishes a man and casts him into hell, is condemned, because he has destroyed the genuine truth that the Lord is love itself, mercy itself, and good itself, and that one who is these cannot be angry, wrathful, and revengeful. These things are attributed to the Lord because such is the appearance. So with many other things. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 94 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>94. Sed hoc illustretur per exemplum. In Verbo multis in locis tribuitur Domino ira, excandescentia, vindicta, et quod puniat, dejiciat in infernum, tentet, et plura similia. Qui hoc simpliciter credit, et propterea timet Deum, et sibi cavet a peccare contra Ipsum, ille propter simplicem illam fidem non damnatur; sed qui apud se confirmat illa eousque, ut credat quod ira, excandescentia, vindicta, et sic talia quae mali sunt, apud Dominum sint, et quod ex ira, excandescentia et vindicta hominem puniat, et in infernum dejiciat, ille damnatur, quia genuinum verum destruxit, quod est quod Dominus sit ipse Amor, ipsa Misericordia, et ipsum Bonum; et qui est illa, non potest irasci, excandescere, et vindicare. Quod illa Domino tribuantur, est ex apparentia. Similiter in multis aliis. </p>
