<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS41.由于字义上的圣言具有这种性质，所以可推知，那些寻求神性真理的人当以来自主的光照阅读圣言时，就会在属世之光中看见神性真理，只要他们的信仰是，圣言的核心是神性的神圣，尤其他们拥有基本的信仰，即：正是由于圣言的属灵和属天意义，圣言才是神性的神圣。因为显示圣言灵义的天堂之光流入显示圣言字义的属世之光，并光照被称为理性的人的认知能力，使他看见并认识神性真理，既看见神性真理在哪里显现，又看见它们在哪里隐藏。对有些人来说，这些神性真理连同天堂之光一起流入；有时甚至在他们不知不觉的情况下流入。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 41</h4>
<p>41. Since that is what the Word is like in its literal meaning, it follows that readers who are seeking divine truths see divine truths in an earthly light when they are reading the Word in enlightenment from the Lord, provided their faith is that at heart the Word is divinely holy; and especially if they have a basic trust that this quality of the Word is the result of its spiritual and heavenly meaning. This is because heaven’s light, the light that shows us the spiritual meaning of the Word, flows into the earthly light that shows us the literal meaning of the Word and enlightens that mental function that we call our reasoning powers, causing them to see and recognize where divine truths stand out and where they lie hidden. These insights flow in with heaven’s light for some people, sometimes even when they are not aware of it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 41</h4><p>41. Since that is the nature of the Word in its literal sense, it follows that when people read the Word in a state of enlightenment from the Lord — people who possess Divine truths and a belief that the Word at its core has a holy Divinity within it, and still more, people who believe that that is the nature of the Word because of its spiritual and celestial senses — they see Divine truths with their natural sight. For the light of heaven, the light in which the Word’s spiritual sense exists, flows into the person’s natural sight, in which the Word’s literal sense exists, and enlightens the person’s intellectual faculty called reason, enabling him to see and acknowledge Divine truths, both where they are evident and where they lie concealed.<p>In some cases these truths flow in with the light of heaven even at times when the people are unaware of it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 41</h4><p>41. Since this is the nature of the Word in the sense of the Letter, it follows that those who are principled in Divine truths, and who believe that the Word is interiorly holy and Divine, and especially those who believe that the Word is of this nature by virtue of its spiritual and celestial senses, see Divine truths in natural light, while they read the Word in a state of enlightenment from the Lord. For the light of heaven, in which is the spiritual sense of the Word, flows into the natural light in which is the sense of the Letter of the Word, and enlightens man's intellectual faculty, called the rational, enabling him to see and acknowledge Divine truths, both when they are manifest and when they are concealed. These truths, together with the light of heaven, flow into the minds of some men, even when they are unaware of the fact. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 41</h4><p>41. Such being the Word in the sense of the letter, it follows that they who are in Divine truths, and in the faith that the Word within, in its bosom, is Divine holiness - and much more they who are in the faith that it is from its spiritual and celestial senses that the Word is Divine holiness - see Divine truths in natural light while reading the Word in enlightenment from the Lord. For the light of heaven (in which is the spiritual sense of the Word) flows into the natural light in which is its sense of the letter, and illumines man's intellectual called the rational, and causes him to see and recognize Divine truths, both where they stand in plain view, and where they lie concealed. With some these Divine truths flow in along with the light of heaven; sometimes even when they are not aware of it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 41 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>41. Quoniam Verbum in sensu litterae tale est, sequitur, quod illi qui in Divinis veris sunt et in fide quod Verbum intus in suo sinu sanctum Divinum sit, et magis illi qui in fide sunt quod Verbum tale sit ex sensu spirituali et caelesti ejus, dum in illustratione a Domino legunt Verbum, videant Divina vera in luce naturali; nam lux caeli, in qua est sensus spiritualis Verbi, influit in lucem naturalem, in qua est sensus litterae Verbi, ac hominis intellectuale, quod vocatur rationale, illuminat, et facit ut videat et agnoscat Divina vera, ubi exstant et ubi latent: haec cum luce caeli influunt apud quosdam, quandoque etiam cum nesciunt. </p>
