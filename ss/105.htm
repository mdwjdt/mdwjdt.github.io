<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第105节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS105.只是我需要解释一下主与天堂的同在和结合是如何通过圣言存在于全地的。在主眼里，整个天堂就像一个人，教会也是如此。它们也的确看似一个人，对此，可参看《天堂与地狱》一书（59-86节）。在这个人里面，圣言被阅读，并且主由此被知晓所在的教会，如同心和肺；属天国度如同心，属灵国度如同肺。</p>
<p>正如一切肢体和器官都靠人体的两大生命源泉来维持并存活，全地所有拥有某种宗教信仰，敬拜一位神，并过着良善生活的人都靠主和天堂藉由圣言与教会的结合来维持并存活。他们凭自己的信仰和生活而在这个人里面，并对应于它在含有心肺的胸腔之外的肢体和器官。因为圣言虽在教会存在于相对较少的人当中，但仍从主经由天堂将生命赋予其余的世人，正如心肺将生命赋予全身的肢体和器官。事实上，这种联系或共享是相似的。</p>
<p>这就是为何阅读圣言的基督徒形成这个人的胸部。他们在中心，他们周围是天主教徒，天主教徒周围是承认主为最大先知和神儿子的伊斯兰教徒或穆斯林，接下来是非洲人；而亚洲和印度的各民族和人民构成最外围。关于这种安排，进一步的信息可见于《最后的审判》一书（48节）。此外，在这个人里面的所有人都面向基督徒所在的中心区域。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 105</h4>
<p>105. I need to explain, though, how the presence and union of the Lord and heaven happens in all lands by means of the Word.
<p>In the Lord’s sight, the whole heaven is like one human being, and so is the church (see <a href="../hh/59.htm">Heaven and Hell 59-86</a> on the fact that they actually look like a human being to him). In that human being, the church (that is, the church where the Word is read and the Lord is therefore known) functions as the heart and as the lungs - the [church’s] heavenly kingdom as the heart and the [church’s] spiritual kingdom as the lungs.</p>
<p>[2] Just as all the other members and organs are maintained and live from these two founts of life in the human body, so too all the people in the various countries of the world who have any religion, worship one God, and live good lives are maintained and live from the union of the Lord and heaven with the church through the Word. By virtue of their faith and life, they are in that human being and reflect its members and organs that are outside the chest cavity where the heart and lungs are. This is because even though the Word in the church may be among relatively few, it gives life from the Lord through heaven to the rest [of the world], just as the heart and lungs give life to the members and organs of the whole body. In fact the sharing is similar.</p>
<p>[3] This is why Christians who read the Word form the chest of that human being. They are at the center, with the Catholics around them; the Muslims who recognize the Lord as the greatest prophet and as a Son of God are around them. Next come the Africans. And the outermost circle is made up of nations and peoples in Asia and in India. There is some further information about this arrangement in <a href="../lj/48.htm">48</a> of Last Judgment.
<p>All the people in that human being face toward the central area where the Christians are. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 105</h4><p>105. We need to explain, however, how the presence of the Lord and heaven and conjunction with them is possible in all lands by means of the Word.<p>The whole of heaven is, in the Lord’s sight, like a single person. So, too, the church. To be shown that it also actually appears as a person, see the book <a href="../hh/59.htm">Heaven and Hell 59-86</a>.<p>In that person, the church where the Word is read, and where the Lord is consequently known, is like the heart and lungs — the celestial kingdom being as though the heart, and the spiritual kingdom the lungs.</p><p>[2] As the heart and lungs are the two founts of life in the human body, and all the rest of the organs and viscera subsist and have life from them, so also do all people in the world subsist and have life from the conjunction of the Lord and heaven with the church through the Word — all those who have any religion, who worship one God and live rightly, who are therefore included in that grand humanity, and who relate to its organs and viscera surrounding the thoracic cavity which contains the heart and lungs. For the Word in the church, even if possessed by relatively few, is life to all the rest from the Lord through heaven, as the organs and viscera of the entire body have life from the heart and lungs. They also have a similar communication.</p><p>[3] This, too, is the reason that Christians among whom the Word is read constitute the breast of that grand humanity. They are also at the center of all, with Roman Catholics round about them. Around them are Muslims who acknowledge the Lord as a very great prophet and as the Son of God. After them come Africans. And the outmost periphery is composed of nations and peoples from Asia and the Indies. Regarding the arrangement of these peoples, something more may be seen in the short work <a href="../lj/48.htm">The Last Judgment 48</a>.<p>All those who are in that grand humanity also face toward the middle where the Christians are. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 105</h4><p>105. It will now be shown how the Lord and heaven are present, and how conjunction with them is effected throughout the whole earth by means of the Word. The whole heaven is, in the sight of the Lord, as one man. So also is the Church; and that they actually assume the appearance of a man may be seen in the work <a href="../hh/59.htm">HEAVEN AND HELL 59-86</a>. In this Man the Church, where the Word is read and by means of which the Lord is known, is like the heart and lungs; the celestial kingdom is like the heart, and the spiritual kingdom like the lungs.<p> </p><p>[2] As from these two fountains of life in the human body all the other members and viscera subsist and live, so also do all those throughout the world who have a religion, worship one God and live good lives, thereby forming part of this Man. They represent the members and viscera outside the chest in which are the heart and lungs, and they subsist and live from the union of the Lord and heaven with the Church by means of the Word. For the Word in the Church, although it is with comparatively few, is life to the rest [of the world] from the Lord through heaven just as the members and viscera of the whole body receive life from the heart and lungs. The manner of communication between them is also similar; and for this reason Christians among whom the Word is read constitute the breast of this Man. They are in the centre of all, and round about them are the Roman Catholics; around these again are the Mohammedans, who acknowledge the Lord to be the supreme Prophet and the Son of God. After these come the Africans, while the nations and peoples of Asia and the Indies form the outermost circumference. Some particulars of this arrangement of people may be seen in the little work <a href="../lj/48.htm">THE LAST JUDGMENT 48</a>. All who are in this Man also look toward the centre where the Christians are. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 105</h4><p>105. But in what way the presence and conjunction of the Lord and heaven exist in all lands by means of the Word shall now be told. Before the Lord the universal heaven is like one man, and so is the church. And that they actually appear as a man may be seen in Heaven and Hell (n. <a href="../hh/59.htm">59-86</a>). In this man, the church where the Word is read and the Lord thereby known, is as the heart and lungs; the celestial kingdom as the heart, and the spiritual kingdom as the lungs.</p><p>[2] As all the other members and viscera subsist and live from these two fountains of life of the human body, so also do all those in the whole earth who have some sort of religion, worship one God, and live aright, and who are thereby in that man and correspond to its members and viscera outside the chest which contains the heart and lungs - subsist and live from the conjunction of the Lord and heaven with the church by means of the Word. For the Word in the church, although existing with comparatively few, is life to all the rest, from the Lord through heaven, just as there is life for the members and viscera of the whole body from the heart and lungs, and there is a similar communication.</p><p>[3] This is why those Christians among whom the Word is read constitute the breast of that man. They are the midmost of all; round about them are the Papists; around these again are those Mohammedans who acknowledge the Lord as the greatest Prophet and as the Son of God; beyond these are the Africans; while the nations and people of Asia and the Indies constitute the furthest compass. Concerning this ranking of them something may be seen in Last Judgment (n. <a href="../ss/48.htm">48</a>). Moreover all who are in that man look toward the middle region where the Christians are. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 105 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>105. Quomodo autem praesentia et conjunctio Domini et caeli datur in omnibus terris per Verbum, dicetur. Universum caelum coram Domino est sicut unus homo, similiter ecclesia; quod etiam actualiter appareant ut homo, videatur in Opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_105/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_59">De Caelo et Inferno 59-86</a>. <sup>1</sup>In illo homine est ecclesia, ubi Verbum legitur, et per id Dominus notus est, sicut cor et sicut pulmo; regnum caeleste ut cor, et regnum spirituale ut pulmo. Sicut ex his binis fontibus vitae in humano corpore omnia reliqua membra et viscera subsistunt et vivunt, ita quoque omnes illi in terrarum orbe, apud quos religiosum est, et Deus unus colitur, et bene vivitur, et per id in homine illo sunt, et referunt membra et viscera ejus extra thoracem, ubi sunt cor et pulmo, ex conjunctione Domini et caeli per Verbum cum ecclesia, subsistunt et vivunt. Nam Verbum in ecclesia, tametsi est apud paucos respective, est vita reliquis a Domino per caelum, sicut membrorum et viscerum totius corporis est vita ex corde et pulmone; est quoque communicatio similis. Quae etiam causa est, quod Christiani apud quos Verbum legitur, constituant pectus illius hominis: sunt etiam in medio omnium, et circum illos sunt Pontificii, circum hos sunt Mahumedani qui agnoscunt Dominum ut Maximum Prophetam ac ut Filium Dei; post hos autem sunt Africani; ac ultimam circumferentiam constituunt gentes et populi in Asia et in Indiis: de qua illorum ordinatione videantur aliqua in opusculo <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_105/swedenborg_de-ultimo-judicio_48">De Ultimo Judicio 48</a>). Spectant etiam omnes, qui in homine illo sunt, versus meditullium, ubi sunt Christiani.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;86 pro "87" </p>
