<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第99节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS99.教会的状态因着主甚至成为最外层上的圣言而被彻底改变。主降世前的所有教会都是代表性教会，只能在阴暗中看见神性真理。然而，主降世之后，祂建立了一个在光中看见神性真理的教会。两者的区别就像傍晚和早晨之间的区别，主降临前的教会状态被称为“傍晚”，主降临后的教会状态被称为“早晨”。主在降世之前的确与教会之人同在，但却是经由天堂间接同在的；而自祂降世时起，祂就直接与他们同在了，因为祂在世上披上了神性属世层，祂在这神性属世层中与世人同在。主的荣耀就是祂在世上所取的人身的荣耀，得了荣耀的主之人身就是神性属世层。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 99</h4>
<p>99. The state of the church was completely changed by the Lord’s becoming the Word even on the outermost level. All the churches before his Coming had been outward forms of a church, churches that could see divine truth only in the dark. However, after the Lord’s Coming into the world, a church was started by him that saw divine truth in the light. The difference is like the difference between evening and morning. In fact, the state of the church before his Coming is called evening, and the state of the church after his Coming is called morning.
<p>Before his Coming into the world, the Lord was of course present with the people of the church, but indirectly, through heaven; whereas since his Coming into the world he is directly present with the people of the church. This is because he put on a divine earthly form in the world, the form in which he is present with us. The Lord’s “glorification” is the complete glorification of the human nature that he took on in the world, and the glorified human form of the Lord is the divine-earthly form. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 99</h4><p>99. As a result of the Lord’s becoming also the Word in outmost expressions, the state of the church was entirely changed. The churches prior to the Lord’s advent were all representational churches, and they could see only a shadow of Divine truth. But after the Lord’s advent into the world, a church was established by Him that saw Divine truth in a state of light. The difference is as the difference between evening and morning. The state of the church before His advent is also called evening [in the Word], while the state of the church after His advent is called morning.<p>Before His advent into the world the Lord was indeed present with people of the church, but indirectly through heaven. But ever since His advent into the world He is present with people of the church directly. For in the world He put on also a natural Divinity in which He is present with people.<p>The Lord’s glorification is a glorification of His humanity, the humanity He assumed in the world. And the Lord’s glorified humanity is His natural Divinity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 99</h4><p>99. By reason of the fact that the Lord also became the Word in ultimates, the state of the Church was entirely changed. All the Churches before His Coming were representative Churches, and these were not able to see Divine Truth, except in the shade. But after the Lord's Coming into the world, a Church was instituted by Him which saw Divine Truth in the light. The difference is as between evening and morning. The state of the Church before His Coming is also called evening, and the state of the Church after His Coming is called morning. Before His Coming into the world the Lord was indeed present with men of the Church, but mediately through heaven; whereas after His Coming into the world He is present with men of the Church immediately. For in the world He put on the Divine Natural also, in which He is present with men. The glorification of the Lord is the glorification of His Human, which He assumed in the world; and the glorified Human of the Lord is the Divine Natural. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 99</h4><p>99. The state of the church was completely changed by the Lord's becoming the Word in ultimates. All the churches that had existed before His advent were representative churches and could see Divine truth in the shade only; but after the Lord's coming into the world a church was instituted by Him that saw Divine truth in the light. The difference is like that between evening and morning, and the state of the church before his advent is also called "the evening," and that of the church after it "the morning." Before his coming into the world the Lord was indeed present with the men of the church, but mediately through heaven, whereas since His coming into the world He is present with them immediately, for in the world He put on the Divine Natural, in which He is present with men. The glorification of the Lord is the glorification of His Human that He assumed in the world, and the Lord's glorified Human is the Divine Natural. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 99 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>99. Per id, quod Dominus etiam factus sit Verbum in ultimis, status ecclesiae prorsus mutatus est. Omnes ecclesiae, quae ante adventum Ipsius fuerunt, ecclesiae representativae fuerunt; quae Divinum Verum non videre potuerunt nisi quam in umbra: at post adventum Domini in mundum, ecclesia ab Ipso instituta est, quae Divinum Verum vidit in luce. Differentia est, qualis inter Vesperam et mane; status ecclesiae ante adventum Ipsius etiam vocatur "vespera," et status ecclesiae post adventum Ipsius Vocatur "mane." Dominus ante adventum suum in mundum quidem praesens fuit apud homines ecclesiae, sed mediate per caelum; at post adventum suum in mundum praesens est apud homines ecclesiae immediate; nam in mundo induit etiam Divinum Naturale, in quo apud homines praesens est. Glorificatio Domini est glorificatio Humani Ipsius, quod assumpsit in mundo; ac Humanum Domini glorificatum est Divinum Naturale. </p>
