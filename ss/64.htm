<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS64.大量经历清楚向我显明，属灵天使在圣言的属灵意义里面，属天天使在圣言的属天意义里面。当我以圣言的字义来阅读圣言时，得以发觉与天堂的一种交流被打开了，有时是与天堂的这个社群，有时是与那个社群；我照属世意义所理解的东西，属灵天使照属灵意义来理解，属天天使则照属天意义来理解，并且这一切是瞬间发生的。我因成千上万次地感知过这种交流，所以再也无法对它有任何怀疑。此外，天堂之下的一些灵人滥用这种交流；他们复述字义中的一些话，立即观察并记下与之实现交流的那个社群。我经常看见并听说这种事。这种亲身经验使我得知，字义上的圣言是与主并天堂结合的神性媒介。关于通过圣言所实现的这种结合，也可参看《天堂与地狱》一书（303-310节）的相关说明。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 64</h4>
<p>64. Abundant experience has made it clear to me that spiritual angels are focused on the spiritual meaning of the Word and that heavenly angels are focused on its heavenly meaning. I have been made aware that when I was reading the Word in its literal meaning a communication was opened with one community or another of the heavens, and that spiritual angels were understanding in a spiritual way, and heavenly angels in a heavenly way, what I was understanding in an earthly way, and that this was happening instantaneously. I have been aware of this so many thousand times that I can no longer have any doubt about it.</p>
<p>[2] There are also spirits who live underneath the heavens who misuse this communication. What they do is repeat some things that are said in the literal meaning of the Word and promptly identify and mark the community with which communication has been effected. This too I have often seen and heard.
<p>This kind of firsthand experience has taught me that the Word in its literal meaning is a divinely granted means of union with the Lord and with heaven. On this union by means of the Word, see also what is presented in <a href="../hh/303.htm">Heaven and Hell 303-310</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 64</h4><p>64. That spiritual angels have the Word’s spiritual sense, and celestial angels its celestial sense, has been made clear to me as the result of much experience.<p>I have been granted to perceive that whenever I have read the Word in its literal sense, a communication with the heavens has occurred, now with one society of them, now with another; and that what I have understood in accordance with the natural sense, spiritual angels have understood in accordance with its spiritual sense, and celestial angels in accordance with its celestial sense. And this in an instant.<p>Because I have perceived this communication several thousand times, I have been left with no doubt about it.</p><p>[2] There are also some spirits below the heavens who abuse this communication. For they recite some passages from the Word’s literal sense and immediately observe and note the society with which the communication takes place. I have often witnessed and heard this also.<p>From these occurrences I have been given to know by personal experience that the Word in its literal sense makes possible a conjunction with the Lord and heaven.<p>Regarding this conjunction by means of the Word, see also what we presented in the book <a href="../hh/303.htm">Heaven and Hell 303-310</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 64</h4><p>64. It has been proved to me by much experience that the spiritual angels are in the spiritual sense of the Word, and the celestial angels in its celestial sense. It has been granted me to perceive that, while I was reading the Word in the sense of the Letter, communication was opened with the heavens, sometimes with one society of them, sometimes with another. What I understood according to the natural sense, spiritual angels understood according to the spiritual sense, and celestial angels according to the celestial sense, and this instantly. As I have perceived this communication many thousands of times, I have not any doubt left concerning it. Moreover, some spirits dwelling under the heavens abuse this communication. They repeat some passages from the sense of the Letter of the Word, forthwith observing and making a note of the society with which communication is effected. I have frequently seen and heard this being done. Thus by actual experience it has been granted me to know that the Word, as to the sense of its Letter, is the Divine medium of conjunction with the Lord and with heaven. Concerning this conjunction by means of the Word see also what is adduced in the work <a href="../hh/303.htm">HEAVEN AND HELL 303-310</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 64</h4><p>64. It has been made plain to me by much experience that the spiritual angels are in the spiritual sense of the Word, and the celestial angels in its celestial sense. While reading the Word in its sense of the letter it has been given me to perceive that communication was effected with the heavens, now with this society of them, now with that, and that what I understood according to the natural sense, the spiritual angels understood according to the spiritual sense, and the celestial angels according to the celestial sense, and this in an instant. As I have perceived this communication many thousands of times, there remains with me no doubt about it. Moreover there are spirits beneath the heavens who abuse this communication; they recite some sayings from the sense of the letter, and immediately observe and take note of the society with which communication is effected. This I have frequently seen and heard. From these things it has been given me to know by actual experience that the Word in respect to its sense of the letter is the Divine medium of conjunction with the Lord and with heaven. (Concerning this conjunction by the Word see also what is said in Heaven and Hell, n. <a href="../hh/303.htm">303-310</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 64 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>64. Quod angeli spirituales in sensu spirituali Verbi sint, et angeli caelestes in sensu caelesti ejus, manifestatum est mihi per multam experientiam. Datum est percipere, quod cum legi Verbum in sensu litterae ejus, communicatio facta sit cum caelis, nunc cum hac illorum societate, nunc cum illa; et quod ea, quae ego secundum sensum naturalem intellexi, angeli spirituales secundum sensum spiritualem, et angeli caelestes secundum sensum caelestem intellexerint, et hoc in instanti. Haec communicatio quia per aliquot millenas vices percepta est, de illa non relicta est mihi ulla dubitatio. Sunt etiam spiritus qui infra caelos sunt, et hac communicatione abutuntur; recitant enim aliquot dicta ex sensu litterae Verbi, et illico animadvertunt et notant societatem cum qua communicatio fit: hoc etiam saepe vidi et audivi. Ex his per vivam experientiam datum est scire, quod Verbum quoad sensum litterae ejus sit Divinum medium conjunctionis cum Domino et cum caelo. De hac conjunctione per Verbum videantur etiam quae in opere (De Caelo et Inferno 393-310) allata sunt. </p>
