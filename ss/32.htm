<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS32.然而，这些事无法以三言两语解释清楚。它们确是天堂天使所熟悉的奥秘，这些奥秘将尽可能地在《教义之主篇》的序言所列举的著作中展开，即：《圣治》（全称《关于神性治理的天使智慧》）；《神性全能，全在和全知，无限和永恒》（全称《关于神性全能，全在和全知，无限和永恒的天使智慧》）；《圣爱与圣智》（全称《关于神性之爱与神性智慧的天使智慧》）；《生活》（全称《关于生活的天使智慧》）。圣言本质上是拯救人类的一部神性著作。就目前而言，我们从前面所述足以得出这个结论：被称为“字义”的圣言最低或属世意义是它的两层内在意义的基础、容器和支撑。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 32</h4>
<p>32. However, there is no way to explain briefly how this happens. These are mysteries familiar to heaven’s angels that will be unfolded - as far as possible - in the treatises listed in the preface to Teachings on the Lord: Angelic Wisdom about Divine Providence; Angelic Wisdom about Omnipotence, Omnipresence, and Omniscience; Angelic Wisdom about Divine Love and Wisdom; and Angelic Wisdom about Life.
<p>The Word is essentially a divine work for the salvation of the human race. For present purposes, it will suffice to conclude from what has been said above that the Word’s last level of meaning (which is earthly and is called “the literal meaning”) is a foundation, container, and support for its two deeper levels of meaning. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 32</h4><p>32. But it is impossible to say in a few words how these levels take form. They are also secrets possessed by angels in heaven, which we will lay open as far as possible in the treatises mentioned in the Preface to The Doctrine Regarding the Lord, which will be those of angelic wisdom regarding Divine Providence, regarding Divine Omnipotence, Omnipresence, and Omniscience, regarding Divine Love and Wisdom, and regarding Life.<p>It is enough for now to make it possible for people to conclude from what we have said above that the Word — which is the Divine work for the salvation of the human race — in respect to its lowest sense, which is natural and called its literal sense, is the foundation, containing vessel, and buttress of the two interior senses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 32</h4><p>32. But how these things are brought about cannot be stated in a few words. They are, moreover, arcana which engage the angels of heaven, and they will be explained as far as possible in the treatises mentioned in the Preface to THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD. These will be explained from angelic wisdom, concerning Divine Providence, Omnipotence, Omnipresence, Omniscience, Divine Love, and Divine Wisdom, and also Life. It is sufficient for the present that we may conclude from what has been said above that the Word, which is an essentially Divine Work designed for the salvation of the human race, as to its lowest or natural sense, called the sense of the Letter, is the basis, the containant and the support of the two interior senses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 32</h4><p>32. But how these things come to pass cannot be told in a few words. Indeed they are arcana in which are the angels of heaven, and which will be unfolded, so far as can possibly be done, in the treatises mentioned in the preface to Doctrine of the Lord - and which will be from angelic wisdom - on the Divine Providence, Omnipotence, Omnipresence, Omniscience, on Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, and On Life. <sup>1</sup>For the present it is sufficient to conclude from what has been said above, that the Word - which is in an especial sense a Divine work for the salvation of mankind - in respect to its ultimate sense, which is natural and is called the sense of the letter, is the Basis, the Container, and the Support of the two interior senses.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;Although the treatise here named was never published as a separate work, the subjects of it are specially treated of in the first chapter of the True Christian Religion. See also the references to the same subjects in the Doctrine of the Lord (n. 65e), in the Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom (n. 9). [Translator.]  </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 32 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>32. Sed quomodo haec fiunt, non paucis dici potest. Sunt etiam arcana, in quibus sunt angeli caeli, quae in transactionibus in praefatione ad Doctrinam de Domino memoratis, quae erunt ex Sapientia Angelica, de Divina Providentia, Omnipotentia, Omnipraesentia, Omniscientia, de Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia, tum de Vita, quantum fieri potest, evolventur. Satis nunc est, quod ex supradictis possit concludi, quod Verbum, quod est ipsum Divinum Opus pro Salvatione Humani Generis, quoad sensum ejus ultimum, qui est naturalis, et vocatur sensus litterae, sit <sup>1</sup>binorum sensuum interiorum basis, continens et firmamentum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;sit pro "sint" </p>
