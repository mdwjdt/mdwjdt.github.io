<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第109节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS109.在这方面可用尘世太阳的热和光来作一个类比。只要太阳升起并出现在这个世界上，热和光就会使树木和灌木生长，即便它们在直射光线之外，即在阴影中，或在云彩下面。来自显为太阳的主的天堂之光和热同样如此，这光是神性真理，而神性真理是天使和世人一切聪明智慧的源头。这就是为何经上论到圣言说：</p>
<p>圣言与神同在，就是神；它照亮一切来到世上的人。（约翰福音1:1，9）</p>
<p>又说：</p>
<p>这光照在黑暗里。（约翰福音1:5）</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 109</h4>
<p>109. We can draw a comparison with the warmth and light of earth’s sun, which nurtures the growth of trees and shrubs even if they stand in the shadows or under a cloud, as long as the sun rises and appears in the world. Likewise, heaven’s light and warmth is from the Lord as its sun. That light is the divine truth that is the source of all our intelligence and wisdom, whether we are angels or people [still in this world]. That is why it says of the Word that it “was with God and was God” and that it “enlightens everyone who comes into the world” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>), and that “that light” even “shines in the darkness” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_5.htm">John 1:5</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 109</h4><p>109. A comparison may be drawn with the warmth and light of the world’s sun, which enable trees and bushes to grow, even those which are off to the side or under a cloud, provided the sun has risen and become visible in the world.<p>Such is the case with the light and warmth in heaven, radiating from the Lord as the sun, and the light is Divine truth, from which angels and people have all their intelligence and wisdom. So it is said regarding the Word that it was with God, and was God, that it enlightens every man coming into the world (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>), and that the same light appears even in darkness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_5.htm">John 1:5</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 109</h4><p>109. This may be illustrated by comparison with the heat and light from the sun of this world which cause vegetation in trees and plants, even in those located towards the poles and in cloudy regions, provided the sun rises above the horizon and shows itself in the world. So it is with the light and heat of heaven proceeding from the Lord as the Sun there; for that light is Divine Truth from which angels and men derive all their intelligence and wisdom. It is said therefore of the Word:<p>That it was with God, and was God; That it lighteth every man that cometh into the world. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>; And that this light shineth also in darkness. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_5.htm">John 1:5</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 109</h4><p>109. In this respect a comparison may be made with the heat and light from the sun of this world, which causes vegetation in trees and shrubs even when they are out of its direct rays and under a clouded sky, provided the sun has risen and shown itself in the world. It is the same with the light and heat of heaven from the Lord as the sun, this light being Divine truth, the source of all intelligence and wisdom to angels and men. It is therefore said of the Word:<p>That it was with God, and was God; that it enlightens every man that comes into the world (John 1: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>); and also that that light appears in the darkness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_5.htm">John 1:5</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 109 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>109. Comparatio fieri potest cum calore et luce ex sole mundi, quae vegetationem dat arboribus et virgultis, etiam illis quae ad latera, et quae sub nube, stant, modo sol ortus sit, et in mundo appareat. Ita lux et calor caeli a Domino ut sole, quae lux est Divinum Verum, ex quo omnis intelligentia et sapientia est angelis et hominibus. Quare dicitur de Verbo, <p>Quod erat apud Deum, et erat Deus; quod illuminet omnem hominem venientem in mundum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_109/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_1">Johannes 1:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_109/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_9">9</a>): et quod Lux illa etiam in tenebris appareat (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_109/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_5">Johannes 1:5</a>). </p>
