<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第48节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS48.在其荣耀中的圣言由变像时的主来代表。关于主在彼得、雅各和约翰面前变像，我们读到：</p>
<p>祂的脸面明亮如日头，衣裳洁白如光。有摩西和以利亚显现，同耶稣说话。有一朵光明的云彩遮盖他们，只听见有声音从云彩里出来，说，这是我的爱子，你们要听祂。（马太福音17:1-5）</p>
<p>我被教导，那时主代表圣言；祂那“明亮如日头的脸面”代表祂的神性良善；祂那“洁白如光的衣裳”代表祂的神性真理；“摩西和以利亚”代表圣言的历史和先知书，“摩西”代表他所写的圣言和总体上圣言的历史书，“以利亚”代表圣言的先知书；“遮盖门徒的光明云彩”表示字义上的圣言；因此，只听见有声音从这云彩里出来说：“这是我的爱子，你们要听祂”。因为天上来的一切宣告和答复，无一例外，都是通过最外在的形式，就是在圣言字义中的那种，作出的；它们是通过主在完全中作出的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 48</h4>
<p>48. The Word in its glory was represented by the Lord when he was transfigured.
<p>We read of the Lord, when he was transfigured in the presence of Peter, James, and John, that his face shone like the sun and his clothing became like light; that Moses and Elijah appeared, talking with him; that a bright cloud overshadowed the disciples; and that a voice was heard coming from the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Hear him” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17:1-5</a>).
<p>I have been taught that at this time the Lord represented the Word. His face, which shone like the sun, represented his divine goodness; his clothing, which became like light, represented his divine truth; Moses and Elijah represented the historical and prophetic books of the Word - Moses, broadly, the books written by him and by extension the historical books, and Elijah the books of the prophets; the bright cloud that overshadowed the disciples meant the Word in its literal meaning. So it was from this that they heard the voice say, “This is my beloved Son. Hear him.” This is because all proclamations and answers from heaven, without exception, come about by means of outermost forms, the kind we find in the literal meaning of the Word; they come about in fullness by means of the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 48</h4><p>48. When the Lord was transfigured, He represented the Word in its glory. When the Lord was transfigured before Peter, James and John, we read that “His face shone like the sun, ” that “His garments became as white as the light, ” and that “Moses and Elijah appeared..., talking with Him.” Moreover, that “a bright cloud overshadowed” the disciples, and that they heard “a voice...out of the cloud, saying, ‘This is My beloved Son.... Hear Him!’ ” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17:1-5</a>).<p>I have been informed that the Lord then represented the Word. His face, which shone like the sun, represented His Divine goodness. His garments, which became as white as the light, represented His Divine truth. Moses and Elijah represented the narrative and prophetic portions of the Word — Moses the Word written by him, and in general the narrative portion of the Word, and Elijah the prophetic portion of the Word. The bright cloud that overshadowed the disciples represented the Word in its literal sense. That is why they heard a voice from it that said, “This is My beloved Son. Hear Him!” For all utterances and answers from heaven are always made by means of outmost expressions such as are found in the Word’s literal sense, being made in fullness from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 48</h4><p>48. (6) THE WORD IN ITS GLORY WAS REPRESENTED BY THE LORD, WHEN HE WAS TRANSFIGURED. <p>Concerning the Lord's Transfiguration before Peter, James and John it is said: <p>That His face did shine as the sun, and His raiment became like light; And ... there appeared Moses and Elias talking with Him ... A bright cloud overshadowed the disciples; and a voice was heard out of the cloud, saying This is my beloved Son ... hear ye Him. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17:1-5</a>. <p>I have been informed that the Lord on this occasion represented the Word. His face, which shone as the sun, represented His Divine Good; His raiment, which became like light, His Divine Truth. Moses and Elias represented the historical and the prophetical Word-Moses, the Word written by him, and in general the historical Word; and Elias, the prophetical Word. The bright cloud, which overshadowed the disciples, represented the Word in the sense of the Letter. Therefore, out of this cloud a voice was heard, saying, This is my beloved Son ... hear ye Him, as all declarations and responses are only made by means of ultimates such as are in the sense of the Letter of the Word; for they are made in fulness from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 48</h4><p>48. The Word in its glory was represented by the Lord when He was transfigured. Concerning the Lord as transfigured before Peter, James, and John, we read:<p>That His face did shine as the sun, and His garments became white as the light. That Moses and Elias appeared talking with Him. That a bright cloud overshadowed the disciples; and that a voice was heard out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17:1-5</a>).<p>I have been instructed that the Lord then represented the Word; "His face that did shine as the sun," His Divine good; "His garments that became as the light," His Divine truth; "Moses and Elias," the historical and the prophetical Word; "Moses," the Word that was written by him and the historical Word in general, and "Elias," the prophetical Word; and the "bright cloud that overshadowed the disciples," the Word in the sense of the letter; and therefore a voice was heard from this cloud which said, "This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him." For all utterances and answers from heaven are made exclusively by means of ultimate things such as are in the sense of the letter of the Word. For they are made in fullness, from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 48 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>48. (vi.) Quod Verbum in sua gloria per Dominum, cum transformatus est, repraesentatum sit.- De Domino coram Petro, Jacobo et Johanne transformato legitur, <p>Quod facies Ipsius fulserit sicut sol; vestimenta Ipsius facta sint sicut lux: et quod visi sint Moses et Elias cum Ipso colloquentes: et quod nubes lucida discipulos obtexerit; et quod ex nube audita sit vox, dicens, "Hic est filius meus dilectus, ... Ipsum audite" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_48/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_17_1-5">Matthaeus 17:1-5</a>). <p>Instructus sum quod Dominus tunc repraesentaverit Verbum: per "faciem," quae fulsit sicut sol, Divinum Bonum Ipsius; per "vestimenta" quae facta sicut lux, Divinum Verum Ipsius; per "Mosen et Eliam," Verbum Historicum et Propheticum, per "Mosen" Verbum quod per illum scriptum est, et in genere Verbum Historicum, ac per "Eliam" Verbum Propheticum per "nubem lucidam" quae obtexit discipulos, Verbum in sensu litterae; quare ex hac vox audita est, et dixit, "Hic est Filius meus dilectus, ... Ipsum audite;" omnia enim enuntiata et responsa e caelo, nusquam fiunt nisi per ultima, qualia sunt in sensu litterae Verbi: fiunt enim in pleno ex Domino. </p>
