<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS53.⑵教义必须取自圣言字义并被字义证实。这是因为主只在字义，而非其它地方与人同在，启示并教导他教会的真理。此外，若不在完全之中，主从不做任何事；而正是在字义中，圣言才处在它的完全之中，如前所示（37-49节）。这就是为何教义必须取自字义。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 53</h4>
<p>53. 2. A body of teaching must be drawn from the literal meaning of the Word and supported by it. This is because there and only there the Lord is present with us, enlightening us and teaching us the truths of the church. Further, the Lord never does anything in a way that is less than complete, and it is in its literal meaning that the Word is in its fullness, as explained above [<a href="../ss/37.htm">37-49</a>]. That is why a body of teaching must be drawn from the literal meaning. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 53</h4><p>53. 2. Doctrine must be drawn from the Word’s literal sense and verified by it. That is because there and nowhere else is the Lord present with a person so as to enlighten him and teach him the church’s truths. The Lord also never does anything except in fullness, and the Word is in its fullness in its literal sense, as we showed above. It is because of this that doctrine must be drawn from the literal sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 53</h4><p>53. 2. DOCTRINE MUST BE TAKEN FROM THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD, AND BE CONFIRMED [BY IT]. <p>This is because the Lord is present in that sense with man, and nowhere else, enlightening and teaching him the truths of the Church; for the Lord never acts except in fulness, and the Word in the sense of the Letter if in its fulness, as was shown above; therefore doctrine must be taken from the sense of the Letter. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 53</h4><p>53. ii. Doctrine must be drawn from the sense of the letter of the Word, and be confirmed thereby. The reason of this is that there and not elsewhere is the Lord present with man, and enlightens him and teaches him the truths of the church. Moreover the Lord never operates anything except in what is full, and the Word is in its fullness in the sense of the letter, as has been shown above. This is why doctrine must be drawn from the sense of the letter. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 53 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>53. (ii.) Quod Doctrina ex sensu litterae Verbi haurienda sit, et confirmanda, est quia Dominus ibi et non alibi apud hominem, praesens est, ac illustrat et docet illum vera ecclesiae; et Dominus nusquam operatur aliquid nisi in pleno, et Verbum in sensu litterae est in suo pleno, ut supra ostensum est: inde est quod doctrina ex sensu litterae haurienda sit. </p>
