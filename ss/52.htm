<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS52.由此明显可知，那些阅读圣言却没有教义，或没有从圣言为自己获取教义的人，在每个真理上都完全陷入黑暗。他们的心智游移不定，并倾向于错误，易受异端邪说摆布。事实上，如果这些异端邪说获得了一点人气或权威，而他们自己的名声不会因此陷入危险，那么他们就会接受异端邪说。因为圣言对他们来说，就像没有灯的灯台；他们在自己的幽暗中似乎看到了许多东西，而实际上几乎什么也没看见，因为唯独教义是一盏灯。我看见这些人接受天使的检查，发现他们能利用圣言来随心所欲地证实一切，还发现他们所证实的，都是仰合他们自己的爱和站在他们一边的人之爱的东西。我也看见他们被剥去衣服，这标志着他们缺乏真理。因为在灵界，衣服就是真理。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 52</h4>
<p>52. We can tell from all this that people who read the Word without a body of teaching or who do not get themselves a body of teaching from the Word are in complete darkness about truth. Their minds are wandering and unstable, prone to error and liable to heresies. Such people will in fact embrace heresies if those heresies have gained any popularity or authority and their own reputation is therefore not in danger. For them the Word is like a lampstand without a lamp, and while they seem to be seeing a great many things in their darkness, they actually see practically nothing because a body of teaching is the only lamp. I have seen people like this examined by angels, and it was found that they can use the Word to justify whatever they choose; and the things they justify are those that appeal to their self-centeredness and their love for people who are on their side. I have also seen them stripped of their clothing, a sign of their lack of truths. In that world, truths are clothing. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 52</h4><p>52. It can be seen from this that people who read the Word apart from doctrine, or who do not acquire for themselves doctrine from the Word, are in darkness as regards any truth, and that their minds meander and are unsure, prone to error, and moreover are open to heresies, which they embrace if bias or authority favors them and their reputation is not endangered. For the Word is for them like a lampstand without light, and in the darkness they seem to see much, and yet see scarcely anything, inasmuch as doctrine alone is the lamp.<p>I have seen people of this character examined by angels and found to be able to affirm from the Word whatever they will, and to affirm whatever accords with their love and with the love of those whom they favor. I have also seen them stripped of their clothing, a sign that they were without truths. Garments in that world are truths. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 52</h4><p>52. It may therefore be evident that those who read the Word without doctrine, or who do not procure for themselves doctrine from the Word, are in obscurity concerning every truth. Their minds are wavering and unsettled, liable to errors and prone to heresies, which they also embrace if these are held in favour and supported by authority, and if their own reputation is not endangered. The Word to them is like a lampstand without a light, and they see many things, as it were, in the shade, yet understanding hardly anything, for doctrine alone is that which enlightens. I have seen such persons being examined by angels, and they appeared able to confirm from the Word whatever opinion they pleased, and to confirm what pertained to their own self-love and the love of those whom they befriended. But I have also seen them stripped of their garments, a sign that they were destitute of truths; for garments in the spiritual world are truths. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 52</h4><p>52. From all this it is evident that they who read the Word without doctrine, or who do not acquire for themselves doctrine from the Word, are in obscurity as to every truth, and that their minds are wavering and uncertain, prone to errors, and pliant to heresies, which they also embrace wherever inclination or authority favors, and their reputation is not endangered. For the Word is to them like a lampstand without a lamp, and in their gloom they seem to see many things, and yet see scarcely anything, for doctrine alone is a lamp. I have seen such persons examined by angels, and found to be able to confirm from the Word whatever they please, and it was also found that they confirm what is of their own love and of the love of those whom they favor. And I have seen them stripped of their garments, a sign that they were devoid of truths; for in the spiritual world garments are truths. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 52 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>52. Ex his constare potest quod qui Verbum absque doctrina legunt, aut qui non ex Verbo sibi doctrinam comparant, sint in obscuro de omni veritate; et quod mens eorum sit vaga et incerta, prona in errores, et quoque facilis ad haereses, quas etiam amplectuntur, si favor aut auctoritas aspirat, et fama non periclitatur: est enim Verbum illis sicut candelabrum absque lumine, ac vident in umbra tanquam multa, et tamen vident vix aliquid, nam sola doctrina est lucerna. Vidi tales exploratos ab angelis, ac inventos quod confirmare possent ex Verbo quodcunque volunt, et quod confirment quae sunt amoris sui, et amoris illorum quibus favent; et vidi illos nudatos vestibus, signum quod essent absque veris: vestes ibi sunt vera. </p>
