<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第40节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS40.圣言字义的真理在很大程度上并非裸露的真理，只是真理的表象，就像取自存在于自然界中的那类事物的比喻和对比，因而被改编并适应简单人和小孩子的理解。但它们因是对应，故是纯正真理的容器和住处，就像收集和盛纳某种东西的器皿，如盛美酒的水晶杯，盛美味的银盘。它们还像所穿的衣服，如婴儿的襁褓，少女的漂亮裙子；又像属世人的记忆知识，这些知识包含了对属灵人的真理的感知和情感在自己里面。被收集、盛纳和包裹的裸露真理本身，就在圣言的属灵意义里面；而裸露的良善在圣言的属天意义里面。</p>
<p>这一点需从圣言来说明。耶稣说：</p>
<p>你们这文士和法利赛人有祸了，因为你们洗净杯盘的外面，里面却盛满了勒索和放荡。你这瞎眼的法利赛人，先洗净杯盘的里面，好叫外面也干净了。（马太福音23:25-26）</p>
<p>主在此通过作为容器的最外层说话。祂说“杯盘”，其中“杯”是指酒，“酒”表示圣言的真理；“盘”是指食物，“食物”表示圣言的良善。“洗净杯盘的里面”表示通过圣言洁净属于意愿和思维，因而属于爱和信的内在事物。“好叫外面也干净了”表示以这种方式，外在事物，也就是言行将变得洁净，因为外在事物从内在事物获得它们的本质。</p>
<p>耶稣又说：</p>
<p>有一个财主穿着紫色细麻衣，天天奢华宴乐；又有一个穷人，名叫拉撒路，浑身生疮，被放在财主门口。（路加福音16:19-20）</p>
<p>主在此也是通过作为对应并包含属灵事物的属世事物说话。“财主”表示犹太民族，该民族之所以被称为财主，是因为他们拥有圣言，圣言里面有属灵的财富。财主所穿的“紫色细麻衣”表示圣言的良善和真理；“紫色”表示圣言的良善，“细麻”表示圣言的真理。“天天奢华宴乐”表示他们在拥有并阅读圣言中所获得的快乐。“穷人拉撒路”表示没有圣言的外在人；“浑身生疮，被放在财主门口的拉撒路”表示这些人遭到犹太人的蔑视和弃绝。</p>
<p>“拉撒路”之所以表示外邦人，是因为主爱外邦人，就像爱拉撒路，祂叫拉撒路从死里复活（约翰福音11:3，5，36），称他为自己的朋友（约翰福音11:11），他还与主一同坐席（约翰福音12:2）。从上述两段经文明显可知，圣言字义的真理和良善对隐藏在它的属灵和属天意义中的裸露真理和良善来说，就像容器和衣服。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 40</h4>
<p>40. To a considerable extent, the truths of the literal meaning of the Word are not bare truths but are semblances of truth; like similes and comparisons, they are drawn from the kinds of things that are in the physical world and are therefore adapted and fitted to the comprehension of uneducated people and children. Since they are correspondences, though, they are receptacles and dwelling places for genuine truth, like containers that gather in and hold something the way a crystal goblet holds a fine wine, or a silver plate holds gourmet food. They are like garments that serve as clothing, whether swaddling clothes for babies or attractive dresses for young women. They are also like the information in the earthly mind that comprehends within itself the perceptions of the spiritual self and its affection for truth.
<p>The actual bare truths that are gathered in, contained, clothed, and comprehended are in the Word’s spiritual meaning; and the bare goodness is in its heavenly meaning.</p>
<p>[2] However, this needs illustrations from the Word. Jesus said,
<p>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, because you cleanse the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of extortion and excess. Blind Pharisee, cleanse the inside of the cup and the plate first, so that the outside of them may be clean as well. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>)
<p>The Lord said this using terms from the outermost level, which serve as containers. He said “the cup and the plate”- the cup meaning wine and the wine meaning the truth contained in the Word, the plate meaning food and the food meaning the goodness contained in the Word. Cleansing the inside of the cup and the plate means purifying what lies within us, matters of our will and thought and therefore of our love and faith, by means of the Word. The outside becoming clean by cleansing the inside means the consequent purification of our outer selves - our actions and speech, that is, since these have their essence from what lies within.</p>
<p>[3] Again, Jesus said,
<p>There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and indulged himself in glorious feasting every day; and there was a poor man named Lazarus, full of sores, who was laid on his doorstep. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_19.htm">Luke 16:19-20</a>)
<p>Here too the Lord was speaking in earthly terms that were correspondences and that contained spiritual realities. The rich man means the Jewish people, who are called “rich” because they have the Word, in which there is spiritual wealth. The purple and fine linen of his clothing means what is good and true in the Word, the purple meaning what is good in it, and the fine linen what is true. Indulging in glorious feasting every day means a delight in owning and reading it. The poor man Lazarus means the Gentiles who did not have the Word. Their being scorned and rejected by the Jews is meant by Lazarus being full of sores and laid on the rich man’s doorstep.</p>
<p>[4] The reason Lazarus means Gentiles is that the Lord loved Gentiles the way the Lord loved Lazarus, whom he raised from the dead (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_3.htm">John 11:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_36.htm">36</a>). He called Lazarus his friend (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_11.htm">John 11:11</a>) and Lazarus reclined with him at meals (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_2.htm">John 12:2</a>).
<p>We can see from these two passages that the true and good statements of the literal meaning of the Word are like containers and clothing for the bare truths and goodness that lie hidden in the spiritual and heavenly meaning of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 40</h4><p>40. The truths in the Word’s literal sense are in part not naked truths, but appearances of truth, and are seemingly images and metaphors taken from the kinds of things found in nature, thus which have been accommodated and suited to the comprehension of simple folk, and even to that of little children. However, because they are correspondent terms, they are the receptacles and abodes of genuine truth. They are like vessels enclosing such truths and containing them, like a crystal goblet filled with vintage wine, or like a silver dish containing tasty foodstuffs. Or they are like garments clothing them, as swaddling cloths clothe a baby, or a pretty dress a maiden. They are also like the facts known by the natural self, which embrace within them the perceptions of and affections for truth belonging to the spiritual self.<p>The naked truths themselves which are enclosed, contained, clothed and embraced are those found in the Word’s spiritual sense, and the naked goods are those found in its celestial sense.</p><p>[2] But let us illustrate this with passages from the Word. Jesus said:<p>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees...! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of plunder and intemperance. Blind Pharisee, first cleanse the inside of the cup and dish, that the outside of them may be clean also. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>)<p>The Lord spoke here in terms of outward objects that serve as containers, talking about a cup and dish, but a cup means wine, and wine the Word’s truth, and a dish means food, and food the Word’s goodness. To cleanse the inside of the cup and dish means to use the Word to purify one’s inner qualities, which are those of the will and thought, thus of one’s love and faith. That by this the outside would thus be clean means that thus one’s outward actions would be purified, which are one’s works and words, for these take their essence from the inner qualities.</p><p>[3] Again Jesus said:<p>There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and entertained himself magnificently every day. And there was a certain poor man named Lazarus, who lay prostrate at his gate, full of sores.... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_19.htm">Luke 16:19-20</a>)<p>Here, too, the Lord spoke in terms of natural objects which are correspondent ones and contain spiritual meanings. The rich man means the Jewish nation, called rich because they had a Word that contained spiritual riches. The purple and fine linen in which the rich man was clothed symbolize the Word’s goodness and truth, purple its goodness and fine linen its truth. Entertaining himself magnificently every day symbolizes that nation’s taking pleasure in possessing the Word and reading it. The poor man, Lazarus, means gentiles, who did not have the Word. Their being despised and rejected by the Jews is meant by Lazarus’ lying prostrate at the rich man’s gate, full of sores.</p><p>[4] Gentiles are meant by Lazarus, because the Lord loved the gentiles, as the Lord loved the Lazarus whom He raised from the dead (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_3.htm">John 11:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_36.htm">36</a>). And He calls Lazarus His friend (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_11.htm">John 11:11</a>), and Lazarus reclined at the table with the Lord (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_2.htm">John 12:2</a>).<p>From these two passages it is apparent that the truths and goods in the Word’s literal sense serve as containing vessels and clothing of the naked truth and goodness that lies within the Word’s spiritual and celestial senses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 40</h4><p>40. The truths of the sense of the Letter of the Word are, in some cases, not naked truths, but appearances of truth, being, as it were, similitudes and comparisons taken from such things as are in nature, accommodated and adequate to the apprehension of simple people and children; but because they are correspondences, they are the receptacles and abodes of genuine truth. They are like vessels which enclose and contain, as a crystal cup holds noble wine, or a silver dish nourishing food. They are like garments which serve as clothing, like swaddling clothes for an infant, and comely robes for a maiden. They are also like the knowledge of the natural man, which comprises the perceptions and affections of truth of the spiritual man. The truths themselves unveiled, which are included, contained, clothed and comprised, are in the spiritual sense of the Word, and goods unveiled are in its celestial sense.<p> </p><p>[2] This, however, may be illustrated from the Word: <p>Jesus said: Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees ... for ye. make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and the platter that the outside of them may be clean also. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>. <p>In this passage the Lord spoke by ultimate things which are containants, and used the words "cup and platter." By the cup is meant wine, and by wine, the truth of the Word; by the platter is meant food, and by food the good of the Word. To cleanse the inside of the cup and of the platter signifies to purify the interiors, which relate to the will and thought, and thus to love and faith, by means of the Word. That the outside may be clean also, signifies that the exteriors may be purified; and the exteriors are deeds and words, for these derive their essence from the interiors.<p> </p><p>[3] Again, Jesus said: <p>There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: <p>And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_19.htm">Luke 16:19-20</a>. <p>In this passage also the Lord spoke by natural things, which were correspondences, and contained spiritual things. By the rich man is meant the Jewish nation, called rich because they possessed the Word, which contains spiritual riches. By the purple and fine linen with which the rich man was clothed are signified the good and truth of the Word, by the purple its good, and by the fine linen its truth. By faring sumptuously every day is signified the delight of the Jewish nation in having the Word and reading it. By the beggar Lazarus are meant the Gentiles, who do not possess the Word. By Lazarus lying at the gate of the rich man, full of sores, is meant that the Gentiles were despised and rejected by the Jews.<p> </p><p>[4] The Gentiles are meant by Lazarus, because the Lord loved the Gentiles as He loved Lazarus, whom He raised from the dead, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_3.htm">John 11:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_36.htm">36</a>; who is called His friend, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_11.htm">John 11:11</a>; and who reclined at table with Him, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_2.htm">John 12:2</a>. <p>From these two passages it is evident that the truths and goods of the sense of the Letter of the Word are like vessels, and like the clothing of unveiled truth and good, which lie concealed in the spiritual and celestial senses of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 40</h4><p>40. The truths of the sense of the letter of the Word are in part not naked truths, but appearances of truth, and are as it were likenesses and comparisons taken from things such as exist in nature, and thus accommodated and adapted to the apprehension of the simple and of little children. But being correspondences they are receptacles and abodes of genuine truth; and are like enclosing and containing vessels, as a crystal cup encloses noble wine, and as a silver plate holds palatable food. They are also like garments which clothe, as swathings do an infant, and a pretty dress a maiden. They are also like the memory-knowledges [scientifica] of the natural man which contain within them perceptions and affections of truth of the spiritual man. The naked truths themselves which are enclosed, held, clothed, and contained, are in the spiritual sense of the Word; and the naked goods are in its celestial sense.</p><p>[2] But let this be illustrated from the Word. Jesus said:<p>Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, because ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside thereof may be clean also (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>).<p>The Lord here spoke by means of ultimate things which are containants, and said "cup and platter"; and "cup" means wine, and "wine" the truth of the Word; and "platter" means food, and "food" the good of the Word. To "cleanse the inside of the cup and platter" means to purify by means of the Word the interior things which belong to will and thought and thus to love and faith. "That the outside may be clean also" means that in this way, exterior things, which are the actions and the conversation, will have been made pure, for these derive their essence from the interior things.</p><p>[3] Again, Jesus said:<p>There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in crimson and fine linen, and living in mirth and splendor every day; and there was a certain poor man, named Lazarus, who was laid at his porch, full of sores (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_16_19.htm">Luke 16:19-20</a>).<p>Here also the Lord spoke by means of natural things that were correspondences, and contained spiritual things. The "rich man" means the Jewish nation, which is called "rich" because it possessed the Word, in which are spiritual riches. The "crimson and fine linen" with which he was clothed signify the good and truth of the Word; "crimson" its good, and "fine linen" its truth. To "live in mirth and splendor every day" signifies the delight they had in possessing and reading the Word. The "poor man Lazarus" means the Gentiles who had not the Word; and that these were despised and scorned by the Jews, is meant by Lazarus lying at the rich man's porch full of sores.</p><p>[4] The reason the Gentiles are meant by "Lazarus" is that the Gentiles were beloved by the Lord, as<p>Lazarus, who was raised from the dead was beloved by the Lord (John 11: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_36.htm">36</a>), and is called His friend (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_11.htm">John 11:11</a>), and reclined with the Lord at table (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_2.htm">John 12:2</a>).<p>From the two foregoing passages it is evident that the truths and goods of the sense of the letter of the Word are as vessels and as garments for the naked truth and good that lie hidden in its spiritual and celestial senses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 40 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>40. Vera sensus litterae Verbi quoad partem non sunt nuda Vera, sed sunt apparentiae veri, ac sicut similitudines et comparationes, desumptae ex talibus quae in natura sunt, ita quae accomodata et adaequata sunt captui simplicium et quoque infantum. Sed quia sunt correspondentiae, sunt genuini veri receptacula et habitacula; et sunt sicut vasa quae includunt et continent; quemadmodum poculum crystallinum includit nobile vinum, et quemadmodum patina argentea continet edules cibos; et sunt quemadmodum vestes quae amiciunt, ut fasciae infantem, ac decori amictus virginem: sunt etiam sicut scientifica naturalis hominis, quae in se comprehendunt perceptiones et affectiones veri spiritualis hominis. Ipsa nuda Vera, quae includuntur, continentur, investiuntur et comprehenduntur, sunt in Verbi sensu spirituali, et nuda bona sunt in ejus sensu caelesti. Sed hoc e Verbo illustretur. Dixit Jesus, <p>"Vae vobis, Scribae et Pharisaei, quia purgatis exterius poculi et patinae, interiora vero sunt plena rapina et intemperantia. Pharisaee caece, purga prius interius poculi et patinae, ut sit etiam exterius mundum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_40/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_23_25-26">Matthaeus 23:25-26</a>) <p>Hic locutus est Dominus per ultima, quae sunt continentia, et dixit "poculum et patinam;" et per "poculum" intelligitur vinum, ac per "Vinum" verum Verbi; et per "patinam" intelligitur cibus, ac per "cibum" bonum Verbi: per "purgare internum poculi et patinae," intelligitur purificare interiora, quae sunt voluntatis et cogitationis, ita amoris et fidei, per Verbum; per quod "sic exterius mundum sit," intelligitur quod sic exteriora purificata sint, quae sunt opera et loquela, nam haec ab illis trahunt suam essentiam. Adhuc, Jesus dixit, <p>"Homo quidam erat dives, qui induebatur purpura et bysso, et oblectabat se cottidie splendide: et pauper quidam erat nomine Lazarus, qui projectus ad vestibulum ejus ulcerosus" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_40/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_16_19-20">Lucas 16:19-20</a>): <p>Hic etiam Dominus locutus est per naturalia, quae erant correspondentiae, et continebant spiritualia; per "hominem divitem" intelligitur gens Judaica, quae "dives" vocatur quia habebat Verbum, in quo Sunt divitiae spirituales; per "purpuram et byssum," quibus indutus erat, significatur bonum et verum Verbi, per "purpuram" bonum ejus, et per "byssum" verum ejus; per "oblectare se cottidie splendide," significatur oblectatio quod illud haberet et legeret; per "Lazarum pauperem" intelliguntur Gentes, quae non habebant Verbum; quod illae contemptae et rejectae a Judaeis essent, intelligitur per quod "Lazarus ad vestibulum divitis esset projectus ulcerosus." Quod Gentes per "Lazarum" intelligantur, erat quia Gentes amabantur a Domino, sicut <p>Lazarus, qui a mortuis resuscitatus est, amabatur a Domino (Johannes 11:35-36 [NCBSP: <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_40/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_11_3">3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_40/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_11_5">5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_40/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_11_36">36</a>]); et vocatur Ipsius amicus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_40/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_11_11">11</a>); et accumbebat ad mensam cum Domino (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_40/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_2">12:2</a>). <p>Ex his binis locis patet quod vera et bona sensus litterae Verbi sint sicut vasa et sicut vestes nudi veri et boni, quae in sensu spirituali et caelesti Verbi latent. </p>
