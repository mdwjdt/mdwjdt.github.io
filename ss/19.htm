<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS19.圣言还有一层更内在的意义，被称为属天意义，这在前面（6节）说过；但把这层意义解释清楚几乎是不可能的，因为与其说它落入理解力的思维，不如说它落入意愿的情感。圣言里面之所以还有一层称为属天的更内在意义，是因为从主发出的是神性良善和神性真理，神性良善从祂的神性之爱发出，神性真理从祂的神性智慧发出；两者都在圣言里面，因为圣言是神性发出；正因如此，圣言将生命赋予那些虔诚阅读它的人。等到说明圣言的一切细节里面都有主与教会的一个婚姻，以及由此而来的良善与真理的一个婚姻那一章，我们将论述这个主题。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 19</h4>
<p>19. There is a still deeper level of meaning in the Word, one called heavenly, mentioned briefly in  above. It is almost impossible to extricate this meaning, though, because it is suited not so much to the thinking of our intellect as to the feelings of our will.
<p>The reason this still deeper meaning (the one called heavenly) is present in the Word is that divine goodness and divine truth emanate from the Lord, divine goodness from his divine love and divine truth from his divine wisdom. Both are present in the Word, since the Word is a divine emanation. And since both are present, the Word brings to life people who read it with reverence. This subject will be discussed, though, under its own heading [<a href="../ss/80.htm">80-90</a>], where it will be explained that there is a marriage of the Lord and the church in the details of the Word and therefore a marriage of what is good and what is true. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 19</h4><p>19. The Word contains a still more interior sense, called celestial, which we said something about in no. <a href="../ss/6.htm">6</a> above. But this sense is almost impossible to explicate, as it does not fall so much within the scope of the thought of the intellect as into the affection of the will.<p>The Word contains this still more interior sense, called celestial, because there emanates from the Lord Divine goodness and Divine truth — Divine goodness from His Divine love, and Divine truth from His Divine wisdom. Both are present in the Word, for the Word is a Divine emanation. And because both are present, therefore the Word gives life to people who read it reverently. However, we will say more on this subject in the section where we show that the constituents of the Word all contain a marriage of the Lord and the church, and so a marriage of goodness and truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 19</h4><p>19. There is in the Word a sense still more internal, called the celestial, concerning which something was said above in No. 6; but this sense can be explained only with difficulty, for it does not fall so much into the thought of the understanding as into the affection of the will. There is within the Word a still more internal sense called the celestial because from the Lord proceed Divine Good and Divine Truth, Divine Good from His Divine Love, and Divine Truth from His Divine Wisdom. Both of these are in the Word, for the Word is the Divine Proceeding, and because both are there, therefore the Word imparts life to those who read it reverently. Something, however, will be said on this subject in the chapter where it will be shown that in all the particulars of the Word there is the marriage of the Lord and the Church, and consequently the marriage of good and truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 19</h4><p>19. There is a still more interior sense in the Word which is called CELESTIAL, and of which something has been said above (n. <a href="../ss/6.htm">6</a>); but this sense can with difficulty be made plain, because it does not fall so much into the thought of the understanding as into the affection of the will. The reason there is in the Word this still more interior sense called celestial is that there proceeds from the Lord Divine good and Divine truth, Divine good from His Divine love, and Divine truth from His Divine wisdom; and both are in the Word, for the Word is the Divine proceeding, <sup>1</sup>and it is for this reason that the Word gives life to those who devoutly read it. But this subject will be spoken of in the chapter in which it will be shown that there is a marriage of the Lord and the church, and a derivative marriage of good and truth, in each and every thing of the Word.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;That is, the Divine in the act of proceeding. In the expression "Divine proceeding," "Divine" is not to be understood as an adjective qualifying "proceeding", but "proceeding" is to be taken as a verb (or participle) describing the act which the Divine there performs. Thus the expression does not mean a proceeding which is Divine, but a Divine that is in the act of proceeding forth. "Divine proceeding," thus understood, exactly translates Swedenborg's "Divinum procedens." [Translator] </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 19 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>19. Est sensus adhuc interior in Verbo, qui caelestis vocatur, de quo aliquid supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_19/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_6">6</a>) dictum est; sed hic sensus aegre potest enodari, non enim ita cadit in cogitationem intellectus sicut in affectionem voluntatis. Quod interior adhuc sensus, qui <sup>1</sup>caelestis vocatur, insit Verbo, est quia a Domino procedit Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum; Divinum Bonum ex Divino Amore Ipsius, et Divinum Verum ex Divina Sapientia Ipsius; utrumque est in Verbo, nam Verbum est Divinum procedens: et quia utrumque est, ideo Verbum vivificat illos qui id sancte legunt. Sed de hac re dicetur in articulo ubi demonstrabitur, quod in singulis Verbi sit conjugium Domini et ecclesiae, et inde conjugium boni et veri.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;qui pro "quae" </p>
