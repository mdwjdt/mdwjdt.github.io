<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS46.圣言的字义由会幕的幔子和帷帐来表示。会幕代表天堂和教会，这就是为何耶和华在西乃山上勾勒出它的样式。因此，会幕中的一切事物，如灯台、金香坛、摆放陈设饼或脸饼的桌子，都代表，因而表示天堂和教会的神圣事物。有约柜在其中的至圣所代表，因而表示天堂和教会的至内在之物；刻在两块石版并被保存在约柜中的律法本身表示圣言方面的主。由于外在事物从内在事物获得它们的本质，而外在和内在事物这两者都从至内层获得它们的本质，在这种情况下，至内层就是律法，所以可推知，会幕的一切事物都代表并表示圣言的神圣事物。因此，会幕的最外在事物，也就是幔子和帷帐，因而它的遮盖物和容器，表示圣言的最外在事物，也就是字义的真理和良善。由于所表示的是圣言的这些最外在事物，所以一切幔子和帷帐都是由捻的细麻，蓝色、紫色和染过两次的朱红色线制成的，并绣上基路伯（出埃及记26:1，31，36）。在《属天的奥秘》关于这一章的论述中，我解释了会幕及其中的一切事物总体和具体上都代表并表示什么。那里说明，“幔子”和“帷帐”代表天堂和教会的外在事物，因而代表圣言的外在事物；“细麻”表示来自一个属灵源头的真理；“蓝色”表示来自一个属天源头的真理；“紫色”表示属天良善；“染过两次的朱红色”表示属灵良善；“基路伯”表示对圣言内在事物的保护。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 46</h4>
<p>46. The literal meaning of the Word is symbolized by the veils and curtains of the tabernacle.
<p>The tabernacle represented heaven and the church, which is why its form was outlined by Jehovah on Mount Sinai. Because of this, everything in the tabernacle - the lampstands, the golden altar of incense, the table for the showbread - represented and therefore referred to holy matters of heaven and the church; and the most holy place, where the ark of the covenant was, represented and therefore referred to the very heart of heaven and the church. Further, the actual law written on the two stone tablets and kept in the ark meant the Lord as the Word. Now, since outer things get their essence from inner things, and both outer and inner things get their essence from the very center, which in this instance was the law, everything in the tabernacle also represented and referred to the holy contents of the Word. It then follows that the outermost features of the tabernacle, the veils and curtains that were coverings and enclosures, meant the outermost features of the Word, which are the true and good elements of its literal meaning. Because this is what they meant, all the curtains and veils were made of fine linen tightly woven, and of blue, purple, and double-dyed scarlet [thread], [and were embroidered] with angel guardians (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_26_1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_26_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_26_36.htm">36</a>).
<p>The general and specific symbolism and meaning of the tabernacle and everything in it has been explained in the treatment of this chapter in Secrets of Heaven [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/9593.htm">9593-9692</a>]. It is explained there that the curtains and veils represented outward features of the church and therefore also outward features of the Word. The linen or fine linen meant truth of a spiritual origin, blue meant truth of a heavenly origin, purple meant heavenly goodness, double-dyed scarlet meant spiritual goodness, and angel guardians meant protection for the inner contents of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 46</h4><p>46. The Word’s literal sense is symbolized by the curtains and veils of the Tabernacle. The Tabernacle represented heaven and the church. Its form was therefore shown by Jehovah on Mount Sinai. Consequently everything in the Tabernacle — the lampstand, the golden altar for incense, and the table with showbread on it — represented and so symbolized the sanctities of heaven and the church. Moreover, the most holy place, where the Ark of the Covenant was, represented and so symbolized the inmost constituent of heaven and the church; and the Law itself, written on two tables of stone and contained in the ark, symbolized the Lord in relation to the Word.<p>Now because outward manifestations take their essence from inner components, and both of these from the inmost one, which in this case was the Law, therefore the holy qualities of the Word were also represented and symbolized by all the constituents of the Tabernacle.<p>It follows from this that the outmost constituents of the Tabernacle, which were its curtains and veils, thus its coverings and enclosures, symbolized the outmost constituents of the Word, which are the truths and goods of its literal sense.</p><p>[2] Because they symbolized these outmost constituents, therefore the curtains and veils were made “of fine woven linen, and blue, purple, and scarlet double-dyed, with...cherubim” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_26_1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_26_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_26_36.htm">36</a>).<p>What the Tabernacle and everything found in it represented and symbolized, in general and in particular, is something we explained in Arcana Coelestia (The Secrets of Heaven), in our treatment of this chapter in Exodus. And we showed there that the curtains and veils represented the outer constituents of heaven and the church, thus also the outer constituents of the Word. We showed, too, that the linen, or fine linen, symbolized truth from a spiritual origin; the blue, truth from a celestial origin; the purple, celestial goodness; the scarlet double-dyed, spiritual goodness; and the cherubim, protections for the Word’s inner constituents. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 46</h4><p>46. (4) THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD IS SIGNIFIED BY THE CURTAINS AND VEILS OF THE TABERNACLE. <p>Heaven and the Church were represented by the tabernacle; therefore, the pattern of it was shown by Jehovah on Mount Sinai. Consequently, everything that was in the tabernacle, as the lampstand, the golden altar for incense, and the table on which was the shewbread, represented and therefore signified the holy things of heaven and the Church. The Holy of Holies, where was the Ark of the Covenant, represented and therefore signified the inmost of heaven and the Church. The Law itself, written on two tables of stone and enclosed in the Ark, signified the Lord as to the Word.<p>Now, because external things derive their essence from internal things, and both of these derive theirs from what is inmost, which in the tabernacle was the Law, therefore, the holy things of the Word were represented and signified by all things belonging to the tabernacle. It follows, therefore, that the ultimates of the tabernacle, namely, its curtains and its veils, thus its coverings and its containants, signified the ultimates of the Word, which are the truths and goods of the sense of the Letter. Because such things were signified, therefore, all the curtains and veils were made of fine twined linen of blue and purple, and scarlet double-dyed with cherubim. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_26_1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_26_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_26_36.htm">36</a>. <p>What was represented and signified, in general and in particular, by the tabernacle and everything in it, is explained in the ARCANA CAELESTIA on this chapter of Exodus. It is there shown that the curtains and veils represented the external things of heaven and the Church, thus also the external things of the Word. Further, that fine linen signified truth from a spiritual origin; blue, truth from a celestial origin; purple, celestial good; scarlet double-dyed, spiritual good; and cherubim, the guards of the interiors of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 46</h4><p>46. The sense of the letter of the Word is signified by the curtains and veils of the Tabernacle. The Tabernacle represented heaven and the church, and therefore the form of it was shown by Jehovah upon Mount Sinai. Consequently all things in the Tabernacle - the lampstand, the golden altar for incense, and the table whereon were the loaves of faces - represented and consequently signified holy things of heaven and the church. The Holy of holies wherein was the ark of the covenant represented and consequently signified what is inmost of heaven and the church; and the Law itself written on the two tables of stone and enclosed in the ark signified the Lord as to the Word. Now, as external things derive their essence from internal things, and both of these from the inmost, which in this case was the Law, it follows that holy things of the Word were represented and signified by all things of the Tabernacle. Therefore the ultimate things of the Tabernacle which were the curtains and veils (and thus its coverings and containers), signified the ultimate things of the Word, which are the truths and goods of the sense of the letter. And because these ultimates of the Word were signified,<p>All the curtains and veils were made of fine linen intertwined, of hyacinthine blue and bright-crimson, and of scarlet double dyed, with cherubim (Exodus 26: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_26_1.htm">1,</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_26_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_26_36.htm">36</a>).<p>What the Tabernacle and all things in it represented and signified generally and specifically, has been unfolded in Arcana Coelestia on this chapter of Exodus. It is there shown that the "curtains" and "veils" represented external things of heaven and the church, and therefore of the Word; and that "fine linen" signified truth from a spiritual origin; "hyacinthine blue," truth from a celestial origin; "bright crimson," celestial good; "scarlet double dyed," spiritual good; and "cherubim," guards of the interior things of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 46 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>46. (iv.) Quod sensus litterae Verbi significetur per aulaea et vela Tabernaculi.- Per tabernaculum repraesentatum est caelum et ecclesia; quare forma ejus a Jehovah super monte Sinai ostensa est. Inde per omnia quae in tabernaculo erant, quae erant candelabrum, altare aureum pro suffitu, et mensa super qua panes facierum, repraesentata et inde significata sunt sancta caeli et ecclesiae; ac per sanctum sanctorum, ubi erat arca foederis, repraesentatum et inde significatum est intimum caeli et ecclesiae; et per ipsam Legem inscriptam binis tabulis lapideis, et inclusam arcae, significatus est Dominus quoad Verbum. Nunc quia externa trahunt suam essentiam ab internis, et haec et illa ab intimo, quod ibi erat Lex, ideo sancta Verbi per omnia tabernaculi etiam repraesentata et significata sunt. Inde sequitur quod per ultima tabernaculi, quae erant aulaea et vela, ita tegumenta et continentia, significata sint ultima Verbi, quae sunt vera et bona sensus litterae ejus. Quia illa significata sunt, ideo <p>Omnia aulaea et vela facta sunt ex xylino intertexto, et hyacinthino et purpura, et coccineo dibapho, cum cherubis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_46/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_26_1">Exodus 26:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_46/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_26_31">31</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_46/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_26_36">36</a>). <p>Quid per tabernaculum, et per omnia quae in illo erant, in genere et specie repraesentatum et significatum est, in Arcanis Caelestibus super illo capite Exodi explicatum est; et ibi ostensum, quod per aulaea et vela repraesentata sint externa caeli et ecclesiae, ita quoque externa Verbi; tum quod per "xylinum" seu "byssinum" significatum sit verum ex origine spirituali, per "hyacinthinum" verum ex origine caelesti, per "purpuram bonum caeleste, per "coccineum dibaphum" bonum spirituale, et per "cherubos" custodiae interiorum Verbi. </p>
