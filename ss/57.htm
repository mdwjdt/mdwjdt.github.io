<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS57.⑶然而，要作为教义源头的神性真理只显现给那些被主启示的人。启示（或译为光照）唯独来自主，存在于那些热爱真理，因为它们是真理，并把它们应用于生活的人身上。对其他人来说，圣言里面没有启示。启示之所以唯独来自主，是因为主存在于圣言的一点一画中。启示之所以存在于那些热爱真理，因为它们是真理，并把它们应用于生活的人身上，是因为这些人在主里面，主也在他们里面。事实上，主就是祂自己的神性真理，当这神性真理被爱，因为它是神性真理（并且当得到应用时，它就被爱）时，主就在它里面与人同在。主在约翰福音教导了这一点：</p>
<p>到那日，你们就知道你们在我里面，我也在你们里面。有了我的诫命又遵守的，这人就是爱我的，我也要爱他，并且要向他显现；我要到他那里去，在他那里作我的住所。（约翰福音14:20-21，23）</p>
<p>马太福音：</p>
<p>心里洁净的人有福了，因为他们必得见神。（马太福音5:8）</p>
<p>他们就是那些阅读圣言时处于启示的人，圣言对这些人来说，是发光和透明的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 57</h4>
<p>57. 3. The genuine truth that a body of teaching should have can be seen in the literal meaning of the Word only when we are being enlightened by the Lord. Enlightenment comes only from the Lord and for people who love truths because they are true and who put them to use in their lives. For others, there is no enlightenment in the Word.
<p>The reason enlightenment comes only from the Lord is that the Lord is present in every bit of the Word. The reason enlightenment happens for people who love truths because they are true and who put them to use in their lives is that they are in the Lord and the Lord is in them. In fact, the Lord is his divine truth. When divine truth is loved because it is divine truth (and it is loved when it is put to use), then the Lord is within it for us.
<p>This is actually what the Lord is telling us in John:
<p>On that day you will know that you are in me and I am in you. The people who love me are those who have my commandments and do them; and I will love them and will manifest myself to them. I will come to them and make a home with them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm">23</a>)
<p>And in Matthew:
<p>Blessed are the pure in heart, because they will see God. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>)
<p>These are the people who are in enlightenment when they read the Word, the people for whom the Word shines or glows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 57</h4><p>57. 3. Genuine truth, of which doctrine ought to consist, is apparent in the Word’s literal sense only to people who are enlightened by the Lord. Enlightenment comes from the Lord alone, and it is found in people who love truths because they are true and apply them to useful life endeavors. Enlightenment in the Word is not found in others.<p>Enlightenment comes from the Lord alone because the Lord is present everywhere in the Word. The reason enlightenment is found in people who love truths because they are true and apply them to useful life endeavors is that they are in the Lord and have the Lord in them. For the Lord embodies His Divine truth. When this truth is loved because it is Divine truth — and it is loved when it is applied to useful endeavor — then the Lord is present in the person in that truth.<p>This, too, the Lord teaches in John:<p>In that day you will know that...you (are) in Me, and I in you. He who has My commandments and keeps them, is he who loves Me.... ...and I will love him and manifest Myself to him...and (I) will come to him and make (My) home with him. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm">23</a>)<p>And in Matthew:<p>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>)<p>These are the people who are enlightened when they read the Word, and with whom the Word shines and is translucent. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 57</h4><p>57. 3. GENUINE TRUTH, WHICH IS TO BE THE SOURCE OF DOCTRINE, IS MANIFEST IN THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD ONLY TO THOSE WHO ARE ENLIGHTENED BY THE LORD. <p>Enlightenment comes from the Lord alone and is granted to those who love truths because they are truths, and who apply them to the uses of life; with others, there is no enlightenment in the Word. Enlightenment comes from the Lord alone, because the Lord is in all things of the Word. Enlightenment is granted to those who love truths because they are truths, and who apply them to the uses of life because they are in the Lord, and the Lord in them. For the Lord is His own Divine Truth; and when this is loved because it is Divine Truth-and this is loved when it is applied to use-then the Lord is present in it with man. These things the Lord also teaches in John:<p>At that day ye shall know ... that ye are in me, and I in you. He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he is it that loveth me ... and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him ... And I will come to him and make my abode with him. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm">23</a>;<p>And in Matthew: <p>Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>.<p>These are they who are enlightened when they read the Word, and with whom the Word is lucid and transparent. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 57</h4><p>57. iii. The genuine truth which must be of doctrine appears in the sense of the letter to none but those who are in enlightenment from the Lord. Enlightenment is from the Lord alone, and exists with those who love truths because they are truths and make them of use for life. With others there is no enlightenment in the Word. The reason why enlightenment is from the Lord alone is that the Lord is in all things of the Word. The reason why enlightenment exists with those who love truths because they are truths and make them of use for life is that such are in the Lord and the Lord in them. For the Lord is His own Divine truth, and when this is loved because it is Divine truth (and it is loved when it is made of use), the Lord is in it with the man. This the Lord teaches in John:<p>In that day ye shall know that ye are in Me and I in you. He that hath My commandments, and doeth them, he loveth Me, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him; and I will come unto him, and make My abode with him (John 14:20- <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">21, 2</a><a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm">14:23</a>).<p>And in Matthew:<p>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>).<p>These are they who are in enlightenment when they are reading the Word, and to whom the Word shines and is translucent. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 57 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>57. (iii.) Quod genuinum verum quod doctrinae erit, in sensu litterae Verbi non appareat aliis quam qui in illustratione sunt a Domino.- Illustratio est a solo Domino, et apud illos qui amant vera quia vera sunt, et faciunt illa usus vitae; apud alios non datur illustratio in Verbo. Quod illustratio sit a solo Domino, est quia Dominus est in omnibus Verbi. Quod illustratio sit apud illos qui amant vera quia vera sunt, et faciunt illa usus vitae, est quia illi sunt in Domino, et Dominus in illis. Est enim Dominus Divinum suum Verum; hoc cum amatur quia Divinum Verum est, et hoc amatur quando fit usus, tunc Dominus in illo est apud hominem. Haec etiam Dominus docet apud Johannem, <p>"In die illo cognoscetis... quod vos in Me et Ego in vobis. Qui habet praecepta mea et facit illa, ille... amat Me, ... et Ego amabo illum, et manifestabo illi Me Ipsum; et ad illum" veniam "et mansionem apud illum" faciam (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_57/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_20-21">14:20-21</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_57/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_23">23</a>). <p>Et apud Matthaeum, <p>"Beati mundi corde, quia hi Deum videbunt" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_57/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_5_8">5:8</a>). <p>Hi sunt qui in illustratione sunt cum legunt Verbum, et apud quos Verbum lucet et translucet. </p>
