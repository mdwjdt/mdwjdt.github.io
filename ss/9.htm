<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第9节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS9.（b）这灵义就在圣言的一切事物和每个细节中。最好举例说明这一点。在启示录，约翰说：</p>
<p>我看见天开了，见有一匹白马，骑在马上的称为忠信真实，祂审判、争战都按着公义。祂的眼睛如火焰，祂头上戴着许多冠冕，又有写着的名字，除了祂自己没有人知道。祂穿着溅了血的衣服，祂的名称为神的圣言。在天上的众军骑着白马，穿着细麻衣，又白又洁，跟随祂。在祂衣服和大腿上有名写着，万王之王，万主之主。我又看见一位天使站在日头中，大声呼喊，你们聚集来赴大筵席！可以吃君王的肉，千夫长的肉，壮士的肉，马和骑马者的肉，并自主的，为奴的，小的大的，众人的肉。（启示录19:11-18）</p>
<p>若不通过圣言的灵义，没有人能知道这些事物表示什么；若不通过对应的知识，没有人能知道灵义，因为上面这一切话都是对应，没有一句话是没有意义的。对应的知识教导白马表示什么，骑在马上的，祂那如火焰的眼睛，头上所戴的冠冕，溅了血的衣服，天上众军所穿的白色细麻衣，站在日头中的天使，他们要聚集来赴的大筵席，他们所要吃的君王、千夫长和其他人的肉又表示什么。从《白马》这本小书可以看出这些事物在灵义上表示什么，那里解释了它们，所以没有必要在此进一步解释。这本小书说明，此处描述的是圣言方面的主；祂那如火焰的眼睛、头上戴的冠冕、除了祂自己没有人知道的名字表示圣言的灵义，除了主自己和祂所愿意揭示给的人（马太福音11:27）外，没有人能知道这灵义；还说明，祂那溅了血的衣服表示圣言的属世意义，也就是它的字义，这层意义已经遭到暴行。显而易见，被如此描述的，是圣言，因为经上说，“祂的名称为神的圣言”；同样显而易见，它表示主，因为经上说，骑在白马上的那一位有名写着“万王之王，万主之主”。在教会的末期，圣言的灵义将要被打开，这一点不仅由论到白马和骑在马上的那位的话来表示，还由大筵席来表示，站在日头中的天使都被邀请来赴这大筵席，并吃君王、千夫长、壮士、马和骑马者，并一切自主的为奴的所有人的肉。所有这些话都是空洞无意义的话，也没有灵和生命，除非它们里面有某种属灵之物，就像身体里面有灵魂一样。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 9</h4>
<p>9. 2. There is a spiritual meaning throughout the Word and in all its details. There is no better way to make this clear than by using examples, such as the following. In the Book of Revelation, John says,
<p>I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And the one who sat on it was called faithful and true, and with justice he judges and makes war. His eyes were a flame of fire, and on his head were many gems. He had a name written that no one knew except him. He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God. His armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed him on white horses. He has on his robe and on his thigh a name written: King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Then I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, “Come and gather together for the great supper, so that you may eat the flesh of monarchs and the flesh of commanders, the flesh of the mighty, the flesh of horses and of those who ride on them, and the flesh of all people, free and slaves, both small and great.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-18</a>)
<p>No one can tell what this means except on the basis of the spiritual meaning of the Word; and no one can see the spiritual meaning except on the basis of a knowledge of correspondences, because all the expressions are correspondential, and there is not a word there that does not matter.
<p>A knowledge of correspondences tells us the meaning of the white horse and of the one who sat on it, of the eyes that were like a flame of fire, of the gems that were on his head, of the robe dipped in blood, of the white linen worn by the people of his army in heaven, of the angel standing in the sun, of the great supper to which they were coming and gathering, also of the flesh of monarchs and commanders and the many others that they were to eat.
<p>You may find what these particular expressions mean when spiritually understood in the booklet White Horse, where these expressions are interpreted, so there is no need to give further interpretation here. That booklet shows that this is a description of the Lord as the Word, that his eyes like a flame of fire, the gems on his head, and the name written that no one knew except him mean the spiritual meaning of the Word and that no one knows it except him and those to whom he wills to reveal it [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_11_27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>]; and the robe dipped in blood means the earthly meaning of the Word, its literal meaning, which has suffered violence. It is obvious that the Word is what is being described because it says “His name is called the Word of God”; and it is equally obvious that it means the Lord because it says that the name of the one who sat on the horse was written, “King of Kings and Lord of Lords.”
<p>The message that the spiritual meaning of the Word was to be opened at the close of the church is conveyed not only by what I have just said about the white horse and the one who sat on it but also by the great supper to which all were invited by the angel standing in the sun, so that they might come and eat the flesh of monarchs and commanders, of the mighty, of horses, of those who ride on them, and of all people, both free and slaves. All these expressions would be meaningless words, with neither life nor spirit, if there were nothing spiritual within them like a soul within a body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 9</h4><p>9. 2. The presence of the spiritual meaning in each and every particular of the Word. This can best be seen from illustrations, such as the following. In the book of Revelation, John says:<p>I saw heaven opened, when behold, a white horse, and He who sat on it was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and does combat. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many jewels. He had a name written that no one knew but Himself. He was clothed with a garment stained with blood, and His name is called “The Word of God.” (His) hosts in heaven followed Him on white horses, wearing fine linen, white and clean.... He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written: “King of kings and Lord of lords.”<p>I saw moreover an angel standing in the sun, who cried with a loud voice..., “Come and gather together for the great supper..., that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, both small and great.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-18</a>)<p>No one can see the symbolic meanings of these words apart from the Word’s spiritual sense, and no one can see the spiritual sense apart from a knowledge of correspondences. For the words are all correspondents; no word there is without meaning.<p>A knowledge of correspondences makes plain the symbolic meaning of the white horse and of Him who sat on the horse, of the eyes that were like a flame of fire, of the jewels on the head, of the garment stained with blood, of the white linen worn by His hosts in heaven, of the angel standing in the sun, of the great supper for which all were to come and gather together, and of the flesh of kings, commanders, and several others that they were to eat.</p><p>[2] The symbolic meanings of each of these images may be seen in the short book, The White Horse, where we explained them. We therefore forgo any further explanation of them here. In that short book we showed that the above description is a depiction of the Lord in relation to the Word, that His eyes like a flame of fire, the jewels on His head, and the name that no one knew but Himself mean the Word’s spiritual sense, and that no one knows that sense but the Lord Himself and he to whom the Lord wills to reveal it. We showed as well that the garment stained with blood means the Word’s natural sense, which is its literal sense, to which violence has been done.<p>That it is the Word which is so described is clearly apparent, for we are told that His name is called “The Word of God.” And that it is the Lord who is meant is also clearly apparent, for we are told that the name written of Him who sat on the horse was “King of kings and Lord of lords.”<p>That the Word’s spiritual sense will be revealed at the end of the church is symbolically meant not only by what we have now said about the horse and Him who sat on it, but also by the great supper to which the angel standing in the sun summoned people to come and eat the flesh of kings and commanders, of mighty men, of horses and of those who sit on them, and of all people, free and slave.<p>All of these statements would be meaningless words, devoid of life or spirit, without something spiritual concealed within them, like a soul in its body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 9</h4><p>9. 2. THE SPIRITUAL SENSE IS IN THE WHOLE OF THE WORD, AND IN EVERY PART OF IT. This cannot be better seen than from examples, such as the following: John says in Revelation, <p>I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and He that sat upon him was called Faithful and True; and in righteousness He doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns; and He had a name written that no man knew but He Himself; And He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and His name is called, The Word of God. His armies which were in heaven followed Him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean ... He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords. <p>And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice ... Come and gather yourselves together unto the great supper ... That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-18</a>.<p>No one can see what these things signify except from the spiritual sense of the Word, and no one can see the spiritual sense except from a knowledge of correspondences; for all the words are correspondences and not one word is without meaning. The science of correspondences teaches the signification of the white horse, of Him that sat upon it, of His eyes which were like a flame of fire, of the crowns which were on His head, of His vesture dipped in blood, of the white linen with which they who were of His army in heaven were clothed, of the angel standing in the sun, of the great supper to which they should come and gather themselves, and also of the flesh of kings, captains and many others which they were to eat. <p>What each of these particulars signifies in the spiritual sense may be seen in the little work on THE WHITE HORSE, where they are explained. It is therefore unnecessary to explain them further here. In that treatise it is shown that the Lord is here described as to the Word; by His eyes, which were as a flame of fire, by the crowns which were upon His head, and by the name which no one knoweth but Himself, is meant the spiritual sense of the Word, which no one knows but the Lord Himself and he to whom He wills to reveal it. Further, that by His vesture dipped in blood is meant the natural sense of the Word, which is the sense of the Letter, to which violence has been done.<p>That it is the Word which is thus described is clearly manifest, for it is said, His name is called the Word of God; and that it is the Lord who is meant is also clearly manifest, for it is said the name of Him who sat on the white horse was written, King of kings and Lord of lords. That the spiritual sense of the Word is to be opened at the end of the Church is signified not only by what is said of the white horse and of Him who sat thereon, but also by the great supper to which the angel standing in the sun invited all to come, and to eat the flesh of kings, and of captains, of mighty men, of horses and of those that sat upon them, and of all, both free and bond. All these expressions would be empty words and without life and spirit unless there were something spiritual within them, as the soul is in the body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 9</h4><p>9. ii. The spiritual sense is in all things of the Word, and in every single particular of it. This cannot be better seen than by examples, such as the following. John says in Revelation:<p>I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and He that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns, and He had a name written that no man knew but He Himself, and He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and His name is called the Word of God. And His armies in heaven followed Him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords. And I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried with a loud voice, Come and gather yourselves together to the great supper, that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, and small and great (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-18</a>).<p>What these things signify cannot be known except from the spiritual sense of the Word, and no one can know the spiritual sense except from a knowledge of correspondences, for all the above words are correspondences, and not one word there is without meaning. The knowledge of correspondences teaches what is signified by the white horse, what by Him who sat thereon, what by His eyes that were as a flame of fire, what by the crowns that were upon His head, what by His vesture dipped in blood, what by the white linen in which they were clothed who were of His army in heaven, what by the angel standing in the sun, what by the great supper to which they should come and gather themselves, and what by the flesh of kings, and captains, and others, which they should eat. The signification of each of these things in the spiritual sense may be seen in White Horse, where they are explained, so that it is unnecessary to explain them further here. In that little work it has been shown that the Lord in respect to the Word is here described; and that by His eyes which were as a flame of fire, and by the crowns that were upon His head, and by the name that no one knew but He Himself, is meant the spiritual sense of the Word, and that no one can know it but the Lord Himself and he to whom He wills to reveal it; and also that by His vesture dipped in blood is meant the natural sense of the Word, which is the sense of its letter, to which violence has been done. That it is the Word which is thus described is very evident, for it is said "His name is called the Word of God"; and that it is the Lord who is meant is equally clear, for it is said that the name of Him who sat on the white horse was written, King of kings and Lord of lords. That at the end of the church the spiritual sense of the Word is to be opened is signified not only by what is said of the white horse and of Him who sat thereon, but also by the great supper to which the angel standing in the sun invited all to come, and to eat the flesh of kings and of captains, of mighty men, of horses, and of them that sat on them, and of all both free and bond. All these expressions would be empty words and devoid of spirit and life, unless there were what is spiritual within them, like soul in body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 9 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>9. [(ii.)] Quod sensus spiritualis in omnibus et singulis Verbi sit, non melius videri potest quam ab exemplis; quae sint haec sequentia. Dicit Johannes in Apocalypsi, <p>"Vidi caelum apertum, cum ecce Equus albus, et qui Sedens super eo vocabatur fidelis et verus, qui in justitia judicat et pugnat. Et oculi Ejus... flamma ignis, ac super capite Ejus diademata multa; habens nomen scriptum, quod nemo scit nisi Ipse; et indutus erat vestimento tincto sanguine; et vocatur nomen Ipsius Verbum Dei. Exercitus Ejus in caelo sequebantur Ipsum super equis albis, induti byssinum album et mundum... Habet super vestimento et super femore suo nomen scriptum, Rex regum et Dominus dominorum. Vidi porro unum angelum stantem in sole, qui clamavit voce magna, ... Venite et congregamini ad cenam magnam..; ut comedatis carnes regum, et carnes chiliarchorum, et carnes fortium, et carnes equorum et sedentium super illis, et carnes omnium liberorum et servorum, et parvorum et magnorum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_9/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_19_11-18">19:11-18</a>). <p>Quid haec significant, nemo videre potest, nisi ex sensu spirituali Verbi, et nemo sensum spiritualem nisi ex scientia correspondentiarum; nam omnes voces sunt correspondentiae, et nulla vox ibi est vana. Scientia correspondentiarum docet quid significat "Equus albus," et quid "Sedens super illo," quid "oculi" qui sicut flamma ignis, quid "diademata" quae super capite, quid "vestimentum tinctum sanguine," quid "byssinum album," quo induti qui ab exercitu Ipsius in caelo, quid "angelus stans in sole," quid "cena magna" ad quam venirent et congregarentur, tum quid "carnes regum," et "chiliarchorum," et plurium aliorum, quas comederent. Quid autem singula in sensu spirituali significant, videatur in opusculo De Equo Albo, ubi explicata sunt; quare illa ulterius explicare hic supersedetur. Ostensum est in illo opusculo, quod Dominus quoad Verbum ibi describatur; et quod per "oculos Ipsius" qui sicut flamma ignis, et per "diademata" quae super capite, et per "nomen" quod nemo scit nisi Ipse, intelligatur sensus spiritualis Verbi, et quod nemo illum sciat nisi Ipse Dominus, et cui Ipse vult illum revelare; tum quod per "vestimentum tinctum sanguine" intelligatur sensus naturalis Verbi, qui est sensus litterae ejus, cui violentia illata est; quod sit Verbum, quod ita describitur, manifeste patet, nam dicitur, "Vocatur nomen ejus Verbum Dei;" et quod sit Dominus qui intelligitur, etiam manifeste patet, nam dicitur quod Nomen Sedentis super Equo scriptum sit, "Rex regum et Dominus dominorum." Quod sensus spiritualis Verbi aperiendus sit in fine ecclesiae, significatur non modo per illa quae de Equo et de Sedente super illo nunc dicta sunt, sed etiam per "cenam magnam," ad quam per angelum in sole stantem omnes invitati sunt ut venirent, ac ederent carnes regum et chiliarchorum, fortium, equorum, sedentium super illis, omnium liberorum et servorum. Omnes hae expressiones forent voces vanae, et absque vita et spiritu, nisi spirituale intus in illis esset, sicut anima in corpore. </p>
