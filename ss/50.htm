<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">五、教会的教义必须取自圣言的字义并被字义证实</h4><p>SS50.前一章已说明，字义上的圣言在它的完全、神圣和能力之中；由于主就是圣言，事实上，祂是圣言的全部，所以可推知，祂尤其存在于字义中，并从字义教导并启示人。不过，这些事要按下列顺序来阐述：</p>
<p>⑴没有教义，就无法理解圣言。</p>
<p>⑵教义必须取自圣言字义。</p>
<p>⑶然而，要作为教义源头的神性真理只显现给那些被主启示的人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 50</h4>
<p>50. The Church’s Body of Teaching Is to Be Drawn from the Literal Meaning of the Word and Is to Be Supported by It
<p>THE preceding chapter was devoted to showing that in its literal meaning the Word is in its fullness, holiness, and power; and since the Lord is the Word (because he is everything in the Word), it follows that the Lord is most present in that meaning and that he teaches and enlightens us through it.
<p>I need to present this, though, in the following sequence.
<p>1. The Word is not understandable without a body of teaching.
<p>2. A body of teaching must be drawn from the literal meaning of the Word.
<p>3. However, the divine truth that a body of teaching should have can be seen only when we are being enlightened by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 50</h4><p>50. The Church’s Doctrine Must Be Drawn from the Word’s Literal Sense and Verified by It<p>In the preceding section we showed that in its literal sense the Word is in its fullness, in its holiness, and in its power. And because the Lord embodies the Word — inasmuch as He is the totality of the Word — it follows that the Lord is most present in that sense, and that He teaches and enlightens a person in the light of it.<p>This, however, needs to be demonstrated according to the following outline:<p>1. The Word is not understood apart from doctrine.<p>2. Doctrine must be drawn from the Word’s literal sense.<p>3. However, Divine truth, of which doctrine ought to consist, is apparent only to people who are enlightened by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 50</h4><p>50. V. The Doctrine of the Church must be taken from the sense of the Letter of the Word, and be confirmed by it.<p>It was shown in the previous article that the Word in the sense of the Letter is in its fulness, its sanctity and its power; and since the Lord is the Word, for He is the All of the Word, it follows that the Lord is eminently present in that sense, teaching and enlightening man from it. Proof of this will be given in due order as follows:<p>1. Without doctrine, the Word is unintelligible. <p>2. Doctrine must be taken from the sense of the Letter of the Word. <p>3. But Divine Truth, which is to be the source of doctrine, is manifest only to those who are enlightened by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 50</h4><p>50. V. THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH IS TO BE DRAWN FROM THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD, AND IS TO BE CONFIRMED THEREBY<p>It has been shown in the preceding chapter that the Word in the sense of the letter is in its fullness, in its holiness, and in its power; and as the Lord is the Word (for He is the all of the Word), it follows that He is most of all present in the sense of the letter, and that from it He teaches and enlightens man. But these things shall be set forth in the following order:<p>i. The Word cannot be understood without doctrine.<p>ii. Doctrine must be drawn from the sense of the letter of the Word.<p>iii. But the Divine truth which must be of doctrine appears to none but those who are in enlightenment from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 50 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>50. (V.) QUOD DOCTRINA ECCLESIAE EX SENSU LITTERAE VERBI HAURIENDA SIT, ET PER ILLUM CONFIRMANDA. <p>In praecedente articulo ostensum est quod Verbum in sensu litterae sit in suo pleno, in suo sancto, et in sua potentia; et quia Dominus est Verbum, est enim omne Verbi, sequitur quod Dominus in illo sensu sit maxime praesens, et quod ex illo doceat et illustret hominem. Sed haec demonstranda sunt in hoc ordine:- <p>(i.) Quod Verbum absque Doctrina non intelligatur. <p>(ii.) Quod Doctrina e Verbi sensu litterae haurienda sit. <p>(iii.) At quod Divinum Verum, quod Doctrinae erit, non appareat aliis quam qui in illustratione a Domino sunt. </p>
