<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第95节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS95.字义上的许多事物都是表面真理，有纯正真理隐藏在它们里面；根据这些真理思考和说话不会害人，但确认它们到了摧毁隐藏在里面的纯正真理的地步，就会害人；这一点可通过自然界中的一个例子来说明，举这个例子是因为，属世之物比属灵之物更具教育性和说服力。</p>
<p>表面上看，太阳每天、每年都围绕地球转动；故在圣言中，经上说日升日落，从而带来早晨、正午、傍晚和夜间，还带来春夏秋冬，从而带来天数和年岁。而事实上，太阳是静止不动的，因为它就是一片火海，是地球在每天自转，并且每年绕太阳公转。人若因简单无知而以为太阳围着地球转，不会摧毁属世真理，即：地球每天绕其轴自转，每年沿黄道公转。但人若通过圣言和来自属世人的推理确认太阳的表面运动和轨道是真的，就是在推翻，甚至摧毁真理。</p>
<p>太阳的表面运动是一个表面真理；太阳的静止不动，则是一个纯正真理。人人都可以照着表面真理谈论，并且也的确是这么谈论的；但出于确认而如此思考就会削弱理性理解的能力，使它变瞎。夜空中的恒星也一样。表面真理是，它们和太阳一样，每天绕行星一圈；因此，论到这些恒星，我们也会说它们升起落下。但纯正真理是，恒星都是固定的，它们的天空也是静止不动的。然而，人人都可以照着表象谈论。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 95</h4>
<p>95. There is an example from the physical world that may serve to illustrate the fact that within the literal sense are many semblances of truth that have genuine truth hidden within them, and that it does us no harm to think and talk as though they were true but that it does do us harm to convince ourselves of them to the point of destroying the genuine truth hidden within. I offer this example because something down to earth is more clearly instructive and persuasive than something spiritual.</p>
<p>[2] To all appearances, the sun travels around the earth in a daily cycle and also a yearly cycle, so it says in the Word that the sun rises and sets, causing morning, noon, evening, and night and the seasons of spring, summer, fall, and winter - days and years, therefore. The sun, though, is actually immobile. It is an ocean of fire and the earth rotates every day and orbits the sun yearly. People who simply and ignorantly think that the sun is circling the earth do not destroy the physical truth that the earth is rotating on its axis once a day and is borne along its elliptical path every year. However, if they convince themselves that the apparent motion and course of the sun is its true motion, bringing in support from the Word and the ability to rationalize that is inherent in the earthly self, they undermine the actual truth and even destroy it.</p>
<p>[3] The apparent motion of the sun is a semblance of truth; the immobility of the sun is a genuine truth. We may talk in terms of the semblance, and we do so, but thinking that way with conviction weakens and blinds our ability to think things through rationally.
<p>It is the same with the stars of the nighttime sky. The semblance of truth is that they too circle us once a day, like the sun; so we say of the stars too that they rise and set. The real truth, though, is that they are fixed and that their heaven is immobile. Still, it is allowable for us all to talk in terms of the way things seem to be. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 95</h4><p>95. Many depictions in the literal sense are apparent truths that contain genuine truths concealed within them, and it is not harmful to think and speak in accordance with those apparent truths. However, it is harmful to affirm them to the point of destroying the genuine truth that lies concealed within. This, too, may be illustrated by an example found in nature, which I cite because something natural is more clearly instructive and convincing than something spiritual.</p><p>[2] To our eyes it appears that every day the sun travels around the earth, and does so also once annually. For that reason it says in the Word that the sun rises and sets, that it causes morning, afternoon, evening and night, as well as the seasons of spring, summer, fall and winter, and thus days and years, even though the sun is stationary. For it is a sea of fire, and the earth revolves daily and travels about it annually.<p>A person who thinks in simplicity and ignorance that the sun travels around does not destroy the natural truth, namely, that the earth rotates daily about its axis and moves along its orbit annually.<p>On the other hand, someone who affirms as true the apparent motion of the sun and its course because of what it says in the Word, and does so with arguments originating from his natural self, weakens the truth, and also destroys it.</p><p>[3] The idea that the sun moves is an apparent truth. The fact that it does not move is a genuine truth. Everyone may speak in accordance with the apparent truth, and also does speak so, but to think accordingly with conviction dulls the rational intellect and darkens it.<p>The case is the same with the stars in the sky. It is an apparent truth that they also travel about once daily, like the sun, which is why it is also said of the stars that they rise and set. But the genuine truth is that the stars are fixed, and the sky in which they appear is stationary. Still, everyone may speak in accordance with the appearance. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 95</h4><p>95. Many other things in the sense of the Letter are apparent truths, within which genuine truths lie concealed. It is not hurtful to think and to speak according to such apparent truths; but it is hurtful to confirm them so as to destroy the genuine truth concealed within them. This may be illustrated by an example from nature, adduced because what is natural instructs and convinces more clearly than what is spiritual.<p> </p><p>[2] To the eye, the sun appears to make a daily and also an annual revolution round the earth. Accordingly it is said in the Word that the sun rises and sets; that it causes morning, noon, evening and night; and also the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and consequently, days and years. But in reality the sun is stationary, being an ocean of fire round which the earth, revolving daily, is carried annually. The man who, in simplicity and ignorance, supposes that the sun revolves, does not destroy the natural truth that the earth rotates daily on her axis and makes an annual revolution in the ecliptic. But he who confirms the sun's apparent motion and course by the Word and by reasonings from the natural man, invalidates and even destroys the truth.<p> </p><p>[3] That the sun moves, is an apparent truth; that it does not move, is a genuine truth. Everyone may speak according to the apparent truth, and indeed does so speak; but to think according to it from confirmation (that is it true) blunts and obscures the rational understanding. It is similar with the stars of the starry heaven. The apparent truth is that they also, like the sun, make a daily revolution; and therefore it is said also of the stars that they rise and set. But the genuine truth is that the stars are fixed, and that their firmament is immovable. Nevertheless everyone may speak according to the appearance. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 95</h4><p>95. That many things in the sense of the letter are apparent truths, having genuine truths hidden within them, and that it is not hurtful to think and speak in accordance with such truths, but that it is hurtful to confirm them to such a degree as to destroy the genuine truth hidden within, may be illustrated by an example in nature, which is presented because what is natural teaches and convinces more clearly than what is spiritual.</p><p>[2] To the eye the sun appears to revolve round the earth daily and also annually, and therefore in the Word the sun is said to rise and set, thus make morning, noon, evening, and night, and also making the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and thus days and years; when yet the sun stands motionless, for it is an ocean of fire, and it is the earth that revolves daily, and is carried round the sun annually. The man who in simplicity and ignorance supposes that the sun is carried round the earth, does not destroy the natural truth that the earth daily rotates on its axis, and is annually carried along the ecliptic. But the man who by the Word and by reasonings from the natural man confirms as real the apparent motion and course of the sun, does invalidate the truth and does destroy it.</p><p>[3] That the sun moves is an apparent truth; that it does not move is a genuine truth. Everyone may speak in accordance with the apparent truth, and does so speak, but to think in accordance with it from confirmation blunts and darkens the rational understanding. It is the same with respect to the stars in the sidereal heavens. The apparent truth is that they too, like the sun, are carried round the earth once a day, and it is therefore said of the stars also that they rise and set. But the genuine truth is that the stars are fixed, and that their heavens stand motionless. Still, everyone may speak in accordance with the appearance. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 95 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>95. Quod plura in sensu litterae sint vera apparentia, in quibus vera genuina latent, et quod non damnosum sit secundum (talia) vera cogitare et loqui, sed quod damnosum sit confirmare illa usque ad destructionem genuini Veri, quod intus latet, illustrari etiam potest per exemplum in natura; quod adfertur, quia naturale clarius quam spirituale docet et persuadet. Coram oculis apparet sicut sol quovis die circum tellurem feratur, et quoque semel quotannis; inde in Verbo dicitur quod sol oriatur et occidat; quod faciat mane, meridiem, vesperam et noctem, atque tempora veris, aestatis, autumni et hiemis, et sic dies et annos; cum tamen sol immotus stat, est enim oceanus igneus, et tellus circumvolvitur cottidie, et circumfertur quotannis. Homo qui ex simplicitate et ex ignorantia cogitat quod circumferatur, non destruit veritatem naturalem, quae est, quod tellus cottidie rotetur circum axem, et quotannis feratur secundum eclipticam. At qui confirmat apparentem solis motum et cursum per Verbum, et per ratiocinia ex naturali homine, is infirmat veritatem, et quoque destruit illam. Quod sol moveatur, est apparens verum; quod non moveatur, est genuinum Verum. Quisque potest loqui secundum apparens verum, et quoque loquitur; sed cogitare secundum illud ex confirmatione, hoc intellectum rationalem hebetat et opacat. Simile est cum stellis caeli astriferi: apparens verum est, quod illae quoque semel cottidie, sicut sol, circumferantur; quare dicitur etiam de stellis, quod oriantur et occidant; sed genuinum verum est, quod stellae sint fixae, et quod caelum illarum immotum stet. Attamen potest quisque secundum apparentiam loqui. </p>
