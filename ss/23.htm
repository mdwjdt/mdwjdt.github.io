<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS23.古时，各民族的偶像崇拜就来源于对应的知识，因为地上的一切可见事物都对应于属灵事物；不仅树木，还有各种走兽和飞鸟，以及鱼类等等，都是如此。拥有对应知识的古人为自己造了对应于天上事物的形像，并以之为乐，因为它们表示诸如属于天堂，因而属于教会的那类事物。因此，他们不仅把这些形像摆在圣殿，还摆在家里，但不是为了敬拜，而是为了回想它们所表示的天上事物。所以埃及和其它地方都有牛犊、公牛、蛇，以及孩童、老人和少女的形像。这是因为牛犊和公牛表示属世人的情感和能力；蛇表示感官人的精明；孩童表示纯真和仁爱；老人表示智慧；少女表示对真理的情感，等等。当对应的知识从记忆中被抹去时，他们的后代开始把古人摆放在圣殿里面及周围的形像和雕像拜为神圣，最终视若神明。</p>
<p>其它民族也是如此；如亚设的非利士人所拜的大衮（参看撒母耳记上第5章）。大衮的上半部分像人，下半部分像鱼。这个形像被如此设计，是因为人表示聪明，鱼表示知识，而聪明和知识构成一体。也正因古人拥有对应的知识，所以他们在园子和树林里照着其中的树木种类进行敬拜；还在大山和小山上敬拜。园子和树林表示智慧和聪明，每种树都表示它们的某个具体方面。如橄榄树表示爱之良善；葡萄树表示来自那良善的真理；香柏树表示理性的良善和真理；大山表示最高层天堂；小山表示在它之下的天堂。</p>
<p>直到主降世，对应的知识仍幸存于许多东方人当中，这从东方智者来拜见刚出生的主明显看出来；这就是为何有星在他们前头行，又为何他们带来黄金、乳香和没药为礼物（马太福音2:1-2，9-11）。因为在他们前头行的星表示从天上来的知识；黄金表示属天良善；乳香表示属灵良善；没药表示属世良善；这三者是一切敬拜的基础。</p>
<p>然而，以色列和犹太民族当中根本没有任何对应知识，尽管他们的一切敬拜，通过摩西赐给他们的一切律例典章，以及圣言的一切事物都只是对应。这是因为他们心里是偶像崇拜者，并且具有这种性质：他们甚至不愿知道他们敬拜的任何元素表示属天和属灵之物。也就是说，他们想要这一切事物本身且只为他们而神圣；因此，如果属天和属灵事物被揭示给他们，那么他们不仅会弃绝它们，还会亵渎之。由于这个原因，天堂向他们如此关闭，以致他们几乎不知道还有永生这回事。情况就是这样，这一点从以下事实很清楚地看出来：他们不承认主，尽管整部圣经都在预言祂，并预示祂的降临。他们弃绝祂的唯一原因是，祂教导的是一个天上的国，而不是一个地上的国。因为他们想要的是一位将要把他们高举在全世界所有民族之上的弥赛亚，而不是一位关心他们永恒救赎的弥赛亚。此外，他们声称圣言包含许多被称为神秘的奥秘在里面；但他们不想知道这些奥秘涉及主。然而，当他们被告知，这些奥秘涉及黄金时，他们却很想知道它们。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 23</h4>
<p>23. The idolatrous practices of the peoples in ancient times arose from their knowledge of correspondences because everything we see on our planet corresponds to something spiritual - not only trees, but also all kinds of animals and birds as well as fish, and so on. The ancients who were devoted to a knowledge of these correspondences made themselves images that corresponded to heavenly realities, and they took pleasure in them because they signified what was happening in heaven and the church. That is why they placed them not only in their temples but in their homes as well - not to be worshiped but to remind them of the heavenly reality signified by these objects. So in Egypt and elsewhere their images looked like calves, oxen, and snakes as well as children, old people, and young women. This is because calves and oxen mean the feelings and drives of the earthly self, snakes the shrewdness of the sensory self, children innocence and caring, old people wisdom, and young women the desire for what is true, and so on.
<p>Because the ancients had placed these images and statues in and around temples, their descendants, after the knowledge of these correspondences had been lost, began to worship the images and statues themselves as sacred, and eventually regarded them as demigods.</p>
<p>[2] Much the same happened in other nations - with the Philistines’ Dagon in Ashdod, for example (see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_5_1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-12</a>). The upper part of Dagon looked human and the lower part looked like a fish, an image devised because a human means intelligence, a fish means knowledge, and intelligence and knowledge become one.
<p>This is also why the ancients’ worship was in gardens and groves depending on the species of trees, and on mountains and hills. Gardens and groves meant wisdom and intelligence, and each tree meant some specific aspect of them. Olive trees, for example, meant good actions done out of love; grapevines meant true insights that arise from doing good; cedars meant a rational understanding of what is good and true; mountains meant the highest heaven; and hills meant the heaven below it.</p>
<p>[3] The survival of the knowledge of correspondences until the Coming of the Lord among the greater part of those in the East is demonstrated in the account of the wise men from that region who came to the Lord when he was borns - because in that story a star went before them and they bore gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_1.htm">Matthew 2:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_9.htm">9-11</a>). That is, the star that went before them meant a new insight from heaven; and gold meant what is good on the heavenly level, frankincense what is good on the spiritual level, and myrrh what is good on the earthly level; and these three are the basis of all worship.</p>
<p>[4] There was no knowledge at all of correspondences among the people of Israel and Judah, however, even though correspondence was the sole basis of all their worship, all the judgments and statutes given them through Moses, and all the contents of the Word. This was because they were idolatrous at heart, so much so that they did not even want to know that any element of their worship had a heavenly or spiritual meaning. That is, they wanted all these things to be holy in and of themselves and just for them, so if they had noticed anything heavenly and spiritual, they not only would have rejected it but would have profaned it as well. For this reason heaven was closed to them, so closed that they were scarcely aware that there was such a thing as eternal life. The truth of this is obvious from the fact that they did not recognize the Lord even though the whole Sacred Scripture prophesied about him and predicted him. The sole reason they rejected him was that he taught people about a heavenly kingdom and not an earthly one. That is, they wanted a Messiah who would raise them to supremacy over all the nations in the whole world and not some Messiah who would be concerned with their eternal salvation.
<p>Further, they assert that the Word contains in itself many secrets that they call mystical, but they do not want those secrets to be about the Lord. They do want to know them, though, when they are told that they are about gold. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 23</h4><p>23. The idolatries of the nations in olden times drew their origin from a knowledge of correspondences, and this because everything appearing on the earth has a correspondence, thus not only trees, but also cattle and birds of every kind, as well as fish, and everything else. People of old who possessed a knowledge of correspondences made themselves images that corresponded to things having to do with heaven, and they delighted in them, because they symbolized such things as have to do to with heaven and consequently the church. Therefore they placed these images not only in their temples, but also in their homes, not as objects to be worshiped, but to remind them of the heavenly things they symbolized.<p>Thus in Egypt and elsewhere there were images of calves, oxen, and serpents, and of boys, older men, and maidens, because calves and oxen symbolized the affections and abilities of the natural self; serpents, the prudence of the sensual self; boys, innocence and charity; older men, wisdom; and maidens, affections for truth, and so on.<p>When a knowledge of correspondences was obliterated, the people’s posterity began to worship as holy, and finally as deities, the images and likenesses set up by their ancestors, because they found them in and around temples.</p><p>[2] The case was the same among other nations, such as with Dagon among the Philistines at Ashdod, mentioned in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_5_1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-12</a>. Its upper part had the likeness of a man, its lower part the likeness of a fish. This image was contrived because a man symbolizes intelligence, and a fish knowledge, which form a unit.<p>It was for this reason, too, that people of old worshiped in gardens and groves, in accordance with the trees there, and also on mountains and hills. For gardens and groves symbolize wisdom and understanding, and each tree some aspect of these. For example, an olive tree symbolizes the goodness of love; a vine, truth springing from that goodness; a cedar, rational goodness and truth; while a mountain symbolizes the highest heaven, and a hill a heaven below it.</p><p>[3] A knowledge of correspondences remained among many eastern peoples to the time of the Lord’s advent, and this can be seen from the wise men from the east who came to the Lord when He was born. That is why a star went before them, and why they brought with them gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_1.htm">Matthew 2:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_9.htm">9-11</a>). For the star that went before them symbolized a perception from heaven; gold, celestial goodness; frankincense, spiritual goodness; and myrrh, natural goodness. And all worship springs from these three.</p><p>[4] But still no knowledge at all of correspondences existed in the Israelite and Jewish nations, even though all the components of their worship, and all the judgments and statutes given them through Moses, were nothing but correspondent forms and expressions. That is because they were at heart idolaters, and of such character that they were not even willing to know that anything connected with their worship symbolized something celestial and spiritual. For they wished all their holy forms and expressions to be holy in themselves and in connection with them. Consequently, if the celestial and spiritual contents were to have been disclosed to them, they would not only have rejected them, but would also have profaned them. Therefore heaven was so closed to them that they scarcely knew of the possibility of eternal life.<p>The reality of this is clearly apparent from the fact that they did not acknowledge the Lord, even though the whole of their sacred scripture prophesied of Him and foretold His advent. They rejected Him for the sole reason that He taught them about a heavenly kingdom and not an earthly one. For they wanted a Messiah who would exalt them above every other nation in the whole world, and not some Messiah who concerned Himself with their eternal salvation.<p>They furthermore maintain that the Word contains within it many secrets that they call mystical, although they do not wish to know that these secrets have do to with the Lord. However, they do wish to know when told that the secrets have to do with gold. </p>

The ancients who had a knowledge of correspondences made for themselves images corresponding to heavenly things, and they took delight in them because they signified things of heaven and consequently of the Church. These images, therefore, they set up, not only in their temples but also in their homes, not to worship them but that they might remind them of the heavenly thing which they signified. Thus, in Egypt and elsewhere there were effigies of calves, oxen, serpents, also children, old men and virgins; because calves and oxen signified the affections and powers of the natural man; serpents, the prudence of the sensual man; children, innocence and charity; old men, wisdom; and virgins, affections of truth; and so on. When, however, the knowledge of correspondences was lost, their posterity began to worship as holy, and at length as deities, the images and likenesses set up by the ancients, because these were in and about their temples.<p> </p><p>[2] So, too, with other nations; as with the Philistines in Ashdod, where Dagon was worshipped, concerning which see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_5_1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1</a> to the end. This image in the upper part was like a man, and in the lower part like a fish, and was so devised because a man signifies intelligence and a fish knowledge; and these make one. On account of their knowledge of correspondences also the ancients worshipped in gardens and groves, according to the different kinds of trees growing in them, and also on mountains and hills; because gardens and groves signified wisdom and intelligence, and every tree something that had relation to these. Thus, the olive signified the good of love; the vine, truth from that good; the cedar, rational good and truth; while a mountain signified the highest heaven, and a hill, the heaven beneath it.<p> </p><p>[3] The knowledge of correspondences remained among many eastern nations even until the Coming of the Lord. This may be seen from the story of the wise men from the East, who came to the Lord at His nativity. <p>A star went before them, and they brought with them gifts; gold, frankincense and myrrh. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_1.htm">Matthew 2:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_9.htm">9-11</a>. <p>For the star which went before them signified knowledge from heaven; gold, celestial good; frankincense, spiritual good; and myrrh, natural good; and from these three all worship proceeds.<p> </p><p>[4] Still there was no knowledge whatever of correspondences among the Israelitish and Jewish nation, although all the particulars of their worship, all the judgments and statutes given to them through Moses, and everything contained in the Word were pure correspondences. The reason of this was that they were at heart idolaters and of such a nature that they were not even willing to know that any part of their worship had a celestial and spiritual meaning; for they desired that all those things and things connected with them should be holy of themselves. If, therefore, the celestial and spiritual things had been revealed to them, they would not only have rejected, but would even have profaned them. For this reason heaven was so closed to them that they hardly knew that there was a life eternal. That such was the case is very evident from the fact that they did not acknowledge the Lord, although the whole Sacred Scripture prophesied concerning Him, and foretold Him. They rejected Him for the sole reason that He taught them about a heavenly and not about an earthly kingdom; for they desired a Messiah who should exalt them above all the nations in the whole world, and not one who should make their eternal salvation His chief regard. Moreover, they declare that the Word contains within itself many arcana, <sup>1</sup>which they term mystic; but they have no desire to know that these relate to the Lord. They are, however, willing to know when it is said that they relate to gold.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;Arcanum (plur. arcana), what is shut up, enclosed, from arceo to shut up, and arca, an ark, chest, or box.

<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 23</h4><p>23. The reason why, in ancient times, the idolatries of the nations originated from the knowledge of correspondences, was that all things visible on the earth have a correspondence; not only trees, but also beasts and birds of every kind, and likewise fishes, and all other things. The ancients, possessing a knowledge of correspondences, made for themselves images that corresponded to heavenly things, and delighted in them because they signified things such as belong to heaven, and therefore to the church. They therefore set them not only in their temples, but also in their houses, not to be worshiped, but to call to remembrance the heavenly things they signified. Consequently in Egypt and elsewhere there were images of calves, oxen, serpents, also of children, old men, maidens; because calves and oxen signified affections and powers of the natural man; serpents, the sagacity of the sensuous man; children, innocence and charity; old men, wisdom; and maidens, affections of truth; and so on. When the knowledge of correspondences had been blotted out of remembrance, their descendants began to worship as holy, and at last as deities, the images and emblems set up by the ancients, because they stood in and about their temples.</p><p>[2] So with other nations; as, with the Philistines at Ashdod, Dagon (concerning whom see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_5_1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1</a> to end), whose upper part was like a man, and his lower like a fish. This image was so devised because a man signifies intelligence, and a fish knowledge, which make a one. It was also because they possessed a knowledge of correspondences that the ancients worshiped in gardens and groves, in accordance with the kinds of trees in them; and also upon mountains and hills. For gardens and groves signified wisdom and intelligence, and each particular tree something relating thereto; as the olive, the good of love; the vine, truth from that good; the cedar, rational good and truth. A mountain signified the highest heaven; and a hill, the heaven under it.</p><p>[3] The knowledge of correspondences survived among a number of the orientals, even until the Lord's advent, as is evident from the wise men of the east who came to the Lord at His birth; and this was why a star went before them, and why they brought with them as gifts gold, frankincense, and myrrh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_1.htm">Matthew 2:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_2_9.htm">9-11</a>). For the "star that went before them" signified knowledge [cognitio] from heaven; "gold," celestial good; "frankincense," spiritual good; and "myrrh," natural good; from which three is all worship.</p><p>[4] Nevertheless there was no knowledge of correspondences whatever among the Israelitish and Jewish nation, although everything in their worship, and all the judgments and ordinances delivered them through Moses, and all things of the Word, were nothing but correspondences. The reason was that at heart they were idolaters, and of such a character that they were not even willing to know that anything of their worship signified what is celestial and spiritual; for they desired that all those things should be holy in themselves and in connection with them; so that if celestial and spiritual things had been disclosed to them, they would not only have rejected but would have profaned them. Therefore heaven was so closed toward them that they scarcely knew that there is a life eternal. That this was the case is clearly evident from the fact that they did not acknowledge the Lord, although universal holy Scripture prophesied concerning Him, and foretold His advent; and they rejected Him for this sole reason - that He taught of a heavenly and not an earthly kingdom; for they wanted a Messiah who would exalt them above every other nation in the world, and not a Messiah who cared for their eternal salvation. For the rest, they affirm that the Word contains within it many arcana that are called mystical; but are unwilling to learn that these refer to the Lord; they however are quite willing to learn when it is said that the reference is to gold. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 23 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>23. Quod idololatriae gentium antiquis temporibus ex scientia correspondentiarum traxerint originem, erat ex causa, quia omnia quae apparent super tellure, correspondent; ita non modo arbores, sed etiam pecudes et aves omnis generis, tum pisces et reliqua. Antiqui, qui in scientia correspondentiarum fuerunt, fecerunt sibi imagines, quae caelestibus correspondebant, et illis delectabantur quia significabant talia quae caeli et inde ecclesiae erant, et ideo illa non modo in suis templis sed etiam in suis domibus posuerunt, non adorationis causa sed recordationis rei caelestis quam significabant. Inde in Aegypto et alibi fuerunt in imagine vituli, boves, serpentes; tum pueri, senes, virgines; quia "vituli" et "boves" significabant affectiones et vires naturalis hominis, "serpentes" prudentiam sensualis hominis, "pueri" innocentiam et charitatem, "senes" sapientiam, et "virgines" affectiones veri, et sic porro. Posteri, quando scientia correspondentiarum obliterata est, coeperunt imagines et simulacra ab antiquis posita, quia in templis, et juxta illa, colere ut sancta, et tandem ut numina. Similiter apud alias gentes, sicut apud Philisthaeos in Aschdodo Dagon (de quo <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_23/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_1-samuel_5_1">1 Samuelis 5:1</a> ad fin.), qui superius fuit sicut homo, inferius sicut piscis; quae imago inventa fuit, quia "homo" significat intelligentiam, et "piscis" scientiam, quae unum faciunt. Inde erat quoque antiquis cultus in hortis et in lucis secundum arborum species, tum etiam super montibus et collibus; "horti" enim et "luci" significabant sapientiam et intelligentiam, et unaquaevis arbor aliquid illarum; sicut "olea" bonum amoris, "vitis" verum ex illo bono, "cedrus" bonum et verum rationale, et "mons" significabat caelum supremum, et "collis" caelum sub illo. Quod scientia correspondentiarum permanserit apud plures orientales usque ad adventum Domini, constare potest ex sapientibus ab oriente, qui venerunt ad Dominum cum natus est; quare illis praeivit stella, et illi secum tulerunt dona, "aurum, thus et myrrham" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_23/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_2_1-2">Matthaeus 2:1-2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_23/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_2_9-11">9-11</a>); "stella" enim, quae praeivit, significabat cognitionem e caelo, "aurum" significabat bonum caeleste, "thus" bonum spirituale, et "myrrha" bonum naturale; ex quibus tribus est omnis cultus. Sed usque scientia correspondentiarum prorsus nulla fuit apud gentem Israeliticam et Judaicam, tametsi omnia cultus illorum, et omnia judicia et statuta illis per Mosen data, et omnia Verbi, erant merae correspondentiae. Causa erat, quia illi corde idololatrae erant, et tales ut ne quidem scire vellent quod aliquid cultus illorum significaret caeleste et spirituale: volebant enim ut illa omnia sancta essent ex se et cum illis; quare si illis caelestia et spiritualia detecta fuissent, non modo rejecissent illa, sed etiam profanavissent; quapropter caelum illis ita clausum fuit, ut vix scirent quod vita aeterna daretur. Quod ita sit, manifeste patet ex eo, quod non agnoscerent Dominum, tametsi universa Scriptura Sacra de Ipso prophetavit, et Ipsum praedixit: rejecerunt Ipsum propter illam solam causam, quia illos de regno caelesti, et non de regno terrestri, docuit; voluerunt enim Messiam qui illos super omnes gentes in universo mundo exaltaret, et non aliquem Messiam qui saluti eorum aeternae consuleret. Praeterea affirmant quod Verbum in se contineat multa arcana, quae mystica vocantur, sed non scire volunt quod illa sint de Domino; at scire volunt, cum dicitur quod illa sint de auro. </p>
