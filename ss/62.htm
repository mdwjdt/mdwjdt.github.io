<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">六、圣言的字义使得与主的结合并与天使的联系成为可能</h4><p>SS62.圣言之所以使得与主的结合成为可能，是因为圣言唯独论述主，主因此是圣言的全部，并被称为“圣言”（约翰福音1:14），如《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》所说明的。结合之所以发生在字义中，是因为圣言在字义中处于它的完全、神圣和能力之中，如前面适当章节所说明的（37-49节）。这种结合并未向人显明，而是在对真理的情感和他对真理的感知里面，因而在人对神性真理的爱和信里面。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 62</h4>
<p>62. By Means of the Literal Meaning of the Word We Unite with the Lord and Form a Companionship with Angels
<p>THE reason we have union with the Lord through the Word is that the Word is entirely about him; and it is because of this that the Lord is its entire content and is called “the Word” [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_14.htm">John 1:14</a>], as was explained in Teachings on the Lord [<a href="../lord/1.htm">1-2</a>]. The reason the union takes place in the literal meaning is that this is where the Word is in its fullness, holiness, and power, as was explained previously under the appropriate heading [<a href="../ss/37.htm">37-49</a>]. This union is not something we can see, but it lies within our longing for what is true and our higher perception of it, so it lies within our inner love for and faith in divine truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 62</h4><p>62. The Word’s Literal Sense Makes Possible a Conjunction with the Lord and Affiliation with Angels<p>The Word makes possible a conjunction with the Lord because the Word has the Lord as its only subject, and the Lord is as a consequence the totality of it, and is called the Word, as we showed in The Doctrine Regarding the Lord.<p>Conjunction lies in the literal sense because in that sense the Word is in its fullness, in its holiness, and in its power, as we showed in its own section above.<p>The conjunction is not apparent to a person, but it is present in his affection for truth and in his perception of truth, thus in the love of Divine truth and faith in that truth that he possesses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 62</h4><p>62. VI. By the sense of the Letter of the Word there is conjunction with the Lord, and association with the angels.<p>There is conjunction with the Lord by means of the Word because the Word treats of Him alone; and by it the Lord is the All in all things of the Word, and He is called the Word, as was shown in THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD. There is conjunction in the sense of the Letter because the Word in that sense is in its fulness, its sanctity and its power, as was shown above in its own chapter. The conjunction is not apparent to man; but it is in the affection of truth and in the perception of it, and thus in the love and faith of Divine Truth with him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 62</h4><p>62. VI. BY MEANS OF THE SENSE OF THE LETTER OF THE WORD THERE IS CONJUNCTION WITH THE LORD AND ASSOCATION WITH THE ANGELS<p>The reason why there is conjunction with the Lord by means of the Word is that the Word treats solely of him, and the Lord is consequently its all in all and is called the Word, as has been shown in Doctrine of the Lord. The reason why the conjunction is in the sense of the letter is that in this sense the Word is in its fullness, its holiness, and its power, as has been shown above in its proper chapter. The conjunction is not apparent to the man, but is in the affection of truth, and in his perception of it, thus is in the man's love for and faith in Divine truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 62 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>62. (VI.) QUOD PER SENSUM LITTERAE VERBI SIT CONJUNCTIO CUM DOMINO, ET CONSOCIATIO CUM ANGELIS. <p>Quod per Verbum sit conjunctio cum Domino, est quia Verbum de solo Ipso agit, et per id Dominus est omne in omnibus ejus, et vocatur Verbum, ut in Doctrina de Domino ostensum est. Quod in sensu litterae sit conjunctio, est quia Verbum in illo sensu est in suo pleno, in suo sancto, et in sua potentia, ut supra in suo articulo ostensum est. Conjunctio non apparet homini; sed est in affectione veri, et in perceptione ejus; ita, in Divini Veri amore et fide apud illum. </p>
