<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS4.这就是圣言的性质，为除去人们对此的任何怀疑，主向我揭示了圣言的内在意义。这内在意义本质上是属灵的，就住在属世的外在意义里面，如同灵魂住在身体里面。这内在意义是赋予文字生命的灵；因此，它能为圣言的神性和神圣作见证，甚至使属世人信服，只要他愿意。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 4</h4>
<p>4. To free people from any doubt that this is the nature of the Word, the Lord has revealed to me an inner meaning of the Word, a meaning that is essentially spiritual and that dwells within the outer meaning, which is earthly, the way a soul dwells within a body. This meaning is the spirit that gives life to the letter; therefore this meaning can bear witness to the divinity and holiness of the Word and be convincing even to earthly-minded people - if they are willing to be convinced.
<p>There Is a Spiritual Meaning in the Word, Which Has Been Unknown until Now
<p>THIS will be presented in the following sequence.
<p>1. What the spiritual meaning is.
<p>2. This spiritual meaning is throughout the Word and in all its details.
<p>3. The spiritual meaning is what makes the Word divinely inspired and makes every word in it holy.
<p>4. This meaning has not been recognized before.
<p>5. From now on it can be given only to people who are focused on genuine truths that come from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 4</h4><p>4. Lest people remain in doubt, therefore, that such is the nature of the Word, the Lord has revealed to me the internal meaning of the Word, one that in its essence is spiritual, which is present in the outward, natural meaning, like a soul in its body. That meaning is the spirit which gives life to the letter. Consequently it is that meaning which can testify to the Divinity and holiness of the Word, and convince even the natural man, if he is willing to be convinced.<p>The Word Contains a Spiritual Meaning, One Previously Unknown<p>[4 repeated.] This will be discussed according to the following outline:<p>1. What the spiritual meaning is.<p>2. The presence of this meaning in each and every particular of the Word.<p>3. That this is what causes the Word to be Divinely inspired and holy in every word.<p>4. That this meaning has been previously unknown.<p>5. And that it is granted after this only to someone who possesses genuine truths from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 4</h4><p>4. Lest, therefore, men should be in doubt that the Word is of this nature, the Lord has revealed to me its internal sense. This in its essence is spiritual, and resides in the external sense which is natural, as the soul in the body. This internal sense is the spirit which gives life to the Letter; and it can therefore bear witness to the divinity and holiness of the Word, and it can convince even the natural man, if he is willing to be convinced. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 4</h4><p>4. Therefore in order to remove all doubt as to such being the character of the Word, the Lord has revealed to me the Word's internal sense. In its essence this sense is spiritual, and in relation to the external sense, which is natural, is as soul is to body. This sense is the spirit which gives life to the letter; it can therefore bear witness to the divinity and holiness of the Word, and convince even the natural man, if he is willing to be convinced. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 4 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>4. Ne itaque homo in dubio esset, quin Verbum tale sit, revelatus mihi est a Domino sensus internus Verbi, qui in sua essentia est spiritualis, qui sensui externo, qui est naturalis, inest, sicut anima corpori; ille sensus est spiritus qui vivificat litteram: quare ille sensus potest de Verbi Divinitate et Sanctitate testari, et convincere etiam hominem naturalem, si vult convinci. </p>
