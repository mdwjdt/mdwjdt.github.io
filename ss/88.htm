<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS88.由于圣言的每一个细节里面都有主与教会的婚姻，或也可说，神性良善与神性真理的婚姻，所以在许多地方，经上都提到“耶和华”和“神”，还提到“耶和华”和“以色列的圣者”，好像他们是两位，尽管他们为一；事实上，“耶和华”表示神性良善方面的主，“神”和“以色列的圣者”表示神性真理方面的主。在圣言的许多地方，经上都提到“耶和华”和“神”，以及“耶和华”和“以色列的圣者”，尽管这两位是一位，就是主，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》（34，38，46节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 88</h4>
<p>88. Because of the marriage of the Lord with the church in the details of the Word (or because of the marriage of divine goodness and divine truth, which is the same thing), in many passages it says “Jehovah” and “God, ” and “Jehovah” and “the Holy One of Israel” as though they were two when in fact they are one. In fact, “Jehovah” means the Lord with respect to his divine goodness and “God” [and “the Holy One of Israel”] mean the Lord with respect to his divine truth. See <a href="../lord/34.htm">Teachings on the Lord 34</a>, <a href="../lord/38.htm">38</a>, and <a href="../lord/46.htm">46</a> for many occurrences in the Word of “Jehovah” and “God” and of “Jehovah” and “the Holy One of Israel” when the intent is to communicate that the two are one, who is the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 88</h4><p>88. To express the marriage of the Lord and the church, or in other words, to express the marriage of Divine goodness and Divine truth present in every particular of the Word, we find in many places the expressions Jehovah and God, or Jehovah and the Holy One of Israel, as though they were two entities, even though they are the same one. For Jehovah means the Lord in relation to Divine goodness, while God and the Holy One of Israel mean the Lord in relation to Divine truth.<p>The fact that Jehovah and God, or Jehovah and the Holy One of Israel, are mentioned in many places in the Word, and yet mean the same God, who is the Lord, may be seen in <a href="../lord/34.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord 34</a>, <a href="../lord/38.htm">38</a> and <a href="../lord/46.htm">46</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 88</h4><p>88. On account of the marriage of the Lord with the Church, or what is the same, the marriage of Divine Good and Divine Truth, in every part of the Word, Jehovah and God, and also Jehovah and the Holy One of Israel, so frequently occur, as if they were two, when yet they are one. For by Jehovah is meant the Lord as to Divine Good, and by God the Lord as to Divine Truth. Although Jehovah and God, and Jehovah and the Holy One of Israel, are spoken of in many passages in the Word, still one only is meant, and He is the Lord, as may be seen in <a href="../lord/34.htm">THE DOCTRINE CONCERNING THE LORD 34</a>, <a href="../lord/38.htm">38</a>, <a href="../lord/46.htm">46</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 88</h4><p>88. On account of the marriage of the Lord with the church, or what is the same, on account of the marriage of Divine good and Divine truth in each and every thing of the Word, "Jehovah" and "God," and also "Jehovah" and the "Holy One of Israel," are mentioned in very many places as if they were two although they are one, for by "Jehovah" is meant the Lord as to Divine good, and by "God" and the "Holy One of Israel" the Lord as to Divine truth. That "Jehovah" and "God," and also "Jehovah" and the "Holy One of Israel," are mentioned in very many places in the Word although one is meant, who is the Lord, may be seen in Doctrine of the Lord (n. <a href="../ss/34.htm">34</a>, <a href="../ss/38.htm">38</a>, <a href="../ss/46.htm">46</a>). </p>

Propter conjugium Domini cum ecclesia, seu quod idem est, propter conjugium Divini Boni et Divini Veri, in singulis Verbi, permultis in locis dicitur Jehovah et Deus, ac Jehovah et sanctus Israelis, sicut forent duo, cum tamen unum sunt; per "Jehovam" enim intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum, et per "Deum," (et per "Sanctum Israelis," <sup>1</sup>) Dominus quoad Divinum Verum.
