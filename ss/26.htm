<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第26节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS26.（e）从今以后，圣言的灵义只赐给那些专注于来自主的纯正真理之人。这是因为，若不靠着主，并专注于来自祂的纯正真理，没有人能看见灵义。因为圣言的灵义唯独论述主及其国度，并且是吸引祂在天上的天使的那层意义，其实就是祂在天上的神性真理。世人若拥有对应的知识，并试图以自己的聪明利用这种知识来探究圣言的灵义，就会向它施暴。因为他们可能用自己所熟悉的某种对应来扭曲灵义，甚至强迫它支持虚假，这将是向神性真理和天堂施暴。因此，如果有人打算凭自己，而不是靠着主打开灵义，天堂就会向他关闭；一旦天堂关闭，这个人要么什么也看不见，要么丧失属灵的理智，在灵性上变得疯狂。</p>
<p>另一个原因是，主通过圣言教导每个人，并且利用这个人已经掌握的真理来教导，而不是直接灌输新真理。这意味着，如果人不专注于神性真理，或他所掌握的少数真理被虚假缠住，那么他可能会利用这少数真理来扭曲真理。众所周知，每个异端分子在利用圣言字义时，就会发生这种情况。因此，为防止有人进入圣言的灵义，或扭曲属于灵义的纯正真理，主派驻了守卫；在圣言中，这些守卫由天使基路伯来表示。</p>
<p>派驻这些守卫以下列方式呈现给我：我被允许看到一些大钱袋，它们看似麻袋，里面装了大量银钱。钱袋打开了，似乎任何人都能取出里面的银钱，甚至偷走。然而，有两位身为守卫的天使坐在这些钱袋旁边。放钱袋的地方，看似马厩里的一个马槽。在隔壁的房间，只见一些谦逊的少女和一位贞洁的妻子在一起；这个房间附近站着两个小孩子。我被告知，不要以孩子的方式，而要智慧地与他们玩耍。之后有一个妓女，以及一匹躺着的死马出现了。</p>
<p>看到这一切，我被告知，它们代表圣言的字义，其中包含灵义。装满银钱的大钱袋表示关于真理的知识的充足或大量供应。钱袋被打开，但由天使守卫，表示谁都可以从圣言获得关于真理的知识，但要当心有人歪曲灵义，因为灵义里面只有真理。放钱袋的马厩里的马槽，表示属灵教导，这种教导是为了理解力。马槽之所以具有这样的含义，是因为从马槽喂养的马表示理解力。</p>
<p>出现在隔壁房间里的谦逊少女表示对真理的情感，贞洁的妻子表示良善与真理的结合。小孩子表示里面的智慧的纯真。他们是来自第三层天堂的天使，看上去都像小孩子。妓女和死马一起表示如今许多人对圣言的歪曲，这种歪曲导致对真理的一切理解的灭亡。妓女表示歪曲，死马表示对真理的理解的完全缺乏。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 26</h4>
<p>26. 5. From now on the spiritual meaning of the Word can be given only to people who are focused on genuine truths that come from the Lord. This is because we cannot see the spiritual meaning unless we are given it by the Lord alone and unless we focus on genuine truths from him. The spiritual meaning of the Word is all about the Lord and his kingdom, and is the meaning that engages his angels in heaven. It is actually his divine truth there. We can do violence to it if we have some knowledge of correspondences and try to use that knowledge to explore the spiritual meaning of the Word with our own brain power. This is because we can distort that meaning with the few correspondences familiar to us and twist them to support what is actually false. This would be doing violence to both divine truth and heaven. So if our efforts to open that meaning come from ourselves and not from the Lord, heaven is closed to us; and once it is closed, we either see nothing or lose our spiritual sanity.</p>
<p>[2] Another reason is that the Lord teaches everyone by means of the Word; and he teaches using the truths that we have and does not pour new truths directly in. This means that if we are not focused on divine truths or if the few we have are tangled in distortions, we can use these few to distort truths. This, as is commonly known, is what happens with heretics in their use of the literal sense of the Word. So to keep anyone from gaining access to the spiritual meaning of the Word or from distorting the genuine truth of that meaning, the Lord has stationed the guards meant in the Word by the angel guardians.</p>
<p>[3] This is how the stationing of those guardians was represented to me:
<p>I was shown some big purses that looked like bags, in which an ample supply of silver was stored; and since they were open, it seemed as though anyone could take out the silver stored in them - could in fact steal it. However, there were two angels sitting near the purses, serving as guards. The place where the purses were stored looked like a manger in a stable. In a nearby room I could see some modest young women together with a chaste wife. There were two little children standing near the room. I was told that I was to play with them, but wisely, not childishly. After that a prostitute appeared, and then a horse lying dead.</p>
<p>[4] After I had seen all this, I was told that this scene represented the literal meaning of the Word in which spiritual meaning was contained. The big purses full of silver meant an abundant supply of knowledge about what is true. Their being open but guarded by angels meant that anyone could draw knowledge of truth from them but care had to be taken to prevent anyone from distorting the spiritual meaning, in which there was nothing but truths. The manger in the stable where the purses were meant spiritual teaching for the sake of our understanding. That is what a manger means because horses, which eat from mangers, mean an understanding.</p>
<p>[5] The modest young women whom I saw in the nearby room meant desire for what is true, and the chaste wife meant the union of good actions and truth. The little children meant an innocence of wisdom within. They were angels from the third heaven, all of whom look like little children. The prostitute with the dead horse meant the distortion of the Word by so many people nowadays, a distortion that leads to the death of all understanding of truth - the prostitute meaning the distortion and the dead horse the total absence of any understanding of truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 26</h4><p>26. 5. The Word’s spiritual meaning is granted after this only to someone who possesses genuine truths from the Lord. The reason is this: because no one can see the spiritual meaning unless he is enabled to do so by the Lord alone, and unless he possesses genuine truths from Him. For the Word’s spiritual meaning deals with the Lord alone and His kingdom, and that sense is the one possessed by His angels in heaven. It is, indeed, His Divine truth there. It is possible for a person to violate that truth if he has a knowledge of correspondences and tries to use it to explore the Word’s spiritual meaning in accord with his own intelligence. Applying some of the correspondences he knows, he may twist its meaning and use it to confirm even falsity, which would be to do injury to Divine truth, and to heaven as well. If someone tries to lay open that sense on his own, therefore, and not from the Lord, heaven is closed, and when heaven is closed, a person either sees nothing, or he becomes spiritually irrational.</p><p>[2] There is also another reason. Because the Lord teaches everyone by means of the Word, and teaches him in accordance with the truths the person already possesses and does not infuse new truths directly, therefore if the person is without any Divine truths, or if he possesses only a few truths and is caught up at the same time in falsities, it would be possible for him to use those falsities to falsify the truths — as is also commonly known to be the case with every heretic as regards just the Word’s literal sense.<p>Consequently, to keep people from entering into the Word’s spiritual meaning, or from twisting the genuine truth found in that sense, the Lord has set protections, meant in the Word by cherubim.</p><p>[3] That protections have been set was represented to me in the following way:<p>I was given to see large purses, looking like sacks, which had stored away in them a great deal of silver. Since they were open, it seemed as if anyone might take some of the silver deposited in them, even to make off with it. However, next to the purses two angels were sitting as guards. The place where the purses rested looked like a manger in a stable. In the next room I saw modest maidens, together with a chaste wife. Near that room were two little children, and I heard it said they were not to be played with in a childish way, but wisely. Afterward a harlot appeared, then a horse lying dead.<p>4] On seeing these images I was informed that they represented the literal meaning of the Word, which has a spiritual meaning within. The large purses full of silver symbolized concepts of truth there in great abundance. The purses’ being open and yet guarded by angels symbolized that anyone might draw concepts of truth there, but that people should take care not to falsify the spiritual meaning, which contains only truths. The manger in the stable where the purses were sitting symbolized spiritual instruction for the intellect. (A manger has this symbolism, because a horse, which feeds from it, symbolizes the intellect.)<p>5] The modest maidens I saw in the next room symbolized affections for truth, and the chaste wife the conjunction of truth and good. The little children symbolized the innocence of the wisdom in it (they were angels from the third heaven, all of whom appear like little children). The harlot together with the dead horse symbolized the falsification of the Word by many people today, by which all understanding of the truth has been extinguished. (A harlot symbolizes falsification, and a dead horse no understanding of truth.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 26</h4><p>26. 5. HENCEFORTH THE SPIRITUAL SENSE OF THE WORD WILL BE MADE KNOWN ONLY TO THOSE WHO ARE IN GENUINE TRUTHS FROM THE LORD. <p>This is because no one is able to see the spiritual sense except from the Lord alone, and unless he is in Divine truths from the Lord. For the spiritual sense treats only of the Lord and of His kingdom; and in the understanding of that sense are His angels in heaven, for that sense is the Divine Truth there. Man can violate Divine Truth, if he has a knowledge of correspondences and by it proceeds to explore the spiritual sense of the Word from his own intelligence; since by a few correspondences known to him he may pervert the spiritual sense, and even force it to confirm what is false. This would be to offer violence to Divine Truth, and also to heaven. Therefore, if anyone desires to discover that sense from himself and not from the Lord, heaven is closed to him; and when heaven is closed he either sees no truth, or becomes spiritually insane.<p> </p><p>[2] This is also because the Lord teaches everyone by means of the Word. Moreover, He teaches from those truths which a man already possesses: He does not directly impart new truths. Therefore, if a man is not principled in Divine truths, or if he has only acquired a few truths as well as falsities he may by their means falsify the truths. This is done by every heretic with regard to the sense of the Letter of the Word, as is well known. Lest therefore anyone should enter into the spiritual sense of the Word, and pervert genuine truth which belongs to that sense, guards are placed over it by the Lord, and guards in the Word are meant by the cherubim.<p> </p><p>[3] That guards were so placed was represented to me in the following manner: <p>"It was granted me to see large money-bags, in appearance like sacks, in which silver was stored up in great abundance; and as these were open, it seemed as if anyone might take out, or even steal, the silver deposited there; but near those bags sat two angels as guards. The place where the bags were laid looked like a manger in a stable. In an adjoining room were seen some modest maidens, in the company of a chaste married woman. Near the room were standing two children, who, I was told, were not to be played with as children but as wise persons.<p> </p><p>[4] Then there appeared a harlot, and a horse lying dead. When I had seen these things, I was informed that they represented the sense of the Letter of the Word, within which is the spiritual sense. The large money-bags full of silver signified cognitions of truth in great abundance. The fact that they were open and yet guarded by angels, signified that everyone might take from them cognitions of truth, but that care must be taken lest anyone should violate the spiritual sense, in which are pure truths. The manger in the stable in which the purses lay signified spiritual instruction for the understanding. This is the signification of a manger, for a horse which eats from its signifies the understanding. The modest maidens who were seen in the adjoining room signified affections of truth; the chaste married woman, the conjunction of good and truth; and the children signified the innocence of wisdom therein. They were angels from the third heaven, who all appear like little children. The harlot, with the dead horse, represented the falsification of the Word by many at the present day, by which all understanding of truth perishes; a harlot signified falsification, and a dead horse, an understanding dead to all truth." <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;This passage is in quotation marks in the Original, and repeated elsewhere.

<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 26</h4><p>26. v. Henceforth the spiritual sense of the Word will be imparted solely to him who from the Lord is in genuine truths. The reason of this is that no one can see the spiritual sense except from the Lord alone, nor unless from Him he is in genuine truths. For the spiritual sense of the Word treats solely of the Lord and His kingdom; and this is the sense in which are His angels in heaven, for it is His Divine truth there. To this sense a man can do violence if he has a knowledge of correspondences, and wishes by means of it and from self-intelligence to investigate the spiritual sense of the Word. For through some correspondences with which he is acquainted he may pervert the meaning of it, and may even force it to confirm what is false, and this would be doing violence to Divine truth, and also to heaven. And therefore if anyone purposes to open that sense from himself and not from the Lord, heaven is closed; and then the man either sees nothing, or else becomes spiritually insane.</p><p>[2] Another reason is that the Lord teaches everyone by means of the Word, and He teaches from those truths which the man already has, and not without a medium does He pour new truths in, so that unless man is in Divine truths, or if he is only in a few truths and at the same time in falsities, he may from these falsify the truths, as it is well known is done by every heretic in regard to the Word's sense of the letter. Therefore in order to prevent anybody from entering into the spiritual sense of the Word, or from perverting the genuine truth that belongs to that sense, guards have been set by the Lord, which in the Word are meant by the cherubim.</p><p>[3] That guards have been set has been represented to me in the following manner:<p>It was granted me to see great purses, having the appearance of sacks, in which silver was stored up in great abundance. As the purses were open, it seemed as if anyone might take out, and even pillage, the silver therein deposited; but near those purses sat two angels as guards. The place where the purses were laid appeared like a manger in a stable. In an adjoining apartment were seen modest maidens together with a chaste wife, and near that apartment stood two little children, and it was said that they were to be sported with, not in childish fashion, but wisely. After this there appeared a harlot, and a horse lying dead.</p><p>[4] On seeing these things I was instructed that by them was represented the sense of the letter of the Word, in which is the spiritual sense. The large purses full of silver, signified knowledges of truth in great abundance. Their being open and yet guarded by angels, signified that everyone may get knowledges of truth from the Word, but that care is taken lest anyone should falsify the spiritual sense, in which are pure truths. The manger in a stable in which the purses lay, signified spiritual instruction for the understanding - a manger signifies this because the horse that feeds from it signifies the understanding.</p><p>[5] The modest maidens seen in the adjoining apartment, signified affections of truth; and the chaste wife, the conjunction of good and truth. The little children signified the innocence of wisdom therein; they were angels from the third heaven, who all appear like little children. The harlot, together with the dead horse, signified the falsification of the Word by many of this day, whereby all understanding of truth perishes. The harlot signified falsification; and the dead horse, no understanding of truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 26 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>26. (v.) Quod sensus spiritualis Verbi non alicui posthac detur, nisi qui in genuinis veris a Domino est.- Causa haec est, quia nemo potest sensum spiritualem videre, nisi a solo Domino, et nisi in genuinis veris ab Ipso sit; sensus enim spiritualis Verbi agit de solo Domino et de Ipsius regno, et ille sensus est in quo sunt angeli Ipsius in caelo, est enim Divinum Ipsius Verum ibi; hoc homo violare potest, si in scientia correspondentiarum est, et per illam vult sensum spiritualem Verbi ex propria intelligentia explorare; nam ex aliquibus correspondentiis sibi notis potest sensum ejus pervertere, et illum ad confirmandum etiam falsum trahere, et hoc foret violare Divinum Verum, et quoque caelum: quare si quis a se et non a Domino sensum illum aperire vult, clauditur caelum; quo clauso, homo aut nihil videt, aut spiritualiter insanit. Causa etiam est, quia Dominus per Verbum unumquemque docet, et docet ex illis veris quae apud hominem sunt, et non immediate nova infundit; quare nisi homo in Divinis veris sit, aut si modo in paucis veris et simul in falsis, potest ex his falsificare vera; ut quoque fit a quovis haeretico quoad ipsum sensum litterae Verbi, ut notum est. Ne itaque aliquis in sensum spiritualem Verbi intret, aut genuinum verum, quod illius sensus est, pervertat, custodiae a Domino positae sunt, quae in Verbo per "cherubos" intelliguntur. Quod custodiae <sup>1</sup>sint positae, hoc mihi ita repraesentatum est:- <p>Datum est videre magnas crumenas, apparentes sicut sacci, in quibus reconditum fuit argentum (in) multa copia; et quia apertae erant, perceptum est sicut unusquisque posset argentum ibi repositum depromere, immo diripere: sed juxta crumenas illas sedebant bini angeli, qui custodes. Locus, ubi repositae erant, apparebat instar praesaepis in stabulo: in camera proxima visae sunt virgines modestae, cum uxore casta; et prope illam cameram stabant bini infantes, et dictum est quod cum illis non infantiliter sed sapienter ludendum sit: postea apparebat scortum, tum equus jacens mortuus. <p>Quibus visis, instructus sum, quod per illa repraesentatus sit sensus litterae Verbi, in quo sensus spiritualis. Magnae illae crumenae argento plenae significabant cognitiones veri in multa copia. Quod apertae essent, et tamen ab angelis custoditae, significabat quod quisque posset inde cognitiones veri desumere, sed quod caveatur ne aliquis sensum spiritualem, in quo merae veritates sunt, falsificet. Praesaepe in stabulo, in quo jacebant crumenae, significabat instructionem spiritualem pro intellectu; hoc significat praesaepe, quia equus, qui inde edit, (significat) intellectum. Virgines modestae, quae in camera proxima visae sunt, significabant affectiones veri, et uxor casta conjunctionem boni et veri. Infantes significabant innocentiam sapientiae inibi; erant angeli e tertio caelo, qui omnes apparent sicut infantes. Scortum cum equo mortuo, significabat falsificationem Verbi a multis hodie, per quam omnis intellectus veri perit; scortum significabat falsificationem, ac equus mortuus intellectum veri nullum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;custodiae pro "custodia" </p>
