<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》 第47节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>SS47.圣言的外在事物，也就是它的字义，由耶路撒冷圣殿的外在事物来代表。这是因为圣殿和会幕一样，都代表天堂和教会，因而代表圣言。耶路撒冷的圣殿代表主的神性人身，主自己在约翰福音教导了这一点：</p>
<p>你们拆毁这殿，我三日内要再建立起来；耶稣这话是以祂的身体为殿。（约翰福音2:19，21）</p>
<p>当某种东西表示主时，它也表示圣言，因为主就是圣言。由于圣殿的内在事物代表天堂和教会，因而圣言的内在事物，所以圣殿的外在事物代表并表示天堂和教会，因而圣言的外在事物，圣言的外在事物就是它的字义。关于圣殿的外在事物，我们读到：</p>
<p>它们以未凿的整块石头建成，里面是香柏木的；内殿所有的墙上，都刻着基路伯、棕树和绽开的花；地板都贴上金子。（列王纪上6:7，29-30）</p>
<p>这一切事物也表示圣言的外在事物，也就是字义的神圣事物。</p>

<h4 align="center">Sacred Scripture (Dole translation 2014) 47</h4>
<p>47. The outer attributes of the Word, which are its literal meaning, are represented by the decorated surfaces inside the Jerusalem temple.
<p>This is because the Temple in Jerusalem represented the same things as the tabernacle did - heaven and the church, that is, and therefore also the Word.
<p>The Lord himself tells us in John that the Temple in Jerusalem meant his divine human nature:
<p>“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” He was speaking of the temple of his body. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_19.htm">John 2:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_21.htm">21</a>)
<p>And when something means the Lord it also means the Word, because the Lord is the Word. Now, since the inner contents of the Temple represented the inner attributes of heaven and of the church and therefore of the Word as well, so too the decorated surfaces inside the Temple represented and referred to the outer attributes of heaven and of the church and therefore of the Word as well, which are the elements of its literal meaning.
<p>We read of the Temple and its decorated surfaces inside that it was built of whole uncut stones and was paneled on the inside with cedar, and that all its interior walls were carved with angel guardians, palm trees, and open flowers, and its floor was overlaid with gold (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_6_7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_6_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_6_29.htm">29-30</a>), all referring to the outer attributes of the Word, which are the holy features of its literal meaning. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (Rogers translation 2014) 47</h4><p>47. The outer constituents of the Temple in Jerusalem represented the outer constituents of the Word, which are those of its literal sense. That is because the Temple had the same representation as the Tabernacle, namely heaven and the church, and so also the Word.<p>That the Temple in Jerusalem symbolized the Lord’s Divine humanity is something the Lord Himself tells us in John:<p>Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.... But He was speaking of the temple of His body. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_19.htm">John 2:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_21.htm">21</a>)<p>And wherever the Lord is meant, the Word is meant as well, because the Lord embodies the Word.<p>Now because the inner constituents of the Temple represented the inner constituents of heaven and the church, thus also those of the Word, therefore its outer constituents represented and symbolized the outer constituents of heaven and the church, thus also those of the Word, which are those of its literal sense.<p>Regarding the outer constituents of the Temple, we read that they were built of whole, uncut stone, and inside of cedar; that all its walls within were carved with figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; and that the floor was overlaid with gold (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_6_7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_6_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_6_29.htm">29-30</a>). All of these particulars, too, symbolized the outer constituents of the Word, which are the holy ones of its literal sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (Dick translation) 47</h4><p>47. (5) BY THE EXTERNALS OF THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM WERE REPRESENTED THE EXTERNALS OF THE WORD, WHICH BELONG TO ITS SENSE OF THE LETTER. <p>This is because the same was represented by the temple as by the tabernacle, namely, heaven and the Church, and thence also the Word. That the temple at Jerusalem signified the Divine Human of the Lord, He Himself teaches in John: <p>Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up ... But He spake of the temple of His body. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_19.htm">John 2:19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_21.htm">21</a>;<p>and where the Lord is meant, the Word also is meant, because He is the Word. Now, since the interior things of the temple represented the interior things of heaven and the Church, thus also of the Word, therefore its exterior things represented and signified the exterior things of heaven and the Church, thus also the exterior things of the Word, which belong to the sense of the Letter. Concerning the exterior things of the temple it is written:<p>That they were built of stone, whole and unhewn, and of cedar within; and that all its walls within were carved with cherubim, palm trees and open flowers; and that the floor was overlaid with gold. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_6_7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_6_29.htm">29-30</a>. <p>By all these things are also signified the externals of the Word, which are the holy things of the sense of its Letter. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Holy Scripture (Potts translation 1904) 47</h4><p>47. The external things of the Temple at Jerusalem represented external things of the Word, which belong to the sense of its letter. This is because the Temple represented the same as did the Tabernacle, namely, heaven and the church, and consequently the Word. That the Temple at Jerusalem represented the Lord's Divine Human, He Himself teaches in John:<p>Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise it up; He spake of the Temple of His Body (John 2: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_2_21.htm">21</a>).<p>Where the Lord is meant, there also is meant the Word, for the Lord is the Word. Now as the interior things of the Temple represented interior things of heaven and the church (and therefore of the Word), its exterior things represented and signified exterior things of heaven and the church, and therefore exterior things of the Word, which belong to the sense of its letter. Concerning the exterior things of the Temple we read:<p>That they were built of whole stone, not hewn, and within of cedar; and that all its walls within were carved with cherubim, palm trees, and openings of flowers; and that the floor was overlaid with gold (1 Kings 6: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_6_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-kings_6_29.htm">29-30</a>);<p>all of which things also signify external things of the Word, which are holy things of the sense of the letter. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 47 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>47. (v.) Quod per externa Templi Hierosolymitani repraesentata sint externa Verbi, quae sunt sensus litterae ejus, est quia simile per templum, quod per tabernaculum, repraesentatum est, nempe caelum et ecclesia, et inde quoque Verbum. Quod per "Templum Hierosolymitanum" significatum sit Divinum Humanum Domini, docet Ipse apud Johannem, <p>"Solvite Templum hoc, et in tribus diebus exsuscitabo illud Ipse loquebatur de Templo Corporis sui" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_47/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_2_19">2:19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_47/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_2_21">21</a>); <p>Et ubi intelligitur Dominus, etiam intelligitur Verbum, quia Dominus est Verbum. Nunc quia per interiora templi repraesentata sunt interiora caeli et ecclesiae, ita quoque Verbi, ideo per exteriora ejus repraesentata et significata sunt exteriora caeli et ecclesiae, ita quoque Verbi, quae sensus litterae ejus sunt. De exterioribus templi legitur, <p>Quod aedificata sint ex lapide integro non caeso, et ex cedro intus; et quod omnes parietes ejus intus sculpti essent cherubis, palmis et aperturis florum; et solum obductum auro (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_47/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_1-kings_6_7">1 Regnum 6:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_47/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_1-kings_6_29-30">29-30</a>); <p>Per quae omnia etiam significantur externa Verbi, quae sancta sensus litterae ejus sunt. </p>
