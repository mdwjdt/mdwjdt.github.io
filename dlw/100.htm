<h4 align="center"></h4><p>100、从显为太阳的主发出的热与光就是那在一种显著意义上被称为属灵本质的，它们以单数形式被称为属灵本质，因为它们是一。因此，当下文提及属灵本质时，它是指合在一起的这二者。正是由于这种属灵本质，整个灵界才被称为属灵的。灵界的一切事物都通过这种属灵本质而获得自己的起源，以及自己的名称。这热与光之所以被称为属灵本质，是因为神被称为“灵”，作为灵的神就是属灵的发出。神凭自己的本质而被称为耶和华；但凭这发出而活跃并光照天堂天使和教会之人。故经上说，生气和光照是通过耶和华的灵实现的。</p>

100. The warmth and light that emanate from the Lord as the sun are what we call "spiritual;" and they are referred to as spiritual in the singular because they are a single whole. In the following pages, therefore, when it says "spiritual" it will mean both as a single whole. It is because of this spiritual [energy] that the whole other world is called "spiritual." Everything in that world has its source in that spiritual [energy] and takes its name from it as well.<p>The reason the warmth and light are called "spiritual" is that God is called "the Spirit," and God as the Spirit is that emanation. As to his very essence, God is called Jehovah; but he enlightens and gives life to heaven's angels and to us of the church through that emanation. This is why it is said that giving life and bringing about enlightenment are acts performed by the spirit of Jehovah. </p>

100. The heat and light that emanate from the Lord as the sun are by virtue of their preeminence what we call the spiritual essence, and we call them the spiritual essence in the singular because they are one. Consequently in subsequent discussions where we mention the spiritual essence, we mean the two together.<p>It is because of that spiritual essence that that entire world is called spiritual. All the constituents of that world have their origin in consequence of that spiritual essence, and so also their designation.<p>The reason we call that heat and that light the spiritual essence is because God is called spirit, <sup>1</sup>
and God as spirit is that emanating essence. In relation to His own essence God is called Jehovah; but it is by that emanating essence that He animates and enlightens angels in heaven and people in the church. Consequently animation and enlightenment are said to be accomplished by the spirit of Jehovah. <sup>2</sup>

100. The heat and light which proceed from the Lord as a Sun are what are pre-eminently called spiritual; and they are called spiritual in the singular because they are one. Wherefore, when the spiritual is mentioned in what follows, there is understood both of these together. It is from that spiritual that the whole of that world is called spiritual. Through that spiritual, everything of that world derives its origin and hence also its name. That heat and that light are called spiritual because God is called a Spirit, and God as a Spirit is the spiritual going forth. God from His Own Very Essence is called Jehovah; but by means of this Proceeding, He vivifies and enlightens the angels of heaven and the man of the Church. For this reason also vivification and enlightenment are said to be effected by means of Jehovah's Spirit. </p>

100. The heat and light that proceed from the Lord as a sun are what in an eminent sense are called the spiritual, and they are called the spiritual in the singular number, because they are one; when, therefore, the spiritual is mentioned in the following pages, it is meant both these together. From that spiritual it is that the whole of that world is called spiritual. Through that spiritual, all things of that world derive their origin, and also their name. That heat and that light are called the spiritual, because God is called Spirit, and God as Spirit is the spiritual going forth. God, by virtue of His own very Essence, is called Jehovah; but by means of that going forth He Vivifies and enlightens angels of heaven and men of the church. Consequently, vivification and enlightenment are said to be effected by the Spirit of Jehovah. </p>

100. Calor et Lux quae a Domino ut Sole procedunt, sunt quae per eminentiam vocantur Spirituale, et vocantur Spirituale in singulari, quia unum sunt; quare in sequentibus ubi dicitur Spirituale, intelligitur utrumque simul. Ex illo Spirituali est, quod totus ille Mundus dicatur Spiritualis; omnia illius Mundi trahunt per illud Spirituale suam originem, et inde quoque denominationem. Quod ille calor et illa lux dicantur Spirituale, est quia Deus vocatur Spiritus, ac Deus ut Spiritus est id Procedens; Deus ex ipsa sua Essentia vocatur Jehovah; sed per illud Procedens vivificat et illustrat Angelos coeli et homines Ecclesiae: quare etiam vivificatio et illustratio dicitur fieri per Spiritum Jehovae. </p>
