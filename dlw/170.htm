<h4 align="center"></h4><p>170、普遍目的，即创造万物的目的，就是能有一个造物主与受造宇宙的永恒结合；若没有祂的神性能存在于其中如同在自己里面，因而能居住并停留在里面的容器，这种结合是不可能的。为使这些容器能成为祂的居所和住处，他们必须貌似凭自己成为祂的爱与智慧的接受者，因而成为诸如貌似凭自己将自己提升到造物主那里，并使自己与祂结合的那种接受者。没有这种互动能力，结合是不可能的。这些容器就是人类，人类能貌似凭自己提升自己，并使自己结合。前面多次指出，人类就是这样的容器，他们貌似凭自己成为神性的接受者。主通过该结合存在于祂所创造的一切作品中。因为万物受造，最终都是为了人类。因此，一切受造物的功用逐级上升，从最低级的受造形式直到人类，并通过人类上升到造物主神那里，它们皆源于神(如65-68所述)。</p>

170. The grand purpose, or the purpose of all elements of creation, is an eternal union of the Creator with the created universe. This does not happen unless there are subjects in which his divinity can be at home, so to speak, subjects in which it can dwell and abide. For these subjects to be his dwellings and homes they must be receptive of his love and wisdom apparently of their own accord, subjects who will with apparent autonomy raise themselves toward the Creator and unite themselves with him. In the absence of this reciprocity, there is no union.<p>We are those subjects, people who can raise themselves and unite with apparent autonomy. I have already explained several times [<a href="4.htm" target=_top>4-6</a>, <a href="57.htm" target=_top>57</a>, <a href="68.htm" target=_top>68</a>, <a href="116.htm" target=_top>116</a>] that we are subjects of this sort and that we are receptive of Divinity with apparent autonomy.<p>Through this union, the Lord is present in every work he has created, since in the last analysis everything has been created for our sake. As a result, the functions of all created things rise level by level from the lowest things to us, and through us to God the Creator, their source, as explained in <a href="65.htm" target=_top>65-68</a> above. </p>

170. The universal end of creation, or the end in all its constituents, is for an eternal conjunction of the Creator with the created universe to take place, and this is not possible without vessels in which His Divinity can exist as though in itself, thus in which it can dwell and abide. For these vessels to be His dwellings or abodes, they must be recipients of His love and wisdom as though of themselves, thus recipients which will as though of themselves elevate themselves to the Creator and conjoin themselves with Him. Without this reciprocity, conjunction is not possible.<p>These vessels are human beings, who are able as though of themselves to elevate and conjoin themselves. That human beings are such vessels, and that they are recipients of the Divine as though of themselves - this we have demonstrated several times above.<p>By that conjunction the Lord is present in every work created by Him. For everything was created ultimately for the sake of mankind. Consequently the uses of all that He created ascend by degrees from the lowest created forms to mankind, and through mankind to God the Creator from whom they originate, as we showed above in nos. <a href="65.htm">65-68</a>. </p>

170. The universal end, that is, the end of all things of creation, is that there may be an eternal conjunction of the Creator with the created universe, and that is not possible unless there are subjects in which His Divine can be as in itself, thus in which it can dwell and abide. And these subjects, in order that they may be His dwelling-places and mansions, must be recipients of His Love and Wisdom as of themselves, thus such as will elevate themselves as if of themselves towards the Creator, and conjoin themselves with Him. No conjunction is possible without this reciprocity. These subjects are men who are able, as of themselves, to elevate and conjoin themselves. That men are such subjects and that they are recipients of the Divine, as of themselves, has been shown above many times. By means of that conjunction, the Lord is present in every work created by Him; for everything has been created finally for the sake of man. Wherefore the uses of all created things ascend by degrees from ultimates to man, and through man to God the Creator from Whom all things are as was shown above<a href="65.htm">65-68</a>. </p>

170. The universal end, that is, the end of all things of creation, is that there may be an eternal conjunction of the Creator with the created universe; and this is not possible unless there are subjects wherein His Divine can be as in Itself, thus in which it can dwell and abide. In order that these subjects may be dwelling-places and mansions of Him, they must be recipients of His love and wisdom as of themselves; such, therefore, as will elevate themselves to the Creator as of themselves, and conjoin themselves with Him. Without this ability to reciprocate no conjunction is possible. These subjects are men, who are able as of themselves to elevate and conjoin themselves. That men are such subjects, and that they are recipients of the Divine as of themselves, has been pointed out above many times. By means of this conjunction, the Lord is present in every work created by Him; for everything has been created for man as its end; consequently the uses of all created things ascend by degrees from outmosts to man, and through man to God the Creator from whom [are all things] (as was shown above, n. <a href="65.htm" target=_top>65-68</a>). </p>

170. Finis universalis seu omnium creationis est, ut conjunctio aeterna Creatoris sit cum Universo creato, et illa non datur nisi subjecta sint, in quibus Divinum Ipsius potest esse sicut in se, ita in quibus potest habitare et manere; quae subjecta, ut sint habitacula et mansiones Ipsius, erunt recipientia Amoris et Sapientiae Ipsius sicut a se, ita quae <sup>1</sup>
se sicut a se elevatura <sup>2</sup>
sint ad Creatorem, et se conjunctura <sup>3</sup>
cum Ipso; absque hoc reciproco non datur conjunctio. Haec subjecta sunt Homines, qui se sicut a se elevare et conjungere possunt: quod homines talia subjecta sint, et quod recipientes Divini sint sicut a se, supra pluries demonstratum est. Per illam Conjunctionem est Dominus praesens in omni opere ab Ipso creato; nam omne creatum est finaliter propter hominem; quare usus omnium quae creata sunt, ascendunt per gradus ab ultimis ad hominem, et per hominem ad Deum Creatorem a quo, ut supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_170/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_65" target=_top>65-68</a> <sup>4</sup>
