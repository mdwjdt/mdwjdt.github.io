<h4 align="center"></h4><p>177、我们在前面讨论并在《天堂与地狱》一书说明，灵界和自然界一样，也有水和陆地；不同之处在于，这些水和陆地是属灵的。这些因是属灵的，故受灵界太阳的热和光驱使和调节，由这太阳所产生的大气充当媒介，就像自然界的水和陆地受自然界太阳的热和光驱使和调节，其大气充当媒介一样。</p>

<p>
177. I have already presented (and in Heaven and Hell illustrated) the fact that there are bodies of water and there are lands in the spiritual world just as there are in the physical world, with the difference that the bodies of water and lands in the spiritual world are spiritual. Because they are spiritual, they are moved and affected by the warmth and light of the spiritual sun through its atmospheres just as the bodies of water and lands in our physical world are moved and affected by the warmth and light of the sun of our world through its atmospheres. </p>

<p>
177. The fact that the spiritual world has in it bodies of water and also lands like the natural world, with the difference that bodies of water and lands in the spiritual world are spiritual - this we have declared above and shown in the book Heaven and Hell. Moreover, because they are spiritual, they are actuated and modified by the heat and light of the sun by means of the atmospheres arising from it, just as bodies of water and lands in the natural world are actuated and modified by the heat and light of the sun of their world by means of its atmospheres. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #177 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
177. It has been said above and also shown in the work HEAVEN AND HELL, that in the spiritual world there are also waters as well as earths, with the difference that the waters and earths of the spiritual world are spiritual. And because they are spiritual, they are actuated and modified by the heat and light of the spiritual Sun by means of the atmospheres from it, just as waters and earths in the natural world are, by the heat and light of the sun of their world by means of its atmospheres. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #177 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
177. That there are also waters and lands in the spiritual as well as in the natural world, with the difference that these waters and lands are spiritual, has been said above and has been shown in the work Heaven and Hell; and because these are spiritual, they are moved and modified by the heat and light of the spiritual sun, the atmospheres therefrom serving as mediums, just as the waters and lands in the natural world are moved and modified by the heat and light of the sun of their world, its atmospheres serving as mediums. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #177 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
177. Quod in Mundo spirituali etiam Aquae sint, et quoque Terrae sint, sicut in Mundo naturali, cum differentia quod aquae et terrae Mundi spiritualis sint spirituales, supra dictum est, et in Opere de COELO ET INFERNO ostensum; quae quia spirituales sunt, actuantur et modificantur per calorem et lucem Solis spiritualis mediis athmosphaeris inde, prorsus sicut aquae et terrae in Mundo naturali per calorem et lucem Solis sui Mundi mediis athmosphaeris ejus. </p>
