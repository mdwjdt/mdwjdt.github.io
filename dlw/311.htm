<h4 align="center"></h4><p>311、但即便如此，这些努力都是无生命的，因为它们是生命的最低或最外在之力的努力；这些力从它们所源于的生命那里拥有一种通过一切可用的手段回到其源头的奋斗在自己里面。在其最终形式中的大气就变成这种力；诸如出现在地上的那类物质和材料通过这种力被塑造成形式，并从内从外被保持在形式中。这个主题太大了，无法在此展开更多解释。</p>

311. Still, all these tendencies are not alive. They are tendencies of the energies of the ultimate expressions of life, energies that ultimately have within them, because of the life they come from, a striving to return to their origin by the means at hand. In their final forms, the atmospheres are energies of this sort, energies by which the material substances characteristic of earth are prompted to take form and are maintained in forms both inwardly and outwardly. I am not at leisure to explain this in greater detail, since that would be a major undertaking. </p>

311. But even so, these endeavors are all inanimate, for they are endeavors of the lowest forces of life, forces which have present in them from the life from which they originate a striving to return through any available means to their origin.<p>The atmospheres in their last forms become such forces, by which such substances and materials as occur in the earth are actuated into forms and held in forms, both from within and from without.<p>We do not have the space to demonstrate these points further, because to do so would require a large volume. </p>

311. But yet all these conatuses are not living for they are the conatuses of the ultimate forces of life, within which forces there is present, from the life out of which they spring, a striving to return at length to their origin through the means available. Atmospheres become such forces in ultimates by which substances and matters such as are on the earth, are moulded into forms and are held together in forms both within and without. Time does not permit of fuller explanation here owing to the extent of the subject. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #311 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
311. Still none of these are living conatus, for they are the conatus of life's outmost forces; within which forces there exists, from the life out of which they spring, a striving to return at last to their origin through the means afforded. In outmosts, atmospheres become such forces; and by these forces, substances and matters, such as are in the lands, are molded into forms and held together in forms both within and without. But the subject is too large to allow a more extended explanation here. </p>

<p>
311. Sed usque omnes illi conatus non sunt vivi, sunt enim conatus virium ultimarum vitae, quibus viribus ex vita ex qua sunt, tandem inest nisus per media oblata redeundi ad suam originem: athmosphaerae in ultimis fiunt tales vires, a quibus substantiae et materiae, quales in terris sunt, actuantur in formas, et continentur <sup>1</sup>
in formis tam intra quam extra. Haec pluribus demonstrare non vacat, quia ampli operis est. <p>
