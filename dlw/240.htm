<h4 align="center"></h4><p>240、人里面有两种来自主的官能将他与动物区别开来。其中一种官能是理解真理与良善的能力；这种官能被称为理性，是他理解的能力。另一种官能是践行真理与良善的能力；这种能力被称为自由，是他意愿的能力。因为人凭其理性能随心所欲地思考，或与神一致，或与神对立，或与邻舍一致，或与邻舍对立；他还能意愿并行出他所想的；但当预见不幸或害怕惩罚时，他能在自由中停止作恶。<br><br>人之为人，并有别于动物，正是凭这两种官能。人从主拥有这两种官能，并且每时每刻从主那里拥有它们。它们不会被夺走，因为如果它们被夺走，他的人性就会灭亡。主在这两种官能中与每个人同在，无论善人还是恶人。它们是主在人类里面的居所。正因如此，所有人，无论是善是恶，都会活到永远。然而，主在人里面的居所随着人利用这些官能打开自己里面的更高层级而更加靠近。因为通过打开这些层级，人会进入爱和智慧的更高层级，从而更加靠近主。由此可见，随着这些层级被打开，人在主里面，主在人里面。</p>

240. There are two abilities within us, gifts from the Lord, that distinguish us from animals. One ability is that we can discern what is true and what is good. This ability is called "rationality," and is an ability of our discernment. The other ability is that we can do what is true and what is good. This ability is called "freedom," and is an ability of our volition. Because of our rationality, we can think what we want to think, either in favor of God or against God, in favor of our neighbor or against our neighbor. We can also intend and do what we are thinking, or when we see something evil and are afraid of the penalty, can use our freedom to refrain from doing it. It is because of these two abilities that we are human and are distinguished from animals.<p>These two abilities are gifts from the Lord within us. They come from him constantly and are never taken away, for if they were taken away, that would be the end of our humanity. The Lord lives in each of us, in the good and the evil alike, in these two abilities. They are the Lord's dwelling in the human race, which is why everyone, whether good or evil, lives forever. However, the Lord's dwelling within us is more intimate as we use these abilities to open the higher levels. By opening them, we come into consciousness of higher levels of love and wisdom and so come closer to the Lord. It makes sense, then, that as these levels are opened, we are in the Lord and the Lord is in us. </p>

<p>240. A person has in him two faculties from the Lord which distinguish him from animals. One of these faculties is his ability to understand what is true and what is good. This faculty is called rationality, and it is a faculty of his intellect. The other faculty is his ability to do what is true and good. This faculty is called freedom, and it is a faculty of his will. For a person can think in accordance with his rationality whatever he wishes, either in accord with God or in opposition to God, or in accord with the neighbor or in opposition to the neighbor, and he can also will and do what he thinks. Or, when he envisions misfortune or fears punishment, he can in freedom refrain from doing it.<p> </p>
<p>[2] It is because of these two faculties that a person is human and distinguished from animals.<p>A person has these two faculties from the Lord, and he has them continually from the Lord. Nor are they taken away, for if they were taken away, his humanity would perish.<p>The Lord dwells with every person, be he good or evil, in these two faculties. They are the Lord's abode in the human race. It is because of this that everyone, whether good or evil, lives to eternity.<p>However, the Lord's dwelling in a person is nearer as the person uses these faculties to open the higher degrees in him. For by their opening he comes into higher degrees of love and wisdom, thus drawing nearer to the Lord.<p>It can be seen from this that according as these degrees are opened, so the person is in the Lord, and the Lord in him. </p>

<p>240. There are in man from the Lord two faculties by which he is distinguished from beasts. One faculty is the ability to understand what truth is and what good is. This faculty is called rationality, and is a faculty of his understanding. The other faculty is the ability to do what is true and good. This faculty is called freedom, and is a faculty of his will. For man, by his rationality, is able to think whatever he pleases, either with or against God, and either with or against the neighbour. He can also will and do what he thinks. But when he sees evil and fears punishment, he is able, by his freedom, to abstain from doing it. Man is a man by reason of these two faculties, and is distinguished from beasts. Man has these two faculties from the Lord, and has them from Him continually, nor are they taken away, for if they were taken away, man's human would perish. In these two faculties, the Lord is with every man, with the good man as well as the evil. They are the Lord's dwelling-place in the human race. Hence it is that every man, whether good or evil, lives to eternity. But the Lord's dwelling is nearer in man as man by means of these faculties, opens the higher degrees. For by the opening of these, man comes into higher degrees of love and wisdom, thus nearer to the Lord. From these things it can be established that as these degrees are opened, so man is in the Lord, and the Lord in him. </p>

240. There are in man from the Lord two capacities whereby he is distinguished from beasts. One of these is the ability to understand what is true and what is good; this is called rationality, and is a capacity of his understanding. The other is an ability to do what is true and good; this is called freedom, and is a capacity of his will. For man by virtue of his rationality is able to think whatever he pleases, either with or against God, either with or against the neighbor; he is also able to will and to do what he thinks; but when he sees evil and fears punishment, he is able, by virtue of his freedom, to abstain from doing it. By virtue of these two capacities man is man, and is distinguished from beasts. Man has these two capacities from the Lord, and they are from Him every moment; nor are they taken away, for if they were, man's human would perish. In these two capacities the Lord is with every man, good and evil alike; they are the Lord's abode in the human race; from this it is that all men live for ever, both the good and evil. But the Lord's abode in man is nearer as by the agency of these capacities man opens the higher degrees, for by the opening of these man comes into higher degree of love and wisdom, thus nearer to the Lord. From this it can be seen that as these degrees are opened, man is in the Lord and the Lord in him. </p>

<p>240. Sunt binae facultates a Domino apud hominem, per quas homo distinguitur a bestiis[;] una facultas est, quod possit intelligere quid verum est, et quid bonum; haec facultas vocatur Rationalitas, et est facultas ejus Intellectus: altera facultas est quod possit facere verum et bonum[;] haec facultas vocatur Libertas, et est facultas ejus voluntatis; homo enim potest ex rationalitate sua cogitare quicquid lubet, tam cum Deo quam contra Deum, et cum proximo et contra proximum, et quoque potest velle et facere, quae cogitat, sed cum videt malum et timet poenam, potest ex libero desistere a faciendo.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Homo ex binis illis facultatibus est homo, et distinguitur a bestiis. Binae illae facultates sunt homini a Domino, et continue sunt ab Ipso, nec ei auferuntur, nam si auferrentur, periret humanum ejus. In his binis facultatibus est Dominus apud unumquemvis hominem, tam apud bonum quam apud malum; sunt illae mansio Domini in Humano Genere; inde est quod omnis homo tam bonus quam malus vivat in aeternum. At mansio Domini propior apud hominem est, sicut homo mediis illis facultatibus aperit gradus superiores; per aperitionem enim illorum venit in Gradus superiores amoris et sapientiae, sic propius ad Dominum. Ex his constare potest, quod sicut illi Gradus aperiuntur, ita homo in Domino sit, et Dominus in illo. </p>
