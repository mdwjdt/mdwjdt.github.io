<h4 align="center"></h4><p>229、有些人坚持认为，可能有一种物质极其简单，以至于不是一个由更小形式构成的形式，由这种物质通过聚集的过程产生了从属物或复合物，最终产生被称为材料的物质。而事实上，这种绝对简单的物质不可能存在。因为没有形式的物质是什么呢？它是无法以任何事物来表明的某种事物，凡来自无法以任何事物来表明的某种事物之物，都无法通过聚集的过程而得以构成。一切事物的最初受造物质，即最微小和最简单的物质有无数成分在里面；我们将在下文，就是论述形式的地方看到这一事实。</p>

229. Some people say that there is a substance so simple that it is not a form made up of lesser forms, and that by putting enough of this substance together, secondary substances or compounds come into being, eventually leading to the substances that we refer to as "matter." However, there is no such thing as these "simplest substances." What would a substance be without some form? It would be something without attributes, and nothing can be constituted by putting together things that have no attributes.<p>Later, when I discuss forms, we will see that there are countless elements in the very first created substances, the very smallest and simplest ones. </p>

229. Some people maintain that there is a substance so simple as not to be a form composed of lesser forms, and that through conglomerations there arise from that substance secondary or composite substances, and finally the substances called material substances. But in fact such simplest substances do not exist. For what is a substance without form? It is something of which nothing can be predicated, and from something of which nothing can be predicated, nothing can be composed through conglomerations of it.<p>The fact is that the very first created substances, which are the least and simplest substances, have in them constituents beyond number, as we will see in subsequent discussions where we take up forms. </p>

229. It is maintained by some that there can be a substance so simple as not to be a form from lesser forms, and that out of that substance, through accumulations, substantial or composite things come into existence, and at length, substances called material. But there just cannot be such absolutely simple substances. For what is substance without form? It is that of which nothing can be predicated, and out of an entity of which nothing can be predicated, there cannot be anything made up by means of accumulations. That there are innumerable things in the first created substances of all things, which are in least and simplest things, will be seen in what follows where forms are treated of. </p>

<p>
229. Some contend that there can be a substance so simple as not to be a form from lesser forms, and out of that substance, through a process of massing, substantiated or composite things arise, and finally substances called material. But there can be no such absolutely simple substances. For what is substance without form? It is that of which nothing can be predicated; and out of mere being of which nothing can be predicated, no process of massing can make anything. That there are things innumerable in the first created substance of all things, which are things most minute and simple, will be seen in what follows, where forms are treated of. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #229 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
229. Traditur a quibusdam quod substantia tam simplex detur, ut non sit forma a minoribus formis, et quod ex illa substantia per coacervationes existant substantiata seu composita, et tandem substantiae quae materiae vocantur: sed usque tales simplicissimae substantiae non dantur; quid enim est substantia absque forma[;] est tale de quo non aliquid praedicari potest, et ex ente, de quo nihil praedicari potest, non potest aliquid per coacervationes conflari. Quod innumerabilia sint in omnium primis substantiis creatis, quae sunt minima et simplicissima, videbitur in sequentibus, ubi de formis agetur. </p>
