<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第288节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>288、由于神是一位人，所以整个天使天堂总体上类似一个人，并照着人的肢体、内脏和器官被划分为各个地区和区域。因此，有些天堂社群构成脑的一切事物的区域，有些社群构成面部器官的一切事物的区域，还有些社群构成身体内脏的一切事物的区域；这些区域彼此有别，就像人里面的这些器官彼此有别一样。此外，天使知道自己在大人的哪个区域。整个天堂都在这种形像中，因为神是一位人。神也是天堂，因为构成天堂的天使是从主那里接受爱和智慧者，接受者是形像。在《属天的奥秘》的几个章节末尾，我们已经说明，天堂就存在于人的一切事物的形式中。</p>

<p>
288. Since God is a person, the whole angelic heaven, taken as a single unit, presents itself as a single person. It is divided into regions and districts according to our human members, organs, and viscera. There are heavenly communities that make up the district of the brain and all its components, of all the facial parts, and of all our physical internal organs; and these districts are distinguished from each other exactly the way they are in us. In fact, angels know what district of the [heavenly] person they live in.<p>Heaven as a whole has this appearance because God is a person; and God is heaven because the angels who constitute heaven are recipients of love and wisdom from the Lord, and recipients are images.<p>I have explained at the close of a series of chapters in Secrets of Heaven that heaven is in the human form in all respects. </p>

288. Since God is human, therefore the whole angelic heaven in its entirety resembles a single person. It is moreover divided into regions and provinces corresponding to the members, viscera and organs of the human anatomy. For there are societies in heaven which constitute the province of all the components of the brain, societies which constitute the province of all the organs of the face, and societies which constitute the province of all the viscera of the body; and these provinces are differentiated from each other just as the components in the human anatomy are. Angels also know in what province of the human anatomy they are.<p>The whole of heaven is in this image because God is human. God, moreover, is heaven, because the angels who constitute heaven are recipients of love and wisdom from the Lord, and recipients are images.<p>We have already shown at the ends of several chapters in Arcana Coelestia (The Secrets of Heaven) that heaven exists in the form of all the constituents of the human anatomy. </p>

<p>
288. Since God is a Man, therefore the whole angelic heaven in the aggregate has reference to a single man, and is divided into regions and provinces according to the members, viscera and organs of man. For there are societies of heaven which constitute the province of all the things of the brain, of all the things of the facial organs, and of all the things of the viscera of the body. And these provinces are distinguished from each other just as those organs are in man. Moreover the angels know in which province of man they are. The entire heaven has this resemblance because God is a Man. God, too, is heaven because the angels who constitute heaven are recipients of love and wisdom from the Lord, and recipients are images. It has been shown in the ARCANA CAELESTIA, at the end of several chapters, that heaven is in the form of all things of man. </p>

<p>
288. Because God is a Man, the whole angelic heaven in the aggregate resembles a single man, and is divided into regions and provinces according to the members, viscera, and organs of man. Thus there are societies of heaven which constitute the province of all things of the brain, of all things of the facial organs, and of all things of the viscera of the body; and these provinces are distinct from each other, just as those organs are in man; moreover, the angels know in what province of Man they are. The whole heaven is in this image, because God is a Man. God is also heaven, because the angels, who constitute heaven, are recipients of love and wisdom from the Lord, and recipients are images. That heaven is in the form of all things of man is shown in the Arcana Coelestia, at the end of various chapters. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #288 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
288. Quoniam Deus est Homo, ideo universum Coelum angelicum in complexu unum Hominem refert; ac illud in Regiones et Provincias distinctum est secundum Membra, Viscera et Organa hominis; sunt enim Societates <sup>1</sup>
Coeli quae faciunt Provinciam omnium Cerebri, et omnium Organorum faciei, tum omnium Viscerum corporis, ac illae Provinciae inter se distinguuntur prorsus sicut illa apud hominem; sciunt etiam Angeli in qua Provincia Hominis sunt. Universum Coelum in hac effigie est, quia Deus est Homo; ac Deus est Coelum, quia Angeli, qui constituunt Coelum, recipientes amoris et sapientiae a Domino sunt, ac recipientes sunt imagines. Quod Coelum in forma omnium hominis sit, in ARCANIS COELESTIBUS ad finem plurium Capitum ostensum est. <p>
