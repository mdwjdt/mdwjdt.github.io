<h4 align="center"></h4><p>392、心肺的这两种运动之所以发生并持续，是因为整个天使天堂，无论总体还是细节，都拥有这两种生命运动。整个天使天堂都拥有这些运动，因为主从祂所在并来自祂的太阳那里把它们灌注进去。事实上，来自主的太阳产生了这两种运动。此外，由于天堂和世界的一切事物都是从主通过那太阳，以一种就像从头到尾环环相扣的链条那样的联系和形式依次降下来的，还由于爱与智慧的生命来自主，宇宙的所有力量都来自生命，所以显而易见，这些运动的起源不在别处。由此可知，这些运动照着对爱与智慧的接受而发生变化。</p>

392. The reason these two motions (that of the heart and that of the lungs) happen so reliably is that the whole angelic heaven is engaged in these two life motions both overall and in individual instances. The reason the whole angelic heaven is engaged in them is that the Lord is instilling them from the sun where he is and which comes from him. This sun causes these two motions at the Lord's behest. Further, since by design all heaven and earth depend on the Lord through that sun, since they are as intimately connected as a work that is linked together from beginning to end, and since the life of love and wisdom comes from him and all the activities in the universe depend on life, we can see that this is their only source. It follows that their variations depend on the way love and wisdom are accepted. </p>

<p>
392. The reason these two motions, the cardiac and the pulmonary, occur and continue is that the entire angelic heaven, both in general and in particular, possesses these two motions of life. The entire angelic heaven possesses them because the Lord infuses them from the sun where He is and which emanates from Him. For that sun engenders these two motions from the Lord. Moreover, because all the constituents of heaven and the world descend in succession from the Lord through that sun in such a nexus and form, like the links of a chain from the first to the lasts of them, and because the life of love and wisdom originates from Him, and all the forces of the universe spring from life, it is apparent that the origin of these motions lies nowhere else.<p>It follows that the varying of these motions occurs in accordance with the reception of love and wisdom. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #392 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
392. These two motions-cardiac and pulmonary-exist and continue because the whole angelic heaven in general and in particular is in these two motions of life; and this again is because the Lord pours them forth from the Sun where He is, and which is from Him; for that Sun acts from the Lord upon these two motions. It is clear that they have no other origin since all the things of heaven and of the world depend on the Lord through that Sun in such a union of form as may be compared to chain work from the first link to the last, also since the life of love and wisdom is from Him, and all the forces of the universe are from life. It follows that the variation of these motions is in accordance with the reception of love and wisdom. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #392 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
392. These two movements, the cardiac and the pulmonic, derive their origin and persistence from this, that the whole angelic heaven, in general and in particular, is in these two movements of life; and the whole angelic heaven is in these movements because the Lord pours them in from the sun, where He is, and which is from Him; for these two movements are maintained by that sun from the Lord. It is evident that such is their origin since all things of heaven and all things of the world depend on the Lord through that sun in a connection, by virtue of form, like a chain-work from the first to outmosts, also since the life of love and wisdom is from the Lord, and all the forces of the universe are from life. That the variation of these movements is according to the reception of love and wisdom, also follows. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #392 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
392. Quod duo illi motus, cardiacus et pulmonaris, existant et persistant, est quia universum Coelum Angelicum tam in communi quam in particulari in binis illis vitae motibus est; quod universum Coelum Angelicum in illis sit, est quia Dominus e Sole, ubi Ipse est, et qui ab Ipso, infundat illos; nam Sol ille duos illos motus a Domino agit: et quia omnia Coeli et Mundi a Domino per illum Solem in tali nexu et <sup>1</sup>
forma pendent, sicut opus concatenatum a primo ad ultima, et quia amoris et sapientiae vita ab Ipso est, et omnes vires universi a vita sunt, patet quod non aliunde sit origo. Quod variatio illorum sit secundum amoris et sapientiae receptionem, sequitur. <p>
