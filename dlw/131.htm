<h4 align="center"></h4><p>131、天使转向主具有这样的性质：无论他们将身体转向何处，都仰望他们面前显为太阳的主。天使可以转来转去，从而看见周围的各种事物，但显为太阳的主始终出现在他面前。这看似不可思议，却是事实。我还蒙恩得以看见以这种方式显为太阳的主。我现在就看见祂在我面前；数年来，我一直如此看见祂，不管我在世上朝哪个方向转。</p>

131. Angels' turning toward the Lord is like this: no matter which way they turn their bodies, they are looking at the Lord as the sun in front of themselves. Angels can turn this way and that and can thus see the various things that surround them, but still the Lord as the sun seems to be constantly in front of them.<p>This may seem remarkable, but it is the truth. I too have been allowed to see the Lord as the sun like this. I have been seeing him in front of me for a number of years; whatever direction I turned to, I saw him like this. </p>

131. The turning of angels to the Lord is of such a nature that, in whatever direction they turn their body, they behold the Lord as the sun before them. An angel can turn around and around and so see the various sights surrounding him, but still the Lord as the sun appears continually in front of him.<p>This may seem extraordinary, but yet it is the truth. I have been granted as well to see the Lord as the sun in this way. I see Him in front of me now, and have seen Him in the same way for a number of years, no matter in what direction I have turned in the world. </p>

131. The turning of the angels to the Lord is such that, at every turn of their bodies, they look to the Lord as a Sun in front of them. An angel can turn himself round and round and thereby see the various things which surround him, but yet the Lord as a Sun continually appears before his face. This may seem wonderful but still it is the truth. It has also been granted me thus to see the Lord as a Sun. I see Him before my face. And for several years I have so seen Him, to whatever quarter of the world I turned myself. </p>

131. The turning of angels to the Lord is such that at every turn of their bodies they look toward the Lord as a sun in front of them. An angel may turn himself round and round, and thereby see the various things that are about him, still the Lord as a sun appears constantly before his face. This may seem wonderful, yet it is the truth. It has also been granted me to see the Lord thus as a sun. I see Him now before my face; and for several years I have so seen Him, to whatever quarter of the world I have turned. </p>

131. Conversio Angelorum ad Dominum talis est, quod in omni conversione corporis illorum spectent ad Dominum ut Solem ante se: Angelus potest se convertere circum et circum, et per id videre varia quae circum illum sunt, sed usque Dominus ut Sol ante faciem ejus jugiter apparet. Hoc potest mirabile videri, sed usque veritas est; datum etiam est mihi ita Dominum ut Solem videre[;] ante faciem meam video Ipsum, et per plures annos, ad quamcunque plagam Mundi me converteram, Ipsum similiter vidi. </p>
