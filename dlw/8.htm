<h4 align="center"></h4><p>8、由此可见，人无法以纯属世观念来理解神性无处不在，却又不在空间中；但天使和灵人清楚明白这一点；因此，世人只要允许些许属灵之光进入他的思维，也能理解；这是因为进行思考的不是他的身体，而是他的灵，因而不是他的属世心智，而是他的属灵心智。</p>

<p>
8. It stands to reason, then, that with merely earthly concepts we cannot grasp the fact that Divinity is everywhere and still not in space, and that angels and spirits understand this quite clearly. This means that we too could understand if we would only let a little spiritual light into our thinking. The reason we can understand is that it is not our bodies that think but our spirits; so it is not our physical side but our spiritual side. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #8 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
8. It can be seen from this that one cannot from the perspective of a merely natural idea comprehend how the Divine is everywhere and yet does not exist in space, how angels and spirits comprehend this clearly, and how people can do so, too, provided that they admit into their thought some ray of spiritual light. The reason people can comprehend this is owing to the fact that is it not their body which thinks, but their spirit, thus not their natural element, but their spiritual one. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #8 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
8. From these considerations it can be established that man cannot comprehend, from a merely natural idea, that the Divine is everywhere and yet not in space, and that angels and spirits comprehend this clearly; consequently, that a man may also do so provided he admits into his thought something of spiritual light. The reason that a man may comprehend this is that it is not his body that thinks but his spirit, consequently not his natural but his spiritual [mind]. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #8 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
8. From this it may be seen that man is unable, by a merely natural idea, to comprehend that the Divine is everywhere, and yet not in space; but that angels and spirits comprehend this clearly; consequently that a man also may, provided he admits into his thought something of spiritual light; and this for the reason that it is not his body that thinks, but his spirit, thus not his natural, but his spiritual. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #8 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
8. Ex his constare potest, quod homo ex idea mere naturali non comprehendere possit, quod Divinum sit ubivis et tamen non in spatio; et quod angeli et spiritus id clare comprehendant; consequenter quod etiam homo possit, modo in cogitationem suam admittat aliquid lucis spiritualis; causa quod homo possit comprehendere, est quia non corpus ejus cogitat, sed spiritus ejus, ita non naturale ejus, sed spirituale ejus. </p>
