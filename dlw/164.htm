<h4 align="center"></h4><p>164、由于这两个世界如此不同，所以存在两个太阳是有必要的，一切属灵之物来自一个太阳，一切属世之物来自另一个太阳。由于一切属灵之物在其源头上都是活的，一切属世之物因它们的源头都是死的，而这些源头就是太阳，故可推知，一个太阳是活的，另一个太阳是死的；主通过活的太阳创造了死的太阳本身。</p>

164. Since these two worlds are so distinct, then, it is necessary that there be two suns, one the source of everything spiritual and the other the source of everything physical. Further, since everything spiritual is alive in origin and everything physical is dead in origin, and the suns are the origins, it follows that the one sun is alive and the other dead, and that the sun that is actually dead was created by the Lord by means of the sun that is living. </p>

164. Now because these two worlds are so distinct, it is necessary that there be two suns, one from which everything spiritual originates, and the other from which everything natural originates. And because everything spiritual from its origin is alive, and everything natural from its origin is lifeless, and their origins are the suns, it follows that the one sun is alive and that the other sun is lifeless, and that the lifeless sun was itself created by the Lord by means of the alive sun. </p>

<p>
164. Now because those two worlds are so distinct, it is necessary that there should be two suns, one from which all spiritual things are, and the other from which all natural things are. And because all spiritual things in their origin are living, and all natural things from their origin are dead, and the suns are the origins, it follows that the one Sun is living and the other sun is dead; also that the dead sun itself has been created by the Lord by means of the living Sun. </p>

164. Now as these two worlds are so distinct, it is necessary that there should be two suns, one from which all spiritual things are, and another from which all natural things are. And as all spiritual things in their origin are living, and all natural things from their origin are dead, and these origins are suns, it follows that the one sun is living and the other dead; also, that the dead sun itself was created by the Lord through the living sun. </p>

<p>
164. Nunc quia duo illi Mundi ita distincti sunt, necessum est ut bini Soles sint, unus ex quo omnia spiritualia sunt, et alter ex quo omnia naturalia; et quia omnia spiritualia ex <sup>1</sup>
sua origine sunt viva, et omnia naturalia ex sua origine mortua, ac Soles sunt Origines, sequitur quod unus Sol vivus sit, et quod alter Sol mortuus sit, tum quod ipse Sol mortuus per Solem vivum a Domino creatus sit. <p>
