<h4 align="center"></h4><p>262、由于与生俱来的这种反作用，属世心智或属世人当爱自己爱世界高于一切时，就会反对与属灵心智或属灵人有关的事物。这时，他也乐享各种邪恶，如通奸、诡诈、报复、亵渎等等。他还承认大自然为宇宙的创造者，并利用他的理性官能来证实这一切。证实之后，他要么败坏、要么扼杀、要么弃绝天堂和教会的良善和真理，最终要么逃避它们，要么背弃它们，要么憎恨它们。他是在灵里这样做的，并且只要他出于他的灵敢与别人谈论，不害怕丧失名声，由此丧失荣誉和利益，就会在肉体上这样做。当一个人具有这种品性时，他就会逐渐将属灵心智关闭得越来越紧。通过虚假对邪恶的证实尤其会关闭它；因此，邪恶和虚假一经证实，死后就无法被根除；它们只有在世上通过悔改才能被根除。</p>

262. Because of an inborn reflex, the earthly mind or self resists what comes from the spiritual mind or self when that mind loves itself and the world above all else. Then it finds delight in all kinds of evil--in adultery, cheating, vindictiveness, blasphemy, and the like; and it also recognizes only nature as the creatress of the universe. It uses its rational ability to find proofs of all this, and once it has these proofs, it distorts or stifles or diverts whatever of the church and heaven is good and true. Eventually it either escapes such things, or rejects them, or hates them. It does this in spirit, and does it also physically whenever it dares to speak with others from its spirit without fear of losing reputation, for the sake of respectability and profit.<p>When people are like this, then their spiritual mind closes more and more tightly. It is primarily the justifications of evil by falsity that close it, which is why confirmed evil and falsity cannot be rooted out after death. They can be rooted out only in this world, by repentance. </p>

262. Because of the reactive nature inherent in it, the natural mind or self acts in opposition to matters connected with the spiritual mind or self when it loves itself and the world above all else. It also finds delight then in evils of every kind, such as in adulterous affairs, in fraudulent practices, in acts of vengeance, and in blasphemies, and other like things. And it also credits nature then as responsible for the creation of the universe.<p>Moreover, it uses its rational faculty to defend all of these things. And once it has formed its arguments in their defense, it either perverts the goods and truths of heaven and the church, or stifles them, or rejects them, and at last it either runs from them, or turns its back on them, or hates them. This it does in spirit, and only in the flesh to the extent that it dares to speak in accord with its spirit in the company of others without fearing the loss of reputation and the consequent loss of honor or gain.<p>When a person is of such a character, he then causes his spiritual mind to become gradually more and more tightly closed. It is especially his defenses of evil by falsities that close it. This is the reason that confirmed evil and falsity cannot be eradicated after death. They are eradicated only in the world through repentance. </p>

262. The natural mind or man, from the reaction which is in him from birth, acts against the things which are of the spiritual mind or man, when he loves himself and the world above all things. Then also he feels delight in evils of every kind, as in adulteries, frauds, revenges, blasphemies and other like things. And he then also acknowledges nature as creator of the universe, all of which things he confirms by his rational faculty. And after confirmations he either perverts or suffocates, or repels the goods and truths of heaven and the Church, and at length, either shuns them or turns his back upon them or hates them. This he does in his spirit, and in the body just so far as he dares to speak with others from his spirit without fear of the loss of reputation as a means to honour and gain. When man is such, he successively closes up the spiritual mind more and more closely. Confirmations of evil by means of falsities especially close it up. Hence it is that confirmed evil and falsity cannot be extirpated after death. They are extirpated only in the world by means of repentance. </p>

262. By virtue of the reaction which is in him from birth the natural mind, or man, when he loves himself and the world above all things, acts against the things that are of the spiritual mind or man. Then also he has a sense of enjoyment in evils of every kind, as adultery, fraud, revenge, blasphemy, and other like things; he then also acknowledges nature as the creator of the universe; and confirms all things by means of his rational faculty; and after confirmation he either perverts or suffocates or repels the goods and truths of heaven and the church, and at length either shuns them or turns his back upon them or hates them. This he does in his spirit, and in the body just so far as he dares to speak with others from his spirit without fear of the loss of reputation as a means to honor and gain. When man is such, he gradually shuts up the spiritual mind closer and closer. Confirmations of evil by means of falsities especially close it up; therefore evil and falsity when confirmed cannot be uprooted after death; they are only uprooted by means of repentance in the world. </p>

262. Mens seu homo naturalis ex reactione sibi connata agit contra illa quae Mentis seu hominis spiritualis sunt, cum se et mundum super omnia amat; tunc etiam jucundum sentit in malis omnis generis, ut in adulteriis, in defraudationibus, <sup>1</sup>
in vindictis, inque blasphemationibus, et in similibus aliis: et quoque tunc naturam ut creatricem Universi agnoscit: et omnia per rationale suum confirmat; et post confirmationes bona et vera Coeli et Ecclesiae vel pervertit, vel suffocat, vel reflectit, et tandem illa vel fugit, vel aversatur, vel odio habet; hoc in spiritu suo, et tantum in corpore, quantum ex spiritu suo cum aliis absque timore jacturae famae propter honorem et lucrum, audet loqui. Quando homo talis est, tunc Mentem spiritualem successive arctius et arctius occludit; confirmationes mali per falsa imprimis occludunt; inde est quod malum et falsum confirmatum post mortem non exstirpari possit; exstirpatur modo in Mundo per poenitentiam. <p>
