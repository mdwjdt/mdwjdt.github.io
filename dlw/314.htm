<h4 align="center"></h4><p>314、在植物界的功用形式中，创造的形像体现在这一方面：植物从最初发展到最终、又从最终发展到最初。最初是种子，最终是包着皮的茎杆，它们通过作为茎杆终端的皮趋向种子，这种子就是我们所说的最初成分。被皮包裹的茎杆类似被土壤覆盖的大地，由此产生一切功用的创造和形式。许多人都知道，植物的生长是经由外皮、内皮和新生组织，通过一种攀升，藉由根的表皮及其围绕茎、枝的延续物进入果实的初始，并以同样的方式通过果实进入种子而实现的。在这些功用的形式中，创造的形像就表现在功用从最初到最终，又从最终到最初形成的过程中，也表现在这一方面：产出果实和种子的目的，即功用，就在这整个过程里面。由上述内容清楚可知，宇宙创造的过程是从其第一源头，就是被太阳所环绕的主，进行到最终形式，就是大地的物质，又从这些形式通过功用回到其第一源头，或主那里。很明显，整个创造的目的就是功用。</p>

314. We can see how the forms of functions in the plant kingdom offer an image of creation in the way they develop from their beginnings to their limits and from their limits to their beginnings. Their beginnings are seeds, and their limits are their stalks clothed with bark. Through the bark, which is the limit of the stalk, they develop toward seeds, which are their beginnings, as already noted. The stalks clothed with bark echo the planet clothed with soils that give rise to the creation and formation of all its useful functions. There is ample evidence that plant growth takes place through the bark and cortical layers, working through the stalks and branches as extensions of the coverings of the roots into the beginnings of fruits, and in the same way through the fruits into seeds. An image of creation in the forms of functions is offered in the development of their formation from beginnings to limits and from limits to beginnings, as well as in the fact that throughout their development there is the goal of producing fruits and seeds that are useful.<p>We can see from what I have just been saying that the process of creation of the universe goes from its very beginning, the Lord clothed with the sun, to its limit, which is the soil, and from this, through its functions, back to its very beginning, the Lord. We can see also that the goals of the whole creation are useful functions. </p>

314. In forms of use belonging to the plant kingdom, an image of creation is visible in this respect, that they progress from their first constituents to their last, and from their last constituents to their first. Their first constituents are seeds, their last constituents are stems covered with bark, and through the bark, which is the final integument of the stems, they progress to seeds, which, as we said, are their first constituents.<p>The stems covered with bark resemble the earth covered with soil, out of which arises the creation and formation of all useful ends.<p>It is a fact known to many that plant growth occurs through the bark, cambium and other coverings, by struggling up through the integuments of the roots and through their continuations around the stems and branches into the beginnings of fruits, and in like manner through the fruits into seeds.<p>An image of creation in these forms of use is apparent in the progression of their formation from their first constituents to their last, and from their last constituents to their first, and from the fact that present throughout their progression is the goal of producing fruits and seeds, which are useful ends.<p>From the foregoing observations it is apparent that the progression in the creation of the universe went from its first origin, which is the Lord girded with the sun, to last forms, which are the substances of the earth, and from these through useful endeavors to the first origin or the Lord. It is apparent, too, that the ends in the whole of creation were forms of use. </p>

314. In the forms of uses of the vegetable kingdom the image of creation appears in this that from their first things they proceed to their ultimates, and from ultimates to their firsts. Their first things are seeds, their ultimates are stalks clothed with bark, and by means of the bark which is the ultimate of the stalks, they tend to seeds which, as was said, are their first things. The stalks clothed with layers of bark represent the globe clothed with earths out of which come the creation and formation of all uses. Many people are aware that vegetable growths take place by the pushing upwards of sheaths, rinds, and barks by means of the coverings of the roots being continued around the stems and branches to the beginnings of fruits, and so on through fruits to seeds. An image of creation appears in forms of uses in the progress of their formations from firsts to ultimates and from ultimates to firsts; also in the whole progression there is the end of producing fruit and seeds, which are uses. It is clear from the foregoing statement that the progression of the creation of the universe was from its First, which is the Lord encircled by the Sun to ultimates which are earths, and from these through uses to its First, that is, the Lord. Moreover, the ends of the whole creation were uses. </p>

314. In the forms of uses of the vegetable kingdom an image of creation appears in this, that from their firsts they proceed to their outmosts, and from outmosts to firsts. Their firsts are seeds, their outmosts are stalks clothed with bark; and by means of the bark which is the outmost of the stalk, they tend to seeds which, as was said, are their firsts. The stalks clothed with layers of bark represent the globe clothed with lands, out of which come the creation and formation of all uses. That vegetation is effected through the outer and inner barks and coatings, by a climbing up, by means of the coverings of the roots (which are continued around the stalks and branches), into the beginnings of the fruit, and in like manner through the fruits into the seeds, is known to many. An image of creation is displayed in forms of uses in the progress of the formation of uses from firsts to outmosts, and from outmosts to firsts; also in this, that in the whole progression there lies the end of producing fruit and seeds, which are uses. From what has been said above it is plain, that the progression of the creation of the universe was from its First (which is the Lord encircled by the sun) to outmosts which are lands, and from these through uses to its First, that is, the Lord; also that the ends of the whole creation were uses. </p>

314. In formis usuum Regni vegetabilis apparet imago creationis in eo, quod a suis primis procedant ad sua ultima, et ab ultimis ad prima; prima illarum sunt semina, ultima illarum sunt caules investiti libro, et per librum, qui est ultimum caulium, tendunt ad semina, quae ut dictum est, sunt illarum prima. Caules investiti libris referunt tellurem investitam terris, e quibus creatio et formatio omnium usuum existit. Quod per libros, philyras et tunicas fiant vegetationes, enitendo per involucra radicum continuata circum caules et ramos in initiamenta fructuum, et similiter per fructus in semina, multis notum est. Imago creationis in [illis] usuum formis exstat in progressione formationis illorum a primis ad ultima, et ab ultimis ad prima, tum [ex eo] quod in omni progressione sit finis producendi fructus ac semina, quae sunt usus. Ex supradictis patet, quod progressio creationis universi fuerit a suo Primo, qui est Dominus cinctus Sole, ad ultima, quae sunt terrae, et ab his per usus ad suum Primum seu Dominum; tum quod fines totius creationis fuerint usus. </p>
