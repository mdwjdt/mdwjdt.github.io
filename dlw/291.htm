<h4 align="center"></h4><p>291、第二部分还说明了这一点：灵界太阳不是主，而是主的神性之爱和神性智慧的一种发出。之所以称它为一种发出，是因为灵界太阳由本身为物质和形式的神性之爱和神性智慧产生，神性通过这太阳发出。但由于人类理性是这样：它不愿同意某件事，除非看到这事的来龙去脉，从而明白它是怎么回事；如在这个例子中，它要明白，既然灵界太阳不是主，而是来自祂的一种发出，那么它是如何产生的；因此我们要说说这个问题。对此，我与天使有过多次交谈，他们说，他们在自己的属灵之光中清楚地明白它，只是很难把它呈现在一个人的属世之光中，因为这两种光，因而他们思维之间的差别太大了。<br><br>然而，他们说，这种情况好比环绕每位天使，由此使得天使的在场向附近和远处的其他人显明的情感和由此而来的思维之气场。但他们说，环绕的气场不是这个天使本人，而是由他的身体的每一个部分所产生的某种事物，物质像溪流一样不断从中流出，流出来的物质则围绕他。此外，直接包裹身体的物质因不断被其生命运作的两个源泉，即心肺激活，故搅动周围的大气产生类似活动，由此在其他人里面产生好像他在场的感觉。因此，它不是从天使发出并延伸出来的情感和由此而来的思维的独立气场，尽管它被称为气场，因为情感只是天使里面的心智形式的状态。此外，他们还说，每位天使都有这样一种气场环绕他，因为主有一个环绕祂的气场，环绕主的气场同样来自主，该气场就是他们的太阳，也就是灵界太阳。</p>

291. One of the things explained in part 2, then, was this: that sun is not the Lord. Rather, it is an emanation from the Lord's divine love and wisdom. It is called an emanation because that sun is brought forth from the divine love and divine wisdom that in and of themselves are substance and form; and Divinity emanates by means of it.<p>However, our reason by its nature will not consent to anything unless it sees the reason behind it, unless it sees how it has happened. In the present instance, reason needs to grasp how the spiritual world's sun was brought forth, inasmuch as it is not the Lord but an emanation from the Lord, so something must be said about this as well. I have had many conversations with angels about this. They have told me that they grasp it clearly in their spiritual light, but that it is almost impossible for them to present it to us in our earthly light because there is such a difference between the two kinds of light, and therefore between their thoughts and ours.<p>They did say, though, that it is like the aura of feelings and consequent thoughts that surrounds every angel, through which angels' presence is established for people both nearby and at a distance. This surrounding aura is not the actual angel, but it is derived from every part of the angel's body. Coherent substances flow from it like a river, and the emanations envelop them. These substances bordering angels' bodies, substances constantly energized by the two fountains of their life, the heart and the lungs, stir the atmospheres into their activities, and in this way establish a sense of the angel's virtual presence among others. This means that there is not a separate aura of feelings and consequent thoughts that go forth in connected fashion, even though that is what we call it, because the feelings are simply states of the forms of the mind within.<p>The angels went on to say that all angels have this kind of aura around them because the Lord does, and that the aura around the Lord is similarly derived from him. This aura is their sun, or the sun of the spiritual world. </p>

<p>291. Among the points shown in Part Two is this one as well, that the sun of the spiritual world is not the Lord. Rather we showed that it is an emanation of His Divine love and wisdom. We call it an emanation because that sun was produced by Divine love and wisdom, which in themselves are substance and form, and the Divine emanates by means of it.<p>However, because human reason is such that it does not assent to something unless it sees it from its cause, thus unless it perceives how it is possible - in the present instance how the sun of the spiritual world, which is not the Lord but an emanation from Him, was produced - therefore we will say something about this, too.<p>I have had many conversations with angels on this point, and they have said that they perceive it clearly in their spiritual light, but that they can present it only with difficulty to a person in his natural light, there being such a great difference between the one light and the other and consequently between their thoughts.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Nevertheless, they have said that the case is similar to that with the atmosphere of affections and consequent thoughts which encompasses every angel, by which his presence is manifested to others near and far. This encompassing atmosphere is not the angel himself, they have said, but something arising from each and every part of his body, from which substances continually emanate like a stream; and the substances which emanate envelop him. Moreover, being continually activated by the two wellsprings of his life's operation, the heart and the lungs, these substances immediately enveloping his body stir the surrounding atmospheres into like activities, and in consequence of it produce in others a perception as though of his presence. Thus there is not some other atmosphere of affections and consequent thoughts which emanate and extend from him, even though it is so called, because affections are only states of the forms of the mind within.<p>Angels have said furthermore that an angel has such an atmosphere about him because the Lord has one about Him, that the atmosphere about the Lord is in like manner from Him, and that that atmosphere is their sun, or the sun of the spiritual world. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #291 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>291. Among those things which are set forth in Part II, there is also this, that the spiritual Sun is not the Lord, but is a going forth from His Divine Love and Wisdom. It is called a going forth, because that Sun is brought forth out of the Divine Love and Wisdom, which are in themselves substance and form, <p>And through this the Divine goes forth. But because human reason is such that it does not give assent without seeing a thing from its cause, and thus having some perception of how it is, so here, something will also be said about how the Sun of the spiritual world, which is not the Lord, but a going forth from Him, is produced. I have spoken much with angels concerning this matter. They have said that they clearly perceive this in its spiritual light, but that they cannot easily present it to man in his natural light, owing to the difference between the two kinds of light, and the consequent difference of thought. They said, however, that his case is like the sphere of affections and of thoughts therefrom which encompasses each angel, and by which his presence is evident to those near or far. They also said that this encompassing sphere is not the angel himself, but is from each and every thing of his body, wherefrom substances constantly emanate like a stream, and whatever emanates, encompasses him; also that these substances close about his body, constantly activated by the two fountains of the motion of his life, the heart and the lungs, excite the atmospheres into their own activities, and thereby present a perception like that of his presence among others. And thus, they said that it is not a separate sphere of affections and consequent thoughts which goes forth and is continued, although it is so called, because the affections are mere states of the mind's forms in the angel. They said further that there is such a sphere around every angel, because there is one around the Lord; and that the sphere around the Lord is in like manner from Himself, and that that sphere is their sun, that is, the Sun of the spiritual world. </p>

<p>
291. This also, among other things, is shown in Part Second:-that the spiritual sun is not the Lord, but is a Proceeding from His Divine Love and His Divine Wisdom. It is called a proceeding, because the sun was brought forth out of Divine Love and Divine Wisdom which are in themselves substance and form, and it is by means of this that the Divine proceeds. But as human reason is such as to be unwilling to yield assent unless it sees a thing from its cause, and therefore has some perception of how it is, - thus in the present case, how the sun of the spiritual world, which is not the Lord, but a proceeding from Him, was brought forth - something shall be said on this subject. In regard to this matter I have conversed much with the angels. They said that they have a clear perception of it in their own spiritual light, but that they cannot easily present it to man, in his natural light, owing to the difference between the two kinds of light and the consequent difference of thought. The matter, however, may be likened, they said, to the sphere of affections and of thoughts therefrom which encompasses each angel, whereby his presence is made evident to others near and far. But that encompassing sphere, they said, is not the angel himself; it is from each and everything of his body, wherefrom substances are constantly flowing out like a stream, and what flows out surrounds him; also that these substances, contiguous to his body, as they are constantly moved by his life's two fountains of motion, the heart and the lungs, arouse the same activities in the atmospheres, and thereby produce a perception as of his presence with others; therefore that it is not a separate sphere of affections and of thoughts therefrom that goes forth and is continuous from him, although it is so called, since the affections are mere states of the mind's forms in the angel. They said, moreover, that there is such a sphere about every angel, because there is one about the Lord, and that the sphere about the Lord is in like manner from Him, and that that sphere is their sun, that is, the sun of the spiritual world. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #291 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>291. Inter illa quae in Parte Secunda ostensa sunt, etiam est hoc, quod Sol ille non sit Dominus, sed quod sit Procedens ex Divino Amore et ex Divina Sapientia Ipsius, ostensum est. Procedens dicitur, quia Sol ille ex Divino Amore et ex Divina Sapientia, quae in se sunt substantia et forma, productus est, et Divinum per hoc procedit. Sed quia Ratio humana talis est, ut non acquiescat, nisi videat rem a sua causa, ita nisi etiam percipiat quomodo, hic quomodo Sol Mundi spiritualis, qui non est Dominus, sed procedens ab Ipso, productus est, quare de hoc etiam aliquid dicetur: de hac re cum Angelis multa loquutus sum, qui dixerunt, quod hoc percipiant clare in luce sua spirituali, sed quod id aegre sistere possint coram homine in ejus luce naturali, quia tale utriusque lucis et inde cogitationum discrimen est:<p> </p>
<p>[2] dixerunt tamen, quod hoc simile sit cum sphaera affectionum et inde cogitationum, quae unumquemvis angelum ambit, per quam praesentia ejus sistitur vicinis et remotis; et quod sphaera illa ambiens non sit ipse Angelus, sed quod sit ex omnibus et singulis corporis ejus, a quo substantiae continue sicut flumen emanant, et quae emanant illum circumstipant, et quod illae substantiae corpori ejus contiguae per binos fontes motus vitae ejus, cor et pulmonem, continue actuatae, athmosphaeras <sup>1</sup>
in activitates suas excitent, et per id sistant perceptionem sicut praesentiae illius apud alios; et sic quod non sit alia sphaera affectionum et inde cogitationum, tametsi ita vocatur, quae exit et continuatur, quia affectiones sunt meri status formarum mentis in illo. Dixerunt porro, quod talis sphaera circum unumquemvis Angelum sit, quia circum Dominum est, et quod sphaera illa circum Dominum sit similiter ab Ipso, et quod illa sphaera sit Sol illorum, seu Sol Mundi spiritualis. <p>
