<h4 align="center"></h4><p>218、这些上升和下降的层级，也被称为在先层级和随后层级，同样被称为高度层级或离散层级，它们以其能力存在于其最终层级中；这一点可通过前几章所引用的一切例子来证实，这些例子都是经可观察、看得清的现象所确认的。然而，在此我只想通过引用死物和活物的努力、力、动作来证实它们。众所周知，努力凭自己什么也做不了，而是通过对应于它的力行动，由此产生动作；因此，努力是力的全部，并通过力是动作的全部；由于动作是努力的最终层级，所以努力通过动作发挥它的能力。努力、力和动作只照高度层级结合，它们的结合不是连续性的，因为它们是离散或分离的，但通过对应离散或分离。事实上，努力并非力，力也并非动作；不过，力是由努力产生的，因为力是被唤醒的努力，动作则由力产生。所以，能力并非单单存在于努力中，也并非单单存在于力中，而是存在于动作中，动作是它们的产物。这一事实似乎仍值得怀疑，因为它没有通过运用自然界中可观察、看得清的现象来说明。尽管如此，这就是努力、力和动作进入能力的过程。</p>

218. Everything I have already cited from what we can sense and perceive may be used in support of the proposition that the rising and falling levels, the ones we call antecedent and subsequent or vertical and distinct levels, find their power in their final stage. At this point, though, I want to cite only energy, force, and motion in lifeless and living entities.<p>It is common knowledge that energy does not accomplish anything by itself, but only through forces responsive to it, using them to cause motion. This is why energy is the whole essence of force, and through force, the whole essence of motion. Since motion is the final stage of energy, energy exercises its power through motion. The only way energy, force, and motion are united is by vertical levels, a union that is not one of continuity, since the levels are distinct, but of responsiveness. Energy, that is, is not force, and force is not motion. Rather, force is produced by energy, and force is energy being exercised; and motion is produced by force. This means that there is no power in pure energy or pure force, but in the motion that they produce.<p>The truth of this may appear debatable because I have not illustrated it by application to things we can sense and perceive in the physical world. Still, this is the nature of stages that culminate in power. </p>

218. As for the statement that these ascending and descending degrees, which we call also prior and subsequent, or degrees of height and discrete degrees, exist in their power in their last degree, this can be confirmed by all those examples which we presented as confirmations from observable and discernible phenomena in the preceding discussions. Here, however, we wish to confirm it by citing only instances of endeavor, force and motion in inanimate entities and in animate ones.<p>People know that endeavor accomplishes nothing by itself, but only through forces corresponding to it, and that through these it produces motion. People also know that for that reason endeavor is everything in the forces, and through the forces, in the motion; and that because motion is the final degree of endeavor, it is through motion that endeavor exerts its power.<p>Endeavor, force and motion operate in conjunction only in accordance with discrete degrees, which are conjoined not through a continuous connection of them, since they are discrete, but through correspondences. For endeavor is not force, and force is not motion. Rather force is produced by endeavor - force being endeavor awakened - and motion is produced by force. Consequently no power exists in endeavor alone, nor in force alone, but in motion, which is their product.<p>The reality of this appears as yet questionable, because it has not been illustrated by applications to observable and discernible phenomena in nature. Nevertheless, it is still how they progress into a state of power. </p>

218. That these ascending and descending degrees, which are also called prior and posterior, and likewise degrees of height or discrete degrees are in their power in their ultimate, can be confirmed by all those things which have been adduced in the preceding sections as confirmations from things of sense and perception. Here, however. I wish to confirm them only by the conatus, forces and motions in dead and in living subjects. It is known that conatus does nothing from itself but acts through forces corresponding to itself, and through these produces motion; consequently that conatus is the everything in forces, and through forces, the everything in motion; and because motion is the ultimate degree of conatus, through motion conatus exerts its power. Conatus, force and motion are not otherwise conjoined except according to degrees of height, the conjunction of which is not by continuity, for they are discrete, but by correspondences. For conatus is not force, nor is force motion. But force is produced by conatus, because force is conatus In action, and through force motion is produced. Wherefore there is no power in conatus alone, nor in force alone, but there is power in motion which is their product. That such is the case may still appear doubtful because not illustrated by applications to sensible and perceptible things in nature; nevertheless, such is the progression of conatus, force and motion into power. </p>

218. That these ascending and descending degrees, also called prior and subsequent, likewise degrees of height or discrete degrees, are in their power in their outmost degree, may be confirmed by all those things that have been adduced in the preceding chapters as confirmations from objects of sense and perception. Here, however, I choose to confirm them only by the conatus, forces and motions in dead and in living subjects. It is known that conatus does nothing of itself, but acts through forces corresponding to it, thereby producing motion; consequently that conatus is the all in forces, and through forces is the all in motion; and since motion is the outmost degree of conatus, through motion conatus exerts its power. Conatus, force, and motion are no otherwise conjoined than according to degrees of height, conjunction of which is not by continuity, for they are discrete, but by correspondences. For conatus is not force, nor is force motion, but force is produced by conatus, because force is conatus made active, and through force motion is produced; consequently there is no power in conatus alone, nor in force alone, but in motion, which is their product. That this is so may still seem doubtful, because not illustrated by applications to sensible and perceptible things in nature; nevertheless, such is the progression of conatus, force, and motion into power. </p>

218. Quod Gradus illi ascendentes et descendentes, qui etiam vocantur priores et posteriores, tum Gradus altitudinis et discreti, in suo Ultimo sint in sua potentia, confirmari potest <sup>1</sup>
ab omnibus illis, quae in praecedentibus a sensibilibus et perceptibilibus ad confirmationes allata sunt: sed hic solum illa confirmare volo per Conatus, Vires et Motus in subjectis mortuis et in subjectis vivis. Notum est, quod Conatus ex se nihil agat, sed per vires sibi correspondentes, et quod per eas sistat motum; et quod inde sit, quod conatus sit omne in viribus, et per vires in motu; et quia motus est gradus Conatus ultimus, quod per illum agat suam potentiam: conatus, vis et motus non aliter conjuncti sunt quam secundum gradus altitudinis, quorum conjunctio non est per continuum, sunt enim discreti, sed per correspondentias; nam conatus non est vis, nec vis est motus, sed vis producitur a conatu, est enim vis conatus excitatus, et motus producitur per vim; quare non aliqua potentia est in solo conatu, nec in sola vi, sed in motu, qui est productum eorum. Quod ita sit, apparet <sup>2</sup>
adhuc sicut anceps, quia non per applicationes ad sensibilia et perceptibilia in natura illustratum; sed usque talis est progressio illorum in potentiam. <p>
