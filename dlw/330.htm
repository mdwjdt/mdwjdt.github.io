<h4 align="center"></h4><p>330、由于创造的最终目的是一个由人类形成的天使天堂，因而也是人类本身，所以其它一切受造物都是中间目的。而这些因与人有关，是为了人与主的结合，故涉及人里面的这三样事物：他的身体、理性官能和属灵品格。因为一个人若不是属灵的，就无法与主结合；若不是理性的，就不可能是属灵的；若没有一个健康的身体，就不可能是理性的。这三者就像一座房子；身体好比地基，理性官能好比房子的上层建筑，属灵品格则好比房子里的装饰，与主结合好比他住在其中。由此可见，功用，也就是创造的中间目的，在什么样的秩序、层级和方面上与人有关，即：(1)为了维持他的身体，(2)为了完善他的理性官能，(3)为了他从主那里获得属灵品格。</p>

330. Since the goal of creation is a heaven from the human race (and therefore the human race itself), the intermediate goals are everything else that has been created. Because these do relate to us, they focus on these three aspects of us: our bodies, our rational functioning, and, for the sake of our union with the Lord, our spiritual functioning. We cannot be united to the Lord unless we are spiritual; we cannot be spiritual unless we are rational; and we cannot be rational unless we are physically whole. These aspects are like a house, with the body as its foundation, the structure of the house as our rational functioning, and the contents of the house as our spiritual functioning. Living in the house is union with the Lord.<p>This enables us to see the sequence, level, and focus of the relationship to us of the useful functions that are intermediate goals of creation. That is, they are for the support of our bodies, for the development of our rational ability, and for our acceptance of what is spiritual from the Lord. </p>

330. Since the final end in creation is an angelic heaven from the human race, and so also the human race, therefore its intermediate ends are all other phenomena that have been created. And because these have relation to mankind, they have regard to these three constituents of a person, namely, his body, his rational faculty, and his spiritual character, for the sake of his conjunction with the Lord. For a person cannot be conjoined with the Lord unless he is spiritual, and he cannot be spiritual without being rational, and he cannot be rational without having a body in sound condition. These three are like a house. The body is like the foundation. The person's rational faculty is like the superstructure of the house. His spiritual character is like the furnishings in the house. And conjunction with the Lord is like his inhabiting of it.<p>Apparent from this is the order, degree and respect in which forms of use, the intermediate ends of creation, have relation to mankind, namely, that they are for sustaining a person's body, for perfecting his rational faculty, and for his receiving a spiritual character from the Lord. </p>

330. Since the end of creation is an angelic heaven out of the human race, thus the human race itself, therefore all other created things are mediate ends, which because they have relation to man, look to these three things of his, his body, his rational, and for the sake of conjunction with the Lord, his spiritual. For man cannot be conjoined to the Lord unless he is spiritual, nor can he be spiritual unless he is rational, neither can he be rational unless his body is in a sound state. These three are like a house. The body is like the foundation, the rational is as the house built upon it, the spiritual like those things which are in the house, and conjunction with the Lord like dwelling in it. Hence it is clear in what order, degree and respect uses, which are the mediate ends of creation, have relation to man, namely, for sustaining his body, for perfecting his rational, and for receiving what is spiritual from the Lord. </p>

330. Inasmuch as the end of creation is an angelic heaven out of the human race, and thus the human race itself, all other created things are mediate ends, and these, as having relation to man, with a view to his conjunction with the Lord, refer themselves to these three things in him, his body, his rational, and his spiritual. For man cannot be conjoined to the Lord unless he be spiritual, nor can he be spiritual unless he be rational, nor can he be rational unless his body is in a sound state. These three are like a house; the body like the foundation, the rational like the superstructure, the spiritual like those things which are in the house, and conjunction with the Lord like dwelling in it. From this can be seen in what order, degree, and respect uses (which are the mediate ends of creation) have relation to man, namely, (1) for sustaining his body, (2) for perfecting his rational, (3) for receiving what is spiritual from the Lord. </p>

330. Quoniam finis creationis est Coelum Angelicum ex Humano Genere, ita Humanum Genus, ideo fines medii sunt omnia reliqua quae creata sunt; quae quia se referunt ad Hominem, spectant haec Tria ejus, ejus Corpus, ejus Rationale, et ejus Spirituale[,] propter conjunctionem cum Domino: Homo enim non potest conjungi Domino, nisi spiritualis sit; nec potest spiritualis esse nisi rationalis sit, nec potest rationalis esse nisi corpus in statu integro sit; sunt haec sicut Domus; Corpus est sicut fundamentum, Rationale est sicut domus superinstructa, Spirituale sicut illa quae in domo sunt, et conjunctio cum Domino est sicut habitatio. Inde patet quo ordine, gradu et respectu Usus, qui sunt fines medii Creationis, se referunt ad hominem, quod nempe ad sustentandum Corpus ejus, ad perficiendum Rationale ejus, et ad recipiendum Spirituale a Domino. </p>
