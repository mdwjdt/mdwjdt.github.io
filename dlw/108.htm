<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">2.6 在灵界，太阳和天使之间的距离只是一种表象，它取决于天使对神性之爱和神性智慧的接受</h4><p>108、在恶人和简单人当中盛行的一切谬论都源于被确认的表象。只要表象依旧是表象，它们就是表面真理，人人都可照着表面真理思考和谈论。但是，当它们被当作实际真理接受时，如人们确认它们时的情形，表面真理就会变成虚假和谬误。例如：太阳每天围绕地球转动，并且年复一年的沿黄道行进，这就是一个表象。只要该表象不被确认，它就是一个表面真理，谁都可以据此思考和谈论；事实上，他可以说太阳升起、落下，由此产生早、午、晚、夜；也可以说太阳当前在黄道或其高度的某个点或角度上，由此产生春、夏、秋、冬。但是，当这表象被确认为实际真理时，确认者就会出于谬误思考并谈论虚假。其它无数表象也一样，无论是属世、社会和道德事务方面的，还是属灵事务方面的。</p>

108. The distance between the sun and angels in the spiritual world is an apparent distance that depends on their acceptance of divine love and wisdom. All the illusions that are prevalent among evil people and simple people come from appearances that have been taken as facts. As long as appearances remain appearances, they are virtual truths, and it is all right for anyone to think and talk in terms of them. However, when they are taken to be actual truths, which happens when they are defended as facts, then the virtual truths become falsities and fallacies.<p>For example, it seems as though the sun travels around the earth every day and also follows its yearly ecliptic path. As long as this is not taken as fact, this is a virtual truth, and anyone may think and talk in such terms. We can say that the sun rises and sets, causing morning, noon, evening, and night. We can say that the sun is at this or that point on the ecliptic, or at this or that elevation, causing spring, summer, autumn, and winter. However, when these appearances are defended as the real truth, then the person who defends them is thinking and speaking falsity based on illusion.<p>The same holds true for countless other appearances, not only in earthly, civic, and moral matters, but also in spiritual ones. </p>

108. The distance between the sun and angels in the spiritual world is an appearance in accordance with their reception of Divine love and wisdom. All misconceptions that prevail in evil people and in the simple originate from affirming appearances.<p>As long as appearances remain appearances, they are apparent truths, and everyone may think and speak in terms of them. But when they are accepted as actual truths, which happens when people affirm them, then apparent truths become falsities and misconceptions.<p>For example, it is an appearance that the sun travels daily about the earth and proceeds annually in a path along the ecliptic. As long as this is not affirmed, it is an apparent truth, and everyone may think and speak in terms of it. For one may say that the sun rises and sets, and so produces in succession morning, midday, evening and night. Or one may say that the sun is now in such and such a degree of the ecliptic or of its altitude and now in that, and so produces in succession spring, summer, fall and winter. But when one affirms this appearance as being the actual truth, then out of his misconception the affirmer thinks and speaks falsity.<p>So it is with countless other appearances, not only in natural, civil and moral matters, but also in spiritual ones. </p>

108. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE SUN AND THE ANGELS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD IS AN APPEARANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RECEPTION BY THEM OF THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM <p>All the fallacies that hold sway with the evil and the simple arise from appearances confirmed. So long as appearances remain appearances, they are apparent truths according to which everyone can think and speak. But when they are accepted for the truths themselves, as happens when they are confirmed, then apparent truths become falsities and fallacies. For example, it is an appearance that the sun moves around the earth daily, and once a year follows the apparent path of the sun round the earth. So long as this is not confirmed, it is an apparent truth according to which everyone can think and speak. For he can say that the sun rises and sets, and thereby causes morning, mid-day, evening and night, also that the sun is now in such and such a degree of the ecliptic path or of its altitude, thereby causing spring, summer, autumn and winter. But when that appearance is confirmed as the truth itself, then he who confirms it thinks and speaks a falsity springing from a fallacy. It is the same with innumerable other appearances, not only in natural, civil and moral things but also in spiritual things. </p>

108. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE SUN AND THE ANGELS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD IS AN APPEARANCE ACCORDING TO RECEPTION BY THEM OF DIVINE LOVE AND DIVINE WISDOM. <p>All fallacies which prevail with the evil and the simple arise from appearances which have been confirmed. So long as appearances remain appearances, they are apparent truths, according to which every one may think and speak; but when they are accepted as real truths, which is done when they are confirmed, then apparent truths become falsities and fallacies. For example: It is an appearance that the sun is borne around the earth daily, and follows yearly the path of the ecliptic. So long as this appearance is not confirmed it is an apparent truth, according to which any one may think and speak; for he may say that the sun rises and sets and thereby causes morning, midday, evening, and night; also that the sun is now in such or such a degree of the ecliptic or of its altitude, and thereby causes spring, summer, autumn, and winter. But when this appearance is confirmed as the real truth, then the confirmer thinks and utters a falsity springing from a fallacy. It is the same with innumerable other appearances, not only in natural, civil, and moral, but also in spiritual affairs. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #108 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
108. QUOD DISTANTIA INTER SOLEM ET INTER ANGELOS IN MUNDO SPIRITUALI SIT APPARENTIA SECUNDUM RECEPTIONEM DIVINI AMORIS ET DIVINAE SAPIENTIAE AB ILLIS. Omnes fallaciae, quae apud malos et apud simplices regnant, oriuntur ex apparentiis confirmatis: quamdiu apparentiae manent apparentiae, sunt illae veritates apparentes, <sup>1</sup>
secundum quas unusquisque potest cogitare et loqui; at dum acceptantur pro ipsis veritatibus, quod fit dum confirmantur, tunc apparentes veritates fiunt falsitates et fallaciae. Sicut pro exemplo; apparentia est, quod Sol quotidie circum tellurem feratur, et quotannis secundum Ecclipticam progrediatur; hoc quamdiu non confirmatur, est veritas apparens, secundum quam quisque potest cogitare et loqui; dicere enim potest, quod Sol oriatur et occidat, et per id faciat mane, meridiem, vesperam et noctem; tum quod Sol nunc sit in illis aut in illis gradibus Ecclipticae seu suae altitudinis, et quod per id faciat ver, aestatem, autumnum et hyemem; at dum confirmatur quod illa apparentia sit ipsa veritas, tunc confirmator cogitat et loquitur ex fallacia falsitatem. Simile est cum innumeris aliis apparentiis, non modo in naturalibus, civilibus et moralibus, sed etiam in spiritualibus. <p>
