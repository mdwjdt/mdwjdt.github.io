<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第42节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>42、爱与智慧也一样，唯一不同的是：构成爱与智慧的物质与形式不像外在感官那样为肉眼所见。尽管如此，没有人能否认，那些被称为思维、感知和情感的智慧和爱的事物，都是物质和形式，而不是凭空飞出的实体，或从作为主体的实实在在的物质与形式中抽象出来的。因为头脑里面有无数物质与形式，属于理解力与意愿的一切内在感觉都居于其中。那里的情感、感知与思维并非从它们呼出，而是实实在在的主体；这些主体本身不发出任何东西，只是照着影响它们的外部环境刺激而经受各种变化。这一点从前面关于外在感觉的阐述可以看出来。至于影响它们的外部环境刺激，我们将在下文予以详述。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #42 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
42. It is the same with love and wisdom, the only difference being that the substances and forms that are love and wisdom are not visible to our eyes as are the organs of our external senses. Still, no one can deny that those matters of love and wisdom that we call thoughts, perceptions, and feelings are substances and forms. They are not things that go floating out from nothing, remote from any functional and real substance and form that are their subjects. There are in fact countless substances and forms in the brain that serve as the homes of all the inner sensation that involves our discernment and volition.<p>What has just been said about our external senses points to the conclusion that all our feelings, perceptions, and thoughts in those substances and forms are not something they breathe out; they themselves are functional and substantial subjects. They do not emit anything, but simply undergo changes in response to the things that touch and affect them. There will be more later [<a href="210.htm" target=_top>210</a>, <a href="273.htm" target=_top>273</a>] on these things that touch and affect them. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #42 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
42. The case is the same with love and wisdom, the only difference being that the substances and forms which constitute love and wisdom are not visible to the eyes as the organs of the external senses are. But still, no one can deny that substances and forms constitute those elements of wisdom and love that are called thoughts, perceptions and affections, and that these are not aerial entities flying about or flowing out of nothing, or things abstracted from real and actual substance and form which are the subjects of which they are predicated. For the brain has in it countless substances and forms which are the seat of every interior sense connected with the intellect and will.<p>All affections, perceptions and thoughts in those substances and forms are not exhalations from them, but are actually and really subjects which emit nothing from them, but simply undergo changes of state in accordance with the incoming stimuli that affect them, as may be seen from the observations above regarding the outward senses. (Regarding the incoming stimuli that affect them, more will be said below.) </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #42 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
42. It is the same with love and wisdom, with the difference only that the substances and forms which are love and wisdom are not obvious to the eyes as are the organs of the external senses. Nevertheless, no-one can deny that those things of wisdom and love which are called thoughts, perceptions and affections are substances and forms, and not entities flying and flowing out of nothing, or abstracted from real and actual substance and form which are subjects. For in the brain are innumerable substances and forms in which resides every interior sense which pertains to the understanding and the will. All the affections, perceptions and thoughts there are not exhalations from those, but are actually and really subjects, emitting nothing from themselves, but merely undergoing changes according to whatever flows towards, and affects them. This can be established from the things stated above concerning the external senses. More will be said below about the things flowing towards, and affecting them. </p>

42. It is the same with love and wisdom, with this difference only, that the substances and forms which are love and wisdom are not obvious to the eyes as the organs of the external senses are. Nevertheless, no one can deny that those things of wisdom and love, which are called thoughts, perceptions, and affections, are substances and forms, and not entities flying and flowing out of nothing, or abstracted from real and actual substance and form, which are subjects. For in the brain are substances and forms innumerable, in which every interior sense which pertains to the understanding and will has its seat. The affections, perceptions, and thoughts there are not exhalations from these substances, but are all actually and really subjects emitting nothing from themselves, but merely undergoing changes according to whatever flows against and affects them. This may be seen from what has been said above about the external senses. Of what thus flows against and affects more will be said below. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #42 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
42. Simile est cum Amore et Sapientia, cum sola differentia, quod substantiae et formae, quae sunt amor et sapientia, non exstent coram oculis, sicut organa sensuum externorum; sed usque nemo negare potest, quin substantiae et formae sint illa sapientiae et amoris, quae vocantur cogitationes, perceptiones et affectiones, et quod non sint entia volatilia et fluentia ex nihilo, aut abstracta a reali et actuali substantia et forma, quae subjecta: sunt enim in Cerebro innumerabiles substantiae et formae, in quibus omnis interior sensus, qui se refert ad intellectum et voluntatem, residet. Quod omnes affectiones, perceptiones et cogitationes ibi non sint halitus ex illis, sed quod sint actualiter et realiter subjecta, quae nihil a se emittunt, sed modo mutationes subeunt secundum alluentia quae afficiunt, ex supradictis de sensibus externis constare potest. De alluentibus quae afficiunt, dicentur plura infra. </p>
