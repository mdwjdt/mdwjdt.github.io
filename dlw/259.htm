<h4 align="center"></h4><p>259、前面说明，每个人生来都有这种能力，即理性；但这指的是凡外在没有因某种意外，或因要么在子宫里，要么出生后的某种疾病，或因头部受伤，或由于某种爆发出来并冲破束缚的疯狂之爱而受到损害的人。在这些情况下，理性无法被提升；因为属于意愿和理解力的生命在这类人里面没有它能终止于其中的末端容器，就是被如此布置以致它能照秩序产生最外在行为的容器；事实上，生命是照着最外在的末端，而不是由于它们而行动的。婴孩和儿童不可能有理性，这一点可见于下文(266e节)。</p>

<p>
259. I have stated that everyone is born with this ability, or with rationality, but this means everyone whose outward organs have not been damaged by any external events in the womb, or after birth by illness or some head injury, or by the outburst of a senseless love that lowers all restraints. The rational ability cannot be raised up for people like this. The life of their volition and discernment has no boundaries in which it finds definition, that is, boundaries so arranged that the life can accomplish outward deeds coherently. It does act in keeping with outermost boundaries, but not because of them. On the unavailability of rationality in childhood and early youth, see the close of <a href="266.htm" target=_top>266</a> below. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #259 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
259. We said that every person is born into this faculty, or into rationality, but we mean every person in whom the external elements have not been injured by incidental conditions, whether in the womb, or after birth as a result of disease, or owing to the infliction of a head wound, or to some insane love bursting forth and loosening restraints. Rationality in these cases cannot be elevated. For the life which belongs to the will and intellect does not have in such people terminal vessels in which to rest, vessels so disposed that it can perform orderly outward acts. For life operates in accordance with outmost terminations, though not as a result of them.<p>On the impossibility of rationality in little children and preadolescents, see below at the end of no. <a href="266.htm">266</a>. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #259 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
259. It has been said that every man is born into that capacity, that is, into rationality, but by this is understood every man whose externals have not been damaged by accident, either in the womb, or after birth by disease, or by a wound inflicted on the head, or in consequence of an insane love bursting forth and breaking down restraints. In such the rational cannot be raised, for life which is of the will and the understanding has in these no bounds in which it can terminate, so disposed as to produce outmost acts according to order, for life acts according to outmost determinations, but not from them. That there can be no rationality in infants and children may be seen below (<a href="266.htm">266</a>, at the end). </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #259 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
259. It has been said that every man is born into that capacity, namely, rationality, but by this is meant every man whose externals have not been injured by some accident, either in the womb, or by some disease after birth, or by a wound inflicted on the head, or in consequence of some insane love bursting forth, and breaking down restraints. In such the rational cannot be elevated; for life, which is of the will and understanding, has in such no bounds in which it can terminate, so disposed that it can produce outmost acts according to order; for life acts in accordance with outmost determinations, though not from them. That there can be no rationality with infants and children, may be seen below (n. <a href="266.htm" target=_top>266</a>, at the end). </p>

<p>
259. Dictum est quod omnis homo nascatur in facultatem illam, seu in rationalitatem, sed intelligitur omnis homo, apud quem externa per aliqua contingentia, vel in utero, vel post nativitatem ex morbo, vel ex inflicto capiti vulnere, vel ex Vesano amore erumpente et relaxante repagula, non laesa sunt; apud hos rationale non potest elevari; vita enim, quae est voluntatis et intellectus, apud hos non habet terminos, in quos desinat, ita dispositos, ut secundum ordinem possit ultimos actus agere, agit enim secundum determinationes ultimas, sed non ex illis: quod nec dari possit apud infantes et pueros, videatur infra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_259/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_266" target=_top>266</a> fin. <sup>1</sup>
