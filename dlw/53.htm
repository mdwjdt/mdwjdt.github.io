<h4 align="center"></h4><p>53、存在与显现、物质与形式、甚至生命乃至爱和智慧可用来论及受造和有限之物；但这些都是受造和有限的。这一切之所以能用来论及受造和有限之物，不是因为它们拥有任何神性之物，而是因为它们在神性里面，神性在它们里面。事实上，每一个受造物本身都是无生命的、是死的；但一切事物却因神性在它们里面、它们在神性里面而具有生气，活了过来。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #53 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
53. Created, finite things may be said to have reality and manifestation, substance and form, life, and even love and wisdom, but all of these are created and finite. The reason we can say they have these attributes is not that they possess any divinity but that they are in Divinity and there is Divinity in them. Anything that has been created is intrinsically without soul and dead, but it is given a soul and brought to life by the presence of Divinity in it, and by its dwelling in Divinity. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #53 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
53. Things created and finite can have ascribed to them being and expression, substance and form, and even life, indeed love and wisdom, but these attributes are all created and finite. They can have these attributes ascribed to them not because they possess anything Divine, but because they are in the Divine and have the Divine in them. For everything that has been created is in itself inanimate and lifeless, but is animated and given life by its having the Divine in it and its being in the Divine. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #53 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
53. Esse and Existere can be predicated of things created and finite, likewise substance and form, also life and even love and wisdom, but these are all created and finite. This can be said of things created and finite, not because they possess anything Divine, but because they are in the Divine and the Divine is in them. For everything created is, in itself, inanimate and dead, but is animated and made alive by the fact that the Divine is in it and that it is in the Divine. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #53 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
53. Of things created and finite Esse [Being] and Existere [Taking Form] can be predicated, likewise substance and form, also life, and even love and wisdom; but these are all created and finite. This can be said of things created and finite, not because they possess anything Divine, but because they are in the Divine, and the Divine is in them. For everything that has been created is, in itself, inanimate and dead, but all things are animated and made alive by this, that the Divine is in them, and that they are in the Divine. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #53 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
53. De creatis et finitis potest dici esse et existere, tum substantia et forma, ut et vita, imo amor et sapientia, sed omnia illa sunt creata et finita; causa, quod dici queant, non est quod aliquid Divinum illis sit, sed quod in Divino sint et quod Divinum in illis sit: omne enim quod creatum est, in se est inanimatum et mortuum, sed animatur et vivificatur per id quod Divinum sit in illo, <sup>1</sup>
et illud <sup>2</sup>
in Divino. <p>
