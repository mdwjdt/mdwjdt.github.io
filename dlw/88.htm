<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第88节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>88、由于灵界与自然界之间存在这种不同(如前所示，83节)，所以由自然界太阳所产生的任何事物，也就是它的热与光，以及地上的任何物体，无一能跨越进入灵界。在灵界，自然界的光就是黑暗，自然界的热就是死亡。然而，尘世之热能被天堂之热的流注激活，尘世之光能被天堂之光的流注照亮。流注通过对应关系实现，通过连续性则不能实现。</p>

88. Since there is the kind of distinction described in <a href="83.htm" target=_top>83</a> between what is spiritual and what is physical, not a trace of anything from the sun of the physical world can cross over into the spiritual world--that is, not a trace of its light and warmth or of any object on earth. The light of the physical world is darkness there, and its warmth is death there. Still, our world's warmth can be brought to life by an inflow of heaven's warmth, and our world's light can be brightened by an inflow of heaven's light. This inflow happens by means of correspondences, and cannot happen as a result of continuity. </p>

<p>
88. Since there is such a difference between something spiritual and something natural, as shown above in no. <a href="83.htm">83</a>, therefore not one whit of anything arising from the sun in the natural world can pass over into the spiritual world - not one whit of its light and heat, or one whit of anything existing on the earth. The light of the natural world is darkness there, and its heat is death there. But still the heat of the world can be animated by an influx of the warmth of heaven, and the light of the world can be illumined by an influx of the light of heaven. Influx takes place through correspondent relationships, and cannot take place through a continuum. </p>

<p>
88. Since there is such distinction between the spiritual and the natural as has been shown above (<a href="83.htm">83</a>), therefore not a whit from the sun of the natural world can cross over into the spiritual world, that is, not a whit of its light and heat, or of any object on the earth. The light of the natural world is thick darkness there, and its heat is death there. But yet, the heat of the world can be vivified by an influx of the heat of heaven <sup>1</sup>
, and the light of the world can be illumined by an influx of the light of heaven. Influx takes place by means of correspondences and cannot take place by continuity.<p>

<p>
88. With such a difference between the spiritual and the natural (as shown above, n. <a href="83.htm" target=_top>83</a>), nothing from the sun of the natural world, that is, nothing of its heat and light, nor anything pertaining to any earthly object, can pass over into the spiritual world. To the spiritual world the light of the natural world is thick darkness, and its heat is death. Nevertheless, the heat of the world can be vivified by the influx of heavenly heat, and the light of the world can be illumined by the influx of heavenly light. Influx is effected by correspondences; and it cannot be effected by continuity. </p>

<p>
88. Quoniam tale discrimen est inter Spirituale et Naturale, ut supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_88/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_83" target=_top>83</a> ostensum est, ideo ne hilum ex Sole mundi naturalis transire potest in Mundum spiritualem, hoc est, ne hilum lucis et caloris ejus, aut objecti alicujus in tellure; lux mundi naturalis est caligo ibi, et calor ejus est mors ibi; sed usque calor mundi potest vivificari per influxum caloris coeli, et lux mundi illustrari potest per influxum lucis coeli; influxus fit per correspondentias, et non potest fieri per continuum. </p>
