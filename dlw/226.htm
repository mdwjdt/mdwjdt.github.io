<h4 align="center"></h4><p>226、由于最大和最小的受造物都是由这两种层级构成的形式，故它们之间从初至末皆存在一种联系；因为其相似性将它们联结起来。尽管如此，没有哪两样最小事物是一样的。因此，它们的一切具体和最基本的成分都彼此不同。没有哪两样任一形式或不同形式的最小事物是一样的，因为最大形式里面也有这些层级，并且最大的受造物是由最小的受造物构成的。由于最大的受造物也有这些层级在里面，并且永恒的区别照着这些层级，从最高到最低，或从中心到边缘而存在，故可推知，有这些层级在里面的更小或最小成分，也没有哪两种是一样的。</p>

226. The fact that the largest and smallest things are forms made up of levels of both kinds results in their being connected from beginning to end; their likeness actually unites them. Still, there is not the least thing that is identical to something else, which is why there is a distinctiveness of everything, down to the least detail.<p>The reason there are no identical elements in any form or between different forms is that there are the same kinds of levels in the largest entities, and the largest entities are made up of the smallest ones. When the largest entities are made up of these levels, with corresponding constant distinctions from top to bottom and from center to circumference, it follows that there is nothing in them involving these levels, nothing lesser or least, that is identical. </p>

226. Because the greatest and least of created things are forms composed of degrees of both kinds, a connection exists between them from the firsts to the lasts of them, for their likeness unites them. At the same time, however, not the least thing is the same as another. Consequently the particular and most elemental constituents of them are distinct from each other.<p>The reason not the least thing in any form or in several forms is the same as another arises from the fact the same degrees exist in the greatest of created things, and the greatest of created things consist of the leasts of them. Since the greatest of created things have in them these same degrees, and perpetual distinctions exist in consequence of them from the highest to the lowest of them, or from the center to the peripheries, it follows that there are no lesser or least constituents of them which, having in them the same degrees, are the same. </p>

<p>
226. From the fact that greatest and least things are forms of both kinds of degrees, there is connection between them from firsts to lasts, for likeness conjoins them. But yet there can be no least thing which is the same as any other. Consequently, there is a distinction of all the singulars and of the veriest singulars. There can be no least thing in any form or among any forms the same as another for the reason that there are like degrees in greatest things, and greatest things consist of least things. When there are such degrees in greatest things, and in accordance with those degrees, perpetual distinctions from top to bottom, and from centre to circumference, it follows that there cannot be any lesser or least of these, in which are like degrees, which are the same as any other. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #226 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
226. On account of things greatest and least being forms of both kinds of degrees, there is connection between them from first to last; for likeness conjoins them. Still, there can be no least thing which is the same as any other; consequently all particulars are distinct from each other, likewise all veriest particulars. In any form or in different forms there can be no least thing the same as any other, for the reason that in greatest forms there are like degrees, and the greatest are made up of leasts. From there being such degrees in things greatest, and perpetual differences in accordance with these degrees, from top to bottom and from center to circumference, it follows that their lesser or least constituents, in which there are like degrees, can no one of them be the same as any other. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #226 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
226. Ex eo quod maxima et minima sint formae utriusque generis graduum, est connexio eorum a primis ad ultima, similitudo enim illa conjungit. Sed usque non datur aliquod minimum quod idem est cum altero; per id est omnium singularium et singularissimorum distinctio. Quod non aliquod minimum in aliqua forma, aut inter aliquas formas, quod est idem, detur, est quia in maximis sunt similes gradus, et maxima ex minimis consistunt; quando tales gradus in maximis sunt, et secundum illos perpetua discrimina a summo ad imum, et a centro ad peripherias, sequitur quod non dentur aliqua minora et minima illorum, in quibus similes gradus sunt, quae idem sunt. </p>
