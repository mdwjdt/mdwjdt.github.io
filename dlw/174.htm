<h4 align="center"></h4><p>174、关于被称为以太和空气的大气，它们在这两个世界，即灵界和自然界都差不多；唯一不同的是，它们在灵界是属灵的，在自然界是属世的。前者之所以属灵，是因为它们由灵界太阳产生，而灵界太阳是主的神性之爱和神性智慧的首先发出；它们从主接受系爱的神性之火和系智慧的神性之光在自己里面，并将这二者带到天使所住的天堂，使灵界太阳存在于那里的最大和最小事物中。属灵大气是分离的实质，也就是由灵界太阳所产生的最基本形式。由于这些大气各自单独接受灵界太阳，所以这太阳的火被分散在众多实质，也就是众多形式当中，可以说被它们包裹起来，并被这些包裹物所缓和，从而变成热，最终适合天堂天使和天堂之下的灵人之爱。这太阳的光同样如此。在这方面，属世大气和属灵大气很相似，也是独立的物质，或由自然界的太阳所产生的最基本形式；这些大气也各自单独接受太阳，将它的火储存在自己里面，并缓和之，然后以热的形式将其带到世人所住的大地。它的光也一样。</p>

174. As for the atmospheres that we refer to as "ethers" and "airs," there are similar forms in each world, the spiritual and the physical, the difference being that in the spiritual world they are spiritual, while in the physical world they are physical. They are spiritual because they come from a sun that is the first emanation of the Lord's divine love and wisdom and accept into themselves the divine fire from him that is love and the divine light from him that is wisdom, bringing each down to the heavens where angels live. They bring about the presence of that sun in everything there, from the largest things to the smallest.<p>The spiritual atmospheres are distinct substances or elemental forms that arise from the sun. Since they accept the sun individually, the sun's fire becomes a warmth that is ultimately adapted to the love of angels in heaven and spirits under heaven by being separated into a corresponding number of substances, enfolded in them, and tempered by being enfolded. The same holds true for the sun's light.<p>In this respect, our physical atmospheres are like the spiritual ones. They too are distinct substances and elemental forms, arising from the physical world's sun. They too accept the sun individually and conceal its fire within themselves, temper it, and bring it down as warmth to earth where we are; and the same holds true for light. </p>

174. As regards the atmospheres, which are called ethers and airs, these in the two worlds, the spiritual and the natural, are alike, with the difference that those in the spiritual world are spiritual, while those in the natural world are natural.<p>They are spiritual in the spiritual world because they arise from a sun which is the first emanation of the Lord's Divine love and wisdom, and they receive into them from Him the Divine fire which is love and the Divine light which is wisdom and convey both down to the heavens where angels dwell. They also bring about the presence of that sun in the greatest and least of things there.<p>Spiritual atmospheres are the discrete substances or most elemental forms arising from the sun. Moreover, because they each receive the sun singly and separately, therefore the sun's fire - being apportioned among so many substances or forms and enveloped, so to speak, by them, and by the envelopments tempered - becomes heat, a heat finally suited to the love of angels in heaven and to that of spirits beneath heaven. It is the same with the sun's light.<p>Natural atmospheres in this respect are like the spiritual atmospheres. They, too, are discrete substances or elemental forms arising from the sun of the natural world, which likewise receive the sun singly and separately, storing its fire in them and tempering it, and conveying it down to the earth where people dwell. And doing the same with its light. </p>

174. As regards the atmospheres which are called ethers and airs, they are alike in both worlds, the spiritual and the natural, with the difference that those in the spiritual world are spiritual, and those in the natural world are natural. The former are spiritual because they come into existence from the Sun which is the first proceeding of the Lord's Divine Love and Wisdom, and from Him receive in them the Divine fire which is love, and the Divine light which is wisdom, carrying both down to the heavens where the angels are; and they cause the presence there of that Sun in things greatest and least. The spiritual atmospheres are discrete substances, or least forms, originating from the Sun. And because they receive the Sun singly therefore the Sun's fire, divided into so many substances and forms, and being as it were enveloped by them, and tempered by the envelopings, becomes heat adapted finally to the love of angels in heaven and of spirits under heaven. Similarly with the light of the Sun. In this the natural atmospheres are like the spiritual atmospheres, that they are also discrete substances and least forms, originating from the sun of the natural world. And these also receive the sun singly and store up its fire in themselves, and temper it, carrying it down as heat to the earth where men are. The same is true of the light. </p>

174. As regards the atmospheres, which are called ethers and airs, they are alike in both worlds, the spiritual and the natural, with the difference only that they are spiritual in the spiritual world, and natural in the natural world. The former are spiritual, because they have their form from the sun which is the first proceeding of the Divine Love and Divine Wisdom of the Lord, and from Him receive within them the Divine fire which is love, and the Divine light which is wisdom, and carry these down to the heavens where the angels dwell, and cause the presence of that sun there in things greatest and least. The spiritual atmospheres are divided substances, that is, least forms, originating from the sun. As these each singly receive the sun, its fire, distributed among so many substances, that is, so many forms, and as it were enveloped by them, and tempered by these envelopments, becomes heat, adapted finally to the love of angels in heaven and of spirits under heaven. The same is true of the light of that sun. In this the natural atmospheres are like spiritual atmospheres, that they also are divided substances or least forms originating from the sun of the natural world; these also each singly receive the sun and store up its fire in themselves, and temper it, and carry it down as heat to the earth, where men dwell. The same is true of natural light. </p>

174. Quod Athmosphaeras, quae Aetheres et Aeres vocantur, attinet, sunt illae in utroque Mundo, Spirituali et Naturali, similes, cum differentia, quod illae in Mundo spirituali sint spirituales, et illae in Mundo naturali sint naturales: [in Mundo spirituali] spirituales sunt, quia a Sole, qui est primum procedens Divini Amoris et Divinae Sapientiae Domini, existunt, et ab Ipso recipiunt in se Divinum ignem qui est Amor, et Divinam lucem quae est Sapientia, et utrumque deferunt ad Coelos ubi sunt Angeli; et faciunt praesentiam Solis illius in maximis et in minimis ibi. Athmosphaerae spirituales sunt substantiae discretae, seu minimae formae, oriundae a Sole; et quia singillatim recipiunt Solem, inde ignis Solis in tot substantias seu formas divisus, et ab illis quasi involutus, ac per involutiones temperatus, fit Calor, adaequatus tandem amori Angelorum in Coelo, ac spirituum sub coelo; similiter lux Solis. Athmosphaerae naturales in eo sunt similes Athmosphaeris spiritualibus, quod etiam sint substantiae discretae et minimae formae, oriundae a Sole Mundi naturalis, quae quoque singillatim recipiunt Solem, et ignem ejus in se recondunt, ac illum temperant, ac ut calorem deferunt ad tellurem ubi sunt homines; et similiter lucem. </p>
