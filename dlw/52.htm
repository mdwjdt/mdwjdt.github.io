<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">1.13 宇宙万物是由神-人的神性之爱与神性智慧创造的</h4><p>52、宇宙万物，从最大到最小，从首先到末后，都如此充满神性之爱与神性智慧，以至于可以说，宇宙就是神性之爱与神性智慧的形像。这一事实从宇宙的一切事物与人的一切事物的对应关系很清楚地看出来。存在于受造宇宙中的每一个事物与人的每一个事物都具有这样一种对应关系，以至于可以说，人也是一种宇宙；其情感和由此产生的思维与动物界的一切存在一种对应关系；其意愿和由此产生的理解力与植物界的一切存在一种对应关系；其生命的最外层则与矿物界的一切存在一种对应关系。<br><br>这种对应关系的存在对自然界中的任何人来说并不明显，但对灵界中凡留意这一点的人来说，却是显而易见的。灵界也有存在于自然界的三个王国中的一切事物，它们是灵界居民的情感和思维的对应显现，就是从意愿发出的情感和从理解力发出的思维，以及其生命最外层的对应；这一切事物在他们周围都是可见的，呈现出类似受造宇宙的一种表象；不同之处在于，受造宇宙在次一点的形式中。<br><br>天使由此清楚看出，受造宇宙就是代表神-人的一个形像，祂的爱与智慧以一种形像呈现在宇宙中。并不是说受造宇宙就是神-人，而是说它来自神-人。因为在受造宇宙中，没有任何事物是物质与形式本身，或生命本身，或爱与智慧本身；甚至一个人本身也不是人，一切都来自神；神才是人，智慧与爱，以及形式与物质本身。拥有存在本身者是非受造和无限的；而凡来自这绝对存在者因不含存在本身之物，故是受造和有限的；它反映出祂的形像，从祂存在并显现。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #52 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
52. Everything in the universe was created by the divine love and wisdom of the Divine-Human One. The universe, from beginning to end and from first to last, is so full of divine love and wisdom that you could call it divine love and wisdom in an image. This is clearly evidenced by the way everything in the universe answers to something in us. Every single thing that comes to light in the created universe has such an equivalence with every single thing in us that you could call us a kind of universe as well. There is a correspondence of our affective side and its consequent thought with everything in the animal kingdom, a correspondence of our volitional side and its consequent discernment with everything in the plant kingdom, and a correspondence of our outermost life with everything in the mineral kingdom.<p>This kind of correspondence is not apparent to anyone in our physical world, but it is apparent to observant people in the spiritual world. We find in this latter world all the things that occur in the three kingdoms of our physical world, and they reflect the feelings and thoughts of the people who are there--the feelings that come from their volition and the thoughts that come from their discernment--as well as the outermost aspects of their life. Both their feelings and their thoughts are visible around them looking much like the things we see in the created universe, though we see them in less perfect representations.<p>From this it is obvious to angels that the created universe is an image depicting the Divine-Human One and that it is his love and wisdom that are presented, in image, in the universe. It is not that the created universe is the Divine-Human One: rather, it comes from him; for nothing whatever in the universe is intrinsic substance and form or intrinsic life or intrinsic love and wisdom. We are not "intrinsic persons." It all comes from God, who is the intrinsic person, the intrinsic wisdom and love, and the intrinsic form and substance. Whatever has intrinsic existence is uncreated and infinite; while what comes from it, possessing nothing within itself that has intrinsic existence, is created and finite. This latter presents an image of the One from whom it derives its existence and manifestation. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #52 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>52. Everything in the universe has been created by the Divine love and wisdom of the human God. The universe in its greatest and least elements and in its first and last elements is so full of Divine love and wisdom that it can be said to be Divine love and wisdom in an image. The reality of this clearly appears from the correspondence that all the constituents of the universe have with all the constituents of a human being. Each and every phenomenon that occurs in the created universe has such a correspondence with each and every constituent of the human being that one may declare the human being to be also a kind of universe. His affections and resulting thoughts have a correspondence with all the constituents of the animal kingdom, his will and consequent understanding with all the constituents of the plant kingdom, and the outmost constituents of his life with all the constituents of the mineral kingdom.<p> </p>
<p>[2] The existence of such a correspondence is not apparent to anyone in the natural world, but it is to everyone who takes note of it in the spiritual world. That world contains all the phenomena that occur in the three kingdoms of the natural world, and they are correspondent manifestations of the affections and thoughts of the inhabitants there - of the affections emanating from the will and of the thoughts emanating from the intellect - and of the outmost constituents of their life. Moreover, these correspondent manifestations and phenomena appear round about them in a visible form like that of the created universe, with the difference that they do so in a lesser image of it.<p> </p>
<p>[3] It is clearly apparent to angels from this that the created universe is a representative image of the human God, and that it is His love and wisdom which are displayed in an image in the universe. Not that the created universe is the human God, but that it exists from Him. For nothing whatever in the created universe is substance and form in itself, or life in itself, or love and wisdom in itself, indeed neither is the human being human in himself, but all is from God, who is human in Himself, wisdom and love in itself, and form and substance in itself. Whatever exists in itself is uncreated and infinite. Whatever exists from that, however - this, because it retains nothing in it that exists in itself, is created and finite, and it reflects an image of Him from whom it exists and takes form. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #52 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>52. ALL THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE HAVE BEEN CREATED BY THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM OF GOD-MAN <p>The universe in greatest and least things, and in first and last things is so filled with Divine Love and Wisdom that it may be said to be Divine Love and Wisdom in an image. That this is so is clearly evident from the correspondence of all things of the universe with all things of man. Each and every thing which exists in the created universe has such a correspondence with each and every thing of man, that it may be said that man also is a kind of universe. There is a correspondence of his affections and hence of his thoughts with all things of the animal kingdom; of his will and hence of his understanding with all things of the vegetable kingdom; and of his ultimate life with all things of the mineral kingdom. <p>It is not apparent to anyone in the natural world that there is such a correspondence; but it is apparent to everyone who gives heed to it in the spiritual world. In that world there are all the things which exist in the three kingdoms in the natural world, and they are correspondences of affections and thoughts, of affections derived from the will and of thoughts derived from the understanding, as well as of the ultimate things of the life of those who are there; and both the former and the latter appear around them in such an aspect as in the created universe, with the difference that it is a lesser effigy. From these things it is manifestly clear to the angels that the created universe is an image representative of God-Man, and that it is His Love and Wisdom which are presented in an image in the universe. Not that the created universe is God-Man, but that it is from Him. For nothing whatever in the created universe is substance and form in itself, nor love and wisdom in itself, indeed neither is man a man in himself, but all is from God, Who is Man, Wisdom and Love, and Form and Substance in Himself. That which is in itself is uncreate and infinite. But whatever is from itself, because it has within it nothing of Being-in-itself, is created and finite, and this represents an image of Him from Whom it is and from Whom it exists. </p>

<p>
52. ALL THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE WERE CREATED FROM THE DIVINE LOVE AND THE DIVINE WISDOM OF GOD-MAN. <p>So full of Divine Love and Divine Wisdom is the universe in greatest and least, and in first and last things, that it may be said to be Divine Love and Divine Wisdom in an image. That this is so is clearly evident from the correspondence of all things of the universe with all things of man. There is such correspondence of each and every thing that takes form in the created universe with each and every thing of man, that man may be said to be a sort of universe. There is a correspondence of his affections, and thence of his thoughts, with all things of the animal kingdom; of his will, and thence of his understanding, with all things of the vegetable kingdom; and of his outmost life with all things of the mineral kingdom. That there is such a correspondence is not apparent to any one in the natural world, but it is apparent to every one who gives heed to it in the spiritual world. In that world there are all things that take form in the natural world in its three kingdoms, and they are correspondences of affections and thoughts, that is, of affections from the will and of thoughts from the understanding, also of the outmost things of the life, of those who are in that world, around whom all these things are Visible, presenting an appearance like that of the created universe, with the difference that it is in lesser form. From this it is very evident to angels, that the created universe is an image representative of God-Man, and that it is His Love and Wisdom which are presented, in an image, in the universe. Not that the created universe is God-Man, but that it is from Him; for nothing whatever in the created universe is substance and form in itself, or life in itself, or love and wisdom in itself, yea, neither is man a man in himself, but all is from God, who is Man, Wisdom and Love, also Form and Substance, in itself. That which has Being-in-itself is uncreate and infinite; but whatever is from Very Being, since it contains in it nothing of Being-in-itself, is created and finite, and this exhibits an image of Him from whom it has being and has form. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #52 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>52. QUOD OMNIA IN UNIVERSO A DIVINO AMORE ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA DEI HOMINIS CREATA SINT. Universum in maximis et minimis, ac in primis et ultimis, ita plenum est Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia, ut dici queat quod sit Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia in imagine: quod ita sit, manifeste constat ex correspondentia omnium Universi cum omnibus Hominis: omnia et singula quae in Universo creato existunt, talem correspondentiam cum omnibus et singulis hominis habent, ut dici possit, quod homo etiam sit aliquod universum; correspondentia ejus affectionum et inde cogitationum est cum omnibus Regni animalis, ejus voluntatis et inde intellectus cum omnibus Regni vegetabilis, ac ejus vitae Ultimae cum omnibus Regni mineralis.
<p> </p>
<p>[2] Quod talis correspondentia sit, non apparet alicui in Mundo naturali, sed cuivis, qui attendit, in Mundo spirituali; in hoc Mundo sunt omnia, quae in Mundo naturali in tribus ejus Regnis existunt, et sunt correspondentiae affectionum et cogitationum, affectionum ex voluntate et cogitationum ex intellectu, tum ultimorum vitae, illorum qui ibi; atque haec et illa apparent circum illos in tali aspectu, in quali est Universum creatum, cum differentia, quod in minore effigie.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Ex his manifeste patet angelis, quod Universum creatum sit Imago repraesentativa Dei Hominis, et quod Ipsius Amor et Sapientia sint quae in Universo sistuntur in imagine: non quod Universum creatum sit Deus Homo, sed quod sit ab Ipso; nam nihil quicquam in Universo creato est substantia et forma in se, nec vita in se, nec amor et sapientia in se, imo nec homo est homo in se, sed omne est a Deo, Qui est Homo, Sapientia et Amor, ac Forma et Substantia in se; quod in se est, hoc Increatum et Infinitum est; quod autem ab Ipso est, hoc, quia nihil tenet apud se quod in se est, creatum et finitum est, et hoc repraesentat imaginem Ipsius, a Quo est et existit. </p>
