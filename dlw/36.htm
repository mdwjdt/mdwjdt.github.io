<h4 align="center"></h4><p>36、每个神性作为里面都有爱与智慧的结合；这种结合是它得以持续，并持续到永恒的原因。如果创造之工里面的神性之爱多于神性智慧，或神性智慧多于神性之爱，那么只有其中等量的部分会继续存在，多出的部分则会消失。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #36 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
36. There is a union of love and wisdom in every divine work as well. This is why it endures, even to eternity. If there were more divine love than divine wisdom or more divine wisdom than divine love in any created work, nothing would endure in it except what was equal. Any excess would pass away. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #36 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
36. A union of love and wisdom exists also in every Divine work. That union is the reason for its continuance, indeed, for its continuance to eternity. If any created work should have in it more Divine love than Divine wisdom, or more Divine wisdom than Divine love, only so much of it would continue as had equal measures of these in it. Any remainder would pass away. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #36 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
36. There is also a union of love and wisdom in every Divine work, from which it has its perpetuity and indeed its eternity. If there were more of Divine Love than of Divine Wisdom, or more of Divine Wisdom than of Divine Love in any created work, it would not continue in existence except in the measure in which they were equal. Whatever is in excess passes off. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #36 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
36. There is also a union of love and wisdom in every Divine work; from which it has perpetuity, yea, its everlasting duration. If there were more of Divine Love than of Divine Wisdom, or more of Divine Wisdom than of Divine Love, in any created work, it could have continued existence only in the measure in which the two were equally in it, anything in excess passing off. </p>


<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #36 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
36. Unio Amoris et Sapientiae est quoque in omni Opere Divino; ex illa est perpetuitas, imo aeternitas ejus. Si plus Divini Amoris quam Divinae Sapientiae, aut si plus Divinae Sapientiae quam Divini Amoris, in aliquo opere creato foret, non subsisteret, <sup>1</sup>
nisi quantum ex aequo insunt; transiret <sup>2</sup>
quod super est. <p>
