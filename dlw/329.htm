<h4 align="center"></h4><p>329、宇宙创造的最终目的清楚表明何为功用。宇宙创造的最终目的是一个天使天堂的存在；由于天使天堂就是最终目的，故人或人类也是目的，因为天堂是由人类形成的。由此可推知，一切受造物都是中间目的，就它们与人有关，并通过人与它们所源于的主有关的秩序、层级和方面而言，它们就是功用。</p>

329. We can tell what a useful function is from the goal of the creation of the universe. The goal of the creation of the universe is to bring about an angelic heaven; and since an angelic heaven is the goal, so is humanity or the human race, since that is where heaven comes from. It follows, then, that everything that has been created is an intermediate goal, and that the functions are useful in the sequence, on the level, and in the specific way that they relate to humanity, and through humanity to the Lord. </p>

329. From the final end in creation it can be seen what a form of use is. The final end in creation is the existence of an angelic heaven. And because the angelic heaven is the final end, so, too, is mankind or the human race, since heaven is formed from it. It follows from this that all other phenomena created are intermediate ends, and that these are forms of use in the order, degree and respect that they have relation to mankind and through mankind to the Lord. </p>

329. It can be established what use is from the end of the creation of the universe. The end of the creation of the universe is the existence of an angelic heaven. And because an angelic heaven is the end, man also or the human race is the end since heaven is from that. Hence it follows that all created things are mediate ends, and that there are uses in that order, degree and respect in which they have relation to man, and through man to the Lord. </p>

<p>
329. The end of the creation of the universe clearly shows what use is. The end of the creation of the universe is the existence of an angelic heaven; and as the angelic heaven is the end, man also or the human race is the end, since heaven is from that. From which it follows that all created things are mediate ends, and that these are uses in that order, degree, and respect in which they have relation to man, and through man to the Lord. </p>

<p>
329. Ex fine Creationis Universi constare potest quid usus; finis creationis universi est ut Coelum Angelicum existat; et quia Coelum Angelicum est finis, est quoque Homo seu Genus Humanum, quoniam ex hoc est Coelum; inde sequitur, quod omnia quae creata sunt, sint fines medii, et quod hi in eo ordine, gradu et respectu usus sint, quo se referunt ad hominem, et per hominem ad Dominum. </p>
