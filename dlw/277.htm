<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">3.19 属于属世心智的三个层级的一切都包含在通过身体动作所完成的行为中</h4><p>277、这一部分所阐述的层级的知识能使我们揭开以下奥秘：心智，也就是人的意愿和理解力的一切，都存在于他的动作或行为中，被包含在其中，几乎就像可见和不可见的成分在种子、果实或蛋中一样。动作或行为本身看上去如同它们外表上所显现的那样；然而，它们的内在里面却有无数成分；如整个身体的运动纤维的合力，以及激发并支配这些力的一切心智成分，都具有三个层级，如前所示。由于心智的一切都存在于动作或行为中，所以构成第一个层级的意愿的一切，也就是人的一切爱之情感；构成第二个层级的理解力的一切，也就是来自他的感知的一切思维；以及构成第三个层级的记忆的一切，也就是取自记忆、最接近于言语的一切思维观念，也存在于动作或行为中。当这些东西都被导入一个行动过程时，它们就会产生行为，尽管表面上看，在先成分是不可见的，然而它们确实存在于其中。最外或最低层级是在先层级的复合物、容器和基础(可参看209-216节)；高度层级以其完全和能力存在于其最终层级中(217-221节)。</p>

277. Everything in the three levels of the earthly mind is enclosed in the works that are done by our physical actions. The information about levels conveyed in this part may serve to disclose this hidden principle, namely that everything proper to our minds, to our volition and discernment, is enclosed in our actions or deeds, much like the things we can and cannot see in a seed, a piece of fruit, or an egg. The actions or deeds themselves may seem to be nothing but what shows on the surface, but there are countless elements within them. There are the energies of the motor fibers of the whole body that are cooperating; and there are all those actions of the mind that are rousing and directing those energies, actions on three levels, as already explained [<a href="200.htm" target=_top>200-201</a>]. Further, since all the actions of the mind are involved, so are all the actions of volition, all the desires of our love, that make up the first level. So are all the actions of our discernment, all the thoughts that shape our perception, which make up the second level. All the contents of our memory, all the images of our thinking that are closest to our speech, are also drawn from this source; they constitute the third level. It is from these, focused into actions, that our deeds arise, deeds in whose outward form the antecedents that actually dwell within are not visible.<p>On the final level as the composite, vessel, and foundation of the prior ones, see <a href="209.htm" target=_top>209-216</a> above, and on the vertical levels finding their full realization in their final form, see <a href="217.htm" target=_top>217-221</a>. </p>

277. All the qualities belonging to the three degrees of the natural mind are contained in the works done through actions of the body. A knowledge of degrees, which we have presented in this part of the work, enables us to reveal this secret, that all the qualities of a person's mind or his will and intellect are present in his actions or works, being contained in them almost as the visible and invisible constituents are in a seed, fruit or egg. The actions or works themselves do not appear other than as they do in their outward forms, but still they have present in them countless elements in their inward constituents. For they have present in them the forces of the whole body's motor fibers acting in concert, and all the components of the mind which prompt and direct those forces - components which we have previously shown to be of three degrees.<p>Consequently, because actions or works have present in them all the components of the mind, they have present in them all the components of the will, or all the affections of the person's love, which constitute the first degree. They have present in them all the components of the intellect, or all the thoughts of the person's perception, which form the second degree. And they have present in them all the components of the memory, or all the ideas of the person's thought drawn from the memory and most immediately present in his speech, which provide the third degree.<p>When these are channeled into a course of action, they produce works, and although the prior elements are not apparent in the works seen in their external form, still they are actually present in them.<p>It may be see above in nos. <a href="209.htm">209-216</a> that the last degree embraces, contains, and is the foundation of the prior degrees; and in nos. <a href="217.htm">217-221</a>, that degrees of height exist in their fullness and power in their last degree. </p>

277. ALL THINGS WHICH ARE OF THE THREE DEGREES OF THE NATURAL MIND, ARE INCLUDED IN THE DEEDS WHICH ARE DONE BY THE ACTS OF THE BODY <p>By a knowledge of degrees which is set out in this Part, the following arcanum is disclosed, that all things of the mind, that is of man's will and understanding, are in his acts and deeds, included much in the same way as are things visible and invisible in a seed, or in fruit, or in an egg. Acts or deeds by themselves appear in external things just as these do, but yet in internal things there are innumerable things. For there are the concurring forces of the motor fibres of the whole body, and all the things of the mind which excite and determine these forces, which, as shown above, are of three degrees. And because there are all the things of the mind [in these], there are all the things of the will, that is, all the affections of man's love which make the first degree; and there are all the things of the understanding, that is, all the thoughts of his perception which make the second degree; and there are all the things of the memory, or all ideas of the thought nearest to speech, taken from the memory, which present the third degree. Out of these things determined into act, come forth deeds, in which, seen in external form, prior things do not appear although they are actually therein. It may be seen above (<a href="209.htm">209-216</a>) that the outmost is the complex, containant and base of things prior, and that degrees of height are in fulness in their outmost (<a href="217.htm">217-221</a>). </p>

277. QUOD OMNIA, QUAE TRIUM GRADUUM MENTIS NATURALIS SUNT, OPERIBUS, QUAE FIUNT PER ACTUS CORPORIS, INCLUSA SINT. Per scientiam graduum, quae in hac Parte tradita est, detegitur hoc Arcanum, quod omnia mentis seu voluntatis et intellectus hominis, in actibus seu in operibus ejus sint, inclusa, vix aliter quam conspicua et inconspicua in semine, in fructu aut in ovo; ipsi actus seu opera non aliter apparent quam sicut illa in externis, sed usque in internis sunt innumerabilia, sunt enim vires fibrarum motricium totius corporis quae concurrunt, et sunt omnia mentis quae vires illas excitant et determinant, quae quod sint trium graduum, supra ostensum est; et quia sunt omnia mentis, sunt omnia voluntatis seu omnes affectiones amoris hominis, quae primum gradum constituunt; sunt omnia intellectus, seu omnes cogitationes perceptionis ejus, quae secundum gradum faciunt; et sunt omnia memoriae, seu omnes ideae cogitationis, <sup>1</sup>
quae proxima loquelae est, inde desumptae, quae tertium gradum sistunt; ex his in actum determinatis existunt opera, in quibus in externa forma visis non apparent priora, quae tamen actualiter insunt.
