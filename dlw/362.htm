<p>
362. Volition and discernment, the vessels of love and wisdom, are in the whole brain and every part of it and therefore in the whole body and every part of it. This will be explained in the following sequence.<p>1. Love and wisdom, and the volition and discernment that come from them, constitute our very life.<p>2. Our life is found in its primary forms in our brains and in secondary forms in our bodies.<p>3. The quality of a life in its primary forms determines its quality overall and in every part.<p>4. By means of its primary forms, life is in the whole from every part and in every part from the whole.<p>5. The quality of the love determines the quality of the wisdom and therefore the quality of the person. </p>

<p>
362. The will and intellect, which are the recipient vessels of love and wisdom, exist in the brain, in the whole and in every part of it, and consequently in the body, in the whole and in every part of it. We propose to demonstrate this according to the following outline:<p>(1) Love and wisdom, and consequently the will and intellect, constitute a person's very life.<p>(2) A person's life exists in its first elements in the brain, and in its derivative elements in the body.<p>(3) As life is in its first elements, so it is in the whole and in every part.<p>(4) Life through those first elements is present from every part in the whole, and from the whole in every part.<p>(5) The character of the love determines the character of the wisdom, and so the character of the person. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #362 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
362. THE WILL AND THE UNDERSTANDING, WHICH ARE THE RECEPTACLES OF LOVE AND WISDOM, ARE IN THE BRAINS, IN THE WHOLE AND EVERY PART OF THEM, AND HENCE IN THE BODY, IN THE WHOLE AND EVERY PART OF IT <p>These things must be shown as follows: <p>(i) Love and wisdom, and the will and the understanding therefrom, make the very life of man. <p>(ii) The life of man in its beginnings is in the brains and in its derivatives in the body. <p>(iii) Such as life is in its beginnings, such it is in the whole and every part. <p>(iv) By means of those beginnings, life is in the whole from every part, and in every part from the whole. <p>(v) Such as the love is, such is the wisdom, and therefore such is the man. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #362 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
362. WILL AND UNDERSTANDING, WHICH ARE THE RECEPTACLES OF LOVE AND WISDOM, ARE IN THE BRAINS, IN THE WHOLE AND IN EVERY PART OF THEM, AND THEREFROM IN THE BODY, IN THE WHOLE AND IN EVERY PART OF IT. <p>This shall be shown in the following order: <p>(1) Love and wisdom, and will and understanding therefrom, make the very life of man. <p>(2) The life of man in its first principles is in the brains, and in its derivatives in the body. <p>(3) Such as life is in its first principles, such it is in the whole and in every part. <p>(4) By means of first principles life is in the whole from every part, and in every part from the whole. <p>(5) Such as the love is, such is the wisdom, consequently such is the man. </p>

<p>
362. QUOD1 VOLUNTAS ET INTELLECTUS, QUAE SUNT RECEPTACULA AMORIS ET SAPIENTIAE, SINT IN CEREBRIS IN TOTO <sup>2</sup>
ET <sup>3</sup>
IN QUALIBET PARTE EORUM, ET INDE IN CORPORE IN TOTO ET IN QUALIBET PARTE EJUS. Haec demonstranda sunt hoc ordine. I. Quod Amor et Sapientia, et inde Voluntas et Intellectus, faciant ipsam vitam hominis. II. Quod vita hominis sit in principiis suis in Cerebris, et in principiatis in corpore. III. Quod qualis vita est in principiis, talis sit in toto et in qualibet parte. IV. Quod vita per principia illa sit ex qualibet parte in toto, et ex toto in qualibet parte. V. Qualis est amor, talis est sapientia, <sup>4</sup>
et inde talis est homo. <p>
