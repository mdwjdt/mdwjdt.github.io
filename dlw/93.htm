<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第93节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">2.3 灵界太阳不是神，而是神-人的神性之爱与神性智慧的一种发出；这太阳的热与光也是如此</h4><p>93、天使所看见并从中获得热与光的太阳，不是指主本身，而是指主的最先发出，也就是属灵之热的最高层。属灵之热的最高层是属灵之火，也就是神性之爱与神性智慧的第一对应形式。正因如此，该太阳显得炽热，在天使看来也是炽热的，但在世人看来不是。在世人看来炽热的火不是属灵的，而是属世的；这两种火之间的区别，犹如活物与死物之间的区别。因此，属灵的太阳以其热活跃属灵生物，更新属灵物体。属世太阳也以其热活跃属世生物，更新属世物体；然而不是靠它自身，而是通过属灵之热的流注，它只是作为一种物质为该流注提供辅助性的帮助。</p>

<p>
93. That sun is not God. Rather, it is an emanation from the divine love and wisdom of the Divine-Human One. The same is true of warmth and light from that sun. "The sun that angels see" (the sun that gives them warmth and light) does not mean the Lord himself. It means that first emanation from him that is the highest form of spiritual warmth. The highest form of spiritual warmth is spiritual fire, which is divine love and wisdom in its first correspondential form. This is why that sun looks fiery and also is fiery for angels, though it is not for us. What we experience as fire is not spiritual but physical, and the difference between these two is like the difference between life and death. The spiritual sun, then, brings spiritual people to life with its warmth and maintains spiritual things, while the physical sun does the same for physical people and things. It does not do this with its own power, though, but by an inflow of spiritual warmth that provides it with effective resources. </p>

93. That sun is not God, but it is an emanation from the Divine love and wisdom of the human God. So, too, the heat and light from that sun. In referring to that sun, visible to angels, from which they have their heat and light, we do not mean the Lord, but we mean the first emanation from Him, which is spiritual heat in its highest degree. Spiritual heat in its highest degree is spiritual fire, which is Divine love and wisdom in their first correspondent form.<p>So it is that that sun appears fiery, and to angels also is fiery, but not to people. The fire which is fire to people is not spiritual but natural, and the difference between these is as the difference between something animate and something inanimate. Therefore the spiritual sun by its heat animates spiritual beings and renews spiritual things, while the natural sun animates and renews natural beings and things, though doing so not on its own but as a result of an influx of spiritual heat, to which it contributes subsidiary assistance. </p>

<p>
93. THAT SUN IS NOT GOD BUT IT IS A GOING FORTH FROM THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM OF GOD-MAN; IT IS THE SAME WITH THE HEAT AND LIGHT FROM THAT SUN <p>By that Sun visible to the angels, from which they have heat and light, is not understood the Lord Himself, but there is understood the first proceeding from Him, which is the fulness of spiritual heat. The fulness of spiritual heat is spiritual fire, which is the Divine Love and Wisdom in its first correspondence. And so it is that that Sun appears fiery, and to the angels is also fiery, but not to men. Fire which is fire to men is not spiritual, but natural; between those fires there is a distinction like that between what is living and what is dead. Wherefore the spiritual Sun by its heat vivifies spiritual beings and renews spiritual things. But the natural sun indeed does the same for natural beings and natural things, yet not from itself, but by means of influx of spiritual heat to which it brings subsidiary power. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #93 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
93. THE SUN OF THE SPIRITUAL WORLD IS NOT GOD, BUT IS A PROCEEDING FROM THE DIVINE LOVE AND DIVINE WISDOM OF GOD-MAN; SO ALSO ARE THE HEAT AND LIGHT FROM THAT SUN. <p>By that sun which is before the eyes of the angels, and from which they have heat and light, is not meant the Lord Himself, but the first proceeding from Him, which is the highest [degree] of spiritual heat. The highest [degree] of spiritual heat is spiritual fire, which is Divine Love and Divine Wisdom in their first correspondence. On this account that sun appears fiery, and to the angels is fiery, but not to men. Fire which is fire to men is not spiritual, but natural; and between the two fires there is a difference like the difference between what is alive and what is dead. Therefore the spiritual sun by its heat vivifies spiritual beings and renews spiritual objects. The natural sun does the same for natural beings and natural objects; yet not from itself, but by means of an influx of spiritual heat, to which it renders aid as a kind of substitute. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #93 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
93. QUOD SOL ILLE NON SIT DEUS, SED QUOD SIT PROCEDENS EX DIVINO AMORE ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA DEI HOMINIS: SIMILITER CALOR ET LUX EX ILLO SOLE. Per Solem illum conspicuum Angelis, ex quo illis est Calor et Lux, non intelligitur ipse Dominus, sed intelligitur primum procedens ab Ipso, quod est summum caloris spiritualis; summum caloris spiritualis est spiritualis ignis, qui est Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia in sua prima correspondentia: inde est, quod Sol ille appareat igneus, et quoque quod sit igneus Angelis, sed non hominibus; ignis qui ignis hominibus non est spiritualis sed est naturalis, inter quos discrimen est sicut inter vivum et mortuum; quare Sol spiritualis per calorem vivificat spirituales, et redintegrat spiritualia; Sol autem naturalis quidem similiter naturales et naturalia, sed non ex se, verum per influxum caloris spiritualis, cui succenturiatam opem fert. </p>
