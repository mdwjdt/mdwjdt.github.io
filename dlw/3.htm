<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第3节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>3、对于爱是人的生命，我们可从世上太阳的热获得一些认识。众所周知，这热可以说是地上各种植被的共同生命。当春季气温回暖时，各种植物凭这热破土而出，装饰上叶子，然后开花，最后结果，从而在某种意义上活着。但当这热逐渐退去时，如秋冬时的情形，这些植物就会逐渐丧失生命迹象，枯萎凋零。人里面的爱也一样，因为热与爱互相对应。因此，爱也是热。</p>

<p>
3. We can get some idea that love is our life from the warmth of the sun in our world. We know this warmth acts like the life shared by all earth's plants because when it increases in the spring, plants of all kinds sprout from the soil. They dress themselves in their leafy finery and then in their blossoms and eventually in fruit. This is how they "live." When the warmth ebbs away, though, as it does in fall and winter, they are stripped of these signs of life and they wither. Love works the same way in us because love and warmth correspond to each other. This is why love makes us warm. </p>

3. Some idea of love as being a person's life may be had from the warmth of the sun in the world. People know that that warmth is, so to speak, the common life of all plant growth of the earth, for whenever it increases, as it does in springtime, plants of every kind rise up from the ground, are adorned with leaves, then flowers, and finally fruits, and so become in a way alive. On the other hand, when the warmth wanes, as it does in autumn and winter, the plants are divested of these signs of life and wither.<p>The same is the case with love in a person, for love and warmth correspond to each other. So it is, too, that love is warm. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #3 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
3. Some idea of love as being the life of man can be had by considering the sun's heat in the world. It is well known that this heat is a kind of common life of all forms of the earth's vegetation. For from this heat, as happens when it goes forth in springtime, plants of every kind rise out of the ground, are adorned with leaves, afterwards with flowers, and at last, with fruits, and thus in a sense they live. But when the heat recedes, as happens in the autumn and winter, the plants are stripped of these signs of their life and they wither. It is the same with love in man, for heat and love mutually correspond. For that reason also, love is warm. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #3 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
3. Some idea of love, as being the life of man, may be had from the sun's heat in the world. This heat is well known to be the common life, as it were, of all the vegetations of the earth. For by virtue of heat, coming forth in springtime, plants of every kind rise from the ground, deck themselves with leaves, then with blossoms, and finally with fruits, and thus, in a sense, live. But when, in the time of autumn and winter, heat withdraws, the plants are stripped of these signs of their life, and they wither. So it is with love in man; for heat and love mutually correspond. Therefore love also is warm. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #3 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
3. Aliqua idea de amore, quod sit vita hominis, haberi potest ex calore solis in mundo; ille quod sit sicut vita communis omnium vegetationum terrae, notum est, ex illo enim dum exoritur, quod fit tempore veris, vegetabilia omnis generis ex humo exsurgunt, ornantur foliis, postea floribus, et demum fructibus, et sic quasi vivunt; at cum calor recedit, quod fit tempore autumni et hyemis, illis vitae suae signis denudantur, et flaccescunt. Simile est cum amore apud hominem, nam correspondent sibi mutuo; quare etiam amor calet. </p>
