<h4 align="center"></h4><p>376、作为证明，我们可以在此引用在天上的天使当中所看到的意愿和理解力与心和肺的对应的代表。通过一种无法用语言描述的奇妙螺旋运动，天使们形成了一个心脏的样式和一个肺脏的样式，以及它们所包含的一切内部结构；然后，他们开始按照天堂的流动进行运作。因为天堂由于来自主的爱和智慧的流注而努力产生这种形式。天使就这样代表心与肺的结合，同时代表心和肺与意愿的爱和理解力的智慧的对应关系。他们将这种对应和结合称为天堂的婚姻，并声称有一种类似的婚姻就存在于整个身体及其个体肢体、器官和内脏，以及那里与心肺有关的成分中。此外，哪里没有心肺的运作和各自的交替，哪里就不可能有来自任何意愿成分的生命运动，以及来自任何理解力成分的生命感觉。</p>

<p>
376. In support of this I may include here a portrayal of the correspondence of volition and discernment with the heart and the lungs that I saw in the company of angels in heaven. By a fascinating flowing, spiral movement, beyond words to express, the angels formed an image of a heart and an image of lungs, including all the deeper tissues within them; and they followed the flow of heaven, since heaven tends toward forms like this because of the inflow of love and wisdom from the Lord. In this way they portrayed the union of the heart and the lungs and at the same time their correspondence with volition's love and discernment's wisdom. They call this correspondence and union a "heavenly marriage," and they say that it is the same throughout the body and in its individual members, organs, and viscera, with whatever is in them from the heart and the lungs. Further, anywhere that the heart and the lungs are not active, each in its turn, there can be no motion of life prompted by some voluntary principle and no sensation of life prompted by some cognitive principle. </p>

376. By way of confirmation we may cite here a representation of the correspondence of the will and intellect with the heart and lungs once seen in heaven in the company of angels.<p>By a marvelous whirling motion which no words can describe, they formed a likeness of the heart and a likeness of the lungs, with all the interior structures that they contain, and these then began to operate in conformity with the flow of heaven. For heaven endeavors to produce such forms owing to the influx of love and wisdom from the Lord. The angels thus represented the union of the heart and lungs, and at the same time their correspondence with the love of the will and with the wisdom of the intellect. They called this correspondence and union the heavenly marriage, saying that a like marriage exists in the whole body and in its individual members, organs and viscera, with those elements which are connected there with the heart and lungs. Moreover, where the heart and lungs do not operate and each maintain their alternations, there no motion of life is possible from any element of the will, and no sensation of life from any element of the intellect. </p>

<p>
376. Here, by way of evidence, it may be permitted to bring forward a representation of the correspondence of the will and understanding with the heart and lungs, seen in heaven among the angels. By a wonderful inflowing into spirals, inexpressible in words, they formed a likeness of the heart and lungs with all the internal structures therein, and in so doing they were following the flow of heaven, for heaven strives to come into forms like these by reason of the influx of love and wisdom from the Lord. In this manner they were representing the union of heart and lungs and at the same time the correspondence of these with the love of the will and the wisdom of the understanding. They called this correspondence and union the heavenly marriage, saying, that it is the same in the whole body and its individual members, organs and viscera as it is in those which belong to the heart and lungs; and that where the heart and lungs do not act and each perform its part, there can be no motion of life from any voluntary principle, and no sensation of life from any intellectual principle. </p>

<p>
376. It is permitted to introduce here, in the way of evidence, a representation of the correspondence of the will and understanding with the heart and lungs which was seen in heaven among the angels. By a wonderful flowing into spiral movements, such as no words can express, the angels formed the likeness of a heart and the likeness of lungs, with all the interior structures therein; and in this they were falling in with the flow of heaven, for heaven from the inflowing of love and wisdom from the Lord strives to come into such forms. They thus represented the conjunction of the heart and lungs, and at the same time the correspondence of these with the love of the will and with the wisdom of the understanding. This correspondence and union they called the heavenly marriage; saying that in the whole body, and in its several members, organs, and viscera, it is the same as in the things belonging to the heart and lungs; also that where the heart and lungs do not act, each in its turn, there can be no motion of life from any voluntary principle, and no sensation of life from any intellectual principle. </p>

376. Hic confirmationis gratia licet afferre repraesentationem Correspondentiae voluntatis et intellectus cum corde et pulmone visam in Coelo apud angelos: formabant illi per mirabilem et nullis vocibus expressibilem fluxionem in gyros, instar cordis et instar pulmonis cum omnibus contexturis interioribus quae in illis, et tunc sequebantur fluxum Coeli; nam Coelum connititur in tales formas ex influxu amoris et sapientiae <sup>1</sup>
a Domino; et sic repraesentabant conjunctionem cordis et pulmonis, et simul tunc correspondentiam illorum cum amore voluntatis et cum sapientia intellectus; hanc correspondentiam et unionem vocabant conjugium coeleste, <sup>2</sup>
dicentes, quod simile sit in toto corpore, ac in singulis ejus membris, organis et visceribus, cum illis quae ibi sunt cordis et pulmonis: ac ubi non cor et pulmo agit, et unumquodvis suas vices, ibi non possit dari aliquis motus vitae a principio aliquo voluntario, nec aliquis sensus vitae a principio aliquo intellectuali. <p>
