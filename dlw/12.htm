<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第12节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>12、普通的基督徒持有“神是一位人”的观念，因为在《亚他那修信经》关于三位一体的教义中，神被称为一个“人”。但那些比普通人有学问的人却声称神是不可见的；这是因为他们无法理解神作为一位人如何创造天与地，又如何以其同在充满整个宇宙等等；只要依旧不知道“神不在空间中”，这些问题就无法进入理解力。然而，那些唯独靠近主的人却思想一个神性人身，因而思想神是一位人。</p>

12. The ordinary concept of God among Christians is a concept of a person because God is called a person in the Athanasian doctrine of the Trinity. The better educated, though, claim that God is invisible. This is because they cannot understand how a human God could have created heaven and earth and filled the universe with his presence, along with other things that pass the bounds of understanding as long as people do not realize that Divinity is not in space. Still, people who turn to the Lord alone think of one who is both divine and human, and therefore think of God as a person. </p>

12. The common idea of God among ordinary Christians is one of a person, because God is called a person in the Athanasian doctrine of the Trinity. But those who are more sophisticated than ordinary people declare God to be invisible, and they do so because they cannot comprehend how God as a person could have created heaven and earth, filled the universe with His presence, and more - matters which cannot fall within the grasp of the intellect so long as it remains unknown that the Divine does not exist in space.<p>In contrast, people who go to the Lord alone think of His Divine Humanity, thus of God as a person. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #12 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
12. There is a common idea in the Christian world about God as a Man, because in the Athanasian doctrine of the Trinity, God is called a Person. But those who are wiser than the common people pronounce God to be invisible. They do so because they cannot comprehend how God, as a Man, could have created heaven and earth, then could have filled the universe with His presence, and many things besides which cannot penetrate the understanding so long as it is not known that the Divine is not in space. Those, however, who approach the Lord alone think of a Divine Human, thus of God as a Man. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #12 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
12. The common people in Christendom have an idea that God is a Man, because God in the Athanasian doctrine of the Trinity is called a "Person." But those who are more learned than the common people pronounce God to be invisible; and this for the reason that they cannot comprehend how God, as a Man, could have created heaven and earth, and then fill the universe with His presence, and many things besides, which cannot enter the understanding so long as the truth that the Divine is not in space is ignored. Those, however, who go to the Lord alone think of a Human Divine, thus of God as a Man. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #12 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
12. Plebeja idea in Christianismo de Deo est ut de Homine, quia Deus vocatur PERSONA in Doctrina Trinitatis Athanasiana: at qui supra plebem sapiunt, illi Deum invisibilem pronuntiant, quod fit quia non comprehendere <sup>1</sup>
possunt, quomodo Deus ut Homo creare potuisset Coelum et Terram, tum implere universum praesentia sua, et plura, quae non cadere possunt in intellectum, quamdiu ignoratur, quod Divinum non sit in spatio. Illi autem qui solum Dominum adeunt, Divinum Humanum cogitant, ita Deum ut Hominem. <p>
