<h4 align="center"></h4><p>106、如果灵界太阳距离天使不像自然界的太阳距离世人那样遥远，那么整个天使天堂，以及在它之下的地狱，并这些之下我们的水陆地球，就不会在主的注视、看顾、全在、全知、全能和治理之下了。这比较像我们尘世的太阳，它若不像它看上去的那样远离地球，就无法以其热和光在整个大地强有力地存在并发挥效力，因而不能作为一种物质为灵界太阳提供辅助性的帮助。</p>

106. If the spiritual world's sun did not seem to be as far from angels as the physical world's sun is from us, the whole angelic heaven, the hell underneath it, and our globe of lands and seas below them could not be under the Lord's watchful guidance, omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence, and providence. In the same way, if our world's sun were not at the distance from the earth where we see it to be, it could not be present and effective with its warmth and light in all our lands, so it could not provide its subsidiary resources to the spiritual world's sun. </p>

<p>
106. If the sun in the spiritual world did not appear as distant from the angels as the sun in the natural world does from people, the entire angelic heaven, and beneath it hell, and beneath these our terraqueous globe, would not be under the Lord's oversight, direction, omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence, and providence.<p>It is comparatively like the sun in our world. If our sun were not as distant from the earth as it appears, it could not be present and effectual in all lands by its heat and light. Thus it could not render subsidiary assistance to the sun of the spiritual world. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #106 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
106. If the Sun of the spiritual world did not appear at a distance from the angels just as the sun of the world does from men, the whole angelic heaven and hell beneath it, and below these our terraqueous globe, would not be under the attention, care, omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence and providence of the Lord, in the same way as the sun of our world, if it were not at such a distance from the earth as it appears, could not be present and powerful by its heat and light in all lands, thus could not perform a subsidiary use to the Sun of the spiritual world. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #106 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
106. If the sun of the spiritual world did not appear far off from the angels, like the sun of the natural world from men, the whole angelic heaven, and hell under it, and our terraqueous globe under these, would not be under the view, the care, the omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence, and providence of the Lord; comparatively as the sun of our world, if it were not at such a distance from the earth as it appears, could not be present and powerful in all lands by its heat and light, and therefore could not render its aid, as a kind of substitute, to the sun of the spiritual world. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #106 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
106. Si Sol Mundi spiritualis non appareret distans ab Angelis, sicut Sol Mundi naturalis ab hominibus, non foret universum Coelum Angelicum, ac sub illo infernum, et sub illis terraqueus noster Orbis, sub Domini intuitione, Auspicio, Omnipraesentia, Omniscientia, Omnipotentia et Providentia: comparative sicut Sol Mundi nostri, ille nisi foret in tali distantia a tellure, in qua apparet, non potuisset praesens et potens esse in omnibus terris per calorem et lucem, ita non potuisset succenturiatam opem Soli Mundi spiritualis praestare. </p>
