<h4 align="center"></h4><p>95、仅从实际经验就能明显看出，爱产生热，智慧产生光。当人热爱时，他会变得温暖；当他智慧地思考时，就好像在光中看见事物。由此明显可知，爱的最先发出是热，智慧的最先发出是光。显然，它们也是对应的；因为热并非存在于爱本身，而是从爱在意愿，进而在身体中产生；光并非存在于智慧，而是存在于理解力的思维，进而存在于言语。因此，爱与智慧是热与光的本质与生命。热与光就是那发出之物，它们因是那发出之物，故也是对应。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #95 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
95. It is obvious from actual experience that love generates warmth and wisdom generates light. When we feel love, we become warmer, and when we think from wisdom, it is like seeing things in the light. We can see from this that the first thing that emanates from love is warmth and that the first thing that emanates from wisdom is light.<p>We can also see that these are correspondences, since the warmth does not occur within the love itself but as a result of it, in our volition and therefore in our bodies. The light does not occur within the wisdom, but in the thinking of our discernment and therefore in our speaking. That is, love and wisdom are the essence and life of warmth and light; and warmth and light are emanations from love and wisdom. Because they are emanations from them, they are also responsive to them. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #95 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
95. That love produces heat, and wisdom light, is evident from simply the experience of it. When a person loves, he grows warm, and when he thinks wisely, he sees things as though in light. It is apparent from this that the first emanation of love is heat, and the first emanation of wisdom is light.<p>It is apparent that they are also correspondent forms, for warmth does not exist in the love itself, but arises from it in the will and so in the body, and light does not exist in wisdom, but in the thought of the intellect and so in the speech.<p>Consequently love and wisdom are the essence and life in heat and light. Heat and light are what emanate from them, and because they are emanations, they are also correspondent forms. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #95 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
95. It is obvious from actual experience that love produces heat, and wisdom light. When a man loves he grows warm, and when he thinks from wisdom he sees things as it were in light; and from this it is evident that the first proceeding of love is heat, and the first proceeding of wisdom is light. That they are also correspondences is evident; for heat does not exist in love itself, but from love in the will and hence in the body; and light does not exist in wisdom, but in the thought of the understanding, and hence in speech. Wherefore love and wisdom are the essence and life of heat and light. Heat and light are what proceed, and because they are what proceed, they are also correspondences. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #95 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
95. That love begets heat, and wisdom light, is manifest from actual experience. When man loves he grows warm, and when he thinks from wisdom he sees things as it were in light. And from this it is evident that the first proceeding of love is heat, and that the first proceeding of wisdom is light. That they are also correspondences is obvious; for heat takes place [existit] not in love itself, but from love in the will, and thence in the body; and light takes place not in wisdom, but in the thought of the understanding, and thence in the speech. Consequently love and wisdom are the essence and life of heat and light. Heat and light are what proceed, and because they are what proceed, they are also correspondences. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #95 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
95. Quod Amor producat calorem, et Sapientia lucem, manifestum est ex ipsa experientia; homo dum amat incalescit, et cum ex Sapientia cogitat videt res quasi in luce: ex quo patet, quod primum procedens amoris sit calor, et primum procedens sapientiae sit lux. Quod correspondentiae sint etiam, patet, nam calor non existit in ipso amore, sed ex illo in voluntate et inde in corpore; et lux non existit in sapientia, sed in intellectus cogitatione et inde in loquela. Quare amor et sapientia sunt essentia et vita caloris et lucis; calor et lux sunt procedentia, et quia sunt procedentia, sunt etiam correspondentiae. </p>
