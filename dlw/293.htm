<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第293节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>293、我还发觉，一种气场不仅从天使和灵人发出，还从出现在灵界的每一个事物发出，如树木及其果实，灌木及其花朵，菜蔬和青草，甚至土壤及其每个粒子。由此明显可知，无论对于活物还是对于死物来说，一个普遍现象是：每种事物都被类似存在于它里面之物的某种东西包裹，并且这种东西不断从它散发出来。从许多学者的观察资料可以得知，这种现象可见于自然界。例如，他们知道，大量气息源源不断地从每个人，同样从每个动物，以及每棵树、每颗果实、每一丛灌木和每朵花，甚至从每块金属和石头流出来。自然界的这种特征源于灵界，而灵界的这种特征源于神性。</p>

293. I have also noticed that an aura flows out not only from angels and spirits but also from absolutely everything you see in that world--from trees and their fruits there, for example, from shrubs and their blossoms, from plants and grasses, even from soils and their particles. I could therefore see that this is a universal characteristic of things both living and lifeless, that everything is surrounded by something resembling what lies within it and that this is constantly breathing forth.<p>The experience of numerous scholars informs us that something like this happens in the physical world. For example, an outgoing wave is constantly flowing from individuals and from every animal, also from trees, fruits, shrubs, and flowers, and even from metals and stones. The physical world gets this from the spiritual world, and the spiritual world gets it from Divinity. </p>

293. I have perceived, too, that an atmosphere radiates not only from angels and spirits but also from each and every object appearing in their world, as from trees and their fruits there, from bushes and their flowers, from herbs and grasses, even from soils and every one of their constituents. It has been apparent from this that it is a universal phenomenon, both in the case of living things and in that of lifeless ones, that each is enveloped by something like that which exists within, and that this is continually exhaled from it.<p>The same phenomenon is found in the natural world, as people know from the observations of many learned investigators. They know, for example, that a flood of effluvia constantly flows from every person, likewise from every animal, and also from every tree, fruit, bush, and flower, indeed from every metal and rock.<p>The natural world draws this characteristic from the spiritual world, and the spiritual world from the Divine. </p>

293. It was also perceived that a sphere issues forth, not only from angels and spirits, but also from each and all things that appear in the spiritual world, as from trees and from their fruits there, from shrubs and their flowers, from herbs and from grasses, even from the soils and their very particles. And from this it was clear that, both in the case of things living and things dead, this is a universal law, that each thing is encompassed by something like that which is within it, and that this is continually exhaled from it. It is well known, from the experience of many learned men, that it is the same in the natural world, that there is a wave of effluvia constantly flowing forth out of man, as well as out of every animal, and also out of every tree, fruit, shrub, flower, and even out of metal and stone. The natural world derives this from the spiritual world, and the spiritual world from the Divine. </p>

293. It was also perceived that a sphere flows forth, not only from angels and spirits but also from each and all things that appear in the spiritual world, - from trees and from their fruits, from shrubs and from their flowers, from herbs, and from grasses, even from the soils and from their very particles. From which it was patent that both in the case of things living and things dead this is a universal law, That each thing is encompassed by something like that which is within it, and that this is continually exhaled from it. It is known, from the observation of many learned men, that it is the same in the natural world - that is, that there is a wave of effluvia constantly flowing forth out of man, also out of every animal, likewise out of tree, fruit, shrub, flower, and even out of metal and stone. This the natural world derives from the spiritual, and the spiritual world from the Divine. </p>

293. Perceptum etiam est, quod sphaera non solum ex angelis et spiritibus exundet, sed etiam ex omnibus et singulis quae in illo Mundo apparent, ut ex arboribus et ex illarum fructibus ibi, ex virgultis et ex eorum floribus, ex herbis et ex graminibus, imo ex terris et ex singulis illarum; ex quibus patuit, quod hoc Universale sit tam in vivis quam in mortuis, quod unumquodvis a simili, quod intus in illo est, circumstipetur, et quod hoc continue ab illo exhaletur. Quod simile sit in Mundo naturali, ab experientia plurium Eruditorum, notum est; ut quod unda effluviorum ex homine jugiter effluat, tum ex quovis animali, et quoque ex arbore, fructu, virgulto, flore, imo ex metallo et lapide: hoc trahit Mundus naturalis ex Mundo spirituali, et Mundus spiritualis ex Divino. </p>
