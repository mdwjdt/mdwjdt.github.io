<h4 align="center"></h4><p>150、启示或光照是圣灵的属性，它虽从主存在于人里面，却仍须通过作为媒介的灵人和天使实现。不过，这种居间调解的性质无法描述；只能说，天使和灵人决不能凭自己启示人，因为他们同样是人，也要被主启示；由于他们同样被启示，故可知，一切启示或光照唯独来自主。启示之所以通过作为媒介的天使或灵人实现，是因为处于启示状态的人被置于接受的启示比其他人更多的天使和灵人中间，这些启示或光照唯独来自主。</p>

150. While the enlightenment attributed to the Holy Spirit actually comes from the Lord, it happens through the agency of spirits and angels. I cannot yet describe what kind of agency it is, but can say only that in no way can angels and spirits enlighten us on their own because they, like us, are enlightened by the Lord. Since they are enlightened in this same way, it follows that all enlightenment is from the Lord alone. It happens through angels and spirits because when we are receiving enlightenment we are surrounded by the angels and spirits who are receiving more enlightenment than others from the Lord alone. </p>

150. The enlightenment attributed to the Holy Spirit exists indeed in people from the Lord, but still it is effected by means of spirits and angels. However, the nature of that intermediation cannot yet be described, except to say that angels and spirits cannot in the least enlighten people on their own, because they themselves are enlightened by the Lord in the same way as people; and because they are themselves enlightened in the same way, it follows that all enlightenment comes from the Lord alone.<p>We say that enlightenment occurs by means of angels or spirits because a person in a state of enlightenment is then placed in the midst of angels and spirits who more than others receive enlightenment from the Lord alone. </p>

150. Enlightenment, which is attributed to the Holy Spirit, is indeed in a man from the Lord, but yet it is effected by mediating spirits and angels. But the nature of that mediation cannot yet be described, only that angels and spirits cannot by any means enlighten man from themselves, because they, like man, are enlightened by the Lord. And because they are enlightened in like manner, it follows that all enlightenment is from the Lord alone. It is effected by mediating angels and spirits because the man who is in enlightenment, is then placed in the midst of such angels and spirits as receive, more than others, enlightenment from the Lord alone. </p>

<p>
150. Enlightenment, which is attributed to the Holy Spirit, is indeed in man from the Lord, yet it is effected by spirits and angels as media. But the nature of that mediation cannot yet be described; only it may be said that angels and spirits can in no way enlighten man from themselves, because they, in like manner as man, are enlightened by the Lord; and as they are enlightened in like manner, it follows that all enlightenment is from the Lord alone. It is effected by angels or spirits as media, because the man when he is enlightened is placed in the midst of such angels and spirits as, more than others, receive enlightenment from the Lord alone. </p>

150. Illustratio, quae attribuitur Spiritui sancto, est quidem in homine a Domino, sed usque fit mediis spiritibus et angelis; at qualis illa mediatio est, non potest adhuc describi; solum quod angeli et spiritus nequicquam possint illustrare hominem a se, quia illi illustrantur similiter ac homo a Domino; et quia illi similiter illustrantur, sequitur quod omnis illustratio sit a solo Domino: quod sit mediis angelis aut spiritibus, est quia homo qui in illustratione est, ponitur tunc in medio talium angelorum et spirituum, qui illustrationem a solo Domino plus quam alii recipiunt. </p>
