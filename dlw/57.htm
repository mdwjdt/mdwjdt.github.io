<h4 align="center"></h4><p>57、正因如此，天使之为天使，不是凭他们自己，而是凭与神-人的这种结合；该结合取决于对神性良善与神性真理的接受，而神性良善与神性真理就是神，看似从神发出，其实在神里面。这种接受则取决于他们在行使照理性思考和意愿的自由中将秩序的法则，也就是神性真理运用到自己身上的程度；他们从神拥有这种自由，仿佛这自由就是他们自己的。他们由此貌似凭自己接受神性良善与神性真理，爱的相互性也由此产生；因为如前所述，爱若不是相互的，是不可能的。这同样适用于世人。综上所述，首知受造宇宙的一切事物都是神-人的神性之爱与神性智慧的接受者。</p>

57. This is why angels are not angels in their own right but are angels by virtue of their union with the Divine-Human One; and their union depends on their acceptance of what is divinely good and what is divinely true. What is divinely good and what is divinely true are God, and seem to emanate from him even though they are within him. Their acceptance depends on the way angels apply the laws of his design, which are divine truths, to themselves, using their freedom to think and intend according to their reason, a freedom given them by God as their own possession. This is what enables them to accept what is divinely good and divinely true in apparent autonomy; and this in turn is what makes possible the mutual element in their love, for as already noted [<a href="48.htm" target=_top>48</a>], love is not real unless it is mutual. It is the same with us here on earth.<p>All this enables us finally to see that everything in the created universe is a vessel for the divine love and wisdom of the Divine-Human One. </p>

57. It is owing to this that angels are not angels of themselves, but are angels in consequence of their conjunction with the human God; and that conjunction depends on their reception of Divine good and Divine truth, which are God, and which appear to emanate from Him, even though they are in Him. Moreover, their reception depends on their application of the laws of order - which Divine truths are - to themselves, because of their freedom to think and will in accordance with reason, faculties that they have from the Lord as though they were theirs. The result is their reception of Divine good and Divine truth as though of themselves, and this makes possible a reciprocation of love; for as we said above, <sup>1</sup>
love does not exist unless it is reciprocal.<p>The same is the case with people on earth.<p>From these observations it can now for the first time be seen that every constituent of the created universe is a recipient of the Divine love and wisdom of the human God.<p>

57. It is from this that angels are not angels from themselves, but they are angels by virtue of this conjunction with God-Man. And this conjunction is in accordance with their reception of Divine Good and Divine Truth which are God, and seem to proceed from Him although they are in Him. The reception, however, is in accordance with their application to themselves of the laws of order which are Divine truths, as a result of the freedom of thinking and willing according to reason which they have from the Lord as their own. By this they have reception, as if from themselves, of Divine Good and Divine Truth, and through this there is reciprocity of love. For as was said above, love is not possible unless it be reciprocal. It is the same with men on earth. From what has been said it can now first be seen that all things of the created universe are recipients of the Divine Love and Wisdom of God-Man. </p>

57. From this it is that angels are angels, not from themselves, but by virtue of this conjunction with God-Man; and this conjunction is according to the reception of Divine Good and Divine Truth, which are God, and which seem to proceed from Him, though really they are in Him. This reception is according to their application to themselves of the laws of order, which are Divine truths, in the exercise of that freedom of thinking and willing according to reason, which they possess from the Lord as if it were their own. By this they have a reception, as if from themselves, of Divine Good and of Divine Truth, and by this there is a reciprocation of love; for, as was said above, love is impossible unless it is reciprocal. The same is true of men on the earth. From what has been said it can now first be seen that all things of the created universe are recipients of the Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom of God-Man. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #57 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
57. Ex eo est, quod Angeli non sint Angeli a se, sed quod sint Angeli ex conjunctione illa cum Deo Homine, et illa conjunctio est secundum receptionem Divini Boni et Divini Veri, quae sunt Deus, et apparent procedere ab Ipso, tametsi in Ipso sunt; ac receptio est secundum applicationem legum ordinis, quae sunt Divinae Veritates, ad se, ex libero cogitandi et volendi secundum rationem, quae illis sunt a Domino sicut eorum; per id est illis receptio Divini Boni et Divini Veri sicut ab illis, et per id est reciprocum amoris, nam, ut supra dictum est, amor non datur nisi sit reciprocus. Simile est cum hominibus in terris. Ex dictis primum videri potest, quod omnia Universi Creati sint Divini Amoris et Divinae Sapientiae Dei Hominis recipientia. </p>
