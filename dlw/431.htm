<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第431节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>431、对此，我要补充以下值得注意的经历：在天堂，所有出于对功用的情感履行功用的人，都由于他们所过的共同分享的生活而比其他人更智慧、更幸福。对他们来说，履行功用就是在各自的职业工作中行事诚实、正直、公义、忠诚。他们将这一切称为仁爱，将与敬拜有关的仪式称为仁爱的象征，将其它东西称为责任和慈善行为；声称，当每个人都诚实、正直、公义、忠诚地履行自己的工作职责时，整体利益就得到维护和持续。他们还说，这就是“在主里面”，因为从主所流入的一切都是功用，这功用从部分流入整体，从整体流入部分。那里的部分就是天使，整体则是天使的一个社群。</p>

431. I should like to add a matter of interest. All the people in heaven who are engaged in being of service because they enjoy doing it derive from their collective body a wisdom and happiness greater than that of others. As far as they are concerned, being of service means being honest, fair, proper, and faithful in whatever task is appropriate to their station. This is what they call "charity," and they refer to their acts of formal worship as emblems of charity. Anything else is a duty or a good deed. They say that whenever they do the tasks proper to their station honestly, fairly, properly, and faithfully, the collective body takes on substance and permanence in their good work. This is what it means to be "in the Lord," since everything that flows into them from the Lord has to do with service; and it flows from the members into the collective body and from the collective body into the members. The members there are angels, and the collective body is their community. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #431 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
431. To this I will add the following report. In heaven, all those who perform useful services from an affection for useful service derive from the fellowship in which they live the characteristic of being wiser and happier than others. And to perform useful services is, for them there, to act honestly, rightly, justly and faithfully in the work connected with one's occupation. They call this charity - calling the venerations connected with worship symbols of charity, and everything else duties and benefactions - saying that when everyone does the work connected with his occupation honestly, rightly, justly and faithfully, the whole is maintained and preserved in its common good. They say, too, that this is what it is to be in the Lord, since everything that flows in from the Lord is a useful endeavor, which flows from the parts into the whole, and from the whole to the parts. The parts there are angels, and the whole is the society in which they live. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #431 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
431. To the above I will add this memorable fact. In heaven all who perform uses from an affection for use draw from the life which they share in common, a state of wisdom and happiness exceeding that of others. And there, with them, performing uses means acting sincerely, uprightly, justly, and faithfully, in the work of their employment. This they call charity, and acts of worship they call signs of charity, and other things they call duties and privileges; declaring that when anyone does the work of his employment sincerely, uprightly, justly, and faithfully, the community abides and continues steadfast in its state of good, and that this is to "be in the Lord," since everything that flows in from the Lord is a use, and flows in from the parts into the community, and from the community to the parts. The parts there are angels, and the community is a society of them. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #431 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
431. To this I will add the following notable experience:-In heaven all who perform uses from affection for use, because of the communion in which they live are wiser and happier than others; and with them performing uses is acting sincerely, uprightly, justly, and faithfully in the work proper to the calling of each. This they call charity; and observances pertaining to worship they call signs of charity, and other things they call obligations and favors; saying that when one performs the duties of his calling sincerely, uprightly, justly, and faithfully, the good of the community is maintained and perpetuated, and that this is to "be in the Lord," because all that flows in from the Lord is use, and it flows in from the parts into the community, and flows out from the community to the parts. The parts there are angels, and the community is a society of them. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #431 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
431. His adjiciam hoc memorabile: in Coelo omnes, qui usus faciunt ex affectione usus, ex communione, in qua sunt, trahunt quod sint aliis sapientiores et feliciores; ac usus facere illis ibi est, sincere, recte, juste et fideliter agere in Opere quod ejus officii est; hoc vocant charitatem, ac adorationes quae sunt cultus vocant signa charitatis, et reliqua vocant debita et beneficia; dicentes quod dum quisque sincere, recte, juste et fideliter facit opus quod ejus officii est, Commune in suo bono subsistat et persistat; et quod hoc sit in Domino esse, quoniam omne quod a Domino influit est usus, ac influit a partibus in commune, et a communi ad partes; partes ibi sunt angeli, et commune est societas illorum. </p>
