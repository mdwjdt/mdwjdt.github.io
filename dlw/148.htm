<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第148节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>148、由于神性本身通过属灵之热和光存在于天使和世人里面，所以那些拥有神性智慧的真理和神性之爱的良善之人当被这些事物打动，出于情感从它们思想，并思想它们时，就说他们因神而变得温暖。有时这种温暖能明显被觉察和感受到，如传道人热情讲道时的情形。这些人也可以说是被神启示，因为主通过祂所发出的神性，不仅以属灵之热点燃意愿，还以属灵之光启示理解力。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #148 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
148. Since Divinity itself is present with angels and with us through its spiritual warmth and light, we look at people who are caught up in the truth of divine wisdom and the goodness of divine love, who are moved by them, and who are therefore in heartfelt thought, and we say that they are being "warmed by God." Sometimes this happens so openly that it can be noticed and felt, as when a preacher speaks with passion. We also say of such people that they are being "enlightened by God" because with his emanating divinity, the Lord not only kindles human intentions with spiritual warmth but also floods human minds with spiritual light. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #148 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
148. Since the Divine itself is present in angels and people by means of spiritual warmth and light, therefore when those possessing truths of Divine wisdom and goods of Divine love are affected by those truths and goods and think in accord with them about them with affection, they are said to grow warm in God. At times this becomes also apparent to people's perception and sensation, as when a preacher is speaking with zeal.<p>These same people are also said to be enlightened by God, because by His emanating Divinity the Lord not only ignites the will with spiritual warmth but also enlightens the intellect with spiritual light. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #148 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
148. Since the Divine itself is present in an angel and a man by means of spiritual heat and light, therefore it is said of those who are in the truths of Divine Wisdom and in the goods of Divine Love, when affected by them, and from affection think from them and about them, that they grow warm from God. This also becomes [evident] to perception and feeling as when a preacher speaks from fervour. It is also said of those that they are enlightened by God, because the Lord, by means of His Divine Proceeding, not only kindles the will with spiritual heat, but also enlightens the understanding with spiritual light. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #148 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
148. As the Divine Itself is present in angel and man by spiritual heat and light, those who are in the truths of Divine Wisdom and in the goods of Divine Love, when affected by these, and when from affection they think from them and about them, are said to grow warm with God; and this sometimes becomes so evident as to be perceived and felt, as when a preacher speaks from zeal. These same are also said to be enlightened by God, because the Lord, by His proceeding Divine, not only kindles the will with spiritual heat, but also enlightens the understanding with spiritual light. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #148 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
148. Quoniam ipsum Divinum per calorem et lucem spiritualem in angelo et in homine est praesens, ideo dicitur de illis, qui in veris Divinae Sapientiae et in bonis Divini Amoris sunt, dum afficiuntur illis, et ex affectione cogitant ex illis de illis, quod incalescant Deo, quod fit etiam quandoque ad perceptionem et sensationem, ut dum Praedicator ex Zelo loquitur: de iisdem etiam dicitur, quod illustrentur a Deo, quia Dominus per Divinum suum procedens non modo accendit voluntatem Calore spirituali, sed etiam illustrat intellectum Luce spirituali. </p>
