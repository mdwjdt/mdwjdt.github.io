<h4 align="center"></h4><p>84、由于这两个世界如此不同，所以显而易见，灵界必在不同于自然界的另一轮太阳之下。因为灵界也有热和光在里面，和自然界一样；只是那里的热和光是属灵的；属灵之热是仁之良善，属灵之光是信之真理。由于热和光只能源于太阳，所以很明显，灵界有一轮不同于自然界的太阳；而且灵界的太阳就其本质而言，具有这样的性质：属灵的热和光能从它发出；而自然界的太阳就其本质而言，具有这样的性质：属世的热和光能从它发出。一切属灵事物皆与良善和真理有关，只能源于神性之爱和神性智慧；因为一切良善皆属于爱，一切真理皆属于智慧。凡有智慧的人都能看出，它们并没有其它源头。</p>

84. Because these two worlds are so distinct from each other, it is quite obvious that the spiritual world is under a different sun than is the physical world. There is just as much warmth and light in the spiritual world as there is in the physical world, but the warmth there is spiritual and so is the light. Spiritual warmth is the good that thoughtfulness does and spiritual light is the truth that faith perceives.<p>Now, since the only possible source of warmth and light is a sun, it stands to reason that there is a different sun in the spiritual world than there is in the physical world. It also stands to reason that because of the essential nature of the spiritual world's sun, spiritual warmth and light can come forth from it, while because of the essential nature of the physical world's sun, physical warmth [and light] can come forth from it. The only possible source of anything spiritual--that is, anything that has to do with what is good and true--is divine love and wisdom. Everything good is a result of love and everything true is a result of wisdom. Any wise individual can see that this is their only possible source. </p>

84. Since these two worlds are so different, it can be clearly seen that the spiritual world exists under another sun than that of the natural world. For the spiritual world has in it heat and light just like the natural world - only the heat there is spiritual, and so, too, the light; and spiritual heat is the good of charity, and spiritual light is the truth of faith.<p>Now, because heat and light can originate from no other source than a sun, it can be seen that there is in the spiritual world another sun than that in the natural world, and furthermore that the sun in the spiritual world is in its essence of such a character that spiritual heat and light can emanate from it, while the sun in the natural world is in its essence of such a character that natural heat and light can emanate from it.<p>Everything spiritual has some relation to good and truth, and as such it can spring from no other origin than Divine love and wisdom, for all good is connected with love, and all truth with wisdom. That these spring from no other origin every wise person can see. </p>

84. Since those two worlds are thus distinct, it can easily be seen that the spiritual world is under a Sun other than that of the natural world. For in the spiritual world there is heat and light as there is in the natural world, but the heat there is spiritual and similarly the light, and spiritual heat is the good of charity and spiritual light is the truth of faith. Now because heat and light cannot draw their origin from any other source than from a sun, it can be established that in the spiritual world there is a Sun other than that in the natural world, and further, that the Sun of the spiritual world is, in its essence, such that spiritual heat and light can come into existence from it, and that the sun of the natural world, is, in its essence, such that natural heat can come into existence from it. Everything spiritual has reference to good and truth and can arise from no other source than from the Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom. For every good is of love and every truth is of wisdom. That it cannot be otherwise, every wise man can see. </p>

84. Since these two worlds are so distinct, it can be seen very clearly that the spiritual world is under another sun than the natural world. For in the spiritual world, must as in the natural, there is heat and light; but the heat there, as well as the light, is spiritual; and spiritual heat is the good of charity, and spiritual light is the truth of faith. Now since heat and light can originate only in a sun, it is evident that the spiritual world has a different sun from the natural world; and further, that the sun of the spiritual world in its essence is such that spiritual heat and light can come forth from it; whereas the sun of the natural world in its essence is such that natural heat can come forth from it. Everything spiritual has relation to good and truth, and can spring from no other source than Divine Love and Divine Wisdom; for all good is of love and all truth is of wisdom; that they have no other origin any discerning man can see. </p>

84. Quoniam duo illi Mundi ita distincti sunt, perspicue videri potest, quod Mundus spiritualis sub alio Sole sit quam Mundus naturalis: in Mundo enim spirituali aeque est Calor et Lux, ut in Mundo naturali; sed calor ibi est Spiritualis, et lux similiter, et calor Spiritualis est bonum charitatis, et lux Spiritualis est verum fidei. Nunc quia calor et lux non possunt aliunde originem ducere quam ex Sole, constare potest, quod in Mundo Spirituali sit alius Sol quam in Mundo naturali, tum etiam quod Sol Mundi spiritualis sit in sua essentia talis, ut ex illo calor et lux Spiritualis possit existere, et quod sol mundi naturalis sit in sua essentia talis, ut ex illo calor [et lux] naturalis possit existere: omne Spirituale, quod se refert ad bonum et verum, non aliunde potest exoriri, quam ex Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia, omne bonum enim est amoris, et omne verum est Sapientiae: quod non aliunde, omnis sapiens potest videre. </p>
