<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第138节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>138、转向主是实实在在的转向，是一种提升；因为此人被提入天堂的热与光中，这种提升是通过打开内层实现的。当内层被打开时，爱与智慧便流入心智的内层，天堂的热与光则流入身体的内层。提升由此而来，就像从云层升入晴空，或从大气升入太空。此外，爱与智慧，及其热与光，就是与人同在的主；如前所述，祂将人转向祂自己。那些没有处于爱与智慧的人，尤其那些反对爱与智慧的人正好相反。他们的内层，无论心智的还是身体的，都是关闭的；一旦关闭，外层就与主对立，因为这是外层固有的性质。结果，这种人背对主，背对主就是转向地狱。</p>

<p>
138. This turning toward the Lord is an active turning--it is a kind of lifting up. We are actually lifted into heaven's warmth and light, and this is accomplished by an opening of our inner reaches. When these have been opened, love and wisdom flow into the deeper reaches of our minds and heaven's warmth and light flow into the deeper reaches of our bodies. This results in a lifting, as though we were brought out of the mist into clear air, or out of the air into the ether. Further, love and wisdom, together with their warmth and light, are the Lord with us, the Lord who, as already noted [<a href="130.htm" target=_top>130</a>], turns us toward himself.<p>The opposite holds for people who are not engaged in love and wisdom, and all the more for people who resist love and wisdom. The deeper reaches of their minds and bodies alike are closed; and when they are closed, then their outer natures resist the Lord because this is their inherent nature. This is why such people turn away from the Lord, and this "turning away" is a turning toward hell. </p>

<p>
138. This turning to the Lord is an actual one, entailing a certain elevation; for the person is elevated into the warmth and light of heaven, which is occasioned by the opening of his interior elements. When these are opened, love and wisdom flow into the interior elements of his mind, and the warmth and light of heaven into the interior elements of his body. This produces the elevation, an elevation which is like rising from a cloud into open air, or like rising from the air into the stratosphere. Love and wisdom with their warmth and light are then the Lord in the person, and it is the Lord in the person who, as we said above, <sup>1</sup>
turns the person to Him.<p>The contrary is the case in people who are not in a state of love and wisdom, and still more in those who are opposed to love and wisdom. In them the interior elements of both mind and body are closed, and when they are closed, the outward elements act in opposition to the Lord, for it is inherent in their nature to do so. The result is that such people turn their back to the Lord, and to turn one's back to the Lord is to turn toward hell.<p>

<p>
138. This turning to the Lord is an actual turning. It is a kind of elevation. For the man is elevated into the heat and light of heaven, which is brought about by the interiors being opened. And when these are opened, love and wisdom flow into the interiors of the mind, and heat and light into the interiors of the body. Thence the elevation, as of cloud into air, or of air into ether. Moreover, love and wisdom with their heat and light are the Lord with man, and He, as was said before, turns man to Himself. It is the reverse with those who are not in love and wisdom and more so with those who are opposed to love and wisdom. Their interiors, both of mind and body, are closed. And when closed, the exteriors re-act against the Lord, for such is their inherent nature. That is the reason they turn themselves backward from the Lord. And turning oneself backwards is to turn towards hell. </p>

<p>
138. This turning to the Lord is an actual turning, a kind of elevation; for there is an uplifting into the heat and light of heaven, which takes place by the opening of the interiors; when these are opened, love and wisdom flow into the interiors of the mind, and the heat and light of heaven into the interiors of the body. From this comes the uplifting, like a rising out of a cloud into clear air, or out of air into ether. Moreover, love and wisdom, with their heat and light, are the Lord with man; and He, as was said before, turns man to Himself. It is the reverse with those who are not in love and wisdom, and still more with those who are opposed to love and wisdom. Their interiors, both of mind and body, are closed; and when closed, the exteriors re-act against the Lord, for such is their inherent nature. Consequently, such persons turn themselves backward from the Lord; and turning oneself backward is turning to hell. </p>

<p>
138. Conversio illa ad Dominum est actualis conversio; est quaedam elevatio; elevatur enim in calorem et lucem coeli, quod fit per quod aperiantur interiora, quae cum aperta sunt, influit amor et sapientia in interiora mentis, ac calor et lux coeli in interiora corporis[;] inde elevatio, quae est sicut e nimbo <sup>1</sup>
in aerem, seu ex aere in aetherem; ac amor et sapientia cum eorum calore et luce sunt Dominus apud hominem, qui, ut prius dictum est, vertit illum ad se. Contrarium est apud illos qui non in amore et sapientia, et magis apud illos qui contra amorem et sapientiam sunt[;] illorum interiora tam mentis quam corporis clausa sunt, et cum clausa sunt, exteriora reagunt contra Dominum, nam talis illis natura inest; inde est, quod illi se vertant retro a Domino, ac vertere se retro, est ad infernum. <p>
