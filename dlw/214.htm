<h4 align="center"></h4><p>214、情感、思维和行为也处于一系列类似层级，因为一切情感都与爱有关，一切思维都与智慧有关，一切行为都与功用有关。仁、信、善行同样处于一系列类似层级，因为仁属乎情感，信属乎思维，善行属乎行为。意愿、理解力和行为亦处于一系列类似层级，因为意愿属乎爱，因而属乎情感，理解力属乎智慧，因而属乎信，行为属乎功用，因而属乎作为。由于智慧和爱的一切品质都存在于功用，所以思维和情感的一切品质都存在于行为，信和仁的一切品质都存在于善行等等。不过，这一切必是同质的，也就是说，是一致的。</p>

<p>
214. Desire, thought, and act occur on a sequence of similar levels, since every desire has to do with love, every thought with wisdom, and every act with service. Charity, faith, and good works occur on the same sequence of levels, since charity is a matter of desire, faith of thought, and good works of act. Volition, discernment, and practice occur on the same sequence of levels as well, since volition is a matter of love and therefore of desire, discernment of wisdom and therefore of faith, and practice of service and therefore of deeds. Just as all the elements of wisdom and love dwell within service, all the elements of thought and desire dwell within act, and all the elements of faith and charity dwell within deeds, and so on. This means all the elements that are of the same kind, that are harmonious. </p>

214. Affection, thought and action also exist in a succession of like degrees, because every affection has some relation to love, every thought some relation to wisdom, and every action some relation to useful endeavor.<p>Charity, faith and good work exist in a succession of like degrees; for charity is a matter of affection, faith a matter of thought, and good work a matter of action.<p>Will, understanding and practice similarly exist in a succession of like degrees; for will is a matter of love and so of affection, understanding a matter of wisdom and so of faith, and practice a matter of useful endeavor and so of work.<p>As all the qualities of wisdom and love are present in useful endeavor, therefore, so all the qualities of thought and affection are present in action, all the qualities of faith and charity in good work, and so on. But all of these must be homogeneous, that is to say, accordant. </p>

<p>
214. Affection, thought and action are also in a series of like degrees, because all affection has relation to love, thought to wisdom, and action to use. Charity, faith, and good works are in a series of like degrees, for charity is of affection, faith is of thought, and good works of action. Will, understanding, and practice are also in a series of like degrees, for will is of love and hence of affection, understanding is of wisdom and hence of faith, and practice is of use and hence of work. As, therefore, all things of wisdom and love are present in use, so all things of thought and affection are present in action, all things of faith and charity in good works, and so forth. But all these are homogeneous, that is, concordant. </p>

<p>
214. Affection, thought, and action are also in a series of like degrees, because all affection has relation to love, thought to wisdom, and action to use. Charity, faith, and good works are in a series of like degrees, for charity is of affection, faith of thought, and good works of action. Will, understanding, and doing are also in a series of like degrees; for will is of love and so of affection, understanding is of wisdom and so of faith, and doing is of use and so of work; as, then, all things of wisdom and love are present in use, so all things of thought and affection are present in action, all things of faith and charity in good works, and so forth; but all are homogeneous, that is, concordant. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #214 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
214. In serie similium graduum sunt quoque Affectio, Cogitatio et Actio, quia omnis affectio se refert ad amorem, cogitatio ad sapientiam, et actio ad usum. In serie similium graduum sunt charitas, fides, et bonum opus, nam charitas est affectionis, fides est cogitationis, et bonum opus est actionis. In serie similium graduum sunt etiam voluntas, intellectus, et exercitium, nam voluntas est amoris et inde affectionis, intellectus est sapientiae et inde fidei, et exercitium est usus et inde operis. <sup>1</sup>
Sicut itaque usui insunt omnia sapientiae et amoris, ita actioni insunt omnia cogitationis et affectionis, bono operi omnia fidei et charitatis, et sic porro; sed omnia homogenea, hoc est[,] concordantia. <p>
