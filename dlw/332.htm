<h4 align="center"></h4><p>332、完善理性官能的功用，就是在刚才所提到的这些事上提供教导的所有学科，它们被称为科学知识和学科分支。这些涉及自然、经济、社会和道德事务，它们是要么从父母和教师，要么从书本，要么从与他人的交往，要么从在这些学科上的独立思考获得的。这些学科会完善理性官能，甚至达到它们成为更高层级上的功用的程度，它们也能持久，直到被应用于生活的程度。限于篇幅，不再列举这些功用，因为它们种类繁多，并且它们与公共利益的关系各不相同。</p>

332. Useful functions for the development of our rational ability are all the ones that teach us what I have just been talking about. These are called academic disciplines and fields of study having to do with nature, economics, politics, and morals, things that we get from parents and teachers, from books, from our dealings with each other, or from ourselves through our inner reflection about these subjects. These develop our rational ability to the extent that they are higher-level functions, and they become secure to the extent that we apply them to our lives.<p>There is not room to list these useful functions both because there are so many of them and because their relationship to the common good varies. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #332 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
332. Forms of use for perfecting the rational faculty are all disciplines which provide instruction in those matters just mentioned, and which are called sciences and fields of study. These relate to natural, economic, civil, and moral concerns, and they are learned either from parents and teachers, or from books, or from dealings with others, or on one's own through reflections on such concerns.<p>These disciplines perfect the rational faculty to the extent that they are forms of use in a higher degree, and they remain to the extent that they are applied to life.<p>We do not have the space to enumerate these forms of use, both because of their multitude, and because of their varying relation to the common good. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #332 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
332. Uses for perfecting the rational are all the things which teach the subjects already mentioned, and are called knowledges and studies pertaining to natural, economic, civil and moral affairs. These are acquired from parents and teachers, or from books, or from associations with others, or by reflection on these subjects by oneself. These things perfect the rational so far as they are uses in a higher degree and they endure so far as they are applied to life. Space forbids enumeration of these uses, both on account of their abundance, and of their varied relation to the common good. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #332 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
332. Uses for perfecting the rational are all things that give instruction about the subjects above mentioned, and are called sciences and branches of study, pertaining to natural, economical, civil and moral affairs, which are learned either from parents and teachers, or from books, or from interaction with others, or by reflection on these subjects by oneself. These things perfect the rational so far as they are uses in a higher degree, and they are permanent as far as they are applied to life. Space forbids the enumeration of these uses, by reason both of their multitude and of their varied relation to the common good. </p>

332. Usus ad perficiendum Rationale, sunt omnia quae docent illa quae nunc dicta sunt, ac vocantur scientiae et studia, quae se referunt <sup>1</sup>
ad Naturalia, Oeconomica, Civilia, et Moralia, quae vel ex parentibus et magistris, vel ex libris, vel ex commerciis cum aliis, vel ex semet per reflexiones ab illis, hauriuntur. Haec Rationale in tantum perficiunt, quantum in superiori gradu usus sunt, et permanent quantum applicantur vitae. Hos usus enumerare non vacat, tam propter copiam, quam propter varium respectum ad commune bonum. <p>
