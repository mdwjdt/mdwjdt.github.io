83. Angelic Wisdom about Divine Love<p>Part 2<p>In the spiritual world, divine love and wisdom look like a sun. There are two worlds, one spiritual and one physical; and the spiritual world does not derive anything from the physical one, nor does the physical one derive anything from the spiritual one. They are completely distinct from each other, communicating only by means of correspondence, whose nature has been amply explained elsewhere. The following example may be enlightening. Warmth in the physical world is the equivalent of the good that thoughtfulness does in the spiritual world, and light in the physical world is the equivalent of the truth that faith perceives in the spiritual world. No one can fail to see that warmth and the goodness of being thoughtful, and light and the truth of faith, are completely distinct from each other.<p>At first glance, they seem as distinct as two quite different things. That is what comes to the fore when we start thinking about what the goodness of being thoughtful has in common with warmth and what the truth of faith has in common with light. Yet spiritual warmth is that very "goodness," and spiritual light is that very "truth."<p>In spite of the fact that they are so distinct from each other, though, they still make a single whole by means of their correspondence. They are so united that when we read about warmth and light in the Word, the spirits and angels who are with us see thoughtfulness in the place of warmth and faith in the place of light.<p>I include this example to make it clear that the two worlds, the spiritual one and the physical one, are so distinct from each other that they have nothing in common, and that still they have been created in such a way that they communicate with each other and are actually united through their correspondences. </p>

<p>83. PART TWO<p>Divine love and wisdom appear in the spiritual world as the sun. There are two worlds, one spiritual and the other natural, and the spiritual world does not derive any of its character from the natural world, nor the natural world any of its character from the spiritual world. They are completely different worlds, communicating only through correspondent relationships, the nature of which we have shown many times elsewhere.<p>To illustrate this, take the following example. Heat in the natural world corresponds to the good of charity in the spiritual world, and light in the natural world corresponds to the truth of faith in the spiritual world. Who does not see that heat and the good of charity, and that light and the truth of faith, are altogether different in character?<p> </p>
<p>[2] At first sight these appear to be so different as to be two completely disparate entities. That is how they appear if one ponders what the good of charity has in common with heat, or the truth of faith with light - when in fact spiritual heat is that good, and spiritual light is that truth.<p>Even though these are so different in themselves, still they accord by correspondence. They so accord that when a person reads in the Word of heat and light, the spirits and angels who are with the person then perceive, instead of heat, charity, and instead of light, faith.<p>We have cited this example to show that the two worlds, spiritual and natural, are so different that they have nothing in common with each other, and yet have been so created that they communicate - indeed, are conjoined - through correspondent relationships. </p>

<p>83. PART II. THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM APPEAR IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AS A SUN <p>There are two worlds, the spiritual and the natural. And the spiritual world does not derive anything from the natural world, nor the natural world from the spiritual world. They are quite distinct, communicating only by correspondences, the nature of which has been shown elsewhere in many places. To illustrate this, take the following example. Heat in the natural world corresponds to the good of charity in the spiritual world, and light (lux) in the natural world corresponds to the truth of faith in the spiritual world. Who cannot see that heat and the good of charity, and light and the truth of faith are quite distinct? At first glance they appear so distinct as to be two completely diverse things. They so appear if it is considered what the good of charity has in common with heat, and what the truth of faith has in common with light, when yet spiritual heat is that good and spiritual light is that truth. Although these are thus distinct in themselves, yet they make one by means of correspondence. They make one in such a way that when a man reads in the Word "heat and light," then spirits and angels who are with the man perceive, instead of heat, charity, and instead of light, faith. This example is adduced that it may be known that the two worlds, the spiritual and the natural, are so distinct that they have nothing in common with each other. But they have been created in such a way that they may communicate, indeed may be conjoined by means of correspondences. </p>

83. PART SECOND. <p>DIVINE LOVE AND DIVINE WISDOM APPEAR IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AS A SUN. <p>There are two worlds, the spiritual and the natural. The spiritual world does not draw anything from the natural, nor the natural world from the spiritual. The two are totally distinct, and communicate only by correspondences, the nature of which has been abundantly shown elsewhere. To illustrate this by an example: heat in the natural world corresponds to the good of charity in the spiritual world, and light in the natural world corresponds to the truth of faith in the spiritual world; and who does not see that heat and the good of charity, and that light and the truth of faith, are wholly distinct? At first sight they appear as distinct as two entirely different things. They so appear when one inquires what the good of charity has in common with heat, or the truth of faith with light; when in fact, spiritual heat is that good, and spiritual light is that truth. Although these things are in themselves so distinct, they make one by correspondence. They make one in this way: when man reads, in the Word, of heat and light, the spirits and angels who are with the man perceive charity instead of heat, and faith instead of light. This example is adduced, in order that it may be known that the two worlds, the spiritual and the natural, are so distinct as to have nothing in common with each other; yet are so created as to have communication, yea, conjunction by means of correspondences. </p>

<p>83. SAPIENTIA ANGELICA <p>DE <p>DIVINO AMORE <p>[ET DE <p>DIVINA SAPIENTIA] <p>------------ <p>PARS SECUNDA <p>QUOD DIVINUS AMOR ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA APPAREANT IN MUNDO SPIRITUALI UT SOL. Sunt duo Mundi, Spiritualis et Naturalis; et Mundus spiritualis non trahit quicquam ex Mundo naturali, nec Mundus naturalis ex Mundo spirituali; sunt prorsus distincti; communicant solum per Correspondentias, quae quales sunt, alibi multis ostensum est: ad hoc illustrandum, sit hoc exemplum: Calor in Mundo naturali correspondet bono charitatis in Mundo spirituali, ac Lux in Mundo naturali correspondet vero fidei in Mundo spirituali; quod calor et bonum charitatis, ac lux et verum fidei prorsus distincta sint, quis non videt.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Ex prima intuitione apparent illa ita distincta, sicut duo prorsus diversa; ita apparent si cogitatur, quid commune habet bonum charitatis cum calore, et quid verum fidei cum luce, cum tamen Calor spiritualis est illud bonum, et Lux spiritualis est illud verum. Haec tametsi ita distincta in se sunt, usque unum faciunt per correspondentiam; unum faciunt ita, ut dum homo in Verbo legit Calorem et Lucem, tunc Spiritus et Angeli, qui apud hominem sunt, pro calore percipiant <sup>1</sup>
charitatem, et pro luce fidem. Hoc exemplum adductum est, ut sciatur, quod duo Mundi, Spiritualis et Naturalis, ita distincti sint, ut inter se nihil commune habeant; sed usque ita creati ut communicent, imo conjungantur, per correspondentias. <p>
