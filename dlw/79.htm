<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第79节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>79、神性在最大和最小事物上是一样的，这一点可通过天堂和那里的天使来说明。整个天堂中的神性和一位天使中的神性是一样的；因此，甚至整个天堂看似一位天使。教会和教会的一个成员也是如此。神性的最大接受容器是整个天堂连同整个教会；最小接受容器是一位天堂天使或一个教会之人。有时，天堂的整个一个社群向我显为一位天使人；我被告知，它既可显为如巨人那样大的人，也可显为如婴孩那样小的人；这是因为神性在最大和最小事物上是一样的。</p>

<p>
79. We may also use heaven and an individual angel to illustrate the fact that Divinity is the same in the largest and smallest things. Divinity in the whole heaven and Divinity in an individual angel is the same. This is why all heaven can be seen as a single angel.<p>The same holds true for the church and for the individual member of it. The largest entity in which Divinity is present is all of heaven and the whole church together; the smallest is an individual angel or an individual member of the church. On occasion I have seen a whole heavenly community as a single angelic person, and I have been told that this may look like an immense, gigantic individual or like a little, childlike one. This is because Divinity is the same in the largest and smallest things. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #79 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
79. That the Divine is the same in the greatest and least of things can be illustrated by the example of heaven and an angel there. The Divine throughout the whole of heaven and the Divine in an angel is the same. Therefore the whole of heaven can also appear as a single angel.<p>It is the same with the church and a member of it. The greatest recipient vessel in which the Divine dwells is heaven as a whole and at the same the church as a whole. The smallest recipient vessel is the angel of heaven or the person of the church.<p>Several times I have seen an entire society of heaven appearing as a single angelic person; and I have been told that it could appear as a person as great as a giant, or as one as small as a little child - and this because the Divine is the same in the greatest and least of things. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #79 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
79. It can be shown from heaven and from an angel there that the Divine is the same in greatest and least things. The Divine in the whole heaven and the Divine in an angel is the same; wherefore even the whole heaven may appear as one Angel. It is the same with the Church and with a man of the Church. The greatest in which the Divine is, is the whole heaven and at the same time the whole Church; the least is an angel of heaven and a man of the Church. Several times an entire society of heaven has appeared to me as one angel-man. And it was said that it may appear like a man as big as a giant, or as a man as small as a little child, and this because the Divine is the same in greatest and in least things. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #79 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
79. That the Divine is the same in things greatest and least, may be shown by means of heaven and by means of an angel there. The Divine in the whole heaven and the Divine in an angel is the same; therefore even the whole heaven may appear as one angel. So is it with the church, and with a man of the church. The greatest form receptive of the Divine is the whole heaven together with the whole church; the least is an angel of heaven and a man of the church. Sometimes an entire society of heaven has appeared to me as one angel-man; and it was told that it may appear like a man as large as a giant, or like a man as small as an infant; and this, because the Divine in things greatest and least is the same. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #79 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
79. Quod Divinum sit idem in maximis et in minimis, illustrari potest ex Coelo et ex Angelo ibi; Divinum in toto Coelo et Divinum in angelo est idem; quare etiam totum Coelum apparere potest ut unus Angelus. Simile est cum Ecclesia, et cum homine ejus: maximum in quo est Divinum, est totum Coelum et simul tota Ecclesia; minimum est angelus coeli et homo ecclesiae. Aliquoties apparuit mihi integra societas coeli sicut unus homo angelus; et dictum quod apparere possit sicut homo magnus ut gigas, et sicut homo parvus ut infans: et hoc quia Divinum est idem in maximis et in minimis. </p>
