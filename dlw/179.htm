<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">3.2 爱与智慧有层级之分，因而热、光、大气也有层级之分</h4><p>179、若不知道层级的存在，以及何为层级，其性质如何，接下来的内容无法理解，因为一切受造物，因而一切形式里面都有层级的存在。因此，有关天使智慧的这一部分将论述层级。从存在三层天堂天使的事实清楚可知，爱与智慧有层级之分。在爱与智慧方面，第三层天堂的天使远胜第二层天堂的天使，第二层天堂的天使又远胜最低层天堂的天使，以致他们不能在一起。爱与智慧的层级将他们区别并分开。正因如此，最低层天堂的天使无法上升到高层天堂的天使那里，即便被允许上去，也看不见他们周围的高层天使或任何事物。他们之所以看不见，是因为高层天使的爱与智慧处于更高层级，超出低层天使的理解范畴。事实上，每位天使都是自己的爱和自己的智慧，爱连同智慧在其形式上就是人，因为神作为爱本身和智慧本身，就是一个人。<br><br>有时，我被恩准看见最低层天堂的天使上到第三层天堂的天使那里；当他们向那里一路爬上去时，我听他们抱怨说，他们没有看见任何人，其实他们一直在高层天使中间。后来他们得到指教：这些天使不为他们所见，是因为他们感觉不到这些天使的爱与智慧，正是天使的爱与智慧使他显为一个人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #179 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
179. There are levels of love and wisdom, consequent levels of warmth and light, and also levels of atmosphere. Without a knowledge that there are levels, what they are and what they are like, what is to follow will be incomprehensible, since there are levels in everything that has been created; therefore they exist in every form. Consequently, I need to discuss levels in this part of Angelic Wisdom.<p>We can tell clearly from the angels of the three heavens that there are levels of love and wisdom. Angels of the third heaven so surpass angels of the second heaven in love and wisdom, and these in turn so surpass angels of the farthest heaven, that they cannot live in the same place. Their levels of love and wisdom mark them off and separate them. This is why angels of the lower heavens cannot climb up to angels of the higher heavens, and why if they are allowed to climb up they do not see anyone or anything around them. The reason they do not see anyone is that the love and wisdom of the higher angels is on a higher level, a level beyond their perception. Every angel actually is her or his love and wisdom; and love together with wisdom is human in form because God, who is love itself and wisdom itself, is human.<p>Occasionally I have been allowed to see angels of the farthest heaven go up to angels of the third heaven. When they managed to get there, I heard them complain that they could not see anyone; and yet they were surrounded by angels. They were afterwards told that these angels had been invisible to them because they could not perceive their love and wisdom, and it is love and wisdom that give angels their human appearance. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #179 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>179. There are degrees of love and wisdom, and therefore degrees of heat and light, and so, too, degrees of atmospheres. Unless one is aware of the existence of degrees, and of what they are and their nature, the following observations cannot be comprehended, since there are degrees in every created thing, thus in every form. Therefore in this third part of Divine Love and Wisdom we must take up degrees.<p>That there are degrees of love and wisdom can be plainly seen from the love and wisdom of the angels of the three heavens. Angels of the third heaven excel angels of the second heaven in their love and wisdom, and these in turn excel angels of the lowest heaven, and this to such an extent that they cannot dwell together. The degrees of their love and wisdom distinguish them and separate them.<p>So it is that angels of the lower heavens cannot ascend to angels of the higher heavens, and if it is granted them to ascend, they do not then see those higher angels, nor anything of their surroundings. The reason they do not see them is that the love and wisdom of those higher angels is in a higher degree, which transcends their perception. For every angel is an embodiment of his love and wisdom, and love together with wisdom is in its form the human being, because God, who is love itself and wisdom itself, is a human God.<p> </p>
<p>[2] I have been granted several times to see angels of the lowest heaven ascend to angels of the third heaven, and when they had worked their way up there, I heard them complain that they did not see anyone, even though they were surrounded by those higher angels. They were afterward then informed that the higher angels were invisible to them because they were incapable of perceiving those angels' love and wisdom, and that it is an angel's love and wisdom that cause him to be seen as a person. </p>

<p>179. THERE ARE DEGREES OF LOVE AND WISDOM, AND HENCE DEGREES OF HEAT AND LIGHT, ALSO DEGREES OF ATMOSPHERES <p>Unless it is known that there are degrees, what they are, and what their nature is, the things that follow cannot be comprehended, since in every created thing, thus in every form, there are degrees. Wherefore in this Part of THE ANGELIC WISDOM degrees will be treated. That there are degrees of love and wisdom, can be clearly established from the angels of the three heavens. The angels of the third heaven so far surpass the angels of the second heaven in love and wisdom, and these, the angels of the lowest heaven, that they cannot be together. The degrees of love and wisdom distinguish and separate them. Hence it is that angels of the lower heavens cannot ascend to angels of higher heavens; and if they are allowed to ascend, then they do not see them nor anything that is about them. They do not see them because the love and wisdom of the higher angels is in a higher degree, and this transcends perception. For each angel is his own love and wisdom, and love together with wisdom is in its form a man, because God Who is Love itself and Wisdom itself, is a Man. It has sometimes been granted me to see that angels of the lowest heaven ascended to angels of the third heaven; and when they had made their way thither, I have heard them complaining that they did not see anyone, and yet they were in the midst of those angels. Afterwards they were instructed that the angels were invisible to them because their love and wisdom were imperceptible to them, and that love and wisdom are what make an angel appear as a man. </p>

179. THERE ARE DEGREES OF LOVE AND WISDOM, CONSEQUENTLY DEGREES OF HEAT AND LIGHT ALSO DEGREES, OF ATMOSPHERES. <p>The things which follow cannot be comprehended unless it be known that there are degrees, also what they are, and what their nature is, because in every created thing, thus in every form, there are degrees. This Part of Angelic Wisdom will therefore treat of degrees. That there are degrees of love and wisdom can be clearly seen from the fact that there are angels of the three heavens. The angels of the third heaven so far excel the angels of the second heaven in love and wisdom, and these, the angels of the lowest heaven, that they cannot be together. The degrees of love and wisdom distinguish and separate them. It is from this that angels of the lower heavens cannot ascend to angels of higher heavens, or if allowed to ascend, they do not see the higher angels or anything that is about them. They do not see them because the love and wisdom of the higher angels is of a higher degree, transcending the perception of the lower angels. For each angel is his own love and his own wisdom; and love together with wisdom in its form is a man, because God, who is Love itself and Wisdom itself, is a Man. It has sometimes been permitted me to see angels of the lowest heaven who have ascended to the angels of the third heaven; and when they had made their way thither, I have heard them complaining that they did not see any one, and all the while they were in the midst of the higher angels. Afterwards they were instructed that those angels were invisible to them because their love and wisdom were imperceptible to them, and that love and wisdom are what make an angel appear as a man. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #179 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>179. QUOD GRADUS AMORIS ET SAPIENTIAE SINT, ET INDE GRADUS CALORIS ET LUCIS, TUM GRADUS ATHMOSPHAERARUM. Nisi sciatur quod Gradus sint, tum quid sunt, et quales, non comprehendi possunt sequentia, quoniam in omni re creata sunt gradus, ita in omni forma; quare in hac PARTE SAPIENTIAE ANGELICAE de Gradibus agetur. Quod Gradus amoris et sapientiae sint, manifeste constare potest ex Angelis trium coelorum; Angeli Tertii Coeli excellunt <sup>1</sup>
amore et sapientia prae Angelis Secundi Coeli, et hi prae Angelis Ultimi Coeli, in tantum, ut non possint simul esse; gradus amoris et sapientiae distinguunt <sup>2</sup>
et separant illos: inde est, quod Angeli inferiorum coelorum non ascendere possint ad Angelos superiorum coelorum, et si illis datur ut ascendant, tunc non vident illos, nec aliquid quod est apud illos: causa quod non videant illos, est quia amor et sapientia illorum est in superiori gradu, qui perceptionem transcendit: unusquisque enim Angelus est suus amor et sua sapientia, ac amor una cum sapientia est in sua forma homo, quia Deus, qui est Ipse Amor et Ipsa Sapientia, <sup>3</sup>
est Homo.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Datum est mihi aliquoties videre, quod Angeli Ultimi Coeli ascenderint ad Angelos Tertii Coeli, et cum illuc enisi sunt, audivi illos conquestos, quod non videant aliquem, et usque erant in medio illorum; et postea instructi sunt, quod illis inconspicui fuerint, quia amor et sapientia eorum imperceptibiles illis essent, et quod amor et sapientia faciant ut Angelus appareat ut homo. <p>
