<h4 align="center"></h4><p>225、有这两种层级在里面的最大事物就是完整的宇宙、完整的自然界和完整的灵界；完整的一切帝国和王国；以及完整的这些的一切文明、道德和属灵元素；整个动物界，整个植物界和整个矿物界，各自都是完整的；这两个世界合起来的一切大气，以及它们的热和光。这些事物还包括不那么总体的事物，如完整的人；完整的每个动物，完整的每棵树和每棵灌木；以及完整的每块石头和每块金属。这些事物的形式在这一点上是一样的：它们都由这两种层级构成。原因在于，创造它们的神性在最大和最小事物上是一样的(如77-82节所示)。所有这些事物的具体成分和最基本成分，在这一点上就像总体和最大的总体：它们都是这两种层级的形式。</p>

225. The largest things that involve levels of both kinds include the universe in all its fullness and the physical world in all its fullness. They include the spiritual world in its fullness, every empire and every monarchy in its fullness and their every moral and spiritual feature in its fullness, the whole animal kingdom, the whole plant kingdom, and the whole mineral kingdom, each in all its fullness. Then there are the atmospheres of each world taken as a whole, and their forms of warmth and light. The same holds for less inclusive entities, such as ourselves in our fullness, every animal in its fullness, every tree and shrub in its fullness, even every stone and metal in its fullness.<p>Their forms are similar in this respect, namely that they are made up of levels of both kinds. This is because the Divinity by which they were created is the same in the largest and smallest things, as noted above in <a href="77.htm" target=_top>77-82</a>. All their details, no matter how minute, resemble their shared aspects--no matter how widely shared those aspects are among them--in being forms made up of levels of both kinds. </p>

225. The grandest entities that have in them degrees of both kinds are the universe in its entirety, the natural world in its entirety, and the spiritual world in its entirety; every empire and every kingdom in its entirety; every civil, every moral and every spiritual element of these in its entirety; the whole animal kingdom, the whole plant kingdom, and the whole mineral kingdom, each in its entirety; and all the atmospheres of both worlds taken together, with their forms of heat and light.<p>These entities include as well ones less general, such as the human being in his entirety, every animal in its entirety, every tree and every bush in its entirety, and every stone and every metal in its entirety.<p>The forms of these are alike in the fact that they consist of degrees of both kinds. That is because the Divine by whom they were created, in the greatest and least of things is the same, as we demonstrated above in nos. <a href="77.htm">77-82</a>.<p>The particular and most elemental constituents of all these entities are like the general and most universal ones in the fact that they are forms composed of degrees of both kinds. </p>

<p>
225. The greatest things in which there are degrees of both kinds, are the universe in its whole complex, the natural world in its complex, and the spiritual world in its complex, every empire and every kingdom in its complex, every thing civil, moral and spiritual of these in their complex, the whole animal kingdom, the whole vegetable kingdom, and the whole mineral kingdom, each in its complex, all atmospheres of both worlds taken together, as well as their heats and lights. Likewise, things less general, as man in his complex, every animal in its complex, every tree and every shrub in its complex, besides every stone and every metal in its complex. The forms of these are alike in this, that they consist of degrees of both kinds. The reason is that the Divine by which they were created is the same in greatest and in least things (as was shown above,<a href="77.htm">77-82</a>). The singulars and the veriest singulars are like generals and veriest generals in this that they are forms of both kinds of degrees. </p>

225. The greatest things in which there are degrees of both kinds, are the universe in its whole complex, the natural world in its complex, and the spiritual world in its complex; every empire and every kingdom in its complex; also, all civil, moral and spiritual concerns of these in their complex; the whole animal kingdom, the whole vegetable kingdom, and the whole mineral kingdom, each in its complex; all atmospheres of both worlds taken together, also their heats and lights. Likewise things less general, as man in his complex; every animal in its complex, every tree and every shrub in its complex; as also every stone and every metal in its complex. The forms of these are alike in this, that they consist of degrees of both kinds; the reason is that the Divine, by which they were created, is the same in things greatest and least (as was shown above, n. <a href="77.htm" target=_top>77-82</a>). The particulars and the veriest particulars of all these are like generals and the largest generals in this, that they are forms of both kinds of degrees. </p>

225. Maxima, in quibus utriusque generis gradus sunt, est universum in <sup>1</sup>
toto suo complexu; est Mundus naturalis in suo complexu; estque Mundus spiritualis in suo; est quodvis Imperium, et quodvis Regnum <sup>2</sup>
in suo complexu; est omne civile, omne morale et omne spirituale eorum, in suo complexu; totum Regnum animale, totum Regnum vegetabile, et totum Regnum minerale, quodlibet in suo complexu; sunt omnes Athmosphaerae utriusque Mundi <sup>3</sup>
simul sumtae, tum calores et luces earum. Pariter minus communia, ut homo in suo complexu, omne animal in suo, omnis arbor et omne virgultum in suo, tum omnis lapis et omne metallum in suo. Horum formae sunt similes quoad id, quod ex utriusque generis gradibus consistant: causa est, quia Divinum, a quo creata sunt, in maximis et minimis est idem, ut supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_225/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_77" target=_top>77-82</a> demonstratum est. Horum omnium singularia et singularissima sunt communibus et communissimis similia in eo, quod sint formae utriusque generis graduum. <sup>4</sup>
