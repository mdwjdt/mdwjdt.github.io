<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第五部分</h4><h4 align="center">5.1 主在人里面为自己创造并形成了两个容器和居所，被称为意愿和理解力；意愿是为神性之爱，理解力是为神性智慧</h4><p>358、前面论述了神造物主，也就是永恒主的神性之爱和神性智慧，以及宇宙的创造。现在必须谈谈人类的创造。我们读到，人是“照着神的形像，按着祂的样式”被造的(创世记1:26)。此处“神的形像”表示祂的神性智慧，“神的样式”表示祂的神性之爱。智慧就是爱的形像，因为爱在智慧中显示它自己，以便被看见和认识；正因爱在智慧中被看见和认识，所以智慧是爱的一个形像。此外，爱是生命的本质，智慧是源于爱的生命的表达。神的样式和形像在天使身上是显而易见的，因为爱在他们脸上从里面发光，智慧在他们的美丽中发光，他们的美丽是他们的爱的外在表达或形式。我已看见并知道了。</p>

358. Angelic Wisdom about Divine Love<p>Part 5<p>The Lord has created and formed within us two vessels and dwellings for himself called volition and discernment. Volition is for his divine love and discernment for his divine wisdom. I have already discussed the divine love and wisdom of God the Creator, who is the Lord from eternity, and I have discussed the creation of the universe. Now I need to say something about our own creation.<p>We read that we were created in the image of God and according to his likeness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_1_26.htm" target=_top>Genesis 1:26</a>). In this passage "the image of God" means divine wisdom and "the likeness of God" means divine love, since wisdom is nothing more than the image of love. Love actually presents itself to view and to recognition in wisdom, and since that is where we see and recognize it, wisdom is its image. Then too, love is the reality of life and wisdom is its consequent manifestation. This "image and likeness" of God is strikingly visible in angels. Love shining from within is their faces and wisdom in their beauty, with beauty as the form of their love. I have seen this, and I have come to know it. </p>

358. PART FIVE<p>The Lord created and formed in mankind two recipient vessels and abodes for Himself, called will and intellect, the will for His Divine love, and the intellect for His Divine wisdom. We have discussed the Divine love and Divine wisdom of God the Creator, who is the Lord from eternity. We have discussed as well the creation of the universe. Now we must say something about the creation of mankind.<p>We read that man was created in the image of God, according to His likeness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_1_26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>). By the image of God there is meant His Divine wisdom, and by the likeness of God His Divine love. For wisdom is nothing else than the image of love, since love presents itself to be seen and recognized in wisdom; and because it is seen and recognized in wisdom, wisdom is an image of it. Love is moreover the essence of life, and wisdom the expression of life springing from it.<p>A likeness and image of God is clearly apparent in angels, for love shines from within in their faces, and wisdom in their beauty, beauty being the outward expression of their love. I have seen it and recognized it. </p>

358. PART V <p>TWO RECEPTACLES AND DWELLINGS OF HIS OWN, CALLED WILL AND UNDERSTANDING, HAVE BEEN CREATED AND FORMED BY THE LORD IN MAN; THE WILL FOR HIS DIVINE LOVE, AND THE UNDERSTANDING FOR HIS DIVINE WISDOM <p>The Divine Love and Wisdom of God the Creator, Who is the Lord from eternity, and the creation of the universe, have been treated of, something shall now be said of the creation of man. We read that man was created in the image of God after His likeness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_1_26.htm">Gen. 1:26</a>). By "the image of God" is there meant the Divine Wisdom, and by "the likeness of God" the Divine Love; for wisdom is nothing else than an image of love, since love shows itself in order to be seen and recognized in wisdom; and because it is there seen and recognized, wisdom is its image. Moreover love is the Esse of life, and Wisdom is the Existere of life therefrom. The likeness and image of God appear clearly in angels, for love from within shines forth in their faces, and wisdom in their beauty; and beauty is the form of their love. I have seen and perceived it. </p>

358. PART FIFTH. <p>TWO RECEPTACLES AND ABODES FOR HIMSELF, CALLED WILL AND UNDERSTANDING, HAVE BEEN CREATED AND FORMED BY THE LORD IN MAN; THE WILL FOR HIS DIVINE LOVE, AND THE UNDERSTANDING FOR HIS DIVINE WISDOM. <p>The Divine Love and Divine Wisdom of God the Creator, who is the Lord from eternity, and also the creation of the universe, have been treated of; something shall now be said of the creation of man. We read (in Gen. 1:26) that man was created "in the image of God, after His likeness." B <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_1_26.htm" target=_top>(Genesis 1:26)</a> y "image of God" is there meant the Divine Wisdom, and by "likeness" of God the Divine Love; since wisdom is nothing but an image of love, for in wisdom love presents itself to be seen and recognized, and because it is seen and recognized in wisdom, wisdom is an image of it. Moreover love is the esse of life, and wisdom is the existere of life therefrom. In angels the likeness and image of God clearly appear, since love from within shines forth in their faces, and wisdom in their beauty, and their beauty is a form of their love. I have seen and know. </p>

358. SAPIENTIA ANGELICA <p>DE <p>DIVINO AMORE <p>[ET DE <p>DIVINA SAPIENTIA] <p>------------ <p>PARS QUINTA <p>QUOD A DOMINO APUD HOMINEM CREATA ET FORMATA SINT DUO RECEPTACULA ET HABITACULA IPSIUS, QUAE VOCANTUR VOLUNTAS ET INTELLECTUS, VOLUNTAS PRO DIVINO AMORE IPSIUS, ET INTELLECTUS PRO DIVINA SAPIENTIA IPSIUS. Actum est de Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia Dei Creatoris, qui est Dominus ab aeterno; et de Creatione Universi; nunc aliquid dicetur de Creatione hominis. Legitur quod Homo creatus sit in imaginem Dei secundum similitudinem Ipsius, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_358/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_1_26" target=_top>Genesis 1:26</a>; per imaginem Dei ibi intelligitur Divina Sapientia, et per similitudinem Dei Divinus Amor, nam Sapientia non aliud est quam imago amoris, sistit enim amor se videndum et cognoscendum in sapientia, et quia ibi videtur et cognoscitur, est sapientia imago ejus; amor etiam est Esse vitae, et sapientia est Existere vitae ex illo: similitudo et imago Dei apparet perspicue apud angelos, elucet enim amor ab interiori in facie illorum, et sapientia in pulchritudine, et pulchritudo est forma amoris illorum: vidi et cognovi. </p>
