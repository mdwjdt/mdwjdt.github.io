<h4 align="center"></h4><p>403、(5)爱或意愿也在其人类形式中预备一切，以便它可以与智慧或理解力联合行动。我们说的是意愿和理解力，但要牢记在心是：意愿才是一个人的全部，因为意愿和理解力在脑里面存在于它的最初成分中，在身体里面存在于它的衍生成分中，并如此存在于整体和每个部分中(参看365-367节)。<br><br>由此可见，就人的本质形式，无论总体形式还是各部分的具体形式而言，意愿就是他的全部；理解力则是它的配偶，就像肺是心的配偶一样。要当心，不要怀有这种观念：意愿是与人类形式分离的某种事物，因为意愿正是这种形式。由此不仅可以看出意愿如何为理解力预备洞房，还可以看出它如何在自己的家，也就是整个身体中预备一切，以便它可以与理解力联合行动。它的预备方式是这样：身体的每一个组成部分怎样与意愿结合，就怎样与理解力结合；换句话说，身体的每一个组成部分怎样顺从意愿，就怎样顺从理解力。<br><br>至于身体的每一个组成部分如何预备与理解力结合，如同与意愿结合一样，这只能借助解剖学知识在身体里，如同在一面镜子或形像中那样看出来。我们从解剖学知道身体的所有组成部分是如何联系在一起，以至于当肺呼吸时，整个身体的每一个部分都在心脏跳动的同时被肺呼吸激活。我们从解剖学知道，心脏通过心房(和右心室)与肺相连，它们继续延伸到肺的内部成分。我们还知道，整个身体的内脏都通过韧带与胸腔相连，并且如此相连，以至于当肺呼吸时，一切事物，无论整体上还是分别地，都在某种程度上参与呼吸运动。因为当肺扩张时，肋骨会扩张胸腔，胸膜张开，横隔膜拉宽，同时通过从这些部分延伸出来的韧带而与它们相连的身体所有下部器官，与它们一起通过肺的作用而获得某种动作，更不用说其它许多现象了，免得不懂解剖学的读者因不熟悉这门学科的术语而在这个问题上陷入混乱。只需咨询一下专业精通的解剖学家，整个身体的所有组成部分是不是从胸部往下如此相连，以至于当肺通过呼吸扩张时，它们当中的每一个都被搅进与肺动作同步的一个动作中。<br><br>这一切清楚表明，意愿所预备的理解力与人类形式的每一个组成部分之间的结合是何性质。仅仅调查这些联系，以解剖学家的眼光审视它们，然后按照这些联系观察它们与肺呼吸和心脏的合作，最后在思维上用理解力替代肺，用意愿替代心，你就会明白。</p>

403, 5. Love or volition also prepares everything in its human form so that it can act in unison with wisdom or discernment. I am talking about volition and discernment, but it needs to be absolutely clear that volition is the whole person. Actually, volition is found with discernment in primary forms in the brain and in derivative forms in the body, so (as explained in <a href="365.htm" target=_top>365</a>, <a href="366.htm" target=_top>366</a>, and <a href="367.htm" target=_top>367</a> above) it is found in the whole body and in every part. We can tell from this that volition is the whole person in respect both to overall form and to the particular form of every part. We can tell also that discernment is its partner just as the lungs are the partner of the heart.<p>People need to guard against entertaining any notion of volition as something apart from the human form: the two are the same.<p>We can see from this not only how volition prepares a room for discernment but also how it prepares everything in its home, the whole body, so that it can act in unison with discernment. The preparation is like this. The whole body and all its parts are united to discernment just as they are united to volition; or just as the whole body and all its parts are subject to volition, they are subject to discernment.<p>As for how the whole body and all its parts are prepared for a union with discernment like that with volition, this can be seen only as it is reflected or imaged by the science of anatomy in the body. This shows how everything in the body is so connected that when the lungs breathe, the whole body and every part of it is moved by the lungs' breathing just as by the heart's beating. We learn from anatomy that the heart is united to the lungs by its auricles and that these extend into the recesses of the lungs. We learn also that all the viscera of the whole body are connected to the chest cavity by ligaments--so closely connected that when the lungs breathe, the whole body and everything in it, together and individually, receive an impulse from the breathing. When the lungs swell, then the ribs expand the chest, the pleura dilates, and the diaphragm is stretched; and along with them all the lower parts of the body, which are connected to them by ligaments, receive some impulse from the motion of the lungs. Let me say no more, or people who lack anatomical knowledge will find themselves confused because of their unfamiliarity with the terminology of this discipline. Just ask people who are experienced and skilled in anatomy whether everything in the whole body, from the chest on down, is not so tied together that when the lungs swell during breathing, the whole body and everything in it is stirred into motion in time with the lungs.<p>This enables us to see what kind of union volition prepares for discernment, union with the whole human form and everything it comprises. Just search out the connections and examine them with the eye of the anatomist, and then look at their coordination with the breathing lungs and with the heart in the light of those connections. Then think "discernment" for "lungs" and "volition" for "heart," and you will see. </p>

<p>403. (5) Love or the will prepares all else in its human form in order to be able to operate conjointly with wisdom or the intellect. We say, the will and intellect, but it should be rightly known that the will is the totality of a person, for the will exists with the intellect in its first elements in the brain, and in its derivative elements in the body, and so is present in the whole and in every part, as we showed above in nos. <a href="365.htm">365-367</a>. It can be seen from this that the will is the totality of a person as regards his essential form, both as regards his general form and as regards the particular form of all his constituents, and that the intellect is its companion, as the lungs are of the heart.<p>Let everyone take care not to harbor an idea of the will as something separate from the human form, for it is that very form.<p>It can be seen from this, not only how the will prepares a bridal chamber for the intellect, but also how it prepares all else in its home, which is the entire body, in order to be able to operate conjointly with the intellect. It prepares it in such a manner that each and every constituent of the body is joined to the intellect as it is joined to the will, or so that each and every constituent of the body is responsive to the intellect as it is responsive to the will.<p> </p>
<p>[2] How each and every constituent of the body is prepared for conjunction with the intellect as with the will cannot be seen except as in a mirror or image in the body through the study of anatomy. Through that study we know how all the components in the body are connected, so that when the lungs breathe, each and every constituent throughout the entire body is actuated at the same time as by the beating of the heart.<p>From the study of anatomy we know that the heart is joined to the lungs through the atria [and right ventricle], <sup>1</sup>
and that continuations of these extend into the inner constituents of the lungs. We know, too, that the viscera of the entire body are all connected with the chest cavity by ligaments, and so connected that when the lungs breathe, each and every one, as a whole and individually, have transmitted to them some measure of the respiratory motion. For when the lungs inflate, the ribs then expand the chest, the pleura broadens, and the diaphragm is distended, and at the same time all the lower organs of the body, which are connected by ligaments extending from them, have transmitted to them by the action of the lungs some measure of the action - not to mention many other occurrences, lest readers who do not possess a knowledge of anatomy, owing to their unfamiliarity with the terminology of that science, come into a state of confusion regarding this subject. Simply consult people knowledgeable and expert in anatomy as to whether all the constituents in the entire body are not so connected from the breast on down that when the lungs inflate during respiration, each and every one is stirred into a motion synchronous with that of the lungs.<p> </p>
<p>[3] This now makes apparent the nature of the conjunction of the intellect prepared by the will with each and every constituent of the human form. Simply investigate the connections and examine them with an anatomist's eye, and following the connections observe then their concomitant operation with the breathing of the lungs and with the heart, and afterward substitute in thought the intellect for the lungs, and the will for the heart, and you will see.<p>

1.&nbsp;In the mature heart, blood from the veins enters from the right atrium into the right ventricle, is pumped to the lungs, and returning from there to the left atrium, enters the left ventricle and is pumped through the aorta into the body. In the fetal heart, the venous blood passes from the right atrium through an opening called the foramen ovale into the left atrium and so into the left ventricle, bypassing the right ventricle. </p>

<p>403. (v) Love or the will also prepares all the things in its own human form so that it may act together with wisdom or the understanding. Will and understanding are mentioned, but it is right that it should be known that the will is the whole man; for the will is, with the understanding, in first principles in the brains and in derivatives in the body, and thence in the whole and in its every part as has been shown above (<a href="365.htm">365-367</a>). From which it can be established that the will is the whole man as to form itself, both the general and the particular form of all things thereof; and that the understanding is its partner, just as the lungs are the partner of the heart. Let everyone beware of entertaining the idea that the will is something separate from the human form, for it is the same. From this it can be seen not only how the will prepares a bed-chamber for the understanding, but also how it prepares all things in its home, the whole body, so that it may act in union with the understanding. This it makes ready in this way; each and all things of the body are united to the understanding as they are to the will, or the understanding has each and all things of the body in subjection as the will has. How this preparation is effected can be seen in the body, as in a mirror or likeness, by means of the science of anatomy. Thus it is known how all things in the body are connected so that when the lungs breathe, each and all things of the whole body are moved thereby, while at the same time also they are moved by the beating of the heart. It is known from anatomy that the heart is united to the lungs by auricles, which are continued into the interiors of the lungs; again that all the viscera of the whole body are joined to the cavity of the chest by means of ligaments; and so joined that when the lungs breathe, each and all things in general and in detail receive something from the respiratory motion. For when the lungs swell out, the ribs expand the thorax, the pleura IS dilated, and the diaphragm is stretched wide, and together with these all the lower parts of the body connected with them by ligaments receive some movement through the action of the lungs. I do not mention many facts lest those who have no anatomical knowledge become lost through ignorance of the scientific terms employed on this subject. Only consult the expert and discerning anatomists as to whether all things in the whole body from the breast downwards are not so bound together that, when the lungs are inflated, each and all things are roused to action, synchronizing with the action of the lungs. From these things the nature of the union of the understanding with each and all things of the human form, prepared by the will, is now plain; but examine the connections well, and survey them with anatomical eye, and afterwards, according to the connections, observe their co-operation with the breathing lungs and with the heart, and then think of understanding in place of lungs, and of will instead of heart, and you will see. </p>

403. (5) Love or the will prepares all things in its own human form, that it may act conjointly with wisdom or the understanding. We say, will and understanding, but it is to be carefully borne in mind that the will is the entire man; for it is the will that, with the understanding, is in first principles in the brains, and in derivatives in the body, consequently in the whole and in every part (see above, n. <a href="365.htm" target=_top>365-367</a>). From this it can be seen that the will is the entire man as regards his very form, both the general form and the particular form of all parts; and that the understanding is its partner, as the lungs are the partner of the heart. Beware of cherishing an idea of the will as something separate from the human form, for it is that same form. From this it can be seen not only how the will prepares a bridal chamber for the understanding, but also how it prepares all things in its house (which is the whole body) that it may act conjointly with the understanding. This it prepares in such a way that as each and every thing of the body is conjoined to the will, so is it conjoined to the understanding; in other words, that as each and everything of the body is submissive to the will, so is it submissive to the understanding. How each and every thing of the body is prepared for conjunction with the understanding as well as with the will, can be seen in the body only as in a mirror or image, by the aid of anatomical knowledge, which shows how all things in the body are so connected, that when the lungs respire each and every thing in the entire body is moved by the respiration of the lungs, and at the same time from the beating of the heart. Anatomy shows that the heart is joined to the lungs through the auricles, which are continued into the interiors of the lungs; also that all the viscera of the entire body are joined through ligaments to the chamber of the breast; and so joined that when the lungs respire, each and all things, in general and in particular, partake of the respiratory motion. Thus when the lungs are inflated, the ribs expand the thorax, the pleura is dilated, and the diaphragm is stretched wide, and with these all the lower parts of the body, which are connected with them by ligaments therefrom, receive some action through the pulmonic action; not to mention further facts, lest those who have no knowledge of anatomy, on account of their ignorance of its terms should be confused in regard to the subject. Consult any skillful and discerning anatomist whether all things in the entire body, from the breast down be not so bound together, that when the lungs expand by respiration, each and all of them are moved to action synchronous with the pulmonic action. From all this the nature of the conjunction prepared by the will between the understanding and each and every thing of the human form is now evident. Only explore the connections well and scan them with an anatomical eye; then, following the connections, consider their cooperation with the breathing lungs and with the heart; and finally, in thought, substitute for the lungs the understanding, and for the heart the will, and you will see. </p>

<p>403. V. Quod Amor seu Voluntas praeparet omnia in humana sua forma, ut conjunctim cum Sapientia seu Intellectu possit agere. Dicitur Voluntas et Intellectus, sed probe sciendum est, quod Voluntas sit totus homo, est enim voluntas cum Intellectu in principiis in Cerebris, ac in principiatis in Corpore, et inde in toto et in qualibet parte, ut supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_403/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_365" target=_top>365-367</a>, ostensum est[;] inde constare potest, quod Voluntas sit totus homo quoad ipsam formam[,] tam communem, quam omnium particularem, et quod Intellectus sit ejus consocia, sicut est Pulmo Cordis. Caveat sibi quisque ne ideam Voluntatis foveat, sicut alicujus rei separatae a forma humana, est enim eadem. Ex hoc videri potest, non solum quomodo Voluntas praeparat thalamum pro Intellectu, sed etiam quomodo praeparat omnia in sua domo, quae est universum Corpus, ut conjunctim cum Intellectu possit agere: hoc praeparat eo modo, quod omnia et singula corporis conjuncta sint Intellectui sicut conjuncta sunt Voluntati, seu ut omnia et singula corporis <sup>1</sup>
sub obsequio Intellectus sint, sicut sub obsequio Voluntatis sunt.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Quomodo omnia et singula corporis ad conjunctionem cum Intellectu sicut cum Voluntate praeparata sunt, non videri potest, nisi sicut in speculo seu in imagine per scientiam anatomicam in Corpore[;] per illam scitur quomodo omnia in Corpore connexa sunt, ut dum Pulmo respirat, omnia et singula in toto Corpore a Respiratione pulmonis agantur, dum etiam a pulsu cordis: ex Anatomia notum est, quod Cor conjunctum sit Pulmoni per auriculas, et quod hae continuentur in Pulmonum interiora; tum quod omnia Viscera totius corporis cum Camera pectoris per ligamenta conjuncta sint, ac ita conjuncta, ut dum Pulmo respirat, omnia et singula in communi et in parte aliquid ex respiratorio motu recipiant; <sup>2</sup>
cum enim Pulmo tumescit, tunc costae expandunt thoracem, pleura <sup>3</sup>
dilatatur, <sup>4</sup>
et diaphragma diducitur, et cum his omnia inferiora corporis, quae per ligamenta ex illis connexa sunt, per actus pulmonicos recipiunt aliquem actum; ne memorem plura, ne illi qui non in scientia anatomica sunt, ex ignorantia terminorum illius scientiae in obscuritatem de hac re veniant: consule modo anatomiae gnaros et sagaces, annon omnia <sup>5</sup>
in toto corpore a pectore ad imum ita colligata sint, ut tumescente per respirationem pulmone, omnia et singula excitentur in actum pulmonico synchronum.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Ex his nunc patet, qualis praeparata est conjunctio Intellectus cum omnibus et singulis formae humanae a Voluntate; rimare modo nexus, et lustra illos oculo anatomico, et postea secundum nexus specta cooperationem illorum cum Pulmone respirante et cum Corde, et dein pro Pulmone cogita Intellectum, et pro corde Voluntatem, et videbis. <p>
