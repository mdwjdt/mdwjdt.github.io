<h4 align="center"></h4><p>117、有人以为亚当拥有如此自由或自由意志，以致他能出于自己爱神，变得智慧；只是这种自由意志在他的后代中丧失了。但这是一个错误，因为人不是生命，而是生命的接受者(参看4-6，54-60节)；凡为生命接受者的，都无法凭自己的任何能力去爱并变得智慧；因此，当亚当想要这样做的时候，他就从智慧与爱中堕落，并被逐出伊甸园。</p>

<p>
117. There are people who think that Adam had a kind of freedom or ability to choose that enabled him to love God and be wise on his own, and that this freedom to choose was lost in his descendants. This, however, is wrong. We are not life, but life-receivers (see <a href="4.htm" target=_top>4-6</a>, <a href="54.htm" target=_top>54-60</a> [<a href="55.htm" target=_top>55-60</a>] above); and people who are life-receivers cannot love and be wise from their own resources. So when Adam wanted to love and be wise from his own resources, he fell from wisdom and love and was cast out of the garden. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #117 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
117. There are people who suppose that Adam had such freedom or free will that he could love God and be wise of himself, and that this free will was lost in his posterity. But this is an error. For a person is not life but a recipient of life (see above, nos. <a href="4.htm">4-6</a>, <a href="55.htm">55-60</a>), and one who is a recipient of life cannot love and be wise by virtue of any power his own. Consequently when Adam tried to be wise and to love by his own power, he too fell from wisdom and love and was cast out of Paradise. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #117 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
117. Some are of the opinion that Adam was in such liberty and freedom of choice that he could love God and be wise from himself, and that this freedom of choice was lost in his posterity. But this is an error. For man is not Life but is a recipient of life (see above <a href="4.htm">4-6</a>, <a href="54.htm">54-60</a>), and he who is a recipient of life cannot love and be wise from anything of his own. Wherefore also when Adam willed to be wise and to love from himself, he fell from wisdom and love and was cast out of paradise. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #117 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
117. Some are of the opinion that Adam was in such liberty or freedom of choice as to be able to love God and be wise from himself, and that this freedom of choice was lost in his posterity. But this is an error; for man is not life, but is a recipient of life (see above <a href="4.htm" target=_top>(Divine Love and Wisdom 4-6)</a>, n. <a href="54.htm" target=_top>4-6, 54-60</a>); and he who is a recipient of life cannot love and be wise from anything of his own; consequently, when Adam willed to be wise and to love from what was his own he fell from wisdom and love, and was cast out of Paradise. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #117 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
117. Sunt qui opinantur quod Adamus in tali Libero seu Libero Arbitrio fuerit, ut a se potuerit amare Deum et sapere, et quod id Liberum arbitrium in posteris ejus deperditum sit; sed hoc est error; homo enim non est vita sed recipiens vitae, videatur supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_117/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_4" target=_top>4-6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_117/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_55" target=_top>55-60</a> <sup>1</sup>
; et qui est recipiens vitae, non potest ex aliquo suo amare et sapere: quare etiam ille, cum ex suo voluit sapere et amare, delapsus est a sapientia et amore, et ejectus est e Paradiso. <p>
