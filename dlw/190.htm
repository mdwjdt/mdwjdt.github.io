<h4 align="center"></h4><p>190、在世界上有存在、呈现为三个维度，或我们称之为复合物的一切事物，皆由高度层级或离散层级构成。举例可清楚说明这一点：我们通过肉眼观察知道，人体的每块肌肉都由细小的纤维构成，这些细小纤维一起组成小纤维束，以形成被称为运动纤维的较大纤维；这些纤维束又形成复合物，就是我们所说的肌肉。<br><br>神经也是如此；它们里面的细小纤维交织成细丝状的较大纤维，这些较大纤维组合起来构成神经。构成器官和脏腑的其它交织、捆扎、组合同样如此；因为这些是照相同层级进行各种组合的纤维和血管的构成。这也适用于植物界和矿物界的一切事物。木头里面就有以三重秩序交织起来的纤维联合体。金属和石头里面也有它们的成分以三重秩序组合起来的聚集体。由此可见离散层级的性质，即一个来自另一个，被称为复合物的第三层级通过第二层级存在；并且每个层级都不同于其它层级。</p>

190. Everything in the world characterized by three dimensions, that is, everything we call a compound, is constituted by three vertical or distinct levels. Some examples may make this clear. We know from visual experience that every muscle in the human body is made up of tiny fibers and that these, gathered into bundles, make up the larger fibers we call motor fibers. From these bundles come that compound entity called a muscle.<p>It is the same with our nerves. The smallest fibers in them are woven together into larger ones that look like threads, and gatherings of these are woven together into nerves. It is the same with the rest of the weavings, bundlings, and gatherings that make up our organs and viscera. They are compounds of fibers and vessels in various arrangements, depending on similar levels.<p>It is the same as well in all the members of the plant kingdom and all the members of the mineral kingdom. There are threefold gatherings of filaments in wood and threefold conglomerates of elements in metals and rocks as well.<p>We can see from this what distinct levels are like, namely that one level is made from another and a third from the second, the third being called a compound. Each level is distinct from the other. </p>

<p>190. All phenomena that occur in the world which exhibit a threefold dimension, or which are what we call composites, consist of degrees of height or discrete degrees. But let examples serve to illustrate.<p>We know from visual observation that every muscle in the human body consists of minute fibers, that these are composed into fascicles to form larger fibers called motor fibers, and that bundles of these constitute the composite which we call a muscle.<p>It is the same with nerves. In them minute fibers are woven together to form larger ones, which look like threads. Aggregations of these are woven together to form the nerve.<p> </p>
<p>[2] The same is the case in all the other weavings, bundlings and aggregations which make up the organs and viscera. For these are compositions of fibers and vessels variously formed in accordance with the same degrees.<p>The same is also the case in each and all constituents of the plant kingdom, and in each and all constituents of the mineral kingdom. In pieces of wood we find combinations of fibers woven together in a threefold arrangement. In metals and stones we find aggregations of their constituents also in a threefold arrangement.<p>This makes apparent the nature of discrete degrees, namely, that from one arises another, and through this a third, which is called the composite; and that each degree is distinct from any other. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #190 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>190. All things which exist in the world, about which a threefold dimension is predicated, or which are called composite, consist of degrees of height or discrete degrees. But examples will make this clear. It is known from ocular experience that every muscle in the human body consists of minute fibres and that these, gathered together into little bundles, form larger fibres, called motor fibres and that from groups of these exists the composite thing called a muscle. It is the same with nerves. In these from most minute fibres knitted together are formed greater ones which appear as filaments. From these massed together is woven the nerve. It is the same in the rest of the combinations, bundles and groupings out of which organs and viscera are made up; for these are composites out of fibres and vessels variously put together through similar degrees. It is also the same with each and every thing of the vegetable kingdom, and of the mineral kingdom. In woods there are combinations of filaments in threefold order. In metals and stones there are massed together parts also in threefold order. From these examples it is clear what discrete degrees are, namely, that one thing exists from another, and from this other, a third which is called a composite; and that each degree is discreted from the other. </p>

190. All things which have existence in the world, of which threefold dimension is predicated, that is, which are called compounds, consist of degrees of height, that is, discrete degrees; as examples will make clear. It is known from ocular experience, that every muscle in the human body consists of minute fibers, and these put together into little bundles form larger fibers, called motor fibers, and groups of these form the compound called a muscle. It is the same with nerves; in these from minute fibers larger fibers are compacted, which appear as filaments, and these grouped together compose the nerve. The same is true of the rest of the combinations, bundlings and groupings out of which the organs and viscera are made up; for these are compositions of fibers and vessels variously put together according to like degrees. It is the same also with each and every thing of the vegetable and mineral kingdoms. In woods there are combinations of filaments in threefold order. In metals and stones there are groupings of parts, also in threefold order. From all this the nature of discrete degrees can be seen, namely, that one is from the other, and through the second there is a third which is called the composite; and that each degree is discreted from the others. </p>

<p>190. Omnia quae in Mundo existunt, de quibus trina dimensio praedicatur, seu quae vocantur composita, ex Gradibus altitudinis seu discretis consistunt: sed exempla illustrent: ab experientia oculari notum est, quod <sup>1</sup>
unusquisque Musculus in corpore humano consistat ex minimis fibris, et quod hae fasciculatim compositae sistant fibras majores, quae motrices vocantur, et quod ex harum manipulis existat compositum, quod vocatur Musculus. Simile est cum Nervis; in illis ex fibris minimis compaginantur majores, quae sicut filamenta apparent[;] ex his congregatis compaginatur Nervus.<p> </p>
<p>[ <sup>2</sup>
] Simile est in reliquis compaginationibus, confasciationibus et congregationibus, ex quibus sunt Organa et Viscera; sunt enim haec compositiones ex fibris et vasis per similes gradus varie conformatis. Simile etiam est in omnibus et singulis Regni vegetabilis, et in omnibus et singulis Regni mineralis; in lignis sunt compaginationes filamentorum in triplici ordine; in metallis et lapidibus sunt conglobationes partium etiam in triplici ordine. Ex his patet, quales sunt Gradus discreti, quod nempe ab uno sit alterum,2 et per alterum[,] tertium, quod vocatur compositum; et quod unusquisque Gradus ab altero discretus sit. <p>
