<h4 align="center"></h4><p>81、抛开空间，完全弃绝真空的任何概念，然后再思想不含真空与真空的神性之爱与神性智慧是一切存在的绝对本质。此后根据空间来思考；你就会发现，神性在最大和最小空间上是一样的；因为从空间抽象出来的本质没有所谓的大小在里面，都是一样的。</p>

<p>
81. Take away space and absolutely rule out vacuum, and then think about divine love and wisdom as ultimate essence once space has been taken away and vacuum has been ruled out. Then think in terms of space, and you will see that Divinity is the same in the largest and the smallest instances of space. Once you remove space from essence, there is no "large" or "small." It is all the same. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #81 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
81. Eliminate space and reject utterly any notion of a vacuum, and with space eliminated and the notion of a vacuum rejected, think then of Divine love and wisdom as being the absolute essence of all being. Think after that in terms of space, and you will perceive that the Divine in the greatest and least intervals of space is the same. For essence abstracted from space has in it neither greatness nor smallness, but is ever the same. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #81 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
81. Put away space and completely deny a vacuum, and then think about Divine Love and Wisdom as being very Essence, space having been put away and a vacuum denied. Think next from space and you will perceive that the Divine in the greatest and least things of space is the same. For in Essence abstracted from space there is neither great nor small, but only the same. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #81 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
81. Put away space, and deny the possibility of a vacuum, and then think of Divine Love and of Divine Wisdom as being Essence itself, space having been put away and a vacuum denied. Then think according to space; and you will perceive that the Divine, in the greatest and in the least things of space, is the same; for in essence abstracted from space there is neither great nor small, but only the same. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #81 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
81. Abstrahe spatium, et prorsus nega vacuum, et cogita tunc de Divino Amore et de Divina sapientia, quod sint ipsa Essentia abstracto spatio et negato vacuo; cogita dein ex spatio, et percipies, quod Divinum sit in maximis et minimis spatii, idem; non datur enim in Essentia abstracta a spatio magnum et parvum, sed idem. </p>
