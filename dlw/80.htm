<h4 align="center"></h4><p>80、神性在最大和最小的一切无生命的受造物上也是一样的，因为神性存在于它们功用的一切良善中。此外，它们之所以没有生命，是因为它们并非生命的形式，而是功用的形式；形式照功用的良善而各不相同。至于神性如何居于这些事物，我们会在论述创造时予以解释。</p>

<p>
80. Divinity is also the same in the largest and smallest of inanimate created things. It is actually present in every benefit of the function that they serve. The reason they are not alive is that they are forms of functions rather than forms of life, and the form will vary depending on the benefit of the function. I will be explaining how Divinity is present in them later, when we get to the subject of creation. </p>

<p>
80. The Divine is also the same in the greatest and least of all created things that are without life; for it is present in every good of the use they serve. They are, however, without life, because they are not forms of life but forms of useful endeavors; and the form varies in accordance with the goodness of the use.<p>But how the Lord dwells in these will be explained in subsequent discussions where we take up creation. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #80 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
80. The Divine is also the same in the greatest and the least of all created things which are not alive, for it is in all the good of their use. The reason they are not alive, however, is because they are not forms of life but they are forms of uses, and the form varies according to the excellence of the use. But how the Divine is in them will be told in what follows where creation is treated of. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #80 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
80. The Divine is also the same in the greatest and in the least of all created things that are not alive; for it is in all the good of their use. These, moreover, are not alive for the reason that they are not forms of life but forms of uses; and the form varies according to the excellence of the use. But how the Divine is in these things will be stated in what follows, where creation is treated of. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #80 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
80. Divinum etiam est idem in maximis et minimis omnium quae creata sunt, et non vivunt; est enim in omni bono usus illorum; quod autem non vivant, est quia non formae vitae sed formae usuum sunt; ac forma secundum bonitatem usus est varia. Sed quomodo Divinum in illis est, in sequentibus, ubi de Creatione, dicetur. </p>
