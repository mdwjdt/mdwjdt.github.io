<h4 align="center"></h4><p>107、最有必要知道的是，有两轮太阳，一轮是属灵的，一轮是属世的；属灵的太阳适合灵界的人，属世的太阳适合自然界的人。如果不知道这一点，就无法正确理解创造和人类，也就是此处所要论述的主题。诚然，我们也许能看到结果，但若非同时看到结果的原因，就只能如同在夜间的黑暗中那样看见结果。</p>

<p>
107. It is of critical importance to realize that there are two suns, a spiritual one and a physical one, the spiritual sun for people who are in the spiritual world and the physical sun for people who are in the physical world. Unless this is recognized, there can be no real comprehension of creation or of humanity, subjects we are about to deal with. True, some effects can be seen, but unless the causes behind the effects are seen at the same time, it is like looking at the effects in the night. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #107 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
107. It is most necessary for it to be known that there are two suns, one spiritual and the other natural - the spiritual sun for people who are in the spiritual world, and the natural sun for people who are in the natural world. Unless this is known, one cannot properly understand any facet of creation and mankind, which are the subjects we are going to take up. Some effects may indeed be seen, but unless the causes of the effects are seen at the same time, the effects can be visible only as though in the darkness of night. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #107 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
107. It is most necessary for it to be known that there are two suns, one spiritual and the other natural, a spiritual Sun for those who are in the spiritual world, and a natural sun for those who are in the natural world. Unless this is known, nothing can be rightly understood about creation and about man, the subjects here treated of. Effects may indeed be seen, but unless at the same time the causes of the effects are seen, the effects can appear only as in the dark. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #107 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
107. It is very necessary to be known that there are two suns, one spiritual, the other natural; a spiritual sun for those who are in the spiritual world, and a natural sun for those who are in the natural world. Unless this is known, nothing can be properly understood about creation and about man, which are the subjects here to be treated of. Effects may, it is true, be observed, but unless at the same time the causes of effects are seen, effects can only appear as it were in the darkness of night. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #107 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
107. Maxime necessarium est, ut sciatur, quod duo Soles sint, unus Spiritualis et alter naturalis, <sup>1</sup>
Sol spiritualis pro illis qui in Mundo spirituali sunt, et Sol naturalis pro illis qui in Mundo naturali sunt: nisi hoc sciatur, non potest aliquid juste intelligi de Creatione et de Homine, de quibus agendum est; effectus quidem possunt videri, sed nisi simul causae effectuum videntur, non apparere possunt effectus quam sicut in nocte. <p>
