<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">1.12 神性之爱与神性智慧必在它所创造的其它事物中存在并显现</h4><p>47、爱的本质不是爱自己，而是爱他人，并通过爱与他人结合。此外，被他人所爱也是爱的本质，因为由此才能产生结合。一切爱的本质都在于结合；事实上，这是爱的生命，被称为享受、愉悦、满足、欢喜、甜蜜、祝福、快乐和幸福。爱就在于：自己的就是别人的；感受别人的喜乐如同自己里面的喜乐；这就是在爱。但在别人身上感受自己的喜乐，而不是在自己里面感受别人的喜乐不是在爱，因为这是爱自己，而前者才是爱邻舍；这两种爱彼此截然对立。诚然，这两种爱都产生结合；在别人身上爱自己的东西，也就是爱自己，似乎并未造成分离；但它的确导致分离，以至于人以这种方式有多爱别人，后来就有多恨别人。因为这种结合会逐渐自行松散，然后爱转变成同等程度的恨。</p>

<p>
47. Divine love and wisdom cannot fail to be and to be manifested in others that it has created. The hallmark of love is not loving ourselves but loving others and being united to them through love. The hallmark of love is also being loved by others because this is how we are united. Truly, the essence of all love is to be found in union, in the life of love that we call joy, delight, pleasure, sweetness, blessedness, contentment, and happiness.<p>The essence of love is that what is ours should belong to someone else. Feeling the joy of someone else as joy within ourselves--that is loving. Feeling our joy in others, though, and not theirs in ourselves is not loving. That is loving ourselves, while the former is loving our neighbor. These two kinds of love are exact opposites. True, they both unite us; and it does not seem as though loving what belongs to us, or loving ourselves in the other, is divisive. Yet it is so divisive that to the extent that we love others in this way we later harbor hatred for them. Step by step our union with them dissolves, and the love becomes hatred of corresponding intensity. </p>

47. Divine love and wisdom cannot but be and have expression in others it creates. The essence of love is not to love self, but to love others and through love to be conjoined with them. It is also the essence of love to be loved by others, for thus is conjunction achieved. The essential ingredient in all love consists in conjunction; indeed in it consists its life, which we call pleasure, gratification, delight, sweetness, bliss, happiness and felicity.<p>Love consists in willing what one has to be another's, and in feeling the other's delight as delight within oneself. That is what it is to love. In contrast, to feel one's own delight in another, and not the other's delight within oneself, is not to love; for this is loving self, whereas the first is loving the neighbor.<p>These two types of love are diametrically opposite each other in nature. Both indeed conjoin, and to love what one has in another - in other words, to love oneself in another - does not appear to undo that conjunction; but in fact it does so undo the conjunction that the more anyone has loved another in this way, the more the other eventually hates him. For such a conjunction gradually becomes undone of itself, and love then turns to hatred to the degree that it does. </p>

47. THE DIVINE LOVE AND THE DIVINE WISDOM CANNOT BE OTHER THAN ESSE AND EXISTERE IN OTHERS CREATED BY ITSELF <p>Love in itself is not to love self, but to love others and to be conjoined with them by love. An essential of love also is to be loved by others, for thus is conjunction effected. The essence of all love consists in conjunction, it is indeed its life which is called enjoyment, delight, sweetness, blessedness, happiness and felicity. Love consists in this that its own is another's; and to feel another's joy as joy in oneself, this is to love. But to feel one's joy in another and not the other's joy in oneself, this is not to love, for the latter is loving one's self, the former loving the neighbour. The two kinds of love are diametrically opposed to one another. Either kind of love does indeed conjoin; and it does not appear that to love oneself, that is, to love oneself in another, disjoins. But yet it does disjoin to such a degree that, so far as anyone has loved another in this manner, so far he afterwards hates him. For such a conjunction is by itself successively dissolved, and then, in like measure, the love becomes hatred. </p>

<p>
47. DIVINE LOVE AND DIVINE WISDOM MUST NECESSARILY HAVE BEING [Esse] AND HAVE FORM [Existere] IN OTHERS CREATED BY ITSELF. <p>It is the essential of love not to love self, but to love others, and to be conjoined with others by love. It is the essential of love, moreover, to be loved by others, for thus conjunction is effected. The essence of all love consists in conjunction; this, in fact, is its life, which is called enjoyment, pleasantness, delight, sweetness, bliss, happiness, and felicity. Love consists in this, that its own should be another's; to feel the joy of another as joy in oneself, that is loving. But to feel one's own joy in another and not the other's joy in oneself is not loving; for this is loving self, while the former is loving the neighbor. These two kinds of love are diametrically opposed to each other. Either, it is true, conjoins; and to love one's own, that is, oneself, in another does not seem to divide; but it does so effectually divide that so far as any one has loved another in this manner, so far he afterwards hates him. For such conjunction is by its own action gradually loosened, and then, in like measure, love is turned to hate. </p>

<p>
47. QUOD DIVINUS AMOR ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA NON POSSIT ALITER QUAM ESSE ET EXISTERE IN ALIIS A SE CREATIS. Ipsum amoris non est amare se, sed est amare alios, ac illis per amorem conjungi; ipsum amoris etiam est ab aliis amari, sic enim conjungitur; essentia omnis amoris in conjunctione consistit, imo vita ejus quae vocatur jucunditas, amaenitas, delitium, dulcedo, beatitudo, faustitas et felicitas. Amor in eo consistit, ut suum sit alterius, ac ut sentiat ejus jucundum ut jucundum in se; hoc est amare; at sentire suum jucundum in altero, et non ejus in se, non est amare, hoc enim est amare se, illud autem amare proximum: illa duo amoris genera sunt e diametro sibi opposita: utrumque quidem conjungit, et non apparet, quod amare suum, hoc est, se in altero, disjungat, cum tamen ita disjungit, ut quantum quis alterum sic amaverit, tantum postea illum odio habeat; solvitur enim conjunctio illa a se successive, et tunc amor fit odium in simili gradu. </p>
