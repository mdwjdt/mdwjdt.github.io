<h4 align="center"></h4><p>407、事实就是如此，这一点可通过心与肺的结合从经验上得到证实，因为意愿与心并理解力与肺之间的对应关系乃是这样：爱与理解力的属灵互动方式，跟心与肺的属世互动方式是一样的。因此，上述观察资料可见于心与肺，如同可见于呈现在眼前的一个形像。只要心与肺不一起运作，人就没有任何生命的感觉或生命的活力，这一点从子宫内的胎儿或婴孩和它出生后的状态明显可知。只要人还是个胎儿，也就是还在子宫里，肺就是关闭的。所以，他没有任何感觉，也没有任何行动。他的感觉器官是关闭的，手脚也受到束缚。但出生后肺就打开，并且随着它们打开，人开始去感觉和行动。肺由心脏所输入的血液打开。<br><br>没有心肺的合作，人既没有生命的感觉，也没有生命的活力，这一点从昏厥的情形明显看出来。在昏厥期间，只有心脏起作用，肺脏不起作用，因为这时呼吸停止了。众所周知，在这种情况下，人既没有任何感觉，也不能进行任何行动。人在窒息时也是如此，无论是被水窒息，还是被阻塞喉部、关闭呼吸道的任何东西窒息。人们知道，这时，人看上去就像死了一样，没有感觉，也不能行动；然而，从心脏的角度来说，他还活着。因为一旦清除肺部阻塞物，他就会恢复生命的感觉和生命的活力。诚然，在此期间，血液仍通过肺脏循环，却是通过肺动脉和肺静脉，而不是通过支气管动脉和支气管静脉循环的；而赋予人呼吸能力的，正是后者。爱进入理解力的流注也是这种情况。</p>

407. We can find striking support for this in the union of the heart with the lungs, since it is in the nature of the volition-heart and discernment-lungs correspondence that the heart acts with the lungs on the physical level the way volition acts with discernment on the spiritual level. This enables us to see what I have been talking about in a kind of visual image.<p>As for our lack of any sensory life, and therefore of any active life, when heart and lungs are not working together, this is evidenced by the state of a fetus or infant in the womb and the state of the same after birth. As long as the individual is a fetus or is in the womb, the lungs are closed. As a result, the individual has no sensation or action. The sense organs are closed, the hands are restrained, and so are the feet. After birth, though, the lungs are opened, and as they are opened we sense and act. The lungs are opened by blood that flows in from the heart.<p>We can also see from people who have fainted that if the heart and the lungs are not working together we are deprived of both sensory and active life. When people have fainted, only the heart is working, not the lungs--breathing has been taken away. Everyone knows that people who have fainted are deprived of sensation and action.<p>It is the same with people who suffocate, whether by water or because of something that blocks their windpipe and closes off the lungs' breathing passage. People then seem to be dead, having neither sensation nor action. Yet we know that the heart is still keeping them alive. They in fact return to both sensory and active life as soon as the blockages of the lungs are removed. In the meantime, blood has been making its circuit through the lungs, but only through the pulmonary arteries and veins, not through the bronchial arteries and veins; and these latter give us the ability to breathe.<p>It is the same with the inflow of love into discernment. </p>

<p>407. The reality of this can be empirically confirmed from the conjunction of the heart with the lungs, because there is such a correspondence between the will and the heart, and between the intellect and the lungs, that the way love interacts with the intellect spiritually is the way the heart interacts with the lungs naturally. Consequently the foregoing observations can be seen in the heart and the lungs as in an image visible to the eye.<p>The fact that a person is not in the enjoyment of any sensory life or any active life as long as the heart and the lungs do not operate together is evident from the state of a fetus or baby in the womb and its state after birth. As long as the person is a fetus or in the womb, the lungs are closed. Therefore he is without any sensation and incapable of any action. His sensory organs are closed, his hands are held bound, and so also his feet. But after birth the lungs are opened, and as these are opened the person begins to feel sensation and to act. The lungs are opened by blood transmitted from the heart.<p> </p>
<p>[2] The fact that a person is not in the enjoyment of any sensory life or any active life without the joint operation of the heart and the lungs is apparent also from cases of fainting. During periods of fainting the heart alone acts, and not the lungs, for the respiration is then stopped. People know that during these periods a person is without any sensation and incapable of any action.<p>The case is the same with a person being suffocated, whether by water or by something that obstructs the air passage and closes the way for the lungs' respiration. People know that the person then appears as though dead, without sensation and incapable of action, and yet as regards the heart is still alive. For he returns into both his sensory life and his active life as soon the obstructions of the lungs are removed.<p>The blood, indeed, does meanwhile circulate through the lungs, but through the pulmonary arteries and veins, and not through the bronchial arteries and veins; and it is the latter which give a person the ability to breathe.<p>The case is the same with the influx of love into the intellect. </p>

<p>407. That it is so can be confirmed to the life from the conjunction of the heart with the lungs, because the correspondence between the will and the heart, and between the understanding and the lungs, is such that just as love acts with the understanding spiritually, so does the heart act with the lungs naturally; hence what has been said above may be seen as in an image presented to the eye. That man neither has any sensate life nor any active life so long as the heart and lungs do not act together, is evident from the state of the embryo or of the infant in the womb, and from its state after birth. As long as man is an embryo, or in the womb, the lungs are closed; consequently he possesses neither feeling nor action; the organs of sense are sealed up, the hands are bound and the feet likewise; but after birth the lungs are opened, and in proportion as they are opened so man feels and acts; the lungs are opened by the blood sent into them from the heart. That man has neither sensate nor active life without the co-operation of the heart and lungs is evident also in swoons, when the heart alone acts and not the lungs, for breathing is then suspended. In these cases it is well known that there is no sensation and no movement. The same is true of a man suffocated, whether it be by water, or by something blocking the larynx and closing the breathing passage of the lungs. The man appears at the time to be dead, he feels nothing and does nothing, and yet is alive at heart, as is well known, for he returns to both his sensate and active life, as soon as the obstruction of the lungs is removed. It is true the blood circulates in the meantime through the lungs, but through the pulmonary arteries and veins, and not through the bronchial arteries and veins, which give man the power to breath. It is the same with the influx of love into the understanding. </p>

407. That this is so can be proved to the life by the conjunction of the heart with the lungs, because the correspondence between the will and the heart, and between the understanding and the lungs, is such that just as the love acts with the understanding spiritually, so does the heart act with the lungs naturally: from this, what has been said above can be seen as in an image presented to the eye. That man has neither any sensitive life nor any active life, so long as the heart and the lungs do not act together, is evident from the state of the fetus or the infant in the womb, and from its state after birth. So long as man is a fetus, that is, in the womb, the lungs are closed, wherefore he has no feeling nor any action; the organs of sense are closed up, the hands are bound, likewise the feet; but after birth the lungs are opened, and as they are opened man feels and acts; the lungs are opened by means of the blood sent into them from the heart. That man has neither sensitive life nor active life without the co-operation of the heart and the lungs, is evident also in swoons, when the heart alone acts, and not the lungs, for respiration then ceases; in this case there is no sensation and no action, as is well known. It is the same with persons suffocated, either by water or by anything obstructing the larynx and closing the respiratory passage; it is well-known that the man then appears to be dead, he feels nothing and does nothing; and yet he is alive in the heart; for he returns to both his sensitive and his active life as soon as the obstructions to the lungs are removed. The blood, it is true, circulates in the meantime through the lungs, but through the pulmonary arteries and veins, not through the bronchial arteries and veins, and these last are what give man the power of breathing.

<p>407. Quod ita sit, ad vivum confirmari potest ex conjunctione cordis cum pulmone, quia talis correspondentia <sup>1</sup>
est inter voluntatem et cor, ac inter intellectum et pulmonem, ut sicut amor cum intellectu spiritualiter agit, ita cor cum pulmone naturaliter; inde possunt supradicta sicut in imagine oblata oculo videri. Quod homo non in aliqua vita sensitiva sit, nec in aliqua vita activa sit, dum cor et pulmo non simul agunt, constat ex statu embryonis seu infantis in utero, et ex statu ejus post partum; quamdiu homo est embryo, seu in utero, pulmones clausi sunt[;] inde ei non est aliquis sensus, nec aliquis actus[;] sensoria sunt occlusa, manus sunt ligatae, similiter pedes; at post partum aperiuntur pulmones, et sicut hi aperiuntur, ita homo sentit et agit; aperiuntur pulmones per immissum e corde sanguinem.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Quod homo non in aliqua vita sensitiva, nec in aliqua vita activa sit, absque cooperatione cordis et pulmonis, patet quoque a deliquiis[;] in illis solum cor agit, et non pulmo, est enim tunc respiratio adempta; quod in illis nulla sensatio sit, nec ulla actio, notum est. Simile est cum homine qui suffocatur, sive sit per aquam, sive per aliquod quod obstipat laryngem, et claudit viam pro respiratione pulmonis[;] quod homo tunc appareat sicut mortuus, nihil sentiat et nihil agat, et quod usque vivat corde, notum est; redit enim in utramque vitam, sensitivam et activam, ut primum obstipationes pulmonis remotae sunt. Sanguis quidem interea agit circulum per pulmonem, sed per arterias et venas pulmonares, sed non per arterias et venas bronchiales, et hae dant homini facultatem respirandi. Simile est cum influxu amoris in intellectum. <p>
