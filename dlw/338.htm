<h4 align="center"></h4><p>338、⑴何谓地上的恶用。地上的恶用是指动植物和矿物界中的一切有害物。没有必要将它们都一一列举出来，因为这只是堆砌名称而已。不指明每一种所造成的损害，一味列举名称无助于本书所关注的目的。为了澄清，仅举其中几例就足够了：动物界的有害物包括毒蛇、蝎子、鳄鱼、大蛇、角鸮、尖叫鸮或猫头鹰、老鼠、蝗虫、青蛙、蜘蛛；以及苍蝇、黄蜂、蟑螂、虱子、蜱虫和螨虫；总之，就是毁坏青草、叶子、果实、种子、食物和可饮用液体，并危害动物和人类的生物。植物界的有害物包括一切有害、致命、有毒的草本植物，以及具有类似属性的豆科植物和灌木。矿物界的有害物包括地上的一切有毒物质。从这几个例子可以看出何谓地上的恶用；恶用就是与善用对立的一切事物(对此，可参看336节)。</p>

338, 1. Which things in our world I mean by "evil functions." "Evil functions" in our world means everything harmful in both kingdoms, the animal and the plant, and harmful things in the mineral kingdom as well. There is no room to list all the harmful things in these kingdoms, for this would be simply to pile up names; and piling up names with no indication of what kind of harm each species inflicts would bring none of the usefulness this work intends. I may simply name a few by way of information.<p>In the animal kingdom, there are poisonous snakes, scorpions, crocodiles, lizards, owls, mice, locusts, frogs, and spiders, and also flies, wasps, moths, lice, and mites. In short, there is everything that consumes grains, leaves, fruits, and seeds, our food and our drink, and inflicts harm on animals and people. In the plant kingdom there are many herbs that are harmful, poisonous, and lethal, as well as plants and shrubs of the same sort. In the mineral kingdom there are all the toxic substances.<p>We can see from these few examples what I mean by "evil functions" in this world of ours. "Evil functions" are all the things that conflict with the good functions discussed in the previous section. </p>

338. (1) What we mean by evil forms of use on the earth. By evil forms of use on the earth we mean all harmful forms in each of the animal and plant kingdoms, and also harmful forms in the mineral kingdom.<p>We do not have the space to enumerate all the harmful forms in these kingdoms, for to do so would be only to amass a list of names, and amassing a list of names without indicating the harm each kind causes would not serve the purpose which this work has as its end. For the sake of clarification, it is sufficient that we name here some of them.<p>In the animal kingdom, such forms include venomous snakes, scorpions, crocodiles, dragons, <sup>1</sup>
eagle owls, screech owls, mice and rats, locusts, frogs, and spiders. Also flies, wasps, cockroaches, lice, ticks and mites. In a word, creatures that consume grasses, leaves, fruits, seeds, foodstuffs and drinkable liquids, and are harmful to other animals and people.<p>In the plant kingdom, such forms include malignant, virulent and toxic herbage. Also vegetable matter and shrubbery of the same character.<p>In the mineral kingdom, such forms include all poisonous substances of the earth.<p>From these few examples it can be seen what we mean by evil forms of use on the earth. For evil forms of use are all forms that are opposed to the good forms of use described just above in the preceding discussion. <sup>2</sup>

338. (i) What is meant by evil uses on the earth. By evil uses on the earth are understood all noxious things in both the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and also in the mineral kingdom. It is needless to enumerate all the noxious things in these kingdoms for this would merely heap up names, and doing this without indicating the harmful effect that each kind produces would not serve the use which this work has in view. For the sake of information a few examples will suffice. Such in the animal kingdom are poisonous snakes, scorpions, crocodiles, dragons, horned owls, screech owls, mice, locusts, frogs, and spiders, as well as flies, drones, moths, lice, mites, in a word, creatures that destroy grasses, leaves, fruits, seeds, meat and drink, and do injury to beasts and men. In the vegetable kingdom there are all malignant, virulent and poisonous herbs, and leguminous plants and shrubs of like character; in the mineral kingdom all the poisonous earths. From these few examples it can be seen what is meant by evil uses on earth. For evil uses are all the things which are opposed to good uses, about which see a preceding section (<a href="336.htm">336</a>). </p>

338. (1) What is meant by evil uses on the earth. By evil uses on earth are meant all noxious things in both the animal and vegetable kingdom, also in the mineral kingdom. It is needless to enumerate all the noxious things in these kingdoms, for to do so would merely heap up names, and doing this without indicating the noxious effect that each kind produces would not contribute to the object which this work has in view. For the sake of information a few examples will suffice:-In the animal kingdom there are poisonous serpents, scorpions, crocodiles, great snakes, horned owls, screech owls, mice, locusts, frogs, spiders; also flies, drones, moths, lice, mites; in a word, creatures that destroy grasses, leaves, fruits, seed, food, and drink, and are harmful to beast and man. In the vegetable kingdom there are all hurtful, virulent, and poisonous herbs, with leguminous plants and shrubs of like character; and in the mineral kingdom all poisonous earths. From these few examples it can be seen what is meant by evil uses on earth; for evil uses are all things that are opposite to good uses (of which, in the preceding paragraph, n. <a href="336.htm" target=_top>336</a>). </p>

 338. I. Quid super tellure intelligitur per usus malos. Per usus malos super tellure intelliguntur omnia noxia in utroque Regno, Animali et Vegetabili, et quoque noxia in Regno minerali. Omnia noxia in illis Regnis non vacat enumerare, nam hoc foret congerere nomina, ac nomina congerere absque indicatione noxae, quam quodlibet genus producit, non fert illum usum, quem hoc Opus pro fine habet. Propter scientiam sufficit hic aliqua nominare. Talia sunt in Regno animali Serpentes venenati, Scorpii, Crocodili, Dracones, Bubones, Ululae, Mures, Locustae, Ranae, Araneae; tum Muscae, Fuci, Blattae, Pediculi, Acari, verbo quae consumunt gramina, folia, fructus, semina, cibos et potus, et noxam inferunt bestiis et hominibus. In Regno vegetabili sunt omnes Herbae malignae, virulentae et toxicatae; et similia Legumina et Virgulta. In Regno minerali omnes Terrae venenatae. Ex his paucis videri potest, quid per usus malos super tellure intelligitur: sunt enim Usus mali omnia quae opposita sunt usibus bonis, de quibus in mox praecedente Articulo. </p>
