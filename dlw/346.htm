346, 6. There are two forms in which activation by inflow occurs, the plant form and the animal form. It is common knowledge that our earth brings forth only two basic forms, since there are two kingdoms of nature called the animal kingdom and the plant kingdom. All the members of each kingdom have many things in common. In the animal kingdom, for example, all its members have organs of sense as well as organs of motion, members, and viscera that are animated by their brains, hearts, and lungs. As for the plant kingdom, all its members put down roots into the ground and form stems, branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds. If we look at the way both the animal and the plant kingdoms are brought forth in these forms, the beginning is by a spiritual inflow and a working from heaven's sun, where the Lord is, and not from any inflow and working of nature from its sun. This serves only to stabilize them, as already noted [<a href="339.htm" target=_top>339-340</a>].<p>All the greater and lesser animals start from something spiritual on the lowest level, the one called "earthly." Only we humans come from all the levels, from the three that are called heavenly, spiritual, and earthly. Since each vertical or distinct step declines gradually from perfection to imperfection the way light declines into darkness, so do animals. The perfect ones are elephants, camels, horses, mules, cattle, sheep, goats, and the other members of flocks and herds. The less perfect are the winged ones, and the imperfect are fish and shellfish. Since they are the lowest of this level, it is as though they were in darkness, while the others are in light.<p>Still, since these all get their life only from the lowest spiritual level, the one called earthly, the only direction they can look is toward the earth and their food and, for propagation, their kindred. For all of them, their soul is an earthly desire and urge.<p>The same holds true for members of the plant kingdom. There are complete, less complete, and incomplete ones. The complete ones are fruit trees, the less complete are vines and shrubs, and the incomplete are grains. However, plants derive a usefulness from the spiritual reality that is their source, and animals derive passionate and impulsive natures from the spiritual reality that is their source, as already noted [<a href="313.htm" target=_top>313-316</a>]. </p>

<p>346. (6) The two kinds of forms into which influx operates are plant forms and animal forms. The earth produces only two universal forms, as people know from their acquaintance with the two kingdoms of nature called the animal kingdom and the plant kingdom. They also know that all the constituents of the same one kingdom have much in common. So for example, in constituents of the animal kingdom we find sense organs and motor organs, and members and viscera, which are actuated by brains, hearts and lungs. And in the plant kingdom, its constituents take root in the earth and produce a stem, branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds.<p>The productions of both the animal kingdom and the plant kingdom into their forms take their origin from the spiritual influx and operation of the sun of heaven where the Lord is, and except for the fixing of their forms, as stated above, not from the influx and operation of nature from its sun.<p> </p>
<p>[2] All animals, great and small, take their origin from something spiritual in the lowest degree, which is called natural. The human being alone is a product of all the degrees, of which there are three, called celestial, spiritual and natural.<p>Because every degree of height or discrete degree ranges from its highest level of perfection to its lowest by a continuous succession, as light fades to dark, so also do animals. Consequently there are higher forms, lower forms, and lowest forms of these. Higher animals include elephants, camels, horses, mules, cattle, sheep, goats, and the rest that are animals either of the herd or the flock. Lower animals are birds. And the lowest ones are fish and shellfish, which, being the lowest forms of this degree, live almost in a state of darkness, while the higher live in the light.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Nevertheless, because animals have life only from the lowest spiritual degree, called natural, they cannot look in any other direction than to the ground and to their food there, and to others of their kind for the sake of their propagation. The soul in all of these is a natural affection or appetite.<p>It is the same with constituents of the plant kingdom, in which there are higher, lower and lowest forms. The higher forms are fruit trees. Lower forms are grapevines and bushes. And the lowest forms are grasses.<p>Plants, however, take from the spiritual origin from which they spring the characteristic of being forms of service, while animals take from the spiritual origin from which they spring the characteristic of being forms, as we said, of affections and appetites. </p>

<p>346. (vi) There are two forms into which operation by influx takes place, the vegetable and the animal form. That two universal forms only are produced from the earth is known from the two kingdoms of nature, which are called the animal and vegetable kingdoms. And all the things of either kingdom have many features in common. Thus the subjects of the animal kingdom have organs of sense and organs of motion, members and viscera also, which are actuated by brains, heart and lungs; while the subjects of the vegetable kingdom send a root into the ground and bring forth stem, branches, leaves, flowers, fruit and seeds. Both kingdoms, animal and vegetable alike, as to productions into their forms, derive their origin by spiritual influx and operation from the Sun of heaven where the Lord is, and not from the influx and operation of nature from her sun, except the fixation of them, as was said above. All animals, great and small, derive their origin from the spiritual in the lowest degree, which is called natural, and man alone from all the degrees, of which there are three, called celestial, spiritual, and natural. As each degree of height, or discrete degree, decreases from its perfection to its imperfection by continuity, as light does to shade, so also do animals; wherefore there are perfect, less perfect, and imperfect animals. The perfect animals are elephants, camels, horses, mules, oxen, sheep, goats, and others, either of the herd or flock. The less perfect are birds. The imperfect are fish and shell fish; these, since they are the lowest of their degree, are, as it were, in shade, while the former are in light. Yet since they live solely from the lowest spiritual degree, which is called the natural, animals cannot look elsewhere than towards the earth and the food there, and to their own kind for the sake of propagation. The soul of all these is natural affection and appetite. It is the same with the subjects of the vegetable kingdom, which include the perfect, less perfect, and imperfect. The perfect are fruit trees, the less perfect are grape vines and shrubs, and the imperfect are grasses. From the spiritual, which is their origin, vegetables derive that they are uses, and animals derive that they are affections and appetites, as has been said. </p>

346. (6) There are two forms into which the operation by influx takes place, the vegetable and the animal form. That there are only two universal forms produced out of the earth is known from the two kingdoms of nature, called the animal and the vegetable kingdoms, also that all the subjects of either kingdom possess many things in common. Thus the subjects of the animal kingdom have organs of sense and organs of motion and members and viscera that are actuated by brains, hearts, and lungs. So the subjects of the vegetable kingdom send down a root into the ground, and bring forth stem, branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds. Both the animal and the vegetable kingdoms, as regards the production of their forms, derive their origin from spiritual influx and operation out of the sun of heaven where the Lord is, and not from the influx and operation of nature out of her sun; from this they derive nothing except their fixation, as was said above. All animals, great and small, derive their origin from the spiritual in the outmost degree, which is called the natural; man alone from all three degrees, called the celestial, spiritual, and natural. As each degree of height or discrete degree decreases from its perfection to its imperfection, as light to shade, by continuity, so do animals; there are therefore perfect, less perfect, and imperfect animals. The perfect animals are elephants, camels, horses, mules, oxen, sheep, goats, and others which are of the herd or the flock; the less perfect are birds; and the imperfect are fish and shell-fish; these, as being the lowest of that degree, are as it were in shade, while the former are in light. Yet animals, since they live only from the lowest spiritual degree, which is called the natural, can look nowhere else than towards the earth and to food there, and to their own kind for the sake of propagation; the soul of all these is natural affection and appetite. The subjects of the vegetable kingdom comprise, in like manner, the perfect, less perfect, and imperfect; the perfect are fruit trees, the less perfect are vines and shrubs, and the imperfect are grasses. But plants derive from the spiritual out of which they spring that they are uses, while animals derive from the spiritual out of which they spring that they are affections and appetites, as was shown above. </p>

<p>346. VI. Quod binae formae sint, in quas operatio per influxum fit, forma <sup>1</sup>
vegetabilis et forma animalis. Quod non nisi quam binae formae universales producantur ex tellure, notum est ex binis Regnis naturae, quae vocantur Regnum animale et Regnum vegetabile; et quod omnia unius Regni multa communia habeant, ut Regnum animale, quod in ejus subjectis sint organa sensuum et organa motuum, tum membra et viscera, quae a Cerebris, cordibus et pulmonibus actuantur: ac Regnum vegetabile, quod ejus subjecta radicem in terra agant, producant caulem, ramos, folia, flores, fructus, semina. Utrumque Regnum tam animale quam vegetabile, quoad productiones in suas formas, ab influxu et operatione spirituali e Sole coeli, ubi est Dominus, trahunt suum ortum, et non ex influxu et operatione naturae e Sole ejus, praeter fixationem eorum, ut supra dictum est.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Omnia animalia, majora et minora, trahunt ortum ex spirituali in ultimo gradu, qui naturalis vocatur[;] solus homo ab omnibus gradibus, qui tres sunt, et vocantur coelestis, spiritualis et naturalis. Quia unusquisque gradus altitudinis seu discretus a suo perfecto ad suum imperfectum <sup>2</sup>
decrescit sicut lux ad umbram, per continuum, ita quoque animalia; quare ex illis dantur perfecta, minus perfecta et imperfecta; Animalia perfecta sunt Elephantes, Cameli, Equi, Muli, Boves, Oves, Caprae, et reliqua quae sunt vel Armenti vel Gregis: minus perfecta sunt volatilia; et imperfecta sunt pisces, conchilia, quae quia sunt infima illius gradus, sunt sicut in umbra, cum illa in luce.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Sed usque quia solum vivunt ex ultimo gradu spirituali, qui naturalis vocatur, non spectare possunt aliorsum quam ad terram, <sup>3</sup>
et ad victum ibi, et ad consocios propter propagationem; anima omnium illorum est affectio naturalis, et appetitus. Simile est cum subjectis Regni vegetabilis, quod sint perfecta, minus perfecta et imperfecta; perfecta sunt arbores fructus, minus perfecta sunt arbores vini et virgulta, ac imperfecta sunt gramina: sed vegetabilia trahunt ex spirituali ex quo, quod sint usus, et animalia ex spirituali ex quo, quod sint affectiones et appetitus, ut dictum est. <p>
