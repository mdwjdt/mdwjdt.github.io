<h4 align="center"></h4><p>223、关于这个主题，天使的声明如下：没有什么东西如此细小，以至于没有这两种层级在里面。例如，任何动物，任何植物，任何矿物，任何以太或空气里面没有任何成分如此细小，以至于没有这两种层级在里面。此外，由于以太和空气是传送热和光的容器，属灵之热和属灵之光是传送爱和智慧的容器，所以热和光，或爱和智慧没有任何成分细小到没有这两种层级在里面。<br><br>天使还声明，情感的最小元素和思维的最小元素，甚至一个思维观念的最小元素也都由这两种层级构成，非由这些层级构成的任何细微元素实际上并不存在。因为它没有任何形式，因而没有任何品质，也没有变化多样、通过这种方式得以存在的状态。<br><br>天使通过以下真理证实了这一点：神造物主，即永恒之主里面的无限元素是有区别的一体；祂的无限元素里面又有无限元素；无限的无限元素里面就有这两种层级，祂里面的这些层级也是有区别的一体。此外，由于这些元素在祂里面，一切事物皆由祂所造，并且受造物以某种形像重现了祂里面的元素，所以可推知，没有这些层级在里面的最小有限形式是不存在的。这两些层级同等地存在于最小和最大的受造物中，因为神性在最大和最小事物上是一样的。神-人内的无限事物是有区别的一体(参看17－22节)；神性在最大和最小事物上是一样的(77－82节)；这些要点进一步得以说明(155,169,171节)。</p>

223. Angelic pronouncements on the subject are as follows. There is no thing so small that it does not contain levels of both kinds--not the smallest thing in any animal, not the smallest thing in any plant, not the smallest thing in any mineral, not the smallest thing in the ether or the air. Further, since the ether and air are vessels of warmth and light, this holds for the smallest trace of warmth and light, and since spiritual warmth and spiritual light are vessels of love and wisdom, there is not the smallest bit of these in which there are not levels of both kinds.<p>Another pronouncement of angels is that every least bit of desire, every least bit of thought, even every least bit of a mental image, is made up of levels of both kinds, and that any least thing that is not made up of these levels is actually nothing. It has no form, so it has no characteristics, no state that can shift and change so that it becomes manifest.<p>Angels support this by the truth that the infinite things in God the Creator, who is the Lord from eternity, are "distinguishably one," with infinite things within those infinite things of his and levels of both kinds within those infinitely infinite things that are also distinguishably one in him. Since these are within him, then, and since everything was created by him and everything so created offers a kind of image of what is within him, it follows that there is not the smallest finite thing that does not have these levels in it. The reason these levels are in the smallest and the largest things alike is that Divinity is the same in the largest and smallest things.<p>On infinite things being distinguishably one in the Divine-Human One, see <a href="17.htm" target=_top>17-22</a> above; and on Divinity being the same in the largest and smallest things, <a href="77.htm" target=_top>77-82</a>. There are further examples in <a href="155.htm" target=_top>155</a>, <a href="169.htm" target=_top>169</a>, and <a href="171.htm" target=_top>171</a>. </p>

<p>223. The declarations of angels on this subject are as follows: There is nothing so infinitesimal, they say, as not to have in it degrees of both kinds. Not the least constituent in any animal, for example, not the least constituent in any plant, nor the least constituent in any mineral, and not the least constituent in the ether and air. Moreover, because the ether and air are vehicles of heat and light, there is not the least constituent of these that does not have in it degrees of both kinds; and because spiritual heat and spiritual light are vehicles of love and wisdom, there is not the least constituent of these either that does not have in it both such degrees.<p> </p>
<p>[2] I have it from the declarations of angels also that the least element of affection, and the least element of thought - indeed, the least element of any idea in the thought - consists of degrees of both kinds, and that any least element which does not consist of these does not actually exist. For it has no form, thus no quality, neither any state which can be changed and varied and so come into being.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Angels confirm this by the following truth, that the infinite elements in God the Creator, who is the Lord from eternity, are, in a distinct combination, one; that there are infinite elements in His infinite elements; and that in the infinitely infinite elements are degrees of both kinds, degrees which in Him are also in a distinct combination one. Moreover, because He has these elements in Him, and all things were created by Him, and what He has created exhibits in some image of them the elements that are in Him, it follows that there is not the least finite form which does not have in it such degrees.<p>These degrees exist alike in the least and greatest of created things for the reason that the Divine in the greatest and least of things is the same.<p>That the infinite elements in the human God are, in a distinct combination, one, may be seen above in nos. <a href="17.htm">17-22</a>, and that the Divine in the greatest and least of things is the same, in nos. <a href="77.htm">77-82</a>, points which were further illustrated in nos. <a href="155.htm">155</a>, <a href="169.htm">169</a>, and <a href="171.htm">171</a>. </p>

<p>223. The utterances of angels concerning this subject are as follows:- there can be nothing so minute as not to have in it degrees of both kinds: for example, there can be nothing so minute in any animal, or in any vegetable, or in any mineral, or in the ether and the air as not to have in it these degrees. And because ether and air are receptacles of heat and light, there can be nothing so minute as not to have the least thing of heat and light; and because spiritual heat and light are the receptacles of love and wisdom, there can be nothing of these so minute, as not to have in it degrees of both kinds. From utterances of the angels it is also declared that the least thing of affection or of thought, indeed the least thing of an idea of thought, consists of degrees of both kinds, and that the least thing not consisting of these degrees is nothing. For it has no form, thus no quality, and no state which can be changed and varied, and by this have existence. Angels confirm this by the truth that infinite things in God the Creator, Who is the Lord from eternity, are one distinctly, and that there are infinite things in His infinites, and that in things infinitely infinite, there are degrees of both kinds which also in Him are one distinctly. And because those things are in Him, and all things were created by Him, and created things repeat in a certain image the things which are in Him, it follows that there cannot be the least finite in which there are not such degrees. It is because the Divine is the same in greatest and in least things that these degrees are equally in least and in greatest things. That in God-Man infinite things are one distinctly, may be seen above (<a href="17.htm">17-22</a>); and that the Divine is the same in greatest and in least things (<a href="77.htm">77-82</a>); which facts are further illustrated (<a href="155.htm">155</a>, <a href="169.htm">169</a>, <a href="171.htm">171</a>). </p>

223. The statements of angels on this subject are as follows: There can be nothing so minute as not to have in it degrees of both kinds; for instance, there can be nothing so minute in any animal, or in any plant, or in any mineral, or in the ether or air, as not to have in it degrees of both kinds, and since ether and air are receptacles of heat and light, and spiritual heat and spiritual light are the receptacles of love and wisdom, there can be nothing of heat and light or of love and wisdom so minute as not to have in it degrees of both kinds. Angels also declare that the minutest thing of an affection and the minutest thing of a thought, nay, the minutest thing of an idea of thought, consists of degrees of both kinds, and that a minute thing not consisting of these degrees would be nothing; for it would have no form, thus no quality, nor any state which could be changed and varied, and by this means have existence. Angels confirm this by the truth, that infinite things in God the Creator, who is the Lord from eternity, are one distinctly; and that there are infinite things in His infinites; and that in things infinitely infinite there are degrees of both kinds, which also in Him are one distinctly; and because these things are in Him, and all things were created by Him, and things created repeat in an image the things which are in Him, it follows that there cannot be the least finite in which there are not such degrees. These degrees are equally in things least and greatest, because the Divine is the same in things greatest and in things least. That in God-Man infinite things are one distinctly, see above (n. <a href="17.htm" target=_top>17-22</a>); and that the Divine is the same in things greatest and in things least (n. <a href="77.htm" target=_top>77-82</a>); which positions are further illustrated (n. <a href="155.htm" target=_top>155</a>, <a href="169.htm" target=_top>169</a>, <a href="171.htm" target=_top>171</a>). </p>

<p>223. Angelorum effata de hac re sunt haec: quod non detur tam minimum, in quo non sint gradus utriusque generis; ut, non minimum in aliquo animali; non minimum in aliquo vegetabili; nec minimum in aliquo minerali; nec minimum in aethere et aere; et quia aether et aer sunt receptacula caloris et lucis, quod non detur minimum caloris et lucis; et quia calor spiritualis et lux spiritualis sunt receptacula amoris et sapientiae, quod nec detur minimum horum, in quibus non utriusque generis gradus sunt.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Ex Angelorum effatis etiam est, quod minimum affectionis, ac minimum cogitationis, imo quod minimum ideae cogitationis, consistat ex utriusque generis gradibus, et quod minimum, quod non ex illis consistit, sit nihil; non enim habet formam, ita non quale, nec aliquem statum qui mutari et variari potest, et per id existere.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Angeli confirmant id per hoc verum, quod Infinita in Deo Creatore, <sup>1</sup>
qui est Dominus ab aeterno, distincte unum sint, ac quod infinita in infinitis Ipsius, et quod in infinite infinitis sint gradus utriusque generis, qui etiam in Ipso distincte unum sunt; et quia illa in Ipso sunt, et ab Ipso omnia creata sunt, et quae creata sunt, in quadam imagine referunt illa <sup>2</sup>
quae in Ipso sunt, sequitur quod non detur minimum finitum, in quo non tales gradus sunt. Quod illi gradus aeque in minimis ac in maximis sint, est quia Divinum in <sup>3</sup>
maximis et minimis est idem. Quod in Deo Homine infinita distincte unum sint, videatur supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_223/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_17" target=_top>17-22</a>; et quod Divinum in maximis et minimis sit idem, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_223/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_77" target=_top>77-82</a>; quae adhuc illustrata sunt, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_223/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_155" target=_top>155</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_223/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_169" target=_top>169</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_223/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_171" target=_top>171</a>. <p>
