<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">2.15 自然界的太阳纯粹是火，因而是死的；自然界也是死的，因为它起源于这太阳</h4><p>157、创造本身丝毫不能归因于自然界的太阳，而要完全归因于灵界的太阳，因为自然界的太阳是死的，而灵界的太阳是活的。事实上，它是神性之爱与神性智慧的首先发出。死物凭自己根本不起作用，只是被作用。所以将任何创造物归因于它，就好比将工匠所做的作品归因于他手作工所用的工具。自然界的太阳纯粹是火，生命的一切从中退离；而灵界的太阳是有神性生命在其中的火。天使对自然界太阳之火和灵界太阳之火的观念乃是这样：灵界太阳的火有神性生命在里面，而自然界太阳的火没有。由此可见，自然界太阳的活动并非来自它自己，而是来自从灵界太阳发出的活力。因此，如果灵界太阳的活力退离或被拿走，自然界的太阳就会崩溃。正因如此，拜太阳是最低级的拜神形式，因为这种行为完全是死的，就像这太阳本身是死的一样；因此在圣言中，拜日头被视为可憎恶的事。</p>

157. The physical world's sun is nothing but fire and is therefore dead; and since nature has its origin in that sun, nature is dead. In no respect whatever can creation itself be attributed to the physical world's sun: it is due entirely to the spiritual world's sun. This is because the physical world's sun is totally lifeless, while the spiritual world's sun is alive, being the first emanation of divine love and wisdom. Anything that is lifeless does not effect anything on its own, but is activated; so to attribute any aspect of creation to a lifeless sun would be to attribute the work of an artisan to the tool in the artisan's hand.<p>The physical world's sun is nothing but fire, with all its life removed. The spiritual world's sun is a fire that has divine life within it.<p>The angelic concept of the fire of the physical world's sun and the fire of the spiritual world's sun is like this: divine life is internal to the fire of the spiritual world's sun and external to the fire of the physical world's sun. We can see from this that the activity of our physical sun is not autonomous but stems from a living force that emanates from the spiritual world's sun. Consequently, if the living force of that sun were withdrawn or removed, our sun would fail. This is why the worship of the sun is the lowest of all forms of worship of God. It is just as dead as the sun itself; so in the Word it is called an abomination. </p>

157. The sun in the natural world is nothing but fire and consequently lifeless, and because nature takes its origin from that sun, it too is lifeless. Creation itself cannot in the least be ascribed to the sun of the natural world, but must be ascribed wholly to the sun of the spiritual world, since the sun in the natural world is completely lifeless, while the sun in the spiritual world is alive, being the first emanation of Divine love and wisdom; and something that is lifeless does not do anything by itself, but as the result of some other agency. Consequently to ascribe to it any responsibility for creation would be like ascribing to the tool wielded in the hands of an artisan the work which the artisan accomplishes.<p>The sun in the natural world is sheer fire from which every particle of life has been withdrawn. In contrast, the sun in the spiritual world is fire which has in it Divine life.<p>The idea angels have of the fire of the sun in the natural world and of the fire of the sun in the spiritual world is this - that the Divine life is present inwardly in the fire of the sun in the spiritual world, but outwardly in the fire of the sun in the natural world.<p>It can be seen from this that the activity of the natural sun comes not from itself, but from a living force emanating from the sun of the spiritual world. Consequently if the living force of that sun were to be withdrawn or removed, the natural sun would collapse.<p>It is owing to this that worship of the sun is, of all the forms of worshiping God, the lowest, for it is altogether as lifeless as the sun itself. Therefore such worship is called in the Word an abomination. <sup>1</sup>

157. THE SUN OF THE NATURAL WORLD IS PURE FIRE, AND THEREFORE DEAD; AND NATURE, BECAUSE IT DERIVES ITS ORIGIN FROM THAT SUN, IS DEAD <p>Creation itself cannot be ascribed in the least to the sun of the natural world, but entirely to the Sun of the spiritual world, because the sun of the natural world is quite dead, but the Sun of the spiritual world is living. For it is the first Proceeding of the Divine Love and Wisdom. And that which is dead does not act at all from itself, but is acted upon. Wherefore to ascribe to it anything of creation, would be like ascribing the work that a craftsman makes to the implement which he works with his hands. The sun of the natural world is pure fire, from which everything of life has been withdrawn; whereas the Sun of the spiritual world is fire in which is Divine Life. The angelic idea of the fire of the sun of the natural world, and of the fire of the Sun of the spiritual world is this; in the fire of the Sun of the spiritual world the Divine Life is within, but in the sun of the natural world it is without. From this it can be seen that the actuality of the natural sun is not from itself, but from a living force proceeding from the Sun of the spiritual world. Wherefore if the living force of that Sun were withdrawn or taken away, the natural sun would collapse. Hence it is that the worship of the sun is the lowest of all forms of worship of God, for it is utterly dead as the sun itself is, and so that worship is called in the Word an abomination. </p>

157. THE SUN OF THE NATURAL WORLD IS PURE FIRE, CONSEQUENTLY DEAD; NATURE ALSO IS DEAD, BECAUSE IT DERIVES ITS ORIGIN FROM THAT SUN. <p>Creation itself cannot be ascribed in the least to the sun of the natural world, but must be wholly ascribed to the sun of the spiritual world; because the sun of the natural world is altogether dead; but the sun of the spiritual world is living; for it is the first proceeding of Divine Love and Divine Wisdom; and what is dead does not act at all from itself, but is acted upon; consequently to ascribe to it anything of creation would be like ascribing the work of an artificer to the tool which is moved by his hands. The sun of the natural world is pure fire from which everything of life has been withdrawn; but the sun of the spiritual world is fire in which is Divine Life. The angelic idea of the fire of the sun of the natural world, and of the fire of the sun of the spiritual world, is this; that in the fire of the sun of the spiritual world the Divine Life is within, but in the fire of the sun of the natural world it is without. From this it can be seen that the actuating power of the natural sun is not from itself, but from a living force proceeding from the sun of the spiritual world; consequently if the living force of that sun were withdrawn or taken away, the natural sun would have no vital power. For this reason the worship of the sun is the lowest of all the forms of God-worship, for it is wholly dead, as the sun itself is, and therefore in the Word it is called "abomination." </p>

157. QUOD SOL MUNDI NATURALIS SIT PURUS IGNIS, ET INDE MORTUUS, ET QUOD NATURA, QUIA EX ILLO SOLE DUCIT ORIGINEM, SIT MORTUA. Ipsa Creatio ne hilum potest adscribi Soli Mundi naturalis, sed omnis Soli Mundi spiritualis, <sup>1</sup>
quoniam Sol Mundi naturalis est plane mortuus, at Sol Mundi spiritualis est vivus, est enim primum Procedens Divini Amoris et Divinae Sapientiae; et quod mortuum est, non agit quicquam a se, sed agitur; quare adscribere illi aliquid creationis, foret sicut adscribere instrumento, quod per manus artificis agitur, opus quod Artifex facit. Est Sol Mundi naturalis purus Ignis, a quo omne vitae abstractum est; at Sol Mundi spiritualis est Ignis in quo Vita Divina est. Idea Angelica de Igne Solis Mundi naturalis, et de Igne Solis Mundi spiritualis, est haec; quod Vita Divina sit intus in Igne Solis Mundi spiritualis, at extus in Igne Solis Mundi naturalis. Ex eo videri potest, quod actualitas Solis naturalis non sit a se, sed a vi viva procedente a Sole Mundi spiritualis; quare si vis viva hujus Solis retraheretur seu auferretur, Sol ille collaberetur. Inde est, quod cultus Solis sit omnium cultuum Dei infimus, est enim prorsus mortuus sicut ipse Sol; quare ille cultus in Verbo vocatur abominatio. <p>
