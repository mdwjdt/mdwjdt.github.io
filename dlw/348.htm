<h4 align="center"></h4><p>348、一切功用，无论善恶，皆来自一个属灵的源头，因而来自主所在的太阳，这一点可通过以下经历来说明。我听说，良善和真理被主通过天堂送下地狱；在通过层级，直到在深渊被接受的过程中，这些良善和真理被转变为邪恶和虚假，也就是被送下来的良善和真理的对立面。出现这种情况是因为，所流入的一切事物都是照着接受它们的容器或形式而转变为与其容器或形式相一致的那类事物，正如太阳的白光照进其内在物质具有掐灭和熄灭这光的形式的物体中，会转变为丑陋的颜色或黑色；又如同太阳的热被沼泽、粪堆和死尸转变为恶臭。由此可见，甚至恶用也来自属灵的太阳，但那是善用在地狱被转变成了恶用。因此，很明显，无论过去、现在还是将来，主都不创造除善用以外的任何东西；而地狱只产生恶用。</p>

348. An example may illustrate the fact that both good and evil functions have a spiritual origin, namely the sun where the Lord is. I heard that some good and true gifts had been let down by the Lord through the heavens to hell, and that as they were accepted step by step, all the way to the lowest level of hell, they were turned into the evil and false things that were opposite to the good and true gifts. The reason this happened was that the recipient subjects turn everything that flows in into things that agree with their own forms, just as the pure light of the sun becomes offensive colors or blackness in objects whose inner substances are in the sort of form that stifles light and extinguishes it, and just as swamps, manure piles, and corpses turn the sun's warmth into stenches.<p>We can tell from this that even evil functions come from the spiritual sun, but [they are] good functions turned into evil ones in hell. This shows that the Lord has not created and does not create anything but good functions, while hell brings forth the evil ones. </p>

348. All forms of use, both good and evil, come from a spiritual origin, thus from the sun where the Lord is, and this may be clarified by the following experience. I was told that goods and truths were sent down through the heavens by the Lord to the hells, and that on being received through their degrees to the deepest of them there, these same goods and truths were turned into evils and falsities opposite in character to the goods and truths sent down.<p>This occurred for the reason that everything that flows in is turned by its recipient vessels into such things as accord with their forms, just as the white light of the sun is turned into hideous colors and into blackness in objects whose substances are inwardly in such a form as to snuff out and extinguish the light, and as the sun's warmth is turned by swamps, excrement and dead bodies into foul odors.<p>It can be seen from this that even evil forms of use come from the spiritual sun, but that they are good forms of use turned into evil ones in hell.<p>It is apparent, therefore, that the Lord did not and does not create anything but good forms of use, while hell produces evil ones. </p>

348. That all uses, both good and evil, are from a spiritual origin, thus from the Sun where the Lord is, can be illustrated by this experience. I have heard that goods and truths have been sent down through the heavens from the Lord to the hells, and that these same things received by degrees in the abyss were there turned into evils and falsities, the opposites of the goods and truths sent down. The reason for such a change was that recipient subjects turn all things that inflow into such things as agree with their own forms, just as brilliant sunshine is turned into hideous colours and into black in those objects whose substances are inwardly of such a form as to suffocate and extinguish the light; and stagnant pools, dung hills and dead bodies turn the heat of the sun into stenches. From these things it can be established that evil uses also are from the spiritual Sun, but that good uses are changed in hell into evil uses. It is clear, therefore, that the Lord has not created and does not create any except good uses, and that hell produces evil uses. </p>

348. That all uses, both good and evil, are from a spiritual origin, thus from the sun where the Lord is, may be illustrated by this experience. I have heard that goods and truths have been sent down through the heavens by the Lord to the hells, and that these same, received by degrees to the lowest deep, were there turned into evils and falsities, which are the opposite of the goods and truths sent down. This took place because recipient subjects turn all things that inflow into such things as are in agreement with their own forms, just as the white light of the sun is turned into ugly colors or into black in those objects whose substances are interiorly of such a form as to suffocate and extinguish the light, and as stagnant ponds, dung-hills, and dead bodies turn the heat of the sun into stenches. From all this it can be seen that even evil uses are from the spiritual sun, but that good uses are changed in hell into evil uses. It is evident, therefore, that the Lord has not created and does not create any except good uses, but that hell produces evil uses. </p>

348. Quod omnes usus tam boni quam mali sint ex origine spirituali, ita a Sole ubi Dominus, illustrari potest per hanc experientiam; audivi quod bona et vera demissa sint per Coelos a Domino ad Inferna, et quod eadem illa recepta per gradus ad profundum ibi versa sint in mala et falsa bonis et veris demissis opposita: quod ita factum sit, fuit causa, quia subjecta recipientia vertunt omnia quae influunt in talia quae congruunt formis suis, prorsus sicut candida lux Solis vertitur in colores tetros, et in nigrum, in objectis quorum substantiae interius in tali forma sunt, ut lucem suffocent et exstinguant; <sup>1</sup>
et quod stagna, stercora et cadavera vertant calorem solis in putores. Ex his constare potest, quod etiam mali usus sint a Sole spirituali, sed quod boni usus in malos in inferno convertantur. Inde patet, quod Dominus non creaverit et creet nisi quam bonos usus, sed quod infernum producat malos. <p>
