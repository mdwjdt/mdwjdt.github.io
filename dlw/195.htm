<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">3.5 最初层级是随后层级全部中的全部</h4><p>195、这是因为一切容器和一切事物的层级都是同质的；它们因由最初层级产生而为同质。它们的形成乃是这样：第一层级，通过捆扎或组合，总之通过各部分的聚合，产生第二层级，然后通过第二层级产生第三层级；并且各自通过包裹它的包裹物而与其它层级区别开来。由此明显可知，最初层级在随后层级中是首要和唯一掌控者；因此，最初层级是随后层级全部中的全部。</p>

195. The first level is the sum and substance of all the levels. This is because the levels of every subject and every object are matched in kind, and they are matched in kind because they have been produced by the first level. The way they are formed is that the first level produces a second by folding together or congregating--in short, by gathering; and through this second level, it produces a third. Further, it marks each level off from the other by a surrounding membrane. We can see from this that the first level is in primary and sole control of the subsequent ones, and that in fact the first level is the sum and substance of all the levels. </p>

195. The first degree is the all in all things of the subsequent degrees. The reason is that the degrees in every vessel and in every phenomenon are homogeneous; and they are homogeneous because they come into being from the first degree. For their formation is such that the first element by bundlings or conglomerations, in a word, by aggregations, produces the second, and through that the third; and it keeps each distinct from the other by enveloping it in a covering.<p>It is apparent from this that the first degree is the principal and only governing one in those that follow; consequently, that the first degree is the all in all things of the subsequent degrees. </p>

195. THE FIRST DEGREE IS THE ALL IN ALL OF SUBSEQUENT DEGREES <p>The reason for this is that the degrees of each subject and of each thing are homogeneous, and they are homogeneous because produced by the first degree. For their formation is such that the first, by combinations and accretions, in a word, by massing together [of parts] produces the second, and through this, the third, and discretes each from the other by a covering drawn around it. Hence it is clear that the first degree is chief and solely regnant in subsequent degrees, consequently that the first degree is the all in all of subsequent degrees. </p>

195. THE FIRST DEGREE IS THE ALL IN EVERYTHING OF THE SUBSEQUENT DEGREES. <p>This is because the degrees of each subject and of each thing are homogeneous; and they are homogeneous because produced from the first degree. For their formation is such that the first, by bundlings or groupings, in a word, by aggregations of parts, produces the second, and through this the third; and discretes each from the other by a covering drawn around it; from which it is clear that the first degree is chief and singly supreme in the subsequent degrees; consequently that in all things of the subsequent degrees, the first is the all. </p>

195. QUOD GRADUS PRIMUS SIT OMNE IN OMNIBUS GRADUUM SEQUENTIUM: causa est, quia Gradus cujusvis subjecti et cujusvis rei homogenei sunt; ac homogenei sunt, quia producti a gradu primo: nam formatio illorum talis est, quod primum per confasciculationes <sup>1</sup>
aut conglobationes, verbo, per congregationes, producat alterum, et per hoc tertium; ac unumquodvis discernit ab altero per circumductum velamen: Inde patet, quod primus gradus sit principalis ac unice regnans in sequentibus; proinde quod primus gradus sit omne in omnibus graduum sequentium. <p>
