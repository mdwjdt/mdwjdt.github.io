<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第43节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>43、综上所述，我们初次明白，神性之爱与神性智慧本身就是物质与形式，因为它们是真正的存在与显现；它们若不是这种存在与显现，以至于是物质与形式，就只是一种想象的产物，而该事物本身什么也不是。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #43 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
43. This brings us to the point where we can see that divine love and wisdom in and of themselves are substance and form. They are essential reality and manifestation, and unless they were as much reality and manifestation as they are substance and form, they would be only theoretical constructs that in and of themselves are nothing. </p>


<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #43 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
43. From the foregoing it can now for the first time be seen that Divine love and wisdom in themselves are substance and form, for they are being and expression itself; and that if they were not such a being and expression as to be substance and form, they would be only a figment of the imagination, which in itself is not anything. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #43 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
43. From these things it can first be seen that Divine Love and Wisdom in themselves are substance and form, for they are very Esse and Existere. And unless they were such Esse and Existere as they are substance and form, they would be merely a figment of the imagination which in itself is not anything. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #43 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
43. From all this it may now first be seen that Divine Love and Divine Wisdom in themselves are substance and form; for they are very Esse and Existere; and unless they were such Esse and Existere as they are substance and form, they would be a mere thing of reasoning, which in itself is nothing. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #43 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
43. Ex his primum potest videri, quod Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia in se sint Substantia et Forma, sunt enim ipsum Esse et Existere, et nisi forent tale Esse et Existere sicut sunt substantia et forma, forent modo ens rationis, quod in se non est aliquid. </p>
