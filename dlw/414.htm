<h4 align="center"></h4><p>414、(14)爱或意愿同样能被提升，也能感知诸如出于天堂属于热的那类事物，只要它热爱在同一层级的配偶。我们在前一章和前面多处已经说明，理解力能被提升到天堂之光，并从这光汲取智慧。此外，我们在前面多处还说明，爱或意愿也能被提升，只要它热爱那些属于天堂之光或属于智慧的事物。然而，爱或意愿无法通过作为目的的任何名誉、荣耀或利益而被如此提升，只能通过对功用的一种爱，因而不是为了自己，而是为了邻舍而被提升。<br><br>由于唯独主出于天堂赐下这种爱，并且当人避恶如罪时，主就会赐下它，所以爱或意愿能通过这些方法被提升，没有这些方法则不能。但爱或意愿被提升到天堂之热，而理解力被提升到天堂之光。当两者都被提升时，两者的一个婚姻就会在那里进行，该婚姻被称为天上的婚姻，因为它是天上的爱与智慧的婚姻。这就是为何我们说，爱若热爱其在同一层级的智慧，就是它的配偶，也会被提升。智慧之爱，也就是适合人类理解力的真正的爱，就是来自主的对邻之爱。这和世上的光、热是一样的。光有热无热都可存在；光在冬天是没有热的，在夏天是有热的；当热和光共存时，万物就会繁衍生息。人里面的光若对应于冬天的光，就是没有爱的智慧；若对应于夏天的光，就是有爱的智慧。</p>

414, 14. Love or volition can be raised up in the same way and can grasp things in heaven's warmth provided it loves its spouse, wisdom, to that degree. I have explained in the preceding section (and often enough before that) that our discernment can be raised into heaven's light and gather in wisdom from it. I have also frequently noted that our love or volition can be raised up as well if it loves the things that are found in heaven's light, things that involve wisdom. However, our love or volition is not raised up by any concern for promotion, praise, or profit, but by a love of service--that is, not for our own sake but for the sake of our neighbor. Since this love is granted us only from heaven by the Lord, and since the Lord gives it to us when we abstain from evils as sins, this is how our love or volition can be lifted up as well; otherwise it cannot happen. Love or volition, though, is raised into heaven's warmth, while discernment is raised into heaven's light. If they are both raised up, a marriage takes place there that we call "the heavenly marriage" because it is a marriage of wisdom and heavenly love. This is why I said that love is raised as well if it loves wisdom, its spouse, to that degree. A love for our neighbor that comes from the Lord is a love for wisdom, or the human mind's real love.<p>The same thing is true of light and warmth in the world. There is light without warmth and there is light with warmth--without warmth in winter and with warmth in summer. When there is light with warmth, then everything blooms. The light in us that answers to winter light is wisdom apart from its love, and the light in us that answers to summer light is wisdom together with its love. </p>

414. (14) Love or the will can be similarly elevated and admit from heaven such matters as are matters of warmth if it loves its partner in the same degree. We have already shown in the preceding discussion and here and there above that the intellect can be elevated into the light of heaven and draw from it wisdom. Moreover, we have also shown here and there that love or the will can be equally elevated, if it loves such matters as are matters of the light of heaven, or matters of wisdom. However, love or the will cannot be elevated by any measure of honor, glory or material gain as its end, but by a love of useful service, not so much for its own sake, but for the sake of the neighbor. And because this love is bestowed only from heaven by the Lord, and is bestowed by the Lord when a person refrains from evils as being sins, therefore it is by these means that love or the will can be elevated also, and apart from these means it cannot be.<p>The will's love, however, is elevated into the warmth of heaven, whereas the intellect is elevated into the light of heaven, and if both are elevated, a marriage of the two takes place there, which we call the heavenly marriage, because it is a marriage of heavenly love and wisdom. That is why we say that love is elevated also if it loves its partner wisdom in the same degree. Love for the neighbor from the Lord is the love proper to wisdom, or the genuine love proper to the human intellect.<p>The case is the same as with light and warmth in the world. Light is possible without warmth, and possible in conjunction with warmth. It is without warmth in wintertime, and accompanied by warmth in summertime; and when warmth exists in conjunction with light, then all things flourish. The light in a person corresponding to the light of winter is wisdom without its love, while the light in a person corresponding to the light of summer is wisdom accompanied by its love. </p>

414. (xiv) Love or the will can be elevated in like manner and can receive such things as are of heat out of heaven, provided it loves wisdom, its partner, in that degree. It was shown in the preceding number and in many places above that the understanding can be elevated into the light of heaven, and from it can draw forth wisdom; but it has also been frequently shown that love or the will can be elevated in like manner if it loves things that belong to the light of heaven, or to wisdom. Yet love or the will cannot be elevated through anything of honour, glory, or gain, as an end, but through a love of use, thus not for the sake of self, but for the sake of the neighbour; and because this love is given only by the Lord when man shuns evils as sins, therefore love or the will can be raised by this means and in no other way. Love or the will is elevated into heaven's heat, the understanding, however, into its light; and if both be raised, their marriage is celebrated there, and is called a heavenly marriage, because it is a marriage of heavenly love and wisdom; consequently it is said that love also is elevated if it loves wisdom, its partner, in that degree. The love of wisdom, or the genuine love of the human understanding, is love towards the neighbour from the Lord. It is the same with light and heat in the world. Light exists without heat and with heat, the former in winter and the latter in summer. When there is heat with light all things flourish. Light in man corresponding to the light of winter is wisdom without its love, and light in man corresponding to the light of summer is wisdom with its love. </p>

414. (14) Love or the will can in like manner be elevated and can receive such things as are of heat out of heaven provided it loves wisdom, its consort, in that degree. That the understanding can be elevated into the light of heaven, and from that light draw forth wisdom, has been shown in the preceding chapter and in many places above; also that love or the will can be elevated as well, provided it loves those things that are of the light of heaven or that are of wisdom, has also been shown in many places. Yet love or the will cannot be thus elevated through anything of honor, glory, or gain as an end, but only through a love of use, thus not for the sake of self, but for the sake of the neighbor; and because this love is given only by the Lord out of heaven, and is given by the Lord when man flees from evils as sins, therefore it is that love or the will can be elevated by these means, and cannot without these means. But love or the will is elevated into heaven's heat, while the understanding is elevated into its light. When both are elevated, a marriage of the two takes place there, which is called celestial marriage, because it is a marriage of celestial love and wisdom; consequently it is said that love also is elevated if it loves wisdom, its consort, in that degree. The love of wisdom, that is, the genuine love of the human understanding is love towards the neighbor from the Lord. It is the same with light and heat in the world. Light exists without heat and with heat; light is without heat in winter time, and with heat in summer time; and when heat is with light all things flourish. The light with man that corresponds to the light of winter is wisdom without its love; and the light with man that corresponds to the light of summer is wisdom with its love. </p>

414. XIV. Quod Amor seu Voluntas possit similiter elevari, ac recipere illa quae caloris sunt e Coelo, si amat suam conjugem sapientiam, in eo gradu. Quod Intellectus possit elevari in lucem coeli, et ex illa haurire sapientiam, in Articulo antecedente et supra passim ostensum est: quod autem Amor seu Voluntas aeque possit elevari, si amet illa quae lucis coeli, seu quae sapientiae sunt, etiam passim ostensum est; at amor seu voluntas non [possit elevari] per aliquid honoris, gloriae aut lucri ut finem, sed per amorem usus[,] non ita propter se, sed propter proximum; et quia hic amor non datur nisi quam e coelo a Domino, <sup>1</sup>
et datur a Domino cum homo fugit mala ut peccata, ideo per haec media potest amor seu voluntas etiam elevari, et absque his mediis non potest: at amor seu voluntas elevatur in calorem coeli, intellectus autem in lucem coeli, et si uterque elevatur, fit conjugium eorum ibi, quod conjugium coeleste vocatur, quia est amoris coelestis et sapientiae: quare dicitur, quod amor etiam elevetur, si amat sapientiam conjugem suam in eo gradu; amor erga proximum a Domino, est amor sapientiae, seu genuinus amor Intellectus humani. Est hoc simile cum luce et calore in mundo[;] datur lux absque calore, et datur cum calore[;] absque calore datur tempore hyemis, et cum calore tempore aestatis, et cum calor cum luce est, tunc florent omnia; lux apud hominem correspondens luci hyemis est sapientia absque amore ejus, et lux apud hominem correspondens luci aestatis est sapientia cum ejus amore. <p>
