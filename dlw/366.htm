366, 3. The quality of a life in its primary forms determines its quality overall and in every part. For the reader to understand this, I need to say just where these primary forms are in the brains and how they branch off.<p>We can see from anatomy just where these primary forms are in the brain. This tells us that there are two brains and that these have extensions from the head into the spine. It tells us that the brains consist of two substances called the cortical substance and the medullary substance, with the cortical substance consisting of countless little glandlike things and the medullary substance of countless fiberlike things. Since the little glands are at the heads of the little fibers, then, they are also their primary forms. The fibers begin there and they radiate outward, gradually gathering into nerves; and once they have gathered or formed nerves they go down to the sensory organs in the face and the motor organs in the body and form them. Check with anyone versed in the knowledge of anatomy and you will find this to be true.<p>This cortical or glandular substance constitutes the surface of the brain and the surface of the corpora striata that make up the medulla oblongata, to link with the cerebellum and through the cerebellum to the spinal cord. Wherever the medullary or fibrous substance is found, however, it begins and goes from the cortical substance. This is the source of the nerves that all the parts of the body come from. This fact is learned from dissection.<p>If people know this from the science of anatomy or from people versed in that science, they can see that the primary forms of life are nowhere but where the beginnings of the fibers are, and that the fibers cannot radiate from themselves but from the primary forms. The primary forms or beginnings that look like little glands are almost beyond counting. We can compare their abundance to the number of stars in the universe, and the abundance of fibers that come from them to the number of rays that radiate from the stars and bear their warmth and light to the planets.<p>We may also compare the abundance of these little glands to the abundance of angelic communities in the heavens. These too are beyond counting and are similarly arranged, so I have been told; and the abundance of little fibers radiating from these little glands can be compared to the spiritual good and true activities that flow down like rays in much the same way.<p>This is why the individual human being is like a universe and like a heaven in miniature, as I have stated and explained throughout what precedes [19, 186, 203, 231]. We can tell from this that the quality of life in its primary forms determines its quality in secondary forms, or that the quality of life in its beginnings in the brain determines its quality in the things in the body that originate there. </p>

<p>366. (3) As life is in its first elements, so it is in the whole and in every part of that whole. For this to be perceived, we must say where in the brain these first elements are, and how their derivative elements are formed.<p>Where these first elements are in the brain is plain from the study of anatomy. From this study we know that the brain consists of two structures, and that these are continued from the head into the spinal column. We know, too, that these structures consist of two substances, called gray matter and white matter, and that the gray matter consists of countless little gland-like constituents, and the white matter of countless fiber-like ones.<p>Now because these little glandular constituents form the heads of the fibrous ones, they are also their first elements. For fibers commence from them and then continue on, gradually bundling themselves into nerves, and having been bundled together or formed into nerves, they descend to the sense organs in the face and to the motor organs in the body and form them. Consult any expert in the science of anatomy and you will have it confirmed.<p> </p>
<p>[2] The gray matter or glandular substance forms the outer layer of the cerebrum, and the outer layer of the corpora striata as well, from which the medulla oblongata proceeds, and it forms the core of the cerebellum, and also the core of the spinal cord. The white matter or fibrous substance, on the other hand, everywhere commences and continues on from that, and from it issue the nerves, from which arise all the constituents of the body. Anatomical examination shows this to be the case.<p>People who are acquainted with these observations, either from their study of anatomy or from the testimony of others who are engaged in that study, can see that the first elements of life lie nowhere else than where the fibers have their beginnings, and that it is not possible for the fibers to issue forth of themselves, but must do so from those first elements.<p> </p>
<p>[3] These first elements or initial forms which look like little glands are almost beyond number. Their multitude may be likened to the multitude of stars in the universe; and the multitude of little fibers issuing from them may be likened to the multitude of rays emanating from the stars and conveying their heat and light to the planets.<p>The multitude of these little glands may also be likened to the multitude of angelic societies in the heavens, which are also beyond number, and similarly arranged, I have been told; and the multitude of little fibers issuing from those little glands may be likened to the spiritual truths and goods which similarly stream down like rays from those societies.<p>So it is that the human being is a kind of universe, and a kind of heaven in miniature form, as we have said and shown here and there above.<p>It can be seen from this that as life is in its first elements, so it is in its derivative elements, or that as life is in its first forms in the brain, so it is in the forms arising from it in the body. </p>

<p>366. (iii) Such as life is in its beginnings, such it is in the whole and in its every part. In order that this may be perceived, it shall be explained where in the brains those beginnings are, and how they become derivations. Anatomy shows clearly where they exist. It makes known that there are two brains, and that they are continued from the head into the spinal column; that they consist of two substances, called cortical substance and medullary substance; that cortical substance consists of innumerable gland-like forms, and medullary substance of innumerable fibre-like forms. Now as these glands are the heads of fibrils, they are also their beginnings; for the fibres begin and go forth from these glands, and gradually become bundled together into nerves. These bundles or nerves, when formed, descend to the sensory organs in the face, and to the organs of motion in the body, and form them. Consult anyone skilled in the science of anatomy, and you will be convinced. This cortical or glandular substance forms the surface of the cerebrum, and also the surface of the corpora striata, from which comes the medulla oblongata; it also forms the middle of the cerebellum, and the middle of the spinal marrow. But the medullary or fibrillary substances everywhere begin in and proceed from the cortical; and from this come the nerves, and from them all things of the body. That this is true is proved by dissection. They who know these things, either from study of the science of anatomy or from those skilled in it, can see that the beginnings of life are nowhere else than the commencements of the fibres, and that fibres cannot go forth from themselves, but from those beginnings. These beginnings or origins, which appear as glands, are almost countless; their multitude may be compared to the multitude of stars in the universe; and the multitude of fibrils from them can be compared to the multitude of rays going out from the stars and bearing their heat and light to the earths. The multitude of these glands may also be compared to the multitude of angelic societies in the heavens, which also are countless, and, as I have been told, are in the same order; and the multitude of fibrils going out from these glands can be compared to spiritual truths and goods, which in the same way flow down therefrom like rays. Hence it is like a universe and like a heaven in its least form, as has frequently been said and shown above. From these things it can be established that such as life is in beginnings, such it is in derivatives; or, such as life is in its first things in the brains, so is it in the things arising therefrom in the body. </p>

366. (3) Such as life is in its first principles, such it is in the whole and in every part. That this may be perceived, it shall now be told where in the brains these first principles are, and how they become derivative. Anatomy shows where in the brains these first principles are; it teaches that there are two brains; that these are continued from the head into the spinal column; that they consist of two substances, called cortical substance and medullary substance; that cortical substance consists of innumerable gland-like forms, and medullary substance of innumerable fiber-like forms. Now as these little glands are heads of fibrils, they are also their first principles. For from these, fibers begin and thereupon go forth, gradually bundling themselves into nerves. These bundles or nerves, when formed, descend to the organs of sense in the face, and to the organs of motion in the body, and form them. Consult any one skilled in the science of anatomy, and you will be convinced. This cortical or glandular substance constitutes the surface of the cerebrum, and also the surface of the corpora striata, from which proceeds the medulla oblongata; it also constitutes the middle of the cerebellum, and the middle of the spinal marrow. But medullary or fibrillary substance everywhere begins in and proceeds from the cortical; out of it nerves arise, and from them all things of the body. That this is true is proved by dissection. They who know these things, either from the study of anatomical science or from the testimony of those who are skilled in the science, can see that the first principles of life are in the same place as the beginnings of the fibers, and that fibers cannot go forth from themselves, but must go forth from first principles. These first principles, that is, beginnings, which appear as little glands, are almost countless; their multitude may be compared to the multitude of stars in the universe; and the multitude of fibrils coming out of them may be compared to the multitude of rays going forth from the stars and bearing their heat and light to the earth. The multitude of these little glands may also be compared to the multitude of angelic societies in the heavens, which also are countless, and, I have been told, are in like order as the glands. Also the multitude of fibrils going out from these little glands may be compared to the spiritual truths and goods which in like manner flow down from the angelic societies like rays. From this it is that man is like a universe, and like a heaven in least form (as has been frequently said and shown above). From all which it can now be seen that such as life is in first principles, such it is in derivatives; or such as it is in its firsts in the brains, such it is in the things arising therefrom in the body. </p>

<p>366. III. Quod qualis vita est in principiis, talis sit in toto et in qualibet parte ejus. Hoc ut percipiatur, dicetur ubinam illa principia in Cerebris sunt, et quomodo derivantur. Ubinam illa principia in cerebris sunt, patet ex Anatomia; ex hac notum est, quod bina Cerebra sint, et quod illa continuentur a Capite in spinam dorsi; et quod illa consistant ex binis substantiis, quae vocantur substantia corticalis <sup>1</sup>
et substantia medullaris; et quod substantia corticalis consistat ex innumerabilibus quasi <sup>2</sup>
glandulis, et substantia medullaris ex innumerabilibus quasi fibris: nunc quia glandulae illae sunt capita fibrillarum, sunt etiam principia illarum; fibrae enim ex illis inchoant, et deinde procedunt, et successive se confasciant in nervos, ac confasciatae seu nervi factae descendunt ad organa sensoria in facie, et ad organa motoria in corpore, et formant illa: consule aliquem scientiae anatomicae peritum, et confirmaberis.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Substantia illa corticalis seu glandularis facit superficiem cerebri, tum superficiem corporum striatorum, ex quibus Medulla oblongata, et facit medium Cerebelli, et quoque medium Medullae spinalis: substantia autem medullaris seu fibrillaris ubivis inchoat et procedit exinde, et ex hac sunt nervi, ex quibus omnia corporis: quod ita sit, autopsia <sup>3</sup>
docet. Qui haec sciunt <sup>4</sup>
vel ex scientia anatomica, vel ex confirmatione ex illis qui in ea scientia sunt, possunt videre, quod vitae principia non alibi sint, quam ubi sunt initia fibrarum, et quod fibrae non possint ex se, sed ex illis pro cedere.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Sunt principia seu initia illa, quae apparent ut glandulae, paene innumerabilia; multitudo illorum comparari potest multitudini stellarum in universo; et multitudo fibrillarum ex illis comparari potest multitudini radiorum exeuntium e stellis, et [qui] ferunt calorem et lucem illarum in terras. Multitudo glandularum istarum etiam comparari potest multitudini societatum angelicarum in Coelis, quae etiam innumerae sunt, et in simili ordine, ut mihi dictum est, et multitudo fibrillarum exeuntium ex illis glandulis comparari potest spiritualibus veris et bonis, quae similiter sicut radii exinde defluunt. Inde est, quod homo sit sicut universum, et sicut Coelum in minima forma; ut supra passim dictum et ostensum est. <sup>5</sup>
Ex his constare potest, quod qualis vita est in principiis, talis sit in principiatis; seu qualis vita est in suis primis in Cerebris, talis sit in ortis ex illis in Corpore. <p>
