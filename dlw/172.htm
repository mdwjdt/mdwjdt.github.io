<h4 align="center"></h4><p>172、目的、原因和结果这三者存在于每一个受造物中，这一点也可从以下事实看出来：在从首先者，即主造物主，直到最终目的，即人与主的结合的不间断连续过程中，被称为最终目的的一切结果，重新成为最初目的。一切最终目的重新变成最初目的，这从以下事实明显可知：没有什么事物会如此惰性、死气沉沉，以至于里面没有任何有效的能力。甚至连沙子也有诸如在产生并因此影响某物上给予帮助的那种散发物。</p>

172. The presence of this trio of purpose, means, and result in absolutely everything created is evidenced also by the fact that all the results that we call final goals become fresh new goals in an endless series, from the First, who is the Lord the Creator, to the last, which is our union with him. We can see that all final goals become fresh new goals from the fact that there is nothing so lifeless and dead that it has no trace of effectiveness in it. Even from sand there breathes something that provides a resource for accomplishing something, and therefore for having some effect. </p>

172. The existence of these three - end, cause and effect - in each and all things that have been created can also be seen from the fact that all effects, which are called last ends, become anew first ends in unbroken succession extending from their origin, which is the Lord the Creator, to their last, which is the conjunction of mankind with Him.<p>That all last ends become anew first ends is apparent from this, that there is nothing so inert and lifeless that it has in it no capability of producing an effect. Even sand emits an exhalation such that it assists in producing something further, thus in producing an effect. </p>

172. That those three, end, cause and effect are in each and all things that have been created, can also be established from this, that all effects which are called ultimate ends, become anew first ends in continuous series from the First, Who is the Lord the Creator, even to the ultimate which is the conjunction of man with Him. That all last ends become anew first ends is evident from this, that there can be nothing so inert and dead as to have no efficient power in it. Even out of sand there is such an exhalation as gives power to produce, and therefore to effect something. </p>

172. That these three, end, cause, and effect, are in each and every thing created, can also be seen from this, that all effects, which are called last ends, become anew first ends in uninterrupted succession from the First, who is the Lord the Creator, even to the last end, which is the conjunction of man with Him. That all last ends become anew first ends is plain from this, that there can be nothing so inert and dead as to have no efficient power in it. Even out of sand there is such an exhalation as gives aid in producing, and therefore in effecting something. </p>

172. Quod tria illa, Finis, Causa et Effectus[,] sint in omnibus et singulis quae creata sunt, constare etiam potest ex eo, quod omnes effectus, qui vocantur fines ultimi, fiant e novo fines primi in continua serie a Primo, qui est Dominus Creator, usque ad ultimum, qui est conjunctio hominis cum Ipso. Quod omnes fines ultimi e novo fiant fines <sup>1</sup>
primi, patet inde, quod non detur aliquid tale iners et mortuum, ut nihil efficientis sit in illo; etiam ex arena exspirat tale, quod confert opem ad aliquid producendum, ita ad aliquid efficiendum. <p>
