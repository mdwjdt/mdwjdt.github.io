<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第297节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>297、凡以某种光照进行思考的人都能看出，爱以功用为目的并有所打算，它通过智慧产生功用；因为爱本身无法产生功用，唯有通过作为媒介的智慧才行。事实上，若没有某种被爱之物，爱是什么呢？这被爱之物就是功用。由于功用就是那被爱之物，并通过智慧产生，所以可推知，功用是包含爱和智慧的媒介。前面(209-216节，以及别处)已说明，这三要素，即爱、智慧和功用，遵循高度层级的次序，最末或最外在的层级是在先层级的复合物、容器和基础。由此可见，这三者，即爱的神性、智慧的神性和功用的神性在主里面，本质上就是主。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #297 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
297. Anyone who thinks with some enlightenment can see that love has service as its goal, that love tends toward service, and that love brings about service through wisdom. In fact, love cannot accomplish anything useful by itself, only by means of wisdom. After all, what is love unless there is something that is loved? That "something" is service. Service is what is loved; and since it is brought forth by means of wisdom, it follows that service is the vessel of love and wisdom.<p>I explained in <a href="209.htm" target=_top>209-216</a> above (as well as elsewhere) that these three, love, wisdom, and service, follow in sequence by vertical levels, and that the final level is the composite, vessel, and foundation of the preceding levels. It therefore stands to reason that these three elements--elements of divine love, divine wisdom, and divine service--are in the Lord, and in essence are the Lord. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #297 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
297. Everyone who thinks with some enlightenment can see that love has as its end and intends some useful endeavor, and that it produces the useful endeavor through wisdom; for love cannot produce any useful endeavor of itself, but only by means of wisdom. Indeed, what is love unless there is something that is loved? This something is useful endeavor. And because useful endeavor is that which is loved, and it is produced through wisdom, it follows that useful endeavor is the containing medium of love and wisdom.<p>We have already shown in nos. <a href="209.htm">209-216</a> and elsewhere that these three - love, wisdom and useful endeavor - follow in sequence in accordance with degrees of height, and that the last degree embraces, contains, and is the foundation of the prior degrees.<p>It can be seen from this that the aforementioned three elements - the Divine element of love, the Divine element of wisdom, and the Divine element of useful endeavor - are in the Lord, and that in essence they are the Lord. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #297 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
297. Everyone who thinks with any enlightenment can see that love has use for an end, and intends it, and brings it forth by means of wisdom. For love of itself can bring forth no use, but can do so by means of wisdom as a medium. Indeed, what is love unless there is something loved? This something is use, and because use is that which is loved, and is brought forth by means of wisdom, it follows that use is the containant of wisdom and love. It has been shown (<a href="209.htm">209-216</a>, and elsewhere) that these three, love, wisdom and use follow in order according to degrees of altitude, and that the ultimate degree is the complex, containant and base of the prior degrees. From these facts it can be established that these three, the Divine of Love, the Divine of Wisdom, and the Divine of Use are in the Lord, and in essence are the Lord. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #297 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
297. Any one who thinks with any enlightenment can see that love has use for an end and intends it, and brings it forth by means of wisdom; for love can bring forth no use of itself, but only by wisdom as a medium. What, in fact, is love unless there be something loved? That something is use; and because use is that which is loved, and is brought forth by means of wisdom, it follows that use is the containant of wisdom and love. That these three, love, wisdom and use follow in order according to degrees of height, and that the outmost degree is the complex, containant, and base of the prior degrees has been shown (n. <a href="209.htm" target=_top>209-216</a>, and elsewhere). From all this it can be seen that these three, the Divine of Love, the Divine of Wisdom, and the Divine of Use, are in the Lord, and are the Lord in essence. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #297 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
297. Omnis qui in aliqua illustratione cogitat, potest videre, quod amor pro fine habeat ac intendat usum, et quod producat usum per sapientiam; amor enim ex se non aliquem usum potest producere, sed media Sapientia; imo quid est amor, nisi sit aliquid quod amatur[;] hoc aliquid est usus; et quia usus est id quod amatur, et ille producitur per sapientiam, sequitur quod Usus sit continens Sapientiae et Amoris. Quod tria haec, Amor, Sapientia et Usus, sequantur in ordine secundum gradus altitudinis, et quod ultimus gradus sit complexus, continens et basis priorum graduum, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_297/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_209" target=_top>209-216</a>, et alibi, ostensum est. Ex his constare potest, quod tria illa, Divinum amoris, Divinum Sapientiae, et Divinum Usus[,] sint in Domino, et quod sint Dominus in essentia. </p>
