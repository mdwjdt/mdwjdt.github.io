<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">3.11 主里面的三个高度层级是无限和非受造的，而人里面的这三个层级是有限和受造的</h4><p>230、主里面的三个高度层级是无限和非受造的，因为主是爱本身和智慧本身(如前所示)；主因是爱本身和智慧本身，故也是功用本身。因为爱以功用为它的目的，并通过智慧产生功用。事实上，没有功用，爱和智慧就没有边界或终点，也就是说，没有自己的家或住所。因此，若没有爱和智慧可以居于其中，或表达它们的功用，它们就谈不上有存在和形式。这三者构成生命主体里面的三个高度层级，就像最初目的，被称为原因的中间目的和被称为结果的最终目的。目的、原因和结果构成三个高度层级，对此，我们已在前文予以说明和详细论证。</p>

230. There are three infinite and uncreated vertical levels in the Lord, and three finite and created levels in us. The reason there are three infinite and uncreated vertical levels in the Lord is that the Lord is love itself and wisdom itself, as explained above [<a href="28.htm" target=_top>28-33</a>]. Since the Lord is love itself and wisdom itself, he is also usefulness itself, since love has useful functions as its goal and puts them into effect by means of wisdom. Apart from usefulness, love and wisdom have no definition or boundary, no dwelling. This means that we cannot say they exist or are present unless there is a useful function in which they occur.<p>These three elements constitute three vertical levels in agents of life. These three are like the first end, the intermediate end that we refer to as the means, and the ultimate end that we refer to as the result. I have already [167-169, 184] explained and amply documented the fact that purpose, means, and result constitute three vertical levels. </p>

230. There are three infinite and uncreated degrees of height in the Lord, and three finite and created degrees in people. There are in the Lord three infinite and uncreated degrees of height for the reason that the Lord is love itself and wisdom itself, as we have shown in previous discussions; and because the Lord is love itself and wisdom itself, therefore He is also useful endeavor itself. For love has as its end a useful result, which it produces through wisdom. Indeed, love and wisdom without a useful result have no terminus or end point, or no resting place in which to make their abode. Consequently they cannot be said to have being or expression without having a useful result in which to be and express themselves.<p>These three elements constitute the three degrees of height in living entities. The three are analogous to the first end, the intermediate end, which we call the cause, and the last end, which we call the effect. The fact that end, cause and effect constitute three degrees of height is something we have already shown and confirmed many times. </p>

230. IN THE LORD THE THREE DEGREES OF HEIGHT ARE INFINITE AND UNCREATE, BUT IN MAN THE THREE DEGREES ARE FINITE AND CREATED <p>In the Lord the three degrees of height are infinite and uncreate, because the Lord is Love Itself and Wisdom Itself, as was shown in preceding pages. And because the Lord is Love Itself and Wisdom Itself. He is also Use Itself. For love has use as its end, which it brings forth by wisdom. For without use, love and wisdom have no boundary or end, that is, no dwelling-place of their own. Consequently, it cannot be said that they have being and existence unless there be use in which they are. These three constitute the three degrees of height in subjects of life. These three are like first end, middle end which is called cause, and ultimate end which is called effect. That end, cause and effect constitute the three degrees of height has been shown above and confirmed by many things. </p>

230. IN THE LORD THE THREE DEGREES OF HEIGHT ARE INFINITE AND UNCREATE, BUT IN MAN THE THREE DEGREES ARE FINITE AND CREATED. <p>In the Lord the three degrees of height are infinite and uncreate, because the Lord is Love itself and Wisdom itself (as has been already shown); and because the Lord is Love itself and Wisdom itself, He is also Use itself. For love has use for its end, and brings forth use by means of wisdom; for without use love and wisdom have no boundary or end, that is, no home of their own, consequently they cannot be said to have being and have form unless there be use in which they may be. These three constitute the three degrees of height in subjects of life. These three are like first end, middle end which is called cause, and last end which is called effect. That end, cause and effect constitute the three degrees of height has been shown above and abundantly proved. </p>

230. QUOD TRES GRADUS ALTITUDINIS INFINITI ET INCREATI <sup>1</sup>
SINT IN DOMINO, ET QUOD TRES GRADUS FINITI ET CREATI SINT IN HOMINE. Quod in Domino tres gradus altitudinis infiniti et increati sint, est quia Dominus est Ipse Amor et Ipsa Sapientia, ut in antecedentibus demonstratum est; et quia Dominus est Ipse Amor et Ipsa Sapientia, ideo quoque est Ipse Usus; nam Amor pro fine habet usum, quem producit per sapientiam; amor enim et Sapientia absque usu non habent terminum aut finem, seu non habent suum domicilium; quapropter non potest dici quod sint et existant, nisi sit usus in quo. <sup>2</sup>
Haec tria constituunt tres <sup>3</sup>
gradus altitudinis in subjectis vitae: sunt haec tria sicut finis primus, finis medius qui vocatur causa, et finis ultimus qui vocatur effectus: quod finis, causa et effectus constituant tres gradus altitudinis, supra ostensum est et multis confirmatum. <p>
