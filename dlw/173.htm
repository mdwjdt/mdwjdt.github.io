<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第三部分</h4><h4 align="center">3.1 灵界有大气、水、陆地，和自然界一样；只不过前者是属灵的，而后者是属世的</h4><p>173、我们在前面讨论并在《天堂与地狱》一书说明，灵界和自然界很相似；唯一不同的是，灵界的每一个事物都是属灵的，而自然界的每一个事物都是属世的。这两个世界差不多，都有大气、水和陆地，即普遍成分；一切事物都以无限多样性通过并从这些普遍成分取得自己的形式。</p>

173. Angelic Wisdom about Divine Love<p>Part 3<p>There are atmospheres, liquids, and solids in the spiritual world just as there are in the physical world, but they are spiritual, while ours are physical. I have already noted (and in the book Heaven and Hell illustrated) the fact that the spiritual world and the physical world are similar to each other, the only difference being that every single thing in the spiritual world is spiritual and every single thing in the physical world is physical. Because these two worlds are similar to each other, there are atmospheres, liquids, and solids in each. These are the general elements that provide the means and substances for all the infinite variety of phenomena that arise. </p>

173. PART THREE<p>The spiritual world has in it atmospheres, bodies of water and lands, like the natural world; only the first are spiritual, while the latter are natural. The fact that the spiritual world and the natural world are alike, the only difference being that each and every thing in the spiritual world is spiritual, while each and every thing in the natural world is natural - this we have declared in preceding discussions and shown in the book Heaven and Hell.<p>Since these two worlds are alike, therefore they each have in them atmospheres, bodies of water and lands, which are the general constituents through which and from which each and all things arise with infinite variety. </p>

173. PART III <p>IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD THERE ARE ATMOSPHERES, WATERS AND EARTHS, JUST AS IN THE NATURAL WORLD; BUT THE FORMER ARE SPIRITUAL, WHILE THE LATTER ARE NATURAL <p>It has been shown in preceding pages and in the work HEAVEN AND HELL, that the spiritual world and the natural world are alike, with the difference only that each and all things of the spiritual world are spiritual, whereas each and all things of the natural world are natural. Since those two Worlds are alike, therefore in both there are atmospheres, waters and earths, which are the general things through and from which each and all things exist with infinite variety. </p>

173. PART THIRD. <p>IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD THERE ARE ATMOSPHERES, WATERS AND LANDS, JUST AS IN THE NATURAL WORLD; ONLY THE FORMER ARE SPIRITUAL, WHILE THE LATTER ARE NATURAL. <p>It has been said in the preceding pages, and shown in the work Heaven and Hell, that the spiritual world is like the natural world, with the difference only that each and every thing of the spiritual world is spiritual, and each and every thing of the natural world is natural. As these two worlds are alike, there are in both, atmospheres, waters, and lands, which are the generals through and from which each and all things take their form [existunt] with infinite variety. </p>

<p>
173. SAPIENTIA ANGELICA <p>DE <p>DIVINO AMORE <p>[ET DE <p>DIVINA SAPIENTIA] <p>------------ <p>PARS TERTIA <p>QUOD IN MUNDO SPIRITUALI SINT ATHMOSPHAERAE, AQUAE ET TERRAE, QUEMADMODUM IN MUNDO NATURALI; SED QUOD ILLAE SINT SPIRITUALES, HAE AUTEM NATURALES. Quod Mundus spiritualis et Mundus naturalis similes sint, cum sola differentia, quod omnia et singula Mundi spiritualis sint spiritualia, ac omnia et singula Mundi naturalis sint naturalia, in antecedentibus dictum est, et in Opere de COELO ET INFERNO ostensum. Quoniam duo illi Mundi similes sunt, ideo in utrisque sunt Athmosphaerae, Aquae et Terrae, quae sunt communia, per quae et ex quibus omnia et singula cum infinita varietate existunt. </p>
