<h4 align="center"></h4><p>211、由于文明、道德和属灵的一切事物都通过层级来发展，和自然事物一样，不仅通过连续层级，还通过离散层级发展；还由于离散层级的发展就像目的到原因、原因到结果的发展，所以我选择通过刚才所提到的例子，即通过引用爱和智慧、意愿和理解力、情感和思维、仁和信的例子来说明和证实目前的观点：最终层级是在先层级的复合物、容器和基础。</p>

<p>
211. Since all societal, moral, and spiritual events, like all physical ones, happen not only by gradual levels but also on distinct levels, and since processes on distinct levels are like the processes of purpose to means and means to result, I should like to illustrate and demonstrate the present topic (that the final level is the composite, vessel, and foundation of the prior levels) by what I have just mentioned, namely instances of love and wisdom, of volition and discernment, of feeling and thought, and of charity and faith. </p>

<p>
211. Since all civil, moral and spiritual matters progress by degrees in the same way as natural phenomena, not only by continuous degrees but also by discrete degrees, and since the progressions of discrete degrees are like the progressions of ends to causes and of causes to effects, therefore in order to illustrate and confirm the present proposition, which is that the last degree embraces, contains, and is the foundation of the prior degrees, I have chosen to do so by showing it in relation to the aforementioned instances, namely, by citing the examples of love and wisdom, of will and intellect, of affection and thought, and of charity and faith. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #211 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
211. Since all things civil, moral and spiritual, progress through degrees just as natural things do, not only through continuous, but also through discrete degrees, and since the progressions of discrete degrees are like progressions of ends to causes, and of causes to effects, I have purposed to illustrate and confirm the present subject-matter which is that the ultimate degree is the complex, containant and base of prior degrees, by the things above mentioned, namely, by those things pertaining to love and wisdom, to will and understanding, to affection and thought, and to charity and faith. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #211 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
211. Since all things civil, moral, and spiritual advance through degrees, just as natural things do, not only through continuous but also through discrete degrees; and since the progressions of discrete degrees are like progressions of ends to causes, and of causes to effects, I have chosen to illustrate and confirm the present point, that the outmost degree is the complex, containant, and base of prior degrees, by the things above mentioned, that is, by what pertains to love and wisdom, to will and understanding, to affection and thought, and to charity and faith. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #211 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
211. Quoniam omnes res civiles, morales et spirituales similiter <sup>1</sup>
per gradus progrediuntur, sicut res naturales, non solum per gradus continuos, sed etiam per gradus discretos, et progressiones graduum discretorum se habent sicut progressiones finium ad causas, et causarum ad effectus, volui rem praesentem, quae est, quod Gradus ultimus sit complexus, continens et basis graduum priorum, illustrare et confirmare per supradicta, nempe per <sup>2</sup>
illa quae sunt amoris et sapientiae, voluntatis et intellectus, affectionis et cogitationis, ac charitatis et fidei. <p>
