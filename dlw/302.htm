<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">4.5 灵界和自然界各有三层大气，这些大气以其最终形式终止于诸如出现在地上的那类物质和材料中</h4><p>302、第三部分(173-176节)已说明，灵界和自然界都有三层大气，这些大气照着高度层级而彼此有别，并且在下降到低层的过程中照着广度层级而活性减弱。由于大气在下降到低层的过程中活性减弱，所以可推知，它们不断变得越来越紧缩和惰性，直到最后它们变得如此紧缩和惰性，以致它们不再是大气，而是静止的物质，并在自然界固定下来，就像地上被称为物质和材料的东西那样。从物质和材料的这种起源可推知，第一，这些物质和材料也具有三个层级；第二，它们通过周围的大气被相互联系在一起；第三，它们被适当地构成，以产生具有形式的一切功用。</p>

302. The atmospheres--three in number in each world, spiritual and physical--in their final forms terminate in the kinds of material substance characteristic of our earth. In <a href="173.htm" target=_top>173-176</a> [<a href="173.htm" target=_top>173-178</a>] of part 3, I explained that there are three atmospheres in each world, the spiritual and the physical, distinguished from each other by vertical levels and diminishing as they move downward by horizontal levels. Since the atmospheres do diminish as they move lower, it follows that they are constantly becoming denser and less active, ultimately so dense and inactive that they are no longer atmospheres but inert substances, and in a physical world they become stable, like the substances on earth that we call "matter."<p>There are three consequences of this origin of material substances. First, material substances also have three levels. Second, they are kept in interconnection by the enveloping atmospheres. Third, they are suited in their forms to the production of all kinds of useful activity. </p>

302. There are in each world, in the spiritual world and in the natural world, three atmospheres, and these terminate in their final forms in such substances and materials as occur in the earth. We showed in Part Three, nos. <a href="173.htm">173-176</a>, that there are in each world, in the spiritual world and in the natural world, three atmospheres, which are distinguished from each other in accordance with degrees of height, and which in their descent to lower levels decrease in accordance with degrees of breadth. Now because the atmospheres in their descent to lower levels decrease, it follows that they continually become more compressed and inert, until at last they become so compressed and inert that they are no longer atmospheres, but substances at rest, and in the natural world fixed, such as exist in the earth and are called material substances.<p>From this origin of substances and materials, it follows, first, that these substances and materials are also of three degrees. Secondly, that they are held in their connection with each other by the surrounding atmospheres. And thirdly, that they have been suitably constituted to produce all useful ends in their forms. </p>

302. THE ATMOSPHERES, OF WHICH THERE ARE THREE, BOTH IN THE SPIRITUAL AND THE NATURAL WORLD, IN THEIR ULTIMATES TERMINATE IN SUCH SUBSTANCES AND MATTERS AS ARE ON THE EARTH <p>It has been shown in Part III (<a href="173.htm">173-176</a>) that there are three atmospheres both in the spiritual and the natural world, which are distinguished from each other according to degrees of height, and which in their progress towards lower things decrease according to degrees of breadth. And because atmospheres decrease in their progress towards lower things, it follows that they continually become more dense and inert, and finally in ultimates, become so dense and inert as to be no longer atmospheres, but substances at rest, and in the natural world fixed like those on the earth called matters. From this origin of substances and matters it follows, first, that these substances and matters are also of three degrees; secondly, that they are held together in mutual connection by the surrounding atmospheres; thirdly, that they are accommodated to the production of all uses in their forms. </p>

302. THE ATMOSPHERES, OF WHICH THERE ARE THREE BOTH IN THE SPIRITUAL AND IN THE NATURAL WORLD, IN THEIR OUTMOSTS CLOSE INTO SUBSTANCES AND MATTERS SUCH AS ARE IN LANDS. <p>It has been shown in Part Third (n. <a href="173.htm" target=_top>173-176</a>), that there are three atmospheres both in the spiritual and in the natural world, which are distinct from each other according to degrees of height, and which, in their progress toward lower things, decrease [in activity] according to degrees of breadth. And since atmospheres in their progress toward lower things decrease [in activity], it follows that they constantly become more compressed and inert, and finally, in outmosts, become so compressed and inert as to be no longer atmospheres, but substances at rest, and in the natural world, fixed like those in the lands that are called matters. As such is the origin of substances and matters, it follows, first, that these substances and matters also are of three degrees; secondly, that they are held together in mutual connection by encompassing atmospheres; thirdly, that they are fitted for the production of all uses in their forms. </p>

302. QUOD ATHMOSPHAERAE, QUAE TRES SUNT IN UTROQUE MUNDO, SPIRITUALI ET NATURALI, IN ULTIMIS SUIS DESINANT IN SUBSTANTIAS ET MATERIAS, QUALES SUNT IN TERRIS. Quod tres Athmosphaerae in utroque Mundo, Spirituali et Naturali[,] sint, quae inter se secundum gradus altitudinis distinctae sunt, et quae versus inferiora secundum gradus latitudinis in progrediendo decrescunt, in Parte Tertia <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_302/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_173" target=_top>173-176</a>, ostensum est: et quia Athmosphaerae versus inferiora progrediendo decrescunt, sequitur quod continue compressiores ac inertiores fiant, et tandem in ultimis ita compressae et inertes, ut non sint Athmosphaerae amplius, sed substantiae quietis, et in Mundo naturali fixae, quales sunt in terris, et materiae vocantur. Ex qua substantiarum et materiarum origine, sequitur Primum, quod substantiae et materiae illae etiam sint trium graduum. Alterum, quod contineantur in nexu inter se ab athmosphaeris ambientibus. Tertium, quod accommodatae sint ad producendum omnes usus in suis formis. </p>
