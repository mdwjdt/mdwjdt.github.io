<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第306节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>306、大地从灵界太阳经由作为媒介的大气的这种起源，根本无法以源于属世观念的词语来描述，只能以源于属灵观念的词语来描述，因为属灵观念脱离了空间。然而，它们因脱离了空间，故无法用任何属世语言的词语来表达。从前面(295节)可以看出，属灵的思维、言语和著作如此不同于属世的思维、言语和著作，以至于它们毫无共同之处，只通过对应交流。因此，以某种属世的方式来理解大地的起源就足够了。</p>

306. There is no other way to describe the origin of earth from the spiritual sun by means of the atmospheres using words that issue from earthly concepts. It can be described differently using words derived from spiritual concepts, though, because these are nonspatial; and since they are nonspatial, they do not fit into any words of an earthly language.<p>See above (295) on the fact that spiritual thought, speech, and writing are so different from earthly thought, speech, and writing that they have nothing in common, and communicate only by means of correspondences. It will have to do, then, that we understand the origin of earth to some extent physically. </p>

306. The origin of the earth from the spiritual sun by means of the atmospheres cannot be otherwise described in words springing from natural ideas, but they can be otherwise described in words springing from spiritual ideas, because the latter are independent of space. However, because they are independent of space, they are beyond expression in the words of any natural language.<p>It may be seen in no. <a href="295.htm">295</a> above that spiritual thoughts, speech and writing differ so much from natural thoughts, speech and writing that they have nothing in common, and that they communicate only through correspondences. It is sufficient, therefore, for the origin of the earth to be perceived in some way naturally. </p>

306. The origin of the earth from the spiritual Sun by means of the atmospheres, cannot be described otherwise by words flowing forth from natural ideas, but can be, by words flowing forth from spiritual ideas. Because such are apart from space, they do not fall into any words of natural language. Spiritual thoughts, speech and writings differ so completely from natural thoughts, speech and writings that they have nothing in common, and that they communicate only by correspondences may be seen above (<a href="295.htm">295</a>). It is sufficient, therefore, that the origin of the earth be perceived naturally in any measure at all. </p>

<p>
306. The origin of lands from the spiritual sun through the atmospheres, as mediums, can no otherwise be described by expressions flowing out of natural ideas, but may by expressions flowing out of spiritual ideas, because these are apart from space, and for this reason, they do not fall into any expressions of natural language. That spiritual thoughts, speech, and writings differ so entirely from natural thoughts, speech, and writings, that they have nothing in common, and have communication only by correspondences, may be seen above (n. <a href="295.htm" target=_top>295</a>). It may suffice, therefore, if the origin of lands be perceived in some measure naturally. </p>

306. Origo terrarum a Sole Spirituali mediis Athmosphaeris per voces ex naturalibus ideis fluentes non aliter describi potest, sed potest aliter per voces ex spiritualibus ideis, quia hae absque spatio sunt; et quia sunt absque spatio, non cadunt in aliquas voces linguae naturalis. Quod cogitationes, loquelae et scripturae spirituales a cogitationibus, loquelis et scripturis naturalibus in tantum differant, ut non aliquid commune habeant, et quod communicent <sup>1</sup>
solum per correspondentias, videatur supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_306/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_295" target=_top>295</a>: satis itaque est, ut origo terrarum aliquo modo naturaliter percipiatur. <p>
