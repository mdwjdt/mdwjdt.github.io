<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">5.3 意愿与心存在一种对应关系，理解力与肺存在一种对应关系</h4><p>371、现按以下顺序说明这一点：<br><br>⑴心智的一切都与意愿和理解力有关，身体的一切都与心和肺有关。<br><br>⑵意愿和理解力与心和肺存在一种对应关系，因此心智的一切与身体的一切存在一种对应关系。<br><br>⑶意愿对应于心。<br><br>⑷理解力对应于肺。<br><br>⑸凭借这种对应关系可以发现与意愿和理解力，因而也与爱和智慧有关的许多奥秘。<br><br>⑹人的心智就是他的灵，灵就是这个人，而身体是心智或灵在世界进行感觉和活动所借助的一个外在工具。<br><br>⑺人的灵和身体的结合是由于他的意愿和理解力与心和肺的对应关系，而它们的分离则是由于这种对应关系的缺乏。</p>

371. There is a correspondence between volition and the heart and between discernment and the lungs. This will be presented in the following series.<p>1. Everything in the mind goes back to volition and discernment, and everything in the body goes back to the heart and the lungs.<p>2. There is a correspondence of volition and discernment with the heart and the lungs and a consequent correspondence of everything in our minds with everything in our bodies.<p>3. Volition corresponds to the heart.<p>4. Discernment corresponds to the lungs.<p>5. This relationship enables us to discover many secrets about our volition and discernment and also about love and wisdom.<p>6. Our mind is our spirit, and the spirit is a person, with the body being a covering through which the mind or spirit senses and acts in its world.<p>7. The union of the human spirit and body is accomplished through the correspondence of volition and discernment with the heart and lungs, and disunion is caused by a lack of correspondence. </p>

371. There is a correspondence of the will with the heart, and of the intellect with the lungs. We propose to demonstrate this according to the following outline:<p>(1) All the constituents of the mind are connected with the will and intellect, and all the constituents of the body with the heart and lungs.<p>(2) There is a correspondence of the will and intellect with the heart and lungs, and consequently a correspondence of all the mind's constituents with all the body's constituents.<p>(3) The will corresponds to the heart.<p>(4) The intellect corresponds to the lungs.<p>(5) Through that correspondence one can discover many secrets relating to the will and intellect, and so also to love and wisdom.<p>(6) A person's mind is his spirit, and the spirit is the person, the body being the outward instrument by which the mind or spirit senses and acts in the physical world.<p>(7) The conjunction of a person's spirit with the body is due to the correspondence of his will and intellect with his heart and lungs, and their disjunction to the absence of that correspondence. </p>

<p>
371. THERE IS A CORRESPONDENCE OF THE WILL WITH THE HEART, AND OF THE UNDERSTANDING WITH THE LUNGS <p>This is to be shown in the following order: <p>(i) All things of the mind have relation to the will and understanding, and all things of the body to the heart and lungs. <p>(ii) There is a correspondence of the will and understanding with the heart and lungs, and from this a correspondence of all things of the mind with all things of the body. <p>(iii) The will corresponds to the heart. <p>(iv) The understanding corresponds to the lungs. <p>(v) By means of this correspondence many arcana relating to the will and understanding, and therefore also concerning love and wisdom, may be disclosed. <p>(vi) Man's mind is his spirit, and the spirit is the man. The body is the external through which the mind or spirit feels and acts in its world. <p>(vii) The union of man's spirit with the body is by the correspondence of his will and understanding with his heart and lungs, and separation is through non-correspondence. </p>

371.

371. QUOD CORRESPONDENTIA VOLUNTATIS CUM CORDE, ET INTELLECTUS CUM PULMONE SIT. Hoc in hac serie demonstrandum est. I. Quod omnia Mentis se referant ad Voluntatem et Intellectum, et omnia corporis ad Cor et Pulmonem. II. Quod correspondentia voluntatis et intellectus sit cum corde et pulmone, et inde correspondentia omnium mentis cum omnibus corporis. III. Quod voluntas <sup>1</sup>
correspondeat cordi. IV. Quod intellectus correspondeat pulmoni. V. Quod per correspondentiam illam detegi possint multa arcana de voluntate et intellectu, ita quoque de amore et sapientia. VI. Quod Mens hominis sit ejus spiritus, et quod spiritus sit homo, et quod corpus sit externum per quod mens seu spiritus sentit et agit in suo Mundo. VII. Quod conjunctio spiritus hominis cum corpore sit per correspondentiam voluntatis et intellectus ejus cum corde et pulmone ejus, et disjunctio per non correspondentiam. <p>
