<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第156节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>156、不能说宇宙及其万物的创造是从空间到空间，或从时间到时间，因而是循序渐进进行的，而是从永恒和无限进行的；不是从时间的永恒，因为这种事物并不存在，而是从没有时间的永恒，因为这与神性是一样的；也不是从空间的无限，因为这种事物同样不存在，而是从没有空间的无限，这与神性也是一样的。我知道，这些概念超出了属世之光中的思想观念，但并未超出属灵之光中的思想观念，因为后者没有空间或时间的概念在里面。事实上，它们也并未完全超出属世之光中的观念；因为当说到空间的无限是不可能的时，谁都能凭理性赞同这一点。永恒也一样，因为这是时间的无限。如果你说“直到永恒”，从时间的角度可以理解；不过，如果说“自永恒”就无法理解了，除非剔除时间观念。</p>

156. We cannot say that the creation of the universe and everything in it happened from one place to another or from one moment in time to another, that is, gradually and sequentially. We must say that it happened from eternity and from infinity, and not from an eternity of time, since there is no such thing, but from a nontemporal eternity that is the same as Divinity, and not from an infinity of space, since there is no such thing, but from a nonspatial infinity that is also the same as Divinity.<p>I know that all this transcends any mental images that arise in physical light, but they do not transcend mental images that arise in spiritual light. There is no trace of space and time in these latter images. Actually, this does not completely transcend images that arise in physical light, since everyone would agree on the basis of reason that there is no such thing as an infinity of space. The same holds for eternity, which is an infinity of time. If you say "to eternity," this can be understood in temporal terms; but if you say "from eternity," that is incomprehensible unless you banish time. </p>

156. The creation of the universe and everything in it cannot be said to have proceeded from point to point in space, or from moment to moment in time, thus progressively and successively. Rather it must be said to have proceeded from eternity and infinity - not from an eternity of time, because that does not exist, but from an eternity devoid of time, for that is identical with the Divine; and not from an infinity of space, because that does not exist, but from an infinity devoid of space, which is likewise identical with the Divine.<p>I know that these concepts transcend the ideas of thoughts which are caught up in natural light, but they do not transcend the ideas of thoughts which are formed in a state of spiritual light, for the latter have in them no notion of space or time. In fact, neither do these concepts completely transcend the ideas of thoughts formed in natural light, for when told that an infinity of space is not possible, everyone in accord with reason assents to it. It is the same with eternity, for this is an infinity of time. If we say, "to eternity," this is comprehended from the standpoint of time, but it is not comprehended if we say, "from eternity," unless the notion of time is set aside. </p>

<p>
156. The creation of the universe and everything therein cannot be said to have been brought about from space to space, nor from time to time, thus progressively and successively, but from Eternity and from Infinity; not from eternity of time because there is no such thing, but from eternity, not of time, for this is the same with the Divine; neither [was it] from eternity of space because again there is no such thing, but from eternity not of space, which also is the same with the Divine. I know these things transcend the ideas of thoughts which are in natural light but they do not transcend the ideas of thoughts which are in spiritual light, for in these there is nothing of space and time. Neither do they quite transcend ideas in natural light, for when it is said that there is no infinity of space, this everyone grants from reason. It is the same with eternity for this is infinity of time. If it is said to eternity this is comprehended from time; but from eternity is not comprehended unless time is removed. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #156 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
156. The creation of the universe, and of all things of it, cannot be said to have been wrought from space to space, or from time to time, thus progressively and successively, but from eternity and from infinity; not from eternity of time, because there is no such thing, but from eternity not of time, for this is the same with the Divine; nor from infinity of space, because again there is no such thing, but from infinity not of space, which also is the same with the Divine. These things, I know, transcend the ideas of thoughts that are in natural light, but they do not transcend the ideas of thoughts that are in spiritual light, for in these there is nothing of space and time. Neither do they wholly transcend ideas that are in natural light; for when it is said that infinity of space is not possible, this is affirmed by every one from reason. It is the same with eternity, for this is infinity of time. If you say "to eternity," it is comprehensible from time; but "from eternity" is not comprehensible, unless time is removed. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #156 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
156. Creatio Universi et omnium ejus non dici potest facta a spatio ad spatium, nec a tempore ad tempus, ita progressive et successive, sed ab Aeterno et ab Infinito, non ab Aeterno temporis, quia hoc non datur, sed ab Aeterno non temporis, hoc enim est idem cum Divino; nec ab Infinito spatii, quia hoc nec datur, sed ab Infinito non spatii, quod etiam est idem cum Divino. Scio quod haec transcendant ideas cogitationum quae sunt in naturali luce, sed non transcendunt ideas cogitationum quae sunt in spirituali luce, in his enim nihil spatii et temporis est: imo nec plane transcendunt in luce naturali, nam cum dicitur, quod infinitum spatii non detur, hoc quisque ex ratione affirmat; simile est cum aeterno, hoc enim est infinitum temporis; si dicitur in aeternum, hoc comprehenditur a tempore, non autem ab aeterno, nisi removeatur tempus. </p>
