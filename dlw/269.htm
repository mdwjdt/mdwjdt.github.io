269, 4. Things that have become part of our love and life are passed on to our offspring. It is generally acknowledged that we are born into evil and that we get this as an inheritance from our parents. Some people believe that it is not from our parents, but through them from Adam; but this is a mistake. It comes from the father, from whom we get the soul that is clothed with a body in the mother. The semen that comes from the father is the first vessel of life; but it is the kind of vessel it was in the father. It is actually in the form of his love, and everyone's love is the same in its largest and its smallest forms. There is within it a striving toward the human form, a form into which it gradually develops. It follows, then, that the evils we call hereditary come from our fathers and are therefore handed down from our grandfathers and earlier ancestors to their offspring in sequence.<p>Experience tells us this, too. There is a likeness of disposition in peoples that comes from their first ancestor, a greater likeness within extended families, and a still greater likeness within individual households. The similarity is so clear that we recognize lineages not only by their dispositions but by their faces as well. There will be more about the way evil love is born into us from our parents later on, when I discuss the way the mind (that is, our volition and discernment) corresponds to the body and its members and organs. At this point I cite only a few things in order to show that evils are handed down from our parents in sequence and that they grow, piling up one generation after another, until we are nothing but evil at birth. The viciousness of evil increases in proportion to the closing of the spiritual mind, with the earthly mind closing to anything from above as well. This is remedied in our descendants only by their abstaining from evils as sins, with the Lord's help. There is no other way to open the spiritual mind and thereby bring the earthly mind back into a corresponding form. </p>

<p>269. (4) Qualities that have become matters of one's love and consequent life are passed on hereditarily to offspring. People know that a person is born into a state of evil, and that he acquires this state hereditarily from his parents. Some also believe that he acquires it not from his parents, but through his parents from Adam, but this is an erroneous supposition. A person acquires the state from his father, from whom he has his soul, which is clothed with a body in the mother. For the sperm which comes from the father is the first vessel receptive of life - a vessel, however, of such a character as it was in the father, being in the form of his love, and everyone's love in the greatest and least of its forms is the same. The sperm moreover carries within it an endeavor toward the human form, into which it also gradually develops. It follows therefore that evils we call hereditary come from fathers, and so from grandfathers and great-grandfathers, being transmitted in succession from them into their offspring.<p>Experience, too, attests to this. For nations exhibit a likeness in their affections to their earliest progenitor, and even more so clans, and still more individual families. Indeed they exhibit such a likeness that succeeding generations are discerned not only from their dispositions but also from their facial features.<p> </p>
<p>[2] On this subject, however, regarding the hereditary transmission of a love of evil from parents into offspring, we will say more in subsequent discussions where we take up the correspondence of the mind or of the will and intellect with the body and its members and organs. We have presented only these few observations here in order to make it known that evils are passed on in succession from parents; that in consequence of the accumulated evils of one generation after another they increase, to the point that a person from birth is nothing but a mass of evil; that the malignity of the evil grows to the degree that the spiritual mind is closed, for the natural mind is then closed above; and that this condition is not restored to its original state in succeeding generations except by their refraining from evils as sins in obedience to the Lord. Thus and no otherwise is the spiritual mind opened and the natural mind thereby brought back into a corresponding form. </p>

<p>269. (iv) Such things as have come to be of the love and consequently of the life are engendered in offspring. It is well known that man is born into evil, and that he derives it from parents by heredity. And by some it is believed that he inherits it not from parents, but through parents from Adam; but this is an error. He derives it from the father from whom he has a soul, and it is clothed with a body in the mother. For the seed, which is from the father, is the first receptacle of life, but such a receptacle as it was with the father. For it is in the form of his love, and the love of each man in things greatest and least, is similar to itself and there is in the seed a conatus into the human form, into which indeed it successively goes forth. Hence it follows that the evils called hereditary are from fathers, thus from grandfathers and ancestors successively transmitted to offspring. Experience teaches this same thing for as regards the affections, there is a resemblance of races to their first progenitors, and a stronger resemblance in families, and a still stronger resemblance in households. Indeed such is the resemblance that generations are distinguishable, not only from dispositions, but even from faces. But concerning this ingeneration of the love of evil from parents to offspring more will be said in what follows where the correspondence of the mind, that is of the will and understanding, with the body and its members and organs, is treated of. Here these few things only are brought forward that it may be known that evils are derived from parents successively, and that they increase through the accumulations of one after another, until man by birth is nothing but evil; also that the malignity of the evil increases according to the degree in which the spiritual mind is closed up, for in this way, the natural mind is also closed above. Finally there is no recovery from this in posterity except by shunning evils as sins by help from the Lord. In this and in no other way is the spiritual mind opened, and through it the natural mind is brought back into a correspondent form. </p>

But of this ingeneration of the love of evil by parents in offspring more will be said in what follows, where the correspondence of the mind, that is, of the will and understanding, with the body and its members and organs will be fully treated of.

<p>269. IV. Quod illa, quae facta sunt amoris et inde vitae, ingenerentur proli. Notum est, quod homo nascatur in malum, et quod id trahat ut haereditarium a parentibus; et a quibusdam creditur, quod non a parentibus, sed per parentes ex Adamo, sed hoc est error; trahit id a Patre, a quo est ei anima, ac induitur corpore apud Matrem: semen enim, quod est ex Patre, est primum receptaculum vitae, sed tale receptaculum, quale fuit apud patrem, est enim in forma amoris ejus, et amor cujusvis in maximis et minimis sibi similis est[;] et est in illo conatus in formam <sup>1</sup>
humanam, in quam etiam abit successive; inde sequitur, quod mala, quae vocantur haereditaria, sint a patribus, ita ab avis et atavis successive derivata in progenies. Hoc etiam experientia docet, est enim quoad affectiones similitudo gentium cum primo genitore suo, et magis similitudo familiarum, et adhuc magis similitudo domuum; imo talis similitudo, ut internoscantur generationes non modo ab animis, sed etiam a faciebus. <sup>2</sup>
<p> </p>
<p>[2] Sed de ingeneratione amoris mali a parentibus in proles, in sequentibus, ubi de correspondentia mentis, seu voluntatis et intellectus, cum corpore et ejus membris et organis, plura dicentur: hic solum haec pauca allata sunt, ut sciatur, <sup>3</sup>
quod mala a parentibus successive deriventur, et quod per accumulationes unius post alterum increscant, usque ut homo ex nativitate non sit nisi quam malum; et quod malignitas mali crescat secundum gradum occlusionis Mentis spiritualis, sic enim Mens naturalis etiam superius clauditur; et quod hoc in posteris non restituatur, nisi per fugere mala ut peccata ex Domino; sic non aliter aperitur Mens spiritualis, et per illud Mens naturalis in formam correspondentem reducitur. <p>
