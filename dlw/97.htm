<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第97节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>97、人人都要当心，不要以为灵界太阳是神本身。神本身是一位人。祂的爱与智慧的最先发出是火热的属灵物质，这物质在天使面前显为一轮太阳。因此，当主亲自向天使显现祂自己时，祂以一位人来显现祂自己；这人有时在太阳之内，有时在太阳之外。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #97 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
97. Take care not to think that the spiritual world's sun is actually God. The real God is a person. The first emanation from his love and wisdom is something fiery and spiritual that looks like a sun to angels. When the Lord makes himself visible to angels in person, then, he does so in human form, sometimes within the sun, sometimes outside it. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #97 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
97. Let everyone take care not to think that the sun in the spiritual world is God Himself. God Himself is human. The first emanation from His love and wisdom is a spiritually fiery one, which appears to angels as the sun. Consequently when the Lord manifests Himself to angels in person, He manifests Himself as a person, and this sometimes in the sun, sometimes outside of it. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #97 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
97. Let everyone beware of thinking that the Sun of the spiritual world is God Himself. God Himself is a Man. The first proceeding from His Love and Wisdom is a fiery spiritual thing which appears before the angels as a Sun. Wherefore when the Lord manifests Himself to the angels in person, He manifests Himself as a Man, and this sometimes in the Sun, sometimes outside it. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #97 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
97. Let every one beware of thinking that the sun of the spiritual world is God Himself. God Himself is a Man. The first proceeding from His Love and Wisdom is that fiery spiritual [substance] which appears before the angels as a sun. When, therefore, the Lord manifests Himself to the angels in person, He manifests Himself as a Man; and this sometimes in the sun, sometimes outside of it. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #97 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
97. Caveat sibi quisque, ne cogitet, quod Sol mundi Spiritualis sit ipse Deus; Ipse Deus est Homo; primum procedens ex Ipsius Amore et Sapientia est Igneum Spirituale, quod apparet coram angelis ut Sol: quare cum Dominus se manifestat angelis in Persona, manifestat se ut Homo, et hoc quandoque in Sole, quandoque extra Solem. </p>
