<h4 align="center"></h4><p>324、《属天的奥秘》(《天堂的奥秘》)和《天堂与地狱》这两本书的多个地方，以及本书论述对应关系的章节的各处，都已证实，事实的确如此。此外，我们还在这些地方说明：受造宇宙中没有一物不对应于人里面的某种事物，不仅对应于其情感和由此而来的思维，还对应于其身体器官和内脏；然而，不是对应于它们的物质部分，而是对应于它们的功用。正因如此，当圣言论述教会和教会之人时，常常提到树木，如橄榄树、葡萄树、香柏树，还有花园、果园和森林，以及地上的野兽，空中的飞鸟，海里的鱼。那里提到它们，是因为它们相对应，并通过对应关系构成一体，如前所述。因此，当世人在圣言中读到这些事物时，天使感知到的不是这些事物，而是教会或教会之人的各种状态。</p>

324. There is ample support for the truth of this in Secrets of Heaven and also in the book on Heaven and Hell, as well as throughout the preceding pages where I have dealt with correspondence [<a href="52.htm" target=_top>52</a>, <a href="83.htm" target=_top>83</a>, <a href="87.htm" target=_top>87</a>]. I explained there that there is nothing in the created universe that does not answer to something in us, not only to our feelings and consequent thoughts, but also to our physical organs and viscera--not in respect to their substances, but in respect to their functions.<p>This is why when the Word talks about the church and its people, there is such frequent mention of trees like the olive and the vine and the cedar, of gardens and groves and woods, and of the beasts of the field, the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea. They are mentioned because they correspond and are united by corresponding, as noted. So too, when we are reading things like this in the Word, angels are not conscious of them but of the church in their stead, or of the church's people in regard to their state. </p>

324. The reality of this is something we have attested in many places in Arcana Coelestia (The Secrets of Heaven), and also in the book Heaven and Hell, and now here and there in the preceding pages where we have taken up correspondence. Moreover, we have shown in those places that there is nothing in the created universe that does not have a correspondence to some element in the human being, not only to his affections and consequent thoughts, but also to the organs and viscera of his body - not to them as substances, but to them as forms of useful endeavor.<p>So it is that when the Word refers to the church and the person of the church, it so often speaks of trees, such as olives, vines, and cedars, and of gardens, groves, and forests, and so, too, of beasts of the earth, birds of the air, and fish of the sea. It speaks of these because they correspond, and, as we said, by correspondence accord. Consequently angels also do not perceive the things named, but instead of these the church or people of the church in their various states. </p>

324. That this is so has been abundantly confirmed in ARCANA CAELESTIA, and in the work HEAVEN AND HELL, and also in preceding sections where correspondence has been treated of. It has there been shown also that there can be nothing in the created universe which has not a correspondence with something in man, not only with his affections and consequent thoughts, but also with his bodily organs and viscera, yet not with these as substances but as uses. Hence it is that in the Word, where the Church and the man of the Church are treated of, there are so often mentioned trees, such as olives, vines and cedars, also gardens, groves and woods, and the beasts of the earth, birds of the air and fish of the sea. They are mentioned because they correspond, and by correspondence make one, as was stated above. Consequently, when such things are read of in the Word by man, they are not perceived by angels, but instead, the Church or the men of the Church as to their states. </p>

<p>
324. That this is so has been abundantly confirmed in the Arcana Coelestia, also in the work Heaven and Hell, and occasionally in the preceding pages where correspondence is treated of. It has been there shown also that nothing is to be found in the created universe which has not a correspondence with something in man, not only with his affections and their thoughts, but also with his bodily organs and viscera; not with these however as substances, but as uses. From this it is that in the Word, where the church and the man of the church are treated of, such frequent mention is made of trees, such as "olives," "vines," and "cedars;" of "gardens," "groves" and "woods;" and of the "beasts of the earth," "birds of the air," and "fish of the sea." They are there mentioned because they correspond, and by correspondence make one, as was said above; consequently, when such things are read in the Word by man, these objects are not perceived by angels, but the church or the men of the church in respect to their states are perceived instead. </p>

<p>
324. Quod ita sit, multis confirmatum est in ARCANIS COELESTIBUS; et quoque in Opere de COELO ET INFERNO, et quoque passim in antecedentibus, ubi de Correspondentia actum est: ibi etiam ostensum est, quod nihil detur in Universo <sup>1</sup>
Creato, quod <sup>2</sup>
non correspondentiam habeat cum aliquo hominis, non modo cum ejus affectionibus et inde cogitationibus, sed etiam cum ejus corporis organis et visceribus, non cum illis ut substantiis, sed cum illis ut usibus. Inde est, quod in Verbo, ubi agitur de Ecclesia et de homine ejus, toties nominentur arbores, ut oleae, vites et cedri, tum horti, luci et sylvae, ut et animalia terrae, volatilia coeli, ac pisces maris: nominantur ibi quia correspondent, et per correspondentiam unum faciunt, sicut dictum est; quare etiam Angeli, cum talia ab homine leguntur in Verbo, non percipiunt illa, sed pro illis Ecclesiam, seu homines Ecclesiae quoad status eorum. <p>
