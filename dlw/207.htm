<h4 align="center"></h4><p>207、一切最终元素都包含在同步秩序中的离散层级。一切肌肉的运动纤维，一切神经纤维，以及一切脏腑和器官的纤维和小血管，都处于这种秩序。这些的最内层是最简单的事物，也是最完美的；最外层则是这些的一个组合物。一切种子，一切果实，以及一切金属和石头里面都有这些层级的类似秩序；其构成整体的各个部分都具有这样一种性质。这些部分的最内层、中间层和最外层就在这些层级中，因为它们是相继的组合物，也就是作为其最初物质或材料的简单物合在一起的捆扎和聚集。</p>

207. In every final form there are distinct levels in simultaneous arrangement. This is the arrangement of the motor fibers in every muscle, the fibers in every nerve, the fibers and tiny vessels in all our viscera and organs. At the heart of each are the simplest and most perfect substances, while the outside is formed from their compounds.<p>The same arrangement of these levels is found in every seed, every fruit, even in every metal and rock. This is the nature of the parts that constitute their totality. Their central, intermediate, and outermost parts are on these levels, and they themselves are successive compounds, aggregates, or masses of these simple components that are their primary substances and materials. </p>

207. Every final element contains discrete degrees in concurrent order. The motor fibers in every muscle, the fibers in every nerve, the fibers and vessels in every bodily part and organ - all exist in such an order. Inmostly in them are the simplest elements, which are the most perfect. The outmost component is a composite of these.<p>Degrees of this kind exist in a like order in every seed and every fruit, and also in every metal and stone. Their constituent parts are so composed, of which the whole consists. The inmost, intermediate, and outmost elements of their constituents exist in such degrees, for they are successive compositions or bundlings and conglomerations, arising from simple substances which are their first substances or materials. </p>

207. In every ultimate there are discrete degrees in simultaneous order. The motor fibres in every muscle, the fibres in every nerve, also the fibres and little vessels in all viscera and organs, are in such order. Inmostly in these are the most simple things which are the most perfect; the outmost is a composite of these. There is a like order of these degrees in every seed and in every fruit, also in every metal and stone. Their parts of which the whole is composed, are of such a nature. The inmost, the middle and the outmost things of the parts are in these degrees, for they are successive compositions, that is, bundlings and massings together from simple things which are their first substances or matters. </p>

207. In every outmost there are discrete degrees in simultaneous order. The motor fibers in every muscle, the fibers in every nerve, also the fibers and the little vessels in all viscera and organs, are in such an order. Innermost in these are the most simple things, which are the most perfect; the outermost is a composite of these. There is a like order of these degrees in every seed and in every fruit, also in every metal and stone; their parts, of which the whole is composed, are of such a nature. The innermost, the middle, and the outermost elements of the parts exist in these degrees, for they are successive compositions, that is, bundlings and massings together from simples that are their first substances or matters. </p>

207. In omni ultimo sunt gradus discreti in Ordine simultaneo: fibrae motrices in omni musculo, fibrae in omni nervo, tum fibrae et vascula in omni viscere et organo, sunt in tali ordine; intime in illis sunt simplicissima quae perfectissima[;] extimum est compositum ex illis. Similis Ordo graduum istorum est in omni semine, inque omni fructu, tum etiam in omni metallo et lapide; partes horum tales sunt, ex quibus totum; partium intima, media et extima sunt in illis gradibus, sunt enim successivae compositiones, seu confasciationes et conglobationes a simplicibus, quae sunt primae eorum substantiae seu materiae. </p>
