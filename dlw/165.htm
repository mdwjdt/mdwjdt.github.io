<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第165节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>165、创造死的太阳是为了这一目的：在创造的最终元素中的一切事物都能被固定下来，并稳固不变，因此可以由它们产生经久耐用的存在形式。只有这样，创造才得以牢固建立。水陆球体是一种基础和支撑，以便事物存在于其内、其上和周围；因为它是收官之作，一切事物在此终结，止于其上。它还是一种子宫，作为创造目的的结果从它产出，如下文所示。</p>

<p>
165. The reason for the creation of the dead sun is so that in final forms everything may be set and stable and lasting, so that it can give rise to things that last through the years. This is the only way creation can have a foundation. Our globe of lands and seas, with things like this in and on and around it, is like a solid base, since it is the final work in which everything comes to a close, on which everything rests. I will discuss later [<a href="171.htm" target=_top>171</a>] how it is also a kind of matrix from which are produced the effects that are the goals of creation. </p>

<p>
165. A lifeless sun was created in order that everything in the final elements of creation might be fixed, set and constant, and so that there might arise from them forms that would last and endure. Only in this way is creation securely established.<p>The terraqueous globe in which, on which and about which these elements and forms exist serves as a base and foundation; for it is the final work in which everything terminates and on which everything rests.<p>It also serves as a womb from which the effects which are the ends in creation are produced - something we will say more about in subsequent discussions. </p>

<p>
165. The dead sun has been created for the purpose that all things may be fixed, settled and constant in ultimates, and that from this there may come forth things which shall be lasting and enduring. In this and in no other way is creation founded. The terraqueous globe in which, upon which, and around which, such things are, is a kind of base and support. For it is the outermost work in which all [spiritual] things terminate and upon which they rest. It is also a kind of matrix, out of which effects, which are the [last] ends of creation, are produced, as will be told in what follows. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #165 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
165. A dead sun was created to this end, that in outmosts all things may be fixed, settled, and constant, and thus there may be forms of existence which shall be permanent and durable. In this and in no other way is creation founded. The terraqueous globe, in which, upon which, and about which, things exist, is a kind of base and support; for it is the outmost work [ultimum opus], in which all things terminate, and upon which they rest. It is also a kind of matrix, out of which effects, which are ends of creation, are produced, as will be shown in what follows. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #165 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
165. Quod Sol mortuus creatus sit, est ob causam ut in ultimis omnia fixa, stata et constantia sint, ac ut inde existant quae perennatura et perduratura sunt: ita non aliter fundatur Creatio: Orbis terraqueus, in quo, super quo et circum quem, talia sunt, est sicut basis et firmamentum, nam est ultimum opus, in quod omnia desinunt, et super quo quiescunt: quod etiam sit sicut Matrix, ex qua effectus, qui sunt fines creationis, producuntur, in sequentibus dicetur. </p>
