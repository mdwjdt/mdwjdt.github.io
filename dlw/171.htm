<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第171节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>171、创造通过上述三要素，即目的，原因和结果，不断朝这个最终目的发展，因为这三者同样存在于主造物主里面，如刚才所述；神性充满一切空间，却无关空间(69-72节)；神性在最大和最小事物上是一样的(77-82节)；由此明显可知，在朝最终目的发展的总体过程中，受造宇宙相对来说是中间目的。因为功用的形式不断被主造物主照它们的秩序从大地提升到人那里；就肉体而言，人也来自大地。然后，人通过从主接受爱与智慧而被提升。此外，为叫人能接受爱与智慧，所有方法都已被提供；人也如此被造以至于能接受它们，只要他愿意。综上所述，可以看出(即便只是大体上)，创造的目的在最表层的事物中取得形式；这目的就是使一切事物都回归造物主，并能有结合。 </p>

171. Creation is constantly pressing toward this final goal by means of this trio of purpose, means, and result, because these three elements are in God the Creator, as just stated. Further, Divinity is in all space nonspatially (<a href="69.htm" target=_top>69-72</a>) and is the same in the largest and smallest things (<a href="77.htm" target=_top>77-82</a>). We can see from this that the entire creation, in its general tending toward its final goal, is the intermediate end, relatively speaking. God the Creator is constantly drawing up out of the earth forms of service in their sequence, a sequence that culminates in us, who are from the earth as far as our bodies are concerned. By accepting love and wisdom from the Lord, we are then raised up and furnished with all the means for the acceptance of love and wisdom. Moreover, we are so created that we can accept them if we are only willing to.<p>What has now been said enables us to see, if only in a general way so far, that the goal of creation becomes manifest in final things, the goal being the return of all things to their Creator, and union. </p>

171. Creation advances to this ultimate end continually by means of the aforesaid three ingredients, which are end, cause and effect, because the same three exist in the Lord the Creator, as we said just above; and the Divine is present through all space independently of space (nos. <a href="69.htm">69-72</a>), and in the greatest and least of things is the same (nos. <a href="77.htm">77-82</a>). It is apparent from this that the created universe in its overall advancement to the ultimate end is, relatively to it, the intermediate end. For the Lord the Creator continually raises up from the earth forms of useful endeavor and activity in succession, culminating in the human being, who in respect to his body is from the same origin. The human being is then raised up by his reception of love and wisdom from the Lord. Moreover, in order that he may receive love and wisdom, all the means have been provided. He has also been formed such that he is capable of receiving them if only he is willing.<p>From what we have now said it can be seen - even though still only generally - that the end in creation finds expression in the lasts of it, which is for everything to return to the Creator and conjunction take place. </p>

<p>
171. Towards this ultimate end creation progresses continually through those three, which are end, cause and effect, because those three are in the Lord the Creator, as was said just above; and the Divine is in all space apart from space,<a href="69.htm">69-72</a>; and is the same in things greatest and least<a href="77.htm">77-82</a>; from which it is clear that the created universe in its general progression towards its ultimate end, is relatively the middle end. For out of the earth, forms of uses are continually raised by the Lord the Creator, in their order up to man, who as to his body, is also from the earth. Thereafter man is raised by the reception of love and wisdom from the Lord, and that he may receive love and wisdom, all the means have been provided, and he has been so made as to be able to receive, provided that he so wills. From what has now been said it can be seen, although so far in only a general way, that the end of creation exists in ultimates, and this end is that all things may return to the Creator and there may be conjunction. </p>

<p>
171. To this last end creation progresses continually, through these three, namely, end, cause, and effect, because these three are in the Lord the Creator (as was said just above); and the Divine apart from space is in all space (n. <a href="69.htm" target=_top>69-72</a>); and is the same in things greatest and least (77 <a href="77.htm" target=_top>77-82</a>); from which it is evident that the created universe, in its general progression to its last end, is relatively the middle end. For out of the earth forms of uses are continually raised by the Lord the Creator, in their order up to man, who as to his body is also from the earth. Thereafter, man is elevated by the reception of love and wisdom from the Lord; and for this reception of love and wisdom, all means are provided; and he has been so made as to be able to receive, if he will. From what has now been said it can be seen, though as yet only in a general manner, that the end of creation takes form [existat] in outmost things; which end is, that all things may return to the Creator, and that there may be conjunction. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #171 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
 171. Creatio ad ultimum hunc finem vadit continue per tria illa, quae sunt finis, causa, et effectus, quia in Domino Creatore tria illa sunt, ut mox supra dictum est; et Divinum est in omni spatio absque spatio, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_171/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_69" target=_top>69-72</a>, et in maximis et minimis idem, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_171/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_77" target=_top>77-82</a>; ex quo patet, quod universum creatum in communi progressione ad finem ultimum, sit finis medius respective; ex tellure enim a Domino Creatore elevantur continue formae usuum in suo ordine usque ad hominem, qui quoad corpus etiam inde est: homo dein elevatur per receptionem amoris et sapientiae a Domino; ac ut amorem et sapientiam recipiat, media omnia provisa sunt; ac talis est factus ut recipere possit, si modo velit. Ex nunc dictis videri potest, tametsi adhuc non nisi quam communiter, quod finis creationis existat in ultimis, qui est ut omnia redeant ad Creatorem, ac ut sit conjunctio. </p>
