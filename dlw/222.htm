<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">3.10 这两种层级存在于一切受造物中，无论最大的还是最小的</h4><p>222、一切受造物，无论最大的还是最小的，皆由离散层级和连续层级，或高度层级和广度层级构成；这一点无法通过取自可见物体的例子来说明，因为最小事物是肉眼看不见的，可见的最大事物似乎又不能划分为层级。因此，我们只能通过总体论证这个问题。天使就是凭总体获得智慧的，从而拥有关于细节的知识，因此我们也可以提出他们关于这些事的声明。</p>

222. There are levels of both kinds in everything that has been created, no matter how large or small. There is no way to offer visible examples of the fact that the largest and smallest things of all are made up of distinct and gradual, or vertical and horizontal, levels, because the smallest things that occur are not visible to our eyes and the largest do not seem to be marked off into levels. The only available way to explain this principle, then, is by looking to universal phenomena; and since angels are engaged in wisdom on the basis of universal principles and derive knowledge about details on that basis, I may offer some of the things they have said on the subject. </p>

222. Degrees of both kinds exist in the greatest and least of all created things. The fact that the greatest and least of all created things consist of discrete and continuous degrees, or degrees of height and degrees of breadth, cannot be illustrated by examples drawn from observable phenomena, because the most infinitesimal are not visible to the eyes, and the grandest that are visible do not appear to be distinguished into degrees. We can demonstrate this point, therefore, only by recourse to universal principles. Since angels have their wisdom from universal principles, and so possess a knowledge of particular instances, we may also present their declarations regarding these. </p>

222. THERE ARE DEGREES OF BOTH KINDS IN THE GREATEST AND THE LEAST OF ALL CREATED THINGS <p>That the greatest and the least of all things consist of discrete and continuous degrees, that is, degrees of height and of breadth, cannot be illustrated by examples from visible things because the least things are not Visible to the eyes, and the greatest things, which do stand out, do not appear to be distinguished into degrees. And on this account this matter does not allow of demonstration except by universals. And because angels are in wisdom from universals, and from that in knowledge of particulars, it is allowed to bring forward their utterances concerning these things. </p>

222. THERE ARE DEGREES OF BOTH KINDS IN THE GREATEST AND IN THE LEAST OF ALL CREATED THINGS. <p>That the greatest and the least of all things consist of discrete and continuous degrees, that is, of degrees of height and of breadth, cannot be illustrated by examples from visible objects, because the least things are not visible to the eyes, and the greatest things which are visible seem undistinguished into degrees; consequently this matter does not allow of demonstration otherwise than by universals. And since angels are in wisdom from universals, and from that in knowledge of particulars, it is allowed to bring forward their statements concerning these things. </p>

222. QUOD UTRIUSQUE GENERIS GRADUS SINT IN OMNIUM MAXIMIS ET MINIMIS QUAE CREATA SUNT. Quod omnium maxima et minima ex gradibus discretis et continuis, seu altitudinis et latitudinis consistant, non potest illustrari per exempla ex visibilibus, quia minima non exstant coram oculis, et maxima quae exstant, non distincta in gradus apparent; quapropter hanc rem non licet nisi quam per universalia demonstrare; et quia Angeli in sapientia ex universalibus sunt, et inde in scientia de singularibus, licet de his effata illorum proferre. </p>
