<h4 align="center"></h4><p>247、正因属灵之光流入心智的所有三个层级，人才有别于动物；因此，与动物相比，人能分析思考，能看见真理，不仅能看见属世真理，还能看见属灵真理；一看见它们，他就能承认它们，从而得以改造和重生。这种接受属灵之光的能力就是我们前面所说的理性的意思，每个人都从主那里拥有这种能力，它不会从他那里被夺走，因为如果它真的被夺走，人就无法被改造。正是由于被称为理性的这种官能，和动物不同，人不仅能思考，还能照自己的思维说话；然后，正是由于他的另一种被称为自由的官能，他能做那些他出于其理解力所思想的事。我们在前面(240节)论述了这两种官能，即人所特有的理性和自由，故在此不再赘述。</p>

247. We are differentiated from animals by the inflow of spiritual light into all three levels of our minds; and beyond what animals can do, we can think analytically; we can see things that are true not only on the earthly level but on the spiritual level as well; and when we see them, we can acknowledge them and so be reformed and regenerated. Our ability to accept spiritual light is what we call rationality, already discussed [<a href="240.htm" target=_top>240</a>]. It is a gift from the Lord to each one of us, and one that is not taken away, since if it were taken away, we could not be reformed. It is because of this ability called rationality that we not only can think but can say what we are thinking, which animals cannot do. Then because of that second ability called freedom, also discussed above, we can do what we have thought intellectually.<p>Since I dealt with these two abilities that we claim--rationality and freedom--in <a href="240.htm" target=_top>240</a>, there is no need to say more about them here. </p>

247. The influx of spiritual light into all three degrees of the mind distinguishes human beings from animals, so that the human being, in contrast to animals, can think analytically, see truths - not only natural truths but also spiritual truths - and on seeing them can acknowledge them and so be reformed and regenerated.<p>The faculty of receiving spiritual light is what we mean by rationality, which we remarked on previously, a faculty which every person has from the Lord, and which is not taken from him; for if it were taken from him, he could not be reformed.<p>It is owing to that faculty called rationality that a person not only can think, but can in accord with his thought also speak, unlike animals. And it is owing to his other faculty called freedom, which we also remarked on previously, that he can then do those things which he with his intellect thinks.<p>Because we discussed these two faculties, rationality and freedom - faculties which are peculiar to mankind - previously in no. <a href="240.htm">240</a>, we will therefore say no more about them here. </p>

247. By the influx of spiritual light into all three degrees of the mind man is distinguished from beasts. And man being in advance of beasts can think analytically, can see not only natural but also spiritual truths, and when he sees them he can acknowledge them and thus be reformed and regenerated. The capacity of receiving spiritual light is what is understood by rationality, mentioned above, which every man has from the Lord, and which is not taken away from him, for if it were taken away he could not be reformed. It is from that faculty, called rationality, that man, unlike beasts, is able not only to think, but also to speak from thought. Afterwards from his other faculty which is called freedom, also mentioned above, he is able to do these things which he thinks from his understanding. As these two faculties, rationality and freedom, which are proper to man have been treated of above (<a href="240.htm">240</a>), therefore nothing further will be said about them here. </p>

247. By the influx of spiritual light into all three degrees of the mind man is distinguished from beasts; and, as contrasted with beasts, he can think analytically, and see both natural and spiritual truth; and when he sees them he can acknowledge them, and thus be reformed and regenerated. This capacity to receive spiritual light is what is meant by rationality (referred to above), which every man has from the Lord, and which is not taken away from him, for if it were taken away he could not be reformed. From this capacity, called rationality, man, unlike the beasts, is able not only to think but also to speak from thought; and afterwards from his other capacity, called freedom (also referred to above), he is able to do those things that he thinks from his understanding. As these two capacities, rationality and freedom, which are proper to man, have been treated of above (n. <a href="240.htm" target=_top>240</a>), no more will be said about them here. </p>

247. Per influxum lucis spiritualis in omnes tres Gradus Mentis, homo distinguitur a bestiis, ac homo prae bestiis potest analytice cogitare, videre vera non solum naturalia sed etiam spiritualia, et cum videt illa potest agnoscere illa, et sic reformari et regenerari. Facultas recipiendi lucem spiritualem, est quae intelligitur per Rationalitatem, de qua supra, quae cuivis homini a Domino est, et quae ei non aufertur, nam si auferretur, non potuisset reformari: ex facultate illa, quae vocatur Rationalitas, est quod homo non solum possit cogitare, sed etiam ex cogitatione loqui, secus ac bestiae, et dein ex altera facultate ejus, quae vocatur Libertas, de qua etiam prius, potest facere illa quae ex intellectu cogitat. Quia de binis his facultatibus, Rationalitate et Libertate, quae homini propriae sunt, supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_247/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_240" target=_top>240</a> <sup>1</sup>
