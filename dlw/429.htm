<h4 align="center"></h4><p>429、另一方面，那些处于属灵-属世之爱的人，没有刻在他们生命上的智慧，也没有聪明，只有出于圣言的某种信仰元素，不过，前提是这信已经与仁结合。这些人因不知道何为仁，或他们的信是不是真理，故不能住在天上那些拥有智慧聪明的人中间，而是住在那些只拥有知识的人中间。但那些避恶如罪的人住在最低层天堂，在那里住在如夜晚的月光那样的光中。<br><br>然而，那些没有确认对未知之物的信仰，同时对真理怀有某种情感的人会接受天使的教导，并照着他们对真理的接受和照之的生活而被提入那些拥有属灵之爱，因而拥有聪明之人的社群。这些人变得属灵，而其余的仍是属灵-属世的。但那些生活在与仁分离之信的状态下的人则被驱逐并发送到沙漠中，因为他们没有处于任何良善，因而没有处于良善与真理的任何婚姻，而天堂里的所有人都处于良善与真理的婚姻。</p>

429. Some people, though, are moved by spiritual love on the earthly level. They do not have either wisdom or intelligence written on their lives, they simply have some element of faith drawn from the Word, to the extent that it is united to charity. Since they do not know what charity is or whether their faith is true, they cannot enjoy the company of people in the heavens, people who are occupied with wisdom and intelligence. They find themselves with people who are occupied simply with information. Still, if they have abstained from evils as sins, they are in the farthest heaven, where the light is like moonlight at night.<p>Then again, if they have not become set in a faith in the unknown and have felt some attraction to truths, once they have been taught by angels (as far as their openness to truths and to a life by them allows), they are brought up into communities of people who are moved by spiritual love and therefore live intelligently. They become spiritual, while the others remain spiritual only on an earthly level.<p>However, if people have lived in a faith that is separated from charity, they are sent away and relegated to desolate regions because they are not engaged in anything worthwhile. This means that they do not participate in any marriage of what is good and true, the marriage characteristic of everyone in the heavens. </p>

<p>429. On the other hand, people who are motivated by a natural spiritual love have engraved on their life neither wisdom nor intelligence, but instead some element of faith from the Word to the extent that this has been conjoined with charity.<p>Because people of this character do not know what charity is, or whether their faith is the truth, they cannot dwell among those in the heavens who possess wisdom and intelligence, but dwell among those who possess only knowledge.<p>Still, those who have refrained from evils as sins are in the lowest heaven, and dwell there in a light like the light of the moon at night.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Those, however, who have not confirmed themselves in a faith in the unknown, and at the same time have had some affection for truth, on being instructed by angels are, in accordance with their reception of truths and life according to them, elevated into the societies of people who possess a spiritual love and so intelligence. They become spiritual, while the rest remain naturally spiritual.<p>Conversely, those who have lived in a state of faith separated from charity are removed and sent off into deserts, because they are not impelled by any goodness, thus not by any marriage of goodness and truth, as are all those who are in the heavens. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #429 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>429. But those who live in spiritual-natural love have neither wisdom nor intelligence inscribed on their life, but have something of faith from the Word, so far as this has been conjoined with charity. Since these do not know what charity is, nor if faith be truth, they cannot be among those in the heavens who are in wisdom and in intelligence, but among those who are in knowledge only. Yet those who shun evils as sins dwell in the lowest heaven, and in light there which is like the light of the moon by night, while those who have not confirmed themselves in ignorant faith, but have at the same time cherished some affection for truth, having been instructed by angels so far as they can receive truths and live according to them, are raised into societies of those who dwell in spiritual love, and intelligence therefrom. Those become spiritual, the rest remain natural-spiritual. But those who have lived in faith separate from charity are removed and sent away into deserts because they are not in any good, thus not in any marriage of good and truth, in which all are who are in the heavens. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #429 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
429. But those who are in spiritual-natural love have neither wisdom nor intelligence inscribed on their life, but only something of faith out of the Word, so far as this has been conjoined with charity. Inasmuch as these do not know what charity is, or whether faith be truth, they cannot be among those in the heavens who are in wisdom and intelligence, but among those who are in knowledge only. Yet such of them as have fled from evil as sins are in the outmost heaven, and are in a light there like the light of the moon by night; while those who have not confirmed themselves in a faith in what is unknown, but have cherished a kind of affection for truth are instructed by angels, and according to their reception of truths and a life in agreement therewith, are raised into the societies of those who are in spiritual love and therefore in intelligence. Those become spiritual, the rest becoming spiritual-natural. But those who have lived in faith separate from charity are removed, and sent away into deserts, because they are not in any good, thus not in any marriage of good and truth, in which all are who are in the heavens. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #429 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>429. Illi autem qui in Amore naturali spirituali sunt, non habent sapientiam nec intelligentiam vitae suae inscriptam, sed habent aliquid fidei ex Verbo, quantum hoc charitati conjunctum est. Hi quia non sciunt quid charitas, nec an fides sit veritas, non possunt inter illos in Coelis esse, qui in sapientia et in intelligentia sunt, sed inter illos qui in sola scientia. At illi qui mala fugerunt ut peccata, in ultimo Coelo sunt, et ibi in luce simili luci nocturnae lunari.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Sed qui se non confirmaverunt in fide ignoti, et simul in aliqua affectione veri fuerunt, illi instructi ab angelis[,] secundum receptionem veritatum, ac vitam secundum illas, elevantur in societates illorum, qui in amore spirituali et <sup>1</sup>
inde intelligentia sunt; hi fiunt spirituales[;] reliqui manent naturales spirituales. Ast qui in fide separata a charitate vixerunt, removentur et ablegantur in deserta, quia non in aliquo bono sunt, ita non in aliquo conjugio boni et veri, in quo sunt omnes qui in coelis sunt. <p>
