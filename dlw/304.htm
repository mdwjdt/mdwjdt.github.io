<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第304节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>304、从受造宇宙中的一切事物的这种普遍起源中，它们各自获得相似的秩序；因为它们也是从其最初元素行进到其相对静止的最终或最外在的元素，以至于终止于其中，变得持久。人体纤维就是这样从其最初形式发出，直到最终变成肌腱；同样，纤维及其血管从其最初形式发出，直到变成软骨和骨头，使得它们可以停靠于其上，变得持久。由于人里面的纤维和血管从始至终的进程是这样的，所以它们的状态也遵循类似的进程。它们的状态就是感觉、思维和情感。这些也从其最初起源，就是它们处于光之状态所在的地方发出，一直行进到其最终或最外在的形式，就是它们处于相对黑暗的状态所在的地方，或从其最初起源，就是它们处于热之状态所在的地方发出，一直行进到其最终或最外在的形式，就是它们缺乏热所在的地方。由于这些的进程是这样的，所以爱及其一切和智慧及其一切的进程也是这样的。总之，受造宇宙中的一切事物的进程都是这样的。此处的观点和前面(222-229节)所论证的一样，即：一切受造物，无论最大的还是最小的，都有两种层级。这两种层级甚至存在于最小的事物中，因为根据天使的属灵观念(300节)，灵界太阳是唯一的一种物质，一切事物皆源于它。</p>

304. Because of this common origin of everything in the created universe, its smaller components have a similar characteristic. That is, they go from their beginning to their limits, limits that are in a relatively quiet state, in order to come to rest and persist. In the human body, this is how the fibers develop from their first forms until they become tendons, and the fibers together with their smaller vessels develop from their beginnings until they become cartilage and bone, where they become stable and durable.<p>Because there is this kind of process from beginnings to limits for our human fibers and vessels, there is a similar procession of the states of these fibers and vessels, their states being sensations, thoughts, and feelings. These too go through a sequence from their beginnings, where they are in the light, to their limits, where they are in darkness; or from their beginnings, where they are in warmth, to their limits, where they are not. Since they have this kind of progression, there is a similar progression for love and everything involved in it and for wisdom and everything involved in it. In short, this kind of progression is characteristic of everything in the created universe. This is just what I said in <a href="222.htm" target=_top>222-229</a> above, that there are levels of both kinds in everything that has been created, no matter how large or small.<p>The reason there are both kinds of level in even the smallest things is that the spiritual sun is the sole substance that gives rise to everything, according to the spiritual concepts of angels (<a href="300.htm" target=_top>300</a>). </p>

304. From this universal origin of all the constituents in the created universe, they each derive there the same characteristic, that they progress from their first element to their last elements which are relatively in a state of rest so as to terminate in them and abide.<p>Fibers in the human body thus proceed from their first forms until they become tendons, and likewise fibers with their vessels from their first forms until they become cartilages and bones, so as to rest on them and abide.<p>Because such is the progression from firsts to lasts of the fibers and vessels in a person, their states therefore follow a similar progression. Their states are sensations, thoughts, and affections. These, too, proceed from their first origins where they are in a state of light to their last forms where they are in a state of comparative darkness, or from their first origins where they are in a state of warmth to their last forms where they are lacking in warmth.<p>Now because such is the progression of these, such also is the progression of love and all its constituents, and of wisdom and all its constituents. In a word, such is the progression of all the constituents in the created universe.<p>The point here is the same as that demonstrated in nos. <a href="222.htm">222-229</a> above, that degrees of two kinds exist in the greatest and least of all created things.<p>The reason degrees of both kinds exist in the least of all things is that the spiritual sun is the one single substance from which springs all else, according to the spiritual ideas of angels (no. <a href="300.htm">300</a>). </p>

304. From this universal origin of all things in the created universe, individual things there have a similar origin in that they go forth from their first to ultimates which are relatively in a state of rest, that they may terminate and continue in existence. In the human body, therefore, fibres go forth from their first forms until at last they become tendons, also the fibres with vessels go forth from their first forms until they finally become cartilages and bones, upon which they may rest and continue in existence. Because there is such a progression of fibres and vessels in man from firsts to ultimates, there is a similar progression, therefore, of their states which are sensations, thoughts and affections. These also from their firsts which are in light go forth through to ultimates where they are in shade, or from their firsts where they are in heat to ultimates where they are not in heat. Because there is such a progression of these, there is also such a progression of love and all the things thereof, also of wisdom and all the things thereof. In a word, such is the progression of all things in the created universe. This is the same as was shown above (<a href="222.htm">222-229</a>), that there are degrees of both kinds in the greatest and least of all created things. There are degrees of both kinds even in the least things of all because the spiritual Sun is the sole substance from which all things are, according to the spiritual ideas of the angels (<a href="300.htm">300</a>). </p>

304. From this universal origin of all things in the created universe, every particular thereof has a similar order; in that these also go forth from their first to outmosts which are relatively in a state of rest, that they may terminate and become permanent. Thus in the human body fibers proceed from their first forms until at last they become tendons; also fibers with vessels proceed from their first forms until they become cartilages and bones; upon these they may rest and become permanent. Because of such a progression of fibers and vessels in man from firsts to outmosts, there is a similar progression of their states, which are sensations, thoughts, and affections. These, also, from their firsts, where they are in light, proceed through to outmosts, where they are in shade; or from their firsts, where they are in heat, to outmosts where they are not in heat. With such a progression of these there is also a like progression of love and of all things thereof, and of wisdom and all things thereof. In a word, such is the progression of all things in the created universe. This is the same as was shown above (n. <a href="222.htm" target=_top>222-229</a>), that there are degrees of both kinds in the greatest and least of all created things. There are degrees of both kinds even in the least things of all, because the spiritual sun is the sole substance from which all things are (according to the spiritual ideas of the angels, n. <a href="300.htm" target=_top>300</a>). </p>

304. Ex Universali hac origine omnium in Universo creato, trahunt singula ibi simile, quod a primo suo progrediantur ad ultima, quae respective in statu quietis sunt, ut desinant et subsistant: in Corpore humano ita vadunt fibrae a suis primis formis usque dum fiunt tendines, tum fibrae cum vasculis a suis primis usque dum fiunt cartilagines et ossa, <sup>1</sup>
super quibus quiescant et subsistant. Quia talis progressio a primis ad ultima est fibrarum et vasorum in homine, ideo est similis progressio statuum eorum; status eorum sunt sensationes, cogitationes, et affectiones; hae quoque a primis suis ubi sunt in luce pervadunt ad ultima, ubi sunt in umbra; seu a primis suis ubi sunt in calore ad ultima ubi non sunt in calore: et quia talis est progressio illarum, est quoque talis progressio amoris et omnium ejus, tum sapientiae et omnium ejus; verbo, talis est progressio omnium in Universo creato: hoc idem est cum hoc quod supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_304/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_222" target=_top>222-229</a> demonstratum est, quod duplicis generis gradus sint in omnium maximis et minimis quae creata sunt. Quod utriusque generis gradus etiam sint in omnium minimis, est quia Sol Spiritualis est unica substantia ex qua sunt omnia, secundum ideas spirituales Angelorum[,] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_304/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_300" target=_top>300</a>. <p>
