<h4 align="center"></h4><p>168、必须进一步知道，目的是原因中的一切，也是结果中的一切。正因如此，目的、原因和结果被称为最初目的、中间目的和最终目的。不过，目的要成为原因中的一切，必须有来自原因中的目的的某种东西，以便目的能居于其中。目的要成为结果中的一切，必须有来自经由原因而在结果中的目的的某种东西，以便目的能居于其中。因为目的不可能单独存在，必须存在于它所产生的事物中，它本身的一切都能居于其中，通过起作用而产生结果，直到它有恒久的存在。它恒久存在之处就是最终目的，被称为结果。</p>

168. We also need to realize that the purpose is the sum and substance of the means and also the sum and substance of the result. This is why we call the purpose, the means, and the result the first, intermediate, and final ends. For the purpose to be the sum and substance of the means, though, there needs to be something from the purpose in which it exists; and for it to be the sum and substance of the result there must be something from the purpose through the means in which it exists. A purpose cannot exist in itself alone, but must exist in something that takes place because of it, something in which it can dwell with its total being, something which it can accomplish by its effort as long as it lasts. The reality in which it "lasts" is that final end that is called its result. </p>

168. It must further be known that the end is everything in the cause and also everything in the effect. It is owing to this that end, cause and effect are called the first end, intermediate end, and last end.<p>However, for the end to be everything in the cause, something must exist from the end for it to dwell in, and for the end to be everything in the effect, something must exist from the end through the cause for it to dwell in. For an end cannot exist in itself alone, but must exist in something arising from it, in which it can be present as its everything and by acting produce effects until it rests. The terminus in which it rests is the last end, which is called the effect. </p>

<p>
168. It must be known besides that the end is the everything in the cause and the everything, too, in the effect. Hence it is that end, cause and effect are called first, middle and last end. But for the end to be everything in the cause, there must be something from the end in the cause wherein it must be. But so that the end may be everything in the effect, there must be something out of the end through the cause wherein the end must be. For the end cannot be in itself alone, but must be in something existing from it, in which it can indwell as to its entirety, and by acting, be effective even until it has a permanent existence. That in which it permanently exists is the last end, and this is called the effect. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #168 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
168. It must be known further, that the end is everything in the cause, and also everything in the effect; from this it is that end, cause, and effect, are called first end, middle end, and last end. But that the end may be everything in the cause, there must be something from the end [in the cause] wherein the end shall be; and that the end may be everything in the effect, there must be something from the end through the cause [in the effect] wherein the end shall be. For the end cannot be in itself alone, but it must be in something having existence from it, in which it can dwell as to all that is its own, and by acting, come into effect, until it has permanent existence. That in which it has permanent existence is the last end, which is called effect. </p>

<p>
168. Porro sciendum est, quod Finis sit omne in Causa, et quoque omne in effectu: inde est, quod Finis, Causa et Effectus, dicantur Finis primus, medius et ultimus. Sed ut Finis sit omne in causa, erit aliquid ex fine in quo erit, ac ut sit omne in effectu, erit aliquid ex fine per causam, in quo erit; finis enim non potest in se solo esse, sed erit in aliquo existente a se, cui quoad omne suum inesse potest et agendo efficere, usque dum subsistit; id in quo subsistit est Finis ultimus, qui vocatur Effectus. </p>
