<h4 align="center"></h4><p>132、由于显为太阳的主，因而东方在所有天堂天使面前，故可知，他们右边是南方；左边是北方；背面是西方；并且无论身体如何转动，始终这样。因为如前所述，在灵界，一切方位皆根据东方来确定；因此，那些东方在眼前的人其实就在这些方位，是他们自己决定了这些方位；因为如前所示(124-128节)，方位不是由显为太阳的主创造的，而是由天使照其接受创造的。</p>

132. Since the Lord as the sun and therefore the east is in front of all heaven's angels, it follows that the south is to their right, the north to their left, and the west behind them, again no matter which way they turn their bodies. That is, all the regions in the spiritual world are based on the east, as already stated [<a href="120.htm" target=_top>120</a>]. This means that people who have the east before their eyes are in those very regions and actually set their boundaries; since, as I have just explained in <a href="124.htm" target=_top>124-128</a>, the regions are not caused by the Lord as the sun but by the angels, according to their receptivity. </p>

<p>
132. Since angels in heaven all have the Lord as the sun - thus the east - in front of them, it follows that to their right is the south, to their left the north, and to their rear the west, and this continually in whatever direction they turn their body. For as we said before, all points of the compass in the spiritual world are determined in relation to the east. Consequently those for whom the east is before their eyes are in these zones - indeed, they are themselves what determine them; for as we showed above in nos. <a href="124.htm">124-128</a>, the zones are not created by the Lord as the sun, but by the angels in accordance with their reception. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #132 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
132. Since the Lord as a Sun, thus the east, is before the faces of all the angels of heaven, it follows that to their right is the south, and to the left the north, and behind them the west, thus even in every turning of their body. For, as said before, all the quarters in the spiritual world are determined from the east. Wherefore those who have the east before their eyes, are in these very quarters, indeed, are themselves what determines the quarters. For, as was shown above (<a href="124.htm">124-128</a>), the quarters are not from the Lord as a Sun, but from the angels according to reception. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #132 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
132. Since the Lord as a sun, consequently the east, is before the faces of all angels of heaven, it follows that to their right is the south; to their left the north; and behind them the west; and this, too, at every turn of the body. For, as was said before, all quarters in the spiritual world are determined from the east; therefore those who have the east before their eyes are in these very quarters, yea, are themselves what determine the quarters; for (as was shown above, n. <a href="124.htm" target=_top>124-128</a>) the quarters are not from the Lord as a sun, but from the angels according to reception. </p>

<p>
132. Quoniam Dominus ut Sol, ita Oriens, ante facies omnium Angelorum coeli est, sequitur quod ad dextrum illis sit meridies, ad sinistrum septentrio, et a tergo occidens, ita etiam in omni conversione corporis eorum; nam ut prius dictum est, omnes plagae in Mundo spirituali determinatae sunt ab oriente; quare illi, quibus Oriens est ante oculos, in ipsis plagis sunt, imo sunt ipsi determinationes illarum, nam ut supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_132/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_124" target=_top>124-128</a> <sup>1</sup>
ostensum est, plagae non sunt a Domino ut Sole, sed ab angelis secundum receptionem. <p>
