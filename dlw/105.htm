<h4 align="center"></h4><p>105、灵界太阳处在中间高度，主要有以下几个原因：首先，从这太阳发出的热与光可因此保持适中的强度，从而保持均等比例，由此被适当调和。因为如果这太阳高于中间高度，居民就会感觉热多于光；如果低于中间高度，居民就会感觉光多于热；正如地上当太阳高于或低于中空处时的情形；当过高时，热的增长超过光；当过低时，光的增长超过热。事实上，光在夏天和在冬天是一样的，但热却根据太阳的高度而增强或减弱。灵界太阳出现在天使天堂之上中间高度的第二个原因是：它使所有天使天堂都处于恒春气候，使天使处于平安的状态，因为这种状态对应于地上的春天。第三，它能让天使将脸始终转向主，举目仰望祂。因为天使无论身体转向何方，脸总是朝向东方，因而总是朝向主。这是灵界特有的现象。如果灵界太阳高于或低于中间高度，那是不可能实现的，如果出现在头顶上的正上方，那就更不可能了。</p>

105. The following are the primary reasons why the sun of the spiritual world is seen at a middle elevation. First, this means that the warmth and light that emanate from that sun are at their median level--they are of equal proportions, therefore, and appropriately moderate. That is, if the sun appeared above that middle elevation, angels would perceive more warmth than light, while if it appeared lower, they would perceive more light than warmth, as happens on earth when the sun is above or below the middle of the sky. When it is above, the warmth increases more than the light; and when it is below, the light increases more than the warmth. The light actually stays the same in summer and winter, but the warmth increases or decreases depending on the degree of the sun's height.<p>A second reason that the spiritual world's sun appears at a middle height above the angelic heaven is that this results in a constant springtime for all the angelic heavens. Consequently, angels are in a state of peace, for this state corresponds to springtime on earth.<p>A third reason is that it enables angels to turn their faces toward the Lord constantly and to see him with their eyes. For angels, the east--and therefore the Lord--is in front of them no matter which way they turn their bodies, which is a unique feature of their world. This would not happen if the sun of their world were above or below middle height, and it would be absolutely impossible if it were directly overhead. </p>

105. The sun in the spiritual world appears at a middle height chiefly for the following reasons:<p>First, the heat and light which emanate from that sun are then in their intermediate degree, and so are in balance and thus in their proper proportion. For if the sun were to appear above a middle height, the inhabitants would experience more heat than light; if it were to appear below it, the inhabitants would experience more light than heat - as is the case on earth when the sun stands above or below mid-height in the sky. When the sun stands above that point, heat increases over light, and when it stands below it, light increases over heat. In fact light remains the same in summertime and wintertime, but heat intensifies or lessens in accordance with the sun's degrees of altitude.<p>The second reason the sun in the spiritual world appears at a middle height over the angelic heaven is that it results in a climate of perpetual spring throughout the angelic heavens, so that the angels are in a state of peace; for this state corresponds to springtime on earth.<p>The third reason is that angels are thus able to turn their faces constantly to the Lord and behold Him with their eyes. For in whatever direction they turn their bodies angels have the east, thus the Lord, before their faces. This is a phenomenon peculiar to that world. It would not be possible if the sun in that world were to appear above or below mid-height, and not at all if it were to appear at the highest point above their head. </p>

105. The Sun of the spiritual world appears in the middle altitude chiefly for the following reasons. First, the heat and light which come forth from that Sun are thus in their middle degree, and hence in equal proportion and so are rightly tempered. For if the Sun appeared above the middle altitude, more heat than light would be perceived, and if below it, more light than heat would be perceived as happens on the earth when the sun is above or below the middle of the sky. When it is above, there is an increase of heat over light, but when below, an increase of light over heat; for light remains the same in summer and in winter, but heat increases or diminishes according to the degrees of the sun's altitude. The second reason that the Sun of the spiritual world appears in the middle altitude above the angelic heaven is that there is that perpetual spring in all the angelic heavens from which the angels are in a state of peace, for this state corresponds to springtime on earth. The third reason is that the angels are thus able to turn their faces continually towards the Lord and see Him with their eyes. For at every turn of their bodies the angels have the east, thus the Lord before their faces. This is peculiar to that world. This would not happen if the Sun of that world appeared above or below the middle, and least of all if it appeared overhead in the zenith. </p>

105. The sun of the spiritual world appears at a middle altitude chiefly for the following reasons: First, the heat and light which proceed from that sun are thus at their medium intensity, consequently are equally proportioned and thus properly attempered. For if the sun were to appear above the middle altitude more heat than light would be perceived, if below it more light than heat; as is the case on earth when the sun is above or below the middle of the sky; when above, the heat increases beyond the light, when below, the light increases beyond the heat; for light remains the same in summer and in winter, but heat increases and diminishes according to the degree of the sun's altitude. Secondly, the sun of the spiritual world appears in a middle altitude above the angelic heaven, because there is thus a perpetual spring in all the angelic heavens, whereby the angels are in a state of peace; for this state corresponds to springtime on earth. Thirdly, angels are thus enabled to turn their faces constantly to the Lord, and behold Him with their eyes. For at every turn of their bodies, the angels have the east, thus the Lord, before their faces. This is peculiar to that world, and would not be the case if the sun of that world were to appear above or below the middle altitude, and least of all if it were to appear overhead in the zenith. </p>

105. Quod Sol mundi Spiritualis appareat in media altitudine, sunt imprimis sequentes causae; PRIMA, quod sic Calor et Lux, quae procedunt ab illo Sole, sint in suo medio gradu, et inde in sua aequalitate, et sic in sua justa temperie; nam si Sol supra mediam altitudinem appareret, perciperetur plus caloris quam lucis; si infra illam, perciperetur plus lucis quam caloris; ut fit in terris dum Sol est supra aut infra medium Coeli; dum supra, crescit calor supra lucem, et dum infra, crescit lux supra calorem; lux enim manet eadem tempore aestatis et tempore hyemis, sed calor secundum gradus altitudinis Solis augetur et diminuitur. SECUNDA causa, quod Sol Mundi spiritualis in media altitudine supra Coelum Angelicum appareat, est, quia sic perpetuum ver est in omnibus coelis Angelicis, ex quo Angeli sunt in statu pacis, nam hic status correspondet tempori veris in terris. TERTIA causa est, quod sic Angeli facies suas ad Dominum jugiter possint vertere, et Ipsum oculis videre; Angelis enim in omni conversione corporis eorum est Oriens, ita Dominus, ante facies; quod peculiare est in illo Mundo: hoc non fieret, si Sol istius Mundi appareret supra aut infra medium, et minime si supra caput in zenith. </p>
