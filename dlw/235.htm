<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第235节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>235、我们已大体说了说高度层级的三重上升，然而却无法在此详细讨论这些层级，因为如前一章所述，这些层级存在于最大和最小事物中；只能说，爱的一切成分，由此而来的智慧的一切成分，以及来自这二者的功用的一切成分，里面都有这种层级。在主里面，所有这些层级都是无限的，而在天使和世人里面，它们都是有限的。不过，若不逐一加以阐述，就无法描述和解释这些层级如何存在于爱、智慧和功用中。</p>

235. I have said these things about the three-step ladder of vertical levels in generalizations; but since as stated in the preceding section these levels are characteristic of the largest and smallest things, I cannot say anything about them in detail at this point. I can say only that there are levels like this in everything that has to do with love and therefore in everything that has to do with wisdom, and that as a result there are levels like this in everything that has to do with usefulness. However, in the Lord they are all infinite, while in angels and in us they are finite. How these levels exist in love, wisdom, and use, though, can be described and unfolded only at some length. </p>

235. These observations regarding the threefold ascent of degrees of height are of a general character. Yet because these degrees exist in the greatest and least of things, as we said in the discussion immediately preceding, it is not possible for us to say something about them in particular here. This much only may be said, that there are degrees of this kind in each and all constituents of love, and therefore degrees of this kind in each and all constituents of wisdom, and consequently degrees of this kind in each and all constituents of useful endeavors - with the qualification, however, that in the Lord all these degrees are infinite, whereas in an angel or person they are finite. But how these degrees exist in love, wisdom and useful endeavors cannot be described and explained without taking them up one by one. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #235 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
235. These things have been said in general about the threefold ascent of the degrees of height. But because these degrees must be in greatest and in least things, as was said in a recently preceding section, it is not possible to say anything of them here in detail. This only may be said, that there are such degrees in each and in all things of love, and therefore in each and all things of wisdom, and therefrom in each and all things of use. But all these are infinite in the Lord, while in angel and in man they are finite. But how there are these three degrees in love, in wisdom and in uses cannot be described and unfolded except in series. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #235 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
235. Of the threefold ascent of the degrees of height this much has been said in general; but these degrees cannot here be discussed in detail, because (as was said in the preceding chapter) there must be these three degrees in things greatest and things least; this only need be said, that there are such degrees in each and all things of love, and therefrom in each and all things of wisdom, and from both of these in each and all things of use. In the Lord all these degrees are infinite; in angel and man they are finite. But how there are these three degrees in love, in wisdom, and in uses cannot be described and unfolded except in series. </p>

<p>
235. Haec de triplici ascensu Graduum altitudinis in genere dicta sunt, sed quia illi Gradus dantur in maximis et minimis, ut in mox praecedente Articulo dictum est, de illis non potest hic aliquid in specie dici; solum hoc, quod tales Gradus in omnibus et singulis Amoris, et inde tales Gradus in omnibus et singulis Sapientiae, et ex illis tales Gradus in omnibus et singulis usuum sint; sed quod omnes illi in Domino sint Infiniti, in angelo autem et in homine finiti. At quomodo Gradus illi sunt in amore, in sapientia, et in usibus, non potest describi et evolvi nisi in serie. </p>
