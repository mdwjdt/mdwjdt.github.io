<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">3.6 一切完美唯独随着层级并照着层级增加和上升</h4><p>199、我们在前面(185-188节)已说明，层级有两种，即广度层级与高度层级；还说明，广度层级就像从光到暗，或从智慧到无知的过程；而高度层级则像目的、原因和结果，或在先元素、随后元素和最终元素。论到高度层级，就说它们上升或下降，因为它们是高度层级。论到广度层级，就说它们增加或减少，因为它们是广度层级。这两种层级性质迥异，以致它们毫无共同之处。因此，我们必须分清它们，绝不可混淆。</p>

199. All processes of perfection increase and rise by and according to levels. I have already explained that there are two kinds of level, horizontal and vertical, in <a href="184.htm" target=_top>184-188</a> above. I have explained that the horizontal levels are like levels of light tending toward darkness or wisdom tending toward ignorance, while vertical levels are like those of a purpose, a means, and a result, or like something antecedent, something subsequent, and something final. These latter levels are described as rising and falling, since they involve height; while the former are described as waxing and waning because they involve width.<p>These levels are so different from each other that they have nothing in common; so they need to be grasped clearly and not confused with each other in any way. </p>

199. All perfections increase and ascend concomitantly with degrees and in accordance with them. We showed above in nos. <a href="184.htm">184-188</a> that degrees are of two kinds, degrees of breadth and degrees of height; and that degrees of breadth are like those in the progression of light to dark or of wisdom to ignorance, while degrees of height are like end, cause and effect, or like prior, subsequent and last elements. We say of these latter degrees that they ascend or descend, because they are degrees of height. Of the former, however, we say that they increase or decrease, because they are degrees of breadth.<p>These two kinds of degrees are so different in character that they have nothing in common. Consequently they must be distinctly perceived and not in the least way be confused. </p>

199. ALL PERFECTIONS INCREASE AND ASCEND ALONG WITH DEGREES AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEM <p>It has been shown above that there are two kinds of degrees, degrees of breadth and degrees of height (<a href="184.htm">184-188</a>); also that degrees of breadth are like those of light verging towards shade, or of wisdom towards ignorance; but that degrees of height are like end, cause and effect, or like first, second and last. It is said of the latter degrees that they ascend or descend, for they pertain to height; but of the former it is said that they increase or decrease, for they pertain to breadth. These degrees differ so much from each other that they have nothing in common. They are therefore to be perceived as distinct, and by no means to be confounded. </p>

<p>
199. ALL PERFECTIONS INCREASE AND ASCEND ALONG WITH DEGREES AND ACCORDING TO THEM. <p>That degrees are of two kinds, degrees of breadth and degrees of height has been shown above (n. <a href="184.htm" target=_top>185-188</a>); also that degrees of breadth are like those of light verging to shade, or of wisdom verging to ignorance; but that degrees of height are like end, cause and effect, or like prior, subsequent and final. Of these latter degrees it is said that they ascend or descend, for they are of height; but of the former that they increase or decrease for they are of breadth. These two kinds of degrees differ so much that they have nothing in common; they should therefore be perceived as distinct, and by no means be confounded. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #199 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
199. QUOD OMNES PERFECTIONES CRESCANT ET ASCENDANT CUM GRADIBUS ET SECUNDUM ILLOS. Quod duplicis generis gradus sint, gradus latitudinis et gradus altitudinis, supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_199/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_184" target=_top>184-188</a>, ostensum est; et quod gradus latitudinis sint sicut lucis vergentis ad umbram, aut sicut sapientiae ad ignorantiam; at quod gradus altitudinis sint sicut finis, causa et effectus, aut sicut prius, posterius et postremum: de his Gradibus dicitur quod ascendant aut descendant, sunt enim altitudinis; de illis autem dicitur quod crescant aut decrescant, sunt enim latitudinis. Hi gradus ab illis tantum differunt, ut nihil commune habeant, quare distincte percipiendi sunt, ac minime confundendi. </p>
