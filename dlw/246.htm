<h4 align="center"></h4><p>246、这种属灵之热只有通过避恶如罪，同时仰望主才能获得。因为只要人陷在邪恶里，也就陷在了对它们的爱里，受邪恶情欲驱使；对邪恶的爱及其情欲就居于一种反对属灵之爱和情感的爱里面。这种爱或情欲只有通过避恶如罪才能被移除；人因无法靠自己避开邪恶，只能靠主，故必须仰望主。所以，当他靠主避开邪恶时，对邪恶的爱及其热就被移除，对良善的爱及其热则被引入以取而代之，更高层级由此被打开。因为主从上面流入，打开这个层级，同时将属灵之爱，或属灵之热与属灵智慧，或属灵之光结合起来；人因着该结合而开始像春天的树一样在灵性上茁壮成长。</p>

246. The only way to gain that spiritual warmth is by abstaining from evils as sins and then turning to the Lord, since as long as we are caught up in evil pursuits we are caught up in a love for them. We are enmeshed in our cravings for them; and that love for what is evil, that craving, is a form of love that is opposed to spiritual love and desire. Further, the only way to get rid of that love or craving is by abstaining from evils as sins; and since we cannot do that on our own, but only by the Lord's agency, we need to turn to him. When we do abstain from our evils by the Lord's agency, then, our love for evil and its warmth are put aside and a love for what is good, with its warmth, is brought in in its place, enabling a higher level to be opened. The Lord actually flows in from above and opens it and unites the love or spiritual warmth with wisdom or spiritual light. As a result of this union we begin to blossom spiritually like a tree in springtime. </p>

246. This spiritual warmth can be acquired only by refraining from evils as being sins and at the same time by looking to the Lord. For as long as a person is caught up in evils, he is also caught up in a love for them, being driven by a lust for them, and a love of evil and its lust are prompted by a love opposed to spiritual love and affection. This love or lust cannot be removed except by refraining from evils as being sins; and because a person cannot refrain from them on his own but from the Lord, he must therefore look to the Lord.<p>Consequently when a person refrains from evils and does so from the Lord, then the love of evil and its warmth are removed, and in their stead are introduced a love of good and its warmth, by which the higher degree is opened. For the Lord flows in from above and opens it, and at the same time joins spiritual love or warmth to spiritual wisdom or light; and as a result of that union the person begins to blossom spiritually, like a tree in springtime. </p>

<p>
246. This spiritual heat is obtained only by shunning evils as sins, and at the same time looking to the Lord. For so long as a man is in evils he is also in the love of them, because he lusts after them, and the love of evil or lust is a love contrary to spiritual love and affection. And this love or lust can be removed only by shunning evils as sins, and because a man cannot shun evils from himself, but from the Lord, therefore he must look to Him. When therefore he shuns these from the Lord, then the love of evil with its heat is removed, and in place of it, the love of good with its heat is introduced, and by this means a higher degree is opened. For the Lord flows in from above and opens it, and then conjoins love, or spiritual heat, to wisdom or spiritual light. From this conjunction the man begins to flourish spiritually, like a tree in springtime. </p>

<p>
246. This spiritual heat is obtained only by fleeing from evils as sins, and at the same time looking to the Lord; for so long as man is in evils he is also in the love of them, for he lusts after them; and the love of evil and the lust, abide in a love contrary to spiritual love and affection; and such love or lust can be removed only by fleeing from evils as sins; and because man cannot flee from evils from himself, but only from the Lord. He must look to the Lord. So when he flees from evils from the Lord, the love of evil and its heat are removed, and the love of good and its heat are introduced in their stead, whereby a higher degree is opened; for the Lord flowing in from above opens that degree, and then conjoins love, that is, spiritual heat, to wisdom or spiritual light, from which conjunction man begins to flourish spiritually, like a tree in spring-time. </p>

<p>
246. Calor ille spiritualis non aliter comparatur, quam per fugere mala ut peccata, et tunc spectare ad Dominum; nam quamdiu homo in malis est, etiam in amore illorum est, est enim in concupiscentia ad illa, ac amor mali et concupiscentia est in amore opposito amori et affectioni spirituali, ac ille amor seu concupiscentia non potest removeri quam per fugere mala ut peccata; et quia homo non potest fugere illa a se sed a Domino, ideo spectabit <sup>1</sup>
ad Ipsum: quum itaque fugit illa a Domino, tunc amor mali et calor ejus removetur, et loco ejus infertur amor boni et calor ejus, per quem aperitur Gradus superior: Dominus enim a superiori influit, et aperit illum, et tunc conjungit amorem seu calorem spiritualem sapientiae seu luci spirituali, ex qua conjunctione homo spiritualiter florere incipit, sicut arbor tempore veris. <p>
