<h4 align="center"></h4><p>183、由于大气是热和光的载体和传送器，故可推知，大气的层级与热和光的层级一样多，也与爱和智慧的层级一样多。大气有好多种，它们因层级而彼此不同，这一点已通过灵界的大量经历向我显明，尤其通过以下事实：低层天堂的天使在高层天使所住的地区无法呼吸，看似喘不过气来，就像活物从空气被提出来进入以太，或从水中被提出来进入空气。此外，天堂之下的灵人看似在一种云里或雾中。大气有好多种，它们因层级而彼此不同(可参看176节)。</p>

183. Since the atmospheres are what receive and hold warmth and light, it follows that there are as many levels of atmosphere as there are of warmth and light--as many, that is, as there are levels of love and wisdom. An abundance of experience in the spiritual world has shown me that there are several atmospheres, distinguished from each other by level. One kind of experience was especially convincing, namely that angels of lower heavens cannot breathe in the realm of higher angels. They seem to labor for breath like creatures taken out of the air into the ether, or like creatures taken out of the water into the air. Then too, the spirits below heaven look as though they were in a cloud.<p>On the existence of several atmospheres distinguished from each other by levels, see <a href="176.htm" target=_top>176</a> above. </p>

183. Since atmospheres are the vehicles and conveyers of heat and light, it follows that there are as many degrees of atmospheres as there are degrees of heat and light, and as many also as there are degrees of love and wisdom.<p>The existence of a number of atmospheres, distinct from each other by degrees, has become apparent to me from a great deal of experience in the spiritual world. It has become apparent especially from the fact that angels of the lower heavens cannot breathe in the region inhabited by higher angels, and that they appear to themselves to gasp for breath, as commonly happens with creatures that are raised from the air into the ether, or with creatures that are raised from bodies of water into the air. Moreover, spirits beneath the heavens appear as if in a mist.<p>That there exist a number of atmospheres, distinct from each other by degrees, may be seen above in no. <a href="176.htm">176</a>. </p>

183. Since the atmospheres are receptacles and containants of heat and light, it follows that there are as many degrees of atmospheres as there are degrees of heat and light, and also that there are as many as there are degrees of love and wisdom. That there are several atmospheres, and that these are distinct from each other by means of degrees, has been made clear to me by much experience in the spiritual world, especially from this, that angels of the lower heavens cannot breathe in the region of the higher angels, and appear to themselves to gasp for breath as living creatures do when raised out of air into ether, or out of water into air. Besides, spirits below the heavens appear as if in a cloud. That there are several atmospheres, and that they are distinct from each other by means of degrees, may be seen above,<a href="176.htm">176</a>. </p>

183. Since atmospheres are the receptacles and containants of heat and light, it follows that there are as many degrees of atmospheres as there are degrees of heat and light; also that there are as many as there are degrees of love and wisdom. That there are several atmospheres, and that these are distinct from each other by means of degrees, has been manifested to me by much experience in the spiritual world; especially from this, that angels of the lower heavens are not able to breathe in the region of higher angels, and appear to themselves to gasp for breath, as living creatures do when they are raised out of air into ether, or out of water into air. Moreover, spirits below the heavens appear in a kind of cloud. That there are several atmospheres, and that they are distinct from each other by means of degrees, may be seen above (n. <a href="176.htm" target=_top>176</a>). </p>

183. Quoniam Athmosphaerae sunt receptacula et continentia caloris et lucis, sequitur quod totidem gradus athmosphaerarum sint, quot sunt gradus caloris et lucis, et quoque quod totidem, quot sunt gradus amoris et sapientiae. <sup>1</sup>
Quod plures Athmosphaerae sint, et illae inter se per gradus distinctae, patuit mihi a pluri experientia in Mundo spirituali; ex hac imprimis, quod Angeli inferiorum coelorum in regione angelorum superiorum non possint respirare, et quod appareant sibi trahere animam sicut solent viventia quae ab aere in aetherem elevantur, aut sicut viventia quae ab aquis in aerem; etiam Spiritus infra coelos apparent sicut in nimbo. Quod plures athmosphaerae sint, et illae per gradus inter se distinctae, videatur supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_183/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_176" target=_top>176</a>. <p>
