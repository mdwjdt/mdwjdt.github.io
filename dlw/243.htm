<h4 align="center"></h4><p>243、理解力能被提升至天堂之光，也就是天使的智慧，而意愿无法被提升至天堂之热，也就是天使的爱，除非人避恶如罪并仰望主，这一点已通过灵界经历向我清楚显明。我经常看见并发觉，那些只知道有一位神，主曾生而为人，别的几乎什么也不知道的简单灵人，充分理解天使智慧的奥秘，几乎与天使无异。不仅这些简单灵人，就连许多魔鬼团伙也是如此。然而，他们听见这些事时能明白它们，但在自己里面思考时则不能。因为当他们听见这些事时，光从上面进入；而当他们在自己里面思考时，除了对应于他们的热或爱的光之外，其它光无法进入。因此，当他们听见并明白这些奥秘时，一转移注意力，就什么也不记得了。事实上，那些属魔鬼团伙的人甚至厌恶地弃绝这些事，全然否认它们，因为他们的爱之火及其光是虚幻的，在他们里面造成黑暗，从上面进入的天堂之光便被这黑暗熄灭了。</p>

<p>
243. It has become abundantly clear to me from my experiences in the spiritual world that our discernment can be raised up into heaven's light, or into angelic wisdom, but that our volition cannot be raised up into heaven's warmth or angelic love unless we abstain from evils as sins and turn to the Lord. I have often seen and sensed that very ordinary spirits who knew only that God exists and that the Lord was born as a human--hardly anything else--understood the mysteries of angelic wisdom completely, almost the way angels do. Nor were they the only ones. Even many members of the demonic mob understood. They understood while they were listening, that is, but not in their private thinking. When they were listening, light flowed into them from above; but in their private thinking the only light that could get in was the light that agreed with their warmth or love. So even after they had heard these mysteries and grasped them, when they turned their hearing away they retained nothing. In fact, the members of the devil's mob spat it out and denied it categorically. The reason was that the fire of their love and its light, being mindless, brought down a darkness that snuffed out the heavenly light that was flowing in from above. </p>

243. The fact of this - that a person's intellect may be elevated into the light of heaven, or into angelic wisdom, but that his will cannot be elevated into the warmth of heaven or into angelic warmth unless he refrains from evils as being sins and looks to the Lord - has been made plainly apparent to me from experience in the spiritual world.<p>I have often seen simple spirits who knew only that there is a God and that the Lord was born a man, and scarcely anything else, and I have perceived that they fully understood the secrets of angelic wisdom, almost as angels do. And not only they, but also many of the devil's crew. Yet they understood these things when they heard them, and not when they thought to themselves. For when they heard them, a light entered in from above, but when they thought to themselves, then no other light could enter than such as corresponded to their warmth or love. Consequently, after they heard these secrets and comprehended them, upon turning their attention away they retained nothing. Indeed, those who were of the devil's crew then rejected these things and utterly denied them. The reason was that the fire of their love and its light, being an illusory fire and light, induced in them a darkness by which the heavenly light entering in from above was extinguished. </p>

<p>
243. It has been made clearly evident to me from experience in the spiritual world that the understanding can be elevated into the light of heaven, that is, into angelic wisdom, and that man's will cannot be raised into the heat of heaven, that is, into angelic love, unless he shuns evils as sins and looks to the Lord. Many times I have seen and perceived that spirits who knew merely that God is, and that the Lord was born a Man, but scarcely knew anything else, understood the arcana of angelic wisdom, almost as angels do; but not only these simple spirits, but also many of the infernal crew. They understood when they heard, but not when they thought within themselves. For when they heard, light entered from above, but when they thought within themselves, no other light could enter except that which corresponded to their heat or love. And therefore after they heard these arcana and perceived them, whenever they turned their ears away, they remembered nothing. Indeed those who were of the infernal crew then rejected those things with disgust and completely denied them. The reason for this was that the fire of their love and its light, being fatuous, induced darkness by which the heavenly light entering from above was extinguished. </p>

<p>
243. That the understanding can be raised into the light of heaven, that is, into angelic wisdom, while the will cannot be raised into the heat of heaven, that is, into angelic love, unless man flees from evils as sins and looks to the Lord, has been made plainly evident to me from experience in the spiritual world. I have frequently seen and perceived that simple spirits, who knew merely that God is and that the Lord was born a man, and who knew scarcely anything else, clearly apprehended the arcana of angelic wisdom almost as the angels do; and not these simple ones alone, but many also of the infernal crew. These, while they listened, understood, but not when they thought within themselves; for while they listened, light entered from above, and when they thought within themselves, no light could enter except that which corresponded to their heat or love; consequently when they had listened to and perceived these arcana, as soon as they turned their ears away they remembered nothing, those belonging to the infernal crew even rejecting these things with disgust and utterly denying them, because the fire of their love and its light, being delusive, induced darkness, by which the heavenly light entering from above was extinguished. </p>

<p>
243. Quod Intellectus possit elevari in lucem Coeli, seu in sapientiam angelicam, et quod voluntas ejus non possit elevari in calorem Coeli seu in amorem angelicum, nisi fugiat mala ut peccata, et spectet ad Dominum, evidenter mihi patuit ab experientia in Mundo Spirituali; pluries vidi et percepi, quod Spiritus simplices, qui modo sciverunt quod Deus sit, et quod Dominus natus sit homo, et vix aliquid praeterea, arcana sapientiae angelicae plene intellexerint, paene sicut Angeli; nec solum illi, sed etiam plures ex diabolica turba; at intellexerunt quando audiverunt, non autem quando secum cogitaverunt; nam cum audiverunt, intrabat lux a superiori, cum autem secum cogitaverunt, tunc non alia lux potuit intrare, quam quae correspondebat calori seu amori illorum; quare etiam postquam audiverunt illa arcana, et perceperunt illa, dum averterunt aures, nihil retinuerunt; imo illi qui e diabolica turba erant, tunc respuerunt illa et prorsus negaverunt; causa erat, quia ignis amoris illorum et lux ejus, quae fatua erant, induxerunt tenebras, per quas Lux coelestis e superiori intrans exstinguebatur. </p>
