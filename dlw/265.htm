<h4 align="center"></h4><p>265、邪恶的根源来自对这些官能的滥用，这一点将按以下顺序来解释：<br><br>⑴恶人和善人同等地享有这两种官能。<br><br>⑵恶人滥用这些官能来确认邪恶和虚假，而善人则用它们来确认良善和真理。<br><br>⑶被确认的邪恶和虚假会永远留在人里面，并成为他的爱，因而成为他生命的一部分。<br><br>⑷已经成为爱和生命的一部分的品质会遗传给后代。<br><br>⑸一切邪恶，无论先天的，还是后天的，都在属世心智中占据一席之地。</p>

265. The origin of evil in the abuse of these abilities will be presented in the following sequence.<p>1. Evil people, like good people, enjoy these two abilities.<p>2. Evil people misuse them to validate things that are evil and false, while good people use them to validate things that are good and true.<p>3. The evil and false things that we have validated stay with us, becoming part of our love and therefore of our life.<p>4. Things that have become part of our love and life are passed on to our offspring.<p>5. All evil characteristics, whether inherited or acquired, reside in the earthly mind. </p>

265. That the origin of evil comes from abuse of these faculties will be explained according to the following outline:<p>(1) An evil person possesses these two faculties just as much as a good one.<p>(2) An evil person abuses these faculties to defend evils and falsities, whereas a good person uses them to defend goods and truths.<p>(3) Confirmed evils and falsities remain in a person and become matters of his love and so of his life.<p>(4) Qualities that have become matters of one's love and life are passed on hereditarily to offspring.<p>(5) All evils, both those inborn and those additionally acquired, have their seat in the natural mind. </p>

265. That the origin of evil arises from the abuse of these capacities will be declared in this order: <p>(i) A bad man equally with a good man enjoys these two capacities. <p>(ii) A bad man abuses them to confirm evils and falsities, while a good man uses them to confirm goods and truths. <p>(iii) Confirmed evils and falsities with man are permanent, and come to be of his love, and consequently of his life. <p>(iv) Such things as have come to be of the love and life are engendered in offspring. <p>(v) All evils, both engendered and acquired, have their seat in the natural mind. </p>

265. Quod origo mali sit ex abusu illarum facultatum, dicetur in hoc ordine. <sup>1</sup>
. Quod malus homo aeque ac bonus duabus illis facultatibus gaudeat. 2. Quod malus homo abutatur illis ad confirmandum mala et falsa, ac quod bonus homo utatur illis ad confirmandum bona et vera. 3. Quod mala et falsa confirmata apud hominem permaneant, ac fiant amoris et inde vitae ejus. 4. Quod illa quae facta sunt amoris et vitae, ingenerentur proli. 5. Quod omnia mala tam ingenerata quam superinducta in Mente1 naturali resideant. <p>
