<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">2.12 每个灵人，无论其品质如何，都以同样的方式转向他的主导爱</h4><p>140、有必要先解释一下何为灵人，何为天使。死后，每个人首先进入天堂与地狱中间的灵人界，在那里度过自己的时日，也就是自己的状态，照其生命或为天堂或为地狱做好准备。只要留在灵人界，他就被称为灵人。从灵人界被提入天堂的，被称为天使；被投入地狱的，被称为撒旦或魔鬼。当这些灵人在灵人界时，为天堂作准备的，被称为天使灵；为地狱作准备的，被称为地狱灵。在此期间，天使灵与天堂相联，地狱灵与地狱相联。在灵人界，所有灵人都依附于人；因为就其心智的内层而言，人在天堂与地狱之间，并照自己的生活通过这些灵人或与天堂相通，或与地狱相通。值得一提的是，灵人界是一回事，灵界是另一回事；刚才所说的是灵人界；而灵界包括灵人界、天堂和地狱。</p>

140. Every kind of spirit turns toward her or his ruling love in the same way. First I need to define "angel" and "spirit." Immediately after death we come into a world of spirits that is halfway between heaven and hell. There we work through our stretches of time, or our states, and are prepared either for heaven or for hell, depending on the way we have lived. As long as we stay in this world, we are called "spirits." Anyone who has been brought up from this world into heaven is called an angel, and anyone who has been cast into hell is called a satan or a devil. As long as we are in the world of spirits, people who are being readied for heaven are called angelic spirits, and people who are being readied for hell are called hellish spirits. All the while, angelic spirits are united to heaven and hellish spirits to hell.<p>All the spirits who are in the world of spirits are together with us because we are similarly between heaven and hell as to the deeper levels of our minds. Through these spirits we are in touch with either heaven or hell, depending on the way we are living.<p>It should be clear that "the world of spirits" is not the same thing as "the spiritual world." The world of spirits is the one I have just been talking about, while the spiritual world includes that world, heaven, and hell. </p>

140. Every spirit of every kind turns in like manner to his dominant love. We must first define what we mean by a spirit and what we mean by an angel.<p>Every person after death comes first into the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, and there he spends his days (or states) being prepared in accordance with his life either for heaven or for hell.<p>As long as he remains in that world he is called a spirit. A spirit who has been raised from that world into heaven is called an angel. One who has been cast down into hell is called a satanic spirit or devil.<p>While these spirits are in the world of spirits, one who is being prepared for heaven is called an angelic spirit, and one who is being prepared for hell is called a hellish or infernal spirit. An angelic spirit is in the meantime conjoined with heaven, and a hellish spirit with hell.<p>All spirits who are in the world of spirits are attached to people, because in respect to the interior elements of their mind people are likewise between heaven and hell, and through those spirits they have, in accordance with their life, communication with heaven or with hell.<p>The reader should be aware that the world of spirits and the spiritual world are not interchangeable terms. The world of spirits is the world of which we have just spoken. The spiritual world, on the other hand, includes in its entirety both that world and heaven and hell. </p>

140. EVERY SPIRIT, WHATEVER HIS CHARACTER, TURNS IN LIKE MANNER TOWARDS HIS RULING LOVE <p>It will first be stated what a spirit is and what an angel is. Every man after death comes first of all into the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, and there passes his times, that is, his states, and according to his life, is prepared either for heaven or for hell. So long as he remains in that world, he is called a spirit. He who has been raised up from that world into heaven, is called an angel, but he who has been cast down into hell is called a satan or a devil. While these are in the world of spirits, he who is being prepared for heaven is called an angelic spirit, but he who is being prepared for hell, an infernal spirit. In the meantime, the angelic spirit is conjoined with heaven, and the infernal spirit with hell. All spirits who are in the world of spirits are adjoined to men, because men as to the interiors of the mind are in like manner between heaven and hell, and through these spirits, communicate with heaven or with hell according to their life. It ought to be known that the world of spirits is one thing and the spiritual world another. The world of spirits is that which has just been spoken of; but the spiritual world includes that world as well as heaven and hell. </p>

140. EVERY SPIRIT, WHATEVER HIS QUALITY, TURNS IN LIKE MANNER TO HIS RULING LOVE. <p>It shall first be explained what a spirit is, and what an angel is. Every man after death comes, in the first place, into the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, and there passes through his own times, that is, his own states, and becomes prepared, according to his life, either for heaven or for hell. So long as one stays in that world he is called a spirit. He who has been raised out of that world into heaven is called an angel; but he who has been cast down into hell is called either a satan or a devil. So long as these continue in the world of spirits, he who is preparing for heaven is called an angelic spirit; and he who is preparing for hell, an infernal spirit; meanwhile the angelic spirit is conjoined with heaven, and the infernal spirit with hell. All spirits in the world of spirits are adjoined to men; because men, in respect to the interiors of their minds, are in like manner between heaven and hell, and through these spirits they communicate with heaven or with hell according to their life. It is to be observed that the world of spirits is one thing, and the spiritual world another; the world of spirits is that which has just been spoken of; but the spiritual world includes that world, and heaven and hell. </p>

140. QUOD UNUSQUISQUE SPIRITUS, QUALISCUNQUE SIT, AD AMOREM SUUM REGNANTEM SIMILITER SE VERTAT. Quid spiritus et quid angelus primum dicetur: omnis homo post mortem primum in Mundum spirituum, qui est medius inter Coelum et Infernum, venit, et ibi agit sua tempora seu suos status, et secundum vitam suam praeparatur vel ad Coelum vel ad Infernum: quamdiu in illo Mundo moratur, vocatur ille spiritus; qui ex illo Mundo elevatus est in Coelum, ille vocatur Angelus; qui autem dejectus est in Infernum, vocatur satanas vel diabolus: quamdiu iidem in Mundo spirituum sunt, vocatur ille qui praeparatur ad Coelum Spiritus angelicus, et qui ad Infernum Spiritus infernalis: Spiritus angelicus interea conjunctus est cum Coelo, ac Spiritus infernalis cum Inferno. Omnes Spiritus, qui in Mundo spirituum sunt, adjuncti sunt hominibus, quia homines quoad interiora mentis suae similiter inter Coelum et Infernum sunt, et per spiritus illos communicant cum Coelo vel cum Inferno, secundum vitam. Sciendum est, quod aliud sit MUNDUS SPIRITUUM et aliud MUNDUS SPIRITUALIS[;] Mundus spirituum est ille de quo nunc dictum est; Mundus autem spiritualis est in complexu et ille Mundus et Coelum et Infernum. </p>
