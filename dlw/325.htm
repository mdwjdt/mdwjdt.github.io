<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第325节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>325、由于宇宙万物都与一个人的形像有关，所以亚当的智慧和聪明被描述为伊甸园，其中有各样的树木，还有河流、宝石、黄金，以及由亚当取名的各种动物。这一切事物都表示诸如在亚当里面，并构成那被称为人的存在之物或品质。论及亚述的事物(以西结书31:3-9)几乎一样；亚述象征性地表示教会的聪明；论及推罗的事物(以西结书28:12, 13)也一样，推罗象征性地表示教会对良善和真理的概念。</p>

325. Since there is a human image to everything in the universe, Adam's wisdom and intelligence are described by the garden of Eden, where there were trees of every kind, as well as rivers, precious stones, and gold, along with the animals that he named. All of these meant things that were within him and that made him what we call "human."<p>Quite similar things are said of Assyria in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_31_3.htm" target=_top>Ezekiel 31:3-9</a>, meaning the church as far as its intelligence is concerned, and about Tyre in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm" target=_top>Ezekiel 28:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_28_23.htm" target=_top>23</a> [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_28_13.htm" target=_top>13</a>], meaning the church in regard to its firsthand knowledge of what is good and true. </p>

325. Since all constituents of the universe resemble in an image the human being, Adam is described in respect to his wisdom and intelligence by the garden of Eden, which had in it trees of every kind, and also rivers, precious stones and gold, and moreover animals, to which Adam gave names. By all of these things are meant the qualities which he had in him and which constituted the being that we call man.<p>Assyria is described in very similar terms in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_31_3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-9</a>, by which is symbolically meant the church in respect to its intelligence. So, too, Tyre in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-13</a>, by which is symbolically meant the church in respect to its concepts of goodness and truth. </p>

<p>
325. Since all things of the universe have relation in an image to man, Adam as to wisdom and intelligence is described by the "garden of Eden" wherein were all kinds of trees, also rivers, precious stones and gold, as well as animals to which he gave names. By all these are understood such things as were in Adam, constituting that which is called man. Almost the same things are said of Ashur (in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_31_3.htm">Ezek 31:3-9</a>) by whom the Church as to intelligence is signified, and of Tyre (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezek 28:12-13</a>) by which the Church as to cognitions of good and truth is signified. </p>

325. Quoniam omnia universi in imagine referunt hominem, Adamus quoad sapientiam ac intelligentiam describitur per Hortum Edenis, in quo arbores omnis generis, et quoque fluvii, lapis pretiosus et aurum, tum animalia, quibus dedit nomina, per quae omnia intelliguntur talia quae apud illum erant, et faciebant id quod vocatur homo. Paene similia dicuntur de Aschure apud Ezechielem <sup>1</sup>
