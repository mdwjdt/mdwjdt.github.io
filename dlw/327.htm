<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">4.9 主所创造的一切事物皆为功用，就它们与人有关，并通过人与它们所源于的主有关的秩序、层级和方面而言，它们就是功用</h4><p>327、对此，前面已说明：除了功用外，没有什么东西能从神造物主那里产生(308节)；一切受造物的功用皆按层级从最低的受造形式上升到人类，再通过人类上升到它们所源于的神造物主那里(65-68节)；创造的目的在它的最终形式中得到表达，这目的就是使一切事物都能返回到造物主那里，使结合能发生(167-172节)；就事物关注创造者而言，它们就是功用(307节)；神性必在它所创造的其它事物中存在和显现(47-51节)；宇宙万物照功用而成为接受者，这一切皆照着层级(58节)；从功用的角度看，宇宙是神的一个形像(59节)等等。由此明显看出以下真理：主所创造的一切事物皆为功用，就它们与人有关，并通过人与它们所源于的主有关的秩序、层级和方面而言，它们就是功用。现在有必要详细说一说功用。</p>

327. All of the Lord's creations are useful functions; and they are useful functions in the sequence, on the level, and in the specific way that they relate to humanity and through humanity to the Lord, their source. I have already made the following points on this subject. Nothing can arise from God the Creator that is not useful (<a href="308.htm" target=_top>308</a>). The useful functions of everything created tend upward, step by step, from the lowest to us, and through us to God the Creator, their source (<a href="65.htm" target=_top>65-68</a>). The goal of creation--that everything should return to the Creator and that there should be a union--becomes manifest in outermost forms (<a href="167.htm" target=_top>167-172</a>). They are useful to the extent that they focus on their Creator (<a href="307.htm" target=_top>307</a>). Divinity cannot fail to exist in and be manifested in others that it has created (<a href="47.htm" target=_top>47-51</a>). Everything in the universe is a vessel according to its usefulness, and this depends on its level (<a href="38.htm" target=_top>38</a> [<a href="58.htm" target=_top>58</a>, <a href="66.htm" target=_top>66</a>]). Seen in terms of its functions, the universe is an image of God (<a href="39.htm" target=_top>39</a> [<a href="169.htm" target=_top>169</a>, <a href="298.htm" target=_top>298</a>]). There are many other relevant statements as well. These witness to the truth that all the Lord's creations are useful functions, and that they are useful functions in the sequence, on the level, and in the specific way that they relate to humanity, and through humanity to the Lord, their source. It remains now to say something more detailed about useful functions. </p>

327. All phenomena created by the Lord are forms of use, and they are forms of use in the order, degree and respect that they have relation to mankind and through mankind to the Lord from whom they originate. Regarding these points we have already said the following: That nothing can come into being from God the Creator except what is useful (no. <a href="308.htm">308</a>). That the uses of all things that have been created ascend by degrees from the lowest created forms to mankind, and through mankind to God the Creator from whom they originate (nos. <a href="65.htm">65-68</a>). That the end in creation finds expression in the lasts of it, which is for everything to return to God the Creator and conjunction take place (nos. <a href="167.htm">167-172</a>). That things are useful in the measure that they look to the Creator (no. <a href="307.htm">307</a>). That the Divine cannot but be and have expression in others it creates (nos. <a href="47.htm">47-51</a>). That all constituents of the universe are recipients of the Divine according to the uses they serve, and this in accordance with degrees (no. <a href="58.htm">58</a>). That the universe, regarded from the perspective of its uses, is an image of God (no. <a href="59.htm">59</a>). And much else besides.<p>Apparent from this is the following truth, that all phenomena created by the Lord are forms of use, and that they are forms of use in the order, degree and respect that they have relation to mankind and through mankind to the Lord from whom they originate.<p>It remains for us to say something in particular here about forms of use. </p>

327. ALL THINGS WHICH HAVE BEEN CREATED BY THE LORD ARE USES. THEY ARE USES IN THE ORDER, DEGREE AND RESPECT IN WHICH THEY HAVE RELATION TO MAN, AND THROUGH MAN TO THE LORD FROM WHOM THEY ARE <p>Concerning these subjects it has been stated above: that nothing except use can exist from God the Creator (<a href="308.htm">308</a>); that the uses of all created things ascend by degrees from ultimate things to man, and through man to God the Creator, from Whom they are (<a href="65.htm">65-68</a>); that the end of Creation exists in ultimates, which end is that all things may return to God the Creator, and that there may be conjunction (<a href="167.htm">167-172</a>); that things are uses so far as they have regard to the Creator (<a href="307.htm">307</a>); that the Divine cannot be other than Esse and Existere in others created by itself (<a href="47.htm">47-51</a>); that all things of the universe are recipients according to uses, and this, according to degrees (<a href="58.htm">58</a>); that the universe, viewed from uses, is an image of God (<a href="59.htm">59</a>); besides many other things. From all of which this truth is plain that all things which have been created by the Lord are uses, and that they are uses in that order, degree and respect in which they have relation to man, and through man to the Lord from Whom they are. It remains now that some things should be stated in detail about uses. </p>

327. ALL THINGS CREATED BY THE LORD ARE USE; THEY ARE USES IN THE ORDER, DEGREE, AND RESPECT IN WHICH THEY HAVE RELATION TO MAN, AND THROUGH MAN TO THE LORD, FROM WHOM [THEY ARE]. <p>In respect to this it has been shown above: That from God the Creator nothing can take form except uses (n. <a href="308.htm" target=_top>308</a>); that the uses of all created things ascend by degrees from outmost things to man, and through man to God the Creator, from whom they are (n. <a href="65.htm" target=_top>65-68</a>); that the end of creation takes form in outmosts, which end is, that all things may return to God the Creator, and that there may be conjunction (n. <a href="167.htm" target=_top>167-172</a>); that things are uses so far as they have regard to the Creator (n. <a href="307.htm" target=_top>307</a>); that the Divine must necessarily have being and form in other things created by itself (n. <a href="47.htm" target=_top>47-51</a>); that all things of the universe are recipients according to uses, and this according to degrees (n. <a href="58.htm" target=_top>58</a>); that the universe, viewed from uses, is an image of God (n. <a href="59.htm" target=_top>59</a>); and many other things. From all which this truth is plain, that all things created by the Lord are uses, and that they are uses in that order, degree, and respect in which they have relation to man, and through man to the Lord from whom [they are]. It remains now that some things should be said in detail respecting uses. </p>
