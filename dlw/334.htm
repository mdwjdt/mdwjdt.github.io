<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第334节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>334、这些事物被赐给人来使用和享受，它们都是白白的恩赐，这一点从天上天使的状态很清楚地看出来；和世人一样，他们有身体，有理性官能和属灵品格。他们免费得到滋养，因为他们被赐予日用的食物；他们免费穿衣，因为他们被赐予衣服；他们免费获得住处，因为他们被赐予房子；他们也不关心这一切。此外，他们根据自己理性-属灵的程度而获得享受、保护和状态的维持。不同之处在于，天使看到，这些恩赐皆来自主，因为它们是照其爱和智慧的状态而被造的(如322节所示)；但世人看不到这一点，因为他们的收成一年有一次，并且不是取决于他们的爱和智慧的状态，而是取决于他们所给予的料理。</p>

334. It is abundantly clear that these are for our use and that they are gifts freely given if we look at the state of angels in the heavens. They have bodies, rational abilities, and spiritual receptivity just as we on earth do. They are nourished for free, because they are given their food daily. They are clothed for free, because they are given their clothing. They are housed for free, because they are given their homes. They have no anxiety about any of these things; and to the extent that they are spiritually rational, they enjoy pleasure, protection, and preservation of their state.<p>The difference is that angels see that these things come from the Lord because they are created in response to the angels' state of love and wisdom, as explained above in <a href="322.htm" target=_top>322</a>, while we do not see this because things recur according to the calendar and happen not according to our states of love and wisdom but according to our efforts. </p>

334. These gifts have been given to mankind to use and enjoy, and they are free gifts, as is clearly apparent from the state of angels in heaven, who likewise have a body, rational faculty, and spiritual character, as people do on earth. They are nourished without cost, for they are daily given their food. They are clothed without cost, because they are given their clothing. They have their lodging without cost, because they are given their houses. Nor do they worry about any of these things. <sup>1</sup>
Moreover, to the extent that they are spiritually rational, they experience enjoyment, protection, and the preservation of their condition.<p>The difference is that angels see that these are gifts from the Lord, because things there are created in accordance with the state of their love and wisdom, as we showed in the preceding discussion (no. <a href="322.htm">322</a>), while people do not see this, because things here recur yearly and exist not in accordance with the state of people's love and wisdom, but according to the care they expend on them.<p>

334. That such things have been given to man for use and enjoyment, and that they are free gifts is clearly evident from the state of angels in the heavens who have, like men on earth, a body, a rational and a spiritual. They are nourished freely for food is given them daily, they are clothed freely for garments are given them, they are housed freely for dwellings are given them, nor have they any care regarding all these things, and to the extent that they are rational-spiritual, so they have enjoyment, protection and preservation of state. The difference is that angels see that these things are from the Lord, because they are created according to the state of their love and wisdom (as was shown in a preceding section<a href="322.htm">322</a>). But men do not see this because their harvest is yearly and not in accord with the state of their love and wisdom, but in accord with their diligence. </p>

334. That such things have been given to man to use and enjoy, and that they are free gifts, is clearly evident from the state of angels in the heavens, who have, like men on earth, a body, a rational, and a spiritual. They are nourished freely, for food is given them daily; they are clothed freely, for garments are given them; their dwellings are free, for houses are given them; nor have they any care about all these things; and so far as they are rational-spiritual do they have enjoyment, protection, and preservation of state. The difference is that angels see that these things, - because created according to the state of their love and wisdom, - are from the Lord (as was shown in the preceding chapter, n. <a href="322.htm" target=_top>322</a>); but men do not see this, because their harvest returns yearly, and is not in accord with the state of their love and wisdom, but in accord with the care bestowed by them. </p>

<p>
334. Quod talia data sint homini ad usufruendum, et quod sint dona gratuita, manifeste patet ex statu Angelorum in Coelis, quibus similiter est Corpus, Rationale et Spirituale, sicut est hominibus telluris; illi nutriuntur gratis, nam quotidie illis datur cibus, induuntur gratis quia illis dantur vestes, habitant gratis, quia illis dantur domus, nec ullam omnium illorum curam habent, et quantum rationales spirituales sunt, tantum illis delectatio, tutatio et conservatio status est. Discrimen est quod Angeli videant quod illa a Domino sint, quia secundum statum amoris et sapientiae illorum creantur, ut in antecedente <sup>1</sup>
