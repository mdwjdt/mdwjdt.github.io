<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">1.9神性之爱属于神性智慧，神性智慧属于神性之爱</h4><p>34、神-人里面的神性存在和神性显现是有区别的一体(参看14-16节)。由于神性存在是神性之爱，神性显现是神性智慧，所以这些同样是有区别的一体。之所以说它们是有区别的一体，是因为爱与智慧是两种不同的事物，却又如此结合，以致爱属于智慧，智慧属于爱。因为爱在智慧中存在，智慧在爱中显现。此外，由于智慧从爱中获得其显现(参看15节)，所以神性智慧也是存在。由此可知，爱与智慧合起来时是神性存在，区分开时爱被称为神性存在，智慧被称为神性显现。这就是神性之爱与神性智慧的天使观念。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #34 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
34. Divine love is a property of divine wisdom, and divine wisdom is a property of divine love. On the divine reality and the divine manifestation being distinguishably one in the Divine-Human One, see <a href="14.htm" target=_top>14-16</a> above. Since the divine reality is divine love and the divine manifestation is divine wisdom, these latter are similarly distinguishably one.<p>We refer to them as "distinguishably one" because love and wisdom are two distinguishable things, and yet they are so united that love is a property of wisdom and wisdom a property of love. Love finds its reality in wisdom, and wisdom finds its manifestation in love. Further, since wisdom derives its manifestation from love (as noted in <a href="15.htm" target=_top>15</a> [<a href="14.htm" target=_top>14</a>] above), divine wisdom is reality as well. It follows from this that love and wisdom together are the divine reality, though when they are distinguished we call love the divine reality and wisdom the divine manifestation. This is the quality of the angelic concept of divine love and wisdom. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #34 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
34. Divine love is a property of Divine wisdom, and Divine wisdom is a property of Divine love. The Divine being and Divine expression in the human God are in a distinct combination one (see nos. <a href="14.htm">14-16</a> above); and because the Divine being is Divine love, and the Divine expression is Divine wisdom, therefore these, too, are in a distinct combination one.<p>We say that they are in a distinct combination one because love and wisdom are two distinct attributes, but so united that love is a property of wisdom and wisdom a property of love. For love has its being in wisdom, and wisdom has its expression in love.<p>Moreover, because wisdom takes its expression from love (as said in no. <a href="15.htm">15</a> above), therefore Divine wisdom also is being; and it follows from this that love and wisdom taken together are the Divine being, whereas in considering them in distinction from each other we call love the Divine being, and wisdom the Divine expression.<p>Such is the angelic idea of Divine love and wisdom. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #34 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
34. THE DIVINE LOVE IS OF DIVINE WISDOM, AND THE DIVINE WISDOM IS OF DIVINE LOVE <p>That the Divine Esse and the Divine Existere in God are one distinctly, may be seen above (<a href="14.htm">14-16</a>). And because Divine Esse is Divine Love, and Divine Existere is Divine Wisdom, so these similarly are one distinctly. They are said to be one distinctly because love and wisdom are two distinct things, yet so united that love is of wisdom and wisdom is of love; for in wisdom love IS and in love, wisdom EXISTS. And because wisdom derives its Existere from love (as was said above<a href="15.htm">15</a>), therefore Divine Wisdom also is Esse. From this it follows that Divine Love and Wisdom taken together are the Divine Esse, but taken distinctly, Love is called the Divine Esse, and Wisdom the Divine Existere. Such is the angelic idea of Divine Love and Wisdom. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #34 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
34. DIVINE LOVE IS OF DIVINE WISDOM, AND DIVINE WISDOM IS OF DIVINE LOVE. <p>In God-Man Divine Esse [Being] and Divine Existere [Taking Form] are one distinctly (as may be seen above, n. <a href="14.htm" target=_top>14-16</a>). And because Divine Esse is Divine Love, and Divine Existere is Divine Wisdom, these are likewise one distinctly. They are said to be one distinctly, because love and wisdom are two distinct things, yet so united that love is of wisdom, and wisdom is of love, for in wisdom love is, and in love wisdom Exists; and since wisdom derives its Existere from love (as was said above <a href="15.htm" target=_top>(Divine Love and Wisdom 15)</a>, n. 15), therefore Divine Wisdom also is Esse. From this it follows that love and wisdom taken together are the Divine Esse, but taken distinctly love is called Divine Esse, and wisdom Divine Existere. Such is the angelic idea of Divine Love and of Divine Wisdom. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #34 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
34. QUOD DIVINUS AMOR SIT DIVINAE SAPIENTIAE, ET QUOD DIVINA SAPIENTIA SIT DIVINI AMORIS. Quod Divinum Esse et Divinum Existere in Deo Homine distincte unum sint, videatur supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_34/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_14" target=_top>14-16</a>; et quia Divinum Esse est Divinus Amor, et Divinum Existere est Divina Sapientia, ideo haec similiter distincte unum sunt. Distincte unum dicuntur, quia Amor et Sapientia duo distincta sunt, sed ita unita, ut Amor sit Sapientiae et Sapientia Amoris; Amor enim Est in Sapientia, et Sapientia Existit in Amore: et quia Sapientia trahit suum Existere ex Amore, ut supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_34/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_15" target=_top>15</a> dictum est, inde etiam Divina Sapientia est Esse; ex quo sequitur, quod Amor et Sapientia simul sumta sint Divinum Esse, at distincte sumta vocatur Amor Divinum Esse, et Sapientia Divinum Existere. Talis est idea Angelica de Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia. </p>
