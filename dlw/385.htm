385, 5. This relationship enables us to discover many secrets about our volition and discernment and also about love and wisdom. There is little awareness in this world of the actual nature of volition and love because we cannot love deliberately, and intend from love, the way we can apparently think deliberately. In the same way, we cannot deliberately control the motions of our hearts the way we can control the breathing of our lungs. Given, then, the ignorance in this world of the nature of volition and love and our knowledge of the nature of our heart and lungs (since they are present to the examination of our eyesight and have been examined and described by anatomists, while volition and discernment are not present to the examination of our eyesight), once we know that they correspond and act in unison by means of that correspondence, we can discover many secret things about volition and love that otherwise we could not. We can discover things, for example, about the union of volition with discernment and the reciprocal union of discernment with volition, or about the union of love with wisdom and the reciprocal union of wisdom with love. We can discover how love branches off into feelings, how those feelings are associated with each other, and how they flow into our perceptions and thoughts and ultimately, by means of correspondence, into our physical actions and sensations.<p>These secrets, and many others, can be discovered and explained by examining the way the heart and the lungs are united, how the blood flows from the heart into the lungs and back from the lungs into the heart, and from there through the arteries into all the members, organs, and viscera of the body. </p>

<p>
385. (5) Through that correspondence one can discover many secrets relating to the will and intellect, and so also to love and wisdom. People in the world scarcely know what the will is and what love is, since a person cannot of himself love and from loving will in the manner that he can seemingly of himself understand and think - just as he cannot of himself compel the heart to pump in the manner that he can of himself compel the lungs to breathe.<p>Now because people in the world scarcely know what the love and will are, and yet know what the heart and lungs are - for the latter two are visible to the eyes and can be examined, and by anatomists also have been examined and described, whereas the will and intellect are not visible to the eyes and cannot be examined - therefore when it is known that they correspond and by correspondence operate in union, many secrets can be discovered relating to the will and intellect which could not otherwise be discovered. As for example, secrets relating to the conjunction of the will with the intellect, and to the reciprocal conjunction of the intellect with the will, or secrets relating to the conjunction of love with wisdom, and to the reciprocal conjunction of wisdom with love. Also secrets relating to the ramification of love into affections, to the affiliations of affections, and to the influx of these into perceptions and thoughts, descending finally according to their correspondence into actions and sensations of the body.<p>These and many other secrets can be both discovered and demonstrated from the conjunction of the heart and lungs, and from the influx of blood from the heart into the lungs and the reciprocal influx of it from the lungs into the heart, and its influx from there through the arteries into all the body's members, organs and viscera. </p>

385. (v) By means of this correspondence many arcana concerning the will and understanding, and therefore also concerning love and wisdom may be disclosed. In the world it is scarcely known what the will is or what love is, since man is not able, of himself, to love and from love to will, in the same way that he can understand and think, as from himself; just as he cannot of himself make the heart to beat, although he can of himself make the lungs breathe. Now because it is scarcely known in the world what the will is and what love is, and yet it is known what the heart and lungs are-for these can be seen and examined by the eye, and also have been examined and described by anatomists, whereas the will and understanding cannot be seen and examined-therefore, when it is known that they correspond, and by correspondence act as one, many arcana concerning the will and understanding can be disclosed which otherwise would be impossible; as, for instance, the union of the will with the understanding, and the reciprocal union of the understanding with the will; or, as the conjunction of love with wisdom, and the reciprocal conjunction of wisdom with love; as also the descent of love into the affections, the associations of the affections, and of their influx into the perceptions and thoughts, and at length their influx according to correspondence into the actions and senses of the body. These and many other arcana can be both disclosed and illustrated by the union of the heart and lungs, and by the blood flowing in from the heart to the lungs, and reciprocally from the lungs to the heart, and from there through the arteries into all the members, organs, and viscera of the body. </p>

<p>
385. (5) By means of this correspondence many arcana relating to the will and understanding, thus also to love and wisdom, may be disclosed. In the world it is scarcely known what the will is or what love is, for the reason that man is not able, by himself, to love, and from love to will, although he is able as it were by himself to exercise intelligence and thought; just as he is not able of himself to cause the heart to beat, although he is able of himself to cause the lungs to respire. Now because it is scarcely known in the world what the will is or what love is, but it is known what the heart and the lungs are, - for these are objects of sight and can be examined, and have been examined and described by anatomists, while the will and the understanding are not objects of sight, and cannot be so examined - therefore when it is known that these correspond, and by correspondence act as one, many arcana relating to the will and understanding may be disclosed that could not otherwise be disclosed; those for instance relating to the conjunction of the will with the understanding, and the reciprocal conjunction of the understanding with the will; those relating to the conjunction of love with wisdom, and the reciprocal conjunction of wisdom with love; also those relating to the derivation of love into affections, and to the consociation of affections, to their influx into perceptions and thoughts, and finally their influx according to correspondence into the bodily acts and senses. These and many other arcana may be both disclosed and illustrated by the conjunction of the heart and lungs, and by the influx of the blood from the heart into the lungs, and reciprocally from the lungs into the heart, and therefrom through the arteries into all the members, organs and viscera of the body. </p>

<p>
385. V. Quod per Correspondentiam illam detegi possint multa arcana de voluntate et intellectu, ita quoque de amore et sapientia. In Mundo vix noscitur quid voluntas et quid amor, quoniam homo non potest amare et ex amore velle ex se, <sup>1</sup>
quemadmodum potest <sup>2</sup>
intelligere et cogitare sicut ex se; similiter sicut non potest agere cor ad se movendum a se, quemadmodum potest agere pulmonem ad respirandum a se: nunc quia in Mundo vix noscitur quid voluntas et amor, et tamen noscitur quid cor et pulmo, haec duo enim exstant coram oculis, et lustrari possunt, et quoque ab anatomicis lustrata et descripta sunt, <sup>3</sup>
at voluntas et intellectus non exstant coram oculis, et [non] lustrari possunt, ideo cum scitur quod correspondeant, et per correspondentiam unum agant, possunt plura arcana de voluntate et intellectu detegi, quae alias detegi <sup>4</sup>
non possunt; ut de Conjunctione voluntatis cum intellectu, et de reciproca intellectus cum voluntate; seu de conjunctione amoris cum sapientia et de reciproca sapientiae cum amore: tum de derivatione amoris in affectiones, et de affectionum consociationibus, et de illarum influxu in perceptiones et cogitationes, tandem secundum correspondentiam in actus et in sensus corporis. Haec et plura arcana et detegi et demonstrari possunt ex conjunctione cordis et pulmonis, et ex influxu sanguinis e corde in pulmonem, et reciproca e pulmone in cor, et inde per arterias in omnia corporis membra, organa et viscera. <p>
