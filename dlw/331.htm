<h4 align="center"></h4><p>331、维持身体的功用，涉及身体的营养、衣服、住处、娱乐、享受、保护，以及身体状态的维持。为身体营养所创造的功用是植物界的一切，可用作食物与喝的，如水果，葡萄，谷物或种子，蔬菜和草本；还有动物界可用来吃的一切，如公牛、母牛、牛犊、鹿、绵羊、公山羊、母山羊、羔羊和它们所产的奶；以及多种家禽和鱼。为衣服所创造的功用也是动植物界的众多产物；为住处、娱乐、享受、保护和身体状态的维持所创造的功用也一样。在此不再一一列举，因为它们都是众所周知的，列举它们只会占用篇幅。诚然，也有许多事物对人没有用；但多余的东西并不废去功用，反而确保功用的延续性。对功用的滥用也是有可能的，但滥用也不废去功用，就像对真理的歪曲并不废去真理，除非在那些歪曲它的人身上。</p>

331. Useful functions for the support of our bodies have to do with its nourishment, clothing, shelter, recreation and pleasure, protection, and the preservation of its state. The useful things created for physical nourishment are all the members of the plant kingdom that we eat and drink, such as fruits, grapes, seeds, vegetables, and grains. Then there are all the members of the animal kingdom that we eat, such as steers, cows, calves, deer, sheep, kids, goats, lambs, and the milk they give, as well as many kinds of bird and fish.<p>The useful things created for clothing our bodies also come in abundance from these two kingdoms, as do those for our shelter and for our recreation and pleasure, for our protection, and for the preservation of our state. I will not enumerate these because they are familiar, so listing them would only take up space.<p>There are of course many things that we do not find useful, but these extras do not prevent usefulness. In fact, they enable useful functions to continue. Then there are abuses of functions; but again, the abuse of a function does not eliminate the useful function, just as the falsification of something true does not destroy the truth except for the people who are doing the falsifying. </p>

331. Forms of use for sustaining the body relate to its nourishment, clothing, lodging, recreation and enjoyment, and protection, and the preservation of its condition.<p>Forms of use created for the nourishment of the body are all constituents of the plant kingdom which are serviceable for food and drink, such as fruits, grapes, seeds, vegetables and herbs. So, too, all constituents of the animal kingdom which are eaten, such as steers, cows, calves, deer, sheep, male and female goats, lambs, and the milk obtained from them. And also fowl and fish of many kinds.<p>Forms of use created for the clothing of the body are likewise many of the constituents of these two kingdoms. So, too, forms of use for its lodging; and also for its recreation, enjoyment, and protection, and the preservation of its condition - instances of which we do not enumerate because they are well known, and listing them, therefore, would only serve to fill pages.<p>There are, indeed, many of these forms which do not result in anything useful to mankind, but their superfluousness does not take away their usefulness, but ensures that forms of use continue.<p>Possible also are abuses of forms of use, but the abuse does not take away their usefulness, just as falsifying a truth does not do away with the truth, other than in the people who do it. </p>

331. Uses for sustaining the body have reference to its nourishment, clothing, habitation, recreation and enjoyment, protection and preservation of its state. The uses created for the nourishment of the body are all things of the vegetable kingdom which are for eating and drinking, such as fruits, grapes, grain, vegetables and herbs; also all things of the animal kingdom which are eaten, as oxen, cows, calves, deer, sheep, kids, goats, lambs and milk from them, as well as fowls and fish of many kinds. Uses created for the clothing of the body are also many things from these two kingdoms, as also uses for habitation, recreation, enjoyment, protection and preservation of state. These are not enumerated because they are well known, and therefore a mere recounting of them would fill pages. There are indeed many things which yield nothing of use to man, but what is superfluous does not do away with use, but ensures the continuance of use. Abuse of uses is also possible, but abuse does not do away with use, just as falsification of truth does not do away with truth except with those who falsify it. </p>

331. Uses for sustaining the body relate to its nourishment, its clothing, its habitation, its recreation and enjoyment, its protection and the preservation of its state. The uses created for the nourishment of the body are all things of the vegetable kingdom suitable for food and drink, as fruits, grapes, grain, pulse, and herbs; in the animal kingdom all things which are eaten, as oxen, cows, calves, deer, sheep, kids, goats, lambs, and the milk they yield; also fowls and fish of many kinds. The uses created for the clothing of the body are many other products of these two kingdoms; in like manner, the uses for habitation, also for recreation, enjoyment, protection, and preservation of state. These are not mentioned because they are well known, and their mere enumeration would fill pages. There are many things, to be sure, which are not used by man; but what is superfluous does not do away with the use, but ensures its continuance. Misuse of uses is also possible, but misuse does not do away with use, even as falsification of truth does not do away with truth except with those who falsify it. </p>

331. Usus ad sustentandum Corpus, se referunt ad ejus Nutritionem, Induitionem, Habitationem, Recreationem et Delectationem, Tutationem, et Conservationem status. Usus creati ad corporis Nutritionem, sunt omnia Regni vegetabilis quae esui et potui sunt, ut fructus, uvae, semina, legumina et herbae; tum omnia Regni animalis quae eduntur, ut boves, vaccae, juvenci, cervi, oves, haedi, <sup>1</sup>
caprae, agni, et ex illis lac, tum aves et pisces plurium generum. Usus creati ad corporis Induitionem sunt quoque ex duobus illis Regnis plura: similiter usus ad Habitationem; et quoque ad Recreationem, Delectationem, Tutationem et Conservationem status, quae non enumerantur quia nota sunt, ac ideo recensitio illorum solum impleret paginas. Sunt quidem multa quae non homini in usum cedunt, verum superflua non tollunt usum, sed faciunt ut usus persistant. Datur etiam abusus usuum, sed abusus non tollit usum, sicut falsificatio veri non tollit verum, nisi solum apud illos qui id faciunt. <p>
