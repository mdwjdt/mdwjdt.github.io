<h4 align="center"></h4><p>227、我从天使智慧还得知：受造宇宙的完美就出自其总体和细节，或最大和最小事物在这些层级方面的相似性；因为一物由此视另一物为它的同类，能为了一切功用而与另一物结合，也能将一切目的呈现于结果。</p>

<p>
227. It is also an item of angelic wisdom that the perfection of the created universe comes from a resemblance in regard to levels between inclusive forms and their particular constituents, or between the largest and smallest things. This means that each thing sees the other as a kindred with which it can unite in its whole function and with which it can realize its whole purpose in actual results. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #227 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
227. I have it from angelic wisdom also that the perfection of the created universe arises from the likeness of its general and particular or greatest and least constituents in respect to these degrees; for one thing then looks to another as its like, with which it can be conjoined to provide every useful service and present every end in effect. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #227 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
227. It is also a matter of angelic wisdom that the perfection of the created universe comes from the likeness of generals and particulars, or between greatest and least things as to those degrees. For then one thing regards another as its like, with which it can be conjoined for every use, and can present every end in effect. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #227 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
227. It is likewise a matter of angelic wisdom that from this similitude between generals and particulars, that is, between things greatest and least in respect to these degrees, comes the perfection of the created universe; for thereby one thing regards another as its like, with which it can be conjoined for every use, and can present every end in effect. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #227 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
227. Ex sapientia Angelica etiam est, quod perfectio Universi creati sit ex similitudine communium et particularium, seu maximorum et minimorum, quoad illos gradus, tunc enim spectat unum alterum ut suum simile, cum quo ad omnem usum conjungi potest, ac omnem finem sistere in effectu. </p>
