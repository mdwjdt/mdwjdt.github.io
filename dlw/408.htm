<h4 align="center"></h4><p>408、(10)爱或意愿将智慧或理解力引入它家里的一切事物中。我们所说的爱或意愿的家是指就心智的一切而言的整个人；由于这些对应于身体的一切，如前所示，所以我们所说的家也指就称为肢体、器官和内脏的身体的一切而言的整个人。肺被引入这一切的方式，和理解力被引入心智的一切的方式是一样的，这一点从前面的说明可以看出来，即：爱或意愿为未来的妻子，就是智慧或理解力，预备一个家或洞房(402节)；爱或意愿也在其人类形式，也就是它的家中预备一切，以便它可以与智慧或理解力联合行动(403节)。从上述内容明显可知，整个身体的所有组成部分都通过从肋骨、脊椎、胸骨、横隔膜和悬浮在它们上面的腹膜发出的韧带如此相连，以致它们被肺呼吸牵引并带入类似的交替运动中。<br><br>从解剖学的研究可以看出，肺的交替运动还进入内脏最深处；因为上述韧带附着在包裹内脏的表皮或鞘上，这些表皮或鞘通过延伸甚至进入内脏的最内在部分，动脉和静脉也通过它们的分支进入。由此可见，在身体的每一个组成部分中，肺呼吸都完全与心脏结合。为使结合在方方面面都是完全的，心脏本身甚至也参与肺运动；因为它位于肺腔之中，通过心房(和右心室)与肺腔相连，并停靠在横隔膜上，因此它的动脉也参与了肺运动。此外，胃通过食管和气管的连接而与肺有类似的连接。举这些解剖学实例是为了说明，爱或意愿与智慧或理解力的结合是何性质，合在一起的这二者与心智的一切是如何结合的；属灵的结合和身体的结合是一样的。</p>

408, 10. Love or volition leads wisdom or discernment into every corner of its house. By the "house" of love or volition, I mean the whole person, everything that goes to make up our minds; and since these things correspond to everything in our bodies (as already explained [<a href="374.htm" target=_top>374-377</a>]), the "house" also means the whole [physical] person, everything that goes to make up our bodies, which we refer to as members, organs, and viscera. What has already been presented shows that the lungs are brought into these latter just the way discernment is brought into all the functions of the mind. See, for example, <a href="402.htm" target=_top>402</a>, "Love or volition prepares a home or bridal chamber for its spouse-to-be, wisdom or discernment," and <a href="403.htm" target=_top>403</a>, "Love or volition also prepares everything in its human form or house so that it can act in unison with wisdom or discernment." We can see from what it says there that the whole body and everything in it is connected by extensions from the ribs, the vertebrae, the sternum, the diaphragm, the peritoneum that is suspended from them, and the ligaments--so closely connected that when the lungs are breathing all the organs are impelled and carried along in a similar rhythmic movement.<p>Anatomy shows us that this respiratory rhythm penetrates right into the viscera, even to their deepest recesses, since the ligaments already mentioned are connected to the coverings of the viscera, and the coverings reach into the deepest recesses through their extensions just the way the arteries and veins do through their branches. We may conclude, then, that the lungs' breathing is completely united to the heart in the whole body and in all its parts. To make this union complete in all respects, the heart itself is involved in the respiratory motion. It rests in the lung cavity and is connected to it by its auricles, and it rests on the diaphragm, so that its arteries are also involved in the respiratory movement. Further, the stomach is similarly united because of the connection between its esophagus and the windpipe.<p>I cite these anatomical details to show what the union is like between love or volition and wisdom or discernment, and how the two of them in partnership are united to everything in the mind, since the [spiritual and physical] unions are similar. </p>

<p>408. (10) Love or the will introduces wisdom or the intellect into all the constituents of its home. By the home of love or the will we mean the whole person in respect to all the constituents of his mind; and because these correspond to all the constituents of the body, as we showed above, by the home we mean the whole person also in respect to all the constituents of his body, called members, organs and viscera. The fact that the lungs are introduced into all the latter constituents in the same way that the intellect is into all the constituents of the mind can be seen from what we have shown above, as for instance, that love or the will prepares a home or bridal chamber for its future spouse, which is wisdom or the intellect (no. <a href="402.htm">402</a>), and that love or the will prepares all else in its human form - or in its home - in order to be able to operate conjointly with wisdom or the intellect (no. <a href="403.htm">403</a>).<p>From what we said there it is apparent that through ligaments extending from the ribs, vertebrae, sternum, diaphragm, and peritoneum which is suspended from them, each and all constituents in the entire body are so connected that they are drawn and borne by the breathing of the lungs into similarly alternating movements.<p> </p>
<p>[2] The fact that the alternate motions of the lungs enter also into the very inmost recesses of the viscera can be seen from the study of anatomy; for the aforementioned ligaments are attached to the integuments enveloping the viscera, and these integuments enter through continuations of them even into the inmost elements of the viscera, as do the arteries and veins also through their ramifications. It can be seen from this that the respiration of the lungs enjoys a full conjunction with the heart in each and every constituent of the body. And in order for the conjunction to be complete, the heart is itself caught up in the motion of the lungs; for it lies in the cavity of the lungs, and is connected with them through the atria [and right ventricle], <sup>1</sup>
and it rests on the diaphragm, so that its arteries also partake of the pulmonary motion.<p>Furthermore, the stomach has a similar connection with the lungs through the connection of its esophagus with the trachea.<p>We have cited these anatomical facts in order that the reader may see the nature of the conjunction of love or the will with wisdom or the intellect, and of the two together with all the constituents of the mind. For the conjunction is similar.<p>

1.&nbsp;In the mature heart, blood from the veins enters from the right atrium into the right ventricle, is pumped to the lungs, and returning from there to the left atrium, enters the left ventricle and is pumped through the aorta into the body. In the fetal heart, the venous blood passes from the right atrium through an opening called the foramen ovale into the left atrium and so into the left ventricle, bypassing the right ventricle. </p>

<p>408. (x) Love or the will introduces wisdom or the understanding into all things of its house. By the house of love or the will is meant the whole man as to all his mind's belongings. Because these correspond to all the things of the body (as shown above), the house means also the whole man as to all the parts of his body, called members, organs, and viscera. That the lungs are introduced into all these in the same way as the understanding into all things of the mind can be confirmed from what has been shown above: for example, love or the will prepares a home or bed-chamber for its future wife, which is wisdom or the understanding (<a href="402.htm">402</a>); love or the will prepares all the things in its own human form, or in its home, so that it may act together with wisdom or the understanding (<a href="403.htm">403</a>). From the facts stated in these passages, it is plain that each and all things in the whole body are connected by ligaments put forth from the ribs, spine, sternum, and diaphragm, and from the peritonaeum which depends on these, in such a way that, when the lungs are breathing, they are similarly depressed and raised in alternate movements. That the alternations of breathing also penetrate to the viscera themselves, even to their inmost recesses, can be established from a study of anatomy; for the ligaments mentioned above adhere to the sheaths of the viscera, and the sheaths, by thrusts outward, penetrate to their innermost parts, as do the arteries and veins also through their branches. Hence it can be established that the breathing of the lungs is in entire conjunction with the heart in every part of the body; and in order that the conjunction may be complete in every respect, even the heart itself is in pulmonic motion, for it lies in the bosom of the lungs and is connected with them by the auricles, and rests upon the diaphragm, whereby its arteries also participate in the pulmonic motion. Moreover the stomach has a similar union with the lungs by the connection of its gullet with the trachea. These anatomical facts are adduced with the purpose of showing the kind of conjunction existing between love or the will and wisdom or the understanding, and of both together with all things of the mind; for it is similar. </p>

408. (10) Love or the will introduces wisdom or the understanding into all things of its house. By the house of love or the will is meant the whole man as to all things of his mind; and as these correspond to all things of the body (as shown above), by the house is meant also the whole man as to all things of his body, called members, organs, and viscera. That the lungs are introduced into all these things just as the understanding is introduced into all things of the mind, can be seen from what has been shown above, namely, that love or the will prepares a house or bridal chamber for its future wife, which is wisdom or the understanding (n. <a href="402.htm" target=_top>402</a>); and that love or the will prepares all things in its own human form, that is, in its house, that it may act conjointly with wisdom or the understanding (n. <a href="403.htm" target=_top>403</a>). From what is there said, it is evident that each and all things in the whole body are so connected by ligaments issuing from the ribs, vertebrae, sternum, and diaphragm, and from the peritonaeum which depends on these, that when the lungs respire all are likewise drawn and borne along in alternate movements. Anatomy shows that the alternate waves of respiration even enter into the very viscera to their inmost recesses; for the ligaments above mentioned cleave to the sheaths of the viscera, and these sheaths, by their extensions, penetrate to their innermost parts, as do the arteries and veins also by their ramifications. From this it is evident that the respiration of the lungs is in entire conjunction with the heart in each and every thing of the body; and in order that the conjunction may be complete in every respect, even the heart itself is in pulmonic motion, for it lies in the bosom of the lungs and is connected with them by the auricles, and reclines upon the diaphragm, whereby its arteries also participate in the pulmonic motion. The stomach, too, is in similar conjunction with the lungs, by the coherence of its oesophagus with the trachea. These anatomical facts are adduced to show what kind of a conjunction there is of love or the will with wisdom or the understanding, and how the two in consort are conjoined with all things of the mind; for the spiritual and the bodily conjunction are similar. </p>

<p>408. X. Quod Amor seu Voluntas introducat sapientiam seu intellectum in omnia domus suae. Per domum amoris seu voluntatis intelligitur totus homo quoad omnia quae ejus mentis sunt; quae quia correspondent <sup>1</sup>
omnibus corporis, ut supra ostensum est, <sup>2</sup>
per domum etiam intelligitur totus homo quoad omnia quae ejus corporis sunt, quae vocantur membra, organa et viscera; quod pulmo introducatur in omnia illa, similiter ut intellectus in omnia mentis, constare potest ex illis quae supra ostensa sunt; ut, Quod Amor seu Voluntas praeparet domum seu thalamum pro futura conjuge, quae est sapientia seu intellectus, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_408/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_402" target=_top>402</a>: et, Quod Amor seu Voluntas praeparet omnia in humana sua forma, seu in <sup>3</sup>
sua domo, ut conjunctim cum sapientia seu intellectu possit agere, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_408/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_403" target=_top>403</a>: ex illis, quae ibi dicta sunt, patet, quod omnia et singula in toto corpore per emissa e costis, vertebris, sterno, diaphragmate, peritoneo quod ex illis pendet, ligamenta, ita connexa sint, ut respirante pulmone trahantur et ferantur in actus alternos similiter.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Quod alterna respirationis etiam intrent in ipsa viscera usque ad recessus eorum intimos, ex anatome constare potest, nam ligamenta supra memorata cohaerent involucris viscerum, ac involucra per exsertiones intrant <sup>4</sup>
usque ad intima eorum, sicut etiam faciunt arteriae et venae per ramificationes; inde constare potest, <sup>5</sup>
quod respiratio pulmonis in omni conjunctione sit cum corde in omnibus et singulis corporis: utque conjunctio omnimoda sit, etiam ipsum Cor in Pulmonico motu est, jacet enim in sinu pulmonis, et cohaeret ei per auriculas, et cubat super diaphragmate, ex quo etiam arteriae ejus ex motu pulmonico participant. Praeterea Ventriculus in simili conjunctione est per cohaerentiam ejus Aesophagi cum Trachea. Haec anatomica adducta sunt, ob <sup>6</sup>
finem ut videatur qualis conjunctio est amoris seu voluntatis <sup>7</sup>
cum sapientia seu intellectu, ac utriusque in consortio cum omnibus mentis, nam similis est. <p>
