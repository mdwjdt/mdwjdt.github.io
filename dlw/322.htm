<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第322节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>322、灵界的宇宙类似一个人的形像，这一点可从以下事实明显看出来：刚才(321节)所提到的一切事物都在天使和天使社群周围活生生地出现并形成，仿佛是由他们产生或创造的；它们永远在天使周围，不会消失。它们仿佛是由天使或社群产生或创造的，这从以下事实可推知：当天使离开，或社群转到别的地方时，这些事物就不再出现。此外，当其他天使取代他们时，其周围出现的事物就会改变，如公园里的树木及其果实、花园里的花卉及其种子、田野里的草本和青草，以及各种动物和飞鸟。<br><br>这一切事物以这种方式形成和改变，是因为它们都是照着天使的情感和由此而来的思维形成或存在的。事实上，它们是对应的形式。由于对应之物与它们所对应之物构成一体，所以前者是代表后者的一个形像。当从形式的角度来看待这些事物时，是看不到这种形像的，只有从功用的角度来看待它们时，才能看到它。我得以看到，当天使的眼睛被主打开，天使从功用的对应关系来看待这些事物时，他们就在其中认出并看见他们自己。</p>

322. There is very solid ground for believing that there is a human image to the universe of the other world in the fact that everything listed in <a href="321.htm" target=_top>321</a> is happening concretely around angels and around angelic communities. It is as though these things were being brought forth or created by them. They persist around them without fading away. You can tell that they are apparently brought forth or created by the angels because when an angel goes away or when a community relocates, these things are no longer visible. Then too, when other angels arrive to take their place, the appearance of everything around them changes. The trees and fruits of the parks change, the blossoms and seeds of the flower beds change, the herbs and grasses of the fields change, and so do the kinds of animals and birds.<p>The reason things occur and change like this is that everything occurs in response to the angels' feelings and consequent thoughts. They are responsive entities, and because the things that respond are integral aspects of that to which they respond, they are their visual images.<p>The actual image is not visible when the focus is on the forms of anything, but it is visible when the focus is on their functions. I have been allowed to see that when angels' eyes have been opened by the Lord so that they see these things as they answer to functions, the angels recognize and see themselves in their surroundings. </p>

<p>322. That the universe of the spiritual world resembles in an image the human being can be plainly seen from the fact that all the phenomena just enumerated in no. <a href="321.htm">321</a> vividly appear and take form around an angel and around angelic societies as effects seemingly produced or created by them - effects that remain around them and do not go away. Their being effects seemingly produced or created by them follows from the fact that when an angel leaves, or when a society transfers elsewhere, the phenomena no longer appear. Moreover, when other angels come in their stead, the appearance of all their surroundings changes. Parks change in respect to the trees and fruits they contain. Flower gardens change in respect to the kinds of roses and seeds found in them. Fields change as well in respect to their herbs and grasses, and the species of animals and birds change, too.<p> </p>
<p>[2] These phenomena take form and change as described because they all exist in accordance with the affections and consequent thoughts of the angels. For they are correspondent forms. And because forms that correspond accord with that to which they correspond, therefore they are a representative image of it.<p>This image is not apparent when any of these phenomena are viewed in terms of their forms, but it is seen when they are viewed in terms of their uses.<p>I have been given to see that when angels have their eyes opened by the Lord and view these phenomena from the perspective of their corresponding uses, they recognize and see themselves in them. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #322 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>322. That the universe of that world represents man in an image can be plainly established from the fact that all the things just mentioned (n.32I) appear to the life and have existence about the angel and about the angelic societies, as if produced or created from them. They remain about them and do not pass away. That they are as if produced or created from them is seen by this that, when the angel withdraws, or when the society passes to another place, these things no longer appear. Also when other angels come in place of them, the appearance of all things about them is changed, the trees and fruits of the paradises are changed, in the flower garden the flowers and seeds, in the fields, the herbs and grasses, also the species of animals and birds are changed. Such things have existence and are changed in this way because all these things come into existence according to the affections and consequent thoughts of the angels, for they are correspondences. And because things that correspond make one with that to which they correspond, they are therefore an image representative of it. This image is not seen when these things are regarded in respect of their forms, but it is seen when they are regarded in respect of their uses. It has been granted me to perceive that when their eyes have been opened by the Lord, and they saw those things from the correspondence of uses, the angels recognised and saw themselves in them. </p>

322. That the universe of that world represents man in an image can be clearly seen from this, that all things just mentioned (n. <a href="321.htm" target=_top>321</a>) appear to the life, and take form about the angel, and about the angelic societies, as if they were produced or created by them; they are about them permanently, and do not pass away. That they are as if they were produced or created by them is seen by their no longer appearing when the angel goes away, or when the society passes to another place; also when other angels come in place of these the appearance of all things about them is changed - in the paradises the trees and fruits are changed, in the flower gardens the flowers and seeds, in the fields the herbs and grasses, also the kinds of animals and birds are changed. Such things take form and are changed in this manner, because all these things take form according to the affections and consequent thoughts of the angels, for they are correspondences. And because things that correspond make one with that to which they correspond they are an image representative of it. The image itself is not seen when these things are viewed in their forms, it is seen only when they are viewed in respect to uses. It has been granted me to perceive that angels, when their eyes were opened by the Lord, and they saw these things from the correspondence of uses, recognized and saw themselves therein. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #322 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>322. Quod universum illius Mundi referat in imagine hominem, manifeste constare potest ex eo, quod omnia illa quae nunc <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_322/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_321" target=_top>321</a> memorata sunt, ad vivum appareant et existant circum angelum, et circum societates angelicas, sicut producta aut creata ab illis[;] manent circum illos et non recedunt; quod sint sicut producta aut creata ab illis, constat ex eo, quod cum angelus abit, aut cum societas transit alio, non amplius appareant; tum quando alii Angeli loco illorum veniunt, quod mutetur facies omnium circum illos, mutantur paradisiaca quoad arbores et fructus, mutantur floreta quoad rosas et semina, tum campestria quoad herbas et gramina, et quoque mutantur species animalium et volatilium.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Quod talia existant et quod ita mutentur, est quia omnia illa existunt secundum affectiones et inde cogitationes angelorum, sunt enim correspondentiae, et quia illa quae correspondent, unum faciunt cum illo, cui correspondent, ideo sunt illa imago repraesentativa ejus. Ipsa imago non apparet, quando illa omnia spectantur in formis suis, sed apparet quando illa spectantur in usibus: datum est videre, quod Angeli, quando oculi illorum a Domino aperti sunt, et viderunt illa ex correspondentia usuum, semet in illis agnoverint et viderint. </p>
