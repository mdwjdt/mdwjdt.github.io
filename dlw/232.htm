<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第232节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>232、就天使而言，这三个层级被称为属天、属灵和属世；对他们来说，属天层级就是爱的层级，属灵层级就是智慧的层级，属世层级就是功用的层级。之所以如此称谓这些层级，是因为天堂分为两个国度，一个被称为属天国度，一个被称为属灵国度，再加上世人所在的第三个国度，也就是属世国度。此外，构成属天国度的天使处于爱，构成属灵国度的天使处于智慧，而世人处于功用；这些国度由此被联结在一起。在下一部分我们将说明当如何理解世人处于功用这句话。</p>

<p>
232. For angels, these three levels are called heavenly, spiritual, and earthly; and for them, the heavenly level is the level of love, the spiritual level the level of wisdom, and the earthly level the level of useful functions. The reason for giving the levels these names is that the heavens are divided into two kingdoms, one called the heavenly kingdom and the other the spiritual kingdom, with a third kingdom added where we in the world are, called the earthly one.<p>Then too, the angels who make up the heavenly kingdom are focused on love, while the angels who make up the spiritual kingdom are focused on wisdom and we in this world are focused on useful functions. This is why the kingdoms are united. I will be describing in the next part how to understand the statement that we are focused on useful functions. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #232 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
232. We call these three degrees in the case of angels celestial, spiritual, and natural, and to them the celestial degree is one of love, the spiritual degree one of wisdom, and the natural degree one of useful endeavors.<p>We so name these degrees for the reason that the heavens are distinguished into two kingdoms, one kingdom being called celestial and the other spiritual, to which is attached a third kingdom in which people dwell in the world, which is a natural kingdom.<p>Moreover, the angels of which the celestial kingdom consists are governed by love, and the angels of which the spiritual kingdom consists are governed by wisdom, while people in the world are governed by useful endeavors. So it is, therefore, that these kingdoms are conjoined.<p>How the statement is to be interpreted that people are governed by useful endeavors will be told in Part Four that follows. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #232 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
232. These three degrees with the angels are called Celestial, Spiritual and Natural. And for them the celestial degree is the degree of love, the spiritual degree is the degree of wisdom, and the natural degree is the degree of uses. These degrees are so called because the heavens are distinguished into two kingdoms, one called the celestial and the other the spiritual, to which is added a third kingdom in which are men in the world, and this is the natural kingdom. Also the angels of whom the celestial kingdom consists are in love. The angels of whom the spiritual kingdom consists are in wisdom. But men in the world are in uses. And therefore these kingdoms are conjoined. How it is to be understood that men are in uses will be discussed in the next Part. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #232 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
232. These three degrees with the angels are called Celestial, Spiritual, and Natural; and for them the celestial degree is the degree of love, the spiritual the degree of wisdom, and the natural the degree of uses. These degrees are so called because the heavens are divided into two kingdoms, one called the celestial, the other the spiritual, to which is added a third kingdom wherein are men in the world, and this is the natural kingdom. Moreover, the angels of whom the celestial kingdom consists are in love; the angels, of whom the spiritual kingdom consists are in wisdom; while men in the world are in uses; therefore these kingdoms are conjoined. How it is to be understood that men are in uses will be shown in the next Part. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #232 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
232. Illi tres Gradus apud Angelos nominantur <sup>1</sup>
COELESTIS, SPIRITUALIS, et NATURALIS; ac illis Gradus Coelestis est Gradus amoris, Gradus spiritualis est Gradus sapientiae, et Gradus naturalis est Gradus usuum. Causa quod illi Gradus ita nominentur, est quia Coeli in duo Regna distincti sunt, ac unum Regnum nominatur Coeleste, et alterum Spirituale, quibus accedit tertium Regnum, in quo sunt homines in Mundo, quod est Regnum Naturale. Etiam Angeli, ex quibus Regnum coeleste consistit, in Amore sunt, ac Angeli ex quibus Regnum Spirituale consistit, in sapientia sunt; at homines in Mundo in Usibus sunt: ac ideo illa Regna conjuncta sunt. Quomodo intelligendum est, quod homines in usibus sint, <sup>2</sup>
in Parte sequente dicetur. <p>
