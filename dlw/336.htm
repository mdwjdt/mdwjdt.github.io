<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">4.10 恶用不是主创造的，而是与地狱一起产生的</h4><p>336、实际表达出来的一切良善都被称为功用，实际表达出来的一切邪恶也都被称为功用；但后者被称为恶用，而前者被称为善用。由于一切良善的事物皆来自主，一切邪恶的事物皆来自地狱，故可知，主只创造了善用，恶用是由地狱产生的。本章特别论述的功用是指地上可见的一切事物，如各种动植物。对人有用的动植物来自主，对人有害的则来自地狱。来自主的功用同样是指完善一个人的理性官能，使他能从主获得一种属灵品格的一切。相反，恶用是指摧毁理性官能，使人不能变得属灵的一切。对人有害的这些事物被称为功用，是因为它们有助于恶人行恶，还有助于吸收恶性，从而充当治疗的手段。我们在两种意义上使用“功用”一词，就像“爱”这个词一样，它既论及善爱，也论及恶爱；此外，爱称它所做的一切为功用。</p>

336. Evil functions were not created by the Lord. Rather, they came into being along with hell. All good things that find expression in act are called functions, and all evil things that find expression in act are also called functions. The latter, though, are called evil functions, while the former are called good functions. Since everything good is from the Lord and everything evil from hell, it follows that only good functions have been created by the Lord, and that all the evil ones have come from hell.<p>The particular functions I am talking about in this section are all the things we see on earth, like all kinds of animal and all kinds of plant. In both instances, the ones that are good for us are from the Lord and the ones that do us harm are from hell. By the same token, "useful functions from the Lord" means all the things that help develop our rational ability and that enable us to be receptive of spiritual gifts from the Lord; while "evil functions" means everything that destroys our rational ability and makes it impossible for us to become spiritual.<p>The reason harmful things are called "useful functions" is that they are useful to evil people for their evildoing, and also because they serve to soak up malice and therefore lead to remedies. I use "useful functions" in this dual sense, and do the same with "love," speaking of "a good love" and "an evil love." Whatever love brings forth it calls useful. </p>

336. Evil forms of use were not created by the Lord, but arose together with hell. We call all good endeavors having actual expression forms of use, and we also call all evil endeavors having actual expression forms of use; but the latter we call evil forms of use, and the first, good forms of use.<p>Now because all good endeavors come from the Lord, and all evil endeavors from hell, it follows that the Lord created only good forms of use, and that evil forms of use arose from hell.<p>By the forms of use that we are considering specifically in the present discussion we mean all forms that appear on the earth, such as animals of every kind and plants of every kind. All of these that are useful to mankind come from the Lord, and those which are harmful to mankind come from hell.<p>By forms of use from the Lord we mean likewise all matters that perfect a person's rational faculty, and which enable the person to receive a spiritual character from the Lord. Conversely, by evil forms of use we mean all matters that destroy the rational faculty, and which render a person incapable of becoming spiritual.<p>We call things that are harmful to mankind forms of use because they are of use to evil people in doing evil, and for the reason also that they are helpful for absorbing malignancies, and so also as remedies.<p>We use the term "use" in both senses, like the term "love," as referring to a good love or an evil love; and love calls everything that it does useful. </p>

336. EVIL USES WERE NOT CREATED BY THE LORD, BUT ORIGINATED TOGETHER WITH HELL <p>All good things which exist in act are called uses, and all evil things which exist in act are also called uses, but the latter are evil uses while the former are good uses. Now since all good things are from the Lord and all evil things from hell, it follows that none but good uses were created by the Lord and that evil uses arose out of hell. By the uses especially treated of in this section are understood all those which are to be seen on the earth, such as animals and plants of every kind. The animals and plants which perform uses to man are from the Lord, and those which do injury to man are from hell. By uses from the Lord are likewise understood all things which perfect the rational of man, so that he may receive the spiritual from the Lord. And by evil uses are understood all things which destroy the rational, making man unable to become spiritual. These things which do injury to man are called uses because they are of use to the evil in doing evil, and are also conducive to absorbing malignities, and thus to curing them. Use is spoken of in both senses, as is love, so there is good love and evil love, and love calls everything that it does, use. </p>

336. EVIL USES WERE NOT CREATED BY THE LORD, BUT ORIGINATED TOGETHER WITH HELL. <p>All good things that take form in act are called uses; and all evil things that take form in act are also called uses, but evil uses, while the former are called good uses. Now, since all good things are from the Lord and all evil things from hell, it follows that none but good uses were created by the Lord, and that evil uses arose out of hell. By the uses specially treated of in this chapter are meant all those things which are to be seen upon the earth, as animals of every kind and plants of every kind. Such things of both kingdoms as are useful to man are from the Lord, but those which are harmful to man are from hell. By uses from the Lord are likewise meant all things that perfect the rational of man, and cause him to receive the spiritual from the Lord; but by evil uses are meant all things that destroy the rational, and make man unable to become spiritual. Those things that are harmful to man are called uses because they are of use to the evil in doing evil, and also are serviceable in absorbing malignities and thus also as remedies. "Use" is employed in both senses, as love is when we speak of good love and evil love; moreover, everything that love does it calls use. </p>

336. QUOD MALI USUS A DOMINO NON CREATI SINT, SED QUOD UNA CUM INFERNO ORTI. Omnia bona quae actu existunt, vocantur Usus, et omnia mala quae actu existunt, etiam vocantur usus, sed hi vocantur usus mali, illi autem usus boni. Nunc quia omnia bona sunt ex Domino, et omnia mala ex Inferno, sequitur quod non alii usus quam boni a Domino creati sint, et quod usus mali ex Inferno orti sint. Per usus, de quibus in hoc Articulo in specie agitur, intelliguntur omnia quae super tellure apparent, sicut animalia omnis generis, et vegetabilia omnis generis; haec et illa quae usum praestant homini, sunt a Domino, et quae damnum inferunt homini sunt ex Inferno. Similiter per usus a Domino intelliguntur omnia quae perficiunt Rationale hominis, et quae faciunt ut homo recipiat Spirituale a Domino; at per usus malos intelliguntur omnia quae destruunt Rationale, et faciunt ut homo non fieri Spiritualis possit. Quod illa quae damnum inferunt homini, dicantur usus, est quia malis usui sunt ad malefaciendum, et quod etiam conducant ad malignitates absorbendas, ita quoque ad medelas: dicitur usus in utroque sensu, sicut amor, ut amor bonus et amor malus, et amor vocat usum omne id quod ab illo fit. </p>
