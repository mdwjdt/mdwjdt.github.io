<h4 align="center"></h4><p>245、现说明光流入人里面属心智的生命三个层级的性质。人里面的形式是热和光或爱和智慧的容器，存在于三重秩序，或三个层级中，如前所述；它们生来是透明的，传递属灵之光如同明透的玻璃传递属世之光。正因如此，人在智慧上甚至能被提升至第三层级。然而，这些形式仍没有被打开，除非并直到属灵之热与属灵之光结合，也就是爱与智慧结合。这些透明的形式通过这种结合照着层级被打开。自然界太阳的光和热作用于地上植被的情形也一样。冬天的光和夏天的光一样明亮，却打不开种子或树里面的任何东西，但当春天的热与那光结合时，这热就会打开它们。之所以存在这种相似性，是因为属灵之光对应于属世之光，属灵之热对应于属世之热。</p>

245. Now I need to describe how light flows into the three levels that make up the human mind. From our birth, the forms that are receptive of warmth and light or love and wisdom (which as already noted [<a href="223.htm" target=_top>223</a>] are in a threefold pattern or on three levels) are translucent and let spiritual light pass through, the way clear glass lets physical light through. This is why we can be raised up all the way to the third level in respect to our wisdom. These forms are not opened, though, until spiritual warmth, or the love of wisdom, is united to the spiritual light. It is through this union that the translucent forms are opened level by level.<p>This is like the light and warmth of the world's sun and plant life on earth. The winter light is just as bright as summer light, but it does not open anything in seeds or trees. However, when the warmth of spring is united to that light then things open. The resemblance stems from the fact that spiritual light is analogous to physical light and spiritual warmth is analogous to physical warmth. </p>

245. We will now explain the nature of the influx of light into the three degrees of life in a person, degrees which are those of the mind.<p>The forms in a person which are receptacles of warmth and light or of love and wisdom, and which, as said, exist in a threefold order or in three degrees, are from birth transparent, transmitting spiritual light as clear glass does natural light. It is because of this that a person can be elevated even into the third degree in respect to wisdom.<p>Nevertheless, these forms still are not opened unless and until spiritual warmth is added to spiritual light or love to wisdom. By their union these transparent forms are opened, one degree after another.<p>The case is the same as with the light and warmth of the world's sun in respect to vegetation on earth. The light in winter, which is just as bright as the light in summer, does not open anything in a seed or a tree, but when the warmth of spring is added to the light, then it does. The case is the same because spiritual light corresponds to natural light, and spiritual warmth corresponds to natural warmth. </p>

245. It will now be explained what is the nature of the influx of light into the three degrees of life in man which belong to his mind. The forms which are receptacles of heat and light, that is, of love and wisdom in man, and which, as was said, are in threefold order, or of three degrees, are transparent from birth, and transmit spiritual light just as crystal glass transmits natural light. Hence it is that man as to his wisdom can be raised even to the third degree. But yet these forms are not opened, except when spiritual heat conjoins itself to spiritual light, that is, love to wisdom. By this conjunction these transparent forms are opened according to degrees. It is the same with the heat and light of the sun of the world in respect to the plants upon the earth. The light of winter which is as bright as that of summer does not open anything in seed or in tree. But when spring heat conjoins itself to the light, then it opens [vegetation]. The case is similar, for spiritual light corresponds to natural light, and spiritual heat to natural heat. </p>

245. The nature of the influx of light into the three degrees of life in man which belong to his mind, shall now be shown. The forms which are receptacles of heat and light, that is, of love and wisdom in man, and which (as was said) are in threefold order or of three degrees, are transparent from birth, transmitting spiritual light as crystal glass transmits natural light; consequently in respect to wisdom man can be raised even into the third degree. Nevertheless these forms are not opened except when spiritual heat conjoins itself to spiritual light, that is, love to wisdom; by such conjunction these transparent forms are opened according to degrees. It is the same with light and heat from the sun of the world in their action on plants on the earth. The light of winter, which is as bright as that of summer, opens nothing in seed or in tree, but when vernal heat conjoins itself to that light then the heat opens them. There is this similarity because spiritual light corresponds to natural light, and spiritual heat to natural heat. </p>

245. Nunc dicetur qualis est influxus lucis in tres gradus vitae, quae Mentis sunt, apud hominem: formae, quae sunt receptacula caloris et lucis, seu amoris et sapientiae apud illum, et quae, ut dictum est, in triplici ordine, seu trium graduum[,] sunt, a nativitate sunt diaphanae, ac lucem spiritualem transmittunt, sicut vitrum Chrystallinum lucem naturalem; inde est quod homo quoad sapientiam usque in tertium gradum possit elevari. At usque formae illae non aperiuntur, nisi dum calor spiritualis se conjungit luci spirituali, seu amor sapientiae[;] per hanc conjunctionem formae illae diaphanae secundum Gradus aperiuntur. Hoc simile est cum luce et calore Solis Mundi quoad vegetabilia super tellure; lux hyemalis, quae aeque candida est cum luce aestiva, non aperit aliquid in semine aut in arbore, sed cum calor vernalis se conjungit luci, tunc aperit: similis res est, nam Lux spiritualis correspondet luci naturali, et calor spiritualis correspondet calori naturali. </p>
