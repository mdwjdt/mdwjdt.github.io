<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">2.4 属灵的热与光在从显为太阳的主发出时构成一体，正如祂的神性之爱与神性智慧构成一体</h4><p>99、第一部分解释了主里面的神性之爱与神性智慧如何构成一体。热与光以同样的方式构成一体，因为它们从这二者发出，因其对应关系而构成一体；热对应于爱，光对应于智慧。由此可推知，由于神性之爱是神性存在，神性智慧是神性显现(如前所示，14-16节)，所以属灵之热是神性存在的神性发出，属灵之光是神性显现的神性发出。此外，由于这种合一，神性之爱属于神性智慧，神性智慧属于神性之爱(如前所示，34-39节)，所以属灵之热属于属灵之光，属灵之光属于属灵之热。从这种合一可推知，热与光从显为太阳的主发出时为一。不过，下文我们会看到，它们没有作为一被天使和世人接受。</p>

99. The spiritual warmth and light that result from the emanation from the Lord as the sun form a single whole just as his divine love and wisdom do. Part 1 explains how divine love and wisdom form a single whole in the Lord. Warmth and light form a similar whole because they are emanations, and emanations constitute a whole by reason of their correspondence. The warmth answers to love, and the light to wisdom.<p>It therefore follows that since divine love is the divine reality and divine wisdom is the divine manifestation (see <a href="14.htm" target=_top>14-16</a> above), spiritual warmth is divinity emanating from the divine reality and spiritual light is divinity emanating from the divine manifestation. This means that just as divine love is a property of divine wisdom and divine wisdom is a property of divine love because of this union (see <a href="34.htm" target=_top>34-39</a> above), spiritual warmth is a property of spiritual light and spiritual light is a property of spiritual warmth. As a result of this kind of oneness, it follows that warmth and light are a single whole as they emanate from the Lord as the sun.<p>We will see later, though [<a href="125.htm" target=_top>125</a>], that they are not accepted as a single whole by angels or by us. </p>

99. Spiritual heat and light as they emanate from the Lord as the sun are united, as His Divine love and wisdom are united. How Divine love and wisdom are united in the Lord was explained in Part One. <sup>1</sup>
Heat and light are united in the same way, because they are what emanate, and any attributes that emanate are by correspondence united. For heat corresponds to love, and light to wisdom.<p>It follows from this that as Divine love is the Divine being, and Divine wisdom its Divine expression (as shown above in nos. <a href="14.htm">14-16</a>), so spiritual heat is the Divine attribute emanating from the Divine being, and spiritual light the Divine attribute emanating from the Divine expression. Consequently, as by virtue of that union Divine love is a property of Divine wisdom, and Divine wisdom a property of Divine love (as shown above in nos. <a href="34.htm">34-39</a>), so spiritual heat is a property of spiritual light, and spiritual light a property of spiritual heat. Moreover, because of that union, it follows that heat and light as they emanate from the Lord as the sun are one.<p>That they are nevertheless not received as one by angels and people will be seen in subsequent discussions. <sup>2</sup>

99. SPIRITUAL HEAT AND LIGHT, BY GOING FORTH FROM THE LORD AS A SUN, MAKE ONE JUST AS HIS DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM MAKE ONE <p>It has been told in Part I how the Divine Love and Wisdom in the Lord make one. Similarly, heat and light make one because they proceed [from these], and because they proceed, they make one by correspondence. For heat corresponds to love, and light to wisdom. From this it follows that as Divine Love is Divine Esse, and Divine Wisdom is Divine Existere (as shown above<a href="14.htm">14-16</a>), thus spiritual heat is the Divine proceeding from the Divine Esse, and spiritual light is the Divine proceeding from the Divine Existere. Therefore, as by that union Divine Love is of Divine Wisdom, and Divine Wisdom is of Divine Love (as stated above<a href="34.htm">34-39</a>), so spiritual heat is of spiritual light, and spiritual light is of spiritual heat. And because there is such a union, it follows that heat and light, in proceeding from the Lord as a Sun, are one. It will be seen, however, in what follows that they are not received as one by angels and men. </p>

99. SPIRITUAL HEAT AND LIGHT IN PROCEEDING FROM THE LORD AS A SUN, MAKE ONE, JUST AS HIS DIVINE LOVE AND DIVINE WISDOM MAKE ONE. <p>How Divine Love and Divine Wisdom in the Lord make one has been explained in Part I.; in like manner heat and light make one, because they proceed from these, and the things which proceed make one by virtue of their correspondence, heat, corresponding to love, and light to wisdom. From this it follows that as Divine Love is Divine Esse [Being] and Divine Wisdom is Divine Existere [Taking form] (as shown above <a href="14.htm" target=_top>(Divine Love and Wisdom 14-16)</a>, n. 14-16), so spiritual heat is thy Divine proceeding from Divine Esse, and spiritual light is the Divine proceeding from Divine Existere. And as by that union Divine Love is of Divine Wisdom, and Divine Wisdom is of Divine Love (as shown above, n. 35 <a href="34.htm" target=_top>34-39</a>), so spiritual heat is of spiritual light, and spiritual light is of spiritual heat And because there is such a union it follows that heat and light, in proceeding from the Lord as a sun, are one. It will be seen, however, in what follows, that they are not received as one by angels and men. </p>

<p>
99. QUOD SPIRITUALIS CALOR ET LUX A PROCEDENDO A DOMINO UT SOLE UNUM FACIANT, SICUT IPSIUS DIVINUS AMOR ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA UNUM FACIUNT. Quomodo Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia in Domino unum faciunt, in Parte Prima dictum est; similiter unum faciunt Calor et Lux, quia haec procedunt, et quae procedunt, unum faciunt per correspondentiam; calor enim correspondet Amori, et lux Sapientiae. Inde sequitur, quod sicut Divinus Amor est Divinum Esse, et Divina Sapientia est Divinum Existere, ut supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_99/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_14" target=_top>14-16</a>, ita Spiritualis Calor est Divinum procedens ex Divino Esse, et Spiritualis Lux est Divinum procedens ex Divino Existere; quare sicut per unionem illam Divinus Amor est Divinae Sapientiae et Divina Sapientia est Divini Amoris, ut supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_99/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_34" target=_top>34-39</a>, ita Spiritualis calor est Spiritualis lucis, et Spiritualis lux est Spiritualis caloris; et quia talis unio est, sequitur quod Calor et Lux in procedendo a Domino ut Sole unum sint. Quod autem non ut unum recipiantur ab Angelis et ab hominibus, videbitur in sequentibus. </p>
