<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">1.19 神性在最大和最小事物上是一样的</h4><p>77、这一点紧随前两点而来，即：神性在一切空间之中，却无关空间；神性在一切时间之中，却无关时间。此外，空间有相对较大的、超大的，相对较小的、超小的。由于如前所述，空间与时间是一致的，故时间具有同样的性质。神性在这些方面是一样的，因为神性不像属自然界的一切事物那样变化多端，而是恒定不变。因此，神性时时、处处都是一样的。</p>

<p>
77. Divinity is the same in the largest and smallest things. This follows from the two preceding sections, from Divinity being nonspatially present in all space and nontemporally present in all time. There are larger and larger and smaller and smaller spaces; and since as already noted [<a href="74.htm" target=_top>74</a>] space and time are indistinguishable, the same holds true for segments of time. The reason Divinity is the same in all of them is that Divinity is not changeable or inconsistent like everything that involves space and time, or nature. It is constant and unchanging, so it is everywhere and always the same. </p>
 

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #77 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
77. The Divine in the greatest and least of things is the same. This follows from the two preceding discussions showing that the Divine is present through all space independently of space and through all time independently of time; for intervals of space may be relatively great and immense, and they may be relatively small and minute. Moreover, because intervals of space and intervals of time accord, as said above, the case is the same with intervals of time.<p>The Divine is the same throughout these for the reason that the Divine is not variable and mutable as everything connected with space and time is, or as everything connected with nature is, but is invariable and immutable. Consequently it is everywhere and always the same. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #77 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
77. THE DIVINE IS THE SAME IN GREATEST AND LEAST THINGS <p>This follows from the two preceding sections that the Divine is in all space apart from space, and in all time apart from time. And spaces are greater and greatest, and lesser and least. And because, as stated above, spaces and times make one, it is the same with time. The Divine is the same in these because the Divine is not varying and changeable, as is everything else of space and time, that is, everything which belongs to Nature, but is unvarying and unchangeable. Consequently it is everywhere and always the same. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #77 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
77. THE DIVINE IN THINGS GREATEST AND LEAST IS THE SAME. <p>This follows from the two preceding articles, that the Divine apart from space is in all space, and apart from time is in all time. Moreover, there are spaces greater and greatest, and lesser and least; and since spaces and times, as said above, make one, it is the same with times. In these the Divine is the same, because the Divine is not varying and changeable, as everything is which belongs to nature, but is unvarying and unchangeable, consequently the same everywhere and always. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #77 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
77. QUOD DIVINUM IN MAXIMIS ET MINIMIS SIT IDEM. Hoc sequitur ex duobus Articulis qui praecedunt, quod Divinum sit in omni spatio absque spatio, et in omni tempore absque tempore, namff1 spatia sunt majora et maxima, et sunt minora et minima: et quia spatia et tempora unum faciunt, ut supra dictum est, simile est cum temporibus. Quod Divinum in illis sit idem, est quia Divinum non est varium et mutabile, sicut est omne quod est spatii et temporis, seu omne quod est naturae, sed est invariabile et immutabile; inde est ubivis et semper idem. </p>
