<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第181节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>181、由于爱与智慧有层级之分，所以热与光也有层级之分。我们所说的热与光是指属灵之热与光，就是天使在天堂所拥有的那种，以及就其心智内层而言世人所拥有的那种。因为世人拥有和天使一样的爱之热和智慧之光。在天堂，情况是这样：天使所拥有的爱之性质和量决定了他们所体验的热之性质和量。他们的光同样取决于他们的智慧。原因在于，他们里面的爱在热里面，智慧在光里面，如前所示。世人也一样，不同之处在于：天使能感受到那热，也能看见那光，而世人却不能，因为世人活在属世的热与光中。只要活在属世的热与光中，他们就感受不到属灵之热，除非通过某种爱的享受，也看不见属灵之光，除非通过对真理的觉知。由于只要活在属世的热与光中，人根本就意识不到他里面的属灵之热与光，还由于这方面的知识只能通过灵界经历得知，所以我们在此必须详细说说天使及其天堂所拥有的热与光。关于该主题的启示只能从此处，而不能从别处获得。</p>

181. Since there are levels of love and wisdom, there are levels of warmth and light--warmth and light here meaning spiritual warmth and light as angels experience them in the heavens and as they exist for us in the deeper levels of our minds. This is because we do have a warmth of love and a light of wisdom like that of angels.<p>It is like this in the heavens. The quality and amount of angels' love determines the quality and amount of their warmth, with the same relationship between their wisdom and their light. This is because there is love in their warmth and wisdom in their light, as I have already described [<a href="5.htm" target=_top>5</a>, <a href="32.htm" target=_top>32</a>, <a href="84.htm" target=_top>84</a>]. The same holds true for us on earth, but with the difference that angels feel the warmth and see the light, while we do not, the reason being that we are focused on physical warmth and light; and as long as we are, we feel spiritual warmth only as a kind of pleasure of love and see spiritual light only as a kind of sense of what is true.<p>Since people know nothing about the spiritual warmth and light within them as long as they are focused on physical warmth and light, and since they can know about this only through experience offered by the spiritual world, I need first of all to talk about the warmth and light that surround angels and their heavens. This is the one and only way to shed some light on this matter. </p>

181. Since there are degrees of love and wisdom, there are also degrees of heat and light. By heat and light we mean spiritual heat and light, the kind of heat and light angels have in the heavens, and the kind people possess inwardly in the interior regions of their minds. For people possess the same warmth of love and the same light of wisdom as angels.<p>In the heavens the case is as follows. The nature and measure of the love angels possess determines the nature and measure of the warmth they experience. Their light is likewise determined by their wisdom. The reason is that love exists in them in a state of warmth, and wisdom in a state of light, as we have shown before.<p>It is the same on earth with people, but with the difference that angels feel that warmth and see that light, whereas people do not. The reason is that people are living in a world of natural warmth and light, and as long as they are they do not feel spiritual warmth except as the result of some delighting of their love, and do not see spiritual light except as the result of a perception of truth.<p>Now because as long as a person is living in a world of natural warmth and light he is not at all aware of the spiritual warmth and light in him, and nothing of these can be known except through experience gained from the spiritual world, therefore we must say something here in particular about the warmth and light possessed by angels and their heavens. From there and nowhere else is enlightenment on this subject possible. </p>

181. Since there are degrees of love and wisdom, so there are degrees of heat and light. By heat and light are understood spiritual heat and light such as angels in the heavens have, and such as men have as to the interior things of their minds; for men have a heat of love and a light of wisdom similar to what the angels have. Thus it is in the heavens that such as is the nature and extent of the love which angels have, so is the nature and extent of their heat. The same is the case regarding light as to their wisdom. The reason is that with them love is in heat, and wisdom in light, as has been shown before. It is the same on earth with men with the difference, however, that angels feel that heat and see that light but men do not. This is because men are in natural heat and light, and so long as this is so, they do not feel spiritual heat except through a certain delight of love, and they do not see spiritual light except through a perception of truth. Now because man, while he is in natural heat and light, knows nothing of the spiritual heat and light with him, and as this cannot be known except through experience from the spiritual world, therefore the heat and light in which the angels and their heavens are will be specially spoken of here. From this and from no other source can there be enlightenment on this subject. </p>

181. Since there are degrees of love and wisdom, there are also degrees of heat and light. By heat and light are meant spiritual heat and light, such as angels in the heavens have, and such as men have as to the interiors of their minds; for men have a heat of love similar to that of the angels, and a similar light of wisdom. In the heavens, such and so much love as the angels have, such and so much is their heat; and the same is true of their light as compared with their wisdom; the reason is, that with them love is in the heat, and wisdom in the light (as was shown above). It is the same with men on earth, with the difference, however, that angels feel that heat and see that light, but men do not, because they are in natural heat and light; and while they are in the natural heat and light spiritual heat is not felt except by a certain enjoyment of love, and spiritual light is not seen except by a perception of truth. Now since man, so long as he is in natural heat and light, knows nothing of the spiritual heat and light within him, and since knowledge of these can be obtained only through experience from the spiritual world, the heat and light in which the angels and their heavens are, shall here be especially spoken of. From this and from no other source can enlightenment on this subject be had. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #181 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
181. Quoniam Gradus amoris et sapientiae sunt, etiam gradus caloris et lucis sunt: per calorem et lucem intelliguntur calor et lux spirituales, quales sunt Angelis in Coelis, et quales sunt hominibus quoad interiora quae sunt Mentis eorum, nam hominibus similis calor amoris est, et similis lux sapientiae est, quae sunt Angelis. In Coelis ita est; qualis et quantus est Angelis amor, talis et tantus est illis calor; similiter lux quoad sapientiam; causa est, quia amor in calore est, et sapientia in luce, apud illos, ut prius ostensum est: simile est in terris apud homines, cum differentia tamen, quod Angeli sentiant calorem illum, ac videant lucem illam, non autem homines; ex causa quia homines in calore et luce naturali sunt, et tamdiu non sentiunt calorem spiritualem, nisi quam per quoddam amoris jucundum, ac vident lucem spiritualem nisi quam per perceptionem veri. Nunc quia homo, dum in naturali calore et luce est, nihil scit de calore et luce spirituali apud se, et hoc non sciri potest quam per experientiam e Mundo spirituali, ideo de calore et de luce, in quibus sunt Angeli ac Coeli illorum, hic imprimis dicetur; inde et non aliunde datur in hac re illustratio. </p>
