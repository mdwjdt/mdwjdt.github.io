<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第142节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>142、由于这两种爱，即对主之爱和源于自我之爱的统治之爱彼此完全对立，凡处于对主之爱的人都转向显为太阳的主(如前一个标题所示)，故可以看出，凡陷入源于自我之爱的统治之爱的人都背对主。于是，他们面向相反的方向，因为那些处于对主之爱的人只喜欢被主引导，愿意唯独主掌权；而那些陷入源于自我之爱的统治之爱的人只喜欢被自己引导，愿意唯独自己掌权。之所以称其为源于自我之爱的统治之爱，是因为还有一种源于履行服务之爱的统治之爱，这种爱是一种属灵之爱；事实上，它与对邻之爱构成一体。然而，这种爱不能被称为统治之爱，而应被称为履行服务之爱。</p>

<p>
142. Since these two loves--love for the Lord and love of controlling prompted by self-love--are absolute opposites, and since everyone who is caught up in love for the Lord turns toward the Lord as the sun, as explained in the preceding section, it stands to reason that everyone who is caught up in a love of controlling prompted by self-love turns away from the Lord. The reason people turn in opposite directions is that those who are caught up in love for the Lord love being led by the Lord more than anything else, and want the Lord alone to be in control. In contrast, if people are caught up in a love of controlling prompted by self-love, there is nothing they love more than leading themselves. They want to be the only ones who are in control.<p>The reason we refer to "a love of controlling prompted by self-love" is that there is a love of controlling out of a love of service. Since this love acts in unison with love for our neighbor, it is a spiritual love. In fact, it cannot truly be called a love of being in control: it should be called a love of service. </p>

142. Since these two loves - love toward the Lord and a love of ruling stemming from a love of self - are altogether opposed to each other, and because people who are prompted by love toward the Lord all turn to the Lord as the sun (as reported under the previous heading), it can be seen that people who are prompted by a love of ruling stemming from a love of self all turn their back to the Lord.<p>They turn thus in opposite directions for the reason that people who are prompted by love toward the Lord love nothing more than to be led by the Lord, and they want the Lord alone to rule, whereas people who are prompted by a love of ruling stemming from a love of self love nothing more than to lead themselves, and they want only themselves to rule.<p>We say a love of ruling stemming from a love of self, because a love of ruling is possible that stems from a love of performing useful services, a love which, because it goes hand in hand with love for the neighbor, is a spiritual love. But this love cannot be called a love of ruling, but a love of performing useful services. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #142 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
142. Since these two loves, love to the Lord and the love of domineering from self-love are entirely opposed to each other, and because all who are in love to the Lord turn towards the Lord as a Sun, as was shown in a previous section, it can be established that all who are in the love of domineering from self-love turn backward from the Lord. Therefore they turn in an opposite direction, because those who are in love to the Lord love nothing more than to be led by the Lord, and will that the Lord alone should rule, whereas those who are in the love of domineering from self-love, love nothing more than to be led by themselves, and will that they alone may rule. It is said the love of domineering from self-love, because there is a love of ruling from a love of performing uses, and this love, since it makes one with love towards the neighbour, is a spiritual love. Yet this love cannot be called a love of domineering but a love of performing uses. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #142 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
142. Since these two loves, love to the Lord and love of rule springing from love of self, are wholly opposed to each other, and since all who are in love to the Lord turn to the Lord as a sun (as was shown in the preceding article), it can be seen that all who are in the love of rule springing from love of self, turn their backs to the Lord. They thus face in opposite directions, because those who are in love to the Lord love nothing more than to be led by the Lord, and will that the Lord alone shall rule; while those who are in the love of rule springing from love of self, love nothing more than to be led by themselves, and will that themselves alone may rule. This is called a love of rule springing from love of self, because there is a love of rule springing from a love of performing uses, which is a spiritual love, because it makes one with love towards the neighbor. Still this cannot be called a love of rule, but a love of performing duties. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #142 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
142. Quoniam bini illi Amores, Amor in Dominum, et Amor dominandi ex amore sui, sunt sibi prorsus oppositi; et quia omnes qui in Amore in Dominum sunt, se vertunt ad Dominum ut Solem, ut in antecedente Articulo ostensum est, constare potest, quod omnes qui in Amore dominandi ex amore sui sunt, se vertant retro a Domino. Quod ita ex opposito se vertant, est quia illi qui in amore in Dominum sunt, non plus amant quam duci a Domino, ac volunt ut solus Dominus dominetur; at qui in amore dominandi ex amore sui sunt, non plus amant quam duci a semet, et volunt ut ipsi soli dominentur. Dicitur amor dominandi ex amore sui, quia datur amor dominandi ex amore faciendi usus, qui amor, quia unum facit cum amore erga proximum, est amor spiritualis: verum hic amor non vocari potest amor dominandi, sed amor faciendi usus. </p>
