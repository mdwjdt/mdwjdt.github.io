<h4 align="center"></h4><p>63、综上所述，可知受造宇宙的每一个事物都显示出与人的相似之处；然而，这一点只能隐约看出来。但在灵界，这一点是显而易见的。灵界也有三个王国的一切事物，天使就在它们当中；他看到周围的这些事物，也知道它们是他的代表。事实上，当其理解力的至内层被打开时，他便在它们里面认出自己，看到自己在它们里面的形像，几乎就像照镜子。</p>

63. What has been cited thus far tells us that there is some reference to the human form in everything in the created universe, but it enables us to see this fact only obscurely. In the spiritual world, though, people see this clearly. Everything in the three kingdoms exists there as well, surrounding each angel. Angels see these things around themselves and also are aware that they are pictures of their own selves. In fact, when the very heart of their understanding is opened, they recognize themselves and see their own image in their surroundings, almost like a reflection in a mirror. </p>

63. That every constituent of the created universe exhibits a resemblance to the human being may indeed be known from the foregoing observations, and yet be only dimly seen. In the spiritual world, however, it is clearly seen. All constituents of the three kingdoms exist there, too, and in the midst of them stands the angel. He sees these things about him, and also knows that they are representations of him. Indeed, when the inmost plane of his intellect is opened, he recognizes himself and sees his image in them, almost as if he were looking in a mirror. </p>

63. That there is a relation of all things of the created universe to man can indeed be known from the foregoing statements, though seen only obscurely, whereas in the spiritual world this is clearly seen. In that world are also all things of the three kingdoms, and in the midst of them is the angel. He sees those around him and he also knows that they are his representations. Indeed, when the inmost of his understanding is opened, he recognizes himself and sees in them his image, practically in no other way than as in a mirror. </p>

63. That there is a relation of all things of the created universe to man may be known from the foregoing statements, yet it can be seen only obscurely; whereas in the spiritual world this is seen clearly. In that world, also, there are all things of the three kingdoms, and in the midst of them the angel; he sees them about him, and also knows that they are representations of himself; yea, when the inmost of his understanding is opened he recognizes himself in them, and sees his image in them, hardly otherwise than as in a mirror. </p>

<p>
63. Quod omnium Universi creati relatio sit ad hominem, ex allatis quidem sciri potest, sed non videri nisi obscure; at in Mundo spirituali videtur id clare; ibi omnia trium Regnorum etiam sunt, in quorum medio est Angelus; videt illa circum se, et quoque scit quod sint repraesentationes ejus; imo quando intimum ejus intellectus aperitur, cognoscit se, et videt imaginem suam in illis, vix aliter quam sicut in speculo. </p>
