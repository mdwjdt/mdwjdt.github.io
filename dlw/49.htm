<h4 align="center"></h4><p>49、至于神，祂不可能去爱里面有任何无限之物，或任何爱的本质和生命本身，或任何神性的其他人，并反过来被他们所爱。因为如果他们真有无限，或爱本身的本质和生命，也就是神性的任何事物在里面，神就不是被其他人所爱，而是自己爱自己了。因为无限或神性，是独一无二者，不可分割；如果这无限或神性真的在其他人里面，那么他们就会是神性，这爱就会是对自我的爱，而神里面绝无可能有这种爱的一丝痕迹，因为它与神性本质完全对立。因此，爱与被爱这种关系必存在于其他没有丝毫神性之物在里面的人之中。下文将看到，这在神性所创造的受造物中是可能的。然而，这种可能性需要与无限的爱合而为一的无限智慧；也就是说，需要神性智慧的神性之爱与神性之爱的神性智慧(对此，参看34-39节)。</p>

<p>
49. In regard to God, loving and being loved in return are not possible in the case of others who have some share of infinity or anything of the essence and life of intrinsic love or of Divinity. If there were within them any share of infinity or anything of the essence and life of intrinsic love--of Divinity, that is--it would not be others who would be loving God. He would be loving himself. What is infinite or divine is unique. If it were in others, it would still be itself; and it would be pure love for itself, of which there cannot be the slightest trace in God. This is absolutely opposite to the divine essence. For love to be mutual, then, it needs to be a love for others in whom there is nothing of intrinsic Divinity; and we will see below [<a href="55.htm" target=_top>55</a>, <a href="305.htm" target=_top>305</a>] that it is a love for others who were created by Divinity.<p>For this to happen, though, there must be an infinite wisdom that is at one with infinite love. That is, there must be the divine love of divine wisdom and the divine wisdom of divine love discussed above (<a href="34.htm" target=_top>34-39</a>). </p>

49. In regard to God, the possibility of loving and being loved in return cannot be found in others who have in them anything of the infinite, or anything of the essence and life of love in itself, or anything of the Divine. For if they were to have in them anything of the infinite, or of the essence and life of love in itself, that is, anything of the Divine, God would not in that case be loved by others, but would be loving Himself. For the infinite or Divine is indivisible. If this were to exist in others, they would be the Divine, and the love would be love of self, not a particle of which can possibly exist in God. For the love of self is altogether opposite to the Divine essence.<p>Consequently the possibility of loving and being loved in return must be found in others who have in them nothing of the Divine in itself. It will be seen below that this is possible in beings created by the Divine. The possibility, however, requires infinite wisdom, in union with infinite love. That is, it requires the Divine love of Divine wisdom and the Divine wisdom of Divine love (of which above, nos. <a href="34.htm">34-39</a>). </p>

<p>
49. With respect to God, it is impossible for Him to love others and be reciprocally loved by those in whom there is anything of infinity, or anything of the essence and life of love in itself or anything of the Divine. For if there were in them anything of infinity or of the essence and life of love in itself, that is, anything of the Divine, then He would not be loved by others but would be loving Himself, for the Infinite or the Divine is the One Only. If this [Infinity] were in others, it would be Very Reality, and would be the love of self, the least trace of which cannot be in God, for this is entirely opposed to the Divine Essence. Wherefore [loving and being loved] must be in others in whom there is nothing of the Divine in itself. That it is possible in beings created by the Divine will be seen below. But so that it may be possible, there must be Infinite Wisdom making one with Infinite Love; that is, there must be the Divine Love of Divine Wisdom, and the Divine Wisdom of Divine Love, concerning which see above (<a href="34.htm">34-39</a>). </p>

<p>
49. With respect to God: it is impossible for Him to love others and to be loved reciprocally by others in whom there is anything of infinity, that is, anything of the essence and life of love in itself, or anything of the Divine. For if there were beings having in them anything of infinity, that is, of the essence and life of love in itself, that is, of the Divine, it would not be God loved by others, but God loving Himself; since the Infinite, that is, the Divine, is one only, and if this were in others, Itself would be in them, and would be the love of self Itself; and of that love not the least trace can possibly be in God, since it is wholly opposed to the Divine Essence. Consequently, for this relation to be possible there must be others in whom there is nothing of the Divine in itself. That it is possible in beings created from the Divine will be seen below. But that it may be possible, there must be Infinite Wisdom making one with Infinite Love; that is, there must be the Divine Love of Divine Wisdom, and the Divine Wisdom of Divine Love (concerning which see above, n. 35 <a href="34.htm" target=_top>34-39</a>) </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #49 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
49. Quod Deum attinet: amare et reciproce amari non potest dari in aliis, in quibus est aliquid infiniti, seu aliquid essentiae et vitae amoris in se, seu aliquid Divini; si enim aliquid infiniti, seu essentiae et vitae amoris in se, hoc est, aliquid Divini, esset in illis, tunc non amaretur ab aliis, sed amaret se; infinitum enim seu Divinum est unicum; si hoc in aliis foret, forent <sup>1</sup>
Ipsum, ac foret Ipse amor sui, cujus ne hilum dari potest in Deo; hoc enim prorsus oppositum est Essentiae Divinae; quare [amare et reciproce amari] dabitur in aliis, in quibus nihil Divini in se, est: quod id detur in creatis a Divino, infra videbitur. Sed ut detur, erit Infinita Sapientia, quae unum faciet cum Infinito Amore; hoc est, erit Divinus Amor Divinae Sapientiae et Divina Sapientia Divini Amoris, de quo supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_49/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_34" target=_top>34-39</a>. <p>
