<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">2.5 灵界太阳出现在中间高度处，距离天使犹如自然界的太阳距离世人那样遥远</h4><p>103、从世界来的人大多带有这样的观念：神在头顶上的高处，主在天堂就住在天使中间。他们之所以带有这样的神观，是因为在圣言中，神被称为“至高者”，经上说祂“住在高处”。因此，人们在祷告和敬拜时会举目抬手；殊不知，“至高者”表示至内层。他们之所以带有主在天堂住在天使中间的观念，是因为当人们思想祂时，就像思想其他人一样，或像思想一位天使一样；殊不知，主是那掌管宇宙的绝对独一的神。主若真的住在天堂天使中间，就无法将宇宙置于祂的注视、看顾和掌管之下了。若非祂在那些身在灵界的人面前像太阳那样照耀，天使就不可能获得任何光明。因为天使是属灵的，因而唯有属灵之光才适合他们的本质。在下文讨论层级的地方，我们会看到：天堂有光，这光远远胜过地上的光。</p>

103. The sun of the spiritual world is seen at a middle elevation, as far from angels as our physical world's sun is from us. Many people bring with them from our world an image of God as high overhead and of the Lord as being in heaven among its angels. The reason they bring an image of God as high overhead is that God is called "most high" in the Word, and it says that he lives "on high." This is why we lift up our eyes and our hands when we pray and worship, unaware that "highest" means "inmost."<p>The reason people bring along an image of the Lord as being in heaven among its angels is that they think of him only as being like any other individual, or like an angel. They do not realize that the Lord is the real and only God, the one who rules the universe. If he were living in heaven among the angels, he could not keep the universe under his sight and hold it in his care and keeping. If he were not shining like the sun on the people in the spiritual world, angels could not have any light. Angels, that is, are spiritual beings, so only spiritual light is suited to their essence. When I discuss levels later [<a href="182.htm" target=_top>182</a>], we will see that there is a light in the heavens that is far, far greater than our light on earth. </p>

103. The sun in the spiritual world appears at a middle height as distant from the angels as the sun in the natural world does from people. Most people coming from the world bring with them an idea of God as being at a height above their head, and of the Lord as being in heaven among the angels.<p>They bring with them an idea of God as being at a height above their head because God is called in the Word the Most High, and is said to dwell on high. Consequently they raise their eyes and hands upward when they entreat Him and worship Him - not knowing that by "most high" is meant inmost.<p>They bring with them an idea of the Lord as being in heaven among the angels because they think of Him only as being like any other man, and some as being like an angel - not knowing that the Lord is the one and only absolute God who rules the universe. If He were to be among the angels in heaven, He could not hold the universe under His gaze and under His direction and government. And if He did not shine before the eyes of those who are in the spiritual world as a sun, it would be impossible for angels to have any light. For angels are spiritual beings, and therefore the only light that is suited to their essence is spiritual light. That there is light in heaven, surpassing by far light on earth, will be seen below where we take up degrees. </p>

103. THE SUN OF THE SPIRITUAL WORLD APPEARS IN THE MIDDLE ALTITUDE DISTANT FROM THE ANGELS AS THE SUN OF THE NATURAL WORLD FROM MEN <p>Very many people carry with them an idea of God as being above the head on high, and of the Lord as being in heaven among the angels. They carry this idea of God as being above the head on high because in the Word God is called "The Most High" and is said to dwell "on high." For this reason they raise the eyes and hands upwards when they pray and worship, not knowing that by "the most high" is signified the inmost. They carry the idea of the Lord as being in heaven among the angels because they do not think of Him except as of another man, and certain ones as of an angel, not knowing that the Lord is the Very and Only God Who rules the universe. And if He were among the angels in heaven He could not have the universe under His view and under His protection and government. And if He did not shine as a Sun before those who are in the spiritual world, the angels could not have any light. For angels are spiritual, and therefore no other light than spiritual light is suitable to their essence. That there is light in the heavens greatly exceeding the light on earth will be seen below where degrees are treated. </p>

103. THE SUN OF THE SPIRITUAL WORLD APPEARS AT A MIDDLE ALTITUDE, FAR OFF FROM THE ANGELS, LIKE THE SUN OF THE NATURAL WORLD FROM MEN. <p>Most people take with them out of the world an idea of God, as being above the head, on high, and an idea of the Lord, as living in heaven among the angels. They take with them this idea of God because, in the Word, God is called the "Most High," and is said to "dwell on high;" therefore in prayer and worship men raise their eyes and hands upwards, not knowing that by "The Most High" is signified the inmost. They take with them the idea of the Lord as being in heaven among the angels, because men think of Him as they think of another man, some thinking of Him as they think of an angel, not knowing that the Lord is the Very and Only God who rules the universe, who if He were among the angels in heaven, could not have the universe under His gaze and under His care and government. And unless He shone as a sun before those who are in the spiritual world, angels could have no light; for angels are spiritual, and therefore no other than spiritual light is in accord with their essence. That there is light in the heavens, immensely exceeding the light on earth, will be seen below where degrees are discussed. </p>

103. QUOD SOL MUNDI SPIRITUALIS APPAREAT IN MEDIA ALTITUDINE DISTANS AB ANGELIS, SICUT SOL MUNDI NATURALIS AB HOMINIBUS. Plerique e Mundo ferunt secum ideam de Deo quod sit supra caput in alto, et de Domino quod sit in Coelo inter Angelos. Quod ferant ideam de Deo, quod sit supra caput in alto, est quia Deus in Verbo vocatur Altissimus, et dicitur quod habitet <sup>1</sup>
in alto; quare elevant oculos <sup>2</sup>
et manus sursum cum supplicant et adorant; non scientes quod per Altissimum significetur intimum. Quod ferant ideam de Domino quod sit in Coelo inter angelos, est quia de Ipso non cogitant aliter quam sicut de alio homine, et quidam sicut de angelo; non scientes quod Dominus sit Ipse et Unicus Deus, qui regit Universum; qui si inter angelos in Coelo esset, non potuisset universum sub sua intuitione, subque suo auspicio et regimine habere; et si non coram illis, qui in Mundo spirituali sunt, luceret ut Sol, non potuisset Angelis aliqua lux esse; sunt enim Angeli spirituales, et ideo non alia lux illorum essentiae convenit quam lux spiritualis; quod lux in coelis sit, immensum excedens lucem in terris, videbitur infra ubi de gradibus. <p>
