<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第78节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>78、表面上看，神性在不同的人身上似乎是不同的；例如，它在智慧人和简单人身上不同，或在老人和孩子身上不同。但这只是一个表象所产生的谬论；人可能是不同的，但他里面的神性却无不同。人是一个接受者，接受者或容器是可变的。智慧人对神性之爱与神性智慧的接受，比简单人更充分，因而更完全；智慧的老人则比小孩子或少年人接受得更多。然而，神性在这一个和在那一个身上是一样的。神性在天上的天使和地上的世人身上不一样的谬论同样是由表象产生的，因为天上的天使拥有无法形容的智慧，而世人则没有。不过，这种表面的不同不在于主，而在于接受者，取决于他们对神性的接受品质。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #78 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
78. It does seem as though Divinity were not the same in one person as in another, as though it were different in a wise person than in a simple one, for example, or different in an elderly one than in a child. This is just the deceptive way things seem, though. The person may be different, but Divinity within is not. The person is a receiver, and the receiver or vessel will differ. A wise person is a more adequate receiver of divine love and wisdom than a simple one, and therefore a fuller receiver. An elderly and wise individual is more receptive than a child or youth. Still, Divinity is the same in the one as in the other.<p>Outward appearance also gives rise to the illusion that Divinity is different in heaven's angels than it is in people on earth because heaven's angels enjoy indescribable wisdom and we do not. However, this apparent difference is in the subjects and depends on their openness to Divinity. It is not in the Lord. </p>

78. It appears as though the Divine were not the same in one individual as in another, being seemingly of a different character in a wise person than in a simple one, for example, or of a different character in an elderly person than in a young child. But this is, owing to the appearance, a fallacy. The person may be of a different character, but the Divine is not of a different character in him. The person is a recipient, and a recipient or receiving vessel is variable. The wise person is a recipient of the Divine love and wisdom more amply, thus more fully, than the simple person, and the elderly person who is at the same time wise more than the young child or juvenile. But still the Divine is the same in the one and the other.<p>It is likewise, owing to the appearance, a fallacy that the Divine is not the same in angels in heaven as in people on earth, because angels in heaven possess an inexpressible wisdom that people do not. But the apparent difference lies not in the Lord, but in the recipients in accordance with the quality of their reception of the Divine. </p>

<p>
78. It appears as if the Divine were not the same in one person as in another, as if, for instance, it were different in the wise than in the simple, and different in an old person than in a little child. But this is a fallacy arising from appearance. It is the man that is different, but the Divine in him is not different. Man is a recipient, and the recipient or receptacle is what varies. A wise man is, more adequately, thus more fully than a simple man, a recipient of the Divine Love and Wisdom; and an old man who is also wise, more than a little child or a boy. But still the Divine is the same in the one as in the other. Similarly, it is a fallacy arising from appearance that the Divine varies with the angels of heaven and with men on earth, because the angels are in ineffable wisdom, while men are not. But the seeming variation is in the subjects in accordance with the quality of their reception of the Divine, and not in the Lord. </p>

<p>
78. It seems as if the Divine were not the same in one person as in another; as if, for instance, it were different in the wise and in the simple, or in an old man and in a child. But this is a fallacy arising from appearance; the man is different, but the Divine in him is not different. Man is a recipient, and the recipient or receptacle is what varies. A wise man is a recipient of Divine Love and Divine Wisdom more adequately, and therefore more fully, than a simple man; and an old man who is also wise, more than a little child or boy; yet the Divine is the same in the one as in the other. It is in like manner a fallacy arising from appearance, that the Divine is different with angels of heaven from what it is with men on the earth, because the angels of heaven are in wisdom ineffable, while men are not; but the seeming difference is not in the Lord but in the subjects, according to the quality of their reception of the Divine. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #78 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
78. Apparet sicut Divinum non sit idem in uno homine ut in altero, ut quod sit aliud in sapiente quam in simplici, et aliud in sene quam in infante; sed hoc ex apparentia est fallacia; est homo alius, sed Divinum non est aliud in illo; homo est recipiens, ac recipiens seu receptaculum est varium; sapiens homo est recipiens Divini Amoris et Divinae Sapientiae adaequatius, ita plenius, quam simplex homo; ac senex qui etiam sapiens est, plus quam infans et puer; sed usque Divinum est idem in uno et in altero. Similiter ex apparentia est fallacia, quod Divinum sit varium apud Angelos coeli et apud homines telluris, quia Angeli Coeli in sapientia ineffabili sunt, non ita homines; sed apparens varium est in subjectis secundum quale receptionis Divini, et non in Domino. </p>
