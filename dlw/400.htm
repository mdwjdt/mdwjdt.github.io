400, 2. Love or volition is constantly striving toward the human form and toward everything the human form comprises. This we can see from the way the heart corresponds to volition, since we know how everything in the body is formed in the womb. We know that everything is formed there by fibers from the brain and by blood vessels from the heart and the fabric of all our organs and viscera are made from these two materials. This enables us to see that everything within us comes into being from the life of our volition, which is love, from beginnings in our brains, through these fibers, with everything in our bodies coming from the heart through its arteries and veins.<p>Clearly then, life (which is love and its consequent volition) is constantly striving toward the human form; and since the human form comprises everything that is within us, it follows that love or volition is engaged in a constant effort to form all these things. The reason this effort is toward the human form is that God is a Person and divine love and wisdom is the life of that Person. This is the source of every trace of life.<p>Everyone can see that if the life that is the essential person were not activating something that intrinsically is not life, nothing that is within us could be formed the way it is. There are thousands upon thousands of things within us that are acting in unison, totally united in their effort toward an image of the life that is their source so that we can become his vessel and dwelling.<p>We can see from this that love--and from love, our volition, and from volition, our hearts--is constantly striving toward the human form. </p>

400. (2) Love or the will continually strives toward the human form and toward all the elements that make up the human form. This is apparent from the correspondence of the heart with the will, for we know that all the constituents of the body are formed in the womb, that they are formed by fibers from the brain and by blood vessels from the heart, and that the structures of all the organs and viscera are composed from these two elements. It is apparent therefore that all the constituents of the human being arise from the life of the will, which is love, from its first elements in the brain through fibers, and that all the constituents of his body arise from the heart through the arteries and veins.<p>It is clearly apparent from this that life - which is love and consequently the will - continually strives toward the human form. And because the human form consists of all the elements found in the human being, it follows that love or the will is engaged in a continual endeavor and effort to form all those elements.<p>Its endeavor and effort is toward the human form for the reason that God is human, and Divine love and wisdom constitute His life, from which comes everything connected with life.<p>Everyone can see that unless life which is supremely human operated in that which in itself is without life, nothing found in the human being could have been formed as it is in him, in whom there are millions of components which function as a unit and which conspire with one accord to produce an image of the life from which they spring, in order that the person may become its recipient vessel and abode.<p>It can be seen from this that love, and in consequence of love, the will, and in consequence of the will, the heart, continually strive toward the human form. </p>

400. (ii) Love or the will strives continually towards the human form and all things thereof This is evident from the correspondence of the heart with the will. For it is well known that all things of the body are formed in the womb by means of fibres from the brains and blood vessels from the heart, and that the tissues of all the organs and viscera come from these two sources; from which it is clear that all things of man have existence from the life of the will, which is love, from their beginnings out of the brains through the fibres; and all things of his body out of the heart through the arteries and veins. From these things it is clearly evident that life, which is love and the will therefrom, strives continually towards the human form; and since the human form is composed of all things that are in man, it follows that love or the will is in the constant conatus and endeavour to form all those things. There is a conatus and endeavour towards the human form because God is Man, and Divine Love and Wisdom is His Life, from which comes the whole of life. Everyone can see that unless Life, which is very Man, were acting into that which is not life in itself, nothing could be formed such as exists in man, in whom thousands of things go to make one thing, and with one consent aspire to the likeness of the Life from which they sprang, in order that man can become His receptacle and dwelling-place. From these things it may be seen that love, and from love the will, and from the will the heart, strive continually towards the human form. </p>

400. (2) Love or the will strives unceasingly towards the human form and all things of that form. This is evident from the correspondence of heart and will. For it is known that all things of the body are formed in the womb, and that they are formed by means of fibers from the brains and blood vessels from the heart, and that out of these two the tissues of all organs and viscera are made; from which it is evident that all things of man have their existence from the life of the will, which is love, from their first principles, out of the brains, through the fibers; and all things of his body out of the heart through the arteries and veins. From this it is clearly evident that life (which is love and the will therefrom), strives unceasingly towards the human form. And as the human form is made up of all the things there are in man, it follows that love or the will is in a continual conatus and effort to form all these. There is such a conatus and effort towards the human form, because God is a Man, and Divine Love and Divine Wisdom is His life, and from His life is everything of life. Any one can see that unless Life which is very Man acted into that which in itself is not life, the formation of anything such as exists in man would be impossible, in whom are thousands of thousands of things that make a one, and that unanimously aspire to an image of the Life from which they spring, that man may become a receptacle and abode of that Life. From all this it can be seen that love, and out of the love the will, and out of the will the heart, strive unceasingly towards the human form. </p>

400. [II.] Quod Amor seu Voluntas in humanam formam continue nitatur, et in omnia quae humanae formae sunt, patet a correspondentia cordis cum voluntate, nam notum est, quod omnia corporis formentur in utero, et quod formentur per fibras e cerebris, et per vasa sanguinea ex corde, et quod contexturae omnium organorum et viscerum ex illis binis fiant; ex quo patet, quod omnia hominis ex vita voluntatis, quae est amor, a principiis suis e cerebris per fibras existant, et quod omnia corporis ejus ex corde per arterias et venas. Ex his manifeste patet, quod vita, quae est amor et inde voluntas, in humanam formam continue nitatur; et quia humana forma consistit ex omnibus illis, quae in homine sunt, sequitur quod amor seu voluntas in continuo conatu et nisu formandi omnia illa sit: quod conatus et nisus sit in humanam formam, est quia Deus est Homo, ac Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia est Vita Ipsius, <sup>1</sup>
e qua omne vitae est. Quisque videre potest, <sup>2</sup>
quod nisi Vita, quae est Ipse Homo, ageret in id quod in se non vita est, non potuisset aliquid tale formari quod in homine est, in quo sunt millia millium quae unum faciunt, ac unanimiter conspirant ad imaginem Vitae a qua, ut possit homo receptaculum et habitaculum Ipsius fieri. Ex his videri potest, quod Amor, et ex amore Voluntas, et ex voluntate Cor, in humanam formam continue nitantur. <p>
