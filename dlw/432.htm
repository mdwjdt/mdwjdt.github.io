<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">5.5 受孕时人的初始形态或雏形及其性质</h4><p>432、没有人知道受孕后在子宫里，人的初始形态或雏形是何性质，因为它无法被看到。此外，它是由属灵物质构成的，这种物质无法凭属世之光被看到。由于世上有些人渴望研究人的初始形态，也就是来自父亲、藉以实现怀孕的精子，还由于他们当中有许多人陷入误区，认为人从最初的开始，也就是雏形时就存在于他的完整形式中，后来随着成长而得以完善，所以在其真正形式中的这个雏形或最初起源是何性质，便透露给我。天使们向我透露了这一切，因为主已经把它揭示给他们；由于天使把它变成他们智慧的一部分，并且与他人交流他们所知道的，是天使的智慧快乐，所以得到许可之后，他们在天堂之光中将人的初始形态的模型呈现在我眼前，其性质如下：<br><br>它看上去就像一个脑的微小图像，前面有一张未界定的脸的模糊轮廓，没有任何附属物。上部，就是这个雏形或初始形态的凸起部分，有一个由连续的小球状或球形物质构成的结构，每个小球状物质是由更细小的球状物质构成，每个更细小的球状物质以同样的方式由最细小的球状物质构成。因此，它是由三个层级构成的。在前面，在扁平或凹形部分，我看见一张脸的未界定轮廓。凸起部分被一层极其娇嫩的皮肤，或非常薄的透明薄膜或脑膜覆盖。凸起部分，也就是最小形式的脑的模型，也被分成两片脑叶，可以说，就像最大形式的脑被分成了两个脑半球。我被告知，右脑叶是接受爱的容器，左脑叶是接受智慧的容器；通过巧妙的交织，它们就像配偶和家庭伴侣。<br><br>此外，我在照亮它的天堂之光中还看到，就内部方向和连续运动而言，这小小的脑的内部结构处于天堂的秩序和形式，而它的外部结构却与这秩序和形式直接对立。<br><br>这些事物被看到并展示之后，天使说，处于天堂秩序和形式的两个内在层级，是接受来自主的爱和智慧的容器；与天堂秩序和形式直接对立的外在层级是接受地狱之爱和疯狂的容器；原因在于，因着遗传的缺陷，人生在各种邪恶中，这些邪恶就存在于那里最外层的成分中。此外，他们说，这种缺陷无法被移除，除非更高层级被打开；这些层级就是我们所说的接受来自主的爱和智慧的容器。由于爱和智慧才是本质上的人，因为爱和智慧本质上就是主，人的这个初始形态就是一个容器，故可知，这个初始形态拥有一种不断朝向它也逐渐取得的人类形式的努力在里面。（全书完）</p><br><p align="center"><a href="431.htm">上一节</a>　 <a href="0.htm">目录</a></p>

432. The nature of our first stage after conception. No one can know what our first or primal stage in the womb after conception is like because we cannot see it. Further, it is composed of a spiritual substance that is not visible in physical light. Some people in this world are inclined to focus their minds on our primal stage, the father's semen that is the agent of conception, and many of them have fallen into the error of thinking that we are complete humans from the very first and then reach completeness simply by getting larger. For this reason, some angels to whom the Lord had revealed it showed me what this first or primal stage of ours is like with respect to its form. Since they had made this a matter of their wisdom and since the delight of that wisdom was to share what they knew with others, they were given permission to present a representation of that initial form of ours to my own eyes in heaven's light.<p>It was like this. I saw what seemed to be a tiny image of a brain with a sort of face drawn faintly on its front, with no appendages. On its upper convex part, this primal form was a composite of closely connected little balls or spheres. Each sphere was made up of still smaller spheres, and each of these of spheres still smaller. This meant that there were three levels. Something that looked like a face was outlined on the front, concave part.<p>The convex part was enveloped by a very thin, transparent meningeal membrane. The convex part, the miniature image of a brain, was also divided into what seemed to be two lobes the way the full-scale brain is divided into two hemispheres. I was told that the right lobe was the vessel of love and that the left lobe was the vessel of wisdom, and that by some incredibly intricate connections they were like partners or roommates.<p>In the light of heaven, a radiant light, the angels also showed me that inwardly this composite structure of a miniature brain was in the design and form of heaven with respect to both its setting and its flow, while the outer composite structure was opposed to that design and that form.<p>Once I had seen what they showed me, the angels said that the two inner levels, the ones that were in the design and form of heaven, were vessels of love and wisdom from the Lord, while the outer level, the one that was opposed to heaven's design and form, was a vessel of hellish love and madness. This is because we are born into all kinds of evil because of our hereditary imperfection, and these evils are located in our outermost natures. These flaws cannot be eliminated unless our higher levels are opened, the levels that are vessels of love and wisdom from the Lord, as already noted. Further, since love and wisdom are the essential person, love and wisdom being the Lord in essence, and since this primal stage of ours is a vessel, it follows that there is in this primal stage a constant striving toward the human form, a form that it gradually takes on.<p>THE END </p>

<p>432. The rudimentary form of the human being and its nature from conception. The nature of the rudimentary or initial form of the human being in the womb after conception is something no one can know, because it cannot be seen. Moreover, it also originates from a spiritual essence, which in natural light does not fall within the scope of the eye.<p>Now because some people in the world are of a temperament to direct their minds even to an investigation of the elemental form of the human being or paternal seed that occasions conception, and because many of them have fallen into the error of thinking that the human being exists in its complete form from its first origin or commencement, and is afterward perfected by growing, I have had disclosed to me the nature of that commencement or first origin in its true form.<p>This was disclosed to me by angels who had it revealed to them by the Lord; and because they incorporated it into their wisdom, and it is the delight of their wisdom to communicate to others what they know, therefore they were given permission to present before my eyes in the light of heaven a model of the human being's initial form, the nature of which was as follows.<p> </p>
<p>[2] I saw what looked like the tiny image of a brain, having the faint outline of an undefined face in front, without any appendage. The upper, convex part of this rudimentary form had a structure composed of contiguous little globular or spherical masses, and each little spherical mass was composed of ones still more minute, and each of these in like manner of ones the most minute of all. Thus it consisted of three degrees. It was in the concave part of this toward the front that I saw the undefined outline of a face.<p>The convex part was covered with a very thin membrane or meninx, which was transparent.<p>The convex part, which was the model of a cerebrum in miniature, was also divided into two, shall I say, prominences, as the cerebrum in its larger form is divided into two hemispheres. And I was told that the right prominence was a recipient vessel of love, and the left prominence a recipient vessel of wisdom, and that through marvelous interconnections they were as though consorts and domestic partners.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Furthermore I was shown in the light of heaven that shone upon it that the structure of the image's little cerebellum was, in respect to its inner orientation and continuous motion, in the order and form of heaven, and that its outer structure was in conflict with it in opposition to that order and form.<p> </p>
<p>[4] After I had seen and been shown the foregoing, the angels told me that the two inner degrees, which were in the order and form of heaven, were recipient vessels of love and wisdom from the Lord, and that the outer degree, which was in conflict with them in opposition to the order and form of heaven, was the recipient vessel of hellish love and insanity - the reason being that a person is born by a hereditary defect into evils of every kind, and that these evils are seated in the outermost constituents there. Moreover, they said that this defect is not removed unless the higher degrees are opened, which, as we said, are recipient vessels of love and wisdom from the Lord.<p>So then, because love and wisdom are the essence of what it is to be human - since love and wisdom in their essence are the Lord, and this initial form of a person is their recipient vessel - it follows that this initial form has within it a continual effort toward the human form, which it also gradually assumes. </p>

<p>432. WHAT MAN'S INITIAL FORM IS AT CONCEPTION <p>What man's initial or primitive [form] is in the womb after conception no one can know, since it cannot be seen; moreover, it is formed out of spiritual substance, which is not visible by natural light. Now since there are some in the world who turn their minds to searching out even the primitive form of man, that is, the seed from the father by which conception is effected, and since many of them have fallen into the error, that man is in his fulness from his first beginning, which is the rudiment, and is afterwards perfected by growth, it has been disclosed to me what that rudiment or first is in its form. This has been disclosed to me by angels, to whom it was revealed by the Lord; and because they had made it part of their wisdom, and it is a delight of their wisdom to communicate what they know to others, permission having been granted, they presented before my eyes in the light of heaven a type of man's initial form, which was like this. It seemed like a tiny image of the brain with a delicate delineation of something of a face in front without any appendage. This primitive in the upper convex part was a structure of globules or spherules touching one another, and each spherule was a compounding of those yet more minute, and each of these in like manner of those still more minute; it was thus of three degrees. In front, in the flat part, something outlined appeared to represent a face. The convex part was covered round about with a skin or membrane so fine as to be transparent. The convex part, which was a type of the brain in least forms, was also divided into two lobes, as it were, just as the brain in its greatest extent is divided into two hemispheres. I was informed that the right lobe was the receptacle of love, and the left lobe was the receptacle of wisdom; and that by their wonderful interweavings they were, as it were, consorts and partners. It was further shown in the light of heaven, which shone brightly upon it, that the structure of this little brain, as to its arrangement and flux, was in the order and form of heaven, and that its outer structure was in direct opposition to that order and form. After these things had been shown and seen, the angels said that the two interior degrees, which were in the order and form of heaven, were receptacles of love and wisdom from the Lord; and that the outer degree, which was in direct opposition to the order and form of heaven, was a receptacle of infernal love and folly; for the reason that man by hereditary defilement is born into evils of every kind, and these evils remain there in outermosts; and that these defilements are not removed unless the higher degrees are opened, which, as was said, are receptacles of love and wisdom from the Lord. And since love and wisdom are very man, for love and wisdom in their essence are the Lord, and this primitive of man is a receptacle, it follows that in that primitive there is a continuous striving to attain the human form, which indeed it gradually assumes. </p>

432. WHAT MAN'S BEGINNING IS FROM CONCEPTION. <p>What man's beginning or primitive form is in the womb after conception no one can know, because it cannot be seen; moreover, it is made up of spiritual substance, which is not visible by natural light. Now because there are some in the world who are eager to investigate even the primitive form of man, which is seed from the father, from which conception is effected, and because many of these have fallen into the error of thinking that man is in his fullness from his first, which is the rudiment, and is afterwards perfected by growth, it has been disclosed to me what that rudiment or first is in its form. It has been disclosed to me by angels, to whom it was revealed by the Lord; and because they had made it a part of their wisdom, and it is the joy of their wisdom to communicate to others what they know, permission having been granted, they presented before my eyes in the light of heaven a type of man's initial form, which was as follows: There appeared as it were a tiny image of a brain with a delicate delineation of something like a face in front, with no appendage. This primitive form in the upper convex part was a structure of contiguous globules or spherules, and each spherule was a joining together of those more minute, and each of these in like manner of those most minute. It was thus of three degrees. In front, in the flat part, a kind of delineation appeared for a face. The convex part was covered round about with a very delicate skin or membrane which was transparent. The convex part, which was a type of the brain in least forms, was also divided into two beds, as it were, just as the brain in its larger form is divided into hemispheres. It was told me that the right bed was the receptacle of love, and the left the receptacle of wisdom; and that by wonderful interweavings these were like consorts and partners. It was further shown in the light of heaven, which fell brightly on it, that the structure of this little brain within, as to position and movement, was in the order and form of heaven, and that its outer structure was in direct opposition to that order and form. After these things were seen and pointed out, the angels said that the two interior degrees, which were in the order and form of heaven, were the receptacles of love and wisdom from the Lord; and that the exterior degree, which was in direct opposition to the order and form of heaven, was the receptacle of hellish love and insanity; for the reason that man, by hereditary corruption, is born into evils of every kind, and these evils reside there in the outermosts; and that this corruption is not removed unless the higher degrees are opened, which, as was said, are the receptacles of love and wisdom from the Lord. And as love and wisdom are very man, for love and wisdom in their essence are the Lord, and this primitive form of man is a receptacle, it follows that in that primitive form there is a continual effort towards the human form, which also it gradually assumes. </p>

432. QUALE EST INITIAMENTUM HOMINIS A CONCEPTIONE. Quale est initiamentum seu primitivum hominis in utero post conceptionem, nemo potest scire, quia id non potest videri; et quoque ex spirituali substantia est, quae per lucem naturalem non cadit in visum. Nunc quia aliqui in Mundo tales sunt, ut intendant mentem etiam in indagationem Primitivi hominis, quod est semen a patre, a quo fit conceptio, <sup>1</sup>
et quia multi ex illis in illum errorem lapsi sunt, quod homo sit in suo pleno a primo suo, quod est inchoamentum, et quod dein increscendo perficiatur, detectum mihi est, quale id inchoamentum seu primum est in sua forma: hoc mihi detectum est ab angelis, quibus id revelatum est a Domino; qui quia id sapientiae suae fecerunt, ac jucundum sapientiae illorum est communicare aliis quod sciunt, ideo ex data venia formam initialem hominis in typo coram oculis meis in luce Coeli sistebant; quae talis erat:<p> </p>
<p>[2] visa est sicut minima imago Cerebri cum delineatione subtili alicujus faciei antrorsum, absque appendice: hoc primitivum in superiore gibba parte erat compages ex globulis seu sphaerulis contiguis, et unaquaevis sphaerula erat compaginata ex adhuc minutioribus, <sup>2</sup>
et unaquaevis ex his similiter ex minutissimis; ita trium graduum erat; anterius in parte sima delineatum quid pro facie apparuit. Gibbosa pars erat tenuissima membrana seu meninge circumtecta, quae transparens: gibba pars, <sup>3</sup>
quae erat typus cerebri in minimis, erat etiam divisa in binos quasi toros, sicut Cerebrum in maximis est in bina haemisphaeria, et dictum est mihi, quod dexter torus esset receptaculum amoris, et sinister torus receptaculum sapientiae, et quod per mirificas consertiones essent sicut consortes et contubernales.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Insuper monstratum est in luce coeli, quae affulsit, quod compages Cerebelluli hujus interius esset quoad situm et fluxionem in ordine et in forma coeli, et quod compages ejus exterior esset in opposito contra illum ordinem et illam formam.<p> </p>
<p>[4] Postquam haec visa et monstrata sunt, dixerunt Angeli, quod bini interiores gradus, qui erant in ordine et in forma coeli, essent receptacula amoris et sapientiae a Domino; et quod exterior gradus, qui in opposito erat contra ordinem et formam coeli, esset receptaculum amoris et insaniae infernalis; ex causa, quia homo ex labe haereditaria nascitur in mala omnis generis, et quod mala illa resideant in extremis ibi; et quod illa labes non removeatur, nisi aperiantur gradus superiores, qui, ut dictum est, sunt receptacula amoris et sapientiae a Domino: et quia Amor et Sapientia est ipse homo, est enim Amor et Sapientia in sua essentia Dominus, et hoc primitivum hominis est receptaculum, sequitur quod <sup>4</sup>
inde in primitivo illo sit continuus nisus in formam humanam, quam etiam successive induit. <p>
