<h4 align="center"></h4><p>62、正如地上的矿物有一种朝向植物的努力，植物也有一种朝向变得更活跃的努力。这解释了为何各种昆虫会被植物所发出的相应气味吸引。这不是源于自然界太阳的热，而是源于通过这热照其接受者的状态进行运作的生命，如下文将要看到的。</p>

62. Just as there is an energy in earth's minerals toward plant growth, there is an energy in plants toward movement. This is why there are various kinds of insect that are responsive to the fragrances they give off. We will see later [<a href="157.htm" target=_top>157-158</a>] that this is not caused by the warmth of our world's sun but comes through it, from life, according to the recipient vessels. </p>

62. Like the endeavor of minerals to endow themselves with vegetable forms is the endeavor of plants to endow themselves with animate forms. Hence the occurrence of various kinds of insects corresponding to their odorous exhalations. This does not originate from the heat of the world's sun, but from life by means of that heat in accordance with the form of its recipient vessels, as will be seen in following discussions. </p>

<p>
62. As there is an endeavour of the minerals of the earth towards vegetating, so there is an endeavour of plants to become more alive; hence insects of various kinds corresponding to odours emanating from plants. This does not arise from the heat of the world's sun, but from life through that heat according to the recipients, as will be seen in what follows. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #62 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
62. As there is an endeavor of the minerals of the earth towards vegetation, so there is an endeavor of the plants towards vivification: this accounts for insects of various kinds corresponding to the odors emanating from plants. This does not arise from the heat of this world's sun, but from life operating through that heat according to the state of its recipients (as will be seen in what follows). </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #62 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
62. Sicut est conatus minerarum terrae se vegetandi, ita est conatus vegetabilium se vivificandi; inde varii generis insecta odoriferis halitibus eorum correspondentia: quod hoc non sit ex calore solis mundi, sed per illum ex vita secundum recipientia, videbitur in sequentibus. </p>
