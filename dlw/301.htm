<h4 align="center"></h4><p>301、此外，从脱离空间的天使观念明显可知，除了神-人，也就是主以外，受造宇宙中没有一物拥有生命；也没有一物能活动，除非凭借来自祂的生命；若不通过来自祂的太阳，同样没有一物拥有存在；因此，这是一个真理，即：我们在神里面生活、行动并拥有我们的存在。</p>

301. Further, in the light of angelic concepts, which are nonspatial, it is perfectly clear that in the created universe there is nothing living except the Divine-Human One--the Lord--alone, that nothing moves except by life from God, and that nothing exists except by means of the sun from God. So it is true that in God we live and move and have our being. </p>

301. It is furthermore clearly apparent from angelic ideas, which are independent of space, that nothing in the created universe has life except the human God alone, or the Lord, that nothing moves except as the result of life from Him, and that nothing has existence except through the sun from Him - consequently that it is a truth that in God we live, move, and have our being. <sup>1</sup>

301. It is clearly evident, moreover, from angelic ideas which are apart from space, that, in the created universe, nothing lives except God-Man, that is, the Lord, and that nothing is moved except by life from Him, and that nothing has being except through the Sun from Him, and so, that it is the truth that, in God, we live, we move, and have our being. </p>

301. It is evident, moreover, from angelic ideas, which are apart from space, that in the created universe nothing lives except God-Man, that is, the Lord, neither is anything moved except by life from Him, nor has being except through the sun from Him; so that it is a truth, that in God we live, and move, and have our being. </p>

301. Praeterea ex Angelicis ideis, quae sunt absque spatio, manifeste patet, quod in Universo creato nihil vivat, quam solus Deus Homo, hoc est, Dominus, quodque nihil moveatur quam per vitam ab Ipso; et quod nihil sit quam per Solem ab Ipso; ita quod Veritas sit, quod in Deo vivamus, moveamur, et simus. </p>
