<h4 align="center"></h4><p>343、前面提到的地狱不仅与地上的这类事物相通，还与它们结合，这一点从以下事实可以推断出来：地狱不是远离人类，而是在他们周围，事实上就在恶人里面；因此，它们与大地接触。因为就其情感、欲望和随之而来的思维，以及源于它们的行为，也就是善用或恶用而言，一个人要么在天堂天使中间，要么在地狱灵中间。由于在地上所发现的那类事物也出现在天堂和地狱，所以可推知，每当条件成熟时，来自那里的流注就会直接产生这些事物。事实上，出现在灵界，无论天堂还是地狱的一切事物，都对应于情感或欲望，因为它们照着情感或欲望而存在于那里。因此，当本身属灵的情感或欲望遇到地上同质或相应的事物时，既会出现提供一个灵魂的属灵成分，也会出现提供一个身体的物质成分。此外，一切属灵事物都有一种用肉体包裹自身的努力在自己里面。地狱就围绕着人类，并由此与大地接触，因为灵界不在空间中，而是存在于凡有一种相对应的情感所在之地。</p>

343. The hells just mentioned have not only a communication but even a union with similar phenomena on earth. This follows from the fact that the hells are not distant from us but are around us and even in us when we are evil. They are therefore in direct contact with earth. We are surrounded by angels of heaven or by spirits of hell in regard to our desires and consequent thoughts and as to the deeds that result from them both, deeds that are either good or evil functions. Since the same kinds of thing we have on earth exist in the heavens and the hells as well, it follows that the inflow from that source produces such things directly when conditions are right. Everything visible in the spiritual world, whether in heaven or in hell, reflects passions and desires because everything there arises in response to them. As a result, when passions and desires that are intrinsically spiritual find circumstances that are congenial or responsive, there is something spiritual there that provides a soul and something physical that provides a body. There is in everything spiritual an inherent tendency to clothe itself with a body.<p>The reason the hells are around and are therefore in direct contact with the earth is that the spiritual world is not in space, but is found wherever there is a responsive feeling. </p>

343. That the aforementioned hells not only communicate but also are conjoined with such phenomena on earth can be concluded from the fact that the hells are not apart from people but surround them, being indeed in people who are evil, so that they are in contact with the earth. For in respect to his affections and lusts and consequent thoughts, and springing from these his actions, which are good or evil forms of use, a person is either in the midst of angels of heaven or in the midst of spirits of hell. And because the same phenomena found on earth are found also in the heavens and hells, it follows that an influx from there immediately produces these phenomena whenever the conditions are favorable.<p>Indeed, all phenomena appearing in the spiritual world, either in heaven or in hell, are correspondent forms of affections or lusts, for they exist there in accordance with them. Consequently, when affections or lusts, which in themselves are spiritual, meet homogeneous or corresponding conditions on earth, present is a spiritual component which provides a soul, and a material component which provides a body. Everything spiritual also has in it an endeavor to clothe itself with a body.<p>The hells surround mankind and so are in contact with the earth for the reason that the spiritual world does not exist in space, but is present wherever there is a corresponding affection. </p>

343. That the hells mentioned have not only communication but also conjunction with such things on earth may be concluded from this that the hells are not remote from men but are around them, indeed within those who are evil, thus they are contiguous to the earth. For man, as regards his affections and lusts and consequent thoughts, and as regards his actions springing from them which are good or evil uses, is in the midst either of angels of heaven or of spirits of hell; and as such things as are on the earth are also in the heavens and the hells, it follows that influx therefrom directly produces such things when the temperature is favourable. For all things that appear in the spiritual world whether in heaven or in hell are correspondences of affections or lusts, for they have existence there in accordance with these. Consequently when affections or lusts which in themselves are spiritual meet with homogeneous or corresponding things on earth, there is present both the spiritual which provides a soul and the material which provides a body. Also within everything spiritual there is a conatus to clothe itself with a body. The hells are around man and hence contiguous to the earth, because the spiritual world is not in space, but is where there is corresponding affection. </p>

343. That the hells mentioned above have not only communication but conjunction with such things in the earths may be concluded from this, that the hells are not distant from men, but are about them, yea, are within those who are evil; thus they are contiguous to the earth; for man, in regard to his affections and lusts, and consequent thoughts, and in regard to his actions springing from these, which are good or evil uses, is in the midst either of angels of heaven or of spirits of hell; and as such things as are on the earth are also in the heavens and hells, it follows that influx therefrom directly produces such things when the conditions are favorable. All things, in fact, that appear in the spiritual world, whether in heaven or in hell, are correspondences of affections or lusts, for they take form there in accordance with these; consequently when affections or lusts, which in themselves are spiritual, meet with homogeneous or corresponding things in the earths, there are present both the spiritual that furnishes a soul, and the material that furnishes a body. Moreover, within everything spiritual there is a conatus to clothe itself with a body. The hells are about men, and therefore contiguous to the earth, because the spiritual world is not in space, but is where there is a corresponding affection. </p>

<p>
 343. Quod Inferna supradicta habeant non modo communicationem sed etiam conjunctionem cum talibus in terris, concludi potest ex eo, quod Inferna non remota sint ab hominibus, sed quod sint circum illos, imo in illis qui mali sunt[;] ita sunt contigua terris: homo enim quoad suas affectiones et cupiditates, et inde cogitationes, et ex his et illis quoad suos actus, qui sunt boni aut mali usus, est vel in medio angelorum coeli, vel in medio spirituum inferni; et quia talia quae super terris etiam in coelis et infernis sunt, sequitur quod influxus inde immediate producat talia, quando temperies adspirat: sunt enim omnia, quae in Mundo spirituali, tam in Coelo quam in Inferno, apparent, correspondentiae affectionum et cupiditatum, nam ibi secundum illas existunt; quare cum affectiones ac cupiditates, quae in se spirituales sunt, offendunt homogenea seu correspondentia in terris, adest spirituale quod dat animam, et materiale quod dat corpus: inest etiam omni spirituali conatus induendi se corpore. Quod Inferna sint circum hominem, et inde contigua terris, est quia Mundus spiritualis non est in spatio, sed est ubi affectio correspondens. </p>
