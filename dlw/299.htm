<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第299节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>299、由于爱、智慧和功用这三者都在主里面，且就是主，还由于主无处不在，因为祂是全在，祂无法将诸如在自己和自己的太阳里面的那个祂自己显示给任何天使或世人，所以祂通过诸如能被接受的那类物事显示祂自己，就是通过热显示祂的爱，通过光显示祂的智慧，通过大气显示祂的功用。主之所以通过大气显示祂的功用，是因为大气是包含热和光的媒介，正如功用是包含爱和智慧的媒介。事实上，从神性太阳发出的光和热不可能在无，也就是真空中发出，而必须在一个作为其容器的包含媒介中发出。我们将这种包含的媒介称作大气，这大气围绕太阳，把它揽在怀里，并将它传送给天使所在的天堂，然后传送给世人所在的世界，从而显示主无处不在。</p>

<p>
299. Bear in mind, then, that these three elements--love, wisdom, and service--are in the Lord and are the Lord. Bear in mind also that the Lord is everywhere, is in fact omnipresent. Then consider that the Lord cannot make himself manifest to any angel or to us as he really is and as he is in his sun. This is why he makes himself manifest by means of things that can be accepted, doing so as to love in the form of warmth, as to wisdom in the form of light, and as to service in the form of an atmosphere.<p>The reason the Lord manifests himself as to service in the form of an atmosphere is that an atmosphere serves as a vessel for warmth and light the way service serves as a vessel for love and wisdom. The warmth and light that radiate from Divinity as the sun cannot radiate in nothing, in a vacuum, but need some vessel as their medium. We call this vessel the atmosphere that surrounds the sun, takes it in its embrace, and carries it to the heaven where angels are and from there to the world where we are. This is how the Lord's presence is made manifest everywhere. </p>

299. Now because these three elements - love, wisdom and useful endeavor - are in the Lord and are the Lord, and because the Lord is everywhere, seeing that He is omnipresent, and because He cannot manifest Himself in person to any angel or person as He is in Himself and as He is in His sun, therefore He manifests Himself by such things as can be received, manifesting Himself as to love by warmth, as to wisdom by light, and as to useful endeavor by the atmosphere.<p>The reason the Lord manifests Himself as to useful endeavor by the atmosphere is that the atmosphere is the containing medium of heat and light, as useful endeavor is the containing medium of love and wisdom. For the light and heat which emanate from the Divine sun cannot emanate in nothing, that is, in a vacuum, but must do so in a containing medium as their vessel; and we call this containing medium the atmosphere which encompasses the sun, which takes that sun in its bosom and conveys it to the heaven where angels dwell and so to the world where people dwell, thus manifesting the Lord's presence everywhere. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #299 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
299. Now because these three, love, wisdom and use are in the Lord, and are the Lord, and because the Lord is everywhere for He is Omnipresent, and because the Lord cannot present Himself such as He is in Himself, and such as He is in His own Sun, to any angel or man, He therefore presents Himself by means of such things as can be received, and does so as to love, by heat, as to wisdom by light, and as to use, by the atmosphere. The Lord manifests Himself as to use by the atmosphere, because the atmosphere is the containant of heat and light, as use is the containant of love and wisdom. For light and heat which go forth from the Divine Sun cannot go forth into nothing, that is into a vacuum, but go forth into a containant which is a subject. And this containant we call the atmosphere, which encompasses the Sun, and receives the sun in its bosom, bearing it to the heavens where the angels are, and thence to the world where men are, thus making manifest the Lord's presence everywhere. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #299 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
299. Now since these three, love, wisdom, and use, are in the Lord, and are the Lord; and since the Lord is everywhere, for He is omnipresent; and since the Lord cannot make Himself present, such as He is in Himself and such as He is in His own sun, to any angel or man, He therefore presents Himself by means of such things as can be received, presenting Himself, as to love by heat, as to wisdom by light, and as to use by an atmosphere. The Lord presents Himself as to use by an atmosphere, because an atmosphere is a containant of heat and light, as use is the containant of love and wisdom. For light and heat going forth from the Divine Sun cannot go forth in nothing, that is, in vacuum, but must go forth in a containant which is a subject. This containant we call an atmosphere; and this encompasses the sun, receiving the sun in its bosom, and bearing it to heaven where angels are, and then to the world where men are, thus making the Lord's presence everywhere manifest. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #299 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
299. Nunc quia haec tria, Amor, Sapientia et Usus, in Domino sunt, et sunt Dominus, et quia Dominus est ubivis, est enim omnipraesens; et quia Dominus non potest Se, qualis est in Se, ac qualis est in suo Sole, praesentem sistere alicui angelo et homini, ideo se sistit per talia quae recipi possunt, et se sistit quoad Amorem per Calorem, quoad Sapientiam per Lucem, et quoad Usum per Athmosphaeram. Quod Dominus se quoad Usum sistat per Athmosphaeram, est quia Athmosphaera est continens caloris et lucis, sicut usus est continens amoris et sapientiae: Lux enim et Calor quae procedunt a Divino Sole, non possunt in nihilo, ita non in vacuo procedere, sed in continente quod subjectum; et hoc continens vocamus Athmosphaeram, quae ambit Solem, et excipit illum in sinu suo, et transfert ad coelum ubi sunt Angeli, et inde ad Mundum ubi sunt homines, et sic sistit praesentiam Domini ubivis. </p>
