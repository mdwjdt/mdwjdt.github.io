<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第102节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>102、下文我们还将看到，灵界太阳的热与光所产生的一切属灵事物就其本身而言，都以同样的方式构成一体；但就从天使的情感发出而言，它们并未构成一体。当热与光在天堂构成一体时，对天使来说，气候就像春天；当它们没有构成一体时，气候要么像夏天，要么像冬天：不是像寒带的冬天，而是像温暖地带的冬天。事实上，对爱与智慧的均等接受是最佳的天使状态；因此，天使照着他里面爱与智慧的合一而为天使。当爱与智慧，或说仁与信在教会之人里面构成一体时，他也一样。</p>

<p>
102. We will see later [<a href="124.htm" target=_top>124</a>] that in their own right, all the spiritual phenomena that stem from the warmth and light of their sun constitute a single whole in the same way, though they do not do so if we regard them as coming from the feelings that angels have. When the warmth and light are a single whole in the heavens, it is like springtime for angels. When they are not a single whole, it is like either summer or winter--not like winter in cold latitudes but like winter in warm latitudes. The essence of angelic nature is a balanced acceptance of love and wisdom, so angels are angels of heaven depending on the oneness of their love and wisdom. The same holds true for us of the church, if our love and wisdom, or charity and faith, are fully united. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #102 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
102. All spiritual creations arising in consequence of the heat and light of their sun are, viewed in themselves, likewise one, but viewed as emanations from the affections of angels, they are not one, as will be seen in subsequent discussions.<p>When heat and light are united in heaven, the climate to angels is like that in springtime. But when they are not united, the climate is either like that in summer, or like that in winter, though not like winter in the colder zones, but like winter in the warmer zones. For the reception of love and wisdom in equal measure is the essence of what it is to be an angel, and an angel is an angel therefore according to the union of love and wisdom in him.<p>It is the same with a person in the church, if the love and wisdom in him, or charity and faith, are united. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #102 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
102. It will be seen in what follows also that all spiritual things originating through the heat and light of their Sun similarly make one when viewed in themselves, but when regarded as proceeding from the affections of the angels they do not make one. When heat and light make one in the heavens it is with the angels as if it were spring. But when they do not make one it is either like summer or like winter-not like winter in frigid zones but like winter in torrid zones, for the reception of love and wisdom in equal proportion is the very angelic state. Wherefore an angel is an angel of heaven in accordance with the union of love and wisdom in him. It is the same with the man of the Church, if love and wisdom, or charity and faith make one in him. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #102 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
102. In what follows it will be seen, also, that all spiritual things that originate through the heat and light of their sun, make one in like manner when regarded in themselves, but when regarded as proceeding from the affections of the angels do not make one. When heat and light make one in the heavens, it is with the angels as if it were spring; but when they do not make one, it is either like summer or like winter - not like the winter in the frigid zones, but like the winter in the warmer zone. Thus reception of love and wisdom in equal measure is the very angelic state, and therefore an angel is an angel of heaven according to the union in him of love and wisdom. It is the same with the man of the church, when love and wisdom, that is, charity and faith, make one in him. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #102 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
102. Quod etiam omnia spiritualia oriunda per calorem et lucem sui Solis, in se spectata similiter unum faciant, at quod illa spectata ut procedentia ex affectionibus Angelorum, non faciant unum, videbitur in sequentibus: quando calor et lux unum faciunt in Coelis, est quasi vernum apud Angelos; quando autem non unum faciunt, est vel sicut aestivum, vel sicut brumale, non sicut brumale in Zonis <sup>1</sup>
frigidis, sed sicut brumale in Zonis calidis; receptio enim amoris et sapientiae ex aequo, est ipsum angelicum, quare angelus est angelus coeli secundum unionem amoris et sapientiae apud illum. Simile est cum homine Ecclesiae, si apud illum amor et sapientia, seu charitas et fides, unum faciunt. <p>
