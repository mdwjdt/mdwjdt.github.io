<h4 align="center"></h4><p>125、由于方位是天使对爱与智慧的各种不同程度的接受，所以有必要说一说产生这种表象的不同。如前所示，主在天使里面，天使在主里面。但由于显为太阳的主看似与天使相距甚远，故还有这样的表象：主从那太阳中看天使，天使则看主在太阳中。这几乎就像镜中观像。所以根据这表象来说的话，情况如下：主面对面地看见并注视每一位天使；但反过来天使却不这样看见并注视主。那些从主处于对主之爱的人看主在正前方，故他们在东西一线。而那些更多地处于智慧的人看主偏向右方，那些更少地处于智慧的人看主偏向左方，故前者在南方，后者在北方。<br><br>后一种人看主的角度之所以有所偏离，是因为爱与智慧虽作为一体从主发出，但却没有作为一体被天使接受，如前所述；超出爱的智慧看似智慧，其实不是，因为超出爱的智慧没有来自爱的任何生命。由此明显可知，造成天使居所看似在灵界不同方位的这种接受的多样性从何而来。</p>

<p>
125. Since the regions are variations in the way angels accept love and wisdom, I need to say something about the variety that gives rise to the appearance.<p>As I explained in the preceding section, the Lord is in each angel, and each angel is in the Lord. However, since it looks as though the Lord as the sun were outside angels, it also looks as though the Lord is seeing them from the sun and that they are seeing the Lord in the sun. This is much like seeing an image in a mirror. So if we talk on the basis of the way things seem, that is how it is. The Lord sees and examines angels face to face, but angels do not see the Lord in the same way. When they are engaged in the love for him that comes from him, they do see him straight ahead, so they are in the east or the west. When they are more engaged in wisdom, though, they see the Lord off to the right, and when they are less engaged in wisdom they see him off to the left, so they are respectively in the north or the south.<p>The reason they have an oblique view is that love and wisdom emanate from the Lord as a single whole, but they are not accepted that way by angels, as I have already noted [<a href="99.htm" target=_top>99</a>]. Any wisdom that goes beyond love may look like wisdom, but it is not, since there is no life from love in that excess wisdom.<p>We can see from this where the differences in receptivity come from, the differences that cause the appearance that angels live in the different regions in the spiritual world. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #125 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>125. Because the zones are reflections of the angels' differing degrees of reception of love and wisdom, something must be said about the differences which produce that appearance.<p>The Lord is in an angel, and an angel in the Lord, as we showed in a previous discussion. <sup>1</sup>
But because the Lord as the sun appears to be at a distance from the angel, it appears as well that the Lord sees him from the sun, and that he sees the Lord in the sun, almost as in the case of an image seen in a mirror.<p>Consequently if we are to speak in terms of that appearance, then the case is as follows, that the Lord sees and gazes upon every angel as being directly before Him, but that the angels do not thus see and gaze upon the Lord in return. Those who are in a state of love toward the Lord from the Lord see Him straight ahead of them. Therefore they are in the east and west. But those who are more in a state of wisdom see the Lord off to the right, and those who are not so much in a state of wisdom off to the left. Therefore they are respectively in the north and south.<p> </p>
<p>[2] The latter see the Lord at an angle to one side for the reason that love and wisdom emanate from the Lord conjointly, but they are not received conjointly by the angels, as we also said above; <sup>2</sup>
and wisdom that outpaces love appears indeed to be wisdom, but still it is not, because wisdom outpacing love does not have in it any life from love.<p>This makes apparent the reason for the diversity of reception which causes the abodes of angels to appear in different zones in the spiritual world.<p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #125 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>125. Because the quarters are varying receptions of love and wisdom by the angels, the variety from which that appearance comes into being will be stated. The Lord is in the angel and the angel in the Lord, as was shown in a previous section. But because it appears as if the Lord as a Sun is outside the angel, it also appears that the Lord sees him from the Sun and that he sees the Lord in the Sun, and this is almost as an image appears in a mirror. Wherefore if we speak from that appearance then the case is this, that the Lord sees and looks upon each one face to face, but that the angels on the other hand, do not thus see the Lord. Those who are in love to the Lord from the Lord see Him directly, therefore such are in the east and west. But those who are more in wisdom see the Lord indirectly to the right, and those who are less in wisdom indirectly to the left. Therefore the former are in the south and the latter in the north. The reason these have an indirect view is because love and wisdom proceed from the Lord as one but, as said above, are not received as one by the angels. And the wisdom which prevails over the love indeed appears as wisdom but yet is not, because in the superabundance of wisdom there is no life from love in it. From the foregoing it is clear whence comes the diversity of reception according to which the angels' dwellings appear relative to quarters in the spiritual world. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #125 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
125. As the quarters are various receptions of love and wisdom by angels, the variety from which that appearance springs shall now be explained. The Lord is in the angel, and the angel in the Lord (as was shown in a preceding article). But on account of the appearance that the Lord as a sun is outside of the angel, there is also the appearance that the Lord sees him from the sun, and that he sees the Lord in the sun. This is almost like the appearance of an image in a mirror. Speaking, therefore, according to that appearance, it may be said that the Lord sees and looks at each one face to face, but that angels, on their part, do not thus behold the Lord. Those who are in love to the Lord from the Lord see Him directly in front; these, therefore, are in the east and the west; but those who are more in wisdom see the Lord obliquely to the right, and those who are less in wisdom obliquely to the left; therefore the former are in the south, and the latter in the north. The view of these is oblique because love and wisdom (as has been said before), although they proceed from the Lord as one, are not received as one by angels; and the wisdom which is in excess of the love, while it appears as wisdom, is not wisdom, because in the overplus of wisdom there is no life from love. From all this it is evident whence comes the diversity of reception according to which angels appear to dwell according to quarters in the spiritual world. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #125 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>125. Quia Plagae sunt variae Receptiones amoris et sapientiae ab angelis, dicetur de varietate, ex qua apparentia illa existit. Dominus est in angelo et angelus in Domino, ut in Articulo praecedente ostensum est; sed quia apparet sicut Dominus ut Sol sit extra illum, apparet etiam quod Dominus videat illum e Sole, et quod ille videat Dominum in Sole, quod est paene sicut imago apparet in speculo: quare si ex apparentia illa loquendum sit, tunc res talis est, <sup>1</sup>
quod Dominus videat et inspiciat unumquemvis facie ad faciem, sed quod vicissim angeli non ita Dominum; illi qui in amore in Dominum a Domino sunt, vident Ipsum directe[;] ideo illi sunt in Oriente et Occidente; illi autem qui plus in sapientia sunt, vident Dominum oblique ad dextrum, et qui minus in sapientia sunt, oblique ad sinistrum; ideo hi et illi sunt in septentrione et meridie.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Quod hi in obliquo aspectu sint, est quia amor et sapientia ut unum procedunt a Domino, sed non ut unum recipiuntur ab Angelis, ut quoque prius dictum est, et sapientia, quae abundat super amorem, apparet quidem ut sapientia, sed usque non est, quia superabundanti sapientiae non inest vita ex amore. Ex his patet, unde est diversitas receptionis, juxta quam habitationes Angelorum secundum Plagas in Mundo spirituali apparent. <p>
