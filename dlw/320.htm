<h4 align="center"></h4><p>320、尽管如此，人是一个小世界或小宇宙，因为从功用的角度来看，受造宇宙是一个人的形像，这一真理无法按灵界看待宇宙的观念进入任何世人的思维，并由此进入他的知识。因此，只有在灵界的天使，或被恩准进入灵界，得以看见那里的事物的某个人，才能证实这一点。我因有此恩典，故能通过我在那里所看见的事物揭示这个奥秘。</p>

320. We are a microcosm or little universe because the created universe has a human image if it is seen in terms of functions. However, this notion remains outside the scope of the thinking we do on the basis of the universe as we see it in this physical world and outside the scope of the knowledge that derives from that thinking. This means that the only way this thought can be established is by an angel who is in the spiritual world or by someone who has been granted entry into that world to see what is there. Since this has been granted to me, I can unveil this mystery from what I have seen there. </p>

320. Still, the notion that the human being is a microcosm or little universe - because regarded in terms of its uses, the created universe is, in an image, a human entity - is not something that can enter anyone's thinking and consequent knowledge from an idea of the universe as it is viewed in the spiritual world. Neither can it be attested, therefore, except by an angel who lives in the spiritual world, or by one to whom it has been granted to be in that world and to see the phenomena that exist there. Because this has been granted to me, I can reveal this secret from the phenomena I have seen in that world. </p>

320. But it cannot enter the thought and so come to the knowledge of anyone from the idea of the universe as seen in the spiritual world that man is a microcosm or little universe, because the created universe, viewed as to uses, is in image a man. Therefore this can be confirmed only by an angel who is in the spiritual world, or by some one to whom it has been granted to be in that world, and to see the things which are there. Because this has been granted to me, I am able, from the things I have seen there, to reveal this arcanum. </p>

<p>
320. But the truth that man is a microcosm, or little universe, because the created universe, viewed as to uses is, in image, a man, cannot come into the thought and from that into the knowledge of any one on earth from the idea of the universe as it is viewed in the spiritual world; and therefore it can be corroborated only by an angel, who is in the spiritual world, or by some one to whom it has been granted to be in that world, and to see things which are there. As this has been granted to me, I am able, from what I have seen there, to disclose this arcanum. </p>

320. Quod autem homo sit Microcosmus seu parvum Universum, ex eo quod universum creatum quoad usus spectatum sit in imagine Homo, non potest venire in alicujus cogitationem et inde scientiam ex idea Universi spectati in Mundo spirituali; quare hoc non potest confirmari, nisi quam ab Angelo qui in Mundo spirituali est, vel ab aliquo cui datum est in illo Mundo esse, et videre illa quae ibi sunt; hoc quia mihi datum est, possum ex visis ibi hoc arcanum revelare. </p>
