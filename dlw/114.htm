<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第114节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>114、主不仅在天堂，而且就是天堂本身。因为构成天使的是爱与智慧，这二者属于天使里面的主；由此可推知，主就是天堂。因为天使之为天使，不是凭他们的自我；他们的自我和世人的一样，也是邪恶。一位天使的自我之所以是邪恶，是因为所有天使都曾为人，这种自我是天使与生俱来的。它只是被移走，并且它被移走到何等程度，天使就在何等程度上将爱与智慧，也就是主接入自己里面。只要稍稍提升自己的理解力，谁都能看出，主能住在天使里面，但只能住在祂的东西里面，也就是住在祂自己的固有本性，即爱与智慧里面，根本不可能住在天使的自我，也就是邪恶里面。正因如此，邪恶被移走到何等程度，主就在何等程度上住在他们里面，他们便在何等程度上成为天使。天堂天使的品质就是神性之爱与神性智慧。当神性存在于天使里面时，这神性就被称为天使的。由此明显可知，天使之为天使是凭主，而不是凭他们自己。因此，这也适用于天堂。</p>

114. The reason the Lord is not only in heaven but actually is heaven itself is that love and wisdom make an angel, and these two are properties of the Lord in the angels. It therefore follows that the Lord is heaven.<p>Angels are not angels because of anything that belongs to them. What belongs to them is just like what belongs to us--evil. The reason this is what belongs to angels is that all angels were once earthly people, and this attribute clings to them from their birth. It is simply moved aside, and to the extent that it is, they accept love and wisdom, or the Lord, into themselves.<p>With a little elevation of understanding, everyone can see that it is quite impossible for the Lord to dwell with angels in anything but what is his, that is, what belongs to him, which is love and wisdom. He cannot dwell in anything that belongs to the angels, which is evil. This is why the Lord is in them, and they are angels, to the extent that evil is moved aside. The actual angelic essence of heaven is divine love and wisdom. This divine reality is called "angelic" when it is in angels; so again we can see that angels are angels because of the Lord and not on their own. The same therefore holds true for heaven as well. </p>

114. The Lord not only is present in heaven, but He also is heaven itself. That is because love and wisdom are what make an angel, and these two properties are the Lord's in angels. It follows therefore that the Lord is heaven.<p>The fact is that angels are not angels in consequence of their native character. Their native character is altogether like that of any person, which is evil. This is the native character of angels because all angels were once people, and this native character remains in them from birth. It is only set aside, and to the extent it is set aside, to that extent they receive into them love and wisdom, which is to say, the Lord.<p>If anyone simply raises his understanding to some degree, he can see that the Lord can dwell only in what is His in angels, that is, in His own inherent character, which is love and wisdom, and cannot dwell at all in the native character of angels, which is evil. So it is that to the extent evil is set aside, to that extent the Lord is present in them, and to that extent they are angels. The very angelic quality of heaven is Divine love and wisdom. This Divine quality is called angelic when it exists in angels. Thus it is again apparent that angels are angels owing to the Lord and not to themselves. Consequently the same may be said of heaven. </p>

<p>
114. Not only is the Lord in heaven but He also is heaven itself, because love and wisdom make the angel, and these two with angels are the Lord's. Hence it follows that the Lord is heaven. For angels are not angels from their proprium. <sup>1</sup>
Their proprium is exactly like that of a man and this is evil. That an angel's proprium is such is because all angels have been men, and that proprium adheres to them from birth. It is only removed, and to the extent that it is removed, to that extent they receive love and wisdom, that is, the Lord in themselves. Anyone can see if only he will raise his understanding a little that the Lord can dwell with angels only in what is His, that is, in what is His Very Own, which is Love and Wisdom, and certainly not in the angels' proprium which is evil. Hence it is that so far as evil is removed, so far the Lord is in them, and so far they are angels. The very angelic itself of heaven is the Divine Love and Wisdom. This Divine is called the angelic when it is in angels. From this again it is clear that angels are angels from the Lord, and not from themselves; consequently, the same is true regarding heaven. <p>

1.&nbsp;The Latin word proprium means what is one's own. Swedenborg uses it in a special sense involving "what is of the self." </p>

114. The Lord not only is in heaven, but also is heaven itself; for love and wisdom are what make the angel, and these two are the Lord's in the angels; from which it follows that the Lord is heaven. For angels are not angels from what is their own; what is their own is altogether like what is man's own, which is evil. An angel's own is such because all angels were once men, and this own clings to the angels from their birth. It is only put aside, and so far as it is put aside the angels receive love and wisdom, that is, the Lord, in themselves. Any one, if he will only elevate his understanding a little, can see that the Lord can dwell in angels, only in what is His, that is, in what is His very own, which is love and wisdom, and not at all in the selfhood of angels, which is evil. From this it is, that so far as evil is put away so far the Lord is in them, and so far they are angels. The very angelic of heaven is Love Divine and Wisdom Divine. This Divine is called the angelic when it is in angels. From this, again, it is evident that angels are angels from the Lord, and not from themselves; consequently, the same is true of heaven. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #114 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
114. Quod Dominus non modo sit in Coelo, sed etiam quod sit ipsum Coelum, est quia amor et sapientia faciunt Angelum, et illa duo sunt Domini apud angelos; inde sequitur, quod Dominus sit Coelum. Angeli enim non sunt Angeli a proprio illorum; proprium illorum est prorsus sicut proprium hominis, quod est malum; quod hoc sit proprium angelorum, est quia omnes Angeli fuerunt homines, et id proprium a nativitate illis inhaeret; removetur modo, et quantum id removetur, tantum recipiunt amorem et sapientiam, hoc est, Dominum in se. Quisque potest videre, si modo aliquantum elevat intellectum, quod Dominus non possit habitare nisi quam in suo apud angelos, hoc est, in proprio suo, quod est Amor et Sapientia, et prorsus non in proprio angelorum, quod est malum; inde est, quod quantum removetur malum, tantum Dominus sit in illis, et tantum illi sint angeli; ipsum angelicum Coeli est Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia; hoc Divinum vocatur Angelicum dum est in angelis; inde iterum patet, quod Angeli sint Angeli a Domino, et non a semet; consequenter etiam Coelum. </p>
