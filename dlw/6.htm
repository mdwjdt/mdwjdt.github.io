<h4 align="center"></h4><p>6、既然人不是生命，而是生命的接受者，那么可知，人从父亲成孕不是生命的成孕，只是能够接受生命的最初和最纯形式的成孕；物质材料以适合接受在其秩序和层级中的生命的形式陆续添加到这最初形式，如在子宫里的初始细胞核上。</p>

6. Since we are life-receivers, not life, it follows that our conception from our parents is not the conception of life but simply the conception of the first and purest forms that can accept life. These forms serve as a nucleus or beginning in the womb, to which are added, step by step, material substances in forms suited, in their various patterns and levels, to the reception of life. </p>

<p>
6. Since people are not life but recipients of life, it follows then that the procreation of a person by his father is not a procreation of life, but only a procreation of the first and purest form receptive of life, to which, as the germinal or initial element, are progressively added in the womb substances and materials suited in their forms for the reception of life in its order and development. </p>

<p>
6. Since therefore man is not life, but is a recipient of life, it follows that the conception of a man from his father is not the conception of life, but only a conception of the first and purest forms capable of receiving life, to which, as to a nucleus of initiament in the womb, there successively accrue substances and matters in forms adapted to the reception of life in its order and degree. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #6 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
6. Since, then, man is not life, but is a recipient of life, it follows that the conception of a man from his father is not a conception of life, but only a conception of the first and purest form capable of receiving life; and to this, as to a nucleus or starting-point in the womb, are successively added substances and matters in forms adapted to the reception of life, in their order and degree.  </p>

<p>
6. Cum itaque homo non est vita sed recipiens vitae, sequitur quod conceptio hominis a patre non sit conceptio vitae, sed modo conceptio primae et purissimae formae receptibilis vitae, cui ut stamini aut initiamento in utero successive accedunt substantiae et materiae in formis ad receptionem vitae in suo ordine et in suo gradu adaptatae. </p>
