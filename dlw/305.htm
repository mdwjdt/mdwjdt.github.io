<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">4.6 形成大地的物质和材料没有丝毫神性本身的东西在里面，但它们依然起源于神性本身</h4><p>305、从前面所论述的大地起源可以看出，它们的物质和材料没有丝毫神性本身的东西在里面，而是缺乏系神性本身的一切。因为如前所述，它们是大气的最终和末端形式，其热消失于寒冷，其光消失于黑暗，其活性消失于惰性。然而，因着它们从灵界太阳的演变，它们仍保留了来自那里的神性，也就是围绕神-人或主的气场的那种物质(如前所述，291-298节)。从这个气场，通过从灵界太阳经由作为媒介的大气的演变，便产生了形成大地的物质和材料。</p>

305. There is nothing of absolute Divinity in the material substances that make up earth, but they are still derived from absolute Divinity. On the basis of the origin of earth as described in the preceding section, we may conclude that there is no trace of absolute Divinity in the earth's material substances; they are completely devoid of absolute Divinity. There are, as already stated [<a href="184.htm" target=_top>184</a>, <a href="189.htm" target=_top>189</a>], boundaries and limits of the atmospheres, whose warmth lapses into cold, light into darkness, and activity into torpor. Still, by being connected with their source, the substance of the spiritual sun, they retain something that is in that sun from Divinity. As noted above in <a href="291.htm" target=_top>291-298</a> [<a href="291.htm" target=_top>291-294</a>], this was the aura that envelops the Divine-Human One, the Lord. The material substances of earth arise from this aura by extension from the sun, by means of the atmospheres. </p>

305. The substances and materials of which the earth consists have in them nothing of the Divine in itself, but still they originate from that which is Divine in itself. From the origin of the earth, as discussed under the previous heading, it can be seen that its substances and materials have in them nothing of the Divine in itself, but that they are bereft of everything that is Divine in itself. For as we said, they are the final and terminal forms of the atmospheres, whose warmth ends in coldness, whose light ends in darkness, and whose activity ends in inertness. But still, by their evolution from the substance of the spiritual sun, they have retained that which was from the Divine there, which, as we said in nos. <a href="291.htm">291-293</a> above, was the atmosphere surrounding the human God or the Lord. From that atmosphere, by their evolution from the sun by means of the succeeding atmospheres, have arisen the substances and materials of which the earth consists. </p>

305. IN THE SUBSTANCES AND MATTERS OUT OF WHICH THE EARTH IS FORMED, THERE IS NOTHING OF THE DIVINE IN ITSELF, BUT YET THEY ARE FROM THE DIVINE IN ITSELF <p>From the origin of the earth as treated in the preceding section, it can be confirmed that, in its substances and matters, there is nothing of the Divine in itself, but that they are devoid of all that is Divine in itself. For they are, as was said, the endings and terminations of the atmospheres whose heat has ended in cold, light in darkness and activity in inertia. But yet they have brought with them by continuation from the substance of the spiritual Sun, that which was there from the Divine which, as said above (<a href="291.htm">291-298</a>) was a sphere encompassing God-Man, or the Lord. From this sphere, by continuation from the Sun by means of the atmospheres, have arisen the substances and matters from which the earth is formed. </p>

305. IN THE SUBSTANCES AND MATTERS OF WHICH LANDS ARE FORMED THERE IS NOTHING OF THE DIVINE IN ITSELF, BUT STILL THEY ARE FROM THE DIVINE IN ITSELF. <p>From the origin of lands (treated of in the preceding chapter), it can be seen, that in their substances and matters there is nothing of the Divine in itself, but that they are devoid of all-that is Divine in itself. For they are, as was said, the endings and closings of the atmospheres, whose heat has died away into cold, whose light into darkness, and whose activity into inertness. Nevertheless, by continuation from the substance of the spiritual sun, they have brought with them what there was in that substance from the Divine, which (as said above, n. <a href="291.htm" target=_top>291-298</a>), was the sphere encompassing God-Man, or the Lord. From that sphere, by continuation from the sun through the atmospheres as mediums have arisen the substances and matters of which the lands are formed. </p>

305. QUOD IN SUBSTANTIIS ET MATERIIS, EX QUIBUS SUNT TERRAE, NIHIL DIVINI IN SE SIT, SED QUOD USQUE ILLAE SINT A DIVINO IN SE. Ex origine terrarum, de qua in praecedente Articulo, constare potest, quod in substantiis et materiis illarum, nihil Divini in se sit, sed quod omni Divino in se orbatae sint; sunt enim, ut dictum est, fines et terminationes Athmosphaerarum, quarum calor desiit in frigus, lux in caliginem, et activitas in inertiam; sed usque tulerunt per continuationem ex substantia Solis Spiritualis id quod ibi a Divino fuit, quod ut supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_305/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_291" target=_top>291-293</a> <sup>1</sup>
dictum est, fuit sphaera ambiens Deum Hominem seu Dominum; ex hac sphaera per continuationem a Sole mediis Athmosphaeris ortae sunt substantiae et materiae e quibus terrae. <p>
