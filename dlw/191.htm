<h4 align="center"></h4><p>191、从这些例子可对那些眼所看不见的事物形成一个结论，因为它们的情况是一样的；如大脑中作为思维和情感之容器和居所的有机物质是这样；大气、热与光，以及爱与智慧也是这样。因为大气是热与光的容器，热和光则是爱和智慧的容器。因此，大气既有层级之分，那么热与光，以及爱与智慧也有同样的层级之分。因为相同的原理如同适用于前者那样适用于后者。</p>

<p>
191. On this basis we can draw conclusions about things not visible to our eyes, since their arrangement is similar--for example about the organized substances that are the vessels and dwellings of the thoughts and feelings in our brains, about the atmospheres, about warmth and light, and about love and wisdom. The atmospheres are vessels of warmth and light, and warmth and light are vessels of love and wisdom. So if there are levels of the atmospheres, then there are similar levels of warmth and light and similar levels of love and wisdom. There is not one set of relationships in one case and a different set in another. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #191 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
191. From these illustrations one may draw conclusions in regard to such things as are not visible to the eyes, because the case is the same with them. It is the same, for example, with the organic substances which constitute the vessels and seats of thoughts and affections in the brain. It is the same with the atmospheres, with heat and light, and with love and wisdom. For the atmospheres are vehicles of heat and light, and heat and light are vehicles of love and wisdom. Consequently, as there are degrees of atmospheres, there are also like degrees of heat and light, and like degrees of love and wisdom. For the relationship between the latter degrees is the same as that between the former. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #191 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
191. From these examples a conclusion may be formed regarding those things which do not appear before the eyes, because with these the case is the same. Thus it is the same with organic substances which are the receptacles and abodes of thoughts and affections in the brains. It is the same with the atmospheres, with heat and light, and with love and wisdom. For atmospheres are receptacles of heat and light, and heat and light are receptacles of love and wisdom. Wherefore since there are degrees of atmospheres, there are also like degrees of heat and light, and of love and wisdom. For the principle is the same with the latter as with the former. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #191 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
191. From these examples a conclusion may be formed respecting those things that are not visible to the eye, for with those it is the same; for example, with the organic substances which are the receptacles and abodes of thoughts and affections in the brains; with atmospheres; with heat and light; and with love and wisdom. For atmospheres are receptacles of heat and light; and heat and light are receptacles of love and wisdom; consequently, as there are degrees of atmospheres, there are also like degrees of heat and light, and of love and wisdom; for the same principle applies to the latter as to the former. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #191 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
191. Ex his concludi potest ad illa, quae coram oculis non apparent, quia similis res cum his est: ut cum substantiis organicis, quae sunt receptacula et habitacula cogitationum et affectionum in Cerebris; cum Athmosphaeris; cum Calore et Luce; et cum Amore et Sapientia. Athmosphaerae enim sunt receptacula caloris et lucis; ac Calor et Lux sunt receptacula amoris et sapientiae; quare cum Athmosphaerarum gradus sunt, etiam similes Gradus sunt Caloris et Lucis, et similes Amoris et Sapientiae; non enim alia ratio horum est quam illarum. </p>
