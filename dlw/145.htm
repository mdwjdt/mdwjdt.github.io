<h4 align="center"></h4><p>145、在灵界也会看到各种路，铺砌得就像自然界的路。有的通向天堂，有的通向地狱。但上天堂的灵人看不见通向地狱的路，下地狱的灵人看不见通向天堂的路。像这样的路数不胜数，因为它们通向天堂的一切社群和地狱的一切社群。每个灵人都会踏上通向自己爱的社群之路，看不见其它方向的路。正因如此，随着每个灵人转向自己的主导爱，他也会朝它前行。</p>

<p>
145. In the spiritual world, you can see roads laid out like roads in our physical world. Some of them lead to heaven and some to hell. The roads that lead to hell are not visible to people who are going to heaven, and the roads that lead to heaven are not visible to people who are going to hell. There are more such roads than you can count, roads leading to each heavenly community and to each hellish community. Each individual spirit sets out on the road that leads to the community of his or her own love and does not even see the roads that lead in other directions. As a result, when spirits turn toward their ruling love, they also travel. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #145 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
145. The spiritual world has roads appearing in it, paved like roads in the natural world. Some lead to heaven, and some to hell. The roads which lead to hell are not visible, however, to spirits who are going to heaven, nor are the roads which lead to heaven visible to spirits who are going to hell. There are roads like this beyond number, for they go to every society in heaven and to every society in hell. Every spirit enters upon the way which leads to the society where his love is, nor does he see any paths leading elsewhere.<p>It is for this reason that as every spirit turns to his dominant love, he also proceeds toward it. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #145 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
145. In the spiritual world there appear roads laid out like roads in the natural world. Some lead to heaven and some to hell. But the roads which lead to hell are not visible to those who are going to heaven, nor are the roads which lead to heaven visible to those who are going to hell. Roads of this kind are innumerable, for there are some which bend towards every society of heaven and every society of hell. Each spirit enters the road which leads towards the society of his own love, and he does not see the roads stretching in any other direction. Hence it is that each spirit, as he turns towards his ruling love, goes forward thereon. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #145 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
145. In the spiritual world ways are seen, laid out like ways in the natural world; some leading to heaven, and some to hell; but the ways leading to hell are not visible to those going to heaven, nor are the ways leading to heaven visible to those going to hell. There are countless ways of this kind; for there are ways which lead to every society of heaven and to every society of hell. Each spirit enters the way which leads to the society of his own love, nor does he see the ways leading in other directions. Thus it is that each spirit, as he turns himself to his ruling love, goes forward in it. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #145 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
145. In Mundo spirituali apparent viae, stratae sicut viae in Mundo naturali[;] quaedam ducunt ad Coelum, et quaedam ad Infernum; sed viae, quae ducunt ad Infernum non apparent illis qui ad Coelum eunt, nec viae quae ducunt ad Coelum apparent illis qui ad Infernum eunt; sunt innumerae tales viae, sunt enim quae tendunt ad unamquamvis societatem Coeli, et ad unamquamvis societatem Inferni; unusquisque spiritus intrat viam quae ducit ad societatem sui amoris, nec videt vias alio tendentes: inde est, quod unusquisque spiritus, sicut ad amorem suum regnantem se vertit, etiam progrediatur. </p>
