<h4 align="center"></h4><p>345、⑸这一切是由脱离其高层的最低属灵层造成的。第三部分已说明：属灵成分从灵界太阳通过三个层级流下来，直至自然界的最低成分，这三个层级被称为属天层、属灵层和属世层；这三个层级自创造时，因而自出生时就在人里面，它们照着人的生活被打开；如果属天层，也就是最高和最内层被打开，人就变得属天；如果属灵层，也就是中间层被打开，人就变得属灵；但是，如果只有属世层，也就是最低和最外层被打开，人就变得属世。人若变成纯属世的，就只热爱肉体和世俗事物；并且他热爱这些东西到何等程度，就不热爱属天和属灵事物，不仰望主，并变得邪恶到何等程度。由此明显可知，被称为属灵-属世层的最低属灵层，能与它的高层分离，并且在由地狱构成的人里面是分离的。这最低的属灵层本身无法与它的高层分离，并朝地狱的方向观看；它也无法在地上的动物或物质里面如此分离并朝地狱的方向观看；它只能在人里面如此分离。<br><br>由此可知，正是脱离其高层的这最低属灵层，如存在于地狱里的人里面的那种，造成了上述地上的那些恶用。地上的有害物起源于人，因而起源于地狱，这一点可从圣言中所描述的迦南地的状态推断出来。当以色列人照诫命生活时，那地的出产就增多，牛羊群也是。但当他们违背诫命生活时，那地就贫瘠，如圣言所说的，被诅咒了；它产出的不再是庄稼，而是荆棘，他们的牛羊群流产，野兽侵袭。这一点也可从埃及的蝗虫、青蛙和虱子推断出来。</p>

345, 5. The lowest spiritual level, separated from what is higher, is what does this. I explained the following things in part 3. What is spiritual flows from its sun all the way down to the borders of nature by three steps, and these steps are called heavenly, spiritual, and earthly. They are within us from creation and therefore are inherent in us from birth. They are opened in proportion to our lives. If the heavenly level is opened, which is the highest and central one, then we become heavenly. If the spiritual level is opened, which is the intermediate one, then we become spiritual. If only the earthly level, the lowest and most remote, is opened, then we become earthly; and if we become nothing but earthly, we love only what has to do with our bodies and the world. To the extent that this is the case, we do not love things that are heavenly and spiritual and we do not turn toward God; and to that extent we become evil.<p>We can see from this that the lowest spiritual level, called "the spiritual-earthly level," can be separated from what lies above it and that it is so separated in the people who constitute hell. This lowest spiritual level cannot be separated from what lies above it either in animals or in soils and turn toward hell. This can happen only in humans.<p>It therefore follows that when the lowest spiritual level is separated from what lies above it the way it is for people in hell, this is what creates those evil functions on earth that I have just been discussing.<p>As for the claim that the harmful things on earth can be traced back to us and therefore to hell, this is supported by conditions in the land of Canaan described in the Word. When the Israelites lived by the Commandments, the land provided them with food as well as flocks and herds, while when they lived contrary to the Commandments it became barren and cursed, so to speak, bringing forth thorns and briars instead of grain. Their flocks and herds miscarried and wild beasts invaded. We can draw the same conclusion from the locusts, frogs, and lice in Egypt. </p>

<p>345. (5) The lowest spiritual plane separated from its higher one occasions this. In Part Three we showed the following: That a spiritual component flows down from its sun through three degrees even to the lowest elements of nature, and that these degrees are called celestial, spiritual and natural. That these three degrees exist in people from creation and so from birth, and are opened in accordance with a person's life. That if the celestial degree is opened, which is the highest or inmost, the person becomes celestial; that if the spiritual degree is opened, which is intermediate, the person becomes spiritual; and that if the natural degree only is opened, which is the lowest or outmost, the person becomes natural. That if a person becomes merely natural, he loves only things connected with his person and the world; and that to the extent he loves these, to the same extent he is averse to celestial and spiritual things, and does not look to God, and to that extent becomes evil.<p>From the foregoing it is apparent that the lowest spiritual plane, which we call spiritually natural, can be separated from its higher ones, and that it is separated in people of whom hell consists.<p>The lowest spiritual plane by itself cannot be separated from its higher ones and look in the direction of hell. Nor can it be separated and look in the direction of hell in animals or substances of the earth. It can be so separated only in people.<p> </p>
<p>[2] It follows from this that it is the lowest spiritual plane separated from its higher one, as it is in people who are in hell, which occasions on the earth those evil forms of use discussed above.<p>That noxious phenomena on the earth take their origin from mankind and so from hell may be concluded from the state of the land of Canaan as described in the Word. When the children of Israel lived in accordance with the commandments, the land yielded its produce, and so did their flocks and herds. But when they lived contrary to the commandments, the land was barren and, as the Word says, cursed. Instead of a harvest it produced thorns and brambles, their flocks and herds miscarried, and wild animals invaded.<p>The same conclusion may be drawn from the locusts, frogs and lice in Egypt. <sup>1</sup>

<p>345. (v) The lowest spiritual separated from what is above brings this about. It was shown in Part III that the spiritual flows down from its sun even to the ultimates of nature through three degrees which are called celestial, spiritual and natural; that these three degrees are in man from creation, consequently from birth; and that they are opened according to his life. It was also shown that if the celestial degree which is the highest and inmost is opened, the man becomes celestial, if the spiritual degree which is the middle is opened, he becomes spiritual, but if only the natural degree which is the lowest and outermost is opened, he becomes natural. If man becomes natural only, he loves only corporeal and worldly things; and so far as he loves them, so far he does not love celestial and spiritual things, and does not look to God, and to that extent becomes evil. From these things it is clear that the lowest spiritual, which is called spiritual-natural, can be separated from its higher parts, and is separated in men from whom hell is formed. The lowest spiritual cannot of itself be separated from its higher parts and look towards hell either in beasts or in earths; it is possible only with men. From which it follows that the lowest spiritual, separated from what is above it, such as it is with those who are in hell, works to effect those evil uses on earth, spoken of above. That noxious things on earth derive their origin from man, and thus from hell, can be confirmed from the condition of the land of Canaan, described in the Word. When the children of Israel lived according to the Commandments, the earth yielded her increase, likewise the flocks and herds; and when they lived contrary to the Commandments, the land was barren and, as it is said, accursed; instead of harvests it yielded thorns and briars; flocks and herds miscarried, and wild beasts broke in. The same may be deduced from the locusts, and lice in Egypt. </p>

345. (5) This is effected by the lowest spiritual separated from what is above it. It was shown in Part Third that the spiritual flows down from its sun even to the outmosts of nature through three degrees, which are called the celestial, the spiritual, and the natural; that these three degrees are in man from creation, consequently from birth; that they are opened according to man's life; that if the celestial degree which is the highest and inmost is opened, man becomes celestial; if the spiritual degree which is the middle is opened, he becomes spiritual; but if only the natural degree which is the lowest and outermost is opened, he becomes natural; that if man becomes natural only, he loves only corporeal and worldly things; and that so far as he loves these, so far he does not love celestial and spiritual things, and does not look to God, and so far he becomes evil. From all this it is evident that the lowest spiritual, which is called the spiritual-natural, can be separated from its higher degrees, and is separated in such men as hell consists of. This lowest spiritual can separate itself from its higher parts, and look to hell, in men only; it cannot be so separated in beasts, or in soils. From which it follows that these evil uses mentioned above are effected on the earth by this lowest spiritual separated from what is above it, such as it is in those who are in hell. That the noxious things on the earth have their origin in man, thus from hell, may be shown by the state of the land of Canaan, as described in the Word; in that when the children of Israel lived according to the commandments, the earth yielded its increase, likewise the flocks and herds; but when they lived contrary to the commandments the ground was barren, and as it is said, accursed; instead of harvests it yielded thorns and briars, the flocks and herds miscarried, and wild beasts broke in. The same may be inferred from the locusts, frogs, and lice in Egypt. </p>

<p>345. V. Quod ultimum spirituale separatum a superiori suo id operetur. In Parte Tertia ostensum est, quod Spirituale a Sole suo usque ad ultima naturae defluat per tres gradus, et quod illi gradus dicantur Coelestis, Spiritualis et Naturalis, et quod in homine a creatione, et inde a nativitate, tres illi gradus insint, et quod aperiantur secundum vitam ejus, et quod si aperitur coelestis gradus, qui est supremus et intimus, homo fiat coelestis; [quod] si gradus spiritualis, qui medius, aperitur, homo fiat spiritualis; et [quod] si modo naturalis gradus, qui est infimus et extremus, aperitur, homo fiat naturalis, et quod si modo fit naturalis, amet solum illa quae corporis et mundi sunt, et quod quantum illa amat, tantum non amet coelestia et spiritualia, et non spectet ad Deum, et quod tantum malus fiat: ex his patet, quod ultimum spirituale, quod vocatur spirituale naturale, separari possit a superioribus suis, et quod hoc separetur apud homines, a quibus Infernum: ultimum spirituale a superioribus suis non potest a se separari, nec apud bestias, nec in terris, et spectare versus infernum, nisi solum apud homines.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Ex his sequitur, quod ultimum spirituale separatum a superiori suo, quale est illis qui in inferno sunt, malos illos usus, de quibus supra, super tellure operetur. Quod noxia super tellure originem ducant ab homine, et sic ex inferno, confirmari potest ex statu terrae Canaanis, de quo in Verbo, quod cum filii Israelis vixerunt secundum praecepta, terrae dederint proventum suum, similiter greges et armenta; et quod cum contra praecepta vixerunt, terrae fuerint steriles, et sicut dicitur[,] maledictae[;] [quod] loco messis dederint spinas et sentes, ac quod abortiverint greges et armenta, et ferae irruperint. Simile potest deduci ex locustis, ranis et pediculis in Aegypto. </p>
