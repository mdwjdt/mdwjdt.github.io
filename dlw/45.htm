<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第45节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>45、凡能运用思维能力理解并领悟存在与显现本身的概念之人，定能理解并领悟它就是那绝对的独一无二者。称它为绝对，因为它是唯一的存在；称它为独一无二，因为它是其它一切事物的源头。由于绝对的独一无二者是物质与形式，故可知，它就是那绝对独一无二的物质与形式。由于这绝对的物质与形式是神性之爱与神性智慧，故可知，它是绝对独一无二的爱与绝对独一无二的智慧；因此，它是绝对独一无二的本质，也是绝对独一无二的生命。因为生命就是爱与智慧。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #45 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
45. Anyone who can pursue and grasp inherent reality and its manifestation at all thoughtfully will necessarily come to grasp the fact that it is wholly itself and unique. We call it wholly itself because it alone exists; and we call it unique because it is the source of everything else.<p>Further, since what is wholly itself and unique is substance and form, it follows that it is the unique substance and form, and wholly itself; and since that true substance and form is divine love and wisdom, it follows that it is the unique love, wholly itself, and the unique wisdom, wholly itself. It is therefore the unique essence, wholly itself, and the unique life, wholly itself, since love and wisdom is life. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #45 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
45. Anyone who can with some thought conceive of and comprehend being and expression in itself must altogether conceive of and comprehend that it is the one and only absolute. The term absolute is used of that which alone is, and the term one and only of that which is the origin of everything else.<p>Now because the one and only absolute is substance and form, it follows that it is the one and only absolute substance and form. And because that absolute substance and form is Divine love and wisdom, it follows that it is the one and only absolute love, and the one and only absolute wisdom; consequently, that it is the one and only absolute essence, and the one and only absolute life. For love and wisdom together are life. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #45 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
45. He who, by some thought, can become accustomed to, and can comprehend [the idea of] Esse and Existere in itself can certainly become accustomed to the idea, and can comprehend that it is the Very and One Only [Reality]; that is called the Very Reality which Alone is, and that it is called the One Only from which every other thing is. Now because the Very and One Only is substance and form, it follows that it is the Very and One Only substance and form. And because this Very substance and form is Divine Love and Wisdom, it follows that it is the Very and Only Love and the Very and Only Wisdom; consequently, that it is the Very and Only Essence, as well as the Very and Only Life, for Life is Love and Wisdom. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #45 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
45. He who by exercise of thought is able to grasp the idea of and to comprehend, Esse and Existere in itself, can certainly perceive and comprehend that it is the Very and the Only. That is called the Very which alone is; and that is called the Only from which every thing else proceeds. Now because the Very and the Only is substance and form, it follows that it is the very and only substance and form. Because this very substance and form is Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, it follows that it is the very and only Love, and the very and only Wisdom; consequently, that it is the very and only Essence, as well as the very and only Life: for Life is Love and Wisdom. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #45 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
45. Qui aliqua cogitatione potest assequi et comprehendere Esse et Existere in se, ille omnino assequetur et comprehendet, quod illud sit Ipsum et Unicum; Ipsum dicitur quod solum Est; et Unicum a quo omne aliud. Nunc quia Ipsum et Unicum est Substantia et Forma, sequitur quod illud sit ipsa et unica Substantia et Forma; et quia ipsa illa Substantia et Forma est Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia, sequitur quod sit ipse et unicus Amor, ac ipsa et unica Sapientia, consequenter quod sit ipsa et unica Essentia, tum ipsa et unica Vita, nam Amor et Sapientia est Vita. </p>
