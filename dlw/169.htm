<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第169节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>169、这三要素，即目的、原因和结果遍及整个受造宇宙，既在它的最大事物中，也在它的最小事物中。它们在受造宇宙的最大和最小事物中，是因为它们在神造物主，也就是永恒之主里面。不过，由于主是无限的，并且有限事物里面的无限事物是有区别的一体(如17-22节所示)，所以在祂及其无限里面的这三者是有区别的一体。正因如此，从祂的存在而被造，就其功用而言为祂形像的宇宙，拥有这三者在它的一切事物里面，无论总体还是细节。</p>

<p>
169. Throughout the created universe, in its largest and smallest instances alike, we find these three--purpose, means, and result. The reason we find them in the largest and smallest instances of the created universe is that these three are in God the Creator, who is the Lord from eternity. Since he is infinite, though, and since in one who is infinite there are infinite things in a distinguishable oneness (as explained in <a href="17.htm" target=_top>17-22</a> above), these three are a distinguishable oneness in him and in the infinite things that belong to him. This is why the universe, being created from his reality and (if we look at its functions) being an image of him, retains these three in each of its constituent details. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #169 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
169. Throughout the created universe, both in its grandest constituents and in its most infinitesimal, we find these three ingredients, namely, end, cause and effect. These three are found in the grandest and most infinitesimal constituents of the universe for the reason that the same three exist in God the Creator, who is the Lord from eternity. However, because He is infinite, and because the infinite elements in an infinite being are, in a distinct combination, one (as demonstrated above in nos. <a href="17.htm">17-22</a>), therefore in Him these three also, and the three in His infinite elements, are, in a distinct combination, one.<p>It is in consequence of this that the universe - which was created from His being, and which regarded in terms of its functions is an image of Him - acquired these three ingredients in each and all of its constituents. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #169 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
169. In the created universe, both in its greatest and least things, there are those three, namely, end, cause and effect. They are in greatest and least things of the created universe, because in God the Creator Who is the Lord from eternity, there are those three. But because He is Infinite and infinite things in the Infinite are one distinctly as was shown above,<a href="17.htm">17-22</a>, therefore also those three in Him, and the three in His infinite things are one distinctly. Hence it is that the universe which has been created from His Being and which, regarded as to uses, is in His image, must possess those three in all its things in general and particular. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #169 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
169. These three, namely, end, cause, and effect, are in the created universe, both in its greatest and least parts. They are in the greatest and least parts of the created universe, because they are in God the Creator, who is the Lord from eternity. But since He is Infinite, and in the Infinite in finite things are one distinctly (as was shown above, n. <a href="17.htm" target=_top>17-22</a>), therefore also these three in Him, and in His infinites, are one distinctly. From this it is that the universe which was created from His Esse, and which, regarded as to uses, is His image, possesses these three in each and all of its parts. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #169 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
169. In Universo creato, tam in ejus maximis quam in ejus minimis, sunt tria illa, nempe finis, causa et effectus; quod tria illa in Universi creati maximis et minimis sint, est quia in Deo Creatore, qui est Dominus ab aeterno, sunt tria illa: sed quia Infinitus est, et infinita in Infinito sunt distincte unum, ut supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_169/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_17" target=_top>17-22</a> <sup>1</sup>
demonstratum est, ideo quoque tria illa in Ipso, et tria in Infinitis Ipsius, distincte unum sunt: inde est, quod Universum, quod creatum est ab Ipsius Esse, et quoad usus spectatum est imago Ipsius, obtinuerit tria illa in omnibus et singulis suis. <p>
