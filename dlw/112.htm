<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第112节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>112、由于这一点是通过天堂和天使来证明的，所以有些人可能觉得这是一个需要超凡智慧的问题。然而，其实人也是这种情形。就其心智内层而言，人同样被那太阳温暖和照亮。他们也是照着从主接受爱与智慧的量而被它的热温暖，被它的光照亮。天使和世人的不同之处在于，天使只在灵界太阳之下，而世人不仅在灵界太阳之下，还在世界的太阳之下。因为世人的身体必须在这两个太阳之下才能存活并维持；而天使的身体则不必，因为它们是属灵的。</p>

<p>
112. This may seem like a matter of higher wisdom since it is being supported by reference to heavens and angels. However, the same holds true for us. As far as the deeper levels of our minds are concerned, we are warmed and enlightened by that same sun, warmed by its warmth and enlightened by its light, to the extent that we accept love and wisdom from the Lord. The difference between angels and us is that angels are under that [spiritual] sun only, while we are not only under that sun but also under the sun of our world. Our bodies could not take form and endure if they were not under both suns. It is different for angels' bodies because they are spiritual. </p>

<p>
112. But some may regard this as a matter of superior wisdom, because we have affirmed it in terms of the heavens and angels. Yet the same is the case in relation to people. People are, in the interiors of their mind, warmed and enlightened by that same sun. They are warmed by its warmth and enlightened by its light in the measure that they receive love and wisdom from the Lord.<p>The difference between angels and people is that angels are under the spiritual sun only, while people are not only under that sun but under the sun of the world as well. For the bodies of people must be under both suns to live and survive. Not so the bodies of angels, which are spiritual. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #112 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
112. This, however, may seem as it were to be of superior wisdom because it has been confirmed by means of the heavens and the angels. But yet it is the same with men. As to the interior things of their mind, men are warmed and enlightened by that same Sun. They become warm from its heat and are enlightened by its light to the extent in which they receive love and wisdom from the Lord. The difference between angels and men is that angels are under the spiritual Sun only, while men are not only under that Sun but are also under the sun of the world. For men's bodies cannot come into being and remain in being except under both suns. It is otherwise with angels' bodies which are spiritual. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #112 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
112. As this has been proved by means of the heavens and the angels, it may seem a matter of too exalted wisdom; but the same is true of men. Men, as to the interiors of their minds, are warmed and illuminated by that same sun. They are warmed by its heat and illuminated by its light in the measure in which they receive love and wisdom from the Lord. The difference between angels and men is that angels are under the spiritual sun only, but men are not only under that sun, but also under the sun of this world; for men's bodies can begin and continue to exist only under both suns; but not so the bodies of angels, which are spiritual. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #112 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
112. Sed hoc videri potest sicut superioris sapientiae, quia confirmatum est per Coelos et per Angelos; at usque simile est apud homines; homines quoad interiora mentis eorum ab eodem Sole incalescunt et illustrantur; a calore ejus incalescunt, et a luce ejus illustrantur, quantum a Domino recipiunt amorem et sapientiam: differentia inter angelos et homines est, quod angeli solummodo sub illo Sole sint, homines autem non modo sub illo Sole, sed etiam sub Sole mundi; corpora enim hominum, nisi sint sub utroque Sole non possunt existere et subsistere; aliter corpora Angelorum quae sunt Spiritualia. </p>
