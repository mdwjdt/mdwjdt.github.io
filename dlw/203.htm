<h4 align="center"></h4><p>203、由于人的内层事物，就是他的意愿和理解力的事物，在层级上就像天堂(事实上，就其心智的内层而言，人是一个最小形式的天堂)，所以它们的完美也像天堂的完美。不过，只要人活在世上，这些完美就不会向他显明，因为此时他尚处在最低层级；从最低层级无法知道较高层级。但死后它们就被得知，因为那时人进入对应于他的爱和智慧的层级。事实上，那时他成为天使，所思所言对他的属世人来说，是妙不可言的。因为那时他心智的所有官能都有了一个提升，不是单一的提升，而是三倍的提升。高度层级以三倍的比率提升，而广度层级则以单一比率提升。然而，除了那些在世时处于真理，并将它们运用于生活的人外，没有人上升并被提入高度层级。</p>

203. Since the deeper reaches of our own minds, of our volition and discernment, are like the heavens as far as levels are concerned (we are actually miniature heavens as to the deeper reaches of our minds), their processes of perfection are similar. However, these processes are not perceptible to any of us as long as we are living in this world, since we are then on the lowest level; and the higher levels are unrecognizable from the lowest level. After death, though, we can identify them, since then we are on whatever level answers to our love and wisdom. Then we become angels and think and say things that are indescribable to our physical self. The raising up of everything in our minds then is not by some simple ratio but by the threefold ratio that is the ratio of vertical levels. The simple ratio applies to horizontal levels.<p>The only people who rise or are brought up to those levels, though, are the ones who have been attentive to truths in this world and have applied them to their lives. </p>

203. Since the interior regions in a person, which are those of his will and intellect, are like the heavens in their degrees - because a person is, in respect to the interior elements which are those of his mind, a heaven in miniature form - therefore the perfections of these are also like those of the heavens. These perfections, however, are not apparent to any person as long as he lives in the world, for he is then in the lowest degree; and from the lowest degree one cannot discern the higher degrees. But after death they are discerned, for the person then comes into the degree which corresponds to his love and wisdom. For he then becomes an angel, thinking and saying things inexpressible to his natural self. Indeed, he then experiences an elevation of all his mental faculties not in a simple progression, but in a threefold progression. This latter progression has in it degrees of height, while the first has in it degrees of breadth.<p>No others, however, ascend and are elevated into these degrees but people who in the world have been governed by truths and have applied them to life. </p>

203. Since the interior things of man, which belong to his will and understanding, are like the heavens as to degrees (for man, as to the interiors of his mind, is a heaven in least form), so also their perfections are similar. But these perfections are not apparent to any man while he is living in the world, for he is then in the lowest degree, and from the lowest degree the higher degrees cannot be known. But after death they are known. For then man comes into that degree which corresponds to his love and wisdom, for he then becomes an angel, and thinks and speaks things ineffable to his natural man. For there is then an elevation of all things of his mind, not in a single, but in a threefold ratio. Degrees of height are in this threefold ratio, but degrees of breadth are in single ratio. But into those degrees none ascend and are elevated, except those who, in the world, have been in truths, and have applied them to life. </p>

 203. Quoniam interiora hominis quae ejus voluntatis et intellectus sunt, similia sunt Coelis quoad gradus, est enim homo, quoad interiora quae Mentis ejus sunt, Coelum in minima forma, ideo etiam illorum perfectiones similes sunt: sed illae perfectiones non apparent alicui homini quamdiu in Mundo vivit, tunc enim in infimo gradu est; et ex infimo gradu non possunt cognosci gradus superiores, sed post mortem cognoscuntur; nam tunc homo in illum gradum venit, qui ejus amori et sapientiae correspondet, fit enim tunc Angelus, ac ineffabilia naturali suo homini cogitat et loquitur: est enim tunc elevatio omnium ejus mentis non in ratione simplici, sed in ratione triplicata; in hac ratione sunt gradus altitudinis, in illa autem gradus latitudinis. Sed in gradus illos non alii ascendunt et elevantur, quam qui in Mundo in veris fuerunt, et illa applicuerunt vitae. </p>
