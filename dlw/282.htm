<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第四部分</h4><h4 align="center">4.1 永恒之主，就是耶和华，从祂自己，而非从无创造了宇宙及其万物</h4><p>282、世人都知道，并且凡有智慧的人出于一种内在觉察也都承认有一位神，宇宙的创造者。人们还从圣言知道，神，宇宙的创造者被称为“耶和华”；这个名字源自动词“存在”，因为唯独祂存在。永恒之主就是那耶和华，这一点在《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》中通过引用取自圣言的大量证据而得以证明。耶和华被称为永恒之主，因为耶和华取了一个人身，以拯救人们脱离地狱；祂还吩咐自己的门徒称祂为主。所以，在新约，耶和华被称为“主”，这从下列经文可以看出来：<br><br>你要用你全部的心、全部的灵魂爱耶和华你的神。(申命记6:5) <br><br>而在新约：<br><br>你要用你全部的心、全部的灵魂爱主你的神。(马太福音22:37) <br><br>类似的替换可见于福音书中取自旧约的其它经文。</p>

282. Angelic Wisdom about Divine Love, Part 4.
<p>The Lord from eternity, who is Jehovah, created the universe and everything in it not from nothing but from himself. It is known worldwide and acknowledged through an inner perception by everyone who is wise that there is one God who is the creator of the universe. Further, the Word informs us that the God who created the universe is called "Jehovah," from "being," because God alone is. In "Teachings for the New Jerusalem on the Lord" there is ample evidence from the Word that the Lord from eternity is that Jehovah.
<p>Jehovah is called the Lord from eternity because Jehovah took on a human nature in order to save us from hell. At that time too he commanded his disciples to call him "Lord." So in the New Testament, Jehovah is called "the Lord," as we can tell from [the citation of the verse] "You shall love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_6_5.htm" target=_top>Deuteronomy 6:5</a>) [as] "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul" in the New Testament (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_35.htm" target=_top>Matthew 22:35</a> [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_37.htm" target=_top>37</a>]). We find the same in other Old Testament passages cited in the Gospels. </p>

282. PART FOUR<p>The Lord from eternity, who is Jehovah, created the universe and everything in it from Himself and not from nothing. People throughout the world know, and every wise person from an interior perception acknowledges, that there is one God who is the Creator of the universe. People also know from the Word that God, the Creator of the universe, is called Jehovah, so named from the verb to be, because He alone just is. <sup>1</sup>
That the Lord from eternity is that Jehovah - this we demonstrated in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord by citing many proofs from the Word.<p>Jehovah is called the Lord from eternity because it was Jehovah who assumed a humanity in order to save people from hell. Moreover at that time He commanded His disciples to call Him Lord. <sup>2</sup>
Consequently in the New Testament Jehovah is called the Lord, as can be seen from considering the following statement. <p>[In the Old Testament:]
<p>You shall love Jehovah your God with all your heart, and with all your soul... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_6_5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>)<p>And in the New Testament:<p>You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>)<p>The same substitution is found in other passages taken from the Old Testament and quoted in the Gospels.<p>

1.&nbsp;See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_3_13.htm">Exodus 3:13-15</a>. Cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_58.htm">John 8:58</a>. The name Jehovah in Hebrew (יָהוֶה) is derived from the verb הֹוָה (=היה) meaning be, and it resembles the third person form יָהיָה meaning he is. The Hebrew verb form is imperfect in aspect, so that it encompasses also the meanings he will be and he has been. Cf. the phrase who is and who was and who is to come in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_11_17.htm">11:17</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_13.htm">John 13:13</a>. </p>

282. PART IV <p>THE LORD FROM ETERNITY, WHO IS JEHOVAH, CREATED THE UNIVERSE AND ALL THINGS THEREOF FROM HIMSELF, AND NOT FROM NOTHING <p>It is known throughout the world, and acknowledged by every wise man from interior perception that God Who is the Creator of the universe is one. And it is known from the Word that God the Creator of the universe is called "Jehovah," from the verb "to be," because He alone is. It has been shown in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD by many passages in the Word that the Lord from eternity is that same Jehovah. Jehovah is called the Lord from eternity, because Jehovah assumed a Human in order that He might save men from hell. And later He commanded His disciples to call Him Lord. Therefore in the New Testament Jehovah is called "the Lord," as can be established from the following: <p>Thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_6_5.htm">Deut. 6:5</a> <p>And in the New Testament: <p>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_37.htm">Matt. 22:37</a> <p>It is the same in other passages in the Evangelists, taken from the Old Testament. </p>

282. PART FOURTH. <p>THE LORD FROM ETERNITY, WHO IS JEHOVAH, CREATED THE UNIVERSE AND ALL THINGS THEREOF FROM HIMSELF, AND NOT FROM NOTHING. <p>It is known throughout the world, and acknowledged by every wise man from interior perception, that God, who is the Creator of the universe, is One; and it is known from the Word that God the Creator of the universe is called "Jehovah," which is from the verb to be, because He alone is. That the Lord from eternity is that Jehovah is shown by many statements from the Word in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Concerning the Lord. Jehovah is called the Lord from eternity, since Jehovah assumed a Human that He might save men from hell; He then commanded His disciples to call Him Lord. Therefore in the New Testament Jehovah is called "the Lord;" as can be seen from this: <p>Thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul (Deut. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_6_5.htm" target=_top>6:5</a>); <p>but in the New Testament: <p>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_37.htm" target=_top>Matt. 22:37</a>). <p>It is the same in other passages in the Gospels, taken from the Old Testament. </p>

282. PARS QUARTA <p>QUOD DOMINUS AB AETERNO, QUI EST JEHOVAH, CREAVERIT UNIVERSUM ET OMNIA EJUS A SEIPSO, ET NON A NIHILO. In Universo terrarum orbe notum est, et ab omni Sapiente ex interiori perceptione agnitum, quod Deus unus sit, qui Creator Universi; et ex Verbo notum est, quod Deus Creator Universi dicatur JEHOVAH, ex Esse quia Solus Est: quod Dominus ab aeterno sit ille Jehovah, in DOCTRINA NOVAE HIEROSOLYMAE DE DOMINO multis ex Verbo demonstratum est. Jehovah vocatur Dominus ab aeterno, quia Jehovah assumsit Humanum, ut salvaret homines ab Inferno; et tunc mandavit discipulis, ut Ipsum vocarent Dominum: quare Jehovah in Novo Testamento vocatur Dominus; ut constare potest ex hoc[,] "Amabis JEHOVAM DEUM TUUM ex toto corde tuo, et ex tota anima tua[,]" <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_282/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_6_5" target=_top>Deuteronomium 6:5</a>, et in Novo Testamento[,] "Amabis DOMINUM DEUM TUUM ex toto corde tuo et ex tota anima tua[,]" <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_282/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_22_35" target=_top>Matthaeum 22:35</a>. <sup>1</sup>
