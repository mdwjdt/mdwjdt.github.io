<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第109节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>109、灵界太阳的距离同样如此，这太阳是主的神性之爱与神性智慧的最先发出。真相是，距离并不存在，只是一个表象，它取决于天使在其层级上对神性之爱与神性智慧的接受。灵界的距离只是表象，这一点从前面的说明可以看出来，如：神性不在空间中(7-9节)；神性充满一切空间，却无关空间(69-72节)。没有空间，就没有距离；或也可说，如果空间是表象，那么距离也是表象，因为距离属于空间。</p>

<p>
109. It is the same with the distance of the spiritual world's sun, the sun that is the first emanation of the Lord's divine love and wisdom. The truth is that there is no distance. Rather, the distance is an appearance that depends on angels' acceptance of divine love and wisdom on their own level. It makes sense that distances in the spiritual world are appearances when we consider what has been presented already, like the material in <a href="7.htm" target=_top>7-9</a> [<a href="7.htm" target=_top>7-10</a>] on Divinity not being in space and in <a href="69.htm" target=_top>69-72</a> on Divinity filling all space nonspatially. If there are no segments of space, then there are no distances either; or in other words, if segments of space are appearances, so are distances, since distances are a matter of space. </p>

<p>
109. The same is the case with the distance of the sun in the spiritual world, the sun which is the first emanation of the Lord's Divine love and wisdom. The truth is that there is no distance. Rather the distance is an appearance in accordance with the degree of the angels' reception of Divine love and wisdom.<p>That distances in the spiritual world are appearances can be seen from points we demonstrated above, as from those in nos. <a href="7.htm">7-10</a>, showing that the Divine does not exist in space, and from those in nos. <a href="69.htm">69-72</a>, showing that the Divine fills every space and interval of space independently of space. If, then, there are no intervals of space, neither are there distances, or to say the same thing, if intervals of space are appearances, distances also are appearances, for distances are intervals of space. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #109 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
109. It is the same with the distance of the Sun of the spiritual world, which Sun is the first going forth of the Lord's Divine Love and Wisdom. The truth is that there is no distance, but that distance is an appearance according to the reception of the Divine Love and Wisdom in their degree by the angels. That distances in the spiritual world are appearances may be established from these things shown above (as in<a href="7.htm">7-9</a>), that the Divine is not in space, and (in<a href="69.htm">69-72</a>) that the Divine apart from space fills all spaces; and if there are not spaces, neither are there distances, or what is the same, if spaces are appearances, distances also are appearances, for distances are spatial. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #109 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
109. It is the same with the distance of the sun of the spiritual world, which sun is the first proceeding of the Lord's Divine Love and Divine Wisdom. The truth is that there is no distance, but that the distance is an appearance according to the reception of Divine Love and Wisdom by the angels in their degree. That distances, in the spiritual world, are appearances may be seen from what <a href="7.htm" target=_top>(Divine Love and Wisdom 7-9)</a> has been shown above (as in n. 7- 9, That the Divine is not in space; and in <a href="69.htm" target=_top>n. 69-72</a>, That the Divine, apart from space, fills all spaces). If there are no spaces, there are no distances, or, what is the same, if spaces are appearances, distances also are appearances, for distances are of space. </p>

<p>
109. Simile est cum distantia Solis Mundi Spiritualis, qui Sol est primum procedens Divini Amoris et Divinae sapientiae Domini: veritas est quod nulla distantia sit; sed quod distantia sit apparentia secundum receptionem Divini Amoris et Divinae sapientiae in suo gradu ab angelis: quod distantiae in Mundo spirituali sint apparentiae, constare potest ex illis quae supra demonstrata sunt, ut ex illis <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_109/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_7" target=_top>7-10</a>, <sup>1</sup>
quod Divinum non sit in spatio; et ex illis <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_109/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_69" target=_top>69-72</a>, quod Divinum impleat omnia spatia absque spatio; et si non spatia sunt, nec sunt distantiae, vel quod idem, si spatia sunt apparentiae, etiam distantiae sunt apparentiae, nam distantiae sunt spatii. <p>
