<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">1.15 一切受造物都以某种形像与人有相似之处</h4><p>61、这一点从动物界的每一个事物、植物界的每一个事物、矿物界的每一个事物明显看出来。在动物界的每一个事物中，与人的相似之处从以下观察明显看出来：各种动物皆有用来行动的肢体、用来感觉的器官和用来驱动这些的脏腑，这是动物与人的共同之处。它们也有各种欲望和情感，与人的属世欲望和情感相似；还有与其情感相对应的与生俱来的知识，其中有些知识似乎还显示出属灵的元素，这些元素在地上的走兽、空中的飞鸟、蜜蜂、蚕、蚂蚁等动物身上或多或少地看得出来。正因如此，纯属世人认为动物界的活物就像他们自己，只是不会说话罢了。<br><br>在植物界的每一个事物中，与人的相似之处从以下观察明显看出来：植物从种子萌发，此后按它们的生长周期逐步发展；它们有某种类似婚姻的特征，这些特征带来生育；它们的植物灵魂就是功用，它们是功用的形式；此外还有许多与人的相似之处，一些作家也对此作过描述。<br><br>在矿物界的每一个事物中，与人的相似之处只能从它们努力产出显示这种相似之处的形式(如前所述，这些形式就是植物界的一切事物)，从而努力发挥功用看出来。因为一旦一粒种子落入大地的怀抱，大地便呵护它，从自己那里在各个方面为它提供滋养，好使它迅速生长，以代表人的一个形式呈现自己。这种努力也存在于地上的贫瘠地区，这一点从海底的珊瑚和矿山的鲜花明显看出来，这二者是从矿物盐和金属矿石中长出来的。这种要进入植物的生命，并由此发挥功用的努力，是神性在受造物中最外在的效果。</p>

61. All the things that have been created reflect the human in some respect. There is evidence for this in every detail of the animal kingdom, in every detail of the plant kingdom, and in every detail of the mineral kingdom.<p>We can see ourselves reflected in every detail of the animal kingdom from the fact that all kinds of animal have in common with us members for locomotion, sensory organs, and the inner organs that support these activities. They also have their impulses and desires like our own physical ones. They have the innate knowledge proper to their desires, with an apparently spiritual element visible in some of them, more or less obvious to the eye in the beasts of the earth, the fowl of the heavens, bees, silkworms, ants, and the like. This is why merely earthly-minded people regard the living creatures of this kingdom as much like themselves, lacking only speech.<p>We can see ourselves reflected in every detail of the plant kingdom in the way plants grow from seeds and go through their successive stages of life. They have something like marriages with births that follow. Their vegetative "soul" is the function to which they give form. There are many other ways in which they reflect us, which some writers have described.<p>We can see ourselves reflected in every detail of the mineral kingdom simply in its effort to produce the forms that reflect us--all the details of the plant kingdom, as I have just noted--and to perform its proper functions in this way. The moment a seed falls into earth's lap, she nurtures it and from all around offers it resources from herself for its sprouting and emerging in a form representative of humanity. We can see this effort in solid mineral materials if we look at deep-sea corals or at flowers in mines, where they spring from minerals and metals. This effort toward becoming plant life and thereby performing a useful function is the outermost element of Divinity in created things. </p>

<p>61. Everything that has been created exhibits in some image of him a resemblance to the human being. This can be seen in each and every constituent of the animal kingdom, in each and every constituent of the plant kingdom, and in each and every constituent of the mineral kingdom.<p>A resemblance to the human being in each and every constituent of the animal kingdom is apparent from the following observations: Animals of every kind have appendages used for locomotion, organs used for sensing, and viscera used to power these - components that they have in common with the human being. They possess also appetites and affections similar to the natural appetites and affections in the human being. Inborn in them, too, are various kinds of knowledge corresponding to their affections, some of which exhibit a seemingly spiritual element that in beasts of the earth, in birds of the air, in bees, silkworms, ants, and the like, is more or less visible to the eye. So it is that merely natural people deem creatures of this kingdom to be like themselves, lacking only the power of speech.<p> </p>
<p>[2] A resemblance to the human being in each and every constituent of the plant kingdom is apparent from the following observations: Plants grow from seed and develop from it progressively through stages of their life. They possess some features akin to those involved in marriage, and these result in procreation. Their vegetative soul is one of useful endeavor, which they give form to. And they exhibit many other characteristics as well resembling those of the human being - characteristics which several observers have described.<p> </p>
<p>[3] A resemblance to the human being in each and every constituent of the mineral kingdom is apparent simply in their endeavor to produce forms which exhibit that resemblance - these being, as we said, each and every constituent of the plant kingdom - and so in their endeavor to perform useful services. For as soon as a seed falls into the bosom of the earth, the earth nurtures it and from every side supplies from itself an abundance of what it needs to sprout and exhibit itself in a form representative of the human being. That this endeavor exists also in earth's infertile areas is apparent from corals formed at the bottom of seas, and from efflorescences in mines, formed there both from mineral salts and from metal ores.<p>The endeavor to endow themselves with vegetable forms and so perform useful services is the outmost effect of the Divine in created things. </p>

<p>61. ALL CREATED THINGS HAVE, IN A CERTAIN IMAGE, RELATION TO MAN <p>This can be established from each and every thing of the animal kingdom, from each and every thing of the vegetable kingdom, and from each and every thing of the mineral kingdom. <p>The relation in (in omnibus et singulis) each and every thing of the animal kingdom to man is evident from the following. Animals of every kind have limbs by which they move, organs by which they feel and viscera by which these are actuated. These things they have in common with man. They have also appetites and affections similar to man's natural appetites and affections. And they have connate knowledges corresponding to their affections, In some of which there appears something spiritual which is more or less in evidence in the beasts of the earth, the birds of the air, and in bees, silk-worms, ants, etc. And so it is that merely natural men regard the living creatures of this kingdom as like themselves, except for speech. <p>The relation out of (ex omnibus et singulis) each and all things of the vegetable kingdom to man is evident from the following. They come forth out of seed, and from that proceed successively through their several stages. They have what is akin to marriage, followed by prolification, their vegetable soul (anima) is use, of which they are forms, besides many other things which have relation to men. These also have been described by various writers. <p>The relation by (ab omnibus et singulis) each and all things of the mineral kingdom to man is seen only in the endeavour to produce forms which do show relation, (which forms are, as was said, each and all things of the vegetable kingdom), and so to perform uses. For when a seed first sinks into the bosom of the earth, the earth cherishes it, and from herself provides it with nourishment from every source so that it may sprout forth and present itself in a form representative of man. That there is such an endeavour also in its solid parts is evident from corals at the bottom of the sea, and from flowers in mines [originating] there from minerals and also from metals. The endeavour towards vegetating and thus towards performing uses is an ultimate derived from the Divine in created things. </p>

61. ALL CREATED THINGS HAVE RELATION IN A KIND OF IMAGE TO MAN. <p>This can be seen from each and all things of the animal kingdom, from each and all things of the vegetable kingdom, and from each and all things of the mineral kingdom. <p>A relation to man in each and all things of the animal kingdom is evident from the following. Animals of every kind have limbs by which they move, organs by which they feel, and viscera by which these are exercised; these they have in common with man. They have also appetites and affections similar to man's natural appetites and affections; and they have inborn knowledges corresponding to their affections, in some of which there appears a resemblance to what is spiritual, which is more or less evident in beasts of the earth, and birds of the air, and in bees, silk-worms, ants, etc. From this it is that merely natural men consider the living creatures of this kingdom to be like themselves, except in the matter of speech. <p>A relation to man arising out of each and all things of the vegetable kingdom is evident from this: they spring forth from seed, and thereafter proceed step by step through their periods of growth; they have something akin to marriage, followed by prolification; their vegetative soul is use, and they are forms thereof; besides many other particulars which have relation to man. These also have been described by various authors. <p>A relation to man deducible from each and every thing of the mineral kingdom is seen only in an endeavor to produce forms which exhibit such a relation (which forms, as said above, are each and all things of the vegetable kingdom), and in an endeavor to perform uses thereby. For when first a seed falls into the bosom of the earth, she cherishes it, and out of herself provides it with nourishment from every source, that it may shoot up and present itself in a form representative of man. That such an endeavor exists also in its solid parts is evident from corals at the bottom of the seas and from flowers in mines, where they originate from minerals, also from metals. This endeavor towards vegetating, and performing uses thereby, is the outmost derivation from the Divine in created things. </p>

<p>61. QUOD OMNIA QUAE CREATA SUNT IN QUADAM IMAGINE REFERANT HOMINEM. Hoc constare potest ex omnibus et singulis Regni animalis; exque omnibus et singulis Regni vegetabilis; et ex omnibus et singulis Regni mineralis. Relatio ad hominem in omnibus et singulis Regni animalis, patet ex his; quod Animalibus omnis generis sint membra per quae se movent, organa per quae sentiunt, et viscera per quae actuant illa, quae illis communia sunt cum homine; sunt quoque illis appetitus et affectiones, similes naturalibus apud hominem; et sunt scientiae connatae affectionibus illorum correspondentes, in quarum aliquibus apparet sicut spirituale, quod apud bestias terrae, volucres coeli, apud apes, bombyces, formicas etc. plus et minus exstat coram oculis: inde est, quod mere naturales homines faciant animantia illius Regni sui similia, praeter loquelam.
<p> </p>
<p>[2] Relatio ad hominem ex omnibus et singulis Regni vegetabilis, patet ex his; quod ex semine existant, et ex illo successive in aetates suas progrediantur; quod illis aliqua connubii similia sint, et post illa prolificatio; quod anima vegetativa illorum sit usus, cujus formae sunt, praeter plura alia, quae sunt relationes ad hominem; quae etiam a quibusdam descriptae sunt.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Relatio ad hominem ab omnibus et singulis Regni mineralis, apparet solum in conatu producendi formas quae referunt, <sup>1</sup>
quae sunt, ut dictum est, omnia et singula Regni vegetabilis, et sic usus praestandi; ut primum enim semen in gremium terrae illabitur, fovet illud, et ab undequaque dat ex se copias, ut egerminet, et se sistat in forma repraesentativa hominis; quod talis conatus etiam sit in siccis ejus, patet a coralliis in fundo marium, exque floribus in fodinis, ibi ex mineris, et quoque ex metallis. Conatus ad vegetandum se, et sic praestandi usus, est ultimum ex Divino in creatis. <p>
