<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">2.9 在灵界，方位不是由显为太阳的主创造的，而是由天使照其接受创造的</h4><p>124、我们说过，天使彼此分开居住：有的住在东方，有的住在西方，有的住在南方，有的住在北方。住在东方的人处于爱的较高层级，住在西方的人处于爱的较低层级；住在南方的人处于智慧之光中，住在北方的人处于智慧的相对幽暗中。居所的这种多样性看似由显为太阳的主造成的，其实是由天使造成的。主在这位天使里面所在爱与智慧的层级并不比在那位天使里面的更大或更小；也就是说，显为太阳的主在这位天使里面所在热与光的层级并不比在那位天使里面的更大或更小，因为祂处处都是一样的。但天使对祂的接受却彼此不同；这使得他们彼此之间好像有或远或近的距离，在方位上也各不相同。由此可推知，在灵界，方位无非是对爱与智慧的各种不同程度的接受，因而是对来自显为太阳的主之热与光的各种不同程度的接受。这一事实从前面的说明(参看108-112节)清楚看出来，即：在灵界，距离只是表象。</p>

124. The regions in the spiritual world are not caused by the Lord as the sun but by the angels, depending on their receptivity. I have stated that angels live in distinct regions, some in the east, some in the west, some in the south, and some in the north. I have also stated that the ones who live in the east are engaged in a higher level of love, those in the west in a lower level of love, those in the south in the light of wisdom, and those in the north in the shadow of wisdom.<p>This variation of place seems to be caused by the Lord as the sun, yet it is actually caused by the angels. The Lord is not at a greater or lesser degree of love and wisdom; as the sun, he is not at a greater or lesser level of warmth and light for one person than for another. He is everywhere the same. However, he is not accepted at the same level by one person as by another, and this makes it seem as though they are more or less distant from each other, in a variety of regions. It follows from this that the regions in the spiritual world are simply variations in the receptivity of love and wisdom and therefore of the warmth and light of the Lord as the sun. If you look at what was explained in <a href="108.htm" target=_top>108-112</a> about distances in the spiritual world being apparent only, you will see that this is true. </p>

124. The zones in the spiritual world are not created by the Lord as the sun, but they are created by the angels in accordance with their reception. We have said that angels live apart from each other, some in the eastern zone, some in the western zone, some in the southern zone, and some in the northern zone. We also said that those who live in the eastern zone possess a higher degree of love, those in the western zone a lower degree of love, those in the southern zone wisdom in a state of light, and those in the northern zone wisdom in a state of comparative darkness.<p>This diversity in the regions of their abodes appears to be caused by the Lord as the sun, when in fact it is caused by the angels. The Lord is not present with a greater or lesser degree of love and wisdom in one angel than in another, or as the sun He is not present with a greater or lesser degree of warmth and light in one than in another, for He is everywhere the same. But He is not received by this or that angel in the same degree, and the difference in reception causes the angels to appear to themselves to be more or less distant from each other, and also to be situated variously in relation to the points of the compass.<p>It follows from this that the zones in the spiritual world are simply reflections of the angels' differing degrees of reception of love and wisdom and so of warmth and light from the Lord as the sun.<p>The fact of this is apparent from points we demonstrated above in nos. <a href="108.htm">108-112</a>, showing that distances in the spiritual world are appearances. </p>

124. THE QUARTERS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD ARE NOT FROM THE LORD AS THE SUN, BUT FROM THE ANGELS ACCORDING TO RECEPTION <p>It has been stated that the angels dwell separately from each other, some in the eastern quarter, some in the western, some in the southern and some in the northern; and that those who dwell in the eastern quarter are in a higher degree of love, those in the western in a lower degree of love, those in the southern in the light of wisdom and those in the northern in the shade of wisdom. This diversity of dwelling-places appears as it were from the Lord as the Sun, when yet it is from the angels. The Lord is not in a greater or lesser degree of love and wisdom, that is, He as the Sun is not in a greater or lesser degree of heat and light with one than with another for He is everywhere the same. But He is not received by one in the same degree as by another. This makes them appear to themselves to be more or less distant from one another, and also variously according to the quarters. From this it follows that the quarters in the spiritual world are nothing else than varying receptions of love and wisdom, and so of heat and light from the Lord as the Sun. That this is the case is clear from the things shown above (<a href="108.htm">108-112</a>) that distances in the spiritual world are appearances. </p>

124. THE QUARTERS IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD ARE NOT FROM THE LORD AS A SUN, BUT FROM THE ANGELS ACCORDING TO RECEPTION. <p>It has been stated that the angels dwell separate from each other; some in the eastern quarter, some in the western, some in the southern, and some in the northern; and that those who dwell in the eastern quarter are in a higher degree of love; those in the western, in a lower degree of love; those in the southern, in the light of wisdom; and those in the northern, in the shade of wisdom. This diversity of dwelling-places appears as though it were from the Lord as a sun, when, in fact it is from the angels. The Lord is not in a greater and lesser degree of love and wisdom, that is, as a sun He is not in a greater or lesser degree of heat and light with one than with another, for He is everywhere the same. But He is not received by one in the same degree as by another; and this makes them appear to themselves to be more or less distant from one another, and also variously as regards the quarters. From this it follows that quarters - in the spiritual world are nothing else than various receptions of love and wisdom, and thence of heat and light from the Lord as a sun. That this is so is plain from what was shown above (n. <a href="108.htm" target=_top>108-112</a>), that in the spiritual world distances are appearances. </p>

124. QUOD PLAGAE IN MUNDO SPIRITUALI NON SINT A DOMINO UT SOLE, SED QUOD SINT AB ANGELIS SECUNDUM RECEPTIONEM. Dictum est, quod Angeli habitent distincti inter se, quidam in Plaga orientali, quidam in occidentali, quidam in meridionali, et quidam in septentrionali; et quod qui in Plaga orientali habitant, sint in amoris superiori gradu, qui in occidentali in amoris inferiori gradu, qui in meridionali in sapientiae luce, et qui in septentrionali in sapientiae umbra. Illa habitationum diversitas apparet sicut sit a Domino ut Sole, cum tamen est ab Angelis; Dominus non est in majori et minori gradu amoris et sapientiae, seu Ipse ut Sol non est in majori et minori gradu caloris et lucis, apud unum quam apud alterum, est enim ubivis idem; sed non recipitur ab uno et ab altero in simili gradu; et hoc facit ut appareant sibi inter se distare plus et minus, et quoque varie secundum plagas: ex quo sequitur, quod Plagae in Mundo spirituali non aliud sint, quam variae Receptiones amoris et sapientiae, et inde caloris et lucis ex Domino ut Sole: quod ita sit, patet a demonstratis supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_124/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_108" target=_top>108-112</a>, quod Distantiae in Mundo spirituali sint apparentiae. </p>
