<h4 align="center"></h4><p>208、总之，一切最终元素，因而一切结果里面都有这样的层级。因为一切最终元素皆由在先元素构成，在先元素则由它们的最初元素构成。每个结果都由一个原因构成，这个原因则由一个目的构成；目的是原因的全部，原因则是结果的全部(如前所示)。目的构成最内在的元素，原因构成中间元素，结果构成最外在的元素。爱与智慧、热与光，以及人里面情感与思维的有机形式，其层级也是如此，这一点可见于下文。我们在《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》(38节等)论述了在先后秩序和同步秩序中的这些层级的系列，在那里说明，这类层级就存在于圣言的一切事物中。</p>

208. In short, there are levels like this in every final form and therefore in every effect, since every final form consists of antecedents that in turn consist of things primary to them. Likewise every result comes from a means and every means from a purpose, the purpose being the whole essence of the means and the means the whole essence of the result, as I have just explained [<a href="168.htm" target=_top>168</a>, <a href="197.htm" target=_top>197</a>]. Further, the purpose constitutes the center, the means the intermediate, and the result the final outcome.<p>We will see later [<a href="224.htm" target=_top>224</a>, <a href="231.htm" target=_top>231</a>, <a href="232.htm" target=_top>232</a>, <a href="235.htm" target=_top>235</a>, <a href="236.htm" target=_top>236-241</a>] that the same holds for levels of love and wisdom, warmth and light, and for the organized forms of feelings and thoughts within us. I have discussed the sequence of these levels in sequential and simultaneous arrangements in <a href="../ss/38.htm" target=_top>Teachings for the New Jerusalem on Sacred Scripture 38</a> and elsewhere, showing that there are similar levels in all the details of the Word. </p>

208. Degrees of this kind, in short, exist in every final element, thus in every effect; for every final element is formed of prior ones, and these by their prime ones. Moreover, every effect results from a cause, and the cause from an end, so that the end is everything in the cause, and the cause is everything in the effect, as we demonstrated above. Thus the end constitutes the inmost element, the cause the intermediate element, and the effect the final element.<p>The same is the case with degrees of love and wisdom, with degrees of heat and light, and with the organic forms of the affections and thoughts in a person, as will be seen in subsequent discussions.<p>We have dealt with the succession of these degrees in sequential order and in concurrent order also in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, no. <a href="38.htm">38</a> and elsewhere, where we showed that degrees of this kind exist in each and every expression of the Word. </p>

208. In a word, there are such degrees in every ultimate, thus in every effect. For every ultimate consists of things prior, and these of their primes. And every effect consists from cause, and this from end. And end is the all of cause, and cause is the all of effect, as was shown above; and end makes the inmost, cause the middle, and effect the outmost. The same is the case with degrees of love and wisdom, of heat and light, also of the organic forms of affections and thoughts in man, as will be seen in what follows. The series of these degrees in successive and simultaneous order has been treated of in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE (<a href="../ss/38.htm">38</a> and elsewhere), it is shown there that there are like degrees in all things of the Word in general and in particular. </p>

<p>
208. In a word, there are such degrees in every outmost, thus in every effect. For every outmost consists of things prior and these of their firsts. And every effect consists of a cause, and this of an end; and end is the all of cause, and cause is the all of effect (as was shown above); and end makes the inmost, cause the middle, and effect the outmost. The same is true of degrees of love and wisdom, and of heat and light, also of the organic forms of affections and thoughts in man (as will be seen in what follows). The series of these degrees in successive order and in simultaneous order has been treated of also in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Concerning the Sacred Scripture n. <a href="../ss/38.htm" target=_top>38</a>, and elsewhere, where it is shown that there are like degrees in each and all things of the Word. </p>

208. Verbo[,] tales gradus sunt in omni ultimo, ita in omni effectu; nam omne ultimum consistit ex prioribus, et haec a suis primis; ac omnis effectus consistit ex causa, et haec ex fine, et finis est omne causae, et causa est omne effectus, ut supra demonstratum est, ac finis facit intimum, causa medium, et effectus ultimum. Quod simile sit cum gradibus amoris et sapientiae, caloris et lucis, tum cum formis organicis affectionum et cogitationum apud hominem, in sequentibus videbitur. De serie horum graduum in Ordine successivo et in Ordine simultaneo actum etiam est in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_208/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_38" target=_top>DOCTRINA NOVAE HIEROSOLYMAE DE SCRIPTURA SACRA 38</a> et alibi, [ubi] ostensum est quod similes gradus in omnibus et singulis Verbi <sup>1</sup>
sint. <p>
