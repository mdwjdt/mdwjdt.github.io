<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">2.7 天使在主里面，主在天使里面；由于天使只是容器，故唯独主是天堂</h4><p>113、天堂被称为“神的居所或住处”，以及“神的宝座”；于是，人们以为神住在天堂，如同一位国王住在他的王国。但是神，也就是主，在众天堂之上的太阳中，通过祂在光与热中的存在而存在于众天堂(如前两章所示)。不过，主虽以这种方式存在于天堂，但在那里仍如同在祂自己里面。因为如前所示(108-112节)，太阳与天堂之间的距离并非距离，而是距离的表象。由于距离只是表象，故可推知，主本身就在天堂，因为祂在天堂天使的爱与智慧里面；由于主在一切天使的爱与智慧里面，而天使又组成天堂，所以主在整个天堂。</p>

113. Angels are in the Lord and the Lord is in them; and since angels are vessels, the Lord alone is heaven. Heaven is called God's dwelling and God's throne, so people think that God lives there like a monarch in a realm. However, God--that is, the Lord--is in the sun above the heavens and is in the heavens by means of his presence in warmth and light, as I have explained in the last two sections. Further, even though the Lord is present in heaven in this apparently distant way, he is still also intrinsically present there, so to speak, since as I have just explained in <a href="103.htm" target=_top>103-112</a> the distance between the sun and heaven is not a distance but a virtual distance. Given the fact that this distance is only apparent, then, it follows that the Lord himself is in heaven. He is in the love and wisdom of heaven's angels; and since he is in the love and wisdom of all the angels and the angels make up heaven, he is in all of heaven. </p>

113. Angels are in the Lord and have the Lord in them; <sup>1</sup>
and because angels are recipient vessels, the Lord alone is heaven. Heaven is called the habitation or dwelling place of God, <sup>2</sup>
and also the throne of God, <sup>3</sup>
and consequently people believe that God dwells there as a king in his kingdom. But God, or the Lord, is in the sun above the heavens, and He is present in the heavens by His presence in their heat and light, as we showed in the discussions under the previous two headings. Moreover, even though that is how the Lord is present in heaven, still He is present there as He is in Himself, for as we demonstrated just above in nos. <a href="108.htm">108-112</a>, the distance between the sun and heaven is not distance but an appearance of distance. Consequently, since that distance is only an appearance, it follows that the Lord Himself is present in heaven, for He is present in the love and wisdom of the angels in heaven. And because He is present in the love and wisdom of all angels, and angels constitute heaven, He is present in the whole of heaven.<p>

113. ANGELS ARE IN THE LORD, AND THE LORD IS IN THEM; AND BECAUSE ANGELS ARE RECIPIENTS, THE LORD ALONE IS HEAVEN <p>Heaven is called "the dwelling-place of God," also "the throne of God" and from this it is believed that God is there just as a king is in his kingdom. But God, that is, the Lord is in the Sun above the heavens, and by His presence in the heat and light, is in the heavens (as has been shown in two previous sections). But although the Lord is in that manner in heaven, still He is there as in Himself, for (as shown just above<a href="108.htm">108-112</a>) the distance between the Sun and heaven is not distance but an appearance of distance.

113. QUOD ANGELI SINT IN DOMINO, ET DOMINUS IN ILLIS; ET QUIA ANGELI SUNT RECIPIENTES, QUOD SOLUS DOMINUS SIT COELUM. Coelum vocatur Habitaculum Dei, et quoque Thronus Dei, et inde creditur quod Deus ibi sit, sicut est Rex in suo Regno; sed Deus, hoc est, Dominus, in Sole supra coelos est, et per praesentiam Ipsius in Calore et Luce est in Coelis, ut in binis Articulis superioribus ostensum est, et tametsi Dominus eo modo est in Coelo, usque est ibi ut in Se, nam ut mox supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_113/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_108" target=_top>108-112</a> demonstratum est, est distantia inter Solem et Coelum non distantia, sed apparentia distantiae; quare cum distantia illa est solum apparentia, sequitur quod Ipse Dominus sit in Coelo, est enim in Amore et Sapientia Angelorum Coeli; et quia est in amore et sapientia omnium Angelorum, et Angeli constituunt Coelum, est in universo Coelo. </p>
