<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第152节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>152、在第一部分，尤其52至54节，我们已充分说明：宇宙万物由神性之爱和神性智慧创造；在此将说明，创造是通过灵界太阳成就的，这太阳是神性之爱和神性智慧的最先发出。凡能从原因看见结果，然后通过原因看见在自己秩序和系列中的结果之人，都无法否认，太阳是创造的首工；事实上，存在于其行星系统中的一切事物都从太阳获得持续存在；由于它们从太阳获得持续存在，所以其存在起源于太阳。一个事实能指向并证明其它事实；一切事物都在太阳的视野之下，因为太阳决定了它们必是如此，将它们保持在它的视野之下就是不断稳固它们。这就是为何我们说持续存在就是不断存在。此外，任何事物若从经由大气而来的太阳流注中完全退出，就会立刻消散；事实上，越来越纯，并因这太阳而在运作中变得活跃的大气将一切事物联结在一起。宇宙及其万物的持续存在是由于这太阳，故显而易见，这太阳是创造的首工，其它一切事物皆起源于它。我们说创造是由于这太阳，其实意思是由于藉着这太阳的主，因为这太阳也是主创造的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #152 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
152. I gave ample evidence in part 1 that everything in the universe was created by divine love and wisdom (see particularly <a href="52.htm" target=_top>52-53</a> [<a href="52.htm" target=_top>52-54</a>]). The point here is that this was done by means of the sun that is the first emanation of divine love and wisdom.<p>No one who can see how effects follow from causes and how causes lead to effects in due order and sequence can deny that the sun is the beginning of creation. Everything in our world is sustained by it, and because everything is sustained by it, everything arose from it--the one fact follows from the other and bears witness to it. Everything, that is, is watched over by the sun because the sun has determined its being, and the act of watching over it is an ongoing determination of that thing's being. This is why we say that being sustained is a constant coming into being. If anything were totally removed from the inflow of the sun through our atmospheres, it would instantly dissipate. It is the atmospheres with their different degrees of purity, empowered by the sun, that hold everything together. Since the universe and everything in it is sustained by the sun, then, we can see that the sun is the beginning of creation, the source.<p>We say "by the sun" but we mean "by the Lord through the sun," since the sun too was created by the Lord. </p>

152. We fully demonstrated in Part One, specifically in nos. <a href="52.htm">52-54</a>, that everything in the universe was created by Divine love and wisdom. We will now show here that it was done by means of the sun which is the first emanation of Divine love and wisdom.<p>No one who is capable of seeing effects from causes, and of seeing from causes then effects in their order and sequence, can deny that the sun is the first work of creation; for all things that exist in its planetary system are sustained by it, and because they are sustained by it, they also arose from it. The one fact points to and attests to the other. For all things are under the sun's gaze, because it established them to be so, and to keep them under its gaze is to establish them continually. That is why we also say that continued existence is a continual coming into existence. Moreover, if anything were to be totally removed from the sun's flowing in through the atmospheres, it would instantly disintegrate. For there are purer and purer atmospheres, which are actuated in their operation by the sun, and these hold all things together in connection. Now because the continued existence of the universe and everything in it is due to the sun, it is apparent that the sun is the first work of creation, from which springs all else.<p>We say it is due to the sun, but we mean to the Lord by means of the sun, for the sun, too, was created by the Lord. </p>

<p>
152. It was fully shown in Part I, especially in nos. 52, 53, that all things in the universe were created by the Divine Love and Wisdom. Here now it will be shown that it was by means of the Sun which is the first proceeding of the Divine Love and Wisdom. No-one who is capable of seeing effects from causes, and afterwards, from causes seeing effects in their order and sequence, can deny that the Sun is the first of creation, for all things in its world continue in existence from it. And because they continue in existence from it, they also come into existence from it. The one involves and declares the other. For all things are under the Sun's view because it has fixed them thus. And to hold under it, is to fix continuously, therefore it is said that continuing in existence is a perpetual coming into existence. Besides, if anything were withdrawn altogether from the Sun's influx through the atmospheres, that thing would instantly be dissolved, for the atmospheres which are more and more pure and are made potent from the Sun, hold all things in connection. Now because the continuing in existence of the universe and everything therein is from the Sun, it is clear that the Sun is the first of creation from which all things are. It is said from the Sun, but from the Lord by means of the Sun is understood, for the Sun also was created by the Lord. </p>

<p>
152. That all things in the universe were created by Divine Love and Divine Wisdom was fully shown in Part I., (particularly in n. <a href="52.htm" target=_top>52, 53</a>); here now it is to be shown that this was done by means of the sun, which is the first proceeding of Divine Love and Divine Wisdom. No one who is capable of seeing effects from causes, and afterwards by causes effects in their order and sequence, can deny that the sun is the first of creation, for all the things that are in its world have perpetual existence from it; and because they have perpetual existence from it, their existence was derived from it. The one involves and is proof of the other; for all things are under the sun's view, since it is determined that they should be, and to hold under its view is to determine perpetually; therefore it is said that subsistence is perpetual existence. If, moreover, any thing were to be withdrawn entirely from the sun's influx through the atmospheres, it would instantly be dissipated; for the atmospheres, which are purer and purer, and are rendered active in power by the sun, hold all things in connection. Since, then, the perpetual existence of the universe, and of every thing pertaining to it, is from the sun, it is plain that the sun is the first of creation, from which [is all else]. The sun is spoken of as creating, but this means the Lord, by means of the sun; for the sun also was created by the Lord. </p>

<p>
152. Quod omnia in universo a Divino Amore et a Divina sapientia creata sint, in Parte Prima plene ostensum est, in specie <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_152/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_52" target=_top>52-54</a> <sup>1</sup>
hic nunc quod medio Sole, qui est Primum procedens Divini Amoris et Divinae sapientiae. Nemo qui potest videre effectus ex causis, et dein a causis effectus in suo ordine et in serie, potest negare, quin Sol sit primum creationis, subsistunt enim ab illo omnia illa quae in ejus Mundo sunt; et quia subsistunt ab illo, etiam exstiterunt ab illo[;] unum concludit et testatur alterum, sunt enim omnia sub ejus intuitu, quia posuit ut sint, ac tenere sub illo est continue ponere; quare etiam dicitur, <sup>2</sup>
quod subsistentia sit perpetua existentia; si etiam aliquid subtraheretur prorsus a solis influxu per athmosphaeras, hoc illico dissolveretur; athmosphaerae enim, quae sunt puriores et puriores, et a Sole actuatae in potentia, omnia in nexu continent; nunc quia subsistentia universi et omnium ejus est a Sole, patet quod Sol sit <sup>3</sup>
primum creationis a quo. Dicitur a Sole, sed intelligitur a Domino per solem, nam sol etiam a Domino est creatus. <p>
