<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第158节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>158、由于自然界的太阳纯粹是火，因而是死的，所以它发出的热也是死的，它发出的光同样是死的；被称为以太和空气，并将那太阳的热和光揣在怀里带下去的大气亦是死的。由于这些东西是死的，所以大气之下、被称为土地的大地上的每一个事物都是死的；然而，每一个事物都被从灵界太阳发出并流入的属灵之物围绕。如果它们没有被如此围绕，土地就无法被激发活动，产生功用的形式，即植物；也无法产生生命的形式，即动物；从而无法供应人类开始并持续存在所需的各种物质。</p>

<p>
158. Since the physical world's sun is nothing but fire and is therefore lifeless, the warmth that emanates from it is also lifeless, and so is the emanating light. By the same token, the atmospheres called ether and air that receive this sun's warmth and light and bring them down into our embrace are lifeless as well. Since all these are lifeless, absolutely all the earthly things beneath them called soils are lifeless. However, they are all surrounded by spiritual realities that emanate and flow out from the spiritual world's sun. If they were not surrounded in this way, soils could not be activated to bring forth the forms of use called plants and the forms of life called animals, and they could not provide the substances that enable us to come into being and to survive. </p>

158. Since the sun of the natural world is nothing but fire and consequently lifeless, therefore the warmth emanating from it is also lifeless, and the light emanating from it, too, is lifeless. The atmospheres as well, which we call the ether and air, and which receive in their embrace and transmit the warmth and light of that sun, are lifeless.<p>Since these are lifeless, each and every one of the world's constituents which lie below and are called earths is also lifeless. Yet each and every one is nevertheless surrounded by spiritual forces which emanate and flow out from the sun of the spiritual world. If they were not surrounded by these forces, the elemental earths could not have been activated to produce forms of useful service, which are plants, nor forms of life, which are animals. Nor could they have supplied the materials which enable mankind to exist and endure. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #158 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
158. Since the sun of the natural world is pure fire and thus dead, therefore the heat proceeding from it is also dead, as the light proceeding from it is dead. Similarly the atmospheres which are called ether and air, and receive in their bosom and carry down the heat and light of that sun, are dead. Since these are dead, so each and all things of the earth which lie beneath and are called soils are dead. But yet each and all of these things are encompassed by spiritual things which proceed and flow forth from the Sun of the spiritual world. Unless they were so encompassed, the soils could not have been actuated and have produced forms of uses, which are vegetables, nor forms of life which are animals; nor could they have furnished matters by which man comes into, and remains in existence. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #158 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
158. As the sun of the natural world is pure fire, and therefore dead, the heat proceeding from it is also dead, likewise the light proceeding from it is dead; so also are the atmospheres, which are called ether and air, and which receive in their bosom and carry down the heat and light of that sun; and as these are dead so are each and all things of the earth which are beneath the atmospheres, and are called soils, yet these, one and all, are encompassed by what is spiritual, proceeding and flowing forth from the sun of the spiritual world. Unless they had been so encompassed, the soils could not have been stirred into activity, and have produced forms of uses, which are plants, nor forms of life, which are animals; nor could have supplied the materials by which man begins and continues to exist. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #158 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
158. Quoniam Sol Mundi naturalis est purus ignis, et inde ille mortuus, ideo etiam Calor inde procedens est mortuus, similiter Lux inde procedens est mortua: pariter Athmosphaerae, quae vocantur aether et aer, ac in sinu suo recipiunt et deferunt calorem et lucem Solis illius, sunt mortuae. Quoniam haec sunt mortua, sunt etiam omnia et singula telluris, quae subjacent, et vocantur terrae, mortua: sed usque omnia et singula circumcincta sunt spiritualibus, quae e Sole Mundi spiritualis procedunt et profluunt; a quibus nisi circumcincta forent, terrae non potuissent actuari, et producere formas usuum, quae sunt vegetabilia, nec formas vitae, quae sunt animalia; nec subministrare <sup>1</sup>
materias, per quas homo existat et subsistat. <p>
