<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">3.13 属灵之光能通过这三个层级流入人内，但属灵之热不能，除非人避恶如罪，并仰望主</h4><p>242、从前面所述明显可知，天堂的太阳就是主的神性之爱和神性智慧的首先发出(如第二部分所论述的)，光和热从它发出：光来自它的智慧，热来自它的爱；光是传送智慧的容器，热是传送爱的容器；人进入智慧到何种程度，就进入那神性之光到何种程度；进入爱到何种程度，就进入那神性之热到何种程度。从前面的论证还明显可知，光有三个层级，热有三个层级，也就是智慧的三个层级和爱的三个层级；这些层级在人里面得以形成，是为了使他能成为接受神性之爱和神性智慧、因而接受主的容器。此处要说明的一点是，属灵之光能通过这三个层级流入人内，但属灵之热不能，除非人避恶如罪，并仰望主。换句话说，人甚至能接受第三层级的智慧，但不能接受爱，除非他避恶如罪并仰望主。或换言之，人的理解力能被提升到智慧，但他的意愿不能，除非他避恶如罪。</p>

242. Spiritual light flows in within us through three levels, but not spiritual warmth except to the extent that we abstain from evils as sins and turn to the Lord. What I have presented thus far indicates that light and warmth emanate from the sun of heaven, that sun, described in part 2, that is the first emanation of divine love and wisdom. The light emanates from his wisdom and the warmth from his love. Further, the light is the vessel of wisdom and the warmth is the vessel of love; and the more we are engaged in wisdom, the more we come into that divine light, and the more we are engaged in love, the more we come into that divine warmth.<p>We can also tell from what has been presented that there are three levels of light and three levels of warmth, or three levels of wisdom and three levels of love, and that these levels are formed within us in such a way that we are open to divine love and wisdom and therefore to the Lord.<p>The present task, then, is to show that while spiritual light flows in through these three levels in us, spiritual warmth does not--except to the extent that we abstain from evils as sins and turn to the Lord; or what amounts to the same thing, to show that we can accept wisdom all the way to the third level, but not love--unless we abstain from evils as sins and turn to the Lord; or (what again amounts to the same thing) to show that our discernment can be raised up into wisdom, but our volition cannot be raised up [into love]--except to the extent that we abstain from evils as sins. </p>

242. Spiritual light flows in through the three degrees in a person, but not spiritual warmth except to the extent that the person refrains from evils as being sins and looks to the Lord. From what we have demonstrated previously, it follows that the sun in heaven is the first emanation of the Lord's Divine love and wisdom (as discussed in Part Two), and that from it emanate light and warmth - light from His wisdom, and warmth from His love; that light is the vehicle of wisdom, and warmth the vehicle of love; and that to the extent a person comes into wisdom, to the same extent he comes into that Divine light, and to the extent he comes into love, to the same extent he comes into that Divine warmth.<p>From what we have demonstrated previously it follows also that there are three degrees of light and three degrees of warmth, or three degrees of wisdom and three degrees of love, and that these degrees have been formed in people in order that people may be recipients of the Lord's Divine love and wisdom, thus of the Lord.<p>The point to be now demonstrated here is that spiritual light flows in through the three degrees in a person, but not spiritual warmth except to the extent that the person refrains from evils as being sins and looks to the Lord. Or in other words, that a person is capable of receiving wisdom even to the third degree, but not love except to the extent that the person refrains from evils as being sins and looks to the Lord. Or to put it in still other words, that a person's intellect may be elevated into wisdom, but not his will except to the extent he refrains from evils as being sins. </p>

242. SPIRITUAL LIGHT FLOWS IN WITH MAN THROUGH THREE DEGREES, BUT NOT SPIRITUAL HEAT EXCEPT SO FAR AS MAN SHUNS EVILS AS SINS, AND LOOKS TO THE LORD <p>From the things shown above it is established that from the Sun of heaven, which is the first proceeding of the Divine Love and Wisdom (which was treated in Part II), proceed light and heat, light from its wisdom, and heat from its love; also that light is the receptacle of wisdom, and heat the receptacle of love, and that so far as man comes into wisdom, so he comes into that Divine light, and so far as he comes into love, to that extent he comes into that Divine heat. It is also established from things shown above that there are three degrees of light and three degrees of love, and that these degrees have been formed in man that he may be a receptacle of the Divine Love and Wisdom, thus of the Lord. It is now to be shown that spiritual light flows in through these three degrees in man, but not spiritual heat except in so far as a man shuns evils as sins and looks to the Lord; or what is the same thing, that man is able to receive wisdom even to the third degree, but not love, unless he shuns evils as sins, and looks to the Lord; or what is still the same, that a man's understanding may be raised into wisdom, yet not his will except in so far as he shuns evils as sins. </p>

242. SPIRITUAL LIGHT FLOWS IN WITH MAN THROUGH DEGREES, BUT NOT SPIRITUAL HEAT, EXCEPT SO FAR AS MAN FLEES FROM EVILS AS SINS AND LOOKS TO THE LORD. <p>It is evident from what has been shown above that from the sun of heaven, which is the first proceeding of Divine Love and Divine Wisdom (treated of in Part Second), light and heat proceed - light from its wisdom, and heat from its love; also that light is the receptacle of wisdom, and heat of love; also that so far as man comes into wisdom he comes into that Divine light, and so far as he comes into love he comes into that Divine heat. From what has been shown above it is also evident that there are three degrees of light and three degrees of heat, that is, three degrees of wisdom and three degrees of love, and that these degrees have been formed in man in order that he may be a receptacle of the Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom, thus of the Lord. It is now to be shown that spiritual light flows in through these three degrees in man, but not spiritual heat, except so far as man shuns evils as sins and looks to the Lord - or, what is the same, that man is able to receive wisdom even to the third degree, but not love, unless he flees from evils as sins and looks to the Lord; or what is still the same, that man's understanding can be raised into wisdom, but not his will, except so far as he flees from evils as sins. </p>

242. <sup>1</sup>
QUOD LUX SPIRITUALIS INFLUAT PER TRES GRADUS APUD HOMINEM, SED NON CALOR SPIRITUALIS, NISI QUANTUM HOMO FUGIT MALA UT PECCATA, ET SPECTAT AD DOMINUM. Ex supra demonstratis constat, quod a Sole coeli, qui est primum procedens Divini amoris et Divinae Sapientiae, de quo in Secunda Parte actum est, procedat Lux et Calor, a Sapientia Ipsius Lux, et ab Amore Ipsius Calor; et quod Lux sit receptaculum Sapientiae, et Calor receptaculum Amoris; et quod quantum homo in sapientiam venit, tantum in Divinam illam Lucem veniat, et quantum in amorem, tantum in Divinum illum calorem. Ex supra demonstratis etiam constat, quod tres gradus lucis et tres gradus caloris sint, seu tres gradus sapientiae et tres gradus amoris, et quod illi gradus apud hominem formati sint, ut homo receptaculum Divini Amoris et Divinae Sapientiae, ita Domini, esset. Hic nunc demonstrandum est, quod Lux Spiritualis influat per tres illos gradus apud hominem, sed non Calor Spiritualis, nisi quantum homo fugit mala ut peccata, et spectat ad Dominum; seu quod idem, quod homo recipere possit sapientiam usque ad tertium gradum, sed non amorem, nisi fugiat mala ut peccata, et spectet ad Dominum; seu quod adhuc idem, quod Intellectus hominis elevari possit in sapientiam, non autem voluntas ejus, nisi quantum fugit mala ut peccata. <p>
