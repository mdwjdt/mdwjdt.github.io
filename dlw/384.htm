<h4 align="center"></h4><p>384、由于心智的一切都与意愿和理解力有关，身体的一切都与心和肺有关，所以头里面有两个脑半球，这两个脑半球就像意愿和理解力一样彼此不同。小脑主要是意愿的器官，大脑主要是理解力的器官。身体里面的心和肺同样与其它器官分开。它们通过隔膜分开，并被包裹在其称为胸膜的覆盖物中，它们形成身体中被称为胸的那一部分。身体的其余部分，被称为肢体、器官和内脏；在它们里面，这二者是结合在一起的。因此，这些部分成双成对地存在，如手臂和手，腰和腿，眼和鼻，以及体内的肾脏、输尿管和睾丸。即使不成对的器官也被分成左右两部分，包括脑本身分为两个脑半球，心分为两个心室，肺分为两个肺叶。此外，这些器官的右半部分与真理之良善有关，左半部分与良善之真理有关。或也可说，右半部分与产生智慧之真理的爱之良善有关，左半部分与爱之良善所产生的智慧之真理有关。由于良善与真理的结合是相互的，并且二者通过这种结合仿佛合而为一，所以人里面这些成对的部分在它们的功能、活动和感知上一起联合行动。</p>

384. Since all the elements of the mind have to do with volition and discernment and all the elements of the body with the heart and lungs, there are two brains in our heads, as distinct from each other as volition and discernment. The cerebellum serves volition primarily, and the cerebrum serves discernment primarily. In the same way, heart and lungs are distinct from everything else in the body. They are marked off by the diaphragm and enclosed in their own membrane, the pleura, forming the region of the body known as the chest.<p>These two aspects are found united in other parts of the body, the ones called members, organs, and viscera; so they too occur in pairs--arms and hands, legs and feet, eyes, and nostrils, for example. Within the body there are the kidneys, the ureters, and the reproductive glands; and the viscera that are not paired are still divided between right and left. Further, the brain itself is divided into two hemispheres, the heart into two ventricles, and the lungs into two lobes. The right side has to do with the good that results from truth and the left to the truth that results from good; or in other words, the right refers to the good that love can do, which leads to the truth of wisdom, while the left refers to the truth of wisdom that results from the good that love can do. Since the union of what is good and what is true is reciprocal, and since they become a virtual single whole by virtue of that union, these pairs within us act together as a unit in our deeds, motions, and sensations. </p>

384. Since all the mind's constituents are connected with the will and intellect, and all the body's constituents with the heart and lungs, therefore in the head the brain is divided into two structures, and these are as distinct from each other as the will and intellect from each other. The cerebellum serves primarily the will, and the cerebrum primarily the intellect.<p>In the body, the heart and lungs are likewise separated from the rest of the organs there. They are separated by the diaphragm and enveloped in their own covering, called the pleura, and they form that part of the body called the chest.<p>In the remaining constituents of the body, called its members, organs and viscera, these two elements are conjoined. Consequently the parts exist in pairs, such as the arms and hands, loins and feet, eyes and nostrils, and, inside the body, the kidneys, ureters, and testes. Even organs that do not exist in pairs are divided into a right and left side - including the cerebrum itself into two hemispheres, the heart itself into two ventricles, and the lungs themselves into two lobes. Moreover, the right side of these relates to the goodness of truth, and the left side to the truth of good. Or to say the same thing, the right side relates to the goodness of love from which arises the truth of wisdom, and the left side to the truth of wisdom arising from the goodness of love. Consequently, because the conjunction of goodness and truth is a reciprocal one, and by that conjunction they become as though one, therefore these pairs in the human being, too, operate together and conjointly in their functions, movements, and perceptions. </p>

384. Since all things of the mind have relation to the will and understanding and all things of the body to the heart and lungs so there are in the head two brains, each distinct from the other as is the case with the will and understanding. The cerebellum exists chiefly for the sake of the will, and the cerebrum chiefly for the understanding. Similarly the heart and lungs in the body are distinct from the rest of the organs there. They are separated from them by the diaphragm and are enveloped by a covering of their own, called the pleura, and form that part of the body called the chest. In the other parts of the body, that is, the members, organs and viscera, the will and the understanding are joined together, and thus also there are pairs; for example, arms, hands, loins, feet, eyes, nostrils; within the body, kidneys, ureters, testicles; and the viscera, which are not in pairs, are divided into right and left. Moreover, the brain itself is divided into two hemispheres, the heart into two ventricles, and the lungs into two lobes. The right of these relates to the goodness belonging to truth, and the left to the truth belonging to goodness; or what is the same, the right has relation to the goodness of love from which comes the truth of wisdom, and the left to the truth of wisdom which comes from the good of love. And because the union of good and truth is reciprocal, and by means of that union they become as it were one, the effect in man is that these pairs act together and jointly in their functions, movements, and sensations. </p>

384. Since all things of the mind have relation to the will and understanding, and all things of the body to the heart and lungs, there are in the head two brains, distinct from each other as will and understanding are distinct. The cerebellum is especially the organ of the will, and the cerebrum of the understanding. Likewise the heart and lungs in the body are distinct from the remaining parts there. They are separated by the diaphragm, and are enveloped by their own covering, called the pleura, and form that part of the body called the chest. In the other parts of the body, called members, organs, and viscera, there is a joining together of the two, and thus there are pairs; for instance, the arms, hands, loins, feet, eyes, and nostrils; and within the body the kidneys, ureters, and testicles; and the viscera which are not in pairs are divided into right and left. Moreover, the brain itself is divided into two hemispheres, the heart into two ventricles, and the lungs into two lobes; the right of all these having relation to the good of truth, and the left to the truth of good, or, what is the same, the right having relation to the good of love from which is the truth of wisdom, and the left having relation to the truth of wisdom which is from the good of love. And because the conjunction of good and truth is reciprocal, and by means of that conjunction the two become as it were one, therefore the pairs in man act together and conjointly in functions, motions, and senses. </p>

384. Quoniam omnia Mentis se referunt ad Voluntatem et Intellectum, ac omnia Corporis ad Cor et Pulmonem, ideo in Capite duo Cerebra sunt, et illa inter se distincta sicut sunt voluntas et intellectus inter se[;] Cerebellum est imprimis pro Voluntate, et Cerebrum imprimis pro Intellectu: similiter Cor et Pulmo in Corpore sunt distincta a reliquis ibi; distinguuntur per diaphragma, et circumteguntur proprio velamine, quod vocatur Pleura, <sup>1</sup>
et faciunt illud corporis quod vocatur Pectus. In reliquis Corporis, quae vocantur Membra, Organa, Viscera, sunt duo illa conjuncta, quare etiam sunt Paria, prout brachia et manus, lumbi et pedes, oculi, nares; in Corpore renes, ureteres, testes; et viscera quae non sunt paria, in dextrum et sinistrum divisa sunt; praeter ipsum Cerebrum in duo haemisphaeria, ipsum Cor in duos ventriculos, et ipse Pulmo in duos lobos; et dextrum eorum se refert ad bonum veri, et sinistrum ad verum boni, seu quod idem, dextrum se refert ad bonum amoris ex quo verum sapientiae, et sinistrum ad verum sapientiae ex bono amoris: et quia conjunctio boni et veri est reciproca, et per illam conjunctionem fiunt <sup>2</sup>
sicut unum, ideo etiam paria illa in homine una et conjunctim agunt in functionibus, motibus, et sensibus. <sup>3</sup>
