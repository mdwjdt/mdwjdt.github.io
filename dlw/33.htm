<h4 align="center"></h4><p>33、人的一切情感与思维皆由构成真正的本质，也就是神的神性之爱和神性智慧产生，情感由神性之爱产生，思维由神性智慧产生。此外，人的每一个组成部分无非是情感和思维；这二者就像人生命的一切的源泉。其生命的所有快乐和满足皆来自它们，快乐来自其爱之情感，满足来自出于情感的思维。由于人被造为一个接受的容器，并且是照着他爱神，和因对神的爱而变得智慧的程度而为一个接受的容器；换句话说，照着被那些来自神的事物所感动，并因这种感动而思考的程度而为一个接受的容器；故可知，神性本质，也就是造物主，就是神性之爱和神性智慧。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #33 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
33. All human feelings and thoughts arise from the divine love and wisdom that constitute the very essence that is God. The feelings arise from divine love and the thoughts from divine wisdom. Further, every single bit of our being is nothing but feeling and thought. These two are like the springs of everything that is alive in us. They are the source of all our life experiences of delight and enchantment, the delight from the prompting of our love and the enchantment from our consequent thought.<p>Since we have been created to be recipients, then, and since we are recipients to the extent that we love God and are wise because of our love for God (that is, the extent to which we are moved by what comes from God and think as a result of that feeling), it therefore follows that the divine essence, the Creatress, is divine love and wisdom. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #33 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
33. The Divine love and wisdom which form the very essence that is God are the origin of all the affections and thoughts in a person, his affections originating from Divine love, and his thoughts from Divine wisdom. Moreover, each and every constituent of the human being is nothing but affection and thought. These two are, so to speak, the wellsprings of all elements of his life. All the delights and satisfactions of his life arise from them, delights from an affection of his love, and satisfactions from his resulting thought.<p>Now because man was created to be a recipient vessel, and is a recipient vessel in the measure that he loves God and out of love for God becomes wise, which is to say, in the measure that he is affected by those things which are from God and so thinks from that affection, it follows that the Divine essence, as the creative cause, is Divine love and wisdom. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #33 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
33. From the Divine Love and Wisdom, which make the very Essence which is God, arise all the affections and thoughts with man, affections from Divine Love, and thoughts from Divine Wisdom. And each and all things of man are nothing but affection and thought. These two are like the founts of all the things of his life. All the enjoyments and pleasures of his life are from them, enjoyments from the affection of his love and pleasures from the thought therefrom. Now since man was created to be a recipient, and is a recipient in the degree in which he loves God, and out of love to God is wise, that is, in the degree in which he is affected by those things that are from God, and in the degree that he thinks from that affection, it follows that the Divine Essence, which is the Creator, is Divine Love and Wisdom. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #33 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
33. From Divine Love and from Divine Wisdom, which make the very Essence that is God, all affections and thoughts with man have their rise-affections from Divine Love, and thoughts from Divine Wisdom; and each and all things of man are nothing but affection and thought; these two are like fountains of all things of man's life. All the enjoyments and pleasantnesses of his life are from these-enjoyments from the affection of his love, and pleasantnesses from the thought therefrom. Now since man was created to be a recipient, and is a recipient in the degree in which he loves God and from love to God is wise, in other words, in the degree in which he is affected by those things which are from God and thinks from that affection, it follows that the Divine Essence, which is the Creator, is Divine Love and Divine Wisdom. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #33 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
33. Ex Divino Amore et ex Divina Sapientia, quae faciunt ipsam Essentiam Quae est Deus, oriuntur omnes affectiones et cogitationes apud hominem, affectiones ex Divino Amore, et cogitationes ex Divina Sapientia; et omnia et singula hominis non sunt nisi quam affectio et cogitatio; illae duae sunt sicut fontes omnium vitae ejus; omnia jucunda et amaena vitae ejus ex illis sunt, jucunda ex affectione amoris ejus, et amaena ex cogitatione inde. Nunc quia homo creatus est ut sit recipiens, et recipiens est quantum amat Deum, et ex amore in Deum sapit, hoc est, quantum afficitur illis quae a Deo sunt, et quantum cogitat ex affectione illa, sequitur, quod Divina Essentia, quae Creatrix, sit Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia. </p>
