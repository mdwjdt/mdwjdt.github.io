<h4 align="center"></h4><p>134、由于方位可以说被如此刻在天使和整个天堂上，所以和世人不同，天使无论往哪里去，都知道自己的家和居所。而人无法凭自己里面的灵界方位知道自己的家和居所，因为他从空间，因而从自然界的方位进行思考；自然界的方位与灵界的方位毫无共同之处。不过，鸟类和兽类却拥有这种知识，因为它们天生就本能地知道自己的家和巢穴，这从大量观察证据明显看出来；这些证据表明灵界就是这种情况。因为发生在自然界的一切现象都是结果，而发生在灵界的一切现象都是这些结果的原因。凡从属灵事物那里找不到其原因的属世事物都不存在。</p>

134. Since these regions are virtually written on each angel and on all of heaven, angels, unlike us in our world, know their homes and houses no matter where they travel. The reason we do not know our homes and houses instinctively, from their regions, is that we are thinking in terms of space and therefore in terms of this physical world's geography, which has nothing in common with the geography of the spiritual world.<p>However, birds and animals have this kind of knowledge by instinct. They know their homes and dwellings instinctively, as much experience testifies. This is a clue to the nature of the spiritual world, since everything that happens in the physical world is an effect and everything that happens in the spiritual world is a cause of such effects. Nothing happens in nature that does not have its cause in the spiritual realm. </p>

134. Since the zones are thus engraved, so to speak, on every angel, and on the whole of heaven as well, therefore an angel knows the location of his home and of his place of abode wherever he goes, unlike a person in the world. A person does not know the location of his home and place of abode from any interior orientation for the reason that he thinks in terms of space, thus in terms of the points of the compass in the natural world, which have nothing in common with the zones in the spiritual world.<p>On the other hand, birds and animals have this knowledge in them, for it is inborn in them to know the location of their homes and places of abode instinctively, as people know from a good deal of empirical observation - evidence that a like phenomenon is found in the spiritual world. For all phenomena that occur in the natural world are effects, and all phenomena that occur in the spiritual world are the causes of those effects. One does not find anything natural that does not have its cause from something spiritual. </p>

134. Since the quarters are thus, as it were, inscribed on the angel, and also on the whole heaven, therefore the angel, differently from a man in the world, knows his own home and dwelling-place, wherever he goes. Man does not know his home or dwelling-place from any quarter in himself because he thinks from space, thus from the quarters of the natural world which have nothing in common with the quarters of the spiritual world. But yet birds and beasts have such knowledge, for it is implanted in them to know from themselves their homes and dwellings, as is known from much experience, a proof that such is the case in the spiritual world. For all things which exist in the natural world are effects, and all things which exist in the spiritual world are the causes of these effects. No natural thing exists which does not derive its cause from the spiritual. </p>

134. Since the quarters are thus inscribed as it were on the angel, as well as on the whole heaven, an angel, unlike man in the world, knows his own home and his own dwelling-place wherever he goes. Man does not know his home and dwelling-place from the spiritual quarter in himself, because he thinks from space, thus from the quarters of the natural world, which have nothing in common with the quarters of the spiritual world. But birds and beasts have such knowledge, for it is implanted in them to know of themselves their homes and dwelling-places, as is evident from abundant observation; a proof that such is the case in the spiritual world; for all things that have form [existunt] in the natural world are effects, and all things that have form in the spiritual world are the causes of these effects. There does not take place [existit] a natural that does not derive its cause from a spiritual. </p>

134. Quoniam Plagae ita sunt Angelo, et quoque universo Coelo, quasi inscriptae, ideo Angelus scit domum suam et habitationem suam, ubicunque vadit, secus ac homo in mundo; causa quod homo non sciat domum et habitationem ex plaga in se, est quia cogitat ex spatio, ita ex plagis naturalis mundi, quae non commune habent cum plagis mundi spiritualis. At usque avibus et animalibus inest talis scientia, illis enim insitum est scire domos et habitationes suas ex se, ut notum est ex multa experientia; indicium, quod tale sit in spirituali mundo; nam omnia quae existunt in naturali mundo sunt effectus, et omnia quae existunt in spirituali mundo sunt effectuum illorum causae[;] naturale quod non trahit causam ex spirituali, non existit. </p>
