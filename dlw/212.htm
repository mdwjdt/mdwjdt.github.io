212. We can tell quite clearly that the final level is the composite, vessel, and foundation of the prior ones by looking at the way purpose and means progress to result. Enlightened reason can grasp the fact that the effect is the composite, vessel, and foundation of the means and the purpose, but cannot grasp as clearly the fact that the purpose in all fullness and the means in all fullness are actively present in the result, with the result being completely inclusive of them.<p>This follows from what has already been said in this part, especially from the fact that one level comes from another in a three-stage sequence and that a result is simply a purpose in its final form. Since the final form is this kind of composite, it follows that the final form is their vessel and also their foundation. </p>

212. That the last degree embraces, contains, and is the foundation of the prior degrees is clearly apparent from the progression of ends and causes to effects. Enlightened reason can comprehend that the effect embraces, contains, and is the foundation of its causes and ends, but it does not so clearly see that the end with all of its constituents, and the cause with all of its constituents, are actually present in the effect, so that the effect embraces them in their entirety.<p>That such is the case can be seen from what we have said previously in this part of the work, especially from the following, that one element follows after another in a threefold progression, and that effect is nothing but the end in its final form. Moreover, because the final form embraces the rest, it follows that the final form contains them and is also their foundation. </p>

<p>
212. That the ultimate degree is the complex, containant and base of prior degrees is manifestly obvious from progressions of ends to causes and effects. That the effect is the complex, containant and base of causes and ends can be comprehended by enlightened reason. But it is not so clear that the end with all things of it, and the cause with all things of it, are actually in the effect, and that the effect is their full complex. That such is the case can be established from things said in this Part, especially from these, that one thing is from the other in a threefold series; that the effect is nothing else than the end in its ultimate; and because the ultimate is the complex, it follows that it is the containant and also the base. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #212 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
212. That the outmost degree is the complex, containant, and base of prior degrees, is clearly seen from progression of ends and causes to effects. That the effect is the complex, containant, and base of causes and ends can be comprehended by enlightened reason; but it is not so clear that the end with all things thereof, and the cause with all things thereof, are actually in the effect, and that the effect is their full complex. That such is the case can be seen from what has been said above in this Part, particularly from this, that one thing is from another in a threefold series, and that the effect is nothing else than the end in its outmost. And since the outmost is the complex, it follows that it is the containant and also the base. </p>

212. Quod Gradus ultimus sit complexus, continens et basis graduum priorum, constat manifeste ex progressione finium et causarum ad effectus; quod effectus sit complexus, continens et basis causarum et finium, a ratione illustrata potest comprehendi; sed non ita clare, quod finis cum omnibus ejus, et causa cum omnibus ejus, actualiter sint in effectu, ac quod effectus sit plenus complexus eorum. Quod res talis sit, a praedictis in hac Parte constare potest, ex illis imprimis, quod unum sit ab altero in serie triplicata; et quod effectus non sit aliud quam finis in suo ultimo; et quia ultimum est complexus, sequitur quod ultimum sit continens, et quoque basis. </p>
