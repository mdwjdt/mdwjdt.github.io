413, 13. Because of the power given it by love, wisdom or discernment can be raised up, can accept things in heaven's light, and can grasp them. I have already and often stated that we can grasp hidden treasures of wisdom when we hear them. This ability of ours is what we call "rationality," and it is ours from creation. This ability to see into things deeply and to form conclusions about what is fair and just, about what is good and true, is what distinguishes us from animals. It is also what I mean by the statement that discernment can be raised up, can accept things in heaven's light, and can grasp them.<p>We can also see a kind of image of this fact in the lungs, since the lungs correspond to our discernment. Looking at the lungs, we see that their substance comprises little chambers. These consist of the extensions of the bronchia all the way into the tiny sacs where the air is taken in when we breathe. Our thoughts act in unison with them because of their correspondence. It is characteristic of the substance of these little sacs that it has two ways of expanding and contracting, one in unison with the heart and the other almost independent of the heart. Its unison with the heart is because of the pulmonary arteries and veins, which come directly from the heart. Its virtual independence is because of the bronchial arteries and veins, which come from the vena cava and aorta, vessels external to the heart. This happens in the lungs because our discernment can be raised above its own love, which answers to the heart, and accept light from heaven. Even so, when our discernment is raised above its own love it does not leave it completely behind. It takes along some of it, which we can call a desire for knowing and discerning for the sake of promotion, praise, or profit in this world. Some trace of this clings to each love like a coating. This gives the love a superficial glow; but for wise people, there is an actual translucence.<p>I cite these facts about the lungs to show that our discernment can be raised up and accept and grasp things in heaven's light. There is in fact a complete correspondence. To see from correspondence is to see the lungs reflected in our discernment and our discernment reflected in our lungs, and to find assurance in each at the same time. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #413 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>413. (13) By a power imparted to it by love or the will, wisdom or the intellect can be elevated so as to admit from heaven such matters as are matters of light and perceive them. We have already shown here and there above that a person can perceive the secrets of wisdom when he hears them. This faculty of the human being is the faculty called rationality, which everyone has from creation. It is the ability to understand matters interiorly and to draw conclusions regarding what is just and equitable and what is good and true, and it is this faculty that distinguishes the human being from animals. This, therefore, is what we mean by the statement that the intellect can be elevated and admit from heaven such matters as are matters of light and perceive them.<p> </p>
<p>[2] The fact of this can also be seen in a kind of reflected image in the lungs, because the lungs correspond to the intellect. It can be seen in the lungs from their porous substance, which consists of bronchial tubules terminating in tiny cavities that are the recipient vessels of air during respiration. These are the elements with which thoughts are united by correspondence. This spongy substance is such that it can be caused to expand and contract in a twofold mode, in one mode together with the heart, and in the other almost separate from the heart. It is caused to expand and contract in a mode synchronous with heart by the pulmonary arteries and veins, which extend only from the heart, and it is caused to expand and contract in a mode almost separate from the heart by the bronchial arteries and veins, which extend from the vena cava and aorta. These latter vessels lie outside the heart.<p> </p>
<p>[3] This is the case in the lungs because the intellect can be elevated above the native love which corresponds to the heart and admit light from heaven. But even when the intellect is elevated above the native love, it does not separate from it, but takes from it that element called an affection for knowing and understanding for the sake of some measure of honor, glory or material gain in the world. This objective in some measure clings to every love as an outer layer, from which love shines on the surface, but through which it shines in the wise.<p>We have cited these particulars regarding the lungs in order to corroborate the fact that the intellect can be elevated so as to admit and perceive such matters as are matters of the light of heaven, for there is between them a complete correspondence. To see them from the perspective of their correspondence is to see the lungs from the perspective of the intellect, and the intellect from the perspective of the lungs, and so to see from the two together a corroboration. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #413 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>413. (xiii) Wisdom or the understanding, from power given it by love, can be elevated, and can receive such things as are of light out of heaven, and perceive them. It has been shown in several places above that man has the power to perceive arcana of wisdom when he hears them. This faculty of man is what is called rationality and is the heritage of every man by creation. It is the faculty of understanding things interiorly and of forming opinions on what is just and right, and on what is good and true; and by it man is distinguished from beasts. This therefore is the meaning where it is said "the understanding can be elevated and can receive such things as are of light out of heaven, and perceive them." That this is so can be seen also in a certain image in the lungs, since the lungs correspond to the understanding. It may be evident in the lungs from their cellular substance, which is made up of bronchial tubes continued even to the minutest air-cells, which are receptacles for the air used in breathing; these are the things with which the thoughts act in conjunction by correspondence. This cell-like substance is such that it can be expanded and contracted in twofold fashion, in one with the heart, and in the other almost separate from the heart, in the former by arteries and veins which come from the heart alone, in the latter by the bronchial arteries and veins which come from the vena cava and aorta; these vessels are outside the heart. This takes place in the lungs because the understanding can be raised above its own particular love corresponding to the heart and can receive light from heaven. Yet when the understanding is raised above its own particular love, it does not go away from it, but derives therefrom an affection for knowing and understanding for the sake of some reward of honour, glory, or gain in the world. This quality clings to every love like a surface, on account of which love shines out to the surface, and with the wise shines through. These things concerning the lungs are brought forward to prove that the understanding may be elevated, and receive and perceive things that are of the light from heaven, for the correspondence is plenary. To see from correspondence is to see the lungs in accordance with the understanding, and the understanding from the lungs and so from both together to perceive proof. </p>

413. (13) Wisdom or the understanding, from the potency given to it by love, can be elevated and can receive such things as are of light out of heaven, and perceive them. That man has the ability to perceive arcana of wisdom when he hears them, has been shown above in many places. This capacity of man is called rationality. It belongs to every man by creation. It is the capacity to understand things interiorly, and to decide what is just and right, and what is good and true; and by it man is distinguished from beasts. This, then, is what is meant when it is said, that the understanding can be elevated and receive things that are of light out of heaven, and perceive them. That this is so can also be seen in a kind of image in the lungs, for the reason that the lungs correspond to the understanding. In the lungs it can be seen from their cellular substance, which consists of bronchial tubes continued down to the minutest air-cells, which are receptacles of air in respirations; these are what the thoughts make one with by correspondence. This cell-like substance is such that it can be expanded and contracted in a twofold mode, in one mode with the heart, in the other almost separate from the heart. In the former, it is expanded and contracted through the pulmonary arteries and veins, which are from the heart alone; in the latter, through the bronchial arteries and veins, which are from the vena cava and aorta, and these vessels are outside of the heart. This takes place in the lungs for the reason that the understanding is capable of being raised above its proper love, which corresponds to the heart, and to receive light from heaven. Still, when the understanding is raised above its proper love, it does not withdraw from it, but derives from it what is called the affection for knowing and understanding, with a view to somewhat of honor, glory, or gain in the world; this clings to every love as a surface, and by it the love shines on the surface; but with the wise, the love shines through. These things respecting the lungs are brought forward to prove that the understanding can be elevated and can receive and perceive things that are of the light of heaven; for the correspondence is plenary. To see from correspondence is to see the lungs from the understanding, and the understanding from the lungs, and thus from both together to perceive proof. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #413 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>413. XIII. Quod Sapientia seu Intellectus ex potentia sibi data ab amore [seu voluntate] possit elevari, ac recipere illa quae lucis sunt e Coelo, ac percipere illa. Quod homo possit percipere arcana sapientiae, dum audit illa, supra passim ostensum est; haec facultas hominis est quae vocatur Rationalitas, quae cuivis homini est ex creatione; per hanc facultatem, quae est facultas interius intelligendi res, et concludendi de justo et aequo, ac de bono et vero, homo distinguitur a bestiis; hoc itaque est, quod intelligitur per quod Intellectus possit elevari, et recipere illa quae lucis sunt e Coelo, et percipere illa.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Quod ita sit, etiam in quadam effigie videri potest in Pulmone, quia Pulmo correspondet Intellectui: videri potest in Pulmone ex substantia ejus cellulosa, quae consistit ex continuatis bronchiis usque ad folliculos <sup>1</sup>
minimos, qui sunt receptiones aeris in respirationibus; haec sunt, cum quibus cogitationes unum per correspondentiam agunt; substantia illa follicularis est talis, ut possit expandi et contrahi in duplici statu, in uno cum corde, et in altero paene separato a corde, in statu una cum corde, per arterias et venas pulmonares, quae ex solo corde sunt, <sup>2</sup>
in statu paene separato a corde, per arterias et venas bronchiales, quae ex vena cava et aorta sunt; haec vasa extra cor sunt:<p> </p>
<p>[3] hoc in Pulmone, quia Intellectus potest super amorem proprium, qui correspondet cordi, elevari, et recipere lucem e Coelo: sed usque dum Intellectus elevatur supra amorem proprium, non recedit ab illo, sed trahit ex illo id quod vocatur affectio sciendi ac intelligendi propter aliquid honoris, gloriae aut lucri in Mundo; hoc aliquid adhaeret cuivis amori sicut superficies, ex quo amor superficie tenus lucet, at apud sapientes translucet. Haec de Pulmone allata sunt, ut confirmetur, quod Intellectus possit elevari, ac recipere et percipere illa quae lucis coeli sunt, est enim plenaria correspondentia; ex correspondentia videre est ex Intellectu pulmonem, et ex Pulmone intellectum, et sic ex utroque simul confirmationem. <p>
