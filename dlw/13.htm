<h4 align="center"></h4><p>13、持有正确的神观何等重要，这可从以下事实看出来：神观构成凡有宗教信仰之人的思维至内层，因为宗教的一切和敬拜的一切都关系到神。由于无论普遍还是具体，神都在宗教和敬拜的一切事物中，所以没有一个正确的神观，与天堂的交流是不可能的。正因如此，在灵界，每个民族都照其“神是一位人”的观念而有其指定的地方；因为对主的观念就在这个观念，而非其它观念中。人死后的生命状态取决于他所确认的神观，这一事实从它的反面明显可知，即：对神的否认，以及基督教界对主之神性的否认构成地狱。</p>

13. We may gather how important it is to have a right concept of God from the fact that this concept is the very core of the thinking of anyone who has a religion. All the elements of religion and of worship focus on God; and since God is involved in every element of religion and worship, whether general or particular, unless there is a right concept of God there can be no communication with heaven. This is why every nation is allotted its place in the spiritual world according to its concept of a human God. This [understanding of God as human] is where the concept of the Lord is to be found, and nowhere else.<p>We can see very clearly that our state after death depends on our avowed concept of God if we consider the opposite, namely that the denial of God, and in the Christian world, a denial of the Lord's divinity, constitutes hell. </p>

13. How important it is to have a right idea of God can be seen from the fact that the idea of God forms the inmost element of thought in all who have any religion, for all constituents of religion and all constituents of worship relate to God. And because God is universally and specifically involved in all constituents of religion and worship, therefore without a right idea of God no communication with the heavens is possible. So it is that every nation in the spiritual world is allotted its location in accordance with its idea of God as a person; for in this idea and in no other lies an idea of the Lord.<p>The observation that a person's state of life after death accords with the idea of God he has affirmed in himself is clearly apparent from its antithesis, namely, that a denial of God forms hell - and in Christianity, a denial of the Lord's Divinity. </p>

13. How important it is to have a right idea of God can be established from this, that the idea of God constitutes the inmost of thought with all who have a religion, for all things of religion and all things of worship have respect to God. Also because God, universally and in particular, is in all things of religion and worship, so without a right idea of God, no communication with the heavens is possible. Hence it is that every nation in the spiritual world is allotted a place in accordance with its idea of God as a Man; for in this idea, and in no other, is the idea of the Lord. That a man's state of life after death is in accordance with the idea of God affirmed within himself is manifestly clear from its opposite, that the denial of God, and in the Christian world the denial of the Lord's Divinity, makes hell. </p>

13. How important it is to have a correct idea of God can be known from the truth that the idea of God constitutes the inmost of thought with all who have religion, for all things of religion and all things of worship look to God. And since God, universally and in particular, is in all things of religion and of worship, without a proper idea of God no communication with the heavens is possible. From this it is that in the spiritual world every nation has its place allotted in accordance with its idea of God as a Man; for in this idea, and in no other, is the idea of the Lord. That man's state of life after death is according to the idea of God in which he has become confirmed, is manifest from the opposite of this, namely, that the denial of God, and, in the Christian world, the denial of the Divinity of the Lord, constitutes hell. </p>

 13. Quanti interest justam ideam Dei habere, constare potest ex eo, quod idea Dei faciat intimum cogitationis apud omnes quibus est religio, omnia enim religionis et omnia cultus spectant Deum: et quia Deus universaliter et singulariter est in omnibus religionis et cultus, ideo nisi justa idea Dei sit, non potest communicatio dari cum Coelis: inde est, quod unaquaevis Gens in Mundo spirituali sortiatur locum secundum ideam Dei ut Hominis, in hac enim est idea Domini, et non in alia. Quod status vitae post mortem sit homini secundum ideam Dei apud se affirmatam, patet manifeste ab ejus opposito, quod negatio Dei faciat infernum; et in Christianismo negatio Divinitatis Domini. </p>
