<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第104节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>104、至于天使从中获得光与热的太阳，它出现在天使所居之地的上方，大约在四十五度仰角处，也就是处在中间高度，而且距离天使犹如自然界的太阳距离世人那样遥远。这太阳始终出现在那个高度并保持那个距离，从不离其本位。正因如此，天使没有划分为日和年的时间，也没有从早晨经过正午到傍晚和夜间的一天的任何进程；以及从春天经过夏天到秋天和冬天的一年的任何进程，而是有永恒的光明和永恒的春天。所以对天使来说，状态取代了时间，如前所述。</p>

104. As for the sun that is the source of angels' warmth and light, they see it at about a forty-five degree angle above the lands where they live, at a middle elevation. It also seems to be about as far from angels as this world's sun is from us.<p>They see the sun at that height and distance constantly; it does not move. This is why angels do not have stretches of time marked off into days and years or any daily progression from morning through noon to evening and on into night. They do not have a yearly sequence from spring through summer to autumn and on into winter, either. Instead, they have a constant daylight and constant springtime; which means that instead of "times" they have states, yas already noted [<a href="70.htm" target=_top>70</a>, <a href="73.htm" target=_top>73</a>]. </p>

104. So then, as regards the sun from which angels have their light and warmth, it appears at an elevation above the lands on which the angels dwell, at an altitude of about 45 degrees, which is a middle height. And it also appears as distant from the angels as the sun in the natural world does from people.<p>The spiritual sun appears at that height and distance constantly and does not move. So it is that for angels there are no intervals of time divided into days and years, nor any day's advance from morning through midday to evening and night. Neither do they experience the passing of a year from spring through summer to autumn and winter, but have perpetual light and perpetual spring. Consequently instead of periods of time they have intervals of state there, as explained above. <sup>1</sup>

104. As regards the Sun, therefore, from which the angels have light and heat, it appears above the lands on which the angels dwell at an elevation of about forty-five degrees, which is the middle altitude; it also appears at a distance from the angels just like the sun of the world from men. That Sun appears constantly at that altitude and at that distance, and does not move. Hence it is that the angels have not times divided into days and years, nor any progression of day from morning through mid-day towards evening into night, nor any progression of a year from spring through summer to autumn into winter. But there is perpetual light and perpetual spring. Wherefore, as was stated above, in place of times with the angels there are states. </p>

104. As regards the sun, therefore, from which angels have light and heat, it appears above the lands on which the angels dwell, at an elevation of about forty-five degrees, which is the middle altitude; it also appears far off from the angels like the sun of the world from men. The sun appears constantly at that altitude and at that distance, and does not move from its place. Hence it is that angels have no times divided into days and years, nor any progression of the day from morning, through midday to evening and into night; nor any progression of the year from spring, through summer to autumn, into winter; but there is perpetual light and perpetual spring; consequently, with the angels, as was said above, in place of times there are states. </p>

104. Quod itaque Solem, ex quo lux et calor est Angelis, concernit, apparet ille in elevatione a terris, super quibus habitant Angeli, circiter 45 graduum, quae est media altitudo; et quoque apparet distans ab Angelis, sicut Sol mundi ab hominibus. Sol ille in ea altitudine et in ea distantia apparet constanter, nec dimovetur: inde est, quod non sint Angelis tempora distincta in dies et annos, nec aliqua progressio diei a mane per meridiem ad vesperam in noctem; nec progressio anni a vere per aestatem ad autumnum in hyemem, sed est perpetua lux et perpetuum ver: quare loco temporum ibi sunt status, ut supra dictum est. </p>
