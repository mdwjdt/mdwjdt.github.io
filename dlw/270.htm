<h4 align="center"></h4><p>270、⑸一切邪恶，无论先天的，还是后天的，都在属世心智中占据一席之地。邪恶及其虚假在属世心智中占据一席之地，因为属世心智在形式或形像上就是一个世界，而属灵心智在形式或形像上是一个天堂，邪恶在天堂是没有立足之地的。故自出生起，属灵心智就没有打开，只具有被打开的潜能。此外，属世心智的形式部分源于自然界的物质，而属灵心智的形式只源于灵界的物质；属灵心智被主完整保存，以便人能成为人；因为人生来就是一个动物，不过，他能变成人。属世心智及其一切组成部分从右向左盘成螺旋形，而属灵心智从左向右盘成螺旋形。因此，这二者的旋转方向完全相反；一个证据是：邪恶在属世心智中占据一席之地，它本身就反对属灵心智。此外，从右向左旋转是向下的，因而朝向地狱；而从左向右旋转是向上的，因而朝向天堂。我从以下事实清楚看到这一点：恶灵只能从右向左转动身体，不能从左向右转动；而善灵很难从右向左转动身体，却很容易从左向右转动。他们的旋转与属于心智的内层的流动是一致的。</p>

270, 5. All evil characteristics and their consequent distortions, whether inherited or acquired, reside in the earthly mind. The reason evils and their consequent distortions reside in the earthly mind is that in form, or in image, this mind is an earthly world. The spiritual mind, though, is in form or in image a heaven, and there is no way for evil to find a welcome in heaven. So from birth, this latter mind is not open, only potentially so. The earthly mind derives its form in part from substances of the earthly world, but the spiritual mind derives its form solely from substances of the spiritual world. This latter mind is kept in its wholeness by the Lord so that we can become human. We are actually born animal, but become human.<p>The earthly mind, with everything in it, turns in spirals from right to left, while the spiritual mind turns in spirals from left to right. So the two minds are turning in opposite directions--a sign that evil is resident in the earthly mind and that on its own, it resists the spiritual mind. Further, turning from right to left is turning downward, toward hell, and turning from left to right moves upward, toward heaven. I have been shown this by the experience that evil spirits cannot turn their bodies from left to right, only from right to left, while good spirits find it hard to turn from right to left and easy to turn from left to right. Their turning follows the flow of the deeper levels of their minds. </p>

<p>270. (5) All evils and the falsities arising from them, both those inborn and those additionally acquired, have their seat in the natural mind. Evils and the falsities arising from them have their seat in the natural mind because that mind is in its form an image of the natural world, while the spiritual mind is in its form an image of heaven, and evil cannot be entertained in heaven. Consequently this latter mind is not open from birth, but has only the potential capability of being opened. The natural mind takes its form also in part from substances of the natural world, whereas the spiritual mind takes its form solely from substances of the spiritual world, substances which are preserved by the Lord in their integrity in order that a person may become human. For the human being is born an animal, but becomes human.<p> </p>
<p>[2] The natural mind with all its constituents is coiled into helixes spiraling from right to left, while the spiritual mind is coiled into helixes spiraling from left to right. Thus these minds turn in directions contrary to each other - evidence that evil has its seat in the natural mind, and that the natural mind of itself acts in opposition to the spiritual mind. The spiraling from right to left, moreover, is directed downward, thus toward hell, whereas the spiraling from left to right goes upward, thus toward heaven.<p>The fact of this has become apparent to me from the following observation, that an evil spirit cannot spin his body around from left to right, but only from right to left, while a good spirit can spin his body around only with difficulty from right to left, but easily from left to right. Their spinning around accords with the flow of the interior elements of their mind. </p>

<p>270. (v) All evils and consequent falsities, both engendered and acquired, have their seat in the natural mind. Evils and the consequent falsities reside in the natural mind, because that mind is, in form or image, a world, while the spiritual mind is, in form or image, a heaven, and in heaven evil cannot be entertained. Wherefore the spiritual mind has not been opened from birth but is only in the potentiality of being opened. The natural mind also derives its form in part from substances of the natural world, but the spiritual mind only from substances of the spiritual world. This mind is preserved in its integrity by the Lord so that man may become a man, for he is born an animal, but becomes a man. The natural mind with all its belongings is bent back into gyres from right to left, but the spiritual mind into gyres from left to right. Thus those minds are in contrary direction to one another-an indication that evil resides in the natural mind, and that from itself it acts against the spiritual mind. Further, the gyration from right to left is turned downwards, thus towards hell, but the gyration from left to right tends upwards, thus towards heaven. That such is the case was made clear to me by this experience, that an evil spirit can gyrate his body only from right to left, not from left to right, while a good spirit can gyrate his body from right to left only with difficulty, but with ease from left to right. The gyration follows the flow of the interiors which belong to the mind. </p>

<p>270. V. Quod omnia mala et inde falsa, tam ingenerata quam superinducta, in Mente naturali resideant. Quod mala et inde falsa in Mente naturali resideant, est quia illa Mens est in forma seu in imagine mundus, Mens autem spiritualis est in forma seu in imagine Coelum, et in Coelo non potest hospitari malum; quare haec mens a nativitate non est aperta, sed modo in potentia ut aperiri possit; Mens naturalis ducit suam formam etiam quoad partem a substantiis Mundi naturalis, sed Mens spiritualis solum a substantiis Mundi spiritualis, quae in sua integritate a Domino conservatur, ut homo possit fieri homo; nascitur enim animal, sed fit homo.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Mens naturalis cum omnibus ejus circumflexa est in gyros a dextro ad sinistrum, Mens autem spiritualis in gyros a sinistro ad dextrum; ita Mentes illae sunt in contrario versu ad se invicem; indicium, quod malum in Mente naturali resideat, et quod ex se agat contra Mentem spiritualem; ac circumgyratio a dextro ad sinistrum est versa deorsum, ita versus infernum, at circumgyratio a sinistro ad dextrum vadit sursum, ita versus Coelum: quod ita sit, patuit mihi ab hac experientia, quod malus spiritus corpus suum non circumgyrare possit a sinistro ad dextrum, sed a dextro ad sinistrum; spiritus autem bonus aegre potest circumgyrare corpus a dextro ad sinistrum, sed facile a sinistro ad dextrum; circumgyratio sequitur fluxum interiorum quae mentis sunt. </p>
