<h4 align="center"></h4><p>313、⑵一切功用的形式里面都有宇宙创造的某种形像。功用的形式有三种：矿物界的功用的形式、植物界的功用形式和动物界的功用形式。矿物界的功用形式无法描述，因为肉眼看不见它们。矿物界的第一种形式是构成大地的至微成分的物质和材料；第二种形式是这些至微成分的聚合物，它们具有无穷的多样性；第三种形式来自化成尘土的植物，动物尸体，以及它们持续不断的蒸腾物和散发物，这些事物添加到大地中，构成土壤。矿物界三个层级的形式在这一方面呈现出创造的形像，即：它们在太阳通过大气及其热和光的驱动下，产生形式上的功用，这些功用就是创造的目的。创造的这种形像就深藏于它们的努力中(对此，参看310节)。</p>

313, 2. In all such forms there is some image of creation. There are three kinds of forms of functions: forms of the functions of the mineral kingdom, forms of the functions of the plant kingdom, and forms of the functions of the animal kingdom. The forms of the functions of the mineral kingdom are beyond description because they are not open to our sight. The first forms are the material substances that make up the earth at their most minute. The second forms are compounds of these, which are infinitely varied. The third forms come from decayed vegetation and from dead animals, and from the gaseous vapors they are constantly giving forth, which combine with the earth to form its soil.<p>These three levels of the forms of the mineral kingdom offer an image of creation in that as they are activated by the sun through its atmospheres and their warmth and light, they do bring forth useful functions in particular forms, functions that are goals of creation. This image of creation in their tendencies (described in <a href="310.htm" target=_top>310</a> above) lies deeply hidden. </p>

313. (2) All forms of use have in them some image of creation. Forms of use are of three kinds: forms of use belonging to the mineral kingdom, forms of use belonging to the plant kingdom, and forms of use belonging to the animal kingdom.<p>Forms of use belonging to the mineral kingdom cannot be described, because they are not visible to the sight. Its first forms are the substances and materials of which the earth consists in its least constituents. Its second forms are aggregations of these, which are of infinite variety. Its third forms arise from plants that have decayed into dust, and dead animals, and from the continual evaporations and exhalations of these which combine with the earth and produce its soil.<p>These forms in three degrees belonging to the mineral kingdom present an image of creation in this respect, that actuated by the sun through the atmospheres and their heat and light, they produce useful ends in forms, ends which were the ends in creation. This image of creation lies concealed within their endeavors, as described above in no. <a href="310.htm">310</a>. </p>

313. (ii) In all forms of uses there is a certain image of creation. Forms of uses are of a threefold kind; forms of uses of the mineral kingdom; forms of uses of the vegetable kingdom; and forms of uses of the animal kingdom. The forms of uses of the mineral kingdom cannot be described because they are not visible to the eye. The first forms are the substances and matters of which the earth consists, in their minutest parts. The second forms are aggregates arising out of these, which are of infinite variety. The third forms come from plants fallen to dust, and from animal remains, and from the continual evaporations and exhalations of these which mix with earths and make the soil. These forms of the three degrees of the mineral kingdom in image resemble creation in this, that activated by the sun by means of the atmospheres and their heat and light, they produce uses in forms, which uses were the ends of creation. This image of creation lies deeply hidden within their conatus, (regarding which see above <a href="310.htm">310</a>). </p>

Forms of uses are of a threefold kind; forms of uses of the mineral kingdom, forms of uses of the vegetable kingdom, and forms of uses of the animal kingdom. The forms of uses of the mineral kingdom cannot be described, because they are not visible to the eye. The first forms are the substances and matters of which the lands consist, in their minutest divisions; the second forms are aggregates of these, and are of infinite variety; the third forms come from plants that have fallen to dust, and from animal remains, and from the continual evaporations and exhalations from these, which are added to lands and make their soil. These forms of the mineral kingdom in three degrees represent creation in an image in this, that, made active by the sun through the atmospheres and their heat and light, they bring forth uses in forms, which uses were creative ends. This image of creation lies deeply hidden within their conatus (of which see above, n. <a href="310.htm" target=_top>310</a>). </p>

313. II. Quod in omnibus formis usuum sit aliqua imago creationis. Formae usuum sunt triplicis generis, Formae usuum Regni mineralis; Formae usuum Regni vegetabilis; et Formae usuum Regni animalis. Formae usuum Regni mineralis non describi possunt, quia ad visum non apparent; primae formae sunt substantiae et materiae, ex quibus terrae, in suis minimis; secundae formae sunt congregationes ex illis, quae infinitae varietatis sunt; tertiae formae sunt ex vegetabilibus collapsis in pulverem, exque animalibus exstinctis; et ex evaporationibus et exhalationibus continuis illorum, quae se addunt terris, et faciunt humum illarum. Hae trium graduum formae Regni mineralis in imagine referunt creationem in eo, quod a Sole per athmosphaeras et earum calorem et lucem actuatae producant usus in formis, qui fines creationis fuerunt: haec imago creationis in conatibus earum, de quibus supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_313/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_310" target=_top>310</a>, recondita latet. </p>
