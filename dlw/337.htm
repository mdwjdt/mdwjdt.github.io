337. I will use the following sequence to show that good functions are from the Lord and that evil functions are from hell.<p>1. Which things in our world I mean by "evil functions."<p>2. Everything that is an evil function exists in hell, and everything that is a good function exists in heaven.<p>3. There is a constant inflow from the spiritual world into the earthly world.<p>4. The inflow from hell activates things that are evil functions, in places where there are things that answer to them.<p>5. The lowest spiritual level, separated from what is higher, is what does this.<p>6. There are two forms in which activation by inflow occurs, the plant form and the animal form.<p>7. Each form gets the ability and the means of propagating its own kind. </p>

337. We will demonstrate that good forms of use come from the Lord, and that evil forms of use come from hell, according to the following outline:<p>(1) What we mean by evil forms of use on the earth.<p>(2) All forms that are evil forms of use are found in hell, and those that are good forms of use in heaven.<p>(3) There is a continual influx from the spiritual world into the natural world.<p>(4) Influx from hell produces those forms which are evil forms of use in places where there are corresponding elements.<p>(5) The lowest spiritual plane separated from its higher one occasions this.<p>(6) The two kinds of forms into which influx operates are plant forms and animal forms.<p>(7) Each of these two kinds of forms receives the ability to reproduce its own kind and the means of reproducing it. </p>

<p>
337. That good uses are from the Lord, and evil uses from hell, will be shown in the following order: <p>(i) What is meant by evil uses on the earth, <p>(ii) All things that are evil uses are in hell, and all things that are good uses are in heaven, <p>(iii) There is a continuous influx from the spiritual world into the natural world, <p>(iv) Influx from hell brings about evil uses wherever there are such things as correspond to them, <p>(v) The lowest spiritual separated from what is above brings this about, <p>(vi) There are two forms into which the operation by influx takes place, the vegetable and animal forms, <p>(vii) Both these forms receive the faculty to propagate their kind, and the means of propagation. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #337 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
337. That good uses are from the Lord, and evil uses from hell, will be shown in the following order. <p>(1) What is meant by evil uses on the earth. <p>(2) All things that are evil uses are in hell, and all things that are good uses are in heaven. <p>(3) There is unceasing influx from the spiritual world into the natural world. <p>(4) Those things that are evil uses are effected by the operation of influx from hell, wherever there are such things as correspond thereto. <p>(5) This is done by the lowest spiritual separated from what is above it. <p>(6) There are two forms into which the operation by influx takes place, the vegetable and the animal. <p>(7) Both these forms receive the ability to propagate their kind and the means of propagation. </p>

337. Quod Usus boni sint a Domino, et quod usus mali sint ab Inferno, demonstrabitur hoc ordine. I. Quid super tellure intelligitur per usus malos. II. Quod omnia quae sunt usus mali, sint in Inferno, et quae usus boni in Coelo. III. Quod Influxus continuus sit e Mundo spirituali in Mundum naturalem. IV. Quod Influxus ex Inferno operetur illa quae usus mali sunt in locis ubi sunt illa quae correspondent. V. Quod ultimum Spirituale separatum a superiori suo id operetur. VI. Quod binae formae sunt, in quas operatio per influxum fit, forma vegetabilis et forma animalis. VII. Quod utraque forma facultatem propagandi suum genus, et propagationis media, accipiat. </p>
