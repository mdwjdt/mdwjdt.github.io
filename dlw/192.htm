<h4 align="center"></h4><p>192、由刚才所述明显可知，这些层级是同质的，也就是具有相同的特征和性质。肌肉的运动纤维，无论最小的，还是较大的、最大的，都是同质的。木纤维，从最小的到它们所形成的复合物，都是同质的。各种石头和金属的成分也是同质的。作为思维和情感之容器和居所的有机物质，从最简单的到形成大脑的整个复合物，都是同质的。大气，从纯净的以太到空气，都是同质的。跟随大气层级的热和光的系列层级是同质的，所以爱和智慧的层级也是同质的。特征和性质不同的事物是异质的，与同质之物不相合。因此，同质之物无法与它们结合形成离散层级，只能与同类结合来形成，因为同类具有相同的特征和性质，与它们是同质的。</p>

192. We can tell from what has just been said that these levels are consistent, of the same character and nature. The smallest, larger, and largest motor fibers of our muscles have the same basic nature. The smallest, larger, and largest nerve fibers match; the woody filaments match from their smallest forms to their compounds; and the parts of rocks and metals match in the same way. The organized substances that are vessels and dwellings of our thoughts and feelings match, from the very simplest to their overall compound, the brain. The atmospheres match, from pure ether to air. The levels of warmth and light that parallel those of the atmospheres in their sequence match; and therefore so do the levels of love and wisdom.<p>Things that are not of the same character and nature do not match and do not harmonize with things that do. This means that they cannot combine with them to make up distinct levels. They can combine only with their own kind, with things of the same character and nature, things that match. </p>

192. That these degrees are homogeneous, that is, of the same character and nature, follows from what we have now said. The minute, larger and largest motor fibers of the muscles are homogeneous. The minute, larger and largest nerve fibers are homogeneous. Wood fibers from the minute to their composite are homogeneous. So, too, are the constituents of stones and metals of every kind.<p>The organic substances which constitute the vessels and seats of thoughts and affections, from their simplest to the aggregated whole which forms the brain, are homogeneous. The atmospheres, from the pure ether to the air, are homogeneous. Degrees of heat and light in their succession according to the degrees of the atmospheres are homogeneous. And so also are degrees of love and wisdom homogeneous.<p>Things which are not of the same character and nature are heterogeneous, and they do not accord with things that are homogeneous. Thus they cannot form discrete degrees in combination with them, but only in combination with their like, with things that are of the same character and nature with which they are homogeneous. </p>

192. That these degrees are homogeneous, that is, of the same character and nature is evident from what has just been said. The motor fibres of muscles, least, greater and greatest, are homogeneous. Woody filaments from least things to their composite are homogeneous. Similarly are stony and metallic particles. The organic substances which are receptacles and abodes of thoughts, from simplest things to their general aggregate which is the brain, are homogeneous. Atmospheres, from pure ether to air, are homogeneous. Degrees of heat and light in series, according to the degrees of atmospheres, are homogeneous; and hence also degrees of love and wisdom are homogeneous. Those things which are not of the same character and nature are heterogeneous, and do not harmonize with homogeneous things; thus they cannot form discrete degrees with them, but only with their own which are of the same character and nature, with which they are homogeneous. </p>

192. That these degrees are homogeneous, that is, of the same character and nature, appears from what has just been said. The motor fibers of muscles, least, larger, and largest, are homogeneous. Woody filaments, from the least to the composite formed of these, are homogeneous. So likewise are parts of stones and metals of every kind. The organic substances which are receptacles and abodes of thoughts and affections, from the most simple to their general aggregate which is the brain, are homogeneous. The atmospheres, from pure ether to air, are homogeneous. The degrees of heat and light in series, following the degrees of atmospheres, are homogeneous, therefore the degrees of love and wisdom are also homogeneous. Things which are not of the same character and nature are heterogeneous, and do not harmonize with things homogeneous; thus they cannot form discrete degrees with them, but only with their own, which are of the same character and nature and with which they are homogeneous. </p>

192. Quod Gradus illi sint homogenei, hoc est, ejusdem indo lis et naturae, constat ex nunc dictis: fibrae motrices Musculorum, minimae, majores et maximae, sunt homogeneae; fibrae nerveae, minimae, majores et maximae, sunt homogeneae; filamenta lignea a minimis ad eorum compositum sunt homogenea: partes lapideae et metallicae cujusvis generis, similiter: substantiae organicae, quae sunt receptacula et habitacula cogitationum et affectionum, a simplicissimis ad congregatum commune, quod est Cerebrum, sunt homogeneae: Athmosphaerae a puro aethere ad aerem sunt homogeneae: Gradus caloris et lucis in serie secundum Gradus athmosphaerarum sunt homogenei; et inde quoque gradus amoris et sapientiae sunt homogenei. Illa quae non ejusdem indolis et naturae sunt, heterogenea sunt, et non concordant cum homogeneis; ita non possunt gradus discretos simul cum illis sistere, sed modo cum suis, quae ejusdem indolis et naturae sunt, cum quibus sunt homogenea. </p>
