<h4 align="center"></h4><p>308、当考虑到除了功用外，没有什么东西能从神造物主那里产生，从而被祂创造，并且要成为功用，它必须为了他人而存在时，谁不清楚地看出，功用是创造的目的？并且为自己的功用也是为他人，因为为自己的功用就是处于对他人有用的状态？凡想到这一点的人也能看出，真正系功用的功用，不会源于人，但必须从那个存在(从该存在产生的一切都是功用)，因而从主而存在于人里面。</p>

308. Can anyone fail to see quite clearly that the goals of creation are useful functions? Simply bear in mind that nothing can arise from God the Creator--nothing can be created, therefore--that is not useful. If it is to be useful, it must be for the sake of others. Even if it is for its own sake, it is still for others, because we are useful to ourselves in order to be fit to be useful to others. Anyone who keeps this in mind can also keep in mind the thought that functions that are truly useful cannot arise from us but must be in us from one who brings forth nothing but what is useful--the Lord. </p>

308. Who does not clearly see that the ends in creation are useful ends when he considers that nothing can come into being from God the Creator and so be created by Him except what is useful, and that to be useful, it must exist for the sake of others? Moreover, that usefulness to oneself is also usefulness to others, for to be of use to oneself is to be in a state to be of use to others?<p>Anyone who considers this can also consider that any useful endeavor that is truly useful cannot spring from mankind, but exists in mankind from Him from whom all that comes into being is of use, thus from the Lord. </p>

<p>
308. Who does not see clearly that uses are the ends of creation, when he considers that from God the Creator nothing can have existence and therefore nothing can be created except use? And that to be use, it must be for the sake of others? Also that use even for the sake of self must be for the sake of others, for use for the sake of self lies in being of use to others. He who considers this can also realise that use which is use cannot spring from man, but is in man from Him from Whom everything that comes forth is use, thus from the Lord. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #308 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
308. Who does not see clearly that uses are the ends of creation, when he considers that from God the Creator nothing can have form, and therefore nothing can be created, except use; and that to be use, it must be for the sake of others; and that use for the sake of self is also for the sake of others, since a use for the sake of self looks to one's being in a state to be of use to others? Whoso considers this is also able to see, that use which is use cannot spring from man, but must be in man from that Being from whom everything that comes forth is use, that is, from the Lord. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #308 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
308. Quod fines creationis sint usus, quis non clare videt, cum cogitat, quod a Deo Creatore non aliud possit existere et inde non aliud creari quam usus; ac ut usus sit, quod sit propter alios; et quod usus propter se etiam sit propter alios, nam usus propter se est ut in statu sit, ut sit usui aliis. Qui hoc cogitat, ille etiam potest cogitare, quod usus qui usus non possit existere ab homine, sed apud hominem ab Ipso, a quo omne quod existit est usus, ita a Domino. </p>
