<h4 align="center"></h4><p>178、之所以在此详述大气，水和陆地，是因为这三者是普遍成分，一切事物皆以无限的多样性通过并从它们取得自己的形式。大气是主动力，水是中间力，陆地是被动力，一切结果皆由此产生。这三种力如此在自己的系列中，唯因从显为太阳的主发出，并使它们活跃的生命。</p>

178. We speak of atmospheres, liquids, and solids here because these are the three basics through which and from which everything arises, with infinite variety. The atmospheres are active factors, the liquids intermediate factors, and the solids passive factors from which all results arise. The arrangement of three such factors in this sequence comes solely from the life that emanates from the Lord as the sun and enables them to be active. </p>

178. We speak here of atmospheres, bodies of water and lands, because these three are the general constituents through which and from which each and all things arise with infinite variety. Atmospheres are the active agencies, bodies of water the intermediate agencies, and lands the passive agencies from which all effects arise. These three in their succeeding order are such agencies owing solely to the life emanating from the Lord as the sun which causes them to be active. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #178 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
178. Atmospheres, waters and earths are here mentioned, because those three are the generals through and from which each and all things have existence with infinite variety. The atmospheres are the active forces, the waters are the middle forces and the lands are the passive forces from which all effects have existence. That those three forces are such in their series is solely from the life which proceeds from the Lord as a Sun, and which makes them active. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #178 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
178. Atmospheres, waters, and lands are here specified, because these three are generals, through and from which each and all things have their form [existunt] in infinite variety. The atmospheres are the active forces, the waters are the mediate forces, and the lands are the passive forces, from which all effects have existence. These three forces are such in their series solely by virtue of life that proceeds from the Lord as a sun, and that makes them active. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #178 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
178. Athmosphaerae, aquae et terrae hic dicuntur, quia illa tria sunt communia, per quae et ex quibus omnia et singula cum infinita varietate existunt; athmosphaerae sunt vires activae, aquae sunt vires mediae, et terrae sunt vires passivae, ex quibus omnes effectus existunt: quod illa tria tales vires sint in sua serie, est unice ex Vita, quae a Domino ut Sole procedit, et quae facit ut sint activae. </p>
