<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第272节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>272、鉴于许多人不知道邪恶的性质，也不知道它与良善是完全对立的，然而知道这一点很重要，因此我们按以下顺序阐述这个主题：<br><br>⑴陷入邪恶和由此而来的虚假的属世心智是地狱的一个形式和形像。<br><br>⑵属世心智作为地狱的一个形式或形像，通过三个层级下降。<br><br>⑶作为地狱的一个形式和形像的属世心智的三个层级，与作为天堂的一个形式和形像的属灵心智的三个层级是对立的。<br><br>⑷作为一个地狱的属世心智在各个方面都与作为一个天堂的属灵心智对立。</p>

272. Since most people do not know what evil is and how absolutely opposed it is to good, and since it is important to know this, I need to make this clear in the following sequence.<p>1. An earthly mind engaged in things evil and therefore false is a form and an image of hell.<p>2. An earthly mind that is a form and image of hell has three descending levels.<p>3. The three levels of an earthly mind that is a form and image of hell are the opposites of the three levels of a spiritual mind that is a form and image of heaven.<p>4. An earthly mind that is a hell is absolutely opposed to a spiritual mind that is a heaven. </p>

272. Now because many do not know the nature of evil and its complete opposition to good, and yet it is important for this to be known, therefore we are going to examine this subject under the following headings:<p>(1) The natural mind which is caught up in evils and their resulting falsities is a form of and image of hell.<p>(2) The natural mind which is a form of and image of hell descends through three degrees.<p>(3) The three degrees of the natural mind which is a form of and image of hell are opposed to the three degrees of the spiritual mind, which is a form of and image of heaven.<p>(4) The natural mind which is a hell stands in complete opposition to the spiritual mind, which is a heaven. </p>

272. Now because many do not know what the nature of evil is, and that it is entirely opposed to good, and as it is important for this to be known, therefore this matter is to be considered in this order: <p>(i) The natural mind which is in evils and consequent falsities is a form and image of hell. <p>(ii) The natural mind which is a form and image of hell descends through three degrees. <p>(iii) The three degrees of the natural mind which is a form and image of hell, are opposite to the three degrees of the spiritual mind which is a form and image of heaven. <p>(iv) The natural mind which is a hell is in everything opposed to the spiritual mind which is a heaven. </p>

272. Now as many do not know what the nature of evil is, and that it is entirely opposite to good, and as this knowledge is important, the subject shall be considered in the following order: <p>(1) The natural mind that is in evils and in falsities therefrom is a form and image of hell. <p>(2) The natural mind that is a form and image of hell descends through three degrees. <p>(3) The three degrees of the natural mind that is a form and image of hell, are opposite to the three degrees of the spiritual mind which is a form and image of heaven. <p>(4) The natural mind that is a hell is in every respect opposed to the spiritual mind that is a heaven. </p>

272. Nunc quia a multis nescitur quale est malum, et quod prorsus oppositum sit bono, et tamen interest ut sciatur, ideo haec res in hoc ordine lustranda est. 1. <sup>1</sup>
Quod Mens naturalis, quae in malis et inde falsis est, sit forma et imago inferni. 2. Quod Mens naturalis, quae est forma et imago inferni, descendat per tres gradus. 3. Quod tres gradus Mentis naturalis, quae est forma et imago inferni, sint oppositi tribus gradibus mentis spiritualis, quae est forma et imago Coeli. 4. Quod Mens naturalis quae est infernum, in omni opposito sit contra Mentem spiritualem quae est Coelum. <p>
