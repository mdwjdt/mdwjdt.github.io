<h4 align="center"></h4><p>380、血为红色也是由于心和血与爱及其情感的对应关系。因为灵界有各种颜色。红和白是基本色，其它颜色则从这两个基本色，以及它们的对立面，就是暗火色和黑色中获得变化。在灵界，红色对应于爱，白色对应于智慧。红色对应于爱，是因为它起源于灵界太阳的火，白色对应于智慧，是因为它起源于灵界太阳的光。由于爱与心存在一种对应关系，所以血必为红色，以表明它的起源。正因如此，在天上对主的爱掌权的地方，光是火红色的，那里的天使身穿紫衣；在天上智慧掌权的地方，光是亮白色的，那里的天使身穿白色细麻衣。</p>

380. It is because of the correspondence of the heart and blood with love and its feelings, too, that blood is red. There are all kinds of colors in the spiritual world, with red and white as the primary ones and the rest deriving their characteristics from these and from their opposites, which are a dark, fiery hue and black. Red corresponds to love there, and white to wisdom.<p>The reason red corresponds to love is that its source is the sun's fire; and the reason white corresponds to wisdom is that its source is the sun's light. Further, since love corresponds to the heart, blood needs to be red and to point to its source.<p>This is why the light is flamelike and angels wear reddish-purple in heavens where love for the Lord predominates, while the light is clear and angels wear white linen in heavens where wisdom predominates. </p>

380. The fact that the blood is red is owing also to the correspondence of the heart and blood with love and its affections. For the spiritual world has in it colors of every kind. The colors red and white are the fundamental ones, and the rest take their variations from them and from their opposites, which are a dark fiery color and black. The color red there corresponds to love, and the color white corresponds to wisdom.<p>The color red corresponds to love for the reason that it takes its origin from the fire of the sun in the spiritual world; and the color white corresponds to wisdom for the reason that it takes its origin from the light of the sun there. Because, then, there is a correspondence of love with the heart, therefore the blood cannot but be red and attest its origin.<p>It is in consequence of this that in the heavens where love toward the Lord reigns, the light is a flaming one, and the angels there are clad in purple garments; and in the heavens where wisdom reigns, the light is bright white, and the angels there are clad in garments of white linen. </p>

380. That the blood is red is also on account of the correspondence of the heart and the blood with love and its affections; for in the spiritual world there are colours of every kind. Red and white are the fundamental, and the rest derive their varieties from these and their opposites, which are a smoky fire shade and black. Red there corresponds to love, and white to wisdom. Red corresponds to love because it originates from the fire of the Sun there, and white corresponds to wisdom because it originates from the light of the same Sun; and because there is a correspondence of love with the heart, the blood cannot but be red, and indicate its origin. Hence it is that in the heavens, where love to the Lord reigns, light is the colour of flame, and the angels are clothed in purple garments; and in the heavens where wisdom reigns, the light is shining white, and the angels are clothed in white garments of fine linen. </p>

<p>
380. The redness, also, of the blood is from the correspondence of the heart and the blood with love and its affection; for in the spiritual world there are all kinds of colors, of which red and white are the fundamental, the rest deriving their varieties from these and from their opposites, which are a dusky fire color and black. Red there corresponds to love, and white to wisdom. Red corresponds to love because it originates in the fire of the spiritual sun, and white corresponds to wisdom because it originates in the light of that sun. And because there is a correspondence of love with the heart, the blood must needs be red, and reveal its origin. For this reason in the heavens where love to the Lord reigns the light is flame-colored, and the angels there are clothed in purple garments; and in the heavens where wisdom reigns the light is white, and the angels there are clothed in white linen garments. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #380 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
380. Quod sanguis rubeat, est quoque ex correspondentia cordis et sanguinis cum amore et ejus affectionibus: in spirituali enim Mundo sunt colores omnis generis[;] color ruber et albus sunt illorum fundamentales, ac reliqui ex illis et ex oppositis illorum, quae sunt igneum furvum et nigrum, trahunt suas varietates; color ruber ibi correspondet amori, et color albus correspondet sapientiae. Quod Color ruber correspondeat amori, est quia ex igne Solis ibi ducit originem, et quod color <sup>1</sup>
albus correspondeat sapientiae, est quia a luce Solis ibi ducit originem; et quia correspondentia est amoris cum corde, inde sanguis non potest non rubere, et indicare originem suam. Inde est quod in Coelis ubi amor in Dominum regnat, lux flammea sit, et angeli ibi induti sunt vestibus purpureis; et in Coelis ubi sapientia regnat, lux candida sit, et angeli ibi induti sunt vestibus albis byssinis. <p>
