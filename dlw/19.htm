<h4 align="center"></h4><p>19、神里面有无限事物，这一事实对天使来说，从他们所住的天堂更加显而易见。由数千亿天使构成的整个天堂，就其整体形式而言，就像一个人。天堂的每个社群，无论大小，也是如此。每位天使由此也是一个人，因为一位天使就是一个最小形式的天堂，这一点可见于《天堂与地狱》一书(51-86节)。无论作为整体、部分、还是个体，天堂由于天使所接受的神性而存在于这样一个形式中；因为天使照着接受神性的程度而为完美形式的人。正因如此，我们说天使在神里面，神在他们里面；还说，神是他们的一切。天堂到底有多少事物，无从得知；并且由于构成天堂的是神性，因而这些无法形容的众多事物来自神性，故清楚可知，正是在这个本质的人，也就是神里面有无限事物。</p>

19. The presence of infinite things in God is even more obvious to angels because of the heavens where they live. The whole heaven, made up of millions of angels, is like a person in its overall form. Each individual community of heaven, large or small, is the same; and therefore an angel is a person. An angel is actually a heaven in its smallest form (see <a href="../hh/51.htm" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 51-87</a> [<a href="../hh/51.htm" target=_top>51-86</a>]).<p>Heaven is in this form overall, regionally, and in individuals because of the divine nature that angels accept, since the extent to which angels accept the divine nature determines the perfection of their human form. This is why we say that angels are in God and that God is in them, and that God is everything to them.<p>The multiplicity of heaven is indescribable; and since it is Divinity that makes heaven, and therefore Divinity is the source of that indescribable multiplicity, we can see quite clearly that there are infinite things in that quintessential Person who is God. </p>

19. That there are infinite elements in God is more clearly apparent to angels from the heavens in which they dwell. The whole of heaven, which consists of millions of angels, is in the entirety of its form as though a single person. So, too, every society in heaven, both greater and smaller. For that reason also every angel is a person, for an angel is a heaven in miniature form. (That this is the case may be seen in the book Heaven and Hell, nos. <a href="../hh/51.htm">51-87</a>.)<p>Heaven in its entirety, in its component parts, and in its individual inhabitants exists in such a form because of the Divine character that angels receive; for in the measure of the Divine character he receives an angel is a person in perfect form. So it is that angels are said to be in God, and God in them, and that God is their all.<p>How many things exist in heaven cannot be described. And because the Divine is what forms heaven, and these inexpressibly many things are consequently from the Divine, it is clearly apparent that there are infinite elements in the supreme person who is God. </p>

19. It is more manifestly evident to the angels from the heavens in which they are that there are infinite things in God. The whole heaven consisting of myriads of myriads of angels is, in its universal form, like a man, likewise each society of heaven, be it larger or smaller. Hence also an angel is a man, for an angel is heaven in least form. That such is the case may be seen in the work HEAVEN AND HELL (<a href="../hh/51.htm">51-87</a>). Heaven as a whole, in part and in the individual, is in such a form from the Divine which the angels receive; for to the extent that an angel receives from the Lord, to that extent he is a man in perfect form. Thus it is that the angels are said to be in God and God in them; also that God is their all. It cannot be described how many things there are in heaven. And because the Divine makes heaven, it is clearly evident that there are infinite things in Very Man Who is God. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #19 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
19. That in God there are infinite things, is still more evident to the angels from the heavens in which they dwell. The whole heaven, consisting of myriads of myriads of angels, in its universal form is like a man. So is each society of heaven, be it larger or smaller. From this, too, an angel is a man, for an angel is a heaven in least form. (This is shown in the work Heaven and Hell, n. <a href="../hh/51.htm" target=_top>51-86</a>.) Heaven as a whole, in part, and in the individual, is in that form by virtue of the Divine which angels receive; for in the measure in which an angel receives from the Divine is he in complete form a man. From this it is that angels are said to be in God, and God in them; also, that God is their all. How many things there are in heaven cannot be told; and because the Divine is what makes heaven, and consequently these unspeakably many things are from the Divine, it is clearly evident that there are infinite things in Very Man, who is God. </p>

<p>
19. Quod Infinita in Deo sint, patet manifestius Angelis ex Coelis in quibus sunt; universum Coelum, quod ex myriadibus myriadum Angelorum consistit, in universali sua forma est sicut Homo; unaquaevis societas Coeli tam major quam minor similiter; inde etiam Angelus est homo, est enim Angelus coelum in minima forma; quod ita sit, videatur in Opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_19/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_51" target=_top>de COELO ET INFERNO 51-87</a>. In tali forma est Coelum in toto, parte et individuo, ex Divino quod Angeli recipiunt, nam quantum Angelus ex Divino recipit, tantum in perfecta forma homo est: inde est, quod Angeli dicantur in Deo esse, et Deus in illis, tum quod Deus sit omne illorum. Quam multa sunt in Coelo, non describi potest; et quia Divinum facit Coelum, et inde illa ineffabilia multa ex Divino sunt, clare patet, quod Infinita in Ipso Homine, qui est Deus, sint. </p>
