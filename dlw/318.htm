<h4 align="center"></h4><p>318、⑷一切功用的形式里面都有无限和永恒的某种形像。在这些形式中，无限的形像从它们充满全世界、甚至多个世界直至无限的一切空间清楚看出来。因为一粒种子会长成占据自己空间的一棵树，灌木或庄稼。每棵树，灌木或庄稼又能产出更多种子，有时产出成千上万粒，这些种子被播种并发芽后也会占据自己的空间。如果每粒种子都产出更多种子；当这些种子被播种并长大时，它们各自又占据自己的空间。如果它们当中的每一粒种子一次又一次地繁殖出同样多的新后代，那么几年之内它们就会填满整个世界；倘若继续繁殖下去，它们就会填满多个世界，直至无限。估算一下，一粒种子产出千粒，千粒又产出千粒乘千粒，如此十倍、二十部甚至百倍繁殖下去会有多少，你就会明白。一个永恒的类似形像就存在于这些形式里面；种子年年繁殖，并且这种繁殖永不停止；自创世直到如今，它们从未停止过，并永不停止。这两个特征是宇宙万物由一位无限和永恒的神创造的永久证据和见证标志。<br><br>除了这些无限和永恒的形像外，事物的多样性里面也有一种无限和永恒的形像，因为受造宇宙中永远不会有两样完全相同的物质、状态或事物，在大气、大地和由它们所产生的形式中也不会有。因此，在充满宇宙的任何一样事物中永远不会产出完全相同的事物。这一事实在人类面部特征的多样性中是显而易见的；纵然走遍全世界，也找不出两张完全相同的面孔，永远不可能找到。因此，任何心智都是与众不同的，因为脸是心智的形像。</p>

318, 4. In all such forms there is some image of what is infinite and eternal. We can see an image of the infinite in these forms from the tendency and potentiality of filling the space of the whole world and even of many worlds, without end. A single seed brings forth a tree, shrub, or plant that takes up its own space. From each tree, shrub, or plant, there come seeds, in some cases thousands of them. Assuming these to be planted and to have sprouted, they take up their spaces; and if from each of their seeds new generations arise again and again, after a few years the whole world is full. If the propagation continues, any number of worlds is filled, and so on to infinity. Figure on a thousand seeds coming from one, and then multiply a thousand by a thousand ten or twenty or a hundred times, and you will see.<p>There is a similar image of eternity in these processes. Seeds reproduce year after year, and the reproductions never cease. They have not paused from the creation of the world to the present, and they will not stop forever.<p>These two facts are obvious indications and eloquent signs that everything in the universe was created by an infinite and eternal God.<p>In addition to these images of what is infinite and eternal, there is another image in variety. There can never be a substance, state, or thing in the created universe that is exactly the same as any other. Not in the atmospheres, not on earth, not in the forms that arise from them, and therefore not in any of the things that fill the universe can anything identical ever be brought forth. We can see this very clearly in the variety of all human faces. There is not one identical to another in all the world, and never can be to eternity. This means that there is no human spirit like another, since the face bears the stamp of the spirit. </p>

<p>318. (4) All forms of use have in them some image of the Infinite and Eternal. An image of the Infinite is visible in these forms from their endeavor and power to fill every interval of space in the entire world and in many other worlds as well to infinity. For a single seed produces a tree, bush, or plant, which occupies its own space. Every tree, bush, or plant then produces more seeds - in some cases several thousand - and when these fall to the ground and sprout, they each occupy their own space. If every one of their seeds, then, were to spawn as many new progeny again and again, within years they would fill the whole world; and if they were to continue still to reproduce, they would fill many more worlds, and this to infinity. Reckon from one seed thousands more, and multiply those thousands by the thousands from them ten times, twenty times, up to a hundred times, and you will see.<p>An image of the Eternal exists similarly in these forms as well. Seeds are produced anew from year to year, and new productions of them never cease. They have not ceased from the creation of the world to this day, nor will they cease to eternity.<p>These two characteristics are manifest indications and testifying signs that all constituents of the universe have been created by an infinite and eternal God.<p> </p>
<p>[2] In addition to these images of the Infinite and Eternal, there is a further image of the Infinite and Eternal in the varieties of things and the fact that no substance, state, or object can ever occur in the created universe that is identical to another. Not in the atmospheres, not in the substances of the earth, nor in the forms arising from them, thus not in any of the constituents which fill the universe, can anything identical to another be produced to eternity.<p>The fact of this is visibly apparent in the variety of facial features among all human beings. No one set of facial features is identical to that of another anywhere in the world, nor can there be to eternity. Consequently neither is any mind the same, of which the face is a reflection. </p>

<p>318. (iv) In all forms of uses there is a certain image of the Infinite and the Eternal. The image of the Infinite in these forms is plain from their conatus and power to fill the spaces of the whole world, and even of many worlds, to infinity. For from one seed is produced a tree, shrub or plant which fills its own space. And from this tree, shrub or plant seeds are produced, in some cases thousands of them which, when sown and germinated, fill their own spaces. And if from each of their seeds there should come forth as many more, reproduced again and again, in the course of years the whole world would be filled. And if the productions were still continued, many worlds would be filled, and this to infinity. Estimate a thousand seeds from one and multiply thousands by thousands, ten times, twenty times, a hundred times, and you will see. The image of the Eternal in these forms is similar. Seeds are propagated from year to year, and propagations never cease. They have not ceased from the creation of the world till now, and will not cease to eternity. These two facts are outstanding indications and witnessing signs that all things of the universe have been created by an Infinite and Eternal God. Besides these images of the Infinite and Eternal, there is a further image of the Infinite and Eternal in varieties, in that there can never be a substance, state or thing in the created universe the same as another, neither in the atmospheres, nor in earths nor in the forms arising out of these, thus not in any of the things which fill the universe, can anything identical be produced to eternity. This is outstandingly observable in the variety of faces of mankind. No one face can be found throughout the world the same as another, nor can there be such to eternity. Consequently, no one mind is the same as another, for the face is the image of the mind. </p>

318. (4) In all forms of uses there is a kind of image of the Infinite and the Eternal. The image of the Infinite in these forms is plain from their conatus and power to fill the spaces of the whole world, and even of many worlds, to infinity. For a single seed produces a tree, shrub, or plant, which fills its own space; and each tree, shrub, or plant produces seeds, in some cases thousands of them, which, when sown and grown up, fill their own spaces; and if from each seed of these there should proceed as many more, reproduced again and again, in the course of years the whole world would be filled; and if the production were still continued many worlds would be filled; and this to infinity. Estimate a thousand seeds from one, and multiply the thousand by a thousand ten times, twenty times, even to a hundred times, and you will see. There is a like image of the Eternal in these forms; seeds are propagated from year to year, and the propagations never cease; they have not ceased from the creation of the world till now, and will not cease to eternity. These two are standing proofs and attesting signs that all things of the universe have been created by an Infinite and Eternal God. Beside these images of the Infinite and Eternal, there is another image of the Infinite and Eternal in varieties, in that there can never be a substance, state, or thing in the created universe the same as or identical with any other, neither in atmospheres, nor in lands, nor in the forms arising out of these. Thus not in any of the things which fill the universe can any thing the same be produced to eternity. This is plainly to be seen in the variety of the faces of human beings; no one face can be found throughout the world which is the same as another, nor can there be to all eternity, consequently not one mind, for the face is the type of the mind. </p>

<p>318. IV. Quod in omnibus formis usuum sit aliqua imago Infiniti et Aeterni. Imago Infiniti in illis formis patet a conatu et potentia implendi spatia universi orbis et quoque plurium orbium, in infinitum; ex uno enim semine producitur arbor, virgultum, aut planta, quae suum spatium implet[;] ex quavis arbore, virgulto aut planta producuntur <sup>1</sup>
semina, ex quibusdam ad aliquot millia, quae sata et egerminata sua spatia implent, et si ex quovis semine illorum totidem nova producta iterum et iterum existerent, intra annos impleretur totus orbis, et si adhuc productiones continuarentur, implerentur plures orbes, et hoc in infinitum; computa ex uno semine millia, et subduc millia in millia decies, vigesies, ad centies, ac videbis. Imago Aeterni etiam similis in illis est; semina ab anno in annum propagantur, et propagationes nusquam desinunt[;] non a creatione Mundi huc usque desierunt, nec desinent <sup>2</sup>
in aeternum. Haec bina sunt exstantia indicia et testantia signa quod omnia Universi a Deo Infinito ac Aeterno creata sint.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Praeter has imagines Infiniti et Aeterni, est adhuc imago Infiniti et Aeterni in varietatibus, quod nusquam dari queat substantia, status aut res in universo creato eadem seu idem cum altero[;] non in athmosphaeris, non in terris, nec in formis oriundis ex illis, ita non in ullis quae implent universum, potest aliquid idem in aeternum produci: hoc exstanter perspicitur in varietate facierum omnium hominum, quod non una eadem detur in universo terrarum orbe, et quod nec una eadem possit dari in aeternum; consequenter non idem animus, cujus typus est facies. <p>
