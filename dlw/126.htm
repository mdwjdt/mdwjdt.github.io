<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第126节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>126、对爱与智慧的这种接受的多样性造成了灵界的方位，这一点可从以下事实看出来：天使照着他里面爱的增多或减少而改变方位。由此清楚可知，方位并非取决于显为太阳的主，而是取决于天使，照其接受而定。就其灵而言，人也一样。事实上，就其灵而言，人就在灵界的某个方位，无论他在自然界处于哪个方位。因为如前所述，灵界的方位和自然界的方位毫无共同之处。人就其身体而言在自然界，就其灵而言在灵界。</p>

<p>
126. It makes sense that a particular openness to love and wisdom establishes a region in the spiritual world, given the fact that angels change their location in response to any increase or decrease of love in them. We can see from this that the location is not caused by the Lord as the sun but by angels, according to their receptivity.<p>The same holds true for us as far as our spirits are concerned. In spirit, each of us is in some particular region of the spiritual world no matter where we may be in the physical world. That is, the regions of the spiritual world have nothing in common with those of the physical world, as already stated [<a href="120.htm" target=_top>120</a>]. We are in the one as to body and in the other as to spirit. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #126 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
126. That their varying reception of love and wisdom determines what zone angels are in the spiritual world can be seen from the fact that an angel changes zones according to the increase or decrease of love in him. This in turn makes it clear that the zone is not determined by the Lord as the sun, but by the angel in accordance with his reception.<p>The case is the same with a person in respect to his spirit. In respect to his spirit he is in this or that zone in the spiritual world, no matter what region he is in in the natural world. For as we said above, the zones in the spiritual world have nothing in common with zones in the natural world. A person resides in the latter in respect to his body, but in the first in respect to his spirit. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #126 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
126. That the varying reception of love and wisdom determines the quarter in the spiritual world can be established from the fact that an angel changes his quarter according to the increase and decrease of love with him. From this it is clear that the quarter is not from the Lord as the Sun but from the angel according to reception. It is the same with man as to his spirit. As regards his spirit he is in a certain quarter of the spiritual world whatever quarter of the natural world he is in, for as said above, the quarters of the spiritual world have nothing in common with quarters in the natural world. Man is in the latter as regards his body, but in the former as regards his spirit. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #126 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
126. That this variety of reception of love and wisdom is what gives rise to the quarters in the spiritual world can be seen from the fact that an angel changes his quarter according to the increase or decrease of love with him; from which it is evident that the quarter is not from the Lord as a sun, but from the angel according to reception. It is the same with man as regards his spirit. In respect to his spirit, he is in some quarter of the spiritual world, whatever quarter of the natural world he may be in, for quarters in the spiritual world, as has been said above, have nothing in common with quarters in the natural world. Man is in the latter as regards his body, but in the former as regards his spirit. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #126 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
126. Quod varia receptio amoris et sapientiae faciat plagam in Mundo spirituali, constare potest ex eo, quod Angelus mutet plagam secundum incrementum et decrementum amoris apud illum; ex quo patet, quod Plaga non sit a Domino ut Sole, sed quod sit ab Angelo secundum receptionem. Simile est cum homine quoad spiritum ejus[;] ille quoad spiritum est in quadam plaga Mundi spiritualis, in quacunque plaga Mundi naturalis sit, nam ut supra dictum est, plagae Mundi spiritualis non commune habent cum plagis Mundi naturalis[;] in his est homo quoad corpus, in illis autem quoad spiritum. </p>
