<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">3.15 就本身而言，人类心智的属世层级是连续的，但因着与两个更高层级的对应关系，当被提升时，它看似被分成各个层次</h4><p>256、尽管这一点很难被那些尚不了解高度层级的人理解，但它必须被揭示出来，因为它是天使智慧的一部分；而属世人无法像天使那样思想这种智慧，然而仍能被他的理解力所领悟，只要这理解力被提升到天使所在之光的那个层级。因为他的理解力能被提升到那种程度，并照着这种提升而被光照。但属世心智的这种光照不是通过离散层级上升，而是通过一种连续层级增加，并且随着它的增加，属世心智从里面被两种更高层级的光光照。从对一个在另一个之上的高度层级的一种理解能明白这一切是如何发生的；而属世层级，也就是最低层，是这两种更高层级的一种覆盖层。然后，随着属世层级被提升向更高种类的层级，更高层就从里面作用于外在的属世层，并光照它。这种光照的确从里面通过更高层级的光实现，然而包裹并围绕更高层的属世层级却通过连续性接受它，因而随着它上升而更透明、更纯粹；也就是说，属世层级从里面被更高层级的光光照是离散式的，但本身被光照是连续式的。由此清楚可知，只要人活在世上，由此而处于属世层级，他就无法被提升到诸如天使所拥有的那种真正智慧中，只能被提升到更高的光中，甚至被提升到天使那里，并能从他们那从里面流入并进行光照的光中获得光照。不过，这些事目前还无法更清楚地被描述。通过结果可以更好地理解它们，因为结果将自己里面的原因呈现在光中，并因此光照它们，前提是对原因有一些了解。</p>

256. In its own right, the earthly level of the human mind is a continuum, but because of its responsiveness to the two higher levels, it seems to have distinct levels when it is raised up. Even though it is hard for people to understand this if they are not yet familiar with vertical levels, it still needs to be disclosed, since it is a matter of angelic wisdom. While earthly-minded people cannot think about this wisdom the way angels do, they can still grasp it mentally if their minds are raised into the level of light that angels enjoy. Our minds can actually be raised that far and enlightened accordingly. However, this enlightenment of our earthly minds does not happen by distinct levels. There is instead a gradual increase, and in keeping with that increase, our minds are enlightened from within, with the light of the two higher levels.<p>We can understand how this happens by perceiving that for vertical levels, one is above the other, with the earthly level, the terminal one, acting like an inclusive membrane for the two higher levels. As the earthly level is raised toward a higher level, then, the higher activates that outer earthly level from within and enlightens it. The enlightenment is actually happening because of the light of the higher levels from within, but it is received gradually by the earthly level that envelops and surrounds them, with greater clarity and purity as it ascends. That is, the earthly level is enlightened from within, from the light of the higher, distinct levels; but on the earthly level itself, it happens gradually.<p>We can see from this that as long as we are in this world and are therefore focused on the earthly level, we cannot be raised into wisdom itself, the way it is for angels. We can be raised only into a higher light at the boundary of angels and receive enlightenment from their light, which flows into us from within and illumines us.<p>I cannot describe this any more clearly. It is better understood through its effects; for if we have some prior knowledge about causes, their effects embody and present them in the light and thereby make them clear. </p>

<p>256. Regarded in itself, the natural degree of the human mind is continuous, but by correspondence with the two higher degrees, it appears, when elevated, as though it were distinguished into levels. Even though this can hardly be comprehended by people who do not yet possess a knowledge of degrees of height, it must nevertheless still be revealed, because it is a matter of angelic wisdom. And while the natural person cannot think of this wisdom in the same way as angels, he can still comprehend it intellectually when his intellect is elevated to the degree of light in which angels dwell. For the intellect can be elevated even to that point and be enlightened to the extent that it is elevated.<p> </p>
<p>[2] But even so, the enlightenment of the natural mind does not ascend by discrete degrees, but increases by a continuous progression. As it increases, then, the mind is accordingly enlightened from within by the light of the two higher degrees.<p>How this occurs can be comprehended from a conception of degrees of height as being one above another, with the natural or lowest degree serving as a kind of common covering enveloping the two higher degrees. As the natural degree is elevated to a higher degree, then, the higher degree accordingly acts from within upon the outer, natural degree and illumines it.<p>The illumination, indeed, comes from within from the light of the higher degrees, but the natural degree which envelops and surrounds them receives it through a continuous ascent, thus more clearly and purely in the measure of its ascent. That is to say, the natural degree is enlightened from within by the light of the higher degrees discretely, but in itself is enlightened in a continuous progression.<p> </p>
<p>[3] It is apparent from this that as long as a person lives in the world and is as a result in the natural degree, he cannot be elevated into wisdom itself such as it exists in angels, but can be elevated only into a higher light extending up to that of angels and so receive enlightenment from their light, a light which flows in from within and illumines him.<p>But this cannot be any more clearly described. It can be better comprehended from its effects; for when the causes to some extent are first known, the effects bring the causes in them to light and so illuminate them. </p>

<p>256. THE NATURAL DEGREE OF THE HUMAN MIND REGARDED IN ITSELF IS CONTINUOUS, BUT BY CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE TWO HIGHER DEGREES, WHEN IT IS ELEVATED, IT APPEARS AS IF IT WERE DISCRETE <p>Although this can scarcely be comprehended by those who have not yet a knowledge of degrees of height, it must nevertheless be revealed, because it belongs to angelic wisdom which, although it cannot be thought about by the natural man in the same way as by angels, yet can be comprehended by the understanding when this is elevated into the degree of light in which the angels are. For the understanding can be elevated thus far, and be enlightened in accordance with the elevation. The enlightenment of the natural mind, however, does not ascend through discrete degrees, but increases by a continuous degree, then as it increases, so the mind is enlightened from within by the light of the two higher degrees. How this comes about can be comprehended from a perception of degrees of height, as being one above another, and the natural degree which is the lowest, being as a kind of covering for the two higher degrees. Then as the natural degree is raised towards a degree of a higher kind, so, from within, the higher acts into the outer natural, and illuminates it. The illumination is effected, indeed, from within by the light of the higher degrees, yet that illumination is received by the natural degree which envelops and surrounds them (the higher degrees), by continuity, thus more lucidly and more purely in accordance with the ascent, that is, the natural degree is enlightened from within by the light of the higher degrees discretely, but in itself is enlightened continuously. From these facts it is clear that so long as a man lives in the world, and is thereby in the natural degree, he cannot be elevated into very wisdom such as the angels have, but only into a higher light even up to the angels, and can receive enlightenment from their light which inflows from within and illuminates. But these things cannot as yet be described more clearly. They can be better comprehended from effects, for effects present causes in themselves in light and thus illustrate them provided some previous knowledge of causes is held. </p>

256. THE NATURAL DEGREE OF THE HUMAN MIND REGARDED IN ITSELF IS CONTINUOUS, BUT BY CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE TWO HIGHER DEGREES IT APPEARS WHEN IT IS ELEVATED AS IF IT WERE DISCRETE. <p>Although this is hardly comprehensible, by those who have as yet no knowledge of degrees of height, it must nevertheless be revealed, because it is a part of angelic wisdom; and while the natural man is unable to think about this wisdom in the same way as angels do, nevertheless it can be comprehended by his understanding, when it has been raised into the degree of light in which angels are; for his understanding can be elevated even to that extent, and enlightened according to its elevation. But this enlightenment of the natural mind does not ascend by discrete degrees; but increases in a continuous degree, and as it increases, that mind is enlightened from within by the light of the two higher degrees. How this occurs can be comprehended from a perception of degrees of height, as being one above another, while the natural degree, which is the lowest, is a kind of general covering to the two higher degrees. Then, as the natural degree is raised up towards a degree of the higher kind, the higher acts from within upon the outer natural and illuminates it. This illumination is effected, indeed, from within, by the light of the higher degrees, but the natural degree which envelops and surrounds the higher receives it by continuity, thus more lucidly and purely in proportion to its ascent; that is, from within, by the light of the higher degrees, the natural degree is enlightened discretely, but in itself is enlightened continuously. From this it is evident that so long as man lives in the world, and is thereby in the natural degree, he cannot be elevated into very wisdom, such as the angels have, but only into higher light, even up to angels, and can receive enlightenment from their light that flows in from within and illuminates. But these things cannot as yet be more clearly described; they can be better comprehended from effects; for effects present causes in themselves in clear light, and thus illustrate them, when there is some previous knowledge of causes. </p>

<p>256. QUOD GRADUS NATURALIS MENTIS HUMANAE IN SE SPECTATUS SIT CONTINUUS, SED QUOD PER CORRESPONDENTIAM CUM BINIS GRADIBUS SUPERIORIBUS, DUM ELEVATUR, APPAREAT SICUT SIT DISCRETUS. Hoc tametsi aegre potest comprehendi ab illis qui nondum in scientia graduum altitudinis sunt, usque tamen revelandum est, quia Sapientiae Angelicae est, quae Sapientia quamvis ab homine naturali non potest eo modo, quo ab Angelis, cogitari, potest tamen comprehendi intellectu, dum hic usque ad gradum lucis, in qua sunt angeli, elevatur, intellectus enim potest eo usque elevari, ac secundum elevationem illustrari.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Sed illustratio Mentis naturalis non ascendit per gradus discretos, sed increscit per gradum continuum[;] tunc sicut increscit, ita ab interiori ex luce graduum binorum superiorum illustratur. Quomodo hoc fit, comprehendi potest ex perceptione graduum altitudinis, quod unus sit supra alterum, et quod gradus naturalis, qui est ultimus, sit quasi velamen commune duorum superiorum graduum[;] tunc sicut naturalis Gradus elevatur ad Gradum superiorem, <sup>1</sup>
ita superior ab interiori agit in exteriorem naturalem, ac illum illuminat: fit quidem illuminatio ab interiori ex luce graduum superiorum, at illa a gradu naturali, qui circumtegit et ambit, recipitur per continuum, ita lucidius et purius secundum ascensum; hoc est, gradus naturalis illustratur ab interiore <sup>2</sup>
ex luce graduum superiorum discrete, sed in se continue.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Ex his patet, quod homo, quamdiu in Mundo vivit, et per id in naturali gradu est, non possit elevari in ipsam sapientiam, qualis illa est apud Angelos, sed modo in lucem superiorem usque ad Angelos, ac recipere illustrationem ab illorum luce, quae ab interiori influit <sup>3</sup>
ac illuminat. Sed haec non possunt adhuc clarius describi[;] potest melius comprehendi ab effectibus, nam effectus ponunt causas, dum hae aliquantum prius sciuntur, in se in luce, et sic illustrant. <p>
