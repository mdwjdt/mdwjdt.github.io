<h4 align="center"></h4><p>379、人们都知道人和一切生物都有生命之热在里面，却不知道它的起源。每个人都是基于猜测来谈论它，因此在那些对属世事物与属灵事物的对应关系一无所知的人当中，有的将它的起源归因于太阳的热，有的归因于太阳粒子的活动，有的归因于生命本身；但他们不知道何为生命，所以就满足于纯粹的谈论。另一方面，人若知道爱及其情感与心脏及其衍生物存在一种对应关系，就会知道，生命之热的起源是爱。因为从主所在的属灵太阳发出的爱就像热，也被天使感觉为热。这属灵之热本质上是爱，通过对应流入心脏及其血液，并把热赋予它，同时使它充满活力。<br><br>人们知道，一个人会随着他的爱及其强烈程度而逐渐发热，或变得温暖，就像着了火；随着爱减弱的程度而变得无精打采和冷淡，因为他感受并看到了这热。爱可通过周身的热被感觉到，通过脸上的红晕被看到。另一方面，爱的消亡可通过身上的寒冷被感觉到，通过脸色苍白被看到。正因爱是人的生命，所以心是他生命最初和最终的容器。此外，由于爱是人的生命，灵魂通过血液来维持它在身体中的生命，所以在圣言中，血被称为灵魂(创世记9:4; 利未记17:14)。接下来将解释灵魂的各种含义。</p>

379. It is generally recognized that there is a vital warmth in humans and in all animals, but people do not know where it comes from. People discuss it on the basis of conjecture, so if they do not know anything about the way matter is responsive to spirit, they identify the warmth of the sun as its source, some focusing on the activity of particles and some on life itself. However, since these last do not know what life is, they are just substituting one word for another.<p>However, once people realize that there is a relationship of responsiveness between love and its feelings on the one hand and the heart and its derivative vessels on the other, they can know that love is the source of our vital warmth. Love radiates as warmth from the spiritual sun where the Lord is and is felt as warmth by angels. This spiritual warmth, which essentially is love, is what flows into the heart and its blood by correspondence and instills both its warmth and its life. We know that we are warmed and virtually kindled by our love, depending on its intensity, and that we become sluggish and cold as that intensity decreases. We feel and see this, feeling it in a warmth throughout our bodies and seeing it as our faces flush. In contrast, we feel its loss as a physical chill and see it as faces turn pale.<p>Since love is our life, the heart is the beginning and ending of our life; and since love is our life and the soul brings its life through the body in the blood, the blood is called the soul in the Word (see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_9_4.htm" target=_top>Genesis 9:4</a> and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_17_14.htm" target=_top>Leviticus 17:14</a>). I will be explaining later [<a href="383.htm" target=_top>383</a>] what "soul" means in its various senses. </p>

<p>379. People know that a person has in him, and every animal in it, a vital warmth, but they do not know what its origin is. Everyone speaks about it on the basis of conjecture. Consequently those who have known nothing about the correspondence of natural phenomena with spiritual ones have attributed its origin to the warmth of the sun, some to the activity of its particles, and some to life itself, though because they have not known what life is, they have simply substituted this term in speaking of it.<p>On the other hand, one who knows that there is a correspondence of love and its affections with the heart and its derivatives may also know that love is the origin of the vital warmth. For love emanates from the spiritual sun where the Lord is as warmth, and it is also felt by the angels as warmth. This spiritual warmth, which in its essence is love, is what flows by correspondence into the heart and its blood, imparting to it its warmth and at the same time animating it.<p> </p>
<p>[2] The fact that a person grows warm and, so to speak, catches fire in the measure of his love and its intensity, and that he becomes listless and cools in the measure that it wanes, is something people know, for they feel that warmth and see it. They feel it from the warmth present throughout the body, and see it from the flush of the face. And conversely, they feel its extinction from the coldness of the body, and see it from the pallor of the face.<p>Because love is a person's life, therefore the heart is the first and last vessel of that life. Moreover, because love is a person's life, and the soul maintains its life in the body by means of the blood, therefore blood in the Word is called the soul (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_9_4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_17_14.htm">Leviticus 17:14</a>).<p>What is meant by the soul in its various senses will be told in a subsequent discussion. </p>

<p>379. It is known that there is vital heat in man and in every animal; but its origin is not known. Everyone speaks of it from conjecture, consequently those who have known nothing of the correspondence of natural things with spiritual have ascribed its origin to the heat of the sun, some to activity of the parts and some to life itself; but as they did not know what life was, they simply stopped using that word. But he who knows that there is a correspondence of love and its affections with the heart and its derivations, may know that love is the origin of vital heat. For love goes forth, from the spiritual Sun where the Lord is, as heat, and moreover, is felt by the angels as heat. This spiritual heat, which in its essence is love, is what flows in by correspondence into the heart and its blood, infuses it with heat, and at the same time gives it life. That a man grows hot and, as it were, burns, according to his love and the degree of it, and becomes numb and chilled as it decreases, is known, for it is felt and seen; it is felt from the heat of the whole body, and it is seen from the flush of the face; and extinction of love, on the other hand, is felt from the coldness of the body, and seen from the pallor of the face. Because love is the life of man, the heart is the first and the last of his life. And because love is the life of man and the soul impels its life into the body through the blood, in the Word blood is called the soul (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_9_4.htm">Gen. 9:4</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_17_14.htm">Levit. 17:14</a>). The various meanings of the word "soul" will be explained in what follows. </p>

379. It is known that there is vital heat in man and in every living creature; but its origin is not known. Every one speaks of it from conjecture, consequently such as have known nothing of the correspondence of natural things with spiritual have ascribed its origin, some to the sun's heat, some to the activity of the parts, some to life itself; but as they have not known what life is, they have been content with the mere phrase. But any one who knows that there is a correspondence of love and its affections with the heart and its derivations may know that the origin of vital heat is love. For love goes forth as heat from the spiritual sun where the Lord is, and moreover is felt as heat by the angels. This spiritual heat which in its essence is love, is what inflows by correspondence into the heart and its blood, and imparts heat to it, and at the same time vivifies it. That a man grows hot, and, as it were, is fired, according to his love and the degree of it, and grows torpid and cold according to its decrease, is known, for it is felt and seen; it is felt by the heat throughout the body, and seen by the flushing of the face; and on the other hand, extinction of love is felt by coldness in the body, and is seen by paleness in the face. Because love is the life of man, the heart is the first and the last of his life; and because love is the life of man, and the soul maintains its life in the body by means of the blood, in the Word blood is called the soul (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_9_4.htm" target=_top>Gen. 9:4</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/leviticus_17_14.htm" target=_top>Levit. 17:14</a>).

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #379 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>379. Quod in homine, et in quovis animali, sit Calor vitalis, notum est, sed unde ejus origo, non notum est; quisque de eo ex conjectura loquitur, quare qui non sciverunt aliquid de Correspondentia naturalium cum spiritualibus, originem ejus adscripserunt calori solis, quidam activitati partium, quidam ipsi vitae, sed quia non sciverunt quid vita, solum in dicendo id substiterunt. Qui autem scit, quod Correspondentia sit amoris et ejus affectionum cum corde et ejus derivationibus, scire potest quod amor sit origo caloris vitalis; Amor enim procedit a Sole spirituali ubi Dominus, ut Calor, et quoque ab angelis sentitur ut Calor; hic Calor spiritualis, qui in sua essentia est amor, est qui per correspondentiam influit in Cor et ejus sanguinem, et indit ei calorem, et simul vivificat:<p> </p>
<p>[2] quod homo secundum amorem suum et ejus gradum incalescat et quasi ignescat, et quod secundum decrescentiam ejus torpescat et frigescat, notum est; nam sentitur et videtur[;] sentitur ex calore totius corporis, et videtur ex rubore faciei; ac vicissim exstinctio ejus sentitur ex frigore corporis, et videtur ex pallore faciei. Quia Amor est vita hominis, <sup>1</sup>
ideo Cor est primum et ultimum vitae ejus: et quia Amor est vita hominis, et anima vitam suam agit in corpore per sanguinem, ideo sanguis in Verbo vocatur anima, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_379/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_9_4" target=_top>Genesis 9:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_379/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_17_14" target=_top>Leviticum 17:14</a>.
