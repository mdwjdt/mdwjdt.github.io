<h4 align="center"></h4><p>427、(22)仁和信及其结合的情况，跟意愿和理解力及其结合的情况是一样的。天堂是照着两种爱来划分的，即属天之爱和属灵之爱。属天之爱是对主之爱，属灵之爱是对邻之爱。这两种爱的区别在于：属天之爱是对良善的爱，而属灵之爱是对真理的爱；因为那些处于属天之爱的人出于对良善的爱履行功用，而那些处于属灵之爱的人出于对真理的爱履行功用。属天之爱的婚姻是与智慧(的婚姻)，属灵之爱的婚姻是与聪明(的婚姻)；因为出于良善而行良善是智慧的标志，出于真理而行良善是聪明的标志。因此，属天之爱行良善，属灵之爱行真理。<br><br>这两种爱之间的区别只能以这种方式来描述：那些处于属天之爱的人拥有刻在生命上，而不是刻在记忆里的智慧，因此他们不谈论神性真理，而是实践它们。而那些处于属灵之爱的人拥有刻在记忆里的智慧，因此他们既谈论神性真理，也出于存于记忆的原则实践它们。那些处于属天之爱的人因拥有刻在生命上的智慧，故能立刻发觉他们所听到的是不是真的；当被问及它是不是真的时，他们只回答是或不是。他们就是主所说的那些人：<br><br>你们的话，是，就说是；不是，就说不是。(马太福音5:37) <br><br>此外，他们因具有这种性质，故不愿听关于信的任何事，说：“信是什么？不就是智慧吗？仁又是什么？不就是实践吗？”当被告知信就是相信不理解的东西时，他们会转身离去，说：“这家伙疯了。”<br><br>他们就是那些生活在第三层天堂的人，是最有智慧的。那些在世上通过远离地狱般的邪恶，唯独敬拜主而将所听来的神性真理直接运用于生活的人，就具有这种性质。他们因处于纯真的状态，所以在其他人看来，就像小孩子一样。由于他们从不谈论智慧之真理，言语中也没有丝毫骄傲自负的东西，所以他们看上去也很简单。然而，当听见有人说话时，他们从语气就能察觉出此人爱的全部性质，从言语察觉出他聪明的全部性质。具有这种性质的人是那些拥有来自主的爱与智慧的婚姻之人，他们与前面所提到的天国的心脏有关。</p>

<p>
427, 22. It is the same for charity and faith and their union as it is for volition and discernment and their union. There are two loves that are the grounds of a basic distinction in the heavens, namely heavenly love and spiritual love. Heavenly love is love for the Lord and spiritual love is love for our neighbor. The difference between these two loves is that heavenly love is a love for what is good, while spiritual love is a love for what is true. When we are moved by heavenly love, we do our acts of service out of love for what is good; while when we are moved by spiritual love we do them out of love for what is true. The marriage of heavenly love is with wisdom, and the marriage of spiritual love is with intelligence. Wisdom is doing what is good because it is good, and intelligence is doing what is good because it is true. This means that heavenly love acts out what is good, while spiritual love acts out what is true.<p>The only way I can describe the difference between these two loves is to say that people who are moved by heavenly love have wisdom written not on their memory but on their lives. This is because they do not talk about divine truths, they simply do them. In contrast, people who are moved by spiritual love have wisdom written on their memory, so they talk about divine truths and do them on the basis of the principles they hold in their memory.<p>Since people who are moved by heavenly love have wisdom written on their lives, whenever they hear something they know immediately whether it is true or not; and when they are asked whether something is true, they say either that it is or that it is not. They are the people referred to by the Lord's words, "Let your speech be 'Yes, yes; no, no'" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_37.htm" target=_top>Matthew 5:37</a>). Because this is their nature, they do not like it when people talk about faith. They say, "What is faith? Is it not wisdom? And what is charity? Is it not action?" If anyone says that faith is believing what we do not understand, they turn away and say, "That's crazy."<p>These are the people who live in the third heaven, and they are the wisest of all. People get that way in this world by applying whatever divine principles they hear directly to their lives with an aversion to evils as hellish and a total reverence for the Lord. Because they live in innocence, they look to others like little children; and because they never talk about truths of wisdom and there is no trace of self-importance in their conversation, they seem simple. However, when they hear others talking they can sense their whole love from their tone of voice and their whole intellect from what they are saying.<p>These are the people who are kept in the marriage of love and wisdom by the Lord. As already mentioned [<a href="381.htm" target=_top>381</a>], they also reflect the heart region of heaven. </p>

<p>427. (22) The case is the same with charity and faith and their conjunction as with the will and intellect and their conjunction. The heavens have been distinguished in accordance with two loves - celestial love and spiritual love. Celestial love is love toward the Lord, and spiritual love is love for the neighbor.<p>These loves are differentiated by the fact that celestial love is a love of good, while spiritual love is a love of truth; for people who are motivated by celestial love perform useful services from a love of good, whereas those who are motivated by spiritual love perform useful services from a love of truth. Celestial love's marriage is with wisdom, while spiritual love's marriage is with intelligence; for it is the mark of wisdom to do good in accord with good, and the mark of intelligence to do good in accord with truth. Consequently celestial love does what is good, and spiritual love does what is true.<p> </p>
<p>[2] The difference between these two loves cannot be described other than by the following observations. People who are motivated by celestial love have wisdom engraved on their life and not on their memory, and for this reason they do not talk about Divine truths but practice them. In contrast, people who are motivated by spiritual love have wisdom engraved on their memory, and consequently they talk about Divine truths and practice them in accordance with principles retained in the memory.<p>Because people who are motivated by celestial love have wisdom engraved on their life, therefore whenever they are told something, they instantly perceive whether it is true or not, and when they are asked whether it is true, they reply only either that it is or that it is not. These are the people meant by the Lord's words, "Your speech shall be 'Yes, yes,' or 'No, no' " (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>). Moreover, because they are of such a character, they do not wish to hear anything about faith, saying, "What is faith? Is it not wisdom? And what is charity? Is it not to practice?" And when they are told that faith is to believe something without understanding it, they turn away, saying, "The fellow is demented."<p> </p>
<p>[3] People of this character are those who live in the third heaven and who are the wisest of all.<p>Those became of such a character in that world who immediately applied to life the Divine verities that they heard by turning away from evils as infernal and adoring the Lord alone.<p>Because they are in a state of innocence, they appear to others like little children. And because they do not talk about truths of wisdom and have not a bit of conceit in their speech, they appear also simple. But yet when they hear someone speak, they perceive from his tone the whole nature of his love, and from his words the whole nature of his intelligence.<p>People of this character are those who possess a marriage of love and wisdom from the Lord, and who have relation to heaven's kingdom of the heart, which we discussed previously. </p>

<p>427. (xxii) It is the same with charity and faith, and their conjunction, as with will and understanding, and their conjunction. There are two loves in accordance with which the heavens are distinguished, celestial love and spiritual love. Celestial love is love to the Lord and spiritual love is love towards the neighbour. The distinction between these loves is that celestial love is the love of what is good, and spiritual love is the love of what is true; for those who live in celestial love perform uses from the love of what is good, and those who live in spiritual love from the love of what is true. The marriage of celestial love is with wisdom and the marriage of spiritual love is with intelligence; for doing what is good from good is the part of wisdom, and doing what is good from truth is the part of intelligence; wherefore celestial love does what is good, and spiritual love does what is true. The difference between these two loves can be defined only in this way, that those who live in celestial love have wisdom inscribed on their life and not on their memory, for which reason they do not talk about Divine truths, but do them; while those who live in spiritual love have wisdom inscribed on their memory, and therefore talk about Divine truths and do them from principles in the memory. Because those living in celestial love have wisdom inscribed on their life, they perceive instantly whether anything they hear is true or not; and when asked if it be true, answer only, "It is," or "It is not." These are they who are meant by the words of the Lord: <p>Let your communication be Yea, yea, Nay, nay <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_37.htm">Matt. 5:37</a>. <p>And since such is their character they are unwilling to hear anything about faith, saying, "What is faith? Is it not wisdom"? and "What is charity? Is it not doing?" and when told that faith is believing what is not understood, they turn away with the remark, "This man is out of his mind." These are they who dwell in the third heaven, and who are the wisest of all. People who applied to their life Divine truths directly they heard them, acquired such a disposition in the world by turning away from evils as infernal, and by worshipping the Lord alone. To others they appear like little children because they live in innocence, and they even seem simple because they have nothing to say about truths of wisdom, and because there is nothing of pride in their discourse. Yet all the while as they listen to anyone speaking, they perceive by the tone all things of his love, and by his speech all things of his intelligence. These are they who abide in the marriage of love and wisdom from the Lord; and who relate to the heart region of heaven, mentioned above. </p>

<p>427. XXII. Quod simile sit cum charitate et fide, et cum illarum conjunctione, ut est cum voluntate et intellectu, et cum horum conjunctione. Sunt bini amores, secundum quos Coeli distincti sunt, Amor coelestis et Amor spiritualis; Amor coelestis est amor in Dominum, et Amor spiritualis est amor erga proximum: distinguuntur hi Amores per id, quod Amor coelestis sit amor boni, ac Amor spiritualis sit amor veri; illi enim qui in Amore coelesti sunt, faciunt usus ex amore boni, et illi qui in Amore spirituali sunt, faciunt usus ex amore veri; conjugium Amoris coelestis est cum sapientia, ac conjugium Amoris spiritualis est cum intelligentia; sapientiae enim est facere bonum ex bono, ac intelligentiae est facere bonum ex vero; quare Amor coelestis facit bonum, ac Amor spiritualis facit verum.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Discrimen inter hos binos Amores non potest describi quam per haec; quod illi qui in Amore coelesti sunt, sapientiam vitae suae inscriptam habeant, et non memoriae; quae causa est, quod non de Divinis veris loquantur, sed quod faciant illa. At illi qui in amore spirituali sunt, sapientiam memoriae suae inscriptam habent, quare loquuntur de Divinis veris, ac faciunt illa ex principiis in memoria. Quia illi qui in Amore coelesti sunt, sapientiam vitae suae inscriptam habent, ideo quicquid audiunt, illico percipiunt num verum sit vel non, et cum interrogantur num verum, respondent solum vel quod sit, vel quod non sit; hi sunt qui intelliguntur per haec Domini verba, Sermo vester erit imo imo, non non, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_427/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_5_37" target=_top>Matthaeum 5:37</a>: et quia tales sunt, non volunt aliquid audire de fide; dicentes quid fides, estne sapientia, et quid charitas, estne facere; et quum illis dicitur quod fides sit credere, quod non intelligitur, avertunt se, dicentes, hic delirat.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Hi sunt qui in Tertio Coelo sunt, et qui omnium sapientissimi sunt. Tales facti sunt in Mundo illi, qui Divina quae audiverunt, statim applicuerunt vitae, aversando mala sicut infernalia, et adorando solum Dominum. Hi quia in Innocentia sunt, apparent aliis sicut infantes; et quia nihil de veris sapientiae loquuntur, et nihil ex fastu inest sermoni illorum, apparent etiam simplices; sed usque dum audiunt aliquem loquentem, ex sono <sup>1</sup>
percipiunt omnia amoris ejus, et ex loquela omnia intelligentiae ejus. Hi sunt qui in Conjugio amoris et sapientiae sunt a Domino; et qui [ad] Cardiacum Coeli referunt, de quo prius. <p>
