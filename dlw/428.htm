<h4 align="center"></h4><p>428、然而，那些处于属灵之爱，也就是对邻之爱的人，没有刻在生命上的智慧，而是有聪明；因为出于对良善的情感而行良善是智慧的标志，出于对真理的情感而行良善是聪明的标志，如前所述。这些人也不知道什么是信。当提及信时，他们理解为真理；当提及仁时，他们理解为实践真理。此外，当被告知必须相信真理时，他们称之为空谈，并说：“谁不相信真理？”他们这样说，是因为他们在自己的天堂之光中看见真理。因此，他们将相信他们所没有看到的东西要么视为头脑简单，要么视为愚蠢。具有这种性质的人是那些构成前面所提到的天国的肺脏之人。</p>

<p>
428. In contrast, people who are moved by spiritual love, by love for their neighbor, do not have wisdom written on their lives. They do have intelligence, since as already noted [<a href="427.htm" target=_top>427</a>] it is characteristic of wisdom to do what is good because we are moved by what is good and characteristic of intelligence to do what is good because we are moved by what is true. People like this do not know what faith is either. If someone mentions faith, they hear "truth," and if someone mentions charity, they hear "doing the truth." If someone says something should be believed, they call it nonsense and say, "Who doesn't believe what is true?" They say this because they are seeing what is true in the light of their heaven. So in their eyes, it is either simplemindedness or folly to believe what we do not see.<p>These are the people who make up the lung region of heaven, as also noted earlier [<a href="381.htm" target=_top>381</a>]. </p>

<p>
428. In contrast, people who are motivated by spiritual love, which is love for the neighbor, do not have wisdom engraved on their life, but intelligence, for it is the mark of wisdom to do good from an affection for good, but the mark of intelligence to do good from an affection for truth, as we said above.<p>People of this character do not know what faith is, either. If faith is mentioned, they understand it to mean truth, and when charity is mentioned, they understand it to mean practicing the truth.<p>Moreover, when they are told that truth must be believed, they call it an empty expression and say, "Who does not believe the truth?" They say this because they see truth in the light of their heaven. Consequently to believe what they do not see they call either simpleminded or foolish.<p>People of this character are those who constitute heaven's kingdom of the lungs, which we also discussed above. </p>

428. On the other hand those who live in spiritual love, which is love towards the neighbour, do not have wisdom inscribed on their life, but intelligence; for the part of wisdom is to do good from affection for what is good, and the part of intelligence is to do good from affection for what is true, as was said above. Neither do these know what faith is. When faith is mentioned they understand truth, and when charity is mentioned they understand putting into practice; and when told that they must believe, reply that this is idle talk, and ask, "Who does not believe what is true?" This they say because they see truth in the light of their own heaven; on which account, to believe what they do not see, they call either simplicity or foolishness. These constitute the lung region of heaven, also mentioned above. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #428 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
428. Those, however, who are in spiritual love, which is love towards the neighbor, do not have wisdom inscribed on their life, but intelligence; for it is of wisdom to do good from affection for good, while it is of intelligence to do good from affection for truth (as has been said above). Neither do these know what faith is. When faith is mentioned they understand truth, and when charity is mentioned they understand doing the truth; and when told that they must believe, they call it empty talk, and ask, Who does not believe what is true? This they say because they see truth in the light of their own heaven; therefore, to believe what they do not see they call either simplicity or foolishness. These are they who constitute the lung region of heaven, also mentioned above. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #428 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
428. Illi autem qui in Amore spirituali sunt, qui est amor erga proximum, non habent sapientiam vitae suae inscriptam, sed habent intelligentiam, nam sapientiae est facere bonum ex affectione boni, at intelligentiae est facere bonum <sup>1</sup>
ex affectione veri, ut supra dictum est: hi nec sciunt quid fides[;] si nominatur fides[,] intelligunt veritatem, et cum nominatur charitas[,] intelligunt facere veritatem: et cum dicitur quod [verum] credendum sit, dicunt hoc vanam loquutionem esse, et ajunt[,] quis non credit verum; hoc dicunt quia vident verum in luce sui Coeli; quare credere quod non vident, vocant vel simplicitatem vel fatuitatem. Hi sunt qui faciunt Pulmonicum Coeli, de quo etiam supra. <p>
