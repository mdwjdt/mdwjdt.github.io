<h4 align="center"></h4><p>231、人里面也有这三个层级，这一点从人心智的提升可以看出来，人类心智甚至能被提升至第二和第三层天堂的天使所拥有的爱和智慧的层级。因为所有天使生而为人；并且就属其心智的内层而言，一个人就是一个最小形式的天堂。因此，通过创造，人里面有和天堂一样多的高度层级。此外，人是神的形像和样式；所以这三个层级被刻在人身上，因为他们在神-人里面，也就是说，在主里面。主里面的这些层级是无限和非受造的，而人里面的这些层级是有限和受造的，这一点可从第一部分的说明看出来，如以下内容：主本身就是爱和智慧；人是来自主的爱与智慧的接受者；以及除了无限之物外，没有什么东西能表明主；除了有限之物外，没有什么东西能表明人。</p>

231. We can tell that there are these three levels in us from the way human minds are raised all the way into those levels of love and wisdom that angels of the second and third heaven enjoy. All those angels were born human; and in regard to the inner reaches of our minds, each of us is a miniature form of heaven. Count the number of heavens and you have the number of vertical levels within each of us, from our creation. Each of us is an image and likeness of God; so these three levels are written into us because they are in the Divine-Human One--that is, in the Lord.<p>We can tell that these levels in the Lord are infinite and uncreated while ours are finite and created on the basis of what I presented in part 1, for example from the principle that the Lord is intrinsic love and wisdom, that we are recipients of love and wisdom from the Lord, that only what is infinite can be attributed to the Lord, and that only what is finite can be attributed to us. </p>

231. The existence of these three degrees in people can be seen from the elevation of a person's mind even to the degrees of love and wisdom possessed by angels of the second and third heavens. For all angels were born people, and a person is, in respect to the interior elements which are those of his mind, a heaven in miniature form. Consequently there are from creation as many degrees of height in a person as there are heavens. The human being is furthermore an image and likeness of God, and these three degrees are therefore engraved on a person because they exist in the human God, which is to say, in the Lord.<p>As for these degrees being in the Lord infinite and uncreated and in people finite and created, this can be seen from points we demonstrated in Part One, as from the following, that the Lord is love and wisdom in Himself, whereas people are recipients of love and wisdom from the Lord; and that nothing can be predicated of the Lord except what is infinite, and nothing of people except what is finite. </p>

231. That there are these three degrees in man can be established from the elevation of his mind even to the degrees of love and wisdom in which are the angels of the second and third heaven. For all angels were born men, and man as to the interior things belonging to his mind, is a heaven in least form. Therefore, there are with man from creation as many degrees of height as there are heavens. Man is also an image and likeness of God. Consequently these three degrees have been inscribed on man because they are in God-Man, that is, the Lord. That in the Lord these degrees are infinite and uncreate, while in man they are finite and created can be established from those things which were shown in Part I, namely from this, that the Lord is Love and Wisdom in Himself, that man is a recipient of love and wisdom from the Lord, also that concerning the Lord nothing except what is Infinite can be predicated, and concerning man nothing except what is finite. </p>

<p>
231. That in man there are these three degrees can be seen from the elevation of his mind even to the degrees of love and wisdom in which angels of the second and third heavens are; for all angels were born men; and man, as regards the interiors pertaining to his mind, is a heaven in least form; therefore there are in man, by creation, as many degrees of height as there are heavens. Moreover, man is an image and likeness of God; consequently these three degrees have been inscribed on man, because they are in God-Man, that is, in the Lord. That in the Lord these degrees are infinite and uncreate, and in man finite and created, can be seen from what was shown in Part First; namely, from this, that the Lord is Love and Wisdom in Himself; and that man is a recipient of love and wisdom from the Lord; also, that of the Lord nothing but what is infinite can be predicated, and of man nothing but what is finite. </p>

<p>
231. Quod tres illi gradus in homine sint, constare potest ex elevatione mentis ejus usque ad gradus amoris et sapientiae, in quibus sunt Angeli secundi et tertii coeli, omnes enim Angeli fuerunt nati homines, et homo quoad interiora quae mentis ejus sunt, est Coelum in minima forma; quot itaque Coeli sunt, tot gradus altitudinis sunt apud hominem a creatione; homo etiam est imago et similitudo Dei, quare illi tres gradus inscripti sunt homini, quia in Deo Homine, hoc est, in Domino sunt. Quod illi Gradus in Domino infiniti et increati sint, et quod illi in homine finiti <sup>1</sup>
et creati sint, constare potest ex illis, quae <sup>2</sup>
in Parte Prima demonstrata sunt, ut ex his, quod Dominus sit Amor et Sapientia in Se; et quod homo sit recipiens Amoris et Sapientiae a Domino; tum quod de Domino nihil nisi quam Infinitum dici queat, et quod de homine nihil nisi quam finitum. <p>
