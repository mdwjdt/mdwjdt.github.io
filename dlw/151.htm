<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">2.14 主通过作为神性之爱与神性智慧的最先发出的太阳创造宇宙及其万物</h4><p>151、我们所说的“主”是指来自永恒的神，也就是耶和华，祂被称为父和造物主，因为主与父为一，如《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》所示。故在下文再次论述创造的地方，我们采用“主”这个称谓。</p>

<p>
151. The Lord created the universe and everything in it by means of that sun that is the first emanation of divine love and wisdom. "The Lord" means God from eternity or Jehovah, who is called the Father and the Creator, because as explained in Teachings for the New Jerusalem on the Lord, the Lord and the Father are one. When I return to the topic of creation below [<a href="282.htm" target=_top>282-357</a>], therefore, I will refer to "the Lord." </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #151 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
151. The Lord created the universe and everything in it by means of the sun which is the first emanation of His Divine love and wisdom. By the Lord we mean God from eternity or Jehovah, who is called the Father and the Creator, because the Lord is identical with Him, as we showed in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord. Consequently in subsequent discussions where we again consider creation, we use the term Lord. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #151 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
151. THE LORD CREATED THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING THEREIN BY MEANS OF THE SUN WHICH IS THE FIRST PROCEEDING OF THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM <p>By the Lord is understood God from eternity, or Jehovah, Who is called Father and Creator, because He is one with Him, as has been shown in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD. Consequently, in the following sections where also creation is treated of, He is called the Lord. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #151 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
151. THE LORD CREATED THE UNIVERSE AND ALL THINGS OF IT BY MEANS OF THE SUN WHICH IS THE FIRST PROCEEDING OF DIVINE LOVE AND DIVINE WISDOM. <p>By "the Lord" is meant God from eternity, that is, Jehovah: who is called Father and Creator, because He is one with Him, as has been shown in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord; consequently in the following pages, where also creation is treated of, He is called the Lord </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #151 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
151. QUOD DOMINUS UNIVERSUM ET OMNIA EJUS MEDIO SOLE, QUI EST PRIMUM PROCEDENS DIVINI AMORIS ET DIVINAE SAPIENTIAE, CREAVERIT. Per Dominum intelligitur Deus ab aeterno seu Jehovah, qui Pater et Creator vocatur, quia unus est cum Illo, ut in DOCTRINA NOVAE HIEROSOLYMAE DE DOMINO ostensum est: quare in sequentibus, ubi etiam de Creatione agitur, Dominus nominatur. </p>
