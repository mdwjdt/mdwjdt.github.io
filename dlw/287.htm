<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第287节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>287、爱和智慧就是人，这一点也可从以下事实看出来：天堂天使是人，他们从主那里获得的爱和智慧越多，他们就越是美丽的人。这一点从圣言中论及亚当的话可以看出来，即：他是照着神的形像和样式造的(创世记1:26)，因为他被造为爱和智慧的形式。就肉体而言，世上的每个人都生为人的形式，因为他的灵，也就是我们所说的灵魂，是一个人；这灵或灵魂就是人，因为它能从主那里接受爱和智慧。此外，人的灵或灵魂接受的爱和智慧越多，包裹他的肉体死后，他就越成为一个人；反之，它越不接受它们，他就越成为一个怪物，尽管这怪物从他接受它们的能力中获得某种人类品质。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #287 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
287. We can also tell that love and wisdom are human by looking at heaven's angels, who are people in full beauty to the extent that they are caught up in love, and therefore in wisdom, from the Lord. The same conclusion follows from what it says in the Word about Adam's being created in the image and likeness of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_1_26.htm" target=_top>Genesis 1:26</a>), because he was created in the form of love and wisdom.<p>All earthly individuals are born in the human form as to their physical bodies. This is because our spirit, which is also called our soul, is a person; and it is a person because it is receptive of love and wisdom from the Lord. To the extent that our spirit or soul actually accepts love and wisdom, we become human after the death of these material bodies that we are carrying around. To the extent that we do not accept love and wisdom we become grotesque creatures, retaining some trace of humanity because of our ability to accept them. </p>

<p>
287. That love and wisdom are human can also be seen from the appearance of angels in heaven, who are the more beautifully human the more love and wisdom they possess from the Lord.<p>The same can be seen from what we are told in the Word about Adam, that he was created into the likeness and image of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_1_26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>), because he was created into the form of love and wisdom.<p>Every person on earth is born into the human form anatomically. That is because his spirit - which we also call the soul - is human; and it is human because it is capable of receiving love and wisdom from the Lord. Furthermore, the more a person's spirit or soul does receive these, the more human he becomes after the death of the material body with which he was clothed; and the more it does not receive them, the more of a monster he becomes, though retaining some human quality from his capability of receiving them. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #287 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
287. That love and wisdom are man can also be evidenced from the fact that the angels of heaven are men and are beautiful to the extent in which they are in love and its wisdom from the Lord. The same can be established from what is said in the Word concerning Adam, that he was created into the likeness and into the image of God (Gen. I, 26), because into the form of love and wisdom. Every man on earth is born into the human form as regards his body, for the reason that his spirit, which is also called his soul, is a man. And this is a man because it is receptive of love and wisdom from the Lord. And to the extent that the spirit or soul of a man receives these, so far he becomes a man after the death of the material body which enveloped him. But so far as he does not receive them, to that extent he becomes a monster which derives something of man from the ability to receive. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #287 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
287. That love and wisdom are man is further evident from the fact that the angels of heaven are men in beauty in the measure in which they are in love and its wisdom from the Lord. The same is evident from what is said of Adam in the Word, that he was created into the likeness and into the image of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_1_26.htm" target=_top>Gen. 1:26</a>), because into the form of love and wisdom. Every man on earth is born into the human form as regards his body, for the reason that his spirit, which is also called his soul, is a man; and this is a man because it is receptive of love and wisdom from the Lord; and so far as these are received by the spirit or soul of man, so far it becomes a man after the death of the material body which it had drawn about it; and so far as these are not received it becomes a monster, which derives something of manhood from the ability to receive. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #287 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
287. Quod amor et sapientia sint homo, etiam constare potest ex Angelis Coeli, qui quantum in amore et inde sapientia a Domino sunt, tantum in pulchritudine homines sunt. <sup>1</sup>
Idem constare potest ex eo, quod in Verbo dicitur de Adamo, quod in similitudinem et in imaginem Dei creatus sit, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_287/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_1_26" target=_top>Genesis 1:26</a>, quia in formam amoris et sapientiae. Omnis homo telluris in humanam formam quoad corpus nascitur; causa est, quia spiritus ejus, qui etiam vocatur anima, est homo; et hic est homo, quia est receptibilis amoris et sapientiae a Domino, et quantum spiritus seu anima hominis recipit, tantum ille fit homo post mortem corporis materialis, quod circumduxit, <sup>2</sup>
et quantum non recipit, tantum fit monstrum, quod aliquid hominis ex facultate recipiendi trahit. <p>
