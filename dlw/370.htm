370. We do need to note that while the essential forms of the members, organs, and viscera of the body are basically woven from fibers that begin from primary origins in our brains, still they are stabilized by the kinds of material substance that we find on earth, and from solid substances in the air and the ether. This happens by means of the blood. So if all the parts of the body are to maintain their proper form and hold up in their proper functions, we need to be nourished by material food and constantly reassembled. </p>

370. It should be noted that the forms themselves of a person's members, organs and viscera are, as to their essential structure, the product of fibers arising from their first elements in the brain, but that they are given fixity by such substances and materials as exist in the earth and from the earth in the air and ether, which is effectuated by means of the blood. Consequently, for all the constituents of the body to remain in their formation and so continue in their functions, a person must be sustained with material food and be continually renewed. </p>

<p>
370. It is to be noted that the very forms of a man's members, organs and viscera in respect of their actual structure, are from fibres that arise out of their beginnings in the brains, but that they are fixed by means of such substances and matters as are in the earths, and from the earths in the air and ether, and that this is effected by means of the blood. Therefore, in order that all things of the body may continue to exist in their formation, and thus be permanent in their functions, man must be nourished by material food, and be continually renewed. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #370 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
370. It is to be observed that the very forms of man's members, organs, and viscera, as regards the structure itself, are from fibers that arise out of their first principles in the brains; but these become fixed by means of such substances and matters as are in earths, and from earths in air and in ether. This is effected by means of the blood. Consequently, in order that all parts of the body may be maintained in their formation and rendered permanent in their functions, man requires to be nourished by material food, and to be continually renewed. </p>

370. Observandum <sup>1</sup>
est, quod ipsae formae membrorum, organorum et viscerum hominis quoad ipsam contexturam sint ex fibris oriundis ex principiis suis in Cerebris, sed quod fixentur per substantias et materias quales sunt in terris, et ex terris in aere et aethere, quod fit medio sanguine; quare ut omnia corporis in sua formatione subsistant, et sic in functionibus suis permaneant, homo nutriendus est cibo materiali, et jugiter redintegrandus. <p>
