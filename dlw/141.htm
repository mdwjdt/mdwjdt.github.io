<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第141节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>141、由于现在讨论的是天使和灵人如何照自己的爱而转向自己的爱，所以有必要说一说爱。整个天堂照着爱的所有不同种类而被划分为各个社群，地狱和灵人界同样如此。但天堂照着天堂之爱的不同种类而被划分为各个社群；地狱则照着地狱之爱的不同种类而被划分为各个社群；灵人界照着天堂之爱和地狱之爱的不同种类而被划分为各个社群。有两种爱是其它所有爱的首领，也就是说，其它所有爱都与这两种爱有关。一切天堂之爱的首领，或与它们相关的那爱是对主之爱；一切地狱之爱的首领，或与它们相关的那爱是源于自我之爱的统治之爱。这两种爱彼此截然对立。</p>

141. Something also needs to be said about loves, since we are talking about how angels and spirits turn toward their loves because of their loves.<p>Heaven as a whole is laid out in communities depending on all the differences in loves. So is hell, and so is the world of spirits. Heaven, though, is laid out in communities according to differences in heavenly loves, while hell is laid out in communities according to differences in hellish loves, and the world of spirits is laid out in communities according to differences in both heavenly and hellish loves.<p>There are two loves that are at the head of all the rest, and two loves that lie behind all the rest. The head of all heavenly loves, the love basic to them all, is love for the Lord. The head of all hellish loves, or the love that underlies them all, is a love of controlling prompted by self-love. These two loves are absolute opposites. </p>

141. We must also say something about loves, because we are discussing the turning of angels and spirits toward their loves in accordance with their loves.<p>The whole of heaven is distinguished into societies in accordance with all the different kinds of loves existing there. So, too, hell. And so also the world of spirits. Heaven, however, is distinguished into societies in accordance with different kinds of heavenly loves; hell into societies in accordance with different kinds of hellish loves; and the world of spirits into societies in accordance with different kinds of both heavenly and hellish loves.<p>There are two loves which head all the rest, or to which all other loves are related. The love which is at the head of all heavenly loves or to which all other heavenly loves are related is love toward the Lord. And the love which is at the head of all hellish loves or to which all other hellish loves are related is a love of ruling stemming from a love of self. These two loves are diametrically opposed to each other. </p>

141. Something will also be stated concerning loves, because the turning of angels and spirits by reason of their loves, to their loves is being treated of. The whole heaven is distinguished into societies according to all the differences of loves, similarly, hell, and in like manner, the world of spirits. But heaven is distinguished into societies according to the differences of heavenly loves, whereas hell is distinguished into societies according to the differences of hellish loves, and the world of spirits according to the differences of loves both heavenly and hellish. There are two loves which are the heads of all the others, or to which all other loves are related. The love which is the head, or to which all heavenly loves are related, is love to the Lord; and the love which is the head of all hellish loves and to which they relate, is the love of domineering from the love of self. Those two loves are diametrically opposed to each other. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #141 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
141. Since the subject now under consideration is the turning of angels and spirits to their own loves by reason of these loves, something shall be said also about loves. The whole heaven is divided into societies according to all the differences of loves; in like manner hell, and in like manner the world of spirits. But heaven is divided into societies according to the differences of heavenly loves; hell into societies according to the differences of infernal loves; and the world of spirits, according to the differences of loves both heavenly and infernal. There are two loves which are the heads of all the rest, that is, to which all other loves are referable; the love which is the head of all heavenly loves, or to which they all relate, is love to the Lord; and the love which is the head of all infernal loves, or to which they all relate, is the love of rule springing from the love of self. These two loves are diametrically opposed to each other. </p>

<p>
141. Dicetur etiam aliquid de Amoribus, quia agitur de conversione angelorum et spirituum ex suis amoribus ad suos amores. Universum Coelum in Societates distinctum est secundum omnes differentias amorum; similiter Infernum; et similiter Mundus spirituum: sed Coelum est distinctum in Societates secundum differentias amorum coelestium; Infernum autem in Societates secundum differentias amorum infernalium; Mundus vero spirituum secundum differentias amorum tam coelestium quam infernalium. Sunt duo Amores, qui sunt Capita omnium reliquorum, seu ad quos se omnes reliqui Amores referunt: Amor qui caput, seu ad quem omnes amores coelestes se referunt, est Amor in Dominum; et Amor qui caput, seu ad quem se referunt omnes amores infernales, est Amor dominandi ex amore sui: illi bini Amores sunt e diametro sibi oppositi. </p>
