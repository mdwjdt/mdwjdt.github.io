<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第144节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>144、由于源于自我之爱的统治之爱与对主之爱完全对立，所以凡陷入这种统治之爱的灵人都将脸转离主，因而眼望灵界的西方；他们在身体上处于反方向，所以其背后是东方，右边是北方，左边是南方。他们之所以背对东方，是因为他们憎恨主；北方在右，是因为他们喜欢谬误和由此产生的虚假；南方在左，是因为他们鄙视智慧之光。他们也能自由转动，然而周围所看到的一切都与他们的爱相似。这类灵人都是感官-属世的；有的具有这样的性质，他们以为唯独自己活着，把其他人看作幽灵。他们觉得自己比谁都有智慧，尽管事实上他们都是疯子。</p>

<p>
144. Since a love of controlling prompted by self-love is the absolute opposite of love for the Lord, spirits caught up in this love of controlling turn away from the Lord. So their eyes are looking toward that world's west; and since their bodies are turned around, the east is behind them, the north is on their right, and the south is on their left. The east is behind them because they harbor a hatred of the Lord; the north is on their right because they love illusions and the consequent distortions; and the south is on their left because they have no use for the light of wisdom. They can turn this way and that, but still everything they see around themselves looks like their love.<p>They all are oriented toward outward nature and their senses. They are the kind of people who think they are the only ones who are really alive and who see others as unreal. They think they themselves are wiser than anyone else, even though they are insane. </p>

144. Since a love of ruling stemming from a love of self is altogether opposed to love toward the Lord, therefore spirits who are prompted by that love of ruling turn their face in the opposite direction from the Lord, and so look with their eyes to the west in their world. Moreover, because they are in body turned around in a contrary direction, to their rear is the east, to their right the north, and to their left the south.<p>They have the east to their rear because they hate the Lord. They have the north to their right because they love fallacious ideas and consequent falsities. And they have the south to their left because they disdain the light of wisdom.<p>They can turn around and around, but all the sights that they see surrounding them appear to their love the same.<p>These spirits are all sensually natural, and some are of such a character as to believe that they alone are alive, regarding others as phantoms. They believe they are wiser than all others, even though they are insane. </p>

144. Since the love of domineering is from self-love it is absolutely opposed to love to the Lord. Therefore, the spirits who are in that love of domineering turn the face backward from the Lord, and thus with their eyes look towards the west of the spiritual world. And because they are thus as to the body in an opposite turning, the east is behind them, the north on their right and the south on their left. The east is behind them because they hold the Lord in hatred; the north is on their right because they love fallacies and the consequent falsities; and the south is on their left because they scorn the light of wisdom. They are able to turn round and round but all the things which they see about them appear similar to their love. All these are sensual-natural, and some are of such a nature as to have the opinion that they alone live, and they regard others as phantoms. They believe themselves to be wise above all others, although they are insane. </p>

<p>
144. Since the love of rule springing from love of self is wholly opposed to love to the Lord, the spirits who are in that love of rule turn the face backwards from the Lord, and therefore look with their eyes to the western quarters of the spiritual world; and being thus bodily in a reversed position, they have the east behind them, the north at their right, and the south at their left. They have the east behind them because they hate the Lord; they have the north at their right, because they love fallacies and falsities therefrom; and they have the south at their left, because they despise the light of wisdom. They may turn themselves round and round, and yet all things which they see about them appear similar to their love. All such are sensual-natural; and some are of such a nature as to imagine that they alone live, looking upon others as images. They believe themselves to be wise above all others, though in truth they are insane. </p>

<p>
144. Quoniam amor dominandi ex amore sui est prorsus oppositus amori in Dominum, ideo spiritus, qui in amore illo dominandi sunt, faciem retro vertunt a Domino, et inde oculis spectant ad occidentem istius Mundi; et quia sic in contrario versu quoad corpus sunt, a tergo illis est Oriens, ad dextrum illis est septentrio, et ad sinistrum illis est meridies: a tergo illis est Oriens, quia odio habent Dominum, ad dextrum illis est septentrio, quia fallacias et inde falsitates amant, et ad sinistrum illis est meridies, quia lucem sapientiae spernunt. Possunt se circum et circum vertere, sed omnia quae circum se vident, apparent amori suo similia. Sunt omnes illi naturales sensuales, et quidam tales ut opinentur se solos vivere, et spectent alios tanquam imagines: credunt se sapere super omnes, tametsi insaniunt. </p>
