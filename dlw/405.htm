<h4 align="center"></h4><p>405、来自属意愿的爱的这三者在理解力中依次相随，这一点的确能被理性人理解，却无法被清楚看见，从而无法被证明，以至于被相信。但由于通过对应，属于意愿的爱与心行如一体，属于理解力的智慧与肺行如一体，如前所示，所以我们刚才(404节)关于对真理的情感和对真理的感知，以及思维的说明，再没有比在肺及其结构中看得更清楚、证明得更充分的了。因此，必须简要描述这些情况。<br><br>出生后，心脏将血液从右心室输送到肺部，在经过肺部之后，又将它(从左心房)排入左心室，从而打开肺部。心脏通过肺动脉和肺静脉完成这一过程。肺部有支气管，支气管分叉，最后终止于肺泡；肺允许空气进入肺泡，从而进行呼吸。支气管及其分支周围还有被称为支气管动脉和支气管静脉的动脉和静脉，它们是由奇静脉或腔静脉和主动脉产生的。这些动脉和静脉与肺动脉和肺静脉是分开的。由此明显可知，血液通过两条路线流入肺部，并通过两条路线从肺部流出。这就是为何肺部呼吸的节奏与心脏的不同。众所周知，心脏的交替运动和肺部的交替运动并不一致。<br><br>由于心和肺与意愿和理解力存在一种对应关系，如前所示，还由于因着这种对应关系，它们的结合具有这样的性质：这一个怎样起作用，那一个就怎样起作用，所以从血液由心脏流入肺部可以看出意愿如何流入理解力，并产生刚才(404节)关于对真理的情感和感知，以及思维所说的那些结果。它们的对应关系向我揭示了这一切，以及许多与这个主题有关，但无法用三言两语解释清楚的其它事。<br><br>既然爱或意愿对应于心，智慧或理解力对应于肺，那么可推知，肺里面的心血管对应于对真理的情感，肺支气管的分支对应于源于这些情感的感知和思维。凡从其起源探究肺部的所有组织，并与意愿的爱和理解力的智慧进行类比的人，都能在一种形像中看见前面(404节)所提到的事物，从而对它们深信不疑。然而，由于只有少数人熟悉心肺的解剖学细节，还由于通过不熟悉的东西来证实一件事会造成模糊，所以我省略了进一步的类比论证。</p>

405. Granted, rational people can understand that these three follow sequentially in our discernment from the love that belongs to our volition, but they still cannot see it clearly enough to believe it with confidence. However, since by virtue of correspondence the love proper to volition acts in concert with the heart and the wisdom proper to discernment acts in concert with the lungs, as already explained, there is no better way to see and show what I have just said about the desire for what is true, the grasp of what is true, and thinking (see <a href="404.htm" target=_top>404</a> above) than by looking at the lungs and their construction; so I need to describe this briefly.<p>After birth, the heart sends blood into the lungs from its right ventricle, and once it has passed through, it sends it into its left ventricle. This is what opens the lungs. The heart does this by means of the pulmonary arteries and veins. The lungs have bronchia that branch off and ultimately turn into the little sacs where the lungs admit air and thereby breathe. There are also arteries and veins (called "bronchial") around the bronchia and their branches. They start from the azyga or vena cava and the aorta, and they are distinct from the pulmonary arteries and veins. This enables us to see that the blood flows into the lungs by two routes and flows out of them by two routes. This is why the lungs can breathe in a different rhythm from the heart. It is widely recognized that the rhythms of the heart and the rhythms of the lungs are not the same.<p>Now, since the correspondence of the heart and lungs is with our volition and discernment, as already explained [<a href="371.htm" target=_top>371-393</a>], and since union by correspondence means that the one behaves in the same way as the other, we can see from the blood flow from the heart into the lungs how volition flows into discernment and causes the things mentioned in <a href="404.htm" target=_top>404</a> about our desire for what is true, about our grasp of what is true, and about thought. Correspondence has shown me this and even more on this topic, which I cannot describe briefly.<p>Since love or volition answers to the heart and wisdom or discernment answers to the lungs, it follows that the blood vessels from the heart to the lungs answer to desires for what is true and that the branches of the lungs' bronchia answer to perceptions and thoughts generated by those desires. If you were to look into the way the lungs are woven from these origins and draw the parallel with the love of our volition and the wisdom of our discernment, you could see a kind of image of what I have said in <a href="404.htm" target=_top>404</a> and come to believe it with confidence.<p>However, since not many people are familiar with the anatomical data about the heart and the lungs, and since supporting a proposition with unfamiliar material yields confusion, I forbear presenting any further instances of the parallelism. </p>

<p>405. The observation that these three elements follow in succession in the intellect from love residing in the will is one that a rational person can indeed comprehend, but still not one that can be clearly seen and thus so confirmed as to be believed.<p>Now because love residing in the will operates by correspondence in union with the heart, and wisdom residing in the intellect in union with the lungs, as we have shown above, therefore what we have just said in no. <a href="404.htm">404</a> above regarding an affection for truth, a perception of truth, and thought, can nowhere be more clearly seen and confirmed than in the lungs and their design. Consequently these must be briefly described.<p> </p>
<p>[2] The heart after birth transmits blood from its right ventricle into the lungs, and following its passage through them, discharges it [from the left atrium] into its left ventricle, thus opening the lungs. <sup>1</sup>
The heart accomplishes this through the pulmonary arteries and veins.<p>The lungs have bronchial tubes which branch out and finally end in tiny sacs, into which the lungs admit air and so breathe.<p>Surrounding the bronchial tubes and their ramifications are also arteries and veins called the bronchial arteries and veins, arising from the azygos vein or the vena cava and from the aorta.<p>These arteries and veins are separate from the pulmonary arteries and veins.<p>It is apparent from this that blood flows into the lungs by two routes, and flows from them by two routes. That is why the lungs can breathe in a rhythm different from that of the heart. The fact that the alternate motions of the heart and the alternate motions of the lungs do not coincide is something people know.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Now because there is a correspondence of the heart and lungs with the will and intellect, as we have shown, and their conjunction by correspondence is such that one functions as the other, it can be seen from the flow of blood from the heart into the lungs how the will flows into the intellect and accomplishes what we have just stated in no. <a href="404.htm">404</a> above regarding an affection for and perception of truth, and thought. Their correspondence has disclosed this to me, and many other things as well which cannot be briefly described.<p> </p>
<p>[4] Since love or the will corresponds to the heart, and wisdom or the intellect to the lungs, it follows that the heart's blood vessels in the lungs correspond to affections for truth, and that the ramifications of the lungs' bronchial tubes correspond to perceptions and thoughts springing from those affections.<p>Anyone who explores all the tissues of the lungs from their origins and draws a parallel with love in the will and wisdom in the intellect can see, as though in a kind of reflected image, the things described in no. <a href="404.htm">404</a> above and be so convinced as to believe them.<p>However, because the particulars belonging to the science of anatomy regarding the heart and lungs are known to few, and to confirm something by means of things unknown induces unintelligibility, therefore I forgo demonstrating the parallelism further.<p>

1.&nbsp;In the mature heart, blood from the veins enters from the right atrium into the right ventricle, is pumped to the lungs, and returning from there to the left atrium, enters the left ventricle and is pumped through the aorta into the body. In the fetal heart, the venous blood passes from the right atrium through an opening called the foramen ovale into the left atrium and so into the left ventricle, bypassing the right ventricle. </p>

<p>405. That these three things from the love which belongs to the will follow in sequence in the understanding can indeed be comprehended by a rational man, but not yet seen clearly, and so cannot be confirmed to the extent of faith. Now since love which belongs to the will acts as one with the heart by correspondence, and wisdom which belongs to the understanding acts as one with the lungs, as shown above, what has just been said (<a href="404.htm">404</a>) concerning affection for truth, perception of truth, and thought, can nowhere be more clearly seen and confirmed than in the lungs and the structure thereof. These, therefore, must be briefly described. After birth, the heart discharges the blood from its right ventricle into the lungs; and, after passing through these, empties it into its left ventricle; and so opens the lungs. This it does through the pulmonary arteries and veins. The lungs have bronchial tubes which branch out, and finally terminate in air-cells, into which the lungs admit air and so breathe. Around the bronchial tubes and their branches there are arteries and veins, called bronchia, rising from the vena azygos or vena cava and from the aorta. These arteries and veins are distinct from the pulmonary arteries and veins. These facts make it plain that the blood flows into the lungs by two ways and flows out of them by two ways. This enables the lungs to breathe at a different rate from the heart's beat. It is well known that the alternate motions of the heart and of the lungs respectively do not act as one. Now since there is a correspondence of the heart and lungs with the will and understanding, as was shown above, and since conjunction by correspondence is such that as one acts, so the other acts, it can be seen, by the influx of blood from the heart into the lungs, how the will flows into the understanding, and affects the things mentioned just above, concerning affection for and perception of truth, and concerning thought (<a href="404.htm">404</a>). Correspondence has revealed to me this and many other things concerning them, which cannot be described in a few words. Since love or the will corresponds to the heart, and wisdom or the understanding corresponds to the lungs, it follows that the blood vessels of the heart in the lungs correspond to affections for truth, and the branches of the bronchia of the lungs to perceptions and thoughts from those affections. Anyone who explores all the tissues of the lungs from these beginnings and makes the analogy with the love of the will and with the wisdom of the understanding, will be able to see as in a certain image the things mentioned above (<a href="404.htm">404</a>), and so be confirmed in faith. But since the facts of anatomical knowledge concerning the heart and lungs are known to a few, and confirming anything by the unknown leads to obscurity, I refrain from further demonstration of the analogy. </p>

405. That these three from the will's love follow in order in the understanding can, indeed, be comprehended by the rational man but yet cannot be clearly seen and thus so proved as to command belief. But as love that is of the will acts as one with the heart by correspondence, and wisdom that is of the understanding acts as one with the lungs (as has been sh <a href="404.htm" target=_top>(Divine Love and Wisdom 404)</a> own above) therefore what has been said (in n. 404) about affection for truth, perception of truth, and thought, can nowhere be more clearly seen and proved than in the lungs and the mechanism thereof. These, therefore, shall be briefly described. After birth, the heart discharges the blood from its right ventricle into the lungs; and after passing through these it is emptied into the left ventricle: thus the heart opens the lungs. This it does through the pulmonary arteries and veins. The lungs have bronchial tubes which ramify, and at length end in air-cells, into which the lungs admit the air, and thus respire. Around the bronchial tubes and their ramifications there are also arteries and veins called the bronchial, arising from the vena azygos or vena cava, and from the aorta. These arteries and veins are distinct from the pulmonary arteries and veins. From this it is evident that the blood flows into the lungs by two ways, and flows out from them by two ways. This enables the lungs to respire non-synchronously with the heart. That the alternate movements of the heart and the alternate movements of the lungs do not act as one is well known. Now, inasmuch as there is a correspondence of the heart and lungs with the will and understanding (as shown above), and inasmuch as conjunction by correspondence is of such a nature that as one acts so does the other, it can be seen by the flow of the blood out of the heart into the lungs how the will flows into the understanding, and produces the results mentioned just above (n. <a href="404.htm" target=_top>404</a>) respecting affection for and perception of truth, and respecting thought. By correspondence this and many other things relating to the subject, which cannot be explained in a few words, have been disclosed to me. Whereas love or the will corresponds to the heart, and wisdom or the understanding to the lungs, it follows that the blood vessels of the heart in the lungs correspond to affections for truth, and the ramifications of the bronchia of the lungs to perceptions and thoughts from those affections. Whoever will trace out all the tissues of the lungs from these origins, and disclose the analogy with the love of the will and the wisdom of the understanding, will be able to see in a kind of image the things mentioned above (n. <a href="404.htm" target=_top>404</a>), and thereby attain to a confirmed belief. But since a few only are familiar with the anatomical details respecting the heart and lungs, and since confirming a thing by what is unfamiliar induces obscurity, I omit further demonstration of the analogy. </p>

<p>405. Quod haec tria ex amore qui est voluntatis, in Intellectu ordine sequantur, ex rationali homine quidem comprehendi potest, sed tamen non clare videri, et sic usque ad fidem confirmari: nunc quia amor qui est voluntatis per correspondentiam unum agit cum corde, ac sapientia quae est intellectus unum agit cum pulmone, ut supra ostensum est, ideo non alibi clarius videri et confirmari possunt illa quae de affectione veri, perceptione veri, et cogitatione, mox supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_405/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_404" target=_top>404</a> dicta sunt, quam in Pulmone et ejus fabrica, quare haec paucis describenda est.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Cor post partum a dextro suo ventriculo immittit sanguinem in Pulmonem; et post transitum emittit illum in sinistrum suum ventriculum[;] sic <sup>1</sup>
aperit pulmonem; hoc facit cor per arterias et venas pulmonares: sunt Pulmoni bronchia, quae ramificantur, et tandem abeunt in vesiculas, in quas Pulmo admittit aerem et sic respirat: circum bronchia et illorum <sup>2</sup>
ramificationes etiam sunt arteriae et venae, quae bronchiales vocantur, oriundae ex azyga seu vena cava et aorta: hae arteriae et venae ab arteriis et venis pulmonaribus distinctae sunt: ex his patet, quod sanguis per binas vias influat in pulmonem, et per binas vias effluat ex illo; inde est quod Pulmo possit respirare non synchrone cum corde; quod alternae vices cordis <sup>3</sup>
et alternae vices pulmonis non unum agant, notum est.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Nunc quia correspondentia cordis et pulmonis est cum voluntate et intellectu, ut ostensum est, et conjunctio per correspondentiam est talis, ut sicut unum agit, ita alterum, videri potest ex influxu sanguinis e corde in pulmonem, quomodo voluntas influit in intellectum, et facit illa, quae mox supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_405/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_404" target=_top>404</a> de affectione et perceptione veri, et de cogitatione, dicta sunt; correspondentia hoc mihi detexit, et plura adhuc de illis, quae non paucis describi possunt.<p> </p>
<p>[4] Quoniam amor seu voluntas correspondet cordi, ac sapientia seu intellectus correspondet pulmoni, sequitur quod vasa sanguinea cordis in Pulmone correspondeant affectionibus veri, et quod ramificationes bronchiorum pulmonis correspondeant perceptionibus et cogitationibus ex illis affectionibus: qui indagat omnes texturas pulmonis ex illis originibus, et facit paralelismum cum amore voluntatis et cum sapientia intellectus, ille potest sicut in quadam imagine videre illa quae supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_405/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_404" target=_top>404</a> dicta sunt, et sic ad fidem confirmari. Sed quia illa quae scientiae anatomicae sunt de Corde et Pulmone, paucis nota sunt, et confirmare aliquid per ignota inducit obscuritatem, ideo supersedeo paralelismum pluribus demonstrare. <p>
