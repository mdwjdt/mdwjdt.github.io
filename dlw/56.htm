<h4 align="center"></h4><p>56、每一个受造物都凭这种起源而具有这样的性质：它通过与神的非连续性联系(译注：参看下文离散层级)，而非通过连续性联系(译注：参看下文连续层级)成为神的接受者。其结合的能力来自非连续性联系，而非来自连续性联系。事实上，它已在神里面从神被造，故适合结合；它因已如此被造，故是一种类似物，并通过这种结合而好似神在镜中的形像。</p>

<p>
56. Everything created from this source is in its own nature suited to be receptive of God not by continuity but by contact. Union comes through contact, not through continuity. What is created is suitable for this contact because it has been created by God in God. Because it has been created in this way, it is an analog; and because of the union, it is like an image of God in a mirror. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #56 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
56. Everything created is from its origin of such a nature as to be a recipient of God, not by a continuous connection with Him but by a discontinuous one. The second and not the first is the way through which it is capable of conjunction; for everything created is an accordant form, having been created in God from God; and because it has been so created, it is an analogue, and by that conjunction it is as though the image of God in a mirror. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #56 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
56. Every created thing, by virtue of its origin, is such in its nature that it may be a recipient of God, not by continuity, but by contiguity. By the latter and not by the former there is conjunctivity. For it is in accord, because it has been created in God by God. And having been created thus, it is an analogue, and by this conjunction is like an image of God in a mirror. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #56 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
56. Every created thing, by virtue of this origin, is such in its nature as to be a recipient of God, not by continuity, but by contiguity. By the latter and not the former comes its capacity for conjunction. For having been created in God from God, it is adapted to conjunction; and because it has been so created, it is an analogue, and through such conjunction it is like an image of God in a mirror. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #56 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
56. Omne Creatum ex ea origine est tale in sua natura, ut sit recipiens Dei, non per continuum sed per contiguum; per hoc et non per illud est conjunctivum, est enim conveniens quia in Deo a Deo creatum est, et quia ita creatum est, est analogon, et per conjunctionem illam est sicut imago Dei in speculo. </p>
