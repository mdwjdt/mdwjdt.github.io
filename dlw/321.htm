<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第321节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>321、要知道，表面上看，灵界和自然界一模一样。在那里和在自然界一样能看到陆地、山脉、丘陵、山谷、平原、田野、湖泊、河流、泉水，因而看见属于矿物界的一切事物；还能看到公园、花园、果园、森林，以及其中结果实和种子的各样树木和灌木；也能看到植物、花卉、草本、青草，因而看到属于植物界的一切事物；又能看到各种走兽、飞鸟和鱼，因而看到属于动物界的一切事物。在那里的一个人就是一位天使或一个灵人。预先提及这一切，是为了叫人们知道，灵界的宇宙和自然界的宇宙完全一样，区别仅在于：灵界的事物不像自然界的那样固定不变，因为灵界没有一物是属世的，一切都是属灵的。</p>

321. We need to realize that to all outward appearances, the spiritual world is just like the physical world. You can see lands there, mountains, hills, valleys, plains, fields, lakes, rivers, and springs like the ones in our earthly world; everything, then, that belongs to the mineral kingdom. You can see parks as well, gardens, groves, and woods, with all kinds of trees and shrubs with their fruits and seeds, smaller plants, flowers, herbs, and grasses; everything, then, that belongs to the plant kingdom. You can see all kinds of animals, birds, and fish--everything that belongs to the animal kingdom. The people there are angels and spirits.<p>This is prefaced to let it be known that the whole spiritual world is just like the whole physical world, the sole difference being that things there are not static and stable the way they are in a physical world because there is nothing of nature there. Everything is spiritual. </p>

321. It should be known that in outward appearance the spiritual world is just like the natural world. One sees there lands, mountains, hills, valleys, plains, fields, lakes, rivers, and springs, just as in the natural world, thus all the phenomena belonging to the mineral kingdom. One sees also parks, gardens, groves, and forests, in which are found trees and bushes of every kind, with fruits and seeds, and plants, flowers, herbs, and grasses, thus all the phenomena belonging to the plant kingdom. One sees animals, birds, and fish of every kind, thus all the phenomena belonging to the animal kingdom. A person there is an angel or spirit.<p>This much is premised in order to make it known that the universe of the spiritual world is just like the universe of the natural world, the only difference being that the phenomena which exist there are not fixed and set like phenomena in the natural world, because nothing there is natural, but everything spiritual. </p>

321. It should be known that the spiritual world is, in external appearance, wholly like the natural world. Lands, mountains, hills, valleys, plains, fields, lakes, rivers, fountains are to be seen there just as in the natural world, thus all things belonging to the mineral kingdom. There are also to be seen paradises, gardens, groves, woods, and in them trees and shrubs of all kinds along with fruits and seeds. There are also plants, flowers, herbs and grasses, thus all things belonging to the vegetable kingdom. Beasts, birds and fishes of all kinds are to be seen, thus all things belonging to the animal kingdom. Man there is an angel or spirit. This is premised that it may be known that the universe of the spiritual world is wholly like that of the natural world with this difference only that the things in the spiritual world are not fixed and static like those in the natural world, because there nothing is natural but everything is spiritual. </p>

321. It should be known that the spiritual world is in external appearance, wholly like the natural world. Lands, mountains, hills, valleys, plains, fields, lakes, rivers, springs of water are to be seen there, as in the natural world; thus all things belonging to the mineral kingdom. Paradises, gardens, groves, woods, and in them trees and shrubs of all kinds bearing fruit and seeds; also plants, flowers, herbs, and grasses are to be seen there; thus all things pertaining to the vegetable kingdom. There are also to be seen there, beasts, birds, and fishes of every kind; thus all things pertaining to the animal kingdom. Man there is an angel or spirit. This is premised that it may be known that the universe of the spiritual world is wholly like the universe of the natural world, with this difference only, that things in the spiritual world are not fixed and settled like those in the natural world, because in the spiritual world nothing is natural but every thing is spiritual. </p>

321. Sciendum est, quod Mundus spiritualis in externa apparentia sit prorsus similis Mundo naturali[;] apparent ibi terrae, montes, colles, valles, planities, campi, lacus, fluvii, fontes, sicut in Mundo naturali, ita omnia quae Regni mineralis sunt: apparent etiam paradisi, horti, luci, sylvae, in quibus arbores et virgulta omnis generis cum fructibus et seminibus, tum plantae, flores, herbae et gramina, ita omnia quae sunt Regni vegetabilis: apparent animalia, volatilia, ac pisces omnis generis, ita omnia quae sunt Regni animalis: homo ibi est Angelus et Spiritus. Hoc praemissum est, ut sciatur, quod universum Mundi spiritualis sit prorsus simile universo Mundi naturalis, cum sola differentia, quod illa, quae ibi sunt, non sint fixa et stata sicut quae in Mundo naturali, quia ibi non est aliquid naturale, sed omne spirituale. </p>
