<h4 align="center"></h4><p>383、由于理解力对应于肺，由此而来的思维对应于肺的呼吸，所以在圣言中，“灵魂”和“灵”表示理解力。如：<br><br>你要用全部的心、全部的灵魂爱主你的神。(马太福音22:37) <br><br>神将赐一个新心和一个新灵。(以西结书36:26; 诗篇51:10) <br><br>前面已说明，“心”表示意愿的爱(378节)；因此，“灵魂”和“灵”表示理解力的智慧。<br><br>神的灵，也被称为圣灵，表示神性智慧，因而表示神性真理，就是世人的光，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》一书(50,51节)；因此，主向祂的门徒吹气，并说：“你们受圣灵”(约翰福音20:22)。这就是为何经上还说：<br><br>耶和华神将生命的气息吹在亚当的鼻孔里，他就成了一个活的灵魂。(创世记2:7) <br><br>这也是为何祂对先知说：<br><br>向灵发预言，对风说，灵啊，要从四风而来，吹在这些被杀的人身上，使他们活了。(以西结书37:9) <br><br>其它地方也有类似经文。因此，主被称为“鼻中的气息”和“生命的气息”。由于呼吸要通过鼻子，所以鼻子表示感知；人们会说一个聪明人有敏锐的鼻子，一个不聪明的人没有一个敏锐的鼻子。也正是由于这个原因，在希伯来语和其它语种中，“灵”和“风”是同一个词。因为“灵”这个词源自一个表示“呼吸”的词。因此，当一个人死亡时，人们就会说他咽下最后一口气，交出了灵。也正因如此，人们以为灵是一阵风，或某种空气，就像肺里呼出的一股呼气，灵魂具有同样的性质。<br><br>由此可见，“用全部的心和全部的灵魂爱神”表示用全部的爱和全部的理解力来爱祂，“赐新心和新灵”表示赐一个新意愿和一个新理解力。由于“灵”表示理解力，故经上论到比撒列说：<br><br>他充满智慧，聪明，知识的灵。(出埃及记31:3)<br><br>论到约书亚说：<br><br>他被智慧的灵充满。(申命记34:9)<br><br>尼布甲尼撒论到但以理说：<br><br>他里头有美好的灵，有知识、聪明和智慧。(但以理书5:11,12)<br><br>以赛亚书上说：<br><br>灵里犯错的必得明白。(以赛亚书29:24)<br><br>在其它许多地方也是如此。</p>

383. Since our discernment corresponds to our lungs, and our thinking therefore to their breathing, "soul" and "spirit" in the Word mean discernment, as in "you shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart and your whole soul" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_35.htm" target=_top>Matthew 22:35</a> [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_37.htm" target=_top>22:37</a>]), or "God will give a new heart and a new spirit" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_36_26.htm" target=_top>Ezekiel 36:26</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_51_12.htm" target=_top>Psalms 51:12-13</a> [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_51_10.htm" target=_top>51:10</a>]). I have already explained [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_22.htm" target=_top>John 20:22</a>). This is also why it says, "Jehovah God breathed the breath of life into Adam's nostrils, and he became a living soul" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_2_7.htm" target=_top>Genesis 2:7</a>), and why God said to the prophet, "Prophesy over the spirit and say to the wind, 'Come, spirit, from the four winds and breathe upon these who have been slain, so that they may live'" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_9.htm" target=_top>Ezekiel 37:9</a>). There are similar statements elsewhere as well. It is why the Lord is called the spirit of the nostrils and also the breath of life.<p>Since our breathing comes through our nostrils, they are used to mean perception. An intelligent person is referred to as "keen-scented," and a dense person as "dull-scented." This is also why in Hebrew and in some other languages, "spirit" and "wind" are expressed by the same word. In fact, the word "spirit" is derived from [a root that means] breathing; so when people die we speak of their "breathing their last." This is also why people believe that a spirit is a wind or something airy, like the breath that issues from our lungs, and believe the same of the soul as well.<p>We can tell from this that "loving God with the whole heart and with the whole soul" means with all our love and all our discernment, and that "giving a new heart and a new spirit" means a new volition and a new discernment.<p>It is because the spirit means discernment that it says of Bezaleel that "he was filled with the spirit of wisdom, intelligence, and knowledge" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_31_3.htm" target=_top>Exodus 31:3</a>) and of Joshua that "he was filled with the spirit of wisdom" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_34_9.htm" target=_top>Deuteronomy 34:9</a>), and that Nebuchadnezzar said of Daniel that "a superlative spirit, one of knowledge and intelligence and wisdom was in him" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_6_5.htm" target=_top>Daniel 6:5</a> [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_11.htm" target=_top>5:11-12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_14.htm" target=_top>14</a>]), and why it says in Isaiah that "those who are wandering in spirit will know intelligence" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_29_24.htm" target=_top>Isaiah 29:24</a>). Similar statements may be found in many other places. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #383 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>383. Since the intellect corresponds to the lungs, and consequently thought to the respiration of the lungs, therefore soul and spirit in the Word symbolically mean the intellect, as in the statements, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>), and that God will give a new heart and a new spirit (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_36_26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_51_10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>). <sup>1</sup>
We have already shown above that "heart" is used symbolically to mean the love of the will. <sup>2</sup>
Therefore by soul and spirit are symbolically meant the wisdom of the intellect.<p> </p>
<p>[2] In <a href="../lord/50.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord 50-51</a>, it may be seen that by the spirit of God, called also the Holy Spirit, is meant Divine wisdom, and so Divine truth, through which a person has enlightenment. That is why the Lord breathed on His disciples and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_22.htm">John 20:22</a>). That is why it is also said that Jehovah God breathed into Adam's nostrils the breath of life, and he became a living soul (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_2_7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). That, too, is why He said to the prophet,<p>Prophesy upon the spirit?, and say to the wind?: 'Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.' (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_9.htm">Ezekiel 37:9</a>)<p>So similarly elsewhere. So it is that the Lord is called the breath of the nostrils <sup>3</sup>
and also the breath of life.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Because breath passes through the nostrils, therefore the nose symbolizes perception; and an intelligent person is said to have a keen nose, and an unintelligent one not a keen nose.<p>It is owing to this, too, that the word for spirit and wind in Hebrew and in some other languages is the same. For the word "spirit" is derived from a word meaning "to breathe." Consequently when a person dies he is also said to breathe his last and yield up the spirit.<p>It is owing to this as well that people believe the spirit to be a gust of wind or some airy entity, like a puff of breath exhaled from the lungs, and the soul likewise.<p> </p>
<p>[4] It can be seen from this that to love God with all one's heart and all one's soul means to do so with all one's love and all one's intellect, and that giving a new heart and a new spirit means giving a new will and a new intellect.<p>Because the word "spirit" symbolically means the intellect, therefore it is said of Bezalel that he was filled with the spirit of wisdom, understanding, and knowledge (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_31_3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>); of Joshua that he was full of the spirit of wisdom (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_34_9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>); by Nebuchadnezzar of Daniel that he had an excellent spirit in him, of knowledge, understanding, and wisdom (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_11.htm">Daniel 5:11-12</a>); and in Isaiah, "Those who err in spirit will know understanding" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_29_24.htm">Isaiah 29:24</a>). So likewise in many other places.<p>

<p>383. Since the understanding corresponds to the lungs, and thought therefrom to the respiration of the lungs, therefore in the Word, "soul" and "spirit" signify the understanding: as where it is said: <p>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul Matt. dd. 37 <p>God will give a new heart and a new spirit <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_36_26.htm">Ezek. 36:26</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_51_10.htm">Ps. 51:10</a> <p>That "heart" signifies the love of the will was shown above; therefore "soul" and "spirit" signify the wisdom of the understanding. That by the spirit of God, also called the Holy Spirit, is signified Divine Wisdom, and therefore Divine Truth, by which men are enlightened, may be seen in the DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD (<a href="../ss/50.htm">50-51</a>). <p>Hence it is that: <p>The Lord breathed on His disciples, and said, Receive ye the Holy Spirit. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_22.htm">John 20:22</a> <p>For the same reason it is said that: <p>Jehovah God breathed into the nostrils of Adam the breath of lives, and he was made a living soul. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_2_7.htm">Gen. 2:7</a> <p>Also He said to the prophet, <p>Prophesy upon the breath, and say unto the wind, Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_9.htm">Ezek. 37:9</a> <p>Likewise in other places; therefore the Lord is called "The breath of the nostrils," and "the breathing place [spiraculum] of life." Because respiration passes through the nostrils, they signify perception; and an intelligent man is said to be keen-scented, and an unintelligent man to be dull-scented. For the same reason, spirit, and wind in the Hebrew and in some other languages are the same word; for the word spirit is derived from a word that means breathing; and therefore, when a man dies, he is said "to give up the ghost" (anima). It is from this also that men believe the spirit to be wind, or an airy something like breath from the lungs, and the soul to be of similar nature. From these things it can be established that to "love God with all the heart and all the soul" means to love Him with all the love and with all the understanding, and to "give a new heart and a new spirit" means to give a new will and a new understanding. Because "spirit" means understanding, it is said of Bezaleel: <p>That he was filled with the spirit of wisdom, of intelligence and of knowledge <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_21_3.htm">Exod. 21:3</a> <p>And of Joshua: <p>That he was filled with the spirit of wisdom <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_34_9.htm">Deut. 34:9</a> <p>And Nebuchadnezzar says of Daniel: <p>That an excellent spirit of knowledge, of intelligence, and of wisdom, was in him <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_11.htm">Dan. 5:11-12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_14.htm">14</a> <p>And it is said in Isaiah: <p>They that err in spirit shall acquire intelligence <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_29_24.htm">Isa. 29:24</a> <p>Likewise in many other places. </p>

383. Since the understanding corresponds to the lungs and thought therefrom to the respiration of the lungs, in the Word, "soul" and "spirit" signify the understanding; for example: <p>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul (Matt. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_37.htm" target=_top>22:37</a>). <p>God will give a new heart and a new spirit (Ezek. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_36_26.htm" target=_top>36:26</a>; Psalm <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_51_10.htm" target=_top>51:10</a>). <p>That "heart" signifies the love of the will was shown above; therefore "soul" and "spirit" signify the wisdom of the understanding. That the spirit of God, also called the Holy Spirit, means Divine Wisdom, and therefore Divine Truth which is the light of men, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. <a href="../lord/50.htm" target=_top>50, 51</a>), therefore, <p>The Lord breathed on His disciples, and said, Receive ye the Holy Spirit John <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_22.htm" target=_top>20:22</a>); <p>for the same reason it is said that: <p>Jehovah God breathed into the nostrils of Adam the breath of lives, and he was made into a living soul (Gen. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_2_7.htm" target=_top>2:7</a>); <p>also He said to the prophet: <p>Prophesy upon the breath, and say unto the wind, Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live (Ezek. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_9.htm" target=_top>37:9</a>); <p>likewise in other places; therefore the Lord is called "the breath of the nostrils," and "the breath of life." Because respiration passes through the nostrils, perception is signified by them; and an intelligent man is said to be keen-scented, and an unintelligent man to be dull-scented. For the same reason, spirit and wind in the Hebrew, and in some other languages, are the same word; for the word spirit is derived from a word that means breathing; and therefore when a man dies he is said to give up the ghost [anima]. It is for the same reason that men believe the spirit to be wind, or an airy something like breath breathed out from the lungs, and the soul to be of like nature. From all this it can be seen that to "love God with all the heart and all the soul" means to love Him with all the love and with all the understanding, and to "give a new heart and a new spirit" means to give a new will and a new understanding. Because "spirit" signifies understanding, it is said of Bezaleel: <p>That he was filled with the spirit of wisdom, of intelligence, and of knowledge (Exod. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/exodus_31_3.htm" target=_top>31:3</a>); <p>and of Joshua: <p>That he was filled with the spirit of wisdom (Deut. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/deuteronomy_34_9.htm" target=_top>34:9</a>); <p>and Nebuchadnezzar says of Daniel: <p>That an excellent spirit of knowledge, of intelligence, and of wisdom, was in him (Dan. 5: <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_11.htm" target=_top>11, 12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_5_14.htm" target=_top>14</a>); <p>and it is said in Isaiah: <p>They that err in spirit shall learn intelligence (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_29_24.htm" target=_top>29:24</a>); <p>likewise in many other places. </p>

<p>383.

Inde est, quod Dominus spiraverit in discipulos, et dixerit[,] accipe Spiritum Sanctum, Joh. . Inde etiam dicitur, quod Jehovah Deus inspiraverit in nares Adami animam vitarum, et factus est in animam viventem, Gen. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_383/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_2_7" target=_top>Psalm 2:7</a>: et quod dixerit Prophetae[,] "Propheta super spiritu, et dic ad ventum, a quatuor <sup>4</sup>
