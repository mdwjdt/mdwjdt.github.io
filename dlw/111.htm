<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第111节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>111、事实的确如此，这一点几乎无法以属世观念来理解，因为属世观念含有空间概念在里面；但能以天使所拥有的那种属灵观念来理解，因为属灵观念不含空间概念在里面。然而，即便以属世观念，也大可理解：爱与智慧，或作为神性之爱与神性智慧的主，绝无可能穿越空间，而是照各人对祂的接受而与各人同在。主与所有人同在，主自己在马太福音(28:20)中教导了这一点，还说祂与那些爱祂的人同住(约翰福音14:23)。</p>

111. It is almost impossible to grasp this in any earthly image, since that would involve space. It can be grasped in a spiritual image, though, since there is no space involved. That is the kind of image angels have.<p>This much can be grasped in an earthly image, though--love and wisdom, or in other words the Lord who is divine love and wisdom, cannot move through space but is with every one of us depending on our acceptance. The Lord teaches in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_20.htm" target=_top>Matthew 28:20</a> that he is with everyone; and in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_21.htm" target=_top>John 14:21</a> [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm" target=_top>23</a>] he says that he makes his home with those who love him. </p>

111. The reality of this can hardly be comprehended if a natural idea is formed of it, because it has in it a notion of space; but it can be comprehended if a spiritual idea is formed, because this does not have in it a notion of space. That is the idea angels have of it.<p>Still, even if a natural idea is formed, this much can be comprehended, that love and wisdom, or in other words, the Lord, who is Divine love and wisdom, cannot possibly travel through intervals of space, but that He is present in everyone in accordance with the person's reception of Him.<p>That the Lord is present in all people, He Himself teaches in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>, <sup>1</sup>
and that He makes His abode in those who love Him, in John 14bb23. <sup>2</sup>

111. That such is the case can scarcely be comprehended by a natural idea because in that there is [the thought of] space. But it can be comprehended by a spiritual idea because in that there is no [thought of] space. It is this idea that the angels have. But it can be comprehended even by a natural idea that love and wisdom, or what is the same, that the Lord Who is Divine Love and Divine Wisdom cannot advance through spaces, but is with everyone according to reception. That the Lord is present with all, He Himself teaches in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>, and that He makes His abode with those who love Him, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm">John 14:23</a>. </p>

111. That this is so can hardly be comprehended by a natural idea, because in such there is space, but by a spiritual idea, such as angels have, it can be comprehended, because in such there is no space. Yet even by a natural idea this much can be comprehended, that love and wisdom (or what is the same, the Lord, who is Divine Love and Divine Wisdom) cannot advance through spaces, but is present with each one according to reception. That the Lord is present with all, He teaches in Matthew (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_20.htm" target=_top>28:20</a>), and that He makes His abode with those who love Him, in John (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_23.htm" target=_top>14:23</a>). </p>

111. Quod ita sit, aegre potest comprehendi idea naturali, quia in illa est spatium, sed potest comprehendi idea spirituali, quia in ea non est spatium; in hac idea sunt Angeli. Hoc usque comprehendi idea naturali potest, quod Amor et Sapientia, seu quod idem, quod Dominus qui est Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia, non possit progredi per spatia, sed quod sit apud unumquemvis secundum receptionem. Quod Dominus sit praesens apud omnes, docet Ipse apud Matthaeum Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_111/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_28_20" target=_top>Matthaeum 28:20</a>: et quod mansionem faciat apud illos qui amant Ipsum, Joh. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_111/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_14_23" target=_top>Matthaeum 14:23</a>. <sup>1</sup>
