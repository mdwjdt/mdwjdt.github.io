<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">2.2 热与光从神性之爱与神性智慧所产生的太阳发出</h4><p>89、天使和灵人所居的灵界与世人所居的自然界一样，也有热和光在里面。而且，热同样被感受为热，光也被视为光。但灵界的热与光完全不同于自然界的热与光，可以说毫无共同之处。它们彼此的区别犹如活物与死物的区别。灵界的热本身是活的；光也是活的；而自然界的热本身是死的，光也是死的。因为灵界的热与光从纯然为爱的太阳发出，而自然界的热与光从纯然为火的太阳发出；爱是活的，神性之爱是生命本身；而火是死的，自然界太阳的火是死亡本身。它之所以被称为死亡，是因为它没有一丝生命在里面。</p>

89. Warmth and light emanates from the sun that arises from divine love and wisdom. In the spiritual world where angels and spirits live, there is just as much warmth and light as there is in the physical world where we live. The warmth feels just like warmth and the light looks just like light, as well. Still, the warmth and light of the spiritual world and the warmth and light of the physical world are so different that they have nothing in common, as I have already mentioned [<a href="83.htm" target=_top>83</a>]. They are as different as life and death. The warmth of the spiritual world is essentially alive, and so is the light; while the warmth of the physical world is essentially dead, and so is the light. The warmth and the light of the spiritual world come from a sun that is nothing but love, while the warmth and light of the physical world come from a sun that is nothing but fire. Love is alive, and divine love is life itself. Fire is dead, and solar fire is death itself. We may call it that because it has absolutely no life in it. </p>

89. From the sun arising from Divine love and wisdom emanate heat and light. The spiritual world where angels and spirits dwell has in it heat and light just like the natural world where people dwell. Moreover the heat is also felt as heat and the light seen as light in a similar way. But still heat and light in the spiritual world and heat and light in the natural world differ so much that, as said above, they have nothing in common. They differ from each other as something animate and something inanimate. Heat in the spiritual world is, in itself, animate, and so, too, light, whereas heat in the natural world is, in itself, inanimate, and so, too, light. For heat and light in the spiritual world emanate from a sun which is pure love, while heat and light in the natural world emanate from a sun which is nothing but fire; and love is animate, and Divine love is life itself, while fire is inanimate, and solar fire is lifelessness itself. We can call it that because it has not the least speck of life in it. </p>

89. HEAT AND LIGHT WHICH COME FORTH FROM THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM PROCEED FROM THE SUN <p>In the spiritual world in which angels and spirits are, there are heat and light just as in the natural world in which men are. And moreover, the heat is felt as heat, and similarly light is seen as light. But yet the heat and light of the spiritual world and that of the natural world differ to such an extent that they have nothing in common, as was stated above. They differ from each other as the living and the dead. The heat of the spiritual world in itself is living and likewise the light, while the heat of the natural world in itself is dead, likewise the light. For the heat and light of the spiritual world come forth from the Sun which is pure Love, whereas the heat and light of the natural world come forth from a sun which is pure fire. Further, Love is living and Divine Love is Life Itself, and fire is dead and the fire of the sun is death itself, and so it can be called, from the reason that there is absolutely nothing of life in it. </p>

<p>
89. OUT OF THE SUN THAT TAKES FORM [existit] FROM THE DIVINE LOVE AND THE DIVINE WISDOM, HEAT AND LIGHT GO FORTH. <p>In the spiritual world where angels and spirits are there are heat and light, just as in the natural world where men are; moreover in like manner as heat, the heat is felt and the light is seen as light. Still the heat and light of the spiritual world and of the natural world are (as said above) so entirely different as to have nothing in common. They differ one from the other as what is alive differs from what is dead. The heat of the spiritual world in itself is alive; so is the light; but the heat of the natural world in itself is dead; so is its light. For the heat and light of the spiritual world go forth from a sun that is pure love, while the heat and light of the natural world go forth from a sun that is pure fire; and love is alive, and the Divine Love is Life itself; while fire is dead, and solar fire is death itself, and may be so called because it has nothing whatever of life in it. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #89 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
89. QUOD EX SOLE, QUI EX DIVINO AMORE ET DIVINA SAPIENTIA EXISTIT, PROCEDAT CALOR ET LUX. In Mundo spirituali, in quo sunt Angeli et Spiritus, sunt aeque Calor et Lux, ut in Mundo naturali, in quo sunt Homines; et quoque Calor sentitur ut calor, et Lux videtur ut lux similiter; sed usque Calor et Lux Mundi spiritualis et Mundi naturalis differunt in tantum, ut nihil commune habeant, ut supra dictum est; differunt inter se sicut vivum et mortuum; Calor Mundi spiritualis in se est vivus, pariter Lux, Calor autem Mundi naturalis in se est mortuus, pariter Lux; Calor enim et Lux Mundi spiritualis procedunt ex Sole qui est purus Amor, ac Calor et Lux Mundi naturalis procedunt ex Sole qui est purus Ignis, ac Amor est vivus, et Divinus Amor est ipsa Vita, et Ignis est mortuus, ac Solaris ignis est ipsa mors; ita vocari potest, ex causa quia prorsus nihil vitae ei inest. </p>
