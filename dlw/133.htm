<h4 align="center"></h4><p>133、由于天堂由天使组成，而天使又具有这样的性质，故可知，整个天堂转向主，主通过这种转向掌管天堂如同掌管一个人。天堂在主眼里就像一个人，这一点可见于《天堂与地狱》一书(59-87节)。这也是天堂有方位的原因。</p>

133. Now, since heaven is made up of angels, and since this is what angels are like, it follows that the whole heaven faces the Lord and that because it does, heaven is governed by the Lord as though it were a single individual--which is what heaven looks like in the Lord's sight. On heaven looking like a single individual in the Lord's sight, see <a href="../hh/59.htm" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 59-87</a> [<a href="59.htm" target=_top>59-86</a>]. This is the cause of heaven's regions as well. </p>

133. Now because heaven consists of angels, and angels are as described, it follows that the whole of heaven turns to the Lord, and that in consequence of that turning the Lord governs heaven as a single individual, which is also how heaven appears in the Lord's sight. That heaven in the Lord's sight is like a single individual may be seen in the book Heaven and Hell, nos. <a href="../hh/59.htm">59-87</a>.<p>This, too, is the reason there are zones in heaven. </p>

133. Now because heaven is made up of angels, and angels are of such a nature, it follows that the entire heaven turns itself to the Lord, and that, by that turning, heaven is ruled by the Lord as one Man, even as heaven is in the sight of the Lord. That heaven is as one man in the sight of the Lord may be seen in the work HEAVEN AND HELL (<a href="../hh/59.htm">59-87</a>). Also from this are the quarters of heaven. </p>

<p>
133. Now since heaven is made up of angels, and angels are of such a nature, it follows that all heaven turns itself to the Lord, and that, by means of this turning, heaven is ruled by the Lord as one man, as in His sight it is one man. That heaven is as one man in the sight of the Lord may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell (n. <a href="../hh/59.htm" target=_top>59-87</a>). Also from this are the quarters of heaven. </p>

133. Nunc quia Coelum est ex Angelis, et Angeli sunt tales, sequitur quod universum Coelum vertat se ad Dominum, et quod Coelum per illam conversionem regatur a Domino ut unus Homo, quemadmodum etiam Coelum in conspectu Domini est; quod Coelum in conspectu Domini sit sicut unus Homo, videatur in Opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_133/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_59" target=_top>de COELO ET INFERNO 59-87</a>: inde etiam sunt Plagae Coeli. </p>
