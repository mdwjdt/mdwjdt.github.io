<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第118节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>118、刚才所说关于天使的话，也适用于由天使组成的天堂，因为神性在最大和最小事物上是一样的(如前所示，77-82节)。关于天使和天堂所说的话，同样适用于世人和教会，因为天堂天使和教会之人通过结合行如一体。此外，就属其心智的内层而言，一个教会之人就是一位天使。不过，我们所说的教会之人指的是有教会在里面的人。</p>

118. We can say much the same about the heaven that is made up of angels as we have said about individual angels, since Divinity is the same in the largest and smallest things (see <a href="77.htm" target=_top>77-82</a> above). What we have said about angels and heaven needs to be said about us and the church as well, since angels of heaven and we of the church act in consort because of our union. Further, as to the inner reaches of our minds, we of the church are angels--but "we of the church" means people who have the church within themselves. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #118 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
118. What we have just said in regard to an angel must also be said of heaven, which consists of angels, since the Divine in the greatest and least of things is the same, as we demonstrated above in nos. <a href="77.htm">77-82</a>.<p>What we have said of an angel and heaven must likewise be said of a person and the church, for an angel of heaven and a person of the church operate in union through their conjunction. Moreover, in respect to his interior elements, which are those of his mind, a person of the church is an angel. However, by a person of the church we mean one who has the church in him. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #118 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
118. The same as has now been said about an angel must be said about heaven which consists of angels, since the Divine is the same in greatest and in least things (as was shown above<a href="77.htm">77-82</a>). The same as has been said about an angel and about heaven must be said about man and the Church. For an angel of heaven and a man of the Church act as one through conjunction. Further, a man of the Church is an angel in respect of the interiors which are of his mind. But by a man of the Church is understood a man in whom the Church is. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #118 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
118. What has just been said of an angel is likewise true of heaven, which consists of angels, since the Divine in greatest and least things is the same (as was shown above n. <a href="77.htm" target=_top>77-82</a>). What is said of an angel and of heaven is likewise true of man and the church, for the angel of heaven and the man of the church act as one through conjunction; in fact, a man of the church is an angel, in respect to the interiors which are of his mind. By a man of the church is meant a man in whom the church is. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #118 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
118. Simile quod nunc dictum est de Angelo, dicendum est de Coelo quod ex angelis consistit, quoniam Divinum in maximis et minimis est idem, ut supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_118/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_77" target=_top>77-82</a> <sup>1</sup>
demonstratum est. Simile quod dictum est de Angelo et Coelo, dicendum est de Homine et Ecclesia, nam Angelus coeli et Homo ecclesiae unum agunt per conjunctionem; et quoque homo Ecclesiae quoad interiora quae mentis ejus sunt, est angelus: sed per hominem Ecclesiae intelligitur homo in quo est Ecclesia. <p>
