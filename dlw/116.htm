<h4 align="center"></h4><p>116、现在必须解释一下，天使如何能将不是自己的东西感知并觉察为自己的，进而接受并保留下来。因为如前所述，天使之为天使不是由于他自己的任何东西，而是由于他里面来自主的那些品质。这个问题的本质是这样：每位天使都有自由和理性；他拥有这二者是为了他能从主接受爱和智慧。然而，自由和理性都不是他的，而是属于他里面的主。但由于这两种官能与他的生命紧密相联，并且联结得如此紧密，以至于可以说它们是他生命不可或缺的一部分，所以它们看上去就像属于他的能力。正是由于它们，他才能思考和意愿，还能说话和行动；他凭它们所思、所愿、所说、所行的看似出于他自己。这使得结合所必需的相互性成为可能。<br><br>然而，天使在何等程度上相信爱与智慧是他里面所固有的，因而声称拥有它们，就好像它们是他自己的，他就在何等程度上不具备天使的品质，因而没有与主的结合；因为他不在真理中；由于真理与天堂之光构成一体，不可分离，所以他无法在天堂；因为他会由此否认他的生命来自主，反以为他凭自己活着，并由此拥有神性本质。被称为天使和世人的生命就在于自由和理性这二者。<br><br>由此可见，为了与主结合，天使拥有相互的能力，但这种能力就本身而言，并不是他的，而是主的。正因如此，这种相互能力使天使将主的东西感知并觉察为自己的，但天使若将这种能力归于自己，从而滥用它，就会从天使的状态堕落。结合是相互的，主亲自教导了这一点(约翰福音14:20-24,15:4-6)；还教导，主与人并人与主的结合在主的事物里面实现，这些事物被称为祂的话(约翰福音15:7)。</p>

116. However, this calls for an explanation of how angels can feel and sense this as their own and so accept and retain it when in fact it is not theirs, given the statement that angels are not angels on their own but by virtue of what is within them from the Lord. The essence of the matter is this. There is freedom and rationality in every angel. These two qualities are there so that angels can be open to love and wisdom from the Lord. Neither of these, though--neither the freedom nor the rationality--belongs to the angels. They are in them but belong to the Lord. However, since these two elements are intimately united to angels' life, so intimately united that you could call them linked to their life, it seems as though they belong to the angels. Freedom and rationality enable them to think and intend and to speak and act; and what they think, intend, speak, and act as a result seems to be done on their own. This gives rise to the reciprocal element that is the means to union.<p>Still, the more that angels believe that love and wisdom are within them and claim them for themselves as their own, the more there is nothing angelic within them. To the same extent, then, there is no union with the Lord for them. They are outside the truth; and since truth is identical with heaven's light, they are correspondingly unable to be in heaven. This leads to a denial that they live from the Lord and a belief that they live on their own and therefore that they possess some divine essence. The life called angelic and human consists of these two elements--freedom and rationality.<p>This leads to the conclusion that angels have a reciprocal ability for the sake of their union with the Lord, but that the reciprocal element, seen as an ability, is the Lord's and not theirs. As a result, angels fall from angelhood if they abuse this reciprocal element that enables them to feel and sense what is the Lord's as their own by actually claiming it for themselves. The Lord himself teaches us in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm" target=_top>John 14:20-24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm" target=_top>15:4-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_6.htm" target=_top>6</a> that union is reciprocal, and in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_7.htm" target=_top>John 15:7</a> that the Lord's union with us and ours with him occurs in things that belong to him, things called "his words." </p>

<p>116. However, we must now say how it is possible for an angel to perceive and feel something as his own, and so receive and retain it, when in fact it is not his. For we said above that an angel is not an angel because of anything his own, but because of those qualities which are in him from the Lord.<p>The fact of the matter is essentially this. Every angel possesses in him freedom and rationality. He has these two faculties in him in order that he may be capable of receiving love and wisdom from the Lord. Still, neither faculty, freedom or rationality, is his, but both are the Lord's in him. Yet because these two faculties are intimately bound up with his life, so intimately that they may be called integral to his life, therefore they appear as powers belonging to him. Because of them he can think and will, and speak and act, and what he thinks, wills, speaks and does by virtue of them appears as something emanating from him. This makes possible the reciprocity necessary for conjunction.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Even so, however, to the extent an angel believes that love and wisdom are inherent in him and so claims them as his own, to the same extent he lacks in him the angelic quality and thus conjunction with the Lord. For he has not arrived at the truth; and because truth is inseparable from the light of heaven, to that extent he cannot be in heaven. Indeed, because of his belief he denies that his life is from the Lord, believing that he lives of himself and consequently that he possesses the Divine essence.<p>In these two faculties, freedom and rationality, consists the life which we call angelic and human.<p> </p>
<p>[3] From this it can be seen that an angel possesses the ability to reciprocate for the sake of conjunction with the Lord, but that regarded in itself, the ability to do so is not the angel's but the Lord's. So it is that if this ability to reciprocate, which causes the angel to perceive and feel as his what is the Lord's, is abused by him, which he does by making it his, he falls from the angelic state.<p>That conjunction is reciprocal, the Lord Himself teaches in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-24</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">15:4-6</a>; <sup>1</sup>
and that a conjunction of the Lord with a person and of a person with the Lord is achieved in things that are the Lord's, which are called His words, in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_7.htm">John 15:7</a>. <sup>2</sup>

1.&nbsp;"At that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you. He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him." Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, "Lord, how is it that You will manifest Yourself to us, and not to the world?" Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father's who sent Me." (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-24</a>)<p>"Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned."

<p>116. It will now be explained how it comes about that an angel perceives and feels as his own, and thus receives and retains that which yet is not his (for, as was said above, an angel is not an angel from what is his own, but from those things which are with him from the Lord). The essence of the matter is thus. Every angel has liberty and rationality. He has these two so that he may be capable of receiving love and wisdom from the Lord. Yet each of these, liberty as much as rationality, is the Lord's with him, and not his. But because these two are intimately conjoined to his life, so intimately that they may be said to be joined into his life, therefore they appear as if they were his own. From these he is able to think and will, also to speak and act. And what he thinks, wills, speaks and does from them, appears as if it were from himself. This causes reciprocity by which there is conjunction. In so far, however, as an angel believes that love and wisdom are in him, and thus claims them to himself as his own, so far the angelic is not in Him and therefore to that extent he has no conjunction with the Lord. For he is not in the truth; and because truth makes one with the light of heaven, to that extent he cannot be in heaven. For he thereby denies that he lives from the Lord, and believes that he lives from himself, consequently that the Divine essence is his. In these two, liberty and rationality, consists the life which is called angelic and human. From these things it can be established that an angel has reciprocity for the sake of conjunction with the Lord, but that this reciprocity viewed in its own aspect, is not his, but the Lord's. Hence it is that if he abuses this reciprocity by which he perceives and feels as his own what is the Lord's, which is done by appropriating it to himself, he falls away from the angelic state. The Lord Himself teaches in John (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-24</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">15:4-6</a>) that conjunction is reciprocal; also that conjunction of the Lord with man, and of man with the Lord, is in those things of the Lord which are called His words, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_7.htm">John 15:7</a>. </p>

116. It shall now be explained how it comes that an angel perceives and feels as his, and thus receives and retains that which yet is not his; for, as was said above, an angel is not an angel from what is his, but from those things which he has from the Lord. The essence of the matter is this:- Every angel has freedom and rationality; these two he has to the end that he may be capable of receiving love and wisdom from the Lord. Yet neither of these, freedom nor rationality, is his, they are the Lord's in him. But since the two are intimately conjoined to his life, so intimately that they may be said to be joined into it, they appear to be his own. It is from them that he is able to think and will, and to speak and act; and what he thinks, wills, speaks, and does from them, appears as if it were from himself. This gives him the ability to reciprocate, and by means of this conjunction is possible. Yet so far as an angel believes that love and wisdom are really in him, and thus lays claim to them for himself as if they were his, so far the angelic is not in him, and therefore he has no conjunction with the Lord; for he is not in truth, and as truth makes one with the light of heaven, so far he cannot be in heaven; for he thereby denies that he lives from the Lord, and believes that he lives from himself, and that he therefore possesses Divine essence. In these two, freedom and rationality, the life which is called angelic and human consists. From all this it can be seen that for the sake of conjunction with the Lord, - the angel has the ability to reciprocate, but that this ability, in itself considered, is not his but the Lord's. From this it is, that if he abuses his ability to reciprocate, by which he perceives and feels as his what is the Lord's, which is done by appropriating it to himself he falls from the angelic state. That conjunction is reciprocal, the Lord Himself teaches (John <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm" target=_top>14:20-24</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm" target=_top>15:4-6</a>); also that the conjunction of the Lord with man and of man with the Lord, is in those things of the Lord that are called His words (John <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_7.htm" target=_top>15:7</a>). </p>

<p>116. Sed quomodo hoc fit, quod Angelus percipiat et sentiat ut suum, et sic recipiat et retineat, cum tamen non ejus est, nam supra dictum est, quod Angelus non sit Angelus a suo, sed ab illis quae apud eum sunt ex Domino, nunc dicetur; res in se talis est; est apud unumquemvis angelum Liberum et Rationalitas; haec duo sunt apud illum propterea ut receptibilis amoris et sapientiae a Domino sit; sed utrumque, tam Liberum quam Rationalitas, non est illius, sed est Domini apud illum; at quia illa duo intime conjuncta sunt vitae ejus, ita intime ut dici queant vitae injuncta, ideo illa apparent sicut propria ejus; ex illis potest cogitare et velle, ac loqui et agere, et quod ex illis cogitat, vult, loquitur et agit, apparet sicut a se: hoc facit reciprocum, per quod conjunctio.<p> </p>
<p>[2] At usque quantum Angelus credit, quod amor et sapientia sint in illo, et sic vindicat illa sibi ut sua, tantum non est Angelicum in illo, et inde tantum non est conjunctio ejus cum Domino; non enim est in veritate; et quia veritas cum luce coeli unum facit, tantum non potest esse in coelo; ex eo enim negat, quod vivat ex Domino, et credit quod vivat ex se, consequenter quod Divina essentia illi sit; in illis duobus, Libero et Rationalitate, consistit vita, quae vocatur angelica et humana.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Ex his constare potest, quod Angelo sit reciprocum propter conjunctionem cum Domino, sed quod reciprocum in sua facultate spectatum non sit ejus sed Domini: inde est, si reciproco illo, a quo percipit et sentit sicut suum quod est Domini, abutitur, quod fit appropriando illud sibi, quod decidat ab angelico. Quod conjunctio reciproca sit, docet Ipse Dominus apud Johannem, Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_116/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_20" target=_top>Johannem 14:20</a> ad 24, Cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_116/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_4-6" target=_top>Johannem 15:4-6</a> ac quod conjunctio Domini cum homine, et hominis cum Domino, sit in illis quae Domini sunt, quae vocantur verba Ipsius, Joh. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_116/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_7" target=_top>Johannem 15:7</a>. </p>
