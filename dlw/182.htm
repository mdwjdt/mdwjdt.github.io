<h4 align="center"></h4><p>182、但属灵之热的层级无法凭经验描述，因为与属灵之热相对应的爱不在思维观念的范畴之内。不过，属灵之光的层级可以描述出来，因为光属于思维，因而在思维观念的范畴之内。然而，属灵之热的层级可通过它们与光之层级的关系来理解，因为这二者处于同一层级。关于天使所在的属灵之光，我被恩准亲眼看见它。围绕高层天堂天使的光如此亮白，难以形容，堪比雪的亮白，且闪闪发光，无以言表，堪比这个世界的太阳光芒。总之，这光胜过世上正午之光千倍。<br><br>另一方面，围绕低层天堂天使的光可通过对比在某种程度上描述出来，尽管它依旧胜过我们世界最强烈的光。高层天堂天使的光之所以无法形容，是因为他们的光与他们的智慧合而为一；还因为相比世人的智慧，他们的智慧是不可言喻的，他们的光也是如此。由此可见，光必有层级之分；由于智慧与爱属同一层级，故可推知热也必有同样的层级之分。</p>

182. However, the levels of spiritual warmth cannot be described on the basis of experience because the love to which spiritual warmth corresponds does not fit into the images of our thought. Still, the levels of spiritual light can be described because light does fit. It is actually an attribute of thought. On the basis of levels of light, we can understand levels of spiritual warmth, since warmth and light are on comparable levels.<p>As for the spiritual light that surrounds angels, I have been allowed to see this with my own eyes. For angels of the higher heavens, the light is so brilliant that it is indescribable, even by comparison with the brilliance of snow; and it also has a glow that defies description, even by comparison with the radiant glory of our world's sun. In short, this light is a thousand times greater than the light at noon on earth. The light of angels of the lower heavens can in some measure be described by comparisons, though. Even so, it surpasses the highest level of light on earth.<p>The reason the light of angels of the higher heavens defies description is that this light is integral to their wisdom. Since their wisdom, relative to ours, is inexpressible, so is their light.<p>We can tell from these few facts that there are levels of light; and since wisdom and love occur on comparable levels, it follows that there are similar levels of warmth. </p>

<p>182. Degrees of spiritual warmth, however, cannot be described from experience, because love - to which spiritual warmth corresponds - does not fall in the same way within the realm of cognitive ideas. But degrees of spiritual light can be described, because light does fall within that realm, since it is connected with thought. Still, from degrees of light, degrees of spiritual warmth can be comprehended, for the two exist in a like degree.<p>As regards the spiritual light possessed by angels, therefore, this I have been granted to see with my own eyes. The light surrounding angels of the higher heavens is so bright that its brilliance cannot be described, not even in comparison to the brightness of snow, and it is at the same time so glowing that neither can its glow be described, not even in comparison to the radiance of the world's sun. In short, that light is a thousand times greater than the light at midday on earth.<p> </p>
<p>[2] On the other hand, the light surrounding angels of the lower heavens can to some extent be described by comparison, but still it is greater than the most intense light of our world.<p>The reason the light of angels in the higher heavens cannot be described is that their light goes hand in hand with their wisdom; and because their wisdom in comparison to the wisdom of people is indescribable, so, too, is their light.<p>From these few observations it can be seen that there are degrees of light. And because wisdom and love exist in a like degree, it follows as a consequence that there are similar degrees of warmth. </p>

<p>182. But degrees of spiritual heat cannot be described from experience because love to which spiritual heat corresponds does not fall thus within ideas of thought. But degrees of spiritual light can be described because light, pertaining to thought, does fall within its ideas. From the degrees of light the degrees of spiritual heat can even be comprehended for they are in a like degree. Therefore with regard to the spiritual light in which angels are, it has been granted me to see this with my eyes. With angels of the higher heavens, the light is so shining white as to be indescribable, even by comparison with the shining whiteness of snow, and so glowing as to be indescribable even by comparison with a beam of light of the world's sun. In a word, that light exceeds by a thousand variations the mid-day light upon earth. But the light with angels of the lower heavens can, to a certain extent, be described by means of comparisons, although it still exceeds the most intense light of our world. The light of the angels of the higher heavens is indescribable for the reason that their light makes one with their wisdom, and because their wisdom, relatively to the wisdom of men, is ineffable, thus also is their light. From these few things, it can be established that there are degrees of light; and because wisdom and love are in similar degree, it follows that there are similar degrees of heat. </p>

182. But degrees of spiritual heat cannot be described from experience, because love, to which spiritual heat corresponds, does not come thus under ideas of thought; but degrees of spiritual light can be described, because light pertains to thought, and therefore comes under ideas of thought. Yet degrees of spiritual heat can be comprehended by their relation to the degrees of light, for the two are in like degree. With respect then to spiritual light in which angels are, it has been granted me to see it with my eyes. With angels of the higher heavens, the light is so glistening white as to be indescribable, even by comparison with the shining whiteness of snow, and so glowing as to be indescribable even by comparison with the beams of this world's sun. In a word, that light exceeds a thousand times the noonday light upon earth. But the light with angels of the lower heavens can be described in a measure by comparisons, although it still exceeds the most intense light of our world. The light of angels of the higher heavens is indescribable, because their light makes one with their wisdom; and because their wisdom, compared to the wisdom of men, is ineffable, thus also is their light. From these few things it can be seen that there must be degrees of light; and because wisdom and love are of like degrees, it follows that there must be like degrees of heat. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #182 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>182. Sed gradus caloris spiritualis non possunt ab experientia describi, quia amor, cui calor spiritualis correspondet, non ita cadit sub ideas cogitationis, sed gradus lucis spiritualis possunt describi, quia lux cadit, est enim haec cogitationis; ex gradibus lucis usque comprehendi possunt gradus caloris spiritualis, sunt enim in parili gradu. Quod itaque Lucem spiritualem, in qua sunt Angeli, attinet, hanc datum est oculis meis videre: Lux apud Angelos superiorum Coelorum tam candida est, ut non describi possit, ne quidem per candorem nivis, et quoque tam rutilans, ut nec describi possit, ne quidem per jubar solis mundi; verbo, Lux illa millenis vicibus excedit lucem meridianam in terris.<p> </p>
<p>[2] At Lux apud Angelos inferiorum coelorum aliquantum potest per comparationes describi, sed usque excedit summam lucem nostri mundi. Quod Lux Angelorum superiorum Coelorum non describi possit, est causa, quia Lux illorum unum facit cum sapientia illorum, et quia sapientia illorum est respective ad sapientiam hominum ineffabilis, ita quoque est lux. Ex his paucis constare potest, quod gradus lucis dentur; et quia sapientia et amor in simili gradu sunt, consequitur quod similes gradus caloris dentur. </p>
