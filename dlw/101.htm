<h4 align="center"></h4><p>101、这热与光，或来自显为太阳的主的属灵发出构成一体，这一点可通过自然界的太阳发出的热与光来说明。这二者在从那太阳发出时也是构成一体的。它们在地球上并未构成一体，原因不在于太阳，而在于地球。因为地球日复一日地绕轴自转，年复一年地沿黄道公转，这造成的表象是，热与光并未构成一体。因为在盛夏，热多于光；而在隆冬，光多于热。<br><br>灵界也一样，只是那里没有地球日复一日的自转或年复一年的公转；只有天使转向主多一点或少一点。那些转向主多一点的天使接受的热多，光相对少一些；而那些转向主少一点的天使接受的光多，热相对少一些。正因如此，由天使组成的天堂分为两个国度，一个被称为“属天的”，一个被称为“属灵的”。属天天使接受更多的热，属灵天使接受更多的光。此外，他们所在之地表面上照他们对热与光的接受而各不相同。只要将地球运动替换成天使的这种状态变化，就会有一个完整的对应关系。</p>

101. The oneness of [spiritual] warmth and light (that is, of the spiritual [energy] that emanates from the Lord as the sun) can be illustrated by the warmth and light that emanate from the sun of our physical world. These "two" are also a single whole as they radiate from the sun. The reason they are not a single whole on earth is to be found in the earth itself, not in the sun. The earth rotates daily on its axis and follows its annual ecliptic orbit. This is why its warmth and light do not seem to be a single whole, why there is more warmth than light in midsummer and more light than warmth in midwinter. The same thing happens in the spiritual world. While the earth there does not rotate or follow an orbit, angels do turn more and less toward the Lord. The ones who turn more toward him accept more of the warmth and less of the light; while the ones who turn less toward the Lord accept more of the light and less of the warmth. This is why the heavens, which are made up of angels, are marked off into two kingdoms, one called "heavenly" and the other called "spiritual." Heavenly angels accept more of the warmth and spiritual angels accept more of the light.<p>The regions where angels live also look different depending on their acceptance of the warmth and light. The correspondence is exact, provided we think of angels' change of state instead of earthly motion. </p>

<p>101. That the heat and light or spiritual essence emanating from the Lord as the sun are united may be illustrated by the heat and light which emanate from the sun in the natural world. These two are also united as they radiate from that sun. That they are not united on earth is owing not to the sun but to the earth. For the earth turns daily on its axis and travels annually along the ecliptic in its orbit about the sun. This produces the appearance that heat and light are not united; for in the middle of summer we have more heat than light, and in the middle of winter more light than heat.<p> </p>
<p>[2] It is the same in the spiritual world, only the earth there does not rotate or orbit the sun, but angels turn themselves more or less directly toward the Lord. Those who turn themselves more directly to Him receive more warmth and less light, while those who turn themselves less directly to Him receive more light and less warmth. So it is that the heavens formed of angels have been distinguished into two kingdoms, one of which we call celestial, and the other spiritual. Celestial angels receive more warmth, and spiritual angels more light.<p>The appearance of the lands on which they dwell also varies in accordance with their reception of heat and light.<p>There is a complete correspondence, provided one substitutes for the motion of the earth a variation in the state of the angels. </p>

<p>101. That the heat and light, that is, the spiritual going forth from the Lord as a Sun, make one, may be illustrated by the heat and light which go forth from the sun of the natural world. These two also make one in their going out from that sun. That they do not make one on the earth is due not to that sun but to the earth. For the earth revolves daily round its axis, and once a year makes a circuit following the ecliptic. From this the appearance is that heat and light do not make one, for in the middle of summer there is more heat than light, and in the middle of winter there is more light than heat. It is the same in the spiritual world. There, however, there is no revolving or circuiting earth, but the angels turn themselves more towards the Lord or less towards Him. Those who turn more receive more from heat and less from light, while those who turn less towards the Lord receive more from light and less from heat. This is the reason that the heavens which consist of angels are distinguished into two kingdoms, one of which is called celestial and the other spiritual. The celestial angels receive more from heat and the spiritual angels more from light. In accordance with their reception of heat and light, so the lands on which they dwell appear. The correspondence is complete if only in place of the motion of the earth there is substituted the change of state of the angels. </p>

101. That heat and light, that is, the spiritual going forth from the Lord as a Sun, make one, may be illustrated by the heat and light that go forth from the sun of the natural world. These two also make one in their going out from that sun. That they do not make one on earth is owing not to the sun, but to the earth. For the earth revolves daily round its axis, and has a yearly motion following the ecliptic, which gives the appearance that heat and light do not make one. For in the middle of summer there is more of heat than of light, and in the middle of winter more of light than of heat. In the spiritual world it is the same, except that there is in that world no daily or yearly motion of the earth; but the angels turn themselves, some more, some less, to the Lord; those who turn themselves more, receive more from heat and less from light, and those who turn themselves less to the Lord receive more from light and less from heat. From this it is that the heavens, which consist of angels, are divided into two kingdoms, one called celestial, the other spiritual. The celestial angels receive more from heat, and the spiritual angels more from light. Moreover, the lands they inhabit vary in appearance according to their reception of heat and light. If this change of state of the angels is substituted for the motion of the earth, the correspondence is complete. </p>

<p>101. Quod Calor et Lux, hoc est, Spirituale procedens a Domino ut Sole, unum faciant, illustrari potest per calorem et lucem, quae procedunt a Sole Mundi naturalis; illa duo etiam unum faciunt in exeundo a Sole illo: quod non unum faciant in terris, non est ex Sole illo, sed ex Tellure; haec enim quotidie volvitur circum axem, et quotannis circumfertur secundum Ecclipticam; inde apparentia est quod Calor et Lux non unum faciant, media enim aestate est plus caloris quam lucis, et media hyeme est plus lucis quam caloris:<p> </p>
<p>[2] simile est in Mundo spirituali; sed tellus ibi non circumvolvitur et circumfertur, verum Angeli plus et minus se convertunt ad Dominum, et qui plus se convertunt, plus ex calore et minus ex luce recipiunt, et qui minus se convertunt ad Dominum, plus ex luce et minus ex calore recipiunt; inde est quod Coeli, qui ex Angelis sunt, distincti sint in duo Regna, quorum unum vocatur Coeleste, alterum Spirituale; Angeli coelestes plus recipiunt ex calore, et Angeli spirituales plus ex luce. Secundum receptionem caloris et lucis ab illis apparent quoque terrae, super quibus habitant. Plenaria est correspondentia, modo loco motus telluris sumatur mutatio status angelorum. </p>
