<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">3.9 高度层级以完全和能力存在于其最终层级中</h4><p>217、我们在前一章已说明，最终层级是在先层级的复合物、容器和基础。由此可推知，在先层级以其完全存在于其最终层级中，因为它们存在于其结果中，每个结果都是原因的完全实现。</p>

217. The vertical levels find their full realization and power in their final form. I explained in the preceding section that the final level is the composite and vessel of the prior levels. It follows from this that the prior levels find their full realization in their final level. That is where they are in their effect, and every effect is a summary of its causes. </p>

217. Degrees of height exist in their fullness and power in their last degree. In the preceding discussion we showed that the last degree embraces and contains the prior degrees. It follows as a consequence that the prior degrees exist in their fullness in their last degree; for they then exist in their effect, and every effect is the full realization of causes. </p>

217. DEGREES OF HEIGHT ARE IN FULNESS AND IN POWER IN THEIR ULTIMATE <p>In the preceding section it was shown that the ultimate degree is the complex and containant of prior degrees. Hence it follows that prior degrees are in fulness in their ultimate, for they are in their effect, and every effect is the fulness of causes. </p>

<p>
217. THE DEGREES OF HEIGHT ARE IN FULLNESS AND IN POWER IN THEIR OUTMOST DEGREE. <p>In the preceding chapter it is shown that the outmost degree is the complex and containant of prior degrees. From this it follows that prior degrees are in their fullness in their outmost degree, for they are in their effect, and every effect is the fullness of causes. </p>

217. QUOD GRADUS ALTITUDINIS IN SUO ULTIMO SINT IN PLENO ET IN POTENTIA. In praecedente Articulo ostensum est, quod Gradus ultimus sit complexus et continens graduum priorum; inde sequitur, quod Gradus priores in suo Ultimo sint in pleno; sunt enim in suo effectu, et omnis effectus est causarum plenum. </p>
