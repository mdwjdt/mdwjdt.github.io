<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第239节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>239、既然人里面有爱、智慧、因而功用的三个层级，那么可推知，他里面必有意愿、理解力，由此而来的结果，因而达到功用目的的决心的三个层级。因为意愿是爱的容器，理解力是智慧的容器，结果是来自爱和智慧的功用。由此明显可知，每个人里面都有一个属世、属灵和属天的意愿和理解力，出生时是潜在的，当它们被打开时则是实际的。<br><br>一言以蔽之，由意愿和理解力构成的人之心智，自创造，因而自出生时就具有三个层级，以便人有一个属世心智、一个属灵心智和一个属天心智，由此活在世上时就能被提升至天使的智慧并拥有它；不过，只有在死后，且只有成为天使，他才能进入这智慧；到那时，他的言谈对属世人来说是难以形容、无法理解的。<br><br>我认识一个在世时学识一般的人，他死后我在天堂见到他，并与他交谈。那时，我清楚发觉他说话就像一位天使，他所说的话对属世人来说是不可思议的。因为他在世时将圣言的诫命运用于生活，敬拜主，因而被主提升至爱和智慧的第三层级。了解人类心智的这种提升极其重要，因为提升取决于下文所说的理解力。</p>

239. Because there are within us these three levels of love and wisdom and therefore of usefulness, it follows that there are three levels of volition and discernment and consequent closure, and therefore of concentration within us on usefulness, since volition is the vessel of love, discernment the vessel of wisdom, and closure the usefulness that results from them. We can see from this that there is within each of us an earthly, a spiritual, and a heavenly volition and discernment, potentially from birth, and effectively when they are opened.<p>In short, the human mind, consisting of volition and discernment, has three levels from creation and birth, so we have an earthly mind, a spiritual mind, and a heavenly mind. Consequently, we can be raised into angelic wisdom and possess it even while we are living in this world. Still, we become conscious of it only after death, if we become angels; and then we say inexpressible things, things incomprehensible to an earthly-minded person.<p>I was acquainted with a moderately educated man in the world and saw him and talked with him in heaven after his death. I sensed very clearly that he was talking like an angel and that what he was saying was beyond the grasp of earthly-minded people. The reason was that in the world he had applied the precepts of the Word to his life and had worshiped the Lord; so the Lord had raised him into the third level of love and wisdom.<p>It is important to know about this raising up of the human mind, since understanding what follows depends on it. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #239 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>239. Since a person has in him three degrees of love and wisdom and consequent useful endeavor, it follows that he has in him three degrees of will and intellect and consequent resolve, and thus of a determination to a useful end. For the will is the receptacle of love, and the intellect the receptacle of wisdom, and the resolve is the useful result springing from them. It is apparent in consequence of this that every person has in him a natural, spiritual and celestial will and intellect, potentially from birth, and actually as they are opened.<p> </p>
<p>[2] In a word, from creation and thus from birth, the human mind, which consists of will and intellect, exists in three degrees, so that a person has a natural mind, a spiritual mind, and a celestial mind. Moreover, a person can in consequence of this be raised into angelic wisdom and possess it while he lives in the world, even though he does not come into it until after death, if he becomes an angel, at which time he then speaks things inexpressible and incomprehensible to a natural person.<p> </p>
<p>[3] I knew a person of average learning in the world, and after his death I saw and spoke with him in heaven. I clearly perceived then that he spoke as an angel, and that the things he said would be unintelligible to a natural person. The reason was that in the world he had applied the precepts of the Word to life and had worshiped the Lord, and so had been raised by the Lord into the third degree of love and wisdom.<p>It is important that this elevation of the human mind be known, for on it depends an understanding of the discussions that follow. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #239 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>239. Since the three degrees of love and wisdom and hence of use must be in man, it follows that there must be in him three degrees of will, and of understanding, and hence of conclusion and so of determination towards use. For the will is the receptacle of love, the understanding the receptacle of wisdom, and conclusion is use from these. From this it is evident that, in every man, there is a natural, a spiritual and a celestial will and understanding in potency from birth, and in act when they are opened. In a word, the mind of man which consists of will and understanding, is, from creation and therefore from birth, of three degrees so that man has a natural mind, a spiritual mind, and a celestial mind, and can thereby be raised into, and possess angelic wisdom while he lives in the world. But yet he comes into that wisdom only after death, if he becomes an angel, and then he speaks things ineffable and incomprehensible to the natural man. I knew a man of mediocre learning in the world whom I saw after death and with whom I spoke in heaven, and I clearly perceived that he spoke like an angel, and that the things he said would be imperceptible to the natural man. The reason was that in the world he had applied to life the precepts of the Word, and had worshipped the Lord, and hence he was raised up by the Lord into the third degree of love and wisdom. It matters that this elevation of the mind should be known, for upon it depends an understanding of what follows. </p>

239. Since there are in man three degrees of love and wisdom, and therefore of use, it follows that there must be in him three degrees, of will, of understanding, and of result therefrom, thus of determination to use; for will is the receptacle of love, understanding the receptacle of wisdom, and result is use from these. From this it is evident that there are in every man a natural, a spiritual, and a celestial will and understanding, potentially by birth and actually when they are opened. In a word the mind of man, which consists of will and understanding, is from creation and therefore from birth, of three degrees, so that man has a natural mind, a spiritual mind, and a celestial mind, and can thereby be elevated into and possess angelic wisdom while he lives in the world; but it is only after death, and then only if he becomes an angel, that he enters into that wisdom, and his speech then becomes ineffable and incomprehensible to the natural man. I knew a man of moderate learning in the world, whom I saw after death and spoke with in heaven, and I clearly perceived that he spoke like an angel, and that the things he said would be inconceivable to the natural man; and for the reason that in the world he had applied the precepts of the Word to life and had worshiped the Lord, and was therefore raised up by the Lord into the third degree of love and wisdom. It is important that this elevation of the human mind should be known about, for upon it depends the understanding of what follows. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #239 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>239. Quoniam tres gradus amoris et sapientiae et inde usus dantur apud hominem, sequitur quod tres Gradus Voluntatis ac Intellectus et inde Conclusi, et sic Determinationis ad usum, dentur apud illum, nam Voluntas est receptaculum amoris, et Intellectus receptaculum sapientiae, ac Conclusum est usus ex illis: ex quibus patet, quod apud unumquemvis hominem sit voluntas et intellectus naturalis, spiritualis et coelestis in potentia a nativitate, et in actu dum aperiuntur.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Verbo, Mens hominis, quae consistit ex voluntate et intellectu, ex creatione et inde ex nativitate est trium graduum, ita quod homini sit Mens naturalis, Mens spiritualis et Mens coelestis, et quod homo per id elevari possit in sapientiam angelicam, ac illam possidere quando in Mundo vivit, sed usque in illam non venit nisi quam post mortem, si fit Angelus, et tunc loquitur ineffabilia et naturali homini incomprehensibilia.<p> </p>
<p>[3] Cognovi hominem mediocriter doctum in Mundo, et post mortem vidi illum et loquutus sum cum illo in Coelo, et clare percepi quod loquutus sit sicut Angelus, et quod illa quae loquutus est, homini naturali imperceptibilia essent: causa erat, quia in Mundo praecepta Verbi applicuerat vitae, et coluerat Dominum, et inde a Domino in tertium Gradum amoris et sapientiae elevatus est. Interest ut haec elevatio mentis humanae sciatur, inde enim pendet intellectus sequentium. </p>
