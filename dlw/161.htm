<h4 align="center"></h4><p>161、时间同样固定不变，它们也是自然界的属性。一天的时长总是二十四小时，一年的时长总是三百六十五又四分之一天。造成这些时间上的间隔变化的光暗冷热状态也有规律地循环往复。每日循环的周期是早、午、晚、夜，每年循环的周期是春、夏、秋、冬。而且，一年四季有规律地调节一日四时。所有这些状态同样都是死的，因为跟灵界不同，它们并非生命的状态。在灵界，光和热持续存在；光对应于天使的智慧的状态，热对应于天使的爱的状态；因此，他们所经历的这些状态是生命的状态。</p>

161. Since times are similarly stable and constant, they too are proper to nature. The length of a day is always twenty-four hours and the length of a year is always three hundred and sixty-five days. The actual states of light, darkness, warmth, and cold that make these differences are constantly returning as well. The states that return every day are morning, noon, evening, and night; the states of the year are spring, summer, fall, and winter. Then too, the states of the year are constantly altering the states of the days. All of these states, since they are not states of life like the ones in the spiritual world, are lifeless. That is, in the spiritual world there is a constant light and a constant warmth. The light is responsive to the state of wisdom among the angels, and the warmth to the state of their love. As a result, these states are alive. </p>

161. Since intervals of time are likewise set and constant, they are also properties of nature; for the duration of a day is constantly twenty-four hours, and the duration of a year is constantly 365 1/4 days.<p>The periods of light and darkness and of warmth and coldness, which cause these intervals to vary in character, themselves recur in constant cycles. The periods which recur in cycles every day are morning, afternoon, evening and night. The periods which recur in cycles every year are spring, summer, fall and winter. The seasons of the year also constantly vary the hours of daylight.<p>Because these periods are not states of life as in the spiritual world, they too are all lifeless. For one finds in the spiritual world a constant light and constant warmth, the light corresponding to the state of wisdom in angels, and the warmth to the state of love, so that the states they pass through are states of life. </p>

<p>
161. Since times in like manner are settled and constant, they are also proper to nature, for the duration of a day is constantly of twenty-four hours, and the period of a year is constantly of three hundred and sixty-five and a quarter days. The very states of light and shade, and of heat and cold which make these periods vary, are also constant in their recurrence. The states which recur daily are morning, noon, evening and night, and those which recur yearly are spring, summer, autumn and winter. The states of the year also constantly vary the states of the days. All these states are also dead, because they are not states of life as in the spiritual world. For in the spiritual world there is continuous light and continuous heat, the light corresponding to states of wisdom, and the heat to states of love with the angels; wherefore the states of these are living. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #161 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
161. Since times in like manner are settled and constant, they also are a property of nature; for the length of a day is constantly twenty-four hours, and the length of a year is constantly three hundred and sixty-five days and a quarter. The very states of light and shade, and of heat and cold, which cause these periods to vary, are also regular in their return. The states which recur daily are morning, noon, evening, and night; those recurring yearly are spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Moreover, the annual states modify regularly the daily states. All these states are likewise dead because they are not states of life, as in the spiritual world; for in the spiritual world there is continuous light and there is continuous heat, the light corresponding to the state of wisdom, and the heat to the state of love with the angels; consequently the states of these are living. </p>

<p>
161. Quoniam Tempora similiter stata et constantia sunt, etiam illa sunt propria naturae, nam Tempus diei est constanter 24 horarum, et Tempus anni est constanter 365 1/4 dierum: ipsi Status lucis et umbrae, ac caloris et frigoris, qui variant illa, constanter etiam redeunt; Status qui redeunt quovis die, sunt mane, meridies, vespera et nox; et quovis anno sunt ver, aestas, autumnus et hyems; status anni etiam constanter variant status dierum: omnes hi Status, quia non sunt Status vitae, ut in Mundo spirituali, sunt quoque mortui; nam in Mundo spirituali est continua Lux et continuus Calor, ac Lux correspondet statui sapientiae, et Calor statui amoris[,] apud angelos, ex quo horum status sunt vivi. </p>
