<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">3.12 每个人生来都有这三个高度层级，它们可依次被打开；随着它们被打开，人在主里面，主在人里面</h4><p>236、每个人里面都有三个高度层级，这一事实至今不为人知。因为这些层级还没有得到认识，只要注意不到它们，人们就只知道连续层级；只知道连续层级，就会以为爱和智慧在人里面仅仅是连续增长。然而，要知道，每个人生来就有三个高度或离散层级，一层在另一层之上或之内。此外，高度或离散层级的各个层级也都有广度层级或连续层级，并照之连续增长。因为这两种层级存在于一切最大和最小事物中(如222-229节所示)。事实上，这种层级离开那种层级无法存在。</p>

236. These three vertical levels exist in each of us from birth and can be opened in sequence. As they are opened, we are in the Lord and the Lord is in us. The existence of three vertical levels in us has not been widely recognized before. This is because vertical levels themselves have not been identified, and as long as these levels have been unrecognized, the only levels people could know about are the gradual ones. When these are the only levels people know about, they can believe that our love and wisdom increase only gradually.<p>It needs to be realized, though, that we all have these three vertical or distinct levels in us from our birth, one above or within the other, and that each vertical or distinct level has horizontal or gradual levels by which it increases incrementally. This is because there are both kinds of level in everything, no matter how large or small, as explained above in <a href="222.htm" target=_top>222-229</a>. Neither kind of level can exist apart from the other. </p>

236. These three degrees of height exist in every person from birth and can be progressively opened, and as they are opened, the person is in the Lord and the Lord in him. The fact that there are in every person three degrees of height has not been known before. The reason is that these degrees have gone unrecognized, and as long as these degrees have escaped notice, the only degrees that could be known are continuous degrees; and when these are the only degrees known, one may believe that love and wisdom in a person grow only by a continuous progression.<p>It should be known, however, that every person has in him from birth three degrees of height or discrete degrees, one above or within another. Moreover, each degree of height or discrete degree contains as well degrees of breadth or continuous degrees, according to which it grows through a continuous progression. For degrees of both kinds exist in the greatest and least of all things, as we showed above in nos. <a href="222.htm">222-229</a>. Indeed, a degree of the one kind cannot exist without the other. </p>

236. THESE THREE DEGREES OF HEIGHT ARE IN EVERY MAN FROM BIRTH, AND CAN BE OPENED SUCCESSIVELY, AND AS THEY ARE OPENED, MAN IS IN THE LORD AND THE LORD IN MAN <p>It has not hitherto been made known that there are three degrees of height in every man for the reason that these degrees had not been acknowledged. And so long as these degrees were concealed, it was impossible for other than continuous degrees to be known. And when these are the only degrees known, it can be imagined that love and wisdom with man increase only by continuity. But it ought to be known that with every man from birth there are three degrees of height, or discrete degrees, one above or within another; and that every degree of height, or discrete degree, has also degrees of breadth, or continuous <p>Degrees, according to which it increases by continuity. For there are degrees of both kinds in greatest and least things of everything, as was shown above (<a href="222.htm">222-229</a>). For no degree of one kind is possible without degrees of the other kind. </p>

236. THESE THREE DEGREES OF HEIGHT ARE IN EVERY MAN FROM BIRTH, AND CAN BE OPENED SUCCESSIVELY; AND, AS THEY ARE OPENED, MAN IS IN THE LORD AND THE LORD IN MAN. <p>That there are three degrees of height in every man, has not until now become known for the reason that these degrees have not been recognized, and so long as they remained unnoticed, none but continuous degrees could be known; and when none but continuous degrees are known, it may be supposed that love and wisdom increase in man only by continuity. But it should be known, that in every man from his birth there are three degrees of height, or discrete degrees, one above or within another; and that each degree of height, or discrete degree, has also degrees of breadth, or continuous degrees, according to which it increases by continuity. For there are degrees of both kinds in things greatest and least of all things (as was shown above, n. <a href="222.htm" target=_top>222-229</a>); for no degree of one kind is possible without degrees of the other kind. </p>

236. QUOD TRES ILLI GRADUS ALTITUDINIS IN QUOVIS HOMINE A NATIVITATE SINT, ET QUOD SUCCESSIVE POSSINT APERIRI, ET QUOD SICUT APERIUNTUR, HOMO IN DOMINO SIT, ET DOMINUS IN ILLO. Quod tres Gradus altitudinis in quovis homine sint, hactenus non innotuit; causa est, quia <sup>1</sup>
illi Gradus non cogniti fuerunt, et quamdiu illi Gradus latuerunt, non possunt alii Gradus sciri, quam Gradus continui; et cum hi Gradus solum sciuntur, credi potest, quod amor et sapientia apud hominem modo per continuum crescant. At sciendum est, quod apud unumquemvis hominem a nativitate tres Gradus altitudinis seu discreti sint, unus supra aut intra alterum: et quod unusquisque gradus altitudinis seu discretus etiam habeat Gradus latitudinis seu continuos, secundum quos ille crescit per continuum, nam utriusque generis Gradus in omnium maximis et minimis sunt, ut supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_236/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_222" target=_top>222-229</a> <sup>2</sup>
ostensum est; non enim potest dari unius generis Gradus absque altero. <p>
