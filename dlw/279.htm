<h4 align="center"></h4><p>279、以下观察证实了这一点：与一个人同在的天使们分别感知行为中来自心智的事物，属灵天使感知其中来自理解力的事物，属天天使感知其中来自意愿的事物。这一点看似难以置信，却是事实。然而，要知道，当某个主题正在考虑中，或呈现于脑海时，适合该主题的心智事物在中间，其余的则根据它们的相关程度而在这些事物的周围。天使声称，他们单从一个动作就能感知到一个人的性格，尽管其爱的样子照着它进入情感并由此进入思维的决定而变化。简言之，在天使眼里，属灵人的一切动作或行为都像美味、有用和美丽的果实；当打开食用时，它就生出香味、功用和快乐。天使对人的动作和行为就具有这种感知(参看220节)。</p>

279. In support of this is the fact that the angels who are with us are aware in detail of the actions of our minds within our deeds. Spiritual angels perceive what is enclosed from our discernment, and heavenly angels what is enclosed from our volition. This may seem like a paradox, but it is true. It does need to be realized, though, that the mental elements involved in a contemplated or present deed are in the center, with the rest surrounding in proportion to their relevance.<p>Angels say that they perceive what someone is like from a single deed, though the image of someone's love will vary depending on the way it finds definition in desires and therefore in thoughts. In brief, every one of the acts or deeds of a spiritual person is like a delicious, nourishing, and beautiful fruit to angels, a fruit that yields flavor, nourishment, and pleasure when it is sliced and eaten.<p>On angels' having this kind of perception of our actions and deeds, see <a href="220.htm" target=_top>220</a> above. </p>

279. This is confirmed by the following observation, that the angels who are with a person perceive individually the particular qualities which are present from the mind in an action. Spiritual angels perceive those qualities which are present in it from the intellect, while celestial angels perceive those qualities which are present in it from the will. This appears to be a contradictory statement, but still it is the truth.<p>It should nevertheless be known that those elements of the mind which are applicable to a subject presented for consideration or under consideration are at the center, while the rest are positioned round about according to their relevance.<p>Angels say that they perceive a person's character from a single act, though in a varying likeness of his love according to its determinations into affections and so into thoughts.<p>In a word, every action or every work of a spiritual person is, in the sight of angels, like a flavorful, useful, and beautiful fruit, which when opened and eaten yields flavor, utility, and delight.<p>That angels' perception of a person's actions and works is as described may also be seen above in no. <a href="220.htm">220</a>. </p>

279. This is confirmed by the following. The angels who are with man perceive separately those things which are from the mind in an act, the spiritual angels perceiving those things therein which are from the will. This appears as a paradox but yet it is true. It is to be known, however, that the things of the mind pertaining to any proposition under consideration or present in the mind, are in the middle, other things being around them according to affinities. The angels say that a man character is perceived from each single act, but in a likeness of his love, various according to its determinations into affections and into thoughts therefrom. In a word, every act or deed of a spiritual man is, before the angels, like a palatable fruit, useful and beautiful, which when opened and eaten yields flavour, use and delights. It may also be seen above (<a href="220.htm">220</a>) that the angels have such a perception of the acts and deeds of a man. </p>

279. This is corroborated by the following: The angels who are with man perceive separately the things that are from the mind in the act, the spiritual angels perceiving those things therein that are from the understanding, and the celestial angels those things therein that are from the will. This appears incredible, but it is true. It should be known, however, that the things of the mind pertaining to any subject that is under consideration, or before the mind, are in the middle, and the rest are round about these according to their affinities therewith. The angels declare that a man's character is perceived from a single deed, but in a likeness of his love, which varies according to its determinations into affections, and into thoughts therefrom. In a word, before the angels every act or deed of a spiritual man is like a palatable fruit, useful and beautiful, which when opened and eaten yields flavor, use, and delight. That the angels have such a perception of the acts and deeds of men may also be seen above (n. <a href="220.htm" target=_top>220</a>). </p>

279. Hoc confirmatur per haec; quod Angeli qui apud hominem sunt, percipiant <sup>1</sup>
singillatim illa quae ex Mente in actu sunt; Angeli spirituales illa quae inibi ex intellectu sunt, ac Angeli coelestes illa quae inibi ex voluntate sunt: hoc apparet ut paradoxon, sed usque est verum. At sciendum est, quod illa mentis quae sunt rei propositae seu praesentis, sint in medio, et reliqua circum circa secundum affinitates. Angeli dicunt, quod ex singulo opere percipiatur homo qualis est, sed in varia similitudine sui amoris, secundum determinationes ejus in affectiones et inde in cogitationes. Verbo, omnis actus seu omne opus hominis spiritualis coram Angelis est sicut fructus sapidus, utilis et pulcher, qui reclusus et comestus dat saporem, usum, et delitias. Quod Angelis talis perceptio actuum et operum hominis sit, videatur etiam supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_279/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_220" target=_top>220</a>. <p>
