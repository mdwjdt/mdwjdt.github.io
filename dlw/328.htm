<h4 align="center"></h4><p>328、与功用有关的人，不仅指个人，还指群体，以及大大小小的群体，如一个州，一个王国、或帝国，或最大的群体，即整个世界，因为这些群体中的每一个都是一个人。天堂的情况也一样，整个天使天堂在主眼里如同一个人，每一个天堂社群同样是一个人。正因如此，每位天使都是一个人。事实的确如此，这一点可见于《天堂与地狱》一书(68-103节)。这清楚表明下文中的人类是什么意思。</p>

328. By this "human" to whom useful functions relate, I mean not only an individual but also groups of people and smaller and larger communities such as republics and monarchies and empires and even that largest community that comprises the whole world, since all of these are human. So too in the heavens the whole angelic heaven is like a single individual in the Lord's sight, and so is each individual community of heaven. This is why each individual angel is human. On this subject, see <a href="../hh/68.htm" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 68-103</a> [<a href="68.htm" target=_top>68-102</a>]. This shows what is meant by "human" in the following pages. </p>

328. By mankind to whom forms of use have relation we mean not only individuals, but also groups of people and smaller and larger associations of them, such as republics, kingdoms, and empires, as well as the greatest one, which is the entire world; for each of these is a human entity. The case is similar to that in heaven. The entire angelic heaven is in the Lord's sight as though a single person, and likewise every society of heaven. So it is that every angel is a person. (That such is the case may be seen in the book Heaven and Hell, nos. <a href="68.htm">68-102</a>.)<p>It is apparent from this what we mean by mankind in the following considerations. </p>

<p>
328. By man to whom uses have relation is understood not only an individual, but also an assembly of men, also a society, smaller or larger, as a state, kingdom, or empire, or the largest society which is the world, for each of these is a man. Similarly in heaven the whole angelic heaven is as one man before the Lord, and equally each society of heaven. Thus it is that every angel is a man. That this is so may be seen in the work HEAVEN AND HELL (<a href="../hh/68.htm">68-103</a>). From these considerations it is clear what is understood by man in what follows. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #328 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
328. By man, to whom uses have relation, is meant not alone an individual but an assembly of men, also a society smaller or larger, as a commonwealth, kingdom, or empire, or that largest society, the whole world, for each of these is a man. Likewise in the heavens, the whole angelic heaven is as one man before the Lord, and equally every society of heaven; from this it is that every angel is a man. That this is so may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell (n. <a href="../hh/68.htm" target=_top>68-103</a>). This makes clear what is meant by man in what follows. </p>

328. Per hominem, ad quem usus se referunt, intelligitur non solum homo, sed etiam Caetus hominum, ac Societas minor et major, ut Respublica, Regnum et Imperium, ut et Societas maxima quae est Universus Orbis, nam hic et illa sunt Homo: similiter ut in Coelis[;] est universum Coelum angelicum coram Domino ut unus Homo, pariter unaquaevis Societas Coeli[;] inde est, quod unusquisque Angelus sit homo; quod ita sit, videatur in Opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_328/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_68" target=_top>de COELO ET INFERNO 68-102</a>. Ex his patet, quid per hominem in sequentibus intelligitur. </p>
