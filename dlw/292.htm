<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第292节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>292、我常得以感知环绕天使或灵人的这种气场的存在，还感知一个社群里环绕许多人的一种总体气场。我也得以目睹这个气场表现出各种形式，它有时在天堂看似纤细的火焰，在地狱看似密集的大火，有时在天堂看似又薄又亮的白云，在地狱看似又密又黑的雨云。我还被恩准感知这些气场为各种各样的芳香和恶臭。这些经历使我确信，无论在天堂还是地狱，人人都被一种气场环绕，该气场是由从其身体释放并散发出来的物质构成的。</p>

292. I have fairly often been allowed to perceive that there is this kind of aura around an angel or spirit and that there is a general aura around groups in community. I have also been allowed to see this aura in various guises, sometimes in heaven looking like a faint flame and in hell like a harsh flame, sometimes in heaven looking like a delicate and bright cloud and in hell like a dense black cloud. I have also been allowed to sense these auras as different kinds of aroma and stench. This has convinced me that everyone in heaven and everyone in hell is surrounded by an aura made up of substances distilled and separated from his or her body. </p>

292. I have often been given to perceive the existence of such an atmosphere about an angel or spirit, and also the existence of a common atmosphere about many in a society; and I have also been given to see the atmosphere manifested in various guises. In heaven it has looked at times like a slender flame, in hell like a dense fire, and at other times in heaven like a thin white cirrus cloud, and in hell like a dense and dark rain cloud. I have been granted as well to perceive these atmospheres as various kinds of aromas and stenches.<p>As a result of these experiences I have been convinced that everyone in heaven and everyone in hell is surrounded by an atmosphere consisting of substances released and given off from their bodies. </p>

<p>
292. Quite often a perception has been granted me of such a sphere around an angel and spirit, and also a general sphere around many in a society, and I have also been granted to see it under various appearances, in heaven sometimes appearing like a thin flame, in hell like gross fire; in heaven sometimes like a thin and white cloud, and in hell, like a thick and black cloud. It has also been granted me to perceive these spheres as various kinds of odours and stenches. Out of these experiences I was convinced that a sphere derived from substances set free and separated from their bodies, encompasses everyone in heaven and everyone in hell. </p>

<p>
292. A perception has often been granted me of such a sphere around each angel and spirit, and also a general sphere around many in a society. I have also been permitted to see it under various appearances, in heaven sometimes appearing like a thin flame, in hell like gross fire, also sometimes in heaven like a thin and shining white cloud, and in hell like a thick and black cloud. It has also been granted me to perceive these spheres as various kinds of odors and stenches. By these experiences I was convinced that a sphere, consisting of substances set free and separated from- their bodies, encompasses every one in heaven and every one in hell. </p>

292. Saepius datum est percipere, quod talis sphaera sit circum angelum et spiritum, et quoque sphaera communis circum plures in societate, et quoque datum est videre illam sub varia specie, in Coelo quandoque sub specie tenuis flammae, in inferno sub specie crassi ignis; et quandoque in Coelo sub specie tenuis et candidae nubis, et in inferno sub specie crassi et atri nimbi; et quoque datum est sphaeras illas percipere sub varia specie odorum ac nidorum: ex quibus confirmatus sum, quod unumquemvis in Coelo et unumquemvis in inferno sphaera ex substantiis resolutis et separatis a corporibus illorum consistens circumfundat. </p>
