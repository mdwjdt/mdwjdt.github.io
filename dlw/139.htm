<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第139节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>139、朝主的这种实际转向源于爱，同时源于智慧；不是唯独源于爱，也不是唯独源于智慧。唯独爱就像没有显现的存在，因为爱在智慧中有自己的形式；没有爱的智慧就像没有存在的显现，因为智慧从爱中拥有自己的形式。诚然，没有智慧，爱有可能存在；但这种爱是人的，不是主的。没有爱，唯独智慧也是有可能的；但这种智慧虽来自主，却没有主在里面；因为它就像冬天的光，这光虽来自太阳，但太阳的本质，也就是热，却不在它里面。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #139 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
139. This active turning toward the Lord comes from love and wisdom together, not from love alone or wisdom alone. Love alone is like a reality with no manifestation, since love makes itself manifest in wisdom; and wisdom without love is like a manifestation with no reality, since wisdom is the manifestation of love.<p>There is actually a kind of love apart from wisdom, but it is ours and not the Lord's. There is also wisdom apart from love, but while it comes from the Lord, it does not have the Lord within it. It is like sunlight in winter that does of course come from the sun but does not have within it the essence of the sun, its warmth. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #139 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
139. This actual turning to the Lord springs from love and at the same time from wisdom, and not from love alone, nor from wisdom alone. Love alone is like being without its expression, for love has expression in wisdom. And wisdom without love is like expression without its being, for wisdom has being from love.<p>It is possible indeed for love to exist without wisdom, but that is a love found in people and not in the Lord. It is also possible for wisdom to exist without love, but even though that wisdom comes from the Lord, it does not have the Lord in it; for it is like a wintry light which, although emanating from the sun, does not have in it the sun's essence, which is warmth. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #139 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
139. This actual turning to the Lord is from love together with wisdom, not from love alone, nor from wisdom alone. Love alone is like Esse without its Existere for love had its existence in wisdom; and wisdom without love is like Existere without its Esse, for wisdom has its existence from love. Love without wisdom is indeed possible, but such love is man's and not the Lord's. Wisdom is also possible without love, but such wisdom, although from the Lord, has not the Lord in it. For it is like the light of winter which, although from the sun, yet the sun's essence which is heat is not in it. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #139 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
139. This actual turning to the Lord is from love together with Wisdom; not from love alone, nor from wisdom alone; for love alone is like esse [being] without its existere [taking form] since love has its form in wisdom; and wisdom without love is like existere without its esse, since wisdom has its form from love. Love is indeed possible without wisdom; but such love is man's, and not the Lord's. Wisdom alone is possible without love; but such wisdom, although from the Lord, has not the Lord in it; for it is like the light of winter, which is from the sun; still the sun's essence, which is heat, is not in it. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #139 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
139. Conversio illa actualis ad Dominum est ex amore et simul sapientia, non ex solo amore, nec ex sola sapientia[;] solus amor est sicut esse absque suo existere, amor enim existit in sapientia; et sapientia absque amore est sicut existere absque suo esse, sapientia enim existit ex amore. Datur quidem amor absque sapientia, sed ille amor est hominis et non Domini; et quoque datur sapientia absque amore, sed illa sapientia est quidem a Domino, sed non habet Dominum in se, est enim sicut lux hyemalis, quae quidem est a sole, sed tamen solis essentia, quae est calor, non est in illa. </p>
