<h4 align="center"></h4><p>397、为了不让人通过理解力而在天堂，通过意愿而在地狱(这是有可能的)，从而有一个分裂的心智，死后超出自己的爱的理解力部分将被除去。由此而来的结果是，每个人里面的意愿和理解力最终要合而为一。对于天堂里的人来说，意愿热爱良善，理解力思考真理；但对于地狱里的人来说，意愿热爱邪恶，理解力思考虚假。世人在出于他的灵思考时也一样，如当他独自一人时的情形；然而，许多人在肉身期间，如当他们不是独自一人时，却没有这样做的。那时他们没有这样做是因为，他们把自己的理解力提升到了其意愿或灵固有的爱之上。说这些事是为了叫人们知道，意愿和理解力是两个截然不同的实体，尽管它们被造是为了行如一体，并且即便死前它们没有行如一体，死后也要行如一体。</p>

397. To make sure that we are not in heaven as to our discernment, which is possible, and in hell as to our volition, which would give us a mind divided against itself, after death any elements of discernment that transcend our own love are taken away. The result is that for everyone, volition and discernment eventually act in unison. For people in heaven, their volition loves what is good and their discernment thinks what is true. For people in hell, their volition loves what is evil and their discernment thinks what is false.<p>The same holds true for us in this world when we are thinking from the spirit. This happens when we are alone, though many people think differently during their physical lives, when they are not alone. The reason for this difference is that they lift their discernment above the self-concern of their volition, or the love of their spirit.<p>I mention all this to show that volition and discernment are two distinguishable functions, still created to be one function, and that they are constrained to act in unison after death, if not before. </p>

397. So then, to keep a person from being through his intellect in heaven - as is possible - and through his will in hell, and to keep him from having consequently a divided mind, therefore after death everything of the intellect that is above his inherent love is taken away. As a result, the will and intellect in everyone are finally united. In the case of people in heaven, the will loves good and the intellect thinks truth, whereas in the case of people in hell, the will loves evil and the intellect thinks falsity.<p>A person does the like in the world when he thinks from his spirit, which is the case when he is alone, even though many do otherwise when they are present in the body, which is the case when they are not alone. They do otherwise then because they raise their intellect above the inherent love of their will or spirit.<p>This much has been said to make it known that the will and intellect are two distinct entities, and that they nevertheless have been created to be united, and are impelled into union, if not before, still after death. </p>

397. Now in case man through the understanding be in heaven, as is possible, and through the will in hell, and thereby have a divided mind, after death everything that transcends his own particular love is removed; whence it ensues that will and understanding with all men finally act as one. With those who are in heaven, the will loves what is good and the understanding thinks what is true; but with those in hell, the will loves what is evil and the understanding thinks what is false. Man does the same in the world when he thinks from his spirit, as he does when alone, although many think differently when they are in the body, as happens when they are not alone. Then it is different because they raise their understanding above the proprium of their will, or the love of their spirit. These things have been declared to make known that will and understanding are distinct faculties, and created to act as one, and that they ought to do so before death and if not they are forced to do so after death. </p>

<p>
397. Now that man may not by the understanding be in heaven while by the will he is in hell, as is possible, and may thereby have a divided mind, after death everything of the understanding which transcends its own love is removed; whereby it comes that in everyone the will and understanding finally make one. With those in heaven the will loves good and the understanding thinks truth; but with those in hell the will loves evil and the understanding thinks falsity. The same is true of man in this world when he is thinking from his spirit, as he does when alone; yet many, so long as they are in the body, when they are not alone think otherwise. They then think otherwise because they raise their understanding above the proper love of their will, that is, of their spirit. These things have been said, to make known that the will and understanding are two distinct things, although created to act as one, and that they are made to act as one after death, if not before. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #397 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
397. Nunc ne homo per intellectum sit in coelo, sicut potest, et per voluntatem in inferno, et ne sic mentem divisam habeat, ideo post mortem omne intellectus, quod supra amorem proprium ejus est, removetur; unde fit, quod voluntas et intellectus apud omnes tandem unum agant; apud illos qui in coelo sunt[,] voluntas amat bonum, et intellectus <sup>1</sup>
cogitat verum[;] apud illos autem qui in inferno sunt, voluntas amat malum et intellectus cogitat falsum. Similiter facit homo in Mundo, quando ex suo spiritu cogitat, quod fit cum solus est, tametsi multi aliter cum in corpore sunt, quod fit cum non soli sunt; quod tunc aliter, est quia intellectum suum elevant supra proprium voluntatis suae seu spiritus sui amorem. Haec dicta sunt, ut sciatur quod Voluntas et Intellectus duo distincta sint, et quod tamen creata sint ut unum agant, et quod ad unum agendum, si non prius, usque post mortem adigantur. <p>
