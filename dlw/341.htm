341, 4. The inflow from hell activates things that are evil functions, in places where there are things that answer to them. The things that answer to evil functions (that is, harmful plants and animals) are characteristic of corpses, decay, feces and manure, spoilage, and urine. As a result, the plants and little creatures like these, the ones just listed, turn up in places where these substances are found. There are more such species in the tropics, where we find snakes, basilisks, crocodiles, scorpions, mice, and the like.<p>Everyone knows that swamps, marshes, manure piles, and rotten soils teem with creatures like these and that vicious insects fill the air like clouds, and vicious bugs infest the earth like armies and devour plants down to their very roots. I noticed once in my own garden that in the space of a cubit almost all the dust turned into tiny winged creatures, because when I stirred it with my stick they rose up in clouds.<p>We can see simply from experience that carrion and decay are congenial and close kin to these vicious and useless little creatures. It is particularly clear when we consider the reason, namely that there are foul stenches like these in the hells, where such little creatures are also found. That is why hells are named after their odors, some called morgues, some manure piles, some urinals, and so on. They are all covered, though, so that their exhaust fumes do not escape, for when they are opened a little (which happens when newly arriving demons are let in), it induces vomiting and headaches; while the ones that are also toxic cause a loss of consciousness. The dust itself in hell is like this, so it is known there as "the dust of doom."<p>We can see from this that these vicious creatures are found where foul substances like this occur because they suit each other. </p>

<p>341. (4) Influx from hell produces those forms which are evil forms of use in places where there are corresponding elements. The elements that correspond to evil forms of use, that is, to malignant herbage and harmful animals, are those of carrion, putrefaction, excrement and dung, rot, and urine. In places where these elements exist, therefore, such herbage and vermin spring up, and in tropical zones larger creatures of a like character, such as snakes, basilisks, <sup>1</sup>
crocodiles, scorpions, mice and rats, and others.<p>Everyone knows that marshes, swamps, dunghills, and rotting compost heaps are filled with such creatures; also that noxious winged insects fill the atmosphere like clouds, and noxious vermin the earth like armies on the march, consuming its herbage even to the roots.<p> </p>
<p>[2] In my garden I once observed that almost all the dust in a three or four foot area turned into tiny winged insects, for when I stirred it with my stick, they rose up like mists.<p>It is apparent simply from experience that carrion and putrefaction accord with such noxious and useless vermin, and that they are of a like character. This can clearly be seen from the cause, which is that the same foul odors and stenches exist in hells where such vermin also are found. These hells are consequently named accordingly, some being called carrion hells, some dung hells, some urine hells, and so on. They are, however, all covered over, to keep these exhalations from being emitted from them. For when they are opened just a little, which happens when newly arrived devils are entering, these hells induce vomiting and inflict headaches, and those which are at the same time poisonous cause fainting. The very dust there is also of the same character, on which account it is called there accursed dust.<p>It is apparent from this that wherever such foul odors exist, such noxious creatures are found, because they correspond.<p>

<p>341. (iv) Influx from hell brings about evil uses wherever there are such things as correspond to them. The things that correspond to evil uses, that is, to hurtful plants and noxious animals, are cadaverous, putrid, excrementitious, stercoraceous, rancid and urinous matters. Consequently in places where these are, such plants and such small animals as were mentioned above, spring forth; and in the torrid zone, similar things of larger size, such as serpents, basilisks, crocodiles, scorpions, rats and others. Everyone knows that swamps, stagnant pools, dung-hills, fetid bogs are full of such things, also that noxious insects fill the atmosphere like clouds, and noxious vermin walk the earth in armies, consuming its plants to the very roots. I once observed in my garden in the space of an ell, nearly all the dust was turned into minute insects for when it was stirred with a stick, they rose like clouds. It is evident from mere observation that cadaverous and putrid matters are in accord with these noxious and useless little animals and that they are homogeneous, and it is still more clearly seen from the cause which is that similar stenches and fumes exist in the hells where such animalcules are also to be seen. Those hells are therefore named accordingly. Some are called cadaverous, some stercoraceous, some urinous, and so on. But all these hells are covered over, that those vapours may not escape from them. For when they are opened a very little as happens when novitiate devils enter, they excite vomiting and oppressive headaches, and those that are also poisonous induce fainting. Even the dust there is of the same nature, wherefore it is called damned dust. From this it is clear that there are such noxious stenches because the two things correspond. </p>

341. (4) Those things that are evil uses are effected by the operation of influx from hell, wherever there are such things as correspond thereto. The things that correspond to evil uses, that is, to hurtful plants and noxious animals, are cadaverous, putrid, excrementitious, stercoraceous, rancid, and urinous matters; consequently, in places where these are, such herbs and such animalcules spring forth as are mentioned above; and in the torrid zone, like things of larger size, as serpents, basilisks, crocodiles, scorpions, rats, and so forth. Every one knows that swamps, stagnant ponds, dung, fetid bogs, are full of such things; also that noxious insects fill the atmosphere in clouds, and noxious vermin walk the earth in armies, and consume its herbs to the very roots. I once observed in my garden, that in the space of a half yard, nearly all the dust was turned into minute insects, for when it was stirred with a stick, they rose in clouds. That cadaverous and putrid matters are in accord with these noxious and useless little things, and that the two are homogeneous, is evident from mere observation; and it is still more clearly seen from the cause, which is, that like stenches and fumes exist in the hells, where such little things are likewise to be seen. Those hells are therefore named accordingly; some are called cadaverous, some stercoraceous, some urinous, and so on. But all these hells are covered over, that those vapors may not escape from them. For when they are opened a very little, which happens when novitiate devils enter, they excite vomiting and cause headache, and such as are also poisonous induce fainting. The very dust there is also of the same nature, wherefore it is there called damned dust. From this it is evident that there are such noxious insects wherever there are such stenches, because the two correspond. </p>

<p>341. IV. Quod influxus ex inferno operetur illa quae usus mali sunt, in locis ubi sunt illa quae correspondent. Illa quae malis usibus, hoc est, herbis malignis et animalibus noxiis, correspondent, sunt cadaverosa, putria, excrementitia et stercorea, rancida, urinosa; quare in locis ubi haec sunt, tales herbae, et talia animalcula, quae supra memorata sunt, existunt; et in zonis torridis similia majora, sicut serpentes, basilisci, crocodili, scorpii, mures, et alia. Unusquisque novit, quod paludes, stagna, stercora, humi putidae, talibus referta sint: tum quod noxia volatilia sicut nubes Athmosphaeram impleant, et quod noxii vermes sicut agmina terram, et consumant herbas usque ad radices.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Semel in meo horto animadverti, quod in spatio ulnae paene omnis pulvis in minima volatilia versus sit, nam baculo agitatus, sicut nimbi se sustulerunt. Quod cadaverosa ac putida cum noxiis et inutilibus illis animalculis concordent, et quod homogenea sint, a sola experientia patet; quod manifeste ex causa videri potest, quae est quod similes putores et nidores sint in Infernis, ubi talia animalcula etiam apparent; quare Inferna illa inde nominantur, et quaedam vocantur cadaverosa, quaedam stercorea, quaedam urinosa, et sic porro; sed sunt illa omnia tecta, ne halitus illi inde exspirent; nam dum aliquantulum aperiuntur, quod fit quando novitii diaboli intrant, vomitus ciunt, gravedines capiti inferunt, et illa quae simul venenata sunt, deliquia inducunt; ipse pulvis ibi etiam talis est, quare ille ibi vocatur pulvis damnatus: inde patet, quod ubi tales putores sunt, talia noxia sint, quia correspondent. </p>
