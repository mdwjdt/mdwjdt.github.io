333. Useful functions for our acceptance of what is spiritual from the Lord are all the elements of our religion and its worship, everything, then, that teaches us to recognize and understand God and to recognize and understand what is good and what is true--that therefore teaches us eternal life. These, like academic disciplines, we get from parents, teachers, sermons, and books, and especially by devoting ourselves to living by them. In the Christian world, this comes through teaching and preaching from the Word, and through the Word, from the Lord.<p>We can describe the range of these functions much as we describe physical functions--in terms of nourishment, for example, clothing, shelter, recreation and pleasure, and protection of our state, as long as we apply them to the soul. We may compare nourishment to the good that love does, clothing to the truth that wisdom provides, dwelling to heaven, recreation and pleasure to life's happiness and heavenly joy, protection to [safety from] the attacks of evil, and preservation of our state to eternal life.<p>The Lord grants all these gifts upon our acknowledgment that everything physical also comes from the Lord and that we are simply like servants or stewards given responsibility for the Lord's goods. </p>

333. Forms of use for receiving a spiritual character from the Lord are all matters having to do with religion and so with worship, thus which teach an acknowledgment and knowledge of God, and a knowledge and acknowledgment of goodness and truth, and consequently eternal life. These are similarly learned like other disciplines from parents, teachers, sermons and books, and especially through efforts to pursue a life in accordance with them. In the Christian world they are learned through doctrines and sermons drawn from the Word, and through the Word from the Lord.<p>These forms of use can be described in their range and scope in the same terms as forms of use to the body, as for example, in terms of nourishment, clothing, lodging, recreation and enjoyment, protection, and the preservation of condition, provided one applies them to the soul - its nourishment to goods of love, its clothing to truths of wisdom, its lodging to heaven, its recreation and enjoyment to felicity of life and heavenly joy, its protection to evils assailing, and the preservation of its condition to eternal life.<p>All of these boons are bestowed by the Lord according to a person's acknowledgment that the same boons which are matters of the body are also all from the Lord, and that a person is only as a servant or steward set over the goods of his Lord. <sup>1</sup>

333. Uses for receiving the spiritual from the Lord are all the things which belong to religion and to worship therefrom, thus all things that teach the acknowledgment and knowledge of God, and the knowledge and acknowledgment of good and truth and thus eternal life. These are acquired as other learning from parents, teachers, publications and books, and especially by applying what is learned to life, and in the Christian world, by doctrines and sermons from the Word, and through the Word from the Lord. These uses in their whole extent may be described in the same terms as the uses of the body, as nourishment, clothing, habitation, recreation, enjoyment, and protection of state, if only these are applied to the soul, nutrition answering to goods of love, clothing to truths of wisdom, habitation to heaven, recreation and enjoyment to happiness of life and heavenly joy, protection to safety from infesting evils, and preservation of state to eternal life. All these things are given by the Lord according to the acknowledgment that all bodily things are also from the Lord, and that man is only a servant and domestic administrator appointed over the goods of his Lord. </p>

333. Uses for receiving the spiritual from the Lord, are all things that belong to religion and to worship therefrom; thus all things that teach the acknowledgment and knowledge of God and the knowledge and acknowledgment of good and truth and thus eternal life, which are acquired in the same way as other learning, from parents, teachers, discourses, and books, and especially by applying to life what is so learned; and in the Christian world, by doctrines and discourses from the Word, and through the Word from the Lord. These uses in their full extent may be described under the same heads as the uses of the body, as nourishment, clothing, habitation, recreation and enjoyment, and preservation of state, if only they are applied to the soul; as nutrition to goods of love, clothing to truths of wisdom, habitation to heaven, recreation and enjoyment to felicity of life and heavenly joy, protection to safety from infesting evils, and preservation of state to eternal life. All these things are given by the Lord according to the acknowledgment that all bodily things are also from the Lord, and that a man is only as a servant and house-steward appointed over the goods of his Lord. </p>

333. Usus ad recipiendum Spirituale a Domino, sunt omnia quae Religionis et inde Cultus sunt, ita quae docent agnitionem et cognitionem Dei, et cognitionem et agnitionem boni et veri, et sic vitam aeternam; quae similiter ut disciplinae [ex] parentibus, magistris, praedicationibus et libris <sup>1</sup>
hauriuntur, et imprimis per studia vitae secundum illas; in Christiano Orbe per Doctrinas et praedicationes ex Verbo, et per Verbum ex Domino. Possunt hi usus in sua extensione per similia, per quae usus corporis describi; ut per nutritionem, induitionem, habitationem, recreationem et delectationem, tutationem [et conservationem] status, modo fiat applicatio ad animam, nutritio ad bona amoris, induitio ad vera sapientiae, habitatio ad coelum, recreatio et delectatio ad felicitatem vitae et ad gaudium coeleste, tutatio ad mala infestantia, et conservatio status ad vitam aeternam. Haec omnia a Domino dantur secundum agnitionem quod omnia illa quae corporis sunt, etiam a Domino sint, et quod homo sit modo sicut famulus et minister oeconomus <sup>2</sup>
super bona Domini sui constitutus. <p>
