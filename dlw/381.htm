<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第381节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>381、天堂分为两个国度，一个被称为属天的，另一个被称为属灵的。在属天国度，对主的爱掌权；在属灵国度，由这爱所产生的智慧掌权。爱掌权的属天国度被称为天国的心，智慧掌权的属灵国度被称为天国的肺。必须知道的是，整个天使天堂整体上类似一个人，并且在主眼里就显为一个人。因此，这个人的心形成一个国度，肺形成另一个国度。整个天堂有一个总体的心肺运动，每位天使由此都有一个具体的心肺运动。总体的心肺运动唯独来自主，因为爱和智慧唯独来自祂。事实上，心肺运动就存在于主所在并起源于主的灵界太阳中，并由此存在于天使天堂和宇宙中。摆脱空间观念，思想全在，你就会确信，事实的确如此。天堂分为两个国度，即属天国度和属灵国度，这一点可见于《天堂与地狱》一书(20-28节)；整个天使天堂整体上类似一个人(59-67节)。</p>

381. The heavens are divided into two realms, one called "heavenly" and the other called "spiritual." In the heavenly realm, love for the Lord reigns supreme, while in the spiritual realm, wisdom from that love reigns. The realm where love reigns is called the heart region of heaven, and the realm where wisdom reigns is called the lung region of heaven.<p>We need to realize that the whole angelic heaven, all in all, reflects a single person and looks like a single person to the Lord. Consequently, the heart forms one realm and the lungs another. There is actually a general cardiac and pulmonary motion throughout heaven, and a secondary one in every individual angel. The general cardiac and pulmonary motion is from the Lord alone, because he is the sole source of love and wisdom. These two motions occur in the sun where the Lord is, the sun that comes from the Lord, and from there flows into the angelic heaven and into the universe. Cancel out the notion of space and think about omnipresence and you will be assured that this is true.<p>On the division of heaven into two realms, one heavenly and one spiritual, see <a href="../hh/26.htm" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 26-28</a> [<a href="../hh/20.htm" target=_top>20-28</a>]; and on the whole angelic heaven, taken as a unit, reflecting a single individual, see <a href="../hh/59.htm" target=_top>59-87</a> [<a href="../hh/59.htm" target=_top>59-86</a>] of the same work. </p>

381. The heavens are divided into two kingdoms, one of which we call celestial, the other spiritual. In the celestial kingdom love toward the Lord reigns, and in the spiritual kingdom wisdom arising from that love reigns. The first kingdom, where love reigns, is called heaven's kingdom of the heart; and the second kingdom, where wisdom reigns, is called heaven's kingdom of the lungs.<p>It must be known that the whole angelic heaven in its entirety resembles a single person, and in the Lord's sight appears as a single person. Consequently the heart of that person forms one kingdom, and the lungs of that person form another. For present throughout the whole of heaven are general cardiac and pulmonary motions, and on that account particular ones in every angel; and the general cardiac and pulmonary motions come from the Lord alone, because from Him alone come love and wisdom. Indeed, these two motions are present in the sun where the Lord is and which originates from the Lord, and from that are present in the angelic heaven and in the universe. To judge the reality of this, rid yourself of notions of space and think of omnipresence, and you will be convinced.<p>The fact that the heavens are divided into two kingdom, celestial and spiritual, may be seen in the book Heaven and Hell, nos. <a href="../hh/20.htm">20-28</a>; and that the whole angelic heaven in its entirety resembles a single person in nos. <a href="../hh/59.htm">59-67</a> there. </p>

381. The heavens are distinguished into two kingdoms, one of which is called celestial and the other spiritual; in the celestial kingdom love to the Lord reigns, and in the spiritual kingdom wisdom from that love. That kingdom in which love prevails is called heaven's cardiac kingdom, and that where wisdom reigns, is called its pulmonary kingdom. It should be known that the whole angelic heaven in its entirety resembles one man and so appears in the Lord's sight. Consequently its heart makes one kingdom, and its lungs the other; for there is a general cardiac and pulmonary motion of the whole heaven, and an individual motion therefrom in each angel. The general cardiac and pulmonary motion is from the Lord alone, because love and wisdom come from Him alone; for these two motions are in the Sun, where the Lord is, and which exists from the Lord, and thence in the angelic heaven and in the universe. Banish [the idea of] spaces and think of omnipresence, and you will be convinced that it is so. That the heavens are distinguished into two kingdoms, celestial and spiritual, may be seen in the work on HEAVEN AND HELL (<a href="../hh/26.htm">26-28</a>); and that the whole angelic heaven in its entirety resembles one man (<a href="../hh/59.htm">59-67</a>). </p>

381. The heavens are divided into two kingdoms, one called celestial, the other spiritual; in the celestial kingdom love to the Lord reigns, and in the spiritual kingdom wisdom from that love. The kingdom where love reigns is called heaven's cardiac kingdom, the one where wisdom reigns is called its pulmonic kingdom. Be it known, that the whole angelic heaven in its aggregate represents a single man, and before the Lord appears as a single man; consequently its heart makes one kingdom and its lungs another. For there is a general cardiac and pulmonic movement throughout heaven, and a particular movement therefrom in each angel. The general cardiac and pulmonic movement is from the Lord alone, because love and wisdom are from Him alone. For these two movements are in the sun where the Lord is and which is from the Lord, and from that in the angelic heavens and in the universe. Banish spaces and think of omnipresence, and you will be convinced that it is so. That the heavens are divided into two kingdoms, celestial and spiritual, see the work on Heaven and Hell (n. <a href="../hh/20.htm" target=_top>20-28</a>); and that the whole angelic heaven in the aggregate represents a single man (n. <a href="../hh/59.htm" target=_top>59-67</a>). </p>

381. Sunt Coeli in duo Regna distincti, quorum unum vocatur Coeleste, alterum Spirituale; in Regno Coelesti regnat amor in Dominum, et in Regno Spirituali regnat sapientia ex illo amore; illud Regnum, ubi regnat amor, vocatur Cardiacum Coeli, et illud Regnum, ubi regnat sapientia, vocatur Pulmonicum Coeli. Sciendum est, quod universum Coelum angelicum in suo complexu referat unum Hominem, et coram Domino appareat sicut unus homo; quare Cor ejus facit unum Regnum, et Pulmo ejus facit <sup>1</sup>
alterum: est enim Motus cardiacus et Pulmonicus in communi in toto Coelo, et inde in particulari in quovis angelo; et communis motus cardiacus et pulmonicus est a Solo Domino, quia ab Ipso Solo est amor et sapientia: in Sole enim ubi est Dominus et qui est a Domino, sunt duo illi motus, et inde in Coelo angelico et in universo: quod ita sit, abstrahe spatia, et cogita Omnipraesentiam, et confirmaberis.
