<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第59节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>59、由此可见，神性在受造宇宙的一切事物中；因此，受造宇宙被称为“耶和华手的工”，如圣言中所说的，就是神性之爱与神性智慧的工，因为耶和华的手就表示这些。不过，神性虽在受造宇宙的一切事物中，但它们的存在里面却毫无神性本身之物；因为受造宇宙不是神，而是来自神；它因来自神，故有神的形像在里面，就像人在镜中的形像；事实上，人虽在镜中显现，但镜中却毫无人的东西。</p>

59. We can conclude from this that Divinity is present in absolutely everything in the created universe and that the created universe is therefore the work of Jehovah's hands, as it says in the Word. That is, it is a work of divine love and wisdom, for this is what is meant by "Jehovah's hands." Further, even though Divinity is present in all things great and small in the created universe, there is no trace of intrinsic divinity in their own being. While the created universe is not God, it is from God; and since it is from God, his image is in it like the image of a person in a mirror. We do indeed see a person there, but there is still nothing of the person in the mirror. </p>

59. It can be seen from this that the Divine is present in each and every constituent of the created universe, and consequently that the created universe is the work of the hands of Jehovah, as we are told in the Word, <sup>1</sup>
meaning that it is the work of Divine love and Divine wisdom, for these are what are meant by the hands of Jehovah.<p>Moreover, even though the Divine is present in each and every constituent of the created universe, still there is nothing of the Divine in their being. For the created universe is not God, but from God. And because it is from God, it has in it His image, like the image of a person in a mirror, in which the person indeed appears, but which nevertheless has nothing of the person in it.<p>

59. From these premises it can be established that the Divine is in each and every thing of the created universe, and consequently that the created universe is the work of Jehovah's hands, as is said in the Word, that is, the work of Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, for these are understood by "Jehovah's hands." Yet although the Divine is in each and every thing of the created universe, still there is in their esse nothing of the Divine in itself. For the created universe is not God but is from God; and because it is from God, there is in it an image of Him like the image of a man in a mirror, wherein indeed the man appears, while yet there is nothing of the man in it. </p>

59. From the above it can be seen that the Divine is in each and every thing of the created universe, and consequently that the created universe is the work of the hands of Jehovah, as is said in the Word; that is, the work of Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, for these are meant by the hands of Jehovah. But though the Divine is in each and all things of the created universe there is in their esse nothing of the Divine in itself; for the created universe is not God, but is from God; and since it is from God, there is in it an image of Him like the image of a man in a mirror, wherein indeed the man appears, but still there is nothing of the man in it. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #59 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
59. Ex his constare potest, quod Divinum sit in omnibus et singulis Universi creati, et inde quod Universum creatum sit Opus manuum Jehovae, ut dicitur in Verbo, hoc est, Opus Divini Amoris et Divinae Sapientiae, nam haec intelliguntur per manus Jehovae: et tametsi Divinum est in omnibus et singulis Universi Creati, usque est nihil Divini in se in illorum esse, Universum enim creatum non est Deus, sed a Deo; et quia est a Deo, est in illo imago Ipsius, sicut imago hominis in speculo, in quo quidem homo apparet, sed usque in illa nihil hominis est. </p>
