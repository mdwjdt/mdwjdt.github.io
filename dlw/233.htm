<h4 align="center"></h4><p>233、我从天堂被告知，在永恒之主，即耶和华在世上取得一个人身之前，两个在先层级就实际存在于祂里面，而第三个层级则潜在于祂里面，天使的情况也是如此；但是，主在世取得一个人身之后，就另外披上了第三个层级，就是我们所说的属世层，由此变成人，和世人一样；然而，不同之处在于，主里面的这最后一个层级，和在先层级一样，也是无限和非受造的；而在天使和世人里面，它们都是有限和受造的。<br><br>事实上，先前充满宇宙一切空间，却与空间无关(69-72节)的神性的确进入，甚至渗透到自然界的最表层。然而，在取得人身之前，神性间接通过天堂流入属世层级，而在取得人身之后，则直接从祂自己流入。正因如此，在主降临之前，世上的一切教会都是属灵和属天事物的代表；但在祂降临之后，则变成属灵-属世和属天-属世，并且代表性敬拜被废除了。也正因如此，天使天堂的太阳，即神性之爱和神性智慧的首先发出，如前所述，在主取得人身之后比在祂取得人身之前放射出更辉煌、更灿烂的光芒。这也是以赛亚书中这些话的意思：<br><br>在那日，月光必像日光，日光必加七倍，像七日的光一样。(以赛亚书30:26)<br><br>这是指着主降世后天堂和教会的状态说的。启示录：<br><br>人子的脸面像日头满有力地发光。(启示录1:16)<br><br>以及其它地方(如以赛亚书60:20；撒母耳记下23:3,4；马太福音17:1,2)。主降世前通过天堂对世人的间接启示好比月光，月光就是间接的阳光。主降世后，这光成了直接启示，故以赛亚书上说，月光必像日光(30:26)。诗篇：<br><br>在祂的日子，义人要发旺，大有平安，直到月亮不再重现。(诗篇72：7)<br><br>这话也是指着主说的。</p>

233. I have received information from heaven that before the Lord from eternity (who is Jehovah) took on a human nature in the world, the first two levels in him were actual while the third level was potential, which is the way things are for angels. After he took on a human nature in our world, though, he clothed himself with that third level as well, the one we call "earthly," and in this way became a human being like us in this world. Still, there was the difference that this level like the others was infinite and uncreated, while in angels and in us the levels are finite and created.<p>What happened was that although the Divinity that had filled all space without being bound by space (see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_30_25.htm" target=_top>Isaiah 30:25</a> [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_30_26.htm" target=_top>26</a>]). This is about the state of heaven and the church after the Lord's coming into the world. There is also <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_16.htm" target=_top>Revelation 1:16</a>, "the face of the Human-born One looked like the sun shining at full strength;" and such other passages as <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_20.htm" target=_top>Isaiah 60:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_23_3.htm" target=_top>2 Samuel 23:3-4</a>; and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_1.htm" target=_top>Matthew 17:1-2</a>. We might compare our indirect enlightenment through the angelic heaven, which obtained before the Lord's coming, with the moon's light, which is indirect sunlight. Since this became a direct enlightenment after the Lord's coming, it says in [the passage just cited from] Isaiah that the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun; and it says in David, "Righteous people will blossom in his day, and peace in abundance until the moon is no more" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_72_7.htm" target=_top>Psalms 72:7</a>). This too is about the Lord. </p>

<p>233. I have been told from heaven that in the Lord from eternity, who is Jehovah, before He assumed a humanity in the world, the first two degrees existed actually, and the third degree potentially, as they do also in the case of angels, but that after assuming a humanity in the world, He put on in addition the third degree as well, which we call natural, so that He became in consequence a man like any other in the world, yet with the difference that this last degree, like the previous one, is infinite and uncreated, while the same degrees in an angel or person are finite and created.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Indeed, the Divine which previously filled every space and interval of space in the universe independently of space (nos. <a href="69.htm">69-72</a>) did enter into and permeate even the lasts of nature. Before His assuming a human form, however, the Divine influx into the natural degree was conveyed indirectly through the angelic heavens, whereas after His assuming a human form it flowed directly from Him.<p>It is owing to this that all the churches in the world prior to His advent were representative of spiritual and celestial qualities, whereas after His advent they became spiritually and celestially natural, and representational worship was abolished.<p>It was owing to this also that the sun of the angelic heaven - which is, as we have already said, the first emanation of His Divine love and wisdom - shone with a greater radiance and splendor after He assumed human form than it did before He assumed it.<p> </p>
<p>[3] This, too, is meant by these words in Isaiah:<p>(In that day) the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, as the light of seven days... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_30_26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>)<p>This statement is made in reference to the state of heaven and the church after the Lord's advent into the world.<p>Again, in the book of Revelation:<p>The countenance (of the Son of Man was seen) as the sun shines in its strength. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>)<p>Also elsewhere, as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_20.htm">Isaiah 60:20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_23_3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3-4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17:1-2</a>.<p>The enlightenment of people indirectly through the angelic heaven, as was the case before the Lord's advent, may be likened to the light of the moon, which is the sun's light conveyed indirectly. And because this light after His advent became one conveyed directly, it is said in Isaiah that "the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun." So also in the book of Psalms:<p>In His day the righteous man shall flourish, and abundant peace, until the moon is no more. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_72_7.htm">Psalm 72:7</a>)<p>This, too, is said in reference to the Lord. </p>

<p>233. It has been told me from heaven that in the Lord from eternity, Who is Jehovah, before the assumption of the Human in the world, the two prior degrees existed actually, and the third degree in potency, as they do also with angels. But that after the assumption of a Human in the world, He put on also the third degree, which is called the natural, thereby becoming Man, like a man in the world, the only difference being that in the Lord, this degree as were the prior ones, is infinite and uncreate, while in angel and in man these degrees are finite and created. For the Divine which, apart from space, had filled all space (<a href="69.htm">69-72</a>), penetrated even to the ultimates of nature. But before the assumption of the Human, there was a Divine influx into the natural degree mediate through the angelic heavens, but after the assumption, immediate from Himself. This is the reason that all Churches in the world before His advent were representative of spiritual and celestial things, but after His advent they became spiritual-natural and celestial-natural, and representative worship was abolished. This was also the reason that the Sun of the angelic heaven which, as was said above, is the first proceeding of His Divine Love and Wisdom, after the assumption of the Human, shone forth with greater radiance and splendour than before the assumption. This also is what is understood by these words in Isaiah: <p>In that day the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_30_26.htm">Isa. 30:26</a> <p>This is said of the state of heaven and of the Church after the Lord's coming into the world. Again, in the Apocalypse: <p>The countenance of the Son of Man was as the sun shineth in his strength. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_16.htm">Rev. 1:16</a> <p>And elsewhere as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_60_20.htm">Isa. 60:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_23_3.htm">2 Sam. 23:3-4</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matt. 17:1-2</a>. <p>The mediate enlightenment of men through the angelic heaven, which was before the coming of the Lord, may be compared to the light of the moon, which is the mediate light of the sun. And because after His coming this was made immediate, it is said in Isaiah that the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun; and in David: <p>In His day shall the righteous flourish, and abundance of peace until there is no longer any moon. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_77_7.htm">Psalm 77:7</a> <p>This also is said of the Lord. </p>

233. It has been told me from heaven, that in the Lord from eternity, who is Jehovah, before His assumption of a Human in the world, the two prior degrees existed actually, and the third degree potentially, as they do also with angels; but that after the assumption of a Human in the world, He put on over these the third degree, called the natural, thereby becoming Man, like a man in the world; but with the difference, that in the Lord this degree, like the prior degrees, is infinite and uncreate, while in angel and in man they are all finite and created. For the Divine which, apart from space, had filled all spaces (n. <a href="69.htm" target=_top>69-72</a>), penetrated even to the outmosts of nature; yet before the assumption of the Human, the Divine influx into the natural degree was mediate through the angelic heavens, but after the assumption it was immediate from Himself. This is the reason why all churches in the world before His Advent were representative of spiritual and celestial things, but after His Advent became spiritual-natural and celestial-natural, and representative worship was abolished. This also was the reason why the sun of the angelic heaven, which, as was said above, is the first proceeding of His Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, after the assumption of the Human shone out with greater effulgence and splendor than before the assumption. And this is what is meant by these words in Isaiah: <p>In that day the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_30_26.htm" target=_top>30:26</a>). <p>This is said of the state of heaven and of the church after the Lord's coming into the world.

<p>233. Ex Coelo dictum est mihi, quod in Domino ab aeterno, qui est Jehovah, ante assumtionem Humani in Mundo, fuerint bini Gradus priores actualiter, et tertius Gradus in potentia, quales etiam sunt apud Angelos, sed quod post assumtionem Humani in Mundo, etiam tertium Gradum, qui Naturalis vocatur, superinduerit, et quod per id factus sit Homo similis homini in Mundo, cum discrimine tamen, quod hic Gradus, sicut priores, Infinitus et Increatus sit, at quod illi Gradus in Angelo et in homine finiti et creati sint.<p> </p>
