<h4 align="center"></h4><p>154、主通过灵界的太阳创造宇宙及其万物，因为这太阳是神性之爱与神性智慧的最先发出，一切事物皆起源于神性之爱与神性智慧，如前面所指出的(52－82节)。一切受造物里面，无论最大的还是最小的，都存在三要素，即目的，原因和结果。没有这三要素在里面的受造物是不可能存在的。在宏大的体系，也就是整个宇宙中，这三要素按以下秩序存在：一切事物的目的在太阳，也就是神性之爱与神性智慧的最先发出中；一切事物的原因在灵界；一切事物的结果在自然界。不过，下文将说明，这三要素如何存在于首先之物和末后之物中。由于没有这三要素在里面的受造物是不可能存在的，故可知，主通过太阳创造宇宙及其万物，这太阳拥有万物的目的在里面。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #154 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
154. The reason the Lord created the universe and everything in it by means of the spiritual world's sun is that this sun is the first emanation of divine love and wisdom, and as explained above (<a href="52.htm" target=_top>52-82</a>), everything comes from divine love and wisdom.<p>There are three components of everything that has been created, no matter how large or how small it is: a purpose, a means, and a result. There is nothing created that lacks these three components. In the largest instance, the universe, these three components arise in the following pattern: the purpose of everything is in that sun that is the first emanation of divine love and wisdom; the means of everything is in the spiritual world; and the result of everything is in the physical world. I will describe below [<a href="167.htm" target=_top>167-172</a>] how these three components occur in both first and last forms.<p>Since there is nothing created that lacks these three components, it follows that the universe and everything in it has been created by the Lord by means of the sun where the purpose of everything resides. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #154 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
154. The Lord created the universe and everything in it by means of the sun in the spiritual world because that sun is the first emanation of His Divine love and wisdom, and everything originates from Divine love and wisdom, as we demonstrated above in nos. <a href="52.htm">52-82</a>.<p>We find in everything created, in the grandest and in the most infinitesimal, three elements - end, cause and effect. There is nothing created that does not have in it these three elements.<p>In the grand scheme or in the universe these three occur in sequence as follows. In the sun which is the first emanation of Divine love and wisdom is found the end or purpose in all things. In the spiritual world are found the causes of all things. And in the natural world are found the effects of all things. But how these three exist in the firsts of creation and in the lasts of it will be told in subsequent discussions.<p>Now because there is nothing created that does not have in it these three elements, it follows that the Lord created the universe and everything in it by the sun which has in it the end or purpose in all things. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #154 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
154. The universe and everything therein[was] created by the Lord by means of the Sun of the spiritual world because that Sun is the first proceeding of the Divine Love and Wisdom. And from the Divine Love and Wisdom all things are, as was shown above,<a href="52.htm">52-82</a>. In every created thing, as in the greatest so in the least, there are three things-end, cause and effect. A created thing in which there are not these three is not possible. In what is the greatest, that is, in the universe, these three exist in the following order. In the Sun which is the first proceeding of the Divine Love and Wisdom, is the end of all things. In the spiritual world are the causes of all things. And in the natural world are the effects of all things. But how these three are in first and last things will be told in what follows. Now because no created thing is possible in which there are not these three, it follows that the universe and all things therein were created by the Lord through the Sun where is the end of all things. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #154 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
154. The universe and all things thereof were created by the Lord, the sun of the spiritual world serving as a medium, because that sun is the first proceeding of Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, and from Divine Love and Divine Wisdom all things are (as was pointed out above, n. <a href="52.htm" target=_top>52-82</a>). In every thing created, greatest as well as least, there are these three, end, cause and effect. A created thing in which these three are not, is impossible. In what is greatest, that is, in the universe, these three exist in the following order; in the sun, which is the first proceeding of Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, is the end of all things; in the spiritual world are the causes of all things; in the natural world are the effects of all things. How these three are in things first and in things last shall be shown in what follows. Since, then, no created thing is possible in which these three are not, it follows that the universe and all things of it were created by the Lord through the sun, wherein is the end of all things. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #154 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
154. Quod Universum et omnia ejus medio Sole Mundi spiritualis a Domino creata sint, est quia ille Sol est primum procedens Divini Amoris et Divinae Sapientiae, et ex Divino Amore et ex Divina Sapientia sunt omnia, ut supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_154/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_52" target=_top>52-82</a> demonstratum est. Sunt tria quae in omni creato, tam maximo quam <sup>1</sup>
minimo, sunt, Finis, Causa et Effectus; creatum, in quo illa tria non sunt, non datur: haec Tria in Maximo seu in Universo in hoc ordine existunt; in Sole, qui est Primum procedens Divini Amoris et Divinae Sapientiae, est Finis omnium; in Mundo spirituali sunt Causae omnium; et in Mundo naturali sunt Effectus omnium: quomodo autem haec tria in Primis et in Ultimis sunt, in sequentibus dicetur. Nunc quia non datur creatum, in quo illa tria non sunt, sequitur quod Universum et omnia ejus, a Domino per Solem, ubi est finis omnium, creata sint. <p>
