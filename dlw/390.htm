390, 7. The union of the human spirit and body is accomplished through the correspondence of volition and discernment with the heart and the lungs, and disunion is caused by a lack of correspondence. It has not yet been realized that our mind, meaning our volition and discernment, is our spirit, and that the spirit is a person. It has also not yet been realized that our spirit has a pulse and breathing just as the body does. As a result, there has been no way to know that the pulse and breathing of the spirit within us flows into the pulse and breathing of our body and causes them.<p>If our spirit enjoys a pulse and breathing just as our body does, it follows that there is the same kind of correspondence between the pulse and breathing of our spirit and the pulse and breathing of our body. The mind, as already noted [<a href="386.htm" target=_top>386-389</a>], is our spirit; so when the correspondence between these two activities ceases, there is a separation--death.<p>Separation or death occurs when the body either by disease or by trauma reaches a state when it can no longer act in concert with its spirit. In this way, the correspondence ceases; and when the correspondence ceases, so does the union. This is not when the breathing alone stops, but when the heartbeat stops, since as long as the heart is working, love is still there with its vital warmth, maintaining life. We can see this in cases of fainting or suffocation as well as in the state of the fetus in the womb.<p>In brief, our physical life depends on the fact that our physical pulse and breathing are responsive to the pulse and breathing of our spirit; and when this responsiveness ceases, physical life ceases and the spirit departs, to continue its life in the spiritual world. This life is so much like our life in the physical world that we do not realize we have died.<p>Most people are in the spiritual world within two days after leaving their bodies. I have talked with some individuals after two days. </p>

<p>390. (7) The conjunction of a person's spirit with the body is due to the correspondence of his will and intellect with his heart and lungs, and their disjunction to the absence of that correspondence. Since it has not been known before that a person's mind - by which is meant the will and intellect - is his spirit, and that the spirit is the person, and since it has not been known that a person's spirit has a pulse and respiration just as the body does, it could not be known that the pulse and respiration of the spirit in a person flow into the pulse and respiration of his body and produce them.<p>Since a person's spirit possesses a pulse and respiration just as the body does, it follows therefore that there is a like correspondence of the pulse and respiration of a person's spirit with the pulse and respiration of his body, for the mind, as we said, is his spirit. Consequently, when the correspondence of these two motions ceases, a separation takes place, which is death.<p> </p>
<p>[2] The separation or death occurs when the body, owing to some illness or accident, comes into such a condition that it cannot operate in union with the person's spirit, for thus the correspondence perishes, and with the correspondence, conjunction. This eventuates not when the respiration alone ceases, but when the beating of the heart ceases; for as long as the heart beats, love with its vital warmth remains and maintains the body's life, as is apparent from cases of fainting and suffocation, and from the state of life of a fetus in the womb.<p>In short, the life of a person's body depends on the correspondence of its pulse and respiration with the pulse and respiration of his spirit, and when that correspondence ceases, the life of the body ceases, and his spirit departs and continues its life in the spiritual world, a life which is so like his life in the natural world that he does not know he has died.<p>Most people enter the spiritual world two days after leaving the body. Indeed, I have spoken two days afterward with some. </p>

<p>390. (vii) The conjunction of man's spirit with the body is by means of the correspondence of his will and understanding with his heart and lungs, and separation comes through non-correspondence. As it has been unknown hitherto that man's mind, that is, the will and understanding, is his spirit, and that the spirit is the man, and moreover, that man's spirit as well as his body has a pulse and respiration, it could not be known that the pulse and respiration of the spirit in man flow into the pulse and respiration of his body and produce them. Since, therefore, man's spirit, equally with his body, enjoys a pulse and respiration, it follows that there is a like correspondence of the pulse and respiration of a man's spirit with the pulse and respiration of his body, for, as was said, the mind is his spirit, consequently, when their dual motions cease to correspond, a separation comes, which is death. Separation or death occurs when, from some sickness or accident, the body comes into such a condition as to be unable to act in unison with its spirit, for thus correspondence perishes, and with it conjunction; not when respiration alone ceases, but when the heart beat ceases. For so long as the heart is in motion, love with its vital heat remains and preserves the life, as is clear from cases of swooning and suffocation, and from the condition of foetal life in the womb. In a word, man's bodily life depends on the correspondence of its pulse and respiration with the pulse and respiration of his spirit; and when that correspondence ceases, his bodily life ceases, and his spirit departs and continues its life in the spiritual world, which is so like his life in the natural world that he does not know that he has died. Most people are out of the body and in the spiritual world after a lapse of two days. I have spoken with some after two days. </p>

390. (7) The conjunction of man's spirit with his body is by means of the correspondence of his will and understanding with his heart and lungs, and their separation is from non- correspondence. As it has heretofore been unknown that man's mind, by which is meant the will and understanding, is his spirit, and that the spirit is a man; and as it has been unknown that man's spirit, as well as his body, has a pulse and respiration, it could not be known that the pulse and respiration of the spirit in man flow into the pulse and respiration of his body and produce them. Since, then, man's spirit, as well as his body, enjoys a pulse and respiration, it follows that there is a like correspondence of the pulse and respiration of man's spirit with the pulse and respiration of his body, - for, as was said, his mind is his spirit, - consequently, when the two pairs of motions cease to correspond, separation takes place, which is death. Separation or death ensues when from any kind of disease or accident the body comes into such a state as to be unable to act in unison with its spirit, for thus correspondence perishes, and with it conjunction; not, however, when respiration alone ceases, but when the heart's pulsation ceases. For so long as the heart is moved, love with its vital heat remains and preserves life, as is evident in cases of swoon and suffocation, and in the condition of fetal life in the womb. In a word, man's bodily life depends on the correspondence of its pulse and respiration with the pulse and respiration of his spirit; and when that correspondence ceases, the bodily life ceases, and his spirit departs and continues its life in the spiritual world, which is so similar to his life in the natural world that he does not know that he has died. Men generally enter the spiritual world two days after the death of the body. For I have spoken with some after two days. </p>

<p>390. VII. Quod conjunctio spiritus hominis cum corpore sit per correspondentiam voluntatis et intellectus ejus cum corde et pulmone ejus, et disjunctio per non correspondentiam. Quoniam hactenus ignotum fuit, quod Mens hominis, per quam intelligitur voluntas et intellectus, sit spiritus ejus, et quod spiritus sit homo, et ignotum fuit quod spiritui hominis aeque sit pulsus et respiratio, sicut est corpori, non sciri potuit quod pulsus et respiratio spiritus in homine influant in pulsum et respirationem corporis ejus, et producant illa. <sup>1</sup>
Cum itaque spiritus hominis pulsu et respiratione gaudet aeque ac corpus, sequitur quod similis correspondentia pulsus et respirationis spiritus hominis sit cum pulsu et respiratione corporis ejus, mens enim, ut est dictum, est spiritus ejus, quare cum correspondentia binorum illorum motuum cessat, fit separatio, quae est mors.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Separatio seu mors fit, quando corpus in illum statum venit, ex quocunque morbo aut casu, ut non possit unum agere cum suo spiritu, sic enim perit correspondentia, et cum correspondentia conjunctio; non cum sola respiratio cessat, sed cum pulsus cordis; nam quamdiu <sup>2</sup>
cor movetur, tamdiu amor cum suo calore vitali remanet, et vitam [corporis] conservat, ut patet a deliquiis, et a suffocationibus, tum a statu vitae embryonis in utero. Verbo, vita corporis hominis pendet a correspondentia pulsus et respirationis ejus cum pulsu et respiratione spiritus <sup>3</sup>
ejus, et cum correspondentia illa cessat, vita corporis cessat, et spiritus ejus abit, et continuat vitam suam in Mundo <sup>4</sup>
spirituali, quae tam <sup>5</sup>
similis est vitae ejus in Mundo naturali, ut non sciat quod decesserit. Plerique post biduum e corpore in Mundo spirituali sunt; post biduum enim cum aliquibus loquutus sum. <p>
