<h4 align="center"></h4><p>326、由此可见，从功用的角度看，宇宙万物类似一个人的形像，这证明神是一位人。因为前面所提到的那类事物不是从天使，而是从主经由天使而在天使人周围产生的。事实上，它们是从主的神性之爱和神性智慧进入作为接受者的天使的流注而产生的，因此这一切就像宇宙的创造那样在他们眼前产生。他们由此知道，神是一位人，并且从功用的角度看，宇宙就是神的一个形像。</p>

<p>
326. We can tell from all this, then, that if we focus on functions, there is a human image to everything in the universe. We can also tell that this testifies to the fact that God is human, because the things just listed do not come into being around angelic people from themselves, but from the Lord through them. They actually arise from the flow of divine love and wisdom into the angels, who are recipients, and are brought forth to their sight the way the universe is created. So people there know that God is human and that the created universe, functionally viewed, is an image of God. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #326 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
326. It can now be seen from this that regarded from the perspective of their uses, all constituents of the created universe resemble in an image the human being, and this attests to the fact that God is human. For the phenomena we enumerated above do not spring up around a person or angel from the angel, but from the Lord through the angel. They arise, in fact, from an influx of the Lord's Divine love and wisdom into the angel, who is their recipient vessel, and are produced before his eyes as a creation of the universe. Therefore they know in their world that God is human, and that the universe, regarded in terms of its uses, is an image of Him. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #326 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
326. It can now be established from these facts that all things in the universe, regarded from uses, represent man in an image, and that this proves that God is Man. For such things as have been mentioned above have existence about the angelic man, not from an angel, but from the Lord through an angel. For they have existence from the influx of the Lord's Divine Love and Wisdom with the angel who is a recipient, and before whose eyes all is brought forth just as the creation of a universe. From this they know there that God is Man, and that the created universe, regarded as to uses, is an image of Him. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #326 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
326. From all this it can be seen that all things in the universe, viewed from uses, have relation in an image to man, and that this testifies that God is a man. For such things as have been mentioned above take form about the angelic man, not from the angels, but from the Lord through the angels. For they take their form from the influx of the Lord's Divine Love and Divine Wisdom into the angel, who is a recipient, and before whose eyes all this is brought forth like the creation of a universe. From this they know there that God is a Man, and that the created universe, viewed in its uses, is an image of God. </p>

<p>
326. Ex his nunc constare potest, quod omnia Universi ex usibus spectata referant in imagine hominem, et quod id testetur, quod Deus sit Homo: nam talia, quae supra memorata sunt, non existunt circum hominem Angelum, ex Angelo, sed ex Domino per angelum; existunt enim ex influxu Divini amoris et Divinae Sapientiae Domini in Angelum, qui est recipiens, et producuntur <sup>1</sup>
coram oculis ejus sicut creatio Universi; ex quo norunt ibi, quod Deus sit Homo, et quod Universum creatum quoad usus spectatum sit imago Ipsius. <p>1 Prima editio: producitur </p>
