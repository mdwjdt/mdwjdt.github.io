<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第137节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>137、既然心智的内层与身体的内层构成一体，那么可知，当心智的内层转向显为太阳的主时，身体的内层同样转向主。心智与身体这二者的外层皆取决于它们的内层，故也转向主。因为外在所行的，都是出于内在而行的，总体从构成它的细节获得它的一切。由此明显可知，由于天使将脸和身体转向显为太阳的主，所以其心智和身体的一切内层也转向主。世人若始终有主在眼前，也就是处于爱和智慧，也是一样。这时，不仅他的眼和脸仰望主，而且整个心智和整个内心也仰望主，也就是说，意愿和理解力的一切，连同身体的一切都转向主。</p>

137. Given the fact that the deeper levels of the mind act in unison with the deeper levels of the body, it follows that when the deeper levels of the mind turn toward the Lord as the sun, the deeper levels of the body do the same. Further, since the outer levels of both body and mind depend on their inner levels, they behave in the same way. The outer does what it does at the prompting of the inner, since a collective body derives its whole nature from its specific components. We can see from this that because an angel is turning face and body toward the Lord as the sun, the inner levels of that angel's mind and body have been turned in that direction as well.<p>It is the same with us. If we constantly keep the Lord before our eyes (which happens if we are engaged in love and wisdom), then it is not only our eyes and faces that turn to him, it is our whole mind and our whole heart. That is, it is everything in our intentions and minds and everything in our body at the same time. </p>

137. Since the interior elements of the mind operate in concert with the interior elements of the body, it follows that when the interior elements of the mind turn to the Lord as the sun, the interior elements of the body also do likewise; and that because the outward elements of each, of both the mind and the body, depend on their interior elements, these outward elements do the same as well. For whatever the outward component does, it does in consequence of the inner ones, inasmuch as the common whole takes all its character from the particular elements which form it.<p>It is apparent from this that because an angel turns his face and body to the Lord as the sun, all the interior elements of his mind and body are turned in that direction too.<p>The case is the same with a person if he continually has the Lord before his eyes, which he does if he is in a state of love and wisdom. He then beholds the Lord not only with his eyes and face, but with his whole mind and heart as well; that is, he regards Him with all the constituents of his will and intellect, and at the same time with all the constituents of his body. </p>

137. Since the interiors of the mind make one with the interiors of the body it follows that when the interiors of the mind turn themselves to the Lord as a Sun, the interiors of the body also do likewise. And because the exteriors of both, of the mind as well as of the body depend upon their interiors, they also do likewise. For what the external does, it does from internals, the general deriving its all from the particulars from which it is. From these things it is clear that because the angel turns his face and body to the Lord as a Sun, all the interior things of his mind and body also are turned hither. It is the same with man if he has the Lord constantly before his eyes, which is the case if he is in love and wisdom. He then looks to the Lord not only with eyes and face, but even with his whole mind and heart, that is, with all the things of the will and understanding together with all the things of the body. </p>

137. Since the interiors of the mind make one with the interiors of the body, it follows that when the interiors of the mind turn themselves to the Lord as a sun, those of the body turn themselves in like manner; and because the exteriors of both, of mind as well as body, depend upon their interiors, they also do the same. For what the external does, it does from internals, the general deriving all it has from the particulars from which it is. From this it is evident that as an angel turns his face and body to the Lord as a sun, all the interiors of his mind and body are turned in the same direction. It is the same with man, if he has the Lord constantly before his eyes, which is the case if he is in love and wisdom. He then looks to the Lord not only with eyes and face, but also with all the mind and all the heart, that is, with all things of the will and understanding, together with all things of the body. </p>

<p>
137. Quoniam interiora mentis unum faciunt cum interioribus corporis, sequitur quod dum interiora mentis se vertunt ad Dominum ut Solem, etiam interiora corporis similiter faciant, <sup>1</sup>
et quia exteriora utriusque, tam mentis quam corporis, ab interioribus eorum pendent, quod etiam illa similiter faciant; quod enim externum facit, hoc facit ab internis, nam commune trahit omne suum a particularibus, a quibus est. Ex his patet, quod quia Angelus vertit faciem et corpus ad Dominum ut Solem, etiam omnia interiora mentis et corporis ejus illuc versa sint. Simile est cum homine, si ille jugiter habet Dominum ante oculos, quod fit si in amore et sapientia est[;] tunc non modo oculis et facie Ipsum spectat, sed etiam tota mente et toto corde, hoc est, omnibus voluntatis et intellectus, et simul omnibus corporis. <p>
