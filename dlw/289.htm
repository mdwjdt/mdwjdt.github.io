<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第289节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>289、由此可见，那些认为神不是一位人，认为神性属性不在作为一位人的神里面的人所持的观念何等空虚！因为它们若与人分离，纯粹就是虚构的想象。神正是一位人，因此每个人都照着他接受爱和智慧的程度而为一个人(参看11-13节)。在此证实这一点是为了接下来的内容，以便读者能明白，神因着祂是一位人而创造了宇宙。</p>

<p>
289. This shows us the senselessness of concepts people have when they think about God in nonhuman terms and about divine attributes as not being in a human God. Separated from person, these concepts are nothing but theoretical constructs.<p>On God as the essential person, from whom we are human by virtue of our acceptance of love and wisdom, see <a href="11.htm" target=_top>11-13</a> above. I stress this here for the sake of what follows, to make it clear that the universe was created by God because God is a person. </p>

<p>
289. One can see from this the emptiness of the ideas held by people who think of God other than as human, and of Divine attributes other than as being in God as a person, because when separated from the concept of a person they are purely figments of the imagination.<p>It may be seen in nos. <a href="11.htm">11-13</a> above that God is supremely human; and every person is therefore human in the measure of his reception of love and wisdom. We affirm the same point here for the sake of the ensuing discussions, in order that the reader may comprehend the creation of the universe by God because of His being human. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #289 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
289. From these facts it can be seen how inane are the ideas of those who think of God as something other than a Man, and of the Divine attributes as not being in God as a Man, since these attributes, separated from man are mere figments of the imagination. It may be seen above (<a href="11.htm">11-13</a>) that God is Very Man, from Whom every man is man in accordance with his reception of love and wisdom. This is here confirmed on account of what follows, that the creation of the universe by God, because He is a Man, may be perceived. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #289 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
289. All this makes evident how empty are the ideas of those who think of God as something else than a Man, and of the Divine attributes as not being in God as a Man, since these separated from man are mere figments of reason. That God is very Man, from whom every man is a man according to his reception of love and wisdom, may be seen above (n. <a href="11.htm" target=_top>11-13</a>). This truth is here corroborated on account of what follows, that the creation of the universe by God, because He is a Man, may be perceived. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #289 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
289. Ex his videri potest inanitas idearum apud illos, qui cogitant de Deo aliter quam de Homine, ac de Attributis Divinis aliter quam quod sint in Deo ut Homine, quia separata ab Homine sunt pura entia rationis. Quod Deus sit Ipse Homo, ex quo omnis homo est homo secundum receptionem amoris et sapientiae, videatur supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_289/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_11" target=_top>11-13</a>; idem hic confirmatur propter <sup>1</sup>
sequentia, ut percipiatur Creatio universi a Deo quia est Homo. <p>
