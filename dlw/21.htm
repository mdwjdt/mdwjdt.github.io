<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第21节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>21、由于神-人里面有无限事物显现在天堂、天使和世人里面，如同显现在一面镜子中；且由于神-人不在空间中(如7-10节所示)，所以我们能在某种程度上看出并理解神如何能全在、全知和全能；作为一位人又如何能创造万物，作为一位人能将祂所造的万物保持在它们的秩序中，直到永远。</p>

21. Since there are infinite things in the Divine-Human One, things that are so to speak reflected in heaven, in angels, and in us, and since the Divine-Human One is not in space (see <a href="7.htm" target=_top>7-10</a> above), we can see and understand to some extent how God can be omnipresent, omniscient, and omniprovident, and how, even as a person, he could have created everything, and how as a person he can forever keep everything he has created in its proper order. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #21 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
21. Because there are infinite elements in the human God, which appear in heaven, in angels, and in people as in a mirror, and because the human God does not exist in space (as shown above in nos. <a href="7.htm">7-10</a>), it can be seen and comprehended to some extent how God can be omnipresent, omniscient, and all-providing; and how as a person He could create all things, and can as a person hold all things created by Him in their proper order to eternity. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #21 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
21. Because in God-Man there are infinite things which, in heaven, in an angel, in a man, appear as in a mirror, and because God-Man is not in space-as was shown above (<a href="7.htm">7-10</a>), it can, to some extent, be seen and comprehended how God can be Omnipresent, Omniscient, and Omniprovident, and how as Man He could create all things, and as Man can hold all the things created by Himself in their order to eternity. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #21 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
21. Because in God-Man there are infinite things which appear in heaven, in angel, and in man, as in a mirror; and because God-Man is not in space (as was shown above, n. <a href="7.htm" target=_top>7-10</a>), it can, to some extent, be seen and comprehended how God can be Omnipresent, Omniscient, and All-providing; and how, as Man, He could create all things, and as Man can hold the things created by Himself in their order to eternity. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #21 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
21. Quia Infinita in Deo Homine [sunt], quae in Coelo, in Angelo et in Homine, ut in speculo apparent, et quia Deus Homo non est in spatio, ut supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_21/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_7" target=_top>7-10</a>, ostensum est, aliquantum videri et comprehendi potest, quomodo Deus potest Omnipraesens, Omnisciens, et Omniprovidens esse; ac quomodo ut Homo potuerit creare omnia, ac ut Homo possit in aeternum tenere creata ab Ipso in suo ordine. </p>
