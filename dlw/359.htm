<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第359节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>359、人不可能是按着神样式的神的形像，除非神在他里面，并从至内在就是他的生命。神在人里面，并从至内在就是他的生命，这一点从前面的说明(4-6节)可推知，即：唯独神是生命，世人和天使是从祂接受生命者。此外，从圣言可知，神在人里面，与他同住。由于这是从圣言得知的，所以牧师或传道者通常告诉人们说，要预备自己接受神，好叫祂能进入他们，在他们心里，使他们成为神的居所。虔诚的人在祷告时也这么说，有些人在谈到圣灵时更是公开宣称，当处于神圣热情的状态，并出于这种热情思考、说话和传道时，他们相信圣灵就在自己里面。在《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》中(51-53节)已说明，圣灵就是主，而不是单独为一个位格的一位神。因为主说：<br><br>到那日，你们就知道你们在我里面，我也在你们里面。(约翰福音14:20; 15:4, 5; 17:23)</p>

359. We could not be images of God according to his likeness unless he were within us and were our life from our very center. God's presence within us and God's being our life from our very center follow from what I explained in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_21.htm" target=_top>John 14:21</a> [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm" target=_top>20</a>]), and he says similar things in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_24.htm" target=_top>John 15:24</a> [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm" target=_top>4</a>] and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_23.htm" target=_top>John 17:23</a>. </p>

359. A person cannot be an image of God according to His likeness unless God is in him and inmostly is his life. The fact that God is in people and inmostly is their life follows from the observations demonstrated above in nos. <a href="4.htm">4-6</a>, that God alone is life, and that people and angels are recipients of life from Him.<p>It is known from the Word that God is in people and makes His abode in them. <sup>1</sup>
And because this is known from the Word, it is customary for preachers to tell people to prepare themselves to receive God, that He may enter into them and be in their hearts, and that they may be His habitation. The devout speak likewise in their prayers. Some people speak still more openly so of the Holy Spirit, which they believe to be in them when they are in a state of holy zeal and are thinking, speaking and preaching in consequence of it.<p>We have shown in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord, nos. <a href="50.htm">50-53</a>, that the Holy Spirit is the Lord, and not some God who is a person in Himself. For the Lord says, "On that day you will know that you (are) in Me, and I in you" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>). (So likewise <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_23.htm">17:23</a>.)<p>

359. Man cannot be an image of God after His likeness, unless God is in him and is his life from the inmost. That God is in man, and is his life from the inmost, follows from what was shown above (<a href="4.htm">4-6</a>) namely, that God alone is Life, and that men and angels are recipients of life from Him. Moreover, it is well known from the Word that God is in man, and makes His abode with him; and because it is known from the Word, it is customary for preachers to declare that men should be prepared to receive God, that He may enter into them, and be in their hearts, that they may be His dwelling-place. The devout man says the same in his prayers, and so do some more openly regarding the Holy Spirit, which they believe is in them when they are in holy zeal, and from that zeal think, speak, and preach. That the Holy Spirit is the Lord, and not some other God who is a Person by Himself, has been shown in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD (<a href="../ss/51.htm">51-53</a>). For the Lord declares: <p>In that day ye shall know that ye are in Me, and I in you. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_20.htm">John 12:20</a>; likewise, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">15:4-5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_23.htm">17:23</a> </p>

359. Homo non potest esse imago Dei secundum similitudinem Ipsius, nisi Deus sit in illo, et sit vita ejus ab intimo: quod Deus sit in homine, et ab intimo sit vita ejus, sequitur ex illis quae supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_359/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_4" target=_top>4-6</a> <sup>1</sup>
demonstrata sunt, quod Solus Deus sit vita, et quod homines et angeli sint recipientes vitae ab Ipso. Notum etiam est ex Verbo, quod Deus sit in homine, et quod mansionem apud illum faciat; et quia notum est ex Verbo, solenne est praedicatoribus dicere, ut praeparent se ad recipiendum Deum, ut intret in illos, ut sit in cordibus eorum, ut sint habitaculum Ipsius; similiter loquitur devotus in precibus; ita quidam apertius de Spiritu Sancto, quem credunt in ipsis esse, dum in sancto Zelo sunt, et ex illo cogitant, loquuntur et praedicant: quod Spiritus Sanctus sit Dominus, et non aliquis Deus qui est persona per se, in DOCTRINA NOVAE HIEROSOLYMAE DE DOMINO, [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_359/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_50" target=_top>50</a>,] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_359/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_51" target=_top>51-53</a>, ostensum est: dicit enim Dominus[,] "In die illo cognoscetis, quod vos in Me, et Ego in vobis,["] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_359/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_20" target=_top>Johannes 14:20</a>. <sup>2</sup>
