<h4 align="center"></h4><p>94、这属灵之火(它在源头上也有光在里面)变成属灵之热与光；属灵之热与光随着发出而减弱，这种减弱是通过层级进行的；关于层级，我们会在下文予以论述。古人以神头上所环绕的火红而又光辉灿烂的光环来表现这种发出，这在当今表现神为一位人的绘画中也很常见。</p>

94. The spiritual fire where light dwells in its origin becomes a spiritual warmth and light that decrease as they emanate, with the decrease occurring by levels that will be discussed later. The ancients pictured this as brightly gleaming circles of reddish fire around the head of God, a form of representation that is still common today when God is portrayed as human in paintings. </p>

94. This spiritual fire - which has in it also light in its origin - becomes spiritual heat and light which decrease as they emanate, and the decrease takes place by degrees, degrees which we will consider in later discussions.<p>Ancient peoples represented this emanation by placing halos glowing with fire and glistening with light around the head of God, a representation which is also commonly employed today when God is depicted as a person in paintings. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #94 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
94. This spiritual fire, in which also there is light in its origin, becomes spiritual heat and light, which decrease in [their] going forth; and the decrease takes place by degrees which will be treated of in what follows. This was represented by the Ancients by circles glowing with fire and resplendent with light around God's head. And this representation is also common today, when God is presented in pictures as a Man. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #94 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
94. This spiritual fire, in which also there is light in its origin, becomes spiritual heat and light, which decrease in their going forth. This decrease is effected by degrees, which will be treated of in what follows. The ancients represented this by circles glowing with fire and resplendent with light around the head of God, as is common also at the present day in paintings representing God as a Man. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #94 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
94. Ille Ignis spiritualis, in quo etiam Lux est in sua origine, fit calor et lux spiritualis, quae decrescunt in procedendo, et decrescentia fit per gradus, de quibus in sequentibus. Hoc ab Antiquis repraesentatum est per Circulos ex igne rutilos et ex luce splendentes circum Caput Dei, quae repraesentatio etiam hodie communis est, cum sistitur Deus ut Homo in picturis. </p>
