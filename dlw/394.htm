<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">5.4 关于意愿和理解力，或爱和智慧，因而关于人类灵魂所能知道的一切事，都可从心与意愿并理解力与肺的对应关系中得知</h4><p>394、在学术界，许多人都在努力探索灵魂。但他们因对灵界和人死后的状态一无所知，所以只能构建假说，这些假说并未涉及灵魂的性质，只涉及灵魂在身体里面的运作。对于灵魂的性质，他们没有其它概念，只是认为它就像以太中最纯粹的某种实体；对于包含它的形式，他们也没有其它概念，只是认为它就像以太。然而，他们不敢过多地公开谈论这个问题，害怕将某种属世特征归给灵魂，因为他们知道灵魂是属灵的。<br><br>由于对灵魂持有这种观念，然而又知道灵魂在身体里面运作，并产生其中与感觉和活动有关的一切效果，所以如前所述，他们就努力研究灵魂在身体里面的运作。有人认为这种运作是通过流注实现的，有人认为是通过这二者的和谐实现的。但由于这种努力调查并未发现任何能使得渴望看见真相的心智安息的东西，所以我蒙恩得以与天使交谈，在这个问题上被他们的智慧光照。我从他们的智慧中获得以下成果：死后活着的人的灵魂就是他的灵；这灵是一个完整形式的人；该形式的灵魂就是意愿和理解力，而意愿和理解力的灵魂则是来自主的爱和智慧；这二者构成人的生命，这生命唯独来自主；为了人能接受衪，主使生命看似属于人；但为免人将生命归给自己，当成自己的，因而远离对主的这种接受，主也教导，被称为良善的爱的一切和被称为真理的智慧的一切都来自祂，无一来自人；并且由于这二者就是生命，所以系生命的生命的一切都来自祂。</p>

394. From the correspondence of the heart with volition and the lungs with discernment, we can learn everything that can be known about volition and discernment or love and wisdom--everything, therefore, that can be known about the human soul. A host of people in learned circles have sweated over their research about the soul. However, since they have not known anything about the spiritual world and our state after death, all they have been able to do has been to formulate theories not about the nature of the soul but about how it works in the body. Their only conceivable notion of the nature of the soul was of something supremely pure, something in the ether, with the ether itself as its vehicle. They have not dared publish much about this for fear of attributing something physical to the soul when they knew that the soul was spiritual.<p>Given this concept of the soul as well as the knowledge that the soul is at work in the body producing everything involved in sensation and motion, they have, as I just noted, sweated over their research into the way the soul works in the body. Some have stated that this happens by an inflow, others that it happens by a harmony. However, since this has led to no discoveries satisfactory to a mind that wants to see whether something is true or not, I have been granted the privilege of talking with angels and becoming enlightened on the matter through their wisdom. One item of their wisdom is that the human soul that lives after death is the human spirit and that it is a perfectly formed person. Further, this soul of ours is our volition and discernment, whose soul is love and wisdom from the Lord. It is these two that constitute our life, a life that is from the Lord alone and that is the Lord. To enable us to accept him, he makes us feel as though this life belongs to us; but to prevent us from claiming life as our own possession and thereby undermining our ability to accept him, the Lord teaches us that every element of love that we call good and every element of wisdom that we call true comes from him. Nothing of it comes from us; and since these two are our life, every trace of life that is really alive comes from him. </p>

<p>394. From the correspondence of the heart with the will and of the intellect with the lungs, everything may be known that can be known about the will and intellect, or love and wisdom, thus about the human soul. Many in the learned world have toiled in an inquiry into the soul. But because they have known nothing about the spiritual world and a person's state after death, they have been unable to do anything other than to construct hypotheses, not about the nature of the soul, but about its operation in the body. Of the nature of the soul they have been unable to form any other idea than of its being like some purest entity in the ether, and of the environment in which it exists as being like the ether. Yet they have not dared to make public more than a little of this, for fear of attributing to the soul some natural characteristic, knowing that the soul is spiritual.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Now because they have had this conception of the soul, and yet have known that the soul operates in the body and produces all its effects relating to its sensation and movement, therefore they have toiled, as we said, in an inquiry into the operation of the soul in the body, which some have said is accomplished by influx, and some by a harmony of the two.<p>However, because by this effort nothing has been discovered that can put to rest the mind which wishes to see whether a thing is so, therefore I have been granted to speak with angels and to be enlightened regarding this matter by their wisdom. I have from their wisdom the following: that the human soul which lives after death is a person's spirit; that this spirit is in complete form human; that its soul is the will and intellect, and that the soul of these is love and wisdom from the Lord; that these two are what constitute a person's life, which comes from the Lord alone; and that for Him to be received by the person, the Lord causes the life to appear as though it were the person's. Nevertheless, to keep people from attributing life to themselves as theirs and so turning away from a reception of Him, the Lord also taught that every element of love that is called good, and every element of wisdom that is called truth, comes from Him, and nothing of them from any person, and that because these two are life, every element of life that is life comes from Him. </p>

<p>394. FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HEART WITH THE WILL AND THE UNDERSTANDING WITH THE LUNGS EVERYTHING MAY BE KNOWN THAT CAN BE KNOWN ABOUT THE WILL AND UNDERSTANDING, OR ABOUT LOVE AND WISDOM, AND THUS ABOUT MAN'S SOUL <p>Many in the learned world have toiled laboriously in search of the soul; but because they knew nothing of the spiritual world and of man's state after death, they could only frame theories of the operation of the soul in the body, not of its nature. The only idea they have been able to reach of what the soul is like is of something most pure in the ether, and of its containing form as of something ethereal. Concerning this, however, they have ventured only generalities lest they ascribed anything natural to the soul, knowing that the soul is spiritual. Now, because they had conceived such an idea of the soul and yet know perfectly well that the soul operates in the body and produces everything that has to do with its sensation and motion, they have, as was said, laboured hard in research on the operation of the soul in the body, which some have held to be effected by influx and some by harmony. But as nothing has been discovered in this way in which the mind, desirous of seeing if it be so, can acquiesce, it has been granted me to speak with angels, and to be enlightened on this subject by their wisdom, of which the following is a summary. Man's soul, which lives after death, is his spirit, and it is man in complete form; the soul of this form is the will and understanding and the soul of these is love and wisdom from the Lord. These two faculties are what constitute man's life, which is from the Lord alone. For the sake of reception of Him by man, the Lord causes it to appear that life, is, as it were, man's own; but, lest he should ascribe life to himself as his own and thus withdraw himself from reception of the Lord, the Lord has also taught that everything of love, which is called good, and everything of wisdom, which is called truth, come from Him, and nothing of them from man; and since these two are life, that everything of life which is life comes from Him. </p>

394. FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HEART WITH THE WILL AND OF THE LUNGS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING, EVERYTHING MAY BE KNOWN THAT CAN BE KNOWN ABOUT THE WILL AND UNDERSTANDING, OR ABOUT LOVE AND WISDOM, THEREFORE ABOUT THE SOUL OF MAN. <p>Many in the learned world have wearied themselves with inquiries respecting the soul; but as they knew nothing of the spiritual world, or of man's state after death, they could only frame theories, not about the nature of the soul, but about its operation on the body. Of the nature of the soul they could have no idea except as something most pure in the ether, and of its containing form they could have no idea except as being ethereal. But knowing that the soul is spiritual, they dared not say much about the matter openly, for fear of ascribing to the soul something natural. With this conception of the soul, and yet knowing that the soul operates on the body, and produces all things in it that relate to its sensation and motion, they have wearied themselves, as was said, with inquiries respecting the operation of the soul on the body. This has been held by some to be effected by influx, and by some to be effected by harmony. But as this investigation has disclosed nothing in which the mind anxious to see the real truth can acquiesce, it has been granted me to speak with angels, and to be enlightened on the subject by their wisdom; the fruits of which are as follows: Man's soul, which lives after death, is his spirit, and is in complete form a man; the soul of this form is the will and understanding, and the soul of these is love and wisdom from the Lord; these two are what constitute man's life, which is from the Lord above; yet for the sake of man's reception of Him, He causes life to appear as if it were man's; but that man may not claim life for himself as his, and thus withdraw himself from this reception of the Lord, the Lord has also taught that everything of love, which is called good, and everything of wisdom, which is called truth, is from Him, and nothing of these from man; and as these two are life, that everything of life which is life is from Him. </p>

<p>394. QUOD EX CORRESPONDENTIA CORDIS CUM VOLUNTATE ET INTELLECTUS CUM PULMONE, SCIRI POSSINT OMNIA QUAE DE VOLUNTATE ET INTELLECTU, SEU DE AMORE ET SAPIENTIA, ITA QUAE DE ANIMA HOMINIS, SCIRI POSSUNT. In Orbe erudito sudarunt multi in inquisitione de Anima; sed quia nihil sciverunt de Mundo spirituali, et de statu hominis post mortem, non potuerunt aliter quam condere hypotheses, non de anima qualis est, sed de operatione ejus in corpus: de anima qualis est, non potuerunt aliam ideam habere, quam sicut de purissimo quodam in aethere, et de ejus continente quam sicut de aethere; de hoc tamen non ausi sunt nisi pauca vulgare, ne aliquid naturale Animae addicarent, scientes quod Anima spiritualis sit.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Nunc quia ita conceperunt Animam, et tamen notum illis fuit, quod Anima operetur in Corpus, et producat <sup>1</sup>
omnia ejus, quae ad sensum et ad motum ejus se referunt, ideo sudarunt, ut dictum est, in inquisitione de operatione Animae in corpus, quam quidam dixerunt fieri per influxum, et quidam per harmoniam: sed quia sic non aliquid detectum est, in quo Mens, quae videre vult num ita sit, acquiescere potest, ideo mihi datum est loqui cum Angelis, et per illorum sapientiam de ea re illustrari; ex qua hoc est, quod Anima hominis, quae vivit post mortem, sit ejus spiritus, et quod ille sit in perfecta forma homo, et quod hujus anima sit voluntas et intellectus, et quod horum anima sit Amor et Sapientia a Domino, et quod haec duo sint quae faciunt vitam hominis, quae a Solo Domino est[,] et quod Dominus <sup>2</sup>
faciat propter receptionem Ipsius ab homine, ut vita appareat sicut sit hominis; sed ne homo vitam addicat sibi ut suam, et sic se a receptione Ipsius subducat, etiam Dominus docuit quod omne amoris quod vocatur bonum, et omne sapientiae quod vocatur verum, sit ab Ipso, et nihil eorum ab homine; et quia illa duo sunt vita, quod omne vitae, quod vita, sit ab Ipso. <p>
