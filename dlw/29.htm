<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第29节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>29、就其本质而言，爱与智慧一起在神里面。这一点无可否认，因为神以祂里面的爱来爱每一个人，以祂里面的智慧来引导每一个人。同样，受造宇宙就其秩序而言，如此充满源于爱的智慧，甚至可以说，万物整体上就是智慧本身；因为无限事物都处于既连续，又同步地集合起来构成一体这样的秩序中。正是因此，也唯独因此，它们才能被联结起来并持续存在。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #29 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
29. No one can deny that in God we find love and wisdom together in their very essence. He loves us all out of the love that is within him, and he guides us all out of the wisdom that is within him.<p>Further, if you look at the created universe with an eye to its design, it is so full of wisdom from love that you might say everything taken all together is wisdom itself. There are things without measure in such a pattern, both sequential and simultaneous, that taken all together they constitute a single entity. This is the only reason they can be held together and sustained forever. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #29 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
29. No one can deny that God possesses in Him love and wisdom together in their very essence. For He loves all people out of the love in Him, and He guides all out of the wisdom in Him.<p>The created universe, too, regarded in terms of its design, is so full of wisdom springing from love that you may declare all its facets in their entirety to be wisdom itself. For it contains incalculable elements so organized sequentially and concurrently that taken together they constitute a single unit. It is for this reason and no other that they can be held together and unceasingly maintained. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #29 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
29. It cannot be denied by anyone that Love together with Wisdom in its very essence is in God. For He loves everyone from Love in Itself and leads everyone from Wisdom in Itself. The created universe also, regarded from order, is so full of wisdom [coming forth] from love, that you may say all things in the aggregate are wisdom itself. For limitless (indefinita) things are in such order, successively and simultaneously that, taken together, they make a one. It is from this cause and no other that they can be held together and continually preserved. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #29 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
29. Love together with wisdom in its very essence is in God. This no one can deny; for God loves every one from love in Himself, and leads every one from wisdom in Himself. The created universe, too, viewed in relation to its order, is so full of wisdom coming forth from love that all things in the aggregate may be said to be wisdom itself. For things limitless are in such order, successively and simultaneously, that taken together they make a one. It is from this, and this alone, that they can be held together and continually preserved. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #29 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
29. Quod in Deo sit Amor et simul Sapientia in ipsa sua essentia, a nemine negari potest; amat enim omnes ex Amore in Se, et ducit omnes ex Sapientia in Se. <sup>1</sup>
Universum etiam Creatum ex Ordine spectatum, est ita plenum Sapientia ex Amore, ut dicas omnia in complexu illam ipsam esse; sunt enim indefinita in tali ordine, successive et simultanee, ut simul sumta unum faciant; ex eo et non aliunde est, quod contineri et in perpetuum conservari possint. <p>
