<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第127节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>127、为了爱与智慧能在天使或世人里面构成一体，身体的所有组成部分都是成双成对的。如眼、耳、鼻是成对的；手、腰、足也是成对的；脑分为两个半球，心分为两个心室，肺分为两个肺叶，其它部位同样如此。因此，天使和世人有左右之分；右边的所有部位都与产生智慧的爱有关；左边的所有部位都与爱所产生的智慧有关。或也可说，右边的所有部位都与产生真理的良善有关；左边的所有部位都与良善所产生的真理有关。天使和世人有这些成双成对的部位，是为了爱与智慧，或良善与真理能行如一体，作为一体关注主。有关该主题的详情可参看下文。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #127 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
127. For love and wisdom to be a single whole in angels and in us, there are pairs throughout our bodies. Our eyes, ears, and nostrils are paired, our hands, sides, and feet are paired, our brains are divided into two hemispheres, our heart into two chambers, our lungs into two lobes, and so on. So for both angels and for us there is a right side and a left side; and all the right side parts have to do with the love that gives rise to wisdom, while all the left side parts have to do with the wisdom of that love. We could also say, which amounts to the same thing, that all the right side parts have to do with the good that gives rise to the true and all the left side parts with what is true because of that goodness.<p>Both we and angels have these pairs so that love and wisdom, or what is good and what is true, may act in unison and focus on the Lord in unison--but there will be more on this later [<a href="384.htm" target=_top>384</a>, <a href="409.htm" target=_top>409</a>]. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #127 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
127. In order that love and wisdom in an angel or person may be united, there are paired elements in all the constituents of his body. His eyes, ears and nostrils are paired organs. His hands, loins and feet are paired. The brain is divided into two hemispheres, the heart into two chambers, the lungs into two lobes, and so on with other organs. Thus we find in angels and people a right side and a left; and all their constituents located to the right relate to love which gives rise to wisdom, and all their constituents located to the left relate to wisdom arising from love; or to say the equivalent, all their constituents located to the right relate to good which gives rise to truth, and all their constituents located to the left relate to truth arising from good.<p>Angels and people have these pairs in order that love and wisdom, or good and truth, may operate in union and look as one to the Lord. But more on this subject in subsequent discussions. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #127 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
127. In order that love and wisdom may make one with an angel and with a man, there are pairs in all things of his body. The eyes, ears and nostrils are pairs, the hands, loins and feet are pairs. The brain is divided into two hemispheres, the heart into two chambers, the lungs into two lobes, and similarly the other parts. Thus in an angel and a man there is the right and the left. And all their right parts have relation to love from which is wisdom, and all the left parts to truth from good. An angel and a man have these pairs so that love and wisdom, or good and truth may act as one, and as one, may look to the Lord. But of this matter more will be said in what follows. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #127 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
127. In order that love and wisdom may make one in an angel or in a man, there are pairs in all the things of his body. The eyes, ears, and nostrils are pairs; the hands, loins, and feet are pairs; the brain is divided into two hemispheres, the heart into two chambers, the lungs into two lobes, and in like manner the other parts. Thus in angel and man there is right and left; and all their right parts have relation to the love from which wisdom comes; and all the left parts, to the wisdom which is from love; or, what is the same, all the right parts have relation to the good from which truth comes; and all the left parts, to the truth that is from good. Angel and man have these pairs in order that love and wisdom, or good and truth, may act as one, and as one, may have regard to the Lord. But of this more in what follows. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #127 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
127. Ut amor et sapientia apud angelum et apud hominem unum faciant, sunt paria in omnibus corporis ejus; oculi, aures et nares sunt paria; manus, lumbi et pedes sunt paria; cerebrum in duo haemisphaeria divisum est, cor in binas cameras, pulmo in binos lobos, similiter reliqua; ita in angelo et homine est dextrum et sinistrum; et omnes partes dextrae eorum se referunt ad amorem ex quo sapientia, et omnes partes sinistrae ad sapientiam ex amore, seu quod idem, omnes partes dextrae ad bonum ex quo verum, et omnes partes sinistrae ad verum ex bono. Haec paria angelo et homini sunt, ut amor et sapientia, seu bonum et verum[,] unum agant, ac ut unum spectent ad Dominum: sed de hac re plura in sequentibus. </p>
