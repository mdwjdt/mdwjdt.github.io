<h4 align="center"></h4><p>153、主通过两个太阳创造一切事物，即灵界的太阳和自然界的太阳。主创造一切事物是通过灵界太阳，而非自然界的太阳，因为后者远在前者之下。自然界的太阳处于中间位置，上面是灵界，下面是自然界。自然界的太阳被造是为了提供辅助性的帮助；我们会在下文详述这种帮助。</p>

153. There are two suns by means of which the Lord created everything, the sun of the spiritual world and the sun of the physical world. The Lord created everything by means of the spiritual world's sun, but not by means of the physical world's sun, since this latter sun is far beneath the former one. The spiritual sun is at a midpoint, with the spiritual world above it and the physical world below it. The physical world's sun was created to play a supporting role, a role that will be discussed below [<a href="157.htm" target=_top>157</a>]. </p>

153. There are two suns by which the Lord created all things - the sun in the spiritual world and the sun in the natural world. The Lord created all things by means of the sun in the spiritual world and not by means of the sun in the natural world, for the sun in the natural world is far below the sun in the spiritual world. The sun in the natural world is in an intermediate position. Above it is the spiritual world, and below it is the natural world. And the sun in the natural world was created to contribute subsidiary assistance. (We will say more about this assistance in subsequent discussions.) </p>

<p>
153. There are two suns through which all things have been created by the Lord. There is the sun of the spiritual world and the sun of the natural world. By means of the Sun of the spiritual world all things have been created by the Lord, but not by means of the sun of the natural world for the latter is far below the former. It is in middle distance; above it is the spiritual world, and below it is the natural world. And the sun of the natural world was created to render subsidiary aid. This aid will be spoken of in what follows. </p>

<p>
153. There are two suns through which all things were created by the Lord, the sun of the spiritual world and the sun of the natural world. All things were created by the Lord through the sun of the spiritual world, but not through the sun of the natural world, since the latter is far below the former; it is in middle distance; above it is the spiritual world and below it is the natural world. This sun of the natural world was created to render aid, as a kind of substitute; this aid will be spoken of in what follows. </p>

153. Sunt bini Soles, per quos omnia a Domino creata sunt, Sol Mundi spiritualis et Sol Mundi naturalis; per Solem Mundi spiritualis a Domino sunt omnia creata, non autem per Solem Mundi naturalis, nam hic Sol est longe infra illum Solem; est in media distantia[;] supra illum est Mundus spiritualis, et infra illum est Mundus naturalis; et Sol Mundi naturalis creatus est, ut succenturiatam opem ferat; de qua ope in sequentibus dicetur. </p>
