<h4 align="center"></h4><p>204、在先元素似乎不如随后元素完美，也就是说，简单物似乎不如复合物完美。然而，形成随后元素的在先元素，也就是形成复合物的简单物更完美。原因在于，在先元素或简单物更裸露，被无生命的物质材料包裹得更少，可以说，更具神性，因而更接近主所在的属灵太阳。因为完美本身在主里面，从祂而在属灵太阳，就是祂的神性之爱和神性智慧的首先发出里面，由此而在那些紧随其后的元素里面，以此类推，依次直到因越发远离而越来越不完美的最低级元素。如果在先元素和简单物没有这种超乎寻常的完美在里面，那么无论人还是动物，都无法从精子生出，然后继续存活；树木和灌木的种子也无法发芽、生长，结出果实。因为在先元素越在先，简单物越简单，就越完美，因而越不受伤害。</p>

204. It may seem as though antecedent things are less perfect than subsequent ones and constituent things are less perfect than compounds, but in fact the antecedent things that give rise to subsequent ones are more perfect, as are the constituents from which compounds are formed. This is because the antecedent or constituent things are less covered, less shrouded by lifeless substances and materials. They are more divine, so to speak, and as such are closer to the spiritual sun where the Lord is. Perfection itself is in the Lord and therefore in the sun that is the first emanation of his divine love and wisdom. It comes from there into things that are next in sequence, and so on in order down to the lowest things, which are more imperfect as they are more remote.<p>If it were not for this supreme perfection in things antecedent and constituent, neither we nor any living creature could arise from seed and then continue in existence. The seeds of trees and shrubs could not sprout and spread, either. The more antecedent a thing is, or the more whole it is, the more immune it is to harm because of its greater perfection. </p>

204. It seems as though prior elements are less perfect than subsequent ones, or simple elements less perfect than composite ones; but the prior elements from which subsequent ones originate, or the simple elements from which composite ones originate, are nevertheless more perfect. The reason is that prior or simple elements are more naked and less covered over with substances and materials devoid of life. They are also, so to speak, more Divine, and consequently nearer to the spiritual sun where the Lord is. For perfection itself resides in the Lord, and thus in the sun which is the first emanation of His Divine love and wisdom. Therefore it exists as well in those subsequent elements which most immediately follow, and so on in order down to the lowest elements, which are less and less perfect the further removed they are.<p>If prior and simple elements did not have in them such surpassing perfection, no person, and no animal either, could be produced from sperm and afterward continue to survive; nor could the seeds of trees and bushes sprout and reproduce their kind. For the more prior any prior element is, and the more simple any simple element is, the more perfect it is, and therefore the more immune to harm. </p>

204. It appears as if prior things must be less perfect than posterior things, that is, simple things than composites. But yet prior things out of which posterior things are formed, or simple things out of which composites are formed, are the more perfect. The reason is that the prior or simpler things are more naked and less covered over with substances and matters devoid of life; and they are, as it were, more divine. Consequently, they are nearer to the spiritual Sun where the Lord is. For perfection itself is in the Lord, and hence in the Sun which is the first proceeding of His Divine Love and Wisdom, and hence in those things which next follow on, and thus in order down to lowest things which are more imperfect as they recede. Unless there were such pre-eminent perfection in prior and simple things, neither man nor any kind of animal could have come into existence from seed, or have afterwards continued to exist. Neither could the seeds of trees and shrubs vegetate and bear fruit. For the more prior anything prior is, and the more simple anything simple is, the more immune it is from destruction, because it is more perfect. </p>

204. It seems as if things prior must be less perfect than things subsequent, that is, things simple than things composite; but things prior out of which things subsequent are formed, that is, things simple out of which things composite are formed, are the more perfect. The reason is that the prior or the simpler are more naked and less covered over with substances and matters devoid of life, and are, as it were, more Divine, consequently nearer to the spiritual sun where the Lord is; for perfection itself is in the Lord, and from Him in that sun which is the first proceeding of His Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, and from that in those things which come immediately after; and thus in order down to things lowest, which are less perfect as they are farther removed. Without such preeminent perfection in things prior and simple, neither man nor any kind of animal could have come into existence from seed, and afterwards continue to exist; nor could the seeds of trees and shrubs vegetate and bear fruit. For the more prior anything prior is, or the more simple anything simple is, the more exempt is it from injury, because it is more perfect. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #204 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
204. Apparet sicut Priora sint minus perfecta quam Posteriora, seu Simplicia quam Composita, sed usque priora ex quibus sunt posteriora, seu simplicia ex quibus sunt composita, perfectiora sunt; causa est, quia priora seu simpliciora sunt nudiora, ac minus obvelata substantiis et materiis vitae expertibus; et sunt sicut Diviniora, quare propiora sunt Soli spirituali, ubi Dominus; ipsa enim Perfectio est in Domino, et inde in Sole, qui est primum Procedens Divini Amoris et Divinae Sapientiae Ipsius; et inde in illis <sup>1</sup>
quae proxime succedunt, et sic ordine usque ad infima, quae sicut distant, imperfectiora sunt. Nisi talis perfectio eminens foret in prioribus et simplicibus, non potuisset homo, nec ullum animal, ex semine existere, et postea subsistere; nec potuissent semina arborum et fruticum vegetari et prolificare: omne enim prius quo prius, et omne simplex quo simplicius, quia est perfectius, est immunius a damnis. <p>
