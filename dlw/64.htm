<h4 align="center"></h4><p>64、从这些和许多其它相似之处(我们在此没有足够篇幅来引用这些相似之处)可以确切地知道，神是一位人，受造宇宙是祂的一个形像。因为正如一切事物与人有一种具体的相似之处，一切事物与神有一种总体的相似之处。</p>

64. We can be quite certain, on the basis of all this and of many other things consistent with it (which it would take too long to include) that God is a person and that the created universe is an image of him. The overall totality offers a reflection of him, just as specific aspects offer reflections of us. </p>

<p>
64. From these and many other parallels - which we do not have the space to cite here - it may be known for a certainty that God is human, and that the created universe is an image of Him. For as all constituents of the created universe exhibit a particular resemblance to the human being, so they exhibit a resemblance overall to Him. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #64 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
64. From these and many other facts in agreement, which there is no space here to cite, it can be known for a certainty that God is Man, and that the created universe is an image of Him. For there is a general relation of all things to Him just as there is a particular relation of all things to man. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #64 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
64. From these and from many other concurring facts which there is not time to adduce now, it may be known with certainty that God is a Man; and that the created universe is an image of Him; for there is a general relation of all things to Him, as well as a particular relation of all things to man. </p>

<p>
64. Ex his et ex multis aliis concordantiis, quas hic non vacat adducere, pro certo potest sciri, quod Deus sit Homo, et quod Universum creatum sit imago Ipsius; relatio enim communis omnium est ad Ipsum, sicut relatio particularis est ad hominem. </p>
