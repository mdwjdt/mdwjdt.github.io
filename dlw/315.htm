<h4 align="center"></h4><p>315、要知道，自然界的热、光和大气对创造的这种形像毫无贡献，这种形像只归因于灵界太阳的热、光和大气。这些事物(即热、光和大气)带有该形像，并给它披上植物界的功用形式。自然界的热、光和大气只是打开种子，将其产物保持在膨胀状态，并给它们披上使其稳固耐久的材料。然而，成就这一切并非靠着它们自己太阳的力量，这些力量本身毫无效果，而是靠着灵界太阳的力量，自然的力量不断被这些力量驱使去提供这些服务。自然界的热、光和大气对赋予这些形式以一种创造的形像毫无贡献，因为创造的形像是属灵的。但为了这种形像能在自然界得以显现并发挥功用，也为了它能保持稳固和耐久，它必须披上物质的形式，也就是说，必须被自然界的物质材料填充。</p>

315. We need to realize that the warmth, light, and atmospheres of the physical world contribute absolutely nothing to this image of creation. This image is entirely the work of the warmth, light, and atmospheres of the spiritual world's sun. These bring the image with them and instill it into the forms of the functions of the plant kingdom. All that the warmth, light, and atmospheres of the physical world do is open the seeds, keep their productivity increasing, and provide the matter that gives them solidity.<p>They do not accomplish this with energies from their own sun, though, which are nothing in their own right. They accomplish it with energies from the spiritual sun that is constantly prompting them to do so. They contribute absolutely nothing to the process of giving the forms an image of creation. The image of creation is spiritual; but in order for it to be visible and to function usefully in a physical world, in order for it to be solid and durable, it needs to be "materialized," or filled in with this world's matter. </p>

315. It should be known that the heat, light and atmospheres of the natural world contribute nothing at all to this image of creation, but that it is attributable solely to the heat, light and atmospheres of the sun of the spiritual world. These carry that image with them and impart it to forms of use belonging to the plant kingdom.<p>The heat, light and atmospheres of the natural world only open seeds, keep their productions in a state of expansion, and induce in them material substances which cause them to endure. However, they accomplish these effects, not in consequence of any forces from their own sun, forces which, regarded in themselves, are powerless, but in consequence of forces from the spiritual sun, by which they are perpetually impelled to these actions. Still, the heat, light and atmospheres of the natural world contribute nothing at all to bestowing on these forms an image of creation. For the image of creation is spiritual. But for this image to be visible and serve a useful purpose in the natural world, and for it to remain fixed and endure, it must assume material form, that is to say, it must be infused with the material substances of that world. </p>

315. It should be known that the heat, light and atmospheres of the natural world contribute absolutely nothing towards this image of creation. It is only the heat, light and atmospheres of the Sun of the spiritual world that do so. These carry that image with them and clothe it with the forms of uses of the vegetable kingdom. The heat, light and atmosphere of the natural world merely open the seeds, hold their products in a state of expansion, and clothe them with matters which give them fixity. But this is done not by forces from their own sun, which viewed in themselves are null, but by forces from the spiritual Sun by which the natural forces are unceasingly impelled towards those services. As to giving them an image of creation, natural forces contribute absolutely nothing, for the image of creation is spiritual. In order, however, that the image may be manifest and perform a use in the natural world, and may stand fixed and be permanent, it must be materialised, that is, filled in with the matters of that world. </p>

315. It should be known that to this image of creation the heat, light, and atmospheres of the natural world contribute nothing whatever. It is only the heat, light, and atmospheres of the sun of the spiritual world that do this, bringing that image with them, and clothing it with the forms of uses of the vegetable kingdom. The heat, light, and atmospheres of the natural world simply open the seeds, keep their products in a state of expansion, and clothe them with the matters that give them fixedness. And this is done not by any forces from their own sun (which viewed in themselves are null), but by forces from the spiritual sun, by which the natural forces are unceasingly impelled to these services. Natural forces contribute nothing whatever towards forming this image of creation, for the image of creation is spiritual. But that this image may be manifest and perform use in the natural world, and may stand fixed and be permanent, it must be materialized, that is, filled in with the matters of that world. </p>

315. Sciendum est, quod calor, lux et athmosphaerae Mundi naturalis prorsus nihil faciant ad imaginem hanc creationis, sed solum calor, lux et athmosphaerae Solis Mundi spiritualis[;] haec secum imaginem illam ferunt, ac illam formis usuum Regni vegetabilis indunt. Calor, lux et athmosphaerae Mundi naturalis solum semina aperiunt, productiones illorum in expansione tenent, et illis inducunt materias, quae figunt illas; sed haec non per vires e suo Sole, quae in se spectatae nullae sunt, sed per vires e Sole spirituali, a quibus perpetuo ad illa aguntur; sed ad dandum illis imaginem creationis, prorsus nihil conferunt: imago enim creationis est spiritualis, sed ut appareat et usum praestet in naturali Mundo, ac ut fixa stet et perduret, erit illa materiata, hoc est, materiis illius Mundi confarta. </p>
