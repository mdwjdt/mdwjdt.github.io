<h4 align="center"></h4><p>347、⑺这两种形式中的每一种在产生时都获得繁殖的方法。地上的一切出产要么属植物界，要么属动物界，如前所述；它们里面都有某种创造的形像，也有某种人类的形像，还有某种无限和永恒的形像；这在前面(313-318节)已经说明。那里还说明，无限和永恒的形像明显表现在它们无限和永恒的繁殖能力上。因此，它们都获得繁殖的方法：动物王国的臣民通过被植入卵或子宫的种子，或通过产卵获得；植物王国的臣民则通过地里的种子获得。由此可见，低等有害的动植物虽通过直接流注起源于地狱，但之后仍间接依靠种子、卵或嫁接来繁殖；所以这一方并不废去另一方。</p>

347. [7.] Whenever it occurs, each form gets the means of propagating its own kind. I explained in <a href="313.htm" target=_top>313-318</a> above that there is some image of creation, some human image--even some image of what is infinite and eternal--in all the things that the earth brings forth, which as noted belong either to the plant or to the animal kingdom. I also noted that this image of the infinite and eternal shines forth in their capacity for infinite and eternal proliferation. This is why they all get means of propagation, members of the animal kingdom by seeds in eggs or the womb or by a discharge, and members of the plant kingdom by seeds in the ground. We can tell from this that even though the incomplete and harmful animals and plants begin from a direct inflow from hell, from then on they are propagated by the means of seeds, eggs, or grafts. The one source, that is, does not rule out the other. </p>

347. (7) Each of these two kinds of forms receives when it comes into existence the means of reproducing. We showed in nos. <a href="313.htm">313-318</a> above that all productions from the earth - which, as we said, belong either to the plant kingdom or to the animal kingdom - have in them some image of creation, and also some image of the human being, and moreover some image of the Infinite and Eternal. We also showed there that an image of the Infinite and Eternal is manifest in them from their ability to reproduce to infinity and to eternity. As a consequence they all receive the means of reproducing - constituents of the animal kingdom through seeds planted in an egg or in a womb, or through live births, and constituents of the plant kingdom through seeds in the ground.<p>It can be seen from this that although the lower and harmful animals and plants arise as a result of an immediate influx from hell, still they reproduce after that by means of seeds, eggs, or offshoot. Consequently the one proposition does not take away the other. </p>

347. (vii) Each of these forms, while it exists, receives the means of propagation. That in all the products of the earth which, as was said above, pertain either to the vegetable or animal kingdom, there is a certain likeness to creation, to man, and also to the Infinite and Eternal, was shown above (Nos. 313-318); also the likeness to the Infinite and Eternal shines out by reason of their capacity for propagation to infinity and eternity. Hence it is that all receive the means of propagation, the subjects of the animal kingdom by seed in the egg, or in the womb, or by spawning; and the subjects of the vegetable kingdom by seed in the earths. From which it can be established that although the more imperfect and noxious animals and vegetables originate by immediate influx out of hell, yet afterwards they are propagated mediately by seeds, eggs, or grafts; consequently, the one position does not annul the other. </p>

347. (7) Each of these forms receives with its existence the means of propagation. In all products of the earth, which pertain, as was said above, either to the vegetable or to the animal kingdom, there is a kind of image of creation, and a kind of image of man, and also a kind of image of the infinite and the eternal; this was shown above (n. <a href="313.htm" target=_top>313-318</a>); also that the image of the infinite and the eternal is clearly manifest in the capacity of all these for infinite and eternal propagation. They all, therefore, receive means of propagation; the subjects of the animal kingdom through seed, in the egg or in the womb or by spawning; and the subjects of the vegetable kingdom through seeds in the ground. From which it can be seen that although the more imperfect and the noxious animals and plants originate through immediate influx out of hell, yet afterwards they are propagated mediately by seeds, eggs, or grafts; consequently, the one position does not annul the other. </p>

347. [VII.] Quod utraque forma, dum existit, propagationis media accipiat. Quod in omnibus productis ex tellure, quae ut dictum est, vel ad Regnum vegetabile vel ad Regnum animale pertinent, sit aliqua imago creationis, tum aliqua imago hominis, et quoque aliqua imago Infiniti ac Aeterni, supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_347/swedenborg_de-divino-amore-et-de-divina-sapientia_313" target=_top>313-318</a>, ostensum est, et quod imago Infiniti et Aeterni eluceat ex eo quod propagari possint in infinitum et in aeternum: inde est quod omnia propagationis media accipiant, subjecta Regni animalis per semina in ovo, vel in utero, vel per egestiones; et subjecta Regni vegetabilis per semina in terris. Ex his constare potest, quod tametsi animalia et vegetabilia imperfectiora et noxia exoriuntur per influxum immediatum ex inferno, usque postea mediate per semina, ova aut traducem propagentur: quare posito uno non tollitur alterum. </p>
