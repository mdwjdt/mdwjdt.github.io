<h4 align="center"></h4><p>96、若留意自己头脑的思维，谁都能看出，属灵之光完全不同于属世之光。因为当头脑思考时，它在光中看见它所思考的对象；作属灵思考的人便看见真理，不管在午夜还是在白昼。因此，光论及理解力，论到理解力，我们会说它看见了。故此，人有时会对别人所说的话回应说，他看到事实的确如此，意思是他明白了或理解了。理解力是属灵的，故无法凭属世之光看见，因为属世之光并非人里面所固有的，而是会随太阳退去。由此可见，理解力所享有的光不同于肉眼的，这光来自另一个源头。</p>

96. If you observe carefully the thoughts of your own mind, you can recognize that there is a spiritual light completely distinct from physical light. When a mind is thinking, it sees its objects in light, and people who think spiritually see truths as readily at midnight as in daytime. This is why we attribute light to our discernment and talk about "seeing." One person may hear what someone else says and say, "I see that this is true," meaning "I understand." Since this understanding is spiritual, it cannot see by physical light. Physical light does not last, but departs with the sun. We can see from this that our discernment enjoys a light other than that of our eyes, and that this light comes from a different source. </p>

96. Anyone may discern that spiritual light is altogether different from natural light if he attends to his mind's thoughts. For when the mind thinks, it sees the objects of its thought in light, and people who think spiritually see truths, and this just as well in the middle of the night as during the day. Therefore light is also predicated of the intellect, and the intellect is said to see. Indeed, in response to the declarations made by some other person, another sometimes says that he sees it to be so, meaning that he understands. Because the intellect is spiritual, it cannot see in this way on account of natural light. For natural light does not last, but departs with the sun.<p>It is apparent from this that the intellect has another light than the eye, and that that light comes from another origin. </p>

<p>
96. Anyone who pays attention to the thoughts of his mind can know that spiritual light is absolutely distinct from natural light. For when the mind thinks, it sees its objects in light, and those who think spiritually see truths, and this at midnight as well as in the daytime. Because of this also light is predicated of the understanding and is said to see. For one sometimes says of matters about which another is speaking, that he sees that it is so, that is, that he understands. The understanding because it is spiritual, cannot see thus from natural light, for natural light does not adhere but passes away with the sun. From this it is clear that the understanding possesses a light other than that of the eye, and that this light is from another source. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #96 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
96. That spiritual light is altogether distinct from natural light, any one may know if he observes the thoughts of his mind. For when the mind thinks, it sees its objects in light, and they who think spiritually see truths, and this at midnight just as well as in the daytime. For this reason light is predicated of the understanding, and the understanding is said to see; thus one sometimes declares of something which another says that he sees (that is, understands) that it is so. The understanding, because it is spiritual, cannot thus see by natural light, for natural light does not inhere in man, but withdraws with the sun. From this it is obvious that the understanding enjoys a light different from that of the eye, and that this light is from a different origin. </p>

<p>
96. Quod Lux spiritualis sit prorsus distincta a Luce naturali, potest quisque scire, si ad mentis suae cogitationes attendit; mens enim cum cogitat, videt objecta sua in luce, et illi qui spiritualiter cogitant, vident vera, et hoc in media nocte aeque bene ut in die; quare etiam de intellectu praedicatur lux, et dicitur videre, nam de illis quae alius loquitur, dicit alter quandoque, quod videat quod ita sit, hoc est, intelligat; intellectus quia est spiritualis, non potest ita videre ex luce naturali; lux enim naturalis non inhaeret, sed abit cum sole: unde patet, quod intellectus gaudeat alia luce, quam oculus; et quod illa lux ex alia origine sit. </p>
