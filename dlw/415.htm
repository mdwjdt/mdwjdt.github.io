<h4 align="center"></h4><p>415、智慧与爱的这种结合与分离，可以看作是肺与心的结合。因为心脏可以通过直接从它输送的血液与支气管的肺泡连接，也可以通过不是直接从它，而是从腔静脉和主动脉输送的血液与它们连接。这使得身体的呼吸与灵的呼吸分离成为可能。但当唯有来自心脏的血液驱动时，两种呼吸就无法分离。由于思维通过对应与呼吸行如一体，所以从肺呼吸的双重模式也明显可知，当与他人在一起时，一个人能以一种方式进行思考，并照着这种思考说话和行动；当不与其他人在一起时，也就是说，当不用担心丧失名声时，则以另一种方式进行思考，并照着这种思考说话和行动。因为这时，他能思想并出言反对神、邻舍和教会的属灵事物，反对道德和文明的法律；他还能通过偷窃、报复、亵渎和通奸等行为反对它们。而另一方面，与其他人在一起，就是在他害怕丧失名声的地方，他能像一个属灵、道德和守法的人那样谈论、说教和行动。由此可见，爱或意愿也能像理解力那样被提升，还能感知诸如出于天堂属于热或爱的那类事物，只要它热爱在同一层级的智慧，若不爱智慧，可以说是能分离的。</p>

415. We can observe this union and separation of wisdom and love virtually imaged in the way the lungs are connected to the heart. The heart can be connected with the clustered little bronchial bladders by blood that comes directly from itself and also by blood that comes not from itself but from the vena cava and aorta. This makes it possible for our physical breathing to be independent of our spiritual breathing; though if the blood is coming only from the heart, the two forms of breathing cannot be separated.<p>Next, since our thoughts act in unison with our breathing because of their correspondence, we can also see from the double nature of the lungs' breathing that we can think one way and speak and act out our thoughts one way when we are with other people, while when we are by ourselves--that is, when we have no fear of damage to our reputation--we think another way and speak and act out our thoughts another way. Then we can both think and say things against God, the neighbor, the spiritual values of the church, and moral and civic values. We can act against these as well by deeds of theft, revenge, blasphemy, and adultery. All the while, when we are in public where we risk loss of reputation, we can talk, preach, and behave exactly as though we were spiritual, moral, and civic individuals.<p>We can tell from this that love or volition, like discernment, can be lifted up so as to receive things proper to the warmth or love of heaven provided only that it loves wisdom to that degree; while if it does not love it, they can part company. </p>

415. This conjunction and disjunction of wisdom and love can be seen as though imaged in the conjunction of the lungs with the heart. For the heart can be joined to the clustered air sacs of the bronchia in consequence of the blood transmitted from it directly, and it can be joined to them in consequence of the blood transmitted not from it directly but from the vena cava and aorta. This makes it possible for the respiration of the body to be separated from the respiration of the spirit. But when only the blood from the heart impels, then the two respirations cannot be separated.<p>Now because thoughts are united by correspondence with the processes of respiration, it is apparent also from the twofold mode of the lungs in breathing that a person can think and in accordance with the thought speak and act in one way when in company with others, and think and in accordance with the thought speak and act in another way when he is not in their company, namely, when he does not fear any loss of reputation. For he can then think and speak in opposition to God, to the neighbor, to the spiritual concerns of the church, and to moral and civil concerns, and can also act in opposition to them by stealing, taking revenge, blaspheming, and committing adultery. On the other hand, in gatherings where he fears a loss of reputation, he can speak, preach and act altogether like a spiritual, moral and law-abiding person.<p>It can be seen from this that love or the will can, similarly to the intellect, be elevated, and can admit such matters as are matters of the warmth or love of heaven, provided it loves wisdom in the same degree; and that if it does not love it, it can be as though separated. </p>

415. This conjunction and disjunction of wisdom and love may be seen imaged as it were, in the conjunction of the lungs with the heart. For the heart can be joined to the clustering air-vessels of the bronchia by blood sent out from itself, and by blood not from itself but from the vena cava and aorta. By this means the breathing of the body can be separated from the breathing of the spirit; but when blood from the heart alone acts, the respirations cannot be separated. Now since thoughts act in unison with breathing by correspondence, it is plain from the twofold condition of the lungs in respect of breathing, that man can think in one way and from his thought speak and act in the company of others, and that he can think in another way and from his thought speak and act when not in company, that is, when he fears no loss of reputation. For then he can think and speak against God, the neighbour, the spiritual things of the Church, and against moral and civil things; and moreover, can act against them, by stealing, taking revenge, blaspheming, and committing adultery. But in company when he fears loss of reputation, he can talk, preach, and act precisely like a spiritual, moral, and civil man. From these things it can be established that love or the will, just the same as the understanding, can be elevated and receive those things that are of the heat or love of heaven, provided that it loves wisdom in that degree, and if it does not love wisdom, that it can, as it were, be separated. </p>

415. This conjunction and disjunction of wisdom and love can be seen effigied, as it were, in the conjunction of the lungs with the heart. For the heart can be conjoined to the clustering vesicles of the bronchia by blood sent out from itself, and also by blood sent out not from itself but from the vena cava and the aorta. Thereby the respiration of the body can be separated from the respiration of the spirit; but when blood from the heart alone acts the respirations cannot be separated. Now since thoughts act as one with respirations by correspondence it is plain, from the twofold state of the lungs in respirations, that man is able to think and from thoughts to speak and act in one way when in company with others, and to think and from thought to speak and act in another way when not in company, that is, when he has no fear of loss of reputation; for he can then think and speak against God, the neighbor, the spiritual things of the church, and against moral and civil laws; and he can also act contrary to them, by stealing, by being revengeful, by blaspheming, by committing adultery. But in company with others, where he is afraid of losing reputation, he can talk, preach and act precisely like a spiritual, moral and civil man. From all this it can be seen that love or the will as well as the understanding can be elevated and can receive such things as are of the heat or love of heaven, provided it loves wisdom in that degree, and if it does not love wisdom, that it can as it were be separated. </p>

415. Haec conjunctio et disjunctio sapientiae et amoris in pulmonis conjunctione cum corde quasi effigiata spectari potest; cor enim <sup>1</sup>
potest ex sanguine a se emisso conjungi vesiculis racemosis bronchiorum, et potest ex sanguine non a se sed a vena cava et aorta; per hoc potest respiratio corporis separari a respiratione spiritus; <sup>2</sup>
at cum sanguis solum a corde agit, tunc non possunt respirationes separari; nunc quia cogitationes unum agunt cum respirationibus <sup>3</sup>
per correspondentiam, patet etiam ex duplici pulmonis statu quoad respirationem, quod homo possit aliter cogitare <sup>4</sup>
et ex cogitatione loqui et agere in consortio cum aliis, ac aliter cogitare et ex cogitatione loqui et agere cum non in consortio est, hoc est, cum non timet aliquam jacturam famae, tunc enim potest cogitare et loqui contra Deum, proximum, spiritualia Ecclesiae, et contra moralia et civilia, <sup>5</sup>
et quoque agere contra illa, furando, vindicando, blasphemando, adulterando; at in consortiis ubi timet jacturam famae potest loqui, praedicare et agere prorsus sicut homo spiritualis, moralis et civilis. Ex his constare potest, quod amor seu voluntas possit similiter ac intellectus, elevari ac recipere illa quae caloris seu amoris coeli sunt, modo amet sapientiam in eo gradu; et si non amat illam, quod possit sicut separari. <p>
