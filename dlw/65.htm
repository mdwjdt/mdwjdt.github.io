65. The useful functions of everything created tend upward, step by step, from the lowest to us, and through us to God the Creator, their source. As already stated [<a href="52.htm" target=_top>52</a>], these "lowest things" are all the elements of the mineral kingdom--various forms of matter, some stony substances, some saline, some oily, some mineral, some metallic, with the constant addition of a humus composed of plant and animal matter reduced to minute particles. Here lie hidden the goal and the beginning of all the functions that arise from life. The goal of all useful functions is the effort to produce [more] functions; the beginning of all functions is an active force that comes out of that effort. These are characteristics of the mineral kingdom.<p>The intermediate things are all the elements of the plant kingdom--grasses and herbs of all kinds, plants and shrubs of all kinds, and trees of all kinds. Their functions are in support of everything in the animal kingdom, whether flawed or flawless. They provide food, pleasure, and life. They nourish [animal] bodies with their substance, they delight them with their taste and fragrance and beauty, and they enliven their desires. This effort is inherent in them from their life.<p>The primary things are all the members of the animal kingdom. The lowest of these are called worms and insects, the intermediate ones birds and animals, and the highest humans; for there are lowest, intermediate, and highest things in each kingdom. The lowest are for the service of the intermediate and the intermediate for the service of the highest. So the useful functions of all created things tend upwards in a sequence from the lowest to the human, which is primary in the divine design. </p>

<p>65. The uses of all things that have been created ascend by degrees from the lowest created forms to mankind, and through mankind to God the Creator from whom they originate. The lowest created forms are, as we said above, each and every constituent of the mineral kingdom, which are substances of various kinds, composed of stony, saline, oily, mineral and metallic materials, and covered with soil resulting from plant and animal matter disintegrating into a fine dust. In these lie the end in all uses that originate from life, and also their beginning. The end in all uses is the endeavor to effect them, and their beginning is the force acting as a result of that endeavor. These are the end in and the beginning of the uses of the mineral kingdom.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Intermediate created forms are each and every constituent of the plant kingdom. These are grasses and herbs of every kind, shrubs and bushes of every kind, and trees of every kind. Their uses exist to serve each and every constituent of the animal kingdom, both the lower ones and the higher. They nourish these, gratify them, and enliven them. They nourish their bodies with their substances, gratify their senses with their taste, smell and beauty, and enliven their affections. An endeavor to serve in these ways is present in them also from life.<p> </p>
<p>[3] The highest created forms are each and every constituent of the animal kingdom. The lowest forms in it are called worms and insects, the intermediate ones birds and beasts, and the highest ones human beings. For every kingdom has in it its lowest, intermediate, and highest constituents, the lowest existing to serve the intermediate, and the intermediate existing to serve the highest.<p>Thus do the uses of all things that have been created ascend in turn from the lowest created forms to mankind, which is the highest in order. </p>

<p>65. THE USES OF ALL CREATED THINGS ASCEND BY DEGREES FROM LOWEST THINGS TO MAN, AND THROUGH MAN TO GOD THE CREATOR FROM WHOM THEY ARE <p>Lowest things, as was stated above, are each and all things of the mineral kingdom which are matters of various kinds, of a stony, saline, oily, mineral or metallic substance covered over with soil from vegetable and animal matters broken up into the most minute tilth. In these lie concealed both the end and the beginning of all uses which are derived from life. The end of all uses is the endeavour to produce uses, the beginning is the force acting from that endeavour. These belong to the mineral kingdom. <p>Middle things are each and all things of the vegetable kingdom, which are grasses and herbs of every kind, plants and shrubs of every kind and trees of every kind. The uses of these are for each and all things of the animal kingdom, both imperfect and perfect. These they nourish, delight and vivify. They nourish their bodies with their own matters, delight their senses with taste, fragrance and beauty, and enliven their affections. The endeavour towards this is also in these from life. <p>First things are each and all things of the animal kingdom. The lowest there are called worms and insects, the middle are birds and beasts, and the highest, men. For in each kingdom are the lowest, the middle and highest, the lowest for the use of the middle, and the middle for the use of the highest. Thus the uses of all created things ascend in order from lowest things to man who is first in order. </p>

65. THE USES OF ALL CREATED THINGS ASCEND BY DEGREES FROM LAST THINGS TO MAN, AND THROUGH MAN TO GOD THE CREATOR, FROM WHOM THEY ARE. <p>Last things, as was said above, are each and all things of the mineral kingdom, which are materials of various kinds, of a stony, saline, oily, mineral, or metallic nature, covered over with soil formed of vegetable and animal matters reduced to the finest dust. In these lie concealed both the end and the beginning of all uses which are from life. The end of all uses is the endeavor to produce uses, and the beginning is the acting force from that endeavor. These pertain to the mineral kingdom. Middle things are each and all things of the vegetable kingdom, such as grasses and herbs of every kind, plants and shrubs of every kind, and trees of every kind. The uses of these are for the service of each and all things of the animal kingdom, both imperfect and perfect. These they nourish, delight, and vivify; nourishing the bellies of animals with their vegetable substances, delighting the animal senses with taste, fragrance, and beauty, and vivifying their affections. The endeavor towards this is in these also from life. First things are each and all things of the animal kingdom. Those are lowest therein which are called worms and insects, the middle are birds and beasts, and the highest, men; for in each kingdom there are lowest, middle and highest things, the lowest for the use of the middle, and the middle for the use of the highest. Thus the uses of all created things ascend in order from outmost things to man, who is first in order. </p>

<p>65. QUOD USUS OMNIUM QUAE CREATA SUNT, ASCENDANT PER GRADUS AB ULTIMIS AD HOMINEM, ET PER HOMINEM AD DEUM CREATOREM, A QUO. ULTIMA sunt, ut supra dictum est, omnia et singula Regni mineralis, quae sunt materiae varii generis, ex substantia lapidea, salina, oleosa, minerali, metallica, superinducta humo ex vegetabili et animali in minutissimum pollinem fatiscentibus constante; in his latet omnium usuum, qui ex vita sunt, finis et quoque principium; finis omnium usuum est conatus producendi illos, ac principium est vis agens ex illo conatu; haec sunt Regni mineralis.
<p> </p>
<p>[2] MEDIA sunt omnia et singula Regni vegetabilis; quae sunt gramina et herbae omnis generis, plantae et virgulta omnis generis, et arbores omnis generis; horum usus sunt pro omnibus et singulis Regni animalis, tam imperfectis quam perfectis; nutriunt illa, delectant illa, et vivificant illa; nutriunt corpora eorum materiis suis, delectant sensus eorum sapore, odore, pulchritudine, et vivificant affectiones eorum: conatus ad illa etiam inest illis a vita.<p> </p>
<p>[3] PRIMA sunt omnia et singula Regni animalis; infima ibi vocantur <sup>1</sup>
vermes et insecta, media volucres et bestiae, ac suprema homines; nam in omni Regno sunt infima, media, et suprema, infima pro usu mediorum, et media pro usu supremorum: ita ordine ascendunt usus omnium quae creata sunt ab ultimis ad hominem, qui primus in ordine est. <p>
