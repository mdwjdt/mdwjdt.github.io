<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第175节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>175、属灵大气和属世大气之间的区别在于：属灵大气是神性之火和神性之光的容器，因而是爱和智慧的容器，因为它们从内在将这些包含在自己里面；属世大气也是容器，但不是神性之火和神性之光的容器，而是它们自己的太阳之火和光的容器；它们自己的太阳本身是死的，如前所示。因此，属世大气里面丝毫没有来自灵界太阳的东西，尽管它们被源于灵界太阳的属灵大气包围。这就是属灵大气和属世大气之间的区别，这一点是从天使的智慧那里获知的。</p>

<p>
175. The difference between spiritual atmospheres and physical atmospheres is that spiritual atmospheres are vessels of divine fire and light, of love and wisdom, then. They bear these things within themselves. Physical atmospheres, though, are not vessels of divine fire and light; they are vessels of the fire and light of their own sun, which is intrinsically dead, as explained above [89, 157-159]. As a result, there is nothing from the spiritual world's sun within them. However, they are surrounded by the spiritual atmospheres that come from that sun.<p>This differentiation between spiritual atmospheres and physical atmospheres is a matter of angelic wisdom. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #175 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
175. The difference between spiritual atmospheres and natural atmospheres is that spiritual atmospheres are vehicles of Divine fire and light, thus of love and wisdom, for they contain these within them, whereas natural atmospheres are not vehicles of Divine fire and light but are vehicles of the fire and light of their sun, a sun which in itself is, as we showed above, lifeless. Consequently natural atmospheres do not have in them anything from the sun of the spiritual world, although they are surrounded by spiritual atmospheres which originate from that sun.<p>That this is the difference between spiritual atmospheres and natural atmospheres comes from angelic wisdom. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #175 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
175. The difference between spiritual and natural atmospheres is this, that spiritual atmospheres are receptacles of Divine fire and Divine light, thus of love and wisdom, for they contain these within themselves, while natural atmospheres are not receptacles of Divine fire and Divine light, but they are receptacles of the fire and light of their own sun, which in itself is dead, as has been shown above. Consequently there is nothing interiorly within them from the Sun of the spiritual world, although they are surrounded by the spiritual atmospheres which are from that Sun. That this is the difference between spiritual and natural atmospheres has been learned from angelic wisdom. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #175 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
175. The difference between spiritual and natural atmospheres is that spiritual atmospheres are receptacles of Divine fire and Divine light, thus of love and wisdom, for they contain these interiorly within them; while natural atmospheres are receptacles, not of Divine fire and Divine light, but of the fire and light of their own sun, which in itself is dead, as was shown above; consequently there is nothing interiorly in them from the sun of the spiritual world, although they are environed by spiritual atmospheres from that sun. That this is the difference between spiritual and natural atmospheres has been learned from the wisdom of angels. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #175 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
175. Differentia inter Athmosphaeras spirituales et inter Athmosphaeras naturales est, quod Athmosphaerae spirituales sint receptacula Divini ignis et Divinae lucis, ita Amoris et Sapientiae, intus enim in se illa continent: ast Athmosphaerae naturales non sunt receptacula Divini ignis et Divinae lucis, sed sunt receptacula ignis et lucis sui Solis, qui in se est mortuus, ut supra ostensum est, quare intus in illis non est aliquid ex Sole Mundi spiritualis, sed usque ambiuntur ab athmosphaeris spiritualibus quae ex illo Sole sunt. Quod haec differentia sit inter Athmosphaeras spirituales et inter Athmosphaeras naturales est ex Sapientia Angelica. </p>
