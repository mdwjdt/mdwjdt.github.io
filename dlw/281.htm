<h4 align="center"></h4><p>281、由此得出以下结论：对于一个属世心智通过三个层级降至地狱的人来说，他的一切邪恶和虚假都包含在他的行为中；而对于一个属世心智升至天堂的人来说，他的一切良善和真理也都包含在他的行为中；天使仅仅从人的言语或行为就能感知到这二者。正因如此，在圣言中，经上说，人“必照他的行为受审判”，“他必句句供出来”。</p>

281. This leads to the conclusion that the deeds of people whose earthly minds are going down to hell by three levels contain everything they have that is evil and therefore false, and that the deeds of people whose earthly minds are moving up into heaven contain everything they have that is good and true, and also that angels perceive both simply from what we say and do. This is why it says in the Word that we are to be judged according to our works and that we will have to give an account of our words. </p>

281. We conclude from this that in the works of a person whose natural mind descends through three degrees into hell are contained all his evils and falsities, and that in the works of a person whose natural mind ascends into heaven are contained all his goods and truths, and that both the one and the other are perceived by angels simply from the person's speech or action.<p>It is because of this that we are told in the Word that a person will be judged according to his works, <sup>1</sup>
and that he will give an account of his words. <sup>2</sup>

281. From these facts it is concluded that, in the deeds of a man whose natural mind descends through three degrees into hell, there are all his evils and falsities of evil, and that, in the deeds of a man whose natural mind ascends into heaven, there are all his goods and truths, and that both are perceived by the angels from the mere speech and act of a man. Hence it is that it is said in the Word that a man is to be judged according to his works and that he shall render an account of his words. </p>

281. Ex his concluditur, quod in operibus hominis, cujus Mens naturalis per tres gradus descendit in infernum, sint omnia mala et falsa mali ejus; et quod in operibus hominis, cujus Mens naturalis in Coelum ascendit, sint omnia bona et vera ejus, et quod haec et illa percipiantur ab Angelis ex sola loquela et ex sola actione hominis. Inde est, quod in Verbo dicatur, quod homo secundum opera sua judicandus sit; et quod rationem vocum suarum redditurus sit. </p>
