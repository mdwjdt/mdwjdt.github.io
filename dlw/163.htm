<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第163节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">2.16 没有一生一死这两个太阳，创造是不可能的</h4><p>163、宇宙总体上分为两个世界，即灵界和自然界。天使和灵人住在灵界，世人住在自然界。这两个世界表面上完全相同，以至于无法区分；但内在完全不同。如前所述，住在灵界的人被称为天使和灵人；他们本身是属灵的，并且因是属灵的，所以作属灵的思考和属灵的言谈。相反，住在自然界的人是属世的，所以作属世的思考和属世的言谈。属灵的思维、言语和属世的思维、言语毫无共同之处。由此明显可知，这两个世界，即灵界和自然界彼此完全不同，以致它们无论如何都不能混在一起。</p>

163. There would be no creation if it were not for this pair of suns, one living and one dead. Generally speaking, the universe is divided into two worlds, a spiritual one and a physical one. Angels and spirits are in the spiritual world, and we are in the physical world. These two worlds are exactly alike in outward appearance, so much alike that there is no way to tell them apart; but as to inner appearance, they are completely different. The very people who are in the spiritual world (who are called angels and spirits, as I have just said) are spiritual beings; and since they are spiritual beings, they think spiritually and talk spiritually. On the other hand, we who are in the physical world are physical, so we think physically and talk physically. Spiritual thought and speech and physical thought and speech have nothing in common. We can see from this that the two worlds, the spiritual one and the physical one, are completely distinct from each other, so much so that there is no way for them to be in the same place. </p>

163. Without the two suns, one alive and the other lifeless, creation would not exist. The universe is divided in general into two worlds, one spiritual and one natural. Inhabiting the spiritual world are angels and spirits. Inhabiting the natural world are people.<p>These two worlds are totally alike in their outward aspect - so alike that they cannot be distinguished - but in their inward aspect they are entirely unalike. The people who inhabit the spiritual world - who, as we said, are called angels and spirits - are themselves spiritual, and because they are spiritual, they think spiritually and speak spiritually. In contrast, people who inhabit the natural world are natural, and therefore they think naturally and speak naturally; and spiritual thought and speech have nothing in common with natural thought and speech.<p>It is apparent from this that these two worlds, one spiritual and one natural, are entirely distinct from each other, so distinct that they cannot in any way blend together. </p>

163. WITHOUT TWO SUNS, THE ONE LIVING AND THE OTHER DEAD, CREATION IS NOT POSSIBLE <p>The universe in general is divided into two worlds, the spiritual and the natural. In the spiritual world are angels and spirits. In the natural world are men. These two worlds are entirely alike as to the external appearance, so alike that they cannot be distinguished; but as to internal appearance they are entirely unlike. The men themselves in the spiritual world, who, as said above, are called angels and spirits are spiritual. And because they are spiritual, they think spiritually and they speak spiritually. But men who are in the natural world are natural, and therefore they think naturally and speak naturally. And spiritual thought and speech have nothing in common with natural thought and speech. From this it is plain that these two worlds, the spiritual and the natural, are entirely distinct from each other, so that in no way can they be together. </p>

163. WITHOUT A DOUBLE SUN, ONE LIVING AND THE OTHER DEAD, NO CREATION IS POSSIBLE. <p>The universe in general is divided into two worlds, the spiritual and the natural. In the spiritual world are angels and spirits, in the natural world men. In external appearance these two worlds are entirely alike, so alike that they cannot be distinguished; but as to internal appearance they are entirely unlike. The men themselves in the spiritual world, who (as was said above) are called angels and spirits, are spiritual, and, being spiritual, they think spiritually and speak spiritually. But the men of the natural world are natural, and therefore think naturally and speak naturally; and spiritual thought and speech have nothing in common with natural thought and speech. From this it is plain that these two worlds, the spiritual and the natural, are entirely distinct from each other, so that they can in no respect be together. </p>

163. QUOD ABSQUE BINO SOLE, UNO VIVO ET ALTERO MORTUO, NON DETUR CREATIO. Universum in genere distinctum est in duos Mundos, Spiritualem et Naturalem; in Mundo spirituali sunt Angeli et Spiritus; in Mundo naturali sunt Homines: duo illi Mundi prorsus similes quoad externam faciem sunt, ita similes ut non distingui possint, at quoad internam faciem prorsus dissimiles sunt; ipsi homines qui in Mundo spirituali sunt, qui ut dictum est, vocantur Angeli et Spiritus, sunt spirituales, et quia spirituales sunt, spiritualiter cogitant et spiritualiter loquuntur; at homines qui in naturali Mundo sunt, naturales sunt, et ideo naturaliter cogitant et naturaliter loquuntur, ac cogitatio et loquela spiritualis cum cogitatione et loquela naturali nihil commune habet. Ex eo patet, quod duo illi Mundi, spiritualis et naturalis, inter se prorsus distincti sint, adeo ut nullo modo simul esse possint. </p>
