<h4 align="center"></h4><p>220、由于整体，或身体的能力主要集中于手臂和手，它们是身体的末端，所以在圣言中，“手臂或膀臂”和“手”表示能力，“右手”表示更超强的能力。这就是各层级进入能力状态的演变和发出，故与人同在，并对应于其一切成分的天使，仅从手的动作就能知道人在其理解力和意愿，以及仁和信，因而属其心智的内在生命和由此而来的身体外在生命方面是什么样子。<br><br>我常常惊讶于天使仅从身体通过手的活动就能获得这样的认识；但这一事实已反复通过活生生的经历向我证明。我还被告知，正因如此，举行就职典礼时要按手，并且“用手触摸”表示交流，等等。我由此得出结论：仁和信的一切都存在于行为中，没有行为的仁和信就像太阳周围逐渐消失或被云驱散的光晕。这就是为何圣言如此频繁地提及“行为”和“作工”；经上说，人得救取决于它们。此外，行出来的人被称为智慧的人，没有行出来的人被称为愚蠢的人。<br><br>然而，要记住，这里的“行为”是指实际行出来的功用。因为仁与信的一切都存在于功用，并取决于功用。行为与功用之所以具有这种对应关系，是因为对应是属灵的，但通过作为其容器的物质、材料来实现。</p>

220. Since the whole being or body focuses its powers primarily in the arms and hands, which are the extremities, arms and hands in the Word mean power, with the right hand meaning the greater power. Since this is how the levels unfold and express themselves in power, the angels who are with us and are sensitive to everything in us can tell simply from a single action of our hand what we are like in discernment and intent, in charity and faith, and therefore in the inner life of our minds and the outer life in our bodies, which comes from the inner life.<p>I have often been astounded by the kind of recognition angels have simply from the physical action of a hand, but it has been shown to me often enough and by personal experience. I have also been told that this is why induction into ministry is done by the laying on of hands and why touching with the hand means sharing, among other things. This leads to the conclusion that the whole of charity and faith is in works and that charity and faith without works are like halos around the sun that dissipate and vanish when a cloud passes by. So time after time the Word talks about works and doing and says that our salvation depends on such things. Then too, the one who does something is called wise and the one who does not is called foolish.<p>We should realize, though, that "works" means deeds of service that are put into action. The whole of charity and faith is in them and depends on them. The correspondence is with acts of service because while the correspondence is spiritual, it happens through the substances and materials that are its subjects. </p>

<p>220. Since the whole organism or body directs its powers principally into the arms and hands, which are its extremities, therefore arms and hands in the Word symbolize power, and the right hand a superior power.<p>Since the evolution and emergence of degrees into a state of power is as stated, therefore the angels who are present with a person and in correspondence with all his constituents know merely from any action done through the hands what the person is like in regard to his intellect and will, and so in regard to his charity and faith, thus in regard to the inner life which is the life of his mind, and in regard to the outward life which results from that in the body.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Such a recognition gained by angels simply from the action of the body through the hands has often astonished me, but I have nevertheless had it shown me a number of times through personal experience. I have also been told that it is for this reason that inaugurations into the ministry are performed by the laying on of hands, and that to touch with the hand symbolically means to communicate, in addition to many other like things.<p>I have concluded from this that everything pertaining to charity and faith exists in works, and that charity and faith without works are like halos around the sun which fade or are dispelled by a cloud. That is why the Word so often mentions works and tells us to do them, saying that a person's salvation depends on them. Moreover, the person who does them is called wise, while the person who does not do them is called foolish. <sup>1</sup>
<p> </p>
<p>[3] One should know, however, that by works here are meant useful services which are actually done. For it is in these and in accordance with these that everything pertaining to charity and faith exists. Charity and faith have this correspondence with useful services, because although their correspondence is a spiritual one, it is effected by means of substances and materials which are its vessels.<p>

<p>220. Since the whole, that is, the body has fixed its powers chiefly in the arms and hands which are ultimates, therefore by "arms" and "hands" in the Word is signified power, and by the "right hand" superior power. Since such is the evolution and putting forth of degrees into power, therefore from action alone which is made with the hands, the angels who are with a man, and in the correspondence of all things belonging to him, know his quality as to understanding and will, also as to charity and faith, thus as to the internal life belonging to his mind and the external life derived therefrom in the body. I have often wondered that the angels have such knowledge from the mere action of the body through the hands, but yet it has been shown several times by living experience. And it has been said that it is from this that ordinations into the ministry are performed by the laying on of hands and that by touching with the hand is signified communicating, besides other similar things. From these things the conclusion is formed that everything of charity and faith is in works, and that charity and faith without works are like rainbows around the sun, which vanish away and are lost in the cloud. Because of this, "works" are so often mentioned in the Word and it is said [we are] "to do" them, and that a man's salvation depends upon these. Also he that doeth is called wise, and he that doeth not, foolish. But it ought to be known that by "works" here are understood uses which are actually done, for in these and according to them is everything of charity and faith. There is this correspondence [of works] with uses, because this correspondence is spiritual, but it is carried out through substances and matters which are subjects. </p>

220. Since the powers of the whole, that is, of the body, are determined chiefly into the arms and hands, which are outmosts, "arms" and "hands," in the Word, signify power, and the "right hand" signifies superior power. And such being the evolution and putting forth of degrees into power, the angels that are with man and in correspondence with all things belonging to him, know merely from such action as is effected through the hands, what a man is in respect to his understanding and will, also his charity and faith, thus in respect to the internal life pertaining to his mind and the external life derived therefrom in the body. I have often wondered that the angels have such knowledge from the mere action of the body through the hands; but that it is so has been shown to me repeatedly by living experience, and it has been said that it is from this that inductions into the ministry are performed by the laying on of the hands, and that "touching with the hand" signifies communicating, with other like things. From all this the conclusion is formed, that the all of charity and faith is in works, and that charity and faith without works are like rainbows about the sun, which vanish away and are dispersed by a cloud. On this account "works" and "doing works" are so often mentioned in the Word, and it is said that a man's salvation depends upon these; moreover, he that doeth is called a wise man, and he that doeth not is called a foolish man. But it should be remembered that by "works" here are meant uses actually done; for the all of charity and faith is in uses and according to uses. There is this correspondence of works with uses, because the correspondence is spiritual, but it is carried out through substances and matters, which are subjects. </p>

<p>220. Quoniam totum seu corpus determinavit suas potentias praecipue in brachia et manus, quae sunt ultima, ideo per brachia et manus in Verbo significatur potentia, ac per dextram potentia superior. Quoniam talis est evolutio et exsertio graduum in potentiam, ideo ex sola actione, quae fit per manus, ab Angelis, qui apud hominem sunt, et in correspondentia omnium ejus, noscitur qualis homo est quoad intellectum et voluntatem, tum quoad charitatem et fidem, ita quoad vitam internam quae mentis ejus est, et quoad vitam externam quae ex illa in corpore est.<p> </p>
<p>[2] Quod talis cognitio Angelis sit ex sola actione corporis per manus, saepius miratus sum, sed usque per vivam experientiam aliquoties <sup>1</sup>
ostensum est, et dictum quod inde sit quod inaugurationes in ministerium fiant per impositionem manuum, et quod per tangere manu significetur communicare, praeter alia similia. Ex his conclusum factum est, quod omne charitatis et fidei in operibus sit, et quod charitas et fides absque operibus sint sicut irides circum solem, quae evanescunt et a nube dissipantur; quare toties in Verbo dicuntur opera, et dicitur facere, et quod salus hominis ab illis pendeat; etiam qui facit vocatur sapiens, et qui non facit vocatur	stultus.<p> </p>
<p>[3] At sciendum est, quod per opera hic intelligantur usus, qui actualiter fiunt; in illis enim et secundum illos est omne charitatis et fidei; cum usibus est illa correspondentia, quia correspondentia illa est spiritualis, sed fit per substantias et materias, quae sunt subjecta. <p>
