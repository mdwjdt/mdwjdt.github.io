<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第280节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>280、人的言语也是如此。天使从一个人说话的语气就知道他的爱，从发音吐字知道他的智慧，从话语的含义知道他的知识。此外，他们声称，这三者就在每一句话里面，因为一句话就是一种容器，里面包含了语气、发音和含义。第三层天堂的天使告诉我，他们能从一个人在交谈时所说的每一句话中感知到他的心智的总体状态，同时还能感知到他的某些具体状态。圣言的每一句话都包含了与神性智慧有关的某种属灵事物，以及与神性之爱有关的某种属天事物；当世人虔诚阅读圣言时，这些事物就被天使感知到，这一点在《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》的许多地方都有说明。</p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #280 (Dole (2003))</h4>
<p>
280. It is the same with our speech. Angels recognize our love from the sound of our speech, our wisdom from the way the sound is articulated, and our knowledge from the meaning of the words. They also tell me that these three elements are in every word, because a word is like a realization that has the sound, the articulation, and the meaning within it. Angels of the third heaven have told me that they sense from any word a speaker says in a sentence the general state of that individual's mind, and some specific states as well.<p>I have explained at some length in Teachings for the New Jerusalem on Sacred Scripture that in the individual words of Scripture there is something spiritual that expresses divine wisdom and something heavenly that expresses divine love, and that angels are aware of these when someone is reading the Word devoutly. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #280 (Rogers (1999))</h4>
<p>
280. The same is the case with a person's speech. From the sound of his speech angels discern a person's love, from the articulation of the sound his wisdom, and from the sense of the words his knowledge. Moreover they say that these three elements are discerned in every single word, because a word is a kind of containing vessel, having in it sound, articulation, and meaning.<p>I have been told by angels of the third heaven that they perceive from each of a speaker's words in sequence his general state of mind and at the same time some of his particular states.<p>Every single expression in the Word contains some spiritual element relating to Divine wisdom and some celestial element relating to Divine love, and these are perceived by angels when a person reads the Word with reverence, as we showed in many places in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #280 (Harley and Harley (1969))</h4>
<p>
280. It is the same with man's speech. The angels know a man love from the sound of his speech, they know his wisdom from the articulation of the sound, and they know his knowledge from the sense of the words. Furthermore they say that these three are in every word, for the word is a kind of resultant, there being within it sound, articulation and sense. It has been told me by angels of the third heaven that, from each successive word which a man speaks, they perceive the general state of his disposition (animus), and also some particular states. They said that in each single word of the Word there is a spiritual [sense] from the Divine wisdom, and a celestial which is of the Divine love, and [the fact] that these are perceived by the angels when the Word is devoutly read by man has been abundantly shown in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #280 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
280. It is the same with man's speech. The angels recognize a man's love from his tone in speaking, his wisdom from his articulation, and his knowledge from the meaning of the words. They declare, moreover, that these three are in every word, because the word is a kind of resultant, involving tone, articulation, and meaning. It was told me by angels of the third heaven that from each successive word that a man speaks in discourse they perceive the general state of his disposition, and also some particular states. That in each single word of the Word there is something spiritual from the Divine wisdom, and something celestial from the Divine love; and that these are perceived by angels when the Word is devoutly read by man, has been abundantly shown in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Concerning the Sacred Scripture. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #280 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
280. Simile est cum loquela hominis; Angeli ex sono loquelae noscunt amorem hominis, ex articulatione soni sapientiam ejus, et ex sensu vocum scientiam ejus: et amplius dicunt, quod illa tria in unaquavis voce sint, quia vox est sicut conclusum, est enim inibi sonus, articulatio, et sensus. Ab Angelis tertii Coeli mihi dictum est, quod ex quavis voce loquentis in serie, percipiant statum animi ejus communem, et quoque aliquos status particulares. Quod in singulis vocibus Verbi sit <sup>1</sup>
spirituale, quod est Divinae sapientiae, ac Coeleste quod est Divini amoris, et quod illa percipiantur ab Angelis, cum Verbum sancte legitur ab homine, in DOCTRINA NOVAE HIEROSOLYMAE DE SCRIPTURA SACRA, multis ostensum est. <p>
