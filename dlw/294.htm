<h4 align="center"></h4><p>294、那些构成灵界太阳的事物来自主，但不是主，故本身不是生命，而是本身缺乏生命；就像那些从天使或世人流出，并构成环绕他的气场的事物不是这个天使或世人，而是来自他，并且没有他的生命。这些气场只有在一致的情况下才与天使或世人构成一体，因为它们源于其身体的形式，这些形式本身是其生命的形式。这是一个奥秘，天使以其属灵观念能在思维中看到它，还能用语言来表达，但世人以其属世观念却不能，因为一千个属灵观念构成一个属世观念，而世人却无法将一个属世观念分解成任意一个属灵观念，更别说分解成许多个属灵观念了。原因在于，这些观念因高度层级的不同而不同，如第三部分所解释的。</p>

294. Since the elements that make up the sun of the spiritual world are from the Lord and are not the Lord, they are not intrinsic life but are devoid of intrinsic life. In the same way, the elements that flow out from angels and from us and form surrounding auras are not the angels or the people. They are derived from them but are devoid of their life. They are part of the angel or person only in the fact that they are in harmony with them because they are derived from those forms of their bodies that are forms of the life within them.<p>This is a mystery that angels can see in thought and express in speech with their spiritual concepts, while we cannot do the same with our earthly concepts. This is because a thousand spiritual concepts go to make up one earthly one, and we cannot resolve a single earthly concept into any spiritual one, let alone into several. The reason for this is that they differ as to the vertical levels discussed in part 3. </p>

294. Since the elements which constitute the sun of the spiritual world are from the Lord, and are not the Lord, therefore they do not possess life in itself, but are bereft of life in itself, just as the elements which flow from an angel or person and form the atmospheres about them are not the angel or person, but are from them, bereft of their life. These elements are coupled with the angel or person only in their accordance with them, having originated from the forms of their body, which in them were forms of their life.<p>This is a secret which angels with their spiritual ideas are able to see in thought and also express in speech, but which people with their natural ideas cannot, since a thousand spiritual ideas constitute a single natural idea, and a person cannot resolve a single natural idea into any spiritual idea, still less into so many. The reason he cannot is that these ideas differ according to degrees of height, as explained in Part Three. </p>

294. Since these things which constitute the Sun of the spiritual world are from the Lord, but are not the Lord, therefore they are not life in itself, but are devoid of life in itself. In the same way, those things which flow forth from an angel or a man, and make spheres around him, are not the angel or the man, but are from them though devoid of their life. These spheres make one with the angel or man only in that they are in accordance because taken from the forms of their bodies, which in them were forms of their life. This is an arcanum which angels, by means of their spiritual ideas, are able to see in thought and also express in speech, but men by their natural ideas are not, since a thousand spiritual ideas make one natural idea, and one natural idea cannot be resolved by man into any spiritual idea, much less into so many. The reason is that these ideas differ according to degrees of altitude which were treated in Part III. </p>

294. Because those things that constitute the sun of the spiritual world are from the Lord, but are not the Lord, they are not life in itself, but are devoid of life in itself; just as those things that flow forth from angel or man, and constitute spheres around him are not the angel or the man, but are from him, and devoid of his life. These spheres make one with the angel or man no otherwise than that they are concordant; and this they are because taken from the forms of their bodies, which in them were forms of their life. This is an arcanum which angels, with their spiritual ideas, are able to see in thought and also express in speech, but men with their natural ideas are not; because a thousand spiritual ideas make one natural idea, and one natural idea cannot be resolved by man into any spiritual idea, much less into so many. The reason is that these ideas differ according to degrees of height, which were treated of in Part Third. </p>

294. Quoniam illa quae Solem Mundi spiritualis constituunt, sunt a Domino, et non Dominus, ideo non sunt vita in se, sed sunt orbata vita in se, <sup>1</sup>
quemadmodum illa quae profluunt ex angelo et homine, ac faciunt sphaeras circum illos, non sunt angelus aut homo, sed sunt ex illis, orbata vita illorum, <sup>2</sup>
quae non aliter unum faciunt cum angelo aut homine, quam quod concordent, quia desumpta ex formis corporis illorum, quae formae vitae illorum in illis fuerunt. Hoc arcanum est, quod angeli per ideas suas spirituales cogitatione videre et quoque loquela exprimere possunt, non autem homines per ideas suas naturales, <sup>3</sup>
quoniam mille ideae spirituales faciunt unam ideam naturalem, ac una idea naturalis non ab homine resolvi potest in aliquam ideam spiritualem, minus in totidem: causa est, quia differunt secundum gradus altitudinis, de quibus in Parte Tertia. <p>
