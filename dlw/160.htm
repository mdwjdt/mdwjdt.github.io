<h4 align="center"></h4><p>160、由于自然界中形成大地的这些最低级事物是死的，不像在灵界那样照情感和思维的状态变化多样，而是固定不变，所以自然界有空间和空间距离。之所以有这类事物，是因为创造在那里终止，处于安歇状态。由此明显可知，空间是自然界的属性。因为跟灵界的空间不同，自然界的空间并非与生命状态一致的空间表象，它们也可称为死的。</p>

160. Since the lowest elements of nature that constitute our soils are dead and not varied and changeable in response to our states of feeling and thought the way they are in the spiritual world, but are unchangeable and stable, we have space and various spatial distances here. They have this stable nature because this is where creation comes to a close and remains at rest. We can see from this that space is proper to nature; and since space here is not an appearance of space responsive to states of life, the way it is in the spiritual world, we can refer to it as "dead." </p>

160. Since the lowest constituents of nature which form the elemental earths are lifeless, and they are not changeable and variable in accordance with states of affections and thoughts as in the spiritual world, but are inalterable and fixed, therefore we find in nature intervals of space and extents of space.<p>These constituents are as described because creation terminated in them and in its resting ceased. Consequently it is apparent that intervals of space are properties of nature; and because intervals of space in nature are not appearances of space in accordance with states of life as in the spiritual world, they can also be called lifeless. </p>

<p>
160. Since the lowest things of nature which make soils are dead, and are not changeable, varying according to states of affections and thoughts as in the spiritual world, but unchangeable and fixed, so in the natural world there are spaces and distances of spaces. There are such because there creation has terminated and remains in its inactivity. Hence it is clear that spaces are proper to nature, and because spaces there are not appearances of spaces according to states of life as they are in the spiritual world, they may also be called dead. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #160 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
160. Since these lowest things of nature which form the lands are dead, and are not changeable and varying according to states of affections and thoughts, as in the spiritual world, but unchangeable and fixed, therefore in nature there are spaces and spatial distances. There are such things, because creation has there terminated, and abides at rest. From this it is evident that spaces are a property of nature; and because in nature spaces are not appearances of spaces according to states of life, as they are in the spiritual world, these also may be called dead. </p>

<p>
160. Quoniam infima Naturae quae faciunt terras sunt mortua, et illa non sunt mutabilia et varia secundum status affectionum et cogitationum, ut in Mundo spirituali, sed immutabilia et fixa, ideo ibi spatia sunt, et spatiorum distantiae sunt: talia sunt, quia creatio ibi desiit, et in sua quiete subsistit; inde patet, quod spatia sint propria naturae; et quia spatia ibi non sunt apparentiae spatiorum secundum status vitae, ut in Mundo spirituali, possunt illa etiam vocari mortua. </p>
