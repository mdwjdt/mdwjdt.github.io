<h3 align="center" class="ired">《圣爱与圣智》 第128节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>128、由此可见，那些以为主随意赐下天堂，或随意恩赐某人比别人更有智慧，比别人更有爱的人陷入何等谬论、因而陷入何等虚假；而事实上，主愿意每个人都和别人一样变得智慧并得到拯救。祂也为所有人提供了方法；人在何等程度上接受这些方法并照之生活，就在何等程度上变得智慧并得到拯救；因为主在这人里面和在那人里面是一样的，只是作为天使和世人的接受者因不同的接受和生活而不同。这一事实从刚才有关灵界方位，以及与这些方位一致的天使居所的说明可以看出来，即：这种多样性不是主造成的，而是接受者造成的。</p>

128. We can see from this how caught up in illusion and consequent distortion people are if they think that the Lord parcels heaven out arbitrarily, or arbitrarily enables one person to be wiser and more loving than another. No, the Lord intends that one person should be just as wise and just as saved as another. He offers all of us the means. To the extent that we accept them and live by them, we are wise and we are saved, because the Lord is the same with one person as with another. The receivers, though, the angels and the people on earth, are different because of their differing receptivity and life.<p>This fits with what has already been said [<a href="124.htm" target=_top>124</a>] about the regions and about the way angels' locations depend on them, namely that the differences stem from the recipients and not from the Lord. </p>

128. It can be seen from this what a misconception and consequent falsity those people are caught up in who suppose that the Lord allots heaven arbitrarily, or that He arbitrarily grants one person to be wiser and more loving than another, when in fact the Lord wills everyone to be as wise and saved as another equally. For He provides for all the means. To the extent anyone accepts these means and lives in accordance with them, to that extent he becomes wise and is saved; for the Lord is the same in one person as in another. On the other hand, the recipients, who are angels and people, are not the same owing to their differing reception and life.<p>The fact of this can be seen from what we have now said about zones and the abodes of angels in accordance with them, namely, that this diversity is caused not by the Lord, but by the recipients. </p>

128. From these considerations it can be seen in what fallacy and consequent falsity are those who suppose that the Lord arbitrarily bestows heaven, or that He arbitrarily allows one to be wiser or to love more than another, when actually, the Lord wills that one equally with another may be wise and may be saved. For He provides the means for all. Everyone is wise and is saved in proportion as he receives these means and lives in accordance with them. For the Lord is the same with one as with another. But the recipients who are angels and men are dissimilar by reason of dissimilar reception and life. That such is the case can be established from those things which have now been said about quarters and about the angels' dwelling-places in accordance with them, namely, that the diversity is not from the Lord but from the recipients. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #128 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
128. From all this it can be seen in what fallacy and consequent falsity those are, who suppose that the Lord bestows heaven arbitrarily, or arbitrarily grants one to become wise and loving more than another, when, in truth, the Lord is just as desirous that one may become wise and be saved as another. For He provides means for all; and every one becomes wise and is saved in the measure in which he accepts these means, and lives in accordance with them. For the Lord is the same with one as with another; but the recipients, who are angels and men, are unlike by reason of unlike reception and life. That this is so can be seen from what has just been said of spiritual quarters, and of the dwelling-places of the angels in accordance with them; namely, that this diversity is not from the Lord but from the recipients. </p>

128. Ex his videri potest in qua fallacia et inde falsitate sunt illi, qui opinantur quod Dominus ex arbitrio impertiatur coelum, seu quod ex arbitrio det ut unus sapiat et amet plus quam alter; cum tamen Dominus aeque vult ut sapiat et salvetur unus ac alter: providet enim omnibus media; quisque sicut recipit illa et vivit secundum illa, ita sapit et salvatur, est enim Dominus idem apud unum et apud alterum; at quod recipientes, qui sunt angeli et homines, dissimiles sint ex dissimili receptione et vita. Quod ita sit, constare potest ex illis, quae nunc de plagis, et de habitationibus angelorum secundum illas, dicta sunt, quod nempe illa diversitas non sit a Domino, sed a recipientibus. </p>
