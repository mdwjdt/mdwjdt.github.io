<h4 align="center"></h4><p>180、拿天使的爱与智慧来对比世人的爱与智慧，更能明显看出爱与智慧必有层级之分。众所周知，两相对比之下，天使的智慧难以形容。下文我们将看到，在处于属世之爱的世人看来，这智慧是无法理解的。天使的智慧之所以显得难以形容、无法理解，是因为它处于更高层级。</p>

180. It is even clearer that there are levels of love and wisdom if we compare angels' love and wisdom with our love and wisdom. It is generally acknowledged that the wisdom of angels is unutterable, relatively speaking. You will see later [<a href="267.htm" target=_top>267</a>, <a href="416.htm" target=_top>416</a>] that it is also incomprehensible to us when we are wrapped up in our earthly love. The reason it seems unutterable and incomprehensible is that it is on a higher level. </p>

180. That there are degrees of love and wisdom is still more plainly apparent from the love and wisdom of angels in comparison to the love and wisdom of people. People know that the wisdom of angels is in comparison indescribable. We will see in subsequent discussions that it is also incomprehensible to people when they are caught up in a natural love. The reason it appears indescribable and incomprehensible is that is in a higher degree. </p>

<p>
180. That there are degrees of love and wisdom is still more clearly evident from the love and wisdom of angels compared to the love and wisdom of men. It is well known that the wisdom of angels is relatively ineffable; and it will be seen in what follows that it is incomprehensible to men when they are in natural love. The reason that it appears ineffable and incomprehensible is because it is in a higher degree. </p>

<h4 align="center">Divine Love and Wisdom #180 (Ager (1890))</h4>
<p>
180. That there must be degrees of love and wisdom is still more evident when the love and wisdom of angels are compared with the love and wisdom of men. It is well known that the wisdom of angels, when thus compared, is ineffable; also it will be seen in what follows that to men who are in natural love, this wisdom is incomprehensible. It appears ineffable and incomprehensible because it is of a higher degree. </p>

<h4 align="center">De Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia #180 (original Latin,1763)</h4>
<p>
180. Quod Gradus amoris et sapientiae dentur, adhuc manifestius patet ex amore et sapientia Angelorum respective ad amorem et sapientiam hominum: quod sapientia Angelorum respective sit ineffabilis, notum est; quod etiam sit hominibus, quando in naturali amore sunt, incomprehensibilis, videbitur in sequentibus: causa quod ineffabilis et incomprehensibilis appareat, est quia in superiori gradu est. </p>
