<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之信仰篇》 第49节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">七、那些处于与仁分离之信的人由圣言中的非利士人来代表</h4><p>Faith49.在圣言中，所有民族和人民的名字，以及人名和地名，都表示教会事物。教会本身由“以色列”和“犹大”来表示，因为教会建在他们当中；各种宗教观由他们周围的民族和人民来表示，与教会一致的宗教观由良善的民族来表示，与教会不一致的宗教观由邪恶的民族来表示。随着时间推移，每个教会都会堕入两种邪恶的宗教形式：一种是对教会良善的玷污，一种是对教会真理的歪曲。对教会良善的玷污源于控制欲或统治之爱，对教会真理的歪曲源于自我聪明的骄傲。在圣言中，源于控制欲或统治之爱的宗教形式由“巴比伦”来表示，源于自我聪明的骄傲的宗教形式由“非利士”来表示。人人都知道谁属于巴比伦，却不知道谁属于非利士。属于非利士的，是那些处于信，未处于仁的人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 49</h4><p>49. The Philistines Mentioned in the Word Represent People Devoted to a Faith Divorced from Caring<p>IN the Word all the names of nations and peoples as well as of persons and places are used to mean matters of the church. The church itself is meant by Israel and Judah because that is where it was established; and various other religious perspectives are meant by the surrounding nations and peoples—compatible perspectives by the good nations and incompatible ones by the evil nations.<p>There are two evil versions of religion into which all churches degenerate with the passage of time. One is the corruption of what a given church has that is good and the other is the distortion of what that church has that is true. The origin of the version that pollutes the good qualities of the church is the love of having complete control [over others], and the origin of the second version, which distorts the true ideas of the church, is pride in our own intelligence.<p>The version that comes from a love of having complete control is the one meant in the Word by Babylon, and the version that comes from pride in our own intelligence is the one meant in the Word by Philistia.<p>Everyone knows who the Babylonians are in our own times, but not who the Philistines are. The Philistines are people who are devoted to faith but not to caring. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 49</h4><p>49. People Whose Faith Is Divorced from Charity Are Represented in the Word by the Philistines<p>Names of nations and peoples in the Word, and of persons and places, all symbolize matters having to do with the church. The church itself is symbolized by Israel and Judah, because the church was instituted among them, and the nations and peoples surrounding them symbolized various religions — harmless nations symbolizing compatible religions, and harmful nations incompatible religions.<p>There are two harmful forms of religion into which every church degenerates in the course of time: one that adulterates its goods, and one that falsifies its truths.<p>The form of religion that adulterates the church’s goods takes its origin from a love of ruling, and the other, the religion that falsifies the church’s truths, takes its origin from a conceit in its own intelligence.<p>The religion that takes its origin from a love of ruling is meant in the Word by Babylon. And the religion that takes its origin from a conceit in its own intelligence is meant in the Word by Philistia.<p>People know who the adherents of Babylon are today, but they do not know who the adherents of Philistia are. The adherents of Philistia are those who have faith and not charity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 49</h4><p>49. VII. They who are in faith separated from charity, are represented in the Word by the Philistines<p>In the Word, by all the names of nations and peoples, as well as of persons and places, are signified things relating to the Church. The Church itself is signified by Israel and Judah, because it was established among their people; and various religious persuasions are signified by the nations and peoples round about them, the religions in harmony with the Church itself being signified by the good nations, and those not in harmony, by the wicked nations.<p>There are two evil religious persuasions into which every Church degenerates in course of time, one which adulterates its good principles and the other which falsifies its truths. That religion which adulterates the goods of the Church derives its origin from the love of rule; and the other, which falsifies the truths of the Church, derives its origin from the pride of self- intelligence. The religious persuasion which derives its origin from the love of rule, is meant in the Word by Babylon; and the religious persuasion which derives its origin from the pride of self-intelligence, is meant in the Word by Philistia. It is well known who they of Babylon are at the present day; but it is not known who they of Philistia are. They are of Philistia who are in faith and not in charity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 49</h4><p>49. IN THE WORD THEY WHO ARE IN FAITH SEPARATED FROM CHARITY ARE REPRESENTED BY THE PHILISTINES. <p>In the Word all the names of nations and peoples, and also those of persons and places, signify the things of the church. The church itself is signified by "Israel" and "Judah," because it was instituted among them; and various religious principles are signified by the nations and peoples around them, those accordant with the church by the good nations, and those discordant with it by the evil nations. There are two evil religious principles into which every church in course of time degenerates, one that adulterates its goods, and the other that falsifies its truths. That which adulterates the goods of the church springs from the love of rule, and that which falsifies the truths of the church springs from the conceit of self-intelligence. The religious principle that springs from the love of rule is meant in the Word by "Babylon," and that which springs from the conceit of self-intelligence is meant in the Word by "Philistia." Who at the present day belong to Babylon is known, but not who belong to Philistia. To Philistia belong those who are in faith and not in charity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 49 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>49. (VII.) QUOD ILLI QUI IN FIDE SEPARATA A CHARITATE SUNT, IN VERBO REPRAESENTATI SINT PER PHILISTHAEOS. <p>In Verbo per omnia nomina gentium et populorum, tum personarum et locorum, significantur res ecclesiae; ipsa ecclesia per Israelem et Jehudam, quia apud illos fuit instituta; et varia religiosa per gentes et populos circum illos; religiosa concordantia per gentes bonas, et religiosa discordantia per gentes malas. Sunt duo religiosa mala, in quae omnis ecclesia successu temporis degeneratur, unum quod adulterat bona ejus, et alterum quod falsificat Vera ejus. Illud religiosum, quod adulterat bona ecclesiae, trahit suum ortum ex amore imperandi; et alterum religiosum quod falsificat Vera ecclesiae, trahit suum ortum ex fastu propriae intelligentiae. Religiosum quod trahit ortum ex amore imperandi in Verbo intelligitur per Babyloniam; et religiosum, quod trahit ortum ex fastu propriae intelligentiae, in Verbo intelligitur per Philisthaeam. Notum est quinam ex Babylonia hodie sunt; sed non notum quinam ex Philisthaea. Ex Philisthaea sunt qui in fide et non in charitate. </p>
