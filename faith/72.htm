<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 72</h4><p>72. Make no mistake, though. That is what people are like when they convince themselves of faith alone in both theory and practice. It does not apply to people who turn their backs on evils because they are sins even though they have heard and believed that faith alone saves. </p><h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 72</h4><p>72. Still, the fact is that people of this description are people who have confirmed themselves in faith alone in both doctrine and life. But not people who, even though they have been taught and have believed that faith alone is saving, still, despite this, have refrained from evils as being sins. </p><h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 72</h4><p>72. Such in very truth is the character of those who have confirmed themselves in faith alone, both in doctrine and in life; but not of those who, although they have heard and believed that faith alone saves, have nevertheless shunned evils as sins. </p><h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 72</h4><p>72. But I wish to say emphatically that it is those who have confirmed themselves by both doctrine and life in faith alone who are of this character, and by no means those who, although they have heard and have believed that faith alone saves, have nevertheless shunned evils as sins. </p><h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 72 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>72. Verum enim vero, tales sunt illi qui se in sola fide et doctrina et vita confirmaverunt; sed non illi, qui, tametsi audiverunt et crediderunt quod sola fides salvet, usque mala ut peccata fugerunt. </p><br><p align="center"><a href="71.htm">上一节</a>　 <a href="0.htm">目录</a></p></div>
