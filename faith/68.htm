<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith68.（4）那些处于与仁分离之信的人由圣言中的“山羊”来表示，这一点可从马太福音所提到的那些人对仁的忽略来说明。马太福音（25:31-46）中的“山羊”和“绵羊”所表示的那些人，与但以理书8章中的“公山羊”和“公绵羊”所表示的一样，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：主向绵羊列举了仁爱的行为，经上说，他们做了这些行为；主同样向山羊列举了这些行为，但经上说，他们没有做这些行为；后者因此被定罪。那些处于与仁分离之信的人忽略行为，是因为他们否认行为与救恩或教会有任何关系；当由行为构成的仁以这种方式被抛弃时，信也就落空了，因为信出于仁；当既没有仁，也没有信时，就有了诅咒。如果这段经文中的山羊表示一切恶人，那么经上就会列举他们所做的一切恶事，而不是他们没有做的一切仁爱行为了。这些人也由撒迦利亚书和以西结书中的“公山羊”来表示：</p>
<p>我的怒气向牧人发作，我必察罚公山羊。（撒迦利亚书10:3）</p>
<p>以西结书：</p>
<p>看哪，我要在羊与羊中间、公绵羊与公山羊中间施行审判。你们吃了美好的草场，还以为小事吗？剩下的草，你们竟用蹄践踏了；你们用角拥挤一切瘦弱的羊，直到使它们四散。所以我必拯救我的群羊不再作猎物。（以西结书34:17-18，21-22等）</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 68</h4><p>68. 4. The failure of caring in the people described in Matthew shows that goats mean people who are devoted to a faith divorced from caring. We can see that the goats and sheep in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a> have the same meaning as the goat and the ram in Daniel because deeds of caring are listed for the sheep and it says that they did them, and the same deeds of caring are listed for the goats but it says that they did not do them, and that this is why these latter are condemned. A neglect of deeds is characteristic of people who are devoted to a faith divorced from caring because of their refusal to believe that deeds have anything to do with salvation or the church. When people so set aside caring—which consists of deeds—then faith fails as well, because faith comes out of caring; and when there is neither caring nor faith, there is damnation.<p>If the goats in this passage had meant all evil people it would have listed all the evil things they did rather than all the deeds of caring they did not do.<p>People like this are also meant by goats in Zechariah:<p>My wrath blazes against the shepherds, and I will execute judgment upon the goats. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_10_3.htm">Zechariah 10:3</a>)<p>And in Ezekiel:<p>Behold, I am judging between sheep and sheep, between rams and goats. Is it too little for you to have eaten up the good pasture? Will you also trample what remains of the food with your feet? You attack all the weak sheep with your horns until you have scattered them. Therefore I will save my flock, so that it will no longer be prey. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_17.htm">Ezekiel 34:17-18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_21.htm">21-22</a>, and following)<p>A Faith Divorced from Caring Destroys the Church and Everything It Stands For </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 68</h4><p>68. IV. That people whose faith is divorced from charity are meant in the Word by goats is something shown by their lack of charity as told in Matthew. The goats and sheep in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a> mean the very same people as those meant by the goat and ram in Daniel, and this is apparent from the fact that enumerated for the sheep are a list of charitable works, and we are told that they did them; and that enumerated for the goats is the same list of charitable works, and we are told that they did not do them, who are therefore condemned. For works are lacking in the case of people whose faith is divorced from charity, owing to their denial that works involve anything having to do with salvation or the church. And when charity, which consists in works, is thus set aside, faith also founders, since faith is an expression of charity. Then, when there is no longer any charity or faith, damnation results.<p>If all evil people were meant by the goats there, we would find listed not charitable works that they did not do, but the evils that they had done.<p>The same kind of people are also meant by goats in Zechariah:<p>My anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will visit judgment on the goats. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_10_3.htm">Zechariah 10:3</a>)<p>And in Ezekiel:<p>…I judge between one flock and another, between rams and goats. Is it too little for you to have eaten up the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture…? …Because you have…struck all the weak sheep with your horns, until you scattered them abroad, therefore I will save My flock, so that it shall no longer be prey. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_17.htm">Ezekiel 34:17-18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_21.htm">21-22</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 68</h4><p>68. 4. THEY WHO ARE IN FAITH SEPARATED FROM CHARITY, ARE MEANT BY THE GOATS. THIS APPEARS FROM THE NEGLECT OF CHARITY ON THE PART OF THOSE MENTIONED IN MATTHEW.<p>That no others are meant by the goats and the sheep in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>, but those who are meant by the he-goat and the ram in Daniel, is plain from this circumstance, that unto the sheep are enumerated the works of charity, and it is said that they did them; and that unto the goats are enumerated the same works of charity, and it is said that they did them not and were therefore condemned. For with those who are in faith separated from charity, there is neglect of works, in consequence of their denying that there is anything of salvation and of the Church in them: and when charity, which consists in works, is thus removed, faith also falls, because faith has its origin in charity; and when there is no charity and faith, damnation ensues.<p>If all the wicked had been meant there by the goats, there would not have been enumerated the works of charity which they did not perform, but the evils which they did. Such persons are also meant by the goats in Zechariah:<p>Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the goats. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_10_3.htm">Zechariah 10:3</a>;<p>And in Ezekiel:<p>Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he-goats.<p>Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures?<p>Ye have pushed all the feeble sheep with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;<p>Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_17.htm">Ezekiel 34:17-18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_21.htm">21-22</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 68</h4><p>68. IV. That those in faith separated from charity are meant by "goats," shown from the neglect of charity by those of whom mention is made in Matthew. That the "goats" and "sheep" in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a> mean the very same persons as those meant by the "he-goat" and "ram" in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8</a> is evident from the fact that works of charity are recounted to the sheep, and it is said that they had done them; and that the same works of charity are recounted to the goats, and it is said that they had done them not, and that the latter are condemned on that account. For works are neglected by those who are in faith separated from charity, in consequence of their denying that there is anything of salvation or of the church therein; and when charity, which consists in works, is set aside in this way, faith also falls to the ground, because faith is from charity; and when there are no charity and faith there is condemnation. If all the evil had been meant there by the goats, there would not have been recounted the works of charity they had not done, but the evils they had done. The same persons are meant by the "he-goats" also in Zechariah: <p>Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I will visit upon the he-goats.(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_10_3.htm">Zechariah 10:3</a>). <p>And in Ezekiel: <p>Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he-goats. Is it a small thing to you that ye have eaten up the good pastures, but ye must also tread down with your feet the residue of the pastures? ye have pushed all the feeble sheep with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad; therefore will I save My flock, that it may no more be for a prey (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_17.htm">Ezekiel 34:17-18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_21.htm">21-22</a>, etc.). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 68 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>68. (iv.) Quod illi qui in fide separata a charitate sunt, intelligantur per "hircos;" ex omissione charitatis eorum apud Matthaeum. Quod non alii per "hircos" ac per "oves" intelligantur apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_68/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_25_31-46">Matthaeum 25:31-46</a> quam qui per "hircum" et per "arietem" apud Danielem, patet ex eo, quod ad oves enumerentur opera charitatis, et dicatur, quod illa fecerint; et quod ad hircos enumerentur eadem opera charitatis, et dicatur quod illa non fecerint, et quod hi ideo damnentur: est enim apud eos qui in fide separata a charitate sunt, omissio operum, ex negatione quod nihil salutis et ecclesiae in illis sit; et cum removetur ita charitas, quae consistit in operibus, cadit etiam fides, quoniam fides est ex charitate; et cum non charitas et fides, est damnatio. Si omnes mali per "hircos" ibi intellecti fuissent, non opera charitatis quae non fecerunt, sed mala quae fecerunt, enumerata fuissent. Similes per "hircos" etiam intelliguntur apud Sachariam, <p>"Super pastores exarsit ira mea, et super hircos visitabo" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_68/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_10_3">10:3</a>). <p>Et apud Ezechielem, <p>"Ecce Ego judicans inter pecudem et pecudem, inter arietes et inter hircos: num parum vobis, pascuum bonum depascitis, etiam reliquum pascuorum conculcatis pedibus vestris?... cornibus vestris feritis omnes oves infirmas, donec disperseritis illas: ideo salvabo gregem meum, ut non sit amplius in praedam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_68/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_34_17-18">34:17-18</a>, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_68/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_34_21">21</a>,) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_68/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_34_22">22</a>, seq.). </p>
