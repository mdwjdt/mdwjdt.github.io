<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之信仰篇》 第42节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith42.这位天使说，他与那位处于与仁分离之信的人的对话如下：</p>
<p>“朋友，你是谁？”</p>
<p>“我是一名新教基督徒。”</p>
<p>“你的教义和你从中所形成的宗教是什么？”</p>
<p>“它就是信。”</p>
<p>“你的信是什么？”</p>
<p>“我的信是：父神差祂的儿子为人类作出补偿，那些相信这一点的人得救了。”</p>
<p>“关于得救，你还知道些什么？”</p>
<p>“唯信得救。”</p>
<p>“关于救赎，你都知道些什么？”</p>
<p>“救赎通过十架受难实现了，圣子的功德通过这信被转稼给人。”</p>
<p>“关于重生，你都知道些什么？”</p>
<p>“重生通过信实现。”</p>
<p>“关于悔改和罪得赦免，你都知道些什么？”</p>
<p>“它们通过这信实现。”</p>
<p>“请告诉我你对爱和仁都知道些什么。”</p>
<p>“它们就是这信。”</p>
<p>“请告诉我你对善行都知道些什么。”</p>
<p>“它们就是这信。”</p>
<p>“请告诉我你对圣言中的一切诫命是怎么想的？”</p>
<p>“它们都在这信里面。”</p>
<p>“所以你什么都没做？”</p>
<p>“我应该做什么呢？我凭自己无法行出真正为良善的任何善事。”</p>
<p>“你能凭自己拥有信吗？”</p>
<p>“我不能。”</p>
<p>“那么你怎么可能拥有信呢？”</p>
<p>“我不探讨这个问题；我只需要有信。”</p>
<p>最后天使说：“关于救恩，你肯定知道得多一些。”他回答说：“既然救恩唯独通过这信得来，我还有什么需要知道的呢？”但这时天使说：“你的回答就像一个只吹一个音符的吹笛人。除了信，我什么都没听见。如果这就是你所知道的一切，那么你什么都不知道。去看看你的同伴吧。”于是他离开，在寸草不生的荒漠之地找到他的同伴。他问为什么会是这样，得到的答复是：因为他们里面没有一丝教会之物。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 42</h4><p>42. The angel told me of the following conversation with the individual who was devoted to a faith divorced from caring.<p>“Friend, who are you?”<p>“I am a Protestant Christian.”<p>“What is your theology, and what religious practice does it lead to?”<p>“Faith.”<p>“What is your faith?”<p>“My faith is that God the Father sent his Son to make complete amends for the human race, and that those who believe this are saved.”<p>“What else do you know about salvation?”<p>“Salvation is granted through this faith alone.”<p>“What do you know about redemption?”<p>“Redemption was effected through the suffering on the cross; the merit of the Son is credited to us through this faith.”<p>“What do you know about regeneration?”<p>“Regeneration happens by means of this faith.”<p>“What do you know about repentance and the forgiveness of sins?”<p>“They happen by means of this faith.”<p>“Tell me what you know about love and caring.”<p>“They are this faith.”<p>“Tell me what you know about good works.”<p>“They are this faith.”<p>“Tell me what you think of all the commandments in the Word.”<p>“They are in this faith.”<p>“So you do not do anything?”<p>“What should I do? On my own, I cannot do anything good that is really good.”<p>“Can you have faith on your own?”<p>“I cannot.”<p>“Then how can you have faith?”<p>“I don’t ask questions about this; I just have to have faith.”<p>Finally, “Do you know anything else, anything at all, about salvation?”<p>“What else is there to know, when salvation is granted through this faith alone?”<p>But then the angel said, “You sound like someone who keeps playing the same note on a flute. All I hear is ‘faith.’ If that is all you know, and nothing else, then you don’t know anything. Go see your companions.” So the Protestant Christian went and met others in a wilderness where there was no grass. When the angels were asked why there was not even grass there, they said, “Because they have no trace of a church.” </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 42</h4><p>42. The angel said that his conversation with the one whose faith was divorced from charity went as follows:<p>"Who are you, friend?" the angel asked.<p>He replied, "I am a Reformed Christian."<p>"What is your doctrine, and accordingly your religion?" asked the angel.<p>He said it was faith.<p>"What is your faith?" the angel inquired.<p>He replied, "My faith is that God the Father sent the Son to make satisfaction for the human race, and that those are saved who believe this."<p>At that the angel questioned him by asking, "What more do you know about salvation?"<p>He replied that salvation is achieved through that faith alone.<p>The angel questioned him further. "What do you know about redemption?"<p>He replied that it was accomplished by the suffering of the cross, and that the merit of the Son is imputed in consequence of that faith.<p>The angel then asked, "What do you know about regeneration?"<p>He replied that it results from that faith.<p>"What do you know about repentance and the forgiveness of sins?" asked the angel.<p>He replied that they come about as a result of that faith.<p>"Tell me, then," said the angel, "what you know about love and charity."<p>He replied that they are what that faith is.<p>"Tell me," said the angel, "what you know about good works."<p>He replied that they are what that faith is.<p>"Tell me," said the angel, "what you think of all the commandments in the Word."<p>He replied that they are encompassed by that faith.<p>At that the angel said, "Then you know nothing."<p>He replied, "What am I to do? I cannot do good that is good of myself."<p>The angel asked, "Can you have faith of yourself?"<p>He replied, "I cannot."<p>"How then," asked the angel, "can you have faith?"<p>He said, "I don’t inquire into this. I just must have faith."<p>Finally the angel said, "You know nothing at all about salvation beyond that."<p>He replied, "What more is there, seeing that salvation is achieved through faith alone?"<p>However, at that the angel said, "You answer like a piper who sounds only one note. You tell me nothing but ‘faith. ’ If that is what you know, and nothing more, then you know nothing. Go and see your fellows."<p>So he went and came across his fellows in a desert, where no grass grew. He asked why that was. They said it was because they had nothing of the church in them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 42</h4><p>42. The angel said that with him who was in faith separated from charity, he discoursed as follows: "My friend, what are you?" He replied, "I am a Reformed Christian." "What is your doctrine, and the religion you form from it?" He replied that it was faith. He then asked, "What is your faith?" and he answered, "This is my faith: God the Father sent His Son to make satisfaction for mankind, and they are saved who believe this." The angel then asked him, "What more do you know respecting salvation?" He replied that salvation was through that faith alone. The angel further asked, "What do you know respecting redemption?" He replied that this was effected by the passion of the cross, and that the merit of the Son is imputed through that faith. The angel then asked, "What do you know of regeneration?" He replied that this is effected by that faith. Again, "What do you know of repentance and the remission of sins?" and he answered that they are effected by that faith. Then the angel said, "Tell me what do you know about love and charity?" and he answered that they are that faith. Again, "Tell me what do you know about good works?" and he answered that they are that faith. Again he said, "What do you think about all the commandments in the Word?" and he replied that they are included in that faith. Then the angel said, "You will therefore do nothing?" To this he replied, "What can I do? I cannot do good, which is good, of myself." Again he asked "Can you have faith of yourself?" and he replied that he could not. The angel thereupon asked, "How then can you have faith?" to which he replied, "This I do not inquire into. I must have faith." At length the angel said, "Surely you know something more respecting salvation?" and he answered, "What more should I know when salvation is effected by that faith alone?" Then the angel said, "You answer like one who plays but one note on his pipe: I hear nothing but faith. If you know this and no more, you know nothing. Go and behold your companions." He went away and found them in a desert place where there was no grass. He asked why that was so, and the answer he received was, "Because there is nothing of the Church in them." </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 42</h4><p>42. The angel said that with him who was in faith separated from charity he spoke as follows: <p>"Friend, who are you?" "I am a Reformed Christian." "What is your doctrine and the religion you have from it?" "It is faith." "What is your faith?" "My faith is that 'God the Father sent the Son to make satisfaction for mankind, and that they are saved who believe this.'" "What more do you know about salvation?" "Salvation is through that faith alone." "What do you know about redemption?" "It was effected by the passion of the cross, and the Son's merit is imputed through that faith." "What do you know about regeneration?" "It is effected through that faith." <p>"What do you know about repentance and the remission of sins?" "They are effected through that faith." "Say what you know about love and charity." "They are that faith." "Say what you know about good works." "They are that faith." "Say what you think about all the things commanded in the Word." "They are in that faith." "There is nothing then that you are to do?" "What is there for me to do? I cannot of myself do good that is really good." "Can you have faith of yourself?" "I cannot." "How then is it possible for you to have faith?" "That I do not inquire into. I am to have faith." <p>Finally the angel said, "Surely you know something more than this about salvation." He replied, "What more is there for me to know, seeing that salvation is obtained through that faith alone?" <p>Then the angel said, "You answer like a fifer who sounds only one note: I hear of naught but faith. If that is all you know, you know nothing. Depart, and behold your associates." <p>So he departed and came upon his associates in a desert, where there was no grass. He asked why that was so, and was told that it was because there was nothing of the church in them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 42 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>42. Angelus dixit, quod cum illo qui in fide separata a charitate ita locutus sit; "Amice, quis es?" Respondit ille, "Sum Reformatus Christianus." "Quae tua doctrina, et inde religio?" Respondit quod sit fides. Dixit, "Quae tua fides?" Respondit, "Fides mea est Quod Deus Pater miserit Filium, ut satisfaceret pro Humano Genere, et quod salventur qui id credunt.'" Interrogavit tunc dicendo, "Quid scis plus, de salvatione?" Respondit, quod salvatio sit per solam illam fidem. Porro dixit, "Quid scis de redemptione?" Respondit quod facta sit per passionem crucis, et quod meritum Filii imputetur per illam fidem. Porro, "Quid scis de regeneratione?" Respondit quod fiat per illam fidem. "Quid scis de paenitentia et remissione peccatorum?" Respondit quod per illam fidem. "Dic quid scis de amore et charitate." Respondit quod sint illa fides. "Dic quid scis de bonis operibus." Respondit quod sint illa fides. "Dic quid cogitas de omnibus praeceptis in Verbo." Respondit quod sint in illa fide. Tunc dixit, "Ergo nihil facies." Respondit, "Quid faciam? non possum facere bonum, quod bonum est, a me." Dixit, "Num fidem potes habere a te?" Respondit, "Non possum." Dixit, "Quomodo tunc potes fidem habere?" Respondit, "In hoc non inquiro; habebo fidem." Tandem dixit, "Omnino scis aliquid praeterea de salute." Respondit, "Quid praeterea, cum per solam illam fidem salvatio?" Sed tunc dixit angelus, "Respondes sicut qui canit uno tono tibiae; non audio nisi fidem. Si illam scis, et non praeterea, nihil scis. Abi et vide socios." Et abivit et offendit illos in deserto, ubi non gramen. Quaesivit cur ita; dixerunt, quia illis nihil ecclesiae. </p>
