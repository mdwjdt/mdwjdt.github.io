<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith9.盲目的信仰后来存在于新教教徒当中，因为他们将信与仁分离；人们若将两者分离，就必陷入对真理的无知之中；他们将信定义为纯粹的思想，即思想某事是真的，完全撇开了对此的任何内在承认。对这些人来说，无知也是教条主义的保障、捍卫者，因为只要无知，加上神学问题超越理解力这种说服占据主导地位，他们就能什么都说，且不会遭到反驳。他们能相信他们所说的是真的，并且他们自己明白这些话。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 9</h4><p>9. Blind faith also lived on among many Protestants because they separated faith from caring; and if people separate these two things, then they cannot help but be ignorant of what is true, and they define faith as thinking that something is true apart from any inner recognition that it is true. For such people, ignorance is the defender of dogmatism, because as long as ignorance holds sway, accompanied by the conviction that theological matters are beyond reach, they can say anything and not be contradicted. They can believe that what they say is true and that they understand it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 9</h4><p>9. A blind faith continued also afterward among many of the Protestant Reformed, because they divorced faith from charity, and people who divorce these cannot help but be ignorant of the truth. They also cannot help but call faith whatever they think to be so, apart from any internal acknowledgment of its being so.<p>In their case ignorance is a protection for their dogmas. For as long as ignorance reigns, together with the belief that theological matters transcend comprehension, they can speak without being contradicted, and have the people believe that their dogmas are true and that they themselves understand them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 9</h4><p>9. A blind faith continued afterwards among Protestants also, because they separated faith from charity. For those who separate these cannot but be in ignorance of the truth, and give the name of faith to the mere thought that a thing is so, apart from the internal acknowledgment that it is so. With these also ignorance is the safeguard of their dogmas; for as long as ignorance reigns, together with the persuasion that theological matters transcend the understanding, they can talk without being contradicted, and others can believe that their dogmas are true, and that they themselves understand them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 9</h4><p>9. Blind faith survived later with many of the Reformed, because they had separated faith from charity, for they who separate these two must needs be in ignorance of truth, and they will give the name of faith to the mere thought that the thing is so, quite apart from any internal acknowledgment. With these also, ignorance is the safeguard of dogma, for so long as ignorance bears sway, together with the persuasion that theological matters transcend comprehension, they can speak without being contradicted, and it can be believed that their tenets are true, and that they themselves understand them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 9 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>9. Fides caeca etiam permansit postea apud plures Reformatos, ex causa quia separaverunt fidem a charitate; et qui separant illas non possunt non in ignorantia veri esse, et cogitationem quod ita sit separatam ab agnitione interna quod ita sit, nominare fidem, Apud hos ignorantia est tutamen dogmatum; nam quamdiu ignorantia regnat, et persuasio quod theologica transcendant, possunt loqui et non contradici, et credi quod vera sint, et quod ii intelligant illa. </p>
