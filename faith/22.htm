<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith22.真正被称为爱的，是对主之爱，对邻之爱是仁。对人来说，对主之爱只能存在于仁里面；主正是在仁里面与一个人结合的。由于就其本质而言，信就是仁，所以可推知，没有人能拥有对主的信，除非他处于仁。结合从仁通过信而来；主通过仁与人结合，人通过信与主结合。结合是相互的，对此，可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》（102-107节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 22</h4><p>22. Love for the Lord is what “love” really means, and love for our neighbor is caring. There can be no love for the Lord in us except when we are caring: it is in this that the Lord unites with us.<p>Since faith in its essence is caring, it follows that no one can have faith in the Lord except while caring. Union comes from caring, through faith—a union of the Lord with us through caring and a union of us with the Lord through faith. On the reciprocal nature of this union, see <a href="../life/102.htm">The Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem 102-107</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 22</h4><p>22. Properly speaking, love is love toward the Lord, and love for the neighbor is charity. It is impossible for a person to have love toward the Lord unless he possesses charity. It is in charity that the Lord conjoins himself with a person.<p>Because faith in its essence is charity, it follows that no one can have faith in the Lord unless he possesses charity. It is charity operating through faith that brings about conjunction — charity occasioning a conjunction of the Lord with a person, and faith a conjunction of the person with the Lord.<p>That the conjunction is a reciprocal one may be seen in . </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 22</h4><p>22. Love to the Lord is love properly so called, and love towards the neighbour is charity. There does not exist in man any love to the Lord except in charity, and in this the Lord conjoins Himself with man. Since faith in its essence is charity, it follows that no one can have faith in the Lord unless he is in charity. From this, by means of faith, there is conjunction: by charity, conjunction of the Lord with man; and by faith, conjunction of man with the Lord. That the conjunction is reciprocal may be seen in <a href="../life/102.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF LIFE FOR THE NEW JERUSALEM 102-107</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 22</h4><p>22. Love to the Lord is Love properly so called, and love toward the neighbor is Charity. With man no love to the Lord is possible except in charity; it is in charity that the Lord conjoins Himself with a man. As, in its essence, faith is charity, it follows that no one can have faith in the Lord unless he is in charity. There is conjunction from charity through faith; through charity conjunction of the Lord with man, and through faith conjunction of man with the Lord. (That the conjunction is reciprocal, see the <a href="../life/102.htm">Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem 102-107</a>.) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 22 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>22. Amor in Dominum est proprie amor, et amor erga proximum est charitas. Non datur apud hominem amor in Dominum, nisi in charitate; in hac Dominus Se conjungit cum homine. Quia fides in sua essentia est charitas, sequitur quod nemo possit habere fidem in Dominum nisi in charitate sit; ex hac per fidem est conjunctio, per charitatem conjunctio Domini cum homine, et per fidem conjunctio hominis cum Domino. Quod conjunctio reciproca sit, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_22/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_102">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 102-107</a>. </p>
