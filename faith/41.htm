<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith41.为叫人们看清与仁分离的信是何性质，未与仁分离的信又是何性质，我将传达我从一位天堂天使那里听来的信息。他说，他曾与许多新教教徒交谈过，并获知他们的信是何性质；他讲述了他与一个处于与仁分离之信的人和一个处于未如此分离之信的人的谈话，以及他从两人那里听来的东西。他说，他向他们提问，他们作了回答。由于这些谈话可以阐明这个主题，所以我在此呈上它们。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 41</h4><p>41. All the same, to show the nature of a faith divorced from caring and a faith not divorced from it, I would like to share something I heard from one of heaven’s angels. This angel described having talked with many Protestants to learn about their faith, and told of a conversation with one devoted to a faith divorced from caring and a conversation with one devoted to a faith not divorced from caring. The angel told me what questions had been posed and what the responses had been; and since they can shed light on the subject, I would now like to present these conversations. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 41</h4><p>41. Still, to show the nature of faith divorced from charity, and the nature of faith not divorced from it, I wish to communicate something I heard from an angel in heaven. The angel said that he had spoken with many of the Protestant Reformed and heard the nature of their faith. And he reported his conversation with one whose faith was divorced from charity, and his conversation with another whose faith was not divorced from charity, and what he learned from them. The angel said that he asked them questions, which they answered. Because they may shed light on the subject, I wish to present these conversations here. </p> 
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 41</h4><p>41. But yet, that it may be seen what the nature of faith is when separated from charity, and what its nature is when not separated from charity, I will communicate what I heard from an angel of heaven. He said that he had conversed with many of the Reformed, and had heard what the nature of their faith was. He related his conversation with one who was in faith separated from charity, and with another who was in faith not so separated, and what he had heard from both. He said that he had put questions to them, and that they returned answers. As these conversations may throw light on this subject, I will here relate them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 41</h4><p>41. Still, in order that it may be seen what is the character of faith separated from charity, and what that of faith not separated from it, I will impart something which I heard from an angel of heaven. He said that he had conversed with many of the Reformed, and had heard what was the character of their faith, and he related his conversation with one who was in faith separated from charity, and with another who was in faith not separated, and what he had heard from them. He said that he questioned them, and they made answer. As what was said may elucidate the subject, I will here present the two conversations. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 41 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>41. At usque ut videatur qualis fides separata a charitate est, et qualis fides non separata ab illa est, velim communicare quae ab angelo caeli audivi. Dixit ille quod locutus sit cum multis Reformatis, et audiverit qualis fides illorum est; et retulit quid cum uno qui in fide separata a charitate fuit, et quid cum altero qui in fide non separata, locutus est, et ab illis audivit. Dixit quod interrogaverit illos, et quod illi responderint. Quae quia illustrare possunt, velim collocutiones illorum hic afferre. </p>
