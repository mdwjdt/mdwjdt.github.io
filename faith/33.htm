<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith33.这几句话足以说明，在人处于仁之前，真理和良善的知识或认知并不构成信；不过，它们是仁之信能从中得以形成的材料库。对一个重生之人来说，真理的知识或认知变成了真理，良善的知识或认知也是如此，因为良善的知识或认知在理解力中，对良善的情感在意愿中；在理解力中的东西被称为真理，在意愿中的东西被称为良善。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 33</h4><p>33. These few thoughts may suffice to show that our knowledge of what is true and good does not constitute faith until we are committed to caring, but that it is a resource from which a caring faith can be formed.<p>Our knowledge of what is true is true for us when we have been regenerated. So is our knowledge of what is good, since our learning about what is good takes place in our understanding, but a desire to do what is good develops in our will. So we call something true if it is in our understanding and call it good if it is in our will.<p>The [True] Christian Faith in One All-Encompassing View </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 33</h4><p>33. From these few observations it can be seen that concepts of truth and goodness are not ones of faith before a person is prompted by charity, but are a storehouse from which the faith accompanying charity may be formed. Concepts of truth become truths in a regenerate person, and so, too, concepts of goodness. For a concept of goodness resides in the intellect, but an affection for goodness in the will. And truth is something that resides in the intellect, and goodness something that resides in the will. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 33</h4><p>33. From these few considerations it may be evident that cognitions of truth and good are not related to faith before a man is in charity; but that they are a store out of which the faith of charity may be formed. Cognitions of truth become truths in a regenerate man, as also do cognitions of good, for the knowledge of good is in the understanding, but the affection of good is in the will; and what is in the understanding is called truth, and what is in the will is called good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 33</h4><p>33. From these few words it may be considered settled that the knowledges of truth and good are not really things of faith until the man is in charity, but that they are the storehouse of material out of which the faith of charity can be formed. With a regenerate person the knowledges of truth become truths, and so do the knowledges of good, for the knowledge of good is in the understanding, and the affection of good in the will, and what is in the understanding is called truth, and what is in the will is called good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 33 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>33. Ex his paucis constare potest quod cognitiones veri et boni non sint fidei, antequam homo in charitate est; sed quod sint promptuarium, ex quo fides charitatis formari possit. Cognitiones veri fiunt vera apud regeneratum; etiam cognitiones boni, nam cognitio boni est in intellectu, at affectio boni in voluntate; ac verum vocatur id quod in intellectu est, et bonum id quod in voluntate. </p>
