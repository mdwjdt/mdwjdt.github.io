<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith43.这位天使与那位处于未与仁分离之信的人的对话如下：</p>
<p>“朋友，你是谁？”</p>
<p>“我是一名新教基督徒。”</p>
<p>“你的教义和你从中所形成的宗教是什么？”</p>
<p>“信与仁。”</p>
<p>“这是两样东西吗？”</p>
<p>“它们不可分离。”</p>
<p>“什么是信？”</p>
<p>“相信圣言的教导。”</p>
<p>“什么是仁？”</p>
<p>“行出圣言的教导。”</p>
<p>“你只是相信这些事，还是也行出来？”</p>
<p>“我也行出来。”</p>
<p>于是，这位天堂天使看着他说：“我的朋友，请跟我来，与我们同住。”</p>

The following is the conversation of the angel with the individual who was devoted to a faith not divorced from caring.<p>“Friend, who are you?”<p>“I am a Protestant Christian.”<p>“What is your theology, and what religious practice does it lead to?”<p>“Faith and caring.”<p>“That is two things.”<p>“They cannot be separated.”<p>“What is faith?”<p>“Believing what the Word teaches us.”<p>“What is caring?”<p>“Doing what the Word teaches.”<p>“Do you just believe this, or do you also do it?”<p>“I do it as well.”<p>The angel from heaven then looked at this individual and said, “My friend, come with me and live with us.” </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 43</h4><p>43. The angel’s conversation with the one whose faith was not divorced from charity went as follows:<p>"Who are you, friend?" the angel asked.<p>He replied, "I am a Reformed Christian."<p>"What is your doctrine, and accordingly your religion?" asked the angel.<p>He replied, "Faith and charity."<p>"Those are two things," said the angel.<p>He replied, "They cannot be separated."<p>"What," the angel asked, "is faith?"<p>He replied, "It is to believe what the Word teaches."<p>"What," the angel asked, "is charity?"<p>He replied, "It is to do what the Word teaches."<p>"Do you only believe them," the angel asked, "or do you also do them?"<p>He replied, "I also do them."<p>The angel in heaven then looked at him and said, "Come with me, my friend, and dwell with us." </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 43</h4><p>43. The angel's discourse with him who was in faith not separated from charity was as follows: "My friend, what are you?" He replied, "I am a Reformed Christian." "What is your doctrine and the religion you form from it?" He replied that it was faith and charity. He said, "These are two," and the other replied that they cannot be separated. He asked, "What is faith?" and the answer was, "Believing what the Word teaches." He then asked, "What is charity?" and was answered, "Doing what the Word teaches." He then said, "Have you only believed these things or have you also acted up to them?" and the other replied, "I have also acted up to them." Then the angel of heaven, looking upon him said, "My friend, come with me and dwell with us." </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 43</h4><p>43. With the one who was in faith not separated from charity, the angel spoke as follows: <p>"Friend, who are you?" "I am a Reformed Christian." "What is your doctrine and the religion you have from it?" "Faith and charity." "These are two things?" "They cannot be separated." "What is faith?" "To believe what the Word teaches." "What is charity?" "To do what the Word teaches." "Have you only believed these things, or have you also done them?" "I have also done them." <p>The angel of heaven then looked at him, and said, "My friend, come with me, and dwell with us." </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 43 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>43. Angelus cum illo qui in fide non separata a charitate, ita locutus est: "Amice, quis es?" Respondit, "Sum Christianus Reformatus." "Quae tua doctrina, et inde religio?" Respondit, "Fides et charitas." Dixit, "Haec sunt duo." Respondit, "Non separari possunt." "Dixit, "Quid fides?" Respondit, "Credere quod Verbum docet." Dixit, "Quid charitas?" Respondit, "Facere quod Verbum docet." Dixit, "Num solum credideris illa, vel num etiam feceris?" Respondit, "Etiam feci." Angelus caeli tunc aspexit illum, et dixit, "Mi amice, veni mecum, et habita nobiscum." </p>
