<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith36.人这一方的基督信仰的普遍原则是：他当信主，因为与主的结合通过信祂实现，这是得救的方法。信祂就是对祂会拯救充满信心；由于除了过着良善生活的人外，没有人能拥有这种信心，所以这也是信祂之意。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 36</h4><p>36. Central to the [true] Christian faith as it applies to us is that we believe in the Lord, since believing in him is the union with him that gives us salvation. Believing in him is trusting that he saves people; and since we can have this trust only if we live good lives, believing in him also means leading a good life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 36</h4><p>36. The universal obligation of the Christian faith on the part of mankind is to believe in the Lord. For to believe in Him brings about a conjunction with Him, which makes salvation possible. Moreover, to believe in Him is to be confident that He will save. And because to have this confidence is possible only to someone who lives right, therefore this, too, is meant by believing in Him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 36</h4><p>36. The universal of the Christian faith on man's part is that he should believe on the Lord. For by believing on Him conjunction with Him is effected and this is the means of salvation. To believe on Him is to have trust that He will save: and because no one can have such trust but he who lives a good life, therefore, this also is meant by believing on Him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 36</h4><p>36. The Universal of the Christian Faith on the part of man is that he believe in the Lord, for through believing in Him there is effected conjunction with Him, by which comes salvation. To believe in Him is to have confidence that He will save, and as no one can have this confidence except one who lives aright, therefore this also is meant by believing in Him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 36 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>36. Universale Fidei christianae a parte hominis est, ut credat in Dominum; nam per credere in Ipsum fit conjunctio cum Ipso, per quam salvatio. Credere in Ipsum est fiduciam habere quod Ipse salvet: et quia fiduciam habere non potest nisi qui bene vivit, ideo etiam hoc per credere in Ipsum intelligitur. </p>
