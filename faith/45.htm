<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith45.这就是这信赤裸裸的样子。但凡拥有一点被光照的理性之人，谁在其中看不到违反神性本质本身的荒谬之处？如，神既是爱本身和怜悯本身，能出于愤怒和随之而来的报复诅咒人类，并把他们送进地狱吗？或者，祂愿意因祂的儿子把诅咒担当在自己身上，又因看见祂在十字架上受难和祂的宝血才被感动而施怜悯吗？但凡拥有一点被光照的理性之人，谁看不出神不可能对另一个与祂同等的神说：“我不会原谅他们，但我会把你的功德转稼给他们。”或说“现在让他们随心所欲地生活吧；只要他们相信这一点，就会得救。”此外还有其它许多荒谬之处。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 45</h4><p>45. This is that faith in stark naked form. Can anyone whose reason is at all enlightened fail to see in it absurd notions that run counter to the divine essence itself? For example, there is the notion that a God who is love itself and mercy itself could be moved by rage and vengefulness to damn us and consign us to hell. There is the notion that God chose to be moved to mercy by transferring the damnation to his Son and by gazing at his suffering on the cross and his blood.<p>Can anyone whose reason is at all enlightened fail to see that no God worthy of the name could say, “I do not pardon them, but I am transferring your merit to them”? Or even, “Now let them live as they wish and they will be saved as long as they believe this”? And so on. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 45</h4><p>45. This is that faith in its basic elements. Who with any enlightened reason does not see the absurdity in it, which is contrary to the very essence of Divinity? Consider, for example, the idea that God, who is love itself and mercy itself, could have been moved by anger and thus a desire for retribution to damn human beings and consign them to hell. Or that He is willing to be moved to mercy by the Son’s taking their damnation on Himself, and by His beholding the Son’s suffering upon the cross and seeing His blood.<p>Who with any enlightened reason does not see that God could not possibly have said to another God His equal, "I do not pardon them, but I will impute to them Your merit"? Or again, "Let them now live as they please. Only let them believe this and they will be saved." And much else. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 45</h4><p>45. Such is that faith in its stark reality. Who that is in any light of reason does not see in it inconsistencies which are contrary to the Divine Essence itself? as, that God, who is Love itself and Mercy itself, could out of anger and consequent vengefulness condemn men and devote them to hell? also that He should desire to be moved to compassion by the condemnation being laid upon His Son, and by beholding His passion on the cross and His blood? Who that is in any light of reason does not see that God could not say to a God who was His equal, I do not pardon them, but I impute to them thy merit? as also, Now let them live as they please: only let them believe this and they shall be saved? besides many other inconsistencies. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 45</h4><p>45. Such is that faith in its nakedness. Who that possesses any enlightened reason does not see in it absurdities that are contrary to the Divine essence itself? As for instance that God, who is love itself, and mercy itself, could out of anger and its consequent revengefulness condemn men and accurse them to hell. Or again, that He wills to be moved to mercy by His Son's taking upon Him their condemnation, and by the sight of His suffering upon the cross, and of His blood. Who that possesses any enlightened reason does not see that the Deity could not say to another coequal Deity, "I do not pardon them, but I impute to them Thy merit?" Or, "Now let them live as they please; only let them believe this and they shall be saved." Besides many other absurdities. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 45 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>45. Haec est fides illa in sua nuditate. Quisnam, cui aliqua ratio illustrata est, in illa non videt paradoxa, quae contra ipsam Divinam essentiam sunt? Ut, quod Deus, qui est ipse Amor, et ipsa Misericordia, potuerit ex ira et inde vindicta damnare homines, et devovere illos inferno: tum, quod velit ad misericordiam moveri per damnationem Filio impositam, et per intuitionem Ejus passionis super cruce et Ejus sanguinis. Quis, cui aliqua ratio illustrata est, non videt quod Deus ad Deum aequalem non dicere potuerit, "Non condono illis, sed imputo illis tuum meritum?" ut et, "Nunc vivant sicut velint, modo illud credant, et salvabuntur?" Praeter plura. </p>
