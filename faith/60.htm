<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之信仰篇》 第60节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith60.下一章（启示录13章）论述了龙的两个兽，只见一个从海中上来（13:1-10），一个从地中上来（13:11-18）。它们是龙的兽，这一点从该章第2，4节和11节明显看出来。第一个兽表示与仁分离之信，是在取自属世人的对它的确认方面的；另一个兽也表示与仁分离之信，是在取自圣言的对它的确认，也就是对真理的歪曲方面的。由于对这些经文的解释就反映了那些处于这信之人的推理路线，并且详细阐述它们会过于冗长，所以我在此略过，只解释最后一节，即：</p>
<p>凡有聪明的，可以算计兽的数目，因为这是人的数目。他的数目是六百六十六。（启示录13:18）</p>
<p>“凡有聪明的，可以算计兽的数目”表示那些被光照的人要检查取自圣言的对这信的确认的性质；“因为这是人的数目”表示这些确认的性质就是自我聪明的性质，或说这些确认与自我聪明具有相同的性质；“他的数目是六百六十六”表示圣言的一切真理都被歪曲了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 60</h4><p>60. In the next chapter of Revelation, chapter <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">13</a>, the subject is the dragon’s two beasts, the one that was seen rising up out of the sea and the one that was seen rising up out of the earth. Verses <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">1-10</a> are about the first and verses <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_11.htm">11-18</a> about the second. We can see from verses <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_4.htm">4</a>, and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_11.htm">11</a> that these are the dragon’s beasts. The first beast means faith divorced from caring with respect to the confirmations it draws from the earthly self, and the second means faith divorced from caring with respect to the confirmations it draws from the Word, which are in fact distortions of the truth. I will forgo an explanation of all this, though, since these verses reflect the lines of reasoning [of those devoted to faith divorced from caring], and require a great deal of verbiage to expound. [I will limit myself to] the last one: “Let those who understand calculate the number of the beast. It is the number of a human being; its number is six hundred and sixty-six” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_18.htm">Revelation 13:18</a>). “Let those who understand calculate the number of the beast” means that those who are enlightened should examine the nature of the confirmations of that faith that have been drawn from the Word. “It is the number of a human being” means that those confirmations are of the same nature as the self-centered understandings [of those who hold that faith]; and “its number is six hundred and sixty-six” means that it is a distortion of everything true in the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 60</h4><p>60. In chapter thirteen, which follows next in the book of Revelation, the subject is the dragon’s two beasts, one of which was seen rising up out of the sea, and one that was seen coming up out of the earth. The first beast is described in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1-10</a>, and the second in verses <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_11.htm">Revelation 13:11-18</a>. That they are the dragon’s beasts is apparent from verses 2, 4, and 11 there.<p>The first beast symbolizes faith divorced from charity based on arguments for it springing from people’s natural self. And the second beast symbolizes faith divorced from charity based on arguments for it drawn from the Word, which are also falsifications of truth.<p>But I omit to provide an exposition of these, because they contain those people’s various arguments, which would be much too lengthy to present in any detail. I will explain only this verse:<p>Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and its number is 666. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_18.htm">Revelation 13:18</a>)<p>"Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast" symbolically means, let people who have some enlightenment investigate the nature of the arguments for that faith in the light of the Word. "For it is the number of a man" symbolically means that the nature of these arguments is one of people’s own intelligence. "And its number is 666" symbolizes every truth in the Word falsified. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 60</h4><p>60. The next chapter in the REVELATION, the thirteenth, treats of the dragon's two beasts, one of which was seen to rise out of the sea, and the other out of the earth: the former is treated of from verses <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">1-10</a>, and the latter from verses <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_11.htm">11-18</a>. That they are the dragon's beasts is evident from verses <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_4.htm">4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_11.htm">11</a> of this chapter. By the first beast is signified faith separated from charity, as to the confirmations of it drawn from the natural man; and by the second is signified faith separated from charity, as to the confirmations of it drawn from the Word, which are, moreover, falsifications of the truth. But I pass over the explanation of these passages because they contain argumentations, which it would be too tedious to draw out at length. I will only explain the concluding verse:<p>Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred, threescore and six. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_18.htm">Apocalypse 13:18</a>)<p>Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast, signifies, let those who are enlightened inquire into the nature of the confirmations of that faith drawn from the Word. For it is the number of a man, signifies that its nature is that of self-intelligence. And its number is six hundred and sixty-six, signifies that every truth of the Word is falsified. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 60</h4><p>60. The next chapter (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Apocalpyse 13</a>) treats of the dragon's two beasts, the first seen coming up out of the sea, in verses 1-10, and the other one out of the earth, in verses 11-18. That these are the dragon's beasts is evident from verses 2, 4, and 11. The first beast signifies faith separated from charity in respect to confirmations of it from the natural man. The other beast signifies faith separated from charity in respect to confirmations of it from the Word, which also are falsifications of truth. As the exposition of these passages contains the argumentations of those who are in such faith, and would be too tedious if set forth in detail, I pass it by, and merely give the exposition of the concluding words: <p>He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_13_18.htm">Apocalpyse 13:18</a>). <p>"He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast," signifies that those who are in enlightenment examine the nature of the confirmations of that faith manufactured from the Word; "for it is the number of a man," signifies that the nature of these confirmations is one of self-intelligence; "and his number is six hundred and sixty-six," signifies all the truth of the Word in a falsified condition. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 60 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>60. In capite 13. sequente in Apocalypsi agitur de binis bestiis draconis; de una quae visa est ex mari ascendisse, et de altera quae visa est ex terra ascendisse; de priore agitur a versu 1-10, et de posteriore a versu 11-18; quae quod sint bestiae draconis, patet a versibus 2, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_60/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_13_4">4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_60/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_13_11">11</a>, ibi. Per primam bestiam significatur fides separata a charitate quoad confirmationes ejus ex naturali homine; et per alteram significatur fides separata a charitate quoad confirmationes ejus ex Verbo, quae etiam sunt falsificationes veri. Sed praetereo illa explicare, quia continent argumentationes eorum, quae prolixius diducendae forent; solum ultimum hoc, <p>"Habens intelligentiam computet numerum bestiae, numerus enim hominis est, et numerus ejus sexcenta sexaginta sex" (vers. 18): <p>"habens intelligentiam computet numerum bestiae," significat qui in illustratione sunt, inquirant quale confirmationum istius fidei ex Verbo; "numerus enim hominis est," significat quod sit quale propriae intelligentiae; "et numerus ejus sexcenta sexaginta et sex," significat omne verum Verbi falsificatum. </p>
