<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith48.当这些事和其它类似的事被一个理解力因其宗教而被关闭的人接受时，他在其中进行敬拜的圣殿或教堂，不就好比一个兽穴或地下洞穴吗？在那里，他不知道自己看见的东西是什么。他的宗教不就好比住在一座没有窗户的房子里，其敬拜的声音好比噪音，而不是言语吗？天堂天使不可能与这样的人交谈，因为双方都不懂对方的语言。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 48</h4><p>48. When people whose understanding has been closed because of their religion accept these and similar beliefs, can’t we compare the church in which they worship to a cave or underground grotto where they do not know what they are seeing? And can’t we compare their religion to living in a house without windows and the voice of their worship to noise rather than speech?<p>Heaven’s angels cannot talk with people like this because neither side understands the language of the other. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 48</h4><p>48. When these and other ideas like them are accepted by a person whose intellect has been closed by religion, may not the temple in which he worships be likened then to a cave or underground cavern in which he does not know what it is he is seeing? And may not his religion be likened to living in a house without any windows? And his worshipful utterances to mere sound and not real speech?<p>No angel can converse with anyone like that, because neither one understands what the other is saying. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 48</h4><p>48. When these things, and others like them, are received by a man whose understanding has been closed up by his religious views, may not the temple in which he performs worship be compared to a den or cavern underground, where he does not know what the objects are which he sees? May not his religion be compared to living in a house in which there are no windows? and the language employed in his worship to sound and not to speech? With such a man an angel of heaven cannot converse, because the one does not understand the speech of the other. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 48</h4><p>48. When these things and others like them are received by a man whose understanding has been closed up by his religion, may not the temple in which he performs his worship be compared to a den or cavern underground, where he does not know what the objects are of which he catches sight? And may not his religion be compared to dwelling in a house that has no windows? and the voice of his worship to sound, and not to speech? With such a man an angel of heaven can hold no converse, because the one does not understand the language of the other. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 48 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>48. Cum talia et similia alia recipiuntur ab homine, cui ex religione occlusus est intellectus, annon tunc templum, in quo cultum agit, comparari potest speluncae seu cavernae sub terris, ubi quae videt, nescit quid sunt? ac religio ejus comparari potest habitationi in domo, in qua non sunt fenestrae et vox cultus ejus sono, et non loquelae? Cum tali homine non potest angelus caeli loqui, quia unus non intelligit loquelam alterius, </p>
