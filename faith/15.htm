<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith15.这个顺序就像意愿的一切通过理解力进入身体行为的顺序。没有理解力，意愿不会从自己产生任何东西；没有意愿，理解力也不会从自己产生任何东西。为叫某种东西可以存在，两者必须联合行动。或也可说：属于意愿的情感若不通过属于理解力的思维，就不会从自己产生任何东西，反之亦然；为叫某种东西可以存在，它们必须联合行动。请认真想一想：若从思维中拿走属于某种爱的一切情感，你还能思考吗？若从情感中拿走一切思维，你还能被任何东西打动吗？或也可说，若从思维中拿走情感，你还能说话吗？若从情感中拿走思维或理解力，你还能做什么？仁与信也是如此。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 15</h4><p>15. This sequence is like the sequence of everything that starts in our will and moves through our understanding into the actions of our bodies. Our will accomplishes nothing on its own apart from our understanding, nor does our understanding on its own apart from our will. They need to act together for anything to happen.<p>That is to say, a motivating feeling, which comes from our will, has no effect on its own except by means of thought, which is an activity of our faculty of understanding; and the converse holds true as well. They must act together for anything to happen.<p>Think it through. If you empty thinking of any feeling that comes from some love, can you think? Or by the same token, if you deprive a motivating feeling of its thought, can you accomplish anything? Or again, if you empty thought of its motivating feeling, can you talk, or if you deprive a motivating feeling of its thinking or understanding, can you do anything?<p>That is how it is with caring and faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 15</h4><p>15. The progression of these elements is like the progression of all that the will intends, operating through the intellect, into physical actions.<p>The will produces nothing of itself apart from the intellect, nor does the intellect produce anything of itself apart from the will. They have to function in union to produce any result.<p>Or to put it another way: An affection, which is a property of the will, produces nothing of itself, but does so only through thought, which is a property of the intellect. And conversely. They have to function in union to produce any result.<p>Consider: If from thought you eliminate any affection which is the property of some love, can you entertain any thought? Or if from affection you eliminate any thought, can you be affected by anything? Or to say the equivalent, if from thought you eliminate affection, would you be able to speak? Or if from affection you eliminate thought or the intellect, would you be able to do anything?<p>It is the same with charity and faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 15</h4><p>15. The progression of these in their series is like the progression of all things belonging to the will through the understanding into acts in the body. The will produces nothing from itself without the understanding, and the understanding nothing from itself without the will: they must act in conjunction in order that anything may exist. Or, what is the same: affection which is of the will, produces nothing from itself except by means of thought, which is of the understanding; and conversely: they must act in conjunction in order that anything may exist. For consider: if from thought you remove the affection which is related to some love or other, can you think? or if from affection you remove thought, can you be affected by anything? or, what is the same, if from thought you remove affection, can you speak? or if from affection you remove thought or understanding, can you do anything? It is the same with charity and faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 15</h4><p>15. The progression of these things is precisely like that of all things of the will through the understanding into bodily acts. The will brings forth nothing from itself apart from the understanding, nor does the understanding bring forth anything from itself apart from the will. In order that anything may come forth into manifest being, the two must act in conjunction. Or, what is the same: Affection, which belongs to the will, brings forth nothing from itself except by means of thought, which is of the understanding (the converse also being true), for in order that anything may come forth into manifest being the two must act in conjunction. For consider: If you take away from thought all affection belonging to some love, can you exercise thought? Or if from the affection you take away all thought, are you then able to be affected by anything? Or, what is much the same, if you take away affection from thought, can you speak anything? Or if you take away thought or understanding from affection, can you do anything? It is the same with charity and faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 15 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>15. Progressio illorum est, quemadmodum est progressio omnium voluntatis per intellectum in actus in corpore. Voluntas nihil producit ex se absque intellectu, nec intellectu, aliquid ex se absque voluntate; agent in conjunctione ut aliquid existat. Seu quod idem; affectio quae est voluntatis, nihil producit ex se nisi per cogitationem quae est intellectus, nec vicissim; agent in conjunctione ut aliquid existat. Expende, si a cogitatione removeas affectionem, quae est alicujus amoris, num potes cogitare? aut si ab affectione removeas cogitationem, num potes affici aliqua re? aut, quod simile, si a cogitatione removeas affectionem, num poteris loqui? vel si ab affectione removeas cogitationem seu intellectum, num poteris agere aliquid? Simile est cum charitate et fide. </p>
