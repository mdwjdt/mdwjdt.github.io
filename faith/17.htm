<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith17.从刚才所述明显可知：仁在它是对良善或功用的情感的程度内而产生作为方法的信，它通过这信可以显示存在；因此，仁与信在履行功用中联合行动；信不是从它自己，而是从仁产生良善或功用；因为信就是处于中间阶段的仁，或运作方法上的仁。所以，信产生良善，如同树结出果实是一个谬论。树不是信，树是人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 17</h4><p>17. We can see from what has now been said that caring, to the extent that it is a prompting to do something good, something of use, brings forth faith as its means, through which it becomes manifest. This means that to bring forth something of use, caring and faith must act together.<p>It also means that faith does not accomplish anything good or useful by itself, but only from caring as its source. Faith, in fact, is just caring in its middle phase, so it is a fallacy to think that faith brings forth what is good the way a tree brings forth fruit. The tree is not faith; the tree is the person. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 17</h4><p>17. From what we have now said, it is apparent that, insofar as it is an affection for goodness or useful application, charity produces faith as the means by which to find expression; consequently, that charity and faith function in union in carrying out useful endeavors.<p>It is also apparent that faith does not produce goodness or useful application of itself, but is prompted to do so by charity; for faith is charity intermediated. It is a fallacy, therefore, to suppose that faith produces goodness as a tree does fruit. The tree is not faith. Rather the tree is the person. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 17</h4><p>17. From what has now been said it is evident that charity, so far as it is the affection of good or of use, produces faith as the means by which it may manifest itself; consequently, that charity and faith act conjointly in performing uses; and also that faith does not produce good or use from itself, but from charity; for faith is charity as to its means of operation. It is therefore a fallacy to suppose that faith produces good as a tree does fruit. The tree is not faith, but man is the tree. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 17</h4><p>17. From what has now been said it is evident that charity, insofar as it is the affection of good or of use, brings forth faith as a means through which it may come into manifest being; and therefore that charity and faith, in working uses, act in conjunction; and also that faith does not bring forth good or use from itself, but from charity, for faith is charity in its mediate stage. It is therefore a fallacy that faith brings forth good as a tree does its fruit. The tree is not faith. The tree is the man himself. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 17 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>17. Ex nunc dictis patet quod charitas, quatenus est affectio boni seu usus, producat fidem, ut medium, per quam existat; consequenter, quod charitas et fides, in operando usus, conjunctim agant. Tum quod fides non producat bonum seu usum ex se, sed ex charitate, fides enim est charitas media. Fallacia itaque est, quod fides producat bonum sicut arbor fructum; arbor non est fides, sed arbor est homo. </p>
