<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith50.那些处于信，未处于仁的人属于“非利士”，这一点从圣言中论到非利士人的各种话的灵义，从他们与亚伯拉罕和以撒的仆人争竞（记载于创世记21章和26章），以及他们与以色列人的战争（记载于士师记，撒母耳记和列王纪）明显看出来；因为就灵义而言，圣言中所描述的一切战争都涉及并表示属灵的战争。由于这种宗教，即与仁分离之信，不断渴望入侵教会，所以非利士人继续留在迦南地，并经常骚扰以色列人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 50</h4><p>50. From various things that the Word, when spiritually understood, tells us about the Philistines, we can determine that they are those who are devoted to faith but not to caring. This we can tell both from their arguments with the servants of Abraham and Isaac in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_21_1.htm">Genesis 21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_26_1.htm">26</a>, and from their wars with the children of Israel in Judges, Samuel, and Kings. In fact, all the wars described in the Word have a spiritual meaning; they reflect and symbolize spiritual wars. And since this form of religion, which is one of faith divorced from caring, is constantly trying to invade the church, the Philistines remained in the land of Canaan and often attacked the children of Israel. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 50</h4><p>50. That adherents of Philistia are those who have faith and not charity can be seen from various things said about the Philistines in the Word when understood in its spiritual sense. It can be seen both from their quarrels with the servants of Abraham and Isaac, described in Genesis 21 and Genesis 26, and from their wars with the children of Israel, described in the book of Judges and in the books of Samuel and Kings. For wars in the spiritual sense of the Word all involve and symbolize spiritual wars. And because this religion, which is one of faith divorced from charity, continually endeavors to invade the church, therefore the Philistines remained in the land of Canaan and harassed the children of Israel again and again. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 50</h4><p>50. That they are of Philistia who are in faith and not in charity may appear from various things which are said of the Philistines in the Word, when understood in the spiritual sense: as from their disputes with the servants of Abraham and Isaac, which are recorded in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_21_1.htm">Genesis 21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_22_1.htm">22</a>, and from their wars with the Children of Israel, recorded in the Book of Judges, and in the Books of Samuel and Kings; for all the wars described in the Word in their spiritual sense involve and signify spiritual wars. Moreover, because this religious persuasion, which consists of faith separated from charity, continually desires to invade the Church, therefore the Philistines remained in the land of Canaan, and frequently molested the Children of Israel. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 50</h4><p>50. That they belong to Philistia who are in faith and not in charity, is evident from various things said in the Word about the Philistines, when understood in the spiritual sense, as well from their strife with the servants of Abraham and of Isaac (recorded in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_21_1.htm">Genesis 21</a> and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_26_1.htm">Genesis 26</a>), as from their wars with the sons of Israel (recorded in the book of Judges, and in the books of Samuel and of Kings); for in the spiritual sense all the wars described in the Word involve and signify spiritual wars. And as this religion, namely, faith separated from charity, is continually desiring to get into the church, the Philistines remained in the land of Canaan, and often harried the sons of Israel. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 50 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>50. Quod illi ex Philisthaea sint qui in fide et non in charitate, constare potest ex variis quae de illis in Verbo dicuntur, in spirituali sensu intellectis; tam ex altercationibus illorum cum Abrahami et Isaci servis (de quibus Genes. xxi. et xxvi.), quam ex bellis illorum cum filiis Israelis (de quibus in Libro Judicium ac in Libris Samuelis et Regum); omnia enim bella in Verbo descripta in sensu spirituali involvunt et significant bella spiritualia; et quia hoc religiosum, quod est fidei separatae a charitate, continue vult invadere ecclesiam, ideo Philisthaei manserunt in terra Canaane, et filios Israelis crebro infestarunt. </p>
