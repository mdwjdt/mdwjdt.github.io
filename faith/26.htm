<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith26.然而，每个人不仅为了世上的生活关注功用，还必须为了天上的生活关注它们，因为结束世上的生活后，他就会进入这种生活，并在其中活到永远。因此，每个人自童年开始便从圣言，或教会的教义，或讲道为自己获取关于真理和良善的知识或认知，这些知识或认知关系到他的永生。他照着求知欲，或对知道的情感而把它们或大量或少量地储存在他的属世记忆中；求知欲或对知道的情感是他与生俱来的，并通过各种刺激而得以强化。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 26</h4><p>26. Since we all not only look toward what is useful for our lives in this world but should also look toward what is useful for our lives in heaven (after all, we will get there after life in this world, and that is where we will go on living forever), from our childhood we acquire some familiarity with what is good and true from the Word, from the teachings of the church, or from sermons, and this knowledge is relevant to our eternal life. We store this away in our earthly memory, in greater or lesser abundance depending on our own desire to know, a desire that is both inborn and reinforced by various stimuli. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 26</h4><p>26. However, because everyone has in mind not only endeavors of use for life in the world, but also endeavors of use for life in heaven — inasmuch as he will enter into that life after life in the world, and after life in the world will live in that life to eternity — therefore everyone from childhood acquires for himself concepts of truth and goodness from the Word, or from church doctrine, or from sermons, concepts which will serve him for that life, and he stores these in his natural memory, in a greater or lesser amount, depending on the affection for knowing inborn in him and increased by various inducements. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 26</h4><p>26. Yet every man does not regard uses solely for the sake of life in this world. He must also regard them for the sake of life in heaven, for he will enter into this after his life in the world, and will live therein to eternity. Therefore, every one from his childhood acquires for himself from the Word, or from the doctrine of the Church, or from preaching, cognitions of what is true and good which will be of service in that life. This knowledge he stores up in his natural memory in larger or smaller measure according to his innate love of knowing, and according as this is increased by various incentives. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 26</h4><p>26. But as every man not only regards uses for the sake of life in this world, but also should regard uses for the sake of his life in heaven (for into this life he will come after his life here, and will live in it to eternity), therefore from childhood everyone acquires knowledges [cognitiones] of truth and good from the Word, or from the doctrine of the church, or from preaching, which knowledges are to be learned and retained for the sake of that life; and these he stores up in his natural memory in greater or less abundance according to such affection of knowing as may be inborn with him, and has in various ways been incited to an increase. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 26 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>26. Sed quia omnis homo non modo spectat usus pro vita in mundo, sed etiam spectabit usus pro vita in caelo, (in hanc enim post vitam in mundo veniet, et in hac post illam vivet in aeternum,) ideo quisque a pueritia comparat sibi cognitiones veri et boni ex Verbo, aut ex doctrina ecclesiae, aut ex praedicatione, quae pro illa vita erunt, et reponit illas in memoria naturali, in majore aut minore copia secundum affectionem sciendi connatam, et per varia excitamenta auctam. </p>
