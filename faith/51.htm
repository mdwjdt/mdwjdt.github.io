<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith51.非利士人因代表那些处于与仁分离之信的人，故被称为“未受割礼的”。未受割礼的表示那些没有属灵之爱，因而仅处于属世之爱的人，因为属灵之爱就是仁。这些人之所以被称为未受割礼的，是因为受割礼的表示那些处于属灵之爱的人。至于非利士人被称为未受割礼的，可参看撒母耳记（上17:26，36；下1:20）和其它地方。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 51</h4><p>51. Since the Philistines represented people devoted to a faith divorced from caring, they were called “uncircumcised, ” and “uncircumcised” means lacking in spiritual love and therefore having only earthly love. Spiritual love is caring.<p>The reason they were called uncircumcised is that “the circumcised” means those who are devoted to spiritual love. On the Philistines being called “the uncircumcised,” see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_17_26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_17_36.htm">36</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_1_20.htm">2 Samuel 1:20</a>; and elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 51</h4><p>51. Since the Philistines represented people whose faith is divorced from charity, they were for that reason called uncircumcised, meaning people lacking any spiritual love and so motivated only by some natural love. Charity is a spiritual love.<p>The Philistines were called uncircumcised because the circumcised mean people possessing a spiritual love. To be shown that the Philistines were called uncircumcised, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_17_26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_17_36.htm">36</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_1_20.htm">2 Samuel 1:20</a>, and elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 51</h4><p>51. Because the Philistines represented those who are in faith separated from charity, therefore they were called the Uncircumcised. By the uncircumcised are meant those who are without spiritual love and consequently are in natural love only, for spiritual love is charity. The reason why these were called the Uncircumcised is because by the Circumcised are meant those who are in spiritual love. That the Philistines were called the Uncircumcised may be seen in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_17_26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_17_36.htm">36</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_1_20.htm">2 Samuel 1:20</a>; and in other places. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 51</h4><p>51. As the Philistines represented those who are in faith separated from charity, they were called "the uncircumcised," by whom are meant those who are devoid of spiritual love, and consequently are in natural love only: spiritual love is charity. The reason such were called the uncircumcised is that by the circumcised are meant those who are in spiritual love. (That the Philistines are called the "uncircumcised," see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_17_26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/1-samuel_17_36.htm">36</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-samuel_1_20.htm">2 Samuel 1:20</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 51 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>51. Quoniam Philisthaei repraesentabant illos qui in fide separata charitate sunt, ideo vocati sunt "praeputiati;" et per "praeputiatos" intelliguntur qui absque amore spirituali sunt, et inde in solo amore naturali; amor spiritualis est charitas. Causa quod hi "praeputiati" dicti sint, est quia per "circumcisos" intelliguntur qui in amore spirituali sunt. <p>(Quod Philisthaei "praeputiati" dicti sint, videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_51/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_1-samuel_17_26">1 Samuelis 17:26</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_51/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_1-samuel_17_36">36</a>; <sup>1</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_51/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-samuel_1_20">2 Samuelis 1:20</a>; <sup>2</sup>et alibi. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>"1. 26 pro ""27"""<br> <br>"2. i. pro ""ii.""" </p>
