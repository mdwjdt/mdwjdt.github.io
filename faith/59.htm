<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith59.对这些话的解释如下：</p>
<p>“天上现出大异象来”表示主关于未来教会和对其教义的接受，以及那些将攻击它之人的启示；“有一个妇人，身披日头，脚踏月亮”表示一个拥有来自主的爱和信的教会；“头戴十二星的冠冕”表示那些属于该教会的人将拥有来自神性真理的智慧和聪明；“她怀了孩子”表示它的新生教义；“在生产的阵痛中疼痛呼叫”表示那些处于与仁分离之信的人的抵制；“天上又现出异象来”表示进一步的启示；“看哪，有一条大红龙”表示与仁分离之信，这龙因纯属世之爱而被称为“红”；“七头”表示对圣言的歪曲理解；“十角”表示它因被许多人接受而具有的能力；“七头上戴着七个冠冕”表示被歪曲的圣言真理；“他的尾巴拖拉着天上星辰的三分之一，把它们摔在地上”表示对真理的一切知识的摧毁。“龙就站在那将要生产的妇人面前，等她生产之后，要吞吃她的孩子”表示他们对该教会教义的仇恨，以及在这教义诞生时摧毁它的意图；“妇人生了一个男孩子”表示教义；“是将来要用铁杖牧放列族的”表示该教义将凭源于属灵真理的属世真理的能力而令人信服；“她的孩子被提到神和祂宝座那里去了”表示主从天堂对该教义的保护。“妇人就逃到旷野”表示在少数人中间的教会；“在那里有神给她预备的地方”表示它的状态具有这种性质：在此期间，它可提供给许多人；“使他们在那里养活她一千二百六十天”表示直到它成长到指定状态。“在天上就有了争战：米迦勒同他的使者与龙争战；龙也同它的使者去争战”表示那些处于与仁分离之信的人同那些处于关于主和仁爱生活的教会教义之人的分歧和争战；“他们并没有得胜”表示他们，即那些处于唯信的人被打败了；“天上再没有他们的地方”表示他们从那里被扔了下去。“龙见自己被摔在地上，就逼迫那生了儿子的妇人”表示该教会因其教义而遭受那些处于与仁分离之信的人攻击。“于是有大鹰的两个翅膀赐给妇人，叫她能飞到旷野，到自己的地方”表示当该教会尚在极少数人中间时的谨言慎行；“她在那里被养活一载二载半载，躲避那蛇的面”表示直到该教会成长到指定状态。“蛇就在妇人后面，从口中吐出水来像河一样，要使这河吞没她”表示他们那基于旨在摧毁教会的虚假的大量推理。“地却帮助妇人，那地开口吞了那龙从口中吐出来的河”表示他们的推理因基于虚假，故自己就崩溃了。“龙向妇人发怒，去与她其余的种争战”表示他们持久的仇恨；“就是那守神诫命，为耶稣基督作见证的”表示反对那些过着仁爱生活，并信主的人。</p>
