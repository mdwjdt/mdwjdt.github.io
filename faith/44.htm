<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">六、与仁分离之信的性质</h4><p>Faith44.为说明与仁分离之信的真正性质是什么，我要把它赤裸裸地阐述如下：父神向人类发怒，把他们从祂面前赶走，出于公义决心通过永远诅咒他们而复仇。祂对儿子说：“下去，成全律法，把注定给他们的诅咒担在你自己身上；这样或许我会施怜悯。”于是，圣子降临，成全了律法，让自己被挂在十字架上受苦，并被残忍地处死。当这一切成就时，祂回到父那里说：“我已经把人类的诅咒担在自己身上了，所以请发怜悯吧。”就这样，祂为他们代求。但祂得到的答复是：对他们，我不能；但我因看见你在十字架上，然后又看见你的血，所以被感动以至于同情。然而，我不会原谅他们，但会把你的功德转稼给他们，不过，只转稼给那些承认这一点的人。这将成为他们的得救之信。”</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 44</h4><p>44. The Nature of a Faith Divorced from Caring<p>TO show what faith divorced from caring is really like, I need to present it stark naked. This is how it looks.<p>God the Father, outraged by the human race, rejected it from himself and for reasons of justice decided to get even by damning it forever. Then he said to the Son, “Go down, fulfill the law, and take upon yourself the damnation assigned to them. Then perhaps I will have mercy.” So the Son went down, fulfilled the law, and allowed himself to be hung on the cross and brutally murdered. Once this had happened, he went back to the Father and said, interceding for them, “I have taken upon myself the damnation of the human race; now be merciful to them.” The Father answered, though, “I cannot do it for their sakes, but since I saw you on the cross and then saw your blood, I have become merciful. Still, I will not pardon them, but I will credit them with your merit, but only for the people who acknowledge what you have done. This must be the faith through which they can be saved.” </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 44</h4><p>44. The Nature of Faith Divorced from Charity<p>In order to show the nature of faith divorced from charity, I will present it in its basic elements, which are as follows:<p>God the Father, being angry with the human race, banished it from His presence, and moved by justice, decided to exact retribution by damning it to eternity.<p>Moreover, He said to the Son, "Go down, fulfill the Law, and take upon Yourself the damnation to which they are destined. Perhaps then I will take pity."<p>So the Son went down and fulfilled the Law, and He suffered Himself to be crucified and cruelly put to death. Having done that, He returned to the Father and said, "I have taken upon Myself the damnation of the human race. Now be merciful." And in so doing made intercession for them.<p>But He was told in reply, "I cannot be merciful to them. Yet because I beheld You on the cross and saw Your blood then, I have been moved to mercy. Nevertheless, I will not pardon them, but will impute to them Your merit. But only to those who acknowledge this. This must be their faith, which will make possible their salvation." </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 44</h4><p>44. VI. The nature of faith separated from charity<p>In order that it may be seen what the nature of faith is when separated from charity, I will set it forth in its nakedness as follows:<p>God the Father, being angry with mankind, cast them out from His presence, and to satisfy justice resolved to be revenged by their eternal damnation. He said to the Son: Go down, fulfil the Law and take upon thyself the damnation destined for them: and then perchance I will have mercy. Therefore, He descended, fulfilled the Law, and suffered Himself to be hung on the cross, and cruelly put to death.<p>When this was done, He returned to the Father and said, I have taken upon myself the damnation of mankind: now be merciful. Thus, He interceded for them. But He received for answer: For their own sake I cannot; but as I saw thee on the cross and then beheld thy blood, I am moved to compassion. Nevertheless I will not pardon them. I will however, impute to them thy merit, but only to those who acknowledge this. This shall be the faith by which they may be saved. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 44</h4><p>44. THE NATURE OF FAITH THAT IS SEPARATED FROM CHARITY. <p>In order that it may be seen what the character of faith is when separated from charity, I will present it in its nakedness, in which it is as follows: <p>God the Father, being angry with mankind, cast them away from Him, and out of justice resolved to take vengeance by their eternal condemnation and He said to the Son, "Go down, fulfill the law, and take upon Thyself the condemnation destined for them, and then perchance I shall be moved to compassion." Wherefore He came down, and fulfilled the law; and suffered Himself to be hanged on the cross, and cruelly put to death. When this was done, He returned to the Father and said, "I have taken upon Myself the condemnation of mankind, therefore now be merciful;" thus interceding for them But He received for answer, "Toward them I cannot; but as I saw Thee upon the cross, and beheld then Thy blood, I have been moved to compassion. Nevertheless I will not pardon them, but I will impute unto them Thy merit, but to none others than those who acknowledge this. This shall be the faith by which they can be saved." </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 44 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>44. (VI.) QUALIS FIDES SEPARATA A CHARITATE EST. <p>Ut fides separata a charitate videatur qualis est, sistam illam in sua nuditate. In hac talis est:- <p>Quod Deus Pater iratus contra genus humanum, rejecerit illud a Se, et ex justitia statuerit vindicare per ejus damnationem aeternam: et quod dixerit ad Filium, "Descende, imple Legem, ac damnationem illis destinatam in Te suscipe; et tunc forte miserebor." Quare descendit, et implevit Legem, et passus Se suspendi cruce, et immaniter occidi: quo facto, rediit ad Patrem, et dixit, " Damnationem generis humani in Me suscepi; nunc misericors esto," intercedens pro illis. At responsum tulit, "Non possum erga illos; sed quia Te vidi super cruce, et tunc sanguinem tuum, factus sum misericors; at usque non condonabo illis, sed imputabo illis tuum meritum, verum non aliis, quam qui hoc agnoscunt. Hoc erit fides, per quam salvari possunt. </p>
