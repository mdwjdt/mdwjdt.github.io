<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith27.但这一切知识，无论其数量和性质如何，无非是仁之信能从中得以形成的材料库；这信无法形成，除非人避恶如罪。如果他避恶如罪，这些知识就会变成含有属灵生命在里面的信之知识；但如果他不避恶如罪，那么这些知识无非是知识，不会变成含有任何属灵生命</p>
<p>在里面的信之知识。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 27</h4><p>27. All this knowledge, though, no matter how much or how valuable, is nothing more than a resource out of which a caring faith can be formed; and this kind of faith is formed only as we turn our backs on evils because they are sins.<p>If we turn our backs on evils because they are sins, then this knowledge becomes part of our faith, which has some spiritual life in it; but if we do not turn our backs on evils because they are sins, then our knowledge is nothing but knowledge, and does not become part of a faith that has spiritual life within it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 27</h4><p>27. Yet all of these concepts, of whatever number or value, are only a storehouse from which the faith accompanying charity may be formed. And this faith is not formed except insofar as the person refrains from evils as being sins.<p>If he refrains from evils as being sins, then these concepts become ones of faith, in which there is spiritual life. But if he does not refrain from evils as being sins, these concepts are only concepts and not ones of a faith that has any spiritual life in it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 27</h4><p>27. But all these cognitions, whatever their number and nature, are only a store out of which the faith of charity may be formed: and this faith is not formed except in proportion as a man shuns evils as sins. If he shuns evils as sins, then these cognitions become related to a faith in which there is spiritual life. If, however, he does not shun evils as sins, these cognitions are merely cognitions and do not become related to a faith in which there is any spiritual life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 27</h4><p>27. But all these knowledges [cognitiones], whatever may be their number and whatever their nature, are merely the storehouse of material from which the faith of charity can be formed, and this faith cannot be formed except in proportion as the man shuns evils as sins. If he shuns evils as sins, then these knowledges become those of a faith that has spiritual life within it. But if he does not shun evils as sins, then these knowledges are nothing but knowledges [cognitiones], and do not become those of a faith that has any spiritual life within it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 27 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>27. Sed omnes hae cognitiones, quotcunque et qualescunque sunt, modo sunt promptuarium ex quo fides charitatis formari potest; et haec fides non formatur, nisi quantum fugit mala ut peccata. Si fugit mala ut peccata, tunc cognitiones illae fiunt fidei, cui vita spiritualis inest: si autem non fugit mala ut peccata, cognitiones illae non sunt nisi quam cognitiones, et non fiunt fidei cui aliqua vita spiritualis inest. </p>
