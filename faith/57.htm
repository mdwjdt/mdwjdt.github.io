<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith57.由于启示录中的“龙”表示那些处于与仁分离之信的人，还由于迄今为止，这一点不为人知，实际上因缺乏圣言灵义的知识而一直被隐藏，所以有必要在此对启示录第12章论到那龙的话给出一个大体解释。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 57</h4><p>57. Now, since in the Book of Revelation the dragon means people devoted to a faith divorced from caring, and since this has not been known before and has been hidden because the spiritual meaning of the Word has not been recognized, I need to offer at this point an overview of the meaning of what is said about the dragon in the twelfth chapter [of Revelation]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 57</h4><p>57. Now because the dragon in the book of Revelation means people whose faith is divorced from charity, something previously unknown and also hidden, owing to people’s having no concept of the Word’s spiritual sense, therefore we will present here a general exposition of what is said in chapter twelve there regarding the dragon. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 57</h4><p>57. Now since by the dragon in the Revelation are meant those who are in faith separated from charity, and as this has hitherto been unknown and has also remained hidden for want of a knowledge (cognitio) of the spiritual sense of the Word, therefore a general explanation will be given here of what is said concerning the dragon in Revelation 12. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 57</h4><p>57. Inasmuch as the dragon in the Revelation means those who are in faith separated from charity, and as hitherto this has not been known, being indeed actually hidden through a lack of knowledge of the spiritual sense of the Word, a general exposition shall here be given of what is said in the twelfth chapter about the dragon. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 57 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>57. Nunc quia per "draconem" in Apocalypsi intelliguntur qui in fide separata a charitate sunt, et hoc hactenus ignoratum fuit, et quoque occultum ex non cognitione sensus spiritualis Verbi, ideo dabitur hic Explicatio generalis super illa quae in cap. 12 ibi de Dracone dicuntur. </p>
