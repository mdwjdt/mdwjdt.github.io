<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 62</h4><p>62. Reference to the following is needed to show that goats mean people who are devoted to a faith divorced from caring:<p>1. Experience in the spiritual world<p>2. Those on whom the Last Judgment was carried out<p>3. The description of the battle between the ram and the goat in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_4_1.htm">Daniel 4</a>. Lastly, the failure of caring in the people described in Matthew </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 62</h4><p>62. We will show that people whose faith is divorced from charity are meant by goats, first by my experience in the spiritual world, secondly by the people on whom the Last Judgment was carried out, thirdly by the description of the combat between the ram and the goat in Daniel, and lastly by their lack of charity as told in Matthew. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 62</h4><p>62. That they who are in faith separated from charity are meant by goats will be shown:<p>1. From experience in the spiritual world;<p>2. From the Last Judgment and those upon whom it was executed;<p>3. From the description of the combat between the ram and the he-goat in Daniel;<p>4. And lastly, from the neglect of charity on the part of those mentioned in Matthew. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 62</h4><p>62. That those in faith separated from charity are meant by the "goats" shall now be shown. <p>I. From experience in the spiritual world. <p>II. From the Last Judgment, and the character of those upon whom it was executed. <p>III. From the description in Daniel of the combat between the ram and the he-goat. <p>IV. Lastly, from the neglect of charity by those of whom mention is made in Matthew. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 62 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>62. Quod illi qui in fide separata a charitate sunt, per "hircos" intelligantur, demonstrabitur, <p>(i.) Ab experientia in mundo spirituali; <p>(ii.) Ad Ultimo Judicio, super quos peractum est; <p>(iii.) EX descriptione pugnae inter arietem et hircum apud Danielem; <p>(iv.) Et demum ex omissione charitatis illorum, de quibus apud Matthaeum. </p>
