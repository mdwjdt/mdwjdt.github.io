<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith58.在启示录第12章，经上论到那龙说：</p>
<p>天上现出大异象来；有一个妇人，身披日头，脚踏月亮，头戴十二星的冠冕。她怀了孩子，在生产的阵痛中疼痛呼叫。天上又现出异象来。看哪，有一条大红龙，七头十角，七头上戴着七个冠冕。他的尾巴拖拉着天上星辰的三分之一，把它们摔在地上；龙就站在那将要生产的妇人面前，等她生产之后，要吞吃她的孩子。妇人生了一个男孩子，是将来要用铁杖牧放列族的。她的孩子被提到神和祂宝座那里去了。妇人就逃到旷野，在那里有神给她预备的地方，使他们在那里养活她一千二百六十天。在天上就有了争战：米迦勒同他的使者与龙争战；龙也同它的使者去争战，他们并没有得胜；天上再没有他们的地方。龙见自己被摔在地上，就逼迫那生了儿子的妇人。于是有大鹰的两个翅膀赐给妇人，叫她能飞到旷野，到自己的地方，她在那里被养活一载二载半载，躲避那蛇的面。蛇就在妇人后面，从口中吐出水来像河一样，要使这河吞没她。地却帮助妇人，那地开口吞了那龙从口中吐出来的河。龙向妇人发怒，去与她其余的种争战，就是那守神诫命，为耶稣基督作见证的。（启示录12:1-8，13-17）</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 58</h4><p>58. This is what the twelfth chapter of Revelation says about the dragon:<p>And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. And being pregnant, she cried out in labor and in pain to give birth. And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and seven gems on his heads. His tail drew a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, to devour her child as soon as it was born. She bore a male child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her child was caught up to God and his throne. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, so that they would feed her there for one thousand two hundred and sixty days. And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they did not prevail, and no place was found for them in heaven any longer. And when the dragon saw that he had been cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who had given birth to the male child. But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, so that she could fly into the wilderness to her place, where she would be nourished for a time and times and half a time, away from the presence of the serpent. So the serpent spewed water out of his mouth like a flood after the woman, to cause her to be carried away by the flood. But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the flood that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth. And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went away to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

Regarding the dragon, this is what is said in chapter twelve of the book of Revelation:<p>Now a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. Then being with child, she cried out in labor and in pain to give birth. And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great, fiery red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven jewelson its heads. Its tail drew a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to give birth, to devour her child as soon as it was born. She bore a male child who would shepherd all nations with a rod of iron. And her child was caught up to God and His throne. Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they may feed her there one thousand two hundred and sixty days.<p>And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and its angels fought, but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer….<p>When the dragon saw that it had been cast to the earth, it pursued the woman who gave birth to the male child. But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she might be nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the face of the serpent. So the serpent spewed water out of its mouth like a river after the woman, that it might cause her to be swept away by the river. But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon had spewed out of its mouth. And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and it went off to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. (Revelation 12) </p>

In <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_1.htm">Apocalpyse 12</a> it is said: <p>A great sign was seen in heaven, a woman encompassed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars; and she being with child, cried, travailing in birth, and in pain to be delivered. And another sign was seen in heaven and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them into the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered, that when she was delivered, he might devour her child. And she brought forth a man child, who was to pasture all the nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto God, and unto his throne. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they may nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days. And there was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels; and they prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven. And when the dragon saw that he was cast into the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man child. And unto the woman were given two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness into her place, where she would be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood. And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood that the dragon cast out of his mouth. And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went away to make war with the remnant of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and hold the testimony of Jesus Christ (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_1.htm">Apocalpyse 12:1-8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_12_13.htm">13-17</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 58 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>58. De Dracone haec dicuntur in capite 12, in Apocalypsi:- <p>"Et signum magnum visum est in caelo; mulier circumdata sole, et luna sub pedibus ejus, et super capite ejus corona stellarum duodecim; et in utero habens clamavit parturiens, et cruciata parere. Et visum est aliud signum in caelo, et ecce draco magnus rufus, habens capita septem, et cornua septem, et super capitibus suis diademata septem. Et cauda sua traxit tertiam partem stellarum caeli, et projecit illas in terram. Et draco stetit coram muliere paritura, ut postquam pepererat, fetum ejus devoraret. Et peperit filium masculum, qui pasturus est omnes gentes virga ferrea: et raptus es[ fetus ejus ad Deum et thronum Ipsius. Et mulier fugit in desertum, ubi habet locum praeparatum a Deo, ut ibi alant eam diebus mille ducentis sexaginta. Et factum est bellum in caelo, Michael et angeli ejus pugnarunt cum dracone, et draco pugnavit et angeli ejus; et non praevaluerunt; et non locus inventus illorum amplius in caelo... Et cum vidit draco quod projectus in terram, persecutus est mulierem quae peperit filium. Et datae mulieri duae alae aquilae magnae, ut volaret in desertum in locum suum, ubi aleretur ibi tempus et tempora et dimidium tempus, a facie serpentis: et ejecit serpens post mulierem ex ore suo aquam tanquam flumen, ut illam a flumine absorptam faceret: et adjuvit terra mulierem, et aperuit terra os suum, et deglutivit flumen, quod ejecit draco ex ore suo. Et iratus est draco contra mulierem, et abivit facere bellum cum reliquis seminis ejus, observantibus mandata Dei, et habentibus testimonium Jesu Christi" ((vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_58/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_1-8">1-8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_58/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_13-17">13-17</a>)). </p>
