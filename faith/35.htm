<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith35.之所以说普遍概念或形式上的基督信仰，是因为这是信仰的普遍原则；信仰的普遍原则必存在于信仰的一切事物中，无论总体还是细节。这是信仰的一个普遍原则：神在位格和本质上都为一，三位一体在祂里面，主就是这位神。这是信仰的一个普遍原则：若非主降世，没有人能得救。这是信仰的一个普遍原则：主降世是为了将地狱从人那里移走；祂通过与地狱争战，以及对它的胜利而移走它；因此，祂征服地狱，把它归入秩序，并使它服从祂自己。这也是信仰的一个普遍原则：主降世是为了荣耀祂在世上所取的人身，也就是为了把它与作为其源头的神性合一；因此，祂使被祂征服的地狱永远保持在秩序中，并服从祂自己。由于若不通过试探，甚至直到终极试探，也就是十字架受难，这些目的或异能就无法实现，所以祂也承受了这种终极试探。这些就是关于主的基督信仰的普遍原则。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 35</h4><p>35. I refer to this belief as the faith in one all-encompassing view because it is inherent in the faith, and what is inherent in the faith must be present throughout it and in every detail of it.<p>Inherent in this faith is the belief that God, in whom there is a trinity, is one in person and in essence, and that the Lord is God.<p>Inherent in this faith is the belief that no human being could have been saved if the Lord had not come into the world.<p>Inherent in this faith is the belief that the Lord came into the world to move hell away from us and that he moved it away by means of battles against it and victories over it. That is how he gained control over it, brought it back into order, and made it obey him.<p>Also inherent in this faith is the belief that the Lord came into the world to glorify the human nature that he took on in the world—that is, to unite it to the divine nature that was its source. Once he had gained control over hell, this allowed him to keep it in order and obedient to him forever. Since neither of these goals could have been achieved without trials, even to the absolute extreme, and since the absolute extreme was his suffering on the cross, he underwent this.<p>These are beliefs concerning the Lord that are central to the [true] Christian faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 35</h4><p>35. We say, "in a universal formula," because this is a universal expression of the faith, and a universal expression of the faith must be reflected in each and every one of its particulars.<p>It is a universal tenet of the faith that God is one in person and essence, in whom is the Trinity, and that the Lord is that God.<p>It is a universal tenet of the faith that no mortal could have been saved if the Lord had not come into the world.<p>It is a universal tenet of the faith that He came into the world to remove hell from mankind, and that He removed it by battles against it and victories over it. In doing so He conquered it and put it back into order in obedience to Him.<p>It is a universal tenet of the faith that the Lord came into the world to glorify the humanity that He assumed in the world, that is, to unite it to the Divine from which He originated. By this He keeps hell subject to Him to eternity, in order and in obedience to Him.<p>Since neither of these ends could have been achieved other than through temptations or trials even to the last of them, and since the last of them was the suffering of the cross, therefore He underwent even this.<p>These are the universal tenets of the Christian faith regarding the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 35</h4><p>35. This is called the Christian faith in its universal idea because this is the universal of faith, and the universal of faith is that which must be in all things of it, in general and in particular.<p>1. It is a universal of faith that God is one in Person and in Essence, in whom there is a Trinity, and that the Lord is that God.<p>2. It is a universal of faith that no mortal could have been saved unless the Lord had come into the world.<p>3. It is a universal of faith that He came into the world to remove hell from man; that He removed it by combats against it and by victories over it; and that He thus subjugated it, and reduced it to order and under obedience to Himself.<p>4. It is also a universal of faith that He came into the world to glorify the Human which He assumed in the world, that is, to unite it to the originating Divine; and that, having subjugated hell, He thus keeps it in order and under obedience to Himself to eternity. As neither of these purposes could have been effected except by temptations, even to the last of them which was the passion of the cross, He therefore endured that also.<p>These are the universals of the Christian faith concerning the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 35</h4><p>35. It is said "in the universal idea or form" because this is what is universal of the Faith, and what is universal of the Faith is that which must be in all things of it both in general and in particular. It is a Universal of the Faith that God is One in Person and in Essence, in whom is the Trinity, and that the Lord is that God. It is a Universal of the Faith that no mortal could have been saved unless the Lord had come into the world. It is a Universal of the Faith that He came into the world in order to remove hell from man, and He removed it by combats against it and by victories over it; thus He subdued it, and reduced it into order and under obedience to Himself. It is also a Universal of the Faith that He came into the world in order to glorify the Human which He took upon Him in the world, that is, in order to unite it to the all-originating Divine [Divino a Quo]; thus to eternity does He hold in order and under obedience to Himself hell subjugated by Himself. And inasmuch as neither of these mighty works could have been accomplished except by means of temptations even to the uttermost of them, which was the passion of the cross, He therefore underwent this uttermost temptation. These are the Universals of the Christian Faith concerning the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 35 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>35. Dicitur in universali idea, quia hoc est universale fidei, ac universale fidei est quod in omnibus et singulis erit. Universale fidei est, quod Deus sit unus persona et essentia, in quo Trinitas, et quod Dominus sit ille Deus. Universale fidei est, quod nullus mortalium salvari potuerit nisi Dominus in mundum venerit. Universale fidei est, quod in mundum venerit, ut removeret infernum ab homine; et removit illud per pugnas contra illud, et per victorias super illud; ita subjugavit illud; et redegit illud in ordinem et sub suam obedientiam. Universale fidei etiam est, quod in mundum venerit, ut Humanum, quod in mundo suscepit, glorificaret, hoc est, uniret Divino a quo; sic infernum ab Ipso subjugatum in ordine et sub obedientia sua in aeternum tenet. Quoniam utrumque hoc non fieri potuit nisi quam per tentationes usque ad ultimum illarum, ac ultimum illarum fuit passio crucis, ideo illam subivit. Haec sunt Universalia Fidei Christianae de Domino. </p>
