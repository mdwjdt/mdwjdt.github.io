<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">二、对真理的内在承认，也就是信仰，只存在于那些处于仁爱的人里面</h4><p>Faith13.刚才说了什么是信，现在说说什么是仁。就其起源或初始而言，仁就是对良善的情感；由于良善热爱真理，所以对良善的情感会产生对真理的情感，并通过它产生对真理的承认，也就是信。通过这一系列步骤，对良善的情感就逐渐取得形式或显现，并变成仁。这就是仁从它的起源，也就是对良善的情感，通过信，也就是对真理的承认，到它的最后目的，也就是仁的逐步发展。最后的目的就是行动。由此可见，爱，也就是对良善的情感，如何产生信（信与对真理的承认是一回事），并通过这信产生仁（仁与通过信作工的爱是一回事）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 13</h4><p>13. The “Inner Recognition of Truth” That Is Faith Is Found Only in People Who Are Devoted to Caring<p>HAVING just said what faith is, I need now to say what caring is. Caring originates in a desire to do something good. Since what is good loves what is true, this desire leads to a desire for truth and therefore to the recognition of what is true, which is faith. By these steps, in proper sequence, a desire to do something good takes form and turns into caring. This is how caring develops from its origin, which is a desire to do something good, through faith, which is a recognition of what is true, to its goal, which is caring. The goal is the doing of something.<p>We can see from this how love, which is a desire to do something good, brings forth faith, which is the same as recognizing what is true, and by this means brings forth caring, which is the same as love acting through faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 13</h4><p>13. An Internal Acknowledgment of Truth, Namely Faith, Is Possible Only in People Motivated by Charity<p>We said above what faith is. We will now say what charity is. In its first origin charity is an affection for goodness; and because goodness loves truth, it produces an affection for truth, and through that affection an acknowledgment of truth, which is faith. Through this progression the affection for goodness finds expression and becomes charity.<p>This is the progression of charity from its origin, that is, from an affection for goodness, through faith, which is an acknowledgment of truth, to its end, which is charity. The end being the act.<p>It is apparent from this how love, namely an affection for goodness, produces faith, which is the same as an acknowledgment of truth, and through that faith produces charity, which is the same as an act of love through faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 13</h4><p>13. II. An internal acknowledgment of truth, which is faith, cannot exist with any but those who are in charity.<p>It was stated above what faith is; here it will be explained what charity is. Charity in its first origin is the affection of good; and as good loves truth, the affection of good produces the affection of truth, and by the affection of truth, the acknowledgment of truth, which is faith. By these in their series, the affection of truth <sup>1</sup>manifests itself, and becomes charity. This is the progression of charity from its origin, which is the affection of good, through faith which is the acknowledgment of truth, to its end in view, which is charity: its end is action. From these considerations it is evident how love, which is the affection of good, produces faith, which is the same thing as the acknowledgment of truth, and by this produces charity, which is the same thing as the act of love through faith.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;It has been suggested that veri should read boni. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 13</h4><p>13. THE INTERNAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF TRUTH, WHICH IS FAITH, EXISTS WITH NONE BUT THOSE WHO ARE IN CHARITY. <p>We have already said what faith is, and will now say what charity is. In its origin or beginning, charity is the affection of good, and as good loves truth, the affection of good produces the affection of truth, and through it the acknowledgment of truth which is faith. Through this succession, the affection of good <sup>1</sup>comes forth into manifest being, and becomes charity. This is the progressive advance of charity from its origin which is the affection of good, through faith which is the acknowledgment of truth, to its final end in view, which is charity. The final end is the doing. And this shows how love, here the affection of good, produces faith-which is the same thing as the acknowledgment of truth-and through this produces charity - which is the same thing as the working of love through faith. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;The Latin here reads "affection of truth," which is evidently a slip of the pen or else printer's error, as the context shows.

<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 13 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>13. (II.) QUOD AGNITIO INTERNA VERI, QUAE FIDES, NON DETUR APUD ALIOS QUAM QUI IN CHARITATE SUNT. <p>Supra dictum est quid fides: hic dicetur quid charitas. Charitas in sua prima origine est affectio boni; et quia bonum amat verum, producit illa affectionem veri, per hanc agnitionem veri, quae est fides; per has in sua serie affectio <sup>1</sup>veri existit et fit charitas. Haec est progressio charitatis a sua origine, quae est affectio boni, per fidem quae est agnitio veri, ad finem suum qui est charitas; finis est unus. Ex his patet quomodo amor, qui est affectio boni, producit fidem, quae est idem cum agnitione veri, et per hanc producit charitatem, quae est idem cum actu amoris per fidem.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>"1. ""veri"":- sic editio princeps. Forte est legendum boni." </p>
