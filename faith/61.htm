<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">九、那些处于与仁分离之信的人由在但以理书和马太福音中的山羊来表示</h4><p>Faith61.但以理书第8章中的“公山羊”和马太福音第25章中的“山羊”表示那些处于与仁分离之信的人，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：它们站在“公绵羊”和“绵羊”的对立面，而“公绵羊”和“绵羊”表示那些处于仁爱的人。因为在圣言中，主被称为“牧人”，教会被称为“羊圈”，集体的教会之人被称为“羊群”，个体的教会之人被称为“绵羊”。由于“绵羊”是指那些处于仁爱的人，所以“山羊”是指那些未于仁爱的人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 61</h4><p>61. The Goats Mentioned in Daniel and Matthew Symbolize People Devoted to a Faith Divorced from Caring<p>WE can tell that the goat in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_1.htm">eighth chapter</a> of Daniel and the goats in the <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_1.htm">twenty-fifth chapter</a> of Matthew mean people devoted to a faith divorced from caring, because in those passages they are set in contrast to a ram and sheep, and rams and sheep mean people who are devoted to caring. In the Word the Lord is called the Shepherd, the church is called the fold, the people of the church in general are called the flock, and the individuals are called sheep; and since sheep mean people devoted to caring, in these passages goats mean people who are not devoted to caring. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 61</h4><p>61. People Whose Faith Is Divorced from Charity Are Meant by the Goats in Daniel and Matthew<p>The goat in Daniel 8 and the goats in Matthew 25 mean people whose faith is divorced from charity, and this can be seen from the fact that in Daniel the goat is contrasted with a ram, and the goats in Matthew with sheep — the ram and the sheep both meaning people possessing charity. For in the Word the Lord is called a shepherd and the church a sheepfold, and people in the church are collectively called a flock and individually sheep. And because sheep are people who possess charity, therefore goats are people without charity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 61</h4><p>61. IX. They who are in faith separated from charity, are meant by the goats in Daniel and in Matthew.<p>By the he-goat in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8</a>, and by the goats in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25</a>, are meant those who are in faith separated from charity. This may appear from the circumstance that they are opposed to the ram and the sheep there mentioned. By the ram and the sheep are meant those who are in charity: for the Lord in the Word is called the Shepherd, the Church the sheepfold, and men of the Church in general are called the flock, and specifically sheep. Since sheep are those who are in charity, therefore goats are those who are not in charity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 61</h4><p>61. THOSE WHO ARE IN FAITH SEPARATED FROM CHARITY ARE MEANT BY THE "GOATS" IN DANIEL AND IN MATTHEW. <p>That the "he-goat" in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8</a> and the "goats" in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25</a> mean those in faith separated from charity, is evident from the fact that they stand contrasted with the "ram" and the "sheep," by which are meant those who are in charity. For in the Word the Lord is called the "Shepherd," the church the "fold," and the men of the church taken collectively the "flock," and individually, "sheep." And as the "sheep" are those in charity, the "goats" are those who are not in charity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 61 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>61. (IX.) QUOD ILLI QUI IN FIDE SEPARATA A CHARITATE SUNT, INTELLIGANTUR PER "HIRCOS" APUD DANIELEM ET MATTHAEUM. <p>Quod Per "hircum" apud Danielem (cap. 8), et per "hircos" apud Matthaeum (cap. 25), intelligantur illi qui in fide separata a charitate sunt, constare potest ex eo, quod opponantur "arieti" et "ovibus" ibi; et per "arietem" et per "oves" intelliguntur qui in charitate sunt: Dominus enim in Verbo vocatur Pastor; ecclesia ovile; et homines ecclesiae in genere vocantur grex, et in specie oves: et quia "oves" sunt illi qui in charitate sunt, ideo "hirci" sunt illi qui non in charitate. </p>
