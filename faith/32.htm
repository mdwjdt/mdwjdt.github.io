<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之信仰篇》 第32节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith32.我还需要解释一下信是如何从仁中得以形成的。每个人都有一个属世心智和一个属灵心智；属世心智是为了世界，属灵心智是为了天堂。一个人在避开并憎恶如罪的邪恶之前，在理解力方面处于这两个心智，在意愿方面则不然。当他避开并憎恶如罪的邪恶时，他的属灵心智在意愿方面也被打开；当它被打开时，来自天堂的属灵之热便在意愿从它流入属世心智。这热本质上就是仁爱，它给属世心智中的真理和良善的知识或认知带来生命，并从它们当中形成信仰。此处的情形就像一棵树：除非热从太阳流入，并与光结合，如春天里的情形，否则这树不会接受植物的生命。人复活得生命和一棵树的生长之间在这方面有一个完全的相似性，即：树受尘世之热影响，人受天堂之热影响。也正是由于这个原因，主常把人比作一棵树。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 32</h4><p>32. I need to tell also how faith is formed out of caring. Each of us has an earthly mind and a spiritual mind, the earthly mind for this world and the spiritual mind for heaven. We have access to both with respect to our intellect but not with respect to our will, until we turn our backs on evils and reject them because they are sins. When we do this, our spiritual mind is opened with respect to our will as well, and a spiritual warmth from heaven flows into our earthly mind. Essentially, this warmth is caring, and it brings to life our knowledge of what is true and good, a knowledge that is in our earthly mind, and forms a faith out of it. Again, this is like a tree that does not get any vegetative life until warmth from the sun flows into it and unites itself with light, as happens in spring.<p>There is actually a complete parallel between humans coming to life and the sprouting of a tree. The parallel rests on the fact that earthly warmth causes the latter and heavenly warmth causes the former. That is why the Lord so often compared people to trees. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 32</h4><p>32. We must also say how faith is formed in response to charity. Everyone has a natural mind and a spiritual mind — a natural mind for life in the world, and a spiritual mind for life in heaven. A person is present in both worlds with his intellect, but not with his will until he refrains from evils as being sins and turns away from them. When he does this, his spiritual mind then becomes open also for the will. And when it opens, it occasions a spiritual warmth to flow in from heaven into his natural mind, a warmth that in its essence is charity, and it animates the concepts of truth and goodness that he has there and out of them forms faith.<p>The case here is also as that with a tree, which does not have any plant life until warmth flows in from the sun and unites with the light, as happens in springtime.<p>There is also a complete parallel between the animation of a person and the growth of a tree in this respect, that the warmth of heaven occasions the first and the warmth of the world occasions the latter. It is for this reason, too, that the Lord so often likens a person to a tree. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 32</h4><p>32. Further, it will now be explained how faith is formed from charity. Every man has a natural mind and a spiritual mind, a natural mind for the world and a spiritual mind for heaven. Man as to understanding is in both; but not as to his will before he shuns and turns himself away from evils as sins. When he does this, his spiritual mind is then opened with respect to the will also; and when it has been opened, there flows from it into the natural mind spiritual heat from heaven. This heat in its essence is charity and it gives life to the cognitions of truth and good which are in the natural mind, and out of them it forms faith.<p>This is similar to what takes place in a tree. It does not receive vegetative life before heat from the sun flows in and unites with light, as happens in the spring time. There is, moreover, a full parallel between the quickening of man with life and the vegetation of a tree in this respect, that the latter is effected by the heat of this world, and the former by the heat of heaven: for this reason also man is so often likened to a tree by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 32</h4><p>32. We will also say how faith is formed from charity. Every man has a natural mind and a spiritual mind: a natural mind for the world, and a spiritual mind for heaven. In respect to his understanding, man is in both minds, but not in respect to his will, until he shuns and is averse to evils as sins. When he does this his spiritual mind is opened in respect to the will also; and when it has been opened there inflows from it into the natural mind spiritual heat from heaven (which heat in its essence is charity), and gives life to the knowledges of truth and good in the natural mind, and out of them it forms faith. The case here is just as it is with a tree, which does not receive any vegetative life until heat inflows from the sun, and conjoins itself with the light, as takes place in spring time. There is also a full parallelism between the quickening of man with life and the growing of a tree, in this respect, that the latter is effected by the heat of this world, and the former by the heat of heaven. It is for this reason also that man is so often likened by the Lord to a tree. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 32 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>32. Dicetur etiam quomodo formatur fides ex charitate. Cuivis homini est mens naturalis et mens spiritualis; mens naturalis pro mundo, et mens spiritualis pro caelo. Homo quoad intellectum est in utroque; non autem quoad voluntatem, priusquam fugit et aversatur mala ut peccata. Cum hoc facit, tunc aperitur mens spiritualis etiam pro voluntate; qua aperta, influit inde in mentem naturalem calor spiritualis e caelo, qui calor in sua essentia est charitas, ac vivificat cognitiones veri et boni quae ibi sunt, et ex illis format fidem. Fit etiam hoc sicut cum arbore, quae non vitam vegetativam accipit, prius quam calor e sole influit, et conjungit se cum luce, ut fit tempore veris. Plenus etiam parallelismus est inter vivificationem hominis et vegetationem arboris, in eo, quod hanc faciat calor mundi, et illam calor caeli: quare etiam homo toties assimilatur .arbori a Domino. </p>
