<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith30.此外，有许多人没有对真理的一种内在承认，却拥有仁之信。他们就是那些在生活中仰望主，并出于宗教原则避开邪恶，但因世上的忧虑和职业责任，以及缺乏他们教师那一方的真理而没有思想真理的人。但从内心里，也就是在他们的灵里，他们仍处于对真理的承认，因为他们处于对真理的情感；故死后成为灵人并被天使教导时，他们便承认真理，并欢喜接受。而那些没有在生活中仰望主，也没有出于宗教原则避开邪恶的人则截然不同。从内心里，也就是在他们的灵里，他们并未处于对真理的情感，因而处于对真理的承认；故死后成为灵人并被天使教导时，他们不愿承认真理，因而不接受它们。因为生活的邪恶从内在憎恨真理，而生活的良善从内在热爱真理。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 30</h4><p>30. There are many people, too, who do not have an inner recognition of what is true but still have a faith that comes from caring. These are people who have turned toward the Lord in their lives and who have refrained from evil behavior for religious reasons, but who have been hindered from thinking about truths by worldly concerns and by their professional responsibilities as well as by a lack of truth on the part of their teachers. More deeply, or in spirit, though, they are able to recognize what is true, because they are drawn to it; so after they die, become spirits, and are taught by angels, they recognize what is true and are overjoyed to receive it.<p>However, it is different for people who have not turned toward the Lord in their lives and have failed to refrain from evil behavior in accord with their religion. Inwardly or in spirit they do not feel drawn to truth and therefore have no ability to recognize it. So when they become spirits after death and are taught by angels, they are unwilling to acknowledge what is true and therefore do not accept it. Inside an evil life there is a hatred of truth, while inside a good life there is a love for truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 30</h4><p>30. Many people have no internal acknowledgment of truth and yet have the faith that accompanies charity. They are people who have looked to the Lord in their life and have, in accord with religion, avoided evils, but who have been prevented from thinking about truths owing to worldly concerns and dealings, and also to a lack of truth in their teachers. Yet they still have an acknowledgment of truth inwardly or in their spirit, because they have an affection for it. Consequently, after death, when they become spirits and are instructed by angels, they acknowledge truths and receive them with joy.<p>But the case is otherwise with people who have not looked to the Lord in their life and have not, in accord with religion, avoided evils. They have no acknowledgment of truth inwardly or in their spirit and so are without any acknowledgment of it. Consequently, after death, when they become spirits and are instructed by angels, they refuse to acknowledge truths and so do not accept them. For a life of evil inwardly detests truths, whereas a life of goodness inwardly loves them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 30</h4><p>30. There are, moreover, many who do not have an internal acknowledgment of truth, and yet have the faith of charity. They are those who have looked to the Lord in their life, and who from religious principles have avoided evils. But they have been kept from thinking about truths by cares and business in the world, and also by a want of truth on the part of their teachers. Nevertheless, however, they are interiorly, that is, in their spirit, in the acknowledgment of truth, because they are in the affection of it. Therefore, after death, when they become spirits and are instructed by angels, they acknowledge truths and receive them with joy. But it is otherwise with those who in their life have not looked to the Lord, and who have not avoided evils from religious principles. These interiorly, or in their spirit, are not in any affection of truth, and consequently are not in any acknowledgment of it. Therefore, after death, when they become spirits and are instructed by angels, they are unwilling to acknowledge truths and consequently they do not receive them. For evil of life interiorly hates truths, but good of life interiorly loves them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 30</h4><p>30. There are many who possess no internal acknowledgment of truth, and yet have the faith of charity. These are they who have had regard to the Lord in their life, and from religion have avoided evils, but have been prevented from thinking about truths by worldly cares and by their businesses, as well as by a lack of truth on the part of their teachers. But inwardly, that is, in their spirit, they still are in the acknowledgment of truth, because they are in the affection of it, and therefore after death, when they become spirits and are instructed by angels, they acknowledge truths and receive them with joy. Very different is the case with those who have had no regard to the Lord in their life, and have not from religion avoided evils. Inwardly, that is, in their spirit, they are in no affection of truth, and consequently are in no acknowledgment of it, and therefore after death, when they become spirits and are instructed by angels, they are unwilling to acknowledge truths, and consequently do not receive them. For evil of life inwardly hates truths, whereas good of life inwardly loves them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 30 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>30. Dantur etiam multi, qui non agnitionem internam veri habent, et tamen fidem charitatis; qui sunt qui in vita spectaverunt ad Dominum, et ex religione evitaverunt mala, sed a curis in mundo et negotiis detenti a cogitando de veris, et quoque a defectu veri apud docentes: sed illi usque interius seu in suo spiritu in agnitione veri, quia in affectione ejus, sunt; quare illi post mortem, dum fiunt spiritus, et instruuntur per angelos, agnoscunt vera et cum gaudio recipiunt illa. Aliter vero illi qui in vita non spectaverunt ad Dominum, et non ex religione evitaverunt mala; hi non interius seu in suo spiritu in aliqua affectione veri, et inde nec in aliqua agnitione ejus sunt; quare ii post mortem, cum fiunt spiritus, et instruuntur per angelos, non volunt agnoscere Vera, et inde non recipiunt illa: malum vitae enim interius odit vera; at bonum vitae interius amat vera. </p>
