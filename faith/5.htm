<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith5.一种属灵观念（很少有人了解这种观念）流入那些处于对真理的情感之人，并从内在告诉他们所听见或阅读的东西是不是真的。那些以来自主的启示或光照阅读圣言的人就拥有这种观念。拥有启示或光照，无非是对这句或那句话是不是真的拥有一种感知，因而拥有一种内在承认。他们就是那些被称为“受耶和华教训”（以赛亚书54:13；约翰福音6:45）的人；论到他们，耶利米书上说：</p>
<p>看哪，日子将到，我要立新约，所立的约乃是这样：我要将我的律法放在他们里面，写在他们心上，他们各人不再教导自己的同伴和自己的弟兄说，你该认识耶和华；因为他们都必认识我。（耶利米书31:31，33-34）</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 5</h4><p>5. There is a spiritual perspective, of which few people know anything at all, a perspective that inflows in the case of people who have a longing for truth and tells them inwardly whether what they are hearing or reading is true or not. When we are reading the Word with enlightenment from the Lord, we have this perspective. Having enlightenment is nothing more nor less than having a perception and therefore an inner acknowledgment that this or that statement is true. Isaiah calls such people “taught by Jehovah” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>; see also <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_45.htm">John 6:45</a>); and Jeremiah says of them,<p>Behold, the days are coming in which I will make a new covenant. This will be the covenant: I will put my law in their midst and I will write it on their heart. No longer will people teach their friends or their family, saying, “Know Jehovah, ” for they will all know me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">33-34</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 5</h4><p>5. It is a spiritual idea — of which few know anything — that flows in with people who have an affection for truth, and which inwardly dictates whether something they have heard or read is true or not.<p>Those people experience this idea who read the Word in a state of enlightenment by the Lord. To be enlightened means nothing less than to have a perception and so an internal acknowledgment that something or other is true. Such people are said to be taught by Jehovah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_45.htm">John 6:45</a>). And concerning them we read in Jeremiah:<p>"Behold, the days are coming…, when I will make a new covenant…. …this (shall be) the covenant…. I will put My law in their inner selves, and write it on their hearts…. And no more shall every man teach his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, ‘Know Jehovah,’ for they all shall know Me…. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">33-34</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 5</h4><p>5. There is a spiritual idea of which few people have any knowledge, which flows into those who are in the affection of truth, and which interiorly pronounces that what they hear or read is true or not. This idea is present with those who read the Word in enlightenment from the Lord: and to be in enlightenment is nothing else than to be in the perception and consequently in the internal acknowledgment that this or that is true. Those who are in this enlightenment are they who are said to be taught of Jehovah, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_45.htm">John 6:45</a>; and of whom it is said in Jeremiah:<p>Behold, the days come . . . that I will make a new covenant . . .<p>This shall be the covenant ... I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts ...<p>And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">33-34</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 5</h4><p>5. A spiritual idea (about which few know anything) inflows into those who are in the affection of truth, and inwardly tells them that what they hear or read is true, or is not true. In this idea are those who read the Word in enlightenment from the Lord. To be in enlightenment is nothing else than to be in the perception, and in the consequent internal acknowledgment, that this or that is true. These are they who are called "the taught of Jehovah" (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_54_13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_45.htm">John 6:45</a>); and of whom it is said in Jeremiah: <p>Behold, the days come that I will make a new covenant: this shall be the covenant: I will put My law in their inward parts, and upon their heart will I write it, and they shall teach no more every man his companion, or every man his brother, saying, Know [Cognoscite] Jehovah; for they shall all know Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">33-34</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 5 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>5. Est idea spiritualis, de qua pauci aliquid norunt, quae influit apud illos qui in affectione veri sunt, et interius dictat quod hoc, quod auditur aut legitur, verum sit vel non. In hac idea sunt illi, qui in illustratione a Domino legunt Verbum. In illustratione esse non aliud est quam in perceptione esse, et inde in agnitione interna, quod hoc et illud verum sit. Hi sunt qui vocantur "docti a Jehovah" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_5/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_54_13">Esaiam 54:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_5/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_6_45">Johannem 6:45</a>): et de quibus dicitur apud Jeremiam, <p>"Ecce dies venientes,... quibus pangam... novum foedus... Foedus hoc erit;... dabo legem meam in medio eorum, et super cor eorum scribam illam:... et non docebunt vir amplius socium suum, aut vir fratrem suum, dicendo, Cognoscite Jehovam; omnes enim cognoscent Me" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_5/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_31_31">31:31</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_5/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_31_33-34">33-34</a>). </p>
