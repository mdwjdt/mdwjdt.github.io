<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 40</h4><p>40. I will forego a detailed examination and evaluation of whether their claims are the truth. The truth is quite clear from what has already been said, and especially from the material from the Word presented and supported with reasoning in Teachings for the New Jerusalem on the Lord and Teachings about Life for the New Jerusalem. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 40</h4><p>40. We will not, however, proceed to examine and weigh these postulates one by one to see whether they are truths. For what they are is clearly apparent from what we have said here above, especially from what we demonstrated from the Word and at the same time rationally confirmed in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord, and in The Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 40</h4><p>40. It is, however, unnecessary to examine and weigh carefully these propositions severally to ascertain whether they are true or not. This is plainly manifest from what has been said above; and especially from what has been demonstrated from the Word and at the same time rationally confirmed in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD, and THE DOCTRINE OF LIFE FOR THE NEW JERUSALEM. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 40</h4><p>40. We forbear to examine and weigh these points severally in regard to their being truths, their real character being very evident from what has already been said, especially from what has been shown from the Word, and at the same time rationally confirmed, in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord, and in the Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 40 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>40. Sed haec singillatim lustrare et expendere, num veritates sint, supersedetur; patent manifeste ex illis quae hic supra dicta sunt, imprimis ex illis, quae in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino, et in Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma, ex Verbo demonstrata sunt, et simul rationaliter confirmata. </p>
