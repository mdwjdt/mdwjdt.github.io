<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之信仰篇》 第7节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith7.主之所以在福音书和启示录谈论信，是因为犹太人不相信祂是众先知所预言的弥赛亚这事是真的；凡不信真理的地方，就会谈论信。然而，拥有对主的信仰和相信是一回事，拥有对其他某个人的信仰和相信是另一回事。下面就解释这种区别。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 7</h4><p>7. The reason the Lord talked about faith in the Gospels and Revelation was that the Jews did not believe it was true that he was the Messiah foretold by the prophets; and wherever the truth is not believed, faith enters the discussion. Nevertheless, it is one thing to have faith and believe in the Lord and something else to have faith and believe someone else. We will get to that difference later. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 7</h4><p>7. "Faith" is the term used by the Lord in the Gospels and in the book of Revelation because the Jews did not believe it to be true that the Lord was the Messiah foretold by the prophets; and when truth is not believed, the term "faith" is used instead.<p>Nevertheless, it is one thing to have faith in the Lord and believe Him, and another to have faith in and believe someone else. We will explain the difference below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 7</h4><p>7. The reason why faith is mentioned by the Lord in the Gospels and in Revelation was because the Jews did not believe it to be true that the Lord was the Messiah foretold by the Prophets; and where truth is not believed, there faith is mentioned. Still, it is one thing to have faith and to believe on the Lord, and another thing to have faith and believe any man. The difference will be explained below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 7</h4><p>7. The reason the term "faith" is used by the Lord in the Gospels and Revelation is that the Jews did not believe it to be true that He was the Messiah foretold by the prophets; and where truth is not believed, there "faith" is spoken of. But still it is one thing to have faith and believe in the Lord, and another to have faith and believe in someone else. The difference will be explained below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 7 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>7. Quod fides dicatur a Domino apud Evangelistas et in Apocalypsi, erat quia Judaei non crediderunt verum esse, quod Dominus esset Messias a prophetis praedictus; et ubi veritas non creditur, ibi fides dicitur. At usque aliud est fidem habere et credere in Dominum, et aliud fidem habere et credere alicui: de differentia dicetur infra. </p>
