<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith18.要知道，仁与信构成一体，正如意愿与理解力构成一体，因为仁属于意愿，信属于理解力。同样，仁与信构成一体，正如情感与思维构成一体，因为情感属于意愿，思维属于理解力。而且，仁与信构成一体，正如良善与真理构成一体，因为良善涉及属于意愿的情感，真理涉及属于理解力的思维。总之，仁与信构成一体，正如本质与形式构成一体，因为仁是信的本质，信是仁的形式。由此明显可知，没有仁的信，就像没有一个本质的一个形式，根本什么东西都不是；没有信的仁则像没有一个形式的一个本质，同样根本什么东西都不是。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 18</h4><p>18. It is important to know that caring and faith are united in the same way that our will and our understanding are united, since our will is the part of us that cares and our understanding is the part of us that has faith. It is also important to know that caring and faith are united in the same way our desiring and our thinking are united, since our will is the part of us that feels desire and our understanding is the part of us that thinks. And again, caring and faith are united in the same way that goodness and truth are united, since what is good is the object of the desire in our will and what is true is the object of the thinking in our understanding.<p>[2] In short, caring and faith are united in the same way that essence and form are united, because the essence of faith is caring and the form of caring is faith. So we can see that faith without caring is like a form with no essence, which is nothing, and that caring without faith is like an essence with no form, which also is nothing. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 18</h4><p>18. It should be known that charity and faith are united like the will and the intellect, since charity is a property of the will and faith a property of the intellect.<p>By the same token, charity and faith are united like affection and thought, since affection is a property of the will and thought a property of the intellect.<p>So, too, charity and faith are united like goodness and truth, because goodness is connected with affection, which is a property of the will, and truth is connected with thought, which is a property of the intellect. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 18</h4><p>18. It should be known that charity and faith make one, as the will and the understanding do, since charity has relation to the will and faith to the understanding. It should likewise be known that charity and faith make one, as affection and thought do, since affection has relation to the will and thought to the understanding; likewise that charity and faith make one as good and truth do, for good has relation to affection, which belongs to the will, and truth has relation to thought, which belongs to the understanding.<p>In a word, charity and faith make one, like essence and form, since the essence of faith is charity, and the form of charity is faith. Hence it is evident that faith without charity is like a form without an essence, which is not anything; and that charity without faith is like an essence without form, which likewise is not anything. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 18</h4><p>18. Be it known that charity and faith make a one as do the will and the understanding, for charity is of the will, and faith is of the understanding. And in the same way, that charity and faith make a one as do affection and thought, because affection is of the will, and thought is of the understanding. And also that charity and faith make a one as do good and truth, because good is of affection which belongs to the will, and truth is of thought which belongs to the understanding. In a word, charity and faith make a one as do essence and form, because charity is the essence of faith, and faith is the form of charity. This shows that faith without charity is like a form without an essence, which is not anything at all; and that charity without faith is like an essence without a form, which likewise is not anything at all. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 18 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>18. Sciendum est, quod charitas et fides faciant unum sicut voluntas et intellectus, quoniam charitas est voluntatis et fides est intellectus. Similiter, quod charitas et fides faciant unum sicut affectio et cogitatio, quoniam affectio est voluntatis et cogitatio est intellectus. Similiter, quod charitas et fides faciant unum sicut bonum et verum, quia bonum est affectionis quae voluntatis et verum est cogitationis quae intellectus. <p>Verbo, charitas et fides faciunt unum sicut essentia et forma, quoniam essentia fidei est charitas et forma charitatis est fides: ex quibus patet, quod fides absque charitate sit sicut forma absque essentia, quae non est aliquid; et quod charitas absque fide sit sicut essentia absque forma, quae nec est aliquid. </p>
