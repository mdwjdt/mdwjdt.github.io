<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith47.你若关闭人们的眼睛，塞住他们的耳朵，设法叫他们不运用理解力来思考，难道不会诱使他们相信神已经把祂的一切权柄都赐给了一个人，好叫他可以在地上作神吗？难道不会诱使他们相信要向死人祈求，在死者的画像前脱帽跪拜，并且他们那毫无生命的尸体，他们的骸骨、坟墓，都是神圣的，要受到尊敬吗？但你若睁开双眼，拔掉耳塞，也就是运用某种理解力来思想这些事，岂不会看到人类理性必憎恶的怪诞谬论吗？</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 47</h4><p>47. Close people’s eyes and plug their ears—that is, prevent them from thinking with any understanding—and can’t you then induce a belief that God has given all his power to some person to act as God on earth? Can’t you induce a belief that we are to pray to dead people, that we are to bare our heads and bend our knees to their images, to regard their corpses, their bones, and their tombs as holy and worthy of reverence?<p>But if you open your own eyes and unplug your ears, that is, if you think about these matters with some understanding, will you not see these beliefs as monstrous things that are appalling to human reason? </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 47</h4><p>47. Close people’s eyes and block their ears, and prevent them from thinking with any comprehension — could you not instill in them a belief that God gave all His power to a man so as to make him a God on earth? Could you not instill in them a belief that dead people may be called upon for assistance? That one must bare the head and genuflect before images of them? And that their bodies, bones, and graves are holy and are to be venerated?<p>But if you open your eyes and unblock your ears, which is to say, if you think about these matters with some comprehension, will you not see enormous errors that are abhorrent to human reason? </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 47</h4><p>47. If you close men's eyes and stop their ears, and cause them not to think with understanding, could you not induce them to believe that God has given all His power to a man, that he might be as God upon earth? Could you not induce them to believe that dead men ought to be invoked? that people ought to uncover their heads and bend their knees before their images? and that their dead bodies, their bones and their sepulchres are sacred and ought to be venerated? If, however, you open your eyes and unstop your ears, that is, if you think about these things with any degree of understanding, will you not view them as enormities which human reason must abominate? </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 47</h4><p>47. Shut men's eyes and stop up their ears, and contrive that they do not think from any understanding, and can you not then lead them to believe that God has given all His authority to a man, to be as God upon earth? Can you not lead them to believe that the dead are to be addressed in prayer? that men are to bare the head and bend the knee before images of the dead? and that their lifeless bodies, their bones, and their graves, are holy and are to be venerated? But if you open your eyes and unstop your ears, that is, think about these things from some understanding, will you not behold preposterous absurdities that human reason must abhor? </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 47 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>47. Occlude oculos et obtura aures, et fac ut non cogitent ex aliquo intellectu; annon poteris inducere fidem, quod Deus dederit omnem suam potestatem homini, ut sit pro Deo in terris? Annon poteris inducere fidem, quod homines mortui invocandi sint? quod nudandum sit caput et flectenda sint genua pro simulacris eorum? quodque cadavera eorum, ossa eorum, et sepulcra illorum, sancta sint et veneranda? Sed si aperis oculos et recludis aures, hoc est, de illis ex aliquo intellectu cogitas, annon videbis enormia, quae ratio humana abominabitur? </p>
