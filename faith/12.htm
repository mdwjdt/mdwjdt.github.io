<h4 align="center"></h4><p>Faith12.如果有人在自己里面思想，或对别人说：“谁能拥有对真理的内在承认，也就是信仰呢？我是不能”，我会告诉他如何能拥有它，即：避恶如罪，转向主，你就会拥有你想要的那种内在承认。凡避恶如罪的人都在主里面（可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》，18-31节）；这种人热爱并看见真理（Life32-41节）；他拥有信仰（Life42-52节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Faith (Dole translation 2017) 12</h4><p>12. Some may think to themselves or say to someone else, “Who is capable of having the inner recognition of truth that is faith? Not I.” I will tell them how they can: Turn your back on evils because they are sins and turn to the Lord, and you will have as much of that inner recognition as you wish.<p>You may see in <a href="../life/18.htm">The Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem 18-31</a> that if we turn our backs on evils because they are sins we are in the Lord; in <a href="../life/32.htm">32-41</a> that we then love what is true and see it; and in <a href="../life/42.htm">42-52</a> that we then have faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 2014) 12</h4><p>12. If someone thinks to himself or says to another, "Who is capable of an internal acknowledgment of truth so as to have faith in it? I am not," I say to him, "This is how: refrain from evils as being sins and turn to the Lord, and you will have as much as you desire."<p>To be shown that someone who refrains from evils as being sins is in the Lord, see <a href="../life/18.htm">The Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem 18-31</a>. That he loves truth and sees it, <a href="../life/32.htm">32-41</a>. And that he has faith, see <a href="../life/42.htm">The Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem 42-52</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Rogers translation 1954) 12</h4><p>12. If any one thinks within himself, or says to another, "Who can have that internal acknowledgment of truth which is faith? I cannot," I will tell him how he may have it: Shun evils as sins, and approach the Lord, and you will have as much as you desire.<p>That he who shuns evils as sins is in the Lord, may be seen in <a href="../life/18.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF LIFE FOR THE NEW JERUSALEM 18-31</a>; that he loves truth and sees it (<a href="../life/32.htm">32-41</a>); and that he has faith (<a href="../life/42.htm">42-52</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of Faith (Potts translation 1904) 12</h4><p>12. If any one should think within himself, or say to some one else, "Who is able to have the internal acknowledgment of truth which is faith? not I;" let me tell him how he may have it: Shun evils as sins, and come to the Lord, and you will have as much of it as you desire. (That he who shuns evils as sins is in the Lord, see the <a href="../life/18.htm">Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem 18-31</a>; that such a one loves truth, and sees it, <a href="../life/32.htm">Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem 32-41</a>; and that he has faith, <a href="../life/42.htm">Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem 42-52</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Fide 12 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>12. Si quis cogitat secum, aut dicit alteri, "Quis potest habere agnitionem internam veri quae fides? ego non possum;" sed illi dicam, quomodo possit: Fuge mala ut peccata, et adi Dominum, et habebis quantum desideras. Quod ille qui fugit mala ut peccata in Domino sit, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_12/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_18">Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 18-31</a>; quod ille amet verum, et videat illud (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_12/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_32">32-41</a> ibi); et quod ille fidem habeat (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-fide_12/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_42">42-52</a> ibi). </p>
