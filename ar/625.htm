<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第625节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>625.“他们在神的宝座面前是没有瑕疵的”表因为他们处于来自主源于良善的真理。“没有瑕疵的”表示那些未陷入邪恶，因而处于真理的人；因为“瑕疵”表示虚假，严格来说，表示源于邪恶的虚假。“神的宝座”表示主和天堂（<a href="14.htm">14</a>，<a href="233.htm">233</a>节）；因为所有处于源自主的良善之人，都看似处于真理，所以“他们在神的宝座前是没有瑕疵的”表示他们处于来自主源于良善的真理。事实上，所有正在被主引领之人都被保守在来自祂的良善中，除了真理之外，没有任何东西从这良善发出；即便有虚假发出，那也是表面的虚假，主将其视同真理，只是经过天堂之光的改进，披上了另一种色彩而已；因为从内居于它里面的良善使其具有这种资格。事实上，虚假既有源于邪恶的，也有源于良善的，就外在形式而言，它们看上去十分相似，然而它们截然不同，因为在内之物构成本质，并产生它们的性质。由于“瑕疵”表示虚假，故：</p><p>亚伦的种中身体有残疾者禁止接近祭坛，或进到幔子里面。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利21.17.htm">21:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利21.23.htm">23</a>）</p><p>以此表示他们不当有瑕疵。还禁止：</p><p>将有残疾的公牛，牛犊，绵羊，山羊或羊羔献上。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利22.19.htm">22:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利22.25.htm">25</a>）</p><p>那里还列举了各种残疾。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 625</h4><p>625. For they are without blemish before the throne of God. This symbolically means, because they are governed by truths springing from goodness from the Lord.<p>Being without blemish symbolizes people who are not caught up in falsities, who accordingly are governed by truths; for blemishes symbolize falsities, especially falsities springing from evil. The throne of God symbolizes the Lord and heaven (nos. <a href="14.htm">14</a>, <a href="233.htm">233</a>). And because people governed by good from the Lord all appear as though governed by truths, therefore their being without blemish before the throne of God means symbolically that they are governed by truths that spring from goodness received from the Lord.<p>The reason is that people who are led by the Lord are all kept in a state of goodness received from Him, and from that goodness springs naught but truth. Even if falsity springs from it, it is apparent falsity, and this the Lord regards as akin to truth, being only of another color through a modification of the light of heaven. For the goodness that is present within it thus qualifies it.<p>It is possible, indeed, for falsity to spring from evil, and also for falsity to spring from goodness. The two may appear in outward form alike, but still they are totally different, because that which lies within forms the essence of each and produces its character.<p>Since blemishes symbolize falsities, therefore it was forbidden for any of the offspring of Aaron who had a defect to approach the altar or to enter within the veil (<a href="3927/leviticus_21_17.htm">Leviticus 21:17-23</a>). This meant that they were to be without blemish.<p>Moreover, the Israelites were also forbidden to offer a sacrifice of cattle, calves, sheep, goats, or lambs which had a blemish (<a href="3927/leviticus_22_19.htm">Leviticus 22:19-25</a>). The blemishes, too, are listed there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 625</h4><p>625. 'For they are spotless before the throne of God' signifies because they are in truths derived from good from the Lord. By the 'spotless ones are signified those who are not in untruths, and consequently are in truths; for 'spots' signify untruths, properly untruths derived from evil. By 'the throne of God' is signified the Lord and heaven (<a href="14.htm">14</a>, <a href="233.htm">233</a>); and because all who are in good from the Lord appear as being in truths, therefore by their being 'spotless before the throne of God' is signified that they are in truths derived from good from the Lord. For all who are being led by the Lord are kept in good from Him, and out of that good nothing proceeds but truth; and if untruth proceeds, it is apparent untruth, and this is regarded by the Lord as like truth, only in another colour by the modification of the light of heaven; for the good that is inwardly in it so qualifies it. For there can be untruth derived from evil and also untruth derived from good, and each of them can appear alike in external form, but yet they are quite unlike, because what is within makes the essence and produces its quality. Since untruths are signified by 'spots,' therefore:<p>It was forbidden that anyone of the seed of Aaron in whom there was a spot should approach the altar, or enter within the veil. <a href="3927/leviticus_21_17.htm">Leviticus 21:17-23</a>; by which it was signified that they should be spotless. And also:<p>It was forbidden that any sacrifice should be made of oxen, calves, sheep, goats, or lambs, in which there was a spot. <a href="3927/leviticus_22_19.htm">Leviticus 22:19-25</a>.<p>The spots are also enumerated there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 625</h4><p>625. For they are spotless before the throne of God, signifies because they are in truths from good from the Lord. By "spotless" are signified those who are not in falsities, consequently who are in truths; for "spots" signify falsities, properly falsities from evil; by "the throne of God" is signified the Lord and heaven, (<a href="14.htm">14</a>, <a href="233.htm">233</a>); and as all who are in good from the Lord, appear as if they were in truths, therefore by "they are spotless before the throne of God" is signified that they are in truths from good from the Lord. For all who are led by the Lord are kept by Him in good, and from that good there proceeds nothing but truth; and if a falsity does proceed from it, it is an apparent falsity, which is regarded by the Lord as like truth, only by the modification of the light of heaven it is in another color; for the good that is within it, so qualifies it; for there is given falsity from evil, and also falsity from good; both may appear alike in the external form, but still they are altogether dissimilar, because that which is within makes the essence, and produces its quality. Since "spots" signify falsities, therefore:<p>It was forbidden that anyone of the seed of Aaron in whom there was a spot, should approach the altar, and enter within the veil, (<a href="3927/leviticus_21_17.htm">Leviticus 21:17</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_23.htm">23</a>).<p>By this was signified that they should be spotless.<p>And also it was forbidden that any sacrifice should be offered of oxen, calves, sheep, goats or lambs, on which there was a spot, (<a href="3927/leviticus_22_19.htm">Leviticus 22:19-25</a>).<p>The spots are also enumerated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 625 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>625. "Immaculati enim sunt coram Throno Dei," significat quia sunt in veris ex bono a Domino. - Per "immaculatos" significantur qui non in falsis sunt, proinde qui in veris; "maculae" enim significant falsa, proprie falsa ex malo; per "Thronum Dei" significatur Dominus et Caelum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_625/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_14" target=_top>14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_625/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233" target=_top>233</a>); et quia omnes qui in bono sunt a Domino, apparent sicut in veris sint, ideo per quod "immaculati sint coram Throno Dei" significatur quod in veris sint ex bono a Domino. Omnes enim qui ducuntur a Domino, tenentur in bono ab Ipso, et ex bono illo non procedit nisi verum; et si falsum, est falsum apparens, et hoc spectatur a Domino simile vero, solum per modificationem lucis Caeli in alio colore; bonum enim, quod intus in illo est, id ita qualificat: datur enim falsum ex malo, et quoque falsum ex bono; utrumque potest apparere in externa forma simile, sed usque prorsus dissimilia sunt, quia id quod intus est, facit essentiam, et producit quale ejus. Quoniam per "maculas" significantur falsa, ideo Prohibitum fuit, ne aliquis ex semine Aharonis, in quo esset Macula, accederet ad Altare, ac intraret intra Velum, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_625/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_21_17-23" target=_top>Leviticus 21:17-23</a>) <p>per quod significabatur, quod immaculati essent: et quoque Prohibitum fuit, ne aliquod sacrificium ex bobus, vitulis, ovibus, capris, agnis, in quibus esset Macula, fieret, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_625/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_22_15" target=_top>Leviticus 22:15</a>);<p>maculae etiam ibi recensentur. </p>
