<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第305节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>305.启6:4.“就另有一匹马出来，是红的”表在良善和由此而来的生活方面，这些人完全丧失了对圣言的理解。“马”表示对圣言的理解（<a href="298.htm">298</a>节）；“红”表示被毁灭的良善。白色之所以论及真理，是因为它源自天堂太阳之光；红色之所以论及良善，是因为它源自天堂太阳之火（参看<a href="167.htm">167</a>，<a href="231.htm">231</a>节）。但“红”论及被毁灭的良善的原因在于，此处的“红”表示地狱之红，源自地狱之火，也就是对邪恶的热爱；为地狱之红的红是丑陋可憎的，其中的事物都是死的，而非活的；正因如此，“红马”表示对圣言的理解在良善方面遭到毁坏。这一点也可从下面对它的描述明显看出来：“有权柄给了那骑马的，可以从地上夺去太平，使他们彼此相杀”。“第二个活物”像牛犊，表示情感方面的圣言神性真理（<a href="242.htm">242</a>节），它也说“你来看”，从而说明他们没有良善的情感，因此没有良善。红论及爱，无论是对良善的爱，还是对邪恶的爱。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>祂在葡萄酒中洗了衣服，在血红葡萄汁中洗了袍褂；祂的眼睛比酒红润，祂的牙齿比奶洁白。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.11.htm">49:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>这些话说的是主。还有：</p><p>这从以东来的是谁呢？祂的服装为何有红色？祂的衣服为何像踹酒榨的呢？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.1.htm">63:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>这也论及主。</p><p>锡安的拿细耳人比雪更白、比奶更亮；他们的身体比红光宝石更红。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.7.htm">4:7</a>）</p><p>在这些经文中，“红”论及对良善的爱；在以下经文中，则论及对邪恶的爱：</p><p>盾牌是红的，军人都穿着朱红衣；战车在火把之火中，形状如火把。（那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿2.3.htm">2:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿2.4.htm">4</a>）</p><p>你们的罪虽然朱红，必变成雪白；虽红如丹颜、必白如羊毛。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.18.htm">1:18</a>）</p><p>启示录（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.3.htm">12:3</a>）中的“红龙”，撒迦利亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚1.8.htm">1:8</a>）中站在番石榴树中间的“红马”也并非表示别的。源自红的色调，诸如猩红、朱红，也论及类似事物。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 305</h4><p>305. And another horse, fiery red, went out. (<a href="3927/revelation_6_4.htm">6:4</a>) This symbolizes an understanding of the Word among them extinguished as to goodness and thus extinguished as regards their life.<p>A horse symbolizes an understanding of the Word (no. <a href="298.htm">298</a>), and a fiery red color symbolizes good extinguished. To be shown that the color white is predicated of truths, because it takes its origin from the light of the sun in heaven, and that the color red is predicated of goods, because it takes its origin from the fire of the sun in heaven, see nos. <a href="167.htm">167</a>, <a href="231.htm">231</a> above.<p>A fiery red, on the other hand, is predicated of good extinguished, because a fiery red means a hellish red, which takes its origin from hellfire, which is a love of evil. A fiery red, being a hellish red, is hideous and dreadful, because it has no spark of life in it, but is totally lifeless. So it is that a fiery red horse symbolizes an understanding of the Word extinguished as to goodness. This, too, can be seen from the description of its rider, that it was granted him "to take peace from the earth, so that people might kill one another," as said next.<p>Moreover, it was the second living creature, which was like a calf, symbolizing the Divine truth of the Word in respect to its affection (no. <a href="242.htm">242</a>), that said, "Come and see," thus showing that the people described had no affection for good, thus no goodness, among them.<p>That redness is predicated of both a love of good and a love of evil, can be seen from the following passages:<p>Who... washed his garment in wine, and his vesture in the blood of grapes, with eyes redder than wine, and teeth whiter than milk. (<a href="3927/genesis_49_11.htm">Genesis 49:11-12</a>)<p>This is said in reference to the Lord.<p>Who is this who comes from Edom..., red as to apparel, and apparel like that of one who treads in the winepress? (<a href="3927/isaiah_63_1.htm">Isaiah 63:1-2</a>)<p>This, too, said in reference to the Lord.<p>Her Nazirites were whiter than snow and brighter white than milk. Redder were they in their bones than rubies... (<a href="3927/lamentations_4_7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>)<p>Redness in these places is predicated of a love of good. In the following places it is predicated of a love of evil:<p>The shield... is made reddish, and the... men are in crimson. The chariots come with flaming torches...; their appearance is like that of torches... (<a href="3927/nahum_2_3.htm">Nahum 2:3-4</a>)<p>Though your sins have been like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they have been red like crimson, they shall be as wool. (<a href="3927/isaiah_1_18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>)<p>This is also the symbolic meaning of the fiery red dragon in <a href="3927/revelation_12_3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>, and of the fiery red horse standing among the myrtle trees in <a href="3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>.<p>Similar meanings are predicated of colors that derive their hue from the color red, such as scarlet and crimson. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 305</h4><p>305. [verse 4] 'And there went forth another horse, red (rufus),' signifies the understanding of the Word utterly lost as to good, and consequently as to life with these. By 'a horse' the understanding of the Word is signified (<a href="298.htm">298</a>), and by 'red' is signified good utterly lost. That the colour white is predicated of truths because it is derived from the light of the Sun of heaven, and the colour red of goods because it is derived from the fire of the Sun of heaven, may be seen above (<a href="167.htm">167</a>, <a href="231.htm">231</a>). 'Red,' however, is predicated of good utterly lost, because by 'red' an infernal red is understood, and this is derived from the fire of hell, which is the love of evil. The redness that is the infernal red is hideous and abominable because there is nothing alive in it, but it is all dead. It is in consequence of this that by the 'red horse' is signified the understanding of the Word utterly lost as to good. This can also be established from the description thereof, as it follows that 'it was given him to take away peace from the land, so that they should slay one another.' Moreover, the second animal which was like a calf, by which is signified the Divine Truth of the Word as to affection (<a href="242.htm">242</a>), said, 'Come and look,' thus showing that there was no affection of good, thus no good with them. That 'red' (rubrum) is said of the love of good as well as of evil, can be established from the following passages:<p>Who washed his clothing in wine, and his covering in the blood of grapes, with eyes redder than wine, and teeth whiter than milk. <a href="3927/genesis_49_11.htm">Genesis 49:11-12</a>.<p>These things are said of the Lord. Also concerning the Lord:<p>Who is this coming out of Edom, red as to garment, and a garment as of those treading in the winepress? <a href="3927/isaiah_63_1.htm">Isaiah 63:1-2</a>.<p>The Nazirites were whiter than snow, more bright than milk, they were redder as to bones than rubies, <a href="3927/lamentations_4_7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>,<p>In these passages 'red' is predicated of the love of good: in the following it is predicated of the love of evil:<p>The shield was made ruddy, and the men dressed in purple, in a fire of little torches were their chariots, their aspect as of torches, <a href="3927/nahum_2_3.htm">Nahum 2:3-4</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/nahum_2_4.htm">4-5</a>].<p>If your sins have been as scarlet, they shall become white as snow; if they have been red as purple, they shall be as wool. <a href="3927/isaiah_1_18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>.<p>Nor is anything else signified by the 'red dragon' (<a href="3927/revelation_12_3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>); and by the 'red horse standing among the myrtle trees' (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>). Similar things are predicated of the colours that are derived from red, as of scarlet and purple. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 305</h4><p>305. Verse 4. And there went out another horse that was red, signifies the understanding of the Word destroyed as to good, and thence as to life with these. By "a horse" is signified the understanding of the Word, (<a href="298.htm">298</a>); and by "red" [rufus] is signified good destroyed. That the color white is predicated of truths, because it is from the light of the sun of heaven, and the color red [ruber] is predicated of goods because it is from the fire of the sun of heaven may be seen above, (<a href="167.htm">167</a>[1-2], <a href="231.htm">231</a>). But the reason why "red" [rufus] is predicated of good destroyed, is, because by red [rufus] an infernal red is meant, which is from infernal fire, which is the love of evil; the red which is an infernal red is hideous and abominable, there being nothing alive therein, but all dead; hence it is, that by "a red horse" is signified the understanding of the Word destroyed as to good. This may also appear from the description of it below; that "it was given him to take peace from the earth, that they should kill one another:" "the second animal" also, which was like a calf, by which is signified the Divine truth of the Word as to affection, (<a href="242.htm">242</a>), said, "Come and look," and thus showed that there was no affection of good, and thence no good with them. That red is spoken of love, as well the love of good as of evil, may appear from the following passages:<p>Who washed His clothing in wine, His covering in the blood of grapes; His eyes are redder than wine, and His teeth whiter than milk, (<a href="3927/genesis_49_11.htm">Genesis 49:11-12</a>).<p>This is concerning the Lord:<p>Who is this that cometh from Edom, red as to His garment, and His garment as of him that treadeth in the winepress, (<a href="3927/isaiah_63_1.htm">Isaiah 63:1-2</a>).<p>This is also concerning the Lord:<p>The Nazarites were whiter than snow, brighter than milk; their bones were redder than red-shining gems, (<a href="3927/lamentations_4_7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>).<p>In these passages "red" is predicated of the love of good; in the following, of the love of evil:<p>The shield was made red, and the men were empurpled; in the fire of torches were their chariots, their aspect was as of a torch, (<a href="3927/nahum_2_3.htm">Nahum 2:3-4</a>).<p>If your sins were as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; If they were red as purple, they shall be as wool, (<a href="3927/isaiah_1_18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>).<p>Neither is anything else signified by the "red dragon" (<a href="3927/revelation_12_3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>); and by the "red horse standing among the myrtle trees" (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>). Similar things are said of the colors which are derived from red, as of scarlet and purple. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 305 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>305. (Vers. 4.) "Et exivit alius Equus, rufus," significat intellectum Verbi deperditum quoad bonum, et inde quoad vitam apud hos. - Per "equum" significatur intellectus Verbi (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_305/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_298" target=_top>298</a>), et per "rufum" significatur bonum deperditum; quod color albus praedicetur de veris, quia ille est ex luce Solis caeli, et color ruber de bonis, quia ille est ex igne Solis caeli, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_305/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_167" target=_top>167</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_305/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_231" target=_top>231</a>); quod autem "rufum" praedicetur de bono deperdito, est quia per "rufum" intelligitur rubrum infernale, quod est ex igne Inferni, qui est amor mali; rufum, quod est rubrum infernale, est tetrum et abominable, quia nihil vivum in illo est, sed omne mortuum; inde est quod per "equum rufum" significetur intellectus Verbi deperditus quoad bonum. Hoc quoque constare potest a descriptione ejus, quod "datum sit ei tollere pacem de terra, ut alii alios occiderent," ut sequitur: etiam "secundum Animal," quod erat simile vitulo, per quod significatur Divinum Verum Verbi quoad affectionem (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_305/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_242" target=_top>242</a>) <sup>1</sup>, dixit, "Veni et aspice," ita ostendit, quod nulla affectio boni, ita nullum bonum, apud illos esset. Quod "rubrum" dicatur de amore tam boni quam mali, constare potest a sequentibus locis: <p>"Qui lavit in vino indumentum Suum, et in sanguine uvarum velamen Suum, Ruber oculis prae vino, et albus dente prae lacte," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_305/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_49_11-12" target=_top>Genesis 49:11-12</a>);<p>haec de Domino. <p>"Quis Hic venit ex Edom: Ruber quoad vestem, et vestis sicut calcantis in torculari," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_305/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_63_1-2" target=_top>Esaias 63:1-2</a>) <sup>2</sup><p>etiam de Domino. <p>"Albi erant Naziraei prae nive, candidi prae lacte, Rubri erant quoad ossa prae gemmis rubentibus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_305/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_lamentations_4_7" target=_top>Threni 4:7</a>).<p>In his locis "rubrum" praedicatur de amore boni; in sequentibus de amore mali: <p>"Clypeus Rubicundus factus est, et viri Purpurati, in igne facularum currus eorum, aspectus eorum sicut facum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_305/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_nahum_2_4-5" target=_top>Nahum 2:4-5</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_305/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_nahum_2_3-4" target=_top>3-4</a>));<p>"Si fuerint peccata vestra sicut Coccinea, Sicut nix albescent: si Rubra fuerint sicut Purpura, sicut lana erunt, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_305/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_1_18" target=_top>Esaias 1:18</a>).<p>Nec aliud significatur Per "Draconem Rufum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_305/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_3" target=_top>Apocalypsis 12:3</a>);<p>Et per "Equum Rufum Stantem inter myrtos," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_305/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_1_8" target=_top>Sacharias 1:8</a>).<p>Similia praedicantur de coloribus qui trahunt ex rubro, ut de coccino et purpura.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;242 pro "241"<p>2.&nbsp;1, 2 pro "2" </p>
