<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第524节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>524.启11:18.“列族发怒”表那些陷入唯信，因而陷入生活的邪恶之人，他们被激怒，并侵扰那些反对他们信仰的人。“列族”表示那些陷入生活的邪恶之人，抽象地说，表示生活的邪恶（<a href="147.htm">147</a>，<a href="483.htm">483</a>节）；不过，在此表示那些陷入唯信的人，因为此处论述的是这些人，他们之所以陷入生活的邪恶，是因为他们的宗教信仰是，律法不会责罚他们，只要他们相信基督拿走了律法的责罚。他们“发怒”不仅表示他们被激怒，还表示他们侵扰那些反对该信仰的人，这一点从下面（12，17章及以后）关于“龙”的描述明显看出来。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 524</h4><p>524. "The nations were angry." (<a href="3927/revelation_11_18.htm">11:18</a>) This symbolically means that people who were caught up in faith alone and thus in evil practices were enraged, and harassed those who opposed their faith.<p>Nations mean people caught up in evil practices, and abstractly, the evil practices themselves (nos. <a href="147.htm">147</a>, <a href="483.htm">483</a>). Here, however, it means people caught up in faith alone, because they are the subject here, and they are caught up in evil practices because their religion says that the Law does not condemn them, provided they have faith that Christ took away its condemnation.<p>Their being angry means, symbolically, not only that they were enraged, but also that they harassed people who opposed that faith of theirs, as can be seen from the description of the dragon in the next chapter, chapter 17, and later. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 524</h4><p>524. [verse 18] 'And the nations were enraged' signifies those who are in faith alone and consequently in evils of life, that they were burning with anger and attacking those who are against their faith. By 'the nations' are understood those who are in evils of life, and abstractly evils of life (<a href="147.htm">147</a>, <a href="483.htm">483</a>); here, however, those who are in faith alone, because it treats of those here, and these are in evils of life because their religion is that the law does not condemn them provided they have the faith that Christ endured the condemnation thereof. Also, their being 'enraged' signifies not only that they were burning with anger but also that they were attacking those who are against their faith, as can be established from the things following concerning 'the dragon' (chapter, <a href="3927/revelation_12_17.htm">12:17</a>, and afterwards). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 524</h4><p>524. Verse 18. And the nations were angry, signifies those who were in faith alone, and thence in evils of life, that they were enraged, and infested those who are against their faith. By "the nations" are meant those who are in evils of life, and abstractly, evils of life, (<a href="147.htm">147</a>, <a href="483.htm">483</a>); but here they who are in faith alone, because these are here treated of, and these are in evils of life, because their religion is that the law does not condemn them, provided they have faith that Christ took away its condemnation. "Their being angry" signifies not only that they were enraged, but also that they infested those who are against that faith, as may appear from what follows concerning "the dragon" (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_12_17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a>, and afterwards). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 524 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>524. (Vers. 18.) "Et gentes iratae sunt" significat illos qui in sola fide sunt, et inde in malis vitae, quod excandescerent ac infestarent illos qui contra fidem illorum sunt. - Per "gentes" intelliguntur qui in malis vitae sunt, et abstracte mala vitae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_524/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_147" target=_top>147</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_524/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_483" target=_top>483</a>); hic autem illi qui in sola fide, quia de illis hic agitur et hi in malis vitae sunt, quia religio illorum est, quod Lex illos non damnet, modo fidem habeant quod Christus sustulerit damnationem ejus. Quod "iratae sint" significat <sup>1</sup>non solum quod excandescerent, sed etiam quod infestarent illos qui contra illam fidem sunt, ut constare potest ex sequentibus de "Dracone," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_524/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_17" target=_top>12:17</a>, et postea).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;significat pro "et significat" </p>
