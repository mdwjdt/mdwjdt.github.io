<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第199节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>199.“这些事是那为阿们的，为诚信真实见证的说的”表主的圣言，就是来自祂自己的神性真理。“阿们”是指出于真理本身，也就是主，因而出于主的神性确认（参看<a href="23.htm">23</a>节）；当论及主时，“诚信真实见证的”是指圣言中来自祂的神性真理（6，<a href="16.htm">16</a>节）。无论你说主为自己作见证，还是说圣言为主作见证，意思都一样，因为此处向众教会说话的“人子”，是指主的圣言（<a href="44.htm">44</a>节）。这些事首先向老底嘉教会提出，是因为此处圣言论述的是教会中那些出于自己和出于圣言相信的人，并且那些出于圣言相信的人就是出于主相信。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 199</h4><p>199. "'These things says the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness.'" This symbolizes the Lord in relation to the Word, which is Divine truth originating from Him.<p>"Amen" is a Divine confirmation springing from the truth itself, which the Lord is, and so which is from Him, as may be seen in no. <a href="23.htm">23</a> above. Moreover, a faithful and true witness, when applied to the Lord, is the Divine truth which originates from Him in the Word (nos. <a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="16.htm">16</a>).<p>Whether you say that the Lord testifies of Himself, or that the Word does, the meaning is the same, since the Son of Man, who is the one addressing the churches here, is the Lord in relation to the Word (no. <a href="44.htm">44</a>).<p>This declaration is made first to this church, because the subject here is people in the church who base their beliefs both on their own thinking and on the Word, and people who base their beliefs on the Word, form them from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 199</h4><p>199. 'These things says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness' signifies the Lord as to the Word, which is the Divine Truth from Himself. That 'Amen' is Divine confirmation out of the Truth (veritas) Itself, which is the Lord, thus out of the Lord, may be seen above (<a href="23.htm">23</a>); and that 'the faithful and true Witness,' when [said] of the Lord, is the Divine Truth (veritas) that is from Him in the Word (<a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="16.htm">16</a>). Whether you say that the Lord bears witness concerning Himself or that the Word bears witness concerning Him, it is the same, since the SON OF MAN, Who is here speaking to the Churches, is the Lord as to the Word (<a href="44.htm">44</a>). These things are put forward first to this Church, because here [the Word] treats of those in the Church who believe both out of themselves and out of the Word, and those who believe out of the Word believe out of the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 199</h4><p>199. These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, signifies the Lord as to the Word, which is the Divine truth from Him. That "amen" is Divine confirmation from the truth itself, which is the Lord, thus from the Lord, may be seen above, (<a href="23.htm">23</a>); and that "a faithful and true witness," when spoken of the Lord, is the Divine truth which is from Him in the Word, (<a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="16.htm">16</a>). Whether you say that the Lord testifies of Himself, or that the Word testifies of Him, it is the same, because "the Son of man," who here speaks to the churches, is the Lord as to the Word, (<a href="44.htm">44</a>[1-2]). These things are premised to this church, because those in the church are here treated of who both believe from themselves and from the Word; and they who believe from the Word, believe from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 199 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>199. "Haec dicit Amen, Testis fidelis et Verus," significat Dominum quoad Verbum, quod est Divinum Verum ad Ipso. - Quod "Amen" sit Divina confirmatio ex ipsa Veritate, quae eat Dominus, ita ex Domino, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_199/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_23" target=_top>23</a>); et quod "Testis fidelis et verus," cum de Domino, sit Divina Veritas quae ab Ipso in Verbo (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_199/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6" target=_top>6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_199/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_16" target=_top>16</a>); sive dicas, quod Dominus testetur de Se Ipso, sive quod Verbum de Ipso, idem est, quoniam "Filius Hominis," qui hic loquitur ad Ecclesias, est Dominus quoad Verbum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_199/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_44" target=_top>44</a>). Haec prae mittuntur ad hanc Ecclesiam, quia hic de illis in Ecclesia agitur, qui et credunt ex se et ex Verbo, et qui credunt ex Verbo credunt ex Domino. </p>
