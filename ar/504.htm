<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>504.“就是我们的主钉十字架的地方”表不承认主的神性人，因而表弃绝的状态。在教会，论到亵渎主的人，就说他们“把主钉在十字架上”，就像犹太人那样，他们否认祂是神的儿子。那些否认主的人性为神性的人之所以就像犹太人，是因为每个人都视主为一个人，若视祂的人性如同另一人的人性，就无法思想祂的神性，无论他怎样称这人性为自永恒所生的神儿子，并与父的神性同等。当谈论或读到这句话时，听是听到了，但若将主视为物质人（material man），和其他任何人一样，并且同样具有血气的属性，那么同时却不相信；于是，他移除主的神性，不再关注它，故处于好像否认它的状态，因为他否认主的人性是神的儿子，就像犹太人否认它，并为此将主钉在十字架上那样。然而，经上公开声明，主的人性就是神的儿子（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.32.htm">1:32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.35.htm">35</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.16.htm">3:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.17.htm">17</a>等）。</p><p>从这些事明显可知，为何教会之人直接靠近父神，许多人还直接靠近圣灵，却鲜有人直接靠近主。犹太人由于否认主是弥赛亚，神的儿子而将祂钉在十字架上，故他们的耶路撒冷也被称为“所多玛”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.9.htm">3:9</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.14.htm">23:14</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.46.htm">16:46</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.48.htm">48</a>）。并且主说：</p><p>那日，罗得从所多玛出来，从天上降下火和硫磺，把他们全都灭了；人子显现的日子也要这样。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.29.htm">17:29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.30.htm">30</a>）</p><p>从前面可以看出“火和硫磺”是什么意思（<a href="452.htm">452</a>，<a href="494.htm">494</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 504</h4><p>504. Where also our Lord was crucified. This symbolizes a failure to acknowledge the Lord's Divine humanity, and thus a state in which He is rejected.<p>It is a saying in the church that people who blaspheme the Lord, crucify Him, and that so, too, do those who, like the Jews, deny that He is the Son of God.<p>People who deny that the Lord's humanity is Divine are like Jews because everyone views the Lord as a person, and anyone who views His humanity as on par with the humanity of any other person is incapable then of thinking of His Divinity, no matter how often this is called the Son of God, born from eternity, coequal with the Divinity of the Father. When he is told this or hears it read, it penetrates his hearing, indeed, but not at the same time his belief, since he thinks of the Lord as being a material person like any other man, retaining the same properties of the flesh. And because he then sets the Lord's Divinity aside and pays it no attention, he is therefore in the same state as he would be if he denied it; for he denies that the Lord's humanity is the Son of God, even as the Jews did also, for which reason they crucified Him. That the Lord's humanity is nevertheless the Son of God is something plainly said in <a href="3927/luke_1_32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">35</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_3_16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>, and elsewhere.</p><p>[2] It is apparent from this why people in the church turn directly to God the Father, and many also to the Holy Spirit, and rarely anyone directly to the Lord.<p>Since the Jews crucified the Lord owing to their denial that He was the Messiah, the Son of God, therefore their Jerusalem is also called Sodom (<a href="3927/isaiah_3_9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_23_14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_48.htm">48</a>). And the Lord says,<p>On the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. Even so will it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed. (<a href="3927/luke_17_29.htm">Luke 17:29-30</a>)<p>What the fire and brimstone are may be seen in no. <a href="452.htm">452</a>, <a href="494.htm">494</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 504</h4><p>504. 'Where also our Lord was crucified' signifies no acknowledgment of the Lord's Divine Human, and thus a state of rejection. It is said in the Church that they 'crucify the Lord' who blaspheme Him, as do those also, like the Jews, who deny Him to be the Son of God. The reason why those who deny that His Human is Divine are like the Jews is that every man regards the Lord as a man, and one who regards His Human as equal to the human of another man cannot then think of His Divine, howsoever this is said to be the Son of God, born from eternity, equal to the Divine of the Father. When this is being stated and read it is indeed heard, but yet it is not at the same time in the faith when concerning the Lord it is thought that He is a material man like another man, equally retaining the properties of the flesh; and as he then removes His Divine and does not regard it, he is in the same state as if he denied it, for he denies that His Human is the Son of God, just as the Jews also did, for which reason they crucified Him. That nevertheless the Lord's Human is the Son of God is openly said (<a href="3927/luke_1_32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">35</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_3_16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>, and elsewhere).</p><p>[2] In consequence of these things the reason is plain why the men of the Church approach God the Father directly, and many also the Holy Spirit directly, but seldom does anyone approach the Lord directly. Since the Jews, because of denying the Lord to be the Messiah the Son of God, crucified Him, therefore their Jerusalem is also called Sodom (<a href="3927/isaiah_3_9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_23_14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_48.htm">48</a>); and the Lord says:<p>On the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and sulphur out of heaven, and destroyed them all; even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man shall be revealed. <a href="3927/luke_17_29.htm">Luke 17:29-30</a>.<p>What 'fire and sulphur' [signify], may be seen (<a href="452.htm">452</a>, <a href="494.htm">494</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 504</h4><p>504. Where also our Lord was crucified, signifies non-acknowledgment of the Lord's Divine Human, and thus a state of rejection. It is said in the church, that they "crucify the Lord" who blaspheme Him; as do those also who, like the Jews, deny Him to be the Son of God. The reason why they who deny the Lord's Human to be Divine are like the Jews is because every man regards the Lord as a Man, and he who regards His Human as like the human of another man cannot then think of His Divine, howsoever he may call this the Son of God, born from eternity, and equal to the Divine of the Father. When it is spoken and read, it is heard indeed, but still it is not at the same time believed; when the Lord is thought of as a material man like any other man, and retaining the like properties of the flesh; and as His Divine is then removed and not regarded, therefore the same state is induced as if it were denied, for he denies that His Human is the Son of God, as did the Jews, for which reason they crucified Him. That the Lord's Human is nevertheless the Son of God, is openly said (in <a href="3927/luke_1_32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">35</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_3_16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>; and in other places).</p><p>[2] From these things it appears, why the men of the church approach God the Father immediately, and many also the Holy Spirit immediately, but scarcely anyone approaches the Lord immediately. Since the Jews, from the denial that the Lord was the Messiah, the Son of God, crucified Him, therefore their Jerusalem is also called Sodom, (<a href="3927/isaiah_3_9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_23_14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_48.htm">48</a>). And the Lord says:<p>On the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all; even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed, (<a href="3927/luke_17_29.htm">Luke 17:29-30</a>).<p>What is meant by fire and brimstone may be seen above, (<a href="452.htm">452</a>, <a href="494.htm">494</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 504 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>504. "Ubi et Dominus noster crucifixus est," significat non agnitionem Divini Humani Domini, et sic statum rejectionis. - In Ecclesia dicitur, quod illi "crucifigant Dominum" qui blasphemant Ipsum; tum etiam qui, sicut Judaei, negant Ipsum esse Filium Dei; quod Judaeis similes sint illi qui negant quod Humanum Ipsius sit Divinum, est quia omnis homo spectat Dominum ut Hominem, et qui Humanum Ipsius spectat aequale humano alterius hominis, non potest tunc cogitare Divinum Ipsius, utcunque Hoc dicitur Filius Dei, natum ab aeterno, aequale Divino Patris. Hoc cum dicitur et legitur, quidem auditur, sed usque non simul in fide est, cum cogitatur de Domino quod sit homo materialis sicut alius homo, retinens pares proprietates carnis: et quia tunc removet Divinum Ipsius et non spectat illud, ideo in eo statu est, sicut neget illud nam negat quod Humanum Ipsius sit Filius Dei, sicut etiam fecerunt Judaei, ac propterea crucifixerunt Ipsum. Quod tamen Humanum Domini sit Filius Dei, aperte dicitur, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_504/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_1_32" target=_top>Luca 1:32</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_504/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_1_35" target=_top>35</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_504/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_3_16-17" target=_top>Matthaeus 3:16-17</a>; et alibi). Ex his patet causa, cur homines Ecclesiae immediate adeunt Deum Patrem, ac multi etiam immediate Spiritum Sanctum, et raro aliquis immediate Dominum. Quoniam Judaei, ex negatione quod Dominus esset Messias Filius Dei, crucifixerunt Ipsum, ideo Hierosolyma illorum etiam vocatur Sodoma, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_504/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_3_9" target=_top>Esaias 3:9</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_504/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_23_14" target=_top>Jeremias 23:14</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_504/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_16_46" target=_top>Ezechiel 16:46</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_504/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_16_48" target=_top>48</a>); ac Dominus dicit, <p>"Qua die egressus est Lothus e Sodoma, pluit igne et sulphure e Caelo, et perdidit omnes; juxta haec fiet, qua die Filius Hominis revelabitur," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_504/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_17_29-30" target=_top>Luca 17:29-30</a>);<p>quid "ignis et sulphur," videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_504/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_452" target=_top>452</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_504/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_494" target=_top>494</a>. </p>
