<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第124节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>124.“你要写信给推雅推喇教会的天使说”表写给并涉及那些处于源自仁之信、因而处于善行之人；还写给并涉及那些处于脱离仁之信、因而处于恶行之人。“推雅推喇教会”既描述前者，也描述后者。这从写给该教会的话明显可知，不过，这些话要照着灵义来理解。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 124</h4><p>124. "And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write." (<a href="3927/revelation_2_18.htm">2:18</a>) This symbolically means, to people and concerning people who are governed by a faith arising from charity, and so are engaged in good works; and also to people and concerning people who are governed by a faith divorced from charity, and so are engaged in evil works.<p>That people of the one character and the other are meant by the church in Thyatira is apparent from the particulars written to it, understood in their spiritual meaning. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 124</h4><p>124. [verse 18] 'And to the Angel of the Church in Thyatira write' signifies to and concerning those who are in a faith derived from charity, and thence in good works; and also to and concerning those who are in a faith separated from charity, and thence in evil works. That the latter and the former are described by the Church of the Thyatirans is plain from the things written to it understood in the spiritual sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 124</h4><p>124. Verse 18. And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write, signifies, to those and concerning those, who are in faith from charity, and thence in good works; and also to those and concerning those, who are in faith separate from charity, and thence in evil works. That both the former and latter are described by "the church in Thyatira," is evident from what is written to it, when understood in the spiritual sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 124 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>124. (Vers. 18.) "Et Angelo in Thyatiris Ecclesiae scribe" significat ad illos et de illis, qui in fide ex charitate sunt, et inde in bonis operibus; et quoque ad illis et de illis, qui in fide separata a charitate sunt, et inde in malis operibus. - Quod hi et illi per "Thyatiriensium Ecclesiam" describantur, patet a scriptis ad illam in Sensu spirituali intellectis. </p>
