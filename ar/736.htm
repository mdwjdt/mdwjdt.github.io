<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第736节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>736.启17:9.“这就是有智慧的心思”表这是属世意义上的解释，但是为了那些处于来自主的属灵意义之人。“这就是心思”表示这就是对那些所看到的事物的理解和解释；“有智慧的”表示为了那些有内在智慧的人。属世意义上的解释之所以是为了那些处于属灵意义的人，是因为天使所作的解释是属世意义上的，而非属灵意义上的；他说那兽的七头就是“七座山”，同样说“又是七位王”；“一位还在，一位还没有来到”；还说那兽“是第八位，和那七位同列”；此外还有接下来直至本章结束的更多事；只有那些处于来自主的属灵意义的人才能理解这些事；因此，这一点由“有智慧”来表示。天使之所以以属世意义，而非以属灵意义来解释，是因为属世意义是其属灵和属天意义的基础、容器和支撑；对此，可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/27.htm">27</a>-49节）。因此，圣言其它地方也给出了属世意义上的解释；若不藉着属灵意义，它们仍无法从内在被理解；这一点可见于先知书和福音书的许多地方。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 736</h4><p>736. <a href="3927/revelation_17_9.htm">17:9</a> "This is the mind which has wisdom." This symbolically means that this is the interpretation in the natural sense, but intended for people who have the spiritual meaning from the Lord.<p>This is the mind means symbolically that this is the meaning and interpretation of the things seen. Which has wisdom means symbolically that it is for people who are interiorly wise.<p>This is the interpretation in the natural sense for people who have the spiritual meaning because the interpretation given by the angel was put in terms of the natural sense and not the spiritual sense, for he said that the beast's seven heads were seven mountains, and also that they were seven kings, and that one of them is, and the other has not yet come. He said, too, that the beast was the eighth, and of the seven, and so on with everything else he said to the end of the chapter. None of this can be understood except by people who have the spiritual meaning from the Lord. This, then, is what the mind's having wisdom means symbolically.<p>The interpretation given by the angel was put in terms of the natural sense and not the spiritual meaning because the natural sense is the foundation, containing vessel, and buttress of its spiritual and celestial senses, as may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="../ss/27.htm">27-49</a>. Therefore interpretations elsewhere in the Word are given also in terms of the natural sense, which still cannot be understood without the spiritual meaning, as may be seen in many places in the Prophets and also in the Gospels. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 736</h4><p>736. [verse 9] 'This is the mind having wisdom' signifies that this interpretation is in the natural sense but is for those who are in the spiritual sense from the Lord. 'This is the mind' signifies that this is the understanding and interpretation of the things that have been seen. 'Having wisdom' signifies for those who are wise interiorly. That it is an interpretation in the natural sense for those who are in the spiritual sense is because the interpretation is made by the angel in the natural and not in the spiritual sense, for he said that the seven heads of the beast were 'seven mountains,' and also that they were 'seven kings,' and that 'one of them is' and 'another is not yet come,' also that the beast 'is the eighth and is of the seven,' besides more things that follow up to the end of the chapter; and these things cannot be understood except by those who are in the spiritual sense from the Lord. This therefore is signified by 'having wisdom.' That the interpretation by the angel was made in the natural and not in the spiritual sense is because the natural sense is the basis, the containant and the support of the spiritual and celestial senses thereof, as may be seen in <a href="../ss/27.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 27-49</a>. For this reason also the interpretations elsewhere in the Word have been given in the natural sense, and these still cannot be understood interiorly except by means of the spiritual sense, as can be seen in the case of the Prophets, and also the Evangelists, in many places. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 736</h4><p>736. Verse 9. Here is the mind that hath wisdom, signifies that this is the interpretation in the natural sense, but for those who are in the spiritual sense from the Lord. "Here is the mind" signifies that this is the understanding and interpretation of those things that were seen: "that hath wisdom" signifies for those that are interiorly wise. That the interpretation is in the natural sense for those who are in the spiritual sense, is because the interpretation was made by the angel in the natural sense, and not in the spiritual; for he said that the seven heads of the beast were "seven mountains," and likewise that "they were seven kings;" and that "one of them is, and another is not yet come;" also that the beast "is the eighth, and is of the seven;" besides more things which follow even to the end of the chapter; and these things cannot be understood except by those who are in the spiritual sense from the Lord; this is therefore signified by "having wisdom." The reason that the interpretation was made by the angel in the natural sense, and not in the spiritual, is because the natural sense is the basis, the containant and the support of its spiritual and celestial sense; see <a href="../ss/27.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture 27-49</a>. Therefore also elsewhere in the Word interpretations are given in the natural sense; and still they cannot be understood interiorly except by the spiritual sense: as may be seen in the prophets, and also in the evangelists, in many places. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 736 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>736. (Vere. 9.) "Haec mens, habens sapientiam," significat quod haec interpretatio sit in Sensu naturali, sed pro illis qui in Sensu spirituali a Domino sunt. -"Haec mens" significat quod hoc sit intellectus et interpretatio illorum quae visa sunt; "habens sapientiam" significat pro illis qui interius sapiunt. Quod sit interpretatio in Sensu naturali pro illis qui in Sensu spirituali sunt, est quia interpretatio ab Angelo facta est in Sensu naturali et non in spirituali: dixit enim quod septem capita Bestiae "septem montes essent," et quoque quod "septem reges sint," et quod "ex illis unus sit, et alter nondum venerit," tum quod Bestia "sit octavus et de septem," praeter plura quae sequuntur usque ad finem capitis: et haec non possunt intelligi nisi ab illis qui in Sensu spirituali a Domino sunt; ideo id per "habentem sapientiam" significatur. Quod interpretatio ab Angelo facta sit in Sensu naturali et non in spirituali, est quia Sensus naturalis est basis, continens et firmamentum Sensus spiritualis et caelestis ejus, videatur Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_736/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_27" target=_top>27-49</a>); quare etiam interpretationes alibi in Verbo datae sunt in Sensu naturali, quae usque non possunt interius intelligi nisi per Sensum spiritualem, ut videri potest apud Prophetas, et quoque apud Evangelistas multis in locis. </p>
