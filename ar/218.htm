<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第218节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>218.“若有听见我声音就开门的”表凡相信圣言并照之生活的人（<a href="218.htm">218</a>节）。“听我声音”是指相信圣言，因为圣言的神性真理就是“耶和华的声音”（<a href="37.htm">37</a>，<a href="50.htm">50</a>节）；“开门”是指照圣言生活，因为若只是听见声音，却不照之生活，门是不会打开，使得主被接受的，因为主说：</p><p>有了我的命令又遵守的，我要将自己显现给他，并且我要到他那里去，与他同住。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.21.htm">14:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.24.htm">24</a>）</p><p>人当通过避恶如罪并行善而貌似凭自己打开门，这在《新耶路撒冷的生活教义》一书有所说明；这一事实也可从主在此处的话，即“若有听见我声音就开门的”，以及主在路加福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.36.htm">12:36</a>）的话明显看出来。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 218</h4><p>218. "'If anyone hears My voice and opens the door.'" This symbolically means anyone who believes the Word and lives according to it.<p>To hear His voice is to believe the Word, for the Word's Divine truth is the voice of Jehovah (nos. <a href="37.htm">37</a>, <a href="50.htm">50</a>). And to open the door is to live according to the Word, since one opens the door and receives the Lord not only by hearing His voice, but by living according to it. For the Lord says,<p>He who has My commandments and keeps them..., I will... manifest Myself to him..., and (I) will come to him and make (My) abode with him. (<a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>)<p>In The Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem we showed that a person ought to open the door as though on his own, by refraining from evils as sins and doing good acts; and that this is the case is apparent from the Lord's words in the present verse, "If anyone... opens the door," as well as from His words in <a href="3927/luke_12_36.htm">Luke 12:36</a>. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Quoted in no. <a href="217.htm">217</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 218</h4><p>218. 'If anyone hears My voice and opens [the door]' signifies he who believes in the Word and lives in accordance with it. 'To hear the voice' is to believe in the Word, for the Divine truth of the Word is 'the voice of Jehovah' (<a href="37.htm">37</a>, so); and 'to open the door (ostium)' is to live in accordance with it, since the door is not opened, nor is the Lord received, by only hearing the voice, but by living in accordance with it, for the Lord says:<p>He who has My commandments and does them, I will manifest Myself to him, and come unto him, and make an abode with him. <a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>.<p>That a man ought to open the door as from himself, by fleeing from evils as sins and by doing goods, has been shown in THE DOCTRINE OF LIFE FOR THE NEW JERUSALEM; and that it is in such a manner is plain also from the Lord's words here, 'If any one opens,' and again from His words [in]. <a href="3927/luke_12_36.htm">Luke 12:36</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 218</h4><p>218. If anyone hear my voice, and open the door, signifies he who believes in the Word and lives according to it. "To hear His voice," is to believe in the Word, for the Divine truth of the Word is "the voice of Jehovah" (<a href="37.htm">37</a>, <a href="50.htm">50</a>); and "to open the door" is to live according to it, because the door is not opened, and the Lord received, by merely hearing the voice, but by living according to it, for the Lord says:<p>He that hath My commandments, and doeth them, I will manifest Myself to him, and I will come unto him and make an abode with him, (<a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>).<p>That man ought to open the door as from himself, by shunning evils as sins, and doing goods, is shown in The Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem; and that this is the case, is also evident from the Lord's words here, "If anyone open;" as also from His words in <a href="3927/luke_12_36.htm">Luke 12:36</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 218 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>218. "Si quis audiverit vocem Meam, et aperuerit (ostium)," significat qui credit Verbo et vivit secundum illud. - "Audire vocem" est credere Verbo, nam Divinum verum Verbi est "vox Jehovae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_218/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_37" target=_top>37</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_218/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_50" target=_top>50</a>); et "aperire ostium" est vivere secundum illud, quoniam non aperitur ostium, et recipitur Dominus, per solum audire vocem, sed per vivere secundum illam; dicit enim Dominus, <p>"Qui habet praecepta Mea et facit illa, ei manifestabo Me Ipsum, et ad illum veniam, et mansionem apud illum faciam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_218/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_21-24" target=_top>Johannes 14:21-24</a>).<p>Quod homo aperire debeat ostium sicut a se, fugiendo mala ut peccata et faciendo bona, in Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma ostensum est; et quod ita sit, patet etiam a verbis Domini hic, "si quis aperuerit;" tum a verbis Ipsius, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_218/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_12_36" target=_top>Luca 12:36</a>. </p>
