<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第853节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>853.“第二次的死在这些人身上没有权柄”表示他们没有被罚入地狱。“第二次的死”无非表示属灵的死亡，也就是罚入地狱；因为第一次的死是属世的死亡，就是肉体的死亡；但第二次的死是属灵的死亡，就是灵魂的死亡，众所周知，这死就是被罚入地狱。而且，由于第二次的死是罚入地狱，第一次的死是离世，后一种死不是属灵的；所以启示录中无一处提到“第一次的死”，而本章14节经文再次提到“第二次的死”；后面的经文（｛21:8）和前面的经文（｛2:11）同样提到“第二次的死”。人若没有发现这一点，很可能以为有两次属灵的死亡，因为经上说“第二次的死”，而事实上，属灵的死亡只有一次，就是此处“第二次的死”所指的；同样可能以为有两次复活，因为经上说“头一次的复活”，而事实上，复活也只有一次，所以经上没有一处提到“第二次复活”（参看<a href="851.htm">851</a>节）。由此明显可知，“第二次的死在这些人身上没有权柄”表示他们没有被罚入地狱。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 853</h4><p>853. Over such the second death has no power. This symbolically means that the people described do not suffer damnation.<p>The second death has no other symbolic meaning than spiritual death, which is damnation. For the first death is natural death, which is a death of the body. But the second death is spiritual death, which is a death of the soul, and this is damnation, as people know. Moreover, because the second death is damnation, and the first death is a transition, a death that is not a spiritual one, therefore nowhere in the book of Revelation is the first death mentioned, but only the second death, which is mentioned here and in verse <a href="3927/revelation_20_14.htm">14</a> in this chapter, and in the following chapter <a href="3927/revelation_21_8.htm">21:8</a>, and also earlier in chapter 2, <a href="3927/revelation_2_11.htm">2:11</a>.<p>Someone who does not notice this may easily believe that there are two spiritual deaths, because reference is made to a second death, even though there is only one spiritual death, which is here meant by the second death. He may likewise believe that there are two resurrections, because reference is made to a first resurrection, even though there is only one resurrection, as may be seen in no. <a href="851.htm">851</a> above, which is why a second resurrection is nowhere mentioned.<p>It is apparent from this that "over such the second death has no power" symbolically means that the people described do not suffer damnation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 853</h4><p>853. 'Upon these the second death has no authority' signifies that they do not suffer damnation. By 'the second death' is signified nothing else but spiritual death, which is damnation; for the first death is the natural death that is the death of the body, but the second death is the spiritual death that is the death of the soul, which is known to be damnation. Also, because the second death is damnation and the first is decease, this death not being spiritual, therefore the first death is not mentioned anywhere in the Apocalypse, but the second death is mentioned again in this chapter (verse 14), then in the following chapter (<a href="3927/revelation_21_8.htm">21:8</a>), and also earlier on (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_2_11.htm">2:11</a>). He who does not notice this can easily believe that there are two spiritual deaths because it is said 'the second deaths,' when yet there is but the one spiritual death that is understood here by 'the second death.' He can likewise believe that there are two resurrections because 'the first resurrection' is mentioned, when yet there can be only the one resurrection; and therefore a second resurrection is not mentioned anywhere, as may be seen above (<a href="851.htm">851</a>). From these considerations it is plain that by 'upon these the second death has no authority' is signified that they do not suffer damnation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 853</h4><p>853. Upon these the second death hath no power, signifies that they are not condemned. By "the second death" nothing else is signified but spiritual death, which is damnation; for the first death is natural death, which is the death of the body; but the second death is spiritual death, which is the death of the soul, and that this is damnation is known. And since the second death is damnation, and the first death is the decease, and this latter death is not spiritual, therefore the first death is nowhere mentioned in the Apocalypse, but the second death spoken of again in this chapter, verse 14; also in the following, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_8.htm">21:8</a>), and likewise before, (<a href="3927/revelation_2_11.htm">2:11</a>). He who does not observe this, may readily believe that there are two spiritual deaths, because it is said "the second death," when nevertheless there is only one spiritual death, which is here meant by "the second death;" and in like manner that there are two resurrections, because it is said "the first resurrection," when yet there is only one resurrection, wherefore neither is there any second resurrection mentioned, see above, (<a href="851.htm">851</a>). Hence it is evident that by "On these the second death hath no power," is signified that they are not condemned. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 853 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>853. "Super hos mors altera non habet potestatem," significat quod illis non damnatio. -Per "mortem alteram" non aliud significatur quam mors spiritualis, quae est damnatio: mors enim prima est mors naturalis, quae est mors corporis; mors autem altera est mors spiritualis, quae est mors animae, quae quod sit damnatio, notum est. Et quia mors altera est damnatio, et mors prima est obitus, et haec mors non est spiritualis, ideo nullibi in Apocalypsi nominatur mors prima, sed mors altera in hoc capite (etiam vers. 14), tum in sequente, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_853/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_8" target=_top>21:8</a>), et quoque prius, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_853/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_2_11" target=_top>2:11</a>). Qui hoc non observat, potest facile credere quod binae mortes spirituales sint, quia dicitur "mors altera," cum tamen non est nisi quam una mors spiritualis, quae hic intelligitur per "mortem alteram;" similiter quod dentur binae resurrectiones, quia dicitur "resurrectio prima," cum tamen non detur nisi quam una resurrectio; quare nec ullibi dicitur resurrectio secunda (videatur supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_853/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_851" target=_top>851</a>). Ex his patet, quod per "super hos mors altera non habet potestatem" significetur quod illis non damnatio. </p>
