<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第307节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>307.“使他们彼此相杀”表内在的憎恨、地狱的侵扰和内在的不安。当“夺去太平”表示夺去仁爱、属灵的安全、内在的安息，并且“红马”表示在良善方面完全丧失对圣言的理解时，所表示的就是这些事物；因为当良善不复存在时，这些事物就存在；当人们不知道何为良善时，良善就不复存在。当没有仁爱时，内在的憎恨便存在；同样，当没有属灵的安全时，地狱的侵扰就存在；当没有从邪恶及其欲望中止息时，内在的不安就存在；即便在世上不是这样，死后必是这种情形。“杀”具有这种含义，可从下文“剑”的含义明显看出来。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 307</h4><p>307. So that people might kill one another. This symbolizes intestine hatreds, infestations by the hells, and inner anxieties.<p>These are symbolized inasmuch as to take peace from the earth means, symbolically, to take away charity, spiritual security, and inner rest, and a fiery red horse symbolizes an understanding of the Word extinguished as to goodness. For these result when there is no more goodness, and there is no more goodness when people do not know what good is.<p>It is apparent that intestine hatreds occur when there is no charity, that infestations by the hells occur when there is no spiritual security, and that inner anxieties occur when there is no rest from evils and their lusts. But they occur after death, if not before in the world.<p>That to kill has this symbolic meaning follows from the symbolism of a sword, which is the subject next. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 307</h4><p>307. 'So that they should slay one another' signifies intestine hatreds, infestations from the hells, and internal unrests. These things are signified when by 'to take away peace' is signified to take away charity, spiritual security, and internal rest, and when by a 'red horse' is signified the understanding of the Word utterly lost as to good; for those [states] exist when there is no longer any good, and there is no longer any good when it is not known what good is. That intestine hatreds exist when there is no charity, also infestations from the hells when there is no spiritual security, and that internal unrests exist when there is no rest from evils and their lusts, is plain; at least, this is the case after death, if not in the world. That 'to slay' signifies those things is established from the signification of the 'sword' concerning which [something] follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 307</h4><p>307. And that they should kill one another, signifies intestine hatreds, infestations from the hells, and internal restlessness. These things are signified, when by "taking away peace" is signified taking away charity, spiritual security, and internal rest, and when by "the red horse" is signified the understanding of the Word destroyed as to good; for these things exist when there is no longer any good; and there is no longer any good when it is not known what good is. That intestine hatreds exist when there is no charity, likewise infestations by the hells when there is no spiritual security, and internal restlessness when there is no rest from evils and their lusts, is evident; but this is the case after death, if not in the world. That "to kill" has such a signification, is plain from the signification of "a sword," in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 307 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>307. "Ut alii alios occiderent" significat intestina odia, infestationes ab Infernis, et irrequies internas. - Haec significantur, cum per "tollere pacem" significatur tollere charitatem, Securitatem spiritualem, et requiem internam, et cum per "equum rufum" significatur intellectus Verbi deperditus quoad bonum: nam illa sunt cum non amplius est bonum, et non amplius est bonum cum non scitur quid bonum. Quod odia intestina sint cum non charitas, tum infestationes ab Infernis cum non securitas spiritualis, et quod irrequies internae cum non requies a malis et eorum concupiscentiis, patet; at haec post mortem, si non in mundo. Quod "occidere" illa significet, constat a significatione "machaerae," de qua sequitur. </p>
