<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第935节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>935.“每月都结果子”表主照人里面真理的各个状态而在他里面产生良善。“月”表示人在真理上的生命状态，如下文所述。“结果子”表示产生良善；“果子”表示爱与仁的良善，如刚才所示（<a href="934.htm">934</a>节）；由于本质上是主在人里面产生良善，尽管人貌似凭自己、因而表面上产生它们，如前所述（<a href="934.htm">934</a>节），故显而易见，这句话表示主在至内层或核心处时，便从这至内层或核心处产生它们。不过，有必要阐明当如同理解这句话，即：主照人里面的真理状态而在他里面产生仁之良善。若里面没有来自圣言的真理，却以为人行出的良善是主所悦纳的，也就是所谓的属灵良善，就大大受骗了。对人来说，没有真理的良善并非良善，没有良善的真理也并非真理，尽管它们本身可能是真理；因为没有真理的良善就像人没有理解力的意志，这种意志不是人的，而像兽的，或像技工所操纵的木偶的。但意志与理性一起就会照着它藉以存在的理解状态而变成人。因为每个人的生命状态具有这样的性质，他的意愿若不经由理解或认知，就什么也做不了，理解或认知若不通过意愿就什么也思考不了。良善与真理也一样，因为良善属于意愿，真理属于理解或认知。</p><p>由此明显可知，主在人里面所产生的良善取决于他里面的真理状态，也就是他的理解力。这就是“生命树每月结果子”的含义，因为“月”表示人里面的真理状态。所有时间，也就是小时、天、周、月、年、世纪，皆表示生命的状态（参看<a href="476.htm">476</a>，<a href="562.htm">562</a>节）。生命在真理上的状态之所以由“月”来表示，是因为“月”是指由月亮所决定的时间，而“月亮”表示理解或认知和信仰的真理（<a href="332.htm">332</a>，<a href="413.htm">413</a>，<a href="414.htm">414</a>，<a href="919.htm">919</a>节）。在以下经文中，“月”所表相同：</p><p>愿约瑟的地蒙耶和华赐福，得太阳出产的宝物和月亮出产的宝物。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.13.htm">33:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.14.htm">14</a>）</p><p>从月到月，从安息日到安息日，凡有血气的必来在耶和华面前下拜。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.23.htm">66:23</a>）</p><p>由于“月”，也就是月亮的度量具有这种含义，所以：</p><p>他们在每月或新月的开始献祭。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.1.htm">29:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.26.htm">26</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.14.htm">1:14</a>）</p><p>那时，以色列人还吹号。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.10.htm">10:10</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗81.3.htm">81:3</a>）</p><p>他们被吩咐要守亚笔月，在那时守逾越节。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.2.htm">12:2</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.1.htm">16:1</a>）</p><p>“月”表示人里面的真理状态，在反面意义表示他里面的虚假状态，可参看启示录》（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.5.htm">9:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.2.htm">11:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.5.htm">13:5</a>）。以西结书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.12.htm">47:12</a>）中的“月”所表相同。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 935</h4><p>935. Yielding its fruit according to the month. This symbolically means that the Lord produces the goods in a person in accordance with every state of truth in him.<p>A month symbolizes a person's state of life in respect to truth, as will be seen below. To yield fruit means, symbolically, to produce goods. That fruits are goods of love and charity is something we just showed in no. <a href="934.htm">934</a> above. Moreover, because it is the Lord who essentially produces these in a person - even though the person does them as though of himself, thus apparently, as we said in no. <a href="934.htm">934</a> above - it follows that the symbolic meaning here is that the Lord produces them inmostly when He is present there.<p>But we must say how one is to understand the Lord's producing goods of charity in a person in accordance with every state of truth in him.<p>Someone who believes that a person does good acceptable to the Lord, good that is called spiritual good, without possessing in him truths from the Word, is much mistaken. Goods without truths are not good, and truths without goods are not true in the person, even though they are true in themselves. For good without truth is like something a person wills without understanding, a volition that is not human, but one like that of an animal, or like that of a robot that an operator causes to function.<p>On the other hand, volition together with comprehension becomes human in accordance with the state of the intellect by which it finds expression. For the condition of everyone's life is such that a person's will can do nothing without the instrumentality of the intellect, nor can the intellect entertain any thought without doing so from the will. The case is the same with goodness and truth, since goodness has to do with the will, and truth with the intellect.</p><p>[2] It is apparent from this that the good that the Lord produces in a person accords with the state of truth in him that forms his understanding.<p>This is what the tree of life yielding its fruit every month symbolizes, because a month symbolizes the state of truth in a person.<p>All periods of time, such as hours, days, weeks, months, years, and centuries, symbolize states of life, as may be seen in nos. <a href="476.htm">476</a>, <a href="562.htm">562</a>. Months symbolize states of life in respect to truths, because months mean times determined by the moon, and the moon symbolizes the truth of the intellect and of faith (nos. <a href="332.htm">332</a>, <a href="413.htm">413</a>, <a href="414.htm">414</a>, <a href="919.htm">919</a>).<p>Months have the same meaning in the following:<p>Blessed of Jehovah is (Joseph's) land..., with the precious fruits of the sun, and with the precious produce of the months... (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13-14</a>)<p>It shall come to pass that from month to month, and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh shall come to bow down before (Jehovah).... (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a>)<p>Because of the symbolic meaning of a month, which is the same as that of the moon, sacrifices were made at the beginnings of each month or new moon (<a href="3927/numbers_29_1.htm">Numbers 29:1-6</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_1_14.htm">Isaiah 1:14</a>). The Israelites also sounded the trumpets then (<a href="3927/numbers_10_10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_81_3.htm">Psalms 81:3</a>). And they were commanded to observe the month of Abib, in which they celebrated Passover (<a href="3927/exodus_12_2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_16_1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1</a>).<p>Months symbolize states of truth in a person, and in an opposite sense states of falsity in him, as may also be seen above in <a href="3927/revelation_9_5.htm">Revelation 9:5</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_9_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_9_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_11_2.htm">11:2</a>, and <a href="3927/revelation_13_5.htm">13:5</a>.<p>A month has the same symbolic meaning here as in <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 935</h4><p>935. 'Each month yielding its own fruit' signifies that the Lord produces goods with the man in accordance with every state of truth with him. By 'a month' is signified a man's state of life as to truth, concerning which [something] follows. By 'to yield fruit' is signified to produce goods. That 'fruits' are the goods of love and charity has been shown just above (<a href="934.htm">934</a>); and because the Lord produces these with the man essentially, although the man does them as from himself, thus apparently, as was said above (<a href="934.htm">934</a>), it is established that it is signified that the Lord produces them out of the inmost, while He is there. But it shall be stated how this is to be understood, that the Lord produces the goods of charity with the man in accordance with the state of truth with him. He who believes that a man does the good taken from the Lord, which is called spiritual good, is much deceived, unless there are with him truths from the Word. Goods without truths are not good, and truths without good are not true with the man, although in themselves they are true. For good without truth is like a man's voluntary without the understanding, this voluntary being not human, but like that of a beast or like a carved statue made to work by a craftsman. But the voluntary together with the intellectual becomes human in accordance with the state of the understanding by means of which it comes into existence. For the state of life with every man is such that his will cannot do anything except by means of the understanding, nor can the understanding think anything except by virtue of the will. It is similar with good and truth, since good is of the will and truth is of the understanding.</p><p>[2] From these considerations it is plain that the good that the Lord produces with a man is in accordance with the state of truth with him from which the understanding is derived. The reason why this is signified by [the statement] that the tree of life 'each month yields its own fruit' is because by 'a month' is signified the state of truth with a man. That states of life are signified by all times, which are hours, days, weeks, months, years, ages, may be seen (<a href="476.htm">476</a>, <a href="562.htm">562</a>). The reason why by 'months' are signified states of life as to truths is because by 'months 'are understood the times determined by the moon, and by 'the moon' is signified the truth of the understanding and of faith (<a href="332.htm">332</a>, <a href="413.htm">413-414</a>, <a href="919.htm">919</a>). Similar things are understood by 'months' in these passages:<p>Blessed by Jehovah is the land of Joseph, in respect of the precious things of the products of the sun, and of the precious things of the products of the months. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_14.htm">Deuteronomy 33:14</a>,<p>It shall come to pass from month to month, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to bow before Jehovah. <a href="3927/isaiah_66_23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a>.<p>On account of the signification of 'a month,' which is a lunar measure, 'sacrifices were made at the beginning of each month or of the new moon' (<a href="3927/numbers_29_6.htm">Numbers 29:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_1_14.htm">Isaiah 1:14</a>). And then also they used 'to sound the trumpets' (<a href="3927/numbers_10_10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_81_3.htm">Psalms 81:3</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_81_4.htm">4</a>]); and it was commanded that 'they should observe the month Abib, in which they used to celebrate the Passover' (<a href="3927/exodus_12_2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_16_1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1</a>). By 'months' are signified states of truth, and in the opposite sense states of untruth with a man, in the Apocalypse above also (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_9_5.htm">9:5</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_9_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_9_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_11_2.htm">11:2</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_13_5.htm">13:5</a>). Something similar to what is here is signified by 'month' in <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 935</h4><p>935. Yielding its fruit every month, signifies that the Lord produces good with man according to every state of truth with him. By "a month" is signified the state of man's life as to truth, as will be shown presently. By "yielding fruit" is signified to produce goods; that "fruits" are the goods of love and charity was shown just above, (<a href="934.htm">934</a>); and because the Lord produces them with man essentially, though the man does them as of himself, and thus apparently, as was said above, (<a href="934.htm">934</a>), it is evident that it is signified that the Lord produces them from the inmost, when He is there. But it shall be told how it is to be understood, that the Lord produces the goods of charity with a man according to the state of truth with Him. He who believes that a man does good that is acceptable to the Lord, which is called spiritual good, unless there are truths from the Word in Him, is much deceived. Goods without truths are not goods, and truths without goods are not truths with man, although in themselves they may be truths; for good without truth is like the voluntary of man without the understanding, which voluntary is not human, but is like a beast's, or like that of a carved image which an artificer causes to operate. But the voluntary together with the intellectual becomes human according to the state of the understanding by which it exists. For the state of life of every man is such that his will cannot do anything except through the understanding, nor can the understanding think anything except from the will. It is similar with good and truth, since good is of the will, and truth is of the understanding.</p><p>[2] It is manifest from this, that the good which the Lord produces with man is according to the state of the truth with him from which is his understanding. That this is signified by "the tree of life yielding its fruit every month," is because the state of truth with man is signified by month. That states of life are signified by all times, which are hours, days, weeks, months, years, ages, may be seen, (<a href="476.htm">476</a>, <a href="562.htm">562</a>). That states of life as to truths, are signified by "months," is because the times determined by the moon are meant by "months," and truth of the understanding and of faith is signified by "the moon" (<a href="332.htm">332</a>, <a href="413.htm">413</a>, <a href="414.htm">414</a>, <a href="919.htm">919</a>). Similar things are meant by months in these passages:<p>Blessed of Jehovah is the land of Joseph for the precious things of the produce of the sun, and for the precious things of the produce of the months, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13-14</a>).<p>It shall come to pass that from month to month, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to bow themselves down before Jehovah, (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a>).<p>On account of the signification of "month," which is that of the moon:<p>They made sacrifices at the beginning of every month or of the new moon, (<a href="3927/numbers_29_1.htm">Numbers 29:1-6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_1_14.htm">Isaiah 1:14</a>).<p>And then also they sounded with the trumpets, (<a href="3927/numbers_10_10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_81_3.htm">Psalms 81:3</a>).<p>And it was commanded that they should observe the month Abib, in which they celebrated the Passover, (<a href="3927/exodus_12_2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_16_1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1</a>).<p>States of truth are signified by "months," and in the opposite sense states of falsity with man, in Revelation above, (also chapters <a href="3927/revelation_9_5.htm">9:5</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_9_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_9_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_11_2.htm">11:2</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_13_5.htm">13:5</a>). The same is signified by month, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_47_12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 935 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>935. "Juxta mensem quemvis reddens fructum (suum)," significat quod Dominus producat bona apud hominem secundum omnem statum veri apud illum. - Per "mensem" significatur status vitae hominis quoad verum, de quo sequitur; per "reddere fructum" significatur producere bona; quod "fructus" sint bona amoris et charitatis, mox supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_935/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_934" target=_top>934</a>) ostensum est; et quia Dominus producit illa apud hominem essentialiter, tametsi homo facit illa sicut a se, ita apparenter (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_935/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_934" target=_top>934</a>, dictum est), constat quod significetur quod Dominus ex intimo, dum ibi est, producat illa. Sed dicetur quomodo intelligendum est quod Dominus producat bona charitatis apud hominem secundum statum veri apud illum: qui credit quod homo bonum faciat acceptum Domino, quod vocatur bonum spirituale, nisi apud illum sint vera ex Verbo, multum fallitur; bona absque veris non sunt bona, et Vera absque bonis non sunt vera apud hominem, tametsi in se sunt vera bonum enim absque vero est sicut voluntarium hoc minis absque intellectu, quod voluntarium non, est humanum, sed est sicut bestiae, vel sicut sculptilis quod artifex facit operari; at voluntarium una cum intellectuali fit humanum secundum statum intellectus per quem existit: nam status vitae cujusvis hominis talis est, quod voluntas ejus non possit aliquid facere nisi per intellectum, nec intellectus aliquid cogitare nisi ex voluntate; simile est cum bono et vero, quoniam bonum est voluntatis et verum est intellectus. Ex, his patet, quod bonum quod Dominus producit apud hominem sit secundum statum veri, ex quo est intellectus, apud illum.
