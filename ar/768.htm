<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第768节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>768.此处有必要说一下主对彼得所说关于“天国的钥匙”和“捆绑和释放的权柄”的真理（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.15.htm">16:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.20.htm">20</a>）。他们声称，这权柄被赐给彼得，又赐给作为其继任者的他们，因此主将其一切权柄留给彼得，在彼得之后又留给他们，教皇作为主的代理人在地上行事。然而，从主的这几句话很明显地看出来，祂根本没有将任何权柄赐给彼得，因为主说“我要把我的教会建造在这磐石上”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.18.htm">16:18</a>）。“磐石”表示主的神性真理，而作为“磐石”神性真理就是在主说这番话之前彼得所表白的。表白如下：</p><p>耶稣对门徒说，你们说我是谁，西门彼得回答说，你是基督，永生神的儿子。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.15.htm">16:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.16.htm">16</a>）</p><p>这就是主建立教会于其上的真理，而那时的彼得就代表该真理。由此明显可知，主将其教会建立对祂的承认上，即承认祂是永生神的儿子，拥有天上地上所有的权柄（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">28:18</a>），因而建立在祂自己身上，而不是彼得身上。在教会，众所周知，“磐石”表示主。</p><p>有一次，我在灵界与巴比伦一族谈论赐给彼得的钥匙，问他们是否相信天上地上的权柄从主转到彼得那里。由于这是他们宗教的来源，所以他们强烈坚持这一点，声称这是不容质疑的，经上说得很明显。但对于他们是否知道圣言的细节里面有一个灵义，也就是圣言在天上的意义这个问题，他们先是说不知道，但后来又说他们要调查一下。他们在调查时，被教导说，圣言的细节里面有一个灵义，这灵义不同于字义，犹如属灵之物不同于属世之物。此外，他们被教导说，圣言中的人名到了天上就不再是人名了，取而代之的是天使所理解的某种属灵之物。最后，他们被告知，天使将圣言中的“彼得”理解为教会源自良善的真理，而不是“彼得”，对与“彼得”一同提及的“磐石”的理解也一样。由此可知，彼得根本没有被赐予任何权柄，权柄只属于源自良善的真理，因为天上的一切权柄皆属于源自良善的真理，或属于藉着真理的良善。由于一切良善和真理皆源于主，丝毫不源于人，故主拥有一切权柄。一听到这些话，他们愤怒地说，他们想知道这些话里面有没有灵义。于是，天上的圣言被赐予他们，天上的圣言里面没有属世之义，只有属灵之义，因为天上的圣言适合属灵的天使。他们阅读此圣言时，清楚看到那里根本没有提及彼得，取而代之的是 “来自主源于良善的真理”。看到这一切，他们怒气冲冲地拒绝这圣言。若不及时拿走它，恐怕他们会将它撕成碎片。结果，他们尽管不愿意，还是信服唯独主拥有这权柄，而根本不是任何人，因为这是神性的权柄。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 768</h4><p>768. We will say something here about the truth that the Lord spoke to Peter regarding the keys of the kingdom of heaven and the power of binding and loosing (<a href="3927/matthew_16_15.htm">Matthew 16:15-20</a>).<p>Roman Catholics say that Peter was given this power, that it has been handed down to the Popes as Peter's successors, that the Lord thus left all His power to Peter and those after him, and that the Pope acts as His vicar on earth. But it is nevertheless clearly apparent from the Lord's own words that He gave not a bit of power to Peter, since the Lord says, "On this rock I will build My church."<p>The rock symbolizes the Lord in respect to His Divine truth, and the Divine truth or rock there is the one Peter confessed before the Lord spoke those words. This is what Peter confessed:<p>(The Lord said to His disciples,) "But who do you say that I am?" Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." (<a href="3927/matthew_16_15.htm">Matthew 16:15-16</a>)<p>This is the truth on which the Lord builds His church, and Peter then represented that truth. And it is apparent from this that it is a confession of the Lord as being the Son of the living God which has power over heaven and earth (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>), on which the Lord builds His church - thus upon Himself and not on Peter.<p>That the Lord is meant by Peter is something known in the church.</p><p>[2] I once spoke with the Babylonian tribe in the spiritual world about the keys given to Peter, asking whether they believe that the Lord transferred His power over heaven and earth to Peter.<p>Because this was the chief tenet of their religion, they vehemently insisted that He did, saying that there was no doubt about it, as it was clearly stated.<p>But on my asking whether they know that in every part of the Word there is a spiritual meaning, which is the meaning of the Word in heaven, they said at first that they were unaware of it. However, later they said that they would inquire into it; and when they did, they were told that there is a spiritual meaning in every part of the Word, which is as different from the literal sense as anything spiritual is from something natural. Moreover, they were also told that no person named in the Word is so named in heaven, but that instead angels understand in it something spiritual.<p>Finally they were informed that instead of Peter in the Word, angels understand the truth of the church springing from goodness, which is likewise meant by the rock that is mentioned there together with Peter; and that they could know therefore that Peter was not given any power, but that it belonged to truth springing from goodness. For all power in heaven is the power of truth springing from goodness, or of goodness by means of truth. And because all goodness and all truth come from the Lord, and nothing from any man, they could know that all power is the Lord's.<p>When they heard this, the Babylonian tribe angrily said that they wanted to know whether that is the spiritual meaning in these words. Therefore they were given the Word that is found in heaven, which contains not the natural sense but a spiritual one, because it exists for angels, who are spiritual. And when they read that Word, they clearly saw that Peter was not mentioned there, but instead truth springing from goodness from the Lord.<p>Having seen this, they angrily threw it away. They would almost have torn it to pieces with their teeth, except that at that moment it was taken away.<p>Thus they were convinced, even though they did not want to be convinced, that the Lord alone has all power, and less so any man because the power is Divine. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="../lj/57.htm">The Last Judgment 57</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 768</h4><p>768. Something shall be said here concerning that truth which the Lord told Peter concerning 'the keys of the kingdom of the heavens' and 'the authority of binding and loosing' (<a href="3927/matthew_16_15.htm">Matthew 16:15-20</a>). They say that that authority was given to Peter and that it has been transferred to them as his successors, and that thus the Lord left to Peter, and after him to them, all His authority, and that [the pope] should act as His vicar on earth. But still it is quite plain from the very words of the Lord that He gave no authority at all to Peter, for the Lord says 'Upon this Rock will I build My Church.' By 'the Rock' is signified the Lord as to His Divine Truths, and the Divine Truths that is 'the Rock is there what Peter confessed before the Lord said those words. The statement is this:<p>Jesus said to the disciples, Whom do you declare Me to be? Simon Peter answering said, THOU ART THE CHRIST, THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD. <a href="3927/matthew_16_15.htm">Matthew 16:15-16</a>.<p>This is the truth upon which the Lord builds His Church, and Peter then was representing that truth. It is plain from this that it is the confession of the Lord, THAT HE IS THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD, Who has authority over heaven and earth (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>), upon which the Lord builds His Church, thus upon Himself and not upon Peter. That the Lord is understood by 'the Rock' is known in the Church.</p><p>[2] <sup>1</sup>On one occasion I spoke with the Babylonish clan in the spiritual world about the keys given to Peter, [asking] whether they believe in the transfer to him of that authority from the Lord over heaven and earth. Because this was the fountainhead (caput) of their religion they were vehemently insisting on it, saying that there is no doubt about it because it is manifestly said. But to the question whether they know that within the details of the Word there is a spiritual sense, which is the sense of the Word in heaven, they were saying first that they did not know, but afterwards they were saying that they were going to inquire. And when they were inquiring they were instructed that there is a spiritual sense in the details of the Word, which differs from the sense of the letter as what is spiritual from what is natural. Moreover they were instructed that no person named in the Word is named its heaven, but that in place of him something spiritual is there understood. Finally they were informed that instead of 'Peter' in the Word is understood the Church's truth derived from good, and in like manner [this is understood] by 'the Rock' which is then named together with 'Peter.' Also that thereby it can be known that it was not to Peter that any authority was given, but to truth derived from good, for all the authority in the heavens belongs to truth derived from good, or to good by means of truth. And because all good and truth are derived from the Lord and nothing from man, that the Lord has all the authority. Indignant at having heard these things they said that they wished to know whether that spiritual sense is in those words. The Word that is in heaven was therefore given to them, in which Word there is not the natural but the spiritual sense because it is for angels who are spiritual. And when they were reading it they saw clearly that Peter is not there named, but in place of him TRUTH DERIVED FROM THE GOOD THAT IS FROM THE LORD. Having seen this they wrathfully rejected that [Word]. They would almost have torn it in pieces with their teeth if it had not at that moment been taken away. As a result they were convinced, although they did not wish to be convinced, that the Only Lord has that authority and not in the least any man, because it is a Divine authority.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the Original Edition this section appears with quotation marks.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 768</h4><p>768. Something shall here be said concerning that truth which the Lord said to Peter respecting the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and respecting the authority to bind and loose, (<a href="3927/matthew_16_15.htm">Matthew 16:15-20</a>). They say that that authority was given to Peter, and that it has been transferred to them as his successors; and that the Lord thus left to Peter, and after him to them, all His authority; and that he should act as His vicar on earth. But still it is plainly manifest from the Lord's words themselves, that he did not give the least of authority to Peter; for the Lord says, "Upon this rock I will build My church." By a "rock" the Lord is signified as to His Divine truth; and the Divine truth which is the rock, is there what Peter confessed, before the Lord said those words; which is this:<p>Jesus said to the disciples, But who say ye that I am? Simon Peter answering said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God, (<a href="3927/matthew_16_15.htm">Matthew 16:15-16</a>).<p>This is the truth upon which the Lord builds His church, and Peter then represented that truth. From which it is manifest, that the confession of the Lord, that He is the Son of the living God, who has power over heaven and earth, (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>), is that upon which the Lord builds His church; and thus upon Himself, and not upon Peter. It is known in the church that the Lord is meant by a rock.</p><p>[2] I once spoke with the Babylonian nation, in the spiritual world, concerning the keys given to Peter, whether they believe that authority over heaven and hell was transferred by the Lord to him. Which, as it was the head of their religion, they vehemently insisted upon; saying that there was no doubt of it, because it is manifestly said. But to the inquiry, whether they knew that in everything in the Word there is a spiritual sense, which is the sense of the Word in heaven, they said at first that they did not know it; but afterwards they said they would inquire. And when they inquired, they were instructed that there is a spiritual sense in each thing of the Word, which differs from the sense of the letter as spiritual from natural; and they were further instructed that no person named in the Word is named in heaven, but that instead something spiritual is there understood. They were informed at length, that for "Peter" in the Word the truth of the church from good is meant, and the same by the rock, which is mentioned together with Peter; and that it may thereby be known, that not any authority was given to Peter, but to truth from good; for all authority in the heavens belongs to truth from good, or is of good by truth. And as all good and all truth are from the Lord, and nothing from man, that all authority belongs to the Lord. On hearing this, being indignant, they said that they wished to know whether there is that spiritual sense in those words. Whereupon the Word which is in heaven was given to them, in which Word there is not the natural sense, but the spiritual; because it is for the angels, who are spiritual. And when they read it, they saw manifestly that Peter was not mentioned there, but instead of him "Truth from good which is from the Lord." On seeing this, they rejected it from anger, and would almost have torn it in pieces with their teeth, unless at that moment it had been taken away from them. They were thence convinced, although they were not willing to be convinced, that to the Lord alone that authority belongs, and not in the least to any man, because it is a Divine authority. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 768 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>768. Aliquid dicetur hic de illo Vero quod Dominus dixit ad Petrum de Clavibus Regni Caelorum, et de potestate ligandi et solvendi, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_768/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_16_15-20" target=_top>Matthaeus 16:15-20</a>). Dicunt quod illa potestas data sit Petro, et quod translata in illos ut successores ejus; et quod sic Dominus reliquerit Petro et post illum illis omnem Suam potestatem, et quod (Petrus) ageret Vicarium Ipsius in terra. Sed usque ex ipsismet Domini verbis patet manifeste quod ne hilum potestatis dederit Petro, dicit enim Dominus, "Super hac Petra aedificabo Ecclesiam Meam;" per "Petram" significatur Dominus quoad Divinum. Ipsius Verum; et Divinum Verum, quod est Petra, ibi est quod Petrus confessus est antequam Dominus illa dixit, quod est hoc: <p>"Dixit Jesus discipulis, Vos vero quem Me dicitis esse; respondens Simon Petrus dixit, Tu es Christus Filius Dei viventis "((<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_768/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_16_1-28" target=_top>Matthaeus 16</a>:) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_768/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_16_15-16" target=_top>15-16</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>hoc Verum est super quo Dominus aedificat Ecclesiam Suam, et Petrus tunc repraesentabat illud Verum; ex quo patet, quod confessio Domini, quod sit Filius Dei Viventis, Cui potestas est super Caelum et Terram, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_768/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_28_18" target=_top>Matthaeus 28:18</a>), sit super qua Dominus aedificat Ecclesiam Suam, ita super Se et non super Petro. Quod Dominus intelligatur per "Petram" in Ecclesia notum est. <p>Quondam locutus sum cum Gente Babylonica in mundo spirituali de Clavibus Petro datis, num credant in illum Potestatem a Domino super Caelum et Infernum translatam esse; quod quia erat caput Religionis eorum, vehementer instabant, dicentes quod de eo nihil dubii sit, qua manifeste dicitur. <p>Sed ad interrogationem num sciant, quod singulis Verbi insit Sensus spiritualis, qui est sensus Verbi in Caelo; dicebant primum quod non sciant, sed postea dicebant quod inquisituri sint. <p>Et cum inquirebant, instructi sunt quod Sensus spiritualis sit in singulis Verbi, qui a Sensu literae differt ut spirituale a naturali; et insuper instructi sunt, quod non aliqua Persona nominata in Verbo nominetur in Caelo, sed quod loco ejus aliquod spirituale ibi intelligatur. <p>Informati denique sunt quod pro "Petro" in Verbo intelligatur Ecclesiae Verum ex Bono, similiter per "Petram," quae tum; nominatur una cum Petro; et quod per id sciri possit quod non Petro data sit aliqua potestas, sed quod Vero ex Bono; nam omnis potestas in Caelis est Vero ex Bono, seu Boni per Verum; et quia omne Bonum et omne Verum sunt ex Domino, et nihil ex homine, qua omnis potestas sit Domino. <p>His auditis indignati dixerunt quod velint scire num is Sensus spiritualis sit in illis verbis. <p>Quapropter datum est illis Verbum quod in Caelo, in quo Verbo non est Sensus naturalis sed spiritualis, quia pro Angelis qui sunt spirituales; et cum id legebant, manifeste videbant non ibi Petrum nominari, sed loco ejus, "Verum ex bono quod a Domino." <p>Hoc viso ex ira rejecerunt illud; paene dilaniassent dentibus, nisi eo momento ablatum fuisset. <p>Inde convicti sunt, tametsi non voluerunt convinci, quod Soli Domino illa potestas sit, et eo minus alicui homini, quia est potestas Divina.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;16 pro "18" </p>
