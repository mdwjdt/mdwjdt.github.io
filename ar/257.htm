<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第257节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>257.“用七印封严了”表完全向天使和世人隐藏。显然，“用印封严”表示隐藏；因此，“用七印封严了”表示完全隐藏，因为“七”表示全部（10节），因而表示完全。接着，下面这些话就说到，这一切完全向天使和世人隐藏：</p><p>在天上、地上、地下，没有人能展开、能阅读、能观看那书卷。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.3.htm">5:3</a>）</p><p>这就是圣言，羔羊，也就是主没有向任何人打开它。此处因论述最后审判前对所有人的审查，故所有人的生命状态完全隐藏起来，无论总体还是细节。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 257</h4><p>257. Sealed with seven seals. This symbolizes the Word completely hidden from angel and man.<p>It is apparent that to be sealed with a seal means, symbolically, to be hidden. Therefore to be sealed with seven seals means, symbolically, to be completely hidden, for seven symbolizes all (no. <a href="10.htm">10</a>), thus also completely. That the Word was completely hidden from angel and man is soon declared in the following words, "And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book and read it, or to look in it" (verses 3, 4). Such is the Word to all to whom the Lamb, or Lord, does not open it.<p>Because the subject here is the exploration of all people before the Last Judgment, it is the states of life of all in general and in particular that are completely hidden. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 257</h4><p>257. Sealed with seven seals' signifies this altogether hidden away from angel and man. That 'sealed with a seal' signifies what is hidden away is plain. Consequently 'sealed with seven seals' signifies what is altogether hidden away, for 'seven' signifies all (<a href="10.htm">10</a>), thus also altogether. That it is altogether hidden away from angel and man is said soon afterwards in these words:<p>And no one in heaven, nor upon the land, nor yet under the land, was able to open and to read the book, nor to look into it (verses 3-4).<p>Such is the Word to all to whom the Lamb, that is, the Lord does not open it. Here, because it treats of the examination of all before the last judgment, the states of life of all in general and particular, which are altogether hidden away, are referred to. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 257</h4><p>257. Sealed with seven seals, signifies that it is altogether hidden from angel and man. That "to be sealed with a seal" signifies to be hidden is evident, hence "to be sealed with seven seals" signifies to be altogether hidden, for "seven" signifies all, (<a href="10.htm">10</a>), and therefore altogether; that it was altogether hidden from angel and man, is presently said in these words:<p>And no one in heaven, nor on earth, neither under the earth, was able to open and read the book, neither to look thereon, (<a href="3927/revelation_5_3.htm">Revelation 5:3</a>).<p>Such is the Word to all to whom the Lamb, that is, the Lord, does not open it. Here, because the exploration of all before the Last Judgment is treated of, it is the states of life of all in general and in particular, which are altogether hidden. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 257 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>257. "Obsignatum sigillis septem," significat illud prorsus absconditum angelo et homini. - Quod "obsignatum sigillo" significet absconditum, patet; inde "obsignatum septem sigillis" significat prorsus absconditum, "septem" enim significant omne (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_257/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_10" target=_top>10</a>), ita quoque prorsus; quod prorsus absconditum angelo et homini, dicitur mox his verbis: <p>"Et nemo potuit in Caelo, nec super terra, neque sub terra, aperire et legere librum, nec inspicere illum," (vers. 3, 4);<p>tale est Verbum omnibus, quibus Agnus, hoc est, Dominus non aperit illud: hic quia de exploratione omnium ante Ultimum Judicium agitur, sunt status vitae omnium in communi et particulari, qui prorsus absconditi sunt. </p>
