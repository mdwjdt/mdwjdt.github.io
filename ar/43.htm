<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第43节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>43.“既转过来，就看见七个金灯台”表将处于来自主出于圣言的启示中的新教会。“七个灯台”就是七个教会，这在本章最后一节有所说明；七个教会表示凡在基督教界和亲近教会的所有人（参看<a href="10.htm">10</a>节）；若加细分，则依照各自的接受状态（<a href="41.htm">41</a>节）。“七个灯台”之所以表示新教会，是因为主在它里面，就在它中间；因为经上说“他看见七灯台中间有一位好像人子”，“人子”表示圣言方面的主。灯台是被看到是金的，因为“金”表示良善，每个教会都是凭由真理所形成的良善而成为一个教会；“金”表示良善，这一点可见于下文。</p><p>这些灯台不是一个接一个紧挨着或连起来放的，而是隔了一定距离，围成了一个圈。这一点从随后章节的这些话明显看出来：</p><p>这些事是在七个金灯台中间行走的那位说的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.1.htm">2:1</a>）</p><p>经上未曾说灯台上有灯，而是在下文说：</p><p>圣耶路撒冷（就是新教会）不用日月光照，因有城的灯是羔羊，得救的列族要在城的光里行走。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.23.htm">21:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.24.htm">24</a>）</p><p>还有：</p><p>他们不用灯，因为主神给他们光。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.5.htm">22:5</a>）</p><p>因为将归入主的新教会之人只是灯台，而灯台要靠主来发光。</p><p>会幕中的金灯台无非代表从主得启示的教会（关于这灯台，可参看出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.31.htm">25:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.40.htm">40</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出37.17.htm">37:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出37.24.htm">24</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利24.3.htm">24:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利24.4.htm">4</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.2.htm">8:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.4.htm">4</a>）。它代表主教会的神性属灵之爱，也就是对邻之爱。这一点可见于出版于伦敦的《天堂的奥秘》（<a href="../ac/9548.htm">9548</a>，<a href="../ac/9555.htm">9555</a>，<a href="../ac/9558.htm">9558</a>，<a href="../ac/9561.htm">9561</a>，<a href="../ac/9570.htm">9570</a>，<a href="../ac/9783.htm">9783</a>节）一书，以及后文（<a href="493.htm">493</a>节）。撒迦利亚书第4章所说的“灯台”也表示主要建立的新教会，因为它表示神的新家，或新殿，这从那里的下文明显看出来。“神的家”或“神的殿”表示教会，在至高意义上表示主的神性人，如主自己所教导的（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.19.htm">2:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.21.htm">21</a>等）。不过，有必要说明，当撒迦利亚看见“灯台”时，它在撒迦利亚书第4章依次有何含义。</p><p>包含在第一节至第七节中的那些事物表示主的新教会出于爱之良善凭借真理的启示，其中“橄榄树”表示教会的爱之良善。包含在第八节至第十节中的事物表示这些事物来自主，其中将新建圣殿（也就是新建教会）的“所罗巴伯”代表主。包含在第十一节至第十四节中的事物表示该教会也将掌握来自属天源头的真理。这一章的解释是主通过天堂赐给我的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 43</h4><p>43. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands. This symbolizes a new church, which will have an enlightenment from the Lord from the Word.<p>We are told in the last verse of this chapter that the seven lampstands are the seven churches, and it may be seen in no. <a href="10.htm">10</a> above that the seven churches mean all in the Christian world who turn to the church - and this in every case according to each one's state of reception (no. <a href="41.htm">41</a>).<p>The seven lampstands mean a new church because the Lord is in it and in the midst of it. For we are told that in the midst of the seven lampstands John saw one like the Son of Man, and the Son of Man means the Lord in relation to the Word.<p>The lampstands appeared golden, because gold symbolizes goodness, and every church is a church by virtue of the goodness that is formed through truths. That gold symbolizes goodness will be seen in subsequent explanations.</p><p>[2] These lampstands were not next to one another or placed so as to touch each other, but stood at some intervals forming a kind of circle, as it apparent from this statement in the following chapter,<p>These things says He who... walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands. (<a href="3927/revelation_2_1.htm">Revelation 2:1</a>)<p>We are not told anything about the lamps on the lampstands, but later it is said that the Holy Jerusalem, which is to say, the New Church, "has no need of the sun or of the moon," because "its lamp is the Lamb, and the nations that are saved shall walk in its light" (<a href="3927/revelation_21_23.htm">Revelation 21:23-24</a>). And furthermore,<p>They need no lamp..., for the Lord God gives them light. (<a href="3927/revelation_22_5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>)<p>For those people who will be constituents of the Lord's New Church are the only "lampstands" that will shine with light from the Lord.</p><p>[3] The golden lampstand in the Tabernacle represented nothing else than the church in relation to its enlightenment by the Lord. Regarding this lampstand, see <a href="3927/exodus_25_31.htm">Exodus 25:31-40</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_37_17.htm">37:17-24</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_26_35.htm">26:35</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_8_2.htm">Numbers 8:2-4</a>. That it represented the Lord's church as to Divine spiritual love, which is love for the neighbor, see Arcana Coelestia (The Secrets of Heaven), nos. <a href="../ac/9548.htm">9548</a>, <a href="../ac/9555.htm">9555</a>, <a href="../ac/9558.htm">9558</a>, <a href="../ac/9561.htm">9561</a>, <a href="../ac/9570.htm">9570</a>, <a href="../ac/9783.htm">9783</a>. See also no. <a href="493.htm">493</a> below.<p>The lampstand in <a href="3927/zechariah_4_1.htm">Zechariah 4</a> also symbolizes a new church to be established by the Lord, since it symbolizes a new house of God or temple, as is apparent from what follows there; and a house of God or temple symbolizes the church, and in the highest sense, the Lord's Divine humanity, as He Himself teaches in <a href="3927/john_2_19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>, <sup>1</sup>and elsewhere.<p>But we will say what in turn is symbolically meant in <a href="3927/zechariah_4_1.htm">Zechariah 4</a>, when the lampstand appeared to him:<p>The particulars contained in verses <a href="3927/revelation_1_1.htm">1-7</a> symbolize the Lord's enlightenment of a new church from the goodness of love by means of truth. The olive trees there symbolize the church in regard to the goodness of love.<p>The particulars from <a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">8-10</a> verse there mean, symbolically, that the enlightenment comes from the Lord. Zerubbabel there, who is to build the house, thus the church, represents the Lord.<p>The particulars from verse <a href="3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11-14</a> mean, symbolically, that that the church will also have in it truths from a heavenly origin.<p>This explanation of that chapter was given to me by the Lord through heaven.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." Then the Jews said, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?" But He was speaking of the temple of His body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 43</h4><p>43. 'And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands' signifies the New Church, which will be in enlightenment from the Lord out of the Word. That the 'seven lampstands' are the seven Churches is stated in the last verse of this chapter; and that by 'the seven Churches' are understood all who are in Christendom and who accede to the Church may be seen above (<a href="10.htm">10</a>); and specifically in accordance with the state of reception of each one (<a href="41.htm">41</a>). The New Church is understood by the 'seven lampstands' because the Lord is in it, and in the midst of it; for it is said that in the midst of the seven lampstands he saw One like unto the SON OF MAN, and by the 'Son of Man' is understood the Lord as to the Word. The lampstands were seen 'golden' because gold signifies good, and every Church is a Church by virtue of the good that is formed by means of truths. That 'gold' signifies good will be seen in the following [pages].</p><p>[2] The lampstands were not placed close to one another, or in contact, but standing apart making a kind of ring, as is plain from these words in the following chapter:<p>These things says He Who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands. <a href="3927/revelation_2_1.htm">Revelation 2:1</a>.<p>Nothing is said about the lamps of these lampstands, but in the things following it is said that: the holy Jerusalem (that is, the New Church) has no need of the sun, neither of the moon, for the Lamp thereof is the Lamb, and the nations that are being saved shall walk in His Light. <a href="3927/revelation_21_23.htm">Revelation 21:23-24</a>; and further:<p>They need no lamp, for the Lord God enlightens them. <a href="3927/revelation_22_5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>.<p>In fact those who will be of the Lord's New Church (erunt e Nova Ecclesia Domini) are only lampstands that will shine from the Lord.</p><p>[3] By the 'golden lampstand' in the tabernacle nothing else was represented than the Church as to enlightenment from the Lord, concerning which lampstand see, <a href="3927/exodus_25_31.htm">Exodus 25:31-40</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_37_17.htm">37:17-24</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_24_3.htm">Leviticus 24:3-4</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_8_2.htm">Numbers 8:2-4</a>. That it represented the Lord's Church as to spiritual Divine love, which is love towards the neighbour, may be seen in ARCANA CAELESTIA published at London (<a href="../ac/9548.htm">9548</a>, <a href="../ac/9555.htm">9555</a>, <a href="../ac/9558.htm">9558</a>, <a href="../ac/9561.htm">9561</a>, <a href="../ac/9570.htm">9570</a>, <a href="../ac/9783.htm">9783</a>); also below (<a href="493.htm">493</a>). In <a href="3927/zechariah_4_1.htm">Zechariah 4</a>, by the 'lampstand' is signified the New Church about to be set up by the Lord, since it signifies the new house of God or the new temple as is plain from the things following there, and by 'the house of God' or 'the temple' is signified the Church, and in the supreme sense the Lord's Divine Human, as He Himself teaches (<a href="3927/john_2_19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>, and elsewhere). It will, however, be stated what is signified in order in chapter <a href="3927/zechariah_4_1.htm">4</a> in the case of Zechariah when the 'lampstand' was seen by him.</p><p>[4] 'By the things that are contained from verses 1-7 is signified the enlightenment of the New Church by the Lord out of the good of love by means of truth. The olive trees there signify the Church as to the good of love. By the things from verses 8-10 there is signified that these things are from the Lord. The Lord is represented by Zerubbabel there, who is going to build the house, thus the Church. By the things from verses 11-14 is signified that in that Church there will also be truths out of a heavenly source. The exposition of that chapter has been given to me by the Lord through heaven.' </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 43</h4><p>43. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands, signifies the New Church, which will be in enlightenment from the Lord out of the Word. That the "seven lampstands" are the seven churches, is said in the last verse of this chapter; and that by the seven churches are meant all who are in the Christian world, and draw near to the church, may be seen above, (<a href="10.htm">10</a>); and in particular according to the state of reception of each, (<a href="41.htm">41</a>). The reason why the New Church is meant by "the seven lampstands" is, because in it, and in the midst of it, the Lord is; for it is said, that "in the midst of the seven lampstands he saw one like unto the Son of man," and by "the Son of man" is meant the Lord as to the Word. The lampstands were seen to be golden, because gold signifies good, and every church is a church from good which is formed by truths; that "gold" signifies good, will be seen in what follows.</p><p>[2] Those lampstands were not placed one close to another, or in contact, but at certain distances, forming a kind of circle, as is evident from these words in the subsequent chapter:<p>These things saith He, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden lampstands, (<a href="3927/revelation_2_1.htm">Revelation 2:1</a>).<p>Nothing is said of the lamps of those lampstands; but in what follows it is said, that:<p>The Holy Jerusalem (that is, the New Church), hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, for its lamp is the Lamb, and the nations which are saved shall walk in the light of it, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_23.htm">Revelation 21:23-24</a>).<p>And further:<p>They need no lamp, for the Lord God giveth them light, (<a href="3927/revelation_22_5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>);<p>for they who will be of the Lord's New Church, are only lampstands which will give light from the Lord.</p><p>[3] By the "golden lampstand in the tabernacle," nothing else was represented than the church as to enlightenment from the Lord, concerning which lampstand see, (<a href="3927/exodus_25_31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_37_17.htm">37:17-24</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_24_3.htm">Leviticus 24:3-4</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_8_2.htm">Numbers 8:2-4</a>). That it represented the Lord's church as to Divine spiritual love, which is love towards the neighbor, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, published at London, (<a href="../ac/9548.htm">9548</a>, <a href="../ac/9555.htm">9555</a>, <a href="../ac/9558.htm">9558</a>, <a href="../ac/9561.htm">9561</a>, <a href="../ac/9570.htm">9570</a>, <a href="../ac/9783.htm">9783</a>); also, below, (<a href="493.htm">493</a>). By the "lampstand" in Zechariah 4 is also signified the New Church to be established by the Lord, because it signifies the new house of God, or the new temple; as is evident from what follows there; and by "the house of God," or "the temple," the church is signified, and in the highest sense, the Lord's Divine Human, as He Himself teaches, (<a href="3927/john_2_19.htm">John 2:19-21</a> elsewhere). But it shall be told what is signified in its order, in Zech. (chap. 4), when "the lampstand" was seen by him.</p><p>[4] By those things contained from verses 1-7, is signified the enlightenment of the New Church by the Lord, from the good of love by truth, "the olive trees" there signify the church as to the good of love; by the things there from verse 8-10, is signified that these things are from the Lord; by "Zerubbabel," who is to build the house, thus the church, the Lord is represented; by the things from verse 11-14, is signified that in that church there will also be truths from a celestial origin. This explanation of that chapter was given me by the Lord through heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 43 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>43. "Et conversus vidi Septem Candelabra aurea," significat Novam Ecclesiam, quae in illustratione a Domino ex Verbo erit. - Quod "Septem Candelabra" sint Septem Ecclesiae, dicitur in versu ultimo hujus capitis; et quod per Septem Ecclesias intelligantur omnes qui in Christiano Orbe sunt, et accedunt ad Ecclesiam, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_43/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_10" target=_top>10</a>); et in specie secundum statum receptionis cujusvis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_43/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_41" target=_top>41</a>).

Candelabra illa visa sunt aurea, quia aurum significat bonum, et omnis Ecclesia est Ecclesia ex bono quod formatur per vera; quod "aurum" significet bonum, videbitur in sequentibus. Candelabra illa non erant unum juxta alterum, seu ad contactum posita, sed ad distantias facientia quendam circum, ut patet ab his in sequente capite: <p>"Haec dixit, Qui ambulat in medio Septem Candelabrorum aureorum, (vers. 1).<p>Non dicitur aliquid de lucernis Candelabrorum istorum, sed in sequentibus dicitur quod Sancta Hierosolyma (hoc est, Nova Ecclesia) "non opus habeat Sole, nec Luna, quia Lucerna ejus Agnus, et gentes quae salvantur, in Luce Ipsius ambulabunt," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_43/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_23-24" target=_top>Apocalypsis 21:23-24</a>);<p>et porro, <p>"Non opus habent Lucerna, quia Dominus Deus illustrat illos," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_43/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_22_5" target=_top>22:5</a>);<p>sunt enim illi, qui e Nova Ecclesia Domini erunt, solum Candelabra, qui lucebunt a Domino.
