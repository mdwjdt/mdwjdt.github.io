<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 387</h4><p>387. CHAPTER 8<p>1. When He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.<p>2. And I saw the seven angels who stood before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.<p>3. Then another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and he was given much incense, that he should offer it for the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.<p>4. And the smoke of the incense for the prayers of the saints ascended before God from the angel's hand.<p>5. Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it to the earth. And there were voices, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake.<p>6. And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.<p>7. The first angel sounded: And hail and fire followed, mingled with blood, and they were cast down to the earth, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.<p>8. Then the second angel sounded: And something like a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood.<p>9. And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.<p>10. Then the third angel sounded: And a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.<p>11. The name of the star is Wormwood, and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the water, because it was made bitter.<p>12. Then the fourth angel sounded: And a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, and a third of them was darkened, so that a third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night.<p>13. And I looked, and I heard an angel flying in the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!"<p>THE SPIRITUAL MEANING<p>The Contents of the Whole Chapter<p>This chapter has as its subject the church of the Protestant Reformed and what the people are like in it who are caught up in faith alone. It describes the preparation of the spiritual heaven for communication with them (verses 1-6); the examination and disclosure of those there who are immersed in the interior elements of that faith (verse 7), and of those who are immersed in its exterior elements (verses 8, 9); and what they are like as regards their understanding of the Word (verses 10, 11), showing that they are caught up in falsities and their accompanying evils (verses 12, 13).<p>The Contents of the Individual Verses:<p></p><table><thead><tr><th>Verse Contents</th><th>Spiritual Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. When He opened the seventh seal,</td><td>An examination by the Lord of the state of the church and consequent life of people who are in His spiritual kingdom - people who are governed by charity and its accompanying faith - here people caught up in faith alone.</td></tr><tr><td>there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.</td><td>Angels from the Lord's spiritual kingdom were quite dumbfounded when they saw people who claimed to have faith to be in the state they were.</td></tr><tr><td>2. And I saw the seven angels who stood before God,</td><td>The entire spiritual heaven in the Lord's presence, hearing and doing whatever He commanded.</td></tr><tr><td>and to them were given seven trumpets.</td><td>An examination and exposure of the state of the church and consequent life of people caught up in faith alone.</td></tr><tr><td>3. Then another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer,</td><td>Spiritual worship, which originates from the goodness of charity expressed through truths of faith.</td></tr><tr><td>and he was given much incense, that he should offer it for the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</td><td>A propitiation, lest angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom be harmed by the spirits of the satanic kingdom situated below.</td></tr><tr><td>4. And the smoke of the incense for the prayers of the saints ascended before God from the angel's hand.</td><td>Their protection by the Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>5. Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it to the earth.</td><td>Spiritual love, containing celestial love, and its influx into the lower regions where those people were who were caught up in a faith divorced from charity.</td></tr><tr><td>And there were voices, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake.</td><td>After a communication with them was opened, the angels heard reasonings about faith alone and arguments in support of it.</td></tr><tr><td>6. And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</td><td>Their being prepared and ready to examine the state of the church and consequent life in people for whom religion is faith alone.</td></tr><tr><td>7. The first angel sounded:</td><td>An examination and disclosure of the state of life and its character in people caught up interiorly in that faith.</td></tr><tr><td>And hail and fire followed, mingled with blood,</td><td>Falsity springing from a hellish love, destroying goodness and truth and falsifying the Word.</td></tr><tr><td>and they were cast down to the earth, and a third of the trees were burned up,</td><td>In such people all affection for truth and perception of truth, which make a person a person of the church, had perished,</td></tr><tr><td>and all green grass was burned up.</td><td>and thus every constituent of faith having life.</td></tr><tr><td>8. Then the second angel sounded:</td><td>An examination and disclosure of the state of the church and its character in people caught up externally in that faith.</td></tr><tr><td>And something like a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea,</td><td>The appearance of a hellish love in them.</td></tr><tr><td>and a third of the sea became blood.</td><td>General truths had all been falsified in them.</td></tr><tr><td>9. And a third of the living creatures in the sea died,</td><td>Those who had lived that faith and continued to live it could not be reformed and receive life.</td></tr><tr><td>and a third of the ships were destroyed.</td><td>Concepts of goodness and truth from the Word that are serviceable for application to life, in them had all been destroyed.</td></tr><tr><td>10. Then the third angel sounded:</td><td>An examination and disclosure of the state of the church in people for whom religion is faith alone as regards their affection for truths from the Word and reception of them.</td></tr><tr><td>And a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch,</td><td>The appearance of their personal intelligence owing to a conceit arising from a hellish love.</td></tr><tr><td>and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.</td><td>Consequently all the Word's truths had been completely falsified.</td></tr><tr><td>11. The name of the star is Wormwood, and a third of the waters became wormwood,</td><td>Hellish falsity, the origin of their personal intelligence, by which they had falsified all the Word's truths.</td></tr><tr><td>and many people died from the water, because it was made bitter.</td><td>The extinction of spiritual life because of the falsification of the Word's truths.</td></tr><tr><td>12. Then the fourth angel sounded:</td><td>An examination and disclosure of the state of the church in people for whom religion is faith alone, that they are caught up in the evils accompanying falsity and in the falsities accompanying evil.</td></tr><tr><td>And a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, and a third of them was darkened,</td><td>Because of their evils springing from falsities and their falsities springing from evils, they did not know what love is, or what faith is, or any truth.</td></tr><tr><td>so that a third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night.</td><td>They no longer have in them any spiritual truth or natural truth from the Word serviceable for doctrine and life.</td></tr><tr><td>13. And I looked, and I heard an angel flying in the midst of heaven,</td><td>Instruction and prediction from the Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!"</td><td>The utmost lamentation over the state of damnation of people in the church who in doctrine and life have confirmed themselves in a faith divorced from charity.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>THE EXPOSITION<p>The whole of heaven has been divided into two kingdoms - the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom. The celestial kingdom consists of people who are governed by love toward the Lord and its accompanying wisdom; and the spiritual kingdom consists of people who are governed by love for the neighbor and its accompanying intelligence. But because love for the neighbor is today called charity, and intelligence faith, this latter kingdom consists of people who are governed by charity and its accompanying faith.<p>Now because heaven has been divided into two kingdoms, hell also has been divided into two kingdoms opposite to these - the diabolical kingdom and the satanic kingdom. The diabolical kingdom consists of people who are governed by a love of ruling stemming from a love of self and by its accompanying foolishness, for that love is the opposite of celestial love, and its foolishness is the opposite of celestial wisdom. The satanic kingdom, on the other hand, consists of people who are governed by a love of ruling from a conceit in their own intelligence and by its accompanying irrationality, for that love is the opposite of spiritual love, and its irrationality is the opposite of spiritual intelligence.<p>By foolishness and irrationality we mean foolishness and irrationality in celestial and spiritual matters.<p>What we have said about heaven is to be understood to apply likewise to the church on earth, for the two are inseparable.<p>Regarding these two kingdoms, see the book, Heaven and Hell, published in London, nos. <a href="../hh/20.htm">20-28</a> and many other numbers elsewhere.</p><p>[2] Now because the book of Revelation has as its sole subject the state of the church at its end, as we said in the Preface and in no. 2, therefore from this point on it deals with the inhabitants of the two kingdoms of heaven and the inhabitants of the two kingdoms of hell, and their character: with the inhabitants of the spiritual kingdom and of the satanic kingdom opposite to that kingdom, from chapter eight here to chapter sixteen, and with the inhabitants of the celestial kingdom and of the diabolical kingdom opposite to it in chapters seventeen and eighteen. After that it describes the Last Judgment, and finally the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem. This concludes everything that precedes, because it is to this end that they looked.<p>Here and there in the Word we find mention of the devil and Satan, and both mean hell. Each is mentioned because all the inhabitants in one hell are called devils, and all in the other hell, satanic spirits. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 387</h4><p>387. THE EIGHTH CHAPTER<p>1. AND when He opened the seventh seal, it became silent in heaven for what seemed half an hour.<p>2. And I saw the seven angels who stood before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.<p>3. And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and there were given unto him many incense-offerings for him to offer with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.<p>4. And the smoke of the incense-offerings with the prayers of the saints went up from the angel's hand before God.<p>5. And the angel took the censer, and filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the land, and voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake were produced.<p>6. And the seven angels having the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.<p>7. And the first angel sounded, and hail and fire mingled with blood was produced and hurled upon the land, and a third part of the trees was burnt, and all the green grass was burnt.<p>8. And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea, and a third part of the sea became blood.<p>9. And a third part of the creatures in the sea having souls died, and a third part of the ships was destroyed.<p>10. And the third angel sounded, and there fell out of heaven a great star burning as if it were a torch, and it fell upon a third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters.<p>11. And the name of the star is termed Wormwood; and a third part of the waters became wormwood, and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter.<p>12. And the fourth angel sounded, and a third part of the sun was smitten, and a third part of the moon, and a third part of the stars, and a third part of them was darkened, so that the day should not shine for a third part of it, and the night likewise.<p>13. And I saw and heard one angel flying in the midst of heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe to those dwelling upon the land, by reason of the remaining voices of the trumpet of the three angels that are yet to sound.<p>THE SPIRITUAL SENSE<p>THE CONTENTS OF THE WHOLE CHAPTER<p>It treats here of the Church of the Reformed, of what quality they are there who are in faith alone: the preparation of the spiritual heaven for communication with them (verses 1-6). An examination and making manifest [to show the State] of those there who are in the interiors of that faith (verse 7); of those who are in the exteriors thereof (verses 8-9). What they are as to the understanding of the Word (verses 10-11). That they are in untruths and consequently in evils (verses 12-13).<p>THE CONTENTS OF EACH OF THE VERSES<p>1. And [when] He opened the seventh seal, signifies examination by the Lord of the state of the Church and consequently of the state of life of those who are in His spiritual kingdom, being those who are in charity and the faith thereof, here those who are in faith alone.<p>It became silent in heaven for what seemed half an hour, signifies that the angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom were exceedingly astonished when they saw those who had declared themselves to be in faith in such a state.<p>2. And I saw the seven angels who stood before God, signifies the entire spiritual heaven in the presence of the Lord, hearing and doing the things He commands.<p>And seven trumpets were given to them, signifies the examination and disclosure of the state of the Church, and consequently of the life of those who are in faith alone.<p>3. And another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer, signifies spiritual worship which is produced out of the good of charity by means of truths of faith.<p>And there were given unto him many incense-offerings for him to offer with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar that is before the throne, signifies propitiation lest the angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom should be hurt by the spirits of the satanic kingdom who were below.<p>4. And the smoke of the incense-offerings with the prayers of the saints went up from the angel's hand before God, signifies the safeguarding of those [angels] by the Lord.<p>5. And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the land, signifies spiritual love in which there is celestial love, and its influx into the lower regions where were those who are in faith separated from charity<p>And voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake were produced, signifies that after communication was opened with them they were heard reasoning about faith alone and confirmations in favour of it [, and that the state of the Church with them was perceived to be tottering to destruction].<p>6. And the seven angels having the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound, signifies [the spiritual angels] prepared and equipped for examining the state of the Church and consequently of the life with those for whom religion is faith alone.<p>7. And the first angel sounded, signifies an examination and making manifest [to show] what the state of the Church is with those who are interiorly in that faith.<p>And hail and fire mingled with blood was produced, signifies untruth derived from infernal love destroying good and truth, and falsifying the Word.<p>And hurled upon the land, and a third part of the trees was burnt, signifies that with those every affection and perception of truth that make the man of the Church had perished.<p>And all the green grass was burnt, signifies thus every living thing of faith.<p>8. And the second angel sounded, signifies an examination and making manifest [to show] what the state of the Church is with those who are exteriorly in that faith.<p>And as it were a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea, signifies the appearance of infernal love with those.<p>And a third part of the sea became blood, signifies that all the general truths with them had been falsified.<p>9. And a third part of the creatures in the sea having souls died, signifies that those who have lived and are living that faith cannot be reformed and accept life.<p>And a third part of the ships was destroyed, signifies that all the cognitions of good and truth serviceable for use of life had been utterly lost with them.<p>10. And the third angel sounded, signifies an examination and making manifest [to show] the state of the Church with those for whom religion is faith alone, in regard to the affection and reception of the truths (veritas) out of the Word.<p>And there fell out of heaven a great star burning as if it were a torch, signifies the appearance of their self-intelligence derived from pride arising from infernal love.<p>And it fell upon a third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters, signifies that as a result of this all the truths of the Word have been altogether falsified.<p>11. And the name of the star is termed Wormwood, and a third part of the waters became wormwood, signifies the infernal untruth from which their self-intelligence is derived, by means of which all the truths of the Word have been falsified.<p>And many men died of the waters because they were made bitter, signifies the extinction of spiritual life [with many] as a result of the truths of the Word having been falsified.<p>12. And the fourth angel sounded, signifies an examination and making manifest [to show] the state of the Church with those for whom religion is faith alone, that they are in evils of untruth and untruths of evil.<p>And a third part of the sun was smitten and a third part of the moon, and a third part of the stars, and a third part of them was darkened, signifies that by reason of the evils derived from untruths and the untruths derived from evils, they did not know what love is, what faith is, nor anything true.<p>So that the day should not shine for a third part of it, and the night likewise, signifies no longer any spiritual truth nor natural truth serviceable for doctrine and life out of the Word with them.<p>13. And I saw and heard one angel flying in the midst of heaven, signifies instruction and prediction by the Lord.<p>Saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe to those dwelling upon the land by reason of the remaining voices of the trumpet of the three angels that are yet to sound, signifies the utmost lamentation over the damned state of those in the Church who, in doctrine and life, have confirmed with themselves faith separated from charity.<p>THE EXPOSITION<p>There are two kingdoms into which the entire heaven is distinguished, a CELESTIAL KINGDOM and a SPIRITUAL KINGDOM. The celestial kingdom consists of those who are in love directed to the Lord and consequently in wisdom; while the spiritual kingdom consists of those who are in love towards the neighbour and consequently in intelligence; and because love towards the neighbour is at this day called charity, and intelligence is called faith, the latter kingdom consists of those who are in charity and consequently in faith. Now because heaven is distinguished into two kingdoms, hell also is distinguished into two kingdoms opposed to them; into a DIABOLICAL KINGDOM and a SATANIC KINGDOM. The diabolical kingdom consists of those who are in a love of domineering derived from the love of self, and consequently are in folly, for that love is opposed to celestial love, while the folly thereof is opposed to celestial wisdom. The satanic kingdom, however, consists of those who are in a love of domineering derived from self-intelligence, and consequently are in insanity, for that love is opposed to spiritual love, while the insanity thereof is opposed to spiritual intelligence. By 'folly' and 'insanity' is understood a folly and insanity in things celestial and spiritual. Similar things are to be understood of the Church on earth, as have been said of heaven, for they make one. Concerning these two kingdoms the work on HEAVEN AND HELL, published at London, may be seen (<a href="20.htm">20-28</a>, and many other places).</p><p>[2] Now because, as was said in the Preface and in <a href="2.htm">2</a>, the Apocalypse treats solely of the state of the Church at its end, from now on for that reason it treats of those in the two kingdoms of heaven, and of those in the two kingdoms of hell, and of their quality. From this chapter <a href="3927/revelation_8_1.htm">8</a> to chapter <a href="3927/revelation_16_1.htm">16</a> it treats of those who are in the spiritual kingdom, and in the satanic kingdom opposed to it; and in chapters <a href="3927/revelation_17_1.htm">17</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_18_1.htm">18</a> of those who are in the celestial kingdom, and in the diabolical kingdom opposed to it; and afterwards of the last judgment, and finally of the New Church that is the New Jerusalem, this bringing all that goes before to a conclusion because it is the end for the sake of which [all the examining and judgment is undergone]. In various places in the Word there is mention of the Devil and Satan, and by both of them hell is understood. It is so named because all in the one hell are called devils, and all in the other are called satans. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 387</h4><p>387. Revelation 8<p>1. And when He had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven as of half an hour.<p>2. And I saw the seven angels, who stood before God; and there were given to them seven trumpets.<p>3. And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.<p>4. And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the angel before God.<p>5. And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it unto the earth: and there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake.<p>6. And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.<p>7. And the first angel sounded, and there became hail and fire, mingled with blood; and they were cast upon the earth; and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.<p>8. And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and the third part of the sea became blood.<p>9. And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea that had souls died; and the third part of the ships perished.<p>10. And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters.<p>11. And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.<p>12. And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so that the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.<p>13. And I saw, and I heard an angel flying in the midst of heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, to them that dwell on the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels that are about to sound.<p>THE SPIRITUAL SENSE<p>The contents of the whole chapter<p>The church of the Reformed is here treated of, as to the quality of those therein who are in faith alone: the preparation of the spiritual heaven for communication with them (verses <a href="3927/revelation_8_1.htm">1-6</a>). The exploration and manifestation of those therein, who are in the interiors of that faith (verse <a href="3927/revelation_8_7.htm">7</a>). Of those who are in its exteriors (verses <a href="3927/revelation_8_8.htm">8-9</a>). What they are as to the understanding of the Word (verses <a href="3927/revelation_8_10.htm">10-11</a>). That they are in falsities and thence in evils (verses <a href="3927/revelation_8_12.htm">12-13</a>).<p>The contents of each verse<p>Verse 1. "And when He had opened the seventh seal," signifies exploration by the Lord of the state of the church, and thence of the life of those who are in His spiritual kingdom, being those who are in charity and its faith, in this case who are in faith alone, (<a href="388.htm">388</a>). "There was silence in heaven as of half an hour," signifies that the angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom were greatly amazed when they saw those who said they were in the faith in such a state, (<a href="389.htm">389</a>).<p>Verse 2. "And I saw the seven angels who stood before God," signifies the entire spiritual heaven in the presence of the Lord, hearing and doing what He commands, (<a href="390.htm">390</a>). "And there were given to them seven trumpets," signifies the exploration and disclosure of the state of the church, and thence of the life of those who are in faith alone, (<a href="391.htm">391</a>).<p>Verse 3. "And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer," signifies spiritual worship, which is from the good of charity by the truths of faith, (<a href="392.htm">392</a>). "And there was given him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne," signifies propitiation lest the angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom should be hurt by the spirits of the satanic kingdom that were below, (<a href="393.htm">393</a>).<p>Verse 4. "And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the angel before God," signifies the protection of them by the Lord, (<a href="394.htm">394</a>).<p>Verse 5. "And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it unto the earth," signifies spiritual love, in which is celestial love, and its influx into lower things, where they were who were in faith separated from charity, (<a href="395.htm">395</a>). "And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake," signifies that after communication was opened with them, there were heard reasonings concerning faith alone, and confirmations in favor of it, (<a href="396.htm">396</a>).<p>Verse 6. "And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound," signifies that they were prepared and girded to explore the state of the church and thence the state of life with those whose religion is faith alone, (<a href="397.htm">397</a>).<p>Verse 7. "The first angel sounded," signifies the exploration and manifestation of the quality of the state of the church with those who are interiorly in that faith, (<a href="398.htm">398</a>). "And there became hail and fire mingled with blood," signifies falsity from infernal love destroying good and truth, and falsifying the Word, (<a href="399.htm">399</a>). "And they were cast upon the earth, and the third part of the trees was burnt up," signifies that with them, every affection and perception of truth, which constitute the man of the church, had perished, (<a href="400.htm">400</a>). "And all green grass was burnt up," signifies thus every living thing of faith, (<a href="401.htm">401</a>).<p>Verse 8. "And the second angel sounded," signifies the exploration and manifestation of what the state of the church is with those who are exteriorly in that faith, (<a href="402.htm">402</a>). "And as it were a mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea," signifies the appearance of infernal love with them, (<a href="403.htm">403</a>). "And the third part of the sea became blood," signifies that all general truths with them were falsified, (<a href="404.htm">404</a>).<p>Verse 9. "And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea that had souls, died," signifies that they who have lived and do live this faith cannot be reformed and receive life, (<a href="405.htm">405</a>). "And the third part of the ships perished," signifies that all the knowledges of good and truth from the Word, serving for the use of life, were destroyed with them, (<a href="406.htm">406</a>[1-4]). Verse <a href="3927/revelation_8_10.htm">10</a>. "And the third angel sounded," signifies the exploration and manifestation of the state of the church with those whose religion is faith alone, as to the affection and reception of truths from the Word, (<a href="407.htm">407</a>). "And there fell from heaven a great star, burning as it were a lamp," signifies the appearance of their own intelligence from pride arising from infernal love, (<a href="408.htm">408</a>). "And it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters," signifies that thence all the truths of the Word were altogether falsified, (<a href="409.htm">409</a>).<p>Verse 11. "And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood," signifies the infernal falsity from which their own intelligence is derived, by which all the truths of the Word are falsified, (<a href="410.htm">410</a>). "And many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter," signifies the extinction of spiritual life from the falsified truths of the Word, (<a href="411.htm">411</a>).<p>Verse 12. "And the fourth angel sounded," signifies the exploration and manifestation of the state of the church with those whose religion is faith alone, as being in the evils of falsity, and in the falsities of evil, (<a href="412.htm">412</a>). "And the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, and the third part of them was darkened," signifies that by reason of evils from falsities and of falsities from evils, they did not know what love is, or what faith is, or any truth, (<a href="413.htm">413</a>). "And the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise," signifies that there is no longer any spiritual truth nor natural truth serviceable for doctrine and life from the Word with them, (<a href="414.htm">414</a>).<p>Verse 13. "And I saw, and I heard an angel flying in the midst of heaven," signifies instruction and prediction from the Lord, (<a href="415.htm">415</a>). "Saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, to them that dwell on the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are about to sound," signifies the deepest lamentation over the damned state of those in the church, who in doctrine and life have confirmed themselves in faith separate from charity, (<a href="416.htm">416</a>).<p>THE EXPLANATION<p>There are two kingdoms into which the entire heaven is divided, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom. The celestial kingdom consists of those who are in love to the Lord and thence in wisdom; and the spiritual kingdom consists of those who are in love towards the neighbor, and thence in intelligence; and as love towards the neighbor is at this day called "charity" and intelligence, "faith," the latter kingdom consists of those who are in charity, and thence in faith. Now, because heaven is distinguished into two kingdoms, hell also is distinguished into two kingdoms that are opposite to them; into the diabolical kingdom and into the satanic kingdom. The diabolical kingdom consists of those who are in the love of dominion from love of self and thence in foolishness; for this love is opposite to celestial love, and its foolishness is opposite to celestial wisdom; but the satanic kingdom consists of those who are in the love of dominion from the pride of their own intelligence, and thence in insanity; for this love is opposite to spiritual love, and its insanity is opposite to spiritual intelligence. By foolishness and insanity are meant foolishness and insanity in things celestial and spiritual. Similar things are to be understood of the church on earth as are said of heaven, for they make one. Concerning these two kingdoms, see the work on Heaven and Hell, published at London, (<a href="20.htm">20-28</a>), and see also many other places.</p><p>[2] Now, as Revelation treats only of the state of the church at its end (as was observed in the preface, and at <a href="2.htm">2</a>), therefore what now follows treats of those who are in the two kingdoms of heaven, and of those who are in the two kingdoms of hell, and of their quality. From this chapter, (<a href="3927/revelation_8_8.htm">8:8-13</a>), of those who are in the spiritual kingdom, and in the satanic kingdom opposite to it; in chapters <a href="3927/revelation_17_1.htm">17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_18_1.htm">18</a>, of those who are in the celestial kingdom, and in the diabolical kingdom opposite to it; and afterwards of the Last Judgment; and at length of the New Church which is the New Jerusalem; this bringing all that goes before to a conclusion, because it is the end on account of which they are. In many parts of the Word "the Devil" and "Satan" are mentioned, and by both is meant hell; it is so named, because all in one hell are called devils, and all in the other are called satans. </p>

Regnum Caeleste consistit ex illis qui in amore in Dominum sunt et inde in sapientia; ac Regnum Spirituale, ex illis qui in amore erga proximum sunt et inde in intelligentia; et quia amor erga proximum hodie vocatur "charitas," ac intelligentia "fides," consistit hoc Regnum ex illis qui in charitate et inde fide sunt. Nunc quia Caelum in duo Regna distinctum est, etiam Infernum in duo Regna illis opposita distinctum est, in Regnum Diabolicum et in Regnum Satanicum. Regnum Diabolicum consistit ex illis qui in amore dominandi ex amore sui sunt, et inde in stultitia, est enim amor ille oppositus amori caelesti, ac stultitia ejus opposita sapientiae caelesti; Regnum autem Satanicum consistit ex illis qui in amore dominandi ex fastu propriae intelligentiae sunt, et inde in insania, est enim ille amor oppositus amori spirituali, ac insania ejus opposita intelligentiae spirituali: per stultitiam et insaniam intelligitur stultitia et insania in rebus caelestibus et spiritualibus. Similia intelligenda sunt de Ecclesia in terris, quae dicta sunt de Caelo, unum enim faciunt. De binis illis Regnis videatur Opus de Caelo et Inferno Londini editum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_387/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_20" target=_top>20-28</a>, et pluries alibi).<p>Nunc quia in Apocalypsi unice agitur de Statu Ecclesiae in fine ejus (ut in Praefatione et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_387/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_2" target=_top>2</a> dictum est), idcirco de illis qui in duobus Regnis Caeli, et de illis qui in duobus Regnis Inferni sunt, et quales sunt, ex nunc agitur; ab hoc capite, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_387/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_8_1-13" target=_top>8</a>) ad cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_387/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_16_1-21" target=_top>16</a> de illis qui in Regno Spirituali, et in Regno illi opposito Satanico sunt; in cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_387/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_17_1-18" target=_top>17</a> et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_387/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_18_1-24" target=_top>18</a>, de illis qui in Regno Caelesti et in Regno ei opposito Diabolico sunt; et postea de Ultimo Judicio; et demum de Nova Ecclesia, quae est Nova Hierosolyma; haec concludit omnia antecedentia, quia est finis propter quem. In Verbo passim nominatur "Diabolus" et "Satanas," et per utrumque intelligitur Infernum; nominatur ita, quia omnes in uno Inferno vocantur diaboli, et omnes in altero vocantur satanae.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;illorum pro "illarum" (Vide <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_387/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_413" target=_top>413</a>)" </p>
