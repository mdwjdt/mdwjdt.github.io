<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>324.启6:9.“揭开第五印的时候”表主审查那些在最后审判之日将要得救，与此同时得以保留之人的生活状态。从下文明显可知，此处论述这些事。不过，要知道，这些以及类似的事在整个第20章及以后得到充分论述。对此的解释可参看相关章节（<a href="840.htm">840</a>-<a href="874.htm">874</a>节），由此清楚可知他们是谁，为何得以保留。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 324</h4><p>324. When He opened the fifth seal. (<a href="3927/revelation_6_9.htm">6:9</a>) This symbolizes an examination by the Lord of the states of life of people who would be saved on the day of the Last Judgment, and who in the meantime were sequestered.<p>That these people are the subject here is apparent from what now follows. But it should be known that these and others like them are the subject throughout chapter 20ff., an explanation of which chapter may be seen in nos. <a href="840.htm">840-874</a>, which makes apparent just who they were and why they were sequestered. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 324</h4><p>324. [verse 9] 'And when He had opened the fifth seal' signifies examination by the Lord of the states of life of those who were to be saved at the day of judgment, and were reserved in the meantime. That it treats of these things is plain from the things now following. But it is to be known that it treats fully of these and similar things in chapter <a href="3927/revelation_20_1.htm">20</a> and onwards, the exposition of which may be seen from <a href="840.htm">840-874</a>, from which it is plain who they are and why they were reserved . </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 324</h4><p>324. Verse 9. And when He had opened the fifth seal, signifies exploration by the Lord of their states of life, who were to be saved at the day of the Last Judgment, and in the meantime were reserved. That these are here treated of, is evident from what now follows. But it is to be known that these, and the like, are treated of throughout the twentieth chapter, the explanation of which may be seen, <a href="840.htm">840-874</a>, manifesting who they are, and why reserved. </p>
