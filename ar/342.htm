align="center">诠释</h4><p>342.启7:1.“这些事以后，我看见四位天使站在地的四角”表整个天堂现正努力对处于灵人界者施行最后的审判。随之而来的许多事涉及就在最后审判之前的灵界状态，若不靠着主的启示，没有人能知道这些事。我蒙恩得以看到最后的审判以什么样的方式施行，包括审判前的变化，以及接下来的安排，所以我能由此讲述这一章以及后续各章所包含一切细节的含义。</p><p>此处“四位天使”表示整个天堂；“地的四角”表示天堂与地狱之间的整个灵人界；因为最后的审判施行在那些处于灵人界的人身上，而非处于天堂的任何人，也非处于地狱的任何人。“天使”之所以表示天堂，是因为“天使”在至高意义上表示主的神性人（<a href="344.htm">344</a>节）；由于天堂是靠着主而为天堂，故“天使”也表示天堂。</p><p>“四位天使”在此表示整个天堂，因为约翰看见他们站在“地的四角”，而“四个角”表示四个方位。上述这些话之所以表示整个天堂努力施行最后的审判，是因为当审判即将来临时，主使众天堂接近灵人界，因着众天堂的这种靠近，那些在下之人的心智内层会经历这种状态的变化，以致他们除了眼前的恐惧外，什么也看不见。</p><p>“角”表示方位（或译为面、边corner），因而“四角”表示所有方位。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>你们要从城外，量向东的角、向南的角，向西的角，向北的角。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民35.5.htm">35:5</a>）</p><p>你要给帐幕，给南面和北面做木板。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.18.htm">26:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.20.htm">20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.23.htm">23</a>）</p><p>院子的南面、北面、西面、东面。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.9.htm">27:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.11.htm">11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>四个方位在以西结书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.18.htm">47:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.20.htm">20</a>；｛48章）中还常被称为“四角”（four corners）</p><p>由于“角”表示方位，故它们也表示一切事物，如与天堂或地狱有关，亦或良善或真理有关的一切事物。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>撒旦要出来迷惑在地上四角的列族。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.8.htm">20:8</a>）</p><p>我要除灭列族，他们的城角荒凉。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番3.6.htm">3:6</a>）</p><p>以色列聚集起来，如同一人，各角落的众百姓都站立。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士20.1.htm">20:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/士20.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>必有一杖从以色列兴起，打碎摩押的四角。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.17.htm">24:17</a>）</p><p>是吹号吶喊的日子，要攻击高耸的城角楼。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.16.htm">1:16</a>）</p><p>我必将他们抛到极远的角落。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.26.htm">32:26</a>）</p><p>“角”表示支撑高层事物的最底层或最终层，犹如支撑房屋的地基，因而也表示一切事物。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>祂要在锡安找一块房角石，是稳固根基的宝石。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.16.htm">28:16</a>）</p><p>他们必不取石头为房角石。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.26.htm">51:26</a>）</p><p>必有一块房角石从犹大而出。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚10.4.htm">10:4</a>）</p><p>他们所弃的石头成了房角的头一块。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗118.22.htm">118:22</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.42.htm">21:42</a>；马可福音<a

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 342</h4><p>342. CHAPTER 7<p>1. After these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, on the sea, or on any tree.<p>2. Then I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea,<p>3. saying, "Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads."<p>4. And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of Israel:<p>5. of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand were sealed;<p>6. of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand were sealed;<p>7. of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand were sealed;<p>8. of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed.<p>9. After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude, which no one could number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands,<p>10. and crying out with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!"<p>11. And all the angels stood around the throne, with the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,<p>12. saying, "Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving, and honor and power and might, be to our God forever and ever. Amen."<p>13. Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, "Who are these arrayed in white robes, and where did they come from?"<p>14. And I said to him, "Lord, you know." So he said to me, "These are the ones who are coming out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes and made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb.<p>15. Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple. And He who sits on the throne will dwell among them.<p>16. They shall neither hunger anymore nor thirst anymore; neither shall the sun strike them, nor any heat;<p>17. for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to living fountains of waters. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."<p>THE SPIRITUAL MEANING<p>The Contents of the Whole Chapter<p>This chapter describes people who are and who will be in the Christian heaven. It describes first their separation from evil people (verses 1-3); after that, those of them who are impelled by love toward the Lord and so by wisdom, of whom the higher heavens consist (verses 4-8); and those who are impelled by charity from the Lord and its accompanying faith because they fought against evils, of whom the lower heavens consist (verses 9-17).<p>The Contents of the Individual Verses:<p></p><table><thead><tr><th>Verse Contents</th><th>Spiritual Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. After these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth,</td><td>The whole of heaven now in an effort to execute the Last Judgment.</td></tr><tr><td>holding back the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, on the sea, or on any tree.</td><td>The Lord's holding back and restraining a closer and thus stronger influx into the lower regions where good people were attached to evil ones.</td></tr><tr><td>2. Then I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun,</td><td>The Lord providing and moderating,</td></tr><tr><td>having the seal of the living God.</td><td>who alone knows the character of each and every person, and can distinguish and separate them from each other.</td></tr><tr><td>And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea, 3. saying, "Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees</td><td>The Lord's restraining and holding back the closer and stronger influx into the lower regions,</td></tr><tr><td>till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads."</td><td>before those people were separated who were governed by truths springing from goodness from the Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>4. And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand,</td><td>All people who acknowledge the Lord as God of heaven and earth and are governed by truths of doctrine springing from the goodness of love, received from Him through the Word.</td></tr><tr><td>sealed out of every tribe of Israel:</td><td>The heaven and the Lord's church formed from them.</td></tr><tr><td>5. of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed;</td><td>Celestial love, which is love toward the Lord, and this in all those people who will be in the New Heaven and in the New Church.</td></tr><tr><td>of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand were sealed;</td><td>Wisdom springing from celestial love in those people who will be there.</td></tr><tr><td>of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand were sealed;</td><td>Useful life endeavors, which are the exercises of wisdom springing from that love, in those people who will be there.</td></tr><tr><td>6. of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand were sealed;</td><td>Mutual love in those people.</td></tr><tr><td>of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand were sealed;</td><td>A perception of useful endeavor, and of what is useful, in those people.</td></tr><tr><td>of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand were sealed;</td><td>A will to serve and to put into practice in those people.</td></tr><tr><td>7. of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand were sealed;</td><td>Spiritual love, which is love for the neighbor, in those people.</td></tr><tr><td>of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand were sealed;</td><td>An affection for truth springing from goodness, producing intelligence in those people.</td></tr><tr><td>of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand were sealed;</td><td>Goodness of life in those people.</td></tr><tr><td>8. of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand were sealed;</td><td>The conjugal love of goodness and truth in those people.</td></tr><tr><td>of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand were sealed;</td><td>A doctrine of goodness and truth in those people.</td></tr><tr><td>of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed.</td><td>A life of truth springing from goodness in accord with doctrine in those people.</td></tr><tr><td>9. After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude, which no one could number,</td><td>All other people who are not among those enumerated and yet are in the New Heaven and the Lord's New Church, who form the lowest heaven and the external church, and whose character is known to the Lord alone.</td></tr><tr><td>of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues,</td><td>All in the Christian world who have some religion springing from goodness and are guided by truths from doctrine,</td></tr><tr><td>standing before the throne and before the Lamb,</td><td>listening to the Lord and doing what He commands.</td></tr><tr><td>clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands,</td><td>A communication and conjunction with the higher heavens, and a confession springing from Divine truths.</td></tr><tr><td>10. and crying out with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!"</td><td>An acknowledgment from the heart that the Lord is their Savior.</td></tr><tr><td>11. And all the angels stood around the throne, with the elders and the four living creatures,</td><td>All in the whole of heaven listening and doing what the Lord commands.</td></tr><tr><td>and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,</td><td>A humbling of their heart, and in their humility an adoration of the Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>12. saying, "Amen!</td><td>Divine truth and an affirmation in response to it.</td></tr><tr><td>Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving,</td><td>The Lord's spiritual Divine attributes;</td></tr><tr><td>and honor and power and might,</td><td>the Lord's celestial Divine attributes;</td></tr><tr><td>be to our God forever and ever.</td><td>these being in the Lord and emanating from the Lord to eternity.</td></tr><tr><td>Amen."</td><td>The agreement of all.</td></tr><tr><td>13. Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, "Who are these arrayed in white robes, and where did they come from?" 14. And I said to him, "Lord, you know."</td><td>Their desire to know and wish to inquire, and the reply and instruction given.</td></tr><tr><td>So he said to me, "These are ones who are coming out of the great tribulation,</td><td>They are people who have undergone temptations or trials, and have fought against evils and falsities,</td></tr><tr><td>and have washed their robes</td><td>who have cleansed their religious beliefs of the evils accompanying falsity,</td></tr><tr><td>and made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb.</td><td>and by truths have purified those religious beliefs from the falsities accompanying evil, and so have been reformed by the Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>15. Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple. And He who sits on the throne will dwell among them.</td><td>They are in the Lord's presence, and live constantly and faithfully in His church in accordance with the truths that they receive from Him.</td></tr><tr><td>16. They shall neither hunger anymore nor thirst anymore;</td><td>Hereafter they will not lack goods and truths.</td></tr><tr><td>neither shall the sun strike them, nor any heat;</td><td>Hereafter they will not possess lusts for evil, nor for the falsity accompanying evil.</td></tr><tr><td>17. for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them</td><td>The Lord alone will teach them</td></tr><tr><td>and lead them to living fountains of waters.</td><td>and lead them by the truths in the Word to conjunction with Him.</td></tr><tr><td>And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."</td><td>They will be caught up no longer in battles against evils and the accompanying falsities, and so will no longer experience times of distress, but will be surrounded by goods and truths and thus by heavenly joys emanating from the Lord.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>THE EXPOSITION<p>After these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth. (<a href="3927/revelation_7_1.htm">7:1</a>) This symbolizes the whole of heaven now in an effort to execute the Last Judgment on the people who were in the world of spirits.<p>There follows now much concerning the state of the spiritual world just before the Last Judgment, which no one could know without its being revealed by the Lord. And because I have been given to see how the Last Judgment was executed, including the transformations which preceded it and the dispositions following it, I can relate therefore the symbolic meaning of everything in this chapter and in the chapters that follow.</p><p>[2] The four angels here symbolize the whole of heaven. The four corners of the earth symbolize the entire world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell. For the Last Judgment was executed on people who were in the world of spirits, and not on anyone in heaven, nor on anyone in hell.<p>Angels symbolize heaven because an angel in the highest sense means the Lord in respect to His Divine humanity (no. <a href="344.htm">344</a>), and as heaven is heaven owing to the Lord, angels symbolize heaven as well.</p><p>[3] The four angels here symbolize the whole of heaven because they were seen standing at the four corners of the earth, and the four corners symbolize the four quarters of the compass.<p>They symbolize that the whole of heaven was now in an effort to execute the Last Judgment for the reason that when the Last Judgment was at hand, the Lord caused the heavens to draw closer over the world of spirits, and the closeness of the heavens produced such a change in the state of the inner constituents of the people's minds below that they saw nothing but terrors before their eyes.</p><p>[4] That corners symbolize quarters of the compass, and thus the four quarters all points, can be seen from the following passages:<p>You shall measure, outside the city, the corner toward the east..., the corner toward the south..., the corner toward the west..., and the corner toward the north... (<a href="3927/numbers_35_5.htm">Numbers 35:5</a>)<p>You shall make the boards for the Tabernacle, ...for the south corner..., and for... the north corner... (<a href="3927/exodus_26_18.htm">Exodus 26:18</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_23.htm">23</a>)<p>And... the court..., for the south corner..., for the north corner..., for the west corner..., and... for the east corner... (<a href="3927/exodus_27_9.htm">Exodus 27:9</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_27_11.htm">11-13</a>)</p><p>[5] The four quarters are also called four corners often in Ezekiel, as in <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_18.htm">Ezekiel 47:18-20</a>, and 48.<p>Since corners symbolize the quarters of the compass, they also therefore symbolize everything, such as everything in heaven or in hell, or everything pertaining to goodness or to truth, as is apparent from the following:<p>(Satan) will go out to lead astray the nations which are at the four corners of the earth... (<a href="3927/revelation_20_8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>)<p>I will cut off nations, (and) their corners will be devastated. (<a href="3927/zephaniah_3_6.htm">Zephaniah 3:6</a>)<p>...(Israel) gathered together as one man... And the corners of all the people stationed themselves... (<a href="3927/judges_20_1.htm">Judges 20:1-2</a>)<p>A scepter shall rise out of Israel, and crush the corners of Moab... (<a href="3927/numbers_24_17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>)<p>A day of trumpet and alarm... upon the high corners. (<a href="3927/zephaniah_1_16.htm">Zephaniah 1:16</a>)<p>I will cast them into the ends of the corners. (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_26.htm">Deuteronomy 32:26</a>)</p><p>[6] That a corner symbolizes the lowest component supporting higher ones, as a foundation does a house, and so symbolizes also everything, is apparent from the following:<p>(He) will lay in Zion a corner stone..., the price of the laying of a foundation. (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>)<p>They shall not take from it a stone for a corner... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_26.htm">Jeremiah 51:26</a>)<p>From (Judah) shall come the corner stone... (<a href="3927/zechariah_10_4.htm">Zechariah 10:4</a>)<p>The stone which (they) rejected has become the corner stone.

Many things now follow concerning the state of the spiritual world just before the last judgment. No one is able to know these things except by means of revelation from the Lord. And because it has been given to me to see how the last judgment has been carried through, and also the changes that have preceded it, and the orderly arrangements that have followed, I am able in consequence to report the things, in this chapter and those that follow, that are signified by all [the statements] therein.</p><p>[2] Here, by 'four angels' is signified the entire heaven; by 'the four corners of the land' is signified the entire world of spirits, which is intermediate between heaven and hell; for the last judgment was effected on those who were in the world of spirits, but not on any in heaven nor on any in hell. Heaven is signified by 'angels' because by 'angel' in the highest sense is understood the Lord as to the Divine Human (<a href="344.htm">344</a>); and because heaven is heaven from the Lord, by 'angels' heaven is also signified.</p><p>[3] The entire heaven is signified by 'four angels' here because they were seen to stand 'upon the four corners of the land,' and, by 'the four corners' the four quarters are signified. It is signified that the entire heaven was now in the effort to effect the last judgment, because the Lord, when the judgment was impending, caused the heavens to draw near over the world of spirits, and by the approach of the heavens there was effected such a change of state of the interiors of the minds with those below that they saw nothing but terrors before their eyes.</p><p>[4] That 'corners' signify quarters, and consequently that 'the four corners' signify all the quarters, can be established from the following passages:<p>You shall measure outside the city, the corner towards the east (ortus), the corner towards the south, the corner towards the west, and the corner towards the north. <a href="3927/numbers_35_5.htm">Numbers 35:5</a>.<p>Thou shalt make the posts for the dwelling for the corner of the south, and for the corner of the north thereof, <a href="3927/exodus_26_18.htm">Exodus 26:18</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_23.htm">23</a>.<p>And the court, to the south corner, to the north corner, to the west corner and to the east (oriens) corner, <a href="3927/exodus_27_9.htm">Exodus 27:9</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_27_11.htm">11-13</a>.<p>The four quarters are also frequently called 'the four corners' in Ezekiel, as in chapter <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_18.htm">47:18-20</a> and chapter <a href="3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">48</a>.</p><p> [5] Since 'corners' signify quarters, therefore they also signify all things, as all things of heaven or of hell, or of good or truth, which is plain from these statements:<p>Satan shall go forth to lead astray the nations that are at the four corners of the land. <a href="3927/revelation_20_8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>.<p>I will cut off the nations, and their corners shall be devastated, <a href="3927/zephaniah_3_6.htm">Zephaniah 3:6</a>.<p>Israel was gathered together as one man, and the corners of all the people stood firm, <a href="3927/judges_20_1.htm">Judges 20:1-2</a>.<p>A sceptre shall rise out of Israel, that shall wear down the corners of Moab. <a href="3927/numbers_24_17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>.<p>A day of the trumpet and of clangour upon the high corners, <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_16.htm">Zephaniah 1:16</a>.<p>Into the farthest corners will I cast them out. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_26.htm">Deuteronomy 32:26</a>.</p><p>[6] That a 'corner' signifies an ultimate that holds up higher things, as the foundation does a house, and thus also signifies all things, is plain from these statements:<p>He will found in Zion the stone of the corner, of the price of the founding of the foundation. <a href="3927/isaiah_28_16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>.<p>And they shall not take of it a stone for the corner. <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_26.htm">Jeremiah 51:26</a>.<p>Out of Judah shall be the corner-stone, <a href="3927/zechariah_10_4.htm">Zechariah 10:4</a>.<p>The stone which they rejected is become the head of the corner. <a href="3927/psalms_118_22.htm">Psalms 118:22</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_21_42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>; <a href="3927/mark_12_10.htm">Mark 12:10</a>; <a href="3927/luke_20_17.htm">Luke 20:17-18</a>. </p>

"For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them," signifies that the Lord alone will teach them, (<a href="383.htm">383</a>). "And shall lead them to living fountains of waters," signifies, and shall lead by truths of the Word to conjunction with Himself, (<a href="384.htm">384</a>). "And God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes" signifies that they shall no longer be in combats against evils and their falsities, and thereby in grief, but in goods and truths, and thence in heavenly joys from the Lord.<p>THE EXPLANATION<p>Verse 1. Afterwards I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, signifies the entire heaven now in the effort to execute the Last Judgment on those who were in the world of spirits. Many things now follow concerning the state of the spiritual world just before the Last Judgment, which no one could know but by revelation from the Lord. And since it has been granted me to see in what manner the Last Judgment was executed, and also the changes which preceded it, and the arrangements which followed; I am thereby enabled to relate the signification of all the particulars contained in this and the following chapters.</p><p>[2] By "the four angels" is here signified the entire heaven; by "the four corners of the earth" is signified the entire world of spirits, which is in the midst between heaven and hell; for the Last Judgment was executed on those who were in the world of spirits, but not on anyone in heaven, nor anyone in hell. The reason why "the angels" signify heaven is because "an angel," in the highest sense, means the Lord as to the Divine Human, (<a href="344.htm">344</a>); and as heaven is heaven from the Lord, by "the angels" is also signified heaven.</p><p>[3] "The four angels" here signify the entire heaven, because they were seen "standing on the four corners of the earth," and by the "four corners" are signified the four quarters. The reason why the above words signify the effort of the entire heaven to execute the Last Judgment is because the Lord, when the judgment was at hand, caused the heavens to draw near over the world of spirits, and by this approach of the heavens, such a change of state in the interiors of the minds of those who were below, was effected, that they saw nothing but terrors before their eyes.</p><p>[4] That "corners" signify quarters, and thence "the four corners" all quarters, may appear from the following passages:<p>Ye shall measure without the city, the corner towards the east, the corner towards the south, the corner towards the west, and the corner towards the north, (<a href="3927/numbers_35_5.htm">Numbers 35:5</a>).<p>Thou shalt make the boards for the habitation for the corner of the south, and for the corner of the north, (<a href="3927/exodus_26_18.htm">Exodus 26:18</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_23.htm">23</a>).<p>And a court for the corner of the south, for the corner of the north, for the corner of the west, and for the corner of the east, (<a href="3927/exodus_27_9.htm">Exodus 27:9</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_27_11.htm">11-13</a>).<p>The four quarters are also called "the four corners" frequently in Ezekiel, as in chapters <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_8.htm">47:8-20</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">48:1-30</a>.</p><p>[5] Because "corners" signify quarters, therefore they also signify all things, as all things relating to heaven or hell, or of good or truth, as is plain from these passages:<p>Satan shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, (<a href="3927/revelation_20_8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>).<p>I have cut off the nations, and their corners are devastated, (<a href="3927/zephaniah_3_6.htm">Zephaniah 3:6</a>).<p>Israel was gathered together as one man, and the corners of all the people stood up, (<a href="3927/judges_20_1.htm">Judges 20:1-2</a>).<p>A scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall break in pieces the corners of Moab, (<a href="3927/numbers_24_17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>).<p>A day of trumpet and alarm and upon the high corners, (<a href="3927/zephaniah_1_16.htm">Zephaniah 1:16</a>).<p>I will cast them out into the farthest corners, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_26.htm">Deuteronomy 32:26</a>).</p><p>[6] That "a corner" signifies the ultimate which sustains things higher, as the foundation does a house, and thus also all things, appears from these passages:<p>He will found in Zion a cornerstone, a precious established foundation, (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>).<p>And they shall not take of that stone for a corner, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_26.htm">Jeremiah 51:26</a>).<p>From Judah shall be a cornerstone, (<a href="3927/zechariah_10_4.htm">Zechariah 10:4</a>).<p>The stone which they rejected is become the head of the corner, (<a href="3927/psalms_118_22.htm">Psalms 118:22</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_21_42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>; <a href="3927/mark_12_10.htm">Mark 12:10</a>; <a href="3927/luke_20_17.htm">Luke 20:17-18</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original Latin omits "of the sons."<br><br>2.&nbsp;The original Latin omits "o, (<a href="3927/revelation_7_1.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>) f the sons."<p>3.&nbsp;The original Latin omits "And they fell down before the throne upon their faces, and adored God." It is explained in the chapter, (<a href="370.htm">370</a>). </p>

"Postea vidi quatuor Angelos stantes super quatuor angulis terrae," significat nunc universum Caelum in conatu ad faciendum Ultimum Judicium - super illos qui in Mundo spirituum erant. Sequuntur nunc plura de statu mundi spiritualis proximo ante Ultimum Judicium, quae nemo scire potest nisi per revelationem a Domino; et quia mihi datum est videre quomodo Ultimum Judicium peractum est, et quoque mutationes quae praecesserunt, et ordinationes quae secutae sunt, possum inde referre, quae in hoc capite et quae in sequentibus per omnia ibi significantur. Hic per "quatuor Angelos" significatur Universum Caelum; per "quatuor angulos terrae" significatur Universus Mundus spirituum, qui inter Caelum et Infernum medius est; super illos enim qui in Mundo spirituum erant, factum est Ultimum Judicium, non autem super aliquem in Caelo, nec super aliquem in Inferno: quod per "Angelos" significetur Caelum, est quia per "Angelum" in supremo Sensu intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_342/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_344" target=_top>344</a>), et quia Caelum est Caelum a Domino, per "Angelos" etiam significatur Caelum: quod per "quatuor Angelos" hic significetur universum Caelum, est quia visi sunt "stare super quatuor angulis terrae;" et per "quatuor angulos" significantur quatuor plagae.
