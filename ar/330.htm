<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第330节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>330.启6:12.“揭开第六印的时候，我观看”表主审查那些内心邪恶，即将受最后审判之人的生活状态。从接下来的内容明显可知所论述的是这些人；不过，为理解他们，有两个奥秘要揭示出来：</p><p>第一：最后的审判不是临到其他人身上，而是临到那些表面上看像基督徒，口头上也信奉教会事物，而内在或内心里却反对它们的人；他们因具有这种性质，故在其外在事物上与底层天结合，而在其内在事物上则与地狱结合。</p><p>第二：只要他们与底层天结合，其意愿与爱的内在就关闭，他们的邪恶因此就不会显现在其他人面前；不过，一旦他们与底层天分离，其内在便暴露无遗，结果发现与其外在截然相反；他们通过这外在掩饰并伪装，他们就是天上的天使，他们所居之地就是天堂。</p><p>这些所谓的天堂，就是最后审判之时那已经过去了的“先前的天”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.1.htm">21:1</a>）。有关该主题的更多详情，可参看《最后的审判》（<a href="../lj/70.htm">70</a>-71节）这本小册子，以及《最后的审判（续）》（<a href="../clj/10.htm">10</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 330</h4><p>330. Then I looked when He opened the sixth seal. (<a href="3927/revelation_6_12.htm">6:12</a>) This symbolizes an examination by the Lord of the states of life of people who were inwardly evil, on whom the Last Judgment would fall.<p>That these people are the subject is apparent from what now follows. But for those things to be understood, two secrets need to be revealed:<p>First, that the Last Judgment was not executed on any but people who in outward appearance seemed to be Christians, professing with their mouth matters having to do with the church, but who in their inner makeup or heart were in opposition to them. And because they were of such a character, therefore as to their outward lives they were conjoined with the lowest heaven, and as to their inner ones, with hell.<p>Second, that as long as they were conjoined with the lowest heaven, the inner qualities of their will and love were kept closed off, so that they did not appear evil to others. But when they were separated from the lowest heaven, then their inner qualities were disclosed, which were in total opposition to their outer qualities, qualities by which they had pretended and feigned themselves to be angels of heaven and the places where they dwelled to be heavens. These so-called heavens were the ones that passed away at the time of the Last Judgment (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>).<p>More on this subject, however, may be seen in the short work, The Last Judgment, nos. <a href="70.htm">70</a>, <a href="71.htm">71</a>, and in A Continuation Concerning the Last Judgment, no. <a href="../clj/10.htm">10</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 330</h4><p>330. [verse 12] 'And I saw when He had opened the sixth seal' signifies the examination by the Lord of the states of life of those who were interiorly evil, upon whom there is going to be the judgment. That it treats of these things is plain from those now following; but in order that they may be understood two arcana must be revealed:<p>THE FIRST: that the last judgment took place upon no others than those who appeared in outward form like Christians, and orally professed the things that are of the Church, but were in inward form or at heart, against them; and because they were such, therefore they had been conjoined as to their exterior things with the ultimate heaven, and as to their interior things with hell.<p>THE SECOND: that as long as they had been conjoined with the ultimate heaven, so long the internals of their will and love had been closed, as a result of which they did not appear evil before others; but when they were separated from the ultimate heaven, then their interior things were laid open, and these were in every respect opposite to the exterior things by virtue of which they had pretended and lied that they were angels, and that the places where they were dwelling were heavens. These were the 'heavens,' so called, that 'passed away' at the time of the last judgment (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>).<p>But more may be seen concerning these things in the little work concerning <a href="../lj/70.htm">THE LAST JUDGMENT 70-71</a>; and in <a href="../clj/10.htm">the CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE LAST JUDGMENT 10</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 330</h4><p>330. Verse 12. And I saw when He had opened the sixth seal, signifies exploration by the Lord of their state of life, who were interiorly evil, and on whom the Last Judgment was to be executed. That these are treated of is evident from what now follows; but that they may be understood, two arcana are to be revealed: First, that the Last Judgment was executed only on such as appeared in their external form as Christians, and orally professed the things of the church, but in their internal form, or in heart, they were against them; and because they were such, they were therefore in conjunction with the ultimate heaven as to their exteriors, but with hell as to their interiors. Secondly, that as long as they were in conjunction with the ultimate heaven, so long the internals of their will and their love were closed, for which reason they did not appear evil before others; but when they were separated from the ultimate heaven, then their interiors were disclosed, and found to be totally in opposition to their exteriors, from which they dissembled and feigned that they were angels of heaven, and that the places they inhabited were heavens. These heavens, so called, were those which passed away at the time of the Last Judgment, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). But more on this subject may be seen in the small work on <a href="../lj/70.htm">The Last Judgment 70</a>, <a href="../lj/71.htm">71</a>; and in <a href="../clj/10.htm">The Continuation of the Last Judgment 10</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 330 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>330. (Vers. 12.) "Et vidi cum aperuisset sigillum sextum," significat a Domino Explorationem status vitae illorum qui interius mali erant, super quos Judicium futurum est. Quod de his agatur, patet a nunc sequentibus; sed ut illa intelligantur, duo Arcana revelanda sunt; Primum, quod Ultimum Judicium non super alios factum sit, quam qui in externa forma apparuerunt sicut Christiani, et ore professi sunt illa quae Ecclesiae sunt, sed in interna forma seu corde fuerunt contra illa; et quia tales, ideo quoad exteriora conjuncti fuerunt cum Caelo ultimo, et quoad interiora cum Inferno; Alterum, quod quamdiu conjuncti fuerunt cum Caelo ultimo, tamdiu clausa essent interna voluntatis et amoris eorum, ex quo non apparuerunt mali coram aliis; at cum separati sunt a Caelo ultimo, tunc reclusa sunt interiora illorum, quae in omni opposito fuerunt cum exterioribus, ex quibus simulaverunt et mentiti sunt quod Angeli Caeli essent, et quod loca ubi habitabant, essent Caeli: hi Caeli ita vocati, erant qui tempore Ultimi Judicii transiverunt, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_330/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_1" target=_top>Apocalypsis 21:1</a>). Sed plura de his videantur in Opusculo de Ultimo Judicio (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_330/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_70" target=_top>70</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_330/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_71" target=_top>71</a>) et in Continuatione de Ultimo Judicio (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_330/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_10" target=_top>10</a>). </p>
