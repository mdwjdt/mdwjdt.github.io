<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第73节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>73.“你要写信给以弗所教会的天使说”表写给并涉及那些首先关注教义真理，而非生活良善之人。前面已说明（<a href="66.htm">66</a>节），“七个教会”不是指七个教会，而是指整体上的教会，该教会本身为一，只是照着接受程度而各异；这些多样性好比全身合而为一的各种肢体和器官，还好比王冠上的各种珠宝。正因如此，下文以“七个教会”来描述整个新教会及其多样性。至于“以弗所教会”表示那些首先关注教义真理，而非生活良善之人，这一点从写给该教会的那些事的灵义清楚可知。之所以写给该教会的“天使”，是因为一位天使就表示一个对应于这类人所组成的教会的天使社群（如<a href="65.htm">65</a>节所述）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 73</h4><p>73. "To the angel of the church of Ephesus write." (<a href="3927/revelation_2_1.htm">2:1</a>) This symbolically means, to people and concerning people who regard doctrinal truths primarily, and not goods of life.<p>In no. <a href="66.htm">66</a> above we showed that the seven churches do not mean seven churches, but the church in its entirety, which in itself is one, but varied in accordance with people's reception. We said as well that these variations may be compared to the various members and organs in an intact body, which nevertheless form a single unit; indeed that they may be compared to the various jewels in a royal crown; and that that is why the seven churches describe the entire New Church in its varieties in what now follows.<p>That the church of Ephesus means people in the church who regard doctrinal truths primarily, and not goods of life, is apparent from the particulars written to it, understood in their spiritual sense.<p>The letter was written to the angel of that church, because the angel means the angelic society corresponding to a church consisting of such people, as indicated in no. <a href="65.htm">65</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 73</h4><p>73. [verse 1] 'To the Angel of the Ephesian Church write' signifies to and concerning those who have the truths of doctrine primarily in view, and not the goods of life. It has been shown above (<a href="66.htm">66</a>), that by 'the seven Churches' are not understood seven Churches, but the Church in its whole compass; and this in itself is one, but varying in accordance with reception; and that those variations can be compared to the various members and organs in a complete body, which yet make one; or that they can be compared to various diadems in a king's crown; and that this is why the entire New Church with its varieties is described by 'the seven Churches' in the things now following. That by 'the Ephesian Church' are understood those in the Church who have the truths of doctrine primarily in view, and not the goods of life, is plain from the things written to that Church understood in the spiritual sense. It is written to the Angel of that Church, because by 'the Angel' is understood the angelic society that corresponds to a Church [consisting] of such, as <a href="65.htm">65</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 73</h4><p>73. Verse 1. Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write, signifies, to those and concerning those, who primarily regard the truths of doctrine and not the goods of life. It was shown above, (<a href="66.htm">66</a>), that by "the seven churches" are not meant seven churches, but the church in the whole complex, which in itself is one, but various according to reception; and that those varieties may be compared with the various members and organs in a perfect body, which yet make one. They may also be compared with the various diadems in a king's crown; and hence it is that the whole New Church, with its varieties, is described, in what now follows, by "the seven churches." That by the church of Ephesus, are meant those in the church who primarily regard the truths of doctrine and not the goods of life, is clear from the things written to that church, when understood in the spiritual sense. It is written to "the angel" of that church, because by an angel is meant an angelic society which corresponds to a church consisting of such, as above, (<a href="65.htm">65</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 73 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>73. (Vers. 1.) "Angelo Ephesinae Ecclesiae scribe," significat ad illos et de illis, qui primario spectant vera doctrinae et non bona vitae. Supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_73/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_66" target=_top>66</a>) ostensum est, quod per "Septem Ecclesias" non intelligantur Septem Ecclesiae, sed Ecclesia in toto complexu, quae in Se una est, sed varia secundum receptionem; et quod varietates illae comparari possint variis membris et organis in perfecto corpore, quae tamen unum faciunt; imo quod comparari possint variis diadematibus in Corona Regis; et quod Inde sit, quod universa nova Ecclesia cum suis variis in nunc sequentibus per "Septem Ecclesias" describatur. Quod per "Ephesinam Ecclesiam" intelligantur illi in Ecclesia, qui primario spectant vera doctrinae, et non bona vitae, patet a scriptis ad illam in Sensu spirituali intellectis. Quod ad "Angelum" istius Ecclesiae scribatur, est quia per Angelum intelligitur Societas Angelica quae Ecclesiae ex talibus correspondet, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_73/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_65" target=_top>65</a>). </p>
