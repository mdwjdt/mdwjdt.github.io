<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第95节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>95.“苦难和贫穷”表他们处于虚假，因而不处于良善。“知道他们的苦难”表看见他们处于虚假；“知道他们的贫穷”表看见他们并未处于良善，因为在圣言中，“苦难”论及虚假（<a href="33.htm">33</a>节）；“贫穷”论及良善的缺乏；属灵的贫穷不是别的什么。圣言常提及 “困苦穷乏”，在灵义上，“困苦”表未处于真理之人，“穷乏”表未处于良善之人。后面还加了一句：“你却是富足的”，放在括号内，因为某些抄本没有这句话。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 95</h4><p>95. "'And tribulation, and poverty.'" This symbolically means that they are caught up in falsities and so are not engaged in good practices.<p>Knowing their tribulation means, symbolically, seeing that they are caught up in falsities, and knowing their poverty means, symbolically, seeing that they are not engaged in good practices. For tribulation in the Word is predicated of falsities, as in no. <a href="33.htm">33</a> above, while poverty is predicated of the absence of goods. That is what spiritual poverty is. The Word quite often speaks of the poor and needy, and in the spiritual sense a poor person means someone who is lacking in truths, and a needy person someone who is lacking in goods.<p>Added to the verse are also these words, "But you are rich," though in parentheses, and this because they are not found in some codices. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 95</h4><p>95. 'And affliction and poverty' signifies that they are in untruths, and consequently not in goods. To know their 'affliction' signifies to see that they are in untruths, and to know their 'poverty' signifies to see that they are not in goods; for in the Word 'affliction' is predicated of untruths, as above (<a href="33.htm">33</a>), and 'poverty' of things not good, spiritual poverty being nothing else. In the Word one often reads of 'the poor and the needy,' and by 'poor' in the spiritual sense is understood one who is not in truths, while by 'needy' one who is not in goods. There are also added the words 'yet thou art rich,' but in a parenthesis, and this because in certain codices they have been omitted. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 95</h4><p>95. And affliction and poverty, signifies that they are in falsities and thence not in goods. "To know their affliction" signifies to see that they are in falsities, and "to know their poverty" signifies to see that they are not in goods, for in the Word, "affliction" is predicated of falsities (as above, <a href="33.htm">33</a>); and "poverty" of the lack of goods; spiritual poverty is nothing else. "The poor and needy" are often mentioned in the Word, and in the spiritual sense by "poor" is meant one who is not in truths, and by "needy" one who is not in goods. These words are also added, "yet thou art rich," but in a parenthesis, and this because in some codices they are omitted. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 95 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>95. "Et afflictionem et egestatem" significat quod in falsis sint, et inde non in bonis. - "Nosse afflictionem illorum" significat videre quod in falsis sint, et "nosse egestatem" significat videre quod non in bonis; "afflictio" enim in Verbo praedicatur de falsis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_95/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_33" target=_top>33</a>), et "egestas" de non bonis; egestas spiritualis nec aliud est: saepius in Verbo legitur "Pauper et Egenus," et in spirituali Sensu per "pauperem" intelligitur qui non in veris est, ac per "egenum" qui non in bonis. Adjiciuntur quoque haec verba, "Dives tamen es," sed in parenthesi, et hoc quia in quibusdam codicibus omissa sunt. </p>
