<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第746节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>746.启17:16.“你所看见在那兽上的十角，这些必恨这淫妇”表圣言出于神性真理的能力在完全摆脱教皇统治枷锁的新教教徒当中。此处和前面（｛17:12）一样，都说到“你所看见的十角”；但前面说它们是“十王”，而此处却说“这些”，因为前面和此处一样，论述的是那些从天主教退出的人；然而，前面论述的人是部分地或某种程度地退出，但此处论述的人则是完全退出。</p><p>此处论述的是新教或改革宗，这一点从接下来的事明显看出来：他们使大淫妇冷落赤身，又要吃她的肉，用火将她烧尽，并将他们的国给那兽。“你所看见在那兽上的十角”表示圣言出于神性真理的能力（<a href="740.htm">740</a>节）。“恨这淫妇”是指不再容忍天主教，因而摆脱教皇统治的枷锁。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 746</h4><p>746. <a href="3927/revelation_17_16.htm">17:16</a> "And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these will hate the harlot." This symbolizes the Word as to the power it has from Divine truths among Protestants, who have thrown off entirely the yoke of papal dominion. We find the phrase here, as in verse <a href="3927/revelation_17_12.htm">12</a> above, "the ten horns which you saw on the beast," where it says that they were ten kings, but here simply "these," because there, as here, the subject is people who have turned away from the Roman Catholic religion - there people who have done so partly, but here people who have done so entirely.<p>That Protestants or the Reformed are the subject here is apparent from the predictions that follow, that they will make the harlot desolate and naked, eat her flesh and burn her with fire, and give their kingdom to the beast. That "the ten horns which you saw on the beast" symbolize the Word as to the power it has from Divine truths - this may be seen in no <a href="740.htm">740</a> above. That to hate the harlot is not to endure the Roman Catholic religion, and therefore to throw off entirely the yoke of papal dominion, is apparent without explanation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 746</h4><p>746. [verse 16] 'And the ten horns that thou hast seen upon the beast, these shall hate the harlot' signifies the Word as to its power derived from Divine Truths with the Protestants, who have altogether cast off from themselves the yoke of Papal dominion. It is said here, as above (verse 12), 'the ten horns that thou hast seen.' There they are 'ten kings,' but here 'these,' because there as here it treats of those who have withdrawn from the Roman Catholic form of religion. There, however, they have partly withdrawn, but here altogether. That this treats of the Protestants or Reformed is plain from the things following: that 'they shall make the harlot desolate and naked, shall eat her flesh, and burn her up with fire, and give their kingdom to the beast.' That by 'the ten horns that thou hast seen upon the beast' is signified the Word as to its power derived from Divine Truths may be seen above (<a href="740.htm">740</a>). 'To hate the harlot' is not to endure the Roman Catholic form of religion, and therefore to cast off from themselves the yoke of Papal dominion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 746</h4><p>746. Verse 16. And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the harlot, signifies the Word as to power from the Divine truths with the Protestants, who have altogether rejected from themselves the yoke of the papal domination. It is said here, as above (verse <a href="3927/revelation_17_12.htm">12</a>), "the ten horns which thou sawest;" but there they are "ten kings;" but here, "these:" because there, as here, those who have receded from the Roman Catholic religious persuasion are treated of; yet there those who have receded in part; but here, altogether. That it here treats of the Protestants or Reformed, is manifest from these things that follow: that they shall make the harlot desolate and naked, shall eat her flesh and shall burn her up with fire, and they shall give their kingdom to the beast. That the Word as to power from Divine truths is signified by the "ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast," may be seen above, (<a href="740.htm">740</a>). "To hate the harlot" is, not to endure the Roman Catholic religious persuasion, and therefore to cast off from themselves the yoke of the papal dominion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 746 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>746. (Vers. 16.) "Et decem Cornua quae vidisti super Bestia, hi odio habebunt Meretricem," significat Verbum quoad potentiam ex Divinis Veris apud Protestantes, qui jugum Dominii Papalis a se prorsus rejecerunt. - Dicitur, hic ut supra (vers. 12), "decem cornua quae vidisti;" ibi, "decem reges sunt," hic autem, "hi;" quia ibi sicut hic agitur de illis qui a Religioso Catholico Romano recesserunt, sed ibi illi quoad partem, hi autem prorsus. Quod hic agatur de Protestantibus seu Reformatis, patet a sequentibus his, quod facient Meretricem desolatam et nudam, carnes ejus comedent, et illam igne comburent, et dabunt regnum suum Bestiae. Quod per "decem cornua, quae vidisti super Bestia" significetur Verbum quoad potentiam ex Divinis Veris, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_746/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_740" target=_top>740</a>). Quod "odio habere Meretricem" sit Religiosum Catholico Romanum non sufferre, et ideo jugum Dominii papalis a se rejicere (, patet). </p>
