<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>432.“头上戴的像冠冕，仿佛是金的”表他们在自己看来像是胜利者。头上戴的仿佛金子的“冠冕”表示胜利的标志，因为从前的国王在战争中都戴着金冠冕（<a href="300.htm">300</a>节）；经上说他们看上去“像马”，也就是骑在马上预备战斗（<a href="431.htm">431</a>节），接下来又说他们有“男人的脸面”；并且他们确信他们不可能被征服。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 432</h4><p>432. And on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold. This symbolically means that they seemed to themselves to be conquerors.<p>Crowns on their heads like crowns of gold denote the insignia of victory, because kings once wore golden crowns into battle (no. <a href="300.htm">300</a>); and we are told that they looked like horses, which is to say, riding on horses, prepared for battle (no. <a href="431.htm">431</a>). For they had the faces of men, as we are told next, and they were caught up in the persuasion that they could not be overcome. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 432</h4><p>432. 'And upon their heads as it were crowns like gold' signifies that they appeared to themselves as if conquerors. By 'crowns upon their heads like gold' are signified tokens of victory, because kings in battles of old wore golden crowns (<a href="300.htm">300</a>), for it is said that they were seen 'like horses,' that is, upon horses prepared for war (<a href="431.htm">431</a>), for they had the faces of men, as it follows on; and they are so much in the persuasion that they cannot be conquered. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 432</h4><p>432. And upon their heads as it were crowns like gold, signifies that they appeared to themselves as conquerors. By "crowns on their heads like gold," are signified tokens of victory, because formerly kings wore crowns of gold in battle, (<a href="300.htm">300</a>); for it is said that they were seen "like horses," that is, on horses prepared for war, (<a href="431.htm">431</a>), for they had the faces of men, as follows; and they are in the persuasion that they cannot be conquered. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 432 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>432. Et super capitibus illarum sicut coronae similes auro, significat quod apparerent sibi sicut victores. - Per "coronas super capitibus similes auro" significantur insignia victoriae, quia reges olim in praeliis gestaverunt coronas aureas (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_432/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_300" target=_top>300</a>); nam dictum est quod visi sint "similes equis," hoc est, super equis parati ad bellum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_432/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_431" target=_top>431</a>), erant enim illis facies hominum, ut sequitur; et illi in tali persuasione sunt, quod non vinci possent. </p>
