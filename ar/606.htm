<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第606节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>606.启13:17.“除了那受印记，有了兽名，或有兽名数目的，都不得作买卖”表谁也不许通过圣言进行教导，因而也不可被授予牧职、享受大师桂冠的荣耀、戴上博士帽、被视为正统，除非他承认这教义，向对它的信和爱，或与它一致、没有矛盾的事物起誓。“买卖”表示用知识（在此是指教义方面的知识）装备自己并教导它们，如下文所述。“印记”表示承认为一个改革宗基督徒，并肯定他就是如此（<a href="605.htm">605</a>节）；“兽名”表示那教义的性质，“名”表示性质（<a href="81.htm">81</a>，<a href="122.htm">122</a>，<a href="165.htm">165</a>，<a href="584.htm">584</a>节），“兽”表示被平信徒、因而全体会众所接受的教义（<a href="567.htm">567</a>节）；由于此处经上说“或有兽名”，故所表示的是与这教义及其性质相一致的；“数目”表示事物的性质（<a href="448.htm">448</a>节）；还由于经上说“或有兽名数目的”，故所表示的是与这教义及其性质没有矛盾的。经上之所以如此说，是因为龙及其兽所表示的教义因改革宗所在的不同国家而各异；不过，教义的首要原则或头是一样的，那就是：信使人称义并得救，无需律法行为。</p><p>“买卖”表示用知识装备自己并教导它们，“货物”（merchandise）、“买卖”（trade，或贸易）、“获利”（gain）所表相同，这一点从以下经文可以证实可知：你们一切干渴的都当就近水来，没有银钱的也可以来，你们都来，买了吃；不用银钱，不用价值，也来买酒和奶。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.1.htm">55:1</a>）</p><p>你们是无价被卖的，也必无银被赎。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛52.3.htm">52:3</a>）</p><p>你靠自己的智慧聪明为自己得了财富；你靠智慧的丰富和自己的贸易增添财富。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.4.htm">28:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p>由于“推罗”表示教会对良善与真理的认知，故经上论到推罗说：</p><p>一切泛海的船只都与你交易货物；他施人拿银子作你的客商；雅完人，土巴人，米设人，他们都作你的客商，用人口（soul of man）兑换你的货物。亚兰人因货品就作你的客商；你的财富，货物，商品，经营交易的，在你倾覆的日子必都坠落于海中心。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.9.htm">27:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.27.htm">27</a>）</p><p>他施的船只都要哀号，因为推罗变为荒场，她的商家是王子，她的买卖人是地上的尊贵人。（以赛亚书1-8）</p><p>在主的比喻中，买卖所表相同：</p><p>一个人要往外国去，按着才干给他仆人银子，叫他们做买卖赚钱。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.14.htm">25:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.30.htm">30</a>）</p><p>另一个人给他仆人十弥拿去做买卖。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.12.htm">19:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.26.htm">26</a>）</p><p>人遇见藏在田里的宝贝，就把它藏起来，变卖一切所有的买这块田。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.44.htm">13:44</a>）</p><p>一个商人寻找宝贵的珍珠，遇见一颗极贵重的，就变卖一切，来买这颗珍珠。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.45.htm">13:45</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.46.htm">46</a>）</p><p>从幼年与你贸易的也都各奔各方，无人救你。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.15.htm">47:15</a>）</p><p>此外还有其它许多经文。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 606</h4><p>606. <a href="3927/revelation_13_17.htm">13:17</a> So that no one can buy or sell if he does not have the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of its name. This symbolically means that no one is allowed to teach from the Word, or consequently to be inaugurated into the priesthood, to be accorded the badge of the teaching office, to be granted the doctor's cap, and called orthodox, but one who acknowledges that doctrine and swears to a belief in it and love for it, and to such as is in conformity with it, or such as does not conflict with it.<p>To buy and to sell mean, symbolically, to acquire concepts, in this case concepts having to do with that doctrine, and to teach them, as shown below. The mark of the beast symbolizes an acknowledgment that one is a Reformed Christian, and a confession that one is such (no. <a href="605.htm">605</a>). The name of the beast symbolizes the character of the doctrine, a name symbolizing character (nos. <a href="81.htm">81</a>, <a href="122.htm">122</a>, <a href="165.htm">165</a>, <a href="584.htm">584</a>), and the beast symbolizing the doctrine accepted by the laity, thus by the general populace (no. <a href="567.htm">567</a>). Moreover, because the verse says "or the name of the beast," it symbolizes its character or such as is in conformity with it. A number symbolizes the character of a thing (no. <a href="448.htm">448</a>), and because the verse says "or the number of its name," it symbolizes the character of the doctrine or such as does not conflict with it.<p>It is stated so, because the doctrine symbolized by the dragon and its beast is not the same throughout the kingdoms in which Reformed Protestants are found, though it is the same in respect to this postulate or principal tenet of the doctrine, that faith justifies and saves apart from works of the law.</p><p>[2] That to buy and to sell mean, symbolically, to acquire concepts for oneself and to teach them, and so likewise to market, trade, and make a profit, is clear from the following passages:<p>Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat. Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money... (<a href="3927/isaiah_55_1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>)<p>You have sold yourselves for nothing; (therefore) you shall not be redeemed with money. (<a href="3927/isaiah_52_3.htm">Isaiah 52:3</a>)<p>With your wisdom and your understanding you have gained riches for yourself...; by your great wisdom in your trading you have increased your riches... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4-5</a>)<p>Since Tyre symbolized the church in respect to its concepts of goodness and truth, therefore we are told the following concerning Tyre:<p>All the ships of the sea... were... to market your merchandise... Tarshish was your trader...(in) silver... Javan, Tubal, and Meshech were your merchants. With human life... they carried on your trading... Syria was your trader... with chrysoprase... Your riches, your wares, and your merchandise..., ...those carrying on your trade..., will fall into the midst of the seas on the day of your ruin. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_27_9.htm">Ezekiel 27:9</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_12.htm">12-13</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_16.htm">16</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_27.htm">27</a>)<p>Wail, you ships of Tarshish! For (Tyre) is laid waste..., whose merchants are princes, and whose traders are the honored of the earth? (<a href="3927/isaiah_23_1.htm">Isaiah 23:1-8</a>)<p>Trading has the same meaning in the Lord's parable about a man traveling to a far country, who gave his servants talents to trade with and make a profit (<a href="3927/matthew_25_14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>). In another parable about a man who gave his servants ten minas for them to do business with (<a href="3927/luke_19_12.htm">Luke 19:12-26</a>). In the parable regarding a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid, who sold all that he had and bought the field (<a href="3927/matthew_13_44.htm">Matthew 13:44</a>). And in the one about a man seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one precious one, sold all that he had and bought it (<a href="3927/matthew_13_45.htm">Matthew 13:45-46</a>).<p>Such have they become..., your merchants from your youth; they shall wander each one from his region, not saving you. (<a href="3927/isaiah_47_15.htm">Isaiah 47:15</a>)<p>And so on elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 606</h4><p>606. [verse 17] 'And that no one can buy or sell if he does not have the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name' signifies that no one is allowed to teach out of the Word, accordingly to be inaugurated into the priesthood, honoured with a master's laurel, awarded a doctor's cap and called orthodox, unless he acknowledges that doctrine and swears to a faith and love of it, or to something that agrees with it or that does not disagree. By 'to buy and sell' is signified to furnish oneself with cognitions, here those that are of doctrine, and to teach them, concerning which [something] follows. By 'the mark' is signified acknowledgment as a Reformed Christian and confession that he is one (<a href="605.htm">605</a>). By 'the name of the beast' is signified the quality of the doctrine, by 'the name' the quality (<a href="81.htm">81</a>, <a href="122.htm">122</a>, <a href="165.htm">165</a>, <a href="584.htm">584</a>), and by 'the beast' is signified the doctrine received by the laity, thus by the general assembly (<a href="567.htm">567</a>); and because it is said 'or the name of the beast' there is signified the quality or such as agrees with it. By 'the number' is signified the quality of a thing (<a href="448.htm">448</a>), and because it is said 'or the number of his name' there is signified the quality or such as does not disagree. It is so said, because the doctrine that is signified by 'the dragon' and his 'beast' is diversified (non similis est) in the kingdoms where the Reformed are, but it is alike as to this principle or head of doctrine, THAT FAITH JUSTIFIES AND SAVES WITHOUT THE WORKS OF THE LAW.</p><p>[2] That 'to buy and sell' signifies to furnish oneself with cognitions and to teach them, in like manner 'to be a merchant,' 'to trade,' 'to make a profit,' is established from these passages:<p>Everyone thirsting, go to the waters, and he that has no silver, go, buy, and eat; go, I say, buy wine and milk without silver. <a href="3927/isaiah_55_1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>.<p>You have been sold for nothing, therefore you shall not be redeemed by silver. <a href="3927/isaiah_52_3.htm">Isaiah 52:3</a>.<p>In thy wisdom and thine intelligence thou hadst made for thyself wealth; and by the multitude of wisdom in thy trading thou hadst multiplied for thyself wealth. <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4-5</a>.<p>Since by 'Tyre' is signified the Church as to the cognitions of good and truth, therefore these things are said of Tyre:<p>All the ships of the sea were for carrying on thy trade; Tarshish was thy trader in silver; Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, these were thy merchants, with the souls of men they carried on thy trade; Syria was thy trader with chrysoprase: thy wealth, thy tradings, thy market, those carrying on thy trade, shall fail into the heart of the seas in the day of thy fall, <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_1.htm">Ezekiel 27</a> in to the end.<p>Howl, O ships of Tarshish, for Tyre has been laid waste, whose merchants are princes, and traders are the honoured of the land. <a href="3927/isaiah_23_1.htm">Isaiah 23:1-3</a>.<p>A similar thing is understood by 'trading' in the Lord's parable:<p>Of the man gone abroad, who gave his servants talents, that they might trade and make a profit. <a href="3927/matthew_25_14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>.<p>And of the other who gave his servants ten pounds (mina), that they might trade with them. <a href="3927/luke_19_12.htm">Luke 19:12-26</a>.<p>And of the treasure hidden in a field, which when a man found, he hid, and sold all and bought the field. <a href="3927/matthew_13_44.htm">Matthew 13:44</a>.<p>And of one seeking beautiful pearls, who when he had found one precious one, sold all and bought it. <a href="3927/matthew_13_45.htm">Matthew 13:45-46</a>.<p>Such thy traders became from youth, they wandered every one out of his district, not saving thee, <a href="3927/isaiah_47_15.htm">Isaiah 47:15</a>; besides more elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 606</h4><p>606. Verse 17. And that no one could buy or sell if he hath not the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name, signifies that it is not lawful for anyone to teach from the Word, nor consequently to be inaugurated into the priesthood, honored with the laurel of a mastership, invested with the doctor's cap, and called orthodox, unless he acknowledges that doctrine, and swears to the belief and the love of it, or to that which is in agreement, or to that which does not disagree with it. By buying and selling is signified to procure knowledges for one's self, here such as belong to that doctrine, and to teach them, as will appear presently. By "a mark" is signified the acknowledgment as a Reformed Christian, and confession that he is so, (<a href="605.htm">605</a>); by "the name of the beast" is signified the quality of the doctrine, by "name" the quality, (<a href="81.htm">81</a>[1-4], <a href="122.htm">122</a>, <a href="165.htm">165</a>, <a href="584.htm">584</a>), and by "the beast" is signified the doctrine received by the laity, thus by the general body, (<a href="567.htm">567</a>); and as it is said, "or the name of the beast," that which is in agreement with it and its quality is signified; by "number" is signified the quality of a thing, (<a href="448.htm">448</a>); and because it is said, "or the number of his name," that which does not disagree with it and its quality is signified. It is so said, because the doctrine which is signified by the dragon and his beast, varies in the different kingdoms in which the Reformed are; but it is the same as to this chief or head of doctrine, THAT FAITH WITHOUT THE WORKS OF THE LAW JUSTIFIES AND SAVES.</p><p>[2] That "to buy and sell" signifies to procure knowledges, and teach them, in like manner "to merchandise," "trade," and "gain" appears from the following passages:<p>Everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no silver, come ye, buy and eat; yea come, buy wine and milk without silver and without price, (<a href="3927/isaiah_55_1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>).<p>Ye have sold yourselves for nought, therefore ye shall not be redeemed by silver, (<a href="3927/isaiah_52_3.htm">Isaiah 52:3</a>).<p>With thy wisdom and with thy intelligence thou hast made for thyself wealth; and by the multitude of wisdom and by thy traffic thou hast multiplied for thyself wealth, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4-5</a>).<p>Since by "Tyre" is signified the church as to the knowledges of good and truth, therefore it is said of Tyre:<p>All the ships of the sea were for trading thy merchandise; Tarshish was thy merchant in silver; Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants, they gave thy merchandise with the soul of man. Syria was thy merchant in chrysophasus; thy wealth, thy traffic, thy merchandise, they that carry on thy merchandise, shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy fall, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_27_1.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>).<p>Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, whose merchants are princes, and whose traffickers are the honored of the earth, (<a href="3927/isaiah_23_1.htm">Isaiah 23:1-8</a>).<p>The same is meant by trading, in the Lord's parable:<p>Of the man who travelled abroad, and gave his servants talents, that they might trade with them and gain, (<a href="3927/matthew_25_14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>).<p>And of the other, who gave his servant ten pounds to trade with, (<a href="3927/luke_19_12.htm">Luke 19:12-26</a>).<p>And of the treasure hid in a field; which when a man found, he hid, and sold all that he had and bought the field, (<a href="3927/matthew_13_44.htm">Matthew 13:44</a>).<p>And of him that sought beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one precious one, sold all and bought it, (<a href="3927/matthew_13_45.htm">Matthew 13:45-46</a>).<p>Such have thy merchants been from thy youth; they wandered everyone from his quarter, none shall save thee, (<a href="3927/isaiah_47_15.htm">Isaiah 47:15</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 606 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>606. (Vers. 17.) "Et ut nemo possit emere aut vendere, si non habet characterem, aut nomen Bestiae, aut numerum nominis ejus," significat quod nemini liceat ex Verbo docere, proinde non inaugurari sacerdotio, decorari lauru magisterii, donari pileo doctoratus, et vocari Orthodoxus, nisi qui agnoscit doctrinam illam, ac jurat in fidem et amorem ejus, aut in tale quod ei conforme est, aut in tale quod non discordat. - Per "emere et vendere" significatur comparare sibi cognitiones, hic quae illius doctrinae sunt, et docere illas, de quo sequitur; per "characterem" significatur agnitio pro Christiano Reformato, et confessio quod sit (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_606/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_605" target=_top>605</a>); per "nomen Bestiae" significatur quale doctrinae, per "nomen" quale (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_606/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_81" target=_top>81</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_606/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_122" target=_top>122</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_606/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_165" target=_top>165</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_606/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_584" target=_top>584</a>), et per "Bestiam" significatur doctrina recepta a Laicis, ita a communi caetu (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_606/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_567" target=_top>567</a>); et quia dicitur "aut nomen Bestiae" significatur quale aut tale quod ei conforme est: per "numerum" significatur quale rei (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_606/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_448" target=_top>448</a>) et quia dicitur "aut numerus nominis ejus," significatur quale aut tale quod non discordat.
