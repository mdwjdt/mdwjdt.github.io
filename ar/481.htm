<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第481节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>481.“他对我说，你拿着吃尽了，便叫你肚子发苦，然而在你口中要甜如蜜”表欣然并愉快承认主是救主和救世主，但承认唯独主是天地之神，并且祂的人性就是神性却因曲解而不情愿且很困难。“拿着小书卷”表示接受关于主的教义；“吃尽了”表示承认它；“叫肚子发苦”表示由于曲解，对它的承认是不情愿和困难的，因为“发苦”表示被曲解的真理（<a href="411.htm">411</a>节）；“口中要甜如蜜”表示对它的接受一开始是欣然并愉快的。这些事现适用于“天使手中展开的小书卷”所表示的教义（<a href="469.htm">469</a>，<a href="472.htm">472</a>节），表示由于承认而欣然并愉快地接受主是救主和救世主；但承认唯独祂是天地之神，并且祂的人性是神性却因曲解而不情愿且很困难。导致这教义被视为令人不快，且难以接受的曲解尤其在于：人们不承认主与父为一，尽管祂自己如此教导；他们不承认主的人性为神性，尽管这人性就是神的儿子（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.35.htm">1:35</a>）；因此可以说，他们将神一分为三，将主一分为二；此外还有由此延伸出来的虚假，唯信就是从这些虚假流出的，然后唯信又反过来确认这些虚假。如此大的苦味和内在抵触就是由这些虚假导致的，以致他们死后甚至不能出于思想上的承认而提及“神性人”这个名（<a href="294.htm">294</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 481</h4><p>481. And he said to me, "Take and eat it; and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey." This symbolically means that accepting the doctrine from an acknowledgment that the Lord is the Savior and Redeemer is pleasing and agreeable, but acknowledging that He alone is God of heaven and earth, and that His humanity is Divine, is displeasing and vexatious, owing to their falsifications.<p>To take the little book means, symbolically, to accept the doctrine regarding the Lord. To eat it means, symbolically, to acknowledge the doctrine. To make the stomach bitter means, symbolically, that the doctrine will be displeasing and vexatious owing to falsifications; for bitterness symbolizes truth falsified (no. <a href="411.htm">411</a>). To be as sweet as honey in the mouth means, symbolically, that the initial acceptance of the doctrine is pleasing and delightful.<p>In application now to this doctrine, meant by the little book open in the hand of the angel (nos. <a href="469.htm">469</a>, <a href="472.htm">472</a>), these particulars mean, symbolically, that accepting it from an acknowledgment that the Lord is the Savior and Redeemer is pleasing and delightful, but that any acknowledgment that He only is God of heaven and earth, and that His humanity is Divine, is displeasing and vexatious owing to falsifications.<p>The falsifications which cause this doctrine to be perceived as displeasing and vexatious are chiefly these, that people do not acknowledge the Lord to be one with the Father, as He Himself nevertheless taught, and that they do not acknowledge the Lord's humanity to be Divine, which nevertheless is the Son of God (<a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">Luke 1:35</a> <sup>1</sup>). And so it may be said that they make God three and the Lord two. Added to these falsifications are the continual falsities flowing from them. From these flows faith alone, and faith alone afterward serves to confirm them.<p>From these falsities arise such a bitterness and inner repugnance that people after death cannot even pronounce the words Divine humanity from any mental acknowledgment of their meaning, as may be seen in no. <a href="294.htm">294</a> above.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"And the angel answered and said to her, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.'" </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 481</h4><p>481. 'And he said unto me, Take it and eat it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey' signifies that a reception resulting from the acknowledgment that the Lord is a Saviour and Redeemer is agreeable and pleasant, but that the acknowledgment that He Only is the God of heaven and earth and that His Human is Divine is disagreeable and difficult because of falsifications. By 'to take' the little book is signified to receive the doctrine concerning the Lord; by 'to eat it up' is signified to acknowledge it; by 'to make thy belly bitter' is signified that it is going to be disagreeable and difficult because of falsifications, for by 'bitter' is signified truth falsified (<a href="415.htm">415</a>); by being 'in the mouth sweet as honey' is signified that the first [state] of reception is agreeable and pleasant. The things now applied to that doctrine, which is understood by the little book opened in the angel's hand (<a href="469.htm">469</a>, <a href="472.htm">472</a>), signify that a reception resulting from the acknowledgment that the Lord is a Saviour and Redeemer is agreeable and delightful, but that the acknowledgment that He Only is the God of heaven and earth and that His Human is Divine is disagreeable and difficult because of falsifications. The falsifications because of which that doctrine is perceived as disagreeable and difficult are, chiefly, that the Lord has not been acknowledged to be one with the Father, as nevertheless He Himself teaches; also, that they have not acknowledged the Lord's Human to be Divine, although it is 'the Son of God' (<a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>); and thus, as it may be said, that they have made God three, and the Lord two; besides the untruths derived from these by continuity. Out of these untruths there flows faith alone, and faith alone afterwards confirms the untruths. It may be seen above (<a href="294.htm">294</a>) that so much bitterness and internal resistance results that it is not even possible after death for 'Divine Human' to be named by them out of an acknowledgment in thought. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 481</h4><p>481. And he said unto me, Take it and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey, signifies that reception from acknowledgment that the Lord is the Saviour and Redeemer, is agreeable and pleasant, but that the acknowledgment that He alone is the God of heaven and earth, and that His Human is Divine, is disagreeable and difficult to receive by reason of falsifications. By "taking the little book," is signified to receive the doctrine concerning the Lord; by "eating it up," is signified to acknowledge it; by "making the belly bitter," is signified that it will be disagreeable and difficult from falsifications, for "bitter" signifies truth falsified, (<a href="411.htm">411</a>); by "being in the mouth sweet as honey," is signified that the beginning of its reception is agreeable and pleasant. These things that are now applied to that doctrine, which is meant by "the little book open in the hand of the angel" (<a href="469.htm">469</a>, <a href="472.htm">472</a>), signify that reception from acknowledgment that the Lord is the Saviour and Redeemer, is agreeable and pleasant; but that the acknowledgment that He alone is the God of heaven and earth, and that His Human is Divine, is disagreeable and difficult from falsifications. The falsifications, by which that doctrine is perceived as disagreeable and difficult are especially that the Lord is not acknowledged to be one with the Father, although He Himself so taught; they have not acknowledged the Lord's Human to be Divine, which, nevertheless, is the Son of God, (<a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>); and thus it may be said, that they have made God three, and the Lord two; besides the falsities continued from them: from these falsities flows faith alone, and faith alone afterwards confirms those falsities. That from these falsities, so great a bitterness and internal repugnance exists, that they cannot, after death, even name the Divine Human from acknowledgment in thought, may be seen above, (<a href="294.htm">294</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 481 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>481. "Et dixit mihi, Accipe et devora illum, et amaricabit tuum ventrem sed in ore tuo erit dulcis sicut mel," significat quod receptio ex agnitione quod Dominus sit Salvator et Redemptor, sit grata et amoena, at quod agnitio quod Solus sit Deus Caeli et Terrae, et quod Humanum Ipsius sit Divinum, sit ingrata et molesta ex falsificationibus. - Per "accipere Libellum" significatur recipere Doctrinam de Domino; per "devorare illum" significatur agnoscere illam; per "amaricare ventrem" significatur quod ingrata et molesta futura sit ex falsificationibus, per "amarum" enim significatur verum falsificatum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_481/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_411" target=_top>411</a>); per "esse in ore dulcis sicut mel" significatur quod primum receptionis Sit gratum et jucundum. Haec nunc applicata ad Doctrinam illam, quae intelligitur per "Libellum apertum in manu Angeli (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_481/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_469" target=_top>469</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_481/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_472" target=_top>472</a>), significant quod receptio ex agnitione quod Dominus Sit Salvator et Redemptor, sit grata et jucunda; sed quod agnitio quod Solus sit Deus Caeli et Terrae, et quod Humanum Ipsius sit Divinum, sit ingrata et molesta ex falsificationibus. Falsificationes, ex quibus Doctrina illa percipietur ingrata et molesta, sunt praecipuae, quod Dominum non agnoverint unum cum Patre, ut tamen Ipse docuit; et quod nec agnoverint Humanum Domini Divinum, quod tamen est Filius Dei, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_481/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_1_35" target=_top>Luca 1:35</a>) et sic, ut ita dicatur, quod Deum fecerint Tres, ac Dominum Duos; praeter falsa continua ex illis: ex his falsis fluit Sola Fides, ac Sola Fides postea illa falsa confirmat. Quod ex his tanta amaritudo ac interna repugnantia existat, ut ne quidem nominari possit Divinum Humanum ex agnitione in cogitatione ab illis post mortem, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_481/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_294" target=_top>294</a>). </p>
