<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第134节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>134.“教导我的仆人，引诱他们行奸淫”表圣言的真理由此被歪曲。“教导、引诱神的仆人”表那些能够也愿意被教导圣言真理的人；处于真理的人被称为“神的仆人（或用人）”（参看<a href="3.htm">3</a>，<a href="128.htm">128</a>节）；“行奸淫”表示玷污和歪曲圣言。“行奸淫”之所以具有这样的含义，是因为圣言的每一个细节都有良善与真理的婚姻，当良善从真理被分离和夺走时，该婚姻便破裂了。圣言的每一个细节都有主与教会的婚姻，并因此有良善与真理的婚姻。这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/80.htm">80</a>-90节）一书。由此可知，“行奸淫”表示玷污良善，歪曲圣言的真理。因为这是属灵的奸淫，所以那些凭自己的理性歪曲圣言的人死后进入灵界之后，就变成行淫者。而且，世人迄今所不知的是：确认唯信，将仁爱行为排除在外的人具有子母乱伦的欲望。在灵界，他们行如此可憎淫行的欲望经常被察觉到。记住这一点，死后加以求证，你将得到确认。</p><p>以前我不敢披露，因为过于刺耳。流便与其父之妾辟拉乱伦就表示这种淫乱（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.22.htm">35:22</a>）。因为“流便”表脱离仁之信，因此缘故，他被其父以色列咒诅，后来其长子的名分也被剥夺。他的父亲以色列在为儿子们预言时，论流便说：</p><p>流便哪，我的长子，你是我的力量，是我能力的开始。但你滚沸如水，必不能居首位，因为你上了你父亲的床，污秽了它；他上了我的榻。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.3.htm">49:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.4.htm">4</a>）</p><p>于是，其长子的名分被剥夺。</p><p>以色列的长子原是流便，因他污秽了父亲的床，他长子的名分就归了约瑟的儿子。（历代志上<a href="http://39-27.cn/代上5.1.htm">5:1</a>）</p><p>“流便”代表源自良善的真理，或源自仁之信，后来代表脱离良善的真理，或脱离仁之信，这一点可见于下文的解释（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.5.htm">7:5</a>）。</p><p>“行奸淫”表示玷污圣言的良善，歪曲圣言的真理，这一点从以下经文明显可知：</p><p>约兰见耶户就说，耶户啊，平安吗？耶户说，你母亲耶洗别的淫行邪术这样多，焉能平安呢？（列王纪下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下9.22.htm">9:22</a>）</p><p>“耶洗别的淫行”不是指肉体上的淫行，而是指她的上述种种恶行（<a href="132.htm">132</a>节）。</p><p>你们的儿女必在旷野飘流四十年，担当你们淫行的罪。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民14.33.htm">14:33</a>）</p><p>我必剪除转向魔鬼和占卜者，随他们行邪淫的灵魂。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利20.6.htm">20:6</a>）</p><p>只怕你与那地的居民立约，他们随从他们的神行邪淫。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.15.htm">34:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.16.htm">16</a>）</p><p>耶路撒冷啊，你倚仗自己的美貌，又因你的名声就行邪淫；你向任何过路人倾泻出你的淫乱。你也和你邻邦身体肥大的埃及人行淫，加增你的淫乱。你与亚述人行淫，与他们行淫之后，仍不满足。你增多你的淫乱，直到迦勒底。妇人，淫妇，宁肯接外人不接丈夫。人都是把淫资送给妓女；你反倒把淫资给所有人，使他们从四围来与你行淫。你这妓女啊，要听耶和华的话。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.15.htm">16:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.28.htm">28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.29.htm">29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.32.htm">32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.33.htm">33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.35.htm">35</a>等）</p><p>在这段经文中，“耶路撒冷”是指以色列和犹太教会；她的“淫行”表对圣言的玷污和歪曲。在圣言中，“埃及”表属世人的知识，“亚述”表由此而来的推理，“迦勒底”表对真理的亵渎，“巴比伦”表对良善的亵渎，故经上说耶路撒冷与他们行淫。</p><p>有两个女子，是一母的女儿；她们在埃及行邪淫，在幼年时行邪淫；一个归我之后行邪淫，贪恋所爱的人，就是她的邻邦亚述人她就与他们放纵淫行；她没有离弃在埃及时的淫乱。另一个比她更败坏爱情，她的淫乱比她姐姐的淫乱更多。她又加增淫行，迷恋迦勒底人。巴比伦人就来登她爱情的床，以他们的淫行玷污了她。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.2.htm">23:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.7.htm">7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.16.htm">16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.17.htm">17</a>等）</p><p>此处“一母的两个女儿”同样是指以色列和犹太教会，他们对圣言的玷污和歪曲在此以上述“淫行”来描述。</p><p>又如以下经文：</p><p>你和许多情人行淫；你以淫乱和邪恶，把这地玷污了。背道的以色列所行的，你看见没有？她上各高山并行淫。奸诈的犹大也去行淫。她因淫乱的声音把这地玷污了；她和石头木头行淫。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.1.htm">3:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.8.htm">8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.9.htm">9</a>等）</p><p>你们当在耶路撒冷的街上跑来跑去，若能就寻找，看看有一人行公义、求真理没有。我使他们饱足，他们就行奸淫，成群地进入娼妓家里。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.1.htm">5:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.7.htm">7</a>）</p><p>你的奸淫、你的发嘶声、你所犯淫行的罪，在山上、在田野间，我都看见了。耶路撒冷啊，你有祸了！你不肯洁净，还要到几时呢？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.27.htm">13:27</a>）</p><p>我在耶路撒冷的先知中曾见可怕的固执，他们犯奸淫，行在虚谎中。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.14.htm">23:14</a>）</p><p>他们在以色列中行了愚昧的事，犯了奸淫，又冒我的名说虚谎话。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶29.23.htm">29:23</a>）</p><p>他们越发得罪我，我必使他们的荣耀变为羞辱；他们行淫，因为他们离弃耶和华。奸淫夺了他们的心。你们的女儿行淫，你们的儿媳犯奸淫。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.7.htm">4:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.10.htm">10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>我认识以法莲，他竟行淫了，以色列被玷污了。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何5.3.htm">5:3</a>）</p><p>在以色列家我见了可憎的事；在那里以法莲犯了奸淫；以色列被玷污。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何6.10.htm">6:10</a>）</p><p>“以色列”在此是指教会，“以法莲”是指对圣言的理解，教会就来自并取决于对圣言的理解。故经上说：“以法莲犯了奸淫；以色列被玷污”。</p><p>正因教会歪曲了圣言，所以先知何西阿被吩咐娶妓女为妻，耶和华说：</p><p>你去娶淫妇为妻，也收那从淫乱所生的儿女；因为这地大行淫乱，离弃耶和华。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何1.2.htm">1:2</a>）</p><p></p><p>你去爱一个妇人，就是她情人所爱，又是淫妇的。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何3.1.htm">3:1</a>）</p><p>由于犹大教会堕落至此，故犹太民族被主称为“一个淫乱的世代”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.39.htm">12:39</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.4.htm">16:4</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可8.38.htm">8:38</a>），在以赛亚书则被称为“奸夫的种”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛57.3.htm">57:3</a>）；在那鸿书：</p><p>祸哉！这流人血的城，充满谎诈，被刺杀的众多，都因妓女多有淫行，她用她的淫行出卖万族。（那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿3.1.htm">3:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿3.3.htm">3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿3.4.htm">4</a>）</p><p>由于在基督教界，“巴比伦”玷污、歪曲圣言比其他人更甚，所以她被称为“大淫妇”，以下启示录经文说的就是她：</p><p>巴比伦叫列族喝她邪淫、大怒的酒。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.8.htm">14:8</a>）</p><p>因为列族都喝她邪淫大怒的酒醉了，地上的君王与她行淫。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.3.htm">18:3</a>）</p><p>天使说，我将大淫妇所要受的审判指示你，地上的君王与她行淫。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.1.htm">17:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>祂审判了那用淫行败坏这地的大淫妇。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.2.htm">19:2</a>）</p><p>从这些经文明显可知，“淫乱”和“行淫”表示玷污并歪曲圣言的良善与真理。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 134</h4><p>134. "'To teach and seduce My servants to commit sexual immorality.'" This symbolically means, in consequence of which faith the truths of the church are falsified.<p>To teach and seduce the Lord's servants means, symbolically, to teach and seduce people who can be and are willing to be instructed in truths from the Word. That servants of the Lord are what people governed by truths are called may be seen in nos. <a href="3.htm">3</a> and <a href="128.htm">128</a> above; and to commit sexual immorality means, symbolically, to adulterate and falsify the Word. To commit sexual immorality has this symbolic meaning because every particular of the Word contains a marriage of good and truth, and this marriage is broken when goodness is divorced and estranged from truth.<p>To be shown that every particular of the Word contains a marriage of good and truth, see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="../ss/80.htm">80-90</a>. It is because of this that to commit sexual immorality means, symbolically, to adulterate the goods of the Word and falsify its truths. Moreover, because this is spiritual licentiousness, therefore people who have employed their own reason to falsify the Word become sexually licentious people when they enter the spiritual world after death. And something as yet unrecognized in the world is the fact that people who have affirmed faith alone to the exclusion of any works of charity are prompted by the lust of an adultery of a son with his mother. In the spiritual world I have often perceived them to be impelled by the lust of so unspeakable an adultery. Remember this and inquire into it after death, and you will be convinced. I have not dared to reveal this previously, because it offends the ears.</p><p>[2] This adultery is symbolized by the adultery of Reuben with Bilhah, his father's concubine (<a href="3927/genesis_35_22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>), inasmuch as Reuben symbolizes that faith. Therefore he was cursed by his father Israel, and the birthright was subsequently taken from him. For in prophesying concerning his sons, his father Israel said of Reuben,<p>Reuben, you are my firstborn, My might and the beginning of my strength... Unstable as water, you shall not excel, because you went up to your father's bed, then defiled it. He went up to my pallet. (<a href="3927/genesis_49_3.htm">Genesis 49:3-4</a>)<p>And therefore the birthright was taken from him:<p>...Reuben (was) the firstborn of Israel..., but because he defiled his father's pallet, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph... (<a href="3927/1-chronicles_5_1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>)<p>We will see in the explanation of <a href="3927/revelation_7_5.htm">Revelation 7:5</a> that Reuben represented truth arising from good or faith springing from charity, and afterward truth divorced from good or faith divorced from charity.</p><p>[3] That references to sexual licentiousness in the Word symbolize adulterations of good and falsifications of truth can be seen from the following passages:<p>...when Joram saw Jehu, he said, "Is it peace, Jehu?" And he said, "What peace, as long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft are many?" (<a href="3927/2-kings_9_22.htm">2 Kings 9:22</a>)<p>The harlotries of Jezebel do not mean any acts of licentiousness, but her deeds, as cited in no. <a href="132.htm">132</a> above.<p>Your sons shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms... (<a href="3927/numbers_14_33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>)<p>The person who has regard to mediums and soothsayers, to go whoring after them..., I will cut him off... (<a href="3927/leviticus_20_6.htm">Leviticus 20:6</a>)<p>(Do not) make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, (lest) they go whoring after their gods... (<a href="3927/exodus_34_15.htm">Exodus 34:15</a>).<p>(Jerusalem,) you trusted in your own beauty and played the harlot because of your fame, (so that) you poured out your harlotries on everyone passing by... You also committed harlotry with the Egyptians, your very carnal neighbors, and multiplied your acts of harlotry... You also played the harlot with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable, (with whom) you played the harlot... You multiplied your harlotry as far as... Chaldea... The adulterous woman, who in place of her husband takes strangers. All men give payment to their harlots, but you made your payments to them all, (that they may) come to you from all around for your harlotries... Therefore, harlot, hear the word of Jehovah. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_16_15.htm">Ezekiel 16:15-16</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_26.htm">26</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_28.htm">28-29</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_32.htm">32-33</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_35.htm">35</a>ff.)<p>Jerusalem there is the Israelite and Jewish Church. Its harlotries mean adulterations and falsifications of the Word. And because Egypt symbolizes the knowledge of the natural self, Assyria reasoning on the basis of it, Chaldea the profanation of truth, and Babel the profanation of good, therefore the passage says that it played the harlot with them.</p><p>[4] ...two women, the daughters of one mother, committed harlotry in Egypt; in their youth they committed harlotry... (One,) my subject, played the harlot, and she doted on her lovers, the neighboring Assyrians... She committed her harlotries with them... (Yet) she has not given up her harlotries in Egypt....<p>(The other) became more corrupt in her loving than she, and in her harlotries more corrupt than her sister's harlotries... She increased her harlotries... She loved (Chaldeans).... Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and they defiled her with their harlotry. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_23_2.htm">Ezekiel 23:2-3</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_23_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_23_7.htm">7-8</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_23_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_23_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_23_16.htm">16-17</a>ff.)<p>The two daughters of the same mother are likewise the Israelite and Jewish Church, whose adulterations and falsifications of the Word are described here, as above, by harlotries.</p><p>[5] So, too, in the following passages:<p>...you have played the harlot with many lovers... You have profaned the land with your harlotries and your wickedness... Have you seen what backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and... played the harlot... Treacherous Judah... went and played the harlot also. So that... by the report of her harlotry she defiled the land; ...she committed adultery with stone and wood. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_3_1.htm">Jeremiah 3:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_3_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_3_8.htm">8-9</a>)<p>And elsewhere:<p>Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see... if you can find a man... who executes judgment and seeks the truth... I satiated them, and they committed harlotry and came by troops into the harlots' house. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_5_1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_7.htm">7</a>)<p>I have seen your adulteries... your neighings, the wickedness of your harlotry, your abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! You will not be made clean... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_13_27.htm">Jeremiah 13:27</a>)<p>I have seen a horrible obstinacy in the prophets of Jerusalem: they commit adultery and walk in a lie. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>)<p>...they have committed folly in Israel, have committed adultery..., and have spoken (My) word in My name falsely... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_29_23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a>)<p>...they sinned against Me; I will change their glory into disrepute... They committed harlotry..., because they have forsaken Jehovah. Harlotry... enslaved (their) heart... ...your daughters commit harlotry, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery. (<a href="3927/hosea_4_7.htm">Hosea 4:7</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_4_10.htm">10-11</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_4_13.htm">13</a>)<p>I know Ephraim..., (that) he has (altogether) committed harlotry, (and) Israel is defiled. (<a href="3927/hosea_5_3.htm">Hosea 5:3</a>)<p>I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel: Ephraim committed harlotry there, (and) Israel is defiled. (<a href="3927/hosea_6_10.htm">Hosea 6:10</a>)<p>Israel there is the church, and Ephraim is its understanding of the Word, from which and in accordance with which the church is formed. Therefore Ephraim is said to have committed harlotry and Israel to be defiled.</p><p>[6] Since the church had falsified the Word, the prophet Hosea was commanded to take himself a harlot as a wife, as follows:<p>...take yourself a woman of harlotries and children of harlotries, for the land has committed great harlotry behind Jehovah. (<a href="3927/hosea_1_2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>).<p>Again:<p>...love a woman who is loved by a companion and is an adulteress... (<a href="3927/hosea_3_1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>)<p>Since the Jewish Church was such as described, therefore the Lord called the Jewish nation an adulterous generation (<a href="3927/matthew_12_39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_16_4.htm">16:4</a>, <a href="3927/mark_8_38.htm">Mark 8:38</a>); and in Isaiah, the offspring of an adulterer (<a href="3927/isaiah_57_3.htm">Isaiah 57:3</a>).<p>In Nahum:<p>Woe to the bloody city! Full of lying... The multitude of the slain... because of the multitude of the harlotries of the harlot..., who sells nations through her harlotries... (<a href="3927/nahum_3_1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>, <a href="3927/nahum_3_3.htm">3-4</a>)</p><p>[7] Since Roman Catholicism adulterates and falsifies the Word more than any others in the Christian world, it is therefore called Babylon, the Great Harlot, and the following things are said of it in the book of Revelation:<p>Babylon... has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her harlotry. (<a href="3927/revelation_14_8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>)<p>(Babylon has made) all the nations (drink) of the wine of the wrath of her harlotry, and the kings of the earth have committed harlotry with her... (<a href="3927/revelation_18_3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>)<p>(The angel said,) "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot... with whom the kings of the earth committed harlotry. (<a href="3927/revelation_17_1.htm">Revelation 17:1-2</a>)<p>...He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her harlotry. (<a href="3927/revelation_19_2.htm">Revelation 19:2</a>)<p>It is apparent from this now that to commit adultery and to commit sexual immorality mean, symbolically, to adulterate and falsify the goods and truths of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 134</h4><p>134. 'To teach and to seduce My servants to commit whoredom' signifies as a result of which the truths of the Word are falsified. By 'to teach and to seduce the Lord's servants' is understood [teaching and seducing] those who can be and want to be instructed in truths out of the Word. That they who are in truths are termed 'the Lord's servants' may be seen above (<a href="3.htm">3</a>, <a href="128.htm">128</a>). And by 'to commit whoredom' is signified to adulterate and falsify the Word. This is signified by committing whoredom because in the details of the Word there is the marriage of good and truth, and this marriage is broken up when good is separated and taken away from truth. That in the details of the Word there is the marriage of the Lord and the Church, and the resulting marriage of good and truth, may be seen in <a href="../ss/80.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 80-90</a>. This is why by 'to commit whoredom' is signified to adulterate the goods and falsify the truths of the Word; and because this is spiritual whoredom, therefore also those who by their own special method have falsified the Word are addicted to whoredom when they come into the spiritual world; and, what has till now escaped the world's notice, those who have confirmed faith alone to the complete exclusion of works of charity are in the lust of the adultery of a son with his mother. That they are in the lust of such an abominable adultery has been often perceived in the spiritual world. Remember this, and inquire after death, and you will be confirmed. I have not dared to reveal this before, because it offends the ears.</p><p>[2] This adultery is signified by the adultery of Reuben with Bilhah his father's concubine (<a href="3927/genesis_35_22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>); for by 'Reuben' that faith is signified, for which cause he was cursed by his father Israel, and afterwards the birthright was taken away from him; for his father Israel, prophesying concerning his sons, said of Reuben:<p>Reuben my firstborn, thou art my strength, and the beginning of my vigour, light as water, thou shalt not excel, because thou wentest up to thy father's bed, then thou didst profane it: he went up to my couch. <a href="3927/genesis_49_3.htm">Genesis 49:3-4</a>.<p>Therefore his birthright was taken away from him:<p>Reuben was the firstborn of Israel; but because he defiled his fathers couch, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph, <a href="3927/1-chronicles_5_1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>.<p>That by 'Reuben' was represented truth derived from good, or faith derived from charity, and afterwards truth separated from good, or faith separated from charity, will be seen in the Exposition at chapter <a href="3927/revelation_7_5.htm">7:5</a>.</p><p>[3] That by 'whoredoms' are signified adulterations of good and falsifications of truth in the Word can be established from these passages:<p>When Joram saw Jehu, he said, Is it peace, Jehu?

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 134</h4><p>134. To teach and to seduce My servants to commit whoredom, signifies, from which it comes to pass that the truths of the Word are falsified. By "to teach and to seduce the servants of the Lord," is meant those who are able and willing to be instructed in truths from the Word; that they are called "servants of the Lord" who are in truths, may be seen above, (<a href="3.htm">3</a>[1-3], <a href="128.htm">128</a>); and by "committing whoredom," is signified to adulterate and falsify the Word: that this is signified by "committing whoredom," is, because in every particular of the Word there is the marriage of good and truth, and this marriage is broken when good is separated and taken away from truth. That in every particular of the Word there is the marriage of the Lord and the church, and thence the marriage of good and truth, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, (<a href="80.htm">80-90</a>). From this it is, that "to commit whoredom" signifies to adulterate the goods and falsify the truths of the Word; and because this is spiritual whoredom, therefore also they who from their own reason have falsified the Word, after death, when they come into the spiritual world, become whoremongers: and, what has hitherto been concealed from the world, they who have confirmed themselves in faith alone to the exclusion of works of charity, are in the lust of committing the adultery of a son with his mother. That they are in the lust of committing so abominable a kind of adultery, has often been perceived in the spiritual world. Remember this, and inquire after death, and you will be confirmed.</p><p>[2] I have not ventured to reveal this before, because it offends the ears. This adultery is signified by the adultery of Reuben with Bilhah his father's concubine, (<a href="3927/genesis_35_22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>); for by "Reuben" that faith is signified, for which cause he was cursed by his father Israel, and afterwards his birthright was taken away from him; for his father Israel, prophesying concerning his sons, said of Reuben:<p>Reuben my firstborn, thou art my strength, and the beginning of my power, light as water, thou shalt not excel, because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then thou didst profane it: he went up to my couch, (<a href="3927/genesis_49_3.htm">Genesis 49:3-4</a>).<p>Therefore his birthright was taken from him.<p>Reuben was the firstborn of Israel; but because he polluted his father's couch, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph, (<a href="3927/1-chronicles_5_1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>).<p>That by "Reuben" was represented truth from good, or faith from charity, and afterwards truth separated from good, or faith separated from charity, will be seen in the explanation of chapter <a href="3927/revelation_7_5.htm">7:5</a>.</p><p>[3] That by "whoredoms" are signified adulterations of good and falsifications of truth in the Word, may appear from the following passages:<p>When Joram saw Jehu, he said, Is it peace, Jehu? Who said, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel, and her incantations are so many? (<a href="3927/2-kings_9_22.htm">2 Kings 9:22</a>).<p>By "the whoredoms of Jezebel" are not meant any whoredoms, but her deeds, of which above, (<a href="132.htm">132</a>).<p>Your sons shall be pasturing in the wilderness forty <sup>1</sup>years, and they shall bear your <sup>2</sup>whoredoms, (<a href="3927/numbers_14_33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>).<p>And I will cut off the soul that looketh back to pythons and soothsayers to go a whoring after them, (<a href="3927/leviticus_20_6.htm">Leviticus 20:6</a>).<p>Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, (<a href="3927/exodus_34_15.htm">Exodus 34:15-16</a>).<p>Jerusalem, thou didst trust in thy beauty, and didst commit whoredom on account of thy fame, even so that thou didst pour out thy whoredoms on everyone that passed by.

Thou didst commit whoredom with the sons of Assyria even when there was no satiety to thee with whom thou didst commit whoredom. Thou hast multiplied thy whoredom even to Chaldea.
