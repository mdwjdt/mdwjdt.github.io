<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>870.“死亡和阴间也交出其中的死人”表本身已沦为魔鬼和撒但、内心邪恶的教会之人被召集起来受审判。“死亡和阴间”无非表示那些本身内在已沦为魔鬼和撒但的人；“死亡”表示那些本身内在已沦为魔鬼的人，“阴间”表示那些本身内在已沦为撒但的人，因而表示所有内心邪恶的人，尽管他们外在看似教会之人；因为被召集起来接受普遍审判的，并非其他人；事实上，那些外在像教会之人，无论是平信徒，还是神职人员，内在却沦为魔鬼和撒但的人会受审判，因为在他们里面，外在要与内在分离，这种人同样能受审判，因为他们已经知道并信奉属教会的事。“死亡”表示本身已沦为魔鬼的内心邪恶之人，“阴间”（即地狱）表示那些本身已沦为撒但的人，这一点从经上说“死亡和阴间也被扔在火湖里”（｛20:14）明显可知；因为能被扔进地狱的，不是“死亡”和“阴间”，而是那些其内在是死亡和阴间或地狱的人，也就是那些本身已沦为魔鬼和撒但的人。至于魔鬼和撒但表示谁，可参看前文（<a href="97.htm">97</a>，<a href="841.htm">841</a>，<a href="857.htm">857</a>节）；那些本身沦为魔鬼的人就是死亡，如前所述（<a href="866.htm">866</a>节）。其它地方也提到“死亡和阴间”，如以下经文：</p><p>人子说，我拿着死亡和阴间的钥匙。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.18.htm">1:18</a>）</p><p>骑在灰色马上的，名字叫作死，阴府也随着他。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.8.htm">6:8</a>）</p><p>其它经文中也有提及（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何13.14.htm">13:14</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.4.htm">18:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.5.htm">5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗49.14.htm">49:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗49.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗116.3.htm">116:3</a>.）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 870</h4><p>870. And Death and Hell delivered up the dead who were in them. This symbolizes the impious at heart in the church, who in themselves were devils and satanic spirits, called together for judgment.<p>The people meant by Death and Hell are no others than people who inwardly were devils and satanic spirits - Death meaning people who inwardly were devils, and Hell people who inwardly were satanic spirits - accordingly all the impious at heart, who nevertheless in outward appearances seemed to be people of the church. For they were the only people who were called together for this universal judgment, inasmuch as only those people are judged who in outward appearances seem to be people of the church, whether laymen or clergy, but who inwardly are devils and satanic spirits. That is because in their case, their outward displays and inward realities have to be separated, and because they also can be judged, since they have known and professed the tenets of the church.<p>That Death means the impious at heart who in themselves were devils, and Hell those who in themselves were satanic spirits, is apparent from the statement in the next verse, verse <a href="3927/revelation_20_14.htm">14</a>, that Death and Hell were cast into the lake of fire, when neither death nor hell can be cast into hell. But those can be who, as regards their interiors, personify death and hell, that is to say, who in themselves are devils and satanic spirits.<p>Just who are meant by the Devil and Satan may be seen in nos. <a href="97.htm">97</a>, <a href="841.htm">841</a>, <a href="857.htm">857</a> <sup>1</sup>above; and that those are Death who in themselves are devils, in no. <a href="866.htm">866</a> above.<p>Death and hell are mentioned also elsewhere, as in the following:<p>(The Son of Man said,) "I have the keys of hell and death." (<a href="3927/revelation_1_18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>)<p>The name of him who sat on (the pale horse) was Death, and Hell followed him. (<a href="3927/revelation_6_8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>)<p>Likewise in <a href="3927/hosea_13_14.htm">Hosea 13:14</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_18_4.htm">Psalms 18:4-5</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_49_14.htm">49:14-15</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_116_3.htm">116:3</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;No. 857 is missing. Nevertheless we find three references to it, in nos. <a href="550.htm">550</a>, <a href="858.htm">858</a>, <a href="870.htm">870</a>, and because both nos. <a href="550.htm">550</a> and <a href="858.htm">858</a> include as well a reference to no. <a href="856.htm">856</a>, and no. <a href="858.htm">858</a> in the text comes immediately after <a href="856.htm">856</a>, it seems quite likely that no. 857 was omitted accidentally by the printer of the first edition. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 870</h4><p>870. 'And death and hell gave up those who were dead in them' signifies the wicked-hearted men of the Church who in themselves were devils and satans, called together to judgment. By 'death and hell' no others are understood than those who interiorly in themselves were devils and satans, by 'death' those who interiorly in themselves were devils and by 'hell' those who interiorly in themselves were satans, therefore all the wicked-hearted who yet in external things appeared as men of the Church. For no others were called together to this universal judgment; for those, whether they are of the laity or the clergy, who in external things are like men of the Church and in internal things are devils and satans are judged, because with them the external things must be separated from the internal. And also they can be judged because they have known and professed the things that are of the Church. That by 'death' are understood the wicked-hearted who in themselves were devils and by 'hell' those who in themselves were satans is plain from the fact that it is said that 'death and hell were cast into the lake of fire' (the following verse, 14), and neither death nor hell can be cast into hell, but those can be who as to their interior things are 'death and hell,' that is, in themselves devils and satans. Who are understood by 'the Devil' and 'Satan' may be seen above (<a href="97.htm">97</a>, <a href="841.htm">841</a>, <a href="857.htm">857</a>); also that those are 'death' who in themselves are devils, just above (<a href="866.htm">866</a>). Elsewhere also 'deaths and hell' is said, as:<p>The Son of Man said, I have the keys of deaths and hell. <a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>.<p>The name of him sitting on the pale horse was death and hell was following him. <a href="3927/revelation_6_13.htm">Revelation 6:13</a>; in like manner, <a href="3927/hosea_13_14.htm">Hosea 13:14</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_18_4.htm">Psalms 18:4-5</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_18_5.htm">5-6</a>]; <a href="3927/psalms_49_14.htm">Psalms 49:14-15</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_49_15.htm">15-16</a>]; <a href="3927/psalms_116_3.htm">116:3</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 870</h4><p>870. And death and hell gave up the dead which were in them, signifies the men of the church who were wicked at heart, and who in themselves were devils and satans, called together to judgment. By "death and hell" no others are meant than they who interiorly in themselves were devils and satans, by "death" they who were inwardly in themselves devils, and by "hell" they who inwardly in themselves were satans, consequently all the wicked at heart, who nevertheless in externals appeared like men of the church; for no others were called together to this universal judgment; for they who in externals are like men of the church, whether they be of the laity or clergy, and in internals are devils and satans, are judged, because in them externals are to be separated from internals, and such likewise can be judged, because they have known and professed the things which are of the church. That by "death" are meant the wicked at heart who in themselves were devils, and by "hell" they who in themselves were satans, may appear from its being said, that "death and hell were cast into the lake of fire" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_20_14.htm">14</a>); for neither death nor hell can be cast into hell, but they can who as to their interiors are death and hell, that is, who are in themselves devils and satans. Who are meant by the Devil and Satan, may be seen above, (<a href="97.htm">97</a>, <a href="841.htm">841</a>, <a href="857.htm">857</a>); and that they are death who in themselves are devils, above, (<a href="866.htm">866</a>). In other places also mention is made of "death and hell," as in the following:<p>The Son of man said, I have the keys of death and hell, (<a href="3927/revelation_1_18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>).<p>The name of him who sat on the pale horse was Death, and hell followed him, (<a href="3927/revelation_6_8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>).<p>In like manner <a href="3927/hosea_13_14.htm">Hosea 13:14</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_18_4.htm">Psalms 18:4-5</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_49_14.htm">49:14-15</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_116_3.htm">116:3</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 870 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>870. "Et Mors at Infernus dederunt eos qui in illis mortuos," significat homines Ecclesiae impios corde, qui in se diaboli et satanae erant, convocatos ad judicium. - Per "Mortem et Infernum" non alii intelliguntur, quam qui interius in se diaboli et satanae erant, per "Mortem" qui interius in se diaboli, et per "Infernum" qui interius in se satanae, proinde omnes impii corde, et tamen in externis sicut homines Ecclesiae apparebant; non enim alii ad Judicium hoc universale covocati sunt; nam qui in externis sunt sicut homines Ecclesiae, sive sint ex laicis sive ex clericis, ac in internis diaboli et satanae,judicantur, quia apud illos separanda sunt externa ab internis; et quoque judicari possunt, quia sciverunt et professi sunt illa quae Ecclesiae sunt. Quod per "Mortem" intelligantur impii corde qui in se diaboli erant, et per "Infernum" qui in se satanae, patet ex eo quod dicatur quod "Mors et Infernus conjecti sint in stagnum ignis," (vers. seq. 14); et non potest Mors, nec Infernus conjici in Infernum, sed illi possunt, qui quoad interiora sua sunt Mors et Infernus, hoc est, in se diaboli et satanae.
