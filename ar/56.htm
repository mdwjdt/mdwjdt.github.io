<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>56.“对我说，不要惧怕”表复活，然后出于深切谦卑的崇拜。这就是复活得生命，这一点从上文（<a href="55.htm">55</a>节）可推知；显然，这是出于深切谦卑的崇拜，因为他俯伏在主脚前。当他苏醒时，一种神圣的敬畏感充满他，故主说：“不要惧怕。”当来自主的生命进入，取代人自己的生命时，这种神圣的敬畏感（有时伴随心智内层的微颤，有时伴随毛发直立）便油然而生。人自己的生命是从人自己仰望主，而来自主的生命是从主仰望主，但貌似从人自己仰望主。当人处于后一种生命时，他发现自己什么也不是，眼里只有主。但以理也曾体验这种神圣的敬畏感，当时：</p><p>他看见一人身穿细麻衣，腰束乌法精金带，身体如水苍玉，面貌如闪电，眼目如火把，手臂和脚如擦亮的铜那么闪耀，一看见祂，但以理也像死了一样，有一手按在他身上，祂就说，但以理啊，不要惧怕。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.5.htm">10:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>当主变像，彼得、雅各和约翰同样如此，当时主：</p><p>脸面如日头，衣裳如光，门徒也是俯伏在地，极其害怕，然后耶稣进前来，摸他们，说，你们不要害怕。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.2.htm">17:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.6.htm">6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.7.htm">7</a>）</p><p>主还对在坟墓旁看到祂的妇女们说，不要害怕。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.10.htm">28:10</a>）</p><p>同样，面貌如同闪电，衣服如雪的天使对那些妇女说，你们不要害怕。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.3.htm">28:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p>天使也对撒迦利亚说，不要害怕。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.12.htm">1:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>一位天使以同样的方式对马利亚说，不要怕。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.30.htm">1:30</a>）</p><p>一位天使对牧羊的人说，不要惧怕。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.9.htm">2:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>西门因网到了鱼而充满这种神圣的敬畏感，于是他说：</p><p>主啊，离开我，我是个罪人。可耶稣对他说，不要怕。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路5.8.htm">5:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路5.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>此外还有其它类似经文。引用这些经文，是为让人们知道为何主对约翰说“不要惧怕”，“不要惧怕”表复活，然后出于深切谦卑的崇拜。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 56</h4><p>56. Saying to me, "Do not be afraid." This symbolizes a revival, and from the deepest humility then, adoration.<p>That it means a revival or bringing back to life follows from what we said just before this in no. <a href="55.htm">55</a>; and it is apparent that it includes an adoration from the deepest humility, since John fell at the Lord's feet. Moreover, because upon his revival a holy fear seized him, the Lord said, "Do not be afraid."<p>A holy fear is sometimes combined with a reverent trembling of the interior constituents that belong to the mind, and sometimes with a standing on end of the hair, and it comes over a person when life from the Lord enters in place of one's own life. One's own life is to look to the Lord from oneself, while life from the Lord is to look to the Lord from the Lord, and yet doing so as though of oneself. When a person is seized by this life, he sees that he is nothing, and that only the Lord is anything.<p>Daniel was seized by this holy fear when he saw a man clothed in linen garments, whose loins were girded with the gold of Uphaz, his body like beryl, his face like lightning, his eyes like torches of fire, and his arms and his feet like the sheen of burnished bronze. On seeing him Daniel, too, became as though dead, and a hand touched him, and a voice said, "Do not fear, Daniel" (<a href="3927/daniel_10_5.htm">Daniel 10:5-12</a>).<p>Something similar happened with Peter, James and John when they saw the Lord transfigured and He appeared with a face like the sun and garments like light, on which account they also fell on their faces and feared for themselves greatly, and Jesus then came and touched them, saying, "Do not be afraid for yourselves" (<a href="3927/matthew_17_2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_17_6.htm">6-7</a>).<p>The Lord also said to women who saw Him at the sepulchre, "Do not be afraid" (<a href="3927/matthew_28_10.htm">Matthew 28:10</a>) And an angel, whose countenance looked like lightning and his clothing like snow, said to the same women as well, "Do not be afraid for yourselves" (<a href="3927/matthew_28_3.htm">Matthew 28:3-5</a>)<p>An angel also said to Zacharias, "Do not be afraid" (<a href="3927/luke_1_12.htm">Luke 1:12-13</a>).<p>The same holy fear seized Simon Peter because of the catch of fish, so that he said, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!" But Jesus said to him, "Do not be afraid." (<a href="3927/luke_5_8.htm">Luke 5:8-10</a>)<p>And so on elsewhere.<p>We cite these instances to show why the Lord said to John, "Do not be afraid" - that it means a revival, and from the deepest humility then, adoration. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 56</h4><p>56. 'Saying unto me, Do not be afraid' signifies revival, and adoration then from profound humiliation. That it is revival into life, follows from the immediately preceding things (<a href="55.htm">55</a>) and that it is adoration from profound humiliation is plain, for he had fallen at the Lord's feet. And, because holy fear took possession of him when he had been revived, the Lord said, 'Do not be afraid.' Holy fear, which is sometimes conjoined with a sacred tremor of the interiors that are of the mind and sometimes with the hair standing on end, supervenes when life from the Lord enters in place of one's own life. One's own life is to look from oneself to the Lord, but life from the Lord is to look from the Lord to the Lord and yet as if from oneself. Whilst a man is in this life he sees himself as not anything, but he sees the Lord only. Daniel was in this holy fear when he saw the Man (vir) clothed in linen, whose loins had been girded with gold of Uphaz, his body like beryl, his face like lightning, his eyes like torches of fire, his arms and feet as the lustre of polished bronze, upon seeing whom Daniel became as dead, and a hand touched him, and it was said, 'Do not be afraid, Daniel' (<a href="3927/daniel_10_5.htm">Daniel 10:5-12</a>). Something similar was done to Peter, James and John when the Lord was transformed and seen in face as the sun and in garments as the light, in consequence of which they also fell upon their faces, and were sore afraid. Whereupon Jesus coming near touched them, saying 'Do not be afraid' (<a href="3927/matthew_17_6.htm">Matthew 17:6-7</a>). Also the Lord said to the women who saw him at the sepulchre, 'Do not be afraid.' And the angel also, whose face was seen as lightning, and his garment as snow, said to those women, 'Do not be afraid' (<a href="3927/matthew_28_3.htm">Matthew 28:3-5</a>). An angel also said to Zechariah, 'Do not be afraid' (<a href="3927/luke_1_12.htm">Luke 1:12-13</a>). In like manner an angel said to Mary, 'Do not be afraid' (<a href="3927/luke_1_30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>). Also an angel said to the shepherds, round about whom the glory of the Lord shone, 'Do not be afraid' (<a href="3927/luke_2_9.htm">Luke 2:9-10</a>). A like holy fear laid hold of Simon on account of the draught of fishes, and he therefore said, 'Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.' But Jesus said to him, 'Do not be afraid' (<a href="3927/luke_5_8.htm">Luke 5:8-10</a>); besides other places. These have been adduced so that it may be known why the Lord said, 'Do not be afraid' to John, and that by it revival is understood, and then adoration from profound humiliation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 56</h4><p>56. Saying unto me, Fear not, signifies resuscitation, and then adoration from the deepest humiliation. That it is resuscitation to life, is a consequence of what went before, (<a href="55.htm">55</a>); and that it is adoration from the deepest humiliation, is evident, for he fell at the Lord's feet. And as a holy fear seized him, the Lord said, on his being resuscitated, "Fear not." Holy fear, which sometimes is joined with a sacred tremor of the interiors of the mind, and sometimes with horripilation, supervenes, when life enters from the Lord in place of one's own life. One's own life is to look from one's self to the Lord, but life from the Lord is to look from the Lord to the Lord and yet as if from himself. When man is in this latter life, he sees that he himself is not anything, but the Lord only. Daniel also was in this holy fear, when:<p>He saw the man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz, his body like the beryl, his face like lightning, his eyes like torches of fire, his arms and feet as the splendor of polished brass, upon seeing whom Daniel also became as dead, and a hand touched him, and it was said, Fear not, Daniel, (<a href="3927/daniel_10_5.htm">Daniel 10:5-12</a>).<p>Something similar occurred to Peter, James, and John, when the Lord was transfigured, and was seen:<p>As to His face like the sun, and His garments as the light, upon which they also fell upon their faces, and feared for themselves greatly, and then Jesus coming near, touched them, saying, Fear not ye, (<a href="3927/matthew_17_2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_17_6.htm">6-7</a>.<p>The Lord also said unto the women who saw Him at the sepulcher, Fear not, (<a href="3927/matthew_28_10.htm">Matthew 28:10</a>).<p>Likewise the angel, whose face appeared like lightning, and his garment as snow, said unto those women, Fear not ye, (<a href="3927/matthew_28_3.htm">Matthew 28:3-5</a>).<p>The angel said to Zechariah also, Fear not, (<a href="3927/luke_1_12.htm">Luke 1:12-13</a>).<p>In like manner the angel said to Mary, Fear not, (<a href="3927/luke_1_30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>).<p>The angels said to the shepherds also, when the glory of the Lord shone round about them, Fear not, (<a href="3927/luke_2_9.htm">Luke 2:9-10</a>).<p>A similar holy fear seized Simon, by reason of the draught of fishes; therefore he said:<p>Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord; but Jesus said unto him, Fear not, (<a href="3927/luke_5_8.htm">Luke 5:8-10</a> besides other places).<p>These are adduced that it may be known why the Lord said to John, "Fear not," and that by it is meant resuscitation, and then adoration from the deepest humiliation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 56 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>56. "Dicens mihi, Ne time," significat resuscitationem, et tunc ex summa humiliatione adorationem. - Quod sit resuscitatio in vitam, a mox praecedentibus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_56/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_55" target=_top>55</a>) sequitur; et quod Sit adoratio ex Summa humiliatione, patet, nam ceciderat ad pedes Domini; et quia cum resuscitatus est, sanctus timor illum occupavit, dixit Dominus, "Ne time." Sanctus timor, qui quandoque conjunctus est cum sacro tremore interiorum quae mentis sunt, et quandoque cum horripilatione, supervenit quando vita a Domino loco vitae propriae intrat. Vita propria est spectare a Se ad Dominum; vita autem a Domino est spectare a Domino ad Dominum, et usque tanquam a Se; dum homo in hac vita est, videt se non esse aliquid, sed solum Dominum. In sancto hoc timore fuit etiam Daniel, cum vidit "Virum indutum linteis, cujus lumbi cincti erant auro Uphasi, corpus sicut tharschish, facies sicut fulgur, oculi sicut faces ignis, brachia et pedes sicut splendor aeris laevigati:" quo viso etiam Daniel factus est sicut mortuus, ac illum tetigit Manus, et dictum est, "Ne Time, Daniel," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_56/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_10_5-12" target=_top>Daniel 10:5-12</a>).<p>Simile etiam factum est cum Petro, Jacobo et Johanne, cum minus transformatus est, et visus Quoad faciem ut Sol, et quoad vestimenta ut Lux, ex quo etiam illi ceciderunt super facies, et timuerunt sibi valde; et tunc accedens Jesus tetigit illos, dicens, "Ne Timete Vobis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_56/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_17_1-27" target=_top>Matthaeus 17</a>:(<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_56/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_17_2" target=_top>2</a>,) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_56/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_17_6-7" target=_top>6-7</a>);<p>Dixit etiam Dominus ad mulieres, quae ad sepulchrum viderunt Ipsum, "Ne Timete," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_56/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_28_10" target=_top>Matthaeus 28:10</a>);<p>Et quoque Angelus, cujus facies visa est sicut fulgur, et vestis sicut nix, dixit ad mulieres illas, "Ne Timete Vobis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_56/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_28_3-5" target=_top>Matthaeus 28:3-5</a>);<p>Angelus ad Sachariam etiam dixit, "Ne Time," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_56/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_1_12-13" target=_top>Luca 1:12-13</a>) <p>Similiter Angelus ad Mariam, "Ne Time," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_56/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_1_30" target=_top>Luca 1:30</a>);<p>Angelus quoque ad pastores, quos gloria Domini circumfulsit, "Ne Timete," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_56/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_2_9-10" target=_top>Luca 2:9-10</a>).<p>Similis timor sanctus cepit Simonem propter capturam piscium; quare dixit, <p>"Exi a me, quia vir peccator sum, Domine;" sed Jesus dixit ad illum, Ne Time," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_56/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_5_8-10" target=_top>Luca 5:8-10</a>); praeter alibi. <p>Haec allata sunt, ut sciatur cur Dominus dixit ad Johannem, "Ne time," et quod per id intelligatur resuscitatio, et tunc summa humiliatione adoratio. </p>
