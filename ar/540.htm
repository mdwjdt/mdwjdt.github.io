<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>540.“七头上戴着七个冠冕”表被歪曲和亵渎的所有圣言真理。“冠冕”或宝石表示圣言的真理，尤表圣言字义上的真理，但在此表示那些被歪曲和亵渎的真理，因为只见它们戴在龙的“七头上”，而“七头”表示因被歪曲和亵渎的真理而疯狂（<a href="538.htm">538</a>节）。</p><p>“冠冕”或宝石表示圣言字义上的真理，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/43.htm">43</a>-45节）；那里说明，末端或表层中的神性真理，也就是圣言字义上的真理，由以下宝石来表示：亚伦胸牌（也就是乌陵和土明）上的十二块宝石（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.6.htm">28:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.15.htm">15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.30.htm">30</a>）；经上说推罗王所在伊甸园中的各样宝石（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.12.htm">28:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.13.htm">13</a>）；以及构成新耶路撒冷城墙根基的十二样宝石（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.17.htm">21:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.20.htm">20</a>）。“冠冕”或宝石之所以表示圣言字义上的真理，是因为圣言字义上的一切事物因圣言的灵义，从而因圣言的属灵真理所在的天堂之光而在天使面前都是透明的；在圣言中，“石头”表示末端或表层中的真理；因此“宝石”表示透明的真理。</p><p>被歪曲和亵渎的圣言真理之所以也被称为“冠冕”或宝石，是因为它们自身就明亮发光，无论谁拥有它们，就像世上的宝石无论在谁手里都会发光一样。有时我得以看见淫妇从地上刚来到灵人界时也戴有宝石，犹太人同样贩卖从天上所得来的宝石；由此明显可知，这种人身上的邪恶与虚假并不会改变圣言真理的亮光和光辉。因此，以下“冠冕”或宝石所表相同：从海中上来的那兽十角上戴着十个冠冕（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.1.htm">13:1</a>）；坐在朱红色兽上的那女人所戴的宝石（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.3.htm">17:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.5.htm">5</a>）。圣言的真理就是“冠冕”所表示的，这一点从启示录很明显地看出来：</p><p>坐在白马上的那一位头上戴着许多冠冕，祂的名字是神之道。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.12.htm">19:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.13.htm">13</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 540</h4><p>540. And seven jewels <sup>1</sup>on its heads. This symbolizes all the Word's truths falsified and profaned.<p>Jewels or precious stones symbolize the Word's truths, specifically truths in the Word's literal meaning, but here those truths falsified and profaned because the jewels were seen on the dragon's seven heads, which symbolize irrationality owing to a falsification and profanation of truths (no. <a href="538.htm">538</a>).</p><p>[2] That jewels or precious stones symbolize truths in the Word's literal meaning may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="../ss/43.htm">43-45</a>. We showed there that Divine truths in their outmost expressions, which are the truths in the Word's literal sense, were symbolized by the twelve precious stones on Aaron's breastpiece, namely, the Urim and Thummim (<a href="3927/exodus_28_6.htm">Exodus 28:6</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_28_15.htm">15-21</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_28_30.htm">30</a>), and also by the precious stones in the Garden of Eden, where the king of Tyre is said to have been (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-13</a>). And they were symbolized as well by the twelve precious stones which formed the foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem (<a href="3927/revelation_21_17.htm">Revelation 21:17-20</a>).<p>Truths in the literal meaning of the Word are symbolized by jewels or precious stones because everything in the Word's literal meaning is, in the eyes of angels, translucent in consequence of the Word's spiritual meaning, thus in consequence of the light of heaven in which the Word's spiritual truths reside. For a stone in the Word symbolizes truth in its outmost expressions, and thus a precious stone, that truth translucent.</p><p>[3] The Word's truths falsified and profaned are also called jewels because they are luminous in themselves, whoever possesses them, like jewels on earth, no matter in whose hand they are. I have occasionally been given to see adulterous women adorned with jewels on their first arrival from earth into the world of spirits, and also Jews selling jewels that they acquired from heaven. It was apparent from this that the evils and falsities in those people did not alter the radiance and sparkle of the Word's truths.<p>The ten jewels on the horns of the beast rising up out of the sea consequently have the same symbolism (<a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>), and so, too, the precious stones on the woman sitting on the scarlet beast (<a href="3927/revelation_17_3.htm">Revelation 17:3-5</a>).<p>That it is the Word's truths that jewels symbolize is clearly apparent from the statement in the book of Revelation, that on the head of Him who sat on the white horse were seen many jewels, and that His name was The Word of God (<a href="3927/revelation_19_12.htm">Revelation 19:12-13</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The word translated as "jewels" here means diadems or crowns in the original Greek and Latin, but the writer's definition of the term elsewhere make plain that he regularly and consistently interpreted it to mean jewels or gems. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 540</h4><p>540. 'And upon his heads seven diadems' signifies all the truths of the Word falsified and profaned. By the 'diadems' or precious stones are signified the truths of the Word, specifically the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, but here those truths falsified and profaned, because they were seen upon the seven heads of the dragon, by which is signified insanity resulting from truth falsified and profaned (<a href="538.htm">538</a>).</p><p>[2] That by 'diadems' or precious stones the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word are signified may be seen in <a href="../ss/43.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 43-45</a>, where it has been shown that Divine Truths in ultimates, which are the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, are signified:<p>By the twelve precious stones in Aaron's breastplate, which was the Urim and Thummim, <a href="3927/exodus_28_6.htm">Exodus 28:6</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_28_15.htm">15-21</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_28_30.htm">30</a>.<p>By the precious stones in the garden of Eden, in which the king of Tyre is said to have been. <a href="3927/ezekiel_33_12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12-13</a>.<p>Also by the twelve precious stones out of which the foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem were [formed]. <a href="3927/revelation_21_17.htm">Revelation 21:17-20</a>.<p>The reason why the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word are signified by the 'diadems' or precious stones is because all things of the sense of the letter of the Word are transparent before the angels by virtue of its spiritual sense, thus of the light of heaven in which the spiritual truths of the Word are. For a 'stone' in the Word signifies a truths its ultimates, consequently a 'precious stone' signifies that truth transparent.</p><p>[3] The reason why falsified and profaned truths of the Word are also termed 'diadems' is because they shine of themselves with whomsoever they may be, just like diadems on earth in whosesoever hand they are. At one the it was given me to see adulterous women, as they came first into the world of spirits from earth, adorned with diadems, and also Jews selling diadems which they had procured to themselves out of heaven. From this it was plain that the evils and untruths with such do not change the light and splendour of the truths of the Word. Similar things are therefore also signified by:<p>The ten diadems upon the horns of the beast coming up out of the sea. <a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>.<p>And by the precious stones upon the woman sitting upon the scarlet beast. <a href="3927/revelation_22_3.htm">Revelation 22:3-5</a>.<p>That the truths of the Word are the things signified by diadems is quite plain in the Apocalypse:<p>Many diadems were seen upon the head of the One sitting upon the white horse, Whose Name was the Word of God. <a href="3927/revelation_19_12.htm">19:12-13</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 540</h4><p>540. And upon his heads, seven diadems, signifies all the truths of the Word falsified and profaned. By "diadems" or precious stones, are signified the truths of the Word; specifically, the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, but here, those truths falsified and profaned, from their being seen "upon the seven heads of the dragon," by which is signified insanity from truths falsified and profaned, (<a href="538.htm">538</a>).</p><p>[2] That by "diadems," or precious stones, are signified the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Concerning the Sacred Scripture, (<a href="../ss/43.htm">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture 43-45</a>); where it is shown that Divine truths in ultimates, which are the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, are signified by:<p>The twelve precious stones in the breastplate of Aaron, which was the Urim and Thummim, (<a href="3927/exodus_28_6.htm">Exodus 28:6</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_28_15.htm">15-21</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_28_30.htm">30</a>).<p>And by the precious stones in the garden of Eden, in which the king of Tyre is said to have been, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-13</a>).<p>Also by the twelve precious stones, of which the foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem consisted, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_17.htm">Revelation 21:17-20</a>).<p>The truths of the sense of the letter of the Word are signified by "diadems," or precious stones, because all things of the sense of the letter of the Word are transparent before angels, from its spiritual sense, thus from the light of heaven, in which the spiritual truths of the Word are; for "a stone," in the Word, signifies truth in ultimates; hence, "a precious stone" signifies that truth transparent.</p><p>[3] The reason why the truths of the Word, when falsified and profaned, are also called "diadems," is because they shine from themselves, whether they be possessed by this person or that; in the same manner as diadems on earth, in whosesoever hand they are. It has sometimes been given me to see adulterous women, on their first coming from the earth into the world of spirits, decked with diadems; and Jews, likewise, selling diadems, which they had procured to themselves from heaven; from which it was plain, that evils and falsities, with such, do not change the light and splendor of the truths of the Word. Therefore the like is signified by:<p>The ten diadems upon the horns of the beast which came up out of the sea, (<a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>).<p>And by the precious stones on the woman who sat on the scarlet beast, (<a href="3927/revelation_17_3.htm">Revelation 17:3-5</a>).<p>That the truths of the Word are what are signified by "diadems," appears manifestly in Revelation, that:<p>There were seen upon the head of Him who sat upon the white horse, and whose name was the Word of God, many diadems, (<a href="3927/revelation_19_12.htm">Revelation 19:12-13</a>). </p>
