<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第523节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>523.“因为你执掌大权接管这国了”表新天堂和新教会，那里的人都承认祂是独一真神，无论现在还是过去。“因为你执掌大权”表示神性全能，这神性全能是祂的，并且自永恒就是祂。“接管这国了”表示天堂和教会如今都是祂的了，和以前一样；祂的“国”在此是指启示录（21-22章）中所论述的新天和新教会。启示录自始至终只论述先前的天与教会的状态及其废除，然后论述新天与新教会及其建立，其中的人将承认有一个三位一体在里面的神，这神就是主。这就是启示录自始至终所教导的；因为它教导：人子，就是主的神性人，是阿尔法和俄梅戛，是初和终，是首先的和末后的，是昔在、今在和将要来的，是全能者（<a href="522.htm">522</a>节）；最后教导：新教会，也就是新耶路撒冷，将成为羔羊的教会，也就是其神性人的教会，因而同时也是神性的教会，万物由此神性而来；这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>我们要欢喜快乐，因为羔羊婚娶的时候到了，祂的妻子也自己预备好了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.7.htm">19:7</a>）</p><p>七位天使中，有一位来对我说，你来，我要将新妇，就是羔羊的妻，指给你看；他将那圣城耶路撒冷指示我。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.9.htm">21:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>我耶稣是大卫的根和后裔，是明亮的晨星；圣灵和新妇都说，来，听见的人也该说，来。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.16.htm">22:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.17.htm">17</a>）</p><p>人子得了权柄、荣耀、国度；祂的权柄是永远的权柄，祂的国必不灭亡。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.14.htm">7:14</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 523</h4><p>523. "Because You have taken Your great power and entered Your kingdom." This symbolizes the New Heaven and New Church, where people will acknowledge the Lord alone as God, as He is and as He was.<p>Because You have taken Your great power symbolizes the Divine omnipotence that the Lord possesses, and which He has possessed from eternity. Because You have entered Your kingdom means, symbolically, that heaven and the church are now His possession, as they were before. His kingdom means here the New Heaven and New Church, as described in <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_22_1.htm">22</a>.<p>The book of Revelation from beginning to end has as its sole subject the state of the previous heaven and church and their termination, and after that the New Heaven and New Church and their establishment, in which the people will acknowledge one God having the Trinity in Him, and that the Lord is that God. This is what the book of Revelation tells us from beginning to end; for it tells us that the Son of man, who is the Lord in respect to His Divine humanity, is the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last, who is, was and is to come, the Almighty (no. <a href="522.htm">522</a>). And finally it tells us that the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, will be the Lamb's church, that is, a church belonging to the Lord's Divine humanity, thus at the same time to His Divinity from which all else springs, as is clearly apparent from the following verses:<p>Let us be glad and rejoice..., for the time for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready. (<a href="3927/revelation_19_7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>)<p>One of the seven angels... came... and said to me..., "Come, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife. And he... showed me the... city, the holy Jerusalem... (<a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">Revelation 21:9-10</a>)<p>I, Jesus... am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star. The Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" And let him who hears say, "Come!" (<a href="3927/revelation_22_16.htm">Revelation 22:16-17</a>)<p>To (the Son of man) was given dominion and glory and a kingdom... His dominion is an everlasting dominion..., and His kingdom the one which shall not perish. (<a href="3927/daniel_7_14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 523</h4><p>523. 'That Thou hast attained Thy great power, and taken over the kingdom' signifies the New Heaven and the New Church, where they acknowledge Him to be the Only God, as He is and as He, was. 'That Thou hast attained Thy great power' signifies the Divine Omnipotence, which He has, and which He had from eternity. 'That Thou hast taken over the kingdom' signifies that now heaven and the Church are His, as before. By 'His kingdom' here is understood the New Heaven and the New Church, which are treated of in chapters, <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_1.htm">22</a> of the Apocalypse. In the Apocalypse from beginning to end it treats only of the state of the former heaven and Church and of their abolition, and afterwards of the New Heaven and the New Church, and of the setting up thereof, in which the One God will be acknowledged, in Whom is the Trinity, and that that God is the Lord. The Apocalypse teaches this from beginning to end; for it teaches that the Son of Man, Who is the Lord as to the Divine Human, is the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, the First and the Last, IS, WAS, and IS TO COME, and is the Almighty (<a href="522.htm">522</a>); and lastly that the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, is going to be the Church of the Lamb, that is, of His Divine Human, thus at the same time of the Divine from which it came (Divinum a Quo), as is quite plain from these passages:<p>Let us rejoice and exult, for the time of the Lamb's wedding has come, and His wife has made herself ready. <a href="3927/revelation_19_7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>.<p>One of the seven angels came, and said unto me, Come, I will show thee the bride the Lamb's wife, and he showed me the city, holy Jerusalem. <a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">Revelation 21:9-10</a>.<p>I Jesus am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright and the morning Star; the Spirit and the bride are saying, Come, and he who hears, let him say, Come. <a href="3927/revelation_22_16.htm">Revelation 22:16-17</a>.<p>To the Son of Man has been given dominion, and glory, and the kingdom; His dominion is the dominion of an age, and His kingdom shall not perish. <a href="3927/daniel_7_14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 523</h4><p>523. Because Thou hast taken Thy great power, and hast entered into Thy kingdom, signifies the New Heaven and the New Church, where they acknowledge Him to be the only God, as He is and was. "Because Thou hast taken to Thee Thy great power" signifies the Divine omnipotence, which is His, and was His from eternity. "That Thou hast entered into Thy kingdom" signifies that heaven and the church are now His, as before; by His "kingdom" is here meant the New Heaven and New Church, treated of in Revelation (chaps. 21, 22). Revelation from beginning to end treats only of the state of the former heaven and church, and of their abolition, and afterwards of the New Heaven and New Church, and of their establishment, in which one God will be acknowledged in whom there is a Trinity, and that that God is the Lord. This Revelation teaches from beginning to end; for it teaches that the Son of man, who is the Lord as to the Divine Human, is the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last, He that is, was, and is to come, and the Almighty, (<a href="522.htm">522</a>); and, lastly, that the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, will be the church of the Lamb, that is, of His Divine Human, thus at the same time of the Divine, from whence all things are, as is plain from the following passages:<p>Let us rejoice and exult, for the time of the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife hath made herself ready, (<a href="3927/revelation_19_7.htm">Rev 19:7</a>).<p>And there came one of the seven angels, and said unto me, Come, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife; and he showed me the holy city Jerusalem, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">Rev 21:9-10</a>).<p>I Jesus am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright and morning star; the Spirit and the Bride say, Come, and let him that heareth say, Come, (<a href="3927/revelation_22_16.htm">Rev 22:16-17</a>).<p>There was given unto the Son of man, dominion and glory, and a kingdom; His dominion is the dominion of an age, and His kingdom shall not perish, (<a href="3927/daniel_7_14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>). </p>
