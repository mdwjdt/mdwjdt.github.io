<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第348节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>348.启7:4.“我听见受印的数目有十四万四千”表所有承认主为天地之神，并从祂经由圣言处于源自爱之良善的教义真理之人。出于以色列十二支派的“十四万四千”之所以表示这些人，是因为“以色列十二支派”表示由那些从主处于良善与真理，并承认主为天地之神的人所组成的教会。“144000”这个数字表示所有这些人；因为这个数字与12所表相同，它是12乘12，再乘1000的结果；无论哪个数字，自身相乘，然后乘10、100或1000，其含义都和原先的这个数字一样；因此，144000这个数字和144所表相同，而144则与12所表相同，因为12乘12就等于144；同样，每个支派受印的数目12000乘以12就是144000。数字12表示全部，并论及源于良善的真理，因为12是3乘以4的结果，而数字3表示真理的一切事物，数字4表示良善的一切事物；因此，在这种情况下，12表示源于爱之良善的真理的一切事物。</p><p>所有数字都表示决定其质或量的事物的属性，这一点从启示录中的数字明显看出来，它们若没有某种具体含义，在许多地方是毫无意义的。由此可见，“受印的十四万四千”，以及“各支派中受印的一万二千”不是指以色列支派中有如此多的人被盖印和拣选，而是指所有从主处于源自爱之良善的教义真理之人。这就是 “以色列的十二支派”，以及“主的十二使徒”总体上所表示的；但具体来说，每个支派和每位使徒都表示某种源于良善的真理。稍后解释每个特定支派的含义。十二支派因表示所有从主源于爱之良善的教义真理，故也表示教会的全部事物；鉴于此，以色列十二支派代表教会，十二使徒也是。</p><p>“十二”因论及教会的真理和良善，故表示主的新教会的新耶路撒冷在每个细节上都以数字十二来描述。如：</p><p>城的长和宽都是一万二千斯他丢；城墙共有一百四十四肘。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.16.htm">21:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.17.htm">17</a>）</p><p>144就是12乘12。</p><p>有十二个门；门是十二颗珍珠；门上有十二位天使；又写着以色列十二个支派的名字；城墙有十二根基；根基上有羔羊十二使徒的名字；它们由十二样宝石构成；而且，那里有生命树，十二个月结十二样的果子（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.12.htm">21:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.13.htm">13</a>；｛22章）。</p><p>关于所有这些细节，可参看启示录21和22章。主通过这些人已形成新天堂，并正在形成新教会；因为他们和14章所提到的那些人是一样的，在那里，经上论到他们说：</p><p>我又观看，见羔羊站在锡安山，同祂又有十四万四千人；、他们在宝座前唱新歌，除了从地上买来的那十四万四千人以外，没有人能学这歌；他们是童身，羔羊无论往哪里去，他们都跟随祂。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.1.htm">14:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.4.htm">4</a>）。</p><p>因为“十二支派”表示主的教会的一切真理和良善，所以数字“十二”就成了教会的数字，被应用于教会的神圣典礼和仪式中。如：含有乌陵和土明的决断胸牌有十二样的宝石（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.21.htm">28:21</a>）；十二个陈设饼被摆列在会幕的桌子上（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利24.5.htm">24:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利24.6.htm">6</a>）；摩西在西乃山下筑了一座坛并立了十二根柱子（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.4.htm">24:4</a>）；十二个人被派去窥探迦南地（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申1.23.htm">1:23</a>）；十二个人从约旦河中间取出十二块石头（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书4.1.htm">4:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书4.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书4.20.htm">20</a>）；献坛礼时，十二位首领取十二个银盘子，十二个银碗，十二个金盂，十二只公牛，十二只公羊，十二只羊羔，十二只公山羊（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.84.htm">7:84</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.87.htm">87</a>）；以利亚取了十二块石头，筑了一座坛（列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上18.31.htm">18:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上18.32.htm">32</a>）；以利亚遇见以利沙时，以利沙正赶着十二对牛耕地，他自己赶着第十二对，以利亚便把自己的外衣搭在他身上（列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上19.19.htm">19:19</a>）；所罗门在铜海下安放十二头铜牛（列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上7.25.htm">7:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上7.44.htm">44</a>）；他造了一个宝座，有十二个狮子站在台阶上（列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上10.19.htm">10:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上10.20.htm">20</a>）；身披日头的妇人头戴十二颗星的冠冕（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.1.htm">12:1</a>）。综上所述，明显可知，“受印的十四万四千，每个支派的一万二千”不是指数量上如此多的犹太人和以色列人，而是指所有属于新基督天堂和新教会，将从主经由圣言处于源自爱之良善的教义真理之人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 348</h4><p>348. And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand. (<a href="3927/revelation_7_4.htm">7:4</a>) This symbolizes all people who acknowledge the Lord as God of heaven and earth and are governed by truths of doctrine springing from the goodness of love, received from Him through the Word.<p>These are symbolized by the number 144,000 from the twelve tribes of Israel because the twelve tribes of Israel symbolize a church that consists of people who possess goodness and truth from the Lord and acknowledge Him as God of heaven and earth. The number 144,000 means all such. For that number has the same symbolism as the number twelve, since it is the product of twelve times twelve, which is then multiplied by 1000; and any number multiplied by itself and then by 10, 100, or 1000, has the same symbolism as the original number. Thus the number 144,000 has the same symbolism as 144, and this the same symbolism as twelve, as 144 is the product of twelve times twelve. Similarly, the product of the 12,000 sealed from each tribe times twelve is 144,000.<p>The number twelve means, symbolically, all, and is predicated of truths springing from goodness, because twelve is the product of three times four, and the number three symbolizes everything connected with truth, and the number four, everything connected with good. Thus the number twelve here symbolizes everything connected with truth that springs from the goodness of love.</p><p>[2] Numbers all symbolize additional properties of things that determine their quality or quantity, and this can be clearly seen from numbers in the book of Revelation, which in many places would not have any meaning unless they were symbolic.<p>From the foregoing it can now be seen that the 144,000 sealed, and the 12,000 from each tribe, mean not that these many were sealed or chosen from the tribes of Israel, but that all those were who are governed by truths of doctrine springing from the goodness of love received from the Lord.<p>This is the general symbolism of the twelve tribes of Israel, and also of the Lord's twelve apostles, but each tribe and each apostle individually symbolizes some truth springing from good. What each tribe symbolizes here, however, we will say in the following considerations.<p>Since the twelve tribes symbolize all doctrinal truths springing from the goodness of love received from the Lord, therefore they also symbolize all constituents of the church. Consequently the church was represented by the twelve tribes of Israel, and likewise by the twelve apostles.</p><p>[3] Because the number twelve is predicated of the church's truths and goods, therefore the New Jerusalem, meaning the Lord's New Church, is described in its individual parts by the number twelve. So for instance, the city had a length and breadth of 12,000 stadia. <sup>1</sup>Its wall was 144 cubits <sup>2</sup>(144 being twelve times twelve). It had twelve gates, and the gates consisted of twelve pearls. Over the gates were twelve angels, and on the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. It had twelve foundations, and on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. These consisted also of twelve precious stones. Moreover, the city had in it the tree of life which bore twelve fruits, in correlation with the twelve months. All of this may be seen in Revelation, chapters 21, 22.<p>Out of the kind of people described here the Lord formed a new heaven and is in the process of forming a new church. For they are the same people mentioned in chapter fourteen and thereafter, where we read about them the following:<p>Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand... And they sang... a new song before the throne...; and no one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth. ...they are virgins..., (and) follow the Lamb wherever He goes. (<a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_14_3.htm">3-4</a>)</p><p>[4] Since the twelve tribes symbolize the Lord's church in respect to all its truths and goods, therefore the number twelve became an ecclesiastical number, and one customary in its sanctities. So for example, on the breastpiece of judgment, containing the Urim and Thummim, there were twelve precious stones (<a href="3927/exodus_28_21.htm">Exodus 28:21</a>). Twelve cakes of showbread were placed on the table in the Tabernacle (<a href="3927/leviticus_24_5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-6</a>). Moses built an altar at the foot of Mournt Sinai and set up twelve pillars. (Exodus 24bb4) Twelve men were sent to explore the land of Canaan (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_1_23.htm">Deuteronomy 1:23</a>). Twelve men carried twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan (<a href="3927/joshua_4_1.htm">Joshua 4:1-9</a>, <a href="3927/joshua_4_20.htm">20</a>). At the dedication of the altar, twelve leaders brought twelve silver plates, twelve silver bowls, twelve gold censers, twelve young bulls, twelve rams, twelve lambs, and twelve goats (<a href="3927/numbers_7_84.htm">Numbers 7:84</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_7_87.htm">87</a>). Elijah took twelve stones and built an altar (<a href="3927/1-kings_18_31.htm">1 Kings 18:31</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_18_32.htm">32</a>). Elijah found Elisha when Elisha was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was the twelfth, and Elijah then threw his mantle over him (<a href="3927/1-kings_19_19.htm">1 Kings 19:19</a>). Solomon placed under the bronze sea twelve oxen (<a href="3927/1-kings_7_25.htm">1 Kings 7:25</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_7_44.htm">44</a>). He made a throne, and standing on its steps twelve lions (<a href="3927/1-kings_10_19.htm">1 Kings 10:19</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_10_20.htm">20</a>). On the head of the woman clothed with the sun was a crown of twelve stars (<a href="3927/revelation_12_1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>).<p>It can now be seen from this that 144,000 sealed, 12,000 from each tribe, means not this number of Jews and Israelites, but all who, as part of the new Christian heaven and of the New Church, will be governed by truths of doctrine springing from the goodness of love, received from the Lord through the Word.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Plural of stadium, an ancient Greek measure of distance equal to about 607 feet or 185 meters.<br><br>2.&nbsp;An ancient unit of linear measure based on the length of a man's forearm from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow, equivalent to approximately 18 inches or 46 centimeters. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 348</h4><p>348. [verse 4] 'And I heard the number of them that were sealed (signatorum) a hundred and forty-four thousand' signifies all who acknowledge the Lord as being the God of heaven and earth, and are in truths of doctrine out of the good of love from Him by means of the Word. These are signified by the 144000 out of the twelve tribes of Israel, because by the 12 tribes of Israel is signified the Church [formed] out of those who are in good and truth from the Lord, and who acknowledge Him as being the God of heaven and earth. By the number '144000' all these are understood; for a similar thing is signified by that number as by 'twelve,' since it arises from the multiplication of 12 by 12, and then from its multiplication by 100 and by 1000. And any number whatever multiplied by itself, and then by 10100, or 1000, signifies a similar thing to the number it is derived from. Thus 144000 is similar to 144, and this is similar to 12, because 12 times 12 makes the number 144. In like manner the 12000 sealed out of each tribe, multiplied by 12 makes 144000. The number 12 signifies all things, and is predicated of truths derived from good, because 12 arises by the multiplication of 3-4 by each other, and the number 3 signifies all as to truth, and the number 4 all as to good. Consequently 12 here signifies all as to truth derived from the good of love.</p><p>[2] That all numbers signify adjuncts of things, determining their quality or quantity, can be manifestly established from the numbers in the Apocalypse, which would not make any sense in many places unless they were significant. Resulting from the things now said it can be seen that by the '144000 sealed' and by the '12000 out of each tribe' is understood, not that so many out of the tribes of Israel were sealed and chosen, but that all those who are in truths of doctrine out of the good of love from the Lord were. This in general is signified by the 12 tribes of Israel, and also by the 12 apostles of the Lord; but some specific truth derived from good is signified by each individual tribe, and by each individual apostle. What is signified here by each individual tribe will be stated in the things following. Since the 12 tribes signify all the truths of doctrine out of the good of love from the Lord, therefore they also signify all things of the Church; on which account the 12 tribes of Israel used to represent the Church, and the 12 apostles likewise.</p><p>[3] Because the 12 are said of the truths and goods of the Church, therefore the New Jerusalem, by which the Lord's New Church is understood, is described in all its details (in singulis) by 12; as that:<p>The city in length and breadth was 12000 stadia; that the wall thereof was 144 cubits<p>The 144, 12 times 12.<p>That there were 12 gates; and the gates were of 12 pearls<p>That over the gates were 12 angels; and the names of the 12 tribes of Israel written<p>That there were 12 foundations of the wall; and in them the names of the 12 apostles of the Lamb; and the foundations were established out of 12 precious stones<p>Again, that the tree of life was there, producing 12 fruits according to the 12 months.<p>Concerning all of which, chapters <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_22_1.htm">22</a> may be seen. Out of these who are treated of here, the New Heaven has been formed and the New Church is being formed by the Lord; for they are the same who are mentioned in chapter <a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">14</a> seq., where these things [are said] about them:<p>And I saw and behold the Lamb standing upon mount Zion, and with Him the 144,000; and they were singing a new song before the throne, and no one could learn the song, but the 144,000 bought from the land; they are virgins, and they follow the Lamb wherever He goes (verse 1, 3-4).</p><p>[4] Since the 12 tribes used to signify the Lord's Church as to all the truths and goods thereof, therefore the number 12 became the number for the Church, and of common usage in the rites thereof, so that:<p>In the breastplate of judgment, where were the Urim and Thummim, there were 12 precious stones, <a href="3927/exodus_28_21.htm">Exodus 28:21</a>.<p>12 loaves of faces were put upon the table in the tabernacle. <a href="3927/leviticus_24_5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-6</a>.<p>Moses built an altar below Mount Sinai, and set up 12 pillars, <a href="3927/exodus_24_4.htm">Exodus 24:4</a>.<p>12 men were sent to search out the land of Canaan. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_1_23.htm">Deuteronomy 1:23</a>.<p>12 men carried 12 stones out of the midst of the Jordan, <a href="3927/joshua_4_1.htm">Joshua 4:1-9</a>, <a href="3927/joshua_4_20.htm">20</a>.<p>12 princes at the dedication of the altar brought 12 silver dishes, 12 silver bowls, 12 gold censers, 12 young bullocks, 12 rams, 12 lambs and 12 he-goats. <a href="3927/numbers_7_84.htm">Numbers 7:84</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_7_87.htm">87</a>.<p>Elijah took up 12 stones and built an altar, <a href="3927/1-kings_18_31.htm">1 Kings 18:31-32</a>.<p>Elijah found Elisha, when he was ploughing with 12 yoke [of oxen], and himself among the twelve, and that then he cast his mantle upon him, <a href="3927/1-kings_19_19.htm">1 Kings 19:19</a>.<p>Solomon placed 12 oxen under the bronze sea, <a href="3927/1-kings_7_25.htm">1 Kings 7:25</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_7_44.htm">44</a>.<p>He made a throne, and 12 lions standing at the steps thereof, <a href="3927/1-kings_10_19.htm">1 Kings 10:19-20</a>.<p>Upon the head of the woman encompassed with the sun was a crown of 12 stars. <a href="3927/revelation_12_1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>.<p>From these things it can now be established that by the 144000 sealed, 52000 out of each individual tribe, are understood, not so many in number of Jews and Israelites, but all of the Christian New Heaven and the New Church, who will be in truths of doctrine out of the good of love from the Lord by means of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 348</h4><p>348. Verse 4. And I heard the number of them which were sealed, a hundred and forty and four thousand, signifies all who acknowledge the Lord to be the God of heaven and earth, and are in truths of doctrine from the good of love from Him through the Word. That these are signified by "a hundred and forty and four thousand out of the twelve tribes of Israel," is, because "the twelve tribes of Israel" signify the church from those who are in good and truth from the Lord, and acknowledge Him as the God of heaven and earth. By the number "one hundred and forty-four thousand," all these are meant; for by this number the same is signified as by twelve, since it arises by multiplying "twelve" into "twelve," and then by multiplying it by "one hundred" and by "one thousand;" and any number whatever multiplied into itself, and then by "ten," "one hundred," or "one thousand," has a like signification as the original number; therefore the number "one hundred and forty-four thousand" signifies the same as "one hundred and forty-four," and this the same as "twelve," because "twelve" multiplied by "twelve" make "one hundred and forty-four;" so likewise "the twelve thousand sealed out of each tribe," being multiplied by "twelve," make "one hundred and forty-four thousand." The number "twelve" signifies all, and is predicated of truths from good, because "twelve" is the product of "three" and "four" multiplied by each other, and the number "three" signifies everything as to truth, and the number "four" everything as to good; hence "twelve," in this instance, signifies everything as to truth from the good of love.</p><p>[2] That all numbers signify the adjuncts of things, determining their quality or quantity, may appear manifest from numbers in Revelation, which, were they without some specific signification, would yield no sense whatever in many places. From what has been said it may be seen, that by "one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed," and by "twelve thousand out of each tribe," is not to be understood that so many were sealed and elected out of the tribes of Israel, but all who are in the truths of doctrine from the good of love from the Lord. This is what is signified in general by "the twelve tribes of Israel," and also by "the Lord's twelve apostles;" but, in particular, some truth from good is signified by each tribe, and by each apostle. But the signification of each particular tribe shall be explained presently. Since the twelve tribes signify all the truths of doctrine from the good of love from the Lord, they also signify all things of the church; on which account the twelve tribes of Israel represented the church, as did also the twelve apostles.</p><p>[3] As "twelve" is predicated of the truths and goods of the church, therefore the New Jerusalem, by which is meant the Lord's New Church, is described by the number twelve in every particular, as that:<p>The length and breath of the city was twelve thousand furlongs; that the wall thereof was one hundred and forty-four cubits, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>).<p>One hundred and forty-four is twelve multiplied by twelve.<p>That there were twelve gates; and the gates were of twelve pearls; that over the gates there were twelve angels; and the names written of the twelve tribes of Israel; that the wall had twelve foundations; and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb; and they consisted of twelve precious stones; as also that the tree of life was there, bearing twelve fruits according to the twelve months. (Rev . 12-13, 21).<p>Concerning all these particulars, see chapters 21, 22. From such as are here treated of the New Heaven is formed, and the New Church is forming by the Lord; for they are the same who are mentioned in chapter 14, where it is written of them:<p>And I saw, and, behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand. And they sung a new song before the throne, and no one could learn that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth, for they are virgins, and follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth, (<a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_14_3.htm">3-4</a>).</p><p>[4] Because "the twelve tribes" signify the Lord's church as to all its truths and goods, therefore the number "twelve" became a number of the church, and was used in its holy ceremonies and solemnities, as:<p>In the breastplate of judgment, in which were the Urim and Thummim, there were twelve precious stones, (<a href="3927/exodus_28_21.htm">Exodus 28:21</a>).<p>That twelve loaves of faces were put upon the table in the tabernacle, (<a href="3927/leviticus_24_5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-6</a>).<p>That Moses built an altar below Mount Sinai, and erected twelve pillars, (<a href="3927/exodus_24_4.htm">Exodus 24:4</a>).<p>That twelve men were sent to explore the land of Canaan, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_1_23.htm">Deuteronomy 1:23</a>).<p>That twelve men brought twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, (<a href="3927/joshua_4_1.htm">Joshua 4:1-9</a>, <a href="3927/joshua_4_20.htm">20</a>).<p>That twelve princes at the dedication of the altar brought twelve chargers of silver, twelve bowls of silver, twelve censers of gold, twelve oxen, twelve rams, twelve lambs, and twelve he-goats, (<a href="3927/numbers_7_84.htm">Numbers 7:84</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_7_87.htm">87</a>).<p>That Elijah took twelve stones, and built an altar, (<a href="3927/1-kings_18_31.htm">1 Kings 18:31-32</a>).<p>That Elijah found Elisha ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen, and himself among the twelve, and that then he cast his mantle upon him, (<a href="3927/1-kings_19_19.htm">1 Kings 19:19</a>).<p>That Solomon placed twelve oxen under the brazen sea, (<a href="3927/1-kings_7_25.htm">1 Kings 7:25</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_7_44.htm">44</a>).<p>That he made a throne, and twelve lions standing at the steps of it, (<a href="3927/1-kings_10_19.htm">1 Kings 10:19-20</a>).<p>That on the head of the woman who was clothed with the sun there was a crown of twelve stars, (<a href="3927/revelation_12_1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>).<p>From what has been said it may now be evident, that by "one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed, twelve thousand out of each tribe," are not meant so many in number of the Jews and Israelites, but all who are of the New Christian Heaven, and the New Church, who will be in truths of doctrine from the good of love through the word from the Lord. </p>

"Et audivi numerum signatorum centum quadraginta quatuor millia," significat omnes qui Dominum pro Deo Caeli et Terrae agnoscunt, et in veris doctrinae ex bono amoris ab Ipso per Verbum sunt. - Quod illi per "centum quadraginta quatuor millia ex duodecim Tribubus (filiorum) Israelis" significentur, est quia per "duodecim Tribus (filiorum) Israelis" significatur Ecclesia ex illis qui in bono et vero a Domino sunt, et Ipsum pro Deo Caeli et Terrae agnoscunt; per numerum "centum quadraginta quatuor millia" intelliguntur omnes illi; simile enim per illum numerum significatur quod per duodecim, quoniam exsurgit ex multiplicatione "12" in "12," et dein ex multiplicatione per "100" et per "1000;" et numerus quicunque multiplicatus in se, et dein per "10" "100," aut "1000," simile significat cum numero ex quo; ita numerus "144,000" simile cum "144," et hic simile cum "12," quia "12" in "12" faciunt numerum "144;" similiter "12,000" "signati ex unaquavis tribu," in "12," faciunt "144,000." Quod numerus "duodecim" significet omnia, et praedicetur de veris ex bono, est quia "12" exsurgunt per multiplicationem "3" et "4" in se, et numerus "3", significat omne quoad verum, et numerus "4" omne quoad bonum; inde hic "12," omne quoad verum ex bono amoris. Quod omnes numeri significent adjunctiva rerum, determinantia quale aut quantum illarum, manifeste constare potest ex numeris in Apocalypsi, qui nisi significarent, in multis locis ibi non foret aliquis sensus. Ex nunc dictis videri potest, quod per "centum quadraginta quatuor millia signatos," et per "duodecim millia ex unaquavis Tribu," non intelligatur quod tot ex Tribubus Israelis signati ac electi sint, sed quod omnes qui in veris doctrinae ex bono amoris a Domino sunt. Hoc in genere significatur per "duodecim Tribus Israelis," et quoque per "duodecim Apostolos Domini;" in specie autem aliquod verum ex bono per unamquamvis Tribum, et per unumquemvis Apostolum: quid autem per unamquamvis Tribum hic significatur, dicetur in sequentibus. Quoniam duodecim Tribus significant omnia vera doctrinae ex bono amoris a Domino, ideo etiam significant omnia Ecclesiae; quare duodecim Tribus Israelis repraesentabant Ecclesiam, et similiter duodecim Apostoli. Quia "duodecim" dicuntur de veris et bonis Ecclesiae, ideo Nova Hierosolyma, per quam intelligitur Nova Ecclesia Domini, in singulis describitur per "duodecim;" ut quod Urbs longitudine et latitudine esset duodecim millia stadiorum: quod Murus ejus esset centum quadraginta quatuor. cubitorum; <p>"centum quadraginta quatuor" sunt "12" in "12:" <p>quod essent duodecim Portae; et Portae ex duodecim Margaritis: quod super Portis duodecim Angeli: et nomina scripta duodecim Tribuum Israelis: quod essent duodecim Fundamenta muri; et in iis nomina duodecim Apostolorum Agni: et illa constarent ex duodecim Lapidibus pretiosis: tum, quod ibi esset Arbor vitae faciens duodecim fructus, juxta duodecim Menses (de quibus omnibus videantur cap.: <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_1-27" target=_top>21</a> et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_22_1-21" target=_top>22</a>).<p>Ex his de quibus hic agitur, formatum est Novum Caelum, et formatur Nova Ecclesia a Domino; sunt enim iidem qui memorantur capite <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_14_1-20" target=_top>14</a>, seq., ubi haec de illis: <p>"Et vidi et ecce Agnus stans super Monte Sion, et cum Ipso centum quadraginta quatuor millia; et canebant Canticum Novum coram Throno, et nemo potuit discere Canticum quam illi centum quadraginta quatuor millia empti de terra; Virgines sunt, et sequuntur Agnum quocunque vadit," (vers. 1, 3, 4).<p>Quoniam "duodecim Tribus" significabant Ecclesiam Domini quoad omnia vera et bona ejus, ideo numerus "12" factus est numerus Ecclesiae, et solennis in sanctitatibus ejus, ut Quod in Pectorali Judicii, ubi Urim et Thummim, essent duodecim lapides pretiosi, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_28_21" target=_top>Exodus 28:21</a>);<p>Quod duodecim panes facierum ponerentur super Mensa in Tabernaculo, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_24_5-6" target=_top>Leviticus 24:5-6</a>);<p>Quod Moses aedificaverit altare infra Montem Sinai, et erexerit duodecim statuas, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_24_4" target=_top>Exodus 24:4</a>);<p>Quod duodecim viri missi sint ad explorandum terram Canaanem, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_1_23" target=_top>Deuteronomius 1:23</a>);<p>Quod duodecim viri exportaverint duodecim lapides e medio Jordanis, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joshua_4_1-9" target=_top>Josua 4:1-9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joshua_4_20" target=_top>20</a>);<p>Quod duodecim Principes ad initiationem Altaris attulerint duodecim scutulas argenti, duodecim crateres argenti, duodecim acerras auri, duodecim juvencos, duodecim arietes, duodecim agnos, et duodecim hircos, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_7_84" target=_top>Numeri 7:84</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_7_87" target=_top>87</a>);<p>Quod Elias sumpserit duodecim lapides, et struxerit altare, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_1-kings_18_31-32" target=_top>1 Regnum 18:31-32</a>);
