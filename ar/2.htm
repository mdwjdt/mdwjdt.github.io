<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第2节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>2.“耶稣基督的启示”表主的预言，论及主自己及其教会，即该教会末了的境况及其以后的境况，以及它在天上和地上的境况。“耶稣基督的启示”表一切预言，因为这些预言来自主，故经上说“耶稣基督的启示”。至于它们论及主及其教会，这从下面的解释明显可知。启示录并未论述这个教会的相继状态，更未论述各国的相继状态，如某些人至今所认为的。它从头至尾都在论述教会在天上和地上的最后状态，然后论及最后审判，之后论及新教会，也就是新耶路撒冷。显然，这个新教会才是本书的目的，所以之前的那些事论及教会的状态，也就是刚刚之前它的性质。它论述这些问题的顺序从各章内容可以看出来，从各节的解释看得更清楚。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 2</h4><p>2. The Revelation of Jesus Christ. (<a href="3927/revelation_1_1.htm">1:1</a>) This symbolizes predictions from the Lord regarding Himself and His church, what the church will be like at its end, and what it will be like thereafter, both in heaven and on the earth.<p>"The Revelation of Jesus Christ" symbolizes all predictions, which, being from the Lord, are called "the Revelation of Jesus Christ." Their being about the Lord and His church will be apparent from the exposition.<p>The book of Revelation does not have as its subject the successive states of the church, still less the successive states of kingdoms, as some people have previously believed. Rather, from beginning to end it has as its subject the last state of the church in heaven and on earth, and the Last Judgment, and after that the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem.<p>It is apparent that this New Church is the final object of this work. Consequently the things that precede have to do with what the state of the church will be immediately before it. But the order in which these are described may be seen from the contents of the individual chapters, and more clearly from the exposition of each verse. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 2</h4><p>2. [verse 1] 'The Revelation of Jesus Christ' signifies predictions by the Lord concerning Himself and concerning His Church, what this will be like at its end, and what it is going to be like afterwards, in the heavens as well as on earth (in terris). By 'the Revelation of Jesus Christ' are signified all the predictions, and because these are from the Lord, it is said, 'the Revelation of Jesus Christ.' That they are concerning the Lord and concerning His Church will be plain from the expositions. In the Apocalypse it does not treat of the successive states of the Church, still less of the successive states of kingdoms, as some have believed until now; but there from beginning to end it treats of the last state of the Church in the heavens and on earth (in terris), and then of the last judgment, and after this of the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem. That this New Church is the final purpose of this work is clear. The things therefore that precede treat of what the state of the Church is like immediately beforehand. But in what series it treats of those matters can be seen from the contents of each of the chapters, and more distinctly from the exposition of each of the verses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 2</h4><p>2. Verse 1. The revelation of Jesus Christ, signifies predictions from the Lord concerning Himself and His church, what the latter will be in its end, and what it will be afterwards, as well in the heavens as upon earth. By "the revelation of Jesus Christ" are signified all predictions, which because they are from the Lord, are called the Revelation of Jesus Christ; that they relate to the Lord and His church, will appear from the explanations. In Revelation it does not treat of the successive states of the church, still less of the successive states of kingdoms, as some have hitherto believed, but there from beginning to end it treats of the last state of the church in the heavens and on the earth; and then concerning the Last Judgment; and after this of the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem. That this New Church is the end of this work, is evident, wherefore those things which precede refer to the state of the church, as to its quality just before it. But in what series these are treated of, may be seen from the contents of each chapter; and more distinctly from the explanation of each particular verse. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 2 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>2. (Vers. 1.) "Revelatio Jesu Christi," significat praedictiones a Domino de Ipso deque Ipsius Ecclesia, qualis haec erit in fine suo, et qualis postea futura est, tam in Caelis quam in Terris. - Per "Revelationem Jesu Christi," significantur omnes praedictiones, quae quia sunt a Domino, dicitur Revelatio Jesu Christi; quod sint de Domino deque Ipsius Ecclesia, ab Explicationibus patebit. In Apocalypsi non agitur de successivis statibus Ecclesiae, minus de successivis statibus Regnorum, ut quidam hactenus crediderunt, sed ibi a principio ad finem agitur de ultimo statu Ecclesiae in Caelis et in Terris, et tunc de ultimo Judicio, et post hoc de Nova Ecclesia, quae est Nova Hierosolyma: quod Nova haec Ecclesia sit finis hujus operis, patet; quare illa quae praecedunt, agunt de Ecclesiae statu, qualis est proxime ante illam; sed in quanam serie de illis agitur, videri potest a Contentis singulorum Capitum, et distinctius ab Explicatione singulorum Versuum. </p>
