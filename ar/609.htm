<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第609节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>609.“因为这是人的数目”表圣言、因而教会的性质。“人”表示智慧和聪明（<a href="243.htm">243</a>节），在此表示来自圣言的智慧和聪明，因而也表示在教会之人里面的圣言的智慧和聪明。教会本身在主面前显为一个人；因此，教会之人就其灵而言，在天上照着他里面来自主的教会性质而显为一个人。所以，这就是此处“人的数目”所表示的，因为它紧接着“凡有聪明的，可以算计兽的数目”这句话而来，这句话表示凡处于来自主的启示之人都能知道关于神和救恩的教义和信仰的确认在神职人员当中性质到底如何。来自圣言的教会性质也以“人”来表示（<a href="910.htm">910</a>节，以及其它地方）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 609</h4><p>609. For it is the number of a man. This means, symbolically, the character of the Word and so of the church.<p>A human being symbolizes wisdom and intelligence (no. <a href="243.htm">243</a>), in this case wisdom and intelligence gained from the Word, thus also the Word in relation to the wisdom and intelligence in a person in the church. The church itself also appears as a person in the Lord's sight. Therefore in respect to his spirit a person in the church appears in heaven as human in accordance with the character of the church in him gained from the Word. This is consequently the symbolic meaning of the number of a man, because it follows after the statement, "Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast," which symbolically means that one who is enlightened by the Lord can discern the character of the arguments the clergy use from the Word in defense of their doctrine and faith regarding God and salvation.<p>The character of the church gained from the Word is also symbolically meant by a man in no. 910, and also elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 609</h4><p>609. 'For it is the number of a man' signifies the quality of the Word and consequently of the Church. By 'a man' is signified wisdom and intelligence (<a href="243.htm">243</a>). Here the wisdom and intelligence out of the Word; thus also the Word as to the wisdom and intelligence with a man of the Church. The Church itself also appears before the Lord as a man; consequently a man of the Church as to his spirit in heaven appears as a man in accordance with the quality of the Church out of the Word with him. This, therefore, is what is here signified by the 'number of a man,' because it follows after the words, 'Let one having intelligence compute the number of the beast,' by which is signified that he who is in enlightenment from the Lord is able to recognise what the confirmation of the doctrine and faith concerning God and salvation is like with the clergy. The quality of the Church out of the Word is also signified by 'a man' (<a href="910.htm">910</a>, and elsewhere also). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 609</h4><p>609. For it is the number of a man, signifies the quality of the Word and thence of the church. By "man" is signified wisdom and intelligence, (<a href="243.htm">243</a>), here wisdom and intelligence from the Word; thus also the Word as to the wisdom and intelligence in the man of the church. The church itself likewise appears before the Lord as a man; hence a man of the church, as to his spirit, appears in heaven as a man according to the quality of the church from the Word in him. This therefore it is which is signified here by "the number of a man," because it follows after these words, "Let him that hath intelligence count the number of the beast," by which is signified that he who is in enlightenment from the Lord may know what the quality of the confirmations of the doctrine and faith concerning God and salvation among the clergy really is. The quality of the church from the Word is also signified by "man" (<a href="920.htm">920</a>, and also in other places). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 609 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>609. "Numerus enim hominis est," significat quale Verbi et inde Ecclesiae. - Per "hominem" significatur sapientia et intelligentia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_609/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_243" target=_top>243</a>), hic sapientia et intelligentia ex Verbo; ita quoque Verbum quoad sapientiam et intelligentiam apud hominem Ecclesiae. Ipsa etiam Ecclesia apparet coram Domino ut homo; inde homo Ecclesiae quoad spiritum suum in Caelo apparet ut homo secundum quale Ecclesiae ex Verbo apud illum: hoc itaque est, quod hic significatur per "numerum hominis," quia sequitur post haec, "habens intelligentiam computet numerum Bestiae;" per quae significatur, quod qui in illustratione est a Domino cognoscere possit quale confirmationum doctrinae et fidei de Deo et Salvatione est apud Clericos: quale Ecclesiae ex Verbo etiam significatur per "hominem (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_609/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_920" target=_top>920</a>, et quoque alibi). </p>
