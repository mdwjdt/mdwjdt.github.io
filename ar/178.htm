<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第178节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>178.“因你略有一点力量”表因他们知道凭自己什么也做不了。通过主处于源自良善的真理之人知道，他们凭自己没有对抗邪恶与虚假、因而对抗地狱的任何能力；他们还知道，他们无法凭自己出于任何能力去行善，并将自己引入天堂，一切能力都是主的，因而通过主在他们里面；他们在何等程度上处于源自良善的真理，就在何等程度上处于来自主的能力，而这能力在他们看来如同自己的。这就是“因你略有一点力量”所表示的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 178</h4><p>178. "'For you have little strength.'" This symbolically means, because they know they have no power of themselves.<p>People who are governed by truths springing from goodness derived from the Lord know that of themselves they do not have any power against evils and falsities, thus against hell. Moreover, they also know that they cannot from any power of their own do good or introduce themselves into heaven, but that all power is the Lord's, and thus that they have it from the Lord, and this to the extent that they are governed by truths springing from goodness, a power that nevertheless appears to them as their own.<p>This, then, is what is meant by the statement, "For you have little strength." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 178</h4><p>178. 'Because thou hast a little power' signifies because they know that of themselves they are powerless. Those who are in truths derived out of good from the Lord know that they do not have any power of themselves against evils and untruths, thus against hell. And they know also that they are not able to do good derived from any power of themselves, or to introduce themselves into heaven, but that the Lord has all the power, and so they have it from the Lord, and in so far as they are in truths derived from good, so far they are in the power from the Lord, which yet appears to them as their own. These, therefore, are the things understood by 'because thou hast a little power. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 178</h4><p>178. Because thou hast a little power, signifies because they know that they can do nothing from themselves. They who are in truths from good from the Lord, know that they have not any power against evils and falsities, thus against hell, from themselves, and they also know that they cannot, out of any power from themselves, do good and introduce themselves into heaven, but that all power is the Lord's, and thus is in them from the Lord, and in proportion as they are in truths from good, in the same proportion they are in power from the Lord, which yet appears to them as their own. This then is what is meant by "For thou hast a little power." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 178 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>178. "Quia parvam habes potentiam," significat quia sciunt quod nihil valeant ex se ipsis. - Qui in veris ex bono sunt a Domino, sciunt quod illis non aliqua potentia sit contra mala et falsa, ita contra Infernum, ex se; et quoque sciunt, quod non ex aliqua potentia ex se possint facere bonum, ac semet introducere in Caelum, sed quod omnis potentia sit Domino, et sic illis a Domino, et quantum in veris ex bono sunt, tantum in potentia sint a Domino, quae usque eis apparet ut sua; haec itaque sunt, quae intelliguntur per "quia habes parvam potentiam." </p>
