<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第358节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>358.启7:7.“以萨迦支派中受印的有一万二千”表那些将要属于主的新天堂和新教会之人所具有的生活良善。在至高意义上，“以萨迦”表示真理的神性良善和良善的真理；在属灵意义上，表示属天的婚姻之爱，也就是对良善与真理的爱；在属世意义上，表示奖赏；但此处“以萨迦”表示生活的良善，因为他在这组中排行第三，无论在哪一组，第三个都表示由前面两个所产生的终端，如同出于原因的结果；以及出于“西缅”所表示的属灵之爱，就是对邻之爱的结果通过“利未”所表示的对真理的情感产生生活的良善，也就是“以萨迦”。 “以萨迦”的确因“价值”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.17.htm">30:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.18.htm">18</a>）、从而因“奖赏”得名，生活的良善就拥有奖赏在里面。在摩西对他的祝福中，“以萨迦”也表示此类事物：</p><p>西布伦哪，你出外可以欢喜。以萨迦啊，在你帐棚里可以快乐。他们要召集万民到山上，在那里献公义的祭，因为他们要吸取海里的丰富，并沙中所藏的珍宝。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.18.htm">33:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.19.htm">19</a>）</p><p>不过，在他父亲以色列对他的祝福中（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.14.htm">49:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.15.htm">15</a>），“以萨迦”则表示寻求功德的生活良善。这一点可见于伦敦出版的《天堂的奥秘》（<a href="../ac/6388.htm">6388</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 358</h4><p>358. Of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand were sealed. This symbolizes goodness of life in those people who will be part of the New Heaven and of the Lord's New Church.<p>In the highest sense Issachar symbolizes the Divine good of truth and truth of good; in the spiritual sense, the conjugal love of heaven, which is one of goodness and truth; and in the natural sense, recompense. Here, however, it is goodness of life, because in this group Issachar is the third in order, and the third element in every group symbolizes the final one, which is the product of the first two, as an effect is of its causes. And the effect produced by spiritual love, which is love for the neighbor and symbolized by Simeon, operating through an affection for truth, which is symbolized by Levi, is goodness of life, which is Issachar. The name Issachar also comes from a word meaning payment (<a href="3927/genesis_30_17.htm">Genesis 30:17-18</a>), thus recompense; and goodness of life has in it its own recompense.<p>Something of the kind is symbolized by Issachar, too, in Moses' blessing of him:<p>Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and Issachar in your tents! They shall call peoples to the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness; for they shall suck the affluence of the sea and the hidden objects of the sand. (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_18.htm">Deuteronomy 33:18-19</a>)<p>In his father Israel's blessing of him (<a href="3927/genesis_49_14.htm">Genesis 49:14-15</a>), however, Issachar symbolizes a merit-seeking goodness of life. See Arcana Coelestia (The Secrets of Heaven) <a href="../ac/6388.htm">6388</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 358</h4><p>358. 'Out of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand sealed' signifies the good of life with those who will belong to the New Heaven and the Lord's New Church.<p>By 'Issachar' is signified in the highest sense the Divine Good of Truth and Truth of Good, in the spiritual sense the heavenly conjugial love that is of good and truth, and in the natural sense reward, Here, however, [it is] the good of life, because in this division it is the third in order, and the third in any division signifies the ultimate that is produced out of the previous two, as an effect out of its causes; and the effect out of the spiritual love that is love towards the neighbour, and is signified by 'Simeon,' through the affection of truth, which is signified by 'Levi,' produces the good of life that is 'Issachar.' He was indeed named from 'hire' (<a href="3927/genesis_30_17.htm">Genesis 30:17-18</a>), thus from 'reward,' and the good of life has reward in itself, Some such thing is also signified by 'Issachar' in his blessing by Moses:<p>Rejoice, Zebulon, in thy going out, Issachar, in thy tents. They shall call the people unto the mountain, there they shall sacrifice the sacrifices of justice, because they shall suck the abundance of the sea, and the covered things of the hidden things of the sand. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_18.htm">Deuteronomy 33:18-19</a>.<p>However, by 'Issachar' in his blessing by the father Israel (<a href="3927/genesis_49_14.htm">Genesis 49:14-15</a>) a merit-seeking good of life is signified, as may be seen in ARCANA CAELESTIA published at London (<a href="../ac/6388.htm">Arcana Coelestia 6388</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 358</h4><p>358. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand, signifies the good of life with those who will be of the Lord's New Heaven and New Church. By "Issachar" is signified, in the highest sense, the Divine good of truth, and the truth of good; in the spiritual sense, celestial conjugial love, which is the love of good and truth; and, in the natural sense, remuneration; but here the good of life, because in this class it is the third in order, and the third in any class signifies the ultimate, which is produced from the two former, as the effect from its causes; and the effect from spiritual love, which is love towards the neighbor, and is signified by Simeon, through the affection of truth, which is signified by Levi, produces the good of life, which is "Issachar." He was also named from "hire" (<a href="3927/genesis_30_17.htm">Genesis 30:17-18</a>), thus from remuneration, and the good of life has remuneration in itself. Something of this sort is also signified by Issachar in his blessing by Moses:<p>Be glad Zebulon in thy going out, and Issachar in thy tents. They shall call the people unto the mountain; there shall they sacrifice the sacrifices of justice, for they shall suck the abundance of the sea, and the hidden things concealed in the sand, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_18.htm">Deuteronomy 33:18-19</a>).<p>But by "Issachar," in his blessing by his father Israel, (<a href="3927/genesis_49_14.htm">Genesis 49:14-15</a>) is signified meritorious good of life, as may be seen in The Arcana Coelestia, published at London, (<a href="../ac/6388.htm">6388</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 358 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>358. "Ex tribu Isascharis duodecim millia signati," significat Bonum vitae, apud illos qui e Novo Caelo et e Nova Ecclesia Domini erunt. - Per "Isascharem" significatur in Sensu supremo Divinum Bonum Veri et Verum Boni, in Sensu spirituali Amor conjugialis caelestis qui est boni et veri, et in Sensu naturali Remuneratio hic autem Bonum vitae, quia in hac classe in ordine est tertius, ac tertius in qualibet classe significat ultimum, quod producitur ex duobus prioribus, ut effectus ex suis causis; et effectus ex Amore spirituali, qui est Amor erga proximum, et significatur per Simeonem, per Affectionem veri, quae significatur per Levim, producit Bonum vitae, quod est "Isaschar:" nominatus etiam est ex Mercede, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_358/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_30_17-18" target=_top>Genesis 30:17-18</a>), ita ex Remuneratione, et Bonum vitae in se Remunerationem habet. Aliquid tale etiam per Isascharem significatur in Benedictione ejus a Mose: <p>"Laetare Sebulon in exitu tuo, Isaschar in tentoriis tuis, populos in montem vocabunt, ibi sacrificabunt sacrificia justitiae, quia affluentiam maris sugent, et obtecta occultorum arenae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_358/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_33_18-19" target=_top>Deuteronomius 33:18-19</a>).<p>Per "Isascharem" autem in benedictione ejus a Patre Israele, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_358/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_49_14-15" target=_top>Genesis 49:14-15</a>), significatur Bonum vitae meritorium, videatur in Arcanis Caelestibus Londini editis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_358/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6388" target=_top>6388</a>). <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;6388 pro "5688" </p>
