<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第258节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>258.“我又看见一位大力的天使大声宣传”表由主从内流入天使和世人思维的神性真理，以及审查。在灵义上，宣传的“天使”表示主，因为天使宣传和教导，不是凭自己，而是凭主，但仍貌似凭他自己。经上之所以说“大力的天使”，是因为他具有能力，凭能力所宣传的，会从内流入思维。“大声”表示来自主的带有能力或活力的神性真理，还表示审查，因为如下文所述，天使问：“有谁配展开那书卷呢？”</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 258</h4><p>258. Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice. (<a href="3927/revelation_5_2.htm">5:2</a>) This symbolizes Divine truth flowing in from the Lord deeply into the thought of angels and people, and investigation.<p>In the spiritual sense an angel proclaiming means the Lord, because an angel does not proclaim and instruct on his own, but from the Lord, even though he does so as though on his own. The angel is called a strong angel because he acts with power, and something proclaimed with power flows deeply into the thought. A loud voice symbolizes Divine truth from the Lord with power or force.<p>Investigation is symbolically meant as well, because the angel asks, "Who is worthy to open the book?" which follows next. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 258</h4><p>258. [verse 2] 'And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice' signifies Divine Truth from the Lord inflowing inwardly into the thought of angels and men, and investigation. By 'an angel proclaiming' the Lord is understood in the spiritual sense, because an angel does not proclaim and teach from himself but from the Lord, but still as if from himself. 'Strong angel' is said because it is with power, and what is proclaimed with power inflows inwardly into the thought. 'A great voice' signifies Divine Truth from the Lord in power or vigour. It also signifies investigation, because he asks, 'Who is worthy to open the book?,' as now follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 258</h4><p>258. Verse 2. (<a href="3927/revelation_5_2.htm">Revelation 5:2</a>) And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, signifies the Divine truth from the Lord flowing in deeply into the thought of angels and men, and investigation. By "an angel" proclaiming, is meant in the spiritual sense, the Lord, because an angel does not proclaim and teach from himself but from the Lord, but still as from himself. It is said "a strong angel," because with power, and that which is proclaimed with power flows in deeply into the thought. "A great voice" signifies the Divine truth from the Lord in power or virtue. It also signifies investigation, because he asks, "Who is worthy to open the book?" as now follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 258 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>258. (Vers. 2.) "Et vidi Angelum fortem praedicantem voce magna," significat Divinum Verum a Domino influens penitus in cogitationem angelorum et hominum, ac indagationem. - Per "Angelum" praedicantem in Sensu spirituali intelligitur Dominus, quia angelus a se non praedicat et docet, sed a Domino, at usque sicut a se: "Angelus fortis" dicitur, quia cum potentia, et quod praedicatur cum potentia, hoc influit penitus in cogitationem; "vox magna" significat Divinum Verum a Domino in potentia seu virtute: quod etiam significetur indagatio, est quia interrogat, "Quis est dignus aperire librum," ut nunc sequitur. </p>
