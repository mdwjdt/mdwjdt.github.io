<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第385节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>385.“神也必从他们眼上擦去一切的眼泪”表他们必不再处于与邪恶及其虚假的争战，由此不再处于悲痛，而是从主处于良善与真理，因此处于天上的喜乐。羔羊“也必从他们眼上擦去一切的眼泪”之所以表示这些事，是因为前面（14节）经上说，“这些人是从大苦难中出来的”，以此表示他们就是那些经历过试探，与邪恶争战过（<a href="377.htm">377</a>节）；并且以后不再陷入与邪恶的争战之人，正是这些人处于良善与真理，因此处于天上的喜乐。以下经文具有同样的含义，以赛亚书：</p><p>祂要吞灭死亡，直到永远；主耶和华必擦去众人脸上的眼泪。到那日，他们要说，看哪，这是我们的神，我们素来等候祂，祂必拯救我们；这是耶和华，我们素来等候祂，我们必因祂的救恩欢喜快乐。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛25.8.htm">25:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛25.9.htm">9</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 385</h4><p>385. "And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes." This symbolically means that they will be caught up no longer in battles against evils and the accompanying falsities, and so will no longer experience times of distress, but will be surrounded by goods and truths and thus by heavenly joys emanating from the Lord.<p>This is the symbolic meaning of the Lamb's wiping away every tear from their eyes because we are told in verse <a href="3927/revelation_7_14.htm">14</a> above that they are "ones who are coming out of the great tribulation," which means, symbolically, that they are people who have undergone temptations or trials, and have fought against evils (no. <a href="377.htm">377</a>). And people who after that are not caught up in battles against evils are people surrounded by goods and truths and thus by heavenly joys.<p>The following passage in Isaiah has a similar symbolic meaning:<p>He will swallow up death forever, and the Lord Jehovih will wipe away tears from all faces... Then they will say in that day: "Behold, this is our God; we have waited for Him, to set us free. This is Jehovah, for whom we have waited; we will rejoice and be glad in His salvation." (<a href="3927/isaiah_25_8.htm">Isaiah 25:8-9</a>)<p>---------- </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 385</h4><p>385. 'And God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes' signifies that they shall not any more be in fights against evils and the untruths thereof, and so shall not be in sorrows, but in goods and truths, and thereby in heavenly joys from the Lord. These things are signified by its being said that the Lamb 'shall wipe away every tear from their eyes' because above in verse 14 it is said that 'they are those who are coming out of great affliction,' by which is signified that they are those who had been in temptations and had fought against evils (<a href="377.htm">377</a>); and those who afterwards are not in fights against evils are in goods and truths and thereby in heavenly joys. Similar things are signified by these [words] in Isaiah:<p>He will swallow up death for ever, and the Lord Jehovih shall wipe away a tear from off all faces: then shall they say in that day, Behold, this is our God, for Whom we have waited that He might deliver us, this is Jehovah for Whom we have waited, we will exult and be glad in His Salvation. <a href="3927/isaiah_25_8.htm">Isaiah 25:8-9</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 385</h4><p>385. And God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes, signifies that they shall no longer be in combats against evils and their falsities, and thus not in grief, but in goods and truths, and thence in celestial joys from the Lord. That these things are signified by the Lamb "wiping away every tear from their eyes," is, because above (in verse 14), it is said, that "these are they which come out of great affliction," by which is signified that they are those who have been in temptations, and have fought against evils, (<a href="377.htm">377</a>); and who afterwards are not in combats against evils, the same are in goods and truths, and thence in celestial joys. The following passage in Isaiah has a similar signification:<p>He will swallow up death forever, and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces. Then they shall say in that day, Behold this is our God, whom we have waited for that He might deliver us; This is Jehovah, whom we have waited for, we will exult and be glad in His salvation, (<a href="3927/isaiah_25_8.htm">Isaiah 25:8-9</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 385 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>385. "Et absterget Deus omnem lachrymam ad oculis eorum," significat quod non amplius in pugnis contra mala et eorum falsa, et sic non in doloribus, erunt, sed in bonis et veris, et inde in gaudiis caelestibus a Domino. -Quod haec significentur per quod Agnus "absterget omnem lachrymam ex oculis eorum," est quia supra (in versu 14) dicitur, quod "sint qui veniunt ex afflictione magna," per quod significatur, quod sint qui in tentationibus fuerunt, et pugnarunt contra mala (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_385/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_377" target=_top>377</a>); et qui postea non in pugnis contra mala sunt, illi in bonis et veris, et inde in gaudiis caelestibus sunt. Similia significantur per haec apud Esajam: <p>"Absorbebit mortem in aeternum et absterget Dominus Jehovih Lachrymam desuper omnibus faciebus: tunc dicent in die illo, Ecce Deus noster Hic, Quem exspectavimus, ut liberet nos, Hic Jehovah Quem exspectavimus; exultemus et laetemur in Salute Ipsius," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_385/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_25_8-9" target=_top>25:8-9</a>). </p>
