<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第469节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>469.启10:2.“他手里拿着小书卷，是展开的”表圣言中的这一教义要点：主是天地之神，祂的人性是神性。羔羊从那坐宝座的那里所取并揭开七印的这个“书卷”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.1.htm">5:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.7.htm">7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.1.htm">6:1</a>）表示圣言（参看<a href="256.htm">256</a>，<a href="259.htm">259</a>，<a href="295.htm">295</a>节等）。因此，天使，也就是主（<a href="465.htm">465</a>节）手中的“小书卷”在此无非表示圣言中的某种本质。这种本质就是圣言中的教义要点，即主是天地之神，祂的人性就是神性，这一点从本章和下一章的所有细节的灵义，以及下一章（11:15-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.17.htm">17</a>）的属世之义明显看出来。</p><p>经上说这“小书卷”是“展开的”，因为该教义明显出现在圣言中，并且对凡阅读它并留意的人来说，也是显而易见的。这就是现在所论述的主题，因为这是新教会的最为本质之处。原因在于，每个人的救赎都取决于对神的认识和承认；正如序言中所说：“整个天堂和地上的整个教会，以及总体上一切宗教信仰都建立在对神的正确观念上；因为凭正确的神观才会有结合，凭结合才会有光、智慧和永恒的幸福。”</p><p>由于主是天地真神，所以凡不承认祂的，都不可进入天堂，因为天堂是祂的身体；而站在下面的人则被蛇，也就是恶灵咬，他们的咬伤无法治愈，除非像以色列人那样通过仰望“铜蛇”获得医治（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.1.htm">21:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.9.htm">9</a>）；“铜蛇”表示主的神性人，这从约翰福音中的下列经文明显看出来：</p><p>摩西在旷野怎样举蛇，人子也必照样被举起来；叫一切信祂的，不至灭亡，反得永生。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.14.htm">3:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.16.htm">16</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 469</h4><p>469. He had in his hand a little book open. (<a href="3927/revelation_10_2.htm">10:2</a>) This symbolizes the Word in respect to this point of doctrine there, that the Lord is God of heaven and earth, and that His humanity is Divine.<p>It may be seen in nos. <a href="256.htm">256</a>, <a href="259.htm">259</a>, and <a href="295.htm">295</a>ff. above that the book which the Lamb took from Him who sat on the throne, the seals of which the Lamb loosed (<a href="3927/revelation_5_1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_5_7.htm">7</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_6_1.htm">6:1</a>ff.), means the Word. Consequently the little book in the hand of the angel, who also is the Lord (no. <a href="465.htm">465</a>), means nothing else here than the Word in respect to some essential in it; and it is apparent from the particulars in this and the following chapter in the spiritual sense, and also from the natural sense in chapter <a href="3927/revelation_11_1.htm">11</a>, verses <a href="3927/revelation_11_15.htm">15-17</a>, that the essential is this point of doctrine in the Word, that the Lord is God of heaven and earth, and that His humanity is Divine.</p><p>[2] The little book is said to be open because this point of doctrine is plainly evident in the Word and is apparent to anyone who reads it, if he pays attention.<p>This is the subject now because it is the essential doctrine of the New Church. That is because everyone's salvation depends on a conception and acknowledgment of God. For the case is as stated in the Preface, that "heaven in its entirety is founded on a right idea of God, and so, too, the entire church on earth, and all religion in general," inasmuch as "that idea leads to conjunction, and through conjunction to light, wisdom, and eternal happiness."</p><p>[3] Now because the Lord is the one God of heaven and earth, therefore no one is admitted into heaven if he does not acknowledge Him, for heaven is the Lord's body. Instead the person remains below and is bitten by serpents, that is, by hellish spirits, from whose bite there is no cure but the one the children of Israel obtained by their looking at the bronze serpent (<a href="3927/numbers_21_1.htm">Numbers 21:1-9</a>). That the bronze serpent means the Lord in respect to His Divine humanity is apparent from the following verses in John,<p>As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. (<a href="3927/john_3_14.htm">John 3:14-15</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 469</h4><p>469. [verse 2] 'And he had in his hand a little book opened' signifies the Word as to this point of the doctrine there, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that His Human is Divine. That by 'the book' which the Lamb took from the One sitting upon the throne, and of which He loosened the seven seals (<a href="3927/revelation_5_1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_5_7.htm">7</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_6_1.htm">6:1</a>), is understood the Word may be seen above (<a href="256.htm">256</a>, <a href="259.htm">259</a>, <a href="295.htm">295</a> seq).; and therefore by the 'little book' in the hand of the angel, who is also the Lord (<a href="465.htm">465</a>), nothing else is here understood but the Word as to some essential there. That this is the point of doctrine in the Word, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth and that His Human is Divine, is plain from the details in this chapter and the following one in the spiritual sense, and also from the natural sense of the next chapter (<a href="3927/revelation_11_15.htm">11:15-17</a>).</p><p>[2] The little book is said to be 'opened' because that [point of doctrine] comes into existence manifestly in the Word, and is plain to any one who reads it if he pays attention. It treats of this now because this is the very essential of the New Church. This is because the salvation of any one depends upon the recognition and acknowledgment of God, for it is a fact, as is said in the PREFACE, that 'upon a just idea of God the entire heaven is founded, and on earth the entire Church, and in general every religion, since by means of that idea there is a conjunction, and through the conjunction light, wisdom and eternal happiness.</p><p>[3] Now because the Lord is Himself the God of heaven and earth, therefore unless He Himself is acknowledged no one is admitted into heaven, for heaven is His body; but he stands below and is bitten by serpents, that is, by infernal spirits, from whose bites there is no healing except what the sons of Israel had, as they were looking towards the serpent of bronze (<a href="3927/numbers_21_1.htm">Numbers 21:1-9</a>). That the Lord as to the Divine Human is understood by this is plain from these [words] in John:<p>As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in Him may not perish, but may have eternal life. <a href="3927/john_3_14.htm">John 3:14-15</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 469</h4><p>469. Verse 2. And he had in his hand a little book open, signifies the Word as to this point of doctrine therein, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that His Human is Divine. That by "the book" which the Lamb took from Him that sat on the throne, and of which he loosed the seven seals, (<a href="3927/revelation_5_1.htm">5:1</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_5_7.htm">7</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_6_1.htm">6:1</a>) is meant the Word, may be seen above, (<a href="256.htm">256</a>, <a href="259.htm">259</a>, <a href="295.htm">295</a>, and following). Therefore by "the little book" in the hand of the angel, who also is the Lord, (<a href="465.htm">465</a>), nothing else is here meant but the Word as to some essential therein. That this is the doctrinal point in the Word, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that His Human is Divine is evident from the spiritual sense of all the particulars in this and the following chapter, and also from the natural sense of the next chapter, (<a href="3927/revelation_11_15.htm">11:15-17</a>).</p><p>[2] "The little book" is said "to be open" because that doctrine appears manifestly in the Word, and is evident to everyone who reads it, if he attends. This is the subject now treated of, because it is the very essential of the New Church. The reason is, because on the knowledge and acknowledgment of God depends the salvation of everyone; for, as was observed in the Preface, "The whole heaven, and the whole church on earth, and, in general, all religion, is founded on a just idea of God; because by it there is conjunction, and by conjunction light, wisdom, and eternal happiness."</p><p>[3] Since the Lord is the very God of heaven and earth, therefore, no one, who does not acknowledge Him, is admitted into heaven, for heaven is His body; but he stands below, and is bitten by serpents, that is, by infernal spirits, for whose bite there is no cure but that which the sons of Israel experienced by looking up to "the brazen serpent" (<a href="3927/numbers_21_1.htm">Numbers 21:1-9</a>); by which is meant the Lord as to the Divine Human, as is plain from this passage in John:<p>As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in Him, should not perish, but have eternal life, (<a href="3927/john_3_14.htm">John 3:14-15</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 469 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>469. (Vers. 2.) "Et habebat in manu Sua Libellum apertum," significat Verbum quoad id doctrinae ibi, quod Dominus sit Deus Caeli et Terrae, et quod Humanum Ipsius sit Divinum. - Quod per "Librum," quem Agnus accepit ex Sedente super Throno, et cujus septem sigilla solvit, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_469/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_5_1" target=_top>Apocalypsis 5:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_469/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_5_7" target=_top>7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_469/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_6_1" target=_top>6:1</a>), intelligatur Verbum, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_469/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256" target=_top>256</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_469/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_259" target=_top>259</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_469/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_295" target=_top>295</a>, seq.); quare per "Libellum" in manu Angeli, Qui etiam est Dominus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_469/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_465" target=_top>465</a>), hic non aliud intelligitur quam Verbum quoad aliquod Essentiale ibi; quod hoc sit id doctrinae in Verbo, quod Dominus sit Deus Caeli et Terrae, et quod Humanum Ipsius sit Divinum, patet a singulis in hoc capite et in sequente in Sensu spirituali; et quoque ex Sensu naturali capitis sequentis (xi.), vers. 15-17. Dicitur "Libellus apertus," quia illud exstat manifeste in Verbo, et patet cuivis qui legit, si attendit. De hoc nunc agitur, quia hoc est ipsum Essentiale Ecclesiae Novae. Causa est, quia a cognitione et agnitione Dei pendet salus cujusvis, est enim sicut dicitur in Praefatione, "Quod super justa idea Dei fundetur universum Caelum, et in terris universa Ecclesia, et in genere omnis Religio, quia per illam est conjunctio, et per conjunctionem lux, sapientia, et felicitas aeterna." Nunc quia Dominus est Ipse Deus Caeli et Terrae, quare si Ipse non agnoscitur, non aliquis admittitur in Caelum, Caelum enim est Corpus Ipsius; sed is stat infra, et mordetur a serpentibus, hoc est, a spiritibus infernalibus, a quibus non datur sanatio, nisi quae fuerat filiis Israelis, ut spectarent ad "Serpentem aeneum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_469/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_21_1-9" target=_top>Numeri 21:1-9</a>) <sup>1</sup>per quem quod intelligatur Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum, patet ex his apud Johannem: <p>"Sicut Moses exaltavit Serpentem in deserto, ita oportet exaltari Filium Hominis, ut omnis qui credit in Ipsum non pereat, sed vitam aeternam habeat," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_469/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_3_14-15" target=_top>3:14-15</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;1-9 pro "1 ad 10" </p>
