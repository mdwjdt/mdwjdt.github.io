<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第914节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>914.启21:19.“城墙的根基是用各样宝石修饰的”表取自圣言字义的新耶路撒冷教义的全部事物在那里的人当中将照着接受而显现在光中。“十二根基”表示教会教义的全部事物（<a href="902.htm">902</a>节）。“墙”表示字义中的圣言（<a href="898.htm">898</a>节）。“圣城耶路撒冷”表示主的新教会（<a href="879.htm">879</a>，<a href="880.htm">880</a>节）。“宝石”表示凭灵义而透明的字义中的圣言（<a href="231.htm">231</a>，<a href="540.htm">540</a>，<a href="726.htm">726</a>，<a href="911.htm">911</a>节）；由于这一切是照着接受实现的，所以这句话表示源于圣言的教义的全部事物将照着接受而显现在光中。凡不明智思考的人都不能相信新教会的全部事物会显现在光中，不过，要让他们知道他们有能力相信，因为人皆有一个外在思维和一个内在思维。内在思维在天堂之光中，被称为领悟（perception）；外在思维在尘世之光中；每个人所拥有的理解力具有这样的性质：它能被提升，甚至升到天堂之光中，若他凭着某种快乐想要看到真理，也的确被提升。我通过大量经历得以知道这是事实，关于这些奇妙的事，可参看《圣治》，详情可参看《圣爱与圣智》。因为爱与智慧的快乐提升思维，能使人如在光中那样看到事实的确如此，尽管他所听到的事前所未闻。启示心智的这光是由主那里从天堂流入的，并非从其它源头流入；由于那些将要属于新耶路撒冷的人即将直接靠近主，所以这光便照着次序流入，也就是通过意愿之爱流入理解力的领悟。</p><p>不过，那些确认这一信条，即理解力在神性问题上什么也不会看见，但教会的教导必须被盲目相信之人，则不能在这光中看到任何真理，因为他们已经在自己里面阻塞了光的通道。改革宗教会因来源于天主教而将这个信条保留下来，天主教传承的教导是，除了教会本身，没有人能解释得了圣言，而他们所理解的教会是指教皇和教廷议会；凡不因着信接受教会所传承下来的一切教义之人，都会被视为异端，他便成了可憎恶的。这一事实从《特兰托会议信纲》明显可知，该信纲确认了天主教的一切信条，其中在末尾就说了这些事：“然后，会议主席莫罗尼（Moronus）说：‘平安的去吧。’于是众人欢呼，洛林红衣主教与教父便在其他人当中宣告：我们全都如此相信，我们全都持这种观点，我们都同意并接受对它的赞成。这是蒙福的彼得和众使徒之信，这是是教父之信，这是正统之信。是的，阿们，阿们！一切异端受诅咒，受诅咒，受诅咒！” 特兰托会议的法令就是本书开头概要引述的那些内容，然而其中几乎没有一个真理。</p><p>引用这些内容，是为了让人们知道，改革宗或新教从天主教那里保留了一个盲目的信仰，就是脱离理解力的信仰；那些持这种信仰的人此后无法在神性真理中被主启示。只要理解力被囚禁在对信仰的服从之下，或理解力从看到教会的真理中被移除，神学就变得什么也不是，不过是记忆的东西而已。唯独记忆的东西会像脱离判断的一切事那样化为泡影，并由于它的昏暗而灭亡。因此他们是：</p><p>瞎子领瞎子，当瞎子领瞎子时，两个人都要掉在坑里。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太15.14.htm">15:14</a>）</p><p>他们就是瞎眼的，因为他们不从门进入，而是从其它途径进入（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.1.htm">10:1</a>）；因为耶稣说：</p><p>我就是门，凡从我进来的，必然得救，并且出入得草吃。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.9.htm">10:9</a>）</p><p>“得草吃”是指在神性真理上被教导、启示和滋养。所有不从门，也就是不从主进入的人，都被称为“贼”和“强盗”；而那些从门，也就是从主进入的人，则被称为“羊的牧人”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.1.htm">10:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.2.htm">2</a>）。所以，我的朋友，请你去找主，避恶如罪，弃绝唯信，然后你的理解力将被打开，你就会看到奇迹，并被它们打动。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 914</h4><p>914. <a href="3927/revelation_21_19.htm">21:19</a> The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kinds of precious stones. This symbolically means that all of the doctrines of the New Jerusalem taken from the Word's literal sense will, among the people in that church, be seen in a state of light, in accordance with their reception of it.<p>The twelve foundations symbolize all of the church's doctrines (no. <a href="902.htm">902</a>). The wall symbolizes the Word in its literal sense (no. <a href="898.htm">898</a>). The holy city Jerusalem symbolizes the Lord's New Church (nos. <a href="879.htm">879</a>, <a href="880.htm">880</a>). Precious stones symbolize the Word in its literal sense with its spiritual sense shining through (nos. <a href="231.htm">231</a>, <a href="540.htm">540</a>, <a href="726.htm">726</a>, <a href="911.htm">911</a>). And because this depends on its reception, therefore the symbolic meaning is that all of the doctrines from the Word among the people in that church will be seen in a state of light in accordance with their reception of it.<p>People who fail to think rationally cannot believe that everything connected with the New Church can be seen in a state of light. But I assure them that it is possible, for everyone has an outer thought and an inner one. The inner thought thinks in the light of heaven and is called perception, while the outer thought thinks in the light of the world. Moreover the intellect in everyone is so formed that it can be raised even into the light of heaven, and also is raised if it is moved by some delight to wish to see a truth. The reality of this is something I have been given to know through long experience, and marvelous things as a result of it may be seen in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Providence, and still more in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom. For the delight of love and wisdom elevates the thought to see that something is so, as though in a state of light, even if it had not heard it before. This light that enlightens the mind flows in from no other source than the Lord and heaven. And because people who will be those of the New Jerusalem will turn directly to the Lord, this light will flow in in the orderly way, namely through the will's love into the intellect's perception.</p><p>[2] On the other hand, people who entrench in themselves this dogma, that the intellect in theological matters is not going to see anything, but that people must believe blindly whatever the church teaches - people like that cannot see any truth in a state of light, for they have blocked up the path of the light in themselves.<p>The Protestant Reformed church has retained this dogma from the Roman Catholic religion, which holds that no one but the church - by which they mean the Pope or Papal Consistory - is to interpret the Word, and that anyone who does not embrace with faith all of the doctrines handed down by the church is to be regarded as a heretic and as an anathema or one accursed. The fact of this is clear from the concluding session of the Council of Trent, which established all the dogmas of that religion, where it says toward the end:<p>Then... Morone, the... President, ...said, ."..go in peace."<p>There followed acclamations, and among them those of the Cardinal of Lorraine and the Fathers:<p>[The Cardinal:] We all thus believe; we all think the very same; we all, consenting and embracing [them], subscribe. This is the faith of blessed Peter, and of the Apostles: this is the faith of the Fathers: This is the faith of the Orthodox....<p>[The Fathers:] So be it... Amen, Amen.<p>[The Cardinal:] Anathema to all heretics.<p>[The Fathers:] Anathema, anathema.<p>The decrees of that Council are those we presented in summary previously at the outset of this work, and they contain, indeed, scarcely one truth.</p><p>[3] We have cited this to make known that the Protestant Reformed have retained this blind faith, that is, a faith without understanding, from the Roman Catholic religion, and those who continue to hold onto it cannot be enlightened by the Lord in Divine truths.<p>As long as the intellect is held captive in obedience to faith, or as long as the intellect is set aside so as not to see the church's truths, theology becomes nothing but a matter of the memory; and a matter of the memory alone fades away, like any matter disconnected from a judgment concerning it, and it perishes from its own lack of clarity. People like that are therefore "blind leaders of the blind," and when "the blind leads the blind, both fall into a ditch" (<a href="3927/matthew_15_14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>).<p>They are blind also because they do not enter by the door, but in some other way. <sup>1</sup>For Jesus said:<p>I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture. (<a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">John 10:9</a>)<p>To find pasture means to be instructed, enlightened, and nourished in Divine truths.<p>All those who do not enter by the door, that is, by the Lord, are in that same chapter called "thieves and robbers." But those who enter by the door, that is, by the Lord, are called "shepherds of the sheep" (<a href="3927/john_10_1.htm">John 10:1-2</a>).<p>Therefore turn to the Lord, my friend, refrain from evils as being sins, and reject faith alone. And then your intellect will be opened, and you will see marvels and be affected by them.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Cf. <a href="3927/john_10_1.htm">John 10:1</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 914</h4><p>914. [verse 19] 'And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone' signifies that all the things of the doctrine of the New Jerusalem, selected out of the sense of the letter of the Word with those who are there, are going to appear in light according to reception. By 'the twelve foundations' are signified all the things of the doctrine (<a href="902.htm">902</a>). By 'the wall' is signified the Word in the sense of the letter (<a href="898.htm">898</a>). By 'the holy city, Jerusalem' is signified the Lord's New Church (<a href="879.htm">879-880</a>). By 'a precious stone' is signified the Word in the sense of the letter transparent by virtue of its spiritual sense (<a href="231.htm">231</a>, <a href="540.htm">540</a>, <a href="726.htm">726</a>, <a href="911.htm">911</a>); and because this is effected according to reception, therefore it is signified that all the things of the doctrine derived from the Word with those are going to appear in light according to reception. Everyone who does not think soundly is unable to believe that all the things of the New Church can appear in light, but let them know that they can, for every man has an exterior and an interior thought. The interior thought is in the light of heaven and is called perception, and the exterior thought is in the light of the world; and the understanding with every man is such that it can be raised up even into the light of heaven, and also is raised up if by virtue of any delight he wants to see the truth. That this is the case it has been given to know through much experience, concerning which wonderful things may be seen in ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE PROVIDENCE ; and still more in ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM. For the delight of love and wisdom raises the thought up enabling one to see as in the light that it is so, although he had not heard the thing before. This light that enlightens the mind inflows from no other source than out of heaven from the<p>Lord; and because those who will belong to the New Jerusalem are going to approach the Lord directly, that light inflows by the way of order, which is through the love of the will into the perception of the understanding.</p><p>[2] But those who have confirmed with themselves the dogma, that in theological matters the understanding is going to see nothing, but that what the Church teaches must be believed blindly, are not able to see any truth in the light, for they have obstructed the way of light with themselves. This dogma the Church of the Reformed has retained by derivation from the Roman Catholic form of religion, which passes on the teaching that no one except the Church itself, by which they understand the Pontiff and the Papal Consistory, is going to interpret the Word, and that he who does not by faith embrace all the doctrines passed on by the Church is to be considered as a heretic, and that he is anathema. That this is the case is established from the conclusion of the Council of Trent, in which all the dogmas of that form of religion have been confirmed, where these things are stated at the end:<p>Then the president, Moronus, said, 'Go in peace.' There followed acclamations, among others these of the cardinal of Lorraine and the fathers: We all so believe, we are all of this very opinion, we all consenting and embracing subscribe to it. This is the faith of the blessed Peter and of the Apostles, this is the faith of the Fathers, this is the faith of the orthodox. So be it, Amen, Amen, Anathema to the whole body of heretics, Anathema, Anathema.'<p>The decrees of that Council are those that have been quoted at the beginning of this work in a summary, in which however there is scarcely one truth. These things have been quoted so that it may be known that the Reformed have retained from that form of religion a blind faith, that is, a faith separated from the understanding; and those who retain it hereafter cannot be enlightened in Divine Truths by the Lord. So long as the understanding is held captive under obedience to faith, or the understanding is removed from seeing the truths of the Church, theology becomes nothing but a matter of memory. And a matter solely of the memory comes to naught like every matter freed from the judgment pertaining to it, and perishes on account of its obscurity. Consequently:<p>There are blind leaders of the blind, and when one blind man leads another, both fall into the ditch. <a href="3927/matthew_15_14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>; and they are blind because they do not enter in by the door, but some other way; for Jesus said:<p>I am the door, by Me if anyone enters in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. <a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">John 10:9</a>.<p>'To find pasture' is to be taught, enlightened and nourished in Divine truths. All who do not enter by the door, that is by the Lord, are called 'thieves' and 'robbers'; but those who enter by the door, that is, by the Lord, are called 'shepherds of the sheep,' in the same chapter <a href="3927/revelation_10_1.htm">10:1-2</a>. Therefore, my friend, go to the Lord, and flee from evils as sins, and reject faith alone, and then your understanding will be opened and you will see wonderful things and be affected by them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 914</h4><p>914. Verse 19. And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone, signifies that all things of the doctrine of the New Jerusalem taken from the sense of the letter of the Word, with those who are therein, will appear in light according to reception. By "the twelve foundations" are signified all things of doctrine, (<a href="902.htm">902</a>). By "the wall" is signified the Word in the sense of the letter, (<a href="898.htm">898</a>). By "the holy city Jerusalem" is signified the Lord's New Church, (<a href="879.htm">879</a>, <a href="880.htm">880</a>). By "precious stone" is signified the Word in the sense of the letter, pellucid from its spiritual sense, (<a href="231.htm">231</a>, <a href="540.htm">540</a>, <a href="726.htm">726</a>, <a href="911.htm">911</a>). And because this is according to reception, therefore it signifies that all things of doctrine from the Word with them, will appear in light according to reception. All who do not think sanely, cannot believe that all things of the New Church can appear in light, but let them know that they can, for every man has exterior and interior thought. Interior thought is in the light of heaven, and is called perception, and exterior thought is in the light of the world; and the understanding of every man is such that it can be elevated even into the light of heaven, and also is elevated, if from any delight he wishes to see truth. That this is so, has been given me to know by much experience, concerning which, wonderful things may be seen in the Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Providence; and still more in the Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom. For the delight of love and wisdom elevates the thought, enabling one to see as in the light that a thing is so, although he had never heard it before. This light, which enlightens the mind, flows in from no other source than out of heaven from the Lord; and as they who will be of the New Jerusalem, will directly approach the Lord, that light will flow in, by the way of order, which is through the love of the will into the perception of the understanding.</p><p>[2] But they who have confirmed themselves in that dogma, that the understanding in theological things is to see nothing, but that what the church teaches must be believed blindly, cannot see any truth in the light, for they have obstructed the way of the light into themselves. This dogma the Reformed Church has retained from the Roman Catholic religious persuasion, which declares that no one but the church itself, by which they mean the pope and papal consistory, ought to interpret the Word, and that he who does not in faith embrace all the doctrine delivered by the church, is to be considered as a heretic, and is accursed. That this is the case, is evident from a clause of the Council of Trent, in which all the dogmas of that religion are established, and where these words are at the end: "Then the president, Moronus, said, 'Go in peace. ' There followed acclamations, and among others this declaration of the cardinal of Lorraine and the fathers: 'We also believe, we are all of this very opinion, we all consenting and embracing, subscribe to it; this is the faith of the blessed Peter and of the apostles, this is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the orthodox. So be it, Amen, Amen, Anathema to all heretics, Anathema, Anathema. '" The decrees of that Council are quoted in a summary at the beginning of this work, in which, indeed, there is scarcely a single truth.</p><p>[3] These particulars are quoted to show that the Reformed have retained from that religious persuasion a blind faith, that is, a faith separated from the understanding; and they who do retain it henceforth cannot be enlightened in Divine truths from the Lord. So long as the understanding is held captive under obedience to faith, or so long as the understanding is removed from seeing the truths of the church, theology is only a thing of the memory, and a thing of the memory only is dissipated, like everything disunited from the judgment, and perishes from its obscurity. Hence it is, that they are:<p>Blind leaders of the blind. And when the blind lead the blind, both fall into the ditch, (<a href="3927/matthew_15_14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>).<p>And they are blind, because they do not enter in through the door, but some other way; for Jesus said:<p>I am the door: by Me if anyone enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture, (<a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">John 10:9</a>).<p>"To find pasture" is to be taught, enlightened, and nourished in Divine truths; for all who do not enter in through the door, that is, through the Lord, are called "thieves and robbers;" but they who enter in through the door, that is, through the Lord, are called "shepherds of the sheep" in the same chapter, (<a href="3927/john_10_1.htm">John 10:1-2</a>). Do thou, therefore, my friend, go to the Lord, and shun evils as sins, and reject faith alone, and then your understanding will be opened, and you will see wonderful things, and be affected by them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 914 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>914. (Vers. 19.) "Et fundamenta muri urbis omni lapide pretioso exornata," significat quod omnia doctrinae Novae Hierosolymae ex Sensu literae Verbi desumpta apud illos qui ibi sunt, apparitura sint in luce secundum receptionem. - Per "duodecim fundamenta" significantur omnia doctrinae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_914/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_902" target=_top>902</a>); per "murum" significatur Verbum in Sensu literae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_914/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_898" target=_top>898</a>); per "urbem sanctam Hierosolymam" significatur Nova Domini Ecclesia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_914/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_879" target=_top>879</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_914/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_880" target=_top>880</a>); per "lapidem pretiosum" significatur Verbum in Sensu literae pellucens ex Sensu spirituali ejus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_914/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_231" target=_top>231</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_914/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_540" target=_top>540</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_914/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_726" target=_top>726</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_914/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_911" target=_top>911</a>); et quia hoc fit secundum receptionem, ideo significatur quod omnia doctrinae ex Verbo apud illos apparitura sint in luce secundum receptionem. Omnis qui non sane cogitat, non potest credere quod omnia Ecclesiae novae possint apparere in luce; at sciant quod possint: nam cuivis homini est cogitatio exterior et interior; cogitatio interior est in luce Caeli et vocatur perceptio, et cogitatio exterior est in luce mundi; ac intellectus apud unumquemvis hominem talis est ut possit elevari usque in lucem Caeli, et quoque elevatur si ex aliquo jucundo vult videre verum; quod ita sit, per multam experientiam scire datum est, de qua videantur mirabilia in Sapientia Angelica de Divina Providentia, et adhuc plura in Sapientia Angelica de Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia: nam jucundum amoris et sapientiae elevat cogitationem, ut videat sicut in luce quod ita sit, tametsi non prius audiverat illa. Haec lux, quae mentem illustrat, non aliunde influit quam e Caelo a Domino; et quia illi qui e nova Hierosolyma erunt, directe adituri sunt Dominum, lux illa influit via ordinis, quae est per amorem voluntatis in perceptionem intellectus. Ast qui confirmaverunt apud se illud dogma, quod intellectus in theologicis nihil visurus sit, sed quod caece credendum sit quod Ecclesia docet, illi non possunt aliquod verum in luce videre, obstruxerunt enim viam lucis apud se: hoc dogma retinuit Ecclesia Reformatorum ex Religioso Romano Catholico, quod tradit quod nullus praeter ipsam Ecclesiam, per quam intelligunt Pontificem et Papale Consistorium, interpretaturus sit Verbum, et quod qui non fide amplectitur omnia doctrinae ab Ecclesia traditae, pro haeretico habendus sit, et quod anathema sit: quod ita sit, constat ex clausula Concilii Tridentini in quo omnia dogmata istius Religiosi constabilita sunt, ubi haec ad finem dicuntur: <p>Dixit tunc Praeses Moronus, "Ite in pace." <p>Secutae acclamationes; inter alias haec (dixerunt) cardinalis e Lotharingia et Patres:- <p>(Card.) "Omnes ita credimus, omnes id ipsum sentimus, omnes consentientes et amplectentes subscribimus; haec est fides beati Petri et Apostolorum; haec est fides Patrum; haec est fides Orthodoxorum. <p>(Respons.) "(Fiat,) fiat. Amen, Amen." <p>(Card) "Anathema cunctis haereticis." <p>(Respons.) "Anathema, Anathema." <p>Decreta illius Concilii sunt quae supra in principio hujus operis in summa adducta sunt, in quibus tamen vix unum verum est. Haec allata sunt, ut sciatur, quod Reformati caecam fidem, hoc est, fidem separatam ab intellectu retinuerint ex Religioso illo; et qui posthac retinent illam non possint illustrari in Divinis Veris a Domino. Quamdiu intellectus captivatur sub obedientia fidei, seu intellectus removetur a videndis veris Ecclesiae, fit theologia non nisi quam res memoriae; et res solius memoriae dissipatur sicut omnis res dissoluta a suo judicio, et perit ex suo obscuro Inde est, quod sint "Duces caeci caecorum; et quando caecus caecum ducit, ambo in foveam cadunt," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_914/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_15_14" target=_top>Matthaeus 15:14</a>);<p>et sunt caeci, quia non ingrediuntur per januam, sed aliunde; Jesus enim dicit, <p>"Ego sum Janua: per Me si quis introiverit, salvabitur, et ingredietur et egredietur, et pascuum inveniet," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_914/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_10_9" target=_top>Johannes 10:9</a>);<p>"pascuum invenire" est doceri, illustrari et nutriri in Divinis veris. Omnes qui non intrant per Januam, hoc est, per Dominum, vocantur fures et latrones;" at qui intrant per Januam, hoc est, per Dominum, vocantur "pastores ovium," in eodem capite, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_914/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_10_1-2" target=_top>10:1-2</a>); ergo adi, amice, Dominum, et fuge mala ut peccata, et rejice solam fidem, et tunc aperietur intellectus tuus, et videbis mirabilia, et afficieris illis. </p>
