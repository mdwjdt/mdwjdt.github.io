This symbolically means that no one is acknowledged as a Protestant Reformed Christian but one who accepts that doctrine in faith and love.<p>To receive a mark means, symbolically, to be acknowledged as a Protestant Reformed Christian, or to be among those who confess what the doctrine teaches. The mark is an acknowledgement that the person is such a one, and also a confession that he is such. The right hand symbolizes everything in a person relating to the power of his intellect, thus to his faith; for the right hand symbolizes a person's power (no. <a href="457.htm">457</a>). The forehead symbolizes everything in a person relating to the power of his will, thus to his love; for the forehead symbolizes love (no. <a href="347.htm">347</a>). </p>
