<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>909.启21:17.“又量了城墙，共有一百四十四肘”表显示新教会中圣言的性质，其一切真理和良善皆源于圣言。“量”表示显示其性质，如前所述（<a href="907.htm">907</a>节）；“墙”表示字义中的圣言（<a href="898.htm">898</a>节）；“一百四十四”表示来自圣言的教会一切真理和良善（<a href="348.htm">348</a>节）；“肘”表示性质，“量”所表相同；“一百四十四”与“十二”所表相同，因为12与12的乘积是<a href="144.htm">144</a>，乘积并不影响它的含义。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 909</h4><p>909. <a href="3927/revelation_21_17.htm">21:17</a> Then he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits. This symbolically means that John was shown the nature of the Word in that church, that from it come all of its truths and goods.<p>The angel's measuring means, symbolically, that its character was shown, as in no. <a href="907.htm">907</a> above. The wall symbolizes the Word in its literal sense (no. <a href="898.htm">898</a>). A hundred and forty-four symbolizes all the truths and goods of the church from the Word (no. <a href="348.htm">348</a>). Cubits symbolize character, like any unit of measure.<p>The number 144, in fact, has the same symbolic meaning as the number 12, because the product of 12 multiplied by 12, or 12 squared, is the number 144, and multiplication does not take away its symbolism. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 909</h4><p>909. [verse 17] 'And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty-four cubits' signifies that it was shown what the quality of the Word is in that Church, that from it are derived all its truths and goods. By 'he measured' is signified that the quality was shown, as above (<a href="907.htm">907</a>). By 'the wall' is signified the Word in the sense of the letter (<a href="898.htm">898</a>). By 'a hundred and forty-four' are signified all the truths and goods of the Church derived from the Word (<a href="348.htm">348</a>). By 'cubits' is signified the quality, the like as by 'measure'; for by 144 is signified the like as by 12, because out of 12 multiplied or calculated (multiplicatis seu ductis) into 12 arises the number 144, and the multiplication does not take away the signification. </p> 
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 909</h4><p>909. Verse 17. And he measured the wall thereof a hundred forty-four cubits, signifies that it was shown what the quality of the Word is in that church, and that from it they have all their truths and goods. By "he measured," is signified that its quality was shown, as above, (<a href="907.htm">907</a>); by "the wall" is signified the Word in its literal sense, (<a href="898.htm">898</a>); by "a hundred and forty-four" are signified all the truths and goods of the church from the Word, (<a href="348.htm">348</a>); by "cubits" is signified quality, the same as by "measure;" for by "one hundred and forty-four" is signified the same as by "twelve," because from twelve multiplied by twelve arises the number one hundred and forty-four, and multiplying it does not take away its signification. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 909 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>909. (Vers. 17.) "Et mensus est murum ejus, centum quadraginta quatuor cubitorum," significat quod ostensum sit quale est Verbum in illa Ecclesia, quod ex illo sint omnia vera et bona ejus. -Per "mensus est" significatur ostensum quale, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_909/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_907" target=_top>907</a>); <sup>1</sup>per "murum" significatur Verbum in Sensu literae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_909/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_898" target=_top>898</a>); per "centum quadraginta quatuor" significantur omnia vera et bona Ecclesiae ex Verbo (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_909/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348" target=_top>348</a>); per "cubitos" significatur quale, simile quod per "mensuram:" per "centum quadraginta quatuor" enim significatur simile quod per "duodecim" quia ex duodecim multiplicatis seu ductis in duodecim exsurgit numerus centum quadraginta quatuor, et multiplicatio non aufert significationem.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;907 pro "908" </p>
