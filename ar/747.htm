<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第747节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>747.“使她冷落赤身”表他们抛弃天主教的虚假与邪恶。“使她冷落”表示抛弃天主教的虚假；“使她赤身”表示抛弃天主教的邪恶；因为他们自己“使她冷落赤身”。在圣言中，“冷落”（desolation，经上又译为荒凉，凄凉）论及真理与虚假，“赤身”论及良善与邪恶；这一点从前面所引用涉及“赤身”的经文明显看出来（<a href="213.htm">213</a>，<a href="706.htm">706</a>节）。从这些事明显可知，“使她冷落赤身”表示他们抛弃天主教的一切虚假与邪恶。众所周知，新教或改革宗就是这么做的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 747</h4><p>747. "And make her desolate and naked." This symbolically means that Protestants will rid themselves of the falsities and evils of the Roman Catholic religion.<p>To make her desolate means, symbolically, to rid themselves of the Roman Catholic religion's falsities, and to make her naked means, symbolically, to rid themselves of its evils, for they make it desolate and naked in themselves. Desolation in the Word is predicated of truths and falsities, while nakedness is predicated of goods and evils, as can be seen from what we have presented regarding nakedness in nos. <a href="213.htm">213</a>, <a href="706.htm">706</a> above.<p>It can be seen from this that their making her desolate and naked means symbolically that they will rid themselves of all that religion's falsities and evils. People know that this is what Protestants or the Reformed have done. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 747</h4><p>747. 'And shall make her desolate and naked' signifies that they will divest themselves of its untruths and evils. By 'to make her desolate' is signified to divest themselves of its untruths, and by 'to make her naked' is signified to divest themselves of its evils; for they make her desolate and naked with themselves. In the Word desolation is predicated of truths and untruths, and nakedness of goods and evils, as can be established from the things that have been adduced concerning nakedness, above (<a href="213.htm">213</a>, <a href="706.htm">706</a>). From these things it can be established that by 'they shall make her desolate and naked' is signified that they will divest themselves of all the untruths and evils of that form of religion. That the Protestants or Reformed have done so is known. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 747</h4><p>747. And shall make her desolate and naked, signifies that they will put off from themselves her falsities and evils. By "making her desolate" is signified to put off from themselves her falsities; and by "making her naked" is signified to put off from themselves her evils; for they make her desolate and naked with themselves. Desolation in the Word is predicated of truths and falsities, and nakedness of goods and evils; as may be evident from the passages that were adduced above concerning nakedness, (<a href="213.htm">213</a>[1-4], <a href="706.htm">706</a>). From these things it may be evident that by "their making her desolate and naked" is signified that they will put off from themselves all the falsities and evils of that religious persuasion. That the Protestants or the Reformed have done so, is known. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 747 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>747. Et desolatam facient illam, et nudam," significat quod exuent se falsis et malis ejus. - Per "desolatam facere illam" significatur exuere se falsis ejus, et per "illam nudam facere" significatur exuere se malis ejus; nam desolatam et nudam faciunt illam apud se. Desolatio in Verbo praedicatur de veris et falsis, et nuditas de bonis et malis, ut constare potest ex illis quae de nuditate, supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_747/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_213" target=_top>213</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_747/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_706" target=_top>706</a>) adducta sunt. Ex his constare potest, quod per "desolatam facient illam et nudam" significetur quod exuent se omnibus falsis et malis Religiosi istius. Quod Protestantes seu Reformati ita fecerint, notum est. </p>
