<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第465节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>465.启10:1.“我又看见另有一位大力的天使，从天降下”表大有神性威荣和能力的主。这位“天使”就是主，这一点从对他的描述明显看出来，如“披着云彩，头上有虹，脸面像日头，两脚像火柱”、“他右脚踏海，左脚踏地”，以及“大声呼喊，好像狮子吼叫，说话像打雷”。祂之所以看似一位天使，是因为当祂显明自己时，便在众天堂之中和之下显为一位天使；因为祂以其神性充满某位天使，以适应那些蒙祂恩准得以看见祂之人的接受程度。没有哪位天使，更不用说世人，能承受诸如主在自己或在自己本质里面那样的显现；所以祂在众天堂之上显为一轮太阳，与天使相距甚远，犹如世间太阳距离世人那样遥远。在那里，祂自永恒就居于祂的神性中，同时居于祂的神性人中，它们就像灵魂和身体那样为一体。祂在此因其神性大能而被称为“大力的天使”；经上之所以说“另一位天使”，是因为此处描述的是祂不同于前者的另一个神性属性。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 465</h4><p>465. I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. (<a href="3927/revelation_10_1.htm">10:1</a>) This symbolizes the Lord in His Divine majesty and power.<p>That the angel here is the Lord is apparent from his description, that he was clothed with a cloud, with a rainbow over his head; that his face was like the sun and his feet like pillars of fire; and that he kept his feet on the sea and on the land; moreover that he cried out as when a lion roars, and that his voice was like thunder.<p>He appeared as an angel because that is how He appears when He manifests Himself in the heavens and below the heavens. For He fills some angel with His Divinity in accommodation to the reception of those whom He gives to see Him. No angel, and still less any mortal, can endure His presence as He is in Himself or in His essence. Therefore He appears above the heavens as the sun, which is as distant from angels as the world's sun is from people. He is present there in His Divinity from eternity and at the same time in His Divine humanity, which are united like soul and body.<p>He is called here a mighty angel because of His Divine power. And He is called another angel owing to the fact that described here is another aspect of His Divinity than was described before. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 465</h4><p>465. [verse 1] 'And I saw another angel, a strong one, coming down out of heaven' signifies the Lord in Divine Majesty and Power. That the 'angel' here is the Lord is plain from the description of Him, as being encompassed with a cloud, a rainbow overhead, His face as the sun, His feet as pillars of fire, and that He kept His feet upon the sea and the land; as also that He cried out as a lion roars, and uttered speech as thunder. He was seen as an angel because when He manifests Himself in the heavens and below the heavens He appears as an angel. For He fills some angel with His Divine accommodated to the reception of those to whom He grants the seeing of Him. His presence itself, such as He is in Himself or His own Essence, is not sustained by any angel, much less by any man; and therefore He appears above the heavens as the Sun, which is distant from angels as the sun of the world is from men. There He is in His Divine from eternity and at the same time in His Divine Human, which, as soul and body, are a one. He is here called 'a strong angel' by reason of Divine power; and is termed 'another angel' on account of this, that here is described a Divine of His other than the former. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 465</h4><p>465. Verse 1. And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, signifies the Lord in Divine majesty and power. That this "angel" is the Lord, is evident from the description of him, as being "encompassed with a cloud, a rainbow over his head, his face as the sun, his feet like columns of fire," and that he set his feet upon the sea and upon the earth; as also that he cried with a great voice as a lion roareth, and spoke as thunder. He was seen as an angel, because He appears as an angel in the heavens and below the heavens, when He manifests Himself; for He fills some angel with His Divine in accommodation to the reception of those to whom He grants to see Him. His presence itself, such as He is in Himself or in His own essence, cannot be supported by any angel, much less by any man; wherefore He appears above the heavens as a sun, at a distance from the angels, as the sun of this world is from men. There He dwells in His Divine from eternity, and at the same time in His Divine Human, which are a one like soul and body. He is here called "a mighty angel" from His Divine power; and it is said, "another angel," by reason of another Divine attribute of His, different from the former, being here described. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 465 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>465. (Vers. 1.) "Et vidi alium Angelum fortem descendentem e Caelo," significat Dominum in Divina Majestate et Potentia. - Quod "Angelus" hic sit Dominus, patet a descriptione Ejus, quod "circumdatus nube, iris supra caput, facies Ejus sicut Sol, pedes Ejus sicut columnae ignis," et quod teneret pedes Suos super mari et super terra; tum quod clamaverit sicut leo rugit, et locutus sicut tonitru. Quod visus sit sicut Angelus, est quia apparet in Caelis et infra Caelos, quando Se manifestat, ut Angelus; implet enim aliquem Angelum Divino Suo accommodate ad receptionem illorum quibus Se dat videndum; ipsam praesentiam Ipsius, qualis est in Se aut Sua Essentia, non aliquis Angelus, et minus aliquis homo, sustinet; quare apparet supra Caelos ut Sol, qui distat ab Angelis sicut sol mundi ab hominibus; ibi est in Divino Suo ab aeterno et simul in Divino Suo Humano, quae unum Sunt Sicut anima et corpus. Vocatur hic "Angelus fortis" ex Divina Potentia: et dicitur "alius Angelus" ex eo, quod aliud Divinum Ipsius hic describatur quam prius. </p>
