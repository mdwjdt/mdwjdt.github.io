<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第792节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>792.启18:22.“弹竖琴者，作乐者，吹笛者，吹号者的声音，在你中间决不能再听见”表他们当中不再有对属灵真理和良善的任何情感，也不再有对属天良善和真理的任何情感。“声音”表示音调，每种音调对应于一种属于爱的情感，因为音调是由情感产生的。所以，竖琴、音乐和笛子的音调凭对应关系而表示情感。不过，情感分为两类，即属灵的和属天的。属灵的情感是智慧的情感，属天的情感是爱的情感。它们彼此不同，犹如被分为两个国度，即属天国和属灵国的众天堂（如前面频繁所述）彼此不同。因此，有些乐器的音调与属灵的情感有关，有的与属天的情感有关。弹竖琴者和作乐者的声音或音调与属灵的情感有关，吹笛者和吹号者的声音或音调与属天的情感有关。声音不连贯的乐器，如弦乐器，属于属灵情感那一类；声音连贯的乐器，如管乐器，属于属天情感那一类。这就是为何“弹竖琴者和作乐者的” 声音或音调表示对属灵真理与良善的情感，而“吹笛者和吹号者的” 声音或音调表示对属天真理与良善的情感。竖琴的音调因对应而表示出于对属灵真理情感的称谢（参看<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="661.htm">661</a>节）。</p><p>此处意思是说，那些陷入天主教的邪恶与虚假之人没有对属灵真理与良善的任何情感，也没有对属天真理与良善的任何情感，因为经上说“弹竖琴者，作乐者，吹笛者，吹号者的声音，在你中间决不能再听见”。他们之所以没有这些情感，是因为他们由于缺乏出于圣言的任何真理而无法被赋予它们；并且他们因没有真理，故也没有任何良善。良善只能被赋予那些渴慕真理的人；而除了那些靠近主的人之外，没有人出于属灵的情感渴慕真理；这些人死后照其渴慕程度而得到天使的教导，并接受真理。他们在聆听弥撒曲和参加其它宗教仪式（这些活动都缺乏从主经由圣言而来的真理）时所处的外在情感纯粹是属世、感官和肉体的；由于他们具有这种性质，并且缺乏源于主的内在，所以他们在浓密的黑暗和盲目中被带向对活人、死人的敬拜，并向那些被称为冥王的鬼魔献祭，来为他们的灵魂赎罪就不足为奇了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 792</h4><p>792. <a href="3927/revelation_18_22.htm">18:22</a> "The sound of harpists and musicians, flutists and trumpeters, shall not be heard in you anymore." This symbolically means that they will not have in them any affection for spiritual truth and goodness, nor any affection for celestial truth and goodness.<p>A sound means tone, and every tone corresponds to some affection relating to love, since it originates from love. For this reason, the sounds of harps, music, flutes and trumpets, because of their correspondence, symbolize affections.<p>Affections, however, are of two types: spiritual and celestial. Spiritual affections are affections connected with wisdom, while celestial affections are affections connected with love. They differ from each other in the same way as the heavens, which have been distinguished into two kingdoms, celestial and spiritual, as we have said several times before.<p>The sounds of some musical instruments, therefore, relate to spiritual affections, and the sounds of others to celestial affections - the sound or tone of harpists and musicians relating to spiritual affections, and the sound or tone of flutists and trumpeters relating to celestial affections. For instruments whose tones sound in distinct intervals, like stringed instruments, belong to the spiritual class of affections, while instruments whose tones are continuous, like wind instruments, belong to the celestial class of affections. Thus the sound or tone of harpists and musicians symbolizes an affection for spiritual truth and goodness, while the sound or tone of flutists and trumpeters symbolizes an affection for celestial truth and goodness.<p>That the sound of a harp, owing to its correspondence, symbolizes confession from an affection for spiritual truth, may be seen in nos. <a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>.</p><p>[2] The meaning here is that no affections for spiritual truth and goodness and no affections for celestial truth and goodness are found in people who are caught up in the evils and falsities of the Roman Catholic religion, because we are told that "the sound of harpists and musicians, flutists and trumpeters, shall not be heard in you anymore." None are found because in their case none are possible; for they do not have any truth from the Word, and lacking truth, they do not have any goodness. Goodness is possible only in people who desire truths. But the only people who desire truths from a spiritual affection are those who turn to the Lord. After death they are instructed by angels and receive truths in accordance with their desire.<p>The external affections they have when they hear masses said and in other devotions, being without truths from the Lord through the Word, are nothing but merely natural, sensual and carnal affections. And because that is their character, and they have no internal affections from the Lord, it is no wonder that they are brought in that dark and blind state to a worship of men, living and dead, and to the sacrifices of demons, called plutos, to atone for their souls. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 792</h4><p>792. [verse 22] 'And the voice of harpers and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters shall not be heard in thee any more' signifies that with them there will not be any affection of spiritual truth and good, nor affection of celestial truth and good. By 'the voice' is understood the sound, and every sound corresponds to an affection that is of love, since it arises therefrom. Consequently the sounds of the harp, of music, and of the flute, by virtue of the correspondence signify affections. But affections are of two kinds, spiritual and celestial. Spiritual affections are affections of wisdom, and celestial affections are affections of love. They differ from each other in the same way as the heavens, which, as has frequently been said above, are distinguished into two kingdoms, the celestial and the spiritual. There are therefore musical instruments the sounds of which relate to spiritual affections, and there are those that relate to celestial affections. The voice or sound of harpers and musicians relates to spiritual affections, and the voice or sound of flute-players and trumpeters to celestial affections. For the instruments the sounds of which are discrete, as stringed instruments, pertain to the class of spiritual affections; and the instruments of which the sounds are continuous, as wind instruments, pertain to the class of celestial affections. This is why the voice or sound 'of harpers and musicians' signifies the affection of spiritual truth and good, while the voice or sound 'of flute-players and trumpeters' signifies the affection of celestial truth and good. That the sound of the harp from correspondence signifies confession out of the affection of spiritual truth may be seen (<a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>).</p><p>[2] It is here understood that those who are in the evils and untruths of the Roman Catholic form of religion have neither affections of spiritual truth and good nor affections of celestial truth and good, for it is said that 'the voice of harpers and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters shall not be heard in thee any more.' The reason why they do not have them is because with them they cannot be given, for they do not have any truth out of the Word; and because there is no truth, neither is there any good. This is given only with those who desire truths; but no others desire truths out of a spiritual affection than those who approach the Lord. These, in accordance with this desire of theirs, are instructed after death by angels and receive those truths. The external affections in which they are while they are hearing masses and in the other devotions that are without truths from the Lord by means of the Word are nothing but merely natural, sensual and corporeal affections; and because they are such, and without internals derived from the Lord, it is not to be wondered that in a dense darkness and blindness they are brought to the worship of living and dead persons, and to sacrifices to demons, who are called plutos, in order to make an atonement for their souls. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 792</h4><p>792. Verse 22. And the voice of harpers and musicians, and pipers and trumpeters, shall not be heard in thee anymore signifies that there will not be with them any affection of spiritual truth and good, nor any affection of celestial truth and good. By "voice" is meant sound, and every sound corresponds to any affection which is of love, since it arises therefrom. From this it is that the sounds of the harp, of music, and of the pipe, from correspondence, signify affections. But the affections are of two kinds, spiritual and celestial; spiritual affections are affections of wisdom, and celestial affections are affections of love. They differ from each other as the heavens, which are distinguished into two kingdoms, the celestial and the spiritual, as has several times been said above. There are therefore musical instruments whose sounds have relation to spiritual affections, and there are those which have relation to celestial affections. The voice or sound of "harpers and musicians" has relation to spiritual affections, and the voice or sound of "pipers and trumpeters" to celestial affections. For the instruments whose sounds are discrete, as stringed instruments, pertain to the class of spiritual affections; and the instruments whose sounds are continuous, as wind instruments, pertain to the class of celestial affections. Hence it is, that the voice or sound of "harpers and musicians" signifies the affection of spiritual good and truth, and the voice or sound of "pipers and trumpeters" signifies affection of celestial good and truth. That the sound of the harp from correspondence signifies confession from the affection of spiritual truth, may be seen, (<a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>).</p><p>[2] It is here meant that they who are in the evils and falsities of the Roman Catholic religious persuasion have no affections of spiritual truth and good, nor any affections of celestial truth and good, because it is said that "the voice of harpers and of musicians and of pipers and trumpeters shall not be heard in thee anymore." The reason that they do not have them is because they cannot be given with them, for they have not any truth from the Word; and because they have no truth, neither have they any good. The latter is given to those only who desire truths; but no others desire truths from spiritual affection, but they who go to the Lord; these, according to this their desire, are instructed by the angels after death, and receive truths. The external affections in which they are while they are hearing masses, and in other devotions, which are without truths from the Lord through the Word, are merely natural, sensual, and corporeal; and as they are such, and are without internals from the Lord, it is not to be wondered at that in this thick darkness and blindness they are carried away to the worship of living and dead men, and to sacrifices to demons, who are called plutos, to make expiation for their souls. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 792 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>792. (Vers. 22.) "Et vox citharaedorum et musicorum, et tibicinum et buccinatorum non audietur in te amplius," significat quod apud illos non erit aliqua affectio veri et boni spiritualis, nec affectio veri et boni caelestis. Per "vocem" intelligitur sonus, et omnis sonus correspondet affectioni quae amoris, quoniam inde oritur. Ex eo est, quod soni citharae, musices, tibiae, ex correspondentia significent affectiones. Sed affectiones sunt duplicis generis, spirituales et caelestes; affectiones spirituales sunt affectiones sapientiae, et affectiones caelestes sunt affectiones amoris: differunt inter se quemadmodum Caeli, qui quod distincti sint in duo Regna, caeleste et spirituale, supra aliquoties dictum est. Sunt itaque instrumenta musica, quorum soni se referunt ad affectiones spirituales, et sunt quae se referunt ad affectiones caelestes; vox seu sonus "citharaedorum et musicorum" ad affectiones spirituales, et vox seu sonus "tibicinum et buccinatorum" ad affectiones caelestes: instrumenta enim, quorum soni discreti sunt, ut chordacea, ad classem affectionum spiritualium pertinent, et instrumenta quorum soni sunt continui, ut inflatoria, ad classem affectionum caelestium pertinent. Inde est, quod vox seu sonus "citharaedorum et musicorum" significet affectionem veri et boni spiritualis, ac vox seu sonus "tibicinum et buccinatorum" significet affectionem veri et boni caelestis. Quod sonus citharae ex correspondentia significet confessionem ex affectione veri spiritualis, videatur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_792/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_276" target=_top>276</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_792/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_661" target=_top>661</a>). Quod nullae affectiones veri et boni spiritualis, nec affectiones veri et boni caelestis, sint illis qui in malis et falsis Religiosi Catholico Romani sunt, intelligitur hic; quia dicitur, quod "vox citharaedorum et musicorum, et tibicinum et buccinatorum, non audietur in te amplius." Quod non sint, est quia non possunt dari apud illos, non enim est illis aliquod verum ex Verbo, et quia non verum, nec est aliquod bonum. Hoc solum datur apud illos qui desiderant vera; at non alii desiderant vera ex affectione spirituali quam qui adeunt Dominum; hi secundum id desiderium suum, post mortem instruuntur ab angelis, et recipiunt illa. Affectiones externae, in quibus sunt dum audiunt Missas, et in aliis devotionibus, quae sunt absque veris a Domino per Verbum, non sunt nisi quam mere naturales, sensuales et corporeae; et quia tales sunt, et absque internis ex Domino, non mirum est quod in caligine et caecitate illa ferantur ad cultum hominum vivorum et mortuorum, et ad sacrificia daemonum qui Plutones vocantur, ut expient pro animabus illorum. </p>
