<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第480节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>480.启10:9.“我就走到天使那里，对他说，请把小书卷给我”表教会中许多人思想上倾向于接受这个教义。之所以表示这一点，是因为此处通过约翰来显明教会中的许多人如何接受关于主的这个教义，如刚才所述；之所以表示这些人思想上倾向于接受这个教义，是因为这种倾向在约翰身上表现得很明显，因他走上前去要这小书卷。由于这些事具有这样的含义，所以约翰首先被吩咐去拿小书卷；然后走上前去要小书卷；接着天使说会给他，但这小书卷会让他肚子发苦，最后经上说，小书卷给了他，事情就是如此发生的；所有这些事都是有重大意义的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 480</h4><p>480. So I went to the angel and said to him, "Give me the little book." (<a href="3927/revelation_10_9.htm">10:9</a>) This symbolizes a disposition of the heart with many people in the church to accept the doctrine.<p>This is the symbolic meaning because John here shows how many people in the church receive the doctrine regarding the Lord, as said just above. A disposition of the heart in them to accept it is meant because of the inclination in John to take it, since he went and asked for it.<p>Inasmuch as this account involves such particulars, therefore John was first told to take the little book, after which he went and asked for it, and the angel then told him he would give it to him, but that the little book would make his stomach bitter; and lastly we are told that he was given it, and that the prediction came to pass. These particulars all have a symbolic meaning. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 480</h4><p>480. [verse 9] 'And I went unto the angel, saying unto him, Give me the little book' signifies a movement of the mind with many in the Church towards receiving the doctrine. This is signified, because by means of John it is here made manifest how the doctrine concerning the Lord is received by many in the Church, as was said just above. A movement of the mind with these towards receiving it is understood, because of the inclination in the case of John, for he went and asked. As these words involve such things, therefore it was first said to John that he should take the little book; after that he went and took it, and then the angel said that he was going to give it to him, but that the little book was going to make the belly bitter; and at length that he did give, and that it so came to pass. All these circumstances are significant. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 480</h4><p>480. Verse 9. And I went unto the angel, saying unto him, Give me the little book, signifies an inclination of the mind, with many in the church, to receive the doctrine. This is signified, because by John is here manifested how the doctrine concerning the Lord is received by many in the church, as just observed; an inclination of the mind with these to receive this doctrine is meant, because an inclination was apparent in John, in that he went and asked for it. As these things involve such a meaning, therefore John was first told to take the little book; he then went and asked for it; then the angel said that he would give it him, but that the little book would make his belly bitter; and lastly it is said that it was given him, and that it so came to pass; all these things being significative. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 480 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>480. (Vers. 9.) "Et abivi ad Angelum, dicens Ei, Da mihi Libellum," significat motionem animi apud plures in Ecclesia ad recipiendum doctrinam. - Hoc significatur, quia per Johannem hic manifestatur quomodo Doctrina de Domino in Ecclesia a pluribus recipitur, ut mox supra dictum est; motio animi apud hos ad recipiendum illam intelligitur, quia inclinatio apud Johannem, abivit enim et petiit. Quoniam haec involvunt talia, ideo primum dictum est Johanni ut acciperet Libellum, dein abivit et petiit, tum dixit Angelus quod daturus illum, sed quod Libellus amaricaturus ventrem, et demum quod datus Sit, et quod ita factum; omnia illa significant. </p>
