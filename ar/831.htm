<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第831节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>831.启19:17.“我又看见一位天使站在日头中，向空中所飞的一切鸟大声呼喊说，你们聚集来赴大神的筵席”表主出于神性之爱，因而出于神性热情呼召并召集所有处于对真理的属灵情感，并思想天堂的人进入新教会，与祂自己结合，因而进入永生。“一位天使站在日头中”表示在神性之爱中的主；“天使”表示主，“日头”表示祂的神性之爱。“大声呼喊说”表示出于神性热情；事实上，从主出于神性之爱的声音或流注来自神性的热情；因为热情属于爱。“空中所飞的鸟”表示所有处于对真理的属灵情感，因而思想天堂的人。“你们聚集来赴神的大筵席”表示呼召并召集到新教会，与主结合；由于永生来自与主的结合，故也表示进入永生。呼喊说“来”表示呼召，“聚集”表示召集。</p><p>在圣言中，“一位天使”表示主（参看<a href="5.htm">5</a>，<a href="170.htm">170</a>，<a href="258.htm">258</a>，<a href="344.htm">344</a>，<a href="465.htm">465</a>，<a href="649.htm">649</a>，<a href="657.htm">657</a>，<a href="718.htm">718</a>节）；此处更是如此，因为约翰见祂“站在日头中”；没有哪个天使出现在日头，即太阳当中，因为主是灵界的太阳，所以唯独主在太阳当中。“日头”当论及主时，表示神性之爱（参看<a href="53.htm">53</a>，<a href="414.htm">414</a>节）。显然，“大声呼喊”当论及主时，表示出于神性热情说话或流入；因为神性热情属于神性之爱，在此是指对拯救世人的热情。“鸟”表示诸如属于理解或认知，因而属于思维的那类事物（<a href="757.htm">757</a>节）；在此表示那些处于对真理的属灵情感，并思想天堂的人，因为经上说“空中所飞的鸟”；在“空中飞”表示觉察、关注并思考（<a href="245.htm">245</a>，<a href="415.htm">415</a>节）。“神的大筵席”表示新教会，因而与主的结合（参看<a href="816.htm">816</a>节）；在那里他们的晚餐被称为“羔羊之婚筵”。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 831</h4><p>831. <a href="3927/revelation_19_17.htm">19:17</a> Then I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, "Come and gather together for the supper of the great God." This symbolizes the Lord, out of Divine love and so out of Divine zeal, calling all people who have a spiritual affection for truth and think about heaven, and summoning them to the New Church and to conjunction with Himself, thus to eternal life.<p>The angel standing in the sun means the Lord in His Divine love. The angel means the Lord, and the sun His Divine love. Crying with a loud voice means, symbolically, out of Divine zeal, for a voice or influx coming from the Lord out of Divine love is an expression of Divine zeal, inasmuch as zeal is a characteristic of love. Birds that fly in the midst of heaven symbolize all people who have a spiritual affection for truth and so think about heaven. To come and gather together for the supper of the great God symbolizes a calling and summoning to the New Church and to conjunction with the Lord; and because conjunction with the Lord is attended by eternal life, therefore this, too, is symbolically meant. To cry "come" symbolizes a calling, and "gather together" symbolizes a summoning.</p><p>[2] That an angel in the Word means the Lord may be seen in nos. <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="170.htm">170</a>, <a href="258.htm">258</a>, <a href="344.htm">344</a>, <a href="465.htm">465</a>, <a href="649.htm">649</a>, <a href="657.htm">657</a>, <a href="718.htm">718</a> above, and the more so here because he was seen standing in the sun, and no angel appears in the sun. For the Lord is the sun in the spiritual world, and therefore the Lord alone is present in it. That the sun in reference to the Lord symbolizes Divine love may be seen in nos. <a href="53.htm">53</a> and <a href="414.htm">414</a>. Clearly, to cry with a loud voice in reference to the Lord in His Divine love means, symbolically, to speak or flow in out of Divine zeal; for Divine zeal is a characteristic of Divine love, in this case for the salvation of humankind. That birds symbolize such things as are connected with the intellect and consequent thought may be seen in no. <a href="757.htm">757</a> above, and in this case people who have a spiritual affection for truth and think about heaven, since the cry is addressed to birds that fly in the midst of heaven, and to fly in the midst of heaven means, symbolically, to discern, focus on, and think (nos. <a href="245.htm">245</a>, <a href="415.htm">415</a>). That the supper of the great God symbolizes the New Church and thus conjunction with the Lord, may be seen in no. <a href="816.htm">816</a>, where that supper is called the marriage supper of the Lamb. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 831</h4><p>831. [verse 17] 'And I saw one angel standing in the Sun, and he cried out with a great voice saying to all the birds flying in the midst of heaven, Come and flock together to the Supper of the Great God' signifies the Lord out of Divine Love, and consequently out of Divine Zeal, calling and assembling all who are in the affection of spiritual truth and who think about heaven to the New Church and to conjunction with Himself, thus to eternal life. By the 'angel standing in the Sun' is understood the Lord in Divine Love. By 'an angel' is understood the Lord, and by the Sun' His Divine Love. By 'to cry out with a great voice' is signified out of Divine Zeal, for a 'voice' or influx from the Lord out of Divine Love is out of Divine Zeal, for the Zeal is of the Love. By 'the birds flying in the midst of heaven' are signified all who are in the affection of spiritual truth and consequently think about heaven. By 'to come and flock together to the Supper of the Great God' is signified a calling and assembling to the New Church and to conjunction with the Lord; and because the result of conjunction with the Lord is eternal life, therefore that also is signified. By 'to cry out, Come' the calling is signified, and by 'to flock together' is signified the assembling.</p><p>[2] That by 'an angel' in the Word is understood the Lord may be seen above (<a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="170.htm">170</a>, <a href="258.htm">258</a>, <a href="344.htm">344</a>, <a href="465.htm">465</a>, <a href="649.htm">649</a>, <a href="657.htm">657</a>, <a href="718.htm">718</a>); the more so here because He was seen to stand in the Sun, and no angel appears in the Sun, for the Lord is the Sun of the spiritual world, and therefore the Only Lord is there. That by the Sun,' where it treats of the Lord, is signified Divine Love may be seen (<a href="53.htm">53</a>, <a href="414.htm">414</a>). Because Divine Zeal is of Divine Love here [Zeal] for the salvation of men, it is plain that by 'to cry out with a great voice' when said of the Lord in Divine Love is signified to speak or to inflow out of Divine Zeal. That by 'birds' are signified such things as are of the understanding and consequently of the thought [may be seen] above (<a href="757.htm">757</a>). Here [are signified] those who are in the affection of spiritual truth and think about heaven, since it is said 'the birds flying in the midst of heaven,' and by 'to fly in the midst of heaven' is signified to perceive, pay attention to and think (<a href="245.htm">245</a>, <a href="415.htm">415</a>). That by 'the Supper of the Great God' is signified the New Church and thus conjunction with the Lord [see <a href="816.htm">816</a>], where their Supper is called 'the Supper of the Lamb's wedding. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 831</h4><p>831. Verse 17. And I saw an angel standing in the sun, and He cried with a great voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, Come, and gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God, signifies the Lord from the Divine love and thence from Divine zeal calling and calling together all who are in the spiritual affection of truth, and who think of heaven, to the New Church, and to conjunction with Himself, and thus to eternal life. By "the angel standing in the sun" is meant the Lord in the Divine love; by "the angel" the Lord is meant, and by "the sun" His Divine love. By "crying with a great voice" is signified from Divine zeal; for a voice or influx from the Lord from the Divine love is from Divine zeal; for zeal is of love. By "the birds that fly in the midst of heaven" are signified all who are in the spiritual affection of truth, and thence think of heaven. By "coming and being gathered together to the supper of the great God," is signified a calling and a calling together to the New Church and to conjunction with the Lord; and because eternal life is from conjunction with the Lord, therefore that is also signified. By crying "come" the calling is signified, and by "gather yourselves together" is signified the calling together.</p><p>[2] That the Lord is meant in the Word by "an angel," may be seen above, (<a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="170.htm">170</a>, <a href="258.htm">258</a>, <a href="344.htm">344</a>, <a href="465.htm">465</a>, <a href="649.htm">649</a>, <a href="657.htm">657</a>, <a href="718.htm">718</a>); the more so here, as He was seen to stand in the sun; and no angel appears in the sun, for the Lord is the sun of the spiritual world; wherefore the Lord alone is there. That by "the sun," when speaking of the Lord, the Divine love is signified, may be seen, (<a href="53.htm">53</a>, <a href="414.htm">414</a>). That by "crying with a great voice," when said of the Lord in the Divine love, is signified to speak or flow in from Divine zeal, is manifest; because the Divine zeal is of the Divine love, here for the salvation of men. That such things as are of the understanding and thence of the thought are signified by "birds," see above, (<a href="757.htm">757</a>); here they who are in the spiritual affection of truth, and think concerning heaven, since it is said, "the birds that fly in the midst of heaven:" and by "flying in the midst of heaven" is signified to observe, attend, and think, (<a href="245.htm">245</a>, <a href="415.htm">415</a>). That the New Church, and thus conjunction with the Lord, are signified by "the supper of the great God," see, (<a href="816.htm">816</a>); where their supper is called "the marriage supper of the Lamb." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 831 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>831. (Vers. 17.) "Et vidi unum Angelum stantem in Sole; et clamavit voce magna, dicens omnibus avibus volantibus in medio Caeli, Venite et congregamini ad Caenam Magni Dei," significat Dominum ex Divino A more et inde ex Divino Zelo vocantem et convocantem omnes qui in affectione veri spirituali sunt, et de Caelo cogitant, ad Nova in Ecclesiam, et ad conjunctionem Secum, ita ad vitam aeternam. - Per "Angelum stantem in Sole" intelligitur Dominus in Divino Amore; per "Angelum" intelligitur Dominus, et per "Solem" Divinus Ipsius Amor: per "clamare voce magna" significatur ex Divino Zelo, nam vox seu influxus a Domino ex Divino Amore est ex Divino Zelo, nam Zelus est Amoris: per "aves volantes in medio Caeli" significantur omnes qui in affectione veri spirituali sunt, et inde cogitant de Caelo per "venire et congregamini ad Caenam Magni Dei" significatur vocatio et convocatio ad Novam Ecclesiam et ad conjunctionem cum Domino; et quia ex conjunctione cum Domino est vita aeterna, ideo etiam id significatur; per clamare "Venite" significatur vocatio, et per "congregamini significatur convocatio. Quod per "Angelum" in Verbo intelligatur Dominus, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_831/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_5" target=_top>5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_831/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_170" target=_top>170</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_831/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_258" target=_top>258</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_831/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_344" target=_top>344</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_831/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_465" target=_top>465</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_831/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_649" target=_top>649</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_831/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_657" target=_top>657</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_831/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_718" target=_top>718</a>); hic eo plus, quia visus est stare in Sole, et nullus angelus apparet in Sole; est enim Dominus Sol mundi spiritualis, quare Solus Dominus ibi est; quod per "Solem," ubi de Domino, significetur Divinus Amor, videatur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_831/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_53" target=_top>53</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_831/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_414" target=_top>414</a>); quod per "clamare voce magna," cum de Domino in Divino Amore, significetur loqui seu influere ex Divino Zelo, patet; quia Divinus Zelus est Divini Amoris, hic pro salvatione hominum: quod per "aves" significentur talia quae intellectus sunt et inde cogitationis, supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_831/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_757" target=_top>757</a>); hic qui in affectione veri spirituali sunt, et de Caelo cogitant, quoniam dicitur "avibus volantibus in medio Caeli," et per "volare in medio Caeli" <sup>1</sup>significatur perspicere, attendere et cogitare (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_831/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245" target=_top>245</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_831/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_415" target=_top>415</a>); quod per "Caenam Magni Dei" significetur Nova Ecclesia, et sic conjunctio cum Domino, (videatur) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_831/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_816" target=_top>816</a>, ubi Caena illorum vocatur "Caena nuptiarum Agni."<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Caeli pro "Caelo" </p>
