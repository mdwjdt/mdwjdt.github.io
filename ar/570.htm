<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>570.“角上有十个冠冕”表歪曲众多圣言真理的能力。“角”表示能力（<a href="539.htm">539</a>节）；“十”表示大量（<a href="101.htm">101</a>节）；“冠冕”表示被歪曲的圣言真理（<a href="540.htm">540</a>）；因此，“角上有十个冠冕”表示他们拥有歪曲众多圣言真理的能力。论到“龙”，经上说他头上有“七个冠冕”，而论到的这兽，经上却说他“角上有十个冠冕”；原因在于，此处表示歪曲众多圣言真理的能力，而那里表示歪曲它们全部的能力；事实上，平信徒能够歪曲它们全部，但却没有这么做；因为陷入虚假和对它们的信仰之人反对真理，因而当看到圣言中的真理时，他们便歪曲它们。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 570</h4><p>570. And on its horns ten jewels. <sup>1</sup>This symbolizes their power to falsify many of the Word's truths.<p>Horns symbolize power (no. <a href="539.htm">539</a>). Ten symbolizes much or many (no. <a href="101.htm">101</a>). And jewels here symbolize truths of the Word falsified (no. <a href="540.htm">540</a>). Therefore, having on its horns ten jewels means, symbolically, to have it in their power to falsify many of the Word's truths.<p>Regarding the dragon, we are told that it had on its heads seven jewels, but here, as regards this beast, that it had on his horns ten jewels. The reason is that symbolized in this case is the power to falsify many of the Word's truths, but in the previous case a falsification of all its truths. <sup>2</sup>The laity, indeed, can do the latter, though they do not. For people caught up in falsities and having a faith in them are opposed to truths, and consequently they falsify truths in the Word when they see them.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The word translated as "jewels" here means diadems or crowns in the original Greek and Latin, but the writer's definitions of the term elsewhere make plain that he regularly and consistently interpreted it to mean jewels or gems.<br><br>2.&nbsp;See no. 540. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 570</h4><p>570. 'And upon his horns ten diadems' signifies the power of falsifying many truths of the Word. By 'horns' power is signified (<a href="539.htm">539</a>); by 'ten' is signified much (<a href="101.htm">101</a>); and by 'diadems' are signified the truths of the Word falsified (<a href="540.htm">540</a>). Consequently, by 'upon his horns ten diadems' is signified to have the power to falsify many truths of the Word. It is said of the dragon that 'upon his heads' he had 'seven diadems,' but of this beast that 'upon his horns' he had 'ten diadems.' This is because here it signifies the power of falsifying many truths of the Word, but there the falsification of them all; for the laity are able [to falsify them all] but do not do so; for those who are in untruths and in the faith pertaining to them are against truths, and therefore while they are seeing truths in the Word they are falsifying them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 570</h4><p>570. And upon his horns ten diadems, signifies the power of falsifying many truths of the Word. By "a horn" is signified power, (<a href="539.htm">539</a>); by "ten" is signified much, (<a href="101.htm">101</a>[1-3]) and by "diadems" are signified the truths of the Word falsified, (<a href="540.htm">540</a>); therefore by "upon his horns ten diadems," is signified to have it in his power to falsify many truths of the Word. Of the dragon it is said that he had "seven diadems" on his heads, but of this beast that he had "ten diadems" on his horns; the reason is, because here it signifies the power of falsifying many truths of the Word, but there the falsification of all; for the laity are able, but do not; for they who are in falsities and in the belief of them, are opposed to truths, consequently, when they see truths in the Word, they falsify them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 570 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>570. "Et super cornubus suis decem diademata" significat potentiam falsificandi multa vera Verbi. - Per "cornua" significatur potentia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_570/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_539" target=_top>539</a>); per "decem" significatur multum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_570/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_101" target=_top>101</a>); et per "diademata" significantur vera Verbi falsificata (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_570/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_540" target=_top>540</a>); inde, per "super cornubus suis decem diademata," significatur habere in potentia falsificare multa vera Verbi: de Dracone dicitur quod super capitibus suis haberet "septem diademata," de hac autem ejus Bestia, quod super cornubus suis haberet "decem diademata;" causa est quia hic significatur potentia falsificandi multa vera Verbi, ibi autem falsificatio omnium Laici enim possunt, sed non faciunt; illi enim qui in falsis sunt et in fide illorum, contra vera sunt, quare dum vident vera in Verbo, falsificant illa. </p>
