<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第202节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>202.“你也不冷也不热”表他们时而否认、时而承认圣言是神性和神圣的。时而否认、时而承认圣言的神圣就是“也不冷也不热”，因为他们既反对圣言，也认同圣言。对于神和教会的一切，他们也是这样，时而否认，时而承认。由于这个缘故，他们时而与地狱的人同在，时而又与天堂的人同在。他们仿佛在这二者之间飞行，时上时下，飞到哪里，就把脸转到哪里。凡曾经确信神、天堂与地狱、永生的存在，后来又退却者，就变成这等人。当起初的确信返回时，他们就承认；当它不返回时，他们就否认。他们之所以退却，是因为后来他们只思想自己和世界，总希望高人一等，由沉浸于他们的自我之中；因此，地狱便将他们吞没了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 202</h4><p>202. "'That you are neither cold nor hot.'" This symbolically means that people such as these sometimes deny that the Word is Divine and holy, and sometimes acknowledge that it is.<p>To sometimes deny in oneself the holiness of the Word, and sometimes acknowledge it, is to be neither cold nor hot, for such people are both against the Word and for the Word.<p>The same people are of a like character also with respect to God. They sometimes deny Him and sometimes acknowledge Him. So likewise with respect to everything else connected with the church. They are accordingly at times with the inhabitants of hell, and at times with the inhabitants of heaven. They fly, as it were, up and down between the two, and they turn their face in the direction they are flying.<p>Those who become of such a character are people who have affirmed in themselves the existence of God, of heaven and hell, and eternal life, and who afterward have turned away from these. In their case, when the earlier affirmation recurs, they acknowledge, but when it does not recur, they deny.<p>The reason they turn away is that they afterward think only about themselves and the world, continually seeking to be superior to others, and as a result they immerse themselves in their native selves, so that hell swallows them up. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 202</h4><p>202. 'That thou art neither cold nor hot' signifies that they who are such at one time deny that the Word is Divine and Holy, and at another time acknowledge it. At one time to deny within themselves (apud se) the holiness of the Word, and at another time to acknowledge it, is to be 'neither cold nor hot,' for they are against the Word and also in favour of it. Such persons are also the same [in their feelings] concerning God, acknowledging Him at one time and denying Him at another; and likewise concerning all things of the Church. Therefore they are sometimes with those who are in hell and at other times with those who are in heaven, flying as it were upwards and downwards between the two, and in whatever direction they fly, thither they turn the face. Such do they become who have confirmed with themselves [the belief] that there is a God, a heaven and a hell, and eternal life, and afterwards go back [on this]. In their case, when the first confirmation returns, they acknowledge, but when it does not return, they deny. Their going back is because afterwards they think only of themselves and the world, seeking unceasingly to achieve supereminence, by which means they immerse themselves in their proprium. In this way hell swallows them up. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 202</h4><p>202. That thou art neither cold nor hot, signifies that they who are such, sometimes deny that the Word is Divine and holy, and at other times acknowledge it. At one time to deny the holiness of the Word, and at another time to acknowledge it, is "to be neither cold nor hot," for they are against the Word and also for the Word. They are also such concerning God, at one time they deny, and at another time acknowledge Him; in like manner as to all things of the church; for which reason they are sometimes with those who are in hell, and at other times with those who are in heaven. They fly as it were between both, up and down, and wherever they fly, thither they turn the face. They become such who have confirmed with themselves the belief in the existence of God, of heaven and hell, and of life eternal, and afterwards recede from it. When the first confirmation returns, they acknowledge, but when it does not return, they deny. They recede because they afterwards think only of themselves and the world, continually aspiring to preeminence, and thereby they immerse themselves in their proprium; thus hell swallows them up. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 202 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>202. "Quod nec frigidus sis nec calidus," significat quod qui tales sunt nunc negent quod Verbum Divinum et Sanctum sit, et nunc agnoscant. Nunc apud se negare et nunc agnoscere sanctitatem Verbi, est "nec frigidus esse nec calidus," sunt enim contra Verbum et quoque pro Verbo: iidem etiam tales sunt de Deo; nunc Ipsum negant et nunc agnoscunt: similiter de omnibus Ecclesiae; proinde sunt nunc cum illis qui in Inferno, nunc cum illis qui in Caelo; volant sicut inter utrumque sursum et deorsum, et quo volant eo faciem suam vertunt. Tales fiunt, qui apud se confirmaverunt quod Deus sit, Caelum et Infernum sint, ac Vita aeterna sit, et postea recedunt; apud illos cum prior confirmatio redit, agnoscunt cum autem non redit, negant: quod recedant, est quia postea solum de se et de mundo cogitant, continue ambientes supereminere, et per id se immergunt suo proprio; ita Infernum absorbet illos. </p>
