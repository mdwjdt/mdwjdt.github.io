<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第340节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>340.启6:17.“因为祂忿怒的大日到了，谁能站得住呢”表他们通过由于最后审判而与善者并忠信者分离变成这样，要不然，他们承受不住这最后的审判。“羔羊（祂）忿怒的大日”表示最后审判之日；“谁能站得住”表示他们由于所受的折磨而不能承受最后的审判；因为最后的审判即将来临之际，主与天堂一起靠近，那些在灵人界下面的人，除了那些内心善良，也就是避恶如罪并仰望主的人以外，其他人都无法忍受主的到来。“主忿怒的日子”表示最后的审判。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>在耶和华的烈怒临到你们之前，在耶和华发怒的日子临到你之前，你必在耶和华发怒的日子隐藏起来。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.2.htm">2:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.3.htm">3</a>）</p><p>看哪，耶和华的日子临到，必有残忍、忿恨、烈怒。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.9.htm">13:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>耶和华的大日临近，是忿怒的日子，是急难困苦的日子，是黑暗幽冥、密云乌黑的日子。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.14.htm">1:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.15.htm">15</a>）</p><p>你的忿怒也临到了，审判死人、你的仆人得赏赐、毁灭那些毁灭地之人的时候也到了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.18.htm">11:18</a>）</p><p>当亲吻子，恐怕祂发怒，你们便在道中灭亡，因为祂的怒气快要发作，凡投靠他的，都是有福的。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗2.12.htm">2:12</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 340</h4><p>340. "For the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?" (<a href="3927/revelation_6_17.htm">6:17</a>) This symbolically means that they became of such a character of themselves as a result of their separation from good and faithful people, because of the Last Judgment, which they could not otherwise endure.<p>The great day of the Lamb's wrath symbolizes the day of the Last Judgment. And "who is able to stand" symbolizes an inability to bear it because of the torture experienced. For when a last judgment is at hand, the Lord draws near with heaven, and of the people who are below in the world of spirits, only those are able to bear the Lord's coming who are inwardly good, and the inwardly good are people who refrain from evils as being sins and turn to the Lord.<p>That the day of the Lord's wrath symbolizes a last judgment is clearly apparent from the following passages:<p>While the wrath of the anger of Jehovah has not yet come upon you, while the day of the anger of Jehovah has not yet come upon you..., it may be that you will be hidden in the day of the anger of Jehovah. (<a href="3927/zephaniah_2_2.htm">Zephaniah 2:2-3</a>)<p>Behold, the day of Jehovah comes, cruel, and one of ire and the wrath of His anger... (<a href="3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>, cf. <a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">13:13</a>)<p>The great day of Jehovah is near... That day is a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish..., a day of darkness and pitch darkness... (<a href="3927/zephaniah_1_14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14-15</a>)<p>...Your wrath has come, and the time for judging the dead, and for rewarding Your servants..., and for destroying those who destroy the earth. (<a href="3927/revelation_11_18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>)<p>Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and you perish in the way, because His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all those who put their trust in Him. (<a href="3927/psalms_2_12.htm">Psalms 2:12</a>)<p>---------- </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 340</h4><p>340. [verse 17] 'Because the great day of His wrath is coming, and who is able to stand?' signifies that they became such from themselves through separation from the good and the faithful on account of the last judgment, which they would not otherwise endure. By 'the great day of the wrath of the Lamb' is signified the day of the last judgment: and by 'who is able to stand?' is signified inability to hold out by reason of torment; for when a last judgment is impending the Lord approaches with heaven, and out of those who are below in the world of spirits no others are able to endure the Lord's coming but those who are interiorly good, and they are interiorly good who shun evils as sins and look to the Lord. That 'the day of the Lord's wrath' signifies a last judgment is quite plain from these passages:<p>For as long as the growing anger of wrath of Jehovah is not yet coming upon you, for as long as the day of wrath of Jehovah is not yet coming upon you, it may be you shall be hid in the day of wrath of Jehovah, <a href="3927/zephaniah_2_2.htm">Zephaniah 2:2-3</a>.<p>Behold the day of Jehovah is coming, cruel, both with displeasure and the growing anger of wrath. <a href="3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">13</a>.<p>The great day of Jehovah is near, a day, this, of growing anger, a day of narrowness and crowding together, a day of darkness and thick darkness, <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14-15</a>.<p>Thy wrath is come, and the time of judging the dead, and of rewarding Thy servants, and of destroying those destroying the land. <a href="3927/revelation_11_18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>.<p>Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and you perish in the way, because His wrath is soon kindled. Blessed are all those trusting in Him. <a href="3927/psalms_2_12.htm">Psalms 2:12</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 340</h4><p>340. Verse 17. Because the great day of His anger is come, and who is able to stand? signifies that they were made such of themselves by their separation from the good and faithful on account of the Last Judgment, which otherwise they could not endure. "The great day of the anger of the Lamb," signifies the day of the Last Judgment; "and who is able to stand?" signifies their inability to endure it by reason of their torment; for when the Last Judgment is at hand, the Lord, together with heaven, approaches, and of those who are below in the world of spirits, no others can endure the Lord's coming, but those who are interiorly good, who shun evils as sins, and look to the Lord. That "the day of the Lord's anger" signifies the Last Judgment is evident from the following passages:<p>Before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovah's anger come upon you, it may be ye shall be hid in the day of Jehovah's anger, (<a href="3927/zephaniah_2_2.htm">Zephaniah 2:2-3</a>).<p>Behold the day of Jehovah cometh, cruel both with indignation and wrath of anger, (<a href="3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">13</a>).<p>The great day of Jehovah is near, a day of wrath, a day of straitness and distress, a day of darkness and thick darkness, (<a href="3927/zephaniah_1_14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14-15</a>).<p>Thy anger is come, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to give reward unto Thy servants, and to destroy them that destroy the earth, (<a href="3927/revelation_11_18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>).<p>Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and ye perish in the way, because His anger is kindled quickly; happy are all they that trust in Him, (<a href="3927/psalms_2_12.htm">Psalms 2:12</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 340 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>340. (Vers. 17.) "Quia venit dies magnus irae Ipsius et quis potent consistere," significat quod tales facti sint a se ipsis per separationem a bonis et fidelibus propter Ultimum Judicium, quod alioquin non sustinerent. - Per "diem magnum irae Agni" significatur dies Ultimi Judicii; et per "quis potest consistere" significatur non posse sustinere prae cruciatu: cum enim Ultimum Judicium instat, Dominus cum Caelo appropinquat; et ex illis qui infra sunt, in mundo spirituum, non alii Adventum Domini sustinere possunt, quam qui interius boni sunt; et illi interius boni sunt, qui fugiunt mala ut peccata, et spectant ad Dominum. Quod "dies irae Domini" significet Ultimum Judicium, patet manifeste ab his locis: <p>"Dum nondum venit super vos excandescentia Irae Jehovae, dum nondum venit super vos Dies irae Jehovae, forte abscondemini in Die irae Jehovae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_340/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zephaniah_2_2-3" target=_top>Zephanias 2:2-3</a>);<p>"Ecce Dies Jehovae venit crudelis, et indignationis, et excandescentiae Irae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_340/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_13_9" target=_top>Esaias 13:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_340/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_13_13" target=_top>13</a>);<p>"Propinquus est Dies Jehovae magnus, Dies excandescentiae Dies hic, Dies angustiae et coarctationis, Dies tenebrarum et caliginis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_340/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zephaniah_1_14-15" target=_top>Zephanias 1:14-15</a>);<p>"Venit Ira Tua, et tempus mortuos judicandi, et dandi mercedem servis Tuis, et perdendi perdentes terram," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_340/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_11_18" target=_top>Apocalypsis 11:18</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>"Osculamini Filium, ne irascatur et pereatis in via, quia excandescit brevi Ira Ejus; beati omnes confidentes in Ipso," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_340/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_2_12" target=_top>Psalm 2:12</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;18 pro "12" </p>
