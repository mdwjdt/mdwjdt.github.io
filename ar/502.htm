<p>502.“这城按着灵意叫所多玛，又叫埃及”表两种地狱之爱，也就是出于自我之爱的统治之爱，和出于对人自己聪明的骄傲的控制之爱或控制欲，它们就存在于不承认一位神，不拜主，也不照十诫生活的教会中。“所多玛”在属灵之义上表示出于自我之爱的统治之爱，这一点很快就会看到；“埃及”在属灵之义上表示出于对人自己聪明的骄傲的控制之爱或控制欲，这一点稍后也会论及；正因所表示的是这两种爱，所以“这城按着灵意叫所多玛，又叫埃及”。这些爱之所以盛行于不承认一位神，不拜主，也不照十诫生活的教会当中，是因为人就生在这两种爱中，随着长大逐渐进入这两种爱，这些爱只能被神救主通过遵行其诫命的生活而被移除；除非靠近神救主，否则它们无法被祂移除；除非人被祂引领，否则无法给予遵行十诫的生活。诚然，它能被给予，但不是里面含有天堂、因而教会的任何事物的生活。遵行十诫的生活只由那为生命的所赐给。而主就是那生命（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.4.htm">4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.26.htm">5:26</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.33.htm">6:33</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.35.htm">35</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.25.htm">11:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.26.htm">26</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.19.htm">19</a>等）。</p><p>出于自我之爱的统治之爱，和出于对人自己聪明的骄傲的控制之爱或控制欲是地狱众爱之首，因而教会中的众恶和由此而来的众虚假之首；这一事实如今无人知晓；这些爱的快乐胜过心灵一切愉悦的快乐，是它不为人知的原因，而事实上，按着灵意，它们就是“所多玛和埃及”。“所多玛”就是出于自我之爱的统治之爱，这一点从摩西五经中对所多玛的描述明显看出来：他们想对来到罗得家的天使们施暴；于是火与硫磺如雨般从天降到他们身上（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创19.1.htm">19:1</a>等）。“火”与“硫磺”普表示这爱及其欲望。当这类城市和社群在最后审判之日被倾覆的时候，我目睹了这些事物的发生，看到他们被投入地狱。这些爱及其邪恶就由“所多玛和蛾摩拉”来表示（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.10.htm">1:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.8.htm">3:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.9.htm">9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.19.htm">13:19</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.14.htm">23:14</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.18.htm">49:18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.37.htm">50:37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.40.htm">40</a>；耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.6.htm">4:6</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.46.htm">16:46</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.50.htm">50</a>；阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩4.11.htm">4:11</a>；西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.9.htm">2:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.10.htm">10</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申29.23.htm">29:23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.32.htm">32:32</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.14.htm">10:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.23.htm">11:23</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可6.11.htm">6:11</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.10.htm">10:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.12.htm">12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.28.htm">17:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.29.htm">29</a>）。</p><p>这爱由“所多玛”来表示，这一点在世上尚不为人知；但将这一点牢记在心，当死后进入灵人界时想起它，你就会完全信服。不过，要知道，既有出于自我之爱的统治之爱，也有出于功用之爱的统治之爱；后一种爱是属天，而前一种爱是属地狱的。因此，当一种构成头时，另一种就构成脚，也就是说，当出于自我之爱的统治之爱构成头时，出于功用之爱的统治之爱，也就是通过主而服侍邻舍之爱一开始构成脚，后来则构成脚底，最终被踩在脚下。但当出于功用之爱的统治之爱，也就是属天之爱，如前所述，构成头时，出于自我之爱的统治之爱，也就是地狱之爱，如前所述，一开始构成脚，后来则构成脚底，最终被踩在脚下。然而，世人很难辨别这两种爱，因为它们的外在形式都差不多；不过，可以此来辨别它们：属天之爱存在于那些靠近主，并照十诫生活的人身上；而地狱之爱则存在于那些不靠近主，也不照十诫生活的人身上。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 502</h4><p>502. Which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt. This symbolizes the two hellish loves, namely, a love of ruling springing from a love of self, and a love of holding sway from a conceit in one's own intelligence, loves which are present in the church where there is not one God and where the Lord is not worshiped, and where people do not live in accordance with the Ten Commandments.<p>Sodom symbolizes, in the spiritual sense, a love of ruling springing from a love of self, as we shall presently see; and Egypt symbolizes, in the spiritual sense, a love of holding sway from a conceit in one's own intelligence, as we shall also presently see. So, because these two loves are symbolized, therefore the city is called, spiritually speaking, Sodom and Egypt.<p>These two loves are present in the church where there is not one God and where the Lord is not worshiped, and where people do not live in accordance with the Ten Commandments, because people are born with these two loves, and they come into them as they grow up. Nor can these loves be removed except by God the Savior and by a life in accordance with His commandments, and God cannot remove them unless people turn to Him, and neither is a life in accordance with His commandments possible unless a person is led by Him. Actually it is possible, but not a life that contains anything of heaven and so of the church.<p>A life like that is possible only from Him who is life. That the Lord is that life may be seen in <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">4</a>; <a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">5:26</a>; <a href="3927/john_6_33.htm">6:33-35</a>ff., <a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">11:25-26</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">14:6</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_19.htm">19</a>, and in many other places.</p><p>[2] A love of ruling springing from a love of self, and a love of holding sway from a conceit in one's own intelligence, are the principal loves of all the loves in hell, and so are the origin of all the evils and thus of all the falsities in the church. This is something unknown at the present day. The delights of these loves, which surpass the delights of all the heart's pleasures, cause it to be unknown, even though they are, spiritually, Sodom and Egypt.<p>That Sodom is a love of ruling springing from a love of self can be seen from the description of Sodom in Genesis, where we are told that when angels arrived there, the inhabitants tried to forcibly assault them at the house of Lot, and that fire and brimstone rained down on them from heaven (<a href="3927/genesis_19_1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>ff.). Fire and brimstone symbolize that love, together with its appetites.<p>I saw similar sights when cities and societies of people like that were overthrown at the time of the Last Judgment and their inhabitants cast into hell.<p>These loves and their accompanying evils are symbolized by Sodom and Gomorrah in the following passages: <a href="3927/isaiah_1_10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_3_8.htm">3:8-9</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_13_19.htm">13:19</a>.</p><p>[3] That this love is symbolically meant by Sodom is unknown in the world, but remember it and recall it when you come after death into the world of spirits and you will be completely convinced.<p>It should be known, however, that a love of ruling springing from a love of self and a love of ruling springing from a love of performing useful services are two different things. The latter love is a heavenly love, while the first is a hellish one. Consequently, when one is in first place, the other is in last place; which is to say, when a love of ruling springing from a love of self forms the head, then a love of ruling springing from a love of performing useful services - which is a love of serving the neighbor originating from the Lord - forms first the feet, then the soles of the feet, and finally is trampled underfoot.<p>On the other hand, when a love of ruling springing from a love of performing useful services - which, as we said, is a heavenly love - forms the head, then a love of ruling springing from a love of self - which, as we said, is a hellish love - forms first the feet, then the soles of the feet, and finally is trampled underfoot.<p>Still, these two loves can hardly be distinguished by a person in the world. That is because in outward appearance they are similar. But they can be told apart by this, that a heavenly love is present in people who turn to the Lord and live in accordance with the Ten Commandments, while a hellish love is present in people who do not turn to the Lord, and who do not live in accordance with the Ten Commandments. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 502</h4><p>502. 'Which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt' signifies the two infernal loves, which are the love of dominion derived from the love of self and the love of ruling derived from the pride of self-intelligence, which exist in the Church where there is not one God and the Lord is not being worshipped, and where [the life] is not being lived in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue. By 'Sodom' in the spiritual sense is signified the love of dominion derived from the love of self, concerning which [something] follows; and by 'Egypt' in the spiritual sense is signified the love of ruling derived from the pride of self- intelligence, concerning which also [something] follows; and because these two loves are signified it is therefore said 'spiritually Sodom and Egypt.' The reason why these two loves exist in the Church where there is not one God and the Lord is not being worshipped, and where [the life] is not being lived in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue, is because a man is born into those two loves and he comes into them while he is growing up, and those loves cannot be removed except by God the Saviour and by a life in accordance with His precepts. And they cannot be removed by God the Saviour unless He is approached, nor can a life in accordance with His precepts be given unless the man is being led by Him. It can indeed be given, but not a life in which there is anything of heaven and the Church therefrom. That life is given only by Him Who is Life. That the Lord is that Life may be seen (<a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">John 1:4</a>; <a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">5:26</a>; <a href="3927/john_6_33.htm">6:33-35</a> seq.; <a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">11:25-26</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">14:6</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_19.htm">19</a>; and very frequently elsewhere).</p><p>[2] At this day it is not known that the love of dominion derived from the love of self and the love of ruling derived from the pride of self-intelligence are the heads of all the loves of hell, and thus the heads of all the evils and consequent untruths in the Church. The delights of those loves, which exceed the delights of all the pleasures of the mind (animus), cause it to be unknown, when yet they are 'spiritually Sodom and Egypt.' That 'Sodom' is the love of dominion derived from the love of self can be established from the description of Sodom in Moses, that on the occasion of the angels coming thereto they wanted to do violence to them in Lot's house, and that fire and sulphur rained upon them out of heaven (<a href="3927/genesis_19_1.htm">Genesis 19</a> seq.). That love, with its lusts, is signified by 'fire and sulphur.' I have seen similar things when the cities and associations [formed] out of such were overthrown on the day of the last judgment, and they were cast down into hell. Those loves and the evils thereof are signified by 'Sodom' and 'Gomorrah' in these places (<a href="3927/isaiah_1_10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_3_8.htm">3:8-9</a>; [<a href="3927/isaiah_13_1.htm">Isaiah 13</a>:] <a href="3927/isaiah_13_19.htm">19</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_23_14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_49_18.htm">49:18</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_37.htm">50:37</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_40.htm">40</a>; <a href="3927/lamentations_4_6.htm">Lamentations 4:6</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46-50</a>; <a href="3927/amos_4_11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>; <a href="3927/zephaniah_2_9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9-10</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_29_23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_29_22.htm">22</a>]; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_32.htm">32:32</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_10_14.htm">Matthew 10:14-15</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_11_23.htm">11:23</a>; <a href="3927/mark_6_11.htm">Mark 6:11</a>; <a href="3927/luke_10_10.htm">Luke 10:10-12</a>; <a href="3927/luke_17_28.htm">17:28-29</a>).</p><p>[3] It is not known in the world that that love is signified by 'Sodom'; but keep it in mind, and remember it when you come into the world of spirits, which happens after death, and you will be fully convinced. It should, however, be known that there is a love of dominion derived from the love of self and a love of dominion derived from the love of uses. The latter is heavenly, but the former is infernal; and therefore when one makes the head, the other makes the feet, that is, when the love of dominion derived from the love of self makes the head, then the love of dominion derived from the love of uses, which also is the love of being of service to the neighbour derived from the Lord, at first makes the feet, afterwards the soles of the feet, and at last is trampled under foot. In the world, however, these two loves can scarcely be distinguished by a man. This is because their external forms are alike, but they are differentiated by the fact that the heavenly love is with those who approach the Lord and live in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue, and the infernal love is with those who do not approach the Lord and do not live in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 502</h4><p>502. Which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt signifies the two infernal loves, which are the love of dominating from self-love, and the love of ruling from the pride of one's own intelligence, which are in the church where one God is not acknowledged, and the Lord is not worshiped, and where they do not live according to the precepts of the Decalogue. By "Sodom," in the spiritual sense, is signified the love of dominating from self-love, as will be seen presently; and by "Egypt," in the spiritual sense, is signified the love of ruling from the pride of one's own intelligence, which also will be spoken of presently; and because these two loves are signified, therefore it is spiritually called "Sodom and Egypt." The reason why these loves prevail in the church where one God is not acknowledged, and the Lord is not worshiped, and where they do not live according to the precepts of the Decalogue, is, because man is born into those two loves, and comes into them as he grows up, and those loves cannot be removed but by God the Savior, and by a life according to His precepts; and they cannot be removed by God the Savior, unless He is approached; nor can a life according to His precepts be given, unless man is led by Him. It can indeed be given, but not a life in which there is anything of heaven and thence of the church. That life is given only by Him who is life. That the Lord is that life, may be seen, (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">4</a>; <a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">5:26</a>; <a href="3927/john_6_33.htm">6:33-35</a>, and following verses; <a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">11:25-26</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">14:6</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_19.htm">19</a>; and in many other places).</p><p>[2] That the love of dominating from self-love, and the love of ruling from the pride of one's own intelligence, are the heads of all the loves of hell, and thus the heads of all the evils and thence of the falsities in the church, is unknown at this day; the delights of those loves, which exceed the delights of all the pleasures of the mind, are the causes of its not being known, when yet, "spiritually, they are Sodom and Egypt." That "Sodom" is the love of dominating from self-love, may appear from the description of Sodom in Moses, that they wished to do violence to the angels who came into Lot's house; and that fire and brimstone rained upon them out of heaven, (<a href="3927/genesis_19_1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>, and following verses). By "fire and brimstone," that love with its lusts is signified. I saw similar things happen when the cities and societies of such were overthrown in the day of the Last Judgment, and they were cast into hell. These loves and their evils are signified by "Sodom and Gomorrah" (in these places:<a href="3927/isaiah_1_10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_3_8.htm">3:8-9</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_13_19.htm">13:19</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_23_14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_49_18.htm">49:18</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_37.htm">50:37</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_40.htm">40</a>; <a href="3927/lamentations_4_6.htm">Lamentations 4:6</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46-50</a>; <a href="3927/amos_4_11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>; <a href="3927/zephaniah_2_9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9-10</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_29_23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_32.htm">32:32</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_10_14.htm">Matthew 10:14-15</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_11_23.htm">11:23</a>; <a href="3927/mark_6_11.htm">Mark 6:11</a>; <a href="3927/luke_10_10.htm">Luke 10:10-12</a>; <a href="3927/luke_17_28.htm">17:28-29</a>).</p><p>[3] That this love is signified by "Sodom," is not known in the world; but keep this in mind and remember it when you come into the world of spirits, as is done after death, and you will be fully convinced. But it is to be known, that there is a love of dominating from self-love, and a love of dominion from the love of uses; the latter love is celestial, but the former infernal. Therefore when one makes the head, the other makes the feet, that is, when the love of dominating from self-love makes the head, then the love of dominion from the love of uses, which is also the love of serving the neighbor from the Lord, at first makes the feet, afterwards the soles of the feet, and, lastly is trodden under foot. But when the love of dominion from the love of uses, which, as was said, is celestial love, makes the head, then the love of dominating from self-love, which, as was observed, is an infernal love, at first makes the feet, afterwards the soles of the feet, and, finally, is trodden under foot. These two loves, however, are with difficulty distinguished by man in the world, because their external forms are similar; yet they may be distinguished by this, that the celestial love is with those who approach the Lord, and live according to the precepts of the Decalogue; and that the infernal love is with those who do not approach the Lord, and who do not live according to the precepts of the Decalogue. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 502 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>502. "Quae spiritualiter vocatur Sodoma et Aegyptus," significat binos amores infernales, qui sunt amor dominandi ex amore sui, et amor regnandi ex fastu propriae intelligentiae, qui in Ecclesia sunt ubi non Unus Deus est, ac Dominus non colitur, et ubi non secundum praecepta Decalogi vivitur. - Per "Sodomam" in Sensu spirituali significatur amor dominandi ex amore sui, de quo sequitur, et per "Aegyptum" in Sensu spirituali significatur amor regnandi ex fastu propriae intelligentiae, de quo etiam sequitur; et quia illi bini amores significantur, ideo dicitur "spiritualiter Sodoma et Aegyptus." Quod illi amores sint in Ecclesia, ubi non unus Deus est, ac Dominus non colitur, et ubi non secundum praecepta Decalogi vivitur, est quia homo in binos illos amores nascitur, et in illos venit dum adolescit, et illi amores non removeri possunt, nisi a Deo Salvatore, et per vitam secundum praecepta Ipsius; et a Deo Salvatore non possunt nisi adeatur, nec vita secundum praecepta Ipsius datur, nisi homo ducatur ab Ipso; dari quidem potest, sed non vita in qua est aliquid Caeli et inde Ecclesiae: illa vita datur solum ab Ipso Qui est Vita.

Quod "Sodoma" sit amor dominandi ex amore sui, constare potest ex descriptione Sodomae apud Mosen, quod Angelis illuc venientibus voluerint violentiam inferre in domo Lothi; et quod ignis et sulphur e Caelo pluerint super illos, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_19_1" target=_top>Genesis 19:1</a>, seq.). Per "ignem et sulphur" ille amor cum ejus concupiscentiis significatur. Similia vidi, cum urbes et societates ex talibus die Ultimi Judicii eversae sunt, et illi dejecti in Infernum. Illi amores et illorum mala significantur per "Sodomam et Gomorrham" in his locis: <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_1_10" target=_top>Esaias 1:10</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_3_8-9" target=_top>3:8-9</a>; (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_13_1-22" target=_top>Esaias 13</a>:) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_13_19" target=_top>19</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_23_14" target=_top>Jeremias 23:14</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_49_18" target=_top>49:18</a>; <sup>1</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_50_37" target=_top>50:37</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_50_40" target=_top>40</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_lamentations_4_6" target=_top>Threni 4:6</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_16_46-50" target=_top>Ezechiel 16:46-50</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_amos_4_11" target=_top>Amos 4:11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zephaniah_2_9-10" target=_top>Zephanias 2:9-10</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_29_22" target=_top>Deuteronomius 29:22</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_29_2" target=_top>2</a>); <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_32_32" target=_top>32:32</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_10_14-15" target=_top>Matthaeus 10:14-15</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_11_23" target=_top>11:23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_6_11" target=_top>Marcus 6:11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_10_10-12" target=_top>Luca 10:10-12</a>; <sup>2</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_17_28-29" target=_top>17:28-29</a>. <p>Quod ille amor per "Sodomam" significetur, nescitur in mundo; sed retine hoc, et recordare, dum in Mundum spirituum, quod fit post mortem, venis, et plene confirmaberis. At sciendum est, quod sit amor dominandi ex amore sui, et amor dominandi ex amore usuum; hic amor est caelestis, ille autem infernalis: quare cum unus facit caput, alter facit pedes; hoc est, cum amor dominandi ex amore sui facit caput, tunc amor dominandi ex amore usuum, qui etiam est amor inserviendi proximo ex Domino, facit primum pedes, postea plantas pedum, et demum proculcatur; at vero cum amor dominandi ex amore usuum, qui, ut dictum, est amor caelestis, facit caput, tunc amor dominandi ex amore sui, qui, ut dictum, est amor infernalis, primum facit pedes, postea plantas pedum, et demum proculcatur. Sed bini illi amores in mundo ab homine aegre possunt distingui; causa est, quia externae formae illorum sunt similes; at dignoscuntur per id, quod caelestis ille amor sit apud illos qui adeunt Dominum et vivunt secundum praecepta Decalogi, et quod infernalis ille amor sit apud illos qui non adeunt Dominum et non vivunt secundum praecepta Decalogi.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;18 pro "17"<p>2.&nbsp;Lucas 10:10-12 pro "cap. 10:10, 11, 13" et cap. pro "Luc." </p>
