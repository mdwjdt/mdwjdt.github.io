align="center">灵义</h4><h4 align="center">整章内容</h4><p>本章论述了最后审判之后天堂与教会的状态；此后，新教会将通过新天堂而存在于地上，并单单敬拜主（1-8节）。它与主的结合（9，10节）。描述了它出于圣言的聪明（11节）；因而它的教义（12-21）；以及它的所有性质（22-26节）。</p><h4 align="center">各节内容</h4><p>第1节.“我又看见一个新天新地”表一个新天堂由主通过基督徒形成，如今被称作基督天堂，那些敬拜主，并照其圣言中的诫命生活，因而拥有仁与信的人就在该天堂；所有基督徒的婴孩也在这里（<a href="876.htm">876</a>节）。“因为先前的天和先前的地已经过去了”表不是由主，而是由那些从基督教界进入灵界的人所形成的天堂，这些天堂在最后审判之日都被驱散了（<a href="877.htm">877</a>节）。“海也不再有了”表由最初建立教会以来的基督徒所组成的天堂外在同样被驱散，不过这要等到那些写在主生命册上的人从那里被接出去，并得救之后（<a

href="883.htm">883</a>节）。</p><p>第4节.“神要擦去他们眼上一切的眼泪。不再有死亡，也不再有悲哀、哭号、疼痛，因为以前的事都过去了”表主将拿走他们心灵的一切悲伤，以及对罚入地狱、来自地狱的邪恶与虚假并它们所导致的试探的恐惧，他们必不记起它们，因为那使他们受尽苦难的龙已经被逐出去了（<a href="844.htm">844</a>-<a href="845.htm">845</a>节）。</p><p>第5节.“坐宝座的说，看哪！我将一切都更新了。又对我说，你要写上，因这些话是真实可信的”表最后审判完成后，主确认关于新天堂和新教会的一切（<a href="886.htm">886</a>节）。</p><p>第6节.“祂又对我说，都成了”表这是神性真理（<a href="887.htm">887</a>节）。“我是阿拉法和俄梅戛；是初和终”表主是天地之神，天上和地上的一切事物都是祂所造的，由祂的圣治掌管并照圣治成就（<a href="888.htm">888</a>节）。“我要将生命水的泉源白白赐给那口渴的人喝”表给那些出于属灵的功用而渴慕真理的人，即主将从祂自己通过圣言把有助于这种功用的一切事物都赐给他们（<a href="889.htm">889</a>节）。</p><p>第7节.“得胜的，必承受这些为业。我要作他的神，他要作我的儿子”表那些战胜自己里面的邪恶，也就是魔鬼，并且当受到巴比伦人和龙们的试探时没有屈服的人将进入天堂，在那里住在主里面，主也住在他们里面（<a href="890.htm">890</a>节）。</p><p>第8节.“惟有胆怯的、不忠的、可憎的”表那些没有处于信，也没有处于仁，因而陷入各种邪恶的人（<a href="891.htm">891</a>节）。“杀人的、淫乱的、行邪术的、拜偶像的和一切说谎话的”表所有无视十诫，没有避开其中所提到如罪的任何邪恶，因而活在它们当中的人（<a href="892.htm">892</a>节）。“他们的分就在烧着硫磺的火湖里”表他们拥有地狱，就是对虚假的爱和对邪恶的欲望所在之地（<a href="893.htm">893</a>节）。“这是第二次的死”表罚入地狱（<a href="894.htm">894</a>节）。</p><p>第9节.“拿着七个金香瓶、盛满末后七灾的七位天使中，有一位来同我说话，说，你来，我要将新妇，就是羔羊的妻，指示你”表来自主出于天堂至内层的流注和显明，是关于新教会的，新教会将通过圣言与主结合（<a href="895.htm">895</a>节）。</p><p>第10节.“我在灵里被那天使带到一座又大又高的山上，他将那大城，就是由神那里从天而降的圣耶路撒冷指示我”表约翰被提到第三层天堂，他的视觉被打开了，主的新教会教义以城的形式显现在他面前（<a href="896.htm">896</a>节）。</p><p>第11节.“城中有神的荣耀，城的光辉如同极贵的宝石，好像碧玉石，明如水晶”表在新教会，圣言将被理解，因为它将凭其灵义而变得透明（<a href="897.htm">897</a>节）。</p><p>第12节.“有高大的墙”表新教会的教义所来自的字义中的圣言（<a href="898.htm">898</a>节）。“有十二个门”表其中对真理与良善的一切认知，人凭这些认知被引入新教会（<a href="899.htm">899</a>节）。“门上有十二位天使，又有名字写在上头，就是以色列人十二支派的名字”表天上的神性真理与良善，也就是在这些认知里面的教会的神性真理与良善，它们会守卫，防止有人进入，除非他凭来自主的衍生物而在它们里面（<a href="900.htm">900</a>节）。</p><p>第13节.“东边有三门，北边有三门，南边有三门，西边有三门”表对真理与良善的认知，其中就有来自主出于天堂的属灵生命，被引入新教会也是凭着它们，这些认知是为了那些或多或少处于爱或对良善的情感之人，也为了那些或多或少处于智慧或对真理的情感之人（<a href="901.htm">901</a>节）。</p><p>第14节.“城墙有十二根基”表字义中的圣言包含新教会教义的全部事物（<a href="902.htm">902</a>节）。“根基上有羔羊十二使徒的名字”表来自圣言关于主和照其诫命生活的教义的全部事物（<a href="903.htm">903</a>节）。</p><p>第15节.“对我说话的，拿着金苇子，要量那城和城门、城墙”表主将理解和认识主的新教会在教义及其引入真理，以及它们所源自圣言上的性质的能力赐给那些处于爱之良善的人（<a href="904.htm">904</a>节）。</p><p>第16节.“城是四方的”表它里面的公正（<a href="905.htm">905</a>节）。“长宽一样大”表在新教会，良善与真理如本质与形式那样合而为一（<a href="906.htm">906</a>节）。“天使用苇子量那城，共有一万二千斯他丢；长、宽、高都是一样”表新教会出于教义的性质被显示，即其一切事物皆源于爱之良善（<a href="907.htm">907</a>，<a href="908.htm">908</a>节）。</p><p>第17节.“又量了城墙，共有一百四十四肘”表显示新教会中圣言的性质，其一切真理和良善皆源于圣言（<a href="909.htm">909</a>节）。“按着人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸”表新教会的性质，即它与天堂合而为一（<a href="910.htm">910</a>节）。</p><p>第18节.“墙的构造是碧玉的”表对新教会的人来说，圣言字义中的一切神性真理因灵义中的神性真理而透明（<a href="911.htm">911</a>节）。“城是精金的，如同明净的玻璃”表因而新教会的全部就是与来自主出于天堂的光一起流入的爱之良善（<a

href="915.htm">915</a>节）。</p><p>第21节.“十二个门是十二颗珍珠，每门是一颗珍珠”表对主的承认和认知将对源于圣言的真理与良善的一切认知结合为一体，并引入新教会（<a href="916.htm">916</a>节）。“城内的街道是精金，好像明透的玻璃”表新教会及其教义的一切事物在形式上是与来自主出于天堂的光一起流入的爱之良善（<a href="917.htm">917</a>节）。</p><p>第22节.“我未见城内有殿，因主神全能者和羔羊为城的殿”表新教会不会有任何脱离内在之物的外在之物，因为在其神性人中的主自己就是那被靠近、敬拜和爱慕的独一无二者，新教会的一切事物皆来自祂的神性人 （<a href="918.htm">918</a>节）。</p><p>第23节.“那城不需要日月照耀它，因有神的荣耀光照它，又有羔羊为城的灯”表新教会之人不会处于自我之爱和自己的聪明，因而不会单单处于属世之光，还将处于唯独来自主出于神性真理的属灵之光（<a href="919.htm">919</a>节）。</p><p>第24节.“得救的列族要在城的光里行走”表所有处于生活的良善，并信主的人都将在那里照神性真理生活，并在自己里面从内在看到它们，如同肉眼看到物体那样（<a href="920.htm">920</a>节）。“地上的君王必将自己的荣耀、尊贵归与那城”表所有处于源自属灵良善的智慧之真理的人都将在那里称谢主，并将他们所具有的一切真理和一切良善都归给祂（<a href="921.htm">921</a>节）。</p><p>第25节.“城门白昼总不关闭，在那里原没有黑夜”表那些处于来自主源于爱之良善的真理之人不断被接进新耶路撒冷，因为那里没有任何信之虚假（<a href="922.htm">922</a>节）。“他们必将列族的荣耀、尊贵归与那城”表那些进去的人将带来称谢、承认和信仰，即主是天地之神，教会的一切真理和宗教的一切良善皆来自祂（<a href="923.htm">923</a>节）。</p><p>第26节.“凡不洁净的，并那行可憎与虚谎之事的，总不得进那城”表那些玷污圣言的良善，歪曲圣言的真理，并出于确认，因而也出于虚假作恶的人无一被接进主的新教会（<a href="924.htm">924</a>节）。“只有名字写在羔羊生命册上的才得进去”表除了那些信主并照其圣言中的诫命生活之人外，其他人都不会被接进新教会，也就是新耶路撒冷。</p><h4 align="center">诠释</h4><p>876.启21:1.“我又看见一个新天新地”表一个新天堂由主通过基督徒形成，如今被称作基督天堂，那些敬拜主，并照其圣言中的诫命生活，因而拥有仁与信的人就在该天堂；所有基督徒的婴孩也在这里。“新天”和“新地”不是指肉眼所见的属世天堂，和世人所居的属世大地，而是指属灵的天堂，和该天堂之地，也就是天使所在之地。谁都明白并承认，所指的是这个天堂，以及该天堂之地，只要他在阅读圣言时，能在某种程度上从纯属世和物质观念中退出。显然，所指的是天使天堂，因为在接下来的这一节，经上说他“看见圣城新耶路撒冷由神那里从天而降，预备好了，就如新妇妆饰整齐，等候丈夫”，这句话的意思是教会降下来，而不是说什么耶路撒冷降下来；地上的教会由主那里从天使天堂而降，因为天堂天使和地上的世人在教会的一切事物上都合而为一（<a href="626.htm">626</a>节）。由此可见，那些出于这些话，以及本节接下来的话为自己捏造关于世界毁灭、万物更新教条的人曾经或现在的想法何等属世和物质化。</p><p>启示录前面，尤其14、15章有几次论述了这个新天堂。它之所以被称作基督天堂，是因为它不同于古天堂（ancient heavens），古天堂由主降世前的教会之人构成。这些古天堂在基督天堂之上；因为天堂就像广袤的穹苍，一个在另一个之上；每个天堂自身也被划分为三层天堂，即：至内层或第三层天，中间层或第二层天，最低层或第一层天，这个新天堂也是如此。我曾看见他们，并与他们交谈。自最初建立基督教会以来所有敬拜主，照其圣言中的诫命生活，因而从主通过圣言处于仁，同时处于信，由此未处于死信，而是处于活信的人都在这个新天堂。关于该天堂的各种事物，可参看前文（<a href="612.htm">612</a>，<a href="613.htm">613</a>，<a href="626.htm">626</a>，<a href="631.htm">631</a>，<a href="659.htm">659</a>，<a href="661.htm">661</a>，<a href="845.htm">845</a>，<a href="846.htm">846</a>，<a href="856.htm">856</a>节）。所有基督徒的婴孩也在这个新天堂，因为天使一直以教会的两大基本要素，即对主是天地之神的承认和遵行十诫的生活来教育他们。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 876</h4><p>876. REVELATION: CHAPTER 21<p>1. Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. And there was no more sea.<p>2. Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<p>3. And I heard a great voice from heaven saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. And He Himself will be with them their God.<p>4. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more toil (suffering), for the former things have passed away."<p>5. Then He who sat on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new." And He said to me, "Write, for these words are true and faithful."<p>6. And He said to me, "It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who thirsts I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely.<p>7. He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son.<p>8. But the fearful, faithless, and abominable, and murderers, the sexually licentious, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."<p>9. Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came to me and talked with me, saying, "Come, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife."<p>10. And he carried me away in the spirit onto a great and high mountain, and showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,<p>11. having the glory of God; and its light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, bright as crystal.<p>12. It had a great and high wall, and twelve gates, and over the gates twelve angels, with names written on them, which are those of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:<p>13. three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.<p>14. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<p>15. And he who talked with me had a gold reed to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.<p>16. The city is laid out as a square; its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed at twelve thousand furlongs. Its length, breadth, and height were equal.<p>17. Then he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.<p>18. The construction of its wall was of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.<p>19. The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kinds of precious stones: the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,<p>20. the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.<p>21. The twelve gates were twelve pearls: each gate was of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.<p>22. But I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.<p>23. The city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it, and the Lamb is its lamp.<p>24. And the nations that are saved shall walk in its light, and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honor into it.<p>25. Its gates shall not be shut by day, for there shall be no night there.<p>26. And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.<p>27. But there shall not enter it anything unclean, or that creates an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life.<p>THE SPIRITUAL MEANING<p>The Contents of the Whole Chapter<p>This chapter has as its subject the state of heaven and the church following the Last Judgment, that through the New Heaven, a New Church will afterward emerge on earth which will worship the Lord alone (verses <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">1-8</a>). Its conjunction with the Lord (verses <a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_10.htm">10</a>). A description of it as regards its intelligence gained from the Word (verse <a href="3927/revelation_21_11.htm">11</a>); as regards its consequent doctrine (verses <a href="3927/revelation_21_12.htm">12-21</a>); and as regards its whole character (verses <a href="3927/revelation_21_22.htm">22-26</a>).<p>The Contents of the Individual Verses:<p></p><table><thead><tr><th>Verse Contents</th><th>Spiritual Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth,</td><td>The Lord formed a new heaven out of Christians, which today is called the Christian heaven and is inhabited by people who worshiped the Lord and lived in accordance with His commandments in the Word, who consequently possess charity and faith. Found there also are all the little children of Christians.</td></tr><tr><td>for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away.</td><td>The heavens formed, not by the Lord, but by the people themselves who came into the spiritual world from the Christian world, all of which were dispersed at the time of the Last Judgment.</td></tr><tr><td>And there was no more sea.</td><td>The outer part of the heaven composed of Christians since the church was first established was likewise dispersed, after those who were written in the Lord's Book of Life were liberated from there and saved.</td></tr><tr><td>2.

Then He who sat on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new." And He said to me, "Write, for these words are true and faithful."</td><td>The Lord assuring them all as regards the New Heaven and the New Church after the Last Judgment was completed,</td></tr><tr><td>6.

This symbolically means that the Lord formed a new heaven out of Christians, which today is called the Christian heaven and is inhabited by people who worshiped the Lord and lived in accordance with His commandments in the Word, who consequently possess charity and faith. Found in that heaven also are all the little children of Christians.<p>The new heaven and new earth do not mean the natural heavens that are visible to our eyes or the natural earth inhabited by the human race. Rather they mean a spiritual heaven and the land of that heaven where angels dwell. That that heaven and the land of that heaven are meant is something everyone sees and acknowledges if only he can be drawn away from a purely natural and material idea when he reads the Word.<p>It is apparent that an angelic heaven is meant because we are told in the very next verse that John saw the holy city Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. This does not mean some Jerusalem coming down, but the church, and the church on earth descends from the Lord out of the angelic heaven, since angels in heaven and people on earth are united in everything having to do with the church (no. <a href="626.htm">626</a>).<p>It can be seen from this how naturally and materially some people have thought and continue to think who, from these words and those that follow in this verse, have fabricated for themselves the dogma regarding the destruction of the world and everything's being created anew.</p><p>[2] This new heaven was the subject several times before in the book of Revelation, especially in chapters 14, 15. It is called the Christian heaven, because it is apart from the ancient heavens which were constituted of people of the church before the Lord's advent. These ancient heavens are above the Christian heaven, for the heavens are like expanses, one above another. The same is the case with each of the heavens, for every heaven is in itself distinguished into three heavens - an inmost or third heaven, an intermediate or second heaven, and a lowest or first heaven. So with this new heaven. I have seen its inhabitants and spoken with them.<p>This new Christian heaven is inhabited by all those people who from the first establishment of the Christian Church have worshiped the Lord and lived in accordance with His commandments in the Word, and who consequently possess both charity and faith from the Lord through the Word, thus whose faith is not a lifeless one but a living one.<p>Regarding this heaven, see various mentions above, in nos. <a href="612.htm">612</a>, <a href="613.htm">613</a>, <a href="626.htm">626</a>, <a href="631.htm">631</a>, <a href="659.htm">659</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>, <a href="845.htm">845</a>, <a href="846.htm">846</a>, <a href="856.htm">856</a>.<p>Found in that heaven likewise are all the little children of Christians, because they are brought up by angels in the two essential elements of the church, namely an acknowledgment of the Lord as God of heaven and earth, and living in accordance with the Ten Commandments. </p>

And I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, signifies the New Church going to be set up by the Lord at the end of the former one, which [New Church] in companionship with the New Heaven will be in Divine truths as to both doctrine and life.<p>Prepared as a bride [adorned] for her husband, signifies that Church conjoined with the Lord by means of the Word.<p>3. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold God's tabernacle is with men, signifies the Lord out of love speaking and declaring the glad tidings that He Himself is now going to be present with men in His Divine Human.<p>And He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and He Himself shall be with them their God, signifies the Lord's conjunction, which is such that they are in Him, and He in them.<p>4.

And the One sitting upon the throne said, Behold I am making all things new, and He said unto me, Write, for these words are true and trustworthy, signifies the Lord confirming all concerning the New Heaven and the New Church after the last judgment has been completed.<p>6.

But as for the fearful and the untrustworthy and the abominable, signifies those who are in no faith, and in no charity, and consequently are in all kinds of evils.<p>And murderers, and whoremongers, and enchanters, and idolaters, and [all] liars, signifies all those who make the precepts of the Decalogue of no account, and do not flee from any of the evils there mentioned as sins, and therefore live in them.<p>Their part is in the lake burning with fire and sulphur, signifies theirs is the hell where are the loves of untruth and the lusts of evil.<p>Which is the second death, signifies damnation.<p>9. And there came unto me one of the seven angels having the seven phials full of the seven last plagues, and spoke with me saying, Come, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife, signifies an influx and making manifest from the Lord out of the inmost of heaven concerning the New Church, which will be conjoined to the Lord by means of the Word.<p>10.

Having the glory of God, and the light thereof like a most precious stone as it were a jasper stone shining crystal clear, signifies that in that Church the Word will be understood, because it will be transparent by virtue of its spiritual sense.<p>12. Having a great and high wall, signifies the Word in the sense of the letter from which the doctrine of the New Church will be derived.<p>Having twelve gates, signifies all the cognitions of truth and good there by means of which a man is introduced into the Church.<p>And over the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon which are those of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel, signifies the Divine truths and goods of heaven, which also are the Divine truths and goods of the Church, in those cognitions, and guards lest anyone should enter unless he be in them by derivation from the Lord (ex Domino).<p>13. Towards the east three gates, towards the north three gates, towards the south three gates, and towards the west three gates, signifies that the cognitions of truth and good, in which they have spiritual life out of heaven from the Lord, by means of which introduction into the New Church is effected, are for those who are in the love or affection of good, [some] more and [some] less, and for those who are in the wisdom or affection of truth, [some] more and [some] less.<p>14.

And the city has no need of the sun and the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God has enlightened it, and the lamp thereof is the Lamb, signifies that the men of that Church will not be in the love of self and in self-derived intelligence (in propria intelligentia), and consequently in natural light only, but in spiritual light out of the Divine truth of the Word from the Only Lord.<p>24.

And there shall not enter into it any unclean thing, nor one doing abomination and a lie, signifies that no one is received into the Lord's New Church who adulterates the goods and falsifies the truths of the Word, and who does evils from confirmation and thus also untruths.<p>But only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life, signifies that no others are received into the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, but those who believe in the Lord and live in accordance with His precepts in the Word.<p>THE EXPOSITION<p>[verse 1] 'And I saw a new heaven and a new land' signifies that by the Lord a new heaven has been formed out of Christians, which at this day is called the Christian heaven, where those are who had worshipped the Lord and lived in accordance with His precepts in the Word, who consequently have charity and faith; in which heaven are all the little children of Christians. By 'a new heaven' and by 'a new land' is understood neither the natural heaven visible before the eyes, nor the natural land inhabited by men, but a spiritual heaven and the land of that heaven, where there are angels. That this heaven and the land of this heaven is understood everyone sees and acknowledges, provided that he can be withdrawn in some measure from a purely natural and material idea when he is reading the Word. It is plain that the angelic heaven is understood, because in the verse immediately following it is said that he 'saw the holy city Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.' By this there is not understood any Jerusalem coming down, but the Church; and the Church on earth (in terris) comes down from the Lord out of the angelic heaven because the angels of heaven and the men of the earth in all the things of the Church make one (<a href="626.htm">626</a>). From these considerations it can be seen how naturally and materially those have thought and do think, who out of these words and the ones following in this verse have contrived for themselves a dogmatic tenet about the destruction of the world and about a new creation of all things.</p><p>[2] This new heaven has been treated of several times in the Apocalypse, especially in chapters <a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">14</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_15_1.htm">15</a>. It is called the Christian heaven because it is distinct from the ancient heavens, which came into existence from the men of the Church before the Lord's coming. These ancient heavens are above the Christian heaven; for the heavens are like expanses, one above another. The case is similar with each heaven, for each heaven by itself is distinguished into three heavens, an inmost or third, a middle or second, and a lowest or first. Likewise in the case of this New Heaven. I have seen them and I have spoken with them. In this new Christian heaven are all those who from the first establishment of the Christian Church have worshipped the Lord and lived in accordance with His precepts in the Word, and who consequently have been in charity and faith together from the Lord by means of the Word, thus who are not in a dead but a living faith. Concerning this heaven various things may be seen above (<a href="612.htm">612-613</a>, <a href="626.htm">626</a>, <a href="631.htm">631</a>, <a href="659.htm">659</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>, <a href="845.htm">845-846</a>, <a href="856.htm">856</a>). In that heaven there are as well all the little children of Christians, because they have been educated by angels in the two Essentials of the Church, which are the acknowledgment of the Lord as the God of heaven and earth, and a life in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Plural of stadium=approx. one-eighth of a mile. </p>

"And the city lieth foursquare" signifies justice in it, (<a href="905.htm">905</a>). "The length thereof is as large as the breadth" signifies that good and truth in that church make one, like essence and form, (<a href="906.htm">906</a>). "And he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand stadia, the length and the breadth and the height of it were equal" signifies the quality of that church from doctrine shown, that all things of it were from the good of love, (<a href="907.htm">907</a>, <a href="908.htm">908</a>).<p>Verse 17.

"And I saw no temple therein; for the Lord God Almighty is the temple of it and the Lamb" signifies that in this church there will not be any external separated from the internal, because the Lord Himself in His Divine Human, from whom is the all of the church, is alone approached, worshiped, and adored, (<a href="918.htm">918</a>).<p>Verse 23.

"And there shall not enter into it any unclean thing and that doeth abomination and a lie" signifies that no one is received into the Lord's New Church who adulterates the goods and falsifies the truths of the Word, and who does evils from confirmation and thus also falsities, (<a href="924.htm">924</a>[1-2]); but they that are written in the Lamb's book of life" signifies that no others will be received into the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, but they who believe in the Lord, and live according to His commandments in the Word, (<a href="925.htm">925</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original Latin omits "adorned."<br><br>THE EXPLANATION, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>)<p>Verse 1. And I saw a New Heaven and a New Earth, signifies that a New Heaven was formed from Christians by the Lord, which at this day is called the Christian Heaven, where they are who had worshiped the Lord and had lived according to His commandments in the Word, in whom therefore there is charity and faith; in which heaven also are all the infants of Christians. By "a New Heaven and a New Earth" is not meant the natural heaven visible to the eyes, nor the natural earth inhabited by men, but the spiritual heaven is meant, and the earth belonging to that heaven, where the angels are. That this heaven and the earth of this heaven is meant, everyone may see and acknowledge, if he can in some measure be withdrawn from a purely natural and material idea, when he reads the Word. That the angelic heaven is meant is evident, because it is said in the next verse, that "he saw the holy city Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her Husband," by which is not meant any Jerusalem coming down, but the church, and the church on earth comes down from the Lord out of the angelic heaven, because the angels of heaven and the men on earth in all things of the church make one, (<a href="626.htm">626</a>). From these things it may be seen, how naturally and materially they have thought and do think, who, from these words and those which follow in the same verse, have fabricated for themselves the dogma about the destruction of the world, and of the new creation of all things.</p><p><p>[2] This New Heaven is occasionally treated of above in Revelation (especially in chapters 14, 15). It is called the Christian Heaven, because it is distinct from the ancient heavens, which existed from the men of the church before the Lord's coming. These ancient heavens are above the Christian Heaven; for the heavens are like expanses, one above another; it is the same with each particular heaven; for each heaven by itself is distinguished into three heavens, an inmost or third, a middle or second, and a lowest or first, and so it is with this New Heaven; I have seen them and have spoken with them. In this New Christian Heaven are all those who, from the first establishment of the Christian Church, worshiped the Lord, and lived according to His commandments in the Word, and who, therefore, were in charity, and at the same time in faith from the Lord through the Word, thus who were not in a dead but in a living faith. Various things respecting this heaven may be seen above, (<a href="612.htm">612</a>, <a href="613.htm">613</a>, <a href="626.htm">626</a>, <a href="631.htm">631</a>, <a href="659.htm">659</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>, <a href="845.htm">845</a>, <a href="846.htm">846</a>, <a href="856.htm">856</a>). In that heaven likewise are all the infants of Christians, because they are educated by the angels in those two essentials of the church, which are the acknowledgment of the Lord as the God of heaven and earth, and a life according to the commandments of the Decalogue. </p>

CAPUT XXI. <p>ET vidi Caelum novum et Terram novam, quia prius Caelum et prior Terra transiit; et Mare non erat amplius. <p>2. Et ego Johannes vidi urbem sanctam Hierosolymam Novam, descendentem a Deo e Caelo, paratam sicut Sponsam ornatam Marito Suo. <p>3. Et audivi vocem magnam e Caelo dicentem, Ecce Tabernaculum Dei cum hominibus, et habitabit cum illis, et illi populi Ipsius erunt, et Ipse erit cum illis Deus illorum 4. Et absterget Deus omnem lachrymam ex oculis eorum, et mors non erit amplius, neque luctus, neque clamor, neque labor (aerumna), non erit amplius; quia priora transiverunt. <p>5. Et dixit Sedens super Throno, Ecce nova omnia facio: et dixit mihi, Scribe, quia haec Verba vera et fida sunt. <p>6. Et dixit mihi, Factum est; Ego sum Alpha et Omega, Principium et Finis; Ego sitienti dabo ex fonte aquae vitae gratis. <p>7. Vincens haereditario possidebit omnia; et ero illi Deus, et ille erit Mihi filius. <p>8. Timidis autem, et infidis, et abominabilibus, et homicidis, et scortatoribus, et incantatoribus, et idololatris, et omnibus mendacibus, pars illorum in stagno ardente igne et sulphure; quae est altera mors. <p>9. Et venit ad me unus septem Angelorum habentium septem phialas plenas Septem plagis ultimis, et locutus est mecum, dicens, Veni, ostendam tibi Sponsam Agni Uxorem. <p>10. Et abstulit me in spiritu super montem magnum et altum, et ostendit mihi urbem magnam sanctam Hierosolymam, descendentem e CaelO a Deo: <p>11.

Habentem murum magnum et altum, habentem portas duodecim, et super portis angelos duodecim, et nomina superscripta, quae sunt duodecim tribuum filiorum Israelis: <p>13.

Et murus urbis habens fundamenta duodecim, et in illis nomina duodecim apostolorum Agni. <p>15. Et loquens cum me habebat calamum aureum, ut metiretur urbem et portas ejus et murum ejus. <p>16. Et urbs quadrangularis sita est, et longitudo ejus tanta est quanta et latitudo: et mensus est urbem calamo ad stadia duodecies mille; longitudo et latitudo et altitudo ejus aequalia erant. <p>17. Et mensus est murum ejus, centum quadraginta quatuor cubitorum, mensura hominis quae est Angeli. <p>18. Et erit structura muri ejus jaspis, et <sup>1</sup>urbs aurum purum simile vitro puro. <p>19. Et fundamenta muri urbis omni lapide pretioso exornata: fundamentum primum jaspis, secundum sapphirus, tertium chalcedonius, quartum smaragdus, <p>20. Quintum sardonyx, sextum sardius, septimum chrysolithus, octavum beryllus, nonum topazius, decimum chrysoprasus, undecimum hyacinthus, duodecimum amethystus. <p>21. Et duodecim portae duodecim margaritae; unaquaevis portarum erat ex una margarita; et platea urbis aurum purum tanquam vitrum pellucidum. <p>22. Et templum non vidi in ea, quia Dominus Deus Omnipotens Templum ejus est et Agnus. <p>23. Et urbs non opus habet sole, neque luna, ut luceant in ea; quia Gloria Dei illustravit eam, et Lucerna ejus Agnus. <p>24. Et gentes quae salvantur in luce ejus ambulabunt, et reges terrae afferent gloriam et honorem Suum in illam. <p>25. Et portae ejus non claudentur interdiu, nox enim non erit ibi; et afferent gloriam et honorem gentium in illam. <p>26.

"Et vidi Caelum novum et Terram novam," significat quod a Domino novum Caelum ex Christianis formatum sit, quod hodie vocatur Caelum Christianum, ubi sunt qui Dominum coluerant, et secundum praecepta Ipsius in Verbo vixerant, quibus inde est charitas et fides; in quo Caelo etiam sunt omnes infantes Christianorum. - Per "Caelum novum" et per "Terram novam," non intelligitur caelum naturale coram oculis aspectabile, nec terra naturalis ab hominibus habitata, sed intelligitur Caelum spirituale et Terra illius Caeli, ubi sunt angeli; quod hoc Caelum et hujus Caeli Terra intelligatur, quisque videt et agnoscit, si modo aliquantum abduci potest ab idea pure naturali et materiali, cum legit Verbum. Quod Caelum angelicum intelligatur, patet, quia in versu mox sequente dicitur, quod viderit "urbem sanctam Hierosolymam descendentem a Deo e Caelo, paratam sicut Sponsam ornatam Marito suo," per quam non intelligitur aliqua Hierosolyma descendens, sed Ecclesia; et Ecclesia in terris descendit a Domino e Caelo angelico, quia angeli Caeli et homines telluris in omnibus Ecclesiae unum faciunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_876/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_626" target=_top>626</a>). Ex his videri potest, quam naturaliter et materialiter cogitaverunt et cogitant, qui ex his verbis et ex sequentibus in hoc versu sibi finxerunt dogmaticum de interitu mundi, et de nova creatione omnium. De hoc Caelo Novo actum est supra aliquoties in Apocalypsi (imprimis in cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_876/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_14_1-20" target=_top>14</a> et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_876/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_15_1-8" target=_top>15</a>). Vocatur Caelum Christianum, quia distinctum est a Caelis antiquis, qui ab hominibus Ecclesiae ante Adventum Domini exstiterunt. Hi antiqui Caeli sunt supra Caelum Christianum; Caeli enim sunt sicut expansa, unum supra alterum: similiter unumquodvis Caelum; unumquodvis enim Caelum per se distinguitur in tres Caelos, intimum seu tertium, medium seu secundum, ac infimum seu primum; similiter hoc novum Caelum; vidi illos et locutus sum cum illis. In novo hoc Caelo Christiano sunt omnes qui ab Ecclesiae Christianae prima instauratione coluerunt Dominum, et vixerunt secundum praecepta Ipsius in Verbo, et inde qui a Domino per Verbum in charitate et simul fide fuerunt, ita qui non in fide mortua sed in fide viva. De hoc Caelo videantur varia supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_876/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_612" target=_top>612</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_876/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_613" target=_top>613</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_876/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_626" target=_top>626</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_876/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_631" target=_top>631</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_876/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_659" target=_top>659</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_876/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_661" target=_top>661</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_876/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_845" target=_top>845</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_876/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_846" target=_top>846</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_876/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_856" target=_top>856</a>). Pariter in illo Caelo sunt omnes infantes Christianorum, quia ab angelis educati in duo illa Essentialia Ecclesiae, quae sunt Agnitio Domini pro Deo Caeli et Terrae, ac Vita secundum praecepta Decalogi.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;et pro "at"<p>2.&nbsp;Vers. pro "n." </p>
