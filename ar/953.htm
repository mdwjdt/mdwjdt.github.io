<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第953节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>953.启22:16.“我耶稣差遣我的使者在众教会将这些事向你们证明”表主在整个基督教界面前证明：唯独主显明本书所描述的事，如现在所披露的那些事一样，这是千真万确的。主在此之所以自称“耶稣”，是因为基督教界所有人都知道，曾在世间的主自己显明本书所描述的事，如现在所披露的那些事一样。“差遣使者证明”表示从主那里证明这是千真万确的；诚然，是天使证明了这事，然而他不是凭自己，而是凭主证明的，这从这些话很清楚地看出来：“证明这些事的说，是了，我必快来”（｛21:20）；这句话之所以表示这是千真万确的，是因为“证明”论及真理，真理为自己作见证，主就是真理（<a href="6.htm">6</a>，<a href="16.htm">16</a>，<a href="490.htm">490</a>节）。“证明”不仅表示证明这是千真万确的，即主向约翰显明本书所描述的事，还表示祂现在已经显明其中的每一个及一切事物表示什么；“证明”尤其表示这一点，因为经上说“祂在众教会将这些事证明”，也就是说，约翰所看到并描述的事所包含的内容都是真的，因为“证明”论及真理，如前所述。“在众教会将这些事向你们”表示在整个基督教界面前，因为此处所指的众教会在基督教界。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 953</h4><p>953. <a href="3927/revelation_22_16.htm">22:16</a> "I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things in the churches." This symbolizes a testification by the Lord before the whole Christian world of the truth that the Lord alone has presented the visions described in this book, and that their meaning is now disclosed.<p>The Lord here calls Himself Jesus in order that people throughout the Christian world may know that the Lord who was in the world is Himself the one who has presented the visions described in this book, whose meanings have now been revealed. Sending an angel to testify symbolizes a testification by the Lord that something is true. The angel, indeed, testified to it, but he did so not of himself, but from the Lord, as is clearly apparent from the declaration in verse <a href="3927/revelation_22_20.htm">20</a> below, "He who testifies to these things says, 'Surely I am coming quickly.'"<p>It is a testification that something is true because testifying is a term used in connection with truth, since truth bears witness of itself, and the Lord is the embodiment of truth (nos. <a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="16.htm">16</a>, <a href="490.htm">490</a>). To testify here symbolically means to testify not only that it is true that the Lord presented to John the visions described in this book, but also that He has now presented what they individually and collectively symbolize. This is properly what is meant by testifying, for we are told that the angel testified these things in the churches, which is to say that the meanings contained in things seen and described by John are true. For He testified concerning the truth, as we said.<p>"To testify to you these things in the churches" symbolically means before the whole Christian world, because that is where the churches meant here are found. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 953</h4><p>953. [verse 16] 'I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify unto you these things in the Churches' signifies a testification by the Lord before the whole of Christendom, that it is true that the Only Lord has made manifest the things that have been described in this book, as also those that have now been opened. The reason why the Lord here names Himself 'Jesus' is so that all in Christendom may know that the Lord Himself Who was in the world, has made manifest the things that have been described in this book, as also those that have now been opened. By 'to send an angel to testify' is signified a testification by the Lord that it is true. In fact the angel testified this, yet not from himself but from the Lord, which is clearly evident in verse 20 following, from these words:<p>The One testifying these things says, Indeed I am coming quickly.<p>The reason why it is a testification that it is true is because 'to testify' is said concerning the truth (veritas), since the truth (veritas) testifies of itself (ex se), and the Lord is the Truth (veritas) (<a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="16.htm">16</a>, <a href="490.htm">490</a>). 'To testify' signifies not only to make a testification that it is true that the Lord has made manifest to John the things that have been described in this book, but also that He has now made manifest what all the things there collectively and separately signify. This is properly understood by 'to testify,' for it is said that He testifies these things in the Churches, that is, that the things are true that are contained in the things seen and described by John; for 'to testify' is said of the truth (veritas), as was said. By 'unto you these things in the Churches' is signified before the whole of Christendom, because there are the Churches that are understood here. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 953</h4><p>953. Verse 16. I Jesus have sent My angel to testify unto you these things in the churches, signifies a testification from the Lord before the whole Christian world, that it is true that the Lord alone made manifest the things which are described in this book, as also the things which are now laid open. The reason why the Lord here names Himself "Jesus," is, that all in the Christian world may know that the Lord Himself, who was in the world, manifested the things which are described in this book, as also the things which are now laid open. By "sending an angel to testify," is signified testification from the Lord that it is true; an angel, indeed, did testify this, yet not from himself, but from the Lord, which appears clearly (in verse 20), from these words, "He who testifieth these things saith, Surely, I come quickly;" the reason why it means a testification that it is true, is because "to testify" is said of the truth, since truth testifies of itself, and the Lord is the truth, (<a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="16.htm">16</a>, <a href="490.htm">490</a>). "To testify" not only signifies testification that it is true, that the Lord manifested to John the things which are described in this book, but also that He has now manifested what each and all the things therein signify; this is especially meant by "testifying," for it is said that "He testifies these things in the churches," that is, that the things are true which are contained in what was seen and described by John, for "to testify" is said of the truth, as before observed. By "unto you these things in the churches," is signified before the whole Christian world, for there the churches are, which are here meant. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 953 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>953. (Vers. 16.) "Ego Jesus misi Angelum Meum testari vobis haec in Ecclesiis," significat testificationem a Domino coram toto Christiano Orbe, quod verum sit quod Solus Dominus manifestaverit illa quae in hoc Libro descripta sunt, ut et quae nunc aperta sunt. -Quod Dominus Se hic nominet "Jesum," est, ut omnes in Orbe Christiano sciant quod Ipse Dominus, Qui fuit in mundo, illa quae in hoc Libro descripta sunt, ut et quae nunc aperta sunt, manifestaverit; per "mittere Angelum testari" significatur testificatio a Domino quod verum sit; Angelus quidem id testatus est, verum non a se sed a Domino, quod patet clare (in vers. 20 sequente) ab his, "Dicit Testans haec, Etiam venio cito;" quod sit testificatio quod verum sit, est quia "testari" dicitur de veritate, quoniam veritas testatur ex se, et Dominus est Veritas (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_953/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6" target=_top>6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_953/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_16" target=_top>16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_953/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490" target=_top>490</a>). "Testari" non modo significat testificari quod verum sit quod Dominus manifestaverit Johanni illa quae in hoc Libro descripta sunt, sed etiam quod nunc manifestaverit quid omnia et singula ibi significant; hoc intelligitur proprie per "testari," nam dicitur quod "testetur haec in Ecclesiis," hoc est, quod vera sint quae in visis et descriptis a Johanne continentur; "testari" enim dicitur de veritate, ut dictum est: per "vobis haec in Ecclesiis" significatur coram toto Orbe Christiano, quia ibi sunt Ecclesiae, quae hic intelliguntur. </p>
