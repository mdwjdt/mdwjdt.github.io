<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第890节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>890.启21:7.“得胜的，必承受这些为业。我要作他的神，他要作我的儿子”表那些战胜自己里面的邪恶，也就是魔鬼，并且当受到巴比伦人和龙们的试探时没有屈服的人将进入天堂，在那里住在主里面，主也住在他们里面。“得胜的”在此表示战胜自己里面的邪恶，也就是魔鬼，并且当受到巴比伦人和龙们的试探时不会屈服。之所以说战胜自己里面的邪恶，也就是战胜魔鬼，是因为“魔鬼”表示一切邪恶。“承受这些为业”表示进入天堂，并拥有那里来自主的良善，从而进入来自主并属于主的良善，如儿子和继续者那样，天堂因此被称为“产业”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.29.htm">19:29</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.34.htm">25:34</a>）。“我要作他的神，他要作我的儿子”表示在天上，他们将在主里面，主也在他们里面，如前所述（<a href="882.htm">882</a>，<a href="883.htm">883</a>节），那里有同样的话，只是那里说“他们要作祂的子民；祂要亲自与他们同在，作他们的神”。那些直接靠近主的人之所以成为祂的儿子，是因为他们从主新生，也就是重生，主因此称祂的门徒为“儿子”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.36.htm">12:36</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.33.htm">13:33</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约21.5.htm">21:5</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 890</h4><p>890. <a href="3927/revelation_21_7.htm">21:7</a> "He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son." This symbolically means that people who overcome the evils, that is, the Devil, in themselves, and do not succumb when tempted by adherents of Babylon or followers of the dragon, shall enter into heaven and dwell there in the Lord and have the Lord in them.<p>To overcome here means to overcome evils, that is, the Devil, in oneself, and not to succumb when tempted by adherents of Babylon or followers of the dragon. To overcome evils in oneself is also to overcome the Devil, because the Devil means all evil. To inherit all things means, symbolically, to enter heaven and to possess then the goods that are in it from the Lord, thus to possess, as a son and heir, goods received from the Lord which are the Lord's. Heaven is therefore called an inheritance in <a href="3927/matthew_19_29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a> and <a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">25:34</a>.<p>"I will be his God and he shall be My son" means, symbolically, that in heaven these people will be in the Lord and have the Lord in them, as in no. <a href="883.htm">883</a> above where a similar statement is found, only there it says that they shall be His people, and He Himself will be with them their God.<p>People who turn directly to the Lord are His children because they are born anew from Him, that is to say, regenerated or reborn. Therefore the Lord called His disciples children (<a href="3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>; <a href="3927/john_13_33.htm">13:33</a>; <a href="3927/john_21_5.htm">21:5</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 890</h4><p>890. [verse 7] 'He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be God to him, and he shall be a son to Me' signifies that those who overcome the evils with themselves, that is, the devil, and do not yield when they are being tempted by the Babylonians and the dragonists, are going to come into heaven and live there in the Lord and the Lord in them. By 'to overcome' here is understood to overcome the evils with themselves, thus the devil, and not to yield when they are being tempted by the Babylonians and the dragonists. The reason why to overcome the evils with themselves is also to overcome the devil is because by 'the devil' is understood all evil. By 'to inherit all things' is signified to come into heaven and to come then into possession of the goods that are there from the Lord, thus into the goods that are from the Lord and of the Lord, as a son and heir, heaven being therefore called an inheritance (<a href="3927/matthew_19_29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">25:34</a>). By 'I will be God to him and he shall be a son to Me' is signified that in heaven they will be in the Lord and the Lord will be in them, as above (<a href="883.htm">883</a>) where similar [words occur], except that there it is said that 'they shall be His people, and He Himself shall be with them their God.' The reason why those who approach the Lord directly are His sons is because they have been born anew from Him, that is, regenerated, for which reason He called His disciples 'sons' (<a href="3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>; <a href="3927/john_13_33.htm">13:33</a>; <a href="3927/john_21_5.htm">21:5</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 890</h4><p>890. Verse 7. He that overcometh shall possess as an inheritance all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be My son, signifies that they who overcome evils in themselves, that is, the devil, and do not succumb when they are tempted by the Babylonians and dragonists, will come into heaven, and there live in the Lord and the Lord in them. By "overcoming" is here meant to overcome evils in themselves, thus the devil, and not to succumb when they are tempted by the Babylonians and dragonists. The reason why to overcome evils in oneself is also to overcome the devil, is because by the "devil" is meant all evil; by "to possess as an inheritance all things," is signified to come into heaven, and then to enjoy the possession of the goods which are there from the Lord, consequently to enter into the goods which are from the Lord and of the Lord, as a son and heir, whence heaven is called an inheritance, (<a href="3927/matthew_19_29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">25:34</a>). "I will be his God and he shall be My son," signifies that in heaven they will be in the Lord and the Lord in them, as above, (<a href="882.htm">882</a>, <a href="883.htm">883</a>), where the like words occur, only that it is there said, that "they shall be His people, and He will be their God." The reason why they who immediately approach the Lord, are called His sons, is because they are born anew from Him, that is, regenerated, wherefore He called His disciples "sons" (<a href="3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>; <a href="3927/john_13_33.htm">13:33</a>; <a href="3927/john_21_5.htm">21:5</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 890 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>890. (Vers. 7.) "Vincens haereditario possidebit omnia; et ero illi Deus, et ille erit Mihi filius," significat quod qui vincunt mala apud se, hoc est, Diabolum, et non succumbunt cum tentantur a Babyloniis et Draconicis, in Caelum venturi sint, et ibi victuri in Domino et Dominus in illis. -Per "vincere" hic intelligitur vincere mala apud se, ita Diabolum, et non succumbere cum tentantur a Babyloniis et Draconicis; quod vincere mala apud se sit etiam vincere Diabolum, est quia per "Diabolum" intelligitur omne malum; per "haereditario possidere omnia" significatur venire in Caelum, et tunc in possessionem bonorum quae ibi sunt a Domino, ita in bona quae a Domino ac Domini sunt, ut filius haeres; vocatur inde Caelum haereditas, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_890/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_19_29" target=_top>Matthaeus 19:29</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_890/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_25_34" target=_top>25:34</a>); per "ero illi Deus, et ille erit Mihi filius" significatur quod in Caelo erunt in Domino et Dominus erit in illis, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_890/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_882" target=_top>882</a>(, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_890/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_883" target=_top>883</a>)), ubi similia; modo quod ibi dicatur quod "illi populi Ipsius erunt, et Ipse erit cum illis Deus illorum." Quod illi qui Dominum immediate adeunt, sint Ipsius filii, est quia illi e novo nati sunt ab Ipso, hoc est, regenerati; quare Discipulos Suos vocabat "filios," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_890/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_36" target=_top>Johannes 12:36</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_890/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_13_33" target=_top>13:33</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_890/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_21_5" target=_top>21:5</a>). </p>
