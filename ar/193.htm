<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第193节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>193.“我又要将我神的名写在他上面”表神性真理必刻在他们心上。 “写”在人上面表铭刻，好让它能在他里面，如同他自己的；“我神的名”则表神性真理。对于“我神”是指神性真理，有必要在此说明一下。在旧约圣言，提及“耶和华神”的地方多得数不清，有时单提“耶和华”，有时单提“神”。其中“耶和华”表主的神性良善，“神”表主的神性真理。或也可说，“耶和华”表主的神性之爱，“神”表主的神性智慧。这两种称谓并用，是为了存在于圣言一切细节中的天堂婚姻，也就是爱与智慧的婚姻，或良善与真理的良善，关于该婚姻，可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/80.htm">80</a>-90节）一书。</p><p>但在新约圣言，经上不说“耶和华神”，而说“主神”。因为主也表神性良善或神性之爱，和“耶和华”一样。由此明显可知，“我神的名”表主的神性真理。当论及主时，“名”是指藉以敬拜祂的一切（参看<a href="81.htm">81</a>节）。藉以敬拜祂的一切，都与神性良善并神性真理有关。鉴于没有人知道主的这些话是什么意思，即：</p><p>父啊，荣耀你的名。当时就有声音从天上来说，我已经荣耀了我的名，还要再荣耀。（约翰福音12: 28）</p><p>故应做出说明。主在世时，使祂的人性成为神性真理，也就是圣言；离世以后，又将神性真理与成孕以来就在祂里面的神性良善完全联结起来。因为主荣耀了祂的人性，也就是使它变成神性，正如祂使人变得属灵那样。因为祂首先将圣言的真理引入人里面，然后将它们与良善联结起来，人凭这种联结而变得属灵。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 193</h4><p>193. "'And I will write on him the name of My God.'" This symbolically means that they will have Divine truth engraved on their hearts.<p>To engrave something on someone means, symbolically, to engrave it on him so that it is in him as something his own, and the name of My God symbolizes Divine truth.<p>Here we must say something about My God's being Divine truth. In countless places the Word of the Old Testament uses the name Jehovah God, and also the two terms separately, saying sometimes Jehovah, sometimes God; and Jehovah means the Lord in respect to Divine good, while God means the Lord in respect to Divine truth. Or to say the same thing, Jehovah means the Lord in respect to Divine love, and God means the Lord in respect to Divine wisdom. Both terms are used because of the heavenly marriage in every part of the Word, which is a marriage of love and wisdom or a marriage of goodness and truth. Concerning this marriage, see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="../ss/80.htm">80-90</a>.</p><p>[2] The Word of the New Testament does not use the name Jehovah God, but instead Lord God, for like Jehovah, the term Lord symbolizes Divine good or Divine love.<p>It can be seen from this that the name of My God symbolizes the Lord's Divine truth.<p>A name, when used of the Lord, means everything by which He is worshiped, as may be seen no. <a href="81.htm">81</a> above, and everything by which He is worshiped has some relation to Divine good and Divine truth.<p>Because people do not know the meaning of these words of the Lord, "'Father, glorify Your name,' and a voice came from heaven, saying, 'I have both glorified it and will glorify it again,'" <sup>1</sup>therefore we will say what they mean. When the Lord was in the world, He made His humanity the embodiment of Divine truth, which is also the Word, and when He departed from the world, He fully united the Divine truth to the Divine good that He had in Him from conception. For the Lord glorified His humanity, or made it Divine, in the same way that He makes a person spiritual. That is, He first instills in a person truths from the Word, and afterward unites these to goodness, and by that union makes the person spiritual.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="3927/john_12_28.htm">John 12:28</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 193</h4><p>193. 'And I will write upon him the Name of My God' signifies that Divine Truth shall be inscribed on their hearts. 'To write upon' anyone signifies to inscribe so that it may be in him as though his; and 'the Name of My God' signifies Divine Truth. Here something shall be said of the fact that 'My God' is Divine Truth. In the Word of the Old Testament in innumerable places JEHOVAH GOD is mentioned, as also separately sometimes JEHOVAH and sometimes GOD, and by 'JEHOVAH' is understood the Lord as to Divine Good, and by 'GOD' the Lord as to Divine Truth, or, what is the same, by 'JEHOVAH' is understood the Lord as to Divine Love, and by 'GOD' the Lord as to Divine Wisdom, and each of them is mentioned on account of the heavenly marriage in the details of the Word. This is a marriage of Love and Wisdom, or a marriage of good and truth, concerning which marriage [something] may be seen in <a href="../ss/80.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 80-90</a>.</p><p>[2] In the Word of the New Testament, however, 'Jehovah God' is not mentioned, but 'Lord God,' for 'Lord,' like 'Jehovah,' signifies Divine Good or Divine Love. From these [considerations] it can be established that by 'the Name of My God' is signified the Lord's Divine Truth. That 'Name,' when said of the Lord, is everything by means of which He is worshipped may be seen above (<a href="81.htm">81</a>); and everything by means of which He is worshipped relates to Divine Good and Divine Truth. As it is not known what is understood by these words of the Lord:<p>Father, glorify Thy Name; and there came a voice out of heaven, I have glorified it, and will glorify it again. <a href="3927/john_12_28.htm">John 12:28</a>, it shall be stated. When the Lord was in the world He made His Human Divine Truth, which also is the Word; and when He went out of the world He fully united Divine Truth to the Divine Good that was in Him from conception; for the Lord glorified His Human, that is, made it Divine, as He makes a man spiritual; for first He imparts truths out of the Word to the man, and afterwards He unites them to good, and by means of that uniting the man is made spiritual. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 193</h4><p>193. And I will write upon him the name of My God signifies that the Divine truth will be written in their hearts. "To write" upon anyone signifies to inscribe, so that it may be in him as his own; and "the name of My God" signifies the Divine truth. Here something shall be said of this, that "My God" is the Divine truth. In the Word of the Old Testament, in innumerable places, "Jehovah God" occurs, as also separately, sometimes "Jehovah," and sometimes "God," and by "Jehovah" is meant the Lord as to the Divine good, and by "God" is meant the Lord as to the Divine truth; or what is the same, by "Jehovah" is meant the Lord as to the Divine love, and by "God" is meant the Lord as to the Divine wisdom; both terms are used for the sake of the heavenly marriage in all the particulars of the Word, which is the marriage of love and wisdom, or the marriage of good and truth, concerning which marriage see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning Sacred Scripture, (<a href="80.htm">80-90</a>).</p><p>[2] But in the Word of the New Testament it is not said Jehovah God, but "Lord God;" for "Lord," like "Jehovah" signifies the Divine good or the Divine love. From these things it may appear, that by "the name of My God" is signified the Divine truth of the Lord. That "name," when spoken of the Lord, is the all by which He is worshiped, may be seen above, (<a href="81.htm">81</a>[1-4]) and the all by which He is worshiped, has relation to the Divine good and the Divine truth. As it is not known what is meant by the following words of the Lord, it shall be told:<p>Father, glorify Thy name; then came forth a voice from heaven, I have glorified it, and will glorify it again, (<a href="3927/john_12_28.htm">John 12:28</a>).<p>The Lord, when He was in the world, made His Human the Divine truth, which also is the Word, and when He went out of the world, He fully united the Divine truth to the Divine good, which was in Him from conception; for the Lord glorified His Human, that is, made it Divine, as He makes man spiritual; for He first introduces into man truths from the Word, and afterwards unites them to good, and by that union man is made spiritual. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 193 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>193. "Et scribam super illum Nomen Dei Mei," significat quod cordibus illorum inscriptum erit Divinum Verum. - "Scribere" super aliquem, significat inscribere ut sit in illo tanquam ejus; et "Nomen Dei Mei" significat Divinum Verum. Hic aliquid de eo, quod "Deus Meus" sit Divinum Verum, dicetur: in Verbo Veteris Testamenti innumeris in locis dicitur "Jehovah Deus," tum separatim, nunc "Jehovah" nunc "Deus;" et per "Jehovam" intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum, et per "Deum" Dominus quoad <sup>1</sup>Divinum Verum; seu quod idem, per "Jehovam" intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Amorem, et per "Deum" Dominus quoad Divinam Sapientiam; utrumque dicitur propter conjugium caeleste in singulis Verbi, quod est conjugium Amoris et Sapientiae, seu conjugium boni et veri, de quo conjugio videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_193/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_80" target=_top>Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 80-90</a>. In Verbo autem Novi Testamenti non dicitur Jehovah Deus, sed "Dominus Deus," nam "Dominus" sicut "Jehovah" significat Divinum Bonum seu Divinum Amorem: ex his constare potest, quod per "Nomen Dei Mei," significetur Divinum Verum Domini. Quod "Nomen," cum de Domino, sit omne per quod colitur, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_193/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_81" target=_top>81</a>); et omne per quod colitur, se refert ad Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum. Quia non scitur quid intelligitur per haec Domini verba, <p>"Pater glorifica Tuum Nomen; et exivit vox e Caelo, et glorificavi, et rursus glorificabo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_193/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_28" target=_top>Johannes 12:28</a>), <p>ideo dicetur: Dominus cum in mundo fuit, fecit Humanum Suum Divinum Verum, quod etiam est Verbum; et cum exivit e mundo, plene univit Divinum Verum Divino Bono, quod fuit in Ipso ex conceptione: Dominus enim glorificavit, hoc est, Divinum fecit Humanum Suum, sicut hominem facit spiritualem; indit enim homini primum vera ex Verbo, et postea unit illa bono, et per unitionem illam fit homo spiritualis.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;quoad pro "quod" </p>
