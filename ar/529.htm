<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第529节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>529.启11:19.“于是神天上的殿开了，在祂殿中现出祂的约柜”表新天堂，主在新天堂以其神性人受到敬拜；并且那里的人照主的十诫生活，这两条是新教会的两大基本要素，由此实现结合。“神的殿”表示主的神性人，同样表示天使所在的天堂，还表示地上的教会；这三者由“神的殿”来表示，并且它们不可分割开（参看<a href="191.htm">191</a>节）；不过，此处“神的殿”表示主以其神性人而在天使所在的天堂，因为经上说的是“神天上的殿”。“殿中的约柜”表示十诫，因为约柜里面只有两块刻有十诫的石版。“殿开了”表示这二者，即神性人与十诫，也就是新教会的两大基本要素，如今被看到了，并且在恶人投入地狱后就已经被看到了（<a href="528.htm">528</a>节）。这柜之所以被称为“祂殿中的约柜”，是因为“约”表示结合，下面会看到这一点。</p><p>不过，有必要先说一下十诫。全世界有哪个民族不知道杀人、奸淫、偷盗、作假证是恶呢？若不知道这些事，若不立法防范这些罪恶，人类必灭亡；因为没有这些法律，社会、共同国或王国就会崩溃。谁会以为以色列民族就比其它民族愚蠢得多，以至于连这些事是恶都不知道？所以，有人或许觉得奇怪，耶和华为何以如此大的神迹亲自在西乃山上颁布这些全世界众所周知的法律，还用自己的手指头来刻写？但请听：耶和华以如此大的神迹亲自颁布，并用手指头来刻写这些法律是要叫人们知道，这些法律不仅是文明、道德的法律，还是属灵的法律；违反它们，不仅是向同胞和社会行恶，还得罪神。因此，耶和华从西乃山上所颁布的这些法律就成为宗教律法。由此明显可知，凡耶和华神所吩咐的，祂也会令其成为宗教的事，要为祂的缘故行出来，也是为了人的缘故，好叫人可以得救。</p><p>由于这些法律是主即将在以色列民族当中所建立教会的最初果实，简明扼要地概括了宗教信仰的一切事物，主与人，并人与主的结合由此被赐下，所以它们如此神圣，以致再没有比这更神圣的了。它们是至圣的，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：耶和华自己，也就是主，在火中降临，然后山冒烟、震动，并有雷轰、闪电、密云和角声（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.16.htm">19:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.18.htm">18</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.22.htm">5:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.26.htm">26</a>）；耶和华降临前，百姓做好预备，使自己成圣三天（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.10.htm">19:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.15.htm">15</a>）；山的四围定界限，免得有人靠近山脚，恐怕他死亡（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.12.htm">19:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.20.htm">20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.23.htm">23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.1.htm">24:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.2.htm">2</a>）；这些律法被写在两块石版上，是神用手指头写的（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.18.htm">31:18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.15.htm">32:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.16.htm">16</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申9.10.htm">9:10</a>）；当摩西第二次带石版下山时，面皮发光（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.29.htm">34:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.35.htm">35</a>）；这两块石版被放在柜子里（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.16.htm">25:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.20.htm">40:20</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申10.5.htm">10:5</a>；列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上8.9.htm">8:9</a>）；约柜在会幕中所在之地被称为“至圣所”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.33.htm">26:33</a>，以及其它地方）；约柜因其中律法而被称为耶和华在那里（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.35.htm">10:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.36.htm">36</a>；撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上6.2.htm">6:2</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗132.8.htm">132:8</a>）；耶和华在约柜之上与摩西说话（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.22.htm">25:22</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.89.htm">7:89</a>）；由于这些律法的神圣，亚伦不可进到幔子里面，也就是约柜所在的地方，除非是献祭和烧香，免得他死亡（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.2.htm">16:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.14.htm">14</a>等）；因着主在约柜中这些律法里面的临在和能力，约旦河水被截断，只要约柜停在河中间，百姓就从干地上过去（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.1.htm">3:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书4.5.htm">4:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书4.20.htm">20</a>）；抬着约柜绕耶利哥城，城墙就倒塌（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书6.1.htm">6:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书6.20.htm">20</a>）；非利士的神大衮在约柜前仆倒在地，后来头在殿的门槛上被折断（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上5.3.htm">5:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上5.4.htm">4</a>）；以革仑和伯示麦因约柜有数千人被击杀（撒母耳记上5-6章）；大卫献祭、欢欢喜喜地将约柜运进锡安（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下6.1.htm">6:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下6.19.htm">19</a>）；乌撒因扶约柜而死（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下6.6.htm">6:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下6.7.htm">7</a>）；耶路撒冷圣殿里的约柜是至内在部分（列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.19.htm">6:19</a>等；<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上8.3.htm">8:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上8.9.htm">9</a>）；律法刻写其上的两块石版被称为“约版”，柜子因这两块石版而被称为“约柜”，这些律法本身被称为“约”（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.33.htm">10:33</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.13.htm">4:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.23.htm">23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.2.htm">5:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.3.htm">3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申9.9.htm">9:9</a>；约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.11.htm">3:11</a>；列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上8.19.htm">8:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上8.21.htm">21</a>；以及其它地方）。</p><p>这被称为“约”的律法表示结合；原因在于，“约”是为了爱、友谊、联合，因而结合而订立的。故经上论到主说：</p><p>祂要作众民的约。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.6.htm">42:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.8.htm">49:8</a>）</p><p>并且祂被称为：</p><p>立约的使者。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.1.htm">3:1</a>）</p><p>祂的血被称为：</p><p>立约的血。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.28.htm">26:28</a> ；撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.11.htm">9:11</a>；出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.4.htm">24:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>所以，圣言被称为“旧约”和“新约”。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 529</h4><p>529. Then the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple. (<a href="3927/revelation_11_19.htm">11:19</a>) This symbolizes the New Heaven, in which the Lord is worshiped in His Divine humanity, and where people live in accordance with the Ten Commandments, which constitute the two essential elements of the New Church that are the means of conjunction.<p>The temple of God symbolizes the Lord's Divine humanity, also heaven where angels dwell, and likewise the church on earth. To be shown that the temple of God has these three symbolic meanings, and that the three cannot be separated, see no. <a href="191.htm">191</a>. Here, however, the temple of God symbolizes the Lord in His Divine humanity in heaven where angels dwell, because it is said to be the temple of God in heaven. The ark in the temple means the Ten Commandments, for the ark had as its sole contents the two tables on which the Ten Commandments were written. <sup>1</sup>The temple's being opened means, symbolically, that these two, the Divine humanity and the Ten Commandments, which are the two essential elements of the New Church, are now visible, and that they became visible after the evil were cast into hell (no. <a href="528.htm">528</a>). The ark is called the ark of His covenant in His temple because a covenant symbolizes conjunction, as we will see below. But first we must say something about the Ten Commandments.</p><p>[2] What nation in the entire world does not know that it is evil to kill, commit adultery, steal, and bear false witness? If nations did not know this and enact laws to keep people from doing these things, it would be all over with them. For society, the republic, or kingdom would collapse without these laws.<p>Who can suppose that the Israelite nation was so stupid in comparison to all other nations as not to know that such actions are evil? One may wonder, therefore, why these laws, being so universally known throughout the whole world, were promulgated by Jehovah Himself from Mount Sinai, attended by the great miracle they were, and written, moreover, with His finger.<p>But listen, they were promulgated by Jehovah with such a great miracle and written with His finger in order that people might know that these laws are not only civil and moral laws, but also spiritual laws, and that to disobey them is not only to do evil to one's fellow citizen and to society, but is also to sin against God. Their promulgation by Jehovah from Mount Sinai made them therefore laws of religion. For it is evident that whatever Jehovah God commands, He commands to make it a matter of religion, so that it must be obeyed for His sake, and for a person's own sake, that he may be saved.</p><p>[3] Because these laws were the first elements of the church to be established by the Lord with the Israelite nation, and because they embrace in brief summary everything having to do with religion which makes possible a conjunction of the Lord with a person and of a person with the Lord, therefore they were so holy that nothing was more holy.<p>That they were so very holy can be seen from the following: That Jehovah Himself, that is to say, the Lord, descended in fire; that the mountain then smoked and quaked; and that this was attended by thunderings, lightnings, a thick cloud, and the sound of a trumpet (<a href="3927/exodus_19_16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_19_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22-26</a>). That before Jehovah descended, the people readied themselves and sanctified themselves for three days (<a href="3927/exodus_19_10.htm">Exodus 19:10-11</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_19_15.htm">15</a>). That in the Temple at Jerusalem the Ark constituted the inner sanctuary (<a href="3927/1-kings_6_19.htm">1 Kings 6:19</a>ff., <a href="3927/1-kings_8_3.htm">8:3-9</a>). That the tablets on which the Law was written were called the tablets of the covenant, and because of them the Ark was called the ark of the covenant, with the Law itself being called the covenant (<a href="3927/numbers_10_33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_4_13.htm">Deuteronomy 4:13</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_4_23.htm">23</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_2.htm">5:2-3</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_9_9.htm">9:9</a>, <a href="3927/joshua_3_11.htm">Joshua 3:11</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_8_19.htm">1 Kings 8:19</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_8_21.htm">21</a>, and elsewhere).<p>The Law's being called a covenant symbolizes conjunction. The reason is that covenants are made for the sake of love, friendship, and association, thus for the sake of conjunction. That is why we find it said of the Lord that He will be "a covenant to the people" (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_49_8.htm">49:8</a>), and He is called "the Messenger of the covenant" (<a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>). His blood also is called "the blood of the covenant" (<a href="3927/matthew_26_28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>, cf. <a href="3927/zechariah_9_11.htm">Zechariah 9:11</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_24_4.htm">Exodus 24:4-10</a>). And therefore the Word is called the Old and New Testaments or Covenants.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="3927/1-kings_8_9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 529</h4><p>529. [verse 19] 'And the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of [His] covenant was seen in His temple' signifies the New Heaven, in which the Lord is worshipped in His Divine Human and there is living in accordance with the precepts of His Decalogue, these being the two Essentials of the New Church whereby conjunction [is effected] . By 'the temple of God' is signified the Lord's Divine Human, likewise heaven where the angels are, as also the Church on earth. That these three are signified by 'the temple of God,' and that they cannot be separated, may be seen (<a href="191.htm">191</a>). Here, however, by 'the temple of God' is signified the Lord in His Divine Human in heaven where angels are, because it is said, 'the temple of God in heaven.' By 'the ark in the temple' is understood the Decalogue, for in the ark there were only the two tables on which the Decalogue had been written. By 'opened' is signified that those two, the Divine Human and the Decalogue, which are the two Essentials of the New Church, were now seen, and they were seen after the evil were cast into hell (<a href="528.htm">528</a>). 'The ark of His covenant in His temple' is said, because a 'covenant' signifies conjunction, concerning which [something shall be said] below.</p><p>[2] But first something shall be said concerning the Decalogue. What nation throughout the entire world does not know that it is evil to kill, commit adultery, steal, and bear false witness? If these things were not known, and if care were not taken that such things be enacted by means of laws, it would be all up with the nations, for a society, a republic, or a kingdom would fall without these laws. Who can suppose that the Israelitish nation was so much more stupid than all other nations, that it did not know that those things were evil? Therefore anyone may wonder why those laws, recognised universally throughout the world, were promulgated by Jehovah Himself from Mount Sinai with so great a miracle, so that they were also written with His finger. But hear! They were promulgated so miraculously by Jehovah and written with His finger so that it might be known that those laws were not only civil and moral laws but also spiritual laws, and that to act against them was not only to do evil against the fellow citizen and society but also to sin against God. These laws, therefore, by their promulgation from Mount Sinai by Jehovah were made laws of religion; for it is clear that whatever Jehovah God commands He commands so that it may be a matter of religion, and that it is to be done for His sake and for the man's sake that he may be saved.</p><p>[3] These laws, because they were the first-fruits of the Church about to be set up by the Lord with the Israelitish nation, and because they were in a short summary the complex of all the things of religion by which a conjunction of the Lord with man and of man with the Lord is given, were therefore so holy that nothing was holier. That they were most holy can be established from this, that:<p>Jehovah Himself; that is, the Lord descended in fire, and the mountain then smoked and quaked, and there were thunders, lightnings, a thick cloud and the voice of a trumpet, <a href="3927/exodus_19_16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_19_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22-26</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_19.htm">19-23</a>].<p>The people, before the descent of Jehovah, prepared and sanctified themselves for three days, <a href="3927/exodus_19_10.htm">Exodus 19:10-11</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_19_15.htm">15</a>.<p>The mountain was fenced around lest anyone come near to its lowest part, lest he die, <a href="3927/exodus_19_12.htm">Exodus 19:12-13</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_19_20.htm">20-23</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_24_1.htm">24:1-2</a>.<p>The law was written on two tables of stone, and written with the finger of God, <a href="3927/exodus_31_18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_32_15.htm">32:15-16</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_9_10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10</a>.<p>When Moses brought those tables down from the mount the second time, he had a shining face, <a href="3927/exodus_34_29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>.<p>The tables were put in the ark, <a href="3927/exodus_25_16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_40_20.htm">40:20</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_10_5.htm">Deuteronomy 10:5</a>; <a href="3927/1-kings_8_9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a>.<p>The place in the tabernacle where the ark was, was termed the holy of holies, <a href="3927/exodus_26_33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a>, and elsewhere.<p>The ark by virtue of the law therein, was termed Jehovah there. <a href="3927/numbers_10_35.htm">Numbers 10:35-36</a>; <a href="3927/2-samuel_6_2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_132_8.htm">Psalms 132:8</a>.<p>Jehovah spoke with Moses above the ark, <a href="3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_7_89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>.<p>On account of the holiness of the law it was not permitted for Aaron to enter within the veil, where the ark was, except with sacrifices and incense, lest he die. <a href="3927/leviticus_16_2.htm">Leviticus 16:2-14</a> seq.<p>As a result of the presence and power of the Lord in the law that was in the ark, the waters of the Jordan were cut apart, and so long as it was resting in the midst, the people went over on dry ground, <a href="3927/joshua_3_1.htm">Joshua 3:1-17</a>; <a href="3927/joshua_4_5.htm">4:5-20</a>.<p>By means of the ark's being carried around them, the walls of Jericho fell down, <a href="3927/joshua_6_1.htm">Joshua 6:1-20</a>.<p>Dagon, god of the Philistines, fell down to the earth before the ark, and afterwards lay upon the threshold of the temple decapitated, <a href="3927/1-samuel_5_3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3-4</a>.<p>The Ekronites and the Bethshemites were smitten on account of the ark to [the number of] several thousands, <a href="3927/1-samuel_5_1.htm">1 Samuel 5</a> and <a href="3927/1-samuel_6_1.htm">6</a>.<p>The ark was led into Zion by David with sacrifices and rejoicing, <a href="3927/2-samuel_6_1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1-19</a>.<p>Uzzah died then, because he touched it, <a href="3927/2-samuel_6_6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>.<p>The ark in the Jerusalem temple made the inmost part (Adytum), <a href="3927/1-kings_6_19.htm">1 Kings 6:19</a> seq.; <a href="3927/1-kings_8_3.htm">8:3-9</a>.<p>The tables on which the law was written were termed the tables of the covenant, and the ark by virtue of them was termed the ark of the covenant, and the law itself the covenant. <a href="3927/numbers_10_33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_4_13.htm">Deuteronomy 4:13</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_4_23.htm">23</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_2.htm">5:2-3</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_9_9.htm">9:9</a>; <a href="3927/joshua_3_11.htm">Joshua 3:11</a>; <a href="3927/1-kings_8_19.htm">1 Kings 8:19</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_8_21.htm">21</a>; and elsewhere.</p><p>[4] That the law was termed the 'covenant' signifies conjunction.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 529</h4><p>529. Verse 19. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple the ark of His covenant, signifies the New Heaven, in which the Lord in His Divine Human is worshiped, and they live according to the commandments of His Decalogue, which are the two essentials of the New Church, by which is conjunction. By "the temple of God" is signified the Lord's Divine Human, likewise heaven, where angels are, and also the church on earth; that these three are signified by "the temple of God," and that they cannot be separated, may be seen, (<a href="191.htm">191</a>); but here, by "the temple of God," is signified the Lord in His Divine Human in heaven where the angels are, because it is called "the temple of God in heaven." By "the ark in the temple" is meant the Decalogue, for in the ark there were only the two tables on which the Decalogue was written. By the temple being "open" is signified that these two, the Divine Human and the Decalogue, which are the two essentials of the New Church, are now seen, and were seen after the evil were cast into hell, (<a href="528.htm">528</a>). The reason why it is said "the ark of His covenant was in His temple," is, because a covenant signifies conjunction, as will be seen below.</p><p>[2] But something shall first be said of the Decalogue. What nation is there in the whole world which does not know that it is evil to kill, to commit adultery, to steal, to testify falsely? If mankind did not know these things, and if laws were not made to guard against these crimes, they must perish; for a society, republic, and kingdom, would fall without such laws. Who can suppose that the Israelitish nation could have been so much more stupid than all others, as not to know that these things were evils? Therefore anyone may wonder why these laws, universally known throughout the whole world, should have been promulgated by Jehovah Himself from Mount Sinai with so great a miracle, and were written with His own finger. But hear: they were promulgated with so great a miracle by Jehovah Himself, and were written by His finger, to make known to them that those laws were not only civil and moral laws, but also spiritual laws, and that to act contrary to them, was not only to commit evil against a fellow citizen and against society, but that it was also to sin against God.<p>Wherefore these laws, by being promulgated from Mount Sinai by Jehovah, were made laws of religion. For it is evident that whatsoever Jehovah God commands, He commands that it may be a thing of religion, and that it should be done for His sake, and for man's sake, that he may be saved.</p><p>[3] These laws, because they were the first fruits of the church about to be established by the Lord among the Israelitish nation, and because they were in a short summary the complex of all things of religion, whereby a conjunction of the Lord with man and of man with the Lord was given, therefore they were so holy, that nothing could be more holy. That they were most holy may appear from this that:<p>Jehovah Himself, that is the Lord, descended in fire, and the mountain then smoked and quaked, and there were thunders, and lightnings, and a thick cloud, and the voice of a trumpet, (<a href="3927/exodus_19_16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_19_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22-26</a>).<p>The people before the descent of Jehovah prepared and sanctified themselves three days, (<a href="3927/exodus_19_10.htm">Exodus 19:10-11</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_19_15.htm">15</a>).<p>The mountain was hedged about lest anyone come near to the lowest part, lest he die, (<a href="3927/exodus_19_12.htm">Exodus 19:12-13</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_19_20.htm">20-23</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_24_1.htm">24:1-2</a>).<p>This law was written upon two tables of stone, and that it was written with the finger of God, (<a href="3927/exodus_31_18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_32_15.htm">32:15-16</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_9_10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10</a>).<p>The face of Moses shone, when he brought those tables a second time down from the mount, (<a href="3927/exodus_34_29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>).<p>Those tables were deposited in the ark, (<a href="3927/exodus_25_16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_40_20.htm">40:20</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_10_5.htm">Deuteronomy 10:5</a>; <a href="3927/1-kings_8_9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a>).<p>The place in the tabernacle, where the ark was, was called the Holy of Holies, (<a href="3927/exodus_26_33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a>; and in other places).<p>The ark, from the law in it, was called Jehovah there, (<a href="3927/numbers_10_35.htm">Numbers 10:35-36</a>; <a href="3927/2-samuel_6_2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_132_8.htm">Psalms 132:8</a>).<p>Jehovah spoke with Moses over the ark, (<a href="3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_7_89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>).<p>On account of the holiness of that law, it was not permitted Aaron to enter within the veil, where the ark was, except with sacrifices and incense, lest he die, (<a href="3927/leviticus_16_2.htm">Leviticus 16:2-14</a> seq.).<p>From the Lord's presence and power in the law which was in the ark, the waters of Jordan were divided, and so long as it rested in the midst, the people passed over on dry ground, (<a href="3927/joshua_3_1.htm">Joshua 3:1-17</a>; <a href="3927/joshua_4_5.htm">4:5-20</a>).<p>By carrying the ark around Jericho, the walls fell down, (<a href="3927/joshua_6_1.htm">Joshua 6:1-20</a>).<p>Dagon, the god of the Philistines, fell down to the earth before the ark, and afterwards lay upon the threshold of the temple with his head broken off, (<a href="3927/1-samuel_5_3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3-4</a>).<p>The Ekronites and the Bethshemites were smitten on account of the ark to the number of several thousands, (<a href="3927/1-samuel_5_1.htm">1 Samuel 5</a>; <a href="3927/1-samuel_6_1.htm">6</a>).<p>The ark was introduced by David into Zion with sacrifices and rejoicing, (<a href="3927/2-samuel_6_1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1-19</a>).<p>Uzzah, because he then touched it, died, (<a href="3927/2-samuel_6_6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>).<p>The ark in the temple of Jerusalem was the inmost part, (<a href="3927/1-kings_6_19.htm">1 Kings 6:19</a> seq. ; <a href="3927/1-kings_8_3.htm">8:3-9</a>).<p>The tables upon which the law was written, were called the tables of the covenant, and the ark, from them, was called the ark of the covenant, and the law itself the covenant, (<a href="3927/numbers_10_33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_4_13.htm">Deuteronomy 4:13</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_4_23.htm">23</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_5_2.htm">5:2-3</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_9_9.htm">9:9</a>; <a href="3927/joshua_3_11.htm">Joshua 3:11</a>; <a href="3927/1-kings_8_19.htm">1 Kings 8:19</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_8_21.htm">21</a>; and other places).</p><p>[4] By that law called "a covenant," conjunction is signified; the reason is, because covenants were entered into for the sake of love, of friendship, of consociation, and thus of conjunction. Therefore it is said of the Lord, that:<p>He shall be for a covenant to the people, (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_49_8.htm">49:8</a>).<p>And He is called:<p>The angel of the covenant, (<a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>).<p>And His blood:<p>The blood of the covenant, (<a href="3927/matthew_26_28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_9_11.htm">Zechariah 9:11</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_24_4.htm">Exodus 24:4-10</a>).<p>And therefore the Word is called the Old and the New Testament or Covenant. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 529 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>529. (Vers. 19.) "Et apertum est Templum Dei in Caelo, et visa est Arca foederis (Ipsius) in Templo Ipsius," significat Novum Caelum, in quo Dominus in Divino Humano Suo colitur, et secundum praecepta Decalogi Ipsius vivitur, quae sunt duo Essentialia Novae Ecclesiae, per quae conjunctio. - Per "Templum Dei" significatur Divinum Humanum Domini, tum Caelum ubi Angeli, ut et Ecclesia in terris quod haec tria significentur per "Templum Dei," et quod non separari possint, videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_529/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_191" target=_top>191</a>; hic autem per "Templum Dei" significatur Dominus in Divino Humano Suo in Caelo ubi Angeli, quia dicitur "Templum Dei in Caelo;" per "Arcam in Templo" intelligitur Decalogus, nam in Arca fuerunt solum duae tabulae quibus inscriptus erat Decalogus per "apertum" significatur quod illa duo, Divinum Humanum et Decalogus, quae sunt duo Essentialia Novae Ecclesiae, nunc visa sint, ac visa sunt postquam mali in Infernum conjecti sunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_529/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_528" target=_top>528</a>); quod dicatur "Arca foederis Ipsius, in Templo Ipsius," est quia foedus significat conjunctionem, de quo infra. Sed primum aliquid dicetur de Decalogo. <p>Quaenam gens in universo terrarum orbe non novit quod malum sit occidere, adulterari, furari, false <sup>1</sup>testari nisi haec scirent, et ne talia faciant per leges caverent, actum foret de illis; nam societas, respublica et regnum absque illis legibus caderent. Quis autumare potest, quod gens Israelitica prae omnibus aliis gentibus tam stupida fuerit, ut ignoraverit quod illa essent mala. Quapropter mirari quis potest cur Leges illae, universaliter in terrarum orbe cognitae, cum tanto miraculo e monte Sinai ab Ipso Jehovah promulgatae, ut et digito Ipsius scriptae fuerint. Sed audi: cum tali miraculo a Jehovah promulgatae et digito Ipsius scriptae fuerunt, ut scirent quod Leges illae non modo Leges civiles et morales essent, sed etiam Leges spirituales, et quod facere contra illas non modo esset malum facere contra concivem et contra societatem, sed etiam esset peccare contra Deum quare Leges illae, per promulgationem e monte Sinai a Jehovah, factae sunt Leges Religionis. Evidens enim est, quod quicquid Jehovah Deus mandat, hoc mandet ut Religionis sit, et quod faciendum sit propter Ipsum, et propter hominem ut salvetur. Illae Leges, quia fuerunt primitiae Ecclesiae a Domino apud Gentem Israeliticam instaurandae, et quia erant in brevi summario complexus omnium Religionis, per quae conjunctio Domini cum homine et hominis cum Domino datur, ideo tam sanctae fuerunt, ut nihil sanctius. Quod sanctissimae fuerint, constare potest ex eo: <p>Quod Ipse Jehovah, hoc est Dominus, descenderit in igne, et quod tunc fumaverit et contremuerit Mons, et quod "fuerint tonitrua, fulgura, nubes gravis et vox buccinae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_529/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_19_16" target=_top>Exodus 19:16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_529/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_19_18" target=_top>18</a>;
