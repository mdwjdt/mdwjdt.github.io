<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第691节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>691.“叫日头能用火以热烤人”表对主的爱折磨他们，因为他们出于其爱之快乐而陷入邪恶的欲望。由于“倒他的香瓶”表示从主来自良善与真理的流注，所以“把他的香瓶倒在日头上”表示从主来自神性之爱的流注，以便揭露这教会之人当中的爱之性质。因此，“叫日头能用火以热烤人”表示主的神性之爱折磨他们；由于主的神性之爱除了那些出于自我之爱的快乐而陷入邪恶的欲望之人外，并不折磨任何人，故可知“叫日头能用火以热烤人”表示对主的爱折磨他们，因为他们出于自我之爱的快乐而陷入邪恶的欲望。“热”表示对邪恶、因而对虚假的欲望（参看<a href="382.htm">382</a>节）；“火”表示神性之爱，在反面意义上表示地狱之爱（<a href="494.htm">494</a>节）。自我之爱就是地狱之爱，其快乐就是地狱的快乐，这爱的快乐通过无数恶欲存在，并由这些恶欲构成；这一点在《圣治》和《圣爱与圣智》中多有说明。这一事实在基督教界不为人知，因为他们不知道何为对主之爱，对主之爱会教导自我之爱的性质。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 691</h4><p>691. And it was given to him to scorch people with fire. This symbolically means that love toward the Lord tormented them, because they were caught up in lusts for evils emanating from the delight of their love.<p>Since to pour out the bowl symbolizes an influx from the Lord springing from goods and truths, therefore to pour out the bowl onto the sun symbolizes an influx from the Lord emanating from Divine love to expose the character of the love present in people belonging to that church. Consequently, the angel's being given to scorch people with fire means symbolically that the Lord's Divine love tormented them. And because the Lord's Divine love torments only people who are caught up in lusts for evils springing from the delight of self-love, it follows then that the angel's being given to scorch people with fire means symbolically that love toward the Lord tormented them because they were caught up in lusts for evils springing from the delight of self-love.<p>That heat symbolizes lusts for evils and so for falsities may be seen in no. <a href="382.htm">382</a> above; and that fire symbolizes Divine love, and in an opposite sense, hellish love, may be seen in no. <a href="494.htm">494</a> above.<p>Self-love is a hellish love, and its accompanying delight a hellish delight, and the delight accompanying that love springs from and consists of countless lusts for evils. This we have shown many times in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Providence, and in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom. The reality of this is not known in the Christian world, because people do not know what love toward the Lord is, and it is this love that teaches what self-love is. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 691</h4><p>691. 'And it was given him to strike men down with heat by means of fire' signifies that love directed to the Lord was torturing them because they were in the lusts of the evils derived from the delight of their love. Since by 'to pour out the phial' is signified an influx from the Lord out of goods and truths, therefore by 'to pour out the phial into the sun' is signified an influx from the Lord out of Divine Love for the purpose of discovering what the love with the men of that Church was like. Consequently by 'it was given to the angel to strike men down with heat by means of fire' is signified that the Lord's Divine Love tortured them. And because the Lord's Divine Love only tortures those who are in the lusts of evil derived from the delight of the love of self, therefore it follows that by 'it was given him to strike down men with heat by means of fire' is signified that love directed to the Lord tortured them because they were in the lusts of evils derived from the delight of the love of self. That 'heat' signifies lusts for evils, and consequently for untruths, may be seen above (<a href="382.htm">382</a>), and that 'fire' signifies Divine Love, and in the opposite sense infernal love (<a href="494.htm">494</a> above). That the love of self is an infernal love, and its delight an infernal delight, and that the delight of that love has its existence and consistency as the result of innumerable lusts of evils, has been shown many times in ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE PROVIDENCE , also in ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM. That this is the case is unknown in Christendom, because it is not known what love directed to the Lord is, and this love will teach what the love of self is. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 691</h4><p>691. And it was given unto him to scorch men with fire, signifies that love to the Lord tormented them, because they were in the lusts of evils from the delight of the loves of them. Since by "pouring out his vial" is signified influx from the Lord from goods and truths, therefore by "pouring his vial upon the sun" is signified influx from the Lord from the Divine love, in order to disclose the quality of the love with the men of that church. Hence, by "it was given to the angel to scorch men with fire," is signified that the Divine love of the Lord tormented them, and because the Divine love of the Lord does not torment any but those who are in the lusts of evils from the delight of self-love, it thence follows, that by "it was given unto him to scorch men with fire," is signified that love to the Lord tormented them, because they were in the lusts of evils from the delight of self-love. That "heat" signifies lusts for evils and thence for falsities may be seen above, (<a href="382.htm">382</a>); and that "fire" signifies the Divine love, and, in the opposite sense, infernal love, (<a href="494.htm">494</a>). That self-love is infernal love, and that its delight is infernal delight, and that the delight of that love exists from and consists of innumerable lusts of evils, is shown in many places in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Providence, and also in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom. That this is the case is not known in the Christian world, because it is not known what love to the Lord is, and this love will teach the nature of self-love. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 691 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>691. "Et datum est illi aestu affligere homines per ignem," significat quod amor in Dominum illos torqueret, quia in concupiscentiis malorum ex jucundo amoris illorum erant. - Quoniam per "effundere phialam" significatur influxus a Domino ex bonis et veris, inde per "effundere phialam in Solem" significatur influxus a Domino ex Divino Amore, ad detegendum qualis amor esset apud homines istius Ecclesiae; inde per "datum Angelo aestu affligere homines per ignem," significatur quod Amor Divinus Domini torqueret illos; et quia Divinus Amor Domini non alios torquet quam illos qui in concupiscentiis malorum ex jucundo amoris sui sunt, inde sequitur, quod per "datum est illi aestu affligere homines per ignem," significetur quod amor in Dominum illos torqueret, quia in concupiscentiis malorum ex jucundo amoris sui erant: quod "aestus" significet concupiscentias ad mala et inde ad falsa, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_691/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_382" target=_top>382</a>); et quod "ignis" significet Divinum Amorem, et in opposito sensu amorem infernalem, supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_691/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_494" target=_top>494</a>). Quod amor sui sit amor infernalis, et quod jucundum ejus sit jucundum infernale, et quod jucundum illius amoris existat et consistat ex innumeris concupiscentiis malorum, multis ostensum est in Sapientia Angelica de Divina Providentia, tum in Sapientia Angelica de Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia: quod ita sit, nescitur in Orbe Christiano, quia nescitur quid amor in Dominum, et hic amor docebit quid amor sui. </p>
