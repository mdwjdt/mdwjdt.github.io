<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>782.启18:14.“你灵魂所贪爱的果子离开了你，一切的珍馐肥甘，和华美的物件，也离开你，你决不能再见了”表天上的一切祝福和幸福，甚至诸如他们所渴求的外在的那种将完全逃离，不再出现，因为他们没有对良善与真理的任何属天或属灵的情感。“灵魂所贪爱的果子”无非表示天上的祝福和幸福，因为它们就是所论述的教义和敬拜的一切事物的果子，还因为它们是人临终时的渴望，也是人初入灵界时的渴望。“珍馐肥甘和华美的物件”表示对良善与真理的属天或属灵的情感；“珍馐肥甘”表示对良善的情感，如下文所述；“华美的物件”表示对真理的情感。这些之所以被称为“华美”，是因为它们的存在是因着天堂之光，及其在心智中的光辉；良善与真理的聪明，以及智慧由此而来。“离开”和“决不能再见”表示它们将要逃离，不再出现，因为他们并未处于任何属天或属灵的良善与真理。之所以说“甚至诸如他们所渴求的外在的那种”，是因为他们所渴求的，无非是肉体和世俗的祝福、幸福和情感，因而他们无从知晓何为所谓的属天和属灵的祝福和幸福，或它们的性质。</p><p>这些事可通过对他们死后命运的揭示来说明。天主教中所有那些陷入源于自我之爱的统治之爱，因而陷入尘世之爱的人，当进入灵界（死后即发生）时，所渴求的，无非是统治和由此带给心智的愉悦，以及由财富所产生的身体的愉悦；因为主导爱及其情感，或死后，欲望和渴望仍存留在每个人里面。但源于自我之爱而对统治教会和天堂的神圣事物（所有这些事物都是主的神性事物）的爱是可憎的，故经过一段时日后，他们就与自己的同伴分开，被投入地狱。尽管如此，他们因曾处于源自其宗教的外在敬拜，故首先被教导何为天堂及其性质，以及何为永生的幸福及其性质。他们还被教导，来自主的纯粹祝福照着天上的人对良善与真理的属天情感的性质而流入他们每一个里面。但他们没有靠近主，因而没有与祂结合，也没有处于对良善与真理的任何情感，所以就憎恶它们，转身离去，然后渴望自我之爱和尘世之爱的乐趣，而这些乐趣纯粹是属世和肉体的。由于作恶，尤其向那些敬拜主的人、因而向天上的天使作恶是这些乐趣所固有的，所以他们也被剥夺了这些乐趣，然后在他们那些地狱劳工房中处于蔑视和痛苦的同伴当中遭到弃绝。不过，这些事照着对统治主的神性事物之爱的程度临到他们身上，他们也照着这个程度弃绝主。</p><p>由此明显可知，“你灵魂所贪爱的果子离开了你，一切的珍馐肥甘，和华美的物件，也离开你，你决不能再见了”表示天上的一切祝福和幸福，甚至诸如他们所渴求的外在的那种将完全逃离，不再出现，因为他们没有对良善与真理的任何情感。“肥甘”（fat things，或译肥油，脂油，汁浆等）表示属天的良善及其情感，以及这些情感的快乐；这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>你们要留意听我的话，就能吃那美物，你的灵魂得享肥甘。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.2.htm">55:2</a>）</p><p>我必以肥油使祭司的灵魂满足，我的百姓也要因恩惠知足。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.14.htm">31:14</a>）</p><p>我的灵魂就饱足了骨髓肥油，我的口也要以欢乐的嘴唇赞美你。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗63.5.htm">63:5</a>）</p><p>他们必因你殿里的肥甘得以饱足，你也必叫他们喝你乐河的水。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗36.8.htm">36:8</a>）</p><p>在这山上，耶和华必为万民用肥甘设摆筵席，用满髓的肥甘。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛25.6.htm">25:6</a> ）</p><p>他们年老的时候仍要结果子，要满了汁浆而常发青，好显明耶和华是正直的。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗 92.14.htm"> 92:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗 92.15.htm">15</a>）</p><p>在耶和华所设的祭筵中，他们必吃脂油直到饱足，喝血直到醉了。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结 39.19.htm"> 39:19</a>）</p><p>耶和华要使脂油作你的燔祭。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗 20.3.htm"> 20:3</a>）</p><p>“肥甘”（fat things，或译肥油，脂油，汁浆等）表示属天的良善，所以有这样一条律例：</p><p>献祭动物的脂油要烧在坛上。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.13.htm">29:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.22.htm">22</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利1.8.htm">1:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利3.3.htm">3:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利3.16.htm">16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.8.htm">4:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.35.htm">35</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.3.htm">7:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.30.htm">30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.31.htm">31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利17.6.htm">17:6</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民18.17.htm">18:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民18.18.htm">18</a>）</p><p>“肥甘”（fat things，或译肥油，脂油，汁浆等）在反面意义上表示那些对良善感到恶心，并且因它太过丰盛而诅咒、弃绝它的人（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.13.htm">32:13</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.28.htm">5:28</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.11.htm">50:11</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗17.10.htm">17:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗20.3.htm">20:3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.31.htm">78:31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.70.htm">119:70</a>等）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 782</h4><p>782. <a href="3927/revelation_18_14.htm">18:14</a> "The fruits that your soul longed for have gone from you, and all things rich and splendid have gone from you, and you shall find them no more at all." This symbolically means that all the blessings and felicities of heaven, including the external ones they wish for, will altogether fly away and be seen no longer, because these Roman Catholics do not have in them any celestial or spiritual affections for goodness and truth.<p>Fruits that the soul longs for symbolize nothing else than the blessings and felicities of heaven, because those are the fruits of everything having to do with the doctrine and worship that are the subject here, and because they are what people desire when they are dying, and also what they continue to desire when they first come into the spiritual world.<p>Things rich and splendid symbolize celestial and spiritual affections for goodness and truth - rich things affections for goodness, as we will show below, and splendid things affections for truth, which are called splendid because they develop in response to the light of heaven and its splendor in human minds, giving rise to an understanding of goodness and truth and so to wisdom.<p>To go and not be found anymore means symbolically that the blessings and felicities of heaven will fly away and be seen no longer, because the people here do not have any celestial or spiritual goodness and truth. Moreover, the blessings and felicities that they long for are called external, because the only blessings and felicities and affections that they long for are carnal and worldly ones, and consequently they are incapable of knowing the nature and character of the blessings and felicities that are called celestial and spiritual.</p><p>[2] But we will illustrate this by disclosing the lot of those people after death. When people impelled by a love of dominion from a love of self and so by a love of the world come from that religion into the spiritual world, as they do immediately after death, they all yearn for nothing else than dominion and the pleasures of the heart resulting from that dominion, and the pleasures of the body resulting from wealth. For a person's reigning love with its affections or lusts and desires awaits everyone after death. However, because a love of exercising dominion, springing from a love of self, over the sanctities of the church and heaven, all of which are Divine and the Lord's, is diabolical, therefore after a period of time these people are separated from their companions and cast down into various hells.<p>But even so, because in consequence of their religion they have participated in an external worship of God, they are first taught the nature and character of heaven, and the nature and character of the happiness of eternal life, that its blessings are pure blessings flowing in from the Lord into everyone in heaven in accordance with the character of the heavenly affection for goodness and truth in them. Yet because they have not turned to the Lord and so have not been conjoined with Him, and also lack any such affection for goodness and truth, they reject that instruction and turn away, and long for the pleasures of the love of self and the world then, which are merely natural and carnal. But because it is inherent in those pleasures to do evil, especially to people who worship the Lord, thus to angels in heaven, therefore they are deprived of those pleasures also and are thrust among their comrades in infernal workhouses in a contemptible and wretched state.<p>Still, these events befall them to the degree of their love of dominion over things that are Divine and the Lord's, which is the degree to which they rejected the Lord.</p><p>[3] It can now be seen from this that "the fruits that your soul longed for have gone from you, and all things rich and splendid have gone from you, and you shall find them no more at all," symbolically means that all the blessings and felicities of heaven, including the external ones they wish for, will altogether fly away and be seen no longer, because these Roman Catholics do not have in them any affections for goodness and truth.<p>That rich things <sup>1</sup>symbolize heavenly goods, and also affections for those goods and the delights of those affections, can be seen from the following passages:<p>Listen... to Me, eat what is good, that your soul may delight itself in richness. (<a href="3927/isaiah_55_2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>)<p>I will fill the soul of the priests with richness, and My people shall be satisfied with... goodness... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_14.htm">Jeremiah 31:14</a>)<p>My soul shall be satisfied... with fatness and richness, and my mouth shall praise with singing lips. (<a href="3927/psalms_63_5.htm">Psalms 63:5</a>)<p>They are filled with the richness of Your house, and You give them drink from the river of Your delights. (<a href="3927/psalms_36_8.htm">Psalms 36:8</a>)<p>On this mountain Jehovah... will make for all people a feast of rich food..., of rich food full of marrow... (<a href="3927/isaiah_25_6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>)<p>They shall still have produce in old age; they shall be rich and green, to declare that Jehovah is upright. (<a href="3927/psalms_92_14.htm">Psalms 92:14-15</a>)<p>(In the feast that Jehovah will make) you shall eat rich food till you are full, and drink blood till you are drunk... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_39_19.htm">Ezekiel 39:19</a>)<p>(Jehovah) will regard your burnt offering as rich. (<a href="3927/psalms_20_3.htm">Psalms 20:3</a>)<p>Because richness of fat symbolizes heavenly goodness, it was therefore a statute in Israel that all the fat of sacrificial animals should be burnt on the altar (<a href="3927/exodus_29_13.htm">Exodus 29:13</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_29_22.htm">22</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_1_8.htm">Leviticus 1:8</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_3_3.htm">3:3-16</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_4_8.htm">4:8-35</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_7_3.htm">7:3-4</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_7_30.htm">30-31</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_17_6.htm">17:6</a>).<p>In an opposite sense, the richness of fat symbolizes people who are nauseated at goodness, and who, because it is just too much, scorn it and reject it (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_11.htm">50:11</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_17_10.htm">Psalms 17:10</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_20_3.htm">20:3</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_78_31.htm">78:31</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_119_70.htm">119:70</a>; and elsewhere).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Literally, "fat things." The original words in Hebrew and Greek, translated here as "rich" or "richness," mean literally "fat" or "fatness," but metaphorically "rich" or "richness." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 782</h4><p>782. [verse 14] 'And the fruits of the longing of thy soul have departed from thee, and all things fat and splendid have departed from thee, and thou shalt not find them any more' signifies that all the blessings and felicities of heaven, even such external ones as are desired by them, are going to flee away altogether and no longer appear, because there are not any celestial and spiritual affections of good and truth with them. By 'the fruits of the longing of the soul' nothing else is signified but the blessings and felicities of heaven, because these are the fruits of all the things of doctrine and worship that are treated of, and because they are the longings of men when they are dying and their longings also when they come fresh into the spiritual world. By 'things fat and splendid' are signified celestial and spiritual affections of good and truth; by 'fat things' affections of good, concerning which [something] follows, and by 'splendid things' affections of truth. These are termed 'splendid' because they come into existence out of the light of heaven and its brilliance in minds, whence are the intelligence of good and truth as well as wisdom. By 'to depart' and 'not to find them any more is signified that they are going to flee away and not make any further appearance, because they are not in any celestial and spiritual good and truth. It is said 'even such external ones as are desired by them' because by them are desired none but bodily and worldly blessings and felicities and affections, and consequently they cannot know what the ones that are called celestial and spiritual are, or what they are like.</p><p>[2] But let these things be illustrated by the disclosure of their lot after death. All those of that form of religion who have been in a love of dominion derived from the love of self and consequently in a love of the world, when they come into the spiritual world, which is immediately after death, do not breathe forth anything but dominion and the resulting pleasures of the mind (voluptates animi) and the pleasures of the body procurable by wealth; for the ruling love with its affections or lusts and desires remains with everyone after death. But because the love, derived from the love of self, of dominating over the holy things of the Church and heaven which all are the Lord's Divine things is diabolical, therefore after a certain time they are separated from their companions and cast down into hells. But still because they have been in an external worship derived from their form of religion they are first instructed as to what heaven is and what it is like also what the happiness of eternal life is and what it is like. [They are instructed] that there are pure blessings inflowing from the Lord with each and every one in heaven in accordance with the quality of the celestial affections of good and truth with them. But because they have not approached the Lord, and consequently have not been conjoined with Him, and also have not been in any such affection of good and truth, they are averse to them and turn themselves away. And then they desire the pleasures of the love of self and the world which are merely natural and bodily. But because it is inherent in those pleasures to do evil, especially to do it to those who worship the Lord, thus to the angels of heaven, therefore they are deprived of those pleasures also and are then rejected among their companions who are in contempt and misery in infernal workhouses. But these things are done to them in accordance with the degree of the love of dominion over the Lord's Divine things, in accordance with which degree is their rejection of the Lord.</p><p>[3] From these things it can now be established that by 'the fruits of the longing of thy soul have departed from thee, and all things fat and splendid have departed from thee, and thou shalt not find them any more' is signified that all the blessings and felicities of heaven, even such external ones as are desired by them, are going to flee away altogether and no longer appear because there are not any affections of good and truth with them. That 'fat things' signify celestial goods as well as the affections thereof and the delights of the affections, can be established from the following passages:<p>Pay attention unto Me, eat that which is good, that your soul may be delighted with fatness. <a href="3927/isaiah_55_2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>.<p>I will fill the soul of the priests with fatness, and My people shall be satisfied with good. <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_14.htm">Jeremiah 31:14</a>.<p>My soul shall be satisfied with grease and fatness, and my mouth shall praise with lips of songs. <a href="3927/psalms_63_5.htm">Psalms 63:5</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_63_6.htm">6</a>].<p>They are being filled with the fatness of Thy house, and Thou dost make them drink from the liver of Thy delights. <a href="3927/psalms_36_8.htm">Psalms 36:8</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_36_9.htm">9</a>].<p>Jehovah shall make for every people in this mountain a feast of fat things, of fat things full of marrow. <a href="3927/isaiah_25_6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>.<p>They shall still produce in old age, they shall be fat and green for proclaiming that Jehovah is upright. <a href="3927/psalms_92_14.htm">Psalms 92:14-15</a> [H.B. 15-16].<p>That in the feast that Jehovah shall make, they shall eat fatness till they are full and drink blood till they are drunken. <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_19.htm">Ezekiel 39:19</a>.<p>Jehovah will make fat thy burnt-offering. <a href="3927/psalms_20_3.htm">Psalms 20:3</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_20_4.htm">4</a>].<p>Because 'fatness' signifies celestial good, therefore there was a statute that 'all the fat out of the sacrifices should be burned upon the altar' (<a href="3927/exodus_29_13.htm">Exodus 29:13</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_29_22.htm">22</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_1_8.htm">Leviticus 1:8</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_3_3.htm">3:3-16</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_4_8.htm">4:8-35</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_7_3.htm">7:3-4</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_7_30.htm">30-31</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_17_6.htm">17:6</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_18_17.htm">Numbers 18:17-18</a>). In the opposite sense by 'fats' are signified those who are nauseated at goodness and condemn and reject it because there is too much (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_11.htm">50:11</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_17_10.htm">Psalms 17:10</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_20_3.htm">20:3</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_17_4.htm">4</a>]; <a href="3927/psalms_78_31.htm">78:31</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_119_70.htm">119:70</a>; and elsewhere). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 782</h4><p>782. Verse 14. And the fruits of the desire of thy soul have departed from thee, and all fat and splendid things have departed from thee, and thou shalt not find them anymore, signifies that all the beatitudes and felicities of heaven, even the external such as are desired by them, will altogether flee away, and will no longer appear, because they have no celestial and spiritual affections of good and truth. By "the fruits of the desire of the soul" nothing else is signified but the beatitudes and felicities of heaven, because these are the fruits of all the things of doctrine and worship, which are treated of, and because they are the desires of men when they die, and also their desires when they first come into the spiritual world. By things "fat and splendid" are signified celestial and spiritual affections of good and truth; by "fat things" the affections of good, as will be seen presently; and by "splendid things" the affections of truth, which are called "splendid," because they exist from the light of heaven and its splendor in minds; whence are the intelligence of good and truth and wisdom. By "departing and not finding them anymore" is signified that they will flee away and will not appear anymore, because they are not in any celestial and spiritual good and truth. This is said even of the external things, such as are desired by them; because no other beatitudes and felicities and affections are desired by them, but corporeal and worldly; and hence they cannot know what and of what quality those are which are called celestial and spiritual.</p><p>[2] But these things will be illustrated by a manifestation of their lot after death. All of that religious persuasion who have been in the love of dominion from the love of self, and thence in the love of the world, when they come into the spiritual world, which takes place immediately after death, aspire after nothing but dominion and the pleasures of the mind from it, and the pleasures of the body from opulence; for the ruling love, with its affections or lusts and desires, remains with everyone after death. But because the love of dominating from the love of self over the holy things of the church and of heaven, all of which are Divine things of the Lord, is diabolical, therefore, after a certain time, they are separated from their companions, and cast down into the hells. But still, because they have from their religious persuasion been in external Divine worship, they are first instructed as to what and of what quality heaven is, and what and of what quality the felicity of eternal life is, that they are mere beatitudes flowing in from the Lord with everyone in heaven according to the quality of the heavenly affection of good and truth with them. But because they have not approached the Lord, and hence are not conjoined with Him, and likewise have not been in any such affection of good and truth, they are averse to them, and turn themselves away, and then desire the pleasures of the love of self and the world, which are merely natural and corporeal. But because it is inherent in those pleasures to do evil, especially to those who worship the Lord, and thus to the angels of heaven, they are therefore deprived of these pleasures also, and are then rejected among companions who are in contempt and misery in infernal workhouses. But these things are done to them according to the degree of their love of dominion over the Divine things of the Lord, according to which degree is their rejection of the Lord.</p><p>[3] It may now be evident from these things, that by "the fruits of the desire of thy soul have departed, and all fat and splendid things have departed from thee, and thou shalt not find them anymore," is signified that all the beatitudes and felicities of heaven, even the external, such as are desired by them, will altogether flee away, and not appear anymore, because there are no affections of good and truth with them. That "fat things" signify celestial goods and their affections and the enjoyments of their affections, may be evident from the following passages:<p>Attend unto Me, eat ye that which is good, that your soul may be delighted with fatness, (<a href="3927/isaiah_55_2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>).<p>I will fill the soul of the priests with fatness, and My people shall be satisfied with good, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_14.htm">Jeremiah 31:14</a>).<p>My soul shall be satisfied with fatness and fat, and my mouth shall praise Thee with lips of singing, (<a href="3927/psalms_63_5.htm">Psalms 63:5</a>).<p>They shall be filled with the fatness of Thy house, and Thou shalt make them drink of the river of Thy delights, (<a href="3927/psalms_36_8.htm">Psalms 36:8</a>).<p>And in this mountain will Jehovah make to all peoples a feast of fat things, of fat things of marrow, (<a href="3927/isaiah_25_6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>).<p>They shall still have produce in old age, they shall be fat and green to show that Jehovah is upright, (<a href="3927/psalms_92_14.htm">Psalms 92:14-15</a>).<p>In the feast which Jehovah will make, they shall eat fatness to satiety, and shall drink blood to drunkenness, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_39_19.htm">Ezekiel 39:19</a>).<p>Jehovah will make fat thy burnt-offering, (<a href="3927/psalms_20_3.htm">Psalms 20:3</a>).<p>As fatness signifies celestial good, it was therefore a statute that:<p>All the fat of the sacrifices should be burned upon the altar, (<a href="3927/exodus_29_13.htm">Exodus 29:13</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_29_22.htm">22</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_1_8.htm">Leviticus 1:8</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_3_3.htm">3:3-16</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_4_8.htm">4:8-35</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_7_3.htm">7:3-4</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_7_30.htm">30-31</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_17_6.htm">17:6</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_18_17.htm">Numbers 18:17-18</a>).<p>By "fatness" in the opposite sense they are signified who are nauseated at good, and because it is very abundant, despise and reject it, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_11.htm">50:11</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_17_10.htm">Psalms 17:10</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_20_3.htm">20:3</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_78_31.htm">78:31</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_119_70.htm">119:70</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 782 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>782. (Vere. 14.) "Et fructus desiderii animae tuae abiverunt a te, et omnia pinguia et splendida abiverunt a te, et amplius non invenies illa," significat quod omnes beatitudines et felicitates Caeli, etiam externae quales ab illis cupiuntur, prorsus fugiturae sint, et non amplius appariturae, quia non aliquae affectiones boni et veri caelestes et spirituales apud illos.--Per "fructus desiderii animae" non aliud significatur quam beatitudines et felicitates Caeli, quia hae sunt fructus omnium doctrinae et cultus, de quibus actum est, et quia sunt desideria hominum quando moriuntur, et quoque desideria cum recentes in mundum spiritualem veniunt: per "pinguia, et splendida" significantur affectiones boni et veri caelestes et spirituales; per "pinguia" affectiones boni, de quibus sequitur, et per "splendida" affectiones veri, quae splendida dicuntur quia existunt ex luce Caeli et ejus splendore in mentibus, unde intelligentia boni et veri ac sapientia: per "abire et non invenire illa amplius" significatur quod fugiturae sint et non magis appariturae, quia illi non in aliquo bono et vero caelesti et spirituali sunt; quod etiam externae, quales ab illis cupiuntur, dicitur, quia non aliae beatitudines et felicitates et affectiones ab illis cupiuntur quam corporeae et mundanae, et inde non scire possunt quid et quales illae sunt quae vocantur caelestes et spirituales. <p>Sed haec illustrentur per detectionem sortis illorum post mortem. Omnes illi ex illo Religioso, qui in amore dominii ex amore sui et inde in amore mundi fuerunt, dum in mundum spiritualem veniunt, quod fit statim post mortem, non spirant aliud quam dominium ac voluptates animi ex illo, et voluptates corporis ex opulentia; amor enim regnans cum ejus affectionibus seu concupiscentiis et desideriis, manet unumquemvis post mortem. Sed quia amor dominandi ex amore sui super sancta Ecclesiae et Caeli, quae omnia sunt Divina Domini, est diabolicus, ideo post exactum tempus separantur a sociis, et dejiciuntur in Inferna. At usque, quia ex Religioso suo in externo cultu Divino fuerunt, primum instruuntur quid et quale Caelum est, ac quid et qualis felicitas vitae aeternae, quod sint merae beatitudines influentes a Domino apud unumquemvis in Caelo secundum quale affectionis boni et veri caelestis apud illos. Sed quia illi non adiverunt Dominum, et inde non conjuncti sunt cum Ipso, et quoque non in aliqua tali affectione boni et veri fuerunt, aversantur illa, et avertunt se, et tunc cupiunt voluptates amoris sui et mundi, quae sunt mere naturales et corporeae. Sed quia illis voluptatibus insitum est malefacere, imprimis illis qui colunt Dominum, ita angelis Caeli, ideo etiam illis voluptatibus deprivantur, et tunc rejiciuntur inter socios qui in ergastulis infernalibus in contemptu et miseria sunt: sed haec fiunt illis secundum gradum amoris dominii super Divina Domini, secundum quem gradum est illis rejectio Domini. <p>Ex his nunc constare potest, quod per "fructus desiderii animae tuae abiverunt, et omnia pinguia et splendida abiverunt a te, et amplius non invenies illa," significetur quod omnes beatitudines et felicitates Caeli, etiam externae, quales ab illis cupiuntur, prorsus fugiturae sint et non amplius appariturae, quia non aliquae affectiones boni et veri sunt apud illos. Quod "pinguia" significent bona caelestia ac eorum affectiones et affectionum jucunditates, constare potest ex sequentibus locis: <p>"Attendite ad Me, comedite bonum, ut delicietur in Pinguedine anima vestra," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_782/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_55_2" target=_top>Esaias 55:2</a>);<p>"Implebo animam sacerdotum Pinguedine, et populus Meus Bono saturabitur," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_782/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_31_14" target=_top>Jeremias 31:14</a>);<p>"Adipe et Pinguedine saturabitur anima mea, et labiis canticorum laudabit os meum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_782/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_63_6" target=_top>Psalm 63:6</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_782/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_63_5" target=_top>5</a>));<p>"Implentur Pinguedine domus Tuae, et flumine deliciarum Tuarum potas eos," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_782/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_36_9" target=_top>Psalm 36:9</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_782/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_36_8" target=_top>8</a>));<p>"Faciet Jehovah omnibus populis in Monte hoc convivium Pinguedinum, Pinguedinum medullatarum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_782/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_25_6" target=_top>Esaias 25:6</a>);<p>"Adhuc proventum habebunt in senio, Pingues et virides erunt, ad annuntiandum quod rectus Jehovah," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_782/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_92_15" target=_top>Psalm 92:15</a>, 16 (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_782/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_92_14-15" target=_top>14-15</a>));<p>Quod in convivio quod Jehovah faciet, comedent Pinguedinem ad satietatem, et bibent Sanguinem ad ebrietatem, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_782/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_39_19" target=_top>Ezechiel 39:19</a>);<p>"Jehovah holocaustum tuum Pingue faciet," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_782/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_20_4" target=_top>Psalm 20:4</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_782/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_20_3" target=_top>3</a>)).<p>Quia "pinguedo" significat bonum caeleste, ideo statutum fuit Ut omnis Pinguedo ex sacrificatis super Altari adoleretur, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_782/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_29_13" target=_top>Exodus 29:13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_782/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_29_22" target=_top>22</a>;
