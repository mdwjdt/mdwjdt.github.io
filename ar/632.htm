<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 632</h4><p>632. "Because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her licentiousness." This symbolically means, because by profanations of the Word and adulterations of the church's goodness and truth, it has led astray all the people it was able to bring under its dominion.<p>Babylon symbolizes the Roman Catholic religion, as above. Wine symbolizes truth springing from goodness, and in an opposite sense, falsity arising from evil (no. <a href="316.htm">316</a>). Licentiousness then symbolizes the falsification of truth, and the wrath of her licentiousness symbolizes its adulteration and profanation (no. <a href="134.htm">134</a>). To make all nations drink means, symbolically, to lead astray all the people they were able to bring under their dominion - making to drink of that wine symbolizing to lead astray, and nations symbolizing people who are under their sway. </p>

'Because she has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom' signifies because by profanations of the Word and by adulterations of the good and truth of the Church it has led astray all whom it has been able to bring under its dominion. By 'Babylon' is signified the Roman Catholic form of religion, as above. 'Wine' signifies truth derived from good, and in the opposite sense untruth derived from evil (<a href="316.htm">316</a>); and 'whoredom' signifies the falsification of truth, and 'the wrath of whoredom' signifies adulteration and profanation (<a href="134.htm">134</a>). 'To make all the nations drink' signifies to lead astray all whom they have been able to bring under their dominion. By 'to make to drink of that wine' is signified to lead astray, and by 'the nations are signified those who are under their authority. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 632</h4><p>632. Because she made all nations drink of the wine of the anger of her whoredom, signifies, because by profanations of the Word, and adulterations of the good and truth of the church, she has seduced all whom she could subject to her dominion. By "Babylon" is signified the Roman Catholic religion as above. "Wine" signifies truth from good, and, in the opposite sense, falsity from evil, (<a href="316.htm">316</a>); and "whoredom" signifies the falsification of truth, and the "anger of whoredom" signifies adulteration and profanation, (<a href="134.htm">134</a>).
