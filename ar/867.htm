<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第867节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>867.“案卷展开了，并且另有一卷展开，就是生命册”表他们的心智内层全都被敞开，藉着天上来的光与热的流注，他们在属于爱或意愿的情感，因而在属于信或理解的思维方面的性质，都被看到和察觉，无论善人还是恶人。“案卷”不是指书卷，而是指那些受审判之人的心智内层；“案卷”表示那些邪恶之人的心智内层，他们被判为死；“生命册”表示善人的心智内层，他们被判为生。他们之所以被称为“案卷”，是因为每个人在世时出于意愿或爱，因而出于理解或信仰所曾思想、意图、言说和践行过的一切事都被刻写在其心智内层中；所有这些事都被铭刻在每个人的生命上，并且如此精准，以致毫无缺失。当属灵之光，也就是来自主的智慧，和属灵之热，也就是来自主的爱经由天堂流入时，所有这些事的性质都活生生地呈现出来。属灵之光显明属于理解和信仰的思维，属灵之热则显明属于意愿和爱的情感；属灵之光和属灵之热一起显明意图和努力。我不是说理性人靠着自己的理解之光就能看出这一事实；而是说，若愿意，他有这种能力，只要他愿意明白，启示理解或认知的是所赋予的属灵之光，点燃意愿的，是所赋予的属灵之热。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 867</h4><p>867. And their books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. This symbolically means that the interiors of their minds were opened, of both the good and the evil, and by an influx of light and warmth from heaven their characters were seen and perceived in respect to the affections of their love or will, and so in respect to the thoughts of their faith or intellect.<p>The books do not mean books, but the interiors of the minds of those being judged. The books symbolize the interiors of the minds of those who were evil and who received a verdict of death, and the Book of Life symbolizes those who were good and who received a verdict of life.<p>The interiors are called books because the interiors of everyone's mind have inscribed on them everything the person thought, intended, said and did in the world that proceeded from his will or love and so from his intellect or faith. All of this is inscribed on everyone's life so precisely that nothing at all is lost.<p>The character of these interiors is clearly apparent when spiritual light, which is wisdom from the Lord, and spiritual warmth, which is love from the Lord, flow in through heaven. Spiritual light reveals the thoughts that are matters of the intellect and faith; spiritual warmth reveals the affections that are matters of the will and love; and spiritual light and warmth together reveal the intentions and endeavors.<p>I do not say that a rational person can see the reality of this by the light of his own intellect, but he can see it if he wishes to, provided he is willing to understand that there exists a spiritual light that enlightens the intellect, and a spiritual warmth that kindles the will. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 867</h4><p>867. 'And the books were opened, and another book was of the mind of all of them were laid open, and by means opened which is of life' signifies that the interior things of the influx of light and heat out of heaven it was seen and perceived what they were like as to the affections that are of the love or of the will, and consequently as to the thoughts that are of faith or of the understanding, the evil as well as the good. By 'the books' are not understood books but the interior things of the mind of those who are being judged, by the books' the interior things of the mind of those who are evil and are being judged to death, and by 'the book of life' those who are good and are judged to life. They are termed 'books' because in the interior things of the mind of every one have been inscribed all the things that each one has thought, intended, spoken and done out of the will or love, and consequently out of the understanding or faith. All these things are inscribed on the life of every one with so much exactness that nothing at all is missing. These things appear as to their qualities with lifelike reality when the spiritual light that is wisdom from the Lord and the spiritual heat that is love from the Lord inflow through heaven. The spiritual light discloses the thoughts that are of the understanding and faith, and the spiritual heat discloses the affections that are of the will and love; while the spiritual light and spiritual heat together disclose the intentions and endeavours. 'That this is the case, I do not say that a rational man can see out of the light of his own understanding; but he can see if he will, provided he is willing to understand that there exists a spiritual light that illumines the understanding and a spiritual heat that enkindles the will. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 867</h4><p>867. And the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life, signifies that the interiors of the minds of them all were laid open, and by the influx of light and heat from heaven their quality was seen and perceived, as to the affections which are of the love or will, and thence as to the thoughts which are of faith or of the understanding, as well the evil as the good. By "books" are not meant books, but the interiors of the minds of those who are judged, by "the books," the interiors of the minds of those who are evil, and are judged to death, and by "the book of life" such as are good, and are judged to life. They are called "books," because in the interiors of the mind of everyone are inscribed all the things that he thought, intended, spoke, and did in the world from the will or the love, and thence from the understanding or faith; all these things are inscribed on the life of everyone, with so much exactness that not one of them is wanting. The quality of all these things appears to the life, when spiritual light, which is wisdom from the Lord, and spiritual heat, which is love from the Lord, flow in through heaven. Spiritual light discloses the thoughts which are of the understanding and faith, and spiritual heat discloses the affections which are of the will and love; and spiritual light together with spiritual heat disclose the intentions and endeavors. That this is the case, I do not say that the rational man can see from the light of his own understanding; but he can if he will, provided he be willing to understand that there is given spiritual light which enlightens the understanding, and spiritual heat which enkindles the will. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 867 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>867. "Et libri aperti sunt, et Liber alius apertus est qui est vitae," significat quod interiora mentis omnium illorum reclusa sint, et per influxum lucis et caloris e Caelo visi et percepti quales essent quoad affectiones quae amoris seu voluntatis, et inde quoad cogitationes quae fidei seu intellectus, tam mali quam boni. - Per "libros" non intelliguntur libri, sed interiora mentis illorum qui judicantur; per "libros" interiora mentis illorum qui mali sunt et judicantur ad mortem, et per "Librum vitae" qui boni sunt et judicantur ad vitam. Dicuntur "libri," quia interioribus mentis cujusvis inscripta sunt omnia quae quisque ex voluntate seu amore, et inde ex intellectu seu fide, in mundo cogitavit, intendit, locutus est, et fecit; haec omnia sunt vitae cujusvis inscripta, ita ad amussim ut prorsus nihil desit. Haec ad vivum apparent qualia sunt, quando lux spiritualis, quae est sapientia a Domino, et calor spiritualis, qui est amor a Domino, per Caelum influunt; lux spiritualis detegit cogitationes quae sunt intellectus et fidei, et calor spiritualis detegit affectiones quae sunt voluntatis et amoris; ac lux spiritualis et simul calor spiritualis detegunt intentiones et conatus: quod ita sit, non dico quod rationalis homo possit ex luce intellectus sui videre; nam potest si vult, modo velit intelligere quod detur lux spiritualis quae illuminat intellectum, et calor spiritualis qui accendit voluntatem. </p>
