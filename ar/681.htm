<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第681节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>681.“海就变成好像死人的血，海中一切活着的灵魂都死了”表他们当中的地狱虚假，圣言、因而教会和信仰的一切真理都被它们灭绝了。“好像死人的血”或血块和血腥物表示地狱的虚假；因为“血”表示神性真理，在反面意义上表示被歪曲的神性真理（<a href="379.htm">379</a>节）；但“好像死人的血”表示地狱的虚假，因为“死”表示属灵生命的灭绝，因而“死人”表示地狱的东西（<a href="321.htm">321</a>，<a href="525.htm">525</a>节）。“一切活着的灵魂都死了”表示圣言、教会和信仰的一切真理都被灭绝了，因为“活着的灵魂”表示信仰的真理，“活着的灵魂死了”表示信之真理的灭绝。在圣言中，“灵魂”当论及人时，表示他的属灵生命，也也 就是其理解或认知的生命；由于理解或认知通过真理而成为理解或认知，而真理属于信仰，所以“灵魂”表示信仰的真理。这就是“灵魂”的含义，这一点从圣言中的许多经文，以及论及灵魂和心的地方明显看出来。显然，“灵魂和心”是指人的生命，但人的生命来自意愿和理解或认知，从属灵的角度来说，来自爱与智慧，也来自仁与信；来自爱或仁之良善的意愿生命由“心”来表示，来自智慧或信之真理的理解或认知由“灵魂”来表示。这就是相关经文（如马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.37.htm">22:37</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.30.htm">12:30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.33.htm">33</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.27.htm">10:27</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.5.htm">6:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申10.12.htm">10:12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.13.htm">11:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申26.16.htm">26:16</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.41.htm">32:41</a>等，在这些经文中灵魂，即soul经常译为“性命”）中“灵魂和心”的意思。在单独提及“心”的经文和单独提及“灵魂”的经文中，它们的意思也一样。以名字区别它们是由于心与意愿并爱相对应，肺呼吸与理解或认知并智慧相对应，这一点可见于《圣爱与圣智》第五章，那里论述了对应。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 681</h4><p>681. And it became blood as though of a dead man, and every living creature in the sea died. This symbolizes the infernal falsity in those people by which every truth in the Word was extinguished, and so also every truth in the church and in faith.<p>Blood as though of a dead man, or blood oozing and mixed with pus, symbolizes infernal falsity. For blood symbolizes Divine truth, and in an opposite sense, that truth falsified (no. <a href="379.htm">379</a>). But blood as though of a dead man symbolizes infernal falsity, inasmuch as death symbolizes the extinction of spiritual life, and so a dead man symbolizes something infernal (nos. <a href="321.htm">321</a>, <a href="525.htm">525</a>). That every living creature died means symbolically that every truth in the Word, in the church, and in faith was extinguished. For a living creature symbolizes the truth of faith; accordingly a living creature that has died symbolizes the truth of faith extinguished.<p>A living creature in the Word, or a soul when referring to a human being, symbolizes his spiritual life, which is also the life of his intellect; and because the intellect is formed by truths, and truths have to do with faith, therefore a living creature or soul symbolizes the truth of faith. That this is the symbolic meaning of a living creature or soul can be seen from many passages in the Word, and also from those that mention both soul and heart. The soul and heart plainly mean a person's life, but it is his life in consequence of his will and intellect, or spiritually speaking, in consequence of his love and wisdom, or of his charity and faith; and the life of the will springing from the goodness of love is meant by heart, while the life of the intellect springing from truths of wisdom or of faith is meant by soul. These are meant by soul and heart in <a href="3927/matthew_22_37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>, <a href="3927/mark_12_30.htm">Mark 12:30</a>, <a href="3927/mark_12_33.htm">33</a>, <a href="3927/luke_10_27.htm">Luke 10:27</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_6_5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_10_12.htm">10:12</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_11_13.htm">11:13</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_26_16.htm">26:16</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_32_41.htm">Jeremiah 32:41</a>; and elsewhere. Also in passages which mention heart by itself and soul by itself.<p>The reason these terms are used comes from the correspondence of the heart with the will and love, and of the soul's action in the lungs with the intellect and wisdom, as may be seem in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom, Section Five, where this correspondence is discussed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 681</h4><p>681. 'And it became blood as of one dead, and every living soul died in the sea' signifies infernal untruth with them by which every truth of the Word, and consequently of the Church and of faith, has been extinguished. By 'blood as of one dead,' or by gore and bloody matter, is signified infernal untruth; for by 'blood' is signified Divine Truth, and in the opposite sense that falsified (<a href="379.htm">379</a>), but by 'blood as of one dead' is signified infernal untruth; for by 'death' is signified the extinction of spiritual life, and consequently by 'one dead' is signified what is infernal (<a href="321.htm">321</a>, <a href="525.htm">525</a>). By [its being said] that 'every living soul died' is signified that every truth of the Word, of the Church, and of faith, has been extinguished; for by a 'living soul' is signified the truth of faith. Consequently by a 'living soul dead' is signified the truth of faith extinguished. By 'soul' in the Word, where it relates to a man, is signified the life of his spirit, which is also the life of his understanding; and because the understanding is the understanding by virtue of truths, and truths are of faith, therefore by 'soul' is signified the truth of faith. That this is signified by 'soul' can be established from many passages in the Word, and also from those where 'soul and heart' is said. It is plain that by 'soul and heart' is understood a man's life, but his life is derived from the will and from the understanding, or spiritually speaking is from love and wisdom, also from charity and faith; and the life of the will derived from the good of love or charity is understood by heart,' while the life of the understanding derived from truths of wisdom or of faith is understood by 'soul.' These are understood by 'heart' and 'soul' in <a href="3927/matthew_22_37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>; <a href="3927/mark_12_30.htm">Mark 12:30</a>, <a href="3927/mark_12_33.htm">33</a>; <a href="3927/luke_10_27.htm">Luke 10:27</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_6_5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_10_12.htm">10:12</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_11_13.htm">11:13</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_26_16.htm">26:16</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_32_41.htm">Jeremiah 32:41</a>; and elsewhere; also in places where 'heart' by itself and 'soul' by itself is said. That the cause of their distinction by name is the result of the correspondence of the heart with the will and with love, and of the living activity (animatio) of the lungs with the understanding and with wisdom, may be seen in ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM, Part V, where it treats of that correspondence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 681</h4><p>681. And it became blood as of one dead, and every living soul died in the sea, signifies infernal falsity with them, by which every truth of the Word, and thence of the church, and of faith, is extinguished. By "blood as of one dead," or by gore and matter, is signified infernal falsity; for by "blood" is signified the Divine truth, and, in the opposite sense, the same falsified, (<a href="379.htm">379</a>[1-7], but by "blood as of one dead," is signified infernal falsity, for by "death" is signified the extinction of spiritual life, and thence by "dead" is signified what is infernal, (<a href="321.htm">321</a>, <a href="525.htm">525</a>). By "every living soul died," is signified that every truth of the Word, of the church, and of faith was extinguished, for by "living soul" is signified the truth of faith, and by "the living soul died," is signified the extinction of the truth of faith. By "soul" in the Word, when spoken of man, is signified his spiritual life, which also is the life of his understanding, and as the understanding is the understanding from truths, and truths are of faith, therefore by "soul" is signified the truth of faith. That this is the signification of "soul" may appear from many passages in the Word, and also from those where soul and heart are spoken of. That by "soul and heart" is meant the life of man, is evident, but his life is from the will and the understanding, or spiritually speaking, from love and wisdom, then from charity and faith; and the life of the will from the good of love, or of charity, is meant by "the heart," and the life of the understanding from the truths of wisdom or of faith, is meant by "the soul." This is what is meant by "soul and heart" in <a href="3927/matthew_22_37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>; <a href="3927/mark_12_30.htm">Mark 12:30</a>, <a href="3927/mark_12_33.htm">33</a>; <a href="3927/luke_10_27.htm">Luke 10:27</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_6_5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_10_12.htm">10:12</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_11_13.htm">11:13</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_26_16.htm">26:16</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_32_41.htm">Jeremiah 32:41</a>, and in other places. It is the same in those passages where "the heart" is mentioned by itself, and "the soul" by itself. That the reason of their being named is from the correspondence of the heart with the will and love, and of the respiration of the lungs with the understanding and wisdom, may be seen in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom, chapter 5 (<a href="../dlw/371.htm">Divine Love and Wisdom 371-431</a>), where that correspondence is treated of. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 681 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>681. "Et factus est sanguis tanquam mortui, et omnis anima viva mortua est in mari," significat apud illos falsum infernale, per quod omne verum Verbi et inde Ecclesiae et fidei, exstinctum est. -Per "sanguinem tanquam mortui" seu per cruorem et saniem significatur falsum infernale; per "sanguinem" enim significatur Divinum Verum, et in opposito sensu illud falsificatum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_681/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_379" target=_top>379</a>); sed per "sanguinem sicut mortui" significatur falsum infernale, nam per "mortem" significatur exstinctio vitae spiritualis, et inde per "mortuum" significatur infernale (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_681/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_321" target=_top>321</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_681/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525" target=_top>525</a>); per quod "omnis anima viva mortua sit" significatur quod omne verum Verbi, Ecclesiae et fidei exstinctum sit; per "animam vivam" enim significatur verum fidei, inde per "animam vivam mortuam" significatur verum fidei exstinctum. Per "animam" in Verbo, ubi de homine, significatur vita spiritualis ejus, quae etiam est vita intellectus ejus; et quia intellectus est intellectus ex veris, et vera sunt fidei, ideo per "animam" significatur verum fidei; quod per "animam" hoc significetur, constare potest ex multis locis in Verbo, et quoque ex illis ubi dicitur "anima et cor." Quod per "animam et cor" intelligatur vita hominis, patet; sed vita ejus est ex voluntate et ex intellectu, aut spiritualiter loquendo est ex amore et sapientia, tum ex charitate et fide; ac vita voluntatis ex bono amoris seu charitatis intelligitur per "cor," ac vita intellectus ex veris sapientiae seu fidei, intelligitur per "animam." Haec per "animam et cor" intelliguntur, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_681/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_22_37" target=_top>Matthaeus 22:37</a>; <sup>1</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_681/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_12_30" target=_top>Marcus 12:30</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_681/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_12_33" target=_top>33</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_681/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_10_27" target=_top>Luca 10:27</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_681/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_6_5" target=_top>Deuteronomius 6:5</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_681/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_10_12" target=_top>10:12</a>; <sup>2</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_681/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_11_13" target=_top>11:13</a>; <sup>3</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_681/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_26_16" target=_top>26:16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_681/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_32_41" target=_top>Jeremias 32:41</a>; et alibi; <p>etiam in locis ubi "cor" per se, et "anima" per se, dicitur. Quod causa denominationis illorum sit ex correspondentia Cordis cum Voluntate et Amore, ac Animationis Pulmonis cum Intellectu et Sapientia, videri potest in Sapientia Angelica de Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia (Classe Quinta), ubi de correspondentia illa actum est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;37 pro "3"<p>2.&nbsp;12 pro "11"<p>3.&nbsp;13 pro "14" </p>
