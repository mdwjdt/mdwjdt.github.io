<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第444节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>444.启9:14.“把那捆绑在幼发拉底大河的四个使者释放了”表要除去他们的外在约束，好叫其心智的内层显现出来。若不知道“幼发拉底大河”和捆绑在那里的“四个使者”是什么意思，没有人知道，甚至几乎没有人猜出这就是这些话的含义。在圣言中，“幼发拉底河”表示人心智的内层，也就是所谓的理性事物，对那些处于源自良善的真理之人来说，这些内层充满智慧，但对那些陷入源自邪恶的虚假之人来说，这些内层则充满愚蠢。在圣言中，“幼发拉底河”之所以表示这些，是因为这条河将迦南地与亚述分开；而“迦南地”表示教会，“亚述”表示教会的理性；因此，形成其边界的这条河就表示两种意义上的心智内层，也就是所谓的理性。有三样事物构成教会之人，即：属灵之物，理性或智识之物，以及属世之物，也就是人的知识。教会的属灵之物由“迦南地”及其河流来表示；教会的理性或智识之物由“亚述”及其“幼发拉底河”表示；教会的属世之物，也就是人的知识，由“埃及”及其“尼罗河”来表示；有关这些的详细内容，可参看下文（<a href="503.htm">503</a>节）。“捆绑在幼发拉底河的四个使者”表示教会之人里面的这些内层，经上之所以说它们被“捆绑”了，是因为它们没有公开；事实上，他们是地狱灵，以“四个使者”来表示，因为下文论到他们说“他们预备要杀人的三分之一部分”（<a href="446.htm">446</a>节），人的内层与灵人合而为一，要么与地狱的灵，或天上的灵，因为它们同居在一起；“释放他们”表示除去外在约束，好叫其心智的内层显现出来。这就是这些话的含义。</p><p>“幼发拉底河”表示人心智的内层，该内层接近其教会的属灵之物，这一点从圣言中提及“亚述”的地方明显看出来；但在以下经文中，“幼发拉底河”以反面意义出现，表示充满虚假、因而充满愚蠢的内层：</p><p>看哪，神必使大河（即幼发拉底河）的水，又强又多的水，起来漫过你们；就是亚述王，他必冲入犹大，涨溢泛滥。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛8.7.htm">8:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛8.8.htm">8</a>）</p><p>现今你为何在埃及路上要喝西曷的水呢？你为何在亚述路上要喝大河（即幼发拉底河）的水呢？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.18.htm">2:18</a>）</p><p>耶和华必诅咒埃及的海汊，在幼发拉底河之上抡手。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.15.htm">11:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.16.htm">16</a>）</p><p>第六位天使把碗倒在幼发拉底大河上，河水就干了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.12.htm">16:12</a>）</p><p>先知耶利米被吩咐去买一根腰带束腰，然后将它藏在幼发拉底河附近的磐石穴中，不久他又取出来，看哪，腰带已经腐烂，毫无用处了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.1.htm">13:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.11.htm">11</a>）</p><p>他还被吩咐读完书卷后，将书扔在幼发拉底河中间，并说，巴比伦必如此沉下去、不再兴起。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.63.htm">51:63</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.64.htm">64</a>）</p><p>这些事代表以色列人当中的教会状态的内在。“埃及的河”，就是尼罗河，和“亚述的河”，就是幼发拉底河是迦南地的边界。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>耶和华与亚伯兰立约，说，我已将这片地赐给你的种，从埃及河直到大河，幼发拉底河。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.18.htm">15:18</a>）</p><p>幼发拉底河是一个边界（参看出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.31.htm">23:31</a> ；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申1.7.htm">1:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申1.8.htm">8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.24.htm">11:24</a>；约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书1.4.htm">1:4</a>；弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.12.htm">7:12</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 444</h4><p>444. "Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates. This symbolically means, to remove from them external bonds, to enable the interiors of their minds to appear.<p>It is impossible for anyone to know that this is the symbolic meaning of these words, and scarcely possible for anyone to suspect it, if he does not know what is meant by the great river Euphrates, and by the four angels bound there.<p>In the Word, the Euphrates symbolizes the inner constituents of the human mind, called rational, which in people governed by truths springing from goodness are full of wisdom, but which in people caught up in falsities springing from evil are full of irrationality.<p>This is the symbolic meaning of the river Euphrates in the Word. The reason is that this river formed the boundary between the land of Canaan and Assyria, and the land of Canaan symbolized the church, and Assyria its rational component. Therefore the river that formed the boundary between them symbolizes the inner constituents of the mind called rational, and this in both senses. For there are three components that form the person of the church: the spiritual component; the rational or intellectual component; and the natural component, which is one of knowledge. The spiritual component of the church is symbolized by the land of Canaan and its rivers; the rational or intellectual component of the church by Asshur or Assyria and its river, the Euphrates; and the natural component of the church, which is one of knowledge, by Egypt and its river, the Nile. But for more on this subject, see no. <a href="503.htm">503</a> below.<p>The four angels bound at the river Euphrates symbolize these interior constituents in people of the church, and they are said to be bound because they are kept hidden from public view. For it is hellish spirits that are meant by these four angels, inasmuch as we are told that they were prepared to kill a third of mankind, as we will presently see in no. <a href="446.htm">446</a>; and people's inner constituents are affiliated with spirits, either hellish ones or heavenly ones, since they dwell together. To release them means, symbolically, to remove external bonds, to enable the interiors of their minds to appear.<p>This is the symbolic meaning of these words.</p><p>[2] That the Euphrates symbolizes the interiors of a person's mind coextensive with the spiritual tenets of his church can be seen from passages in the Word where Asshur or Assyria are mentioned. In the following passages, however, the Euphrates occurs in an opposite sense, in which it symbolizes interiors full of falsities and thus insanities:<p>...behold, (God) is causing to rise up upon them the waters of the River (Euphrates), strong and mighty - the king of Asshur... It will pass through Judah, flood it and pass over it... (<a href="3927/isaiah_8_7.htm">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>)<p>...why take the road to Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? Or why take the road to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River? (<a href="3927/jeremiah_2_18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>)<p>Jehovah will devote to destruction the tongue of the Sea of Egypt; ...He will shake His hand over the River (Euphrates).... (<a href="3927/isaiah_11_15.htm">Isaiah 11:15-16</a>)<p>The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the... river Euphrates, and its water was dried up... (<a href="3927/revelation_16_12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>)<p>The prophet Jeremiah was commanded to put a sash around his loins, and afterward to hide it in a hole in a rock by the Euphrates; and when, after a short time, he recovered it, behold, it was ruined and profitable for nothing (<a href="3927/jeremiah_13_1.htm">Jeremiah 13:1-7</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_13_11.htm">11</a>).<p>The same prophet was also commanded, after he had finished reading a book, to throw it into the middle of the Euphrates and say, "Thus shall Babylon sink and not rise" (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_63.htm">Jeremiah 51:63-64</a>).<p>These events represented the interior qualities of the state of the church among the children of Israel.<p>That the river Nile in Egypt and the river Euphrates in Assyria were boundaries of the land of Canaan is apparent from the following verse:<p>...Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your offspring I will give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river... Euphrates." (<a href="3927/genesis_15_18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>)<p>To be shown that the Euphrates was one boundary, see <a href="3927/exodus_23_31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_1_7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7-8</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_11_24.htm">11:24</a>, <a href="3927/joshua_1_4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a>, <a href="3927/micah_7_12.htm">Micah 7:12</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 444</h4><p>444. 'Release the four angels bound at the great river Euphrates' signifies that external bonds should be taken away from them so that the interiors of their minds might appear. That these things are signified by these words no one can know, and scarcely can suspect, unless he knows what is understood by 'the great river Euphrates,' and what by 'the four angels bound' there. By 'Euphrates' in the Word the interiors of a man's mind are signified, that are called rational; and in the case of those who are in truths derived from good these are full of wisdom, but in the case of those who are in untruths derived from evil they are full of insanity. The reason why these [interiors] are signified by 'the river Euphrates' in the Word is because that river used to form the boundary between the land of Canaan and Assyria, and by 'the land of Canaan' was signified the Church, and by 'Assyria' the rational thereof. Consequently by the river acting as a boundary the interiors of the mind that are called rational, in either sense, are signified. There are three things that make the man of the Church, the spiritual, the rational or intellectual, and the natural that is also the [man's] knowledge. The spiritual of the Church was signified by the land of Canaan and by the rivers therein, the rational or intellectual of the Church by Asshur or Assyria and by its river Euphrates, while the natural that is also the knowledge was signified by Egypt and its river Nile; but concerning these more may be seen below (<a href="503.htm">503</a>). By 'the four angels bound at the river Euphrates' are signified those interiors with the men of the Church which are said to be 'bound' because they are not made public; for they are infernal spirits who are understood by these 'angels,' because it is said of them that 'they were prepared to slay a third part of the men,' as presently follows (<a href="446.htm">446</a>), and the interiors of men make one with spirits, either infernal or heavenly, since they dwell together. By 'release them' is signified to take away external bonds so that the interiors of their minds may appear. These are the things that are signified by these words.</p><p>[2] That by 'Euphrates' are signified the interiors of a man's mind bordering upon the spiritual things of his Church, can be established from passages in the Word where Asshur or Assyria is named; but 'Euphrates' occurs in an opposite sense, in which it signifies interiors full of untruths and the resultant insanities, in these places:<p>Behold the Lord brings up upon them the waters of the river (Euphrates), strong and many, the king of Asshur, he shall go through Judah, he shall overflow and go over. <a href="3927/isaiah_8_7.htm">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>.<p>What hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, that thou drinkest the waters of Sichor, and what hast thou to do with the way of Assyria, that thou drinkest the waters of the river? <a href="3927/jeremiah_2_18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>.<p>Jehovah shall devote the tongue of the Egyptian sea to destruction, and shall shake [His] hand over the river Euphrates. <a href="3927/isaiah_11_15.htm">Isaiah 11:15-16</a>.<p>The sixth angel poured out the phial upon the river Euphrates, the water of which was dried up. <a href="3927/revelation_16_12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>.<p>It was commanded to the prophet that he should put a girdle upon his loins, and afterwards should hide it in a hole of the rock by the Euphrates, and when after a short time he took it back, behold it was rotten, nor was it good for anything. <a href="3927/jeremiah_13_1.htm">Jeremiah 13:1-7</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_13_11.htm">11</a>.<p>And it was also commanded him that after he should finish reading the book, he should cast it into the midst of the Euphrates, and he should say, Thus shall Babel be sunk and not rise again. <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_63.htm">Jeremiah 51:63-64</a>.<p>By these things the interiors of the state of the Church with the sons of Israel were represented. That 'the river of Egypt' the Nile, and 'the river of Assyria' the Euphrates, were boundaries of the land of Canaan is plain from these words:<p>Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, Unto thy seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt even to the great river Euphrates. <a href="3927/genesis_15_18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>.<p>That the Euphrates was a boundary may be seen (<a href="3927/exodus_23_31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_1_7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7-8</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_11_24.htm">11:24</a>; <a href="3927/joshua_1_4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a>; <a href="3927/micah_7_12.htm">Micah 7:12</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 444</h4><p>444. Loose the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates, signifies that external bonds should be removed from them, that the interiors of their minds might appear. That this is the signification of these words, no one can know, and scarcely can suspect, unless he knows what is meant by "the great river Euphrates," and what by "the four angels bound there." By "Euphrates," in the Word, are signified the interiors of man's mind, which are called things rational, which, with those who are in truths from good, are full of wisdom, but in those who are in falsities from evil, are full of insanity. The reason why these are signified in the Word by "the river Euphrates," is, because that river divided the land of Canaan from Assyria; and by "the land of Canaan" was signified the church; and by "Assyria," its rational; and thence by the river which bounded it, are signified the interiors of the mind which are called rational, in both senses. For there are three things which constitute the man of the church, the spiritual, the rational or intellectual, and the natural, which is also the scientific. The spiritual of the church was signified by "the land of Canaan" and its rivers; the rational or intellectual of the church, by "Ashur" or "Assyria" and its "river Euphrates;" and the natural, which is also the scientific of the church, by "Egypt" and its "river" the Nile; but concerning these more may be seen below, (<a href="503.htm">503</a>). By "the four angels bound at the river Euphrates," are signified those interiors with the men of the church which are said "to be bound," because they are not openly avowed; for they are infernal spirits, who are meant by these four angels, since it is said of them, in what follows, (<a href="446.htm">446</a>), that "they were prepared to kill the third part of men," and the interiors of men make one with spirits, either infernal or celestial, because they cohabit: by "loosing them" is signified to remove external bonds, that the interiors of their minds may appear. Such is the signification of these words.</p><p>[2] By "Euphrates" are signified the interiors of man's mind bordering upon the spiritual things of his church, may appear from those passages in the Word where "Ashur" or "Assyria" is mentioned; but "Euphrates" occurs in the opposite sense, in which it signifies the interiors full of falsities and thence of insanities, in these passages:<p>Behold, God bringeth up over them the waters of the river (Euphrates) strong and many; the King of Assyria, he shall go through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, (<a href="3927/isaiah_8_7.htm">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>).<p>What hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, that thou drinkest the waters of Sihor? and what hast thou to do with the way of Assyria, that thou drinkest the waters of the river?

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 444 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>444. "Solve quatuor Angeles vinctos ad flumen magnum Euphratem," significat ut vincula externa auferantur illis, ut appareant interiora mentis illorum. - Quod haec per illa verba significentur, nemo potest scire, et vix suspicari, nisi sciat quid per "flumen magnum Euphratem," et quid per "quatuor Angelos ibi vinctos," intelligitur; per "Euphratem" in Verbo significantur interiora mentis hominis, quae vocantur rationalia, quae apud illos qui in veris ex bono sunt, plena sapientia sunt, at apud illos qui in falsis ex malo, plena insania sunt. Haec per "Euphratem fluvium" in Verbo significantur; causa est, quia fluvius ille terminabat Terram Canaanem ab Assyria, et per "Terram Canaanem" significabatur Ecclesia, et per "Assyriam" rationale ejus; et inde per flumen terminans, significantur interiora mentis quae vocantur rationalia in utroque sensu; sunt enim tria quae faciunt hominem Ecclesiae, spirituale, rationale seu intellectuale, ac naturale, quod etiam est scientificum. Spirituale Ecclesiae significabatur per "Terram Canaanem" ac per fluvios in illa; rationale seu Intellectuale Ecclesiae, per 'Aschurem" seu "Assyriam" et per ejus "flumen Euphratem;" ac naturale Ecclesiae quod etiam est scientificum, per "Aegyptum" et ejus "flumen" Nilum; sed de his videantur plura infra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_444/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_503" target=_top>503</a>). Per "quatuor Angelos ad flumen Euphratem vinctos" significantur interiora illa apud homines Ecclesiae, quae "vincta" dicuntur quia non propalantur; sunt enim spiritus infernales qui per quatuor hos Angelos intelliguntur, quia de illis dicitur, quod "parati essent ad occidendum tertiam partem hominum," ut mox sequitur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_444/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_446" target=_top>446</a>); ac interiora hominum cum spiritibus, vel infernalibus vel caelestibus, unum faciunt, quoniam cohabitant; per "solvere illos" significatur auferre vincula externa ut appareant interiora mentis eorum: haec sunt quae per illa verba significantur. Quod per "Euphratem" significentur interiora mentis hominis contermina spiritualibus Ecclesiae ejus, constare potest ex locis in Verbo ubi, nominatur "Aschur" seu "Assyria;" "Euphrates" autem occurrit in opposito sensu, In quo significat interiora plena falsis et inde insaniis, in his locis: <p>"Ecce Dominus <sup>1</sup>ascendere facit super eos aquas Fluvii" (Euphratis) "validas et multas, Regem Aschuris: hic ibit per Jehudam, mundabit et transibit," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_444/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_8_7-8" target=_top>Esaias 8:7-8</a>);<p>"Quid tibi cum via Aegypti, ut bibas aquas Schichoris; et quid tibi cum via Assyriae, ut bibas aquas Fluvii," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_444/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_2_18" target=_top>Jeremias 2:18</a>);<p>"Devovebit Jehovah linguam maris Aegypti, et agitabit manum super Fluvium" Euphratem, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_444/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_11_15" target=_top>Esaias 11:15</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>"Sextus Angelus effudit phialam super Fluvium Euphratem, cujus exsiccata est aqua," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_444/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_16_12" target=_top>Apocalypsis 16:12</a>);<p>Mandatum est Prophetae ut poneret cingulum super lumbis, et illud postea in foramine petrae juxta Euphratem absconderet: et cum illud post breve tempus recepit, ecce erat corruptum, nec proderat ad quicquam, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_444/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_13_1-7" target=_top>Jeremias 13:1-7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_444/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_13_11" target=_top>11</a>);<p>Et quoque mandatum illi, ut postquam absolverit legere librum, projiceret illum in medium Euphratis, et diceret, "Sic submergetur Babel, et non resurget," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_444/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_51_63-64" target=_top>Jeremias 51:63-64</a>);<p>per haec repraesentabantur interiora status Ecclesiae apud filios Israelis.
