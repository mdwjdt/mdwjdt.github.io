<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第584节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>584.启13:6.“他开口亵渎神，亵渎祂的名”表他们的言论，这些言论都是反对主的神性本身和神性人，同时反对源于圣言、藉以敬拜主的教会一切事物的谣言。“他开口亵渎”表示言论，它们都假话。“口”表示教义、讲道和讨论（<a href="452.htm">452</a>节），因而“开口”表示说出它们；“亵渎”表示对圣言的歪曲，以及其它事物，如前所述（<a href="571.htm">571</a>，<a href="582.htm">582</a>节），在此表示谣言，因为接下来就是反对“神和祂的名”；“神”表示主的神性，这在启示录其它许多地方也一样；“祂的名”表示主藉以受敬拜的一切事物，也表示圣言，因为敬拜照着圣言进行的（<a href="81.htm">81</a>节）。耶和华的“名”，或神的“名”表示主的神性人，同时表示圣言，同样表示主藉以受敬拜的一切事物。这一点从以下经文进一步看出来：</p><p>耶稣说，父啊，愿你荣耀你的名；当时就有声音从天上来，说，我已经荣耀了我的名，还要再荣耀。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.28.htm">12:28</a>）</p><p>耶稣说，我已将你的名显明与世人，我已使他们认识你的名。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.6.htm">17:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.26.htm">26</a>）你们奉我的名无论求什么，我必成就，叫父因儿子得荣耀；你们若奉我的名求什么，我必成就。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.13.htm">14:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.14.htm">14</a>）</p><p>太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。凡接待祂的，就是信祂名的人，祂就赐他们权柄作神的儿女；道成了肉身。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）</p><p>耶稣说，不信祂的人，罪已经定了，因为祂不信神独生子的名。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.18.htm">3:18</a>）</p><p>十诫第二诫中不可亵渎的“耶和华神的名”，以及主祷文中当尊为圣的“父的名”没有别的意思。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 584</h4><p>584. <a href="3927/revelation_13_6.htm">13:6</a> Then it opened its mouth in blasphemies against God and His name. This symbolizes their assertions, which are scandalous, against the Divine itself and the Lord's Divine humanity, and at the same time against everything that the church has from the Word by which the Lord is worshiped.<p>Its opening its mouth in blasphemies symbolizes assertions which are falsehoods. A mouth symbolizes doctrine, preaching and discourse (no. <a href="452.htm">452</a>). Therefore to open the mouth means, symbolically, to utter those falsehoods. Blasphemies symbolize falsifications of the Word and more, as said in nos. <a href="571.htm">571</a>, <a href="582.htm">582</a> above, here scandalous assertions as well, because the phrase follows, "against God and His name." God symbolizes the Lord's Divinity, as is the case often elsewhere in the book of Revelation. And His name symbolizes everything by which the Lord is worshiped, including the Word, because worship is conducted in accordance with it (no. <a href="81.htm">81</a>).<p>That the name of Jehovah or of God symbolizes the Lord's Divine humanity and at the same time the Word, as well as everything by which He is worshiped, can become further seen from the following passages:<p>(Jesus said,) "Father, glorify Your name." Then a voice came from heaven, saying, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again." (<a href="3927/john_12_28.htm">John 12:28</a>)<p>(Jesus said,) "I have manifested Your name to... men... and I have made known to them Your name...." (<a href="3927/john_17_6.htm">John 17:6</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>)<p>Whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I will do it. (<a href="3927/john_14_13.htm">John 14:13-14</a>)<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... As many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name... And the Word became flesh... (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>)<p>(Jesus said,) ."..he who does not believe (in Him) is judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. (<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>)<p>In the second commandment of the Decalogue, the name of Jehovah God that is not to be profaned, and in the Lord's Prayer, the name of the Father that is to be hallowed, have precisely this meaning. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 584</h4><p>584. [verse 6] 'And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God and His Name' signifies their sayings, which are scandals against the Lord's Divine Itself and Divine Human, and at the same the against everything of the Church derived from the Word, by means of which the Lord is worshipped. 'He opened his mouth in blasphemies' signifies the sayings, which are false-speaking. By 'mouth' is signified doctrine, preaching, and discussion (<a href="452.htm">452</a>), consequently by 'to open the mouth' is signified to utter them; and 'blasphemies' signify falsifications of the Word, and more things, as above (<a href="571.htm">571</a>, <a href="582.htm">582</a>), here indeed scandals, because it follows on 'against God and His Name.' By 'God' is signified the Lord's Divine, as often elsewhere in the Apocalypse; and by 'His Name' is signified everything by means of which He is worshipped, also the Word because worship is in accordance therewith (<a href="81.htm">81</a>). That by 'the Name' of Jehovah or of God is signified the Lord's Divine Human and at the same the time Word, also everything by means of which He is worshipped, can be further established from these passages:<p>Jesus said, Father glorify Thy Name, and there came a voice out of heaven saying, I have both glorified it and will glorify it again. <a href="3927/john_12_28.htm">John 12:28</a>.<p>Jesus said, I have made Thy Name manifest to men, and I have made Thy Name known to them. <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">John 17:26</a>.<p>Whatsoever you ask in My Name, this will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son; if you ask anything in My Name, I will do it. <a href="3927/john_14_13.htm">John 14:13-14</a>.<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; as many as have received, He has given them the power to be sons of God, believing in His Name; and the Word was made flesh. <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>Jesus said, He who does not believe in Him has been judged already, because he has not believed in the Name of the Only-begotten Son of God. <a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>.<p>By 'the Name of Jehovah God that is not to be profaned' in the second precept of the Decalogue, and by 'the Name of the Father that is to be hallowed' in the Lord's Prayer, nothing else is understood. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 584</h4><p>584. Verse 6. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, and His name, signifies their sayings, which are scandals, against the Divine Itself and the Divine Human of the Lord, and at the same time against everything of the church from the Word, by which the Lord is worshiped. "He opened his mouth in blasphemy," signifies the things uttered, which are false; by "a mouth" is signified doctrine, preaching, and discourse, (<a href="452.htm">452</a>), thus by "opening the mouth," is signified to utter them; and "blasphemies" signify falsifications of the Word, and other things, as above, (<a href="571.htm">571</a>, <a href="582.htm">582</a>), and in the present case, scandals, because it follows, against God and His name; by "God" is signified the Lord's Divine, as also in many other parts of Revelation; and by "his name" is signified everything by which the Lord is worshiped, likewise the Word, because worship is according to it, (<a href="81.htm">81</a>[1-4]) that by "the name" of Jehovah, or of God, is signified the Lord's Divine Human, and at the same time the Word, likewise everything by which He is worshiped, may further appear from the following passages:<p>Jesus said, Father, glorify Thy name; then came a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again, (<a href="3927/john_12_28.htm">John 12:28</a>).<p>Jesus said, I have manifested Thy name to men, and I have made known to them Thy name, (<a href="3927/john_17_6.htm">John 17:6</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>).<p>Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son; if ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it, (<a href="3927/john_14_13.htm">John 14:13-14</a>).<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. But as many as received, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name; and the Word was made flesh, (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>).<p>Jesus said, He that believeth not in Him is condemned already, because He hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God, (<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>).<p>By "the name of Jehovah God," which is not to be profaned, in the second commandment of the Decalogue; and by "the name of the Father," which is to be hallowed, in the Lord's prayer, nothing else is meant. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 584 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>584. (Vers. 6.) "Et aperuit os suum in blasphemias adversus Deum et Nomen Ipsius," significat effata illorum, quae sunt scandala, contra Ipsum in Divinum et Divinum Humanum Domini, et simul contra omne Ecclesiae ex Verbo, per quod Dominus colitur. - "Aperuit os suum in blasphemias" significat effata quae falsiloquia; per os significatur doctrina, praedicatio, et sermo (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_584/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_452" target=_top>452</a>); <sup>1</sup>inde per "aperire os" significatur effari illa; et "blasphemiae" significant falsificationes Verbi, et plura, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_584/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_571" target=_top>571</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_584/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_582" target=_top>582</a>), hic etiam scandala, quia sequitur, "adversus Deum et Nomen Ipsius;" per "Deum" significatur Divinum Domini, ut saepius alibi in Apocalypsi; et per "Nomen Ipsius" significatur omne per quod Dominus colitur, tum Verbum, quia secundum illud est cultus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_584/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_81" target=_top>81</a>). Quod per "Nomen" Jehovae seu Dei significetur Divinum Humanum Domini, et simul Verbum, tum omne per quod colitur, ulterius constare potest ex his locis: <p>Jesus dixit, "Pater glorifica Nomen Tuum; et venit vox e Caelo, dicens, Et glorificavi et rursus glorificabo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_584/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_28" target=_top>Johannes 12:28</a>);<p>Jesus dixit, "Manifestavi Tuum Nomen hominibus, et notum feci illis Nomen Tuum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_584/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_16_1-33" target=_top>Johannes 16</a>:(<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_584/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_16_6" target=_top>6</a>,) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_584/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_16_26" target=_top>26</a>);<p>"Quodcunque petieritis in Nomine Meo, hoc faciam, ut Pater glorificetur in Filio; si quid petieritis in Nomine Meo, Ego faciam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_584/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_13-14" target=_top>Johannes 14:13-14</a>);<p>"In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum; quotquot receperunt, dedit illis potestatem ut filii De essent, credentibus in Nomen Ipsius; et Verbum Caro factum est," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_584/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_1" target=_top>Johannes 1:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_584/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_12" target=_top>12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_584/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_14" target=_top>14</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>Jesus dixit, "Qui non credit in Ipsum, jam judicatus est, quia non credidit in Nomen Unigeniti Filii Dei," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_584/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_3_18" target=_top>Johannes 3:18</a>).<p>Per "Nomen Jehovae Dei" quod non prophanabitur, in secundo praecepto Decalogi, et per "Nomen Patris" quod sanctificabitur, in Oratione Dominica, non aliud intelligitur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;452 pro "453"<p>2.&nbsp;12 pro "11" </p>
