<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第516节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>516.“因地震而被杀的人有七千名”表在这种状态下，所有那些承认唯信，因而视仁爱行为毫无价值的人都灭亡了。和前面一样，“被杀”表示属灵的被杀，就是灵魂的灭亡；“地震”表示他们当中的状态变化，以及他们的毁灭，如前所述；“人有七千名”表示所有承认唯信，并因此视仁爱行为毫无价值，进而诅咒新教会的这两大神圣要素的人；“名”表示那些已然如此的人，因为“名字”表示人的性质（<a href="81.htm">81</a>，<a href="122.htm">122</a>，<a href="165.htm">165</a>节）；“七千”表示所有已然如此的人，因为“七千”与“七”所表相同，正如“一万二千”与“十二”所表相同（<a href="348.htm">348</a>节）。“七”表示所有人，所有事物，并论及天堂和教会的神圣事物，在反面意义上论及遭到亵渎的事物（参看<a href="10.htm">10</a>，<a href="271.htm">271</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 516</h4><p>516. And in the earthquake seven thousand people by name were killed. This symbolically means that in that state, all those people who professed faith alone and for that reason made works of charity of no account, perished.<p>To be killed symbolically means, here as before, to be killed spiritually, which is to perish in soul. The earthquake symbolizes the change of state in these people and their destruction, as said just above. Seven thousand people by name means, symbolically, all who have been proponents of faith alone, who consequently have made works of charity of no account, and who therefore have condemned the sacred two essential elements of the New Church. "By name" means, symbolically, people of this character, as a name symbolizes a person's character (nos. <a href="81.htm">81</a>, <a href="122.htm">122</a>, <a href="165.htm">165</a>), and seven thousand symbolizes all who are of this character. For seven thousand has the same symbolic meaning as seven, just as twelve thousand has the same symbolic meaning as twelve (no. <a href="348.htm">348</a>). That seven symbolizes all people or all things and is predicated of the holy things of heaven and the church, and in an opposite sense of things profane, may be seen in nos. <a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="271.htm">271</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 516</h4><p>516. 'And there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand names of men' signifies that in that state all those who confessed faith alone, and therefore made the works of charity of no account, perished. By 'to be killed' is signified, here as before, to be killed spiritually, which is to perish as to the soul. By 'the earthquake' is signified a change of state with those, and destruction, as just above. By 'seven thousand names of men' is signified all who have confessed faith alone, and therefore have made the works of charity of no account and for that reason have damned these two holy Essentials of the New Church. By 'names' are signified those who are such, for the 'name' signifies the quality of the man (<a href="81.htm">81</a>, <a href="122.htm">122</a>, <a href="165.htm">165</a>), and by 'seven thousand' are signified all who are such, for the same is signified by 'seven thousand' as by 'seven,' just as by 'twelve thousand' the same as by 'twelve' (<a href="348.htm">348</a>). That seven' signify all and all things, and are predicated of the holy things of heaven and the Church and in the opposite sense of those things profaned, may be seen (<a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="391.htm">391</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 516</h4><p>516. And in the earthquake were killed the names of men seven thousand, signifies that in that state all they who were in the confession of faith alone, and therefore made no account of works of charity, perished. By "being killed" is signified here, as before, to be killed spiritually, which is to perish as to the soul; by an "earthquake" is signified a change of state among them, and their destruction, as above; by "names of men seven thousand" are signified all who were in the confession of faith alone, and for that reason made no account of the works of charity, and therefore condemned those two holy essentials of the New Church; by "names" are signified they who are such, for "a name" signifies the quality of a man, (<a href="81.htm">81</a>, <a href="122.htm">122</a>, <a href="165.htm">165</a>); and by "seven thousand" are signified all who were such, for the same is signified by "seven thousand" as by "seven," just as by "twelve thousand" is signified the same as by "twelve" (<a href="348.htm">348</a>). That "seven" signifies all, and all things and is predicated of the holy things of heaven and the church, and, in the opposite sense, of the same when profaned may be seen, (<a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="391.htm">391</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 516 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>516. "Et occisa sunt in terrae motu nomina hominum millia septem," significat quod in illo statu omnes illi qui confessi sunt solam fidem, et propterea nihili fecerunt opera charitatis, perierint. Per "occidi" significatur hic ut prius, spiritualiter occidi, quod est quoad animam perire; per "terrae motum" significatur mutatio status apud illos, ac interitus, ut mox supra; per "nomina hominum millia septem" significantur omnes qui confessi sunt solam fidem, et propterea nihili fecerunt opera charitatis, et idcirco damnaverunt duo sancta illa Essentialia Ecclesiae Novae; per "nomina" significantur qui tales sunt, "nomen" enim significat quale hominis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_516/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_81" target=_top>81</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_516/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_122" target=_top>122</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_516/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_165" target=_top>165</a>) <sup>1</sup>et per "millia septem" significantur omnes qui tales, idem enim per "septem millia" quod per "septem" significatur, sicut per "duodecim millia" idem quod per duodecim," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_516/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_11" target=_top>11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_516/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348" target=_top>348</a>). Quod "septem" significent omnes et omnia, ac praedicentur de sanctis Caeli et Ecclesiae, et in opposito sensu de illis prophanatis, videatur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_516/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_10" target=_top>10</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_516/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_391" target=_top>391</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;81 pro "31" </p>
