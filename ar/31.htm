<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第31节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>31.“全能者”表那存在、活着，凭自己拥有权能，并藉着终从初管理一切事物的。既然万物皆来自产，从来自祂的最初被造，并且没有一样东西不是由此存在，如《圣爱与圣智》一书所充分说明的，那么可知，祂必是那全能者。可以设想一下万物所出的那一位；那一位的万物，就是按一定次序依赖那一位的万物，岂不像环环相扣的各个环节，或如依赖心脏的全身血管，或如依赖太阳的整个宇宙中的一切和每一个事物？万物就是这样依赖于主，祂是灵界的太阳，一切本质、生命、能力皆来自祂。一言以蔽之，“我们生活，动作，存留，都在乎祂”（使徒行传<a href="http://39-27.cn/徒17.28.htm">17:28</a>）。这就是神性全能。主通过终从初统管万有，这是以前从未揭示的奥秘，如今在《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》和《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》中的许多地方，以及《圣治》（<a href="../dp/124.htm">124</a>节）、《圣爱与圣智》（<a href="../dlw/221.htm">221</a>节）已有解释。众所周知，神性因是无限的，故不会落入任何世人和天使的思想观念，因为他们是有限的，有限者不能参透无限者。但是，为了能在某种程度上有所领悟，主乐意用这些话描述祂的无限：我是阿拉法，是俄梅戛，是始，是终；是昔在，今在，以后永在的全能者。因此，这些话包含了天使和世人对于神所能思想的一切，无论以属灵的方式还是以属世的方式。总体来说，这些事就是上面以普遍方式所引用的内容。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 31</h4><p>31. "The Almighty." This symbolically means, who exists, lives, and has power of Himself, and who directs all things from the first of them through the last.<p>Since all things originate from the Lord, created from their first elements that emanate from Him, and since nothing exists that does not spring from that origin, as we showed many times in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom, it follows that He is the Almighty or omnipotent.<p>Postulate a single entity from which all others spring. Are they not all connected with that single entity, on which they depend one after another, like the links of a chain on the one at the head? Or like the blood vessels throughout the body on the heart? Or like every single constituent of the whole of creation on the sun - thus on the Lord, who is the sun of the spiritual world, from whom springs all the essence, life and power which exist among those who are under that sun? In short, from Him we have our being, live, and move (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_17_28.htm">Acts of the Apostles 17:28</a>). That is Divine omnipotence.<p>That the Lord directs all things from the first of them through the last is an arcanum not previously revealed, but which has been explained in many places in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord and Regarding the Sacred Scripture, and also in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Providence <a href="../dp/124.htm">124</a>, and Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom <a href="../dlw/221.htm">221</a>.<p>People know that the Divine, being infinite, does not fall within the scope of anyone's mental conceptions, nor those of any angel, because those conceptions are finite, and a finite person is incapable of perceiving infinity. Nevertheless, in order that it may be perceived in some way, it has pleased the Lord to describe His infinity with these words, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty. Consequently these words include everything that an angel or person could ever conceive of, spiritually and naturally, regarding the Divine, concepts which in general are those universally that we have cited above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 31</h4><p>31. 'And the Almighty' signifies Who is, lives, and has power out of His Very Self, and Who rules all things out of primes by means of ultimates. Since all things are out of the Lord, created out of the Primes that are from Him, and there is nothing that does not come into existence as a result of this, as has been shown in many [passages] in ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM, it follows that He is 'the Almighty.' Suppose there to be a One out of which all things are. Are not all things of that One, on which they depend in an order, as the links of a chain on the one at the head, or as the blood-vessels of the whole body on the heart, or as all things and each of the things of the universe on the sun? Thus [are all things] from the Lord, Who is the Sun of the spiritual world, from Whom is all the essence, life, and power which those who are under that Sun have. In a word, from Him we are, we live, and we move (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_17_28.htm">Acts of the Apostles 17:28</a>). This is the Divine Omnipotence. That the Lord rules all things from primes by means of ultimates is an arcanum not revealed up to this time, but it has been expounded in many places in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD, and CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE, also in <a href="../dp/124.htm">ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE PROVIDENCE 124</a>; and <a href="../dlw/221.htm">CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM 221</a>. It is known that the Divine, because it is the Infinite, does not fall into the ideas of the thought of any man or angel, because they are finite, and the finite is not capable of perceiving the Infinite; nevertheless, in order that it may in some manner be perceived, it has pleased the Lord to describe His Infinity by these words, 'I AM ALPHA AND OMEGA, THE BEGINNING AND THE ENDING, WHO IS AND WHO WAS AND WHO IS TO COME, THE ALMIGHTY.' These words therefore include all the things that any angel or man can think spiritually or naturally concerning the Divine; which things are in general those that have been adduced above in a universal way. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 31</h4><p>31. The Almighty, signifies who is, lives, and has power from Himself, and who rules all things from firsts by ultimates. Since all things are from the Lord, and are created from the firsts which are from Him; and nothing is given which does not exist therefrom, as is abundantly shown in the Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom, it follows, that He is omnipotent. Suppose One from whom are all things; are not all things of that One, upon whom they depend in order, like the links of a chain upon their hook; or like the blood vessels of the whole body upon the heart; or as each and everything in the universe on the sun? Thus do all things depend on the Lord, who is the sun of the spiritual world, from whom is all the essence, life, and power, with those who are under that sun. In a word, "from Him we live, and move, and have our being" (<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_17_28.htm">Acts of the Apostles 17:28</a>). This is the Divine omnipotence. That the Lord rules all things from firsts by ultimates, is an arcanum never before revealed; but it is now explained in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord and Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture in many places; and also in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Providence, (<a href="124.htm">124</a>); and Divine Love and Wisdom, (<a href="221.htm">221</a>). It is known that the Divine because it is infinite, does not fall into the ideas of the thought of any man nor of any angel, because they are finite, and the finite does not have the capacity of perceiving the infinite; still, that it may in some manner be perceived, it has pleased the Lord to describe His infinity by these words:<p>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End; Who is, and Who was, and Who is to come, the Almighty.<p>These words, therefore, include all things which angel and man can ever think, spiritually and naturally, concerning the Divine; which things, in general, are what were adduced above universally. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 31 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>31. Et Omnipotens," significat Qui est, vivit et potest ex Se Ipso, et Qui regit omnia ex primis per ultima. -Quoniam omnia sunt ex Domino, creata ex Primis quae ab Ipso sunt, et nihil datur quod inde non existit, ut multis ostensum est in Sapientia Angelica de Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia, sequitur quod sit Omnipotens: pone Unum ex quo omnia sunt, annon omnia sunt Unius, a quo pendent in ordine, sicut unci catenae a Capitello, aut sicut vasa sanguinea totius corporis a Corde, aut sicut Universi omnia et singula a Sole; ita a Domino, Qui est Sol Mundi Spiritualis, a Quo est omnis Essentia, Vita et Potentia, quae apud illos qui sub Sole illo sunt; verbo, <p>Ab Ipso sumus, vivimus et movemur," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_31/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_acts-of-the-apostles_17_28" target=_top>Acta Apostolorum 17:28</a>);<p>hoc Divina Omnipotentia est. Quod Dominus regat omnia a Primis per Ultima, est Arcanum hactenus non revelatum, at explicatum in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino, et de Scriptura Sacra, multis in locis; tum in Sapientia Angelica de <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_31/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_124" target=_top>Divina Providentia 124</a>; et de Divino Amore (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_31/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_221" target=_top>221</a>). Notum est, quod Divinum, quia est Infinitum, non cadat in ideas cogitationis alicujus hominis nec angeli, quia sunt finitae, et finitus non est capax percipiendi Infinitum; ut tamen aliquo modo percipiatur, placuit Domino Infinitatem Suam describere per haec, <p>"Ego sum Alpha et Omega, Principium et Finis; Qui Est et Qui Fuit et Qui Venturus, Omnipotens;" <p>quare haec verba includunt omnia, quae usquam angelus et homo de Divino spiritualiter et naturaliter cogitare potest; quae in genere sunt illa, quae supra universaliter adducta sunt. </p>
