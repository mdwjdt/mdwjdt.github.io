<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第115节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>115.“同样，连你也有执守我所恨恶的尼哥拉派教义的人”表他们当中有些人所行的是为了邀功。“尼哥拉派的行为”是指邀功的行为（参看<a href="86.htm">86</a>节）。“别迦摩教会”是指那些将教会的一切放在善行，丝毫不放在教义真理上的人。在这些人当中，有些人所行的，既有虚伪的行为，也有邀功的行为，但并不是所有人都这样，故经上说“你有执守巴兰教义的人在你那里”；还说“连你也有执守我所恨恶的尼哥拉派教义的人”；敬拜的行为要么是良善的，要么是邀功的，要么是虚伪的。此处论述后两种行为，之后下文则论述善行。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 115</h4><p>115. "'Thus you have also those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.'" (<a href="3927/revelation_2_15.htm">2:15</a>) This symbolically means that they have among them also people who make works deserving of merit.<p>That the works of the Nicolaitans are merit-seeking works may be seen in no. <a href="86.htm">86</a> above.<p>Among people who place everything having to do with the church and salvation in good works, and not anything in doctrinal truths - those meant by the church in Pergamum - there are some who perform hypocritical works, and some merit-seeking works, but still not all. So we are told that "you have there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam," and, "you have also those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans." Moreover, all works connected with worship are either good, or merit-seeking, or hypocritical. Therefore the latter two are spoken of here, and afterward good works in the next verse. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 115</h4><p>115. [verse 15] 'So thou hast, even thou, those holding the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate' signifies that among them there are also those who do works for the sake of recompense. That the works 'of the Nicolaitans' are works for the sake of recompense may be seen above (<a href="86.htm">86</a>). In the case of those who place everything of the Church and of salvation in good works and not anything in the truths of doctrine, who are those who are understood by 'the Church in Pergamum,' there are some who do hypocritical works, also works for the sake of recompense, but yet not all. It is therefore said that 'thou hast there those holding the doctrine [of] Balaam,' also 'thou hast, even thou, those holding the doctrine of the Nicolaitans'; and all works of worship are either good, or for the sake of recompense, or hypocritical; therefore [something] is said here concerning the latter two and, after those, concerning good works in the things following. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 115</h4><p>115. Verse 15. So thou hast, even thou, them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which I hate, signifies that there are some among them also who make works meritorious. That the "works of the Nicolaitans" are meritorious works, may be seen above, (<a href="86.htm">86</a>). Among those who place the all of the church and of salvation in good works, and not anything in truths of doctrine, who are those who are meant by "the church in Pergamos," there are some who do hypocritical works and also meritorious works, but still not all; therefore it is said, "Thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam;" as also, "So thou hast, even thou, them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans;" and all works of worship are either good, or meritorious, or hypocritical, therefore the two latter are here spoken of, and good works afterwards in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 115 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>115. (Vers. 25.) "Ita habes et tu tenentes doctrinam Nicolaitarum, quod odi," significat quod inter illos etiam sint qui faciunt opera meritoria. - Quod "opera Nicolaitarum" sint opera meritoria, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_115/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_86" target=_top>86</a>). Apud illos qui omne Ecclesiae et salutis ponunt in bonis operibus, et non aliquid in veris doctrinae, qui sunt qui per "Ecclesiam in Pergamo" intelliguntur, dantur qui faciunt opera hypocritica, tum opera meritoria, sed usque non omnes; quare dicitur, quod "habeas ibi tenentes doctrinam Balaam," tum, "habes et tu tenentes doctrinam Nicolaitarum;" et omnia opera cultus sunt vel bona, vel meritoria, vel hypocritica; quare de his duobus hic dicitur, et de operibus bonis post illa in sequentibus. </p>
