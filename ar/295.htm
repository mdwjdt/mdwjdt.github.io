<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 295</h4><p>295. CHAPTER 6<p>1. Now I saw when the Lamb opened the first of the seals; and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as though with a voice of thunder, "Come and see."<p>2. And I looked, and behold, a white horse. And he who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.<p>3. When He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, "Come and see."<p>4. And another horse, fiery red, went out. And it was granted to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth, so that people might kill one another; and there was given to him a great sword.<p>5. When He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Come and see." So I looked, and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a scale in his hand.<p>6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, "A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine."<p>7. When He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, "Come and see."<p>8. So I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with famine, with death, and by the beasts of the earth.<p>9. When He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held.<p>10. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, who are holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"<p>11. Then white robes were given to each of them; and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until the number of both their fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they were, was complete.<p>12. Then I looked when He opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became as black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood.<p>13. And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind.<p>14. Then the sky departed like a book rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place.<p>15. And the kings of the earth and the great men, the rich men and the commanders, and the powerful, and every slave and every freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains,<p>16. and they said to the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!<p>17. For the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?"<p>THE SPIRITUAL MEANING<p>The Contents of the Whole Chapter<p>This describes the examination of those people on whom the Last Judgment would fall, and they were examined to see what understanding of the Word they had among them, and so what their state of life was. Some were found to possess truths springing from goodness (verses 1, 2); some to be without any goodness (verses 3, 4); some to have a contempt for the truth (verses 5, 6); and some to be utterly devastated and purged as regards both goodness and truth (verses 7, 8).<p>Described, too, is the state of people who, because of the evil, were protected by the Lord in a lower earth, who would be set free at the time of the Last Judgment (verses 9-11).<p>Also the state of people who were caught up in evils and so in falsities - what it would be like on the day of the Last Judgment (verses 12-17).<p>The Contents of the Individual Verses:<p></p><table><thead><tr><th>Verse Contents</th><th>Spiritual Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.

So I looked, and behold, a pale horse.</td><td>An understanding of the Word extinguished as to both goodness and truth.</td></tr><tr><td>And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hell followed with him.</td><td>The extinction of spiritual life and thus damnation.</td></tr><tr><td>And power was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill</td><td>The destruction of all good in the church</td></tr><tr><td>with sword, with famine, with death, and by the beasts of the earth.</td><td>by doctrinal falsities, by evil practices, by self-love, and by lusts.</td></tr><tr><td>9. When He opened the fifth seal,</td><td>An examination by the Lord of the states of life of people who would be saved on the day of the Last Judgment, and who in the meantime were sequestered.</td></tr><tr><td>I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held.</td><td>People who, having been expelled by the evil because of their life in accordance with the Word's truths and their acknowledgment of the Lord's Divine humanity, were protected by the Lord to keep them from being led astray.</td></tr><tr><td>10.

Then white robes were given to each of them;</td><td>A communication and conjunction of them with angels possessing Divine truths,</td></tr><tr><td>and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until the number of both their fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they were, was complete.</td><td>that the Last Judgment would be delayed a little while longer, until those people should be gathered together who likewise were expelled by the evil.</td></tr><tr><td>12. Then I looked when He opened the sixth seal,</td><td>An examination by the Lord of the states of life of people who were inwardly evil, on whom the Last Judgment would fall.</td></tr><tr><td>and behold, there was a great earthquake;</td><td>The state of the church among them completely changed, and their terror.</td></tr><tr><td>and the sun became as black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood.</td><td>All goodness of love was adulterated in them, and every truth of faith falsified.</td></tr><tr><td>13. And the stars of heaven fell to the earth,</td><td>All concepts of goodness and truth were dispelled</td></tr><tr><td>as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind.</td><td>by reasonings of the natural self divorced from the spiritual self.</td></tr><tr><td>14. Then the sky departed like a book rolled up,</td><td>The people's separation from heaven and conjunction with hell.</td></tr><tr><td>and every mountain and island was moved out of its place.</td><td>All goodness of love and truth of faith vanished.</td></tr><tr><td>15. And the kings of the earth and the great men, the rich men and the commanders, and the powerful, and every slave and every freeman,</td><td>Those who before the separation had possessed an understanding of truth and good, a knowledge of their concepts, and learning, acquired from others or on their own, and yet who lacked a life in accordance with them,</td></tr><tr><td>hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains,</td><td>were now caught up in evils and in the falsities accompanying evil.</td></tr><tr><td>16. and they said to the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!</td><td>Affirmations of evil by falsities springing from evil, until they did not acknowledge anything of the Lord's Divinity.</td></tr><tr><td>17. For the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?"</td><td>They became of such a character of themselves as a result of their separation from good and faithful people, because of the Last Judgment, which they could not otherwise endure.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>THE EXPOSITION<p>Now I saw when the Lamb opened the first of the seals. (<a href="3927/revelation_6_1.htm">6:1</a>) This symbolizes an examination by the Lord of all those people on whom the Last Judgment would fall, as to their understanding of the Word and thus their states of life.<p>This is the symbolic meaning because there follows next in order an examination of all the people on whom the Last Judgment would fall as to their states of life, and this by the Lord in accordance with the Word. Consequently this is what is symbolically meant by the Lamb's opening the seals of the book.<p>To be shown that to open the book and loose its seals means, symbolically, to know the states of life of all people and to judge each one according to his state, see nos. <a href="259.htm">259</a>, <a href="265.htm">265-267</a>, <a href="273.htm">273</a>, <a href="274.htm">274</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 295</h4><p>295. THE SIXTH CHAPTER<p>1. And I saw when the Lamb had opened the first of the seals, and I heard one of the four animals saying as with a voice of thunder, Come and look.<p>2. And I saw, and behold a white horse, and the one sitting upon it having a bow, and a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.<p>3. And when He had opened the second seal, I heard the second animal saying, Come and look.<p>4. And there went forth another horse, red, and it was given to the one sitting upon it to take away peace from the land, so that they should slay one another, and there was given unto him a great sword (machaera).<p>5. And when He had opened the third seal, I heard the third animal saying, Come and look. And I saw, and behold a black horse, and the one Sitting upon it having a balance in his hand.<p>6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four animals saying, A measure (chaenix) of wheat for a penny (denarius), and three measures of barley for a penny, and do not hurt the oil and the wine.<p>7. And when He had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth animal saying, Come and look.<p>8. And I saw, and behold a pale horse, and the one sitting upon it, whose name was death, and hell was following with him, and there was given unto them the power of putting to death over a fourth part of the land, with the sword (romphaea), with famine, with death, and by the beasts [of the land].<p>9. And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those slain for the Word of God, and for the testimony that they held.<p>10. And they were crying out with a great voice, saying, How long, O Lord, Who art Holy and True, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on those dwelling upon the land?<p>11. And white robes were given to each one; and it was said unto them that they should rest yet a little while, until both their fellow-servants and their brothers, who were going to be slain as they had been, are made up to the full extent.<p>12. And I saw when He had opened the sixth seal, and behold a great earthquake was brought about, and the sun became black as a hairy sack, and the moon became as blood.<p>13. And the stars of heaven fell to earth, as a fig-tree shaken by a great wind casts its unripe figs.<p>14. And the heaven departed as a book rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.<p>15. And the kings of the land and the great men, and the rich men and the rulers of thousands, and the mighty men, and every bondman and every freeman hid themselves away in the caves, and in the rocks of the mountains.<p>16. And they were saying to the mountains and the rocks, Fall upon us, and hide us away from the face of the One sitting upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.<p>17. Because the great day of His wrath is coming, and who is able to stand?<p>THE SPIRITUAL SENSE<p>THE CONTENTS OF THE WHOLE CHAPTER<p>It treats of the examination of those upon whom there is going to be the last judgment; and an examination as to what kind of an understanding of the Word there had been with them, and from this what the state of their life was.<p>That there were those who were in truths derived from good (verses 1-2); those who were without good (verses 3-4); those who were in contempt of truth (vers 5-6); and those who were altogether vastated as to good and as to truth (verses 7-8).<p>Of the state of those who, having been protected by the Lord in the lower land on account of the evil, were to be set free at the time of the last judgment (verses 9-11).<p>Of the state of those who were in evils and the untruths therefrom; what it is like at the day of the last judgment (verses 12-17).<p>THE CONTENTS OF EACH OF THE VERSES<p>1. And I saw when the Lamb had opened the first of the seals, signifies the examination by the Lord of all upon whom there is going to be the last judgment, as to the understanding of the Word, and from this as to the states of their life.<p>And I heard one of the four animals saying as with a voice of thunder, signifies in accordance with the Divine Truth of the Word.<p>Come and look, signifies the manifestation concerning those first in order.<p>2. And I saw and behold a white horse, signifies the understanding of truth and good out of the Word with these.<p>And the one sitting upon it having a bow, signifies that with these there is a doctrine of good and truth out of the Word, out of which they have fought against the untruths and evils that are from hell.<p>And a crown was given unto him, signifies their badge of combat.<p>And he went forth conquering and to conquer, signifies victory over evils and untruths for ever.<p>3. And when He had opened the second seal, and I heard the second animal saying, Come and look, signifies the same here as above.<p>4.

These things are signified because there now follows in order the examination of all upon whom there is going to be the last judgment, as to the state of their life, and this by the Lord in accordance with the Word.
