<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>389.“天上寂静约有二刻”表当主的属灵国度的众天使看到那些自称有信之人处于这样的状态时，他们都大吃一惊。“天上寂静”无非表示对那些自称有信，却处于这种状态之人的震惊；下文描述了他们的状态，从解读可以看出其状态的品质。“二刻”或 “半小时”表示大大地或非常，因为“一个小时”表示一个完整的状态。“时间”表示状态，这一点可参看下文。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 389</h4><p>389. There was silence in heaven for about half an hour. This symbolically means that angels from the Lord's spiritual kingdom were quite dumbfounded when they saw people who claimed to have faith to be in the state they were.<p>The silence in heaven means nothing else than an astonishment there over people who claim to have faith and yet are in such a state. For their state is described in the following verses, and their character can be seen from the explanations given.<p>Half an hour means, symbolically, much or quite, because an hour symbolizes a completed state.<p>That time symbolizes state is something that will be seen below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 389</h4><p>389. 'It became silent in heaven for what seemed half an hour' signifies that the angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom were exceedingly astonished when they saw those who had declared themselves to be in faith in such a state. By the silence in heaven nothing, else is understood but the astonishment there in regard to those who declare themselves to be in faith, and yet are in such a state; for their state is described in the things following, the quality of which can be established from the expositions. By 'half an hour' is signified exceedingly, because by 'an hour' is signified a full state. That time signifies state will be seen below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 389</h4><p>389. There was silence in heaven as of half an hour, signifies that the angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom were greatly amazed, when they saw those who said they were in faith, in such a state. By "silence in heaven," nothing else is meant but amazement there in regard to those who say they are in faith, and yet are in such a state; for their state is described in what follows, the quality of which can be seen from the explanation. By "half an hour" is signified greatly, because by "an hour" is signified a full state. That "time" signifies state, will be seen below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 389 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>389. "Factum est silentium in Caelo quasi semihoram," significat quod Angeli e Regno spirituali Domini valde obstupescerent, cum viderunt illos qui dixerunt se in fide esse in tali statu. - Per "silentium in Caelo" non aliud intelligitur quam obstupescentia ibi super illos qui se dicunt in fide esse, et tamen in tali statu; status enim illorum describitur in sequentibus, qui qualis est, ab explicatis constare potest: per "semihoram" significatur valde, quia per "horam" significatur status plenus. Quod "tempus" significet statum, videbitur infra. </p>
