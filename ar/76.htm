<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第76节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>76.“我知道你的行为”表祂立刻洞悉人所有的内层和外层。启示录经常提到“行为”（Works），只是很少有人知道行为是什么意思。众所周知，十个人可能会做出表面上一样的行为来，然而它们全都各不相同，因为它们是从不同的目的和动机发出的，目的和动机使得行为或善或恶。事实上，每一个行为都是心智的行为，故心智如何，行为就如何。心智若是仁，行为就变成仁；心智若不是仁，行为就不会变成仁；然而，它们外在看似相同。行为以外在形式向世人显现，以内在形式向天使显现；而它们的品质，则从最内在到最外在向主显现。外在形式上的行为看似果实的表皮，而内在形式上的行为则看似果实的内里，内里由无数可食用的部分组成，最中间是种子，种子里面也有无数事物，细微到连最敏锐的肉眼也不能分辨，甚至超出人的理解范畴。一切行为正是如此，其内在品质唯有主能洞悉，并且当人正在做出行为时，天使也是靠主来感知它们。关于这个主题，可参看《圣爱与圣智》（<a href="../dlw/209.htm">209</a>-220，<a href="../dlw/277.htm">277</a>-281节），也可参看下文（<a href="141.htm">141</a>，<a href="641.htm">641</a>，<a href="688.htm">688</a>节）。从这些事可以证实，“我知道你的行为”“我知道你的行为”表示主立刻洞悉人所有的内层和外层。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 76</h4><p>76. "'I know your works.'" (<a href="3927/revelation_2_2.htm">2:2</a>) This symbolically means that the Lord sees all a person's inner and outer qualities simultaneously.<p>Works are often mentioned in the book of Revelation, but few know what works mean. This much is known, that ten people may do works which outwardly appear alike, but which are nevertheless not alike within them all, because the works emanate from different ends and different causes, and it is the end and cause that make works to be either good or evil. For every work is a work of the mind. Consequently whatever the character of the mind, such is the character of the work. If the mind is an embodiment of charity, the work becomes an expression of charity. But if the mind is not an embodiment of charity, the work does not become an expression of charity. Yet the two may appear alike outwardly.<p>Works are visible in their outward form to people, but in their inward form to angels, and to the Lord they appear as they are from their inmost elements to their outmost ones.<p>Works in their outward form have an appearance not unlike that of unpeeled fruit, while works in their inward form have an appearance like that of the fruit inside the peel, where one finds countless edible parts, and at the center seeds containing once again countless constituents, which are far too small to be seen by the eyes, indeed which surpass the scope of the human intellect.<p>Such is the nature of all works, whose inward character the Lord alone sees, and which angels also perceive from the Lord when a person is doing them.<p>But more on this subject may be seen in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom, nos. <a href="../dlw/209.htm">209-220</a> and nos. <a href="../dlw/277.htm">277-281</a>; and also here below, nos. <a href="141.htm">141</a>, <a href="641.htm">641</a>, <a href="868.htm">868</a>.<p>It can be seen from this that the declaration, "I know your works," means, symbolically, that the Lord sees all a person's inner and outer qualities simultaneously. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 76</h4><p>76. [verse 2] 'I know thy works' signifies that He sees all the interiors and exteriors of a man at once. 'Works' are often mentioned in the Apocalypse, but few know what is understood by 'works.' This is known, that ten men can do works that appear alike in externals, but which are unlike even with all of them, because they come forth out of a different end and cause, and the end and cause make works to be either good or evil; for every work is a work of the mind, and consequently such as the mind is, such is the work. If the mind is charity, the work becomes charity; but if the mind is not charity, the work does not become charity; yet both can appear alike in externals. Works appear to men in an external, but to angels in an internal, form; while to the Lord they appear such as they are from inmosts to outmosts. Works in an external form appear not unlike fruits on the surface, but works in an internal form appear like fruits inside the surface, where there are countless edible parts, and in the midst seeds in which again are countless things that are quite beyond eyesight, being in fact above the intellectual sphere of a man. Such are all works, which, such as they are within, only the Lord sees, and which, when the man is doing them, the angels perceive from the Lord. But concerning these things more may be seen in <a href="../dlw/209.htm">ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM 209-220</a>, <a href="../dlw/277.htm">277-281</a>; and also below (<a href="141.htm">141</a>, <a href="641.htm">641</a>, <a href="868.htm">868</a>). From these things it can be established that by 'I know thy works' is signified that the Lord sees all the interiors and exteriors of a man at once. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 76</h4><p>76. Verse 2. I know thy works, signifies that He sees all the interiors and exteriors of man at once. "Works" are often mentioned in Revelation, but few know what is meant by works. This is known, that ten men can do works which externally appear alike, but which yet are dissimilar with them all; and this because they proceed from different ends and different causes, the end and the cause rendering the works either good or evil; for every work is a work of the mind, therefore, such as is the quality of the mind, such is the work. If the mind is charity, the work becomes charity; but if the mind is not charity, the work does not become charity; still, however, they may both appear alike in externals. Works appear to men in external form, but to angels in internal form; and to the Lord their quality is apparent from inmost to outmosts. Works in their external form appear like the outside of fruits, but works in their internal form appear like the inside of fruits, where there are innumerable edible parts, and in the midst seeds, in which there are also things innumerable, which are too minute for the keenest eye to discern, yea, which are above the intellectual sphere of man. Such are all works, the internal quality of which the Lord alone sees, and which the angels also perceive from the Lord, when man is doing them. But on this subject more may be seen in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom, (<a href="209.htm">209-220</a>, <a href="277.htm">277-281</a>; and also below, <a href="141.htm">141</a>, <a href="641.htm">641</a>, <a href="688.htm">688</a>). From these things it may appear, that by "I know thy works," is signified that the Lord sees all the interiors and exteriors of man at once. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 76 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>76. (Vers. 2.) "Novi opera tua," significat quod Ipse videat omnia interiora et exteriora hominis simul. - "Opera" saepius leguntur in Apocalypsi, sed quid per opera intelligitur, pauci sciunt; hoc notum est, quod decem homines possint facere opera quae in externis apparent similia, sed quae usque apud omnes dissimilia sunt, quia ex alio fine et ex alia causa procedunt, ac finis et causa faciunt quod opera vel bona vel mala sint; omne enim opus est mentis opus, inde qualis est mens tale est opus; si mens est charitas, fit opus charitas; si autem mens non est charitas, opus non fit charitas; utrumque usque potest simile apparere in externis. Opera apparent hominibus in externa forma, at vero angelis in interna, et Domino qualia sunt ab intimis ad extrema. Opera in externa forma non aliter apparent quam sicut fructus in superficie, at opera in interna forma apparent sicut fructus intra superficiem, ubi sunt innumerabiles partes edules, et in medio semina in quibus iterum sunt innumerabilia quae longe intra omnem oculorum aciem sunt, imo supra intellectualem hominis sphaeram: talia sunt omnia opera, quae qualia sunt intus, Solus Dominus videt, et quoque ex Domino percipiunt angeli, cum homo illa operatur. Sed de his videantur plura in Sapientia Angelica de Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_76/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_209" target=_top>209-220</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_76/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_277" target=_top>277-281</a>) et quoque infra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_76/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_141" target=_top>141</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_76/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_641" target=_top>641</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_76/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_868" target=_top>868</a>). Ex his constare potest, quod per "Novi opera tua" significetur quod Dominus videat omnia interiora et exteriora hominis simul. </p>
