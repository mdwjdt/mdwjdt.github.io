<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第167节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>167.“他们要穿白衣与我同行（因为他们是配得过的）”表他们将在主的属灵国度中与祂一起生活，因为他们处在祂的真理之中。这就是这些话的含义，因为在圣言中，“行”表生活，“与神同行”表靠祂生活；“穿白衣”表处于真理。在圣言中，“白”论及真理，因为它源于太阳之光；“红”论及良善，因为它源于太阳之火；“黑”论及虚假，因为它源于地狱的黑暗。处于主的真理之人因与主结合，故被称为“配得过的”，因为在灵界，所有的配得都来自与主的结合。从这些事明显可知，“他们要穿白衣与我同行，因为他们是配得过的”就表示他们将与主一起生活，因为他们处于主的真理。之所以说他们将在主的属灵国度中与主一起生活，是因为整个天堂分为两个国度，即属天国度和属灵国度，处于主的爱之良善的人住在属天国度，处于主的智慧之真理的人住在属灵国度；经上称后者“穿白衣与主同行”；他们也的确身穿白衣。</p><p>“行”表示生活，“与神同行”表示因靠着祂而与祂一起生活。这一点从以下经文可得以证实：</p><p>祂以平安和正直与我同行。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛2.6.htm">2:6</a>）</p><p>你岂不是救护我的脚不跌倒，使我在生命光中行在神面前吗？（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗56.13.htm">56:13</a>）</p><p>大卫遵守我的诫命，全心跟从（walked after）我。（列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上14.8.htm">14:8</a>）</p><p>耶和华啊，求你记念我在你面前按真理而行。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛38.3.htm">38:3</a>）</p><p>倘若你们与我背道而行，不听从我，我也要与你们背道而行。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.23.htm">26:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.24.htm">24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.27.htm">27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.28.htm">28</a>）</p><p>他们不肯遵行耶和华的道。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.24.htm">42:24</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.22.htm">11:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申19.9.htm">19:9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申26.17.htm">26:17</a>）</p><p>万民各奉己神的名而行，我们却奉耶和华的名而行。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥4.5.htm">4:5</a>）</p><p>光在你们中间还有不多的时候，应当趁着有光行走，信从这光。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.35.htm">12:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.36.htm">36</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.12.htm">8:12</a>）</p><p>文士问，门徒为什么不照古人的传统而行呢？（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可7.5.htm">7:5</a>）</p><p>“行”也论及耶和华，如“在他们中间行走”，也就是在他们当中并与他们一起生活。</p><p>我要在他们中间立我的居所，在你们中间行走，作你们的神。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.11.htm">26:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>从这些经文明显可知下面这句话是什么意思：</p><p>这些事是那右手拿着七星，在七个金灯台中间行走的说的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.1.htm">2:1</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 167</h4><p>167. "'And they shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.'" This symbolically means that they will live with the Lord in His spiritual kingdom, because they are governed by truths from Him.<p>This is the meaning of these words because to walk in the Word symbolically means to live, and to walk with God symbolically means to live from Him, and because to be in white means, symbolically, to be guided by truths. For the color white in the Word is predicated of truths, because it takes its origin from the light of the sun, while red is predicated of goods, because it takes its origin from the sun's fire, and blackness is predicated of falsities, because it takes its origin from the darkness of hell.<p>People who are governed by truths from the Lord, being conjoined with Him, are called worthy, for all worth in the spiritual world comes from conjunction with the Lord.<p>It is apparent from this that "they shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy," means, symbolically, that they will live with the Lord, because they are governed by truths from Him.<p>We say that they will live with the Lord in His spiritual kingdom because the whole of heaven has been distinguished into two kingdoms - the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom - and in the celestial kingdom live people who are governed by the goodness of love from the Lord, while in the spiritual kingdom live those who are governed by the truths of wisdom from the Lord. The latter are also said to walk with the Lord in white. Moreover, they are dressed in white garments.</p><p>[2] That to walk means, symbolically, to live, and to walk with God means to live with Him because it is to live from Him, is clear from the following passages:<p>He walked with Me in peace and rectitude... (<a href="3927/malachi_2_6.htm">Malachi 2:6</a>)<p>You have delivered my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living. (<a href="3927/psalms_56_13.htm">Psalms 56:13</a>)<p>...David... kept My commandments and... walked after Me with all his heart... (<a href="3927/1-kings_14_8.htm">1 Kings 14:8</a>)<p>Remember..., O Jehovah..., how I have walked before You in truth... (<a href="3927/isaiah_38_3.htm">Isaiah 38:3</a>)<p>If you... walk contrary to Me..., and... do not obey (My voice)..., I also will walk contrary to you... (<a href="3927/leviticus_26_23.htm">Leviticus 26:23-24</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_26_27.htm">27-28</a>)<p>They would not walk in the ways (of Jehovah). (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a>; cf. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_11_22.htm">Deuteronomy 11:22</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_19_9.htm">19:9</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_26_17.htm">26:17</a>)<p>...all people walk... in the name of (their) god, but we will walk in the name of Jehovah... (<a href="3927/micah_4_5.htm">Micah 4:5</a>)<p>A little while longer the light is with you. Walk while you have the light... ...believe in the light... (<a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">John 12:35-36</a>; cf. <a href="3927/john_8_12.htm">8:12</a>)<p>...the scribes asked..., "Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders...?" (<a href="3927/mark_7_5.htm">Mark 7:5</a>)<p>Walking is also said of Jehovah, that He walks among people, which is to say that He lives in them and together with them:<p>I will make My dwelling among you, and... I will walk among you and be your God... (<a href="3927/leviticus_26_11.htm">Leviticus 26:11-12</a>)<p>It is apparent from this what is meant by the statement,<p>These things says He... who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 167</h4><p>167. 'And they shall walk with Me in white [for they are worthy]' signifies that they are going to be living with the Lord in His spiritual kingdom, because they are in truths from Him. This is the meaning of these words because 'to walk 'in the Word signifies to live, and 'to walk with God' signifies to live from Him, also because 'in white' signifies in truths. For in the Word white is predicated of truths because it derives its origin from the sun's light, and red is predicated of goods because it derives its origin from the sun's heat, while black is predicated of untruths because it derives its origin from the darkness of hell. Those are called 'worthy' who are in truths from the Lord, for all worthiness in the spiritual world is the result of conjunction with the Lord. It is plain from these considerations that by 'they shall walk with Me in white for they are worthy' is signified that they are going to be living with the Lord, because they are in truths from Him. It is said that they are going to be living with the Lord in the spiritual kingdom because the entire heaven has been distinguished into two kingdoms, the celestial and the spiritual, and those who are in good of love from the Lord are in the celestial kingdom, and in the spiritual kingdom are those who are in truths of wisdom from the Lord; and the latter are said to walk with the Lord in white; also they are clothed with white garments.</p><p>[2] That 'to walk' signifies to live, and that 'to walk with God' signifies to live with Him because from Him, is established from the following passages:<p>They walk <sup>1</sup>with Me in peace and rectitude, [<a href="3927/malachi_2_1.htm">Malachi 2</a>:[<a href="3927/malachi_2_6.htm">6</a>] Let us walk in the light of Jehovah]. <a href="3927/isaiah_2_5.htm">Isaiah 2:5</a>.<p>Thou hast delivered my feet from stumbling, for walking before God in the light of the living. <a href="3927/psalms_56_13.htm">Psalms 56:13</a>; [H.B. 14].<p>David has kept My commandments, and has walked after Me with all his heart, <a href="3927/1-kings_14_8.htm">1 Kings 14:8</a>.<p>Remember, O Jehovah, that I have walked before thee in the truth (veritas). <a href="3927/isaiah_38_3.htm">Isaiah 38:3</a>.<p>If you walk contrary to Me, and do nor obey My voice, then will I also walk contrary to you. <a href="3927/leviticus_26_23.htm">Leviticus 26:23-24</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_26_27.htm">27</a>.<p>They would not walk in the ways of Jehovah. <a href="3927/isaiah_42_24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a>.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 167</h4><p>167. And they shall walk with me, in white, <sup>1</sup>signifies that they will live with the Lord in His spiritual kingdom, because they are in truths from Him. That this is the meaning of these words is because "to walk," in the Word signifies to live, and "to walk with God" signifies to live from Him; and because "in white" signifies in truths; for in the Word, "white" is predicated of truths, because it draws its origin from the light of the sun; and "red" is predicated of goods, because it draws its origin from the fire of the sun; and "black" is predicated of falsities, because it draws its origin from the darkness of hell. They who are in truths from the Lord, because they are conjoined with Him are called "worthy," for all worth in the spiritual world is from conjunction with the Lord. From these things it is evident, that "they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy" signifies that they shall live with the Lord, because they are in the truths from Him. It is said that they will live with the Lord in the spiritual kingdom, because the whole heaven is divided in two kingdoms, the celestial and the spiritual, and they are in the celestial kingdom who are in the good of love from the Lord, and they are in the spiritual kingdom who are in the truths of wisdom from the Lord; and the latter are said "to walk with the Lord in white;" and they are also clothed in white garments.</p><p>[2] That "to walk" signifies to live, and "to walk with God" signifies to live with Him because from Him, appears from the following passages:<p>He walked with me in peace and rectitude, (<a href="3927/malachi_2_6.htm">Malachi 2:6</a>).<p>Thou hast delivered my feet from stumbling, to walk before God in the light of the living, (<a href="3927/psalms_56_13.htm">Psalms 56:13</a>).<p>David hath kept My commandments, and hath walked after Me with the whole heart, (<a href="3927/1-kings_14_8.htm">1 Kings 14:8</a>).<p>O Jehovah, remember that I have walked before Thee in truth, (<a href="3927/isaiah_38_3.htm">Isaiah 38:3</a>).<p>If ye will walk contrary to Me, and will not obey My voice, I also will walk contrary to you, (<a href="3927/leviticus_26_23.htm">Leviticus 26:23-24</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_26_27.htm">27-28</a>).<p>They would not walk in the ways of Jehovah, (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_11_22.htm">Deuteronomy 11:22</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_19_9.htm">19:9</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_26_17.htm">26:17</a>).<p>All peoples walk in the name of their god, and we will walk in the name of Jehovah, (<a href="3927/micah_4_5.htm">Micah 4:5</a>).<p>Yet a little while is the light with you; walk while ye have the light; believe in the light, (<a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">John 12:35-36</a>; <a href="3927/john_8_12.htm">8:12</a>).<p>The scribes asked, Why walk not the disciples according to the tradition of the elders? (<a href="3927/mark_7_5.htm">Mark 7:5</a>).<p>"To walk" is also said of Jehovah that "He walks among them," that is, lives in them and with them.<p>I will give my habitation in the midst of them, <sup>2</sup>and will walk in the midst of you, and will be unto you for God, (<a href="3927/leviticus_26_11.htm">Leviticus 26:11-12</a>).<p>From these passages it is manifest what is meant above by:<p>These things saith he that walketh in the midst of the seven golden lamp stands, (<a href="3927/revelation_2_1.htm">Revelation 2:1</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original Latin omits "for they are worthy," but it is explained in the text below.<br><br>2.&nbsp;The original Latin has "illorum" ("them"), the Hebrew is "you." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 167 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>167. "Et ambulabunt Mecum in albis (, quia digni sunt)," significat quod victuri sint cum Domino in Regno Ipsius spirituali, quia in veris sunt ad ipso. - Quod hic sensus illorum verborum sit, est quia "ambulare" in Verbo significat vivere, et "ambulare cum Deo" significat vivere ab Ipso; et quia in "albis" significat in veris; "album" enim in Verbo praedicatur de veris, quia trahit originem a luce solis, et "rubrum" praedicatur de bonis, quia trahit originem ab igne solis, ac "nigrum" praedicatur de falsis, quia trahit originem a tenebris inferni: illi qui in veris a Domino sunt, quia Ipsi conjuncti sunt, vocantur "digni," omnis enim dignitas in mundo spirituali est ex conjunctione cum Domino. Ex his patet, quod per "ambulabunt Mecum in albis quia digni sunt," significetur quod victuri sint cum Domino, quia in veris ab Ipso. Dicitur quod victuri sint cum Domino in Regno spirituali, quia universum Caelum in duo Regna distinctum est, caeleste et spirituale, et in Regno caelesti sunt qui in bono amoris a Domino sunt, et in Regno spirituali qui in veris sapientiae a Domino sunt; et hi dicuntur "ambulare cum Domino in albis;" sunt quoque induti vestimentis albis.
