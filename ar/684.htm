<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第684节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>684.“它们就变成了血”表被歪曲的圣言真理。“血”在正面意义上表示神性真理，在反面意义上表示被歪曲的神性真理（<a href="379.htm">379</a>节）。“血”之所以表示被歪曲和亵渎的神性真理，是因为犹太人流了主的血，而主是神性真理本身或圣言；他们这样做，是因为他们已经歪曲和亵渎了圣言的一切真理。主作为圣言遭受苦难，或犹太民族怎样向圣言施暴，就怎样向主施暴，这一事实可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》（<a href="../lord/15.htm">15</a>-17节）。那些陷入唯信的人之所以歪曲圣言的一切真理，是因为整部圣言论述遵行其中诫命的生活，论述主，主是耶和华和独一神，而那些陷入唯信的人并不思想遵行圣言诫命的生活，也不靠近主。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 684</h4><p>684. And they became blood. This symbolizes the Word's truths falsified.<p>Blood in a good sense symbolizes Divine truth, and in an opposite sense that truth falsified, as may be seen in no. <a href="379.htm">379</a> above. Blood symbolizes Divine truth falsified and profaned because Jews shed the Lord's blood, which was Divine truth itself or the Word, and they did this because they had falsified and profaned all the Word's truths. (That the Lord suffered as an embodiment of the Word, or in other words, that the Jewish nation did the same violence to the Lord as they had done to the Word, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord, nos. <a href="../lord/15.htm">15-17</a>.)<p>People caught up in faith alone falsify all the Word's truths, because the entire Word has to do with a life in accordance with the commandments in it, and with the Lord as being Jehovah and the only God; and people caught up in faith alone give no thought to a life in accordance with the commandments in the Word, nor do they approach the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 684</h4><p>684. 'And blood was produced' signifies falsified truths of the Word. That by 'blood' in a good sense is signified Divine Truth, and in the opposite sense the same falsified, may be seen above (<a href="379.htm">379</a>). The reason why Divine Truth falsified and profaned is signified by 'blood' is because the Jews shed the Lord's blood, which was Divine Truth Itself or the Word, and they did this because they falsified and profaned all the truths of the Word. That the Lord suffered as to the Word, or that the Jewish nation offered violence to the Lord just as they had offered it to the Word, may be seen in <a href="../lord/15.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord 15-17</a>. The reason why those who are in faith alone falsify all the truths of the Word is because the whole Word treats of a life in accordance with the precepts there, and of the Lord that He is Jehovah and the Only God, and those who are in faith alone do not think of a life in accordance with the precepts in the Word, nor do they approach the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 684</h4><p>684. And they became blood, signifies the truths of the Word falsified. That by "blood," in the good sense, is signified the Divine truth, and in the opposite sense, the Divine truth falsified, see above, (<a href="379.htm">379</a>[1-7]); the reason why Divine truth falsified and profaned is signified by "blood," is because the Jews shed the Lord's blood, who was the Divine truth itself, or the Word, and this they did because they had falsified and profaned all the truths of the Word. That the Lord suffered as the Word, or that the Jewish nation did the same violence to the Lord as they had done to the Word, may be seen in <a href="../lord/15.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem respecting the Lord 15-17</a>. The reason why they who are in faith alone falsify all the truths of the Word, is because the whole Word treats of life according to the commandments therein, and of the Lord that He is Jehovah and the only God, and they who are in faith alone, do not think of life according to the commandments in the Word, nor do they approach the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 684 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>684. "Et factus est sanguis," significat vera Verbi falsicata. -Quod per "sanguinem" in bono sensu significetur Divinum Verum, et in opposito sensu illud falsificatum, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_684/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_379" target=_top>379</a>) <sup>1</sup>, Quod Divinum Verum falsificatum et prophanatum significetur per "sanguinem," est quia Judaei effuderunt Sanguinem Domini, qui erat Ipsum Divinum Verum seu Verbum; et hoc fecerunt quia falsificaverunt et prophanaverunt omnia vera Verbi. Quod Dominus passus sit ut Verbum, seu quod Gens Judaica violentiam intulerit Domino, sicut intulerat Verbo, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_684/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_15" target=_top>Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 15-17</a>. Quod illi qui in sola Fide sunt, falsificent omnia vera Verbi, est quia totum Verbum agit de Vita secundum Praecepta ibi, et de Domino quod sit Jehovah et Solus Deus; et illi qui in sola Fide sunt, non cogitant de Vita secundum praecepta in Verbo, nec adeunt Dominum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;379 pro "373" </p>
