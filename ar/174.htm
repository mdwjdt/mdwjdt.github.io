<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第174节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>174.“拿着大卫的钥匙，开了就没有人能关，关了就没有人能开的”表唯独全能的拯救者。“大卫”表主的神性真理；“钥匙”表主掌管天堂与地狱的全能；“开了就没有人能关，关了就没有人能开”表领出地狱、引入天堂，从而施行拯救，和前面的解释一样（<a href="62.htm">62</a>节）。“大卫”表主的神性真理，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》（<a href="../lord/43.htm">43</a>-44节）一书。“彼得的钥匙”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.15.htm">16:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.19.htm">19</a>）与此处“大卫的钥匙”所表相同，这可见于下文的解释（<a href="798.htm">798</a>节）。主对门徒所说的这些话也一样：</p><p>凡你们在地上所捆绑的，在天上也要捆绑；凡你们在地上所释放的，在天上也要释放。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.18.htm">18:18</a>）</p><p>因为十二门徒代表教会的良善与真理的一切事物，彼得代表教会的真理，而真理与良善能拯救人，所以唯独它们所来自的主施行拯救。另外，“交与以利亚敬的大卫的钥匙”所表相同。论到这钥匙，经上说：</p><p>我必将你的政权交在他手中，他必作耶路撒冷居民和犹大家的父。我必将大卫家的钥匙放在他肩头上，他开，无人能关；他关，无人能开。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.21.htm">22:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.22.htm">22</a>）</p><p>以利亚敬将掌管王的家，而“王的家”表教会的神性真理。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 174</h4><p>174. "'Who has the key of David, who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one opens.'" This symbolically means, who alone has the omnipotence to save.<p>David means the Lord in respect to Divine truth. The key symbolizes the Lord's omnipotence over heaven and hell. And to open so that no one shuts, and to shut so that no one opens, means, symbolically, to lead out of hell and introduce into heaven, thus to save, the same as in no. <a href="62.htm">62</a> above, where this was explained.<p>To be shown that David means the Lord in respect to Divine truth, see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord, nos. <a href="43.htm">43</a>, <a href="44.htm">44</a>.<p>The symbolic meaning of the key here is the same as that of the keys of Peter (<a href="3927/matthew_16_15.htm">Matthew 16:15-19</a>), <sup>1</sup>as may be seen explained in no. <a href="798.htm">798</a> below. The same is also meant by this declaration to all the disciples,<p>Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. (<a href="3927/matthew_18_18.htm">Matthew 18:18</a>)<p>For the twelve disciples represented all elements of the church as regards its goods and truths, while Peter represented the church in respect to its truth; and it is truths and goods, thus the Lord from whom they come, that save a person.<p>The key of David given to Eliakim has also the same meaning, concerning which we read,<p>I will give your government into his hands, that he may be as a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah, and I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David, so that he may open and no one shut, and close and no one open. (<a href="3927/isaiah_22_21.htm">Isaiah 22:21-22</a>)<p>The person referred to as he here was the person over the house of the king, and the house of the king symbolizes the church in respect to Divine truth.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;[Jesus] said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." Jesus answered and said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven." (<a href="3927/matthew_16_15.htm">Matthew 16:15-19</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 174</h4><p>174. 'Having the key of David, and opening and no one shuts, and shutting and no one opens' signifies Who Only has the Omnipotence to save. By 'David' is understood the Lord as to Divine Truth; by 'the key' is signified the Lord's Omnipotence over heaven and hell; and by 'opening that no one may shut' and by 'shutting that no one may open' is signified to lead forth out of hell and introduce into heaven thus to save in like manner as above (<a href="62.htm">62</a>), where it has been expounded. That by 'David' is understood the Lord as to Divine Truth may be seen [in] <a href="../lord/43.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD 43-44</a>). Something similar to what is here signified by the key of David is signified by 'Peter's keys' (<a href="3927/matthew_16_15.htm">Matthew 16:15-19</a>), which passage may be seen expounded below (<a href="798.htm">798</a>), as also by these words to all the disciples:<p>Whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. <a href="3927/matthew_18_18.htm">Matthew 18:18</a>.<p>For the twelve disciples were representing all things of the Church as to its good and truths, while Peter was representing it as to truth, and truths and goods save man, thus the Only Lord from Whom they are. A similar thing is understood also by the 'key of David' given to Eliakim, of which it is thus [written]:<p>I will give the dominion into his hand, that he may become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the house of Judah, and I will give the key of the house of David upon his shoulder, that he may open and none shall shut, and shut and none shall open. <a href="3927/isaiah_22_21.htm">Isaiah 22:21-22</a>.<p>He was over the king's house, and by 'the king's house' is signified the Church as to Divine Truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 174</h4><p>174. He that hath the key of David, and that openeth and no one shutteth, and shutteth and no one openeth, signifies, who alone is omnipotent to save. By "David" is meant the Lord as to the Divine truth; by "key" is signified the Lord's omnipotence over heaven and hell; and by "opening that no one can shut," and by "shutting that no one can open," is signified to lead forth out of hell and introduce into heaven, thus to save, in like manner as above, (<a href="62.htm">62</a>), where it is explained. That by "David" is meant the Lord as to the Divine truth, may be seen in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord, (<a href="43.htm">43</a>, <a href="44.htm">44</a>). The same, which is here signified by "the key of David," is also signified by "the keys of Peter" (<a href="3927/matthew_16_15.htm">Matthew 16:15-19</a>); which may be seen explained below, (<a href="798.htm">798</a>[1-5]) also by these words to all the disciples:<p>Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven, (<a href="3927/matthew_18_18.htm">Matthew 18:18</a>).<p>For the twelve disciples represented all things of the church as to its goods and truths, and Peter represented it as to truth, and truths and goods save man, consequently the Lord alone from whom they are. The same is also signified by the "key of David which was given to Eliakim," concerning which it is thus written:<p>I will give the government into his hands, and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah, and I will give the key of the house of David upon his shoulder, so he shall open and none shall shut, and he shall shut and none shall open, (<a href="3927/isaiah_22_21.htm">Isaiah 22:21-22</a>).<p>He was over the king's house, and by "the king's house" is signified the church as to the Divine truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 174 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>174. "Habens clavem Davidis, et aperiens et nemo claudit, ac claudens et nemo aperit," significat Cui Soli est Omnipotentia salvandi. - Per "Davidem" intelligitur Dominus quoad in Verum; per "clavem" significatur Omnipotentia Domini super Caelum et Infernum; et per "aperire ut nemo claudat," et per "claudere ut nemo aperiat," significatur e ex Inferno et introducere in Caelum, ita salvare, educere ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_174/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_62" target=_top>62</a>), ubi explicatum est. Quod per "Davidem" intelligatur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, videatur (in) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_174/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_43" target=_top>Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 43-44</a>. Simile quod hic per "clavem Davidis," significatur per Claves Petri, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_174/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_16_15-19" target=_top>Matthaeus 16:15-19</a>), <p>quae explicata videantur infra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_174/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_798" target=_top>798</a>); tum etiam per haec verba ad omnes discipulos: <p>"Quaecunque ligaveritis in terra erunt ligata in Caelo, et quaecunque solveritis in terra erunt soluta in Caelo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_174/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_18_18" target=_top>Matthaeus 18:18</a>);<p>duodecim enim Discipuli repraesentabant omnia Ecclesiae quoad ejus bona et vera, ac Petrus repraesentabat illam quoad verum, ac vera et bona salvant hominem, ita Solus Dominus a Quo illa sunt. Simile etiam intelligitur per "clavem Davidis" datam Eliakimo, de quo ita: <p>"Dabo dominium in manus ejus, ut sit in patrem habitatoris Hierosolymae et domus Jehudae, et dabo Clavem domus Davidis super humerum ejus, ut aperiat et non claudens, accidat et non aperiens," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_174/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_22_21-22" target=_top>Esaias 22:21-22</a>);<p>erat ille super domo Regis, et per "domum Regis" significatur Ecclesia quoad Divinum Verum. </p>
