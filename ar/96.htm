<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第96节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>96.“也知道那自称是犹太人、其实不是所说的毁谤话”表错误断言他们处于爱之良善，其实并未处于爱之良善。“亵渎话”在此表错误的断言；“犹太人”并非表犹太人，而是表那些处于爱之良善的人，抽象而言，表爱之良善；因此“那自称是犹太人、其实不是所说的毁谤话”表错误断言他们处于爱之良善，其实并未处于爱之良善。“犹太人”之所以表示那些处于爱之良善的人，是因为在圣言中，“犹大”在至高意义上表示主的神性之爱的神性良善，“以色列”表示主的神性智慧的神性真理；因此，“犹太人”表示那些处于来自主的爱之良善之人，“以色列人”表示那些处于来自主的神性真理之人。这些人就是“犹太人”所指的，这一点下文（<a href="350.htm">350</a>节）所引用的许多经文明显可知，有关该主题的相关内容也可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/51.htm">51</a>节）。从抽象意义上说，“犹太人”表爱之良善，因为灵义是从人物抽象出来的（<a href="78.htm">78</a>，<a href="79.htm">79</a>节）。人若不知“犹太人”在圣言中表示那些属于主的属天教会之人，他们就是处于对主之爱的人，那么在读圣言的先知书时，必陷入许多错误中。关于这一点，可见下文（<a href="350.htm">350</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 96</h4><p>96. "'And the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not.'" This symbolizes their false speaking in saying that they have among them goods of love, when in fact they do not.<p>Blasphemy here means, symbolically, false speaking. Jews do not mean Jews, but people who possess the goodness of love, and abstractly goods of love themselves. Consequently the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not means, symbolically, their false speaking in saying that they have among them goods of love, when in fact they do not.<p>Jews mean people who possess the goodness of love because in the highest sense in the Word, Judah means the Lord in respect to the Divine goodness of His Divine love, and Israel means the Lord in respect to the Divine truth of His Divine wisdom. Therefore Jews symbolize people who possess the goodness of love from the Lord, and Israel people who possess Divine truths from the Lord.<p>That Jews mean people of this character can be seen from many passages in the Word, which will be cited in no. <a href="350.htm">350</a> below. See also some remarks in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture<a href="../ss/51.htm">51</a>.<p>Jews abstractly mean goods of love because the spiritual sense is abstracted from person, as may be seen in no. <a href="78.htm">78</a>, <a href="79.htm">79</a> above.<p>When reading the Word in the Prophets, someone may be much deluded if he does not know that in the Word Jews mean people who belong to the Lord's celestial church, who are people prompted by love toward Him. But see no. <a href="350.htm">350</a> below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 96</h4><p>96. 'And the blasphemy of them who say they are Jews, and are not' signifies the untrue assertion that the goods of love are with them, when yet they are not. 'Blasphemy' here signifies an untrue assertion; by 'Jews' are not signified the Jews but those who are in the good of love, and abstractly the good of love. Consequently by 'the blasphemy of them who say they are Jews, and are not' is signified the untrue assertion that the goods of love are with them, when yet they are not. Those who are in the good of love are understood by 'Jews' because by 'Judah' in the supreme sense in the Word is understood the Lord as to the Divine Good of the Divine Love, and by 'Israel' the Lord as to the Divine Truth of the Divine Wisdom. Consequently by 'Jews' are signified those who from the Lord are in the good of love, and by 'Israel' those who from the Lord are in Divine truths. That these are understood by 'Jews' can be established from many passages therein, which will be adduced below (<a href="350.htm">350</a>). Some things may also be seen in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE <sup>1</sup>(<a href="51.htm">51</a>). That the goods of love are understood abstractly by 'Jews,' because the spiritual sense is abstracted from persons, may be seen above (<a href="78.htm">78-79</a>). He who does not know that by 'Jews' in the Word are understood those who belong to the Lord's celestial Church, who are those who are in a love directed to Him, can be greatly deluded in the reading of the Word in the Prophets; but <a href="350.htm">350</a> below may be seen.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Original Edition has DOMINO (THE LORD), but it is clear that SCRIPTURA SACRA (THE SACRED SCRIPTURE) is intended. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 96</h4><p>96. And the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews, and are not, signifies the false assertion that the goods of love are with them, when yet they are not. "Blasphemy" here signifies a false assertion; by "Jews" are not signified Jews, but they who are in the good of love, and, abstractly, the goods of love; so by "the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not," is signified the false assertion that the goods of love are with them, when yet they are not. By "Jews" are meant they who are in the good of love, because in the Word by "Judah," in the supreme sense, is meant the Lord as to the Divine good of Divine love, and by "Israel" the Lord as to the Divine truth of Divine wisdom; hence by "Jews" are signified they who are in the good of love from the Lord, and by "Israel" they who are in Divine truths from the Lord. That these are meant by "Jews," may appear from many passages, which will be adduced below, (<a href="350.htm">350</a>); something may also be seen on this subject in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, (<a href="51.htm">51</a>). <sup>1</sup>In the abstract sense the goods of love are meant by "Jews," because the spiritual sense is abstracted from persons, as may be seen above, (<a href="78.htm">78</a>, <a href="79.htm">79</a>). He who does not know that by "Jews," in the Word, are meant those who are of the Lord's celestial church, who are they that are in love to Him, may fall into many mistakes when reading the Word in the prophets; but see below, (<a href="350.htm">350</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original Latin has "The Lord." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 96 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>96. "Et blasphemiam dicentium Judaeos esse se, et non sunt," significat falsiloquium quod apud illos sint bona amoris, cum tamen non sunt. - "Blasphemia" hic significat falsiloquium; per "Judaeos" non significantur Judaei, sed illi qui in bono amoris sunt, et abstracte bona amoris; inde per "blasphemiam dicentium Judaeos esse se, et non sunt," significatur falsiloquium quod apud illos bona amoris sint, cum tamen non sunt. Quod per "Judaeos" intelligantur qui in bono amoris sunt, est quia per "Jehudam" in supremo Sensu in Verbo intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris, et per "Israelem" Dominus quoad Divinum Verum Divinae Sapientiae; inde per "Judaeos" significantur qui in bono amoris a Domino sunt, et per "Israelem" qui in Divinis veris a Domino sunt: quod illi per "Judaeos" intelligantur, constare potest a multis locis ibi, quae adducentur infra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_96/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_350" target=_top>350</a>); videantur etiam aliqua in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra <sup>1</sup>(<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_96/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_51" target=_top>51</a>). Quod per "Judaeos" abstracte intelligantur bona amoris, est quia Sensus spiritualis est abstractus a personis, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_96/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_78" target=_top>78</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_96/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_79" target=_top>79</a>). Qui non scit, quod per "Judaeos" in Verbo intelligantur illi qui ab Ecclesia caelesti Domini sunt, qui sunt qui in amore in Ipsum, multum hallucinari potest in lectione Verbi apud Prophetas, sed videatur infra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_96/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_350" target=_top>350</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;de Scriptura Sacra pro "de Domino" </p>
