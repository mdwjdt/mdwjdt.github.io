<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第920节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>920.启21:24.“得救的列族要在城的光里行走”表所有处于生活的良善，并信主的人都将在那里照神性真理生活，并在自己里面从内在看到这些真理，如同肉眼看到物体那样。“列族”表示那些处于生活的良善之人，以及那些陷入生活的邪恶之人（<a href="483.htm">483</a>节），在此表示那些处于生活的良善，并信主的人，因为经上说“得救的列族”。“在光里行走”表示照神性真理生活并在自己里面从内在看到这些真理，如同肉眼看到物体那样；因为属灵视觉的物体属于内在的理解力，都是属灵的真理；那些处于这种理解力的人看这些真理，就如同肉眼看属世的物体。“光”在此表示凭他们里面来自主的内在启示而对神性真理的领悟（<a href="796.htm">796</a>节）；“行走”表示生活（<a href="167.htm">167</a>节）。由此明显可知，在“新耶路撒冷的光里行走”表示凭内在启示领悟并看到神性真理，以及照之生活。</p><p>不过，必须说明这一点，因为人们不知道此处“列族”和本节接下来的“君王”是指谁。“列族”表示那些处于来自主的爱之良善之人，这种良善被称为属天良善；“君王”表示那些凭来自主的属灵良善而处于智慧之真理的人，如下一节所述。那些处于来自主的属天良善之人都拥有铭刻在自己生命中的神性真理，所以他们“行走”，也就是照它们正直地生活，以及在自己里面从内在看到它们，如同肉眼看到物体那样，关于他们的相关内容，前面所有记载（参看<a href="120.htm">120</a>-123节）。所有天堂都划分为两个国度，即属天国度和属灵国度。属天国度的良善被称属天良善，就是对主之爱的良善，属灵国度的良善被称为属灵良善，就是智慧的良善，本质上是真理。关于这两个国度的相关内容，可参看前文（<a href="647.htm">647</a>，<a href="725.htm">725</a>，<a href="854.htm">854</a>节）。</p><p>教会也一样，教会中那些照正义的诫命生活乃因它们是神性律法，就像文明人照正义的诫命生活乃因它们是世间律法那样的人就是属天的。他们之间的不同之处在于，前者只要将正义的世间律法当成神性律法，就能凭其照诫命或律法的生活而成为天堂的公民。此处“列族”所表示的那些人，即如前所述，神性真理被铭刻在里面的人，就是耶利米书中这段经文所指的那些人：</p><p>我要将我的律法放在他们中间，写在他们心上；各人不再教导自己的邻舍和自己的弟兄，说，你该认识耶和华，因为他们从最小的到至大的都必认识我。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.33.htm">31:33</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.34.htm">34</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 920</h4><p>920. <a href="3927/revelation_21_24.htm">21:24</a> And the nations that are saved shall walk in its light. This symbolically means that all those people who live a good life and believe in the Lord will live in the New Church in accordance with Divine truths and will see those truths inwardly in themselves as the eye sees its objects.<p>The nations symbolize people who live a good life, and also people who live an evil life (no. <a href="483.htm">483</a>). Here they symbolize people who live a good life and believe in the Lord, because they are called nations that are saved. To walk in light means, symbolically, to live in accordance with Divine truths and to see them inwardly in oneself as the eye sees objects. For the objects of spiritual sight, which are those of the inner intellect, are spiritual truths, and people who possess that intellect see them in a manner analogous to the way the eyes see natural objects. The light here symbolizes a perception of Divine truth from an inner enlightenment in those people from the Lord (no. <a href="796.htm">796</a>), and to walk symbolizes to live (no. <a href="167.htm">167</a>). From this it is apparent that to walk in the light of the New Jerusalem symbolically means to perceive and see Divine truths from an inner enlightenment and to live in accordance with them.</p><p>[2] But we need to illustrate this, because people do not know who are meant by the nations here, and by the kings mentioned next in this verse. The nations symbolize people who are impelled by the goodness of love received from the Lord, a goodness we call celestial goodness; and kings symbolize people who are impelled by truths of wisdom springing from a spiritual goodness received from the Lord, as we will see in the next number. People impelled by a celestial goodness from the Lord all have Divine truths engraved on their life. Therefore they walk, that is to say, live, uprightly in accordance with them, and they also see them inwardly in themselves, as the eye sees its objects. On this subject, see what we said in nos. <a href="120.htm">120-123</a> above.<p>All of the heavens have been distinguished into two kingdoms: the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom. The goodness of the celestial kingdom we call celestial goodness, which is the goodness of love for the Lord, and the goodness of the spiritual kingdom we call spiritual goodness, and it is the goodness of wisdom, which in its essence is truth. Regarding these two kingdoms, see nos. <a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="725.htm">725</a>, <a href="854.htm">854</a> above.</p><p>[3] It is the same with the church, and those people are celestial there who live in accordance with the precepts of justice because they are Divine laws, as a civic-minded person lives in accordance with the precepts of justice because they are civil laws. But the difference between them is that, by his living in accordance with those precepts or laws, the celestial person is a citizen of heaven, to the extent that he inwardly regards civil laws that are laws of justice as also Divine laws.<p>Those people who are here symbolized by the nations, who have, as we said, Divine truths engraved on them, are the people meant in Jeremiah:<p>I will put My law in the midst of them and write it on their hearts..., and no more shall anyone teach his companion or anyone his brother, saying, "Know Jehovah," for they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 920</h4><p>920. [verse 241 'And the nations that are being saved shall walk in the light thereof' signifies that all who are in good of life and believe in the Lord shall live there in accordance with Divine truths, and they shall see those truths inwardly in themselves as the eye sees objects. By 'the nations' are signified those who are in good of life, and also those who are in evil of life (<a href="483.htm">483</a>), here those who are in good of life and believe in the Lord, because it is said 'the nations that are being saved.' 'To walk in the light' signifies to live in accordance with Divine truths, and to see those inwardly in themselves as the eye sees objects, for the objects of spiritual sight, which is of the interior understanding, are spiritual truths, and these are seen by those who are in that understanding just as natural objects are seen before the eyes. By 'the light' here is signified the perception of Divine Truth by virtue of interior enlightenment from the Lord with them (<a href="796.htm">796</a>); and by 'to walk' is signified to live (<a href="167.htm">167</a>). It is therefore plain that by to walk in the light of the New Jerusalem' is signified to perceive and see Divine truths by virtue of an interior enlightenment, and to live in accordance therewith.</p><p>[2] But this must be illustrated, because it is not known who are understood here by the nations,' and who by 'the kings' concerning whom [something] follows in this verse. By 'the nations' are signified those who are in the good of love from the Lord, this good being called celestial good; and by 'the kings' are signified those who are in truths of wisdom by virtue of spiritual good from the Lord, treated of in the following paragraph. Those who are in celestial good from the Lord all have Divine truths inscribed on their life, and therefore they 'walk,' that is, live justly in accordance therewith, and also they see them inwardly in themselves just as the eye sees objects, concerning whom the things recorded above (<a href="120.htm">120-123</a>) may be seen. All the heavens have been distinguished into two kingdoms, the celestial and the spiritual. The good of the celestial kingdom is called celestial good, which is the good of love directed to the Lord, and the good of the spiritual kingdom is called spiritual good, and is the good of wisdom, which in its essence is truth. Concerning these two kingdoms the things above (<a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="725.htm">725</a>, <a href="854.htm">854</a>) may be seen.</p><p>[3] It is similar with the Church, and the men there are celestial who live in accordance with just precepts because they are Divine laws, just as a citizen (homo civilis) lives in accordance with just precepts because they are civil laws. But the difference between them is that the former, by virtue of his life in accordance with the precepts or laws, is a citizen of heaven in so far as he makes the civil laws that are of justice Divine laws also. Those who are signified here by 'the nations,' upon whom, as was said, Divine truths have been inscribed, are those who are understood in Jeremiah:<p>I will put My law in the midst of them, and will write it upon their heart; and they shall no more teach every man his neighbour or every man his brother, saying, Recognise Jehovah, for they shall all recognise Me from the least of them unto the greatest of them. <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 920</h4><p>920. Verse 24. And the nations which are saved shall walk in the light of it, signifies that all who are in the good of life, and believe in the Lord, will there live according to Divine truths, and will see them inwardly in themselves, as the eye sees objects. By "the nations" are signified they who are in the good of life, and also they who are in evil of life, (<a href="483.htm">483</a>); here they who are in the good of life and believe in the Lord, because it is said, "the nations which are saved;" "to walk in the light," signifies to live according to Divine truths, and to see them inwardly in themselves, as the eye sees objects, for the objects of spiritual sight, which is of the interior understanding, are spiritual truths, which are seen by those who are in that understanding, in like manner as natural objects are seen before the eyes; by "light" is here signified the perception of Divine truth from interior enlightenment from the Lord with them, (<a href="796.htm">796</a>), and by "to walk" is signified to live, (<a href="167.htm">167</a>[1-2]). Hence it is evident, that by "to walk in the light of the New Jerusalem," is signified to perceive and see Divine truths from interior enlightenment, and to live according to them.</p><p>[2] But this must be illustrated, because it is not known who are here meant by "the nations," and who by "the kings," mentioned afterwards in this verse; by "the nations" are signified they who are in the good of love from the Lord, which good is called celestial good, and by "kings" are signified they who are in the truths of wisdom from spiritual good from the Lord, as will be seen in the next article. All they who are in celestial good from the Lord, have Divine truths inscribed on their life, wherefore "they walk," that is, live justly according to them and likewise see them inwardly in themselves, as the eye sees objects, on which subject see what is related above, (<a href="120.htm">120-123</a>). All the heavens are distinguished into two kingdoms, the celestial and the spiritual; the good of the celestial kingdom is called celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord, and the good of the spiritual kingdom is called spiritual good, and is the good of wisdom, which in its essence is truth; concerning these two kingdoms see above, (<a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="725.htm">725</a>, <a href="854.htm">854</a>).</p><p>[3] It is the same with the church; and there the men are celestial, who live justly according to the commandments because they are Divine laws, as in like manner a civil man lives according to the commandments of justice because they are civil laws; but the difference between them is, that the former, by a life according to the commandments or laws, is a citizen of heaven as far as in himself he makes the civil laws, which are laws of justice, Divine laws also. They who are here signified by "nations," on whom, as before said, Divine truths are inscribed, are they who are meant in Jeremiah:<p>I will put My Law in the midst of them, and write it upon their heart; neither shall they teach anymore everyone his companion, and everyone his brother, saying, Know ye Jehovah; for they shall all know Me from the least of them unto the greatest, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 920 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>920. (Vers. 24.) "Et gentes quae salvantur in luce ejus ambulabunt," significat quod omnes qui in bono vitae sunt et credunt in Dominum, ibi vivent secundum Divina vera, et videbunt illa intus in se, sicut oculus objecta. - Per "gentes" significantur qui in bono vitae sunt, et quoque qui in malo vitae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_920/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_483" target=_top>483</a>); hic qui in bono vitae sunt, et credunt in Dominum, quia dicitur, "gentes quae salvantur:" "in luce ambulare" significat vivere secundum Divina vera, et videre illa intus in se, sicut oculus objecta; objecta enim visus spiritualis, qui est interioris intellectus, sunt vera spiritualia, quae similiter ab illis, qui in illo intellectu sunt, videntur, sicut objecta naturalia coram oculis; per "lucem" hic significatur perceptio Divini Veri ex interiore illustratione a Domino apud illos (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_920/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_796" target=_top>796</a>), et per "ambulare" significatur vivere (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_920/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_167" target=_top>167</a>); inde patet quod per "in luce" Novae Hierosolymae "ambulare," significetur ex interiore illustratione percipere et videre Divina vera, et vivere secundum illa: sed hoc illustrandum est, quia nescitur quinam per "gentes" hic intelliguntur, et quinam per "reges," de quibus in hoc versu sequitur. Per "gentes" significantur qui in bono amoris a Domino sunt, quod bonum vocatur bonum caeleste, et per "reges" significantur qui in veris sapientiae ex bono spirituali a Domino sunt, de quibus in sequente articulo; illi qui in bono caelesti a Domino sunt, omnes habent Divina vera vitae suae inscripta; quare "ambulant," hoc est, vivunt juste secundum illa, et quoque vident illa intus in se, sicut oculus objecta (de quibus videantur quae supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_920/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_120" target=_top>120-123</a>, memorata sunt). Omnes Caeli distincti sunt in duo Regna, caeleste et spirituale; bonum Regni caelestis vocatur bonum caeleste, quod est bonum amoris in Dominum; et bonum Regni spiritualis vocatur bonum spirituale, et est bonum sapientiae, quod in sua essentia est verum: de binis his Regnis, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_920/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_647" target=_top>647</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_920/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725" target=_top>725</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_920/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_854" target=_top>854</a>). Simile est cum Ecclesia; et ibi homines caelestes sunt, qui vivunt secundum praecepta justi <sup>1</sup>quia reges Divinae sunt, sicut homo civilis vivit secundum praecepta justi quia leges civiles sunt; sed differentia illorum est, quod prior ex vita sua secundum praecepta seu leges sit civis Caeli, quantum apud se facit leges civiles, quae justitiae sunt, etiam leges Divinas. Illi qui per "gentes" hic significantur, quibus, ut dictum est, Divina vera sunt inscripta, sunt qui intelliguntur apud Jeremiam: <p>"Dabo Legem Meam in medio eorum, et super cor illorum scribam illam; neque docebunt quis amplius socium suum aut quis fratrem suum, dicendo, Cognoscite Jehovam; omnes enim cognoscet Me a minimo eorum usque ad maximum eorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_920/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_31_33-34" target=_top>31:33-34</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;justi pro "juste" </p>
