<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 345</h4><p>345. Having the seal of the living God. This symbolically means, who alone knows the character of each and every person, and can distinguish and separate them from each other.<p>Since they were sealed on their foreheads with the seal, therefore having the seal of the living God, being said in reference to the Lord, means to know the character of each and every person, and to be able to distinguish and separate the servants of God from those who are not servants of God. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 345</h4><p>345. 'Having the seal of the living God' signifies Who alone has a knowledge of all [men] and of individuals, and is able to distinguish and separate them each one from the other. Since they were being sealed upon their foreheads with the seal, therefore by 'to have the seal of the living God,' since it concerns the Lord, is understood to get to know all collectively and individually, and to be able to distinguish and separate the 'servants of God' from those who are not the servants of God. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 345</h4><p>345. Having the seal of the living God, signifies who alone knows all and each, and can distinguish and separate them one from another. Since they were sealed on their foreheads with a seal, therefore by "having the seal of the living God," as spoken of the Lord is meant to know all and each, and to be able to distinguish and separate the servants of God from those who are not servants of God. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 345 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>345. "Habentem sigillum Dei vivi," significat Qui unice cognoscit omnes et singulos, et illos a se invicem potest distinguere et separare. - Quoniam signabantur super frontibus per sigillum, ideo per "habere sigillum Dei vivi," quia de Domino, intelligitur nosse omnes et singulos, ac posse distinguere et separare servos Dei ab illis qui non servi Dei sunt. </p>
