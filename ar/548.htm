<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第548节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>548.启12:7.“在天上就有了争战。米迦勒同他的使者与龙争战。龙也同它的使者去争战”表前教会的虚假与新教会的真理争战。“争战”表示属灵的战争，也就是虚假反对真理，真理反对虚假（<a href="500.htm">500</a>节），因为在天堂不可能发生其它战争，可以说这种战争在那里已经爆发了；天堂一旦由天使形成，战争也不可能在那里发生；这战争发生在“已经过去了”的“先前的天”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.1.htm">21:1</a>）。关于“先前的天”，可参看那一节经文的解读；那个天之所以已经过去了，是因为对龙及其使者执行了最后审判，也就是“大龙被摔下来”和“天上再没有它们的地方”所表示的，这一点从下文明显看出来。至于“龙”所表示、即将与新教会的真理争战的虚假是什么，可参看前文（<a href="537.htm">537</a>节）。“米迦勒”不是指任何天使长，“加百列”和“拉斐尔”也不是，而是指天上的职分；“米迦勒”所表示的职分由这样的人承担：他们通过圣言确认，主就是天和地之神，并且父神与主为一，如灵魂与身体为一那样；还确认，人当照十诫生活，然后人才拥有仁与信。“米迦勒”在但以理书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.13.htm">10:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.21.htm">21</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/但12.1.htm">12:1</a>）也被提及，表示同样的职分，这一点从但以理书9-11章，以及12章最后几节明显看出来。而“加百列”所表示的职分由这样的人承担：他们通过圣言教导，耶和华来到世间，祂在世所披的人身就是“神的儿子”，并且是神性；由于这个原因，向马利亚宣告这一点的那位天使被称为“加百列”（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.19.htm">1:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.26.htm">26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.35.htm">35</a>）。从事这些职分的人在天上也被称为“米迦勒”和“加百列”。“天使”（或译为使者）在至高意义上表示主；在相对意义上表示天使天堂，以及天使社群（参看<a href="5.htm">5</a>，<a href="65.htm">65</a>，<a href="258.htm">258</a>，<a href="342.htm">342</a>，<a href="344.htm">344</a>，<a href="415.htm">415</a>，<a href="465.htm">465</a>节）；但在此表示职分，因为经上提到了他们的“名字”；在但以理书，“米迦勒”还被称为“首领”（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.13.htm">10:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.21.htm">21</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/但12.1.htm">12:1</a>）；在圣言中，“首领”（prince）表示首要真理，而“王”（king）表示真理本身（<a href="20.htm">20</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 548</h4><p>548. And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and its angels fought. (<a href="3927/revelation_12_7.htm">12:7</a>) This symbolizes the falsities of the previous church fighting against the truths of the New Church.<p>A war symbolizes a spiritual war, which is one of falsity against truth and of truth against falsity (no. <a href="500.htm">500</a>); for that is the only war that can take place in heaven, where this war is said to have broken out. Nor can a spiritual war take place in any heaven once it is formed by angels, but it took place in the previous heaven which passed away, as said in <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>. Regarding that heaven, see our exposition of that verse. For that heaven passed away in consequence of the Last Judgment on the dragon and his angels, which is also the symbolic meaning of the dragon's being cast out and no place for it being found in heaven any longer, as said in the next verse.<p>To learn what falsities are meant by the dragon which will fight against the truths of the New Church, see no. <a href="537.htm">537</a> above.<p>Michael does not mean some archangel, and neither does Gabriel or Raphael, but ministries in heaven are meant. The ministry that is Michael there is performed by people who confirm from the Word that the Lord is God of heaven and earth, that God the Father and the Lord are one as soul and body are one, that one must live according to the Ten Commandments, and that a person then possesses charity and faith. Michael is mentioned also in <a href="3927/daniel_10_13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_10_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_12_1.htm">12:1</a>, and the same ministry is meant by him, as is apparent from chapters 9-11 there, and from the last verses in chapter 12.<p>Gabriel, on the other hand, means the ministry performed by people who teach from the Word that Jehovah came into the world and that the humanity that he took on there is the Son of God and Divine. The angel who announced this to Mary is accordingly called Gabriel (<a href="3927/luke_1_19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_26.htm">26-35</a>).<p>People who are engaged in these ministries are also called Michaels and Gabriels in heaven.<p>It may be seen in numbers <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="65.htm">65</a>, <a href="258.htm">258</a>, <a href="342.htm">342</a>, <a href="344.htm">344</a>, <a href="415.htm">415</a>, <a href="465.htm">465</a> above that an angel in the highest sense means the Lord, and in a relative sense heaven, which is formed of angels, and also an angelic society. But here it means a ministry, because it is named; and in Daniel Michael is called a prince, <sup>1</sup>and a prince in the Word symbolizes a principal truth, and a king, truth itself (no. <a href="20.htm">20</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="3927/daniel_10_13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_10_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_12_1.htm">12:1</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 548</h4><p>548. [verse 7] 'And a war was waged in heaven, Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels' signifies the untruths of the former Church fighting against the truths of the New Church. By 'a war' is signified a spiritual war, which is of untruth against truth, and of truth against untruth (<a href="500.htm">500</a>), for in heaven, where it is said to have taken place, no other 'war' can be waged. Nor can it take place in a heaven once formed from angels, but it was waged in the 'former heaven' that 'passed away,' treated of in <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>, concerning which heaven the Exposition there may be seen. For that heaven passed away by means of the last judgment upon 'the dragon and his angels,' and this is indeed signified by the dragon's having been cast down and his place no longer found in heaven, as it follows on. What sort of untruths are understood by 'the dragon,' and that are going to fight against the truths of the New Church, may be seen above (<a href="537.htm">537</a>). By 'Michael' is not understood any archangel, nor by 'Gabriel' and 'Raphael,' but ministries in heaven are understood. The ministry that is 'Michael' there, is with those who confirm out of the Word that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth and that God the Father and He are one as soul and body are one, also that [life] must be lived in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue, and that in that case a man has charity and faith. 'Michael' is named in Daniel also (<a href="3927/daniel_10_13.htm">10:13</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_10_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_12_1.htm">12:1</a>), and by him a like ministry is understood, as is plain there from chapters <a href="3927/revelation_9_1.htm">9</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_10_1.htm">10</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_11_1.htm">11</a>, and the last verses of chapter <a href="3927/revelation_12_1.htm">12</a>. By 'Gabriel,' however, is understood the ministry with those who teach out of the Word that Jehovah has come into the world and that the Human He acquired there is the Son of God and Divine. For this reason the angel who announced this to Mary is called 'Gabriel' (<a href="3927/luke_1_19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_26.htm">26-35</a>). Those who are in those ministries are also named 'Michaels' and 'Gabriels' in heaven. That by 'an angel' in the highest sense is understood the Lord, and in the relative sense the heaven [formed] out of angels, then also the angelic societies, may be seen above (<a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="65.htm">65</a>, <a href="258.htm">258</a>, <a href="342.htm">342</a>, <a href="344.htm">344</a>, <a href="415.htm">415</a>, <a href="465.htm">465</a>). Here, however, a ministry [is understood] because they are named, and 'Michael' in Daniel is called 'a prince,' and by 'a prince' in the Word is signified a principal truth, and by 'a king' the Truth itself (<a href="20.htm">20</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 548</h4><p>548. Verse 7. And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, signifies the falsities of the former church fighting against the truths of the New Church. By "war" is signified spiritual war, which is of falsity against truth, and truth against falsity, (<a href="500.htm">500</a>), for no other war can take place in heaven, where this is said to have existed; neither can it take place in heaven, when once formed of angels; but it was done in "the former heaven which passed away" (spoken of in <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). Concerning which heaven, see the explanation there given; for that heaven passed away by the Last Judgment on the dragon and his angels, which is also signified by "the dragon was cast down, and his place was found no more in heaven," as appears from what follows. What the falsities are, which are meant by "the dragon," and which are about to fight against the truths of the New Church, may be seen above, (<a href="537.htm">537</a>). By "Michael" is not meant any archangel; neither by "Gabriel, and Raphael," but ministries in heaven are meant; the ministry signified by "Michael" is performed by those who confirm from the Word, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that God the Father and He are one, as the soul and body are one; also that men ought to live according to the commandments of the Decalogue, and that then men have charity and faith. "Michael" is also mentioned in <a href="3927/daniel_10_13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_10_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_10_2.htm">10:2</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_12_1.htm">12:1</a>); and by him a similar ministry is meant, as appears from chapters 9-11, and from the last verses of chapter 12. But by "Gabriel" is meant the ministry of those who teach from the Word, that Jehovah came into the world, and that the Human He there assumed is the Son of God, and Divine; for which reason, the angel who announced the same to Mary is called "Gabriel" (<a href="3927/luke_1_19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_26.htm">26-35</a>). They also, who are engaged in those ministries, are named "Michaels" and "Gabriels" in heaven. By "an angel," in the highest sense, is meant the Lord; and, in a relative sense, the heaven of angels, as also an angelic society as may be seen above, (<a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="65.htm">65</a>, <a href="258.htm">258</a>, <a href="342.htm">342</a>, <a href="344.htm">344</a>, <a href="415.htm">415</a>, <a href="465.htm">465</a>); but here, a ministry is signified, because they are mentioned by name; and, in Daniel, Michael is called "a prince;" and by "a prince" in the Word, is signified a principal truth, and by "a king," truth itself, (<a href="20.htm">20</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 548 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>548. (Vers. 7) "Et factum est bellum in Caelo, haec et angeli ejus pugnarunt cum Dracone; et Draco pugnavit et angeli ejus," significat falsa prioris Ecclesiae pugnantia contra vera Novae Ecclesiae. Per "bellum" significatur bellum spirituale, quod est falsi contra verum, ac veri contra falsum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_500" target=_top>500</a>); non enim aliud bellum in Caelo, ubi dicitur exstitisse, potest fieri; nec potest in Caelo semel formato ab Angelis sed factum est in "Caelo priori quod transiit" (de quo <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_1" target=_top>Apocalypsis 21:1</a>); de quo Caelo videatur Explicatio ibi; transiit enim id Caelum per Ultimum Judicium super Draconem et ejus angelos, quod etiam significatur per quod "Draco dejectus sit, et non locus ejus amplius in Caelo in ventus," ut sequitur. Quaenam falsa per "Draconem" intelliguntur, quae pugnatura sunt contra vera Novae Ecclesiae, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_537" target=_top>537</a>). Per "Michaelem" non intelligitur aliquis Archangelus, nec per "Gabrielem" et "Raphaelem," sed intelliguntur Ministeria in Caelo. Ministerium, quod est "Michael" ibi, est apud illos qui ex Verbo confirmant quod Dominus sit Deus Caeli et Terrae, et quod Deus Pater et Ipse unum sint sicut Anima et Corpus unum sunt, tum quod secundum praecepta Decalogi vivendum sit, et quod tunc homini charitas et fides sint. Nominatur "Michael" etiam apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_10_13" target=_top>Danielem 10:13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_10_21" target=_top>21</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_12_1" target=_top>12:1</a>; et per illum simile Ministerium intelligitur, ut patet a cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_9_1-27" target=_top>9</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_10_1-21" target=_top>10</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_11_1-45" target=_top>11</a>; et ab ultimis versibus capitis <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_12_1-13" target=_top>12</a>, ibi. Per "Gabrielem" autem intelligitur Ministerium apud illos qui ex Verbo docent quod Jehovah in mundum venerit, ac quod Humanum quod ibi suscepit sit Filius Dei ac Divinum; quare Angelus qui id annuntiavit Mariae vocatur "Gabriel," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_1_19" target=_top>Luca 1:19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_1_26-35" target=_top>26-35</a>). Nominantur etiam illi qui in Ministeriis illis sunt, "Michaeles" et "Gabrieles," in Caelo. Quod per "Angelum" in supremo Sensu intelligatur Dominus, et in Sensu respectivo Caelum ex Angelis, tum etiam Societas Angelica, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_5" target=_top>5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_65" target=_top>65</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_258" target=_top>258</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_342" target=_top>342</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_344" target=_top>344</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_415" target=_top>415</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_465" target=_top>465</a>); <sup>1</sup>hic autem Ministerium, quia vocantur nomine, et Michael apud Danielem vocatur "Princeps," et per "Principem" in Verbo significatur principale verum, ac per "Regem" ipsum Verum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_548/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_20" target=_top>20</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;65 pro "66" </p>
