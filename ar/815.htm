<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第815节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>815.“这细麻衣就是圣徒的义行”表那些属于主教会的人通过出于圣言的真理而拥有生活的良善。“细麻”表示纯正的真理，也就是通过圣言来自主的真理（<a href="814.htm">814</a>节）。“义行”表示那些处于真理之人的生活良善（<a href="668.htm">668</a>节）。“圣徒”表示那些属于主的教会之人（<a href="173.htm">173</a>，<a href="586.htm">586</a>节）。“义行”是指那些处于真理之人的生活良善，这是因为没有人能被称为义，除非他照真理生活。事实上，就属世之义而言，凡照文明、道德的法律而生活的人都被称为“义”；但就属灵之义而言，只有照神性律法生活的人才被称为“义”，神性律法就是出于圣言的真理。人若自以为义，因而以为处于生活的良善，却没有他所照之生活的真理，就大大受骗了；因为人若不靠着真理和照之的生活，就无法被改造和重生，从而变得良善。由此明显可知，“这细麻衣就是圣徒义行”表示那些属于主教会的人通过出于圣言的真理而拥有生活的良善。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 815</h4><p>815. For the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. This symbolically means that through truths from the Word those who are of the Lord's church live good lives.<p>The fine linen symbolizes genuine truths, which are truths gained through the Word from the Lord, as in no. <a href="814.htm">814</a> just above. Righteous acts symbolize good lives in the case of people governed by truths (no. <a href="668.htm">668</a>). Saints symbolize people who are of the Lord's church (nos. <a href="173.htm">173</a>, <a href="586.htm">586</a>).<p>Righteous acts are the practices of good lives in the case of people governed by truths, because no one can be called righteous unless he lives in accordance with truths. For in the natural sense a righteous person is everyone who lives rightly in accordance with civil and moral laws. But in the spiritual sense that person is called righteous who lives rightly in accordance with Divine laws, and Divine laws are truths from the Word. Someone who believes that he is righteous and so living a good life without living in accordance with truths is much deceived. For a person cannot be reformed and regenerated and so become good, except by means of truths and by a life in accordance with those truths.<p>It is apparent from this that the fine linen's being the righteous acts of the saints means, symbolically, that through truths from the Word those who are of the Lord's church live good lives.<p>This is clearly apparent in the case of angels in heaven. The more they are governed by truths and live in accordance with them, the brighter white the garments in which they appear clothed. That is because they enjoy a brighter light. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 815</h4><p>815. 'For the fine linen [signifies] the just deeds of the saints' signifies that by means of truths out of the Word those who belong to the Lord's Church have the goods of life. By 'the fine linen' are signified genuine truths, which are truths from the Lord by means of the Word, as just above (<a href="814.htm">814</a>). By 'the just deeds' are signified the goods of life with those who are in truths (<a href="668.htm">668</a>). By 'the saints' are signified those who belong to the Lord's Church (<a href="173.htm">173</a>, <a href="586.htm">586</a>). That 'just deeds' are the goods of life with those who are in truths is because no one can be said to be just unless he lives in accordance with truths. For in the natural sense every one who lives well in accordance with civil and moral laws is termed 'just,' but in the spiritual sense he is termed 'just' who lives well in accordance with Divine laws, and Divine laws are truths out of the Word. He who believes himself to be just, consequently in the good of life, without truths according to which he lives is much deceived; for a man cannot be reformed and regenerated, and so become good, except by means of truths and by a life in accordance with them. It is plain from this that by 'the fine linen [signifies] the just deeds of the saints' is signified that by means of truths out of the Word those who belong to the Lord's Church have the goods of life. This is quite plain from the angels of heaven. To the extent that they are in truths and in a life in accordance therewith, to that extent do they appear to be clothed with whiter garments. Thus is because they are in a whiter light. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 815</h4><p>815. For the fine linen is the just deeds of the saints, signifies that through truths from the Word those who are of the Lord's church have the goods of life. By "fine linen" are signified genuine truths, which are truths from the Lord through the Word, as just above, (<a href="814.htm">814</a>). By "just deeds" are signified the goods of life with those who are in truths, (<a href="668.htm">668</a>). By "the saints" are signified those who are of the Lord's church, (<a href="173.htm">173</a>, <a href="586.htm">586</a>). That "just deeds" are the goods of life with those who are in truths, is because no one can be called just, unless he lives according to truths; for in the natural sense everyone is called just who lives well according to the civil and moral laws; but in the spiritual sense he is called "just" who lives well according to the Divine laws, and the Divine laws are truths from the Word. He who believes himself to be just, consequently in the good of life, without the truths according to which he should live, is much deceived; for a man cannot be reformed and regenerated, consequently become good, except by truths, and by life according to them. Hence it is manifest, that by "the fine linen is the just deeds of the saints," is signified that those who are of the Lord's church have the goods of life through truths from the Word. This is plainly manifest from the angels of heaven; the more they are in truths and in life according to them they appear clothed in the brighter garments; the reason is, that they are in brighter light. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 815 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>815. "Nam byssinum justitiae sanctorum," significat quod per vera ex Verbo sint bona vitae illis qui ab Ecclesia Domini sunt. - Per "byssinum" significantur genuina vera, quae sunt vera per Verbum a Domino, ut mox supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_815/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_814" target=_top>814</a>); per "justitias significantur bona vitae apud illos qui in veris sunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_815/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_668" target=_top>668</a>); per "sanctos" significantur qui ab Ecclesia Domini sunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_815/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173" target=_top>173</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_815/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_586" target=_top>586</a>). Quod "justitiae sint bona vitae apud illos qui in veris sunt, est quia nemo potest justus dici, nisi vivat secundum vera; justus enim in naturali Sensu dicitur omnis qui bene vivit secundum leges civiles et morales; at justus in spirituali Sensu dicitur, qui bene vivit secundum leges Divinas, et leges Divinae sunt vera ex Verbo. Qui credit se justum esse, proinde in bono vitae, absque veris secundum quae vivat, multum fallitur; nam homo non potest reformari et regenerari, proinde fieri bonus, nisi per vera, et per vitam secundum illa. Inde patet, quod per "byssinum justitiae sanctorum" significetur quod per vera ex Verbo sint bona vitae illis qui ab Ecclesia Domini sunt. Hoc manifeste patet ab angelis Caeli; illi quo plus in veris sunt, et in vita secundum illa, eo vestibus candidioribus amicti apparent; causa est quia in candidiore luce sunt. </p>
