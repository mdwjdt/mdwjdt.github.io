<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第830节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>830.启19:16.“在祂衣服和大腿上有名写着，万王之王，万主之主”表主在圣言中教导祂的性质，即祂是神性智慧的神性真理，和神性之爱的神性良善，因而祂是宇宙之神。主的“衣服”表示圣言的神性真理，如前所述（<a href="825.htm">825</a>节）。主的“大腿”表示圣言的神性良善。“大腿”和“腰”表示婚姻之爱；由于婚姻之爱是一切爱的基础，故“大腿”和“腰”表示爱的良善。这是由于对应（参看<a href="213.htm">213</a>节）。因此，当“大腿”论及主时，它表示主自己的爱之良善；在此还表示圣言的爱之良善。“有名写着”表示主的性质，如前所述（<a href="824.htm">824</a>节）。“万王之王”是指主的神性智慧的神性真理；“万主之主”是指主的神性之爱的神性良善。主的国度（kingdom）和统治（dominion）一同提及时，所表相同（参看<a href="664.htm">664</a>节）。</p><p>由于经上说“万王之王”和“万主之主”，它们表示主的神性真理和神性良善，故经上还说“在祂衣服和大腿上有名写着”；写在“祂衣服”上的“名”表示圣言的神性真理，写在“祂大腿”上的“名”表示圣言的神性良善。这二者都在圣言中。圣言的神性真理在它的属灵之义中，属灵之义是为了中间或第二层天堂的天使，他们因神性真理而处于聪明；圣言的神性良善在它的属天之义中，属天之义是为了最高层或第三层天堂的天使，他们因神性良善而处于智慧。不过，属天之义隐藏得更深，只有那些从主处于对主之爱的人才能察觉出来。骑在马上的那位就是主，这一点在前面启示录中公开说明了：</p><p>他们与羔羊争战，羔羊必胜过他们，因为祂是万主之主，万王之王。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启 17.14.htm"> 17:14</a>）</p><p>“大腿”和“腰”表示爱之良善，当论及主时，表示神性之爱的神性良善；这一点从圣言中的这些话明显可知：</p><p>公义必当祂的腰带，真理必当祂大腿的带子。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.5.htm">11:5</a>）</p><p>在基路伯的头以上有人在宝座上的形像；从仿佛祂的腰和腰以上，又从仿佛祂的腰和腰以下，好像有火的形像，周围有光辉。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.26.htm">1:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.28.htm">28</a>）</p><p>宝座上的人是指主；“从腰以上和腰以下火的形像”表示祂的神性之爱；“周围的光辉”表示来自神性之爱的神性智慧。</p><p>但以理见有一人腰束乌法精金带。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.5.htm">10:5</a>）</p><p>这人是一位天使，主在他里面；“乌法精金”表示爱之良善。“大腿”所表相同（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.27.htm">5:27</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.3.htm">45:3</a>；等）。关于大腿或腰与婚姻之爱，就是一切爱之基础的对应关系，可参看《天堂的奥秘》（<a href="../ac/5050.htm">5050</a>-<a href="../ac/5062.htm">5062</a>节）一书。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 830</h4><p>830. <a href="3927/revelation_19_16.htm">19:16</a> And He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written: "King of kings and Lord of lords." This symbolically means that the Lord teaches in the Word who He is, that He is the Divine truth of Divine wisdom and the Divine goodness of Divine love, thus that He is God of the universe.<p>The Lord's garment symbolizes the Word in respect to Divine truth, as in no. <a href="825.htm">825</a> above. The Lord's thigh symbolizes the Word in respect to Divine goodness. Because thighs and loins symbolize married love, and because that love is the fundamental love of all loves, therefore thighs and loins symbolize the goodness of love. That this is due to its correspondence may be seen in no. <a href="213.htm">213</a> above. Therefore, when a thigh is mentioned in reference to the Lord, it symbolizes the Lord in respect to the goodness of love, and here the Word as well in that respect. Having a name written symbolizes the character of the Lord, as in no. <a href="824.htm">824</a> above. "King of kings" means the Lord in respect to the Divine truth of His Divine wisdom, and "Lord of lords" means the Lord in respect to the Divine goodness of His Divine love. The Lord's kingdom and His dominion have the same symbolic meaning in places where both are mentioned (see no. <a href="664.htm">664</a> above).</p><p>[2] Because the Lord is called King of kings and Lord of lords, and this means the Lord in respect to both Divine truth and Divine good, therefore the name is said to have been written on His garment and on His thigh; and the name written on His garment symbolizes the Word in respect to Divine truth, while the name written on His thigh symbolizes the Word in respect to Divine goodness, both being contained in the Word. The Word's Divine truth is found in its spiritual sense, which is intended for angels of the intermediate or second heaven, who possess intelligence stemming from Divine truths; and the Word's Divine goodness is found in its celestial sense, which is intended for angels of the highest or third heaven, who possess wisdom stemming from Divine goods. But this latter sense is deeply hidden, being perceptible only to people who possess love toward the Lord from the Lord.<p>That the one on the white horse here is the Lord is explicitly said above in the book of Revelation:<p>These will do battle with the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings. (<a href="3927/revelation_17_14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>)</p><p>[3] That a thigh symbolizes the goodness of love, and in reference to the Lord, the Divine goodness of His Divine love, is clear from the following passages in the Word:<p>Righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins, and truth the girdle of His thighs. (<a href="3927/isaiah_11_5.htm">Isaiah 11:5</a>)<p>...over (the cherubim's) heads was... the appearance of a man (on a throne).... From the appearance of His loins and upward..., and from the appearance of His loins and downward..., (there was) the appearance of fire and of brightness all around. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26-28</a>)<p>The man on the throne means the Lord. The appearance of fire from His loins upward and downward symbolizes His Divine love, and the brightness all around symbolizes the Divine wisdom emanating from it.<p>(Daniel saw a man) whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz. (<a href="3927/daniel_10_5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>)<p>The man was an angel having the Lord in him. Gold of Uphaz symbolizes the goodness of love.<p>The thighs or loins have the same symbolic meaning in <a href="3927/isaiah_5_27.htm">Isaiah 5:27</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_45_3.htm">Psalms 45:3</a>, and elsewhere.<p>Regarding the correspondence of the thighs or loins with married love, which is the fundamental love of all loves, see Arcana Coelestia (The Secrets of Heaven), nos. <a href="../ac/5050.htm">5050-5062</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 830</h4><p>830. [verse 16] 'And upon the garment and upon His thigh He has a Name written, King of kings and Lord of lords' signifies that the Lord teaches in the Word what He is like, that He is the Divine Truth of Divine Wisdom and the Divine Good of Divine Love, thus that He is the God of the universe. By the Lord's 'garment' is signified the Word as to Divine Truth, as above (<a href="825.htm">825</a>). By the Lord's 'thigh' is signified the Word as to Divine Good. The 'thighs' and 'loins' signify conjugial love, and because that love is fundamental to all loves therefore the 'thighs' and 'loins' signify the good of love. That this is the result of correspondence may be seen above (<a href="213.htm">213</a>). Therefore when 'thigh' is said of the Lord it signifies Himself as to the Good of Love, here also the Word as to that. By 'a Name written' is signified what the Lord is like, as above (<a href="824.htm">824</a>). By 'King of kings' is understood the Lord as to the Divine Truth of Divine Wisdom, and by 'Lord of lords' is understood the Lord as to the Divine Good of Divine Love. The like is signified by the Lord's 'kingdom' and 'dominion,' where both are mentioned, as may be seen above (<a href="664.htm">664</a>).</p><p>[2] Because it is said 'King of kings and Lord of lords' and by those [terms] is understood the Lord as to Divine Truth and as to Divine Good, therefore also it is said 'a Name written upon the garment and upon the thigh,' and by the 'Name written upon the garment' is signified the Word as to Divine Truth and by the 'Name written upon the thighs' is signified the Word as to Divine Good. Each of the two is in the Word. The Divine Truth of the Word is in its spiritual sense, which is for the angels of the middle or second heaven who are in intelligence derived from Divine Truths, and the Divine Good of the Word is in its celestial sense, which is for the angels of the highest or third heaven who are in wisdom derived from Divine Goods. But the latter sense is deeply hidden, perceptible only to those who from the Lord are in a love directed to the Lord. That it is the Lord is said above openly in the Apocalypse:<p>These shall fight with the Lamb; the Lamb shall overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings. <a href="3927/revelation_17_14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>.</p><p>[3] That 'the thigh' signifies the good of love, and when [said] of the Lord the Divine Good of Divine Love, is established from these [statements] in the Word:<p>Justice shall be the girdle of His loins, and the Truth (veritas) the girdle of His thighs. <a href="3927/isaiah_11_5.htm">Isaiah 11:5</a>.<p>Above the head of the cherubs was the appearance of the Man upon a throne; from the appearance of His loins and upwards and from the appearance of His loins and downward, was the appearance of fire and brightness round about Ezekiel 26-28.<p>By 'the Man upon a throne' is understood the Lord. By 'the appearance of fire from the loins upward and downward' is signified His Divine Love, and by 'the brightness round about' is signified the Divine Wisdom therefrom. The 'man' seen by Daniel, whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz. <a href="3927/daniel_10_5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>,was an angel in whom the Lord was. By 'gold of Uphaz' is signified the good of love. The like is signified by 'the thighs (<a href="3927/isaiah_5_27.htm">Isaiah 5:27</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_45_3.htm">Psalms 45:3</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_45_4.htm">4</a>]; and elsewhere). Concerning the correspondence of the thighs or loins with conjugial love, which is fundamental to all loves, ARCANA CAELESTIA may be seen (<a href="../ac/5050.htm">Arcana Coelestia 5050-5062</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 830</h4><p>830. Verse 16. And He hath upon His garment and upon his thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords, signifies that the Lord teaches in the Word what He is, that He is the Divine truth of the Divine wisdom and the Divine good of the Divine love, thus that He is the God of the universe. By the Lord's "garment" the Word as to the Divine truth is signified, as above, (<a href="825.htm">825</a>). By the Lord's "thigh" is signified the Word as to Divine good. The "thighs" and "loins" signify conjugial love; and as that love is the fundamental of all loves, therefore "the thighs" and "the loins" signify the good of love. That this is from correspondence may be seen above, (<a href="213.htm">213</a>[1-4]). Therefore when "the thigh" is spoken of in relation to the Lord, it signifies Himself as to the good of love; here also the Word as to the same. By "the name written" the Lord's quality is signified as above, (<a href="824.htm">824</a>). By "King of kings" is meant the Lord as to the Divine truth of the Divine wisdom, and by "Lord of lords" is meant the Lord as to the Divine good of the Divine love. The like is signified by the Lord's kingdom and dominion, where both are mentioned, see above, (<a href="664.htm">664</a>).</p><p>[2] As it is said, "King of kings and Lord of lords," and by them the Lord as to the Divine truth and the Divine good is meant, it is therefore said also, "a name written upon His garment and upon His thigh;" and by "the name written upon His garment" is signified the Word as to the Divine truth, and by "the name written upon His thigh," the Word as to the Divine good. Both are in the Word. The Divine truth of the Word is in its spiritual sense, which is for the angels of the middle or second heaven, who are in intelligence from Divine truths; and the Divine good of the Word in its celestial sense, which is for the angels of the highest or third heaven, who are in wisdom from Divine goods. But the latter sense is deeply hidden, perceptible to those only who are in love to the Lord from the Lord. That it is the Lord, is openly said above in Revelation:<p>They shall fight with the Lamb; the Lamb shall overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings, (<a href="3927/revelation_17_14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>).</p><p>[3] That "the thigh" signifies the good of love, and when speaking of the Lord, the Divine good of the Divine love, is evident from these passages in the Word:<p>Justice shall be the girdle of His loins, and truth the girdle of His thighs, (<a href="3927/isaiah_11_5.htm">Isaiah 11:5</a>).<p>Over the head of the cherubim was the appearance of a Man upon a throne; from the appearance of His loins and upward, and from the appearance of His loins downward, was the appearance of fire and brightness round about, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26-28</a>).<p>By the "Man upon the throne" is meant the Lord; by "the appearance of fire from the loins upward and downward" His Divine love is signified; and by "the brightness round about" is signified the Divine wisdom therefrom.<p>The Man seen by Daniel, whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz, (<a href="3927/daniel_10_5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>)<p>was an angel in whom was the Lord; by "the gold of Uphaz" the good of love is signified. The like is signified by "the thigh" (<a href="3927/isaiah_5_27.htm">Isaiah 5:27</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_45_3.htm">Psalms 45:3</a> and elsewhere). Concerning the correspondence of the thighs or loins with conjugial love, which is the fundamental of all loves, see the Arcana Coelestia, (<a href="../ac/5050.htm">5050-5062</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 830 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>830. (Vere. 16.) "Et habet super vestimento et super femore Suo Nomen scriptum, Rex regum et Dominus dominorum," significat quod Dominus doceat in Verbo qualis est, quod sit Divinum Verum Divinae Sapientiae et Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris, ita quod sit Deus Universi. - Per "vestimentum" Domini significatur Verbum quoad Divinum Verum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_830/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_825" target=_top>825</a>); <sup>1</sup>per "femur" Domini significatur Verbum quoad Divinum Bonum; quod "femora" et "lumbi" significent Amorem conjugialem (et quia ille Amor est fundamentalis omnium amorum, ideo "femora" et "lumbi" significant bonum amoris), (et) quod hoc sit ex correspondentia, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_830/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_213" target=_top>213</a>); ideo cum "femur" dicitur de Domino, significatur Ipse quoad Bonum Amoris, hic etiam Verbum quoad illud: per "Nomen scriptum" significatur quale Domini, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_830/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_824" target=_top>824</a>); <sup>2</sup>per "Regem regum, intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum Divinae Sapientiae, et per "Dominum dominorum" intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris; simile significatur per Regnum et per Dominium Domini, ubi utrumque dicitur, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_830/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_664" target=_top>664</a>). Quia dicitur "Rex regum et Dominus dominorum," et per illa intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum et quoad Divinum Bonum, ideo etiam dicitur "Nomen scriptum super vestimento et super femore;" et per "Nomen scriptum super vestimento" significatur Verbum quoad Divinum Verum, et per "Nomen scriptum super femore" significatur Verbum quoad Divinum Bonum. Utrumque est in Verbo: Divinum Verum Verbi est in Sensu spirituali ejus, qui est pro angelis medii seu secundi Caeli, qui in intelligentia sunt ex Divinis Veris, et Divinum Bonum Verbi est in Sensu caelesti ejus, qui est pro angelis supremi seu tertii Caeli, qui in sapientia sunt ex Divinis Bonis; sed hic Sensus est occultissimus, solum perceptibilis illis qui in amore in Dominum a Domino sunt Quod sit Dominus, aperte dicitur supra in Apocalypsi: <p>"Illi cum Agno pugnabunt, (sed) Agnus vincet illos, quia est Dominus dominorum et Rex regum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_830/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_17_14" target=_top>17:14</a>).<p>Quod "femur" significet bonum amoris, et cum de Domino Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris, constat ex his in Verbo: <p>"Erit Justitia cingulum Lumborum Ipsius, et Veritas cingulum Feminum Ipsius," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_830/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_11_5" target=_top>Esaias 11:5</a>);<p>Super capite Cheruborum "erat aspectus Hominis super Throno; ab aspectu Lumborum Ipsius et sursum, et ab aspectu Lumborum Ipsius et deorsum, erat aspectus ignis et splendoris circumcirca," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_830/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_1_26-28" target=_top>Ezechiel 1:26-28</a>);<p>per "Hominem super Throno" intelligitur Dominus, per "aspectum ignis a lumbis sursum et deorsum" significatur Divinus Ipsius Amor, et per "splendorem circumcirca" significatur Divina Sapientia inde.
