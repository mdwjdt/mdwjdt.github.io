<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第669节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>669.启15:5.“这些事以后，我观看，见在天上那存法版帐幕的殿开了”表天堂的至内层被看到了，在那里主居于其圣言的神圣，以及律法，也就是十诫中。“殿”在至高意义上表示主的神性人，因而表示天堂和教会（<a href="191.htm">191</a>，<a href="529.htm">529</a>节），在此表示基督天堂。“法版帐幕”（tabernacle of the testimony）表示该天堂的至内层，在那里主居于圣言的神圣，以及律法，也就是十诫中；因为“帐幕”（或会幕）同样表示天堂（<a href="585.htm">585</a>节），帐幕或会幕的至内层就是约柜所在之处，约柜中有两块石版，上面是神用手指所写的十句话，也就是“法版”（testimony）所表示，也被称为“见证”（testimony）的十诫；由此明显可知，“我观看，见在天上那存法版帐幕的殿开了”表天堂的至内层被看到了，在那里主居于其神圣，以及律法，也就是十诫中。“法版帐幕”也表示圣言所在之处，因为所提及的“法版或见证”（testimony）不仅涉及律法，也就是十诫，还涉及圣言，涉及作为圣言的主，因为圣言为主作见证（<a href="490.htm">490</a>，<a href="555.htm">555</a>节）。</p><p>圣言在天上，被存放于天上被称为神圣宝库的至内在部分，那里的光火红明亮，胜过外面在天上其它部分所闪耀的各种程度的光，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/70.htm">70</a>-75节），关于这神圣宝库（参看该书<a href="../ss/73.htm">73</a>节）。关于律法，也就是十诫的神圣，可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》（<a href="../life/53.htm">53</a>-60节）中十诫的相关内容。关于盛有十诫两块石版的约柜构成耶路撒冷圣殿、因而会幕的至圣所或至内在部分，可参看列王纪上（<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上61.9.htm">61:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上61.28.htm">28</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上8.3.htm">8:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上8.9.htm">9</a>）。律法，也就是十诫被称为“法版”（或见证），这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>摩西下来，手里拿着两块法版；这版是神的工作；字是神写的，刻在版上。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.15.htm">32:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.16.htm">16</a>）</p><p>两块法版，就是神用指头写的石版。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.18.htm">31:18</a>）</p><p>耶和华说，你要将我所要赐给你的法版放在柜里。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.16.htm">25:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.22.htm">22</a>）</p><p>摩西取来法版，放在柜里。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.20.htm">40:20</a>）</p><p>香的烟云遮掩法版上的施恩座。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.13.htm">16:13</a>）</p><p>耶和华对摩西说，把这些杖存在法版前，后来把亚伦的杖放在法版前。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民17.4.htm">17:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民17.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>摩西就把杖存在法版的帐幕内，在耶和华面前。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民17.7.htm">17:7</a>）</p><p>约柜被称为法柜（ark of the testimony）。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.7.htm">31:7</a>）</p><p>帐幕被称为法版的居所。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出38.21.htm">38:21</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 669</h4><p>669. <a href="3927/revelation_15_5.htm">15:5</a> After these things I looked, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened. This symbolically means that the inmost of heaven appeared, where the Lord is present in His holiness in the Word and in the Law contained in the Ten Commandments.<p>In the highest sense, the temple symbolizes the Lord in respect to His Divine humanity, and consequently heaven and the church (nos. <a href="191.htm">191</a>, <a href="529.htm">529</a>), here the Christian heaven. The tabernacle of the testimony symbolizes the inmost of that heaven, where the Lord resides in His holiness in the Word and in the Law contained in the Ten Commandments, since the Tabernacle likewise symbolizes heaven (no. <a href="585.htm">585</a>); and the inmost of the Tabernacle was where the Ark was placed, containing the two tablets on which were written by the finger of God the ten precepts that constitute the ten commandments of the Decalogue, which are meant by the testimony here and are also called the Testimony. And it is apparent from this that John's saying, "I looked, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened," means symbolically that the inmost of heaven appeared, where the Lord is present in His holiness in the Law contained in the Ten Commandments.<p>The tabernacle of the testimony symbolizes also where the Word exists because the term "testimony" is used not only of the Law contained in the Ten Commandments, but of the whole Word as well, and of the Lord as the embodiment of the Word, because the Word testifies concerning Him (nos. <a href="490.htm">490</a>, <a href="555.htm">555</a>).</p><p>[2] That the Word exists in heaven, in a repository in the inmost of heaven called a sanctuary, and that the light there is blazing and brilliant, surpassing in intensity any light in heaven outside that sanctuary, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="../ss/70.htm">70-75</a>. And with respect to the sanctuary, no. <a href="../ss/73.htm">73</a> there.<p>Regarding the holiness of the Law contained in the Ten Commandments, see The Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem in Accordance With the Commandments of the Decalogue, nos. <a href="53.htm">53-61</a>.<p>To be shown that the Ark containing the two tablets of the Decalogue constituted the sanctuary or inmost of the Temple in Jerusalem, and so the tabernacle there, see <a href="3927/1-kings_6_19.htm">1 Kings 6:19-28</a>; <a href="3927/1-kings_8_3.htm">8:3-9</a>.<p>That the Law contained in the Ten Commandments was called the Testimony is clear from the following passages:<p>Moses... went down..., and the two tablets of the Testimony were in his hand... The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets. (<a href="3927/exodus_32_15.htm">Exodus 32:15-16</a>)<p>...two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God. (<a href="3927/exodus_31_18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>)<p>(Jehovah said,) "You shall put into the ark the Testimony which I will give you." (<a href="3927/exodus_25_16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_25_21.htm">21-22</a>)<p>Then (Moses) took the Testimony and put it into the ark... (<a href="3927/exodus_40_20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>)<p>...that the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the Testimony... (<a href="3927/leviticus_16_13.htm">Leviticus 16:13</a>)<p>(Jehovah said to Moses,) "You shall place (the rods)...before the Testimony... And... Aaron's rod before the Testimony...." (<a href="3927/numbers_17_4.htm">Numbers 17:4</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_17_10.htm">10</a>)<p>And Moses left the rods before Jehovah... (<a href="3927/numbers_17_7.htm">Numbers 17:7</a>)<p>The Ark is called the Ark of testimony in <a href="3927/exodus_31_7.htm">Exodus 31:7</a>, and the Tabernacle is called the Tabernacle of the Testimony in <a href="3927/exodus_38_21.htm">Exodus 38:21</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 669</h4><p>669. [verse 5] 'After these things I saw, and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened' signifies that the inmost of heaven was seen, where the Lord is in His holiness in the Word, and in the Law which is the Decalogue. By 'the temple' is signified, in the highest sense, the Lord as to His Divine Human, and heaven and the Church thence (<a href="191.htm">191</a>, <a href="529.htm">529</a>), here the Christian heaven. By 'the tabernacle of the testimony' is signified the inmost of that heaven, where the Lord is in His holiness in the Word, and in the Law which is the Decalogue, inasmuch as by 'the tabernacle' likewise heaven is signified (<a href="585.htm">585</a>), and the inmost of the tabernacle was where the ark was, in which were the two tables on which the 'ten words' were written with the finger of God, which are the ten precepts of the Decalogue. These are understood by 'the testimony,' and are also called the testimony.' From these considerations it is plain that by I saw and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened' is Signified that the inmost of the heaven was seen, where the Lord is in His holiness in the Law which is the Decalogue. By 'the tabernacle of the testimony' is also signified where the Word is, because 'the testimony' is said not only of the Law which is the Decalogue, but also of the Word, and of the Lord as the Word because the Word testifies of Him (<a href="490.htm">490</a>, <a href="555.htm">555</a>).</p><p>[2] That the Word is in heaven, and this is preserved in the inmost thereof, which is called the shrine (sacrarium), and that there is a flaming and dazzling light exceeding every degree of the light that is in the heaven outside it, may be seen in <a href="../ss/70.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 70-75</a>, also concerning that shrine (<a href="73.htm">73</a> there). Concerning the holiness of the Law which is the Decalogue, THE DOCTRINE OF LIFE FOR THE NEW JERUSALEM DERIVED FROM THE PRECEPTS OF THE DECALOGUE may be seen (<a href="../life/53.htm">53-60</a>). It may be seen (<a href="3927/1-kings_6_19.htm">1 Kings 6:19-28</a>; <a href="3927/1-kings_8_4.htm">8:4-10</a>) that:<p>The ark, in which were the two tables of the Decalogue, made the sanctuary or inmost of the Jerusalem temple, and thus the tabernacle there. That the Law which is the Decalogue was termed 'the testimony' is established from these places:<p>Moses went down, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand; the tables were the work of God, the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables, <a href="3927/exodus_32_15.htm">Exodus 32:15-16</a>.<p>Two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God, <a href="3927/exodus_31_18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>.<p>Jehovah said, Thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee, <a href="3927/exodus_25_16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_25_21.htm">21-22</a>.<p>And Moses took and put the testimony into the ark, <a href="3927/exodus_40_20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>.<p>That the cloud of incense may cover the propitiatory that is upon the testimony. <a href="3927/leviticus_16_13.htm">Leviticus 16:13</a>.<p>Jehovah said unto Moses, Leave the rods before the testimony, and Aaron's rod afterwards before the testimony. <a href="3927/numbers_17_4.htm">Numbers 17:4</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_17_10.htm">10</a> [H.B. 19, 25].<p>And Moses left the rods before Jehovah. <a href="3927/numbers_17_7.htm">Numbers 17:7</a>; [H.B. 22].<p>The ark is called the ark of the testimony, <a href="3927/exodus_31_7.htm">Exodus 31:7</a>.<p>And the tabernacle is called the habitation of the testimony, <a href="3927/exodus_38_21.htm">Exodus 38:21</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 669</h4><p>669. Verse 5. After these things I saw, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened, signifies that the inmost of heaven was seen, where the Lord is in His holiness in the Word, and in the Law, which is the Decalogue.

"The tabernacle of the testimony" also signifies where the Word is, because "the testimony" is mentioned not only in relation to the Law, which is the Decalogue, but also to the Word, and to the Lord as the Word, because the Word testifies of Him, (<a href="490.htm">490</a>, <a href="555.htm">555</a>).</p><p>[2] That the Word is in heaven, and is deposited in the inmost part thereof, which is called the sacred repository, and that the light there is flaming and bright, exceeding every degree of light that shines without in the other parts of heaven, may be seen in the <a href="../ss/70.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture 70-75</a>, and concerning that sacred repository <a href="../ss/73.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture 73</a>.
