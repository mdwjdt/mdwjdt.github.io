<p>173.“这些事那圣洁、真实的说的”表主的神性真理。很明显，这是指主；“那圣洁、真实的”之所以指主的神性真理，是因为主凭其神性真理而称为“圣”，凭其神性良善而称为“义”。因此，祂的神性发出，也就是神性真理，被称为“圣灵”，此处“那圣洁、真实的”正是指圣灵。</p><p>“神圣或圣洁”（holy）经常出现在圣言中，无论何处，都与真理有关。由于一切本为真理的真理皆来自良善，来自主，故那被称为“神圣或圣洁”的，正是真理；而真理所来自的良善则被称为“公义”（just）。正因如此，处于智慧之真理、被称为属灵的天使可以说是“神圣或圣洁”的，教会中人也一样。也正因如此，先知和使徒被称为“神圣或圣洁”，因为“先知”和“使徒”表示教会教义的真理。由于同样的原因，圣言也被称为“神圣或圣洁”，因为圣言是神性真理；会幕约柜内的律法也被称为“至圣所”和“圣所”。耶路撒冷以同样的方式被称为“神圣或圣洁”，因为“耶路撒冷”表示处于神性真理的教会。所以，祭坛、会幕、亚伦和他儿子的法衣抹油以后同样被称为“神圣或圣洁”，因为“油”表爱之良善，它使事物成圣，凡成圣之物都和真理有关。</p><p>唯独主是神圣的，因为祂是神性真理本身。这从以下经文明显可知：</p><p>主啊，谁不荣耀你名，因为独有你是圣的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.4.htm">15:4</a>）</p><p>救赎你的是以色列的圣者，祂必称为全地之神。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.5.htm">54:5</a>）</p><p>救赎主以色列的圣者耶和华如此说。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.7.htm">49:7</a>）</p><p>我们救赎主的名是万军之耶和华，以色列的圣者。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.4.htm">47:4</a>）</p><p>耶和华你们的救赎主，以色列的圣者如此说。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.14.htm">43:14</a>）</p><p>到那日，他们要诚实倚靠耶和华以色列的圣者。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.20.htm">10:20</a>）</p><p>此外还有其它经文（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.4.htm">1:4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.19.htm">5:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛12.6.htm">12:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛17.7.htm">17:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.19.htm">29:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.11.htm">30:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.12.htm">12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.16.htm">41:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.11.htm">45:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.17.htm">48:17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.5.htm">55:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.9.htm">60:9</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.29.htm">50:29</a>；但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但4.13.htm">4:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但4.23.htm">23</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.41.htm">78:41</a>）。由于主是神圣或圣洁本身，故天使对马利亚说：</p><p>你所要生的圣者必称为神的儿子。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.35.htm">1:35</a>）</p><p>主也论到自己说：</p><p>父啊，求你用真理使他们成圣。你的道就是真理；我为他们的缘故，自己分别为圣，叫他们也因真理成圣。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.17.htm">17:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.19.htm">19</a>）</p><p>由此明显可知，来自主的真理就是神圣本身，因为唯独祂是神圣的。对此，主说：</p><p>只等真理的圣灵来了，祂要引导你们进入一切的真理；因为祂不是凭着自己说的，祂要将受于我的告诉你们。（约翰福音16: 13-15）</p><p>保惠师，就是圣灵，祂要将一切的事，指教你们。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.26.htm">14:26</a>）</p><p>“圣灵”是指主的智慧，因而是指神性真理，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》（<a href="../lord/51.htm">51</a>节）一书。由此明显可知，“那圣洁、真实的”表主的神性真理。至于“圣”论及真理，“义”论及良善，这从圣言中提及这二者的经文明显可知，如以下经文：</p><p>为义的，叫他仍旧为义。圣洁的，叫他仍旧圣洁。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.11.htm">22:11</a>）</p><p>万圣之王啊，你的道路又公义又真实！（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.3.htm">15:3</a>）</p><p>用圣洁公义侍奉祂。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.75.htm">1:75</a>）</p><p>希律敬畏约翰，知道他是义人，是圣人。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可6.20.htm">6:20</a>）</p><p>这细麻衣就是圣徒的公义。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.8.htm">19:8</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 173</h4><p>173. "'These things says He who is holy, who is true.'" This symbolically means the Lord in relation to Divine truth.<p>Clearly it means the Lord. He who is holy, who is true, is the Lord in relation to Divine truth, because the Lord is called holy owing to His Divine truth, and called just or righteous owing to His Divine goodness. It is in consequence of this that His emanating Divinity - which is Divine truth - is called the Holy Spirit; and here the Holy Spirit is He who is holy, who is true.</p><p>[2] Holiness is often mentioned in the Word, and it is everywhere predicated of truth; and because all truth that is true in itself originates from goodness and from the Lord, it is that truth that is called holy. In contrast, the goodness from which truth originates is called just or righteous. It is owing to this that angels governed by truths of wisdom, called spiritual angels, are termed holy, while angels governed by the goodness of love, called celestial angels, are termed just or righteous. The same is the case with people in the church.<p>It is because of this also that prophets and apostles are called saints, or holy, for prophets and apostles symbolize the church's doctrinal truths.<p>It is because of this, too, that the Word is called holy, for the Word is Divine truth. That is why the Law in the ark in the Tabernacle was called the most holy place and also the sanctuary.<p>That, too, is why Jerusalem is called holy, for Jerusalem symbolizes a church which possesses Divine truths.<p>For the same reason the altar, the Tabernacle, and the garments of Aaron and his sons were called holy after they were anointed with oil; for oil symbolizes the goodness of love, and this sanctifies or makes a thing holy, and everything made holy relates to truth.</p><p>[3] From the following passages it is apparent that the Lord alone is holy, because He is Divine truth itself:<p>Who shall not... O Lord..., glorify Your name? For You alone are holy. (<a href="3927/revelation_15_4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>)<p>...your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, the God of the whole earth shall He be called. (<a href="3927/isaiah_54_5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>)<p>Thus said Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One... (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_7.htm">Isaiah 49:7</a>)<p>As for our Redeemer, Jehovah of Hosts is His name, the Holy One of Israel. (<a href="3927/isaiah_47_4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a>)<p>Thus said Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel... (<a href="3927/isaiah_43_14.htm">Isaiah 43:14</a>)<p>...in that day... they will depend on Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. (<a href="3927/isaiah_10_20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>)<p>And also elsewhere, as <a href="3927/isaiah_1_4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_5_19.htm">5:19</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_12_6.htm">12:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_17_7.htm">17:7</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_29_19.htm">29:19</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_30_11.htm">30:11-12</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_41_16.htm">41:16</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_45_11.htm">45:11</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_45_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_48_17.htm">48:17</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_55_5.htm">55:5</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_60_9.htm">60:9</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_4_13.htm">Daniel 4:13</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_4_23.htm">23</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_78_41.htm">Psalms 78:41</a>.<p>Since the Lord is holiness itself, therefore the angel said to Mary,<p>...the holy thing that will be born of you shall be called the Son of God. (<a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>)<p>And regarding Himself the Lord said,<p>(Father,) sanctify them with the truth. Your word is truth... ...for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified with truth. (<a href="3927/john_17_17.htm">John 17:17</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_19.htm">19</a>)</p><p>[4] It is apparent from this that the truth that comes from the Lord is holiness itself, because He alone is holy - concerning which the Lord says the following:<p>When... the Spirit of Truth has come, He will guide you into all truth. ...He will not speak on His own... ...He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you. (<a href="3927/john_16_13.htm">John 16:13-15</a>)<p>The Counselor, the Holy Spirit..., He will teach you all things... (<a href="3927/john_14_26.htm">John 14:26</a>)<p>To be shown that the Holy Spirit is the life in the Lord's wisdom, thus Divine truth, see <a href="../lord/51.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord 51</a>.<p>It can be seen from this that He who is holy, who is true, is the Lord in relation to Divine truth.<p>That holiness is predicated of truth, and justice or righteousness of goodness, is apparent from passages in the Word where the two are mentioned, as in the following:<p>He who is just, let him be just still; he who is holy, let him be holy still. (<a href="3927/revelation_22_11.htm">Revelation 22:11</a>)<p>Just and true are Your ways, O King of saints! (<a href="3927/revelation_15_3.htm">Revelation 15:3</a>)<p>...to serve Him, in holiness and righteousness. (<a href="3927/luke_1_75.htm">Luke 1:75</a>)<p>...Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man... (<a href="3927/mark_6_20.htm">Mark 6:20</a>)<p>...the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. (<a href="3927/revelation_19_8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 173</h4><p>173. 'These things says the Holy True One' signifies the Lord as to Divine Truth. That it is the Lord is plain. 'The Holy True One' is the Lord as to Divine Truth. This is because the Lord is called 'Holy' on account of His Divine Truth, and 'Just' on account of His Divine Good. This is why His Divine proceeding, which is the Divine Truth (veritas), is termed 'the Holy Spirit,' and the Holy Spirit here is 'the Holy True One.</p><p>[2] 'Holy' is frequently said in the Word, and wherever it occurs it is said of Truth, and because every truth that in itself is truth is derived out of good and is from the Lord, it is that truth that is called 'Holy.' But the Good out of which is truth, is called 'Just.' Consequently the angels who are in truths of wisdom and are called spiritual are termed 'holy,' and the angels who are in the good of love and are called celestial are termed 'just'; in like manner men in the Church. It is from this also that the prophets and the apostles are termed 'holy,' for by the prophets and the apostles the truths of the Doctrine of the Church are signified. Furthermore it is from this that the Word is termed 'holy,' for the Word is Divine Truth; and again, that the Law in the ark in the tabernacle was termed 'the holy of holies,' and also 'the sanctuary.' Likewise from this, Jerusalem is termed 'holy,' for by 'Jerusalem' is signified the Church that is in Divine truths. It is in consequence of this also that the altar, the tabernacle, and the garments of Aaron and his sons were said to be 'holy' after they had been anointed with oil, for 'oil' signifies the good of love, and this makes holy, and everything made holy has relation to truth.</p><p>[3] That the Lord is the Only Holy One, because He is the Divine Truth Itself is plain from these passages:<p>Who shall not glorify Thy Name, O Lord? for only Thou art Holy. <a href="3927/revelation_15_4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>.<p>Thy Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, the God of the whole earth shall He be called. <a href="3927/isaiah_54_5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>.<p>Thus says Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One. <a href="3927/isaiah_49_7.htm">Isaiah 49:7</a>.<p>As for our Redeemer, Jehovah Zebaoth is His Name, the Holy One of Israel. <a href="3927/isaiah_47_4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a>.<p>Thus says Jehovah your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. <a href="3927/isaiah_43_14.htm">Isaiah 43:14</a>.<p>In that day they shall lean upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in the truth (veritas). <a href="3927/isaiah_10_20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>.<p>Besides elsewhere, as <a href="3927/isaiah_1_4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_5_19.htm">5:19</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_12_6.htm">12:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_17_7.htm">17:7</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_29_19.htm">29:19</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_30_11.htm">30:11-12</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_41_16.htm">41:16</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_45_11.htm">45:11</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_45_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_48_17.htm">48:17</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_55_5.htm">55:5</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_60_9.htm">60:9</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_4_13.htm">Daniel 4:13</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_4_23.htm">23</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/daniel_4_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_4_20.htm">20</a>]; <a href="3927/psalms_78_41.htm">Psalms 78:41</a>.

From these things it can be established that 'the Holy True One' is the Lord as to Divine Truth. That 'holy' is said of truth, while 'just' is said of good, is plain from the passages in the Word where both [expressions occur], as from these:<p>He who is just, let him be justified still, he who is holy, let him be sanctified still. <a href="3927/revelation_22_11.htm">Revelation 22:11</a>.<p>Just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints, <a href="3927/revelation_15_1.htm">Revelation 15</a>.<p>For the purpose of serving Him in holiness and justice. <a href="3927/luke_1_75.htm">Luke 1:75</a>.<p>Herod was afraid of John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, <a href="3927/mark_6_20.htm">Mark 6:20</a>.<p>The just [acts] of saints are fine linen. <a href="3927/revelation_19_8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 173</h4><p>173. These things saith He that is holy, He that is true, signifies the Lord as to the Divine truth. That it is the Lord, is evident; the reason why "He that is holy, He that is true," is the Lord as to the Divine truth, is because the Lord is called "holy" from His Divine truth, and "just" from His Divine good; hence it is, that His Divine proceeding, which is the Divine truth, is called "the Holy Spirit," and the Holy Spirit here is "He that is holy, He that is true."</p><p>[2] "Holy" often occurs in the Word, and everywhere relates to truth, and as all truth, which in itself is truth, is from good, and is from the Lord, it is that truth which is called holy; but good from which the truth is, is called just. Hence it is, that the angels who are in the truths of wisdom, and are called spiritual, are said to be "holy," and the angels who are in the good of love, and are called celestial, are said to be "just;" in like manner men in the church. It is also from this, that the prophets and apostles are called "holy," for by "the prophets" and "apostles," are signified the truths of doctrine of the church. For the same reason also the Word is called holy, for the Word is the Divine truth; the law in the ark in the tabernacle was also called the Holy of Holies, and also "the Sanctuary." In like manner Jerusalem is called holy, for by "Jerusalem" is signified the church, which is in Divine truths. So likewise the altar, the tabernacle, and the garments of Aaron and his sons were called holy after they were anointed with oil, for oil signifies the good of love, and this sanctifies, and everything sanctified has relation to truth.</p><p>[3] That the Lord alone is holy, because He is the Divine truth itself, is evident from the following passages:<p>Who shall not glorify Thy name, O Lord, for Thou only art holy, (<a href="3927/revelation_15_4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>).<p>Thy Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, the God of the whole earth shall He be called, (<a href="3927/isaiah_54_5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>).<p>Thus saith Jehovah the Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_7.htm">Isaiah 49:7</a>).<p>As for our Redeemer, Jehovah of Hosts is His name, the Holy One of Israel, (<a href="3927/isaiah_47_4.htm">Isaiah 47:4</a>).<p>Thus saith Jehovah your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, (<a href="3927/isaiah_43_14.htm">Isaiah 43:14</a>).<p>In that day they shall lean upon Jehovah the Holy One of Israel in truth, (<a href="3927/isaiah_10_20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>).<p>Besides other places;<a href="3927/isaiah_1_4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_5_19.htm">5:19</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_12_6.htm">12:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_17_7.htm">17:7</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_29_19.htm">29:19</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_30_11.htm">30:11-12</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_41_16.htm">41:16</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_45_11.htm">45:11</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_45_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_48_17.htm">48:17</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_55_5.htm">55:5</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_60_9.htm">60:9</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_4_13.htm">Daniel 4:13</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_4_23.htm">23</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_78_41.htm">Psalms 78:41</a>.

"Haec dicit Sanctus Verus," significat Dominum quoad Divinum Verum. - Quod sit Dominus, patet; quod "Sanctus Verus" sit Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, est quia Dominus vocatur "Sanctus" ex Divino Suo Vero, et "Justus" ex Divino Suo Bono; inde est quod Divinum Ipsius procedens, quod est Divina Veritas, dicatur "Spiritus Sanctus," ac Spiritus Sanctus hic est "Sanctus Verus." In Verbo saepius dicitur "Sanctum," et ubivis de Vero; et quia omne Verum, quod in se verum est, est ex Bono et a Domino, est id Verum quod Sanctum vocatur; at Bonum, ex quo est Verum, vocatur Justum; inde est, quod Angeli qui in veris sapientiae sunt et vocantur spirituales, dicantur "Sancti," et Angeli qui in bono amoris sunt, et vocantur caelestes, dicantur "Justi;" similiter homines in Ecclesia. Inde quoque est, quod Prophetae et Apostoli dicantur "Sancti," per "Prophetas" enim et "Apostolos" significantur vera Doctrinae Ecclesiae. Inde etiam est, quod Verbum dicatur Sanctum, Verbum enim est Divinum Verum; tum quod Lex in arca in Tabernaculo, dicta sit Sanctum sanctorum, et quoque Sanctuarium. Inde etiam est, quod Hierosolyma dicatur sancta, per "Hierosolymam" enim significatur Ecclesia quae in Divinis veris est. Inde etiam est quod Altare, Tabernaculum, Vestes Aharonis et filiorum ejus, dicta fuerint sancta postquam uncta fuerunt oleo, oleum enim significat bonum amoris, et hoc sanctificat, et omne sanctificatum se refert ad verum. Quod Dominus sit Solus Sanctus quia est Ipsum Divinum Verum, patet ex his: <p>"Quis non glorificet Nomen Tuum, Domine, quia es Solus Sanctus' (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_15_4" target=_top>Apocalypsis 15:4</a>);<p>"Redemptor tuus Sanctus Israelis, Deus totius terrae vocabitur," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_54_5" target=_top>Esaias 54:5</a>);<p>"Sic dixit Jehovah, Redemptor Israelis, Sanctus Ipsius," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_49_7" target=_top>Esaias 49:7</a>);<p>"Quod ad Redemptorem nostrum, Jehovah Zebaoth Nomen Ipsius, Sanctus Israelis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_47_4" target=_top>Esaias 47:4</a>);<p>"Dixit Jehovah, Redemptor vester, Sanctus Israelis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_43_14" target=_top>Esaias 43:14</a>);<p>"In die illo innitentur Jehovae Sancto Israelis, in veritate," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_10_20" target=_top>Esaias 10:20</a>).<p>(Praeter alibi, ut <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_4_1-6" target=_top>Esaias 4</a>;

<sup>3</sup><p>ex his patet, quod Veritas quae a Domino est, sit ipsa Sanctitas, quia Ipse est Solus Sanctus; de quo ita Dominus: <p>"Quando venerit Spiritus Veritatis, ducet vos in omnem veritatem; non loquetur ex Se Ipso, ex Meo accipiet et annuntiabit vobis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_16_13-15" target=_top>Johannes 16:13-15</a>);<p>"Paracletus Spiritus Sanctus, ille vos docebit omnia," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_26" target=_top>Johannes 14:26</a>);<p>quod "Spiritus Sanctus" sit Vita Sapientiae Domini, ita Divina Veritas, in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_51" target=_top>51</a>) videatur. Ex his constare potest, quod "Sanctus Verus" sit Dominus quoad Divinum Verum. Quod "Sanctum" dicatur de Vero, ac "Justum" de Bono, patet ex locis in Verbo ubi utrumque dicitur; ut ex his: <p>"Qui Justus est justificetur adhuc, qui Sanctus est sanctificetur adhuc," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_22_11" target=_top>Apocalypsis 22:11</a>);<p>"Justae et Verae sunt viae Tuae, Rex Sanctorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_15_3" target=_top>Apocalypsis 15:3</a>); "Ad serviendum Ipsi in Sanctitate et Justitia," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_1_1-80" target=_top>Luca 1</a>:(<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_1_74" target=_top>74</a>,) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_1_75" target=_top>75</a>);<p>"Herodes timebat Johannem, sciens quod esset vir Justus et Sanctus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_6_20" target=_top>Marcus 6:20</a>);<p>"Byssinum sunt Justitiae Sanctorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_19_8" target=_top>Apocalypsis 19:8</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;xlv. pro "xliv."<p>2.&nbsp;l. pro "i."<p>3.&nbsp;xvii. pro "xviii." </p>
