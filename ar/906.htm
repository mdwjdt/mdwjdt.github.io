<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第906节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>906.“长宽一样大”表在新教会，良善与真理如本质与形式那样合而为一。耶路撒冷城的“长”表示教会的良善，它的“宽”表示教会的真理；“宽”表示真理，这从圣言可以说明，如前所述（<a href="861.htm">861</a>节）。“长”表示良善，在此表示教会良善的原因和“宽”表示真理的原因是一样的；原因在于此：天堂从东向西的延伸以“长”来表示，从南向北的延伸以“宽”来表示；处于爱之良善的天使居住在天堂的东边和西边，处于智慧之真理的天使居住在天堂的南边和北边（参看<a href="901.htm">901</a>节）。</p><p>地上的教会也是如此，因为处于来自圣言的教会良善与真理的每个人皆与天上的天使相联系，就其心智的内层而言，与这些天使住在一起；凡处于爱之良善的，都住在天堂的东边和西边；凡处于智慧之真理的，都住在天堂的南边和北边。事实上，人对此并不知情，然而每个人死后都会进入自己的地方。正因如此，</p><p>当论及教会时，“长”表示它的良善，“宽”表示它的真理；显然，长和宽不可能论及教会，只能论及一座城，而城表示教会。这句话之所以表示在新教会，良善与真理如本质与形式那样合而为一，是因为经上说“长宽一样大”，“长”表示教会的良善，“宽”表示教会的真理，如前所述；它们之所以如本质与形式那样合而为—，是因为真理是良善的形式，良善是真理的本质，而本质与形式则合而为一。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 906</h4><p>906. Its length is as great as its breadth. This symbolically means that goodness and truth in the New Church are united, like essence and form.<p>The length of the city Jerusalem symbolizes the church's goodness, and its breadth symbolizes the church's truth. That the breadth of a thing symbolizes truth is something we showed from the Word in no. <a href="861.htm">861</a> above.<p>The length of a thing symbolizes goodness, here the goodness of the church, for the same reason that breadth symbolizes truth. The reason is that the sweep of heaven from east to west is meant by length, and the sweep of heaven from south to north by breadth, and angels who dwell in the eastern and western zones in heaven are impelled by the goodness of love, while angels who dwell in the southern and northern zones in heaven are impelled by truths of wisdom, as may be seen in no. <a href="901.htm">901</a> above.</p><p>[2] It is the same with the church on earth, for everyone impelled by the church's goods and truths from the Word is associated with angels in heaven, and he dwells with them in the interiors of his mind - those impelled by the goodness of love in the eastern and western zones of heaven, and those impelled by truths of wisdom in the southern and northern zones of heaven. No one is aware of this, indeed, but everyone nevertheless goes to his place after death.<p>This, then, is the reason that length, when describing the church, symbolizes its goodness, and breadth its truth. Obviously length and breadth cannot be used to describe the church, but they can be to describe a city which symbolizes the church.<p>The symbolic meaning is that goodness and truth in the New Church are united, like essence and form, because we are told that its length is as great as its breadth, and, as we said, its length symbolizes the church's goodness, and its breadth its truth.<p>They are united like essence and form, because truth gives formal expression to goodness, and goodness is the essence of truth, and the essence and the form are united. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 906</h4><p>906. 'The length thereof is as large as the breadth' signifies that the good and truth in that Church make one, like essence and form. By the 'length' of the city Jerusalem is signified the Church's good, and by its 'breadth' is signified the Church's truth. That by 'breadth' is signified truth has been shown from the Word (<a href="861.htm">861</a> above). That by 'length' is signified good, here the Church's good, is derived from the same cause as that 'breadth' signifies truth. This is because the extension of heaven from east to west is understood by 'length,' and the extension of heaven from south to north is understood by 'breadth'; and the angels who dwell in the east and the west of heaven are in the good of love, and the angels who are in the south and the north of heaven are in the truths of wisdom, as may be seen above (<a href="901.htm">901</a>).</p><p>[2] It is similar with the Church on earth, for every man who is in the goods and truths of the Church derived from the Word has been associated with the angels of heaven, and he dwells with them as to the interior things of the mind, those who are in the good of love being in the east and west of heaven, and those who are in the truths of wisdom in the south and north of heaven. This the man does not know, but yet each one comes after death into his own place. It is for this reason then that by 'length' when [said] of a Church is signified its good, and by 'breadth' its truth. It is plain that 'long' and 'broad' cannot be predicated of a Church, but they can of 'a city' by which a Church is signified. The reason why it is signified that the good and truth in that Church make one like essence and form is because it is said that 'the length thereof is as large as the breadth,' and by 'the length' is signified the Church's good, and by 'the breadth' its truth, as has been said. The reason why they make one like essence and form is because truth is the form of good, and good is the essence of truth, and the essence and form make one. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 906</h4><p>906. The length thereof is as large as the breadth, signifies that good and truth in that church make one, like essence and form. By "the length" of the city Jerusalem is signified the good of the church, and by its "breadth" is signified the truth of the church; that by "breadth" is signified truth, is shown from the Word, above, (<a href="861.htm">861</a>). The signification of "length," as being good, here the good of the church, is from the same cause that "breadth" signifies truth; the cause is this: the extension of heaven from east to west is meant by "length," and the extension of heaven from south to north is meant by "breadth," and the angels who dwell in the east and west of heaven are in the good of love, and the angels who dwell in the south and north of heaven are in the truths of wisdom; see above, (<a href="901.htm">901</a>).</p><p>[2] It is the same with the church on earth, for every man who is in the goods and truths of the church from the Word, is consociated with the angels of heaven, and as to the interiors of his mind, dwells together with them; they who are in the good of love in the east and west of heaven, and they who are in the truths of wisdom in the south and north of heaven. Man does not know this indeed, but yet everyone after death comes into his place. Hence then it is that by "length" when speaking of the church, is signified its good, and by "breadth" its truth; that long and broad cannot be predicated of the church, but that they can of a city, by which the church is signified, is evident. The reason why it signifies that good and truth in that church make one like essence and form, is because it is said, that "its length is as large as the breadth," and by "length" is signified the good of the church, and by "breadth" its truth, as was said; the reason why they make one like essence and form, is because truth is the form of good, and good is the essence of truth, and essence and form make one. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 906 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>906. "Longitudo ejus tanta est quanta et latitudo," significat quod bonum et verum in illa Ecclesia unum faciant sicut essentia et forma. -Per "longitudinem" urbis Hierosolymae significatur bonum Ecclesiae, et per "latitudinem" ejus significatur verum Ecclesiae; quod per "latitudinem" significetur verum, supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_906/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_861" target=_top>861</a>) ex Verbo ostensum est. Quod per "longitudinem" significetur bonum, hic bonum Ecclesiae, est ex eadem causa ex qua "latitudo" significat verum; causa est, quia extensio Caeli ab oriente in occidentem intelligitur per "longitudinem," et extensio Caeli a meridie in septentrionem intelligitur per "latitudinem;" et angeli qui in oriente et occidente Caeli habitant in bono amoris sunt, et angeli qui in meridie et septentrione Caeli in veris sapientiae sunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_906/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_901" target=_top>901</a>). Simile est cum Ecclesia in terris; nam omnis homo qui in bonis et veris Ecclesiae ex Verbo est, consociatus est angelis Caeli, et cum illis quoad interiora mentis cohabitat; illi qui in bono amoris sunt, in oriente et occidente Caeli; et illi qui in veris sapientiae sunt, in meridie et septentrione Caeli. Hoc quidem nescit homo; sed tamen unusquisque post mortem in suum locum venit. Inde nunc est quod per "longitudinem," cum de Ecclesia, significetur bonum ejus, et per "latitudinem" verum ejus: quod de Ecclesia non possit praedicari longum et latum, sed quod de urbe per quam significatur Ecclesia possit, patet. Quod significetur quod bonum et verum in illa Ecclesia unum faciant sicut essentia et forma, est quia dicitur quod "longitudo ejus tanta sit quanta et latitudo;" et per "longitudinem" significatur bonum Ecclesiae, et per "latitudinem" verum ejus, ut dictum est: quod unum faciant sicut essentia et forma, est quia verum est forma boni, et bonum est essentia veri, ac essentia et forma unum faciunt. </p>
