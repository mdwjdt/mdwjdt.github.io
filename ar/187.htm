<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第187节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>187.“看哪，我必快来”表主的到来，然后通过他们所形成的新教会。主在此之所以说“看哪，我必快来”，是因为上句经文是说最后的审判。最后的审判也称为主的再临，如马太福音：</p><p>门徒对耶稣说，你来和时代的末了，有什么预兆呢？（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.3.htm">24:3</a>）</p><p>“时代的末了”就是最后的审判即将来临的教会末期。“看哪，我必快来”也表示新教会，因为最后审判之后，教会便由主建立；该教会就是新耶路撒冷，那些通过主处于源自良善的真理之人将进入这个教会，这话就是对他们说的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 187</h4><p>187. "'Behold, I am coming quickly.'" (<a href="3927/revelation_3_11.htm">3:11</a>) This symbolizes the Lord's advent, and a new church then formed of the people here described.<p>The Lord said here, "Behold, I am coming quickly," because the declaration just before this means the Last Judgment, and the Last Judgment is also called the coming of the Lord, as in Matthew,<p>(The disciples said to Jesus,) "...what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?" (<a href="3927/matthew_24_3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>)<p>The end of the age is the final period of the church, at which time the Last Judgment takes place.<p>This statement, "Behold, I am coming quickly," also means a new church, because after the Last Judgment the Lord establishes a new church. This church now is the New Jerusalem, into which will come people who are governed by truths springing from goodness derived from the Lord - the people to whom this announcement is addressed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 187</h4><p>187. [verse 11] 'Behold I am coming quickly' signifies the Lord's coming, and a new Church then [formed] out of them. Here the Lord says, 'Behold I am coming quickly,' because by the words just preceding the last judgment is understood, and the last judgment is also called the Lord's coming, as in Matthew:<p>The disciples said to Jesus, What is the sign of Thy coming, and of the consummation of the age? <a href="3927/matthew_24_3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>.<p>'The consummation of the age' is the last time of the Church, when there is a last judgment. The New Church is also understood by the words 'Behold I am coming quickly,' because after a last judgment a Church is set up by the Lord. That Church now is the New Jerusalem, into which are going to come those who are in truths derived out of good from the Lord, to whom this saying is addressed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 187</h4><p>187. Verse 11. Behold, I come quickly, signifies the Lord's coming, and then the New Church from them. The Lord says here, "Behold, I come quickly," because by the foregoing words is meant the Last Judgment, and the Last Judgment is also called the Lord's coming, as in Matthew:<p>The disciples said unto Jesus, What shall be the sign of Thy coming and of the consummation of the age? (<a href="3927/matthew_24_3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>).<p>"The consummation of the age" is the last time of the church, when the Last Judgment is at hand. The reason why by these words, "Behold, I come quickly," the New Church is also meant, is, because after the Last Judgment, the church is established by the Lord; that church now is the New Jerusalem, into which those will enter who are in truths from good from the Lord, to whom this is addressed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 187 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>187. (Vers. 11.) "Ecce venio cito" significat Adventum Domini, et tunc novam Ecclesiam ex illis. - Dominus hic dixit, "Ecce venio cito," quia per mox praecedentia verba intelligitur Ultimum Judicium, ac Ultimum Judicium etiam vocatur Adventus Domini, ut apud Matthaeum: <p>"Discipuli dixerunt ad Jesum, quodnam signum Tui Adventus et Consummationis saeculi," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_187/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_3" target=_top>24:3</a>);<p>"consummatio saeculi" est ultimum tempus Ecclesiae, quando Ultimum Judicium. Quod per verba "ecce venio cito," etiam intelligatur Nova Ecclesia, est quia post Ultimum Judicium Ecclesia a Domino instauratur; illa Ecclesia ne est Nova Hierosolyma, in quam venturi sunt qui in veris ex bono a Domino sunt, ad quos hic sermo est. </p>
