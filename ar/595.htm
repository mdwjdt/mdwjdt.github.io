<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第595节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>595.“他有两角如同羊羔，说话好像龙”表他们出于圣言的言论、教导和著述貌似主的神性真理，其实这是被歪曲的真理。“角”表示能力（<a href="270.htm">270</a>，<a href="443.htm">443</a>节），在此表示谈论、教导和著述，因而推理和争辩的能力。“两角如同羊羔”表示他们宣传自己的观点，仿佛这些观点是主的神性真理，因为它们出于圣言；“羊羔”表示主的神性人，以及圣言，也就是源于神性良善的神性真理；正因如此，这“兽”，也就是“假先知”（<a href="594.htm">594</a>节）看似有两角如同羊羔；但“说话好像龙”则表示它们是被歪曲的神性真理。圣言的一切真理都被那些陷入龙关于神和救恩的信仰之人歪曲了（参看<a href="566.htm">566</a>节）。</p><p>这兽“有两角如同羊羔，说话好像龙”表示这两样事物，这一点从主在马太福音中的这些话很明显地看出来：</p><p>那时，若有人对你们说，看哪，基督在这里或那里，你们不要信；因为假基督、假先知将要起来，显大神迹、大奇事，倘若能行，连选民也就迷惑了；看哪，我预先告诉你们了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.23.htm">24:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.25.htm">25</a>）</p><p>“基督”在此与“羊羔”所表相同，即表示主的圣言神性真理；故他们说：“看哪，基督在这里”表示他们会说，这是圣言的神性真理；但“若有人对你们说，看哪，基督在这里或那里，你们不要信”这些话表示这是被歪曲的真理。这些人就是主所预言的人，这一点从以下事实明显可知：经上说，他们要“显大神迹、大奇事，倘若能行，连选民也就迷惑了”；同样的事论到“兽”，也就是“假先知”（本章13和14节）身上。主在马太福音24章所预言的事涉及教会的末期或状态，在那里由“时代的完结”来表示。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 595</h4><p>595. And it had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon. This symbolically means that they quote the Word in speaking, teaching and writing as though it were the Lord's Divine truth, and yet it is truth falsified.<p>Horns symbolize power (nos. <a href="270.htm">270</a>, <a href="443.htm">443</a>), here a power in speaking, teaching and writing, thus in reasoning and arguing. That the horns looked like those of a lamb means symbolically that the clergy peddle their doctrines as though they were the Lord's Divine truths, having founded them on the Word. For a lamb means the Lord in respect to His Divine humanity, and also in respect to the Word, which is Divine truth springing from Divine good. That is why on this beast, which is also a false prophet (no. <a href="594.htm">594</a>), two horns were seen like those of a lamb. But that they were Divine truths falsified is symbolized by its speaking like a dragon. To be shown that people caught up in the dragon's faith regarding God and salvation have falsified all the Word's truths, see no. <a href="566.htm">566</a> above.</p><p>[2] That these two characteristics are symbolized by the beast's having two horns like a lamb and speaking like a dragon is clearly apparent from these words of the Lord in Matthew:<p>...if anyone says to you, "Look, here is the Christ!" or "There!" do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand. (<a href="3927/matthew_24_23.htm">Matthew 24:23-25</a>)<p>"Christ" has the same symbolic meaning here as a lamb, namely the Lord in respect to the Word's Divine truth. Consequently, that people will say, "Look, here is the Christ!" means symbolically that they will say that this or that is the Word's Divine truth. But that it is truth falsified is symbolized by the warning, "If anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There!' do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will rise."<p>That it was in reference to the clergy that the Lord made this prediction is apparent from His saying that they would show great signs and wonders and lead astray, if possible, the elect, a statement similar to what is said of the beast here, which is the false prophet, in verses <a href="3927/revelation_13_13.htm">13</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_13_14.htm">14</a> of this chapter.<p>What the Lord predicted in that chapter in Matthew concerned the final period or state of the church, a period or state which is meant there by the end of the age. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="3927/matthew_24_3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 595</h4><p>595. 'And he had two horns like a Lamb, and he was speaking like a dragon' signifies that they speak, teach and write out of the Word as if it were the Lord's Divine Truth, but still it is truth falsified. By 'horns' power is signified (<a href="270.htm">270</a>, <a href="443.htm">443</a>); here power in speaking, teaching and writing, thus in reasoning and arguing. That the horns were seen 'like a Lamb' signifies that they propagate these things of their own as if they were the Lord's Divine Truths, because out of the Word; for by 'the Lamb' is understood the Lord as to the Divine Human, and also as to the Word, which is Divine Truth out of Divine Good. In consequence of this there appeared upon this beast, which also is 'the false prophet' (<a href="594.htm">594</a>), 'two horns like a Lamb'; but that they were Divine Truths falsified is signified by their 'speaking like a dragon.' That by those who are in the faith of the dragon concerning God and salvation all the truths of the Word have been falsified may be seen above (<a href="566.htm">566</a>).</p><p>[2] That these two things are signified by this beast 'having two horns like a Lamb' and 'speaking like a dragon' is quite plain from these words of the Lord in Matthew:<p>If anyone says unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there, believe it not, there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall give great signs and wonders in order to lead into error, if possible, the elect. Behold I have told you in advance. <a href="3927/matthew_24_23.htm">Matthew 24:23-25</a>.<p>The same is signified by 'Christ' here as by 'the Lamb,' namely the Lord as to the Divine Truth of the Word; and therefore that they are going to say 'Lo, here is Christ' signifies that they are going to say that this is the Divine Truth of the Word: but that it is that truth falsified is signified by these words, 'If anyone says unto you, here is Christ or there, believe it not, for there shall arise false Christs and false prophets.' That these are they of whom the Lord made the prediction is plain by reason of this, that it is said that they are going to 'give great signs and wonders' and 'lead into error, if possible, the elect,' similar to what is said of this beast, which is the false prophet (verses 13-14 of this chapter). The things that the Lord foretold in that chapter of Matthew were concerning the last the or state of the Church, which is there understood by 'the consummation of the age. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 595</h4><p>595. And he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like the dragon, signifies that they speak, teach, and write from the Word, as if it were from the Lord's Divine truth, and yet it is truth falsified. By "horns" is signified power, (<a href="270.htm">270</a>, <a href="443.htm">443</a>), here the power of speaking, teaching, and writing, thus of reasoning and arguing. That the horns were seen "like a lamb," signifies that they propagate these their notions as though they were the Lord's Divine truths, because they are from the Word; for by "a lamb" is meant the Lord as to the Divine Human, and also as to the Word, which is the Divine truth from the Divine good; hence it is that upon this beast, which is also the false prophet, (<a href="594.htm">594</a>), there appeared two horns like a lamb; but that they were Divine truths falsified, is signified by "he spoke like a dragon." That all the truths of the Word are falsified by those who are in the faith of the dragon concerning God and salvation, may be seen above, (<a href="566.htm">566</a>).</p><p>[2] That these two things are signified by "this beast had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon," appears evidently from these words of the Lord in Matthew:<p>If anyone shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there, believe it not; for there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall give great signs and wonders, insomuch that if it were possible, they shall lead into error the elect; behold I have told you before, (<a href="3927/matthew_24_23.htm">Matthew 24:23-25</a>).<p>By "Christ" is signified the same as here by "lamb;" namely the Lord as to the Divine truth of the Word; therefore their saying, "Lo, here is Christ," signifies that they would say that this is the Divine truth of the Word; but that it is that falsified is signified by these words: "If anyone shall say unto you, here is Christ, or there, believe it not, for there shall arise false Christs and false prophets." That these are they concerning whom the Lord prophesied, is plain from this, that it is said they would give great signs and wonders, and would if possible lead into error the elect; the same as is said of the beast, which is the false prophet (in verses 13, 14, of this chapter). The things which the Lord foretold in that chapter of Matthew relate to the last time or state of the church, which is there meant by "the consummation of the age." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 595 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>595. "Et habebat duo cornua similia Agno, et loquebatur sicut Draco," significat quod loquantur, doceant et scribant ex Verbo, sicut Divinum Verum Domini foret, et tamen est verum falsificatum. - Per "cornua" significatur potentia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_595/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_270" target=_top>270</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_595/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_443" target=_top>443</a>); hic potentia in loquendo, docendo et scribendo, ita in ratiocinando et argumentando; quod cornua visa sint "similia Agno," significat quod venditent sua illa, sicut forent Divina Vera homini, quia ex Verbo per "Agnum" enim intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum, et quoque quoad Verbum, quod est Divinum Verum ex Divino Bono; inde est, quod super hac Bestia, quae etiam est Pseudopropheta (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_595/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_594" target=_top>594</a>), apparuerint duo cornua similia Agno; quod autem essent Divina Vera falsificata, significatur per quod "loqueretur sicut Draco;" quod ab illis qui in fide Draconis sunt de Deo et de Salvatione, omnia vera Verbi falsificata sint, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_595/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_566" target=_top>566</a>). Quod hoc et illud significetur, per quod Bestia haec haberet "duo cornua similia Agno, et loqueretur sicut Draco," patet manifeste ab his Domini verbis apud Matthaeum. <p>"Si quis dixerit vobis, Ecce hic est Christus, aut ibi,ne credite; surgent falsi Christi et Pseudoprophetae, et dabunt signa magna et prodigia, ut in errorem inducant, si possibile, electos; ecce praedixi vobis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_595/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_23-25" target=_top>24:23-25</a>);<p>per "Christum" simile significatur quod hic per "Agnum," nempe Dominus quoad Divinum Verum Verbi; quare quod dicturi "Ecce hic est Christus," significat quod dicturi quod hoc sit Divinum Verum Verbi quod autem sit illud falsificatum significatur per haec, "Si quis dixerit vobis, hic est Christus aut ibi, ne credite, quia surgent falsi Christi et Pseudoprophetae:" quod hi sint de quibus Dominus praedixit, patet ex eo, quod dicatur, quod "illi daturi sint signa magna et prodigia, ac in errorem inducturi, si possibile, electos;" simile ut de hac Bestia, quae est Pseudopropheta (vers. 13, 14, hujus capitis). Illa quae Dominus praedixit in illo capite apud Matthaeum, fuerunt de Ultimo Tempore seu statu Ecclesiae, qui ibi intelligitur per "Consummationem saeculi." </p>
