<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第62节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>62.“并且我拿着阴间和死亡的钥匙”表唯独祂能拯救。“钥匙”表开与关的权能，在此则表打开地狱使人得出、关闭地狱免得人又进入的权能。因为人生在各种恶中，因而生在地狱当中，因为诸恶就是地狱。他被主从地狱领出来，打开地狱的权能属于主。“拿着阴间和死亡的钥匙”不是指投入地狱的权能，而是指拯救的权能，因为上文说“看哪，我是活着的，直到世世代代”，这句话表示唯独祂是永生（<a href="60.htm">60</a>节）。并且，主从不将任何人投入地狱，而是人将自己投入地狱。“钥匙”表开与关的权能，相关经文还有启示录（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.7.htm">3:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.1.htm">9:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.1.htm">20:1</a>），以赛亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.21.htm">22:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.22.htm">22</a>），马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.19.htm">16:19</a>），路加福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.52.htm">11:52</a>）。主的权能不仅在天堂，也在地狱，因为地狱被保持在正好与天堂相对的秩序和关联中。因此缘故，掌管这一个的也必掌管另一个，否则人无法得救，因为得救就是从地狱被领出来。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 62</h4><p>62. "And I have the keys of hell and death." This symbolically means that He alone is able to save.<p>Keys symbolize the power to open and close - here the power to open hell so that a person can be brought out, and to close it to keep him from going back in once he has been brought out. For people are born into evils of every kind, thus in a state of hell, for evils constitute hell. They are brought out of it by the Lord, who has the power to open it.<p>To have the keys of hell and death does not mean the power to cast into hell, but the power to save, and this because it immediately follows the declaration, "Behold, I am alive forevermore," which symbolically means that the Lord alone is eternal life (no. <a href="60.htm">60</a>). Moreover, the Lord never casts anyone into hell, but it is the person himself who casts himself.<p>Keys symbolize the power to open also in <a href="3927/revelation_3_7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_9_1.htm">9:1</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_1.htm">20:1</a>; in <a href="3927/isaiah_22_21.htm">Isaiah 22:21-22</a>; in <a href="3927/matthew_16_19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>; and in <a href="3927/luke_11_52.htm">Luke 11:52</a>.<p>The Lord's power extends not only over heaven but also over hell, for hell is kept in its order and connection by forces directed against and opposed to heaven. Consequently He who rules the one must necessarily rule the other. Otherwise no one could be saved. To be saved is to be brought out of hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 62</h4><p>62. 'And have the keys of hell and of death' signifies that He Only can save. By 'keys' is signified the power of opening and shutting, here the power of opening hell so that man can be led forth, and of shutting it so that when he has been led out he may not enter again. For man is born into evils of every kind, thus in a hell, for evils are the hell out of which he is led forth by the Lord, Who has the power of opening that hell. The reason why by 'having the keys of hell and of death' is not understood the power of casting into hell but the power of saving is because it follows immediately after the words 'Behold I am the Living One for ages of ages,' by which is signified that He Only is eternal Life (<a href="60.htm">60</a>); and the Lord never casts anyone into hell, but a man casts himself. The power of opening and shutting is signified by 'keys' also in chapters <a href="3927/revelation_3_7.htm">3:7</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_9_1.htm">9:1</a>; and <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21</a>, of the Apocalypse; again in <a href="3927/isaiah_22_21.htm">Isaiah 22:21-22</a>, in <a href="3927/matthew_16_19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>, and in. <a href="3927/luke_11_52.htm">Luke 11:52</a>. The Lord's power is not only over heaven, but also over hell, for hell is kept in order and connection by oppositions against heaven; and therefore He Who rules the one will of necessity rule the other. Otherwise man could not be saved. To be saved is to be led forth from hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 62</h4><p>62. And I have the keys of hell and death, signifies that He alone can save. By "keys" is signified the power of opening and shutting; here the power of opening hell, that man may be brought forth, and of shutting, lest, when he is brought forth, he should enter again. For man is born in evils of all kinds, thus in hell, for evils are hell; he is brought out of it by the Lord, to whom belongs the power of opening it. That by "having the keys of hell and death," is not meant the power of casting into hell, but the power of saving, is because it immediately follows after these words:<p>Behold, I am alive for ages of ages;<p>by which is signified that He alone is eternal life, (<a href="60.htm">60</a>); and the Lord never casts anyone into hell, but man casts himself. By "keys" is signified the power of opening and shutting, in Revelation also, (<a href="3927/revelation_3_7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_9_1.htm">9:1</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_1.htm">20:1</a>; also in <a href="3927/isaiah_22_21.htm">Isaiah 22:21-22</a>; in <a href="3927/matthew_16_19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>; and in <a href="3927/luke_11_52.htm">Luke 11:52</a>). The power of the Lord is not only over heaven, but also over hell; for hell is kept in order and connection by oppositions against heaven; for which reason, He who rules the one must necessarily rule the other; otherwise man could not be saved; to be saved is to be brought out of hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 62 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>62. "Et habeo claves inferni et mortis," significat quod Solus salvare possit. - Per "claves" significatur potentia aperiendi et claudendi, hic potentia aperiendi infernum, ut homo educi possit, et claudendi, ne dum eductus est, reintret; homo enim natus est in mala omnis generis, ita in inferno, nam mala sunt infernum; ex eo educitur a Domino, Cui potentia est aperiendi illud. Quod per "habere claves inferni et mortis," non intelligatur potentia conjiciendi infernum, sed potentia salvandi, est quia sequitur statim est haec, "Ecce Vivens sum in saecula saeculorum," per quae significatur quod Solus sit Vita aeterna (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_62/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_60" target=_top>60</a>), et Dominus nusquam aliquem in infernum conjicit, sed ipse homo semet. Per "claves" significatur potentia aperiendi claudendi etiam in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_62/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_7" target=_top>Apocalypsi 3:7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_62/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_9_1" target=_top>9:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_62/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_1" target=_top>20:1</a>; tum apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_62/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_22_21-22" target=_top>Esajam 22:21-22</a>; apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_62/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_16_19" target=_top>Matthaeum 16:19</a>; et apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_62/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_11_52" target=_top>Lucam 11:52</a>. Potentia Domini non solum est super Caelum sed etiam super infernum, nam infernum tenetur in ordine et connexu per oppositiones contra Caelum; quare Qui regit unum necessario reget alterum alioquin non potuisset homo salvari; Salvari est educi ab inferno. </p>
