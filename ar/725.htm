<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第725节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>725.启17:4.“那女人穿着紫色和朱红色的衣服”表他们当中属于圣言的属天神性良善和神性真理。“紫色”表示属天的神性良善，“朱红色”表示属天的神性真理，这一点很快就会看到；“穿着”它们表示它们在他们周围，因而与他们同在。来自圣言的这些事物之所以与他们同在，是因为那个女人所骑的“朱红色的兽”表示圣言（<a href="723.htm">723</a>节）。人们知道，圣言的神性良善和神性真理如一件衣服在他们周围，因而与他们同在，因为从外面看，他们崇敬圣言，但从里面看，却不是；他们承认圣言，因为圣言论述主，论述祂对天堂和教会的权柄，他们却将这权柄转到自己这里；圣言还论述赐给彼得的钥匙，他们声称自己是彼得的继任者。他们因将自己的威严、尊贵和权柄建立在这两点上，故有必当承认圣言的神圣。然而，圣言对他们来说，只不过像是“紫色和朱红色、嵌有金子宝石珍珠”的衣服，披在手拿金杯、杯中盛满了可憎之物和淫乱污秽的淫妇身上。</p><p>由于经上提到“紫色和朱红色”，然后又提到“金子、宝石和珍珠”，而“紫色和朱红色”表示属天的神性良善和真理，“金子和宝石”表示属灵的神性良善和真理，二者皆出自圣言，故有必要先说一说属天神性和属灵神性。主的整个天堂划分为两大国度，即属天国度和属灵国度；属天国度由从主处于爱的天使组成，属灵国度由从主处于智慧的天使组成。这两个国度都有良善和真理；属天国度的天使所拥有的良善和真理以“紫色和朱红色”来表示，属灵国度的天使所拥有的良善和真理以“金子和宝石”来表示。天使从主那里通过圣言拥有这两类良善与真理；所以，圣言有两种内在意义，即属天之义和属灵之义。这就是为何骑在朱红色兽上的“那女人穿着紫色和朱红色、嵌有金子宝石珍珠的衣服”的原因。</p><p>以下经文中的与这“女人”所表相同：</p><p>有一个财主穿着紫色袍和细麻布衣服，天天奢华宴乐。拉撒路被人放在财主门口，要得财主桌子上掉下来的零碎充饥。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.19.htm">16:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.21.htm">21</a>）</p><p>“穿着紫色袍和细麻布衣服”的“财主”是指犹太人，他们拥有圣言；“拉撒路”是指没有圣言的外邦人。以下经文中的表示类似事物：</p><p>素来吃美好食物的，现今在街上变为孤寒；素来卧朱红褥子的，现今躺卧粪堆。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.5.htm">4:5</a>）</p><p>你使人凄凉的时候，要怎样行呢？你虽穿上朱红衣服，佩戴黄金装饰，这样标致是枉然的。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.30.htm">4:30</a>）</p><p>以色列的女子啊，当为扫罗哭号，他曾使你们穿朱红色的美衣，使你们衣服有黄金的妆饰。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.24.htm">1:24</a>）</p><p>你的篷帆是用细麻布做的，你的凉棚是用蓝色、紫色布做的。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.7.htm">27:7</a>）</p><p>这论及推罗，推罗表示对来自圣言的真理和良善的认知。</p><p>由于“紫色和朱红色”表示属天的良善和真理，故亚伦的圣衣，和会幕的幔子并门帘一样，也是用蓝色、紫色、朱红色线以及细麻织成（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.4.htm">26:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.31.htm">31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.36.htm">36</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.16.htm">27:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.6.htm">28:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.15.htm">15</a>）；还有幔子（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.1.htm">26:1</a>）；约柜前的幔子（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.31.htm">26:31</a>）；会幕门上的门帘（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.36.htm">26:36</a>）；院子大门上的门帘（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.16.htm">27:16</a>）；以弗得（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.6.htm">28:6</a>）；带子（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.8.htm">28:8</a>）；决断的胸牌（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.15.htm">28:15</a>）；以弗得袍子周围的底边（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.33.htm">28:33</a>）；蒙陈设饼的朱红色布（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.8.htm">4:8</a>）。从这些经文明显可知，骑在朱红色兽上的女人所穿的“紫色和朱红色衣服”表示什么。以下经文中的也一样，经上说：</p><p>哀哉，这大城啊，素常穿着细麻，紫色和朱红色的衣服，又嵌有金子宝石珍珠；一时之间，这么大的财富已变为荒凉了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.16.htm">18:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.17.htm">17</a>）</p><p>还有：</p><p>巴比伦的货物当中有紫色料，朱红色料，黄金，宝石，珍珠。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.2.htm">18:2</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 725</h4><p>725. <a href="3927/revelation_17_4.htm">17:4</a> The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet. This symbolizes the celestial Divine good and truth contained in the Word among Roman Catholics.<p>Purple symbolizes celestial Divine good, and scarlet symbolizes celestial Divine truth, as will be seen presently. To be arrayed in them means, symbolically, to have these about them, thus among them. They have these among them from the Word, because the scarlet beast on which the woman was sitting symbolizes the Word (no. <a href="723.htm">723</a>).<p>People know that Roman Catholics have the Divine good and truth in the Word about them, thus among them, as a kind of garment, for they venerate the Word outwardly and not inwardly. They acknowledge it, because it tells about the Lord and about His authority over heaven and the church, which they have transferred to themselves. It also tells about the keys given to Peter, whose successors they say they are. So, because they found their majesty, grandeur and power on these two points, of necessity they acknowledge the holiness of the Word. But still the Word is for them only a kind of garment of purple and scarlet, and of gold, precious stones and pearls, upon a harlot holding a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and the filthiness of her licentiousness.</p><p>[2] Since the verse mentions purple and scarlet, and then gold, precious stones and pearls, and since purple and scarlet symbolize celestial Divine good and truth, while gold and precious stones symbolize spiritual Divine good and truth, both emanating from the Word, therefore we must say something about celestial Divinity and spiritual Divinity:<p>The Lord's whole heaven has been divided into two kingdoms - the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom. The celestial kingdom consists of angels who are impelled by love from the Lord, and the spiritual kingdom of angels who are impelled by wisdom from the Lord. Each kingdom has in it goodness and truth. The goodness and truth among angels in the celestial kingdom are symbolized by purple and scarlet, while the goodness and truth among angels in the spiritual kingdom are symbolized by gold and precious stones. Angels have both the one and the other goodness and truth from the Lord by means of the Word. Consequently the Word has in it two interior levels of meaning, one celestial and the other spiritual.<p>This now is the reason that the woman sitting on the scarlet beast appeared arrayed in purple and scarlet and adorned with gold, precious stones and pearls.</p><p>[3] Like the symbolism of the woman here is the symbolism of the "rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day," at whose gate Lazarus lay prostrate, "desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table" (<a href="3927/luke_16_19.htm">Luke 16:19-21</a>). The rich man clothed in purple and fine linen refers to the Jews, who had the Word, and Lazarus refers to the gentiles who did not have it.<p>Similar symbolic meanings are found in the following places:<p>Those who ate delicacies are devastated in the streets; those who were brought up on scarlet embrace dunghills. (<a href="3927/lamentations_4_5.htm">Lamentations 4:5</a>)<p>When you are plundered, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold..., in vain you will make yourself fair. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_4_30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>)<p>O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with luxury, (and) who put ornaments of gold on your apparel. (<a href="3927/2-samuel_1_24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24</a>)<p>Fine embroidered linen... was what you spread...; blue and purple... was your covering. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_27_7.htm">Ezekiel 27:7</a>)<p>The last is said of Tyre, which symbolizes concepts of truth and goodness from the Word.</p><p>[4] Since purple and scarlet symbolize celestial goodness and truth, therefore Aaron's vestments and the veil and curtains of the Tabernacle were woven of blue, purple, scarlet and fine linen (<a href="3927/exodus_25_4.htm">Exodus 25:4</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">26:31</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_36.htm">36</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_27_16.htm">27:16</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_28_6.htm">28:6</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_28_15.htm">15</a>). Regarding the curtains (<a href="3927/exodus_26_1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>). The veil before the Ark (<a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>). The hem of the robe of the ephod (<a href="3927/exodus_28_33.htm">Exodus 28:33</a>). The scarlet cloth over the showbread (<a href="3927/numbers_4_8.htm">Numbers 4:8</a>).<p>It is apparent from this what is symbolized by the purple and scarlet with which the woman sitting on the scarlet beast appeared arrayed.<p>So likewise in the following passage, where we read:<p>Alas..., the great city that was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet..., adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls! For in one hour such great riches were laid waste. (<a href="3927/revelation_18_16.htm">Revelation 18:16-17</a>)<p>Moreover, purple and scarlet, gold, precious stones and pearls were among the merchandise of Babylon (<a href="3927/revelation_18_12.htm">Revelation 18:12</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 725</h4><p>725. [verse 4] 'And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet' signifies the celestial Divine Good and Divine Truth that are of the Word, with them. By 'purple' is signified celestial Divine Good, and by 'scarlet' is signified celestial Divine Truth, concerning which [something] follows. 'To be arrayed' with them signifies to be around them, thus with them. The reason why those things are derived from the Word with them is because by 'the scarlet beast' upon which the woman was sitting is signified the Word (<a href="723.htm">723</a>). That the Divine Good and Truth of the Word is about them as clothing, thus with them, is known; for they adore the Word from without and not from within, they acknowledge it because it treats of the Lord, and of His authority over heaven and the Church, which they transfer to themselves. Also it treats of the keys given to Peter, whose successors they say they are; and because their majesty, dignity and authority is founded upon these two [statements] they of necessity acknowledge the holiness of the Word. But still the Word to them is only like the garment 'of purple and scarlet, and gold, precious stone, and pearls' upon the harlot holding' in her hand a golden cup full of the abominations and uncleanness of her whoredom.</p><p>[2] Since 'purple and scarlet' are mentioned, and then 'gold, precious stone and pearls,' and by 'purple and scarlet 'is signified celestial Divine Good and Truth, and by 'gold and precious stone' spiritual Divine Good and Truth, each of them derived from the Word, therefore something shall be said concerning the celestial Divine and the spiritual Divine. There are two kingdoms into which the entire heaven of the Lord has been distinguished, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom. The celestial kingdom consists of angels who are in love from the Lord, and the spiritual kingdom of angels who are in wisdom from the Lord. In each one of the kingdoms there is good and truth, the good and truth with the angels of the celestial kingdom being signified by 'purple and scarlet,' and the good and truth with the angels of the spiritual kingdom by 'gold and precious stone.' The angels have both the latter and the former goods and truths from the Lord by means of the Word. In the Word there are therefore two interior senses, the celestial and the spiritual. This then is the reason why 'the woman sitting upon the scarlet beast' was seen 'arrayed in purple and scarlet' as well as 'decked with gold, precious stone, and pearls.</p><p>[3] Something similar to what is meant by this woman is signified by:<p>The rich man, who was clothed with purple and fine linen and was indulging splendidly every day in sumptuous living, at whose forecourt Lazarus was cast desiring to be filled with the morsels falling from his table. <a href="3927/luke_16_19.htm">Luke 16:19-21</a>.<p>By 'the rich man clothed with purple and fine linen' are understood the Jews, who had the Word; and by 'Lazarus' are understood the Gentiles, who did not have it. Similar things are signified in the following passages:<p>Those who have eaten delicacies have been devastated in the streets; those who have been brought up upon scarlet have embraced the dunghill. <a href="3927/lamentations_4_5.htm">Lamentations 4:5</a>.<p>Therefore thou wasted one, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with scarlet, though thou adornest thyself with an ornament of gold, in vain shalt thou make thyself beautiful. <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>.<p>Daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who covered you in scarlet with delicate things, and who put an ornament of gold upon [your] apparel, <a href="3927/2-samuel_1_24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24</a>.<p>Fine linen of needlework was thy spread [sail], hyacinthine and purple was thy covering. <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_7.htm">Ezekiel 27:7</a>; speaking of Tyre, by which are signified cognitions of truth and good out of the Word.</p><p>[4] Since celestial good and truth are signified by purple and scarlet,' therefore Aaron's garments, as also the veils and curtains of the tabernacle, were woven of hyacinthine, purple, scarlet and fine linen (<a href="3927/exodus_25_4.htm">Exodus 25:4</a>; [<a href="3927/exodus_26_1.htm">Exodus 26</a>:] <a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_26_36.htm">36</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_27_16.htm">27:16</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_28_6.htm">28:6</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_28_15.htm">15</a>. The curtains (<a href="3927/exodus_26_1.htm">26:1</a>). The veil before the ark (<a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">26:31</a>). The covering for the door of the tent (<a href="3927/exodus_26_36.htm">26:36</a>). The covering of the gate of the court (<a href="3927/exodus_27_16.htm">27:16</a>). The ephod (<a href="3927/exodus_28_6.htm">28:6</a>). The girdle (<a href="3927/exodus_28_8.htm">28:8</a>). The breastplate of judgment (<a href="3927/exodus_28_15.htm">28:15</a>). The fringe of the coat of the ephod (<a href="3927/exodus_28_33.htm">28:33</a>). The cloth of scarlet over the bread of faces (<a href="3927/numbers_4_8.htm">Numbers 4:8</a>). From these references it is plain what is signified by the 'purple and scarlet' with which the woman sitting upon the scarlet beast appeared arrayed. In like manner in the things following, where it is said:<p>Alas, the great city that had been clothed with fine linen and purple and scarlet, decked with gold and precious stone and pearls; for in one hour so great riches have been laid waste. <a href="3927/revelation_18_16.htm">Revelation 18:16-17</a>.<p>Also that purple and scarlet, gold, precious stone and pearls were among the merchandise of Babylon (<a href="3927/revelation_18_12.htm">Revelation 18:12</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 725</h4><p>725. Verse 4. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, signifies celestial Divine good and Divine truth, which are of the Word with them. By "purple" is signified celestial Divine good, and by "scarlet" is signified celestial Divine truth, as will be seen presently; by "being clothed" with them is signified to have them about them, consequently with them. The reason why these principles are with them from the Word, is because by "the scarlet beast" upon which the woman sat is signified the Word, (<a href="723.htm">723</a>). That the Divine good and truth of the Word is about them as a garment, thus with them, is known, for they adore the Word from without and not from within; they acknowledge it, because it treats of the Lord, and of His power over heaven and the church, which they have transferred to themselves; and it treats of the keys given to Peter, whose successors they say they are. And since upon these two they found their majesty, dignity, and authority, they of necessity acknowledge the holiness of the Word. But yet the Word to them is only like the garment of "purple and scarlet and of gold, precious stones and pearls," upon a harlot holding in her hand a golden cup, full of abominations and uncleanness of whoredom.</p><p>[2] Since "purple and scarlet" are mentioned, and then "gold, precious stones, and pearls," and by "purple and scarlet" is signified celestial Divine good and truth, and by "gold and precious stones" spiritual Divine good and truth, both from the Word, therefore something shall be said concerning the celestial Divine and the spiritual Divine.

Both these goods and truths the angels have from the Lord through the Word; wherefore there are two interior senses of the Word, the celestial and the spiritual. This then is the reason why "the woman sitting upon the scarlet beast appeared arrayed in purple and scarlet, and inwrought with gold and precious stones, and pearls."</p><p>[3] The same which is signified by this woman is also signified by:<p>The rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and indulged in delicacies every day splendidly at whose gateway Lazarus was cast, desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from his table, (<a href="3927/luke_16_19.htm">Luke 16:19-21</a>).<p>By "the rich man clothed in purple and fine linen" the Jews are meant, who had the Word; and by "Lazarus" are meant the Gentiles, who had it not.

It is manifest from these passages what is signified by "the purple and scarlet" with which the woman that sat upon the scarlet beast appeared arrayed. In like manner in the following passages, where it is said:<p>Alas, the great city, which was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, inwrought with gold and precious stone and pearls; for in one hour so great riches are devastated, (<a href="3927/revelation_18_16.htm">Revelation 18:16-17</a>).<p>Also that purple and scarlet, gold, precious stone, and pearls, were among the merchandise of Babylon, see <a href="3927/revelation_18_12.htm">Revelation 18:12</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 725 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>725. (Vers. 4.) "Et Mulier circuminduta purpura et coccino," significat Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum Caeleste, quae sunt Verbi, apud illos. -Per "purpuram" significatur Divinum Bonum caeleste, et per "coccinum" significatur Divinum Verum caeleste, de quibus sequitur; "circumindui" illis significat circum illos esse, ita apud illos; quod illa sint ex Verbo apud illos, est quia per "Bestiam coccineam," super qua Mulier sedebat, significatur Verbum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723" target=_top>723</a>); quod Divinum Bonum et Verum Verbi sit circum illos sicut indumentum, ita apud illos, notum est: adorant enim Verbum ab extra et non ab intra; agnoscunt illud, quia agit de Domino, et de Ipsius potestate super Caelum et super Ecclesiam, quam in se transtulerunt; et agit de clavibus datis Petro, cujus successores se dicunt esse: et quia super his duobus fundatur eorum majestas, dignitas et potestas, ex necessitate sanctitatem Verbi agnoscunt; sed usque est Verbum illis modo sicut Vestis ex "purpura et coccino exque auro, lapide pretioso et margaritis," super Meretrice tenente poculum aureum in manu sua, plenum abominationibus et immunditie scortationis. Quoniam dicitur "purpura et coccinum," et dein "aurum, lapis pretiosus et margaritae," et per "purpuram et coccinum" significatur Divinum Bonum et Verum caeleste, ac per "aurum et lapidem pretiosum" Divinum Bonum et Verum spirituale, utrumque ex Verbo, ideo aliquid dicetur de Divino Caelesti et de Divino Spirituali: -Sunt duo Regna, in quae universum Caelum Domini distinctum est, Regnum Caeleste et Regnum Spirituale; Regnum Caeleste consistit ex angelis qui in Amore a Domino sunt, et Regnum spirituale ex angelis qui in Sapientia a Domino sunt. In unoquovis Regno est Bonum et Verum; Bonum et Verum apud angelos Regni Caelestis, significatur per "purpuram et coccinum," ac Bonum et Verum apud angelos Regni spiritualis significatur per "aurum et lapidem pretiosum." Haec et illa Bona et Vera sunt angelis a Domino per Verbum; quare in Verbo sunt bini Sensus interiores, caelestis et spiritualis. Inde nunc est, quod Mulier sedens super Bestia coccinea visa sit "circuminduta purpura et coccino," tum "inaurata auro, lapide pretioso et margaritis." Simile quod per "Mulierem" hanc significatur per Hominem divitem, qui "induebatur purpura et bysso, et lautitiis indulgebat quotidie splendide;" ad cujus vestibulum projectus est Lazarus, desiderans "saturari ex micis cadentibus ex mensa ejus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_16_19-21" target=_top>Luca 16:19-21</a>);<p>per "divitem indutum purpura et bysso" intelliguntur Judaei, qui habebant Verbum; et per "Lazarum" intelliguntur Gentes quae non habebant. Similia significantur in sequentibus his: <p>"Qui comederunt lautitias, devastati sunt in plateis; educati super Coccinum, amplexi sunt sterquilinium," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_lamentations_4_5" target=_top>Threni 4:5</a>);<p>"Tu ergo vastata quid facies; si indueris te Coccino, si ornaveris te ornatu auri, frustra pulchram te reddes," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_4_30" target=_top>Jeremias 4:30</a>);<p>"Filiae Israelis supra Schaule flete, qui amicivit vos Coccino cum delicatis, et qui posuit ornatum auri super vestem," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-samuel_1_24" target=_top>2 Samuelis 1:24</a>);<p>"Byssus ex acupictura fuit expansio tua, hyacinthinum et purpura fuit tegumentum tuum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_27_7" target=_top>Ezechiel 27:7</a>);<p>ibi de "Tyro," per quam significantur cognitiones veri et boni ex Verbo. Quoniam per "purpuram et coccinum" significantur Bonum et Verum Caeleste, ideo Vestes Aharonis, ut et Vela et Aulaea Tabernaculi, contexta erant ex hyacinthino, Purpura, Coccino et bysso, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_26_4" target=_top>Exodus 26:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_26_31" target=_top>31</a>; <sup>1</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_27_16" target=_top>27:16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_28_6" target=_top>28:6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_28_15" target=_top>15</a>);<p>Quod Aulaea, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_26_1" target=_top>Exodus 26:1</a>);<p>Quod Velum ante Arcam, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_26_31" target=_top>Exodus 26:31</a>);<p>Quod Tegumentum pro ostio Tentorii, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_26_36" target=_top>Exodus 26:36</a>);<p>Quod Tegumentum portae atrii (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_27_16" target=_top>Exodus 27:16</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>Quod Ephodum, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_28_6" target=_top>Exodus 28:6</a>);<p>Quod Baltheus, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_28_8" target=_top>Exodus 28:8</a>);<p>Quod Pectorale judicii, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_28_15" target=_top>Exodus 28:15</a>); <sup>3</sup><p>Quod Fimbriae pallii Ephodi, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_28_33" target=_top>Exodus 28:33</a>);<p>Quod Pannus Coccini super panes facierum, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_4_8" target=_top>Numeri 4:8</a>).<p>Ex his patet, quid per "purpuram et coccinum," quibus circuminduta apparuit Mulier sedens super Bestia coccinea, significatur.
