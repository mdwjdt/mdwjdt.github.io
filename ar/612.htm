href="618.htm">618</a>节）。“从地上买来的”表他们就是那些能被主重生，因而在世上被救赎的人（<a href="619.htm">619</a>节）。</p><p>第4节.“这些人未曾沾染妇女，他们原是童身”表他们没有在教会的真理中掺入杂质，以信之虚假玷污它们，而是因它们是真理而热爱真理（<a

href="629.htm">629</a>节）。“应当敬拜那创造天地海和众水泉源的”表唯独主要受到敬拜，因为唯独祂是创造者，救主，救世主，并且天使天堂和教会，以及它们的一切皆来自祂（<a href="630.htm">630</a>节）。</p><p>第8节.“又有一位天使接着说，巴比伦大城倾倒了，倾倒了”表天主教的信条和教义如今被驱散（<a href="631.htm">631</a>节）。“因她叫列族喝她邪淫烈怒的酒”表因着对圣言的亵渎和对教会良善并真理的玷污，她已迷惑了她能辖制的所有人（<a href="632.htm">632</a>节）。</p><p>第9节.“又有第三位天使，接着他们，大声说”表主进一步揭露那些陷入与仁分离之信的人（<a href="633.htm">633</a>节）。“若有人拜兽和兽像，在额上，或在手上，受了印记”表凡承认并接受唯信称义并得救的教义之人，都确认它，并照之生活（<a href="634.htm">634</a>节）。</p><p>第10，11节.“他也必喝神烈怒的酒，此酒斟在神愤怒的杯中纯一不杂”表他们歪曲圣言的良善与真理，并使生命充满这类歪曲（<a href="635.htm">635</a>节）。“他要在圣天使面前和羔羊面前，在火与硫磺之中受痛苦。他们受痛苦的烟往上冒，世世无穷”表对自我和世界的爱，并由此衍生的欲望，以及由此而来的对自我聪明的骄傲，还有由此产生的地狱的折磨（<a href="636.htm">636</a>节）。“那些拜兽和兽像受他名之印记的，昼夜不得安宁”表对那些承认并接受这信，确认它，并照之生活的人来说，持续处于令人不快的事物中的状态（<a href="637.htm">637</a>节）。</p><p>第12节.“圣徒的忍耐就在此。守神诫命，和耶稣基督信仰的也在此”表主的教会之人通过源于那些陷入与仁分离之信之人的试探，在其遵行圣言诫命的生活和对主之信的性质上接受检查（<a href="638.htm">638</a>节）。</p><p>第13节.“我听见从天上有声音对我说，你要写下，从今以后，在主里面而死的死人有福了”表主关于那些将属于其新教会之人死后状态的预言，即他们将拥有永生和幸福（<a href="639.htm">639</a>节）。“圣灵说，是的，他们息了自己的劳苦”表圣言的神性真理教导，那些苦待自己的灵魂，并为此将自己的肉体钉在十字架上的人将在主里面得平安（<a href="640.htm">640</a>节）。“他们所作的工也随着他们”表照着他们所爱和所信，随之所行和所言（<a href="641.htm">641</a>节）</p><p>第14节.“我又观看，见有一片白云，云上坐着一位好像人子”表主的圣言（<a href="642.htm">642</a>节）。“头上戴着金冠冕，手里拿着快镰刀”表源于神性之爱的神性智慧，和圣言的神性真理（<a href="643.htm">643</a>节）。</p><p>第15节.“又有一位天使从殿中出来”表天使天堂（<a

href="648.htm">648</a>节）。“向拿着快镰刀的大声喊着说，伸出快镰刀来收取佳酿，就是地上葡萄园串串的果子”表主通过其爱之良善藉其圣言神性真理的运作进入基督教会之人里面的仁与信的行为中（<a href="649.htm">649</a>节）。“因为葡萄熟透了”表因为这是基督教会的最后状态（<a href="649.htm">649</a>节）。</p><p>第19节.“那天使就把镰刀扔在地上，收取了地上的葡萄园”表当今基督教会的终结（<a href="650.htm">650</a>节）。“丢在神烈怒的大酒榨中”表对他们行为的性质的审查，即它们是邪恶（<a href="651.htm">651</a>节）。</p><p>第20节.“那酒榨踹在城外”表通过圣言的神性真理审查从教会的信之教义所流出的行为的性质（<a href="652.htm">652</a>节）。“就有血从酒榨里流出来，涨到马的嚼环”表对真理的可怕歪曲向圣言施暴，理解或认知由此封闭，以致人几乎不能再受教，因而不能被主藉着神性真理引领（<a href="653.htm">653</a>节）。“远有一千六百斯他丢”表纯邪恶的虚假（<a href="654.htm">654</a>节）。</p><h4 align="center">诠释</h4><p>612.启14:1.“我又观看，见羔羊站在锡安山，同祂又有十四万四千人”表如今主所在的新天堂，是由基督教会中那些承认唯独主为天地之神，并通过圣言处于源自祂的教义真理的基督徒聚集而成。“我观看”表示本章接下来的事；“羔羊”表示主的神性人（<a href="269.htm">269</a>，<a href="271.htm">271</a>节）；稍后会看到，“锡安山”表示天堂，就是那些爱主之人所在之地；“十四万四千”表示所有承认唯独主为天地之神，并通过圣言处于源自主出于爱之良善的教义真理之人（<a href="348.htm">348</a>节等）。第七章已论述过这些人；但在那里，他们“额上受了印”，从而与其余的人区分并分开；然而，现在他们集合为一体，一个天堂便由他们形成。</p><p>此处所论述的天堂是由基督徒聚集而成的天堂，就是自主在世时的时代起，诸如唯独靠近主，通过避恶如对抗神的罪而照祂在圣言中的诫命生活的那类基督徒。该天堂就是新天堂，圣耶路撒冷，也就是地上的新教会将从该天堂而降（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.1.htm">21:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.2.htm">2</a>）。但主降世前所形成的诸天堂在该天堂之上，被称为古天堂；古天堂中的所有人同样承认唯独主为天地之神。这些天堂通过流注与这个新天堂相通。</p><p>众所周知，“迦南地”表示教会，因为圣言在那里，主通过圣言为人所知；还因为锡安城就在迦南地当中，锡安城下面是耶路撒冷城，两座城都在山上。因此，“锡安”与“耶路撒冷”表示教会最内在的事物；又因为天堂里的教会与地上的教会合而为一，故“锡安”与“耶路撒冷”表示这两个世界（即天上和地上）中的教会；不过，“锡安”表示教会的爱；“耶路撒冷”表示由此而来的教会教义。这山之所以叫“锡安山”，是因为“山”表示爱（<a href="336.htm">336</a>节）。</p><p>“锡安山”表示天堂与教会，在那里，唯独主受到敬拜。这一点从以下经文明显看出来:</p><p>我已经在锡安膏立我的君；我要传圣旨，你是我的儿子，我今日生你；我要将列族赐你为基业；当亲吻儿子，恐怕祂发怒，你们便灭亡；凡投靠祂的，都是有福的。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗2.6.htm">2:6</a>-<a

href="http://39-27.cn/约12.15.htm">15</a>）</p><p>锡安的居民哪，当喊叫欢呼；因为在你们中间的以色列圣者乃为至大。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛12.6.htm">12:6</a>）</p><p>耶和华救赎的人必归回，歌唱来到锡安。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.10.htm">35:10</a>）</p><p>锡安的女儿啊，应当欢呼快乐，看哪，我来要住在你中间。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.10.htm">2:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.11.htm">11</a>）</p><p>但愿以色列的救恩从锡安而出 。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗14.7.htm">14:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗53.6.htm">53:6</a>）</p><p>主耶和华要在锡安放一块试验石，你们与死亡所立的约必然废掉。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.16.htm">28:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.18.htm">18</a>）</p><p>我的救恩必不迟延，我要在锡安施行救恩。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛46.13.htm">46:13</a>）</p><p>那时，必有一位救赎主来到锡安。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.20.htm">59:20</a>）</p><p>万军之耶和华必在锡安山掌权。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.23.htm">24:23</a>）</p><p>耶和华爱锡安的门，胜于爱雅各一切的住处；神之城啊，有荣耀的事乃指着你说的；这一个生在那里；我一切的泉源都在你里面。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗87.2.htm">87:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗87.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗87.6.htm">6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗87.7.htm">7</a>）</p><p>耶和华拣选了锡安，愿意当作自己的居所；这是我永远安息之所，我要住在这里。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗132.13.htm">132:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗132.14.htm">14</a>）</p><p>愿锡安的儿女因他们的王快乐。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗 149.2.htm"> 149:2</a>）</p><p>耶和华必起来怜恤锡安，日期已经到了；耶和华的名要在锡安传扬，就是万民聚会和列国事奉耶和华的时候。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗102.13.htm">102:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗102.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗102.21.htm">21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗102.22.htm">22</a>）</p><p>神必从锡安发出光来；我们的神要来，呼召上天下地说，招聚我的圣民到我这里来。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗50.2.htm">50:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗50.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p>此外还有其它地方（如以赛亚书<a

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 612</h4><p>612. REVELATION: CHAPTER 14<p>1. Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father's name written on their foreheads.<p>2. And I heard a voice from heaven, like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of loud thunder. And I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps.<p>3. They sang as it were a new song before the throne, before the four living creatures, and before the elders; and no one could learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth.<p>4. These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were redeemed from among men, being firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.<p>5. And in their mouth was found no deceit, for they are without fault before the throne of God.<p>6. Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth - to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people -<p>7. saying with a loud voice, "Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water."<p>8. And another angel followed, saying, "Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her licentiousness."<p>9. Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and its image, and receives its mark on his forehead or on his hand,<p>10. he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed with pure wine in the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.<p>11. And the smoke of their torment will ascend forever and ever; and they will have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name."<p>12. Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus (Christ.)<p>13. Then I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, "Write: 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.' " "Yes," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors, for their works follow them."<p>14. Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat One like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.<p>15. And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, "Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the hour has come for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth has dried."<p>16. So He who sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.<p>17. Then another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.<p>18. And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire, and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are ripe."<p>19. So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vintage of the vine of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.<p>20. And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, up to the horses' bridles, for one thousand six hundred furlongs.<p>THE SPIRITUAL MEANING<p>The Contents of the Whole Chapter<p>The New Christian Heaven, described in verses <a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">1-5</a>.

Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand,</td><td>The Lord now present in a new heaven formed of Christians who acknowledged Him as God of heaven and earth, and had doctrinal truths received from Him through the Word.</td></tr><tr><td>having His Father's name written on their foreheads.</td><td>The acknowledgment among them of the Lord's Divinity and of His Divine humanity.</td></tr><tr><td>2. And I heard a voice from heaven, like the voice of many waters,</td><td>The Lord speaking through the new heaven with Divine truths,</td></tr><tr><td>and like the voice of loud thunder.</td><td>and out of Divine love.</td></tr><tr><td>And I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps.</td><td>A confession of the Lord from a glad heart by spiritual angels in the lower heavens.</td></tr><tr><td>3. They sang as it were a new song before the throne, before the four living creatures, and before the elders;</td><td>A celebration and glorification of the Lord in His presence and in the presence of the angels of the higher heavens.</td></tr><tr><td>and no one could learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand</td><td>No other Christians could understand and so acknowledge out of love and faith that the Lord alone is God of heaven and earth but those received by the Lord into this new heaven.</td></tr><tr><td>who were redeemed from the earth.</td><td>They are people who could be regenerated by the Lord and so be redeemed in the world.</td></tr><tr><td>4. These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins.</td><td>They did not adulterate the church's truths or defile them with the falsities of their faith, but loved the truths because they are true.</td></tr><tr><td>These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes.</td><td>They are conjoined with the Lord through love and through faith in Him, because they lived in accordance with His commandments.</td></tr><tr><td>These were redeemed from among men,</td><td>The same here as before [verse 3] .</td></tr><tr><td>being firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.</td><td>The commencement of a Christian heaven that acknowledges one God in whom is the Trinity, and acknowledges that the Lord is that God.</td></tr><tr><td>5. And in their mouth was found no deceit,</td><td>They do not speak with cunning or with a purpose to persuade people of falsity and evil,</td></tr><tr><td>for they are without blemish before the throne of God.</td><td>because they are governed by truths springing from goodness from the Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>6. Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth</td><td>An announcement of the Lord's advent, and of a new church to descend from Him out of heaven,</td></tr><tr><td>- to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people -</td><td>to all people who, owing to religion, are prompted by goods, and owing to doctrine are guided by truths.</td></tr><tr><td>7. saying with a loud voice, "Fear God</td><td>An admonition not to do evil, because it is to act against the Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come;</td><td>An acknowledgment and confession that all the Word's truth comes from the Lord, and that everyone will be judged in accordance with it,</td></tr><tr><td>and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water."</td><td>and that the Lord alone is to be worshiped, because He alone is the Creator, Savior, and Redeemer, and because the angelic heaven and the church and everything in them originate from Him alone.</td></tr><tr><td>8. And another angel followed, saying, "Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city,</td><td>The Roman Catholic religion has now been dispelled with respect to its dogmas and doctrines,</td></tr><tr><td>because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her licentiousness."</td><td>because by profanations of the Word and adulterations of the church's goodness and truth, it has led astray all the people it was able to bring under its dominion.</td></tr><tr><td>9. Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice,</td><td>Still more from the Lord concerning people caught up in faith divorced from charity.</td></tr><tr><td>"If anyone worships the beast and its image, and receives its mark on his forehead or on his hand,</td><td>People who acknowledge and accept the doctrine of justification and salvation by faith alone, affirm it, and live in accordance with it,</td></tr><tr><td>10. he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed with pure wine in the cup of His indignation.</td><td>falsify the Word's goods and truths and steep themselves in a life in accordance with their falsification of them.</td></tr><tr><td>He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. 11. And the smoke of their torment will ascend forever and ever;</td><td>Their love of self and the world and the ensuing lusts, and stemming from these a conceit in their own intelligence, and torment in hell because of them.</td></tr><tr><td>and they will have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name."</td><td>The continuing state of vexations in people who acknowledge and accept that faith, affirm it, and live in accordance with it.</td></tr><tr><td>12. Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.</td><td>By temptations or trials induced by vexations, a person belonging to the Lord's church is explored as to his character in respect to his life in accordance with the Word's commandments and to his faith in the Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>13. Then I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, "Write: 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.'�"</td><td>A prediction by the Lord concerning the state of people after death who will belong to His New Church, that they will have eternal life and happiness.</td></tr><tr><td>"Yes," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors,</td><td>The Word's Divine truth teaches that people who afflict their soul therefore and crucify their flesh will have peace in the Lord,</td></tr><tr><td>for their works follow them."</td><td>according as they have loved and believed and so have done and spoken.</td></tr><tr><td>14. Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat One like the Son of Man,</td><td>The Lord in relation to the Word.</td></tr><tr><td>having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.</td><td>The Divine wisdom emanating from His Divine love, and the Divine truth in the Word.</td></tr><tr><td>15. And another angel came out of the temple,</td><td>The angelic heaven.</td></tr><tr><td>crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, "Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the hour has come for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth has dried."</td><td>A supplication by angels in heaven to the Lord to bring things to an end and execute judgment, because the church had now reached its last state.</td></tr><tr><td>16. So He who sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.</td><td>The end of the church, because it no longer had any Divine truth in it.</td></tr><tr><td>17. Then another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</td><td>The heavens of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and the Word's Divine truth in them.</td></tr><tr><td>18. And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire,</td><td>The heavens of the Lord's celestial kingdom, which are prompted by the goodness of love received from the Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes of the vine of the earth,</td><td>The Lord's operation from the goodness of His love through the Word's Divine truth into the works of charity and faith among people belonging to the Christian Church,</td></tr><tr><td>for her grapes are ripe."</td><td>because the Christian Church has reached its last state.</td></tr><tr><td>19. So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vintage of the vine of the earth,</td><td>The end of the present Christian Church.</td></tr><tr><td>and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</td><td>An examination of the character of the people's works, revealing that their works were evil.</td></tr><tr><td>20. And the winepress was trampled outside the city,</td><td>The examination was made in accordance with Divine truths in the Word, to discover the character of the works that flowed from their church's doctrine regarding faith.</td></tr><tr><td>and blood came out of the winepress, up to the horses' bridles,</td><td>The violence done to the Word by their dreadful falsifications of truth, and the consequent understanding of it so closed up that it was scarcely possible for anyone any longer to be taught by it, and so to be led by the Lord through Divine truths,</td></tr><tr><td>for one thousand six hundred furlongs.</td><td>being nothing but the falsities accompanying evil.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>THE EXPOSITION<p><a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">14:1</a> Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand. This symbolizes the Lord now present in a new heaven composed of people in the Christian churches who acknowledged the Lord alone as God of heaven and earth, and had doctrinal truths springing from the goodness of love received from Him through the Word.<p>This and the rest of what is said in this chapter is symbolically meant by "I saw." The Lamb means the Lord in respect to His Divine humanity (no. <a href="269.htm">269</a>). Mount Zion symbolizes a heaven where the inhabitants are people impelled by love toward the Lord, as described below. One hundred and forty-four thousand symbolizes all those people who acknowledge the Lord alone as God of heaven and earth and have doctrinal truths springing from the goodness of love received from Him through the Word (nos. <a href="348.htm">348</a>ff.).<p>We described these people in chapter 7, but there we were told that they were sealed on their foreheads, being thus distinguished and separated from the rest. Here we are now told that they were gathered together and a new heaven formed of them.</p><p>[2] The heaven that is the subject here is a heaven composed of Christians from the time the Lord was in the world, and formed of those who approached the Lord alone and lived in accordance with His commandments in the Word by shunning evils as sins against God.<p>This heaven is the new heaven from which the holy Jerusalem, or New Church, will descend on earth (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-2</a>). The heavens that existed before the Lord's advent are above it and are called the ancient heavens. The people in them also all acknowledge the Lord alone as God of heaven and earth. Those heavens communicate with this new heaven through influx.</p><p>[3] People know that the land of Canaan symbolizes the church, because the Word existed there, and by it the Lord was known. Moreover, in the middle of it was the city of Zion, and below it the city of Jerusalem, both situated on the mountain. Zion and Jerusalem symbolized, therefore, the innermost elements of the church. And because the church in the heavens goes hand in hand with the church on earth, therefore the church in both places is meant by Zion and Jerusalem - Zion meaning the church as to love, and Jerusalem the church as to its accompanying doctrine.<p>The mountain is called Zion, because a mountain symbolizes love (no. <a href="336.htm">336</a>).</p><p>[4] That Mount Zion symbolizes heaven and the church where the Lord is worshiped can be seen from the following passages:<p>I have anointed My King on... Zion. I will declare the decree: ..."You are My Son, today I have begotten You. ...I will give You the nations for Your inheritance...." ...Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and you perish... Blessed are all those who put their trust in Him. (<a href="3927/psalms_2_6.htm">Psalms 2:6-8</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_2_12.htm">12</a>).<p>Get up into the high mountain, O Zion, you who bring good tidings...

(<a href="3927/isaiah_24_23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>)<p>Jehovah loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. Glorious things shall be proclaimed in you, O city of God! ..."This one was born there." ..."All my springs are in you."

(Declared shall be) the name of Jehovah in Zion..., when the peoples are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 612</h4><p>612. THE FOURTEENTH CHAPTER<p>1. And I saw, and behold the Lamb standing upon Mount Zion, and with Him the hundred and forty-four thousand having His Father's Name written on their foreheads.<p>2. And I heard a voice out of heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of loud thunder, and I heard the voice of harpers playing on their harps.<p>3. And they were singing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four animals, and the elders; and no one was able to learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand bought from the earth.<p>4. These are they who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins; these are they who are following the Lamb wherever He goes; these have been bought from among men, the first-fruits to God and the Lamb.<p>5. And in their mouth is found no deceit, for they are spotless before the throne of God.<p>6. And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the eternal gospel to declare (evangelizare) to those dwelling upon the land, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people,<p>7. Saying with a great voice, Fear God and give glory to Him, because the hour of His judgment has come, and adore Him Who has made the heaven and the land and the sea and the fountains of waters.<p>8. And another angel followed, saying, It has fallen, that great city Babylon has fallen, because she has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom.<p>9. And a third angel followed them, saying with a great voice, If anyone adores the beast, and his image, and accepts a mark upon his forehead and hand,<p>10. He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, mixed with undiluted wine in the cup of his growing anger, and shall be tormented with fire and sulphur before the holy angels and before the Lamb.<p>11. And the smoke of their torment shall go up for ages of ages, and they shall not have rest day and night adoring the beast and his image, and if anyone accepts the mark of his name.<p>12. Here <sup>1</sup>is the patience of the saints; here are those keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus Christ. <sup>2</sup><p>13. And I heard a voice out of heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead dying in the Lord from henceforth. Yes indeed, says the spirit, that they may rest from their labours, for their works follow with them.<p>14. And I saw, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud One sitting like the Son of Man, having upon His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.<p>15. And another angel went out of the temple, crying with a great voice to the One sitting upon the cloud, Put forth Thy sickle and reap, for the hour of reaping has come to Thee, because the harvest of the land has dried up.<p>16. And the One sitting upon the cloud put forth His sickle upon the land, and the land was reaped.<p>17. And another angel went out of the temple that is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.<p>18. And another angel went out of the altar, having power over fire, and he cried with a great cry to the one having the sharp sickle, saying, Put forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the vintage of the clusters of the vineyard of the land, for the grapes thereof have ripened.<p>19. And the angel put forth his sickle into the land, and gathered the vintage of the vineyard of the land, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.<p>20. And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood went out of the winepress even up to the horses' bridles, for a thousand six hundred stadia. <sup>3</sup><p>THE SPIRITUAL SENSE<p>THE CONTENTS OF THE WHOLE CHAPTER<p>Concerning the Christian New Heaven: it is described (verses 1-5).<p>Declaration (evangelizatio) concerning the Lord's coming, and the New Church at that time (verses 6-7, 13).<p>An exhortation for them to depart from the faith separated from charity in which the present Church is (verses 9-12).<p>The examination of these, and making manifest that their works are evil (verses 14-20).<p>THE CONTENTS OF EACH OF THE VERSES<p>1. And I saw and behold the Lamb standing upon Mount Zion, and with Him the hundred and forty-four thousand, signifies the Lord now in the New Heaven of Christians who have acknowledged Him as being the God of heaven and earth, and have been in the truths of doctrine from Him by means of the Word.<p>Having His Father's Name [written] upon their foreheads, signifies the acknowledgment of the Divine and of the Lord's Divine Human with them.<p>2. And I heard a voice out of heaven as the voice of many waters, signifies the Lord speaking through the New Heaven out of Divine Truths.<p>And as the voice of loud thunder, signifies and out of Divine Love.<p>And I heard the voice of harpers playing on their harps, signifies a confession of the Lord out of gladness of heart by the spiritual angels in the lower heavens.<p>3. And they were singing as it were a new song before the throne and before the four animals and before the elders, signifies a celebration and glorification of the Lord in His presence and in the presence of the angels of the higher heavens.<p>And no one was able to learn the song, except the hundred and forty-four thousand, signifies that no others from among Christians have been able to understand, and thus to acknowledge out of love and faith, that the Lord Only is the God of heaven and earth, except those who have been received into this New Heaven by the Lord.<p>Bought from the earth, signifies that they are those who were able to be regenerated by the Lord and thus redeemed in the world.<p>4. These are they who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins, signifies that they have not adulterated the truths of the Church and defiled them with untruths of faith, but they have loved truths because they are true.<p>These are they who are following the Lamb wherever He goes, signifies that they have been conjoined to the Lord through love and faith directed to Him, because they have lived in accordance with His precepts.<p>And have been bought from among men, signifies here as before.<p>The first-fruits of God and the Lamb, signifies the initiament of the Christian heaven, acknowledging the One God in Whom is the Trinity, and the Lord as being that God.<p>5. And in their mouth is found no deceit, signifies that they do not from cunning and intention speak and persuade to what is untrue and evil.<p>For they are spotless before the throne of God, signifies because they are in truths derived from good from the Lord.<p>6. And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven having the eternal gospel to declare (evange1izare) to those dwelling upon the land, signifies the announcement of the Lord's coming, and of the New Church going to come down out of heaven from Him.<p>And to every nation and tribe and tongue and people, signifies to all who are in goods as the result of religion, and in truths as the result of doctrine.<p>7. Saying with a great voice, Fear God, signifies a warning not to do evils, because this is against the Lord.<p>And give glory to Him, because the hour of His judgment has Come, signifies the acknowledgment and confession that all the truth of the Word is from the Lord, in accordance with which every man will be judged.<p>And adore Him Who has made the heaven and the land and the sea and the fountains of waters, signifies that the Lord Only ought to be worshipped, because He Only is the Creator, Saviour and Redeemer, and from Him Only do the angelic heaven and the Church and all the things thereof exist.<p>8. And another angel followed saying, It has fallen, that great city Babylon has fallen, signifies that the Roman Catholic form of religion as to its dogmas and doctrinal tenets has now been dispersed.<p>Because she has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom, signifies because by profanations of the Word and by adulterations of the good and truth of the Church it has led astray all whom it has been able to bring under its dominion.<p>9. And a third angel followed them, saying with a great voice, signifies something further from the Lord concerning those who are in faith separated from charity.<p>If anyone adores the beast and his image, and accepts a mark upon his forehead and hand, signifies [that] he who acknowledges and receives the doctrine concerning justification and salvation by faith alone confirms it and lives in accordance with it.<p>10. He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God mixed with undiluted wine in the cup of his growing anger, signifies that they falsify the goods and truths of the Word, and imbue their life with the same when falsified.<p>11. And shall be tormented with fire and sulphur before the holy angels and the Lamb, and the smoke of their torment shall go up for ages of ages, signifies the love of self and the world and the derivative lusts, and the pride of self-intelligence derived therefrom, and torment in hell as the result thereof.<p>And they shall not have rest day and night adoring the beast and his image, and if anyone accepts the mark of his name, signifies a perpetual state in things undelightful in the case of those who acknowledge and receive that faith, confirm it, and live in accordance therewith.<p>12. Here is the patience of the saints, here <sup>4</sup>are those keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, signifies that the man of the Lord's Church is examined by means of temptations from those [in faith separated from charity] as to the quality of his life in accordance with the precepts of the Word and as to faith directed to the Lord.<p>13. And I heard a voice out of heaven saying unto me, [Write,] Blessed are the dead dying in the Lord from henceforth, signifies a prediction from the Lord concerning the state after death of those who will belong to His New Church (e Nova Ecclesia Ipsius erunt), that they will have eternal life and happiness.<p>Yes indeed, says the spirit, that they may rest from their labours, signifies that the Divine Truth of the Word teaches that those who afflict their soul and crucify the flesh on account of this are going to have peace in the Lord.<p>For their works follow with them, signifies according as they have loved and believed and thence done and spoken.<p>14. And I saw and behold a white cloud, and One sitting like the Son of Man Upon the cloud, signifies the Lord as to the Word.<p>Having upon His head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle, signifies the Divine Wisdom out of Divine Love, and the Divine Truth of the Word.<p>15. And another angel went out of the temple, signifies the angelic heaven.<p>Crying with a great voice to the One sitting upon the cloud, Put forth Thy sickle and reap, for the hour of reaping has come to Thee, because the harvest of the land has dried up, signifies the supplication of the angels of heaven to the Lord, that He may make an end and execute judgment because it is now the last state of the Church.<p>16. And the One sitting upon the cloud put forth His sickle, and the land was reaped, signifies the end of the Church because Divine Truth is not there any longer.<p>17. And another angel went out of the temple that is in heaven heal so having a sharp sickle, signifies the heavens of the Lord's Spiritual kingdom and the Divine Truth of the Word will] them<p>18. And another angel went out of the altar, having power over fire, signifies the heavens of the Lord's celestial kingdom which are in the good of love from the Lord.<p>And he cried with a great cry to the one having the sharp sickle, saying Put forth thy sharp sickle and gather the vintage of the clusters of the vineyard of the land, signifies the Lord's operation out of the good of His love by means of the Divine Truth of His Word into the works of charity and faith that are with the men of the Christian Church<p>For the grapes thereof have ripened, signifies because it is the last state of the Christian Church.<p>19. And the angel put forth his sickle into the land, and gathered the vintage of the vineyard of the land, signifies the end of the present Christian Church.<p>And cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God, signifies an examination of the quality of their works that they were evil.<p>20. And the winepress was trodden outside the city, signifies that the examination was made from (ex) the Divine Truths of the Word [to discover] what the works flowing forth from the Church's doctrine of faith were like.<p>And blood went out of the winepress even up to the horses' bridles, signifies the violence inflicted on the Word by means of dreadful falsifications of truth and the understanding so closed up thereby that a man can scarcely any longer be taught, and thus be led by means of Divine Truths by the Lord.<p>For a thousand six hundred stadia, signifies nothing but untruths of evil.<p>THE EXPOSITION<p>[verse 1] 'And 'saw and behold the Lamb standing Upon Mount Zion, and with Him the hundred and forty-four thousand' signifies the Lord now in the New Heaven gathered together out of those in the Christian Churches who have acknowledged the Lord Only as being the God of heaven and earth, and have been in truths of doctrine out of the good of love from Him by means of the Word. By 'I saw' these things are signified also the things that follow in this chapter. By 'the Lamb' is understood the Lord as to the Divine Human (<a href="269.htm">269</a>, <a href="271.htm">271</a>). By 'Mount Zion' is signifies the heaven where those are who are in love directed to the Lord, concerning which [something] follows. By 'the hundred and forty-four thousand' are signified all who acknowledge the Only Lord as being the God of heaven and earth, and are in truths of doctrine out of the good of love from Him by means of the Word (<a href="348.htm">348</a> seq.). These things were treated of in chapter <a href="3927/revelation_7_1.htm">7</a>, but there, that they were 'sealed upon their foreheads and thus distinguished and separated from the rest; here now [it teaches] they have been gathered together into a unit, and that there is a heaven [formed] out of them.</p><p>[2] The heaven of which it treats here is the heaven gathered together out of the Christians from the time of the Lord's being in the world, and from such of them as have approached the Only Lord and lived in accordance with His precepts in the Word, fleeing from evils as sins against God. This heaven is the New Heaven, out of which the Holy Jerusalem, that is, the New Church on earth, will come down (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-2</a>). But the heavens [formed] before the Lord's coming are above it, and are called the ancient heavens. In these also they all acknowledge the Only Lord as being the God of heaven and earth. These heavens communicate with this New Heaven by influx.</p><p>[3] It is known that by 'the land of Canaan' the Church is signified, because the Word was there and by its means the Lord was known. It is also known that in the midst of that [land] was the city of Zion, and below it the city of , Jerusalem, both upon a mountain. Consequently by 'Zion' and 'Jerusalem' the inmost things of the Church were signified; and because the Church in the heavens makes one with the Church on earth (in terris), therefore by 'Zion' and 'Jerusalem' is understood the Church in both worlds (utrobivis), but by 'Zion' the Church as to love and by 'Jerusalem' the Church as to doctrine therefrom. It is termed 'Mount Zion' because by 'a mountain' is signified love (<a href="336.htm">336</a>).</p><p>[4] That by 'Mount Zion' is signified heaven and the Church where the Only Lord is worshipped can be established from the following passages:<p>I have anointed My King upon Zion; I will announce in a decree, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee I will give the nations [for] Thine inheritance.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 612</h4><p>612. Revelation 14<p>1. And I saw, and behold a Lamb standing on the Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred forty-four thousand, having His Father's name written upon their foreheads.<p>2. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of great thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.<p>3. And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four animals, and the elders; and no one was able to learn the song but the hundred forty-four thousand bought from the earth.<p>4. These are they who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins; these are they who follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth: these were bought from among men, the firstfruits to God and the Lamb.<p>5. And in their mouth was found no deceit, for they are spotless before the throne of God.<p>6. And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the eternal gospel to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people;<p>7. Saying with a great voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment is come; and adore Him that made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and the fountains of waters.<p>8. And another angel followed, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the anger of her whoredom.<p>9. And a third angel followed them, saying with a great voice, if anyone hath adored the beast, and his image, and hath received his mark upon his forehead or upon his hand,<p>10. He also shall drink of the wine of the anger of God mixed with unmixed wine in the cup of His wrath, and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb.<p>11. And the smoke of their torment shall go up for ages of ages; and they shall have no rest day and night that adore the beast and his image, and if anyone shall have received the mark of his name.<p>12. Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus Christ. <sup>1</sup><p>13. And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Happy are the dead that die in the Lord from henceforth; yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.<p>14. And I saw, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud One sitting like unto the Son of man, having upon His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.<p>15. And another angel went out from the temple, crying with a great voice to Him that sat on the cloud, Send Thy sickle, and reap; for the hour for Thee to reap is come, for the harvest of the earth is dried up.<p>16. And He that sat upon the cloud sent His sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped.<p>17. And another angel went out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.<p>18. And another angel went out from the altar, having authority over fire; and he cried with a great cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send thy sharp sickle, and gather the vintage, the clusters of the vineyard of the earth; for her grapes are ripened.<p>19. And the angel sent his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vineyard of the earth, and he cast it into the great winepress of the anger of God.<p>20. And the winepress was trodden without the city; and there went out blood from the winepress even unto the bridles of the horses, for a thousand six hundred stadia.<p>THE SPIRITUAL SENSE<p>The contents of the whole chapter<p>Concerning the New Christian Heaven: it is described (verses <a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">1-5</a>). The proclamation of the Lord's coming, and then the New Church (verses <a href="3927/revelation_14_6.htm">6-7</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_14_13.htm">13</a>). An exhortation to recede from faith separated from charity, in which is the church at the present day (verses <a href="3927/revelation_14_9.htm">9-12</a>). The exploration of these, and the manifestation that their works are evil (verses <a href="3927/revelation_14_14.htm">14-20</a>).<p>The contents of each verse<p>Verse 1. "And I saw, and behold a Lamb standing on the Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred forty-four <sup>2</sup>thousand," signifies the Lord now in the New Heaven from Christians, who acknowledged Him as the God of heaven and earth, and were in truths of doctrine from Him through the Word, (<a href="612.htm">612</a>). "Having His Father's name in their foreheads," signifies acknowledgment of the Lord's Divine and the Divine Human with them, (<a href="613.htm">613</a>).<p>Verse 2. "And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters," signifies the Lord speaking through the New Heaven from Divine truths, (<a href="614.htm">614</a>). "And as the voice of great thunder," signifies and from the Divine love, (<a href="615.htm">615</a>). "And I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps," signifies confession of the Lord from gladness of heart by the spiritual angels in the lower heavens, (<a href="616.htm">616</a>).<p>Verse 3. "And they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four animals and before the elders," signifies celebration and glorification of the Lord before Him and before the angels of the higher heavens, (<a href="617.htm">617</a>). "And no one was able to learn the song but the hundred forty-four thousand," signifies that no others from among Christians could understand, and thus from love and faith acknowledge, that the Lord alone is the God of heaven and earth, but they who were received by the Lord into this New Heaven, (<a href="618.htm">618</a>). "Bought from the earth," signifies that they are those who could be regenerated by the Lord and thus be redeemed in the world, (<a href="619.htm">619</a>). Vers, (<a href="3927/revelation_14_4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a>) e 4. "These are they who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins," signifies that they did not adulterate the truths of the church, and defile them with falsities of faith, but that they loved truths because they are truths, (<a href="620.htm">620</a>). "These are they who follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth," signifies that they are conjoined with the Lord by love and faith in Him, because they have lived according to His commandments, (<a href="621.htm">621</a>). "And were bought from among men," signifies here as before, (<a href="622.htm">622</a>). "Firstfruits unto God and the Lamb," signifies the first beginning of the Christian heaven, that acknowledges one God in whom is the Trinity, and that the Lord is He, (<a href="623.htm">623</a>).<p>Verse 5. "And in their mouth was found no deceit," signifies that they do not from cunning and design speak and persuade to falsity and evil, (<a href="624.htm">624</a>). "For they are spotless before the throne of God," signifies because they are in truths from good from the Lord, (<a href="625.htm">625</a>).<p>Verse 6. "And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven having the eternal gospel to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth," signifies the annunciation of the Lord's coming, and of the New Church that is to come down out of heaven from Him, (<a href="626.htm">626</a>). "And to every nation and tribe and tongue and people," signifies to all who are in goods from religion, and in truths from doctrine, (<a href="627.htm">627</a>).<p>Verse 7. "Saying with a great voice, Fear God," signifies admonition not to do evils, because this is against the Lord, (<a href="628.htm">628</a>). "And give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment is come," signifies the acknowledgment and confession that all the truth of the Word is from the Lord, according to which every man will be judged, (<a href="629.htm">629</a>[1-2]); "and adore Him who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and the fountains of waters," signifies that the Lord alone is to be worshiped, because He alone is the Creator, Saviour, and Redeemer, and from Him alone are the angelic heaven and the church and all things of them, (<a href="630.htm">630</a>).<p>Verse 8. (<a href="3927/revelation_14_8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>) "And another angel followed, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city," signifies that the Roman Catholic religion, as to its dogmas and doctrinals, is now dispersed, (<a href="631.htm">631</a>). "Because she made all nations drink of the wine of the anger of her whoredom," signifies because by profanations of the Word and adulterations of the good and truth of the church, she has seduced all whom she could subject to her dominion, (<a href="632.htm">632</a>).<p>Verse 9. (<a href="3927/revelation_14_9.htm">Revelation 14:9</a>) "And a third angel followed them, saying with a great voice," signifies further revelation from the Lord concerning those who are in faith separated from charity, (<a href="633.htm">633</a>). "If anyone hath adored the beast and his image, and hath received his mark upon his forehead and upon his hand," signifies whoever acknowledges and receives the doctrine concerning justification and salvation by faith alone, confirms it, and lives according to it, (<a href="634.htm">634</a>).<p>Verse 10. "He also shall drink of the wine of the anger of God mixed with unmixed wine in the cup of His wrath," signifies that they falsify the goods and truths of the Word, and imbue their life from those falsified things, (<a href="635.htm">635</a>). "And he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels and the Lamb (verse <a href="3927/revelation_14_11.htm">11</a>), and the smoke of their torment shall go up for ages of ages," signifies the love of self and the world and the lusts therefrom, and from these the pride of their own intelligence, and thence torment in hell, (<a href="636.htm">636</a>). "And they shall have no rest day and night that adore the beast and his image, and if anyone shall have received the mark of his name," signifies a perpetual state in undelightful things with those who acknowledge and receive that faith, confirm it, and live according to it, (<a href="637.htm">637</a>).<p>Verse 12. "Here is the patience of the saints, here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus," signifies that the man of the Lord's church is explored by temptations from them, as to the quality of his life according to the commandments of the Word and of his faith in the Lord, (<a href="638.htm">638</a>).<p>Verse 13. "And I heard a voice from heaven, saying to me, Write, <sup>3</sup>Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord from henceforth," signifies a prediction from the Lord concerning the state of those after death who will be of His New Church, that they will have eternal life and happiness, (<a href="639.htm">639</a>). "Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors," signifies that the Divine truth of the Word teaches that they who afflict their soul and crucify their flesh for the sake of those things, will have peace in the Lord, (<a href="640.htm">640</a>). "For their works follow with them," signifies according as they have loved and believed, and thence have done and spoken, (<a href="641.htm">641</a>).<p>Verse 14. "And I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and upon the cloud One sitting like unto the Son of man," signifies the Lord as to the Word, (<a href="642.htm">642</a>). "Having upon His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle," signifies the Divine wisdom from His Divine love, and the Divine truth of the Word, (<a href="643.htm">643</a>).<p>Verse 15. "And another angel went out from the temple," signifies the angelic heaven, (<a href="644.htm">644</a>). "Crying with a great voice to Him that sat on the cloud, Send Thy sickle, and reap, for the hour for Thee to reap is come, for the harvest of the earth is dried up," signifies the supplication of the angels of heaven to the Lord, that He would make an end and execute judgment, because now is the last state of the church, (<a href="645.htm">645</a>).<p>Verse 16. "And He that sat upon the cloud sent His sickle, and the earth was reaped," signifies the end of the church, because there is no longer any Divine truth there, (<a href="646.htm">646</a>).<p>Verse 17. "And another angel went out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle," signifies the heavens of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and the Divine truth of the Word with them, (<a href="647.htm">647</a>).<p>Verse 18. "And another angel went out from the altar, having authority over fire," signifies the heavens of the Lord's celestial kingdom, which are in the good of love from the Lord, (<a href="648.htm">648</a>). "And he cried with a great cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send thy sharp sickle, and gather the vintage, the clusters of the vineyard of the earth," signifies the Lord's operation from the good of His love by the Divine truth of His Word into the works of charity and faith, with the men of the Christian church, (<a href="649.htm">649</a>). "For her grapes are ripened," signifies because it is the last state of the Christian church, (<a href="649.htm">649</a>b). Verse <a href="3927/revelation_14_19.htm">19</a>. "And the angel sent his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vineyard of the earth," signifies the end of the present Christian church, (<a href="650.htm">650</a>). "And he cast it into the great winepress of the anger of God," signifies exploration of the quality of their works, that they were evil, (<a href="651.htm">651</a>).<p>Verse 20. "And the winepress was trodden without the city," signifies that exploration was made from the Divine truths of the Word as to the quality of the works which flow forth from the doctrine of faith of the church, (<a href="652.htm">652</a>). "And there went out blood from the winepress even unto the bridles of the horses," signifies violence done to the Word by dreadful falsifications of the truth, and the understanding so closed up thereby, that man can scarcely be taught any longer, and thus be led of the Lord by Divine truths, (<a href="653.htm">653</a>). "For a thousand six hundred stadia," signifies mere falsities of evil, (<a href="654.htm">654</a>).<p>THE EXPLANATION<p>Verse 1. And I saw, and behold a Lamb standing on the Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred forty-four thousand, signifies the Lord now in the New Heaven collected out of those in the Christian churches who have acknowledged the Lord alone to be the God of heaven and earth, and have been in the truths of doctrine from the good of love from Him by the Word. By "I saw," are signified the things which follow in this chapter; by "a Lamb" is meant the Lord as to the Divine Human, (<a href="269.htm">269</a>, <a href="271.htm">271</a>); by "mount Zion" is signified heaven, where they are who are in love to the Lord, as will be seen presently; by "a hundred forty-four thousand" are signified all who acknowledge the Lord alone to be the God of heaven and earth, and who are in the truths of doctrine from the good of love from Him through the Word, (<a href="348.htm">348</a>). These were treated of in chapter 7; but there, that "they were sealed on their foreheads," and thus were distinguished and separated from the rest; now however that they were collected together into one, and that a heaven was from them.</p><p>[2] The heaven here treated of, is the heaven collected from Christians, from the time the Lord was in the world, and from such of them as approached the Lord alone, and lived according to His precepts in the Word, by shunning evils as sins against God. This heaven is the New Heaven, from which the Holy Jerusalem, that is, the New Church upon earth, will descend, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-2</a>). But the heavens which were formed before the Lord's coming are above this heaven, and are called the ancient heavens; in which likewise all acknowledge the Lord alone to be the God of heaven and earth. These heavens communicate with this New Heaven by influx.</p><p>[3] It is known, that by "the land of Canaan" is signified the church, because the Word was there, and by it the Lord was known; also because in the midst of it was the city Zion, and under it the city Jerusalem, both upon a mountain. Hence by "Zion" and "Jerusalem" are signified the inmost things of the church; and as the church in the heavens makes one with the church on earth, therefore by "Zion" and "Jerusalem" is meant the church everywhere, but by "Zion" the church as to love, and by "Jerusalem" the church as to doctrine from love. It is called "Mount Zion" because by "a mountain" is signified love, (<a href="336.htm">336</a>[1-4]).</p><p>[4] That by "Mount Zion" is signified heaven and the church where the Lord alone is worshiped, may appear from the following passages:<p>I have anointed My King upon Zion; I will announce concerning the statute, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee; I will give the nations for Thy inheritance; Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and ye perish; happy are all that trust in Him, (<a href="3927/psalms_2_6.htm">Psalms 2:6-8</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_2_12.htm">12</a>).<p>O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; say, Behold the Lord Jehovah will come in strength, (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_9.htm">Isaiah 40:9-10</a>).<p>Exult greatly, O daughter of Zion; behold thy King cometh unto thee Just and a Savior, (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_21_2.htm">Matthew 21:2</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_21_4.htm">4-5</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_14.htm">John 12:14-15</a>).<p>Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee, (<a href="3927/isaiah_12_6.htm">Isaiah 12:6</a>).<p>The redeemed of Jehovah shall return to Zion with a song, (<a href="3927/isaiah_35_10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>).<p>Shout and be glad, O daughter of Zion, behold I come that I may dwell in the midst of thee, (<a href="3927/zechariah_2_10.htm">Zechariah 2:10-11</a>).<p>Who will give the salvation of Israel in Zion, (<a href="3927/psalms_14_7.htm">Psalms 14:7</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_53_6.htm">53:6</a>).<p>The Lord Jehovih will found in Zion a tried stone, and then shall your covenant with death be abolished, (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_16.htm">Isaiah 28:16-18</a>).<p>My salvation shall not tarry, I will give salvation in Zion, (<a href="3927/isaiah_46_13.htm">Isaiah 46:13</a>).<p>Then the Redeemer shall come to Zion, (<a href="3927/isaiah_59_20.htm">Isaiah 59:20</a>).<p>Jehovah of Hosts shall reign in Mount Zion, (<a href="3927/isaiah_24_23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>).<p>Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob; glorious things are to be proclaimed in thee, O city of God; this one was born there; all my fountains are in thee, (<a href="3927/psalms_87_2.htm">Psalms 87:2-3</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_87_6.htm">6-7</a>).<p>Jehovah hath chosen Zion, He hath desired it for His seat; this is my rest forever, there will I dwell, (<a href="3927/psalms_132_13.htm">Psalms 132:13-14</a>).<p>Let the sons of Zion exult in their King, (<a href="3927/psalms_149_2.htm">Psalms 149:2</a>).<p>O Jehovah arise, and have mercy on Zion, the set time is come; the name of Jehovah shall be declared in Zion, when the peoples are gathered together, and the kingdoms to serve Jehovah, (<a href="3927/psalms_102_13.htm">Psalms 102:13-16</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_102_21.htm">21-22</a>).<p>Out of Zion God shall shine; our God cometh, and shall call to the heaven above, and to the earth, Gather My saints together unto Me, (<a href="3927/psalms_50_2.htm">Psalms 50:2-5</a>).

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 612 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>612. CAPUT XIV. <p>ET Vidi, et ecce Agnus stans super Monte Sion, et cum Ipso centum quadraginta quatuor millia, habentes nomen Patris Ipsius Scriptum Super frontibus Suis. <p>2. Et audivi vocem e Caelo, tanquam vocem aquarum multarum, et tanquam vocem tonitrui magni, et vocem audivi citharaedorum pulsantium citharis suis. <p>3. Et canebant tanquam Canticum novum coram Throno, et coram quatuor Animalibus, et Senioribus; et nemo potuit discere Canticum, nisi quam illi centum quadraginta quatuor millia, empti de terra. <p>4. Hi Sunt qui cum mulieribus non sunt inquinati, Virgines enim sunt; hi Sunt qui, sequentes Agnum quocunque vadit: hi empti sunt de hominibus, primitiae Deo et Agno. <p>5. Et in ore illorum non est inventus dolus, immaculati enim Sunt coram Throno Dei. <p>6. Et vidi alium Angelum volantem in medio Caeli, habentem Evangelium aeternum evangelizare habitantibus super terra, et omni genti et tribui et linguae et populo; <p>7. Dicentem voce magna, Timete Deum, et date Ipsi gloriam, quia venit hora judicii Ipsius, et adorate Ipsum Qui fecit Caelum et Terram et Mare et Fontes aquarum. <p>8. Et alius Angelus secutus est, dicens, Cecidit, cecidit Babylon, urbs illa magna, quia ex vino irae scortationis Suae potavit omnes gentes. <p>9. Et tertius Angelus secutus est illos, dicens voce magna. Si quis Bestiam adoraverit, et imaginem ejus, et acceperit characterem super fronte sua et super manu sua, <p>10. Et ille bibet ex vino irae Dei mixto mero in poculo excandescentiae Ipsius, et cruciabitur igne et sulphure coram sanctis Angelis et coram Agno. <p>11. Et fumus cruciatus illorum ascendet in saecula saeculorum, et non habebunt requiem diu et noctu adorantes Bestiam et imaginem ejus, et si quis acceperit characterem nominis ejus. <p>12. Hic <sup>1</sup>patientia sanctorum est, hic custodientes mandata Dei et fidem Jesu Christi. <p>13. Et audivi vocem e Caelo dicentem mihi, Scribe, Beati mortui in Domino morientes a nunc; imo dicit Spiritus, ut requiescant ex laboribus suis, opera enim illorum sequuntur cum illis. <p>14. Et vidi, et ecce nubes alba, et super nube Sedens similis Filio Hominis, habens super capite Suo coronam auream, et in manu Sua falcem acutam. <p>15. Et alius Angelus exivit e Templo, clamans magna voce Sedenti super nube, Mitte falcem Tuam et mete, quia venit Tibi hora metendi, quia aruit messis terrae. <p>16. Et misit Sedens super nube falcem Suam super terram, et demessa est terra. <p>17. Et alius Angelus exivit e Templo quod in Caelo, habens et ille falcem acutam. <p>18. Et alius Angelus exivit ex Altari, habens potestatem super ignem, et clamavit clamore magno habenti falcem acutam, dicens, Mitte tuam falcem acutam, et vindemia botros Vineae terrae, quia maturuerunt uvae ejus. <p>19. Et misit Angelus falcem suam in terram, et vindemiavit vineam terrae, et conjecit in torcular irae Dei magnum. <p>20. Et calcatum est torcular extra urbem, et exivit Sanguis e torculari usque ad frena equorum, a stadiis mille sexcenti. <p>SENSUS SPIRITUALIS. <p>CONTENTUM TOTIUS CAPITIS. <p>DE NOVO CAELO CHRISTIANO (describitur vers. 1-5);<p>EVANGELIZATIO DE ADVENTU DOMINI, ET TUNC NOVA ECCLESIA (vers. 6, 7, 13);<p>EXHORTATIO UT RECEDANT A FIDE SEPARATA A CHARITATE, IN QUA EST HODIERNA ECCLESIA (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_612/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_9" target=_top>9-12</a>);<p>EXPLORATIO HORUM, ET MANIFESTATIO, QUOD OPERA ILLORUM SINT MALA (vers. 14-20).<p>CONTENTA SINGULORUM VERSUUM. <p>1.
