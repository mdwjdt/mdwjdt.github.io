<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第414节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>414.“白昼的三分之一部分没有光，黑夜也是这样”表他们里面不再有任何来自圣言、服务于教义和生活的属灵真理和属世真理。“白昼没有光”表示没有来自太阳的光；“黑夜也是这样”表示没有来自月亮和星辰的光。“光”总体上表示神性真理，也就是来自圣言的真理；“太阳的光”表示属灵的神性真理；“月亮和星辰的光”表示属世的神性真理，二者皆来自圣言。就圣言的属灵之义而言，神性真理如同白天的日光；就圣言的属世之义而言，则如同夜间月亮和星辰的光。圣言的属灵之义也流入它的属世之义，正如太阳及其光流入月亮，月亮则间接反射阳光。圣言的属灵之义以同样的方式光照世人，哪怕那些以属世之义来阅读圣言时，对此毫不知情的人；不过，它启示属灵人，犹如阳光照进眼睛；启示属世人，则犹如月光和星光照进眼睛。人皆照着对真理与良善的情感，同时照着藉以开启他的理性功能的纯正真理而被启示。</p><p>在以下经文中，“昼”与“夜”所表相同：</p><p>神说，天上穹苍中要有光体，可以分昼夜；于是神造了两个大光，大光体管昼，小光体管夜，又造众星。神还把这些光摆列在天上穹苍中，管理昼夜，分别明暗。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创1.14.htm">1:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创1.19.htm">19</a>）</p><p>耶和华造了大光体，日头管白昼，又造月亮星宿管黑夜。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗136.7.htm">136:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗136.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>耶和华啊，白昼属你，黑夜也属你；你已预备亮光和日头。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗74.16.htm">74:16</a>）</p><p>耶和华使太阳白日发光，使星月有定律，黑夜发亮。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.35.htm">31:35</a>）</p><p>你们若能废弃我所立白日的约、黑夜的约，使白日黑夜不按时轮转，我与我仆人大卫所立的约就必失效；若是我立白日黑夜的约不能存住，若是我未曾安排天地的定例，我也将弃绝雅各的种和大卫的种。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.20.htm">33:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.25.htm">25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.26.htm">26</a>）</p><p>引用这些经文，是叫人知道，所表示的是这两种光变暗。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 414</h4><p>414. So that a third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night. This symbolically means that they no longer have in them any spiritual truth or natural truth from the Word serviceable for doctrine and life.<p>The day's not shining means that they had no light from the sun, and "likewise the night" means that they had no light from the moon and stars. Light in general symbolizes Divine truth, which is truth from the Word. The light of the sun symbolizes spiritual Divine truth, and the light of the moon and stars symbolizes natural Divine truth, both acquired from the Word. Divine truth in the spiritual sense of the Word is like the light of the sun during the day, and Divine truth in the natural sense of the Word is like the light of the moon and stars at night. The spiritual sense of the Word, moreover, flows into its natural sense, as the sun does with its light to the moon, and this reflects the light of the sun indirectly.<p>In this way also does the spiritual sense of the Word enlighten people, even people who know nothing of that sense, when they read the Word in its natural sense. However, it enlightens a spiritual person as light from the sun does his eye, but a natural person as light from the moon and stars does his eye. Everyone is enlightened in accordance with his spiritual affection for truth and goodness, and at the same time in accordance with the genuine truths by which he has opened his rational faculty.</p><p>[2] Day and night also have this meaning in the following places:<p>God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night...." Then God made two great lights: the greater light to rule by day, and the lesser light to rule by night. He made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth, and to rule by day and by night, and to divide the light from the darkness. (<a href="3927/genesis_1_14.htm">Genesis 1:14-19</a>)<p>(Jehovah) made great lights..., the sun to rule by day..., the moon and stars to rule by night... (<a href="3927/psalms_136_7.htm">Psalms 136:7-9</a>)<p>The day is Yours, (O Jehovah,) the night also is Yours; You have prepared the light and the sun. (<a href="3927/psalms_74_16.htm">Psalms 74:16</a>)<p>...Jehovah... gives the sun for a light by day, the ordinances of the moon and the stars for a light by night... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>)<p>If you can break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night, so that there will not be day and night in their season, then My covenant also may be broken with David My servant... If I have not appointed My covenant with day and night, the ordinances of heaven and earth, I also will reject the offspring of Jacob and David... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_33_20.htm">Jeremiah 33:20-21</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_25.htm">25-26</a>)<p>I cite these passages to make known that the darkening of both kinds of light is meant. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 414</h4><p>414. 'So that the day should not shine for a third part of it, and the night likewise' signifies no longer any spiritual truth nor natural truth serviceable for doctrine and life out of the Word with them. By 'that the day should not shine' is understood no light derived from the sun, and by 'the night likewise' not shining is understood no light derived from the moon and the stars. By light in general is signified Divine Truth, which is Truth out of the Word: by the light of the sun spiritual Divine Truth, and by the light of the moon and the stars natural Divine Truth, both out of the Word. Divine Truth in the spiritual sense of the Word is like the light of the sun by day, and Divine Truth in the natural sense of the Word is like the light of the moon and stars by night. Indeed, the spiritual sense of the Word inflows into the natural sense thereof as the sun does with its own light into the moon, and causes it to appear in a mediate manner. In this manner also does the spiritual sense of the Word enlighten men, even those who do not know anything about that sense, while they are reading the Word in the natural sense. It, however, enlightens a spiritual man as the light from the sun enlightens his eye, but a natural man as the light derived from the moon and stars does his eye. Each one is enlightened in accordance with the spiritual affection of truth and good, and at the same time in accordance with the genuine truths by means of which he has opened his rational.</p><p>[2] These things are understood by 'day' and 'night' also in the following passages:<p>God said, Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens, to distinguish between the day and the night: and God made two great luminaries, a great luminary to rule in the day, and a lesser luminary to rule in the night, and the stars: and God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth, and to rule in the day and in the night, and to distinguish between the light and the darkness. <a href="3927/genesis_1_14.htm">Genesis 1:14-19</a>.<p>Jehovah made great luminaries, the sun for dominion in the day, and the moon and stars for dominion in the night. <a href="3927/psalms_136_7.htm">Psalms 136:7-9</a>.<p>To Thee, O Jehovah, is the day, and to Thee the night, Thou hast prepared the light and the sun. <a href="3927/psalms_74_16.htm">Psalms 74:16</a>.<p>Jehovah giving the sun for the light of the day, the statutes of the moon and stars for the light of the night. <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>.<p>If you render My covenant of the day and My covenant of the night of no effect, so that there be not day and night in their season, My covenant also with David My servant shall become of no effect: if I do not set My covenant of the day and night, the statutes of heaven and earth, I shall also disapprove the seed of Jacob and of David. <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_20.htm">Jeremiah 33:20-21</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_25.htm">25-26</a>.<p>These passages have been quoted so that it may be known that the darkening of both the lights [spiritual and natural] is understood. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 414</h4><p>414. That the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise, signifies that there is no longer any spiritual truth nor natural truth serving for doctrine and life from the Word with them. By "the day not shining," is meant that there was no light from the sun; and by "no night likewise," is meant that there was no light from the moon and stars. By "light," in general, is signified the Divine truth, which is truth from the Word; by "the light of the sun," Divine truth spiritual; and by the light of the moon and stars, the Divine truth natural, both from the Word. The Divine truth, in the spiritual sense of the Word, is like the light of the sun by day; and the Divine truth in the natural sense of the Word, is like the light of the moon and stars by night. The spiritual sense of the Word also flows into its natural sense as the sun does with its light into the moon, which gives forth the light of the sun in a mediate manner. In the same way does the spiritual sense of the Word enlighten men, even those who know nothing at all concerning it, whilst they read the Word in its natural sense; but it enlightens the spiritual man, as the sun's light does the eye; but the natural man, as the light of the moon and stars enlighten his eye. Everyone is enlightened according to the spiritual affection of truth and good, and at the same time according to genuine truths, by which he has opened his rational faculty.</p><p>[2] The same is meant by "day" and "night," in the following passages:<p>And God said, Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to distinguish between the day and the night; and God made two great luminaries, the great luminary to rule in the day, and the lesser luminary to rule in the night; and the stars: And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth, and to rule in the day and in the night, and to distinguish between the light and the darkness, (<a href="3927/genesis_1_14.htm">Genesis 1:14-19</a>).<p>Jehovah made great luminaries, the sun to rule in the day, the moon and stars to rule in the night, (<a href="3927/psalms_136_7.htm">Psalms 136:7-9</a>).<p>To Thee, O Jehovah, is the day, and to Thee the night; Thou hast prepared the light and the sun, (<a href="3927/psalms_74_16.htm">Psalms 74:16</a>).<p>Jehovah that giveth the sun for the light of the day, the statutes of the moon and stars for the light of the night, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>).<p>If ye can make void My covenant of the day and My covenant of the night, that there should not be day and night in their season, My covenant also with David My servant shall be made void; if I have not set My covenant of the day and of the night, the statutes of heaven and earth, I will also reject the seed of Jacob and of David, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_33_20.htm">Jeremiah 33:20-21</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_25.htm">25-26</a>).<p>These are adduced, that it may be known that the darkening of both kinds of light is meant. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 414 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>414. "Ut dies non luceret tertia parte ejus et nox similiter," significat non amplius aliquod verum spirituale nec verum naturale inserviens pro doctrina et vita ex Verbo apud illos. - Per quod "dies non luceret" intelligitur quod non lux ex sole; et per quod "non nox similiter" intelligitur quod non lux ex luna et stellis: per "lucem" in genere significatur Divinum Verum, quod est Verum ex Verbo; per "lucem solis" Divinum Verum spirituale, et per "lucem lunae et stellarum" Divinum Verum naturale, utrumque ex Verbo; Divinum Verum in Sensu spirituali Verbi est sicut lux solis in die, et Divinum Verum in Sensu naturali Verbi est sicut lux lunae et stellarum in nocte; influit etiam Sensus spiritualis Verbi in Sensum naturalem ejus, sicut sol cum luce sua in lunam, et sistit lucem solis mediate: ita quoque Sensus spiritualis Verbi illustrat homines, etiam illos qui non sciunt aliquid de illo Sensu, dum legunt Verbum in Sensu naturali; sed hominem spiritualem sicut lux a sole oculum ejus, hominem autem naturalem sicut lux ex luna et stellis oculum ejus; unusquisque illustratur secundum affectionem spiritualem veri et boni, et simul secundum genuina vera, per quae rationale suum aperuit. Haec per "diem" et "noctem" etiam intelliguntur in sequentibus locis: <p>"Dixit Deus, sint Luminaria in expanso caelorum, ad distinguendum inter Diem et inter Noctem: et fecit Deus duo Luminaria magna, Luminare magnum ad dominandum in Die, et Luminare minus ad dominandum in Nocte, et Stellas et posuit illa Deus in expanso caelorum, ad Lucem dandum super terra, et ad dominandum in Die et in Nocte, et ad distinguendum inter Lucem et inter Tenebras," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_414/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_1_14-19" target=_top>Genesis 1:14-19</a>);<p>Jehovah "fecit Luminaria magna, Solem in dominium in Die, Lunam et Stellas in dominium in Nocte," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_414/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_136_7-9" target=_top>Psalm 136:7-9</a>);<p>"Tibi Jehovah Dies et Tibi Nox, Tu praeparasti Lucem et Solem," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_414/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_74_16" target=_top>Psalm 74:16</a>);<p>"Jehovah dans Solem in lucem Diei, statuta Lunae et Stellarum in lucem Noctis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_414/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_31_35" target=_top>Jeremias 31:35</a>);<p>"Si irritum reddideritis foedus Meum Diei et foedus Meum Noctis, ut non sit Dies et Nox in tempore suo, etiam foedus Meum irritum fiet cum Davide servo Meo; si non foedus Meum Diei et Noctis statuta Caeli et Terrae, posuero, etiam semen Jacobi et Davidis reprobarem," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_414/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_33_20-21" target=_top>Jeremias 33:20-21</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_414/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_33_25-26" target=_top>25-26</a>);<p>haec allata sunt, ut sciatur quod intelligatur obtenebratio utriusque lucis. </p>
