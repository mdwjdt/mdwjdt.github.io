<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第915节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>915.启21:19，20.“第一根基是碧玉，第二是蓝宝石，第三是绿玛瑙，第四是绿宝石，第五是红玛瑙，第六是红宝石，第七是橄榄石，第八是绿柱石，第九是黄玉，第十是绿玉，第十一是紫玛瑙，第十二是紫晶”表在那些直接靠近主，并通过避恶如罪照十诫生活的人当中，源于圣言字义的该教义井然有序的全部事物；因为是这些人而非其他人处于爱神爱邻教义，爱神爱邻是宗教信仰的两大根基。“墙的十二根基”表示源于圣言字义的新耶路撒冷教义的全部事物（<a href="902.htm">902</a>，<a href="914.htm">914</a>节）；“宝石”总体上表示源于圣言、凭灵义而透明的一切教义真理（<a href="231.htm">231</a>，<a href="540.htm">540</a>，<a href="726.htm">726</a>，<a href="911.htm">911</a>，<a href="914.htm">914</a>节）。此处每一种宝石都表示某种同样透明的具体真理。就其教义而言，字义中的圣言对应于各种宝石，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/43.htm">43</a>-45节）。</p><p>宝石总体上发出两种颜色，即红色和亮白色。其它颜色，如绿色、黄色和天蓝色等等，都是由这两种颜色调以黑色而构成的；红色表示爱之良善，亮白色表示智慧之真理。红色之所以表示爱之良善，是因为它来源于太阳之火，灵界太阳之火本质上是主的神性之爱，因而是爱之良善；亮白色之所以表示智慧之真理，是因为它来源于灵界太阳之火所发之光，所发之光本质上是神性智慧，因而是智慧之真理；黑色来源于火与光的阴影，也就是无知。</p><p>不过，要详细解释每样宝石表示哪种良善和哪种真理，将过于冗长。尽管如此，要了解照这种次序所列举的任意一种宝石表示哪种良善和真理，可参看前面的解释（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.5.htm">7:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.8.htm">8</a>，｛349-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.361.htm">361</a>节），那里论述了以色列的十二个支派。此处每种宝石和那里所提到的每个支派所表相同，因为那里所描述的十二支派同样表示教会及其教义井然有序的一切良善与真理；因此，在本章（｛21:14）经上说 “十二根基上有羔羊十二使徒的名字”；“十二使徒”表示关于主和遵行其诫命之生活的教义全部事物（<a href="903.htm">903</a>节）。这十二样宝石与被称乌陵和土明的亚伦胸牌中的十二块宝石所表相同（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.15.htm">28:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.21.htm">21</a>），有关它们的细节可参看《天堂的奥秘》（<a href="../ac/9856.htm">9856</a>-<a href="../ac/9882.htm">9882</a>节）一书的解读；不同之处在于，后者上面有以色列十二支派的名字，而前者上面有羔羊十二使徒的名字。</p><p>根基由宝石构成，这在以赛亚书也提到过：</p><p>你这受困苦的人啊，看哪，我必以彩色安置你的石头，以蓝宝石立定你的根基，以红宝石造你的城门；你的儿女都要受耶和华的教训。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.11.htm">54:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>“受困苦的”表示主在外邦人当中建立的教会。同一先知书：</p><p>主耶和华如此说，我在锡安放一块石头作为根基，是试验过的石头，是稳固根基、宝贵的房角石；我必以公平为准绳，以公义为线铊。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.16.htm">28:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.17.htm">17</a>）</p><p>由于源于圣言的一切教义真理都建立在对主的承认上，所以主被称为“以色列的磐石”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.24.htm">49:24</a>）；“匠人所弃的房角石”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.42.htm">21:42</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.10.htm">12:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.11.htm">11</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.17.htm">20:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.18.htm">18</a>）。房角石是“根基石”，这一点从耶利米书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.26.htm">51:26</a>）明显可知。在圣言的许多地方，主也被称为“磐石”，因此祂以“磐石”来指自己，当时祂说：</p><p>我要把我的教会建造在这磐石上。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.18.htm">16:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.19.htm">19</a>）</p><p>还说：</p><p>凡听见我话就去行的，好比一个聪明人，他盖房子，把根基安在磐石上。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.47.htm">6:47</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.48.htm">48</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.24.htm">7:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.25.htm">25</a>）</p><p>“磐石”表示主的圣言神性真理。教会及其教义的全部事物都涉及这二者，即：要直接靠近主，要避恶如罪、照着诫命生活；教义的全部事物都涉及对神之爱和对邻之爱；这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之仁篇》，那里依次阐述了这些事。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 915</h4><p>915. <a href="3927/revelation_21_20.htm">21:20</a> The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. This symbolizes all of the doctrines of the New Church from the Word's literal sense in their order, with those who turn directly to the Lord and live in accordance with the Ten Commandments by refraining from evils as being sins; for they and no others possess a doctrine of love toward God and love for the neighbor, which are the two foundations of religion.<p>The twelve foundations of the wall symbolize all the doctrines of the New Jerusalem from the literal sense of the Word, as may be seen in nos. <a href="902.htm">902</a>, <a href="914.htm">914</a> above. Precious stones in general symbolize all the truths in the doctrine of the New Jerusalem from the Word with the spiritual sense shining through, as may be seen in nos. <a href="231.htm">231</a>, <a href="540.htm">540</a>, <a href="726.htm">726</a>, <a href="911.htm">911</a>, <a href="914.htm">914</a> above. Each of the stones here symbolizes some particular truth with the spiritual meaning thus shining through. That the Word's literal sense in respect to its doctrines corresponds to precious stones of every kind may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="../ss/43.htm">43-45</a>.</p><p>[2] Two colors in general that shine through in precious stones are the color red and the color white. The rest of the colors, such as green, yellow, blue, and many others, are composites of these, modified by shades of gray. The color red symbolizes the goodness of love, and the color white symbolizes the truth of wisdom. The color red symbolizes the goodness of love because it takes its origin from the fire of the sun, and the fire of the sun in the spiritual world is, in its essence, the Lord's Divine love, thus the goodness of love. And the color white symbolizes the truth of wisdom because it takes its origin from the light that emanates from the fire of that sun, and that emanating light is, in its essence, Divine wisdom, thus the truth of wisdom. Shades of gray take their origin from that fire and light shaded, which is ignorance.</p><p>[3] However, to explain in detail just what good and just what truth is symbolized by each stone would be too lengthy a task. Nevertheless, to learn what good and truth each stone symbolizes in this list, see the exposition of chapter <a href="3927/revelation_7_1.htm">7</a> above, <a href="3927/revelation_7_5.htm">Revelation 7:5-8</a>, nos. <a href="349.htm">349-361</a>, where the subject was the twelve tribes of Israel. For each stone here has the same symbolism as each tribe named there, since the twelve tribes described there likewise symbolize all the goods and truths of the church and its doctrine in their order. Consequently we are also told in this chapter, verse <a href="3927/revelation_21_14.htm">14</a>, that on these twelve foundations were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, and the twelve apostles symbolize all of the doctrines regarding the Lord and living in accordance with His commandments (no. <a href="903.htm">903</a>).<p>The twelve stones here also have the same symbolism as the twelve precious stones in the breastpiece of Aaron, called the Urim and Thummim, as described in <a href="3927/exodus_28_15.htm">Exodus 28:15-21</a>, which we explained one by one in Arcana Coelestia (The Secrets of Heaven), <a href="../ac/9856.htm">9856-9882</a> with the difference that the stones there had on them the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, while these have on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p><p>[4] That the foundations were laid with precious stones is something we are also told in Isaiah:<p>O you afflicted one..., behold, I will lay your stones with antimony. I will set your foundations in sapphires..., and your gates in carbuncle stones... All your children have been taught by Jehovah... (<a href="3927/isaiah_54_11.htm">Isaiah 54:11-13</a>)<p>The afflicted one means a church to be established by the Lord among gentiles.<p>In Isaiah as well:<p>...thus said the Lord Jehovih: ."..I will lay in Zion a foundation stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation... I will make judgment the rule, and justice the plumb line...." (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_16.htm">Isaiah 28:16-17</a>)</p><p>[5] Since every doctrinal truth from the Word is founded on an acknowledgment of the Lord, therefore the Lord is called the Stone of Israel in <a href="3927/genesis_49_24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>, and the cornerstone which the builders rejected in <a href="3927/matthew_21_42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>, <a href="3927/mark_12_10.htm">Mark 12:10-11</a>. That the cornerstone is a foundation stone is clear from <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_26.htm">Jeremiah 51:26</a>.<p>In many places in the Word the Lord is also called a rock. Thus He meant Himself by the rock when He said, "On this rock I will build My church" (<a href="3927/matthew_16_18.htm">Matthew 16:18-19</a>). The rock symbolizes the Lord in respect to the Divine truth in the Word.<p>Everything connected with the church and its doctrine relates to these two points, that one must turn directly to the Lord, and that one must live in accordance with the Ten Commandments by refraining from evils as sins. Thus everything connected with the doctrine relates to love toward God and love for the neighbor, something that will be seen in The Doctrines of the New Jerusalem Regarding Charity, where these precepts will be expounded in turn. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 915</h4><p>915. 'The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, [<a href="20.htm">20</a>] the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst' signifies all the things of that doctrine derived from the sense of the letter of the Word in their order with those who approach the Lord directly and live in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue by fleeing from evils as sins; for these and no others are in the doctrine of love directed to God and of love towards the neighbour, which are the two foundations of religion. That by 'the twelve foundations of the wall' are signified all the things of the doctrine of the New Jerusalem derived from the sense of the letter of the Word, may be seen above (<a href="902.htm">902</a>, <a href="914.htm">914</a>); that by 'precious stones' in general are signified all the truths of the doctrine derived from the Word transparent by means of the spiritual sense, above (<a href="231.htm">231</a>, <a href="540.htm">540</a>, <a href="726.htm">726</a>, <a href="911.htm">911</a>, <a href="914.htm">914</a>). Here by each stone is signified some specific truth transparent in that manner. That the Word in the sense of the letter as to the doctrinal things thereof corresponds to precious stones of every kind, may be seen in <a href="../ss/43.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 43-45</a>.</p><p>[2] There are two colours in general that shine forth in precious stones, the colour red and the colour bright white. The rest of the colours, as green, yellow, sky-blue and many more, are composed of those modified with black (ex illis mediante nigro); and by the red colour is signified the good of love, and by the bright white colour is signified the truth of wisdom. The reason why the red colour signifies the good of love is because it derives its origin from the fire of the sun, and the fire of the sun of the spiritual world is in its essence the Lord's Divine Love, thus the good of love; and the reason why the bright white colour signifies the truth of wisdom is because it derives its origin from the light that proceeds out of the fire of that sun, and that proceeding light is in its essence Divine wisdom, thus the truth of wisdom; and black derives its origin from the shade of those, which is ignorance.</p><p>[3] But to explain in detail what [kind] of good and what [kind] of truth is signified by each stone would be too tedious. Nevertheless in order to know what of good and truth any one stone in this order signifies, the things may be seen that have been expounded above (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_7_5.htm">7:5-8</a>, <a href="349.htm">349-361</a>), where the twelve tribes of Israel are treated of. For a similar thing is signified by each stone here as by each tribe there named, since by the twelve tribes there described are likewise signified all the goods and truths of the Church and of its doctrine in their order. And therefore also it is said in this chapter (verse 14) that 'in the twelve foundations were written the names of the Lamb's twelve apostles,' and by the twelve apostles' are signified all the things of the doctrine concerning the Lord, and concerning a life in accordance with His precepts (<a href="903.htm">903</a>). Similar things also are signified by these twelve stones as by the twelve precious stones in Aaron's breastplate, which was called the Urim and Thummim (treated of in <a href="3927/exodus_28_15.htm">Exodus 28:15-21</a>, of which the details have been expounded in ARCANA CAELESTIA from <a href="../ac/9856.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9856-9882</a>), with the difference that in the latter were the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, but in the former the names of the Lamb's twelve apostles.</p><p>[4] That the foundations are of precious stones is also said in Isaiah:<p>O thou afflicted, behold I will set thy stones with stibium <sup>1</sup>, and lay thy foundations in sapphires, and thy gates in carbuncle stones; all thy sons have been taught by Jehovah. <a href="3927/isaiah_54_11.htm">Isaiah 54:11-13</a>.<p>By 'the afflicted' is understood the Church set up by the Lord with the Gentiles. In the same:<p>Thus has the Lord Jehovih said, I lay for a foundation in Zion a stone, a stone of trial, founded as a precious corner-stone; I will make thy judgment straight (in regulam), and thy justice upright (in perpendiculum). <a href="3927/isaiah_28_16.htm">Isaiah 28:16-17</a>.</p><p>[5] Since every truth of doctrine derived from the Word is founded upon the acknowledgment of the Lord, therefore the Lord is called 'the stone of Israel' (<a href="3927/genesis_49_24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>); also 'the corner-stone which the builders rejected' (<a href="3927/matthew_21_42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>; <a href="3927/mark_12_10.htm">Mark 12:10-11</a>; <a href="3927/luke_20_17.htm">Luke 20:17-18</a>). That a corner-stone is a stone of foundations is established from. <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_26.htm">Jeremiah 51:26</a>. The Lord also in the Word in many places is called a 'Rock,' and therefore by 'the Rock' He meant Himself when He said:<p>Upon this Rock will I build My Church. <a href="3927/matthew_16_18.htm">Matthew 16:18-19</a>; and also when He said:<p>He who hears My words and does them is compared to a prudent man who builds a house and lays the foundation upon a rock. <a href="3927/luke_6_47.htm">Luke 6:47-48</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_7_24.htm">Matthew 7:24-25</a>.<p>By 'a rock' is signified the Lord as to the Divine Truth of the Word. That all the things of the Church and its doctrine relate to these two things, that the Lord is to be approached directly, and that one should live in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue by fleeing from evils as sins; and that all the things of the doctrine relate to love directed to God and to love towards the neighbour, will be seen in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING CHARITY, where these things will be set forth in their order.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;A word meaning antimony used as a cosmetic or pigment. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 915</h4><p>915. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald (verse <a href="3927/revelation_21_20.htm">20</a>), the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprasus, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst, signifies all things of that doctrine in their order, from the sense of the letter of the Word, with those who immediately approach the Lord, and live according to the commandments of the Decalogue by shunning evils as sins; for these and no others are in the doctrine of love to God, and of love towards the neighbor, which two loves are the fundamentals of religion. That by "the twelve foundations of the wall" are signified all things of the doctrine of the New Jerusalem from the sense of the letter of the Word, may be seen above, (<a href="902.htm">902</a>, <a href="914.htm">914</a>). That by "precious stones" in general are signified all the truths of doctrine from the Word translucent through the spiritual sense (above <a href="231.htm">231</a>, <a href="540.htm">540</a>, <a href="726.htm">726</a>, <a href="911.htm">911</a>, <a href="914.htm">914</a>); here by each stone is signified some truth in particular thus translucent. That the Word in the sense of the letter as to its doctrinal corresponds to precious stones of every kind, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, (<a href="43.htm">43-45</a>).</p><p>[2] There are two colors in general, which shine forth in precious stones, the color red and the color bright white; the other colors, as green, yellow, blue, and many others, are composed of them, by means of black; and by the color red is signified the good of love, and by the color bright white is signified the truth of wisdom. The reason why red signifies the good of love is because it derives its origin from the fire of the sun, and the fire of the sun of the spiritual world is in its essence the Divine love of the Lord, this the good of love; and the reason why the color bright white signifies the truth of wisdom, is because it derives its origin from the light which proceeds from the fire of that sun, and that proceeding light is in its essence the Divine wisdom, thus the truth of wisdom.</p><p>[3] And black derives its origin from their shade, which is ignorance. But to explain what particular of good or of truth is signified by each stone, would be too prolix; but yet that it may be known what particular good and truth each stone in this order signifies, see what is explained above (<a href="3927/revelation_7_5.htm">Revelation 7:5-8</a>; no. <a href="349.htm">349-361</a>), where the twelve tribes of Israel are treated of; for the like is here signified by each stone, as by each tribe there named, because by the twelve tribes there described are signified in like manner all the goods and truths of the church and of its doctrine in their order; therefore it is also said in this chapter (verse <a href="3927/revelation_21_14.htm">14</a>), that in these twelve foundations were written the "names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb," and by "the twelve apostles" are signified all things of doctrine concerning the Lord, and concerning a life according to His commandments, (<a href="903.htm">903</a>).<p>The same is also signified by these twelve stones, as by the twelve precious stones in the breastplate of Aaron, which was called Urim and Thummim (see <a href="3927/exodus_28_15.htm">Exodus 28:15-21</a> the explanation of which is given in The <a href="../ac/9856.htm">Arcana Coelestia 9856-9882</a>, with this difference, that upon the latter were the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, but upon the former the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb).</p><p>[4] That the foundations are of precious stones is also said in Isaiah:<p>Oh, thou afflicted, behold, I will lay thy stones with stibium, and lay thy foundations with sapphires, and thy gates of stones of carbuncles; all thy sons shall be taught of Jehovah, (<a href="3927/isaiah_54_11.htm">54:11-12</a>(, <a href="3927/isaiah_54_13.htm">13</a>)<p>By "the afflicted" is meant the church to be established by the Lord with the Gentiles. In the same:<p>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation; judgment also I will make a rule, and justice a plummet, (<a href="3927/isaiah_23_16.htm">23:16-17</a>).</p><p>[5] Since all the truth of doctrine from the Word must be founded upon the acknowledgment of the Lord, therefore the Lord is called:<p>The stone of Israel, (<a href="3927/genesis_49_24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>).<p>Also the cornerstone which the builders rejected, (<a href="3927/matthew_21_42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>; <a href="3927/mark_12_10.htm">Mark 12:10-11</a>; <a href="3927/luke_20_17.htm">Luke 20:17-18</a>).<p>That the cornerstone is the foundation stone, appears from <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_26.htm">Jeremiah 51:26</a>. The Lord also in the Word in many places is called a "Rock," wherefore by the "Rock" He meant Himself, when He said:<p>Upon this rock I will build My church, (<a href="3927/matthew_16_18.htm">Matthew 16:18-19</a>);<p>And also when He said:<p>Whosoever heareth My words and doeth them, is compared to a prudent man who buildeth a house and layeth the foundation upon a rock, (<a href="3927/luke_6_47.htm">Luke 6:47-48</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_7_24.htm">Matthew 7:24-25</a>(, <a href="3927/matthew_7_26.htm">26</a>).<p>By "a rock" is signified the Lord as to the Divine truth of the Word. That all things of the church and of its doctrine relate to these two: that the Lord is to be approached immediately and that man must live a life according to the commandments of the Decalogue by shunning evils as sins; and that thus all things of doctrine relate to love to God, and to love towards the neighbor, will be seen in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning Charity, where these things will be set forth in their order. </p>

"Fundamentum primum jaspis, secundum, sapphirus, tertium chalcedonius, quantum smaragdus," (Vers. 20) "quintum sardonyx, sextum sardius, septimum chrysolithus, octavum beryllus, nonum topazius, decimum chrysoprasus, undecimum hyacinthus, duodecimum amethystus," significat omnia doctrinae illius ex Verbi Sensu literae in suo ordine apud illos qui immediate adeunt Dominum, et vivunt secundum praecepta Decalogi fugiendo mala ut peccata, hi enim et non alii in doctrina amoris in Deum, et amoris erga proximum sunt, quae duo sunt fundamenta religionis. - Quod per "duodecim fundamenta muri" significentur omnia doctrinae novae Hierosolymae ex Sensu literae Verbi, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_902" target=_top>902</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_914" target=_top>914</a>); quod per "lapides pretiosos" in genere significentur omnia vera doctrinae ex Verbo translucentia per Sensum spiritualem (supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_231" target=_top>231</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_540" target=_top>540</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_726" target=_top>726</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_911" target=_top>911</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_914" target=_top>914</a>); <sup>1</sup>hic per quemlibet lapidem significatur aliquod verum in specie ita translucens. Quod Verbum in Sensu literae quoad doctrinalia ejus correspondeat lapidibus pretiosis omnis generis, videatur in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_43" target=_top>43-45</a>) <sup>2</sup>, Sunt duo colores in genere, qui in lapidibus pretiosis pellucent, color ruber et color candidus; reliqui colores, ut viridis, flavus, caeruleus, et plures alii, sunt compositi ex illis, mediante nigro; et per colorem rubrum significatur bonum amoris, et per colorem candidum significatur verum sapientiae. Quod color ruber significet bonum amoris, est quia trahit originem ex igne solis, et ignis Solis mundi spiritualis est in sua essentia Divinus Amor Domini, ita bonum amoris; et quod color candidus significet verum sapientiae, est quia trahit originem ex luce quae procedit ex igne illius Solis, et lux illa procedens est in sua essentia Divina Sapientia, ita verum sapientiae: et nigrum trahit originem ex umbra illorum, quae est ignorantia. Sed singulariter explicare quid boni et quid veri significatur per quemlibet lapidem, nimis prolixum foret; at usque ut sciatur quid boni et veri unusquisque lapis in hoc ordine significat, videantur quae supra, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_7_5-8" target=_top>7:5-8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_349" target=_top>349-361</a>) explicata sunt, ubi de duodecim Tribubus Israelis agitur; simile enim hic significatur per quemlibet lapidem quod per quamlibet Tribum ibi nominatam, quoniam per duodecim Tribus ibi descriptas similiter significantur omnia bona et vera Ecclesiae et doctrinae ejus in suo ordine; quare etiam dicitur in hoc capite (vers. 14) quod in fundamentis his duodecim scripta essent nomina duodecim Apostolorum Agni, et per "duodecim Apostolos" significantur omnia doctrinae de Domino, et de Vita secundum praecepta Ipsius (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_903" target=_top>903</a>). Similia etiam significantur per duodecim hos lapides, quae per duodecim lapides pretiosos in pectorali Aharonis, quod Urim et Thummim vocabatur (de quibus, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_28_15-21" target=_top>Exodus 28:15-21</a>, quae in Arcanis Caelestibus, a <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_9856" target=_top>9856-9882</a>, singillatim explicata sunt), cum differentia quod in his essent nomina duodecim Tribuum Israelis, in illis autem nomina duodecim Apostolorum Agni. Quod fundamenta sint ex lapidibus pretiosis, etiam dicitur apud Esajam: <p>"O afflicta, ecce Ego disponam cum stibio Lapides tuos, Fundamenta tua ponam in Sapphiris, et portas tuas in Lapides Carbunculi; omnes filii tui docti a Jehovah," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_54_11-12" target=_top>54:11-12</a> (, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_54_13" target=_top>13</a>) <p>per "afflictam" intelligitur Ecclesia a Domino apud gentes instauranda. Apud eundem: <p>"Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Ego fundabo in Zione Lapidem, Lapidem probationis, angulum pretii fundationis fundatae; ponam judicium in regulam, et justitiam in perpendiculum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_28_16-17" target=_top>28:16-17</a>).<p>Quoniam omne verum doctrinae ex Verbo fundabitur super agnitione Domini, ideo Dominus vocatur "Lapis Israelis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_49_24" target=_top>Genesis 49:24</a>);<p>Tum "Lapis Anguli quem reprobaverunt architecti," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_21_42" target=_top>Matthaeus 21:42</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_12_10-11" target=_top>Marcus 12:10-11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_20_17-18" target=_top>Luca 20:17-18</a>);<p>quod "lapis Anguli" sit lapis fundamentorum, constat ex <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_51_26" target=_top>Jeremias 51:26</a>. Dominus etiam in Verbo multis in locis vocatur "Petra;" quare Ipse Se intelligit per "Petram," cum dixit, <p>"Super hac Petra aedificabo Ecclesiam Meam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_16_18-19" target=_top>Matthaeus 16:18-19</a>);<p>et quoque cum dixit, <p>"Qui audit verba Mea et facit ea, comparatur viro prudenti, qui aedificat domum et ponit fundamentum super Petra," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_6_47-48" target=_top>Luca 6:47-48</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_7_24-25" target=_top>Matthaeus 7:24-25</a>);<p>per "Petram" significatur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum Verbi. Quod omnia Ecclesiae et Doctrinae ejus se referant ad haec duo, quod immediate adeundus sit Dominus, et quod vivendum sit secundum praecepta Decalogi fugiendo mala ut peccata, et quod sic omnia doctrinae se referant ad amorem in Deum et ad amorem erga proximum, videbitur in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Charitate, ubi haec in suo ordine exponentur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;911 pro "811" et 914 pro "814"<p>2.&nbsp;43-45 pro "43, 44, 45, 46" </p>
