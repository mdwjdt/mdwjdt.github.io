<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>354.“拿弗他利支派中受印的有一万二千”表示那些将要在主的新天堂和新教会之人所具有的对功用和何为功用的领悟。在至高意义上，“拿弗他利”表示主的神性人的固有能力；在属灵意义上，表示试探并得胜；在属世意义上，表示属世人的抵制；因为他因相争而得名。但此处“拿弗他利”表示对功用，以及何为功用的领悟，因为在次序上他在亚设之后，而亚设表示对功用之爱；还因为凡在试探中得胜的人都有对功用的内在领悟；事实上，心智的内层通过试探被打开。他们所拥有的领悟在耶利米书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.33.htm">31:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.34.htm">34</a>）有所描述；他们内心能感觉到何为良善，也能明白何为真理。“拿弗他利支派”表示天使和世人的这种领悟，这一点可从圣言中的这些事得以证实：</p><p>拿弗他利人在田野的高处。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.18.htm">5:18</a>）</p><p>“田野”的高处是指在领悟方面的教会内在。</p><p>拿弗他利啊，你足沾恩惠，满得耶和华的福，可以得西方和南方为业。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.23.htm">33:23</a>）</p><p>“得西方”是指热爱服侍的良善，“得南方”是指智慧之光，也就是这种领悟。拿弗他利是只释放的母鹿，发出嘉美的言语。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.21.htm">49:21</a>）</p><p>此处描述了试探后的状态，即出于领悟的自由雄辩。</p><p>经上还记着说：</p><p>拿弗他利支派的一个人满有智慧、聪明、技能，在所罗门的殿中作各样的铜工。（列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上7.14.htm">7:14</a>）</p><p>就名字和支派而言，圣言的历史书部分和预言部分的含义是一样的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 354</h4><p>354. Of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand were sealed. This symbolizes a perception of useful endeavor, and of what is useful, in those people who will be in the New Heaven and in the Lord's New Church.<p>In the highest sense Naphtali symbolizes the intrinsic power of the Lord's Divine humanity; in the spiritual sense, temptation or trial, and victory; and in the natural sense, resistance on the part of the natural self. For his name was derived from a word meaning wrestling. Here, however, Naphtali symbolizes a perception of useful endeavor, and of what is useful, because in the series he comes after Asher, who symbolizes a love of useful services. Moreover those people who have overcome in temptations or trials have an interior perception of useful ends; for temptations or trials open the interior constituents of the mind.<p>The perception that those people have is described in <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>. <sup>1</sup>They sense in themselves what is good, and see in themselves what is true.<p>That the tribe of Naphtali symbolizes angels and people in respect to that perception can be confirmed from the following verses in the Word:<p>...Naphtali... on the heights of the field. (<a href="3927/judges_5_18.htm">Judges 5:18</a>)<p>The heights of the field are the interior qualities of the Church as regards perception.<p>O Naphtali, abounding in favor, and full of the blessing of Jehovah, possess the west and the south. (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a>)<p>To possess the west is to possess the goodness of a love that serves, and the south is the light of wisdom which constitutes the aforesaid perception.<p>Naphtali is a deer let loose, who provides elegant discourses. (<a href="3927/genesis_49_21.htm">Genesis 49:21</a>)<p>Thus is described the state after temptation or trial as to its free expression from perception.<p>It is recorded also that a certain man of the tribe of Naphtali, "being filled with wisdom, understanding and knowledge," did all work in bronze for Solomon's temple (<a href="3927/1-kings_7_14.htm">1 Kings 7:14</a>).<p>The narrative portions of the Word as regards names and tribes are just as symbolic as the prophetic portions.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says Jehovah: I will put My law in their minds and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. No more shall every man teach his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, 'Know Jehovah,' for they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says Jehovah. For I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 354</h4><p>354. 'Out of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand sealed' signifies the perception of uses and of what uses are, with those who will be in the New Heaven and in the Lord's New Church. By 'Naphtali' in the highest sense is signified the Peculiar (Proprius) Power of the Lord's Divine Human; in the spiritual sense temptation and victory, and in the natural sense resistance by the natural man; for he was named from 'wrestlings.' Here, however, by 'Naphtali' is signified the perception of uses and of what uses are, because in the series it follows after Asher, by whom is signified the love of uses and also because they who have conquered in temptations have an interior perception of uses, for the interiors of the mind are opened by means of temptations. The perception which these have is described in <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>; they feel in themselves what is good, and see in themselves what is true. That 'the tribe of Naphtali' signifies angels and men as to that perception can be confirmed from these [statements] in the Word:<p>Naphtali upon the high places of the field, <a href="3927/judges_5_18.htm">Judges 5:18</a>.<p>The 'high places of the field' are the interior things of the Church as to perception.<p>Naphtali is satisfied with good pleasure, and full with the blessing of Jehovah; possess thou the west and the south. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a>.<p>To 'possess the west' is the good of the love of being serviceable, while the 'south' is the light of wisdom which is that perception.<p>Naphtali is a hind let loose giving discourses of elegance. <a href="3927/genesis_49_21.htm">Genesis 49:21</a>.<p>Thus the state after temptation is described as to free eloquence out of perception. It is also recorded that one of the tribe of Naphtali filled with wisdom, intelligence and knowledge, wrought all Solomon's work on the temple out of bronze, <a href="3927/1-kings_7_14.htm">1 Kings 7:14</a>.<p>The historical parts of the Word, as to names and tribes, are significant just as much as the prophetical. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 354</h4><p>354. Of the tribe of Naphtali were sealed twelve thousand, signifies the perception of use and what use is, with those who will be in the Lord's New Heaven and New Church. By "Naphtali" in the highest sense, is signified the proper power of the Lord's Divine Human; in the spiritual sense, temptation and victory; and, in the natural sense, resistance by the natural man; for he was named from wrestlings.

It is also recorded that:<p>One of the tribe of Naphtali was filled with wisdom, intelligence and knowledge and made all Solomon's work about the temple in brass, (<a href="3927/1-kings_7_14.htm">1 Kings 7:14</a>).<p>The historical parts of the Word, as to names and tribes, are equally as significative as the prophetical. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 354 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>354. "Ex tribu Naphtali duodecim millia signati" significat Perceptionem usus et quid usus, apud illos qui in Novo Caelo et illi Nova Ecclesia Domini erunt. - Per "Naphtali" in supremo Sensu significatur Propria Potentia Divini Humani Domini, in Sensu spirituali Tentatio et Victoria, et in Sensu naturali Reluctatio a naturali homine; nominatus enim est a Luctationibus: quod autem hic per "Naphtalim" significetur Perceptio usus et quid usus, est quia in serie sequitur post Ascherem, per quem significatur Amor usuum; et quoque interior perceptio usuum est illis qui in tentationibus vicerunt; per tentationes enim aperiuntur interiora mentis. Perceptio, quae illis est, describitur apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_354/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_31_33-34" target=_top>Jeremiam 31:33-34</a>; sentiunt in se quid bonum, et vident in se quid verum. Quod "Tribus Naphtali" significet angelos et homines quoad illam perceptionem, potest ex his in Verbo confirmari: <p>"Naphtali super altitudinibus agri," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_354/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_judges_5_18" target=_top>Judicum 5:18</a>);<p>"altitudines agri" sunt interiora Ecclesiae quoad perceptionem. <p>Naphtali satur beneplacito, et plenus benedictione Jehovae, occidentem et meridiem posside," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_354/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_33_23" target=_top>Deuteronomius 33:23</a>);<p>"occidentem possidere" est bonum amoris inservientis; ac "meridiem," est lucem sapientiae, quae est perceptio illa. <p>"Naphtali cerva emissa, dans sermones elegantiae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_354/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_49_21" target=_top>Genesis 49:21</a>);<p>describitur sic status post tentationem quoad liberum eloquium ex perceptione. Memoratur etiam quod Unus ex Tribu Naphtali, repletus sapientia, intelligentia et scientia, fecerit omne opus Salomonis ad Templum ex aere, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_354/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_1-kings_7_14" target=_top>1 Regnum 7:14</a>).<p>Historica Verbi quoad nomina et quoad tribus, aeque significant sicut Prophetica. </p>
