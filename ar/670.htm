<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第670节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>670.启15:6.“那掌管七灾的七位天使，从殿中出来”表主为天堂的至内层进入教会的流注所作的预备，即教会的邪恶与虚假要被普遍揭露，因而恶人要与善人分离。“七位天使”表示主（参看<a href="657.htm">657</a>节）；“七灾”表示普遍所理解的一切邪恶与虚假（也参看<a href="657.htm">657</a>节）。“殿”表示天堂的至内层，就是圣言和十诫所在之处，如前所述（<a href="669.htm">669</a>节）。他们“从殿中出来”表示为流注所作的预备，因为“他们出来”，是为了后来他们可以接碗，并将碗里的七灾倒在地上、海里、江河、泉源、日头里，以及兽的座位上和空中；以此表示进入教会的流注，好叫教会的邪恶与虚假被揭露出来。做这一切是为了把他们与善人分离，这一点可见于下一章。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 670</h4><p>670. <a href="3927/revelation_15_6.htm">15:6</a> And out of the temple came the seven angels having the seven plagues. This symbolizes a preparation by the Lord for influx from the inmost of heaven into the church, to expose its evils and falsities in their entirety and so to separate evil people from the good.<p>That the seven angels mean the Lord may be seen in no. <a href="657.htm">657</a> above. That the seven plagues symbolize all evils and falsities viewed in their entirety may also be seen in no. <a href="657.htm">657</a> above. The temple here means the inmost of heaven where the Word and Ten Commandments reside, as may be seen just above in no. <a href="669.htm">669</a>. The angels' coming out of the temple symbolizes a preparation for influx because they came out to receive bowls and then pour out the plagues in the bowls onto the earth, onto the sea, onto the rivers and springs, onto the sun, upon the throne of the beast, and into the air, and these events symbolize an influx into the church in order to expose its evils and falsities. We will see in the next chapter that this was done to separate the evil from the good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 670</h4><p>670. [verse 6] 'And the seven angels having the seven plagues went out of the temple' signifies the preparation by the Lord for an influx out of the inmost of heaven into the Church, so that its evils and untruths might be completely disclosed, and thus the evil be separated from the good. That by 'the seven angels' is understood the Lord may be seen above (<a href="657.htm">657</a>); that by 'the seven plagues' are signified all evils and untruths completely understood, also above (<a href="657.htm">657</a>). By 'the temple' here is understood the inmost of heaven, where the Word is and the Decalogue, as just above (<a href="669.htm">669</a>). By 'went out of the temple' is signified preparation for influx, because they went out so that after they took the phials they might cast the plagues in the phials into the land, into the sea, into rivers and fountains, into the sun, upon the throne of the beast, and into the air, by which is signified an influx into the Church so that its evils and untruths might be discovered. That this is for the sake of their separation from the good will be seen in the following chapter. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 670</h4><p>670. Verse 6. And the seven angels that had the seven plagues came out of the temple, signifies the preparation by the Lord for influx from the inmost of heaven into the church, that its evils and falsities may be universally disclosed, and thus the evil be separated from the good. That by "the seven angels" the Lord is meant, see above, (<a href="657.htm">657</a>); that by "the seven plagues" are signified all evils and falsities understood universally, see also above, (<a href="657.htm">657</a>). By "the temple" is meant the inmost of heaven, where the Word and the Decalogue are, as above, (<a href="669.htm">669</a>). That by "their going out from the temple" is signified preparation for influx is because they went out that afterward they might receive the vials, and cast the plagues in the vials into the earth, the sea, the rivers, and fountains, the sun, upon the throne of the beast, and into the air; by which is signified influx into the church, that its evils and falsities might be disclosed. That this was done for the sake of separating them from the good, will be seen in the next chapter. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 670 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>670. (Vers. 6.) "Et exiverunt septem Angeli habentes septem plagas e Templo" significat praeparationem a Domino ad influxum ex intimo Caeli in Ecclesiam, ut mala et falsa ejus universaliter detegerentur, et sic separarentur mali a bonis. -Quod per "septem Angelos" intelligatur Dominus, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_670/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_657" target=_top>657</a>); quod per "septem plagas" significentur omnia mala et falsa universaliter intellecta, etiam supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_670/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_657" target=_top>657</a>); per "Templum" hic intelligitur intimum Caeli, ubi Verbum et Decalogus, ut mox supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_670/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_669" target=_top>669</a>); quod per "exiverint e Templo" significetur praeparatio ad influxum, est quia exiverunt ut postquam acceperint phialas projicerent plagas in phialis in terram, in mare, in fluvios et fontes, in Solem, super thronum Bestiae, et in aerem, per quae significatur influxus in Ecclesiam ut mala et falsa ejus detegantur; quod hoc propter separationem illorum a bonis, videbitur in capite sequente. </p>
