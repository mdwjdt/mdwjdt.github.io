<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>9.“因为时候近了”表教会的状态是这样，它无法再继续与主结合。与主结合并由此实现救恩的要素有二，一为承认一位神，二为悔改的生活。然时至今日，承认三位神取代了承认一位神，仅口头忏悔自己是罪人取代了悔改的生活，通过这二者的结合不复存在。因此，除非承认并奉行这两大要素的新教会兴起，否则没有人能得救。因为有此危险，主减少了那时日，正如祂在马太福音所说的话：</p><p>因为那时必有大灾难，从世界的起头直到如今，没有这样的灾难，将来也必没有。若不减少那日子，凡有血气的，总没有一个得救的。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.21.htm">24:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.22.htm">22</a>）</p><p>所指的不是时间近了，这一点可参看下文（<a href="947.htm">947</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 9</h4><p>9. For the time is near. This symbolically means, the state of the church being such that it can no longer continue to maintain its conjunction with the Lord.<p>There are two essential elements which make possible a conjunction with the Lord and so salvation: an acknowledgment of one God, and repentance of life. But at the present day instead of an acknowledgment of one God we have an acknowledgment of three, and instead of repentance of life, a repentance solely of the lips that one is a sinner; and these two do not lead to any conjunction. Consequently, unless a new church arises which acknowledges the two essential elements and lives them, no one can be saved. Because of this danger, the Lord has shortened the time, in accordance with His words in Matthew:<p>...then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, nor shall be. Indeed, unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved. (<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21-22</a>)<p>This does not mean near at hand or a nearness in time, as may be seen in no. <a href="947.htm">947</a> below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 9</h4><p>9. 'For the time is near' signifies that the state of the Church is such that it cannot any longer endure so as to have conjunction with the Lord. There are two Essentials through which there is conjunction with the Lord and thereby salvation, ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE ONE GOD, and REPENTANCE OF LIFE. Today, however, instead of an acknowledgment of the One God, there is an acknowledgment of three [Gods], and instead of a repentance of life there is repentance of the mouth only, [saying] that one is a sinner; and there is no conjunction through these two. Therefore unless a new Church rises up, which acknowledges those two Essentials, and lives them, no one can be saved. On account of this danger the time has been shortened by the Lord, in accordance with His words in Matthew:<p>Then shall be great affliction, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, nor shall be; yea, except those days should he shortened, no flesh would be preserved. <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21-22</a>.<p>That near or nearness of time is not understood may be seen below (<a href="947.htm">947</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 9</h4><p>9. For the time is near, signifies that the state of the church is such, that it cannot endure any longer as to its conjunction with the Lord. There are two essentials by which conjunction with the Lord, and thence salvation is effected, the acknowledgment of one God, and repentance of life; but at this day, instead of the acknowledgment of one God, there is an acknowledgment of three, and instead of repentance of life, there is repentance of the mouth only that one is a sinner; and by these two there is not any conjunction; therefore unless the New Church should arise, which acknowledges these two essentials, and lives accordingly, no one can be saved; on account of this danger the time is shortened by the Lord, according to His words in Matthew:<p>For then shall be great affliction, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, nor shall be; yea, except those days should be shortened, no flesh should be saved, (<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21-22</a>).<p>That near or nearness of time is not meant, may be seen below, (<a href="947.htm">947</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 9 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>9. "Quia tempus prope," significat quod status Ecclesiae talis sit, ut diutius non possit persistere, ut ejus conjunctio sit cum Domino. - Sunt duo Essentialia, per quae fit conjunctio cum Domino et inde salvatio, Agnitio unius Dei, et Paenitentia vitae; sed hodie pro agnitione unius Dei est agnitio Trium, et pro Paenitentia vitae est paenitentia solius oris quod peccator Sit, et per haec duo non est aliqua conjunctio; quare nisi nova Ecclesia, quae agnoscit duo illa Essentialia, et vivit illa, exsurgat, non potest aliquis salvari propter hoc periculum abbreviatum est tempus a Domino, secundum Ipsius verba apud Matthaeum, <p>"Erit tunc afflictio magna, qualis non fuit ab initio mundi usque nunc, nec erit; imo nisi abbreviarentur dies illi, non conservaretur ulla caro," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_9/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_21-22" target=_top>24:21-22</a>).<p>Quod non intelligatur prope seu propinquum temporis, videatur infra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_9/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_947" target=_top>947</a>). </p>
