<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第781节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>781.“马，车，并人的身体和灵魂”表所有这些事物都取决于他们所没有的对圣言的理解，由此而来的教义，以及圣言字义的良善与真理，因为他们利用圣言中的事物来统治天堂和世界，违背圣言的真正意义，因而歪曲并玷污了圣言。提及这些事物时用的是所有格，因为它们用来修饰之前的事物。“马”表示对圣言的理解（参看<a href="298.htm">298</a>节）。“车”表示出于圣言的教义（<a href="437.htm">437</a>节）；因此，“马车”所表相同。“人的身体和灵魂”表示圣言字义的良善与真理，这是因为它们与圣餐中的“身体和血”表示相同事物。圣餐中的“身体”表示主的神性良善，圣餐中的“血”表示主的神性真理；它们因表示这些，故也表示圣言的神性良善和神性真理，因为主就是圣言。不过，此处经上说的是“灵魂”，以取代“血”。原因在于，灵魂同样表示真理（参看<a href="681.htm">681</a>节）；还因为在圣言中，“血”被称为“灵魂”（soul，经上常译为性命）（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创9.4.htm">9:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创9.5.htm">5</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利17.12.htm">17:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利17.14.htm">14</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.23.htm">12:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.25.htm">25</a>）。“人的灵魂”（经上或译人的性命，或人口）（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.13.htm">27:13</a>），以及“人的种”（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.43.htm">2:43</a>）所表相同。</p><p>在以赛亚书，“马”和“车”表示相同事物：</p><p>他们必将你们的弟兄或骑马，或坐车，坐马车，骑骡子，骑独峰驼，到我的圣山耶路撒冷。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.20.htm">66:20</a>）</p><p>这论及主的新教会，也就是耶路撒冷，涉及其中那些处于“马”、“车”和“马车”所表示的对圣言的理解和由此而来的教义之人。由于那些属天主教的人歪曲并玷污圣言，用来统治天堂和世界，故所表示的是他们没有出于圣言的良善与真理，因而他们的教义中也没有良善与真理。对此，耶利米书上说：</p><p>巴比伦王吞灭我，压碎我，使我成为空虚的器皿，他像鲸鱼将我吞下，用我的美物充满他的肚腹。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.34.htm">51:34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.35.htm">35</a>）</p><p>有剑临到巴比伦的马匹，她的车辆，临到她的宝物，它们就被抢夺；有干旱临到她的众水，它们就必干涸；因为这是有雕刻偶像之地，他们夸耀可怕之物。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 50.37.htm"> 50:37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 50.38.htm">38</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 781</h4><p>781. "And merchandise of horses, and wagons, and the bodies and souls of people." This symbolically means that all of these things depend on an understanding of the Word and on doctrine drawn from it, and on the goods and truths in the Word's literal sense, which these Roman Catholics do not possess, because they have falsified and adulterated the Word by using the things in it contrary to their real meaning in order to gain dominion over heaven and the world.<p>The valuables here follow the preposition "of," because they involve all of the things that go before. That horses symbolize an understanding of the Word may be seen in no. <a href="298.htm">298</a>. Chariots symbolize doctrine from the Word (no. <a href="437.htm">437</a>); consequently so do wagons. The bodies and souls of people symbolize goods and truths in the literal sense of the Word, because they have the same symbolism as the body and blood in the Holy Supper. The body in that supper symbolizes the Lord's Divine goodness, and the blood the Lord's Divine truth; and because of this symbolism they also symbolize the Divine good and truth in the Word, because the Lord embodies the Word.<p>Instead of blood, however, the text here says souls. That is because the soul likewise symbolizes truth (see no. <a href="681.htm">681</a> above), and because blood in the Word is called the life or soul (<a href="3927/genesis_9_4.htm">Genesis 9:4-5</a>). "Human lives" in <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a> has a similar symbolic meaning. So does the "seed of men" in <a href="3927/daniel_2_43.htm">Daniel 2:43</a>.</p><p>[2] Horses and wagons have a similar symbolic meaning in Isaiah:<p>Then they shall bring all your brethren... on horses and in chariots and in wagons, and on mules and on camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem... (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_20.htm">Isaiah 66:20</a>)<p>This is said of the Lord's New Church, which Jerusalem is, regarding people in it who have an understanding of the Word and doctrine derived from it, which are the horses, chariots, and wagons.<p>Now because these people of the Roman Catholic religion falsify and adulterate the Word by using it to gain dominion over heaven and the world, the symbolic meaning here is that they do not possess any goods and truths from the Word, and so do not have any in their doctrine either.<p>Regarding this Jeremiah says the following:<p>...the king of Babylon has devoured me, has thrown me into confusion; He has made me an empty vessel; He has swallowed me up like a whale; He has filled his stomach with my delicacies... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_34.htm">Jeremiah 51:34-35</a>)<p>A sword is against the horses (of Babylon), against her chariots, and... against her treasures, so that they are plundered. A drought is upon her waters, so that they are dried up. For the land is one of carved images, and they boast of their dreadful deeds. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37-38</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 781</h4><p>781. 'And of horses and of carriages and of bodies and the souls of men' signifies all those things in accordance with the understanding of the Word and the doctrine therefrom, and in accordance with the goods and truths of the sense of the letter thereof, which they do not have because they are falsifying and adulterating the Word by applying the things that are there to dominion over heaven and the world, contrary to its genuine sense. These things are said in the genitive case because they belong to the things that precede. That by 'horses' the understanding of the Word is signified may be seen (<a href="298.htm">298</a>). That by 'chariots doctrine out of the Word is signified (<a href="437.htm">437</a>); consequently the like by 'carriages.' That the goods and truths of the sense of the letter of the Word are signified by 'bodies and the souls of men' is because similar things are signified by them as by the body and blood in the Holy Supper. In that, by the 'body' is signified the Lord's Divine Good and by the 'blood' the Lord's Divine Truth; and because they signify those they also signify the Divine Good and Divine Truth of the Word, because the Lord is the Word. But here instead of 'blood' it is termed 'soul.' This is because by 'soul' in like manner Truth is signified as may be seen above (<a href="681.htm">681</a>), and because in the Word the blood is called 'the soul' (<a href="3927/genesis_9_4.htm">Genesis 9:4-5</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_17_12.htm">Leviticus 17:12-14</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_23.htm">Deuteronomy 12:23-25</a>). The like is signified by 'the soul of man (<a href="3927/ezekiel_27_13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>); also by 'the seed of man' (<a href="3927/daniel_2_43.htm">Daniel 2:43</a>).</p><p>[2] Similar things are signified by 'horses' and 'carriages' in Isaiah:<p>Then shall they bring all your brothers upon horses and upon the chariot and upon carriages, and upon mules and upon swift horses unto the mountain of My holiness, Jerusalem. <a href="3927/isaiah_66_20.htm">Isaiah 66:20</a>.<p>These things are said of the Lord's New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, concerning those there who are in the understanding of the Word and in doctrine therefrom, which are 'horses,' 'the chariot,' and 'carriages.' Now because those who are of the Roman Catholic form of religion falsify and adulterate the Word by the application [thereof] to dominion over heaven and the world, it is signified that they do not have any goods and truths out of the Word, and therefore neither do they have them in their doctrine. On this point Jeremiah says thus:<p>The king of Babel has eaten me up, he has thrown me into confusion, he has made me an empty vessel, he has swallowed me up like a whale, he has filled his belly with my luxuries. <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_34.htm">Jeremiah 51:34-35</a>.<p>The sword is against the horses of Babel, and against its chariots, and against its treasures, that they may be pillaged; a drought is upon its waters that they may be dried up; because it is a land of graven images, and they boast of their terrible things. <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37-38</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 781</h4><p>781. And of horses and carriages and the bodies and souls of men, signifies all those things according to the understanding of the Word and doctrine thence, and according to the goods and truths of the sense of its letter, which they have not, because they falsify and adulterate the Word, by applying the things which are therein to dominion over heaven and the world, contrary to its genuine sense. These things are named in the possessive case, because they qualify those which precede. That the understanding of the Word is signified by "horses," may be seen, (<a href="298.htm">298</a>). That by "chariots" doctrine from the Word is signified, (<a href="437.htm">437</a>); hence the like by "carriages." That the goods and truths of the sense of the letter of the Word are signified by "the bodies and souls of men," is because similar things are signified by them as by the body and blood in the Holy Supper. By "the body" in the Holy Supper is signified the Lord's Divine good, and by "the blood" the Lord's Divine truth; and because they signify these, they also signify the Divine good and the Divine truth of the Word, because the Lord is the Word. But here it is said "the soul" instead of "blood." The reason is, that truth is likewise signified by the soul, see above, (<a href="681.htm">681</a>); and because the blood is called "the soul" in the Word, (<a href="3927/genesis_9_4.htm">Genesis 9:4-5</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_17_12.htm">Leviticus 17:12-14</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_12_23.htm">Deuteronomy 12:23-25</a>). The like is signified by the "soul of man" (<a href="3927/ezekiel_27_13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>); also by the "seed of man" (<a href="3927/daniel_2_43.htm">Daniel 2:43</a>).</p><p>[2] Similar things are signified by "horses" and "carriages" in Isaiah:<p>Then shall they bring all your brethren upon horses and upon chariots and upon carriages, and upon mules and upon coursers, unto the mountain of My holiness, Jerusalem, (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_20.htm">Isaiah 66:20</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord's New Church, which is Jerusalem, concerning those therein who are in the understanding of the Word and in doctrine thence, which are "horses," "chariots," and "carriages." Now because they who are of the Roman Catholic religious persuasion falsify and adulterate the Word, by the application to dominion over heaven and the world, it is signified that they have no goods and truths from the Word, and therefore neither in their doctrine. Concerning this Jeremiah says:<p>The king of Babel hath devoured me, he hath disturbed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up as a whale, he hath filled his belly with my delicacies, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_34.htm">Jeremiah 51:34</a>).<p>A sword is against the horses of Babel, and against his chariots, and against his treasures, that they may be pillaged; drought is upon her waters, that they may be dried up; because it is a land of graven images, and they glory in their terrible things, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37-38</a>). </p>
