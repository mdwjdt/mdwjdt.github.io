align="center">灵义</h4><h4 align="center">整章内容</h4><p>主的神性人将通过并照着圣言施行审判，因为祂本身就是圣言。三层天的天使都承认这一点。</p><h4 align="center">各节内容</h4><p>第1节.“我看见坐宝座的右手中有书卷，里外都写着字”表主永恒的神性本身，祂全能、全知，祂是圣言（<a

href="292.htm">292</a>节）。“二十四长老也俯伏敬拜那活到世世代代的”表所有在天堂者在主面前的谦卑，和谦卑所生的对主的崇拜，永生来自祂，并在祂里面（<a href="293.htm">293</a>节）。</p><h4 align="center">诠释</h4><p>256.“我看见坐宝座的右手中有书卷，里外都写着字”表主永恒的神性本身，祂全能、全知，祂是圣言；祂凭自己知道天上、地上所有人的生命状态，无论总体和细节。“坐宝座的”表示主的神性，祂的人性出于祂的神性，因为后面说“羔羊从坐宝座的右手里拿了书卷”（第7节），而“羔羊”表示主的神性人。“里外都写着字”表示圣言的细节和总体，其中“里”表示细节，“外”表示总体。“里外”还表示圣言属灵的内在意义和和属世的外在意义。“右手”表示祂自己的全能和全知，因为所论述的是对将要受审判的天上和地上所有人的审查，以及他们的分离。主作为圣言，凭自己知道天上和地上所有人的生命状态，因为祂是神性真理本身，神性真理本身凭自己知道一切。不过，这是一个奥秘，这个奥秘在《圣爱与圣智》一书已揭开。主的永恒神性就是圣言，亦即神性真理。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>太初有道（即圣言），道与神同在，道就是神。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>）</p><p>主的人性也就变成了道（即圣言）：</p><p>道成了肉身。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">1:14</a>）</p><p>由此可知“坐宝座的右手里的书卷”和“从坐宝座的右手里拿了书卷的羔羊”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.7.htm">5:7</a>）是什么意思。</p><p>由于主是圣言，圣言又是神性真理，而神性真理总体上构成天堂和教会，具体地构成每位天使，以便天堂在主里面，教会也在祂里面，又因此处“书卷”表示圣言，所有人皆通过并照着书卷受审判，故经上常说“记在书卷上”、“按书卷受审判”、“从书卷上涂抹”等，这些话论述的是人的永生状态。如以下经文：</p><p>亘古常在者坐着行审判，书卷展开了。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.10.htm">7:10</a>）</p><p>你本国的民，凡记录在书卷上的，必得拯救。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但12.1.htm">12:1</a>）</p><p>我的骨并不向你隐藏，我所有的日子都记在你的书卷上，一无所缺。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗139.15.htm">139:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗139.16.htm">16</a>）</p><p>摩西说，求你从你所写的书卷上涂抹我的名。耶和华说，谁得罪我，我就从我的书卷上涂抹谁的名。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.32.htm">32:32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.33.htm">33</a>）</p><p>愿他们从生命的书卷上被涂抹，不得记录在义人之中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.28.htm">69:28</a>）</p><p>我看见案卷展开了，并且另有一卷展开，就是生命的书卷。死了的人都凭着这些案卷所记载的，照他们所行的受审判。若有人名字没有记在生命的书卷上，他就被扔在火湖里。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.12.htm">20:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.15.htm">15</a>）</p><p>只有名字写在羔羊生命书卷上的才得进新耶路撒冷。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.27.htm">21:27</a>）</p><p>凡名字没有记在羔羊生命书卷上的人，都要拜那兽。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.8.htm">13:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.8.htm">17:8</a>）</p><p>“书卷”表示圣言，诗篇：</p><p>我的事在书卷上已经记载了。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗40.7.htm">40:7</a>）</p><p>以西结书：</p><p>我观看，见有一只手向我伸出来，手中有一书卷，前后都写着字。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结2.9.htm">2:9</a>，<a

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 256</h4><p>256. CHAPTER 5<p>1. And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a book written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals.<p>2. Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and to loose its seals?"<p>3. And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book, or to look in it.<p>4. So I wept much, that no one was found worthy to open and read the book, or to look in it.<p>5. But one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the book and to loose its seven seals."<p>6. And I looked, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as though slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.<p>7. Then He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne.<p>8. Now when He had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a lyre, and a golden bowl full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.<p>9. And they sang a new song, saying, "You are worthy to take the book and to open its seals, because You were slain and have redeemed us to God by Your blood, out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,<p>10. and have made us kings and priests to our God; and we shall reign on the earth."<p>11. Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,<p>12. saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom, and... honor and glory and blessing!"<p>13. And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying, "Blessing and honor and glory and strength be to Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever!"<p>14. Then the four living creatures said, "Amen!" And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped Him who lives forever and ever.<p>THE SPIRITUAL MEANING<p>The Contents of the Whole Chapter<p>The meaning is that the Lord in His Divine humanity will execute a judgment based on the Word and in accordance with it, because He embodies the Word; and that all in the three heavens acknowledge this.<p>The Contents of the Individual Verses:<p></p><table><thead><tr><th>Verse Contents</th><th>Spiritual Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a book written inside and on the back,</td><td>The Lord in respect to His underlying Divinity from eternity, to whom belongs omnipotence and omniscience, and who embodies the Word,</td></tr><tr><td>sealed with seven seals.</td><td>the Word completely hidden from angel and man.</td></tr><tr><td>2. Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice,</td><td>Divine truth flowing in from the Lord deeply in angels and people.</td></tr><tr><td>"Who is worthy to open the book and to loose its seals?"</td><td>Who has the power to know the states of life of all in heaven and on earth and to judge each one according to his state?</td></tr><tr><td>3. And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able</td><td>No one in the higher heavens or in the lower heavens [had the power]</td></tr><tr><td>to open the book,</td><td>to know the states of life of all and to judge each one according to his state.</td></tr><tr><td>or to look in it.</td><td>Not the least power.</td></tr><tr><td>4. So I wept much, that no one was found worthy to open and read the book, or to look in it.</td><td>Grief of heart, that if no one could do this, all would perish.</td></tr><tr><td>5. But one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep.</td><td>Consolation.</td></tr><tr><td>Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed</td><td>The Lord, who by His own power conquered the hells and put everything into order when He was in the world, through the Divine goodness united to the Divine truth in His humanity.</td></tr><tr><td>to open the book and to loose its seven seals."</td><td>The same here as before [verses 2, 3].</td></tr><tr><td>6. And I looked, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders,</td><td>From the inmost elements of heaven, the Word, and the church, and so in all their constituents.</td></tr><tr><td>a Lamb standing as though slain,</td><td>The Lord in respect to His humanity not acknowledged in the church as Divine.</td></tr><tr><td>having seven horns</td><td>His omnipotence.</td></tr><tr><td>and seven eyes,</td><td>His omniscience and Divine wisdom,</td></tr><tr><td>which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.</td><td>that from it emanates Divine truth throughout the whole world, wherever religion is found.</td></tr><tr><td>7. Then He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne.</td><td>The Lord in respect to His Divine humanity embodies the Word, and this from His Divinity within Him, and thus He will execute judgment based on His Divine humanity.</td></tr><tr><td>8. Now when He had taken the book,</td><td>When the Lord prepared to execute judgment, and thereby put back into order everything in heaven and on earth.</td></tr><tr><td>the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb,</td><td>A humility and worship of the Lord on the part of the higher heavens.</td></tr><tr><td>each having a lyre,</td><td>A confession of the Lord's Divine humanity springing from spiritual truths.</td></tr><tr><td>and a golden bowl full of incense,</td><td>A confession of the Lord's Divine humanity springing from spiritual goods.</td></tr><tr><td>which are the prayers of the saints.</td><td>Thoughts that are matters of faith springing from affections that are matters of charity in people who worship the Lord in accord with spiritual goods and truths.</td></tr><tr><td>9. And they sang a new song,</td><td>An acknowledgment and glorification of the Lord as being the only judge, redeemer and savior, thus God of heaven and earth.</td></tr><tr><td>saying, "You are worthy to take the book and to open its seals,</td><td>The same here as before [verses 2, 3].</td></tr><tr><td>because You were slain and have redeemed us to God by Your blood,</td><td>Deliverance from hell and salvation by conjunction with Him.</td></tr><tr><td>out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,</td><td>The Lord has redeemed those in the church or in any other religion who are impelled by truths in respect to their doctrine and by goods in respect to their life.</td></tr><tr><td>10. and have made us kings and priests to our God;</td><td>They have from the Lord wisdom from Divine truths and love from Divine goods.</td></tr><tr><td>and we shall reign on the earth."</td><td>And they will dwell in His kingdom, He in them and they in Him.</td></tr><tr><td>11. Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders;</td><td>A confession and glorification of the Lord by angels of the lower heavens,</td></tr><tr><td>and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,</td><td>all possessing truths and goods.</td></tr><tr><td>12. saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom, and... honor and glory</td><td>A confession from the heart that to the Lord in His Divine humanity belong omnipotence, omniscience, Divine good and Divine truth -</td></tr><tr><td>and blessing!"</td><td>all these being in Him, and from Him in them.</td></tr><tr><td>13. And every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying,</td><td>A confession and glorification of the Lord by angels of the lowest heavens,</td></tr><tr><td>"Blessing and honor and glory and strength be to Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever!"</td><td>that present in the Lord from eternity and so in His Divine humanity is everything of heaven and the church - Divine good and truth, and Divine power - and that these are present in them from Him.</td></tr><tr><td>14. Then the four living creatures said, "Amen!"</td><td>A Divine confirmation from the Word.</td></tr><tr><td>And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped Him who lives forever and ever.</td><td>Humility before the Lord on the part of all in the heavens, and out of humility worship of Him, from whom and in whom is eternal life.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>THE EXPOSITION<p>And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a book written inside and on the back. (<a href="3927/revelation_5_1.htm">5:1</a>) This symbolizes the Lord in respect to His underlying Divinity from eternity, to whom belongs omnipotence and omniscience, and who embodies the Word, who also of Himself knows the states of life of all in heaven and on earth, in every particular and in their entirety.<p>He who sat on the throne means the Lord in respect to His underlying Divinity from which His humanity originates, for the statement follows that the Lamb took the book out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne (verse 7), and the Lamb means the Lord in respect to His humanity. The book written inside and on the back means the Word in every particular and in its entirety - "inside" meaning in every particular, and "on the back," in its entirety. Inside and on the back also mean the inner meaning of the Word, which is spiritual, and its outer meaning, which is natural. The right hand means the Lord in respect to His omnipotence and omniscience, because the subject is the exploration of all in heaven and on earth on whom the Last Judgment would fall, and their separation.<p>As the embodiment of the Word, the Lord knows of Himself the states of life of all in heaven and on earth, because He is Divine truth itself, and Divine truth itself, of itself, knows everything. This, however, is a secret which we disclosed in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom.<p>The fact that the Lord was the Word, that is to say, Divine truth, in respect to His Divinity from eternity is apparent from this statement in John:<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>)<p>And the fact that the Lord came to embody the Word even in respect to His humanity, from this statement also in John:<p>And the Word became flesh... (<a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">John 1:14</a>)<p>It can be seen from this what is meant by the testimony that the book was in right hand of Him who sat on the throne, and that the Lamb took the book from it (verse 7).</p><p>[2] Since the Lord embodies the Word, and the Word is the Divine truth which forms heaven and the church in general, and each angel in particular so as to have heaven in him, and each person so as to have the church in him, and because the Word is here meant by the book on the basis of which and according to which all are to be judged, therefore we find references here and there to being written in the book, to being judged on the basis of the book, and to being blotted out from the book, where the subject is someone's state of eternal life, as in the following places:<p>(The Ancient of Days) sat in judgment, and the books were opened. (<a href="3927/daniel_7_10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>)<p>...your people shall be delivered, every one who is found written in the book. (<a href="3927/daniel_12_1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>)<p>My frame was not hidden from You... ...on Your book were written all the days..., and not one of them is missing. (<a href="3927/psalms_139_15.htm">Psalms 139:15-16</a>)<p>(Moses said,) ."..I pray, blot me out of Your book which You have written." And Jehovah said..., "He who has sinned against Me, him I will blot out of My book." (<a href="3927/exodus_32_32.htm">Exodus 32:32-33</a>)<p>Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the righteous. (<a href="3927/psalms_69_28.htm">Psalms 69:28</a>)<p>I saw (that) books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to the things which were written in the Book, according to their works..., and if anyone was not found written in the Book of Life, he was cast into the lake of fire. (<a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Revelation 20:12-15</a>)<p>There shall not enter into (the New Jerusalem) anything... but those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life. (<a href="3927/revelation_21_27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>)<p>All... will worship (the beast), whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb... (<a href="3927/revelation_13_8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>, cf. <a href="3927/revelation_17_8.htm">17:8</a>)<p>That the Book means the Word may be seen in the book of Psalms:<p>In the scroll of the book it is written of me. (<a href="3927/psalms_40_7.htm">Psalms 40:7</a>)<p>And in Ezekiel:<p>I looked, and lo, there was a hand stretched out to me, and... in it the scroll of a book... written in front and in back... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_2_9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9-10</a>)<p>...the book of the words of Isaiah... (<a href="3927/luke_3_4.htm">Luke 3:4</a>)<p>...the Book of Psalms...

And I saw in the right hand of the One Sitting upon the throne a book written on the inside and on the back (a tergo), sealed with seven seals.<p>2. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?<p>3. And in one in heaven, nor upon the land, nor yet under the land, was able to open the book, and to look into it.<p>4. And I was weeping much, because no one was found to open and to read the book, and to look into it.<p>5. And one of the elders says unto me, Do not weep; behold the Lion has prevailed, Who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof.<p>6. And I saw, and behold in the midst of the throne, and of the four animals, and in the midst of the elders a LAMB standing as if slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into every land.<p>7. And He came and took the book out of the right hand of the One sitting upon the throne.<p>8. And when He had taken the book, the four animals and the twenty-four elders fell prostrate before the LAMB, each one of them having harps, and golden phials full of incense-offerings, which are the prayers of the saints.<p>9. And they were singing a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof, because Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to GOD in Thy blood, out of every tribe and tongue, and people and nation.<p>10. And Thou hast made us to our GOD kings and priests, and we shall reign over the land.<p>11. And I saw and heard the voice of many angels around the throne, and the animals, and the elders, and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands.<p>12. Saying with a great voice, Worthy is the slain LAMB to take power, and riches, and wisdom, and honour and glory, and blessing.<p>13. And every created thing that is in heaven and in the land, and under the land, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, To the One sitting upon the throne and to the Lamb, blessing and honour and glory and strength for ages of ages.<p>14. And the four animals were saying, Amen; and the twenty-four elders fell prostrate and adored the One living for ages of ages.<p>THE SPIRITUAL SENSE<p>THE CONTENTS OF THE WHOLE CHAPTER<p>That the Lord in the Divine Human is going to make a judgment out of the Word and in accordance therewith, because He is the Word; and that this is acknowledged by all in the three heavens.<p>THE CONTENTS OF EACH OF THE VERSES<p>1. And I saw in the right hand of the One sitting upon the throne a book written on the inside and on the back (a tergo), signifies the Lord as to His Divine Itself from eternity, Who has Omnipotence and Omniscience, and Who is the Word.<p>Sealed with seven seals, signifies this altogether hidden away from angel and man.<p>2. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, signifies Divine Truth from the Lord inflowing inwardly with angels and men.<p>Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof?, signifies Who is in the power of getting to know the states of life of all in the heavens and on earth (in terris), and of judging each one in accordance with his own [state]?<p>3. And no one in heaven, nor upon the land, nor yet under the land, was able, signifies that none in the higher heavens and in the lower heavens was able.<p>To open the book, signifies to get to know the states of life of all, and to judge each one in accordance with his own [state].<p>Nor to look into it, signifies not at all.<p>4. And I was weeping much, because no one [worthy] was found to open the book, nor to look into it, signifies grief of heart because if there should not be anyone able [to do this] all would perish.<p>5. And one of the elders says unto me, Do not weep, signifies consolation.<p>Behold, the Lion has overcome, Who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, signifies the Lord, that out of His own power He subjugated the hells, and brought all things back into order when He was in the world, by means of Divine Good united with Divine Truth in His Human.<p>To open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof., signifies here as before.<p>6. And I saw, and behold in the midst of the throne, and of the four animals, and in the midst of the elders, signifies from the inmosts, and thence in all things of heaven, of the Word, and of the Church.<p>A Lamb standing as if slain, signifies the Lord as to the Human not acknowledged in the Church to be Divine.<p>Having seven horns, signifies His Omnipotence.<p>And seven eyes, signifies His Omniscience and Divine Wisdom.<p>Which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into every land, signifies that out of that [Divine Wisdom] there is Divine Truth throughout all the lands where there is religion.<p>7. And He came and took the book out of the right hand of the One sitting upon the throne, signifies that the Lord as to His Divine Human is the Word, and that He is this out of His Divine in Itself, and that therefore He is going to effect the judgment out of the Divine Human.<p>8. And when He had taken the book, signifies when the Lord set about making the judgment, and bringing all things in the heavens and upon earth back into order by means of it.<p>The four animals and the twenty-four elders fell prostrate before the Lamb, signifies a humbling, and the adoration of the Lord out of the higher heavens.<p>Each one of them having harps, signifies the confession of the Lord's Divine Human out of spiritual truths.<p>And golden phials full of incense-offerings, signifies the confession of the Lord's Divine Human out of spiritual goods.<p>Which are the prayers of the saints, signifies the thoughts that are of faith derived from the affections that are of charity with those who worship the Lord out of spiritual goods and truths.<p>9. And they were singing a new song, signifies an acknowledgment and glorification of the Lord, because He Only is the Judge, Redeemer, and Saviour thus the God of heaven and earth.<p>Saying, Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof, signifies here as before.<p>Because Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God in Thy blood, signifies liberation from hell, and salvation by means of conjunction with Himself.<p>Out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, signifies that those who, in the Church or any religion, are in truths as to doctrine and in goods as to life, have been redeemed by the Lord.<p>10.

Saying with a great voice, Worthy is the slain Lamb to take power and riches and wisdom and honour and glory, signifies confession out of the heart, that the Lord as to the Divine Human has Omnipotence, Omniscience, Divine Good and Divine Truth.<p>And blessing, signifies all these in Him, and from Him in those [angels].<p>13. And every created thing that is in heaven and in the land, and under the land, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, signifies a confession and glorification of the Lord by the angels of the lowest heavens.<p>To the One sitting upon the throne and to the Lamb, blessing and honour and glory and strength for ages of ages, signifies that in the Lord from eternity, and consequently in His Divine Human, is everything of heaven and the Church, Divine Good and Divine Truth, and Divine Power, and from Him in those [who are in heaven and the Church].<p>14. And the four animals were saying, Amen, signifies Divine confirmation out of the Word.<p>And the twenty-four elders fell prostrate and adored the One living for ages of ages, signifies a humbling before the Lord, and as a result of the humbling the adoration by all the heavens, of Him from Whom and in Whom is eternal life.<p>THE EXPOSITION<p>[verse 1] 'And I saw in the right hand of the One sitting upon the throne a book written on the inside and on the back (a tergo)' signifies the Lord as to His Divine Itself from eternity, Who has Omnipotence and Omniscience, and Who is the Word, Who also of Himself (ex Se ipso) has knowledge of the states of life of all in the heavens and on earth (in lerris), in everything particular and in everything general. By 'the One sitting upon the throne' is understood the Lord as to the Divine Itself, out of which is His Human, for it follows on (verse 7) that 'the Lamb took the book out of the right hand of the One sitting upon the throne'; and by 'the Lamb' is understood the Lord as to the Divine Human. By 'a book written on the inside and on the back' is understood the Word in everything particular and in everything general; by 'on the inside' in everything particular, and by 'on the back' in everything general. By 'on the inside and on the back' is understood also the Word's interior sense which is spiritual, and its exterior sense, which is natural. By the right hand' is understood Himself as to Omnipotence and Omniscience, because it treats of the examination of all, in the heavens and on earth (in terris), upon whom there will be a last judgment, and of their separation. The Lord as the Word from Himself (a Se Ipso) knows the states of all in the heavens and on earth, because He is Divine Truth Itself, and Divine Truth Itself has knowledge of all things of Itself (ex Se ipso). But this is an arcanum which has been uncovered in ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM. That the Lord as to the Divine Itself from eternity was the Word, that is, Divine Truth, is plain from these [words] in John:<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, <a href="3927/john_2_1.htm">John 2</a>; also that the Lord was made the Word even as to His Human in the same:<p>And the Word was made flesh. <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">John 1:14</a>.<p>From this it can be established what is understood by [the statement] that the book was 'in the right hand of the One sitting upon the throne,' and that the Lamb 'took the book' therefrom (verse 7).</p><p>[2] Since the Lord is the Word, and the Word is Divine Truth, which in general makes heaven and the Church, and in particular makes an angel so that heaven may be in him, and a man so that the Church may be in him; and because the Word is here understood by 'the book' out of which and in accordance with which all are to be judged, it is therefore said in different places 'to be written in the book,' 'to be judged out of the book,' 'to be blotted out of the book,' where it treats of anyone's eternal life; as in these places:<p>The Ancient of days did sit in judgment, and the books were opened. <a href="3927/daniel_7_9.htm">Daniel 7:9-10</a>.<p>Every people shall be delivered that shall be found written in the book <a href="3927/daniel_12_1.htm">Daniel 12</a>.<p>My bone was not hid from Thee; upon Thy book all the days have been written, and not one of them is missing. <a href="3927/psalms_139_15.htm">Psalms 139:15-16</a>.<p>Moses said, Blot me, I pray Thee, out of the book which Thou hast written, and Jehovah said, Him who has sinned against Me, will I blot out of the book. <a href="3927/exodus_32_32.htm">Exodus 32:32-33</a>.<p>Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the just. <a href="3927/psalms_69_28.htm">Psalms 69:28</a>.<p>I saw that the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is of life, and the dead were judged according to the things that were written in the book according to their works, and if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast out into the lake of fire. <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Revelation 20:12-15</a>.<p>None shall enter into the New Jerusalem, unless they are written in the Lamb's book of life. <a href="3927/revelation_21_27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a> [Schmidt, <a href="3927/revelation_21_26.htm">26</a>].<p>All shall adore the beast, whose names have not been written in the Lamb's book of life. <a href="3927/revelation_13_8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_17_8.htm">17:8</a>.<p>That by 'the book 'is understood the Word [may be seen] in David:<p>In the roll of the book it has been written of Me. <a href="3927/psalms_40_7.htm">Psalms 40:7</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_40_8.htm">8</a>].<p>And in Ezekiel:<p>I saw and behold a hand sent forth unto me, and in it the roll of a book written on the front and the back. <a href="3927/ezekiel_2_9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9-10</a>.<p>The book of the words of Isaiah. <a href="3927/luke_3_4.htm">Luke 3:4</a>.<p>The book of Psalms. <a href="3927/luke_20_42.htm">Luke 20:42</a>. </p>

And I saw in the right hand of Him that sat on the throne a book, written within and on the back, signifies the Lord as to His Divine Itself from eternity, who has omnipotence and omniscience, and who is the Word; who also knows from Himself the state of the life of all in the heavens and on the earths, in every particular and in general. By "Him that sat on the throne" is meant the Lord as to His Divine, from which is His Human, for it follows that "the Lamb took the book out of the right hand of Him that sat on the throne" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_5_7.htm">7</a>), and by "the Lamb" is meant the Lord as to the Divine Human. By "the book written within and on the back" is meant the Word in every particular and in every general; by "within," in every particular, and by "on the back" in every general. By "within and on the back" is also meant the interior sense of the Word, which is spiritual, and its exterior sense, which is natural; by "right hand" is meant Himself as to omnipotence and omniscience, because the exploration of all in the heavens and on the earths, upon whom the Last Judgment is to be executed, and their separation, is treated of. The Lord, as the Word, knows the states of life of all in the heavens and on the earths from Himself, because He is the Divine truth itself, and the Divine truth itself knows all things from itself; but this is an arcanum, which is revealed in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Love and Wisdom. That the Lord as to His Divine from eternity was the Word, that is, the Divine truth, is evident from these words in John:<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word, (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>).<p>And that the Lord as to His Human also was made "the Word," in the same:<p>And the Word became flesh, (<a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p>Hence it may appear what it means that the book was in the right hand of Him that sat on the throne, and that the Lamb took the book thence, (<a href="3927/revelation_5_7.htm">Revelation 5:7</a>).</p><p><p>[2] Since the Lord is the Word, and the Word is the Divine truth, which in general makes heaven and the church, and in particular each angel, that heaven may be in Him, and man that the church may be in Him; and because the Word is here meant by "the book," from which and according to which all are to be judged, therefore in many places occur the expressions, "to be written in the book," "to be judged from the book," "to be blotted out of the book," where the state of eternal life of anyone is treated of, as in these passages:<p>The Ancient of days did sit in judgment, and the books were opened, (<a href="3927/daniel_7_10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>).<p>Every people shall be delivered that shall be found written in the book, (<a href="3927/daniel_12_1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>).<p>My bone was not hid from Thee, in Thy book all my days were written, not one of them is wanting, (<a href="3927/psalms_139_15.htm">Psalms 139:15-16</a>).<p>Moses said, blot me, I pray thee, out of the book which Thou hast written. And Jehovah said, Whosoever hath sinned against Me will I blot out of the book, (<a href="3927/exodus_32_32.htm">Exodus 32:32-33</a>).<p>Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the just, (<a href="3927/psalms_69_28.htm">Psalms 69:28</a>).<p>I saw that the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged according to those things which were written in the book according to their works, and whosoever was not found written in the book of life, was cast into the lake of fire, (<a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_15.htm">15</a>).<p>None shall enter into the New Jerusalem, but them that are written in the Lamb's book of life, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>).<p>All shall adore the beast whose names are not written in the Lamb's book of life, (<a href="3927/revelation_13_8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_17_8.htm">17:8</a>).<p>That by "the book" is meant the Word, in David:<p>In the volume of the book it is written of me, (<a href="3927/psalms_40_7.htm">Psalms 40:7</a>).<p>And in Ezekiel:<p>I saw, and behold a hand sent forth unto me, and in it the volume of a book, written before and behind, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_2_9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9-10</a>).<p>The book of the words of Isaiah, (<a href="3927/luke_3_4.htm">Luke 3:4</a>).<p>The book of Psalms, (<a href="3927/luke_20_42.htm">Luke 20:42</a>). </p>

"Et vidi in dextra Sedentis super Throno Librum scriptum intus et a tergo," significat Dominum quoad Ipsum Divinum Suum ab aeterno, Cui Omnipotentia et Omniscientia, et Qui est Verbum, Qui et status vitae omnium in Caelis et in terris, in omni particulari et in omni communi, ex Se Ipso novit. - Per "Sedentem super Throno" intelligitur Dominus quoad Ipsum Divinum, ex Quo Humanum Ipsius, nam sequitur quod" Agnus acceperit Librum e dextra Sedentis super Throno," (vers. 7), et per "Agnum" intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum; per "Librum scriptum intus et a tergo" intelligitur Verbum in omni particulari et in omni communi; per "intus" in omni particulari, et per "a tergo" in omni communi; per "intus et a tergo" intelligitur etiam Verbi Sensus interior, qui est spiritualis, et Sensus ejus exterior qui est naturalis; per "dextram" intelligitur Ipse quoad omnipotentiam et omniscientiam, quia de exploratione omnium in Caelis et in terris, super quos Ultimum Judicium erit, et de separatione eorum, agitur. Quod Dominus ut Verbum sciat status vitae omnium in Caelis et in terris a Se Ipso, est quia est Ipsum Divinum Verum, et Ipsum Divinum Verum ex Se Ipso novit omnia; sed hoc arcanum est, quod in Sapientia Angelica de Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia detectum est. Quod Dominus quoad Ipsum Divinum ab aeterno fuerit Verbum, hoc est, Divinum Verum, patet ab his apud Johannem: <p>"In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_1" target=_top>1:1</a>);<p>et quod Dominus etiam quoad Humanum factus sit "Verbum," apud eundem: <p>"Et Verbum Caro factum est," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_14" target=_top>1:14</a>).<p>Inde constare potest quid intelligitur per quod Liber fuerit in dextra Sedentis super Throno, et quod Agnus acceperit Librum inde (vers. 7). Quoniam Dominus est Verbum, et Verbum est Divinum Verum, quod in communi facit Caelum et Ecclesiam, et in particulari angelum ut in illo Caelum sit, et hominem ut in illo Ecclesia sit, et quia Verbum hic intelligitur per "Librum," ex quo et secundum quod omnes judicandi sunt, ideo passim dicitur "inscribi Libro," "judicari ex Libro," "deleri ex Libro," ubi de statu vitae aeternae alicujus agitur; ut in his locis: <p>Antiquus Dierum judicium consedit, "et Libri aperti sunt," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_7_1-28" target=_top>Daniel 7</a> (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_7_9" target=_top>9</a>,) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_7_10" target=_top>10</a>);<p>Eripietur populus omnis, qui invenietur "scriptus In Libro," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_12_1-13" target=_top>Daniel 12</a> (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_12_9" target=_top>9</a>));<p>"Non latuit Te os meum, super Libro Tuo omnes scripti sunt dies, et non unus ex illis deest," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_139_15-16" target=_top>Psalm 139:15-16</a>);<p>Moses dixit, "Dele me quaeso ex Libro quem scripsisti; et dixit Jehovah, Illum qui peccavit Mihi, delebo e Libro," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_32_32-33" target=_top>Exodus 32:32-33</a>) <p>"Deleantur e Libro vitae, et cum justis non scribantur," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_69_29" target=_top>Psalm 69:29</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_69_28" target=_top>28</a>));<p>"Vidi quod Libri aperti sint; et Liber alius apertus est, qui est vitae; et judicati sunt mortui juxta ea quae scripta sunt in libris <sup>4</sup>secundum opera illorum, et si quis non inventus est in Libri vitae scriptus, ejectus est in stagnum ignis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_12" target=_top>Apocalypsis 20:12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_15" target=_top>15</a>); <sup>5</sup><p>"Non ingredientur in Novam Hierosolymam, nisi qui scripti sunt in Libro vitae Agni," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_26" target=_top>Apocalypsis 21:26</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_27" target=_top>27</a>));<p>"Adorabunt bestiam omnes, quorum nomina non scripta sunt in Libro vitae Agni," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_13_8" target=_top>Apocalypsis 13:8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_17_8" target=_top>17:8</a>).<p>Quod per "Librum" intelligatur Verbum, apud Davidem: <p>"In Volumine Libri scriptum est de Me," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_40_8" target=_top>Psalm 40:8</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_40_7" target=_top>7</a>));<p>et apud Ezechielem: <p>"Vidi et ecce manus emissa ad me, et in ea Volumen Libri scriptum ante et post," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_2_9-10" target=_top>2:9-10</a>); <sup>6</sup><p>"Liber verborum Esajae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_3_4" target=_top>Luca 3:4</a>);<p>"Liber psalmorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_20_42" target=_top>Luca 20:42</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;nec pro "et"<p>2.&nbsp;CONTENTA pro "CONTENTUM"<p>3.&nbsp;dicit pro "dixit"<p>4.&nbsp;libris pro "libro"<p>5.&nbsp;12, 15 pro "12, 13, 14"<p>6.&nbsp;9, 10 pro "8, 9" </p>
