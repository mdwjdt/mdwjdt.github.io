<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第266节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>266.“犹大支派的，大卫的根”表通过将神性良善与祂人性中的神性真理结合。在圣言中，“犹大”表示处于对主之爱的良善的教会，在至高意义上表示主的神性之爱的神性良善；“大卫”表示主的神性智慧的神性真理。“大卫”表示主的神性智慧的神性真理，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》（<a href="../lord/43.htm">43</a>，<a href="../lord/44.htm">44</a>节）一书；“犹大”表示主的神性之爱的神性良善（参看<a href="96.htm">96</a>，<a href="266.htm">266</a>，<a href="350.htm">350</a>节）。由此可知，“看哪，犹大支派中的狮子，大卫的根，他已得胜”表示主通过将神性良善与祂人性中的神性真理结合而征服地狱，使一切恢复秩序。这就是这些话的含义，这一点从字义是看不出来的。字义只是说主亲自降生世间，属犹大支派大卫一系。然而，这些话包含灵义在里面，如前面常说的，当中的人名皆表示真实事物，因而“犹大”不是指犹大，而是指主的神性良善，“大卫”不是指大卫，而是指主的神性真理。灵义由此而来。之所以在此解释这灵义，是因为启示录的灵义现已揭开。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 266</h4><p>266. "Of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David." This symbolically means, through the Divine goodness united to the Divine truth in His humanity.<p>In the Word, Judah means a church governed by the goodness of love toward the Lord, and in the highest sense the Lord Himself in respect to the Divine goodness of His Divine love; and David means the Lord in respect to the Divine truth of His Divine wisdom. That the first is the meaning of Judah may be seen in nos. <a href="96.htm">96</a> and <a href="350.htm">350</a>, and that the latter is the meaning of David, in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord, nos. <a href="43.htm">43</a>, <a href="44.htm">44</a>.<p>It is apparent from this that "Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed" symbolically means that the Lord overcame the hells and put everything into order through the Divine goodness united to the Divine truth in His humanity.<p>In the literal sense it cannot be seen that this is the meaning of these words, but only that it is the Lord who was born in the world of the tribe of Judah and of the lineage of David. But still these same words carry within them a spiritual sense, in which people's names have meanings, as we have said here and there above. Thus Judah does not mean Judah, nor David, David, but Judah means the Lord in respect to Divine good, and David the Lord in respect to Divine truth. It is because of this that the spiritual meaning is thus formed. We are here setting forth that meaning, because the book of Revelation is now being opened in respect to its spiritual meaning. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 266</h4><p>266. 'Who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David' signifies by means of Divine Good united with Divine Truth in His Human. By 'Judah 'in the Word is understood a Church that is in the good of love directed to the Lord, and in the supreme sense the Lord as to the Divine Good of Divine Love, and by 'David 'is understood the Lord as to the Divine Truth of Divine Wisdom. That this is understood by 'David 'may be seen in <a href="../lord/43.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD 43-44</a>; and that the former is understood by 'Judah' may be seen (<a href="96.htm">96</a>, <a href="350.htm">350</a>). In consequence of these things it is plain that by 'Behold the Lion has overcome Who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David' is signified that the Lord overcame the hells and brought all things back into order by means of Divine Good united with Divine Truth in His Human. That this is the sense of those words cannot be seen in the sense of the letter, but only that it is He Himself Who was born in the world of the tribe of Judah and of the lineage of David. Nevertheless these same words contain in themselves a spiritual sense in which things are understood by means of the names of persons, as has been said here and there above; thus, by 'Judah' is not understood Judah, nor David by 'David,' but by 'Judah' the Lord as to Divine Good, and by 'David' the Lord as to Divine Truth. That [spiritual] sense results as a consequence of this. That sense is set out here, because the Apocalypse as to its spiritual sense is now being opened. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 266</h4><p>266. Which is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, signifies by the Divine good united to the Divine truth in His Human. By "Judah," in the Word, is meant the church which is in the good of love to the Lord, and in the highest sense the Lord as to the Divine good of the Divine love; and by "David" is meant the Lord as to the Divine truth of the Divine wisdom. That this is meant by "David," may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord, (<a href="43.htm">43</a>, <a href="44.htm">44</a>); and that the former is meant by "Judah," may be seen, (<a href="96.htm">96</a>, <a href="266.htm">266</a>, <a href="350.htm">350</a>). Hence it appears that by "Behold the Lion which is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David hath prevailed," is signified that the Lord overcame the hells and reduced all things to order by the Divine good united to the Divine truth in His Human. That this is the sense of these words, cannot be seen in the sense of the letter, but only that it is He Himself who was born in the world of the tribe of Judah and of the stock of David. Still, however, these words contain in them a spiritual sense, in which by the names of persons are meant things, as has frequently been observed above, thus by "Judah" is not meant Judah, nor by "David," David; but by "Judah," the Lord as to the Divine good, and by "David," the Lord as to the Divine truth. Hence it is that this sense results therefrom. The reason why this sense is here explained is because Revelation as to its spiritual sense is now opened. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 266 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>266. "Qui est ex tribu Jehudae, Radix Davidis," significat per Divinum Bonum unitum Divino Vero in Suo Humano. - Per "Jehudam" in Verbo intelligitur Ecclesia quae in bono amoris in Dominum est, ac in supremo Sensu Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris, et per "Davidem" intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum Divinae Sapientiae: quod hoc per "Davidem" intelligatur, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_266/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_43" target=_top>Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 43</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_266/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_44" target=_top>44</a>; <sup>1</sup>et quod illud per "Jehudam," videatur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_266/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_96" target=_top>96</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_266/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_350" target=_top>350</a>). Ex his patet, quod per "Ecce vicit Leo, Qui ex tribu Jehudae, Radix Davidis," significetur quod Dominus vicerit Inferna et redegerit omnia in ordinem per Divinum Bonum unitum Divino Vero in Suo Humano. Quod hic sensus illorum verborum sit, non videri potest in Sensu literae, sed solum quod Ipse Ille sit Qui ex tribu Jehudae et ex prosapia Davidis in mundo natus est; at usque eadem illa verba Sensum spiritualem in se continent, in quo per nomina personarum intelliguntur res, ut passim supra dictum est; ita non per "Jehudam" Jehudah, nec per "Davidem" David; sed per "Jehudam" Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum, et per "Davidem" Dominus quoad Divinum Verum; inde est quod ille sensus inde resultet; quod ille sensus hic exponatur, est quia Apocalypsis quoad Sensum spiritualem nunc aperitur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;44 pro "48" </p>
