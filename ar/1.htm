align="center">解读</h4><p>1.迄今为止，没有人知道何为属灵之义（简称灵义）。圣言的每一处细节都含有灵义，没有灵义，许多经文无法理解，这一点在《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/5.htm">5-26</a>节）已经说明。灵义不显于字义，因为它在字义中，犹如灵魂在身体中。人们知道有属灵之物和属世之物，属灵之物流入属世之物，以可见可触的形式呈现在视觉和触觉之下。没有这类形式，属灵之物就仅以情感与思维，或属心智的爱与智慧的形式得以感受。人们承认，情感与思维，或情感所属的爱与思维所属的智慧都是属灵的。灵魂的这两大官能在身体中以所谓的感觉器官和运动器官的形式呈现自身，这一事实是人所共知的。两者合而为一，并且是这样的一体，以致心之所想嘴巴马上就说出来，心之所愿身体马上就行出来。由此可见，属灵之物和属世之物在人身上有一个完美的融合。世上的每一个及一切事物都是如此。它们里面既有属灵之物，也有属世之物，这二者合而为一；其中，属灵之物是起因的至内层，而属世之物则是其结果。属灵之物未显现于属世之物，因为属灵之物在属世之物里面，犹如灵魂在身体里面，还犹如起因的至内层在结果里面，如前所述。圣言也是如此，其核心乃是属灵的，因为它就是神性，这是无可否认的。但由于属灵之物未显现于字义，也就是属世之义，故灵义迄今不为人知；在主揭示纯正的真理之前，它也无法为人所知，因为灵义就在这些真理里面。这就是为何启示录至今不为人理解。不过，为免有人怀疑圣言蕴含这类事物，解释细节并引用圣言别处经文以作证明是必须的。下面就是解读和论证。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 1</h4><p>1. THE APOCALYPSE OR BOOK OF REVELATION<p>CHAPTER 1<p>1. The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show His servants things which must shortly take place. And He sent and signified it by His angel to His servant John,<p>2. who bore witness to the Word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to whatever he saw.<p>3. Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it, for the time is near.<p>4. John, to the seven churches which are in Asia:<p>Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before His throne,<p>5. and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth, who loves us and washes us from our sins in His blood,<p>6. and makes us kings and priests to His God and Father. To Him be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.<p>7. Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even they who pierced Him, and all the tribes of the earth will wail because of Him. Even so, Amen.<p>8. "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End," says the Lord, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.<p>9. I, John, who am also your brother and your companion in the tribulation and kingdom and patient awaiting of Jesus Christ, was on the island called Patmos for the Word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.<p>10. I became in the spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet,<p>11. saying, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last. What you see, write in a book and send it to the churches which are in Asia - Ephesus and Smyrna, Pergamum and Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea."<p>12. Then I turned to see the voice that spoke with me, and having turned I saw seven golden lampstands,<p>13. and in the midst of the seven lampstands one like the Son of Man, clothed with a long robe and girded about the breasts with a golden girdle.<p>14. His head and hair were white, like wool as white as snow, and His eyes like a flame of fire.<p>15. His feet were like fine brass, as though fired in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters;<p>16. having in His right hand seven stars, and issuing from His mouth a sharp two-edged sword, and His countenance as the sun shines in its power.<p>17. And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as though dead. But He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last,<p>18. and am He who lives, and was put to death, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of hell and death.<p>19. Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after this.<p>20. The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches."<p>THE SPIRITUAL MEANING<p>The Contents of the Whole Chapter:<p>The meaning is that this revelation comes from the Lord alone, and is received by people who will be in His New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, and who will acknowledge the Lord as God of heaven and earth. The Lord also is described in relation to the Word.<p>-----<p>The Contents of the Individual Verses:<p></p><table><thead><tr><th>Verse Contents</th><th>Spiritual Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.

John, to the seven churches </td><td>To all who are in the Christian world where the Word exists and where through it the Lord is known, and who turn to the church, </td></tr><tr><td>which are in Asia: </td><td>to those who from the Word possess the light of truth. </td></tr><tr><td>Grace to you and peace </td><td>A Divine salutation </td></tr><tr><td>from Him who is and who was and who is to come, </td><td>from the Lord who is eternal and infinite, and who is Jehovah, </td></tr><tr><td>and from the seven spirits who are before His throne, </td><td>from the whole of heaven, where the Lord is in His Divine truth, </td></tr><tr><td>5. and from Jesus Christ, </td><td>His Divine humanity, </td></tr><tr><td>the faithful witness, </td><td>which is Divine truth itself, </td></tr><tr><td>the firstborn from the dead, </td><td>and which is Divine good itself, </td></tr><tr><td>and the ruler of the kings of the earth, </td><td>from whom originates all truth from good in the church, </td></tr><tr><td>who loves us and washes us from our sins in His blood, </td><td>who out of love and mercy reforms and regenerates people by His Divine truths drawn from the Word, </td></tr><tr><td>6. and makes us kings and priests </td><td>who grants those who are born from Him, that is, who are reborn or regenerated, to possess wisdom from Divine truths, and love from Divine goods, </td></tr><tr><td>to His God and Father. </td><td>thus images of His Divine wisdom and of His Divine love, </td></tr><tr><td>To Him be glory and might forever and ever. </td><td>to whom alone belong Divine majesty and Divine omnipotence to eternity. </td></tr><tr><td>Amen. </td><td>A Divine confirmation springing from truth, thus from Himself. </td></tr><tr><td>7.

His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, </td><td>The Divine love accompanying Divine wisdom in first things and last. </td></tr><tr><td>and His eyes like a flame of fire. </td><td>The Divine wisdom accompanying Divine love. </td></tr><tr><td>15. His feet were like fine brass, as though fired in a furnace, </td><td>Natural Divine good. </td></tr><tr><td>and His voice as the sound of many waters; </td><td>Natural Divine truth. </td></tr><tr><td>16. having in His right hand seven stars, </td><td>All concepts of goodness and truth in the Word from the Lord. </td></tr><tr><td>and issuing from His mouth a sharp two-edged sword, </td><td>A dispersion of falsities by the Lord by means of the Word and doctrine drawn from it. </td></tr><tr><td>and His countenance as the sun shining in its power. </td><td>The Divine love and wisdom which are the Lord and which emanate from Him. </td></tr><tr><td>17. And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as though dead. </td><td>A failure of his own life owing to such a presence of the Lord. </td></tr><tr><td>But He laid His right hand on me, </td><td>Life then infused from the Lord. </td></tr><tr><td>saying to me, "Do not be afraid. </td><td>A revival, and from the deepest humility then, adoration. </td></tr><tr><td>"I am the First and the Last, </td><td>He is eternal and infinite, thus the only God, </td></tr><tr><td>18. and am He who lives, </td><td>who alone is life, and the only source of life. </td></tr><tr><td>and was put to death, </td><td>Disregarded in the church, and His Divine humanity not acknowledged, </td></tr><tr><td>and behold, I am alive forevermore. </td><td>He is eternal life. </td></tr><tr><td>"Amen." </td><td>A Divine confirmation that it is the truth. </td></tr><tr><td>"And I have the keys of hell and death." </td><td>He alone is able to save. </td></tr><tr><td>19. "Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after this. </td><td>So that everything now being revealed may be saved for posterity. </td></tr><tr><td>20. "The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: </td><td>The secrets contained in the visions having to do with a new heaven and a new church. </td></tr><tr><td>"The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, </td><td>A new church in the heavens, which is the New Heaven. </td></tr><tr><td>and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches." </td><td>A new church on earth, which is the New Jerusalem descending from the Lord out of the New Heaven.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>THE EXPOSITION<p>People have hitherto not known what the spiritual meaning is. We have shown in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="../ss/5.htm">5-26</a>, that it exists in every constituent of the Word, and that in many places the Word cannot be understood apart from it. This meaning is not apparent in the literal sense, for it is present in it as the soul is in the body.<p>People do know that there is a spiritual reality and a natural one, and that the spiritual one flows into the natural one and presents itself to be seen and felt in forms that fall within the scope of people's vision and touch. Moreover, they know that apart from these forms the spiritual component is perceived only as affection and thought, or as love and wisdom, which are properties of the mind. They acknowledge that affection and thought, or love, which has the capacity to be affected, and wisdom, which has the capacity to think, are spiritual. They know that these two faculties of the soul present themselves in forms in the body that are called sensory and motor organs, and furthermore, that these forms operate in harmony with those faculties, so much so that when the mind thinks something, the mouth in an instant expresses it, and when the mind wills something, the body in an instant does it. It is apparent, therefore, that there is a perfect union of spiritual and natural components in the human being.</p><p>[2] The case is the same with each and every constituent of the world. Each has in it something spiritual as the inmost of its cause, and something natural as its effect, and these two function as one. Moreover, the spiritual component is not apparent in the natural one, because, as we said, it is present in the natural one as the soul is in the body and as the inmost of a cause is in the effect.<p>It is the same with the Word. Because it is Divine, no one can deny that it is spiritual at its core. But because the spiritual component is not apparent in the literal sense, which is natural, therefore the spiritual meaning has been hitherto unknown. Nor could it have been known previously, before the Lord revealed genuine truths, as the spiritual meaning consists in those truths.<p>It is on this account that the book of Revelation has heretofore not been understood. But lest there be any doubt that it contains such truths, its contents must be explained phrase by phrase and demonstrated by similar passages elsewhere in the Word. The explanation and demonstration now follow. </p>

In <a href="../ss/5.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 5-26</a>, it has been shown that that sense is in the details of the Word, and that without it the Word in many places cannot be understood. This sense is not apparent in the sense of the letter, for it is within it like the soul in the body. It is known that there is a Spiritual and a Natural, and that what is spiritual inflows into what is natural and presents itself to be seen and felt in forms that become objects of sight and touch, and that the Spiritual apart from those forms is not perceived otherwise than as affection and thought, or as love and wisdom, which are of the mind. It is acknowledged that affection and thought, or love to which affection pertains, and wisdom to which thinking pertains, are spiritual. The fact is known that these two faculties of the soul present themselves in the body in forms that are called sensory and motor organs; as also is the fact that they [the soul's faculties and organs] make one, and one in such a way that, while the mind thinks, the mouth instantly utters what is being thought, and while the mind wills, the body instantly does what is being willed. From this it is clear that with man there is a perfect union of things spiritual and natural.</p><p>[2] It is similar in all the things of the world and in each separate thing thereof. What is spiritual is there, being the inmost of the cause, and what is natural is there, being the effect of that; and the two make one. In the Natural also the Spiritual is not apparent, because, as has been said, this is within it as the soul in the body, and as the inmost of the cause in the effect. It is similar with the Word. Since this is Divine, it is not possible for anyone to deny that in its bosom it is spiritual. Since, however, what is spiritual is not apparent in the sense of the letter, which is natural, the spiritual sense was unknown up to this time; and it could not have become known before, until genuine truths were revealed by the Lord, for that sense is in these truths. This is why the Apocalypse has not been understood up to this time. But so that there may be no doubt that such things are therein, the details must be expounded and demonstrated by means of similar things elsewhere in the Word. The exposition and demonstration now follows.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The words 'over Him,' omitted here, are not referred to at <a href="27.htm">27</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;Reading et (also) instead of est (is).<br><br>3.&nbsp;Omitted here in the Original Edition.

"And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead," signifies the failing of his own life from such presence of the Lord, (<a href="54.htm">54</a>). "And He laid His right hand upon me," signifies life then inspired from Him, (<a href="55.htm">55</a>). "Saying unto me, Fear not," signifies resuscitation, and adoration then from the deepest humiliation, (<a href="56.htm">56</a>). "I am the First and the Last," signifies that He is Eternal and Infinite, and thus the Only God, (<a href="57.htm">57</a>).<p>Verse 18. "And am He that is living," signifies who alone is life, and from whom alone life is, (<a href="58.htm">58</a>). "And was dead," signifies that He was neglected in the church, and His Divine Human not acknowledged, (<a href="59.htm">59</a>).

"The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands," signifies arcana in the visions concerning the New Heaven and the New Church, (<a href="64.htm">64</a>). "The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches," signifies the New Church in the heavens, which is the New Heaven, (<a href="65.htm">65</a>). "And the seven lampstands which thou sawest are the seven churches," signifies the New Church on earth, which is the New Jerusalem descending from the Lord out of the New Heaven.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the original Latin "of the kings" is omitted.<br><br>2.&nbsp;The clause in brackets is omitted in the Latin, but appears in the explanation below, (<a href="39.htm">39</a>).<p>3.&nbsp;In the original Latin "white" is omitted, but is in the text of the chapter.<br><br>THE EXPLANATION<br><br>What the spiritual sense is, has been hitherto unknown. That there is such a sense in every particular of the Word, and that without it, the Word in many places cannot be understood, has been shown in t he Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture. (<a href="../ss/5.htm">Doctrine of Sacred Scripture 5-26</a>). This sense does not appear in the literal sense, for it is in it as the soul in its body. It is known that there is the spiritual and the natural, and that the spiritual flows into the natural, and presents itself to be seen and felt in the forms which fall under the sight and touch, and that the spiritual, without such forms, is not perceived otherwise than as affection and thought, or as love and wisdom which are of the mind. That affection and thought, or love whose property it is to be affected, and wisdom whose property it is to think, are spiritual, is acknowledged. That these two faculties of the soul present themselves in the body in forms which are called the organs of sense and motion, is known; also, that they make one, and such a one as that when the mind thinks, the mouth in an instant speaks, and when the mind wills, the body in an instant acts; hence it is evident, that there is a perfect union of things spiritual and natural with man.</p><p><p>[2] It is similar in each and everything in the world; there is in them the spiritual, which is the inmost of the cause, and there is the natural, which is its effect, and these two make one; and the spiritual does not appear in the natural, because it is in it as the soul in the body, and as the inmost of the cause in the effect, as was said before. It is similar with the Word; that this in its bosom is spiritual, because it is Divine, can be denied by no one; but as the spiritual does not appear in the sense of the letter, which is natural, therefore the spiritual sense has been hitherto unknown; nor could it have been known before genuine truths were revealed by the Lord, for that sense is in these. For this reason Revelation has not been understood before. But lest there should be doubt that such things are within it, the particulars must be explained, and demonstrated by similar passages elsewhere in the Word. The explanation and demonstration now follow. </p>

"Mysterium septem stellarum quas vidisti in dextra Mea, et septem candelabra aurea," significat arcana in visionibus de novo Caelo, et de nova Ecclesia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_1/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_64" target=_top>64</a>); "septem stellae Angeli septem Ecclesiarum sunt," significat novam Ecclesiam in Caelis, quae est novum Caelum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_1/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_65" target=_top>65</a>); "et septem candelabra quae vidisti, septem Ecclesiae sunt," significat novam Ecclesiam in terris, quae est nova Hierosolyma, descendens a Domino e novo Caelo (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_1/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_66" target=_top>66</a>).<p>EXPLICATIO. <p>QUID Sensus Spiritualis, hactenus ignotum fuit; quod ille sit in singulis Verbi, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_1/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_5" target=_top>Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 5-26</a>, ostensum est, et quod Verbum absque illo in multis locis non possit intelligi: ille Sensus non apparet in sensu literae, inest enim ei Sicut anima corpori. Notum est, quod Sit Spirituale et Naturale, et quod Spirituale influat in Naturale, et se sistat videndum et sentiendum in formis quae cadunt in visum et tactum, et quod Spirituale absque illis non percipiatur aliter quam sicut Affectio et Cogitatio, aut sicut Amor et Sapientia, quae sunt mentis; quod Affectio et Cogitatio, seu Amor cujus est affici, et Sapientia cujus est cogitare, sint spirituales, agnoscitur; quod illae binae animae facultates se sistant in formis in corpore, quae vocantur organa sensoria et motoria, notum est; tum etiam quod unum faciant, ac ita unum, ut dum mens cogitat, id os in instanti eloquatur, et dum mens vult, id corpus in instanti agat; inde patet, quod sit perfecta unio spiritualium et naturalium apud hominem. Simile est in omnibus et singulis mundi; est ibi spirituale quod est intimum causae, et est naturale quod est ejus effectus, et illa duo unum faciunt; et in naturali non apparet spirituale, quia hoc illi inest sicut anima corpori, ac sicut intimum causae effectui, ut dictum est. Simile est cum Verbo; quod hoc sit spirituale in suo sinu, quia est Divinum, a nemine negari potest; sed quia spirituale non apparet in sensu literae, qui est naturalis, ideo Sensus Spiritualis hactenus ignotus fuit; nec potuit notus fieri prius quam dum genuina vera a Domino revelata sunt, nam in his est ille sensus. Inde est, quod Apocalypsis hactenus non intellecta fuerit. Verum ne dubium sit quin talia insint, explicanda sunt singula, et demonstranda per similia alibi in Verbo. Explicatio et demonstratio nunc sequitur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;et pro "est"<p>2.&nbsp;Verba in uncis inclusa videantur infra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_1/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_39" target=_top>39</a>).<p>3.&nbsp;loquebatur pro "loquetur" </p>
