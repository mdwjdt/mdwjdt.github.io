<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第686节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>686.“今在昔在神圣的主阿，你是公义的，因为你已经判断这些事”表这是出于主的圣治，主无论现在还是过去都是圣言，也是神性真理本身，否则，神性真理会遭到亵渎。“主阿，你是公义的，因为你已经判断这些事”表示这是出于主的圣治，这一点很快就会看到。“今在昔在的”表示主的圣言，照约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）所说，主无论现在还是过去，都是圣言或道（Word）。主在此之所以是指圣言，是因为现在论述的是那些属于教会的人对圣言的理解。至于当论及主时，“今在和昔在”、“初和终”、“首先的和末后的”、“阿拉法和俄梅戛”进一步表示什么，可参看前文（<a href="13.htm">13</a>，<a href="29.htm">29</a>-<a href="31.htm">31</a>，<a href="38.htm">38</a>，<a href="57.htm">57</a>节）。“神圣”表示祂是神性真理本身（<a href="173.htm">173</a>，<a href="586.htm">586</a>，<a href="666.htm">666</a>节）。从这些事明显可知，“今在昔在神圣的主阿，你是公义的，因为你已经判断这些事”表这是出于主的圣治，主无论现在还是过去都是圣言，也是神性真理本身。</p><p>按照主的圣治，那些陷入唯信的人会歪曲圣言的真理，这是因为他们若知道这些真理，以至于进行深入的思考，就会亵渎它们；事实上，他们陷入邪恶，因为他们没有避恶如罪，也没有直接靠近主。所以，他们若真的接受圣言的纯正真理，就会将它们与其生活的邪恶混在一起；由此导致的后果就是对神圣事物的亵渎。因此，其中一条许可法（the laws of permission），也就是圣治的律法规定，他们可以凭自己歪曲真理，歪曲的程度视他们陷入生活的邪恶程度而定。按照圣治，那些陷入生活邪恶的人必陷入教义的虚假，免得圣言的神性真理遭到亵渎，这一点可见于《圣治》（<a href="../dp/221.htm">221</a>-233节，<a href="../dp/257.htm">257</a>节末尾）一书。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 686</h4><p>686. "You are righteous, O Lord, the One who is and who was, and holy, because You have judged these things." This symbolically means that this judgment is of the Divine providence of the Lord, who is and was the Word, and Divine truth itself, which otherwise would be profaned.<p>"You are righteous, O Lord, because you have judged these things," means symbolically that this is of the Lord's Divine providence, as will be seen below. "Who is and who was" symbolically means the Lord in relation to the Word, as embodying and having embodied the Word, in accordance with <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>. <sup>1</sup>The Lord as an embodiment of the Word is meant here because the subject is the understanding of the Word in people who are of the church. More on the symbolic meanings of is and was, beginning and end, first and last, alpha and omega, when referring to the Lord, may be seen in nos. <a href="13.htm">13</a>, <a href="29.htm">29</a>, <a href="30.htm">30</a>, <a href="31.htm">31</a>, <a href="38.htm">38</a>, <a href="57.htm">57</a> above. And that He is holy means symbolically that He is Divine truth itself (nos. <a href="173.htm">173</a>, <a href="586.htm">586</a>, <a href="666.htm">666</a>).<p>It is apparent from this that "You are righteous, O Lord, the One who is and who was, and holy, because You have judged these things," symbolically means that this is of the Divine providence of the Lord, who is and was the Word, and Divine truth itself.</p><p>[2] It is of the Lord's Divine providence that people caught up in faith alone falsify the Word's truths, because if they were to know them, to the point of thinking deeply about them, they would profane them. For they are caught up in evils, because they do not refrain from evils as being sinful, nor do they turn directly to the Lord. Consequently, if they were to accept the genuine truths in the Word, they would commingle them with their evil practices, and this would give rise to a profanation of what is holy.<p>One of the laws of permission, therefore, which are also laws of Divine providence, is that people like this of themselves falsify truths, and this to the extent that they are caught up in evil practices.<p>It is a matter of Divine providence that people caught up in evil practices cannot but be caught up in falsities as to doctrine, in order to keep them from profaning the Word's Divine truths. See Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Providence, nos. <a href="../dp/221.htm">221-233</a> and no. <a href="../dp/257.htm">257</a> at the end.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God... And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 686</h4><p>686. 'Thou art just, O Lord, Who Is and Who Was, and art Holy, because Thou hast judged these things' signifies that this is of the Divine Providence of the Lord, Who is and Who was the Word, and the Divine Truth Itself, which otherwise would be profaned. 'Thou art just, O Lord, because Thou hast judged these things' signifies that this is of the Lord's Divine Providence, concerning which [something] follows. 'Who Is and Who Was' signifies the Lord as to the Word, that He is and that He was the Word, according to. <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>. The reason that here is understood the Lord as to the Word is because it treats of the understanding of the Word with those who belong to the Church. The many things that are signified by 'Is and Was,' 'the Beginning and the Ending,' 'the First and the Last,' 'Alpha and Omega,' where said of the Lord, maybe seen above (<a href="13.htm">13</a>, <a href="29.htm">29-31</a>, <a href="38.htm">38</a>, <a href="57.htm">57</a>). By His being 'Holy' is signified that He is Divine Truth Itself (<a href="173.htm">173</a>, <a href="586.htm">586</a>, <a href="666.htm">666</a>). From these things it is plain that by 'Thou art just, O Lord, Who Is and Who Was, and art Holy, because Thou hast judged these things' is signified that this is of the Divine Providence of the Lord, Who Is and Was the Word and Divine Truth Itself.</p><p>[2] The reason why it is of the Lord's Divine Providence that those who are in faith alone falsify the truths of the Word, is because if they were to know them as far as to think interiorly of them, they would profane them. For they are in evils, because they do not flee from evils as sins, nor do they approach the Lord directly; and therefore if they were to receive the genuine truths of the Word, they would mix them together with the evils of their own life, which would give rise to the profanation of what is holy. Therefore it is among the laws of permission, which are also laws of Divine Providence, that they should of themselves falsify truths, and this to the same extent as they are in evils of life. That there is a Divine Providence so that those who are in evils of life cannot but be in untruths of doctrine lest the Divine Truths of the Word should be profaned, may be seen in <a href="../dp/221.htm">ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE PROVIDENCE 221-233</a>, <a href="../dp/257.htm">257</a> at the end. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 686</h4><p>686. Thou art just, O Lord, Who art, and Who wast, and art holy, because Thou hast judged these things, signifies that this is of the Divine Providence of the Lord, Who is and Who was the Word, and the Divine truth itself, which otherwise would be profaned. "Thou art just, O Lord, because thou hast judged these things," signifies that this is of the Lord's Divine Providence, as will be seen presently. "Who art, and Who wast," signifies the Lord as to the Word, that He is and was the Word, according to <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>. The reason why the Lord is here meant by the Word, is, because it now treats of the understanding of the Word with those who are of the church. What is further signified by "Is and Was," "the Beginning and the End," "the First and the Last," "the Alpha and the Omega," when applied to the Lord, may be seen above, (<a href="13.htm">13</a>, <a href="29.htm">29-31</a>, <a href="38.htm">38</a>, <a href="57.htm">57</a>). By "holy" is signified that He is the Divine truth itself, (<a href="173.htm">173</a>, <a href="586.htm">586</a>, <a href="666.htm">666</a>). From these things it is evident that by "Thou art just, O Lord, Who art, and Who wast, and art holy, because Thou hast judged these things," is signified that this is of the Divine Providence of the Lord, Who is and was the Word and Divine truth itself.</p><p>[2] The reason why it is of the Lord's Divine Providence that they who are in faith alone should falsify the truths of the Word, is because if they knew them, so as to think of them interiorly, they would profane them; for they are in evils, because they do not shun evils as sins, nor approach the Lord immediately. Wherefore if they were to receive the genuine truths of the Word, they would mix them with the evils of their life; and the result of this would be the profanation of what is holy. It is therefore one of the laws of permission, which are also laws of the Divine Providence, that they should from themselves falsify truths, and this in proportion as they are in evils of life. That it is of the Divine Providence, that they who are in evils of life should never be otherwise than in falsities of doctrine, lest the Divine truths of the Word should be profaned, may be seen in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Providence, (<a href="221.htm">221-233</a>, and 257). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 686 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>686. "Justus es Domine, Qui Est et Qui Fuit; at Sanctus, quia haec judicasti," significat quod hoc sit ex Divina Providentia Domini, Qui est et Qui fuit Verbum, ac Ipsum Divinum Verum, quod alioquin prophanaretur.- "Justus es Domine, quia haec judicasti," significat quod hoc ex Divina Domini Providentia sit, de qua sequitur; "Qui Est et Qui Fuit" significat Dominum quoad Verbum, quod sit et quod fuerit Verbum (secundum <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_686/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_1-2" target=_top>Johannes 1:1-2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_686/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_14" target=_top>14</a>). Quod Dominus hic ut Verbum intelligatur, est quia de intellectu Verbi apud illos, qui ab Ecclesia sunt, agitur; plura quae significantur per "Est et Fuit," "Principium et Finem," "Primum et Ultimum," "Alpham et Omegam," ubi de Domino, videantur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_686/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_13" target=_top>13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_686/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_29" target=_top>29</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_686/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_30" target=_top>30</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_686/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_31" target=_top>31</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_686/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_38" target=_top>38</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_686/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_57" target=_top>57</a>); per quod "Sanctus" significatur quod sit Ipsum Divinum Verum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_686/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173" target=_top>173</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_686/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_586" target=_top>586</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_686/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_666" target=_top>666</a>). Ex his patet quod per "justus es Domine, Qui Est et Qui Fuit, et Sanctus, quia haec judicasti," significetur quod hoc sit ex Divina Providentia Domini, Qui Est et Fuit Verbum et Ipsum Divinum Verum. Quod ex Divina Providentia Domini sit, quod illi qui in sola Fide sunt falsificent vera Verbi, est quia si scirent illa, usque ut interius cogitarent illa, prophanarent illa; sunt enim in malis, quia non fugiunt mala ut peccata, nec immediate adeunt Dominum; quare si genuina vera Verbi reciperent, commiscerent illa malis vitae suae; unde oriretur prophanatio sancti: ideo inter leges Permissionis, quae etiam sunt leges Divinae Providentiae, est, ut illi ex se falsificent vera, ac in tantum, quantum in malis vitae sunt. Quod Divina Providentia sit, ut qui in malis vitae sunt, non sint nisi quam in falsis doctrinae, ob causam ne prophanentur Divina Vera Verbi, videatur in Sapientia Angelica de <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_686/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_221" target=_top>Divina Providentia 221-233</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_686/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_257" target=_top>257</a>. </p>
