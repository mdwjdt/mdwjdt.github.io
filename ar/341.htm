<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>341. 对此，我补充以下记事：</p><p>我看见一些英国牧师聚集起来，人数有六百之多。他们正向主祷告，好让他们上到高层天堂的社群里去，并得蒙允许，于是便上去了。他们一进去，就看到他们的国王，就是当今执政国王的祖父*，很是欢喜。这位国王走到他们当中的两位主教跟前，他在世时就认识他们，并与他们交谈，问他们说：“你们是怎么到这里来的？”他们回答说，他们向主祈求，得到恩准。王便对他们说：“你们为何向主，而不是向父神祈求？”他们说，他们在下面就是如此被教导的。于是，王说：“在世时我不是多次告诉你们，当靠近主，还告诉你们仁爱是首要的吗？那么，关于主，你们是怎么回答的呢？”他们被准予忆起，他们当时的回答是：当靠近父时，也就靠近了子。但国王周围的天使说：“你弄错了，不是你想的那样。并不靠近父神时就靠近了主，而是靠近主时便靠近了父神，因为他们为一，如同灵魂与身体为一。谁靠近了一个人的灵魂，便以这种方式靠近他的身体了呢？当一个人靠近他所看见的身体时，他所看不见的灵魂不也被靠近了吗？”听完这番话，他们沉默不语。国王上前来到两位主教跟前，手里拿着两份礼物，说：“这些礼物是天堂的。”这礼物是黄金打造的天堂雕塑，国王想赠给他们。但就在这时，一片乌云遮蔽他们，并将他们分开，这些牧师又从来时的路降了下去。他们把这些事写在一本书里。</p><p>其余的英国牧师听说他们的同伴被恩准上到高层天堂，就聚集在山脚下，等他们回来。这六百人回来后，便问候他们的兄弟，告诉他们在天堂的经历，说起国王给主教的两个黄金天堂雕塑，看去上精美绝伦，却从他们手中掉落了。然后，他们从公共场所出来，离开进入附近的一片林子，一边互相交谈，一边环顾四周，看看是否有人听见，尽管如此，他们的话还是被听到了。他们先是谈论和谐与一致，然后又论述首要和掌权。主教们在发言，其余的人则随声附和。突然间，我惊讶地发现，他们不再显为许多人，而是显为一个巨人，脸面像狮子，头上有高耸的主教冠，顶上有冠冕。他高谈阔论，大步流星，回头一看，说：“除了我，谁还有至高无上的权利？”国王从天往下一看，只见所有人先是如同一人，然后又如同一致的多人；但如他所说，他们绝大多数都穿着世俗的衣服。</p><p>附注：这本书写于乔治三世（1760-1820）统治时期，他是乔治二世的孙子。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 341</h4><p>341. To this I will append the following account:<p>I saw some English clergymen assembled - as many as six hundred - who were praying to the Lord to allow them to ascend into one of the societies of a higher heaven, and it was granted them. So they ascended, and upon entering it, they saw their king, the grandfather of the king presently reigning, <sup>1</sup>and they rejoiced. The king then came over to two bishops that they had among them, whom he had known in the world, and speaking to them, he asked, "How came you here?"<p>They replied that they had petitioned the Lord, and that it had been granted.<p>The king said to them, "Why did you petition the Lord, and not God the Father?"<p>And the bishops said that it was what they had been told to do below.<p>Then the king said, "Did I not tell you this at times in the world, that one must go to the Lord, and furthermore, that charity is the primary thing. What was your answer in regard to the Lord then?"<p>It was then given them to remember that they had replied that when one goes to the Father, one goes also to the Son.<p>But the angels surrounding the king said, "You are mistaken. That's not what you thought, nor does one go to the Lord when one goes to God the Father. Rather, one goes to God the Father when one goes to the Lord, because they are one, like soul and body. Who approaches someone's soul and in that way his body? Is it not the case that when one approaches a person's body, something that he sees, he approaches also the person's soul, which he does not see?"<p>To this the bishops made no answer. And the king drew near to the two bishops, holding in his hand two gifts, saying, "These are gifts from heaven."<p>The gifts were heavenly figurines of gold, and the king tried to hand them over. But suddenly then a dusky cloud covered them and separated them, and the clergymen descended the way they had come. They then recorded this event in a book.</p><p>[2] All the other English clergymen who heard that their colleagues had been granted to ascend to a higher heaven, assembled at the foot of a mountain, where they awaited their return. And when those colleagues did return, they greeted their brethren and related what had befallen them in heaven, saying that the king had given the bishops two heavenly figurines of gold most beautiful to look at, but that these had fallen out of their hands. And then they disappeared into a nearby wood and conferred with each other, looking around to see if anyone was overhearing. But they were overheard nevertheless.<p>They were talking about unanimity and harmony, and then about primacy and dominion. The bishops did the speaking, and the rest favored them with their assent. But suddenly, to my surprise, they no longer appeared as many, but as one great person, with a face like that of a lion, having on his head a towering miter, and upon that a crown. And he spoke with a deep voice, and went forward with a broad step. And looking behind him he said, "Who else has a right to primacy but me?"<p>The king looked down from heaven and saw - seeing them all first as one, and then as many in harmony, most in secular clothing, he said.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The English king presently reigning was George III (1760-1820), grandson of George II (1727-1760). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 341</h4><p>341. To these things I will add this MEMORABLE OCCURRENCE. I saw as many as six hundred of the English clergy assembled, who were praying to the Lord to allow them to go up into a society of the higher heaven; and this was granted, and they went up. And when they entered they saw their king, the grandfather <sup>1</sup>of the king reigning at the present day, and they rejoiced. He then went to two bishops who were among them, whom he had known in the world, and speaking with them asked, 'How did you come here?' They answered that they had made supplication to the Lord, and it was granted. He said to them, 'Why to the Lord, and not to God the Father?,' and they said that they were so instructed below. And he said, 'Did I not say several times to you in the world that the Lord ought to be approached, and also that charity is primary? What did you then answer concerning the Lord?' And it was given them to remember that they had answered that when the Father is approached the Son also is approached. But the angels who were around the king said, 'You are mistaken. You did not think that; nor is the Lord approached when God the Father is approached, but God the Father is approached when the Lord is approached, because they are one as are soul and body. Who approaches a man's soul, and in that way his body? When a man is approached as to the body that he sees, is not his soul that he does not see approached also?' At these things they became silent. And the king went up to the two bishops, holding in his hand two gifts, saying, 'These gifts are of heaven.' They were heavenly figures of gold, and he wanted to make a presentation. But just then a dark cloud covered them over and separated them, and they descended the way they had come up. And they wrote these things in a book.</p><p>[2] The rest of the English clergy, having heard that their colleagues were permitted to go up into the higher heaven, assembled at the foot of a mountain where they were awaiting their return. And when they [the six hundred] returned they were greeting their brethren and telling them about what happened to them in the heaven, and that the two heavenly figures of gold, most beautiful to behold, had been given to the bishops by the king, but that they fell out of their hands. And then they went away out of the open space into a wood that was nearby, and were speaking among themselves, looking around to see if anyone might hear them, but [what they said] was heard nevertheless. They were speaking about unanimity and concord, and then about the primacy and dominion. The bishops were speaking, and the rest were disposed to agree. And suddenly, to my surprise, they were no longer appearing as many, but as one great man, whose face was like the face of a lion, having on his head a towering mitre with a crown on top, and he was speaking in a lofty tone, and taking long paces. And looking backwards, he said, 'Who else but me has a right to the primacy?' The king looked down out of the heaven and first saw all of them as one, and then as many of one accord, most of them being in secular garb, as he said.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This would be George II, the grandfather of George III. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 341</h4><p>341. To the above I will add this Relation. I saw some of the English clergy assembled, to the number of six hundred, who prayed to the Lord that they might be permitted to ascend to a society of the higher heaven; which being granted them, they ascended. And when they entered, they saw their king, the present king's grandfather, <sup>1</sup>and they were glad, who went up to two bishops that were among them, whom he had known in the world, and entering into discourse with them, asked them, "How came you here?" They replied, that they had made supplication to the Lord, and it was granted them. He said to them, "Why to the Lord, and not to God the Father?" And they answered, that they were so instructed below. And he said, "Did I not sometimes tell you in the world, that the Lord ought to be approached, and also that charity is primary? What reply did you then make concerning the Lord?" And it was given them to recollect, that they had made answer, "That when the Father is approached, the Son also is approached." But the angels who were about the king said, "You are mistaken, you did not think so, nor is the Lord approached, when God the Father is approached; but God the Father is approached, when approach is made to the Lord, because they are one, like soul and body. Who approaches a man's soul, and thus his body? When a man is approached as to his body, which is seen, is not his soul also approached, which is not seen?" To this they were silent. And the king went up to the two bishops, with two gifts in his hand, saying, "These are gifts from heaven." They were celestial forms of gold which he wished to present to them, when a dusky cloud covered them, and separated them. And they descended by the way that they had come up; and they wrote these things in a book.</p><p>[2] The rest of the English clergy, who had heard that their companions had been permitted to ascend to the higher heaven, assembled at the foot of the mountain, where they waited for their return. On their return they saluted their brethren, and related what had happened to them in heaven, and that the king had presented the bishops with two celestial forms of gold, most beautiful to behold; but that they fell out of their hands. They then went out of the public place into a grove, which was near, and discoursed among themselves, looking about to see if anyone heard them; but nevertheless they were heard. Their discourse was about unanimity and concord, and then about supremacy and dominion. The bishops spoke, and the rest assented. And on a sudden, to my surprise, they no longer appeared as many, but as one great figure whose face was like the face of a lion, having on his head a turreted miter, on which was a crown: and he spoke in a lofty tone, and walked proudly; and, looking behind, he said, "Who else has a right to supremacy but me?" The king looked down from heaven and saw them, first all as one, and afterwards as several unanimous; but most of them, as he said, in a secular dress.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This was written in the reign of George III. , who was grandson to George II. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 341 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>341. His adjiciam hoc MEMORABILE: - <p>Vidi ex Clero Angliae congregatos usque ad sexcentos, qui orabant ad Dominum, ut liceret illis ascendere in unam Societatem superioris Caeli; et datum est, et ascenderunt. <p>Et cum ingressi sunt, viderunt Regem eorum, Avum Regis hodie regnantis, et laetati sunt; qui tunc accessit ad binos Episcopos, qui inter illos erant, quos cognoverat in mundo, et loquens cum illis interrogavit, "Quomodo venistis huc." <p>Responderunt, quod supplicaverint ad Dominum, et datum est. <p>Dixit illis, "Cur ad Dominum, et non ad Deum Patrem." <p>Et dixerunt quod sic instructi sint infra. <p>Et dixit, "Annon hoc vobis aliquoties dixi in mundo, quod Dominus adeundus sit, tum etiam quod charitas sit primarium; quid tunc de Domino respondistis." <p>Et datum est illis recordari, quod responderint quod cum Pater aditur etiam Filius adeatur. <p>Sed dixerunt Angeli qui circum Regem erant, "Erratis, non id cogitavistis, nec aditur Dominus cum aditur Deus Pater, sed aditur Deus Pater cum aditur Dominus, quia unum sunt sicut anima et corpus. Quis adit animam hominis et sic corpus ejus; annon cum aditur homo quoad corpus quod videt, etiam aditur anima ejus quam non videt." Ad haec conticuerunt. <p>Et accessit Rex ad duos Episcopos, tenens in manu duo dona, dicens, "Haec dona Caeli sunt." Erant formae caelestes ex auro; et voluit porrigere, sed tunc nubes fusca obtexit illos, et separavit illos. <p>Et descenderunt via qua ascenderunt; et scripserunt haec in libro. <p>Reliqui ex Clero Angliae, qui audiverunt quod Consociis suis datum sit ascendere in superius Caelum, congregati sunt ad pedes montis, ubi exspectabant reditum - eorum; et cum redierunt, salutabant fratres suos, et enarrabant quid illis in Caelo evenit, et quod a Rege datae fuerunt Episcopis duae formae caelestes ex auro aspectu pulcherrimae, sed quod e manibus eorum exciderint. <p>Et tunc e propatulo abibant in nemus quod prope erat, et loquebantur inter se, circumspicientes num quisquam audiret, sed audiebatur usque. Loquebantur de unanimitate et concordia, et tunc de principatu et dominio: Episcopi loquebantur, et reliqui assensu favebant. <p>Et subito, quod miratus sum, non apparebant amplius ut multi, sed ut unus magnus, cujus facies similis faciei leonis, habentis super capite tiaram turritam super qua corona, et loquebatur tono alto, et progrediebatur passu lato, et retrospiciens dixit, "Cui alii, ex jure, principatus quam mihi." <p>Rex e Caelo despexit, et vidit primum omnes ut unum, et deinde ut plures unanimos, plerosque in veste saeculari, quod dixit. </p>
