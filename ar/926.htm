<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第926节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>926.对此，我补充以下记事：</p><p>我在解释第二十章经文，沉思那龙、兽和假先知时，有一个人出现在我面前，问道：“你在想什么？”我说在想假先知。然后他说：“我带你去个地方，‘假先知’所指的那些人就在那里。”他说，他们和启示录十三章中“另有一个兽从地中上来。他有两角如同羊羔，说话好像龙”所指的那些人一模一样。我跟着他，看哪，只见有一大群人，当中是领袖，他们教导说，除了信以外，没有什么东西能拯救人；行为是好的，却无助于救恩；然而还是应当通过圣言接受教导，好叫平信徒，尤其简单人能更规矩地服从地方官，并且如同通过宗教那样进而从内在被迫使去实践道德的仁爱。</p><p>这时，其中一个人看到我说：“你想见识一下我们的神殿吗？那里面有代表我们信仰的雕像。”我走近一瞧，只见那神殿颇为壮观，中间有一个妇人的雕像，身穿朱红色衣裳，右手拿着一枚金币，左手拿着一串珍珠。不过，这神殿和雕像都是幻觉造成的；因为地狱灵能以幻觉通过关闭心智内层，只打开心智外层来表现壮观的场景。我意识到它们就是这种幻觉，便向主祷告，于是我的心智内层突然被打开了。然后，壮观的神殿不见了，取而代之的是从屋顶到屋底满是裂缝的一所房子，里面什么都没有。那妇人也不见了，我看到那房子里游荡着一个幽灵，它的头像龙头，身体像豹的身体，脚像熊的脚，恰如启示录（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.2.htm">13:2</a>）所描述的“从海中上来的兽”。取代地板的则是遍满青蛙的沼泽。有人对我说，沼泽下面有一块凿过的大石头，圣言就深藏在它下面。</p><p>看到这些景象，我对这巫师说：“这就是你们的神殿？”他说是的。突然，他的内视也被打开了，于是他便看到了我所看到的这些东西；一看到它们，他就大叫道：“这是什么？从哪来的？”我说，这是由于天堂之光，这光能揭开一切形式的性质，在此揭开的是你们那脱离属灵仁爱的信仰的性质。立时有东风刮来，将那里的一切都吹走了，也吹干了沼泽，从而露出下面放有圣言的巨石。之后，似乎从天上吹来春天之热；只见这个地方出现一座帐篷，外形很简朴。与我同在的天使说：“看哪，亚伯拉罕的帐篷，就是三位天使到他那里，并宣告以撒要出生时的那种。这个帐篷看上去很简单，但随着天堂之光的流入，它会变得越来越壮观。”他们获准打开处于智慧的属灵天使所在的天堂；然后光从这天堂一照进来，那帐篷看上去就像一座圣殿，类似于耶路撒冷圣殿。我往里观看，只见下面放有圣言的基石四周镶满宝石；仿佛有光芒从这些宝石投射到墙上，墙上饰有基路伯的形像，这美丽的光芒用各种颜色把它们装饰得五彩斑斓。</p><p>当我对此赞赏不已时，天使说：“你会看到更奇妙的景象。”他们被允许打开第三层天堂，处于爱的属天天使就其中。这时，凭着由此所流入的光，整座圣殿消失了，取而代之的是独有主站在那基石，也就是圣言之上，形像和约翰（启示录1章）所见到的一样。当时，神圣感充满天使的心智内层，促使他们俯伏在地；突然，主关闭了出于第三天堂的光之通道，并打开了出于第二层天堂的光之通道，结果，圣殿和帐篷恢复原样，不过，帐篷却在圣殿里。这些景象描绘了本章这些话所表示的：</p><p>看哪！神的帐幕在人间。祂要与人同住。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.3.htm">21:3</a>）</p><p>还有：</p><p>我未见新耶路撒冷内有殿，因主神全能者和羔羊为城的殿。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.22.htm">21:22</a>，｛918节）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 926</h4><p>926. To this I will append the following account:<p>When I was engaged in explaining chapter <a href="3927/revelation_20_1.htm">20</a> and thinking about the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet, someone appeared to me and asked, "What are you thinking about?"<p>I said, "About the false prophet."<p>Then he said, "I will take you down to the place where those people reside who are meant by the false prophet. They are," he said, "the same people as those meant in chapter <a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">13</a> by the beast from the earth, which had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon."<p>I followed him, and behold, I saw a crowd of people, and in their midst some priests who had taught that nothing else saves a person but faith, and that works are good, but not for salvation. Yet works, they said, must still be taught from the Word in order to keep the laity, especially the simple, more tightly in bonds of obedience toward their magistrates, and to compel them, as though by religion, thus from a deeper motive, to exercise a moral charity.</p><p>[2] One of the priests then, seeing me, said, "Would you like to see our chapel? We have an image representative of our faith there."<p>I went over and looked, and behold, it was magnificent. And at its center was the image of a woman, dressed in a scarlet garment, holding in her right hand a gold coin, and in her left a string of pearls. Both the chapel and the image, however, were produced by illusions. For spirits in hell can use illusions to represent magnificent things by closing the inner constituents of the mind and opening only its outer ones. But when I noticed that the spirits were such sorcerers, I prayed to the Lord, and suddenly the interiors of my mind were opened; and instead of a magnificent chapel I saw a building filled with cracks from the ceiling to the floor, with nothing in it holding together. And instead of the woman I saw in the building a statue hanging, with a head like that of a dragon, a body like that of a leopard, and feet like those of a bear, being thus like the description of the beast from the sea in the book of Revelation, chapter <a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">13</a>. Moreover, the floor was replaced by a swamp teeming with frogs. And I was told that beneath the swamp was a large hewn stone, under which lay the Word, well hidden.</p><p>[3] Seeing these changes, I said to the sorcerer, "Is this your chapel?" And he said it was.<p>But suddenly then his inner sight was opened too, and he saw the same changes I saw. And seeing them, he cried with a great cry, "What is this? And why did it happen?"<p>So I said that it was due to light from heaven, which exposes the true character of every form. "And in this case," I told them, "it is the character of your faith that is divorced from any spiritual charity."<p>Immediately then an eastern wind came and took everything there away; and it also dried up the swamp, and so laid bare the stone under which lay the Word. After that a spring-like warmth wafted over me from heaven, and behold, I saw in that same place a tent, simple in its outward form.<p>Then some angels who were with me said, "Behold, the tent of Abraham, as it was when the three angels came to him and announced the future birth of Isaac. It looks simple to the eye, but it becomes more and more magnificent in proportion to the influx of light from heaven."<p>It was given them then to open the heaven inhabited by spiritual angels, who are characterized by wisdom, and owing to the light flowing in from there the tent looked like a temple, like the one in Jerusalem. And when I looked inside, I saw a foundation stone beset with precious stones, under which the Word had been placed. From the precious stones flashed light like that of lightning on the walls, which had on them figures of cherubim, and it bathed them in beautifully variegated colors.</p><p>[4] While I was admiring these things, the angels said, "You will see something still more marvelous." And it was given them to open the third heaven, inhabited by celestial angels, who are characterized by love, and then, owing to the light flowing in from there, the temple completely vanished, and in its stead I saw the Lord alone, standing on the foundation stone, which was the Word, in an appearance like that in which John saw Him in chapter <a href="3927/revelation_1_1.htm">1</a> of the book of Revelation. But because a reverence then filled the interiors of the angels' minds, which produced in them an urge to fall prostrate upon their faces, suddenly the Lord closed the course of the light from the third heaven and opened the course of the light from the second heaven, and therefore the earlier appearance of a temple returned, and also that of the tent, but in the temple.<p>These experiences served to illustrate what is meant by the words in this chapter,<p>Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them (verse <a href="3927/revelation_21_3.htm">3</a>, no. <a href="882.htm">882</a>) <sup>1</sup><p>And by the words,<p>I saw no temple in (the New Jerusalem), for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple (verse <a href="3927/revelation_21_22.htm">22</a>, no. <a href="918.htm">918</a>). <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the original Latin, the word for tent and the word for tabernacle are the same. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 926</h4><p>926. To these things I will add this MEMORABLE OCCURRENCE.<p>While I was engaged on the exposition of the twentieth chapter, and was meditating on the dragon, the beast and the false prophet, a certain one appeared to me and asked 'What are you meditating on?' I said that it was about the false prophet. Then he said 'I will lead you to the place where those are who are understood by "the false prophet."' He said that they were the same as those who in chapter <a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">13</a> are understood by 'the beast out of the land, which had two horns like the lamb and spoke as the dragon.' I followed him, and behold, I saw a crowd in the midst of which were the leaders, who taught that nothing else saves a man but faith; and that works are good, but not for salvation; and that still they should be taught from the Word so that the laity, especially the simple, may be kept more closely in bonds of obedience to magistrates, and as from religion, thus interiorly, may be compelled to exercise moral charity.</p><p>[2] And then one of them seeing me said, 'Would you like to see our shrine in which there is the image representative of our faith?' I drew near and saw, and behold it was magnificent, and in the midst of it there was the image of a woman clothed with a scarlet garment, and holding in the right hand a gold coin and in the left a string of pearls. But both the shrine and the image had been brought about by means of phantasies; for infernal spirits are able by means of phantasies to represent magnificent things by closing up the interiors of the mind and opening only its exteriors. But when I became aware that they were such illusions I prayed to the Lord, and suddenly the interiors of my mind were opened, and then I saw instead of the magnificent shrine a house with cracks from the roof right down to the bottom, in which nothing held together. And instead of the woman I saw hovering in that house an apparition (simulachrum) of which the head was like a dragon's, the body like a leopard's, and the feet like those of a bear, just as 'the beast out of the sea' is described (Revelation xiii). And instead of the floor there was a swamp swarming with frogs. And it was said to me that beneath the swamp was a large hewn stone under which the Word was lying well hidden.</p><p>[3] Having seen these things, I said to the illusionist, 'Is this your shrine?' And he said that it was. But then suddenly interior sight was opened to him, and he saw the same things as I did. Having seen them he cried out with a great cry, 'What is this? Where has it come from?' And I said that it was by virtue of the light out of heaven, which discloses the quality of every form, and here [it has disclosed] the quality of your faith separated from spiritual charity. Whereupon there came an east wind and it carried away everything that was there, and it was also drying up the swamp and thus laying bare the stone under which the Word lay. And afterwards it breathed a spring-like warmth out of heaven, and then, behold, in the same place a tabernacle was seen, simple in its outward form; and the angels who were with me were saying, 'Behold the tabernacle of Abraham, what it was like when the three angels came to him and brought news of the forthcoming birth of Isaac. Before the eyes this appears simple, but in accordance with the influx of light out of heaven it becomes more and more magnificent.' And they were permitted to open the heaven in which were the spiritual angels who are in wisdom. And then by virtue of the light inflowing therefrom that tabernacle was appearing just like the Jerusalem temple. When I looked into it I saw the foundation stone under which the Word had been deposited. It was set around with precious stones from which as it were lightning flashed forth on to the walls, upon which were the forms of cherubs, and it beautifully variegated them with colours.</p><p>[4] When I had admired these things the angels said, 'You shall see things still more wonderful.' And they were permitted to open the third heaven, in which were the celestial angels who are in love. And then by virtue of the light inflowing therefrom the whole of that temple disappeared, and instead of it there was seen standing upon the foundation stone, which was the Word, the Lord Only in an appearance similar to that in which He was seen by John (Revelation i). But because the holiness then filled the interiors of the minds of the angels, with the result that they were impelled to fall prostrate on their faces, suddenly the passage of light out of the third heaven was closed by the Lord, and the passage of light out of the second heaven was opened, in consequence of which the former view of the temple came back, and also that of the tabernacle, but in the temple. By this was portrayed what is understood by these words in this chapter:<p>Behold God's tabernacle is with men, and He shall dwell with them (verse 3, <a href="882.htm">882</a>); and by these:<p>I saw no temple in the New Jerusalem, for the Lord God Almighty is the temple thereof and the Lamb (verse 22, <a href="918.htm">918</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 926</h4><p>926. To this I will add this Relation. When I was explaining the twentieth chapter, and was meditating about "the dragon," "the beast," and "the false prophet," a certain one appeared to me, and asked, "What are you meditating upon?" I said that it was upon the false prophet. He then said to me, "I will lead you to the place where they are who are meant by the false prophet." He said that they were the same as are meant (Revelation 13) by "the beast out of the earth, which had two horns like a lamb, and spoke as a dragon." I followed him, and behold, I saw a multitude, in the midst of which were leaders, who taught that nothing else saves man but faith; and that works are good, but not for salvation; and that still they are to be taught from the Word, that the laity, especially the simple, may be held the more strictly in the bonds of obedience to the magistrates, and as from religion, and thus interiorly, may be compelled to exercise moral charity.</p><p>[2] And then one of them, seeing me, said, "Do you wish to see our shrine, in which there is an image representative of our faith?" I drew near, and saw; and behold, it was magnificent, and in the midst of it an image of a woman, clothed in a scarlet garment, and holding a golden coin in the right hand; and in the left a chain of pearls. But both the shrine and the image were induced by fantasies; for infernal spirits can by fantasies represent magnificent things, by closing up the interiors of the mind, and opening only its exteriors. But when I noticed that they were such sorceries, I prayed to the Lord, and suddenly the interiors of my mind were opened; and I then saw in place of the magnificent shrine a house full of chinks, from the roof to the bottom, in which nothing cohered; and instead of a woman I saw hanging in that house an image, the head of which was like a dragon's, the body like a leopard's, and the feet like a bear's, thus like the description of the beast out of the sea (Revelation 13); and instead of the ground was a swamp, in which was a multitude of frogs; and it was said to me that under that swamp was a great hewn stone, beneath which lay the Word well concealed.</p><p>[3] On seeing these things, I said to the sorcerer, "Is this your shrine?" and he said that it was. But suddenly his interior sight was then opened, and he saw the same things that I did; on seeing which he cried out with a great cry, "What is this? and whence is this?" And I said that it is from the light of heaven, which discloses the quality of every form, and here the quality of your faith separated from spiritual charity. And immediately there came an east wind, and carried away everything that was there, and also dried up the swamp, and thus laid bare the stone, under which lay the Word. And after this there breathed as it were a vernal heat from heaven; and behold, there then appeared in the same place a tabernacle, simple in its external form. And the angels who were with me said, "Behold, the tabernacle of Abraham, such as it was when the three angels came to him, and announced that Isaac was to be born. This appears before the eyes as simple, but it becomes more and more magnificent according to the influx of light from heaven." And it was given them to open the heaven in which were the spiritual angels, who are in wisdom; and then, from the light flowing in thence, that tabernacle appeared like a temple similar to that at Jerusalem. When I looked into it, I saw the foundation stone, under which the Word had been deposited, set around with precious stones; from which as it were lightning flashed upon the walls, upon which were the forms of cherubim, and beautifully variegated them with colors.</p><p>[4] These things I wondered at. The angels said, "You shall see something still more wonderful." And it was given them to open the third heaven, in which were the celestial angels, who are in love; and then, from the light flowing in thence, the whole of that temple vanished; and in place of it was seen the Lord alone, standing upon the foundation stone, which was the Word, in appearance similar to that in which He was seen by John, (<a href="3927/revelation_1_13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a> But because a holiness then filled the interiors of the minds of the angels, by which there was an impulse to fall down upon their faces, suddenly the way of the light from the third heaven was closed by the Lord, and the way was opened for the light from the second heaven; in consequence of which the former appearance of the temple returned, and likewise of the tabernacle, but in the temple. By this was illustrated the meaning of these words in this chapter:<p>Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>; no. <a href="882.htm">882</a>);<p>and by these:<p>I saw no temple in the New Jerusalem; for the Lord God Almighty is the temple of it, and the Lamb, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_22.htm">Revelation 21:22</a>; no. <a href="918.htm">918</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 926 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>926. His adjiciam hoc MEMORABILE:- <p>Quando in Explicatione capitis vigesimi eram, et meditabar de "Dracone," "Bestia," et "Pseudopropheta," apparuit mihi quidam, et quaesivit, "Quid meditaris." Dixi, quod "de Pseudopropheta." <p>Tunc ille dixit, "Deducam te ad locum, ubi illi sunt qui per "Pseudoprophetam" intelliguntur." Dixit, quod iidem sint qui, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_926/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_13_1-18" target=_top>13</a>) intelliguntur per "Bestiam ex Terra, quae habebat duo cornua similia Agno, et locuta est sicut Draco." <p>Secutus sum illum, et ecce vidi turbam, in cujus medio erant antistites, qui docuerunt quod nihil aliud salvet hominem, quam Fides; et quod Opera sint bona, sed non ad salutem: et quod usque docenda sint ex Verbo, ut laici, imprimis simplices, strictius in vinculis obedientiae erga magistratus teneantur, ac sicut ex religione, ita interius, adigantur ad charitatem moralem exercendam. <p>Et tunc unus ex illis me videns dixit, "Vis videre nostrum Fanum, in quo est Imago repraesentativa nostrae Fidei." <p>Accessi et vidi; et ecce erat magnificum, et in medio ejus imago Mulieris, indutae veste coccinea, ac tenentis in dextra nummum aureum, et in sinistra catenam ex unionibus; sed erant et Fanum et Imago, inducta per phantasias: possunt enim spiritus infernales per phantasias repraesentare magnifica, occludendo interiora mentis, et aperiendo solum exteriora ejus. Sed cum animadverti quod tales praestigiae essent, oravi ad Dominum, et subito aperta sunt interiora mentis meae; et tunc vidi loco magnifici Fani domum rimosam a tecto usque ad imum, in qua nihil cohaesit, et vidi loco Mulieris in domo illa pendens simulacrum, cujus caput erat simile draconi, corpus sicut pardi, et pedes sicut ursi, ita sicut describitur" Bestia e Mari," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_926/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_13_1-18" target=_top>Apocalypsis 13</a>); et loco soli erat palus in qua multitudo ranarum; et dictum est mihi, quod sub palude esset Lapis magnus caesus, sub quo jaceret Verbum bene reconditum. <p>His visis, dixi ad Praestigiatorem, "Est hoc Vestrum Fanum;" et dixit, quod sit. <p>At subito tunc etiam aperiebatur illi visus interior, et vidit similia quae ego. Quibus visis clamavit clamore magno, "Quid hoc, et unde hoc." <p>Et dixi, quod sit e luce e Caelo, quae detegit quale cujusvis formae," et hic quale vestrae fidei separatae a charitate spirituali." <p>Et illico venit ventus orientalis, ac sustulit omne quod ibi erat, et quoque exsiccabat paludem, et sic nudabat Lapidem, sub quo jacuit Verbum. Et post haec spiravit calor sicut vernalis e Caelo, et ecce tunc in eodem loco visum est Tabernaculum quoad formam externam simplex. <p>Et dicebant angeli qui apud me erant, "Ecce Tabernaculum Abrahami, quale id fuit quando tres angeli ad illum venerunt et annuntiarunt de Isaco nascituro. Hoc apparet coram oculis simplex, sed usque fit secundum influxum lucis e Caelo magnificum plus et plus." <p>Et datum est illis aperire Caelum in quo angeli spirituales, qui in sapientia sunt, erant; et tunc ex luce inde influente, apparebat Tabernaculum illud, sicut Templum simile Hierosolymitano; quod cum introspexi, vidi Lapidem fundi, sub quo Verbum fuerat repositum, circum obsitum lapidibus pretiosis, e quibus sicut fulgur emicuit in parietes super quibus erant formae Cheruborum, et pulchre Variegavit illos coloribus. <p>Haec admiratus sum; (et) dixerunt angeli, "Videbis adhuc mirabilius." Et datum est illis aperire Caelum tertium, in quo angeli caelestes, qui in amore sunt, erant; et tunc ex luce inde influente, totum illud Templum evanuit, et loco ejus visus est Dominus Solus, stans super Lapide fundi, qui erat Verbum, in simili effigie in qua visus est Johanni, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_926/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_1_1-20" target=_top>Apocalypsis 1</a>); at quia sanctitas tunc implevit interiora mentis Angelorum, ex qua illis fuit nisus procidendi super facies, subito claudebatur a Domino via lucis e Caelo tertio, et aperiebatur via lucis e Caelo secundo, ex quo rediit aspectus prior Templi, et quoque Tabernaculi, sed in Templo. <p>Ex his illustratum est, quid intelligitur per haec in hoc capite: <p>"Ecce Tabernaculum Dei cum hominibus, et habitabit cum illis (vers. 3) (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_926/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_882" target=_top>882</a>);<p>et per haec: <p>"Templum non vidi" in Nova Hierosolyma, "quia Dominus Deus Omnipotens Templum ejus et Agnus (vers. 22) (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_926/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_918" target=_top>918</a>). </p>
