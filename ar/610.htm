<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第610节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>610.“他的数目是六百六十六”表这种性质，即圣言的一切真理都被他们歪曲了。“兽的数目”表示他们通过圣言对教义和信仰的确认的性质（<a href="608.htm">608</a>，<a href="609.htm">609</a>节）；“六百六十六”表示一切良善的真理，这个数字因论及圣言，故表示圣言中一切良善的真理，在此表示被歪曲了的真理，因为这是“兽的数目”。之所以是这种含义，是因为“六”与“三”乘“二”所表相同，“三”表示完全和全部之物，论及真理（<a href="505.htm">505</a>节），“二”表示真理与良善的婚姻；“六”因由这两个数字相乘构成，故表示圣言中一切良善的真理，在此表示被歪曲了的真理；从前面（<a href="566.htm">566</a>节）可以看出，他们也的确歪曲了它。经上之所以提到“六百六十六”这个数字，是因为这个数字中有三个六，三个意味着完全；而“六”乘一百得“六百”，乘十得“六十”并不改变什么（<a href="348.htm">348</a>节）。</p><p>“六”表示完全和全部之物，并用在论述良善的真理之处，这一点从圣言中出现这个数字的地方明显看出来；不过，该数字的含义只向那些以灵义看到所论述的事物之人显明，如，当主说：</p><p>落在好土里的种子结出果实，有三十倍的，有六十倍的，有一百倍的。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.8.htm">4:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.20.htm">20</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.8.htm">13:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.23.htm">23</a>）</p><p>有个家主约在午正（第三个时辰）和申初（第六个时辰）出去雇人进他的葡萄园。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.5.htm">3:5</a>）</p><p>在会幕中的桌子上把陈设饼摆成两行，每行六个。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利24.6.htm">24:6</a>）</p><p>照犹太人洁净的规矩，有六口石缸摆在那里。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.6.htm">2:6</a>）</p><p>有六座避难或庇护的逃城。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民35.6.htm">35:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民35.7.htm">7</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申19.1.htm">19:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申19.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>天使用来测量新殿和新城的量竿长六肘。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.5.htm">40:5</a>）</p><p>先知要按分量喝水，一天喝一欣的六分之一部分。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.11.htm">4:11</a>）</p><p>一贺梅珥大麦要献一伊法的六分之一部分。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.13.htm">45:13</a>）</p><p>由于“六”表示完全之物，故要取“六分之一部分”来用，这在灵义上表示完整和全部之物；如：</p><p>一贺梅珥大麦要献一伊法的六分之一。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.13.htm">45:13</a>）</p><p>经上论到歌革说：</p><p>我要使你转过来，遗弃你的六分之一部分。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.2.htm">39:2</a>）</p><p>以此表示对他来说，圣言中一切良善的真理被完全毁灭；他们由“歌革”来表示（参看<a href="859.htm">859</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 610</h4><p>610. And its number is 666. This symbolically means, their character being this, that by them all the Word's truth has been falsified.<p>The number of the beast symbolizes the character of the arguments the clergy use from the Word to defend their doctrine and faith (nos. <a href="608.htm">608</a>, <a href="609.htm">609</a>). Six hundred and sixty-six symbolizes every truth having to do with goodness, and because the statement is made in application to the Word, it symbolizes every truth in the Word having to do with goodness, in this case that truth falsified, because the number is the number of the beast.<p>This is the symbolic meaning because six has the same symbolism as three multiplied by two, and three symbolizes completeness and all and is predicated of truths (no. <a href="505.htm">505</a>), while two symbolizes the marriage of truth and good. So, because six is composed of these two numbers multiplied together, therefore it symbolizes every truth in the Word having to do with goodness, in this case that truth falsified. That it also was falsified by the clergy may be seen in no. <a href="566.htm">566</a> above.<p>The number is said to be 666, because it contains the number six repeated three times, and tripling it makes it complete. Multiplying six by one hundred to make six hundred, and by ten to make sixty, does not change the number's symbolic meaning, as may be seen in no. <a href="348.htm">348</a> above.</p><p>[2] That the number six symbolizes completeness and all, and is used when the subject is truths having to do with goodness, may be seen from passages in the Word where that number is mentioned. However, the symbolism of the number appears clearly only to people who see the things contained in the spiritual sense. As for instance, the Lord's saying that the seeds that fell on good ground yielded fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred (<a href="3927/mark_4_8.htm">Mark 4:8</a>, <a href="3927/mark_4_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_13_8.htm">Matthew 13:8</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_13_23.htm">23</a>); and that a landowner went out and hired laborers for his vineyard at the third hour and at the sixth hour (<a href="3927/matthew_20_3.htm">Matthew 20:3</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_20_5.htm">5</a>). Also that the table in the Tabernacle had on it cakes of showbread arranged in two rows, each containing six cakes (<a href="3927/leviticus_24_6.htm">Leviticus 24:6</a>). That there were set six waterpots for the purification of the Jews (<a href="3927/john_2_6.htm">John 2:6</a>). That there were six cities of refuge or of asylum (<a href="3927/numbers_35_6.htm">Numbers 35:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_19_1.htm">Deuteronomy 19:1-9</a>). That the measuring reed with which the angel measured all parts of the new temple and new city was six cubits long (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>). That the prophet drank water by measure, a sixth of a hin (<a href="3927/ezekiel_4_11.htm">Ezekiel 4:11</a>). That they took as an offering a sixth of an ephah of a homer of wheat (<a href="3927/ezekiel_45_13.htm">Ezekiel 45:13</a>).<p>Since the number six symbolizes completeness, therefore words for separating a sixth part came into use, which in the spiritual sense symbolizes something that is complete and entire, as that they gave a sixth part of an ephah of a homer of barley (<a href="3927/ezekiel_45_13.htm">Ezekiel 45:13</a>). And regarding Gog, "I will turn you around and leave but a sixth part of you" (<a href="3927/ezekiel_39_2.htm">Ezekiel 39:2</a>). This last symbolically means that in Gog all truth in the Word having to do with goodness is destroyed. Just who are meant by Gog may be seen in no. <a href="859.htm">859</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 610</h4><p>610. 'His number is six hundred and sixty-six' signifies this quality, that every truth of the Word has been falsified by them. By 'the number of the beast' is signified what the confirmation of the doctrine and faith out of the Word is like with them (<a href="608.htm">608-609</a>); by 'six hundred and sixty-six' is signified every truth of good, and because this is said of the Word, in signifies every truth of good in the Word, here that falsified, because in is 'the number of the beast.' The reason this is signified is because 6 signifies the same as 3 multiplied by 2, and 3 signifies what is full and all, and is predicated of truths (<a href="505.htm">505</a>), while 2 signifies the marriage of truth and good; and as 6 is composed of those two numbers multiplied by each other, they therefore signify every truth of good in the Word, here that falsified. That it has indeed been falsified by them may be seen above (<a href="566.htm">566</a>). The number is said to be 666 because in that number 6 is tripled, and the triplication completes. The multiplying by 100, whence comes 600, and by 10, whence comes sixty, changes nothing, as may be seen above (<a href="348.htm">348</a>).</p><p>[2] That 'six' signifies what is full and all, and is said where it treats of truths of good, can be established out of the passages in the Word where that number is mentioned, but that signification of this number does not clearly appear except to those who see in the spiritual sense the things of which in treats, as that the Lord said that:<p>The seed that fell on good ground yielded fruit, thirty fold, sixty, and a hundred, <a href="3927/mark_4_8.htm">Mark 4:8</a>, <a href="3927/mark_4_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_13_8.htm">Matthew 13:8</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_13_23.htm">23</a>;<p>That:<p>The householder went out and brought labourers into his vineyard, at the third hour and at the sixth hour. <a href="3927/matthew_20_3.htm">Matthew 20:3</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_20_5.htm">5</a>.<p>Upon the table in the tabernacle the cakes of bread were arranged in two rows, six in each. <a href="3927/leviticus_24_6.htm">Leviticus 24:6</a>.<p>Six water-pots were set after the manner of the cleansing of the Jews. <a href="3927/john_2_6.htm">John 2:6</a>.<p>The cities of refuge or asylum were six. <a href="3927/numbers_35_6.htm">Numbers 35:6-7</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_19_1.htm">Deuteronomy 19:1-9</a>.<p>The measuring reed with which the angel measured all things of the new temple and the new city, was six cubits. <a href="3927/ezekiel_40_5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>.<p>The prophet should drink water by measure, the sixth part of an hin. <a href="3927/ezekiel_4_11.htm">Ezekiel 4:11</a>.<p>For an offering they should take the sixth part of an ephah of a homer of wheat. <a href="3927/ezekiel_45_13.htm">Ezekiel 45:13</a>.<p>Since 'six' signifies what is full, therefore the word 'to take a sixth part' (sextare) arose, by which in the spiritual sense is signified what is complete and entire, as that:<p>They should take the sixth part of an ephah of a homer of barley. <a href="3927/ezekiel_45_13.htm">Ezekiel 45:13</a>; and in is said of Gog:<p>I will turn thee back, and take the sixth part of thee. <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_2.htm">Ezekiel 39:2</a>,by which is signified that with them every truth of good in the Word was entirely destroyed. Who are understood by 'Gog' may be seen (<a href="859.htm">859</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 610</h4><p>610. And his number is six hundred sixty-six, signifies this quality, that all the truth of the Word is falsified by them. By "the number of the beast" is signified the quality of the confirmations of doctrine and faith from the Word with them, (<a href="608.htm">608</a>, <a href="609.htm">609</a>); by "six hundred sixty-six" is signified every truth of good, and as this is said of the Word, it signifies every truth of good in the Word, here the same falsified, because it is "the number of the beast." The reason of this signification is, because "six" signifies the same as "three" multiplied by "two;" and "three" signifies what is full and all, and is predicated of truths, (<a href="505.htm">505</a>), and "two" signifies the marriage of truth and good; and as "six" is composed of those two numbers multiplied by each other, it therefore signifies every truth of good in the Word, here the same falsified; that it is also falsified by them may be seen above, (<a href="566.htm">566</a>). The number "six hundred sixty-six" is used, because in that number six is tripled, and triplication completes; the multiplying by one hundred, whence comes "six hundred," and by ten, whence comes "sixty," changes nothing (see <a href="348.htm">348</a>).</p><p>[2] That "six" signifies what is full and all, and is used where the truths of good are treated of, may appear from those passages in the Word where that number occurs; but the signification of this number does not clearly appear except to those who see the things concerning which it treats in the spiritual sense, as when the Lord said:<p>That the seed which fell on good ground, brought forth fruit, some thirty, some sixty, some an hundred, (<a href="3927/mark_4_8.htm">Mark 4:8</a>, <a href="3927/mark_4_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_13_8.htm">Matthew 13:8</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_13_23.htm">23</a>).<p>That the householder went out and brought laborers into his vineyard at the third hour and at the sixth hour, (<a href="3927/matthew_20_3.htm">Matthew 20:3</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_20_5.htm">5</a>).<p>That upon the table in the tabernacle the cakes of bread were arranged in two rows, six in each, (<a href="3927/leviticus_24_6.htm">Leviticus 24:6</a>).<p>That there were set six water pots, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, (<a href="3927/john_2_6.htm">John 2:6</a>).<p>That there were six cities of refuge or asylums, (<a href="3927/numbers_35_6.htm">Numbers 35:6-7</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_19_1.htm">Deuteronomy 19:1-9</a>).<p>That the measuring reed with which the angel measured all parts of the new temple and the new city, was six cubits, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>).<p>That the prophets should drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_4_11.htm">Ezekiel 4:11</a>).<p>That they should take for an offering the sixth part of an ephah of a homer of wheat, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_45_13.htm">Ezekiel 45:13</a>).<p>Because "six" signifies what is full, the word "to take a sixth part," came into use, by which, in the spiritual sense, is signified what is complete and entire; as that:<p>They should offer the sixth part of an ephah out of a homer of wheat, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_45_13.htm">Ezekiel 45:13</a>).<p>And it is said of Gog:<p>I will turn thee back, and leave the sixth part of thee, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_39_2.htm">Ezekiel 39:2</a>).<p>By this is signified that with him every truth of good in the Word was utterly destroyed; who are meant by "Gog," may be seen, (<a href="859.htm">859</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 610 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>610. "Numerus ejus sexcenta (sexaginta) sex," significat quale hoc, quod ab illis omne verum Verbi falsificatum sit. - Per "numerum Bestiae" significatur quale confirmationum doctrinae et fidei ex Verbo apud illos (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_610/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_608" target=_top>608</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_610/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_609" target=_top>609</a>); per "sexcenta sexaginta sex" significatur omne verum boni; et quia hoc de Verbo dicitur, significatur omne verum boni in Verbo, hic illud falsificatum, quia est "numerus Bestiae."
