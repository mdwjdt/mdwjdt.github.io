<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第711节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>711.“大地震，自从地上有人以来，没有这样大的地震”表教会的一切事物仿佛在摇撼、骚动、倾覆并从天上被拽下来。“地震” 表示教会状态的改变（参看<a href="331.htm">331</a>节）；地震有轻有重，此处是最严重的那种，因为经上说“自从有人以来，没有这样大的地震”，故显而易见，“地震”在此表示教会的一切事物在摇撼、骚动、倾覆并从天上被拽下来。经上还论到被称为古蛇、魔鬼和撒旦的这龙，说：</p><p>他的尾巴拖拉着天上星辰的三分之一部分，把它们摔在地上。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.4.htm">12:4</a>）</p><p>公山羊（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.10.htm">8:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.12.htm">12</a>）也一样。主也说到该教会的终结：  </p><p>那时必有大灾难，从世界的起头直到如今，没有这样的灾难，将来也必没有。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.21.htm">24:21</a>）</p><p>在先知书，教会的终结也以摇撼、倾覆和摔在地上，以及其它涉及地震的现象来描述。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 711</h4><p>711. And there was a great earthquake, such as had not occurred since people were on the earth, so great was the earthquake. This symbolizes seeming shocks, convulsions, upsets and drawings down from heaven of every element of the church.<p>Earthquakes symbolize changes in a church's state, as may be seen in no. <a href="331.htm">331</a> above. But because some earthquakes are milder and some more severe, and the one here is very severe, since we are told that such a quake had not occurred since the appearance of people, it is apparent that the earthquake here symbolizes shocks, convulsions, upsets and drawings down from heaven of every element of the church.<p>We are told, too, in regard to the dragon, which is called a serpent, the devil and satan, <sup>1</sup>that its tail drew down from heaven a third of the stars and threw them to the earth (<a href="3927/revelation_12_4.htm">Revelation 12:4</a>). Something similar is said in regard to the male goat in <a href="3927/daniel_8_10.htm">Daniel 8:10-12</a>. The Lord also says regarding the end of the present church:<p>...then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, nor ever shall be. (<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>)<p>The end of the church is described in the prophets as well by shocks, overturnings and castings down of the earth, and many other occurrences attendant on earthquakes.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="3927/revelation_12_9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_2.htm">20:2</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 711</h4><p>711. 'And there was a great earthquake such as has not occurred since there came to be men upon the earth, an earthquake of such magnitude' signifies as it were the tremors, convulsions, overturnings, and acts of dragging down out of heaven of all things of the Church. That by 'earthquakes' changes of state of the Church are signified may be seen above (<a href="331.htm">331</a>); and as earthquakes are lighter and more severe, here the most severe because it is said that 'such an earthquake has not occurred since there came to be men,' it is plain that by the 'earthquake' here are signified the tremors, convulsions, overturnings, and acts of dragging down out of heaven of all things of the Church. It is said also of the dragon, who is called 'the serpent of old, the Devil and Satan,' that:<p>His tail dragged down out of heaven a third part of the stars, and cast them to earth. <a href="3927/revelation_12_4.htm">Revelation 12:4</a>.<p>In like manner of 'the he-goat of the she-goats' (<a href="3927/daniel_8_10.htm">Daniel 8:10-12</a>). The Lord also says of the end of this Church:<p>Then shall be great affliction such as was not from the beginning of the world up to this time, nor shall be. <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>.<p>The end of the Church is also described in the Prophets by earth tremors, overthrowings, castings down, and the many other things attendant on earthquakes. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 711</h4><p>711. And there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, such an earthquake, so great, signifies as it were shakings, convulsions, overturnings, and the drawing down from heaven, of all the things of the church. That by "an earthquake" changes in the state of the church are signified, may be seen above, (<a href="331.htm">331</a>): and as earthquakes are lighter and more severe, here the most severe, because it is said that such an earthquake had not occurred since men were made, it is manifest that by "the earthquake" here are signified the shakings, convulsions, and overturnings of all things in the church, and the drawing of them down from heaven. It is also said of the dragon, who is called the old serpent, the Devil, and Satan, that:<p>His tail drew down from heaven the third part of the stars, and cast them unto the earth, (<a href="3927/revelation_12_4.htm">Revelation 12:4</a>).<p>In like manner of the he-goat, (<a href="3927/daniel_8_10.htm">Daniel 8:10-12</a>). The Lord also says of the end of this church:<p>There shall then be great affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the world to this time, nor ever shall be, (<a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>).<p>The end of the church is also described in the prophets by the shakings, overthrowings, and castings down, of the earth, and by other things which relate to earthquakes. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 711 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>711. "Et terrae motus factus est magnus, qualis non factas ex quo homines facti sunt super terra; talis terrae motus adeo magnus, significat omnium Ecclesiae quasi concussiones, paroxysmos, inversiones, detractiones e Caelo. - Quod per "terrae motus" significentur mutationes status Ecclesiae, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_711/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_331" target=_top>331</a>); et quia terrae motus sunt leviores et graviores (hic gravissimi, quia dicitur, quod talis terrae motus "non factus sit ex quo homines facti sunt"), patet quod per "terrae motum" hic significentur omnium Ecclesiae concussiones, paroxysmi, inversiones, detractiones e Caelo. Dicitur etiam de Dracone, qui vocatur Serpens antiquus, Diabolus et Satanas, quod "Cauda sua detraxerit e Caelo tertiam partem stellarum, et projecerit in terram," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_711/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_4" target=_top>Apocalypsis 12:4</a>);<p>Similiter de Hirco caprarum, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_711/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_8_10-12" target=_top>Daniel 8:10-12</a>).<p>Dicit etiam Dominus de fine hujus Ecclesiae, <p>"Erit tunc afflictio magna, qualis non fuit ab initio mundi usque nunc, nec fient," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_711/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_21" target=_top>Matthaeus 24:21</a>).<p>Finis Ecclesiae describitur etiam apud Prophetas per terrae concussiones, subversiones, dejectiones, et plura quae sunt terrae motuum. </p>
