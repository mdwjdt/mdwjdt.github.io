<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第722节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>722.启17:3.“我在灵里被天使带到旷野去”表他在属灵的状态下被带到那些教会的一切事物被毁灭的人当中。“旷野”表示不再有任何真理的教会，因而其中一切事物都被毁灭（<a href="546.htm">546</a>节）；“在灵里”表示因神性流注而处于属灵的状态，如前所示（<a href="36.htm">36</a>节）；因此，“我在灵里被天使带到旷野去”表示在属灵的状态下被带到那些教会的一切事物被毁灭的人当中。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 722</h4><p>722. <a href="3927/revelation_17_3.htm">17:3</a> So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness. This symbolizes John's being carried away in a spiritual state to people in whom everything of the church had been destroyed.<p>A wilderness symbolizes a church in which there is no longer any truth, thus where everything in it has been destroyed (no. <a href="546.htm">546</a>). And to be in the spirit means, symbolically, to be in a spiritual state as a result of Divine influx, as said in no. <a href="36.htm">36</a> above. Consequently, John's being carried away in the spirit into the wilderness means symbolically that he was carried away in a spiritual state to people in whom everything having to do with the church was destroyed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 722</h4><p>722. [verse 3] 'And he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness' signifies carried away in a spiritual state to those with whom all things of the Church have been devastated. By 'a wilderness' is signified a Church in which there is no longer any truth, thus where all things thereof have been devastated (<a href="546.htm">546</a>); and by to be 'in the spirit' is signified to be in a spiritual state as the result of Divine influx, concerning which [see] above (<a href="36.htm">36</a>). Consequently by 'he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness' is signified to be carried away in a spiritual state to those with whom all things of the Church have been devastated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 722</h4><p>722. Verse 3. And he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness, signifies that he was carried in a spiritual state to those with whom all things of the church were devastated. By "a wilderness" is signified a church in which there is no longer any truth, and thus where all the things of it are devastated, (<a href="546.htm">546</a>); and by being "in the spirit" is signified to be in a spiritual state from the Divine influx, as shown above, (<a href="36.htm">36</a>); hence by "he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness," is signified to be carried in a spiritual state to those with whom all things of the church were devastated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 722 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>722. (Vers. 3.) "Et detulit me in desertum in spiritu," significat in statu spirituali delatum ad illos apud quos omnia Ecclesiae devastata sunt. -Per "desertum" significatur Ecclesia, in qua non est aliquod verum amplius, ita ubi omnia ejus devastata sunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_722/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_546" target=_top>546</a>) et per esse "in spiritu" significatur esse in statu spirituali ex Divino influxu, de quo supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_722/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_36" target=_top>36</a>); inde per "detulit me in desertum in spiritu significatur in statu spirituali delatum esse ad illos apud quos omnia Ecclesiae devastata sunt. </p>
