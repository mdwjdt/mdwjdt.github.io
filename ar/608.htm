<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第608节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>608.“凡有聪明的，可以算计兽的数目”表凡处于来自主的启示之人都能知道通过圣言对这教义和信仰的确认在他们当中是何性质。“有聪明”表示处于来自主的启示；“算计数目”表示知道性质；因为“数目”表示性质（<a href="348.htm">348</a>，<a href="364.htm">364</a>，<a href="448.htm">448</a>节），“算计”表示知道；由于“数目”所表示的性质是真理的性质，并且教会的教义与信仰的一切真理都来自圣言，故它表示他们通过圣言确认的性质；很快就会看到，这也是数目“六百六十六”所表示的性质。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 608</h4><p>608. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast. This symbolically means that one who is enlightened by the Lord can discern the character of the arguments the clergy use from the Word in defense of that doctrine and faith.<p>"Let him who has understanding" means, symbolically, to be in a state of enlightenment from the Lord. To calculate the number means, symbolically, to discern the character - a number symbolizing character (nos. <a href="348.htm">348</a>, <a href="364.htm">364</a>, <a href="448.htm">448</a>), and to calculate meaning, symbolically, to discern. Moreover, because the character symbolized by the number is the character in respect to truth, and all truth having to do with the doctrine and faith of the church is founded on the Word, therefore the character meant is the character of the arguments the clergy use from the Word in defense of that doctrine and faith. This also is the character symbolized by the number 666, which we consider below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 608</h4><p>608. 'Let one having intelligence compute the number of the beast' signifies that he who is in enlightenment from the Lord is able to recognise what the confirmation of that doctrine and faith out of the Word is like with them. 'Having intelligence' signifies to be in enlightenment from the Lord; 'to compute the number' signifies to recognise what it is like; by 'the number' is signified the quality (<a href="348.htm">348</a>, <a href="364.htm">364</a>, <a href="448.htm">448</a>), and by 'to compute' is signified to recognise; and because the quality that is signified by the number is the quality as to truth, and every truth of the doctrine and faith of the Church is out of the Word, therefore the quality of the confirmations out of the Word is understood. This also is the quality that is signified by the number 'six hundred and sixty-six,' concerning which [something] follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 608</h4><p>608. He that hath intelligence let him count the number of the beast, signifies that he who is in enlightenment from the Lord, may know the quality of the confirmations of that doctrine and faith from the Word that is, with them. "To have intelligence" signifies to be in enlightenment from the Lord; "to count the number" signifies to know the quality, "number" signifying quality, (<a href="348.htm">348</a>, <a href="364.htm">364</a>, <a href="448.htm">448</a>), and "to count" signifies to know; and because the quality which is signified by "number" is its quality as to truth, and all the truth of doctrine and faith in the church is from the Word, therefore it means the quality of their confirmations from the Word; this also is the quality which is signified by the number "six hundred sixty-six," as will be seen presently. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 608 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>608. "Habens intelligentiam computet numerum Bestiae," significat quod qui in illustratione a Domino est, cognoscere possit quale confirmationum istius doctrinae et fidei ex Verbo est apud illos.- "Habens intelligentiam" significat in illustratione a Domino esse: "computare numerum, significat cognoscere quale; per "numerum" significatur quale (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_608/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348" target=_top>348</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_608/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_364" target=_top>364</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_608/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_448" target=_top>448</a>), et per "computare" significatur cognoscere; et quia quale, quod per "numerum" significatur, est quale quoad verum, et omne verum doctrinae et fidei Ecclesiae est ex Verbo, ideo intelligitur quale confirmationum ex Verbo; hoc etiam est quale quod significatur per numerum "666," de quo sequitur. </p>
