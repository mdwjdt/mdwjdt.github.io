<h4 align="center">启示录第三章解读</h4><p>启示录3</p><p>1.你要写信给撒狄教会的天使说：这些事是那有神的七灵和七星的说的：我知道你的行为，按名你是活的，其实是死的。</p><p>2.你要警醒！坚固那剩下将近死去的，因我见你的行为，在神面前并不完全。</p><p>3.所以要回想你是怎样领受，怎样听见的，又要遵守，并要悔改。若不警醒，我必临到你那里，如同贼一样。我几时临到你那里，你也决不能知道。</p><p>4.然而在撒狄，你还有几个名字是未曾污秽自己衣服的；他们要穿白衣与我同行，因为他们是配得过的。</p><p>5.凡得胜的，必这样穿白衣，我也必不从生命册上涂抹他的名，且要在我父面前和我父众天使面前认他的名。</p><p>6.圣灵向众教会所说的话，凡有耳的，就应当听！</p><p>7.你要写信给非拉铁非教会的天使说：这些事那圣洁、真实，拿着大卫的钥匙，开了就没有人能关，关了就没有人能开的说的。</p><p>8.我知道你的行为：看哪，我在你面前给你一个敞开的门，是无人能关的，因你略有一点力量，也曾遵守我的道，没有弃绝我的名。</p><p>9.看哪，我要从撒但会堂里将那些自称是犹太人，其实不是，乃是说谎话的人交给你；看哪，我要使他们来在你脚前下拜，也使他们知道我已经爱你了。</p><p>10.你既遵守我忍耐的道，我也必保守你免去试炼的时刻，就是将要临到全世界，来试炼住在地上的人的。</p><p>11.看哪，我必快来，你要持守你所有的，免得人夺去你的冠冕。</p><p>12.得胜的，我要叫他在我神殿中作柱子，他也必不再出去。我又要将我神的名和我神城的名，就是从天上、从我神那里降下来的新耶路撒冷，并我的新名，都写在他上面。</p><p>13.圣灵向众教会所说的话，凡有耳的，就应当听！</p><p>14.你要写信给老底嘉教会的天使说：这些事是那为阿们的，为诚信真实见证的，神工之初始的说的。</p><p>15.我知道你的行为，你也不冷也不热；我巴不得你或冷或热。</p><p>16.你既如温水，也不冷也不热，所以我必从我口中把你吐出去。</p><p>17.因为你说：我是富足，已经发了财，一样都不缺。却不知道你是那可怜、困苦、贫穷、瞎眼、赤身的。</p><p>18. 我劝你向我买火炼的金子，叫你富足；又买白衣穿上，叫你赤身的羞耻不露出来；又买眼药擦你的眼睛，使你能看见。</p><p>19.凡我所疼爱的，我就责备管教他，所以你要发热心，也要悔改。</p><p>20.看哪，我站在门外叩门，若有听见我声音就开门的，我要进到他那里去，我与他，他与我一同坐席。</p><p>21.得胜的，我要赐他在我宝座上与我同坐，就如我得了胜，在父的宝座上与祂同坐一般。</p><p>22.圣灵向众教会所说的话，凡有耳的，就应当听！</p><h4

align="center">诠释</h4><p>154.“你要写信给撒狄教会的天使说”表写给并涉及那些其敬拜已死，或其敬拜没有仁之良善，也没有信之真理的人。具有这种敬拜的人由“撒狄教会”来表示，这从写给它的话明显可知，不过，这些话要照着灵义来理解。所谓死的敬拜，是指单有敬拜形式，如常去教堂，聆听布道，领受圣餐，阅读圣言和敬虔的书籍，谈论神、天堂地狱、死后生命，尤其谈论敬虔，早晚祷告，然而却不渴望知道信之真理，也不想践行仁之良善，以为单单敬拜就能得救。而事实上，没有真理和照着真理的生活，敬拜就只是仁与信的外在形式，里面若没有仁与信，就会隐藏各种邪恶与虚假；因为真正的敬拜由仁与信构成。否则，这敬拜就像果皮，或果实的表面，里面隐藏的是虫子蛀蚀过的烂果肉，这种果实是死的。如今这种敬拜在教会大行其道，这是众所周知的。</p>

"And to the angel of the church in Sardis write, 'These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you are alive, when you are dead.<p>2. Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die, for I have not found your works full before God.<p>3. Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and pay heed and repent. If, then, you will not watch, I will come upon you like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you.<p>4. You have a few names even in Sardis who have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.<p>5. He who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name from the book of life; but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.<p>6. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'<p>7. "And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write, 'These things says He who is holy, who is true, who has the key of David, who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one opens:<p>8. I know your works. See, I have set before you an open door, and no one can shut it; for you have little strength, and have kept My word, and have not denied My name.<p>9. Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, but lie - behold, I will make them come and worship at your feet, and know that I have loved you.<p>10. Because you have kept My command to persevere, I also will keep you from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world, to put to the test those who dwell on the earth.<p>11. Behold, I am coming quickly! Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown.<p>12. He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall go out no more. And I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from My God. Also My new name.<p>13. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'<p>14. "And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, 'These things says the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Beginning of the workmanship of God:<p>15. I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were cold or hot.<p>16. So then, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, it shall come to pass that I vomit you out of My mouth.<p>17. Because you say, "I am rich and wealthy, and have need of nothing," and do not know that you are miserable, wretched and poor, blind and naked,<p>18. I urge you to buy from Me gold refined in the fire, that you may be enriched, and white garments, that you may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and to anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.<p>19. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be zealous, therefore, and repent.<p>20. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.<p>21. To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sit with My Father on His throne.<p>22. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'"<p>THE SPIRITUAL MEANING<p>The Contents of the Whole Chapter<p>People in the Christian world who are engaged in a lifeless worship, one without charity and faith, are described by the church in Sardis (nos. <a href="154.htm">154-171</a>).<p>People who are governed by truths springing from goodness derived from the Lord are described by the church in Philadelphia (nos. <a href="172.htm">172-197</a>).<p>People who base their beliefs sometimes on their own thinking, sometimes on the Word, and so profane holy things, are described by the church in Laodicea (nos. <a href="198.htm">198-223</a>).<p>All of these, too, are called to the Lord's New Church.<p>The Contents of the Individual Verses:<p></p><table><thead><tr><th>Verse Contents</th><th>Spiritual Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.

(<a href="3927/revelation_3_1.htm">3:1</a>) This symbolically means, to people and concerning people who are engaged in a lifeless worship, or in a worship that lacks the goods expressive of charity or the truths connected with faith.<p>That the church in Sardis means people engaged in such worship is apparent from the particulars written to it, understood in their spiritual sense.<p>By lifeless worship we mean simply worship by itself, which consists in people's going often to church, listening to sermons, partaking of the Holy Supper, reading the Word and books of piety, talking about God, heaven and hell, the life after death, and especially piety, and praying morning and evening, and yet without desiring to know any truths of faith or wishing to do any goods of charity, believing that salvation is theirs simply by virtue of their worship. This they believe even though apart from truths, and without a life in accordance with those truths, worship is merely the external mark of charity and faith, which may harbor within it evils and falsities of every kind if charity and faith are not present in it. Charity and faith are what characterize genuine worship. Otherwise worship is like the skin or rind of a piece of fruit, which conceals within rotten or wormy flesh, so that the fruit is dead.<p>People know that such is the worship prevalent in the church today. </p>

And to the Angel of the Church in Sardis write: These things says He Who has the seven spirits of GOD, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.<p>2. Be watchful, and strengthen the things remaining that are ready to die; for I have not found thy works full before GOD.<p>3. Remember therefore how thou hast accepted and heard, and observe and repent. If therefore thou dost not watch, I will come on thee like a thief, and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come upon thee.<p>4. Thou hast a few names even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.<p>5. He who overcomes shall be clothed with white garments; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life; and I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels.<p>6. He who has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the Churches.<p>7. And to the Angel of the Church in Philadelphia write:<p>These things says the Holy True One, having the key of David, opening and no one shuts, and shutting and no one opens.<p>8. I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no one is able to shut it, because thou hast a little power, and hast observed My Word, and hast not denied My Name.<p>9. Behold, I will make (dabo) those of the synagogue of Satan, declaring themselves to be Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make (faciam) them to come and worship at thy feet, and to know that I have chosen thee.<p>10. Because thou hast kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep thee safe from the hour of temptation that is going to come upon the entire world (orbis) to try those dwelling upon the land.<p>11. Behold, I am coming quickly; hold that fast which thou hast, that no one may get thy crown.<p>12. Him who overcomes will I make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall go no more out, and I will write upon him the Name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God, and My new Name.<p>13. He who has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the Churches.<p>14. And to the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write: These things says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Beginning of the work of God.<p>15. I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.<p>16. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am going to spew thee out of My mouth.<p>17. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and do not need anything, and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.<p>18. I counsel thee to buy from Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white garments that thou mayest be clothed, and the shame of thy nakedness may not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eye salve, that thou mayest see.<p>19. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous therefore, and repent.<p>20. Behold I stand at the door (janua) and knock: if any one hears My voice, and opens the door (ostium), I will enter in to him, and will sup with him and he with Me.<p>21. To him who overcomes will I grant to be seated with Me in My throne, as I have overcome, and am seated with the Father in His throne.<p>22.

That those who are in this worship are understood by 'the Church in Sardis' is plain from the things written to it understood in the spiritual sense. By dead worship is understood worship alone, which is that they go to church, hear preachings, attend the Holy Supper, read the Word and books of piety, talk of God, of heaven and hell, of life after death, especially of piety, say prayers morning and evening, and yet do not desire to know the truths of faith nor wish to do the goods of charity, believing that they have salvation by means of worship alone. When in fact worship without truths, and without a life in accordance with them, is only the outward sign of charity and faith, within which there can lie hidden evils and untruths of every kind, unless charity and faith are within. Genuine worship is [the result] of these. Otherwise the worship is like the skin or surface of some fruit, within which the rotten worm-eaten flesh lies hidden; and such a fruit is dead. That such worship is reigning in the Church at this day, is known. </p>

(Vers. 1.) "Et Angelo in Sardibus Ecclesiae scribe," significat ad illos et de illis, qui in cultu mortuo sunt, seu in cultu qui est absque bonis quae charitatis sunt et absque veris quae fidei. - Quod illi qui in eo cultu sunt, per "Ecclesiam in Sardibus" intelligantur, patet a scriptis ad illam in Sensu spirituali intellectis. Per cultum mortuum intelligitur solus cultus, qui est, quod frequentent templa, audiant praedicationes, obeant sacram Caenam, legant Verbum et libros pietatis, loquantur de Deo, de Caelo et Inferno, de vita post mortem, imprimis de pietate, orent mane et vesperi, et usque non desiderant scire vera fidei, nec volunt facere bona charitatis, credentes quod illis per solum cultum sit salus; cum tamen cultus absque veris, et absque vita secundum illa, est modo externum signum charitatis et fidei, intra quod possunt latere omnis generis mala et falsa, si non charitas et fides insunt: harum est genuinus cultus; alioquin est cultus sicut cutis aut superficies alicujus fructus, intra quam latet caro putris et vermicularis, qui fructus est mortuus. Quod talis cultus hodie in Ecclesia sit regnans, notum est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;quae pro "qui"<p>1.&nbsp;e pro "in"<p>1.&nbsp;retine pro "retinete"<p>2.&nbsp;ut pro "et" </p>
