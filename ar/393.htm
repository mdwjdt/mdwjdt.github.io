<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第393节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>393. “有许多香赐给他，要和众圣徒的祈祷一同献在宝座前的金坛上”表挽回祭，免得主的属灵国度的天使被下面撒旦国度的诸灵伤害。“香”与“金坛”表示出于属灵之爱而对主的敬拜（<a href="277.htm">277</a>，<a href="392.htm">392</a>节）；“祈祷”表示那些涉及敬拜中的仁、因而涉及信的事物（<a href="278.htm">278</a>节）；“圣徒”表示那些属于主的属灵国度之人；而“义人”表示那些属于主的属天国度之人（<a href="173.htm">173</a>节）。由此明显可知，此处论述的是那些在主的属灵国度中的人。此处“要和众圣徒的祈祷一同献在金坛上的许多香”表示挽回祭，免得他们被下面撒旦国度的诸灵伤害，因为挽回祭和赎罪祭用香作成，尤其当危险即将来临时。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>当会众攻击摩西和亚伦，遭受瘟疫时，亚伦从坛上取火，往香炉里加上香，跑到活人与死人中间去赎罪，瘟疫就止住了。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民16.42.htm">16:42</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民16.50.htm">50</a>）；</p><p>香坛还被放在会幕内，在法柜上的施恩座前面，每早晨收拾灯时，要烧香。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.1.htm">30:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>而且，亚伦被吩咐每当进入幔子时都要烧香，使香的烟云遮掩施恩座，免得他死亡。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.11.htm">16:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>从这些事明显可知，在代表性的以色列教会，挽回祭是通过烧香来作成的；此处也一样，免得他们被下面的撒旦诸灵伤害。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 393</h4><p>393. And he was given much incense, that he should offer it for the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. This symbolizes a propitiation, lest angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom be harmed by the spirits of the satanic kingdom situated below.<p>The incense and golden altar symbolize worship of the Lord springing from a spiritual love (nos. <a href="277.htm">277</a>, <a href="392.htm">392</a>). Prayers symbolize those expressions of charity and so of faith that are found in worship (no. <a href="278.htm">278</a>). And saints mean people who are of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, while the just or righteous are those of His celestial kingdom (no. <a href="173.htm">173</a>). It can be seen from this that people in the Lord's spiritual kingdom are the subject here.<p>The much incense here, given for the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar, symbolizes a propitiation lest the angels be harmed by the spirits of the satanic kingdom situated below, because incense was used for propitiations and expiations, especially when dangers threatened - as can be seen from the following:<p>When the congregation murmured against Moses and Aaron and they suffered a plague, Aaron took fire from the altar, put incense in the censer, and ran between the living and the dead to make atonement, and the plague was stopped. (<a href="3927/numbers_16_42.htm">Numbers 16:42-50</a>)<p>The altar of incense also was placed in the Tabernacle in front of the mercy seat upon the ark, and incense was offered on it every morning when they trimmed the lamps. (<a href="3927/exodus_30_1.htm">Exodus 30:1-10</a>)<p>Moreover, Aaron was commanded to offer incense whenever he entered inside the veil, and a cloud of incense would cover the mercy seat, lest he die. (<a href="3927/leviticus_16_11.htm">Leviticus 16:11-13</a>)<p>It can be seen from this that in the representational Israelite Church, propitiations were made with the burning of incense. So, too, here, lest the angels be harmed by the satanic spirits living below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 393</h4><p>393. 'And there were given unto him many incense-offerings for him to offer with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar that is before the throne' signifies propitiation lest the angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom should be hurt by the spirits of the satanic kingdom who were below. By 'incense-offerings' and by 'the golden altar' is signified the worship of the Lord out of spiritual love (<a href="277.htm">277</a>, <a href="392.htm">392</a>); by 'prayers' are signified the things that are of charity and consequently of faith in worship (<a href="278.htm">278</a>); and by 'the saints' [or 'holy ones' (sancti)] are understood those who are out of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and by 'the just' those who are out of His celestial kingdom (<a href="173.htm">173</a>). It can be established from these [references] that here it treats of those who are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom. Here, by 'many incense-offerings offered with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar' is signified propitiation, lest they should be hurt by the spirits of the satanic kingdom that was below, because propitiations and expiations used to be made by means of incense-offerings, especially whenever dangers were menacing; as can be established from these [statements]:<p>When the congregation murmured against Moses and Aaron and they were infected with a plague, Aaron took fire from off the altar, and put incense in a censer, and ran between the living and the dead so that he might expiate, and the plague was stayed. <a href="3927/numbers_16_42.htm">Numbers 16:42-50</a> [H.B. 7-15].<p>The altar of incense was placed in the tent before the propitiatory that was over the ark, and every morning when the lamps were being trimmed, incense was burnt upon it, <a href="3927/exodus_30_1.htm">Exodus 30:1-10</a>.<p>And it was commanded that as often as Aaron might enter within the veil, he should burn incense, and the cloud of incense should cover the propitiatory, lest he should die. <a href="3927/leviticus_16_11.htm">Leviticus 16:11-13</a>.<p>It can be established from these things that propitiations in the Israelitish representative Church were made by burnings of incense; in like manner here, lest they should be hurt by the satanic spirits who were below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 393</h4><p>393. And there was given him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne, signifies propitiation lest the angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom should be hurt by the spirits of the satanic kingdom, that were below. By "the incense" and by "the golden altar" is signified the worship of the Lord from spiritual love, (<a href="277.htm">277</a>, <a href="392.htm">392</a>); by "prayers" are signified those things which relate to charity and thence to faith in worship, (<a href="278.htm">278</a>); and by "saints" are meant those who are of the Lord's spiritual kingdom; and by "the just," those who are of His celestial kingdom, (<a href="173.htm">173</a>). From this it may appear, that they who are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom are here treated of. That here "much incense offered with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar" signifies propitiation lest they should be hurt by the spirits of the satanic kingdom who were below, because propitiations and expiations were made by incense, especially when dangers threatened; as may appear from the following passages:<p>When the congregation murmured against Moses and Aaron, and were affected with a plague, Aaron took fire from the altar, and put incense into a censer, and ran between the living and the dead to expiate, and the plague was stayed, (<a href="3927/numbers_16_42.htm">Numbers 16:42-50</a>).<p>The altar of incense was also placed in the tent, before the mercy-seat that was over the ark, and incense was offered on it every morning when the lamps were trimmed, (<a href="3927/exodus_30_1.htm">Exodus 30:1-10</a>).<p>And it was commanded, that as often as Aaron entered within the veil, he should offer incense, and the cloud of incense should cover the mercy-seat, lest he should die, (<a href="3927/leviticus_16_11.htm">Leviticus 16:11-13</a>).<p>From these things it may appear, that propitiations in the representative Israelitish church were made by offering incense; in like manner here, that they might not be hurt by the satanic spirits who were below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 393 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>393. "Et dati sunt illi suffitus multi, ut daret precibus sanctorum omnium super Altare aureum quod coram Throno" significat propitiationem ne Angeli Regni Spiritualis Domini laederentur a spiritibus Regni Satanici, qui infra erant. - Per "suffitus" et per "altare aureum" significatur cultus Domini ex Amore spirituali (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_393/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_277" target=_top>277</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_393/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_392" target=_top>392</a>); per "preces" significantur illa quae charitatis et inde fidei sunt in cultu (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_393/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_278" target=_top>278</a>); et per "sanctos" intelliguntur qui e Regno Spirituali Domini sunt, et per "justos" qui e Regno Caelesti Ipsius (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_393/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173" target=_top>173</a>); ex his constare potest, quod de illis qui in Regno Spirituali Domini sunt, hic agatur. Quod hic per "suffitus multos datos precibus sanctorum omnium super Altare aureum" significetur propitiatio ne laederentur a spiritibus Regni Satanici qui infra erant, est quia propitiationes et expiationes fiebant per suffitus, imprimis quando pericula imminebant; ut constare potest ex his: <p>Cum murmuravit concio contra Mosen et Aharonem, et plaga affecti sunt sumpsit Aharon ignem ex Altari, et in thuribulum dedit suffimentum, et cucurrit inter vivos et mortuos ut expiaret, "et coercita est plaga," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_393/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_17_7" target=_top>Numeri 17:7</a>-15 (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_393/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_16_42-50" target=_top>16:42-50</a>));<p>Altare suffitus etiam positum fuit in Tentorio ante Propitiatorium quod super Arca: et quovis mane, cum adornabantur lucernae, super illo suffiebatur, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_393/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_30_1-10" target=_top>Exodus 30:1-10</a>);<p>Et mandatum est, ut quoties Aharon intraret intra velum, suffiret, ac nubes suffimenti tegeret Propitiatorium, ne moreretur, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_393/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_16_11-13" target=_top>Leviticus 16:11-13</a>).<p>Ex his constare potest quod propitiationes in Ecclesia repraesentativa Israelitica factae fuerint per suffitiones; similiter hic, ne laederentur a spiritibus satanicis, qui infra erant. </p>
