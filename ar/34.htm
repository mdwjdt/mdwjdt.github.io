<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>34.“曾在那名叫拔摩的海岛上”表他能被启示所在的状态和地方。启示之所以在拔摩岛赐给约翰，是因为它是希腊的一个海岛，离迦南地不远，就在亚细亚和欧洲之间。“海岛”表离对神的敬拜较远，但将要靠近它的外邦人，因为他们能被启示。“希腊”所表相同；教会本身则由“迦南地”来表示；“亚细亚”则表那些处于来自圣言的真理之光的教会中人；“欧洲”表那些即将拥有圣言的人；正因如此，“拔摩海岛”表他能被启示所在的状态和地方。在圣言中，“海岛”表离对神的敬拜较远，但将要敬拜神的民族。这一点从以下经文明显可知：</p><p>你们要以乌陵荣耀耶和华，在众海岛荣耀耶和华以色列神的名。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.15.htm">24:15</a>）</p><p>祂不灰心，也不丧胆，直到祂在地上设立公理，海岛都等候祂的训诲。海岛和其上的居民，都当向耶和华唱新歌，从海岛向祂发出赞美。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.4.htm">42:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>众海岛啊，当听从我！远方的众民哪。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.1.htm">49:1</a>）</p><p>海岛都要等候我，信靠我的膀臂。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.5.htm">51:5</a>）</p><p>众海岛必信靠我，首先是他施的船只。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.9.htm">60:9</a>）</p><p>列族啊，要听耶和华的话，在远处的海岛传扬它。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.10.htm">31:10</a>）</p><p>他们各人，就是列族的众海岛，在自己的地方敬拜耶和华。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.11.htm">2:11</a>）</p><p>还有别处的。“希腊”所表相同，这一点从圣言看得不那么明显，因为希腊只在但以理书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.21.htm">8:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.20.htm">10:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但11.2.htm">11:2<sxc）、约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.20.htm">12:20</a>）、马可福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/可7.26.htm">7:26</a>）有所提及。“迦南地”表主的教会，因此被称为“圣地”和“天上的迦南”，这一点这从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来。“亚细亚”表教会中那些处于来自圣言的真理之光的人（参看<a href="11.htm">11</a>节）；显然，“欧洲”表那些即将拥有圣言的人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 34</h4><p>34. I was on the island called Patmos. This symbolizes a state and place in which he could be enlightened.<p>The revelation to John occurred on Patmos because it was an island in Greece, not far from the land of Canaan, and between Asia and Europe; and islands symbolize nations relatively removed from the worship of God, but which will yet accede to it, because they can be enlightened. Greece has a similar meaning. But the church itself is meant by the land of Canaan. Asia symbolizes those of the church who from the Word have the light of truth, and Europe those to whom the Word will come. The island of Patmos accordingly symbolizes a state and place in which John could be enlightened.<p>That islands in the Word symbolize nations relatively removed from the worship of God, but which will yet accede to it, is apparent from the following passages:<p>In the Urim honor Jehovah, in the islands of the sea the name of... the God of Israel. (<a href="3927/isaiah_24_14.htm">Isaiah 24:14</a>)<p>He will not extinguish nor break in pieces till He has set judgment in the earth, and the islands hope in His law... Sing to Jehovah a new song..., let the islands and the inhabitants of them... give glory to Jehovah, and declare His praise in the islands. (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_42_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_42_12.htm">12</a>)<p>Listen, O islands, to Me, and... you peoples from afar! (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_1.htm">Isaiah 49:1</a>)<p>The islands will hope in Me, and on My arm they will trust. (<a href="3927/isaiah_51_5.htm">Isaiah 51:5</a>)<p>...In Me the islands will trust, and the ships of Tarshish... (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_9.htm">Isaiah 60:9</a>)<p>Hear the words of Jehovah, O nations, and declare them in the islands afar off. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>)<p>...that they may worship Jehovah, each one in his place, all the islands of the nations. (<a href="3927/zephaniah_2_11.htm">Zephaniah 2:11</a>)<p>And elsewhere.<p>That Greece has also a similar meaning is not so apparent from the Word, because Greece is mentioned only in <a href="3927/daniel_8_21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_10_20.htm">10:20</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_11_2.htm">11:2</a>, <sup>1</sup>as also in <a href="3927/john_12_20.htm">John 12:20</a>, <a href="3927/mark_7_26.htm">Mark 7:26</a>. <sup>2</sup><p>That the land of Canaan means the Lord's church, which is therefore called "the Holy Land" and "the heavenly Canaan," is apparent from many places in the Word.<p>That Asia means those in the church who from the Word have the light of truth, may be seen in no. <a href="11.htm">11</a> above. And that Europe means those to whom the Word will come, follows.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Greece is mentioned in [NCBSP: <a href="3927/zechariah_9_13.htm">Zechariah 9:13</a>] too, but it was not so translated in the <a href="../ac/1696.htm">1696</a> Latin Bible of Sebastian Schmidt, which the writer regularly used.<p>2.&nbsp;The references here, as elsewhere, are to Greeks, rather than Greece. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 34</h4><p>34. Was in the isle called Patmos' signifies the state and situation in which he could be enlightened. That the Revelation of John was produced in Patmos was on account of its being an island in Greece, not far from the land of Canaan, and between Asia and Europe; and by 'isles' are signified nations more out of the way from the worship of God, but who yet are going to draw near to that worship because they can be enlightened. The like [is signified] by 'Greece.' But the Church itself [is signified] by 'the land of Canaan,' by 'Asia' those belonging to the Church [are signified] who are in the light of the truth (veritas) out of the Word, and by 'Europe' those to whom the Word is going to come. It is in consequence of this that by 'the isle Patmos' is signified the state and situation in which he could be enlightened. That by 'isles' in the Word are signified nations more remote from the worship of God, but who are yet going to draw near to that worship, is plain from these passages:<p>Honour Jehovah in the Urim, the Name of the God of Israel in the isles of the sea. <a href="3927/isaiah_24_15.htm">Isaiah 24:15</a>.<p>He shall not extinguish nor break in pieces, till He set judgment in the earth, and the isles hope in His law. Sing unto Jehovah a new song, the isles and the inhabitants thereof shall propose glory to Jehovah, and they will declare His praise in the islands. <a href="3927/isaiah_42_4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_42_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_42_12.htm">12</a>.<p>Listen unto Me attentively, O isles and the peoples from afar. <a href="3927/isaiah_49_1.htm">Isaiah 49:1</a>.<p>The isles shall hope in Me, and on Mine arm shall they trust. <a href="3927/isaiah_51_5.htm">Isaiah 51:5</a>.<p>The isles shall trust in Me, and the ships of Tarshish. <a href="3927/isaiah_60_9.htm">Isaiah 60:9</a>.<p>Hear the words of Jehovah, O nations, and declare [them] in the isles from afar. <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>.<p>That they may worship Jehovah, every one in his place, all the isles of the nations, <a href="3927/zephaniah_2_11.htm">Zephaniah 2:11</a> and elsewhere. That the like [is signified] by 'Greece' is not plain in this manner from the Word, since Greece has only been mentioned by name [in] <a href="3927/daniel_8_21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_10_20.htm">10:20</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_11_2.htm">11:2</a>; as also. <a href="3927/john_12_20.htm">John 12:20</a>; <a href="3927/mark_7_26.htm">Mark 7:26</a>. That by 'the land of Canaan' the Lord's Church is understood, and this is thence called 'the Holy Land' and 'the heavenly Canaan,' is plain from many passages in the Word. It may be seen above (<a href="11.htm">11</a>) that those in the Church who are in the light of the truth (veritas) out of the Word are understood by 'Asia'; and it is consistent [with this] that those to whom the Word is going to come are understood by 'Europe. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 34</h4><p>34. I was in the island called Patmos, signifies a state and place in which he could be enlightened. The reason that the Revelation was made to John in Patmos, was, because it was an island in Greece, not far from the land of Canaan, and between Asia and Europe; and by "islands" are signified the Gentiles more remote from the worship of God, but yet which are about to draw near to it, because they can be enlightened. The same is signified by Greece; but the church itself is signified by "the land of Canaan;" by "Asia," those of the church who are in the light of truth from the Word; and, by "Europe," those to whom the Word is about to come; thence it is, that by "the island of Patmos," is signified a state and place in which he could be enlightened. That by "islands" in the Word are signified the nations which are more remote from the worship of God, but which yet will draw near to it, is evident from these passages:<p>Honor Jehovah in the Urim, the name of the God of Israel in the Islands of the sea, (<a href="3927/isaiah_24_15.htm">Isaiah 24:15</a>).<p>He shall not extinguish nor break until He set judgment in the earth, and let the islands hope in His law.

That the same is signified by "Greece," is not so evident from the Word, because Greece is mentioned only in <a href="3927/daniel_8_21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_10_20.htm">10:20</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_11_2.htm">11:2</a>; as also in <a href="3927/john_12_20.htm">John 12:20</a>; <a href="3927/mark_7_26.htm">Mark 7:26</a>.
