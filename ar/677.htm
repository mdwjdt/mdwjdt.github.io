<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第677节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>677.启16:2.“第一位便去，把他的香瓶倒在地上”表（该流注）进入那些处于改革宗教会的内在，研究唯信称义教义，被称为神职人员的人里面。“倒香瓶”表示流注，如前所述（<a href="676.htm">676</a>节）。“地”表示教会（<a href="285.htm">285</a>节），在此表示教会中那些处于教会内层的人，就是诸如研究唯信称义教义之类的人。这些人还声称他们知道教会的内在事物；但这些内在事物只不过是对这一观点的确认：唯信称义，无需律法行为。至于其它内在事物，他们就不知道了；由于这些人主要是牧师，神学教授和大学讲师，简言之，就是博士和牧者，所以这第一波流注进入他们这些被称为神职人员的人里面。之所以是指他们，是因为经上说，第一位天使把香瓶倒在“地”上，第二位天使把香瓶倒在“海”里；而“地”表示那些处于教会内在之人当中的教会；“海”表示那些处于教会外在之人当中的教会（<a href="398.htm">398</a>，<a href="403.htm">403</a>，<a href="420.htm">420</a>，<a href="470.htm">470</a>节）；所表示的是这些人，这一点也可从经上说就有恶而且毒的“疮”生在他们身上明显看出来。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 677</h4><p>677. <a href="3927/revelation_16_2.htm">16:2</a> So the first went and poured out his bowl upon the earth. This symbolizes influx into those taken up with the interior tenets of the church of the Protestant Reformed, who study the doctrine of justification by faith alone and are called the clergy.<p>To pour out the bowl symbolizes influx, as in no. <a href="676.htm">676</a> above. The earth symbolizes the church (no. <a href="285.htm">285</a>), here the church in people there who are taken up with its interior tenets, namely people who study the doctrine of justification by faith alone. They also claim to know its interior tenets. But these interior tenets are only arguments in support of a single position, that faith alone justifies apart from works of the law. These are the only interior tenets they know. And because those taken up with them are especially priests, professors of theology and college lecturers - in short, teachers and pastors - therefore this first influx took place into those who are called the clergy. That these are the people meant is because we are told that the first angel poured out his bowl onto the earth, and the second angel onto the sea; and in that case the earth means the church in people concerned with its internal elements, and the sea means people concerned with its external ones, as in nos. <a href="398.htm">398</a>, <a href="403.htm">403</a>, <a href="404.htm">404</a>, <a href="420.htm">420</a>, <a href="470.htm">470</a> above. That these are the people meant is apparent also from the fact that we are told a sore was formed in them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 677</h4><p>677. [verse 2] 'And the first angel went away and poured out his phial upon the land' signifies into those who are in the interior things of the Church of the Reformed and busy themselves with the doctrine of justification by faith alone, who are called the clergy. By 'to pour out the phial' is signified an influx, as above (<a href="676.htm">676</a>). By 'the land' is signified the Church (<a href="285.htm">285</a>), here with those there who are in its interior things, who are those who busy themselves with the doctrine of justification by faith alone. These also say that they know its interior things; but the interior things are only confirmations of the one thesis that faith alone justifies without the works of the law. They are ignorant of other interior things. And because in those [confirmations] are chiefly the priests, professors of theology, and college lecturers, in a word, the teachers and leaders (Doctores et Pastores), therefore this first influx was effected into those who are called the clergy. The reason why these are the ones understood is because the first angel poured his phial onto 'the land,' and the second into 'the sea,' and then by 'the land' is understood the Church with those who are in the internal things thereof, and by 'the sea' is understood the Church with those who are in the external things thereof, as above (<a href="398.htm">398</a>, <a href="403.htm">403-404</a>, <a href="420.htm">420</a>, <a href="470.htm">470</a>). That these are understood is plain also on account of its being said that a sore' was produced in them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 677</h4><p>677. Verse 2. (<a href="3927/revelation_16_2.htm">Revelation 16:2</a>) And the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth, signifies influx into those who are in the interiors of the church of the Reformed and study the doctrine of justification by faith alone, who are called the clergy. By "pouring out his vial" is signified influx, as above, (<a href="676.htm">676</a>). By "the earth" is signified the church, (<a href="285.htm">285</a>), here those therein who are in its interiors who are such as study the doctrine of justification by faith alone. These also say that they know its interior things; but these interior things are only confirmations of this single position, that faith alone justifies without the works of the Law. Other interior things they do not know; and as these are chiefly priests, professors of theology, and lecturers in colleges, in short doctors and pastors, therefore this first influx was into them, who are called the clergy. The reason why they are meant, is because it is said that the first angel poured out his vial into "the earth" and the second angel into "the sea," and then by "the earth," is meant the church with those who are in its internals, and by "the sea" is meant the church with those who are in its externals, as above, (<a href="398.htm">398</a>, <a href="403.htm">403</a>, <a href="420.htm">420</a>, <a href="470.htm">470</a>); that these are meant, is also evident from its being said that there came "a sore" upon them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 677 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>677. (Vers. 2.) "Et abivit primus et effudit phialam super terram," significat in illos qui in interioribus Ecclesiae Reformatorum sunt, et doctrinae justificationis per solam Fidem student, qui vocantur Clerici. - Per "effundere phialam" significatur influxus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_677/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_676" target=_top>676</a>); per "terram" significatur Ecclesia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_677/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_285" target=_top>285</a>), hic apud illos ibi qui in interioribus ejus sunt, qui sunt qui doctrinae justificationis per solam Fidem student; hi quoque dicunt se interiora ejus scire; at interiora sunt modo confirmationes unius positionis, quod sola Fides justificet absque Operibus Legis; alia interiora non sciunt; et quia in illis praecipue sunt Sacerdotes, Professores Theologiae et Lectores Gymnasiorum, verbo Doctores et Pastores, ideo primus hic influxus in illos, qui vocantur Clerici, factus est; quod illi sint qui intelliguntur, est quia dicitur quod primus Angelus effuderit phialam in "terram," et secundus Angelus in "mare," et tunc per "terram" intelligitur Ecclesia apud illos qui in internis ejus sunt, et per "mare" intelligitur Ecclesia apud illos qui in externis ejus sunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_677/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_398" target=_top>398</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_677/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_403" target=_top>403</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_677/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_404" target=_top>404</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_677/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_420" target=_top>420</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_677/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_470" target=_top>470</a>); quod illi intelligantur, patet etiam ex eo, quod dicatur quod "factum sit ulcus in illis." </p>
