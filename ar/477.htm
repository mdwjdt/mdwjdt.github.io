<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第477节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>477.启10:7.“但在第七位天使发声的日子，就是他要吹号的时候”表对教会状态的最后审查和显明，若主不建立一个新教会，该教会必灭亡。“吹号”表示审查并显明那些属教会之人的生命状态，因而审查并显明教会的状态（参看<a href="397.htm">397</a>节）；由于有七个天使吹号，所以“第七位天使发声”就表示最后的审查和显明，以表明若主不建立一个新教会，该教会即将灭亡；“不再有时日了”就表示这个教会即将灭亡（<a href="476.htm">476</a>节），而接下来的话则表示主将要建立一个新教会。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 477</h4><p>477. But in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound. (<a href="3927/revelation_10_7.htm">10:7</a>) This symbolizes the final examination and exposure of the state of the church - that it will perish if the Lord does not establish a new one.<p>Sounding a trumpet means, symbolically, to examine and expose the state of life of people in the church, thus also the state of the church, as may be seen in no. <a href="397.htm">397</a> above. And because there were seven angels who sounded, the sounding of the seventh angel symbolizes the final examination and exposure, showing that the church would perish if the Lord did not establish a new one. That it would perish is meant by the statement that there should be no more time (no. <a href="476.htm">476</a>); and that the Lord would establish a new one is meant by the statement that follows next. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 477</h4><p>477. [verse 7] 'But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is going to sound' signifies the final examination and making manifest of the state of the Church, which is going to perish if the New one is not set up by the Lord. That by 'to sound' a trumpet is signified to examine and make manifest the state of the life of those who belong to the Church, consequently also the state of the Church, may be seen above (<a href="397.htm">397</a>); and because seven angels were sounding, by 'the voice of the seventh angel' is signified the final examination and making manifest, which is that the Church is going to perish if the New one is not set up by the Lord. Its being about to perish is understood by 'that time shall not be any more' (<a href="476.htm">476</a>), and that a new Church is going to be set up by the Lord is understood by the things that now follow. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 477</h4><p>477. Verse 7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is about to sound, signifies the final exploration and manifestation of the state of the church, which must perish, unless the new one be established by the Lord. That by "sounding a trumpet" is signified to explore and manifest the state of life of those who are of the church, consequently the state of the church, may be seen above, (<a href="397.htm">397</a>); and seven angels sounded, by "the voice of the seventh angel" is signified the final exploration and manifestation, which is that the church is about to perish, unless the New one be established by the Lord; that it is about to perish, is meant by "there being time no longer" (<a href="476.htm">476</a>), and that the New Church is to be established by the Lord, is meant by what now follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 477 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>477. (Vers. 7.) "Sed in diebus vocis septimi Angeli, quando futurus clangere" significat explorationem et manifestationem status Ecclesiae finalem, quod peritura (sit), si non Nova a Domino instauretur. - Quod per "clangere tuba" significetur explorare et manifestare statum vitae illorum qui ab Ecclesia sunt, proinde etiam statum Ecclesiae, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_477/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_397" target=_top>397</a>); et quia septem Angeli clangebant, per "vocem septimi Angeli" significatur exploratio et manifestatio finalis, quae est quod Ecclesia peritura sit, si non Nova a Domino instauretur; quod peritura sit, intelligitur per quod "tempus non erit amplius (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_477/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_476" target=_top>476</a>), et quod nova Ecclesia a Domino instauranda sit, intelligitur per illa quae nunc sequuntur. </p>
