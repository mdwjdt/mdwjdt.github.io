<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第344节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>344.启7:2.“我又看见另有一位天使，从日出之地上来”表主预备并管控。此处“天使”表示主的神性之爱，因为祂“从日出之地上来”；“从日出之地”或从东方，就是从神性之爱；因为在灵界，主就是太阳和东方，就神性之爱而言也被如此称呼。祂在预备并管控，这一点从祂吩咐四位天使“不可伤害地、海，等神的众仆人额上被盖上印”明显看出来。“天使”或“使者”在至高意义上表示主的神性人，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>耶和华面前的使者拯救他们；祂以慈爱和怜悯救赎他们，在古时的日子常保抱他们、怀搋他们。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.9.htm">63:9</a>）</p><p>救赎我脱离一切患难的那使者赐福与他们。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创48.16.htm">48:16</a>）</p><p>你们所寻求的主必忽然来到祂的殿，立约的使者，就是你们所仰慕的。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.1.htm">3:1</a>）</p><p>看哪！我差遣使者在你前面，在路上保护你，因为我的名就在他中间。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.20.htm">23:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.23.htm">23</a>）</p><p>在希伯来语，“天使”和“被差遣的”用是一个词来表达；正因如此，主经常自称是“父所差来的”，以此来表示祂的神性人。不过，就相对意义而言，“天使或使者”是指凡接受主的人，无论在天堂还是在世上。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 344</h4><p>344. Then I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun. (<a href="3927/revelation_7_2.htm">7:2</a>) This symbolizes the Lord providing and moderating.<p>The angel here means the Lord in respect to Divine love, because he ascended from the rising of the sun, and from the rising of the sun or from the east means from Divine love. For in the spiritual world the Lord is the sun and the east, and He is called that in respect to that love. His providing and moderating is apparent from His commandment to the four angels not to harm the earth and sea till the servants of God had been sealed on their foreheads.<p>That in the highest sense an angel means the Lord's Divine humanity is apparent from the following verses:<p>...the Angel of (Jehovah's) presence delivered them because of His love and His clemency. He redeemed them, and took them up, and carried them all the days of eternity. (<a href="3927/isaiah_63_9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>)<p>The Angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless (them). (<a href="3927/genesis_48_16.htm">Genesis 48:16</a>)<p>The Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to His temple, even the Angel of the covenant, whom you are desiring. (<a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>)<p>...I send an Angel before you to keep you in the way... Beware of his presence...; for My name is in the midst of him. (<a href="3927/exodus_23_20.htm">Exodus 23:20-23</a>)<p>"Angel" and "one sent" are, in Hebrew, the same word. That is why the Lord so often calls Himself one sent by the Father, meaning by it His Divine humanity.<p>In a relative sense, on the other hand, an angel is anyone who accepts the Lord, whether in heaven or in the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 344</h4><p>344. [verse 2] 'And I saw another angel coming up out of the rising of the suns signifies the Lord providing and moderating. By the 'angel' here is understood the Lord as to Divine Love, because He came up 'out of the rising of the sun,' and from the rising of the sun or from the east is out of Divine Love, for the Lord is the Sun and the East in the spiritual world, and also is so called as to that love. That He is providing and moderating is plain from His command to the four angels, that they should 'do no harm' to land and sea 'till the servants of God' had been 'sealed upon [their] foreheads.' That the Lord's Divine Human is understood by 'an angel' in the highest sense is plain from these [statements]:<p>The angel of the faces of Jehovah delivered them on account of His love and forbearance: He redeemed them, and adopted them, and carried them all the days of eternity. <a href="3927/isaiah_63_9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>.<p>The angel who redeemed me from every evil, bless them. <a href="3927/genesis_48_16.htm">Genesis 48:16</a>.<p>The Lord, Whom you seek, shall suddenly come to His temple, and the angel of the covenant, whom you desire, <a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3</a>:[<a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">1</a>].<p>I am sending an angel in front of thee, to keep thee in the way; be on thy guard against His face, for My Name is in the midst of Him, <a href="3927/exodus_22_20.htm">Exodus 22:20-23</a>.<p>'Angel' and 'sent' are one word in the Hebrew tongue. This is why the Lord so often calls Himself 'One sent by the Father,' by which is understood the Divine Human. But 'angel' in a relative sense is every one who receives the Lord, whether he be in heaven or in the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 344</h4><p>344. Verse 2. And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, signifies the Lord providing and regulating. "An angel" here means the Lord as to the Divine love, because He ascended "from the rising of the sun," and "from the rising of the sun" or from the east is from the Divine love, for in the spiritual world the Lord is the sun and the east, and is so called as to that love. That He was providing and moderating is evident from His command to the four angels, "not to hurt the earth and the sea, till the servants of God were sealed on their foreheads." That the Lord's Divine Human is meant by "an angel," in the highest sense is manifest from these passages:<p>The angel of the faces of Jehovah delivered them; on account of His love and His pity, He redeemed them, and He bare them, and carried them all the days of eternity, (<a href="3927/isaiah_63_9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>).<p>The angel who redeemed me from all evil bless them, (<a href="3927/genesis_48_16.htm">Genesis 48:16</a>).<p>The Lord whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to His temple, and the angel of the covenant, whom ye desire, (<a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>).<p>Behold, I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way, beware of his face, for My name is in the midst of him, (<a href="3927/exodus_23_20.htm">Exodus 23:20-23</a>).<p>"Angel" and "sent" in the Hebrew language, are expressed by one word; hence it is that the Lord so often calls himself "sent by the Father," by which is meant the Divine Human. But "an angel," in a relative sense is everyone who receives the Lord, both in heaven and in the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 344 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>344. (Vers. 2.) "Et vidi alium Angelum ascendentem et ortu solis," significat Dominum providentem et moderantem. - Per "Angelum" hic intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Amorem, quia ascendit "ex ortu solis;" et ab "ortu solis" seu ab oriente, est ex Divino Amore, est enim Dominus in mundo spirituali Sol et Oriens, et quoque ita vocatur quoad illum Amorem; quod sit providens et moderans, patet a mandato Ipsius ad quatuor Angelos, quod "non damno afficerent terram et mare, usque dum servi Dei signati fuerint super frontibus." Quod Divinum Humanum Domini per "Angelum" in supremo Sensu intelligatur, patet ex his: <p>"Angelus facierum Jehovae liberavit eos, ob amorem Suum et clementiam Suam: Hic redemit illos, et assumpsit illos, et portavit illos omnibus diebus aeternitatis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_344/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_63_9" target=_top>Esaias 63:9</a>);<p>"Angelus Qui redemit me ab omni malo, benedicat illis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_344/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_48_16" target=_top>Genesis 48:16</a>);<p>"Subito veniet ad Templum Suum Dominus Quem vos quaeritis, et Angelus foederis Quem vos desideratis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_344/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_malachi_3_1" target=_top>Malachias 3:1</a>);<p>"Ego mitto Angelum coram te, ad custodiendum te in via; caveto tibi a faciebus Ejus, quia Nomen Meum in medio Ejus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_344/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_23_20-23" target=_top>Exodus 23:20-23</a>).<p>"Angelus" et "missus" in Lingua Hebraea sunt una vox; inde est, quod Dominus toties Se dicat "Missum a Patre," per quod intelligitur Divinum Humanum. "Angelus" autem in sensu respectivo est omnis qui recipit Dominum, tam qui in Caelo est quam qui in mundo. </p>
