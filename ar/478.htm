<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>478.“神的奥秘就成全了，正如神向祂的仆人众先知所宣告的”表到那时，新旧约圣言中被隐藏至今的预言，以及对那些毁灭教会的人施行最后审判之后，主的国即将到来，就会变得显而易见。“就成全了”表示完成了，有了一个结局，然后显现出来。“向众先知宣告神的奥秘”表示主在圣言中被隐藏至今的预言。“宣告”（传福音）表示宣布主的到来及其国度，因为福音是报佳音的。对那些毁灭教会的人施行最后审判之后，这一切就会实现。这一点在圣言中也预言了，故所表示的也是这一点。由此明显可知，这些话表示所有这些事。</p><p>首先，有必要说一下新旧约圣言中论到主的到来及其国度的预言。在名为先知书的旧约圣言中，就属灵之义，以及属世之义中放射出属灵之义的地方而言，经上唯独论述主，也就是说，论述时期满了之时祂的到来，即当教会的仁之良善和信之真理都不复存在之时，教会的这种状态就被称为“结局”、“荒废”、“荒凉”和“判决”。经上还论述了祂与地狱的争战并战胜它们，这些事同样构成祂所施行的最后审判；以及后来新天的创造和新教会的建立，也就是那要来的主的国度。这些事在名为福音书的新约圣言也有论述，在启示录则有专门论述。</p><p>在第七位天使发声的日子所宣告的正是主的国度，这一点明显可见于下一章，即第十一章的以下经文：</p><p>第七位天使吹号，天上就有大声音说，世上的国成了我们主和主基督的，祂要掌权，世世无穷；二十四位长老就俯面敬拜神，说，今在、昔在、将要来的主神啊，我们感谢你，因为你执掌大权接管这国了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.15.htm">11:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.17.htm">17</a>）</p><p>但以理书以几乎和此处启示录一样的方式描述了这个奥秘，那里有这些话：</p><p>我听见那穿细麻衣的人，向天举起左右手，指着活到永远的主起誓说，要到一载二载、半载（the stated time of stated times and a half），这一切事就都应验了；他说，但以理，你只管去，因为这些话已经隐藏封闭，直到末时。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但12.7.htm">12:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但12.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>“直到末时”是指直到这个时候。这时，人子要得祂以这些话所预言的国：</p><p>我在夜间的异象中观看，看哪，有一位像人子的，驾着天云而来；得了权柄、荣耀、国度，各民、各族、各语言的人都事奉祂。祂的权柄是永远的权柄，不能废去，祂的国永不灭亡。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.13.htm">7:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.14.htm">14</a>）</p><p>至于“报好信息”（传福音）表示那时主的到来及其国度，这从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>报好信息的锡安啊，你要登高山；报好信息的耶路撒冷的啊，你要极力扬声；说，看哪，你们的神；看哪，主耶和华大有能力地降临，祂的膀臂必为他掌权。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.9.htm">40:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>那报佳音、使我们听见平安、报好信、使我们听见救恩的，对锡安说，你的神掌权了，这人的脚登山何等佳美！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛52.7.htm">52:7</a>；那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿1.15.htm">1:15</a>）</p><p>要向耶和华歌唱，祝颂祂的名，天天传扬祂救恩的好消息。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗96.2.htm">96:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗96.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>主耶和华的灵在我身上，因此耶和华膏我，叫我传福音给贫穷的人，报告被掳的得释放，报告耶和华悦纳之年。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.1.htm">61:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>天使对撒迦利亚说，看哪，你的妻子要生一个儿子，他必有以利亚的灵和能力行在主的前面，为主预备百姓。我是加百列，奉差将这好消息报给你。（路加福音1；13，17，19）；</p><p>那天使对牧羊人说，不要惧怕；看哪，我报给你们大喜的好信息，因今天在大卫的城里，为你们生了救主，就是主基督。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.10.htm">2:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.11.htm">11</a>）</p><p>主宣扬神国度的好消息或福音。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.23.htm">4:23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太9.35.htm">9:35</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太9.35.htm">9:35</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.15.htm">15</a> ；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路7.22.htm">7:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.1.htm">8:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.1.htm">9:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>施洗约翰也是。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路3.18.htm">3:18</a>）</p><p>主还对门徒说，你们信全世界去，传福音给凡受造的。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可16.15.htm">16:15</a>）</p><p>这也是飞在空中的天使所有、要传给住在地上的人的“永远的福音”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.6.htm">14:6</a>）。</p><p>经上说“神的奥秘就成全了”，意思是说，之前未曾实现的事，也就是这国将是主的，要得以实现。犹太人没有实现这事，是因为他们不承认主。基督徒也没有实现这事，是因为他们不承认主就其人性而言，也是天地之神，反而将这人性视为另一人的人性；所以他们没有直接转向祂；而祂就是那来到世间的耶和华。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 478</h4><p>478. The mystery of God would be concluded, as He declared to His servants the prophets. This symbolically means that then will appear what was foretold in the Word of both Testaments and previously concealed, that after the Last Judgment upon those people who have destroyed the church, the Lord's kingdom will come.<p>To be concluded means, symbolically, to be fulfilled, to come to an end, and then to reappear. The mystery of God declared to the prophets symbolizes something foretold by the Lord in the Word and previously concealed. To declare good news means, symbolically, to proclaim the coming of the Lord and His kingdom, for the gospel is happy news. That this would come about after the Last Judgment was executed on the people who destroyed the church was also foretold in the Word. Therefore this, too, is symbolically meant.<p>It can be seen from this that all of these meanings are contained in these words.</p><p>[2] First we must say something here about the Lord's advent and His kingdom's being foretold in the Word of both Testaments:<p>In the Word of the Old Testament, in the spiritual sense of the prophetic portion, and also in its natural sense wherever the spiritual sense shines through, the subject is the Lord alone, namely, His advent in the fullness of time, a time when the goodness of charity and the truth of faith would no longer be present in the church, whose state then is called a consummation, a being laid waste, a desolation, and a cutting off. It includes as well His battles with the hells and victories over them, which constitute also the last judgment that He executed, and after that the creation of a new heaven and the establishment of a new church, which are the Lord's kingdom to come. All of this is found in the Word of the New Testament, too, in the portion called the Gospels, and in particular in the book of Revelation.</p><p>[3] That it is the Lord's kingdom that would be declared in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel is apparent in the next chapter (chapter 11) from the following:<p>Then the seventh angel sounded: and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!" And the twenty-four elders... fell on their faces and worshiped God, saying, "We give You thanks, O Lord God..., who are and who were and who are to come, because You have taken Your great power and reigned. (<a href="3927/revelation_11_15.htm">Revelation 11:15-17</a>)</p><p>[4] This mystery, in almost the same words as in Revelation here, is described in Daniel, where we find the following:<p>I heard the man clothed in linen..., when he held up his (hands) to heaven, and swore by Him who lives forever, that it shall be for a set time of set times and a half..., when... all these things shall be finished... But he said, "Go your way, Daniel, for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end." (<a href="3927/daniel_12_7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_12_9.htm">9</a>)<p>Till the time of the end refers to the present time. That the Son of Man would then receive His kingdom - this Daniel foretells in these words:<p>I was watching in the night visions, and behold, One like the Son of Man, coming with the clouds of heaven! ...Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, and all peoples, nations, and languages will worship Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom one which shall not perish. (<a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>)</p><p>[5] That declaring good news symbolizes the Lord's advent and His kingdom then, is apparent from the following passages:<p>Get up into the... mountain, O Zion, who brings good tidings; lift up your voice with strength, O Jerusalem, who brings good tidings... Say..., "Behold your God!" Behold, the Lord Jehovih is coming with strength, and His arm shall rule for Him. (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_9.htm">Isaiah 40:9-10</a>)<p>How delightful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who proclaims peace, who brings glad tidings of goodness, who proclaims salvation, who says to Zion, "Your King shall reign!" (<a href="3927/isaiah_52_7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>, cf. <a href="3927/nahum_1_15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>)<p>Sing to Jehovah, bless in His name; proclaim the good news of His salvation from day to day... ...Jehovah, for He is coming... (<a href="3927/psalms_96_2.htm">Psalms 96:2</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_96_13.htm">13</a>)<p>The Spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon Me; therefore Jehovah has anointed Me to bring good tidings to the poor..., to proclaim liberty to the captives..., to proclaim the year of Jehovah's good pleasure... (<a href="3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>)<p>The angel said to (Zacharias), "(Behold)..., your wife... will bear... a son..., (who) will go before (the Lord God) in the spirit and power of Elijah..., to prepare a people for the Lord... I am Gabriel..., and I was sent... to bring you these glad tidings." (<a href="3927/luke_1_13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_19.htm">19</a>)<p>...the angel said to (the shepherds), "Do not be afraid, ...behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy... For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord." (<a href="3927/luke_2_10.htm">Luke 2:10-11</a>)<p>The Lord brought good tidings of the kingdom of God: <a href="3927/matthew_4_23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_9_35.htm">9:35</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_14.htm">Mark 1:14-15</a>. So did John the Baptist: <a href="3927/luke_3_18.htm">Luke 3:18</a>.<p>The Lord also said to the Disciples,<p>Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to every creature. (<a href="3927/mark_16_15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>)<p>This, too, is the everlasting good news or gospel that "the angel flying in the midst of heaven" had "to proclaim to the those who dwell on the earth" (<a href="3927/revelation_14_6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>).</p><p>[6] Our being told that the mystery of God would be concluded means that something would be fulfilled that was not fulfilled before, namely, the coming of the Lord's kingdom. It was not fulfilled by the Jews because they did not acknowledge the Lord. Neither has it been fulfilled by Christians because they do not acknowledge the Lord to be God of heaven and earth even in respect to His human element; for they regard this as being like anyone else's human element. Consequently they do not turn to Him directly, even though He is Jehovah who came into the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 478</h4><p>478. 'And the mystery of God shall be accomplished, as He has declared (evangelizare) to His servants the prophets' signifies that it is going to become apparent that it has been foretold in the Word of both Testaments, and has been concealed up to this time, that after a last judgment upon those who have devastated the Church the Lord's kingdom is going to come. By 'to be accomplished' is signified to be fulfilled, to have an end, and then to appear; by 'the mystery of God declared to the prophets' is signified what has been foretold by the Lord in the Word and concealed up to this time; by 'to declare (evangelizare)' is signified to announce the Lord's coming and His kingdom, for the Gospel (evangelium) is a joyful messenger. That this is going to come about after a last judgment has been effected upon those who have devastated the Church, has been foretold in the Word, and therefore this also is signified. From these considerations it can he established that all these things are understood by these words.</p><p>[2] Here first something shall be said about what is foretold of the Lord's coming and His kingdom in the Word of both Testaments. In the Word of the Old Testament that is called prophetical, in its spiritual sense and also where that sense shines forth in the natural sense, it treats of the Only Lord; plainly of His coming in the fullness of time, which is when the good of charity and the truth of faith would be no longer in the Church, which state thereof is called consummation, devastation desolation and decision. Again it treats of His combats with the hells and victories over them, which indeed are the last judgment effected by Him; and after these things, of the creation of the New Heaven and the setting up of the New Church, and these are the Lord's kingdom about to come. It also treats of these things in the Word of the New Testament that is called apostolic, and in a special manner in the Apocalypse.</p><p>[3] That it is the Lord's kingdom that will be declared 'in the days of the voice of the seventh angel' is plain in the following chapter <a href="3927/revelation_11_1.htm">11</a> from these words:<p>And the seventh angel sounded, and great voices were produced in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world have become our Lord's and His Christ's, and He shall reign for ages of ages: and the twenty-four elders fell upon their faces and adored God, saying. We give Thee thanks, O Lord God, Who art and Who wast and Who art to come, that Thou hast attained Thy great power, and taken over the kingdom (verses 15-17).</p><p>[4] This mystery is described in Daniel, almost in the same manner as here in the Apocalypse, where these words are:<p>I heard the man clothed in linen, and he lifted up his hands unto heaven, and swore by the One living for ages of ages, that [it should be] unto the appointed time of the appointed times and a half, when all these things must be finished: but he said, Go, Daniel, because the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end. <a href="3927/daniel_12_7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_12_9.htm">9</a>.<p>'Until the time of the end' is up till this time. That the Son of Man is then going to take the kingdom, he foretells with these words:<p>I was seeing in night visions, and behold with the clouds of heaven there was coming One like the Son of Man, and to Him was given dominion, and glory, and the kingdom: and all peoples, nations and tongues shall worship Him. His dominion is the dominion of the age that shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not perish. <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>.</p><p>[5] That 'to declare good tidings (evangelizare)' signifies the Lord's coming and His kingdom at that time is plain from these passages:<p>Get thee up upon the mountain, O Zion declaring good tidings (Evangelizatrix); lift up thy voice with excellence, O Jerusalem declaring good tidings (Evangelizatrix); say, Behold your God, behold the Lord Jehovih is coming in strength, and His arm shall have dominion for Him. <a href="3927/isaiah_40_9.htm">Isaiah 40:9-11</a>.<p>How delightful upon the mountains are the feet of one declaring good tidings, making [us] to hear peace, declaring good tidings of good, making [us] to hear salvation, saying unto Zion, Thy King <sup>1</sup>shall reign. <a href="3927/isaiah_52_7.htm">Isaiah 52:7-8</a>; <a href="3927/nahum_1_15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a> [H.B <a href="3927/nahum_2_1.htm">2:1</a>].<p>Sing unto Jehovah, bless in His Name, declare the good tidings of His salvation from day to day, for Jehovah is coming. <a href="3927/psalms_96_2.htm">Psalms 96:2</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_96_13.htm">13</a>.<p>The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon Me, therefore has Jehovah anointed Me to declare good tidings to the poor, to preach liberty to the captives, to proclaim the year of the good pleasure of Jehovah. <a href="3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>.<p>The angel [said] to Zechariah, Behold, thy wife shall bring forth a son, who shall go before in the presence of the Lord God in the spirit and vigour (virtus) of Elijah, and to prepare the people for the Lord. I am Gabriel, and have been sent to declare (evangelizare) this to thee. <a href="3927/luke_1_13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_19.htm">19</a>.<p>The angel said to the shepherds, Do not he afraid, behold, I declare unto you good tidings of great joy, because the Saviour has been born for you this day, who is Christ the Lord, in the city of David. <a href="3927/luke_2_10.htm">Luke 2:10-11</a>.<p>That the Lord declared good tidings of the kingdom of God [may be seen]. <a href="3927/matthew_4_23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_9_35.htm">9:35</a>; Mark 15; <a href="3927/luke_7_22.htm">Luke 7:22</a>; <a href="3927/luke_8_1.htm">8:1</a>; <a href="3927/luke_9_1.htm">9:1-2</a>.<p>That John the Baptist [did so]. <a href="3927/luke_3_18.htm">Luke 3:18</a>. Jesus also said to the disciples, Going into the whole world, preach the Gospel (Evangelium) to every creature, <a href="3927/mark_16_15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>.<p>This also is the 'eternal Gospel' that 'the angel flying in the midst of heaven' had for declaring 'unto those dwelling upon the land' (<a href="3927/revelation_14_6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>).</p><p>[6] It is said that 'the mystery of God shall be accomplished,' by which is understood that now will be fulfilled what has not been fulfilled before, that is, that the kingdom is going to be the Lord's. For it has not been fulfilled by the Jews, because they have not acknowledged the Lord; nor has it been fulfilled by the Christians, for neither do they acknowledge the Lord as the God of heaven and earth as so the Human also, for they make this like the human of another man, and therefore they do not approach Him directly, when yet it is Jehovah Who has come into the world.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;So also <a href="../ae/365.htm">Apocalypse Explained 365</a>[30] and other places; but Hebrew has 'God. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 478</h4><p>478. The mystery of God shall be finished; as He hath declared to His servants the prophets, signifies that then it will appear that it is foretold in the Word of both Testaments, but has hitherto been hidden, that after the Last Judgment is executed upon those who have devastated the church, the Lord's kingdom will come. By "being finished" is signified to be fulfilled, to have an end, and then to appear. By "the mystery of God declared to the prophets," is signified that which is foretold by the Lord in the Word, and hitherto hidden. By "declaring" (evangelizing) is signified to announce the Lord's advent and His kingdom, for the Gospel is a glad messenger. That this will come to pass, after the Last Judgment is executed upon those who have devastated the church, is also foretold in the Word, therefore this also is signified. From this it may appear, that all these are meant by these words.</p><p>[2] Something shall first be said of what is foretold in the Word of both Testaments, concerning the coming of the Lord, and His kingdom. In the Word of the Old Testament, which is called prophetic, in the spiritual sense, and also where this sense shines forth, in the natural sense, the Lord alone is treated of, that is to say, His advent in the fullness of time; which is, when there is no longer any good of charity and truth of faith in the church, which state of the church is called the consummation, devastation, desolation, and decision. It also treats of His combats with the hells and victories over them, which likewise constitute the Last Judgment executed by Him; and afterwards of the creation of a new heaven, and the establishment of a new church, which are the Lord's kingdom that is to come. These things are also treated of in the Word of the New Testament, which is called apostolic, and particularly in Revelation.</p><p>[3] That it is the Lord's kingdom, that "will be declared in the days of the voice of the seventh angel," appears plainly in the next or eleventh chapter from these things:<p>And the seventh angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world have become our Lord's and His Christ's, and He shall reign for ages of ages; and the twenty-four elders fell upon their faces, and adored God, saying, We give Thee thanks, O Lord God, who art and who wast and who art to come, that Thou hast taken to Thee Thy great power, and hast entered into the kingdom, (<a href="3927/revelation_11_15.htm">Rev 11:15-17</a>).</p><p>[4] This mystery is described in Daniel almost in the same manner as here in Revelation, where are these words:<p>I heard the man clothed in linen, that he lifted up his hands to heaven, and swore by Him that liveth forever, that it should be unto the stated time of stated times and a half, when all these things should be finished: but he said, Go, Daniel, because the words are shut up and sealed even to the time of the end, (<a href="3927/daniel_12_7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_12_9.htm">9</a>).<p>"Even to the time of the end" is even to this time. That then the Son of man will take the kingdom He foretells in these words:<p>I saw in the vision of the night, and behold, there was one like the Son of man coming with the clouds of heaven; and to Him was given dominion, and glory, and a kingdom; and all peoples, nations, and tongues shall worship Him. His dominion is the dominion of an age which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not perish, (<a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>).</p><p>[5] That "to declare good tidings" [evangelize] signifies the Lord's coming and His kingdom at that time is manifest from these passages:<p>O Zion, that declarest good tidings, get thee up upon the mountain: O Jerusalem, that declarest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; say, Behold your God; behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength, and His arm shall rule for Him, (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_9.htm">Isaiah 40:9-10</a>).<p>How delightful upon the mountains are the feet of him that declareth good tidings, that maketh us to hear peace, that declareth good tidings of good, that maketh us to hear salvation, that saith to Zion, thy God shall reign, (<a href="3927/isaiah_52_7.htm">Isaiah 52:7-8</a>; <a href="3927/nahum_1_15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>).<p>Sing unto Jehovah, bless His name, declare the good tidings of His salvation from day to day; for Jehovah cometh, (<a href="3927/psalms_96_2.htm">Psalms 96:2</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_96_13.htm">13</a>).<p>The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon me, therefore Jehovah hath anointed me to declare good tidings to the poor, to preach liberty to the captives, to proclaim the year of the good pleasure of Jehovah, (<a href="3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>).<p>The angel said to Zechariah, Behold, thy wife shall bring forth a son, who shall go forth before the Lord God in the spirit and power of Elias, and to prepare the people for the Lord. I am Gabriel, and I was sent to declare to thee this good tidings, (<a href="3927/luke_1_13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_19.htm">19</a>).<p>The angel said to the shepherds, Fear not; behold, I declare to you good tidings of great joy; for unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior who is Christ the Lord, (<a href="3927/luke_2_10.htm">Luke 2:10-11</a>).<p>The Lord declared the glad tidings of the kingdom of God, (<a href="3927/matthew_4_23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_9_35.htm">9:35</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>; <a href="3927/luke_7_22.htm">Luke 7:22</a>; <a href="3927/luke_8_1.htm">8:1</a>; <a href="3927/luke_9_1.htm">9:1-2</a>).<p>John the Baptist also, (<a href="3927/luke_3_18.htm">Luke 3:18</a>).<p>Jesus also said to the disciples, Go into all the world, preach the gospel to every creature, (<a href="3927/mark_16_15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>).<p>This also is "the everlasting gospel" which the angel had that was flying in the midst of heaven, "to declare to them that dwell upon the earth" (<a href="3927/revelation_14_6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>).</p><p>[6] It is said that "the mystery of God shall be finished;" by which is meant that now will be fulfilled that which has not been fulfilled before, which is that the kingdom will be the Lord's. For it was not fulfilled by the Jews, because they did not acknowledge the Lord. Nor was it fulfilled by the Christians, for neither did they acknowledge the Lord as the God of heaven and earth even as to His Human; for they make this like the human of another man: wherefore they do not go immediately to Him; when yet He is Jehovah, who came into the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 478 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>478. "Et consummabitur mysterium Dei, sicut evangelizavit Suis servis Prophetis," significat quod tunc appariturum sit quod in Verbo utriusque Testamenti praedictum est et hactenus occultatum, quod post Ultimum Judicium super illos qui devastaverunt Ecclesiam, venturum sit Regnum Domini. - Per "consummari significatur impleri, finem habere, et tunc apparere; per "mysterium Dei evangelizatum prophetis" significatur id quod a Domino praedictum est in Verbo et hactenus occultatum; per "evangelizare" significatur annuntiare Adventum Domini et Regnum Ipsius, "Evangelium" enim est laetus nuntius; quod hoc exstiturum sit, postquam Ultimum Judicium super illos qui devastaverunt Ecclesiam factum est, etiam in Verbo praedictum est, quale hoc quoque significatur. Ex his constare potest, quod haec omnia per illa verba intelligantur. <p>Hic primum aliquid de praedictione Adventus Domini et Regni Ipsius in Verbo utriusque Testamenti, dicetur. In Verbo Veteris Testamenti, quod Propheticum vocatur, in Sensu ejus spirituali, et quoque, ubi ille Sensus elucet, in Sensu naturali, agitur de Solo Domino, videlicet de Adventu Ipsius in plenitudine temporum, quae est, quando non amplius bonum charitatis et verum fidei in Ecclesia esset, qui status ejus vocatur consummatio, devastatio, desolatio, et decisio; tum de Pugnis Ipsius cum Infernis ac de Victoriis super illa, quae etiam sunt Ultimum Judicium ab Ipso factum; et post haec, de Creatione Novi Caeli et de Instauratione Novae Ecclesiae, quae sunt Regnum Domini venturum; de his quoque agitur in Verbo Novi Testamenti, quod Apostolicum vocatur, et in Specie in Apocalypsi. Quod sit Regnum Domini, quod in "diebus vocis Septimi Angeli evangelizabitur," patet in capite sequente (xi.), ex his: <p>"Et septimus Angelus clanxit, et factae sunt voces magnae in Caelo, dicentes, Facta sunt Regna mundi Domini nostri et Christi Ipsius, et regnabit in saecula saeculorum: et viginti quatuor Seniores ceciderunt super facies suas, et adoraverunt Deum, dicentes. Gratias agimus Tibi Domine Deus, Qui Es et Qui Eras et Qui Venturus, quod adeptus sis potentiam Tuam magnam, et Regnum inieris," (vers. 15-17).<p>Hoc mysterium paene similiter ut hic in Apocalypsi, describitur apud Danielem, ubi haec: <p>"Audivi virum indutum linteis, quod sustulerit manus suas ad Caelum, et juraverit per Viventem in aeternum, quod ad tempus statum temporum statorum et dimidium," quum consummanda sunt omnia haec: verum dixit, "Abi Daniel, quia occlusa et obsignata verba usque ad tempus finis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_478/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_12_7" target=_top>12:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_478/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_12_9" target=_top>9</a>);<p>"usque ad tempus finis" est usque ad hoc tempus. Quod tunc Filius Hominis accepturus sit Regnum, praedicit his verbis: <p>"Videns fui in Visionibus noctis, et ecce cum nubibus caelorum, sicut Filius Hominis, veniens fuit; et Huic datum est Dominium, et Gloria, et Regnum, et omnes populi, gentes et linguae Ipsum colent; Dominium Ipsius Dominium saeculi quod non transibit, et Regnum Ipsius quod non peribit," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_478/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_7_13-14" target=_top>Daniel 7:13-14</a>).<p>Quod "evangelizare" significet Adventum Domini, et tunc Regnum Ipsius, patet ex his locis: <p>"Super Montem ascende tibi, Evangelizatrix Sion: extolle cum virtute vocem tuam, Evangelizatrix Hierosolyma; dic, Ecce Deus vester: ecce Dominus Jehovih in forti venit, et brachium Ipsius dominabitur Ipsi," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_478/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_40_9-10" target=_top>Esaias 40:9-10</a>);
