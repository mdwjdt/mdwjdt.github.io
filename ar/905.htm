<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第905节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>905.启21:16.“城是四方的”表它里面的公正。这城之所以看上去是“四方的”，是因为“四方”或“正方形”表示公正，而“三角形”表示公平，所有这些都是终端层面，或属世层面的。“四方”或“正方形”表示公正，是因为它有四边，而四边正对着四方，同等地对着四方就是出于公正尊重一切事物；因此，每个方向都有进城的三个门开着，在以赛亚书，经上说：</p><p>你敞开城门，使守信的公义民族得以进入。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛26.2.htm">26:2</a>）</p><p>“城是四方的”，意味着长与宽是同等的，“长”表示新教会的良善，“宽”表示新教会的真理，当良善与真理同等时，就会有公正。正是由于“正方形”具有这种含义，所以在日常用语中，人们会说某人很“方正”，是那种不会出于不公正而偏向这一方或那一方的人。“四方”表示公正，故表示出于良善、因而出于属天真理的敬拜的燔祭坛就是“四方的”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.1.htm">27:1</a>）；表示出于良善、因而出于属灵真理的敬拜的香坛也是四方的（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.1.htm">30:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.2.htm">2</a>）；表示含有乌陵和土明的决断胸牌同样“四方的，叠为两层”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.15.htm">28:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.16.htm">16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.9.htm">39:9</a>）；此外还有其它经文。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 905</h4><p>905. <a href="3927/revelation_21_16.htm">21:16</a> The city is laid out as a square. This symbolizes justice in the New Church.<p>The city was seen as square because a square or quadrilateral form symbolizes justice, inasmuch as a triangle symbolizes rectitude, all of these being symbols on the lowest level, which is the natural one.<p>A square or quadrilateral layout symbolizes justice because it has four sides, and the four sides face the four cardinal points of the compass; and to face the four cardinal points equally is to regard everything equitably. That is why there were three gates on each side giving entrance into the city, and why it is said in Isaiah,<p>Open the gates, that a righteous nation which keeps its fealties may enter in. (<a href="3927/isaiah_26_2.htm">Isaiah 26:2</a>)<p>The city was laid out as a square in order that its length and breadth might be equal, the length symbolizing the goodness of the New Church, and the breadth its truth, and when goodness and truth are in balance, then there is justice.<p>It is because a square has this symbolic meaning that we say in everyday speech that this or that man deals squarely, meaning a man who does not incline unjustly to either one party or the other.<p>Because a square symbolizes justice, therefore the altar of burnt offering was square (<a href="3927/exodus_27_1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>), which symbolized a worship springing from a celestial goodness and consequent truth. The altar of incense, too, was square as well (<a href="3927/exodus_30_1.htm">Exodus 30:1-2</a>). And other objects also were square. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 905</h4><p>905. [verse 16] 'And the city lies foursquare' signifies justice in that [Church]. The reason why the city was seen 'foursquare' is because 'a quadrangle' or 'a square' signifies what is just, for 'a triangle' signifies what is right, all these in the ultimate degree, which is the natural. 'A quadrangle' or 'a square' signifies what is just because it has four sides, and the four sides look to the four quarters, and to look equally to the four quarters is to regard all things from what is just; for which reason there were three gates opening into the city from each quarter, and it is said in Isaiah:<p>Open up the gates, that the just nation keeping fidelities may enter in <a href="3927/isaiah_26_2.htm">Isaiah 26:2</a>.<p>The city lay foursquare, so that its length and breadth were equal, and by 'length' is signified the good of that city, and by 'breadth' its truth, and when good and truth are equal then there is what is just. It is from this signification of 'a square' that in common parlance one is termed a 'square man,' who does not deviate to one side or another from an unjust motive. Because 'square' signifies what is just, therefore 'the altar of burnt-offering,' by which was signified worship derived from good and heavenly truth therefrom, was 'square' (<a href="3927/exodus_27_1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>). Again, 'the altar of incense,' by which was signified worship derived from good and thence from spiritual truth, also was 'square' (<a href="3927/exodus_30_1.htm">Exodus 30:1-2</a>). So also 'the breastplate of judgment,' in which was the Urim and Thummim, was a 'doubled square' (<a href="3927/exodus_28_15.htm">Exodus 28:15-16</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_39_9.htm">39:9</a>); besides other instances. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 905</h4><p>905. Verse 16. And the city lieth foursquare, signifies justice in it. The reason why the city was seen "foursquare" is because "a quadrangle" or "a square" signifies what is just, for "a triangle" signifies what is right, all these in the ultimate degree, or the natural. "A quadrangle" or "a square" signifies what is just because it has four sides, and the four sides look towards the four quarters, and to look equally towards the four quarters, is to respect all things from justice; for which reason three gates opened into the city from each quarter, and it is said in Isaiah:<p>Open ye the gates, that a just nation which keepeth faithfulness may enter in, (<a href="3927/isaiah_26_2.htm">Isaiah 26:2</a>).<p>"The city lieth foursquare" that the length and breadth thereof might be equal, and by "length" is signified the good of that church, and by "breadth" its truth, and when good and truth are equal, then there is what is just. It is owing to this signification of "a square," that in common discourse a man is said to be "square," who is a man that does not from injustice incline either to this or that party. Because "foursquare" signifies what is just, therefore, the altar of burnt-offering, by which was signified worship from good and thence from celestial truth, was "foursquare" (<a href="3927/exodus_27_1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>); also the altar of incense, by which was signified worship from good and thence from spiritual truth, was likewise "foursquare" (<a href="3927/exodus_30_1.htm">Exodus 30:1-2</a>). And also, the breastplate of judgment, in which was the Urim and Thummim, was "foursquare" doubled, (<a href="3927/exodus_28_15.htm">Exodus 28:15-16</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_39_9.htm">39:9</a>); besides other passages. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 905 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>905. (Vers. 16.) "Et urbs quadrangularis sita est," significat justitiam in illa. -Quod urbs visa sit "quadrangularis," est quia "quadrangulare" seu "quadratum" significat justum; nam "triangulare" significat rectum: omnia illa in ultimo gradu, qui est naturalis. "Quadrangulare" seu "quadratum" significat justum, quia sunt ei quatuor latera, et quatuor latera spectant quatuor plagas; et aequaliter spectare quatuor plagas, est ex justo omnia: quare tres portae ab unaquavis plaga patebant in urbem; et dicitur apud Esajam, <p>"Aperite portas, ut ingrediatur Gens justa custodiens fidelitates," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_905/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_26_2" target=_top>26:2</a>). <sup>1</sup><p>"Urbs quadrangularis sita est," ut longitudo et latitudo ejus essent aequales; et per "longitudinem" significatur bonum illius Ecclesiae, et per "latitudinem" verum ejus; et quando bonum et verum aequalia sunt, tunc est justum. Ex hac significatione "quadrati" est, quod in communi sermone dicatur vir "quadratus," qui est vir qui non ad hanc vel ad illam partem declinat ex injusto. Quia "quadratum" significat justum, ideo Altare holocausti (per quod significabatur cultus ex bono et inde vero caelesti) erat quadratum, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_905/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_27_1" target=_top>Exodus 27:1</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>Tum Altare suffitus (per quod significabatur cultus ex bono et inde vero spirituali) etiam erat quadratum, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_905/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_30_1-2" target=_top>Exodus 30:1-2</a>); <sup>3</sup><p>Et quoque Pectorale judicii, in quo erat Urim et Thummim, erat quadratum duplicatum, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_905/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_28_15" target=_top>Exodus 28:15</a>(, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_905/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_28_16" target=_top>16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_905/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_39_9" target=_top>39:9</a>)).<p>(Praeter alia.) <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;2 pro "3"<br>2.&nbsp;xxvii. pro "xxviii."<p>3.&nbsp;30:1, 2 pro "30:1, 2; 39:9" </p>
