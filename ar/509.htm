<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第509节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>509.“因这两位先知曾叫住在地上的人受痛苦”表新教会的这两大基本要素，一个涉及主和神性人，另一个涉及遵行十诫的生活，因与改革宗教会所接受的两大基本要素，一个涉及三位格的三一体，另一个涉及唯信得救，无需律法行为，截然对立，并且由于这种对立而遭到蔑视、反感和厌恶。这就是所表示的，当“两位先知”或“两个见证人”表示新教会的两大基本要素，并且“住在地上的人”表示那些陷入改革宗教会的两大基本要素之人时，这一点是随之而来的必然结果；“受痛苦”表示遭到蔑视、反感和厌恶。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 509</h4><p>509. Because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth. This symbolically means that these two essential elements of the New Church, one having to do with the Lord and His Divine humanity, and the other teaching a life in accordance with the Ten Commandments, are opposed to the two essential elements accepted in the Protestant Reformed Church, one teaching a trinity of persons, and the other teaching faith alone as saving apart from works of the law; and because of that opposition the two essential elements of the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, are objects of contempt, distress, and repugnance.<p>Seeing that the two prophets or witnesses mean these two essential elements of the New Church, and that those who dwell on the earth mean people caught up in these two essential teachings of the Protestant Reformed Church, this symbolic meaning follows as a self-evident conclusion. To torment means, symbolically, to be an object of contempt, distress and repugnance. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 509</h4><p>509. 'Because those two prophets tormented those dwelling upon the land' signifies that these two Essentials, the one concerning the Lord and the Divine Human and the other concerning a life in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue, are in complete contrast to the two Essentials received in the Church of the Reformed, one of which is concerning a Trinity of Persons and the other concerning salvation by faith alone apart from the works of the law, and that by reason of this complete contrast these two Essentials of the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, are held in contempt, dislike and aversion. That these things are signified when by the 'two prophets' or witnesses these two Essentials of the New Church are understood, and when by 'those dwelling upon the land' are understood those who are in the two Essentials of the Church of the Reformed, follows of itself as a conclusion. By 'to torment' is signified to be held in contempt, dislike and aversion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 509</h4><p>509. Because these two prophets tormented them that dwell upon the earth, signifies that these two essentials, one concerning the Lord and concerning the Divine Human; and the other concerning a life according to the commandments of the Decalogue, are contrary to the two essentials received in the church of the Reformed, one of which relates to a Trinity of Persons, and the other to faith alone being saving without the works of the law, and that by reason of this contrariety, those two essentials of the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, are held in contempt, dislike, and aversion. That this is what is signified, when by "the two prophets" or "witnesses" are meant the two essentials of the New Church, and when by "them that dwell upon the earth" are meant they who are in the two essentials of the church of the Reformed, follows as a necessary consequence; by "tormenting" is signified to be held in contempt, dislike, and aversion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 509 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>509. "Quia illi duo prophetae cruciaverunt habitantes super terra," significat quod duo illa Essentialia, unum de Domino et de Divino Humano, et alterum de Vita secundum praecepta Decalogi, contrarientur binis Essentialibus in Ecclesia Reformatorum receptis, quorum unum est de Trinitate Personarum, et alterum de sola Fide salvante absque operibus legis; et quod ex contrarietate illa, bina illa Essentialia Novae Ecclesiae, quae est Nova Hierosolyma, sint contemptui, molestiae et aversationi. - Quod haec significentur, dum per "duos prophetas," seu "teste," intelliguntur bina illa Essentialia Novae Ecclesiae, et cum per "habitantes super terra" intelliguntur illi qui in duobus illis Essentialibus Ecclesiae Reformatorum sunt, ex se ut conclusum sequitur; per "cruciare" significatur esse contemptui, molestiae et aversationi. </p>
