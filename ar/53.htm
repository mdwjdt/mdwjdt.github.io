<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第53节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>53.“祂的脸面像日头满有力地发光”表神性之爱和神性智慧，它们就是祂自己并从祂发出。“耶和华的脸面”，或主的脸面表示在自己本质中的神性本身，这神性本身就是神性的爱和智慧，因而是祂自己。这一点可见于下面提及“神的脸面”之处的解读。这一点同样由“满有力地发光的日头”来表示。主在天堂看似一轮太阳（或日头），祂的神性之爱和神性智慧便以这种方式显现。这一点可见于1758年伦敦出版的《天堂与地狱》（<a href="../hh/116.htm">116</a>-225节），以及《圣爱与圣智》（<a href="../dlw/83.htm">83</a>-107节）。</p><p>此处仅通过圣言证实，“日头”（或太阳）在论及主的时候，是指祂的神性之爱，同时也是指祂的神性智慧。这一点以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>当那日，月光必像日光，日光必加七倍，像七日的光一样。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.26.htm">30:26</a>）</p><p>“那日”是指主的降临，这时旧教会毁灭，新教会即将得以建立；“月光”是指源于仁之信，“日光”是指源于爱、因而源于主的聪明和智慧。</p><p>你的日头不再下落，你的月亮也不退缩；因为耶和华必作永远的光。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.20.htm">60:20</a>）</p><p>“不再下落”的日头是指来自主的爱与智慧。</p><p>以色列的磐石晓谕我说，好像日出时的晨光。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下23.3.htm">23:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下23.4.htm">4</a>）</p><p>“以色列的磐石”是指主。</p><p>祂宝座如太阳。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.36.htm">89:36</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.37.htm">37</a>）</p><p>这话是说大卫，但“大卫”在此处表示主。</p><p>他们必因太阳敬畏你。在祂的日子，义人要发旺，大有平安，直到月亮消逝；圣子的名必在太阳面前；列族必因祂蒙福。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.5.htm">72:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.17.htm">17</a>）</p><p>这也是指着主说的。由于主在天堂显为一轮太阳，故经上说：</p><p>当耶稣变像时，祂的脸面发光如日头，衣裳洁白如光。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.1.htm">17:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>经上论到从天而降的大力天使说：</p><p>祂披着云彩，脸面像日头。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启10.1.htm">10:1</a>）</p><p>论到那妇人说：</p><p>只见她身披日头。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.1.htm">12:1</a>）</p><p>在这些经文中，“日头”也表示来自主的爱与智慧；“妇人”是指教会，该教会被称为“新耶路撒冷”。</p><p>由于“日头”表示主的爱与智慧，故明显可知以下经文中的“日头”是什么意思：</p><p>看哪，耶和华的日子临到，必有残忍；日头一出，就变黑暗；月亮也不放光；我必因邪恶刑罚世界，因罪孽刑罚恶人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.9.htm">13:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.11.htm">11</a>；也可参看以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.21.htm">24:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.23.htm">23</a>）</p><p>我将你扑灭的时候，要把诸天遮蔽、使众星昏暗；我要以密云遮掩太阳，月亮也不放光，我要以黑暗遮蔽这地。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.7.htm">32:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.8.htm">8</a>）</p><p>耶和华的日子来到，那日是黑暗，日月不放光，星宿收回其光辉。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.10.htm">2:10</a>）</p><p>日头要变为黑暗，月亮要变为血，这都在耶和华大日未到以前。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.31.htm">2:31</a>）</p><p>耶和华的日子临近断定谷。日月昏暗。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.14.htm">3:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.15.htm">15</a>）</p><p>第四位天使吹号，日头的三分之一，月亮的三分之一，星辰的三分之一都被击打，白昼的三分之一没有光。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.12.htm">8:12</a>）</p><p>日头变黑像毛布，月亮变得像血。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.12.htm">6:12</a>）</p><p>日头因坑里的烟昏暗了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.2.htm">9:2</a>）</p><p>在这些经文中，“日头”不是指这个世界的太阳，而是指天使天堂的太阳，这太阳就是主的神性之爱和神性智慧；当人被邪恶和虚假蒙蔽时，经上便说这些“昏暗了”、“黑暗了”、“被遮蔽了”、“变黑了”。</p><p>因此很明显，主在论及时代的末了，就是教会的末期时所说的话也表示这些事：</p><p>那些日子的灾难一过去，日头就变黑了，月亮也不放光，众星要从天上坠落。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.29.htm">24:29</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.24.htm">13:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.25.htm">25</a>）</p><p>以下经文也是这样：</p><p>日头必向先知沉落，白昼向他们变为黑暗。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥3.5.htm">3:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥3.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>到那日，我必使日头在午间落下，使地在白昼黑暗。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩8.9.htm">8:9</a>）</p><p>生产七次的妇人灵魂气绝；尚在白昼，她的日头就落了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶15.9.htm">15:9</a>）</p><p>这说的是犹太教会，它的灵魂“气绝”，也就是即将灭亡；“日头落了”表示不再有丝毫爱与仁。</p><p>经上在约书亚记中说：</p><p>日头停在基遍，月亮止在亚雅仑谷。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书10.12.htm">10:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书10.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>这看起来像历史，其实是预言，引自先知书《雅煞珥书》，因为经上说：</p><p>这事岂不是写在雅煞珥书上吗？（约书亚记13）</p><p>大卫也曾提到这卷书，以之为预言书（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.17.htm">1:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.18.htm">18</a>）；类似的事在哈巴谷书中提到：</p><p>诸山颤抖，日月都停在原处。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.10.htm">3:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.11.htm">11</a>）</p><p>你的日头不再下落，你的月亮也不退缩。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.20.htm">60:20</a>）</p><p>真使日月停住无异于毁灭宇宙。</p><p>正因“日头”表主的神性之爱和神性智慧，所以古人举行神圣敬拜时面朝日出之地，其圣殿也朝向日出之地，该风俗流传至今。在上述经文中，“日头”不是这个世界的太阳，这一点从拜救尘世的日月被认为是污秽可憎的明显看出来（可参看民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.1.htm">25:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.4.htm">4</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.19.htm">4:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.3.htm">17:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.5.htm">5</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.1.htm">8:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.2.htm">2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶43.10.htm">43:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶43.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶44.17.htm">44:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶44.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶44.25.htm">25</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.16.htm">8:16</a>）。“尘世的日头”表自我之爱和对人自己才华的骄傲；自我之爱与神性之爱截然对立，对人自己才华的骄傲与神性智慧截然对立。拜尘世的太阳也就是承认自然界为创造者，认为人自己的精明是那产生万事万物的，否认圣治（或天命Divine providence）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 53</h4><p>53. And His countenance as the sun shining in its power. This symbolizes the Divine love and wisdom which are the Lord and which emanate from Him.<p>The fact that the face of Jehovah or of the Lord means the Divine itself in its essence, which is Divine love and wisdom, thus Himself, will be seen in explanations below where the face of God is mentioned. "The sun shining in its power" has the same symbolic meaning.<p>In the sight of angels the Lord is seen as the sun in heaven, and it is His Divine love accompanied by Divine wisdom that so appears. This may be seen in the book Heaven and Hell (London, 1758), nos. <a href="../hh/116.htm">116-125</a> and in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom, <a href="../dlw/83.htm">83-172</a>.</p><p>[2] It remains here simply to confirm from the Word that when the subject is the Lord, the sun is His Divine love and at the same time His Divine wisdom. This can be seen from the following passages:<p>...in (that) day... the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, as the light of seven days... (<a href="3927/isaiah_30_25.htm">Isaiah 30:25-26</a>)<p>That day is the Lord's advent, when the old church has been destroyed and a new one is about to be established. The light of the moon is faith arising from charity, and the light of the sun is intelligence and wisdom arising from love emanating then from the Lord.<p>Your sun shall no longer go down, nor shall your moon wane; for Jehovah will be your everlasting light... (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_20.htm">Isaiah 60:20</a>)<p>The sun that will not go down is love and wisdom from the Lord.<p>...the Rock of Israel spoke to me... like the light of the morning when the sun rises... (<a href="3927/2-samuel_23_3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3-4</a>)<p>The Rock of Israel is the Lord.<p>...his throne (shall be) as the sun... (<a href="3927/psalms_89_36.htm">Psalms 89:36-37</a>)<p>This is said in reference to David, but David there means the Lord.<p>They shall fear You as long as the sun endures... In His days the righteous shall flourish, and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more... Before the sun He will have the name of Son, and all nations shall be blessed in Him... (<a href="3927/psalms_72_5.htm">Psalms 72:5</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_72_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_72_17.htm">17</a>)<p>These statements, too, are made in reference to the Lord.</p><p>[3] Because the Lord appears in heaven to angels as the sun, therefore when He was transfigured,<p>His face shone like the sun, and His garments became... as the light. (<a href="3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17:1-2</a>)<p>Moreover, in <a href="3927/revelation_10_1.htm">Revelation 10:1</a> it is said of the mighty angel coming down from heaven that he was "clothed with a cloud," and "his face was like the sun," and of the woman in <a href="3927/revelation_12_1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a> that she appeared "clothed with the sun." The sun there is love and wisdom emanating from the Lord. The woman there is the church called the New Jerusalem.</p><p>[4] Since the sun means the Lord with respect to love and wisdom, it is apparent what the sun symbolizes in the following places:<p>Behold, the day of Jehovah is coming, cruel... The sun will be darkened at its rising, and the moon will not cause its light to shine. I will visit upon the world its wickedness, and upon the impious their iniquity. (<a href="3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">Isaiah 13:9-11</a>)<p>...Jehovah will visit [punishment] in the high place upon the host of the high place, and on the earth upon the kings of the earth... Then the moon will blush and the sun be ashamed. (<a href="3927/isaiah_24_21.htm">Isaiah 24:21</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_24_23.htm">23</a>)<p>When I put out your light, I will cover the heavens, and make their stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not cause its light to shine... and I will... bring darkness upon your land. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_32_7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7-8</a>)<p>...the day of Jehovah is coming..., a day of darkness... The sun and moon (will not cause their light to shine), and the stars have diminished their brightness. (<a href="3927/joel_2_1.htm">Joel 2:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/joel_2_10.htm">10</a>)<p>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great... day of Jehovah. (<a href="3927/joel_2_31.htm">Joel 2:31</a>)<p>...the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision. The sun and moon have grown dark... (<a href="3927/joel_3_14.htm">Joel 3:14-15</a>)<p>The fourth angel sounded: and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars..., and a third of the day did not shine... (<a href="3927/revelation_8_12.htm">Revelation 8:12</a>)<p>...the sun became as black as sackcloth of goat's hair, and the moon became as blood... (<a href="3927/revelation_6_12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>)<p>...the sun was... darkened because of the smoke of the pit. (<a href="3927/revelation_9_2.htm">Revelation 9:2</a>)<p>The sun in these places does not mean the world's sun, but the sun of the angelic heaven, which is the Lord's Divine love and wisdom. These are said to be obscured, darkened, covered, or become black when falsities and evils are present in a person.</p><p>[5] It is apparent, therefore, that something similar is meant by the Lord's words when speaking of the end of the age, which is the final period of the church:<p>Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven... (<a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>, cf. <a href="3927/mark_13_24.htm">Mark 13:24-25</a>)<p>So, too, in the following places:<p>The sun shall go down on the prophets, and the day shall be dark for them. (<a href="3927/micah_3_6.htm">Micah 3:6</a>)<p>...in that day... I will make the sun go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in broad daylight. (<a href="3927/amos_8_9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>)<p>She... who has borne seven... will breath her last; her sun will go down while it is yet day. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_15_9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>)<p>The subject here is the Jewish Church, which will breathe its last or perish. The sun's going down means that there will no longer be any love or charity.</p><p>[6] It is said in Joshua that the sun stood still in Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Aijalon (<a href="3927/joshua_10_12.htm">Joshua 10:12-13</a>). This seems to be an historical statement, but in fact it is prophetic, for it comes from the book of Jasher, which was a prophetic book; for in verse 13 it says, "Is this not written in the Book of Jasher?" The same book is called a prophetic one by David in <a href="3927/2-samuel_1_17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17</a>, <a href="3927/2-samuel_1_18.htm">18</a>.<p>A similar statement is found in Habakkuk:<p>The mountains... were shaken... The sun and moon stood still in their habitation. (<a href="3927/habakkuk_3_10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10-11</a>)<p>[In Isaiah:]<p>Your sun shall no longer go down, nor shall your moon wane. (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_20.htm">Isaiah 60:20</a>)<p>For to cause the sun and moon to stand still would be to destroy the universe.</p><p>[7] Since the sun means the Lord with respect to Divine love and wisdom, therefore in their holy worship ancient peoples turned their faces to the rising sun, and their temples also, a practice that continues to this day.<p>That the sun in these passages does not mean the world's sun is clear from the fact that it was profane and an abomination for people to worship the world's sun and moon (see <a href="3927/numbers_25_1.htm">Numbers 25:1-4</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_4_19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_17_3.htm">17:3</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_17_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_8_1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1-2</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_43_10.htm">43:10</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_43_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_44_17.htm">44:17-19</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_44_25.htm">25</a>). For the world's sun means self-love and a conceit in one's own intelligence, and self-love is diametrically opposed to Divine love, while a conceit in one's own intelligence is opposed to Divine wisdom. To worship the world's sun is also to accept nature as the creator of all things and one's own prudence as the effecter of all things, which entails a denial of God and a denial of Divine providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 53</h4><p>53. 'And His face as the sun shining in its power' signifies the Divine Love and Wisdom, which are Himself, and proceed from Him. That by the 'face' of Jehovah or the Lord is understood the Divine Itself in Its Own Essence which is the Divine Love and Wisdom, thus Himself, will be seen below in the Expositions where 'the face of God' is mentioned. That in the presence of the angels the Lord is seen as the Sun in heaven, and that His Divine Love together with His Divine Wisdom appear in this manner, may be seen in the work concerning HEAVEN AND HELL, published at London, 1758 (<a href="../hh/116.htm">116-125</a>); and in <a href="../dlw/83.htm">ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM 83-172</a>.</p><p>[2] Here it remains only to be confirmed out of the Word that 'the Sun,' when [said] of the Lord, is His Divine Love and at the same time His Divine Wisdom. This can be established from the following passages:<p>In that day the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, it shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days. <a href="3927/isaiah_30_25.htm">Isaiah 30:25-26</a>.<p>'That day' is the Lord's coming, when the old Church has been destroyed, and a new one is going to be set up. 'The light of the moon' is faith derived from charity, and 'the light of the sun' is intelligence and wisdom derived from love at that time from the Lord.<p>Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon be withdrawn (colligetur), for Jehovah shall be for a light of eternity. <a href="3927/isaiah_60_20.htm">Isaiah 60:20</a>.<p>The sun that shall not set is love and wisdom from the Lord.<p>The Rock of Israel spoke unto me, as the light of the morning when the sun arises. <a href="3927/2-samuel_23_3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3-4</a>.<p>'The Rock of Israel' is the Lord.<p>His throne shall be as the sun. <a href="3927/psalms_89_36.htm">Psalms 89:36-37</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_89_37.htm">37-38</a>].<p>This is said of David, but by 'David' there is understood the Lord.<p>They shall fear thee along with the suit, and in His days shall the just flourish, and abundance of peace until there is no moon. He shall have the name of the Son in the presence of the sun, and all nations shall be blessed in Him. <a href="3927/psalms_72_5.htm">Psalms 72:5</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_72_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_72_17.htm">17</a>.</p><p>[3] These things also [are said] concerning the Lord. Because in heaven in the presence of the angels the Lord appears as the Sun, therefore:<p>When He was transformed, His face did shine as the sun, His garments became as the light. <a href="3927/matthew_17_1.htm">Matthew 17:1-2</a>.<p>Also it is said of the strong angel coming down out of heaven, that:<p>He was encompassed with a cloud, and his face as the sun. <a href="3927/revelation_10_1.htm">Revelation 10:1</a>.<p>Also of the woman, that: she was seen encompassed with the sun. <a href="3927/revelation_12_1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>.<p>There also 'the sun' is love and wisdom from the Lord; 'the woman' is the Church that is called New Jerusalem.</p><p>[4] Since by 'the sun' is understood the Lord as to Love and Wisdom, what is signified by 'the sun' is plain in the following passages:<p>Behold the day of Jehovah is coming fierce, the sun shall be darkened in its springing forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.

(verse 13).<p>The same book is also mentioned by David as a prophetical book (<a href="3927/2-samuel_1_17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-18</a>).

That by 'the sun' in these passages the sun of the world is not understood is established from the fact that it was profane and abominable to worship the sun and moon of the world; see, <a href="3927/numbers_25_1.htm">Numbers 25:1-4</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_4_19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_17_3.htm">17:3</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_17_5.htm">5</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_8_1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1-2</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_43_10.htm">43:10</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_43_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_44_17.htm">44:17-19</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_44_25.htm">25</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_8_16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>; for by 'the sun of the world' is understood the love of self and the pride of one's own intelligence. Moreover, the love of self is diametrically opposed to Divine Love, and the pride of one's own intelligence is opposed to Divine Wisdom. To worship the sun of the world is also to acknowledge nature as she who creates and one's own prudence as she who effects all things; and this involves the denial of God, and the denial of the Divine Providence.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Cf. <a href="../ae/401.htm">Apocalypse Explained 401</a>[20]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 53</h4><p>53. And His face was as the sun shineth in His power, signifies the Divine love and the Divine wisdom, which are Himself, and proceed from Himself. That by "the face of Jehovah," or of the Lord, is meant the Divine Himself in His Essence, which is the Divine love and the Divine wisdom thus Himself, will be seen in the explanations below, where mention is made of "the face of God." The same is signified by "the sun shining in His power." That the Lord is seen as a sun in heaven before the angels, and that it is His Divine love together with His Divine wisdom, which so appear, may be seen in the work concerning Heaven and Hell, published in London, 1758 (<a href="116.htm">116-225</a>); and in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom, (<a href="83.htm">83-172</a>).</p><p>[2] It remains here only to be confirmed from the Word, that the "sun," when mentioned in reference to the Lord, signifies His Divine love, and at the same time His Divine wisdom; this may appear from the following places:<p>In that day the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, it shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, (<a href="3927/isaiah_30_26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>).<p>"That day" is the advent of the Lord when the old church is destroyed, and a new one is about to be established; "the light of the moon" is faith from charity, and "the light of the sun" is intelligence and wisdom from love, and thus from the Lord.<p>Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself; for Jehovah shall be an everlasting light, (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_20.htm">Isaiah 60:20</a>).<p>The sun which shall not set, is love and wisdom from the Lord.<p>The rock of Israel spake unto me, as the light of the morning when the sun ariseth, (<a href="3927/2-samuel_23_3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3-4</a>).<p>The "rock of Israel" is the Lord:<p>His throne shall be as a sun, (<a href="3927/psalms_89_36.htm">Psalms 89:36-37</a>).<p>This is said of David; but by "David" is there meant the Lord.<p>They shall fear thee with the sun.

Quoniam Dominus quoad Divinum Amorem et Divinam Sapientiam per "Solem" intelligitur, ideo Antiqui in sancto cultu verterunt faciem ad orientem solis; et quoque templa sua, qui ritus adhuc perstat. Quod non sol mundi per "Solem" in illis locis intelligatur, constat ex eo, quod prophanum et abominabile fuerit adorare solem et lunam mundi (videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_53/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_25_1-4" target=_top>Numeri 25:1-4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_53/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_4_19" target=_top>Deuteronomius 4:19</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_53/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_17_3" target=_top>17:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_53/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_17_5" target=_top>5</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_53/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_8_1-2" target=_top>Jeremias 8:1-2</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_53/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_43_10" target=_top>43:10</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_53/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_43_13" target=_top>13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_53/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_44_17-19" target=_top>44:17-19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_53/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_44_25" target=_top>25</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_53/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_8_16" target=_top>Ezechiel 8:16</a>); per "solem mundi" enim intelligitur amor sui et fastus propriae intelligentiae, ac amor sui est e diametro oppositus Divino Amori, ac fastus propriae intelligentiae oppositus Divinae Sapientiae: adorare solem mundi est quoque agnoscere Naturam creatricem et propriam prudentiam effectricem omnium, quod involvit negationem Dei et negationem Divinae Providentiae.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;appareat pro "appareant"<p>2.&nbsp;20 pro "7"<p>3.&nbsp;17 pro "37"<p>4.&nbsp;14, 15 pro "15"<p>5.&nbsp;viii. pro "vii."<p>6.&nbsp;Prophetis pro "Prophetas"<p>7.&nbsp;10, 11 pro "10"<p>8.&nbsp;20 pro "7" </p>
