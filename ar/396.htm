<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第396节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>396.“随有响声、雷轰、闪电、地震”表与他们的交流开启后，就听见关于唯信的推理和赞成它的确认，还觉察到他们当中的教会状态正在走向毁灭。“闪电、雷轰、响声”表示经由天上流注而来的启示、领悟和教导（参看<a href="236.htm">236</a>节）；但此处对那些陷入唯信，没有经由天上流注而来的启示、领悟和教导之人来说，“响声、雷轰、闪电”表示关于唯信的推理，以及赞成它的论据和确认；“地震”表示教会状态的改变（<a href="331.htm">331</a>节），在此表示他们当中的教会状态被发觉正在走向毁灭。在灵人界，当某些社群中的教会状态被败坏和颠倒时，就会发生地震。在七个天使开始吹号之前，这位天使将香炉倒在地上，是为了那些在属灵天堂者能与下面那些陷入唯信者之间的交流能凭着流注被开启；由这种交流所产生的赞成它的推理和确认也被听见和觉察到；所以才说交流被开启后，它们被听见和觉察到。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 396</h4><p>396. And there were voices, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake. This symbolically means that after a communication with them was opened, the angels heard reasonings about faith alone and arguments in support of it, and they perceived the state of the church among those below as heading for destruction.<p>Lightnings, thunderings and voices symbolize states of enlightenment, perception, and instruction following an influx from heaven, as can be seen in no. <a href="236.htm">236</a> above. Here, however - in reference to people caught up in faith alone, who had no enlightenment, perception or instruction by virtue of an influx from heaven - the voices, thunderings and lightnings symbolize reasonings about faith alone, and arguments and proofs in support of it.<p>Earthquakes symbolize changes in the state of the church (no. <a href="331.htm">331</a>), here that the state of the church among those below was perceived as heading for destruction. For earthquakes occur in the world of spirits when the state of the church in its societies is corrupted and turned upside down.<p>The angel threw the censer to the earth before the seven angels began to sound with their trumpets, in order that the influx might open a communication between the angels in the spiritual heaven and the spirits below who were caught up in faith alone. It was owing to that communication that reasonings about that faith arose, and proofs in support of it, and these were also audible and perceptible. That is why we say that after the communication was opened, the angels heard and perceived them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 396</h4><p>396. 'And voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake were produced' signifies that after communication was opened with them there were heard reasonings about faith alone and confirmations in favour of it, and that the state of the Church with them was perceived to be tottering to destruction. That 'lightnings, thunderings and voices' signify enlightenments, perceptions and instructions by means of an influx out of heaven may be seen above (<a href="236.htm">236</a>). Here, however, with those who were in faith alone, with whom there was no enlightenment, perception and instruction by influx out of heaven, by 'voices, thunderings and lightnings' are signified reasonings about faith alone, and arguments and confirmations in favour of it. By 'earthquakes' are signified changes of the state of the Church (<a href="331.htm">331</a>), here that the state of the Church with them was perceived to be tottering to destruction; for earthquakes occur in the world of spirits whenever the state of the Church in the societies is perverted and inverted. The reason why the censer was cast upon the ground by the angel before the seven angels began to sound with the trumpets, was in order that by means of the influx communication might be opened between those who were in the spiritual heaven and those below who were in faith alone. As a result of this communication there arose reasonings and confirmations in favour of it, and these also were heard and perceived. Therefore it is said that after the communication was opened they were heard and perceived. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 396</h4><p>396. And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings and an earthquake, signifies that after communication was opened with them, there were heard reasonings concerning faith alone, and confirmations in favor of it, and that the state of the church with them was perceived to be tottering to destruction. That "lightnings, thunders, and voices," signify enlightenments, perceptions, and instructions, by influx from heaven (see above, <a href="236.htm">236</a>); but here, with those who were in faith alone, who have no enlightenment, perception, and instruction by influx from heaven, by voices, thunders, and lightnings, are signified reasonings about faith alone, and arguments and confirmations in favor of it; by "earthquakes" are signified changes of the state of the church, (<a href="331.htm">331</a>), in this case, that the state of the church among them was perceived to be tottering to destruction. For earthquakes take place in the world of spirits, when the state of the church in the societies is perverted and inverted. The reason why the censer was cast unto the earth by the angel, before the seven angels began to sound with the trumpets, was that by influx communication might be opened between those who were in the spiritual heaven, with those below who were in faith alone; from which communication there arose reasonings and confirmations in favor of it, which were also heard and perceived; wherefore it is said that after communication was opened, they were heard and perceived. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 396 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>396. "Et factae sunt voces et tonitrua et fulgura et terrae motus," significat quod postquam communicatio aperta est cum illis, auditae sint ratiocinationes de sola fide et confirmationes pro illa, et perceptus status Ecclesiae apud illos nutans ad interitum. - Quod "fulgura, tonitrua et voces" significent illustrationes, perceptiones et instructiones, per influxum e Caelo, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_396/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_236" target=_top>236</a>); hic autem apud illos qui in sola fide erant, quibus nulla illustratio, perceptio et instructio per influxum e Caelo erant, per "voces, tonitrua et fulgura" significantur ratiocinationes de sola fide, et argumentationes et confirmationes pro illa: per "terrae motus" significantur mutationes status Ecclesiae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_396/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_331" target=_top>331</a>), hic quod perceptus sit status Ecclesiae apud illos nutans ad interitum; fiunt enim terrae motus in Mundo spirituum, quando status Ecclesiae in societatibus pervertitur et invertitur. Quod thuribulum projectum fuerit ab Angelo in terram antequam septem Angeli inciperent clangere tubis, fuit ut per influxum aperiretur communicatio inter illos qui in Caelo spirituali erant, cum illis infra qui in sola fide erant ex qua communicatione exortae sunt ratiocinationes, et confirmationes pro illa, et quoque auditae et perceptae; quare dicitur quod postquam communicatio aperta est, audita et percepta sint illa. </p>
