<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第78节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>78.“也知道你不能容忍恶人”表他们不能容忍邪恶被称为良善，反之亦然，因为这违反教义的真理。这就是这些话的含义，这一点从下文明显可知。因为下句经文表示他们细察那些在教会中被称为良善与真理，实为邪恶与虚假的事。认识良善，知道它们是良善还是邪恶，这属乎教义，可归到教义的真理之列；而行善或作恶则属乎生活。故这论及那些首先关注教义的真理，而非生活的良善之人（<a href="73.htm">73</a>节）。“恶人”在灵义上不是指恶人，而是指邪恶本身，因为灵义是从人物那里抽象出来的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 78</h4><p>78. "'And that you cannot bear those who are evil.'" This symbolically means that they cannot endure to have evils called goods, or the converse, because it is contrary to doctrinal truths.<p>That this declaration has this symbolic meaning is apparent from the one that directly follows, which means, symbolically, that they have examined what in the church are called goods and truths, when in fact they are evils and falsities.<p>Knowing whether goods are good or evil is a matter of doctrine, and a part of its truths, whereas doing goods or evils is a matter of life. The present declaration is made, therefore, of people who regard doctrinal truths primarily, and not goods of life (no. <a href="73.htm">73</a>).<p>In the spiritual sense those who are evil do not mean evil people, but evils themselves, because that sense is abstracted from person. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 78</h4><p>78. 'And that thou canst not bear them who are evil' signifies that they do not support saying evils are goods, and the reverse, because this is against the truths of doctrine. That this is signified by those words is plain from the things just following, by which is signified that they investigate the things in the Church that are said to be good and true, when yet they are evil and untrue. To know goods, whether they are good or evil, is of doctrine, and is among its truths, whereas to do goods or evils is of life. This therefore is said of those who have the truths of doctrine primarily in view, and not the goods of life (<a href="73.htm">73</a>). By 'them that are evil' in the spiritual sense is not understood evil men but evils, because that sense is abstracted from persons. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 78</h4><p>78. And that thou canst not bear the evil, signifies that they cannot bear that evils should be called goods, and the reverse, because this is contrary to the truths of doctrine. That this is the signification of these words, is evident from what follows, by which is signified that they scrutinize those things in the church which are called goods and truths, when yet they are evils and falsities. To know goods, whether they are goods or evils, is of doctrine, and is among its truths, but to do goods or evils is of the life; this is said, therefore, of those who primarily regard the truths of doctrine, and not the goods of life, (<a href="73.htm">73</a>). By "the evil" in the spiritual sense, are not meant the evil but evils, because this sense is abstracted from persons. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 78 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>78. "Et quod non possis ferre malos," significat quod non sustineant mala dici bona et vicissim, quia hoc est contra vera doctrinae. - Quod hoc per illa verba significetur, patet a mox sequentibus, per quae significatur, quod scrutentur illa quae in Ecclesia dicuntur esse bona et vera, cum tamen sunt mala et falsa. Scire bona num sint bona aut mala est doctrinae, et inter vera ejus; at facere bona aut mala, est vitae: quare hoc dicitur de illis qui primario spectant vera doctrinae, et non bona vitae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_78/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_73" target=_top>73</a>). Per "malos" in Sensu spirituali non intelliguntur mali, sed mala, quia ille Sensus est abstractus a personis. </p>
