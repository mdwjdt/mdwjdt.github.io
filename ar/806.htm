<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>806.“并且为淫妇手上所流祂仆人的血伸冤”表因施加在敬拜主者灵魂上的伤害和暴行所受的报应。“为淫妇手上所流祂仆人的血伸冤”之所以表示因施加在敬拜主者灵魂上的伤害和暴行所受的报应，是因为“伸冤”表示报应。“流人血”表示向主的神性和圣言施暴（<a href="327.htm">327</a>，<a href="684.htm">684</a>节）；在此表示向“祂仆人”所指的敬拜主者施暴。他们通过将对主的神性敬拜转到自己身上，并禁止阅读圣言而向这些人的灵魂施加伤害和暴行。这论及主，因为祂为其仆人的血伸冤或报仇，好像祂出于报复或复仇这样做；但其实这不是出于报复或复仇，就像不是出于怒气和忿怒一样，然而，在圣言的许多地方，这些都被归给了主（<a href="525.htm">525</a>，<a href="635.htm">635</a>，<a href="658.htm">658</a>，<a href="673.htm">673</a>节）。当在最后审判之日，恶者与善者分离，被投入地狱时，就说主发怒和报仇；因此，这日被称为“忿怒的日子”，同样被称为“忿怒”，以及“报仇之日”；并非主发怒和报仇，而是恶人向主发怒，报复祂。这就如同罪犯被判刑后迁怒于法律，报复法官；但法律并不发怒，法官也不报仇。</p><p>在以下经文中，“报仇”（或报复）就具有这种意义：</p><p>报仇之日在我心中，救赎我民之年已经来到。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.4.htm">63:4</a>）</p><p>此处论及主和最后的审判。</p><p>耶和华有报仇之日，为锡安的争辩有报应之年。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛34.8.htm">34:8</a>）</p><p>看哪，你们的神必来报仇，祂也与神的报应一同到来，祂必拯救你们。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 35.4.htm"> 35:4</a>）</p><p>这些是报仇的日子，使经上所写一切事都得应验。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.22.htm">21:22</a>）</p><p>此处论述最后的审判到来时的时代末了。</p><p>主耶和华的灵在我身上，报告耶和华美意的日子，和我们神报仇的日子，安慰一切悲哀的人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 61.1.htm"> 61:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 61.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>我的灵魂岂不为此报复呢？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.9.htm">5:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.29.htm">29</a>）</p><p>我要向巴比伦报仇，一个人也不宽容。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.3.htm">47:3</a>）</p><p>耶和华定意攻击巴比伦，将它毁灭，因这是耶和华报仇，就是为自己的殿报仇。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 51.11.htm"> 51:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 51.36.htm">36</a>）</p><p>你们各族人，祂的百姓要歌唱；因祂要伸祂仆人流血的冤，报复祂的敌人，洁净祂的地、祂的百姓。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申 32.43.htm"> 32:43</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 806</h4><p>806. "And He has avenged the blood of His servants shed by her hand." This symbolizes a retribution for the injuries and violence done to the souls of worshipers of the Lord.<p>His avenging the blood of His servants shed by her hand symbolizes a retribution for the injuries and violence done to the souls of worshipers of the Lord, because His avenging symbolizes retribution. To shed blood means, symbolically, to do violence to the Lord's Divinity and to the Word (nos. <a href="327.htm">327</a>, <a href="684.htm">684</a>), in this case to worshipers of the Lord, who are meant by His servants. Roman Catholics inflicted injuries and violence on their souls by transferring Divine worship of the Lord to themselves and preventing their reading of the Word.<p>The Lord is said to have avenged or exacted retribution for the blood of His servants as though He did this to take revenge or punish; but still He does not act to take revenge or punish, just as He does not act out of anger or wrath, even though anger and wrath are occasionally attributed to Him in the Word (see nos. <a href="525.htm">525</a>, <a href="635.htm">635</a>, <a href="658.htm">658</a>, <a href="673.htm">673</a> above).<p>Anger and revenge are attributed to the Lord when evil people are separated from the good and cast into hell, as happens at the time of a last judgment. That time is therefore called wrath and a day of wrath, and a day of vengeance. Not that the Lord is angry or vengeful, but that those people are angry at the Lord and filled with vengeance against Him. The case is like that of a criminal after sentence has been passed, who is angry at the law and filled with vengeance against the judge. For the law is not angry, nor is the judge taking revenge.</p><p>[2] Vengeance is meant in this sense in the following passages:<p>...the day of vengeance is in My heart, and the year of My redeemed has come. (<a href="3927/isaiah_63_4.htm">Isaiah 63:4</a>)<p>The reference there is to the Lord and the Last Judgment.<p>...the day of Jehovah's vengeance, the year of retribution for the case of Zion. (<a href="3927/isaiah_34_8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a>)<p>Behold, your God will come for vengeance; for the retribution of God He will come, and He will save you. (<a href="3927/isaiah_35_4.htm">Isaiah 35:4</a>)<p>...these are the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. (<a href="3927/luke_21_22.htm">Luke 21:22</a>)<p>The reference there is to the culmination of the age, when the Last Judgment takes place.<p>The Spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon Me... to proclaim the day Jehovah's good pleasure, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn. (<a href="3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>)<p>Shall My soul not take vengeance... for this? (<a href="3927/jeremiah_5_9.htm">Jeremiah 5:9</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_29.htm">29</a>)<p>I will take vengeance (on Babylon), and will not allow anyone to intercede. (<a href="3927/isaiah_47_3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>)<p>...His thought is against Babylon to destroy it, because it is the vengeance of Jehovah, vengeance for His temple. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>, cf. <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_36.htm">51:36</a>)<p>Sing, O nations, His people, for He will avenge the blood of His servants, and visit vengeance on His adversaries; He will purge His land, His people. (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 806</h4><p>806. 'And He has avenged the blood of His servants from (de) her hand' signifies retribution on account of the injuries and violent deeds inflicted on the souls of the worshippers of the Lord. By 'He has avenged the blood of His servants from her hand' is signified retribution on account of the injuries and violent deeds inflicted on the worshippers of the Lord because by 'He has revenged' is signified retribution. By 'to shed blood' is signified to inflict violence on the Lord's Divine and the Word (<a href="327.htm">327</a>, <a href="684.htm">684</a>); here on the worshippers of the Lord, who are understood by 'His servants.' They have inflicted injuries and violent deeds upon the souls of these by transferring the Divine worship of the Lord to themselves and preventing the reading of the Word. It is said of the Lord that 'He has avenged' or revenged 'the blood of His servants' as if He did this as the result of vengeance or revenge, but still it is not the result of vengeance or revenge, just as it is not the result of wrath and growing anger, which yet is attributed to the Lord in places in the Word, as may be seen above (<a href="525.htm">525</a>, <a href="635.htm">635</a>, <a href="658.htm">658</a>, <a href="673.htm">673</a>). 'Wrath' and 'vengeance' are said of the Lord when the evil separated from the good are cast into hell, which is done at the day of the last judgment. Therefore that day is called 'the day of wrath' and also 'wrath,' and again 'the day of vengeance'; not that the Lord is angry and vengeful, but that they are angry with the Lord and breathe vengeance against Him. It is like a wrong-doer after sentence is passed being angry with the law and breathing vengeance against the judge; for the law is not angry, neither is the judge vengeful.</p><p>[2] 'Vengeance' is understood in this sense in the following passages:<p>The day of vengeance is in My heart, the year of My redeemed has come. <a href="3927/isaiah_63_4.htm">Isaiah 63:4</a>; treating there of the Lord and of the last judgment.<p>The day of Jehovah's vengeance, the year of retributions for the contention of Zion. <a href="3927/isaiah_34_8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a>.<p>Behold, your God will come with vengeance, He will come with God's retribution, and save you. <a href="3927/isaiah_35_4.htm">Isaiah 35:4</a>.<p>These are the days of vengeance, that all the things that have been written may be fulfilled. <a href="3927/luke_21_22.htm">Luke 21:22</a>; treating there of the consummation of the age when there is the last judgment.<p>The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon Me to proclaim the day of Jehovah's good pleasure, and the day of vengeance for our God, to comfort all who mourn, <a href="3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">Isaiah 61</a>:[<a href="3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">1</a>,] <a href="3927/isaiah_61_2.htm">2</a>.<p>Shall not My soul take revenge for this? <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_9.htm">Jeremiah 5:9</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_29.htm">29</a>.<p>I will take vengeance on Babel, nor will I make a man to intercede. <a href="3927/isaiah_47_3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>.<p>Against Babel is the thought to destroy it, because this is Jehovah's vengeance, the vengeance of His temple. <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_36.htm">36</a>.<p>Sing, O nations, His people: for He has avenged the blood of His servants, and He will render vengeance to His enemies, and will atone for His land, His people. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 806</h4><p>806. And He hath avenged the blood of His servants at her hand, signifies retribution on account of the injuries and violence offered to the souls of the worshipers of the Lord. That by "He hath avenged the blood of His servants at her hand," is signified retribution on account of the injuries and violence offered to the souls of the worshipers of the Lord, because by "He avenged" is signified retribution. By "shedding blood" is signified to offer violence to the Lord's Divinity and to the Word, (<a href="327.htm">327</a>, <a href="684.htm">684</a>); here to the worshipers of the Lord, who are meant by "His servants." They offered injuries and violence to the souls of these by transferring to themselves the Divine worship of the Lord, and by prohibiting the reading of the Word. It is said of the Lord, that He avenged or revenged the blood of His servants, as if He did this from vengeance or revenge; but still it is not from vengeance or revenge, as it is not from anger and wrath, which however are attributed to the Lord in many places in the Word, see above, (<a href="525.htm">525</a>, <a href="635.htm">635</a>, <a href="658.htm">658</a>, <a href="673.htm">673</a>). Anger and vengeance are said of the Lord, when the evil separated from the good are cast into hell, which is done at the day of the Last Judgment; on which account that day is called "a day of anger," and likewise "anger;" also "a day of vengeance;" not that the Lord is angry and avenges, but that they are angry with the Lord, and breathe vengeance against Him. It is as when a malefactor, after sentence is passed, is angry at the law, and breathes vengeance against the judge; for the law is not angry, nor is the judge revengeful.</p><p>[2] "Vengeance" is meant in this sense in the following passages:<p>The day of vengeance is in My heart, and the year of My redeemed is come, (<a href="3927/isaiah_63_4.htm">Isaiah 63:4</a>).<p>Here it treats of the Lord and the last judgment:<p>The day of Jehovah's vengeance, the year of retributions for the controversy of Zion, (<a href="3927/isaiah_34_8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a>).<p>Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the retribution of God will He come, and He will save you, (<a href="3927/isaiah_35_4.htm">Isaiah 35:4</a>).<p>These are the days of vengeance, that all things that are written may be fulfilled, (<a href="3927/luke_21_22.htm">Luke 21:22</a>).<p>Here it treats of the consummation of the age, when the Last Judgment comes:<p>The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon Me, to proclaim the day of the good pleasure of Jehovah, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that mourn, (<a href="3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>).<p>Shall not My soul take vengeance for this, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_5_9.htm">Jeremiah 5:9</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_29.htm">29</a>)?<p>I will take vengeance on Babel, nor will I make a man to intercede, (<a href="3927/isaiah_47_3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>).<p>The thought is against Babel to destroy it, because this is the vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance of His temple, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_36.htm">36</a>).<p>Sing, ye nations, His people; for He hath avenged the blood of His servants, and He will render vengeance to His enemies, and will expiate His land, His people, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 806 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>806. "Et vindicavit sanguinem servorum Suorum de manu ejus," significat retributionem propter damna et violentias illatas animabus cultorum Domini. - Quod per "vindicavit sanguinem servorum Suorum de manu ejus" significetur retributio propter damna et violentias illatas animabus cultorum Domini, est quia per "vindicavit" significatur retributio; per "sanguinem effundere" significatur violentiam inferre Divino Domini et Verbo (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_806/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_327" target=_top>327</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_806/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_684" target=_top>684</a>), hic cultoribus Domini, qui intelliguntur per "servos Ipsius;" horum animabus damna et violentias intulerunt per quod Divinum cultum Domini in se transtulerunt, et inhibuerunt legi Verbum. Dicitur de Domino, quod vindicaverit seu ultus sit sanguinem servorum Suorum, sicut ex vindicta seu ultione hoc fecerit; sed usque non est ex vindicta et ultione, sicut non ex ira et excandescentia, quae tamen Domino passim in Verbo tribuitur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_806/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525" target=_top>525</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_806/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635" target=_top>635</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_806/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_658" target=_top>658</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_806/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_673" target=_top>673</a>).
