<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第460节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>460.“不能看、不能听、不能走的”表它们里头没有丝毫属灵和真正理性的生命。经上之所以这么说，是因为偶像崇拜者以为他们的偶像能看也能听，因他们将这些偶像奉为神明；然而，这还不是这句话的意思；这句话的意思是说，敬拜的虚假里面没有丝毫属灵和真正理性的生命，因为“看”与“听”表示理解与领悟（<a href="7.htm">7</a>，<a href="25.htm">25</a>，<a href="87.htm">87</a>节）；“走”表示活出来（<a href="167.htm">167</a>节）；因此，这三样事物表示属灵和真正理性的生命；之所以表示这一切，是因为“偶像”表示敬拜的虚假，这些虚假里面没有丝毫属灵和理性的生命。偶像不能看、不能听、不能走，这事太过明显，不值得在此一提，所以其中必有某种内在含义。在圣言的其它部分，也是这样论及“偶像”，如以下经文：</p><p>他们不知道、也不明白，他们的眼不能看见，他们的心不能明白，他们没有知识，也没有聪明。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.9.htm">44:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.19.htm">19</a>）</p><p>他们不能说话，也不能行走。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.3.htm">10:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>他们有口却不能言，有眼却不能看。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗115.5.htm">115:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗135.15.htm">135:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗135.16.htm">16</a>）</p><p>这些话之所以表示类似事物，是因为“偶像”表示敬拜的虚假，这些敬拜的虚假里面没有丝毫系真生命的生命之物。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 460</h4><p>460. Which can neither see nor hear nor walk. This symbolically means, which do not have in them any spiritual or truly rational life.<p>This is said because idolaters believe that their idols see and hear, for they make them gods. But still this is not what the statement means. Rather it means that falsities in worship do not have in them any spiritual or truly rational life, as to see and hear means, symbolically, to understand and perceive (nos. <a href="7.htm">7</a>, <a href="25.htm">25</a>, <a href="87.htm">87</a>). To walk, moreover, symbolically means to live (no. <a href="167.htm">167</a>). Thus the three together symbolize a spiritual and truly rational life.<p>This is the symbolic meaning because idols symbolize falsities in worship, and these have no spiritual or rational life in them.<p>The statement that idols do not see, hear, or walk would be too obvious to deserve mention here if it did not have in it some symbolic meaning.<p>Similar statements regarding idols are made elsewhere in the Word, as in the following places:<p>They do not know or understand; ...their eyes... do not see; their hearts... do not know... Nor do they have any knowledge or intelligence... (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_44_18.htm">18-19</a>)<p>...they do not speak..., they do not walk... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_10_3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3-10</a>)<p>They have mouths, but they do not speak; they have eyes, but they do not see. (<a href="3927/psalms_115_5.htm">Psalms 115:5</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_135_15.htm">135:15-16</a>)<p>These statements have a similar symbolic meaning, because idols symbolize falsities in worship, and falsities in worship have in them no life that is real. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 460</h4><p>460. 'Which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk' signifies in which there is nothing of spiritual and truly rational life. These things are said because idolaters believe that their idols see and hear, for they make them gods. Nevertheless by these words such things are not understood, but it is understood that there is nothing of spiritual or truly rational life in untruths of worship, for by 'to see' and 'to hear' is signified to understand and to perceive (<a href="7.htm">7</a>, <a href="25.htm">25</a>, <a href="87.htm">87</a>); and by 'to walk' is signified to live (<a href="167.htm">167</a>). Consequently by these three things spiritual and truly rational life is signified. These things are signified because untruths of worship are signified by idols, and in them there is nothing of spiritual and rational life. That idols do not see, hear and walk is too obvious to be mentioned here unless there were something signified therein. Similar things are also said elsewhere in the Word concerning idols, as in these places:<p>They neither know, nor understand, and their eyes do not see, nor do their hearts know, they have no knowledge and intelligence. <a href="3927/isaiah_44_9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_44_18.htm">18-19</a>.<p>They neither speak nor walk. <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3-10</a>.<p>They have mouths but they speak not, and they have eyes but they see not. <a href="3927/psalms_115_5.htm">Psalms 115:5</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_135_15.htm">135:15-16</a>.<p>Similar things are signified by these statements, because by 'idols' are signified untruths of worship, and in untruths of worship there is nothing of life that is life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 460</h4><p>460. Which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk, signifies in which there is nothing of spiritual and truly rational life. The reason why this is said, is, because idolaters believe that their idols see and hear, for they make them gods; but still this is not what is meant by these words; but, that in the falsities of worship there is nothing of spiritual nor truly rational life, for by "seeing" and "hearing" is signified to understand and perceive, (<a href="2.htm">2</a>, <a href="7.htm">7</a>, <a href="25.htm">25</a>, <a href="87.htm">87</a>); and by "walking" is signified to live, (<a href="167.htm">167</a>[1-2]); therefore by these three things is signified spiritual and truly rational life; this is signified, because by "idols" are signified the falsities of worship, in which there is nothing of spiritual and rational life. That idols do not see, hear, and walk, is a thing too obvious to be here mentioned, were there not some inward signification involved within it. The like is also said of idols in other parts of the Word, as in these passages:<p>They know not nor understand, and their eyes do not see, nor do their hearts know, they have no knowledge nor intelligence, (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_44_18.htm">18-19</a>).<p>They speak not, neither do they walk, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_10_3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3-10</a>).<p>They have a mouth but they speak not, eyes have they but they see not, (<a href="3927/psalms_115_5.htm">Psalms 115:5</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_135_15.htm">135:15-16</a>).<p>By these like things are signified, because by "idols" are signified the falsities of worship, and in falsities of worship there is nothing of life which is really life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 460 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>460. "Quae neque videre possunt, neque audire, neque ambulate," significat in quibus nihil vitae spiritualis et vere rationalis est. - Quod haec dicantur, est quia idololatra credit quod idola eorum videant et audiant, illa enim faciunt deos: at usque non haec per illa verba intelliguntur, sed intelligitur quod in falsis cultus nihil vitae spiritualis nec vere rationalis sit, per "videre" enim et "audire" significatur intelligere et percipere (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_460/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_7" target=_top>7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_460/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_25" target=_top>25</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_460/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_87" target=_top>87</a>), et per "ambulare "significatur vivere (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_460/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_167" target=_top>167</a>); inde per illa tria significatur vita spiritualis et vere rationalis; haec significantur quia per "idola" significantur falsa cultus, et in his nihil vitae spiritualis et rationalis est. Quod idola non videant, audiant et ambulent, manifestius est quam ut hic dicatur, nisi insit aliquid quod significatur. Similia etiam de idolis in Verbo alibi dicuntur, ut in his; <p>"Non cognoscunt, nec intelligunt, et non vident oculi illorum, non cognoscunt corda illorum, non illis scientia et intelligentia est," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_460/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_44_9" target=_top>Esaias 44:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_460/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_44_18-19" target=_top>18-19</a>; <sup>1</sup><p>Non loquuntur nec ambulant, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_460/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_10_3-10" target=_top>Jeremias 10:3-10</a>);<p>"Os illis sed non loquuntur, et oculi illis sed non vident," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_460/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_115_5" target=_top>Psalm 115:5</a>; <sup>2</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_460/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_135_15-16" target=_top>Psalm 135:15-16</a>);<p>per quae similia significantur, quia per "idola" significantur falsa cultus, et in falsis cultus nihil vitae, quae vita, est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;9, 18, 19 pro "9, 20"<p>2.&nbsp;5 pro "15" </p>
