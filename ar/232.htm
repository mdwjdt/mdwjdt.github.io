<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第232节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>232.“又有虹围着宝座，好像绿宝石”表主周围的神性之爱和神性智慧的表象。灵界有各种各样的彩虹，有的看上去具有各种色彩，和世上的一样，有的只有一种色彩。此处即为单色彩虹，因为经上说它“好像绿宝石”。这种表象就在主的周围，因为经上说它“围着宝座”；在主的周围也就是在天使天堂中。环绕主的神性气场来自祂的神性之爱，同时来自祂的神性智慧。当它在天堂被代表时，在属天国度显为红色，就像红宝石；在属灵国度显为蓝色，就像蓝宝石；在属世国度显为绿色，就像绿宝石。无论在何处，它都具有无法言喻的光辉灿烂。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 232</h4><p>232. And there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald. This symbolizes an appearance of the Lord's Divine love and wisdom also around Him.<p>Rainbows of many kinds are seen in the spiritual world. They are seen as having several different colors as on earth, and they are seen as having just one color. The rainbow here was of one color, because it is said to have been like an emerald. This phenomenon was seen around the Lord because it is said to have been around the throne. To be around Him means also to be in the angelic heaven.<p>The Divine atmosphere which surrounds the Lord emanates from both His Divine love and Divine wisdom together, and when that atmosphere is represented in the heavens, it appears in the celestial kingdom red like a ruby, in the spiritual kingdom blue like lapis lazuli, and in the natural kingdom green like an emerald - everywhere with an indescribable splendor and radiance. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 232</h4><p>232. 'And the rainbow round about the throne looked like an emerald' signifies the appearing of these also around the Lord. In the spiritual world rainbows of many kinds appear. They appear of diverse colours as on earth, and they appear of one colour. Here it is one colour, because 'like an emerald' is said. This appearance was around the Lord, because it is said 'round about the throne.' [What is] around Him is also in the angelic heaven. The Divine sphere that encompasses the Lord is out of His Divine Love and at the same time out of His Divine Wisdom, and when this Divine Wisdom is represented in heaven, it appears in the celestial kingdom becoming red like a ruby, in the spiritual kingdom becoming azure like a ligure (cyanus), and in the natural kingdom becoming green like an emerald; everywhere with ineffable splendour and radiance. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 232</h4><p>232. And there was a rainbow round about the throne in appearance like an emerald, signifies the appearance of the same also round about the Lord. In the spiritual world there appear rainbows of many kinds, they appear of various colors as upon the earth, and they appear of one color; here of one color, because it is said "like unto an emerald." This appearance was round about the Lord, because it is said "round about the throne;" round about Him is also in the angelic heaven. The Divine sphere which surrounds the Lord is from His Divine love, and at the same time from His Divine wisdom, which, when it is represented in the heavens, appears in the celestial kingdom red like a ruby, in the spiritual kingdom blue like the lapis lazuli, in the natural kingdom green like the emerald; everywhere with ineffable splendor and radiance. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 232 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>232. "Et his circuitus Throni similis aspectu smaragdo," significat apparentiam illorum etiam circum Dominum. - In mundo spirituali apparent Irides plurium generum; apparent diversicolores sicut in terris, et apparent unius coloris; hic unius coloris, quia dicitur "similis smaragdo;" haec apparentia fuit circum Dominum, quia dicitur "circuitus Throni;" circum Ipsum est quoque in Caelo Angelico. Sphaera Divina, quae ambit Dominum, est ex Ipsius Divino Amore et simul Divina Sapientia, quae cum repraesentatur in Caelis, apparet illa in regno caelesti rubescens instar rubini, in regno spirituali caerulescens instar cyanei, et in regno naturali viridescens instar smaragdi; ubivis cum ineffabili splendore et jubare. </p>
