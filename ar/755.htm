<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第755节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>755.启18:2.“他大声喊着说，巴比伦大城倾倒了，倾倒了”表他叫人们知道，因主的神性大能，凡在天主教，同时通过该宗教而具有统治欲的人在灵界都被毁灭，并被投入众多地狱。这些话就表示这一切，这一点从1758年于伦敦出版的《最后的审判》（<a href="../lj/53.htm">53</a>-<a href="../lj/64.htm">64</a>节）这本小书明显可知，那里描述巴比伦的毁灭；由此可见，天主教中那些出于自我之爱的热向主的神圣神性事物，也就是天堂和教会的事物施加权柄，已然沦为偶像崇拜者的人被毁灭，并被投入地狱。而天主教中那些照十诫生活，避恶如罪，同时注目于主的人得救了，这一事实可见于《最后的审判（续）》（<a href="../clj/58.htm">58</a>节），在此无需赘述。以赛亚书同样论及巴比伦：</p><p>狮子在瞭望塔上吼叫，说，巴比伦倾倒了，倾倒了，她一切雕刻的神像都打碎于地。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.8.htm">21:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>自最后审判时起，凡来自天主教的类似性质的人都被聚集起来，不时被送往下他们的同类那里。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 755</h4><p>755. <a href="3927/revelation_18_2.htm">18:2</a> And he cried mightily with a loud voice, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great." This symbolically means that the influx made known that by the Lord's Divine power, people who were caught up in the Roman Catholic religion and at the same time in a love of exercising dominion because of it, were all destroyed in the spiritual world and cast into numerous hells.<p>That this is the symbolic meaning of these words can be seen from the short work, The Last Judgment and Babylon Destroyed (London, 1758), where Babylon's destruction is described, nos. <a href="53.htm">53-64</a>, from which it can be seen that the people of the Roman Catholic religion who were destroyed and cast into hell were those who, driven by the fire of their self-love, exercised dominion over the Lord's Divine sanctities having to do with heaven and the church, and who were nothing but idolaters. On the other hand, those of the same religion who lived in accordance with the Ten Commandments by refraining from evils as sins, and at the same time looked to the Lord, were saved, as may be seen in A Continuation Concerning the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World, no. <a href="58.htm">58</a>, to which there is no need to add more.<p>Something similar is said of Babylon in Isaiah:<p>A lion cried... on the watchtower... and said, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon! And all the carved images of her gods He has broken to the ground." (<a href="3927/isaiah_21_8.htm">Isaiah 21:8-9</a>)<p>People of that religion of the same character are, since the Last Judgment, gathered together and from time to time sent to their comrades. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 755</h4><p>755. [verse 2] 'And he shouted vigorously with a great voice, saying, It has fallen, Babylon the great has fallen' signifies that he made it known that by the Lord's Divine power all who have been in that form of religion and at the same time in a love of dominating thereby have been destroyed in the spiritual world and cast into many hells. That these things are signified by these words can be established out of the little work CONCERNING THE LAST JUDGMENT AND CONCERNING BABYLON DESTROYED, published at London in the year 1758, where its destruction is described from <a href="53.htm">53-64</a>. As a result of this it can be seen that those of that form of religion who, out of the fever of the love of self, have exercised dominion over the Lord's Holy Divine things that are of heaven and the Church, and were purely and simply idolators, have been destroyed and cast into hell. But that those of the same form of religion who have lived in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue, fleeing from evils as sins, and have at the same time looked to the Lord, have been saved, may be seen in A CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE LAST JUDGMENT AND THE SPIRITUAL WORLD (<a href="../clj/58.htm">58</a>), to which things there is no need to add more. A similar thing is said of Babel in Isaiah:<p>A lion cried upon the watch-tower and said, It has fallen, Babel has fallen, and all the graven images of her gods has he shattered upon the land. <a href="3927/isaiah_21_8.htm">Isaiah 21:8-9</a>.<p>Similar persons of that form of religion are being gathered together since the last judgment, and from time to time are sent to their own [companions]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 755</h4><p>755. Verse 2. And he cried out mightily with a great voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, signifies that he made it known that by the Lord's Divine power all who have been in that religious persuasion, and at the same time in the love of dominion from it, are destroyed in the spiritual world, and are cast into many hells. That this is signified by these words may be evident from the small work on The Last Judgment and the Destruction of Babylon, published at London in the year 1758; where its destruction is described, (<a href="53.htm">53-64</a>); from which it may be seen that those of that religious persuasion who from the heat of the love of self have exercised dominion over the holy Divine things of the Lord, which are those of heaven and the church, and who have been mere idolaters, were destroyed and cast into hell. But that those of the same religious persuasion, who had lived according to the precepts of the Decalogue, shunning evils as sins, and at the same time looked to the Lord, were saved, may be seen in The Continuation Concerning the Last Judgment and Concerning the Spiritual World, (<a href="58.htm">58</a>); to which there is no need to add more. The like is said of Babel in Isaiah:<p>A lion cried upon the watch-towers, and said, Babel is fallen, is fallen, and all the graven images of her gods hath he broken on the earth, (<a href="3927/isaiah_21_8.htm">Isaiah 21:8-9</a>).<p>Similar ones are collected from that religious persuasion since the Last Judgment, and from time to time are sent to their like. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 755 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>755. (Vers. 2.) "Et exclamavit in virtute voce magna, dicens, Cecidit, cecidit Babylon magna," significat quod notum fecerit quod per Divinam potentiam Domini, omnes qui in Religioso illo et simul in amore dominandi ex illo fuerunt, in mundo spirituali destructi sint, et in plura inferna conjecti. - Quod haec per illa verba significentur, constare potest ex Opusculo de Ultimo Judicio et de Babylonia destructa, anno 1758 Londini edito, ubi describitur destructio ejus a <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_755/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_53" target=_top>53</a> ad 64, ex quo videri potest, quod illi ex eo Religioso destructi fuerint et conjecti in Infernum, qui ex oestro amoris sui dominati sunt super Sancta Divina Domini, quae Caeli et Ecclesiae sunt, et qui mere idololatrae fuerunt; quod autem illi ex eodem Religioso, qui vixerunt secundum praecepta Decalogi fugiendo mala ut peccata, et simul spectaverunt ad Dominum, salvati sint, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_755/swedenborg_continuatio-de-ultimo-judicio_58" target=_top>Continuatione de Ultimo Judicio et de Mundo Spirituali 58</a>, quibus plura adjicere non opus est. Simile de Babele dicitur apud Esajam: <p>"Clamavit Leo super specula: et dixit, Cecidit, cecidit Babel, et omnia sculptilia deorum ejus confregit in terram," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_755/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_21_8-9" target=_top>21:8-9</a>).<p>Similes ex illo Religioso post Ultimum Judicium colliguntur, et per vices ad suos mittuntur. </p>
