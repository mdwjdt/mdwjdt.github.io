<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第635节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>635.启14:10，11.“他也必喝神烈怒的酒，此酒斟在神愤怒的杯中纯一不杂”表他们歪曲圣言的良善与真理，并使生命充满这类歪曲。这就是这些话的含义，因为“神烈怒的酒，纯一不杂的酒”表示被歪曲的圣言真理。“神愤怒的杯”表示良善藉以存在的真理同样被歪曲。“喝”表示将它们归为己有，或使生命充满它们。“酒”表示圣言的真理（参看<a href="316.htm">316</a>节）；“神烈怒的酒”表示被玷污和歪曲的圣言真理（<a href="632.htm">632</a>节）；显然，“纯一不杂的酒”表示它被歪曲；“杯”与“酒”所表相同，因为杯子是盛酒的。“喝”之所以表示使生命充满它们，是因为这话是对那些照唯信称义的教义生活之人说的（参看<a href="634.htm">634</a>节）。“掺杂的酒”（或起沫的酒，mixing wine）和“掺杂物”（或搀杂的料mixture）表示对真理的歪曲，如诗篇：</p><p>耶和华手里有杯，那酒起沫，满了搀杂的料，祂倒出来，地上所有的恶人必都喝。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗75.8.htm">75:8</a>）</p><p>在圣言的许多经文中，“烈怒”和“愤怒”一起被提及，在这种情况下，“烈怒”论及邪恶，“愤怒”论及虚假，因为那些陷入邪恶的人会“烈怒”，而那些陷入虚假的人则会“愤怒”；在圣言中，二者都被归给耶和华，也就是主，其实这是指人对主发烈怒和愤怒（参看<a href="525.htm">525</a>节）。在圣言中，“烈怒”和“愤怒”一起被提及；这一点从以下经文明显看出来:</p><p>耶和华在愤怒和烈怒中临到；在祂烈怒的愤怒日子里，地必离其本位。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.5.htm">13:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>亚述是我烈怒的棍，我要吩咐他攻击我所愤怒的百姓，（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 10.5.htm"> 10:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 10.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>我要在烈怒和愤怒中攻击你们。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 21.5.htm"> 21:5</a>）</p><p>我在烈怒和愤怒中将他们招聚出来。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 32.37.htm"> 32:37</a>）</p><p>耶和华向万族发烈怒，向他们的全军发愤怒。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 34.2.htm"> 34:2</a>）</p><p>耶和华向以愤怒和烈怒施行报应。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.15.htm">66:15</a>）</p><p>我要发烈怒，踹下众民，发愤怒，使他们沉醉。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 63.6.htm"> 63:6</a>）</p><p>我的烈怒和愤怒必倾在这地方。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.20.htm">7:20</a>）</p><p>此外还有其它经文中的（如耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.5.htm">33:5</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结5.13.htm">5:13</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申29.28.htm">29:28</a>）；有些经文提到“烈怒的愤怒”（如以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.13.htm">13:13</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.49.htm">78:49</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.50.htm">50</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.14.htm">6:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.15.htm">15</a>）。以赛亚书：</p><p>公义和力量惟独在乎耶和华，凡向祂发怒的必至蒙羞。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.24.htm">45:24</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 635</h4><p>635. <a href="3927/revelation_14_10.htm">14:10</a> "He himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed with pure wine in the cup of His indignation." This symbolically means that they falsify the Word's goods and truths and steep themselves in a life in accordance with their falsification of them.<p>This is the symbolic meaning of this declaration, because the wine of the wrath of God mixed with pure wine symbolizes the Word's truth falsified. The cup of His indignation symbolizes truth which leads to good, likewise falsified. And to drink means, symbolically, to adopt these falsified truths, or to steep oneself in a life in accordance with them.<p>That wine symbolizes the Word's truth may be seen in no. <a href="316.htm">316</a>. That the wine of the wrath of God symbolizes the Word's truth adulterated and falsified may be seen in no. <a href="632.htm">632</a>. Being mixed with pure wine clearly symbolizes its falsification. The cup also has the same symbolic meaning as the wine, because the cup is its containing vessel.<p>To drink means, symbolically, to steep one's life in the falsifications, because this declaration is made to people who live in accordance with the doctrine of justification by faith alone, as may be seen just above in no. <a href="634.htm">634</a>.<p>Mixing wine, or wine mixed, symbolizes the falsification of truth also in the book of Psalms:<p>...in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and He has mixed it with wine; He has filled it with mixed wine and poured it out, and... all the impious of the earth shall drink it. (<a href="3927/psalms_75_8.htm">Psalms 75:8</a>)</p><p>[2] The Word in many places mentions wrath and indignation together, and wrath there is predicated of evil, while indignation is predicated of falsity, because people caught up in evil are wrathful, while people caught up in falsity are indignant. Both characteristics, moreover, are in the Word attributed to Jehovah, that is, to the Lord, but it means that someone is wrathful or indignant at the Lord (see no. <a href="525.htm">525</a> above).<p>That the Word mentions wrath and indignation together is apparent from the following passages there:<p>...Jehovah comes... with indignation and wrath... ...the earth will move out of her place... in the day (of the indignation) of His wrath. (<a href="3927/isaiah_13_5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">13</a>)<p>...Assyria, the rod of My wrath... I will order him... against the people of My indignation (<a href="3927/isaiah_10_4.htm">Isaiah 10:4-7</a>)<p>I... will fight against you... in wrath... and in... indignation. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_21_5.htm">Jeremiah 21:5</a>)<p>Behold, I am gathering them... in My wrath and in My indignation... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_32_37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37</a>)<p>...the wrath of Jehovah is against all nations, and His indignation against the whole host of them. (<a href="3927/isaiah_34_2.htm">Isaiah 34:2</a>)<p>...Jehovah... will repay in His indignation and wrath... (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>)<p>I have trodden down the peoples in My wrath, and made them drunk in My indignation... (<a href="3927/isaiah_63_6.htm">Isaiah 63:6</a>)<p>...My wrath and My indignation will be poured out on this place... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_7_20.htm">Jeremiah 7:20</a>)<p>And so on elsewhere, as in <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_5.htm">Jeremiah 33:5</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_5_13.htm">Ezekiel 5:13</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_29_28.htm">Deuteronomy 29:28</a>. Also the indignation of wrath, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>.<p>But in Isaiah:<p>Only in Jehovah... righteousness and strength... And all shall be ashamed who are indignant against Him. (<a href="3927/isaiah_45_24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 635</h4><p>635. [verse 10] 'He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God mixed with undiluted wine in the cup of His growing anger' signifies that they falsify the goods and truths of the Word, and imbue their life with the same when falsified. These things are signified by these words because by 'the wine of the wrath of God mixed with undiluted wine' is signified the truth of the Word falsified; and by 'the cup of His growing anger' is signified the truth by means of which there is good, likewise falsified; and by 'to drink' is signified to appropriate them, or to imbue their life with them. That by 'wine' is signified the Truth of the Word may be seen (<a href="316.htm">316</a>); by 'the wine of the wrath of God,' the truth of the Word adulterated and falsified (<a href="632.htm">632</a>); by 'mixed with undiluted wine' is plainly signified what is falsified. The like is signified also by 'the cup' as by 'the wine' because the cup is the containing vessel. 'To drink' signifies to imbue the life with these [falsified truths] because these things have been said to those who are living in accordance with the doctrine of justification by faith alone, as may be seen just above (<a href="634.htm">634</a>). By 'to mix wine' and 'the mixture' is signified the falsification of truth in David also:<p>A cup is in the hand of Jehovah, and He has mixed the wine, filled it with the mixture, and poured it out, and all the wicked of the land shall drink. <a href="3927/psalms_75_8.htm">Psalms 75:8</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_75_9.htm">9</a>].</p><p>[2] In the Word in many places 'wrath' is mentioned, and at the same time 'growing anger,' and there 'wrath' is predicated of evil and 'growing anger' of untruth, because those who are in evil are wrathful and those who are in untruth become angry; and both in the Word are attributed to Jehovah, that is to the Lord, but it is understood that this is on the part of man against the Lord (quad sit hominis contra Dominum), as may be seen above (<a href="525.htm">525</a>). That in the Word 'wrath' and 'growing anger' are mentioned together is plain from these statements there:<p>Jehovah comes in growing anger and wrath; the land shall be violently moved out of its place in the day of the growing anger of His wrath. <a href="3927/isaiah_13_5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">13</a>.<p>Asshur the rod of My wrath, I will command him against the people of My growing anger. <a href="3927/isaiah_10_4.htm">Isaiah 10:4-7</a>.<p>I will fight against you in wrath and in growing anger. <a href="3927/jeremiah_21_5.htm">Jeremiah 21:5</a>.<p>The wrath of Jehovah is against all the nations, and growing anger against all their armies. <a href="3927/isaiah_34_2.htm">Isaiah 34:2</a>.<p>Jehovah will repay in growing anger and with His wrath. <a href="3927/isaiah_66_15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>.<p>I have trodden down the people in My wrath, and made them drunk in My growing anger. <a href="3927/isaiah_63_6.htm">Isaiah 63:6</a>.<p>My wrath and growing anger has been poured out upon this place. <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_20.htm">Jeremiah 7:20</a>.<p>Besides elsewhere, as <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_5.htm">Jeremiah 33:5</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_5_13.htm">Ezekiel 5:13</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_29_27.htm">Deuteronomy 29:27</a>; and 'the growing anger of wrath,' <a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_78_49.htm">Psalms 78:49-50</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_6_14.htm">Deuteronomy 6:14-15</a>. But in Isaiah:<p>Only in Jehovah is there justice and strength, and all shall be ashamed who have grown angry against Him. <a href="3927/isaiah_45_24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 635</h4><p>635. Verse 10. He also shall drink of the wine of the anger of God mixed with unmixed wine in the cup of His wrath, signifies that they falsify the goods and truths of the Word, and imbue the life with such falsifications. This is the signification of these words, because by "the wine of the anger of God mixed with unmixed wine" is signified the truth of the Word falsified. And by "the cup of His wrath," is signified truth by which is good, in like manner falsified. And by "drinking" is signified to appropriate them, or to imbue the life with them. That by "wine" is signified the truth of the Word, may be seen, (<a href="316.htm">316</a>); by "the wine of the anger of God," the truth of the Word adulterated and falsified, (<a href="632.htm">632</a>); by "mixed with unmixed wine" is evidently signified its being falsified; by "a cup" also, the like is signified as by "wine," because a cup is that which contains it. The reason why "to drink" signifies to imbue the life with them, is because this is said to those who live according to the doctrine of justification by faith alone; see above, (<a href="634.htm">634</a>). By "mixing wine" and by "mixture" is signified the falsification of truth, in David:<p>In the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine is mixed, it is full of mixture, and He poureth it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink, (<a href="3927/psalms_75_8.htm">Psalms 75:8</a>).</p><p>[2] In many parts of the Word "anger" and "wrath" are mentioned together, and in such cases "anger" is predicated of evil, and "wrath" of falsity, because they who are in evil are angry, and they who are in falsity are in wrath; and both in the Word, are attributed to Jehovah, that is, to the Lord, but it is meant that they take place in man against the Lord; see above, (<a href="525.htm">525</a>). That, in the Word, "anger" and "wrath," are mentioned together, appears from these passages:<p>Jehovah cometh in wrath and anger; the earth shall remove out of her place, in the day of the wrath of His anger, (<a href="3927/isaiah_13_5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">13</a>).<p>Assyria, the rod of My anger, I will command him against the people of My wrath, (<a href="3927/isaiah_10_5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>).<p>I will fight against you in anger and in wrath, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_21_5.htm">Jeremiah 21:5</a>).<p>The anger of Jehovah is against all nations, and His wrath against all their armies, (<a href="3927/isaiah_34_2.htm">Isaiah 34:2</a>).<p>Jehovah will recompense His wrath with anger, (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>).<p>I will tread down the people in My anger, and make them drunk in My wrath, (<a href="3927/isaiah_63_6.htm">Isaiah 63:6</a>).<p>My anger and My wrath shall be poured out upon this place, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_7_20.htm">Jeremiah 7:20</a>; besides other passages, as in <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_5.htm">Jeremiah 33:5</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_5_13.htm">Ezekiel 5:13</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_29_27.htm">Deuteronomy 29:27</a>; and wrath of anger:<a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_78_49.htm">Psalms 78:49-50</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_6_14.htm">Deuteronomy 6:14-15</a>).<p>And in Isaiah:<p>Only in Jehovah is there justice and strength, and all that are incensed against Him shall be ashamed, (<a href="3927/isaiah_45_24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 635 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>635. (Vers. 10.) "Et ille bibet ex vino irae Dei mixto mero in poculo excandescentiae Ipsius," significat quod illi falsificent bona et vera Verbi, ac imbuant vitam ex illis falsificatis.--Haec significantur per illa verba, quia per "vinum irae Dei mixtum mero" significatur verum Verbi falsificatum; et per "poculum excandescentiae Ipsius" significatur verum per quod bonum, similiter; et per "bibere" significatur appropiare illa, seu imbuere vitam ex illis. Quod per "vinum" significetur Verum Verbi, videatur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_316" target=_top>316</a>); per "vinum irae Dei," Verum Verbi adulteratum et falsificatum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_632" target=_top>632</a>); per "mixtum mero" significatur plane falsificatum; simile etiam significatur per "poculum" quod per "vinum," quia poculum est continens. Quod "bibere" significet imbuere vitam ex illis, est quia haec dicta sunt ad illos qui vivunt secundum doctrinam justificationis per solam Fidem (videatur mox supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_634" target=_top>634</a>). Per "miscere vinum" et "mixtum" significatur falsificatio veri etiam apud Davidem: <p>"Calix in manu Jehovae, et vino miscuit, implevit mixto, et effudit, et bibent omnes impii terrae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_75_9" target=_top>Psalm 75:9</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_75_8" target=_top>8</a>)).<p>In Verbo multis in locis dicitur "ira" et simul "excandescentia;" et ibi "ira" praedicatur de malo, et "excandescentia" de falso, quia illi qui in malo sunt irascuntur, et illi qui in falso excandescunt; ac utraque in Verbo tribuitur Jehovae, hoc est Domino, sed intelligitur quod sit hominis contra Dominum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525" target=_top>525</a>). <sup>1</sup>Quod in Verbo "ira" et "excandescentia" simul dicantur, patet ex his ibi: <p>Jehovah venit in Excandescentia et Ira: "commovebitur terra e loco suo in die Excandescentiae irae Ipsius," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_13_5" target=_top>Esaias 13:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_13_9" target=_top>9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_13_13" target=_top>13</a>);<p>"Aschur, virga Irae Meae, contra populum Excandescentiae Meae mandabo illum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_10_5-6" target=_top>Esaias 10:5-6</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>"Pugnabo contra vos in Ira et in Excandescentia," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_21_5" target=_top>Jeremias 21:5</a>); <sup>3</sup><p>"Ira Jehovae contra omnes gentes, et Excandescentia contra omnem exercitum eorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_34_2" target=_top>Esaias 34:2</a>);<p>"Jehovah retribuet in Excandescentia et Ira Sua," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_66_15" target=_top>Esaias 66:15</a>);<p>"Conculcavi populos in Ira Mea, et inebriavi illos in Excandescentia Mea," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_63_6" target=_top>Esaias 63:6</a>);<p>"Ira et Excandescentia Mea effusa est super locum hunc," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_7_20" target=_top>Jeremias 7:20</a>).<p>(Praeter alibi, ut <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_33_5" target=_top>Jeremias 33:5</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_5_13" target=_top>Ezechiel 5:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_29_27" target=_top>Deuteronomius 29:27</a>). <p>Et "Excandescentia irae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_13_13" target=_top>Esaias 13:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_78_49-50" target=_top>Psalm 78:49-50</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_6_14-15" target=_top>Deuteronomius 6:14-15</a>).  <sup>4</sup><p>Et apud Esajam: <p>"Tantummodo in Jehovah justitia et robur, et pudefient omnes qui Excanduerunt contra Ipsum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_45_24" target=_top>45:24</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;525 pro "575"<p>2.&nbsp;5, 6 pro "4 ad 7"<p>3.&nbsp;21:5 pro "33:35"<p>4.&nbsp;vi. pro "iv." </p>
