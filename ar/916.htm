<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第916节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>916.启21:21.“十二个门是十二颗珍珠，每门是一颗珍珠”表对主的承认和认知将对源于圣言的真理与良善的一切认知结合为一体，并引入新教会。“十二个门”表示对真理与良善的综合认知，人藉此被引入教会（<a href="899.htm">899</a>，<a href="900.htm">900</a>节）。“十二颗珍珠”也表示对真理与良善的综合认知（<a href="727.htm">727</a>节）。这就是为何“门是珍珠”。经上之所以说“每门是一颗珍珠”，是因为众“门”和众“珍珠”所表示的对一切真理与良善的认知都与将它们联结起来的一个认知有关，“这一个认知”就是对主的认知。尽管有许多认知构成这一个认知，我们仍说是“一个认知”；因为对主的认知是教义全部事物、因而教会全部事物的共性。一切敬拜皆由此得其生命和灵魂，因为主就是天堂和教会的全部事物，因而是敬拜的全部事物中的一切。</p><p>对主的承认和认知之所以将对源于圣言的真理与良善的一切认知结合为一体，是因为一切属灵真理只有一种联结，若你愿意相信的话，它们的联结就像是身体的所有肢体、肺腑和器官的联结。因此，正如灵魂将所有这些事物按其次序和关联凝聚在一起，以致它们只被感觉为一体，主以同样的方式将人里面的一切属灵真理凝聚在一起。主就是那藉以进入教会，并由此进入天堂的那道门，对此，祂自己在约翰福音中教导说：</p><p>我就是门，凡从我进来的，必然得救。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.9.htm">10:9</a>）</p><p>主在马太福音的话表示对主的承认和认知就是“珍珠”本身：</p><p>天国又好像买卖人寻找好珠子，遇见一颗重价的珠子，就去变卖他一切所有的，买了这颗珠子。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.45.htm">13:45</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.46.htm">46</a>）</p><p>“一颗重价的珠子”就是对主的承认和认知。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 916</h4><p>916. <a href="3927/revelation_21_21.htm">21:21</a> The twelve gates were twelve pearls: each gate was of one pearl. This symbolically means that an acknowledgment and concept of the Lord join all the concepts of truth and goodness in the Word into one and introduce into the church.<p>The twelve gates symbolize in sum the concepts of truth and goodness by which a person is introduced into the church (nos. <a href="899.htm">899</a>, <a href="900.htm">900</a>). Twelve pearls also symbolize in sum concepts of truth and goodness (no. <a href="727.htm">727</a>). That is why the gates were pearls. Each gate was of one pearl because all the concepts of truth and goodness symbolized by the gates and by pearls relate to a single concept, one that is their containing vessel, and that single concept is a concept of the Lord. We say, a single concept, even though there are many that make up that single concept, for a concept of the Lord pervades all other doctrinal concepts, and so all concerns having to do with the church. All matters of worship take their life and soul from that concept, for the Lord is everything in the whole of heaven and the church, and so in the whole of worship.</p><p>[2] An acknowledgment and concept of the Lord join all the concepts of truth and goodness in the Word into one because all spiritual truths are connected, and if you would believe it, their connection is like the connection between all the members, viscera and organs of the human body. Consequently, as the soul holds everything together in their organization and connection, so that they are sensed only as a unit, so the Lord holds together all the spiritual truths that a person possesses.<p>That the Lord is the true door by which one is to enter into the church and so into heaven, He Himself teaches in John:<p>I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved... (<a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">John 10:9</a>)<p>And that an acknowledgement and concept of Him is the true pearl is meant by these words of the Lord in Matthew:<p>...the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one precious pearl, went and sold all that he had and bought it. (<a href="3927/matthew_13_45.htm">Matthew 13:45-46</a>)<p>The one precious pearl is an acknowledgment and concept of the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 916</h4><p>916. [verse 21] 'And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, and each one of the gates was of one pearl' signifies that the acknowledgment and cognition of the Lord conjoins into one all the cognitions of truth and good that are derived from the Word, and introduces into the Church. By 'the twelve gates' are signified in a summary the cognitions of truth and good by which a man is introduced into the Church (<a href="899.htm">899-900</a>). By the 'twelve pearls' are also signified cognitions of truth and good in a summary (<a href="727.htm">727</a>). This is why the gates were pearls. The reason why 'each one of the gates was of one pearl' is because all the cognitions of truth and good that are signified by' the gates' and 'the pearls' relate to one cognition which is holding them together, and this one cognition' is the cognition of the Lord. It is said 'one cognition,' although there are many cognitions making up that one cognition'; for the cognition of the Lord is the universal of all the things of the doctrine and consequently of all the things of the Church. All worship draws its life and soul therefrom, for the Lord is everything in all the things of heaven and the Church, and consequently in all the things of worship.</p><p>[2] The reason why the acknowledgment and cognition of the Lord conjoins all the cognitions of truth and good derived from the Word into one is because there is a connection of all spiritual truths (veritas), and, if you are willing to believe it, their connection is like the connection of all the members, viscera and organs of the body. And therefore just as the soul holds together all those things in their order and connection, so that they are not felt otherwise than as one, in like manner the Lord holds together all the spiritual truths (veritas) with a man. That the Lord is the very Gate by which entry should be made into the Church and thereby into heaven, He Himself teaches in John:<p>I am the Door, by Me if anyone enters in, he shall be saved. <a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">John 10:9</a>.<p>And that the acknowledgment and cognition of Himself is the 'pearl' itself is understood by these words of the Lord in Matthew:<p>The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a merchant man seeking beautiful pearls who, when he had found one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it. <a href="3927/matthew_13_45.htm">Matthew 13:45-46</a>; the 'one pearl of great value' being the acknowledgment and cognition of the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 916</h4><p>916. Verse 21. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was of one pearl, signifies that the acknowledgment and knowledge of the Lord, conjoins into one all the knowledges of truth and good, which are from the Word, and introduce into the church. By "the twelve gates" are signified the knowledges of truth and good in a summary, by which man is introduced into the church, (<a href="899.htm">899</a>, <a href="900.htm">900</a>). By "twelve pearls" is also signified the knowledges of truth and good in a summary, (<a href="727.htm">727</a>), hence it was that "the gates" were "pearls;" the reason why "each of the gates was of one pearl" is because all the knowledges of truth and good, which are signified by "gates" and by "pearls," have relation to one knowledge; which is their containant, which one knowledge is the knowledge of the Lord. It is called one knowledge, although there are many which constitute that one knowledge; for the knowledge of the Lord is the universal of all things of doctrine and thence of all things of the church; from it all worship derives its life and soul, for the Lord is the all in all of heaven and the church, and thence in all things of worship.</p><p>[2] The reason why the acknowledgment and knowledge of the Lord conjoins into one all the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, is because there is a connection of all spiritual truths, and if you will believe it, their connection is like the connection of all the members, viscera, and organs of the body; wherefore as the soul contains all these in their order and connection, so that they are felt no otherwise than as one, so, in like manner, the Lord holds together all spiritual truths with man. That the Lord is the very gate, by which men are to enter into the church and thence into heaven, He Himself teaches in John:<p>I am the door; by Me if anyone enter in, he shall be saved, (<a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">John 10:9</a>).<p>And that the acknowledgment and knowledge of Him is the pearl itself, is meant by these words of the Lord in Matthew:<p>The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, who when he had found one precious pearl, went and sold all that he had, and bought it, (<a href="3927/matthew_13_45.htm">Matthew 13:45-46</a>).<p>"One precious pearl" is the acknowledgment and knowledge of the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 916 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>916. (Vers. 21.) "Et duodecim portae duodecim margaritae, et unaquaevis portarum erat ex una margarita," significat quod agnitio et cognitio Domini omnes cognitiones veri et boni, quae ex Verbo sunt, conjungat in unum, et introducat in Ecclesiam. - Per "duodecim portas" significantur cognitiones veri et boni in summa, per quas homo introducitur in Ecclesiam (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_916/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_899" target=_top>899</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_916/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_900" target=_top>900</a>); per "duodecim margaritas" etiam significantur cognitiones veri et boni in summa (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_916/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_727" target=_top>727</a>); inde erat quod "portae" fuerint "margaritae:" quod "unaquaevis portarum esset ex una margarita," est quia omnes cognitiones veri et boni, quae per "portas" et per "margaritas" significantur, se referunt ad unam cognitionem, quae est continens illarum, quae una cognitio est cognitio Domini. Dicitur una cognitio, tametsi plures sunt quae unam illam cognitionem faciunt; cognitio enim Domini est universalis omnium doctrinae et inde omnium Ecclesiae; ex illa trahunt omnia cultus suam vitam et animam, nam Dominus est Omne in omnibus Caeli et Ecclesiae, et inde in omnibus cultus. Quod agnitio et cognitio Domini omnes cognitiones veri et boni ex Verbo conjungat in unum, est quia nexus est omnium veritatum spiritualium, et si velitis credere, est nexus illarum sicut nexus omnium membrorum, viscerum et organorum corporis; quare sicut anima continet omnia illa in ordine et nexu, ita ut non aliter sentiantur quam unum, similiter Dominus continet apud hominem omnes veritates spirituales. Quod Dominus sit ipsa Porta, per quam ingrediendum est in Ecclesiam et inde Caelum, docet Ipse apud Johannem: <p>"Ego sum Janua; per Me si quis introiverit, salvabitur," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_916/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_10_9" target=_top>10:9</a>);<p>et quod agnitio et cognitio Ipsius sit Ipsa margarita, intelligitur per haec Domini verba apud Matthaeum: <p>"Simile est Regnum Caelorum homini negotiatori quaerenti pulchras Margaritas, qui cum invenisset unam pretiosam Margaritam, abiit et vendidit omnia quae habuit, et emit eam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_916/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_13_45-46" target=_top>13:45-46</a>);<p>"una pretiosa margarita" est agnitio et cognitio Domini. </p>
