<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>360.启7:8.“约瑟支派中受印的有一万二千”表那些将要属于主的新天堂和新教会之人所具有的良善与真理的教义。在至高意义上，“约瑟”表示主的属灵神性；在属灵意义上，表示属灵国度；在属世意义上，表示繁殖和增多；但此处“约瑟”表示那些在主的属灵国度中之人所具有的良善与真理的教义。“约瑟”在此之所以具有这种含义，是因为他的名排在西布伦支派之后、便雅悯支派之前，因而在中间；在一个系列或次序中，首先提及的支派表示属于意愿的某种爱；在它之后提及的支派则表示属于认知的某种智慧之物；最后提及的支派表示源于它们的某种功用或效果。因此，每个系列都是完全的。“约瑟”因表示主的属灵国度，故被立为埃及的宰相（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创41.38.htm">41:38</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创41.44.htm">44</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.17.htm">105:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.22.htm">22</a>），那里的每个细节都表示诸如属于主的属灵国度的那类事物。属灵国度是主的王权，属天国度是主的祭司职分。</p><p>“约瑟”在此之所以表示良善与真理的教义，是因为他在此代替“以法莲”，而“以法莲”表示的智识（the intellectual）（参看《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》，<a href="../ss/79.htm">79</a>节）；教会的智识是出于取自圣言的良善与真理的教义的全部。约瑟在此之所以代替以法莲，是因为约瑟的次子、表示教会意志的玛拿西在前面已被列入支派（<a href="355.htm">355</a>节）。教会的智识因源于良善与真理的教义，故在以下经文中，“约瑟”就表示这智识，因而表示这教义：</p><p>约瑟是多结果子的人，是泉旁多结果的枝子；他必凭他弓的力量而坐；他必被赐予上面来的天福，伏于下面的渊泉之福。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.22.htm">49:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.26.htm">26</a>）</p><p>此处“泉”表示圣言，“弓”表示教义（<a href="299.htm">299</a>节）。</p><p>愿约瑟的地蒙耶和华赐福，得天上的宝物、甘露，以及下面所藏的渊泉；得日头出产的佳果，月亮所产出的宝物；得地和其中所充满的宝物；愿这些都临到约瑟的头上。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申 33.13.htm"> 33:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申 33.17.htm">17</a>）</p><p>“宝物”表示对良善与真理的认知，教义由此而来。</p><p>以大碗喝酒，却不为约瑟的破败痛心。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩6.6.htm">6:6</a>）</p><p>我要使犹大家强盛起来，拯救约瑟家；以法莲人必如勇士，他们心中畅快如同喝酒。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚10.6.htm">10:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚10.7.htm">7</a>）</p><p>此处“约瑟”也表示教义，“酒”表示源自良善的教义真理（<a href="316.htm">316</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 360</h4><p>360. Of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand were sealed. This symbolizes a doctrine of goodness and truth in those people who will be part of the New Heaven and of the Lord's New Church.<p>In the highest sense Joseph symbolizes the Lord in respect to His Divinity on the spiritual plane; in the spiritual sense, the spiritual kingdom; and in the natural sense, reproduction and multiplication. Here, however, Joseph symbolizes the doctrine of goodness and truth that is found in people who are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom. Joseph has this symbolism here because he is named after the tribe of Zebulun and before the tribe of Benjamin, thus in between them, and the tribe mentioned first in a series or group symbolizes some love pertaining to the will; the tribe mentioned after that symbolizes some aspect of wisdom pertaining to the intellect; and the tribe mentioned last symbolizes some useful outcome or effect resulting from them. Every series is thus a complete one.<p>Since Joseph symbolized the Lord's spiritual kingdom, therefore He was made ruler in Egypt (<a href="3927/genesis_41_38.htm">Genesis 41:38-44</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_105_17.htm">Psalms 105:17-22</a>), where every particular has a symbolic meaning that has to do with the Lord's spiritual kingdom.<p>The spiritual kingdom is the Lord's royal one, while the celestial kingdom is His priestly one.</p><p>[2] Joseph here symbolizes a doctrine of goodness and truth because he is substituted here for Ephraim, and Ephraim symbolizes the intellectual component of the church (see <a href="../ss/79.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture 79</a>), the intellectual component of the church being everything derived from the doctrine of goodness and truth drawn from the Word.<p>Joseph is substituted here for Ephraim because Manasseh, Joseph's second son, who symbolized the volitional component of the church, was already included among the tribes (no. <a href="355.htm">355</a>).<p>Because the intellectual component of the church is derived from a doctrine of goodness and truth, therefore Joseph symbolizes this intellectual component and also that doctrine in the following places:<p>Joseph is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a spring... His bow remained in strength... (He will be blessed) with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lies beneath... (<a href="3927/genesis_49_22.htm">Genesis 49:22-26</a>)<p>The spring symbolizes the Word, and the bow doctrine (no. <a href="299.htm">299</a>).<p>Blessed of Jehovah is (Joseph's) land, with the precious things of heaven, with the dew, and the deep lying beneath, and with the precious fruits of the sun, with the precious produce of the months, and... with the precious things of the earth and its fullness... Let it come on the head of Joseph... (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13-17</a>)<p>The precious things symbolize concepts of goodness and truth, from which comes doctrine.<p>...who drink from goblets of wine, and... are not grieved over the shattering of Joseph. (<a href="3927/amos_6_6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>)<p>I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph... (Hence) they shall be like mighty Ephraim, and their heart shall rejoice as if with wine. (<a href="3927/zechariah_10_6.htm">Zechariah 10:6-7</a>)<p>Here, too, Joseph stands for doctrine, the wine symbolizing its truth springing from goodness (no. <a href="316.htm">316</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 360</h4><p>360. 'Out of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand sealed' signifies the doctrine of good and truth with those who will belong to the New Heaven and the Lord's New Church. By 'Joseph' [in the highest sense] is signified the Lord as to the Spiritual Divine, in the spiritual sense the spiritual kingdom, and in the natural sense fructification and multiplication. Here, however, by 'Joseph' is signified the doctrine of good and truth that is with those who are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom, This is signified here by 'Joseph' because he is named after the tribe of Zebulon and before the tribe of Benjamin, thus in the middle; and the tribe that is named first in a series or division signifies some love that is of the will, while the tribe that is named after it signifies something of the wisdom that is of the understanding, and the tribe that is named last of all signifies some use or effect derived from them. Consequently any one series is a full series. Since 'Joseph' used to signify the Lord's spiritual kingdom, he was therefore made ruler in Egypt (<a href="3927/genesis_41_38.htm">Genesis 41:38-44</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_105_17.htm">Psalms 105:17-22</a>), where the details (singula) signify such things as are of the Lord's spiritual kingdom. The spiritual kingdom is the Lord's Royalty, and the celestial kingdom is His Priesthood.</p><p>[2] 'Joseph' here signifies the doctrine of good and truth, because he is here in place of Ephraim, and by 'Ephraim' is signified the intellectual of the Church (see <a href="../ss/79.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 79</a>); and the intellectual of the Church is everything out of the doctrine of good and truth out of the Word. Joseph is here in place of Ephraim because Manasseh, who was the other son of Joseph and used to signify the voluntary of the Church, has been reckoned before among the tribes (<a href="355.htm">355</a>). Because the intellectual of the Church is out of the doctrine of good and truth, therefore that intellectual and also that doctrine is signified by 'Joseph' in the following passages:<p>Joseph is the son of a fruitful one, a fruitful one close to a fountain; his bow is set in strength; he shall be blessed with the blessings of heaven from above, and the blessings of the deep lying below. <a href="3927/genesis_49_22.htm">Genesis 49:22-26</a>.<p>A 'fountain' signifies the Word, and a 'bow' doctrine (<a href="299.htm">299</a>).<p>Blessed by Jehovah is the land of Joseph, from the precious things of heaven, from the dew, even from the deep lying below, and from the precious things of the products of the sun, from the precious things produced of months, and from the precious things of the land and the fullness thereof, let it come upon the head of Joseph. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13-17</a>.<p>By those 'precious things' are signified the cognitions of good and truth, out of which doctrine [is derived].<p>Who drink out of goblets of wine, and are not affected with grief over the breaking up of Joseph, <a href="3927/amos_6_5.htm">Amos 6:5-6</a>.<p>I will make the house of Judah powerful, and I will save the house of Joseph, they shall be like the powerful Ephraim, and their heart shall rejoice as with wine, <a href="3927/zechariah_10_6.htm">Zechariah 10:6-7</a>.<p>Here also 'Joseph' [stands] for doctrine, 'wine' signifying the truth thereof out of good (<a href="316.htm">316</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 360</h4><p>360. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand, signifies the doctrine of good and truth with those who will be of the Lord's New Heaven and New Church. By "Joseph" is signified the Lord as to the spiritual Divine, in the spiritual sense, the spiritual kingdom; and, in the natural sense, fructification and multiplication; but by "Joseph" is here signified the doctrine of good and truth, which is with those who are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom. Joseph here has this signification, because he is named after the tribe of Zebulon, and before the tribe of Benjamin, thus in the middle; and the tribe which is first named in a series or class, signifies some love which is of the will; and the tribe which is named after it signifies something of wisdom which is of the understanding; and the tribe which is named last signifies some use or effect derived from them. Thus each series is full. As Joseph signifies the Lord's spiritual kingdom, therefore he was made ruler in Egypt, (<a href="3927/genesis_41_38.htm">Genesis 41:38-44</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_105_17.htm">Psalm 105:17-22</a>); where each particular signifies such things as are of the Lord's spiritual kingdom. The spiritual kingdom is the Lord's royalty; and the celestial kingdom is His priesthood.</p><p>[2] "Joseph," here signifies the doctrine of good and truth, because he is here in the place of Ephraim; and by "Ephraim" is signified the intellectual of the church; see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, (<a href="79.htm">79</a>); and the intellectual of the church is all from the doctrine of good and truth from the Word. The reason why Joseph is here in the place of Ephraim, is because Manasseh, who was Joseph's other son, and signified the voluntary of the church, was before reckoned among the tribes, (<a href="355.htm">355</a>). The intellectual of the church being derived from the doctrine of good and truth, therefore that intellectual, and also that doctrine, are signified by "Joseph" in the following passages:<p>Joseph is the son of a fruitful one, even a fruitful one near a fountain; in the strength of his bow he shall sit; he shall be blessed with the blessings of heaven from above, and with the blessings of the deep that lieth below, (<a href="3927/genesis_49_22.htm">Genesis 49:22-26</a>).<p>"A fountain" signifies the Word, and "a bow" doctrine, (<a href="299.htm">299</a>).<p>Blessed of Jehovah is the land of Joseph, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep lying below; and for the precious things of the products of the sun, and for the precious things of the products of the moons, and for the precious things of the earth and its fulness; let it come upon the head of Joseph, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13-17</a>).<p>By "the precious things" are signified the knowledges of good and truth, from which is doctrine:<p>Who drink from bowls of wine, and are not grieved for the breaking of Joseph, (<a href="3927/amos_6_6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>).<p>And I will make the house of Judah powerful, and I will save the house of Joseph; and they shall be like mighty Ephraim, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine, (<a href="3927/zechariah_10_6.htm">Zechariah 10:6-7</a> Here also "Joseph" signifies doctrine, and "wine," the truth of it from good, (<a href="316.htm">316</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 360 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>360. "Ex tribu Josephi duodecim millia signati," significat Doctrinam boni et veri, apud illos qui e Novo Caelo et e Nova Ecclesia Domini erunt. - Per "Josephum" (in Sensu supremo) significatur Dominus quoad Divinum Spirituale, in Sensu spirituali Regnum spirituale, et in Sensu naturali Fructificatio et Multiplicatio; hic autem per "Josephum" significatur Doctrina boni et veri, quae est apud illos qui in Regno spirituali Domini sunt; haec significatur hic per "Josephum," quia nominatur post tribum Sebulonis, et ante tribum Benjaminis, ita in medio; ac tribus quae primum nominatur in serie seu classe, significat aliquem amorem qui est voluntatis, et tribus quae postea nominatur significat aliquid sapientiae quod est intellectus, et tribus quae postremo nominatur significat aliquem usum seu effectum ex illis: inde est unaquaquaevis series plena. Quoniam Josephus Regnum spirituale Domini significabat, ideo factus est Dominator in Aegypto, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_360/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_41_38-44" target=_top>Genesis 41:38-44</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_360/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_105_17-22" target=_top>Psalm 105:17-22</a>, <sup>1</sup>ubi singula significant talia quae Regni spiritualis Domini sunt. Regnum Spirituale est Regium Domini, et Regnum Caeleste est Sacerdotium Ipsius. Quod "Josephus" hic significet Doctrinam boni et veri, est quia ille hic loco Ephraimi est, et per "Ephraimum" significatur Intellectuale Ecclesiae, videatur Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_360/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_79" target=_top>79</a>); et Intellectuale Ecclesiae est omne ex Doctrina boni et veri e Verbo: quod Josephus loco Ephraimi hic sit, est quia Menasse, qui erat alter filius Josephi, et significabat Voluntarium Ecclesiae, prius inter Tribus assumptus est (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_360/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_355" target=_top>355</a>). Quia Intellectuale Ecclesiae est ex Doctrina boni et veri, idea Intellectuale illud et quoque Doctrina illa per "Josephum" significatur in sequentibus locis: <p>"Filius fecundae Josephus, fecundae juxta fontem; sedebit in valido arcus sui; benedicetur ei benedictionibus Caeli desuper, et benedictionibus abyssi jacentis infra," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_360/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_49_22-26" target=_top>Genesis 49:22-26</a>);<p>"fons" significat Verbum, et "arcus" doctrinam (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_360/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_299" target=_top>299</a>).<p>"Benedicta a Jehovah sit terra Josephi, de pretiosis Caeli, de rore, de abysso etiam jacente infra, et de pretiosis proventuum solis, de pretiosis producti mensium, et de pretiosis terrae et plenitudinis ejus; veniat capiti Josephi," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_360/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_33_13-17" target=_top>Deuteronomius 33:13-17</a>);<p>per "pretiosa" illa significantur cognitiones boni et veri, ex quibus doctrina. <p>Qui "bibunt ex scyphis vini, et super confractione Josephi non afficiuntur dolore," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_360/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_amos_6_6" target=_top>Amos 6:6</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>"Potentem faciam domum Jehudae, et domum Josephi salvabo: hinc erunt sicut potens Ephraim, et laetabitur cor eorum sicut vino," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_360/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_10_6-7" target=_top>Sacharias 10:6-7</a>).<p>Hic quoque "Josephus" pro Doctrina; "vinum" significat Verum ejus ex bono (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_360/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_316" target=_top>316</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;22 pro "23"<p>2.&nbsp;6 pro "5, 6" </p>
