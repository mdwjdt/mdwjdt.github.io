<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第912节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>912.“城是精金的，如同明净的玻璃”表因而新教会的全部就是与来自主出于天堂的光一起流入的爱之良善。“城”或“耶路撒冷”表示就其内在的一切事物，或墙里面的一切事物而言，主的新教会。稍后会看到，“金”表示来自主的爱之良善；“如同明净的玻璃”表示因神性智慧而透明，并且由于神性智慧在天上显为光，从为太阳的主那里流入，故“如同明净的玻璃”表示连同来自天堂和主的光一起流入。前面（<a href="908.htm">908</a>节）说天堂和教会的一切事物皆来自爱之良善，并且爱之良善皆来自主；现在此处说“城是精金的”，以此表示新教会，也就是新耶路撒冷的全部都是来自主的爱之良善；但由于爱之良善无法单独，或从智慧之真理中抽取出来被赐予，所以为叫它能成为爱之良善，它必须成形，并且通过智慧之真理成形；因此，此处说城“如同明净的玻璃”；事实上，爱之良善离了智慧真理，没有任何性质可言，因为它没有任何形式，其形式取决于按其次序，以及与来自主的爱之良善的联结所流入的真理，因而它照接受情况而在人里面。说它在人里面，不要误以为它属于此人，其实它属于这人里面的主。由此明显可知，“城是精金的，如同明净的玻璃”表因而新教会的全部就是与来自主出于天堂的光一起流入的爱之良善。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 912</h4><p>912. And the city was pure gold, like clear glass. This symbolically means that everything connected with the New Church therefore embodies the goodness of love flowing in together with light out of heaven from the Lord.<p>The city, that is, Jerusalem, means the Lord's New Church in respect to everything in it or within its wall. Gold symbolizes the goodness of love from the Lord, as will be seen next. Being like clear glass symbolizes its having Divine wisdom shining clearly through; and because that wisdom appears in heaven as light and flows in from the Lord as the sun, being like pure glass symbolizes its flowing in together with light out of heaven from the Lord.<p>In no. <a href="908.htm">908</a> above we showed that everything connected with heaven and the church springs from the goodness of love, and that the goodness of love comes from the Lord. Now we say here that the city's looking as though it were pure gold means, symbolically, that everything connected with the New Church, the New Jerusalem, embodies the goodness of love from the Lord. Yet because the goodness of love does not exist by itself, divorced from the truths of wisdom, but for it to be the goodness of love must take form and does take form through truths of wisdom, therefore the city is said here to be pure gold, like clear glass. For the goodness of love without truths of wisdom does not have any character, because it lacks form. Its form accords with the truths it has flowing in in their order and connection together with the goodness of love from the Lord, thus in accord with its reception in a person. We say, in a person, but we mean not that the truths are a person's, but that they are the Lord's in him.<p>It is apparent from this now that the city's being pure gold, like clear glass, symbolically means that everything connected with the New Church therefore embodies the goodness of love flowing in with light out of heaven from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 912</h4><p>912. 'And the city was pure gold like unto pure glass' signifies that consequently everything of that Church is the good of love inflowing together with light out of heaven from the Lord. By 'the city,' or Jerusalem, is understood the Lord's New Church as to everything thereof regarded interiorly, or inside the wall. By 'gold' is signified the good of love from the Lord, concerning which [something] follows; and by 'like unto pure glass' is signified being transparent by virtue of Divine Wisdom, and because this appears in heaven as light and inflows from the Lord as the Sun, by 'like unto pure glass' is signified inflowing together with light out of heaven from the Lord. It has been shown above (<a href="908.htm">908</a>) that all the things of heaven and the Church are derived from the good of love, and the good of love is derived from the Lord. Now it is said here that the city was seen as 'pure glass,' by which is signified that everything of the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, is the good of love from the Lord; but because the good of love is not given on its own or alienated from the truths of wisdom, but so that the good of love may exist it must be formed, and it is formed by means of the truths of wisdom, therefore it is here said 'pure gold like unto pure glass.' For the good of love without the truths of wisdom does not have any quality, because there is no form, and its form is in accordance with its truths in their own order and connection inflowing together with the good of love from the Lord, thus in a man in accordance with the reception. It is said 'in a man,' but it is understood not as 'of the man' but as 'of the Lord in him.' From these considerations it is now plain that by 'the city was pure gold like unto pure glass' is signified that consequently everything of that Church is the good of love inflowing together with light out of heaven from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 912</h4><p>912. And the city was pure gold like unto pure glass, signifies that thence everything of that church is the good of love flowing in together with light out of heaven from the Lord. By "the city," or Jerusalem, is meant the Lord's New Church as to everything of it interiorly regarded, or within the wall. By "gold" is signified the good of love from the Lord, as will be seen presently; and "like unto pure glass" signifies pellucid from the Divine wisdom, and since the latter appears in heaven as light, and flows in from the Lord as a sun, by "like unto pure glass" is signified flowing in together with light from heaven and the Lord. It is shown above, (<a href="908.htm">908</a>), that all things of heaven and the church are from the good of love, and that the good of love is from the Lord; here it is now said, that the city was seen as "pure gold," by which is signified that the all of the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, is the good of love from the Lord; but since the good of love is not given solitary or abstracted from the truths of wisdom, but that it may be the good of love, it must be formed, and it is formed by the truths of wisdom, therefore it is here said "pure gold like unto pure glass;" for the good of love without the truths of wisdom has not any quality, because it has not any form, and its form is according to its truths flowing in in their order and connection together with the good of love from the Lord, thus it is in man according to reception. It is said in man, but it is to be understood not as being of the man, but as of the Lord in him. From these things, then, it is plain, that by "the city was pure gold like unto pure glass," is signified that thence the all of that church is the good of love flowing in with light from heaven from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 912 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>912. "Et urbs aurum purum simile vitro puro," significat quod inde omne Ecclesiae illius sit bonum amoris influens una cum luce e Caelo a Domino. -Per "urbem," seu Hierosolymam, intelligitur Nova Domini Ecclesia quoad omne ejus interius, seu intra murum spectata; per "aurum" significatur bonum amoris a Domino, de quo sequitur; et per "simile vitro puro" significatur pellucens ex Divina Sapientia; et quia haec apparet in Caelo ut lux, et influit a Domino ut Sole, per "simile vitro puro" significatur influens una cum luce e Caelo a Domino. Supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_912/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_908" target=_top>908</a>) ostensum est, quod omnia Caeli et Ecclesiae sint ex bono amoris, et bonum amoris ex Domino; hic nunc dicitur quod urbs visa sit ut "aurum purum;" per quod significatur, quod omne Ecclesiae novae, quae est Nova Hierosolyma, sit bonum amoris a Domino; sed quia bonum amoris solitarium seu abstractum a veris sapientiae non datur, sed ut sit bonum amoris erit formatum, et formatur per vera sapientiae, ideo hic dicitur "aurum purum simile vitro puro:" bonum enim amoris absque veris sapientiae non habet aliquod quale, quia non aliquam formam, et forma ejus est secundum vera ejus in suo ordine et nexu influentia una cum bono amoris a Domino, ita in homine secundum receptionem. Dicitur in homine, sed intelligitur non ut hominis, sed ut Domini in illo. Ex his nunc patet, quod per "urbs aurum purum simile vitro puro" significetur quod inde omne Ecclesiae illius sit bonum amoris influens cum luce e Caelo a Domino. </p>
