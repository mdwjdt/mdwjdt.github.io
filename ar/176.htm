<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第176节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>176.“看哪，我在你面前给你一个敞开的门”表天堂向那些通过主处于源自良善的真理之人敞开。显然，“敞开的门”表允许进入。经上之所以说这门向那些属非拉铁非教会的人敞开，是因为该教会表那些通过主处于源自良善的真理之人，主向他们敞开天堂。关于这个问题，让我透露一些前所未知的信息。唯独主是天地之神（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">28:18</a>），所以，不直接靠近主的人看不见通向天堂的路，也找不到天堂之门，即便偶尔被允许靠近，这门也会关闭，就是敲门，门也不开。灵界确实有通往天堂的路，并且到处都有门。凡被主引入天堂的人，都会踏上通往天堂的路，从这些门进入。灵界有道路，这一点可见于《天堂与地狱》（<a href="../hh/479.htm">479</a>，<a href="../hh/534.htm">534</a>，<a href="../hh/590.htm">590</a>节）一书；还有门（<a href="../hh/429.htm">429</a>-430，<a href="../hh/583.htm">583</a>-584节）。因为在诸天堂所看到的一切事物都是对应，道路与门也不例外。道路对应真理，因此表示真理；门对应允许进入，因此表示允许进入。</p><p>由于唯独主将人引入天堂，打开天堂之门，所以祂称自己为“道路”，以及“门”，在约翰福音中被称为“道路”：</p><p>我就是道路，真理，生命。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>）</p><p>在同一福音中被称为“门”：</p><p>我就是羊的门，凡从我进来的，必然得救。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.9.htm">10:9</a>）</p><p>由于灵界既有路也有门，天使灵也确实踏上这些道路，从门进入天堂，故圣言频繁提到“门”、“城门”和“门户”，以此表示入口。如以下经文：</p><p>众城门哪，你们要抬起头来！这世界的门户啊，要举起来，那荣耀的王将要进来。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗24.7.htm">24:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗24.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>敞开城门，使守信的公义民族进来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛26.2.htm">26:2</a>）</p><p>五个聪明童女进去赴婚筵，门就关了；五个愚拙的童女来敲门，门却未开。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.10.htm">25:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>耶稣说，你们要努力进窄门，将来有许多人寻求进去，却是不能。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.24.htm">13:24</a>等）</p><p>由于“门”表入口，“新耶路撒冷”表由那些通过主处于源自良善的真理之人所组成的教会，所以经上描述新耶路撒冷说，它的门上有天使，还说城门不关闭（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.12.htm">21:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.25.htm">25</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 176</h4><p>176. "'See, I have set before you an open door.'" (<a href="3927/revelation_3_8.htm">3:8</a>) This symbolically means that to those who are governed by truths springing from goodness derived from the Lord, heaven is opened.<p>An open door clearly symbolizes an entryway. The door is said to be open for people who belong to the church in Philadelphia because people governed by truths springing from goodness derived from the Lord are meant by that church, and to them the Lord opens heaven.<p>But on this subject we will say something previously not known: The Lord alone is God of heaven and earth (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>), <sup>1</sup>and consequently people who do not go to Him directly do not see the way to heaven and therefore do not find the door. If by chance they are permitted to approach it, it is closed, and if someone knocks, it is not opened.<p>In the spiritual world there are actually paths that lead to heaven, and here and there one finds gates. People who are being led by the Lord to heaven go along paths that lead to it, and they enter through the gates. The existence of paths in that world may be seen in the book Heaven and Hell, nos. <a href="../hh/479.htm">479</a> <a href="../hh/534.htm">534</a>, <a href="../hh/590.htm">590</a>, and also gates, nos. <a href="429.htm">429</a>, <a href="430.htm">430</a>, <a href="583.htm">583</a>, <a href="584.htm">584</a>. For everything seen in the heavens is a correspondent form, and so, too, are paths and gates. Paths, indeed, correspond to truths and consequently symbolize them, and gates correspond to an entryway and so symbolize it.</p><p>[2] Since the Lord alone leads a person to heaven and opens the door, therefore He calls Himself the way and also the door - the way in John,<p>I am the way, the truth, and the life. (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>)<p>And in the same gospel the door,<p>I am the door of the sheep... If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved... (<a href="3927/john_10_7.htm">John 10:7</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">9</a>)<p>Since both ways and doors exist in the spiritual world, and angelic spirits actually travel along those ways or paths and enter through doors when they enter into heaven, therefore doors and gates are often mentioned in the Word, and they symbolize an entryway, as in the following passages:<p>Lift up your heads, O you gates! Lift up, you doors of the world! That the King of glory may come in. (<a href="3927/psalms_24_7.htm">Psalms 24:7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_24_9.htm">9</a>)<p>Open the gates, that the righteous nation which exercises faithfulness may enter in. (<a href="3927/isaiah_26_2.htm">Isaiah 26:2</a>)<p>(The five wise virgins) went in... to the wedding, and the door was shut. (Then the five foolish virgins came and knocked, but it was not opened.) (<a href="3927/matthew_25_10.htm">Matthew 25:10-12</a>)<p>(Jesus said,) "Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for many... will seek to enter and will not be able. (<a href="3927/luke_13_24.htm">Luke 13:24-25</a>)<p>And so also elsewhere.<p>Because a door symbolizes an entryway, and the New Jerusalem symbolizes a church formed of people who are governed by truths springing from goodness derived from the Lord, therefore the New Jerusalem is described also in respect to its gates, with angels upon them, and they are said to be not shut (<a href="3927/revelation_21_12.htm">Revelation 21:12-13</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_25.htm">25</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth." (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 176</h4><p>176. 'Behold, I have set before thee an open door' signifies that heaven has been opened to those who are in truths derived out of good from the Lord. It is plain that by 'an open door' is signified admission. The door is said to be open to those who belong to the Church in Philadelphia, because by that Church are understood those who are in truths derived out of good from the Lord, and the Lord opens heaven to them. But on this matter something not previously known shall be said. The Only Lord is the God of heaven and earth (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>); those therefore who do not approach Him directly do not see the way to heaven, nor consequently do they see the door, and if perchance they are allowed to reach it, it is shut, and not opened by knocking. In the spiritual world there actually are ways that lead to heaven, and here and there are gates, and those who are led by the Lord to heaven go along the ways leading thither, and enter through the gates. That there are ways there may be seen in the work concerning <a href="../hh/479.htm">HEAVEN AND HELL 479</a>, <a href="../hh/534.htm">534</a>, <a href="../hh/590.htm">590</a>; and gates also <a href="../hh/429.htm">429-430</a>, <a href="../hh/583.htm">583-584</a>; for all the things that are observed in the heavens are correspondences, consequently also the ways and the gates; for ways correspond to truths, and consequently signify them, and gates correspond to entry, and consequently signify that.</p><p>[2] Since the Only Lord leads a man to heaven, and opens the door, He therefore calls Himself 'the Way' and also 'the Door'; 'the Way' in John:<p>I am the Way, the Truth (veritas), and the Life. <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>.<p>'The Door' in the same [gospel]:<p>I am the door of the sheep; by Me if any one enters in, he shall be saved. <a href="3927/john_10_7.htm">John 10:7</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">9</a>.<p>Since there are both ways and doors in the spiritual world, and angelic spirits actually go along the ways, and enter through the doors while going into heaven, therefore 'doors,' 'gates,' and 'entrances' are frequently mentioned in the Word, and by them entry is signified, as in these places:<p>Lift up your heads, O gates, lift them up, O doors of the world, that the King of glory may come in <a href="3927/psalms_24_7.htm">Psalms 24:7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_24_9.htm">9</a>.<p>Open the gates, that the just nation practising fidelities (faciens fidetitates) may enter in <a href="3927/isaiah_26_2.htm">Isaiah 26:2</a>.<p>The five prudent virgins went in to the wedding, and the door was shut; and the five foolish virgins came and knocked, but it was not opened. <a href="3927/matthew_25_10.htm">Matthew 25:10-12</a>.<p>Jesus said, Strive to enter in through the strait gate, for many will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. <a href="3927/luke_13_24.htm">Luke 13:24-25</a>, besides elsewhere. Since a 'door' signifies entry, and 'the New Jerusalem' signifies the Church [formed] from those who are in truths derived out of good from the Lord, therefore the New Jerusalem also is described as to 'gates,' upon which are angels, and it is said that they shall not be shut (<a href="3927/revelation_21_12.htm">Revelation 21:12-13</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_25.htm">25</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 176</h4><p>176. Behold, I have set before thee an open door, signifies that heaven is open to those who are in truths from good from the Lord. That by "an open door" is signified admission, is evident. The door is said to be open to those who are of the church in Philadelphia, because by that church are meant those who are in truths from good from the Lord, and to them the Lord opens heaven. But on this subject something not before known shall be declared. The Lord alone is the God of heaven and earth, (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>); they therefore who do not directly approach Him, cannot see the way to heaven, nor can they find the door, and if haply they are permitted to approach it, it is shut, and if they knock it is not opened. In the spiritual world there are actually ways which lead to heaven, and there are here and there gates, and they who are led to heaven by the Lord, take the ways which lead thither, and enter through the gates. That there are ways there, may be seen in the work concerning Heaven and Hell, (<a href="479.htm">479</a>, <a href="534.htm">534</a>, <a href="590.htm">590</a>); and also gates, (<a href="429.htm">429-430</a>, <a href="583.htm">583-584</a>). For all things which are seen in the heavens are correspondences, thus also, ways and gates; for ways correspond to truths, and thence signify them, and gates correspond to admission, and thence signify it.</p><p>[2] Since the Lord alone leads man to heaven, and opens the door, therefore He calls Himself "the way" and also "the door": "the way" in John:<p>I am the way, the truth, and the life, (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p>The door in the same Evangelist:<p>I am the door of the sheep, by Me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved, (<a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">John 10:9</a>). (<a href="3927/john_10_7.htm">John 10:7</a>) (<a href="3927/john_10_9.htm">John 10:9</a>)<p>Since there are both ways and doors in the spiritual world, and angelic spirits actually go in those ways, and enter into heaven by doors, therefore "doors," "gates," and "portals" are frequently mentioned in the Word, by which is signified entrance; as in these places:<p>Lift up your heads, O ye gates, lift them up, ye doors of the world, and the King of Glory shall come in, (<a href="3927/psalms_24_7.htm">Psalms 24:7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_24_9.htm">9</a>).<p>Open ye the gates, that the just nation, which doeth fidelity, may enter in, (<a href="3927/isaiah_26_2.htm">Isaiah 26:2</a>).<p>The five prudent virgins went in to the wedding, and the door was shut; and the five foolish virgins came and knocked, but it was not opened, (<a href="3927/matthew_25_10.htm">Matthew 25:10-12</a>).<p>Jesus said, Strive to enter in at the straight gate, for many will seek to enter in, and shall not be able, (<a href="3927/luke_13_24.htm">Luke 13:24</a> besides others).<p>Since "a door" signifies entrance, and "the New Jerusalem" signifies the church consisting of those who are in truths from good from the Lord, therefore the New Jerusalem is described also as to "its gates, upon which there were angels," and it is said, They should not be shut, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_12.htm">Revelation 21:12-13</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_25.htm">25</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 176 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>176. "Ecce dedi coram te ostium apertum," significat quod illis qui in veris ex bono a Domino sunt, Caelum apertum sit. - Quod per "ostium apertum" significetur intromissio, patet: quod illis, qui ab Ecclesia in Philadelphia sunt, dicatur ostium esse apertum, est quia per eam Ecclesiam intelliguntur in veris ex bono a Domino sunt, et Dominus aperit illis Caelum. Sed de hac re aliquid non prius notum dicetur: Solus Dominus est Deus Caeli et Terrae, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_176/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_28_18" target=_top>Matthaeus 28:18</a>); quare qui non Ipsum directe adeunt, non vident viam ad Caelum, et inde nec inveniunt januam, et si forte ad illam admittuntur, est illa clausa, et pulsanti non aperitur.
