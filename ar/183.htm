<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第183节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>183.“看哪，我要使他们来在你脚前下拜”表那些在教义上处于虚假的人只要不处于源自邪恶的虚假，就会接受并承认新教会的真理。这话是指着那些属“撒但会堂，自称是犹太人，其实不是，乃是说谎话的的”说的，他们表示那些在教义上处于虚假，但并非处于源自邪恶的虚假，只是在教义上处于虚假，在生活上却处于良善的人。当听闻真理时，接受并承认它们的，是后者，而非前者。原因在于，良善热爱真理，源自良善的真理弃绝虚假。“来在你脚前下拜”表示接受并承认真理；当然，不是在他们脚前下拜，而是在主脚前下拜，因为他们从主接受源自良善的真理。因此，在以下经文，“脚前下拜”也同样的含义：</p><p>你们当尊崇耶和华我们的主，在祂脚凳前下拜。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗99.5.htm">99:5</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 183</h4><p>183. "'Behold, I will make them come and worship at your feet.'" This symbolically means that those who are caught up in falsities as regards doctrine, provided they are not falsities springing from evil, will accept the truths of the New Church and acknowledge them.<p>This is said of those people who are of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, but lie, and they mean people caught up in falsities as regards doctrine, yet not in falsities springing from evil, but in falsities as regards doctrine while impelled by good as to life. These, and not people caught up in falsities springing from evil, accept and acknowledge truths when they hear them. That is because goodness loves truth, and truth in accord with goodness rejects falsity. To accept and acknowledge truths is what is symbolically meant by coming and worshiping at the feet - not at their feet, but at the feet of the Lord, from whom they have truths that accord with good. A similar symbolic meaning as the one here occurs, therefore, in this verse in the Psalms:<p>Worship Jehovah our God, worship at His footstool. (<a href="3927/psalms_99_5.htm">Psalms 99:5</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 183</h4><p>183. 'Behold I will make them to come and worship at thy feet' signifies that those who as to doctrine are in untruths, provided they are not in untruths derived from evil, are going to receive the truths of the New Church, and acknowledge them. This is said of those who are 'out of the synagogue of Satan, and declare themselves to be Jews, and are not, but do lie,' by whom are understood those who are in untruths as to doctrine but yet not in untruths derived from evil, in untruths as to doctrine indeed, but in good as to life. The latter, and not the former, receive and acknowledge truths when they hear them. This is because good loves truth, while truth derived from good rejects untruth. To receive and acknowledge truths is signified by 'come and worship at thy feet'; not at their feet, but at the feet of the Lord, from Whom they have the truths derived from good. Something similar to this is signified by these [words] in David:<p>Worship Jehovah our God, worship at His footstool. <a href="3927/psalms_99_5.htm">Psalms 99:5</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 183</h4><p>183. Behold, I will make them to come and adore at thy feet, signifies that those who are in falsities as to doctrine, provided they are not in falsities from evil, will receive and acknowledge the truths of the New Church. This is said of those who are of "the synagogue of Satan, and say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie," by whom are meant those who are in falsities as to doctrine, yet not in falsities from evil, but in falsities as to doctrine but in good as to life. The latter, and not the former, receive and acknowledge truths when they hear them. The reason is, that good loves truth, and truth from good rejects what is false. To receive and acknowledge truths is signified by "coming and adoring at thy feet;" not at their feet, but at the feet of the Lord, from whom they have the truths from good; therefore the following passage in David has a like signification:<p>Adore Jehovah our Lord, adore at His footstool, (<a href="3927/psalms_99_5.htm">Psalms 99:5</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 183 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>183. "Ecce faciam ut illi veniant et adorent ad pedes tuos," significat quod illi qui in falsis quoad doctrinam sunt, modo non sint in falsis ex malo, recepturi sint vera Novae Ecclesiae et agnituri. - Hoc dicitur de illis, qui e "synagoga satanae" sunt, et "dicunt se esse Judaeos, et non sunt, sed mentiuntur;" per quos intelliguntur qui in falsis quoad doctrinam sunt, sed usque non in falsis ex malo, verum in falsis quoad doctrinam sed in bono quoad vitam; hi et non illi recipiunt et agnoscunt vera cum audiunt illa; causa est, quia bonum amat verum, ac verum ex bono rejicit falsum; recipere et agnoscere vera, significatur per "venire et adorare ad pedes;" non ad pedes illorum, sed ad pedes Domini, a Quo illis vera ex bono sunt; quare simile, quod hic, significatur per haec apud Davidem: <p>"Adorate Jehovam Deum nostrum, adorate ad scabellum pedum Ipsius," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_183/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_99_5" target=_top>Psalm 99:5</a>). </p>
