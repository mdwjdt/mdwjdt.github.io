<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第834节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>834.启19:20.“那兽被擒拿，那在兽面前曾行奇事、迷惑受兽印记和拜兽像之人的假先知，也与他同被擒拿”表所有那些信奉唯信、内在邪恶的人，无论平信徒还是普通百姓，以及那些通过推理和证明唯信是得救的唯一途径而迷惑其他人接受这信，并照之生活的神职人员和有学问的人。“兽”在此是指前面所说的“从海中上来的兽”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.1.htm">13:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.10.htm">10</a>）；“假先知”是指前面所说的“从地中上来的兽”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.11.htm">13:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.18.htm">18</a>）；“从海中上来的兽”是指陷入唯信宗教的平信徒和普通百姓，“从地中上来的兽”是指陷入该宗教的神职人员和有学问的人，这一点从那一章的解读可以看出来。显然，此处“假先知”是指那一章（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.11.htm">13:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.18.htm">18</a>）所说的“从地中上来的兽”；因为此处论到“假先知”说，正是他“在兽面前曾行奇事、迷惑受兽印记和拜兽像之人的”；那一章也有类似的话论及从地中上来的兽：</p><p>他在从海中上来的兽面前行大奇事，迷惑住在地上的人，叫他们拜兽像，在右手上，或是在额上受他的印记。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启 13.12.htm"> 13:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启 13.17.htm">17</a>）</p><p>由此明显可知，此处“假先知”表示神职人员和有学问的人，他们确认唯信的宗教，迷惑平信徒和普通百姓。他们之所以被称为“假先知”，是因为“假先知”表示那些通过歪曲圣言的真理教导和宣讲虚假的人（<a href="8.htm">8</a>，<a href="701.htm">701</a>节）。那兽所行的“奇事”表示对唯信是得救唯一途径的推理和证明（参看<a href="598.htm">598</a>，<a href="599.htm">599</a>，<a href="704.htm">704</a>节）。“受兽印记和拜兽像”表示承认并接受唯信（<a href="634.htm">634</a>，<a href="637.htm">637</a>，<a href="679.htm">679</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 834</h4><p>834. <a href="3927/revelation_19_20.htm">19:20</a> Then the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who worked signs in its presence, by which he led astray those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. This symbolizes all those people who professed faith alone and were inwardly evil, both the laity and common people and the clergy and the learned, who by arguments and assertions that faith alone is the only means of salvation, had brought others to accept that faith and to live in accordance with it.<p>The beast here means the beast from the sea, described in <a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1-10</a>, and the false prophet means the beast from the earth, described in the same chapter, verses <a href="3927/revelation_13_11.htm">11</a> to <a href="3927/revelation_13_18.htm">18</a>. The beast from the sea means the laity and common people who are caught up in a religion teaching faith alone, and the beast from the earth means the clergy and the learned who are caught up in that religion, as may be seen from the exposition of that chapter.<p>It is clearly apparent that the false prophet here is the beast from the earth, described in chapter <a href="3927/revelation_13_11.htm">13:11-18</a>, because we are told here that the false prophet worked signs in the presence of the other beast, by which he led astray those who received the mark of the beast and who worshiped its image. For the same thing is said about the beast from the earth in chapter <a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">13</a>, namely, that it performed great signs in the presence of the beast from the sea, and led astray those who dwell on the earth, so that they worshiped its image and received its mark on their right hand and on their foreheads (<a href="3927/revelation_13_12.htm">Revelation 13:12-17</a>). It is apparent from this that the false prophet here symbolizes the clergy and the learned who had confirmed themselves in a religion teaching faith alone and had led the laity and common people astray. They are called a false prophet, because a false prophet symbolizes people who teach and preach falsities by twisting the Word's truths (nos. <a href="8.htm">8</a>, <a href="701.htm">701</a>).<p>The signs done by this beast symbolize arguments and assertions that faith alone is the only means of salvation, as may be seen in nos. <a href="598.htm">598</a>, <a href="599.htm">599</a>, <a href="704.htm">704</a> above. To receive the mark of the beast and worship its image means, symbolically, to acknowledge and accept that faith (nos. <a href="634.htm">634</a>, <a href="637.htm">637</a>, <a href="679.htm">679</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 834</h4><p>834. [verse 20] 'And the beast was arrested and with him the false prophet who did signs before him, with which he led astray those accepting the mark of the beast and those adoring his image' signifies all those who made profession of faith alone and were interiorly evil, the laity and common people as well as the clergy and the learned, who by means of reasonings and entreaties [to the effect] that faith alone is the sole means of salvation led others to receiving that faith and living in accordance therewith. By 'the beast' here is understood 'the beast out of the sea' treated of in <a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1-10</a>; and by 'the false prophet' is understood 'the beast out of the land' treated of in the same chapter (verses 11-17). That by 'the beast out of the sea' are understood the laity and common people who are in the form of religion of faith alone, and that by 'the beast out of the land' are understood the clergy and the learned who are in that form of religion, can be seen from the expositions of that chapter. That 'the false prophet' here is 'the beast out of the land' of which it treats in that chapter (verses 11-18) is quite plain because it is said here of the false prophet that it is he 'who did signs before' the other beast 'with which he led astray those accepting the mark of the beast and those adoring his image.' For similar things are said of 'the beast of the land' (chapter xiii) namely, that:<p>He did great signs before the beast out of the sea and led astray those dwelling upon the hand so that they might adore his image and accept his mark upon the right hand and upon the forehead (verses 12-17); from which it is plain that here by 'the false prophet' are signified the clergy and the learned who confirmed themselves in the form of religion of faith alone and led astray the laity and common people. They are called 'the false prophet' because by a 'prophet' are signified those who teach and preach untruths, perverting the truths of the Word (<a href="8.htm">8</a>, <a href="701.htm">701</a>). That by 'the signs' of that beast are signified reasonings and entreaties that faith alone is the sole means of salvation may be seen above (<a href="598.htm">598-599</a>, <a href="704.htm">704</a>). By 'to accept the mark of the beast and to adore his image' is signified to acknowledge and receive that faith (<a href="634.htm">634</a>, <a href="637.htm">637</a>, <a href="679.htm">679</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 834</h4><p>834. Verse 20. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet, that did signs before him, with which he seduced them that receive the mark of the beast and that adore his image, signifies all those who professed faith alone, and were interiorly evil, as well the laity and common people as the clergy and the learned, who by reasonings and attestations that faith alone is the only means of salvation, have induced others to receive that faith, and to live according to it. By "the beast" here is meant "the beast out of the sea," spoken of, (<a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1-10</a>); and by "the false prophet" is meant "the beast out of the earth," spoken of in the same chapter (verses <a href="3927/revelation_18_11.htm">11-18</a>). That by "the beast out of the sea" are meant the laity and the common people who are in the religious persuasion concerning faith alone, and that by "the beast out of the earth" are meant the clergy and the learned who are in that religious persuasion, may be seen from the explanations of that chapter. That "the false prophet" here is "the beast out of the earth," which is treated of in that chapter (verses <a href="3927/revelation_18_11.htm">11-18</a>11 is plainly manifest; because it is here said of "the false prophet," that it is "he that did signs before the other beast, with which he seduced them that receive the mark of the beast, and that adore his image:" for similar things are said of the beast out of the earth (chap. 13); namely, that:<p>He did great signs before the beast out of the sea, and seduced them that dwell upon the earth, that they should adore his image, and receive his mark upon the right hand and upon the forehead, (<a href="3927/revelation_13_12.htm">Revelation 13:12-17</a>):<p>from which it is manifest, that the clergy and the learned are here signified by "the false prophet," who have confirmed themselves in the religious persuasion concerning faith alone, and have seduced the laity and the common people. They are called the false prophet, because by "a prophet" those are signified who teach and preach falsities by perverting the truths of the Word, (<a href="8.htm">8</a>, <a href="701.htm">701</a>). That by "the signs" of that beast are signified reasonings and attestations that faith alone is the only means of salvation, may be seen above, (<a href="598.htm">598</a>, <a href="599.htm">599</a>, <a href="704.htm">704</a>). By "receiving the mark of the beast and adoring his image" is signified to acknowledge and receive that faith, (<a href="634.htm">634</a>, <a href="637.htm">637</a>, <a href="679.htm">679</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 834 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>834. (Vers. 20.) "Et comprehensa est Bestia, at cum illa Pseudopropheta qui facit signa coram illa, quibus seduxit accipientes characterem Bestiae, at adorantes imaginem ejus," significat omnes illos qui professi sunt solam Fidem, ac interius mali erant, tam Laici et vulgus quam Clerici et docti, qui per ratiocinationes et contestationes quod sola Fides sit unicum medium salutis, adduxerunt alios ad recipiendum illam fidem, et ad vivendum secundum illam. - Per "Bestiam" hic intelligitur "Bestia e mari" (de qua <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_834/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_13_1-10" target=_top>Apocalypsis 13:1-10</a>); et per "Pseudoprophetam" intelligitur "Bestia e terra" (de qua in eodem capite, a vers. 11 ad 18). <sup>1</sup>Quod per "Bestiam e mari" intelligantur laici et vulgus, qui in Religioso de sola Fide sunt, et quod per "Bestiam e terra" intelligantur clerici et docti qui in illo Religioso sunt, videri potest ab Explicationibus illius capitis: quod "Pseudopropheta" hic sit "Bestia e terra" (de qua in eo capite, a vers. 11 ad 18, agitur), patet manifeste; quia dicitur hic de "Pseudopropheta," quod sit "qui fecit signa coram altera Bestia, quibus seduxit accipientes characterem Bestiae et adorantes imaginem ejus;" nam similia dicuntur de "Bestia e terra," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_834/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_13_1-18" target=_top>13</a>), nempe, quod "Fecerit signa magna coram Bestia e mari, et seduxerit habitantes super terra, ut adorarent imaginem ejus, et acciperent characterem ejus super manu dextra et super fronte," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_834/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_13_12-17" target=_top>Apocalypsis 13:12-17</a>);<p>ex quibus patet, quod per "Pseudoprophetam" hic significentur clerici et docti, qui se confirmaverunt in Religioso de sola Fide, et seduxerunt laicos et vulgus; vocantur Pseudopropheta, quia per "(falsum) Prophetam" significantur qui docent et praedicant falsa, pervertendo vera Verbi (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_834/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_8" target=_top>8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_834/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_701" target=_top>701</a>); quod per "signa" ejus Bestiae significentur ratiocinationes et contestationes quod sola Fides sit unicum medium salutis, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_834/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_598" target=_top>598</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_834/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_599" target=_top>599</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_834/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_704" target=_top>704</a>) per "accipere characterem Bestiae et adorare imaginem ejus" significatur agnoscere et recipere illam fidem (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_834/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_634" target=_top>634</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_834/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_637" target=_top>637</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_834/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_679" target=_top>679</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;18 pro "12" </p>
