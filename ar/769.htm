<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第769节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>769.启18:10.“因怕她的痛苦，就远远地站着说，祸哉，祸哉，巴比伦大城，大有势力的城阿，一时之间你的审判就来到了”表他们对惩罚的恐惧，以及那时对如此坚固的天主教竟突然之间被彻底推翻，并且他们会灭亡的极度悲伤。“因怕她的痛苦，就远远地站着”表示距离那些受罚之人的状态尚为遥远的一种状态，因为他们害怕受痛苦，这一点将在下文予以解释。“祸哉，祸哉”表示极度悲伤。“祸哉”表示对灾难、不幸或受罚的悲伤（参看<a href="416.htm">416</a>节）；因此，“祸哉，祸哉”表示极度悲伤悲哀。“巴比伦大城”表示天主教；在此和前面一样（<a href="751.htm">751</a>节），“巴比伦”之所以为妇人或淫妇，是因为所论述的是“她的痛苦”。“大有势力的城”表示如此坚固的宗教。“一时之间你的审判就来到了”表示它如此突然被彻底推翻，并且他们会灭亡。“一时之间”表示如此突然；“审判”表示推翻和毁灭那些与此处所论述的淫妇“行淫并一同奢华”的人。他们因最后的审判而灭亡，这一事实可见于1758年于伦敦出版的《最后的审判》这本小书。那里说到有关他们毁灭的事。</p><p>“因怕她的痛苦，就远远地站着说”之所以表示因害怕痛苦而距离那些受罚之人的状态尚为遥远的一种状态，是因为“远远地”不是指空间距离上的遥远，而是指当人害怕惩罚时的状态上的遥远；事实上，只要人处于害怕的状态，他就会观望、权衡和悲伤。圣言别处的“远”也表示状态的遥远，也就是灵义上的遥远；如以下经文：</p><p>你们远方的人当听我所要行的；你们近处的人当知道我的大能。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 33.13.htm"> 33:13</a>）</p><p>我岂为近处的神呢？不也为远处的神吗？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 23.23.htm"> 23:23</a>）</p><p>他曾在旷野蒙恩，以色列说，从远方，耶和华向我显现。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.2.htm">31:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.3.htm">3</a>）</p><p>将我的众子从远方带来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.6.htm">43:6</a>）</p><p>远方的众民啊，留心而听。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.1.htm">49:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>从远方之地而来的众百姓和民族。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.26.htm">5:26</a>）</p><p>此外还有其它地方（如耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.16.htm">4:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.15.htm">6:15</a>；撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚6.15.htm">6:15</a>）；那里所说的“从远方来的民族和百姓”表示那些距离教会的真理和良善更为遥远的人。在日常用语中，关系亲密也被说成“近”，关系疏离则被说成“远”。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 769</h4><p>769. <a href="3927/revelation_18_10.htm">18:10</a> "Standing at a distance for fear of her torment, saying, 'Woe, woe, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! For in one hour your judgment has come.' " This symbolizes their fear of punishments, and grievous lamentation then that the Roman Catholic religion, so well fortified, could be so suddenly and completely overturned, and that they could perish.<p>To stand at a distance for fear of torment symbolizes a state as yet distant from the state of those in a state of damnation, because the people here have a fear of torment, of which we will say more below. "Woe, woe," symbolizes a grievous lamentation. "Woe" symbolizes a lamentation over a calamity, misfortune, or damnation, as may be seen in no. <a href="416.htm">416</a> above; "woe, woe," therefore symbolizes a grievous lamentation. The great city Babylon symbolizes the Roman Catholic religion, here Babylon as a woman or harlot as in no. <a href="751.htm">751</a> above, because the torment is said to be her torment. A mighty city symbolizes a religion so well fortified. "In one hour your judgment has come" means symbolically that it could be so suddenly overturned and that they could perish. "In one hour" means, symbolically, so suddenly, and its judgment symbolizes its overturn and the destruction of those who committed whoredom with her and delighted in her, who are the subject here. That they perished as a result of the Last Judgment may be seen in the short work, The Last Judgment and Babylon Destroyed (London, 1758). Their destruction is the subject of what is said here.</p><p>[2] We said that the kings' standing at a distance for fear of Babylon's torment symbolizes a state as yet distant from the state of those in a state of damnation, because the people here have a fear of torment, and the reason is that distance does not mean a spatial distance, but a distance of state when someone has a fear of being punished; for as a long as a person is in a state of fear, he then sees, considers, and laments. Distance of state, which is what distance is in the spiritual sense, is also symbolized by distance elsewhere in the Word, as in the following places:<p>Hear, you who are afar off, what I have done; and you who are near, acknowledge My might. (<a href="3927/isaiah_33_13.htm">Isaiah 33:13</a>)<p>Am I a God near at hand..., and not a God afar off? (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_23.htm">Jeremiah 23:23</a>)<p>It found grace in the wilderness... Israel (said)..., Jehovah appeared to me from afar... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_2.htm">Jeremiah 31:2-3</a>)<p>Bring My sons from afar... (<a href="3927/isaiah_43_6.htm">Isaiah 43:6</a>)<p>Attend, O peoples, from afar! (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_1.htm">Isaiah 49:1-2</a>)<p>(The peoples and nations that) come from a far land, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_4.htm">Isaiah 13:4-5</a>.<p>And so on elsewhere, as in <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_16.htm">Jeremiah 4:16</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_15.htm">5:15</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_6_15.htm">Zechariah 6:15</a>, where nations and peoples from afar mean people relatively distant from the truths and goods of the church.<p>In common speech, too, some relatives are said to be near relatives, and ones more remotely related are said to be distant relatives. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 769</h4><p>769. [verse 10] 'And standing afar off for fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, that great city Babylon, that powerful city, for in one hour thy judgment has come' signifies their fear of the penalties, and then a grievous lamentation that that form of religion, so fortified, could be overturned so suddenly and clearly, and they could perish. 'To stand afar off for fear of the torment' signifies a state as yet remote from the state of those who are in damnation because they are in fear of torment, concerning which it follows on. 'Woe, woe' signifies grievous lamentation. That 'woe' signifies lamentation over misfortune, unhappiness and damnation may be seen above (<a href="416.htm">416</a>), consequently 'Woe, woe' signifies a grievous lamentation. By the 'great city Babylon' is signified that form of religion; here as above (<a href="../ac/751.htm">Arcana Coelestia 751</a>), Babylon as a woman or harlot, because it is said 'her torment.' By the 'powerful city' is signified the form of religion so fortified. By 'in one hour thy judgment has come' is signified that it can be so suddenly overthrown, and they can perish. 'In one hour' signifies so suddenly, and by 'judgment' is signified its overthrow and the destruction of those who have committed whoredom and lived luxuriously with that harlot, who are here treated of. That they perished by means of the last judgment can be seen in the little work concerning THE LAST JUDGMENT AND BABYLON DESTROYED, published at London, 1758. The things here were said of that destruction.</p><p>[2] The reason that 'they stood afar off for fear of her torment' signifies a state as yet remote from the state of those who are in damnation because in fear of torment, is because by 'afar' is not understood remoteness of space but the remoteness of state when one is in fear of the penalties. For, so long as a man is in a state of fear, he then sees, ponders and laments. The remoteness of state, which is remoteness in the spiritual sense, is also signified by 'afar off' elsewhere in the Word, as in these instances:<p>Hear, you afar off, what I will do; and you near, recognise My vigour. <a href="3927/isaiah_33_13.htm">Isaiah 33:13</a>.<p>Am I God near by, and not God afar off? <a href="3927/jeremiah_23_23.htm">Jeremiah 23:23</a>.<p>[The people] found grace in the wilderness; Israel has said, Jehovah has appeared to me afar off. <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_2.htm">Jeremiah 31:2-3</a>.<p>Bring My sons from afar. <a href="3927/isaiah_43_6.htm">Isaiah 43:6</a>.<p>Hear, O peoples from afar. <a href="3927/isaiah_49_1.htm">Isaiah 49:1-2</a>.<p>The peoples and nations coming out of a hand afar off. <a href="3927/isaiah_5_26.htm">Isaiah 5:26</a>; besides elsewhere, as <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_16.htm">Jeremiah 4:16</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_15.htm">5:15</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_6_15.htm">Zechariah 6:15</a>; where by the 'nations and peoples from afar' are understood those more remote from the truths and goods of the Church. In common speech close relations are said to be near, and those more remote in relationship distant. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 769</h4><p>769. Verse 10. And standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, that great city Babylon, that mighty city, for in one hour is thy judgment come, signifies their fear of punishments, and then grievous lamentation, that this religious persuasion, so fortified, could be so suddenly and completely overturned, and that they could perish. "To stand afar off for the fear of torment" signifies a state as yet remote from the state of those who are in condemnation, because they are in fear of torment, as will be explained in what follows. "Woe, woe," signifies grievous lamentation. That "woe" signifies lamentation over calamity, unhappiness, and condemnation, may be seen above, (<a href="416.htm">416</a>); hence "woe, woe" signifies grievous lamentation. By "the great city Babylon" that religious persuasion is signified; here as above, (<a href="751.htm">751</a>), Babylon as a woman or harlot, because "her torment" is spoken of. By "mighty city" is signified the religious persuasion so fortified. By "in one hour is thy judgment come" is signified that it could be so suddenly overturned, and that they could perish. "In one hour" signifies so suddenly; and by "judgment" is signified its overthrow and the destruction of those who committed whoredom and lived luxuriously with the harlot, who are here treated of. That they perished by the Last Judgment may be seen in the small work on The Last Judgment and Babylon Destroyed, published at London, 1758. These things are said respecting that destruction.</p><p>[2] The reason that "they stood afar off for fear of her torment" signifies a state as yet remote from the state of those who are in condemnation, because in fear of the torment, is because by "afar off" is not meant remoteness of space, but remoteness of state, when one is in fear of punishments; for as long as a man is in a state of fear, he sees, weighs, and laments. Remoteness of state, which is remoteness in the spiritual sense, is also signified by "afar off" elsewhere in the Word, as in these passages:<p>Hear, ye that are afar off, what I will do; and ye that are near, know my might, (<a href="3927/isaiah_33_13.htm">Isaiah 33:13</a>).<p>Am I God that is near, and not a God afar off? (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_23.htm">Jeremiah 23:23</a>).<p>He found grace in the wilderness, Israel said, Jehovah hath appeared unto me from afar, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_2.htm">Jeremiah 31:2-3</a>.<p>Bring My sons from afar, (<a href="3927/isaiah_43_6.htm">Isaiah 43:6</a>).<p>Hear, ye people, from afar, (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_1.htm">Isaiah 49:1-2</a>).<p>Peoples and nations that come from a land afar off, (<a href="3927/isaiah_5_26.htm">Isaiah 5:26</a>). (<a href="3927/jeremiah_4_16.htm">Jeremiah 4:16</a>); (<a href="3927/jeremiah_6_15.htm">Jeremiah 6:15</a>) <a href="3927/zechariah_6_15.htm">Zech 6:15</a>); Besides elsewhere (as the three latter numbers above); where by "nations and peoples from afar" are meant those more remote from the truths and goods of the church. In common speech also relatives are said to be near, and those more remote in relationship are said to be distant. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 769 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>769. (Vers. 10.) "Et e longinquo stantes propter timorem cruciatus ejus, dicentes, Vae, vae, urbs illa magna Babylon, urbs illa valida, quia in una hora venit judicium tuum," significat timorem illorum pro poenis, et tunc gravem lamentationem quod, Religiosum id ita munitum tam subito et plane possit, everti, et illi possint perire. -"E longinquo stare propter timorem cruciatus" significat statum adhuc remotum a statu illorum qui in damnatione sunt, quia in timore pro cruciatu, de quo sequitur; "vae, vae," significat gravem lamentationem: quod "vae" significet lamentationem super calamitate, infelicitate et damnatione, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_769/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_410" target=_top>410</a>); inde "vae, vae," gravem lamentationem: per "urbem magnam Babylon" significatur Religiosum illud; hic ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_769/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_751" target=_top>751</a>), Babylon ut Mulier aut Meretrix, quia dicitur "cruciatus ejus:" per "urbem validam" significatur Religiosum tam munitum: per "in una hora venit judicium tuum" significatur quod illud tam subito possit everti, et illi possint perire; "in una hora" significat tam subito, et per "judicium" significatur eversio ejus et interitus illorum qui cum Meretrice illa scortati et deliciati sunt, de quibus hic agitur; quod illi per Ultimum Judicium perierint, videri potest in Opusculo de Ultimo Judicio et de Babylonia destructa, Londini 1758 edito; de illo interitu haec dicta sunt. Quod "e longinquo steterint propter timorem cruciatus ejus" significet statum adhuc remotum a statu illorum qui in damnatione sunt, quia in timore pro cruciatu, est quia per "longinquum" non intelligitur longinquum spatii, sed longinquum status, quando quis in timore est propter poenas; nam quamdiu homo in statu timoris est, tunc videt, expendit et lamentatur. Longinquum status, quod est longinquum in spirituali Sensu, etiam significatur per "longinquum" alibi in Verbo, ut in his: <p>"Audite Longinqui quid faciam, et cognoscite Propinqui virtutem Meam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_769/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_33_13" target=_top>Esajas 33:13</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>"Deus e Propinquo Ego, et non Deus e Longinquo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_769/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_22_23" target=_top>Jeremias 22:23</a>);<p>"Invenit gratiam in deserto; dixit Israel, E Longinquo Jehovah apparuit mihi," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_769/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_31_2-3" target=_top>Jeremias 31:2-3</a>);<p>"Adduc filios Meos e Longinquo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_769/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_43_6" target=_top>Esaias 43:6</a>);<p>"Audite populi e Longinquo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_769/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_49_1" target=_top>Esaias 49:1</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>Populi et gentes venientes e terra Longinquitatis, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_769/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_5_26" target=_top>Esaias 5:26</a>(; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_769/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_13_5" target=_top>13:5</a>)); (Praeter alibi, ut <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_769/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_4_16" target=_top>Jeremias 4:16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_769/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_5_15" target=_top>5:15</a>; <sup>3</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_769/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_6_15" target=_top>Sacharias 6:15</a>); <p>ubi per "gentes" et "populos e longinquo" intelliguntur remotiores a veris et bonis Ecclesiae. In communi sermone etiam affines dicuntur propinqui, et remotiores in affinitate longinqui.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;xxxiii. pro "xiii."<p>2.&nbsp;1 pro "1, 2"<p>3.&nbsp;v. pro "iv." </p>
