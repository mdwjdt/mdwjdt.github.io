<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第799节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>799.“你的客商原来是地上的大人物”表天主教的教阶中级别高者是这样：他们利用在修会教规上留给他们的各种特权作交易并谋利。“大人物”表示他们的教阶中级别高者，也就是所谓的红衣主教、大主教和主教；他们之所以被称为“客商”，是因为他们将教会的神圣事物当作货物一样来谋利（<a href="771.htm">771</a>，<a href="783.htm">783</a>节）；在此表示那些利用在修会教规上留给他们的各种特权作交易并谋利的人。从前文明显可知为何会这么说，因为这是前文的一个结果。在前文，经上说“弹竖琴者，作乐者，吹笛者，吹号者的声音，在巴比伦中间决不能再听见。各行手艺人在你中间决不能再遇见。推磨的声音在那里决不能再听见”；“灯光在那里决不能再照耀。新郎和新妇的声音，决不能再听见”；以此表示巴比伦中没有对属灵真理的任何情感，也没有对属灵真理的理解，因而没有属灵真理的思维；又没有对属灵真理的寻求和探究，没有启示和对它的洞察，因而没有构成教会的良善与真理的结合（参看<a href="792.htm">792</a>-794，<a href="796.htm">796</a>，<a href="797.htm">797</a>节）。他们之所以没有这些，是因为教阶中级别高者也作交易并谋利，从而给级别低者树了榜样。这就是为何经上说“你的客商原来是地上的大人物”。</p><p>或许有人会问：“能称得上交易的特权都有哪些？”它们并非每年的收入和薪俸，而是来自那把钥匙的权柄的豁免权；这些豁免权有：赦罪，哪怕滔天之罪，由此免受世间刑罚；向教皇求情，以获得权柄在禁婚亲的范围内结婚，在未禁婚亲的范围内离婚；无需求情，通过默许来做这种事；授予他们管辖范围内的特权；按立圣职，坚振礼；无论总体还是个别，来自修道院的报酬；从本应属于他人的其它源头中侵吞收入；以及许多其它手段。这些，而不是他们的年收入（如果他们以此为满足的话）导致他们没有思想、探究和洞察属灵真理的情感，也没有真理与良善的结合，因为它们是不义玛门（即财利）的所得，不义之人不断贪恋属世的财富，厌恶属灵的财富，也就是出于圣言的神性真理。</p><p>由此明显可知，“你的客商原来是地上的大人物”表示他们的教阶中级别高者是这样：他们利用在修会教规上留给他们的各种特权作交易并谋利。此处有必要进一步说一说“钥匙权柄”对罪行，甚至大罪的豁免权，他们利用豁免权不仅使罪人摆脱永恒的惩罚，甚至还逃脱世间的惩罚；即便没有释放他们，他们仍通过庇护进行保护。谁看不出，这种权柄并不属于宗教裁判权，而是属于民事管辖权？他们的权柄延伸到一切世俗之事上，摧毁了公共治安；而且，他们因仍留给他们的这种权柄而具有将他们以前对君王所建立的一切法庭，因而对法官，甚至最高法官的专制统治带回来的能力；若不是担心他们退出教会，他们真的会做出这些事来。这就是但以理书中这句话的意思：</p><p>从海中上来的第四兽必想改变节期和律法。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.25.htm">7:25</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 799</h4><p>799. "For your great men were the merchants of the earth." This symbolically means that those higher in the Roman Catholic hierarchy are of such a character because they use their various prerogatives, including ones left to their discretion in the regulations of their order, to buy and sell and make material gains.<p>The great men mean those higher in the Roman Catholic hierarchy, those called cardinals, bishops and primates. They are called merchants because they use the sanctities of the church as merchandise by which to make material gains (nos. <a href="771.htm">771</a>, <a href="783.htm">783</a>) - here those who use their various prerogatives, including ones left to their discretion in the regulations of their order, to buy and sell and make material gains.<p>The reason we say this is apparent from the foregoing declarations, for this follows as a consequence of them. In the foregoing declarations we are told that the sound of harpists and musicians, flutists and trumpeters, shall not be heard in Babylon anymore, that no craftsman of any craft shall be found there, that the sound of a mill shall not be heard there, that the light of a lamp shall not shine there, and that the sound of a bridegroom and bride shall not be heard there; and these symbolically mean, as may be seen above, that in Babylon there will be no affection for spiritual truth (no. <a href="792.htm">792</a>), no understanding of spiritual truth and so no thought of spiritual truth (no. <a href="793.htm">793</a>), neither any inquiry or investigation into it (no. <a href="794.htm">794</a>), nor any enlightenment or perception of it, and so no conjunction of goodness and truth, which is what forms the church (no. <a href="797.htm">797</a>). The Roman Catholics described lack these things because those higher in rank also buy and sell and make material gains, and thus furnish those lower in rank with their examples. This then is why we are told, "For your great men were the merchants of the earth."</p><p>[2] But perhaps someone will say, "What are those additional discretionary prerogatives which can be used as merchandise?"<p>They are not their annual incomes and stipends, but the dispensations they make by the power the keys give them, namely, their forgiving of sins, even heinous ones, and using this to liberate from temporal punishments; their interceding with the Pope to be able to marry people within degrees of relationship prohibited by law, and to put an end to marriages within degrees of relationship not prohibited, and allowing these themselves without interceding by acts of toleration; their granting special privileges that lie within their power to grant; their use of the power to ordain ministers and confirm them; their use of the gifts they receive in general and in particular from monasteries; their appropriation of revenues from other sources which belong by right to others; and many other things.<p>These, and not their annual incomes, if they are content with them, cause them not to have any affection for or thought of spiritual truth, any investigation into or perception of spiritual truth, or any conjunction of truth and goodness, because they are the quests of unrighteous mammon, and an unrighteous person continually lusts for natural riches and turns away from spiritual riches, which are Divine truths drawn from the Word.</p><p>[3] It can now be seen from this that the declaration, "For your great men were the merchants of the earth," symbolically means that those higher in the Roman Catholic hierarchy are of such a character because they use their various prerogatives, including ones left to their discretion in the regulations of their order, to buy and sell and make material gains.<p>To this we will add here something more about using the power of the keys to grant dispensations over the commission of crimes, even heinous ones, by which to liberate the guilty not only from eternal punishment, but also from temporal ones, and if they are not liberated, still to protect them by giving them asylum.<p>Who does not see that this does not fall within ecclesiastical authority, but rather civil authority? That it is to extend ecclesiastical government over everything secular? That it serves to destroy public trust? And that by this power still reserved for them they have the power to bring back their earlier despotic dominion over all the law courts established by kings, thus over the judges, even the highest of them - something they would also do, if they did not fear people's leaving the church.<p>This is what is meant in Daniel by the fourth beast that came up from the sea and its thinking to change the times and the law (<a href="3927/daniel_7_25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 799</h4><p>799. 'Because thy great ones <sup>1</sup>were the merchants of the land' signifies that the higher ones in their ecclesiastical hierarchy are such, because by means of various, even arbitrary, rights left to them in the statutes of the order they trade and make a profit. By 'great ones' are understood the higher ones in their ecclesiastical hierarchy, who are called cardinals, bishops and primates. These are called 'merchants' because they make gain by means of the holy things of the Church as by merchandise (<a href="771.htm">771</a>, <a href="783.htm">783</a>). Here they are those who by means of various, even arbitrary, laws left to them in the statutes of the order trade and make a profit. Why this is said is plain from the things preceding, for this is a consequence of them. In the preceding statements it is said that 'there shall not be heard any more in Babylon the voice of harpers, of musicians, of flute-players and of trumpeters, that there shall not be a craftsman of any craft, there shall not he heard the voice of a mill, there shall not be the light of a lamp, neither the voice of the bridegroom and bride.' By these things is signified that in Babylon there is not any affection of spiritual truth, nor any understanding of it and consequent thought, neither any search after and examination of it, nor enlightenment and a perception of it, and consequently no conjunction of good and truth that makes the Church, as may be seen above (<a href="792.htm">792-794</a>, <a href="796.htm">796-797</a>). The reason why they do not have these things is because the higher ones in the order also trade and make gain and thus set an example to the lower ones. This therefore is why it is said 'because thy great ones were the merchants of the hand.</p><p>[2] But perhaps someone may say, 'What are those even arbitrary rights which are called tradings?' They are not their annual revenues and stipends, but they are the dispensations resulting from the authority of the keys. These are, that they remit sins even enormous ones, and thereby release from the temporal penalties; that by intercessions with the pope they get the power for contracting marriages within the prohibited degrees, and for breaking off those within the degrees not prohibited. And they [do the same] themselves by tolerations without intercession; by gifts of the privileges pertaining to their rights; by ordinations of ministers, and confirmations; by gratuities general and particular derived from monasteries; by awards of revenues from one source which belong by right to another; and by many other things. These things, and not their annual revenues if they have been content with them, are the cause of their not having any affection, thought, examination and perception of spiritual truth, nor conjunction of truth and good, because they are the gains of the unjust mammon, and an unjust person perpetually lusts after natural wealth and is averse to the spiritual riches that are the Divine Truths (veritas) out of the Word.</p><p>[3] From these considerations it can now be established that by 'because thy great ones were the merchants of the land' is signified that the higher ones in their ecclesiastical hierarchy are such because by means of various even arbitrary rights left to them in the statutes of their order they trade and make a profit. Something further shall be said here concerning the dispensation, derived from the authority of the keys, over even enormous crimes, by means of which they not only liberate the guilty from eternal but also from temporal penalties; and if they do not liberate them, they still protect them by giving sanctuary (per azyla). Who does not see that this is not a matter of ecclesiastical but of civil jurisdiction; and that it is to extend dominion over everything secular; and that this is to destroy public security; also that by this authority still reserved to themselves they are in the power of bringing back their former despotic domination over all matters of judgment established by kings, thus over even the highest judges? This also they would do but for their fearing a withdrawal [of adherents]. This is understood in Daniel by this, that:<p>The fourth beast coming up out of the sea shall think to change times and the law (tempora et jus). <a href="3927/daniel_7_25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the Original Edition here and at verse 23 of the Contents the words magnates (great ones) and mercatores (merchants) appear in the reverse order compared with the text at the beginning of the chapter and in the Greek. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 799</h4><p>799. For thy great men <sup>1</sup>were the merchants <sup>1</sup>of the earth signifies that the higher ones in the ecclesiastical hierarchy are such, because by various arbitrary rights, left to them in the statutes of the order, they traffic and make profit. By "the great men" are meant the higher ones in their ecclesiastical hierarchy, who are called cardinals, bishops, and primates; who are called "merchants" because they make gain by the holy things of the church, as by merchandise, (<a href="771.htm">771</a>, <a href="783.htm">783</a>); here, who by various and even arbitrary rights, left to them in the statutes of the order, traffic and make profit. Why this is said is manifest from what precedes, for this is a consequence of them. In what precedes, it is said that "there shall not be heard anymore in Babylon the voice of harpers, of musicians, of pipers and of trumpeters;" that "there shall not be there an artificer of any art;" "the voice of the mill shall not be heard there;" "the light of a lamp shall not be there;" neither "the voice of bridegroom and of bride;" by which is signified that in Babylon there is not any affection of spiritual truth, nor any understanding of it and thought thence; nor any search after and investigation of it, nor enlightenment and perception of it, and thence there is no conjunction of good and truth, which makes the church; see above, (<a href="792.htm">792-794</a>, <a href="796.htm">796</a>, <a href="797.htm">797</a>). The reason that they have not these, is because the higher ones in the order also traffic and make gain, and thus set an example to the lower ones. This therefore is why it is said, "For thy great men <sup>1</sup>were the merchants of the earth."</p><p>[2] But someone perhaps may say, "What are those arbitrary rights, which can be called tradings?" They are not their annual revenues and stipends, but they are dispensations from the authority of the keys; which are, that they remit sins, even enormous ones, and thereby release from temporal punishment; that by intercessions with the pope, they get power for contracting matrimonies within the prohibited degrees, and for separating them within degrees not prohibited; and do it themselves without intercession by toleration; by granting the privileges which are within their jurisdiction; by ordinations of ministers, and confirmations; by general and particular gratuities from the monasteries; by the appropriation of revenues from other sources which belong by right to others; and by many other means. These, and not their annual revenues, if they were content with them, cause that they have no affection of thought, investigation, and perception of spiritual truth, and no conjunction of truth and good, because they are the gains of the unjust mammon; and the unjust perpetually lust for natural wealth, and are averse to spiritual riches which are Divine truths from the Word.</p><p>[3] From this it may now be evident, that by "because thy great men <sup>1</sup>were the merchants of the earth," is signified that the higher ones in their ecclesiastical hierarchy are such, because by various and even arbitrary rights, left to them in the statutes of the order, they traffic and make profit. Something further shall be said here concerning dispensation by the authority of the keys, over crimes, even enormous ones, by which they not only liberate the guilty from eternal punishments, but even from temporal punishments; and if they do not liberate them, they still protect by asylums. Who does not see that this does not belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction, but to civil jurisdiction; and that it is to extend their dominion over everything secular, and to destroy the public security; also that by this authority still reserved to them, they are in the power of bringing back their former despotic domination over all tribunals established by kings, and thus over the judges, even the highest; which also they would do, if they did not fear withdrawal? This is meant in Daniel by:<p>The fourth beast coming up out of the sea will think to change times and right, (<a href="3927/daniel_7_25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The clause, "Thy great ones were the merchants of the earth," in the text of the chapter and in the Greek is reversed, "Thy merchants were the great ones of the earth." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 799 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>799. "Quia mercatores <sup>1</sup>tui erant magnates <sup>2</sup>terrae," significat quod superiores in Hierarchia Ecclesiastica illorum tales sint, quia per varia jura etiam arbitraria illis in statutis ordinis relicta, mercantur et quaestus faciunt. - Per "magnates" intelliguntur superiores in Hierarchia Ecclesiastica illorum, qui vocantur Cardinales, Episcopi, et Primates; qui "mercatores vocantur quia per sancta Ecclesiae, ut per merces, lucrantur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_799/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_771" target=_top>771</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_799/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_783" target=_top>783</a>); hic, qui per varia jura etiam arbitraria illis in statutis ordinis relicta mercantur et quaestus faciunt. Cur hoc dicitur, patet ab antecedentibus, est enim hoc illorum consequens. In antecedentibus dicitur, quod "non audietur amplius in Babylone vox citharaedorum, musicorum, tibicinum et buccinatorum," "non erit ibi artifex alicujus artis," "non audietur ibi vox molae," "non erit ibi lux lucernae," et "non vox sponsi et sponsae;" per quae significatur, quod in Babylone non aliqua veri spiritualis affectio, non ejus intellectus et inde cogitatio, nec ejus inquisitio et scrutatio, neque illustratio et ejus perceptio, et inde nulla conjunctio boni et veri quae facit Ecclesiam (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_799/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_792" target=_top>792-794</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_799/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_796" target=_top>796</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_799/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_797" target=_top>797</a>); quod haec illis non sint, est quia superiores in ordine etiam mercantur et lucrantur, et sic dant inferioribus exempla; hoc itaque est cur dicitur, "Quia mercatores, <sup>3</sup>tui erant magnates <sup>4</sup>terrae." Sed forte quis dicat, "Quaenam illa jura etiam arbitraria sunt, quae possunt mercaturae vocari." Non sunt annui illorum reditus et stipendia, sed sunt dispensationes ex potestate clavium, quae sunt, quod remittant peccata etiam enormia, et eximant per id a poenis temporalibus; quod per intercessiones apud Papam valeant pro contrahendis matrimoniis intra gradus prohibitos, et pro illis dirimendis intra gradus non prohibitos, ac ipsi absque intercessione per tolerantias; per donationes privilegiorum quae juris illorum sint; per ordinationes ministrorum, et confirmationes; per gratuita ex monasteriis communia et particularia; per addictiones redituum aliunde qui sunt juris alieni; et per plura alia. Haec faciunt, et non annui reditus, si illis contenti sunt, quod non illis sit aliqua veri spiritualis affectio, cogitatio, scrutatio, perceptio, et non veri et boni conjunctio, quia sunt lucrationes injusti Mammonis; et injustus perpetuo concupiscit opes naturales, et aversatur opes spirituales, quae sunt Divinae Veritates ex Verbo. Ex his nunc constare potest, quod per "quia mercatores <sup>5</sup>tui erant magnates <sup>6</sup>terrae," significetur quod superiores in Hierarchia Ecclesiastica illorum tales sint, quia per varia jura etiam arbitraria illis in statutis ordinis relicta mercantur et quaestus faciunt. Adhuc aliquid hic dicetur de dispensatione ex potestate clavium super crimina etiam enormia, per quam non modo liberant reos a poenis aeternis, sed etiam a poenis temporalibus; et si non liberant, usque per azyla tutantur. Quis non videt, quod hoc non juris Ecclesiastici sit, sed juris civilis; et quod sit dominium extendere super omne saeculare; et quod sit publicam securitatem destruere; tum quod per hanc sibi adhuc reservatam potestatem sint in potentia reducendi priorem despoticam dominationem super omnia judicia a regibus stabilita, ita super judices etiam supremos (quod etiam facturi, si non timerent recessionem). Hoc intelligitur apud Danielem, per quod Quarta Bestia e mari ascendens "cogitabit immutare tempora et jus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_799/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_7_25" target=_top>7:25</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;mercatores pro "magnates"<p>2.&nbsp;magnates pro "mercatores"<p>3.&nbsp;mercatores pro "magnates"<p>4.&nbsp;magnates pro "mercatores"<p>5.&nbsp;mercatores pro "magnates"<p>6.&nbsp;magnates pro "mercatores" </p>
