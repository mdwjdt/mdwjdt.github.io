<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第936节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>936.“树上的叶子乃为医治列族”表由此而来的理性真理，那些陷入邪恶，并由此陷入虚假的人凭理性真理而被引导明智地思考，得体地生活。“树上的叶子”表示理性真理，如下文所述。“列族”表示那些处于良善并由此处于真理的人，在反面意义上表示那些陷入邪恶，并由此陷入虚假的人（<a href="483.htm">483</a>节），在此表示那些陷入邪恶，并由此陷入虚假的人，因为经上说为“医治他们”；那些陷入邪恶，并由此陷入虚假的人之所以无法靠圣言得医治，是因为他们不读圣言；但他们若拥有正常的判断力，便能凭理性真理得医治。以西结书中的这些话所表示的事与本节很相似：</p><p>看哪，有水从殿的门槛下流出，在河这边与那边的岸上必有许多可作食物的树木，其叶子必不凋残，也不断绝；每月必结新果子，树上的果子必作食物，叶子乃为治病。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.1.htm">47:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>这也是在论述新教会。“叶子”表示理性真理，这是因为“树”表示人（<a href="89.htm">89</a>，<a href="400.htm">400</a>节）；树的各个部分，如枝，叶，花，果和种，都表示人里面相对应的事物。“枝”表示人的感官和属世真理；“叶”表示人的理性真理；“花”表示理性层里面的最初属灵真理；“种”表示人的最末和最初的事物。</p><p>“叶”表示理性真理，这一点从灵界所看到的事物很清楚地看出来；因为那里也有树，以及树叶和果实；还由它们所组成的花园和乐园。对那些处于爱之良善，同时处于智慧之真理的人来说，会有结果子的树出现，枝繁叶茂；但对那些处于某种智慧之真理，并出于理性说话，却没有处于爱之良善的人来说，那里的树满是叶子，却没有果子；而对那些没有良善，也没有智慧之真理的人来说，根本没有树出现，要不然就是如同世上冬天里那种叶子全部凋零的树。没有理性的人无非就是这种树。</p><p>理性真理就是最近地接受属灵真理的真理，因为人的理性层是属灵真理的最初容器；人的理性层里面有对具有某种形式的真理的洞察，只是此人自己不像在与外在视觉相结合的更低思维中看到理性层之下的事物那样，在思维的过程中看到这真理。一些经文中的“叶子”也表示理性真理（如创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.7.htm">3:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创8.11.htm">8:11</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛34.4.htm">34:4</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.13.htm">8:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.8.htm">17:8</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.12.htm">47:12</a>；但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但4.12.htm">4:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但4.14.htm">14</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗1.3.htm">1:3</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.36.htm">26:36</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.19.htm">21:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.32.htm">24:32</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.28.htm">13:28</a>）。不过，它们的含义取决于树木的种类。“橄榄树和葡萄树的叶子”表示属天和属灵之光所照耀的理性真理；“无花果树的叶子”表示属世之光所照耀的理性真理；“杉树、杨树、橡树、松树的叶子”表示感官之光所照耀的理性真理。在灵界，当有大风摇晃后一种树叶时，它们就造成恐惧；利未记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.36.htm">26:36</a>）和约伯记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯13.55.htm">13:55</a>）中的叶子就是指这种。但前一种叶子不会如此。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 936</h4><p>936. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. This symbolizes the resulting rational truths by which people caught up in evils and the accompanying falsities are brought to think sanely and to live decently.<p>The leaves of the tree symbolize rational truths, as will be seen below. Nations symbolize people governed by goods and the accompanying truths, and in an opposite sense people caught up in evils and the accompanying falsities (no. <a href="483.htm">483</a>). Here they symbolize people caught up in evils and the accompanying falsities, because we are told that the leaves were for healing them, and people caught up in evils and the accompanying falsities cannot be healed by the Word, because they do not read it. However, if they have the judgment, they can be healed by rational truths.<p>The same symbolic meanings found in this verse are found in the following verses in Ezekiel:<p>Behold, there was water, flowing from under the threshold of the temple (which turned into a river), along (whose) bank... were very many trees (good for food) on one side and the other..., (whose) leaves do not fall, and whose fruit is not consumed. They bear fruit again every month..., (on which account) their fruit is good for food, and their leaves for healing. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_47_1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_12.htm">12</a>)<p>The subject there is also a new church.<p>Leaves symbolize rational truths because a tree symbolizes a person (nos. <a href="89.htm">89</a>, <a href="400.htm">400</a>), and every part of the tree - its branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds - then symbolizes accordant elements in the person. The branches symbolizes a person's sensory and natural truths, the leaves his rational truths, the flowers the first spiritual truths in his rational mind, the fruits the goods of love and charity, and seeds the final elements in the person and also the first.</p><p>[2] That leaves symbolize rational truths is clearly apparent from things seen in the spiritual world. For trees are also seen there, with leaves and fruits. Gardens and parks are found there that consist of trees. In the case of people possessing goods of love and at the same time truths of wisdom, fruit trees are seen with an abundance of beautiful leaves. But in the case of people who possess the truths of some wisdom, and who speak in accordance with reason, but lack goods of love, the trees appear full of leaves, but without any fruits. And in the case of people without any goods or truths of wisdom, the only trees seen are bare of any leaves, like trees in winter in the world. An irrational person is just such a tree.</p><p>[3] Rational truths are truths which most readily welcome spiritual truths, for a person's rational mind is the first receptacle of spiritual truths. Indeed, seated in a person's rational mind is his perception of truth in a form that the person does not himself see by deliberation, as he does the ideas that reside beneath his rational mind in a lower level of thought that is connected with his outer sight.<p>Leaves also symbolize rational truths in <a href="3927/genesis_3_7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>; <a href="3927/genesis_8_11.htm">8:11</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_34_4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_8_13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_17_8.htm">17:8</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_4_12.htm">Daniel 4:12</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_4_14.htm">14</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_1_3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_26_36.htm">Leviticus 26:36</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_21_19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_32.htm">24:32</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_28.htm">Mark 13:28</a>. However, their symbolic meanings vary according to the kinds of trees. The leaves of the olive tree and grape vine symbolize rational truths seen as a result of celestial and spiritual light; the leaves of the fig tree symbolize rational truths seen as a result of a natural sight, and the leaves of the fir tree, poplar, oak, and pine symbolize rational truths seen a a result of a sensual sight. The leaves of the latter strike terror in the spiritual world when blown to and fro by a strong wind. These are the leaves meant in <a href="3927/leviticus_26_36.htm">Leviticus 26:36</a> and <a href="3927/job_13_25.htm">Job 13:25</a>. However, not so the leaves of the former. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 936</h4><p>936. 'And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations' signifies the rational truths therefrom by means of which those who are in evils and consequently in untruths are led to thinking soundly and living properly. By 'the leaves of the tree' are signified rational truths, treated of below. By 'the nations' are signified those who are in goods and consequently in truths, and in the opposite sense those who are in evils and consequently in untruths (<a href="483.htm">483</a>). Here it is those who are in evils and consequently in untruths, because it is said 'for their healing,' and those who are in evils and consequently in untruths cannot be healed by the Word, because they do not read it; but if they have a strong judgment they can be healed by means of rational truths. Things similar to those in this verse are signified by these words in Ezekiel:<p>Behold waters going forth from under the threshold of the house from which there is a river, upon the banks of which is a tree of very much food on this side and that, whose leaf does not fall, nor is consumed; it is reborn month by month (in menses), whence its fruit is for food, and its leaf for medicine. <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_12.htm">12</a>; where also the New Church is treated of. The reason why by 'the leaves' are signified rational truths is because by 'a tree' is signified a man (<a href="89.htm">89</a>, <a href="400.htm">400</a>); and then by all [the parts] of a tree are signified the things agreeing to them with the man, as by the branches, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds. By 'the branches' are signified the man's natural and sensual truths, by 'the leaves' his rational truths, by 'the flowers' the earliest spiritual truths in the rational, by 'the fruits' the goods of love and charity, and by 'the seeds' are signified the man's last and first things.</p><p>[2] That by 'the leaves' are signified rational truths appears clearly from the things seen in the spiritual world; for trees appear there also, with leaves and fruits. There are gardens and paradises composed of them there. With those who are in goods of love and at the same time in truths of wisdom there appear fruit trees with beautiful luxuriant foliage; but with those who are in truths of some wisdom and speak reasonably and are not in goods of love, there appear trees with plenty of leaves but without fruit. But with those who have neither goods nor truths of wisdom, trees only appear stripped of leaves like those in the world in the time of winter. A man not rational is nothing else but such a tree.</p><p>[3] Rational truths are those that proximately receive spiritual truths, for a man's rational is the first receptacle of spiritual truths; for in the man's rational there is a perception of truth in some form, which the man himself does not see by a process of thought as he does those that are beneath the rational in 'the lower kind of thought that conjoins itself with external sight. Rational truths are signified by 'leaves' also (<a href="3927/genesis_3_7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>; <a href="3927/genesis_8_11.htm">8:11</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_34_4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_8_13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_17_8.htm">17:8</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_4_12.htm">Daniel 4:12</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_4_14.htm">14</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/daniel_4_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_4_11.htm">11</a>]; <a href="3927/psalms_1_3.htm">Psalms 1:3</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_26_36.htm">Leviticus 26:36</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_21_19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_24_32.htm">24:32</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_28.htm">Mark 13:28</a>); but [the leaves] are significant according to the species of the trees. The leaves of the olive and the vine signify truths rational by virtue of celestial and spiritual light, the leaves of the fig-tree truths rational by virtue of natural light, while the leaves of the fir, poplar, oak and pine signify truths rational by virtue of sensual light. The leaves of these excite terror in the spiritual world when they are shaken by a strong wind. These are the ones understood in. <a href="3927/leviticus_26_36.htm">Leviticus 26:36</a>; <a href="3927/job_13_25.htm">Job 13:25</a>. But with the leaves of the former [species] it is not so. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 936</h4><p>936. And the leaves of the tree were for the medicine of the nations, signifies rational truths therefrom, by which they who are in evils and thence in falsities are led to think soundly, and to live becomingly. By "the leaves of the tree" are signified rational truths, of which below. By "the nations" are signified those who are in goods and thence in truths, and in the opposite sense those who are in evils and thence in falsities, (<a href="483.htm">483</a>); here they who are in evils and thence in falsities, because it is said, "for their medicine," and they who are in evils and thence in falsities cannot be healed by the Word, because they do not read it; but if they have sound judgment, they can be healed by rational truths. Things similar to those in this verse are signified by these words in Ezekiel:<p>Behold, waters went forth from under the threshold from which was a river, upon whose bank on this side and on that were very many trees for food, whose leaf falleth not, nor is consumed; it is renewed every month, whence its fruit is for food, and its leaf for medicine, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_47_1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_12.htm">12</a>).<p>There also the New Church is treated of. That rational truths are signified by "leaves," is because by "a tree" is signified man, (<a href="83.htm">83</a>, <a href="400.htm">400</a>); and then by all the parts of a tree are signified corresponding things in man; as by the branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds. By "the branches" man's sensual and natural truths are signified; by "the leaves" his rational truths; by "the flowers" the first spiritual truths in the rational; by "the fruits" the goods of love and charity; and by "the seeds" are signified the last and the first things of man.</p><p>[2] That rational truths are signified by "the leaves," is clearly manifest from the things seen in the spiritual world; for trees appear there also, with leaves and fruits; there are gardens and paradises from them. With those who are in the goods of love and at the same time in the truths of wisdom there appear fruit-bearing trees, luxuriant with beautiful leaves, but with those who are in the truths of some wisdom, and speak from reason, and are not in the goods of love, there appear trees full of leaves, but without fruits; but with those with whom there are neither goods nor the truths of wisdom, there do not appear trees, unless stripped of their leaves, as in the time of winter in the world. A man not rational is nothing else but such a tree.</p><p>[3] Rational truths are those which proximately receive spiritual truths, for the rational of man is the first receptacle of spiritual truths; for the perception of truth in some form is in man's rational, which the man himself does not see in thought, as he does the things which are beneath the rational in the lower thought, which conjoins itself with the external sight. Rational truths are also signified by "leaves" (<a href="3927/genesis_3_7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>; <a href="3927/genesis_8_11.htm">8:11</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_34_4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_8_13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_17_8.htm">17:8</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_4_12.htm">Daniel 4:12</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_4_14.htm">14</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_1_3.htm">Psalms 1:3</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_26_36.htm">Leviticus 26:36</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_21_19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_24_32.htm">24:32</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_28.htm">Mark 13:28</a>). But their signification is according to the species of the trees. The leaves of the olive and the vine signify rational truths from celestial and spiritual light; the leaves of the fig rational truths from natural light; and the leaves of the fir, the poplar, the oak, the pine, rational truths from sensual light.

But it is not so with the leaves of the former. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 936 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>936. "Et folia arboris in medicinam gentium," significat vera rationalia inde, per quae illi qui in malis et inde falsis sint, perducuntur ad cogitandum sane et ad vivendum decenter. - Per "folia arboris" significantur vera rationalia (de quibus infra); per "gentes" significantur qui in bonis et inde veris sunt, et in opposito sensu qui in malis et inde falsis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_483" target=_top>483</a>); hic qui in malis et inde, falsis, quia dicitur "in medicinam" illorum; et illi qui in malis et inde falsis sunt, non possunt sanari per Verbum, quia hoc non legunt; sed si judicio pollent, sanari possunt per vera rationalia. Similia quae in hoc versu significantur per haec apud Ezechielem: <p>Ecce aquae exeuntes desub limine Domus ex quibus fluvius, "super cujus ripa Arbor cibi multa valde hinc et hinc, cujus non decidit Folium neque consumitur, in menses renascitur, unde fructus ejus est in cibum, et Folium ejus in Medicinam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_47_1" target=_top>47:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_47_7" target=_top>7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_47_12" target=_top>12</a>);<p>ibi etiam de Nova Ecclesia.

Quod per "folia" significentur vera rationalia, patet clare a visis in mundo spirituali; apparent enim ibi etiam arbores cum foliis et fructibus, sunt ibi horti et paradisi ex illis: apud eos qui in bonis amoris et simul in veris sapientiae sunt, apparent arbores fructiferae luxuriantes foliis pulchris; at apud illos qui in veris alicujus sapientiae sunt, et ex ratione loquuntur, et non in bonis amoris, apparent arbores plenae foliis sed absque fructibus; at apud quos non sunt bona nec vera sapientiae, non apparent arbores, nisi denudatae foliis quales tempore hyemis in mundo; homo non rationalis nec aliud est quam talis arbor. Vera rationalia sunt quae proxime recipiunt vera spiritualia est enim rationale hominis primum receptaculum veritatum spiritualium, nam in rationali hominis est perceptio veri in aliqua forma, quam ipse homo non videt cogitatione, sicut illa quae sub rationali sunt in cogitatione inferiore, quae se conjungit cum visu externo, Per "folia" etiam significantur vera rationalia <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_3_7" target=_top>Genesis 3:7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_8_11" target=_top>8:11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_34_4" target=_top>Esaias 34:4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_8_13" target=_top>Jeremias 8:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_17_8" target=_top>17:8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_47_12" target=_top>Ezechiel 47:12</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_4_9" target=_top>Daniel 4:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_4_11" target=_top>11</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_4_12" target=_top>12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_4_14" target=_top>14</a>); <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_1_3" target=_top>Psalm 1:3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_26_36" target=_top>Leviticus 26:36</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_21_19" target=_top>Matthaeus 21:19</a>; <sup>1</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_32" target=_top>24:32</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_936/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_13_28" target=_top>Marcus 13:28</a>. <p>Sed significant secundum species arborum; folia oleae et vitis significant vera rationalia ex luce caelesti et spirituali; folia ficus vera rationalia ex luce naturali; et folia abietis, populi, quercus, pini, rationalia ex luce sensuali.
