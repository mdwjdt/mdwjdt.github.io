<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>485.启11:1.“有一根像量杖的芦苇赐给我”表主赐给约翰认识并看到天上和世上教会状态的能力和权柄。“芦苇”表示如人凭自己所拥有的那种微弱能力；“杖”表示如人从主所拥有的那种强大能力；因此，所赐“像量杖的芦苇”表示来自主的能力。这是认识并看到天上和世上教会状态的能力和权柄，这一点从本章接下来直到结尾的内容明显看出来。</p><p>“芦苇”或藤条表示如人凭自己所拥有的那种微弱能力，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>看哪，你所倚靠的埃及是那压伤的苇杖；人若靠这杖，就必刺透他的手。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛36.6.htm">36:6</a>）</p><p>埃及一切的居民，因向以色列家成了芦苇的杖，就知道我是耶和华；他们用手持住你，你就断折，伤了他们的肩。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.6.htm">29:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.7.htm">7</a>）</p><p>“埃及”表示信靠自己力量的属世人，所以他被称为“压伤的苇杖”。在以赛亚书，“芦苇”表示微弱的能力：</p><p>压伤的芦苇，他不折断；冒烟的残麻，他不扑灭。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.3.htm">42:3</a>）</p><p>而“杖”表示来自主的强大能力，在此表示知道教会状态的能力，因为“殿和祭坛”用杖来量；“量”表示知道，“殿和祭坛”表示教会，对此，稍后就会看到。“杖”之所以表示能力，是因为在古人当中，制造杖的“木”表示良善；还因为杖代替并支撑右手，而“右手”表示能力；正因如此，权杖就是一根短杖，而“权杖”表示国王的权柄；在希伯来语，“权杖”（scepter）和“杖”（rod或staff）是同一个词。</p><p>“杖”（staff或译为棍、竿等）表示能力（或权柄），这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>你们说，那有能力的杖和那美好的棍，何竟折断了呢？要从荣耀的位上下来，坐受干渴。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 48.17.htm"> 48:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 48.18.htm">18</a>）</p><p>耶和华必使你从锡安伸出能力的杖来。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗110.2.htm">110:2</a>）</p><p>你用杖刺透不信者的头。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.14.htm">3:14</a>）</p><p>以色列是耶和华产业的杖。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.16.htm">10:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.19.htm">51:19</a>）</p><p>你的杖，你的竿都安慰我。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗23.4.htm">23:4</a>）</p><p>耶和华折断了恶人的杖。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.4.htm">9:4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.5.htm">14:5</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗125.3.htm">125:3</a>）</p><p>我的民求问木偶；他的木杖就指示他们。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.12.htm">4:12</a>）</p><p>耶和华从耶路撒冷除掉整个粮杖和整个水杖。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.1.htm">3:1</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.16.htm">4:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结5.16.htm">5:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结14.13.htm">14:13</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.16.htm">105:16</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.26.htm">26:26</a>）</p><p>“粮与水的杖”表示良善与真理的能力，“耶路撒冷”表示教会。</p><p>利未的杖上有亚伦的名字，在会幕里开了花，结了熟杏。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民17.2.htm">17:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民17.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>“利未的杖”在属灵意义上无非表示真理与良善的能力，因为“利未”和“亚伦”表示教会的真理与良善。</p><p>“杖”表示能力，这一点从摩西之杖的能力明显看出来：</p><p>将杖伸出，水变成血。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出7.20.htm">7:20</a>）</p><p>青蛙因它上到埃及地。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出8.1.htm">8:1</a>等）</p><p>尘土因它变作虱子。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出8.16.htm">8:16</a>等）</p><p>因它打雷、下雹。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出9.23.htm">9:23</a>等）</p><p>蝗虫因它上来。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出10.12.htm">10:12</a>等）</p><p>红海因它分开，又回转。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出14.16.htm">14:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出14.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出14.26.htm">26</a>）</p><p>水因它从何烈的磐石中流出。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出17.5.htm">17:5</a>等；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.7.htm">20:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>约书亚和摩西因它战胜亚玛力人。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出17.9.htm">17:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出17.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>因使者的杖就有火从磐石中出来。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士6.21.htm">6:21</a>）</p><p>从这些经文明显可知，“杖”表示能力；在别处也是（如以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.5.htm">10:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.24.htm">24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.26.htm">26</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.4.htm">11:4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.5.htm">14:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.31.htm">30:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.32.htm">32</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结19.10.htm">19:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结19.14.htm">14</a>；哀歌3:1；弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.14.htm">7:14</a>；撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚10.11.htm">10:11</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.18.htm">21:18</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 485</h4><p>485. CHAPTER 11<p>1. Then I was given a reed like a measuring rod. And the angel stood by, saying, "Rise and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship there.<p>2. But leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the gentiles. And they will tread the holy city underfoot for forty-two months.<p>3. And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth."<p>4. These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth.<p>5. And if anyone wants to harm them, fire will proceed from their mouth and devour their enemies. And if anyone wants to do them injury, he must be killed in this manner.<p>6. These have power to shut heaven, so that no rain falls in the days of their prophecy; and they have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.<p>7. Then, when they finish their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war against them, overcome them, and kill them.<p>8. And their bodies will lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.<p>9. Then those from the peoples, tribes, tongues, and nations will see their bodies for three and a half days, and not allow their bodies to be put into tombs.<p>10. And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and be glad, and send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.<p>11. But after the three and a half days the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them.<p>12. And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." And they ascended to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies saw them.<p>13. In the same hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth part of the city fell. And in the earthquake seven thousand people by name were killed, and the rest were afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven.<p>14. The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly.<p>15. Then the seventh angel sounded, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!"<p>16. And the twenty-four elders who sat before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshiped God,<p>17. saying: "We give You thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who are and who were and who are to come, because You have taken Your great power and entered Your kingdom.<p>18. The nations were angry, and Your wrath has come, and the time to judge the dead, and to reward Your servants the prophets and saints, and those who fear Your name, small and great, and to destroy those who are destroying the earth."<p>19. Then the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple. And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.<p>THE SPIRITUAL MEANING<p>The Contents of the Whole Chapter<p>The subject continues to be the state of the church among the Protestant Reformed and the character of those inwardly caught up in faith alone in opposition to the two essential elements of the New Church, namely, that the Lord alone is God of heaven and earth, whose humanity is Divine, and that people ought to live in accordance with the Ten Commandments. These two essential elements were proclaimed before them (verses 3-6). But they were utterly rejected (verses 7-10). The Lord revived them (verses 11, 12). Those people perished who rejected them (verse 13). From the New Heaven the state of the New Church was shown (verses 15-19).<p>The Contents of the Individual Verses:<p></p><table><thead><tr><th>Verse Contents</th><th>Spiritual Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Then I was given a reed like a measuring rod.</td><td>John was given the ability and power to learn and see the state of the church in heaven and in the world.</td></tr><tr><td>And the angel stood by, saying, "Rise and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship there.</td><td>The Lord's presence and His command to see and learn the state of the church in the New Heaven.</td></tr><tr><td>2. But leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it,</td><td>The state of the church on earth, as it is still, must be set aside and not learned.</td></tr><tr><td>for it has been given to the gentiles.</td><td>Because, owing to evil practices, the state of that church has been lost and forsaken.</td></tr><tr><td>And they will tread the holy city underfoot for forty-two months.</td><td>It has dispelled every truth of the Word to the point that none remains.</td></tr><tr><td>3. And I will give power to my two witnesses,</td><td>Those people who confess and acknowledge from the heart that the Lord is God of heaven and earth, whose humanity is Divine, and who are conjoined with Him by a life in accordance with the Ten Commandments.</td></tr><tr><td>and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days,</td><td>These two - an acknowledgment of the Lord and a life in accordance with the Ten Commandments, which are the two essential elements of the New Church - must be taught until the end and a new beginning.</td></tr><tr><td>clothed in sackcloth."</td><td>The grief experienced meanwhile over the truth's not being accepted.</td></tr><tr><td>4. These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth.</td><td>The love and intelligence, or charity and faith, that people have in them from the Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>5. And if anyone wants to harm them, fire will proceed from their mouth and devour their enemies.</td><td>Anyone who wishes to destroy these two essential elements perishes from a hellish love.</td></tr><tr><td>And if anyone wants to do them injury, he must be killed in that way.</td><td>Anyone who condemns the two essential elements is likewise condemned.</td></tr><tr><td>6. These have power to shut heaven, so that no rain falls in the days of their prophecy;</td><td>People who turn away from these two essential elements cannot receive any truth from heaven.</td></tr><tr><td>and they have power over waters to turn them to blood,</td><td>People who turn away from these two essential elements falsify the Word's truths.</td></tr><tr><td>and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.</td><td>People who wish to destroy these two essential elements propel themselves into evils and falsities of every kind, as often as, and in the measure that, they do so.</td></tr><tr><td>7. Then, when they finish their testimony,</td><td>After the Lord has taught these two essential elements of the New Church,</td></tr><tr><td>the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war against them, overcome them, and kill them.</td><td>those people who are caught up in the interior tenets of the doctrine regarding faith alone will reject these two elements.</td></tr><tr><td>8. And their bodies will lie in the street of the great city</td><td>These two elements have been utterly rejected.</td></tr><tr><td>which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt,</td><td>The two hellish loves, namely, a love of ruling springing from a love of self, and a love of holding sway from a conceit in one's own intelligence, loves which are present in the church where there is not one God and where the Lord is not worshiped, and where people do not live in accordance with the Ten Commandments.</td></tr><tr><td>where also our Lord was crucified.</td><td>A failure to acknowledge the Lord's Divine humanity, and thus a state in which He is rejected.</td></tr><tr><td>9. Then those from the peoples, tribes, tongues, and nations will see their bodies for three and a half days,</td><td>All those who were or who would be caught up in doctrinal falsities and evil practices at the end of the church still existing, when they have heard and later hear about these two essential elements at the beginning of the New Church,</td></tr><tr><td>and not allow their bodies to be put into tombs.</td><td>have condemned them and will continue to condemn them.</td></tr><tr><td>10. And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and be glad,</td><td>The delight of the heart and soul's affection among those people in the church caught up in faith alone.</td></tr><tr><td>and send gifts to one another,</td><td>Their consociation by love and friendship.</td></tr><tr><td>because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.</td><td>These two essential elements of the New Church, opposed as they are to the two essential elements accepted in the Protestant Reformed Church, are objects of contempt, distress, and repugnance.</td></tr><tr><td>11. But after the three and a half days the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet,</td><td>As the New Church commences and grows, these two essential elements are made living by the Lord in people who accept them.</td></tr><tr><td>and great fear fell on those who saw them.</td><td>A disturbance of the mind and alarm at Divine truths.</td></tr><tr><td>12. And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here."</td><td>The two essential elements of the New Church raised by the Lord into heaven, where they originate and where they remain, and where they are protected.</td></tr><tr><td>And they ascended to heaven in a cloud,</td><td>Their elevation into heaven and conjunction with the Lord there through the Divine truth of the Word in its literal sense.</td></tr><tr><td>and their enemies saw them.</td><td>People caught up in a faith divorced from charity heard of these, but remained in their falsities.</td></tr><tr><td>13. In the same hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth part of the city fell.</td><td>A considerable change of state occurring then in those people, and their being plucked away from heaven and sinking into hell.</td></tr><tr><td>And in the earthquake seven thousand people by name were killed,</td><td>All those people who professed faith alone and for that reason made works of charity of no account, perished.</td></tr><tr><td>and the rest were afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven.</td><td>People who saw their destruction acknowledged the Lord and were set apart.</td></tr><tr><td>14. The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly.</td><td>A lamentation over the corrupted state of the church, and lastly a final lamentation, as depicted after this.</td></tr><tr><td>15. Then the seventh angel sounded,</td><td>An examination and exposure of the state of the church after its end, at the time of the Lord's advent and the advent of His kingdom.</td></tr><tr><td>and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!"</td><td>Celebrations on the part of angels, that heaven and the church had become the Lord's, as they had been from the beginning, and that they had now become those of His Divine humanity, thus that the Lord would reign over heaven and earth as regards both aspects of Him to eternity.</td></tr><tr><td>16. And the twenty-four elders who sat before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshiped God,</td><td>An acknowledgment on the part of all the angels in heaven that the Lord is God of heaven and earth, and their highest adoration of Him.</td></tr><tr><td>17. saying: "We give You thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who are and who were and who are to come,</td><td>A confession and glorification on the part of the angels in heaven, that the Lord is He who exists, lives, and has power of Himself, and who governs all things, because He alone is eternal and infinite.</td></tr><tr><td>because You have taken Your great power and entered Your kingdom.</td><td>The New Heaven and New Church, where people will acknowledge Him alone as God.</td></tr><tr><td>18. The nations were angry,</td><td>People who were caught up in faith alone and thus in evil practices were enraged, and harassed those who opposed their faith.</td></tr><tr><td>and Your wrath has come, and the time to judge the dead,</td><td>Their destruction, and the last judgment on those people who were without any spiritual life.</td></tr><tr><td>and to reward Your servants the prophets and saints,</td><td>The happiness of eternal life for people who possess doctrinal truths from the Word and live in accordance with them.</td></tr><tr><td>and those who fear Your name, small and great,</td><td>People who love things having to do with the Lord, in a lesser or greater degree.</td></tr><tr><td>and to destroy those who are destroying the earth."</td><td>The casting down into hell of the people who destroyed the church.</td></tr><tr><td>19. Then the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple.</td><td>The New Heaven, in which the Lord is worshiped in His Divine humanity, and where people live in accordance with the Ten Commandments, which constitute the two essential elements of the New Church that are the means of conjunction.</td></tr><tr><td>And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.</td><td>The reasonings, disturbances, and falsifications of goodness and truth then in the lower regions.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>THE EXPOSITION<p>Then I was given a reed like a measuring rod. (<a href="3927/revelation_11_1.htm">11:1</a>) This symbolically means that the Lord gave John the ability and power to learn and see the state of the church in heaven and in the world.<p>A reed symbolizes weak power, the kind a person has of himself, and a rod symbolizes strong power, the kind a person has from the Lord. Consequently John's being given a reed like a measuring rod symbolizes power from the Lord. That it was the ability and power to learn and see the state of the church in heaven and in the world is apparent from the events that follow in this chapter to the end.</p><p>[2] That a reed or length of cane symbolizes weak power such as a person has of himself is apparent from the following:<p>Look, you are relying on the staff of (a) broken reed, on Egypt, which, when a man leans on it, will go into his hand and pierce it. (<a href="3927/isaiah_36_6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>)<p>That... the inhabitants of Egypt may know that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel. When they took hold of you with the hand, you broke and punctured all their shoulders... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_29_6.htm">Ezekiel 29:6-7</a>)<p>Egypt symbolizes the natural person who relies on his own powers, and that is why it is called the staff of a broken reed.<p>A reed symbolizes weak power, in Isaiah:<p>A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not extinguish. (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>)</p><p>[3] A rod, on the other hand, symbolizes strong power, which comes from the Lord, here the power to learn the state of the church, because John used the rod to measure the temple and altar, and to measure means, symbolically, to learn, and the temple and altar symbolize the church, as depicted next.<p>A rod symbolizes power because in olden times people in the church made wooden rods, and wood symbolizes goodness. It also substituted for the right hand and supported it, and the right hand symbolizes power. It is owing to this that a scepter is a shortened rod, and a scepter symbolizes the power of a king. Moreover, "scepter" and "rod" in Hebrew are the same word. <sup>1</sup></p><p>[4] That a rod symbolizes power is apparent from the following passages:<p>Say, "How the strong staff is broken, the beautiful rod!" ...Come down from your glory, and sit in thirst. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_48_17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17-18</a>)<p>Jehovah shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion. (<a href="3927/psalms_110_2.htm">Psalms 110:2</a>)<p>You punctured with his shafts the head of the faithless. (<a href="3927/habakkuk_3_14.htm">Habakkuk 3:14</a>)<p>...Israel the rod of (Jehovah's) inheritance. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_10_16.htm">Jeremiah 10:16</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_19.htm">51:19</a>)<p>Your rod and Your staff will comfort me. (<a href="3927/psalms_23_4.htm">Psalms 23:4</a>)<p>Jehovah has broken the staff of the wicked... (<a href="3927/isaiah_14_5.htm">Isaiah 14:5</a>, cf. <a href="3927/isaiah_9_4.htm">Isaiah 9:4</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_125_3.htm">Psalms 125:3</a>)<p>My people consult a piece of wood, and their staff answers them. (<a href="3927/hosea_4_12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>)<p>...Jehovah... takes away from Jerusalem... the whole staff of bread and the whole staff of water. (<a href="3927/isaiah_3_1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>, cf. <a href="3927/ezekiel_4_16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_5_16.htm">5:16</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_14_13.htm">14:13</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_105_16.htm">Psalms 105:16</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_26_26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>)<p>A staff of bread and of water symbolizes the power of goodness and truth, and Jerusalem symbolizes the church.<p>The rod of Levi with the name of Aaron on it, which in the Tabernacle blossomed with almonds (<a href="3927/numbers_17_2.htm">Numbers 17:2-10</a>), symbolizes, in the spiritual sense, nothing else than the power of truth and goodness, because Levi and Aaron symbolized the truth and goodness of the church.</p><p>[5] That a rod symbolizes power is apparent from the power of Moses' rod: On being stretched out it turned water into blood (<a href="3927/exodus_7_20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>). It caused frogs to come up on the land of Egypt (<a href="3927/exodus_8_1.htm">Exodus 8:1</a>ff.). It produced lice (<a href="3927/exodus_8_16.htm">Exodus 8:16</a>f.). It summoned thunder and hail (<a href="3927/exodus_9_23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a>ff.). It caused locusts to come (<a href="3927/exodus_10_12.htm">Exodus 10:12</a>ff.).

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 485</h4><p>485. THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER<p>1. And there was given me a reed like a staff, and the angel stood by, saying, Arise, and measure the temple of God and the altar and those adoring therein.<p>2. And the court that is outside the temple, exclude, and measure it not, for it has been given to the nations, and they shall trample upon the holy community forty-two months.<p>3. And I will give unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.<p>4. These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands, which are standing before the God of the land.<p>5. And if any one wishes to hurt them, fire shall go forth out of their mouth, and shall devour their enemies; and if any one wishes to do them an injury, he must in this manner be killed.<p>6. These have authority to shut heaven, so that it may rain no rain in the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the land with every plague, as often as they will.<p>7. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast coming up out of the deep shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.<p>8. And their bodies [shall be] upon the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.<p>9. And they of peoples and tribes and tongues and nations shall see their bodies three days and a half and shall not allow their bodies to be put into tombs.<p>10. And those dwelling upon the land shall rejoice over them and be glad, and shall send gifts one to another, because those two prophets tormented those dwelling upon the land.<p>11. And after three days and a half, the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon those seeing them.<p>12. And they heard a great voice out of heaven saying to them, Come up hither, and they went up into heaven in a cloud, and their enemies saw them.<p>13. And in that hour a great earthquake was brought about, and a tenth part of the city fell, and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand names of men; and the rest became frightened, and gave glory to the God of heaven.<p>14. The second woe is past, behold the third woe is coming quickly.<p>15. And the seventh angel sounded, and great voices were produced in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world have become our Lord's and His Christ's, and He shall reign for ages of ages.<p>16. And the twenty-four elders, who are sitting before God upon their thrones, fell upon their faces, and adored God.<p>17. Saying, We give Thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, Who art and Who wast and Who art to come, that Thou hast attained Thy great power and taken over the kingdom.<p>18. And the nations were enraged; and Thy wrath is come, and the time of judging the dead, and of giving reward to Thy servants the prophets, and the saints, and to those fearing Thy Name, the small and the great; and of spoiling those spoiling the land.<p>19. And the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple; and lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail, were produced.<p>THE SPIRITUAL SENSE<p>THE CONTENTS OF THE WHOLE CHAPTER<p>It still treats of the state of the Church with the Reformed, as to the quality of those who are interiorly in faith alone contrary to the two Essentials of the New Church. These are that the Lord Only is the God of heaven and earth, and that His Human is Divine, and that men ought to live in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue.<p>That these two Essentials have been preached in their presence (verses 3-6).<p>But that they have been totally rejected (verses 7-10).<p>That they have been raised up again by the Lord (verse 55, 52).<p>That those who rejected them have perished (verse 53).<p>That out of the New Heaven the state of the New Church has been made manifest (verses 15-19).<p>THE CONTENTS OF EACH OF THE VERSES<p>1. And there was given me a reed like a staff, signifies that the capability and power of recognising and seeing the state of the Church in heaven and in the world was given.<p>And the angel stood by saying, Arise and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those adoring therein, signifies the Lord's presence and His command, that He might see and get to know the state of the Church in the New Heaven.<p>2. And the court that is outside the temple, exclude and measure it not, signifies that the state of the Church on earth, such as it is up till now, must be removed and not become known.<p>For it has been given to the nations, signifies because the state of that Church has been destroyed and desolated by evils.<p>And they shall trample upon the holy community forty-two months, signifies that it shall have dispersed every truth of the Word to such an extent that nothing is left.<p>3. And I will give unto my two witnesses, signifies those who confess and acknowledge from the heart that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth and His Human is Divine, and who are conjoined to Him by means of a life in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue.<p>And they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred [and sixty] days, signifies that these two, the acknowledgment of the Lord, and a life in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue, being the two Essentials of the New Church, are to be taught even to the end and the beginning.<p>Clothed in sackcloth, signifies mourning in the meantime on account of there being no reception of truth.<p>4. These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands, which are standing before the God of the land, signifies the love and intelligence, or charity and faith, from the Lord with them.<p>5. And if any one wishes to hurt them, fire shall go forth out of their mouth, and shall devour their enemies, signifies that he who wishes to destroy these two Essentials of the New Church perishes as the result of infernal love.<p>And if any one wishes to do them an injury, he must in this manner be killed, signifies that he who condemns them shall likewise be condemned.<p>6. These have authority to shut heaven, so that it may rain no rain in the days of their prophecy, signifies that those who turn away from these two Essentials cannot receive any truth out of heaven.<p>And they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood, signifies that those who turn away from them will falsify the truths of the Word.<p>And to smite the land with every plague as often as they will, signifies that those who wish to destroy them hurl themselves into evils and untruths of every kind, as often and as much as they do so.<p>7. And when they shall have finished [their] testimony, signifies that after the Lord has taught these two Essentials of the New Church.<p>The beast coming up out of the deep shall make war with them, and kill them, signifies that those who are in the internal things of the doctrine concerning faith alone are going to reject these two.<p>8. Their bodies [shall be] upon the street of the great city, signifies that these have been totally rejected.<p>Which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, signifies the two infernal loves, which are the love of dominion derived from the love of self and the love of ruling derived from the pride of self-intelligence, which exist in the Church where there is not one God and the Lord is not being worshipped, and where [the life] is not being lived in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue.<p>Where also our Lord was crucified, signifies no acknowledgment of the Lord's Divine Human and thus a state of rejection.<p>9. And they of peoples and tribes and tongues and nations shall see their bodies three days and a half, signifies when all those who have been and shall be in untruths of doctrine and evils of life derived from faith alone, until the end of the present Church and the beginning of the New, shall have heard and are going to hear of these two Essentials.<p>And shall not allow their bodies to be put into tombs, signifies that they have damned and are going to damn them.<p>10. And those dwelling upon the land shall rejoice over them and be glad, signifies the delight of the affection of the heart and soul in the Church with those who were in faith alone.<p>And shall send gifts one to another, signifies consociation through love and friendship.<p>Because those two prophets tormented those dwelling upon the land, signifies that these two Essentials of the New Church, by reason of their complete contrast with the two Essentials received in the Church of the Reformed, are held in contempt, dislike and aversion.<p>11. And after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet, signifies that these two Essentials, while the New Church is beginning and progressing, will be made living with those who receive.<p>And great fear fell upon those seeing them, signifies disturbance of mind and alarm at the Divine truths.<p>12. And they heard a great voice out of heaven saying to them, Come up hither, signifies these two Essentials of the New Church taken up by the Lord into heaven, whence they exist and where they are, and the protection of them.<p>And they went up into heaven in a cloud, signifies the taking up into heaven, and conjunction with the Lord there by means of the Divine Truth of the Word in the sense of its letter.<p>And their enemies saw them, signifies that those who are in a faith separated from charity heard them but remained in their own untruths.<p>13. And in that hour a great earthquake was brought about, and a tenth part of the city fell, signifies a noticeable change of state with those [in faith alone] effected then, and their being violently separated from heaven and sunk down into hell.<p>And there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand names of men, signifies that all those who confessed faith alone and therefore made the works of charity of no account perished.<p>And the rest became frightened, and gave glory to the God of heaven, signifies that those who saw their destruction acknowledged the Lord and were separated.<p>14. The second woe is past, behold the third woe is coming quickly, signifies a lamentation over the perverted state of the Church, and finally the last lamentation, of which hereafter.<p>15. And the seventh angel sounded, signifies the examination and making manifest of the state of the Church after the consummation, when there is the coming of the Lord, and His kingdom.<p>And great voices were produced in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world have become our Lord's and His Christ's, and He shall reign for ages of ages, signifies celebrations by the angels, that heaven and the Church have become the Lord's, as they were from the beginning, and that now also they have become [the heaven and Church] of His Divine Human, thus that the Lord as to both [the Divine and the Divine Human] is now going to reign over heaven and the Church to eternity.<p>16. And the twenty-four elders, who are sitting before God upon their thrones, fell upon their faces, and adored God, signifies the acknowledgment by all the angels of heaven that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, also the highest adoration.<p>17. Saying, We give Thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, Who art and Who wast and Who art to come, signifies confession and glorification by the angels of heaven that it is the Lord Who is, Who lives, and Who has power out of His Very Self, and rules all things, because He Only is Eternal and Infinite.<p>That Thou hast attained Thy great power, and taken over the kingdom, signifies the New Heaven and the New Church, where they acknowledge Him to be the Only God.<p>18. And the nations were enraged, signifies those who are in faith alone and consequently in evils of life, that they were burning with anger and attacking those who are against their faith.<p>And Thy wrath is come, and the time of judging the dead, signifies their ruin, and the last judgment upon those not having any spiritual life.<p>And of giving reward to Thy servants the prophets and the saints, signifies the felicity of eternal life with those who are in the truths of a doctrine out of the Word, and in a life in accordance therewith.<p>And to those fearing Thy Name the small and the great, signifies who love the things that are the Lord's in a lesser or a greater degree.<p>And of spoiling those spoiling the land, signifies the casting down into hell of those who have destroyed the Church.<p>19. And the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple, signifies the New Heaven, in which the Lord is worshipped in His Divine Human and there is living in accordance with the precepts of His Decalogue, these being the two Essentials of the New Church whereby conjunction [is effected].<p>And lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and great hail were produced, signifies the reasonings, the disturbances, and the falsifications of good and truth at that time in the lower regions.<p>THE EXPOSITION<p>[verse 1] 'And there was given me a reed like a staff' signifies that the capability and power of recognising and seeing the state of the Church in heaven and in the world was given him by the Lord. By 'a reed' is signified ineffectual power such as a man has from himself, and by 'a staff' is signified effective power such as a man has from the Lord. Therefore by its being said 'was given a reed like a staff' is signified power from the Lord. That it is the capability and power of recognising and seeing the state of the Church in heaven and in the world is plain from the things following in this chapter up to the end.</p><p>[2] That by 'a reed' or cane is signified ineffectual power such as a man has from himself is plain from these passages:<p>Lo, thou hast trusted upon the staff of a bruised reed, upon Egypt, whereon when a man leans it will go into his hand, and pierce it. <a href="3927/isaiah_36_6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>.<p>So that all the inhabitants of Egypt may recognise that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel; when they held thee by the hand, thou didst break, and didst pierce through every shoulder with them. <a href="3927/ezekiel_29_6.htm">Ezekiel 29:6-7</a>.<p>By 'Egypt' is signified the natural man who trusts in his own strength, and therefore he is called 'the staff of a bruised reed.' Ineffectual power is signified by 'a reed' in Isaiah:<p>A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench. <a href="3927/isaiah_42_3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>.</p><p>[3] By 'a staff,' however, is signified the effective power that is from the Lord, here [the power] of recognising the state of the Church, because the temple and the altar were being measured by the staff, and by 'to measure' is signified to recognise, and by 'the temple' and 'the altar' is signified the Church, concerning which it follows on. Power is signified by 'a staff' because the wood out of which the staves were made with the aged in the Church signifies good, and also because it is in place of the right hand and supports it, and by the 'right hand' is signified power. In consequence of this a sceptre is a short staff, and by 'a sceptre' is signified the power of a king. Indeed 'sceptre' and 'staff' are the same word in the Hebrew language.</p><p>[4] That 'a staff' signifies power is plain from these passages:<p>Say, How is the strong staff broken, the staff of ornament; come down from glory, and sit in thirst. <a href="3927/jeremiah_48_17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17-18</a>.<p>Jehovah shall send the staff of thy strength out of Zion. <a href="3927/psalms_110_2.htm">Psalms 110:2</a>.<p>Thou didst strike through with staves the head of the unfaithful, <a href="3927/habakkuk_3_14.htm">Habakkuk 3:14</a>.<p>Israel the staff of Jehovah's inheritance. <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_16.htm">Jeremiah 10:16</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_19.htm">51:19</a>.<p>Thy rod and Thy staff shall comfort me. <a href="3927/psalms_23_4.htm">Psalms 23:4-5</a>.<p>Jehovah has broken the staff of the wicked. <a href="3927/isaiah_9_4.htm">Isaiah 9:4</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/isaiah_9_3.htm">3</a>]; <a href="3927/isaiah_14_5.htm">14:5</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_125_3.htm">Psalms 125:3</a>.<p>My people asks of wood, and his staff answers them, <a href="3927/hosea_4_12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>.<p>Jehovah removing out of Jerusalem the whole staff of bread, and the whole staff of water. <a href="3927/isaiah_3_1.htm">Isaiah 3:1-2</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_4_16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_5_16.htm">5:16</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_14_13.htm">14:13</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_105_16.htm">Psalms 105:16</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_26_26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>.<p>By 'the staff of bread and water' is signified the power of good and truth, and by 'Jerusalem' the Church. By:<p>The staff of Levi, upon which Aaron's name was, which blossomed with almonds in the tent. <a href="3927/numbers_17_2.htm">Numbers 17:2-10</a> [H.B. 17-25], nothing else is signified in the spiritual sense than the power of good and truth, because the truth and good of the Church was signified by 'Levi and Aaron.</p><p>[5] That power is signified by 'a staff' is plain from the power of Moses' staff:<p>That by the stretching out of the staff the waters were turned into blood, <a href="3927/exodus_7_20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>.<p>That by means of it frogs came up upon the land of Egypt, <a href="3927/exodus_8_4.htm">Exodus 8:4</a> seq.

"Which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt," signifies two infernal loves, which are the love of dominion from the love of self, and the love of rule from the pride of one's own intelligence, which exist in the church where one God is not acknowledged, and the Lord not worshiped, and where they do not live according to the precepts of the Decalogue, (<a href="502.htm">502</a>, <a href="503.htm">503</a>). "Where also our Lord was crucified," signifies non-acknowledgment of the Lord's Divine Human, and, consequently, a state of rejection, (<a href="504.htm">504</a>).<p>Verse 9. "And they of the peoples, and tribes, and tongues, and nations, shall see their bodies three days and a half," signifies when all they, who, until the end of the present church and the beginning of the New Church, have been and will be in falsities of doctrine and evils of life from faith alone, have heard and shall hear of these two essentials, (<a href="505.htm">505</a>). "And shall not permit their bodies to be put into tombs," signifies that they have condemned and will condemn them, (<a href="506.htm">506</a>).<p>Verse 10. "And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and be glad," signifies the delight of the affection of the heart and soul in the church among those who were in faith alone, (<a href="507.htm">507</a>). "And shall send gifts one to another," signifies consociation through love and friendship, (<a href="508.htm">508</a>). "Because these two prophets tormented them that dwell upon the earth," signifies that these two essentials of the New Church, by reason of their contrariety in the two essentials in the church of the Reformed, are held in contempt, dislike, and aversion, (<a href="509.htm">509</a>).<p>Verse 11. "And after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet," signifies that these two essentials, during the commencement and progress of the New Church, with those who receive them, will be vivified by the Lord, (<a href="510.htm">510</a>). "And great fear fell upon them that saw them," signifies commotion of mind and consternation at Divine truths, (<a href="511.htm">511</a>).<p>Verse 12. "And they heard a great voice from heaven, saying to them, Come up hither," signifies that these two essentials of the New Church were taken up by the Lord into heaven, from whence they came, and where they are, and the protection of them, (<a href="512.htm">512</a>). "And they went up into heaven in a cloud," signifies the taking them up into heaven, and conjunction there with the Lord by the Divine truth of the Word in its literal sense, (<a href="513.htm">513</a>). "And their enemies saw them," signifies that they who are in faith separated from charity heard them, but remained in their own falsities, (<a href="514.htm">514</a>).<p>Verse 13. "And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell," signifies a remarkable change of state which then took place with them, and that they were torn away from heaven, and cast down into hell, (<a href="515.htm">515</a>). "And in the earthquake were killed the names of men seven thousand," signifies that all those who confessed faith alone, and therefore made no account of the works of charity, perished, (<a href="516.htm">516</a>). "And the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven," signifies that they who saw their destruction acknowledged the Lord, and were separated, (<a href="517.htm">517</a>).<p>Verse 14. "The second woe is past; behold the third woe cometh quickly," signifies lamentation over the perverted state of the church, and then the last lamentation, to be treated of presently, (<a href="518.htm">518</a>).<p>Verse 15. "And the seventh angel sounded," signifies the exploration and manifestation of the state of the church after the consummation, at the coming of the Lord and of His kingdom, (<a href="519.htm">519</a>). "And there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world are become our Lord's and His Christ's, and He shall reign for ages of ages," signifies celebrations by the angels, because heaven and the church are become the Lord's, as they were from the beginning, and because now they belong to His Divine Human, consequently that now, the Lord as to both will reign over heaven and the church to eternity, (<a href="520.htm">520</a>).<p>Verse 16. "And the four-and-twenty elders, who sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces, and adored God," signifies the acknowledgment by all the angels of heaven, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and the highest adoration, (<a href="521.htm">521</a>).<p>Verse 17. "Saying, We give Thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who is, and who was, and who is to come," signifies confession and glorification by the angels of heaven, that it is the Lord who is, who has life and power from Himself, and who rules all things, because He alone is eternal and infinite, (<a href="522.htm">522</a>). "That Thou hast taken Thy great power, and hast entered into the kingdom," signifies the New Heaven and the New Church, where they acknowledge Him to be the only God, (<a href="523.htm">523</a>).<p>Verse 18. "And the nations were angry," signifies those who are in faith alone, and thence in evils of life, that they were enraged, and infested those who are against their faith, (<a href="524.htm">524</a>). "And Thy anger is come, and the time of judging the dead," signifies their destruction, and the execution of the Last Judgment upon those who have not any spiritual life, (<a href="525.htm">525</a>). "And of giving reward to Thy servants the prophets, and to the saints," signifies the felicity of eternal life to those who are in the truths of doctrine from the Word, and in a life according to them, (<a href="526.htm">526</a>). "And to them that fear Thy name, small and great," signifies who love the things which relate to the Lord in a lesser and in a greater degree, (<a href="527.htm">527</a>). "And to destroy them that destroy the earth," signifies the casting of those into hell who have destroyed the church, (<a href="528.htm">528</a>).<p>Verse 19. "And the temple of God was opened in heaven; and there was seen in His temple the ark of His covenant," signifies the New Heaven, in which the Lord in His Divine Human is worshiped; and where they live according to the precepts of His Decalogue, which are the two essentials of the New Church, whereby conjunction is effected, (<a href="529.htm">529</a>). "And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail," signifies the ratiocinations, commotions, and falsifications of good and truth, that ensued in the lower parts.<p>THE EXPLANATION<p>Verse 1. And there was given me a reed like a staff, signifies that the faculty and power of knowing and seeing the state of the church in heaven and in the world was given to him by the Lord. By "a reed" is signified feeble power, such as man has from himself; and by "staff," is signified great power, such as man has from the Lord; therefore by "a reed was given like a staff," is signified power from the Lord. That it is the faculty and power of knowing and seeing the state of the church in heaven and in the world, is plain from what follows in this chapter to the end.</p><p>[2] That by "a reed" or cane, is signified feeble power, such as man has from himself, is evident from these passages:<p>Lo, thou trustest in the staff of a broken reed, on Egypt; on which when a man leans it will go into his hand, and pierce it, (<a href="3927/isaiah_36_6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>).<p>And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know, that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel; when they held thee by the hand thou didst break, and perforate all their shoulder, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_29_6.htm">Ezekiel 29:6-7</a>).<p>By "Egypt" is signified the natural man who trusts in his own strength, therefore he is called "the staff of a bruised reed." By "reed" is signified feeble power, in Isaiah:<p>A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench, (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>).</p><p>[3] But by a "staff" is signified strong power, which is from the Lord; here of knowing the state of the church, because "the temple and altar were measured" with a staff; and by "measuring" is signified to know, and by "the temple and altar" is signified the church; as will be seen presently. "A staff" signifies power, because wood, of which staffs were made among the ancient people, signifies good; and because it is instead of the right hand, and supports it, and by "the right hand" is signified power; hence it is, that a scepter is a short staff and by "a scepter" is signified the power of a king; and a "scepter" and "staff" are the same word in the Hebrew language.</p><p>[4] That a staff signifies power, is evident from these passages:<p>Say ye, How is the staff of strength broken, the staff of beauty; descend from glory, and sit in thirst, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_48_17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17-18</a>).<p>Jehovah will send the staff of thy strength out of Zion, (<a href="3927/psalms_110_2.htm">Psalms 110:2</a>).<p>Thou didst strike through with staffs the head of the unbelieving, (<a href="3927/habakkuk_3_14.htm">Habakkuk 3:14</a>).<p>Israel the staff of Jehovah's inheritance, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_10_16.htm">Jeremiah 10:16</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_19.htm">51:19</a>).<p>Thy rod and Thy staff shall comfort me, (<a href="3927/psalms_23_4.htm">Psalms 23:4</a>).<p>Jehovah hath broken the staff of the wicked, (<a href="3927/isaiah_9_4.htm">Isaiah 9:4</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_14_5.htm">14:5</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_125_3.htm">Psalms 125:3</a>).<p>My people inquire of wood; and his staff answers them, (<a href="3927/hosea_4_12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>).<p>Jehovah that removeth from Jerusalem the whole staff of bread and the whole staff of water, (<a href="3927/isaiah_3_1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_4_16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_5_16.htm">5:16</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_14_13.htm">14:13</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_105_16.htm">Psalms 105:16</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_26_26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>).<p>By "the staff of bread and water" the power of good and truth is signified, and by "Jerusalem" the church:<p>The staff of Levi, upon which Aaron's name was, which blossomed with almonds in the tent, (<a href="3927/numbers_17_2.htm">Numbers 17:2-10</a>),<p>signifies nothing else in the spiritual sense but the power of truth and good, because by "Levi" and "Aaron" the truth and good of the church were signified.</p><p>[5] That power is signified by "a staff" is manifest from the power of Moses' staff:<p>That by the stretching out of the staff the waters were turned into blood, (<a href="3927/exodus_7_20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>).<p>That by it frogs came up upon the land of Egypt, (<a href="3927/exodus_8_1.htm">Exodus 8:1</a>, etc .).<p>That by it there became lice, (<a href="3927/exodus_8_16.htm">Exodus 8:16</a>, etc.).<p>That by it there were thunders and hail, (<a href="3927/exodus_9_23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a>, etc .).<p>That by it the locusts went forth, (<a href="3927/exodus_10_12.htm">Exodus 10:12</a>, etc.).<p>That by it the Red Sea was divided and turned back, (<a href="3927/exodus_14_16.htm">Exodus 14:16</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_14_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_14_26.htm">26</a>).<p>That by it the waters flowed forth from the rock of Horeb, (<a href="3927/exodus_17_5.htm">Exodus 17:5</a>, etc. ;<a href="3927/numbers_20_7.htm">Numbers 20:7-13</a>).<p>That by it Joshua with Moses prevailed over the Amalekites, (<a href="3927/exodus_17_9.htm">Exodus 17:9-12</a>).<p>That fire went forth out of the rock by the staff of the angel, (<a href="3927/judges_6_21.htm">Judges 6:21</a>).<p>From these passages it is manifest that by "a staff" power is signified; and also elsewhere (as <a href="3927/isaiah_10_5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_10_24.htm">24</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_10_26.htm">26</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_11_4.htm">11:4</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_14_5.htm">14:5</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_30_31.htm">30:31-32</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_19_10.htm">Ezekiel 19:10-14</a>; <a href="3927/lamentations_3_1.htm">Lamentations 3:1</a>; <a href="3927/micah_7_14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_10_11.htm">Zechariah 10:11</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_21_18.htm">Numbers 21:18</a>). </p>

Et Atrium quod extra Templum, ejice foras, et ne illud metiaris, quia datum est gentibus, et Civitatem sanctam conculcabunt mensibus quadraginta duobus. <p>3. Et dabo duobus Testibus Meis, et prophetabunt diebus mille ducentis sexaginta, circuminduti saccis. <p>4. Hi sunt duae Olivae et duo Candelabra, quae coram Deo terrae stantia. <p>5. Et si quis illis voluerit nocere, ignis egredietur ex Ore illorum et devorabit inimicos illorum; et si quis illos voluerit damno afficere, ita oportet illum occidi. <p>6. Hi habent potestatem claudere Caelum, ut non pluat pluvia in diebus illorum prophetiae; et potestatem habent super aquas convertere illas in sanguinem; et percutere terram omni plaga, quotiescunque voluerint. <p>7. Et cum absolverint testimonium suum, Bestia ascendens ex abysso faciet bellum cum illis, et vincet illos, et occidet illos. <p>8. Et corpora illorum super platea urbis magnae, quae vocatur spiritualiter Sodoma et Aegyptus, ubi et Dominus noster crucifixus est. <p>9. Et videbunt ex populis et tribubus et linguis et gentibus corpora illorum dies tres et dimidium, et Corpora illorum non permittent poni in monumenta. <p>10. Et habitantes super terra gaudebunt super illis et laetabuntur, et munera mittent invicem, quia illi duo prophetae cruciaverunt habitantes super terra. <p>11.

Et audiverunt vocem magnam ex Caelo, dicentem illis, Ascendite huc; et ascenderunt in Caelum in nube, et viderunt illos inimici illorum. <p>13. Et in illa hora factus est terrae, motus magnus, et decima pars urbis cecidit, et Occisa sunt in terrae motu nomina hominum millia septem, et reliqui territi falsi sunt, et dederunt gloriam Deo Caeli. <p>14. Vae secundum praeteriit; ecce vae tertium venit cito. <p>15. Et septimus Angelus clanxit, et factae sunt voces magnae in Caelo, dicentes, Facta sunt regna mundi Domini nostri et Christi Ipsius, et regnabit in saecula Saeculorum. <p>16. Et viginti et quatuor Seniores, qui coram Deo sedentes super thronis suis, ceciderunt super facies suas, et adoraverunt Deum; <p>17. Dicentes, Gratias agimus Tibi, Domine Deus Omnipotens, Qui Es et Qui Eras et Qui Venturus, quod adeptus sis potentiam Tuam magnam et Regnum inieris. <p>18. Et gentes iratae sunt; et Venit ira Tua, et tempus mortuos judicandi, et dandi mercedem servis Tuis, prophetis, et sanctis, et timentibus Nomen Tuum, parvis et magnis; et perdendi perdentes terram. <p>19.

"Et datus est mihi calamus similis baculo," significat quod data sit illi a Domino facultas et potentia cognoscendi et videndi statum Ecclesiae in Caelo et in Mundo. - Per "calamum" significatur potentia debilis, qualis est homini a se, et per "baculum" significatur potentia valida, qualis est homini a Domino; quare per quod "datus sit calamus similis baculo," significatur potentia a Domino: quod sit facultas et potentia cognoscendi et videndi statum Ecclesiae in Caelo et in Mundo, patet a sequentibus in hoc capite usque ad finem. Quod per "calamum" seu cannam significetur potentia debilis qualis est homini a se, patet ex his: <p>"Ecce confisus es super baculo Calami contusi, super Aegypto; super quo quando vir nititur, intrat in manum ejus et perforat illam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_485/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_36_6" target=_top>Esaias 36:6</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>"Ut cognoscant habitatores Aegypti, quod Ego Jehovah, propterea quod illi fuerunt Baculus calami domui Israelis: quando tenuerunt te manu, confractus es, <sup>3</sup>et perfodisti illis omnem humerum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_485/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_29_6-7" target=_top>Ezechiel 29:6-7</a>);<p>per "Aegyptum" significatur naturalis homo qui fidet propriis viribus, quare vocatur "baculus calami contusi."

Quod per "baculum" significetur potentia, est quia lignum, ex quo baculi apud veteres in Ecclesia erant, significat bonum, et quia loco dextrae est, et illam fulcit, et per "dextram" significatur potentia; inde est, quod sceptrum sit curtus baculus, et per "sceptrum" significatur potentia Regis; etiam "sceptrum" et "baculus" sunt eadem vox in Lingua Hebraea.
