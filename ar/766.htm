<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>766.“她又要被火烧尽了。因为审判她的主神大有能力”表他们会仇恨主及其天堂和教会，因为那时他们发现，唯独主统治并掌管天上和地上的一切事物，而根本不是靠着自己的任何人。那要烧尽她的“火”表示对主及其天堂和教会的仇恨，对此，参看下文。“因为审判她的主（神）大有能力”表示那时，也就是在他们死后所进入的灵界，他们发现唯独主统治并掌管天上和地上的一切事物，而根本不是靠着自己的任何人。“审判她的主神大有能力”之所以表示这一点，是因为主不将任何人判入地狱，而是他们自己将自己判入地狱；因为他们一感觉到天使气场由主那里从天流下，就逃之夭夭，将自己投入地狱，这一点从前面所说明的事可以得到证实（<a href="233.htm">233</a>，<a href="325.htm">325</a>，<a href="339.htm">339</a>，<a href="340.htm">340</a>，<a href="387.htm">387</a>，<a href="502.htm">502</a>节）。</p><p>“火”表示正反两方面意义上的爱，即：天堂之爱，也就是对主之爱，和地狱之爱，也就是自我之爱（参看<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="494.htm">494</a>节）。地狱之爱就是仇恨，因为自我之爱充满仇恨；因为凡陷入此爱的人皆照其程度而爆发忿怒，对那些反对者充满仇恨和报复；而属巴比伦的人则仇恨和报复那些否认他们当被敬拜和尊崇为神圣的人。因此，当他们听说，唯独主在天上被敬拜和尊崇，无论敬拜任何人而不敬拜主，就是亵渎时，对主的崇拜在他们里面变成对祂的仇恨，旨在让他们可以被敬拜的对圣言的玷污就变成亵渎。因此，这就是“巴比伦要被火烧尽了”所表示的。“被火烧尽了”是指对亵渎神圣事物的惩罚（参看<a href="748.htm">748</a>节）。耶利米书中的这些话所表相同：</p><p>巴比伦，你这行毁灭的山哪，就是毁灭全地的，我与你反对；我必使你从山岩滚下去，使你成为烧毁的山。巴比伦的城墙必全然倾倒，她高大的城门必被火焚烧。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.25.htm">51:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.58.htm">58</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 766</h4><p>766. "And she will be burned with fire, for strong is the Lord God who judges her." This symbolically means that those Roman Catholics will be embodiments of animosity toward the Lord and toward His heaven and church, because they see then that the Lord alone governs and reigns over everything in heaven and on earth, and not at all any person of himself.<p>The fire with which she will be burned symbolizes an animosity toward the Lord and toward His heaven and church, as discussed below. "For strong is the Lord God who judges her" means, symbolically, because they see then - that is, in the spiritual world, into which they come after death - that the Lord alone governs and reigns over everything in heaven and on earth, and not at all any person of himself. "For strong is the Lord God who judges her" has this symbolic meaning because the Lord does not judge anyone to hell. Rather people themselves do, for when they sense the angelic atmosphere flowing down out of heaven from the Lord, they flee away and cast themselves into hell, as can be seen from what we presented in nos. <a href="233.htm">233</a>, <a href="325.htm">325</a>, <a href="339.htm">339</a>, <a href="340.htm">340</a>, <a href="387.htm">387</a>, <a href="502.htm">502</a> above.</p><p>[2] It may be seen in nos. <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="494.htm">494</a> above that fire symbolizes love in two senses - both heavenly love, which is a love for the Lord, and hellish love, which is a love of self. Hellish fire is animosity, because the love of self is filled with hatred. For people caught up in that love all burn with wrath to the degree of their love, and blaze with hatred and vengeance against people who attack them; and people coming from Babylon do so against people who deny that they are to be worshiped and adored as embodiments of holiness. When they are told, therefore, that the Lord alone is worshiped and adored in heaven, and that to worship some man instead of the Lord is profane, any adoration of the Lord in them becomes animosity toward Him, and any adulteration of the Word in order that they may be worshiped becomes profane.<p>This, then, is what is symbolically meant by Babylon's being burned with fire. That to be burned with fire is the punishment for profaning what is holy may be seen in no. <a href="748.htm">748</a> above.<p>The same meaning is contained in the following verses in Jeremiah:<p>...I am against you, (Babylon,) O destroying mountain, who destroys all the earth... ...I will... roll you down from the rocks, and make you a burning mountain... The... walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be burned with fire. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_58.htm">58</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 766</h4><p>766. 'And she shall be burned up in fire, for strong is the Lord God judging her' signifies that they are going to be hatreds against the Lord and against His heaven and Church, because they see then that the Only Lord has dominion and reigns over all things in the heavens and on earth, and not at all any man of himself. By the 'fire' with which 'she shall be burned up' is signified hatred against the Lord and against His heaven and Church, concerning which [there is something] below. By 'for strong is the Lord [God] judging her' is signified because they see then, that is, in the spiritual world into which they come after death, that the Only Lord has dominion and reigns over all things in the heavens and on earth, and not at all any man of himself. The reason these things are signified by 'for strong is the Lord God judging her' is because the Lord does not judge anyone to hell, but they themselves do so; for when they feel the angelic sphere flowing down from the Lord out of heaven they flee away and cast themselves into hell, as can be established out of the things that have been shown above (<a href="233.htm">233</a>, <a href="325.htm">325</a>, <a href="340.htm">340</a>, <a href="387.htm">387</a>, <a href="502.htm">502</a>).</p><p>[2] That by 'fire' is signified love in both senses, the heavenly love that is the love of the Lord and the infernal love that is the love of self, may be seen above (<a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="494.htm">494</a>). The reason infernal love is hatred is because the love of self hates, for all who are in that love break out into wrath in accordance with the degree thereof and are inflamed with hatred and revenge against those who oppose; and those who are of Babylon [are so opposed] against those who deny that they are to be worshipped and adored as holinesses. When therefore they hear that in heaven the Only Lord is worshipped and adored and that it is profane to worship any man in place of the Lord, adoration of the Lord becomes with them hatred against Him, and the adulteration of the Word on account of the end that they may be worshipped becomes profane. This, therefore, is what is signified by [the statement] that Babylon 'will be burned up with fire.' That 'to be burned up with fire' is the penalty for the profanation of what is holy may be seen above (<a href="748.htm">748</a>). The like is understood by these words in Jeremiah:<p>I am against thee, O Babel, the destroying mountain destroying the entire land. I will roll thee down out of the rocks, and I will give thee for a mountain of burning. The walls of Babylon overthrowing shall be overthrown, and her high gates shall be burned up with fire. <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_58.htm">58</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 766</h4><p>766. And she shall be burnt up in fire, for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her signifies that they will be hatreds against the Lord and against His heaven and church, because they then see that the Lord alone has dominion and reigns over all things in the heavens and on earth, and not at all any man from himself. By "fire" with which she will be burnt up is signified hatred against the Lord and against His heaven and church, of which see below. By "for strong is the Lord that judgeth her," is signified that they see then, that is, in the spiritual world into which they come after death, that the Lord alone has dominion and reigns over all things in the heavens and on earth, and not at all any man from himself. This is signified by "strong is the Lord God that judgeth her," because the Lord does not judge anyone to hell, but they themselves; for when they feel the angelic sphere concerning the Lord flowing down out of heaven, they flee away and cast themselves into hell, as may be evident from the things that were shown above, (<a href="233.htm">233</a>, <a href="325.htm">325</a>, <a href="339.htm">339-340</a>, <a href="387.htm">387</a>, <a href="502.htm">502</a>).</p><p>[2] That by "fire" is signified love in both senses, celestial love which is love to the Lord, and infernal love which is the love of self, may be seen above, (<a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="494.htm">494</a>). That infernal fire is hatred, is because the love of self hates; for all who are in that love burn with anger according to the degree of it, and are inflamed with hatred and revenge against those who oppose; and they who are of Babylon, against those that deny that they are to be worshiped and adored as sanctities. When, therefore, they hear that the Lord alone is worshiped and adored in heaven, and that to worship any man in place of the Lord is profane, adoration of the Lord becomes in them hatred against Him, and the adulteration of the Word to the end that they may be worshiped becomes profane. This, therefore, is what is signified by "Babylon shall be burned up with fire." It may be seen above, (<a href="748.htm">748</a>), that "being burned up with fire" is the punishment of the profanation of what is holy. The like is meant by these words in Jeremiah:<p>I am against thee, O Babel, the destroying mountain, that destroyest the whole earth; I will roll thee down from the rocks, and will give thee for a mountain of burning. The walls of Babel are utterly overturned, and her high gates are burned up with fire, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_58.htm">58</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 766 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>766. "Et in igne comburetur, quia fortis Dominus Deus judicans illam," significat quod futuri sint odia contra Dominum, et contra Ipsius Caelum et Ecclesiam, quia tunc vident quod Solus Dominus super omnia in Caelis et in Terris dominetur et regnet, et ne hilum aliquis homo ex se. -Per "ignem" quo comburetur, significatur odium contra Dominum, et contra Ipsius Caelum et Ecclesiam, de quo infra; per "quia fortis Dominus judicans illam" significatur quia vident tunc, hoc est, in mundo spirituali in quem post mortem veniunt, quod Solus Dominus super omnia in Caelis et in Terris dominetur et regnet, et ne hilum aliquis homo ex se; quod haec significentur per "quia fortis Dominus Deus judicans illam," est quia Dominus non judicat aliquem ad Infernum, sed ipsi; cum enim sentiunt angelicam sphaeram de Domino e Caelo defluentem, aufugiunt ac in Infernum se conjiciunt, ut constare potest ex illis quae supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_766/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233" target=_top>233</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_766/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_325" target=_top>325</a>, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_766/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_339" target=_top>339</a>,) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_766/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_340" target=_top>340</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_766/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_387" target=_top>387</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_766/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502" target=_top>502</a>) ostensa sunt. Quod per "ignem" significetur amor in utroque sensu, amor caelestis qui est amor Domini, et amor infernalis qui est amor sui, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_766/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_468" target=_top>468</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_766/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_494" target=_top>494</a>); quod ignis infernalis sit odium, est quia amor sui odit; omnes enim qui in illo amore sunt, secundum gradum ejus, ira exardescunt, ac odio et vindicta flagrant contra illos qui impugnant; et illi qui e Babylone sunt, contra illos qui negant quod ut Sanctitates colendi et adorandi sint. Ideo cum audiunt quod in Caelo Solus Dominus colatur et adoretur, et quod colere aliquem hominem loco Domini sit prophanum, fit adoratio Domini apud illos odium contra Illum; et adulteratio Verbi propter illum finem ut colantur, fit prophanum. Hoc itaque est quod significatur per quod Babylon "igne comburetur." Quod "igne comburi" sit poena prophanationis sancti, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_766/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_748" target=_top>748</a>). Simile intelligitur per haec apud Jeremiam: <p>"Ego contra te" Babel, "mons perdens, perdens universam terram; devolvam te e petris, et dabo te in montem combustionis. Muri Babelis evertendo evertentur, et portae ejus altae igne comburentur," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_766/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_51_25" target=_top>51:25</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_766/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_51_58" target=_top>58</a>). </p>
