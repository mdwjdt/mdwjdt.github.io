<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第723节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>723.“我就看见一个女人骑在朱红色的兽上，满了亵渎的名号”表该宗教建立在被他们所亵渎的圣言基础上。“女人”表示天主教或巴比伦宗教，因为下面经上说：“在她额上有名写着说，奥秘哉，大巴比伦，作地上的淫乱和一切可憎之物的母”。“女人”表示出于对真理的情感的教会（<a href="434.htm">434</a>节），在此表示处于对立情感的天主教。下面很快看到，“朱红色的兽”表示圣言；“满了亵渎的名号”表示圣言完全被亵渎；因为“亵渎”表示否认主人性里面的神性，以及对圣言的玷污（<a href="571.htm">571</a>，<a href="582.htm">582</a>，<a href="692.htm">692</a>，<a href="715.htm">715</a>节），因而表示亵渎。凡不承认主人性里面的神性，并歪曲圣言的，尽管不是有意，但的确亵渎了，只是比较轻微；但是那些将主的神性人的一切能力据为己有，因而否认它，利用圣言的一切事物来为自己谋取对教会和天堂的神圣事物的统治权，为此玷污圣言的人，亵渎就严重了。从这些事明显可知，“我就看见一个女人骑在朱红色的兽上，满了亵渎的名号”表该宗教建立在被他们所亵渎的圣言基础上。“朱红色”表示出自属天源头的圣言真理。</p><p>“朱红色的兽”表示圣言的属天神性真理，这一点乍一看，似乎风马牛不相及，显得怪异，甚至荒唐，因为它被称为“兽”；但就灵义而言，“兽”表示属世的情感，这种表达因而应用于圣言、教会和人（<a href="239.htm">239</a>，<a href="405.htm">405</a>，<a href="567.htm">567</a>节）。“四活物”，其中一个是狮子，一个是牛犊，第四个是鹰，就表示圣言，并且在以西结书还被称为“兽”（<a href="239.htm">239</a>，<a href="275.htm">275</a>，<a href="286.htm">286</a>，<a href="672.htm">672</a>节）。“马”，也是一个兽，就表示对圣言的理解（<a href="298.htm">298</a>节）。众所周知，“羔羊”表示主，“绵羊”表示教会之人，“羊群”表示教会本身。引用这些例子是为了避免有人对“朱红色的兽”表示圣言感到困惑。由于天主教的力量和尊严全仰赖圣言，故这女人看似“骑在朱红色的兽上”，正如之前她看似“坐在众水上”（｛17:1），“众水”表示被玷污和亵渎的圣言真理，如前所述（<a href="719.htm">719</a>节）。“兽”表示圣言，这一点从本章接下来论及它的经文明显看出来，如：</p><p>你所看见的兽，先前有，如今没有。凡住在地上的，见先前有，如今没有，以后再有的兽，就必希奇。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.8.htm">17:8</a>）</p><p>那先前有，如今没有的兽，自己是第八位。他也和那七位同列，并且归于沉沦。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.11.htm">17:11</a>）</p><p>那十角，就是十王，将自己的能力权柄给那兽。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.12.htm">17:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>因为神将遵行祂旨意、行一样的旨意、把他们的国给那兽放在他们心里，直等到神的话都应验了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.17.htm">17:17</a>）</p><p>这种话只论及圣言。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 723</h4><p>723. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of names of blasphemy. This symbolizes the Roman Catholic religion resting on the Word that the people profaned.<p>The woman symbolizes the Roman Catholic or Babel-like religion, for we are told in a following verse that "on her forehead a name was written: Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of the Whoredoms and Abominations of the Earth." That a woman symbolizes the church by virtue of its affection for truth may be seen in no. <a href="434.htm">434</a>; here it is the Roman Catholic religion, which is impelled by the opposite affection. The scarlet beast symbolizes the Word, as will be seen presently; and its being full of names of blasphemy symbolizes the Word's being utterly profaned. For blasphemy symbolizes a denial of the Lord's Divinity in His humanity, and an adulteration of the Word (nos. <a href="571.htm">571</a>, <a href="582.htm">582</a>, <a href="692.htm">692</a>, <a href="715.htm">715</a>), thus its profanation. For someone who fails to acknowledge the Lord's Divinity in His humanity and falsifies the Word, but not intentionally, does indeed commit profanation, but lightly. But people who claim for themselves all the power of the Lord's Divine humanity, and for that reason deny His Divinity, and who apply everything in the Word to acquiring dominion for themselves over the sanctities of the church and heaven, and for that reason adulterate the Word - those people commit serious profanation.<p>It can be seen from this that the woman John saw sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of names of blasphemy symbolizes the aforesaid religion resting on the Word that it profaned. The color scarlet symbolize the Word's truth from a celestial origin.</p><p>[2] The idea that the scarlet beast symbolizes the Word as to celestial Divine truth appears at first as far-fetched and foreign, indeed as absurd, because it is called a beast. But that a beast in the spiritual sense symbolizes a natural affection, and that it is used to symbolize the Word, the church and mankind, may be seen in nos. <a href="239.htm">239</a>, <a href="405.htm">405</a>, <a href="567.htm">567</a> above; that the four living creatures, one of which was a lion, the second a calf, and the fourth an eagle, symbolize the Word, and in Ezekiel are also called beasts, nos. <a href="239.htm">239</a>, <a href="275.htm">275</a>, <a href="286.htm">286</a>, <a href="672.htm">672</a>; and that a horse, which is also a beast, symbolizes an understanding of the Word (no. <a href="298.htm">298</a>).<p>People know that the Lamb symbolizes the Lord, that sheep symbolize the people in a church, and that a flock symbolizes the church itself.<p>We cite these points lest anyone be surprised that the scarlet beast symbolizes the Word.<p>Moreover, because the Roman Catholic religion founds its might and its grandeur on the Word, therefore John saw the woman sitting on the scarlet beast, as before she sat on many waters (verse <a href="3927/revelation_17_1.htm">1</a>), the waters symbolizing the Word's truths adulterated and profaned (no. <a href="719.htm">719</a> above).<p>That the beast here symbolizes the Word is clearly apparent from what is said about it in the verses of this chapter that follow. As in verse <a href="3927/revelation_17_8.htm">8</a>:<p>The beast that you saw was, and is not... And those who dwell on the earth will marvel..., when they see the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.<p>In verse <a href="3927/revelation_17_11.htm">11</a>:<p>The beast that was, and is not, is itself the eighth (king), and is of the seven, and is going to destruction.<p>In verses <a href="3927/revelation_17_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_17_13.htm">13</a>:<p>The ten horns... are ten kings..., (who) will give their power and authority to the beast.<p>In verse <a href="3927/revelation_17_17.htm">17</a>:<p>...God has put it into their hearts to... give their kingdom to the beast....<p>Statements like these could be made only in reference to the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 723</h4><p>723. 'And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy' signifies that form of religion [based] upon the Word profaned by them. By the woman' is signified the Roman Catholic or Babylonian form of religion, for there follows 'Upon her forehead a name was written, Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of the whoredoms and abominations of the land.' That the 'woman' signifies the Church by virtue of the affection of truth, may be seen (<a href="434.htm">434</a>); here the Roman Catholic form of religion which is in an opposite affection. By 'a scarlet beast' is signified the Word, concerning which [something] follows: and by 'full of names of blasphemy' is signified entirely profaned, for by 'blasphemy' is signified the denial of the Lord's Divine in His Human, and the adulteration of the Word (<a href="571.htm">571</a>, <a href="582.htm">582</a>, <a href="692.htm">692</a>, <a href="715.htm">715</a>), thus profanation. For he who does not acknowledge the Lord's Divine in His Human, and falsifies the Word, but not intentionally, does indeed commit profanation, though lightly. Those, however, who assign all the power of the Lord's Divine Human to themselves, and on that account deny it, and who apply all things of the Word to acquiring dominion for themselves over the holy things of the Church and heaven, and on that account adulterate the Word, commit profanation grievously. From these considerations it can he established that by 'I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of the names of blasphemy' is signified that form of religion [based] upon the Word profaned by them. By 'scarlet' is signified the truth of the Word from a celestial origin.</p><p>[2] That by 'a scarlet beast' is signified the Word as to celestial Divine Truth appears at first thought as if remote and strange, even absurd, because it is called 'a beast.' However, it may be seen above (<a href="239.htm">239</a>, <a href="405.htm">405</a>, <a href="567.htm">567</a>) that by 'a beast' in the spiritual sense is signified a natural affection, and that it is said of the Word, of the Church, and of man; that the 'four animals,' of which one was a lion, the second a calf, and the fourth an eagle, signify the Word, and are also called 'beasts' in Ezekiel (<a href="239.htm">239</a>, <a href="275.htm">275</a>, <a href="286.htm">286</a>, <a href="672.htm">672</a>); that a 'horse,' which also is a beast, signifies the understanding of the Word (<a href="298.htm">298</a>). That 'a lamb' signifies the Lord, 'a sheep' the man of the Church, and 'a flock' the Church itself, is known. These things have been brought forward lest anyone should wonder that by 'a scarlet beast' the Word is signified. And because the Roman Catholic form of religion founds its strength and dignity upon the Word, therefore that woman was seen 'sitting upon a scarlet beast,' as before seen 'upon many waters' (verse 1), by which are signified the truths (veritas) of the Word adulterated and profaned (<a href="719.htm">719</a> above). That the Word is signified by that 'beast' is manifestly plain from the things that are said of it in the following passages of this chapter, as in verse 8:<p>The beast that thou hast seen was, and is not; and the inhabitants upon the land shall wonder, seeing the beast that was and is not, but yet is.<p>In verse 11:<p>The beast that was and is not, himself is the eighth king, and is of the seven, and is going into perdition.<p>In verses 12-13:<p>That the ten horns are ten kings, who shall surrender their authority and power to the beast.<p>In verse 17:<p>God has put in their heart to give their kingdom to the beast.<p>Such things can only be said of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 723</h4><p>723. And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, signifies that religious persuasion founded upon the Word profaned by them. By "the woman" is signified the Roman Catholic or Babylonian religious persuasion, for it follows, "Upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery, Babylon the great, mother of harlots and abominations of the earth." That by "a woman" is signified the church from the affection of truth (see <a href="434.htm">434</a>), here the Roman Catholic religious persuasion, which is in an opposite affection. By "the scarlet beast" is signified the Word, as will be seen presently; and by "full of names of blasphemy," is signified that it was totally profaned; for by "blasphemy" is signified the denial of the Lord's Divine in His Human, and the adulteration of the Word, (<a href="571.htm">571</a>, <a href="582.htm">582</a>, <a href="692.htm">692</a>, <a href="715.htm">715</a>), thus profanation. For he who does not acknowledge the Lord's Divine in His Human, and falsifies the Word, though not intentionally, indeed profanes, but lightly; they who ascribe to themselves all the power of the Lord's Divine Human, and therefore deny it, and they who apply all things of the Word to acquiring to themselves dominion over the holy things of the church and heaven, and for that reason adulterate the Word, these profane grievously. From these things it may appear, that by "I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy," is signified that religious persuasion founded upon the Word profaned by them. By "scarlet" is signified the truth of the Word from a celestial origin.</p><p>[2] That by "the scarlet beast" is signified the Word as to celestial Divine truth, appears at first thought remote and strange, yea, absurd, because it is called "a beast;" but that by "a beast," in the spiritual sense, is signified natural affection, and that the expression is thus applied to the Word, to the church, and to man, may be seen above, (<a href="239.htm">239</a>, <a href="405.htm">405</a>, <a href="567.htm">567</a>). That "the four animals," one of which was a lion, another a calf, and the fourth an eagle, signify the Word, and are also called "beasts" in Ezekiel, (<a href="239.htm">239</a>, <a href="275.htm">275</a>, <a href="286.htm">286</a>, <a href="672.htm">672</a>). That "a horse," which is also a beast, signifies the understanding of the Word, (<a href="298.htm">298</a>). That "a lamb" signifies the Lord, "a sheep" the man of the church, and "a flock" the church itself, is known. These are quoted, lest anyone should wonder that "the scarlet beast" signifies the Word. And because the Roman Catholic religious persuasion rests its strength and dignity upon the Word, therefore that woman appeared "sitting upon a scarlet beast," as she had before appeared "upon many waters" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_17_1.htm">1</a>), by which are signified the truths of the Word adulterated and profaned, as above, (<a href="719.htm">719</a>). That by that "beast" is signified the Word, appears manifestly from the things said of it in the following passages of this chapter, as:<p>The beast that thou sawest, was, and is not; and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder on seeing the beast that was, and is not, and yet is, (<a href="3927/revelation_17_8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>).<p>The beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth king, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition, (<a href="3927/revelation_17_11.htm">Revelation 17:11</a>).<p>The ten horns are ten kings, who shall give their power and authority to the beast, (<a href="3927/revelation_17_12.htm">Revelation 17:12-13</a>).<p>God hath given it in their hearts to give their kingdom to the beast, (<a href="3927/revelation_17_17.htm">Revelation 17:17</a>).<p>Such things can only be said of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 723 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>723. "Et vidi Mulierem sedentem super Bestia coccinea, plena nominibus blasphemiae," significat Religiosum illud super Verbo ab illis prophanato. -Per "Mulierem" significatur Religiosum Catholico Romanum seu Babylonicum, nam sequitur, "super fronte ejus nomen scriptum, Mysterium, Babylon magna, mater scortationum et abominationum terrae. "Quod" mulier "significet Ecclesiam ex affectione veri, videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_434" target=_top>434</a>, hic Religiosum Romano Catholicum, quod est in affectione opposita; per "Bestiam coccineam" significatur Verbum, de quo sequitur; et per "plenam nominibus blasphemiae" significatur prorsus prophanatum; per "blasphemiam" enim significatur negatio Divini Domini in Humano Ipsius, et adulteratio Verbi (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_571" target=_top>571</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_582" target=_top>582</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_692" target=_top>692</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_715" target=_top>715</a>) <sup>1</sup>, ita prophanatio; nam qui non agnoscit Divinum Domini in Humano Ipsius, et falsificat Verbum, sed non ex proposito, quidem prophanat, at leviter; sed qui addicant sibi omnem potentiam Divini Humani Domini, et propterea negant illud, et qui applicant omnia Verbi ad acquirendum sibi dominium super Sancta Ecclesiae et Caeli, et propterea adulterant Verbum, illi prophanant graviter. Ex his constare potest, quod per "vidi Mulierem sedentem super Bestia coccinea, plena nominibus blasphemiae," significetur Religiosum illud super Verbo ab illis prophanato; per "coccineum" significatur Verum Verbi ex origine caelesti. Quod per "Bestiam coccineam" significetur Verbum quoad Divinum Verum Caeleste, ex prima cogitatione apparet sicut remotum et alienum, imo absonum, quia vocatur "Bestia;" sed quod per "bestiam" in Sensu spirituali significetur affectio naturalis, et quod dicatur de Verbo, de Ecclesia et de Homine, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_239" target=_top>239</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_405" target=_top>405</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_567" target=_top>567</a>. <sup>2</sup>Quod "quatuor Animalia," quorum unum erat Leo, alterum Vitulus, et quartum Aquila, significent Verbum, et quoque apud Ezechielem vocantur "Bestiae," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_239" target=_top>239</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_275" target=_top>275</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_286" target=_top>286</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_672" target=_top>672</a>. Quod "Equus," qui etiam est bestia, significet intellectum Verbi, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_298" target=_top>298</a>; quod "Agnus" significet Dominum, quod "Ovis" hominem Ecclesiae, et quod "Grex" ipsam Ecclesiam, notum est. Haec allata sunt, ne quis miretur quod per "Bestiam coccineam" significetur Verbum. Et quia Religiosum Catholico Romanum super Verbo fundat suum robur et suam dignitatem, ideo visa est Mulier illa sedens "super Bestia coccinea," ut prius "super aquis multis," (vers. 1), per quas significantur veritates Verbi adulteratae et prophanatae (supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_719" target=_top>719</a>). <sup>3</sup>Quod per "Bestiam" illam significetur Verbum, patet manifeste ex illis quae de ea in sequentibus hujus capitis dicuntur, ut in versu 8: "Bestia, quam vidisti, erat et non est; et mirabantur habitantes super terra, videntes Bestiam, quae erat et non est, attamen est." In versu II: "Bestia, quae erat et non est, ipsa Rex octavus est, et de septem est, et in interitum abit." In vers. 12, 13: quod "decem Cornua decem Reges sint, qui potentiam et potestatem suam Bestiae tradent." In versu 17: "Deus dedit in corda eorum dare Regnum suum Bestiae." Talia non possunt dici nisi de Verbo.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;715 pro "716"<p>2.&nbsp;239 pro "139"<p>3.&nbsp;719 pro "729" </p>
