<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第372节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>372.“祝福、荣耀、智慧、感谢”表主的神性属灵事物。一切对主的承认和告白总体上包括这二者：祂是神性之爱本身和神性智慧本身，因此那些在天堂和教会中的人所具有的爱及其所属一切都来自祂；智慧及其所属一切也一样。凡从主的神性之爱发出之物，都被称为属天神性；从祂的神性智慧发出之物，被称为属灵神性。主的属灵神性以“荣耀、智慧、感谢”来表示，其属天神性以随后“尊贵、权柄、大力”来表示。之前的“颂赞”表示这二者（参看<a href="289.htm">289</a>节）。“荣耀”论及神性真理，因而论及属灵神性（参看<a href="249.htm">249</a>节）。显然，“智慧”也与此相关。“感谢”也是，因为它通过神性真理来表达；人通过并凭着真理而献上感谢。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 372</h4><p>372. Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving. This symbolizes the Lord's spiritual Divine attributes.<p>All acknowledgment and confession of the Lord in general includes these two affirmations, that He is Divine love itself and Divine wisdom itself, and therefore that the love possessed by people in heaven and in the church, and everything connected with it, comes from Him, and likewise their wisdom and everything connected with it.<p>Whatever emanates from the Lord's Divine love, this we call His celestial Divinity; and whatever emanates from His Divine wisdom, this we call his spiritual Divinity.<p>The Lord's spiritual Divinity is meant by glory, wisdom and thanksgiving, and His celestial Divinity by honor, power and might, which follow next. Blessing, which is mentioned first, symbolizes both of these (see no. <a href="289.htm">289</a> above).<p>Glory is predicated of Divine truth, thus of spiritual Divinity (no. <a href="249.htm">249</a>). Wisdom is predicated of it also, plainly. Thanksgiving too, because it is prompted by Divine truth; for a person gives thanks because of it and by expressions of it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 372</h4><p>372. 'Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving' signifies the Lord's spiritual Divine things. All acknowledgment and confession of the Lord in general comprehends these two, that He is the Divine Love Itself and the Divine Wisdom Itself; and consequently that love and everything thereof with those who are in heaven and in the Church is from Him; in like manner wisdom and everything thereof. Whatever proceeds out of the Lord's Divine Love is called the celestial Divine, and what proceeds out of His Divine Wisdom is called the spiritual Divine. The Lord's spiritual Divine is understood by 'glory, wisdom and thanksgiving'; and the celestial Divine by 'honour, vigour (virtus) and strength,' which follow. The 'blessing' that precedes signifies both, as may be seen above (<a href="289.htm">289</a>). 'Glory' is said of Divine Truth, thus of the spiritual Divine (<a href="249.htm">249</a>). That 'wisdom' is said of the same, is plain. 'Thanksgiving' also is [said of it] because it is rendered out of Divine Truth, for a man gives thanks therefrom and thereby. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 372</h4><p>372. Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, signifies the Divine spiritual things of the Lord. All acknowledgment and confession of the Lord in general, comprehends these two, that He is the Divine love itself and the Divine wisdom itself, and consequently that love, and all that is of it, with those who are in heaven and in the church, is from Him; in like manner wisdom, and all that is of it. Whatsoever proceeds from the Lord's Divine love, is called the celestial Divine, and what from His Divine wisdom, is called the spiritual Divine. The Lord's spiritual Divine is meant by "glory, wisdom, and thanksgiving;" and His celestial Divine, by "honor, power, and might," which follow. "The blessing" which precedes, signifies both, as may be seen above, (<a href="289.htm">289</a>). That "glory" is predicated of the Divine truth, thus of the spiritual Divine (see <a href="249.htm">249</a>). That "wisdom" has relation to the same, is evident. That "thanksgiving" has also a like reference, is, because it is performed from the Divine truth; for man gives thanks from it and by it. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 372 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>372. "Benedictio et gloria et sapientia et gratiarum actio," significat Divina Spiritualia Domini. - Omnis agnitio et confessio Domini in genere comprehendit haec duo, quod sit Ipse Divinus Amor et Ipsa Divina Sapientia, et inde quod amor et omne ejus, illis qui in Caelo et in Ecclesia sunt, sit ab Ipso: similiter sapientia et omne ejus. Quicquid ex Divino Amore Domini procedit, vocatur Divinum Caeleste, et quod ex Divina Sapientia Ipsius, vocatur Divinum Spirituale. Divinum Spirituale Domini intelligitur per "gloriam, sapientiam et gratiarum actionem;" et Divinum Caeleste, per "honorem, virtutem et robur," quae sequuntur. "Benedictio" quae praecedit, significat utrumque; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_372/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_289" target=_top>289</a>. Quod "gloria" dicatur de Divino Vero, ita de Divino Spirituali, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_372/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_249" target=_top>249</a>; quod "sapientia" de eodem, patet; quod etiam "gratiarum actio," est quia illa fit ex Divino Vero, homo enim gratias agit ex illo et per illud. </p>
