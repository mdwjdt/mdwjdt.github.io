<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第514节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>514.“他们的仇敌也看见了”表那些陷入与仁分离之信的人听见它们，但仍留在自己的虚假中。“看见两个见证人”表示听说过新教会的这两大基本要素，还看到出于圣言的确认之事；因为他们看见两个见证人“驾着云上了天”，而“云”表示圣言的字义（<a href="24.htm">24</a>，<a href="513.htm">513</a>节）；然而，这些人并未接受它们，仍留在自己的虚假中，这一点从以事实明显看出来：除了“他们看见”外，经上没再说什么，紧接着又说有“大地震”，他们在其中灭亡。“仇敌”表示那些在按灵意叫“所多玛和埃及”的“大城”中的人，他们陷入与仁分离之信（参看<a href="501.htm">501</a>，<a href="502.htm">502</a>节，以及接下来的各节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 514</h4><p>514. And their enemies saw them. This symbolically means that people caught up in a faith divorced from charity heard of the two essential elements, but remained in their falsities.<p>To see the two witnesses means, symbolically, to hear of the two essential elements of the New Church, and also to see confirmations of them from the Word, for the people saw them ascending in a cloud, and a cloud symbolizes the literal sense of the Word (nos. <a href="24.htm">24</a>, <a href="513.htm">513</a>). That the people nevertheless did not accept them, but remained in their falsities, is apparent from the fact that we are told no more than that they saw the two, and in the next verse that there was a great earthquake in which they perished.<p>Enemies mean people in the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, and that these were people caught up in a faith divorced from charity may be seen above in nos. <a href="501.htm">501</a>, <a href="502.htm">502</a>ff. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 514</h4><p>514. 'And their enemies saw them' signifies that those who are in a faith separated from charity heard them but remained in their own untruths. By 'to see the two witnesses' is signified to hear these two Essentials of the New Church, and also to see confirming things out of the Word, because they saw them going up 'in a cloud,' and by 'a cloud' is signified the sense of the letter of the Word (<a href="24.htm">24</a>, <a href="513.htm">513</a>). That nevertheless they did not receive them but that they remained in their own untruths is plain by virtue of the fact that no more is said than that 'they saw,' and it follows on that 'a great earthquake was brought about' and they perished in it. By the 'enemies are understood those who were' in the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt,' who were those who are in a faith separated from charity, as may be seen above (<a href="501.htm">501-502</a> seq.). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 514</h4><p>514. And their enemies saw them, signifies that they who are in faith separated from charity heard them, but remained in their own falsities. By "seeing the two witnesses" is signified to hear these two essentials of the New Church, and also to see the confirming things from the Word; because they saw them "ascending in a cloud," and by "a cloud" is signified the sense of the letter of the Word, (<a href="24.htm">24</a>, <a href="513.htm">513</a>); that, nevertheless, they did not receive them, but remained in their own falsities, is evident from this, that no more is said than that "they saw," and it follows that "there was a great earthquake," in which they perished. By "enemies" are meant "they who were in the great city, which is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt," who were those that are in faith separated from charity, as may be seen above, (<a href="501.htm">501</a>, <a href="502.htm">502</a>, and following numbers). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 514 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>514. "Et viderunt illos inimici illorum," significat quod illi qui in fide separata a charitate sunt, audiverint illa, sed permanserint in suis falsis. - Per "videre binos testes" significatur audire duo illa Essentialia Novae Ecclesiae, et quoque videre confirmantia ex Verbo, quia viderunt illos "ascendentes in nube," et per "nubem" significatur Sensus literae Verbi (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_514/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24" target=_top>24</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_514/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_513" target=_top>513</a>); quod tamen non receperint, sed quod permanserint in suis falsis, patet ex eo, quod non plus dicatur quam quod "viderint," et sequitur quod "terrae motus magnus factus sit," et in illo perierint: per "inimicos," intelliguntur "qui in magna urbe, quae spiritualiter vocatur Sodoma et Aegyptus," qui quod fuerint qui in fide separata a charitate, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_514/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_501" target=_top>501</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_514/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502" target=_top>502</a>, seq.). </p>
