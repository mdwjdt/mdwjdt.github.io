<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第246节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>246.“里面都长满了眼睛”表圣言属世之义中的神性智慧来自其属灵之义和属天之义。四活物“前后都长满了眼睛”表示圣言中的神性智慧（参看<a href="240.htm">240</a>节）；此处“它们的翅膀里面都长满了眼睛”所表相同。由于圣言属世之义中的神性智慧来自圣言的属灵之义和属天之义，故经上说它们“它们里面都长满了眼睛”。至于圣言的每个细节都包含属灵之义和属天之义，可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/5.htm">5</a>-26节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 246</h4><p>246. Were full of eyes within. This symbolizes the Divine wisdom in the Word in its natural sense, springing from its spiritual and celestial meanings.<p>To be shown that living creatures full of eyes in front and in back symbolize the Divine wisdom in the Word, see no. <a href="240.htm">240</a> above. The wings being full of eyes has the same meaning here. Moreover, because the Divine wisdom in the natural sense of the Word derives from its spiritual and celestial meanings that lie within, therefore we are told that the wings were full of eyes within.<p>For more on the spiritual and celestial meanings which exist within every constituent of the Word, see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="../ss/5.htm">5-26</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 246</h4><p>246. 'And within they were full of eyes' signifies the Divine Wisdom in the Word in the natural sense out of its spiritual and celestial sense. That by the 'animals full of eyes before and behind' is signified the Divine Wisdom in the Word may be seen above (<a href="240.htm">240</a>); and in like manner here by [the statement] that the wings were 'full of eyes.' Because also the Divine Wisdom of the Word in the natural sense results from the spiritual and celestial sense that lies hidden within, it is therefore said that 'within they were full of eyes.' Concerning the spiritual and celestial senses that are within the details of the Word, <a href="../ss/5.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 5-26</a> may be seen. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 246</h4><p>246. And they were full of eyes within, signifies the Divine wisdom in the Word, in its natural sense from its spiritual and celestial senses. That by "the animals were full of eyes before and behind" is signified the Divine wisdom in the Word, may be seen above, (<a href="240.htm">240</a>); in like manner here, by "their wings were full of eyes." And because the Divine wisdom of the Word in its natural sense is from its spiritual and celestial senses, which are concealed within, it is therefore said, that "within they were full of eyes." Concerning the spiritual and celestial senses, which are contained in every particular of the Word, see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, (<a href="5.htm">5-26</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 246 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>246. Et intus plenae erant oculis," significat Divinam Sapientiam in Verbo in Sensu naturali ex Sensu spirituali et caelesti ejus. Quod per "Animalia plena oculis ante et retro" significetur Divina Sapientia in Verbo, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_246/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_240" target=_top>240</a>); simile hic per quod "alae essent plenae oculis:" et quia Divina Sapientia Verbi in Sensu naturali est ex Sensu spirituali et caelesti, qui intus latent, ideo dicitur quod "intus essent plenae oculis." De Sensu spirituali et caelesti, qui intus in singulis Verbi sunt, videatur Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_246/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_5" target=_top>5-26</a>). </p>
