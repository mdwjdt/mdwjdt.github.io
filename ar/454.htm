<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第454节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>454.启9:19.“这马的能力是在口里”表他们在确认信时仅凭话语得胜。“能力是在口里”表示确认教义的话语中的能力；因为语言的整洁、优雅，佯装的热情，确认虚假的巧妙、尤其通过圣言中的真理表象来确认，权威，认知或理解力的关闭，以及诸如此类的，会变得重要起来，而真理和圣言则变得不重要；因为真理仅在那些处于仁，并因此处于信的人面前发光，圣言也不会教导其他任何。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 454</h4><p>454. Their power was in their mouth. (<a href="3927/revelation_9_19.htm">9:19</a>) This symbolically means that they prevailed only by their discourse affirming faith.<p>Power in the mouth symbolizes a power in discourse affirming doctrine. For a harmony, elegance, feigned zeal and clever defense of falsity in speaking, especially in citing appearances of truth in the Word, with an air of authority, a closing of the intellect, and many other such expedients, accomplish everything, and neither the truth nor the Word anything. For truth shines only in the eyes of people who are directed by charity and its accompanying faith, and it is only these that the Word teaches. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 454</h4><p>454. [verse 19] 'And their power was in their mouth' signifies that they have strength only by discourse confirming faith. By 'power in the mouth' is signified power in discourse confirming doctrine; for prettiness of discourse fastidiousness, pretended zeal, ingenious confirmation of untruth especially out of the appearances of truth in the Word, authority, closure of the understanding, and many similar things, they make all-important, and not any truth (veritas) or the Word. For the truth (veritas) does not shine before any others except those who are in charity and the consequent faith, nor does the Word teach any others. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 454</h4><p>454. Verse 19. For their power was in their mouth, signifies that they only prevail by their discourse in confirmation of faith. By "power in their mouth" is signified power in discourse confirming doctrine; for neatness and elegance of language, pretended zeal, ingenious confirmation of what is false, especially from the appearances of truth in the Word, authority, closure of the understanding, and the like, effect all things, whilst truth and the Word effect nothing; for truth shines only before those who are in charity and thence in faith, nor does the Word teach any others. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 454 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>454. (Vers. 19.) "Et potestas illorum in ore illorum erat," significat quod solum valeant sermone confirmante fidem. - Per "potestatem in ore" significatur potentia in sermone confirmante doctrinam; sermonis enim concinnitas, elegantia, fictitius zelus, confirmatio ingeniosa falsi, imprimis ex apparentiis veri in Verbo, auctoritas, occlusio intellectus, et similia plura, faciunt omnia, et non aliquid veritas, nec Verbum; veritas enim non lucet coram aliis quam qui in charitate sunt et inde fide, nec Verbum docet alios. </p>
