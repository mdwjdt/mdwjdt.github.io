<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第406节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>406.“船只的三分之一部分也坏了”表他们所具有的取自圣言、服务于生活功用的良善与真理的一切认知都毁灭了。“三分之一部分”表示全部，如前所述（<a href="400.htm">400</a>，<a href="404.htm">404</a>，<a href="405.htm">405</a>节）；“船”表示取自圣言、服务于生活功用的良善与真理的认知。这些认知之所以用“船”来表示，是因为船只穿越海洋，带回必需品为属世人所用；良善与真理的认知是为属灵人所用的必需品；教会的教义来自它们，遵行教义就是生活。“船”表示这些认知，还因为它们是容器；在圣言许多地方，容器是为了所盛之物，如杯子是为了酒，盘子是为食物，会幕或圣殿是为了里面的圣物，约柜是为了律法，祭坛是为了敬拜，等等。</p><p>在以下经文中，“船”表示良善与真理的认知：</p><p>西布伦必住在海滨，必成为停船的港口。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.13.htm">49:13</a>）</p><p>“西布伦”表示良善与真理的结合。</p><p>推罗啊，造你的使你全然美丽；他们用示尼珥的松树做你的一切板，用黎巴嫩的香柏树做桅杆；用巴珊的橡树作你的桨；用象牙镶嵌基提海岛的黄杨木为舱板；西顿和亚发的居民作你荡桨的；你中间的智慧人作掌舵的；一切泛海的船只和水手，都在你中间经营交易的事；他施的船只接连成帮为你运货，你便在海中心极其丰富和荣耀。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.4.htm">27:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.25.htm">25</a>）</p><p>这论及推罗，因为在圣言中，“推罗”表示教会对真理与良善的认知。这一点从本章和接下来第十八章关于它的细节明显看出来，不过，这些细节当以属灵之义来理解。由于“推罗”表示教会对真理与良善的认知，所以经上描述了船只的细节，每个细节都表示这些有益于聪明的认知的某种品质。要不然，圣言与推罗的船只及其贸易有什么相干呢？</p><p>后面又如此描述了该教会的荒废：</p><p>你掌舵的呼号之声一发，郊野都必震动。所有荡桨的、水手和航海的舵手，都必下船，他们必为你放声痛哭。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.28.htm">27:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.30.htm">30</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.14.htm">23:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.15.htm">15</a>）</p><p>以下启示录经文同样描述了巴比伦在对真理的一切认知方面的荒废：</p><p>一时之间，这么大的财富已变为荒凉了；凡船主和坐船的并众水手，喊着说，哀哉！哀哉！这大城巴比伦啊！凡有船在海中的，都成了富足。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.17.htm">18:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.19.htm">19</a>）</p><p>可参看下面的解释。在以下经文中，“船”表示真理与良善的认知：</p><p>我的日子急速过去，它们飞快逃离，不见福乐，它们过去如快船。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯9.25.htm">9:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯9.26.htm">26</a>）</p><p>他们坐船下海，在大水中经理事务，这些人看见耶和华的作为，并祂在深处的奇事。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.23.htm">107:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.24.htm">24</a>）</p><p>众海岛必信靠我，首先是他施的船只，将你的众子从远方带来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.9.htm">60:9</a>）</p><p>众王会合，战兢抓住了他们；你用东风打破他施的船只。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗48.4.htm">48:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗48.7.htm">7</a>）</p><p>他施的船只都要哀号。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.1.htm">23:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.14.htm">14</a>）</p><p>还有其它地方（如民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.24.htm">24:24</a> ；士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.17.htm">5:17</a> ；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.26.htm">104:26</a> ；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.21.htm">33:21</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 406</h4><p>406. And a third of the ships were destroyed. This symbolically means that concepts of goodness and truth from the Word that are serviceable for application to life, in them had all been destroyed.<p>A third means, symbolically, all, as in nos. <a href="400.htm">400</a>, <a href="404.htm">404</a>, <a href="405.htm">405</a> above. Ships symbolize concepts of goodness and truth from the Word that are serviceable for application to life. Ships have this symbolism because ships travel the sea and bring back the necessities that the natural self needs for its every endeavor, and concepts of goodness and truth are the necessities that the spiritual self needs for its every endeavor. For out of them is formed the doctrine of the church, and in accordance with that a person's life.<p>Ships symbolize these concepts because they are vessels, and in many places in the Word a vessel is used to express what it contains, as a cup for wine, a dish for food, the Tabernacle or Temple for the sacred objects in it, the Ark for the Law, altars for worship, and so on.</p><p>[2] Ships symbolize concepts of goodness and truth in the following places:<p>Zebulun shall dwell by the seashore, and serve as a haven for ships... (<a href="3927/genesis_49_13.htm">Genesis 49:13</a>)<p>Zebulun means the conjunction of goodness and truth.<p>Your builders (O Tyre) have perfected your beauty. They made all your planks of fir trees from Senir; they took a cedar from Lebanon to make you a mast. Of oaks from Bashan they made your oars; they made your beam of ivory, your deck of pines from the isles of Kittim... Inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your oarsmen; your wise men were... your shipmasters... All the ships of the sea and their sailors were in you to market your merchandise... Ships of Tarshish were your companies in your commerce, by which you were filled and honored greatly in the midst of the seas. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_27_4.htm">Ezekiel 27:4-9</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_25.htm">25</a>)<p>This is said of Tyre, because Tyre in the Word symbolizes the church in respect to its concepts of truth and goodness, as can be seen from the particulars about it in this chapter, and in the following one, chapter 28, understood in its spiritual sense. Moreover, because the church's concepts of truth and goodness are symbolically meant by Tyre, therefore the ship is described in its various parts, and each part symbolizes some aspect of those concepts leading to intelligence. What does the Word have in common with ships of Tyre and its commerce?</p><p>[3] The devastation of that same church is afterward described in the following way:<p>The common-land will shake at the sound of the cry of your shipmasters, and all who handle the oar will come down from your ships; all the sailors and shipmasters of the sea... because of you will cry bitterly... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_27_28.htm">Ezekiel 27:28-30</a>; see also <a href="3927/isaiah_23_14.htm">Isaiah 23:14-15</a>)<p>The devastation of Babylon is similarly described in respect to all its concepts of truth in the following verses in the book of Revelation:<p>...in one hour such great riches were devastated. Every shipmaster, and everyone traveling on ships, and sailors... cried out... saying, "Alas, alas, the great city (Babylon), in which all became rich who had ships on the sea...." (<a href="3927/revelation_18_17.htm">Revelation 18:17</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_18_19.htm">19</a>)<p>See below for the exposition.</p><p>[4] Ships symbolize concepts of truth and goodness also in the following places:<p>My days have been swift...; they fled away, they saw no good. They passed by with ships of longing... (<a href="3927/job_9_25.htm">Job 9:25-26</a>)<p>Those who go down to the sea in ships, doing work on many waters, they see the works of Jehovah, and His wonders in the deep. (<a href="3927/psalms_107_23.htm">Psalms 107:23-24</a>)<p>...the coastlands shall trust in Me, and ships of Tarshish will be first to bring your sons from afar... (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_9.htm">Isaiah 60:9</a>)<p>...the kings assembled...; fear took hold of them... With an east wind You will break the ships of Tarshish. (<a href="3927/psalms_18_4.htm">Psalms 18:4</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_18_6.htm">6-7</a>)<p>Wail, you ships of Tarshish! (<a href="3927/isaiah_23_1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_23_14.htm">14</a>)<p>And so on elsewhere, as in <a href="3927/numbers_24_24.htm">Numbers 24:24</a>, <a href="3927/judges_5_17.htm">Judges 5:17</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_104_26.htm">Psalms 104:26</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_33_21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 406</h4><p>406. 'And a third part of the ships was destroyed' signifies that all the cognitions of good and truth out of the Word serviceable for use of life had been utterly lost with them. 'A third part' signifies all, as above (<a href="400.htm">400</a>, <a href="404.htm">404-405</a>). 'Ships' signify the cognitions of good and truth out of the Word serviceable for use of life. These are signified by 'ships' because ships cross the sea and convey the necessaries that are for the natural man for his every use, and cognitions of good and truth are the necessaries that are for the spiritual man for his every use, for the doctrine of the Church is derived from them, and a life in accordance with it. 'Ships' signify those cognitions because they are containers, and in many places in the Word the thing containing is taken for the content, as the cup for the wine, the plate for the food, the tabernacle and the temple for the holy things in them, the ark for the law, the altars for worship, and so on.</p><p>[2] 'Ships' signify cognitions of good and truth in the following places:<p>Zebulon shall dwell at the shore of the seas, and he shall be for a haven of ships. <a href="3927/genesis_49_13.htm">Genesis 49:13</a>.<p>By 'Zebulon' is understood the conjunction of good and truth.<p>O Tyre, the builders have perfected thy beauty, out of firs from Senir have they made all the boards for thee; they have taken a cedar out of Lebanon to make a mast, of oaks out of Bashan have they made thine oars, thy beam have they made of ivory, a daughter of courses (filiam gressuum) out of the isles of Chittim; the inhabitants of Zidon and Arvah were thine oarsmen, thy wise men were thy skippers, all the ships of the sea and the sailors thereof were in thee for trading; the ships of Tarshish were thy crowds in the market, whence thou wast replenished and exceedingly honoured in the heart of the seas. <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_4.htm">Ezekiel 27:4-9</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_25.htm">25</a>.<p>These things [are said] of Tyre because by 'Tyre' in the Word is signified the Church as to the cognitions of truth and good, as can be established from the details concerning it in this chapter [of Ezekiel], and in the following chapter <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_1.htm">28</a>, understood in the spiritual sense. Also, because cognitions of truth and good of the Church are signified by 'Tyre,' therefore a ship is described in its details, and by each detail is signified some quality of those cognitions leading to intelligence. What does the Word have in common with the ships of Tyre and its commerce?</p><p>[3] The devastation of that Church is afterwards described thus:<p>At the voice of the cry of thy skippers the suburbs shall quake, and all handling an oar shall come down from their ships, all the sailors and skippers of the sea shall cry out bitterly over thee. <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_28.htm">Ezekiel 27:28-30</a>; also. <a href="3927/isaiah_23_14.htm">Isaiah 23:14-15</a>.<p>The devastation of Babylon as to all the cognitions of truth is described similarly in the following [words] in the Apocalypse:<p>In one hour have so great riches been devastated, every steersman and everyone voyaging upon ships, and sailors, were crying out and saying, Woe, woe, great city Babylon, wherein all have been made rich who have ships in the sea. <a href="3927/revelation_18_17.htm">Revelation 18:17</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_18_19.htm">19</a>.</p><p>[4] The exposition may be seen below. By 'ships' are signified cognitions of truth and good also in the following places:<p>My days have been swift, they have fled away, they have not seen good, they have passed by with ships of desire, <a href="3927/job_9_25.htm">Job 9:25-26</a>.<p>Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in many waters, those have seen the works of Jehovah, and His wonders in the deep. <a href="3927/psalms_107_23.htm">Psalms 107:23-24</a>.<p>The isles shall trust in Me, and the ships of Tarshish in the beginning, to bring thy children from afar. <a href="3927/isaiah_60_9.htm">Isaiah 60:9</a>.<p>The kings have assembled, terror seized them, by an east wind Thou shalt break the ships of Tarshish. <a href="3927/psalms_48_4.htm">Psalms 48:4-7</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_48_5.htm">5-8</a>].<p>Howl, O ships of Tarshish. <a href="3927/isaiah_23_1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_23_14.htm">14</a>; besides elsewhere, as. <a href="3927/numbers_24_24.htm">Numbers 24:24</a>; <a href="3927/judges_5_17.htm">Judges 5:17</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_104_26.htm">Psalms 104:26</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_33_21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 406</h4><p>406. And the third part of the ships perished, signifies that all the knowledges of good and truth from the Word serving for use of life were destroyed with them. "The third part" signifies all, as above, (<a href="400.htm">400</a>, <a href="404.htm">404</a>, <a href="405.htm">405</a>); "ships" signify the knowledges of good and truth from the Word serving for the use of life. That these are signified by "ships" is because ships cross the sea, and bring back the necessaries which are for the natural man for every use; and the knowledges of good and truth are the necessaries which are for the spiritual man for every use of it; for from them is the doctrine of the church, and according to this is life. "Ships" signify these knowledges, because they are containers; and in many places in the Word the container is taken for the thing contained, as a cup for wine, a platter for food, the tabernacle and the temple for the holy things in them, the ark for the law, the altars for worship, and so on.</p><p>[2] "Ships" signify the knowledges of good and truth in the following passages:<p>Zebulon shall dwell at the shore of the seas, and he is for a port of the ships, (<a href="3927/genesis_49_13.htm">Genesis 49:13</a>).<p>By "Zebulon" is meant the conjunction of good and truth.<p>O Tyre, the builders have perfected thy beauty; of firs from Senir have they made all thy boards; they have taken the cedar of Lebanon to make a mast; they have made thine oars of the oaks of Bashan; thine oar-bench have they made of ivory, the daughter of steps from the isles of Kittim; the inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were thy rowers; thy wise men were thy ship-masters; all the ships of the sea and their sailors were in thee to trade; the ships of Tarshish were thy troops in thy tradings; whence thou wast exceedingly filled and honored in the heart of the seas, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_27_4.htm">Ezekiel 27:4-9</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_25.htm">25</a>).<p>This is concerning Tyre, because the church as to the knowledges of truth and good is signified by "Tyre" in the Word, as may be evident from the particulars concerning it in this chapter and in the eighteenth following, when understood in the spiritual sense. And as the knowledges of the truth and good of the church are signified by "Tyre," a ship is therefore described as to the particulars of it, and by each one is signified some quality of those knowledges that conduces to intelligence. What has the Word in common with the ships of Tyre and its commerce?</p><p>[3] The devastation of that church is afterwards described thus:<p>At the voice of the cry of thy shipmasters the suburbs shall quake, and all that hold an oar shall descend from thy ships, all mariners and shipmasters of the sea shall cry out bitterly upon thee, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_27_28.htm">Ezekiel 27:28-30</a>; also <a href="3927/isaiah_23_14.htm">Isaiah 23:14-15</a>).<p>The devastation of Babylon as to all the knowledges of truth is similarly described in what follows in Revelation:<p>In one hour are so great riches devastated; every pilot and everyone employed upon ships, and the sailors, shall cry out, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, in which all who have ships in the sea were made rich, (<a href="3927/revelation_18_17.htm">Revelation 18:17</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_18_19.htm">19</a>).</p><p>[4] See the explanation below. The knowledges of truth and good are also signified by "ships" in the following passages:<p>My days were swift, they fled away, they saw not good, they passed by with the ships of desire, (<a href="3927/job_9_25.htm">Job 9:25-26</a>).<p>They that go down to the sea in ships, that do work in many waters, these see the works of Jehovah, and His wonders in the deep, (<a href="3927/psalms_107_23.htm">Psalms 107:23-24</a>).<p>The isles shall trust in Me, and the ships of Tarshish in the beginning, to bring thy children from afar, (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_9.htm">Isaiah 60:9</a>).<p>The kings gathered themselves together, terror seized them; thou shalt break the ships of Tarshish by the east wind, (<a href="3927/psalms_48_4.htm">Psalms 48:4-7</a>).<p>Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, (<a href="3927/isaiah_23_1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_23_14.htm">14</a>; besides other places, as <a href="3927/numbers_24_24.htm">Numbers 24:24</a>; <a href="3927/judges_5_17.htm">Judges 5:17</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_104_26.htm">Psalms 104:26</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_33_21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 406 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>406. "Et tertia pars navium periit," significat quod omnes cognitiones boni et veri ex Verbo inservientes pro usu vitae, apud illos deperditae essent. - "Tertia pars" significat omne, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_406/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_400" target=_top>400</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_406/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_404" target=_top>404</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_406/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_405" target=_top>405</a>); "naves" significant cognitiones boni et veri ex Verbo inservientes pro usu vitae; quod illae per "naves" significentur, est quia naves transeunt mare, et apportant necessaria, quae naturali homini pro omni ejus usu sunt, et cognitiones boni et veri sunt necessaria, quae spirituali homini pro omni usu ejus sunt; ex illis enim est doctrina Ecclesiae, et secundum illam vita. "Naves" significant cognitiones illas, quia sunt continentes, et in Verbo continens multis in locis sumitur pro contento, ut poculum pro vino, patina pro cibo, tabernaculum et templum pro sanctitatibus in illis, arca pro lege, altaria pro cultu, et sic porro.
