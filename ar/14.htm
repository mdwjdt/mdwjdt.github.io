<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第14节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>14.“和祂宝座前的七灵”表来自整个天堂，主在那里处于其神性真理，其神性真理被接受。“七灵”是指所有处于神性真理的人，在抽象意义上，是指神性真理本身或真理本身。在圣言中，“七”是指所有人和所有事物，这一点可参看上文（<a href="10.htm">10</a>节）；“宝座”是指整个天堂，这一点可参看下文。故“祂宝座前”是指祂的神性真理所在之处。因为天堂之为天堂，不是因为适合天使的东西，而是因为主的神性。这一点在《圣治》和《圣爱与圣智》多有说明。以下经文表明“主的宝座”是指天堂：</p><p>耶和华说，天是我的宝座。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.1.htm">66:1</a>）</p><p>耶和华在天上立定宝座。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗103.19.htm">103:19</a>）</p><p>指着天起誓的，就是指着神的宝座和那坐在上面的起誓。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.22.htm">23:22</a>）</p><p>在基路伯头以上的穹苍之上仿佛有宝座的形像，好像蓝宝石的样子，在宝座上有仿佛人的形状。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.26.htm">1:26</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结10.1.htm">10:1</a>）</p><p>“基路伯头以上的穹苍”是指天堂。启示录：</p><p>得胜的，我要赐他坐在我的宝座上。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.21.htm">3:21</a>）</p><p>“在我的宝座上”是指在天堂，具体而言，就是祂的神性真理所居之处。因此，在论述审判的地方，经上说主将坐在宝座上，因为审判由真理来施行。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 14</h4><p>14. And from the seven spirits who are before His throne. This symbolically means, from the whole of heaven, where the Lord is in His Divine truth, and where His Divine truth is received.<p>The seven spirits mean all who are governed by Divine truth, and in an abstract sense, Divine truth itself. The number seven in the Word means all things or all people, as may be seen in no. <a href="10.htm">10</a> above, and the throne means the whole of heaven, as will be seen shortly. Therefore "before His throne" means where His Divine truth is; for heaven is not heaven in consequence of the angels' own qualities, but owing to the Lord's Divinity, as we have shown many times in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Providence and Divine Love and Wisdom.<p>That the Lord's throne symbolizes heaven is apparent from the following passages:<p>Thus said Jehovah: "The heavens are My throne...." (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>)<p>Jehovah has established His throne in the heavens... (<a href="3927/psalms_103_19.htm">Psalms 103:19</a>)<p>He who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God... (<a href="3927/matthew_23_22.htm">Matthew 23:22</a>)<p>Above the firmament that was over the head (of the cherubim), in appearance like a sapphire stone, was the likeness of a throne, and on (it)...the appearance of a man... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>, cf. <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>)<p>The expanse over the head of the cherubim means heaven. Further, in the book of Revelation:<p>To him who overcomes I will grant to sit... on My throne... (<a href="3927/revelation_3_21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>)<p>To be on His throne means to be in heaven. Specifically it means to be where His Divine truth reigns. Consequently, where judgment is the subject, it is also said that the Lord will sit upon His throne, for judgment is effected by means of truths. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 14</h4><p>14. 'And from the seven spirits who are before the throne' signifies from the entire heaven, where the Lord is in His Divine Truth, and His Divine Truth is received. By 'the seven spirits' are understood all who are in Divine Truth, and in an abstract sense Divine Truth (Verum) or the Truth (Veritas) itself. That by 'seven' all people and all things are understood, may be seen above (<a href="10.htm">10</a>), and that by 'throne' is understood the entire heaven will be seen presently. Consequently by 'before the throne' is understood where His Divine Truth is; for heaven is not heaven out of the propria of the angels, but out of the Divine of the Lord, as has been shown in many [places] in ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE, and CONCERNING THE DIVINE LOVE. That the Lord's throne signifies heaven, is plain from the following passages:<p>Thus says Jehovah, The heavens [are] My throne. <a href="3927/isaiah_66_1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>.<p>Jehovah in the heavens has strengthened His throne. <a href="3927/psalms_103_19.htm">Psalms 103:19</a>.<p>He who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him Who sits thereon. <a href="3927/matthew_23_22.htm">Matthew 23:22</a>.<p>Above the expanse that was over the head of the cherubs, as it were the appearance of a sapphire stone, the likeness of a throne, and upon it the appearance of a Man. <a href="3927/ezekiel_1_26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>.<p>By 'the expanse over the head of the cherubs' is understood heaven. Also in the Apocalypse:<p>He Who overcomes, I will give him to sit in My thron. <a href="3927/revelation_3_21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>.<p>'In [My] throne' is in heaven, specifically where His Divine Truth reigns. Likewise therefore where the judgment is treated of it is stated that the Lord is going to be seated upon a throne, for the judgment is effected by means of truths. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 14</h4><p>14. And from the seven spirits who are before His throne, signifies, from the whole heaven where the Lord is in His Divine truth, and where His Divine truth is received. By "seven spirits" are meant all who are in the Divine truth, and in the abstract sense, the Divine true or Divine truth itself. That "seven" in the Word means all and all things, may be seen above, (<a href="10.htm">10</a>); and that by "throne" is meant the whole heaven, will be seen presently. Hence by "before His throne," is meant where His Divine truth is; for heaven is not heaven from anything proper to the angels, but from the Divine of the Lord, as is shown in many places in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Providence and the Divine Love and Wisdom. That "the Lord's throne" signifies heaven, is evident from the following passages:<p>Jehovah saith, The heavens are My throne, (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>).<p>Jehovah hath made firm His throne in the heavens, (<a href="3927/psalms_103_19.htm">Psalms 103:19</a>).<p>He that sweareth by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by Him who sitteth thereon, (<a href="3927/matthew_23_22.htm">Matthew 23:22</a>).<p>Above the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim, was as it were, the appearance of a sapphire stone, the likeness of a throne, and upon it the appearance of a Man, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>).<p>By "the expanse over the head of the cherubim" is meant heaven. <p>And in Revelation:<p>He that overcometh, I will give him to sit on My throne, (<a href="3927/revelation_3_21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>).<p>"On my throne," is in heaven; specifically, where His Divine truth reigns; thus also, where judgment is treated of, it is said that the Lord will sit upon a throne, for judgment is performed by truths. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 14 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>14. "Et a septem Spiritibus, qui sunt in conspectu Throni," significat ab universo Caelo, ubi Dominus in Divino Suo Vero est, et Divinum Ipsius Verum recipitur. - Per "septem Spiritus" intelliguntur omnes qui in Divino Vero sunt, et in sensu abstracto ipsum Divinum Verum seu ipsa Divina Veritas; quod per "Septem" in Verbo intelligantur omnes et omnia, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_14/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_10" target=_top>10</a>); et quod per "Thronum" intelligatur universum Caelum, mox videbitur; inde per "in conspectu Throni," intelligitur ubi Ipsius Divinum Verum est; nam Caelum non est Caelum ex propriis Angelorum, sed ex Divino Domini, ut multis ostensum est in Sapientia Angelica de Divina Providentia, et de Divino Amore. Quod "Thronus Domini significet Caelum, patet ex sequentibus locis: <p>"Dixit Jehovah, Caeli Thronus Meus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_14/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_66_1" target=_top>Esaias 66:1</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>"Jehovah in Caelis firmavit Thronum Suum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_14/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_103_19" target=_top>Psalm 103:19</a>); "Qui jurat per Caelum, jurat per Thronum Dei, et per Ipsum Qui sedet super illo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_14/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_23_22" target=_top>Matthaeus 23:22</a>);<p>"Super Expanso, quod super capite Cheruborum, quasi aspectus lapidis Sapphiri, similitudo Throni, et super illo aspectus Homini," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_14/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_1_26" target=_top>Ezechiel 1:26</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_14/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_10_1" target=_top>10:1</a>);<p>per "Expansum super capite Cheruborum" intelligitur Caelum. Et in Apocalypsi: <p>"Vincens, dabo ei sedere in Throno Meo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_14/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_21" target=_top>3:21</a>);<p>"in Throno" est in Caelo; in specie, ubi Divinum Ipsius Verum regnat; quare etiam, ubi de Judicio agitur, dicitur, quod Dominus Sessurus sit super Throno, judicium enim fit per vera.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;1 pro "5" </p>
