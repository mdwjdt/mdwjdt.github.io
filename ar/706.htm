<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第706节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>706.“免得赤身而行，叫他们见他羞耻”表免得他们与那些未处于真理的人同在，也免得他们的地狱之爱显现出来。“赤身而行”表示没有真理的生活。赤身的“羞耻”或私处表示污秽的爱，也就是地狱之爱；经上说“免得叫他们见羞耻”，故表示免得这些爱显现出来。“赤身”表示对真理的无知，“赤身的羞耻”表示地狱之爱（参看<a href="213.htm">213</a>节）。这些话是对那些将属于主的新教会之人说的，好叫他们学习并留在真理中，因为没有真理，他们所具有的先天邪恶，也就是地狱之爱，无法被除去。诚然，缺乏真理的人可以活得像个基督徒，但这只是在世人面前，在天使面前却不是这样。他们要学习的真理涉及主，涉及他们要照之生活的戒律。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 706</h4><p>706. "Lest he walk naked and they see his shame." This symbolically means, so as not to be associated with people who are without any truths, and have their hellish loves appear.<p>To walk naked means, symbolically, to live without truths. The shame of nakedness or private parts symbolizes filthy loves, which are hellish loves. And because the text says, "Lest... they see his shame," it symbolically means, so as not to have those loves appear. That nakedness symbolizes ignorance of truth, and shameful nakedness hellish love, may be seen in no. <a href="213.htm">213</a> above.<p>This admonition is for people who will belong to the Lord's New Church, warning them to learn truths and remain constant in them, since without truths people's innate evils, which are their hellish loves, are not removed. A person without truths may indeed be able to live as a Christian, but he does so in the eyes of men, but not in the eyes of angels.<p>The truths which people are to learn are truths having to do with the Lord and with the precepts according to which they are to live. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 706</h4><p>706. 'Lest he walk naked, and they see his shame' signifies lest they should be with those who are in no truths, and their infernal loves should appear. By 'to walk naked' is signified to live without truths. By 'the shame of nakedness' or the private parts are signified unclean loves, which are infernal loves; and because it is said 'lest they see the shame' there it signified lest those [loves] should appear. That by 'nakedness' is signified ignorance of truth, and by 'shame of nakedness' infernal love, may be seen above (<a href="213.htm">213</a>). These things have been said for those who will be of the Lord's New Church, that they may learn truths and remain in them, since without truths the connate evils they have, which are infernal loves, are not removed. Without truths a man can indeed live as a Christian, but only before men, not before angels. The truths that they will learn are concerning the Lord, and concerning the precepts in accordance with which they will live. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 706</h4><p>706. Lest he walk naked and they see his shame, signifies, lest they should be with those who are in no truths, and their infernal loves should appear. "To walk naked," signifies to live without truths. "The shame of nakedness," or the secret parts, signifies unclean loves, which are infernal loves; and inasmuch as it is said, "lest they see his shame," it signifies lest they should appear. That by "nakedness" is signified ignorance of truth, and by "shame of nakedness" infernal love, see above, (<a href="213.htm">213</a>[1-4]). These things are said for those who will be of the Lord's New Church, that they may learn truths and remain in them, for without truths their connate evils, which are infernal loves, cannot be removed. A man may, indeed, live like a Christian without truths, but this only before men, but not before angels. The truths which they should learn relate to the Lord, and to the commandments according to which they should live. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 706 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>706. "Ut non nudus ambulet et videant pudorem ejus" significat ne sint cum illis qui in nullis veris sunt, et appareant amores infernales eorum. - Per "nudus ambulare" significatur absque veris vivere; per "pudorem nuditatis" seu "pudenda" significantur spurci amores, qui sunt amores infernales; et quia dicitur "ne videant pudorem" significatur ne illi appareant; quod per "nuditatem" significetur ignorantia veri, et per "pudorem nuditatis" amor infernalis, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_706/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_213" target=_top>213</a>). Haec dicta sunt illis qui e Nova Domini Ecclesia erunt, ut discant vera et maneant in illis quoniam absque veris non removentur mala illis connata, quae sunt amores infernales. Homo quidem absque veris potest vivere sicut Christianus, at coram hominibus, sed non coram angelis: vera quae discent, sunt de Domino, et de praeceptis secundum quae vivent. </p>
