<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第18节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>18.“为地上诸王元首的”表教会中源自良善的一切真理都来自祂。这一点从上文可以推知，“诚实作见证的”表主的神性真理本身，“首生的”表主的神性良善本身。因此，“为地上君王元首的”表示教会中源自良善的一切真理都来自祂。这一点之所以由“为地上君王元首的”来表示，是因为就圣言的灵义而言，“君王”表示处于源自良善的真理之人，抽象来说，就是源自良善的真理；而“地”表示教会。这就是“君王”与“地”的含义（参看<a href="20.htm">20</a>，<a href="285.htm">285</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 18</h4><p>18. And the ruler of the kings of the earth. This symbolically means, from whom originates all truth from good in the church.<p>This follows from the preceding, because "a faithful witness" symbolizes the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and "the firstborn" the Lord in respect to Divine good. Thus "the ruler of the kings of the earth" means, symbolically, that from Him originates all truth from good in the church. This is symbolically meant by "the ruler of the kings of the earth" because in the spiritual sense of the Word, kings mean people who possess truths from good, and abstractly, truths from good themselves, and the earth means the church.<p>That these are the symbolic meanings of kings and earth may be seen in nos. <a href="20.htm">20</a> and <a href="285.htm">285</a> below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 18</h4><p>18. 'And Himself the Prince of the kings of the land' signifies from Whom is everything true derived from good in the Church. This follows from earlier statements, since by 'the Faithful Witness' is signified the Lord as to Divine Truth, and by 'the First-born' Himself as to Divine Good. In the same manner by 'the Prince [of the kings] of the land' is signified everything true derived from good in the Church from Himself. This is signified by 'the Prince of the kings of the land' because by 'kings' in the spiritual sense of the Word are understood those who are in truths derived from good, and abstractly truths derived from good, and by 'the land' the Church is understood. That these things are signified by 'kings' and 'the land' may be seen below (<a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="285.htm">285</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 18</h4><p>18. And the prince of the kings of the earth, signifies from whom is all truth from good in the church. This follows from what has gone before, because by faithful witness, the Lord as to the Divine truth is signified; and by first-born the Lord as to the Divine good; therefore by "the prince of the earth," is signified, that all truth from good in the church is from Him. The reason why this is signified by "the prince of the kings of the earth," is, that by "kings" in the spiritual sense of the Word, are meant those that are in truths from good, and abstractly, truths from good; and by "earth" is meant the church. That this is the signification of "kings" and "earth," may be seen below, (<a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="285.htm">285</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 18 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>18. "Et Ipse Princeps regum terrae," significat ex Quo omne verum ex bono in Ecclesia. -Hoc sequitur ex antecedentibus, quia per Testem fidelem significatur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, et per Primogenitum Ipse quoad Divinum Bonum, ita per "Principem (regum) terrae," significatur ab Ipso omne Verum ex Bono in Ecclesia; quod hoc per "Principem regum terrae" significetur, est quia per "Reges" in Sensu spirituali Verbi intelliguntur qui in veris ex bono sunt, et abstracte vera ex bono, et per "terram" intelligitur Ecclesia: quod illi ac illa per "reges" et "terram" significentur, videatur infra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_18/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_20" target=_top>20</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_18/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_285" target=_top>285</a>). </p>
