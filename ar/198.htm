<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第198节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>198.“你要写信给老底嘉教会的天使说”表写给并涉及教会中那些时而出于自己，时而出于圣言相信，并以这种方式亵渎神圣事物的人。不过，有必要先说说这些人。在教会中，有那么一些人既相信，又不信；如，有一位神，圣言是神圣的，有永生，以及许多其它属教会及其教义的事；他们仍不相信。当处于属世感官时，他们就信；当处于属世理性时，他们就不信；因此，当处于外在，因而与其他人来往并交谈时，他们就信；当处于内在，因而不与其他人来往，只是自言自语时，就不信；论到这等人，经上说他们“也不冷也不热”，主要把他们“从口中吐出去”。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 198</h4><p>198. "And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write." (<a href="3927/revelation_3_14.htm">3:14</a>) This symbolically means, to people and concerning people in the church who base their beliefs sometimes on their own thinking, sometimes on the Word, and so profane holy things.<p>But we need first to say something about these people. There are in the church people who both believe and do not believe - who believe, for example, that there is a God, that the Word is holy, that life is eternal, and many other things connected with the church and its doctrine, and yet who at the same time do not believe them. They believe them when they are in their sense-oriented natural self, and yet do not believe them when they are in their reasoning natural self. Thus they believe them when they are focused on things round about them, and so when engaged in association and conversation with others; but do not believe them when they are focused inward, and so when they are not engaged in association with others, and when their conversation then is with themselves. It is these people of whom it is said that they are neither cold nor hot and will be vomited out. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 198</h4><p>198. [verse 14] 'And to the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write' signifies to and concerning those in the Church who believe alternately out of themselves and out of the Word, and in this manner profane holy things.<p>But concerning these something shall be said to begin with. In a Church there are to be found (dantur) those who [both] believe and disbelieve [such things] as, that God exists, that there is the holy Word, that there is eternal life, and many other things that are of the Church and its doctrine. Nevertheless they do not believe. They believe such things when in their natural sensual, but they disbelieve them when in their natural rational thus they believe them when they are in externals, therefore when they are in association and conversation with others, but they disbelieve them when they are in internals, therefore when they are not in association with others, and are then in conversation with themselves. Of these it is said that they are 'neither cold nor hot' and are to be 'spewed out. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 198</h4><p>198. Verse 14. And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, signifies to those and concerning those in the church who alternately believe from themselves, and from the Word, and thus profane things holy. But concerning these something must be premised. There are in the church those who believe and do not believe; as that there is a God, that the Word is holy, that there is eternal life, and many other things which are of the church and its doctrine; and still they do not believe. They believe them when in their natural sensual, but they do not believe when they are in their natural rational; thus they believe them when they are in externals, therefore when they are in society and discourse with others; but they do not believe them when they are in internals, consequently when they are not in society with others, but are discoursing with themselves; concerning these it is said that "they are neither cold nor hot," and that "they shall be vomited out." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 198 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>198. (Vers. 14.) "Et Angelo Ecclesiae Laodicensium scribe," significat ad illos et de illis in Ecclesia, qui alternatim credunt ex se et alternatim ex Verbo, et sic sancta prophanant. - Sed de his aliquid in antecessum dicetur: dantur in Ecclesia qui credunt et non credunt, ut quod Deus sit, Verbum sanctum sit, Vita aeterna sit, et plura quae Ecclesiae et ejus doctrinae sunt, et usque non credunt; credunt illa dum in sensuali naturali suo sunt, attamen non credunt dum in suo rationali naturali sunt ita credunt dum in externis sunt, proinde dum in societate et loquela cum aliis sunt, at non credunt dum in internis sunt, proinde dum non in societate cum aliis sunt, et tunc in loquela secum; de his dicitur quod "nec frigidi nec calidi," et quod "exspuendi sint." </p>
