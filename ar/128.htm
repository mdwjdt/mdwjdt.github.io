<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第128节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>128.“仁爱、事奉”表被称为仁爱及其行为的属灵情感。“仁”是一种属灵的情感，因为仁就是对邻之爱，对邻之爱就是这种情感。“事奉”（Ministry）是仁的行为，因为在圣言中，那些行仁爱之事的人就被称为“仆役”（ministers）。拜神的人有时被称为“用人”（或仆人servant），有时被称为“仆役”。凡处于真理的人，都被称为“神的用人”；凡处于良善的人，都被称为“神的仆役”。这是因为真理服侍良善，良善事奉真理。凡处于真理的人，都被称为“用人”（或仆人servant）（参看<a href="3.htm">3</a>节）；凡处于良善的人，都被称为“仆役”。这一点从以下经文明显可知：</p><p>你们倒要称为耶和华的祭司，我们神的仆役。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.6.htm">61:6</a>）</p><p>我与事奉我的祭司利未人所立的约绝不能废弃。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.21.htm">33:21</a>）</p><p>他们之所以被称为“仆役”（ministers），是因为“祭司”代表主的神性良善。</p><p>你们作祂的诸军，作祂的仆役，遵行祂旨意的，都要称颂耶和华！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗103.21.htm">103:21</a>）</p><p>耶和华以风（spirits）为使者，以火焰为仆役。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.4.htm">104:4</a>）</p><p>作为“风”的“使者”是指那些处于真理的人，作为“仆役”的“使者”是指那些处于良善的人；“火焰”还表示爱之良善。耶稣说：</p><p>谁要为大，就必作你们的仆役；谁要为首，就必作你们的用人。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.26.htm">20:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.27.htm">27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.11.htm">23:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>“仆役”在此论及良善，“用人”则论及真理。以下经文中的“事奉”和“仆役”所表相同（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.6.htm">61:6</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.26.htm">12:26</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.37.htm">12:37</a>等）。因此，很明显，“仁爱、事奉”表属灵情感及其行为。因为良善属乎仁，真理属乎信。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 128</h4><p>128. "'And charity and ministry.'" This symbolizes the spiritual affection called charity, and the practice of it.<p>Charity is a spiritual affection because charity is love for the neighbor, and a love for the neighbor is that affection.<p>Ministry is the practice of it, because in the Word those are called ministers who put into practice things that are matters of charity.<p>In the Word, a worshiper of God is called sometimes a servant, sometimes a minister; and a servant of God is the term used for one who is governed by truths, and a minister of God for one who is governed by goods. The reason is that truth serves good, and good ministers to truth. That servant is a term used for someone governed by truths, see no. <a href="3.htm">3</a> above. That minister, on the other hand, is a term used for someone governed by good is apparent from the following passages:<p>You shall be named the priests of Jehovah, ...the ministers of our God. (<a href="3927/isaiah_61_6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a>)<p>...My covenant will also be broken... with the Levites..., My ministers. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_33_21.htm">Jeremiah 33:21</a>)<p>They are called ministers because priests represented the Lord in relation to Divine good.<p>Bless Jehovah, all you His hosts, His ministers who do His will. (<a href="3927/psalms_103_21.htm">Psalms 103:21</a>)<p>(Jehovah) makes His angels spirits, His ministers a flame of fire. (<a href="3927/psalms_104_4.htm">Psalms 104:4</a>)<p>Angel spirits are ones who are governed by truths, and angel ministers are ones who are governed by goods. A flame of fire also symbolizes the goodness of love.<p>(Jesus said,) "whoever desires to become great..., let him be your minister. And whoever desires to be first..., let him be your servant." (<a href="3927/matthew_20_26.htm">Matthew 20:26-27</a>, cf. <a href="3927/matthew_23_11.htm">23:11-12</a>)<p>"Minister" there refers to good, and "servant" to truth.<p>Ministering and ministry have the same symbolic meaning in <a href="3927/isaiah_56_6.htm">Isaiah 56:6</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_26.htm">John 12:26</a>, <a href="3927/luke_12_37.htm">Luke 12:37</a>, and elsewhere.<p>It is apparent from this that charity and ministry symbolize the spiritual affection called charity and the practice of it. For good is connected with charity, and truth with faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 128</h4><p>128. 'And charity and ministry' signifies the spiritual affection that is called charity, and the working thereof. 'Charity' is the spiritual affection, because charity is love towards the neighbour, and love towards the neighbour is that affection. 'Ministry' is the working thereof, because in the Word they are termed 'ministers' who are doing the things that are of charity. A man worshipping God is sometimes called a 'servant' and sometimes a 'minister,' and he who is in truths is termed 'servant of God,' and he who is in goods 'minister of God.' This is because truth is of service to good, while good ministers to truth. That he who is in truths is termed a 'servant' may be seen above (<a href="3.htm">3</a>); but that he who is in good is termed a minister' is plain from these passages:<p>You shall be called priests of Jehovah, the ministers of your <sup>1</sup>God. <a href="3927/isaiah_61_6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a>.<p>My covenant shall not become ineffectual with the Levites My ministers. <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_21.htm">Jeremiah 33:21</a>.<p>They are called 'ministers' because the priests were representing the Lord as to Divine Good.<p>Bless Jehovah all His hosts, the ministers who do His will. <a href="3927/psalms_103_21.htm">Psalms 103:21-22</a>.<p>Jehovah makes His angels spirits, His ministers a flaming fire. <a href="3927/psalms_104_4.htm">Psalms 104:4</a>.<p>'Angels spirits' are they who are in truths, and 'angels ministers' are they who are in goods; a 'flaming fire' also signifies good of love. Jesus said:<p>Whosoever wishes to be great ought to be your minister, and whosoever wishes to be first ought to be your servant. <a href="3927/matthew_20_26.htm">Matthew 20:26-27</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_23_11.htm">23:11-12</a>.<p>'Minister' is said there of good, and 'servant' of truth. The like is signified by 'ministering' and 'ministry' in <a href="3927/isaiah_56_6.htm">Isaiah 56:6</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_26.htm">John 12:26</a>; <a href="3927/luke_12_37.htm">Luke 12:37</a>; and elsewhere. It is plain from these things that by 'charity and ministry' is signified the spiritual affection and the working thereof; for good is of charity, and truth is of faith.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Hebrew has 'our.' </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 128</h4><p>128. And charity and ministry, signifies the spiritual affection which is called charity, and its operation. Charity is a spiritual affection, because charity is love towards the neighbor, and love towards the neighbor is that affection: that "ministry" is its operation, follows from their being called "ministers" in the Word who do the things which are of charity. The man who is a worshiper of God is sometimes called "a servant," and sometimes a "minister," and he is called "a servant of God" who is in truths, and "a minister of God" who is in goods; the reason is, because truth serves good, and good ministers to truth. That he is called "a servant" who is in truths, may be seen above, (<a href="3.htm">3</a>[1-3]) but that he is called "a minister" who is in good, is evident from these passages:<p>Ye shall be called the priests of Jehovah, the ministers of our <sup>1</sup>God, (<a href="3927/isaiah_61_6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a>).<p>My covenant shall not be broken with the Levites My ministers, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_33_21.htm">Jeremiah 33:21</a>).<p>They are called "ministers," because priests represented the Lord as to Divine good.<p>Bless Jehovah all His hosts, ye ministers of His that do His will, (<a href="3927/psalms_103_21.htm">Psalms 103:21-22</a>).<p>Jehovah maketh His angels spirits; His ministers a flaming fire, (<a href="3927/psalms_104_4.htm">Psalms 104:4</a>).<p>"Angels spirits" are they who are in truths, and "angels ministers" they who are in goods; "flaming fire" also signifies the good of love. Jesus said:<p>Whosoever will be great, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be first, let him be your servant, (<a href="3927/matthew_20_26.htm">Matthew 20:26-27</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_23_11.htm">23:11-12</a>).<p>"Minister" is here predicated of good, and "servant" of truth. The same is signified by "ministering" and "ministry" in <a href="3927/isaiah_61_6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_26.htm">John 12:26</a>; <a href="3927/luke_12_37.htm">Luke 12:37</a> and other places. Hence it is evident, that by "charity" and "ministry," is signified spiritual affection and its operation; for good is of charity, and truth is of faith.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original Latin has "vestri" ("your"). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 128 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>128. "Et charitatem et ministerium," significat actionem spiritualem, quae vocatur charitas, et ejus operationem. - Quod charitas sit affectio spiritualis, est quia charitas est amor erga proximum, et amor erga proximum est illa affectio: quod "ministerium" sit operatio ejus, est quia "ministri" in Verbo dicuntur qui operantur illa quae charitatis sunt. Homo cultor Dei nunc vocatur "servus," nunc "minister;" et "servus Dei" dicitur qui in veris est, ac "minister Dei" qui in bonis; causa est, quia verum inservit bono, ac bonum ministrat vero.
