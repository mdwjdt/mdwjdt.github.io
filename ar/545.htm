<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第545节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>545.“她的孩子被提到神和祂宝座那里去了”表主对该教义的保护，因为它是为了新教会，它由天上的天使来守卫。这句话表示主对该教义的保护，因为前面说“龙就站在那将要生产的妇人面前，等她生产之后，要吞吃她的孩子”；“孩子”和“儿子，男孩”表示为了新教会的教义（<a href="542.htm">542</a>，<a href="543.htm">543</a>节）。这句话还表示由天使来守卫，因为这里说“被提到神和祂宝座那里去了”；“宝座”表示天使天堂（<a href="14.htm">14</a>，<a href="221.htm">221</a>，<a href="222.htm">222</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 545</h4><p>545. And her Child was caught up to God and His throne. This symbolizes the Lord's protection of the doctrine, because it was to be for the New Church, and its being guarded by angels in heaven.<p>This symbolizes the Lord's protection of the doctrine because we are told that the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to give birth, to devour her child as soon as it was born, and the child, or male child, symbolizes doctrine for the New Church (nos. <a href="542.htm">542</a>, <a href="543.htm">543</a>). It symbolizes also the doctrine's being guarded by angels in heaven because we are told that the child was caught up to God and His throne, and His throne symbolizes the angelic heaven (nos. <a href="14.htm">14</a>, <a href="221.htm">221</a>, <a href="222.htm">222</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 545</h4><p>545. 'And her offspring was caught up to God and His throne' signifies the protection of the doctrine by the Lord because it is for the New Church, and its being guarded by means of angels of heaven. By these things the protection of the doctrine by the Lord is signified because it is said that 'the dragon stood before the woman about to bring forth, that after she had brought forth he might devour her offspring,' and by the 'offspring' and the 'male child' is signified the doctrine for the New Church (<a href="542.htm">542-543</a>). Its being guarded also by means of angels of heaven is signified because it is said that it 'was caught up to God and His throne,' and by 'throne' is signified the angelic heaven (<a href="14.htm">14</a>, <a href="221.htm">221-222</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 545</h4><p>545. And her offspring was caught up unto God and His throne, signifies the protection of the doctrine by the Lord, because it is for the New Church, and its being guarded by the angels of heaven. By these words is signified the protection of the doctrine by the Lord, because it is said that "the dragon stood before the woman about to bring forth, to devour her offspring after it was brought forth;" and by "offspring" and "a son, a male" is signified the doctrine for the New Church, (<a href="542.htm">542</a>, <a href="543.htm">543</a>). Being guarded by the angels is also signified, because it is said, that "it was caught up unto God and to His throne;" and by "a throne" is signified the angelic heaven, (<a href="14.htm">14</a>, <a href="221.htm">221</a>, <a href="222.htm">222</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 545 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>545. "Et raptus est fetus ejus ad Deum et Thronum Ipsius," significat tutationem doctrinae, quia pro Nova Ecclesia, a Domino, et custoditionem per Angelos Caeli. - Quod per haec significetur tutatio doctrinae a Domino, est quia dicitur quod "Draco steterit coram Muliere paritura, ut, postquam pepererit, fetum ejus devoraret," ac per "fetum" et per "filium masculum" significatur Doctrina pro Nova Ecclesia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_545/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_542" target=_top>542</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_545/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_543" target=_top>543</a>); quod significetur custoditio etiam per Angelos Caeli, est quia dicitur "quod raptus sit ad Deum et ad Thronum Ipsius," et per "Thronum" significatur Caelum angelicum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_545/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_14" target=_top>14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_545/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_221" target=_top>221</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_545/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_222" target=_top>222</a>). </p>
