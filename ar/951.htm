<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第951节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>951.启22:1.“那些遵行祂诫命的有福了！他们的权柄能在生命树里面，也能从门进城”表那些照主的诫命生活，以便能藉着爱在主里面，主也在他们里面，并能藉着关于祂的认知而在其新教会中的人拥有永恒的幸福。“有福”的表示那些拥有永生幸福的人（<a href="639.htm">639</a>，<a href="852.htm">852</a>，<a href="944.htm">944</a>节）。“遵行祂诫命”表示照主的诫命生活；“他们的权柄能在生命树里面”表示以便藉着爱，也就是为了主的缘故，他们能在主里面，主也在他们里面，如下文所示；“从门进城”表示他们能藉着关于主的认知而在祂的新教会中。新耶路撒冷城墙的“门”表示对出于圣言的良善与真理的认知（<a href="899.htm">899</a>，<a href="900.htm">900</a>，<a href="922.htm">922</a>节）。由于每门都是一颗珍珠，故“门”主要表示对主的认知（<a href="916.htm">916</a>节），“城”或耶路撒冷表示新教会及其教义（<a href="879.htm">879</a>，<a href="880.htm">880</a>节）。</p><p>“他们的权柄在生命树里面”之所以表示以便藉着爱，也就是为了主的缘故，他们能在主里面，主也在他们里面，是因为“生命树”表示主的神性之爱（<a href="89.htm">89</a>，<a href="933.htm">933</a>节）；在这树里面的“权柄”表示来自主的能力，因为他们在里面，主在他们里面；此处和“与主一同掌权”（<a href="284.htm">284</a>，<a href="849.htm">849</a>节）所表相同。那些在主里面，主也在他们里面的人就处于一切能力，以致凡他们所愿意的，他们都能成就，主自己在约翰福音中说：</p><p>住在我里面的，我也住在他里面，这人就多结果子；因为离了我，你们就不能做什么；你们若住在我里面，我的话也就住在你们里面，凡你们所愿意的，祈求，就给你们成就。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.5.htm">15:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.7.htm">7</a>）</p><p>其它福音书同样论到能力（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.7.htm">7:7</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可11.24.htm">11:24</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.9.htm">11:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.10.htm">10</a>）；马太福音：</p><p>耶稣说，你们若有信心，就是对这座山说，你挪开，投在海里；也必成就。你们无论求什么，只要信，就必得着。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.21.htm">21:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.22.htm">22</a>）</p><p>这些话描述了那些在主里面之人的能力；除了来自主的东西外，这些人什么也不想要，什么也不求，凡他们从主那里所愿所求的，就都成就，因为主说“离了我，你们就不能做什么，住在我里面的，我也住在他里面”；天上的天使就具有这种能力，他们要是想要什么，就会得到它。然而，除了有用的外，他们并不想要任何东西，他们貌似凭自己想要这一切，其实仍是靠着主想要的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 951</h4><p>951. <a href="3927/revelation_22_14.htm">22:14</a> Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have their power in the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city. This symbolically means that eternal happiness awaits those who live in accordance with the Lord's commandments, in order that through love, and in His New Church through concepts of Him, they may be in the Lord and have the Lord in them.<p>The blessed symbolize people who possess the felicity of eternal life (nos. <a href="639.htm">639</a>, <a href="852.htm">852</a>, <a href="944.htm">944</a>). To do the Lord's commandments means, symbolically, to live in accordance with His commandments. That they may have their power in the tree of life means, symbolically, in order that through love, that is, for the Lord's sake, they may be in the Lord and have the Lord in them, which we explain below. To enter through the gates into the city means, symbolically, that they may be in the Lord's New Church through concepts of Him. The gates in the wall of the New Jerusalem symbolize concepts of goodness and truth from the Word (nos. <a href="899.htm">899</a>, <a href="900.htm">900</a>, <a href="922.htm">922</a>), and because each gate consisted of a single pearl, the gates symbolize principally concepts of the Lord (no. <a href="916.htm">916</a>). The city, that is, Jerusalem, symbolizes the New Church together with its doctrine (nos. <a href="879.htm">879</a>, <a href="880.htm">880</a>).</p><p>[2] That they may have their power in the tree of life means, symbolically, in order that through love, that is, for the Lord's sake, they may be in the Lord and have the Lord in them, because the tree of life symbolizes the Lord in respect to His Divine love (nos. <a href="89.htm">89</a>, <a href="933.htm">933</a>). And the power in that tree symbolizes power from the Lord, because they are in the Lord and have the Lord in them. The symbolic meaning of this is similar to that of the declaration that they will reign with the Lord (nos. <a href="284.htm">284</a>, <a href="849.htm">849</a>).<p>That people who are in the Lord and have the Lord in them possess all the power needed to be able to do whatever they will, the Lord Himself says in John:<p>He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing... If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. (<a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>, <a href="3927/john_15_7.htm">7</a>)<p>Something similar is said about this power in <a href="3927/matthew_7_7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>, <a href="3927/mark_11_24.htm">Mark 11:24</a>, <a href="3927/luke_11_9.htm">Luke 11:9-10</a>. Indeed, we read in Matthew:<p>Jesus... said..., ."..if you have faith..., ...if you say to this mountain, 'Raise yourself up... cast yourself into the sea,' it will be done. (Indeed,) everything you ask..., believing, you will receive." (<a href="3927/matthew_21_21.htm">Matthew 21:21-22</a>)<p>This describes the power those people have who are in the Lord. They do not wish for and so do not ask for anything that does not come from the Lord; and whatever they wish for and ask from the Lord, this comes to pass, for the Lord says, "without Me you can do nothing. Abide in Me, and I in you." Such is the power that angels in heaven have, that they have only to wish for something in order to obtain it. But still they wish only for things that may be of useful service, wishing this as though of themselves, but in fact from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 951</h4><p>951. [verse 14] 'Blessed are those doing His commandments, that their authority may be in the tree of life, and they may enter in by the gates into the city' signifies that they have eternal happiness who live in accordance with the Lord's precepts to the end that they may be in the Lord and the Lord in them by means of love, and that they may be in His New Church by means of cognitions concerning Him. By the 'blessed' are signified those who have the happiness of eternal life (<a href="639.htm">639</a>, <a href="852.htm">852</a>, <a href="944.htm">944</a>). By 'to do His commandments' is signified to live in accordance with the Lord's precepts. 'That their authority may be in the tree of life' signifies to the end that they may be in the Lord and the Lord in them by means of love, that is, for the sake of the Lord, concerning which [something] follows. By 'to enter in by the gates into the city' is signified that they may be in the Lord's New Church by means of cognitions concerning Him. By 'the gates' of the wall of the New Jerusalem are signified cognitions of good and truth derived from the Word (<a href="899.htm">899-900</a>, <a href="922.htm">922</a>), and because 'each gate was one pearl' the gates principally signify cognitions concerning the Lord (<a href="916.htm">916</a>); and by 'the city,' or Jerusalem, is signified the New Church with its doctrine (<a href="879.htm">879-880</a>).</p><p>[2] The reason why by 'that their authority may be in the tree of life' is signified to the end that they may be in the Lord and the Lord in them, or for the sake of the Lord, is because by 'the tree of life' is signified the Lord as to Divine Love (<a href="89.htm">89</a>, <a href="933.htm">933</a>), and by 'authority in that tree' is signified authority from the Lord because they are in the Lord and the Lord in them. By these words something similar is signified as by [the statement] that they are going to reign with the Lord (<a href="284.htm">284</a>, <a href="849.htm">849</a>). That those who are in the Lord and the Lord in them have all authority, to the extent that whatever they will they are able to do, the Lord Himself says in John:<p>He who abides in Me and I in him, this one bears much fruit, because without Me you cannot do anything: if you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, even so shall it be done unto you. <a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>, <a href="3927/john_15_7.htm">7</a>.<p>In like manner concerning authority (<a href="3927/matthew_7_7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>; <a href="3927/mark_11_24.htm">Mark 11:24</a>; <a href="3927/luke_11_9.htm">Luke 11:9-10</a>); indeed in Matthew:<p>Jesus said, If you were to have faith, if you say to this mountain, Rise up, cast thyself into the sea, it shall be done; indeed all the things that you ask believing, you shall get. <a href="3927/matthew_21_21.htm">Matthew 21:21-22</a>.<p>By these words is described the authority of those who are in the Lord. They do not will anything, and so do not seek anything, except from the Lord, and whatever they will and ask from the Lord, the same is done, for the Lord says, 'Without Me you cannot do anything, abide in Me and I in you.' The angels in heaven have such authority that if only they will a thing they obtain it; but yet they do not will anything but what is of use, and they will this as from themselves, but still from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 951</h4><p>951. Verse 14. Happy are they that do His commandments, that their power may be in the tree of life, and they may enter in through the gates into the city, signifies that they have eternal felicity who live according to the Lord's commandments, to the end that they may be in the Lord and the Lord in them by love, and in His New Church by knowledges concerning Him. By "happy" are signified they who have the felicity of eternal life, (<a href="639.htm">639</a>, <a href="852.htm">852</a>, <a href="944.htm">944</a>). By "doing His commandments," is signified to live according to the Lord's precepts; "that their power may be in the tree of life," signifies to the end that they may be in the Lord and the Lord in them by love, that is, for the Lord's sake, as will be shown presently; by "entering through the gates into the city" is signified that they may be in the Lord's New Church through knowledges concerning Him. By "the gates" of the wall of the New Jerusalem are signified the knowledges of good and truth from the Word, (<a href="899.htm">899</a>, <a href="900.htm">900</a>, <a href="922.htm">922</a>). And because "each gate was one pearl," principally by "gates" are signified knowledges concerning the Lord, (<a href="916.htm">916</a>[1-2]); and by "the city," or Jerusalem, is signified the New Church with its doctrine, (<a href="879.htm">879-880</a>).</p><p>[2] That by "their power is in the tree of life," is signified to the end that they may be in the Lord and the Lord in them, or for the Lord's sake, is because by "the tree of life" is signified the Lord as to the Divine love, (<a href="89.htm">89</a>, <a href="933.htm">933</a>); and by "power in that tree" is signified power from the Lord, because they are in the Lord and the Lord in them; the same is signified here as by "reigning with the Lord" (<a href="284.htm">284</a>, <a href="849.htm">849</a>). That they who are in the Lord and the Lord in them are in all power, insomuch that whatsoever they will, they can do, the Lord Himself says in John:<p>He that abideth in Me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without Me ye can do nothing; if ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you, (<a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>, <a href="3927/john_15_7.htm">7</a>).<p>In like manner concerning power, (<a href="3927/matthew_7_7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>; <a href="3927/mark_11_24.htm">Mark 11:24</a>; <a href="3927/luke_11_9.htm">Luke 11:9-10</a>); yea, in Matthew:<p>Jesus said, If ye have faith, ye shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done. And all things whatsoever ye shall ask believing, ye shall receive, (<a href="3927/matthew_21_21.htm">Matthew 21:21-22</a>).<p>By these words is described the power of those who are in the Lord; these do not will anything, and so do not ask anything, but from the Lord, and whatsoever they will and ask from the Lord, the same is done, for the Lord says, "Without Me ye can do nothing, abide in Me and I in you;" such power have the angels in heaven, that if they only will a thing, they obtain it; but yet they do not will anything but what is of use, and this they will as if from themselves, but still from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 951 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>951. (Vers. 14.) "Beati facientes mandata Ipsius, ut sit potestas illorum in Arbore vitae, et portis ingrediantur in Urbem," significat quod felicitas aeterna sit illis qui vivunt secundum praecepta Domini, propter finem ut sint in Domino et Dominus in illis per amorem, et in Nova Ipsius Ecclesia per cognitiones de Ipso. - Per "beatos" significantur quibus felicitas vitae aeternae est (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_639" target=_top>639</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_852" target=_top>852</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_944" target=_top>944</a>); per "facere mandata Ipsius" significatur vivere secundum praecepta Domini; "ut sit potestas illorum in Arbore vitae," significat ob finem ut sint in Domino et Dominus in illis per amorem, hoc est, propter Dominum, de quo sequitur; per' "portis ingredi in Urbem," significatur ut sint in Nova Domini Ecclesia per cognitiones de Ipso; per "portas" muri Novae Hierosolymae significantur cognitiones boni et veri ex Verbo (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_899" target=_top>899</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_900" target=_top>900</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_922" target=_top>922</a>); et quia "unaquaevis porta erat una margarita, principaliter per "portas" significantur cognitiones de Domino (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_916" target=_top>916</a>), et per "Urbem," seu Hierosolymam, significatur Nova Ecclesia cum Doctrina ejus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_879" target=_top>879</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_880" target=_top>880</a>). Quod per "ut sit potestas illorum in Arbore vitae," significetur propter finem ut sint in Domino et Dominus in illis, seu propter Dominum, est quia per "Arborem vitae" significatur Dominus quoad Divinum Amorem (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_89" target=_top>89</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_933" target=_top>933</a>); et per "potestatem in illa Arbore" significatur potestas a Domino, quia in Domino sunt et Dominus in illis; per haec simile significatur per quod "regnaturi cum Domino (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_284" target=_top>284</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_849" target=_top>849</a>). Quod qui in Domino sunt et Dominus in illis in omni potestate sint, adeo ut quicquid volunt, possint, Ipse Dominus dicit apud Johannem: <p>"Qui manet in Me et Ego in illo, hic fert fructum multum, quia sine Me non potestis facere quicquam: si manseritis in Me, et verba Mea in vobis, quicquid volueritis, petatis, etiam fiet vobis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_5" target=_top>15:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_7" target=_top>7</a>);<p>(Similiter de potestate, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_7_7" target=_top>Matthaeus 7:7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_11_24" target=_top>Marcus 11:24</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_11_9-10" target=_top>Luca 11:9-10</a>;) <p>imo apud Matthaeum: <p>"Jesus dixit, Si haberetis fidem, si monti huic dixeritis, Tollere, projice te in mare, fiet; imo, omnia quae petieritis credentes accipietis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_951/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_21_21-22" target=_top>21:21-22</a>);<p>per haec describitur potestas illorum qui in Domino sunt; hi non aliquid volunt, et sic non aliquid petunt, nisi a Domino; et quicquid volunt et petunt a Domino, hoc fit; nam dicit Dominus, "Sine Me non potestis facere quicquam; manete in Me et Ego in vobis;" talis potestas est angelis in Caelo, ut modo velint, obtineant; sed usque non volunt quicquam quam quod usui est, et hoc volunt sicut a se, sed usque a Domino. </p>
