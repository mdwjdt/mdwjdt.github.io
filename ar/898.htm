<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第898节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>898.启21:12.“有高大的墙”表新教会的教义所来自的字义中的圣言。当“圣城耶路撒冷”表示主的新教会教义时，其“墙”无非表示教义所来自的字义中的圣言；因为字义保护隐藏在里面的灵义，就像城墙保护一座城及其居民一样。字义是灵义的基础、容器和支撑，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/27.htm">27</a>-36节）。字义是守卫，免得内在神性真理，也就是灵义的真理，受到伤害（<a href="../ss/97.htm">97</a>节）。教义的教义要取自圣言的字义，并被字义所确认（<a href="../ss/50.htm">50</a>-61节）。经上之所以称墙“高大”，是因为所指的是圣言的神性良善和神性真理；“大”论及良善，“高”论及真理，如前所述（<a href="896.htm">896</a>节）。</p><p>“墙”表示保护之物；在以下经文中，在论及教会时，“墙”表示字义中的圣言：</p><p>耶路撒冷啊，我在你城墙上设立守望的；他们昼夜必不静默，呼吁耶和华。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.6.htm">62:6</a>）</p><p>他们要称你为耶和华的城，为以色列圣者的锡安；你必称你的墙为拯救，称你的门为赞美。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.14.htm">60:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.18.htm">18</a>）</p><p>耶和华要作四围的火墙，并要作其中的荣耀。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.5.htm">2:5</a>）</p><p>亚发人在你四围的墙上，歌玛底人把自己的盾牌悬挂在你四围的城墙上，使你全然美丽。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.11.htm">27:11</a>）</p><p>这论及推罗，推罗表示教会对来自圣言真理的认知。</p><p>你们当在耶路撒冷的街上跑来跑去，看看有一人求真理没有；你们要上她的墙，施行毁坏。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 5.1.htm"> 5:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 5.10.htm">10</a>） </p><p>耶和华定意拆毁锡安女子的城墙，祂使外郭和城墙都悲哀，它们便一同衰败，不再有律法和先知。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.8.htm">2:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.9.htm">9</a>） </p><p>它们在城里跑来跑去，蹿上墙，爬上房屋，从窗户进入。（约珥2:9）</p><p>这些论及真理的歪曲。</p><p>恶人日夜在城里绕行，他们中间尽是毁坏。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗55.10.htm">55:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗55.11.htm">11</a>）</p><p>此外还有其它地方（如以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.5.htm">22:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛56.5.htm">56:5</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶1.15.htm">1:15</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.11.htm">27:11</a>；耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.7.htm">2:7</a>）。</p><p>“墙”表示字义中的圣言，这一点从本章接下来的经文很清楚地看出来，那里详细论述了墙、墙上的门、根基和相关尺寸。原因在于，“城”所表示的新教会教义唯独来自圣言的字义。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 898</h4><p>898. <a href="3927/revelation_21_12.htm">21:12</a> It had a great and high wall. This symbolizes the Word in its literal sense from which the doctrine of the New Church comes.<p>Since the holy city Jerusalem means the Lord's New Church in respect to its doctrine, its wall can only mean the Word in its literal sense, from which its doctrine comes; for the literal sense protects the spiritual meaning that lies within, as a wall protects a city and its inhabitants.<p>That the literal sense is the foundation, containing vessel, and buttress of the Word's spiritual meaning may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="../ss/27.htm">27-36</a>; and that the literal sense serves as a safeguard to keep the Divine truths within from being injured - truths which constitute the Word's spiritual meaning - may be seen in no. <a href="../ss/97.htm">97</a> of the same work. Also, that the church's doctrine is to be drawn from the Word's literal sense and verified by it, in nos. <a href="../ss/50.htm">50-61</a> there.<p>The wall is said to be great and high because it means the Word in respect to its Divine goodness and Divine truth, for greatness is predicated of goodness, and height of truth, as in no. <a href="896.htm">896</a> above.</p><p>[2] A wall symbolizes something that protects, and when mentioned in reference to the church, it symbolizes the Word in its literal sense, as it does also in the following places:<p>I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; they shall not keep silent day or night, who make mention of Jehovah... (<a href="3927/isaiah_62_6.htm">Isaiah 62:6</a>)<p>They shall call you the City of Jehovah, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel... And you shall call your walls salvation, and your gates praise. (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_14.htm">Isaiah 60:14</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_60_18.htm">18</a>)<p>(Jehovah) will be a wall of fire all around her, and... the glory in her midst. (<a href="3927/zechariah_2_5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>)<p>Men of Arvad... were on your walls..., and the men of Gammad... hung their shields on your walls all around, and made your beauty perfect. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_27_11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>)<p>The last is said of Tyre, which symbolizes the church in respect to its concepts of truth from the Word.<p>Run about through the streets of Jerusalem, and see... if there is anyone who... seeks the truth... Go up on her walls and cast them down. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_5_1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_10.htm">10</a>)<p>Jehovah has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion... ...He has caused the rampart and wall... to lament, to languish together... The Law and her prophets are no more... (<a href="3927/lamentations_2_8.htm">Lamentations 2:8-9</a>)<p>They will run about in the city, they will run on the wall; they will climb up into the houses, they will enter through the windows... (<a href="3927/joel_2_9.htm">Joel 2:9</a>)<p>These passages refer to falsifications of truth.<p>Day and night (the impious) go around (in the city) on its walls... Destructions are in their midst. (<a href="3927/psalms_55_10.htm">Psalms 55:10-11</a>)<p>And so on elsewhere, as in <a href="3927/isaiah_22_5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_56_5.htm">56:5</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_1_15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>; <a href="3927/lamentations_2_7.htm">Lamentations 2:7</a>.<p>That a wall symbolizes the Word in its literal sense is clearly apparent from the following verses in the present chapter, which describe at some length the wall of the city and its gates, foundations and dimensions. That is because the doctrine of the New Church, which the city symbolizes, comes only from the Word's literal sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 898</h4><p>898. [verse 12] 'Having a great and high wall' signifies the Word in the sense of the letter from which the doctrine of the New Church will be derived. When by 'the holy city Jerusalem' is understood the Lord's New Church as to doctrine, by its 'wall' nothing else is understood but the Word in the sense of the letter from which the doctrine is derived, for that sense protects the spiritual sense which is concealed within just as a wall protects a city and its inhabitants. That the sense of the letter is the basis, the containant and the support of its spiritual sense may be seen in <a href="../ss/27.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 27-36</a>; and that that sense is a guard lest the interior Divine Truths that are of its spiritual sense should be harmed (<a href="97.htm">97</a> there); also that the Church's doctrine is to be drawn out of the sense of the letter of the Word, and confirmed by it (<a href="50.htm">50-65</a> there). It is said 'a great and high wall' because there is understood the Word as to Divine Good and Divine Truth, for 'great' is predicated of good and 'high' of truth, as above (<a href="896.htm">896</a>).</p><p>[2] By 'a wall' is signified that which protects, and where it concerns the Church it signifies the Word in the sense of the letter in the following passages also:<p>I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem; by day and night they shall not be silent, making mention of Jehovah. <a href="3927/isaiah_62_6.htm">Isaiah 62:6</a>.<p>They shall call thee the city of Jehovah, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel, and thou shalt call thy walls salvation, and thy gates praise. <a href="3927/isaiah_60_14.htm">Isaiah 60:14</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_60_18.htm">18</a>.<p>Jehovah shall be for a wall of fire round about, and for the glory in the midst of her, <a href="3927/zechariah_9_5.htm">Zechariah 9:5</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/zechariah_9_9.htm">9</a>].<p>The sons of Arvad are upon thy walls, and the Gammadians have hung their shields upon the walls round about, and they have perfected thy beauty. <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>; these things being said concerning Tyre, by which is signified the Church as to the cognitions of truth derived from the Word.<p>Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see if there is [any one] seeking the truth (veritas); go up onto her walls, and cast down. <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_10.htm">10</a>.<p>Jehovah has thought to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion, He has made the rampart and the wall to mourn, they languish together; the law and the prophets are no more, <a href="3927/lamentations_2_8.htm">Lamentations 2:8-9</a>.<p>They shall run to and fro in the city, they shall run on the wall, they shall climb up into the houses, they shall get in through the windows. <a href="3927/joel_2_9.htm">Joel 2:9</a>; these things concerning the falsifications of truth.<p>Day and night the wicked go about in the city upon its walls, destructions are in the midst of it. <a href="3927/psalms_55_10.htm">Psalms 55:10-11</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_55_11.htm">11-12</a>]; besides elsewhere, as <a href="3927/isaiah_22_5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_56_5.htm">56:5</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_1_15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>; <a href="3927/lamentations_2_7.htm">Lamentations 2:7</a>. That the Word in the sense of the letter is signified by 'a wall' is quite plain from the following things of this chapter, which treat much of the wall, its gates, foundations and measurements. This is because the doctrine of the New Church, which is signified by 'the city,' is solely derived from the sense of the letter of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 898</h4><p>898. Verse 12. Having a wall great and high, signifies the Word in the sense of the letter from which is the doctrine of the New Church. When the Lord's New Church as to doctrine is meant by "the holy city Jerusalem," nothing else is meant by its "wall" but the Word in the sense of the letter, from which the doctrine is; for that sense protects the spiritual sense, which lies hidden within, as the wall does a city and its inhabitants. That the sense of the letter is the basis, the containant, and the support of its spiritual sense, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, (<a href="27.htm">27-36</a>) And that this sense is the guard, lest the interior Divine truths, which are those of the spiritual sense, should be injured, (<a href="97.htm">97</a> Also that the doctrine of the church is to be drawn from the sense of the letter of the Word, and to be confirmed by it, (<a href="50.htm">50-61</a>). It is called "a wall great and high," because the Word is meant as to the Divine good and the Divine truth; for "great" is predicated of good, and "high" of truth, as above, (<a href="896.htm">896</a>).</p><p>[2] By "a wall" is signified that which protects; and, in speaking of the church, the Word in the sense of the letter is signified in the following passages:<p>I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem; they shall not be silent day and night, that make mention of Jehovah, (<a href="3927/isaiah_62_6.htm">Isaiah 62:6</a>).<p>They shall call thee the city of Jehovah, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel; and thou shalt call thy walls salvation, and thy gates praise, (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_14.htm">Isaiah 60:14</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_60_18.htm">18</a>).<p>Jehovah will be a wall of fire round about, and a glory in the midst of her, (<a href="3927/zechariah_2_5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>).<p>The sons of Arvad were upon thy walls, and the Gammadians hung their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_27_11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>).<p>This is concerning Tyre, by which is signified the church as to knowledges of truth from the Word.<p>Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see if there is any that seeketh truth; go up on her walls, and cast down, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_5_1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_10.htm">10</a>).<p>Jehovah hath thought to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion, He made the rampart and the wall to mourn, they languish together, the law and the prophets are no more, (<a href="3927/lamentations_2_8.htm">Lamentations 2:8-9</a>).<p>They shall run to and fro in the city, they shall run on the wall, they shall go up into the houses, they shall enter in through the windows, (<a href="3927/joel_2_9.htm">Joel 2:9</a>).<p>These are concerning the falsifications of truth:<p>Day and night the wicked go about in the city, upon its walls, destructions are in the midst of them, (<a href="3927/psalms_55_10.htm">Psalms 55:10</a> Besides other places, as <a href="3927/isaiah_22_5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_56_5.htm">56:5</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_1_15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>; <a href="3927/lamentations_2_7.htm">Lamentations 2:7</a>. That the Word in the sense of the letter is signified by "a wall," is clearly manifest from what follows in this chapter, where the wall, its gates, foundations, and measures are much treated of. The reason is, because the doctrine of the New Church, which is signified by "the city," is solely from the sense of the letter of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 898 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>898.
