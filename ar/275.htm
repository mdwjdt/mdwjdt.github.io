<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第275节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>275.“四活物和二十四位长老就俯伏在羔羊面前”表出于高层天堂的谦卑和由于谦卑而对主的敬拜。现在可知，主因施行审判而得颂赞，因为如前所述（<a href="263.htm">263</a>节），若非主现在施行最后审判，由此使天上和地上的一切事物恢复秩序，所有人都必灭亡。对主的颂赞先从高层天堂开始，然后是低层天堂，最后是最低层天堂；高层天堂的颂赞（8-10节）；低层天堂的颂赞（11-12节）；最低层天堂的颂赞（13节）；最后是高层天堂的确认和崇拜（14节）。因此，“四活物”和“二十四位长老”表示高层天堂；因为基路伯，也就是“在宝座中间”的四活物，表示主的圣言；而“基路伯”或“在宝座周围”的四活物表示天堂的圣言。因为经上说：</p><p>宝座中间和宝座周围有四个活物，前后都长满了眼睛。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.6.htm">4:6</a>）</p><p>因为天堂因经由圣言从主接受神性真理而为天堂。“二十四位长老”也表示高层天堂的天使，因为这些长老最接近宝座周围（｛4:4）。显然，“俯伏在羔羊面前”是谦卑，并出于谦卑敬拜。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 275</h4><p>275. The four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. This symbolizes a humility and out of humility worship of the Lord on the part of the higher heavens.<p>There follows now a glorification of the Lord on account of the foregoing, for as we said in no. <a href="263.htm">263</a> above, if the Lord had not executed a last judgment and thereby put back into order everything in heaven and on earth, all would have perished.<p>The glorification of the Lord that follows now comes first from the higher heavens, then from the lower heavens, and finally from the lowest heavens - from the higher heavens in verses <a href="3927/revelation_5_8.htm">8-10</a>, from the lower heavens in verses 11, 12, and from the lowest heavens in verse <a href="3927/revelation_5_13.htm">13</a>. And lastly there is a confirmation and worship by the higher heavens in verse <a href="3927/revelation_5_14.htm">14</a>.<p>The higher heavens, then, are symbolically meant by the four living creatures and twenty-four elders, for cherubim in the midst of the throne - which the four living creatures are - symbolize the Lord in relation to the Word, while the cherubim around the throne, or the four living creatures, symbolize heaven in relation to the Word. For we are told that "in the midst of the throne, and around the throne," John saw "four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back" (chapter 4, <a href="3927/revelation_4_6.htm">4:6</a>). That is because the heavens are heavens in consequence of their reception of Divine truth from the Lord through the Word.<p>The twenty-four elders, too, symbolize angels in the higher heavens, since these elders were the closest ones around the throne (chapter 4, <a href="3927/revelation_4_4.htm">4:4</a>).<p>To fall down before the Lamb clearly means humility, and out of humility, worship. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 275</h4><p>275. 'The four animals and the twenty-four elders fell prostrate before the Lamb' signifies a humbling, and as a result of the humbling the adoration of the Lord out of the higher heavens. Now follows a glorification of the Lord on account of [the intended judgment], for, as was said above (<a href="263.htm">263</a>), unless the Lord should now effect the last judgment, and by means of it bring all things in the heavens and on earth (in terris) back into order, they would all perish. The glorification of the Lord which now follows is made first from the higher heavens, afterwards from the lower heavens, and only then from the lowest heavens; glorification from the higher heavens (verses 8-10), from the lower heavens (verses 11-12), and from the lowest heavens (verse 13), and at length confirmation and adoration from the higher heavens (verse 14). The higher heavens, therefore, are signified by 'the four animals and the twenty-four elders'; for, by the cherubs which the four animals are 'in the midst of the throne' is signified the Lord as to the Word, while by the cherubs or four animals 'around the throne' is signified heaven as to the Word, for it is said that 'in the midst of the throne and around the throne' were seen 'four animals, full of eyes before and behind' (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_4_6.htm">4:6</a>); for the heavens are heavens by virtue of the reception of Divine Truth by means of the Word from the Lord. By 'the twenty-four elders' also are signified the angels in the higher heavens, because those elders were nearest around the throne (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_4_4.htm">4:4</a>). That 'to fall prostrate before the Lamb' is a humbling, and as a result of the humbling an adoration, is plain. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 275</h4><p>275. The four animals and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, signifies humiliation, and from humiliation, adoration of the Lord from the higher heavens. Now follows the glorification of the Lord on the above account, for, as was observed above, (<a href="263.htm">263</a>), unless the Lord should now execute the Last Judgment, and thereby reduce all things in the heavens and in the earths to order, all would perish. The glorification of the Lord, which now follows, takes place first in the higher heavens, afterwards in the lower heavens, and lastly in the lowest heavens; the glorification by the higher heavens (verses <a href="3927/revelation_5_8.htm">8-10</a>; by the lower heavens (verses <a href="3927/revelation_5_11.htm">11-12</a>; and by the lowest heavens (verse <a href="3927/revelation_5_13.htm">13</a>); and lastly confirmation and adoration by the higher heavens (verse <a href="3927/revelation_5_14.htm">14</a>). Therefore the higher heavens are signified by the "four animals" and "the twenty-four elders;" for by "the cherubim," which are the four animals "in the midst of the throne," is signified the Lord as to the Word; but by "the cherubim," or four animals "round about the throne," is signified heaven as to the Word; for it is said:<p>That in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were seen four animals, full of eyes before and behind, (<a href="3927/revelation_4_6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>).<p>For the heavens are heavens from the reception of the Divine truth through the Word from the Lord. By "the twenty-four elders" are also signified the angels in the higher heavens, because those elders were nearest around the throne, (<a href="3927/revelation_4_4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>). That "to fall down before the Lamb" is humiliation, and from humiliation, adoration, is evident. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 275 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>275. "Quatuor Animalia et viginti quatuor Seniores prociderunt coram Agno" significat humiliationem, et ex humiliatione adorationem Domini ex superioribus Caelis. Sequitur nunc glorificatio Domini propterea; nam, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_275/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_51" target=_top>51</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_275/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_263" target=_top>263</a>) dictum est, nisi Dominus nunc Ultimum Judicium faceret, et per id redigeret in ordinem omnia in Caelis et in terris, omnes perirent. Glorificatio Domini, quae nunc sequitur, fit primum a Caelis superioribus, postea a Caelis inferioribus, et demum a Caelis infimis: <p>Glorificatio a Caelis superioribus (vers. 8-10);<p>A Caelis inferioribus (vers. 11, 12);<p>Et a Caelis infimis (vers. 13);<p>Et demum confirmatio et adoratio a Caelis superioribus (vers. 14).<p>Caeli itaque superiores significantur per "quatuor Animalia" et per "viginti quatuor Seniores;" nam per "Cherubos," qui sunt quatuor Animalia, "in medio Throni," significatur Dominus quoad Verbum; at per "Cherubos," seu quatuor Animalia, "circum Thronum," significatur Caelum quoad Verbum; dicitur enim, quod "In medio Throni et circum Thronum visa sint quatuor Animalia, plena oculis ante et retro," (iv. vers. 6);<p>Caeli enim sunt Caeli ex receptione Divini Veri per Verbum a Domino. Per "viginti quatuor Seniores" etiam significantur Angeli in Caelis superioribus, quoniam Seniores illi proxime circum Thronum" erant, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_275/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_4_4" target=_top>4:4</a>). Quod "procidere coram Agno" sit humiliatio, et ex humiliatione adoratio, patet. </p>
