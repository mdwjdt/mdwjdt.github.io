<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第186节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>186.“我也必保守你免去试炼的时刻，就是将要临到全世界，来试炼住在地上的人的”表在最后审判之日，他们将得到保护和保守。这些话表示在最后审判之日，他们将得到保护和保守。这一点从《最后的审判》和后来《最后的审判续》这两本书的记载和阐述可以看出来，由这两本书明显可知，经历最后审判的人被引入试探中，以审查他们的品质。内在邪恶的人遭到弃绝，内在良善的人得到拯救。凡通过主处于源自良善的真理之人，其内在都是良善。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 186</h4><p>186. "'I also will keep you from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world, to put to the test those who dwell on the earth.'" This symbolically means that they will be protected and preserved on the day of the Last Judgment.<p>That these words mean the protection and preservation of these people on the day of the Last Judgment may be seen from what we wrote and related concerning the Last Judgment in a small work on that very subject, <sup>1</sup>and later in a continuation concerning it. <sup>2</sup>These make clear that people who underwent the Last Judgment were conveyed into a state of temptation or trial and examined to discover their character, and those who were inwardly evil were rejected, while those who were inwardly good were saved. The inwardly good were people governed by truths springing from goodness derived from the Lord.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Last Judgment, London, 1758.<br><br>2.&nbsp;A Continuation Concerning the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World, Amsterdam, 1763. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 186</h4><p>186. 'I also will keep thee safe from the hour of temptation that is going to come upon the entire world (orbis), to try those dwelling upon the land' signifies that they are to be protected and kept safe in the day of the last judgment. That their protection and safe-keeping in the day of the last judgment is understood by these words can be seen from the things that have been written and related concerning THE LAST JUDGMENT in a special little work, and afterwards in the CONTINUATION CONCERNING IT; from which things it is established that they who have undergone that [judgment] have been let into temptation and had their qualities investigated, and that those who interiorly were evil have been rejected, while those who interiorly were good have been saved; and they were interiorly good who were in truths derived out of good from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 186</h4><p>186. I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth, signifies that they will be protected and preserved in the day of the Last Judgment. That their protection and preservation in the day of the Last Judgment is meant by these words, may be seen from what is written and related concerning The Last Judgment in the work on that subject, and afterwards in The Continuation of the same, from which it is manifest, that they who underwent it were let into temptation, and explored as to their qualities, and that such as were interiorly evil were rejected and such as were interiorly good were saved; and they were interiorly good who were in truths from good from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 186 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>186. "Et Ego te servabo ab hora tentationis futurae venire super orbem universum, explorare habitantes super terra," significat quod tutandi et servandi die Ultimi Judicii. - Quod tutatio et servatio illorum die Ultimi Judicii per illa verba intelligatur, videri potest ex illis, quae de Ultimo Judicio in singulari Opusculo, et postea in Continuatione de illo, scripta et memorata sunt; ex quibus constat, quod qui illud subierunt, in tentationem missi fuerint, et explorati quales essent, et quod rejecti qui interius mali fuerunt, et quod salvati qui interius boni; et interius boni erant, qui in veris ex bono a Domino fuerunt. </p>
