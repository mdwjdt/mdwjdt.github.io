<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第947节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>947.启22:10. “他又对我说，不可封了这书上预言的话，因为日期近了”表启示录绝不可被关闭，而是必须被打开，这在教会终结时是必需的，好叫任何人都有可能得救。稍后会看到，“不可封了这书上预言的话”表示启示录绝不可被关闭，必将被打开；“因为日期近了”表示这是必需的，好叫任何人都有可能得救；“日期”（time，即时间）表示状态（<a href="476.htm">476</a>，<a href="562.htm">562</a>节），在此表示教会的状态，教会的状态已经如此，以致这是必需的；“近了”表示必需或必要，之所以表示必需或必要，是因为“到了”不是指时间近了或接近，而是指状态的接近，状态的接近是必需的；显而易见，不是指时间的接近，因为启示录写于第一世纪初期；而当最后审判发生，并有了新教会（这些事由第6节“日期近了”和“那必要快成的事”，以及第7和20节“我必快来”来表示）时主的到来，才刚刚出现，而且已经过去了17个世纪。第一章也有同样的话，即“必要快成的事”（1:1），“时候近了”（1:3）；对此，参看前文（<a href="4.htm">4</a>，<a href="9.htm">9</a>节），那里也是指这些事。</p><p>有必要说明不是指时间近了或接近，而是指状态的接近。就纯粹的灵义而言，圣言并不从时间观念，也不从空间观念取一物，因为天上的时间和空间并不像世上的时间和空间，其实那里根本没有时间和空间；所以，天使不可能测量时间和空间，那里的时间和空间都是表象，无非是取决于其发展和变化的状态；由此明显可知，就纯粹的灵义而言，“快”和“近了”不是指时间上快了和近了，而是指状态上快了和近了；诚然，这一点看上去并非如此，原因在于，对世人来说，其一切纯属世的低层思维观念都含有源于时空的某种东西；而高层思维观念则不然，当世人在内在理性之光中深思属世、文明、道德和属灵的事时，他们就处于高层思维观念，因为这时，从时空抽离出来的属灵之光流入进来，并进行启示。你若愿意，只需要留意你的思维，就有可能体验到这一点，因而得以确认；这时，你也会信服，思维既有高层的，也有低层的，因为简单的思维若不通过某种高层思维，就无法审视自己；人若没有高层思维和低层思维，就不会是人，而是野兽了。</p><p>“不可封了预言的话”之所以表示启示录绝不可被关闭，必须被打开，是因为“封”表示关闭，故“不可封”表示打开。“日期近了”表示这是必需的；因为启示只要没有被解释，就是一本被封上或关闭的书卷；如前所示（<a href="944.htm">944</a>节），“预言的话”表示主所打开的这书的教义真理和诫命。这在教会终结时是必需的，好叫任何人都有可能得救（参看<a href="9.htm">9</a>节）。由此明显可知，“不可封了这书上预言的话，因为日期近了”表示启示录绝不可被关闭，而是必须被打开，这在教会终结时是必需的，好叫任何人都有可能得救。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 947</h4><p>947. <a href="3927/revelation_22_10.htm">22:10</a> And he said to me, "Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand." This symbolically means that the meaning of the book of Revelation shall not remain hidden, but must be disclosed, and that this is necessary at the end of the church for anyone to be saved.<p>Not sealing the words of the prophecy of this book means, symbolically, that the meaning of the book of Revelation shall not remain hidden, but must be disclosed, as will be explained below. "For the time is at hand" symbolically means that this is necessary for anyone to be saved. Time symbolizes state (nos. <a href="476.htm">476</a>, <a href="562.htm">562</a>), here the state of the church as being such as to make it necessary. To be at hand symbolizes necessity, because to be at hand does not mean nearness or immediacy in time, but nearness in state, and nearness in state means necessity. Plainly it does not mean immediacy in time, because the book of Revelation was written at the beginning of the first century, and the Lord's advent at the time of the Last Judgment and the New Church - meant here by the time being at hand, by things which must shortly take place (verse <a href="3927/revelation_22_6.htm">6</a>), and by the Lord's coming quickly (verses <a href="3927/revelation_22_7.htm">7</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_22_20.htm">20</a>) - has only now, after seventeen centuries, appeared and come into being.<p>The same words as these are found in chapter <a href="3927/revelation_1_1.htm">1</a> - "things which must shortly take place" (<a href="3927/revelation_1_1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>) and "the time is near" (<a href="3927/revelation_1_3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>) - which may be seen explained in nos. <a href="4.htm">4</a> and <a href="9.htm">9</a> above, where they have similar meanings.</p><p>[2] That to be at hand does not mean nearness or immediacy in time, but nearness in state, shall be illustrated. In its purely spiritual sense the Word does not contain anything derived from an idea of time or from an idea of space, because although intervals of time and space in heaven seem like intervals of time and space in the world, still these do not exist there. Consequently it is impossible for angels to measure intervals of time and space there, which are appearances, except in terms of state as these progress and change.<p>It can be seen from this that in a purely spiritual sense immediacy and nearness do not mean an immediacy and nearness in time, but an immediacy and nearness in state.<p>This can admittedly seem to be without reality. That is because every idea of people's lower thought, which is merely natural, contains something derived from time and space. Not so any idea of their higher thought, which people employ when they ponder natural, civic, moral and spiritual matters in the light of their inner, rational sight. For at those times a spiritual light flows in and enlightens, a light that is independent of time and space.<p>You may test this and be convinced if you wish. Simply attend to your own thoughts, and you, too, will then be convinced that you have a higher and lower thought, since a single line of thought is incapable of viewing itself, but can be viewed only by a higher one. Moreover, if a person did not have a higher and lower thought, he would not be human but an animal.</p><p>[3] Not sealing the words of the prophecy of this book means, symbolically, that the meaning of the book of Revelation shall not remain hidden, but must be disclosed, because to seal means to close up, and so not to seal means to open, and the time being at hand means, symbolically, that it is necessary. For the book of Revelation is a book sealed or closed as long as it remains unexplained. Furthermore, as shown in no. <a href="944.htm">944</a> above, the words of the prophecy of this book mean the doctrinal truths and precepts contained in this book, now laid open by the Lord.<p>That this is necessary at the end of the church for anyone to be saved may be seen in no. <a href="9.htm">9</a> above.<p>It can be seen from this that not sealing the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand, means, symbolically, that the book of Revelation shall not remain hidden, but must be disclosed, and that this is necessary at the end of the church for anyone to be saved. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 947</h4><p>947. [verse 10] 'And he says unto me, Do not seal the words of this prophecy, for the time is near' signifies that the Apocalypse is not to be closed up, but must be opened, and that this is necessary at the end of the Church in order that any may be saved. By 'do not seal the words of this prophecy' is signified that the Apocalypse is not to be closed up but must be opened, concerning which [something] follows. By 'for the time is near' is signified that this is necessary in order that any may be saved. By 'time' is signified state (<a href="476.htm">476</a>, <a href="562.htm">562</a>), here that the state of the Church is such that it is necessary. By near' is signified necessary, because by 'near' is not understood near or nearness of time, but nearness of state, and nearness of state is necessity. That nearness of time is not understood is plain, because the Apocalypse was written in the beginning of the first century, and the Lord's coming-when there is the last judgment and the New Church, these being understood here by the time is near' and also by 'the things that must be done quickly' (verse 6) and by 'I am coming quickly' (verse 7, 20)- has appeared and taken place now after seventeen centuries. The same things are said in the first chapter, that those things 'must shortly come to pass' (verse), and that 'the time is near' (verse 3), concerning which the things above (<a href="4.htm">4</a>, <a href="9.htm">9</a>) may be seen.</p><p>[2] By them similar things are understood. That not 'near' or nearness of time but nearness of state is understood, shall be illustrated. The Word in the purely spiritual sense does not derive anything out of the idea of time nor from the idea of space, because the times and spaces in heaven indeed appear like the times and spaces in the world, but still there they are not like them. And therefore the angels cannot measure the times and spaces that are the appearances there otherwise than by means of states, as these proceed and are changed. From which facts it can be established that in the purely spiritual sense by 'quickly' and 'near' are not understood quickly and near of time but quickly and near of state. This can indeed seem as if it were not so. This is because with men in every idea of their lower thought, which is merely natural, there is something derived from time and space. It is otherwise in the idea of the higher thought in which men are when they are meditating about things natural, civil, moral and spiritual in an interior rational light. For then the spiritual light that is withdrawn from time and space inflows and enlightens. You can experience this and thus be confirmed if you will, if only you pay attention to your thoughts. And then you will also confirm that thought is higher and lower, since a simple thought cannot behold itself except from something higher; and if a man did not have a higher and a lower thought, he would not be a man but a brute.</p><p>[3] The reason why by 'do not seal the words of this prophecy' is signified that the Apocalypse is not to be closed up but must be opened is because by' to seal 'is signified to close up, and therefore by 'not to seal' is signified to open; and by 'the time is near is signified that it is necessary. For the Apocalypse is a book sealed or closed up, so long as it has not been expounded; and, as was shown above (<a href="944.htm">944</a>), by 'the words of this prophecy' are understood the truths and precepts of the doctrine of this book opened by the Lord. That this is necessary at the end of the Church in order that any may be saved may be seen above (<a href="9.htm">9</a>). From these considerations it can be established that by 'do not seal the words of this prophecy, for the time is near' is signified that the Apocalypse must not be closed up but opened, and that this is necessary at the end of the Church in order that any maybe saved. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 947</h4><p>947. Verse 10. And he saith unto me, Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand signifies that Revelation must not be shut, but opened, and that this is necessary at the end of the church that any may be saved. By "seal not the words of this prophecy" is signified that Revelation must not be shut, but that it is to be opened, of which presently; "for the time is at hand" signifies that this is necessary that any may be saved; by "time" is signified state, (<a href="476.htm">476</a>, <a href="562.htm">562</a>), here the state of the church, which is such that this is necessary; by "at hand" is signified necessary, because by "at hand" is not meant near or nearness of time, but nearness of state, and nearness of state is necessity; that nearness of time is not meant is evident, because Revelation was written in the beginning of the first century; and the Lord's coming, when the Last Judgment takes place, and there is the New Church, which things are here meant by "the time is at hand," and also by "the things which must be shortly done" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_22_6.htm">6</a>), and by "I come quickly" (verses <a href="3927/revelation_18_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_18_20.htm">20</a>), has now but recently appeared and come to pass after seventeen centuries. The same is also said in chapter 1, that these things "must shortly come to pass," verse 1, and that "the time is at hand," verse 3; concerning which see above, (<a href="4.htm">4</a>, <a href="9.htm">9</a>), where the like things are meant.</p><p>[2] That near or nearness of time is not meant, but nearness of state, shall be illustrated. The Word in the purely spiritual sense does not derive anything from the idea of time nor from the idea of space, because times and spaces in heaven do indeed appear like times and spaces in the world, but still they are not there; wherefore the angels cannot measure times and spaces, which there are appearances, otherwise than by states, according to their progressions and changes; from which it may appear that in the purely spiritual sense by "quickly" and "at hand" is not meant quickly and near as to time, but quickly and near as to state; this may indeed appear as if it were not so, the reason is because with men, in every idea of their lower thought, which is merely natural, there is something from time and space; but it is otherwise in the ideas of the higher thought, in which men are when they revolve natural, civil, moral, and spiritual things in interior rational light, for then spiritual light, which is abstracted from time and space, flows in and enlightens. You may experience this and thus be confirmed, if you will, by only attending to your thoughts; when you will also be convinced that thought is higher and lower, inasmuch as simple thought cannot survey itself, except from some higher thought; and if man did not have a higher and a lower thought, he would not be a man but a brute.</p><p>[3] The reason why by "seal not the words of this prophecy" is signified that Revelation must not be shut, but opened, is because by "sealing" is signified to shut, and therefore by "not sealing" is signified to open, and by "the time is at hand" is signified that it is necessary; for Revelation is a sealed or closed book, so long as it is not explained; and as is shown above, (<a href="944.htm">944</a>), by "the words of this prophecy" are meant the truths and precepts of doctrine of this book opened by the Lord. That this is necessary at the end of the church that any may be saved, may be seen above, (<a href="9.htm">9</a>). From these things it may appear, that by "seal not the words of this prophecy, for the time is at hand," is signified that Revelation must not be closed, but that it is to be opened, and that there is a necessity for this at the end of the church, that any may be saved. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 947 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>947. (Vers. 10) "Et dicit <sup>1</sup>mihi, Ne obsignes verba prophetiae (Libri) hujus, quia tempus prope est," significat quod Apocalypsis non occlusa erit, sed aperienda, et quod hoc necessum sit in fine Ecclesiae, ut aliqui salventur. - Per "non obsignes verba prophetiae hujus" significatur quod Apocalypsis non occlusa erit sed aperienda, de quo sequitur: per "quia tempus prope est," significatur quod hoc necessum sit ut aliqui salventur; per "tempus" significatur status (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_947/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_476" target=_top>476</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_947/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_562" target=_top>562</a>), hic status Ecclesiae quod talis sit ut necessum sit; per "prope" significatur necessum, quia per "prope" non intelligitur prope seu propinquum temporis, sed propinquum status, et propinquum status est necesse: quod non propinquum temporis intelligatur, patet; quia Apocalypsis scripta est principio saeculi primi; et Adventus Domini quando Ultimum Judicium, et Nova Ecclesia, quae hic per "tempus prope est," et quoque per "quae oportet fieri cito" (vers 6), et per "venio cito," (vers. 7, 20), intelliguntur, nunc post septendecim saecula apparuit et exstitit. Eadem haec etiam dicuntur in capite primo, quod illa "oporteat fieri cito," (vers. 1), et quod "tempus prope sit," (vers. 3); de quibus videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_947/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_4" target=_top>4</a> et 9); per quae similia intelliguntur. Quod non intelligatur prope seu propinquum temporis, sed propinquum status, illustrabitur: Verbum in Sensu pure spirituali non aliquid trahit ex idea temporis nec ab idea spatii, quia tempora et spatia in Caelo quidem apparent sicut tempora et spatia in mundo, sed usque ibi non sunt; quare angeli tempora et spatia, quae ibi sunt apparentiae, non possunt metiri aliter quam per status, sicut hi procedunt et mutantur: ex quibus constare potest, quod in Sensu pure spirituali per "cito" et "prope" non intelligatur cito et prope temporis, sed cito et prope status. Hoc quidem potest videri sicut non ita sit; causa est quia apud homines in omni idea cogitationis inferioris eorum, quae est mere naturalis, est aliquid ex tempore et spatio; aliter in idea cogitationis superioris, in qua homines sunt cum volvunt res naturales, civiles, morales et spirituales in luce rationali interiore; tunc enim lux spiritualis, quae abstracta est a tempore et spatio, influit et illustrat. Potes hoc experiri et sic confirmari, si vis, modo attendas ad tuas cogitationes; et quoque tunc confirmaberis quod cogitatio superior et inferior sit, quoniam cogitatio simplex non potest semet intueri, nisi a quadam superiore; et nisi homini foret cogitatio superior et inferior, non foret homo sed brutum. Quod per "Ne obsignes verba prophetiae hujus" significetur quod Apocalypsis non occlusa erit, sed aperienda, est quia per "obsignare" significatur occludere, et inde per "non obsignare" significatur aperire, et per "tempus prope est" significatur quod necessum sit; est enim Apocalypsis Liber obsignatus seu occlusus quamdiu non explicatus est; atque (ut supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_947/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_944" target=_top>944</a> ostensum est) per "verba prophetiae (Libri) hujus" intelliguntur vera et praecepta doctrinae hujus Libri a Domino aperti. Quod hoc necessum sit in fine Ecclesiae, ut aliqui salventur, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_947/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_9" target=_top>9</a>). Ex his constare potest, quod per "Ne obsignes verba prophetiae hujus, quia tempus prope est," significetur quod Apocalypsis non occlusa erit, sed aperienda, et quod hoc necessum sit in fine Ecclesiae, ut aliqui salventur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;dicit pro "dixit" </p>
