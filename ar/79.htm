<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>79.“也曾试验那自称为使徒却不是的，发现他们是撒谎的人”表他们细察那些在教会中被称为良善与真理，实为邪恶与虚假的事。若不通过灵义，由此知道“使徒”和“撒谎的人”表示什么，就无法看出所表示的是这些事。“使徒”不是指使徒，而是指教导教会的良善与真理的所有人，从抽象意义上说，是指其教义的良善与真理本身。“使徒”不是指使徒，这一点从向他们所说这些话很清楚地看出来：</p><p>当人子坐在祂荣耀的宝座上时，你们也要坐在十二个宝座上审判以色列十二个支派。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.28.htm">19:28</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.30.htm">22:30</a>）</p><p>谁看不出，使徒不会也不能审判任何人，更不能审判以色列十二支派，唯独主照着出于圣言的教会教义的良善与真理进行审判？这一点也可从以下经文清楚看出来：</p><p>新耶路撒冷的城墙有十二根基，根基上有羔羊十二使徒的名字。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.14.htm">21:14</a>）</p><p>因为“新耶路撒冷”表新教会（<a href="880.htm">880</a>，<a href="881.htm">881</a>节），其“十二根基”表其教义的一切良善与真理（<a href="902.htm">902</a>节等）。</p><p>这一点还可从以下经文清楚看出来：</p><p>天哪，你们众圣徒和众先知都要欢喜。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.20.htm">18:20</a>）</p><p>若非“使徒和先知”表示教会所有处于教义的良善和真理的人，使徒和先知的欢喜能表示什么呢？主的“门徒”表示那些在教义的良善与真理上接受主教导的人；而“使徒”表示那些接受教导后再去教导的人，因为经上说：</p><p>耶稣差遣祂的十二门徒去宣传神的国，使徒回来，将所做的事告诉祂。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.1.htm">9:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.10.htm">10</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可6.7.htm">6:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可6.30.htm">30</a>）</p><p>“撒谎的人”表示那些处于虚假的人，抽象而言，是指虚假本身。这一点从圣言中提及“撒谎的人”和“谎言”的诸多经文明显可知，若加引用，恐怕篇幅很长。“谎言”在灵义上也无非是指虚假。由此明显可知，“也曾试验那自称为使徒却不是的，发现他们是撒谎的人”表示他们细察那些在教会中被称为良善与真理，实为邪恶与虚假的事。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 79</h4><p>79. "'And you have explored those who say they are apostles and are not, and have found them liars.'" This symbolically means that they have examined what in the church are called goods and truths, which nevertheless are evils and falsities.<p>That this is the symbolic meaning can be seen only by recourse to the spiritual sense, and only if one knows from that sense what apostles and liars mean. Apostles do not mean apostles, but all who teach the church's goods and truths, and in an abstract sense, its doctrinal goods and truths themselves.<p>That apostles do not mean apostles is clearly apparent from this declaration to them:<p>...when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you... will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. (<a href="3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>; cf. <a href="3927/luke_22_30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>)<p>Who does not see that the apostles would not judge anyone, and cannot judge anyone, much less the twelve tribes of Israel, but that the Lord alone would do so in accordance with the goods and truths of the church's doctrine that it has from the Word?<p>The same is clearly apparent also from the following:<p>The wall of the city (of the New Jerusalem) had twelve foundations, and on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. (<a href="3927/revelation_21_14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>)<p>The same is clearly apparent from this since the New Jerusalem symbolizes the New Church (nos. <a href="880.htm">880</a>, <a href="881.htm">881</a>), and its foundations all the goods and truths of its doctrine (nos. <a href="902.htm">902</a>ff.)</p><p>[2] The same is apparent as well from this:<p>Rejoice..., O heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets... (<a href="3927/revelation_18_20.htm">Revelation 18:20</a>)<p>What is the rejoicing of apostles and prophets, unless apostles and prophets mean all those people who possess doctrinal goods and truths in the church?<p>The Lord's disciples mean people who are instructed by the Lord in doctrinal goods and truths, while apostles mean those who, after having been instructed, teach them. For we are told,<p>(Jesus) sent (His twelve disciples) to preach the kingdom of God..., and when the apostles had returned, they told Him whatever they had done. (<a href="3927/luke_9_1.htm">Luke 9:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/luke_9_10.htm">10</a>; cf. <a href="3927/mark_6_7.htm">Mark 6:7</a>, <a href="3927/mark_6_30.htm">30</a>)<p>Liars mean people who are caught up in falsities, and abstractly the falsities themselves, as can be seen from many passages in the Word where liars and lies are mentioned - so many that if we were to cite them they would fill pages. In the spiritual sense lies are nothing else than falsities.<p>It can be seen from this now that the statement, "You have explored those who say they are apostles and are not, and have found them liars," means, symbolically, that they have examined what in the church are called goods and truths, which nevertheless are evils and falsities. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 79</h4><p>79. 'And hast examined them who say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars' signifies that they scrutinise the things in the Church that are said to be good and true but yet are evil and untrue. That these things are signified can only be seen by means of the spiritual sense, and if it is known therefrom what is understood by 'apostles' and 'liars.' By 'apostles' are not understood apostles, but all who teach the goods and truths of the Church, and in the abstract sense the goods and truths themselves of its Doctrine. That by 'apostles' are not understood apostles is plainly evident from this [saying] to them:<p>When the Son of Man shall sit upon the throne of His glory, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <a href="3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>.<p>Who does not see that the apostles are not going to judge anyone, and that they are not able to do so, least of all the twelve tribes of Israel, but that only the Lord can do this in accordance with the goods and truths of the doctrine of the Church out of the Word? Then again from these [words]:<p>The wall of the city New Jerusalem had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. <a href="3927/revelation_21_14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>, since by 'New Jerusalem' the New Church is signified (<a href="880.htm">880-881</a>), and by its 'foundations' all the goods and truths of its doctrine (<a href="902.htm">902</a> seq.).</p><p>[2] And also from these:<p>Exult, O heaven, and the holy apostles and prophets. <a href="3927/revelation_18_20.htm">Revelation 18:20</a>.<p>What is the exultation of apostles and prophets, unless by them are understood all who are in the goods and truths of the doctrine in the Church? By the Lord's 'disciples' are understood those who are instructed by the Lord in the goods and truths of the doctrine, while by 'apostles' are understood those who after having been instructed teach the same, for it is said:<p>Jesus sent His twelve disciples to preach the kingdom of God, and the apostles, having returned, told Him all that they had done. <a href="3927/luke_9_1.htm">Luke 9:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/luke_9_10.htm">10</a>; <a href="3927/mark_6_7.htm">Mark 6:7</a>, <a href="3927/mark_6_30.htm">30</a>.<p>That by 'liars' are understood those who are in untruths, and abstractly the untruths themselves, can be established from very many places in the Word, where those that lie and lies are mentioned, and if these were cited they would fill pages. 'Lies' in the spiritual sense are nothing but untruths. From these considerations it can now be established that by 'thou hast examined them that say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars' is signified that they scrutinise the things in the Church that are said to be good and true but yet are evil and untrue. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 79</h4><p>79. And has tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars, signifies that they scrutinize those things which are called goods and truths in the church, which nevertheless are evils and falsities. That this is what is signified, cannot be seen except by the spiritual sense, and unless it is thence known what is meant by "apostles" and by "liars": by "apostles" are not meant apostles, but all who teach the goods and truths of the church, and, in the abstract sense, the goods and truths themselves of its doctrine. That apostles are not meant by "apostles," clearly appears from these words addressed to them:<p>When the Son of man shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel, (<a href="3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>).<p>Who does not see that the apostles are not to judge anyone, and cannot, much less the twelve tribes of Israel, but that the Lord alone will do this according to the goods and truths of the doctrine of the church from the Word? In like manner from this passage:<p>The wall of the city New Jerusalem had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>).<p>Because by the "New Jerusalem" is signified the New Church, (<a href="880.htm">880</a>, <a href="881.htm">881</a>), and by its "foundations," all the goods and truths of its doctrine, (<a href="902.htm">902</a>, and following numbers).</p><p>[2] And also from this passage:<p>Exult O heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets, (<a href="3927/revelation_18_20.htm">Revelation 18:20</a>).<p>What can the exultation of the apostles and prophets signify, unless by them are meant all who are in the goods and truths of doctrine in the church? By the Lord's disciples are meant those who are instructed by the Lord in the goods and truths of doctrine; but by apostles they who, after they are instructed, teach them; for it is said:<p>Jesus sent His twelve disciples to preach the kingdom of God, and the apostles, when they were returned, told Him all that they had done, (<a href="3927/luke_9_1.htm">Luke 9:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/luke_9_10.htm">10</a>; <a href="3927/mark_6_7.htm">Mark 6:7</a>, <a href="3927/mark_6_30.htm">30</a>).<p>That by "liars" are meant they who are in falsities, and, abstractly, the falsities themselves, may appear from many places in the Word, where "liars" and "lies" are mentioned, which, if they were adduced, would fill pages; "lies" in the spiritual sense, are nothing else than falsities. From these considerations it may appear, that by "thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars," is signified that they scrutinize those things in the church which are called goods and truths, but which nevertheless are evils and falsities. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 79 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>79. "Et exploraveris dicentes se esse Apostolos, et non sunt, et inveneris eos mendaces," significat quod scrutentur illa quae in Ecclesia dicuntur esse bona et vera, quae tamen sunt mala et falsa. - Quod haec significentur, non videri potest nisi per Sensum spiritualem, et nisi inde sciatur quid intelligitur per "Apostolos" et per "Mendaces;" per "Apostolos" non intelliguntur Apostoli, sed omnes qui docent bona et vera Ecclesiae, et in sensu abstracto ipsa bona et vera Doctrinae ejus. Quod non Apostoli intelligantur per "Apostolos," patet clare ab hoc ad illos: <p>"Quando sedebit Filius Hominis super Throno gloriae Suae, sedebitis etiam vos super duodecim Thronis judicantes duodecim Tribus Israelis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_79/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_19_28" target=_top>Matthaeus 19:28</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_79/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_22_30" target=_top>Luca 22:30</a>);<p>quis non videt, quod Apostoli non aliquem judicaturi sint, et quod nec possint, minus duodecim Tribus Israelis, sed quod solus Dominus secundum bona et vera doctrinae Ecclesiae ex Verbo. Tum etiam ex his: <p>"Murus urbis" Novae Hierosolymae "habebat fundamenta duodecim, et in illis nomina duodecim Apostolorum Agni," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_79/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_14" target=_top>Apocalypsis 21:14</a>);<p>quoniam per "Novam Hierosolymam" significatur Nova Ecclesia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_79/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_880" target=_top>880</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_79/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_881" target=_top>881</a>), et per "fundamenta" ejus omnia bona et vera doctrinae ejus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_79/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_902" target=_top>902</a>. seq.). Et quoque ex his: <p>"Exulta Caelum, ac sancti Apostoli et Prophetae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_79/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_18_20" target=_top>Apocalypsis 18:20</a>);<p>quid exultatio Apostolorum et Prophetarum, nisi per illos intelligantur omnes qui in bonis et veris doctrinae in Ecclesia sunt. Per discipulos Domini intelliguntur qui a Domino instruuntur in bonis et veris doctrinae; at per Apostolos, qui postquam instructi sunt, illa docent, nam dicitur: <p>Jesus emisit duodecim Discipulos Suos praedicare Regnum Dei, et reversi Apostoli narraverunt Ipsi quaecunque fecerunt, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_79/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_9_1-2" target=_top>Luca 9:1-2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_79/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_9_10" target=_top>10</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_79/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_6_7" target=_top>Marcus 6:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_79/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_6_30" target=_top>30</a>).<p>Quod per "Mendaces" intelligantur illi qui in falsis sunt, et abstracte ipsa falsa, constare potest ex permultis locis in Verbo, ubi "Mentientes" et "Mendacia" nominantur, quae si adducerentur implerent paginas; Mendacia in spirituali Sensu nec aliud sunt quam falsa. Ex his nunc constare potest, quod per "Exploraveris dicentes Se esse Apostolos, et non sunt, et inveneris eos mendaces," significetur quod scrutentur illa quae in Ecclesia dicuntur esse bona et Vera, quae tamen sunt mala et falsa. </p>
