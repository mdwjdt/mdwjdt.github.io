<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第742节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>742.启17:13.“他们都有一个心思，将自己的能力权柄给那兽”表他们一致承认对教会的管理和统治唯独通过圣言。“有一个心思”表示一致承认；“将能力权柄给那兽”表示将对教会的管理和统治归给圣言。之所以表示对教会的管理和统治，是因为所论述的主题是圣言，因而是教会。由此明显可知，这些人“都有一个心思，将自己的能力权柄给那兽”表示他们一致承认对教会的管理和统治唯独通过圣言。他们的确承认教皇是教会的头；但声称他对教会的管理和统治，不像头对身体的统领，而像高于身体之物凭神通过圣言，而不是凭它自己统治和管理；在这种情况下要服从圣言。所以，他们承认，圣言的解释权不像既成的事实那样仅属于教皇的特权；因为这样圣言的神性权威就会被败坏并灭亡。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 742</h4><p>742. <a href="3927/revelation_17_13.htm">17:13</a> "These are of one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast." This symbolically means that Roman Catholics in France unanimously acknowledge that the only means of government and dominion over the church is through the Word.<p>To be of one mind means, symbolically, to unanimously acknowledge. To give power and authority to the beast means, symbolically, to assign government and dominion over the church to the Word. Government and dominion over the church are meant since, as the Word is the subject, the reference is to the church.<p>It is apparent from this that the ten kings being of one mind and giving their power and authority to the beast means symbolically that Roman Catholics in France unanimously acknowledge that the only means of government and dominion over the church is through the Word.<p>Roman Catholics in France do indeed acknowledge the Pope as head of the church, but view his government and dominion over the church as being not like that of the head over the body, but like something supreme above the body, which does not govern and rule of itself, but from God by means of the Word, and which is then to be obeyed. Consequently, interpretation of the Word is not the Pope's alone as he may decide, which is the case, because the Word's Divine authority is thus perverted and perishes. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 742</h4><p>742. [verse 13] 'These have one purpose, and shall surrender their power and authority to the beast' signifies that they unanimously acknowledge that government and dominion over the Church is solely by means of the Word. By 'to have one purpose' is signified to acknowledge unanimously. By 'to surrender power and authority to the beast' is signified to attach government and dominion over the Church to the Word. The reason that it is government and dominion over the Church is because it treats of those because it treats of the Word. It is plain from these things that by 'these have one purpose, and shall surrender their power and authority to the beast' is signified that they unanimously acknowledge that government and dominion over the Church is solely by means of the Word. They indeed acknowledge the Pontiff as head of the Church, but they do not acknowledge his government and dominion over the Church as like that of the head over the body, but as what is supreme over the body, which rules and dominates not out of itself but out of God by means of the Word; and that it is in such case to be obeyed. Consequently [they acknowledge] that the interpretation of the Word does not belong to him only of right, as has come to pass, because thus the Divine authority of the Word is perverted and perishes. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 742</h4><p>742. Verse 13. These have one mind, and shall give over their power and authority to the beast, signifies that they acknowledge unanimously that government and dominion over the church are solely through the Word. By "having one mind" is signified to acknowledge unanimously; by "giving power and authority to the beast" is signified to ascribe government and dominion over the church to the Word. The reason that government and dominion over the church are meant, is because the Word, and therefore the church, is treated of. From these things it is manifest, that by "these have one mind, and give their power and authority to the beast," is signified that they unanimously acknowledge that government and dominion over the church are solely through the Word. They indeed acknowledge the Pontiff as the head of the church; but they say that his government and dominion over the church is not like that of the head over the body, but is like one supreme over the body that does not rule and govern from itself, but from God through the Word; and that it is then to be obeyed. Consequently that the interpretation of the Word does not belong to his arbitrary determination alone, as has come to pass; because thus the Divine authority of the Word is perverted and perishes. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 742 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>742. (Vers. 13.) "Hi unam sententiam habent, at potentiam et potestatem suam Bestiae tradent," significat quod illi unanimiter agnoscant, quod regimen et dominium super Ecclesiam unice sit per Verbum. -Per "unam sententiam habere" significatur unanimiter agnoscere; per "potentiam et potestatem Bestiae tradere" significatur regimen et dominium super Ecclesiam addicare Verbo; quod sit regimen et dominium super Ecclesiam, est quoniam de illa, quia de Verbo, agitur. Ex his patet, quod per "hi unam sententiam habent, et potentiam et potestatem suam Bestiae tradent," significetur quod illi unanimiter agnoscant quod regimen et dominium super Ecclesiam unice sit per Verbum. Agnoscunt quidem Pontificem ut Caput Ecclesiae, sed regimen et dominiun ejus super Ecclesiam non sicut est Capitis super Corpus, sed sicut est Supremum supra Corpus, quod non regit et dominatur ex se, sed ex Deo per Verbum, et quod tunc obediendum sit: consequenter quod interpretatio Verbi non sit illi soli ex arbitrio, ut fit, quia sic pervertitur et perit Divina auctoritas Verbi. </p>
