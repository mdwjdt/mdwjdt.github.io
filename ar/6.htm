<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>6.“他便将神的道和耶稣基督的见证都证明出来”表凡发自内心、因而在光中接受来自主的神性真理并承认主的人性就是神性的人。经上论到约翰说，“他将神的道证明出来”，但由于“约翰”是指所有处于源自仁及其信的生活良善之人，如前所述（<a href="5.htm">5</a>节），故在灵义上所指的是所有这些人。处于圣言灵义的天使，从来不知道圣言所提到的任何人名，只知道这个人所代表并因此所表示的，并且取代“约翰”的，是生活的良善或行为上的良善；进而是总体上所有处于这良善的人。正是这些人“证明出来”，也就是看见，承认，发自内心在光中接受并宣称圣言的真理，尤其是主的人性就是神性这一真理，这一点从《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》可以得到证实。启示录中的“耶稣基督”及“羔羊”是指主的神性人（Divine Human）；“神”指主的神性，万物皆来自这神性。</p><p>至于“证明出来”的灵义，它论及真理，因为在世间，要见证的正是真理，见证以后真理才得到承认。然而，在天堂，真理自己就能自我见证，因为真理是天堂之光本身。天使一听闻真理，当即就知道并承认它。由于主是真理本身，正如祂自己在约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>）所教导的，故在天堂，祂就是祂自己的见证。由此明显可知“耶稣基督的见证”是什么意思。因此，主说：</p><p>你们曾差人到约翰那里，他为真理作过见证。但我不接受从人而来的见证。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.33.htm">5:33</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.34.htm">34</a>）</p><p></p><p>约翰来，为要作见证，就是为光作见证；他不是那光；，叫众人因他可以信。道与神同在，道就是神，道成了肉身，是真光，照亮所有的人。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.7.htm">7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.34.htm">34</a>）</p><p></p><p>耶稣说，我虽然为自己作见证，我的见证还是真的。因我知道我从哪里来，往哪里去。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.14.htm">8:14</a>）</p><p>当保惠师，就是真理的灵来到后，祂就要为我作见证。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.26.htm">15:26</a>）</p><p>“保惠师，就是真理的灵”是指从主所发出的真理本身，对此，经上说“祂不是凭自己说”，而是凭主说的（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.13.htm">16:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.15.htm">15</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 6</h4><p>6. Who bore witness to the Word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ. (<a href="3927/revelation_1_2.htm">1:2</a>) This symbolically means, who from the heart and so in a state of light receive Divine truth from the Word and acknowledge the Lord's humanity to be Divine.<p>John is said to have borne witness to the Word of God, but because John means all people who possess goodness of life arising from charity and its accompanying faith, as said just above in no. <a href="5.htm">5</a>, therefore all these are meant in the spiritual sense. The angels, who are concerned with the spiritual sense of the Word, never know the name of any person mentioned in the Word, but only what the person represents and so symbolizes, which in the case of John is goodness of life or goodness in act, and consequently all people as a whole who possess that goodness. These bear witness, which is to say, they see, acknowledge, and accept from the heart in a state of light, and confess the truths of the Word, especially this truth there, that the Lord's humanity is Divine, as can be seen from the copious passages cited from the Word in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord.<p>Jesus Christ and the Lamb in the book of Revelation mean the Lord in respect to His Divine humanity, and God means the Lord in respect to the Divine itself from which springs all else.</p><p>[2] As regards the spiritual signification of bearing witness, this is said of truth, because in the world it is truth to which one is to bear witness, and which, when borne witness to, is acknowledged. But in heaven truth bears witness to itself, because it is the very light of heaven. For when angels hear the truth, they at once recognize it and acknowledge it. And because the Lord is the embodiment of truth, as He Himself teaches in <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>, <sup>1</sup>He is, in heaven, self-witnessing. This makes apparent what is meant by the testimony of Jesus Christ. Therefore the Lord says,<p>You have sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth. Yet I do not receive testimony from man... (<a href="3927/john_5_33.htm">John 5:33-34</a>)<p>And in another place:<p>(John) came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light... He was not that Light... (The Word that was with God and was God, and became flesh,) was the true Light which gives light to every man... (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_7.htm">7-9</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_34.htm">34</a>)<p>Elsewhere:<p>Jesus... said..., ."..I bear witness of Myself, (and) My witness is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going... (<a href="3927/john_8_14.htm">John 8:14</a>)<p>When the Counselor comes..., the Spirit of truth..., it will testify of Me. (<a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>)<p>The Counselor, the spirit of truth, means the truth itself emanating from the Lord. Therefore it is said concerning it that it will not speak of itself but from the Lord (<a href="3927/john_16_13.htm">John 16:13-15</a>). <sup>2</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me."<br><br>2.&nbsp;[Jesus said,] "However, when it, the Spirit of truth, has come, it will guide you into all truth; for it will not speak on its own authority, but whatever it hears it will speak; and it will tell you things to come. It will glorify Me, for it will take of what is Mine and declare it to you. All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that it will take of Mine and declare it to you." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 6</h4><p>6. [verse 2] 'Who bare witness of the Word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ' signifies who from the heart, and so in the light, receive Divine Truth out of the Word, and acknowledge the Lord's Human to be Divine. It is said of John that he bare witness of the Word of God; but since by 'John' is understood all who are in the good of a life derived from charity and its faith, as has been stated just above (<a href="5.htm">5</a>), therefore all those are understood in the spiritual sense. The angels, who are in the spiritual sense of the Word, never know any name of a person mentioned by name in the Word, but only what the person represents and thence signifies, and this, instead of 'John,' is the good of life, or good in act; consequently all comprehensively who are in that good. These 'bear witness' that is, see, acknowledge, receive from the heart in the light, and avow, the truths of the Word, especially that truth there that the Lord's Human is Divine, as can be established from the passages out of the Word adduced in abundance in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD. By 'Jesus Christ' and by 'the Lamb' in the Apocalypse is understood the Lord as to the Divine Human, and by 'God' the Lord as to the Divine from which [all things are] (Divinum a Quo).</p><p>[2] With regard to the spiritual signification of 'to bear witness,' this is predicated of the truth (veritas), because in the world the truth (veritas) is to be witnessed, and when it has been witnessed, it is acknowledged. In heaven, however, the truth (veritas) itself bears witness of itself, because it is the very light of heaven. For when angels hear a truth (veritas) they recognise and acknowledge it there and then; and since the Lord is the Truth (Veritas) Itself as He Himself teaches in <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>, in heaven He is His own Testimony. From this it is plain what is understood by 'the testimony of Jesus Christ.' Therefore the Lord says:<p>You sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth (veritas), but<p>I receive not testimony from man. <a href="3927/john_5_33.htm">John 5:33-34</a>.<p>And in another place:<p>John came for a testimony to bear witness of the Light; he was not that Light: the Word, which was with God and was God, and was made flesh, was the true Light, which lights every man. <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_7.htm">7-8</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_34.htm">34</a>.<p>Elsewhere:<p>Jesus said, I bear witness of Myself, and My testimony is true, for I know whence I came and whither I go. <a href="3927/john_8_14.htm">John 8:14</a>.<p>When the Comforter the Spirit of truth (veritas) has come, He shall testify of Me. <a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>.<p>By 'the Comforter the Spirit of truth' is understood the Truth (Veritas) itself proceeding from the Lord, concerning which it is therefore said that He will not speak from Himself but out of the Lord (<a href="3927/john_16_13.htm">John 16:13-15</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 6</h4><p>6. Verse 2. Who testified the Word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, signifies who, from the heart, and thus in the light, receive the Divine truth from the Word, and acknowledge the Lord's Human to be Divine. It is said of John that "he testified the Word of God," but as by John are meant all who are in the good of life from charity and its faith, as was said above, (<a href="5.htm">5</a>), therefore in the spiritual sense all these are meant. The angels, who are in the spiritual sense of the Word, never know any name of a person mentioned in the Word, but only that which the person represents and thence signifies, which, instead of John, is the good of life, or good in act; consequently all in the aggregate who are in that good. These "testify," that is, see, acknowledge, receive from the heart in the light, and confess the truths of the Word, especially that truth therein that the Lord's Human is Divine; which may be evident from the passages quoted from the Word in great abundance in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord. By "Jesus Christ" and by "the Lamb" in the Apocalypse is meant the Lord as to the Divine Human, and by "God," the Lord as to His Divine, from which are all things.</p><p>[2] With regard to the spiritual signification of "testifying," this is predicated of truth, because in the world the truth is to be testified, and when it is testified, it is acknowledged. But in heaven truth testifies of itself because it is itself the light of heaven. For when the angels hear the truth, they immediately know and acknowledge it; and because the Lord is the truth itself, as He Himself teaches in <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>, He is in heaven the testimony of Himself. Hence it may appear what is meant by "the testimony of Jesus Christ;" wherefore the Lord says:<p>Ye sent unto John, and he testified unto the truth; but I receive not testimony from man, (<a href="3927/john_5_33.htm">John 5:33-34</a>).<p>And in another place:<p>John came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light; he was not that Light; the Word which was with God, and was God, and became flesh, was the true Light, which lighteth every man, (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_7.htm">7-8</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_34.htm">34</a>).<p>And in another place:<p>Jesus said, Though I testify of Myself, yet My testimony is true, for I know whence I came, and whither I go, (<a href="3927/john_8_14.htm">John 8:14</a>.<p>When the Comforter has come, even the Spirit of truth, He shall testify of Me, (<a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>).<p>By the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, is meant the truth itself proceeding from the Lord, wherefore it is said of it that it will not speak from itself, but from the Lord, (<a href="3927/john_16_13.htm">John 16:13-15</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 6 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>6. (Vers. 2.) "Qui testatus est verbum Dei, et testimonium Jesu Christi," significat qui ex corde, et sic in luce, recipiunt Divinum verum ex Verbo, et agnoscunt Humanum Domini Divinum esse. -Dicitur de Johanne, quod ille "testatus sit Verbum Dei;" sed quia per Johannem intelliguntur omnes qui in bono vitae ex charitate et ejus fide sunt, ut mox supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_5" target=_top>5</a>) dictum est, ideo in sensu Spirituali omnes illi intelliguntur. Angeli, qui in sensu Spirituali Verbi sunt, nusquam sciunt aliquod nomen personae in Verbo nominatum, sed solum id quod persona repraesentat et inde significat, quod pro Johanne est bonum vitae, seu bonum actu; consequenter omnes in complexu qui in illo bono sunt; hi "testantur," hoc est, vident, agnoscunt, recipiunt ex corde in luce, et confitentur vera Verbi, imprimis illud verum ibi quod Humanum Domini sit Divinum, ut constare potest ex locis e Verbo in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino, in copia allatis. Per "Jesum Christum" et per "Agnum" in Apocalypsi intelligitur Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum; et per "Deum," Dominus quoad Ipsum Divinum a Quo. Quod significationem spiritualem "testari" attinet, praedicatur id de Veritate, ex causa quia in mundo veritas testanda est, et cum testata est, agnoscitur; at in Caelo ipsa veritas de se testatur, quia est ipsa Lux Caeli; dum enim Angeli audiunt veritatem, illico cognoscunt illam et agnoscunt; et quia Dominus est ipsa Veritas, ut Ipse docet apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_6" target=_top>Johannem 14:6</a>, est Ipse in Caelo Testimonium Sui; inde patet quid per "Testimonium Jesu Christi" intelligitur quare dicit Dominus, <p>"Vos misistis ad Johannem, et testis fuit veritati; Ego tamen non ab homine testimonium accipio," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_5_33-34" target=_top>Johannes 5:33-34</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>et alibi: <p>Johannes venit in Testimonium ut testaretur de Luce; non erat ille Lux: Verbum, quod erat apud Deum et erat Deus, et Caro factum est, erat Lux vera, quae illuminat omnem hominem, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_1-2" target=_top>Johannes 1:1-2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_7-8" target=_top>7-8</a>, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_9" target=_top>9</a>,) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_14" target=_top>14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_34" target=_top>34</a>);<p>alibi: <p>"Jesus dixit, Ego testor de Me Ipso, et verum est Testimonium Meum, quia scio unde veni et quo vado," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_8_14" target=_top>Johannes 8:14</a>);<p>"Cum venerit Paracletus Spiritus veritatis, ille testabitur de Me," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_26" target=_top>Johannes 15:26</a>);<p>per Paracletum Spiritum veritatis intelligitur ipsa Veritas procedens a Domino; quare de illo dicitur, quod non locuturus sit a se sed ex Domino, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_16_13-14" target=_top>Johannes 16:13-14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_16_15" target=_top>15</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;33, 34 pro "13" </p>
