<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>245.“四活物周围各有六个翅膀”表圣言的能力和守护。“四活物”表示圣言，如前所示；“翅膀”表示能力，以及守护，这一点可参看下文。“六”表示真理与良善上的全部，因为六是“三”乘“二”，而“三”表示真理上的全部（<a href="505.htm">505</a>节），“二”则表示良善上的全部（<a href="762.htm">762</a>节）。“翅膀”表示能力，因为鸟儿凭翅膀上腾，鸟的翅膀犹如人的膀臂，而“膀臂”就表示能力。由于“翅膀”表示能力，四活物又各有六个翅膀，故从前面的解释明显可知各活物的翅膀表示哪种能力了，也就是说，“狮子的翅膀”表示与地狱的邪恶并虚假争战的能力，这种能力属于来自主的圣言神性真理。“牛犊的翅膀”表示感染心灵的能力，因为圣言的神性真理感染那些以神圣方式阅读圣言的人。“人的六个翅膀”表示在神的本质及其属性上变得智慧的能力，因为这种能力正是阅读圣言之人的。“鹰的翅膀”表示认识真理与良善，并由此为自己获得聪明的能力。</p><p>论到基路伯的翅膀，我们在以西结书上读到：</p><p>翅膀彼此相对，还遮体，翅膀以下有手的样式。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.23.htm">1:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.24.htm">24</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.13.htm">3:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结10.5.htm">10:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结10.21.htm">21</a>）</p><p>“彼此相对”表示联合一致的行动；“遮体”表示守护，以免属于圣言灵义的内在真理遭到亵渎；“翅膀以下的手”表示能力。论到“撒拉弗”，经上还说：</p><p>它们有六个翅膀；用两个翅膀遮脸，两个翅膀遮脚，两个翅膀飞翔。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.2.htm">6:2</a>）</p><p>“撒拉弗”同样表示圣言，严格来说，表示取自圣言的教义；“用两个翅膀遮脸，两个翅膀遮脚”同样表示守护；“两个翅膀飞翔”同样表示能力，和前面一样。 “飞翔”表示觉知和教导，在至高意义上表示主的看顾和供应。这一点也可从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>神骑着基路伯飞行，藉着风的翅膀快飞。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.10.htm">18:10</a>；撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下22.11.htm">22:11</a>）</p><p>我又看见另一位天使飞在空中，有永远的福音。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.6.htm">14:6</a>）</p><p>“翅膀”表示守护，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>耶和华必用自己的翅膀遮蔽你。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗91.4.htm">91:4</a>）</p><p>求你将我隐藏在神翅膀的荫下。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗17.8.htm">17:8</a>）</p><p>世人投靠在祂翅膀的荫下。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗36.7.htm">36:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗57.1.htm">57:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗63.7.htm">63:7</a>）</p><p>我展翅掩覆你，遮盖你的赤体。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.8.htm">16:8</a>）</p><p>你们必因祂的翅膀得医治。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛4.2.htm">4:2</a>）</p><p>又如鹰搅动巢窝，在雏鹰以上两翅扇展，接取雏鹰，背在两翼之上。这样，耶和华独自引导他。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.11.htm">32:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>耶稣说，耶路撒冷啊，我多次愿意聚集你的儿女，好像母鸡把小鸡聚集在翅膀底下。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.37.htm">23:37</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.34.htm">13:34</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 245</h4><p>245. The four living creatures, each individually having six wings about it. (<a href="3927/revelation_4_8.htm">4:8</a>) This symbolizes the Word in respect to its powers and protections.<p>We have already shown above that the four living creatures symbolize the Word. We will see below that wings symbolize powers and also protections.<p>The number six symbolizes completeness in respect to truth and goodness, as six is formed of three and two multiplied together, and three symbolizes completeness in respect to truth (no. <a href="505.htm">505</a>), while two symbolizes completeness in respect to goodness (no. <a href="762.htm">762</a>).<p>Wings symbolize powers because they are means of rising upward. Moreover, in the case of birds they take the place of the arms in the human being, and arms symbolize powers.<p>Since wings symbolize powers, and each living creature had six wings, it is apparent from what we said above what power is symbolized by each one's wings, namely, that the wings of the lion symbolize the power of combating the evils and falsities arising from hell, this being the power of the Word's Divine truth from the Lord; that the wings of the calf symbolize the power to affect hearts, for the Divine truth of the Word affects people who read it reverently; that the six wings of the human being symbolize the power to perceive the nature of God and what pertains to God, as this is peculiarly the mark of a human being in reading the Word; and that the wings of the eagle symbolize the power to recognize truth and good, and so to acquire for oneself intelligence.</p><p>[2] As regards the wings of cherubim, we read in Ezekiel that their wings kissed each other, that they had wings also covering their bodies, and that they had the likeness of hands under their wings (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_23.htm">Ezekiel 1:23-24</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_13.htm">3:13</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_5.htm">10:5</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_21.htm">21</a>). Kissing each other symbolizes conjoint and unanimous action. Covering their bodies symbolizes protection against violation of the interior truths which constitute the spiritual sense of the Word. And having the likeness of hands under their wings symbolizes powers.<p>Regarding seraphim, too, we are told that they had six wings, and that with two of them they covered their face, and with two their feet, and with two they flew (<a href="3927/isaiah_6_2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>). Seraphim likewise symbolize the Word, or more accurately doctrine drawn from the Word. The wings with which they covered their faces and feet likewise symbolize protections. And the wings with which they flew symbolize powers, as before.<p>That flying symbolizes to perceive and teach, and in the highest sense to foresee and provide, is clear as well from the following:<p>(God) rode upon a cherub, He flew, and He traveled on the wings of the wind. (<a href="3927/psalms_18_10.htm">Psalms 18:10</a>, cf. <a href="3927/2-samuel_22_11.htm">2 Samuel 22:11</a>)<p>I saw (an) angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel... (<a href="3927/revelation_14_6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>)</p><p>[3] That wings symbolize protections is apparent from the following:<p>(Jehovah) covers you under His wing. (<a href="3927/psalms_91_4.htm">Psalms 91:4</a>)<p>(To be hidden) under the shadow of (God's) wings... (<a href="3927/psalms_17_8.htm">Psalms 17:8</a>)<p>(To trust) in the shadow of (His) wings.

(<a href="3927/malachi_4_2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>)<p>As an eagle stirs up its nest, hovers over its young, spreading out its wings..., carrying them on its wings, so Jehovah... leads him... (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11-12</a>)<p>(Jesus said,) "O Jerusalem...! How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings...

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 245</h4><p>245. [verse 8] 'And the four animals, each separately, had six wings round about' signifies the Word as to power and as to its guards. That by 'the four animals' the Word is signified, has been shown above; that by 'wings 'are signified powers, and also guards, will be seen below. By 'six' is signified all as to truth and good, for six comes into existence out of 3, 2 multiplied together, and by 'three' is signified all as to truths (<a href="505.htm">505</a>), and by 'two' all as to good (<a href="762.htm">762</a>). Powers are signified by the 'wings,' because by means of them [birds] raise themselves upwards, and wings with birds are in place of arms with a man, and by 'arms' powers are signified. Since powers are signified by the 'wings,' and each animal had six wings, it is plain from the things said above what kind of power is signified by the 'wings' of each, namely, that by the 'wings of a lion' is signified the power of fighting against evils and untruths out of hell. This is the power of the Divine Truth of the Word from the Lord. [It is plain also] that by the 'wings of a calf' is signified the power of affecting the mind (animus), for the Divine Truth of the Word affects those who read it in a holy manner (sancte); that by the 'six wings of a man' is signified the power of discerning what God is, and what is of God, for this is properly man's in reading the Word, and that by the 'wings of an eagle' is signified the power of recognising what is true and good, and thus of furnishing oneself with intelligence.</p><p>[2] Concerning the wings of the cherubs [we] read in Ezekiel that:<p>The wings were kissing each other, and were also covering their bodies, and the likeness of hands was under them. <a href="3927/ezekiel_1_23.htm">1:23-24</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_13.htm">3:13</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_5.htm">10:5</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_21.htm">21</a>.<p>By 'kissing each other' is signified conjoint and unanimous action; by 'covering the bodies' is signified guarding lest the interior truths that are of the spiritual sense of the Word should be violated; and by 'hands under the wings' are signified powers. Concerning the 'seraphs' it is also said that:<p>They had six wings, with two of which they were covering the face, with two the feet, and with two they were flying. <a href="3927/isaiah_6_2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>.<p>By 'seraphs' in like manner is signified the Word, properly doctrine out of the Word, and by the 'wings with which they were covering faces and feet' guards likewise are signified, and by the 'wings with which they were flying' powers, as above. That by 'flying' is signified to perceive and instruct, and in the highest sense to look out and provide, is established also from these passages:<p>God rode upon a cherub, He did fly, He sailed upon the wings of the wind. <a href="3927/psalms_18_10.htm">Psalms 18:10</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_18_11.htm">11</a>]; <a href="3927/2-samuel_22_11.htm">2 Samuel 22:11</a>.<p>I saw an angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel. <a href="3927/revelation_14_6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>.<p>That guards are signified by 'wings' is plain from these passages:<p>Jehovah shall cover thee under His wing. <a href="3927/psalms_91_4.htm">Psalms 91:4</a>.<p>To be hid under the shadow of God's wings. <a href="3927/psalms_17_8.htm">Psalms 17:8</a>.<p>To put trust in the shadow of His wings. <a href="3927/psalms_36_7.htm">Psalms 36:7</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_36_8.htm">8</a>]; <a href="3927/psalms_57_1.htm">57:1</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_57_2.htm">2</a>]; <a href="3927/psalms_63_7.htm">63:7</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_63_8.htm">8</a>].<p>I stretched out a wing over thee, and covered thy nakedness. <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>.<p>Unto you shall be healing in His wings. <a href="3927/malachi_4_2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a> [H.B. 3:20].<p>As an eagle stirs up her nest, flutters over her young, spreads abroad her wings, bears them on her wings, so Jehovah leads him. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10-12</a>.<p>Jesus said:<p>O Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen [gathers] her chickens under her wings. <a href="3927/matthew_23_37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="3927/luke_13_34.htm">Luke 13:34</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 245</h4><p>245. Verse 8. And the four animals each by himself had six wings about him, signifies the Word as to its powers and as to its guards. That by "the four animals" the Word is signified, was shown above; that by wings are signified powers, and also guards, will be seen below. By "six" is signified all as to truth and good, for six is composed of "three" and "two" multiplied together, and by "three" is signified all as to truth, (<a href="505.htm">505</a>), and by "two" all as to good, (<a href="762.htm">762</a>). By "wings" are signified powers, because by them birds lift themselves up, and wings with birds are in the place of arms with men, and by "arms" are signified powers. Since by "wings" are signified powers, and each animal had six wings, it is evident, from what has been said above, what kind of power is signified by the wings of each, namely, that by "the wings of the lion" is signified the power of fighting against evils and falsities from hell; which power is of the Divine truth of the Word from the Lord. That by "the wings of the calf" is signified the power of affecting minds, for the Divine truth of the Word affects those who read it as holy. That by "the six wings of the man" is signified the power of being wise as to what God is, and what is of God, for this is properly man's in reading the Word: and that by "the wings of the eagle" is signified the power of knowing truth and good, and thereby acquiring intelligence for oneself.</p><p>[2] Concerning the wings of the cherubim we read in Ezekiel that:<p>The wings kissed each other, and that they also covered their bodies, and that under them there was the likeness of hands, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_23.htm">Ezekiel 1:23-24</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_13.htm">3:13</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_5.htm">10:5</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_21.htm">21</a>).<p>By "kissing each other," is signified to act in conjunction and unanimously; by "covering their bodies," is signified to guard lest the interior truths which belong to the spiritual sense of the Word be violated; and by "the hands under the wings" are signified powers. Concerning "the seraphim," it is also said, that:<p>They had six wings; with two of which they covered the face, and with two the feet, and with two they flew, (<a href="3927/isaiah_6_2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>).<p>By "seraphim" in like manner is signified the Word, properly doctrine from the Word, and by "the wings with which they covered the faces and feet," in like manner are signified guards, and by "the wings with which they flew," powers, as above. That by "flying" is signified to perceive and instruct, and in the highest sense to look out for and provide, is also evident from these passages:<p>God rode upon a cherub, He did fly, and was carried upon the wings of the wind, (<a href="3927/psalms_18_10.htm">Psalms 18:10</a>; <a href="3927/2-samuel_22_11.htm">2 Samuel 22:11</a>).<p>I saw an angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel, (<a href="3927/revelation_14_6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>).</p><p>[3] That by wings are signified guards, is plain from the following passages:<p>Jehovah shall cover thee under His wings, (<a href="3927/psalms_91_4.htm">Psalms 91:4</a>).<p>To be hid under the shadow of God's wings, (<a href="3927/psalms_17_8.htm">Psalms 17:8</a>).<p>To confide in the shadow of His wings, (<a href="3927/psalms_36_7.htm">Psalms 36:7</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_57_1.htm">57:1</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_63_7.htm">63:7</a>).<p>I stretched out a wing over thee, and covered thy nakedness, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_16_8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>).<p>Unto you shall be healing in His wings, (<a href="3927/malachi_4_2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>).<p>As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, beareth them on her wings, so Jehovah leadeth him, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11-12</a>).<p>Jesus said, O Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, (<a href="3927/matthew_23_37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="3927/luke_13_34.htm">Luke 13:34</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 245 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>245. (Vers. 8.) "Et quatuor Animalia, singula se habebant alas sex in circuitu," significat Verbum quoad potentias et quoad custodias ejus. - Quod potentias "quatuor Animalia" significetur Verbum, supra ostensum est; quod per alas significentur potentiae, et quoque custodiae, infra videbitur: per "sex" significatur omne quoad verum et bonum, sex enim existunt ex "3', et "2" in se multiplicatis, et per "tria" significatur omne quoad verum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_505" target=_top>505</a>), ac per "duo" omne quoad bonum, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_11" target=_top>11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_762" target=_top>762</a>). Per "alas" significantur potentiae, quia per illas se elevant sursum, et alae apud aves sunt loco brachiorum apud hominem, et per "brachia" significantur potentiae. Quoniam per "alas" significantur potentiae, et cuivis Animali erant sex alae, ex supra dictis patet quae potentia significatur per alas cujusvis, nempe, quod per "alas Leonis" significetur potentia pugnandi contra mala et falsa ex Inferno; haec potentia est Divini Veri Verbi a Domino: quod per "alas Vituli" significetur potentia afficiendi animos, nam Divinum Verum Verbi afficit illos qui id sancte legunt: quod per sex "alas Hominis" significetur potentia sapiendi quid Deus et quid Dei, nam haec est proprie hominis in legendo Verbum: et quod per "alas Aquilae" significetur potentia cognoscendi verum et bonum, et sic comparandi sibi intelligentiam. De "Alis Cheruborum" legitur apud Ezechielem quod Alae oscularentur se invicem, et quod etiam tegerent corpora illorum, et quod similitudo manuum esset sub illis, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_1_23-24" target=_top>1:23-24</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_3_13" target=_top>3:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_10_5" target=_top>10:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_10_21" target=_top>21</a>); per "osculari se invicem" significatur conjunctim et unanimiter agere; per "tegere corpora" significatur custodire ne interiora vera, quae sunt Sensus spiritualis Verbi, violentur; et per "manus sub alis" significantur potentiae. De "Seraphim" etiam dicitur, quod illis essent Sex Alae, quarum duabus tegebant faciem, duabus pedes, et duabus volabant, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_6_2" target=_top>Esaias 6:2</a>);<p>per "Seraphim" similiter significatur Verbum, proprie doctrina e Verbo; et per "alas quibus tegebant facies et pedes," similiter significantur custodiae; ac per "alas quibus volabant," potentiae, ut supra: quod per "volare" significetur percipere et instruere, et in supremo Sensu prospicere et providere, constat etiam ex his: <p>"Deus equitavit super Cherubo, Volavit, et vectus est super alis venti," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_18_11" target=_top>Psalm 18:11</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_18_10" target=_top>10</a>); <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-samuel_22_11" target=_top>2 Samuelis 22:11</a>);<p>"Vidi Angelum Volantem per medium Caeli, habentem Evangelium aeternum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_14_6" target=_top>Apocalypsis 14:6</a>).<p>Quod per "Alas" significentur custodiae, patet ex his: <p>Jehovah sub Ala Sua obtegit te," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_91_4" target=_top>Psalm 91:4</a>);<p>"Occultari sub umbra Alarum Dei," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_17_8" target=_top>Psalm 17:8</a>);<p>"Confidere in umbra Alarum Ipsius," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_36_8" target=_top>Psalm 36:8</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_36_7" target=_top>7</a>)); <sup>1</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_57_2" target=_top>Psalm 57:2</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_57_1" target=_top>1</a>); <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_63_8" target=_top>Psalm 63:8</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_63_7" target=_top>7</a>);<p>"Expandi Alam super te, et operui nuditatem tuam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_16_8" target=_top>Ezechiel 16:8</a>);<p>"Erit vobis sanitas in Alis Ipsius," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_malachi_3_1-18" target=_top>Malachias 3</a>:20 (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_malachi_4_2" target=_top>4:2</a>));<p>"Sicut aquila excitat nidum suum, super pullis suis motitat se, expandit Alas suas, portat Alis solis, sic Jehovah ducit eum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_32_11-12" target=_top>Deuteronomius 32:11-12</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>Jesus dixit, "Hierusalem, quoties volui congregare liberos tuos, quem admodum gallina pullos suos sub Alas suas," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_23_37" target=_top>Matthaeus 23:37</a>; Lucas, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_13_1-35" target=_top>13</a>) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_245/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_13_34" target=_top>13:34</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;xxxvi. pro "xxvi."<p>2.&nbsp;11, 12 pro "10, 11, 12" </p>
