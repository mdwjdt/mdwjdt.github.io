<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第13节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>13.“就是来自那昔在、今在、以后永在的”表来自主，主是永恒和无限，是耶和华。这是指主，这一点从本章接下来的经文很明显地看出来，在那里经上说约翰听到人子的声音，说：</p><p>我是阿拉法，是俄梅戛，是首先的，是末后的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.11.htm">1:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>然后说：</p><p>我是首先的，是末后的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.17.htm">1:17</a>）</p><p>还有接下来的经文（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.8.htm">1:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.12.htm">22:12</a>），以赛亚书：</p><p>耶和华以色列的王，以色列的救赎主，万军之耶和华如此说：我是首先的，我是末后的，除我以外再没有真神！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.6.htm">44:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.12.htm">48:12</a>）</p><p>那首先的和末后的，就是那昔在、今在、以后永在的。</p><p>“耶和华”所指相同，因为耶和华之名表今在。那今在者，或为存在本身者，就是昔在和以后永在者，因为过去、未来在祂里面皆为当下。正因如此，祂没有时间，是永恒的，没有空间，是无限的。教会因名为《亚他那修信经》的三位一体教义也承认这一点，其中有这些话：父永恒，子永恒，圣灵亦永恒；父无限，子无限，圣灵亦无限。然而，非三永恒者，乃一永恒者；非三无限者，乃一无限者。这一位就是主，这一点在《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》一书已有论证。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 13</h4><p>13. From Him who is and who was and who is to come. This symbolically means, from the Lord who is eternal and infinite, and who is Jehovah.<p>That it is the Lord is clearly apparent from verses that follow in this chapter, where it is said that John heard a voice from the Son of Man saying, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last," and afterward, "I am the First and the Last" as well as in the next chapter, <a href="3927/revelation_2_8.htm">2:8</a>, and later in <a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">22:12-13</a>). Also in Isaiah:<p>Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Jehovah of Hosts: "I am the First and I am the Last, and besides Me there is no God." (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>; also <a href="3927/isaiah_48_12.htm">48:12</a>)<p>Moreover, He who is the First and the Last is He who is, who was, and who is to come.</p><p>[2] This also is the meaning of "Jehovah." For the name "Jehovah" means "He is" and "He who is," or He who is being itself. <sup>1</sup>It also means "He was" and "He is to come," since the past and the future in Him are present. Consequently He is eternal independently of time, and infinite independently of place.<p>The church also confesses this in conformity with the doctrine of the trinity called the Athanasian Creed, where these words are found:<p>The Father is eternal and infinite, the Son is eternal and infinite, and the Holy Spirit is eternal and infinite. And yet there are not three eternal and infinite Gods, but one.<p>That one is the Lord, as we demonstrated in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;See <a href="3927/exodus_3_13.htm">Exodus 3:13-15</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 13</h4><p>13. 'From Him Who is and Who was and Who is to come' signifies from the Lord Who is the Eternal and Infinite, and is Jehovah. That it is the Lord is quite plain from the things following in this chapter, where it is stated that he heard a voice coming from the SON OF MAN saying:<p>I am Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last (verse 11, 13); and then:<p>I am the First and the Last (verse 17); and in the following chapter (verse 8) and afterwards (chapters <a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">22:12-13</a>); and in Isaiah:<p>Thus says Jehovah the King of Israel, and His Redeemer Jehovah Zebaoth; I am the First and I am the Last, and besides me there is no God. <a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">44:6</a>; also. <a href="3927/isaiah_48_12.htm">48:12</a>; and He Who is the First and the Last is 'He Who is and Who was and Who is to come.</p><p>[2] This also is understood by 'Jehovah'; for the name Jehovah signifies 'is'; and He Who Is, or Who is Being (Esse) Itself, is also WAS, and IS TO COME, for the past and the future are in Him the present. In consequence of this He is the Eternal apart from time, and the Infinite apart from space. The Church avows this because of the DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY that is called Athanasian, where these [words are]:<p>The Father is Eternal and Infinite, the Son is Eternal and Infinite, and the Holy Spirit is Eternal and Infinite, and yet there are not three Eternals and Infinites, but One.<p>That this One is the Lord has been demonstrated in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 13</h4><p>13. From Him who is, who was, and is to come, signifies, from the Lord who is eternal and infinite, and Jehovah. That it is the Lord, appears clearly from what follows in this chapter, where it is said that he heard a voice from the Son of man, saying:<p>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, (<a href="3927/revelation_1_11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_1_13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>);<p>and afterwards:<p>I am the First and the Last, (<a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>);<p>and in the following chapter, (<a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>); and afterwards, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_13.htm">22:13</a>); and in Isaiah:<p>Thus saith Jehovah, the King of Israel, and His Redeemer Jehovah of Hosts: I am the First, and I am the Last, and besides Me there Is no God, (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_48_12.htm">48:12</a>); and He who is the First and the Last, is He who is, and who was, and who is to come.</p><p>[2] This also is meant by Jehovah; for the name Jehovah signifies is; and He who is, or who is Esse itself, the same is also He who was, and is to come, for in Him the past and the future are present; hence He is without time eternal, and without place infinite. This also is acknowledged by the church in the Doctrine of the Trinity, called Athanasian, in which are these words: "The Father is eternal and infinite, the Son is eternal and infinite, and the Holy Spirit is eternal and infinite, but yet there are not three eternals and infinites, but one;" that this one is the Lord, is demonstrated in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 13 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>13. "Ab Ipso Qui Est et Qui Fuit et Qui Venturus," significat a Domino Qui est Aeternus ac Infinitus, et Jehovah. - Quod sit Dominus, patet manifeste a sequentibus in hoc capite, ubi dicitur quod audiverit vocem ex Filio Hominis dicentem, <p>"Ego sum Alpha et Omega. Primus et Ultimus," (vers. 11, 13);<p>et dein: <p>"Ego sum Primus et Ultimus," (vers. 17);<p>et in sequente capite, vers. 8; et postea <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_13/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_6" target=_top>21:6</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_13/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_22_12-13" target=_top>22:12-13</a>; et apud Esajam: <p>"Dixit Jehovah Rex Israelis, et Redemptor ejus Jehovah Zebaoth; Ego Primus et Ego Ultimus, et praeter ille non Deus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_13/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_44_6" target=_top>44:6</a>; tum cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_13/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_48_12" target=_top>48:12</a>);<p>et "Qui Est Primus et Ultimus," est "Qui Est, Qui Fuit, et Qui Venturus." Hoc quoque intelligitur per "Jehovam;" nomen "Jehovae" enim significat Est; et Qui Est, seu Qui est ipsum ESSE, est quoque Fuit et Venturus, sunt enim praeterita et futura in Ipso praesentia; inde est absque tempore Aeternus, et absque loco Infinitus: hoc quoque Ecclesia confitetur ex Doctrina Trinitatis, quae Athanasiana vocatur, ubi haec: "Pater est Aeternus et Infinitus, Filius est Aeternus et Infinitus, et Spiritus Sanctus est Aeternus et Infinitus, sed tamen non sunt tres Aeterni et Infiniti, sed Unus;" quod Ille Unus sit Dominus, in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino demonstratum est. </p>
