<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第262节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>262.“观看书卷”表一点也不能。由于“展开书卷”表示知道所有人的生命状态，“观看书卷”表示查看这人或那人的生命状态，故“没有人能展开、能观看那书卷”表示他们一点也不能。因为唯独主从最内层到最外层看到每个人的生命状态，以及看到人从婴孩到终老是什么样，他将来直到永恒是什么样，同样看到要么在天堂，要么在地狱分配给他的是什么地方。主凭自己瞬间洞悉这一切，因为祂是神性真理本身，或圣言。而天使和世人则一点也看不到，因为他们是有限的，有限者只能些许的事，而且只能看到表面，事实上，连这些也不是凭自己，而是凭主。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 262</h4><p>262. Or to look in it. This symbolically means, not the least power.<p>Since to open the book means, symbolically, to know the states of life of all, to look in it means, symbolically, to see the character of this or that person's state of life. Consequently, that no one could open the book or look in it means, symbolically, that they had not the least power to do so. For the Lord alone sees the state of each person's life from its inmost qualities to its outmost ones, including what the person was like from infancy to old age and what he will be like to eternity, as well as to what place he will be assigned in heaven or in hell. Moreover, the Lord sees this instantaneously, and does so of Himself, because He is Divine truth itself or the Word. Angels and people, on the other hand, cannot do this in the least, because they are finite, and finite people see only a few, outward qualities; and even these they do not see of themselves, but from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 262</h4><p>262. 'Nor to look into it' signifies not at all. Since by 'to open the book' is signified to get to know the states of life of all, by 'to look into it' is signified to see the quality of the states of life of this person and that; and therefore by 'no one being able to open the book nor to look into it' is signified that it is not at all possible. For the Only Lord sees anyone's state from inmosts to outmosts, as well as what a man has been from infancy onwards to old age, and what he is going to be to eternity, as also what place will be obtained in heaven or in hell, and the Lord sees this in an instant, and of Himself, because He is Divine Truth Itself or the Word. Angels and men, however, do not see this at all, because they are finite, and the finite see only a few external things, and these they do not see from themselves but from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 262</h4><p>262. Neither to look thereon, signifies not in the least. Since by "opening the book," is signified to know the states of life of all, by "looking on it" is signified to see what the state of life of this or that person is, therefore by "no one being able to open the book nor to look thereon," is signified that they were not able in the least. For the Lord alone sees the state of everyone from inmosts to outmosts, as also what a man has been from infancy to old age, and what he will be to eternity, and likewise what place will be allotted to him either in heaven or in hell; and this the Lord sees in an instant, and from Himself, because He is the Divine truth itself or the Word; but angels and man do not see this in the least, because they are finite, and the finite see only a few things, and those only external, and not these indeed from themselves, but from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 262 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>262. "Nec inspicere eum," significat ne hilum. - Cum per "aperire librum" significatur nosse status vitae omnium, per "inspicere eum" significatur videre qualis status vitae unius et alterius est; quare per quod "nemo posset aperire librum nec inspicere eum," significatur quod ne hilum possint. Solus enim Dominus videt statum cujusvis ab intimis ad extrema, tum qualis homo fuit ab infantia usque ad senectam, et qualis futurus est in aeternum, ut et quem locum in Caelo vel in inferno sortiturus sit; et hoc Dominus videt in instanti, et ex Se Ipso, quia est Ipsum Divinum Verum seu Verbum; angeli autem et homo ne hilum, quia sunt finiti, et finiti vident modo pauca et externa, et ne quidem haec vident a se, sed a Domino. </p>
