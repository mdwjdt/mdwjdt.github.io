<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第335节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>335.启6:14.“天就挪移，好像书卷被卷起来”表与天堂分离，与地狱结合。经上之所以说“天就挪移，好像书卷被卷起来”，是因为人的内在认知和由此而来的思维好像天堂；他的认知能被提升到天堂之光中，还能在这种提升中与天使一样思想神、爱与信，以及永生。然而，若他的意愿未同时被提升到天堂之热中，此人便不会与天堂天使结合，因而不像天堂。这一事实可见于《圣爱与圣智》第5章。凭着这种认知官能，此处所论述的恶者能与底层天的天使发生联系；但当这些天使与恶者分离时，他们的天就挪移，好像“书卷被卷起来”。“书卷被卷起来”表示羊皮纸被卷起来，因为他们的书籍是羊皮纸，并以书卷作比，“书卷”是圣言（<a href="256.htm">256</a>节）；因此，当它像羊皮纸那样被卷起来时，其中的内容就显现不出来了，仿佛不存在了。因此缘故，以赛亚书中有类似的话：</p><p>天上的万象都要消没，天被卷起，好像书卷，星辰殒坠，像叶子从无花果树凋落一样。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛34.4.htm">34:4</a>）</p><p>“万象”是指教会取自圣言的良善与真理（<a href="447.htm">447</a>节）。由此可见，“天就挪移，好像书卷被卷起来”表与天堂分离，与地狱结合。显而易见，与天分离就是与地狱结合。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 335</h4><p>335. Then the sky departed like a book rolled up. (<a href="3927/revelation_6_14.htm">6:14</a>) This symbolizes the people's separation from heaven and conjunction with hell.<p>The text says that the sky departed like a book rolled up because a person's inner intellect and thus thought is as the sky or a kind of heaven, for his intellect can be raised into the light of heaven and can think about God, love and faith, and eternal life on the same elevated level as angels. But if his will is not raised at the same time into the warmth of heaven, the person is not yet united with the angels of heaven, thus is not a kind of heaven. The reality of this may be seen in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom, Part Five.<p>Through this faculty of the intellect, the evil people who are the subject here could be associated with angels of the lowest heaven. But when the two were separated, their heaven then departed, like a book rolled up.<p>A book rolled up means a parchment rolled up, since their books were scrolls of parchment, and the comparison is made with a book, since a book also means the Word (no. <a href="256.htm">256</a>). Consequently, when it is rolled up like a scroll, whatever it contains is not visible, and it is as though gone.<p>Something similar is accordingly said in Isaiah:<p>All the host of heaven shall waste away, and the heavens shall be rolled up like a book, and... it falls down as the leaf falls... from a fig tree. (<a href="3927/isaiah_34_4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>)<p>The host of heaven is the church's goods and truths from the Word (no. <a href="447.htm">447</a>).<p>It can be seen from this that "the sky departed like a book rolled up" symbolizes separation from heaven and conjunction with hell. That separation from heaven means conjunction with hell, is apparent. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 335</h4><p>335. [verse 14] 'And the heaven departed as a book rolled up' signifies separation from heaven and conjunction with hell. It is said that 'the heaven departed as a book rolled up' because a man's interior understanding and the thought therefrom is like a heaven, for his understanding can be elevated into the light of heaven, and in the elevation can think equally with the angels concerning God, love and faith, and eternal life; but if his will is not at the same time elevated into the heat of heaven the man as yet is not conjoined to the angels of heaven, thus he is not like a heaven. That this is the case may be seen in ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM, in the Fifth Part. By means of this faculty of the understanding, the evil who are treated of here were able to be associated with angels of the ultimate heaven; bit when these were separated from them, then their heaven departed as 'a book rolled up.' By 'a book rolled up' is understood a rolled up parchment, since their books were parchments, and the comparison is made with 'a book,' because the 'book' is the Word (<a href="256.htm">256</a>), and therefore when it is rolled up as a parchment nothing is apparent of what is therein, and it is as if it did not exist. On this account a similar thing is said in Isaiah:<p>Every army of the heavens is wasting away, and the heavens are being rolled together as a book, and it is falling down as the leaf falls down from the fig-tree. <a href="3927/isaiah_34_4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>.<p>The 'army' are the goods and truths of the Church out of the Word (<a href="447.htm">447</a>). From these considerations it can be established that by 'the heaven departed as a book rolled up' separation from heaven is signified, and conjunction with hell. That separation from heaven is conjunction with hell is plain. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 335</h4><p>335. Verse 14. And heaven departed as a book rolled together, signifies separation from heaven and conjunction with hell. It is said that "heaven departed as a book rolled together," because the interior understanding, and hence the thought, of man is as heaven; for his understanding can be elevated into the light of heaven and in such elevation can think with the angels concerning God, concerning love and faith, and concerning eternal life: but if his will is not at the same time elevated into the heat of heaven, the man is not conjoined with the angels of heaven, thus is not like heaven. That this is the case, may be seen in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Love and Wisdom, Chapter 5. By virtue of this faculty of the understanding, the evil who are here treated of, could be in consociation with the angels of the ultimate heaven; but when these were separated from the former, their heaven departed as "a book rolled together." By "a book rolled together" is meant parchment, rolled up, because their books were parchments, and the comparison is made with a book, because the book is the Word, (<a href="256.htm">256</a>); therefore when it is rolled up like a parchment, nothing that it contains is apparent, and it is as though it were not. On this account the like is said in Isaiah:<p>And all the host of heaven shall waste away, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a book, and shall fall down as the leaf falleth from the fig tree, (<a href="3927/isaiah_34_4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>).<p>"Hosts" are the goods and truths of the church from the Word, (<a href="447.htm">447</a>). From these things it may appear, that by "heaven departing as a book rolled together," is signified separation from heaven, and conjunction with hell. That separation from heaven is conjunction with hell, is evident. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 335 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>335. (Vers. 14) "Et caelum abscessit sicut liber convolutus," significat separationem a Caelo et conjunctionem cum Inferno. -Quod dicatur quod "Caelum abscesserit sicut liber convolutus," est quia interior intellectus et inde cogitatio hominis est sicut Caelum potest enim intellectus ejus elevari in lucem Caeli, et in elevatione una cum Angelis cogitare de Deo, de Amore et Fide, et de Vita aeterna; sed si voluntas ejus non simul elevatur in calorem Caeli, usque homo non est conjunctus Angelis Caeli, ita non est sicut Caelum: quod ita sit, videatur in Sapientia Angelica de Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia (in parte quinta). Per illam intellectus facultatem potuerunt mali, de quibus hic agitur, in consociatione esse cum Angelis Caeli Ultimi; at cum hi ab illis separati sunt, tunc abscessit Caelum illorum, "sicut liber convolutus." Per "librum convolutum" intelligitur membrana convoluta, quoniam libri illorum fuerunt membranae; et comparatio fit cum libro, quia liber etiam est Verbum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_335/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256" target=_top>256</a>); quare cum id ut membrana convolvitur, non apparet quidquam quod inibi, et est sicut non sit. Propterea simile dicitur apud Esajam: <p>"Contabescet omnis exercitus caelorum, et convolventur Caeli sicut Liber, ac decidit sicut folium decidit de ficu," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_335/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_34_4" target=_top>34:4</a>);<p>"exercitus" sunt bona et vera Ecclesiae ex Verbo (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_335/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_447" target=_top>447</a>). Ex his constare potest, quod per "Caelum abscessit sicut liber convolutus" significetur separatio a Caelo, et conjunctio cum Inferno: quod separatio a Caelo sit conjunctio cum Inferno, patet. </p>
