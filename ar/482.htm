<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第482节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>482.启10:10.“我从天使手中把小书卷接过来，吃尽了，在我口中果然甜如蜜，及至吃完了，肚子觉得发苦了”表事情果然如此发生了，因而显明，在“龙”、“兽”和“假先知”所表示的那些人被除去之前，对该教义的接受将遭遇何种情形。这是前面所述的一个结果，故无需进一步解释。经上记着说，先知以西结也被吩咐：</p><p>去吃一卷书，在他口中觉得甜如蜜。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结2.8.htm">2:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结2.10.htm">10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.1.htm">3:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.3.htm">3</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 482</h4><p>482. Then I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it, and in my mouth it was as sweet as honey. (<a href="3927/revelation_10_10.htm">10:10</a>) But when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter. This symbolically means that so it came to pass, and thus it was shown, how this doctrine would be received before those people meant by the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet were removed.<p>Because this follows as a consequence from the aforesaid, it needs no further exposition.<p>We read that the prophet Ezekiel, too, was commanded to eat the scroll of a book, and that it was in his mouth as sweet as honey (<a href="3927/ezekiel_2_8.htm">Ezekiel 2:8-10</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_1.htm">3:1-3</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 482</h4><p>482. [verse 10] 'And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up, and it was in my mouth as sweet honey, and when I ate it up my belly was made bitter' signifies it was so done, and thus was made manifest what the reception of that doctrine would be, before those who are understood by 'the dragon,' 'the beast' and 'the false prophet' were removed. As this is a consequence of the things said above, it is not being further expounded. We read that the prophet Ezekiel also by command ate a roll of a book, and that it was in his mouth sweet as honey (<a href="3927/ezekiel_2_8.htm">Ezekiel 2:8-10</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_1.htm">3:1-4</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 482</h4><p>482. Verse 10. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey, and when I had eaten it my belly was made bitter, signifies that so it came to pass, and was thus manifested what reception that doctrine would meet with, before they who are meant by "the dragon," "the beast," and "the false prophet," were removed. As this is a consequence of what was said above, it needs no further explanation. It is written that the prophet Ezekiel was also commanded:<p>To eat the volume of the book, and that in his mouth it was sweet as honey, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_2_8.htm">Ezekiel 2:8-10</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_1.htm">3:1-3</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 482 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>482. (Vers. 10.) "Et accepi Libellum e manu Angeli et devoravi illum, et erat in ore meo sicut mel dulcis; et cum devoravi illum, amaricatus est venter meus," significat ita factum, et sic manifestatum qualis foret receptio illius doctrinae, antequam illi, qui per "Draconem," "Bestiam" et "Pseudoprophetam" intelliguntur, remoti sunt. - Hoc quia est consequens ex supradictis, non ulterius explicatur. Legitur quod etiam Propheta Ezechiel ex mandato Comederit Volumen Libri, et quod illud fuerit in ore ejus dulce sicut mel, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_482/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_2_8-10" target=_top>Ezechiel 2:8-10</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_482/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_3_1-3" target=_top>3:1-3</a>). <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;1-3 pro "1 ad 4" </p>
