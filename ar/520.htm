<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>520.“天上就有大声音说，世上的国成了我们主和主基督的，祂要掌权，世世无穷”表天使的祝贺，因为天堂和教会成了主的，如起初那样，还因为现在它们成了其神性人的国度，因而主将在这两方面（即神性和人性）统治天堂和教会，直到永远。“有大声音”表示天使的祝贺；“说，世上的国成了我们主和主基督的”表示天堂和教会成了主的，如起初那样，现在它们也成了其神性人的国度；“祂要掌权，世世无穷”表示主在其人性和神性方面统治它们。“天上的大声音”表示对主的祝贺，因为祂现在取得祂的大能，这一点从17节明显看出来，那里概括了“这些大声音”。“主”在此是指永恒之主，也就是耶和华；“基督”是指祂的神性人，也就是神的儿子（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.32.htm">1:32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.35.htm">35</a>）。</p><p>就其神性人而言，主也将掌权，这一点从下面这些话看得很清楚：</p><p>父已将万有交在子手里。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.35.htm">3:35</a>）</p><p>父赐给子权柄管理凡有血气的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.2.htm">17:2</a>）</p><p>父啊，凡我的，都是你的，你的也是我的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.10.htm">17:10</a>）</p><p>天上地上所有的权柄都赐给我了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">28:18</a>）</p><p>论到祂的神性人，主还说：</p><p>父与祂为一。祂在父里面，父在祂里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.30.htm">10:30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.38.htm">38</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.5.htm">14:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>对此，需要补充的是，若主的人性不被承认为神性，教会必灭亡，因为在这种情况下，主就无法在人里面，人也无法在祂里面，如祂自己所教导的（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">14:20</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.4.htm">15:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.6.htm">6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.21.htm">17:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.23.htm">23</a>）；这种结合便构成教会之人，因而构成教会。</p><p>“基督”之所以表示主的神性人，是因为“基督”就是“弥赛亚”，而“弥赛亚”就是被期望来到世上的神的儿子。“基督”就是“弥赛亚”，这一事实从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>我们遇见弥赛亚了，弥赛亚翻出来就是基督。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.41.htm">1:41</a>）</p><p>妇人，我知道弥赛亚，就是那称为基督的，要来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.25.htm">4:25</a>）</p><p>在希伯来语，“弥赛亚”是指“受膏者”，如“基督”在希腊语中的意思。“弥赛亚”就是“神的儿子”，这一事实从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>大祭司问祂是不是基督（即弥赛亚），神的儿子。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.63.htm">26:63</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可22.67.htm">22:67</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.31.htm">20:31</a>）</p><p>你是基督，神的儿子，就是那要临到世界的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.27.htm">11:27</a>）</p><p>彼得说，我们已经信了，承认你是基督和永生神的儿子。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.69.htm">6:69</a>）</p><p>就神性人而言，主是神的儿子：</p><p>天使对马利亚说，你要怀孕生子；祂要为大，称为至高者的儿子。圣灵要临到你，至高者的能力要荫庇你；因此你所要生的圣者必称为神的儿子。（路加福音1；31，32，35等）</p><p>由此明显可知“世上的国成了我主和主基督的”表示什么。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 520</h4><p>520. And there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!" This symbolizes celebrations on the part of angels, that heaven and the church had become the Lord's, as they had been from the beginning, and that they had now become those of His Divine humanity, thus that the Lord would reign over heaven and earth as regards both aspects of Him to eternity.<p>"There were loud voices in heaven" symbolizes celebrations on the part of angels. "Saying, 'The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ,'" means, symbolically, that heaven and the church had become the Lord's, as they had been from the beginning, and now had become those of His Divine humanity. "And He shall reign forever and ever!" means, symbolically, that the Lord would reign over them as regards both aspects of Him.<p>Loud voices in heaven symbolize celebrations of the Lord for having now taken His great power, as is apparent from verse <a href="3927/revelation_11_17.htm">17</a> following, where the substance of those great voices is presented.<p>The Lord here means the Lord from eternity, who is Jehovah, and the Christ here means His Divine humanity, which is the Son of God (<a href="3927/luke_1_32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">35</a>).</p><p>[2] That the Lord will reign even as regards His Divine humanity is clearly apparent from the following passages:<p>The Father... has given all things into His (the Son's) hand. (<a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>)<p>(The Father has) given (the Son) authority over all flesh... (<a href="3927/john_17_2.htm">John 17:2</a>)<p>(Father,) all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine... (<a href="3927/john_17_10.htm">John 17:10</a>)<p>All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>)<p>In reference to His Divine humanity the Lord also says that the Father and He are one, and that He is in the Father, and the Father in Him (<a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_38.htm">38</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_5.htm">14:5-12</a>).<p>Furthermore, if the Lord's humanity is not acknowledged to be Divine, the church perishes, since the Lord cannot then be in man and man in the Lord, as He teaches in <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">15:4-6</a>; <a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">17:21</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_23.htm">23</a>; and it is this conjunction that makes a person a person of the church, thus that makes the church a church.</p><p>[3] The Christ means the Lord's Divine humanity because the Christ is the Messiah, and the Messiah is the Son of God whose coming into the world was awaited by the Jews.<p>That the Christ is the Messiah is apparent from the following passages:<p>We have found the Messiah, which, if you translate it, is the Christ. (<a href="3927/john_1_41.htm">John 1:41</a>)<p>The woman said to Him, "I know that Messiah is coming, who is called Christ." (<a href="3927/john_4_25.htm">John 4:25</a>)<p>The reason is that Messiah in Hebrew means Anointed, as does Christ in Greek.<p>That the Messiah is the Son of God is apparent from the fact that the high priest asked Him whether He was "the Christ (i.e., the Messiah), the Son of God" (<a href="3927/matthew_26_63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>, <a href="3927/mark_14_61.htm">Mark 14:61</a>, cf. <a href="3927/john_20_31.htm">John 20:31</a>). Also from the following:<p>...You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world. (<a href="3927/john_11_27.htm">John 11:27</a>)<p>(Peter said,) "We believe and acknowledge that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." (<a href="3927/john_6_69.htm">John 6:69</a>)<p>That the Lord is the Son of God in respect to His Divine humanity:<p>(The angel said to Mary,) "You will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son... He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest... The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born of you will be called the Son of God. (<a href="3927/luke_1_31.htm">Luke 1:31-32</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">35</a>)<p>And so on in many places elsewhere.<p>It is apparent from this what is symbolically meant by the statement that the kingdoms have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 520</h4><p>520. 'And great voices were produced in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world have become our Lord's and His Christ's, and He shall reign for ages of ages' signifies celebrations by the angels, that heaven and the Church have become the Lord's, as they were from the beginning, and that now also they have become [the heaven and Church] of His Divine Human, thus that the Lord as to both [the Divine and the Divine Human] is now going to reign over heaven and the Church to eternity. 'Great voices were produced' signifies celebrations by the angels; 'saying, The kingdoms of the world have become our Lord's and His Christ's' signifies that heaven and the Church have become the Lord's, as they were from the beginning, and now also they have become [the heaven and Church] of His Divine Human; 'and He shall reign for ages of ages' signifies that the Lord is going to reign as to both [the Divine and the Divine Human]. That 'great voices in heaven' signify celebrations of the Lord, that now He has attained His great power, is plain from verse 17 (following), where those 'great voices' set themselves forth in a summary (in summa exstant). By 'the Lord' here is understood the Lord from eternity, Who is Jehovah, and by 'Christ' is understood His Divine Human, which is the Son of God (<a href="3927/luke_1_32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">35</a>).</p><p>[2] That the Lord is going to reign even as to His Divine Human is quite plain from these statements:<p>The Father has given all things into the hand of the Son. <a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>.<p>The Father has given the Son authority over all flesh. <a href="3927/john_17_2.htm">John 17:2</a>.<p>Father, all Mine are Thine, and Thine Mine. <a href="3927/john_17_10.htm">John 17:10</a>.<p>All authority has been given unto Me in heaven and earth. <a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>.<p>Of His Divine Human He also said:<p>That the Father and Himself are one.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 520</h4><p>520.

"There were great voices" signifies celebrations by the angels; saying, "The kingdoms of the world are become our Lord's and His Christ's" signifies that heaven and the church are become the Lord's, as they were from the beginning, and that now they are also the kingdom of His Divine Human; "and He shall reign for ages of ages" signifies that the Lord, both as to His Human and Divine, will reign over them. "Great voices in heaven" signify celebrations of the Lord, because He has now taken His great power, appears from verse 17 where "those great voices" are extant in a summary. By "the Lord" is here meant the Lord from eternity, who is Jehovah; and by "Christ" is meant His Divine Human, which is the Son of God, (<a href="3927/luke_1_32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>, <a href="3927/luke_1_35.htm">35</a>).</p><p>[2] That the Lord as to His Divine Human also will reign, manifestly appears from these words:<p>The Father hath given all things into the hand of the Son, (<a href="3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>).<p>The Father hath given the Son power over all flesh, (<a href="3927/john_17_2.htm">John 17:2</a>).<p>Father, all Mine are Thine and Thine are Mine, (<a href="3927/john_17_10.htm">John 17:10</a>).<p>All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth, (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p>Of His Divine Human he also said that:<p>The Father and He are one.

That Christ is the Messiah appears from this:<p>We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ, (<a href="3927/john_1_41.htm">John 1:41</a>).<p>The woman said, I know that the Messiah cometh, which is called Christ, (<a href="3927/john_4_25.htm">John 4:25</a>).<p>For "Messiah," in the Hebrew language, is the Anointed, as Christ is in the Greek language.
