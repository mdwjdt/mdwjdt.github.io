<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>717. 7-16章（包括16章）论述改革宗（或新教）；本章和下一章论述天主教徒，他们当中那些自称有权柄打开关闭天堂的人就以“巴比伦”来表示。所以，此处有必要先说明“巴比伦”具体表示什么。“巴比伦”或“巴别”表示出于自我之爱对统治教会神圣事物的爱，这爱会随着约束它的缰绳放松而攀升；由于教会的神圣事物也是天堂的神圣事物，故“巴比伦”或“巴别”也表示对天堂的统治。由于这爱如此扮演魔鬼的角色，而魔鬼就渴求这种事，所以它不可避免地通过玷污圣言的良善和真理来亵渎神圣事物，因此“巴比伦”或“巴别”也表示对神圣事物的亵渎，以及对圣言良善和真理的玷污。这就是此处启示录中“巴比伦”，以及以下预言和历史圣言经文中“巴别”的含义：</p><p>论巴别：看哪，耶和华的日子临到，必有残忍；天上的众星群宿，都不发光。日头一出，就变黑暗，月亮也不放光。我必使骄傲人的狂妄止息，制伏强暴人的狂傲。巴别素来为列国的荣耀，必像神所倾覆的所多玛蛾摩拉一样。只有旷野的走兽卧在那里。咆哮的兽满了房屋。猫头鹰的女儿住在那里。野山羊（萨梯）在那里跳舞。豺狼必在她宫中呼号。野狗必在她华美殿内吼叫。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.1.htm">13:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.9.htm">9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.21.htm">21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.22.htm">22</a>）</p><p>此外还有这一整章中的许多其它内容。</p><p>你必提这诗歌论巴比伦王说，你的威势下到阴间；路西弗啊，你何竟从天坠落，你心里曾说，我要升到天上。我要高举我的宝座在神众星以上。我要升到高云之上。我要变得像至高者；然而你必被抛下阴间；我必兴起攻击你，将巴别的名号，和所余剩的人，一并剪除。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.4.htm">14:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.11.htm">11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.22.htm">22</a>）</p><p>此外还有这一整章中的更多内容。</p><p>耶和华论巴比伦所说的话：你们的母亲就极其抱愧，生你们的必然蒙羞；看哪，最后的结局必是旷野，干地，沙漠。你们要在巴别的四围摆阵，射箭攻击她。不要爱惜箭枝；巴别在列族中何竟荒凉。她向耶和华以色列的圣者发了狂傲。有干旱临到她的众水，使它们干涸。因为这是有雕刻偶像之地，它以可怕之物为荣耀；所以旷野的走兽和豺狼必住在那里，猫头鹰也住在其中，像神倾覆所多玛，蛾摩拉一样。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.1.htm">50:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.29.htm">29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.31.htm">31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.38.htm">38</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.40.htm">40</a>）</p><p>此外还有这一整章中论到“巴别”的其它许多内容。</p><p>巴别素来是耶和华手中的金杯，使全地都喝醉；列族喝了她的酒就颠狂了。离开她吧，因为她受的审判通于上天，直到云霄；看哪，你这行毁灭的山哪，就是毁灭全地的山，我与你反对。我必将你从山岩滚下去，使你成为烧毁的山。我必刑罚巴别的彼勒，使他从口中吐出所吞的。万民必不再流归他那里。巴别的城墙也必坍塌了。看哪，日子将到，我必刑罚巴别雕刻的偶像。她全地必然抱愧。巴别虽升到天上，虽使她坚固的高处更坚固，还有行毁灭的从我而来。我必使巴比伦的首领，智慧人，省长，副省长，和勇士都沉醉，使他们睡了长觉，永不醒起。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.1.htm">51:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.25.htm">25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.44.htm">44</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.47.htm">47</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.53.htm">53</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.57.htm">57</a>）</p><p>此外还有这一整章中论到“巴别”的其它许多内容。</p><p>巴别的处女阿，下来坐在尘埃，坐在地上；因为没有宝座；要用磨磨面。露腿趟河，你的裸体必被露出，你的丑陋必被看见。你自己说，我必永为主母，所以你不思想结局；你素来倚仗自己的恶行，说，无人看见我。你的智慧，聪明，使你偏邪，并且你心里说，惟有我，除我以外再没有别的；祸患必忽然来临，你却不知道；继续使用你从幼年劳神施行的符咒，和你许多的邪术，或者可得益处，或者能叫人害怕。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.1.htm">47:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.10.htm">10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>此外还有这一章中论到“巴别”或“巴比伦”的其它内容。</p><p>以下经文表示类似事物：</p><p>他们从东边迁移想要在示拿地山谷建造一座城和一座塔，塔顶通天，耶和华从天上降临，变乱他们的口音；因此，那地之名叫“巴别”（变乱）。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创11.1.htm">11:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创11.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>以下但以理书经文表示类似事物：</p><p>巴别王尼布甲尼撒所看到的这像，脚是半铁半泥的，有一块非人手凿出来的石头打在这脚上，把脚砸碎，这像的各个部分成如禾场上的糠秕；这石头变成一个大磐石。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.31.htm">2:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.47.htm">47</a>）</p><p>巴别王尼布甲尼撒造了一个大像，下令他们在它面前俯伏敬拜；凡不俯伏敬拜的，必扔在烈火的窑中。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但3.1.htm">3:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但3.7.htm">7</a>等）</p><p>那树渐长，高得顶天，从地极都能看见，有一位守望者和圣者从天而降，呼叫说，伐倒这树，砍下枝子，摇掉叶子，抛散果子；因为它代表巴别王，所以他被赶出离开世人，与兽同居，吃草如牛。（但以理书4章）</p><p>巴别王伯沙撒与大臣、皇后、妃嫔，用耶路撒冷殿中所掠的金银器皿饮酒，赞美金、银、铜、铁、木、石所造的神；因此，墙上有字，当天这王自己被杀。（但以理书5章） </p><p>巴别大流士王照玛代的例立这禁令：三十日内，不拘何人，若在王以外，或向神或向人求什么，就必扔在狮子坑中。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但6.7.htm">6:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但6.28.htm">28</a>）</p><p>但以理所看到从海中上来的四个兽，其中第四兽甚是可怕，大有力量，有大铁牙，吞吃嚼碎，所剩下的用脚践踏，要行审判，案卷都展开了，那兽被杀，扔在火中焚烧；然后有一位像人子的，驾着天云而来，得了权柄、荣耀、国度，使众民、众族和众方言都敬拜祂；祂的权柄是永远的权柄，不能废去，祂的国必不败坏。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.1.htm">7:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.14.htm">14</a>等）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 717</h4><p>717. REVELATION: CHAPTER 17<p>1. Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying to me, "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,<p>2. with whom the kings of the earth committed whoredom, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her licentiousness."<p>3. So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.<p>4. The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the filthiness of her licentiousness.<p>5. And on her forehead a name was written: Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of the Whoredoms and Abominations of the Earth.<p>6. And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered with great wonder.<p>7. But the angel said to me, "Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.<p>8. The beast that you saw was, and is not, and will ascend out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth will marvel, those whose names have not been written in the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.<p>9. This is the mind which has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.<p>10. They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come. And when he comes, he must remain a short time.<p>11. And the beast that was, and is not, is itself the eighth, and is of the seven, and is going to destruction.<p>12. The ten horns which you saw are ten kings that have not yet received a kingdom, but receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast.<p>13. These are of one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast.<p>14. These will do battle with the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and those who are with Him are called, chosen, and faithful."<p>15. Then he said to me, "The waters that you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes, nations and tongues.<p>16. And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these will hate the harlot, make her desolate and naked, eat her flesh and burn her with fire.<p>17. For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His purpose, and to be of one mind and give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.<p>18. And the woman whom you saw is the great city which holds sway over the kings of the earth."<p>THE SPIRITUAL MEANING<p>The Contents of the Whole Chapter<p>The subject is the Roman Catholic religion. Described is the way in which it falsified the Word and so perverted all the church's truths (verses 1-7). How it falsified these and perverted them among peoples subject to its dominion (verses 8-11), but less among peoples who had not so subjected themselves to its dominion (verses 12-15).<p>Regarding the Protestant Reformed, that they had withdrawn themselves from the yoke of its domination (verse 16, 17). Its continuing domination anyway (verse 18).<p>The Contents of the Individual Verses:<p></p><table><thead><tr><th>Verse Contents</th><th>Spiritual Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me,</td><td>Influx now and a revelation from the Lord from the inmost of heaven about the Roman Catholic religion,</td></tr><tr><td>saying to me, "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,</td><td>a revelation about that religion as regards its profanations and adulterations of the Word's truths,</td></tr><tr><td>2. with whom the kings of the earth committed whoredom,</td><td>that it adulterated the church's goods and truths that it had from the Word.</td></tr><tr><td>and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her licentiousness."</td><td>Its insanity in spiritual matters owing to the adulteration of the Word among those immersed in that religion.</td></tr><tr><td>3. So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness.</td><td>John's being carried away in a spiritual state to people in whom everything of the church had been destroyed.</td></tr><tr><td>And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of names of blasphemy,</td><td>That religion resting on the Word that they profaned.</td></tr><tr><td>having seven heads and ten horns.</td><td>Their intelligence gained from the Word, at first reverent, later abandoned, and at last irrational, and their continued great power drawn from the Word.</td></tr><tr><td>4. The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet,</td><td>The celestial Divine good and truth contained in the Word among them.</td></tr><tr><td>and adorned with gold and precious stones</td><td>The spiritual Divine good and truth contained in the Word among them.</td></tr><tr><td>and pearls,</td><td>The concepts of goodness and truth contained in the Word among them.</td></tr><tr><td>having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the filthiness of her licentiousness.</td><td>That religion derived from the sacred contents of the Word profaned, and from its goods and truths defiled by dreadful falsities.</td></tr><tr><td>5. And on her forehead a name was written: Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of the Whoredoms and Abominations of the Earth.</td><td>The Roman Catholic religion such as it is interiorly, which is concealed, that from its origin, springing from a love of exercising dominion from a love of self over the sanctities of the church and over heaven, thus over everything connected with the Lord and His Word, it defiled and profaned things having to do with the Word and so with the church.</td></tr><tr><td>6. And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus.</td><td>That religion irrational because of its adulterating and profaning the Divine truths and goods of the Lord, of the Word, and so of the church.</td></tr><tr><td>And when I saw her, I wondered with great wonder.</td><td>Astonishment that that religion is of such a character interiorly, when indeed it appears otherwise outwardly.</td></tr><tr><td>7. But the angel said to me, "Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.</td><td>A disclosure of the symbolic meaning of the preceding events and scenes.</td></tr><tr><td>8. The beast that you saw was, and is not,</td><td>The Word among them acknowledged as holy, and yet really not acknowledged.</td></tr><tr><td>and will ascend out of the abyss and go to destruction.</td><td>The laity's and common people's being given the Word and reading it deliberated several times in the papal Consistory, but rejected.</td></tr><tr><td>And those who dwell on the earth will marvel, those whose names have not been written in the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</td><td>The astonishment of those who belong to that religion, of all those who from its commencement strove for dominion over heaven and earth, that even though the Word had been thus rejected, still it endures.</td></tr><tr><td>9. This is the mind which has wisdom:</td><td>This is the interpretation in the natural sense, but intended for people who have the spiritual meaning from the Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits. 10. They are also seven kings.</td><td>The Divine goods and truths in the Word on which that religion was founded, in time destroyed and finally profaned.</td></tr><tr><td>Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come. And when he comes, he must remain a short time.</td><td>The Word's Divine truths have all been destroyed but this one, that the Lord was given all authority in heaven and on earth, and a second one, which has not yet been called into question, and when it is, will not survive, namely, that the Lord's humanity is Divine.</td></tr><tr><td>11. And the beast that was, and is not, is itself the eighth, and is of the seven, and is going to destruction.</td><td>The Word, as mentioned previously, is Divine good itself and Divine truth, and it has been taken from the laity and common people to keep the Roman Catholic hierarchy's profanations and adulterations of it from appearing, and the people's turning away on that account.</td></tr><tr><td>12. The ten horns which you saw are ten kings that have not yet received a kingdom,</td><td>The Word as to the power it has from Divine truths among Roman Catholics who live in France and are not so much under the yoke of papal dominion, who nevertheless have not yet formed among them therefore a church separate from the Roman Catholic religion.</td></tr><tr><td>but receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast.</td><td>The Word has force with them, and through the Word they prevail, as though they possessed its Divine truths.</td></tr><tr><td>13. These are of one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast.</td><td>They unanimously acknowledge that the only means of government and dominion over the church is through the Word.</td></tr><tr><td>14. These will do battle with the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings;</td><td>The Lord's battle with them over an acknowledgment of His Divine humanity, because the Lord in that humanity is God of heaven and earth and also the Word.</td></tr><tr><td>and those who are with Him are called, chosen, and faithful."</td><td>People who turn to the Lord and worship Him alone are those who go to heaven, both those concerned with the external elements of the church and those concerned with its internal and inmost elements.</td></tr><tr><td>15. Then he said to me, "The waters that you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes, nations and tongues.</td><td>Under papal dominion, but caught up in various ways in that religion's adulterated and profaned truths of the Word, are peoples of a varying doctrine and discipline, and of a varying religion and confession of it.</td></tr><tr><td>16. And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these will hate the harlot,</td><td>The Word as to the power it has from Divine truths among Protestants, who have thrown off entirely the yoke of papal dominion.</td></tr><tr><td>make her desolate and naked,</td><td>They will rid themselves of its falsities and evils.</td></tr><tr><td>eat her flesh and burn her with fire.</td><td>They will with hatred condemn and destroy in themselves the evils and falsities inherent in that religion, and will renounce the religion itself and expunge it in themselves.</td></tr><tr><td>17. For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His purpose, and to be of one mind and give their kingdom to the beast,</td><td>A judgment among them from the Lord that they should utterly repudiate and renounce the Roman Catholic religion and expunge and eradicate it in themselves, and a unanimous judgment that they should acknowledge the Word and found the church on it.</td></tr><tr><td>until the words of God are fulfilled.</td><td>Until all the things foretold about them have been fulfilled.</td></tr><tr><td>18. And the woman whom you saw is the great city which holds sway over the kings of the earth."</td><td>The Roman Catholic religion will reign as to doctrine in the Christian world, and to some extent still also among the Protestant Reformed, even though the latter are not under papal dominion.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>THE EXPOSITION<p>The Protestant Reformed were the subject before this in chapters 7-16. The subject now in this chapter and the next is Roman Catholics, and those among them who claim for themselves the power of opening and closing heaven are meant by Babylon. We must first say here, therefore, what Babylon means specifically.<p>Babylon or Babel means a love of ruling over the sanctities of the church stemming from a love of self, and because this love increases to the degree it is given free rein, and the sanctities of the church are also the sanctities of heaven, therefore Babylon or Babel symbolizes dominion over heaven as well.<p>Moreover, because this love thus plays the part of the devil, who aspires to similar ends, it cannot help but profane sacred things by adulterating the Word's goods and truths. Consequently Babylon or Babel also symbolizes the profanation of what is sacred and the adulteration of the Word's goodness and truth.<p>These are the symbolic meanings of Babylon here in the book of Revelation, and of Babel in the following places in the prophetic and historical Word:<p>(Regarding) Babel... Behold, the day of Jehovah is coming, cruel...., ...the stars of heaven and their constellations do not give their light; the sun has been darkened in its rising, and the moon does not cause its light to shine....<p>"I will halt the arrogance of the proud, and will lay low the haughtiness of the violent...."<p>Babel, the glory of kingdoms..., will be as God's overthrowing of Sodom and Gomorrah... Ziyyim <sup>1</sup>will lie down there, their houses will be full of 'ochim, <sup>2</sup>and the offspring of owls will dwell there, and satyrs will caper there. 'Iyyim <sup>3</sup>will reply in her palaces, and dragons in her pleasant palaces.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 717</h4><p>717. THE SEVENTEENTH CHAPTER<p>1. And there came one of the seven angels having the seven phials, and spoke with me, saying to Me, Come, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot sitting upon many waters.<p>2. With whom the kings of the land have committed whoredom, and those inhabiting the land have been made drunk with the wine of her whoredom.<p>3. And he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.<p>4. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious Stone and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and the uncleanness of her whoredom.<p>5. And upon her forehead a name was written, Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of the whoredoms and abominations of the land.<p>6. And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus, and I wondered, seeing her with a great wonder.<p>7. And the angel said unto me, Why dost thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast carrying her, having the seven heads and ten horns.<p>8. The beast that thou hast seen was, and is not, and is going to come up out of the deep and go away into perdition. And those dwelling upon the land shall wonder, whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, seeing the beast that was and is not, but yet is.<p>9. This is the mind having wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, where the woman is sitting upon them.<p>10. And they are seven kings; five have fallen, and one is, another is not yet come, and when he comes he must remain a short while.<p>11. And the beast that was and is not, himself is the eighth, and is of the seven, and is going into perdition.<p>12. And the ten horns that thou hast seen are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings one hour with the beast.<p>13. These have one purpose (sententia), and shall surrender their power and authority to the beast.<p>14. These shall fight with the Lamb, but the Lamb shall overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and they who are with Him are called, chosen and faithful.<p>15. And he says unto me, The waters that thou hast seen, where the harlot is sitting, are peoples and crowds and nations and tongues.<p>16. And the ten horns that thou hast seen upon the beast these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and eat up her flesh, and burn her up with fire.<p>17. Forasmuch as God has put in their heart to do His purpose, and to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until God's words shall <sup>1</sup>be consummated.<p>18. And the woman whom thou hast seen is the great city, having a kingdom over the kings of the land.<p>THE SPIRITUAL SENSE<p>THE CONTENTS OF THE WHOLE CHAPTER<p>Concerning the Roman Catholic form of religion. There is described in what sort of way it had falsified the Word, and consequently perverted all the truths of the Church (verses 1-7): how it had falsified and perverted them with those who were subject to its dominion (verses 8-11): that [this had occurred] less with those who had not so subjected themselves to its dominion (verses 12-15).<p>Concerning the Reformed: that they had extricated themselves from the yoke of its domination (verses 16-17): concerning its domination still (verse 18).<p>THE CONTENTS OF EACH OF THE VERSES<p>1. And there came one of the seven angels having the seven phials, and spoke with me, signifies an influx and revelation now from the Lord out of the inmost of heaven concerning the Roman Catholic form of religion.<p>Saying unto me, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot sitting upon many waters, signifies a revelation concerning that form of religion as to its profanations and adulterations of the truth (veritas) of the Word.<p>2. With whom the kings of the land have committed whoredom, signifies that they have adulterated the truths and goods of the Church that are derived from the Word.<p>And those inhabiting the land have been made drunk with the wine of her whoredom, signifies the insaneness in spiritual things resulting from the adulteration of the Word with those who are in that form of religion.<p>3. And he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness, signifies carried away in a spiritual state to those with whom all things of the Church have been devastated.<p>And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, signifies that form of religion upon the Word profaned by them.<p>Having seven heads, and ten horns, signifies intelligence derived from the Word, in the beginning holy, afterwards none, and at last insanity, and continually much power derived from the Word.<p>4. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, signifies the celestial Divine Good and Divine Truth that are of the Word, with them.<p>And decked with gold and precious stone, signifies the spiritual Divine Good and Divine Truth that are of the Word, with them.<p>And pearls, signifies the cognitions of good and truth that are of the Word, with them.<p>Having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and the uncleanness of her whoredom, signifies that form of religion derived from the profaned holy things of the Word, and from its goods and truths defiled by means of dreadful untruths.<p>5. Upon her forehead written, Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of the whoredoms and abominations of the land, signifies what the Roman Catholic form of religion is like interiorly, which has been concealed: that as the result of its origin from the love of dominating out of the love of self over the holy things of the Church and over heaven thus over all things of the Lord and His Word, it has defiled and profaned the things that are of the Word and of the Church therefrom.<p>6. And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus, signifies that form of religion being insane as the result of the adulterated and profaned Divine Truths and Goods of the Lord, of the Word, and of the Church therefrom.<p>And I wondered, seeing her with a great wonder, signifies astonishment at that form of religion being such interiorly, when yet exteriorly it appears otherwise.<p>7. And the angel said unto me, Why dost thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast carrying her, having the seven heads and ten horns, signifies the disclosure: what the things that precede and were seen signify.<p>8. The beast that thou hast seen, was and is not, signifies the Word with them acknowledged as holy, and yet in reality not acknowledged.<p>And is going to come up out of the deep and go away into perdition, signifies [that it was] several times deliberated in the Papal Consistory concerning the reception and reading of the Word by the laity and common people, but it was rejected.<p>And those dwelling upon the land shall wonder, whose names have not been written in the Lamb's <sup>2</sup>book of life from the foundation of the world, seeing the beast that was and is not, but yet is, signifies the bewilderment of all those who are of that form of religion, who from its establishment have aimed at dominion over heaven and earth, that the Word, although thus rejected, is still in existence.<p>9. This is the mind having wisdom, signifies that this interpretation is in the natural sense but is for those who are in the spiritual sense from the Lord.<p>The seven heads are seven mountains, and the woman is sitting upon them, [10.] and they are seven kings, signifies the Divine Goods and Divine Truths of the Word upon which that form of religion has been founded, in time destroyed and finally profaned.<p>Five have fallen, and one is, and another is not yet come, and when he comes he must remain a short while, signifies that all the Divine Truths of the Word have been destroyed except this one, that to the Lord was given all authority in heaven and on earth; and except this other one, which has not yet come into question, [and is] not going to continue, which is, that the Lord's Human is Divine.<p>11. And the beast that was and is not, himself is the eighth, and is of the seven, and is going into perdition, signifies that the Word, concerning which [something was said] before, is Divine Good Itself, and that it is Divine Truth, and that it is being taken away from the laity and the common people lest the profanations and adulterations made there by the leaders should appear, and they [the laity and common people] should withdraw<p>12. And the ten horns <sup>3</sup>are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, signifies the Word as to the power derived from Divine Truths with those who are in the kingdom of France and are not in that manner under the yoke of the Papal dominion, with whom, however, there has not yet been formed a Church thus separated from the Roman Catholic form of religion.<p>But they receive authority as kings one hour with the beast, signifies that the Word has influence with them, and they have influence by means of the Word, as if they were in its Divine Truths.<p>13. These have one purpose, and shall surrender their power and authority to the beast, signifies that they unanimously acknowledge that government and dominion over the Church is solely by means of the Word.<p>14. These shall fight with the Lamb, but the Lamb shall overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings, signifies the Lord's fight with them about the acknowledgment of His Divine Human, because the Lord in that [Human] is the God of heaven and earth, and also is the Word.<p>And they who are with Him are called, chosen and faithful, signifies that those who approach and worship the Lord Only are the ones who come into heaven, both those who are in the external things of the Church and those who are in the internal and inmost things thereof.<p>15. And He says unto me, The waters that thou hast seen, where the harlot is sitting, are peoples and crowds, and nations and tongues, signifies that under the Papal dominion, but in the truths of the Word variously adulterated and profaned by that form of religion, there are those who belong thereto as the result of diversity in doctrine and discipline, and in religion and confession.<p>16. And the ten horns that thou hast seen upon the beast, these shall hate the harlot, signifies the Word as to its power derived from Divine Truths with the Protestants, who have altogether cast off from themselves the yoke of Papal dominion.<p>And shall make her desolate and naked, signifies that they will divest themselves of its untruths and evils.<p>And shall eat up her flesh, and burn her up with fire, signifies that out of hatred they will condemn and destroy with themselves the evils and untruths that are proper to that form of religion, and execrate and blot out with themselves the form of religion itself.<p>17. Forasmuch as God has put in their heart to do His purpose, and to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, signifies the judgment with them from the Lord, that they should altogether repudiate and execrate the Roman Catholic form of religion, and should blot it out and uproot it among themselves, and the unanimous judgment that they should acknowledge the Word and found the Church upon it.<p>Until God's words shall <sup>4</sup>be consummated, signifies until all the things that have been foretold concerning them have been fulfilled.<p>18. And the woman whom thou hast seen is the great city having a kingdom over the kings of the land, signifies that as to doctrine the Roman Catholic form of religion reigns in Christendom, and to some extent even still with the Reformed although they are not under the Papal dominion.<p>THE EXPOSITION <sup>5</sup><p>In the things preceding from chapter 7 to chapter 16 inclusive [the Word] has treated of the Reformed. Now in this and the following chapter it treats of the followers of the Pontiff (Pontificii), among whom those who have claimed for themselves the power of opening and shutting heaven are understood by 'Babylon.' Here therefore it shall first be said what specifically is understood by 'Babylon.' By 'Babylon' or 'Babel' is understood the love, derived from the love of self, of dominating over the holy things of the Church; and because that love mounts up so far as it has free rein, and the holy things of the Church are also the holy things of heaven, therefore by 'Babylon' or 'Babel' is also signified dominion over heaven. And because that love actuates the devil, who aims at similar things, he cannot but profane holy things by adulterating the goods and truths of the Word. Therefore by 'Babylon' or 'Babel' is signified also the profanation of holy things, and the adulteration of the good and truth of the Word. These are the things that are signified by 'Babylon' here in the Apocalypse, and by 'Babel' in the prophetical and historical Word, in these passages:<p>Concerning Babel: Behold the day of Jehovah is coming, cruel. The stars of the heavens and the constellations thereof shall not shine with their light (lux); the sun has been darkened in his rising, and the moon is not causing her light (lumen) to gleam. I will cause the elation of the proud to cease, and will lay low the pride of the violent. Babel, the ornament of kingdoms, shall be as God's overthrowing Sodom and Gomorrah. Ziim <sup>6</sup>shall lie down there, their houses shall be filled with ochim, and the daughters of the owl shall dwell there, and satyrs shall prance there, ijim shall answer in her palaces, and dragons in the palaces of her delights. <a href="3927/isaiah_13_1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">9-11</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_21.htm">21-22</a>; besides many other things in the whole of that chapter.<p>Thou shalt declare this parable concerning the king of Babel: Thy magnificence has been sent down into hell. Thou hast fallen down from heaven, O Lucifer; thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend the heavens, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God, I will ascend above the heights of the cloud, I will become like the Most High. But yet thou hast been sent down into hell. I will arise against thee, <sup>7</sup>and cut off from Babel the name and the remnant. <a href="3927/isaiah_14_4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_14_11.htm">11-15</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_14_22.htm">22</a>;<p>Jehovah has spoken against Babel: Your mother was ashamed exceedingly, she who bare you (genetrix vestra) was suffused with shame; behold the last [of the nations is] a wilderness, a drought and a solitude. Arrange yourselves against Babel round about, shoot the javelin against her, and do not spare the arrows. How Babel has been brought into desolation among the nations! she has acted insolently against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel. A drought is upon her waters, that they may dry up, for it is a land of graven images, and it glories in horrible things; therefore ziim shall dwell there with ijim, and owls shall dwell therein, according to God's overthrowing Sodom and Gomorrah. <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_1.htm">Jeremiah 50:1</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_23.htm">23</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_29.htm">29</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_38.htm">38-40</a>; besides many other things concerning 'Babel' in the whole of that chapter.<p>Babel is a goblet of gold in the hand of Jehovah, making the entire land drunken. The nations have drunk of her wine, therefore they are mad. Forsake her, for her judgment has reached to the heavens, and has lifted itself up even to the clouds. Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, destroying the entire land. I will roll thee down from the rocks, and I will turn thee into a mountain of burning. I will visit upon Bel in Babel; and I will draw forth his mouthful out of his mouth, that the nations may no longer flow together unto him; even the wall of Babel shall collapse. Behold the coming days in which I shall visit upon the graven images of Babel, that her whole land may be ashamed. Though Babel should ascend into the heavens, and though she should fortify the highplace of her strength, from Me shall wasters come. Yea, I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, and her guides and her leading men, that they may sleep the sleep of an age and not awake. <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_25.htm">25</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_44.htm">44</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_47.htm">47</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_53.htm">53</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_57.htm">57</a>; besides many other things in the whole of that chapter concerning 'Babel.'<p>Come down and sit upon the dust, O virgin daughter of Babel, sit on the ground; there is no throne. Take a mill-stone and grind meal; uncover the thigh, pass over rivers, thy nakedness shall be uncovered, thy disgrace shall be seen. Thou hast said, I shall be mistress to eternity; thou hast not remembered the end. Thou hast trusted in thy wickedness; thou hast said, [There is] no seeing me; thy wisdom and thy knowledge has led thee astray, while thou hast said in thy heart, I, and there is none else like me; devastation shall come suddenly, thou shalt not know. Stand fast in thy enchantments, in the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth. Perchance they can be of some use, perchance thou shalt become terrible. <a href="3927/isaiah_47_1.htm">Isaiah 47:1-3</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_47_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_47_10.htm">10-12</a>; besides more concerning' Babel' in that chapter. Similar things are signified by:<p>The city and the tower, whose top [was to be] in heaven, which those coming out of the east attempted to build in the valley of Shinar whose lip Jehovah going down out of heaven confounded, whence the name of the place [was] Babel (confusion). <a href="3927/genesis_11_1.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>.<p>Similar things are signified by the following passages in Daniel:<p>By the statue seen by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, the feet of which were partly iron and partly clay, which the stone cut out not by hand smote and ground to pieces, and all of the statue became as chaff on threshing-floors; and the stone was made into a great rock. <a href="3927/daniel_2_31.htm">Daniel 2:31-47</a>.<p>By the great statue which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel made, and commanded that they should fall down and adore before it, and that those who would not do so should be cast into the furnace of fire. <a href="3927/daniel_3_1.htm">Daniel 3:1-7</a> seq.<p>By the tree growing until its height should reach to heaven, and the sight of it to the end of the land, which the Watcher and Holy One coming down out of heaven commanded to be hewed down, lopped, broken up, and scattered about: and because the king of Babel was represented thereby, it came to pass that he was driven away from man, was dwelling with the beasts, and eating grass like an ox. <a href="3927/daniel_4_1.htm">Daniel 4:1</a> to the end.<p>By the fact that Belshazzar king of Babel with his nobles, wives and concubines, was drinking wine out of the vessels of gold and silver of the Jerusalem temple, and was praising gods of gold, silver, bronze, iron and stone; on account of which the wall was written on, and the king himself was slain on the same day <a href="3927/daniel_5_1.htm">Daniel 5</a> to the end. By the decree of Darius the Mede, king of Babel, that no one within the space of 30 days should ask anything from God or man, but from the king only: if otherwise, he should be cast into the den of lions. <a href="3927/daniel_6_7.htm">Daniel 6:7</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/daniel_6_8.htm">8</a>] to the end.<p>And by the four beasts coming up out of the sea seen by Daniel, the fourth of which [was] terrible, strong, having great teeth of iron, it devoured and crushed in pieces, and trampled the residue with its feet. And that then the judgment was set, and the books were opened, and the beast was slain and consigned to be burnt by fire. And that then there was seen coming with the clouds of heaven One like the Son of Man, to Whom was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, and all peoples and nations and tongues shall worship Him; His dominion is the dominion of an age that shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not perish. <a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-14</a> seq.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Reading consummentur (shall be consummated) as in <a href="750.htm">750</a>, instead of consummarentur (should be consummated).<p>2.&nbsp;The Original Edition has Agni (the Lamb's or of the Lamb) here, but it is not found in the text of the chapter nor at <a href="735.htm">735</a>.<p>3.&nbsp;The Original Edition omits 'that thou hast seen' here and at <a href="740.htm">740</a>.<p>4.&nbsp;See footnote to verse 17.<br><br>5.&nbsp;In the Original Edition the whole of this paragraph is marked with quotation marks.<br><br>6.&nbsp;Reading ziim as in Hebrew instead of jiim.<br><br>7.&nbsp;Hebrew has 'them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 717</h4><p>717. Revelation 17<p>1.

With whom the kings of the earth have committed whoredom, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her whoredom.<p>3.

And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and inwrought with gold, and precious stones, and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and uncleanness of her whoredom.<p>5. And upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of whoredoms and abominations of the earth.<p>6. And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus; and when I saw her, I wondered with great wonder.<p>7.

"Having seven heads and ten horns," signifies intelligence from the Word, holy at the beginning, afterwards none, and at length insanity, and much power from the Word continually, (<a href="724.htm">724</a>).<p>Verse 4. "And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet," signifies the celestial Divine good and Divine truth, which are of the Word, among them, (<a href="725.htm">725</a>). "And inwrought with gold and precious stones," signifies spiritual Divine good and Divine truth, which are of the Word, with them, (<a href="726.htm">726</a>). "And pearls," signifies the knowledges of good and truth, which are of the Word, with them, (<a href="727.htm">727</a>). "Having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and uncleanness of her whoredom," signifies that religion from the holy things of the Word profaned, and from its goods and truths defiled by direful falsities, (<a href="728.htm">728</a>).<p>Verse 5. "Upon her forehead <sup>1</sup>written, Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of whoredoms and abominations of the earth," signifies the Roman Catholic religion, as to its interior quality, which is concealed, that from its origin, from the love of dominating, from the love of self over the holy things of the church and over heaven, and thus over all things of the Lord and His Word, it has defiled and profaned the things which are of the Word and thence of the church, (<a href="729.htm">729</a>).<p>Verse 6. "And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus," signifies that religion insane from adulterated and profaned Divine truths and goods of the Lord, of the Word, and thence of the church, (<a href="730.htm">730</a>). "And when I saw her I wondered with great wonder," signifies astonishment that that religion is such interiorly, when yet it appears otherwise exteriorly, (<a href="731.htm">731</a>).<p>Verse 7. "And the angel said unto me, Wherefore dost thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns," signifies the disclosure of what the things which precede and were seen signify, (<a href="732.htm">732</a>).<p>Verse 8. "The beast which thou sawest was, and is not," signifies the Word acknowledged as holy with them, and yet really not acknowledged, (<a href="733.htm">733</a>). "And is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into perdition," signifies deliberation at different times in the Papal Consistory respecting the reception and reading of the Word by the laity and the common people, but rejected, (<a href="734.htm">734</a>). "And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the Lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world, seeing the beast which was, and is not, and yet is," signifies the amazement of those who are of that religion, all who from its establishment have aimed at dominion over heaven and earth, that the Word, although thus rejected, still is, (<a href="735.htm">735</a>).<p>Verse 9. "This is the mind that hath wisdom," signifies that this is the interpretation in the natural sense, but for those who are in the spiritual sense from the Lord, (<a href="736.htm">736</a>). "The seven heads are seven mountains, where the woman sitteth upon them (verse <a href="3927/revelation_17_10.htm">10</a>): and they are seven kings," signifies the Divine goods and Divine truths of the Word, upon which that religion is founded, destroyed in time, and at length profaned, (<a href="737.htm">737</a>). "Five have fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he is come, he must remain a short time," signifies that all the Divine truths of the Word have been destroyed except this one, that all the power in heaven and in earth was given to the Lord; and except another, which has not yet come into question, but will not remain, which is, that the Lord's Human is Divine, (<a href="738.htm">738</a>).<p>Verse 11. "And the beast, that was, and is not, is himself the eighth, and is of the seven, and he goeth into perdition," signifies that the Word, as explained above, is the Divine good itself, and that it is the Divine truth; and that it is taken away from the laity and the common people, lest the profanations and adulterations made in it by their leaders should appear, and they should on that account recede, (<a href="739.htm">739</a>).<p>Verse 12. "And the ten horns <sup>2</sup>are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom," signifies the Word as to power from Divine truths with those who are in the kingdom of France, and are not so much under the yoke of the Papal dominion; with whom however there has not yet been formed a church fully separated from the Roman Catholic religion, (<a href="740.htm">740</a>). "But they receive authority as kings one hour with the beast," signifies that the Word has power with them, and they by the Word are as if they were in its Divine truths, (<a href="741.htm">741</a>).<p>Verse 13. "These have one mind, and they shall give their power and authority to the beast," signifies that they acknowledge unanimously that government and dominion over the church are solely through the Word, (<a href="742.htm">742</a>).<p>Verse 14. "These shall fight with the Lamb, but the Lamb shall overcome them; for He is the Lord of lords and King of kings," signifies the Lord's combat with them concerning the acknowledgment of His Divine Human, because in it the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and is also the Word, (<a href="743.htm">743</a>). "And they who are with Him are called, chosen, and faithful," signifies that they who approach and worship the Lord alone are they that come into heaven, as well they who are in the externals of the church as they that are in its internals and inmosts, (<a href="744.htm">744</a>[1-2]). Verse 15. "And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples and multitudes, and nations and tongues," signifies that they are under the Papal dominion, but in the truths of the Word variously adulterated and profaned by that religion, who are of its varieties of doctrine and discipline, and its varieties of religion and confession, (<a href="745.htm">745</a>).<p>Verse 16. "And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the harlot," signifies the Word as to power from Divine truths with the Protestants, who have altogether cast off from themselves the yoke of the Papal dominion, (<a href="746.htm">746</a>). "And shall make her desolate and naked," signifies that they will put off from themselves its falsities and evils, (<a href="747.htm">747</a>). "And shall eat her flesh, and burn her up with fire," signifies that from hatred they will condemn and destroy from among themselves the evils and falsities which are proper to that religion, and will hold that religion itself accursed, and will blot it out from among them, (<a href="748.htm">748</a>).<p>Verse 17. "For God gave into their hearts to do His mind, and to do one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast," signifies judgment with them from the Lord, that they should altogether repudiate and hold accursed the Roman Catholic religion, and should destroy and root it out from among themselves; and the unanimous judgment, that they should acknowledge the Word, and should found the church upon it, (<a href="749.htm">749</a>). "Until the words of God should be consummated," signifies until all the things which have been foretold concerning them shall be fulfilled, (<a href="750.htm">750</a>).<p>Verse 18. "And the woman whom thou sawest is the great city that hath a kingdom over the kings of the earth," signifies that the Roman Catholic religion reigns as to doctrine in the Christian world, and also still in some measure among the Reformed, although they are not under the Papal dominion.<p>THE EXPLANATION<p>Verse 1. What goes before, from chapter 7 to chapter 16, inclusive, treats of the Reformed; this chapter and the next treat of the Papists, among whom they who have claimed to themselves the power of opening and shutting heaven are meant by "Babylon." Here therefore it shall first be said what is specifically meant by "Babylon." By "Babylon" or "Babel" is meant the love of dominion over the holy things of the church from self-love, and because that love ascends in proportion as the reins are relaxed to it, and as the holy things of the church are also the holy things of heaven, therefore by "Babylon" or "Babel" is also signified dominion over heaven. And because this love thus acts the part of the devil, because it aspires to the same things, it cannot do otherwise than profane things holy, by adulterating the goods and truths of the Word, therefore by "Babylon" or "Babel" is also signified the profanation of what is holy, and the adulteration of the good and truth of the Word. Such is the signification of "Babylon" here in Revelation, and of "Babel" in the prophetic and historical Word, in these passages:<p>Concerning Babel: Behold the day of Jehovah cometh cruel; the stars of the heavens and the constellations thereof shall not shine with their light; the sun is darkened in his rising, and the moon shall not cause her light [lumen] to shine. I will cause the exaltation of the proud to cease, and I will humble the pride of the violent. Babel, the ornament of kingdoms, shall be as God's overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah; the tziim shall lie there, their houses shall be filled with the ochim, and the daughters of the owl shall dwell there, and the satyrs shall dance there; the ijim shall answer in her palaces, and the dragons in the palaces of her delights, (<a href="3927/isaiah_13_1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">9-11</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_21.htm">21-22</a>).<p>Besides many other things in the whole of the chapter.<p>Thou shalt declare this parable concerning the king of Babel: Thy magnificence is brought down into hell; thou hast fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend the heavens, above the stars of God I will exalt my throne, I will ascend above the heights of the cloud, I will become like the Most High; but yet thou shalt be brought down to hell; I will rise against thee, <sup>3</sup>and will cut off from Babel the name and residue, (<a href="3927/isaiah_14_4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_14_11.htm">11-15</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_14_22.htm">22</a>).<p>Besides more things in the whole chapter.<p>Jehovah hath spoken against Babel: Your mother was exceedingly ashamed, she that brought you forth was suffused with shame; behold, the last end shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. Set yourselves in array against Babel round about, shoot against her, spare no arrows; how is Babel become a desolation among the nations! She acted insolently against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel. A drought is upon her waters, that they may dry up, because it is a land of graven images, and it glories in horrible things; therefore the ziim shall dwell there with the ijim, and the owls shall dwell therein, as God's overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_1.htm">Jeremiah 50:1</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_12.htm">12</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_23.htm">23</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_29.htm">29</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_38.htm">38-40</a>).<p>Besides many other things concerning "Babel" in that whole chapter.<p>Babel is a cup of gold in the hand of Jehovah, making the whole earth drunken; the nations have drunk of her wine, therefore they are mad; forsake her, for her judgment hath reached to the heavens, and hath lifted itself up even to the clouds; behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, that destroyest the whole earth. I will roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a mountain of burning. I will visit upon Bel in Babel; I will bring forth his morsel out of his mouth, that the nations may no longer flow together unto him; yea the wall of Babel shall fall. Behold the days are coming, in which I will visit upon the graven images of Babel, that her whole land may be ashamed. Though Babel should ascend into the heavens, and though she should fortify the high places of her strength, from Me shall wasters come. Yea, I will make drunk her princes and her wise ones, and her leaders, and her primates, that they may sleep the sleep of an age, and not awake, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_1.htm">Jeremiah 51:1</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_25.htm">25</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_44.htm">44</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_47.htm">47</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_53.htm">53</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_57.htm">57</a>).<p>Besides many other things concerning "Babel" in that whole chapter.<p>Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babel, sit on the earth; there is no throne; take the millstones and grind meal; uncover the thigh, pass over the streams, thy nakedness shall be uncovered, thy disgrace shall be seen. Thou hast said, I shall be mistress to eternity; thou didst not remember the end; thou hast trusted in thy wickedness; thou hast said, No one seeth me; thy wisdom and thy knowledge hath seduced thee, when thou saidst in thy heart, I, and there is none else like me; devastation shall come suddenly, thou shalt not know; persist in thy enchantments, in the multitude of thy sorceries, in which thou hast labored from thy youth, peradventure they will be able to profit, peradventure thou shalt become terrible, (<a href="3927/isaiah_47_1.htm">Isaiah 47:1-3</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_47_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_47_10.htm">10-12</a>).<p>Besides other things concerning "Babel" in that chapter. Similar things are signified by:<p>The city and tower whose head was in heaven, which they that came from the east attempted to build in the valley of Shinar, whose speech Jehovah descending from heaven confounded; whence the name of the place was called "Babel" [confusion] (<a href="3927/genesis_11_1.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>).<p>Similar things are signified by the following passages in Daniel:<p>By the statue seen by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, the feet of which were partly iron and partly clay, which the stone cut out not by a hand smote and ground to pieces, and all the parts of the statue became as the chaff in the threshing floors; and the stone became a great rock, (<a href="3927/daniel_2_31.htm">Daniel 2:31-47</a>).<p>By the great image which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel made, and commanded that they should fall down and adore before it; and that they who would not should be cast into the furnace of fire, (<a href="3927/daniel_3_1.htm">Daniel 3:1-7</a>).<p>By the tree that grew until its height reached unto heaven, and the sight of it unto the end of the earth, which a watcher and a holy one, coming down from heaven, commanded to hew down, to cut off, to strip off, and to scatter; and because the king of Babel was represented by it, it came to pass that he was driven away from man, dwelt with the beasts, and ate the herbage like an ox, (<a href="3927/daniel_4_1.htm">Daniel 4</a>).<p>By Belshazzar king of Babel drinking wine with his nobles, wives, and concubines, out of the vessels of gold and silver of the temple of Jerusalem, and praising the gods of gold, silver, brass, iron, and stone; on account of which there was a writing on the wall, and the king himself was slain the same day, (<a href="3927/daniel_5_1.htm">Daniel 5</a>).<p>By the decree of Darius the Mede, king of Babel; that no one for thirty days should seek anything from God or man, but from the king alone; if otherwise, he should be cast into the den of lions, (<a href="3927/daniel_6_8.htm">Daniel 6:8-28</a>).<p>And by the four beasts seen by Daniel to come up out of the sea, of which the fourth, terrible, strong, having great teeth of iron, it devoured and crushed in pieces, and trampled the residue with his feet; and that then the judgment was set, and the books were opened, and the beast was slain, and given into the burning of fire; and that then there was seen coming with the clouds of heaven one like the Son of man, to whom was given dominion and glory and the kingdom, and all peoples, and nations and tongues shall worship Him; His dominion is the dominion of an age which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not perish, (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-14</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original Latin omits "name."<br><br>2.&nbsp;The original Latin omits "which thou sawest."<br><br>1.&nbsp;The Hebrew has "them." </p>

CAPUT XVII. <p>ET venit unus ex septem Angelis habentibus Septem phialas, et locutus cum me, dicens mihi, Veni, ostendam tibi judicium Meretricis magnae Sedentis super aquis multis; <p>2. Cum qua scortati sunt Reges terrae, et inebriati sunt ex vino scortationis ejus inhabitantes terram. <p>3. Et detulit me in desertum in spiritu, et vidi Mulierem Sedentem super Bestia coccinea, plena nominibus blasphemiae, habente Capita septem, et cornua decem. <p>4. Et Mulier circuminduta purpura et coccino, et inaurata auro et lapide pretioso et margaritis, habens aureum poculum in manu sua, plenum abominationibus et immunditie scortationis ejus. <p>5. Et super fronte ejus nomen scriptum, Mysterium, Babylon magna, mater scortationum et abominationum terrae. <p>6. Et vidi Mulierem inebriatam ex sanguine sanctorum, et ex sanguine testium Jesu, et admiratus sum videns illam, admiratione magna. <p>7. Et dixit mihi Angelus, Quare admiraris? ego tibi dicam mysterium Mulieris, et Bestiae portantis illam, habentis septem Capita et decem Cornua. <p>8. Bestia, quam vidisti, erat et non est, et futura est ascendere ex abysso, et in interitum abire: et mirabuntur habitantes Super terra, quorum non scripta nomina in Libro vitae a fundatione mundi, videntes Bestiam, quae erat et non est, attamen est. <p>9. Haec mens habens Sapientiam: septem Capita Montes sunt Septem ubi Mulier sedet super illis. <p>10. Et Reges septem Sunt; quinque ceciderunt, et unus est, alter nondum Venit; et quando venerit, brevi illum oportet manere. <p>11. Et Bestia, quae erat et non est, ipsa octavus est, de Septem est, et in interitum abit. <p>12. Et decem Cornua, quae vidisti, decem Reges sunt, qui regnum nondum acceperunt, sed potestatem tanquam Reges unam horam accipiunt cum Bestia. <p>13. Hi unam Sententiam habent, et potentiam et potestatem suam Bestiae tradent. <p>14. Hi cum Agno pugnabunt, Sed Agnus Vincet illos, quia Dominus dominorum est et Rex regum; et qui cum Ipso, vocati, electi et fideles. <p>15. Et dicit mihi, Aquae quas vidisti, ubi Meretrix sedet, populi et turbae Sunt, et gentes et linguae. <p>16. Et decem Cornua quae vidisti super Bestia, hi odio habebunt Meretricem, et desolatam facient illam, et nudam, et carnes ejus comedent, et illam comburent Igne. <p>17. Quoniam Deus dedit in corda illorum facere sententiam ejus, et facere unam sententiam, et dare regnum suum Bestiae, donec consummentur <sup>1</sup>verba Dei. <p>18. Et Mulier, quam vidisti, est urbs magna, habens regnum Super Reges terrae. <p>SENSUS SPIRITUALIS. <p>CONTENTUM TOTIUS CAPITIS. <p>DE RELIGIOSO ROMANO CATHOLICO: <p>DESCRIBITUR QUALITER FALSIFICAVERAT VERBUM, ET INDE OMNIA VERA ECCLESIAE PERVERTERAT (vers. 1-7);<p>QUOMODO ILLA FALSIFICAVERAT ET PERVERTERAT APUD ILLOS QUI DOMINIO EJUS SUBJECTI SUNT (vers. 8-11);<p>QUOD MINUS APUD ILLOS QUI NON ITA DOMINIO EJUS SE SUBJECERANT (vers. 12-15).<p>DE REFORMATIS: <p>QUOD SE JUGO DOMINATIONIS EJUS SUBTRAXERINT (vers. 16, 17);<p>DE DOMINATIONE EJUS USQUE (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_717/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_18" target=_top>18</a>).<p>CONTENTA SINGULORUM VERSUUM. <p>1.

Hic itaque primum dicetur quid in specie per "Babyloniam" intelligitur. Per "Babyloniam" seu "Babelem" intelligitur Amor dominandi super sancta Ecclesiae ex amore sui; et quia ille amor scandit quousque laxatur ei frenum, et sancta Ecclesiae etiam sunt sancta Caeli, ideo per "Babyloniam" seu "Babelem' etiam significatur Dominium super Caelum. Et quia illi amor sic agit Diabolum, qui similia affectat, ille non potest aliter quam prophanare sancta, adulterando bona et vera Verbi; ideo per "Babyloniam" seu "Babelem" etiam significatur Prophanatio sancti, ac Adulteratio boni et veri Verbi. Haec sunt quae significantur per "Babyloniam" hic in Apocalypsi, et per "Babelem" in Verbo Prophetico et Historico, in his locis: <p>De Babele: "Ecce dies Jehovae venit crudelis: stellae caelorum et sidera illorum non lucent luce sua; obtenebratus est Sol in ortu suo, et Luna non splendere facit lumen suum.
