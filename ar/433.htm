<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>433.“脸面好像男人的脸面”表他们在自己看来像是有智慧的。在圣言中，“男人”表示智慧和聪明人（<a href="243.htm">243</a>节）；他的“脸面”表示智慧和聪明；正因如此，“脸面好像男人的脸面”表示他们在自己看来像是有智慧的。他们也被称为有智慧、学识、博学的，尽管他们就在灯中无油的愚拙童女之列（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.1.htm">25:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.3.htm">3</a>）。“油”表示爱与仁；那些听到主的话，也就是读了圣言却不遵行的人就在“愚蠢的人”之列（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.26.htm">7:26</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 433</h4><p>433. And their faces were like the faces of men. This symbolically means that they seemed to themselves to be wise.<p>A human being in the Word symbolizes someone who is wise and intelligent (no. <a href="243.htm">243</a>), and his face symbolizes wisdom and intelligence. It is because of this that the locusts' faces being like the faces of men means, symbolically, that they seemed to themselves to be wise. They are also called wise, educated and learned, even though they are among the "foolish virgins" who had no oil in their lamps (<a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1-3</a>). Oil symbolizes love and charity. They are also among the foolish who hear what the Lord says, that is, who read the Word, and do not do it (<a href="3927/matthew_7_26.htm">Matthew 7:26</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 433</h4><p>433. 'And their faces were as the faces of men' signifies that they appeared to themselves as if wise. By 'a man' in the Word is signified one who is wise and intelligent (<a href="243.htm">243</a>), and wisdom and intelligence is signified by his face. This is why by 'their faces were as the faces of men' is signified that they appeared to themselves as if wise. They are also called wise, learned and well-informed, although they are among the foolish virgins, who had no oil in the lamps (<a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1-2</a>). 'Oil' signifies love and charity, and [they are] among the foolish, who hear the Lord, that is, read the Word, and do it not (<a href="3927/matthew_7_26.htm">Matthew 7:26</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 433</h4><p>433. And their faces were as the faces of men, signifies that they appeared to themselves to be wise. By "man," in the Word, is signified one wise and intelligent, (<a href="243.htm">243</a>); and by his "face," wisdom and intelligence; hence it is, that by "their faces as the faces of men," is signified that they appeared to themselves to be wise. They are also called wise, learned, and erudite, although they are among the foolish virgins, who had no oil in their lamps, (<a href="3927/matthew_25_1.htm">Matthew 25:1-2</a>). "Oil" signifies love and charity; and among the foolish means among those who hear the Lord, that is, read the Word, and do not do it, (<a href="3927/matthew_7_26.htm">Matthew 7:26</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 433 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>433. "Et facies illarum sicut facies hominum," significat quod apparerent sibi sicut sapientes. - Per "hominem" in Verbo significatur sapiens et intelligens (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_433/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_243" target=_top>243</a>), et per "faciem" ejus sapientia et intelligentia; inde est, quod per "facies illarum sicut facies hominum" significetur quod apparerent sibi sicut sapientes; vocantur quoque sapientes, docti et eruditi, tametsi sunt inter virgines stultas, quae non habebant oleum in lampadibus, (Matthew 45:1, Matthew 45:2(, Matthew 45:3)); "oleum" significat amorem et charitatem et inter stultos, qui audiunt Dominum, hoc est, legunt Verbum, et non faciunt illud, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_433/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_7_26" target=_top>Matthaeus 7:26</a>). </p>
