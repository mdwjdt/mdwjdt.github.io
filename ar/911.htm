<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第911节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>911.启21:18.“墙的构造是碧玉的”表对新教会的人来说，圣言字义中的一切神性真理因灵义中的神性真理而透明。“墙”表示字义中的圣言（<a href="898.htm">898</a>节）；“构造”表示它的全部，因为它的全部都在构造中。“碧玉”与总体上的“宝石”所表相同，而“宝石”在论及圣言时，表示圣言字义中的神性真理因灵义中的神性真理而透明（<a href="231.htm">231</a>，<a href="540.htm">540</a>，<a href="726.htm">726</a>，<a href="823.htm">823</a>节）；“碧玉”所表相同（<a href="897.htm">897</a>节）。神性真理之所以透明，是因为字义中的神性真理处于属世之光，灵义中的神性真理处于属灵之光；所以当属灵之光流入正在读圣言之人里面的属世之光时，此人就会被启示，看到那里的真理；事实上，属灵之光的物体就是真理。字义中的圣言还具有这样的性质：人越被天堂之光的流注所启示，就越看到更多在自己的联系，因而自己形式中的真理；越看到它们，其理性心智就越从内在被打开，因为理性正是天堂之光的容器。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 911</h4><p>911. <a href="3927/revelation_21_18.htm">21:18</a> The construction of its wall was of jasper. This symbolically means that with people of the New Church the Divine truth of the Word in its spiritual sense shines through every Divine truth in the literal sense.<p>The wall symbolizes the Word in its literal sense (no. <a href="898.htm">898</a>). Its structure symbolizes everything in it, because everything in it is in its structure. Jasper has, on the whole, the same symbolic meaning as any precious stone, and in application to the Word a precious stone symbolizes the Divine truth of the Word in its literal sense through which the Divine truth in its spiritual sense shines through (nos. <a href="231.htm">231</a>, <a href="540.htm">540</a>, <a href="726.htm">726</a>, <a href="823.htm">823</a>). That jasper has the same symbolic meaning may be seen in no. <a href="897.htm">897</a> above.<p>The Divine truth shines through because Divine truth in the literal sense is seen in natural light, whereas Divine truth in the spiritual sense is seen in spiritual light. Consequently, when spiritual light flows into the natural sight in a person who is reading the Word, it enlightens him and he sees truths in it, for the objects of spiritual light are truths. The Word in its literal sense is also such that the more enlightened a person is by the influx of the light of heaven, the more truths he sees because of their connection and consequent form; and the more truths he sees in this way, the more interiorly is his rationality opened. For the rational faculty is the indispensable receptacle of heavenly light. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 911</h4><p>911. [verse 18] 'And the construction of the wall was of jasper' signifies that every Divine Truth of the Word in the sense of the letter with the men of that Church is transparent by virtue of the Divine Truth in the spiritual sense. By 'the wall' is signified the Word in the sense of the letter (<a href="898.htm">898</a>). By 'the construction' is signified everything of it, because everything of it is in the construction. By 'jasper' is signified much the same as by 'a precious stone' on the whole, and by 'a precious stone' when said of the Word is signified the Divine Truth of the Word in the sense of the letter transparent by virtue of the Divine Truth in the spiritual sense (<a href="231.htm">231</a>, <a href="540.htm">540</a>, <a href="726.htm">726</a>, <a href="823.htm">823</a>). That much the same is signified by 'jasper' may be seen above (<a href="897.htm">897</a>). The reason why it is transparent is because Divine Truth in the sense of the letter is in natural light and Divine Truth in the spiritual sense is in spiritual light, and therefore when spiritual light inflows into the natural light with a man who is reading the Word, he is enlightened and sees the truths there, for the objects of spiritual light are truths. Indeed the Word in the sense of the letter is such that the more a man is enlightened by means of an influx of the light of heaven the more he sees truths by virtue of their connection and resultant form, and the more he so sees them the more interiorly is his rational opened, for the rational is the very receptacle of the light of heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 911</h4><p>911. Verse 18. And the structure of the wall thereof was of jasper, signifies that every Divine truth in the sense of the letter of the Word with the men of that church is translucent from the Divine truth in the spiritual sense. By "a wall" is signified the Word in the sense of the letter, (<a href="898.htm">898</a>); by its "structure" is signified the all of it, because the all of it is in the structure. By "jasper" the same is signified as by "precious stone" in general, and by "precious stone," in reference to the Word, is signified Divine truth in the sense of the letter of the Word translucent from the Divine truth in the spiritual sense, (<a href="231.htm">231</a>, <a href="540.htm">540</a>, <a href="726.htm">726</a>, <a href="823.htm">823</a>); that the same is signified by "jasper," may be seen above, (<a href="897.htm">897</a>). The reason why it is translucent, is, because the Divine truth, in the sense of the letter is in natural light, and the Divine truth, in the spiritual sense is in spiritual light, wherefore when spiritual light flows into natural light with a man who is reading the Word, he is enlightened, and sees truths there, for the objects of spiritual light are truths. The Word also in the sense of the letter is of such a nature that the more a man is enlightened by the influx of the light of heaven, so much the more does he see truths in their connection and thence in their form; and the more he so sees them, so much the more interiorly is his rational mind opened, for the rational is the very receptacle of the light of heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 911 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>911. (Vers. 18) "Et erat structura muri ejus jaspis," significat quod omne Divinum Verum Verbi in Sensu literae apud homines istius Ecclesiae transluceat ex Divino Vero in Sensu spirituali. -Per "murum" significatur Verbum in Sensu literae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_911/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_898" target=_top>898</a>); per "structuram" ejus significatur omne ejus, quia omne ejus est in structura; per "jaspidem" significatur simile quod per "lapidem pretiosum" in summa, et per "lapidem pretiosum," cum de Verbo, significatur Divinum Verum Verbi in Sensu literae translucens ex Divino Vero in Sensu spirituali (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_911/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_231" target=_top>231</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_911/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_540" target=_top>540</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_911/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_726" target=_top>726</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_911/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_823" target=_top>823</a>); quod simile per "jaspidem," videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_911/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_897" target=_top>897</a>). Quod transluceat, est quia Divinum Verum in Sensu literae est in luce naturali, et Divinum verum in Sensu spirituali est in luce spirituali; quare cum lux spiritualis influit in lucem naturalem apud hominem qui legit Verbum, illustratur ille, et videt vera ibi, nam objecta lucis spiritualis sunt vera. Verbum etiam in Sensu literae tale est, ut quo plus homo illustratur per influxum lucis Caeli, eo plus videat vera ex nexu et inde forma illorum; et quo plus ita videt illa, eo interius aperitur rationale ejus, nam rationale est ipsum receptaculum lucis Caeli. </p>
