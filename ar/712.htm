<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第712节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>712.启16:19.“那大城裂为三段，列族的城也都倒塌了”表因着这些事，该教会在教义上被完全毁灭了，因而它所发出的一切异端邪说也被完全毁灭了。“城”表示教会的教义，或也可说，表示教义方面的教会（参看<a href="194.htm">194</a>，<a href="501.htm">501</a>，<a href="502.htm">502</a>节）；因此，“列族的城”表示它所发出的众多异端教义或异端邪说。“裂为三段”表示完全被毁灭；在圣言中，“裂开”表示被驱散，因为在这种情况下，它们不连贯，“三”表示全部和整体（<a href="400.htm">400</a>，<a href="505.htm">505</a>节）；因此，“裂为三段”表示被完全毁灭。论到“列族的城”的“倒塌”也表示被毁灭。经上之所以说“那大城裂为三段，列族的城也都倒塌了”，是因为刚才提到了地震，这些事就在地震中发生的。“大城”是指前面（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.8.htm">11:8</a>）所论及的大城，在那里它被称为“所多玛和埃及”（参看<a href="501.htm">501</a>-504节）。“城”之所以表示教义，因而“诸诚”表示诸教义，是因为“地”，尤其“迦南地”表示教会；并且由于教会通过并照着教义而成为教会，故“诸诚”表示诸教义。这些也在诸城被教导，因为犹太会堂就在诸城中；圣殿在耶路撒冷；正因如此，从普遍意义上说，“耶路撒冷”表示教义方面的教会。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 712</h4><p>712. <a href="3927/revelation_16_19.htm">16:19</a> And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. This symbolically means that by these events that church was utterly destroyed as regards its doctrine, and so too all the heresies that emanated from it.<p>A city symbolizes church doctrine, or what is the same, the church in respect to its doctrine, as may be seen in nos. <a href="194.htm">194</a>, <a href="501.htm">501</a>, <a href="502.htm">502</a> above. The cities of the nations accordingly symbolize the heretical doctrines or heresies that emanated from it, of which there are many. To be divided into three parts means, symbolically, to be utterly destroyed; for in the Word to be divided means, symbolically, to be scattered, because the parts do not then hold together, and the number three symbolizes everything or the totality (nos. <a href="400.htm">400</a>, <a href="505.htm">505</a>). Thus to be divided into three parts means, symbolically, to be utterly destroyed. Falling, which the cities of the nations are said to have done, also symbolically means to be destroyed.<p>We are told that the city was divided into three parts and that the cities of the nations fell because of the earthquake that occurred just before, in which such events take place.<p>The great city means the great city mentioned before in chapter <a href="3927/revelation_11_8.htm">11:8</a>, which is there called Sodom and Egypt. Regarding it, see nos. <a href="501.htm">501-504</a> above.<p>A city symbolizes doctrine, and cities therefore doctrinal teachings, because the earth or land, in particular the land of Canaan, symbolizes the church. And because the church is a church owing to its doctrine and in consequence of it, therefore cities symbolize doctrinal teachings. People were also taught in cities, because that is where the synagogues were and in Jerusalem the Temple. Jerusalem consequently symbolizes the church in respect to its doctrine in a universal sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 712</h4><p>712. [verse 19] 'And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell' signifies that by these things that Church as to doctrine has been entirely destroyed, and so too have all the heresies that have emanated from it. That by a 'city' is signified the doctrine of the Church or, what is the same, the Church as to doctrine, may be seen above (<a href="194.htm">194</a>, <a href="501.htm">501-502</a>). Consequently by 'the cities of the nations' are signified the heretical doctrines or heresies that have emanated from it; and these are many. By 'being divided into three parts' is signified being entirely destroyed, for by 'to be divided' in the Word is signified to be dissipated, because in that case they do not cohere, and by 'three' is signified all and the whole (<a href="400.htm">400</a>, <a href="505.htm">505</a>). Consequently by 'to be divided into three parts' is signified to be entirely destroyed. By 'to fall,' which is said of 'the cities of the nations,' is also signified to be destroyed. It is said that the city was divided into three parts, and that the cities of the nations fell, because [it treats] just before of an earthquake in which such things come to pass. By 'the great city' is understood the great city treated of above (chapter 11, verse 8) which there 'is called Sodom and Egypt,' concerning which <a href="501.htm">501-504</a> above may be seen. The reason that a 'city' signifies doctrine, and consequently 'cities' signify doctrinal tenets, is because by 'the land,' especially by 'the land of Canaan,' the Church is signified. And because a Church is a Church by virtue of doctrine and in accordance therewith, therefore doctrinal tenets are signified by 'cities.' They also used to teach in cities, because the synagogues were there, and in Jerusalem the temple also. This is why by 'Jerusalem' is signified the Church as to doctrine in a universal sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 712</h4><p>712. Verse 19. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, signifies that that Church as to doctrine was altogether destroyed by them, and likewise all the heresies which have emanated from it. That the doctrine of the church is signified by "a city," or what is the same, the church as to doctrine, may be seen above, (<a href="194.htm">194</a>[1-4], <a href="501.htm">501</a>, <a href="502.htm">502</a>): hence by "the cities of the nations" are signified the heretical doctrines or heresies which have emanated from it, which are many. By "being divided into three parts" is signified to be altogether destroyed; for by "being divided" in the Word is signified to be dissipated, because in that case they do not cohere, and by "three" is signified all and the whole, (<a href="400.htm">400</a>, <a href="505.htm">505</a>); hence by "being divided into three parts" is signified to be altogether destroyed. By "falling," which is said of the cities of the nations, is also signified to be destroyed. It is said that "the city was divided into three parts," and that "the cities of the nations fell," because an earthquake was mentioned just before, in which such effects have place. By "the great city" is meant the great city spoken of above (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_11_8.htm">11:8</a>), which is there called "Sodom and Egypt," as may be seen above, (<a href="501.htm">501-504</a>). The reason why "a city" signifies doctrine, and thence "cities" signify doctrinals, is, because by "land," and particularly by "the land of Canaan," is signified the church; and since the church is a church from doctrine and according to it, therefore by "cities" are signified doctrinals. These were also taught in cities, because in them were synagogues, and in Jerusalem was the temple; hence it is that by Jerusalem is signified the church as to doctrine in a universal sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 712 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>712. (Vers. 19.) "Et facta est urbs magna in tres partes, et urbes gentium ceciderunt," significat quod Ecclesia illa quoad doctrinam ab illis prorsus destructa sit, pariter omnes haereses quae ab illa emanarunt. - Quod per "urbem" significetur doctrina Ecclesiae, seu quod idem Ecclesia quoad doctrinam, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_712/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_194" target=_top>194</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_712/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_501" target=_top>501</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_712/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_502" target=_top>502</a>); inde per "urbes gentium" significantur doctrinae haereticae seu haereses, quae ex illa emanaverunt, quae sunt plures: per "fieri in tres partes" significatur prorsus destrui, nam per "dividi" in Verbo significatur dissipari, ex causa quia sic non cohaerent, et per "tria" significatur omne et totum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_712/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_400" target=_top>400</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_712/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_505" target=_top>505</a>); inde per "fieri in tres partes" significatur prorsus destrui: per "cadere," quod dicitur de urbibus gentium, etiam significatur destrui. Dicitur quod "urbs in tres partes facta sit," et quod "urbes gentium ceciderint," quia mox prius de terrae motu, in quo talia fiunt. Per "urbem magnam" intelligitur urbs magna de qua supra, (xi. vers. 8), quae ibi vocatur "Sodoma et Aegyptus," de qua videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_712/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_501" target=_top>501-504</a>). Quod "urbs" significet doctrinam, et inde "urbes" doctrinalia, est quia per "terram," in specie per "terram Canaanem," significatur Ecclesia; et quia Ecclesia est Ecclesia ex doctrina et secundum illam, inde per "urbes" significantur doctrinalia: docebantur etiam in urbibus, quia ibi erant Synagogae, et in Hierosolyma etiam Templum; inde est quod per "Hierosolymam" significetur Ecclesia quoad doctrinam in universali sensu. </p>
