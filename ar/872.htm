<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第872节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>872.启20:14.“死亡和阴间也被扔在火湖里”表本身已沦为魔鬼和撒但，而外在却像教会之人的内心邪恶者被投入地狱那些陷入邪恶之爱，因而陷入与邪恶一致的虚假之爱者当中。“死亡和阴间”表示本身内在已沦为魔鬼和撒但，而外在却像教会之人的内心邪恶者，如前所述（<a href="870.htm">870</a>节）。“火湖”表示地狱，就是那些陷入邪恶之爱，因而陷入与邪恶一致的虚假之爱，因而热爱邪恶，并通过源于属世人的推理，尤其通过圣言字义来确认它者所在之地。这些人本身内在只会否认神，因为这种否认就隐藏在以虚假所确认的生活邪恶里面。“湖”表示有大量虚假之处，“火”表示邪恶之爱，如前所述（<a href="835.htm">835</a>，<a href="864.htm">864</a>节）。经上说“死亡和阴间被扔在火湖里”是照着天使的语言来说的；天使的语言不会提及人名，而是提及在这个人里面，并构成这个人之物，在此提到的是在此人里面构成其死亡和阴间或地狱之物。事实的确如此，这一点从地狱无法被投入地狱的事实可以看出来。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 872</h4><p>872. <a href="3927/revelation_20_14.htm">20:14</a> Then Death and Hell were cast into the lake of fire. This symbolically means that the impious at heart, who in themselves were devils and satanic spirits, and yet in outward appearances seemed to be people of the church, were cast down into hell among spirits who were caught up in a love of evil and so in a love of falsity according with evil.<p>Death and Hell symbolize the impious at heart, who inwardly in themselves were devils and satanic spirits, and yet in outward appearances seemed to be people of the church, as in no. <a href="870.htm">870</a> above. The lake of fire symbolizes hell, where those people reside who are caught up in a love of evil and so in a love of falsity according with evil, thus who love evil and justify it by arguments arising from their natural selves, and still more so those who justify it by the literal sense of the Word. Inwardly in themselves these cannot but deny God, for such a denial is subconsciously latent in any evil life practice that is justified by falsities. The lake symbolizes a circumstance in which there is an abundance of falsities, and fire symbolizes a love of evil, as in nos. <a href="835.htm">835</a>, <a href="864.htm">864</a> above.<p>Our being told that Death and Hell were cast into the lake of fire accords with the speech of angels, in which persons are not named, but instead that which is in a person and makes him who he is. In the present case that which is in the person makes of him death and hell. The reality of this can be seen from the fact that hell cannot be cast into hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 872</h4><p>872. [verse 14] 'And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire' signifies that the wicked-hearted, who in themselves were devils and satans and yet in external things like men of the Church, were cast down into hell among those who were in the love of evil and consequently in the love of untruths agreeing with evil. By 'death and hell' are signified the wicked-hearted who interiorly in themselves were devils and satans, and yet in external things like the men of the Church, as above (<a href="870.htm">870</a>). By 'the lake of fire' is signified hell, where those are who are in the love of evil and consequently in the love of the untruth agreeing with evil, thus who love evil and confirm it by reasonings derived from the natural man, and still more those who confirm it by means of the sense of the letter of the Word. These cannot interiorly in themselves do other than deny God, for this lies concealed in evil of life confirmed by untruths. The 'lake' signifies where there is untruth in abundance, and 'fire' signifies the love of evil, as above (<a href="835.htm">835</a>, <a href="864.htm">864</a>). Its being said that 'death and hell were cast into the lake of fire' is in accordance with angelic speech, in which persons are not named but that which is in the person and makes him, here what in the person makes his death and hell. That this is the case can be seen from the fact that hell cannot be cast into hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 872</h4><p>872. Verse 14. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire, signifies that the wicked at heart, who in themselves were devils and satans, and yet in externals like men of the church, were cast into hell among those who were in the love of evil, and thence in the love of falsity agreeing with evil. By "death and hell" are signified the wicked at heart, who interiorly in themselves were devils and satans, and yet in externals like men of the church, as above, (<a href="870.htm">870</a>). By "the lake of fire" is signified hell, where they are who are in the love of evil, and thus in the love of the falsity agreeing with evil, thus who love evil, and confirm it by reasonings from the natural man, and still more they who confirm it by the sense of the letter of the Word. These cannot interiorly in themselves do otherwise than deny God, for such denial lies concealed in evil of life confirmed by falsities. "A lake" signifies where falsity abounds, and "fire" signifies the love of evil, as above, (<a href="835.htm">835</a>, <a href="864.htm">864</a>). Its being said that "death and hell were cast into the lake of fire," is according to angelic speech, in which the person is not named, but that which is in the person, and makes him; here that in the person which makes his death and hell; that this is the case, may be seen from this that hell cannot be cast into hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 872 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>872. (Vers. 14.) "Et Mors at Infernus conjecti sunt in stagnum ignis," significat quod impii corde qui in se diaboli et satanae erant, et tamen in externis sicut homines Ecclesiae, dejecti sint in Infernum inter illos qui in amore mali et inde in amore falsi concordantis cum malo erant. - Per "Mortem et Infernum" significantur impii corde, qui interius in se diaboli et satanae erant, et tamen in externis sicut homines Ecclesiae, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_872/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_870" target=_top>870</a>). Per "stagnum ignis" significatur infernum ubi sunt illi qui in amore mali et inde in amore falsi concordantis cum malo, ita qui amant malum, et confirmant illud per ratiocinia ex naturali homine, et plus qui confirmant illud per Sensum literae Verbi; hi non possunt aliter quam interius in se negare Deum, nam hoc in malo vitae per falsa confirmato latet reconditum: "stagnum" significat ubi falsum in copia, et "ignis" significat amorem mali, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_872/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_835" target=_top>835</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_872/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_864" target=_top>864</a>). <sup>1</sup>Quod dicatur quod "Mors et Infernus conjecti sint in stagnum ignis," est secundum loquelam angelicam, in qua non nominatur persona, sed id quod est in persona et facit illam, hic in persona quod facit mortem et infernum ejus; quod ita sit, videri potest ex eo quod Infernus non possit conjici in Infernum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;835 pro "841" </p>
