<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第231节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>231.“看那坐着的，好像碧玉和红宝石”表主的神性智慧和神性之爱在终层的表象。在圣言中，“石”表终层中的真理，“宝石”表因良善而透明的真理（<a href="915.htm">915</a>节）。灵界有红、白两种基色，白色源于天堂太阳之光，因而源于发白的属灵之光；红色源于天堂太阳之火，因而源于火红的属天之光。属灵天使因通过主处于智慧的真理，故处于那闪耀的白光，身穿白衣；属天天使因通过主处于爱之良善，故处于火焰之光，身穿红衣。因此，天上的大量宝石也有这两种颜色。这就是为何在圣言中，宝石表示诸如属于智慧之真理，或属于爱之良善那类事物的原因。“碧玉”因闪着白光，故表示属于智慧真理的事物；“红宝石”因发红，故表示属于爱之良善的事物。这些宝石之所以表示在终层的神性智慧和神性之爱的表象，是因为天上的所有宝石都源于圣言的终层，其透明则源于终层的灵义。这一事实可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/44.htm">44</a>-45节）一书。圣言的终层就是字义的真理与良善。这就是天上宝石的来源，对此，世人恐怕难以置信，因为他不知道，存在于灵界中的一切事物都是对应，存在于自然界中的一切事物则由此获得其属灵的源头。这就是天上宝石的来源，对此，我被恩准从天使的言谈得知，还亲眼见识到了，它们唯独通过主形成。而黑色也有两种，它们起源于地狱；一种与白色对立，那些歪曲圣言真理的人就具有这种黑色；另一种则与红对立，那些玷污圣言良善的人就具有这种黑色。前一种黑色属于撒旦，后一种黑色则属于魔鬼。“碧玉”和“红宝石”的含义可见于对启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.11.htm">21:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.18.htm">18-20</a>的解释。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 231</h4><p>231. And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance. (<a href="3927/revelation_4_3.htm">4:3</a>) This symbolizes an appearance of the Lord's Divine wisdom and love in outmost expressions.<p>In the Word a stone symbolizes truth in outmost expressions, and a precious stone symbolizes truth made translucent by the presence of good (no. <a href="915.htm">915</a>).<p>Two colors are fundamental to all the rest in the spiritual world: the color white and the color red. The color white takes its origin from the light of the sun in heaven, thus from spiritual light, which is bright white; and the color red takes its origin from the fire of the sun there, thus from celestial light, which is flaming.<p>Because spiritual angels are governed by truths of wisdom from the Lord, they live in that bright white light, and are therefore attired in white; and because celestial angels are governed by goods of love from the Lord, they live in that flaming light, and are therefore attired in red. These two colors are consequently found in precious stones in heaven, where they exist in great abundance.<p>It is owing to this that in the Word precious stones symbolize qualities connected with either the truth of wisdom or the goodness of love; and because jasper is bright white, it symbolizes qualities connected with the truth of wisdom, while because sardius is red, it symbolizes qualities connected with the goodness of love.<p>These stones symbolize an appearance of Divine wisdom and Divine love in outmost expressions because all precious stones in heaven draw their origin from the outmost constituents of the Word, and they owe their translucence to the spiritual meaning of the outmost expressions in it. The reality of this may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="44.htm">44</a>, <a href="45.htm">45</a>. The outmost expressions of the Word are the truths and goods in its literal sense.<p>Someone in our world can hardly believe that this is the origin of precious stones in heaven, because he does not know that everything found in the spiritual world is a correspondent form, and that everything found in the natural world takes its spiritual origin from those forms. From conversation with angels I have been given to know that this is the origin of precious stones in heaven, and also to see that it is the origin with my own eyes. It is the Lord alone, however, who causes their formation.<p>In contrast, dark colors take their origin from hell, of which there are also two. One is the opposite of white, the kind of darkness that exists with people who have falsified the truths of the Word. The other is the opposite of red, the kind of darkness that exists with those who have adulterated the goods of the Word. The first kind of darkness is satanic, the latter diabolical.<p>Regarding what jasper and sardius symbolize, more may be seen in the exposition of chapter <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21</a>, verses <a href="3927/revelation_21_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_18.htm">18-20</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 231</h4><p>231. [verse 3] 'And the One sitting looked like a stone of jasper and sardius' signifies the appearing of the Lord's Divine Wisdom and Divine Love in ultimates. A 'stone' in the Word signifies truths in ultimates, and a 'precious stone' truth transparent from good (<a href="915.htm">915</a>). Of the rest of the colours in the spiritual world two are fundamental, the colour white and the colour red. The colour white originates out of the light of the Sun in heaven, thus out of the spiritual light that is gleaming white; and the colour red originates out of the fire of the Sun there, thus out of the celestial light that is flaming. Spiritual angels, because they are in truths of wisdom derived from the Lord, are in the gleaming white light, and are therefore clothed in white; and celestial angels, because they are in goods of love from the Lord, are in the flaming light, and are therefore clothed in red. Consequently these two colours are also in the precious stones in heaven, where they are very plentiful. This is why precious stones in the Word signify such things as are either of the truth of wisdom, or the good of love; and a 'jasper,' because it gleams white, signifies the things that are of the truth of wisdom, while a 'sardius,' because it glows red, signifies the things that are of the good of love. These stones signify the appearing of Divine Wisdom and Divine Love in ultimates, because all the precious stones in heaven originate out of the ultimates of the Word, and are transparent out of the spiritual sense of the ultimates there. That this is the case may be seen in <a href="../ss/44.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 44-45</a>. The ultimates of the Word are the truths and goods of its sense of the letter. It can hardly be believed by anyone in our world that this is the origin of the precious stones in heaven, because he does not know that all the things that come into existence in the spiritual world are correspondences, and that all the things that come into existence in the natural world originate therefrom. It has been granted me to know as a result of speaking with angels, and to see also with my eyes, that this is the origin of the precious stones in heaven, but the formation of them is from the Only Lord. Black colours, however, originate out of hell. There are two of these also. One of them is in opposition to white-this blackness being with those who have falsified the truths of the Word; and the other is in opposition to red-this blackness being with those who have adulterated the goods of the Word. The latter blackness is diabolical, but the former is satanic. What 'jasper' and 'sardius' signify may be seen [in] more [detail] in the exposition of chapter <a href="3927/revelation_21_11.htm">21:11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_18.htm">18-20</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 231</h4><p>231. Verse 3. (<a href="3927/revelation_4_3.htm">Revelation 4:3</a>) And He that sat was in appearance like a jasper and sardius stone signifies the appearance of the Lord's Divine wisdom and Divine love in ultimates. "A stone," in the Word, signifies truth in ultimates, and "a precious stone," truth transparent from good, (<a href="915.htm">915</a>). There are two colors fundamental of the rest in the spiritual world, the color white and the color red, the color white derives its origin from the light of the sun in heaven, thus from spiritual light, which is shining white; and the color red derives its origin from the fire of the sun there, thus from celestial light, which is flaming. The spiritual angels, because they are in truths of wisdom from the Lord, are in that shining white light, therefore they are clothed in white; and the celestial angels, because they are in the good of love from the Lord, are in that flaming light, therefore they are clothed in red; thence those two colors also are in the precious stones in heaven, where they are in great abundance. This is the reason why precious stones, in the Word, signify such things as are of the truth of wisdom, or of the good of love, and that "the jasper," because it is shining white, signifies the things which are of the truth of wisdom; and "the sardius," because it is red, the things which are of the good of love. These stones signify the appearance of the Divine wisdom and the Divine love in ultimates, because all precious stones in heaven derive their origin from the ultimates of the Word, and their transparency from the spiritual sense of the ultimates. That this is the case, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, (<a href="44.htm">44</a>, <a href="45.htm">45</a>). The ultimates of the Word are the truths and goods of the sense of the letter. That this is the origin of precious stones in heaven can scarcely be believed by anyone in our world, because he does not know that all the things which exist in the spiritual world are correspondences, and that from thence all the things which exist in the natural world derive their spiritual origin. That this is the origin of precious stones in heaven has been granted me to know from speech with angels, and also to see it with my eyes, but the formation of them is from the Lord alone. But black colors, which are also two in number, derive their origin from hell; one in opposition to white, this blackness being with those who have falsified the truths of the Word; the other in opposition to red, this blackness being with those who have adulterated the goods of the Word; the latter blackness is diabolical, but the former satanic. The signification of "the jasper" and "the sardius" may be seen in the explanation of chapter <a href="3927/revelation_21_11.htm">21:11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_18.htm">18-20</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 231 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>231. (Vers. 3.) "Et Sedens erat similis aspectu lapidi Jaspidi et Sardio," significat apparentiam Divinae Sapientiae et Divini Amoris Domini in ultimis. - "Lapis" in Verbo significat verum in ultimis, et "lapis pretiosus" verum pellucens a bono (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_231/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_915" target=_top>915</a>). Sunt bini colores reliquorum fundamentales in mundo spirituali, color albus et color ruber. Color albus trahit suam originem ex Luce Solis in Caelo, ita ex Luce spirituali, quae est candida; et color ruber trahit suam originem ex Igne Solis ibi, ita ex Luce caelesti, quae est flammea. Angeli spirituales, quia in veris sapientiae sunt ex Domino, in Luce illa candida sunt, quare vestiti sunt albo; et Angeli caelestes, quia in bonis amoris sunt a Domino, in Luce illa flammea sunt, quare vestiti sunt rubro; inde sunt bini illi colores etiam in lapidibus pretiosis in Caelo, ubi in multa copia sunt. Ex eo est, quod lapides pretiosi in Verbo significent talia quae vel Veri sapientiae sunt, vel Boni amoris; et quod "Jaspis," quia candet, significet illa quae Veri sapientiae sunt; et "Sardius," quia rubescit, illa quae Boni amoris sunt. Quod lapides illi significent apparentiam Divinae Sapientiae et Divini Amoris in ultimis, est quia omnes lapides pretiosi in Caelo originem ducunt ex ultimis Verbi, ac pellucentiam ex spirituali Sensu ultimorum ibi; quod ita sit, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_231/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_44" target=_top>Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 44</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_231/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_45" target=_top>45</a>; ultima Verbi sunt vera et bona Sensus literae ejus. Quod haec origo lapidum pretiosorum sit in Caelo, aegre potest credi ab aliquo in nostro mundo, quia nescit quod omnia quae existunt in mundo spirituali - sint correspondentiae, et quod inde suam originem spiritualem trahant omnia quae existunt in mundo naturali; quod inde origo lapidum pretiosorum in Caelo sit, datum mihi est scire ex loquela cum angelis, et quoque videre oculis, sed formatio illorum est a Solo Domino. Colores autem nigri trahunt suam originem ex Inferno, qui etiam sunt bini; unus oppositus albo (haec nigredo est apud illos qui falsificaverunt vera Verbi), alter oppositus rubro (haec nigredo est apud illos qui adulteraverunt bona Verbi); haec nigredo est diabolica, illa autem satanica. Quid "jaspis" et "sardius" significant, in explicatione capitis <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_231/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_11" target=_top>21:11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_231/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_18-20" target=_top>18-20</a>, plura videantur. </p>
