<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第621节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>621.“羔羊无论往哪里去，他们都跟随他”表他们通过对主的爱和信而与主结合，因为他们照祂的诫命生活。这就是所表示的，这一点从主的这些话明显看出来：</p><p>遵行我命令的，这人就是爱我的，我也要爱他，并到他那里去，与他同住。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">14:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.23.htm">23</a>）</p><p>羊的牧人既放出自己的羊来，就在他们前头走，羊也跟着他，因为认得他的声音；我的羊听我的声音，我也认识他们，他们也跟着我。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.4.htm">10:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.27.htm">27</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 621</h4><p>621. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. This symbolically means that they are conjoined with the Lord through love and through faith in Him, because they lived in accordance with His commandments.<p>That this is the symbolic meaning is apparent from these words of the Lord:<p>He who... keeps (My commandments), it is he who loves Me. And... I will love him and... I will come to him and make My abode in him. (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-23</a>)<p>And elsewhere:<p>When (the shepherd of the sheep) brings out his own sheep, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice... My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. (<a href="3927/john_10_4.htm">John 10:4-5</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_27.htm">27</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 621</h4><p>621. 'These are they who are following the Lamb wherever He goes' signifies that they have been conjoined with the Lord through love and faith directed to Him, because they have lived in accordance with His precepts. That these things are signified is plain from these words of the Lord: He loves Me who does My precepts, and I will love him, and come to him, and make My abode with him. <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-23</a>.<p>And elsewhere: The Shepherd of the sheep, when He leads forth His Own sheep, goes forward with them, and the sheep follow Him, for they know His voice; My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. <a href="3927/john_10_4.htm">John 10:4-5</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_27.htm">27</a>.<p><a href="../ae/863.htm">Apocalypse Explained 863</a>[2]; but <a href="../ac/3081.htm">Arcana Caelestia 3081</a>[4] has 'Judah,' as in Hebrew.<p><a href="../ae/863.htm">Apocalypse Explained 863</a>[11]; but <a href="../ac/5236.htm">Arcana Caelestia 5236</a>[5] and <a href="../ac/5897.htm">Arcana Caelestia 5897</a>[7] have ejus (thereof) as in Hebrew. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 621</h4><p>621. These are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth, signifies that they are conjoined with the Lord through love and faith in Him, because they have lived according to His commandments. That this is what is signified is evident from these words of the Lord:<p>He that doeth My commandments, he loveth Me, and I will love him, and will come to him, and make My abode with him, (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-23</a>).<p>The shepherd of the sheep, when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice; My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me, (<a href="3927/john_10_4.htm">John 10:4-5</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_27.htm">27</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 621 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>621. "Hi sunt qui sequuntur Agnum quocunque vadit," significat quod conjuncti sint Domino per amorem et fidem in Ipsum, quia vixerunt secundum praecepta Ipsius. - Quod haec significentur, patet ab his Domini verbis "Qui facit praecepta Mea ille amat Me, et amabo illum, et ad illum veniam, et apud illum mansionem faciam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_621/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_20-23" target=_top>Johannes 14:20-23</a>);<p>et alibi: <p>Pastor ovium, "quando proprias oves eduxerit, coram illis incedit, et oves Ipsum sequuntur, quia sciunt vocem Ipsius: oves Meae vocem Meam audiunt, et Ego cognosco eas, et sequuntur Me," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_621/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_10_4-5" target=_top>Johannes 10:4-5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_621/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_10_27" target=_top>27</a>); </p>
