<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第549节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>549.启12:8.“他们并没有得胜，天上再没有他们的地方”表他们确信陷入了虚假与邪恶，但仍留在其中，因此被强行脱离了与天堂的联结，并被扔了下去。为了能理解这些事，必须先说一下那些死后进入来世之人的状态。在来世，所有人首先接受天使的教导，并被领到各个社群，接受审查，以查看他们是否会接受天上的真理，并照之生活。然而，所有那些在世时确认虚假的人都不接受它们；因此，他们被送往陷入类似虚假之人所在的社群，这些社群与地狱，而非天堂联结。所以，在灵人界度过一段时日后，他们便沉入地狱，照各人的邪恶和由此而来的虚假被送往他们的地方；这就是“他们确信陷入了虚假与邪恶，但仍留在其中，因此被强行脱离了与天堂的联结，并被扔了下去”的意思。至于他们在那里的命运如何，可参看前文（<a href="153.htm">153</a>，<a href="531.htm">531</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 549</h4><p>549. But they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer. (<a href="3927/revelation_12_8.htm">12:8</a>) This symbolically means that they were convicted of being caught up in falsities and evils, and yet they persisted in them, and therefore they were forcibly withdrawn from any conjunction with heaven and cast down.<p>For this to be understood, we must first say something about the state of people who come after death into the other life. All are there instructed by angels and led from one society to another, and they are examined to see whether they are willing to accept the truths of heaven and live in accordance with them. However, all those who in the world convinced themselves of falsities do not accept the truths. Therefore they are admitted into societies where the inhabitants are caught up in the same falsities, and these societies have no conjunction with heaven, but conjunction with hell. Consequently, after a period of time in the world of spirits they sink down into hell and are relegated to their own places, each one in accordance with his evil and resulting falsity. This is what is meant by their being convicted of being caught up in falsities and evils, and yet their persisting in them, and by their being forcibly withdrawn therefore from any conjunction with heaven and cast down.<p>What their fate there is like may be seen in nos. <a href="153.htm">153</a>, <a href="531.htm">531</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 549</h4><p>549. [verse 8] 'And they did not prevail, and their place was no longer found in heaven' signifies that they had been convicted of being in untruths and evils but still persisted in them, and that therefore they were forcibly separated from conjunction with heaven and cast down. In order that these things may be understood something shall first be said concerning the state of those who come into the other life after death. There all are first instructed by angels, and led from one society to another and examined [as to] whether they are willing to receive the truths of heaven and to live in accordance with them. Nevertheless, all who have confirmed the untruths pertaining to them in the world do not receive. They are therefore sent into societies where those who are in similar untruths are, and those societies do not have any conjunction with heaven, but with hell. After a limited time in the world of spirits they therefore sink down into hell and are sent away to their own places, each according to his own evil and consequent untruth. This is what is understood by their having been convicted of being in untruths and evils and still persisting in them, and that therefore they are forcibly separated from conjunction with heaven and cast down. What their lot there is may be seen above (<a href="153.htm">153</a>, <a href="531.htm">531</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 549</h4><p>549. Verse 8. And they prevailed not, and their place was not found any more in heaven, signifies that they were convicted of being in falsities and evils, but still they remained in them, and that therefore they were torn away from conjunction with heaven and cast down. That this may be understood, something must first be said concerning the state of those who come into the other life after death. All there are first instructed by angels, and led from one society to another, and explored whether they will receive the truths of heaven, and live according to them. But still, all those who have confirmed themselves in falsities in the world do not receive them; therefore they are sent into societies where they are who are in similar falsities, which societies have no conjunction with heaven, but with hell. Therefore after some time in the world of spirits they sink down into hell, and are sent away to their places, everyone according to his evil and falsity thence; this is what is meant by their being convicted of being in falsities and evils, and still they remain in them, and that therefore they are torn away from conjunction with heaven, and cast down. What their lot is there, may be seen above, (<a href="153.htm">153</a>, <a href="531.htm">531</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 549 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>549. (Vers. 8.) "Et non praevaluerunt, et non locus inventus eorum amplius in Caelo" significat quod convicti quod in falsis et malis essent, et usque permanserint in illis, et quod ideo ex conjunctione cum Caelo avulsi sint, et dejecti. - Ut haec intelligantur, prius aliquid de statu illorum, qui in alteram vitam post mortem veniunt, dicetur: Omnes ibi primum instruuntur ab angelis, et ducuntur ab una societate in alteram, et explorantur num velint vera Caeli recipere, et vivere secundum illa. Sed usque omnes illi qui confirma verum falsa apud se in mundo, non recipiunt: quare mittuntur in societates ubi sunt qui in similibus falsis, et illae societates non aliquam cum Caelo conjunctionem habent, sed cum Inferno; quare post exactum tempus in Mundo spirituum delabuntur in Infernum, ac relegantur ad loca sua, quisque secundum suum malum et inde falsum; hoc est quod intelligitur per quod convicti quod in falsis et malis essent, et usque permanserint in illis, et quod ideo ex conjunctione cum Caelo avulsi sint, et dejecti: qualis illis est sors ibi, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_549/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_153" target=_top>153</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_549/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_531" target=_top>531</a>). </p>
