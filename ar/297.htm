<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第297节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>297.“你来看”表按照顺序，第一类人的表现。前面说明（<a href="295.htm">295</a>节），本章描述了对所有受审判者生命状态的审查，主照着圣圣言来审查；故按顺序，此处描述对第一类人的审查，即审查他们对圣言的理解和由此而来的生命状态。教会出自圣言，教会的情形如何取决于教会对圣言的理解，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/76.htm">76</a>-79节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 297</h4><p>297. "Come and see." This symbolizes a manifestation regarding the people first in order.<p>We said above that this chapter describes an examination of all the people on whom the Last Judgment would fall as to their states of life, and this by the Lord in accordance with the Word (no. <a href="295.htm">295</a>). Described here therefore is an examination of the first people in order, as to their character in respect to their understanding of the Word and thus as to their states of life.<p>To be shown that the church is founded on the Word, and that its character is such as its understanding of the Word, see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="../ss/76.htm">76-79</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 297</h4><p>297. 'Come and look' signifies a manifestation concerning those first in order. It has been said above that in this chapter is described the examination of all those upon whom there is going to be the judgment, as to the states of their life, and this by the Lord in accordance with the Word (<a href="295.htm">295</a>). Here therefore is described the examination of those first in order, what they are like as to the understanding of the Word, and as a consequence the states of their life. That the Church has existence out of the Word, and that it is such as is the understanding it has of the Word, may be seen shown in <a href="../ss/76.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 76-79</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 297</h4><p>297. Come and look, signifies a manifestation concerning the first in order. It was said above, that in this chapter is described the exploration of all upon whom the judgment was about to come, as to their states of life, and this from the Lord according to the Word, (<a href="295.htm">295</a>); here therefore is described the exploration of the first in order, as to their understanding of the Word, and thence the states of their life. That the church is from the Word, and that it is such as is its understanding of the Word, may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, (<a href="76.htm">76-79</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 297 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>297. "Veni et aspice," significat manifestationem primis in ordine. - Supra dictum est, quod in hoc capite describatur exploratio omnium, super quos Judicium futurum est quoad status vitae eorum, et hoc a Domino secundum Verbum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_297/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_275" target=_top>275</a>); hic itaque describitur exploratio de primis in ordine, quales sunt quoad intellectum Verbi et inde status vitae eorum. Quod Ecclesia sit ex Verbo, et quod talis sit, qualis ei est intellectus Verbi, in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_297/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_76" target=_top>76-79</a>), ostensum videatur. </p>
