<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>599.“甚至在人面前，叫火从天降在地上”表证明他们的虚假是天上的真理，凡接受它们的人都得救，不接受者则灭亡。这些话之所以表示这些事，是因为最大的奇事就是从天降火；当论及对真理的见证时，古人当中这句确认的俗语便由此而来，即：他们能叫火从天而降，为它作见证。这句俗语表示他们能见证到这种程度。真理也通过天上的火被见证，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>亚伦所献的燔祭被天上来的火烧尽。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利9.24.htm">9:24</a>）</p><p>以利亚所献的燔祭也一样。（列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上18.38.htm">18:38</a>）</p><p>“天上的火”在反面意义上则是见证他们陷入邪恶，由此陷入虚假，并要灭亡的征兆；不过，这火是吞灭或烧灭之火；如：</p><p>从天而降、烧死亚伦两个儿子的火。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.1.htm">10:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>烧灭二百五十人的火。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民26.10.htm">26:10</a>）</p><p>直烧到营地边界的火。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民11.1.htm">11:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民11.4.htm">4</a>）</p><p>两次烧灭王所差遣的五十人之火。（列王纪下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下1.10.htm">1:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下1.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>从天降在所多玛的火与硫磺。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创19.24.htm">19:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创19.25.htm">25</a>）</p><p>从天而降、烧灭那些围住圣徒的营和蒙爱的城之人的火。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.9.htm">20:9</a>）</p><p>门徒恼怒那些不知悔改的人，对耶稣说，主啊，你要不要我们吩咐火从天上降下来烧灭他们？（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.54.htm">9:54</a>）</p><p>引用这些经文是为了说明“天上的火”表示一个见证，甚至证实，证明真理是真理的，在反面意义上则证明虚假是真理，如此处。“火”还表示属天之爱，因而表示对真理的热情，在反面意义上表示地狱之爱，因而表示对虚假的热情。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 599</h4><p>599. So as to even make fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of men. This symbolizes assertions that their falsities are truths from heaven, that people who accept them are saved, and that people who do not accept them perish.<p>This is the symbolism of these words, because the greatest signs were produced by fire from heaven. It was therefore a common expression of assurance among the ancients that, when bearing witness to some truth, they could rain down fire from heaven to attest to it. And this symbolically meant that they could attest to it to such a degree of certainty.<p>That fire from heaven also did attest to truth is apparent from the fact that the burnt offering offered by Aaron was consumed by fire from heaven (<a href="3927/leviticus_9_24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>). So, too, the burnt offering offered by Elijah (<a href="3927/1-kings_18_38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>).</p><p>[2] In an opposite sense, fire from heaven was a sign attesting that the people were caught up in evils and the accompanying falsities, and so would perish. But that fire was a consuming fire, such as the fire from heaven that consumed Aaron's two sons in <a href="3927/leviticus_10_1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-6</a>; that consumed the two hundred and fifty men in <a href="3927/numbers_26_10.htm">Numbers 26:10</a>; that consumed the outskirts of the camp in <a href="3927/numbers_11_1.htm">Numbers 11:1-3</a>; and the fire from heaven that consumed the people who surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city in <a href="3927/revelation_20_9.htm">Revelation 20:9</a>. Once, when incensed at some impenitent people, the disciples said to Jesus, "Do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?" (<a href="3927/luke_9_54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>).<p>We cite these instances to show that fire from heaven symbolizes an attestation, indeed an assurance, that truth is true, and in an opposite sense, that falsity is true, as in the present instance.<p>Fire also symbolizes a heavenly love and so a zeal for truth, and in an opposite sense a hellish love and so a zeal for falsity (nos. <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="494.htm">494</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 599</h4><p>599. 'So that he also makes fire come down out of heaven into the land in the presence of men' signifies attestations that their untruths are truths of heaven, and that those who receive them are saved, and those who do not, perish. These things are signified by those words because the greatest signs have been done by means of fire out of heaven; whence it was a common saying of confirmation among the ancients, when anyone was making a testification of the truth, that they could make fire come down out of heaven and testify it. By this it was signified that they could testify even to that extent. That the truth (veritas) was also testified by means of fire out of heaven is plain from these references:<p>That the burnt offering made on the part of Aaron was consumed by fire out of heaven. <a href="3927/leviticus_9_24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>.<p>In like manner the burnt offering made by Elijah, <a href="3927/1-kings_18_38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>.</p><p>[2] In the opposite sense 'fire out of heaven' was a sign testifying that they were in evils and the untruths therefrom, and that they would perish; but that fire was a consuming fire, as:<p>The fire out of heaven that consumed Aaron's two sons. <a href="3927/leviticus_10_1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-6</a>.<p>That which consumed 250 men. <a href="3927/numbers_26_10.htm">Numbers 26:10</a>.<p>That which consumed the uttermost parts of the camp. <a href="3927/numbers_11_1.htm">Numbers 11:1-4</a>.<p>That which twice consumed fifty men sent by the king to Elijah, <a href="3927/2-kings_1_11.htm">2 Kings 1:11-12</a>.<p>The fire and sulphur out of heaven upon Sodom. <a href="3927/genesis_19_24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>.<p>The fire out of heaven that consumed those who encompassed the camp of the saints and the beloved city (concerning which [see, <a href="3927/revelation_20_9.htm">Revelation 20:9</a>).<p>The disciples when enraged against the impenitent [Samaritans] said to Jesus, Wilt Thou We call for fire coming down out of heaven do consume them? <a href="3927/luke_9_54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>.<p>These passages have been adduceth in order that it may be known that 'fire out of heaven' signifies a testification, even an attestation, that a truth is true, and in the opposite sense that an untruths is true, as here. Moreover 'fire' signifies heavenly love, and the zeal therefrom for truth, and in the opposite sense infernal love, and the zeal therefrom for untruth (<a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="494.htm">494</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 599</h4><p>599. So that he also maketh fire to come down from heaven upon earth before men, signifies attestations that their falsities are truths of heaven, and that they who receive them are saved, and that they who do not receive them perish. The reason why this is signified by these words, is, because the greatest signs were made by fire from heaven; whence it was a common expression among the ancients in confirmation of anything, when the attestation of truth was spoken of, that "they could bring down fire from heaven and testify it;" by which was signified that they could testify even to that extent. That the truth was also attested by "fire from heaven," appears from the following passages:<p>That the burnt-offering which was offered by Aaron was consumed by fire from heaven, (<a href="3927/leviticus_9_24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>).<p>In like manner the burnt-offering offered by Elijah, (<a href="3927/1-kings_18_38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>).</p><p>[2] "Fire from heaven," in the opposite sense, was a sign testifying that they were in evils and thence in falsities and that they would perish; but this fire was a consuming fire; as:<p>The fire from heaven that consumed the two sons of Aaron, (<a href="3927/leviticus_10_1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-6</a>).<p>That which consumed two hundred and fifty men, (<a href="3927/numbers_26_10.htm">Numbers 26:10</a>).<p>That which consumed the uttermost parts of the camp, (<a href="3927/numbers_11_1.htm">Numbers 11:1-4</a>).<p>That which twice consumed fifty men sent by the king to Elijah, (<a href="3927/2-kings_1_10.htm">2 Kings 1:10</a>, <a href="3927/2-kings_1_12.htm">12</a>).<p>The fire and brimstone from heaven upon Sodom, (<a href="3927/genesis_19_24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>).<p>The fire from heaven which consumed those who compassed the camp of the saints and the beloved city (concerning which see <a href="3927/revelation_20_9.htm">Revelation 20:9</a>).<p>The disciples being angry with the impenitent, said to Jesus, Lord, wilt Thou that we call fire to come down from heaven and consume them? (<a href="3927/luke_9_54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>).<p>These passages are adduced to show that "fire from heaven" signifies a testification, yea, an attestation, that truth is truth, and, in the opposite sense, that falsity is truth, as here. "Fire" also signifies celestial love, and thus zeal for the truth, and in the opposite sense, infernal love, and thence zeal for falsity, (<a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="494.htm">494</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 599 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>599. "Ut et ignem faciat descendere e Caelo in terram coram hominibus," significat contestationes quod falsa illorum sint vera Caeli, et quod qui illa recipiunt, salventur, et qui non recipiunt, pereant. - Quod haec significentur per illa verba, est quia maxima signa facta sunt per ignem e Caelo; unde communis loquela confirmationis, cum de testificatione veri agebatur, apud antiquos fuit, quod "ignem possint facere descendere e Caelo, et id testificari;" per quod significabatur, quod eo usque testificari possent. Quod etiam veritas testificata sit per "ignem e Caelo," patet ex his: <p>Quod Holocaustum ex Aharone factum per ignem e Caelo consumptum sit, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_599/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_9_24" target=_top>Leviticus 9:24</a>);<p>Similiter Holocaustum factum ab Elia, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_599/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_1-kings_18_38" target=_top>1 Regnum 18:38</a>).<p>"Ignis e Caelo" in opposito sensu fuit signum testificans quod in malis et inde falsis essent, et quod perirent, sed ille ignis fuit ignis consumens; sicut ignis e Caelo, <p>Qui consumpsit duos filios Aharonis, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_599/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_10_1-6" target=_top>Leviticus 10:1-6</a>);<p>Qui consumpsit quinquaginta et ducentos viros, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_599/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_26_10" target=_top>Numeri 26:10</a>);<p>Qui consumpsit extrema castrorum, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_599/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_11_1-4" target=_top>Numeri 11:1-4</a>);<p>Qui bis consumpsit quinquaginta viros a Rege ad Eliam missos (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_599/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-kings_1_10" target=_top>2 Regnum 1:10</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_599/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-kings_1_12" target=_top>12</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>Ignis et sulphur e Caelo super Sodomam, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_599/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_19_24-25" target=_top>Genesis 19:24-25</a>);<p>Ignis e Caelo qui consumpsit illos qui circumdederunt castra sanctorum et urbem dilectam (de quo <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_599/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_9" target=_top>Apocalypsis 20:9</a>);<p>Discipuli irati contra impaenitentes dixerunt ad Jesum, "Visne dicamus ut Ignis descendat e Caelo, et consumat eos," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_599/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_9_54" target=_top>Luca 9:54</a>).<p>Haec adducta sunt, ut sciatur quod "ignis e Caelo" significet testificationem, imo contestationem, quod verum sit verum, et in opposito sensu quod falsum sit verum, ut hic. <p>Praeterea "ignis" significat amorem caelestem, et inde zelum pro vero, et in opposito sensu amorem infernalem, et inde zelum pro falso (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_599/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_468" target=_top>468</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_599/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_494" target=_top>494</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;2 Reg. pro "1 Reg." </p>
