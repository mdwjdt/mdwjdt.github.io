<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第539节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>539.“十角”表大有能力。“角”表示能力（<a href="270.htm">270</a>节）；“十”表示大量（<a href="101.htm">101</a>节）。经上之所以说“龙”大有能力，是因为人凭唯信（这信由“龙”来表示）而无需律法行为的得救迷惑人心，然后确认使之信服。这信之所以极具诱惑力，是因为人一听到律法的谴罚被拿走，并且主的功德通过唯独相信这一点而被归算给他，就能放纵心智与身体的快乐，毫不畏惧地狱；“龙的十角”所表示的能力由此而来。他的确拥有这种能力，这一点从整个改革宗基督教界到处接受这信很明显地看出来。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 539</h4><p>539. And ten horns. This symbolizes much power. A horn symbolizes power (no. <a href="270.htm">270</a>), and the number ten symbolizes much (no. <a href="101.htm">101</a>).<p>The dragon is said to have much power because the salvation of mankind by faith alone apart from works of the Law - the faith meant by the dragon - captivates hearts, and then arguments in support of it persuade them. It captivates, indeed, because when a person hears that the condemnation of the Law has been taken away and that the Lord's merit is imputed to him simply by faith in that fact, he can indulge the appetites of his heart and body, without any fear of hell. This gives that faith power, which is symbolized by the dragon's ten horns. That it has had that power is clearly apparent from the acceptance of that faith throughout the whole Protestant Reformed Christian world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 539</h4><p>539. 'And ten horns' signifies much power. 'A horn' signifies power (<a href="270.htm">270</a>), and 'ten' signify much (<a href="101.htm">101</a>). The dragon is said to have much power because the salvation of man by faith alone without the works of the law, which faith is understood by 'the dragon,' seeks to entrap minds, and then confirmations persuade. It entraps because when a man hears that the damnation of the law has been withstood, and that through faith alone in this the Lord's merit will be imputed, he can indulge in the pleasures of mind (animus) and body and not be afraid of any hell. The power that is signified by the dragon's 'ten horns' results from this. That he did have such power is manifestly plain because of the reception of that faith throughout the Reformed Christian world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 539</h4><p>539. And ten horns, signifies much power. "A horn" signifies power, (<a href="270.htm">270</a>), and "ten" signifies much, (<a href="101.htm">101</a>[1-3]). The reason why it is said that the dragon has much power, is, because the salvation of man by faith alone, without the works of the law, which faith is meant by "the dragon," captivates minds, and then confirmations persuade. It captivates, because man, on hearing that the damnation of the law is taken away, and the Lord's merit is imputed to him through faith alone in this, he can indulge in the pleasures of his mind and body, without any fear of hell; hence comes the power which is signified by "the ten horns of the dragon." That such has been his power, evidently appears from the reception of that faith everywhere throughout the Reformed Christian world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 539 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>539. "Et cornua decem," significat potentiam multam. - "Cornu" significat potentiam (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_539/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_270" target=_top>270</a>); et "decem" significat multum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_539/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_101" target=_top>101</a>). Quod dicatur quod Draconi sit multa potentia, est quia salvatio hominis per solam fidem absque operibus legis, quae fides per "Draconem" intelligitur, captat animos, et tunc confirmationes persuadent; captat enim, quia homo cum audit quod damnatio legis sublata sit, ac meritum Domini illi per solam fidem in illud imputetur, potest indulgere voluptatibus animi et corporis Sui, ac non timere aliquod Infernum inde est potentia, quae per "decem cornua Draconis" significatur; quod talis fuerit ei potentia, evidenter patet ex receptione illius fidei in toto Orbe Christiano Reformato. </p>
