<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第65节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>65.“那七星就是七个教会的天使”表诸天堂中的新教会，也就是新天堂。教会在天上，和在地上一样。因为圣言在天上，和在地上一样，也有取自圣言的教义和布道。关于这个主题，可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/70.htm">70</a>-75和<a href="../ss/104.htm">104</a>-113节）。该教会就是新天堂，对此，序言中有所说明。“七星”之所以表示诸天堂中的教会，或新天堂，是因为经上说“那七星就是七个教会的天使”，而“天使”表示天上的社群。灵界有看似布满星辰的穹苍，这种表象就来自天上的各天使社群。在下面的人看来，那里的每个社群闪耀如星辰，他们因此知道天使的社群各在哪个位置。“七”不是指数字七，而是指照着各自的接受程度而属于天上教会的所有信徒（<a href="10.htm">10</a>，<a href="14.htm">14</a>，<a href="41.htm">41</a>节）；因此，“七个教会的天使”表示诸天堂中的整个教会，也就是整体上的新天堂。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 65</h4><p>65. "The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches." This symbolizes a new church in the heavens, which is the New Heaven.<p>The church exists in heaven as well as on earth, for the Word exists in heaven as on the earth, and people there draw doctrines from it, and preach sermons from it (on which subject see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="../ss/70.htm">70-75</a> and <a href="../ss/104.htm">104-113</a>). This church is the new heaven that we said something about in the Preface.<p>The church in the heavens or New Heaven is meant by the seven stars, because we are told that the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and an angel symbolizes a heavenly society.<p>The sky in the spiritual world appears filled with stars as in the natural world, and this appearance is owing to the angelic societies in heaven. Every society there shines like a star in the eyes of inhabitants who dwell below. Because of this they know there where the angelic societies are situated.<p>To be shown that seven symbolically does not mean seven, but all who are constituents of the church there, according to each one's state of reception, see nos. <a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="14.htm">14</a>, and <a href="41.htm">41</a> above. Thus the angels of the seven churches mean the whole church in the heavens, thus the New Heaven in its entirety. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 65</h4><p>65. 'The seven stars are the Angels of the seven Churches' signifies the new Church in the heavens, which is the New Heaven. There is a Church in the heavens just as there is a Church on earth (in terris), for in the heavens just as on earth there is the Word, and there are doctrines out of that Word, and there are preachings out of it, on which subject [something] may be seen in [THE DOCTRINE OF] <a href="../ss/70.htm">THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 70-75</a>, <a href="../ss/104.htm">104-113</a>. That Church is the New Heaven, about which something has been said in the Preface. The Church in the heavens, or the New Heaven, is understood by 'the seven stars,' because it is said that 'the seven stars are the Angels of the seven Churches,' and by 'Angel' is signified a heavenly society. In the spiritual world an expanse full of stars appears as in the natural world, and it appears in consequence of the angelic societies in heaven, any one society there shining as a star in the presence of those who are below. Those there know from this in what situation angelic societies are. That 'seven' does not signify seven, but all who belong to the Church there in accordance with the reception of each one, may be seen above (<a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="14.htm">14</a>, <a href="41.htm">41</a>); therefore by 'the Angels of the seven Churches' the entire Church in the heavens is understood, thus the New Heaven in its whole compass. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 65</h4><p>65. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, signifies the New Church in the heavens, which is the New Heaven. The church is in the heavens equally as on the earth; for the Word is in the heavens equally as it is on the earth, and there are doctrines from it, and preachings from it; on which subject see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, (<a href="../ss/70.htm">70-75</a>, <a href="../ss/104.htm">104-113</a>). That church is the New Heaven, concerning which something is said in the preface. The reason why the church in the heavens, or the New Heaven, is meant by "the seven stars," is, because it is said, that "the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches," and by "angel" is signified a heavenly society. In the spiritual world there appears an expanse full of stars, as in the natural world, and this appearance is from the angelic societies in heaven. Each society there shines like a star before those who are below; hence they there know in what situation the angelic societies are. That "seven" does not signify seven, but all who are of the church there according to the reception of each, may be seen above, (<a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="14.htm">14</a>, <a href="41.htm">41</a>); therefore, by "the angels of the seven churches," is meant the entire church in the heavens, consequently the New Heaven in the aggregate. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 65 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>65. "Septem Stellae Angeli septem Ecclesiarum sunt," significat novam Ecclesiam in Caelis, quae est Novum Caelum. - In Caelis aeque est Ecclesia ut in terris, nam in Caelis aeque est Verbum ut in terris, suntque doctrinae ex illo, et sunt praedicationes ex illo, de quare videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_65/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_70" target=_top>Nova Hierosolyma de Scriptura Sacra 70-75</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_65/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_104" target=_top>104-113</a>; illa Ecclesia est Novum Caelum, de quo in Praefatione aliquid dictum est. Quod Ecclesia in Caelis, seu Novum Caelum, intelligatur per "septem Stellas," est quia dicitur quod "septem Stellae Angeli septem Ecclesiarum" sint, et per "Angelum" significatur Societas caelestis. Apparet in Mundo spirituali Expansum stellis plenum sicut in Mundo naturali, et id apparet ex Societatibus Angelicis in Caelo; unaquaevis Societas ibi coram illis qui infra sunt, lucet ut Stella; inde sciunt ibi, in quo situ Societates Angelicae sunt. Quod "septem" non significent septem, sed, omnes qui ab Ecclesia ibi sunt, secundum receptionem cujusvis, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_65/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_10" target=_top>10</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_65/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_14" target=_top>14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_65/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_41" target=_top>41</a>); ita per "Angelos septem Ecclesiarum" intelligitur universa Ecclesia in Caelis, ita Novum Caelum in toto complexu. </p>
