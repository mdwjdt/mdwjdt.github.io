<p>51.“祂右手拿着七星”表由此与天上的天使并教会中人同在的圣言所蕴含的对良善与真理的一切认知。当众天使在诸天堂下面时，其周围看似有众多小星星环绕。灵人若在世时为自己获取对良善和真理的认知，或从圣言获取生命真理和教义，同样有小星星环绕。然而，这些小星星在那些从圣言获取纯正真理之人周围看似固定，而在那些获取被歪曲了的真理之人周围则看似游荡。关于这些小星星，以及那里天空显现的星辰，我有许多奇妙之事可谈，不过与当前著作无关。由此明显可知，“众星”表出于圣言的良善与真理的认知。“人子右手拿着七星”表示这些认知唯独来自主。“七”表全部（参看<a href="10.htm">10</a>节）。</p><p>出于圣言的良善与真理的认知由“众星”来表示，这一点也可从以下经文看出来：</p><p>我必使这地荒凉，天上的众星群宿都不发光。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.9.htm">13:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>荒凉的“地”是指教会，其“荒凉”表圣言中良善与真理的认知没有显现。</p><p>我将你扑灭的时候，要把诸天遮蔽、使众星昏暗；我必使亮光都在你以上变为昏暗，我要以黑暗遮蔽这地。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.7.htm">32:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.8.htm">8</a>）</p><p>“地上黑暗”表教会中的虚假。</p><p>日月昏暗，星辰收回其光辉。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.10.htm">2:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.15.htm">3:15</a>）</p><p>那些日子的灾难一过去，日头就变黑了，月亮也不放光，众星要从天上坠落。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.29.htm">24:29</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.24.htm">13:24</a>）</p><p>天上的星辰坠落于地，如同无花果树落下未熟的果子一样。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.13.htm">6:13</a>）</p><p>一个星从天落到地上。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.1.htm">9:1</a>）</p><p>“从天上坠落的众星”不是指星星，而是指对良善与真理的认知将要失落。</p><p>这一点从以下经文看得更清楚：</p><p>那龙拖拉着天上星辰的三分之一。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.4.htm">12:4</a>）</p><p>还有：</p><p>公山羊将些星宿抛落、践踏。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.9.htm">8:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.11.htm">11</a>）</p><p>故在但以理书的下一节，经上还说</p><p>它将真理抛在地上。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.12.htm">8:12</a>）</p><p>在以下经文中，对良善与真理的认知也由“众星”来表示：</p><p>耶和华数点星宿的数目；一一称它们的名。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗147.4.htm">147:4</a>）</p><p>放光的星宿，你们都要赞美耶和华。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.3.htm">148:3</a>）</p><p>星宿从其轨道争战。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.20.htm">5:20</a>）</p><p>由此明显可知但以理书中这些话是什么意思：</p><p>智慧人辉煌，如同穹苍的光耀，那使多人归义的，必如星辰，直到世世代代。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但12.3.htm">12:3</a>）</p><p>“智慧人”是指处于真理的人，“使多人归义的”是指处于良善的人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 51</h4><p>51. Having in His right hand seven stars. (<a href="3927/revelation_1_16.htm">1:16</a>) This symbolizes all concepts of goodness and truth in the Word, which exist therefore in angels in heaven and in people in the church.<p>When angels are below the heavens, a great number of what look like little stars appear around them, and likewise around spirits who, when they lived in the world, acquired concepts of goodness and truth for themselves from the Word, or truths of life and doctrine. These little stars appear fixed, however, in the case of those who possess genuine truths from the Word, but wandering in the case of those who possess falsified truths.<p>(Regarding these little stars, and the stars appearing in the sky there, I could relate marvelous things, but that is not the subject of this work.)<p>It is apparent from this that stars symbolize concepts of goodness and truth from the Word.<p>The Son of Man's having them in His right hand means, symbolically, that they come from the Lord alone through the Word. Seven symbolically means all, as may be seen in no. <a href="10.htm">10</a> above.</p><p>[2] That stars symbolize concepts of goodness and truth from the Word may be seen also from the following passages:<p>(I will) turn the earth into a wasteland... ...the stars of heaven and their constellations will not give their light. (<a href="3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">Isaiah 13:9-10</a>)<p>The earth that will be turned into a wasteland is the church, in which, having been laid waste, concepts of goodness and truth in the Word are not seen.<p>When I put out your light, I will cover the heavens... All the bright lights of the heavens I will make dark over you, and bring darkness upon your land. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_32_7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7-8</a>)<p>Darkness upon the land is the darkness of falsities in the church.<p>The sun and moon grow dark, and the stars diminish their brightness. (<a href="3927/joel_2_10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="3927/joel_3_15.htm">3:15</a>)<p>...after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven... (<a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>, cf. <a href="3927/mark_13_24.htm">Mark 13:24</a>)<p>The stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs... (<a href="3927/revelation_6_13.htm">Revelation 6:13</a>)<p>...a star (fell) from heaven to the earth. (<a href="3927/revelation_9_1.htm">Revelation 9:1</a>)<p>Stars falling from heaven do not mean stars, but concepts of goodness and truth perishing.</p><p>[3] This is still more apparent from the statement that a dragon swept down a third of the stars from heaven, in <a href="3927/revelation_12_4.htm">Revelation 12:4</a>, and the statement that a he-goat cast down some of the stars and trampled them, in <a href="3927/daniel_8_8.htm">Daniel 8:8-11</a>. That is why the next verse in Daniel goes on to say that it cast truth to the ground (<a href="3927/daniel_8_12.htm">Daniel 8:12</a>).<p>Stars also symbolize concepts of goodness and truth in the following passages:<p>(Jehovah) counts... the stars; He gives all of them names. (<a href="3927/psalms_147_4.htm">Psalms 147:4</a>)<p>Praise (Jehovah), all you stars of light! (<a href="3927/psalms_148_3.htm">Psalms 148:3</a>)<p>The stars from their courses fought... (<a href="3927/judges_5_20.htm">Judges 5:20</a>)<p>From this it is apparent what is meant by the following statement in Daniel:<p>The intelligent shall shine like the brightness of the firmament, ...those turning many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever. (<a href="3927/daniel_12_3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>)<p>The intelligent are people concerned with truths, and those turning many to righteousness are those concerned with goodness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 51</h4><p>51. [verse 16] 'And having in His right hand seven stars' signifies all the cognitions of good and truth in the Word that are therefrom with the angels of heaven and the men of the Church. Around angels, when they are below the heavens, appear little stars, as it were, in great abundance. They appear in like manner around spirits who, when they lived in the world, procured cognitions of good and truth, or truths of life and doctrine, for themselves out of the Word. These little stars, however, appear fixed with those who are in genuine truths out of the Word, but wandering with those who are in falsified truths. I am able to relate wonderful things about those little stars, as well as about the stars that appear in the expanse there, but it does not belong to this work. It is plain from these [considerations] that cognitions of good and truth out of the Word are signified by 'stars.' That the SON OF MAN had them in His right hand signifies that they are seen from the Only Lord by means of the Word. That 'seven' signifies all may be seen above (<a href="10.htm">10</a>).</p><p>[2] That cognitions of good and truth out of the Word are signified by 'stars' can also be seen from these passages:<p>I will lay the land waste, the stars of the heavens and the constellations thereof shall not shine with their light. <a href="3927/isaiah_13_10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>.<p>The 'land' that shall be laid waste is the Church. This having been laid waste, the cognitions of good and truth do not appear in the Word.<p>When I have extinguished thee, I will cover [the heavens], and make the stars dark: all the luminaries of light I shall make dark over thee, and I will give darkness upon the land. <a href="3927/ezekiel_32_7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7-8</a>.<p>'Darkness upon the land' is equivalent to untruths in the Church.<p>The sun and moon have been darkened, and the stars have diminished their brightness. <a href="3927/joel_2_10.htm">Joel 2:10-11</a>; <a href="3927/joel_3_15.htm">3:15</a> [H.B. 4:15].<p>After the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, the moon shall not give its light, and the stars shall fall down from heaven. <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_24.htm">Mark 13:24</a>.<p>The stars of heaven fell to earth as a fig tree casts her untimely figs. <a href="3927/revelation_6_13.htm">Revelation 6:13</a>.<p>A star fell from heaven to earth. <a href="3927/revelation_9_1.htm">Revelation 9:1</a>.<p>By 'stars falling from heaven' are not understood stars, but cognitions of good and truth that are going to perish.</p><p>[3] This is plainer still from the fact that:<p>The dragon drew the third part of the stars down from heaven. <a href="3927/revelation_12_4.htm">Revelation 12:4</a>.<p>Also, that:<p>The he-goat of the she-goats cast down some of the stars and stamped upon them. <a href="3927/daniel_8_9.htm">Daniel 8:9-11</a>.<p>Therefore in the following verse in Daniel it is said that:<p>It cast down the truth to earth. <a href="3927/daniel_8_12.htm">Daniel 8:12</a>.<p>Cognitions of good and truth are also signified by 'stars' in these places:<p>Jehovah tells the number of the stars; He calls them all by their names. <a href="3927/psalms_147_4.htm">Psalms 147:4</a>.<p>Praise Jehovah all you stars of light. <a href="3927/psalms_148_3.htm">Psalms 148:3</a>.<p>The stars fought down from their courses, <a href="3927/judges_5_20.htm">Judges 5:20</a>.<p>From these things it is plain what is understood by these words in Daniel:<p>The intelligent shalt shine as the brightness of the expanse, the justifying ones [shall be] as many as the stars for ages of ages. <a href="3927/daniel_12_3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>.<p>The 'intelligent' are those who are in truths, and 'the justifying ones' those who are in goods. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 51</h4><p>51. Verse 16. And having in His right hand seven stars, signifies all the knowledges of good and truth in the Word, which are thence with the angels of heaven and with the men of the church. Around the angels, when they are below the heavens, there appear, as it were, little stars in great abundance; and in like manner, around spirits, who, when they lived in the world, had acquired to themselves knowledges of good and truth, or truths of life and doctrine from the Word. These stars appear fixed, with those who are in genuine truths from the Word; but wandering with those who are in falsified truths. Concerning those little stars, as also concerning the stars which appear there in the firmament, I could relate wonderful things, but it does not belong to this work: hence it is evident that by "stars" are signified the knowledges of good and truth from the Word. "The Son of man had them in His right hand," signifies, that they are from the Lord alone through the Word. That "seven" signify all, may be seen above, (<a href="10.htm">10</a>).</p><p>[2] That the knowledges of good and truth from the Word, are signified by "stars," may also appear from these passages:<p>I will lay the earth waste; The stars of the heavens and the constellations thereof shall not give their light, (<a href="3927/isaiah_13_9.htm">Isaiah 13:9-10</a>).<p>"The earth" which shall be laid waste, is the church; which being vastated, the knowledges of good and truth in the Word do not appear:<p>And when I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heavens and make the stars thereof dark: All the luminaries of light will I make dark over thee, and I will set darkness upon the land, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_32_7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7-8</a>).<p>"Darkness upon the land," means falsities in the church:<p>The sun and the moon have been darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their splendor, (<a href="3927/joel_2_10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="3927/joel_3_15.htm">3:15</a>).<p>After the affliction of those days shall the sun be obscured, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, (<a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_24.htm">Mark 13:24</a>).<p>The stars of heaven fell to the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, (<a href="3927/revelation_6_13.htm">Revelation 6:13</a>).<p>A star fell from heaven to the earth, (<a href="3927/revelation_9_1.htm">Revelation 9:1</a>).<p>By "stars falling from heaven" are not meant stars, but that the knowledges of good and truth will perish.</p><p>[3] This is still more evident from its being said, that:<p>The dragon drew down the third part of the stars from heaven, (<a href="3927/revelation_12_4.htm">Revelation 12:4</a>).<p>Also that:<p>The he-goat cast down some of the stars and trampled them, (<a href="3927/daniel_8_9.htm">Daniel 8:9-11</a>).<p>Therefore in the next verse in Daniel it is also said that:<p>It cast down the truth to the earth, (<a href="3927/daniel_8_12.htm">Daniel 8:12</a>).<p>The knowledges of good and truth are also signified by "stars," in these passages:<p>Jehovah telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by names, (<a href="3927/psalms_147_4.htm">Psalms 147:4</a>).<p>Praise Jehovah, all ye stars of light, (<a href="3927/psalms_148_3.htm">Psalms 148:3</a>).<p>The stars fought in their ways, (<a href="3927/judges_5_20.htm">Judges 5:20</a>).<p>From hence it appears what is meant by these words in Daniel:<p>And the intelligent shall be resplendent as the splendor of the expanse, justifying many as the stars for ages of ages, (<a href="3927/daniel_12_3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>).<p>The "intelligent" are those who are in truths; "justifying" those who are in goods. </p>

"Et habens in dextra Sua manu Stellas septem," significat omnes cognitiones boni et veri in Verbo, quae inde apud angelos Caeli et apud homines Ecclesiae sunt. - Circum angelos, cum infra Caelos sunt, apparent sicut stellulae in multa copia; similiter circum spiritus, qui, dum in mundo vixerunt, cognitiones boni et veri, seu vera vitae et doctrinae sibi ex Verbo acquisiverunt: at stellulae illae apparent fixae apud illos qui in genuinis veris ex Verbo sunt, sed erraticae apud illos qui in veris falsificatis sunt. De his stellulis, tum de stellis apparentibus in expanso ibi, mirabilia possum referre, sed hoc non hujus operis est: ex his patet, quod per "Stellas" significentur cognitiones boni et veri ex Verbo.
