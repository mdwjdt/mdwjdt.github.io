<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>191.“我要叫他在我神殿中作柱子”表他们所居于其中的源自主之良善的真理支撑主在天上的教会。“殿”表教会，“我神殿”表主在天上的教会。由此明显可知，“柱子”表支撑教会，使教会坚固之物，也就是圣言的神性真理。在至高意义上，“殿”表主的神性人，尤表主的神性真理；在代表意义上，“殿”表主在天上和地上的教会。“殿”在至高意义上表主的神性人，尤表主的神性真理。这一点从以下经文明显可知：</p><p>耶稣对犹太人说，你们拆毁这殿，我三日内要再建立起来；祂这话，是指着祂身体的殿说的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.19.htm">2:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.21.htm">21</a>）</p><p>在新耶路撒冷内，我没有看见圣殿，因主神全能者和羔羊为城的殿。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.22.htm">21:22</a>）</p><p>看哪，主必忽然进入祂的殿，立约的使者，就是你们所仰慕的，快要来到。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.1.htm">3:1</a>）</p><p>我要向你的圣殿下拜。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗138.2.htm">138:2</a>）</p><p>我仍要仰望你的圣殿，我的祷告达到你面前，进入你的圣殿。（约拿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/拿 2.4.htm"> 2:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/拿2.7.htm">7</a>；哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.20.htm">2:20</a>）</p><p>耶和华或主的“圣殿”是指祂的神性人，因为下拜、仰望、祷告的对象是祂的神性人，而不仅仅是殿，殿本身并不神圣。它之所以被称为“圣殿”，是因为“神圣”论及神性真理（<a href="173.htm">173</a>节）。使金子成圣的殿（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.16.htm">23:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.17.htm">17</a>）无非表示主的神性人。</p><p>在代表意义上，“殿”表主在天上的教会。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>耶和华的声音从殿中传出。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.6.htm">66:6</a>）</p><p>有大声音从天上的殿中出来。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.17.htm">16:17</a>）</p><p>神天上的殿开了，在殿中现出祂的约柜。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.19.htm">11:19</a>）</p><p>天上那存法柜的殿开了；七位天使从殿中出来；因神的荣耀，殿中充满了烟。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启 15.5.htm"> 15:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启 15.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启 15.8.htm">8</a>）</p><p>我求告耶和华，向我的神呼求；祂从殿中听了我的声音。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.6.htm">18:6</a>）</p><p>我见主坐在高高举起的宝座上，祂的衣摆充满圣殿。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.1.htm">6:1</a>）</p><p>“殿”表地上的教会，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>我们圣洁的殿，已经遭火焚毁。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛64.11.htm">64:11</a>）</p><p>我必震动万族，使这殿满了荣耀。这殿后来的荣耀必大过先前的荣耀。（哈该书<a href="http://39-27.cn/该2.7.htm">2:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/该2.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>主将要建立的教会在以西结书（40-48章）以“新圣殿”来描述，由“天使所测量的殿”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.1.htm">11:1</a>）来表示。其它经文中的也一样（如以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.28.htm">44:28</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.2.htm">7:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.9.htm">9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.11.htm">11</a>；撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.9.htm">8:9</a>）。</p><p>门徒来到耶稣跟前，把殿的建筑指给他看；耶稣对他们说，我实在告诉你们，将来在这里，没有一块石头能留在石头上不被拆毁了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.1.htm">24:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.2.htm">2</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.1.htm">13:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.5.htm">5</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.5.htm">21:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.7.htm">7</a>）</p><p>此处的“殿”表如今的教会；“没有一块石头能留在石头上不被拆毁”表教会的末了，那时，教会将没有任何真理留下。因为当门徒向主谈论圣殿时，主就预言了该教会的相继状态，甚至直到教会的末了，或“时代的末了”，“时代的末了”表教会的末期，便是今日。这一切由圣殿被毁，直到露出地基来代表。</p><p>“殿”表这三者，就是主、天上的教会和地上的教会，因为这三者合而为一，不可分割，因此其中一个若离了另一个就无法理解的。人若将地上的教会与天上的教会分开，并将这些与主分开，就不在真理之中。“殿”在此之所以表示天上的教会，是因为后面论述的是地上的教会（<a href="194.htm">194</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 191</h4><p>191. "'I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God.'" This symbolically means that the truths they possess, springing from goodness derived from the Lord, sustain the Lord's church in heaven.<p>A temple symbolizes the church, and the temple of My God symbolizes the Lord's church in heaven. It is apparent from this that a pillar symbolizes what sustains and stabilizes the church, and that is the Divine truth in the Word.<p>In the highest sense, a temple symbolizes the Lord in respect to His Divine humanity, particularly in respect to Divine truth. In a representative sense, however, a temple symbolizes the Lord's church in heaven, and so also the Lord's church in the world.<p>That a temple in the highest sense symbolizes the Lord in respect to His Divine humanity, and particularly in respect to Divine truth, is apparent from the following passages:<p>(Jesus said to the Jews,) "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." ...He was speaking of the temple of His body. (<a href="3927/john_2_19.htm">John 2:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_2_21.htm">21</a>)<p>I saw no temple in (the New Jerusalem), for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. (<a href="3927/revelation_21_22.htm">Revelation 21:22</a>)<p>Behold..., the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to His temple, and the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire. (<a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>)<p>I will bow myself toward Your holy temple... (<a href="3927/psalms_138_2.htm">Psalms 138:2</a>)<p>...I will look again toward Your holy temple... And my prayer went to You, to Your holy temple. (<a href="3927/jonah_2_4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a>, <a href="3927/jonah_2_7.htm">7</a>)<p>Jehovah is in His holy temple. (<a href="3927/habakkuk_2_20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a>)<p>The holy temple of Jehovah or of the Lord is His Divine humanity, for it is to this that people bow, look to, and pray, and not to the temple merely, as the temple is not, in itself, holy. It is called a holy temple, because holiness is predicated of Divine truth (no. <a href="173.htm">173</a>).<p>"The temple that sanctifies the gold" in <a href="3927/matthew_23_16.htm">Matthew 23:16-17</a> means nothing else than the Lord's Divine humanity.</p><p>[2] That a temple in a representative sense symbolizes the Lord's church in heaven, is apparent from the following passages:<p>(The) voice (of Jehovah) from the temple...! (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_6.htm">Isaiah 66:6</a>)<p>...a loud voice came out of the temple of heaven... (<a href="3927/revelation_16_17.htm">Revelation 16:17</a>)<p>The temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple. (<a href="3927/revelation_11_19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>)<p>...the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened. And out of the temple came the seven angels... And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God... (<a href="3927/revelation_15_5.htm">Revelation 15:5-6</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_15_8.htm">8</a>)<p>I called upon Jehovah, and cried out to my God; He heard my voice from His temple... (<a href="3927/psalms_18_6.htm">Psalms 18:6</a>)<p>I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lofty, and His skirts filled the temple. (<a href="3927/isaiah_6_1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>)</p><p>[3] That a temple symbolizes the church in the world is apparent from these passages:<p>Our holy... temple... has become a conflagration... (<a href="3927/isaiah_64_11.htm">Isaiah 64:11</a>)<p>I will shake all nations..., that I may fill this house with glory... The glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former... (<a href="3927/haggai_2_7.htm">Haggai 2:7</a>, <a href="3927/haggai_2_9.htm">9</a>)<p>The new temple in <a href="3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_41_1.htm">41</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_42_1.htm">42</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_43_1.htm">43</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_44_1.htm">44</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_45_1.htm">45</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_46_1.htm">46</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_1.htm">47</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">48</a> describes a church to be established by the Lord. A church is also meant in <a href="3927/revelation_11_1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a> by the temple that the angel measured. So likewise elsewhere, as in <a href="3927/isaiah_44_28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2-4</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_9.htm">9-11</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_8_9.htm">Zechariah 8:9</a>.<p>...the disciples (of Jesus) came up to show Him the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said to them, ."..Assuredly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left... upon another, that shall not be demolished." (<a href="3927/matthew_24_1.htm">Matthew 24:1-2</a>)<p>The temple here symbolizes the church today; and its demolition means, symbolically, that not one stone would be left upon another. This symbolizes the end of that church, when not any truth would remain. For when the disciples spoke with the Lord about the temple, the Lord foretold the consecutive states of this church, even to its last one, or the end of the age; and the end of the age means the final period of the church, which is the one that exists today. This was represented by the destruction of that temple to its foundations.</p><p>[4] A temple has these three symbolic meanings, namely the Lord, the church in heaven, and the church in the world. Because these three are bound up together, they cannot be separated. Consequently one cannot be meant without the other. Therefore anyone who divorces the church in the world from the church in heaven, or the one or the other from the Lord, is without the truth.<p>The temple here means the church in heaven, because reference to the church in the world follows after this (no. <a href="194.htm">194</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 191</h4><p>191. 'Him will I make a pillar in the temple of My God' signifies that truths derived out of good from the Lord, with those who have them, sustain the Lord's Church in heaven. By a 'temple' the Church is signified, and by 'the temple of My God' the Lord's Church in heaven. It is plain from this that by a 'pillar' is signified that which sustains the Church and makes it firm, and this is the Divine Truth of the Word. By 'temple' is signified in the supreme sense the Lord as to the Divine Human, in a special sense as to Divine Truth; but in a representative sense by 'temple' is signified the Lord's Church in heaven; then also the Lord's Church in the world. That by 'temple' in the supreme sense is signified the Lord as to the Divine Human, and in a special sense as to Divine Truth, is plain from these passages:<p>Jesus said to the Jews, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up: He was speaking of the temple of His body. <a href="3927/john_2_18.htm">John 2:18-21</a>.<p>I saw no temple in the New Jerusalem, for the Lord God Omnipotent is the temple thereof and the Lamb. <a href="3927/revelation_21_22.htm">Revelation 21:22</a>.<p>Behold, the Lord shall suddenly come to His temple, and the angel of the covenant whom you seek, <a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3</a>:[<a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">1</a>].<p>I will bow down towards the temple of Thy holiness. <a href="3927/psalms_138_2.htm">Psalms 138:2</a>.<p>Yet will I look again toward the temple of thy holiness; and my prayer came unto Thee, to the temple of Thy holiness [<a href="3927/jonah_2_4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a>, <a href="3927/jonah_2_7.htm">7</a> Jehovah is in the temple of His holiness]. <a href="3927/habakkuk_2_20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a>.<p>The 'temple of the holiness' of Jehovah or the Lord is His Divine Human, for to that there is bowing down, looking, and praying, and not to the temple only, for this in itself is not holy. It is called 'the temple of holiness' because holiness is predicated of Divine Truth (<a href="173.htm">173</a>). By 'the temple that sanctifies the gold' (<a href="3927/matthew_23_16.htm">Matthew 23:16-17</a>) nothing else but the Lord's Divine Human is understood.</p><p>[2] That by 'temple' in a representative sense is signified the Lord's Church in heaven, is plain from these passages:<p>The voice of Jehovah out of the temple. <a href="3927/isaiah_66_6.htm">Isaiah 66:6</a>.<p>There came a great voice out of the temple of heaven. <a href="3927/revelation_16_17.htm">Revelation 16:17</a>.<p>The temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in the temple the ark of His covenant. <a href="3927/revelation_11_19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>.<p>The temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened; and the seven angels came out of the temple; and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God. <a href="3927/revelation_15_5.htm">Revelation 15:5-6</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_15_8.htm">8</a>.<p>I called upon Jehovah, and cried unto my God; He heard a voice out of His temple. <a href="3927/psalms_18_6.htm">Psalms 18:6</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_18_7.htm">7</a>].<p>I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple. <a href="3927/isaiah_6_1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>.</p><p>[3] That 'temple' signifies the Church in the world, is plain from these:<p>Our house of holiness is set on fire. <a href="3927/isaiah_64_11.htm">Isaiah 64:11</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/isaiah_64_10.htm">10</a>].<p>I will shake all the nations, that I may fill this house with glory; the glory of the latter house shall be greater than that of the former, <a href="3927/haggai_2_7.htm">Haggai 2:7</a>, <a href="3927/haggai_2_9.htm">9</a>.<p>The Church to be set up by the Lord is described by the 'new temple' in <a href="3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">Ezekiel 40</a> to <a href="3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">Ezekiel 48</a>; and is understood by the 'temple' that the angel was measuring (<a href="3927/revelation_11_1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>); as well as elsewhere (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2-4</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_9.htm">9-11</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_8_9.htm">Zechariah 8:9</a>).<p>The disciples approached Jesus to show Him the buildings of the temple, and Jesus said to them, Verily I say unto you, there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be demolished. <a href="3927/matthew_24_1.htm">Matthew 24:1-2</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_1.htm">Mark 13:1-5</a>; <a href="3927/luke_21_5.htm">Luke 21:5-7</a>.<p>Here by 'the temple' is signified the Church of the present day, and by its demolition so that there is 'not one stone upon another' is signified the end of that Church, that then there would not be any truth left. For when the disciples spoke with the Lord about the temple, the Lord foretold the successive states of that Church, even to its end, [that is to say, He spoke] of the consummation of the age, and by 'the consummation of the age' is understood its last time, which is today. This was represented by the temple's being destroyed from the foundations.</p><p>[4] The temple signifies these three, namely the Lord, the Church in heaven, and the Church in the world. Since these three make one, they cannot be separated; consequently one cannot be understood without the other. Therefore he who separates the Church in the world from the Church in heaven, and these from the Lord, is not in the truth (veritas). Because [something] concerning the Church in the world now follows (<a href="194.htm">194</a>), here by 'the temple' the Church in heaven is understood. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 191</h4><p>191. Will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, signifies that truths from good from the Lord, with those in whom they abide, sustain the Lord's church in heaven. By "temple" the church is signified, and by "the temple of my God," the Lord's church in heaven; hence it is evident, that by "pillar" is signified that which sustains the church and makes it firm, and this is the Divine truth of the Word. By "temple," in the supreme sense, the Lord is signified as to the Divine Human, in particular as to the Divine truth; but, in the representative sense, by "temple" is signified the Lord's church in heaven, and likewise the Lord's church in the world. That "temple," in the supreme sense signifies the Lord as to the Divine Human, and in particular as to the Divine truth, is evident from these passages:<p>Jesus said to the Jews, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up; He spoke of the temple of His body, (<a href="3927/john_2_19.htm">John 2:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_2_21.htm">21</a>).<p>I saw no temple in the New Jerusalem, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_22.htm">Revelation 21:22</a>).<p>Behold, the Lord shall suddenly come to His temple, and the angel of the covenant whom ye seek, (<a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>).<p>I will bow down towards the temple of Thy holiness, (<a href="3927/psalms_138_2.htm">Psalms 138:2</a>).<p>Yet I will again look to the temple of Thy holiness and my prayer shall come to Thee, to the temple of Thy holiness, (<a href="3927/jonah_2_4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a>, <a href="3927/jonah_2_7.htm">7</a>; <a href="3927/habakkuk_2_20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a>).<p>"The temple of holiness of Jehovah," or the Lord, is His Divine Human, for that is bowed down to, looked to, and prayed to, and not to the temple only, for the temple in itself is not holy.

The reason why the church in heaven is here meant by "the temple," is because the church in the world is treated of afterwards, (<a href="194.htm">194</a>[1-4]). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 191 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>191. "Faciam illum columnam in Templo Dei Mei," significat quod vera ex bono a Domino, apud quos sunt, sustentent Ecclesiam Domini in Caelo. - Per "Templum" significatur Ecclesia, et per "Templum Dei Mei" Ecclesia Domini in Caelo; inde patet quod per "Columnam" significetur id quod sustentat et firmat Ecclesiam, et hoc est Divinum Verum Verbi. Per "Templum" in supremo Sensu significatur Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum, in specie quoad Divinum Verum; in Sensu autem repraesentativo per" Templum" significatur Ecclesia Domini in Caelo; tum etiam Ecclesia Domini in Mundo. Quod per "Templum" in supremo Sensu significetur Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum, et in Specie quoad Divinum Verum, patet ex his locis: <p>Jesus dixit Judaeis, "Solvite Templum hoc, et in tribus diebus exsuscitabo illud; loquebatur de Templo Corporis Sui," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_191/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_2_19" target=_top>Johannes 2:19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_191/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_2_21" target=_top>21</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>"Templum non vidi" in Nova Hierosolyma," nam Dominus Deus Omnipotens Templum ejus et Agnus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_191/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_22" target=_top>Apocalypsis 21:22</a>);<p>"Ecce subito veniet ad Templum Suum Dominus, et Angelus foederis quem quaeritis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_191/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_malachi_3_1" target=_top>Malachias 3:1</a>);<p>"Incurvabo me versus Templum sanctitatis Tuae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_191/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_138_2" target=_top>Psalm 138:2</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>"Addam respicere ad Templum sanctitatis Tuae, et venit ad Te oratio mea, ad Templum sanctitatis Tuae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_191/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_2_5" target=_top>Johannes 2:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_191/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_2_8" target=_top>8</a>) (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_191/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_2_4" target=_top>4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_191/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_2_7" target=_top>7</a>);<p>("Jehovah in Templo sanctitatis Suae") (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_191/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_habakkuk_2_20" target=_top>Habakuk 2:20</a>);<p>"Templum sanctitatis Jehovae" seu Domini, est Divinum Humanum Ipsius, nam ad Hoc incurvatur, respicitur et oratur, et non ad solum templum, hoc enim in se non sanctum est; vocatur "Templum sanctitatis," quia sanctitas praedicatur de Divino Vero (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_191/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173" target=_top>173</a>). <sup>3</sup>Per "Templum quod sanctificat aurum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_191/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_23_16-17" target=_top>Matthaeus 23:16-17</a>), <p>nec aliud intelligitur quam Divinum Humanum Domini.
