<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第673节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>673.“盛满了活到万世万代之神烈怒的”表将被纯粹和真正的圣言真理和良善所显明并揭露的邪恶和虚假。经上之所以说这些香瓶“盛满了神的烈怒”，是因为它们装满了各样“灾”；“灾”表示教会的邪恶与虚假（<a href="657.htm">657</a>节）；但它们不只装满这些，还装满了来自圣言的纯粹和真正的真理和良善，教会的邪恶和虚假将被这些真理和良善所揭露；不过，它们并非盛有真理和良善的香瓶；而表示从天堂进入教会的流注。经上乃是照着圣言字义的风格说它们“盛满了神的烈怒”，这一点从上面所引用的经文明显看出来，其中“烈怒”和“愤怒”被归给了耶和华；然事实上，耶和华没有烈怒和愤怒，而是人对祂有。至于在字义上经上如此说的原因，可参看前文（<a href="525.htm">525</a>，<a href="535.htm">535</a>，<a href="658.htm">658</a>节）。由此明显可知，“盛满了活到万世万代之神烈怒的香瓶”表示教会的可怕邪恶和虚假，它们将被圣言的良善和真理显明并揭露出来。只有真理和良善才能揭露邪恶和虚假；因为真理和良善在天堂之光中，而虚假和邪恶则在地狱的黑暗中；在黑暗里没什么可暴露的，因为除了邪恶和虚假，那里什么也没有。而通过天堂而来的光，一切事物都暴露出来，因为在天堂之光中，一切事物都会显现出来；事实上，天堂之光就是主的神性智慧的神性真理。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 673</h4><p>673. Full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever. This symbolizes the evils and falsities that will be exposed to view by the pure and genuine truths and goods in the Word.<p>The bowls are said to have been full of the wrath of God because they were full of plagues, which symbolize evils and falsities in the church (no. <a href="657.htm">657</a>). Nevertheless they were not full of these, but were full of the pure and genuine truths and goods from the Word by which the evils and falsities in the church were exposed. Neither were there any actual bowls containing truths and goods, but they are symbols of an influx from heaven into the church. Their being said to be full of the wrath of the living God accords with the style of the Word in its literal sense, as may be seen from passages presented above in which we find anger and wrath attributed to God, even though no anger or wrath exists in Jehovah, but is found in man directed at Him. The reason that the literal sense speaks so may be seen in nos. <a href="525.htm">525</a>, <a href="635.htm">635</a>, <a href="658.htm">658</a> above.<p>It is apparent from this that the bowls full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever symbolize the grievous evils and falsities that will be exposed to view by the pure and genuine goods and truths in the Word. Evils and falsities are exposed to view only by truths and goods, as truths and goods exist in the light of heaven, while falsities and evils exist in the darkness of hell, and nothing is exposed in a state of darkness, because only evil and falsity are seen in it. But light from heaven exposes everything to view, because everything is seen in it; for the light of heaven is the Divine truth of the Lord's Divine wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 673</h4><p>673. 'Full of the wrath of the God living for ages of ages' signifies the evils and untruths about to appear and be disclosed by means of the pure and genuine truths and goods of the Word. It is said that the phials were 'full of the wrath of God' because they were full of 'plagues,' by which the evils and untruths of the Church are signified (<a href="657.htm">657</a>); but yet they were not full of these but were full of pure and genuine truths and goods out of the Word, by means of which the evils and untruths of the Church were disclosed. But still neither were there 'phials,' and in them truths and goods, but by them is signified an influx out of heaven into the Church. Their being said to be 'full of the wrath of the Living God' is in accordance with the style of the Word in the sense of its letter, as can be established from the passages adduced above in which there is ascribed to Jehovah 'wrath' and 'growing anger'; and yet Jehovah does not have wrath and growing anger, but a man has it against Him. The reason why it is so said in the sense of the letter may be seen above (<a href="525.htm">525</a>, <a href="635.htm">635</a>, <a href="658.htm">658</a>). From these considerations it is plain that by 'phials full of the wrath of the God living for ages of ages' is signified the dreadful evils and untruths of the Church about to appear and be disclosed by means of the goods and truths of the Word. Evils and untruths are disclosed in no other way than by means of truths and goods, for these are in the light of heaven, but untruths and evils are in the darkness of hell, and in the darkness nothing is discovered because nothing but evil and untruth appear there. But as a result of light out of heaven all things are disclosed, because they all appear in it. For the light of heaven is the Divine Truth of the Lord's Divine Wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 673</h4><p>673. Full of the anger of God that liveth for ages of ages, signifies the evils and falsities that are to appear and are to be exposed by the pure and genuine truths and goods of the Word. It is said that the vials were "full of the anger of God," because they were full of the plagues; by which are signified the evils and falsities of the church, (<a href="657.htm">657</a>); but still they were not full of these, but full of pure and genuine truths and goods from the Word, by which the evils and falsities of the church would be disclosed; but still they were not vials, with truths and goods in them; but by them the influx from heaven into the church was signified. It is according to the style of the Word in the sense of its letter, that they are said to be "full of the anger of the living God;" as may be evident from the passages adduced above, in which "anger" and "wrath" are ascribed to Jehovah; when yet Jehovah has no anger and wrath, but man has it against Him. The reason that it is so said in the sense of the letter, may be seen above, (<a href="525.htm">525</a>, <a href="635.htm">635</a>, <a href="658.htm">658</a>). From this it is manifest that by "the vials full of the anger of God that liveth for ages of ages," are signified the direful evils and falsities of the church that are to appear and be exposed by the goods and truths of the Word. Evils and falsities are exposed in no other way than by truths and goods; for these are in the light of heaven, but falsities and evils are in the darkness of hell; and in darkness nothing is exposed, because nothing but evil and falsity appears there. But by light from heaven all things are exposed, because in that all things appear; for the light of heaven is the Divine truth of the Lord's Divine wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 673 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>673. "Plenas ira Dei viventis in saecula saeculorum," significat mala et falsa apparitura et detegenda per pura et genuina vera et bona Verbi. -Dicitur quod phialae essent "plenae ira Dei," quia erant plenae plagis, per quas significantur mala et falsa Ecclesiae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_673/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_657" target=_top>657</a>); sed usque non erant plenae illis, sed erant plenae puris et genuinis veris et bonis ex Verbo, per quae detegerentur mala et falsa Ecclesiae; sed usque nec erant phialae et in illis vera et bona, sed per illas significatur influxus e Caelo in Ecclesiam; quod dicantur "plenae ira Dei viventis," est secundum stylum Verbi in Sensu literae ejus, ut constare potest ex locis adductis supra, in quibus adscribitur Jehovae "ira" et "excandescentia," et usque Jehovae nulla ira et excandescentia est, sed est homini contra Ipsum; causa quod in Sensu literae ita dicatur, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_673/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525" target=_top>525</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_673/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635" target=_top>635</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_673/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_658" target=_top>658</a>). Ex his patet, quod per "phialas plenas ira Dei viventis in saecula saeculorum" significentur dira mala et falsa Ecclesiae apparitura et detegenda per bona et vera Verbi. Mala et falsa nec aliter deteguntur quam per vera et bona, haec enim sunt in luce Caeli, at falsa et mala sunt in tenebris Inferni; et in tenebris nihil detegitur, quia non aliud quam malum et falsum ibi apparet; sed e luce e Caelo omnia deteguntur, quia in illa omnia apparent: lux Caeli enim est Divinum Verum Divinae Sapientiae Domini. </p>
