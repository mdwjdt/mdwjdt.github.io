<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第41节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>41.“即以弗所、士每拿、别迦摩、推雅推喇、撒狄、非拉铁非、老底嘉”表尤其照着各自的接受状态。在灵义上，这七个名字表示接受主及其教会的各种状态，这一点可见于下文。因为约翰受主嘱托时处于属灵的状态，在此状态下，凡以名字所提及的，无不表示某种事物或状态。因此，约翰所写的这些事不是真要寄给那些地方的任何教会，而是要告知教会的天使，就是那些乐意接受的人。整部圣言中的所有人名、地名无不表示属灵事物，这一点在出版于伦敦的《天堂的奥秘》一书多有说明。如那本书说明了“亚伯拉罕”、“以撒”、“雅各”表示什么；还有“以色列”和以色列十二个儿子的名字表示什么；以及迦南的各个地方和那地邻近地区的地方表示什么；“埃及”、“叙利亚”、“亚述”和其它地方又表示什么等等。这七个名字也一样。不过，情愿停留于字义的人也无妨，因为字义同样有结合之效，只要知道天使将这些名字理解为教会的事物和状态就好了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 41</h4><p>41. "Ephesus and Smyrna, Pergamum and Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea." This symbolically means, in every case according to each one's state of reception.<p>That these seven names symbolize, in the spiritual sense, all states of reception for the Lord and His church is something we will see below. For when John received this command, he was in a spiritual state, and in that state nothing is mentioned by name that does not symbolize some thing or state. Consequently the messages written by John were not sent to any church in those places, but were addressed to their angels, meaning people who receive.<p>That all names of places and persons throughout the Word have spiritual meanings is something we showed many times in Arcana Coelestia (The Secrets of Heaven), published in London. For example, the names of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, called also Israel, and the names of his twelve sons. The names also of various places in the land of Canaan, and of places round about that land, such as Egypt, Syria, Assyria, and more.<p>The same is the case with these seven names. However, for one who wishes to stay with the literal meaning, let him stay with it, because that meaning conjoins. Only let him know that by these names angels perceive matters and states having to do with the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 41</h4><p>41. 'Unto Ephesus and Smyrna, and Pergamum and Thyatira, and Sardis and Philadelphia, and Laodicea' signifies specifically in accordance with the state of reception of each one. That all the states of reception of the Lord and His Church are signified in the spiritual sense by those seven names will be seen below; for when this was enjoined on him, John was in a spiritual state, and in that state nothing is called by a name that does not signify a thing or a state. These things, therefore, that were written by John were not sent to any Church in those places, but were told to the angels of those Churches, by whom are understood those who receive. That spiritual things are understood by all the names of places and persons in the whole Word, has been shown many times in ARCANA CAELESTIA published at London; as what [is understood] by Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, also by Israel, and by the names of his twelve sons, as also what [is understood] by various places in the land of Canaan, and by places in the neighbourhood of that land, as Egypt, Syria, Assyria and other places. It is similar with these seven names. But let him who wishes to remain in the sense of the letter remain, because that sense conjoins. Only let him know that angels by means of those names perceive the things and states of the Church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 41</h4><p>41. Unto Ephesus, and Smyrna, and Pergamos, and Thyatira, and Sardis, and Philadelphia, and Laodicea, signifies in particular according to the state of reception of each. That all the states of reception of the Lord and of His church are signified by those seven names, in the spiritual sense, will be seen below; for John, when he received this command, was in a spiritual state, and in that state nothing is mentioned by name which does not signify some thing or state; therefore these things which were written by John, were not sent to any church in those places, but were told to their angels, by whom are meant those who receive. That by all the names of places and persons throughout the whole Word, are meant spiritual things, is shown in many places in Arcana Coelestia, published in London, as what is meant by "Abraham," "Isaac," and "Jacob;" also by "Israel," and by the names of his twelve sons; as also, what is meant by various places in the land of Canaan, and by places in the vicinity of that land; as what by Egypt, Syria, Assyria, and other places. It is the same with these seven names. But he who wishes to remain in the sense of the letter, let him remain, since that sense conjoins; only let him know, that by those names the angels perceive things and states of the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 41 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>41. "Ephesum, et Smyrnam, et Pergamum, et Thyatira, et Sardes, et Philadelphiam, et Laodiceam," significat in specie secundum statum receptionis cujusvis. Quod omnes status receptionis Domini et Ipsius Ecclesiae per Septem illa Nomina in Sensu spirituali significentur, videbitur infra: fuit enim Johannes, cum hoc illi mandatum est, in statu spirituali, et in illo statu non aliquid vocatur nomine quod non significat rem aut statum: quare nec a Johanne haec quae scripta sunt, ad aliquam Ecclesiam in illis locis missa sunt, sed dicta illarum Angelis, per quos intelliguntur qui recipiunt. Quod per omnia Nomina Locorum et Personarum in toto Verbo intelligantur res spirituales, multis ostensum est in Arcanis Caelestibus Londini editis, ut quid per "Abrahamum," "Isacum" et "Jacobum," tum per "Israelem," et per Nomina duodecim ejus filiorum; ut et quid per varia loca Terrae Canaanis, et per loca vicina Terrae isti, ut quid per Aegyptum, Syriam, Assyriam, et plura. Simile est cum septem his Nominibus. Sed qui vult manere in Sensu literae, maneat, quia ille Sensus conjungit; sciat modo, quod Angeli per illa Nomina res et status Ecclesiae percipiant. </p>
