<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>347.启7:3.“等我们在我们神众仆人的额上先盖上了印”表那些从主处于源自良善的真理，因而内在良善之人被分开之前。“在他们额上先盖上了印”并非真的在他们额上盖上印，而是指将那些从主处于爱之善的人区别并分开；因为“额”表示爱之善。之所以表示那些从主处于源自良善的真理之人，是因为“神的众仆人”就表示这些人（3节）。“额”之所以表示爱之善，是因为脸是人之情感的形像，而前额是脸的最高部位；人生命的一切事物都源于前额下的大脑。由于“额”表示爱，包括善人里面的善爱和恶人里面的恶爱，故“在他们额上先盖上了印”就表示照着爱而将彼此区别并分开。以西结书中的这段经文的含义也一样：</p><p>你去走遍耶路撒冷中间，那些所行可憎之事叹息哀哭的人，画记号在额上。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结9.4.htm">9:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结9.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>正因“额”表示爱，故关于亚伦冠冕上刻有“归耶和华为圣”的金牌，经上记着说：</p><p>将牌系在冠冕的前面，这牌必在亚伦的额上，这牌要常在他的额上，使他们可以在耶和华面前蒙悦纳。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.36.htm">28:36</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.38.htm">38</a>）</p><p>此外，经上还要求：</p><p>你要尽心、尽性爱神，这些话要系在手上，放在额上。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.5.htm">6:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.8.htm">8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.18.htm">11:18</a>）</p><p>他们的额上有父的名。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.1.htm">14:1</a>）</p><p>神和羔羊的名在他们额上。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.4.htm">22:4</a>）</p><p>要知道，主注视天使的前额，而他们则用眼睛注视主；这是因为主通过爱之善注视所有人，并愿意作为他们这一方，他们当通过智慧的真理注视祂；以这种方式实现结合。</p><p>在以下经文中，“额”在反面意义上表示恶爱：</p><p>他们额上有兽印。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.16.htm">13:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.9.htm">14:9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.4.htm">20:4</a>）</p><p>他们额上还有巴比伦的名。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.5.htm">17:5</a>）</p><p>淫妇的额。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.3.htm">3:3</a>）</p><p>额坚心硬。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.7.htm">3:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.8.htm">8</a>）</p><p>你是顽梗的，你的额是铜的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.4.htm">48:4</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 347</h4><p>347. "Till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads." This symbolically means, before those people were separated who were governed by truths springing from goodness from the Lord, thus who were inwardly good.<p>Sealing them on the foreheads does not mean to seal them there actually, but to distinguish and separate people who are impelled by the goodness of love from the Lord; for the forehead symbolizes the goodness of love. They are people who are governed by truths springing from goodness from the Lord, because these are the kind of people meant by servants of God (no. <a href="3.htm">3</a>).<p>The forehead symbolizes the goodness of love because the face images a person's affections, and the forehead is the highest part of the face. Just underneath the forehead is the brain, from which originates everything connected with the person's life.<p>Because the forehead symbolizes love - a good love in the case of good people, and an evil love in the case of evil people - therefore to seal them on the foreheads means, symbolically, to distinguish and separate one from the other according to their love.<p>The like is symbolically meant in Ezekiel:<p>Go through... the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men who groan... over... the abominations... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_9_4.htm">Ezekiel 9:4-6</a>)</p><p>[2] Since the forehead symbolizes love, therefore regarding the plate on Aaron's turban which had "Holiness to Jehovah" engraved on it, we read that it was on the front of the turban, so as to be on Aaron's forehead, and to be always on Aaron's forehead, that the people might find favor before Jehovah (<a href="3927/exodus_28_36.htm">Exodus 28:36-38</a>). And it was also commanded that the words, "You shall love your God with all your heart and with all your soul," be on the hand and on the forehead (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_6_5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_6_8.htm">8</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_11_18.htm">11:18</a>); that they have the name of the Father written on their foreheads (<a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>), and the name of God and of the Lamb on their foreheads (<a href="3927/revelation_22_4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>).<p>It should be known that the Lord views angels by looking upon their foreheads, and they in turn view the Lord with their eyes. The reason is that the Lord regards all in accordance with the goodness of their love, and wills that they in turn regard Him in accordance with the truths of wisdom, so as to bring about a conjunction.</p><p>[3] In an opposite sense the forehead in the following instances symbolizes an evil love: people who have the mark of the beast on their foreheads (<a href="3927/revelation_13_16.htm">Revelation 13:16</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_14_9.htm">14:9</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">20:4</a>); and also people with the name of Babylon on their foreheads (<a href="3927/revelation_17_5.htm">Revelation 17:5</a>). The forehead of a woman who is a harlot (<a href="3927/jeremiah_3_3.htm">Jeremiah 3:3</a>). People having an obstinate forehead and a hard heart (<a href="3927/ezekiel_3_7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7-8</a>).<p>...you were obstinate..., and your forehead was bronze... (<a href="3927/isaiah_48_4.htm">Isaiah 48:4</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 347</h4><p>347. 'Till we have sealed the servants of our God upon their foreheads' signifies before those have been separated who are in truths out of good from the Lord, thus those who are interiorly good. By 'to seal upon the foreheads' is not understood to seal them there, but to distinguish and separate those who are in the good of love from the Lord; for the 'forehead' signifies the good of love. The reason it is those who are in truths out of good from the Lord is because they are understood by 'the servants of God' (<a href="3.htm">3</a>). 'Forehead' signifies good of love because the face is the image of a man's affections, and the forehead is the highest part of the face. The cerebrum, out of which is the beginning of all the things of a man's life, is immediately beneath the forehead. As the 'forehead' signifies love, a love of good with the good, and a love of evil with the evil, therefore by 'to seal upon the forehead' is signified to distinguish and separate one from the other in accordance with the love. The like is signified in Ezekiel:<p>Pass through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a seal upon the foreheads of those sighing over the abominations. <a href="3927/ezekiel_9_4.htm">Ezekiel 9:4-6</a>.</p><p>[2] Since 'forehead' signifies love, it is therefore said of the plate upon Aaron's mitre, upon which HOLINESS TO JEHOVAH was engraved:<p>That it was to be out of the region of the faces of his mitre, so that it might be upon Aaron's forehead, and be upon Aaron's forehead continually, to cause him <sup>1</sup>to be well-pleasing before Jehovah, <a href="3927/exodus_28_36.htm">Exodus 28:36-38</a>.<p>And moreover it was commanded:<p>That the words, Thou shalt love thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, may be upon hand and forehead. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_6_5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_6_8.htm">8</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_11_18.htm">11:18</a>.<p>That they should have the Father's Name written upon their forehead. <a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>.<p>And the Name of God and the Lamb in their forehead. <a href="3927/revelation_22_4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>.<p>It is to be known that the Lord looks at angels in their foreheads, and they in turn look at the Lord through their eyes. This is because the Lord views all out of the good of love, whilst wishing that they in turn may view Him out of truths of wisdom, thus that there may be a conjunction.</p><p>[3] By 'forehead' in the opposite sense a love of evil is signified, in these [statements]:<p>Who have the mark of the beast upon their forehead. <a href="3927/revelation_13_16.htm">Revelation 13:16</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_14_9.htm">14:9</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">20:4</a>.<p>And also the name of Babylon upon their forehead. <a href="3927/revelation_12_5.htm">Revelation 12:5</a>.<p>The forehead of a woman, a harlot. <a href="3927/jeremiah_3_3.htm">Jeremiah 3:3</a>.<p>Stubborn of forehead, and hard of heart. <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7-8</a>.<p>Thou art hard, and thy forehead bronzed. <a href="3927/isaiah_48_4.htm">Isaiah 48:4</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 347</h4><p>347. Till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads, signifies before they are separated who are in truths from good from the Lord, thus who are interiorly good. By "sealing them in their foreheads," is not meant to seal them there, but to distinguish and separate those who are in the good of love from the Lord; for "the forehead" signifies the good of love. That they who are in truths from good from the Lord are meant, because these are signified by "the servants of God" (<a href="3.htm">3</a>[1-3]). The reason why "the forehead" signifies the good of love, is, because the face is the image of man's affections, and the forehead is the highest part of the face; the cerebrum, from which is the origin of all things of man's life, being immediately under the forehead. As "the forehead" signifies the love, good love in the good, and evil love in the evil, therefore by "sealing them on their foreheads," is signified to distinguish and separate one from another according to the love. Similar is the signification of this passage in Ezekiel:<p>Go through the midst of Jerusalem, and seal a seal upon the foreheads of the men that sigh over the abominations, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_9_4.htm">Ezekiel 9:4-6</a>).</p><p>[2] As "the forehead" signifies love, therefore concerning the plate of gold on the mitre of Aaron, on which was engraven Holiness to Jehovah, it is written:<p>That it should be over against the face of his mitre, that it might be over the forehead of Aaron, and that it should be upon the forehead of Aaron continually, that they may be in good favor before Jehovah, (<a href="3927/exodus_28_36.htm">Exodus 28:36-38</a>).<p>And moreover it was commanded:<p>That these words, Thou shalt love God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, were to be upon the hand and upon the forehead, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_6_5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_6_8.htm">8</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_11_18.htm">11:18</a>).<p>That they should have the name of the Father written on their foreheads, (<a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>).<p>And the name of God and of the Lamb in their foreheads, (<a href="3927/revelation_22_4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>).<p>It should be known, that the Lord looks at the angels in the forehead, whilst they look at the Lord through the eyes; by reason that the Lord looks at all from the good of love, and wills that they, on their part, should look at Him from the truths of wisdom; in this manner conjunction is effected.</p><p>[3] "The forehead," in the opposite sense, signifies evil love in these passages:<p>Who have the mark of the beast on their forehead, (<a href="3927/revelation_13_16.htm">Revelation 13:16</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_14_9.htm">14:9</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">20:4</a>).<p>And also the name of Babylon upon their foreheads, (<a href="3927/revelation_17_5.htm">Revelation 17:5</a>).<p>The forehead of a woman a harlot, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_3_3.htm">Jeremiah 3:3</a>).<p>Obdurate of forehead, and hard of heart, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_3_7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7-8</a>.<p>Thou art hard, and thy forehead is brass, (<a href="3927/isaiah_48_4.htm">Isaiah 48:4</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 347 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>347. "Usque dum signaverimus servos Dei nostri super frontibus illorum" significat antequam separati sunt qui in veris ex bono a Domino sunt, ita qui interius boni sunt. - Per "signare super frontibus" non intelligitur signare illos ibi, sed distinguere et separare illos qui in bono amoris a Domino sunt; "frons" enim significat bonum amoris: quod sint illi qui in veris ex bono a Domino sunt, est quia illi per "servos Dei" intelliguntur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_347/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_3" target=_top>3</a>). Quod "frons" significet bonum amoris, est quia facies est imago affectionum hominis, et frons est suprema pars faciei; cerebrum, ex quo origo omnium vitae hominis est, sub fronte est proxime. Quia "frons" significat amorem, apud bonos amorem bonum, et apud malos amorem malum, ideo per "signare super frontibus" significatur distinguere et separare unum ab altero secundum amorem: simile significatur apud Ezechielem: <p>"Transi per medium Hierosolymae, et Signa Signum super frontibus gementium super abominationes," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_347/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_9_4-6" target=_top>9:4-6</a>).<p>Quoniam "frons" significat amorem, ideo de bractea super Cidari Aharonis, super qua sculptum erat Sanctitas Jehovae, dicitur, <p>Quod esset e regione facierum Cidaris ejus, ut sit super Fronte Aharonis, sitque super Fronte Aharonis jugiter in beneplacitum illi coram Jehovah, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_347/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_28_36-38" target=_top>Exodus 28:36-38</a>);<p>et quoque mandatum est, <p>Ut haec verba, "Amabis Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo, et ex tota anima tua," sint super manu, et super Fronte, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_347/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_6_5" target=_top>Deuteronomius 6:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_347/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_6_8" target=_top>8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_347/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_11_18" target=_top>11:18</a>);<p>Quod haberent Nomen Patris scriptum super Frontibus, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_347/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_14_1" target=_top>Apocalypsis 14:1</a>);<p>Et Nomen Dei et Agni in Frontibus, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_347/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_22_4" target=_top>Apocalypsis 22:4</a>).<p>Sciendum est, quod Dominus inspiciat Angelos in frontibus, et illi vicissim Dominum per oculos; ex causa, quia Dominus aspicit omnes ex bono amoris, ac vult ut illi vicissim aspiciant Ipsum ex veris sapientiae; ita fit conjunctio. Per "frontem" in opposito sensu significatur amor malus, in his: <p>"Qui habent characterem bestiae super Frontibus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_347/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_13_16" target=_top>Apocalypsis 13:16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_347/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_14_9" target=_top>14:9</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_347/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_4" target=_top>20:4</a>);<p>Et quoque "nomen Babylonis super Frontibus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_347/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_17_5" target=_top>Apocalypsis 17:5</a>);<p>"Frons mulieris meretricis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_347/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_3_3" target=_top>Jeremias 3:3</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>"Obfirmati Fronte, et duri corde," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_347/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_3_7-8" target=_top>Ezechiel 3:7-8</a>);<p>"Durus tu, et Frons tua aenea," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_347/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_48_4" target=_top>Esaias 48:4</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;3 pro "4" </p>
