<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>213.“叫你赤身的羞耻不露出来”表免得属天之爱的良善遭到亵渎和玷污。没有人能知道“赤身的羞耻”表示什么，除非他知道两性生殖器官，也就是所谓的生殖器，对应于属天之爱。人及其所有部位与天堂存在一种对应关系，这一事实可见于1758年于伦敦出版的《天堂与地狱》（<a href="../hh/87.htm">87</a>-102节）一书；生殖器官对应于属天之爱，可参看也于伦敦出版的《天堂的奥秘》（<a href="../ac/5050.htm">5050</a>-<a href="../ac/5062.htm">5062</a>节）一书。由于这些部位对应于属天之爱，也就是第三层或至内层天堂的爱，而人从父母生在与此爱相对立的爱中，所以很明显，人若不从主为自己获取“火炼的金子”所表示的爱之良善和“白衣”所表示的智慧之真理，就会显现在对立的爱，也就是亵渎中。</p><p>在以下经文中，“露出赤体”和“揭开羞耻”即是此义：</p><p>那看守衣服、免得赤身而行，叫人见他羞耻的有福了！（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.15.htm">16:15</a>）</p><p>巴比伦和迦勒底的女儿坐在地上；掀起长裙，露出大腿，趟过江河；你的赤体必被露出，你的羞耻必被看见。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.1.htm">47:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.3.htm">3</a>）、</p><p>祸哉！这流人血的城，都因她多有淫行。我必揭起你的衣襟，蒙在你脸上，使列族看见你的赤体，使列国观看你的羞耻。（那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿 3.1.htm"> 3:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿 3.4.htm">4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿 3.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p>你们要与你们的母亲大大争辩，免得我使她赤体。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.2.htm">2:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.3.htm">3</a>）</p><p>我从你旁边经过，遮盖你的赤体，用水洗你，给你穿衣；但是你行邪淫；并未追念你幼年赤身露体的日子；所以，你已露出你的赤体。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.6.htm">16:6</a>等）</p><p>耶路撒冷大大犯罪，因此所有人都讥讽她，因为他们见到她的裸体。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.8.htm">1:8</a>）</p><p>这些事都是指着“耶路撒冷”说，“耶路撒冷”表教会，“行邪淫”表玷污、歪曲圣言（<a href="134.htm">134</a>节）。</p><p>给同伴酒喝，使他喝醉，好看见他裸体的，有祸了。你也喝吧，显出是未受割礼的。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.15.htm">2:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.16.htm">16</a>）</p><p>人若知道“赤身”（nakedness或译赤体，裸体，下体）是什么意思，就能明白以下经文是什么意思：</p><p>挪亚喝了酒，喝醉了，在帐棚中间赤着身子。含看见他赤身就取笑，而闪和雅弗则背着脸遮盖父亲的赤身，免得看见。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创9.21.htm">9:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创9.23.htm">23</a>）</p><p>也就明白经上为何规定：</p><p>亚伦和他儿子上祭坛，不可用台阶，免得露出下体来。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出20.26.htm">20:26</a>）</p><p>还有：</p><p>要给他们作细麻布裤子，遮盖裸体，他们挨近祭坛的时候要穿上，免得担罪而死。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.42.htm">28:42</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.43.htm">43</a>）</p><p>在这些经文中，“赤身”（或赤体，裸体，下体）表人与生俱来的各种邪恶，这些邪恶因与属天之爱的良善相对立，故本身是亵渎的，若不通过真理和照之的生活，就无法被除去。“细麻布”也表真理（<a href="671.htm">671</a>节）。</p><p>“赤身”还表示纯真，同样表对良善和真理的无知。在以下经文中，“赤身”表纯真：</p><p>男人和他妻子都赤身露体，并不羞耻。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创2.25.htm">2:25</a>）</p><p>在以下经文中，“赤身”表对良善和真理的无知：</p><p>这是我所拣选的禁食；要把你的饼分给饥饿的人，见赤身的给他遮身。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.6.htm">58:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.7.htm">7</a>）</p><p>将自己的食物给了饥饿的人，将衣服给赤身裸体的人遮身。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结18.7.htm">18:7</a>）</p><p>我饿了，你们给我吃；我赤身露体，你们给我穿。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.35.htm">25:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.36.htm">36</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 213</h4><p>213. "'That the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed.'" This symbolically means, so as not to profane and adulterate the goodness of heavenly love.<p>No one can know the symbolic meaning of the shame of nakedness unless he knows that the reproductive organs in both sexes, called also the genitalia, correspond to celestial love.<p>To be shown that the human body and all its constituents have a correspondence with the heavens, see the book Heaven and Hell, published in London in , nos. <a href="../hh/87.htm">87-102</a>. And to be shown that the reproductive organs correspond to celestial love, see Arcana Coelestia (The Secrets of Heaven), also published in London, nos. <a href="../ac/5050.htm">5050</a>-<a href="../ac/5062.htm">5062</a>.<p>Now because these organs correspond to celestial love, which is the love found in the third or inmost heaven, and because a person is born of his parents into loves contrary to that love, it is apparent that if he does not acquire for himself the goodness of love and the truth of wisdom from the Lord, which are symbolically meant by gold refined in fire and white garments, he will be seen to be impelled by a contrary love, which in itself is profane.</p><p>[2] This latter circumstance is symbolically meant by uncovering nakedness and manifesting the shame of it, in the following places:<p>Blessed is he who watches and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and his private parts be seen. (<a href="3927/revelation_16_15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>)<p>...daughter of Babylon (and of the Chaldeans), sit on the ground... Uncover your hair..., uncover the thigh, pass through the rivers. Let your nakedness be uncovered; yes, let your shame be seen. (<a href="3927/isaiah_47_1.htm">Isaiah 47:1-3</a>)<p>Woe to the bloody city! ...Because of the multitude of (her) harlotries... I will uncover your skirts in front of you, and I will show the nations your nakedness, and the kingdoms your disgrace. (<a href="3927/nahum_3_1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>, <a href="3927/nahum_3_4.htm">4-5</a>)<p>Contend with your mother... lest I strip her naked... (<a href="3927/hosea_2_2.htm">Hosea 2:2-4</a>)<p>When I passed by you... I covered your nakedness... Then I washed you... and... I clothed you... But you... played the harlot... not remembering your youth, when you were naked and bare... (Therefore) your nakedness was uncovered... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_16_6.htm">Ezekiel 16:6</a>ff.)<p>Jerusalem has sinned gravely; therefore... all... despise her, because they have seen her nakedness. (<a href="3927/lamentations_1_8.htm">Lamentations 1:8</a>)<p>Jerusalem, of which these things were said, means the church; and to play the harlot means, symbolically, to adulterate and falsify the Word (no. <a href="134.htm">134</a>).<p>Woe to him who makes his neighbor drink..., making him drunk, that you may look on his nakedness! ...Drink, you too, that your uncircumcised foreskin may be exposed! (<a href="3927/habakkuk_2_15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15-16</a>)</p><p>[3] Someone who knows what nakedness symbolizes can understand what is symbolically meant by the statement that when Noah was drunk from drinking wine he lay uncovered inside his tent, and Ham saw and laughed at his nakedness, but Shem and Japheth covered his nakedness, turning their faces away so as not to see it (<a href="3927/genesis_9_21.htm">Genesis 9:21-23</a>). He can understand also why it was decreed that Aaron and his sons should not go up by steps to the altar, that their nakedness might not be exposed (<a href="3927/exodus_20_26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a>). And so, too, why it was decreed that they should make for them linen trousers to cover their naked flesh, that they should have these on when they came near the altar, and that otherwise they would bear their iniquity and die (<a href="3927/exodus_28_42.htm">Exodus 28:42-43</a>).<p>Nakedness in these places symbolizes the evils into which a person is born, which, because they are contrary to the goodness of celestial love, are in themselves profane and are removed only by truths and by living in accordance with those truths. Linen also symbolizes truth (no. <a href="671.htm">671</a>[1-2]).</p><p>[4] Nakedness in addition symbolizes innocence, and also ignorance of goodness and truth. Innocence is symbolized by the statement, "they were both naked, the man and his wife, and they had no cause for shame" (<a href="3927/genesis_2_25.htm">Genesis 2:25</a>). Ignorance of goodness and truth is symbolized by the following:<p>...this... fast that I choose: ...to break bread with the hungry..., and... when you see the naked man, to cover him. (<a href="3927/isaiah_58_6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>)<p>He gives his bread to the hungry man, and covers the naked one with clothing. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_18_7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>)<p>...I was hungry and you gave Me food...; I was naked and you clothed Me. (<a href="3927/matthew_25_35.htm">Matthew 25:35-36</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 213</h4><p>213. 'And the shame of thy nakedness may not appear' signifies so that the good of celestial love may not be profaned and adulterated. No one can know what 'the shame of nakedness' signifies, unless he knows that the organs (membra) of generation in each sex, which are also called the genitals, correspond to celestial love. That there is a correspondence of man and all his members with heaven, may be seen in the work concerning HEAVEN AND HELL, published at London in the year 1758 (<a href="87.htm">87-102</a>); and that the genital organs (membra) correspond to celestial love, in ARCANA CAELESTIA, also published at London (<a href="../ac/5050.htm">Arcana Coelestia 5050-5062</a>). Since those organs (membra) correspond to celestial love, which is the love of the third or inmost heaven, and a man from his parents is born into loves opposite to that love, it is plain that if he does not acquire for himself from the Lord the good of love and the truths of wisdom, which are signified by 'gold tried in the fire' and by 'white garments,' he will make his appearance in the opposite love, which in itself is profane.</p><p>[2] This is signified by 'uncovering nakedness' and 'making one's shame visible' in the following places:<p>Blessed is he who is awake and takes care of his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. <a href="3927/revelation_16_15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>.<p>Daughter of Babel and of Chaldea, sit on the earth, uncover thy hair, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers, let thy nakedness be revealed, and let thy reproach also be seen. <a href="3927/isaiah_47_1.htm">Isaiah 47:1-3</a>.<p>Woe to the city of bloods; because of the multitude of her whoredoms, I will uncover the extremities upon thy faces, and I will show the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy disgrace, <a href="3927/nahum_3_1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>, <a href="3927/nahum_3_4.htm">4-5</a>.<p>Plead with your mother, lest perchance I lay her naked, <a href="3927/hosea_2_2.htm">Hosea 2:2-4</a>.<p>When I have passed by thee, I have covered thy nakedness, and washed thee, and clothed thee, but then thou hast committed whoredom, not remembering thy youth, when thou wast naked and stripped bare; on that account thy nakedness has been revealed. <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_6.htm">Ezekiel 16:6</a> seq.<p>Jerusalem has sinned a sin, therefore all despise her, because they have seen her nakedness. <a href="3927/lamentations_1_8.htm">Lamentations 1:8</a>.<p>By 'Jerusalem,' of which these things have been said, the Church is understood; and by 'to commit whoredom' is signified to adulterate and falsify the Word (<a href="134.htm">134</a>).<p>Woe to him who makes his companion drink, making him drunken, that thou mayest look upon his nakedness: drink thou also that thy foreskin may be revealed, <a href="3927/habakkuk_2_15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15-16</a>.</p><p>[3] He who knows what 'nakedness' signifies is able to understand what is signified by [the statement] that:<p>Noah, when drunk from wine, was lying naked in the midst of his tent, and Ham saw and laughed at his nakedness, and Shem and Japheth covered his nakedness, turning away their faces lest they should see it. <a href="3927/genesis_9_21.htm">Genesis 9:21-23</a>.<p>And why it was commanded that:<p>Aaron and his sons should not go up by steps upon the altar, lest their nakedness should be revealed, <a href="3927/exodus_20_26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/exodus_20_23.htm">23</a>] as also that:<p>They should make for them linen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness, and they should be upon them when they were coming near the altar, and that otherwise they should bear iniquity and die, <a href="3927/exodus_28_42.htm">Exodus 28:42-43</a>.<p>By 'nakedness' in these passages the evils into which man is born are signified, which, because they are opposed to the good of celestial love, are in themselves profane, and are not removed except by means of truths and a life in accordance with them. 'Linen' also signifies truth (<a href="671.htm">671</a>). INNOCENCE also is signified by 'nakedness,' and also IGNORANCE or GOOD AND TRUTH; innocence by these [words]:<p>They were both naked, the man and his wife, and had no cause for shame. <a href="3927/genesis_2_25.htm">Genesis 2:25</a>.<p>Ignorance of good and truth by these:<p>This is the fast that I choose, to break bread to the hungry, and when thou seest the naked, to cover him. <a href="3927/isaiah_58_6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>.<p>Let him give his bread to the hungry, and cover the naked with a garment. <a href="3927/ezekiel_18_7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>.<p>I was hungry and you gave Me to eat, naked and you clothed Me. <a href="3927/matthew_25_35.htm">Matthew 25:35-36</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 213</h4><p>213. That the shame of thy nakedness may not appear, signifies lest the good of celestial love should be profaned and adulterated. No one can know what "the shame of nakedness" signifies, unless he knows that the members of generation in both sexes, which are also called the genitals, correspond to celestial love. That there is a correspondence of man and all his members with the heavens, may be seen in the work concerning Heaven and Hell, published in London in the year 1758 (<a href="87.htm">87-102</a>); and that the genital members correspond to celestial love, in The Arcana Coelestia, also published in London, (<a href="../ac/5050.htm">5050-5062</a>). As those members correspond to celestial love, which is the love of the third or inmost heaven, and man is born from his parents in loves which are opposite to that love, it is evident, that if he does not acquire to himself the good of love and the truth of wisdom from the Lord, signified by "gold tried in the fire," and by "white garments," he will appear in the opposite love, which is profane.</p><p>[2] This is signified by "uncovering nakedness" and "revealing shame," in the following passages:<p>Happy is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame, (<a href="3927/revelation_16_15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>)<p>Daughter of Babylon and of Chaldea, sit on the earth; uncover thy locks, uncover the thigh, pass over the stream; let thy nakedness be uncovered, and let thy reproach also be seen, (<a href="3927/isaiah_47_1.htm">Isaiah 47:1-3</a>).<p>Woe to the city of bloods, because of the multitude of her whoredoms: I will uncover the skirts upon thy face, and will show the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy disgrace, (<a href="3927/nahum_3_1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>, <a href="3927/nahum_3_4.htm">4-5</a>).<p>Contend with your mother, lest perchance I set her naked, (<a href="3927/hosea_2_2.htm">Hosea 2:2-3</a>).<p>When I passed by thee, I covered thy nakedness, and washed thee, and clothed thee; but thou committedst whoredom; not recollecting thy youth, when thou wast naked and stripped bare; therefore thou hast revealed thy nakedness, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_16_6.htm">Ezekiel 16:6</a> seq.).<p>Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore all speak ill of her, because they saw her nakedness, (<a href="3927/lamentations_1_8.htm">Lamentations 1:8</a>).<p>By "Jerusalem," of which these things are said, the church is meant; and by "committing whoredom" is signified to adulterate and falsify the Word, (<a href="134.htm">134</a>).<p>Woe to him that maketh his companion drink, making him drunk, that thou mayest look upon his nakedness: drink also thyself, that thy foreskin may be uncovered, (<a href="3927/habakkuk_2_15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15-16</a>).</p><p>[3] He who knows what "nakedness" signifies can understand what is signified by:<p>Noah, when drunken with wine lay naked in the midst of his tent, and Ham saw and laughed at his nakedness, and Shem and Japheth covered his nakedness, turning away their faces lest they should see it, (<a href="3927/genesis_9_21.htm">Genesis 9:21-23</a>).<p>Also why it was ordained that:<p>Aaron and his sons should not go up by steps upon the altar, lest their nakedness should be uncovered, (<a href="3927/exodus_20_26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a>).<p>As also that:<p>They should make for them breeches of linen to cover the flesh of nakedness, and that they should be upon them when they approached to the altar, and that otherwise they should carry their iniquity, and should die, (<a href="3927/exodus_28_42.htm">Exodus 28:42-43</a>).<p>By "nakedness" in these passages are signified the evils into which a man is born, which, because they are opposite to the good of celestial love, are in themselves profane; which are not removed except by truths, and by a life according to them: "linen" also signifies truth, (<a href="671.htm">671</a>).</p><p>[4] By "nakedness" is also signified innocence, and likewise ignorance of good and truth; innocence in the passage:<p>They were both naked, the man and his wife, and had no cause for shame, (<a href="3927/genesis_2_25.htm">Genesis 2:25</a>).<p>Ignorance of good and truth by these:<p>This is the fast which I choose; to break bread to the hungry; and when thou seest the naked, to cover him, (<a href="3927/isaiah_58_6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>).<p>Let him give his bread to the hungry, and cover the naked with a garment, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_18_7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>).<p>I hungered, and ye gave Me to eat; I was naked, and ye clothed Me, (<a href="3927/matthew_25_35.htm">Matthew 25:35-36</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 213 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>213. "Ne appareat pudor nuditatis tuae," significat ne prophanetur et adulteretur bonum amoris caelestis. - Nemo scire potest, quid significat "pudor nuditatis," nisi qui scit, quod membra generationis in utroque sexu, quae etiam genitalia vocantur, correspondeant amori caelesti: quod correspondentia hominis et omnium membrorum ejus sit cum Caelis, videatur in Opere de Caelo et Inferno Londini anno 1758 edito (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_213/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_87" target=_top>87-102</a>); et quod membra genitalia correspondeant amori caelesti, in Arcanis Caelestibus etiam Londini editis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_213/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_5050" target=_top>5050-5062</a>). Nunc quia illa membra correspondent amori caelesti, qui est amor tertii seu intimi Caeli, et homo nascitur a parentibus in amores illi amori oppositos, patet quod si non comparat Sibi a Domino bonum amoris et verum sapientiae, quae significantur per "aurum exploratum igne," et per "vestimenta alba," appariturus sit in amore opposito, qui in se est prophanus.
