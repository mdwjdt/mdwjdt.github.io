<p>803.启19:1.“这些事以后，我听见天上好像有一大群人的声音，说，哈利路亚”表低层天堂天使因着巴比伦人被移除而对主的感恩、称谢和颂扬。“天上一大群人”表示低层天堂的天使；“大声说，哈利路亚”表示他们对主的感恩、称谢和颂扬；在希伯亚语，“哈利路亚”表示你要赞美神，因此，这是一个发自内心的喜乐而对主的感恩、称谢和颂扬的词；这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>我的灵魂哪，要赞美耶和华。哈利路亚。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.35.htm">104:35</a>）</p><p>耶和华以色列的神是应当称颂的，从亘古直到永远；愿众民都说，阿们。哈利路亚。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗106.48.htm">106:48</a>）</p><p>我们要称颂耶和华，从今时直到永远。哈利路亚。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗115.18.htm">115:18</a>）</p><p>一切灵魂都要赞美耶和华。哈利路亚。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗150.6.htm">150:6</a>）</p><p>此外还有其它地方（如诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.45.htm">105:45</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗106.1.htm">106:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗111.1.htm">111:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗112.1.htm">112:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗113.1.htm">113:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗113.9.htm">9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗116.19.htm">116:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗117.2.htm">117:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗135.3.htm">135:3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.1.htm">148:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.14.htm">14</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗149.1.htm">149:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗149.9.htm">9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗150.1.htm">150:1</a>）。从论述处巴比伦人的前一章明显可知，这是由于巴比伦人被弃绝了；因此，经上说“这些事以后”，这一点还可从本章接下来的经文（2，3节）看出来。“一大群人”是指低层天堂的天使，这一点从本章第4节经文明显可知，在那里，经上说“那二十四位长老与四活物就俯伏敬拜坐宝座的神，说，阿们！哈利路亚”，而“二十四位长老和四活物”是指高层天堂的天使。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 803</h4><p>803. REVELATION: CHAPTER 19<p>1. After these things I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, "Alleluia! Salvation and glory and honor and power to the Lord our God! <p>2. For true and just are His judgments, because He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her licentiousness, and He has avenged the blood of His servants shed by her hand." <p>3. And a second time they said, "Alleluia! Her smoke rises up forever and ever!" <p>4. And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sat on the throne, saying, "Amen! Alleluia!" <p>5. Then a voice came from the throne, saying, "Praise our God, all you His servants and those who fear Him, both small and great!" <p>6. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as it were the sound of many waters and as it were the sound of mighty thunderings, saying, "Alleluia! For the Lord God Omnipotent reigns! <p>7. Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready." <p>8. And it was granted her to be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. <p>9. Then he said to me, "Write: 'Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb!' " And he said, "These are the true sayings of God." <p>10. And I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, "See that you do not do this! I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."<p>11. Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sat on it was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and does combat. <p>12. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many jewels. <sup>1</sup>He had a name written that no one knew but Himself. <p>13. He was clothed with a garment stained with blood, and His name is called "The Word of God." <p>14. And the hosts in heaven followed Him on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. <p>15. Out of His mouth went forth a sharp sword, that with it He might strike the nations, and He will shepherd them with a rod of iron. He treads the winepress of the fury and wrath of Almighty God. <p>16. And He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written: "King of kings and Lord of lords."<p>17. Then I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, "Come and gather together for the supper of the great God, <p>18. that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, both small and great." <p>19. And I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army. <p>20. Then the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who worked signs in its presence, by which he led astray those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone. <p>21. And the rest were slain with the sword of Him who sat on the horse, which went forth from His mouth. And all the birds were filled with their flesh.<p>THE SPIRITUAL MEANING<p>The Contents of the Whole Chapter<p>A glorification of the Lord by angels in heaven, because the Roman Catholic religion in the spiritual world has been removed, in consequence of which the angels have come into a state of light and into their bliss (verses <a href="3927/revelation_19_1.htm">1-5</a>). An annunciation of the Lord's advent and of a new church from Him (verses <a href="3927/revelation_19_6.htm">6-10</a>). The opening of the Word in its spiritual sense for that church (verses <a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">11-16</a>). An invitation of all people to it (verses <a href="3927/revelation_19_17.htm">17</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_18.htm">18</a>). The resistance of those caught up in a faith divorced from charity (verse 19). Their removal and damnation (verses <a href="3927/revelation_19_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_21.htm">21</a>).<p>The Contents of the Individual Verses:<p></p><table><thead><tr><th>Verse Contents</th><th>Spiritual Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. After these things I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, "Alleluia!</td><td>A thanksgiving, confession, and celebration of the Lord by angels of the lower heavens because of the Roman Catholics' removal.</td></tr><tr><td>Salvation and glory and honor and power to the Lord our God!</td><td>Salvation by the Lord now possible because a reception of Divine truth and goodness now possible in consequence of His Divine power,</td></tr><tr><td>2.

And a second time they said, "Alleluia! Her smoke rises up forever and ever!"</td><td>A thanksgiving and celebration of the Lord with joy, that that profane religion has been damned to eternity.</td></tr><tr><td>4. And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sat on the throne, saying, "Amen! Alleluia!"</td><td>An adoration of the Lord as God of heaven and earth and judge of the universe by angels of the higher heavens, and an affirmation by them of the thanksgiving, confession and celebration of the Lord made by angels of the lower heavens.</td></tr><tr><td>5. Then a voice came from the throne, saying, "Praise our God, all you His servants and those who fear Him,</td><td>An influx from the Lord into heaven and a consequent accord on the part of angels that all those prompted by truths of faith and goods of love worship the Lord as the only God of heaven,</td></tr><tr><td>both small and great!"</td><td>who to a lesser or greater degree are moved by truths of faith or goods of love to worship the Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>6. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as it were the sound of many waters and as it were the sound of mighty thunderings, saying, "Alleluia! For the Lord God Omnipotent reigns!</td><td>The joy of angels of the lowest, intermediate and highest heavens that the Lord alone will reign in the church that is now to come.</td></tr><tr><td>7. Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come,</td><td>Their joy of soul and heart and consequent glorification of the Lord, that from now on a full marriage of the Lord with the church is possible.</td></tr><tr><td>and His wife has made herself ready."</td><td>Those who will belong to this church, namely, the New Jerusalem, are being gathered together, introduced to it, and instructed.</td></tr><tr><td>8. And it was granted her to be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright,</td><td>They are being instructed through the Word by the Lord in truths that are genuine and pure.</td></tr><tr><td>for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.</td><td>Through truths from the Word those who are of the Lord's church live good lives.</td></tr><tr><td>9. Then he said to me, "Write: 'Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb!'"</td><td>A single angel sent from heaven to John and speaking with him about the Lord's New Church, saying that it was granted people on earth to know that those have eternal life who accept the teachings that are the teachings of that church.</td></tr><tr><td>And he said, "These are the true sayings of God."</td><td>This should be believed because it comes from the Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>10. And I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, "See that you do not do this! I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God!</td><td>Angels in heaven are not to be worshiped or invoked, because they have nothing Divine in them, but are associated, as brethren with brethren, with those people who worship the Lord, and therefore the Lord alone is to be worshiped in association with them.</td></tr><tr><td>For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."</td><td>An acknowledgment that the Lord is God of heaven and earth, and at the same time a life in accordance with His commandments, is in a universal sense the whole of the Word and of doctrine drawn from it.</td></tr><tr><td>11. Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse,</td><td>The spiritual sense of the Word revealed by the Lord and the deeper meaning of the Word thereby disclosed, which is the coming of the Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>and He who sat on it was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and does combat.</td><td>The Lord in relation to the Word, as being Divine good itself and Divine truth itself, who exercises judgment in accordance with both.</td></tr><tr><td>12. His eyes were like a flame of fire,</td><td>The Divine wisdom of the Lord's Divine love.</td></tr><tr><td>and on His head were many jewels. <sup>1</sup></td><td>The Divine truths in the Word from Him.</td></tr><tr><td>He had a name written that no one knew but Himself.</td><td>What the Word is like in its spiritual and celestial senses, no one sees but the Lord, and the person to whom He reveals it.</td></tr><tr><td>13. He was clothed with a garment stained with blood, and His name is called "The Word of God."</td><td>Divine truth in its outmost sense, or the Word in its letter, to which violence has been done.</td></tr><tr><td>14. And the hosts in heaven followed Him on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</td><td>Angels in the New Christian Heaven, who, being conjoined with the Lord, have a deeper understanding of the Word and so possess truths that are pure and genuine.</td></tr><tr><td>15. Out of His mouth went forth a sharp sword,</td><td>The dispersion of falsities by the Lord by means of doctrine from the Word.</td></tr><tr><td>that with it He might strike the nations, and He will shepherd them with a rod of iron.</td><td>He will convince all who are caught up in a dead faith by means of truths in the literal sense of the Word and by rational considerations.</td></tr><tr><td>He treads the winepress of the fury and wrath of Almighty God.</td><td>The Lord alone has endured all the church's evils and all the violence done to the Word, thus to Him.</td></tr><tr><td>16. And He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written: "King of kings and Lord of lords."</td><td>The Lord teaches in the Word who He is, that He is the Divine truth of Divine wisdom and the Divine goodness of Divine love, thus that He is God of the universe.</td></tr><tr><td>17. Then I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, "Come and gather together for the supper of the great God,</td><td>The Lord, out of Divine love and so out of Divine zeal, calling all people who have a spiritual affection for truth and think about heaven, and summoning them to the New Church and to conjunction with Himself, thus to eternal life.</td></tr><tr><td>18. that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, both small and great."</td><td>An assimilation of goods from the Lord through the truths in the Word and in doctrine drawn from it, of every level of meaning, degree or kind.</td></tr><tr><td>19. And I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army.</td><td>All inwardly evil people who professed faith alone will, together with their leaders and followers, attack the Lord's Divine truths in His Word and assail those who will belong to the Lord's New Church.</td></tr><tr><td>20. Then the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who worked signs in its presence, by which he led astray those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image.</td><td>All those who professed faith alone and were inwardly evil, both the laity and common people and the clergy and the learned, who by arguments and assertions that faith alone is the only means of salvation, had brought others to accept that faith and to live in accordance with it,</td></tr><tr><td>These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone.</td><td>were all of them cast as they were into the hell where their loves of falsity and accompanying lusts for evil are found.</td></tr><tr><td>21. And the rest were slain with the sword of Him who sat on the horse, which went forth from His mouth.</td><td>All those of various heretical sects among the Protestant Reformed who had not lived according to the Lord's commandments in the Word that they knew, having been judged in accordance with the Word, perished.</td></tr><tr><td>And all the birds were filled with their flesh.</td><td>By their lusts for evil, which they had made their own, they fed, as it were, the demons of hell.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>THE EXPOSITION<p><a href="3927/revelation_19_1.htm">19:1</a> After these things I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, "Alleluia!" This symbolizes a thanksgiving, confession, and celebration of the Lord by angels of the lower heavens because of the Roman Catholics' removal.<p>A great multitude in heaven symbolizes angels of the lower heavens. The voice of the multitude saying, "Alleluia!" symbolizes a thanksgiving, confession and celebration of the Lord by them. "Alleluia" in Hebrew means "Praise God."<p>Thus the voice was the voice of a thanksgiving, confession and celebration of the Lord out of a heartfelt joy, as is apparent from the following passages:<p>Bless Jehovah, O my soul! Alleluia! (<a href="3927/psalms_104_35.htm">Psalms 104:35</a>)<p>Blessed be Jehovah, God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, "Amen! Alleluia!" (<a href="3927/psalms_106_48.htm">Psalms 106:48</a>)<p>We will bless Jah from this time forth and forevermore. Alleluia! (<a href="3927/psalms_115_18.htm">Psalms 115:18</a>)<p>Let every soul praise Jah! Alleluia! (<a href="3927/psalms_150_6.htm">Psalms 150:6</a>)<p>And so on elsewhere, as in <a href="3927/psalms_105_45.htm">Psalms 105:45</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_106_1.htm">106:1</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_111_1.htm">111:1</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_112_1.htm">112:1</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_113_1.htm">113:1</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_113_9.htm">9</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_116_19.htm">116:19</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_117_2.htm">117:2</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_135_3.htm">135:3</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_148_1.htm">148:1</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_148_14.htm">14</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_149_1.htm">149:1</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_149_9.htm">9</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_150_1.htm">150:1</a>.<p>That this occurred because of the Roman Catholics' removal is apparent from the preceding chapter, in which Roman Catholics were the subject. That is why this chapter begins, "After these things." It is apparent also from what follows in verses <a href="3927/revelation_19_2.htm">2</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_19_3.htm">3</a> of this chapter.<p>That the angels meant by the great multitude in heaven are angels of the lower heavens follows from verse <a href="3927/revelation_19_4.htm">4</a> in this chapter, where we are told that the twenty-four elders and four living creatures worshiped Him who sat on the throne, saying, "Amen! Alleluia!" The twenty-four elders and four living creatures mean angels of the higher heavens.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The word translated as "jewels" here means diadems or crowns in the original Greek and Latin, but the writer's definitions of the term elsewhere make plain that he regularly and consistently interpreted it to mean jewels or gems. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 803</h4><p>803. THE NINETEENTH CHAPTER<p>1. After these things I heard as it were the voice of a great crowd in heaven saying, Hallelujah, salvation and glory and honour and power to the Lord our God:<p>2. For true and just are His judgments, for He has judged the great harlot who has corrupted the land with her whoredom, and He has avenged the blood of His servants from (de) her hand.<p>3. And a second time they said, Hallelujah; and her smoke goes up for ages of ages.<p>4. And the twenty-four elders and the four animals fell down, and they adored God sitting upon the throne saying, Amen Hallelujah.<p>5. And a voice came out of the throne saying, Praise our God, O all His servants, and those fearing Him, both the small and the great.<p>6. And I heard as it were the voice of a great crowd, and as it were the voice of many waters, and as it were the voice of powerful thunders, saying, Hallelujah, for the Lord God Almighty reigns.<p>7. Let us rejoice and exult and give glory to Him, for the Lamb's wedding has come, and His wife has made herself ready.<p>8. And it was granted to her that she should be arrayed with fine linen, clean and bright, for the fine linen [signifies] the just deeds of the saints.<p>9. And he said unto me, Write, Blessed are those who are called unto the supper of the Lamb's wedding; and he said, These are the true words of God.<p>10. And I fell down before his feet to adore him, and he said unto me, See thou, do it not (vide, ne), I am thy fellow- servant and of thy brothers having the testimony of Jesus; adore God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.<p>11. And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and the One sitting upon it is called Faithful and True, and in justice He judges and fights.<p>12. And His eyes as it were a flame of fire, and upon His head many diadems, having a Name written that no one knew but Himself.<p>13. And clothed with a blood-stained garment, and His Name is called The Word of God.<p>14. And the armies that are in heaven were following Him upon white horses, clothed with fine linen white and clean.<p>15. And out of His mouth a sharp sword was proceeding, that by means of it He should smite the nations, and He Himself shall lead them to pasture with an iron rod, and He Himself is treading the wine-press of the fury and wrath of Almighty God.<p>16. And upon the garment and upon His thigh He has a Name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.<p>17. And I saw one angel standing in the Sun, and he cried out with a great voice, saying to all the birds flying in the midst of heaven, Come and flock together to the Supper of the Great God;<p>18. That you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of rulers of thousands, and the flesh of strong men, and the flesh of horses, and of those sitting upon them, and the flesh of all, freemen and bondmen, both small and great.<p>19. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the land and their armies gathered together to wage war with the One sitting upon the horse and with His army.<p>20. And the beast was arrested, and with him the false prophet who did signs before him, with which he led astray those accepting the mark of the beast and adoring his image. These two were sent away alive into the lake of fire burning with sulphur.<p>21. And the rest were slain by the sword of the One sitting upon the horse, [the sword] proceeding out of His mouth, and all the birds were satiated with their flesh.<p>THE SPIRITUAL SENSE<p>THE CONTENTS OF THE WHOLE CHAPTER<p>The glorification of the Lord by the angels of heaven because the Roman Catholic form of religion has been put away in the spiritual world, in consequence of which they have come into the light and into their happiness (verses 1-5).<p>The proclamation of the Lord's Coming, and of the New Church from Himself (verses 6-10).<p>The opening of the Word as to its spiritual sense for that Church (verses 11-16).<p>The calling of all men to that [Church] (verses 17-18).<p>The resistance by those who are in faith separated from charity (verse 19).<p>Their removal and damnation (verses 20-21).<p>THE CONTENTS OF EACH OF THE VERSES<p>1. After these things I heard as it were the voice of a great crowd in heaven saying, Hallelujah, signifies a thanksgiving, confession and celebration of the Lord by the angels of the lower heavens on account of the removal of the Babylonians.<p>Salvation and glory and honour and power unto the Lord our God, signifies that now there is salvation from the Lord, because now there is the reception of Divine Truth and Divine Good out of His Divine authority.<p>2. For true and just are His judgments, for He has judged the great harlot who has corrupted the land with her whoredom, signifies because out of justice the profane Babylonian form of religion has been condemned, which has destroyed the Lord's Church by foul adulterations of the Word.<p>And He has avenged the blood of His servants from (de) her hand, signifies retribution on account of the injuries and violent deeds inflicted on the souls of the worshippers of the Lord.<p>3. And a second time they said, Hallelujah, her smoke goes up for ages of ages, signifies thanksgiving and celebration of the Lord for joy that that profane form of religion has been damned for ever.<p>4. And the twenty-four elders and the four animals fell down and adored God sitting upon the throne, saying, Amen Hallelujah, signifies the adoration of the Lord as the God of heaven and earth and as the Judge of the universe by the angels of the higher heavens, and the confirmation of the thanksgiving, confession and celebration of the Lord by the angels of the lower heavens.<p>5. And a voice came out of the throne saying, Praise our God, O all His servants, and those fearing Him, signifies an influx from the Lord into heaven, and thus the unanimity of the angels that all who are in the truths of faith and goods of love should worship the Lord as the Only God of heaven.<p>Both the small and the great, signifies those who out of the truths of faith and goods of love worship the Lord in a lesser or greater degree.<p>6. And I heard as it were the voice of a great crowd, and as it were the voice of many waters, and as it were the voice of powerful thunders, saying, Hallelujah, for the Lord God Almighty reigns, signifies the joy of the angels of the lowest heaven, of the angels of the middle heaven, and of the angels of the highest heaven, that the Only Lord reigns in the Church that is now about to come.<p>7. Let us rejoice and exult and give glory to Him, for the Lamb's wedding has come, signifies joy of soul and heart, and the consequent glorification of the Lord that henceforth there may be effected a full marriage of Himself with the Church.<p>And His wife has made herself ready, signifies that those who will belong to this Church, which is the New Jerusalem, are being assembled, inaugurated and instructed.<p>8. And it was granted to her that she should be arrayed with fine linen clean and bright, signifies that they are being instructed by the Lord in genuine and pure truths by means of the Word.<p>For the fine linen [signifies] the just deeds of the saints signifies that by means of truths out of the Word those who belong to the Lord's Church have the goods of life.<p>9. And he said unto me, Write, Blessed are those who are called unto the supper of the Lamb's wedding, signifies one angel out of heaven sent to John and speaking with him concerning the Lord's New Church, and saying that on earth it would be given to know that those who receive the things that are of that Church have eternal life.<p>And he said, These are the true words of God, signifies that this is to be believed because it is from the Lord.<p>10. And I fell down before his feet to adore him, and he said, See thou, do it not, I am thy fellow-servant and of thy brothers having the testimony of Jesus; adore God, signifies that the angels of heaven are not to be adored and invoked because nothing Divine belongs to them, but that they are associated with men as brothers with brothers with those who worship the Lord, and thus that in company with them the Only Lord is to be adored.<p>For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy, signifies that the acknowledgment that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and at the same time a life in accordance with His precepts, is in the universal sense everything of the Word and of the doctrine thence.<p>11. And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, signifies the spiritual sense of the Word revealed by the Lord, and thereby the disclosure of the interior understanding of the Word, which is the Lord's coming.<p>And the One sitting upon it is called Faithful and True, and in justice He judges and fights, signifies the Lord as to the Word, which is Divine Good and Divine Truth Itself, out of both of which He effects judgment.<p>12. And His eyes as it were a flame of fire, signifies the Lord's Divine Wisdom of Divine Love.<p>And upon His head many diadems, signifies the Divine truths of the Word from Himself.<p>Having a Name written that no one knew but Himself, signifies that no one sees what the Word is like in its spiritual and celestial sense but the Lord and he to whom He Himself reveals it.<p>13. And clothed with a blood-stained garment, and His Name is called The Word of God, signifies Divine Truth in the ultimate sense, or the Word in the letter, on which violence has been inflicted.<p>14. And the armies that are in heaven were following Him upon white horses, clothed with fine linen white and clean, signifies the angels in the Christian New Heaven who were conjoined with the Lord in the interior understanding of the Word, and were thus in pure and genuine truths.<p>15. And out of His mouth a sword was proceeding, signifies the dispersion of untruths by means of the doctrine derived thence from the Lord.<p>That by means of it He should smite the nations, and He Himself shall lead them to pasture with an iron rod, signifies that by means of the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word and by rational things He will convince all who are in a dead faith.<p>And He Himself is treading the wine-press of the fury and wrath of Almighty God, signifies that the Lord Only has endured all the evils of the Church, and all the violence inflicted on the Word, thus on Himself.<p>16. And upon the garment and upon His thigh He has a Name written, King of kings and Lord of lords, signifies that the Lord teaches in the Word what He is like, that He is the Divine Truth of Divine Wisdom and the Divine Good of Divine Love, thus that He is the God of the universe.<p>17. And I saw one angel standing in the Sun, and he cried out with a great voice, saying to all the birds flying in the midst of heaven, Come and flock together for the Supper of the Great God, signifies the Lord out of Divine Love, and consequently out of Divine Zeal, calling and assembling all who are in the affection of spiritual truth and who think about heaven to the New Church and to conjunction with Himself, thus to eternal life.<p>18. That you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of rulers of thousands and the flesh of strong men, and the flesh of horses, and of those sitting upon them, and the flesh of [all] freemen and bondmen, both small and great, signifies the appropriation of goods from the Lord by means of the truths of the Word and the doctrine thence derived, in every sense, degree and kind.<p>19. And I saw the beast and the kings of the land and their armies gathered together to wage war with the One sitting upon the horse and with His army, signifies that all the interiorly evil who have made profession of faith alone, with the leaders and their adherents, are going to attack the Lord's Divine Truths in His Word and to infest those who will be of the Lord's New Church.<p>20. And the beast was arrested, and with him the false prophet who did signs before him with which he led astray those accepting the mark of the beast and those adoring his image, signifies all those who made profession of faith alone and were interiorly evil, the laity and common people as well as the clergy and the learned, who by means of reasonings and entreaties [to the effect] that faith alone is the sole means of salvation led others to receiving that faith and living in accordance therewith.<p>These two were sent away alive into the lake of fire burning with sulphur, signifies that all those, just as they were, were cast into the hell where there are the loves of untruth and at the same time the lusts of evil.<p>21. And the rest were slain by the sword of the One sitting upon the horse, proceeding out of His mouth, signifies that all [who are] of the various heresies among the Reformed who have not lived in accordance with the Lord's precepts in the Word that they were aware of, being judged out of the Word, perish.<p>And all the birds were satiated with their flesh, signifies that the infernal genii are nourished as it were upon the lusts of their evil, which are their own (propria).<p>THE EXPOSITION<p>[verse 1] 'After these things I heard as it were the voice of a great crowd in heaven saying, Hallelujah' signifies a thanksgiving, confession and celebration of the Lord by the angels of the lower heavens on account of the removal of the Babylonians. By 'a great crowd in heaven' are signified the angels of the lower heavens. By its voice saying Hallelujah' is signified a thanksgiving, confession and celebration of the Lord by them. By 'Hallelujah' in the Hebrew language is signified 'Praise God.' Thus it was a voice of thanksgiving, confession and celebration of the Lord from joy of heart, as is plain from these quotations:<p>Bless Jehovah, O my soul, Hallelujah. <a href="3927/psalms_104_35.htm">Psalms 104:35</a>.<p>Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting, and let all the people say, Amen Hallelujah. <a href="3927/psalms_106_48.htm">Psalms 106:48</a>.<p>We will bless Jah from now and even for evermore, Hallelujah. <a href="3927/psalms_115_18.htm">Psalms 115:18</a>.<p>Let every soul praise Jah, Hallelujah. <a href="3927/psalms_150_6.htm">Psalms 150:6</a>; besides elsewhere, as <a href="3927/psalms_105_45.htm">Psalms 105:45</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_106_1.htm">106:1</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_111_1.htm">111:1</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_112_1.htm">112:1</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_113_1.htm">113:1</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_113_9.htm">9</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_116_19.htm">116:19</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_117_2.htm">117:2</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_135_3.htm">135:3</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_148_1.htm">148:1</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_148_14.htm">14</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_149_1.htm">149:1</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_149_9.htm">9</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_150_1.htm">150:1</a>. That it is on account of the rejection of the Babylonians is plain from the preceding chapter in which the Babylonians are treated of. Therefore it is said, 'After these things.' It is also plain from the things following in verses 2-3 in this chapter. That those who are understood by 'a great crowd in heaven' are the angels of the lower heavens is established from verse 4 of this chapter, where it is said that 'the twenty-four elders and the four animals adored the One sitting upon the throne, saying, Amen Hallelujah,' by whom are understood the angels of the higher heavens. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 803</h4><p>803. Revelation 19<p>1. After these things I heard as it were a voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Alleluia, salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God;<p>2. For true and just are His judgments; for He hath judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth with her whoredom, and He hath avenged the blood of His servants at her hand.<p>3. And a second time they said, Alleluia; and her smoke shall go up unto the ages of the ages.<p>4. And the twenty-four elders and the four animals fell down, and adored God who sitteth upon the throne, saying, Amen. Alleluia.<p>5. And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye His servants, and ye that fear Him, both the small and the great.<p>6. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as it were the voice of many waters, and as it were the voice of mighty thunders, saying, Alleluia, for the Lord God the Almighty reigneth.<p>7. Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife hath made herself ready.<p>8. And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen clean and bright; for the fine linen is the just deeds of the saints.<p>9. And He said unto me, Write, Happy are they that have been called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And He said, These are the true words of God.<p>10. And I fell down before his feet to adore him; and he said unto me, See thou do it not; I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus; adore God; for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.<p>11. And I saw heaven opened; and behold a white horse; and He that sitteth upon him is called faithful and true; and in justice He doth judge and make war.<p>12. And His eyes were as a flame of fire, and upon His head were many diadems; having a name written, which no one knew but Himself:<p>13. And He was clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and His name is called, The Word of God.<p>14. And the armies which are in heaven followed Him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen white and clean.<p>15. And out of His mouth went forth a sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations; and He shall tend them with a rod of iron: and He treadeth the wine-press of the wine of the fury and anger of God Almighty.<p>16. And He hath upon His garment and upon His thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.<p>17. And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a great voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, Come, and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;<p>18. That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders of thousands, and the flesh of the mighty, and the flesh of horses, and of them to sit upon them, and the flesh of all, free and bond, both small and great.<p>19. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with Him that sat upon the horse, and with His army.<p>20. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet, that did signs before him, with which he seduced them that received the mark of the beast, and that adored his image; these two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone.<p>21. And the rest were slain by the sword of Him that sat upon the horse, that proceeded out of His mouth; and all the birds were satiated with their flesh.<p>THE SPIRITUAL SENSE<p>The contents of the whole chapter<p>The glorification of the Lord by the angels of heaven, because the Roman Catholic religious persuasion is removed in the spiritual world, whereby they have come into the light and into their happiness (verses <a href="3927/revelation_19_1.htm">1-5</a>). Annunciation concerning the Lord's coming, and concerning the New Church from Him (verses <a href="3927/revelation_18_6.htm">6-10</a>). The opening of the Word as to the spiritual sense for that church (verses <a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">11-16</a>). The calling of all to it (verses <a href="3927/revelation_19_17.htm">17-18</a>). Resistance by those who are in faith separated from charity (verse <a href="3927/revelation_19_19.htm">19</a>).

"And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye His servants, and ye that fear Him," signifies influx from the Lord into heaven, and thus unanimity of the angels, that all who are in the truths of faith and in the goods of love should worship the Lord as the only God of heaven, (<a href="809.htm">809</a>).

"For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy," signifies that the acknowledgment that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and at the same time a life according to His precepts, in the universal sense the all of the Word and of doctrine therefrom, (<a href="819.htm">819</a>).<p>Verse 11.

"These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone," signifies that all those, as they were, were cast into hell, where are loves of falsity and at the same time lusts of evil, (<a href="835.htm">835</a>).<p>Verse 21. "And the rest were slain by the sword of Him that sat upon the horse, that proceeded out of His mouth," signifies that all from the various heresies among the Reformed, who have not lived according to the Lord's commandments in the Word, which they knew, being judged from the Word, perish, (<a href="836.htm">836</a>).

After these things I heard as it were a voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Alleluia, signifies thanksgiving, confession, and celebration of the Lord by the angels of the lower heavens, on account of the removal of the Babylonians. By "a great multitude in heaven," are signified the angels of the lower heavens; by "their voice saying, Alleluia," is signified thanksgiving, confession, and celebration of the Lord by them; by "Alleluia," in the Hebrew language, is signified, Praise ye God, therefore it was an expression of thanksgiving, confession, and celebration of the Lord from joy of heart, as appears from these passages:<p>Bless Jehovah, O my soul. Alleluia, (<a href="3927/psalms_104_35.htm">Psalms 104:35</a>).<p>Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting; and let all the people say, Amen. Alleluia, (<a href="3927/psalms_106_48.htm">Psalms 106:48</a>).<p>We will bless Jah from now even to eternity. Alleluia, (<a href="3927/psalms_115_18.htm">Psalms 115:18</a>).<p>Let every soul praise Jah. Alleluia, (<a href="3927/psalms_150_6.htm">Psalms 150:6</a>; besides other places, as <a href="3927/psalms_105_45.htm">Psalms 105:45</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_106_1.htm">106:1</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_111_1.htm">111:1</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_112_1.htm">112:1</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_113_1.htm">113:1</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_113_9.htm">9</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_116_19.htm">116:19</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_117_2.htm">117:2</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_135_3.htm">135:3</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_148_1.htm">148:1</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_148_14.htm">14</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_149_1.htm">149:1</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_149_9.htm">9</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_150_1.htm">150:1</a>).<p>That it is on account of the rejection of the Babylonians, is evident from the preceding chapter, which treats of the Babylonians, for which reason it is said, "After these things," and also from what follows (verses <a href="3927/revelation_18_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_18_3.htm">3</a>2 in this chapter. That the angels of the lower heavens are meant by "a great multitude in heaven," is plain from verse 4 (<a href="3927/revelation_19_4.htm">Revelation 19:4</a>) of this chapter, where it is said that "the twenty-four elders and the four animals adored Him that sat upon the throne, saying Amen. Alleluia," by whom the angels of the higher heavens are meant. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 803 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>803. CAPUT XIX <p>1. POST haec audivi tanquam vocem turbae multae in Caelo, dicentis Alleluja, Salus et Gloria et Honor et Potentia Domino Deo nostro: <p>2. Quia vera et justa judicia Ipsius; quia judicavit Meretricem magnam, quae corrupit terram scortatione sua, et Vindicavit sanguinem servorum Suorum de manu ejus. <p>3. Et secundo dixerunt, Alleluja; et fumus ejus ascendit <sup>1</sup>in saecula saeculorum. <p>4. Et prociderunt Seniores viginti quatuor, et quatuor Animalia, et adoraverunt Deum sedentem super Throno, dicentes, Amen, Alleluja. <p>5. Et vox e Throno exivit, dicens, Laudate Deum nostrum, Omnes servi Ipsius, et timentes Ipsum, et parvi et magni. <p>6. Et audivi tanquam vocem turbae multae, et tanquam vocem aquarum multarum, et tanquam vocem tonitruum vehementium, dicentium, Alleluja, quia regnat Dominus Deus Omnipotens. <p>7. Gaudeamus et exultemus et demus gloriam Ipsi, quia venerunt nuptiae Agni, et Uxor Ipsius paravit se. <p>8. Et datum illi ut amiceretur byssino mundo et splendido, nam byssinum justitiae sanctorum. <p>9. Et dixit mihi, Scribe, Beati qui ad Caenam nuptiarum Agni vocati sunt; et dixit, Haec verba vera sunt Dei. <p>10. Et procidi ante pedes ejus adorare illum; et dixit mihi, Vide, ne, conservus tuus sum, et fratrum tuorum habentium testimonium Jesu; Deum adora; nam testimonium Jesu est spiritus prophetiae. <p>11. Et vidi Caelum apertum, et ecce Equus albus, et Sedens super illo vocatur Fidelis et Verus, et in justitia judicat et pugnat. <p>12. Et Oculi Ipsius tanquam flamma ignis, et super capite Ipsius diademata multa; habens Nomen scriptum, quod nemo novit nisi Ipse. <p>13. Et circumindutus vestimento tincto sanguine, et vocatur Nomen Ipsius Verbum Dei. <p>14. Et exercitus qui in Caelo sequebantur Ipsum super equis albis, induti byssino albo et mundo. <p>15. Et ex Ore Ipsius prodibat romphaea acuta, ut per illam percutiat gentes; et Ipse pascet illas virga ferrea; et Ipse calcat torcular vini furoris et irae Dei Omnipotentis. <p>16. Et habet super vestimento et super femore Suo Nomen scriptum, Rex regum et Dominus dominorum. <p>17. Et vidi unum Angelum stantem in Sole; et clamavit voce magna dicens Omnibus avibus volantibus in medio Caelo, Venite et congregamini ad Caenam magni Dei. <p>18. Ut comedatis carnes regum, et carnes chiliarchorum, et carnes fortium, et carnes equorum et sedentium super illis, et carnes omnium liberorum et servorum, et parvorum et magnorum. <p>19.
