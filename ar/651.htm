<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第651节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>651.“丢在神烈怒的大酒榨中”表对他们行为的性质的审查，即它们是邪恶。将葡萄园的串串（葡萄）“丢在酒榨中”表示审查他们的行为，因为“串串（葡萄）”表示这些行为（参看<a href="649.htm">649</a>节）。但这酒榨因被称为“神烈怒的大酒榨”，故表示审查他们的行为是邪恶；因为“神的烈怒”论及邪恶（<a href="635.htm">635</a>节）。“酒榨”之所以表示审查，是因为在酒榨中，葡萄汁从葡萄、橄榄油从橄榄被压榨出来，从所榨出的葡萄汁和橄榄油就能判断出葡萄和橄榄的品质。由于“葡萄园”表示基督教会，“串串（葡萄）”表示行为，所以把葡萄“丢在酒榨中”表示审查基督教会之人当中的这些行为。但由于他们已将信与仁分离，并认为信就得救，无需律法行为，还由于从与仁分离之信所出的，无非是恶行，故这酒榨被称为“神烈怒的大酒榨”。在以下经文中，“酒榨”或“压酒池”也表示对行为的审查：</p><p>我所亲爱的有葡萄园在油之子的角上；他栽种上等的葡萄树，又凿出压酒池，指望结好葡萄，反倒结了野葡萄。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 5.1.htm"> 5:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 5.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>开镰吧，因为庄稼熟了；践踏吧，因为酒榨满了，酒池盈溢，他们的罪恶甚大。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.13.htm">3:13</a>）</p><p>谷场和酒榨都不能喂养以色列人，新酒也必使她失望。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何 9.2.htm"> 9:2</a>） </p><p>那行毁灭的已经临到你所摘的葡萄，我使酒从酒榨绝流，无人踹酒欢呼，那欢呼却不是欢呼。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.32.htm">48:32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.33.htm">33</a>）</p><p>有个家主栽了一个葡萄园，在里面挖了一个压酒池，租给园户，但他们却杀了差给他们的众仆人，最后还杀了他的儿子。（马太福音21: 33-39）</p><p>在约珥书，“酒榨”也论及仁之良善，信之真理由这良善发出：</p><p>锡安的女儿哪，你们要快乐，禾场必满了麦子，榨池必有新酒和油盈溢。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.23.htm">2:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.24.htm">24</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 651</h4><p>651. And threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. This symbolizes an examination of the character of the people's works, revealing that their works were evil.<p>To throw clusters of grapes into a winepress means, symbolically, to examine people's works, for clusters of grapes symbolize works (see no. <a href="649.htm">649</a> above). But because the winepress is called the great winepress of the wrath of God, it symbolizes a finding that their works were evil; for the wrath of God is predicated of evil (no. <a href="635.htm">635</a>).<p>A winepress symbolizes examination because in presses the juice is expressed from grapes, and oil from olives, and one perceives the character of the grapes and olives from the juice and oil expressed. Moreover, because the vineyard symbolizes the Christian Church, and its clusters of grapes the people's works, therefore throwing the clusters into a winepress symbolizes an examination among people in the Christian Church. But because they have divorced faith from charity and made faith saving without the works of the law, and because a faith divorced from charity produces only evil works, the winepress is therefore called the great winepress of the wrath of God.<p>An examination of people's works is symbolized also by a winepress in the following passages:<p>My beloved had a vineyard on a fruitful hill. He... planted it with a choice vine. He also... hewed out a winepress in it; and he expected it to produce good grapes, but it produced wild grapes. (<a href="3927/isaiah_5_1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-2</a>)<p>Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. ...go down, for the winepress is full, the vats have overflowed; for their wickedness is great. (<a href="3927/joel_3_13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>)<p>The threshing floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall deceive them. (<a href="3927/hosea_9_1.htm">Hosea 9:1-2</a>)<p>The plunderer has fallen on... your grape harvest... I have caused wine to fail from the winepress; no one will tread with joyous shouting. There is no joyous shouting! (<a href="3927/jeremiah_48_32.htm">Jeremiah 48:32-33</a>)<p>...a householder... planted a vineyard..., and dug in it a wine-press..., and leased it to farmers... (<a href="3927/matthew_21_33.htm">Matthew 21:33</a>)<p>But they killed the servants he sent to them, and finally killed his son. <sup>1</sup><p>A winepress mentioned in Joel refers to goods of charity from which spring truths of faith:<p>Rejoice, you children of Zion... The threshing floors are full of grain, and the presses overflow with new wine and oil. (<a href="3927/joel_2_23.htm">Joel 2:23-24</a>)<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="3927/matthew_21_34.htm">Matthew 21:34-39</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 651</h4><p>651. 'And cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God' signifies an examination of the quality of their works, that they were evil. By 'to cast the clusters of the vineyard into the winepress' is signified to examine works, for these are signified by 'clusters,' as may be seen above (<a href="649.htm">649</a>). But because it is termed 'the great winepress of the wrath of God' an examination is signified [disclosing] that the works were evil, for 'the wrath of God' is said concerning evil (<a href="635.htm">635</a>). The examination is signified by 'the winepress' because in wine-presses must is pressed out of the clusters, and oil out of olives, and from the pressed out must and oil it is perceived what the clusters and olives were like. And because by 'the vineyard' is signified the Christian Church and by its 'clusters' are signified works, therefore the examination of the latter with the men of the Christian Church is signified by 'to cast into the winepress.' But because they have separated faith from charity and have made it saving without the works of the law, and because none but evil works proceed out of a faith separated from charity, therefore it is termed 'the great winepress of the wrath of God.' The examination of works is also signified by 'winepress' in the following passages:<p>My well-beloved had a vineyard in the horn of a son of oil; he planted it with a noble vine; he also hewed out a winepress in it, and he expected it to produce grapes but it produced wild grapes. <a href="3927/isaiah_5_1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-2</a>.<p>Put forth the sickle because the harvest has ripened, get you down because the winepress is full, the vats have overflowed, for their wickedness is great. <a href="3927/joel_3_13.htm">Joel 3:13</a> [H.B 4:13].<p>The threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the must shall deceive her, <a href="3927/hosea_9_1.htm">Hosea 9:1-2</a>.<p>The waster has fallen upon thy vintage, I have made the wine out of the winepress to cease, none shall tread hedad, <sup>1</sup>hedad there is no hedad. <a href="3927/jeremiah_48_32.htm">Jeremiah 48:32-33</a>.<p>A householder planted a vineyard, and digged a winepress in it, and let it out to farmers, but they killed the servants sent to them, and at last the Son. <a href="3927/matthew_21_33.htm">Matthew 21:33</a>.<p>'Winepress' is also said of the goods of charity out of which the truths of faith [are derived], in Joel:<p>Rejoice, O sons of Zion, the threshing-floors are full of corn, and the winepresses are overflowing with must and oil. <a href="3927/joel_2_23.htm">2:23-24</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 651</h4><p>651. And he cast it into the great winepress of the anger of God, signifies exploration of the quality of their works, that they were evil. By "casting the clusters of the vineyard into the winepress," is signified to explore their works, for these are signified by "clusters," as may be seen above, (<a href="649.htm">649</a>). But as it is called "the great winepress of the anger of God," it signifies exploration of their works as being evil, for the "anger of God" is said of evil, (<a href="635.htm">635</a>). "A winepress" signifies exploration, because, in presses, must is pressed out from clusters, and oil from olives, and from the must and oil which are pressed out is perceived the quality of the grapes and olives. And as by "a vineyard" is signified the Christian church, and by its "clusters" are signified works, therefore the exploring of these with the men of the Christian church is signified by "casting them into the winepress." But because they have separated faith from charity, and have made faith without the works of the law saving; and since from faith separated from charity none but evil works proceed, therefore it is called "the great winepress of the anger of God." The exploration of works is also signified by a winepress in the following passages:<p>My beloved hath a vineyard in the horn of a son of oil; he planted it with a noble vine, he also hewed out a winepress therein, and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, but it brought forth wild grapes, (<a href="3927/isaiah_5_1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-2</a>).<p>Send ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe; come, get you down; for the winepress is full, the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great, (<a href="3927/joel_3_13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>).<p>The threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the must shall fail in her, (<a href="3927/hosea_9_2.htm">Hosea 9:2</a>).<p>The waster is fallen upon thy vintage, I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses, none shall tread with shouting, the shouting shall be no shouting, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_48_32.htm">Jeremiah 48:32-33</a>).<p>A householder planted a vineyard, and digged a winepress in it, and let it out to husbandmen, but they slew the servants sent unto them, and last of all the son, (<a href="3927/matthew_21_33.htm">Matthew 21:33-39</a>).<p>A winepress is also spoken of the goods of charity, from which truths of faith proceed, in Joel:<p>Rejoice O daughters of Zion, and the threshing-floors are full of grain, and the winepresses shall overflow with must and oil, (<a href="3927/joel_2_23.htm">Joel 2:23-24</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 651 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>651. "Et conjecit in torcular irae Dei magnum," significat explorationem qualia erant opera eorum, quod essent mala.--Per "conjicere in torcular botros vineae" significatur explorare opera, haec enim per "botros" significantur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_651/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_649" target=_top>649</a>); sed quia dicitur "torcular irae Dei magnum," significatur exploratio quod opera essent mala, nam "ira Dei" dicitur de malo (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_651/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_635" target=_top>635</a>). <sup>1</sup>Quod per "torcular" significetur exploratio, est quia in torcularibus exprimitur mustum ex botris, et oleum ex olivis, et ex musto et oleo expressis percipitur quales botri et olivae fuerunt; et quia per "vineam" significatur Ecclesia Christiana, et per "botros" ejus significantur opera, ideo horum exploratio apud homines Ecclesiae Christianae per "conjicere in torcular" significatur; sed quia separaverunt Fidem a Charitate, et illam absque Operibus Legis salvificam fecerunt, et ex Fide separata a Charitate non procedunt nisi mala opera, ideo dicitur "torcular irae Dei magnum." Exploratio operum etiam significatur per "torcular" in sequentibus locis: <p>"Vinea fuit Dilecto meo in cornu filii olei; plantavit eam vite nobili, etiam Torcular excidit in ea, et exspectavit ut faceret uvas sed fecit labruscas," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_651/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_5_1-2" target=_top>Esaias 5:1-2</a>);<p>"Emittite falcem quia maturuit messis, descendite quia plenum est Torcular, exundarunt Lacus, quia magna malitia eorum," (Joel 4:13 (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_651/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joel_3_13" target=_top>3:13</a>));<p>"Area et Torcular non pascent eos, et mustum mentietur illi," <sup>2</sup>(<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_651/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_hosea_9_2" target=_top>Hoschea 9:2</a>); <sup>3</sup><p>"Super vindemiam tuam vastator cecidit, vinum ex Torculari cessare feci, non calcabit hedad, hedad non hedad," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_651/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_48_32-33" target=_top>Jeremias 48:32-33</a>; <sup>4</sup><p>Paterfamilias plantavit Vineam, et fodit in ea Torcular, et locavit agricolis, sed occiderunt servos ad illos missos, et denique Filium, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_651/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_21_33-39" target=_top>Matthaeus 21:33-39</a>). <sup>5</sup><p>Dicitur etiam "torcular" de bonis charitatis, ex quibus vera fidei, apud Joelem: <p>"Filii <sup>6</sup>Sionis gaudete; plenae sunt areae frumento, et exundant Torcularia mustum et oleum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_651/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joel_2_23-24" target=_top>2:23-24</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;635 pro "634"<p>2.&nbsp;illi pro "illis"<p>3.&nbsp;2 pro "1, 2"<p>4.&nbsp;32, 33 pro "33, 34"<p>5.&nbsp;33-39 pro "33"<p>6.&nbsp;Filii pro "Filiae" </p>
