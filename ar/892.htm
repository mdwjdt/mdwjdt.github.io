<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第892节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>892.“杀人的、淫乱的、行邪术的、拜偶像的和一切说谎话的”表所有无视十诫，没有避开其中所提到如罪的任何邪恶，因而活在它们当中的人。至于十诫中“不可杀人”、“不可奸淫”、“不可偷盗”和“不可作假见证”这四诫的三重含义，即属世、属灵和属天意义，可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之生活篇》（<a href="../life/62.htm">62</a>-<a href="../life/91.htm">91</a>节）；故没有必要在此解释它们；不过，此处提到“行邪术的和拜偶像的”，以代替第七诫，即“不可偷盗”；“行邪术的”表示那些探求真理，却歪曲它们以确认虚假和邪恶的人，如那些接受“没有人能凭自己行善”这一真理，却利用它来确认唯信之人所做的那样；事实上，这是一种属灵的偷窃。至于“邪术”进一步表示什么，可参看前文（<a href="462.htm">462</a>节）。“拜偶像的”表示那些不是出于圣言，因而不是出于主，而是出于自己的聪明设立敬拜，或处于敬拜的人（<a href="459.htm">459</a>节）；那些仅凭错解的保罗的一句话，而不是凭主的任何话，就编造了教会的普遍教义之人也是如此，这同样是一种属灵的偷窃；“说谎话的”表示那些陷入源于邪恶的虚假之人（<a href="924.htm">924</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 892</h4><p>892. "And murderers, the sexually licentious, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars." This symbolizes all those people who have no regard for the Ten Commandments, and do not refrain from any of the evils named there as sins, and therefore live caught up in them.<p>What is symbolically meant on three levels, natural, spiritual and celestial, by these four of the Ten Commandments - namely, you shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, and you shall not bear false witness - may be seen in The Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem, <a href="../life/62.htm">62-91</a>. Consequently there is no need to expound them here again. <p>However, in place of the seventh commandment not to steal, listed here are sorcerers and idolaters, and sorcerers symbolize people who seek truths, which they falsify in order to use them to defend falsities and evils, as those do who take this truth, that no one can do good of himself, and use it to defend faith alone. For this is a type of spiritual theft. Moreover, what enchantments are may be seen in no. <a href="462.htm">462</a> above. Idolaters symbolize people who institute worship, or take part in worship, not from the Word, thus not from the Lord, but from their own intelligence (no. <a href="459.htm">459</a>), as those do also who, on the basis of a single statement of Paul's, <sup>1</sup>wrongly interpreted, and not on the basis of any of the Lord's words, have fabricated the whole doctrine of the church; and this, too, is a type of spiritual theft. Liars symbolize people caught up in falsities arising from evil (no. <a href="924.htm">924</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law." (<a href="3927/romans_3_28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 892</h4><p>892. 'And murderers and whoremongers and enchanters and idolaters and [all] liars' signifies all those who make the precepts of the Decalogue of no account and do not flee from any of the evils there mentioned as sins, and therefore live in them. What is signified by the four precepts of the Decalogue that are 'Thou shalt not kill,' 'thou shalt not commit adultery,' 'thou shalt not steal,' and 'thou shalt not bear false witness,' in a threefold sense, natural, spiritual and celestial, may be seen in <a href="../life/62.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF LIFE FOR THE NEW JERUSALEM 62-91</a>. There is therefore no need to expound them again here. But instead of the seventh precept, which is 'thou shalt not steal,' there are mentioned here 'enchanters and idolaters'; and by 'enchanters' are signified those who search for truths, which they falsify so as to confirm untruths and evils, just as those do who take up this truth, that no one can do good from himself, and by means of it confirm faith alone, for this is a kind of spiritual theft. What 'enchantment' is besides may be seen above (<a href="462.htm">462</a>). By 'idolaters' are signified those who establish worship or are in worship derived not from the Word, thus not from the Lord, but from self-intelligence (<a href="459.htm">459</a>), as also those have done who out of a single saying of Paul falsely understood, and not out of any Word of the Lord, have fabricated the Church's universal doctrine. This also is a kind of spiritual theft. By 'liars' are signified those who are in untruths derived from evil (<a href="924.htm">924</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 892</h4><p>892. And murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, signifies all those who make no account of the commandments of the Decalogue, and do not shun any evils therein mentioned as sins, and therefore live in them. What is signified by these four commandments of the Decalogue, "Thou shalt not kill," "thou shalt not commit adultery," "thou shalt not steal," and "thou shalt not testify falsely," in their threefold sense, natural, spiritual, and celestial, may be seen in The Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem, (<a href="62.htm">62-91</a>); therefore it is unnecessary to explain them here; but instead of the seventh commandment, which is, "Thou shalt not steal," are here mentioned "sorcerers and idolaters;" and by "sorcerers" are signified they who inquire after truths, which they falsify in order to confirm falsities and evils, as they do who take up this truth, that no one can do good from himself, and by it confirm faith alone, for this is a species of spiritual theft. What "sorcery" further signifies may be seen above, (<a href="462.htm">462</a>). By "idolaters" are signified they who establish worship, or are in worship, not from the Word, thus not from the Lord, but from their own intelligence, (<a href="459.htm">459</a>); as also they have done who, from a single saying of Paul, falsely understood, and not from any word of the Lord, have fabricated the universal doctrine of the church, which likewise is a species of spiritual theft; by "liars" are signified they who are in falsities from evil, (<a href="924.htm">924</a>[1-2]). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 892 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>892. "Et homicidis, et scortatoribus, et incantatoribus, et idololatris, et (omnibus) mendacibus," significat omnes illos qui nihili faciunt praecepta Decalogi, et non fugiunt aliqua mala ibi nominata ut peccata, et ideo vivunt in illis. -Quid per quatuor praecepta Decalogi, quae sunt "Non occides," "Non adulteraberis," "Non furaberis," et "Non false testaberis," in triplici Sensu, naturali, spirituali, et caelesti, significatur, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_892/swedenborg_doctrina-vitae-pro-novae-hierosolyma_62" target=_top>Doctrina Vitae pro Nova Hierosolyma 62-91</a>; quare non opus est illa hic iterum explicare. Sed pro septimo praecepto, quod est "Non furaberis," nominantur hic "incantatores et idololatrae;" et per "incantatores" significantur qui inquirunt vera, quae falsificant, ut per illa confirment falsa et mala, sicut faciunt illi qui assumunt hoc verum, Quod nemo possit facere bonum a se, et per id confirmant solam Fidem; hoc enim est species furti spiritualis: quid porro incantatio, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_892/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_462" target=_top>462</a>); per "idololatras" significantur qui non ex Verbo, ita non ex Domino, sed ex propria intelligentia instituunt cultum, aut in cultu sunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_892/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_459" target=_top>459</a>); ut quoque fecerunt, qui ex unico dicto Pauli false intellecto, et non ex ullo Verbo Domini, doctrinam universalem Ecclesiae fabricaverunt, quod etiam est species furti spiritualis: per "mendaces" significantur qui in falsis sunt ex malo (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_892/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924" target=_top>924</a>). </p>
