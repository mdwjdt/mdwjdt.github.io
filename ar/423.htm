<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>423.“日头和天空，都因这坑的烟昏暗了”表真理之光由此变得幽暗。</p><p>此处“日头”和“天空”表示真理之光，因为“日头”表示爱，由此而来的“光”表示神性真理；所以，当经上说“日头昏暗”，同时“天空”也昏暗时，它表示神性真理变得幽暗；这是由于“都因这坑的烟”所表示的欲望的虚假。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 423</h4><p>423. And the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit. This symbolically means that therefore the light of truth became thick darkness.<p>The sun and the air here symbolize the light of truth, for the sun symbolizes love, and the light from it, Divine truth. Consequently, when we are told that the sun was darkened, and with it the air, it symbolically means that Divine truth became thick darkness. That this resulted from falsities accompanying lusts is symbolically meant by its being because of the smoke of the pit. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 423</h4><p>423. 'And the sun was darkened and the air by reason of the smoke of the pit' signifies that as a consequence the light of truth became thick-darkness. By 'sun' and 'air' here is signified the light of truth, for by the sun is signified love and by the light therefrom Divine Truth; and therefore when it is said that 'the sun was darkened' and at the same time 'the air,' it is signified that Divine Truth became thick-darkness. That this results from the untruths of lusts is signified by its being 'by reason of the smoke of the pit. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 423</h4><p>423. And the sun and the air were darkened from the smoke of the pit, signifies that thereby the light of truth became thick darkness. By "the sun" and "the air" is here signified the light of truth, for by "the sun" is signified love, and by "the light" thence the Divine truth; wherefore when it is said that "the sun is darkened," and at the same time "the air," it signifies that the Divine truth had become thick darkness; that this was from the falsities of lusts is signified by its being from "the smoke of the pit." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 423 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>423. "Et obscuratus est sol et aer e fumo putei," significat quod inde lux veri facta sit caligo. - Per "solem" et "aerem" significatur hic lux veri, per "solem" enim significatur amor, et per "lucem" inde Divinum verum; quare cum dicitur quod "sol obscuratus sit," et simul "aer," significatur quod Divinum verum factum sit caligo; quod id ex falsis concupiscentiarum, significatur per quod ex "fumo putei." </p>
