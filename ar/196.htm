<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第196节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>196.“我的新名”表唯独敬拜主，以及前教会所没有的新事物。“主的名”表借以敬拜主的全部（参看<a href="81.htm">81</a>节），故此处“主的新名”表唯独敬拜主，以及前教会所没有的新事物。在新教会，唯独主受敬拜。这一点从启示录（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.9.htm">21:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.10.htm">10</a>）明显可知，在那里，该教会被称为“羔羊的妻”。这个教会有新的事物，这从启示录（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.5.htm">21:5</a>）明显可知。在那里，经上说：“看哪，我将一切都更新了”。因此，这就是“要写在他上面的我的新名”的含义。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 196</h4><p>196. "'Also My new name.'" This symbolizes worship of the Lord alone, with new elements that did not exist in the prior church.<p>To be shown that the Lord's name symbolizes everything by which He is worshiped, see no. <a href="81.htm">81</a> above. Thus it means here worship of the Lord alone, with new elements that did not exist in the prior church.<p>That worship in the New Church will be worship of the Lord alone is apparent from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21</a>, verses <a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">9</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_21_10.htm">10</a>, where this church is called the Lamb's wife.<p>That this church will have new elements in it is apparent from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_21_5.htm">21:5</a>, where we are told, "Behold, I make all things new."<p>This is therefore the symbolic meaning of "My new name" which will be engraved on them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 196</h4><p>196. 'And My new Name' signifies the worship of the Only Lord with new things that have not been in the former Church. That by the Lord's 'Name' is signified everything by means of which He is worshipped may be seen above (<a href="81.htm">81</a>). Here therefore [it signifies] the worship of the Only Lord with new things that were not in the former Church. That in the New Church there is worship of the Only Lord is plain from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">21:9-10</a>, where that Church is called THE LAMB'S WIFE. That there are new things in that Church is plain from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_21_5.htm">21:5</a>, where it is said, 'BEHOLD I AM MAKING ALL THINGS NEW.' These [new] things are therefore signified by 'My new Name,' which will be written upon them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 196</h4><p>196. And My new name, signifies the worship of the Lord alone, with new things which were not in the former church. That by "the name of the Lord" is signified all that by which He is worshiped, may be seen above, (<a href="81.htm">81</a>[1-4]) therefore here the worship of the Lord alone, with new things which were not in the former church. That in the New Church the Lord alone is worshiped, is evident from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">21:9-10</a>, where that church is called the "Lamb's Wife." That there are new things in that church, appears from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_21_5.htm">21:5</a>, where it is said, "Behold, I make all things new." Such therefore is the signification of "My new name," which was to be written upon them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 196 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>196. "Et Nomen Meum novum," significat cultum Solius Domini, cum novis quae in priore Ecclesia non fuerunt. Quod per "Nomen Domini" significetur omne per quod colitur, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_196/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_81" target=_top>81</a>); hic itaque cultus Solius Domini, cum novis quae non in priore Ecclesia. Quod in Nova Ecclesia cultus Solius Domini, patet ex capite <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_196/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_9-10" target=_top>21:9-10</a> <sup>1</sup>illa Ecclesia vocatur "Uxor Agni;" quod nova sint in Ecclesia, patet a cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_196/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_5" target=_top>21:5</a>, ubi dicitur, <p>"Ecce omnia Nova facio;" <p>haec itaque significantur per "Nomen Meum novum," quod scribetur super illos.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;9, 10 pro "8, 9" </p>
