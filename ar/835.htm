<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第835节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>835.“这两个就活活地被扔在烧着硫磺的火湖里”表所有像他们那样的人，都被投入地狱，那里有对虚假的爱，同时有对邪恶的欲望。“活活地”表示像他们那样的。“这两个”，就是“那兽和那假先知”，表示所有信奉唯信、内在邪恶的人，包括平信徒和神职人员，如刚才所述（<a href="834.htm">834</a>节）。“烧着硫磺的火湖”表示地狱，那些陷入对虚假的爱，同时陷入对邪的欲望之人便在那里。“湖”表示大量虚假，如下文所述。“火”表示爱，在此表示他们对虚假的爱。“火”表示正反两方面意义上的爱（参看<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="494.htm">494</a>，<a href="599.htm">599</a>节），在此表示对虚假的爱，因为经上说“火湖”。“硫磺”表示对邪恶、因而对虚假的欲望（<a href="452.htm">452</a>节）。下一章中类似的话论到“龙”和这两个，就是这些话：</p><p>那迷惑他们的魔鬼（就是龙）被扔在硫磺的火湖里，就是兽和假先知所在的地方；他们必昼夜受痛苦，直到永永远远。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.10.htm">20:10</a>）</p><p>要知道，从远处看，这类人所在的地狱就像一个火湖，冒出硫磺般的青色火焰。不过，身在其中的居民看不到这个现象；在那里，他们被关在自己的工房里，彼此激烈争吵；若不屈服，有时看似手中持刀进行威胁。正是他们对虚假的爱，连同对邪恶的欲望造成了这种火湖的表象。这种表象是出于对应。</p><p>“湖”表示有大量真理所在之处，因而在反面意义上表示有大量虚假所在之处；这一点从圣言明显看出来；从以下经文可以看出来，“湖”表示有大量真理所在之处：</p><p>在旷野必有水发出，在旷野的平原必有河涌流，干地必变为湖泊。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 35.6.htm"> 35:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 35.7.htm">7</a>）</p><p>我要使旷野变为水湖，使干地变为水泉。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 41.18.htm"> 41:18</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.33.htm">107:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.35.htm">35</a>）</p><p>我要使江河变为洲岛，使湖泊都干涸。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.15.htm">42:15</a>）</p><p>雅各的神叫磐石变为水湖，叫火石变为水泉。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗114.7.htm">114:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗114.8.htm">8</a>）</p><p>所有从灵魂之湖受雇的人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.10.htm">19:10</a>）</p><p>在以下经文中，则具有反面意义：</p><p>我必将名号和所余剩的人从巴比伦剪除，使她为麻鳽所得，又变为水湖。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 14.22.htm"> 14:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 14.23.htm">23</a>）</p><p>死亡和阴间也被扔在火湖里。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.14.htm">20:14</a>）</p><p>凡未发现记在生命册上的，都被扔在火湖里。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.15.htm">20:15</a>）</p><p>他们的份就在烧着硫磺的火湖里，这是第二次的死。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.8.htm">21:8</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 835</h4><p>835. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone. This symbolically means that all of them were cast as they were into the hell where their loves of falsity and accompanying lusts for evil are found.<p>Being alive means, symbolically, as they were. These two, namely the beast and the false prophet, symbolize all those people who have professed faith alone and are inwardly evil, both the laity and the clergy, as said just above in no. <a href="834.htm">834</a>. The lake of fire burning with brimstone symbolizes the hell where those people are found who are impelled by loves of that falsity and at the same time lusts for evil. A lake symbolizes an abundance of falsities, as will be seen below. Fire symbolizes love, here these people's love of falsity. Fire symbolizes love in both senses, good and evil, as may be seen in nos. <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="494.htm">494</a>, <a href="599.htm">599</a>, and here it symbolizes a love of falsity, because it is described as a lake of fire. Brimstone symbolizes a lust for evil and its accompanying falsities (no. <a href="452.htm">452</a>).<p>Something similar is said about the dragon and these two in the next chapter, in these words:<p>The devil (that is, the dragon) that deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. (<a href="3927/revelation_20_10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>)</p><p>[2] It should be known that the hell where people like this are appears at a distance as a lake of fire with a green flame like that of brimstone or sulfur. But those who are there do not see this. They are shut up in their workhouses where they vehemently argue with each other. Sometimes knives appear in their hands, which they brandish in a threatening manner to keep from yielding. It is their love of falsity together with their lusts for evil that occasions the appearance of such a lake. This appearance is produced because of its correspondence.</p><p>[3] That a lake symbolizes a place with an abundance of truth, and in an opposite sense, therefore, a place with an abundance of falsity, can be seen from the Word. A place with an abundance of truth from the following:<p>...waters shall burst forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert. The parched ground shall become a lake... (<a href="3927/isaiah_35_6.htm">Isaiah 35:6-7</a>)<p>I will make the wilderness into a lake of water, and the dry land into springs of water. (<a href="3927/isaiah_41_18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a>, cf. <a href="3927/psalms_107_33.htm">Psalms 107:33</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_107_35.htm">35</a>)<p>I will make the rivers into islands, and I will dry up the lakes. (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_15.htm">Isaiah 42:15</a>)<p>...the God of Jacob, who turned the rock into a lake of water, and the flint into a fountain of waters. (<a href="3927/psalms_114_7.htm">Psalms 114:7-8</a>)<p>...all who make payment from the lakes of the soul. (<a href="3927/isaiah_19_10.htm">Isaiah 19:10</a>)<p>In an opposite sense from the following:<p>I will cut off from Babylon the name and remnant..., and I will make it into a possession of the bird of prey, and into lakes of water. (<a href="3927/isaiah_14_22.htm">Isaiah 14:22-23</a>)<p>Death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. (<a href="3927/revelation_20_14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>)<p>If anyone was not found written in the Book of Life, he was cast into the lake of fire. (<a href="3927/revelation_20_15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a>)<p>...their part in the lake of fire burning with brimstone, which is the second death. (<a href="3927/revelation_21_8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 835</h4><p>835. 'These two were sent away alive into the lake of fire burning with sulphur' signifies that all those, just as they were, were cast into the hell where there are the loves of untruth and at the same time the lusts of evil.<p>By 'alive' is signified just as they were. By 'these two,' namely the beast and the false prophet, are signified all those who have made profession of faith alone and are interiorly evil, the laity as well as the clergy, as just above (<a href="834.htm">834</a>). By 'the lake of fire burning with sulphur' is signified the hell where those are who are in the loves of that untruth and at the same time in the lusts of evil. By 'the lake' are signified untruths in abundance, concerning which [something] follows. By 'fire' is signified love, here the love of their untruth. That 'fire' signifies love in both senses, good and evil, may be seen (<a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="494.htm">494</a>, <a href="599.htm">599</a>). Here it signifies the love of untruth because it is termed 'the lake of fire.' By 'sulphur' is signified the lusts of evil and consequently of untruth (<a href="452.htm">452</a>). A similar thing is said of 'the dragon' and of 'these two' in the following chapter in these words:<p>The devil (that is, the dragon) who led them astray was cast into the lake of fire and sulphur, where the beast and the false prophet are, and they shall be tormented day and night for ages of ages. <a href="3927/revelation_20_10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>.</p><p>[2] It is to be known that the hell where such are appears from afar like a fiery lake with a greenish flame as of sulphur. Those, however, who are therein do not see this. They are shut up there in their workhouses where they quarrel vehemently among themselves, and sometimes there appear in their hands knives with which they make threats rather than yield. It is their love of untruth together with the lusts of evil which causes the appearance of such a lake. That appearance is the result of correspondence.</p><p>[3] That by 'a lake' is signified where there is truths in abundance, and in the opposite sense where there is untruths in abundance, can be established out of the Word; where there is truths in abundance from these passages:<p>Out of the wilderness waters shall break forth, and rivers its the plain of the wilderness, and the dry places shall become a lake. <a href="3927/isaiah_35_6.htm">Isaiah 35:6-7</a>.<p>I will change the wilderness into a lake of waters, and the dry land into springs of waters. <a href="3927/isaiah_41_18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_107_33.htm">Psalms 107:33</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_107_35.htm">35</a>.<p>I will change the rivers into islands, and I will dry up the lakes. <a href="3927/isaiah_42_15.htm">Isaiah 42:15</a>.<p>The God of Jacob Who turns the rock into a lake of waters, and the flint into a fountain of waters. <a href="3927/psalms_114_7.htm">Psalms 114:7-8</a>.<p>All those making a profit out of the lakes of the soul. <a href="3927/isaiah_19_10.htm">Isaiah 19:10</a>.<p>In the opposite sense from these:<p>I will cut off from Babel the name and remnant, and I will make her into an inheritance of the bittern, and into lakes of waters. <a href="3927/isaiah_14_22.htm">Isaiah 14:22-23</a>.<p>Deaths and hell were cast into the lake of fire. <a href="3927/revelation_20_14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>.<p>Whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. <a href="3927/revelation_20_14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>.<p>Their part [is] in the lake of fire burning wills sulphur, which is the second death. <a href="3927/revelation_21_8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 835</h4><p>835. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone, signifies that all those, as they were, were cast into the hell where are the loves of falsity, and at the same time the lusts of evil. By "alive" is signified as they were. By "these two," namely, "the beast and the false prophet," are signified all those who professed faith alone, and were interiorly evil, both the laity and the clergy; as just above, (<a href="834.htm">834</a>). By "the lake of fire burning with brimstone" is signified the hell where they are who are in the loves of that falsity, and at the same time in the lusts of evil. By "a lake" is signified falsities in abundance, treated of in what follows. By "fire" is signified love, here their love of falsity. That "fire" signifies love both in the good and the evil sense, may be seen, (<a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="494.htm">494</a>, <a href="599.htm">599</a>); here the love of falsity, because it is said "a lake of fire." By "brimstone" is signified the lust of evil and thence of falsity, (<a href="452.htm">452</a>). The like is said of "the dragon" and of these two in the following chapter, in these words:<p>The devil (that is, the dragon), who seduced them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are; and they shall be tormented day and night for ages of ages, (<a href="3927/revelation_20_10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>).</p><p>[2] It is to be known that the hell where such are, appears at a distance like a fiery lake with a green flame as of brimstone.
