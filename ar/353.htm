<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第353节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>353.启7:6.“亚设支派中受印的有一万二千”表那些将属于主的新天堂和新教会之人所具有的相爱，也就是对向社群或社区行善用的爱。在至高意义上，“亚设”表示永恒；在属灵意义上，表示永恒的幸福；在属世意义上，表示对良善和真理的情感；此处“亚设”表示对致用之爱，这爱是那些在主的属天国度之人所具有的，在属天国度被称为相爱。这爱从对主之爱最近地降下来，因为主的爱就是向社群（community）和社群中的每个社区（society）致用，主通过那些爱祂之人行出这些功用。亚设具有上述含义，这一点可从他父亲以色列的祝福在某种程度上看出来：</p><p>论亚设说；他的粮食必肥美，他必给出君王的美味。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.20.htm">49:20</a>）</p><p>还可从摩西对他的祝福看出来：</p><p>愿亚设享受多子的福乐，得他弟兄的喜悦，他的日子如何，他的名声也必如何。（申记命33:24，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下6.25.htm">25</a>）</p><p>他还因祝福而得名；那些喜爱向社群和社区致用的人在天上所享有的福乐胜过其他所有人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 353</h4><p>353. Of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand were sealed. (<a href="3927/revelation_7_6.htm">7:6</a>) This symbolizes mutual love, which is a love of performing useful services to the community or society, in those people who will be part of the New Heaven and of the Lord's New Church.<p>In the highest sense Asher symbolizes eternity; in the spiritual sense, eternal bliss; and in the natural sense, an affection for goodness and truth. Here, however, Asher symbolizes a love of performing useful services, which is found among people who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom, and is called there mutual love. This love descends directly from love toward the Lord, since the Lord's love is to perform useful services to the community and to each society in the community, and He does these through the agency of people who possess a love for Him.<p>That Asher has the aforesaid symbolic meanings can be seen to some extent from the blessing he received from his father Israel:<p>As regards Asher, his bread shall be rich, and he shall yield royal dainties. (<a href="3927/genesis_49_20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>)<p>And from the blessing he received from Moses:<p>Asher is most blessed of sons; let him be acceptable to his brothers... As his days shall his fame be. (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24-25</a>)<p>His name, too, is derived from a word meaning bliss, and people who have a love for performing useful services to the community and society enjoy in heaven a greater state of bliss than others. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 353</h4><p>353. [verse 6] 'Out of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand sealed' signifies mutual love, which is the love of doing the good of use to the community or society, with those who will belong to the New Heaven and the Lord's New Church. By 'Asher' in the highest sense is signified Eternity; in the spiritual sense eternal blessedness; and in the natural sense the affection of good and truth. Here, however, by 'Asher' is signified the love of doing uses, which is with those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom and is there called mutual love. This love comes down next in order out of love directed to the Lord, inasmuch as the Lord's love is to do uses to the community and to every society in the community, and He does those uses by means of men who are in love directed to Himself. That the things stated above are signified by 'Asher' can in some measure be seen from his blessing by the father Israel:<p>Concerning Asher; his bread is fat, and he will give the delights of a King. <a href="3927/genesis_49_20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>; and from his blessing by Moses:<p>Let Asher be blessed in comparison with the sons, let him be accepted by his brothers, as his day so is his fame. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24-25</a>.<p>He was indeed named from BLESSEDNESS, and those who are in the love of doing uses to the community and society, in heaven are in a blessedness above the rest. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 353</h4><p>353. Verse 6. Of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand, signifies mutual love, which is the love of doing good uses to the community or society, with those who will be of the Lord's New Heaven and New Church. By "Asher," in the highest sense, is signified eternity; in the spiritual sense, eternal happiness; and, in the natural sense, the affection of good and truth; but here by "Asher" is signified the love of doing uses, which is with those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom, and is there called mutual love. This love descends proximately from love to the Lord, because the love of the Lord is to do uses to the community, and to each society in the community, and He does these by means of men who are in love to Him. That Asher has the above signification, may in some measure be seen from the blessing of his father Israel:<p>Of Asher; his bread shall be fat, and he shall give the dainties of a king, (<a href="3927/genesis_49_20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>).<p>And from his blessing by Moses:<p>Blessed above sons is Asher; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and as his day his fame shall be, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24-25</a>).<p>He was named also from blessing; and they who are in the love of doing uses to the community and to society, enjoy happiness above all others in heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 353 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>353. (Vers. 6.) "Ex tribu Ascheris duodecim millia signati," significat Amore in mutuum, qui est Amor faciendi bonum usus communi seu societati, apud illos qui e Novo Caelo et e Nova Ecclesia Domini erunt. - Per "Ascherem" in supremo Sensu significatur Aeternitas, in Sensu spirituali aeterna Beatitudo, et in Sensu naturali Affectio boni et veri; hic autem per "Ascherem" significatur Amor faciendi usus, qui est apud illos qui in Caelesti Regno Domini sunt, et ibi vocatur Amor mutuus; hic amor descendit proxime ex amore in Dominum, quoniam Amor Domini est facere usus communi et cuivis societati in communi, et illos facit per homines qui in amore in Ipsum sunt. Quod supradicta per "Ascherem" significentur, aliquantum videri potest ex benedictione ejus a Patre Israele: <p>"De Aschere: pinguis panis ejus, et ille dabit delicias Regis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_353/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_49_20" target=_top>Genesis 49:20</a>);<p>et ex benedictione ejus a Mose: <p>"Benedictus prae filiis Ascher, sit acceptus fratribus suis, sicut dies fame ejus," (Matthaeus 33:24, 25 [NCBSP: <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_353/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_33_24-25" target=_top>Deuteronomius 33:24-25</a>]).<p>Nominatus etiam est a Beatitudine; et illi qui in amore faciendi usus communi et societati sunt, in Caelo in beatitudine prae reliquis sunt. </p>
