<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第628节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>628.启14:7.“他大声说，应当敬畏神”表告诫不要作恶，因为这违背主。“大声”表示告诫；“敬畏神”表示不要作恶，因为这违背主。“敬畏神”是指通过害怕作恶而爱神，因为这违背祂，一切爱都含有这种敬畏在里面（<a href="527.htm">527</a>节）。如今这些话说给那些将属于地上新教会的人，是因为改造的第一步就是照十诫生活，十诫所数算出的那些恶都不可作。凡行这些恶的人，都不畏惧神；而凡因它们违背神而避开它们、不去行这些恶的人，既敬畏主，也爱主，如主自己在约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">14:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.24.htm">24</a>）所教导的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 628</h4><p>628. <a href="3927/revelation_14_7.htm">14:7</a> Saying with a loud voice, "Fear God." This symbolizes an admonition not to do evil, because it is to act against the Lord.<p>A loud voice symbolizes an admonition, and to fear God means, symbolically, not to do evil, because it is to act against the Lord. To fear God is to love Him, fearing to do evil because it is to act against Him - every love having this fear within it - as may be seen in no. <a href="527.htm">527</a> above.<p>This admonition is addressed now to people who will belong to the new church on earth, because the first step in reformation is to live according to the Ten Commandments, where the evils that are not to be done are listed. For anyone who does those evils does not fear God. But someone who does not do them, refraining from them because they are acts against God - such a one does fear God, and also loves the Lord, as the Lord Himself teaches in <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-24</a>. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"At that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you. He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him." Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, "Lord, how is it that You will manifest Yourself to us, and not to the world?" Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father's who sent Me." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 628</h4><p>628. [verse 7] 'Saying with a great voice, Fear God' signifies a warning not to do evils, because this is against the Lord. By 'a great voice' is signified a warning; and by 'to fear God' is signified not to do evils because this is against the Lord. That 'to fear God' is to love Him by fearing to do evil because it is against Him, and that all love has that fear within it, may be seen above (<a href="527.htm">527</a>). These things are said now to those who will belong to the New Church on earth, because the first thing of reformation is to live in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue, where the evils that ought not to be done are enumerated. For he who does those evils does not fear the Lord; but the one who does not do them, fleeing from them because they are against the Lord, fears and also loves the Lord, as He Himself teaches in <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-24</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 628</h4><p>628. Verse 7. Saying with a great voice, Fear God, signifies an admonition not to do evils, because this is against the Lord. By "a great voice" is signified admonition; and by "fearing God," is signified not to do evils, because this is against the Lord. That "to fear God" is to love Him, by fearing to do evil because it is against Him, and that all love has within it this fear, may be seen above, (<a href="527.htm">527</a>). These things are now said to those who will be of the New Church upon earth, because the first step of reformation is to live according to the commandments of the Decalogue, where those evils are recounted which are not to be done. For he who does them, fears not God; but he, who does them not, by shunning them, because they are against the Lord, the same fears and also loves the Lord, as He Himself teaches in John (chapter <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">14:20-24</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 628 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>628. (Vers. 7.) "Dicentem voce magna, Timete Deum" significat admonitionem ut non faciant mala, quia hoc contra Dominum est. - Per "vocem magnam" significatur admonitio; et per "timere Deum" significatur non facere mala, quia hoc contra Dominum est; quod "timere Deum" sit amare Ipsum, timendo facere malum quia hoc contra Ipsum est, et quod omnis amor illum timorem in se habeat, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_628/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_527" target=_top>527</a>). Haec dicuntur nunc ad illos qui e Nova Ecclesia in terris erunt, quia primum reformationis est vivere secundum praecepta Decalogi, ubi recensentur mala quae non facienda sunt; qui enim facit illa, ille non timet Deum; qui autem non facit illa, fugiendo illa quia sunt contra Dominum, ille timet et quoque amat Dominum, ut Ipse docet apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_628/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_2-24" target=_top>Johannem 14:2-24</a>. </p>
