<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>645.“向那坐在云上的大声喊着说，伸出你的镰刀来收割。因为收割的时候到了，地上的庄稼已经熟透了”表天堂天使向主的祈求，求祂终结并施行审判，因为现在是教会的最后状态。“向那坐在云上的大声喊着说”表示天堂天使向主的乞求，因为地上没有了对应之物；事实上，地上的教会之于天使天堂，如同地基之于安立其上的房屋，或如同两脚之于靠它们站立并行走的人；所以，当地上的教会被摧毁时，众天使就会哀痛，并向主乞求。他们乞求主终结该教会，并兴起一个新教会。正因如此，“天使向那坐在云上的大声喊着说”表示天堂天使向主的乞求。“那坐在云上的”表示主的圣言，或圣言方面的主（参看<a href="642.htm">642</a>节）；“伸出你的镰刀来收割”表示终结并施行审判（参看<a href="642.htm">642</a>，<a href="643.htm">643</a>节）。“因为收割的时候到了”表示教会已走到尽头了。“庄稼已经熟透了”表示这是教会的最后状态；“庄稼”表示教会在神性真理上的状态；原因在于，五谷（或粮，grain）通过收割获得，饼（或食物，bread）由五谷制成，而“五谷”（或粮）和“饼”（或食物）皆表示教会的良善，这良善是通过真理获得的。</p><p>这就是这段经文的含义，这一点从圣言中提及“收获”、“收割”或“镰刀”的地方看得更明显：</p><p>我必坐在那里审判列族；开镰吧，因为庄稼熟了；他们的罪恶甚大。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.12.htm">3:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>你们要将撒种的和收割时拿镰刀的都剪除了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 50.16.htm"> 50:16</a>）</p><p>巴比伦的女儿好像踹谷的禾场，再过片时，收割的时候就到了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 51.33.htm"> 51:33</a> ）</p><p>就像收割的人收敛站着的庄稼，用手臂割取穗子；到早晨使你的种开花，但在愁苦与极度伤痛的日子里，所收割的就只有一小堆。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛17.5.htm">17:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛17.11.htm">11</a>）</p><p>农夫惭愧，因为田里的庄稼都灭绝了。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥1.11.htm">1:11</a>）</p><p>耶稣对门徒说，还有四个月，收割的时候就到了，举目向田观看，庄稼已经发白。我差你们去收割。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.35.htm">4:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.38.htm">38</a>）</p><p>耶稣对门徒说，庄稼多，做工的人少；你们当求庄稼的主打发工人出去收祂的庄稼。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太 9.37.htm"> 9:37</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太 9.38.htm">38</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.2.htm">10:2</a>）</p><p>在这些经文，以及其它经文（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛16.9.htm">16:9</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.17.htm">5:17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.20.htm">8:20</a>）中，“庄稼”表示教会的神性真理，或神性真理方面的教会。</p><p>不过，包含在本章这几节，以及接下来那两章中的所有这些事，都是主以比喻对撒种的和收割庄稼的所作的预言；以下经文因教导并说明了它们表示什么，故加以引用：</p><p>耶稣说，天国好像人撒好种在田里，有仇敌来撒下稗子，到长苗吐穗的时候、稗子也显出来。仆人说，你要我们去薅出来吗？祂说，不必，恐怕薅稗子，连麦子也拔出来；容这两样一齐长，等着收割，当收割的时候，我要对收割的人说，先将稗子薅出来，捆成捆，留着烧；惟有麦子要收在我的仓里。门徒来到耶稣跟前说，请把这个比喻解释给我们。耶稣说，那撒好种的就是人子（或主）；田地就是世界（教会）；种子就是天国之子（教会的真理）；稗子就是那恶人之子（来自地狱的虚假）；撒稗子的仇敌就是魔鬼；收割就是时代的末了（教会的终结）；收割的人就是天使（神性真理）；将稗子薅出来用火焚烧，时代的末了（教会的终结）也要如此。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.24.htm">13:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.30.htm">30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.36.htm">36</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.43.htm">43</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 645</h4><p>645. Crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, "Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the hour has come for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth has dried." This symbolizes a supplication by angels in heaven to the Lord to bring things to an end and execute judgment, because the church had now reached its last state.<p>To cry with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud symbolizes a supplication by angels in heaven to the Lord, because they lacked anything corresponding to them on earth. For the church on earth is to the angelic heaven like the foundation on which a house rests, or like the feet on which a person stands and which he uses to walk. When the church on earth has been destroyed, therefore, the angels lament and supplicate the Lord. Their supplication is that He may bring the church to an end and raise up a new one. The angel's crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud accordingly symbolizes a supplication by angels in heaven to the Lord.<p>That He who sat on the cloud symbolizes the Lord in relation to the Word may be seen just above in no. <a href="642.htm">642</a>. That to thrust in a sickle and reap means, symbolically, to put an end to something and execute judgment - this, too, may be seen in nos. <a href="642.htm">642</a>, <a href="643.htm">643</a> above. For the hour has come to reap means symbolically that the church is at an end. For the harvest has dried means symbolically that the church has reached its last state. A harvest symbolizes the state of the church with respect to Divine truth. The reason is that a harvest yields the grain used to make bread, and grain and bread symbolize the church's goodness, which is achieved through truths.</p><p>[2] That this is the symbolic meaning of these words can be more clearly seen from passages in the Word where a harvest, reaping, or sickle are mentioned, as in the following:<p>...I will sit to judge all the... nations. Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe... For their wickedness is great. (<a href="3927/joel_3_12.htm">Joel 3:12-13</a>)<p>Cut off the sower..., and him who handles the sickle at harvest time. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_16.htm">Jeremiah 50:16</a>)<p>The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor...; a little while yet till the time of her harvest comes. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>)<p>It shall be when the standing grain of the harvest is gathered, and his arm reaps the ears... ...in the morning your seed flourishes..., the harvest a heap in the day of your possession and desperate sorrow. (<a href="3927/isaiah_17_5.htm">Isaiah 17:5-6</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_17_11.htm">11</a>)<p>Be ashamed, you farmers..., because the harvest of the field has perished. (<a href="3927/joel_1_11.htm">Joel 1:11</a>)<p>(Jesus said to His disciples:) "There are still four months until the harvest comes. ...lift up your eyes and behold the fields, that they are already white for harvest! ...I sent you to reap...." (<a href="3927/john_4_35.htm">John 4:35-38</a>)<p>(Jesus) said to His disciples, "The harvest... is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray... the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into His harvest." (<a href="3927/matthew_9_37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>, <a href="3927/luke_10_2.htm">Luke 10:2</a>)<p>In these places, and also in <a href="3927/isaiah_16_9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_17.htm">Jeremiah 5:17</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_8_20.htm">8:20</a>, the harvest symbolizes the church with respect to Divine truth.</p><p>[3] Everything contained in these verses in the present chapter, however, and also in the following two chapters, was foretold by the Lord in the parable of a sower and his gathering in of the harvest, and because it shows and illustrates what the symbolism is, we will quote it here:<p>(Jesus said:) "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; but... his enemy came and sowed tares... ...when the plants sprouted..., ...the tares also appeared....<p>"The servants said..., 'Do you want us to... gather them up?'<p>"But he said, 'No, lest while you gather up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, "First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn...." ' "<p>And His disciples came to (Jesus), saying, "Explain to us the parable...."<p>(Jesus) said...: "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man (or the Lord). The field is the world (the church), the... seeds are the sons of the kingdom (the church's truths), the tares are the sons of the evil one (falsities from hell), the enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the culmination of the age (the end of the church), the reapers are the angels (Divine truths). Therefore as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the culmination of this age (at then end of the church)." (<a href="3927/matthew_13_24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_13_36.htm">36-43</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 645</h4><p>645. 'Crying with a great voice to the One sitting upon the cloud, Put forth Thy sickle and reap, for the hour of reaping has come to Thee, because the harvest of the land has dried up' signifies the supplication of the angels of heaven to the Lord, that He may make an end and execute judgment because it is now the last state of the Church. By 'to cry with a great voice to the One sitting upon the cloud' is signified the supplication of the angels of heaven to the Lord by reason of there not being anything corresponding on earth. For the Church on earth exists for the angelic heaven, as the foundation upon which a house stands firm, or as the feet upon which a man stands and by means of which he walks. And therefore when the Church on earth has been destroyed the angels lament and make supplication to the Lord. They supplicate that He may make an end of the Church and awaken a new one. Consequently, by 'the angel cried with a great voice to the One sitting upon the cloud' is signified the supplication of the angels of heaven to the Lord. That by 'the One sitting upon the cloud' is signified the Lord as to the Word, may be seen just above (<a href="642.htm">642</a>); that by 'to put forth the sickle and reap' is signified to make an end and execute judgment, also above (<a href="642.htm">642-643</a>). By 'for the hour of reaping has come' is signified that it is the end of the Church. By 'because the harvest has dried up' is signified that it is the last state of the Church. By 'the harvest is signified the state of the Church as to Divine Truth. This is because it is the grain derived from the harvest out of which bread [is made], and by 'corn' and 'bread' is signified the good of the Church, this being procured by means of truths.</p><p>[2] That these things are signified by those [words] can be seen more clearly from the passages out of the Word where 'harvest,' 'reaping' and 'sickle' are mentioned, as in the following:<p>I will be seated for judging all the nations; put forth the sickle, for the harvest has ripened, for their wickedness is great. <a href="3927/joel_3_12.htm">Joel 3:12-13</a> [H.B 4:12-13].<p>Cut off the sower and the handler of the sickle in the time of harvest. <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_16.htm">Jeremiah 50:16</a>.<p>The daughter of Babel is like a threshing-floor, yet a little while, and the time of harvest shall come. <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>.<p>It shall come to pass when the standing corn of the harvest is being gathered, and his arm reaps the ears; in the morning thy seed flourishes, the harvest is a heap in the day of possession, and desperate, sorrow. <a href="3927/isaiah_17_5.htm">Isaiah 17:5-6</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_17_11.htm">11</a>.<p>The farmers were ashamed, because the harvest of the field perished. <a href="3927/joel_1_11.htm">Joel 1:11</a>.<p>Jesus said to the disciples, There are yet four months until the harvest comes, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are white for the harvest already. I have sent you to reap. <a href="3927/john_4_35.htm">John 4:35-38</a>.<p>Jesus said to the disciples, The harvest is plenteous, but the labourers are few, ask the Lord of the harvest that He may send forth labourers into His harvest. <a href="3927/matthew_9_37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>; <a href="3927/luke_10_2.htm">Luke 10:2</a>.<p>In these passages, and also. <a href="3927/isaiah_16_9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_17.htm">Jeremiah 5:17</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_8_20.htm">8:20</a>, by 'the harvest' is signified the Church as to Divine Truth.</p><p>[3] But all the things that are contained in these verses in this chapter, and also in the two chapters that follow, were foretold by the Lord in the parable about the sower and the gathering of the harvest, which will be quoted because it teaches and illustrates what they signify:<p>Jesus said, The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man sowing good seed in his field, but an enemy came and sowed tares; when the blade sprouted, the tares appeared also. The servants said, Dost thou wish us to gather them? but he said, No, lest while gathering the tares you uproot the wheat at the same time. Let them grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather first the tares and bind them into bundles for burning, but gather the wheat into my barn. And the disciples approached Jesus, saying, Explain the parable to us. Jesus said, He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man (or the Lord), the field is the world (the Church), the seed are the sons of the kingdom (truths of the Church), the tares are the sons of the evil one (untruths from hell), the enemy who sows them is the devil, the harvest is the consummation of the age (end of the Church), the reapers are angels (Divine Truths). In the same manner, therefore, as the tares are gathered and burnt with fire, so shall it be in the consummation of the age (at the end of the Church). <a href="3927/matthew_13_24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_13_36.htm">36-43</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 645</h4><p>645. Crying with a great voice to Him that sat on the cloud, send Thy sickle and reap; for the hour has come for Thee to reap, for the harvest of the earth is dried up, signifies the supplication of the angels of heaven to the Lord, that He would make an end, and execute judgment, because now is the last state of the church. By "crying with a great voice to Him that sat on the cloud," is signified the supplication of the angels of heaven to the Lord, because there was not anything corresponding on the earth; for the church on earth is to the angelic heaven, as a foundation is to a house which rests upon it, or as the feet upon which a man stands, and by which he walks; wherefore, when the church on earth is destroyed, the angels lament, and make supplication to the Lord. They supplicate that He would make an end of the church, and raise up a new one. Hence it is, that by "the angel cried with a great voice to Him that sat on the cloud," is signified the supplication of the angels of heaven to the Lord. That by "Him that sat on the cloud" is signified the Lord as to the Word, see above, (<a href="642.htm">642</a>); that "to send His sickle and reap" signifies to make an end and execute judgment, see above, (<a href="642.htm">642</a>, <a href="643.htm">643</a>). By "for the hour is come to reap" is signified that it is the end of the church. "For the harvest is dried up" signifies that it is the last state of the church; by "harvest" is signified the state of the church as to the Divine truth; the reason is, because from the harvest grain is procured, from which bread is made, and by "grain" and "bread" is signified the good of the church, this being procured by truths.</p><p>[2] That this is the signification of this passage, may be seen more clearly from those places in the Word where "harvest," "reaping" and "sickle" are mentioned, as in the following:<p>I will sit to judge all the nations; put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe; for their wickedness is great, (<a href="3927/joel_3_12.htm">Joel 3:12-13</a>).<p>Cut ye off the sower, and him that taketh the sickle in the time of harvest, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_16.htm">Jeremiah 50:16</a>).<p>The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor; yet a little while, and the time of harvest will come, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>).<p>It shall come to pass when the standing corn of the harvest is gathered, and his arm reapeth the ears; in the morning thy seed flourisheth, the harvest shall be a heap in the day of possession, and desperate sorrow, (<a href="3927/isaiah_17_5.htm">Isaiah 17:5</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_17_11.htm">11</a>).<p>The husbandmen were ashamed, because the harvest of the field perished, (<a href="3927/joel_1_11.htm">Joel 1:11</a>).<p>Jesus said to the disciples, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest, lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already to harvest.

Quod haec significentur per illa, clarius videri potest ex locis e Verbo ubi "messis," "metere," et "falx" dicuntur, ut in sequentibus: <p>"Sedebo ad judicandum omnes Gentes; emitte Falcem, quia maturuit Messis, quia magna est malitia eorum," (Joel 4:12, 13 (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_645/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joel_3_12-13" target=_top>3:12-13</a>));<p>"Exscindite seminantem et prehendentem Falcem in tempore Messis, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_645/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_1_16" target=_top>Jeremias 1:16</a>);<p>"Filia Babelis sicut area ad triturandum: adhuc parum cum veniet tempus Messis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_645/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_51_33" target=_top>Jeremias 51:33</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>"Fiet cum colligitur Messis seges stans, et brachium ejus aristas Metet; mane semen tuum efflorescit, acervus Messis in die possessionis, et dolor desperatus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_645/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_17_5" target=_top>Esaias 17:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_645/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_17_11" target=_top>11</a>); <sup>3</sup><p>"Pudefacti sunt agricolae, eo quod perierit Messis agri," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_645/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joel_1_11" target=_top>Joel 1:11</a>);<p>Jesus dixit ad discipulos, quod adhuc quadrimeste sit, donec Messis veniat; "tollite oculos vestros, et spectate agros, quod albi sint ad Messem jam jam; Ego misi vos ad Metendum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_645/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_4_35-38" target=_top>Johannes 4:35-38</a>); <sup>4</sup><p>"Jesus dixit discipulis, Messis multa est, operarii autem pauci; rogate Dominum Messis, ut mittat operarios in Messem Suam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_645/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_9_37-38" target=_top>Matthaeus 9:37-38</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_645/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_10_2" target=_top>Luca 10:2</a>).<p>In his locis, et quoque <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_645/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_16_9" target=_top>Esaias 16:9</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_645/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_5_17" target=_top>Jeremias 5:17</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_645/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_8_20" target=_top>8:20</a>, per "messem" significatur Ecclesia quoad Divinum Verum. Sed omnia quae continentur in his versibus in hoc capite, et quoque in binis capitibus quae sequuntur, a Domino praedicta sunt in Parabola de Seminante et de collectione Messis; quae quia docet et illustrat quid significant, adducetur: <p>Jesus dixit, "Simile est Regnum Caelorum homini seminanti bonum Semen in agro suo, sed venit inimicus et seminavit Zizania; cum germinavit herba, apparuerunt etiam Zizania. Servi dixerunt, Visne colligamus ea; ille vero dixit, Ne forte colligentes Zizania, eradicetis simul Triticum, sinite una crescere usque ad Messem; et tempore Messis dicam Messoribus, Colligite prius Zizania, et colligate ea in fasciculos ad comburendum, Triticum vero congregate in horreum Meum. Et accesserunt discipuli ad Jesum, dicentes, Expone nobis parabolam. Jesus dixit, Qui seminat bonum Semen est Filius Hominis" (seu Dominus), "ager est mundus" (Ecclesia), "semen sunt filii regni" (vera Ecclesiae), "zizania sunt filii illius mali" (falsa ab Inferno), "inimicus qui seminat illa est Diabolus, Messis est Consummatio saeculi" (finis Ecclesiae), "Messores sunt Angeli" (Divina Vera); "quemadmodum ergo colliguntur Zizania, et igne comburuntur, sic erit in Consummatione saeculi" (in fine Ecclesiae) (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_645/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_13_24-30" target=_top>Matthaeus 13:24-30</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_645/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_13_36-43" target=_top>36-43</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;642 pro "643"<p>2.&nbsp;33 pro "13"<p>3.&nbsp;5, 11 pro "5, 6, 11"<p>4.&nbsp;35-38 pro "35 ad 39" </p>
