<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第368节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>368.启7:10.“大声喊着说，愿救恩归与坐在宝座上我们的神，也归与羔羊”表发自内心承认主是他们的救主。“大声喊着说”表示发自内心的承认；“救恩归与坐在宝座上我们的神，也归与羔羊”表示主是拯救本身，所有人的拯救都来自祂，因而祂是救主。“坐在宝座上的和羔羊”表示唯独主；“坐在宝座上的”表示祂的神性，万有皆源于祂的神性；“羔羊”表示祂的神性人（参看<a href="273.htm">273</a>节）；这二者之所以都被提及，是因为祂通过万有所源于的其神性凭其神性人而成为救主。他们为一，这一点从经上说“宝座中间的羔羊”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.6.htm">5:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.17.htm">7:17</a>）的地方明显看出来。在圣言中，主经常被称为“拯救或救恩”，以此表示祂是救主；如：</p><p>我的救恩必不延迟，我在锡安施行救恩。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛46.13.htm">46:13</a>）</p><p>对锡安的女子说，看哪，你的拯救来到。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.11.htm">62:11</a>）</p><p>我叫你施行我的救恩，直到地极。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.6.htm">49:6</a>）</p><p>这是耶和华，我们素来等候祂，我们必因祂的救恩欢喜快乐。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛25.9.htm">25:9</a>）</p><p>在希伯来语，“拯救或救恩”被称为“Joschia”，就是耶稣。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 368</h4><p>368. And crying out with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!" (<a href="3927/revelation_7_10.htm">7:10</a>) This symbolizes an acknowledgment from the heart that the Lord is their Savior.<p>To cry with a loud voice symbolizes an acknowledgment from the heart. "Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb," means, symbolically, that the Lord is the true salvation, and that the salvation of all people depends on Him, thus that He is the Savior.<p>The one sitting on the throne and the Lamb symbolize the Lord alone - the one sitting on the throne symbolizing His Divinity from which all else flows, and the Lamb His Divine humanity, as also in no. <a href="273.htm">273</a> above. Both are depicted because the Lord was the Savior by virtue of His Divinity from which all else flows, by means of His Divine humanity. Their unity is apparent from places where the Lamb is said to be "in the midst of the throne" (<a href="3927/revelation_5_6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_7_17.htm">7:17</a>).<p>The Lord many times in the Word is called salvation, meaning that He is the Savior, as for example:<p>My salvation shall not linger, and I will place salvation in Zion. (<a href="3927/isaiah_46_13.htm">Isaiah 46:13</a>)<p>Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your salvation is coming." (<a href="3927/isaiah_62_11.htm">Isaiah 62:11</a>)<p>I have given You... to be My salvation to the end of the earth. (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>)<p>This is Jehovah whom we have waited for; we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation. (<a href="3927/isaiah_25_9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>)<p>The word for salvation in the Hebrew is yeshu'ah, the same as for the name Jesus. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 368</h4><p>368. [verse 10] 'And crying with a great voice, saying, Salvation (salus) to our God sitting upon the throne and to the Lamb' signifies acknowledgment from the heart that the Lord is their Saviour. 'To cry with a great voice' signifies acknowledgment from the heart; 'Salvation to our God sitting upon the throne and to the Lamb' signifies that the Lord is Salvation itself and that all salvation is from Him, thus that He is the Saviour. By 'the One sitting upon the throne and the Lamb' is understood the Only Lord; by 'the One sitting upon the throne' the Divine Itself from Which [are all things]; and by 'the Lamb' His Divine Human, as also above (<a href="273.htm">273</a>). Each of the two is mentioned because He was the Saviour from His Divine from Which [are all things] by means of His Divine Human. That they are one is plain from the places where it is said 'the Lamb in the midst of the throne' (chapters <a href="3927/revelation_5_6.htm">5:6</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_7_17.htm">7:17</a>). The Lord is very often called 'Salvation' in the Word, by which is understood that He is the Saviour; as:<p>My Salvation shall not tarry, and I will give Salvation in Zion. <a href="3927/isaiah_46_13.htm">Isaiah 46:13</a>.<p>Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy Salvation comes. <a href="3927/isaiah_62_11.htm">Isaiah 62:11</a>.<p>I will give Thee that Thou mayest be My Salvation to the end of the land. <a href="3927/isaiah_49_6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>.<p>This is Jehovah Whom we have awaited, we will exult and rejoice in His Salvation. <a href="3927/isaiah_25_9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>.<p>Salvation in the Hebrew language is termed 'Joschia,' which is 'Jesus. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 368</h4><p>368. Verse 10. And crying with a great voice, saying, Salvation to our God, that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, signifies the acknowledgment from the heart that the Lord is their Savior. To cry with a great voice, signifies acknowledgment from the heart; "Salvation to our God that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb," signifies that the Lord is salvation itself, and that the salvation of all is from Him, thus that He is the Savior. By "Him that sitteth upon the throne and the Lamb," is meant the Lord alone; by "Him that sitteth upon the throne," His Divine from which all things are, and by "the Lamb," His Divine Human; as may also be seen above, (<a href="273.htm">273</a>); they are both named, because from His Divine, from which all things are by means of His Divine Human, He was the Saviour; that they are one, is evident from the passages where it is said:<p>The Lamb in the midst of the throne, (<a href="3927/revelation_5_6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_7_17.htm">7:17</a>).<p>The Lord many times in the Word is called "salvation," by which is meant that He is the Saviour; as:<p>My salvation shall not tarry, and I will give salvation in Zion, (<a href="3927/isaiah_46_13.htm">Isaiah 46:13</a>).<p>Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh, (<a href="3927/isaiah_62_11.htm">Isaiah 62:11</a>).<p>I will give thee that thou mayest be My salvation unto the end of the earth, (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<p>This is Jehovah whom we have waited for, we will exult and be glad in His salvation, (<a href="3927/isaiah_25_9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>).<p>Salvation, in the Hebrew language, is called Joschia, which is Jesus. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 368 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>368. (Vers. 10.) "Et clamantes Voce magna, dicentes, Salus Deo nostro Sedenti super Throno et Agno," significat Agnitionem ex corde, quod Dominus sit Salvator illorum. - "Clamare voce magna" significat agnitionem ex corde; "Salus Deo nostro Sedenti super Throno et Agno" significat quod Dominus sit ipsa Salus, et quod omnium Salus sit ab Ipso, ita quod sit Salvator. Per "Sedentem super Throno et Agnum," intelligitur Solus Dominus, per "Sedentem super Throno" Divinum Ipsius a Quo, et per "Agnum" Divinum Humanum Ipsius, ut quoque supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_368/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_273" target=_top>273</a>); utrumque dicitur, quia a Divino Suo a Quo per Divinum Humanum Suum Salvator fuit; quod unum sint, patet a locis ubi dicitur Agnus in medio Throni, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_368/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_5_6" target=_top>5:6</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_368/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_7_17" target=_top>7:17</a>).<p>Dominus in Verbo multoties vocatur "Salus," per quod intelligitur quod sit Salvator; ut, <p>"Salus Mea non morabitur, et dabo in Sione Salutem," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_368/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_46_13" target=_top>Esaias 46:13</a>) <p>"Dicite in Sionis, Ecce Salus tua venit," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_368/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_62_11" target=_top>Esaias 62:11</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>"Dedi Te ut sis Salus Mea ad extremitatem terrae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_368/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_49_6" target=_top>Esaias 49:6</a>);<p>"Hic Jehovah Quem exspectavimus, exultemus et laetemur in Salute Ipsius," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_368/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_25_9" target=_top>Esajas 25:9</a>). <sup>1</sup><p>Salus in Lingua Hebraea dicitur "Joschia," quod est Jesus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;11 pro "2" </p>
