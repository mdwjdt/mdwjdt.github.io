<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第405节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>405.启8:9.“海中有灵魂的被创造之物的三分之一部分都死了”表那些一直并继续照这信生活的人无法被改造并接受生命。“三分之一部分”表示他们的全部，如前所述。“被创造之物”表示那些能被改造的人（<a href="290.htm">290</a>节）；原因在于，“创造”表示改造（<a href="254.htm">254</a>节）。“有灵魂”表示通过改造而能够接受生命；“死了”表示照着“唯信”生活者无法接受生命；之所以无法接受生命，是因为所有人都通过与仁联结之信、因而通过仁之信而得以改造，没有人能凭唯信而被改造，因为仁是信的生命。</p><p>由于在灵界，从远处看，灵人与天使的情感，以及由此而来的领悟与思维，显现为地上被称为走兽的各种动物或生物，空中被称为飞鸟的生物，和海中被称为鱼的生物之形状，所以在圣言中，经上经常提到“走兽”、“飞鸟”和“鱼”，它们并非表示别的；如以下经文：</p><p>耶和华与这地的居民争辩，因这地上无诚实，无仁慈，无认识神的知识；其中所有的居民、田野的走兽、空中的飞鸟必衰微；连海里的鱼都必汇集。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.1.htm">4:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.3.htm">3</a>）</p><p>我必除灭人和兽，与空中的鸟、海里的鱼，以及绊脚石和恶人。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.3.htm">1:3</a>）</p><p>以色列地必有大地震，甚至海中的鱼、天空的鸟、田野的兽在我面前震动。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.18.htm">38:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.20.htm">20</a>）</p><p>你派他管理你手所造的，使万物，就是田野的兽、空中的鸟、海里的鱼，凡经行海道的，都服在他的脚下。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗8.6.htm">8:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗8.8.htm">8</a>）</p><p>这些话论及主。</p><p>你且问走兽，走兽必指教你；又问空中的飞鸟，飞鸟必告诉你；海中的鱼也必向你说明。看这一切，谁不知道是耶和华的手做成的呢？（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯12.7.htm">12:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯12.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>此外还有其它经文。</p><p>“鱼”或“海中被创造之物”在此表示那些处于一般真理，因而喜爱属世之物超过属灵之物之人的情感和相应的思维；在上述和以下经文中，“鱼”表示这些人：</p><p>看哪，我一斥责，海就干了，我使江河变成旷野；其中的鱼腥臭，干渴而死。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛50.2.htm">50:2</a>）</p><p>埃及王法是卧在自己河中的大鲸鱼；你曾说，这河是我的，是我造的；我使你河中的鱼贴住你的鳞甲，我必将你和所有你江河中的鱼都抛在旷野。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.3.htm">29:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p>这些话是指着埃及王说，因为“埃及”表示与属灵之物分离的属世之物，因此他“江河中的鱼”表示那些处于教义，并由此陷入分离之信的人，这信只不过是知识而已；由于这种分离，所施行的神迹中就有这样一个：</p><p>他们的水变成血，于是鱼就死了。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出7.17.htm">7:17</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.29.htm">105:29</a>）</p><p></p><p>你为何使人如海中的鱼，用钩钩人，用拉网聚集他们。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈1.14.htm">1:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈1.16.htm">16</a>）</p><p>此处“鱼”表示那些处于一般真理，陷入与仁分离之信的人；但在以西结书，“鱼”表示那些处于一般真理，以及与仁结合之信的人：</p><p>他对我说，这水往东方边界流去，直到海，这河水所到之处，凡滋生的灵魂都必生活，并且有极多的鱼；必有渔夫站在河边撒网；那鱼各从其类，好像大海的鱼甚多。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.8.htm">47:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>马太福音：</p><p>耶稣说，天国又好像网撒在海里，聚拢各样的鱼。他们拣好的收在器具里，将不好的丢弃了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.47.htm">13:47</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.49.htm">49</a>）</p><p>耶利米书：</p><p>我要领以色列人再入他们的地，我要召许多打鱼的。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶16.15.htm">16:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶16.16.htm">16</a>）</p><p>因此，人若知道“鱼”表示这类人和事物，就能明白为何：</p><p>主挑选渔夫作祂的门徒，并说，来，跟从我，我要叫你们得人如得鱼一样。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.18.htm">4:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.19.htm">19</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.16.htm">1:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.17.htm">17</a>）</p><p>以及为何门徒在得主祝福后捕到一大堆鱼，并且主对彼得说，不要怕，从今以后你要得人了（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路5.2.htm">5:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路5.10.htm">10</a>）。同样明白为何当他们向主收丁税时，主叫彼得去海边钓鱼，从鱼得一块钱为祂自己和彼得纳税（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.24.htm">17:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.27.htm">27</a>）。还能明白为何主复活后，给门徒鱼和饼吃（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约21.2.htm">21:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约21.13.htm">13</a>）。并对他们说，你往全世界去，传福音给凡受造的（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可16.15.htm">16:15</a>）。因为他们使其归信主的“外邦民族”只拥有一般真理，并且关注于属世真理过于关注属灵真理。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 405</h4><p>405. And a third of the living creatures in the sea died. (<a href="3927/revelation_8_9.htm">8:9</a>) This symbolically means that those who had lived that faith and continued to live it could not be reformed and receive life.<p>A third symbolizes all such, as said above. Creatures mean people who can be reformed (no. <a href="290.htm">290</a>). The reason is that to create means, symbolically, to reform (no. <a href="254.htm">254</a>). Their living means, symbolically, to be able by reformation to receive life. That they died means, symbolically, that people who live that faith alone cannot receive life. They cannot, because people are all reformed by a faith united to charity, thus by a faith accompanying charity, and none by faith alone; for charity is the life of faith.</p><p>[2] Since in the spiritual world the affections and consequent perceptions and thoughts of spirits and angels appear at a distance in the forms of animals or creatures on the earth called beasts, of creatures in the air called birds, and of creatures in the sea called fish, therefore the Word so often mentions beasts, birds, and fish, which nevertheless have precisely the meaning stated. So for example in the following places:<p>...Jehovah has a quarrel with the inhabitants of the land, for there is no truth or mercy or knowledge of God... And everyone who dwells in it will waste away along with the beast of the field and the bird of the air; even the fish of the sea will be gathered up. (<a href="3927/hosea_4_1.htm">Hosea 4:1</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_4_3.htm">3</a>)<p>I will consume man and beast..., the bird of the heavens, the fish of the sea, ...the stumbling blocks along with the impious... (<a href="3927/zephaniah_1_3.htm">Zephaniah 1:3</a>)<p>There shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel, and the fish of the sea, the bird of the heavens, and the beast of the field... shall tremble before Me. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_38_18.htm">Ezekiel 38:18-20</a>)<p>You have made Him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet... the beasts of the fields, the bird of the air, and the fish of the sea that pass through the path of the seas. (<a href="3927/psalms_8_6.htm">Psalms 8:6-8</a>)<p>The latter is said of the Lord.<p>Pray ask the beasts, and they will teach you; or the birds of the air, and they will inform you...; and the fish of the sea will tell you. Who of all these does not know that the hand of Jehovah has done this? (<a href="3927/job_12_7.htm">Job 12:7-9</a>)<p>And in many other places as well.</p><p>[3] Fish, moreover, and creatures of the sea, as they are called here, mean the affections and consequent thoughts of such people as are concerned with general truths, and so who take more from a natural source than from a spiritual one. These people are meant by fish in the preceding passages, and also in the following ones:<p>By My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness; their fish stink... and die of thirst. (<a href="3927/isaiah_50_2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a>)<p>...the king of Egypt, a great whale, you who lie in the midst of your rivers, you said, "The river is mine; I made myself..".. (Therefore) I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales..., and I will leave you in the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_29_3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3-5</a>)<p>This was addressed to the king of Egypt, because Egypt symbolizes the natural level divorced from the spiritual one, and so the fish of his rivers mean people governed by doctrines, who because of them are caught up in faith separated from charity, a faith that is simply knowledge.<p>Because of that separation, moreover, one of the miracles in Egypt was the turning of their waters into blood, so that the fish died (<a href="3927/exodus_7_17.htm">Exodus 7:17-25</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_105_29.htm">Psalms 105:29</a>).</p><p>[4] Furthermore:<p>Why do You make mankind like fish of the sea...? Everyone draws them up with a hook, and gathers them in a net... (<a href="3927/habakkuk_1_14.htm">Habakkuk 1:14-16</a>)<p>Fish here stand for people concerned with general truths and caught up in faith divorced from charity. In contrast, fish stand for people concerned with general truths and governed by a faith conjoined with charity in Ezekiel:<p>He said to me: "These waters flowing to the eastern boundary... enter the sea, (from which comes) every living soul that creeps... and very much fish... ...fishermen will stand by it... with a spreading of their nets. Its fish will be of the same kinds as the fish of the Great Sea, exceedingly many. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_47_1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_8.htm">8-10</a>)<p>In Matthew:<p>(Jesus said,) the kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea, and they gathered (fish).... And they put the good ones into vessels and threw the bad away. (<a href="3927/matthew_13_47.htm">Matthew 13:47-49</a>)<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>I will bring (the children of Israel) back into their land... And I will send for many fishermen...(who) shall fish them. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_16_15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15-16</a>)</p><p>[5] Consequently, anyone who knows that fish symbolize people and things of the kind stated, can see the following: Why the Lord chose fishermen to be His disciples, and said,<p>Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men. (<a href="3927/matthew_4_18.htm">Matthew 4:18-19</a>)<p>Why the disciples, with the Lord's blessing, caught a huge multitude of fish, and the Lord said to Peter,<p>Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men. (<a href="3927/luke_5_2.htm">Luke 5:2-10</a>)<p>Why, when they wished to exact tribute from the Lord, He told Peter to go to the sea and draw out a fish, and to give them the coin found in it for Him and for himself (<a href="3927/matthew_16_24.htm">Matthew 16:24-27</a>).<p>Why, after His resurrection, the Lord gave His disciples fish and bread to eat (<a href="3927/john_21_2.htm">John 21:2-13</a>).<p>And why He told them to "go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature" (<a href="3927/mark_16_15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>). For the nations they were converting possessed only general truths, and were concerned more with natural things than spiritual ones. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 405</h4><p>405. [verse 9] 'And a third part of the creatures in the sea having souls died' signifies that those who have lived and are living that faith cannot be reformed and accept life. By 'a third part' all of them are signified, as above. By 'creatures' are understood those who can be reformed (<a href="290.htm">290</a>). This is because by 'to create' is signified to reform (<a href="254.htm">254</a>). By 'having souls' is signified to be capable of accepting life by reformation. By 'died' is signified that those who are living that faith alone are not capable. This is because all are reformed by means of faith united to charity, thus by the faith of charity and not any by faith alone, for charity is the life of faith.</p><p>[2] Since the affections, and consequently the perceptions and thoughts, of spirits and angels appear from afar off in the spiritual world in the forms of animals or creatures upon the land that are called beasts, of creatures in the air that are called birds, and of creatures in the sea that are called fishes, therefore beasts, birds and fishes are so often named in the Word, and yet by them nothing else is understood, as in these [instances]:<p>The controversy of Jehovah with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth (veritas), nor mercy, nor recognition of God; and everyone dwelling therein, the beast of the field and the bird of the heavens, even the fishes of the sea shall be assembled, <a href="3927/hosea_4_1.htm">Hosea 4:1</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_4_3.htm">3</a>.<p>I will consume man and beast, the bird of the heavens and the fishes of the sea, the stumbling blocks with the wicked, <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_3.htm">Zephaniah 1:3</a>.<p>There shall be a great earthquake upon the land of Israel, and the fishes of the sea, the bird of the heavens, and the beast of the field shall tremble before Me. <a href="3927/ezekiel_38_18.htm">Ezekiel 38:18-20</a>.<p>Thou hast made Him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under His feet, the beasts of the field, the bird of the air, and the fish of the sea, passing through the way of the seas. <a href="3927/psalms_8_6.htm">Psalms 8:6-8</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_8_7.htm">7-9</a>].<p>These [words are said] of the Lord.<p>Pray ask the beasts and they shall teach thee, or the birds of the air and they shall make known unto thee, and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. Who does not know by reason of all these that the hand of Jehovah has done this? <a href="3927/job_12_7.htm">Job 12:7-9</a>; besides in many other places.</p><p>[3] By the fishes, however, or 'creatures of the sea' treated of here are understood the affections and consequently the thoughts of those men who are in general truths, and who therefore take in more out of what is natural than out of what is spiritual. These are understood by the 'fishes' in the preceding quotations, and also in these following:<p>By My rebuke I dry up the sea, I set rivers in the wilderness; their fish stinks, and dies for thirst. <a href="3927/isaiah_50_2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a>.<p>O king of Egypt, the great whale that lies in the midst of thy rivers, thou hast said, The river is mine, I have made it myself; on account of this I will make the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will leave thee stranded in the wilderness, and every fish of thy rivers. <a href="3927/ezekiel_29_3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3-5</a>.<p>These things were said to the king of Egypt because by 'Egypt' is signified what is natural separated from what is spiritual, and consequently by 'the fishes of its rivers' those [are signified] who are in doctrinal things, and in a separated faith as a result thereof, which faith is only knowledge. On account of this separation, indeed, one of the miracles there was:<p>That their waters were turned into blood, and that consequently the fishes died, <a href="3927/exodus_7_17.htm">Exodus 7:17-25</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_105_29.htm">Psalms 105:29</a>.</p><p>[4] Again:<p>Wherefore makest thou man as the fishes of the sea, every one draws out with a hook <sup>1</sup>, and gathers into a net, <a href="3927/habakkuk_1_14.htm">Habakkuk 1:14-16</a>.<p>The fishes here [stand] for those who are in general truths and in a faith separated from charity; but in Ezekiel 'fishes' stand for those who are in general truths and in faith conjoined with charity:<p>He said unto me, These waters issuing out to the eastern boundary, they are coming to the sea, whence it comes to pass that every soul that creeps is living, and exceeding much fish; the fishers are standing upon it with a spreading out of nets; the fish thereof shall be according to their kind, as the fish of the great sea exceeding many. <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_8.htm">8-10</a>.<p>In Matthew:<p>Jesus said, The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a net cast into the sea, and they gathered fishes, and the good they put into vessels, but cast the bad away. <a href="3927/matthew_13_47.htm">Matthew 13:47-49</a>.<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>I will bring back the sons of Israel upon their land, and I will send for many fishers who shall fish them. <a href="3927/jeremiah_16_15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15-16</a>.</p><p>[5] He who knows, therefore, that such persons and things (tales ac talia) are signified by 'fishes' is able to see:<p>Why the Lord had chosen fishermen for His disciples, and had said, Come unto Me, and I will make you fishers of men. <a href="3927/matthew_4_18.htm">Matthew 4:18-19</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_16.htm">Mark 1:16-17</a>.<p>Why the disciples, by the blessing of the Lord, caught a prodigious multitude of fishes, and the Lord said to Peter, Do not be afraid, from henceforth thou shalt catch men. <a href="3927/luke_5_2.htm">Luke 5:2-10</a>.<p>Why the Lord, when they wanted to exact tribute from Him, said to Peter that he should go to the sea, and draw out a fish, and give the stater found in it for Himself and for him. <a href="3927/matthew_17_24.htm">Matthew 17:24-27</a>.<p>Why the Lord after the resurrection gave the disciples a fish and bread to eat. <a href="3927/john_21_2.htm">John 21:2-13</a>.<p>And said to them that they should go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature, <a href="3927/mark_16_15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; for the Gentiles whom they were converting were in general truths only, and in natural things more than in spiritual.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Reading hamo (with a hook) for homo (man). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 405</h4><p>405. Verse 9. (<a href="3927/revelation_8_9.htm">Revelation 8:9</a>) And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea that had souls died, signifies that they who have lived and do live this faith cannot be reformed and receive life. By "the third part" is signified all of them, as above; by "creatures" are meant those who can be reformed, (<a href="290.htm">290</a>); the reason is, because "to create" signifies to reform, (<a href="254.htm">254</a>). By "having souls" is signified to be capable of receiving life by reformation; by "they died" is signified that they who live that faith alone cannot receive life; the reason why they cannot is because all are reformed by faith united to charity, thus by the faith of charity, and no one by faith alone, for charity is the life of faith.</p><p>[2] Since the affections and thence the perceptions and thoughts of spirits and angels, in the spiritual world, appear at a distance in the forms of animals or creatures upon the earth, which are called beasts, of creatures in the air which are called birds, and of creatures in the sea which are called fishes, therefore in the Word mention is so often made of "beasts," "birds," and "fishes," by which nothing else is meant; as in these passages:<p>Jehovah hath a strife with the inhabitants of the earth, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God; and everyone that dwelleth therein shall waste away, the beast of the field, and the bird of the heavens; yea, the fishes of the sea shall be collected, (<a href="3927/hosea_4_1.htm">Hosea 4:1</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_4_3.htm">3</a>).<p>I will consume man and beast, the bird of the heavens and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the wicked, (<a href="3927/zephaniah_1_3.htm">Zephaniah 1:3</a>).<p>There shall be a great earthquake upon the land of Israel, and the fishes of the sea, and the bird of the heavens, and the beast of the field, shall tremble before Me, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_38_18.htm">Ezekiel 38:18-20</a>).<p>Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet, the beasts of the field, the bird of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the way of the seas, (<a href="3927/psalms_8_6.htm">Psalms 8:6-8</a>).<p>This is concerning the Lord:<p>But, ask now, the beasts, and they will teach thee; or the birds of heaven, and they shall announce to thee; and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.

But "fishes" signify those who are in general truths and in faith conjoined with charity, in Ezekiel:<p>He said unto me, These are the waters that go forth to the eastern boundary; they come to the sea, whence it is that every soul that creepeth liveth: and exceeding much fish; the fishers shall stand upon it to spread forth nets; its fish shall be according to their kinds, exceeding many like the fish of the great sea, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_47_8.htm">Ezekiel 47:8-10</a>).<p>In Matthew:<p>Jesus said, The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a net that was cast into the sea, and they collected fishes, the good they put into vessels, but cast the bad away, (<a href="3927/matthew_13_47.htm">Matthew 13:47-49</a>).<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>I will bring again the sons of Israel upon their land, and, I will send for many fishers, who shall fish them, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_16_15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15-16</a>).</p><p>[5] He that knows therefore, that such persons and things are signified by "fishes," may see why:<p>The Lord chose fishers for His disciples, and said, Come unto Me, and I will make you fishers of men, (<a href="3927/matthew_15_18.htm">Matthew 15:18-19</a>; <a href="3927/mark_1_16.htm">Mark 1:16-17</a>).<p>That the disciples, by the blessing of the Lord, caught an immense multitude of fishes, and the Lord said unto Peter, Fear not, from henceforth thou shalt catch men, (<a href="3927/luke_5_2.htm">Luke 5:2-10</a>).<p>Why the Lord, when they wished to take tribute of Him, said to Peter to go to the sea, and draw up a fish, and give the piece of money found in it for Himself and him, (<a href="3927/matthew_17_24.htm">Matthew 17:24-27</a>).<p>Why the Lord, after the resurrection, gave the disciples a fish and bread to eat, (<a href="3927/john_21_2.htm">John 21:2-13</a>).<p>And said to them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature, (<a href="3927/mark_16_15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>).<p>For "the nations" which they converted were only in general truths, in natural truth more than in spiritual.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original Latin has "homo" for "hamo," "man" for "hook." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 405 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>405. (Vers. 9.) "Et mortua est tertia pars creaturarum istarum in mari habentium animas," significat quod qui vixerunt et vivunt illam fidem non possint reformari et vita in accipere. - Per "tertiam partem" significantur omnes illi (ut supra); per "creaturas" intelliguntur qui reformari possunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_405/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_290" target=_top>290</a>); causa est, quia per "creare" significatur reformare (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_405/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_254" target=_top>254</a>); per "habentes animas" significatur posse per reformationem vitam accipere; per quod "mortua sint" significatur quod illi qui solam illam fidem vivunt, non possint; quod non possint, est quia omnes reformantur per fidem unitam charitati, ita per fidem charitatis, et non aliquis per fidem solam; charitas enim est vita fidei. Quoniam affectiones et inde perceptiones et cogitationes spirituum et angelorum in mundo spirituali e longinquo apparent in formis animalium seu creaturarum super terra quae vocantur bestiae, creaturarum in aere quae vocantur aves, et creaturarum in mari quae vocantur pisces, ideo in Verbo toties nominantur "bestiae," "aves," et "pisces," per quos tamen non aliud intelligitur;
