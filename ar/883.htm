<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>883.“祂要与人同住，他们要作祂的子民；祂要亲自与他们同在，作他们的神”表主的结合，该结合具有这样的性质，他们在主里面，主在他们里面。稍后会看到，“祂要与人同住”表示主与他们的结合；“他们要作祂的子民；神要亲自与他们同在”表示他们是主的，主是他们的；而且，“与人同住”表示结合，故表示他们将在主里面，主在他们里面，否则结合是不可能实现的；这就是结合的性质，这一点从主在约翰福音中的话很明显地看出来：</p><p>你们要住在我里面，我就住在你们里面。我是葡萄树，你们是枝子；住在我里面的，我也住在他里面，这人就多结果子。因为离了我，你们就不能做什么。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.4.htm">15:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p>到那日，你们就知道我在父里面，你们在我里面，我也在你们里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约 14.20.htm"> 14:20</a>）</p><p>吃我肉，喝我血的人住在我里面，我也住在他里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.56.htm">6:56</a>）</p><p>披上人身，与生来就在祂里面、被称为父的神性合一，其目的都是为了与世人的结合；这一点也明显可见于约翰福音：</p><p>我自己分别为圣，叫他们也因真理成圣。使他们都合而为一；正如我们为一，我在他们里面，你们在我里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.19.htm">17:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.21.htm">21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.26.htm">26</a>）</p><p>由此明显可知，与主神性人的结合是存在的，该结合是相互的，与被称为父的神性就是以这种方式，而非其它方式结合。</p><p>主还教导，结合是通过圣言的真理和照之的生活实现的（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">14:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.24.htm">24</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.7.htm">15:7</a>）。因此，这就是“祂要与人同住，他们要作祂的子民；祂要亲自与他们同在，作他们的神”所表示的。在其它出现类似这些话的地方也一样（如耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.23.htm">7:23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶11.4.htm">11:4</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结14.11.htm">14:11</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶24.7.htm">24:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶30.22.htm">30:22</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结11.20.htm">11:20</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结36.28.htm">36:28</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.23.htm">37:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.27.htm">27</a>；撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.8.htm">8:8</a>；出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.45.htm">29:45</a>）。</p><p>“要与人同住”之所以表示与他们的结合，是因为“住”表示出于爱的结合；这一点从圣言中的许多经文，以及众天使在天上的居所明显看出来。天堂被划分为无数社群，并且彼此照着属于爱的情感，无论总体还是细节，而各不相同。每个社群构成一种情感，其中的居民照着这种情感种类的亲密和关系程度而分别居住，关系最亲密的人住在同一座房子里；因此，“同居”一词论到已婚配偶时，在灵义上表示通过爱结合。要知道，与主结合是一回事，主的临在又是另一回事；只有那些直接靠近主的人才被赐予结合，其他人有主的临在。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 883</h4><p>883. "And He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. And He Himself will be with them their God." This symbolizes their conjunction with the Lord, which is of such a nature that the people are in Him and He in them.<p>His dwelling with them symbolizes a conjunction of the Lord with them, as we will see below. The people's being His people, and His being with them their God, symbolically means that they are the Lord's, and that He is their Lord. Moreover, because dwelling with them symbolizes conjunction, it symbolically means that they will be in the Lord and have the Lord in them. Otherwise there is no conjunction. That this is the nature of the conjunction is clearly apparent from the Lord's words in John:<p>Abide in Me, and I in you... I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing. (<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>)<p>And elsewhere:<p>At that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you. (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>)<p>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him. (<a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">John 6:56</a>)</p><p>[2] The Lord's assuming a humanity and uniting it with the Divinity He had in Him from birth, which is called the Father, had as its goal a conjunction with people, as is apparent also in John:<p>For their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified in the truth..., that they may be one as We are one: I in them, and You in Me. (<a href="3927/john_17_19.htm">John 17:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">21-23</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>)<p>It follows from this that the conjunction is formed with the Lord's Divine humanity, that it is a reciprocal one, and that this is the only means of conjunction with the Divine called the Father.</p><p>[3] The Lord also teaches that the conjunction is formed by the Word's truths and by living in accordance with them (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-24</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_7.htm">15:7</a>).<p>This, then, is what is meant by the Lord's dwelling with them and their being His people, and His being with them their God. So, too, elsewhere where the same words occur: <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_11_4.htm">11:4</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_14_11.htm">Ezekiel 14:11</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_24_7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_30_22.htm">30:22</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_20.htm">Ezekiel 11:20</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_36_28.htm">36:28</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_23.htm">37:23</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_27.htm">27</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_8_8.htm">Zechariah 8:8</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_29_45.htm">Exodus 29:45</a>.</p><p>[4] To dwell with them symbolizes a conjunction with them because to dwell symbolizes conjunction out of love, as may be seen from many passages in the Word. It may be seen also from the abodes of angels in heaven. Heaven is distinguished into countless societies, all of them different from each other in accordance with the differences in their love's affections, in general and in particular. Each society embodies one particular variety of affection, and the people in it have dwellings distinct from each other, depending on how close or akin they are within that variety of affection, and those who are the most closely related dwell together in the same house. Dwelling together, therefore, when said of married partners, symbolizes in the spiritual sense conjunction by love.<p>It should be known that conjunction with the Lord is not the same as His presence. Conjunction with the Lord is possible only with people who turn to Him directly, His presence with everyone else. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 883</h4><p>883. 'And He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and He Himself shall be with them their God' signifies the Lord's conjunction, which is such that they are in Him and He in them. By 'He will dwell with them' is signified the Lord's conjunction with them, concerning which [something] follows. By [the statement] that 'they shall be His people, and He Himself shall be with them their God' is signified that they are the Lord's, and the Lord is theirs; and because by 'to dwell with them' is signified conjunction, it is signified that they shall be in the Lord and the Lord in them, otherwise no conjunction is effected. That such is the case is clearly evident from the Lord's words in John:<p>Abide in Me and I in you. I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for without Me you cannot do anything. <a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>; and elsewhere:<p>In that day you shall recognise that I am in My Father, and you in Me and I in you. <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>.<p>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him. <a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">John 6:56</a>.</p><p>[2] That the assumption of the Human, and the uniting of It with the Divine that was in Himself from birth and is called 'the Father,' had for an end a conjunction with men is plain also in John:<p>For them I am making Myself holy, that they also may be made holy in the truth (veritas), that they may be one as we are one, I in them, Thou in Me. <a href="3927/john_17_19.htm">John 17:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">21-22</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>; from which it is established that the conjunction is with the Lord's Divine Human, and that it is reciprocal, and that thus and not otherwise there is a conjunction with the Divine that is called 'the Father.</p><p>[3] The Lord also teaches that conjunction is effected by means of the truths of the Word and by a life in accordance with them (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-24</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_7.htm">15:7</a>). This therefore is what is understood by 'He shall dwell with them and they shall be His people, and He Himself shall be with them their God.' In like manner elsewhere where the same words are (<a href="3927/jeremiah_7_23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_11_4.htm">11:4</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_24_7.htm">24:7</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_30_22.htm">30:22</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_20.htm">Ezekiel 11:20</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_14_11.htm">14:11</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_36_28.htm">36:28</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_23.htm">37:23</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_27.htm">27</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_8_8.htm">Zechariah 8:8</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_29_45.htm">Exodus 29:45</a>).</p><p>[4] The reason why by 'to dwell with them' is signified conjunction with them is because 'to dwell' signifies a conjunction out of love, as can be established from many passages in the Word; also from the dwellings of the angels in heaven. Heaven is distinguished into innumerable societies, the distinction among them all being in accordance with the differences of the affections that are of love, generally and specifically. Any one society is one species of affection, and they dwell there distinctly in accordance with the relationships and affinities of that species of affection, and in one house those who are most closely related. Consequently 'cohabitation' when said of married partners, in the spiritual sense signifies conjunction through love. It should be known that conjunction with the Lord is one thing, and His presence another. Conjunction with the Lord is not granted except to those who approach Him directly; to the rest, presence only. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 883</h4><p>883. And He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and He Himself shall be with them their God, signifies the conjunction of the Lord, which is such that they are in Him, and He in them. "He will dwell with them" signifies the conjunction of the Lord with them, as will be seen presently; "they shall be His people, and He Himself shall be with them their God" signifies that they are the Lord's, and the Lord theirs; and because by "dwelling with them" is signified conjunction, it signifies that they will be in the Lord and the Lord in them, otherwise no conjunction is effected; that this is the nature of conjunction appears clearly from the Lord's words in John:<p>Abide in Me, and I in you. I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in Me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without Me ye can do nothing, (<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a> In that day ye shall know that I am in My Father, and ye in Me, and I in you, (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>).<p>He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him, (<a href="3927/john_6_56.htm">John 6:56</a>).</p><p>[2] That the assumption of the Human, and the uniting it with the Divine which was in Him by birth, and is called the Father, had for its end conjunction with men, appears also in John:<p>For I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified in the truth; that they may be one; as We are one, I in them and Thou in Me, (<a href="3927/john_17_19.htm">John 17:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">21-22</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>).<p>From which it is plain, that there is a conjunction with the Lord's Divine Human, and that it is reciprocal, and that thus and not otherwise there is a conjunction with the Divine which is called the Father.</p><p>[3] The Lord also teaches that conjunction is effected by the truths of the Word, and a life according to them, (<a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-24</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_7.htm">15:7</a>). This therefore is what is meant by "He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and He Himself will be with them their God." In like manner in other places where the same words occur, as <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_11_4.htm">11:4</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_14_11.htm">Ezekiel 14:11</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_24_7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_30_22.htm">30:22</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_20.htm">Ezekiel 11:20</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_36_28.htm">36:28</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_23.htm">37:23</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_27.htm">27</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_8_8.htm">Zechariah 8:8</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_29_45.htm">Exodus 29:45</a>.</p><p>[4] The reason why "to dwell with them" signifies conjunction with them is because "to dwell" signifies conjunction from love, as may appear from many passages in the Word; also from the habitations of the angels in heaven. Heaven is distinguished into innumerable societies, one from another according to the differences of the affections which are of love in general and in particular, each society constituting one species of affection, and they dwell there distinctly according to the degrees of relationship and affinities of that species of affection, and they who are in the closest relationship dwell in the same house; hence "cohabitation" when spoken of married partners signifies, in the spiritual sense, conjunction by love. It is known that conjunction with the Lord is one thing, and His presence another; conjunction with the Lord is not given except to those who approach Him immediately, and His presence to the rest. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 883 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>883. "Et habitabit cum illis, at illi populi Ipsius erunt, at Ipse erit cum illis Deus eorum," significat conjunctionem Domini, quae talis est ut illi sint in Ipso et Ipse in illis. - Per "habitabit cum illis" significatur conjunctio Domini cum illis, de qua sequitur: per quod "illi populi Ipsius erunt, et Ipse erit cum illis Deus eorum" significatur quod illi sint Domini, et Dominus illorum; et quia per "habitare cum illis" significatur conjunctio, significatur quod illi in Domino erunt et Dominus in illis, aliter non fit conjunctio; quae quod talis sit, patet clare a Domini verbis apud Johannem: <p>"Manete in Me et Ego in vobis: Ego sum Vitis, vos palmites; qui manet in Me et Ego in illo, hic fert fructum multum, quia sine Me non potestis facere quicquam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_883/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_4-5" target=_top>15:4-5</a>);<p>et alibi: <p>"In die illo cognoscetis quod Ego in Patre Meo, et vos in Me et Ego in vobis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_883/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_20" target=_top>14:20</a>);<p>"Qui manducat Meam carnem, et bibet Meum sanguinem, in Me manet et Ego in illo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_883/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_6_56" target=_top>6:56</a>).<p>Quod assumptio Humani, et unitio ejus cum Divino quod in Ipso a nativitate erat et Pater vocatur, pro fine habuerit conjunctionem cum hominibus, patet etiam apud Johannem: <p>"Pro illis Ego sanctifico Me Ipsum, ut etiam illi sint sanctificati in veritate; ut sint unum sicut nos unum sumus, Ego in illis (et) Tu in Me," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_883/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_17_19" target=_top>17:19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_883/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_17_21-22" target=_top>21-22</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_883/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_17_26" target=_top>26</a>);<p>ex quibus constat, quod conjunctio sit cum Divino Humano Domini, et quod sit reciproca, et quod sic et non aliter sit conjunctio cum Divino quod Pater vocatur.

Caelum est distinctum in innumeras societates, omnes inter se secundum differentias affectionum quae sunt amoris in genere et in specie; unaquaevis societas est una species affectionis, et ibi habitant distincte secundum propinquitates et affinitates illius speciei affectionis, et in una domo qui propinquissimi sunt; inde "cohabitatio," cum de conjugibus, in spirituali Sensu significat conjunctionem per amorem. Sciendum est, quod aliud sit conjunctio cum Domino, et aliud praesentia Ipsius; conjunctio cum Domino non datur aliis quam qui Ipsum immediate adeunt, praesentia reliquis.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Ezech. pro "cap."<p>2.&nbsp;Jerem. pro "cap."<p>3.&nbsp;45 pro "15" </p>
