<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第783节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>783.启18:15.“贩卖这些货物，借着她发了财的客商，因怕她的痛苦，就远远地站着哭泣悲哀”表罚入地狱之前的状态，以及那时那些利用天堂喜乐的各种特许和承诺而获利之人的恐惧和哀恸。“贩卖这些货物的客商”，就是贩卖上一节所论述的“灵魂所贪爱的果子”，以及“一切的珍馐肥甘，和华美的物件”的客商，表示那些利用天堂喜乐的各种特许和承诺而富有，也就是获利的人。这些“客商”表示天主教教阶中的所有人，无论级别高低，他们便利用这些手段获利。其中就包括级别高者，这一点从本章23节经上说“你的客商原来是地上的大人物”明显看出来。“客商”表示级别低者，这一点可从11节经文（<a href="771.htm">771</a>节）看出来。“因怕她的痛苦，就远远地站着哭泣悲哀”表示他们处于远离罚入地狱的状态，甚至处在对惩罚的恐惧和哀恸中，如前所述（<a href="769.htm">769</a>节），那里说了同样的话。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 783</h4><p>783. <a href="3927/revelation_18_15.htm">18:15</a> "The merchants of these things, whom she made rich, will stand at a distance for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning." This symbolizes the state before damnation of those Roman Catholics who profited by various dispensations and promises of heavenly joys, and their fear and lamentation then.<p>The merchants of these things, namely of fruits that the soul longs for and things rich and splendid, which we considered in the verse immediately preceding this, symbolize people who by various dispensations and promises of heavenly joys have become rich, that is, who profited by them.<p>The merchants meant here are all those in the Roman Catholic hierarchy, both those higher in rank and those lower in rank, who have profited by these things. That they include those higher in rank is apparent from verse <a href="3927/revelation_18_23.htm">23</a> in this chapter, where it says, "For your merchants were the great men of the earth;" and that they include those lower in rank is apparent from verse <a href="3927/revelation_18_11.htm">11</a>, as may be seen in no. <a href="771.htm">771</a> above.<p>To stand at a distance for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, means, symbolically, when they are as yet in a state distant from one of damnation, and still at that time in a state of fear of punishments and in a state of lamentation, as in no. <a href="769.htm">769</a> above, where a similar statement is made. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 783</h4><p>783. [verse 15] 'And the merchants of these things who were made rich by her shall stand afar off for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning' signifies the state before damnation, and the fear and lamentation then of those who have made gain by various dispensations and promises of heavenly joys. By 'the merchants of these things,' namely of 'the fruits of the longing of the soul' and of the 'things fat and splendid' treated of in the preceding verse, are signified those who have become rich by means of various dispensations and promises of heavenly joys, that is, have made gain. By these 'merchants' are understood all in their ecclesiastical order, both the higher and the lower ones, who have made gain by such means. That the higher ones are included is plain from verse 23 of this chapter where it is said:<p>Because thy merchants used to be the great ones of the land.<p>That the lower ones [are understood also is plain] from verse it, as may be seen above (<a href="771.htm">771</a>). By 'to stand afar off for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning' is signified while they are still in a state remote from damnation, and even then in fear of the penalties and in lamentation, as above (<a href="769.htm">769</a>) where similar things are said. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 783</h4><p>783. Verse 15. The merchants of these things, who became rich by her, shall stand afar off for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, signifies the state before damnation, and then their fear and lamentation, who have made gain by various dispensations and promises of heavenly joys. By "the merchants of these things," namely, of the fruits of the soul's desire, and of fat and splendid things, treated of in the verse next preceding, those are signified who by various dispensations, and promises of heavenly joys, became rich, that is, who made gain. By these "merchants" all are meant, as well the higher and the lower in their ecclesiastical order, who made gain by such things. That the higher are included, is manifest from Verse 23 of this chapter, where it is said, "For thy merchants were the great ones of the earth;" that the lower ones also are included, from Verse 11; see above, (<a href="771.htm">771</a>). By "standing afar off for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning," is signified while they are still in a state remote from damnation, and still at that time in fear of punishments, and in lamentation as above, (<a href="769.htm">769</a>), where similar things are said. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 783 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>783. (Vers. 15.) "Mercatores horum qui divites facti ab illa, e longinquo stabunt propter timorem cruciatus ejus, flentes et lugentes," significat statum ante damnationem, ac tunc timorem et lamentationem illorum, qui per varias dispensationes et promissiones gaudiorum caelestium, lucrati sunt.--Per "mercatores horum," nempe fructuum desiderii animae, ac pinguium et splendidorum, de quibus in mox praecedente versu, significantur illi qui per varias dispensationes, et promissiones gaudiorum caelestium, divites facti sunt, hoc est, lucrati: per hos "mercatores" intelliguntur omnes tam superiores quam inferiores in ordine Ecclesiastico illorum, qui per talia lucrati sunt. Quod etiam superiores, patet a versu 23, hujus capitis, ubi dicitur, "Quia mercatores tui erant magnates terrae;" quod inferiores, a versu 11 <sup>1</sup>(<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_783/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_771" target=_top>771</a>); per "stare e longinquo propter timorem cruciatus, flentes et lugentes" significatur dum adhuc sunt in statu remoto a damnatione, et usque in timore tunc pro poenis, et in lamentatione, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_783/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_769" target=_top>769</a>), ubi similia dicuntur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;11 pro "10" </p>
