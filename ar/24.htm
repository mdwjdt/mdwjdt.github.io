<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>24.“祂驾着天上的云而来”表主将在圣言字义中揭示祂自己，并在教会的末了打开它的属灵之义。人若对圣言内义或灵义一无所知，不可能明白主所说“驾云而来”是什么意思。当大祭司命叫祂起誓，直言祂是不是神的儿子基督时，主对他说：</p><p>你已经说了，我是；你们要看见人子坐在那权能者的右手边，驾着天上的云降临。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.63.htm">26:63</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.64.htm">64</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.61.htm">14:61</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.62.htm">62</a>）</p><p>当主向门徒谈论时代的末了时，祂说：</p><p>那时，人子的兆头要显现，他们要看见人子有能力，有大荣耀，驾着天上的云降临。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.30.htm">24:30</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.26.htm">13:26</a>）</p><p>祂降临所驾的“天上的云”，无非是指圣言的字义，而他们要所看见祂的“荣耀”，无非是指圣言的灵义。这就是事实，那些不透过字义思考的人对此难以置信。对他们来说，“云”就是云彩。所以他们相信，当最后审判来临时，主会在天上的云彩里显现。然而，当知道何为“云”，也就是说它是指神性真理的表层，因而是指圣言的字义时，这种观念就会土崩瓦解。</p><p>灵界也有云彩，和尘世一样。但灵界的云出现在天堂之下那些处于圣言字义的人当中，或暗或明取决于他们对圣言的理解和接受的程度。原因在于，那里的天堂之光是神性真理，黑暗则是虚假。所以“亮云”是指被真理表象所蒙盖的神性真理，对那些处于真理的人来说，圣言的文字如同亮云；“乌云”是指被由确认的表象产生的虚假所掩盖的神性真理，对那些处于虚假的人来说，圣言的文字如同乌云。我经常看见这些云，它从何处来，是什么，显而易见。由于主荣耀了祂的人性后，在表层也成了神性真理或圣言，所以祂对大祭司说：“从今以后，你们要看见人子驾着天上的云降临。”</p><p>但祂对门徒说：“在时代的末了，人子的兆头要显现，他们要看见祂有能力，有大荣耀，驾着天上的云降临”，这句话意思是在教会末期，当最后审判发生之时，祂将显现在圣言中，揭示灵义。这一切其实已经成就了，因为现在就是教会的末期，最后的审判已经完成，这从最近出版的小书明显可知。因此，这就是启示录中“看哪，祂驾云而来”的意思，以下经文也是同样的意思：</p><p>我又观看，见有一片白云，云上坐着一位好像人子。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.14.htm">14:14</a>）</p><p>还有但以理书：</p><p>我在夜间的异象中观看，见有一位像人子的，驾着天云而来。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.13.htm">7:13</a>）</p><p>“人子”是指主的圣言，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》（<a href="../lord/19.htm">19</a>-28节）。</p><p>圣言别处的“云”也是指表层的神性真理，因而是指圣言的文字。这一点可见于提及去的其它经文，如这些经文：</p><p>没有人像耶书仑的神，祂乘在天空，腾云大显威荣。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.26.htm">33:26</a>）</p><p>你们当向神歌唱，赞美祂的名！颂扬那驾云者。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.4.htm">68:4</a>）</p><p>耶和华乘驾轻快的云。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.1.htm">19:1</a>）</p><p>“驾云”表示处于圣言的智慧，因为“马”表示对圣言的理解。谁看不出，耶和华不会驾云？</p><p>神骑着基路伯飞行，以天空的密云为祂的帐幕。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.10.htm">18:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.11.htm">11</a>）</p><p>此处“云”所表相同；“基路伯”也表圣言，可见下文（<a href="239.htm">239</a>，<a href="672.htm">672</a>节）；“帐幕”表居所。</p><p>耶和华在水中立楼阁的栋梁，用云彩为车辇。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.3.htm">104:3</a>）</p><p>“水”表真理，“楼阁”表教理，“车辇”表教义，所有这些因出于圣言的字义，故被称为“云彩”。</p><p>祂将水包在密云中，云在它们下面却不破裂；祂将云铺在祂的宝座上。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯26.8.htm">26:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯26.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>同样：</p><p>神使祂云中的光照耀。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯37.15.htm">37:15</a>）</p><p>你们要将能力归给神，就是云上的能力。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.34.htm">68:34</a>）</p><p>“云中的光”表圣言的神性真理，“能力”表其中蕴含神性大能。</p><p>路西弗啊，你心里曾说，我要升到高云之上；我要与至上者同等。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.14.htm">14:14</a>）</p><p>你离开吧，巴比伦，因为她将自己举升云霄。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.9.htm">51:9</a>）</p><p>“路西弗”和“巴比伦”表示那些亵渎圣言的良善与真理之人，所以此处“云”表示这些真理。</p><p>耶和华铺张云彩当遮盖。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.39.htm">105:39</a>）</p><p>耶和华必在锡安的一切居所上白天造云，因为在全荣耀之上必有遮蔽。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛4.5.htm">4:5</a>）</p><p>“云”在此处同样表示圣言的字义，这字义因其包含并遮盖灵义，故被称为“荣耀之上的遮蔽”。圣言的字义是一个遮盖，免得灵义受到损害，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/33.htm">33</a>节）一书；字义是一个守卫（<a href="97.htm">97</a>节）。</p><p>表层的神性真理，同圣言的字义一样，也由“云”来代表，如耶和华在云中降临西乃山，颁布律法（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.9.htm">19:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.5.htm">34:5</a>）。还有，耶稣变像时，有“云彩”遮盖彼得、雅各、约翰，对此，经上记着说：</p><p>彼得还在说话的时候，看哪，有一朵云彩遮盖他们，看哪，有声音从云彩里出来说，这是我的爱子，你们要听祂。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.5.htm">17:5</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.7.htm">9:7</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.34.htm">9:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.35.htm">35</a>）</p><p>主在变像时，使自己被看为圣言；因此有云彩遮盖他们，且有声音从云彩里出来说，祂是神的儿子。“有声音从云彩里出来”就是从圣言里出来。至于在相反的意义上，“云”表被歪曲了的圣言的字义，这从别处可以看到。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 24</h4><p>24. Behold, He is coming with the clouds (of heaven). (<a href="3927/revelation_1_7.htm">1:7</a>) This symbolically means that the Lord will reveal Himself in the literal sense of the Word and lay open its spiritual meaning at the end of the church.<p>Someone who knows nothing of the internal or spiritual meaning of the Word cannot know what the Lord meant by His coming in the clouds of heaven. For He said to the high priest who was adjuring Him to say whether He was the Christ, the Son of God,<p>As you have said... I am. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven. (<a href="3927/matthew_26_63.htm">Matthew 26:63-64</a>)<p>Moreover, in speaking to His disciples about the end of the age, the Lord said,<p>And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear..., and they will see (Him) coming in the clouds of heaven with power and... glory. (<a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>, <a href="3927/mark_13_26.htm">Mark 13:26</a>)<p>The clouds of heaven in which He will come mean nothing else than the Word in its literal sense, and the glory in which they will see Him, the Word in its spiritual meaning.<p>The reality of this can hardly be believed by people who do not think of the Word beyond the sense of its letter. To them a cloud is a cloud, and so they believe that the Lord will appear in the clouds of the sky when the Last Judgment is at hand. But this idea collapses when the meaning of a cloud is known, that it is Divine truth in its outmost expressions, thus the Word in its literal meaning.</p><p>[2] One sees clouds in the spiritual world just as in the natural world. However, clouds in the spiritual world appear beneath the heavens, in the region of people who are caught up in the literal meaning of the Word - clouds that are darker or brighter according to their understanding of the Word and at the same time acceptance of it. That is because the light of heaven there is Divine truth, and degrees of darkness falsities. Bright clouds, therefore, are Divine truth veiled in truthful appearances, like the Word in its letter with people who possess truths, while dark clouds are Divine truth wrapped in misconceptions affirmed on the basis of appearances, like the Word in its letter with people caught up in falsities. I have seen these clouds often, and their origin and nature have been apparent.<p>Now because, after the glorification of His humanity, the Lord became the embodiment of Divine truth or the Word even in its outmost expressions, He said to the high priest that thereafter they would see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven. <sup>1</sup></p><p>[3] Moreover, He said to His disciples that at the end of the age the sign of the Son of Man would appear, and that they would see Him coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory, <sup>2</sup>which symbolically means that at the end of the church, when the Last Judgment takes place, He will appear in the Word and reveal its spiritual meaning, an event that has occurred at the present day, because now is the time of the church's end and of the accomplishment of the Last Judgment, as may be seen from short works recently published. <sup>3</sup><p>This, then, is what is meant here in the book of Revelation by the declaration, "Behold, He is coming with clouds," and in the following one,<p>I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud One sitting like the Son of Man... (<a href="3927/revelation_14_14.htm">Revelation 14:14</a>)<p>As also in Daniel,<p>I was watching in the night visions, and behold..., the Son of Man coming with... clouds...! (<a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>)<p>To be shown that the Son of Man means the Lord in relation to the Word, see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord, nos. <a href="../lord/19.htm">19-28</a>.</p><p>[4] Clouds elsewhere in the Word, too, mean Divine truth in its outmost expressions, and so also the Word in its letter, as may be seen from passages there where clouds are mentioned, as in the following:<p>There is no one like the God of Jeshurun, who rides in heaven..., and in magnificence on the clouds. (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>)<p>Sing to God, praise His name; extol Him who rides on the clouds... (<a href="3927/psalms_68_4.htm">Psalms 68:4</a>)<p>...Jehovah rides on a light cloud... (<a href="3927/isaiah_19_1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>)<p>To ride on clouds means, symbolically, to possess the Word's wisdom, for a horse symbolizes an understanding of the Word. Who does not see that God does not ride upon clouds?<p>Similarly:<p>(God) rode upon cherubs..., (and) made... His canopy... the clouds of the heavens. (<a href="3927/psalms_18_10.htm">Psalms 18:10-11</a>)<p>Cherubs, too, symbolize the Word, as may be seen in nos. <a href="239.htm">239</a>, <a href="672.htm">672</a>, below. A canopy symbolizes an abode.</p><p>[5] (Jehovah) lays the beams of His dining chambers in the waters; He makes a cloud His chariot... (<a href="3927/psalms_104_3.htm">Psalms 104:3</a>)<p>Waters symbolize truths, dining chambers doctrinal tenets, and a chariot doctrine, all of which are called clouds, because they are derived from the literal meaning of the Word.<p>Similarly:<p>He binds up the waters in His clouds, and the cloud is not broken under them...; (and) He spreads His cloud over (His throne). (<a href="3927/job_26_8.htm">Job 26:8-9</a>)<p>...God... causes the light of His cloud to shine. (<a href="3927/job_37_15.htm">Job 37:15</a>)<p>Ascribe strength to God, ...strength upon the clouds. (<a href="3927/psalms_68_34.htm">Psalms 68:34</a>)<p>The light of a cloud symbolizes the Divine truth of the Word, and strength symbolizes the Divine power in it.</p><p>[6] (Lucifer,) you have said in your heart...: "I will ascend above the heights of a cloud, I will be like the Most High." (<a href="3927/isaiah_14_13.htm">Isaiah 14:13-14</a>)<p>Forsake (Babylon)..., for... she has lifted herself up to the clouds. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a>)<p>Lucifer and Babylon symbolize people who profane the goods and truths of the Word. Consequently those are things meant there by clouds.<p>(Jehovah) spreads a cloud for a covering... (<a href="3927/psalms_105_39.htm">Psalms 105:39</a>)<p>Jehovah has created above every dwelling place of Mount Zion... a cloud by day... For over all the glory there will be a covering. (<a href="3927/isaiah_4_5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>)<p>A cloud here, too, means the Word in its literal sense, which, because it encloses and covers the spiritual meaning, is called a covering over the glory. To be shown that the literal sense of the Word is a covering, to prevent its spiritual meaning from being injured, see <a href="../ss/33.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture 33</a>, and that it is a protection, no. <a href="../ss/97.htm">97</a>.</p><p>[7] Divine truth in its outmost expressions, which is the same as the Word in its literal sense, was also represented by the cloud in which Jehovah descended upon Mount Sinai and proclaimed the Law (<a href="3927/exodus_19_9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_34_5.htm">34:5</a>). Also by the cloud which covered Peter, James and John when Jesus was transfigured, concerning which we are told:<p>While (Peter) was still speaking, behold, a... cloud overshadowed them; and lo, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is My beloved Son... Hear Him!" (<a href="3927/matthew_17_5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>; cf. <a href="3927/mark_9_7.htm">Mark 9:7</a>, <a href="3927/luke_9_34.htm">Luke 9:34-35</a>)<p>In this transfiguration the Lord caused Himself to be seen as the Word, which is why a cloud overshadowed them and a voice was heard from the cloud, saying that this was the Son of God. The voice from the cloud means from the Word.<p>We will see elsewhere that in an opposite sense, a cloud means the Word falsified in respect to its literal meaning.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="3927/matthew_26_63.htm">Matthew 26:63-64</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;<a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>.<p>3.&nbsp;A reference probably to The Last Judgment (London, 1758) and A Continuation Concerning the Last Judgment and the Spiritual World (Amsterdam, 1763). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 24</h4><p>24. [verse 7] 'And He is coming with the clouds of heaven' signifies that the Lord is going to reveal Himself in the sense of the letter of the Word, and to open its spiritual sense at the end of the Church. He who knows nothing about an internal or spiritual sense of the Word is not able to know what was understood by the Lord by [His saying] that He is going to come in the clouds of heaven; for He said to the high priest, when he adjured Him to say whether He was the Christ the Son of God:<p>Thou hast said, I am; and you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand sides of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven. <a href="3927/matthew_26_63.htm">Matthew 26:63-64</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_61.htm">Mark 14:61-62</a>.<p>Also where the Lord speaks to the disciples about the consummation of the age, He said:<p>And then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man, and they shall see Him coming in the clouds of heaven with vigour (virtus) and glory. <a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_26.htm">Mark 13:26</a>.<p>By 'the clouds of heaven' in which He is going to come, nothing else is understood but the Word in the sense of the letter, and by 'the glory' in which they are going to see Him, the Word in the spiritual sense. That this is the case can scarcely be believed by those who do not think beyond the sense of the letter. With them, a cloud is a cloud, and as a result [there is] confidence that the Lord is going to make His appearance in the clouds of heaven while the last judgment is impending. This idea falls to the ground, however, when it is known what 'a cloud' is-that it is Divine Truth in ultimates, thus the Word in the sense of the letter.</p><p>[2] Clouds appear in the spiritual world just as they do in the natural world; but the clouds in the spiritual world appear below the heavens among those who are in the sense of the letter of the Word, darker or brighter in accordance with the understanding of the Word and its reception at the same time. This is because the light of heaven there is Divine Truth, and darkness there is [composed of] untruths. Consequently bright clouds are the Divine Truth veiled over with appearances of truth, such as the Word is in the letter with those who are in truths, while dark clouds are the Divine Truth covered all over with fallacies resulting from confirmed appearances, such as the Word in the letter is with those who are in untruths. I have often seen those clouds, and it has been plain whence and what they are. Now because the Lord, after the glorification of His Human, was made Divine Truth or the Word even in ultimates, He said to the high priest that 'from now on they were going to see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven.</p><p>[3] Moreover His saying to the disciples that 'in the consummation of the age the sign of the Son of Man was going to appear, and they were going to see Him coming in the clouds of heaven with vigour (virtus) and glory' signifies that, at the end of the Church when there is going to be a last judgment, He is going to make His appearance in the Word and reveal the spiritual sense. And this in fact has been accomplished, because now is the end of the Church, and the last judgment has been completed, as can be established from the little works recently published. <sup>2</sup>This, therefore, is what is understood here in the Apocalypse by 'Behold He is coming with clouds'; also in the following statements:<p>I saw, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud One sitting like unto the Son of Man. <a href="3927/revelation_14_14.htm">Revelation 14:14</a>.<p>As also in Daniel:<p>I was seeing (videns fui) in visions at night, and behold with clouds the Son of Man coming. <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>.<p>That by 'the Son of Man' is understood the Lord as to the Word may be seen [in] <a href="../lord/19.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD 19-28</a>.</p><p>[4] That also by 'clouds' elsewhere in the Word is understood Divine Truth in ultimates, and thence also the Word in the letter, can be seen from the passages there where 'clouds' are mentioned, as in these:<p>There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, riding in heaven, and in magnificence upon the clouds. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26-27</a>.<p>Sing unto God, praise His Name, extol Him riding upon clouds. <a href="3927/psalms_68_4.htm">Psalms 68:4</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_68_5.htm">5</a>].<p>Jehovah riding upon a light cloud. <a href="3927/isaiah_19_1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>.<p>'To ride upon the clouds' signifies to be in the wisdom of the Word, for a horse signifies the understanding of the Word. Who does not see that God does not ride upon the clouds? In like manner:<p>God has ridden upon a cherub and pitched His tent-the clouds of the heavens. <a href="3927/psalms_18_10.htm">Psalms 18:10-12</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_18_11.htm">11-13</a>].<p>Cherubs also signify the Word, as maybe seen below (<a href="239.htm">239</a>, <a href="672.htm">672</a>). A 'tent' signifies a habitation.</p><p>[5] Jehovah joins the beams of His reclining-couches in the waters, He makes a cloud His chariot. <a href="3927/psalms_104_3.htm">Psalms 104:3</a>.<p>'Waters' signify truths, 'reclining-couches' signify doctrinals, and 'chariot' signifies doctrine. All of these are termed 'clouds' because they are [derived] from the sense of the letter of the Word. In like manner:<p>He binds up the waters in His clouds, and the cloud is not broken under them; and He spreads His cloud over [His] seat. <a href="3927/job_26_8.htm">Job 26:8-9</a>.<p>God caused the light of His cloud to shine. <a href="3927/job_37_15.htm">Job 37:15</a>.<p>Ascribe strength unto God, strength upon the clouds. <a href="3927/psalms_68_34.htm">Psalms 68:34</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_68_35.htm">35</a>].<p>The 'light of a cloud' signifies the Divine Truth of the Word, and 'strength' signifies the Divine power there.</p><p>[6] Thou, Lucifer, hast said in thine heart, I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will become like the Most High. <a href="3927/isaiah_14_13.htm">Isaiah 14:13-14</a>.<p>Forsake Babel, for she has lifted herself up even to the clouds. <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a>.<p>By 'Lucifer' and 'Babel' those are signified who profane the goods and truths of the Word, therefore these [goods and truths] are the things understood there by 'clouds.'<p>Jehovah spread a cloud for a covering. <a href="3927/psalms_105_39.htm">Psalms 105:39</a>.<p>Jehovah has created upon every dwelling-place of Zion a cloud by day, for [there is] a covering upon all the glory. <a href="3927/isaiah_4_5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>.<p>Here also by 'cloud' is understood the Word in the sense of the letter, which sense, since it includes and covers the spiritual sense, is called 'a covering upon the glory.' That the sense of the letter of the Word is a covering lest its spiritual sense should be injured may be seen in <a href="../ss/33.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 33</a>, and that it is a guard (<a href="../ss/97.htm">97</a>).</p><p>[7] The Divine Truth in ultimates, which is like the Word in the sense of the letter, was also represented by the 'cloud' in which Jehovah descended upon mount Sinai and promulgated the Law (<a href="3927/exodus_19_9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_34_5.htm">34:5</a>). Again [it was represented] by the 'cloud' that covered Peter, James and John, when Jesus was transformed, concerning which [we read] these [words]:<p>While Peter yet spoke, behold a cloud overshadowed them, and behold a voice out of the cloud saying, This is My beloved Son, hear Him. <a href="3927/matthew_17_5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>; <a href="3927/mark_9_7.htm">Mark 9:7</a>; <a href="3927/luke_9_34.htm">Luke 9:34-35</a>.<p>The Lord in this transformation caused Himself to be seen as the Word, on account of which the cloud overshadowed them and the voice out of the cloud was heard [to say] that He is the Son of God. The 'voice out of the cloud' is out of the Word. That by 'cloud' in an opposite sense is understood the Word as to its sense of the letter falsified, will be seen elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 24</h4><p>24. Verse 7. Behold He cometh with the clouds of heaven, signifies that the Lord will reveal Himself in the literal sense of the Word, and will open its spiritual sense in the end of the church. He who does not know anything of the internal or spiritual sense of the Word, cannot know what was meant by the Lord that "He will come in the clouds of heaven;" for He said to the high priest, who adjured Him to say whether He was the Christ the Son of God:<p>Thou hast said I am; and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven, (<a href="3927/matthew_26_63.htm">Matthew 26:63-64</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_61.htm">Mark 14:61-62</a>).<p>And where the Lord speaks to His disciples of the consummation of the age, He says:<p>And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man; and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory, (<a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_26.htm">Mark 13:26</a>).<p>By "the clouds of heaven" in which He is to come, nothing else is meant but the Word in its literal sense; and by "the glory" in which they will see Him, the Word in its spiritual sense. That this is the case, is difficult to be believed by those who do not think beyond the sense of the letter of the Word; with such, "a cloud" is a cloud, and thence is their belief that the Lord will appear in the clouds of heaven, when the Last Judgment is at hand. But this idea falls, when it is known what "a cloud" is, and that it is the Divine truth in ultimates, thus the Word in the sense of the letter.</p><p>[2] In the spiritual world there appear clouds as well as in the natural world; but the clouds in the spiritual world appear beneath the heavens, with those who are in the sense of the letter of the Word, darker or brighter according to their understanding and reception of the Word; the reason is, that the light of heaven there is the Divine truth, and darkness there is falsities; consequently "bright clouds" are the Divine truth veiled in appearances of truth, such as the Word is in the letter with those who are in truths; and "dark clouds" are the Divine truths covered with fallacies and confirmed appearances, such as the Word is in the letter with those who are in falsities. I have often seen those clouds, and it was evident whence and what they are. Now because the Lord, after the glorification of His Human, was made the Divine truth, or the Word, even in ultimates, He said unto the high priest, that, "Hereafter they should see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven."</p><p>[3] But His saying to His disciples, that "in the consummation of the age the sign of the Son of man should appear, and that they should see Him coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory," signifies that at the end of the church, when the Last Judgment shall take place, He will appear in the Word, and reveal the spiritual sense, which is also accomplished at this day, because now is the end of the church, and the Last Judgment has taken place, as may appear from the small works recently published. This, therefore, is what is meant in Revelation, by "behold He cometh with clouds": also in the following passages:<p>I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, (<a href="3927/revelation_14_14.htm">Revelation 14:14</a>).<p>As also in Daniel:<p>I saw in the night visions, and behold the Son of man coming with clouds, (<a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>).<p>That by "the Son of man" is meant the Lord as to the Word, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord, (<a href="19.htm">19-28</a>).</p><p>[4] That also by "clouds" in other parts of the Word, is meant the Divine truth in ultimates, and thence the Word in the letter, may be seen in other passages where clouds are mentioned; as in these:<p>There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven, and in magnificence upon the clouds, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>).<p>Sing unto God, praise His name, extol Him that rideth upon the clouds, (<a href="3927/psalms_68_4.htm">Psalms 68:4</a>).<p>Jehovah rideth upon a light cloud, (<a href="3927/isaiah_19_1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>).<p>"To ride upon the clouds," signifies to be in the wisdom of the Word, for "a horse" signifies the understanding of the Word; who cannot see that Jehovah does not ride upon the clouds?<p>God rode upon a cherub, and placed the clouds of the heavens His tent, (<a href="3927/psalms_18_10.htm">Psalms 18:10-11</a>).<p>Here there is a similar signification; "cherubs" also signify the Word, as may be seen below, (<a href="239.htm">239</a>, <a href="672.htm">672</a>); tent signifies a habitation.</p><p>[5] Jehovah layeth the beams of His chambers in the waters, He maketh the cloud His chariot, (<a href="3927/psalms_104_3.htm">Psalms 104:3</a>).<p>"Waters" signify truths, "chambers" signify doctrinals, and "chariot" doctrine, all which, because they are from the sense of the letter of the Word, are called "clouds."<p>He bindeth up the waters in His clouds, and the cloud is not broken under them; He spreadeth His cloud over His throne, (<a href="3927/job_26_8.htm">Job 26:8-9</a> In like manner:<p>God caused the light of His cloud to shine, (<a href="3927/job_37_15.htm">Job 37:15</a>).<p>Give ye strength unto God, strength upon the clouds, (<a href="3927/psalms_68_34.htm">Psalms 68:34</a>).<p>"The light of a cloud" signifies the Divine truth of the Word, and "strength" signifies Divine power there.</p><p>[6] Thou, O Lucifer, hast said in thine heart, I will ascend above the heights of the cloud; I will become like the Most High, (<a href="3927/isaiah_14_14.htm">Isaiah 14:14</a>).<p>Forsake ye, Babylon, for she hath lifted herself up even to the clouds, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a>).<p>By "Lucifer," and "Babylon" are signified those who profane the goods and truths of the Word, therefore these truths are meant there by "clouds."<p>Jehovah spread a cloud for a covering, (<a href="3927/psalms_105_39.htm">Psalms 105:39</a>).<p>Jehovah createth upon every habitation of Zion a cloud by day, for upon all the glory shall be a covering, (<a href="3927/isaiah_4_5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>).<p>Here, also, by "cloud," is meant the Word in the sense of the letter, which sense, as it includes and covers the spiritual sense, is called "a covering upon the glory." That the literal sense of the Word is a covering, lest its spiritual sense should be injured, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, (<a href="33.htm">33</a>); and that it is a guard, (<a href="97.htm">97</a>).</p><p>[7] The Divine truth in ultimates, which is the same with the Word in the sense of the letter, is also represented by the "cloud," in which Jehovah descended upon Mount Sinai, and promulgated the law, (<a href="3927/exodus_19_9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_34_5.htm">34:5</a>). Also by the "cloud" which covered Peter, James, and John, when Jesus was transfigured, concerning which it is written:<p>While Peter yet spake, behold a cloud overshadowed them, and behold a voice out of the cloud saying, This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him, (<a href="3927/matthew_17_5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>; <a href="3927/mark_9_7.htm">Mark 9:7</a>; <a href="3927/luke_9_34.htm">Luke 9:34-35</a>).<p>The Lord in this transfiguration, caused Himself to be seen as the Word; therefore a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice was heard out of the cloud, that He is the Son of God; "the voice out of the cloud" is out of the Word. That by "cloud," in the opposite sense, is meant the Word as to the sense of the letter falsified, will be seen elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 24 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>24. (Vers. 7.) "Et venit cum nubibus" Caeli, significat quod Dominus Se revelaturus sit in Sensu literae Verbi, et aperiturus Sensum spiritualem ejus in fine Ecclesiae. -Qui nihil de Sensu interno seu spirituali Verbi novit, non scire potest quid intellectum est a Domino per quod "venturus sit in Nubibus Caeli;" dixit enim ad Sacerdotem magnum adjurantem Ipsum ut diceret num esset Christus Filius Dei, <p>"Tu dixisti, Ego sum; et videbitis Filium Hominis sedentem a dextris potentiae, et venientem cum Nubibus Caeli," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_26_63-64" target=_top>Matthaeus 26:63-64</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_14_61-62" target=_top>Marcus 14:61-62</a>);<p>et ubi Dominus de consummatione saeculi loquitur ad discipulos, dixit, <p>"Et tunc apparebit signum Filii Hominis, et videbunt Ipsum venientem in Nubibus Caeli cum virtute et gloria," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_30" target=_top>Matthaeus 24:30</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_13_26" target=_top>Marcus 13:26</a>);<p>per "Nubem Caeli," in qua venturus est, non aliud intelligitur, quam Verbum in Sensu literae; et per "Gloriam," in qua Ipsum visuri sunt, Verbum in Sensu spirituali. Quod ita sit, aegre potest credi ab illis, qui non ultra Sensum literae Verbi cogitant; illis "Nubes" est nubes, et inde fides quod Dominus appariturus sit in nubibus Caeli, dum instat Ultimum Judicium; sed hoc cadit, cum scitur quid "Nubes," quod Sit Divinum Verum in ultimis, ita Verbum in Sensu literae. In Mundo Spirituali aeque apparent Nubes ut in Mundo naturali; sed Nubes in Mundo Spirituali apparent infra Caelos apud illos qui in Sensu literae Verbi sunt, obscuriores et lucidiores secundum intellectum Verbi et simul receptionem; causa est, quia Lux Caeli ibi est Divinum Verum, ac Tenebrae ibi sunt falsa; inde "Nubes lucidae" sunt Divinum Verum obvelatum apparentiis veri, quale est Verbum in litera apud illos qui in veris sunt, ac "Nubes obscurae" Divinum Verum circumtectum fallaciis ex apparentiis confirmatis, quale est Verbum in litera apud illos qui in falsis sunt; vidi illas Nubes Saepe, et patuit unde et quid sunt. Nunc quia Dominus post glorificationem Humani Sui factus est Divinum Verum seu Verbum etiam in ultimis, dixit ad summum Sacerdotem, quod Ex nunc visuri sint Filium Hominis venientem in nubibus Caeli. <p>Quod autem dixerit ad Discipulos, quod in consummatione saeculi Appariturum sit signum Filii Hominis, et quod visuri sint Ipsum venientem in Nubibus Caeli cum virtute et gloria, <p>significat quod in fine Ecclesiae, quando ultimum Judicium futurum est, appariturus sit in Verbo, et revelaturus Sensum spiritualem; quod etiam hodie factum est, quia nunc est finis Ecclesiae, ac Ultimum Judicium peractum, ut constare potest ex Opusculis nuper editis: hoc itaque est quod hic in Apocalypsi intelligitur, per "Ecce venit cum Nubibus;" <p>tum in sequentibus, <p>"Vidi et ecce Nubes alba, et super Nube sedens similis Filio Hominis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_14_14" target=_top>Apocalypsis 14:14</a>);<p>ut et apud Danielem: <p>"Videns fui in visionibus noctis, et ecce cum Nubibus Filius Hominis veniens," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_7_13" target=_top>7:13</a>);<p>quod per "Filium Hominis" intelligatur Dominus quoad Verbum, videatur Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_19" target=_top>19-28</a>). Quod per "Nubes" etiam alibi in Verbo intelligatur Divinum Verum in ultimis, et inde quoque Verbum in litera, videri potest ex locis ibi, ubi Nubes leguntur, ut in his: <p>"Non sicut Deus Jeschurun, equitans in Caelo, et in magnificentia super Nubibus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_33_26" target=_top>Deuteronomius 33:26</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>"Cantate Deo, laudate Nomen Ipsius, extollite equitantem super Nubibus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_68_5" target=_top>Psalm 68:5</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_68_4" target=_top>4</a>));<p>"Jehovah equitans super Nube levi," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_19_1" target=_top>Esaias 19:1</a>);<p>"equitare super nubibus" significat in sapientia Verbi esse, "Equus" enim significat intellectum Verbi; quis non videt quod Deus non equitet super nubibus. <p>"Deus equitavit super Cherubis, et posuit tentorium Suum Nubes Caelorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_18_11-12" target=_top>Psalm 18:11-12</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_18_10-11" target=_top>10-11</a>)); <sup>1</sup>similiter; <p>etiam "Cherubi" significant Verbum, videatur infra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_239" target=_top>239</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_672" target=_top>672</a>); "tentorium" significat habitationem. <p>"Jehovah contignat aquis triclinia Sua, ponit Nubem currum Suum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_104_3" target=_top>Psalm 104:3</a>);<p>"aquae" significant vera, "triclinia" doctrinalia, et "currus" doctrinam, quae omnia, quia ex Sensu literae Verbi sunt, dicuntur "Nubes." <p>"Ligat aquas in Nubibus Suis, et non rumpitur Nubes sub illis; et expandit super solium Nubem Suam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_job_26_8-9" target=_top>Hiob 26:8-9</a>); similiter. <p>"Deus splendere facit lucem Nubis Suae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_job_37_15" target=_top>Hiob 37:15</a>); <sup>3</sup><p>"Date robur Deo, robur super Nubibus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_68_35" target=_top>Psalm 68:35</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_68_34" target=_top>34</a>));<p>"lux nubis" significat Divinum Verum Verbi, ac "robur" significat Divinam potentiam ibi. <p>"Lucifer, dixisti in corde tuo, Ascendam super excelsa Nubis, similis fiam Altissimo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_14_14" target=_top>Esaias 14:14</a>);<p>"Deserite Babelem, quia extulit se usque ad Nubes," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_51_9" target=_top>Jeremias 51:9</a>);<p>per "Luciferum" et "Babelem" significantur qui prophanant bona et vera Verbi; quare haec sunt quae per "Nubes" ibi intelliguntur. <p>"Jehovah expandit Nubem in tegumentum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_105_39" target=_top>Psalm 105:39</a>);<p>"Creavit Jehovah super omne habitaculum Zionis Nubem interdiu, nam super omnia Gloria obtegumentum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_4_5" target=_top>Esaias 4:5</a>);<p>per "Nubem etiam hic intelligitur Verbum in Sensu literae, qui Sensus quia includit et tegit Sensum spiritualem, vocatur "tegumentum super gloriam;" quod Sensus literae Verbi sit "tegumentum," ne laedatur Sensus spiritualis ejus, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_33" target=_top>Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 33</a>; et quod sit "custodia," <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_97" target=_top>97</a>.
