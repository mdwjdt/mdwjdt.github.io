<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第856节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>856.启20:7.“那一千年完了，撒但必从监牢里被释放”表那些此前一直在低地被隐藏并看顾的人被主接升天堂，基督新天堂因他们得以增长后，所有那些确认信之虚假的人就会被释放。“那一千年完了”表示那些至今仍在低地被隐藏和看顾的人被主接升天堂后。“那一千年完了”之所以具有这种含义，是因为此前4至6节唯独论述了那些敬拜主，并照其诫命生活之人的得救，这个时间段就是“一千年”所指的。诚然，这里没有说他们从低地被接升上去，然而这一点从前文（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.9.htm">6:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.11.htm">11</a>）明显可知，那里说他们被看到“在祭坛底下”，“在祭坛底下”就表示低地；所以，他们在此也被称为“神和基督的祭司”（｛20:6，｛854节）。此处也没有说，基督新天堂因他们得以增长，尽管这一点从论述基督新天堂的14章很明显地看出来，对此，可参看那里所给出的解读（尤其<a href="612.htm">612</a>，<a href="613.htm">613</a>，<a href="626.htm">626</a>，<a href="631.htm">631</a>，<a href="647.htm">647</a>，<a href="659.htm">659</a>，<a href="661.htm">661</a>节）。“撒但从监牢里被释放”之所以表示那些在教义上确认唯信的人要被释放，是因为那“龙”在此被称作“撒但”，没有像之前那样同时被称作“魔鬼”（｛20:2）；作为“魔鬼”的“龙”表示那些陷入生活的邪恶之人，而作为“撒但”的“龙”表示那些陷入信仰的虚假之人（<a href="841.htm">841</a>节）；至于各自的性质，可参看下一节。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 856</h4><p>856. <a href="3927/revelation_20_7.htm">20:7</a> Then, when the thousand years have been completed, Satan will be released from his prison. This symbolically means that after the Lord raised into heaven those who previously had been hidden away and protected in the lower earth, and the New Christian Heaven was increased by their number, all those who had confirmed themselves in falsities of faith were let loose.<p>When the thousand years have been completed means, symbolically, after the Lord raised into heaven those who previously had been hidden away and protected in the lower earth. When the thousand years have been completed has this symbolic meaning because the sole subject in the preceding verses <a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">4-6</a> is the salvation of people who worshiped the Lord and lived in accordance with His commandments, and this period of time is what is meant by the thousand years.<p>We are in fact not told that the people were raised from the lower earth, but it is nevertheless apparent from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_6_1.htm">6</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_6_9.htm">6:9-11</a>, where they were seen under the altar, and under the altar means in a lower earth. That is why they are also called here in verse <a href="3927/revelation_20_6.htm">6</a> priests of God and of Christ (see no. <a href="854.htm">854</a> above).<p>That the New Christian Heaven was increased by their number is also something we are not told here, yet it is nevertheless apparent from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">Revelation 14</a> where the subject is the New Christian Heaven, as may be seen from the explanations there, especially in nos. <a href="612.htm">612</a>, <a href="613.htm">613</a>, <a href="626.htm">626</a>, <a href="631.htm">631</a>, <a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="659.htm">659</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>.<p>Satan's being set loose from his prison means, symbolically, that those people were let go who had confirmed themselves in faith alone as regards their doctrine, because the dragon here is called Satan, and not at the same time the Devil, as in verse <a href="3927/revelation_20_2.htm">2</a> above; and as the Devil, the dragon means people who were caught up in evils in the way they lived, and as Satan, people caught up in falsities as regards their faith, as may be seen in no. <a href="841.htm">841</a> above. But the character of the one and the other will be seen in the following number. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;A reference probably to the missing no. 857. [See number <a href="858.htm">858</a>.] </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 856</h4><p>856. [verse 7] 'And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be let loose out of his prison' signifies that after those who had till then been hidden and guarded in the lower land were taken up by the Lord into heaven and by means of them the Christian New Heaven was increased, all those who have confirmed untruths of faith with themselves should be let out. 'When the thousand years are finished' signifies after those who had till then been hidden and guarded in the lower land were taken up by the Lord into heaven. The reason this is signified by 'when the thousand years are finished' is because in the preceding verses (<a href="4.htm">4-6</a>) it treats only of the salvation of those who worshipped the Lord and lived in accordance with His precepts, and this space of time is understood by 'the thousand years.' It is not indeed said that they are those who were taken up out of the lower land, but yet it is plain from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_6_9.htm">6:9-10</a> where they were seen 'under the altar,' and 'under the altar' is in the lower land; and therefore also here they are called 'priests of God and Christ' (verse 6) as may be seen above (<a href="854.htm">854</a>). Neither is it said here that by means of them the Christian New Heaven was increased, although, however, this is plain from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">14</a> where it treats of the Christian New Heaven, as can be seen from the things expounded there (especially <a href="612.htm">612-613</a>, <a href="626.htm">626</a>, <a href="631.htm">631</a>, <a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="659.htm">659</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>). The reason that by 'Satan shall be let loose out of his prison' is signified that those who have confirmed themselves doctrinally in faith alone should be let out, is because the dragon is here called 'Satan' and not at the same time 'the Devil' as above (verse 2), and by 'the dragon' as 'Satan' are understood those who are in untruths of faith, as may be seen above (<a href="841.htm">841</a>); but what the one is like and what the other will be seen in the following paragraph. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 856</h4><p>856. Verse 7. And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, signifies that after they who had before been concealed and guarded in the lower earth, were taken up by the Lord into heaven, and the New Christian Heaven increased by them, all who had confirmed themselves in the falsities of faith were let loose. "When the thousand years are finished," signifies after they were taken up by the Lord into heaven who had hitherto been concealed and guarded in the lower earth. The reason why "when the thousand years are finished" has this signification, is because the salvation of those who worshiped the Lord, and who lived according to His commandments, is alone treated of in verses <a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">4-6</a>, which precede, and this interval of time is meant by "a thousand years." It is not said, indeed, that they were taken up from the lower earth, but yet it is evident from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_6_9.htm">6:9-11</a>, where they were seen "under the altar," and "under the altar" means in the lower earth; wherefore also they are here called "priests of God and of Christ" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_20_6.htm">6</a>, see above <a href="854.htm">854</a>). Neither is it here said that the New Christian Heaven was increased by them, though this appears evidently from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">14</a>, which treats of the New Christian Heaven, as may be seen from the explanations there given (especially in <a href="612.htm">612</a>, <a href="613.htm">613</a>, <a href="626.htm">626</a>, <a href="631.htm">631</a>, <a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="659.htm">659</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>). The reason why by "Satan was loosed out of his prison," is signified that they who had confirmed themselves in faith alone, as to doctrine, were to be let loose, is because "the dragon" is here called "Satan" and not at the same time "Devil," as above (verse <a href="3927/revelation_20_2.htm">2</a>); and by "the dragon" as "the Devil" are meant those who were in evils of life, and by "the dragon" as "Satan" are meant those who were in the falsities of faith (see above <a href="841.htm">841</a>); but the quality of the one and of the other will be seen in the next article. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 856 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>856.(ac 857). (Vers. 7.) "Et quando consummati sunt mille anni, solvetur Satanas e carcere Suo," significat quod postquam a Domino in Caelum sublati sunt qui in inferiore terra hactenus reconditi et custoditi fuerunt, et per illos Novum Caelum Christianum adauctum est, omnes illi qui falsa fidei apud se confirmaverunt, emitterentur. -"Quando consummati sunt mille anni significat postquam a Domino in Caelum sublati sunt qui hactenus in inferiore terra reconditi et custoditi fuerunt; quod hoc per "quando consummati sunt mille anni" significetur, est quia de salvatione illorum qui coluerunt Dominum et qui vixerunt secundum praecepta Ipsius, in versibus 4-6, qui praecedunt, solum agitur, et hoc spatium temporis intelligitur per "mille annos." Quod sint qui sublati sunt ex inferiore terra, quidem non dicitur, sed usque patet ex capite <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_856/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_6_9-11" target=_top>6:9-11</a>, ubi visi sunt "sub Altari," et "sub Altari" est in inferiore terra; quare etiam hic vocantur "sacerdotes Dei et Christi," (vers. 6; videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_856/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_854" target=_top>854</a>). <sup>1</sup>Quod per illos Novum Caelum Christianum adauctum sit, hic nec dicitur; usque tamen hoc patet ex <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_856/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_14_1-20" target=_top>14</a>, ubi de Novo Caelo Christiano agitur, ut videri potest ab explicatis ibi (imprimis <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_856/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_612" target=_top>612</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_856/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_613" target=_top>613</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_856/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_626" target=_top>626</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_856/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_631" target=_top>631</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_856/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_647" target=_top>647</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_856/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_659" target=_top>659</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_856/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_661" target=_top>661</a>). Quod per "solvetur Satanas e carcere suo" significetur quod qui in sola Fide quoad doctrinam se confirmaverunt, emitterentur, est quia "Draco" hic vocatur "Satanas," et non simul "Diabolus," ut supra (vers. 2); et per "Draconem" ut "Diabolum" intelliguntur qui in malis vitae fuerunt, et per "Draconem" ut "Satanam" intelliguntur qui in falsis fidei (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_856/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_841" target=_top>841</a>); at qualis unus et qualis alter in sequenti articulo videbitur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;854 pro "846" </p>
