<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第510节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>510.启11:11.“过了这三天半，有生命的灵气从神那里进入他们里面，他们就立足站了起来”表在前教会结束，新教会开始和发展之时，新教会的这两大基本要素在那些接受它们的人里面被主复活。“三天半”表示直到结束和开始（<a href="505.htm">505</a>节），因而表示自现教会结束到新教会开始，在此表示新教会在这些人（接受新教会两大基本要素的人）当中的开始和发展，因为现在说的是“两个见证人”，“有生命的灵气从神那里进入他们里面，他们就立足站了起来”。“神那里的有生命的灵气”表示属灵的生命；“立足站了起来”表示与属灵生命一致的属世生命，因而表示靠主复活。之所以表示这一点，是因为“生命的灵气”表示人的内在，也就是所谓的“内在人”，就其本身而言，内在人是属灵的，因为是人的灵在思维和意愿，而思维和意愿本身是属灵的。“立足站了起来”表示人的外在，就是所谓的“外在人”，就其本身而言，外在人是属世的；因为身体言说并行出它的灵所思维和意愿的，说与行是属世的；“脚”表示属世事物（参看<a href="49.htm">49</a>，<a href="468.htm">468</a>节）。</p><p>这句话的具体含义是这样解释的：每个被改造的人，首先是内在人被改造，然后是外在人被改造。内在人的改造不仅通过知道和理解人藉以得救的真理和良善，还通过意愿和热爱它们；而外在人的改造则通过言说并行出内在人所意愿和热爱的事，并且这一切进行到什么程度，人就被重生到什么程度。</p><p>之前他之所以未重生，是因为之前他的内在不在结果中，只在原因中；原因若不在结果中，就会消散。这就像建在冰上的房子，冰被太阳融化后，这房子便沉到水底；简言之，这就像人没有脚却要站立和行走。内在人或属灵人若不以外在人或属世人为基础，也是如此。这就是“灵气从神那里进入两个见证人里面，他们就立足站了起来”，以及以西结书中类似表述的含义：</p><p>耶和华对我说，你要向风发预言，于是我说预言，灵就进入他们，他们就立足站起来。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.9.htm">37:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>同一先知书：</p><p>一个说话的声音对我说，人子啊，立足站起来；灵就进入我里面，使我立足站起来。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结2.1.htm">2:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结2.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p></p><p>我就伏面，灵就进入我里面，使我立足站起来。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.23.htm">3:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.24.htm">24</a>）</p><p>这也是主对彼得说这番话的意思：</p><p>彼得说，不但洗我的脚，连手和头也要洗。耶稣对他说，凡洗过澡的人，只要把脚一洗，全身就干净了。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.9.htm">13:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.10.htm">10</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 510</h4><p>510. But after the three and a half days the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet. (<a href="3927/revelation_11_11.htm">11:11</a>) This symbolically means that at the end of the prior church, as the New Church commences and grows, these two essential elements of the New Church are made living by the Lord in people who accept them.<p>Three and a half days means, symbolically, at the end and then the beginning (no. <a href="505.htm">505</a>), thus at the end of the church still existing and the beginning of a new one, here the beginning of the church in people in whom the New Church commences and grows, because we are told now in regard to the two witnesses that the breath of life entered them and they stood on their feet.<p>The breath of life from God symbolizes spiritual life, and standing on their feet symbolizes natural life in harmony with spiritual life, and thus one made living by the Lord. This is the symbolic meaning because the breath of life refers to a person's inner being, called his inner self, which regarded in itself is spiritual. For it is a person's spirit that thinks and wills, and to think and will is, in itself, a spiritual activity. <sup>1</sup>Standing on the feet symbolizes a person's outer being, called his outer self, which in itself is natural. For it is the body that says and does what the spirit in it thinks and wills, and to speak and act is a natural activity. That the feet symbolize natural things may be seen in nos. <a href="49.htm">49</a>, <a href="468.htm">468</a>.</p><p>[2] We need to say what all this means specifically. Everyone who is reformed is reformed first in respect to his inner self, and afterward in respect to his outer self. The inner self is reformed, not by simply knowing and understanding the truths and goods by which a person is saved, but by willing and loving them, and the outer self by saying and doing what the inner self wills and loves. To the extent the outer self does this, then, to the same extent the person is regenerated. He is not regenerated prior to that because before then his inner self is not present in the effect, but subsists only in the cause, and unless a cause has an effect, it dissipates. It is like a house founded on a field of ice, a house that sinks to the bottom when the sun melts the ice. In short, it is like a person without feet on which to stand and walk. The same is the case with the inner or spiritual self unless it is founded on the outer or natural self.<p>This, now, is what is symbolically meant by the two witnesses' standing on their feet after breath from God entered them, and also by similar statements in Ezekiel:<p>(Jehovah) said to me, "Prophesy regarding the breath...." And (when) I prophesied... breath came into them, and they... stood upon their feet... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_9.htm">Ezekiel 37:9-10</a>)<p>Also in Ezekiel:<p>(The voice speaking to me said,) "Son of man, stand on your feet...." Then the spirit <sup>1</sup>entered me... and set me on my feet. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_2_1.htm">Ezekiel 2:1-2</a>)<p>And again in Ezekiel:<p>...I fell on my face. But the spirit <sup>1</sup>...entered me and set me on my feet... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_3_23.htm">Ezekiel 3:23-24</a>)<p>This, too, is the meaning of the Lord's words to Peter:<p>...Peter said..., ."..(wash) not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!" Jesus said to him, "He who is bathed needs only to have his feet washed, and he is completely clean." (<a href="3927/john_13_9.htm">John 13:9-10</a>)<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the original Latin, the word for breath and spirit is the same, and it is translated here as both breath and spirit. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 510</h4><p>510. [verse 11] 'And after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet' signifies that these two Essentials of the New Church, at the end of the former [Church] while the New Church is beginning and progressing, will be made living with those who receive. By 'three days and a half' is signified to the end and the beginning (<a href="505.htm">505</a>), thus from the end of the Church that exists at present to the beginning of the New, this [being with those] among whom the New Church is beginning and progressing, because it is said now of the witnesses that 'the spirit of life entered into them and they stood upon their feet.' By 'the spirit of life from God' is signified spiritual life, and by 'to stand upon their feet' is signified a natural life agreeing with spiritual life, and thus made living by the Lord. This is signified because by 'the spirit of life' is understood a man's internal, which is called the internal man, and this regarded in itself is spiritual, for the spirit of the man thinks and wills, and to think and will in itself is spiritual. By 'to stand upon the feet' is signified the man's external, which is called the external man, and this in itself is natural, for the body speaks and does what its spirit thinks and wills, and to speak and do is natural. That 'the feet' signify natural things may be seen (<a href="49.htm">49</a>, <a href="468.htm">468</a>).</p><p>[2] What specifically is understood by this shall be stated. Every man who is being reformed is reformed first as to the internal man, and afterwards as to the external. The internal man is not reformed by simply knowing and understanding the truths and goods by means of which the man is saved, but by willing and loving them; but the external man [is reformed] by speaking and doing the things that the internal man wills and loves, and in so far as he is doing this, so far the man is being regenerated. He is not being regenerated before, because his internal is not in the effect before but only in the cause, and the cause, if it is not in the effect, is dissipated. It is like a house founded upon ice, which sinks to the bottom when the ice is melted by the sun; in a word, it is like a man without feet upon which he may stand and walk. The case is similar with the internal or spiritual man if it is not founded in the external or natural. This then is what is signified by the fact that the two witnesses 'stood upon their feet' after 'the spirit from God entered into them'; and what is signified also by the similar things in Ezekiel:<p>Jehovah said unto me, Prophesy upon the spirit, and when I prophesied, the spirit entered into them and they stood upon the feet. <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_9.htm">Ezekiel 37:9-12</a>.<p>In the same:<p>The voice speaking unto me said, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, then the spirit entered into me and stood me upon my feet. <a href="3927/ezekiel_2_1.htm">Ezekiel 2:1-2</a>; and in the same:<p>I fell upon my faces, but the spirit came into me, and set me upon my feet. <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_23.htm">Ezekiel 3:23-24</a>.<p>This also is what is understood by the Lord's words to Peter:<p>Peter said, Thou mayest wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head; Jesus said to him, He who is washed has need only to be washed as to the feet, and the whole is clean. <a href="3927/john_13_9.htm">John 13:9</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 510</h4><p>510. Verse 11. And after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet, signifies that these two essentials of the New Church, at the end of the former, when the New Church is beginning and progressing, are vivified by the Lord with those who receive them. By "three days and a half" is signified to the end and the beginning, (<a href="505.htm">505</a>), thus from the end of the present church to the beginning of the New, in this case, with those among whom the New Church begins and progresses, because it is now said of "the witnesses," that "the spirit of life entered into them, and they stood upon their feet." By "the spirit of life from God" is signified spiritual life; and by "standing upon their feet" is signified natural life agreeing with spiritual life, and thus vivification from the Lord. The reason why this is signified, is, because by "the spirit of life" is meant the internal of man, which is called the internal man, which, considered in itself, is spiritual, for the spirit of man thinks and wills, and to think and will in itself is spiritual. By "standing upon their feet" is signified the external of man, which is called the external man, which is in itself natural; for the body speaks and acts what its spirit thinks and wills, and to speak and to act is natural; that feet signify things natural, may be seen, (<a href="49.htm">49</a>, <a href="468.htm">468</a>).</p><p>[2] What is specifically meant by this expression, shall be explained: Every man who is reformed, is first reformed as to the internal man, and afterwards as to the external. The internal man is not reformed by merely knowing and understanding the truths and goods by which man is saved, but by willing and loving them; but the external man, by speaking and doing the things which the internal man wills and loves, and, in proportion as this takes place, in the same proportion man is regenerated. The reason why he is not regenerated before, is, because his internal is not before in the effect, but only in the cause, and, unless the cause be in the effect, it is dissipated. It is like a house built upon ice, which sinks to the bottom when the ice is melted by the sun; in a word, it is like a man without feet to stand and walk upon. It is the same with the internal or spiritual man, if it is not founded on the external or natural man. Such then is the signification of "the two witnesses standing upon their feet after the spirit from God entered into them;" and also of similar expressions in Ezekiel:<p>Jehovah said unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, and when I prophesied, the spirit entered into them, and they stood upon their feet, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_9.htm">Ezekiel 37:9-10</a>).<p>In the same:<p>A voice speaking unto me, said, Son of man, stand upon thy feet; and the spirit entered into me and stood me upon my feet, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_2_1.htm">Ezekiel 2:1-2</a>).<p>And in the same:<p>I fell on my face, then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_3_23.htm">Ezekiel 3:23-24</a>).<p>This is what is meant also by the Lord's words to Peter:<p>Peter said, Thou shalt not wash my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus said to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, and the whole is clean, (<a href="3927/john_13_9.htm">John 13:9-10</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 510 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>510. (Vers. 11.) Et post tres dies et dimidium spiritus vitae a Deo intravit in illos, et steterunt super pedibus suis," significat quod duo illa Essentialia Novae Ecclesiae in fine prioris dum Nova Ecclesia inchoat et progreditur, a Domino vivificentur apud illos qui recipiunt. - Per "dies tres et dimidium" significatur ad finem et principium (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_510/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_505" target=_top>505</a>), ita a fine Ecclesiae quae adhuc est, ad principium novae; hic apud quos Nova Ecclesia inchoat et progreditur, quia dicitur nunc de "testibus," quod "spiritus vitae intraverit in illos, et steterint super pedibus;" per "spiritum vitae a Deo" significatur vita spiritualis, et per "stare super pedibus "significatur vita naturalis cum vita spirituali concordans, ac ita a Domino vivificari. Quod hoc significetur est quia per "spiritum vitae" intelligitur internum hominis, quod vocatur internus homo, qui in se spectatus est spiritualis, spiritus enim hominis cogitat et vult, ac cogitare et velle in se est spirituale; per "stare super pedibus" significatur externum hominis quod etiam vocatur externus homo, qui in se est naturalis, corpus enim loquitur et facit quod spiritus ejus cogitat et vult, ac loqui et facere est naturale; quod "pedes" significent naturalia videatur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_510/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_49" target=_top>49</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_510/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_468" target=_top>468</a>).<p>Quid in specie per hoc intelligitur, dicetur: - Omnis homo qui reformatur, primum reformatur quoad internum hominem, et postea quoad externum. Internus homo non reformatur per solum scire et intelligere vera et bona per quae homo salvatur, sed per velle et amare illa; externus autem homo per loqui et facere illa quae internus homo vult et amat; et quantum hoc fit, tantum homo regeneratur. Quod non prius regeneretur, est quia internum ejus non prius est in effectu, sed solum in causa; et causa, nisi sit in effectu, dissipatur; est sicut domus fundata super glacie, quae cadit in fundum cum glacies a sole liquescit; verbo, est sicut homo absque pedibus super quibus stet et ambulet: simile est cum interno seu spirituali homine nisi fundetur in externo seu naturali. Hoc nunc est quod significatur per quod "bini testes steterint super pedibus postquam spiritus a Deo intraverit in illos;" et quoque per similia apud Ezechielem: <p>Jehovah "dixit ad me, Propheta super spiritu; et cum prophetavi, intravit in illos spiritus, et steterunt super pedibus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_510/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_37_9-10" target=_top>37:9-10</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>apud eundem, <p>Vox loquens ad me dixit, "Fili hominis, sta super pedibus tuis, tunc intravit in me spiritus et statuit me super pedes," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_510/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_2_1-2" target=_top>2:1-2</a>);<p>et apud eundem, <p>"Cecidi super facies meas; sed venit in me spiritus, et erexit me super pedes meos," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_510/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_3_23-24" target=_top>3:23-24</a>).<p>Hoc etiam est quod intelligitur per Domini verba ad Petrum: <p>"Dixit Petrus, non laves pedes meos tantum, sed et manus et caput; dixit illi Jesus, qui lotus est, non opus habet nisi quoad pedes lavetur, et mundus est totus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_510/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_13_9" target=_top>Johannes 13:9</a>(, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_510/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_13_10" target=_top>10</a>)).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;10 pro "12" </p>
