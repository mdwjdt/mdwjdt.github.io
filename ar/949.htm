<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第949节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>949.启22:12.“看哪，我必快来！赏赐在我，要照各人所行的报应他”表主必定到来，对信祂，并照其诫命生活的每个人来说，祂自己就是天堂和永生的幸福。“看哪，我必快来”表示祂必定到来，也就是要施行审判，建一个新天和一个新地。“快”表示必定（参看<a href="4.htm">4</a>，<a href="943.htm">943</a>，<a href="944.htm">944</a>，<a href="947.htm">947</a>节）。“赏赐在我”表示主自己就是天堂和永生的幸福。“赏赐”是指天堂和永生的幸福（参看<a href="526.htm">526</a>节）。下文会看到，它就是主自己。“要照各人所行的报应他”表示照着他凭对主之信和照其诫命的生活而与主的结合。之所以表示这一点，是因为“好行为”表示内在中的仁与信，以及同时它们在外在的果效；由于仁与信来自主，取决于与主的结合，故显而易见所表示的是这些；因而这一切也就和前文连贯起来了。好行为就是内在的仁与信，以及同时它们在外在的果效（参看<a href="641.htm">641</a>，<a href="868.htm">868</a>，<a href="871.htm">871</a>节）。</p><p>众所周知，仁与信并非来自人，而是来自主；它们因来自主，故取决于与主的结合，而与主的结合通过对主之信和照其诫命的生活实现。信主意味着对祂会施行拯救的信心，那些直接靠近主，并避恶如罪的人就具有这种信心；而其他人则没有。之所以说“赏赐在我”表示主自己就是天堂和永生的幸福，是因为“赏赐”是内在的幸福或八福，也就是所谓的“平安”，因而是永恒的外在喜乐。这些唯独来自主，凡从主来的，不仅来自祂，而且就是祂自己，因为若非是祂自己，主就无法从自己发出任何事物；事实上，祂照着结合而全在于每个人里面，而结合取决于接受，接受取决于爱与智慧，或若你愿意，取决于仁与信，仁与信又取决于生活，生活则取决于对邪恶与虚假的憎恶，对邪恶与虚假的憎恶取决于对邪恶与虚假的认知，然后取决于悔改，同时取决于对主的依靠。</p><p>“赏赐”不仅来自主，而且就是主自己。这一点从圣言中那些论及与主结合的人在主里面，主也在他们里面的经文明显看出来（如约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">14:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.24.htm">24</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.4.htm">15:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.5.htm">5</a> 等；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.19.htm">17:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.21.htm">21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">14:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.24.htm">24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.4.htm">15:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.19.htm">17:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.26.htm">26</a>等），还可从前文（<a href="883.htm">883</a>节），以及论到圣灵在他们里面；圣灵就是主，因为圣灵是祂的神性临在；还有，我们祈求神住在人里面，教导、引领他们，赐他们传道的口才、行善的身体等此类性质的事明显看出来。</p><p>事实上，主就是爱本身和智慧本身；这二者并非在某个地方，而是在它们被接受之处，并取决于接受的性质。不过，除了那些通过接受由主那里从天堂而来的光而处于智慧的人外，这个奥秘无法被理解；《圣治》和《圣爱与圣智》这两本书所写的内容，就是为了这些人的益处；其中已说明，主自己照着接受而在人里面，神性之物丝毫不会与祂分离。天使处于神性全在的观念时，便处于这种观念，我毫不怀疑有些基督徒也处于类似观念。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 949</h4><p>949. <a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">22:12</a> "And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to every one according to his work." This symbolically means that the Lord will surely come, and His presence is heaven and the felicity of eternal life for everyone in accordance with his faith in the Lord and his life in obedience to the Lord's commandments.<p>"Behold, I am coming quickly" symbolically means that the Lord will surely come, namely, to execute judgment and to establish a new heaven and a new church. That immediacy in time means certainty may be seen in nos. <a href="4.htm">4</a>, <a href="943.htm">943</a>, <a href="944.htm">944</a>, <a href="947.htm">947</a>. "My reward is with Me" symbolically means that the Lord's very presence is heaven and the felicity of eternal life. That the reward is heaven and eternal happiness may be seen in no. <a href="526.htm">526</a>. That it is the Lord's very presence will be seen below.<p>To give to everyone according to his work means, symbolically, to do so in accordance with a person's conjunction with the Lord through faith in the Lord and living in obedience to His commandments. This is the symbolic meaning because good works symbolize charity and faith internally, and at the same time the effects of these outwardly. And because charity and faith come from the Lord, and are received in accordance with a person's conjunction with Him, it is apparent that these are what are symbolically meant. The meaning here thus coheres as well with what has been said before.<p>That good works are charity and faith inwardly and at the same time the effects of these outwardly may be seen in nos. <a href="641.htm">641</a>, <a href="868.htm">868</a>, <a href="871.htm">871</a> above.</p><p>[2] People know that charity and faith come not from man, but from the Lord. And because they come from the Lord, they are received in accordance with a person's conjunction with Him, and a conjunction with Him is formed through faith in Him and living in accordance with His commandments. Faith in Him means a confidence that He will save, and this confidence is found in people who turn to Him directly and refrain from evils as being sins. Such a faith is not possible in others.<p>We said that "My reward is with Me" symbolically means that the Lord's very presence is heaven and the felicity of eternal life, for the reward is an inward bliss, called peace, and a consequent outer joy. This is possible only from the Lord, and whatever comes from the Lord not only emanates from Him, but also constitutes His very presence. For the Lord cannot emit anything from Himself without His being present in it. Indeed, He is omnipresent in everyone in accordance with some conjunction, and the conjunction depends on reception, and the reception on love and wisdom, or if you please, on charity and faith, and charity and faith on the person's way of life, and the person's way of life on an aversion to evil and falsity, and an aversion to evil and falsity on knowing what evil and falsity are, and on repenting then and at the same time looking to the Lord.</p><p>[3] That the reward not only comes from the Lord but also constitutes His very presence is apparent from passages in the Word where we are told that those people who are conjoined with Him are in Him and have Him in them, as may be seen in <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-24</a>, <sup>1</sup><a href="3927/revelation_15_4.htm">15:4</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_15_5.htm">15:5</a>ff., <sup>2</sup><a href="3927/john_17_19.htm">17:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">17:21-22</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">17:26</a>, <sup>3</sup>and elsewhere (see no. <a href="883.htm">883</a> above). And also where we are told that the Holy Spirit is in them <sup>4</sup>- the Holy Spirit being the Lord, for it is His Divine presence. So, too, when we pray that God may dwell in people, teaching them, leading them, giving them a tongue to preach and a body to do what is good, and other like things as well.<p>The Lord, indeed, is love itself and wisdom itself. These two do not exist in some location, but are present wherever they are received, in accordance with the character of the reception.<p>But this arcanum can be understood only by people who are wise owing to their receiving the light of heaven from the Lord. It is for them what we wrote in two works, one being Divine Providence and the other Divine Love and Wisdom, where we showed that the Lord Himself is present in people in accordance with their reception, and not some Divine quality apart from Him. This is the concept that angels have when they conceive of the Divine omnipresence, and I do not doubt that some Christians have a similar concept.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"At that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you. He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him." Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, "Lord, how is it that You will manifest Yourself to us, and not to the world?" Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father's who sent Me."<br><br>2.&nbsp;"Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing."<br><br>3.&nbsp;"And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified by the truth..., that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me. And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one... And I have declared to them Your name, and will declare it, that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them."<br><br>4.&nbsp;E.g., <a href="3927/john_20_22.htm">John 20:22</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 949</h4><p>949. [verse 12] 'And behold I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, rendering to everyone according as his work shall be' signifies that the Lord is certainly going to come, and that He Himself is heaven and the happiness of eternal life, to each one in accordance with faith in Him and a life in accordance with His precepts. 'I am coming quickly' signifies that He is certainly going to come, that is, to effect the judgment and to establish a New Heaven and a New Church. That 'quickly' means certainly may be seen (<a href="4.htm">4</a>, <a href="943.htm">943-944</a>, <a href="947.htm">947</a>). 'My reward is with Me' signifies that the Lord Himself is heaven and the happiness of eternal life. That the 'reward' is heaven and eternal happiness may be seen (<a href="526.htm">526</a>). That it is the Lord Himself will be seen below. 'Rendering to everyone according to his work' signifies in accordance with conjunction with the Lord by means of faith in Him and by means of a life in accordance with His precepts. The reason why these things are signified is because by 'good works' are signified charity and faith in internal things and at the same time the effect of them in external things. And because charity and faith are from the Lord and in accordance with conjunction with Him it is plain that they are signified. Thus also these things cohere with the former statements. That good works are charity and faith in internal things and at the same time the effect of them in external things may be seen above (<a href="641.htm">641</a>, <a href="868.htm">868</a>, <a href="871.htm">871</a>).</p><p>[2] That charity and faith are not from man but from the Lord is known; and because they are from the Lord they are in accordance with conjunction with Him, and conjunction with Him is effected by means of faith in Him and by a life in accordance with His precepts. By faith in Him is understood confidence that He will save, and they have this confidence who approach Him directly and flee from evils as sins; with others it cannot be given. It was said that 'My reward is with Me' signifies that He Himself is heaven and the happiness of eternal life, for the 'reward' is the inward blessedness that is called peace, and external joy exists from this. These are solely from the Lord, and the things that are from the Lord are not only from Himself but also are Himself, for the Lord cannot send forth anything from Himself unless it is Himself; for He is omnipresent with each individual man in accordance with conjunction, and conjunction is in accordance with reception, and reception is in accordance with love and wisdom, or if you will, in accordance with charity and faith, and charity and faith is in accordance with the life, and the life is in accordance with turning away from evil and untruth, while turning away from evil and untruth is in accordance with the cognition of what is evil and untruth, and then in accordance with repentance and at the same time looking to the Lord.</p><p>[3] That the 'reward' is not only from the Lord but also is the Lord Himself is plain from the places in the Word where it is said that those who are conjoined with Him are in Himself and Himself in them, as can be established in <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-24</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">15:4-5</a> seq.; <a href="3927/john_17_19.htm">17:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">21-22</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a>), and elsewhere, as may be seen above (<a href="883.htm">883</a>); and also where it is said that the Holy Spirit is in them; and the Holy Spirit is the Lord for it is His Divine presence; and also when prayer is made that God may dwell in them, teach them, lead them, the tongue to preach and the body to do what is good, besides other similar things. For the Lord is Love Itself and Wisdom Itself. These two are not in a place, but are where they are being received and in accordance with the quality of the reception. But this arcanum cannot be understood except by those who are in wisdom derived from the reception of light out of heaven from the Lord. For the benefit of these are the things that have been written in two works, the one concerning DIVINE PROVIDENCE and the other concerning DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM, in which it has been demonstrated that the Lord Himself is in men in accordance with the reception, and not anything Divine separated from Him. The angels are in this idea when they are in the idea of Divine Omnipresence, and I have no doubt that some Christians also can be in a similar idea. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 949</h4><p>949. Verse 12. And, behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to render to everyone according as his work shall be, signifies that the Lord will certainly come, and that He Himself is heaven and the felicity of eternal life to everyone according to faith in Him, and life according to His commandments. "Behold, I come quickly," signifies that He will certainly come, that is, to execute judgment, and to found a New Heaven and a New Church. That "quickly" means certainly, may be seen, (<a href="4.htm">4</a>, <a href="943.htm">943</a>, <a href="944.htm">944</a>, <a href="947.htm">947</a>). "My reward is with Me," signifies that the Lord Himself is heaven and the felicity of eternal life. That "reward" is heaven and eternal felicity, may be seen, (<a href="526.htm">526</a>). That it is the Lord Himself, will be seen below. "Rendering unto everyone according to His work," signifies according to his conjunction with the Lord by faith in Him and by life according to His commandments. The reason why this is signified, is because by good works are signified charity and faith in internals, and, at the same time, their effects in externals; and because charity and faith are from the Lord, and according to conjunction with Him, it is evident that these are signified; thus also this coheres with what went before. That good works are charity and faith in internals, and at the same time their effects in externals, may be seen above, (<a href="641.htm">641</a>, <a href="868.htm">868</a>, <a href="871.htm">871</a>).</p><p>[2] That charity and faith are not from man, but from the Lord, is known; and because they are from the Lord they are according to conjunction with Him, and conjunction with Him is effected by faith in him and by a life according to His commandments. By faith in Him is meant confidence that He will save, and they have this confidence who immediately approach Him, and shun evils as sins; with others it is not given. It was said that "My reward is with Me" signifies that He Himself is heaven and the felicity of eternal life, for "reward" is intrinsic beatitude, which is called peace, and thence external joy. These are solely from the Lord, and the things which are from the Lord, not only are from Him, but also are Himself, for the Lord cannot send forth anything from Himself except it be Himself, for he is omnipresent with every man according to conjunction, and conjunction is according to reception, and reception is according to love and wisdom, or if you will, according to charity and faith, and charity and faith are according to life, and life is according to the aversion to evil and falsity, and aversion to evil and falsity is according to the knowledge of what is evil and false, and then according to repentance, and at the same time looking to the Lord.</p><p>[3] That "reward" not only is from the Lord but also is the Lord Himself appears from those passages in the Word where it is said that they who are conjoined with Him are in Him and He in them, as may be seen in <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20-24</a>; <a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">15:4-5</a> seq.; <a href="3927/john_17_19.htm">17:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">21-22</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_26.htm">26</a> and in other places), see above, (<a href="883.htm">883</a>) and also where it is said that the Holy Spirit is in them; and the Holy Spirit is the Lord, for it is His Divine presence; and also when he prays that God will dwell in them to teach and lead them, the tongue to preach and the body to do that which is good; besides other things of a like nature. For the Lord is love itself and wisdom itself; these two are not in place but are where they are received and according to the quality of the reception. But this arcanum cannot be understood except by those who are in wisdom from the reception of light from heaven from the Lord; for the use of these are the things which are written in the two works Divine Providence and Divine Love and Wisdom, in which it is shown that the Lord Himself is in men according to reception and not from anything Divine separated from Him. The angels are in this idea when they are in the idea of Divine omnipresence, and I do not doubt that that some Christians are in a similar idea also. </p>

Quod charitas et fides non sint ab homine, sed a Domino, notum est; et quia a Domino, sunt secundum conjunctionem cum Ipso, et conjunctio cum Ipso fit per fidem in Ipsum et per vitam secundum praecepta Ipsius; per fidem in Ipsum intelligitur fiducia quod Ipse salvet, et haec fiducia est illis qui Ipsum immediate adeunt, et fugiunt mala ut peccata; apud alios non dabilis est. Dictum est quod "merces Mea cum Me" significet quod Ipse sit Caelum et felicitas vitae aeternae, "merces" enim est beatitudo intrinseca, quae vocatur pax, et inde gaudium externum; haec unice sunt a Domino, et quae a Domino sunt non modo sunt ab Ipso, sed etiam sunt Ipse, nam Dominus non potest aliquid a Se emittere, nisi Ipse sit: est enim Omnipraesens apud unumquemvis hominem secundum conjunctionem; et conjunctio (est) secundum receptionem, et receptio secundum amorem et sapientiam; aut si velitis secundum charitatem et fidem, et charitas et fides secundum vitam, et vita secundum aversationem mali et falsi, ac aversatio mali et falsi secundum cognitionem quid malum et falsum, et tunc secundum paenitentiam et simul intuitionem ad Dominum. Quod "merces" non modo sit a Domino, sed etiam Ipse Dominus, patet a locis in Verbo, ubi dicitur quod qui conjuncti sunt Ipsi sint in Ipso et Ipse in illis (Ut constare potest apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_949/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_20-24" target=_top>Johannem 14:20-24</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_949/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_4-5" target=_top>15:4-5</a>, seq.; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_949/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_17_19" target=_top>17:19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_949/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_17_21-22" target=_top>21-22</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_949/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_17_26" target=_top>26</a>; et alibi), (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_949/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_883" target=_top>883</a>); et quoque ubi dicitur quod Spiritus Sanctus sit in illis, et Spiritus Sanctus est Dominus, est enim Divina Ipsius Praesentia; et quoque cum oratur ut Deus habitet in illis, doceat illos, ducat illos, linguam ad praedicandum, et corpus ad faciendum quod bonum est, praeter similia alia: est enim Dominus Ipse Amor et Ipsa Sapientia; haec duo non sunt in loco, sed sunt ubi recipiuntur, et secundum quale receptionis: ast hoc arcanum non potest intelligi, nisi ab illis qui in sapientia sunt ex receptione lucis e Caelo a Domino; pro his sunt quae scripta sunt in binis Operibus, uno de Divina Providentia, altero de Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia, in quibus demonstratum est, quod Ipse Dominus sit in hominibus secundum receptionem, et non aliquod Divinum separatum ab Ipso. Angeli in hac idea sunt, dum in idea de Omnipraesentia Divina, et non dubito quin etiam aliqui Christiani in simili possint esse. </p>
