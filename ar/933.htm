<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第933节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>933.启22:2.“流在城的街道中央，在河这边与那边有生命树，结十二回果子”表那在新教会的教义、因而生活的真理至内层的，是在其神性之爱中的主，人表面上貌似凭自己所行的一切良善皆从祂流出。“在中央”表示在至内层或核心处，因而在周围的一切事物中（<a href="44.htm">44</a>，<a href="383.htm">383</a>节）。“街道”表示教会的教义真理（<a href="501.htm">501</a>，<a href="917.htm">917</a>节）。“河”表示丰富的神性真理（<a href="409.htm">409</a>，<a href="932.htm">932</a>节）。“这边和那边”表示在右和在左；在右的真理就是在清晰中的，在左的真理则是在模糊中的；因为在天上，南边表示清晰的真理，在右；北边表示模糊的真理，在左（<a href="901.htm">901</a>节）。“生命树”表示主的神性之爱（<a href="89.htm">89</a>节）。“果子”表示爱与仁之良善，也就是所谓的“好行为”或“善行”，对此，下一节会论述。“十二”表示全部，论及教会的良善与真理（<a href="348.htm">348</a>节）。将这些内容合成一个意思，可推知：“流在城的街道中央，在河这边与那边有生命树，结十二回果子”表示那在新教会的教义、因而生活的真理至内层的，是在其神性之爱中的主，人表面上貌似凭自己所行的一切良善皆从祂流出。</p><p>这一切就发生在那些直接转向主，并避开邪恶因它们是罪的人，因而在那些将要在主的新教会，就是新耶路撒冷的人身上。而那些不直接转向主的人则无法与祂结合，因而也无法与父结合，进而无法处于来自神性的爱；事实上，注视祂才产生结合，当然不是纯理性地注视，而是出于意愿情感的理性注视；除非人守祂的诫命，否则，意愿的情感不会被赐下；因此，主说：</p><p>遵守我命令的，这人就是爱我的；我要到他那里去，与他同住。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.21.htm">14:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.24.htm">24</a>）</p><p>之所以说在教义、因而生活的真理至内层或核心处，是因为在属灵的事上，一切通过至内层或核心存在，并从至内层或核心发出，正如核心处的火与光向周边散发；或如同热与光从也在核心处的太阳散发到宇宙中。这种情形发生在最小的事物里面，如同发生在最大的事物里面。由于所表示的是一切真理的至内层或核心处，故经上说“在城的街道与河的中央”，而不是说“在河的两边”，尽管所指的就是在两边。当主在至内层或核心处时，一切爱与仁的良善皆通过祂存在，并从祂发出。这一点从主自己在约翰福音中的话明显看出来：</p><p>耶稣，枝子若不常在葡萄树上，自己就不能结果子，你们若不常在我里面，也是这样。我是葡萄树，你们是枝子；常在我里面的，我也常在他里面，这人就多结果子；因为离了我，你们就不能作什么。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.4.htm">15:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.6.htm">6</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 933</h4><p>933. <a href="3927/revelation_22_2.htm">22:2</a> In between the street and the river on the one side and the other was the tree of life, which bore twelve fruits. This symbolically means that inmostly present within the doctrinal truths and consequent life in the New Church is the Lord in His Divine love, from whom flow all the goods that a person in that church does, apparently as though of himself.<p>In between means, symbolically, in the inmost, and so in everything round about (nos. <a href="44.htm">44</a>, <a href="383.htm">383</a>). The street symbolizes the church's doctrinal truth (nos. <a href="501.htm">501</a>, <a href="917.htm">917</a>). The river symbolizes an abundance of Divine truth (nos. <a href="409.htm">409</a>, <a href="932.htm">932</a>). On the one side and the other symbolizes to the right and to the left, and truth to the right is truth seen clearly, and truth to the left is truth seen dimly. For in heaven the south is to the right, which symbolizes truth seen clearly, while the north is to the left, which symbolizes truth seen dimly (no. <a href="901.htm">901</a>). The tree of life symbolizes the Lord in respect to His Divine love (no. <a href="89.htm">89</a>). Fruits symbolize the goods of love and charity that are called good works, as will be seen in the next number. The number twelve symbolizes all and is predicated of the goods and truths of the church (no. <a href="348.htm">348</a>). If we gather all of this into a single meaning, it follows that the statement, "in between the street and the river on the one side and the other was the tree of life, which bore twelve fruits," symbolically means that inmostly present within the doctrinal truths and consequent life in the New Church is the Lord in His Divine love, from whom flow all the goods that a person does, apparently as though of himself.</p><p>[2] This is the case with people who turn directly to the Lord and refrain from evils because they are sins, thus with people who will be in the Lord's New Church, which is the New Jerusalem. For people who do not turn directly to the Lord cannot be conjoined with Him, thus not with the Father either, and therefore they cannot possess the love that comes from the Divine. Indeed, it is sight that conjoins - not an intellectual sight alone, but a sight of the intellect that springs from an affection of the will. And an affection of the will is present only if a person keeps the Lord's commandments. Consequently the Lord says,<p>He who... keeps (My commandments,) it is he who loves Me... And...(I) will come to him and make (My) abode with him. (<a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>)</p><p>[3] We say "inmostly present within the doctrinal truths and consequent life in the New Church" because in spiritual matters everything comes from and emanates from what is inmost, as from a fire and its light in the center extending into the peripheries; or as from the sun, which is also in the center, come warmth and light throughout the solar system. Thus the case in the least of things is as it is in the greatest of things. Because the inmost of every truth is symbolized, therefore we say in between the street and the river, and not on either side of the river, even though that is what is meant. <sup>1</sup><p>When the Lord is inmostly present, all goods of love and charity come from and emanate from Him, as is apparent from the Lord's own words in John:<p>(Jesus said,) "As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing. (<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-6</a>)<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In fact that is not what is meant. The text interprets the meaning correctly, namely, that the tree of life stood between the street and the river. The failure of translators to interpret the meaning correctly may be assigned to their failure to understand the literal "in the middle" ([Greek]) as meaning "in between." Moreover, in the Greek, what has been taken to mean "on either side" - more literally, "on this side and that" - is a phrase that follows "street" and "river" and applies to both, so that the meaning is, not "in the middle of the street and on either side of the river," but "between the street and the river on the one side and the other." I.e., "between the street on the one side and the river on the other." The construction reflects Hebrew and Aramaic grammar. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 933</h4><p>933. [verse 2] 'In the midst of the street and of the river on this side and on that is a tree of life bearing twelve fruits' signifies that in the inmost things of the truths (veritas) of the doctrine and consequently of the life in the [New] Church is the Lord in His Divine Love, from Whom are flowing forth all the goods that a man does apparently as of himself. By 'in the midst' is signified in the inmost, and thence in the things around (<a href="44.htm">44</a>, <a href="383.htm">383</a>). By 'the street' is signified the truth of the Church's doctrine (<a href="501.htm">501</a>, <a href="917.htm">917</a>). By 'the river' is signified Divine Truth in abundance (<a href="409.htm">409</a>, <a href="932.htm">932</a>). 'On this side and on that (hinc et hinc)' signifies on the right and on the left, and the truth on the right is what is in clarity and on the left what is in obscurity; for the south in heaven, by which is signified truth in clarity, is on the right, and the north, by which is signified truth in obscurity, is on the left (<a href="901.htm">901</a>). By 'a tree of life' is signified the Lord as to Divine Love (<a href="89.htm">89</a>). By 'fruits' are signified the goods of love and charity that are called good works, treated of in the following paragraph. By 'twelve' are signified all, and it is said of the goods and truths of the Church (<a href="348.htm">348</a>). From these things gathered together into one meaning it follows that by 'in the midst of the street and of the river on this side and on that is a tree of life bearing twelve fruits' is signified that in the inmost things of the truths (veritas) of the doctrine and of the life in the New Church is the Lord in His Divine Love, from Whom are flowing forth all the goods that a man does apparently as of himself.</p><p>[2] This comes to pass with those who approach the Lord directly and flee from evils because they are sins, thus who will be in the Lord's New Church, which is the New Jerusalem; for those who do not approach the Lord directly cannot be conjoined to Himself, nor thus to the Father, and consequently cannot be in the love that is from the Divine. For visibility (aspectus) conjoins, not an intellectual visibility only, but an intellectual visibility derived from an affection of the will, and an affection of the will is not given unless a man does His precepts; and therefore the Lord says:<p>He who does My precepts, that one loves Me, and I will come unto Him and make an abode with him. <a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>.</p><p>[3] It is said 'in the inmost things of the truths (veritas) of the doctrine and consequently of the life in the New Church,' because in spiritual things all things exist and proceed from the inmost, as fire and light at the centre [proceed] into the circumferences; or as from the sun, which also is at the centre, heat and light [proceed] into the universe. It takes place thus in the least things as in the greatest. Because the inmost of every truth is signified, therefore it is said 'in the midst of the street and of the river' and not 'on each side of the river,' although this is understood. That from the Lord, while He is in the inmost, all the goods of love and charity exist and proceed is plain from the words of the Lord Himself in John:<p>Jesus said, As the branch cannot bear fruit from itself, unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me. I am the Vine, you are the branches: he who abides in Me and I in him, this one bears much fruit, because without Me you cannot do anything. <a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-6</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 933</h4><p>933. Verse 2. (<a href="3927/revelation_22_2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>) In the midst of the street of it and of the river, on this side and on that, was the tree of life bearing twelve fruits, signifies that in the inmosts of the truths of doctrine and thence of life in the church is the Lord in His Divine love, from Whom all the goods which man does apparently as of himself, flow forth. By "in the midst" is signified in the inmost, and thence in all things around, (<a href="44.htm">44</a>[1-2], <a href="383.htm">383</a>). By "street" is signified the truth of doctrine of the church, (<a href="501.htm">501</a>, <a href="917.htm">917</a>). By "the river" is signified Divine truth in abundance, (<a href="409.htm">409</a>, <a href="932.htm">932</a>). "On this side and on that" signifies on the right and on the left; and truth on the right is what is in clearness, and on the left what is in obscurity; for the south in heaven, by which truth in clearness is signified, is to the right; and the north, by which is signified truth in obscurity, is to the left, (<a href="901.htm">901</a>). By "the tree of life" is signified the Lord as to the Divine love, (<a href="89.htm">89</a>). By "fruits" are signified the goods of love and charity, which are called good works; which are treated of in the following article. By "twelve" are signified all, and it is said of the goods and truths of the church, (<a href="348.htm">348</a>). From these things collected into one sense, it follows that by "in the midst of the street and of the river, on this side and on that, was the tree of life bearing twelve fruits," is signified that in the inmosts of the truths of doctrine and of life in the New Church is the Lord in His Divine love, from Whom all the goods which a man does apparently as of himself flow forth.</p><p>[2] This takes place with those who go to the Lord immediately, and shun evils because they are sins; thus who will be in the Lord's New Church, which is the New Jerusalem. For they who do not go immediately to the Lord cannot be conjoined to Him, and thus neither to the Father, and hence cannot be in the love which is from the Divine; for the looking to Him conjoins, not a mere intellectual looking, but an intellectual looking from the affection of the will; and affection of the will is not given, unless man keeps His commandments; wherefore the Lord says:<p>He that doeth My commandments, he it is that loveth me; and I will come unto him, and make an abode with him, (<a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>).</p><p>[3] It is said, in the inmosts of the truths of doctrine and thence of life in the New Church, because in spiritual things all things are and all things proceed from the inmost, as from fire and light in the center to the circumferences; or as from the sun, which is also in the center, heat and light flow into the universe; it takes place thus in the least things as in the greatest. Because the inmost of all truth is signified, it is therefore said, "in the midst of the street and of the river," and not on both sides of the river, although this is meant. That from the Lord, when He is in the inmost, all the goods of love and charity are and proceed, is manifest from the words of the Lord Himself in John:<p>Jesus said, As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, so neither can ye, except ye abide in Me. I am the Vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without Me ye cannot do anything, (<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-6</a>). </p>

Hoc fit apud illos qui Dominum immediate adeunt, ac fugiunt mala quia sunt peccata, ita qui in Nova Domini Ecclesia, quae est Nova Hierosolyma, erunt; nam qui non immediate adeunt Dominum, non possunt Ipsi conjungi, ita nec Patri, et inde non possunt in amore qui a Divino est, esse: aspectus enim conjungit; non aspectus intellectualis solus, sed aspectus intellectualis ex affectione voluntatis; et affectio voluntatis non datur, nisi homo faciat praecepta Ipsius. Quare Dominus dicit, <p>"Qui facit praecepta Mea, ille amat Me, et ad illum veniam, et mansionem apud illum faciam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_933/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_21-24" target=_top>Johannes 14:21-24</a>).<p>Dicitur in intimis veritatum doctrinae et inde vitae in Nova Ecclesia, quia in spiritualibus ab intimo sunt omnia et procedunt omnia, sicut ab igne et luce in centro in peripherias; aut sicut a Sole, qui etiam est in centro, calor et lux in universum; ita fit in minimis ut in maximis: quia intimum omnis veri significatur, ideo dicitur "in medio plateae et fluvii," et non ab utraque parte fluvii, tametsi hoc intelligitur. Quod a Domino, dum est in intimo, sint et procedant omnia bona amoris et charitatis, patet ab Ipsius Domini verbis apud Johannem: <p>Jesus dixit," Quemadmodum palmes non potest fructum ferre a se ipso, nisi manserit in vite, ita neque vos nisi in Me manseritis: Ego sum Vitis, vos palmites: qui manet in Me et Ego in illo, hic fert fructum multum, quia sine Me non potestis facere quicquam, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_933/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_4-6" target=_top>15:4-6</a>). </p>
