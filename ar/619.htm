<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>619.“从地上买来的”表他们就是那些能被主重生，因而在世上被救赎的人。“从地上买来”表示在世上被救赎；救赎是从地狱中解脱出来，通过与主结合而得救（<a href="281.htm">281</a>节）；这一切通过重生来成就，故“买来的”表示那些被主重生，从而救赎的人；由于若愿意，谁都能被重生，因而被救赎，只是很少有人愿意，所以“从地上买来的”表示那些能被主重生，因而被救赎的人；现在（<a href="4.htm">4</a>，<a href="5.htm">5</a>节）则描述这些人都是谁。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 619</h4><p>619. Who were redeemed from the earth. This symbolically means that they are people who could be regenerated by the Lord and so be redeemed in the world.<p>The redeemed from the earth symbolize people redeemed in the world. That redemption is deliverance from hell, and salvation by conjunction with the Lord, may be seen in no. <a href="281.htm">281</a>. And because this is achieved by regeneration, therefore the redeemed symbolize people regenerated and redeemed by the Lord. Moreover, because all people can be regenerated and thus redeemed if they are willing to be, and few are willing, therefore the redeemed from the earth symbolize that they are people who could be regenerated by the Lord and thus redeemed.<p>The character of these people is now described in verses <a href="3927/revelation_14_4.htm">4</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_14_5.htm">5</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 619</h4><p>619. 'Bought from the earth' signifies that they are those who could be regenerated and thus redeemed in the world. By those 'bought from the earth' are signified those redeemed in the world. That redemption is liberation from hell, and salvation by means of conjunction with the Lord, may be seen (<a href="281.htm">281</a>); and since this is effected by regeneration, therefore by those 'bought' are signified those regenerated and thus redeemed by the Lord. And because all can be regenerated and redeemed, if they will, and few are willing, therefore by 'bought from the earth' is signified that they are those who could be regenerated by the Lord and thus redeemed. What these are like is now described (verses 4-5). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 619</h4><p>619. Bought from the earth, signifies that they are such as can be regenerated by the Lord and thus redeemed in the world. By "bought from the earth," is signified redeemed in the world; that redemption is deliverance from hell, and salvation by conjunction with the Lord, may be seen, (<a href="281.htm">281</a>); and since this is effected by regeneration, therefore by "those bought" are signified they who are regenerated and thus redeemed by the Lord; and since all may be regenerated and thus redeemed, if they will, and few are willing, therefore by "those bought from the earth" is signified that they are those who could be regenerated by the Lord, and thus redeemed; who these are, is now described (verses <a href="3927/revelation_14_4.htm">4-5</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 619 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>619. "Empti de terra," significat quod illi sint qui a Domino potuerunt regenerari et sic redimi in Mundo. - Per "emptos de terra" significantur redempti in mundo; quod redemptio sit liberatio ab Inferno, et salvatio per conjunctionem cum Domino, videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_619/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_281" target=_top>281</a>; et quia hoc fit per regenerationem, ideo per "emptos" significantur regenerati et sic redempti a Domino; et quia omnes possunt regenerari et sic redimi si volunt, et pauci volunt, ideo per "emptos de terra" significatur quod illi sint qui a Domino potuerunt regenerari et sic redimi: quales hi sunt, describitur nunc (vers. 4 et 5). </p>
