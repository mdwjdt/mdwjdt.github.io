<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第607节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>607.启13:18.“在这里有智慧”表通过本章的阐述和解释明白并理解神职人员关于神和救恩的教义和信仰的性质，是智者的一部分。经上之所以说“在这里”，因为这些事就是本章所阐述和解释的，尤其是关于“从地中上来的兽”的，这“兽”表示神职人员关于神和救恩的教义和由此而来的信仰（<a href="594.htm">594</a>节），因为本节所包含的事就论及这兽；由于明白并理解这教义和由此而来的信仰是什么是智者或智慧的一部分，故经上说“在这里有智慧”。</p>

This symbolically means that from what we have said and explained in this chapter, it is the part of a wise person to see and understand the nature of the doctrine and faith among the clergy regarding God and salvation.<p>"Here," the verse says, because it means those things that we have said and explained in this chapter, particularly about the beast from the earth, which symbolizes the doctrine and consequent faith regarding God and salvation among the clergy (no. <a href="594.htm">594</a>). For what this verse says has to do with that beast. And because it is the part of a wise person, or of wisdom, to see and understand the nature of that doctrine and consequent faith, the verse says, "Here is wisdom." </p>

Here is wisdom, signifies that it is the part of a wise man, from what has been said and explained in this chapter, to see and understand the quality of the doctrine and faith of the clergy concerning God and salvation. It is said "here," because those things are meant which are declared and explained in this chapter, specifically concerning "the beast out of the earth," by which is signified the doctrine and thence the faith of the clergy concerning God and salvation, (<a href="594.htm">594</a>), for the things contained in this verse are said of that beast; and as it is the part of a wise man, or of wisdom, to see and understand what that doctrine and thence the faith is, it is said, "Here is wisdom." </p>

Hic sapientia est," significat quod sapientis sit ex illis, quae in hoc capite dicta et explicata sunt, videre et intelligere, qualis est doctrina et fides de Deo et de salvatione apud Clericos. - Dicitur "hic" quia intelliguntur illa quae in hoc capite dicta et explicata sunt, in specie quae de "Bestia ex Terra," per quam significatur doctrina et inde fides de Deo et de salvatione apud Clericos (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_607/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_594" target=_top>594</a>), nam de hac Bestia, haec, quae in hoc versu, dicuntur; et quia sapientis, seu sapientiae, est, videre et intelligere qualis illa doctrina et inde fides est, dicitur, "Hic sapientia est." </p>
