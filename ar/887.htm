<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第887节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>887.启21:6.“祂又对我说，都成了”表这是神性真理。“祂对我说”之所以表示这是神性的真理，是因为主第三次说“对我说”；还因为祂用现在时说“成了”；主第三次所说的，就是应当相信的，因为这是神性真理，如祂以现在时所说的也是如此；“三”表示直到终结的完整之物（<a href="505.htm">505</a>节）；同样，当即将做一件事时，祂就会说“成了”。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 887</h4><p>887. <a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a> And He said to me, "It is done!" This symbolically means that it is the Divine truth.<p>His saying to me means, symbolically, that it is the Divine truth because the Lord said for the third time, "He said to me," and because He said "It is done!" in the present tense. Whatever the Lord says a third time is something to be believed, because it is the Divine truth, and also what He says in the present tense. For three times symbolizes something completed to the end (no. <a href="505.htm">505</a>), and so, too, when He is about to do something, we are told, "It is done!" </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 887</h4><p>887. [verse 6] 'And He said unto me, It is done' signifies that it is the Divine Truth (veritas). The reason why by 'He said unto me, It is done' is signified that it is the Divine Truth (veritas) is because the Lord a third time said 'He said unto me,' also because He said 'It is done' in the present tense; and what the Lord says a third time is what is to be believed because it is a Divine truth, as well what He says in the present tense; for 'three times' signifies what is complete to the end (<a href="505.htm">505</a>). In like manner when [something] is going to be done it is said, 'It is done.' </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 887</h4><p>887. Verse 6. And He said unto me, It is done, signifies that it is the Divine truth. The reason why by "He said unto me" is signified that it is the Divine truth is because the Lord said a third time, "He said unto me;" also because He said "it is done" in the present tense; and what the Lord says a third time is what ought to be believed, because it is the Divine truth, as also what He said in the present tense; for "three signifies what is complete to the end" (<a href="505.htm">505</a>); in like manner when being about to do a thing, He said, "It is done." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 887 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>887. (Vers. 6.) "Et dixit mihi, Factum est," significat quod sit Divina Veritas. - Quod per "dixit mihi" significetur quod sit Divina veritas, est quia Dominus tertio dixit, "dixit mihi," tum quia dixit "factum est" in praesenti: et quod Dominus tertio dicit, est quod credendum sit quia est Divina veritas, tum quod dicit in praesenti: "ter" enim significat completum ad finem (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_887/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_505" target=_top>505</a>); similiter cum facturus dicitur "factum est." </p>
