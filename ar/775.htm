<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>775.“各样极宝贵的木头和铜，铁，大理石的器皿”表他们不再拥有这些事物，因为他们没有与这类事物相对应的在教会事物上的科学良善和真理。这些类似于上述事物（<a href="772.htm">772</a>-<a href="774.htm">774</a>节），不同之处在于，这些事物表示知识，知识是人属世心智的终端或最表层。因为这些在品质上不同于它们里面的本质，故它们被称为“极宝贵的木头和铜，铁，大理石的器皿”。事实上，“器皿”表示知识，在此表示在教会事物上的知识，因为知识是盛纳良善与真理的容器，就像器皿是盛纳油和酒的容器。知识多种多样，它们的容器是记忆。它们之所以具有多样性，是因为人的内在事物在它们里面。它们还要么通过脑力思考，要么通过聆听或阅读，照着当时出于理性不断变化的觉察而被引入记忆。所有这些事内在地存于知识之中，当它们再现时，这一点是显而易见的。当此人说话或思考时，它们就会再现。</p><p>在此简要说明“各样极宝贵的木头和铜，铁，大理石的器皿”表示什么。“极宝贵木头的器皿”表示源于理性良善和真理的知识；“铜的器皿”表示源于属世良善的知识；“铁的器皿”表示源于属世真理的知识；“大理石的器皿”表示源于良善和真理的表象的知识。“木”表示良善（参看<a href="774.htm">774</a>节）。“极宝贵的木头”在此表示理性的良善和真理，因为“木”表示良善，“宝贵”论及真理；事实上，橄榄树的木头表示一种良善，香柏树、无花果树、杉树、杨树和橡树的木头表示另一种良善。“铜与铁的器皿”表示源于属世良善和真理的知识，因为在圣言中，一切金属，如金、银、铜、铁、锡、铅等，表示良善和真理。它们之所以表示，是因为它们对应；并且由于对应，所以它们也存在于天上，事实上，天上的一切事物都是对应。</p><p>不过，此处不宜通过圣言来证实每种金属由于对应表示什么，只通过一些经文来证实，“铜”表示属世良善，因而“铁”表示属世真理；这一点从以经文可以看出来：</p><p>人子的脚好像在炉中锻炼发光的铜。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.15.htm">1:15</a>）</p><p>但以理见有一人脚如抛光的铜。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.5.htm">10:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>基路伯的脚灿烂如抛光的铜。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.7.htm">1:7</a>）</p><p>“脚”表示属世之物（参看<a href="49.htm">49</a>，<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="470.htm">470</a>，<a href="510.htm">510</a>节）。</p><p>有一位天使形状如铜。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.3.htm">40:3</a>）</p><p>尼布甲尼撒梦见的大像，头是精金的，胸膛和膀臂是银的，肚腹和腰是铜的，腿是铁的。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.32.htm">2:32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.33.htm">33</a>）</p><p>这个像代表教会的相继状态，这些状态被古人称为“黄金、白银、青铜和黑铁”时代。由于“铜”表示属世之物，而以色列人是纯属世的，故主的属世层以“铜蛇”来代表，凡被蛇咬的，只要望一望铜蛇便可痊愈（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民2.1.htm">2:1</a>: 6，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民2.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民2.9.htm">9</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.14.htm">3:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.15.htm">15</a>）。“铜”表示属世良善，这一点也可见于其它地方（如以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.17.htm">60:17</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶15.20.htm">15:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶15.21.htm">21</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.13.htm">27:13</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申8.7.htm">8:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申8.9.htm">9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.24.htm">33:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.25.htm">25</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 775</h4><p>775. "Every vessel of precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble." This symbolically means that these Roman Catholics no longer have these because they do not have any knowledge of the goods and truths in ecclesiastical affairs to which such things correspond.<p>This statement is similar to the ones explained in nos. <a href="772.htm">772</a>, <a href="773.htm">773</a>, and <a href="774.htm">774</a> above. The difference is that the valuables here are various forms of knowledge, which are the lowest ones in a person's natural mind. And because they differ in character owing to the essence that lies within them, they are called vessels of precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble. For vessels symbolize forms of knowledge, here forms of knowledge in ecclesiastical affairs. Because various forms of knowledge are the containing vessels of goodness and truth, they are like vessels containing oil or wine.<p>Forms of knowledge are also found in great variety, and their recipient vessel is the memory. They are of great variety because they contain the interior elements of a person. They are also introduced into the memory either by intellectual deliberation or by hearing or reading them, according to the varying perception then of the rational mind. All of these things are present in forms of knowledge, as is apparent when they are reproduced, which is the case when a person speaks or thinks.</p><p>[2] But we will briefly say what vessels of precious wood, bronze, iron and marble symbolize. A vessel of precious wood symbolizes something known as the result of rational goodness and truth. A vessel of bronze symbolizes something known as the result of natural goodness. A vessel of iron symbolizes something known as the result of natural truth. And a vessel of marble symbolizes something known as the result of an appearance of goodness and truth.<p>That wood symbolizes goodness may be seen just above in no. 774. That precious wood here symbolizes both rational goodness and rational truth is due to the fact that wood symbolizes goodness, and preciousness is predicated of truth. For one variety of goodness is symbolized by the wood of the olive tree, another by the wood of the cedar, of the fig tree, of the fir tree, of the poplar and of the oak.<p>A vessel of bronze and iron symbolizes something known as the result of natural goodness and truth, because all metals, such as gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, and lead, in the Word symbolize goods and truths. They symbolize because they correspond, and because they correspond they are also found in heaven. For everything in heaven is a correspondent form.</p><p>[3] However, this is not the place to confirm from the Word what each kind of metal symbolizes owing to its correspondence. We will cite only some passages to confirm that bronze symbolizes natural goodness, and iron, therefore, natural truth, as can be seen from the following: That the feet of the Son of Man looked like bronze, as though fired in a furnace (<a href="3927/revelation_1_15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>). That Daniel saw a man whose feet were like the gleam of burnished bronze (<a href="3927/daniel_10_5.htm">Daniel 10:5-6</a>).<p>That the feet of cherubim were seen sparking as with the gleam of burnished bronze (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a>). (Feet symbolize something natural, as may be seen in nos. <a href="49.htm">49</a>, <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="470.htm">470</a>, <a href="510.htm">510</a>.) That an angel appears whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3</a>). And that the statue Nebuchadnezzar saw was as to its head golden, as to its breast and arms silver, as to its belly and sides bronze, and as to its legs iron (<a href="3927/daniel_2_32.htm">Daniel 2:32-33</a>). The statue represented the successive states of the church which the ancients called the golden age, silver age, bronze age, and iron age.<p>Since bronze symbolizes something natural, and the Israelite people were purely natural, therefore the Lord's natural humanity was represented by the bronze serpent, which people bitten by serpents had only to look at to be cured (<a href="3927/numbers_21_6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_21_8.htm">8-9</a>).<p>That bronze symbolizes natural goodness may also be seen in <a href="3927/isaiah_60_17.htm">Isaiah 60:17</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_15_20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20-21</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_8_7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_8_9.htm">9</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_24.htm">33:24-25</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 775</h4><p>775. 'And every vessel of precious wood, and of bronze and iron and marble' signifies that they no longer have these things because they do not have the scientific goods and truths in the things of the Church (scientifica bona et vera in rebus Ecclesiae) to which such things correspond. These are similar to the things that have been expounded above (<a href="772.htm">772-774</a>), with the difference that by these are signified the knowledges (scientifica) that are the ultimates of a man's natural mind. Because these differ in quality from the essence that is in them they are called 'vessels of precious wood, of bronze, of iron and marble.' For by the 'vessels' are signified the knowledges, here in the things of the Church, because knowledges are containants of good and truth just as vessels are containants of oil and wine. The knowledges also exist in great variety, and their receptacle is the memory. The reason that they are of great variety is because the man's interior things are in them. Also they are introduced into the memory as a result either of intellectual thought or of hearing or reading and in accordance with the changing perception out of the rational at the time. All these things are inwardly in the knowledges, which is evident when they are reproduced. This is done when the man speaks or thinks.</p><p>[2] But what is signified by 'vessels of precious wood, of bronze, of iron and of marble' will be stated in a few words. By 'a vessel of precious wood' is signified knowledge derived from rational good and truth; by' a vessel of bronze' is signified knowledge derived from natural good; by 'a vessel of iron' is signified knowledge derived from natural truth; and by 'a vessel of marble' is signified knowledge derived from appearances of good and truth. That 'wood' signifies good may be seen just above (<a href="774.htm">774</a>). That here by 'precious wood' is signified good and at the same time rational truth is because 'wood' signifies good and 'precious' is predicated of truth; for one kind of good is signified by the wood of an olive tree, another by that of a cedar tree, a fig tree, a fir, a poplar and an oak. That 'a vessel of bronze and iron' signifies knowledge derived from natural good and truth is because all the metals, as gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin and lead in the Word signify goods and truths. They signify because they correspond, and because they correspond they exist also in heaven, for all the things there are correspondences.</p><p>[3] This, however, is not the place to confirm out of the Word what each of the metals signifies as the result of correspondence, but only to confirm by some passages that' bronze signifies natural good, and consequently 'iron' natural truth, as may be seen from these that:<p>The feet of the Son of Man were seen like bronze, as if burned in a furnace. <a href="3927/revelation_1_15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>.<p>By Daniel was seen a Man whose feet were as the brightness of polished bronze. <a href="3927/daniel_10_5.htm">Daniel 10:5-6</a>.<p>Also the feet of the cherubs were seen sparkling like the brightness of polished bronze. <a href="3927/ezekiel_1_7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a>.<p>That 'feet' signify what is natural may be seen (<a href="49.htm">49</a>, <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="470.htm">470</a>, <a href="510.htm">510</a>).<p>An angel was seen like the appearance of bronze. <a href="3927/ezekiel_40_3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3</a>.<p>The statue seen by Nebuchadnezzar was as to its head gold, as to its breast and arms silver, as to its belly and side bronze, as to the legs iron. <a href="3927/daniel_2_32.htm">Daniel 2:32-33</a>.<p>By this statue the successive states of the Church were represented, which by the ancients were termed the golden, silver, bronze and iron ages. Since 'bronze' signifies what is natural and the Israelitish people was purely natural, therefore the Lord's Natural was represented by:<p>The bronze serpent which those bitten by serpents should look upon and be healed. <a href="3927/numbers_21_6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_21_8.htm">8-9</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_14.htm">John 3:14-15</a>.<p>That 'bronze' signifies natural good can also be seen in <a href="3927/isaiah_60_17.htm">Isaiah 60:17</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_15_20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20-21</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_8_7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_8_9.htm">9</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_24.htm">33:24-25</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 775</h4><p>775. And every vessel of precious wood, and of brass and iron and marble, signifies that they no longer have these, because they have not the scientific goods and truths in matters of the church, to which such things correspond. These are similar to the things explained above, (<a href="772.htm">772-774</a>); with the difference, that by these the scientifics which are the ultimates of man's natural mind are meant, which, as they differ in quality from the essence that is in them, are called vessels of precious wood, of brass, of iron and of marble. For by "vessels" are signified scientifics here in matters of the church; because scientifics are the containants of good and truth, as vessels are the containants of oil and wine. Scientifics are also in great variety, and their receptacle is the memory. That they are of great variety is because man's interiors are in them; they are also introduced into the memory either from intellectual thought, or from hearing, or from reading, and then according to the various perception from the rational. All these are within scientifics; which appears when they are reproduced, which happens when the man speaks or thinks.</p><p>[2] But what is signified by "vessels of precious wood, of brass, of iron, and of marble," shall be briefly told. By "a vessel of precious wood" is signified a scientific from rational good and truth; by "a vessel of brass" a scientific from natural good is signified; by "a vessel of iron," a scientific from natural truth is signified; and by "a vessel of marble" is signified a scientific from the appearance of good and truth. That "wood" signifies good may be seen just above, (<a href="774.htm">774</a>). That good and at the same time rational truth are here signified by "precious wood," is because "wood" signifies good, and "precious" is predicated of truth; for one kind of good is signified by the wood of the olive tree, another by that of the cedar, the fig, the fir, the poplar, and the oak. That "a vessel of brass and of iron" signifies what is scientific from natural good and truth, is because all the metals, as gold, silver, brass, iron, tin, lead, in the Word, signify goods and truths. They signify because they correspond; and because they correspond, they are also in heaven; for all things there are correspondences.</p><p>[3] But what each of the metals signifies from correspondence, this is not the place to confirm from the Word; only to show by a few passages that "brass" signifies natural good, and hence "iron" natural truth; as may be seen from these:<p>That the feet of the Son of man appeared like unto brass, as if glowing in a furnace, (<a href="3927/revelation_1_15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>).<p>That there appeared to Daniel a man whose feet were as the brightness of polished brass, (<a href="3927/daniel_10_5.htm">Daniel 10:5-6</a>).<p>That the feet of the cherubim also appeared glittering as the brightness of polished brass, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a>).<p>That the feet signify the natural, may be seen, (<a href="49.htm">49</a>[1-8], <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="470.htm">470</a>, <a href="510.htm">510</a>[1-2]).<p>That an angel was seen like the appearance of brass, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3</a>).<p>That the statue seen by Nebuchadnezzar was as to its head gold, as to the breast and arms silver, as to the belly and side brass, as to the legs iron, (<a href="3927/daniel_2_32.htm">Daniel 2:32-33</a>).<p>By which statue the successive states of the church were represented, which were called by the ancients the ages of gold, silver, brass, and iron. Since "brass" signified the natural, and the Israelitish people were merely natural, therefore the Lord's natural was represented by:<p>The Brazen Serpent, which they that were bitten by the serpents should look upon, and be healed, (<a href="3927/numbers_21_6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_21_8.htm">8-9</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_14.htm">John 3:14-15</a>).<p>That "brass" signifies natural good may also be seen in <a href="3927/isaiah_60_17.htm">Isaiah 60:17</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_15_20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20-21</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_8_7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_8_9.htm">9</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_24.htm">33:24-25</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 775 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>775. "Et omne vas ex ligno pretioso et aere et ferro et marmore," significat quod haec illis non amplius sint, quia non sunt illis scientifica bona et vera in rebus Ecclesiae, quibus talia correspondent. - Haec similia sunt cum illis, quae supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_775/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_772" target=_top>772</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_775/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_773" target=_top>773</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_775/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774" target=_top>774</a>) explicata sunt; cum differentia, quod per haec significentur scientifica, quae ultima naturalis mentis hominis sunt; quae, quia differunt qualitate ex essentia quae in illis, dicuntur "vasa ex ligno pretioso, ex aere, ex ferro et ex marmore," per "vasa" enim significantur scientifica, hic in rebus Ecclesiae; quia scientifica sunt continentia boni et veri, sicut sunt vasa continentia olei et vini. Scientifica etiam sunt in multa varietate, et receptaculum eorum est memoria. Quod sint ex multa varietate, est quia interiora hominis sunt in illis; immittuntur etiam in memoriam vel ex intellectuali cogitatione, vel ex auditione, vel ex lectione, et tunc secundum variam perceptionem ex rationali; haec omnia intus in scientificis sunt, quod apparet quando reproducuntur, quod fit cum homo loquitur aut cogitat. Quid autem per "vasa ex ligno pretioso, ex aere, ex ferro et ex marmore" significatur, paucis dicetur: per "vas ex ligno pretioso" significatur scientificum ex bono et vero rationali; per "vas ex aere" significatur scientificum ex bono naturali; per "vas ex ferro" significatur scientificum ex vero naturali; et per "vas ex marmore" significatur scientificum ex apparentia boni et veri. Quod "lignum" significet bonum, videatur mox supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_775/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774" target=_top>774</a>); <sup>1</sup>quod hic per "lignum pretiosum" significetur bonum et simul verum rationale, est quia "lignum" significat bonum, et "pretiosum" praedicatur de vero; nam aliud bonum significatur per lignum ex arbore oleae, aliud ex arbore cedri, ficus, abietis, populi et quercus. Quod "vas ex aere et ferro" significet scientificum ex bono et vero naturali, est quia omnia metalla, ut aurum, argentum, aes, ferrum, stannum, plumbum, in Verbo significant bona et vera; significant quia correspondent, et quia correspondent etiam in Caelo sunt; sunt enim omnia ibi correspondentiae.
