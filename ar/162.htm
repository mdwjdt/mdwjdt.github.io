<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>162.“又要遵守，并要悔改”表他们应留心这些事，使其已死的敬拜获得生命。显然，“遵守”就是留心“要回想你是怎样领受，怎样听见的”所表示的那些事；由此可知，“悔改”就是通过出于圣言的真理和照之的生活而使死的敬拜获得生命。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 162</h4><p>162. "'And pay heed and repent.'" This symbolically means that they should pay attention to these things and give life to their lifeless worship.<p>It is evident that to pay heed is to pay attention to those things that are meant by the directive, "Remember therefore how you have received and heard." And it follows then that to repent is to give life to their lifeless worship through truths from the Word and by a life in accordance with them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 162</h4><p>162. 'And observe and repent' signifies so that they may pay attention to those things, and vivify their dead worship. It is plain that 'to observe' is to pay attention to the things that are understood by 'Remember how thou hast accepted and heard'; and it consequently follows that 'to repent' is to vivify dead worship by means of truths out of the Word and a life in accordance with them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 162</h4><p>162. And observe and repent, signifies that they should attend to these things and vivify their dead worship. That "to observe" is to attend to those things which are meant by "Remember how thou hast received and heard," is evident; and that "to repent" is to vivify dead worship, by truths from the Word, and by a life according to them, follows therefrom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 162 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>162. "Et observa et resipisce," significat ut attendant ad illa, et cultum suum mortuum vivificent. - Quod "observare" sit attendere ad illa quae intelliguntur per "Memento quomodo acceperis et audiveris," patet; et quod "resipiscere" sit cultum mortuum per vera ex Verbo et per vitam secundum illa vivificare, inde sequitur. </p>
