<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第731节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>731.“我看见她，就大大地希奇”表对该宗教内在是这样，外在却不是这样感到大为惊讶。“大大地希奇”是指大为惊讶；“看见她”表示这个女人，就是天主教，内在是这样，外在却不是这样；因为他惊讶地发现这个女人坐在朱红色的兽上，穿着紫色和朱红色、嵌有金子宝石珍珠的衣服，手拿金杯，这些事物都是她表面的形像，然而杯中盛满了可憎之物和她淫乱的污秽。约翰还看到在她额上写着“地上的淫乱和可憎之物的母”，这些是她的内在。约翰之所以说这些话，是因为即便今日，每个人在看到这个宗教外在如此神圣和辉煌，殊不知内在却如此亵渎和可憎时也是大为惊讶的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 731</h4><p>731. And when I saw her, I wondered with great wonder. This symbolizes astonishment that the Roman Catholic religion is of such a character interiorly, when indeed it appears otherwise outwardly.<p>To wonder with great wonder is to be greatly astonished. John's seeing her means symbolically that the woman, which is to say, the Roman Catholic religion, is of such a character interiorly, when indeed it appears otherwise outwardly. For John was astonished at seeing the woman sitting on a scarlet beast, arrayed in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold, precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup - which was the way she looked in outward appearance - and yet her cup was full of abomination and the filthiness of licentiousness. Moreover, on her forehead was written the legend, "the Mother of the Whoredoms and Abominations of the Earth," which was her internal character.<p>John said this because no one even at this day can but be astonished at seeing this expression of religion, so reverent and grand in outward appearances, not knowing that it is so profane and abhorrent interiorly. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 731</h4><p>731. 'And I wondered, seeing her with a great wonder' signifies astonishment at that form of religion being such interiorly, when yet exteriorly it appears otherwise. 'To wonder with a great wonder' is to be exceedingly astonished. 'Seeing her' signifies that the woman, that is, the form of religion is such interiorly, when yet outwardly it appears otherwise. For he was astonished at seeing the woman sitting upon the scarlet beast, arrayed with purple and scarlet, decked with gold, precious stone and pearls, having the golden cup in her hand, which things were the appearances thereof in externals; and yet the cup was full of the abomination and uncleanness of whoredom, and he saw written on her forehead 'the mother of the whoredoms and abominations of the land,' which things are the internals thereof. These things were said by John, because anyone even at this day cannot but be astonished when he sees that form of religion so holy and magnificent in externals, and does not know that it is so profane and abominable in internals. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 731</h4><p>731. And when I saw her I wondered with great wonder, signifies astonishment that that religious persuasion is such interiorly, when, nevertheless, it appears otherwise exteriorly. "To wonder with great wonder" is to be greatly astonished; "seeing her" signifies that the woman, that is, the religious persuasion, is such interiorly, when nevertheless it appears otherwise exteriorly; for he was astonished to see the woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, arrayed in purple and scarlet, inwrought with gold, precious stones, and pearls, and having a golden cup in her hand, which things were her outward appearance, and yet the cup was full of abominations and uncleanness of whoredom. And he saw written in her forehead, "Mother of whoredoms and abominations of the earth," which are her internals. These things were said by John, because everyone even at this day cannot but be astonished at seeing that religious persuasion so holy and splendid in externals, not knowing that it is so profane and abominable in internals. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 731 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>731. "Et admiratus sum videns illam admiratione magna," significat stuporem quod Religiosum illud tale sit interius, cum tamen aliter apparet exterius. -"Admirari admiratione magna," est obstupescere valde; "videns illam" significat quod Mulier, hoc est, Religiosum, tale sit interius, cum tamen aliter apparet exterius; obstupuit enim, quod videret Mulierem sedentem super Bestia coccinea indutam purpura et coccino, inauratam auro, lapide pretioso et margaritis, habentem poculum aureum in manu sua, quae erant apparentiae ejus in externis, et tamen poculum erat plenum abominatione et immunditie scortationis; ac in fronte vidit scriptum, "Mater scortationum et abominationum terrae," quae sunt interna ejus. Haec a Johanne dicta sunt, quia unusquisque etiam hodie non potest non obstupescere, cum videt Religiosum illud tam sanctum et splendidum in externis, et non novit quod tam prophanum et abominabile sit in internis. </p>
