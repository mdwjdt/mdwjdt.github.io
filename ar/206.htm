<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第206节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>206.“因为你说：我是富足，已经发了财”表他们以为自己拥有大量属天堂和教会的良善和真理的认知。“富足，发了财”在此无非表示完全知晓并明白诸如属教会和天堂的那类事物；它们被称为属灵和神学的，因为这些就是此处所论述的；属灵的财宝和富足并不是别的什么。出于自己，而非出于主通过圣言相信的人也相信他们完全知晓并明白一切。原因在于，他们的属灵心智是关闭的，唯独其属世心智是打开的。没有属灵之光，属世心智不知道别的。在圣言中，“财宝”和“富足”表示属灵的财宝和富足，也就是真理和良善的认知。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>你靠自己的智慧聪明得了金银财宝，收入库中；你靠自己的大智慧增添资财。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.4.htm">28:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p>这论及推罗，它表示教会对真理和良善的认知。又如：</p><p>推罗的女子必给你带来礼物；王女啊，富足的人必求你的情面。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.12.htm">45:12</a>）</p><p>耶和华必使推罗贫穷；祂必将她的资财丢到海里。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.4.htm">9:4</a>）</p><p>推罗啊，他们必掳去你的财富。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结26.12.htm">26:12</a>）</p><p>亚述说，我所成就的事，是靠我手的能力和我的智慧，我本有聪明；我抢夺列民的财宝，我的手伸到列民的财富那里。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.13.htm">10:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.14.htm">14</a>）</p><p>“亚述”表理性；在此它败坏了教会的良善与真理，也就是此处他所抢夺的“列民的财宝和财富”。</p><p>我要将暗中的宝物和隐密处的宝藏赐给你。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.3.htm">45:3</a>）</p><p>敬畏耶和华的，这人便为有福；他家中有货物，有钱财，他的公义存到永远。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗112.1.htm">112:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗112.3.htm">3</a>）</p><p>神叫饥饿的得饱美食，叫富足的空手回去。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.53.htm">1:53</a>）</p><p>你们富足的人有祸了，因为你们已经享够了安乐；你们饱足的人有祸了，因为你们将要饥饿。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.24.htm">6:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.25.htm">25</a>）</p><p>“富足的”在此表示那些拥有真理和良善的认知之人，因为他们拥有圣言，这些人就是犹太人。穿着紫色袍和细麻布衣服的财主所表相同（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.19.htm">16:19</a>）；其它经文中“财主”和“财宝”也一样（如以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.6.htm">30:6</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.11.htm">17:11</a>；弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥4.13.htm">4:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥6.12.htm">6:12</a>；撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.14.htm">14:14</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.35.htm">12:35</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.44.htm">13:44</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.21.htm">12:21</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 206</h4><p>206. "'Because you say, "I am rich and wealthy."'" (<a href="3927/revelation_3_17.htm">3:17</a>) This symbolically means, because they believe they possess in great abundance concepts of goodness and truth having to do with the church and heaven.<p>To be rich and wealthy means, symbolically, nothing else here than to have full knowledge and understanding of such things as have to do with the church and heaven, things which are called spiritual and theological, because they are the subject here. Spiritual riches and wealth are nothing else.<p>People who base their beliefs on their own thinking, and not on the Lord through the Word, also believe that they know and understand everything. That is because their spiritual mind is closed and only their natural mind open, and without spiritual light the natural mind has no other sight.<p>That riches and wealth in the Word symbolize spiritual riches and wealth, which are concepts of truth and goodness, is apparent from the following passages:<p>By your wisdom and your intelligence you have gained riches for yourself..., gold and silver in your treasuries; by the increase of your wisdom... you have increased your riches... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4-5</a>)<p>This is said of Tyre, which symbolizes the church in respect to its concepts of truth and good. Similarly:<p>The daughter of Tyre (the daughter of the king) (will bring you) a gift; the rich among the people will seek to placate your face. (<a href="3927/psalms_45_12.htm">Psalms 45:12</a>)<p>...(Jehovah) will impoverish (Tyre); He will destroy its wealth in the sea... (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_4.htm">Zechariah 9:4</a>)<p>They will plunder (O Tyre) your riches... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_26_12.htm">Ezekiel 26:12</a>)<p>(Asshur said,) "By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I am intelligent...; (therefore) I... will plunder the treasures of the peoples... My hand will find... the wealth of the peoples...." (<a href="3927/isaiah_10_13.htm">Isaiah 10:13-14</a>)<p>Asshur symbolizes the rational faculty - here that it perverts the goods and truths of the church, which are the treasures and wealth of the peoples that it will plunder.<p>I will give you the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places... (<a href="3927/isaiah_45_3.htm">Isaiah 45:3</a>)<p>Blessed is the man who fears Jehovah... Wealth and riches will be in his house, and his righteousness endures forever. (<a href="3927/psalms_112_1.htm">Psalms 112:1</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_112_3.htm">3</a>)<p>(God) has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty. (<a href="3927/luke_1_53.htm">Luke 1:53</a>)<p>...woe to you who are rich, for you have received your joy. Woe to you who are filled, for you shall hunger. (<a href="3927/luke_6_24.htm">Luke 6:24-25</a>)<p>The rich here mean people who possessed concepts of truth and good because they had the Word, namely the Jews. So, too, the "rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen" (<a href="3927/luke_16_19.htm">Luke 16:19</a>).<p>The rich and riches have a similar meaning elsewhere, as in <a href="3927/isaiah_30_6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_17_11.htm">Jeremiah 17:11</a>; <a href="3927/micah_4_13.htm">Micah 4:13</a>; <a href="3927/micah_6_12.htm">6:12</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_14_14.htm">Zechariah 14:14</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_12_35.htm">Matthew 12:35</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_13_44.htm">13:44</a>; <a href="3927/luke_12_21.htm">Luke 12:21</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 206</h4><p>206. <sup>1</sup>[verse 17] 'Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods' signifies that they believe themselves to possess in great abundance the cognitions of truth and good that are of the Church and heaven. To be 'rich and increased with goods' here signifies nothing else than fully to know and understand such things as are of the Church and heaven, which are called spiritual and theological, because here [the Word] treats of those things. Spiritual riches and plenty are nothing else. Those whose belief is derived from themselves and not from the Lord through the Word, also believe themselves to know and understand all things. This is because their spiritual mind has been closed and only the natural mind opened, and without spiritual light this mind does not see otherwise. That by 'riches' and 'wealth' in the Word are signified spiritual riches and wealth, which are cognitions of good and truth, is plain from these passages:<p>In thy wisdom and in thy understanding thou hast made wealth for thyself, gold and silver in thy treasure-chambers; by the great Increase of thy wisdom thou hast greatly increased wealth for thyself. <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4-5</a>.<p>These things [are said] of Tyre, by which is signified the Church as to cognitions of truth and good. In like manner:<p>The daughter of Tyre shall bring thee a gift; O daughter of the king, the rich peoples shall entreat thy faces. <a href="3927/psalms_45_12.htm">Psalms 45:12</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_45_13.htm">13</a>].<p>Jehovah will impoverish Tyre, He will shake off her wealth in the sea, <a href="3927/zechariah_9_4.htm">Zechariah 9:4</a>.<p>O Tyre, they shall plunder thy wealth. <a href="3927/ezekiel_26_12.htm">Ezekiel 26:12</a>.<p>Asshur has said, By the strength of my hand have I done it, and through my wisdom, because I am intelligent; whence I will plunder the treasures of the peoples, my hand shall find the wealth of the peoples. <a href="3927/isaiah_10_13.htm">Isaiah 10:13-14</a>.<p>By 'Asshur' is signified the rational, here that it perverts the goods and truths of the Church, which are the 'treasures' and 'wealth' of the peoples, which he shall plunder.<p>I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and the hidden wealth of the hiding-places. <a href="3927/isaiah_45_3.htm">Isaiah 45:3</a>.<p>Blessed is the man who fears Jehovah, wealth and riches are in his house, and his justice stands for ever. <a href="3927/psalms_112_1.htm">Psalms 112:1</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_112_3.htm">3</a>.<p>God has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent empty away. <a href="3927/luke_1_53.htm">Luke 1:53</a>.<p>Woe to you that are rich, for you have taken your joy; woe to you that have been filled, for you shall hunger. <a href="3927/luke_6_24.htm">Luke 6:24-25</a>.<p>By 'the rich' here are understood those who were in possession of cognitions of good and truth, because in possession of the Word, and these were the Jews. In like manner [they are understood] by the rich man who was clothed with purple and fine linen (<a href="3927/luke_16_19.htm">Luke 16:19</a>). Likewise by 'the rich' and 'riches' elsewhere (as <a href="3927/isaiah_30_6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_17_1.htm">Jeremiah 17</a>; <a href="3927/micah_4_13.htm">Micah 4:13</a>; <a href="3927/micah_6_12.htm">6:12</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_14_14.htm">Zechariah 14:14</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_12_35.htm">Matthew 12:35</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_13_44.htm">13:44</a>; <a href="3927/luke_12_21.htm">Luke 12:21</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Number 205 is missing in the Original text. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 206</h4><p>206. <sup>1</sup>Verse 17. Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased in goods, signifies that they think they possess in all abundance the knowledges of truth and good which are of the church and heaven. "To be rich and increased in goods," here signifies nothing else than to know and understand fully such things as are of the church and heaven which are called spiritual and theological, because these are here treated of; spiritual riches and abundance are nothing else. They who believe from themselves, and not from the Lord through the Word, also believe that they know and understand all things. The reason is, that their spiritual mind is shut, and their natural mind alone open; and this mind, without spiritual light, sees no otherwise. That by "riches" and "wealth" in the Word are signified spiritual riches and wealth, which are the knowledges of truth and good, is manifest from the following passages:<p>In thy wisdom and in thy understanding thou hast gotten thee wealth, gold and silver in thy treasures; by the multiplication of thy wisdom thou hast multiplied thy wealth, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4-5</a>).<p>This is spoken of Tyre, by which is signified the church as to the knowledges of truth and good. In like manner:<p>The daughter of Tyre shall bring thee a gift; O daughter of the king, the rich peoples shall entreat thy faces, (<a href="3927/psalms_45_12.htm">Psalms 45:12</a>).<p>Jehovah will impoverish Tyre; He will shake off her wealth into the sea, (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_4.htm">Zechariah 9:4</a>).<p>O Tyre, they shall plunder thy wealth, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_26_12.htm">Ezekiel 26:12</a>).<p>Assyria said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, because I am intelligent; whence I will plunder the treasures of the peoples, my hand shall find the wealth of the peoples, (<a href="3927/isaiah_10_13.htm">Isaiah 10:13-14</a>).<p>By Assyria the rational is signified; here that it perverts the goods and truths of the church, which here are the "treasures and wealth of the peoples," which he will plunder.<p>I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and the hidden wealth of the lurking-places, (<a href="3927/isaiah_45_3.htm">Isaiah 45:3</a>).<p>Happy is the man that feareth Jehovah; wealth and riches are in his house, and his justice standeth forever, (<a href="3927/psalms_112_1.htm">Psalms 112:1</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_112_3.htm">3</a>).<p>God hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He hath sent away empty, (<a href="3927/luke_1_53.htm">Luke 1:53</a>).<p>Woe unto you that are rich, for ye have received your joy; woe unto you that are filled, for ye shall hunger, (<a href="3927/luke_6_24.htm">Luke 6:24-25</a>).<p>By the "rich" here are meant those who were in possession of the knowledges of truth and good because they had the Word, who were the Jews: the same is meant by the rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, (<a href="3927/luke_16_19.htm">Luke 16:19</a>); and in like manner by the "rich" and "riches" in other places (as in <a href="3927/isaiah_30_6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_17_11.htm">Jeremiah 17:11</a>; <a href="3927/micah_4_13.htm">Micah 4:13</a>; <a href="3927/micah_6_12.htm">6:12</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_14_14.htm">Zechariah 14:14</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_12_35.htm">Matthew 12:35</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_13_44.htm">13:44</a>; <a href="3927/luke_12_21.htm">Luke 12:21</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;205 is omitted in the original Latin without explanation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 206 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>206. (Vers. 17.) "Quod dicas; quod dives et locupletatus sim," significat quod credant se cognitiones veri et boni, quae Ecclesiae et Caeli sunt, possidere in omni copia. - "Dives et locupletatus esse" non aliud hic significat, quam plene scire ac intelligere talia quae Ecclesiae et Caeli sunt, quae spiritualia et theologica vocantur, quia hic de illis agitur; divitiae et copiae spirituales non aliud sunt. Illi, qui ex se credunt, et non ex Domino per Verbum, etiam credunt se scire et intelligere omnia; causa est, quia mens eorum spiritualis clausa est; et solum mens naturalis aperta, et haec mens absque luce spirituali non videt aliter.
