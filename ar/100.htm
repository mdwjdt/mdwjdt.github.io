<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第100节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>100.“叫你们被试炼”表利用虚假和他们争战。之所以有这样的含义，是因为属灵的试探就是魔鬼与主为占据人而争战。魔鬼或地狱把他的虚假引出来，并予以指责和定罪。而主却将真理引出来，将人引离虚假，把他解救出来。显现给人，如同在他自己里面的，正是这种争战，因为争战来自与他同在的恶灵，被称为“试探”。我从亲身经历得知，属灵的试探不是别的。因为我在试探中曾看到引发试探的魔鬼，还看到从解救我的主那里来的流注。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 100</h4><p>100. "'That you may be tested.'" This symbolically means, through falsities assailing them.<p>This is the symbolic meaning because every spiritual temptation or trial is a combat between the devil and the Lord as to who will possess the person. The devil or hell puts forth its falsities so as to reproach and condemn, while the Lord puts forth truths by which to lead away from falsities and liberate.<p>This combat is one that appears to a person to take place in him, because it is caused by evil spirits with him, and it is called a temptation or trial. I know from experience that this is what a spiritual temptation is, because in my temptations I have seen the infernal spirits who induced them and have perceived the influx from the Lord that delivered me from them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 100</h4><p>100. 'That you may be put to the test' signifies a fighting against them by means of untruths. This is signified because every spiritual temptation is a combat of the devil and the Lord [as to] who shall take possession of a man. The devil or hell brings out his untruths, and rebukes and condemns, but the Lord brings out truths and leads away out of untruths and deliverse This is a combat that appears to the man as in him, because it is from the evil spirits who are with him; and it is called temptation. I know from experience that spiritual temptation is nothing else, because in my temptations I have seen the infernals who induced them and have seen the influx from the Lord Who delivered me. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 100</h4><p>100. That ye may be tried, signifies by falsities fighting against them. The reason why this is signified is, because all spiritual temptation is a combat of the devil and the Lord, which shall have possession of man. The devil or hell brings out his falsities, and reproaches and condemns him; but the Lord brings out his truths, and withdraws him from falsities, and delivers him. It is this combat which appears to man as in himself, because it is from evil spirits who are with him, and is called temptation. That spiritual temptation is nothing else, I know from experience, because in my temptations I have seen the infernals who induced them, and have perceived the influx from the Lord, who liberated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 100 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>100. "Ut <sup>1</sup>tentemini" significat per falsa pugnantia contra illos. - Quod hoc significetur, est quia omnis tentatio spiritualis est pugna diaboli ac Domini, quis illum possidebit; diabolus seu infernum expromit falsa ejus, ac increpat et condemnat; Dominus autem vera, et e falsis abducit et liberat. Haec pugna est, quae apparet homini sicut in illo, quia est ex spiritibus malis qui apud illum, et vocatur Tentatio. Quod tentatio Spiritualis non aliud sit, ab experientia scio, quia in tentationibus meis vidi infernales qui induxerunt, et percepi influxum a Domino Qui liberavit.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Ut pro "Et" </p>
