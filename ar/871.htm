<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第871节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>871.“他们都照各人所行的受审判”表他们全都照其外在里面的内在生命受审判，这一点从前面的解释（<a href="868.htm">868</a>节）明显可知，那里有相同的话。</p><p>表所有人都照其外在里面的内在生命受审判。对此，我补充一点：每个人都照自己灵魂的性质受审判；人的灵魂就是他的生命，因为灵魂是其意愿之爱，每个人的意愿之爱完全取决于他对从主发出的神性真理的接受；出于圣言的教会教义则指导这种接受。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 871</h4><p>871. And they were judged, each one according to his works. This symbolically means that all were judged in accordance with the inner life in their outward appearances.<p>This is apparent from the explanation above in no. <a href="868.htm">868</a>, where similar words occur. To which I will add this, that everyone is judged in accordance with the character of his soul, and a person's soul is his life. For it is his will's love, and the will's love in everyone accords completely with his reception of the Divine truth emanating from the Lord. The doctrine of the church that is drawn from the Word teaches this reception. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 871</h4><p>871. That 'And they were judged, each one, according to their works' signifies that they were all judged in accordance with their internal life in external things is plain from the things expounded above (<a href="868.htm">868</a>) where the words are similar. To which things I will add this, that every one is judged in accordance with the quality of his soul, and a man's soul is his life, for it is the love of his will, and the love of every one's will is entirely in accordance with the reception of the Divine Truths proceeding from the Lord, and the Church's doctrine that is out of the Word teaches this reception. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 871</h4><p>871. And they were judged everyone according to their works, signifies that they were all judged according to their internal life in externals, as appears from the explanation above, (<a href="868.htm">868</a>), where are similar words. To which I will add this, that everyone is judged according to the quality of his soul; and the soul of man is his life, for it is the love of his will, and the love of everyone's will is entirely according to his reception of the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; and this reception is taught by the doctrine of the church which is from the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 871 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>871. "Et judicati sunt quisque secundum opera illorum." - Quod significet quod omnes judicati sint secundum vitam suam in internam in externis, patet ab explicatis supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_871/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_868" target=_top>868</a>), ubi similia verba: quibus haec adjiciam, quod quisque judicetur secundum quale suae animae; et anima hominis est vita ejus, est enim amor voluntatis ejus; et amor voluntatis cujusvis est prorsus secundum receptionem Divini Veri procedentis a Domino, et hanc receptionem docet doctrina Ecclesiae quae ex Verbo est. </p>
