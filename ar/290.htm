<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第290节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>290.“我又听见在天上、地上、地底下和洋海里一切被造之物，以及天地间的万有，都说”表最低层天堂的天使对主的称谢和颂赞。从这一系列明显可知，这是最低层天堂的天使对主的称谢和颂赞，因为之前对主的称谢和颂赞出于高层和低层天堂（<a href="275.htm">275</a>节等，以及<a href="286.htm">286</a>节等）。天堂分为三层，每一层都有无数社群，每层社群都被称为一个天堂。显然，“在天上、地上、地底下和洋海里一切被造之物”表示天使，因为经上说“我听见说”，以及他们说“但愿祝福、尊贵、荣耀、权能都归给坐宝座的和羔羊，世世无穷”。</p><p>他们被称为“被造之物”，这符合圣言的风格。在圣言中，一切被造之物，包括动物界和植物界的一切被造之物，都表示人所具有的各种事物，总体上表示诸如属于其意愿或情感，以及属于其认知或思维的那类事物。它们之所以表示这类事物，是因为它们与这类事物相对应。圣言纯以对应写成，故类似事物论及天上的天堂和教会的世人。为证明这一点，我仅引用如下少量经文：</p><p>耶稣对门徒说，你们往全世界去，传福音给一切受造物。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可16.15.htm">16:15</a>）</p><p>你且问走兽，走兽必指教你；又问空中的飞鸟，飞鸟必告诉你；或对地上的灌木说话，灌木必指教你，海中的鱼也必向你说明；从这一切，谁不知道是耶和华的手做成的呢？（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯12.7.htm">12:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯12.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>愿天和地，海洋和海中爬行的一切都赞美耶和华，因为神要拯救锡安。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.34.htm">69:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.35.htm">35</a>）</p><p>鲸鱼和一切深海，你们要从地上赞美耶和华。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.7.htm">148:7</a>）</p><p>我必把万物从地上完全除灭，我必除灭人类和牲畜，除灭空中的飞鸟和海里的鱼。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.2.htm">1:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.3.htm">3</a>；又如以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛50.2.htm">50:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛50.3.htm">3</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.19.htm">38:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.20.htm">20</a>；何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.2.htm">4:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.3.htm">3</a>；启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.7.htm">8:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>愿天欢喜，愿地快乐；愿海和海中充满的，都翻腾；愿田野和其中的一切都欢乐，那时林中的一切树木都必在耶和华面前歌唱，因为祂来了；祂来要审判全地。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗96.11.htm">96:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗96.13.htm">13</a>等）</p><p>经上所说的“一切受造物”表示一切被改造之物，或被改造的所有人，因为“创造”表示改造和重生（<a href="254.htm">254</a>节）。至于“天上、地上、地底下”的含义，可参看<a href="260.htm">260</a>节；“海”的含义，可参看<a href="238.htm">238</a>节。由此明显可知“海里的那类事物和其中的一切”表示什么。在圣言中，“海里的鱼”就表示这些事物，也就是感官情感，这些最属世人的最底层。在灵界，这类情感从远处看，就像“鱼”，仿佛在“海里”。因为他们所在的大气看似含水，故在灵界，在那些住在天上和地上的看来，好像是一片“海”。对此，可参看前文（<a href="238.htm">238</a>节），关于“鱼”（<a href="405.htm">405</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 290</h4><p>290. And every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying. (<a href="3927/revelation_5_13.htm">5:13</a>) This symbolizes a confession and glorification of the Lord by angels of the lowest heavens.<p>That it is a confession and glorification of the Lord by angels of the lowest heavens is apparent from the series, because the preceding confessions and glorifications of the Lord were made by angels of the higher and lower heavens (nos. <a href="275.htm">275</a>ff., <a href="286.htm">286</a>ff.). For there are three heavens, and in each countless societies, every one of which is called a heaven.<p>It is apparent that angels are meant by every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and in the sea, for we are told, "I heard (them) saying," and they said "Blessing and honor and glory and strength be to Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever!"</p><p>[2] Their being called created things accords with the style of the Word, in which all created things, both those of the animal kingdom and those of the plant kingdom, symbolize various constituents in a person - in general constituents having to do with his will or affection, and constituents having to do with his intellect or thought. They have symbolic meanings because they are correspondent forms. And because the Word was written solely in terms of things that correspond, similar things are therefore said in it about angels in heaven and people of the church. To confirm this we will cite just a few passages, as the following:<p>(Jesus) said (to the disciples,) "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature." (<a href="3927/mark_16_15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>)<p>But now ask the beasts, and they will teach you; and the birds of the air, and they will tell you; or... the vegetation of the earth, and they will teach you; and the fish of the sea will recount to you. Who among all these does not know that the hand of Jehovah has done this... (<a href="3927/job_12_7.htm">Job 12:7-9</a>)<p>Let heaven and earth praise (Jehovah), the seas and everything that moves in them. For God will save Zion... (<a href="3927/psalms_69_34.htm">Psalms 69:34-35</a>)<p>Praise Jehovah from the earth, you whales and all the depths. (<a href="3927/psalms_148_7.htm">Psalms 148:7</a>)<p>I will utterly consume everything from the face of the earth...; I will consume man and beast; I will consume the birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea. (<a href="3927/zephaniah_1_2.htm">Zephaniah 1:2-3</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_8_7.htm">Revelation 8:7-9</a>)<p>The heavens will be glad, the earth will rejoice, the sea will pitch and roll, and all its fullness; the field will exult, and all that is in it. Then all the trees of the forest will sing before Jehovah. For He is coming, coming to judge the earth. (<a href="3927/psalms_96_11.htm">Psalms 96:11-13</a>)<p>And so on in many other places.</p><p>[3] The text says, "every created thing," and the meaning is every reformed thing, or all reformed people. For to create means, symbolically, to reform and regenerate (no. <a href="254.htm">254</a>).<p>To be shown the meaning of "in heaven," "on the earth," and "under the earth," see no. <a href="260.htm">260</a> above. And for the meaning of the sea, no. <a href="238.htm">238</a>. It is apparent from this what is symbolically meant by "such as are in the sea, and all that are in them." Such things as are in the Word are meant by the fish of the sea, and these are sensual affections, which are the lowest affections of the natural self. For in the spiritual world people's affections look at a distance like fish, and as being in a sea, because the atmosphere in which they exist appears as though made of water, and thus as a sea, in the eyes of the inhabitants who dwell in the heavens and on the earth there, as may be seen in no. <a href="238.htm">238</a> above, and as regards fish, in no. <a href="405.htm">405</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 290</h4><p>290. [verse 13] 'And every created thing that is in heaven and in the land, and under the land, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying' signifies a confession and glorification of the Lord by the angels of the lowest heavens. It is plain from the series that this confession and glorification of the Lord is by the angels of the lowest heavens, because the confessions and glorifications that precede were made by the angels of the higher and the lower heavens (<a href="275.htm">275</a> seq., <a href="286.htm">286</a> seq).; for there are three heavens and innumerable communities in each, any of which is called a heaven. That by 'every created thing, that is in heaven, and in and under the land, and in the sea' angels are understood is plain, for it says, 'heard I saying,' and they said, 'To the One sitting upon the throne and to the Lamb, blessing and honour and glory and strength for ages of ages.'</p><p>[2] That they are said to be 'created' is in accordance with the style of the Word, in which, by all the things created, both those that are of the animal kingdom and those that are of the vegetable kingdom, are signified the various things with a man, in general those that are of the will or affection, and those that are of the understanding or thought. They signify because they correspond. And because the Word has been composed by means of pure correspondences similar things are said there of the angels of heaven and the men of the Church. To confirm this, a few passages only shall be adduced, and these are:<p>Jesus said to the disciples, Going into all the world, preach the gospel to every creature, <a href="3927/mark_16_15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>.<p>Pray ask the beasts, and they shall teach; and the birds of heaven, and they shall make known to thee; or the shrub of the land, and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall tell unto thee. Who does not know from all these, that the hand of Jehovah has done this? <a href="3927/job_12_7.htm">Job 12:7-10</a>.<p>Let heaven and the land praise Jehovah, the seas and everything that creeps therein, for God will save Zion. <a href="3927/psalms_69_34.htm">Psalms 69:34-35</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_69_35.htm">35-36</a>].<p>Praise Jehovah from the land, O whales and all deeps. <a href="3927/psalms_148_7.htm">Psalms 148:7</a>.<p>Consuming, I will consume all things from upon the faces of the land, I will consume man and beast, I will consume the birds of the heavens and the fishes of the sea, <a href="3927/zephaniah_2_3.htm">Zephaniah 2:3</a> (likewise, <a href="3927/isaiah_1_2.htm">Isaiah 1:2-3</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_38_19.htm">Ezekiel 38:19-20</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_4_2.htm">Hosea 4:2-3</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_8_7.htm">Revelation 8:7-9</a>).<p>The heavens shall rejoice, the land shall be glad, the sea shall shake itself and the fullness thereof, the field shall exult and everything that is therein, then shall all the trees of the wood sing before Jehovah; for He is coming, for He is coming to judge the land. <a href="3927/psalms_96_11.htm">Psalms 96:11-13</a>; and in many other places.</p><p>[3] It is said 'every created thing,' and by this is understood every reformed thing, or all the reformed, for by 'to create' is signified to reform and regenerate (<a href="254.htm">254</a>). What is understood by 'in heaven,' 'upon the land,' and 'under the land,' may be seen above (<a href="260.htm">260</a>); and what by 'sea' (<a href="238.htm">238</a>); from which it is plain what is signified by 'such as are in the sea and all that are in them.' These are the things that are understood in the Word by 'the fishes of the sea,' which are the sensual affections that are the lowest of the natural man; for the affections of such people appear in the spiritual world from afar off as fishes, and as if in the sea, because the atmospheres in which they are appear as watery, and consequently as a sea in the eyes of those who are in the heavens and upon the lands there, [as] may be seen above (<a href="238.htm">238</a>), and concerning fishes (<a href="405.htm">405</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 290</h4><p>290. Verse 13. And every created thing which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, signifies confession and glorification of the Lord by the angels of the lowest heavens. That this is a confession and glorification of the Lord by the angels of the lowest heavens is evident from the series, because the confessions and glorifications of the Lord which precede were made by the angels of the higher and lower heavens, (<a href="275.htm">275</a>, and following numbers, <a href="286.htm">286</a>, and following numbers); for there are three heavens, and innumerable societies in each, and each of them is called a heaven. That by "every created thing which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and in the sea," are meant angels, is evident, for it says, "heard I saying," and they said, "Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb for ages of ages."</p><p>[2] Their being called "created thing" is according to the style of the Word, in which, by all created things, as well those which belong to the animal kingdom as those which belong to the vegetable kingdom, are signified various things with man, in general such things as belong to his will or affection, and such as pertain to his understanding or thought; for they signify such things, because they correspond to them. And since the Word is written by mere correspondences, similar things are said of the angels of heaven and the men of the church; in proof of which a few passages only shall be adduced, which are as follows:<p>Jesus said to His disciples, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature, (<a href="3927/mark_16_15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>).<p>Ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the birds of heaven and they shall tell thee; or the shrub of the earth, and it shall teach thee, and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee; who knoweth not from all these, that the hand of Jehovah hath done this? (<a href="3927/job_12_7.htm">Job 12:7-9</a>).<p>Let the heaven and earth praise Jehovah, the seas, and all that creepeth therein, for God will save Zion, (<a href="3927/psalms_69_34.htm">Psalms 69:34-35</a>).<p>Praise Jehovah from the earth, ye whales and all deeps, (<a href="3927/psalms_148_7.htm">Psalms 148:7</a>).<p>I will utterly consume all things from upon the face of the earth, I will consume man and beast, I will consume the birds of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea, (<a href="3927/zephaniah_1_2.htm">Zephaniah 1:2-3</a>; likewise in <a href="3927/isaiah_50_2.htm">Isaiah 50:2-3</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_38_19.htm">Ezekiel 38:19-20</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_4_2.htm">Hosea 4:2-3</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_8_7.htm">Revelation 8:7-9</a>).<p>The heavens shall be glad, and the earth shall rejoice; the sea shall be moved, and the fullness thereof; the field shall exult, and all that is therein; then shall all the trees of the wood sing before Jehovah, for He cometh; for He cometh to judge the earth, (<a href="3927/psalms_96_11.htm">Psalms 96:11-13</a> and in many other places).</p><p>[3] It is said "every created thing," by which is meant every reformed thing, or all the reformed, for "to create" signifies to reform and regenerate, (<a href="254.htm">254</a>). What is meant by "in heaven, upon the earth, and under the earth," may be seen above, (<a href="260.htm">260</a>); and what by the "sea" (<a href="238.htm">238</a>[1-5]); hence it is evident what is signified by "such things as are in the sea, and all that are in them;" these things are meant in the Word by "the fishes of the sea," which are the sensual affections, these being the lowest of the natural man, for in the spiritual world such affections appear at a distance like "fishes," and as if they were "in the sea," because the atmosphere in which they are, appears watery, and therefore to those who are in the heavens and on the earth there, it seems like "a sea," as may be seen above, (<a href="238.htm">238</a>[1-5]), and concerning fishes, (<a href="405.htm">405</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 290 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>290. (Vers. 13.) "Et omne creatum, quod est in Caelo, et in terra, et sub terra; et in mari quae sunt, et quae in illis omnia; audivi dicentes," significat confessionem et glorificationem Domini ab Angelis infimorum Caelorum. - Quod haec confessio et glorificatio Domini ab Angelis infimorum Caelorum sit, patet ex serie, quia confessiones et glorificationes Domini, quae praecedunt, factae sunt ab angelis superiorum Caelorum, et inferiorum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_290/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_275" target=_top>275</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_290/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_286" target=_top>286</a>, seq.); sunt enim tres Caeli, et in unoquovis innumerae Societates, quarum quaelibet vocatur Caelum. Quod per "omne creatum, quod est in Caelo, et in terra, et sub terra, et in mari," intelligantur Angeli, patet, nam dicitur. <sup>1</sup>"Audivi dicentes;" et dixerunt, "Sedenti super Throno et Agno, benedictio et honor et gloria et robur in saecula saeculorum." Quod dicantur "creatum" est secundum stylum Verbi, in quo per omnia creata, tam quae Regni animalis sunt quam quae Regni vegetabilis, significantur varia apud hominem, in genere quae ejus voluntatis seu affectionis sunt, et quae ejus intellectus seu cogitationis; quod significent est quia correspondent: et quia Verbum per meras Correspondentias est conscriptum, ideo ibi de Angelis Caeli et de hominibus Ecclesiae similia dicuntur; ad quod confirmandum solum pauca loca adducentur, quae sint: <p>"Jesus dixit Discipulis, Euntes in universum mundum praedicate Evangelium omni Creaturae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_290/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_16_15" target=_top>Marcus 16:15</a>);<p>"Quaere quaeso Bestias et docebunt, et Aves Caeli et annuntiabunt tibi, aut Virgultum terrae et docebit <sup>2</sup>te, et narrabunt tibi Pisces maris: quis non novit ex his omnibus, quod manus Jehovae fecerit illud," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_290/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_job_12_7-9" target=_top>Hiob 12:7-9</a>); <sup>3</sup><p>"Laudent Jehovam Caelum et Terra, Maria et omne repens in illis, quia Deus salvabit Sionem," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_290/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_69_35-36" target=_top>Psalm 69:35-36</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_290/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_69_34-35" target=_top>34-35</a>));<p>"Laudate Jehovam e terra, Balaenae et omnes abyssi," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_290/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_148_7" target=_top>Psalm 148:7</a>);<p>Consumendo consumam omnia desuper faciebus terrae, consumam Hominem et Bestiam, consumam Aves Caelorum et Pisces maris," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_290/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zephaniah_1_2-3" target=_top>Zephanias 1:2-3</a>).<p>(Similiter <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_290/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_1_2-3" target=_top>Esaias 1:2-3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_290/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_38_19-20" target=_top>Ezechiel 38:19-20</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_290/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_hosea_4_2-3" target=_top>Hoschea 4:2-3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_290/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_8_7-9" target=_top>Apocalypsis 8:7-9</a>) <p>"Laetabuntur Caeli, gaudebit Terra, commovebit se Mare et plenitudo ejus, exultabit Ager et omne quod in illo; tunc cantabunt omnes Arbores sylvae coram Jehovah, quia venit; quia venit ad judicandum terram," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_290/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_96_11-13" target=_top>Psalm 96:11-13</a>).<p>(Et in multis aliis locis.) <p>Dicitur "omne creatum," et per id intelligitur omne reformatum, seu omnes reformati, per "creare" enim significatur reformare et regenerare (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_290/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_254" target=_top>254</a>).
