<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第151节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>151.“我又要把晨星赐给他”表那时的聪明和智慧。“星”表对良善与真理的认知（参看<a href="51.htm">51</a>节），因为通过它们才会有聪明和智慧，故“晨星”表聪明和智慧。之所以称为“晨星”，是因为主来建立新教会，即新耶路撒冷时，要将聪明和智慧赐给他们。祂说：你们已经有的，总要持守，直等到我来。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.25.htm">2:25</a>）</p><p>这句话表示他们必须持守从圣言所知有关仁与信的少许真理，并照之生活，直到新天堂和新教会形成，也就是主来（<a href="145.htm">145</a>节）。</p><p>之所以称为“晨星”，还因为“早晨”表主的到来，这时会有一个新教会。这是圣言中“早晨”的含义，这一点从以下经文明显可知：</p><p>要到二千三百个晚上和早晨；然后圣所才是正当的；晚上和早晨的异象是真的。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.14.htm">8:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.26.htm">26</a>）</p><p>有人从西珥呼问我说，守望者啊，守望者，夜里如何？守望者说，早晨将到，黑夜也来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.11.htm">21:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>“晚上”和“夜里”表旧教会的末期，“早晨”表新教会的初期。</p><p>这地的居民哪，结局来了，早晨临到你；看哪，日子快到了，早晨已经发出。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结7.6.htm">7:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结7.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结7.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>耶和华在早晨，每早晨在光中赐下公义，从不间断。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番3.5.htm">3:5</a>）</p><p>神在她中间，早晨来临到，神必帮助她。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗46.5.htm">46:5</a>）</p><p>我等候耶和华；我的灵魂等候主，胜于守夜的等候天亮，胜于守夜的等候天亮；祂有丰盛的救恩，必救赎以色列。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗130.5.htm">130:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗130.8.htm">8</a>等）</p><p>在这些经文中，“早晨”（或天亮）表主的到来，就是祂降临世间，建立新教会的时候；如今也一样。由于唯独主赐给那些将属祂新教会之人聪明和智慧，并且主所赐的一切事物就是祂自己，故主说祂自己就是“晨星”：</p><p>我是大卫的根和后裔，是明亮的晨星。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.16.htm">22:16</a>）</p><p>在撒母耳记，祂也被称为“早晨”：</p><p>以色列的神，以色列的磐石、晓谕我说，祂必像晨光、如无云的清晨。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下23.3.htm">23:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下23.4.htm">4</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 151</h4><p>151. "'And I will give him the morning star.'" (<a href="3927/revelation_2_28.htm">2:28</a>) This symbolizes intelligence and wisdom then.<p>Stars symbolize concepts of goodness and truth, as may be seen in no <a href="51.htm">51</a> above; and because concepts of goodness and truth are the means to intelligence and wisdom, therefore these concepts are symbolically meant by the morning star. It is called the morning star, because the people meant here will be given intelligence and wisdom by the Lord when He comes to establish the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem; for He says, "Hold fast what you have till I come" (verse 25), which symbolically means, "so that they may retain the few truths that they know from the Word about charity and its resulting faith, and live according to them, until the New Heaven and New Church are formed, which are the Lord's advent" (no. <a href="145.htm">145</a>).</p><p>[2] It is called the morning star because the morning symbolizes the Lord's advent, when the New Church is formed. That this is the meaning of the morning in the Word is apparent from the following passages:<p>Till the two thousand three hundredth evening and morning, then the sanctuary shall be made right... The vision of the evening and the morning... is the truth. (<a href="3927/daniel_8_14.htm">Daniel 8:14</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_8_26.htm">26</a>)<p>One is calling to me from Seir, "Watchman..., watchman, what of the night?" The watchman said, "The morning comes, and also the night. (<a href="3927/isaiah_21_11.htm">Isaiah 21:11-12</a>)<p>Evening and night symbolize the final period of the old church, and morning the initial period of a new church.<p>An end has come... The morning has come upon you, you who dwell in the land... Behold, the day... has come! The morning has gone forth. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_7_6.htm">Ezekiel 7:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_7_10.htm">10</a>)<p>Jehovah... every morning will bring His judgment to light, and it shall not be lacking. (<a href="3927/zephaniah_3_5.htm">Zephaniah 3:5</a>)<p>God is in the midst of her...; God shall help her when He beholds the morning. (<a href="3927/psalms_46_5.htm">Psalms 46:5</a>)<p>I have waited for Jehovah... My soul waits for the Lord more than those who watch for the morning, [indeed] than those who watch for the morning... For... with Him is abundant redemption, and He shall redeem Israel... (<a href="3927/psalms_130_5.htm">Psalms 130:5-8</a>)</p><p>[3] And elsewhere. Morning in these passages means the Lord's advent, when He came into the world and established a new church, and likewise now. Moreover, because the Lord alone imparts intelligence and wisdom to the people who will be people of His New Church, and as everything that the Lord imparts embody Him because they are His, therefore the Lord says that He is the morning star:<p>I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star. (<a href="3927/revelation_22_16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>)<p>He is also called the morning in 2 Samuel:<p>The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me: .".. He is as the light of the morning..., a morning without clouds...." (<a href="3927/2-samuel_23_3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3-4</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 151</h4><p>151. [verse 28] 'And I will give him the morning star' signifies intelligence and wisdom then. That cognitions of good and truth are signified by 'stars' may be seen above (<a href="51.htm">51</a>); and because by means of them there is intelligence and wisdom, therefore these cognitions are signified by 'the morning star.' 'Morning star' <sup>1</sup>is said because intelligence and wisdom will be given by the Lord when He comes for the setting up of the New Church that is the New Jerusalem, for He says, 'What you have, hold fast till I come' (verse 25), by which is signified so that they may retain the few truths that they know about charity and the faith therefrom out of the Word, and live in accordance with them, even till the New Heaven and the New Church, which are the Lord's coming, are brought into being (<a href="145.htm">145</a>).</p><p>[2] 'Morning star' is said, because by 'morning' or 'dawn' is signified the Lord's coming, when there is a New Church. That this is understood by 'morning' in the Word is plain from the following passages:<p>Until the evening and the morning two thousand three hundred; then shall the sanctuary be justified; the vision of the evening and the morning, is truth. <a href="3927/daniel_8_14.htm">Daniel 8:14</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_8_26.htm">26</a>.<p>Calling to me out of Seir, Watchman, watchman, what of the night? The watchman said, The morning comes, and also the night. <a href="3927/isaiah_21_11.htm">Isaiah 21:11-12</a>.<p>By 'evening' and 'night' is signified the last time of an old Church, and by 'morning' the first time of a new Church.<p>The end is come, the morning is come upon thee, O inhabitant of the land; behold the day is come, the morning is gone forth. <a href="3927/ezekiel_7_6.htm">Ezekiel 7:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_7_10.htm">10</a>.<p>Jehovah in the morning, in the morning He will give His judgment into the light, and will not be absent, <a href="3927/zephaniah_3_5.htm">Zephaniah 3:5</a>.<p>God is in the midst of her, God shall help her when morning appears. <a href="3927/psalms_46_5.htm">Psalms 46:5</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_46_6.htm">6</a>].<p>I have waited for Jehovah, my soul waits for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning, they that watch for the morning, for with Him is plenteous redemption, and He shall redeem Israel. <a href="3927/psalms_130_5.htm">Psalms 130:5-8</a>; and elsewhere.</p><p>[3] By 'morning' in these passages is understood the Lord's coming, when He came into the world and set up a new Church. In like manner now. And because the Only Lord gives those who will be of His New Church (e Nova Ipsius Ecclesia) intelligence and wisdom, and all things that the Lord gives are Himself because they are His, therefore the Lord says that He is 'the morning Star':<p>I am the root and offspring of David, the bright and the morning Star. <a href="3927/revelation_22_16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>.<p>He is also called 'the morning' in 2 Samuel:<p>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He is as the light of the morning, a morning without clouds, <a href="3927/2-samuel_23_3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3-4</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In view of the repetition of this phrase later in the paragraph, it seems probable that the exposition here applies to the phrase 'And I will give.' </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 151</h4><p>151. Verse 28. And I will give him the morning star, signifies intelligence and wisdom then. That by "stars" are signified the knowledges of good and truth, may be seen above, (<a href="51.htm">51</a>); and because by them is intelligence and wisdom, therefore these are signified by "the morning star." It is called "the morning star" because intelligence and wisdom will be given them by the Lord, when He shall come to establish the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem; for He says:<p>That which ye have, hold fast till I come, (<a href="3927/revelation_2_25.htm">Revelation 2:25</a>).<p>By which is signified, that they must retain the few truths which they know concerning charity and its faith from the Word, and live according to them, even until the New Heaven and the New Church are formed, which is the Coming of the Lord, (<a href="145.htm">145</a>).</p><p>[2] It is called "the morning star" because by "morning" is signified the Coming of the Lord, when there is a New Church. That this is meant by "morning" in the Word, appears from the following passages:<p>Until the evening and morning two thousand three hundred; then shall the sanctuary be justified; the vision of the evening and morning is truth, (<a href="3927/daniel_8_14.htm">Daniel 8:14</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_8_26.htm">26</a>).<p>He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, watchman, what of the night? The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night, (<a href="3927/isaiah_21_11.htm">Isaiah 21:11-12</a>).<p>By "the evening" and "the night" is signified the last time of the old church, and by "the morning" the first time of the New Church.<p>The end is come, the morning is come upon thee, O thou inhabitant of the earth; behold the day it is come, the morning hath gone forth, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_7_6.htm">Ezekiel 7:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_7_10.htm">10</a>).<p>Jehovah in the morning, in the morning He will give His judgment in light, He faileth not, (<a href="3927/zephaniah_3_5.htm">Zephaniah 3:5</a>).<p>God is in the midst of her, God shall help her when the morning appeareth, (<a href="3927/psalms_46_5.htm">Psalms 46:5</a>).<p>I have waited for Jehovah; my soul doth wait for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning, that watch for the morning; for with Him is plenteous redemption, and He shall redeem Israel, (<a href="3927/psalms_130_5.htm">Psalms 130:5-8</a> and other places).</p><p>[3] By "morning" in these passages is meant the Lord's Coming, when He came into the world and established a New Church; in like manner now. And because the Lord alone gives those who will be of His New Church intelligence and wisdom; and all things which the Lord gives are Himself because they are of Himself, therefore the Lord says that He Himself is "the morning star":<p>I am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star, (<a href="3927/revelation_22_16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>).<p>He is called also "the morning" in 2 Samuel:<p>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He is as the light of the morning, a morning without clouds, (<a href="3927/2-samuel_23_3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3-4</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 151 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>151. (Vers. 28.) "Et dabo illi stellam matutinam," significat intelligentiam et sapientiam tunc. - Quod per "stellas" significentur cognitiones boni et veri, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_151/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_51" target=_top>51</a>); et quia per illas est intelligenti a et sapientia, ideo hae per "stellam matutinam" significantur. Quod dicatur "stella matutina," est quia intelligenti a et sapientia illis a Domino dabitur, cum venturus est ad instaurandum Novam Ecclesiam, quae est Nova Hierosolyma; nam dicit, "Quod habetis, retinete donec venio," (vers. 25), per quae significatur, ut retineant pauca illa vera quae sciunt de charitate et ejus fide ex Verbo, et secundum illa vivant, usque dum fit Novum Caelum et Nova Ecclesia, quae sunt Adventus Domini (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_151/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_145" target=_top>145</a>). Quod dicatur "stella matutina," est quia per "matutinum" seu mane significatur Adventus Domini, quando Nova Ecclesia: quod hoc intelligatur per "Mane" in Verbo, patet a sequentibus locis: <p>"Usque ad Vesperam et Mane bis mille trecenta; tunc justificabitur Sanctum: visio Vesperae et Mane, veritas est," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_151/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_8_14" target=_top>Daniel 8:14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_151/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_8_26" target=_top>26</a>);<p>"Ad me clamans e Seir, custos, custos, quid de nocte; dixit custos, venit Mane, etiamque nox," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_151/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_21_11-12" target=_top>Esaias 21:11-12</a>);<p>per "Vesperam" et "Noctem" significatur ultimum tempus Ecclesiae veteris, et per "Mane" primum tempus Ecclesiae novae. <p>"Venit finis, venit Mane super te, habitator terrae; ecce dies venit, exivit Mane," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_151/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_7_6-7" target=_top>Ezechiel 7:6-7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_151/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_7_10" target=_top>10</a>);<p>"Jehovah in Mane, in Mane judicium Suum dabit in lucem, nec deerit," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_151/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zephaniah_3_5" target=_top>Zephanias 3:5</a>);<p>"Deus in medio ejus, adjuvabit eam Deus cum spectat Mane," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_151/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_46_6" target=_top>Psalm 46:6</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_151/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_46_5" target=_top>5</a>));<p>"Exspectavi Jehovam; exspectat anima mea Dominum a custodientibus Mane; custodientes Mane, quia plurima cum Ipso redemptio, et Ille redimet Israelem," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_151/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_130_5-8" target=_top>Psalm 130:5-8</a>); et alibi. <p>Per "Mane" in his locis intelligitur Adventus Domini, cum Ipse in mundum venit, et novam Ecclesiam instauravit; similiter nunc: et quia Solus Dominus dat illis, qui e Nova Ipsius Ecclesia erunt, intelligentiam et sapientiam, et omnia quae Dominus dat sunt Ipse quia sunt Ipsius, ideo dicit Dominus, quod Ipse sit "Stella matutina;" <p>"Ego sum Radix et Genus Davidis, Stella illa Splendida et Matutina," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_151/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_22_16" target=_top>Apocalypsis 22:16</a>);<p>vocatur etiam "Mane" in 2 Samuelis: <p>"Dixit Deus Israelis, mihi locuta est Petra Israelis, Ille sicut Lux Mane, Mane sine nubibus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_151/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-samuel_23_3-4" target=_top>23:3-4</a>). </p>
