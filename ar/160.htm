<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第160节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>160.“因我见你的行为，在神面前并不完全”表其敬拜的内在并未与结合。“行为”表内在与外在，“我知道你的行为”表主立刻洞悉人所有的内在与外在（参看<a href="76.htm">76</a>节）。当他们与主结合时，其行为就被称为“在神面前是完全的”。必须知道的是，死的敬拜，或只有外在的敬拜使主临在，却不会结合。而内在居于其中的外在敬拜既实现临在，也实现结合。因为主与人所具有的来自主的事物结合，也就是良善所产生的真理；若这些不在敬拜中，行为在神面前就不完全，而是空虚的。在圣言中，是指着只处于虚假与邪恶的人被说成是“空虚”的（如马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.44.htm">12:44</a>等）。因此，处于真理与良善的人被说成是“完全”的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 160</h4><p>160. "'For I have not found your works full before God.'" This symbolically means that the inner qualities of their worship are not conjoined with the Lord.<p>Works mean inner and outer qualities, and "I know your works" means that the Lord sees all a person's inner and outer qualities simultaneously, as may be seen in no. <a href="76.htm">76</a> above. They are called full before God when they have been conjoined with the Lord.<p>It should be known that lifeless worship or simply an outward expression of worship occasions the Lord's presence, but not conjunction. On the other hand, an outward expression of worship which has in it inner qualities that are living, occasions both presence and conjunction. For conjunction with the Lord is a conjunction with qualities in a person that come from the Lord, which are truths springing from goodness. Unless these truths are present in worship, a person's works are not full before God, but empty.<p>In the Word, emptiness is used to describe a person who has in him nothing but falsities and evils, as in <a href="3927/matthew_12_44.htm">Matthew 12:44</a>, <sup>1</sup>and elsewhere. Fullness, therefore, is used to describe a person who has in him truths and goods.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none. Then he says, "I will return to my house from which I came." And when he comes, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order. Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be with this wicked generation. (<a href="3927/matthew_12_43.htm">Matthew 12:43-45</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 160</h4><p>160. 'For I have not found thy works full before God' signifies that the interiors of their worship have not been conjoined with the Lord. That by 'works' the interiors and exteriors are understood, and that by 'I know thy works' [is signified] that the Lord sees all the interiors and exteriors of man at once, may be seen above (<a href="76.htm">76</a>). These works are called 'full before God' when they have been conjoined with the Lord. It should be known that dead worship or worship only external does effect the Lord's presence, but not conjunction. But external worship in which the interiors are living effects both presence and conjunction; for the conjunction of the Lord is with the things with a man that are from the Lord, which are the truths resulting from good, and unless these are in the worship, the works are not full before God, but are empty. 'Empty' in the Word is said of the man in whom there are purely and simply untruths and evils (as. <a href="3927/matthew_12_44.htm">Matthew 12:44</a>, and elsewhere). 'Full' is therefore said of the man in whom there are truths and goods. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 160</h4><p>160. For I have not found thy works full before God, signifies that the interiors of their worship are not conjoined with the Lord. That by "works" are meant the interiors and exteriors, and that by "I know thy works," is signified that the Lord sees all the interiors and exteriors of man at once, may be seen above, (<a href="76.htm">76</a>); which are called "full before God," when they are conjoined with the Lord. It must be known, that dead worship or worship which is only external, causes the Lord's presence, but not conjunction; but external worship, in which the interiors live, causes both presence and conjunction. For the conjunction of the Lord is with the things with man which are from the Lord, which are truths from good, and unless these are in worship, the works are not full before God, but are empty. A man is said to be "empty" in the Word, in whom there are nothing but falsities and evils (as in <a href="3927/matthew_12_44.htm">Matthew 12:44</a>, and in other places). Hence a man is said to be "full," in whom there are truths and goods. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 160 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>160. "Non enim inveni tua opera plena coram Deo," significat quod interiora cultus eorum non conjuncta sint Domino. - Quod per "opera" intelligantur interiora et exteriora, et quod per "Novi opera tua," quod Dominus videat omnia interiora et exteriora hominis simul, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_160/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_76" target=_top>76</a>); quae vocantur "plena coram Deo" quando conjuncta sunt Domino. Sciendum est, quod cultus mortuus seu cultus solummodo externus, faciat praesentiam Domini, sed non conjunctionem; at cultus externus, in quo interiora vivunt, facit et praesentiam et conjunctionem; nam conjunctio Domini est cum illis apud hominem quae a Domino sunt, quae sunt vera ex bono, quae nisi in cultu sunt, opera non sunt plena coram Deo, sed sunt vacua: "vacuum" in Verbo dicitur de homine, in quo mere sunt falsa et mala (ut <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_160/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_12_44" target=_top>Matthaeus 12:44</a>, et alibi); inde "plenum" dicitur de homine in quo vera et bona sunt. </p>
