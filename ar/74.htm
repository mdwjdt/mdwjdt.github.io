<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>74.“这些事是那右手拿着七星的说的”表示主，一切真理经由圣言来自祂。“右手拿着七星的”是指主，“右手拿着七星”是指圣言中良善与真理的一切认知，圣言因此来自主，与天堂天使并教会之人同在，可见上文（<a href="51.htm">51</a>节）。出于圣言的良善与真理的认知都是真理。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 74</h4><p>74. "'These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand.'" This symbolizes the Lord, the source of all truths by means of the Word.<p>It may be seen in no. <a href="51.htm">51</a> above that "He who holds the seven stars in His right hand" is the Lord, and that the seven stars in His right hand are all concepts of goodness and truth in the Word, which exist therefore from the Lord in angels in heaven and in people in the church. Concepts of goodness and truth from the Word are truths. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 74</h4><p>74. 'These things says He Who holds the seven stars in His right hand' signifies the Lord, from Whom by means of the Word are all truths. That 'He Who holds the seven stars in His right hand' is the Lord, and that 'the seven stars in His right hand' are all the cognitions of good and truth in the Word that are thence from the Lord with the angels of heaven and the men of the Church, may be seen above (<a href="51.htm">51</a>). Cognitions of good and truth out of the Word are truths. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 74</h4><p>74. These things saith He that holdeth the seven stars in His right hand, signifies the Lord, from whom through the Word are all truths. That "He that holdeth the seven stars in His right hand," is the Lord, and that "the seven stars in His right hand" are all the knowledges of good and truth in the Word, which are thence from the Lord, with the angels of heaven and the men of the church, may be seen above, (<a href="51.htm">51</a>). The knowledges of good and truth from the Word are truths. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 74 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>74. "Haec dicit Tenens septem stellas in dextra Sua," significat Dominum, a Quo per Verbum omnia vera sunt. - Quod "Tenens septem stellas in dextra Sua," sit Dominus, et quod "septem stellae in dextra manu Ipsius" sint omnes cognitiones boni et veri in Verbo, quae inde a Domino apud Angelos Caeli et apud homines Ecclesiae sunt, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_74/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_51" target=_top>51</a>); cognitiones boni et veri ex Verbo sunt vera. </p>
