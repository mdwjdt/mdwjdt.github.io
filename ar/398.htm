<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>398.启8:7.“第一位天使吹号”表审查并显示那些内在陷入唯信者当中的教会状态的品质。“吹号”表示审查并显示（<a href="397.htm">397</a>节）。“第一位天使吹号”之所以表示审查并显示那些内在陷入唯信者当中的教会状态，是因为吹号的行动在“地上”生效；第二位天使吹号的行动在海里生效；在整卷启示录，“地”与“海”一同被提及时，就表示整个教会；“地”表示由那些处于教会内在之人所构成的教会，“海”表示由那些处于教会外在之人所构成的教会；因为教会有内在和外在之分；神职人员在内在，平信徒在外在；或那些深入学习其教义，并通过圣言证实它们的人在内在，未如此行的人在外在。</p><p>在以下启示录经文中，“地”和“海”就表示这二者：</p><p>叫风不吹在地上、海上。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.1.htm">7:1</a>）</p><p>不可伤害地、海。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.3.htm">7:3</a>）</p><p>天使从天降下，右脚踏海，左脚踏地。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启10.2.htm">10:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启10.5.htm">10:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启10.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>我看见一个兽从海中上来，另有一个兽从地中上来。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.1.htm">13:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.11.htm">11</a>）</p><p>称颂那创造天、地、海的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.7.htm">14:7</a>）</p><p>第一位天使把碗倒在地上，第二位天使把碗倒在海里。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.2.htm">16:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.3.htm">3</a>）。</p><p>“地”和“海”表示教会的内在和外在，因而表示整个教会，因为在灵界，那些处于教会内在的人看上去住在干地上，而那些处于教会外在的人看上去则住在海里；不过，这些海只是源于他们所在的一般真理的表象。“地”表示教会（参看<a href="285.htm">285</a>节）；“世界”也是（<a href="551.htm">551</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 398</h4><p>398. The first angel sounded. (<a href="3927/revelation_8_7.htm">8:7</a>) This symbolizes an examination and exposure of the state of life and its character in people caught up interiorly in that faith.<p>To sound a trumpet means, symbolically, to examine and expose (no. <a href="397.htm">397</a>). The sounding of the first angel means an examination and exposure of the state of the church among people caught up interiorly in that faith, because it produced its effect on the earth, as said next, and the sounding of the second angel produced its effect on the sea; and throughout the book of Revelation, when both earth and sea are mentioned, the whole church is meant - the earth meaning the church composed of people concerned with its internal elements, and the sea meaning the church composed of people concerned with its external ones. For the church is internal and external - internal in the case of the clergy, external in the laity, or internal in the case of people who study its doctrines interiorly and defend them by the Word, and external in the case of people who do not do that.</p><p>[2] Both kinds of people are meant by the earth and the sea in the following places in the book of Revelation:<p>...that the wind should not blow on the earth, on the sea... (<a href="3927/revelation_7_1.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>)<p>Do not harm the earth or the sea... (<a href="3927/revelation_7_3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>)<p>(The angel coming down from heaven) set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the earth. (<a href="3927/revelation_10_2.htm">Revelation 10:2</a>, cf. <a href="3927/revelation_10_5.htm">10:5-6</a>)<p>I saw a beast rising up out of the sea... and another beast coming up out of the earth... (<a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_13_11.htm">11</a>)<p>Worship (God) who made heaven, the earth, and the sea... (<a href="3927/revelation_14_7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a>)<p>(The first angel) poured out his bowl upon the earth... Then the second angel poured out his... on the sea... (<a href="3927/revelation_16_2.htm">Revelation 16:2-3</a>)<p>Earth and sea symbolize the internal and external church, thus the whole church, because people in the spiritual world who are concerned with the internal elements of the church appear to live on dry land, while people who are concerned with its external elements are seemingly at sea, although the seas are appearances caused by the general truths which they possess.<p>To be shown that the earth symbolizes the church, see no. <a href="285.htm">285</a>. And that the world does, too, no. <a href="551.htm">551</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 398</h4><p>398. [verse 7] 'And the first angel sounded' signifies an examination and making manifest [to show] what the state of the Church is with those who are interiorly in that faith. By 'to sound' is signified to examine and make manifest (<a href="397.htm">397</a>). The reason why by the sounding of this first angel is understood an examination and making manifest [to show] the state of the Church with those who are interiorly in that faith is because its operation took place upon the land, as it follows on; and the operation of the second angel's sounding was into the sea, and by 'land' and 'sea' everywhere in the Apocalypse, when the two are named together, the entire Church is understood; by LAND the Church [formed] out of those who are in its internal things, and by SEA the Church [formed] out of those who are in the external things thereof. For the Church is internal and external, internal with the 'clergy,' external with the 'laity,' or internal with those who have studied the doctrinal things thereof interiorly and have confirmed them out of the Word, and external with those who have not done so.</p><p>[2] The latter and the former are those who are understood by 'land' and 'sea' in these places in the Apocalypse:<p>So that the wind should not blow upon the land, nor upon the sea. <a href="3927/revelation_7_1.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>.<p>Do no harm to land or sea. <a href="3927/revelation_7_3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>.<p>The angel coming down from heaven set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the land. <a href="3927/revelation_10_2.htm">Revelation 10:2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_10_8.htm">8</a>; also verse 6.<p>I saw a beast coming up Out of the sea, and another beast coming up out of the land. <a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_13_11.htm">11</a>.<p>Praise God Who made the heaven, the land and the sea. <a href="3927/revelation_14_7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a>.<p>The first angel poured out his phial upon the land, and the second angel poured his upon the sea. <a href="3927/revelation_16_2.htm">Revelation 16:2-3</a>.<p>By 'land and sea' is signified the Church internal and external, thus the entire Church. This is because in the spiritual world those who are in the internal things of the Church appear upon the dry lands, and those who are in its external things are as it were in the seas, but the seas are appearances originating out of the general truths in which they are. That 'land' signifies the Church, may be seen (<a href="285.htm">285</a>); and 'world' (orbis) does so also (<a href="551.htm">551</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 398</h4><p>398. Verse 7. And the first angel sounded, signifies exploration and manifestation of the quality of the state of the church with those who are interiorly in that faith. By "sounding" is signified to explore and make manifest, (<a href="397.htm">397</a>). The reason why by "the sounding of this first angel," is meant the exploration and manifestation of the state of the church with those who are interiorly in that faith, is, because its operation was directed upon "the earth," as appears from what follows; and the operation of the sounding of the second angel was into "the sea," and by "the earth and the sea," throughout Revelation, when named together, is meant the entire church; by "the earth," the church consisting of those who are in its internals, and by "the sea," the church consisting of those who are in its externals: for the church is internal and external; internal with the clergy, and external with the laity; or internal with those who have studied its doctrinals interiorly, and have confirmed them from the Word, and external with those who have not.</p><p>[2] Both are meant by "the earth and the sea" in the following passages in Revelation:<p>That the wind should not blow upon the earth, nor on the sea, (<a href="3927/revelation_7_1.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>).<p>Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, (<a href="3927/revelation_7_3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>).<p>The angel descending out of heaven set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth, (<a href="3927/revelation_10_2.htm">Revelation 10:2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_10_8.htm">8</a>; also in <a href="3927/revelation_10_5.htm">Revelation 10:5</a>).<p>I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, and another beast coming up out of the earth, (<a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_13_11.htm">11</a>).<p>Praise God who made the heaven, the earth, and the sea, (<a href="3927/revelation_14_7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a>).<p>The first angel poured out his vial upon the earth, and the second angel his upon the sea, (<a href="3927/revelation_16_2.htm">Revelation 16:2-3</a>).<p>"The earth and the sea" signify the church internal and external, thus the entire church, because, in the spiritual world, they who are in the internals of the church appear upon dry land, and they who are in its externals, as in the seas; but the seas are appearances from the general truths in which they are. That "earth" signifies the church, may be seen, (<a href="285.htm">285</a>); so also "the world" (<a href="551.htm">551</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 398 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>398. (Vers. 7.) "Et primus Angelus clanxit," significat explorationem et manifestationem, qualis status Ecclesiae est apud illos qui interius in illa fide sunt. - Per "clangere" significatur explorare et manifestare (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_398/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_397" target=_top>397</a>); quod per "clangorem primi hujus Angeli" intelligatur exploratio et manifestatio status Ecclesiae apud illos qui interius in illa fide sunt, est quia operatio ejus facta est in "terram," ut sequitur, et operatio clangoris secundi Angeli in "mare;" et per terram et mare" ubivis in Apocalypsi, dum utrumque nominatur, intelligitur universa Ecclesia, per "terram" Ecclesia ex illis qui in internis ejus sunt, et per "mare" Ecclesia ex illis qui in externis ejus sunt; Ecclesia enim est interna et externa, interna apud Clericos, externa apud Laicos, seu interna apud illos qui interius studuerunt doctrinalibus ejus, et confirmaverunt illa ex Verbo, et externa apud illos qui non ita.
