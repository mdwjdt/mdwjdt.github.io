<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第430节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>430.启9:7.“蝗虫的形状”表那些确认与仁分离之信的人的表现和形像。“形状”表示他们以代表性形像的表现；“蝗虫”表示最末端或最表层部位中的虚假（<a href="424.htm">424</a>节）；因为虚假与那些陷入虚假的人合而为一，所以他们也由“蝗虫”来表示。“蝗虫”表示那些确认唯信或其虚假的人，这一点通过以下事实向我清楚显明：陷入唯信的长老们拥抱并亲吻那些看似蝗虫的人，还盛情邀请他们到自己家里去。因为在灵界，形像，也就是天使和灵人的情感和思维的代表形式，看上去就像是活的，同样也显为各种走兽、飞鸟和鱼类。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 430</h4><p>430. The locusts in appearance. (<a href="3927/revelation_9_7.htm">9:7</a>) This symbolizes the appearance and likeness of those people who affirmed in themselves a faith divorced from charity.<p>The appearance symbolizes their appearance in a representative image. Locusts symbolize falsities of the lowest sort (no. <a href="424.htm">424</a>); and because falsities are inseparable from the people who possess them, those people too are symbolically meant by locusts.<p>That locusts mean people who have affirmed in themselves faith alone, or the falsities of those people, was made clearly apparent to me from seeing church elders who espoused that faith embracing and kissing those who looked like locusts, and wishing to invite them into their homes. For likenesses, which are forms representative of the affections and thoughts of angels and spirits in the spiritual world, seem to be alive, in like manner as animals, birds and fish, as previously described. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 430</h4><p>430. [verse 7] 'And the likenesses of the locusts' signifies the appearances and images of those who have confirmed in themselves a faith separated from charity. By 'the likenesses' are signified their appearances in a representative image. By 'the locusts' are signified the untruths in the outer parts (<a href="424.htm">424</a>); and because the untruths make one with those who are in the untruths, these themselves are signified by 'the locusts.' That those who have confirmed faith alone in themselves, or their untruths, are understood by 'the locusts' was clearly evident to me from this fact, that the presbyters who were in that faith embraced the locusts that were seen and kissed them, and were desirous of introducing them into their houses; for the images that are representative forms of the affections and thoughts of angels and spirits in the spiritual world appear as if alive, just like the animals, flying creatures and fishes treated of before. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 430</h4><p>430. Verse 7. And the likenesses of the locusts, signifies the appearances and images of those who have confirmed in themselves faith separated from charity. By "likenesses," is signified their appearances in a representative image; by "locusts," are signified falsities in outermost things, (<a href="424.htm">424</a>); and as falsities make one with those who are in falsities, they also are signified by "locusts." That they who have confirmed themselves in faith alone, or their falsities, are meant by "locusts," appeared evident to me from this circumstance, that the presbyters who were in that faith, embraced the locusts that were seen, and kissed them, and were desirous of introducing them into their houses. For the images, which are forms representative of the affections and thoughts of angels and spirits in the spiritual world, appear as if they were alive, in like manner as the animals, birds, and fishes, mentioned above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 430 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>430. (Vers. 7.) "Et similitudines locustarum," significat apparentias et imagines illorum qui fidem separatam a charitate apud se confirmaverunt. - Per "similitudines" significantur apparentiae illorum in imagine repraesentativa; per "locustas" significantur falsa in extremis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_430/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_424" target=_top>424</a>); et quia falsa unum faciunt cum illis qui in falsis sunt, etiam ipsi per "locustas" significantur. Quod illi qui apud se confirmaverunt solam fidem, seu falsa illorum, per "locustas" intelligantur, patuit mihi clare ex eo, quod presbyteri, qui in fide illa erant, locustas visas amplexi sint et osculati, ac in domos suas introducere vellent; imagines enim, quae sunt formae repraesentativae affectionum et cogitationum angelorum et spirituum in mundo spirituali, apparent sicut vivae, similiter ut animalia, volucres et pisces, de quibus prius. </p>
