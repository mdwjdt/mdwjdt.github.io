<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第400节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>400.启8:7.“丢在地上，树的三分之一部分被烧了”表对那些处于教会内在，并陷入唯信的人来说，构成教会之人的对真理的一切情感和领悟都灭亡了。“雹子与火搀着血”所丢向的“地”表示那些处于教会内在、陷入唯信之人当中的教会。这些人是神职人员（参看<a href="398.htm">398</a>节）。“三分之一部分”表示真理的全部，“四分之一部分”表示良善的全部（<a href="322.htm">322</a>节）。“三”表示全部、完全、整个（参看<a href="505.htm">505</a>节）；因此，“三分之一“，也就是“三分之一部分”所表相同。“被烧了”表示灭亡，在此表示源于地狱之爱的虚假，这虚假由“雹子与火搀着血”来表示（参看<a href="399.htm">399</a>节）。“树”表示人；由于人之为人，凭的是属于意愿的情感和属于认知的领悟，故这些也由“树”来表示。人与树之间也存在一种对应关系；所以天上会出现树木林立的乐园，对应于天使们的情感和由此而来的领悟；同样，地狱的某些地方也有树的森林，只是这些树照着与住在那里的居民的欲望和相应思维的对应关系而结出坏果子。“树”总体上表示人的情感和由此而来的领悟，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>田野的树木都必知道，我耶和华使高树矮小，矮树高大，青树枯干，枯树发旺。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结17.24.htm">17:24</a>）</p><p>倚靠耶和华的，那人有福了；他必像树栽于水旁，而且结果不止。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.7.htm">17:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.8.htm">8</a>）</p><p>惟喜爱律法，这人便为有福；他要像一棵树栽在溪水旁，按时候结果子。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗1.3.htm">3</a>）</p><p>结果的树木，你当赞美耶和华。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.9.htm">148:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>耶和华的树都满了。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.16.htm">104:16</a>）</p><p>现在斧子已经放在树根上，凡不结好果子的树就砍下来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.10.htm">3:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.16.htm">7:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.20.htm">20</a>）</p><p>你们或以为树好，果子也好；树坏，果子也坏；因为看果子就可以知道树。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.33.htm">12:33</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.43.htm">6:43</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.44.htm">44</a>）</p><p>我必使火着起，烧灭一切青树和枯树。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.47.htm">20:47</a>）</p><p>正因“树”表示人，所以经上规定：</p><p>迦南地中可作食物的树上果实为未受割礼的。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.23.htm">19:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.25.htm">25</a>）</p><p>还有：</p><p>当城被围困时，他们不可举斧头砍任何结好果子的树。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申20.19.htm">20:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申20.20.htm">20</a>）</p><p>以及：</p><p>在住棚节期间，他们拿好树上的果子在耶和华面前欢乐。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.40.htm">23:40</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.41.htm">41</a>）</p><p>此外还有其它经文，它们因为数太多，在此不再引用。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 400</h4><p>400. And they were cast down to the earth, and a third of the trees were burned up. This symbolically means that in people concerned with the internal elements of the church and caught up in faith alone, all affection for truth and perception of truth, which make a person a person of the church, had perished.<p>To be shown that the earth to which the hail and fire mingled with blood were cast down symbolizes the church among people concerned with its internal elements and caught up in faith alone, and that these are the clergy, see no. <a href="398.htm">398</a> above. A third part symbolizes everything in relation to truth, as a fourth part symbolizes everything in relation to goodness (no. <a href="322.htm">322</a>). That the number three symbolizes all, completeness, and totally, will be seen in no. <a href="505.htm">505</a> below. A third part or a third consequently has the same symbolism.<p>To be burned up means, symbolically, to perish - in this case to perish by falsity springing from a hellish love, which is what is meant by hail and fire mingled with blood, as just explained in no. <a href="399.htm">399</a> above.<p>A tree symbolizes a person. And because a person is human by virtue of the affection of his will and the perception of his intellect, these also are therefore symbolized by a tree.<p>There is as well a correspondence between a person and a tree. Consequently in heaven one sees paradisal parks formed of trees that correspond to the affections and resulting perceptions of angels. And elsewhere, in hell, there are forests formed of trees that bear harmful fruit, in accordance with their correspondence to the lusts and resulting thoughts of the inhabitants there.<p>That trees in general symbolize people in respect to their affections and consequently perceptions can be seen from the following passages:<p>All the trees of the field shall know that I, Jehovah, bring low the tall tree and raise up the low tree, and dry up the green tree and make the dry tree burgeon. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_17_24.htm">Ezekiel 17:24</a>)<p>Blessed is the man who trusts in Jehovah... He shall be like a tree planted by the waters... Nor will He cease from bearing fruit. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_17_7.htm">Jeremiah 17:7-8</a>)<p>Blessed is the man...(whose) delight is in the law... He shall be like a tree planted by rivers of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season... (<a href="3927/psalms_1_1.htm">Psalms 1:1-3</a>)<p>Praise Jehovah... you fruitful trees... (<a href="3927/psalms_148_7.htm">Psalms 148:7-9</a>)<p>Satiated are the trees of Jehovah... (<a href="3927/psalms_104_16.htm">Psalms 104:16</a>)<p>...the ax is laid to the root of the tree... ...every tree which does not bear good fruit will be cut down... (<a href="3927/matthew_3_10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a>; cf. <a href="3927/matthew_7_16.htm">7:16-20</a>)<p>Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or else make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten; for a tree is known by its fruit. (<a href="3927/matthew_12_33.htm">Matthew 12:33</a>, cf. <a href="3927/luke_6_43.htm">Luke 6:43-44</a>)<p>...I will kindle a fire..., (which) shall devour every green tree and every dry tree... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_20_47.htm">Ezekiel 20:47</a>)<p>Since a tree symbolizes a person, therefore it was a statute that the fruit of a tree serving for food in the land of Canaan be uncircumcised (<a href="3927/leviticus_19_23.htm">Leviticus 19:23-25</a>). Furthermore, that when the people besieged a city, they not take an axe to any tree bearing good fruit (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_20_19.htm">Deuteronomy 20:19-20</a>). And still other regulations, which we do not cite here owing to their number. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 400</h4><p>400. 'And hurled upon the land, and a third part of the trees was burnt' signifies that with those who are in the internal things of the Church and in faith alone, every affection and perception of truth that make the man of the Church had perished. By the 'land' upon which the hail and fire mingled with blood were hurled is signified the Church with those who are in the internal things thereof and in faith alone. That these are the clergy may be seen above (<a href="398.htm">398</a>). By 'a third part' is signified all as to truth, just as by 'a fourth part' all as to good (<a href="322.htm">322</a>). That by 'three,' persons or things, is signified all, full, and altogether, will be seen below (<a href="505.htm">505</a>). Consequently by 'a third' which is 'a third part' the like is signified. By 'to be burnt' is signified to perish, here by means of the untruth derived from infernal love that is understood by 'hail and fire mingled with blood,' of which just above (<a href="399.htm">399</a>). By a 'tree' is signified man; and because a man is a man by virtue of the affection that is of the will and the perception that is of the understanding, therefore these are also signified by 'tree.' There is indeed a correspondence between a man and a tree, and therefore in heaven there appear paradises of trees, which correspond to the affections and consequent perceptions of angels; and also in some places in hell there are forests of trees that bear bad fruits, in accordance with a correspondence with the lusts and consequent thoughts of those there. That 'trees' in general signify men as to their affections and consequent perceptions, can be established from the following passages:<p>All the trees of the field shall know that I Jehovah have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree sprout forth. <a href="3927/ezekiel_17_24.htm">Ezekiel 17:24</a>.<p>Blessed is the man who trusts in Jehovah, he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, he shall not cease from bearing fruit. <a href="3927/jeremiah_17_7.htm">Jeremiah 17:7-8</a>.<p>Blessed is the man whose good pleasure is in the law, he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of waters, that gives fruit in its season. <a href="3927/psalms_1_1.htm">Psalms 1:1-3</a>.<p>Praise Jehovah, O fruit trees. <a href="3927/psalms_148_9.htm">Psalms 148:9</a>.<p>The trees of Jehovah are full of sap. <a href="3927/psalms_104_16.htm">Psalms 104:16</a>.<p>The axe lies at the root of the tree, every tree not producing good fruit shall be hewn down. <a href="3927/matthew_3_10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_7_16.htm">7:16-20</a>.<p>Either make the tree good and the fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and the fruit corrupt, for the tree is known by its fruit. <a href="3927/matthew_12_33.htm">Matthew 12:33</a>; <a href="3927/luke_6_43.htm">Luke 6:43-44</a>.<p>I will kindle a fire that shall devour every green tree and every dry tree. <a href="3927/ezekiel_20_47.htm">Ezekiel 20:47</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/ezekiel_21_3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a>].<p>Since 'a tree' signifies a man, therefore it was a statute that:<p>The fruit of a tree serving for food in the land of Canaan should be circumcised. <a href="3927/leviticus_19_23.htm">Leviticus 19:23-25</a>.<p>Also:<p>When any city was besieged, they should not wield an axe against any tree of good fruit. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_20_19.htm">Deuteronomy 20:19-20</a>.<p>As also that:<p>At the feast of tabernacles they should take the fruit of the tree of honour, and be glad before Jehovah. <a href="3927/leviticus_23_40.htm">Leviticus 23:40-41</a>.<p>Besides more passages, which are not adduced here by reason of their abundance. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 400</h4><p>400. And they were cast upon the earth, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, signifies that with those who are in the internals of the church and in faith alone, every affection and perception of truth, which make the man of the church, perished. By "the earth," upon which were cast "hail and fire mingled with blood," is signified the church with those who are in its internals, and in faith alone. That these are the clergy, may be seen above, (<a href="398.htm">398</a>). By "the third part" is signified all as to truth, as by "the fourth part," all as to good, (<a href="322.htm">322</a>). That by "three" is signified all, full, and altogether, will be seen below, (<a href="505.htm">505</a>); thence, by "a third," which is "a third part," the same is signified. By "being burnt up" is signified to perish, here by falsity from infernal love, which is meant by "hail and fire mingled with blood," see above, (<a href="399.htm">399</a>). By "a tree" is signified man; and as man is man from affection, which is of the will, and from perception, which is of the understanding, therefore these also are signified by "a tree." There is also a correspondence between man and a tree; wherefore in heaven there appear paradises of trees, which correspond to the affections and the perceptions therefrom of the angels; and, likewise, in some places in hell there are forests of trees which bear evil fruits, according to correspondence with the lusts and the thoughts therefrom of those who are there. That "trees" in general signify men as to their affections and perceptions therefrom, may appear from the following passages:<p>All the trees of the field shall know, that I Jehovah have brought down the high tree, I have exalted the low tree, I have dried up the green tree, and I have made the dry tree to shoot forth, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_17_24.htm">Ezekiel 17:24</a>).<p>Happy is the man that trusteth in Jehovah, for he shall be like a tree planted by the waters, he shall not cease from bearing fruit, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_17_7.htm">Jeremiah 17:7-8</a> Happy is the man whose good pleasure is in the law; he shall be like a tree planted by the brooks of waters, that giveth fruit in its season, (<a href="3927/psalms_1_1.htm">Psalms 1:1-3</a>).<p>Praise Jehovah, ye trees of fruit, (<a href="3927/psalms_148_9.htm">Psalms 148:9</a>).<p>The trees of Jehovah are full, (<a href="3927/psalms_104_16.htm">Psalms 104:16</a>).<p>The axe is laid at the root of the tree, every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, (<a href="3927/matthew_3_10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_7_16.htm">7:16-20</a>).<p>Either make the tree good and the fruit good; or make the tree corrupt and the fruit corrupt; for the tree is known from the fruit, (<a href="3927/matthew_12_33.htm">Matthew 12:33</a>; <a href="3927/luke_6_43.htm">Luke 6:43-44</a>).<p>I will kindle a fire which shall devour every green tree, and every dry tree, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_20_47.htm">Ezekiel 20:47</a>).<p>Since a tree signifies man, therefore it was ordained that:<p>The fruit of a tree serving for food in the land of Canaan should be circumcised, (<a href="3927/leviticus_19_23.htm">Leviticus 19:23-25</a>).<p>Also:<p>When any city was besieged, they should not put forth an axe against any tree of good fruit, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_20_19.htm">Deuteronomy 20:19-20</a>).<p>As also that:<p>At the feast of tabernacles they should take fruit of the tree of honor, and be glad before Jehovah, (<a href="3927/leviticus_23_40.htm">Leviticus 23:40-41</a>).<p>Besides other passages, which are not here adduced by reason of their abundance. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 400 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>400. "Et missa in terram, et tertia pars arborum combusta est," significat quod apud illos qui in internis Ecclesiae sunt et in sola fide, omnis affectio et perceptio veri, quae faciunt hominem Ecclesiae, perierint. - Per "terram," in quam "grando et ignis mixta sanguine" missa sunt, significatur Ecclesia apud illos qui (in) internis ejus sunt et in sola fide, qui quod sint Clerici, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_400/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_398" target=_top>398</a>); per "tertiam partem" significatur omne quoad verum, sicut per "quartam partem omne quoad bonum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_400/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_322" target=_top>322</a>); quod per "tria" seu "tres," significetur omne, plenum et prorsus, videbitur infra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_400/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_505" target=_top>505</a>), inde per "tertium" quod est "tertia pars," significatur simile: per "comburi" significatur perire, hic per falsum ex amore infernali, quod intelligitur per "grandinem et ignem mixta sanguine," de quibus mox supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_400/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_399" target=_top>399</a>). Per "arborem" significatur homo; et quia homo est homo ex affectione quae est voluntatis et ex perceptione quae est intellectus, ideo hae quoque per "arborem" significantur: est etiam correspondentia inter hominem et arborem; quare in Caelo apparent paradisi ex arboribus, quae affectionibus et inde perceptionibus Angelorum correspondent; et quoque sunt alicubi in Inferno sylvae ex arboribus quae malos fructus ferunt, secundum correspondentiam cum concupiscentiis et inde cogitationibus illorum ibi.
