<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第759节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>759.“地上的客商，因她奢华太过就发了财”表教阶中具有大大小小级别的人，他们通过统治神圣事物而追求神性威严和超越帝王的荣耀，并不断致力于通过他们名下修道院和个人财产的增多，以及无止境地从世界所聚敛和累积的财富坚固它，从而通过将属天和属灵的统治权据为己有而为自己获得肉体和属世的快乐。巴比伦的“客商”无非表示在天主教的教阶中具有大大小小级别的人，因为本章23节经文说到，他们“原来是地上的大人物”；让他们“发了财”的“奢华太过”无非表示他们为自己获得对世人的灵魂，因而对其产业和财富的统治权所凭借的信条。众所周知，他们无止境地聚敛这些东西，用它们填满自己的宝库；人们也知道，他们拿教会的神圣事物作交易，如通过让人们向修道院、圣徒及其像进行奉献和馈赠，或弥撒、宽容、豁免来贩卖救恩，也就是天堂。</p><p>谁看不出，教皇统治在宗教改革时期一直没有被打破，他们还会在整个欧洲各国搜刮产业和财富，然后成为唯一的领主，而其余的人都成为奴仆？在过去的几个世纪，他们的权力超过帝王，如果帝王不顺服，他们就会将其逐出教会，并废黜，自那时起，他们不是一直拥有巨额财富吗？如今他们每年不是仍有巨额进账，宝库不仍堆满金银宝石吗？这种类似未开化的统治欲仍占据他们当中许多人的心智，若突破限制，唯一能约束他们的，就是对丧失统治权的恐惧。然而，如此庞大的收入、财宝、产业除了让他们以此为乐为骄傲，并巩固统治，直到永远外，还有什么用处呢？由此可知“地上的客商，因她（即巴比伦）奢华太过就发了财”表示什么。在以赛亚书，他们也被称为“客商”：</p><p>巴比伦的居民如同碎秸，火已将他们烧尽；他们不能救自己脱离火焰之手，这就是从幼年与你贸易的客商。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.14.htm">47:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.15.htm">15</a>）。</p><p>在圣言中，买卖与贸易或经商、交易表示为自己获取属灵的财富，就是真理与良善的知识，在反面意义是虚假与邪恶的知识；通过后者赚得世界，通过前者赚得天堂。所以，主将天国比作寻找好珠子的买卖人（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.45.htm">13:45</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.46.htm">46</a>）；教会之人比作交给他们银子、叫他们做买卖赚钱的仆人（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.14.htm">25:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.30.htm">30</a>）；并且给了他们十锭银子，叫他们同样用来做买卖赚钱（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.12.htm">19:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.26.htm">26</a>）。“推罗”表示教会对真理和良善的认知，故以西结书整个27章都在论述她的交易和获利；并论到她说：</p><p>你靠自己的智慧聪明得了金银财宝，你靠自己的大智慧和贸易增添资财。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结 28.4.htm"> 28:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结 28.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p></p><p>推罗变得荒凉，她的客商是王子，她的买卖人是地上的尊贵人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.1.htm">23:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.8.htm">8</a>）</p><p>在迦南地的犹太人当中，遭败坏的教会被称为“贸易之地”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.3.htm">16:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.29.htm">29</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结21.30.htm">21:30</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.14.htm">29:14</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结17.4.htm">17:4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.18.htm">28:18</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 759</h4><p>759. "And the merchants of the earth have become rich owing to the potencies of her delights." This symbolizes the greater and lower in rank in the Roman Catholic hierarchy who by their dominion over sacred things strive for Divine majesty and superregal glory, who continually seek to establish it by multiplying the number of monasteries and possessions under their control, and by collecting and accumulating the world's treasures without end, and who thus procure for themselves physical and natural delights and gratifications by claiming for themselves a celestial and spiritual dominion.<p>The merchants of Babylon can only mean the greater and lower in rank in their church hierarchy, because in verse <a href="3927/revelation_18_23.htm">23</a> of this chapter we are told that they are the great men of the earth. And the potencies of her delights with which they have become rich can only mean the dogmas that are the means by which they acquire for themselves dominion over people's souls, and so also over their possessions and wealth. People know that they collect these without end and swell their treasuries with them, and also that they make merchandise of the sanctities of the church, by selling salvation, for example, or heaven, in exchange for offerings and gifts made to monasteries and their saints and images, or in exchange for masses, indulgences and various dispensations.</p><p>[2] Who cannot see that if the papal dominion had not been broken at the time of the Protestant Reformation, Roman Catholics would have scraped together the possessions and wealth of all the kingdoms in the whole of Europe? And that then they would have made themselves the sole lords, and everyone else their servants? Do they not have the greatest part of their wealth from preceding centuries when they had power over emperors and kings, whom they could excommunicate and depose if they did not obey? And do they not still have annual incomes that are immense, and treasuries full of gold, silver, and precious stones?<p>The same barbarous lust for dominion is still lodged in the hearts of many of them, and is restrained only by a fear of its loss if it should extend beyond accepted limits.<p>Of what use, however, are such great incomes, treasures and possessions to them, other than to be delighted by them, to pride themselves on having them, and to establish their dominion to eternity?<p>It can be seen from this what is here symbolized by merchants of the earth who have become rich owing to the potencies of Babylon's delights.<p>They are called merchants also in Isaiah:<p>(The inhabitants of Babylon) are as stubble. Fire has burned them; they do not deliver their soul from the power of the flame... Such are... your merchants from your youth. (<a href="3927/isaiah_47_14.htm">Isaiah 47:14-15</a>)</p><p>[3] In the Word, to be a merchant or trader means, symbolically, to be engaged in procuring for oneself spiritual riches, which are concepts of truth and goodness, and in an opposite sense, concepts of falsity and evil, and to use the first to gain heaven, and the second to gain the world. For that reason the Lord likened the kingdom of heaven to a merchant seeking beautiful pearls (<a href="3927/matthew_13_45.htm">Matthew 13:45-46</a>), and the people in the church to servants who were given talents with which to trade and gain more (<a href="3927/matthew_25_14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), or who were given ten minas with which to likewise trade and gain more (<a href="3927/luke_19_12.htm">Luke 19:12-26</a>).<p>Moreover, because Tyre symbolizes the church in respect to its concepts of truth and goodness, therefore the whole of chapter twenty-seven in Ezekiel has trading and gain as its subject, and we are told concerning Tyre:<p>In your wisdom and your understanding you have gained... for yourself... gold and silver into your treasuries; and by the great wisdom in your trading you have increased your riches... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4-5</a>)<p>And elsewhere:<p>...Tyre... has been laid waste..., whose merchants are princes, and its traders the honorable of the earth. (<a href="3927/isaiah_23_1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_23_8.htm">8</a>)<p>Also, the corrupt church among Jews in the land of Canaan is called the land of trade (<a href="3927/ezekiel_16_3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_29.htm">29</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_21_30.htm">21:30</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_29_14.htm">29:14</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 759</h4><p>759. 'And the merchants of the land have become rich through the abundance of her luxuries (delitiae)' signifies the greater and less in rank in that hierarchy, who by a dominion over holy things aspire to Divine majesty and more than regal glory, and continually aim to establish them by a multiplication of monasteries and the possessions under them, and by the treasures which without end they gather together and accumulate from the world, and thus procure for themselves bodily and natural delights and pleasures as a result of the attribution of heavenly and spiritual dominion to themselves. By 'the merchants' of Babylon no others can be understood than the greater and less in rank in their ecclesiastical hierarchy, because in verse 23 of this chapter it is said that they are 'the great ones of the land'; and by 'the abundance of luxuries' by which they 'have become rich' nothing else can be understood than the dogmas by which as means they procure for themselves a dominion over the souls of men, and thus also over their possessions and wealth. That they gather these together without end and fill up their treasuries with them is known; then also that they trade with the holy things of the Church, as that by offerings and gifts made to monasteries and to the saints and images thereof, and by masses, indulgences and various dispensations they sell salvation, that is, heaven.</p><p>[2] Who is unable to see that if the papal dominion had not been broken at the time of the Reformation they would have scraped together the possessions and wealth of all the kingdoms in the whole of Europe, and that then they would have become the only lords, and all the rest slaves? Do they not have their principal wealth from the preceding ages, when they had authority over emperors and kings whom they could excommunicate and dethrone if they were not obedient? And do they not still have annual incomes that are immense, and treasuries full of gold, silver and precious stones? A like uncivilised dominion still possesses the minds (animus) of many of them, and it is restrained solely through the fear of its loss, if extended beyond limits. But of what use are such great incomes, treasures and possessions except that they may have delight and pride in them, and that they may strengthen their domination to eternity? From these considerations it can be established what is signified by 'the merchants of the land' who 'have become rich through the abundance of the luxuries' of Babylon. They are called 'merchants' also in Isaiah:<p>The inhabitants of Babel have become as stubble, fire has scorched them, they do not snatch away their soul out of the hand of the flame; such are thy merchants from youth. <a href="3927/isaiah_47_14.htm">Isaiah 47:14-15</a>.</p><p>[3] By 'to traffic and trade' (mercari et negotiari) in the Word is signified to procure for oneself spiritual wealth, consisting of cognitions of what is true and good, and in the opposite sense cognitions of what is false and evil, and to gain the world by the latter, and to gain heaven by the former. Therefore the Lord compared:<p>The kingdom of the heavens to a trader seeking beautiful pearls. <a href="3927/matthew_13_45.htm">Matthew 13:45-46</a>;<p>And the men of the Church to the servants to whom were given talents with which they should trade and make a profit. <a href="3927/matthew_25_14.htm">Matthew 25:14-20</a>;<p>And to those to whom were given ten pounds (mina), with which likewise they should trade and make a profit. <a href="3927/luke_19_12.htm">Luke 19:12-26</a>.<p>And because the Church as to cognitions of what is true and good is signified by 'Tyre,' it therefore treats of her trading and gain in the whole of chapter <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_1.htm">27</a> in Ezekiel, and it is said of her:<p>In thy wisdom and in thine intelligence thou hast made for thyself gold and silver in thy treasures, and by the multitude of wisdom in thy trading thou hast multiplied wealth for thyself <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_1.htm">Ezekiel 28</a>:[<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_4.htm">4</a>,] <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_5.htm">5</a>; and elsewhere:<p>Tyre has been laid waste, whose merchants are princes, and traders are the honourable of the land. <a href="3927/isaiah_23_1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_23_8.htm">8</a>.<p>And the perverted Church with the Jews in the land of Canaan is called 'the land of trading' (<a href="3927/ezekiel_16_3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_29.htm">29</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_21_30.htm">21:30</a> [H.B. 35]; <a href="3927/ezekiel_29_14.htm">29:14</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 759</h4><p>759. And the merchants of the earth have become rich from the abundance of her luxuries, signifies the greater and the less in rank in that hierarchy, who through dominion over holy things strive for Divine majesty and super-regal glory, and continually aim to establish them firmly by the multiplication of monasteries and of possessions under them, and by the treasures which without end they gather together and accumulate from the world, and thus procure for themselves corporeal and natural delights and pleasures from the celestial and spiritual dominion attributed to themselves. No others can be meant by "the merchants of Babylon" than the greater and the lesser in rank in their ecclesiastical hierarchy, because in verse 23 of this chapter it is said that they are "the great ones of the earth;" and by "the abundance of her luxuries by which they have become rich," nothing else can be meant than the dogmas, by which, as means, they procure for themselves dominion over the souls of men, and thus also over their possessions and wealth. That they gather these together without end, and distend their treasures with them, is known. Then also that they make traffic of the holy things of the church, as that by offerings and gifts made to the monasteries and their saints and images, and by various masses, indulgences, and dispensations, they sell salvation, that is, heaven.</p><p>[2] Who cannot see that if the papal dominion had not been broken at the time of the Reformation, they would have scraped together the possessions and wealth of all the kingdoms in the whole of Europe? and then that they would have become the sole lords, and all the rest slaves? Have they not extraordinary opulence from former ages, when they had authority over emperors and kings, whom, if they were not obedient, they could excommunicate and dethrone? And have they not still annual incomes which are immense, and great treasuries full of gold, silver, and precious stones? A like barbarous dominion is seated still in the minds [animus] of very many of them; and it is restrained solely through the fear of its loss, if it is extended beyond bounds. But of what use are such great revenues, treasures, and possessions, except that they may delight and take pride in them, and confirm their domination to eternity? From this it is evident, what is here signified by "the merchants of the earth," who have become rich from the abundance of the luxuries of Babylon. They are called "merchants" also in Isaiah:<p>The inhabitants of Babel have become as stubble, the fire hath burned them up; they shall not deliver their soul from the hand of the flame; such are thy merchants from thy youth, (<a href="3927/isaiah_47_14.htm">Isaiah 47:14-15</a>).</p><p>[3] By trafficking and trading is signified in the Word to procure for themselves spiritual riches, which are the knowledges of truth and good, and in the opposite sense the knowledges of falsity and evil; and to gain the world by the latter, and to gain heaven by the former. Wherefore the Lord compared:<p>The kingdom of the heavens to a merchantman seeking beautiful pearls, (<a href="3927/matthew_13_45.htm">Matthew 13:45-46</a>);<p>And the men of the church to servants, to whom the talents were given, with which they should trade and make gain, (<a href="3927/matthew_25_14.htm">Matthew 25:14-20</a>);<p>And to whom ten pounds were given, with which they should in like manner trade and make gain, (<a href="3927/luke_19_12.htm">Luke 19:12-26</a>).<p>And because the church as to the knowledges of truth and good is signified by "Tyre," therefore it treats of her traffic and gain in the whole of chapter 27 of Ezekiel; and it is said of her:<p>In thy wisdom and in thy intelligence thou hast made for thyself gold and silver in thy treasures, and by the multitude of wisdom in thy traffic hast thou multiplied for thyself wealth, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4-5</a>).<p>And elsewhere:<p>Tyre is devastated, whose merchants were princes, and her traders the honorable of the earth, (<a href="3927/isaiah_23_1.htm">Isaiah 23:1-8</a>).<p>And the church perverted with the Jews in the land of Canaan is called:<p>The land of trading, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_16_3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_29.htm">29</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_21_30.htm">21:30</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_29_14.htm">29:14</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_17_4.htm">17:4</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_18.htm">28:18</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 759 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>759. "Et mercatores terrae ex facultatibus deliciaruin ejus ditati sunt," significat majores et minores ordinis in Hierarchia illa, qui per dominium super sancta aucupant Divinam majestatem et superregiam gloriam, et continue affectant constabilire illas per multiplicationem monasteriorum et possessionum sub illis, et per thesauros, quos absque fine e mundo congregant et cumulant, et sic sibi comparant jucunditates et amoenitates corporeas et naturales ex attributo sibi Dominio caelesti et spirituali. -Per "mercatores Babylonis" non alii possunt intelligi quam majores et minores ordinis in Hierarchia eorum ecclesiastica, quia in vers. 23 hujus capitis dicitur quod sint "magnates terrae;" et per "facultates deliciarum quibus ditati sunt," non alia possunt intelligi, quam dogmata, per quae ut media sibi comparant dominium super animas hominum, et sic etiam super possessiones et opes eorum; quod has congregent absque fine, et illis distendant thesauraria sua, notum est; tum etiam quod negotientur cum sanctis Ecclesiae, ut quod per oblationes et dona data monasteriis et eorum sanctis et simulacris, et per missas, indulgentias et dispensationes varias, vendant salutem, hoc est, Caelum. Quis non videre potest, quod si dominium papale non fractum fuisset tempore Reformationis, corrasissent possessiones et opes omnium regnorum in universa Europa, et tunc quod illi soli domini facti fuissent, et omnes reliqui servi; annon ex saeculis quae praecedunt, quando illis fuit potestas super imperatores et reges, quos, si non obedirent, potuerunt excommunicare et abdicare, praecipua illis opulentia est, et adhuc annui reditus qui immensi, ac thesauraria plena auro, argento et lapidibus pretiosis. Simile dominium barbarum insidet adhuc animis plurium eorum, et unice per timorem jacturae ejus, si ultra limites extenditur, coercetur. Sed cui usui sunt tanti reditus, thesauri et possessiones, nisi ut ex illis delicientur et superbiant, ac ut dominatum suum in aeternum firment. Ex his constare potest, quid hic per "mercatores terrae, qui ex facultatibus deliciarum Babylonis ditati sunt," significatur. Vocantur etiam "mercatores" apud Esajam: <p>Facti sunt habitatatores Babelis "Sicut stipula, ignis adussit eos, non eripiunt animam suam e manu flammae: tales sunt Mercatores tui a juventute," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_47_14-15" target=_top>47:14-15</a>).<p>Per "mercari" et "negotiari" in Verbo significatur comparare sibi opes spirituales, quae sunt cognitiones veri et boni, et in opposito sensu cognitiones falsi et mali, et per has lucrari mundum, et per illas lucrari Caelum; quare Dominus comparavit Regnum caelorum Negotiatori quaerenti pulchras margaritas, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_13_45-46" target=_top>Matthaeus 13:45-46</a>);<p>Et homines Ecclesiae servis, quibus data sunt talenta, cum quibus negotiarentur et lucrarentur, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_25_14-20" target=_top>Matthaeus 25:14-20</a>);<p>Et quibus datae sunt decem Minae, cum quibus similiter negotiarentur et lucrarentur, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_19_12-26" target=_top>Luca 19:12-26</a>).<p>Et quia per "Tyrum" significatur Ecclesia quoad cognitiones veri et boni, ideo agitur de negotiatione et lucratione ejus in toto capite <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_27_1-36" target=_top>27</a>., apud Ezechielem; et dicitur de illa, <p>"In sapientia tua et in intelligentia tua feceras tibi aurum et argentum in thesauris tuis, et per multitudinem sapientiae in negotiatione tua multiplicasti tibi opes, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_28_1-26" target=_top>Ezechiel 28</a>:(<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_28_4" target=_top>4</a>,) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_28_5" target=_top>5</a>);<p>et alibi: <p>"Devastata est Tyrus, cujus Mercatores principes, et Negotiatores honorati terrae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_23_1" target=_top>Esaias 23:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_23_8" target=_top>8</a>).<p>Et Ecclesia perversa apud Judaeos in terra Canaane vocatur "Terra Negotiationis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_16_3" target=_top>Ezechiel 16:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_16_29" target=_top>29</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_21_1-32" target=_top>21</a>:35 (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_21_30" target=_top>30</a>); <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_29_14" target=_top>29:14</a>; <sup>1</sup>(tum quoque <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_17_4" target=_top>17:4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_759/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_28_18" target=_top>28:18</a>)).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Vid.
