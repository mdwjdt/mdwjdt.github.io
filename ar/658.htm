<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>658.“因为神的烈怒在这七灾中发尽了”表教会的毁灭，和那时它的终结。很快会看到，“发尽了”表示教会的毁灭，和那时它的终结；“神的烈怒”表示人的邪恶，这恶因反对神，故被称为“神的烈怒”；不是神向人发怒，而是人因其恶而向神发怒，并且由于人因其恶而受惩罚和折磨时，如死后在地狱中的情形，在人看来，这一切似乎出于神，故在圣言中，烈怒和愤怒，甚至邪恶，都被归到神身上。但这只是字面上的意思，因为字义是照着表象和对应来写的，不是灵义上的意思，因为灵义里面没有表象和对应，只有在自己光中的真理；关于愤怒，可参看前文（<a href="525.htm">525</a>，<a href="635.htm">635</a>节）。经上说“神的烈怒在这七灾中发尽了”，以此表示教会的毁灭，和那时它的终结；有必要解释一下原因。随着时间推移，每个教会都因远离爱之良善和信之真理，直到它们荡然无存而逐渐衰退；这一切随着邪恶与虚假的相继增长而发生；当不再有任何爱与信的良善时，那么就只有邪恶与虚假了；当到了这种地步时，教会的终结就到来了。在终结期间，人只知道邪恶是良善，虚假是真理，因为他出于所感受到的邪恶与虚假里面的快乐而热爱并因此确认它们。</p><p>在以下经文中，这就是“灭绝”（consummation，或译“结局”、“完结”、“满盈”、“末了”等）所表示、被称为“荒凉”（devastation，或译毁灭，荒废等）的终结（end）：</p><p>我从耶和华那里听见已经决定在全地上施行灭绝的事。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.22.htm">28:22</a>）</p><p>原来灭绝的事已定，必有公义涨溢，因为主万军之耶和华，在全地之中，必成就所定规的结局。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.22.htm">10:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.23.htm">23</a>）</p><p>耶和华的怒火必吞灭全地，因为祂要快快灭绝这地的一切居民。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.18.htm">1:18</a>）  </p><p>那荒凉最终必临到可憎的飞鸟身上，直到所定的结局，它必倾在那行毁坏的身上。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.27.htm">9:27</a>）</p><p>全地必成为荒场，我却不灭绝。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.27.htm">4:27</a>）</p><p>我现在要下去，察看他们是否真的像那达到我这里的嚷叫声一样完结。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创18.21.htm">18:21</a>）</p><p>这论及所多玛。</p><p>亚摩利人的罪恶还没有满盈。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.16.htm">15:16</a>）</p><p>在以下经文中，教会的终结还以主所说的“时代的末了”（consummation of the age）来表示: </p><p>门徒问耶稣，你降临和时代的末了有什么预兆呢？（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太 24.3.htm"> 24:3</a>）</p><p>当收割的时候，我要对收割的人说，先将稗子收集起来烧掉；惟有麦子要收在仓里；时代的末了也要如此。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.30.htm">13:30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.40.htm">40</a>）</p><p>在时代的末了，天使要出来，从义人中把恶人分别出来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.49.htm">13:49</a>）</p><p>耶稣对门徒们说，看哪，我与你们同在，直到时代的末了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.20.htm">28:20</a>）</p><p>“直到时代的末了”表示直到教会的终结，这时必有新的教会，主将与这新教会同在。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 658</h4><p>658. For in them the wrath of God is complete. This symbolizes the destruction of the church and its end then.<p>Its being complete symbolizes the destruction of the church and its end then, as explained below. The wrath of God symbolizes the evil in people, which, because it is in opposition to God, is called the wrath of God. Not that God is angry at people, but that people's evil causes them to be angry at God. Moreover, because, when a person is punished or tormented on account of his evil - as happens in hell after death - it seems to him that it is God's doing, therefore in the Word we find anger and wrath, even evil, attributed to God. But that is the case only in the literal sense, because that sense has been written in terms of appearances and correspondences; but not so in the spiritual sense, for that sense contains no appearance or correspondent imagery, but truth in its own light. For more on the wrath of God, see nos. <a href="525.htm">525</a>, <a href="635.htm">635</a> above.<p>This verse says that in the seven last plagues the wrath of God is complete, and we say that this symbolizes the destruction of the church and its end then. We need to explain why. The reason is that every church declines in the process of time as it turns away from the goodness of love and from truths of faith, until nothing is left of them, which is occasioned by gradually increasing evil and falsity. And then, when there is no longer any goodness of love and faith, there remains only evil and falsity, and when this is the case, the church is at an end. In this final state a person knows no better than to think that evil is good and that falsity is truth; for the delight he finds in them causes him to love evil and falsity and therefore to defend them.<p>This is the final state symbolized by an end, consummation or completion called a destruction in the following passages:<p>...I have heard from... Jehovah... a consummation and destruction upon the whole earth. (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a>)<p>A consummation is decreed, overflowing with righteousness. For the Lord, Jehovih of hosts, is making an end and destruction throughout the land. (<a href="3927/isaiah_10_22.htm">Isaiah 10:22-23</a>)<p>The whole land shall be devoured by the fire of (Jehovah's) zeal, for He will make speedy end of all those who dwell in the land. (<a href="3927/zephaniah_1_18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a>)<p>(At length) on the bird of abominations shall be desolation, even until the consummation and destruction shall it drop upon the devastation. (<a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>)<p>The whole land shall be a wasteland, yet I will not make an end. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_4_27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>)<p>(Jehovah said,) "I will go down... and see whether they have come to an end according to the outcry... that has come to Me." (<a href="3927/genesis_18_21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>)<p>The last said in regard to Sodom.<p>...the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete. (<a href="3927/genesis_15_16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>)<p>The church's end is also meant by the end of the age spoken of by the Lord in the following passages:<p>(The disciples asked Jesus,) "What will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?" (<a href="3927/matthew_24_3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>)<p>...at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, "First gather together the tares... to burn them. Gather the wheat into my barn. ...so it will be at the end of the age. (<a href="3927/matthew_13_30.htm">Matthew 13:30</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_13_40.htm">40</a>)<p>...at the end of the age... the angels will come forth and separate the wicked from among the just... (<a href="3927/matthew_13_49.htm">Matthew 13:49</a>)<p>(Jesus said to His disciples,) "Lo, I am with you... even to the end of the age." (<a href="3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>)<p>Even to the end of the age means to the end of the church, when there will be a new church with which the Lord will then be present. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 658</h4><p>658. 'For in them the wrath of God has been consummated' signifies the devastation of the Church and its end then. By the 'consummation' is signified the devastation of the Church, and its end then, concerning which [something] follows. By 'the wrath of God' is signified the evil with men which, because it is against God, is termed 'the wrath of God'; not that God is angry with man, but that a man by reason of his own evil is angry with God. And because it appears to the man while he is being punished and tormented on account of it, as is the case after death in hell, as if derived from God, therefore in the Word 'wrath' and 'growing anger,' even 'evil,' are attributed to God. This, however, [is done] in the sense of the letter, because that sense has been composed by means of appearances and correspondences, but not in the spiritual sense, for in this there is no appearance and correspondence, but the truth (veritas) in its own light. Concerning that 'wrath,' see above (<a href="525.htm">525</a>, <a href="635.htm">635</a>). It is said that in those plagues 'the wrath of God has been consummated' and that by this is signified the devastation of the Church, and its end then. The reason will be stated. Every Church in process of time decreases by receding from the good of love and from the truths of faith, even until there is not anything left of them, and this is effected by successive increases of evil and untruth. And when the good of love and faith no longer exists, then there is nothing but evil and untruth, and when this is the case it is the end of the Church. In this end a man knows no otherwise than that what is evil is good, and that what is untrue is true, for he loves them out of the delight thereof, and therefore confirms them.</p><p>[2] This is the end that is signified by 'consummation,' and is called 'devastation,' in the following passages:<p>I have heard a consummation and decision from with Jehovah upon the entire land. <a href="3927/isaiah_28_22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a>.<p>The consummation was decreed, justice overflowed, for the Lord Jehovih Zebaoth is making a consummation and decision in the whole land. <a href="3927/isaiah_10_22.htm">Isaiah 10:22-23</a>.<p>In the fire of Jehovah's zeal the whole land shall be eaten up, for He shall make a speedy consummation with all the inhabitants of the land, <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a>.<p>At length upon the bird of abominations [there shall be] desolation, and even to a consummation and decision shall it drop upon the devastation. <a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>.<p>The whole land shall be a waste, yet will I not make a consummation. <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>.<p>Jehovah said, I will go down and see whether, according to the cry that is come to Me, they have made a consummation. <a href="3927/genesis_18_21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>; this is concerning Sodom.<p>The iniquity of the Amorites has not yet been consummated. <a href="3927/genesis_15_16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>.<p>The end of the Church is also understood by 'the consummation of the age' by the Lord in these passages:<p>The disciples asked Jesus, What is the sign of Thy coming and of the consummation of the age? <a href="3927/matthew_24_3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>.<p>At the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather first the tares for burning; gather the wheat into the barn; so shall it be in the consummation of the age. <a href="3927/matthew_13_30.htm">Matthew 13:30</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_13_40.htm">40</a>.<p>In the consummation of the age, the angels shall go forth and separate the evil from among the just. <a href="3927/matthew_13_49.htm">Matthew 13:49</a>.<p>Jesus said to the disciples, Behold I am with you even until the consummation of the age. <a href="3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>.<p>'Until the consummation of the age' is until the end of the Church, when there is a New Church with which the Lord will then be. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 658</h4><p>658. For in them is consummated the anger of God, signifies the devastation of the church and then its end. By "consummation" is signified the devastation of the church and then its end, as will be seen presently; by "the anger of God" is signified evil with men, which, because it is against God, is called the anger of God; not that God is angry with man, but because man, from his evil, is angry with God, and because it appears to man, when he is punished and tormented for it, as is the case after death in hell, as if it were from God, therefore, in the Word, anger and wrath, yea evil, is attributed to God. But this in the sense of the letter only, because this sense is written according to appearances and correspondences, but not in the spiritual sense, for in this latter there is no appearance and correspondence, but truth in its light; concerning that wrath, see above, (<a href="525.htm">525</a>, <a href="635.htm">635</a>). It is said that in those plagues "the anger of God is consummated," and that thereby is signified the devastation of the church and then its end; the reason shall be explained. Every church, in process of time, decreases, by receding from the good of love and the truths of faith, until there is nothing of them left; and this takes place by the successive increase of evil and falsity; and when there is no longer any good of love and faith, then there is nothing but evil and falsity; and when this is the case, there is an end of the church. In this end, man knows no other than that evil is good and falsity truth, for he loves them from the delight he feels in them, and therefore confirms them.</p><p>[2] This is the end which is signified by "consummation," and is called "devastation," in the following passages:<p>I have heard a consummation and decision from Jehovah upon the whole earth, (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a>).<p>The consummation being decreed, justice has overflowed, for the Lord Jehovih of Hosts maketh a consummation and decision in the whole earth, (<a href="3927/isaiah_10_22.htm">Isaiah 10:22-23</a>).<p>In the fire of the zeal of Jehovah shall the whole earth be eaten up, for He shall make a speedy consummation with all the inhabitants of the earth, (<a href="3927/zephaniah_1_18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a>).<p>At length upon the bird of abominations there shall be desolation, and even to a consummation and decision shall it drop upon the devastation, (<a href="3927/daniel_9_27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>).<p>The whole earth shall be a waste, yet will I not make a consummation, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_4_27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>).<p>Jehovah said, I will go down, and will see whether they have made a consummation according to the cry which is to come unto me, (<a href="3927/genesis_18_21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>).<p>This is concerning Sodom.<p>The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet consummated, (<a href="3927/genesis_15_16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>).<p>The end of the church is also meant by "the consummation of the age" spoken of by the Lord in these passages:<p>The disciples asked Jesus, What shall be the sign of Thy coming and of the consummation of the age?
