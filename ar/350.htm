<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>350.启7:5.“犹大支派中受印的有一万二千”表属天之爱，也就是对主之爱，所有将要在新天堂和新教会的人都具有这爱。在至高意义上，“犹大”表示主的属天之爱；在属灵意义上，表示主的属天国度和圣言；在属世意义上，表示属天教会取自圣言的教义。不过，此处“犹大”表示属天之爱，就是对主之爱；在这个次序中，“犹大”因是第一个被提及，故表示所有将要属于主的新天堂和新教会之人所具有的属天之爱；第一个点名的支派是其余的里面的全部，如同他们的头，如同进入随后全部事物，并汇集、限定、影响它们的一种共性。这就是对主之爱。“一万二千”表示所有具有这爱的人（<a href="348.htm">348</a>节）。</p><p>人们知道，所罗门时代过后，以色列十二支派分成了犹大和以色列两个王国。犹大王国代表主的属天或祭司王国；以色列王国代表主的属灵国度或王权；然而，当属灵之物在后者当中丝毫不剩时，后者就被摧毁了；而犹大王国因着圣言而得以保存，因为主将在那里出生。但当他们完全亵渎圣言，因而不认识主时，其王国随之被摧毁。由此明显可知，“犹大支派”表示属天之爱，也就是对主之爱；但他们如此对待圣言和主，故“犹大支派”也表示对立的爱，也就是自我之爱，确切地说，是源于自我之爱的统治之爱，这爱就是所谓鬼魔的爱欲。</p><p>“犹大”及其支派表示属天国度及其爱，也就是对主之爱。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>犹大啊，你弟兄们必赞美你，权杖必不离犹大，直等细罗来到，万民都要归顺他；犹大把驴驹拴在葡萄树上，把母驴的崽子拴在美好的葡萄树上；他在葡萄酒中洗了衣服；他的眼睛必因酒红润；他的牙齿必因奶洁白。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.8.htm">49:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>大卫必永远作他们的王；并且我要与他们立平安的约，作为与他们的永约；我要在他们中间设立我的圣所，直到永远。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.26.htm">37:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.27.htm">27</a>）</p><p>锡安的女子啊，应当欢呼快乐；耶和华必使犹大成为祂自己的产业，作祂圣地的分。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.10.htm">2:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>犹大啊，可以守你的节期，还你所许的愿吧！因为那恶魔不再从你中间经过；人都已被剪除净尽了。（那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿1.15.htm">1:15</a>）</p><p>主必忽然进入祂的殿；那时，犹大和耶路撒冷所献的供物必蒙耶和华悦纳，仿佛古时之日。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.1.htm">3:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.4.htm">4</a>）</p><p>犹大必存到永远，耶路撒冷必存到代代。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.20.htm">3:20</a>）</p><p>看哪，日子将到，我要给大卫兴起一个公义的苗裔；在祂的日子里，犹大必得救。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.5.htm">23:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>我必从雅各领出种，从犹大中领出承受我众山的，选民必承受它。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.9.htm">65:9</a>）</p><p>犹大为祂的圣所、以色列为祂所统治的国。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗114.2.htm">114:2</a>）</p><p>看哪，日子将到，我要与犹大家另立新约；所立的约乃是这样，我要在他们中间给予我的律法，将它写在他们心上。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.31.htm">31:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.33.htm">33</a>）</p><p>在那些日子，必有十个人拉住一个人，一个犹大人的衣襟，说，我们要与你们同去，因为我们听见神与你们同在了。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.23.htm">8:23</a>）</p><p>我所要造的新天新地怎样在我面前长存，你们的各和你们的名字也照样长存；各民族的王必作你的养父，他们的王后必作你的乳母；他们必将脸伏于地，向你下拜，并舔你脚上的尘土。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.22.htm">66:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.23.htm">49:23</a>）</p><p>从这些以及许多其它经文（为数太多，不一一引用）明显可知，“犹大”不是指犹大，而是指教会；如，主将与这个民族订立一个新的永约，使他们成为祂的产业和圣所，直到永远；“列邦的王及其王后必向他们下拜，舔他们脚上的尘土”，诸如此类。</p><p>就其本身而言，“犹大支派”是指属出于自我之爱的统治之爱的鬼魔的国度。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>我要向他们掩面，看他们的结局如何。这本是极乖僻的一代，心中无诚实的儿女；他们是不听劝告的民族；他们的葡萄树是所多玛的葡萄树，蛾摩拉田园所生的；它的葡萄是苦毒的葡萄，全挂都是苦的；他们的酒是大蛇的毒气，是虺蛇残害的恶毒；这不都是贮藏在我这里，密封在我府库中吗？（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.20.htm">32:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.34.htm">34</a>）</p><p>你当知道，耶和华赐下迦南地，并不是因你的义，也不是因你心里正直，你本是硬着颈项的百姓。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申9.5.htm">9:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申9.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>犹大啊，你神的数目与你城的数目相等；你为那可耻的巴力所筑烧香的坛，也与耶路撒冷街道的数目相等。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.28.htm">2:28</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶11.13.htm">11:13</a>）</p><p>你们是出于你们的父魔鬼，你们父的私欲，你们偏要行。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.44.htm">8:44</a>）</p><p>经上说他们装满了假善、不法的事和污秽。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.27.htm">23:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.28.htm">28</a>）</p><p>一个淫乱的世代。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.39.htm">12:39</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可8.38.htm">8:38</a>）</p><p>耶路撒冷，就是他们所居之地，被称为“所多玛”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.9.htm">3:9</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.14.htm">23:14</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.46.htm">16:46</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.48.htm">48</a>；启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.8.htm">11:8</a>）。此外还有其它地方声称这个民族已全然毁坏，耶路撒冷要被摧毁（如耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.1.htm">5:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.6.htm">6:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.7.htm">7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.17.htm">7:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.18.htm">18</a>等；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.6.htm">8:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.8.htm">8</a>等；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.10.htm">9:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.13.htm">13</a>等；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.9.htm">13:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.14.htm">14</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.16.htm">14:16</a>；耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.8.htm">1:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.17.htm">17</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.1.htm">4:1</a>至末尾；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结5.5.htm">5:5</a>至末尾；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.18.htm">12:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.19.htm">19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结15.6.htm">15:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结15.8.htm">8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.1.htm">16:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.63.htm">63</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.1.htm">23:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.49.htm">49</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 350</h4><p>350. Of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed. (<a href="3927/revelation_7_5.htm">7:5</a>) This symbolizes celestial love, which is love toward the Lord, and this in all those people who will be in the Lord's New Heaven and New Church.<p>In the highest sense Judah symbolizes the Lord in relation to celestial love; in the spiritual sense, the Lord's celestial kingdom and the Word; and in the natural sense, the doctrine of a celestial church drawn from the Word. Here, however, Judah symbolizes celestial love, which is love toward the Lord; and because it is named first in the series, it symbolizes that love in all those people who will be in the New Heaven and in the Lord's New Church. For the tribe named first is everything in the rest, being to them as though their head and serving as a universal property entering into all those that follow, tying them together, qualifying them and affecting them. This property is love toward the Lord.<p>To be shown that twelve thousand symbolizes all who possess that love, see no. <a href="348.htm">348</a> above.</p><p>[2] People know that after the death of Solomon the twelve tribes of Israel were divided into two kingdoms: the kingdom of Judah and the kingdom of Israel. The kingdom of Judah represented the celestial kingdom or the Lord's priestly kingdom, while the kingdom of Israel represented the spiritual kingdom or the Lord's royal kingdom. But the latter was destroyed when the people had nothing spiritual left in them, whereas the kingdom of Judah was preserved, for the sake of the Word, and because the Lord would be born there. However, when the people adulterated the Word completely, and thus could not recognize the Lord, then their kingdom was destroyed.<p>It can be seen from this that the tribe of Judah symbolizes celestial love, which is love toward the Lord. But because the people were of the character they were with respect to the Word and with respect to the Lord, the tribe of Judah symbolizes also the opposite love, which is love of self - properly speaking, a love of dominating springing from a love of self - a love which we call diabolical love.</p><p>[3] The fact that Judah and his tribe symbolize the celestial kingdom and its love, which is love toward the Lord, follows from these passages:<p>Judah, your brothers shall praise you... The scepter shall not be taken from Judah... until Shiloh comes; and to Him shall be the obedience of the people. Binding his donkey's foal to the vine, his donkey's colt to the choice vine, he washes his garment in wine... His eyes are redder than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk. (<a href="3927/genesis_49_8.htm">Genesis 49:8-12</a>)<p>...David shall be their prince forever, and I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them..., and I will set My sanctuary in their midst forevermore. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25-26</a>)<p>Exult and rejoice, O daughter of Zion! ...Jehovah will make Judah an inheritance for Himself, His portion on the holy land. (<a href="3927/zechariah_2_10.htm">Zechariah 2:10-12</a>)<p>O Judah, celebrate your feasts, perform your vows. For Belial <sup>1</sup>shall no more pass through you; he is utterly cut off. (<a href="3927/nahum_1_15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>)<p>The Lord... will suddenly come to His temple... Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be sweet to Jehovah as in the days of old... (<a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, <a href="3927/malachi_3_4.htm">4</a>)<p>Judah shall abide forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. (<a href="3927/joel_3_20.htm">Joel 3:20</a>)<p>Behold, the days are coming..., that I will raise to David a righteous Branch... In His days Judah will be saved... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>)<p>I will bring forth offspring from Jacob, and from Judah an heir of My mountains, that My elect may possess it... (<a href="3927/isaiah_65_9.htm">Isaiah 65:9</a>)<p>Judah became His sanctuary, and Israel His dominion. (<a href="3927/psalms_114_2.htm">Psalms 114:2</a>)<p>Behold, the days are coming..., when I will make a new covenant... with the house of Judah... ...this will be the covenant...: I will put My law within them, and write it on their heart... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_27.htm">Jeremiah 31:27</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">33-34</a>)<p>In those days ten men... shall grasp the sleeve of a Jewish man, saying, "We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you." (<a href="3927/zechariah_8_23.htm">Zechariah 8:23</a>)<p>...as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make shall remain before Me..., so shall your offspring and your name remain.<p>Kings (of the nations) shall be your foster fathers, their princesses your nursing mothers. They shall bow down to you, their faces to the ground, and lick the dust of your feet. (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_49_23.htm">49:23</a>)</p><p>[4] From these and many other passages, which we do not have the space to cite because of their number, it can be clearly seen that Judah means not Judah but the church. We are told, for example, that the Lord would make a new and eternal covenant with that nation, that He would make it His heir and His sanctuary forevermore, and that kings of the nations and their princesses would bow down to them, licking the dust of their feet, and so on.</p><p>[5] That the tribe of Judah, regarded in itself, means the diabolic kingdom, which is one of a love of dominating springing from a love of self, can be seen from the following passages:<p>I will hide My face from them, I will see what their posterity will be. ...they are a perverse generation, children in whom is no faith... ...they are a nation void of counsel... ...their vine is of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah; its grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter. Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps. Is this not laid up in store with Me, sealed up in My treasuries? (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_20.htm">Deuteronomy 32:20-34</a>)<p>(Know that) it is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart... that Jehovah... is... giving you (the land of Canaan)..., for you are a stiff-necked people. (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_9_5.htm">Deuteronomy 9:5-6</a>)<p>...according to the number of your cities have been your gods, O Judah... ...according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars... to burn incense to Baal. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_2_28.htm">Jeremiah 2:28</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_11_13.htm">11:13</a>)<p>You are of your father the devil, and you choose to do the desires of your father. (<a href="3927/john_8_44.htm">John 8:44</a>)<p>Jews are said to be full of hypocrisy, iniquity, and uncleanness (<a href="3927/matthew_23_27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In the Old Testament, the personification of wickedness and destruction, originally conceived perhaps as some sort of spirit demon. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 350</h4><p>350. [verse 5] 'Out of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand sealed' signifies celestial love, which is love directed to the Lord, and this with all who will be in the New Heaven and in the Lord's New Church. By 'Judah' in the highest sense is signified the Lord as to celestial love, in the spiritual sense the Lord's celestial kingdom, also the Word, and in the natural sense the celestial doctrine of the Church out of the Word. Here, however, by 'Judah' is signified the celestial love that is love directed to the Lord; and because it is named first in the series, it signifies that love with all who will be in the New Heaven and in the Lord's New Church; for the tribe named in the first place is everything in the rest. It is as a head to them; and, as a universal entering into all the things that follow, it gathers, qualifies and modifies (afficere) them. This is love directed to the Lord. That 'twelve thousand' signify all who are in that love may be seen above (<a href="348.htm">348</a>).</p><p>[2] It is well known that the twelve tribes of Israel were, after [the time of] Solomon, divided into two kingdoms, the Jewish and the Israelitish. The Jewish kingdom used to represent the celestial kingdom, or the Lord's Priesthood, and the Israelitish kingdom the spiritual kingdom, or the Lord's Royalty. The latter, however, was destroyed when there was not anything spiritual remaining with them; but the Jewish kingdom was preserved on account of the Word, and because the Lord would be born there. When, however, they had altogether adulterated the Word, and so were not able to get to know (cognoscere) the Lord, then their kingdom was destroyed. From these considerations it can be established that by 'the tribe of Judah' is signified the celestial love that is love directed to the Lord; but because as regards the Lord and the Word they were such [as described above], by 'the tribe of Judah' is also signified the opposite love, which is the love of self, properly the love of domineering derived from the love of self which love is called diabolical love.</p><p>[3] That by 'Judah' and his tribe is signified the celestial kingdom and its love, which is love directed to the Lord, is established from these passages:<p>Judah, thy brethren shall celebrate thee; the sceptre shall not be removed from Judah until Shiloh come, and there is an adhering of the peoples to him; he binds his little she-ass to the vine, and his ass's colt to the choice vine; he washes his garment in wine; with eyes red from wine, and teeth white from milk. <a href="3927/genesis_49_8.htm">Genesis 49:8-12</a>.<p>David shall be a prince for them to eternity, and I will make a covenant of peace with them, it shall be a covenant of eternity with them, and I will set the sanctuary in the midst of them for ever. <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25-26</a>.<p>Shout and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; Jehovah shall make Judah an inheritance for Himself His portion upon the land of holiness, <a href="3927/zechariah_2_10.htm">Zechariah 2:10-12</a> [H.B. 14-16]<p>O Judah, keep thy festivals, perform thy vows, because never again shall belial <sup>1</sup>pass through thee, every one shall be cut off, <a href="3927/nahum_1_15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/nahum_2_1.htm">2:1</a>]<p>The Lord shall suddenly come to His temple, then shall the minchah <sup>2</sup>of Judah and Jerusalem be sweet according to the days of an age, <a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3</a>:[<a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">1</a>], <a href="3927/malachi_3_4.htm">4</a>.<p>Judah shall remain seated for ever, and Jerusalem unto generation and generation. <a href="3927/joel_3_18.htm">Joel 3:18-20</a> [H.B 4:18-20].<p>Behold the days shall come when I will raise up unto David a just offshoot; in His days shall Judah be saved. <a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>.<p>I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah the heir of My mountains, that the chosen may possess it. <a href="3927/isaiah_65_9.htm">Isaiah 65:9</a>.<p>Judah was made into His sanctuary, and Israel into His dominions. <a href="3927/psalms_114_2.htm">Psalms 114:2</a>.<p>Behold the days shall come in which I will make a new covenant with the house of Judah; this shall be the covenant, I will give My law in the midst of them, and write it upon their heart. <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_27.htm">Jeremiah 31:27</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_31.htm">31</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">33-34</a>.<p>In those days shall ten men take hold of the skirt of a man that is a Judaean, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard God is with you, <a href="3927/zechariah_8_22.htm">Zechariah 8:22-23</a>.<p>As the new heavens and the new land that I am going to make shall stand before Me, so shall your seed and your name stand. <a href="3927/isaiah_66_20.htm">Isaiah 66:20</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_66_22.htm">22</a>.<p>The kings of the nations shall be thy nourishers (nutritii), their princes [thy] wet nurses (lactatrices); they shall bow down their faces to thee upon the land, and lick the dust of thy feet. <a href="3927/isaiah_49_22.htm">Isaiah 49:22-23</a>.</p><p>[4] From these and many other passages, which there is not time to quote because of their abundance, it can be manifestly established that by 'Judah' it is not Judah but the Church that is understood; as that the Lord is going to make a new and eternal covenant with that nation, to make them His heir, and His sanctuary for ever, while the kings of the nations and their princes are going to bow themselves down to them, licking the dust of the feet thereof, besides more.</p><p>[5] That by 'the tribe of Judah' regarded in itself is understood the diabolical kingdom, which is the love of domineering out of the love of self, can be established from these passages:<p>I will hide My faces from them, I will see what their posterity will be; they are a generation of perversity, sons in whom there is no fidelity; they are a nation devoid of counsel; their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah, its grapes are grapes of gall, clusters of bitternesses to them; their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps: is not <sup>3</sup>this hidden with Me, sealed up in My treasures?

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 350</h4><p>350. Verse 5. (<a href="3927/revelation_7_5.htm">Revelation 7:5</a>) Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand, signifies celestial love, which is love to the Lord, and this with all who will be in the Lord's New Heaven and New Church. By "Judah," in the highest sense, is signified the Lord as to celestial love; in the spiritual sense, the Lord's celestial kingdom and the Word; and in the natural sense, the doctrine of the celestial church from the Word. But here by "Judah" is signified celestial love, which is love to the Lord; and because it is mentioned first in the series, it signifies that love with all who will be of the Lord's New Heaven and New Church; for the tribe first named is the all in the rest, it is as their head, and as a universal entering into all things that follow, collecting, qualifying, and affecting them. Such is love to the Lord. That "twelve thousand" signify all who are in that love, may be seen above, (<a href="348.htm">348</a>).</p><p>[2] It is known that the twelve tribes of Israel, after Solomon's time, were divided into two kingdoms, the Jewish and Israelitish. The Jewish kingdom represented the Lord's celestial or priestly kingdom; and the Israelitish kingdom, the Lord's spiritual kingdom or royalty; the latter, however, was destroyed when there was nothing spiritual left among them; but the Jewish kingdom was preserved, on account of the Word, and because the Lord was to be born there. But when they had wholly adulterated the Word, and thus they could not know the Lord, then their kingdom was destroyed. From hence it may appear, that by "the tribe of Judah" is signified celestial love, which is love to the Lord; but because they were such as to the Word, and as to the Lord, therefore by "the tribe of Judah" is also signified the opposite love, which is the love of self, properly the love of dominion from the love of self, which love is called diabolical love.</p><p>[3] That by "Judah" and his tribe is signified the celestial kingdom and its love, which is love to the Lord is evident from these passages:<p>Judah, thy brethren shall praise thee, the scepter shall not be removed from Judah until Shiloh come, and unto him is the adherence of the people; he bindeth his foal to the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washeth his garment in wine; his eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk, (<a href="3927/genesis_49_8.htm">Genesis 49:8-12</a>).<p>David shall be their prince forever; and I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be a covenant of eternity with them; and I will set My sanctuary in the midst of them for ever, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26-27</a>).<p>Shout and be glad, O daughter of Zion; Jehovah will make Judah an inheritance to Himself, His portion upon the land of holiness, (<a href="3927/zechariah_2_10.htm">Zechariah 2:10-12</a>).<p>O Judah, keep thy festivals, perform thy vows, because Belial shall no more pass through thee; everyone shall be cut off, (<a href="3927/nahum_1_15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>).<p>The Lord shall suddenly come to His temple; then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah as in the days of old, (<a href="3927/matthew_3_1.htm">Matthew 3:1-4</a>).<p>Judah shall sit to eternity, and Jerusalem unto generation and generation, (<a href="3927/joel_3_20.htm">Joel 3:20</a>).<p>Behold, the days shall come, when I will raise up unto David a just offshoot; in His days Judah shall be saved, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>).<p>I will bring forth a seed from Jacob, and from Judah an inheritor of my mountains, that the elect may possess it, (<a href="3927/isaiah_65_9.htm">Isaiah 65:9</a>).<p>Judah was His sanctuary, and Israel His dominions, (<a href="3927/psalms_114_2.htm">Psalms 114:2</a>).<p>Behold, the days shall come, in which I will make a new covenant with the house of Judah; this shall be the covenant, I will give My law in the midst of them, and write it upon their heart, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">33</a>).<p>In those days shall ten men take hold of the skirt of a man, a Jew, saying, we will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you, (<a href="3927/zechariah_8_23.htm">Zechariah 8:23</a>).<p>As the new heavens and the new earth which I will make shall stand before Me, so shall stand your seed and your name;

<a href="3927/isaiah_49_23.htm">49:23</a>).</p><p>[4] From these and many other passages, too numerous to be adduced, it is very evident that by "Judah" is not meant Judah, but the church; as that the Lord would enter into a new and eternal covenant with that nation, and make them His inheritance and His sanctuary to eternity; and that the "kings of the Gentiles and their princes would bow themselves down to them, licking the dust of their feet," and such like.</p><p>[5] That by "the tribe of Judah," regarded in itself is meant the diabolical kingdom which is of the love of dominion from the love of self, may appear from these passages:<p>I will hide My face from them, I will see what their latter end will be; it is a generation of perverseness, sons in whom there is no fidelity; a nation void of counsel are they; their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah; its grapes are grapes of gall, clusters of bitterness are theirs; their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps; is this not <sup>1</sup>hidden with me, sealed up in my treasures, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_32_20.htm">Deuteronomy 32:20-34</a>)?<p>Know that not for thy justice and the uprightness of thy heart doth Jehovah give the land of Canaan, for thou art a people of stiff neck, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_9_5.htm">Deuteronomy 9:5-6</a>).<p>According to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah;

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 350 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>350. (Vers. 5.) "Ex Tribu Jehudae duodecim millia signati," significat amorem caelestem, qui est amor in Dominum, et hunc apud omnes qui in Novo Caelo et in Nova Ecclesia Domini erunt. -Per "Jehudam" in supremo Sensu significatur Dominus quoad amorem caelestem; in Sensu spirituali Regnum caeleste Domini, et Verbum; et in Sensu naturali Doctrina Ecclesiae caelestis e Verbo: hic autem per "Jehudam" significatur Amor caelestis, qui est Amor in Dominum; et quia primum in serie nominatur, significatur ille Amor apud omnes qui in Novo Caelo et in Nova Ecclesia Domini erunt: Tribus enim primo loco nominata est omne in reliquis; est sicut caput illis, et sicut universale intrans in omnia quae sequuntur, illa colligat, qualificat et afficit: hoc est Amor in Dominum. Quod "duodecim millia" significent omnes qui in illo Amore sunt, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_350/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348" target=_top>348</a>). Notum est, quod duodecim Tribus Israelis post Salomonem divisae fuerint in duo Regna, Judaicum et Israeliticum; Regnum Judaicum repraesentabat Regnum Caeleste, seu Sacerdotale Domini, et Regnum Israeliticum Regnum Spirituale, seu Regium Domini: sed hoc destructum fuit, dum apud illos non aliquod spirituale superesset; at Regnum Judaicum conservatum est, propter Verbum, et quia Dominus ibi nasceretur: sed cum Verbum prorsus adulteraverunt, et sic Dominum non potuerunt cognoscere, tunc Regnum illorum destructum fuit. Ex his constare potest, quod per "Tribum Jehudae" significetur Amor caelestis, qui est Amor in Dominum; sed quia tales fuerunt quoad Verbum et quoad Dominum, per "Tribum Jehudae" etiam significatur amor oppositus, qui est amor sui, proprie amor dominandi ex amore sui, qui amor vocatur amor diabolicus. Quod per "Jehudam" et ejus Tribum significetur Regnum caeleste et ejus Amor, qui est Amor in Dominum, constat ex his locis: <p>"Jehudah, te celebrabunt fratres tu; non removebitur sceptrum a Jehudah, usque dum venit Schilo, et ei adhaesio populorum: alligat ad vitem asellum suum, ad vitem praestantem filium asinae suae;
