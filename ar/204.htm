<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第204节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>204.“你既如温水，也不冷也不热，所以我必从我口中把你吐出去”表亵渎，随之与主分离。“从我口中把你吐出去”表与主分离，与主分离就是既不在天堂，也不在地狱，而是在一个隔开的地方，丧失了人的生命，那里只有纯粹的幻觉。原因在于，他们将真理与虚假，良善与邪恶，因而将神圣之物与亵渎之物混在了一起，以致它们无法分离。这时，人既不能为天堂，也不能为地狱做好预备，其整个理性生命完全被摧毁，只剩下生命的最表层。当脱离生命的内在时，生命的最表层纯粹是幻觉。关于他们的状态和命运，可参看《圣治》（<a href="../dp/226.htm">226</a>-228，<a href="../dp/231.htm">231</a>节）一书，这本书足以使人了解它们。经上之所以说他们要被吐出来，是因为介于天堂与地狱之间的灵人界对应于胃，而每个人死后首先进入灵人界，在那里作好预备。所有食物都在胃里预备要么转化为血肉，要么转化为粪尿。前者对应于天堂，后者对应于地狱。从胃中被吐出来的东西，是未被分离的混合物。由于这种对应关系，在以下经文中，经上也用“吐”和“呕吐物”这样的表述：</p><p>给人酒喝，使他喝醉，显出是未受割礼的；耶和华的杯必传到你那里，可耻的呕吐物必吐在荣耀上。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.15.htm">2:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.16.htm">16</a>）</p><p>你们要使摩押沉醉，因他要在自己所吐之中打滚。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.26.htm">48:26</a>）</p><p>各席上满了呕吐的污秽，无一处干净；他要将知识指教谁呢？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.8.htm">28:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>此外还有其它经文（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.27.htm">25:27</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利18.24.htm">18:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利18.25.htm">25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利18.28.htm">28</a>）。温水激起呕吐，这也是出于对应。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 204</h4><p>204. "'So then, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, it shall come to pass that I vomit you out of My mouth.'" (<a href="3927/revelation_3_16.htm">3:16</a>) This symbolizes their profanation and consequent separation from the Lord.<p>To be vomited out of My mouth means, symbolically, to be separated from the Lord, and to be separated from the Lord is consequently to be in neither heaven nor hell, but in a place apart, bereft of human life, surrounded by nothing but hallucinations. The reason is that they have mixed truths with falsities, and goods with evils, thus holy things with profane ones, to the point that these cannot be separated in them. And because a person cannot be prepared then to be in either heaven or hell, every bit of his rational life is eradicated, with only the lowest capacities of his life remaining, and when these have been separated from his life's interior capacities, they are nothing but hallucinations.<p>For more on the state and lot of such people, see Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Providence, nos. <a href="../dp/226.htm">226-228</a> <a href="../dp/231.htm">231</a>, which should suffice to give a concept of them.<p>They are said to be vomited out because after death everyone comes first into the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, and is there prepared; and this world corresponds to the stomach, in which everything ingested is prepared, either to become blood and flesh or to become excrement and urine. The first have a correspondence with heaven, the latter with hell. But whatever is vomited out of the stomach is matter not separated, but mixed together.<p>Because of this correspondence we find vomiting out and vomit mentioned in the following passages:<p>(Drink and make drunk) that your uncircumcised foreskin may be exposed. The cup... of Jehovah will come around to you, so that a disgraceful vomit is upon your glory. (<a href="3927/habakkuk_2_15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15-16</a>)<p>Make (Moab) drunk..., that (he) may applaud in his vomit... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_48_26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>)<p>...all tables are full of vomit thrown up... To whom will he teach knowledge? (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_8.htm">Isaiah 28:8-9</a>)<p>So, too, elsewhere, as in <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_27.htm">Jeremiah 25:27</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_18_24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-25</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_18_28.htm">28</a>.<p>The reason lukewarm water induces vomiting is owing also to the correspondence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 204</h4><p>204. [verse 16] 'So because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am going to spew thee out of My mouth' signifies profanation, and thereby separation from the Lord. By 'spew out of My mouth' is signified to be separated from the Lord, and to be so separated from the Lord is to be neither in heaven nor in hell, but in a place apart, deprived of human life, where there are nothing but phantasies. This is because they have mixed up truths with untruths and goods with evils, thus things holy with things profane, to such an extent that they cannot be separated. And since a man cannot then undergo preparation to be either in heaven or in hell, everything of his rational life is torn out, leaving the ultimates of life, which, separated from the interiors of life, are nothing but phantasies. More [details] about the condition and lot of these may be seen in <a href="../dp/226.htm">ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE PROVIDENCE 226-228</a>, <a href="../dp/231.htm">231</a>, which are sufficient for acquiring knowledge about them. It is said of these that they are 'spewed out,' because the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell where every man first comes and undergoes preparation after death, corresponds to the stomach. In this all things put in undergo preparation either to become blood and flesh, or to become excrement and urine, the latter having correspondence with hell, but the former with heaven. But the things that are spewed out of the stomach are those that have not been separated, but are mixed together. On account of this correspondence 'to be spewed out' and 'spewing' are mentioned in the following places:<p>Drink and be drunken, that thy foreskin may be uncovered: the cup of Jehovah shall come round to thee that there may be shameful spewing on the glory, <a href="3927/habakkuk_3_15.htm">Habakkuk 3:15-16</a>.<p>Make Moab drunken, that he may applaud in his vomit. <a href="3927/jeremiah_48_26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>.<p>All the tables are full of the vomit of emptying. Whom shall he teach knowledge? <a href="3927/isaiah_28_7.htm">Isaiah 28:7-9</a>, besides elsewhere, as <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_27.htm">Jeremiah 25:27</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_18_24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-25</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_18_28.htm">28</a>. That lukewarm water excites vomiting also results from correspondence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 204</h4><p>204. Verse 16. Therefore because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit thee out of My mouth, signifies profanation and consequent separation from the Lord. "To vomit out of My mouth," signifies to be separated from the Lord, and to be so separated from the Lord is to be neither in heaven nor in hell, but in a place apart, deprived of human life, where there are mere phantasies. The reason is, because they have mixed truths with falsities, and goods with evils, thus holy things with profane, even so that they cannot be separated. And since man cannot then be prepared, either to be in heaven or in hell, the whole of his rational life is destroyed, and the ultimates of life alone remain, which, when separated from the interiors of life, are mere phantasies. Concerning their state and lot more may be seen in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Providence, (<a href="226.htm">226-228</a>, <a href="231.htm">231</a>), which will suffice to give a knowledge of them. It is said of them that "they are vomited out," because the world of spirits, which is in the midst between heaven and hell, and into which every man first comes after death, and is there prepared, corresponds to the stomach, in which all the things put in are prepared either to become blood and flesh, or to become excrement and urine, the latter having a correspondence with hell, but the former with heaven. But the things that are vomited out of the stomach are those that have not been separated, but remain commixed. By reason of this correspondence, the expression "to vomit" and "vomit" are used in the following passages:<p>Drink and be drunken, and let thy foreskin be uncovered; and the cup of Jehovah shall go around unto thee, and the shameful vomiting shall be upon the glory, (<a href="3927/habakkuk_2_15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15-16</a>).<p>Make Moab drunken, that he may clap the hands in his vomit, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_48_26.htm">Jeremiah 48:26</a>).<p>All tables are full of the vomit of emptying; what one shall he teach knowledge? (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_8.htm">Isaiah 28:8-9</a>).<p>Besides other places (as <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_27.htm">Jeremiah 25:27</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_18_24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-25</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_18_28.htm">28</a>). That warm water excites vomiting, is also from correspondence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 204 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>204. (Vers. 16.) "Itaque quia tepidus es, et non frigidus nec calidus, futurum est ut te evomam ex ore Meo," significat prophanationem, et inde separationem a Domino. - Per "evomi ex ore Meo" significatur Separari a Domino, et sic separari a Domino est non esse in Caelo nec in Inferno, sed in loco separato, orbati vita humana, ubi sunt merae phantasiae; causa est, quia commiscuerunt vera falsis et bona malis, ita sancta prophanis, usque ut non Separari possint; et quia homo tunc non praeparari potest, ut sit vel in Caelo vel in Inferno, eruitur omne vitae rationalis ejus, remanentibus vitae ultimis, quae separata a vitae interioribus sunt mere phantasiae. De horum statu et sorte videantur plura in Sapientia Angelica de <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_204/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_226" target=_top>Divina Providentia 226-228</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_204/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_231" target=_top>231</a>, quae pro de illis sufficiunt. Dicitur de his quod cognitione evomantur," quia Mundus spirituum, qui est medius inter Caelum et Infernum, in quem omnis homo primum post mortem venit, et ibi praeparatur, correspondet Ventriculo, in quo omnia ingesta praeparantur, ut vel fiant sanguis et caro, vel ut fiant excrementa et urinae; haec habent correspondentiam cum Inferno, illa autem cum Caelo; at quae evomuntur ex Ventriculo, sunt quae non separata sunt, sed commixta. Propter hanc correspondentiam dicitur "evomi" et "vomitus" in sequentibus locis: <p>"Bibe et inebriare, ut praeputium tuum reveletur; circumibit ad te calix Jehovae, ut Vomitus ignominiosus sit super gloria," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_204/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_habakkuk_2_15" target=_top>Habakuk 2:15</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_204/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_habakkuk_2_10" target=_top>10</a>);<p>"Inebriate Moabum, ut complodat in Vomitu suo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_204/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_48_26" target=_top>Jeremias 48:26</a>);<p>"Omnes mensae sunt plenae Vomitu egestionis; quem nam docebit scientiam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_204/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_28_8-9" target=_top>Esaias 28:8-9</a>). <sup>1</sup><p>(Praeter alibi, ut <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_204/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_25_27" target=_top>Jeremias 25:27</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_204/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_18_24-25" target=_top>Leviticus 18:24-25</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_204/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_18_28" target=_top>28</a>). <p>Quod aqua tepida ciat vomitum, est quoque ex correspondentia.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;8, 9 pro "7, 8" </p>
