<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第816节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>816.启19:9.“天使对我说，你要写上，凡被请赴羔羊之婚筵的有福了”表从天上差给约翰的天使，与他谈论主的新教会，声称世间将得以知道，那些接受属新教会的事物之人拥有永生。正是从天上差给约翰的天使跟他说这些事，这一点从下一节明显看出来，即：约翰俯伏在他脚前要拜他；而这位天使则回应说，他与约翰同是作仆人的；所以当拜的是神，不是他。约翰先前所听到的来自天堂本身，是许多天使通过主一起说的，这一点从之前的5-7节经文很明显地看出来；那里说“有声音从宝座出来”，因而听上去“好像一大群人的声音，像众水的声音，又像大雷的声音”，论到他们，经上说“我们要欢喜快乐”。这些用的都是复数，但现在用的是单数，因而差给约翰的是一位天使。</p><p>不过，我要说明天使与世人说话时是何情形。他们从未从天上与他说话，从天上所听到的声音是由主那里经由天堂而来的。不过，当天使蒙允许与某个人说话时，他们便从自己的社群当中差遣一个离此人很近的一位天使；他们通过这位天使与此人说话。被差遣的这一位便是众多天使的主体或渠道，现在与约翰说话的，正是这样的一个主体或渠道。这样做是为了能在世上宣告：整个天堂皆承认，唯独主是天上的神，唯独祂当受崇拜；还有，主将在地上，如在众天堂那样建立新教会；因为主首先在众天堂建立一个教会，然后通过天堂在地上建立。这就是这些话所蕴含的奥秘。</p><p>现在解释一下。“写”表示叫他能将这一切传给后世子孙，以作纪念（<a href="39.htm">39</a>，<a href="63.htm">63</a>，<a href="639.htm">639</a>节）；在此表示叫他能使这些事为人所知；这一点以“写”来表示。“凡被请赴羔羊之婚筵的有福了”表示那些接受属新教会事物的人拥有永生；经上称拥有永生的人是“有福”的（<a href="639.htm">639</a>节）；“羔羊之婚筵”表示新教会，它与主结合，如前所述（<a href="812.htm">812</a>节）；“被请的”是指所有接受者（<a href="744.htm">744</a>节）；事实上，所有人都被请或呼召了；但那些不接受的人拒绝这种呼召。</p><p>至于被称为“羔羊之婚筵”，是因为这事是在教会的末后状态下发生的，这种末后状态被称为“晚上”或傍晚；晚餐在晚上举行。但新教会的初始状态被称为“早晨”。“晚上”人被呼召到教会；当被召的人出现时，“早晨”便来临。教会的末后状态被称为“晚上”和“夜间”（evening和night），教会的初始状态被称为“黎明”和“早晨”（参看<a href="151.htm">151</a>节）。当主前往耶路撒冷受难时，正是犹太教会的末后状态，也就是晚上，因此那时主与门徒共进晚餐并设立圣餐；这就是它被称为圣餐的由来；若悔改后直接靠近主的话，通过圣餐还能实现主与教会之人的结合，或婚姻；否则，只有实现临在，而非结合。由此明显可知在圣言的其它地方，“晚餐”和“进晚餐”表示什么。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 816</h4><p>816. <a href="3927/revelation_19_9.htm">19:9</a> Then he said to me, "Write: 'Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb!'" This symbolizes a single angel sent from heaven to John and speaking with him about the Lord's New Church, saying that it was granted people on earth to know that those have eternal life who accept the teachings that are the teachings of that church.<p>That it was a single angel sent from heaven to John who spoke with him can be seen from the following verse, which says that John fell at his feet to worship him, and that the angel replied that he was his fellow servant; therefore that not he but God should be worshiped.<p>The first speech that John heard came from heaven itself and was uttered by many angels speaking in unison from the Lord, as is clearly apparent from the preceding verses 5, 6, and 7, where we are told that the voice came from the throne, and that it sounded like the voice of a great multitude, and like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of mighty thunderings, saying, "Let us be glad and rejoice." That was said in the plural, but this now in the singular, thus by a single angel sent to John.</p><p>[2] But let me say how the case is when angels speak with a person. They never speak with him from heaven, but any voice heard coming from there comes from the Lord through heaven. However, when angels are granted to speak with a person, they send someone from their society who is close to the person and speak with the person through him. The one sent is the instrument of many. And that is what the one was who now spoke with John. This took place in order that it might be proclaimed on earth that the whole of heaven acknowledges the Lord alone as God of heaven, that He alone is to be worshiped, and that the Lord was about to establish a new church on earth, as it had been in the heavens. For the Lord first establishes a church in the heavens, and then through the heavens on the earth. This is the hidden message contained in these words.</p><p>[3] Now for the exposition. "Write" symbolically means to commit something to posterity for its remembrance (nos. <a href="39.htm">39</a>, <a href="63.htm">63</a>, <a href="639.htm">639</a>), in this case to enable it to know these things. This is the meaning of the command to write. "Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb!" means, symbolically, that those people have eternal life who accept the teachings that are the teachings of the New Church. Those people are called blessed who have eternal life (no. <a href="639.htm">639</a>). The marriage of the Lamb symbolizes a new church having a conjunction with the Lord, as in no. <a href="812.htm">812</a> above. The people who are called mean all who accept (no. <a href="744.htm">744</a>). All, indeed, are called, but those who do not accept, reject the call.</p><p>[4] The conjunction is called the Lamb's marriage supper because it takes place when the church is in its final state, which is called its evening, and suppers take place in the evening. The first state of a new church is in contrast called morning. It is in its evening state that a person is called to the church, and when the people called are present, its morning state commences.<p>That the final state of the church is called evening and night, and its first state dawn and morning, may be seen in no. <a href="151.htm">151</a> above.<p>Now because the final period of the Jewish Church, thus its evening, occurred when the Lord went to Jerusalem to suffer, therefore the Lord supped with the disciples then and instituted the Eucharist, which is why it is called Holy Supper. It, too, is a means of the Lord's conjunction with a person of the church, or wedding, if after repentance the person turns to Him directly. Otherwise it occasions His presence and not conjunction.<p>It can be seen from this what a dinner and dining symbolize elsewhere in the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 816</h4><p>816. [verse 9] 'And he said unto me, Write, Blessed are those who are called to the supper of the Lamb's wedding' signifies one angel out of heaven sent to John and speaking with him concerning the Lord's New Church, and saying that on earth it would be given to know that those who receive the things that are of that Church have eternal life. That out of heaven to John there was sent one angel who spoke these words to him can be established from the following verse [where it is said] that John fell down at his feet to adore him, and that the angel answered that he was his fellow-servant; therefore that not he but God should be adored. That the former things that John heard were out of heaven itself and by means of many angels speaking together from the Lord, is quite plain from the preceding verses (<a href="5.htm">5-7</a>) where it is said that 'a voice came out of the throne,' and that there was heard 'the voice of a great crowd, and as it were of many waters, and as it were of powerful thunders,' and of them saying 'Let us rejoice and exult.' These were in the plural, but now it is in the singular, thus from one angel sent to him.</p><p>[2] But I will state how the case is when angels speak with a man. They never speak with him out of heaven, but the voice that is heard thence is from the Lord through heaven. But when it is granted to angels to speak with a man they send out one of their society who may be near the man, and they speak with the man through him. He who is sent is the subject of many; and it was such a one in the present instance who spoke with John. This was done so that it might be known on earth that the entire heaven acknowledges the Only Lord as the God of heaven, and that He Himself Only is to be adored; also that the New Church is going to be set up on earth by the Lord, just as it has been set up in the heavens; for the Church is first set up by the Lord in the heavens, and afterwards by means of the heavens on earth. This is what is hidden in these words.</p><p>[3] Now to the exposition: 'write' signifies so that he might commit this to posterity for a remembrance (<a href="39.htm">39</a>, <a href="63.htm">63</a>, <a href="639.htm">639</a>), here so that he should make those things known. This is understood by 'write.' 'Blessed are those who are called to the supper of the Lord's wedding' signifies that those who receive the things that are of the New Church will have eternal life. They are said to be 'blessed' who have eternal life (<a href="639.htm">639</a>). By 'the Lamb's wedding' is signified the New Church, which is in conjunction with the Lord, as above (<a href="812.htm">812</a>). By 'those called' are understood all who receive (<a href="744.htm">744</a>). All are called, indeed, but those who do not receive reject the call.</p><p>[4] The reason it is termed 'the supper of the Lamb's wedding' is because this takes place in the last state of the Church which is called 'evening,' and suppers take place in the evening; but the first state of the New Church is called 'morning.' A man is called to the Church in the 'evening,' but when those called are present it is the 'morning.' That the last state of the Church is called 'evening' and 'night' and its first state 'day-break' and 'morning' may be seen above (<a href="151.htm">151</a>). And because it was the last time of the Jewish Church, thus the evening, when the Lord went from Jerusalem to suffer, therefore the Lord then had a supper with the disciples and instituted the Eucharist, which is why it is termed 'the Holy Supper.' By this means also a conjunction of the Lord with the man of the Church is effected, or a wedding, if the man after having done the work of repentance approaches Him directly. If otherwise, there is the presence but not a conjunction. From these considerations it can be established what is signified elsewhere in the Word by a 'supper' and 'to sup. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 816</h4><p>816. Verse 9. And He said unto me, Write, Happy are they that are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb, signifies an angel sent from heaven to John, and speaking with him concerning the Lord's New Church, and saying that it was given to know on earth, that those have eternal life who receive the things which are of that church. That it was an angel sent from heaven to John that spoke these things to him, may be evident from the following verse, that John fell down at his feet to adore him; and that the angel answered, that he was his fellow-servant; therefore that not he, but God, was to be adored. That the former things which John heard were from heaven itself, and by many angels speaking together from the Lord, is plainly manifest from the preceding verses 5-7; where it is said that "a voice came out of the throne," and that thus was heard "as it were a voice of a great multitude, and as of many waters, and as of mighty thunders," and of them that said, "Let us rejoice and exult." These were in the plural; but now it is in the singular, and thus by a single angel sent to him.</p><p>[2] But I will relate how it is, when angels speak with man. They never speak with him from heaven; but the voice which is heard thence is from the Lord through heaven. But when it is given to the angels to speak with a man, they send one from their society, who is near the man; and they speak with the man through him. He who is sent is the subject of many, and it was such a subject who now spoke with John. This was done, that it might be announced on earth, that the whole heaven acknowledges the Lord alone as the God of heaven, and that He alone is to be adored; also that the New Church is to be established by the Lord on the earth, as it has been established in the heavens; for a church is first established in the heavens by the Lord, and then through the heavens on the earth. This is the arcanum in these words.</p><p>[3] Now to the explanation. "Write" signifies that he should commit this to posterity for remembrance, (<a href="39.htm">39</a>, <a href="63.htm">63</a>, <a href="639.htm">639</a>); here, that he should make these things known; this is meant by "write.""Happy are they that are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb," signifies that those have eternal life who receive those things which are of the New Church. They are called "happy," who have eternal life, (<a href="639.htm">639</a>). By "the marriage of the Lamb" the New Church is signified, which is in conjunction with the Lord, as above, (<a href="812.htm">812</a>[1-3] "the called" are meant all who receive, (<a href="744.htm">744</a>[1-2]); all are called, indeed; but they who do not receive, reject the call.</p><p>[4] It is called "the marriage supper of the Lamb," because this is done in the last state of the church, which is called evening; and in the evening suppers take place; but the first state of the New Church is called morning. In the evening man is called to the church; and when the called are present, the morning comes. That the last state of the church is called evening and night, and its first state the dawn and morning, may be seen above, (<a href="151.htm">151</a>[1-3]). And because it was the last state of the Jewish church, and thus evening, when the Lord went from Jerusalem to suffer, the Lord therefore then supped with the disciples, and instituted the Eucharist; whence it is called the holy supper; by which also is effected the conjunction of the Lord with the man of the church, or a marriage, if the man, after repentance, goes directly to Him; but if otherwise, presence is effected, and not conjunction. From this it may be evident what is signified by "supper" and "to sup" elsewhere in the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 816 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>816. (Vers. 9.) "Et dicit mihi, Scribe, Beati qui ad Caenam nuptiarum Agni vocati sunt," significat unum Angelum e Caelo missum ad Johannem, et loquentem cum illo de Nova Ecclesia Domini, et dicentem, quod daretur scire in terris quod vita aeterna sit illis qui recipiunt illa quae istius Ecclesiae sunt. - Quod fuerit unus Angelus missus e Caelo ad Johannem, qui haec locutus est ad illum, constare potest a sequente versu, quod Johannes prociderit ad pedes ejus ad adorandum illum, et quod Angelus responderit quod conservus ejus esset, ideo quod non ille sed Deus adorandus esset. Quod priora, quae Johannes audivit, fuerint ex ipso Caelo, et per multos angelos simul loquentes a Domino, patet manifeste a versibus praecedentibus (5-7), ubi dicitur, quod "vox e Throno exiverit," et quod audita sit "vox tanquam turbae multae, et tanquam aquarum multarum, et tanquam tonitruum vehementium," ac dicentium "gaudeamus et exultemus;" haec in plurali, nunc autem in singulari, ita ab uno Angelo misso ad illum. Sed dicam quomodo fit, cum angeli loquuntur cum homine. Nusquam loquuntur cum illo e Caelo; sed vox quae inde auditur, est a Domino per Caelum. At cum datur angelis loqui cum homine, mittunt e societate sua unum, qui prope hominem sit, et per illum loquuntur cum homine. Ille qui mittitur, est subjectum plurium: et hic est qui cum Johanne nunc locutus est. Hoc factum est, ut annuntiaretur in terris quod universum Caelum agnoscat Solum Dominum pro Deo Caeli, et quod Ipse Solus adorandus sit; tum quod Nova Ecclesia in terris a Domino instauranda sit, sicut instaurata est in Caelis; nam Ecclesia primum instauratur in Caelis a Domino, et dein per Caelos in terris: hoc arcanum est in his. Nunc ad explicationem: "Scribe" significat ut mandet hoc posteritati in recordationem (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_816/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_39" target=_top>39</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_816/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_63" target=_top>63</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_816/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_639" target=_top>639</a>), hic ut det scire illa, hoc intelligitur per "scribe:" "beati qui ad Caenam nuptiarum Agni vocati sunt," significat quod vita aeterna sit illis qui recipiunt illa quae Novae Ecclesiae sunt; "beati" dicuntur illi quibus vita aeterna est (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_816/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_639" target=_top>639</a>); per "nuptias Agni" significatur Nova Ecclesia, quae in conjunctione cum Domino est, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_816/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_812" target=_top>812</a>); per "vocatos" intelliguntur omnes qui recipiunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_816/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_744" target=_top>744</a>); sunt quidem omnes vocati, sed qui non recipiunt illi rejiciunt vocationem. Quod dicatur "Caenam nuptiarum Agni," est quia hoc fit in statu ultimo Ecclesiae, qui vocatur vespera, et in vesperis fiunt caenae; status autem primus Ecclesiae Novae vocatur mane; in vespera vocatur homo ad Ecclesiam, et cum vocati adsunt, fit mane. Quod status ultimus Ecclesiae dicatur vespera et nox, et status primus ejus diluculum et mane, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_816/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_151" target=_top>151</a>). Et quia ultimum tempus Ecclesiae Judaicae fuit, ita vespera, quando Dominus abivit Hierosolymam ut pateretur, ideo tunc Dominus caenavit cum discipulis, et instituit Eucharistiam; unde est quod dicatur Sacra Caena: per quam etiam fit conjunctio Domini cum homine Ecclesiae, seu nuptiae, si homo, postquam paenitentiam egerat, Ipsum directe adit; sin aliter, fit praesentia et non conjunctio. Ex his constare potest, quid per "caenam" et "caenare" significatur alibi in Verbo. </p>
