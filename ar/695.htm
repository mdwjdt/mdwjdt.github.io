<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第695节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>695.“兽的国就黑暗了”表只显现出虚假。“黑暗”表示虚假，因为“光明”表示真理；“黑暗”（darkness）表示邪恶所藉的虚假，“幽暗”（thick darkness）表示源于邪恶的虚假（参看<a href="413.htm">413</a>节）。因此，“兽的国就黑暗了”表示只显现出虚假。那些确认与仁分离之信的人歪曲整部圣言（参看<a href="136.htm">136</a>，<a href="610.htm">610</a>节）。他们并未处于任何真理（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="501.htm">501</a>，<a href="653.htm">653</a>节），而是陷入纯粹的虚假（<a href="563.htm">563</a>，<a href="597.htm">597</a>，<a href="602.htm">602</a>节）。不过，其信之虚假在他们自己面前的确不像黑暗，也就是说，不像虚假；相反，经他们确认之后，在他们看来，这些虚假仿佛清澈透明，也就是如同真理；但从揭露一切事物的天堂之光观之，它们就像黑暗。正因如此，当天堂之光流入他们在地狱的洞穴时，这黑暗黑到他们看不见彼此；因此，一切地狱都被关闭，免得留下缝隙；于是，他们便处在自己的光中。之所以在他们自己看来，他们似乎处于光明，而非黑暗，尽管他们陷入虚假，是因为他们的虚假经确认之后，在他们看来如同如同真理，因而带给他们光明；但这是诸如确认虚假之光的愚昧之光。这光对应于猫头鹰和蝙蝠的视觉之光，它们的视觉以黑暗为光明，以光明为黑暗，甚至视为太阳本身为幽暗。那些在世时确认虚假，到了视虚假为真理，视真理为虚假地步的人，死后就会有这种眼睛。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 695</h4><p>695. And his kingdom became full of darkness. This symbolically means that nothing but falsities appeared.<p>Darkness symbolizes falsities because light symbolizes truth. To be shown that darkness symbolizes falsities that lead to evils, and thick darkness falsities springing from evils, see no. <a href="413.htm">413</a> above. Thus the beast's kingdom becoming full of darkness means symbolically that nothing but falsities appeared.<p>People who have confirmed themselves in a faith divorced from charity falsify the whole Word, as may be seen in nos. <a href="136.htm">136</a>, <a href="610.htm">610</a> above. That they possess no truths, nos. <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="501.htm">501</a>, <a href="653.htm">653</a>, but only falsities, nos. <a href="563.htm">563</a>, <a href="597.htm">597</a>, <a href="602.htm">602</a>.<p>Still, the falsities of their faith do not in fact appear to them as full of darkness, that is, as false, but they appear as though full of light, that is, as true, once they have confirmed themselves in them. Nevertheless, when these falsities are viewed in the light of heaven, which reveals everything, they appear as being full of darkness. Consequently, whenever the light of heaven flows into the rooms in their abodes in hell, the rooms become so dark that one cannot see another. Every hell is therefore closed over, so that not even a crack appears, and the inhabitants are then in their own light. They do not appear to themselves to be in darkness, but rather surrounded by light, even though they are caught up in falsities, and that is because their falsities, once they have confirmed themselves in them, appear to them as true. Thus their light is an illusory light, like the light of any falsity defended. This light corresponds to the light seen by owls and bats, which see darkness as light, and light as darkness - indeed, in whose sight the sun is nothing but thick darkness. Such is the sight acquired after death by people who in the world have confirmed themselves in falsities, to the point that they see falsity as true, and truth as false. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 695</h4><p>695. 'And his kingdom was made dark' signifies that nothing but untruths were appearing. By 'darkness' untruths are signified, because truth is signified by 'light.' That 'darkness' signifies the untruths by means of which evils [come], and that 'thick darkness' signifies untruths derived from evils, may be seen above (<a href="413.htm">413</a>). Consequently by 'the kingdom of the beast was made dark' is signified that nothing but untruths were appearing. That those who have confirmed faith separated from charity falsify the whole Word may be seen above (<a href="136.htm">136</a>, <a href="610.htm">610</a>); that they do not have any truths (<a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="501.htm">501</a>, <a href="653.htm">653</a>); but merely untruths (<a href="563.htm">563</a>, <a href="597.htm">597</a>, <a href="602.htm">602</a>). But the untruths of their faith do not indeed appear before themselves as dark, that is, as untrue, but they appear as full of light, that is, as true, after they have confirmed them. Nevertheless, while they are viewed from the light of heaven, which discovers all things, they appear as dark. Therefore while the light of heaven is inflowing into the vaults with those in hell it becomes so dark that they do not see one another. For this reason every hell has been closed so as not to leave a crevice open, and then they are in their own light. Their not appearing to themselves in darkness but in light, although they are in untruths, is because their untruths after they have confirmed them appear as truths to them. Their light results from this, but it is a foolish light such as is the light of the confirmation of what is untrue. This light corresponds to the light of the vision of owls and bats, to which the darkness is light and the light darkness, indeed, to which the sun is merely thick darkness. Such eyes do those get after death who have confirmed themselves in untruth in the world to the extent that they see untruth as true and truth as untrue. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 695</h4><p>695. And His kingdom became dark, signifies that nothing but falsities appeared. By "darkness" falsities are signified, because "light" signifies truth; that "darkness" signifies falsities, by which are evils, and "thick darkness," falsities from evils, see above, (<a href="413.htm">413</a>). Therefore by "the kingdom of the beast became dark" is signified that nothing but falsities appeared. That they who have confirmed faith separated from charity, falsify the whole Word, may be seen above, (<a href="136.htm">136</a>, <a href="610.htm">610</a>[1-2]); that they are not in any truths, (<a href="489.htm">489</a>[1-2], <a href="501.htm">501</a>, <a href="653.htm">653</a>), but in mere falsities, (<a href="563.htm">563</a>, <a href="597.htm">597</a>, <a href="602.htm">602</a>). But the falsities of their faith do not indeed appear before themselves as darkness, that is, as falsities, but they appear to them as if they were lucid, that is, as truths, after they have confirmed them; but nevertheless while they are viewed from the light of heaven, which discloses all things, they appear as darkness. For which reason, when the light of heaven flows into their dens in hell, the darkness is such that they cannot see one another; on which account every hell is closed so as not to leave a crevice open, and then they are in their own light [lumen]. The reason why they do not appear to themselves to be in darkness but in light, although they are in falsities, is because their falsities, after confirmation, appear to them as truths, hence comes their light; but it is the light of infatuation, such as is the light of the confirmation of what is false. This light corresponds to that to which owls and bats owe their sight, to which darkness is light and light darkness, yea, to which the sun itself is thick darkness. Such eyes do they have after death, who in the world confirmed themselves in falsities to such a degree as to see falsity as truth and truth as falsity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 695 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>695. "Et factum est regnum ejus tenebrosum," significat quod non apparerent nisi falsa. - Per "tenebras" significantur falsa, quia per "lucem" significatur verum: quod "tenebrae" significent falsa per quae mala, et quod "caligo" falsa ex malis, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_695/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_413" target=_top>413</a>); <sup>1</sup>inde per "factum est regnum Bestiae tenebrosum," significatur quod non apparerent nisi quam falsa. Quod illi qui Fidem separatam a Charitate confirmaverunt, falsificent totum Verbum, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_695/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_536" target=_top>536</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_695/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_610" target=_top>610</a>); quod illis non sint aliqua vera (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_695/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_489" target=_top>489</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_695/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_501" target=_top>501</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_695/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_653" target=_top>653</a>); <sup>2</sup>sed mere falsa (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_695/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_563" target=_top>563</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_695/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_597" target=_top>597</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_695/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_602" target=_top>602</a>). Sed falsa fidei eorum non quidem apparent coram ipsis ut tenebrosa, hoc est, ut falsa, sed apparent ut lucida, hoc est, ut vera, postquam confirmaverunt illa; at usque dum spectantur e luce Caeli, quae detegit omnia, apparent ut tenebrosa: quare dum lux Caeli in cameras apud illos in Inferno influit, fit ita tenebrosum, ut non videat unus alterum; quare omne infernum clausum est, ut ne quidem pateat rima, et tunc in suo lumine sunt. Quod non sibi appareant in tenebris sed in lumine, tametsi in falsis Sunt, est quia falsa eorum, postquam confirmaverunt illa, apparent illis sicut vera; inde lumen eorum; sed est lumen fatuum, sicut est lumen confirmationis falsi: lumen hoc correspondet lumini visus noctuarum et vespertilionum, quibus tenebrae sunt lumen, et lumen tenebrae; imo quibus sol est mera caligo; tales oculos nanciscuntur illi post mortem, qui se in mundo in falsis confirmaverunt, eo usque ut videant falsum sicut verum, ac verum sicut falsum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;413 pro "513"<p>2.&nbsp;489 pro "467" </p>
