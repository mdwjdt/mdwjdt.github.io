<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第99节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>99.“看哪，魔鬼要把你们中间一些人下在监里”表其生活的良善会受到来自地狱的邪恶侵扰。这就是被魔鬼“下在监里”的含义，因为“魔鬼”是指那些处于邪恶之人所在的地狱，抽象而言，是指在其中并由此而来的邪恶（<a href="97.htm">97</a>节）。“下在监里”是指受到侵扰，因为那些被出于地狱的邪恶侵扰之人犹如囚在监里，他们在意愿良善时，只能思想邪恶。冲突和内心的焦虑由此产生，使其难以自拔，如同被锁链捆绑的人。原因在于，其良善只要与虚假粘在一块，就不是良善，并且只要与虚假粘在一块，邪恶就在其中；因此这就是侵扰之物。</p><p>不过，这种侵扰发生在灵界，而非自然界，在人死后发生。我经常被恩准看到他们被侵扰的情形，听到他们哀告说，他们曾经行善，如今也愿意行善，却由于周围的邪恶而无能为力。然而，他们受侵扰的方式不尽相同，照其确认虚假的程度，有的更为严重，故经上说：“魔鬼要把你们中间一些人下在监里”。确认虚假是有害的，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/91.htm">91</a>-97节）一书。</p><p>圣言中，“被囚的”和此处“下在监里”的所表相同，如以下经文：</p><p>我立你作人民的约，领被囚的出牢狱，领坐黑暗的出牢房。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.6.htm">42:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.7.htm">7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.8.htm">49:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>耶和华差遣我向被囚的宣告自由，向被捆绑的宣告释放。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.1.htm">61:1</a>）</p><p>我因与你立约的血，将被掳而囚的人从坑中释放出来。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.11.htm">9:11</a>）</p><p>神领被囚的出来。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.6.htm">68:6</a>）</p><p>愿被囚之人的叹息达到你面前。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗79.11.htm">79:11</a>）</p><p>要垂听被囚之人的叹息，要为死亡之子开门。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗102.20.htm">102:20</a>）</p><p>耶和华释放被囚的。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗146.7.htm">146:7</a>）</p><p>很明显，在上述经文中，“被囚的”不是指世上被囚的人，而是指被地狱，因而邪恶与虚假所囚的人。主的这些话也是同样的含义：</p><p>我在监里，你们不来看顾我。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.43.htm">25:43</a>）</p><p>由于主将那些尽管在教义上处于虚假，但在生活上仍处于良善的人“领出监牢”，或从侵扰中解救出来，所以祂说：“你将要受的苦你不用怕”，还说：“你务要至死忠心，我就赐给你那生命的冠冕”。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 99</h4><p>99. "'Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison.'" This symbolically means that their goodness of life will be infested by evils emanating from hell.<p>Being thrown into prison by the devil has this symbolic meaning because the devil means a hell that is inhabited by people caught up in evils, and so abstractly the evil that exists there and that emanates from there (no. <a href="97.htm">97</a>).<p>To be thrown into prison is to be infested, because people who are infested by evils from hell are as though bound in prison, for they cannot help but meditate evil, even if they will good. This gives rise to an inner combat and distress from which they cannot be set free, almost like people in chains. That is because their good is not good as long as it is bound up with falsities; and to the extent that it is bound up with falsities, evil is present in it. This good is accordingly what is infested.</p><p>[2] This infestation, however, occurs not in the natural world, but in the spiritual world, thus after death. I have often been granted to see the infestations of people there. They lament, saying that they have done good, and wish to continue doing good, and yet are unable to now because of the evils surrounding them.<p>Not all, however, are infested alike. They are infested more or less severely in the measure that they have confirmed themselves in falsities. We are accordingly told that the devil will throw "some of you" into prison. Confirmation of falsity is harmful, as may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="../ss/91.htm">91-97</a>.</p><p>[3] "The bound" in the Word have the same symbolic meaning as those thrown into prison here, as in the following passages:<p>...I will give You as a covenant to the people..., to bring out the bound from the prison, (and) those who sit in darkness from the house of confinement. (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6-7</a>, cf. <a href="3927/isaiah_49_8.htm">49:8-9</a>)<p>(Jehovah) has sent Me... to proclaim liberty to the captives, and... to those who are bound. (<a href="3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>)<p>By the blood of your covenant I will set free your bound ones from the pit. (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_11.htm">Zechariah 9:11</a>)<p>God... has brought out those who are bound with fetters. (<a href="3927/psalms_68_6.htm">Psalms 68:6</a>)<p>The groaning of the bound will come before You. (<a href="3927/psalms_79_11.htm">Psalms 79:11</a>)<p>To hear the groaning of the bound, to let loose those consigned to death. (<a href="3927/psalms_102_20.htm">Psalms 102:20</a>)<p>Jehovah (who) sets the bound free. (<a href="3927/psalms_146_7.htm">Psalms 146:7</a>)<p>It is apparent that the bound in these places do not mean people in bonds in the world, but people bound by hell, thus by evils and falsities.<p>The following words of the Lord have the same symbolic meaning:<p>I was... in prison and you did not visit Me. (<a href="3927/matthew_25_43.htm">Matthew 25:43</a>)<p>Since the Lord brings out of prison or liberates from infestation people who as to life were engaged in good, even if as to doctrine they were caught up in falsities, therefore He says, "Do not fear any of those things which you are about to suffer," and, "Be faithful..., and I will give you the crown of life." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 99</h4><p>99. 'Behold, the devil is going to cast some of you into custody' signifies that their good of life will be infested by evils that are from hell. This is signified by being cast into custody or prison by the devil, because by 'the devil' is understood the hell where are those who are in evils, and thus abstractly the evil that is therein and therefrom (<a href="97.htm">97</a>). To be sent 'into custody' or prison is to be infested, because those who are infested by evils out of hell are as if bound in prison, for they are able to think only evil, when yet they will good. A combat and interior anxiety arises therefrom, and they are unable to be released from this, being almost exactly like those who are in bonds. This is because their good, so far as it coheres with untruths, is not good; and so far as it coheres with untruths, it has evil in it.</p><p>[2] This, therefore, is what is infested. The infestation takes place, not in the natural world but in the spiritual world, thus after death. To see their infestations has been frequently granted me. They lament, saying that they have done good and wish to do good, and yet now they are unable on account of the surrounding evils. However, they are not all infested in the same manner; but more severely as they have confirmed themselves in untruths, and it is therefore said, 'the devil will cast some of you into custody.' That the confirmation of untruth is harmful may be seen its <a href="../ss/91.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture 91-97</a>).</p><p>[3] In the Word the same thing is signified by 'the bound' as here by those 'cast into custody,' as in these passages:<p>I will give thee for a covenant of the people to bring out the bound from custody, and those who sit in darkness out of the prison house. <a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6-7</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_49_8.htm">49:8-9</a>.<p>Jehovah has sent me to preach liberty to the captives, and to the bound. <a href="3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>.<p>By the blood of thy covenant I will send forth the bound out of the pit, <a href="3927/zechariah_9_11.htm">Zechariah 9:11</a>.<p>God leads forth those bound with fetters. <a href="3927/psalms_73_6.htm">Psalms 73:6</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_73_7.htm">7</a>].<p>Let the groaning of the bound come before Thee. <a href="3927/psalms_79_11.htm">Psalms 79:11</a>.<p>To hear the groaning of the bound, to open to the sons of death. <a href="3927/psalms_102_20.htm">Psalms 102:20</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_102_21.htm">21</a>].<p>Jehovah Who looses the bound. <a href="3927/psalms_146_7.htm">Psalms 146:7</a>.<p>It is plain that in these passages by 'the bound' are not understood those bound in the world, but those bound by hell, thus by evils and untruths. The like is signified by these words of the Lord:<p>I was in custody, and you came not unto Me. <a href="3927/matthew_25_43.htm">Matthew 25:43</a>.<p>Since the Lord brings out of custody, or delivers from infestation those who as to life have been in good though as to doctrine in untruths, He says, 'Fear none of the things that thou art going to suffer'; also, 'Be thou faithful, and I will give thee a crown of life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 99</h4><p>99. Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, signifies that their good of life will be infested by evils which are from hell. That this is signified by "being cast into custody" or into "prison" by the devil, is, because by "the devil" is meant the hell where they are who are in evils, and thus, abstractly, the evil which is there and from thence, (<a href="97.htm">97</a>). To be cast "into custody" or "prison," is to be infested, because they who are infested by evils from hell are as if they were bound in prison, for they cannot think anything but evil, when yet they will good; hence there is combat and interior anxiety, from which they cannot be released, being scarcely otherwise than like persons who are in chains; the reason is, that their good is not good so far as it coheres with falsities, and so far as it coheres with falsities evil is in it; therefore this is what is infested.</p><p>[2] But this infestation does not exist in the natural world, but in the spiritual world, thus after death. It has often been granted me to see their infestations. They lament, saying that they have done good, and wish to do good, and yet now they cannot, because of the evils which surround them. But still they are not all infested alike, but more severely according as they have confirmed themselves in falsities, therefore it is said "the devil shall cast some of you into prison." That the confirmation of what is false is hurtful, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, (<a href="91.htm">91-97</a>).</p><p>[3] In the Word, by "the bound" the like is signified as here by those "cast into prison," as in these places:<p>I will give thee for a covenant of the people, to bring out the bound from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house, (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6-7</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_49_8.htm">49:8-9</a>).<p>Jehovah hath sent me to preach liberty to the captives, and to the bound, (<a href="3927/isaiah_61_1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>).<p>By the blood of Thy covenant I will send forth the bound out of the pit, (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_11.htm">Zechariah 9:11</a>).<p>God bringeth out those which are bound with fetters, (<a href="3927/psalms_68_6.htm">Psalms 68:6</a>).<p>Let the groaning of the bound come before thee, (<a href="3927/psalms_79_11.htm">Psalms 79:11</a>).<p>To hear the groaning of the bound, to open to the sons of death, (<a href="3927/psalms_102_20.htm">Psalms 102:20</a>).<p>Jehovah who looseth the bound, (<a href="3927/psalms_146_7.htm">Psalms 146:7</a>).<p>It is plain that by "the bound" in these places are not meant those who are bound in the world, but those who are bound by hell, thus by evils and falsities. Similar is the signification of these words of the Lord:<p>I was in prison, and ye came not unto Me, (<a href="3927/matthew_25_43.htm">Matthew 25:43</a>).<p>As the Lord "brings out of prison," or delivers from infestation, those who have been in good as to life, though in falsities as to doctrine, He says: "Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer;" also, "Be thou faithful, and I will give thee a crown of life." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 99 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>99. "Ecce futurum, ut conjiciat ex vobis diabolus in custodiam," significat quod bonum vitae eorum a malis quae ab inferno, infestabitur. - Quod hoc significetur per "conjici in custodiam" seu "carcerem" a diabolo, est quia per "diabolum" intelligitur infernum ubi illi qui in malis sunt, et sic abstracte malum quod ibi et inde est (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_99/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_97" target=_top>97</a>). Quod "in custodiam" seu "carcerem" mitti, sit infestari, est quia illi qui a malis ex inferno infestantur, sunt sicut vincti in carcere, non enim possunt quam malum cogitare, cum tamen bonum volunt; inde pugna et anxietas interior, ex qua non possint exsolvi, vix aliter quam sicut qui in vinculis sunt; causa est, quia bonum eorum non est bonum quantum cohaeret falsis, et quantum cohaeret falsis ei inest malum; hoc itaque est quod infestatur. Ast infestatio illa non existit in Mundo naturali, sed in Mundo spirituali, ita post mortem: infestationes illorum datum est mihi saepius videre; lamentantur, dicentes quod bonum fecerint, ac bonum facere velint, et tamen nunc a malis circum non possunt. Sed usque non omnes similiter infestantur, durius sicut se confirmaverunt in falsis; quare dicitur, "diabolus conjiciet ex vobis in custodiam;" quod confirmatio falsi damnosa sit, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_99/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_91" target=_top>Doctrina Nova Hierosolyma de Scriptura Sacra 91-97</a>. In Verbo per "vinctos" simile significatur, quod hic per "conjectos in custodiam," ut in his locis: <p>"Dabo Te in foedus populi ad educendum e custodia Vinctum, et e domo claustri sedentes in tenebris," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_99/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_42_6-7" target=_top>Esaias 42:6-7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_99/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_49_8-9" target=_top>49:8-9</a>);<p>"Jehovah misit Me ad praedicandum captivis libertatem, et Vinctis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_99/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_61_1" target=_top>Esaias 61:1</a>);<p>"Per sanguinem foederis Tui, emittam Vinctos e fovea," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_99/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_9_11" target=_top>Sacharias 9:11</a>);<p>"Deus eduxit Vinctos compedibus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_99/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_68_7" target=_top>Psalm 68:7</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_99/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_68_6" target=_top>6</a>));<p>"Veniet ante Te gemitus Vincti," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_99/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_79_11" target=_top>Psalm 79:11</a>);<p>"Ad audiendum gemitum Vincti, ad aperiendum filiis mortis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_99/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_102_21" target=_top>Psalm 102:21</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_99/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_102_20" target=_top>20</a>));<p>"Jehovah Qui solvit Vinctos," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_99/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_146_7" target=_top>Psalm 146:7</a>);<p>quod per "Vinctos" in his locis non intelligantur vincti in mundo, sed vincti ab inferno, ita a malis et falsis, patet. Simile significatur per haec Domini verba: <p>"In Custodia fui, et non venistis ad Me," (Matthaeus 43 [NCBSP: <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_99/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_25_43" target=_top>Matthaeus 25:43</a>]). <sup>1</sup><p>Quoniam Dominus illos "educit ex custodia," seu liberat ab infestatione, qui in bono quoad vitam fuerunt, tametsi in falsis quoad doctrinam, dicit, "Nihil timeas quae futurus es pati," tum "Esto fidelis, et dabo tibi coronam vitae."<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;43 pro "36" </p>
