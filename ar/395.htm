<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第395节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>395.启8:5.“天使拿着香炉，盛满了坛上的火，倒在地上”表含有属天之爱的属灵之爱，以及它流入低层区域，就是那些陷入与仁分离之信的人所在之地。“香炉”和“香”都表示出于属灵之爱的敬拜，这一点从前面所述和以下事实明显可知：在圣言中，盛东西的和所盛之物所表相同，如杯、盘与所盛的酒与食物所表相同（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.25.htm">23:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.26.htm">26</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.20.htm">22:20</a>等）。</p><p>“燔祭坛上的火”之所以表示神性属天之爱，因为这种祭坛表示出于属天之爱的敬拜（<a href="392.htm">392</a>节）；“火”在至高意义上表示神性之爱（<a href="494.htm">494</a>节）。属灵之爱，也就是仁爱从属天之爱，也就是对主之爱得其本质；若离了属天之爱，也就是对主之爱，属灵之爱，或仁爱里面毫无具有生气之物，因为灵与生命唯独来自主，而非来自其它源头。在以色列教会，这一点由他们上香时只从燔祭坛为香炉取火来代表。这一点明显可见于摩西五经（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.12.htm">16:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.13.htm">13</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民16.46.htm">16:46</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民16.47.htm">47</a>）；还有:</p><p>亚伦的两个儿子因取凡火烧香（即不从祭坛取火）而被天上的火烧灭。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.1.htm">10:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>因此，经上规定：</p><p>在燔祭坛上必有常常烧着的火，不可熄灭。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.13.htm">6:13</a>）</p><p>这是因为燔祭坛上的火表示主的神性之爱，因而表示对主之爱。将“香炉倒在地上”表示流入低层区域。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 395</h4><p>395. Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it to the earth. (<a href="3927/revelation_8_5.htm">8:5</a>) This symbolizes spiritual love, containing celestial love, and its influx into the lower regions where those people were who were caught up in a faith divorced from charity.<p>A censer, just like incense, symbolizes worship springing from a spiritual love. This is apparent from what we have already shown, and from the fact that in the Word, a container has the same symbolism as what it contains, even as a cup and plate have the same symbolism as wine and food (<a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>, <a href="3927/luke_22_20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>, and elsewhere).<p>Fire from the altar of burnt offering symbolizes Divinely given celestial love, because that altar symbolized worship springing from that love (see no. <a href="392.htm">392</a> above). And fire in the highest sense symbolizes Divine love (no. <a href="494.htm">494</a>).<p>Spiritual love, or charity, takes its essence from celestial love, or love toward the Lord. Apart from that love, spiritual love or charity has in it no vitality, for spirit and life have no other origin than the Lord.<p>This was represented in the Israelite Church by their taking fire for their censers and burning incense only from the altar of burnt offering, as can be seen in the books of Moses (<a href="3927/leviticus_16_12.htm">Leviticus 16:12-13</a>).<p>It was also a statute, therefore, that fire burn continually on the altar of burnt offering and not go out (<a href="3927/leviticus_6_13.htm">Leviticus 6:13</a>). The reason was that the fire of that altar symbolized the Lord's Divine love, and thus love toward the Lord.<p>Throwing the censer to the earth symbolizes an influx into lower regions. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 395</h4><p>395. [verse 5] 'And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the land' signifies spiritual love in which there is celestial love, and its influx into the lower regions where were those who are in a faith separated from charity. That by a 'censer' as well as by 'incense' is signified worship out of spiritual love is plain from the things shown above, and from the fact that in the Word a thing containing signifies the same as what is contained, even after the manner of cup and platter signifying the same as wine and food (<a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>, and elsewhere). By 'the fire of the altar' of burnt-offering is signified celestial Divine Love, because worship out of that love used to be signified by that altar, [as] may be seen above (<a href="392.htm">392</a>); and by 'fire' in the highest sense is signified Divine Love (<a href="494.htm">494</a> <sup>1</sup>). Spiritual love, which is charity, draws its essence out of celestial love, which is love directed to the Lord. Without this love there is no vitality in spiritual love or charity, for spirit and life is from no other source than the Lord. This was represented in the Israelitish Church by the fact that they should not take fire in the censers and offer incense from anywhere else but the altar of burnt-offering, as can be established in Moses (<a href="3927/leviticus_16_12.htm">Leviticus 16:12-13</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_16_46.htm">Numbers 16:46-47</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/numbers_17_11.htm">17:11-12</a>]); and that:<p>The two sons of Aaron were consumed by fire out of heaven, because they were offering incense from strange fire (that is, from fire not taken from the altar). <a href="3927/leviticus_10_1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>.<p>Therefore also it was stated that:<p>The fire should burn continually upon the altar of burnt-offering, and should not be put out. <a href="3927/leviticus_6_13.htm">Leviticus 6:13</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/leviticus_6_6.htm">6</a>].<p>This was because the fire of that altar used to signify the Lord's Divine Love, and consequently love directed to the Lord. By 'casting the censer upon the land' is signified the influx into lower regions.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;It is possible that <a href="468.htm">468</a> was intended here. <a href="599.htm">599</a>e refers to both <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="494.htm">494</a>, and of these two <a href="468.htm">468</a> seems appropriate. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 395</h4><p>395. Verse 5. And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it unto the earth, signifies spiritual love, in which is celestial love, and its influx into the lower parts, where they were who are in faith separated from charity. That by "a censer," as well as by "incense," is signified worship from spiritual love, is evident from what was shown above; and also from this, that in the Word, the thing containing signifies the same as the thing contained, as a cup and platter signify the same as wine and food, (<a href="3927/matthew_23_25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_20.htm">Luke 22:20</a> and in other places). By "the fire of the altar of burnt-offering," is signified the Divine celestial love, because by that altar was signified worship from that love, as may be seen above, (<a href="392.htm">392</a>); and by "fire," in the highest sense, is signified the Divine love, (<a href="494.htm">494</a>). Spiritual love, which is charity, derives its essence from celestial love, which is love to the Lord; without this love there is nothing vital in spiritual love or charity, for spirit and life is from no other source than from the Lord. This was represented in the Israelitish church by their taking fire for the censers when they offered incense, only from the altar of burnt-offering; as may appear in Moses, (<a href="3927/leviticus_16_12.htm">Leviticus 16:12-13</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_16_46.htm">Numbers 16:46-47</a>); and that:<p>The two sons of Aaron were consumed by fire from heaven, because they offered incense from strange fire (that is, from fire not taken from the altar) (<a href="3927/leviticus_10_1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>).<p>Therefore it was also ordained, that:<p>Fire should burn continually on the altar of burnt-offering, and should not be put out, (<a href="3927/leviticus_6_13.htm">Leviticus 6:13</a>).<p>This was because the fire of that altar signified the Divine love of the Lord, and thence love to the Lord. By "casting the censer upon the earth" is signified influx into lower things. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 395 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>395. (Vers. 5.) "Et accepit Angelus thuribulum et implevit illud (de) igne Altaris, et projecit in terram," significat amorem spiritualem, in quo amor caelestis, et ejus influxum <sup>1</sup>in inferiora, ubi illi qui in fide separata a charitate erant. - Quod per "thuribulum," aeque ac per "suffitum," significetur cultus ex amore spirituali, patet a supra ostensis; et ex eo, quod in Verbo continens significet idem cum contento, quemadmodum etiam poculum et patina idem cum vino et cibo, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_395/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_23_25-26" target=_top>Matthaeus 23:25-26</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_395/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_22_20" target=_top>Luca 22:20</a>; et alibi). Quod per "ignem Altaris holocausti" significetur Divinus Amor caelestis, est quia per illud Altare significabatur cultus ex illo amore, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_395/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_392" target=_top>392</a>); et per "ignem" in supremo Sensu significatur Divinus amor (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_395/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_494" target=_top>494</a>).<p>Amor spiritualis, qui est charitas, trahit suam essentiam ex amore caelesti, qui est amor in Dominum; absque hoc amore non est vitale in amore spirituali seu charitate, non enim aliunde est spiritus et vita quam a Domino. Hoc repraesentatum est in Ecclesia Israelitica per quod Non aliunde acciperent ignem in thuribula et suffirent, quam ex Altari holocausti (ut constare potest apud Mosen, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_395/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_16_12-13" target=_top>Leviticus 16:12-13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_395/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_17_11-12" target=_top>Numeri 17:11-12</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_395/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_16_46-47" target=_top>16:46-47</a>));<p>et quod Duo Filii Aharonis consumpti fuerint ex igne e Caelo, quia suffiebant ex igne alieno (hoc est, ex igne non desumpto ex Altari) (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_395/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_10_1-2" target=_top>Leviticus 10:1-2</a>);<p>quare etiam statutum fuit, quod Ignis jugiter arderet super Altari holocausti, nec exstingueretur, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_395/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_6_1-30" target=_top>Leviticus 6</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_395/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_6_13" target=_top>13</a>));<p>hoc ex causa, quia ignis illius Altaris significabat Divinum Amorem Domini, et inde amorem in Dominum. Per "projicere thuribulum in terram" significatur influxus in inferiora.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;influxum pro "influxus" (Vide Contenta singulorum versuum.)" </p>
