<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第120节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>120.“我必将那隐藏的吗哪赐给他吃”表智慧，同时行为中属天之爱的良善的归给，因而主与那些作工之人的结合。那些具有善行，同时将教义真理与行为相联结的人所享有的“隐藏的吗哪”是指诸如第三层天的天使所享有的那种隐藏的智慧。因为这些天使在世时既具有善行，同时也具有教义的真理，故在智慧上远远胜过其他天使，享有隐藏的智慧，因为这智慧铭刻在他们的生命中，而非完全存于记忆。因此，他们具有这样的性质，他们不谈论教义真理，而是行出来。他们之所以行出来，是因为别人一谈起真理，他们就会明白，而且还看到它们。爱之良善就归给他们，主与那些将教义真理与善行相联结的人结合，并以此在其良善中赋予他们智慧，这就是“将那隐藏的吗哪赐给他吃”。这一点可通过主的这些话得以证实：</p><p>神的粮，就是那从天上降下来赐生命给世界的。我就是生命的粮；你们的祖宗在旷野吃过吗哪，还是死了。这是从天上降下来的粮，叫人吃了就不死。我是从天上降下来生命的粮；人若吃这粮，就必永远活着。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.31.htm">6:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.51.htm">51</a>）</p><p>由此可见，若他们唯独靠近主，主自己就是那将在他们行为中的“隐藏的吗哪”。或说“主”，或说“属天之爱的良善”，或说“属天之爱的智慧”，意思都一样。不过，这是一个奥秘，只要心灵被俗事的云层遮蔽，这奥秘就很难进入任何人的属世观念。但当心灵平静下来，处在阳光之中，它就会进入。这一点可见于《圣爱与圣智》全文。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 120</h4><p>120. "'I will give to eat of the hidden manna.'" This symbolizes wisdom and an assimilation of the good of celestial love then, and thus a conjunction of the Lord with those who perform works.<p>The hidden manna that people will have who are engaged in good works and at the same time add doctrinal truths to the works, means a private wisdom, such as people have who are in the third heaven. For as these were focused on good works and doctrinal truths simultaneously in the world, they enjoy a wisdom beyond that of other angels, but a private wisdom, for it is engraved on their life and not so much on their memory. Therefore people of this character are such that they do not talk about doctrinal truths but practice them, and they practice them because they know them and also see them when others talk about them.<p>The goodness of love is imparted to people who add doctrinal truths to their good works, and the Lord conjoins Himself with them and thus grants them wisdom in their good works; and that this is what it is to give to eat of the hidden manna can be seen from these words of the Lord:<p>...the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world... I am the bread of life... Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that anyone who eats of it does not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. (<a href="3927/john_6_31.htm">John 6:31-58</a>)<p>It is apparent from this that the Lord Himself is the hidden manna that will be in their works if they turn to Him alone.<p>Whether you say the Lord or the good of celestial love and the wisdom of that love, the meaning is the same. But this is an arcanum that falls with difficulty into anyone's natural comprehension, as long as it is clouded over with worldly notions. However, it does fall within the comprehension when it comes into a state of serenity and sunshine, as can be seen from beginning to end in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 120</h4><p>120. 'I will give to eat of the hidden manna' signifies wisdom, and the appropriation then of the good of celestial love in works, and in this manner the conjunction of the Lord with those who are doing works. By the hidden manna 'that they will have, who are in good works and at the same time adjoin truths of doctrine to the works, is understood a hidden wisdom such as those have who are in the third heaven. For these, because in the world they have been in good works and in truths of doctrine at the same time, are in a wisdom exceeding that of the rest of the angels. They are, however, in a hidden wisdom, for it has been inscribed on their life and not so much on their memory, and therefore they are such as do not speak about truths but do them, and do them because they know them, and may also see them when others speak them. That the good of love is appropriated to them, and that the Lord conjoins Himself with those who adjoin truths of doctrine to good works, and in that way gives them wisdom in their goods, and that this is 'to give to eat of the hidden manna can be established from these words of the Lord:<p>The bread of God is He Who comes down from heaven, and gives life unto the world. I am the bread of life: your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead. This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that he who eats thereof may not die. I am the living bread, Who came down out of heaven; if any one eat of this bread, he shall live forever. <a href="3927/john_6_31.htm">John 6:31-58</a>.<p>From these things it is plain that the Lord Himself is 'the hidden manna' that will be in their works if they approach Him only. Whether you say 'the Lord,' or 'the good of celestial love,' or even the wisdom of that love,' it is the same. But this is an arcanum that scarcely fits in with the natural idea of anyone so long as that is veiled over by a cloud from worldly things, but it does fit in when he has [a mind] unclouded and exposed to the sunshine, as can be seen concerning these things in ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM, from beginning to end. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 120</h4><p>120. I will give to eat of the hidden manna, signifies wisdom, and at the same time the appropriation of the good of celestial love in works, and thus conjunction of the Lord with those who work. By "the hidden manna," which they will have who are in good works, and who at the same time adjoin the truths of doctrine to works, is meant hidden wisdom of a quality like that which they have who are in the third heaven. For these, because they were in good works, and at the same time in truths of doctrine in the world, are in wisdom above other angels, but in hidden wisdom, for it is written in their life and not so much on their memory; therefore they are of such a nature that they do not talk of the truths of doctrine, but do them, and they do them because they know them, and also see them when others speak them. That the good of love is appropriated to them, and the Lord conjoins Himself with those who adjoin truths of doctrine to good works, and thus gives them wisdom in their good, and that this is "giving to eat of the hidden manna," may appear from these words of the Lord:<p>The bread of God is He which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. I am the bread of life; your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that he who eateth thereof may not die. I am the living bread, that came down from heaven; if anyone eat of this bread he shall live forever, (<a href="3927/john_6_31.htm">John 6:31-51</a>).<p>From which it is evident, that the Lord Himself is "the hidden manna" which will be in their works, if they approach Him alone. Whether you say "the Lord" or "the good of celestial love," and "the wisdom of that love," it is the same. But this is an arcanum which enters with difficulty into the natural idea of anyone, so long as it is veiled over with a cloud from worldly things; but it does enter when the mind is serene and in the sunshine, as may be seen in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom from beginning to end. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 120 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>120. "Dabo illi edere de manne abscondito," significat sapientiam et tunc appropriationem boni amoris caelestis in operibus, et sic conjunctionem Domini cum illis qui operantur. - Per "man absconditum," quod illis erit qui in bonis operibus sunt et simul operibus adjungunt vera doctrinae, intelligitur sapientia recondita, qualis est illis qui in tertio Caelo sunt; hi enim, quia in bonis operibus et simul in veris doctrinae in Mundo fuerunt, in sapientia sunt prae reliquis Angelis, sed in sapientia abscondita, est enim inscripta vitae illorum, et non ita memoriae; quare tales sunt, ut non loquantur de veris doctrinae sed faciant illa, et faciunt quia sciunt,et quoque videant illa quando alii loquuntur illa. Quod approprietur illis bonum amoris, et Dominus conjungat Se cum illis, qui adjungunt bonis operibus vera doctrinae, et sic det illis sapientiam in bonis illorum, et quod hoc sit dare "edere de manne abscondito," constare potest ex his Domini verbis: <p>"Panis Dei est Qui e Caelo descendit, et dat vitam mundo: Ego sum Panis vitae: patres vestri ederunt Man in deserto, et mortui sunt. Hic est Panis ille Qui e Caelo descendit, ut qui edit de eo non moriatur: Ego sum Panis vivens, qui e Caelo descendi; si quis ederit ex hoc Pane, vivet in aeternum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_120/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_6_31-51" target=_top>Johannes 6:31-51</a>). <sup>1</sup><p>Ex quibus patet, quod Ipse Dominus sit "Man absconditum," quod in operibus eorum erit, si Ipsum solum adeunt: sive dicas "Dominum," sive "Bonum amoris caelestis," tum "Sapientiam illius amoris," idem est. Sed hoc est arcanum quod aegre cadit in ideam naturalem alicujus, quamdiu illa obvelata est nube a mundanis, sed cadit cum ei serenum et apricum est, ut de his videri potest in Sapientia Angelica de Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia, a principio ad finem.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;31-51 pro "31 ad 38" </p>
