<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第740节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>740.启17:12.“你所看见的那十角，就是十王。他们还没有得国”表圣言出于神性真理的能力在那些居于法国，没有如此受教皇辖制的人当中；然而他们中间尚未形成一个完全脱离天主教的教会。这些话指着那些居于法国的人说的，这一点从灵义上的这一系列事明显可知；因为现在论述的是那些在基督教界之人对圣言的接受；9-11节论述了天主教对圣言的接受和相应的教会状态；12-14节论述了那些仅外在依附天主教的人（他们主要居于法国）对圣言的接受和相应的教会状态。15节论述了剩下的人，就是的确信奉天主宗教，但在各种事上持异议的人；16和17节论述了新教或改革宗，他们公开退出天主教。</p><p>若不知道“朱红色的兽”表示圣言，并且教会取决于对圣言的接受，就决无可能知道此处论述的是这些事。“朱红色的兽”表示圣言（参看<a href="723.htm">723</a>节）；教会通过圣言并照着对圣言的理解而成为教会，对此，可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/76.htm">76</a>-79节）。“角”，就是此处这兽的角，表示圣言的能力；“十角”表示大有能力，在此表示神性能力，因为这是主通过圣言来的能力。“角”表示能力，“十角”表示大有能力（参看<a href="270.htm">270</a>，<a href="539.htm">539</a>和<a href="724.htm">724</a>节）。“王”表示那些处于源自圣言的神性真理之人，抽象来说，表示圣言的神性真理（<a href="20.htm">20</a>，<a href="664.htm">664</a>，<a href="704.htm">704</a>节）；“十”不是指十，而是指众多人或众多事物（<a href="101.htm">101</a>节）。“（王）国”表示出自圣言的教会，因为“王”表示那些处于源自圣言的神性真理之人，抽象来说，表示圣言的神性真理。因此，“他们还没有得国”表示他们中间尚未形成一个教会，因而脱离天主教。</p><p>由此可见，“你所看见的那十角，就是十王。他们还没有得国”表示圣言出于神性真理的能力在那些居于法国，以及其它一些地方的人当中，也在那些被称为詹森派”（又译冉森派）的人当中，他们没有如此受教皇辖制；然而他们中间尚未形成一个教会，因而完全脱离天主教。之所以说在法国的人当中的教会尚未脱离天主教，是因为这个教会只是外在依附于天主教，而内在并未如此依附。外在只是形式，而内在才是本质。他们仍依附于天主教，这是因为法国有众多修道院，并且教牧职份受制于教皇的权威；这些人在一切形式上接受教皇法令法规的管理，因而仍大量处于天主教的本质。因此，那里的教会尚未脱离天主教。这就是“他们（十王）还没有得国”所表示的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 740</h4><p>740. <a href="3927/revelation_17_12.htm">17:12</a> "The ten horns which you saw are ten kings that have not yet received a kingdom." This symbolizes the Word as to the power it has from Divine truths among Roman Catholics who live in France and are not so much under the yoke of papal dominion, who nevertheless have not yet formed among them therefore a church separate from the Roman Catholic religion.<p>That this is said in reference to Roman Catholics in France can be seen from the series of things in the spiritual sense. For the subject now is the reception of the Word by people in the Christian world. Reception of the Word and the consequent state of the church among Roman Catholics is the subject of verses <a href="3927/revelation_17_9.htm">9-11</a>. Reception of the Word and the consequent state of the Church among people committed to that religion only in respect to its outward forms, who are found primarily in France, is the subject of verses <a href="3927/revelation_17_12.htm">12-14</a>. All other people who profess that religion indeed, yet dissent from it in various ways, are the subject of verse <a href="3927/revelation_17_15.htm">15</a>. And Protestants or the Reformed, who have completely turned away from that religion, are the subject of verses <a href="3927/revelation_17_16.htm">16</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_17_17.htm">17</a>.</p><p>[2] One cannot possibly know, however, that these are the subjects of these verses unless he knows that the scarlet beast means the Word, and that the church is a church in accordance with its reception of the Word. That the scarlet beast means the Word may be seen in no. <a href="723.htm">723</a> above. And that the church is a church because of the Word and in accordance with its understanding of it, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="76.htm">76</a>-<a href="79.htm">79</a>.<p>Horns, here the horns of the beast, symbolize the power of the Word, and ten horns much power, in this case Divine power, because the power is the Lord's by means of the Word.<p>That horns symbolize power, and ten horns much power, may be seen in nos. <a href="270.htm">270</a>, <a href="539.htm">539</a>, <a href="724.htm">724</a> above. That kings symbolize people governed by Divine truths from the Word, and in an abstract sense the Divine truths themselves there, may be seen in nos. <a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="664.htm">664</a>, <a href="704.htm">704</a>, and that ten means, not ten, but many people or things, in no. <a href="101.htm">101</a>. A kingdom symbolizes a church founded on the Word, because kings symbolize people who are governed by Divine truths from the Word, and abstractly, the Divine truths themselves there. Consequently the ten kings' not yet having received a kingdom symbolizes people who have not yet formed among them a church separate therefore from the Roman Catholic religion.</p><p>[3] It can be seen from this that "the ten horns are ten kings that have not yet received a kingdom" symbolizes the Word as to the power it has from Divine truths among Roman Catholics who live in France and in some other places, including those called Jansenists, <sup>1</sup>and who are not so much under the yoke of papal dominion, who nevertheless have not yet formed among them a church separate therefore from the Roman Catholic religion.<p>We say that the church among Roman Catholics in France is not yet separate from the Roman Catholic religion because it adheres to that religion in outward aspects, but not so much in internal realities.<p>Outward aspects are formal ones, and internal realities the essential ones. Roman Catholics in France still adhere to the Roman Catholic religion because of the many monasteries in France, and because priestly offices there are under the jurisdiction of the Pope. Moreover, in every outward form their priests conduct themselves in accordance with papal edicts and regulations, and many of the people are as a consequence still caught up in the essential tenets of that religion. Because of that the church there has not yet separated itself.<p>That is what is symbolically meant by the ten kings' not yet having received a kingdom.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Adherents of the theological propositions of Cornelius Otto Jansen (1585-1638), which held that people cannot of themselves keep God's commandments, that they lack free will, and that their salvation or condemnation is predestined. These propositions were condemned by the Roman Catholic Church as heretical. French Jansenists suffered persecution through most of the 18th century, and many took refuge in the Netherlands. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 740</h4><p>740. [verse 12] 'And the ten horns <sup>1</sup>are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom' signifies the Word as to the power derived from Divine Truths with those who are in the kingdom of France and are not in that manner under the yoke of the Papal dominion, among whom, however, there has not yet been formed a Church thus separated from the Roman Catholic form of religion. That these things have been said of those in the kingdom of France can be established out of the series of things in the spiritual sense; for it now treats of the reception of the Word by those who are in Christendom: of the reception of the Word and the state of the Church therefrom with the Roman Catholics (verses 9-11); of the reception of the Word and the state of the Church therefrom with those who have been attached to that religion only as to external things, who are chiefly in the kingdom of France (verses 12-14); of the rest who indeed profess that form of religion, but still dissent in various things (verse 15); also of the Protestants or Reformed who have openly withdrawn from that form of religion (verses 16-17).</p><p>[2] It can, however, by no means be known that all these (his et illis) are treated of, unless it is known that by 'the scarlet beast' is understood the Word, and that the Church is in accordance with the reception of the Word. That by 'the scarlet beast' is understood the Word may be seen above (<a href="723.htm">723</a>); and that the Church is a Church out of the Word and in accordance with the understanding thereof, in <a href="../ss/76.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 76-79</a>. By 'horns,' here the horns of the beast, is signified the power of the Word, and by 'the ten horns' much power, here Divine power because it is the Lord's power by means of the Word. That 'horns' signify power, and 'ten horns' much power, may be seen above (<a href="270.htm">270</a>, <a href="539.htm">539</a>, <a href="724.htm">724</a>) that by 'kings' are signified those who are in Divine truths out of the Word, and abstractly the Divine Truths there (<a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="664.htm">664</a>, <a href="704.htm">704</a>), and that by 'ten' are signified not ten but many, people or things (<a href="101.htm">101</a>). By 'a kingdom 'is signified a Church out of the Word because by 'kings' are signified those who are in Divine Truths out of the Word, and abstractly the Divine Truths there. Consequently by 'they have not yet received a kingdom' is signified with whom there has not yet been formed a Church thus separated from the Roman Catholic form of religion.</p><p>[3] From these considerations it can be seen that by 'the ten horns are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom' is signified the Word as to power out of Divine Truths with those who are in the kingdom of France and in some other places, who also are called Jansenists, and are not so much under the yoke of the Papal dominion. With these, however, there has not yet been formed a Church thus separated from the Roman Catholic form of religion. The Church with those who are in the kingdom of France is said to be not yet separated from the Roman Catholic form of religion because it coheres with that in external but not in internal things, the external things being the formal and the internal the essential. The reason they still cohere there is because there are so many monasteries there, and because the priests there are under the rule of the Pontiff, and in all formal things they follow (sunt secundum) the Papal edicts and statutes, and consequently are still very much in the essentials of the same form of religion. The Church there has therefore not yet been separated. This is what is signified by 'they have not yet received a kingdom.'<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Original Edition omits 'that thou hast seen' here and at <a href="717.htm">717</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 740</h4><p>740. Verse 12. And the ten horns <sup>1</sup>are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, signifies the Word as to power from the Divine truths with those who are in the kingdom of France, and are not so much under the yoke of the Papal dominion, with whom however there has not yet been formed a church thus separated from the Roman Catholic religious persuasion. That these things are said of those who are in the kingdom of France may be evident from the series of things in the spiritual sense; for it now treats of the reception of the Word by those who are in the Christian world: the reception of the Word, and the state of the church thence, with the Roman Catholics (verses <a href="3927/revelation_17_9.htm">9-11</a>); the reception of the Word, and the state of the church thence, with those who are attached to that religious persuasion only as to externals, who are especially in the kingdom of France (verses <a href="3927/revelation_17_12.htm">12-14</a>). The rest, who indeed profess that religion, but still dissent in various things, are treated of in Verse 15, and the Protestants, or Reformed, who have openly receded from that religion (verses <a href="3927/revelation_17_16.htm">16-17</a>).</p><p>[2] But it can by no means be known that all these are here treated of, unless it is known that the Word is meant by "the scarlet beast," and that the church is according to the reception of the Word. That by the "scarlet beast" is meant the Word, may be seen above, (<a href="723.htm">723</a>); and that the church is a church from the Word and according to its understanding, see <a href="../ss/76.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture 76-79</a>. By "horns," here the horns of the beast, the power of the Word is signified; and by "ten horns" much power, here Divine power, because it is that of the Lord through the Word. That "horns" signify power, and "ten horns" much power, may be seen above, (<a href="270.htm">270</a>, <a href="539.htm">539</a>, <a href="724.htm">724</a>). That by "kings" are signified those who are in Divine truths from the Word, and abstractly the Divine truths therein, (<a href="90.htm">90</a>, <a href="664.htm">664</a>, <a href="704.htm">704</a>); and that by "ten" is not meant ten but many and many things, (<a href="101.htm">101</a>[1-3]). By "a kingdom" is signified the church from the Word, because by "kings" are signified those who are in Divine truths from the Word, and abstractly the Divine truths therein. Hence by "they had not yet received a kingdom" is signified with whom there is not yet formed a church, thus separated from the Roman Catholic religious persuasion.</p><p>[3] It may be seen from this, that by "the ten horns are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom," is signified the Word as to power from Divine truths with those who are in the kingdom of France, and in some other places; also those who are called Jansenists, and are not much under the yoke of the Papal dominion; with whom, however, there is not yet formed a church thus separated from the Roman Catholic religious persuasion. The church with those in the kingdom of France is said not yet to be separated from the Roman Catholic religious persuasion, because it coheres with it in externals, but not so much in internals. The externals are formalities and the internals are essentials. That they still adhere to it, is because there are so many monasteries there, and because the priesthood there is under the authority of the Pontiff; and these in all formalities are governed according to the Papal edicts and statutes; and hence are still very much in the essentials of that religious persuasion. On which account the church there is not yet separated. This is what is signified by "they have not yet received a kingdom."<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original Latin omits "which thou sawest." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 740 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>740. (Vers. 12.) "Et decem Cornua (,quae vidisti,) decem Reges sunt, qui regnum nondum acceperunt," significat Verbum quoad potentiam ex Divinis veris apud illos qui in regno Galliae sunt, et non ita sub jugo Dominii Papalis sunt, apud quos tamen nondum Ecclesia ita separata a Religioso Catholico Romano facta est. -Quod haec de illis in Galliae regno dicta sint, constare potest ex serie rerum in Sensu spirituali; agitur enim nunc de receptione Verbi ab illis qui in Christiano orbe sunt; de receptione Verbi et inde statu Ecclesiae apud Romano Catholicos (vers. 9-11); de receptione Verbi et inde statu Ecclesiae apud illos qui Religioso isti nisi solum quoad externa addicti sunt, qui sunt in regno Galliae imprimis (12-14); de reliquis qui quidem Religiosum illud profitentur sed usque in variis dissentiunt (vers. 15) et de Protestantibus seu Reformatis, qui a Religioso illo plane recesserunt (vers. 16, 17). Sed quod de his et illis hic agatur, prorsus non sciri potest nisi sciatur quod per "Bestiam coccineam" intelligatur Verbum, et quod Ecclesia sit secundum receptionem Verbi. Quod per "Bestiam coccineam" intelligatur Verbum, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_740/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723" target=_top>723</a>); et quod Ecclesia sit Ecclesia ex Verbo et secundum intellectum ejus, in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_740/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_76" target=_top>76-79</a>). Per "cornua," hic "cornua Bestiae," significatur potentia Verbi; et per "decem cornua" multa potentia, hic Divina potentia, quia est Domini per Verbum. Quod "cornua" significent potentiam, et "decem cornua" multam potentiam, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_740/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_270" target=_top>270</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_740/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_539" target=_top>539</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_740/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_724" target=_top>724</a>) quod per "reges" significentur illi qui in Divinis veris ex Verbo sunt, et abstracte Divina Vera ibi (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_740/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_20" target=_top>20</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_740/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_664" target=_top>664</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_740/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_704" target=_top>704</a>), et quod per "decem" non intelligantur decem, sed multi ac multa (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_740/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_101" target=_top>101</a>). Per "regnum" significatur Ecclesia ex Verbo, quia per "reges" significantur qui in Divinis Veris ex Verbo sunt, et abstracte Divina Vera ibi; inde per "regnum nondum acceperunt" significatur apud quos nondum Ecclesia ita separata a Religioso Catholico Romano facta est. Ex his videri potest, quod per "decem cornua decem Reges sunt, qui regnum nondum acceperunt,"significetur Verbum, quoad potentiam ex Divinis Veris, apud illos qui in Regno Galliae sunt, et alicubi alibi, etiam qui Jansenistae vocantur, et non ita sub jugo Dominii papalis sunt; apud quos tamen nondum Ecclesia ita separata a Religioso Catholico Romano facta est. Dicitur Ecclesia apud illos in Regno Galliae nondum separata a Religioso Catholico Romano, quia cohaeret cum illo in externis, sed non ita in internis. Externa sunt formalia ac interna sunt essentialia. Quod adhuc ibi cohaereant, est quia tot ibi monasteria sunt, et quia sacerdotia ibi sub jure Pontificis sunt, et hi in omni formali sunt secundum edicta et <sup>1</sup>statuta papalia: et inde permulti adhuc in essentialibus Religiosi istius sunt; quare Ecclesia ibi separata nondum est. Hoc est quod significatur per quod "regnum nondum acceperint."<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;et pro "est" </p>
