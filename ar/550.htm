<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第550节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>550.启12:9.“大龙被摔下来，就是那古蛇，名叫魔鬼和撒旦”表“龙”所表示的那些人从主转向他们自己，从天堂转向世界，进而因肉体而变得感官化，他们必然陷入其欲望的邪恶，由此陷入虚假，并因与主并天堂分离而变成魔鬼和撒旦。至于“龙”表示谁，可参看前文（<a href="537.htm">537</a>节）；这些人由于将神一分为三，将主一分为二，将十诫列入毫无救恩的行为当中，故被称为“古蛇、魔鬼和撒旦”；“蛇”表示因肉体而感官化的人（<a href="424.htm">424</a>节），这种人从主转向他自己，从天堂转向世界；“魔鬼”表示那些陷入欲望的邪恶之人，而“撒旦”表示那些由此陷入虚假的人（<a href="97.htm">97</a>，<a href="153.htm">153</a>末尾，<a href="856.htm">856</a>，<a href="857.htm">857</a>节）。这也是引诱夏娃与亚当的那条蛇，这一点从对他的描述和他所受的咒诅（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.1.htm">3:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.15.htm">15</a>）明显可知。“龙”在此被称为“魔鬼和撒旦”，他之所以被如此称呼，是因为所有在地狱者都是魔鬼和撒旦；因此，地狱整体上被如此称呼。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 550</h4><p>550. So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan. (<a href="3927/revelation_12_9.htm">12:9</a>) This symbolizes those people meant by the dragon now turned away from the Lord to themselves and from heaven to the world, and so whose focus on their person made them sensual, who could not help but be caught up in the evils of their lusts and the resulting falsities, and who, in consequence of their separation from the Lord and heaven, became devils and satanic spirits.<p>Just who are meant by the dragon may be seen in no. <a href="537.htm">537</a>. They are people who make God three entities and the Lord two, and put the Ten Commandments among works that do not lead to any salvation, and who are therefore called "that serpent of old," "the Devil and Satan." A serpent symbolizes someone whose carnal nature has made him sensual (no. <a href="424.htm">424</a>), who has turned away from the Lord to himself and from heaven to the world. The Devil symbolizes people caught up in the evils attending lusts, and Satan people caught up for that reason in falsities (nos. <a href="97.htm">97</a>, <a href="153.htm">153</a> fin., 856, 857 <sup>1</sup>).<p>Of such a character also was the serpent that seduced Eve and Adam, as is apparent from its description and the curse on it (<a href="3927/genesis_3_1.htm">Genesis 3:1-5</a>, <a href="3927/genesis_3_14.htm">14-15</a>).<p>The dragon here is called the Devil and Satan as though the two were one individual, but it is called these because people in hell are all devils or satanic spirits, and consequently hell in its entirety is so labeled.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;No. 857 is missing. Nevertheless we find three references to it, in nos. <a href="550.htm">550</a>, <a href="858.htm">858</a>, <a href="870.htm">870</a>, and because both nos. <a href="550.htm">550</a> and <a href="858.htm">858</a> include as well a reference to no. 856, and no. 858 in the text comes immediately after <a href="856.htm">856</a>, it seems quite likely that no. 857 was omitted accidentally by the printer of the first edition. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 550</h4><p>550. [verse 9] 'And the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old called the Devil and Satan' signifies those who are understood by 'the dragon,' turned away from the Lord to themselves and from heaven to the world, and consequently as a result of bodily activity become sensual, who cannot but be in the evils of their own lusts and the consequent untruths, and by separation from the Lord and heaven become devils and satans. Who are understood by 'the dragon' may be seen (<a href="537.htm">537</a>). These, because they make God three and the Lord two, and because they register the precepts of the Decalogue among the works by means of which there is no salvation, are called the 'serpent of old, the Devil and Satan'; and by a 'serpent' is signified a man sensual as a result of bodily activity (<a href="424.htm">424</a>) who has turned away from the Lord to himself and from heaven to the world; and by 'the Devil' those are signified who are in the evils of lusts, and by 'Satan' those who consequently are in untruths (<a href="97.htm">97</a>, <a href="153.htm">153</a>, <a href="856.htm">856-857</a>). <sup>1</sup>Such also was the 'serpent' that led Eve and Adam astray, as is plain from the description of him and his being cursed (<a href="3927/genesis_3_1.htm">Genesis 3:1-5</a>, <a href="3927/genesis_3_14.htm">14-15</a>). Here the 'dragon' is termed 'Devil and Satans' as one, but it is so said because all in hell are devils and satans, and in consequence hell as a whole is so called.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;There is no 857 in the Original Edition, but references to it are found in <a href="550.htm">550</a>, <a href="858.htm">858</a>, <a href="870.htm">870</a>. In view of the statement at the end of <a href="856.htm">856</a> it is possible that a paragraph treating in greater detail of the signification of both 'the Devil' and 'Satan' was omitted by the printer. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 550</h4><p>550. Verse 9. And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, signifies that they who are meant by "the dragon" turned from the Lord to themselves, and from heaven to the world, and thence became sensual from the corporeal, who could not but be in the evils of their lusts and thence in falsities, and by separation from the Lord and heaven became devils and satans. Who are meant by "the dragon," may be seen, (<a href="537.htm">537</a>); these, inasmuch as they make God three, and the Lord two, and because they place the commandments of the Decalogue among works by which there is not any salvation, are called "the old serpent, the Devil, and Satan;" and by "a serpent" is signified a man sensual from the corporeal, (<a href="424.htm">424</a>), who turns from the Lord to himself, and from heaven to the world; and by "the Devil" are signified they who are in the evils of lusts; and by "Satan," they who are thence in falsities, (<a href="97.htm">97</a>, <a href="153.htm">153</a>, <a href="856.htm">856</a>, <a href="857.htm">857</a>). Such, also, was the serpent which seduced Eve and Adam, as appears from his description and the curse pronounced upon him, (<a href="3927/genesis_3_1.htm">Genesis 3:1-5</a>, <a href="3927/genesis_3_14.htm">14-15</a>). "The dragon" is here called "the Devil and Satan," but he is so called, because all in hell are devils and satans; and thence hell in the aggregate is so called. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 550 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>550. (Vers. 9.) "Et projectus est Draco ille magnus, ille Serpens antiquus vocatus Diabolus et Satanas," significat illos qui per "Draconem" intelliguntur, aversos a Domino ad semet et a Caelo ad mundum, et inde ex corpori sensuales factos, qui non possunt aliter quam in malis concupiscentiarum suarum esse et inde falsis, et per separationem a Domino et Caelo fieri diabolos et satanas. - Quinam per "Draconem" intelliguntur, videatur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_550/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_37" target=_top>37</a>); qui quia Deum faciunt tres, ac Dominum duos, et quia praecepta Decalogi referunt inter opera per quae non aliqua salvatio, vocantur "Serpens antiquus, Diabolus et Satanas;" et per "Serpentem" significatur homo ex corporeo sensualis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_550/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_424" target=_top>424</a>), qui a Domino aversus est ad semet et a Caelo ad mundum; ac per "Diabolum" significantur qui in malis concupiscentiarum sunt; ac per "Satanam" qui inde in falsis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_550/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_97" target=_top>97</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_550/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_153" target=_top>153</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_550/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_856" target=_top>856</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_550/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_857" target=_top>857</a>). Talis etiam fuit Serpens qui seduxit Evam et Adamum, ut patet a descriptione et maledictione ejus, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_550/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_3_5" target=_top>Genesis 3:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_550/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_3_14-15" target=_top>14-15</a>). Dicitur hic "Draco, Diabolus et Satanas" sicut unus, sed ita dicitur, quia omnes in inferno sunt diaboli et satanae, et inde Infernum in complexu vocatur ita. </p>
