<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第493节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>493.启11:4.“这二人就是那两棵橄榄树，两个灯台，立在大地之神面前的”表爱与聪明，或仁与信，这二者皆通过主而与他们同在。“橄榄树”表示爱与仁，如下文所述；“灯台”表示真理中的启示（<a href="43.htm">43</a>节），因而表示聪明和信，因为聪明来自真理中的启示，信也由此而来。“立在神面前”表示听从并执行祂的吩咐（<a href="366.htm">366</a>节）；故在此表示这二者通过主，也就是大地之神而与他们同在，也就是与上述那些处于新教会的两大基本要素之人同在；由此明显可知，两个见证人“就是那两棵橄榄树，两个灯台”表示它们是爱与聪明，或仁与信，因为这二者构成教会；爱与仁是其生命，聪明和信是其教义。</p><p>“橄榄树”之所以表示爱与仁，是因为橄榄树表示属天的教会，因而其果实“橄榄”就表示属天之爱，这爱就是对主之爱；正因如此，这爱（对主之爱）还以“橄榄油”来表示，教会的一切圣物都以此油膏抹。被称为“圣油”的橄榄油是从橄榄提炼并调和香料制成的（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.23.htm">30:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.24.htm">24</a>）。还有，会幕中灯台上的灯每晚用橄榄油点着（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.20.htm">27:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.21.htm">21</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利24.2.htm">24:2</a>）。在以下经文中，“橄榄树”和“橄榄”具有同样的含义：</p><p>灯台旁边有两棵橄榄树，一棵在油盆的右边，一棵在左边；两颗橄榄树的果子：这些就是两个橄榄树上的人站在全地之主面前。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚4.3.htm">4:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚4.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚4.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚4.14.htm">14</a>）</p><p>诗篇：</p><p>我就像神殿中的青橄榄树。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗52.8.htm">52:8</a>）</p><p>耶利米书：</p><p>从前耶和华给你起名叫青橄榄树，又华美又结好果子。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶11.16.htm">11:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶11.17.htm">17</a>等）</p><p>由于“耶路撒冷”表示教会，所以在城内及周围的许多事物也表示诸如属教会的那类事物。橄榄山也在耶路撒冷旁边，表示神性之爱，因此：</p><p>耶稣白天在殿里教导人，夜里就出去，在橄榄山上过夜。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.37.htm">21:37</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.39.htm">22:39</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.1.htm">8:1</a>）</p><p>并且耶稣就在橄榄山上与祂的门徒谈论世代的末了，以及那时祂的到来（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.3.htm">24:3</a>等；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.3.htm">13:3</a>等）；以及祂从橄榄山往耶路撒冷受难（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.1.htm">21:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.30.htm">26:30</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可11.1.htm">11:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.26.htm">14:26</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.29.htm">19:29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.37.htm">37</a>）。这一切与撒加利亚的预言相符：</p><p>到那日，祂的脚必站在耶路撒冷前面朝东的橄榄山上。（撒加利亚书14:4）</p><p>由于“橄榄树”表示属天教会，故耶路撒冷圣殿中间的基路伯由橄榄树的木头做成，内殿的门，以及门框也是（列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.23.htm">6:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.33.htm">33</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 493</h4><p>493. These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth. (<a href="3927/revelation_11_4.htm">11:4</a>) This symbolizes love and intelligence, or charity and faith, both of which people have in them from the Lord.<p>An olive tree symbolizes love and charity, as explained below. And a lampstand symbolizes enlightenment in truths (no. <a href="43.htm">43</a>), thus intelligence and faith, inasmuch as intelligence comes from an enlightenment in truths, and faith in turn from this. To stand before God means, symbolically, to hear and do what He has commanded (no. <a href="366.htm">366</a>). Here, therefore, it means that these two characteristics in them come from the Lord who is God of the earth, that is, in people who possess the two essential elements of the New Church, as described above. It is apparent from this that the statement that the two witnesses were the two olive trees and two lampstands means, symbolically, that they were love and intelligence, or charity and faith. For these two form the church - love and charity forming its life, and intelligence and faith its doctrine.</p><p>[2] An olive tree symbolizes love and charity because the olive tree symbolizes the celestial church, and thus an olive, being its fruit, symbolizes celestial love, which is love toward the Lord. Because of this, that love is symbolized also by olive oil, with which all the holy accouterments of the church were anointed. The oil called holy oil <sup>1</sup>was extracted from olives and mixed with spices (<a href="3927/exodus_30_23.htm">Exodus 30:23-24</a>). Olive oil was also used to light the lamps of the lampstand in the Tabernacle every evening (<a href="3927/exodus_27_20.htm">Exodus 27:20</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_24_2.htm">Leviticus 24:2</a>).<p>The olive tree and olives have similar symbolic meanings in Zechariah:<p>Two olive trees were by (the lampstand), one at the right of the bowl, the other at its left..., (and) two olive berries... These are the two offspring of the olive tree, which stand before the Lord of the whole earth. (<a href="3927/zechariah_4_3.htm">Zechariah 4:3</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_4_11.htm">11-12</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_4_14.htm">14</a>)<p>In the book of Psalms:<p>I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. (<a href="3927/psalms_52_8.htm">Psalms 52:8</a>)<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>Jehovah called your name, Green Olive Tree, lovely, of beautiful fruit. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_11_16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16-17</a>)<p>And so on elsewhere.</p><p>[3] Since Jerusalem symbolized the church, therefore many things in it and about it also symbolized such things as are connected with the church. Near it, too, was the Mount of Olives, and it symbolized Divine love, which is why Jesus "was during the days in the temple teaching, and at night He went out and spent the night on the Mount of Olives?" (<a href="3927/luke_21_37.htm">Luke 21:37</a>, cf. <a href="3927/luke_22_39.htm">22:39</a>, <a href="3927/john_8_1.htm">John 8:1</a>). It is also why Jesus spoke with His disciples on that mountain regarding the end of the age and His coming then (<a href="3927/matthew_24_3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>ff., <a href="3927/mark_13_3.htm">Mark 13:3</a>ff.). It was also from that mountain that He went to Jerusalem and suffered the cross (<a href="3927/matthew_21_1.htm">Matthew 21:1</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_26_30.htm">26:30</a>, <a href="3927/mark_11_1.htm">Mark 11:1</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_26.htm">14:26</a>, <a href="3927/luke_19_29.htm">Luke 19:29</a>, <a href="3927/luke_19_37.htm">37</a>). Moreover, this accorded with the prediction in Zechariah:<p>In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which faces Jerusalem on the east. (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>)<p>Because the olive tree symbolized the celestial component of the church, therefore the cherubim inside the Temple at Jerusalem were made of olive wood, and so, too, were the doors to the inner sanctuary, and the doorposts (<a href="3927/1-kings_6_23.htm">1 Kings 6:23-33</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="3927/exodus_30_25.htm">Exodus 30:25</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_30_31.htm">31</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_37_29.htm">37:29</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 493</h4><p>493. [verse 4] 'These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands, which are standing before the God of the land' signifies the love and intelligence, or charity and faith, both from the Lord with them. By 'an olive tree' is signified love and charity, concerning which [something] follows; and by 'a lampstand' is signified enlightenment in truths (<a href="43.htm">43</a>) and the intelligence and faith therefrom, because intelligence is derived from an enlightenment in truths and faith is derived from that intelligence. By 'to stand before God' is signified to hear and do the things that He commands (<a href="366.htm">366</a>), here, therefore, that these two are with them from the Lord, Who is 'the God of the land,' that is, with those who are in the two Essentials of the New Church, of which above. From this it is plain that by the two witnesses being 'the two olive trees and the two lampstands' is signified that they were love and intelligence, or charity and faith; for these two make the Church, love and charity the life, and intelligence and faith the doctrine thereof.</p><p>[2] An 'olive tree' signifies love and charity because the 'olive' signifies the celestial Church, and consequently the 'olive tree,' of which it is the fruit, signifies celestial love, which is love directed to the Lord. As a consequence, this love is also signified by the 'oil' with which all the holy things of the Church used to be anointed. The oil, which was called 'oil of holiness,' was:<p>Of olives and spices mixed together, <a href="3927/exodus_30_23.htm">Exodus 30:23-24</a>; and also:<p>The lamps of the lampstand in the tabernacle were made to burn up every evening with (ex) olive oil, <a href="3927/exodus_27_20.htm">Exodus 27:20</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_24_2.htm">Leviticus 24:2</a>.<p>Similar things are signified by 'olive' and 'olive tree' in Zechariah:<p>Two olive trees were near the lampstand, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof; and two berries of olive trees: these air the two sons of the olive tree standing before the Lord of the whole land, <a href="3927/zechariah_4_3.htm">Zechariah 4:3</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_4_11.htm">11-12</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_4_14.htm">14</a>.<p>In David:<p>I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. <a href="3927/psalms_52_8.htm">Psalms 52:8</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_52_10.htm">10</a>].<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>Jehovah called thy name a green olive tree beautiful with fruit. <a href="3927/jeremiah_11_16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16-17</a>; besides elsewhere.</p><p>[3] Since the Church used to be signified by Jerusalem, therefore by many things that were in and around it such things as are of the Church were signified. Near it also was the Mount of Olives, and Divine Love was signified by that, and therefore:<p>Jesus was in the daytime teaching in the temple, and nightly going out He passed the night on the Mount of Olives. <a href="3927/luke_21_37.htm">Luke 21:37</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_39.htm">22:39</a>; <a href="3927/john_8_1.htm">John 8:1</a>.<p>And Jesus upon that mount spoke with the disciples concerning the consummation of the age, and His coming at that time. <a href="3927/matthew_24_3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a> seq.; <a href="3927/mark_13_3.htm">Mark 13:3</a> seq.<p>And also from that mount He went to Jerusalem, and suffered. <a href="3927/matthew_21_1.htm">Matthew 21:1</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_26_30.htm">26:30</a>; <a href="3927/mark_11_1.htm">Mark 11:1</a>; <a href="3927/mark_14_26.htm">14:26</a>; <a href="3927/luke_19_29.htm">Luke 19:29</a>, <a href="3927/luke_19_37.htm">37</a>.<p>And this according to the prediction of Zechariah:<p>His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before the faces of Jerusalem from the east, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>.<p>Because the 'olive tree' used to signify the celestial Church, therefore:<p>The cherubs in the midst of the Jerusalem temple were made Out of olive wood; in like manner the doors to the sanctuary, and the posts, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_23.htm">1 Kings 6:23-33</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 493</h4><p>493. Verse 4. These are the two olive trees, and the two lampstands which are standing before the God of the earth, signifies love and intelligence, or charity and faith, both from the Lord with them. By "an olive tree" is signified love and charity, of which presently; and by "lamp stands" is signified enlightenment in truths, (<a href="43.htm">43</a>), and thence intelligence and faith, because intelligence is from enlightenment in truths, and faith is from this.
