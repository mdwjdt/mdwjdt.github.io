<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第525节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>525.“你的忿怒也临到了，审判死人的时候也到了”表他们的毁灭，以及对那些没有任何属灵生命之人所施行的最后审判。“你的忿怒”表示最后的审判（<a href="340.htm">340</a>节），因而表示他们的毁灭；主的“忿怒”之所以表示这一点，是因为他们觉得好像是主出于忿怒而将其扔进地狱，而事实上，是恶人将自己扔进地狱。这就像是罪犯将他的惩罚归咎于法律，或人将手插到火里，却归咎于燃烧的火，又或撞向一把别人握在手中用来自卫的利剑，被刺穿了，却归咎于这把剑。这就是发生在凡反对主，出于愤怒冲撞那些主所保护之人者身上的情形。从普遍意义上说，受审判的“死人”是指那些死亡离世之人；但从严格意义上说，是指那些没有任何属灵生命的人；“审判”就是针对这些人（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.18.htm">3:18</a> ；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.24.htm">5:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.29.htm">29</a>）。原因在于，那些拥有属灵生命的人被称为“活人”。属灵的生命只在那些靠近主，同时避恶如罪的人身上。</p><p>以下经文所说的人就是指那些没有属灵生命的人：</p><p>他们又与巴力毗珥连合，且吃了祭死人的物。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗106.28.htm">106:28</a>）</p><p>原本仇敌逼迫我的灵魂，使我坐在幽暗之处，如世上的死人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗143.3.htm">143:3</a>）</p><p>要垂听被囚之人的叹息，要释放将要死的人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗102.20.htm">102:20</a>）</p><p>我知道你的行为，按名你是活的，其实是死的。你要警醒！坚固那剩下将近死去的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.1.htm">3:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>“死人”之所以表示这些人，是因为所指的是属灵的死亡；所以，“被杀的”表示那些因属灵的死亡而毁灭的人（<a href="321.htm">321</a>，<a href="325.htm">325</a>节，以及其它地方）。但以下经文中的死人则是指那些死亡离世之人：</p><p>死了的人都凭着这些书卷所记载的受审判。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.12.htm">20:12</a>）</p><p>其余的死人没有复活。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.5.htm">20:5</a>）</p><p>这是因为，“第一次死”表示属世的死亡，也就是离世；“第二次死”表示属灵的死亡，也就是罚入地狱。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 525</h4><p>525. "And Your wrath has come, and the time to judge the dead." This symbolizes the destruction of and the last judgment on those people who were without any spiritual life.<p>Your wrath symbolizes a last judgment (no. <a href="340.htm">340</a>), thus their destruction. This is the symbolic meaning of the Lord's wrath because it appears to people as though the Lord casts people into hell out of anger, when in fact an evil person casts himself into hell. Indeed, the case is similar to that of an evildoer who blames his punishment on the law, or on the fire that burns him if he sticks his hand into it, or on the sword held out in the hand of someone protecting himself if he is pierced through when he rushes upon the blade. Such is the case with everyone who sets himself against the Lord and out of anger rushes upon those whom the Lord protects.<p>The dead who were to be judged mean, in a universal sense, people who have died and departed from the world, but in a strict sense, they mean people who are without any spiritual life. It is the latter who are spoken of in terms of judgment (<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>; <a href="3927/john_5_24.htm">5:24</a>, <a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">29</a>). That is because people who possess spiritual life are called the living. Spiritual life is present only in people who turn to the Lord and at the same time refrain from evils as sins.</p><p>[2] People who are without any spiritual life are those meant in the following passages:<p>They joined themselves to Baal of Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. (<a href="3927/psalms_106_28.htm">Psalms 106:28</a>)<p>...the enemy persecutes my soul...; he has made me dwell in darkness, like the world's dead. (<a href="3927/psalms_143_3.htm">Psalms 143:3</a>)<p>To hear the groaning of the prisoner, (and) to release those appointed to die... (<a href="3927/psalms_102_20.htm">Psalms 102:20</a>)<p>I know your works, that you have a name that you are alive, when you are dead. Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die... (<a href="3927/revelation_3_1.htm">Revelation 3:1-2</a>)<p>These are the people meant by the dead because their death means spiritual death. Consequently, the slain also mean people who have died that same death (nos. <a href="321.htm">321</a>, <a href="325.htm">325</a>, and elsewhere).<p>Those who have died and departed from the world are meant by the dead in the following places:<p>The dead were judged according to... the things which were written in the books. (<a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>)<p>The rest of the dead did not live again... (<a href="3927/revelation_20_5.htm">Revelation 20:5</a>)<p>That is because the first death there means the natural death that is a passing on from the world, while the second death means spiritual death, which is damnation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 525</h4><p>525. 'And Thy wrath is come, and the time of judging the dead' signifies their ruin, and the last judgment upon those not having any spiritual life. By 'Thy wrath' is signified the last judgment (<a href="340.htm">340</a>), thus their ruin. This is signified by the Lord's 'wrath' because it appears to them as if the Lord by reason of wrath casts them down into hell, when yet an evil man casts himself. For it is like a wicked man's attributing to the law his being punished, or to the fire his being burnt if he puts his hand in it, or to a drawn sword in the hand of one defending himself if he is thrust through when he has rushed against its point. So it happens with any one who is against the Lord and in wrath rushes against those whom the Lord is protecting. By 'the dead' who are to be 'judged,' in the universal sense are understood the dead [passed] out of the world, but in the proper sense those are understood who do not have any spiritual life, the judgment of these being foretold (<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>; <a href="3927/john_5_24.htm">5:24</a>, <a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">29</a>). This is because they are said to be 'living' who have spiritual life. Spiritual life is solely with those who approach the Lord and at the same time flee from evils as sins.</p><p>[2] Those who do not have any spiritual life are understood in these places:<p>They joined themselves unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. <a href="3927/psalms_106_28.htm">Psalms 106:28</a>.<p>An enemy is pursuing my soul, he has caused me to sit in darkness as the dead of the world. <a href="3927/psalms_143_3.htm">Psalms 143:3</a>.<p>To hear the groaning of the bound, and to open to the sons of death. <a href="3927/psalms_102_20.htm">Psalms 102:20</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_102_21.htm">21</a>].<p>I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, but thou art dead: be watchful and strengthen the things remaining that are dying. <a href="3927/revelation_3_1.htm">Revelation 3:1-2</a>.<p>Those are understood by 'the dead' because spiritual death is understood, and therefore by 'the slain' are signified those who have suffered extinction by that death (<a href="321.htm">321</a>, <a href="325.htm">325</a>, and elsewhere). But the dead [passed] out of the world are understood by 'the dead' in these:<p>The dead were judged according to the things that were written in the book. <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>.<p>The rest of the dead did not live again. <a href="3927/revelation_20_5.htm">Revelation 20:5</a>.<p>This is because by the first 'death' there is understood the natural death that is [a passing] out of the world, and by the second 'death' the spiritual death that is damnation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 525</h4><p>525. And Thy anger is come, and the time of judging the dead, signifies their destruction, and the Last Judgment upon those who have not any spiritual life. By "Thy anger" is signified the Last Judgment, (<a href="340.htm">340</a>), thus their destruction; the reason why this is signified by "the Lord's anger," is, because it seems to them as if the Lord cast them down into hell from anger, when nevertheless it is the wicked who cast themselves down. For it is like a malefactor who attributes his punishment to the law, or to the fire that burns, if he thrusts his hand in it, or like ascribing to a drawn sword in the hand of one defending himself, if he is thrust through, when he has run against its point. Thus it happens with everyone who is against the Lord, and, out of anger, rushes against those whom the Lord protects. By "the dead" who are to be judged, in the universal sense, are meant they who have died out of the world, but, in a proper sense, are meant they who have not any spiritual life; judgment being predicated of these, (<a href="3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>; <a href="3927/john_5_24.htm">5:24</a>, <a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">29</a>). The reason is, because they are called "the living" who have spiritual life. Spiritual life is with those only who approach the Lord, and at the same time shun evils as sins.</p><p>[2] They who have no spiritual life are meant in these passages:<p>They joined themselves to Baalpeor and ate the sacrifices of the dead, (<a href="3927/psalms_106_28.htm">Psalms 106:28</a>).<p>The enemy persecuteth my soul, he hath caused me to sit in darkness as the dead of the world, (<a href="3927/psalms_143_3.htm">Psalms 143:3</a>).<p>To hear the groaning of the bound, and to open to the sons of death, (<a href="3927/psalms_102_20.htm">Psalms 102:20</a>).<p>I know thy works, that thou hast a name, that thou livest, but art dead; be watchful and strengthen the remaining things which are ready to die, (<a href="3927/revelation_3_1.htm">Rev 3:1-2</a>).<p>The reason these are meant by "the dead," is because spiritual death is meant; therefore also by "the slain" they are signified who are destroyed by that death, (<a href="321.htm">321</a>, <a href="325.htm">325</a>), and in other places. But they who have died out of the world are meant by the dead in these passages:<p>And the dead were judged from those things which were written in the books, (<a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Rev 20:12</a>).<p>The rest of the dead lived not again (<a href="3927/revelation_20_5.htm">Revelation 20:5</a>).<p>The reason is, because, by "the first death" there is meant natural death, which is from the world; and by "the second death" is meant spiritual death, which is damnation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 525 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>525. "Et venit ira Tua, et tempus mortuos judicandi," significat exitium illorum et Ultimum Judicium super illos, quibus non aliqua vita spiritualis est. - Per "iram Tuam" significatur Ultimum Judicium (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_340" target=_top>340</a>), ita exitium illorum; quod hoc per "iram Domini" significetur, est quia apparet illis sicut Dominus ex ira dejiciat illos in Infernum, cum tamen malus se ipsum conjicit; est enim sicut maleficus tribuat legi quod puniatur, aut igni quod uratur si manum immittit, aut ensi extenso in manu tutantis se, dum in mucronem incurrit, si transfigatur; sic fit cum unoquovis qui contra Dominum est, et ex ira ruit contra illos quos Dominus tutatur. Per "mortuos" qui judicandi sunt, in universali sensu intelliguntur mortui e mundo, in proprio autem sensu intelliguntur illi quibus non aliqua vita spiritualis est; de his praedicatur judicium, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_3_18" target=_top>Johannes 3:18</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_5_24" target=_top>5:24</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_5_29" target=_top>29</a>); causa est, quia "vivi" dicuntur quibus vita spiritualis est; vita spiritualis est unice apud illos qui Dominum adeunt, et simul fugiunt mala ut peccata. Illi quibus non aliqua vita spiritualis est, intelliguntur in his locis: <p>"Adhaeserunt Baalpeori et comederunt sacrificia Mortuorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_106_28" target=_top>Psalm 106:28</a>);<p>"Persequitur hostis animam meam, sedere me fecit in tenebris sicut Mortuos mundi," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_143_3" target=_top>Psalm 143:3</a>);<p>"Ad audiendum gemitum vincti, et ad aperiendum Filiis Mortis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_102_25" target=_top>Psalm 102:25</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_102_20" target=_top>20</a>));<p>"Novi opera tua, quod nomen habeas quod vivas, sed Mortuus es; esto vigilans, et stabili reliqua quae Moribunda sunt," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_1-2" target=_top>Apocalypsis 3:1-2</a>);<p>quod illi per "mortuos" intelligantur, est quia intelligitur mors spiritualis; quare etiam per "occisos" significantur qui illa morte exstincti sunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_321" target=_top>321</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_325" target=_top>325</a>, et alibi). Mortui autem e mundo intelliguntur per "mortuos" in his: <p>"Judicati sunt Mortui juxta ea quae scripta sunt in libris," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_12" target=_top>Apocalypsis 20:12</a>);<p>"Reliqui Mortui non revixerunt," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_525/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_5" target=_top>Apocalypsis 20:5</a>);<p>causa est quia per "mortem primam" intelligitur ibi mors naturalis quae est e mundo, et per "mortem secundam" mors spiritualis, quae est damnatio. </p>
