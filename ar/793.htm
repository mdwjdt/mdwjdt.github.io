<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第793节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>793.“各行手艺人在你中间决不能再遇见”表那些因教义和照之的生活陷入天主教的人，就他们自己而言，没有对属灵真理的任何理解，因而没有任何属灵真理的思维。就圣言的灵义而言，“手艺人”表示很聪明，以及出于理解的思考；在好的意义上表示出于理解思考真理，这是属天堂的；在坏的意义上表示出于理解思考虚假，这是属地狱的。由于后者和前者都多种多样，每一种都具有许多类型，而每一类型又具有许多种类和类型，然而它们都被称为具体和细节，故经上说没有“各行手艺人”。“手艺人”凭他们的技能和手艺通过对应而表示诸如属于智慧、聪明和知识的那类事物。之所以说“通过对应”，是因为人所做的一切工，以及一切操作，只要具有某种功用，皆对应于诸如属于天使聪明的那类事物。天使聪明的事务或主体有的对应于手艺人在金、银、宝石上所做的工；有的对应于手艺人在铜、铁、木、石上所做的工；有的对应于手艺人在其它可取功用上所做的工，如布料，亚麻织品，各种衣裳和服装。所有这些都相对应，如前所述，因为它们是所作的工。从这些事明显可知，“各行手艺人在巴比伦中间决不能再遇见”不是说那里将没有任何手艺人，而是说没有对属灵真理的任何理解，因而没有任何属灵真理的思维；不过，这种情形只在那些因教义和照之的生活陷入天主教的人身上，并且也就是就他们自己而言。</p><p>“手艺人”（或巧匠，工匠，匠人）表示那些处于对真理的理解，因而处于真理的思维之人，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>手艺人比撒列和亚何利亚伯将制造会幕，因为他们充满智慧，有聪明，有知识。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.3.htm">31:3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出36.1.htm">36:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出36.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>他们中间凡心里有智慧做工的，作帐幕，并用巧匠的手工。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出36.8.htm">36:8</a>）</p><p>你要作帐幕，要用捻的细麻和蓝色，紫色，朱红色线制造，并用巧匠的手工绣上基路伯。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.1.htm">26:1</a>）</p><p>你同样在幔子上以巧匠的手工绣上基路伯。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出 26.31.htm"> 26:31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出36.35.htm">36:35</a>）</p><p>用巧匠的手工做以弗得，以及胸牌。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.6.htm">28:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.8.htm">39:8</a>）</p><p>巧匠或手艺人还用一个也表示设计者的词来表述：</p><p>你要用宝石工匠的手工，刻这两块宝石，安在以弗得的两条肩带上。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出 28.11.htm"> 28:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出 28.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>就反面意义而言，“手艺人（或巧匠，工匠，匠人）的工”表示凭人自己的聪明所作的工，由此产生的，无非是虚假。在以下经文中，这一点由“手艺人（或巧匠，工匠，匠人）的工”来表示：</p><p>他们用银子照自己的聪明为自己铸造偶像，全都是匠人的工作。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何 13.2.htm"> 13:2</a>）</p><p>匠人铸造雕像，银匠用金包裹，为它铸造银链；他为自己寻找巧匠。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.19.htm">40:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.20.htm">20</a>）</p><p>他们在林中砍下木头，匠人用手工制成作品；银子是从他施带来的，并有从乌法来的金子，都是匠人的作品；又有蓝色紫色料的衣服，全都是巧匠的作品。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.3.htm">10:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>还有申命记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/申27.15.htm">27:15</a>）。“偶像”表示源于自我聪明的敬拜和宗教的虚假（参看<a href="459.htm">459</a>，<a href="460.htm">460</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 793</h4><p>793. "No craftsman of any craft shall be found in you anymore." This symbolically means that those caught up in the Roman Catholic religion because of its doctrine and a life in accordance with it are without any understanding of spiritual truth, and so are without any thought of spiritual truth, to the extent that they are left to themselves.<p>In the spiritual sense of the Word, a craftsman symbolizes an intelligent person and a thinking one by virtue of his intellect - in a good sense, someone who uses his intellect to think thoughts that are true, which are heavenly, and in a bad sense, someone who uses his intellect to think thoughts that are false, which are infernal. Moreover, because all of these thoughts are of many kinds, and each kind consists of many varieties, and each variety again of many kinds and varieties, but which we call particulars and specifics, therefore the text says, "no craftsman of any craft."<p>By virtue of their arts and crafts, too, and the correspondence of these, craftsmen symbolize such things as have to do with wisdom, intelligence and knowledge. We say, by virtue of their correspondence, because a person's every work, likewise his every undertaking, corresponds to such things as have to do with the intelligence of angels, provided it is of some use. But the works of craftsmen in gold, silver and precious stones correspond to some matters or objects of angelic intelligence, the works of craftsmen in bronze, iron, wood and stone to others, and the works of craftsmen in other valuable endeavors, such as the making of cloth, linens, garments and clothing of various kinds, to still others. All of these arts and crafts have, as we said, a correspondence, because they are works.<p>It can be seen from this that no craftsman of any art being found in Babylon does not mean that there will be no craftsman there, but that there will be no understanding of spiritual truth and so no thought of spiritual truth. But this is the case only with those who are caught up in the Roman Catholic religion because of its doctrine and a life in accordance with it, and this to the extent that they are left to themselves.</p><p>[2] That a craftsman symbolizes people who have an understanding of truth and so think thoughts that are true can be seen from this, that Bezaleel and Aholiab were to make the Tabernacle, because they were filled with wisdom, understanding, and knowledge (<a href="3927/exodus_31_3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_36_1.htm">36:1-2</a>). Also from the following:<p>All the wise-hearted among those doing the work made (the dwelling place) with the work of a craftsman... (<a href="3927/exodus_36_8.htm">Exodus 36:8</a>)<p>You shall make the dwelling place... of fine woven linen and blue, purple, and double-dyed scarlet...(and) cherubim; with the work of a craftsman you shall make them. (<a href="3927/exodus_26_1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>)<p>You shall make a veil (in the same manner) with the work of a craftsman. (<a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_36_35.htm">36:35</a>)<p>So, too, the ephod with the work of a craftsman, and also the breastpiece (<a href="3927/exodus_28_6.htm">Exodus 28:6</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_39_8.htm">39:8</a>). The word for craftsman there is one that also means a thinker.<p>With the work of a craftsman in gems..., you shall engrave the two stones... which you shall put... on the shoulders of the ephod... (<a href="3927/exodus_28_11.htm">Exodus 28:11</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_28_12.htm">12</a>)</p><p>[3] In an opposite sense, the work of a craftsman symbolizes the kind of work that is the product of one's own intelligence, from which comes only falsity. This is meant by the work of a craftsman in the following passages:<p>In their intelligence they will make... a molten image... of their silver..., all of it the work of craftsmen. (<a href="3927/hosea_13_2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>)<p>A craftsman pours the image, and the founder covers it with gold and forges chains of silver... He seeks... a wise craftsman... (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_19.htm">Isaiah 40:19-20</a>)<p>...one cuts wood from a forest, the work of the hands of the workman... Silver... is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of a craftsman...; blue and purple their clothing, all the work of wise men. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_10_3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_9.htm">9</a>)<p>See also <a href="3927/deuteronomy_27_15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>.<p>That idols symbolize falsities in worship and religion originating from people's own intelligence may be seen in no. 459, 460 above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 793</h4><p>793. 'And every craftsman of every craft shall not be found in thee any more' signifies that those who are in that form of religion by virtue of doctrine and a life in accordance with it do not have any understanding of spiritual truth, and consequently neither any thought of spiritual truth, so far as this is of themselves. By 'a craftsman' in the spiritual sense of the Word is signified being intelligent, also thinking out of the understanding; in a good sense thinking truths out of the understanding, which are heavenly; and in a bad sense thinking untruths out of the understanding, which are infernal. And as the latter and the former are of many kinds, and each kind of many species, and each species again of many kinds and species, which, however, are called particulars and details (singularia), therefore it is said 'craftsman of every craft.' By 'craftsman' also by virtue of their skills and crafts are signified from correspondence such things as are of wisdom, intelligence and knowledge. It is said 'from correspondence' because every work of man, likewise every operation if only it be of some use, corresponds to such things as are of angelic intelligence. But there are some matters or subjects of angelic intelligence pertaining to the works of craftsmen in gold, silver and precious stones; others pertaining to those of craftsmen in bronze, iron, wood and stone; and others pertaining to those of the craftsmen of other desirable uses, such as cloths, linens, garments and clothing of various kinds. All of these correspond, as has been said, because they are works. From these considerations it can be established that by the 'craftsman of every craft' who 'shall not be found' in Babylon, it is not understood that there shall be no craftsman there but that there will not be any understanding of spiritual truth, and consequently not any thought of spiritual truth either. But this is the case only with those who are in that form of religion by virtue of its doctrine and a life in accordance therewith, and also so far as this is of themselves.</p><p>[2] That 'a craftsman' signifies those who are in the understanding of truth and consequently in the thought of truth can be established from these passages:<p>Bezaleel and Ohohiab the craftsmen shall make the tabernacle because they are filled with wisdom, understanding, and knowledge, <a href="3927/exodus_30_13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_36_1.htm">36:1-2</a>.<p>Every one wise-hearted among those doing the work made the dwelling- place, the work of the craftsman, <a href="3927/exodus_36_8.htm">Exodus 36:8</a>.<p>Thou shalt make the dwelling-place of fine twined linen, and hyacinthine and purple, and double-dyed scarlet, and cherubs, with the work of the craftsman thou shalt make them, <a href="3927/exodus_26_1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>.<p>Thou shalt make the veil likewise with the work of the craftsman, <a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_35_35.htm">35:35</a>.<p>Likewise the ephod with the work of the craftsman; as also the breastplate, <a href="3927/exodus_28_6.htm">Exodus 28:6</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_39_8.htm">39:8</a>.<p>The 'craftsman' there is named by a word that also signifies a designer.<p>Thou shalt engrave two stones, which thou shalt put upon the shoulders of the ephod, with the work of a craftsman in gems, <a href="3927/exodus_28_11.htm">Exodus 28:11</a>.</p><p>[3] In the opposite sense by 'the work of a craftsman' is signified the kind of work that is derived from self-intelligence, out of which only what is false can be produced. This is understood by 'the work of the craftsman' in these places:<p>They shall make a molten image out of their silver in their own intelligence, all of it the work of craftsmen, <a href="3927/hosea_13_2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>.<p>The craftsman casts the graven image, and the founder spreads it over wills gold and forges silver chains; he seeks for a wise craftsman. <a href="3927/isaiah_40_19.htm">Isaiah 40:19-20</a>.<p>He cuts wood from the forest, the work of the hands of the workman. Silver is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz, the work of the craftsman; hyacinthine and purple, their clothing, all of them the work of wise ones. <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_9.htm">9</a>.<p>Also. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_27_15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>. That 'idols' signify the untruths of worship and religion derived from self-intelligence may be seen above (<a href="459.htm">459-460</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 793</h4><p>793. And no artificer of any art shall be found in thee anymore signifies that they who are in that religious persuasion from doctrine and from a life according to it, have no understanding of spiritual truth, and hence no thought of spiritual truth, so far as it is from themselves. By "an artificer" in the spiritual sense of the Word is signified one that is intelligent, and thinks from the understanding; in the good sense, one that from the understanding thinks truths, which are heavenly; and in the evil sense, one that from the understanding thinks falsities, which are infernal; and as the latter and the former are of many kinds, and each kind of many species, and each species again of many kinds and species, which, however, are called particulars and singulars, it is therefore said, "no artificer of any art." By artificers also, from their handicrafts and arts, such things are signified from correspondence as are of wisdom, intelligence, and knowledge. It is said, from correspondence, because all human work corresponds, and likewise every operation provided it be of any use, to such things as are of angelic intelligence. But the works of artificers in gold, silver, and precious stones correspond to one kind of matters or subjects of angelic intelligence; those of artificers in brass, iron, wood and stone to other kinds; and to others, those of artificers in other desirable uses, as cloths, linens, garments and clothings of various kinds. All these correspond, as has been said, because they are works. From these things it may appear, that by "an artificer of any art" shall not be found in Babylon, is not meant that there shall not be any artificers there, but that there will not be any understanding of spiritual truth, and thence no thought of spiritual truth; but this is only with those who are in that religious persuasion from its doctrine, and from a life according to it, and also as far as it is from themselves.</p><p>[2] That "an artificer" signifies those who are in the understanding of truth, and thence in the thought of truth, may appear from these passages:<p>Bezaleel and Aholiab the artificers shall make the tabernacle, for they are filled with wisdom, intelligence, and science, (<a href="3927/exodus_31_3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_36_1.htm">36:1-2</a>).<p>And everyone wise in heart among them doing the work, they made the habitation, the work of the artificer, (<a href="3927/exodus_36_8.htm">Exodus 36:8</a>).<p>Thou shalt make the habitation of fine twined linen, and blue and purple, and scarlet double-dyed, and cherubim, with the work of the artificer shalt thou make them, (<a href="3927/exodus_26_1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>).<p>Thou shalt make the veil in like manner with the work of the artificer, (<a href="3927/exodus_26_31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_35_35.htm">35:35</a>).<p>In like manner the ephod with the work of the artificer; as also the breastplate, (<a href="3927/exodus_28_6.htm">Exodus 28:6</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_39_8.htm">39:8</a>).<p>Artificer is there expressed by a word which also signifies a designer:<p>Thou shalt engrave two stones, which thou shalt put upon the shoulders of the ephod, with the work of an artificer in gems, (<a href="3927/exodus_28_11.htm">Exodus 28:11</a>).</p><p>[3] In the opposite sense, by "the work of an artificer" is signified that work which is done from one's own intelligence, from which nothing else can be produced but falsity. This is meant by "the work of the artificer" in these passages:<p>They shall make a molten image of their silver in their own intelligence, the whole the work of artificers, (<a href="3927/hosea_13_2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>).<p>The artificer casteth the graven image, and the founder spreadeth it over with gold, and maketh silver chains; he seeketh a wise artificer, (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_19.htm">Isaiah 40:19-20</a>).<p>He cutteth wood out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman; silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer; blue and purple are their garments, the whole the work of the wise, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_10_3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_9.htm">9</a>; also <a href="3927/deuteronomy_27_15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>).<p>That "idols" signify falsities of worship and religion from one's own intelligence, may be seen above, (<a href="459.htm">459</a>, <a href="460.htm">460</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 793 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>793. "Et omnis artifex omnis artis in te non invenietur amplius," significat quod illis qui in Religioso illo ex doctrina et ex vita secundum illam sunt, non sit aliquis intellectus veri spiritualis, et inde nec aliqua cogitatio veri spiritualis, quantum a se.--Per "artificem" in Sensu spirituali Verbi significatur intelligens, et ex intellectu cogitans; in sensu bono ex intellectu cogitans vera, quae caelestia, et in sensu malo ex intellectu cogitans falsa, quae infernalia: et quia haec et illa sunt plurium generum, et quodlibet genus plurium specierum, et quaelibet species iterum plurium generum et specierum, quae tamen particularia et singularia vocantur, ideo dicitur "artifex omnis artis:" etiam per "artifices," ex artificiis et artibus eorum, ex correspondentia significantur talia quae sapientiae, intelligentiae et scientiae sunt. Ex correspondentia dicitur, quia omne opus hominis correspondet, similiter omnis operatio, modo sit alicujus usus, talibus quae intelligentiae angelicae sunt; ast aliis rebus aut subjectis intelligentiae angelicae, quae artificum auri, argenti et lapidum pretiosorum sunt, aliis quae artificum aeris, ferri, ligni et lapidis sunt, et aliis quae artificum aliorum usuum desiderabilium sunt, ut pannorum, linteorum, vestium, et indumentorum varii generis. Haec omnia correspondent, ut dictum est, quia sunt opera. Ex his constare potest, quod per "artificem omnis artis," qui non invenietur in Babylone, non intelligatur quod non aliquis artifex ibi, sed quod non aliquis intellectus veri spiritualis, et inde nec aliqua cogitatio veri spiritualis; sed ita solum illis, qui in Religioso illo ex doctrina ejus et ex vita secundum illam sunt, et quoque quantum ex se. Quod "artifex" significet illos qui in intellectu veri sunt, et inde in cogitatione veri, constare potest ex his: <p>Bezaleel et Aholiabus Artifices facient Tabernaculum, quia impleti sapientia, intelligentia, et scientia, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_793/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_31_3" target=_top>Exodus 31:3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_793/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_36_1-2" target=_top>36:1-2</a>);<p>"Fecerunt, omnis sapiens corde inter facientes opus, habitaculum, opere Artificis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_793/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_36_8" target=_top>Exodus 36:8</a>);<p>"Facies Habitaculum, xylinum intertextum, et hyacinthinum et purpuram, et coccineum dibaphum, et cherubos; opere Artificis facies illa," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_793/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_26_1" target=_top>Exodus 26:1</a>);<p>"Facies velum" similiter "opere Artificis," ((<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_793/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_26_1-37" target=_top>Exodus 26</a>) vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_793/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_26_31" target=_top>31</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_793/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_35_35" target=_top>35:35</a>);<p>Similiter Ephodum opere Artificis: ut et Pectorale, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_793/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_28_6" target=_top>Exodus 28:6</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_793/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_39_8" target=_top>39:8</a>);<p>artifex ibi nominatur voce quae etiam significat Excogitatorem. <p>"Sculpes duos lapides" quos pones super humeris Ephodi, "opere Artificis gemmarum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_793/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_28_11" target=_top>Exodus 28:11</a>).<p>In opposito sensu per "opus artificis" significatur id opus quod fit ex propria intelligentia, ex qua non aliud produci potest quam falsum.
