Here it symbolizes also a manifestation, because John says, "I looked, and behold...." And because he saw then the things related in this chapter, which have to do with the organization of the heavens for a last judgment by the Lord, to take place in accordance with His Divine truths in the Word, therefore the statement, "I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven," symbolizes a manifestation of those things. </p>

"And when the animals gave glory, and honor, and thanks to Him that sat upon the throne," signifies that the Word ascribes all truth, and all good, and all worship to the Lord Who is to judge, (<a href="249.htm">249</a>). "Who liveth for ages of ages," signifies that the Lord alone is life, and that life eternal is from Him alone, (<a href="250.htm">250</a>).<p>Verse 10. "The four-and-twenty elders fell down before Him that sat on the throne, and adored Him that liveth for ages of ages," signifies the humiliation of all in heaven before the Lord (it. 251). "And cast their crowns before the throne," signifies the acknowledgment that their wisdom is from Him alone, (<a href="252.htm">252</a>).<p>Verse 11." Saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power," signifies that the kingdom is the Lord's by merit and justice, because He is the Divine truth and the Divine good, (<a href="253.htm">253</a>). "For Thou hast created all things, and by Thy will they are, and were created," signifies that all things of heaven and the church were made and formed, and men reformed and regenerated from the Lord's Divine love by His Divine wisdom, or from His Divine good by His Divine truth, which also is the Word.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original Latin omits "burning."<br><br>THE EXPLANATION<br><br>Verse 1. After these things I saw, and behold a door opened in heaven, signifies the manifestation of the arrangement of the heavens preparatory to the Last Judgment from the Lord, about to be performed according to His Divine truths in the Word. By "an open door," when it relates to heaven, is signified admission, as above, (<a href="176.htm">176</a>); here, also, manifestation, because he says, "I saw and behold;" and because then were seen the things which are recorded in this chapter, which refer to the arrangement of the heavens for the Last Judgment by the Lord, to be executed according to His Divine truths in the Word, therefore by "I saw, and behold a door opened in heaven," is signified a manifestation concerning them. </p>
