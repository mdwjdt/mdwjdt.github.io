<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第633节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>633.启14:9.“又有第三位天使，接着他们，大声说”表主进一步揭露那些陷入与仁分离之信的人。“第三位天使接着他们”表示按照顺序，主接下来进一步揭露的事，因为“天使”在至高意义上表示主（<a href="626.htm">626</a>节）。原因在于，一位天使在说圣言时，如此处的情形，并不是凭自己说的，而是凭着主。“大声说”表示接下来的事，这些事涉及那些在生活和教义上确认与仁分离之信的人所受的谴责。本章1-5节论述了新基督天堂；6-7节论述了对福音，也就是主降临建立新教会的传扬；由于那些陷入与仁分离之信的人反对这一切，故接下来是对那些仍坚持唯信之人的威慑和谴责。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 633</h4><p>633. <a href="3927/revelation_14_9.htm">14:9</a> Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice. This symbolizes still more from the Lord concerning people caught up in faith divorced from charity.<p>A third angel following the prior ones symbolizes still more from the Lord that follows in the line of thought, for in the highest sense an angel means the Lord (no. <a href="626.htm">626</a>). That is because, when an angel utters the Word, as in the present instance, he does not speak on his own, but from the Lord. To say with a loud voice symbolizes what follows, the subject of which is the damnation of those people who in life and in doctrine confirm themselves in a faith divorced from charity.<p>The subject in verses <a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">1-5</a> of this chapter is the New Christian Heaven, and in verses <a href="3927/revelation_14_6.htm">6</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_14_7.htm">7</a> a preaching of the gospel, namely, the gospel of the Lord's advent to establish a new church. And because people caught up in a faith divorced from charity stand in the way, there follows now the threat and warning of damnation to people who still persist in that faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 633</h4><p>633. [verse 9] 'And a third angel followed them saying with a great voice' signifies something further from the Lord concerning those who are in faith separated from charity. By 'a third angel followed them' is signified something further from the Lord that follows in order, for by 'an angel' in the highest sense is understood the Lord (<a href="626.htm">626</a>). This is because an angel, while he is speaking the Word, as here, is not speaking from himself but from the Lord. By 'to say with a great voice' is signified what follows, which concerns the damnation of those who in life and doctrine confirm themselves in faith separated from charity. From verses 1-5 of this chapter it treats of the Christian New Heaven, and in verses 6-7 of the preaching of the gospel, that is, of the coming of the Lord to set up the New Church; and because those who are in faith separated from charity oppose this, there now follows a threatening and denunciation of damnation for those who still persist in that faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 633</h4><p>633. Verse 9. And a third angel followed them, saying with a great voice, signifies something further from the Lord concerning those who are in faith separated from charity. By "a third angel following them," is signified something further from the Lord which follows in order, for by "an angel," in the highest sense, is meant the Lord, (<a href="626.htm">626</a>). The reason is, because an angel, when he speaks the Word, as here, does not speak from himself, but from the Lord. By "saying with a great voice," is signified what follows, which relates to the damnation of those who in life and doctrine confirm themselves in faith separated from charity. This chapter, from verse 1-5, treats of the New Christian Heaven; and in verses 6, 7, of the preaching of the gospel, that is, of the Lord's advent to establish the New Church; and because they who are in faith separated from charity oppose this, there now follows a threatening and denunciation of damnation against those who still persist in that faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 633 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>633. (Vers. 9.) "Et tertius Angelus secutus est illos, dicens voce magna," significat adhuc a Domino de illis qui in Fide separata a charitate.--Per "tertium Angelum secutum illos" significatur adhuc a Domino quod sequitur in ordine, nam per "Angelum" in supremo Sensu intelligitur Dominus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_633/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_626" target=_top>626</a>); causa est, quia Angelus dum loquitur Verbum, ut hic, non loquitur a se sed a Domino per "dicere voce magna" significatur id quod sequitur, quod est de damnatione illorum qui se vita et doctrina confirmant in Fide separata a charitate. A versu 1 ad 5 hujus capitis actum est de Novo Caelo Christiano; et vers. 6, 7, de praedicatione Evangelii, hoc est, Adventus Domini ad instaurandum Novam Ecclesiam; et quia illi qui in Fide separata a charitate obstant, sequitur nunc comminatio et denuntiatio damnationis ad illos qui adhuc in illa fide perseverant. </p>
