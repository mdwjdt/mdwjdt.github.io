<p>20.“又使我们作王和祭司”表祂恩赐那些从祂而生，也就是重生的人处在源自神性真理的智慧和源自神性良善的爱中。众所周知，在圣言中，主被称为“王”，也被称为“祭司”。祂因其神性智慧而被称为“王”，因其神性之爱而被称为“祭司”。因此，那些通过主处于智慧的人被称为“王的众子”，以及“王”；那些通过主处于爱的人则被称为“用人”（ministers）和“祭司”。因为智慧与爱并非出于他们自己，因而不是他们自己的，而是主的。故在圣言中，这些人由“君王”和“祭司”来表示，不是说他们是“君王”和“祭司”，而是说住在他们里面的主是，并使得他们被如此称呼。他们还被称为“从祂生的”、“天国之子”、“父的众子”、“产业”（heirs）、“从他生的”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.12.htm">1:12</a>、13），也就是再生或重生的（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.3.htm">3:3</a>等）；“天国的子民”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太8.12.htm">8:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.38.htm">13:38</a>）；“天父的儿子”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.45.htm">5:45</a>）；“产业”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗127.3.htm">127:3</a>；撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上2.8.htm">2:8</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.34.htm">25:34</a>）。他们因被称为产业、天国之子和从为他们父的主生的，故也被称为“君王和祭司”。论到他们，经上说：</p><p>他们要在主的宝座上与祂同坐。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.21.htm">3:21</a>）</p><p>整个天堂有两个国度，被分为属灵国度和属天国度。属灵国度就是那被称为主的王权的，住于其间的人皆处于源自真理的智慧，故由“王”来表示；从主获得智慧的人，主皆使他们成为“王”。属天国度就那被称为主的祭司的，住于其间的人皆处于源自良善的爱，故由“祭司”来表示；住于来自主的爱之人，主皆使他们成为“祭司”。主在地上的教会以同样的方式分为两个国度，关于这两个国度，可参看1758年于伦敦出版的《天堂与地狱》一书（<a href="../hh/24.htm">24</a>，<a href="../hh/226.htm">226</a>节）。</p><p>人若不了解“君王和祭司”的灵义，可能会因先知书和启示录对于他们所讲述的许多事而产生幻觉，如先知书说：</p><p>外邦人必建筑你的城墙，他们的王必服事你；你也必吃外邦列国的奶，又吮列王的乳；你便知道我耶和华是你的救主，是你的救赎主。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.10.htm">60:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.16.htm">16</a>）</p><p>列王必作你的养父、王后必作你的乳母。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.23.htm">49:23</a>）</p><p>还有其它地方，如创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.20.htm">49:20</a>）、诗篇（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗2.10.htm">2:10</a>）、以赛亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.9.htm">14:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.21.htm">24:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛52.15.htm">52:15</a>）、耶利米书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.26.htm">2:26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.9.htm">4:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.3.htm">49:3</a>）、耶利米哀歌（<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.6.htm">2:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.9.htm">9</a>）、以西结书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结7.26.htm">7:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结7.27.htm">27</a>）、何西阿书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/何3.4.htm">3:4</a>）、西番雅书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.8.htm">1:8</a>）。在这些经文中，“王”不是指君王，而是指那些从主获得神性真理的人，抽象而言，就是神性真理本身，智慧就源于这神性真理。彼此交战的“南方王”和“北方王”（但以理书11章等）也不是指君王，“南方王”是指那些处于真理的人，“北方王”是指处于虚假的人。</p><p>启示录中频繁提到“王”的地方也是如此，如这些经文：</p><p>第六位天使把碗倒在幼发拉底大河上，河水就干了，要给那从日出之地所来的众王预备道路。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.12.htm">16:12</a>）</p><p>地上的君王与坐在众水上的大淫妇行淫。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.2.htm">17:2</a>）</p><p>列族都喝了巴比伦邪淫大怒的酒，地上的君王与她行淫。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.3.htm">18:3</a>）</p><p>我看见那兽和地上的君王，并他们的众军都聚集，要与骑白马的争战。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.19.htm">19:19</a>）</p><p>得救的列族要在祂的光里行走，地上的君王必将自己的荣耀和尊贵归与新耶路撒冷。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.24.htm">21:24</a>）</p><p>还有其它地方（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.14.htm">16:14</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.2.htm">17:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.9.htm">9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.14.htm">14</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.9.htm">18:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.10.htm">10</a>）。此处“王”表示那些处于真理的人，在相反的意义上则表示那些处于虚假的人；抽象而言，表示真理或虚假。“巴比伦与地上的君王行淫”表示对教会真理的歪曲。很明显，巴比伦或骑在朱红色兽上的女人并没有与君王行淫，而是说她歪曲了圣言的真理。</p><p>由此明显可知，主要使从祂获得智慧的人作王，非指他们将成为君王，而指他们将变得智慧。甚至得到启示的理性也明白确是如此。故在以下经文：</p><p>你叫我们归向我们的神，成为君王和祭司，在地上掌权。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.10.htm">5:10</a>）</p><p>主就是“王”所表示的真理，这一点从祂回复彼拉多的话可知：</p><p>彼拉多就对他说，这样，你是王吗？耶稣回答，你说我是王，我为此而生，也为此来到世间，特为给真理作见证。凡属真理的人就听我的声音。彼拉多对祂说，真理是什么呢？（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约18.37.htm">18:37</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约18.38.htm">38</a>）</p><p>“给真理作见证”表示祂自己就是真理，祂也因此自称为“王”。彼拉多问：“真理是什么？”意思是问：“真理是王吗？”至于“祭司”表示那些住于爱之良善的人，抽象而言，表示爱之良善，这可见于下文。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 20</h4><p>20. And makes us kings and priests. (<a href="3927/revelation_1_6.htm">1:6</a>) This symbolically means, who grants those who are born from Him, that is, who are reborn or regenerated, to be governed by wisdom from Divine truths, and by love from Divine goods.<p>People know that in the Word the Lord is called a king and also a priest. He is called a king owing to His Divine wisdom, and a priest owing to His Divine love. People who are governed by wisdom from the Lord are consequently called children of the king, and also kings, while people who are governed by love from Him are called ministers and priests. For the wisdom and the love in them do not originate from them, and so are not theirs but the Lord's. It is these people who are therefore meant in the Word by kings and priests. Not that they are kings and priests, but that they have the Lord in them, and He causes them to be termed such.<p>Such people are called also children born of Him, children of the kingdom, children of the Father, and heirs - children born of Him in <a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>ff.), children of the kingdom in <a href="3927/matthew_8_12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_13_38.htm">13:38</a>, children of their Father in heaven in <a href="3927/matthew_5_45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>, and heirs in <a href="3927/psalms_127_3.htm">Psalms 127:3</a>, <a href="3927/1-samuel_2_8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>. And being heirs, children of the kingdom, and children born of the Lord as their Father, they are therefore called kings and priests. Moreover, in <a href="3927/revelation_3_21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a> it is also said that they will sit with the Lord on His throne.</p><p>[2] The whole of heaven has been divided into two kingdoms - the spiritual kingdom and the celestial kingdom. The spiritual kingdom is what is called the Lord's kingship, and because all who are in it are governed by wisdom founded on truths, therefore it is they who are meant by the kings that the Lord will make those people who are governed by wisdom from Him. The celestial kingdom, on the other hand, is what is called the Lord's priesthood, and because all who are in it are governed by love arising from goodness, therefore it is they who are meant by the priests that the Lord will make those people who are governed by love from Him. The Lord's church on earth is likewise divided into two kingdoms. Regarding these two kingdoms, see nos. <a href="24.htm">24</a>, <a href="226.htm">226</a> in the book Heaven and Hell, published in London, 1758.</p><p>[3] Someone who does not know the spiritual meaning of kings and priests may be deluded in regard to many things said in the prophets and in the book of Revelation about them. For example, in regard to these statements in the prophets:<p>The sons of foreigners shall build up your walls, and their kings shall minister to you... You shall suck the milk of gentiles, even the breasts of kings you shall suck, that you may know that I, Jehovah, am your Savior and your Redeemer... (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_10.htm">Isaiah 60:10</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_60_16.htm">16</a>)<p>Kings shall be your foster fathers, and their princesses your wet nurses. (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>)<p>Also elsewhere, as in <a href="3927/genesis_49_20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_2_10.htm">Psalms 2:10</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_14_9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_24_21.htm">24:21</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_52_15.htm">52:15</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_2_26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_9.htm">4:9</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_49_3.htm">49:3</a>; <a href="3927/lamentations_2_6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a>, <a href="3927/lamentations_2_9.htm">9</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_7_26.htm">Ezekiel 7:26-27</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_3_4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>; <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_8.htm">Zephaniah 1:8</a>. Kings there do not mean kings, but people who are governed by Divine truths from the Lord, and abstractly, Divine truths themselves, from which comes wisdom.<p>"The king of the south" and "the king of the north" who waged war with each other in <a href="3927/daniel_11_1.htm">Daniel 11</a> do not mean kings either, but the king of the south means people who are governed by truths, and the king of the north people who are caught up in falsities.</p><p>[4] Likewise in the book of Revelation, which many times mentions kings, as in the following passages:<p>The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, so that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared. (<a href="3927/revelation_16_12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>)<p>(With) the great harlot who sits on many waters... the kings of the earth committed whoredom... (<a href="3927/revelation_17_1.htm">Revelation 17:1-2</a>)<p>...of the wine of the wrath of (Babylon's) whoredom all the nations have drunk, and the kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her... (<a href="3927/revelation_18_3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>)<p>And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war with Him who sat on the (white) horse... (<a href="3927/revelation_19_19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a>)<p>And the nations that are saved shall walk in His light, and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honor into (the New Jerusalem). (<a href="3927/revelation_21_24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>)<p>Elsewhere also, as in <a href="3927/revelation_16_14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_17_9.htm">17:9-14</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_18_9.htm">18:9-10</a>. The kings there means people who are governed by truths, and in an opposite sense, people caught up in falsities, and abstractly, truths or falsities themselves. The whoredom of Babylon with the kings of the earth means the falsification of the truth of the church. Obviously Babylon, or the woman who sat on the scarlet beast, did not commit whoredom with kings, but rather falsified truths of the Word.</p><p> [5] It is apparent from this that the Lord's going to make people who are wise from Him kings does not mean that they will be kings, but that they will be wise. The reality of this is also something that enlightened reason sees.<p>Likewise in the following:<p>You have made us kings and priests to our God, that we may reign on the earth. (<a href="3927/revelation_5_10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>)<p>That by king the Lord meant truth is apparent from His words to Pilate:<p>Pilate... said to Him, "Are You a king then?"<p>Jesus answered, "As you have said, because I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice."<p>Pilate said to Him, "What is truth?" (<a href="3927/john_18_27.htm">John 18:27</a>, <a href="3927/john_18_38.htm">38</a>)<p>To bear witness to the truth is to be Himself the embodiment of truth. And because He called Himself a king by virtue of it, Pilate said, "What is truth?" - which is to say, "Is truth a king?<p>As for priests, we will see in later explanations that they symbolize people who are governed by the goodness of love, and abstractly, goods of love themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 20</h4><p>20. [Verse 6] 'And He makes us kings and priests' signifies Who grants that those who are born from Him, that is, regenerated, are in wisdom derived from Divine truths and in love derived from Divine goods. It is known that in the Word the Lord is termed 'King' and also 'Priest': 'King' is said on account of the Divine Wisdom and 'Priest' on account of the Divine Love. Those, therefore, who from the Lord are in wisdom are called 'the king's sons' and also 'kings,' and those who are in love from Him are called 'ministers' and 'priests'; for the wisdom and love with them is not from them, thus it is not their's but the Lord's. Consequently such persons are understood in the Word by 'kings' and 'priests'; not that they are [kings and priests], but the Lord in them is such, and causes them to be so named. They are also called born of Him, sons of the kingdom, sons of the Father, and heirs: 'born of Him' (<a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>), that is, born anew or regenerated (<a href="3927/john_3_1.htm">John 3:1</a> seq).; 'sons of the kingdom' (<a href="3927/matthew_8_12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_13_38.htm">13:38</a>); 'sons of the Father in heaven' (<a href="3927/matthew_5_45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>); 'heirs' (<a href="3927/psalms_127_3.htm">Psalms 127:3</a>; <a href="3927/1-samuel_2_8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>); and since they are said to be heirs, sons of the kingdom, and born of the Lord as a Father, they are therefore called 'kings and priests.' Then also it is said that they are 'going to sit with the Lord in His throne' (<a href="3927/revelation_3_21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>).</p><p>[2] There are two kingdoms into which the entire heaven is divided the spiritual kingdom and the celestial kingdom. The spiritual kingdom is what is called the Lord's royalty, and since all who are there are in wisdom derived from truths, therefore they are understood by the 'kings,' which the Lord will make those who are in wisdom from Him; and the celestial kingdom is what is called the Lord's priesthood, and since all who are there are in love derived from goods, therefore those are understood by the 'priests,' which the Lord will make those who are in love from Him. In like manner the Lord's Church on earth (in terris) is divided into two kingdoms; concerning which two kingdoms [something] may be seen in the work, published at London in the year 1758, on <a href="../hh/24.htm">HEAVEN AND HELL 24</a>, <a href="../hh/226.htm">226</a>).</p><p>[3] He who does not know the spiritual signification of 'kings and priests' can be deluded in regard to many things that are related about them in the Prophets and in the Apocalypse; as in these in the Prophets:<p>The sons of the strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: thou shalt suck the breasts of kings, that thou mayest know that I Jehovah am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer. <a href="3927/isaiah_60_10.htm">Isaiah 60:10</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_60_16.htm">16</a>.<p>Kings shall be thy nursing fathers and their princesses thy nursing mothers. <a href="3927/isaiah_49_23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>, and elsewhere, as in. <a href="3927/genesis_49_20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_2_10.htm">Psalms 2:10</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_14_9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_24_21.htm">24:21</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_52_15.htm">52:15</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_2_26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_9.htm">4:9</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_9.htm">9</a>; <a href="3927/lamentations_2_6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a>, <a href="3927/lamentations_2_9.htm">9</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_7_26.htm">Ezekiel 7:26-27</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_3_4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>; <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_8.htm">Zephaniah 1:8</a>. By 'kings' there, are understood not kings, but those who are in Divine truths from the Lord, and abstractly the Divine Truths from which wisdom is derived. Nor are kings understood by 'the king of the south' and 'the king of the north' who waged war with each other (<a href="3927/daniel_11_1.htm">Daniel 11</a> seq)., but by 'the king of the south' those are understood who are in truths, and by 'the king of the north' those who are in untruths.</p><p>[4] In like manner in the Apocalypse, where 'kings' are frequently named, as in these passages:<p>The sixth angel poured out his phial upon the great river Euphrates, and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepare. <a href="3927/revelation_16_12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>.<p>The kings of the land have committed fornication with the great harlot sitting upon many water. <a href="3927/revelation_17_2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a>.<p>All the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of the whoredom of Babylon, and the kings of the land have committed whoredom with her. <a href="3927/revelation_18_3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>.<p>And I saw the beast and the kings of the land, and their armies gathered together to make war with the One sitting upon the white horse. <a href="3927/revelation_19_19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a>.<p>And the nations that are saved shall walk in His light, and the kings of the land shall bring their glory and honour into the New Jerusalem. <a href="3927/revelation_21_24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>, and elsewhere, as chapters, <a href="3927/revelation_16_14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_17_2.htm">17:2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_17_9.htm">9-14</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_18_9.htm">18:9-10</a>. By the 'kings' there are understood those who are in truths and in the opposite sense those who are in untruths, and abstractly things true or false. By the whoredom of Babylon with the kings of the land the falsification of the truths of the Church is understood. It is an established fact that Babylon, or the woman who sat upon the scarlet coloured beast, has not committed whoredom with kings, but has falsified the truths of the Word.</p><p>[5] It is plain from these [considerations] that by the 'kings' that the Lord is going to make those who are wise from Him, is not understood that they are going to be kings but that they will be wise. That this is so, even enlightened reason sees. Similarly in the following:<p>Thou hast made us unto our God kings and priests, that we may reign over the land. <a href="3927/revelation_5_10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>.<p>That the Lord understood the truth (veritas) by 'a king' is plain from His words to Pilate:<p>Pilate said unto Him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou hast said. Because I am the King, I was born for this, and came into the world for this, that I should bear witness to the truth (veritas). Everyone who is of the truth (veritas) hears My voice. Pilate said unto Him, What is the truth (veritas)? <a href="3927/john_18_37.htm">John 18:37-38</a>.<p>To bear witness to the truth (veritas) is [equivalent to] Himself being the Truth (Veritas); and since He was calling Himself 'King' on account of that, Pilate said, 'What is the truth?,' that is, Is the truth a king? That 'priests' signify those who are in the good of love, and abstractly the goods of love, will be seen in the things following. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 20</h4><p>20. Verse 6. And maketh us kings and priests, signifies who gives to those who are born of Him, that is, who are regenerated, to be in wisdom from Divine truths, and in love from Divine goods. It is known that in the Word the Lord is called "king," and also "priest;" He is called "king" from Divine wisdom, and "priest" from Divine love; therefore, they who are in wisdom from the Lord are called "sons of the king," and also "kings;" and they who are in love from Him, are called "ministers" and "priests;" for the wisdom and love with them is not from themselves, thus not their own, but the Lord's. Hence it is that these are meant in the Word by "kings" and "priests;" not that they are such, but that the Lord is such in them, and causes them to be so called. They are also called "born of Him," "sons of the kingdom," "sons of the Father," and "heirs;" "born of him" (<a href="3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>), that is, born again, or regenerated, (<a href="3927/john_3_3.htm">John 3:3</a> seq.); "sons of the kingdom" (<a href="3927/matthew_8_12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_13_38.htm">13:38</a>); "sons of the Father in heaven" (<a href="3927/matthew_5_45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>); "heirs" (<a href="3927/psalms_127_3.htm">Psalms 127:3</a>; <a href="3927/1-samuel_2_8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>); and because they are called heirs, sons of the kingdom, and born of the Lord as their Father, they are called "kings and priests;" then also it is said that:<p>They all sit with the Lord upon His throne, (<a href="3927/revelation_3_21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>).</p><p>[2] There are two kingdoms into which the entire heaven is distinguished, the spiritual kingdom and the celestial kingdom; the spiritual kingdom is what is called the Lord's royalty, and as all who are therein are in wisdom from truths, therefore they are meant by "the kings," which the Lord will make those men who are in wisdom from Him; and the celestial kingdom is what is called the Lord's priesthood, and because all who are there, are in love from goods, therefore they are meant by "priests," which the Lord will make those men who are in love from Him: in like manner, the Lord's church upon earth is distinguished into two kingdoms; concerning those two kingdoms, see the work on Heaven and, (<a href="../hh/24.htm">Heaven and Hell 24</a>) (<a href="../hh/226.htm">Heaven and Hell 226</a>) Hell, published in London in the year 1758 (<a href="24.htm">24</a>, <a href="226.htm">226</a>).</p><p>[3] He who does not know the spiritual signification of "kings and priests," may be hallucinated <sup>1</sup>by many things which are related concerning them in the prophets and in Revelation; as in these in the prophets:<p>The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee; thou shalt suck the milk of the Gentiles, yea thou shalt suck the breasts of kings; that thou mayest know that I Jehovah am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_10.htm">Isaiah 60:10</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_60_16.htm">16</a>).<p>Kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their princesses thy nursing mothers, (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>). And in other places, as in, (<a href="3927/genesis_49_20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_2_10.htm">Psalms 2:10</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_14_9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_24_21.htm">24:21</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_52_15.htm">52:15</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_2_26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_9.htm">4:9</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_19_3.htm">19:3</a>; <a href="3927/lamentations_2_6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a> (, <a href="3927/lamentations_2_9.htm">9</a>); <a href="3927/ezekiel_7_26.htm">Ezekiel 7:26-27</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_3_4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>; <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_8.htm">Zephaniah 1:8</a>). By "kings" in these passages, kings are not meant, but those who are in Divine truths from the Lord, and abstractly Divine truths, from which is wisdom. Neither are kings meant by "the king of the south" and "the king of the north" who waged war with each other, (<a href="3927/daniel_11_1.htm">Daniel 11:1</a>); but by "the king of the south" are meant those who are in truths, and by "the king of the north" those who are in falsities.</p><p>[4] In like manner in Revelation, where kings are frequently mentioned; as in these passages:<p>The sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates, and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared, (<a href="3927/revelation_16_12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>).<p>The kings of the earth have committed whoredom with the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters, (<a href="3927/revelation_17_2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a>).<p>All nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of the whoredom of Babylon, and the kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her, (<a href="3927/revelation_18_3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>).<p>And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to make war with Him that sitteth on the white horse, (<a href="3927/revelation_19_19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a>).<p>And the nations which are saved shall walk in His light, and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honor into the New Jerusalem, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>);<p>and in other places (as in <a href="3927/revelation_16_14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_17_2.htm">17:2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_17_9.htm">9-14</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_18_9.htm">18:9-10</a>). By kings are here meant those who are in truths, and, in the opposite sense those who are in falsities; and abstractly, truths or falsities. By "the whoredom of Babylon with the kings of the earth" is meant the falsification of the truth of the church; that Babylon, or the woman who sat upon the scarlet beast, did not commit whoredom with the kings, but that she falsified the truths of the Word, is evident.</p><p>[5] From this it is evident that by "kings," that the Lord will make those who are in wisdom from Him, is not meant that they will be kings, but that they will be wise. That this is so, enlightened reason also sees. So in the following:<p>Thou hast made us unto our God kings and priests, that we may reign upon the earth, (<a href="3927/revelation_5_10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>).<p>That the Lord, by "a king," meant truth, is evident from his own words to Pilate:<p>Pilate said unto Him, Art thou not a king then? Jesus answered, Thou hast said that I am a king. For this was I born, and for this I came into the world, that I should give testimony to the truth; everyone that is of the truth heareth My voice. Pilate saith unto Him, What is truth? (<a href="3927/john_18_37.htm">John 18:37-38</a>).<p>"To bear witness unto the truth," means that He Himself is the truth; and because from it He called Himself "a king," Pilate said, "What is truth," that is, is truth a king? That "priests" signify those who are in the good of love, and abstractly the goods of love, will appear in what follows.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;deceived </p>
