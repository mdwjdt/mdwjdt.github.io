<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第874节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>874.启20:15.“若发现有人没记在生命册上，他就被扔在火湖里”表那些没有照主圣言中的诫命生活，也不信主的人被判罚。“生命册”表示圣言，“照生命册受审判”表示照着圣言真理受审判（参看<a href="256.htm">256</a>，<a href="259.htm">259</a>，<a href="295.htm">295</a>，<a href="303.htm">303</a>，<a href="309.htm">309</a>，<a href="317.htm">317</a>，<a href="324.htm">324</a>，<a href="330.htm">330</a>节）；除了照主圣言中的诫命而生活并信主者之外，“生命册”上找不到其他任何人。因此，所表示的是这一切。凡不照主圣言中的诫命生活的人的，皆被判罚，主在约翰福音中教导说：</p><p>若有人听见我的话不相信，我不审判他，有审判他的；就是我所讲的道在末日要审判他。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.47.htm">12:47</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.48.htm">48</a>）</p><p>凡不信主的，皆被判罚；主在约翰福音中还教导说：</p><p>信子的人有永生，不信子的人不得见永生，神的震怒常在他身上。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.36.htm">3:36</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 874</h4><p>874. <a href="3927/revelation_20_15.htm">20:15</a> And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire. This symbolically means that those who had not lived in accordance with the Lord's commandments in the Word and did not believe in the Lord were condemned.<p>That the Book of Life symbolizes the Word, and to be judged on the basis of that book means, symbolically, to be judged in accordance with the Word's truths, may be seen in nos. <a href="256.htm">256</a>, <a href="259.htm">259</a>, <a href="295.htm">295</a>, <a href="302.htm">302</a>, <a href="309.htm">309</a>, <a href="317.htm">317</a>, <a href="324.htm">324</a>, <a href="330.htm">330</a> above. Moreover, no one is found written in the Book of Life but someone who has lived in accordance with the Lord's commandments in the Word, and who believed in the Lord. This, therefore, is what is meant.<p>That someone who does not live in accordance with the Lord's commandments in the Word is condemned, is something that the Lord teaches in John:<p>If anyone hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him... (He) has that which judges him: the Word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day. (<a href="3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>)<p>And that someone who does not believe in the Lord is condemned, also in John:<p>He who believes in the Son has eternal life, while he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him. (<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 874</h4><p>874. [verse 15] 'And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire' signifies that those who did not live in accordance with the Lord's precepts in the Word, and did not believe in the Lord, were condemned. That by 'the book of life' is signified the Word, and by 'to be judged out of that book' is signified in accordance with the truths of the Word, may be seen above (<a href="256.htm">256</a>, <a href="259.htm">259</a>, <a href="295.htm">295</a>, <a href="302.htm">302</a>, <a href="309.htm">309</a>, <a href="317.htm">317</a>, <a href="324.htm">324</a>, <a href="330.htm">330</a>); and no other is 'found written in the book of life' but he who has lived in accordance with the Lord's precepts in the Word and has believed in the Lord. This therefore is understood. That he who does not live in accordance with the Lord's precepts in the Word is condemned, the Lord teaches in John:<p>If anyone hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him; he has that which judges him, the Word that I have spoken; that shall judge him in the last day. <a href="3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>; and that he who does not believe in the Lord is condemned, also in John:<p>He who believes in the Son has eternal life, but he who does not believe in the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him. <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 874</h4><p>874. Verse 15. And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire, signifies that they who did not live according to the Lord's commandments in the Word, and did not believe in the Lord, were condemned. That by "the book of life" is signified the Word, and by "being judged out of that book," is signified to be judged according to the truths of the Word, may be seen above, (<a href="256.htm">256</a>, <a href="259.htm">259</a>, <a href="295.htm">295</a>, <a href="303.htm">303</a>, <a href="309.htm">309</a>, <a href="317.htm">317</a>, <a href="324.htm">324</a>, <a href="330.htm">330</a>); and no other is found written in the book of life but he who has lived according to the Lord's commandments in the Word, and has believed in the Lord; this therefore is meant. That he who does not live according to the Lord's commandments in the Word, is condemned, the Lord teaches in John:<p>And if anyone hear My words and believe not, I judge him not: he hath one that judgeth him, the Word that I have spoken, that shall judge him in the last day, (<a href="3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>).<p>And that he who does not believe in the Lord, is condemned, also in John:<p>He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life, and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the anger of God abideth on him, (<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 874 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>874. (Vers. 15.) "Et si quis non inventus est in Libro vitae scriptus, conjectus est in stagnum ignis," significat quod qui non vixerunt secundum praecepta Domini in Verbo, et non crediderunt in Dominum, condemnati sint. - Quod per "Librum vitae" significetur Verbum, et per "judicari ex illo libro" significetur secundum vera Verbi, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_874/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256" target=_top>256</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_874/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_259" target=_top>259</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_874/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_295" target=_top>295</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_874/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_303" target=_top>303</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_874/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_309" target=_top>309</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_874/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_317" target=_top>317</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_874/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_324" target=_top>324</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_874/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_330" target=_top>330</a>); <sup>1</sup>et non alius invenitur scriptus in Libro vitae, quam qui vixit secundum praecepta Domini in Verbo, et credidit in Dominum; ideo hoc intelligitur. Quod qui non vivit secundum praecepta Domini in Verbo condemnetur, docet Dominus apud Johannem: <p>"Si quis Mea audiverit verba, non tamen crediderit, Ego non judico illum; habet quod judicet eum, Verbum quod locutus sum, illud judicabit eum extremo die," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_874/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_47-48" target=_top>12:47-48</a>).<p>Et quod qui non credit in Dominum condemnetur, etiam apud Johannem: "Qui credit in Filium habet vitam aeternam; qui vero non credit Filio, non videbit vitam, sed ira Dei manet super eo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_874/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_3_36" target=_top>3:36</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;303 pro "302" </p>
