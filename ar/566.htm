<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>566.对此，我补充以下记事：</p><p>一场争论在灵人当中出现，即：若不通过主，人能否明白圣言中神学教义的任何真理。他们在这一点上达成共识：若不通过主，没有人能做到，因为：</p><p>若不是从天上赐的，人就不能得什么。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.27.htm">3:27</a>）</p><p>因此，他们争论的是，人若不直接靠近主，能否明白这类真理。一方声称，当直接靠近主，因为祂就是圣言；而另一方声称，直接靠近父神也能明白教义的真理。于是，这场争论主要针对这一点：基督徒可否直接靠近父神，从而越过主；这样做是不是一种胆大妄为、傲慢无礼之举。因为主说：</p><p>若不藉着我，没有人能到父那里去。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>）</p><p>但他们却把这一点搁置起来，声称，人能凭自己的光看到圣言中的教义真理。然而，这一点被否决了。所以，他们坚持认为那些向父神祷告的人能看到。于是，圣言中的一些话被读给他们，然后他们跪下求父神启示他们，并对于从圣言读给他们的这些话，声称如此如此是真理，其实都是虚假。这样的实验重复了数次，直到他们厌倦，最后坦承他们无法看到真理。而另一方面，那些直接靠近主的人看到了真理，并告诉了他们。</p><p>这场争论如此结束之后，一些灵人从深渊上来，初看似蝗虫，后看似人。他们就是那些在世时向父神祷告，并确认唯信称义的人。他们说，他们在清晰的光中从圣言看到：人唯独凭信称义，无需律法行为。他们被问及：“是什么样的信？”他们回答：“对父神的信。”然而，他们接受检查后，却从天上被告知，他们没有从圣言认识一个真理。但他们反驳说，他们仍在光中看见这真理。于是，他们被告知，他们是在昏昧之光中看到它。他们问：“什么是昏昧之光？”被告知，昏昧之光就是确认虚假之光，这光与猫头鹰、蝙蝠所在的光相对应。对它们来说，暗是光，光是暗。这一点通过以下事实来证明：他们仰望天堂，就是真光所在之地时，只看到黑暗；而俯视他们所来的深渊时，却看到光明。</p><p>这个证明惹恼了他们，他们说，光和暗什么也不是，不过是眼睛的一种状态，人据此声称光是光，暗是暗。然而，这表明他们所拥有的光是昏昧之光，就是确认虚假之光，并且他们的光只不过是其心智源于欲望之火的一种活动，与猫所享有的光没什么两样。在夜间的地下室，猫眼因燃烧着对老鼠的食欲而看似蜡烛。听到这些话，他们怒不可遏地说，他们不是猫，也不像猫，因为他们若愿意就能看见。不过，由于害怕被问到为何不愿看，他们就离开了，沉到他们自己的深渊和自己的光里去了。那里的人和像他们那样的人也被称为猫头鹰和蝙蝠。</p><p>他们在深渊遇见自己的同伴，便讲述天使说：“我们不知道任何教义真理，一个也不知道”，还称我们是蝙蝠和猫头鹰，结果引起骚乱。他们说：“我们向主祷告让我们上去，并给出清晰的证明：我们拥有许多教义真理，连天使长也承认它们。”他们向主祷告，这个恩惠便被赐予了，于是便有三百人上来。一出现在地上，他们就说：“在世时，我们就举世闻名，因为我们知道并教导唯信称义的奥秘，凭着确认，我们不仅看见光，还看到它如同闪耀的光芒，甚至现在我们就能在我们的房间里看到它。然而，我们从曾与你们在一起的同伴那里听说，这光不是光，而是黑暗，因为如你们所说，我们没有出于圣言的任何教义真理。我们知道，圣言的每个真理都会发光，也相信当我们深思我们的奥秘时，我们的光辉便由此产生。因此，我们会证明，我们从圣言拥有大量真理。”于是，他们说：“有一个三位一体，父神、子神和圣灵神，当信这三位一体，这个真理我们没有吗？基督是我们的救世主和救主，这个真理我们没有吗？唯独基督是公义的，唯独祂有功德，凡想把祂的功与义归给自己的人都是不义和不敬的，这个真理我们没有吗？没有哪个凡人能凭自己行出任何属灵的良善，本身为良善的一切良善皆来自神，这个真理我们没有吗？邀功之善和伪善是有的，这类善其实是恶，这个真理我们没有吗？靠自己力量的人丝毫无助于救恩，这个真理我们没有吗？但仍要行出仁爱的行为，这个真理我们没有吗？信是存在的，人当相信，并且每个人都要有符合自己信仰的生活，这个真理我们没有吗？此外还有出于圣言的许多其它事。你们有谁能否认其中一个？然而，你们却声称我们在辩论中没有任何真理，一个也没有。你们这样指责我们岂不有失公正？”</p><p>但他们得到的答复是：“你们所提出的这一切本身都是真理，但你们却将它们用来确认虚假原则，从而歪曲了它们，因此它们在你们当中和你们里面都是被歪曲的真理，因而是虚假，因为它们源于一个虚假原则。我们会就这一事实给你们一个直观的证明。离此不远处有一个地方，光从天上直接流入其中。这地方中间还有一张桌子。当写有圣言真理的纸张放在这张桌子上时，这纸便因上面所写的真理而闪耀如星辰。所以，将你们的真理写在一张纸上，放在桌子上，你们就会看到。”他们照做了，并把纸交给守卫。守卫把它放在桌子上，对他们说：“退后一点，看这张桌子。”他们退后观察，看哪，这张纸闪耀如星辰。然后守卫说：“你们看，你们写在纸上的都是真理。不过，请就近注视这张纸。”他们照做了，突然这光消失了，纸也变黑了，仿佛蒙上一层炉灰。守卫继续说：“用手摸这张纸，小心别碰到字迹。”他们一摸，一团火焰便迸发出来，将纸烧成灰烬。看到这一幕，他们赶紧逃开，被告知：“你们要是碰了字迹，就会听到爆炸声，你们的手指也会烧伤。”于是，站在后面的一些人说：“你们现在看见了，你们为证明你们称义奥秘所滥用的真理本身是真理，但在你们里面，它们却成了歪曲的真理。”然后，他们抬头仰望，天向他们显如血，后来又像黑暗。在天使灵的眼里，他们自己有的像蝙蝠，有的像猫头鹰，有的像鼹鼠，有的像角鸮，他们逃到自己的黑暗中，在他们眼里，这黑暗闪烁着昏昧之光。</p><p>在场的天使灵都很震惊，因为他们以前根本不知道还有这么一个地方，并且这个地方有这么一张桌子。这时，有声音从南部地区传来说：“到这边来，你们会看到更神奇的事。”于是，他们过去进入一个房间，房间的墙壁像金子一样闪闪发光。在那里，他们也看见一张桌子，上面摆着一本圣言，被天堂样式的宝石所环绕。守卫天使说：“当圣言被打开时，就有无法形容的白光闪耀出来；这时，一道彩虹因这些宝石而显现在圣言上面及周围。当三层天的天使走近并观看这本打开的圣言时，圣言上面及周围五彩斑斓的彩虹就显现在红色背景上；当二层天的天使来观看时，那彩虹就显现在蓝色背景上；当最低层天的天使来观看时，那彩虹就显现在白色背景上；而当善灵来观看时，光就有了杂色，如同大理石。”这些效果还直观地展示给他们。守卫天使进一步说：“当有歪曲圣言的人靠近时，首先，光芒会消失；若他靠近注视圣言，圣言仿佛被血包围。于是，他便被警告离开，因为这很危险。”</p><p>有一个灵人在世时是唯信教义的主讲老师，他大胆上前说：“我在世时没有歪曲过圣言。高举信的同时，我也高举仁，并教导，人在信的状态下实践仁爱及其行为，才能被更新、重生和圣化。我还教导，信若独自存在，即离开好行为，犹如不结果的树，不发光的太阳，没有热的火。我还批评那些声称好行为没有必要的人。此外，我十分重视十诫和悔改，从而以奇妙的方式将圣言中的一切运用到有关信的条款中；不过，我还是发现并证明，唯信得救。”他自信满满地声称自己没有歪曲过圣言，走到桌子跟前，不顾天使的警告触摸圣言。突然，有火和烟从圣言冒出来，并且发生了爆炸，伴随着巨大的撞击，结果他被震到房间的一个角落里，像死人一样躺在那里好一会。天使灵对此感到震惊，但他们被告知，尽管比起其他人，这位领袖更推崇从信所发出的仁之良善，但他依然将其理解为政治行为，也就是所谓的道德文明，实践这些行为是为了这个世界和个人的成功，而不是将其理解为了神和救赎所做的任何行为。他还将这人丝毫不知的圣灵无形之工包括在内；在信的状态下，这些无形之工被植入在信的行为中。</p><p>然后，天使灵讨论了对圣言的歪曲，他们在讨论的过程达成共识：歪曲圣言就是从圣言提取真理，用来确认虚假。这等于把它们从圣言拖出来并杀之；如从圣言取出这一真理：当爱我们的邻舍，当出于爱为了神和永生而向他行善的人。若这时有人确认这一点，认为当做这些事，但不是为了得救，因为人所行的一切善都不是善，那么，他就在将这真理从圣言拖出来，并毁灭它；因为主在祂的圣言中吩咐凡想要得救的人要貌似凭自己向他的邻舍行善，然而也要相信这是靠着主。</p><h4

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 566</h4><p>566. To this I will append the following accounts:<p>An argument arose among some spirits as to whether it is possible for someone to see a doctrinal, theological truth in the Word without doing so from the Lord. They all agreed that no one could without doing so from God, because "a person can obtain nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven" (<a href="3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>). Thus they were arguing over whether anyone could do so without directly approaching the Lord. Spirits on one side said that the Lord must be approached directly because He embodies the Word. Spirits on the other side said that doctrinal truth may be seen when one approaches God the Father directly. The argument therefore came down to this primarily, whether any Christian might approach God the Father directly and so climb up above the Lord, or whether this would be an improper and reckless act of arrogance and audacity, because the Lord says that no one comes to the Father except through Him (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p>They left this point, however, and said that a person could see doctrinal truth in the Word by the use of his own natural sight. But this point, too, was rejected. Therefore they insisted that those people could see it who pray to God the Father. Something from the Word was accordingly read to them, and then kneeling they prayed for God the Father to enlighten them. And in response to the words read to them from the Word, they said that such and such was the truth in them, though what they said was false. This experiment was repeated several times until they tired of it. Finally they confessed that it was not possible. Meanwhile the spirits on the other side, who approached the Lord directly, kept seeing the truths and informing them of them.</p><p>[2] After this argument thus came to an end, some spirits rose up from a pit who looked at first like locusts, but afterward as human. They were people who in the world had prayed to the Father and convinced themselves of justification by faith alone. They said that they saw with a clear sight and also from the Word that a person is justified by faith alone apart from works of the Law. They were asked what faith that was. They replied, "Faith in God the Father." But after they had been examined, they were told from heaven that they did not know even one doctrinal truth from the Word. At that they retorted that still they saw it clearly. They were then told that they saw it in an illusory light.<p>"What is an illusory light?" they asked.<p>They were informed that an illusory light is the light of a defense of falsity, and that that light corresponded to the kind of light had by owls and bats, for which darkness is light, and light darkness. They had this confirmed for them by the fact that when they looked upward to heaven, where real light is found, they saw darkness, and when they looked downward into the pit from where they had come, they saw light.</p><p>[3] Incensed at this confirmation, the spirits said that light and dark are therefore not something real, but are only conditions of the eye that cause people to say that light is light and that dark is dark.<p>They were shown, however, that theirs was an illusory light, namely, the light of a defense of falsity, and that their light was only an activity of their minds arising from the fire of their lusts, not unlike the light of cats, whose eyes in storerooms at night look like candles because of their burning appetite for rats and mice.<p>Hearing this, the spirits angrily said that they were not cats, or even like cats, because they could see if they wished. But because they were afraid to be asked why they did not wish to, they left and descended into their pit and into their own light.<p>The inhabitants there and others like them are also called owls and bats.</p><p>[4] When those spirits reached their fellows in the pit and told them that angels had said that they did not know any doctrinal truth, not even one, and that they had therefore called them bats and owls, a tumult arose there. And their fellows said, "We will pray to the Lord to be allowed to ascend, and we will clearly show that we have many doctrinal truths, which even archangels will acknowledge."<p>Then, because they prayed to the Lord, they were given permission, and as many as three hundred of them ascended. And on emerging above ground they said, "In the world we were celebrated and renowned, because we knew and taught the mysteries of justification by faith alone, and from our proofs we gained not only a clear sight, but also as it were brilliant flashes of light, as we continue to do currently in our chambers. And yet we have been told by our comrades who were in your company that this light is not light but darkness, because, as you said, we do not have any doctrinal truth from the Word.<p>"We know that every one of the Word's truths shines, and we have believed that our flashes of light come from them when we are deeply pondering our mysteries. We will show, therefore that we possess a great abundance of truths from the Word."<p>So they said, "Have we not this truth, that there is a Trinity of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, and that people must believe in the Trinity?<p>"Have we not this truth, that Christ is our Redeemer and Savior?<p>"Have we not this truth, that Christ alone is righteousness, and that He alone possess merit, and that any person who wishes to ascribe any of His merit and righteousness to himself is unrighteous and impious?<p>"Have we not this truth, that no mortal can do any spiritual good of himself, but that all good that is good in itself comes from God?<p>"Have we not this truth, that there is such a thing as merit-seeking good and also hypocritical good, and that these goods are evil?<p>"Have we not this truth, that no one can, by his own power, contribute anything to his salvation?<p>"Have we not this truth, that works of charity must still be done?<p>"Have we not this truth, that there is such a thing as faith, that people must believe, and that everyone has life in the measure of his belief? And so, too, many other truths from the Word.<p>"Who of you can deny any of these truths? And yet you have said that in our deliberations we do not have any truth, not even one. Have you not cast such accusations at us undeservedly?"</p><p>[5] But they were told in reply then, "Everything that you have cited is, in itself, true, but you have falsified those truths by using them to support a false principle, and therefore with you and in you they are truths falsified - truths which derive from the false principle the character of being themselves false.<p>"We will also demonstrate the reality of this visibly. Not far from here there is a place where light flows in directly from heaven. At the center of it is a table. When a piece of paper is placed on it on which a truth from the Word has been written, the piece of paper shines like a star because of the truth written on it. Write, therefore, your truths on a piece of paper and have it placed on the table, and you will see."<p>They did so and gave the piece of paper to a guard, who placed it on the table and said to them, "Move back and keep your eyes on the table."<p>So they moved back and watched, and lo, the piece of paper shone like a star.<p>Then the guard said, "You see that the things you wrote on the piece of paper are true. But come nearer and fix your gaze on the piece of paper."<p>They did so, and suddenly then the light disappeared and the piece of paper turned black, as though covered with the soot of a furnace.<p>And speaking again the guard said, "Touch the paper with your hands, but be careful not to touch the writing."<p>And when they did as bidden, a flame erupted and consumed the paper.<p>On seeing this the spirits fled away. And they were told, "If you had touched the writing, you would have heard a sharp report and burned your fingers."<p>Some bystanders then told them from behind, "You have seen now that the truths you abused to support the mysteries of your idea of justification are true in themselves, but in you are truths falsified.<p>The spirits then looked up, and the sky appeared to them as though blood-red, and after that as black. Moreover, they themselves appeared to the eyes of angelic spirits, some as bats, some as barn owls, some as moles, and some as eagle owls. And they fled away into their darkness, which to their eyes shone with an illusory light.</p><p>[6] The angelic spirits who were present were astonished, because they had not known anything about that place and table before. And then a voice spoke to them from the southern zone, saying, "Come over here, and you will see something even more marvelous."<p>So they went, and entered into a room whose walls shone as though with gold, and they saw a table there also, on which lay a copy of the Word, surrounded with precious stones in a heavenly pattern.<p>An angelic guard then said, "When the Word is opened, a beam of light radiates from it, of indescribable brilliance, and at the same time then a rainbow emanating from the precious stones appears above and around the Word. When an angel from the third heaven comes here and views the open Word, a multicolored rainbow appears above and around the Word against a red background. When an angel from the second heaven comes here and views it, the rainbow appears against a blue background. When an angel from the lowest heaven comes and views it, the rainbow appears against a white background. And when a good spirit comes and views it, a variegated light appears as though of marble."<p>The reality of this was also visibly shown to them.<p>The angelic guard said further, "If someone comes here who has falsified the Word, then first the radiance vanishes, and if he draws near and fixes his eyes on the Word, it becomes surrounded as though by blood, and he is warned to leave because he is in danger."</p><p>[7] One of the spirits, however, who in the world had been a leading authority on the doctrine of faith alone, boldly came forward and said, "When I was in the world I did not falsify the Word. Along with faith I also extolled charity, and I taught that a person is renewed, regenerated and sanctified in a state of faith in which he practices charity and its works. I said, too, that faith is not possible by itself, that is, without good works, as a tree is not possible without its fruit, the sun without its light, or fire without its warmth. Moreover, I also faulted those who said that good works are not necessary, and I stressed as well the importance of the Ten Commandments and also repentance. Thus in a marvelous way I applied everything in the Word to our article on faith, which I even so determined and showed to be alone saving."<p>Trusting in his assertion that he had not falsified the Word, the spirit went over to the table, and despite the angel's warning, touched the Word. And suddenly then fire and smoke poured from the Word, and there was an explosion and loud crash, which hurled the spirit to a corner of the room, and he lay there for a time as though dead.<p>The angelic spirits were surprised at this, but they were told that although that notable more than others had extolled the goods of charity as emanating from faith, still he meant only public works called moral and civic, which have to be done for the sake of the world and success in it, but not any of the works that must be done for God's sake and for the sake of salvation. Moreover they were told that he also substituted for those works the invisible works of the Holy Spirit of which a person is not at all aware, which are engendered in the act of faith in a state of faith.</p><p>[8] The angelic spirits then talked together about falsification of the Word, and they agreed that to falsify the Word is to take truths from it and use them to support falsities, which is to take them out of the Word and away from it and slay them. As for example, if someone takes this truth from the Word, that the neighbor is to be loved, and that good must be done to him out of a love for him for God's sake and for the sake of eternal life, and if he then establishes that it must be done, but not for the sake of salvation, because every good done by man is not good, then he takes that truth out of the Word and away from it and butchers it. For the Lord in His Word enjoins on everyone who wishes to be saved to do good to the neighbor as though of himself, and yet to believe that it comes from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 566</h4><p>566. To these things I will add these MEMORABLE OCCURRENCES. A dispute arose among spirits as to whether anyone can see any theological doctrinal truth in the Word except from the Lord. They all agreed in this, that no man can except from the Lord, because 'A man cannot lay hold of anything, unless it be given him out of heaven' (<a href="3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>). For which reason they were disputing whether anyone can [see such truths] unless he approaches the Lord directly. On the one hand it was said that the Lord ought to be approached directly because He is the Word, on the other that doctrinal truth is also seen when God the Father is approached directly. The dispute therefore turned on this as the main point, whether it is permissible for any Christian to approach God the Father directly, and thus climb up above the Lord, and whether this would not be an improper and ill-advised insolence and audacity, because the Lord says that 'No one comes to the Father but through Him' (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>). But they left this and said that a man can see doctrinal truth in the Word from his own light. This, however, was rejected. Therefore they insisted that it can be seen by those who pray to God the Father. Something was therefore read to them out of the Word, whereupon they were praying on their knees that God the Father would enlighten them, and saying with reference to the words read to them out of the Word that such and such was the truth there. But it was untrue. This was repeated several times till they got tired. At length they confessed that they were unable [to see the truth]. On the other hand, however, those who approached the Lord directly were seeing truths and informing them.</p><p>[2] After the dispute had been thus broken off some [spirits] came up out of the deep, appearing first as locusts but later on as men. They were those who in the world prayed to the Father and confirmed with themselves justification by faith alone, and they were saying that they saw in a clear light, and also out of the Word, that man is justified by faith alone without the works of the law. Asked, 'By what faith?' they answered, 'In God the Father.' However, after they were examined it was said to them out of heaven that they did not know even one doctrinal truth out of the Word. But they retorted that still they saw this in the light, whereupon it was said to them that they saw it in a fatuous light. Having asked 'What is fatuous light?,' they were informed that fatuous light is the light of the confirmation of untruths, and that that light corresponds to the light in which owls and bats are, to which darkness is light and light darkness. This was being confirmed by the fact that when they were hooking upwards to heaven, where the light itself is, they were seeing darkness, and when they were looking downwards to the deep whence they were, they were seeing light.</p><p>[3] Annoyed at this confirmation they said that thus light and darkness were not anything, but only states of the eye by virtue of which it is said that light is light and that darkness is darkness. It was, however, shown to them that the fatuous light which is the light of the confirmation of untruth was what they had, and that their light was only an activity of their mind originating out of the fire of lusts, not unlike the light of cats, whose eyes appear like candles in the night-the owing to a burning appetite for mice in cellars. Enraged on hearing these things they said that they were not cats, nor like cats, because they could see if they were willing; but because they were afraid of being asked why they were not willing they retreated and sank down into their own deep and their own light. Those who are there, and those who are like them, are also called owls and bats.</p><p>[4] When they came to their companions in the deep and related that the angels said that 'we do not know any doctrinal truth, not even one,' and that 'they therefore called us bats and owls,' it caused a riot. And they were saying, 'Let us pray to the Lord to let us go up and give a clear demonstration that we have many doctrinal truths, which the very archangels will acknowledge.' And because they were praying to the Lord the favour was granted, and as many as three hundred came up. And when they were seen above ground they said, 'In the world we were celebrated and famous because we knew and taught the arcana of justification by faith alone, and by virtue of confirmations we not only saw the light but also saw it as a gleaming radiance, even as we do now in our rooms. Yet we have heard from our companions who have been with you that that light was not light but darkness, because of our not having, as you have said, any doctrinal truth out of the Word. We know that every truths of the Word shines, and we believe that our brilliance results from this while we have been meditating deeply upon our arcana. We shall therefore demonstrate that we do have truths out of the Word in great abundance.' And they said, 'Do we not have this truth, that there is a Trinity, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, and that there should be belief in the Trinity? Do we not have this truth, that Christ is our Redeemer and Saviour? Do we not have this truth, that Christ Only is Justice and that He Only is Merit, and that he who is willing to ascribe any of His merit and justice to himself is unjust and wicked? Do we not have this truth, that no mortal can do any spiritual good from himself, but that every good that is good in itself is from God? Do we not have this truth, that there is merit-seeking and also hypocritical good, and that these goods are evil? Do we not have this truth, that a man of his own strength can contribute nothing at all to his salvation? Do we not have this truth, that still the works of charity should be done? Do we not have this truth, that there is faith, and that one should believe, and that everyone has a life as he believes? Besides many other things out of the Word? Which of you can deny any of these things? And yet you Have said that we do not have any truth in our schools, not even one. Have you not been wrong in making such charges against us?'</p><p>[5] But then they made the answer, 'All the things that you have advanced are in themselves truths, but you have falsified them by applying them to confirm a false principle, and consequently with you and in you they are truths falsified, and they derive the fact of being untrue from the false principle. We shall also make an ocular demonstration of this fact. Thieve is a place not far from here into which the light flows directly out of heaven. There in the midst is a table upon which, when any piece of paper is placed with a truth out of the Word written on it, that paper, by virtue of the truth written on it, shines like a star. Write your truths, therefore, on a piece of paper and put it on the table, and you will see. They did so, and gave it to the guardian who put it on the table. He then said to them, 'Move away and look at the table.' And they moved away and were looking, and lo! the paper was shining like a star. Then the guardian said, 'You see that they are truths that you have written on the paper. But draw nearer and fix your gaze on the paper.' And they did so, and then suddenly the light vanished and the paper became black as if covered with the soot of a furnace. And the keeper said further, 'Touch the paper with your hands, but be careful not to touch the writing.' And when they did so a flame burst forth and consumed it. Having seen these things, they fled away; and it was said to them, 'If you had touched the writings you would have heard a report and burnt your fingers.' Whereupon it was said by some standing behind, 'You have now seen that the truths that you have abused for confirming the arcana of your justification are in themselves truths, but in you they are truths falsified.' They then looked upwards, and the heaven appeared to them like blood, and afterwards like thick-darkness. And they themselves were seen in the sight of angelic spirits, some like bats, some like owls, some like moles and some like horned owls, and they fled away into their own darkness, which in their sight was fatuously shining.</p><p>[6] The angelic spirits who were present were astonished because previously they knew nothing of that place and the table there. And a voice then came to them from the southern quarter saying, 'Come this way, and you will see something still more wonderful.' And they approached and entered a room the walls of which were shining as of gold, and they saw there also a table upon which lay the Word bound up with precious stones in a heavenly form. And the guardian angel said, 'When the Word is opened a light of ineffable whiteness shines forth, and then by reason of the precious stones a rainbow appears above and around the Word. Whenever any angel out of the third heaven comes thither and looks at the opened Word the many-coloured rainbow above and around the Word appears on a red ground. When an angel out of the second heaven comes thither and looks the rainbow appears on an azure ground. When an angel out of the ultimate heaven comes and looks the rainbow appears on a white ground. When any good spirit comes and looks the variegation of the light appears like marble.' That it is so was also shown visibly to them. The guardian angel said further, 'If one approaches who has falsified the Word the brightness first vanishes, and if he approaches and fixes his gaze on the Word it becomes as if surrounded with blood, and he is then warned to depart because it is dangerous.'</p><p>[7] But a certain one, who in the world had been a leading teacher of the doctrine of faith alone, approached boldly and said, 'When I was in the world I did not falsify the Word. I exalted charity also together with faith, and taught that man, in the state of faith in which he does charity and its works, is renewed, regenerated and sanctified; also that the faith then is not given on its own, that is, without good works, just as there is no tree without fruit, sun without light, or fire without heat. And I have also blamed those who said that good works were not necessary. Moreover I have laid great stress on the precepts of the Decalogue, and also on repentance. And thus in a wonderful manner I have applied all things of the Word to the article on faith, which I have discovered and demonstrated to be still alone saving.' In the confidence of his assertion that he did not falsify the Word, he approached the table, and contrary to the warning of the angel touched the Word. But then suddenly fire with smoke issued out of the Word and an explosion took place with a tremendous crash, with the result that he was thrown Into a corner of the room and lay there for a while as if dead. The angelic spirits were amazed at this, but they were told that that leader (praesul) had more than others exalted the goods of charity as proceeding from faith, but still he had not understood other than the political works, which are also called moral and civil, that are to be done for the sake of the world and prosperity there, but not any works that are to be done for the sake of God and salvation; also that he had substituted invisible works by the Holy Spirit, of which the man knows nothing, which are innate in the act of faith in the state thereof.</p><p>[8] The angelic spirits then had a discussion about the falsification of the Word, in the course of which they agreed that to falsify the Word is to select truths out of the Word and apply them for confirming untruths. This is to draw them out of the Word outside it, and kill them; as, for example, he who selects therefrom this truths, that the neighbour is to be loved, and that good is to be done to him out of love for the sake of God and eternal life. If one then confirms this as obligatory, but not for the sake of salvation, because every good from man is not good, he draws that truth out of the Word outside the Word and slaughters it; for the Lord in His Word enjoins on every man who wishes to be saved, to do good to the neighbour as if from himself, and yet to believe that it is from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 566</h4><p>566. To these things I will add this Relation. There arose a strife among some spirits, whether anyone can see any doctrinal theological truth in the Word, except from the Lord. They all agreed in this, that no one can, except from God, because:<p>No man can receive anything except it be given him from heaven, (<a href="3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>).<p>For which reason the dispute was, whether it is possible to anyone unless he goes immediately to the Lord. They said on the one hand, that the Lord is to be approached directly, because He is the Word; and on the other, that doctrinal truth may also be seen when God the Father is immediately approached. On which account the dispute centered upon this point, Whether it is lawful for any Christian to go immediately to God the Father, and so to climb above the Lord; and whether this is not insolence and audacity both indecent and rash; because the Lord says that:<p>No one cometh to the Father but through Him, (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p>But they left this, and said that a man can see a doctrinal truth in the Word from his own natural light [lumen]; but this was rejected. Wherefore they insisted that it might be seen by those who pray to God the Father. Therefore something was read to them from the Word; and then they prayed upon their knees, that God the Father would enlighten them; and as to the words which were read before them from the Word, they said that this and that was the truth therein; but it was false; and this repeatedly even to tediousness. At length they confessed that it was not possible. But on the other side, they who went immediately to the Lord, saw truths, and informed the others.</p><p>[2] After this dispute was thus finished, there came up some out of the abyss, who appeared at first like locusts, but afterwards as men. They were those who in the world prayed to the Father, and confirmed themselves in justification by faith alone; and they said that they saw the tenet that man is justified by faith alone without the works of the law, in clear light, and also from the Word. They were asked, "By what faith?" They answered, "In God the Father." But after they were examined, it was said to them from heaven, that they did not know even one doctrinal truth from the Word. But they replied that still they saw this in the light. It was then said to them that they saw it in fatuous light. They asked, "What is fatuous light?" They were informed that fatuous light is the light of the confirmation of falsity; and that this light corresponds to the light in which owls and bats are, to which darkness is light, and light is darkness. This was confirmed by the fact, that when they looked upwards to heaven, where light itself is, they saw darkness; but when they looked downwards to the abyss whence they were, they saw light.</p><p>[3] Being indignant at this confirmation, they said that "thus light and darkness are not anything, but only a state of the eye, from which light is called light, and darkness, darkness." But it was shown that their light was fatuous light, which is the light of the confirmation of falsity; and that it was only the activity of their minds arising from the fire of lusts, not unlike the light of cats, whose eyes, owing to their burning appetite for mice in cellars in the nighttime, appear like candles. On hearing these things, being angry, they said that they were not cats, nor like cats; because they could see, if they would. But because they feared being asked why they would not, they retired, and let themselves down into their abyss and into their light. They who are there, and those who are like them, are also called owls and bats.</p><p>[4] When they came to their companions in the abyss, and related that "the angels said that we do not know any doctrinal truths, not even one;" and that "they therefore called us bats and owls," there was a great tumult. And they said, "Let us pray to the Lord for permission to ascend, and we will show clearly that we have many doctrinal truths, which the archangels themselves will acknowledge." And because they prayed to the Lord, leave was given, and they ascended to the number of three hundred. And when they appeared above the earth, they said, "We were celebrated and famed in the world, because we knew and taught the arcana of justification by faith alone; and from confirmations we not only saw the light, but also as it were a flashing radiance; as we still do in our cells. And yet we have heard from our companions who were with you, that this light is not light, but darkness; for the reason that we have not, as you said, any doctrinal truth from the Word. We know that every truth of the Word shines; and we believe that our radiance is thence, when we profoundly meditate upon our arcana. We will, therefore, demonstrate that we have truths from the Word in great abundance." And they said, "Have we not this truth, that there is a Trinity, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit; and that the Trinity must be believed in? Have we not this truth, that Christ is our Redeemer and Savior? Have we not this truth, that Christ alone is justice, and that He alone has merit? and that he is unjust and impious, who wishes to ascribe to himself anything of His justice and merit? Have we not this truth, that no mortal can do any spiritual good of himself, but that all good which is good in itself is from God? Have we not this truth, that there is given meritorious and also hypocritical good, and that these goods are evil? Have we not this truth, that man of his own powers can contribute nothing to his salvation? Have we not this truth, that the works of charity are still to be done? Have we not this truth, that there is faith, and that one must believe, and that everyone has life according to his belief? Besides many other things from the Word? Who of you can deny anyone of these? And yet you said that we have not any truth in our schools, not even one. Have you not asserted such things against us through prejudice?"</p><p>[5] But they then received the answer, "All the things which you have advanced are in themselves truths; but you have falsified them, by applying them to confirm a false principle; and hence with you and in you they are falsified truths, which are false by being derived from a false principle. That it is so, we will demonstrate even to the sight. Not far from here is a place into which light flows immediately from heaven. In the midst of it there is a table. When any paper on which a truth from the Word is written is placed upon it, that paper, from the truth written on it, shines like a star. Write your truths, therefore, on a paper, and let it be put upon that table; and you will see." They did so, and gave it to the keeper, who put it upon the table; who then said to them, "Withdraw a little and look at the table." And they withdrew and looked; and behold, the paper shone like a star. And then the keeper said, "You see that the things which you have written upon the paper are truths. But come nearer, and look intently at the paper!" And they did so; and then the light suddenly disappeared, and the paper became black, as if covered with the soot of a furnace. And the keeper said further, "Touch the paper with your hands, but be careful not to touch the writing." And when they did so, a flame burst forth, and consumed it. Seeing this, they fled away; and it was said to them, "If you had touched the writing, you would have heard an explosion, and would have burned your fingers." And it was then said by them that stood behind, "You have now seen that the truths which you have abused to confirm the arcana of your justification, are truths in themselves; but that in you they are truths falsified." They then looked up, and heaven appeared to them as blood, and afterwards as thick darkness; and they seemed before the eyes of angelic spirits, some like bats, some like owls, some like moles, and some like horned owls; and they fled away into their darkness, which to their eyes shone fatuously.</p><p>[6] The angelic spirits who were present wondered that they had not before known anything of that place, and of the table there. And a voice then came to them from the southern quarter, saying, "Come hither, and you will see something still more wonderful." And they came, and entered into a chamber, the walls of which shone as if from gold; and they saw there also a table, upon which lay the Word, set around with precious stones in heavenly forms. And the angel keeper said, "When the Word is opened, a light beams forth thence of ineffable brightness; and at the same time there appears from the precious stones a rainbow above and around the Word. When any angel from the third heaven comes thither, and looks at the open Word, there appears above and around the Word a rainbow of various colors on a red ground. When an angel comes thither from the second heaven, and looks, there appears a rainbow on a blue ground. When an angel from the lowest heaven comes and looks, there appears a rainbow on a white ground. When any good spirit comes and looks, there appears a variegation of light, as of marble." That it was so, was also shown them visibly. The angel keeper further said, "If anyone approaches, who has falsified the Word, the splendor is then first dissipated; and if he approaches, and fixes his eyes on the Word, there is an appearance of blood around; and he is then admonished to depart, because there is danger."</p><p>[7] But a certain one, who in the world had been a prominent author on the doctrine of faith alone, boldly approached, and said, "When I was in the world, I did not falsify the Word; I also exalted charity together with faith; and I taught that man in the state of faith, in which he does charity and its works, is renewed, regenerated, and sanctified; and also that faith is then not solitary, that is, without good works; as a tree is not without fruit, the sun without light, and fire without heat; and I also blamed those who said that good works were not necessary, and moreover I magnified the precepts of the Decalogue, and also repentance; and I thus applied all things of the Word in a wonderful manner to the article of faith, which I set forth and demonstrated to be still alone saving." In the confidence of his assertion that he had not falsified the Word, he came up to the table, and, contrary to the warning of the angel, touched the Word. But then suddenly fire with smoke issued from the Word, and an explosion took place with a great crash, by which he was thrown to a corner of the chamber, and lay there as dead for half an hour. This the angelic spirits wondered at; but it was said to them, that that prelate had exalted the goods of charity as proceeding from faith more than others; but that still he meant no other than political works, which are also called moral and civil, and which are to be done for the sake of the world and of prosperity therein; but not any works which are to be done for the sake of God and salvation: and also that he included the unseen works of the Holy Spirit, of which the man knows nothing; which are implanted in the act of faith during its state.</p><p>[8] The angelic spirits then conversed among themselves concerning the falsification of the Word: and they agreed upon this, that to falsify the Word is to take truths from it, and apply them to confirm falsities; which is to drag them forth from the Word outside of it, and slay them. As for example: he who takes therefrom this truth, that the neighbor is to be loved, and that good is to be done to him from love for the sake of God and eternal life; if anyone then confirms this, that it is to be done, but not for the sake of salvation, because all good from man is not good, he drags that truth from the Word outside of the Word, and destroys it; since the Lord in His Word enjoins it upon every man who wishes to be saved, to do good to his neighbor as of himself, and yet to believe that it is of the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 566 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>566. His adjiciam haec MEMORABILIA Exorta est lis inter Spiritus, Num quisquam possit videre aliquod Verum doctrinale theologicum in Verbo, nisi a Domino. In eo convenerunt omnes, quod nemo possit nisi a Deo, quia "Non potest homo sumere quicquam nisi sit datum illi e Caelo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_566/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_3_27" target=_top>Johannes 3:27</a>) <p>quapropter litebatur, num aliquis possit, nisi adeat immediate Dominum. <p>Dixerunt ab una parte quod Dominus directe adeundus sit quia est Verbum. <p>Ab altera parte quod etiam videatur verum doctrinale cum Deus Pater immediate aditur; quare declinabat lis in hoc primum, num alicui Christiano liceat Deum Patrem immediate adire, et sic scandere supra Dominum, et annon hoc sit insolentia et audacia indecens et temeraria, quia Dominus dicit, quod "Nemo veniat ad Patrem nisi per Ipsum, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_566/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_6" target=_top>Johannes 14:6</a>).<p>Sed hoc reliquerunt, et dixerunt quod homo possit videre verum doctrinale in Verbo a suomet lumine naturali, sed hoc rejectum est. Quare institerunt, quod videri possit ab illis qui ad Deum Patrem orant: quare lectum est coram illis aliquid ex Verbo, et tunc orabant super genubus, ut Deus Pater illustraret illos; et ad verba quae lecta coram illis ex Verbo, dicebant quod hoc et illud esset verum ibi, sed erat falsum. Ita aliquoties usque ad taedium; tandem fassi sunt quod non possint. <p>At ab altera parte, qui immediate adiverunt Dominum, videbant vera, et informabant illos. <p>Post hanc litem ita diremptam ascenderunt aliqui ex abysso, qui apparuerunt primum sicut locustae, sed postea sicut homines. Erant qui in mundo oraverunt ad Patrem, et justificationem per solam Fidem apud se confirmaverunt; et dicebant quod videant id, quod homo justificetur per solam Fidem absque Operibus Legis, in clara luce, et quoque ex Verbo. <p>Interrogati sunt, "Per quam fidem." Responderunt "In Deum Patrem." <p>Sed postquam explorati sunt, dictum est illis e Caelo, quod ne quidem unum verum doctrinale ex Verbo sciant. <p>At regesserunt, quod usque videant id in luce. <p>Tunc dictum est illis quod videant id in luce fatua. <p>Quaesiverunt, "Quid est lux fatua." <p>Informati sunt quod lux fatua sit lux confirmationis falsi, et quod illa lux correspondeat luci in qua sunt noctuae et vespertiliones, quibus tenebrae sunt lux, et lux sunt tenebrae. Hoc confirmabatur per id, quod cum spectabant sursum ad Caelum, et cum spectabant deorsum ad abyssum, unde erant, viderent lucem. <p>Ex hac confirmatione indignati dixerunt, quod "Sic lux et tenebrae non sint aliquid, sed modo status oculi, ex quo dicitur quod lux sit lux et quod tenebrae sint tenebrae." <p>At ostensum est, quod lux fat1a, quae est lux confirmationis falsi, illis esset; et quod lux eorum modo esset activitas mentis eorum oriunda ex igne concupiscentiarum, non absimilis luci felium, quorum oculi ex ardente appetitu glirium in cellariis nocturno tempore apparent sicut candelae. <p>His auditi, irati dixerunt, quod non sint feles, nec sicut feles, quia possunt videre si volunt. <p>Sed qua timebant interrogationem cur non volunt, recesserunt, et demiserunt se in abyssum suam et in lucem suam. Vocantur etiam qui ibi sunt, et qui similes illis, Noctuae et Vespertiliones. <p>Dum illi venerunt ad suos in abysso, et narraverunt quod "Angeli dixerint, quod nos non sciamus ullum verum doctrinale, ne quidem unum," et quod "ideo appellaverint nos Vespertiliones et Noctuas," factus ibi est tumultus. <p>Et dicebant, "Oremus ad Dominum, ut Liceat ascendere, et clare demonstrabimus quod nobis sint multa vera doctrinalia, quae ipsi Archangeli agnoscent." <p>Et quia orabant ad Dominum, data est venia; et ascenderunt usque ad trecentos. <p>Et visi supra terram dixerunt, "Nos fuimus in mundo celebres et famigerati, quia novimus et ubi ipsa lux, viderent tenebras, docuimus arcana justificationis per solam Fidem, et ex confirmationibus non modo vidimus lucem, sed etiam sicut jubar coruscans, et similiter nunc in nostris cellis; et tamen audivimus ex sociis nostris, qui apud vos fuerunt, quod lux illa non esset lux sed tenebrae, ex causa, quia non habemus, ut dixistis, ullum verum doctrinale ex Verbo. Scimus quod omne verum Verbi luceat, et credidimus, quod inde sit coruscatio nostra dum arcana nostra profunde meditati sumus. Quare demonstrabimus, quod vera ex Verbo nobis sint in multa copia." Et dixerunt, "Annon hoc verum nobis est, Quod Trinitas sit, Deus Pater. Deus Filius, et Deus Spiritus Sanctus, et quod in Trinitatem credendum sit. Annon hoc verum nobis est, Quod Christus sit noster Redemptor et Salvator. Annon hoc verum nobis est, Quod Christus Solus sit Justitia, et quod Ipsi Soli sit Meritum, et quod injustus et impius sit qui sibi aliquid meriti et justitiae Ipsius vult addicare. Annon hoc verum nobis est, Quod nemo mortalium aliquod donum spirituale possit facere a se ipso, sed quod omne donum quod in se bonum est, sit a Deo. Annon hoc verum nobis est, Quod detur bonum meritorium et quoque hypocriticum, et quod illa dona sint mala. Annon hoc verum nobis est, Quod homo ex propriis veribus ne hilum possit conferre ad suam salutem. Annon hoc verum nobis est, Quod usque opera charitatis facienda sint, Annon hoc verum nobis est, Quod fides sit, et quod credendum sit, et quod quisque <sup>1</sup>sicut credit, vitam habeat. Praeter plura alia ex Verbo. Quis vestrum potest negare aliquod ex illis; et tamen dixistis, quod nobis in nostris palaestris 'non sit aliquod verum, ne quidem unum.' Annon nobis ingratiis talia objecistis." <p>Sed tunc responsum tulerunt, "Omnia illa quae attulistis, in se sunt vera, sed vos falsificavistis illa, applicando illa ad confirmandum falsum principium; et inde sunt apud vos et in vobis vera falsificata, quae ex principio falso trahunt quod sint falsa. Quod ita sit etiam demonstrabimus ad oculum. Est non procul abhinc locus in quem lux e Caelo immediate influit; est in medio ibi mensa; dum super illa aliqua charta, cui Verum ex Verbo inscriptum est, ponitur, charta illa ex Vero inscripto lucet sicut stella. Inscribite ergo vestra vera chartae, et ponatur super illa mensa, et videbitis." <p>Fecerunt ita, et dederunt illam custodi, qui posuit illam super mensa; qui tunc dixit illis, "Removete vos et spectate ad mensam." <p>Et removerunt se et spectabant, et ecce charta illa lucebat sicut stella. <p>Et tunc dixit custos, "Videtis quod vera sint, quae Vos chartae inscripsistis: sed accedite propius, ac intuitum Vestrum figite in charta." <p>Et fecerunt ita, et subito tunc lux disparata est, et charta facta est nigra; sicut fuligine fornacis inducta. <p>Et porro dixit custos, "Tangite chartam manibus vestris, <p>sed cavete ne tangatis scripturam." <p>Et cum fecerunt ita, flamma erupit et consumpsit. His visis aufugerunt; et dicebatur illis, "Si tetigissetis scripturas, audivissetis strepitus, et combussissetis digitos vestros." <p>Et tunc dictum est ab adstantibus a tergo, "Vidistis nunc quod veritates quibus abusi estis ad confirmandum justificationis vestrae arcana, sint veritates in se, sed quod sint veritates falsificatae in vobis." <p>Illi tunc suspexerunt, et apparuit illis Caelum sicut sanguis, <p>et postea sicut caligo; et ipsi visi sunt coram oculis spirituum angelicorum quidam sicut vespertiliones, quidam sicut noctuae, quidam sicut talpae, et quidam sicut bubones. Ac aufugerunt in tenebras suas, quae coram oculis illorum fatue lucebant. <p>Spiritus angelici, qui aderant, mirati sunt quia de loco illo et de mensa ibi non aliquid prius sciverunt; et tunc vox ad illos e meridionali plaga venit, dicens, "Accedite huc, et videbitis adhuc mirabilius." <p>Et accesserunt, et intraverunt in cameram cujus parietes fulgebant sicut ex auro, et viderunt ibi quoque mensam, super qua jacuit Verbum circumcinctum lapidibus pretiosis in forma caelesti. <p>Et dixit Angelus custos, "Dum aperitur Verbum, emicat inde lux candoris ineffabilis, et tunc simul ex lapidibus pretiosis apparet iris supra et circum Verbum. Quando aliquis angelus e Caelo tertio illuc venit et spectat Verbum apertum, apparet supra et circum Verbum iris diversicolor in plano caeruleo; dum angelus e Caelo secundo illuc venit et spectat, apparet iris in plano caeruleo; dum angelus ex ultimo Caelo venit et spectat, apparet iris in plano candido; dum aliquis spiritus bonus venit et spectat, apparet variegatio lucis sicut marmoris." <p>Quod ita sit, etiam ad oculum illis ostensum est. <p>Porro dixit Angelus custos, "Si quis accedit qui falsificaverat Verbum, tunc primum dissipatur splendor; et si appropinquat, et figit oculos in Verbo, fit sicut sanguis circum, et tunc monetur ut discedat quia periculum est." <p>At quidam, qui in mundo fuerat auctor antesignanus Doctrinae de Sola Fide, audacter accessit, et dixit. "Ego dum fui in mundo non falsificavi Verbum; exaltavi una cum fide etiam charitatem, et docui quod homo in statu fidei in quo facit charitatem et ejus opera, renovetur, regeneretur et sanctificetur; tum quod fides tunc non detur solitaria, hoc est, absque bonis operibus, sicut non arbor absque fructu, sol absque luce, et ignis absque calore; et quoque culpavi illos qui dixerunt quod bona opera non essent necessaria, ac insuper quod praecepta Decalogi, et quoque paenitentiam, magnifecerim; et quod sic mirabili modo omnia Verbi applicuerim articulo de Fide, quam usque solam salvificam esse detexi et demonstravi." <p>Ille in fiducia assertionis suae quod non falsificaverit Verbum, accessit ad mensam, et contra monitum Angeli tetigit Verbum. At tunc subito effluxit ignis cum fumo ex Verbo, et facta est explosio cum ingenti fragore, ex quo ille conjectus est ad angulum camerae, et ibi jacuit per horulam sicut mortuus. <p>Hoc mirati sunt spiritus angelici, sed dictum est illis, quod ille Praesul prae reliquis exaltaverit bona charitatis sicut procedentia ex fide; sed quod usque non intellexerit alia opera quam politica, quae etiam vocantur moralia et civilia, quae propter mundum et prosperitatem ibi facienda sunt, non autem aliqua opera quae facienda sunt propter Deum et salutem; tum quod etiam supposuerit Opera inconspicua a Spiritu Sancto, de quibus homo nihil scit, quae ingenerantur actui Fidei in statu ejus. <p>Tunc locuti sunt spiritus angelici inter se de falsificatione Verbi, et in eo convenerunt, quod falsificare Verbum, sit desumere ex illo vera, et applicare illa ad confirmandum falsa, quod est extrahere illa ex Verbo extra illud, et occidere. Ut pro exemplo: qui desumit inde hoc verum, quod proximus amandus sit, et quod bonum illi ex amore faciendum sit propter Deum et vitam aeternam. si tunc quis confirmat illud quod faciendum sit, sed non salutis causa, quia omne bonum ab homine non est bonum, ille trahit id verum ex Verbo extra Verbum, et trucidat illud; quoniam Dominus in Verbo Suo injungit cuivis homini qui salvari vult, facere bonum proximo sicut a se, et tamen credere quod sit a Domino. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;quisque pro "cuivis" (Vid. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_566/swedenborg_vera-christiana-religio_162" target=_top>VCR 162</a>.)" </p>
