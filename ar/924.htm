<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第924节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>924.启21:26.“凡不洁净的，并那行可憎与虚谎之事的，总不得进那城”表那些玷污圣言的良善，歪曲圣言的真理，并出于确认，因而也出于虚假作恶的人无一被接进主的新教会。“不得进”表示不被接纳，如前所述。“不洁净的”表示属灵的淫乱，也就是对圣言良善的玷污和对圣言真理的歪曲（<a href="702.htm">702</a>，<a href="728.htm">728</a>节），这就是不洁和不纯本身；因为圣言是洁净和纯洁本身，当被败坏时，就被邪恶与虚假玷污。通奸和行淫对应于对圣言良善的玷污和对圣言真理的歪曲（参看<a href="134.htm">134</a>，<a href="632.htm">632</a>节）。“行可憎与虚谎之事”表示行恶，因而行虚假。“可憎之事”表示各种邪恶，尤其十诫所提到的那些邪恶（<a href="891.htm">891</a>节）；“虚谎”表示各种虚假，在此表示邪恶的虚假，这些虚假本身就是邪恶，因而表示确认邪恶的虚假，它们与确认的邪恶是一样的。</p><p>“虚谎”之所以表示教义的虚假，是因为属灵的谎言并不是别的什么；因此，“行虚谎之事”表示照着教义的虚假生活。在圣言中，“虚谎”（lie或译为谎言、说谎、谎诈、虚妄等）表示教义的虚假；这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>我们与死亡立约，在阴间见异象；我们以谎言为避所，在虚假中藏身。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.15.htm">28:15</a>）</p><p>他们各人欺哄自己的同伴，不说真话，他们教舌头说谎。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.5.htm">9:5</a>）</p><p>他们是悖逆的百姓，说谎的儿女，不肯听从耶和华的律法。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.9.htm">30:9</a>）</p><p>看哪！那些以虚妄之梦为预言，又述说这梦，以谎言使我百姓走错了路的，我必与他们反对。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.32.htm">23:32</a>）</p><p>卜士所见的是虚谎，所说的是幻梦。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚10.2.htm">10:2</a>）</p><p>他们所见的尽是空虚，是谎诈的占卜；因你们说的是虚假，见的是谎诈，所以，看哪，我就与你们反对。我的手必攻击说谎言的先知。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.6.htm">13:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.9.htm">9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结21.29.htm">21:29</a>）</p><p>祸哉！这流人血的城，充满谎诈和劫掠。（那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿3.1.htm">3:1</a>）</p><p>我在耶路撒冷的先知中曾见可怕的固执，他们犯奸淫，行在虚谎中。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.14.htm">23:14</a>）</p><p>从先知到祭司都行事虚谎。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.10.htm">8:10</a>）</p><p>在以色列，他们行事虚谎。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何7.1.htm">7:1</a>）</p><p>你们是出于你们的父魔鬼；他从起初是杀人的，因他心里没有真理；他说谎是出于自己说的；因他本来是说谎的，也是说谎之人的父。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.44.htm">8:44</a>）</p><p>此处“谎”也表示虚假。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 924</h4><p>924. <a href="3927/revelation_21_27.htm">21:27</a> But there shall not enter it anything unclean, or that creates an abomination or a lie. This symbolically means that no one is received into the Lord's New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, who adulterates the goods in the Word and falsifies its truths, and who does evils deliberately and so also devises falsities.<p>Not to enter in means, symbolically, not to be received, as before. Something unclean symbolizes spiritual licentiousness, which is an adulteration of the Word's goodness and a falsification of its truth (nos. <a href="702.htm">702</a>, <a href="728.htm">728</a>). For this is absolutely unclean and impure, inasmuch as the Word is absolutely clean and pure, and it is defiled with evils and falsities when it is corrupted. That adultery and licentiousness correspond to an adulteration of the Word's goodness and a falsification of its truth may be seen in nos. <a href="134.htm">134</a>, <a href="632.htm">632</a>. To create an abomination or a lie means, symbolically, to do evils and so also to devise falsities. Abominations symbolize evils of every kind, especially those named in the Ten Commandments (no. <a href="891.htm">891</a>), and a lie symbolizes falsities of every kind, here the falsities that accompany evil, which in themselves are evils. Thus they are falsities used to justify evil, which are the same as evils affirmed.<p>A lie symbolizes doctrinal falsity because that is what a spiritual lie is. To create a lie, therefore, symbolically means to live in accordance with doctrinal falsities.</p><p>[2] That a lie in the Word symbolizes doctrinal falsity may be seen from the following passages:<p>We have made a covenant with death, and with hell we have produced a vision... ...we have made a lie our refuge, and in falsehood we have hidden ourselves. (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>)<p>Everyone deceives his neighbor, and they do not speak the truth; they have taught their tongue to speak a lie. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_9_5.htm">Jeremiah 9:5</a>)<p>...this is a rebellious people, lying children..., who will not hear the law of Jehovah. (<a href="3927/isaiah_30_9.htm">Isaiah 30:9</a>)<p>Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams..., and tell them in order to lead My people astray by their lies... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_32.htm">Jeremiah 23:32</a>)<p>The diviners see a lie, and speak false dreams. (<a href="3927/zechariah_10_2.htm">Zechariah 10:2</a>)<p>(The diviners) see vanity and a lying divination... Therefore..., because you speak vanity and see a lie, behold, for that reason I am against you..., (so that) My hand is against the prophets who speak... a lie. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_13_6.htm">Ezekiel 13:6-9</a>, cf. <a href="3927/ezekiel_21_29.htm">21:29</a>)<p>Woe to the bloody city! It is all full of lying and robbery. (<a href="3927/nahum_3_1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>)<p>In the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a shocking obstinacy, committing adultery and walking in lies. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>)<p>From the prophet even to the priest, everyone devises lies. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_8_10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>)<p>(In Israel) they have devised lies. (<a href="3927/hosea_7_1.htm">Hosea 7:1</a>)<p>You are of your father the devil... He was a murderer from the beginning..., because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own, for he is the speaker of a lie and the father of it. (<a href="3927/john_8_44.htm">John 8:44</a>)<p>Here, too, a lie means falsity. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 924</h4><p>924. [verse 26] 'And there shall not enter into it any unclean thing, nor one doing abomination and a lie' signifies that no one is received into the Lord's New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, who adulterates the goods and falsifies the truths of the Word, and who does evils from confirmation, and thus also untruths. By 'not to enter' is signified not to receive, as above. By 'an unclean thing' is signified spiritual whoredom, which is the adulteration of the good and falsification of the truth of the Word (<a href="720.htm">720</a>, <a href="728.htm">728</a>), for this is uncleanness and impurity itself; because the Word is cleanness and purity itself, and this is defiled by evils and untruths when it is perverted. That adultery and whoredom correspond to the adulteration of good and the falsification of the truth of the Word may be seen (<a href="134.htm">134</a>, <a href="632.htm">632</a>). By 'to do abomination and a lie' is signified to do evils and thus also untruths. By 'abominations' are signified evils of all kinds, especially those that are named in the Decalogue (<a href="891.htm">891</a>); and by 'a lie' are signified untruths of every kind, here untruths of evil that in themselves are evils, thus untruths confirming evil, which are the same as the evils confirmed.</p><p>[2] The reason why 'a lie' signifies untruth of doctrine is because a spiritual lie is nothing else; consequently by 'to do a lie' is signified to live in accordance with an untruth of doctrine. That 'a lie' in the Word signifies untruth of doctrine can be established from the following passages:<p>We have entered into a covenant with death, and with hell have we made a vision, we have put our trust in a lie, and in falsity have we hidden ourselves. <a href="3927/isaiah_28_15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>.<p>They are mocking, a man at his companion, and are not speaking the truth (veritas), and they have taught their tongue to speak a lie. <a href="3927/jeremiah_9_4.htm">Jeremiah 9:4</a>.<p>This is a people of rebellion, lying sons, they are not willing to hear the law of Jehovah. <a href="3927/isaiah_30_9.htm">Isaiah 30:9</a>.<p>Behold, I am against those prophesying the dreams of a lie; they narrate them that they may lead My people astray by their lies. <a href="3927/jeremiah_23_32.htm">Jeremiah 23:32</a>.<p>The diviners are seeing a lie, and are speaking dreams of vanity, <a href="3927/zechariah_10_2.htm">Zechariah 10:2</a>.<p>They have seen vanity and the divination of a lie; because you are speaking vanity and seeing a lie, therefore behold I am against you, that My hand may be against the prophets speaking a lie. <a href="3927/ezekiel_13_6.htm">Ezekiel 13:6-9</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_21_29.htm">21:29</a> [H.B. 34].<p>Woe to the city of bloods, it is all a lie and full of robbery, <a href="3927/nahum_3_1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>.<p>In the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible obduracy, in committing adultery and walking in a lie. <a href="3927/jeremiah_23_14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>.<p>From the prophet even unto the priest, everyone is doing a lie. <a href="3927/jeremiah_8_10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>.<p>In Israel they have done a lie, <a href="3927/hosea_7_1.htm">Hosea 7:1</a>.<p>You are of your father the devil, he was a murderer from the beginning, because the truth is not in him, when he is speaking a lie he is speaking out of his own things, because he is speaking a lie, and is the father of it. <a href="3927/john_8_44.htm">John 8:44</a>.<p>Here also by 'a lie' is understood untruth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 924</h4><p>924. Verse 26. And there shall not enter into it any unclean thing and that doeth abomination, and a lie, signifies that no one will be received into the Lord's New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, who adulterates the goods and falsifies the truths of the Word, and who does evils from confirmation and thus also falsifies. "Not to enter in," signifies not to be received, as above; by "unclean" is signified spiritual whoredom, which is adulteration of the good and falsification of the truth of the Word, (<a href="702.htm">702</a>, <a href="728.htm">728</a>); for this is uncleanness and impurity itself, because the Word is cleanness and purity itself, and this is defiled by evils and falsities when it is perverted; that adultery and whoredom correspond to the adulteration of the good and the falsification of the truth of the Word, may be seen, (<a href="134.htm">134</a>, <a href="632.htm">632</a>).

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 924 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>924. (Vers. 26.) "Et non intrabit in illam ullum immundum, et faciens abominationem et mendacium" significat quod nemo in novam Domini. Ecclesiam, quae est Nova Hierosolyma, recipiatur, qui adulterat bona et falsificat vera Verbi, et qui jacit mala ex confirmatione et sic quoque falsa. - Per "non intrare" significatur non recipi, ut supra; per "immundum" significatur scortatio spiritualis, quae est adulteratio boni et falsificatio veri Verbi (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_702" target=_top>702</a> et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_728" target=_top>728</a>) <sup>1</sup>hoc enim est ipsum immundum et impurum, quia Verbum est ipsum mundum et purum, et hoc conspurcatur a malis et falsis cum pervertitur; quod adulterium et scortatio correspondeat adulterationi boni et falsificationi veri Verbi, videatur, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_34" target=_top>34</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_632" target=_top>632</a>; per "facere abominationem et mendacium" significatur facere mala et sic quoque falsa; per "abominationes" significantur omnis generis mala, imprimis quae nominantur in Decalogo (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_891" target=_top>891</a>); et per "mendacium" significantur omnis generis falsa, hic, falsa mali, quae in se sunt mala, ita falsa confirmantia malum, quae eadem sunt cum malis confirmatis. Quod "mendacium" significet falsum doctrinae, est quia mendacium spirituale non aliud est; inde per "facere mendacium" significatur vivere secundum falsa doctrinae. Quod "mendacium" in Verbo significet falsum doctrinae, constare potest ex sequentibus locis: <p>"Excidimus foedus cum Morte, et cum Inferno fecimus visionem; posuimus Mendacium fiduciam, et in Falsitate latuimus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_28_15" target=_top>Esaias 28:15</a>);<p>"Vir socio suo illudunt, et veritatem non loquuntur, et docuerunt linguam suam loqui Mendacium," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_9_4" target=_top>Jeremias 9:4</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_9_5" target=_top>5</a>));<p>"Populus rebellionis ille <sup>2</sup>filii Mendaces, non volunt audire legem Jehovae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_30_9" target=_top>Esaias 30:9</a>);<p>"Ecce Ego contra prophetantes somnia Mendacii; narrant ea ut seducant populum Meum per Mendacia sua," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_23_32" target=_top>Jeremias 23:32</a>); "Divinatores vident Mendacium, et somnia vanitatis loquuntur," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_10_2" target=_top>Sacharias 10:2</a>);<p>"Viderunt vanitatem et divinationem Mendacii; propterea quod loquimini vanitatem et videtis Mendacium, ideo ecce Ego contra vos; ut sit manus Mea contra prophetas loquentes Mendacium," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_12_6-9" target=_top>Ezechiel 12:6-9</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_21_1-32" target=_top>21</a>:34 (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_21_29" target=_top>29</a>)); <sup>3</sup><p>"Vae urbi sanguinum, tota Mendacio et rapina plena," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_nahum_3_1" target=_top>Nahum 3:1</a>);<p>"In prophetis Hierosolymae vidi obfirmationem horrendam, adulterando et eundo in Mendacio," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_23_14" target=_top>Jeremias 23:14</a>);<p>"Propheta usque ad sacerdotem, quivis facit Mendacium," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_8_10" target=_top>Jeremias 8:10</a>);<p>In Israele "fecerunt Mendacium," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_hosea_7_1" target=_top>Hoschea 7:1</a>);<p>"Vos ex patre Diabolo estis; ille homicida fuit ab initio, quia non veritas in illo; quando loquitur Mendacium, ex propriis loquitur, quia Mendacium loquens est, et pater ejus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_924/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_8_44" target=_top>Johannes 8:44</a>);<p>hic etiam per "mendacium" intelligitur falsum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;728 pro "708"<p>2.&nbsp;ille pro "illi"<p>3.&nbsp;6-9 pro "16, 17, 18, 19" et 34 pro "24" </p>
