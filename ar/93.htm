<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第93节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>93.“死过又活的”表祂在教会被漠视，祂的人性不被承认为神性，然而在这方面也唯独祂是生命，永生唯独来自祂。这就是本句经文的含义，可参看上文（<a href="58.htm">58</a>-60节），那里解释这句话。之所说这些以及刚才那些话，是因为该教会所描述那些人的主要错误在于不承认主的神性人，因而不靠近祂。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 93</h4><p>93. "'Who was dead, and is alive.'" This symbolically means that He has been disregarded in the church and His humanity not acknowledged to be Divine, even though in respect to it, too, He alone is life and the only source of eternal life.<p>That this is the meaning may be seen in nos. <a href="58.htm">58-60</a> above, where these words have been explained.<p>This statement and the one immediately preceding it are made because the primary falsity of the people described by this church is their failure to acknowledge the Lord's Divine humanity, and therefore they do not go to Him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 93</h4><p>93. 'Who was dead and is alive' signifies that in the Church He has been disregarded, and His Human has not been acknowledged to be Divine, when yet in respect to that also He Only is Life and eternal life is from Him Only. That by those words these things are understood may be seen above (<a href="58.htm">58-60</a>), where they have been expounded. These and the things just before are said because the primary untruth of those who are described by means of this Church is that they do not acknowledge the Lord's Divine Human, and therefore do not approach Him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 93</h4><p>93. Who was dead and is alive, signifies that He is neglected in the church, and His Human is not acknowledged to be Divine, when yet as to that also He alone is life, and from Him alone is eternal life. That this is meant by these words, may be seen above, (<a href="58.htm">58-60</a>), where they are explained. Why these and the preceding things are said, is, because the primary falsity of those who are described by this church, is, that they do not acknowledge the Lord's Divine Human, and therefore do not approach Him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 93 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>93. "Qui fuit mortuus et vivit," significat quod in Ecclesia neglectus sit, et Humanum Ipsius non agnitum Divinum. tum tamen quoad Illud etiam Solus est Vita, et ad Ipso Solo Vita aeterna. - Quod haec per illa verba intelligantur, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_93/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_58" target=_top>58-60</a>), ubi explicata sunt. Quod haec et mox priora dicantur, est quia primarium falsum illorum qui per hanc Ecclesiam describuntur, est, quod non agnoscant Divinum Humanum Domini, et ideo Ipsum non adeunt. </p>
