<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第762节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>762.启18:6.“她怎样待你，也要怎样待她，按她所行的加倍地报应她。用她调酒的杯，加倍地调给她喝”表死后正义的报应和惩罚，那时他们用来迷惑并毁灭他人的邪恶与虚假将照其量和质而报应到他们身上，这就是所谓的报应法则（the law of retaliation）。“她怎样待你，也要怎样待她”表示死后正义的报应和惩罚。“按她所行的加倍地报应她”表示他们用来迷惑并毁灭他人的邪恶与虚假将照其量和质而报应到他们身上。“用她调酒的杯，加倍地调给她喝”表示虚假将同样报应到他们身上；因为“杯”或“酒”表示虚假（<a href="316.htm">316</a>，<a href="635.htm">635</a>，<a href="649.htm">649</a>，<a href="672.htm">672</a>节）。在先知书中，几乎同样的话论及巴比伦：</p><p>照着巴比伦所做的报应她，她怎样待人，也要怎样待她，因为她向耶和华以色列的圣者发了狂傲。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 50.29.htm"> 50:29</a>）</p><p>这是耶和华报仇的事，你们要向巴比伦报仇；她怎样待人，也要怎样待她。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 50.15.htm"> 50:15</a>）</p><p>巴比伦女子被毁灭，报复你像你待我们的，那人便为有福。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗137.8.htm">137:8</a>）</p><p>按照字义，似乎是他们所迷惑并毁灭的人要报应他们；但按照灵义，这些人不会报应他们，而是他们自己报应自己，因为一切邪恶自带惩罚。这种情形类似于圣言各处所说的话，即：神将因向祂自己所行的不义和罪孽而报应和报复，并由于愤恨和烈怒毁灭他们；而事实上，是那些反对神的恶人自己这样行，因而向自己行这一切。这就是报应的法则，该法则就来源于这条神性律法：</p><p>无论何事，你们愿意人怎样待你们，你们也要怎样待人；因为这就是律法和先知。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.12.htm">7:12</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.31.htm">6:31</a>）</p><p>在天堂，这条法则就是相爱或仁爱的法则，由此在地狱所产生的是对立的法则，就是，你怎样待人，人怎样待你。不是说那些在天堂的人这样做，而是他们对自己这样做，因为地狱的报应法则和天堂的报应法则正好对立，并且如同被铭刻在他们的邪恶上。</p><p>在以下经文中，“加倍”表示根据量和质而有大量：</p><p>愿那些逼迫我的蒙羞，使灾祸的日子临到他们，以加倍的毁坏毁坏他们。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.18.htm">17:18</a>）</p><p>在以下经文中，表示根据他们转离邪恶的量和质而有大量：</p><p>安慰我的百姓，她服役期已经满了，她的罪孽赦免了，她从耶和华手中加倍受罚。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.1.htm">40:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>你们被囚而有指望的人都要转回保障，我今日说明，我必加倍赐福给你们。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.12.htm">9:12</a>）</p><p>你们因所受的羞辱必得加倍的好处；在他们的地内，他们必得加倍的产业，永远之乐必归与他们。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 61.7.htm"> 61:7</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 762</h4><p>762. <a href="3927/revelation_18_6.htm">18:6</a> "Render to her as she rendered to you, repay her double according to her works; in the cup which she has mixed, mix double for her." This symbolizes a just retribution and punishment after death, that the evils and falsities with which Roman Catholics led astray and destroyed others will, in accordance with the magnitude and character of them, come back upon themselves, which is called the lex talionis (law of retaliation).<p>"Render to her as she rendered to you" symbolizes their just retribution and punishment after death. "Repay her double according to her works" means symbolically that the evils with which they led astray and destroyed others will, in accordance with the magnitude and character of them, come back upon themselves. "In the cup which she has mixed, mix double for her," means symbolically that their falsities will likewise come back upon themselves; for a cup or wine symbolizes falsities (nos. <a href="316.htm">316</a>, <a href="635.htm">635</a>, <a href="649.htm">649</a>, <a href="672.htm">672</a>).<p>Almost the same statement is made of Babylon in the Prophets:<p>Repay (Babylon) according to her work; according to all she has done, do to her; for she has behaved insolently against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>)<p>...the vengeance of Jehovah (is this): Take vengeance on (Babylon). As she has done, so do to her. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_15.htm">Jeremiah 50:15</a>)<p>The daughter of Babylon has been destroyed. Blessed is the one who repays you your retribution as you have repaid us! (<a href="3927/psalms_137_8.htm">Psalms 137:8</a>)</p><p>[2] According to the literal meaning, people whom Roman Catholics have led astray and destroyed are to visit retribution on them. But according to the spiritual meaning, it is not they who are to visit retribution on those Roman Catholics, but those Roman Catholics themselves, because every evil carries with it its own punishment. The case is similar to when the Word says here and there that God will visit retribution and avenge injustices and injuries done to Him, and will be moved by anger and wrath to destroy people, when in fact it is the evils done against God themselves that do this, thus the people themselves who do it to themselves.<p>This is, indeed, the lex talionis or law of retaliation, which takes its origin from the following Divine law:<p>Everything whatever you wish people to do to you, do you also to them. This is the Law and the Prophets. (<a href="3927/matthew_7_12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>, cf. <a href="3927/luke_6_31.htm">Luke 6:31</a>)<p>In heaven this law is one of mutual love or charity, from which arises its opposite in hell, namely, that everyone has done to him as he has done to another - not that it is done to them by anyone in heaven, but that they do it to themselves. For the retribution of the lex talionis arises from its opposition to the aforesaid law of life in heaven, as a law engraved on their evils.</p><p>[3] Double symbolizes much in accordance with the magnitude and character of a thing also in the following place:<p>Let my persecutors be shamed! ...Bring on them the day of evil, and shatter them with double shattering! (<a href="3927/jeremiah_17_18.htm">Jeremiah 17:18</a>)<p>And much in accordance with the magnitude and character of people's turning away from evils in the following:<p>Comfort... My people! ...that her warfare is ended, that her iniquity is atoned for; for she has received from Jehovah's hand double... (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_1.htm">Isaiah 40:1-2</a>)<p>Return to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope. This day I declare the double that I will repay to you. (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_12.htm">Zechariah 9:12</a>)<p>Instead of your shame you shall have double, and... in their land they shall possess double; everlasting joy shall be theirs. (<a href="3927/isaiah_61_7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 762</h4><p>762. [verse 6] 'Render unto her even as she has rendered unto you, double unto her double in accordance with her works, in the cup that she has mixed mix unto her double' signifies the just retribution and penalty after death, that then the evils and untruths with which they have led others astray and destroyed them are going to return upon themselves in accordance with the quantity and quality thereof, which is called the law of retaliation (jus talionis). 'Render unto her even as she has rendered unto you' signifies the just retribution and penalty after death. 'Double unto her double in accordance with her works' signifies that the evils with which they have led others astray and destroyed them are going to return upon themselves in accordance with the quantity and quality thereof. 'In the cup that she has mixed mix unto her double' signifies that the untruths [are going to return] in like manner; for by 'the cup' or wine, untruths are signified (<a href="316.htm">316</a>, <a href="635.htm">635</a>, <a href="649.htm">649</a>, <a href="672.htm">672</a>) <sup>1</sup>. Things almost the same are said of Babel in the prophets:<p>Pay Babel back according to her work, according to all that she has done do unto her, for she has acted insolently against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel. <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>.<p>This is the vengeance of Jehovah, take vengeance on Babel; even as she has done, do unto her. <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_15.htm">Jeremiah 50:15</a>.<p>The daughter of Babylon has been devastated, happy is he who shall pay back to thee thy retribution as thou hast repaid us. <a href="3927/psalms_137_8.htm">Psalms 137:8</a>.</p><p>[2] It is in accordance with the sense of the letter that those whom they have led astray and destroyed are going to pay them back, but it is in accordance with the spiritual sense that those will not do this to them but they will do it to themselves, because every evil carries its own penalty with it. This is similar to what is said in various places in the Word, that God will repay and avenge the injustices and injuries done to Himself, and will destroy them in consequence of wrath and growing anger; when yet the evils themselves that they have done against God do this, thus they do it to themselves. For this is the law of retaliation (jus talionis), which takes its very origin out of this Divine Law:<p>All things whatsoever you wish that men should do to you, even so do you to then ; this is the Law and the Prophets. <a href="3927/matthew_7_12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>; <a href="3927/luke_6_31.htm">Luke 6:31</a>.<p>This law in heaven is the law of mutual love or charity, as a result of which an opposite law is made in hell, which is that to every one should be done just as he had done to another. Not that those who are in heaven do this, but that they do it to themselves, for the retribution of retaliation is the result of opposition to that law of life in heaven, as if inscribed with their evils.</p><p>[3] By 'double' is signified much in accordance with the quantity and quality, in these passages also:<p>Let my persecutors be ashamed, bring upon them a day of evil, and break them with a double breaking. <a href="3927/jeremiah_17_18.htm">Jeremiah 17:18</a>.<p>Also much in accordance with the quantity and quality of their turning from evils, in these:<p>Comfort my people, for her military service has been fulfilled and her iniquity expiated, inasmuch as she has received of Jehovah's hand double [<a href="3927/isaiah_40_1.htm">Isaiah 40:1-2</a>].<p>Return to the stronghold, O prisoners of hope, this day I am announcing the double that I will pay back to thee, <a href="3927/zechariah_9_2.htm">Zechariah 9:2</a>.<p>For your shame you shall have double; and in their land they shall possess double, they shall have the joy of eternity. <a href="3927/isaiah_61_7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Original Edition has <a href="642.htm">642</a>, clearly an error. Previous editors have amended this to <a href="649.htm">649</a> as above, but perhaps it should be 652 or 653 or it should be omitted altogether. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 762</h4><p>762. Verse 6. Render unto her even as she hath rendered unto you, double unto her double according to her works, in the cup which she hath mingled, mingle to her double, signifies the just retribution and punishment of them after death, that then the evils and falsities by which they have seduced and destroyed others will return upon them according to their quantity and quality, which is called the law of retaliation. "Render unto her even as she hath rendered unto you," signifies the just retribution and punishment of them after death. "Double unto her double according to her works," signifies that the evils by which they have seduced and destroyed others will return upon them according to their quantity and quality. "In the cup which she hath mingled, mingle to her double," signifies that the falsities will return in like manner; for by "a cup" or wine falsities are signified, (<a href="316.htm">316</a>, <a href="635.htm">635</a>, <a href="649.htm">649</a>, <a href="672.htm">672</a>). Nearly the same things are said of Babel in the prophets:<p>Recompense unto Babel according to her work, according to all that she hath done, do unto her, for she hath acted insolently against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>).<p>This is the vengeance of Jehovah; take ye vengeance on Babel; as she hath done, do unto her, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_15.htm">Jeremiah 50:15</a>).<p>The daughter of Babel is devastated; happy is he that rendereth to thee thy retribution which thou hast rendered unto us, (<a href="3927/psalms_137_8.htm">Psalms 137:8</a>).</p><p>[2] It is according to the sense of the letter, that those whom they have seduced and destroyed will bring retribution on them; but it is according to the spiritual sense, that they will not do this to them, but these do it to themselves; because every evil brings its own punishment with itself. This is similar to what is said frequently in the Word, that God will bring retribution and vengeance for injustices and injuries done to Himself, and from anger and wrath will destroy them; when yet the evils themselves which they have committed against God do this; thus they do it to themselves; for this is the law of retaliation, which draws its very origin from this Divine law:<p>All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets, (<a href="3927/matthew_7_12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>; <a href="3927/luke_6_31.htm">Luke 6:31</a>).<p>This law in heaven is the law of mutual love or charity, from which it becomes the opposite in hell, which is, that to everyone it is done as he had done to another; not that they who are in heaven do this, but that they do it to themselves; for the retribution of retaliation is from opposition to that law of life in heaven, as if inscribed on their evils.</p><p>[3] By "double" is signified much according to quantity and quality in this passage also:<p>Let my persecutors be ashamed, bring upon them the day of evil, and break them with a double breaking, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_17_18.htm">Jeremiah 17:18</a>).<p>Also much according to the quantity and quality of their turning away from evils, in these:<p>Comfort ye My people, because her warfare <sup>1</sup>is fulfilled, and her iniquity is expiated; for she hath received from the hand of Jehovah double, (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_1.htm">Isaiah 40:1-2</a>).<p>Return to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope; this day I announce, I will recompense unto thee double, (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_12.htm">Zechariah 9:12</a>).<p>For your shame ye shall have double, and in their land they shall possess the double, everlasting joy shall be unto them, (<a href="3927/isaiah_61_7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original Latin has "malitia" for "militia," "wickedness" for "warfare." </p>
