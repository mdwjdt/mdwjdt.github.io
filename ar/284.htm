<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>284.“我们要在地上掌权”表他们将进入主的国度，主在他们里面，他们在主里面。照主的话说，“在地上掌权”无非是指进入主的国度，在那里与主合而为一：</p><p>使凡信我的人都合而为一；正如你父在我里面，我在你里面那样合而为一，使他们也在我们里面，合而为一；你所赐给我的荣耀，我已赐给他们，使他们合而为一，像我们合而为一。我在他们里面，你在我里面，我在哪里，他们也同我在那里。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.20.htm">17:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.24.htm">24</a>）</p><p>既然他们如此与主合而为一，并与主同在，组成一个国度，被称为“神的国”，那么显然，“掌权”并不表示别的。经上之所以说“掌权”，是因为前面说“叫我们成为君王和祭司”；“君王”表示那些处于源自主的神性真理的智慧之人；“祭司”表示那些处于源自主的神性良善的爱之人（<a href="20.htm">20</a>节）。因此，主的国也被称为“圣民的国”（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.18.htm">7:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.27.htm">27</a>）。论到使徒，经上说：</p><p>他们要与主审判以色列十二个支派。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.28.htm">19:28</a>）</p><p>然而，唯独主审判并掌权；因为祂凭神性良善藉神性真理审判和掌权，这神性真理也通过主而在他们里面。谁若以为通过主而在他们里面的东西是他自己的，就会被逐出天国，即被逐出天堂。以下启示录经文中的“掌权”意思也一样：</p><p>他们必作神和基督的祭司，并要与基督一同掌权一千年。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.4.htm">20:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>论到那些将要进入新耶路撒冷的人：</p><p>羔羊要光照他们，他们要掌权，世世无穷。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.5.htm">22:5</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 284</h4><p>284. "And we shall reign on the earth." This symbolically means, and they will dwell in His kingdom, He in them and they in Him.<p>To reign on the earth means nothing other than to be in the Lord's kingdom and to be united with Him in it, according to these words of the Lord:<p>...that all (those who believe in Me) may be one; (and one) as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, that they also may be one in Us... The glory which You gave Me I have given to them, that they may be one as We are one, I in them, and You in Me..., that they also... may be with Me where I am... (<a href="3927/john_17_20.htm">John 17:20-24</a>)<p>So then, since they are thus one with the Lord, and together with the Lord form the kingdom that is called the kingdom of God, it is apparent that nothing else is symbolically meant by reigning.<p>Reigning is mentioned because of the prior statement, "You have made us kings and priests;" and because kings symbolize people who are governed by wisdom springing from Divine truths from the Lord, and priests symbolize people who are governed by love springing from Divine good from Him (no. <a href="20.htm">20</a>).<p>It is because of this that the Lord's kingdom is also called a kingdom of saints (<a href="3927/daniel_7_18.htm">Daniel 7:18</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_27.htm">27</a>); and of the Apostles it is said that with the Lord they will judge the twelve tribes of Israel (<a href="3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>), even though it is the Lord alone who judges and reigns. For He judges and reigns from Divine good by means of Divine truth, which they have in them as well from Him. But anyone who believes that what they have from the Lord is something of their own, is expelled from the kingdom, that is, from heaven.<p>Reigning has the same symbolic meaning in the following places in the book of Revelation:<p>...they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years. (<a href="3927/revelation_20_6.htm">Revelation 20:6</a>, cf. <a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">20:4</a>)<p>And of those who will come into the New Jerusalem, it is said:<p>(The Lamb) gives them light. And they shall reign forever and ever. (<a href="3927/revelation_22_5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a> [cf. <a href="3927/revelation_21_23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>]) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 284</h4><p>284. 'And we shall reign over the land' signifies and they will be in His kingdom, He in them and they in Him. By 'reign over the land' nothing else is understood than to be in the Lord's kingdom and to be one with Him there in accordance with these words of the Lord:<p>That all who believe in Me may be one; and may be one as Thou Father art in Me and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us. The glory which Thou hast given Me I have given them, that they may be one as We are One, I in them and Thou in Me, that where I am, they also may be with Me. <a href="3927/john_17_20.htm">John 17:20-24</a>.<p>Since, therefore, they are in this manner one with the Lord and, together with the Lord, make the kingdom that is called the kingdom of God, it is plain that nothing else is signified by 'reign.' 'Reign' is said because it was before said, 'Thou hast made us kings and priests,' and by 'kings' are signified those who are in wisdom out of Divine Truths from the Lord, and by 'priests' those who are in love out of Divine Good from Him (<a href="20.htm">20</a>). In consequence of this the Lord's kingdom is also said to be a 'kingdom of the saints' (<a href="3927/daniel_7_18.htm">Daniel 7:18</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_27.htm">27</a>); and it is said of the Apostles, that 'with the Lord they are going to judge the twelve tribes of Israel' (<a href="3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>); although the Only Lord judges and reigns, for He judges and reigns out of the Divine Good by means of the Divine Truth that is also in them from Himself. He, however, who believes that what is in them from the Lord is theirs is cast out of the kingdom, that is, out of heaven. The like is signified by 'reign' in the following statements in the Apocalypse:<p>They shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years. <a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_6.htm">6</a>; and concerning those who are going to be in the New Jerusalem:<p>The Lamb shall enlighten them, and they shall reign for ages of ages. <a href="3927/revelation_22_5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 284</h4><p>284. And we shall reign upon the earth, signifies, and will be in His kingdom, He in them and they in Him. By "reigning upon the earth," nothing else is meant, than being in the Lord's kingdom, and there one with Him, according to these words of the Lord:<p>That all who believe in Me, may be one; and may be one as Thou Father art in Me and I in Thee, that they also may be one in us; And the glory which thou gavest Me I have given them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them and Thou in Me, that where I am, they also may be with Me, (<a href="3927/john_17_20.htm">John 17:20-24</a>).<p>As, therefore, they are thus one with the Lord, and, together with the Lord, constitute a kingdom, which is called the kingdom of God, it is evident that nothing else is signified by "reigning." It is said "to reign" because it was before said, "Thou hast made us kings and priests;" and by "kings" are signified they who are in wisdom from Divine truths from the Lord; and by "priests," they who are in love from Divine good from Him, (<a href="20.htm">20</a>); hence it is that the kingdom of the Lord is also called "the kingdom of the saints" (<a href="3927/daniel_7_18.htm">Daniel 7:18</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_27.htm">27</a>); and it is said of the apostles, that:<p>With the Lord they should judge the twelve tribes of Israel, (<a href="3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>).<p>Nevertheless the Lord alone judges and reigns; for He judges and reigns from Divine good by Divine truth, which is also from Him in them; but he who believes, that what is in them from the Lord is their own, is cast out of the kingdom, that is, out of heaven. The signification of "reigning" is the same in the following passages in Revelation:<p>They shall be priests of God and Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years, (<a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_6.htm">6</a>).<p>And concerning those who are to enter into the New Jerusalem:<p>The Lamb shall enlighten them, and they shall reign for ages of ages, (<a href="3927/revelation_22_5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 284 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>284. "Et regnabimus super terra;" significat et erunt in Regno Ipsius, Ipse in illis et illi in Ipso. - Per "regnare super terra" non aliud intelligitur quam esse in Regno Domini, et ibi unum cum Ipso, secundum haec Domini verba: <p>"Ut omnes qui credunt in Me, unum sint: ac unum sint sicut Tu Pater in Me et Ego in Te, ut etiam illi in nobis unum sint: Ego gloriam quam dedisti Mihi, dedi illis, ut sint unum sicut Nos unum sumus, Ego in illis et Tu in Me, ut ubi Ego sum etiam illi sint Mecum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_284/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_17_20-24" target=_top>Johannes 17:20-24</a>);<p>cum itaque ita unum sunt cum Domino, et simul cum Domino faciunt Regnum, quod vocatur Regnum Dei, patet quod non aliud per "regnare" significetur. Dicitur "regnare" quia prius dictum est, "Fecisti nos Reges et Sacerdotes," et per "Reges" significantur qui in sapientia ex Divinis Veris a Domino sunt, et per "Sacerdotes" qui in amore ex Divino Bono ab Ipso sunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_284/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_20" target=_top>20</a>); inde est, quod Regnum Domini etiam dicatur "Regnum sanctorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_284/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_7_18" target=_top>Daniel 7:18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_284/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_7_27" target=_top>27</a>) <sup>1</sup><p>et de Apostolis, quod Cum Domino judicaturi sint duodecim Tribus Israelis, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_284/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_19_28" target=_top>Matthaeus 19:28</a>), <p>tametsi Solus Dominus judicat et regnat; judicat enim et regnat ex Divino Bono per Divinum Verum quod ab Ipso etiam in illis est; sed qui credit quod id quod a Domino in illis est, sit illorum, ejicitur e Regno, hoc est, e Caelo. Simile per "regnare" significatur in sequentibus in Apocalypsi: <p>"Erunt Sacerdotes Dei et Christi, et Regnabunt cum Ipso mille annis, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_284/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_4" target=_top>20:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_284/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_6" target=_top>6</a>);<p>et de illis qui in Novam Hierosolymam venturi sunt, <p>"Agnus illustrabit illos, et Regnabunt in saecula saeculorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_284/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_22_5" target=_top>22:5</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;vii. pro "vii." </p>
