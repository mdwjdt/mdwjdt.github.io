<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>954.“我是大卫的根和后裔，是明亮的晨星”表祂就是那曾生在世上，当时是光，并将以出现在祂的新教会，也就圣耶路撒冷面前的新光到来的主自己。“我是大卫的根和后裔”表示祂就是那曾生在世上的主自己，因而是在其中神性人身中的主；祂由此被称为“大卫的根和后裔”，还被称为“大卫的苗裔”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.5.htm">23:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.15.htm">33:15</a>），以及“从耶西的树墩子所发的一条，从他根生的枝子”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.1.htm">11:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.2.htm">2</a>）。“明亮的晨星”表示当时祂是光，并且祂将以出现在祂的新教会，也就圣耶路撒冷面前的新光到来。祂因是以光降世而被称为“明亮的星”，因此，祂同样被称为“星”，以及“光”；称为“星”（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.17.htm">24:17</a>），称为“光”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.4.htm">1:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.12.htm">12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.19.htm">3:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.21.htm">21</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.5.htm">9:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.35.htm">12:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.36.htm">36</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.46.htm">46</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.16.htm">4:16</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.30.htm">2:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.32.htm">32</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.2.htm">9:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.6.htm">49:6</a>）。祂因出现在来自祂的新教会，也就是新耶路撒冷面前的光而被称为“晨星”；“星”表示来自主的光，这光本质上是智慧和聪明；“早晨”或“黎明”表示祂的到来，然后便是新教会（参看<a href="151.htm">151</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 954</h4><p>954. "I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star." This symbolically means that He is the same Lord who was born into the world and who then was its light, and who is about to come with new light, which will arise before the eyes of His New Church, which is the Holy Jerusalem.<p>I am the root and the offspring of David means, symbolically, that He is the same Lord who was born into the world, thus the Lord in His Divine humanity. That is why He is called the root and offspring of David, and also the branch of David (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15</a>). That is why He is also called a rod from the stem of Jesse, and a sprout from his roots (<a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">Isaiah 11:1-2</a>).<p>His being called the bright and morning star means, symbolically, that He was then the light, and that He is about to come with new light, which will arise before the eyes of His New Church, which is the Holy Jerusalem. He is called a bright star because of the light with which He came into the world. For that reason, too, He is called both a star and a light - a star in <a href="3927/numbers_24_17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>, and a light in <a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">John 1:4-12</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_19.htm">3:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="3927/john_9_5.htm">9:5</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">12:35-36</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_4_16.htm">Matthew 4:16</a>; <a href="3927/luke_2_30.htm">Luke 2:30-32</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_9_2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_49_6.htm">49:6</a>. He is called the morning star as well because of the light which will arise from Him before the eyes of the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem. For a star symbolizes light from the Lord, which in its essence is wisdom and understanding, and the morning or dawn symbolizes His advent and a new church then, as may be seen in no. <a href="151.htm">151</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 954</h4><p>954. 'I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright and the morning Star' signifies that He Himself is that Lord Who was born in the world and was then the Light, and Who is going to come with the new light that is going to dawn upon His New Church, which is the holy Jerusalem. 'I am the Root and the Offspring of David' signifies that He Himself is that Lord Who was born in the world, thus the Lord in His Own Divine Human. For this reason He is called 'the Root and the Offspring of David,' and also 'the branch of David' (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15</a>); also 'a Rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Sprout out of his roots' (<a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">Isaiah 11:1-2</a>). 'The bright and the morning Star' signifies that He was then the Light, and that He is going to come with the new Light that is going to dawn upon His New Church, which is the holy Jerusalem. He is called 'the bright Star' by reason of the light with which He came into the world, and therefore He is also called a 'Star' and also 'Light'; a Star (<a href="3927/numbers_24_17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>), and Light (<a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">John 1:4-12</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_19.htm">3:19-21</a>; <a href="3927/john_9_5.htm">9:5</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">12:35-36</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_4_16.htm">Matthew 4:16</a>; <a href="3927/luke_2_30.htm">Luke 2:30-32</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_9_2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/isaiah_9_1.htm">1</a>]; <a href="3927/isaiah_49_6.htm">49:6</a>). And He is called 'the morning Star' by reason of the light that is going to dawn from Himself upon the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem; for by 'Star' is signified the Light from Himself which in its essence is Wisdom and Intelligence, and by the 'morning' or 'morn' is signified His coming, and a New Church then, as may be seen above (<a href="151.htm">151</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 954</h4><p>954. I am the Root and Offspring of David, the bright and morning Star, signifies that it is the Lord Himself who was born in the world, and was then the Light, and who will come with new light, which will arise before His New Church, which is the holy Jerusalem. "I am the Root and Offspring of David," signifies that He is the very Lord Himself who was born in the world, thus the Lord in His Divine Human; from this He is called "the Root and Offspring of David," and also "the Branch of David" (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15</a>), also "the Rod out of the stem of Jesse, and the Branch from his roots" (<a href="3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">Isaiah 11:1-2</a>). "The bright and morning Star," signifies that then there was light, and that He will come with new light, which will arise before His New Church, which is the holy Jerusalem. He is called "the bright Star" from the light with which He came into the world, wherefore He is likewise called "Star," and also "Light;" "a Star" (<a href="3927/numbers_24_17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>), and "Light" (<a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">John 1:4-12</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_19.htm">3:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="3927/john_9_5.htm">9:5</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">12:35-36</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_4_16.htm">Matthew 4:16</a>; <a href="3927/luke_2_30.htm">Luke 2:30-32</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_9_2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_49_6.htm">49:6</a>). And He is called "the morning Star" from the light which will rise before the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, from Him; for by "Star" is signified light from Him, which in its essence is wisdom and intelligence, and by "morning" is signified His coming, and then the New Church, as may be seen above, (<a href="151.htm">151</a>[1-3]). </p>
