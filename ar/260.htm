<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第260节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>260.“在天上、地上、地下、没有人能”表无论在高层天堂，还是在低层天堂，没有人能。“在天上、地上、地下”表示在高层天堂和低层天堂，13节中的也一样，在那里，经上说：</p><p>我又听见在天上、地上、地底下和洋海里一切被造之物，以及天地间的万有，都说，但愿祝福、尊贵、荣耀、权能都归给坐宝座的和羔羊，世世无穷。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.13.htm">5:13</a>）</p><p>由于约翰听见后者和前者说话，故显而易见，他们是天使和灵人在说话。因为约翰在灵里，如他自己在前一章（｛4:2）所说的。在灵里，他看见的是灵界的地。因为灵界也有地，和自然界一样。这一点从《天堂与地狱》，以及《最后的审判续》（<a href="../clj/32.htm">32</a>-38节）关于灵界的描述明显看出来。在灵界，高层天堂看似在大山和小山上，低层天堂看似在山下的地上，最末了的天堂好像在地下。因为诸天堂都是辽阔区域，一个在另一个之上，每个辽阔区域都像住在那里之人的脚下之地。最高的辽阔区域就像山顶，下一个辽阔区域在它底下，但向四面八方延伸得更宽广，最低的辽阔区域伸展还要宽广。由于这最低的辽阔区域在另一个底下，所以住在那里的人“在地下”。在高层天堂的天使看来，三层天堂就是这样分布的，因为在他们看来，那两层天堂在他们下面。它们同样如此呈现给约翰，因为他与他们在一起，他已经升到他们那里。这一点从前一章（｛4:1）明显看出来，在那里，经上说：</p><p>你上到这里来，我要将以后必成的事指示你。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.1.htm">4:1</a>）</p><p>人若对灵界和灵界的大地一无所知，绝无可能明白圣言所说“在地下”或“地的深处”是什么意思，如以赛亚书：</p><p>诸天哪，应当歌唱；地的深处啊，应当欢呼；众山应当发声歌唱，因为耶和华救赎了雅各。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.23.htm">44:23</a>等）</p><p>谁看不出，这里所说的是灵界的地？因为在自然界，没有人住在地底下。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 260</h4><p>260. And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able. This symbolically means that no one in the higher heavens or in the lower heavens [had the power].<p>In heaven, on the earth, and under the earth mean in the higher and lower heavens, as also below in verse <a href="3927/revelation_5_13.htm">13</a>, where these words occur:<p>And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying... [<a href="3927/revelation_5_13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a>]<p>Because John heard them all speaking, it is apparent that the speakers were angels and spirits, inasmuch as John was in the spirit, as he himself says in the preceding chapter (<a href="3927/revelation_4_2.htm">4:2</a>), and when he was in that state the only earth that appeared to him was that of the spiritual world. For there are lands there as in the natural world, as can be seen from the description of that world in the book Heaven and Hell, and in The Last Judgment (Supplement) <a href="../clj/32.htm">32-38</a>.<p>The higher heavens in the spiritual world appear on mountains and hills, the lower heavens on lands below, and the lowest heavens as though underground. For the heavens are expanses, one above another, and each expanse is as ground beneath the feet of its inhabitants. The highest expanse is like a mountaintop, with the second expanse below it, but one spreading more broadly all around, with the lowest expanse being still more broadly spread. And because the last exists below the second, its inhabitants are those who are below ground.<p>The three heavens also so appear to angels in the higher heavens, because to them there are two heavens below them. To John they appeared likewise, therefore, for he was in the presence of those higher angels, having ascended to them, as is apparent from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_4_1.htm">4:1</a>, where he is told, "Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this."<p>Someone who knows nothing of the spiritual world and the lands there cannot possibly know what "under the earth" means, or by the same token what the lower parts of the earth in the Word mean, as in Isaiah,<p>Sing, O heavens...! Exult, you lower parts of the earth; ring with singing, you mountains...! For Jehovah has redeemed Jacob... (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>)<p>And so elsewhere.<p>Who does not see that the lands of the spiritual world are meant there? For no one lives underground in the natural world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 260</h4><p>260. [verse 3] 'And no one in heaven, nor upon the land nor yet under the land' signifies that none in the higher heavens and in the lower heavens was able. By 'in heaven, upon the land, and under the land' is understood in the higher and lower heavens, as also below (verse 13) where there are these [words]:<p>And every created thing that is in heaven, in the land, and under the hand, and such as are in the sea, and all [that are] in them, heard I saying.<p>Since he heard all those (hos et illos) 'saying,' it is plain that they were angels and spirits who were speaking. Indeed John was in the spirit, as he himself says in the preceding chapter (<a href="3927/revelation_4_2.htm">4:2</a>), and in this state no land appeared to him other than the land of the spiritual world; for there are lands there just as in the natural world, as can be established from the description of that world in the work Concerning HEAVEN AND HELL, as well as in the CONTINUATION [CONCERNING THE LAST JUDGMENT AND] CONCERNING THE SPIRITUAL WORLD (<a href="../clj/32.htm">32-38</a>). There, the higher heavens appear upon mountains and hills, the lower heavens upon the lands below, and the ultimate heavens as it were under the lands; for the heavens are expanses, one above the other, and each expanse is as the land under the feet of those who are there. The highest expanse is like a mountain top; the next expanse is below it, but extending itself more widely on all sides round about; while the lowest expanse extends itself still more widely, and because this is below that [middle expanse], those there are 'under the land.' The three heavens also appear in this manner to the angels who are in the higher heavens, because to them two [heavens] appear below them. They therefore appeared in like manner to John, since he was with them, for he had gone up to them, as is plain from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_4_1.htm">4</a>, where it is said, 'Come up hither, and I will show thee the things which must come to pass hereafter.' He who knows nothing about the spiritual world and the lands there is quite unable to know what is understood by 'under the land,' likewise by 'lower lands' in the Word, as in Isaiah:<p>Sing, O heavens; shout for joy, O lower lands; resound with a song, O mountains; for Jehovah has redeemed Jacob. <a href="3927/isaiah_44_23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>; and elsewhere. Who does not see that the lands of the spiritual world are understood there, for no one dwells under the lands in the natural world? </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 260</h4><p>260. Verse 3. And no one in heaven, nor on earth, neither under the earth, was able, signifies that no one in the higher heavens or the lower heavens was able. "In heaven, on earth, and under the earth," mean in the higher and in the lower heavens, in like manner as in the 13th verse, where it is said:<p>And every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, (<a href="3927/revelation_5_13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a>).<p>Since he heard the latter and the former saying, it is evident that they were angels and spirits who spoke; for John was in the spirit, as he himself says in the preceding chapter, (<a href="3927/revelation_4_2.htm">Revelation 4:2</a>), in which state no other earth appeared to him than the earth of the spiritual world; for there are earths there as well as in the natural world, as may appear from the description of that world in the work concerning Heaven and Hell; as also in The Continuation concerning the Spiritual World, (<a href="32.htm">32-38</a>). The higher heavens appear there upon mountains and hills, the lower heavens in the earth beneath, and the ultimate heavens as it were under the earth. For the heavens are expanses one above another, and each expanse is like the earth under the feet of those who are there. The highest expanse is like the top of a mountain, the next expanse is under it, but extending itself more widely on all sides round about, and the lowest expanse more widely still; and since this last is under the other, they who are there are "under the earth." The three heavens also appear thus to the angels who are in the higher heavens, because to them there appear two heavens beneath them; therefore in like manner they appeared to John, because he was with them, for he had ascended to them, as is evident from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_4_1.htm">4</a>, where it is said:<p>Come up hither, and I will show thee things which must be hereafter, (<a href="3927/revelation_4_1.htm">4:1</a>).<p>He who does not know anything of the spiritual world and the earths there, can by no means know what is meant by "under the earth," nor by "the lower parts of the earth," in the Word, as in Isaiah:<p>Sing, O heavens, shout, ye lower parts of the earth, resound with singing, ye mountains, for Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a> and other places).<p>Who does not see that the earths of the spiritual world are here meant? for no man lives under the earth in the natural world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 260 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>260. (Vers. 3) "Et nemo potuit in Caelo, nec super terra, neque sub terra," significat quod nullus in Caelis superioribus et in Caelis inferioribus. - Per "in Caelo, super terra, et sub terra," intelligitur in Caelis superioribus et inferioribus, ut quoque infra (vers. 13), ubi haec: <p>"Et omne creatum, quod est in Caelo, in terra, et sub terra, et in mari quae sunt, et in illis omnia, audivi dicentes. <p>Quia audivit hos et illos dicentes, patet quod fuerint angeli et spiritus qui loquebantur; fuit etiam Johannes in spiritu, ut ipse in praecedente capite (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_260/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_4_2" target=_top>4:2</a>) dicit, in quo statu non alia terra illi apparuit, quam terra mundi spiritualis; sunt enim ibi terrae sicut in mundo naturali, ut constare potest ex descriptione illius mundi in Opere de Caelo et Inferno; tum in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_260/swedenborg_continuatio-de-ultimo-judicio_32" target=_top>Continuatione de Mundo Spirituali 32-38</a>. Caeli superiores ibi apparent super montibus et collibus, Caeli inferiores super terris infra, et Caeli ultimi quasi sub terris; Caeli enim sunt expansa, unum supra alterum, et quodvis expansum est sicut terra sub pedibus illorum qui ibi sunt; supremum expansum est sicut caput montis, alterum expansum est sub illo, sed latius ad latera circum circa se extendens, ac infimum expansum adhuc latius, et quia hoc est sub illo; sunt ibi illi qui "sub terra;" tres Caeli etiam ita apparent angelis qui in superioribus Caelis sunt, quia illis duo apparent infra illos; similiter itaque Johanni, quia apud illos erat, nam ad illos ascenderat, ut patet a capite <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_260/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_4_1" target=_top>4:1</a>, ubi dicitur, <p>"Ascende huc, et ostendam tibi quae oportet fieri post hac." <p>Qui non scit aliquid de mundo spirituali et de terris ibi, nequaquam scire potest quid intelligitur per "sub terra," similiter quid per "inferiora terrae," in Verbo, ut apud Esajam: <p>"Cantate Caeli, jubilate Inferiora terrae, personate Montes cantu, quia redemit Jehovah Jacobum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_260/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_44_23" target=_top>44:23</a>); et alibi. <p>Quis non videt, quod terrae mundi spiritualis ibi intelligantur; non enim aliquis homo sub terris in mundo naturali habitat. </p>
