<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第229节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>229.“见有一个宝座安置在天上”表代表形式的审判。“宝座”表天堂（参看<a href="14.htm">14</a>节）；宝座也表审判，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>当人子在祂荣耀里，同所有圣天使来临的时候，要坐在祂荣耀的宝座上。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.31.htm">25:31</a>等）</p><p>以下论述的是最后的审判：</p><p>耶和华啊，你已经为我伸冤，你坐在宝座上，按公义审判。耶和华要为审判预备宝座。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗 9.4.htm"> 9:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗 9.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗 9.7.htm">7</a>）</p><p>我见亘古常在者坐着；祂的宝座乃火焰；事奉他的有千千，，在祂面前侍立的有万万，要行审判，案卷都展开了。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.9.htm">7:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>耶路撒冷被建造；众支派上那里去；在那里设立审判的宝座。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗122.3.htm">122:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗122.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p>我又看见几个宝座，也有坐在上面的，并有审判的权柄赐给他们。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.4.htm">20:4</a>）</p><p>所罗门建造的“宝座”（列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上10.18.htm">10:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上10.20.htm">20</a>）既表王国，也表审判。因为王在执行审判时，便坐在宝座上。前面之所以说“宝座”表代表形式的审判，是因为约翰所看到的事物都是能代表的异象。它们看上去和他所描述的一样；但它们都是未来事物的代表形式；这一点从下文明显看出来，如他所看见的活物、龙、兽、圣殿、会幕、约柜，以及许多其它事物。先知所看到的事物也一样，如前所述（<a href="36.htm">36</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 229</h4><p>229. And behold, a throne set in heaven. This symbolizes the Judgment in a representative image.<p>It may be seen in no. <a href="14.htm">14</a> that a throne symbolizes heaven. That a throne also symbolizes judgment is apparent from the following passages:<p>When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory. (<a href="3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>ff.)<p>The subject there is the Last Judgment.<p>...You [Jehovah] have executed my judgment...; You sat on the throne as a righteous judge... Jehovah... will prepare His throne for judgment. (<a href="3927/psalms_9_4.htm">Psalms 9:4-5</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_9_7.htm">7</a>)<p>I watched (when)...the Ancient of Days was seated..., His throne (like) a fiery flame... A thousand thousands ministered to Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. He sat in judgment, and the books were opened. (<a href="3927/daniel_7_9.htm">Daniel 7:9-10</a>)<p>Jerusalem is built...; to it the tribes go up... ...thrones are set there for judgment... (<a href="3927/psalms_122_3.htm">Psalms 122:3-5</a>)<p>I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was turned over to them. (<a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>)<p>The throne that Solomon made, as described in <a href="3927/1-kings_10_18.htm">1 Kings 10:18-20</a>, symbolized both royal authority and judgment, since kings sat upon thrones when they pronounced judgments.<p>We say that the throne symbolizes the Judgment in a representative image, because the things that John saw were representative visions. He saw them as he described them, but they were images representative of future events, as can be seen from the descriptions that follow, such as his seeing living creatures, a dragon, beasts, a temple, a tabernacle, an ark, and many other things.<p>Similar images were seen by the prophets, as noted in no. <a href="36.htm">36</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 229</h4><p>229. 'And behold a throne set [in heaven]' signifies judgment in a representative form. That a 'throne' signifies heaven may be seen (<a href="14.htm">14</a>). That a 'throne' also signifies judgment is plain from these passages:<p>When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He shall sit upon the throne of His glory. <a href="3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a> seq.<p>It treats there of the last judgment.<p>O Jehovah, Thou hast made my judgment, Thou hast sat upon the throne, a Judge of justice. Jehovah will prepare His throne for judgment. <a href="3927/psalms_9_4.htm">Psalms 9:4-5</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_9_7.htm">7</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_9_5.htm">5-6</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_9_8.htm">8</a>].<p>I saw when the Ancient of days did sit, His throne as a flame of fire; a thousand and thousands were ministering to Him, and a myriad of myriads were standing before Him: the judgment was in session, and the books were opened. <a href="3927/daniel_7_9.htm">Daniel 7:9-10</a>.<p>Jerusalem has been built, thither the tribes go up, and there thrones are set for judgment. <a href="3927/psalms_122_3.htm">Psalms 122:3</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_122_5.htm">5</a>.<p>I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them. <a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>.<p>The throne built by Solomon (<a href="3927/1-kings_10_18.htm">1 Kings 10:18-20</a>) used to signify both royalty and judgment, since the kings, when they gave judgments, used to sit upon thrones. It is said that a 'throne' signifies judgment in a representative form, because the things that John saw were visions that were representing. They were seen as he has described, but they were forms representative of future things, as can be established from the things following, as that animals, the dragon, beasts, the temple, the tabernacle, the ark, and other things besides, were seen. The things that were seen by the prophets were similar, of which above (<a href="36.htm">36</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 229</h4><p>229. And, behold, a throne was set, signifies a representation of the Judgment. That "a throne" signifies heaven may be seen, (<a href="14.htm">14</a>); that a throne also signifies judgment, is evident from the following passages:<p>When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory, (<a href="3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>.<p>The Last Judgment is here treated of:<p>O Jehovah, Thou hast done my judgment, Thou sattest upon the throne a Judge of justice. Jehovah will prepare His throne for judgment, (<a href="3927/psalms_9_4.htm">Psalms 9:4-5</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_9_7.htm">7</a>).<p>I saw when the Ancient of Days did sit; His throne was as a flame of fire; a thousand and thousands ministered unto Him, and a myriad of myriads stood before Him, the judgment was set and the books were opened, (<a href="3927/daniel_7_9.htm">Daniel 7:9-10</a>).<p>Jerusalem is built; thither the tribes go up; and there are set thrones for judgment, (<a href="3927/psalms_122_3.htm">Psalms 122:3-5</a>).<p>I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them, (<a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>).<p>"The throne" built by Solomon, mentioned, (<a href="3927/1-kings_10_18.htm">1 Kings 10:18-20</a>) signifies both kingdom and judgment; since kings, when they executed judgment, sat upon thrones. It is said that "the throne" signifies judgment in a representative form, because the things which John saw were visions which represented. They were seen as he has described; but they were forms representative of future things, as may be evident from what follows; as that there were seen animals, a dragon, beasts, a temple, a tabernacle, the ark, and many other things. Similar were the things which were seen by the prophets, spoken of above, (<a href="36.htm">36</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 229 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>229. "Et ecce Thronus positus," significat Judicium in forma repraesentativa. - Quod "thronus" significet Caelum videatur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_229/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_14" target=_top>14</a>); quod "thronus" etiam significet Judicium, patet ex his locis: <p>"Quando venerit Filius Hominis in gloria Sua, et omnes sancti Angeli cum Ipso, tunc sedebit super Throno gloriae Suae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_229/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_25_31" target=_top>Matthaeus 25:31</a>, seq.);<p>agitur ibi de Ultimo Judicio. <p>Jehovah "fecisti judicium meum, sedisti super Throno Judex justitiae.

Dicitur quod "thronus" significet Judicium in forma representativa, quia illa, quae Johannes vidit, erant Visiones quae representabant; visa sunt sicut descripsit, sed erant formae representativae futurorum, ut constare potest ex sequentibus, ut quod visa sint Animalia, Draco, Bestiae, Templum, Tabernaculum, Arca, et plura alia: similia fuerunt quae visa sunt Prophetis, de quibus supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_229/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_36" target=_top>36</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;vii. pro "ix." </p>
