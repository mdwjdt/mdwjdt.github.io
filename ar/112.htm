<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第112节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>112.“甚至在我忠心的殉道者安提帕在你们中间、撒但所住的地方被杀的日子”表当一切真理被教会中的虚假灭绝的时候。“殉道者”表示真理的告白，与“见证人”所表相同（<a href="6.htm">6</a>，<a href="16.htm">16</a>节），因为在希腊语，“殉道者”和“见证人”是一个字。“安提帕”之名取自属灵的语言，或天使的语言。由于“殉道者安提帕”表示真理的告白者，抽象而言，表示真理本身，故很明显，“甚至在我忠心的殉道者安提帕在你们中间、撒但所住的地方被杀的日子”表当真理被教会中的虚假灭绝的时候。“撒但”表示虚假所在并所来自的地狱（参看<a href="97.htm">97</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 112</h4><p>112. "'Even in the days in which Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.'" This symbolically means, at a time when all truth has been extinguished by falsities in the church.<p>A martyr symbolizes a confessor of truth, having the same meaning as a witness (nos. <a href="6.htm">6</a> and <a href="16.htm">16</a> above), because "martyr" and "witness" in Greek are the same word. The name Antipas comes from the spiritual or angelic language.<p>Since the martyr Antipas symbolizes a confessor of truth, and abstractly truth itself, it is apparent that "in the days in which Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells," means symbolically, at a time when all truth has been extinguished by falsities in the church.<p>That Satan means a hell where falsities exist and from where they emanate, see no. <a href="97.htm">97</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 112</h4><p>112. 'Even in the days in which Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was slain among you where Satan dwells' signifies when all the truth (veritas) has been extinguished by means of the untruths in the Church. By a 'martyr' is signified confession of the truth (veritas), the same as is signified by a 'witness' (<a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="16.htm">16</a>), because 'martyr' and 'witness' in the Greek language are one word. It is from spiritual or angelic language that 'Antipas' is named. Since by 'Antipas the martyr' is signified a confessor of the truth (veritas), and abstractly the truth (veritas) itself, it is plain that by 'In the days in which Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was slain among you where Satan dwells' is signified when the truth (veritas) has been extinguished by means of the untruths in the Church. That by 'Satan' is understood the hell where and whence untruths are may be seen above (<a href="97.htm">97</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 112</h4><p>112. Even in those days wherein Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth, signifies when all truth was extinguished by falsities in the church. By "martyr" is signified confession of the truth, the same as by "a witness" (above, <a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="16.htm">16</a>), because "martyr" and "witness" are expressed in the Greek language by one expression. "Antipas" is named from the spiritual or angelic language. Since by "Antipas the martyr" is signified a confessor of the truth, and, abstractly, the truth itself, it is evident that, by "in the days wherein Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth," is signified, when truth was extinguished by falsities in the church. That by "Satan" is meant the hell where and from whence falsities are, may be seen above, (<a href="97.htm">97</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 112 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>112. "Et in diebus in quibus Antipas martyr Meus fidelis; qui occisus apud vos ubi habitat satanas," significat quando omnis veritas per falsa in Ecclesia exstincta est. - Per "martyrem" significatur confessio veritatis, simile quod per "testem" (supra <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_112/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6" target=_top>6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_112/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_16" target=_top>16</a>), quia "martyr" et "testis" in Lingua Graeca una vox sunt: quod nominetur "Antipas" est ex lingua spirituali seu angelica. Quoniam per "Antipatem martyrem" significatur confessor veritatis, et abstracte ipsa veritas, patet quod per "In diebus in quibus Antipas martyr Meus fidelis, qui occisus apud vos ubi habitat satanas" significetur quando veritas per falsa in Ecclesia exstincta est. Quod per "satanam" intelligatur Infernum ubi et unde falsa, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_112/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_97" target=_top>97</a>). </p>
