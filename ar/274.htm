<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第274节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>274.“他既拿了书卷”表当主决定施行审判，由此将天上地上的一切事物恢复秩序时。如前所述，“拿了书卷”并展开表示审查所有人的生命状态，并照其状态审判各人。故此处主“拿了书卷”表示主决定施行最后的审判。施行最后审判的目的，是将天上的一切事物都恢复秩序，并藉由天堂将地上的一切事物恢复秩序。因此，“拿了书卷”也表示这一点。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 274</h4><p>274. Now when He had taken the book. (<a href="3927/revelation_5_8.htm">5:8</a>) This symbolically means, when the Lord prepared to execute judgment, and thereby put back into order everything in heaven and on earth.<p>To take the book and open it. This symbolically means to explore the states of life of all people and to judge each one according to his state, as we said before. Consequently His having taken the book here means, symbolically, to have the intention to execute a last judgment. And because He executed a last judgment in order to put back into order everything in heaven, and through heaven on earth, this too is symbolically meant. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 274</h4><p>274. [verse 8] 'And when He had taken the book' signifies when the Lord set about making the judgment, and bringing all things in the heavens and upon earth back into order by means of it. By 'to take' the book and 'to open it' is signified to examine the states of life of all, and to judge each one in accordance with his own [state], as above. Here, therefore, by [the statement] that 'he had taken the book' is signified to have the intention of making the last judgment, and because a last judgment is brought about so that all things may be brought back into order in the heavens, and on earth by means of the heavens, this also is signified. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 274</h4><p>274. Verse 8. And when He had taken the book, signifies when the Lord decided to execute the judgment, and thereby to reduce all things in the heavens and in the earths to order. By "taking the book" and opening it, is signified to explore the states of life of all, and to judge everyone according to his state, as above. Therefore here by "His taking the book," is signified His decision to execute the Last Judgment; and as the Last Judgment is executed for the purpose of reducing all things to order in the heavens, and through the heavens, in the earths, this also is signified. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 274 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>274. (Vers. 8) "Et cum accepisset Librum" significat quando Dominus instituit judicium facere, et per id omnia in Caelis et super terris redigere in ordinem. - Ver "recipere librum" et aperire illum, significatur explorare status vitae omnium, et judicare unumquemvis secundum suum, ut supra; hic itaque per quod "accepisset librum" significatur in instituto habere Ultimum Judicium facere; et quia Ultimum Judicium fit, ut omnia in ordinem redigantur in Caelis, et per Caelos in terris, etiam hoc significatur. </p>
