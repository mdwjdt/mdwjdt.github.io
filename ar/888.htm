<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第888节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>888.“我是阿拉法和俄梅戛；是初和终”表叫他们知道，主是天地之神，天上和地上的一切事物都是祂所造的，由祂的圣治掌管并照圣治成就。主是“阿拉法是阿拉法和俄梅戛；是初和终”，由此意味着一切事物都是祂所造的，并由祂掌管并成就，详情可参看前文（<a href="13.htm">13</a>，<a href="29.htm">29</a>-31，<a href="38.htm">38</a>，<a href="57.htm">57</a>，<a href="92.htm">92</a>节）。主是天地之神，这一点从祂在约翰福音中的话明显看出来：</p><p>赐给祂权柄管理凡有血气的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.2.htm">17:2</a>）</p><p>马太福音：</p><p>天上地上所有的权柄都赐给我了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">28:18</a>）</p><p>凡被造的，都是藉着祂造的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">1:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）</p><p>显而易见，由祂所造或创造的一切事物都由祂的圣治来掌管。</p>

This symbolically means that the people addressed may know that the Lord is God of heaven and earth, and that He formed everything in the heavens and on earth, and governs all things by His Divine providence and directs them in accordance with it.<p>That the Lord is the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, and that this means that He formed all things and governs and directs them, and more, may be seen in nos. <a href="13.htm">13</a>, <a href="29.htm">29-31</a>, <a href="38.htm">38</a>, <a href="57.htm">57</a>, <a href="92.htm">92</a> above.<p>That the Lord is God of heaven and earth is clear from His words in John:<p>...given Him (is) authority over all flesh. (<a href="3927/john_17_2.htm">John 17:2</a>)<p>And in Matthew:<p>All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>)<p>And that by Him were all things made that were made (<a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">John 1:3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>).<p>Plainly, everything made or created by Him is governed by His Divine providence. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 888</h4><p>888. 'I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the Ending' signifies so that they might know that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that all things in the heavens and on earth (in terris) were made by Him, and are governed by His Divine Providence, and are done in accordance therewith. That the Lord is 'Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the Ending,' and that by this is understood that by Him all things were made, are governed and done, and more, may be seen above (<a href="13.htm">13</a>, <a href="29.htm">29-31</a>, <a href="38.htm">38</a>, <a href="57.htm">57</a>, <a href="92.htm">92</a>). That the Lord is the God of heaven and earth is established from His words in John:<p>Authority has been given to Me over all flesh. <a href="3927/john_17_2.htm">John 17:2</a>; and in Matthew:<p>All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. <a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>; and:<p>That by Him all things have been made that are made. <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">John 1:3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>.<p>That all the things that have been made or created by Him are governed by His Providence, is plain. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 888</h4><p>888. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, signifies that they may know that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that all things in the heavens and earths were made by Him, and are governed by His Divine Providence, and are done according to it. That the Lord is "the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End" and that thereby is meant that by Him all things were made, and are governed and done, and more may be seen above, (<a href="13.htm">13</a>, <a href="29.htm">29-31</a>, <a href="38.htm">38</a>, <a href="57.htm">57</a>, <a href="92.htm">92</a>). That the Lord is the God of heaven and earth is evident from His words in John:<p>Power is given to Me over all flesh, (<a href="3927/john_17_2.htm">17:2</a>).<p>And in Matthew:<p>All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth, (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">28:18</a>);<p>And that all things were made by Him, that were made, (<a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">1:3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>).<p>That all things which were made or created by Him, are governed by His Divine Providence is evident. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 888 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>888. "Ego sum Alpha at Omega, Principium et Finis," significat ut sciant, quod Dominus sit Deus Caeli et Terrae, et quod ad Ipso omnia in Caelis et in Terris facta sint, ac per Divinam Ipsius Providentiam regantur, et secundum illam fiant. -Quod Dominus sit "Alpha et Omega, Principium et Finis," et quod per id intelligatur, quod ab Ipso omnia facta sint, regantur et fiant, et plura, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_888/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_13" target=_top>13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_888/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_29" target=_top>29-31</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_888/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_38" target=_top>38</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_888/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_57" target=_top>57</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_888/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_92" target=_top>92</a>). Quod Dominus sit Deus Caeli et Terrae constat ex Ipsius verbis apud Johannem: <p>Data est Mihi "potestas omnis carnis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_888/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_17_2" target=_top>17:2</a>);<p>et apud Matthaeum: <p>"Data est Mihi omnis potestas in Caelo et in Terra," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_888/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_28_18" target=_top>28:18</a>);<p>Et quod ab Ipso omnia facta sint quae facta, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_888/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_3" target=_top>Johannes 1:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_888/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_14" target=_top>14</a>).<p>Quod omnia quae ab Ipso facta seu creata sunt, per Divinam Ipsius Providentiam regantur, patet. </p>
