<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第946节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>946.启22:9.“他对我说，千万不可！我与你和你的弟兄众先知，并那些守这书上言语的人，同是作仆人的。你要敬拜神”表不可敬拜和祈求天上的天使，因为神性之物丝毫不属于他们；但他们与那些处于新耶路撒冷的教义并遵行其诫命的世人如弟兄与弟兄那样相联系；在与他们交往时要单单敬拜主。该天使在此对约翰所说的话和他前面对约翰所说的（｛19:10）几乎所表相同，那里有这些话：“我就俯伏在他（天使）脚前要拜他。他对我说，千万不可！我和你，并你那些为耶稣作见证的弟兄同是作仆人的。你要敬拜神。” 这些话所表相同（参看<a href="818.htm">818</a>节），不同之处在于，现在经上说“我与你和你的弟兄众先知，并那些守这书上言语的人，同是作仆人的”，“弟兄众先知”表示那些处于新耶路撒冷教义的人，“那些守这书上言语的人”表示那些遵守并行出如今被主显明的该教义的诫命之人（参看<a href="944.htm">944</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 946</h4><p>946. <a href="3927/revelation_22_9.htm">22:9</a> Then he said to me, "See that you do not do that. For I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Worship God." This symbolically means that angels in heaven are not to be worshiped or invoked, because they have nothing Divine in them, but are affiliated as brethren with brethren with people who have the doctrine of the New Jerusalem and obey its commandments, and the Lord alone is to be worshiped in fellowship with them.<p>What the angel says here to John has almost the same symbolic meaning as what he said to him in chapter 19 above, where we were told the following:<p>And I fell at the feet (of the angel) to worship him, but he said to me, "See that you do not this! I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God!" (<a href="3927/revelation_19_10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>)<p>That this has the same symbolic meaning may be seen in no. <a href="818.htm">818</a> above, the only difference being that the angel now says that he is "the fellow servant of your brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book;" and John's brethren the prophets symbolize people who have the doctrine of the New Jerusalem, and those who keep the words of this book symbolize people who keep and obey the precepts of that doctrine, which the Lord has now revealed, as may be seen in no. <a href="944.htm">944</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 946</h4><p>946. [verse 9] 'And he says unto me, See thou do it not, for I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brothers the prophets, and of those keeping the words of this book; adore God' signifies that the angels of heaven are not to be adored and invoked because nothing Divine belongs to them, but that they are associated as brothers with brothers with the men who are in the doctrine of the New Jerusalem and do its precepts, and that in fellowship with them the Only Lord is to be adored. By these things that the angel here spoke with John nearly the same things are signified as those spoken with him above (chapter xix) where are these words:<p>And I fell down before the feet of the angel to adore him, and he said unto me, See thou do it not, I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brothers having the testimony of Jesus; adore God (verse 10).<p>That such things are signified by these words may be seen above (<a href="818.htm">818</a>), with the difference that now it is said 'fellow-servant of thy brothers the prophets and of those keeping the words of this book'; and by 'brothers the prophets' are signified those who are in the doctrine of the New Jerusalem, and by 'those keeping the words of this book' are signified those who protect and do the precepts of that doctrine, which has now been made manifest by the Lord, as may be seen above (<a href="944.htm">944</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 946</h4><p>946. Verse 9. And he saith unto me, See thou do it not; for I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them that keep the words of this book; adore God, signifies that the angels of heaven are not to be adored and invoked, because nothing Divine belongs to them, but that they are associated with men as brethren with brethren, with those who are in the doctrine of the New Jerusalem, and do its precepts, and that the Lord alone is to be adored in consociation with them. By what the angel here speaks with John, nearly the same is signified as by what he spoke to him above (Revelation 19), where are these things: "And I fell down before the angel's feet to adore him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not; I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus; adore God" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_22_10.htm">10</a>). That the like is signified by these words may be seen above, (<a href="818.htm">818</a>), with this difference, that it is now said, "the fellow-servant of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the words of this book;" and by "brethren the prophets" are signified they who are in the doctrine of the New Jerusalem, and by "them which keep the words of this book," are signified they who observe and do the precepts of that doctrine, which are now manifested by the Lord, see above, (<a href="944.htm">944</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 946 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>946. (Vers. 9.) "Et dicit mihi, Vide ne; conservus tuus enim sum, et fratrum tuorum Prophetarum, et servantium verba Libri hujus; Deum adorandi significat quod Angeli Caeli non adorandi et invocandi sint, quia nihil Divinum est illis, sed Quod associati sint hominibus sicut fratres fratribus, illis qui in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae sunt, et faciunt praecepta ejus, et quod Solus Dominus in consociatione cum illis adorandus sit. - Per haec, quae Angelus hic loquitur cum Johanne, paene similia significantur quae locutus est cum illo supra (capite <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_946/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_19_1-21" target=_top>19</a>), ubi haec: <p>"Et procidi ante pedes Angeli adorare illum; et dixit mihi, Vide ne; conservus tuus sum, et fratrum tuorum habentium testimonium Jesu; Deum adora," (vers. 10);<p>per quae quod talia significentur, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_946/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_818" target=_top>818</a>); cum differentia, quod nunc dicatur "conservus fratrum tuorum Prophetarum, et servantium verba Libri hujus;" et per "fratres Prophetas" significantur qui in doctrina Novae Hierosolymae sunt, et per "servantes verba Libri hujus" significantur qui custodiunt et faciunt praecepta illius doctrinae, quae nunc, a Domino manifestata sunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_946/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_944" target=_top>944</a>). </p>
