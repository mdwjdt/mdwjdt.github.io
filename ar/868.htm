<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第868节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>868.“死了的人都凭着这些案卷所记载的，照他们所行的受审判”表所有人都照其外在里面的内在生命受审判。“死了的人”表示所有从地上死亡，然后在灵人界的人（<a href="866.htm">866</a>节）。“都凭着这些案卷所记载的”表示出于那时每个人所敞开的心智内层，如前所述（<a href="867.htm">867</a>节）；“照他们所行的”表示每个人外在里面的内在在生命。在圣言中，“所行的”（works或行为）就表示这一点（参看<a href="72.htm">72</a>，<a href="76.htm">76</a>，<a href="94.htm">94</a>，<a href="141.htm">141</a>，<a href="641.htm">641</a>节）；对此，我要进一步补充说明：既有心智的行为，也有身体的行为，它们二者同时是内在的，又是外在的。心智的行为是意图和努力，身体的行为是言语和行动；二者各自都从人的内在生命发出，而内在生命属于其意愿或爱。凡没有终结于行为的，无论是涉及心智的内在事物，还是涉及身体的外在事物，都不在人的生命中，因为它们虽从灵人界流入，却没有被接受，因而就像击打眼睛的图像，或像刺激鼻孔的气味，人会把脸别过去。关于该主题的详细内容可见于上述地方，那里通过从圣言引用的一些经文证明人照自己所行的受审判；对此，再从保罗书信中补充以下经文：</p><p>在神公义审判的义愤和显示的日子；祂必照各人的行为报应各人。（罗马书<a href="http://39-27.cn/罗2.5.htm">2:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/罗2.6.htm">6</a>）因为我们众人，必要在基督的审判台前显露出来，叫各人按着他所行的，或善或恶，受身体所作的事。（哥林多后书<a href="http://39-27.cn/林后5.10.htm">5:10</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 868</h4><p>868. And the dead were judged according to their works, in accordance with the things which were written in their books. This symbolically means that all were judged in accordance with the inner life within their outward appearances.<p>The dead symbolize all who had died from earthly lands and were then in the world of spirits, as in no. <a href="866.htm">866</a> above. In accordance with the things which were written in their books means, symbolically, in accordance with the interiors of each person's mind then revealed, as in no. <a href="867.htm">867</a> just above. According to their works means, symbolically, according to the inner life in each person's outward appearances. That this is the symbolic meaning of works in the Word may be seen in nos. <a href="72.htm">72</a>, <a href="76.htm">76</a>, <a href="94.htm">94</a>, <a href="141.htm">141</a>, <a href="641.htm">641</a> above, to which I add the following, that some works are works of the mind and some are works of the body, both of them internal and at the same time external. Works of the mind are intentions and endeavors, and works of the body are words and actions. Both spring from a person's inner life, which is the life of his will and love. Whatever does not terminate in works, either in the internal works of the mind or in the external works of the body, is not part of a person's life, for though it flows in from the world of spirits, it is not embraced. Such things are consequently like images that strike the eyes, or like odors that strike the nose, from which the person turns his head away.<p>But more on this subject may be seen in the numbers cited above, where some passages from the Word are also presented to confirm that a person is judged according to his works. In addition to those passages are these as well from Paul:<p>...in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will render to each one according to his works. (<a href="3927/romans_2_5.htm">Romans 2:5-6</a>)<p>...we must all appear before the tribunal of the Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or evil. (<a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 868</h4><p>868. 'And the dead were judged out of the things written in the books according to their works' signifies that they were all judged in accordance with their internal life in external things. By 'the dead' are signified all who died from on earth and were then in the world of spirits, as above (<a href="866.htm">866</a>). 'Out of the things written in the books' signifies out of the interior things of every one's mind then laid open, as just above (<a href="867.htm">867</a>). 'According to their works' signifies in accordance with every one's internal life in external things. That this is signified by 'works' in the Word may be seen above (<a href="72.htm">72</a>, <a href="76.htm">76</a>, <a href="94.htm">94</a>, <a href="141.htm">141</a>, <a href="641.htm">641</a>); to which I will add this, that there are works of the mind and works of the body, both of them at once internal and external. The works of the mind are intentions and endeavours, and the works of the body are utterances and actions. Both of these (haec et illa) proceed out of a man's internal life, which is of his will or love. Whatever does not terminate in works, whether it be internal things that are of the mind or external things that are of the body, these are not in the man's life, for they inflow out of the world of spirits but are not being received. Therefore they are like images that strike the eyes and like odours that impinge on the nostrils, from which the man turns away his face. But more things concerning these matters may be seen in the places cited above, where also some passages have been quoted out of the Word confirming that a man is judged in accordance with his works. Besides them there are also these [words] from Paul:<p>In the day of wrath and of the revelation of God's just judgment. Who will render to every one in accordance with his works, <a href="3927/romans_2_5.htm">Romans 2:5-6</a>.<p>We must all be exposed before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may obtain the things that he has done by means of the body, according to the things he has done, whether good or evil, <a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 868</h4><p>868. And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works, signifies that all were judged according to their internal life in externals. By "the dead" are signified all who died from the earth, and were then in the world of spirits, as above, (<a href="866.htm">866</a>). "Out of those things which were written in the books," signifies out of the interiors of everyone's mind then laid open, as above, (<a href="867.htm">867</a>); "according to their works," signifies, according to the internal life of everyone in externals. That this is signified by "works" in the Word, may be seen above, (<a href="72.htm">72</a>, <a href="76.htm">76</a>, <a href="94.htm">94</a>, <a href="141.htm">141</a>, <a href="641.htm">641</a>); to which I will further add, that there are works of the mind and works of the body, both of them at once internal and external. The works of the mind are intentions and endeavors, and the works of the body are words and actions; each of these proceed from the internal life of man, which is of his will or love. Whatsoever does not close in works, either internal which relate to the mind, or external which relate to the body, are not in the life of man, for they inflow from the world of spirits but are not received, therefore they are like images that strike the eyes, or as odors that affect the nostrils, from which a man turns away his face. But more may be seen on this subject in the places cited above, where also some passages are adduced from the Word to prove that man is judged according to his works; to which may be added the following from Paul:<p>In the day of anger and revelation of the just judgment of God; who will render to everyone according to his deeds, (<a href="3927/romans_2_5.htm">Romans 2:5-6</a>).<p>For we must all be manifested before the judgment-seat of Christ, that everyone may receive the things done in the body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or evil, (<a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 868 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>868. "Et judicati sunt mortui ex scriptis in libris secundum opera illorum," significat quod omnes judicati sint secundum vitam suam internam in externis. - Per "mortuos" significantur omnes qui e terris mortui sunt, et tunc in Mundo spirituum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_868/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_866" target=_top>866</a>); "ex scriptis in libris" significat ex interioribus mentis cujusvis tunc reclusis (ut mox supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_868/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_867" target=_top>867</a>); "secundum opera illorum" significat secundum vitam cujusvis internam in externis; quod id per "opera" in Verbo significetur, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_868/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_72" target=_top>72</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_868/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_76" target=_top>76</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_868/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_94" target=_top>94</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_868/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_141" target=_top>141</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_868/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_641" target=_top>641</a>); <sup>1</sup>quibus adjiciam haec, quod dentur opera mentis et opera corporis, utraque interna et simul externa; opera mentis sunt intentiones et conatus, et opera corporis sunt loquelae et actus; haec et illa procedunt ex hominis vita interna, quae est voluntatis seu amoris ejus; quicquid non desinit in opera, sive interna quae mentis sive externa quae corporis, non sunt in vita hominis, influunt enim e Mundo spirituum, sed non recipiuntur; quare sunt sicut imagines quae stringunt oculos, et sicut odores qui feriunt nares, a quibus homo avertit faciem: sed plura de his videantur in locis supra citatis, ubi etiam aliqua loca ex Verbo adducta sunt confirmantia quod homo secundum opera judicetur.
