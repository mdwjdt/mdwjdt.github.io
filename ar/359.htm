<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第359节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>359.启7:8.“西布伦支派中受印的有一万二千”表那些将要属于主的新天堂和新教会之人所具有的良善与真理的婚姻之爱。在至高意义上，“西布伦”表示主里面神性本身与神性人的结合；在属灵意义上，表示那些在天堂和教会中的人所具有良善与真理的婚姻；在属世意义上，表示婚姻之爱本身；故此处“西布伦”表示良善与真理的婚姻之爱；他还因“同住”而得名（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.19.htm">30:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.20.htm">20</a>）；“同住”论及心灵合而为一的已婚配偶，因为这样的结合就是属灵的同住。此处“西布伦”所表示的良善与真理的婚姻之爱就是主与教会的婚姻之爱。主是爱之良善本身，并恩准教会成为出于这良善的真理；当教会中人以真理接受来自主的良善时，“同住”就产生了。在这种情况下，良善与真理的婚姻就在人里面形成了，该婚姻便是教会本身，于是，他成为一个天堂。正因如此，在圣言中，神的国，也就是天堂和教会，经常被比作婚姻。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 359</h4><p>359. Of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand were sealed. (<a href="3927/revelation_7_8.htm">7:8</a>) This symbolizes the conjugal love of goodness and truth in those people who will be part of the New Heaven and of the Lord's New Church.<p>In the highest sense Zebulun symbolizes the union of the Divine itself and the Divine humanity in the Lord; in the spiritual sense, the marriage of goodness and truth in those people who are in heaven and in the church; and in the natural sense, married love itself. Thus Zebulun here symbolizes the conjugal love of goodness and truth. His name also comes from a word meaning cohabitation ([<a href="3927/genesis_30_19.htm">30:19-20</a>]), and cohabitation is a word used of married partners, whose minds are joined into one; for that conjunction is a spiritual cohabitation.<p>The conjugal love of goodness and truth that Zebulun symbolizes here is the conjugal love of the Lord and the church. For the Lord is love's goodness itself, and He grants that the church be the truth springing from that love; and a cohabitation results when the person of the church receives in truths goodness from the Lord. The person then has formed in him a marriage of goodness and truth, which is the essential church, and he becomes a heaven.<p>It is because of this that God's kingdom - which is to say, heaven and the church - is so often likened in the Word to a marriage. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 359</h4><p>359. [verse 8] 'Out of the tribe of Zebulon twelve thousand sealed' signifies the conjugial love of good and truth also with those who will belong to the New Heaven and the Lord's New Church. By 'Zebulon' in the highest sense is signified the Union of the Divine Itself and the Divine Human in the Lord, in the spiritual sense the marriage of good and truth with those who are in heaven and the Church, and in the natural sense conjugial love itself. Consequently by 'Zebulon' here is signified the conjugial love of good and truth, He was indeed named from cohabitation (<a href="3927/genesis_30_19.htm">Genesis 30:19-20</a>); and cohabitation is said of married partners whose minds have been conjoined into one, for that conjunction is a spiritual cohabitation. The conjugial love of good and truth, which is here signified by 'Zebulon,' is the conjugial love of the Lord and the Church. The Lord is the Good Itself of Love, and He grants that the Church may be the truth out of that good; and cohabitation comes about when the man of the Church receives good from the Lord in truths, whereupon with the man there is effected a marriage of good and truth, which is the Church itself, and he becomes a heaven, It is on this account that the kingdom of God, that is, heaven and the Church, is in the Word so many times compared to a marriage. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 359</h4><p>359. Verse 8. Of the tribe of Zebulon were sealed twelve thousand, signifies the conjugial love of good and truth also with those who will be of the Lord's New Heaven and New Church. By "Zebulon," in the highest sense, is signified the union of the Divine Itself and the Divine Human in the Lord; in the spiritual sense, the marriage of good and truth with those who are in heaven and in the church; and, in the natural sense, conjugial love itself; therefore here, by "Zebulon" is signified the conjugial love of good and truth; he was also named from "cohabitation" (<a href="3927/genesis_30_19.htm">Genesis 30:19</a>, <a href="3927/genesis_30_22.htm">22</a>); and cohabitation is predicated of married partners whose minds are joined into one, for such conjunction is spiritual cohabitation. The conjugial love of good and truth, which is here signified by "Zebulon," is the conjugial love of the Lord and the church. The Lord is the good of love itself, and gives to the church to be truth from that good; and cohabitation is effected, when the man of the church receives good from the Lord in truths. In this case the marriage of good and truth takes place with man, which is the church itself, and he becomes a heaven. Hence it is that the kingdom of God, that is, heaven and the church, is so often compared in the Word to a marriage. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 359 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>359. (Vers. 8.) "Ex tribu Sebulonis duodecim millia signati," significat Amorem conjugialem boni et veri, etiam apud illos qui e Novo Caelo et e Nova Ecclesia Domini erunt. - Per "Zebulonem" in supremo Sensu significatur Unio Ipsius Divini ac Divini Humani in Domino, in Sensu spirituali Conjugium boni et veri apud illos qui in Caelo et in Ecclesia sunt, et in Sensu naturali ipse Amor conjugialis; inde hic per "Sebulonem" significatur Amor conjugialis boni et veri; nominatus etiam est a Cohabitatione, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_359/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_30_19-20" target=_top>Genesis 30:19-20</a>); et cohabitatio dicitur de conjugibus, quorum mentes conjunctae sunt in unum, est enim illa conjunctio cohabitatio spiritualis. Amor conjugialis boni et veri, qui hic per "Sebulonem" significatur, est Amor conjugialis Domini et Ecclesiae; Dominus est ipsum Bonum Amoris, ac dat ut Ecclesia sit Verum ex illo Bono et Cohabitatio fit, cum homo Ecclesiae in Veris recipit Bonum a Domino; tunc fit apud hominem conjugium boni et veri, quod est ipsa Ecclesia, et fit Caelum: inde est quod Regnum Dei, hoc est, Caelum et Ecclesia, toties in Verbo comparetur Conjugio. </p>
