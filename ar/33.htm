<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第33节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>33.“在耶稣基督的患难、国度、忍耐期待里”表在教会中那些被邪恶与虚假侵扰的事物，但当主到来时，祂要除去这些邪恶与虚假。“患难”表教会不再存留仁之良善与信之真理，取而代之的是邪恶与虚假时的状态。“国度”表教会，“耶稣基督的忍耐期待”表主的到来。因此，这些话，即“在耶稣基督的患难、国度、忍耐期待里”合为一个意思就表示当教会的良善与真理被邪恶与虚假所侵扰时，主到来时必清除这些邪恶与虚假。“患难”表教会被邪恶与虚假所侵扰时的状态，这一点从以下经文明显可知：</p><p>在时代的末了，他们要把你们陷在患难里，也要杀害你们。因为那时必有大灾难，从世界的起头直到如今，没有这样的灾难，后来也必没有。那些日子的灾难一过去，日头就变黑了，月亮也不放光，众星要从天上坠落。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.9.htm">24:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.29.htm">29</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.19.htm">13:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.24.htm">24</a>）</p><p>“国度”指教会，这一点可见于下文。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 33</h4><p>33. In the tribulation and kingdom and patient awaiting of Jesus Christ. This symbolically means, which in the church have been infested by evils and falsities, but which will be removed by the Lord when He comes.<p>The state of the church is meant by tribulation, when there are no longer any goods of charity and truths of faith, but evils and falsities instead. The church is meant by kingdom. And the patient awaiting of Jesus Christ means the Lord's advent. Consequently these words, "in the tribulation and kingdom and patient awaiting of Jesus Christ," when condensed into a single meaning, symbolically mean, when the goods and truths of the church have been infested by evils and falsities, but ones which the Lord will remove when He comes.<p>That tribulation means the state of the church when it has been infested by evils and falsities is apparent from the following statements:<p>(At the end of the age) they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you... ...there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world..., nor shall be... ...after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven... (<a href="3927/matthew_24_9.htm">Matthew 24:9</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">29</a>, cf. <a href="3927/mark_13_19.htm">Mark 13:19</a>, <a href="3927/mark_13_24.htm">24</a>)<p>We will see in subsequent explanations that a kingdom symbolizes the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 33</h4><p>33. 'In affliction, and in the kingdom, and in the patient expectation of Jesus Christ' signifies those things in the Church which have been infested by evils and untruths, but that those [evils and untruths] are to be removed by the Lord when He comes. By 'affliction' is understood the state of the Church when there are no longer any goods of charity and truths of faith, but in place of them evils and untruths. By 'the kingdom' is understood the Church; and by 'the patient expectation of Jesus Christ' is understood the coming of the Lord. Therefore these words, 'In affliction, and in the kingdom, and in the patient expectation of Jesus Christ,' when gathered together into a single meaning, signify when the good and true things of the Church have been infested by evils and untruths, which however are to be removed by the Lord when He comes. That by 'affliction' is understood the state of the Church when it has been infested by evils and untruths is plain from these [words]:<p>In the consummation of the age they shall deliver you up into affliction, and shall kill you. There shall be great affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the world, nor shall be. After the affliction of those days shall the sun be darkened, the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall down from heaven. <a href="3927/matthew_24_9.htm">Matthew 24:9</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">29</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_19.htm">Mark 13:19</a>, <a href="3927/mark_13_24.htm">24</a>.<p>That 'the kingdom' signifies the Church, will be seen in the things following. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 33</h4><p>33. In affliction and in the kingdom and patient expectation of Jesus Christ, signifies which in the church are infested by evils and falsities, but which will be removed by the Lord when He comes. By "affliction" is meant the state of the church when there are no longer any goods of charity and truths of faith, but in place of them evils and falsities; by "the kingdom," is meant the church; and, by "patient expectation of Jesus Christ," is meant the Lord's coming; therefore these words, "In affliction and in the kingdom and patient expectation of Jesus Christ," when collated into one sense, signify when the goods and truths of the church are infested by evils and falsities, but which will be removed by the Lord when he comes. That by "affliction" is meant the state of the church when it is infested by evils and falsities, is evident from the following:<p>In the consummation of the age, they shall deliver you up into affliction, and shall kill you. There shall be great affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the world, nor shall be. After the affliction of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, (<a href="3927/matthew_24_9.htm">Matthew 24:9</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_24_29.htm">29</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_19.htm">Mark 13:19</a>, <a href="3927/mark_13_24.htm">24</a>).<p>That "the kingdom" signifies the church, will be seen in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 33 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>33. "In afflictione et in regno, et in patiente exspectatione Jesu Christi," significat quae in Ecclesia sunt infestata a malis et falsis, at quae a Domino, cum venturus est, removenda sunt. -Per "afflictionem" intelligitur status Ecclesiae quando amplius non aliqua bona charitatis et vera fidei sunt, sed loco illorum mala et falsa; per "regnum" intelligitur Ecclesia et per "patientem exspectationem Jesu Christi" intelligitur Adventus Domini; quare haec, "In afflictione, et in regno, et in patiente exspectatione Jesu Christi," in unum sensum collata, significant quando bona et vera Ecclesiae infestata sunt a malis et falsis, at quae a Domino, cum venturus est, removenda sunt. Quod per "Afflictionem" intelligatur status Ecclesiae, quando infestata est a malis et falsis, patet ab his: <p>In consummatione saeculi "tradent vos in Afflictionem, et occident vos. Erit Afflictio magna, qualis non fuit ab initio Mundi, nec erit. Post Afflictionem dierum istorum Sol obscurabitur, Luna non dabit lumen suum, et Stellae cadent de Caelo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_33/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_9" target=_top>Matthaeus 24:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_33/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_21" target=_top>21</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_33/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_29" target=_top>29</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_33/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_12_19" target=_top>Marcus 12:19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_33/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_12_24" target=_top>24</a>).<p>Quod "Regnum" significet Ecclesiam, in sequentibus videbitur. </p>
