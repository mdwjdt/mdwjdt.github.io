<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第709节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>709.“就有大声音从天上殿中的宝座上出来，说，成了”表主就这样显明，教会的一切事物都被摧毁，现在最后的审判即将来临。“有大声音从天上殿中出来”表示从主出于天堂至内层的显明；“大声音”表示显明；“天上的殿”表示天堂的至内层，灵流便由此而来（<a href="669.htm">669</a>节）。经上之所以说“从宝座上出来”，是因为“宝座”表示天堂，同样表示审判；“宝座”表示天堂（<a href="221.htm">221</a>，<a href="222.htm">222</a>节），表示审判（<a href="229.htm">229</a>节）；这是因为主现已显明，教会的一切事物都已荒废，因而它的终结已经到来；审判将在教会终结之际施行；所以，经上才说最后一位天使“从天上殿中的宝座上倒他的香瓶”。“成了”表示完结了；也就是说，教会的一切事物都被毁灭了（参看<a href="676.htm">676</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 709</h4><p>709. And a loud voice came out of the temple of heaven from the throne, saying, "It is done!" This symbolically means that it was thus made manifest by the Lord that every element of the church was destroyed, and that the Last Judgment was now imminent.<p>The loud voice coming out of the temple of heaven symbolizes a manifestation by the Lord from the inmost of heaven - the loud voice symbolizing a manifestation, and the temple of heaven symbolizing the inmost of heaven, from which the influx came (no. <a href="669.htm">669</a>). We are told that it came from the throne because the throne symbolizes heaven, and also judgment. That it symbolizes heaven, see nos. <a href="221.htm">221</a>, <a href="222.htm">222</a>; and that it symbolizes judgment, no. <a href="229.htm">229</a>, and this because it was now made manifest that every element of the church had been destroyed, thus that it was at its end, and at the end of a church a judgment takes place. Consequently, when the last angel poured out his bowl, the statement here was heard coming out of the temple of heaven from the throne. "It is done!" symbolically means that it was finished, namely, that every element of the church was destroyed, as may be seen in no. <a href="676.htm">676</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 709</h4><p>709. 'And there went forth a great voice out of the temple of heaven out of the throne saying, It has been done' signifies [that] thus it was made manifest by the Lord that all things of the Church have been devastated, and that now the last judgment is at hand. By 'a great voice going forth out of the temple of heaven' is signified a making manifest by the Lord out of the inmost of heaven; by 'a great voice' the making manifest, and by 'the temple of heaven' is signified the inmost of heaven, out of which the influx [came] (<a href="669.htm">669</a>). 'Out of the throne' is said, because by 'the throne' is signified heaven, and also judgment. That it signifies heaven may be seen (<a href="221.htm">221-222</a>), and judgment (<a href="229.htm">229</a>); and this because it has now been made manifest that all things of the Church have been devastated, thus that it is the end of it, and at the end of the Church there is a judgment. And therefore this is said when the last angel poured out the phial 'out of the temple of heaven out of the throne.' By 'it has been done' is signified that it has been consummated, that is, that all things of the Church have been devastated, as may be seen above (<a href="676.htm">676</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 709</h4><p>709. And there went forth a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne, saying, It is done, signifies that it was thus made manifest by the Lord, that all the things of the church were devastated, and that the Last Judgment was now at hand. By "a great voice going forth out of the temple of heaven" is signified a manifestation from the Lord out of the inmost of heaven; by "a great voice" is signified manifestation; and by "the temple of heaven" the inmost of heaven is signified, from which the influx is, (<a href="669.htm">669</a>). It is said "out of the throne," because heaven is signified by "the throne," and likewise judgment; that it signifies heaven, see <a href="221.htm">221</a>, <a href="222.htm">222</a>; and judgment, <a href="229.htm">229</a>: and this because it is now made manifest that all things of the church were devastated, and thus that its end has come; and at the end of a church a judgment is executed: wherefore this is said when the last angel "poured out his vial from the temple of heaven from the throne." By "It is done" is signified that it is consummated; that is, that all things of the church are devastated; see above, (<a href="676.htm">676</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 709 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>709. "Et exivit vox magna e Templo Caeli e Throno dicens, Factum est," significat sic manifestatum a Domino, quod omnia Ecclesiae devastata sint, et quod nunc Ultimum Judicium instet. - Per "vocem magnam exeuntem e Templo Caeli" significatur manifestatio a Domino ex intimo Caeli; per "vocem magnam" manifestatio, et per "Templum Caeli" significatur intimum Caeli, e quo influxus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_709/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_669" target=_top>669</a>); quod dicatur "e Throno," est quia per "Thronum" significatur Caelum, et quoque judicium; quod Caelum, videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_709/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_221" target=_top>221</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_709/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_222" target=_top>222</a>; et quod judicium, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_709/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_229" target=_top>229</a>; et hoc quia nunc manifestatum est quod omnia Ecclesiae devastata sint, ita quod finis ejus sit, et in fine Ecclesiae fit judicium'; quare hoc dicitur cum ultimus Angelus "effudit phialam e Templo Caeli e Throno:" per "factum est" significatur quod consummatum sit, hoc est, quod devastata sint omnia Ecclesiae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_709/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_676" target=_top>676</a>). </p>
