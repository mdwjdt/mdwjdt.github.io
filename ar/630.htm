<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第630节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>630.“应当敬拜那创造天地海和众水泉源的”表唯独主要受到敬拜，因为唯独祂是创造者，救主，救世主，并且天使天堂和教会，以及它们的一切皆来自祂。“敬拜”表示承认为神圣（参看<a href="579.htm">579</a>，<a href="580.htm">580</a>，<a href="588.htm">588</a>，<a href="603.htm">603</a>节）；“敬拜”论及主时，就表示承认祂为天地之神并敬拜。“创造天地海和众水泉源的”在属世之义上表示创造它们，在属灵之义上表示造就天使天堂和教会，以及它们的一切。“天堂”在属灵之义上表示天使天堂；“地海”在属灵之义上表示教会的内在和外在（<a href="403.htm">403</a>，<a href="404.htm">404</a>，<a href="420.htm">420</a>，<a href="470.htm">470</a>节），“众水泉源”表示服务于教会的教义与生活的一切圣言真理（<a href="409.htm">409</a>节）。</p><p>创造者耶和华是永恒之主，主救主和救世主是生在时间中的主，因而是指主的神性人，这一点《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》从头至尾明显看出来。谁不能理解有一位神是宇宙的创造者，并没有三位创造者？谁不能理解，创世的目的是一个来自人类的天堂与教会？关于这个主题，可参看《圣治》（<a href="../dp/27.htm">27</a>-45节）一书。正因如此，“创造天地”在属灵之义上表示造就天使天堂和教会。经上说这些话的原因如前所述（<a href="613.htm">613</a>节），那里解释了“有父的名，写在额上”表示什么；因为经上曾说过这话，所以此处经上说“应当敬拜那创造天地海和众水泉源的”。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 630</h4><p>630. "And worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water." This symbolically means that the Lord alone is to be worshiped, because He alone is the Creator, Savior, and Redeemer, and because the angelic heaven and the church and everything in them originate from Him alone.<p>To worship means, symbolically, to acknowledge as holy, as may be seen in nos. <a href="579.htm">579</a>, <a href="580.htm">580</a>, <a href="588.htm">588</a>, <a href="603.htm">603</a> above. Consequently, when said in reference to the Lord, to worship means, symbolically, to acknowledge as God of heaven and earth and to worship. To make heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water, in the natural sense means to create them, but in the spiritual sense it symbolically means to form the angelic heaven and the church and everything in them. For heaven symbolizes, in the spiritual sense, the angelic heaven; the earth and the sea symbolize in that sense the internal church and the external church (nos. <a href="403.htm">403</a>, <a href="404.htm">404</a>, <a href="420.htm">420</a>, <a href="470.htm">470</a>); and springs of water symbolize all the Word's truths that serve the church for its doctrine and life (no. <a href="409.htm">409</a>).</p><p>[2] The Creator, Jehovah, is the Lord from eternity, and the Savior and Redeemer is the Lord born in time, thus the Lord in respect to His Divine humanity, as can be seen from beginning to end in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord.<p>Who cannot understand that one God is the creator of the universe, and that there are not three creators? And that creation has as its goal a heaven and church from the human race? (On which subject see Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Providence, nos. <a href="../dp/27.htm">27-45</a>.) So it is that in the spiritual sense to make heaven and the earth means, symbolically, to form the angelic heaven and the church.<p>This is said for the same reason as in no. <a href="613.htm">613</a> above, where we explain what is symbolically meant by having the name of the Father written on their foreheads. And because that was said there, therefore it says here, "worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 630</h4><p>630. 'And adore Him Who has made the heaven and the land and the sea and the fountains of waters' signifies that the Lord Only ought to be worshipped, because He Only is the Creator, Saviour and Redeemer, and from Him Only do the angelic heaven and the Church and all the things thereof exist. That by 'to adore' is signified to acknowledge as holy may be seen above (<a href="579.htm">579-580</a>, <a href="588.htm">588</a>, <a href="603.htm">603</a>), and therefore by 'to adore,' when said of the Lord, is signified to acknowledge as the God of heaven and earth and to worship. By 'to make the heaven and the land and the sea and the fountains of waters' in the natural sense is understood to create them, but in the spiritual sense it signifies to make the angelic heaven and the Church and all the things thereof, for by 'the heaven' in the spiritual sense is signified the angelic heaven. By 'the land and the sea' in that sense is signified the Church internal and external (<a href="403.htm">403-404</a>, <a href="420.htm">420</a>, <a href="470.htm">470</a>), and by 'the fountains of waters' are signified all the truths of the Word of service to the Church for doctrine and life (<a href="409.htm">409</a>).</p><p>[2] That Jehovah the Creator is the Lord from what is eternal, and that the Lord the Saviour and Redeemer is the Lord born in what is temporal, thus as to His Divine Human, can be established from THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD from beginning to end. Who is not able to understand that there is one God the Creator of the universe, and not three Creators? also that the creation had for its end the heaven and Church [formed] out of the human race, concerning which <a href="../dp/27.htm">ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE PROVIDENCE 27-45</a> may be seen. It is for that reason that by 'to make heaven and the land' in the spiritual sense is signified to make the angelic heaven and the Church. These [words of this verse] were said for the same reason as mentioned above (<a href="613.htm">613</a>), where what is signified by their having the Father's Name written on their foreheads is expounded; and because that was said, therefore it is said here 'adore Him Who made the heaven, the land, the sea and the fountains of waters. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 630</h4><p>630. And adore Him that made the heaven and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters, signifies that the Lord alone is to be worshiped, because He alone is the Creator, Savior, and Redeemer, and from Him alone are the angelic heaven and the church, and all things of them. "To adore" signifies to acknowledge as holy, see above, (<a href="579.htm">579</a>, <a href="580.htm">580</a>, <a href="588.htm">588</a>, <a href="603.htm">603</a>); therefore "to adore," when spoken of the Lord, signifies to acknowledge Him as the God of heaven and earth and to worship. "To make the heaven and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters," in the natural sense, means to create them, but in the spiritual sense it signifies to make the angelic heaven and the church, and all things of them. For by "heaven," in the spiritual sense, is signified the angelic heaven; by "the earth and the sea," in that sense, is signified the church internal and external, (<a href="403.htm">403</a>, <a href="404.htm">404</a>, <a href="420.htm">420</a>, <a href="470.htm">470</a>), and by "fountains of waters" are signified all the truths of the Word serving the church for doctrine and life, (<a href="409.htm">409</a>).</p><p>[2] That Jehovah the Creator is the Lord from eternity, and that the Lord the Savior and Redeemer is the Lord born in time, thus as to His Divine Human, may appear from the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord, from beginning to end. Who cannot understand that one God is the Creator of the universe, and that there are not three Creators? as also that creation had for its end a heaven and church from the human race? on which subject see the <a href="../dp/27.htm">Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Providence 27-45</a>. Hence it is that by "making heaven and earth" is signified in the spiritual sense, to make the angelic heaven and the church. These things are said for the reason mentioned above, (<a href="613.htm">613</a>), where it is explained what is signified by "their having the Father's name written on their foreheads;" and because that was said, therefore it is here said, "adore Him who made heaven, earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 630 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>630. "Et adorate Ipsum Qui fecit Caelum et Terram et Mare et Fontes aquarum," significat quod Dominus Solus colendus sit, quia Ipse Solus Creator, Salvator et Redemptor est, et ab Ipso Solo Caelum angelicum et Ecclesia, et omnia illorum sunt. - Quod per "adorare" significetur agnoscere pro sancto, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_630/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_579" target=_top>579</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_630/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_580" target=_top>580</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_630/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_588" target=_top>588</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_630/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_603" target=_top>603</a>); quare per "adorare" cum de Domino, significatur agnoscere pro Deo Caeli et Terrae, et colere; per "facere caelum et terram et mare et fontes aquarum" in Sensu naturali intelligitur creare illa, at in Sensu spirituali significatur facere Caelum angelicum et Ecclesiam, et omnia illorum; per "Caelum" enim in Sensu spirituali significatur Caelum angelicum, per "terram et mare in illo Sensu significatur Ecclesia interna et externa (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_630/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_403" target=_top>403</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_630/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_404" target=_top>404</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_630/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_420" target=_top>420</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_630/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_470" target=_top>470</a>), et per "fortes aquarum" significantur omnia vera Verbi inservientia Ecclesiae pro doctrina et vita (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_630/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_409" target=_top>409</a>). Quod Jehovah Creator sit Dominus ab aeterno, et quod Dominus Salvator et Redemptor sit Dominus natus in tempore, ita quoad Divinum Humanum Suum, constare potest ex Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino a principio ad finem. Quis non intelligere potest quod unus Deus Creator universi sit, et non tres Creatores; tum quod Creatio pro fine habuerit Caelum et Ecclesiam ex humano genere, de qua re videatur Sapientia Angelica de <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_630/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_27" target=_top>Divina Providentia 27-45</a>; inde est, quod per "facere Caelum et Terram in Sensu spirituali significetur facere Caelum angelicum et Ecclesiam. Quod haec dicta sint, est propter eandem causam de qua supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_630/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_613" target=_top>613</a>), ubi explicatur quid significatur per quod "haberent Nomen Patris scriptum super frontibus;" et quia illud dictum est, ideo hic dicitur, adorate Ipsum Qui fecit Caelum, Terram, Mare et Fontes aquarum." </p>
