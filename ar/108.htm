<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第108节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>108.“这些事是那有两刃利剑的说的”表在出于圣言的教义真理方面的主，邪恶与虚假通过这些真理被驱散。第一章描述人子，也就是圣言方面的主之处，经上说：</p><p>从祂口中出来一把两刃的利剑。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.16.htm">2:16</a>）</p><p>从前面（<a href="52.htm">52</a>节）可以看出，这句话表示主藉圣言及其教义驱散一切虚假。这话是说给并涉及那些将教会的一切唯独放在行为，而丝毫不放在教义真理上的人；因为他们无视或轻视教义的真理（其实它是必需的），故主对他们说：</p><p>你当悔改！不然，我就很快临到你那里，用我口中的剑与他们争战。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.16.htm">2:16</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 108</h4><p>108. "'These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword.'" This symbolizes the Lord in relation to doctrinal truths from the Word, by which evils and falsities are dispelled.<p>In the preceding chapter where the Son of Man is described, who is the Lord in relation to the Word, we are told that a sharp two-edged sword was seen to issue from His mouth (verse 16). This symbolizes a dispersion of falsities by the Lord by means of the Word and doctrine drawn from it, as may be seen in no. <a href="52.htm">52</a> above.<p>The declaration here is made to people and concerning people who place everything having to do with the church in good works only, and not anything in doctrinal truths; and because they ignore or have little regard for doctrinal truths, even though those truths are indispensable, they are later told, "Repent, or else I will come to you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of My mouth" (verse 16 in this chapter). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 108</h4><p>108. 'These things says He Who has the sharp two-edged sword' signifies the Lord as to the truths of doctrine out of the Word, by means of which evils and untruths are dispersed. In the preceding chapter, where the SON OF MAN is described, Who is the Lord as to the Word, it is said that a sharp two-edged sword was seen to go forth out of His mouth (verse 16). It may be seen above (<a href="52.htm">52</a>) that by this is signified the dispersion by the Lord of untruths by means of the Word and doctrine therefrom. This is said to and concerning those who place everything of the Church in works alone, and not anything in the truths of doctrine. Because they neglect and despise truths of doctrine, and yet these are necessary, it is said to them in the things that follow, 'Repent, or else I will come to thee quickly, and fight with them with the sword of My mouth' (verse 6 of this chapter) . </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 108</h4><p>108. These things saith He that hath the sharp two-edged sword, signifies the Lord as to the truths of doctrine from the Word, by which evils and falsities are dispersed. In the preceding chapter, where the Son of man is described, Who is the Lord as to the Word, it is said that:<p>A sharp two-edged sword was seen to go out of His mouth, (<a href="3927/revelation_2_16.htm">Revelation 2:16</a>).<p>That by this is signified the dispersion of falsities by the Word, and by doctrine thence from the Lord, may be seen above, (<a href="52.htm">52</a>). This is said to those and concerning those, who place the all of the church in works alone, and not anything in the truths of doctrine; to whom, because they omit or lightly esteem truths of doctrine which yet are necessary, it is said in what follows:<p>Repent, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight with them with the sword of My mouth, (<a href="3927/revelation_2_16.htm">Revelation 2:16</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 108 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>108. "Haec dicit habens romphaeam ancipitem acutam," significat Dominum quoad vera doctrinae ex Verbo, per quae disperguntur mala et falsa. - In praecedente capite, ubi describitur Filius Hominis, Qui est Dominus quoad Verbum, dicitur, quod Ex ore Ipsius romphaea anceps acuta visa sit exire (vers. 16);<p>quod per id significetur dispersio falsorum per Verbum et per doctrinam inde a Domino, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_108/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_52" target=_top>52</a>). Hoc dicitur ad illos et de illis qui omne Ecclesiae ponunt in solis operibus, et non aliquid in veris doctrinae; qui quia vera doctrinae omittunt aut vilipendunt, et usque necessaria sunt, dicitur ad illos in sequentibus, <p>"Resipisce; sin minus, veniam tibi cito, et pugnabo cum illis romphaea oris Mei," (vers. 16 hujus capitis). </p>
