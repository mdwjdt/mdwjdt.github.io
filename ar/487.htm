<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第487节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>487.启11:2.“只是殿外的院子要留下不用量”表如目前这样的地上教会状态要被除去，不为人知。“殿外的院子”表示地上的教会，因为该教会在天堂，也就是“殿”之外（<a href="486.htm">486</a>节）。“要留下”表示要除去它，在此表示从天除去它，因为它的状态到了如此地步；“不用量”表示不去审查并知道它的性质（<a href="486.htm">486</a>节）。原因如下：“这是给了外邦人的，他们要践踏圣城四十二个月”。“殿外的院子”在此表示地上的教会，它仍是那样；这一点从本章下面的经文明显看出来，在那里它被描述为“大城”，按着灵意叫所多玛，又叫埃及，主的两个见证人就死在这城中，后来它在大地震中倒塌，死在其中的人有七千名；此外还有其它细节。</p><p>在圣言其它地方，“院子”（court）表示教会的外在；因为要进入耶路撒冷的圣殿本身，必须经过两个院子；由于“殿”表示教会的内在，故“院子”表示教会的外在；所以，来自外邦列国的外人被允许进入院子，但不许进入圣殿本身。并且由于“院子”表示教会的外在，所以它也表示地上的教会，以及最末端的天堂，因为地上的教会是天堂的入口，最末端的天堂同样是天堂的入口。</p><p>这也是以下经文中的“院子”所表示的：</p><p>你所拣选、住在你院中的，这人便为有福！我们必因你居所的美善、你圣殿的圣洁知足了。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗65.4.htm">65:4</a>）</p><p>你们要赞美耶和华的名，站在耶和华殿中，站在我们神殿的院中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗135.1.htm">135:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗135.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>耶和华啊，你的居所何等可爱；我的灵魂渴想耶和华的院宇。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗84.1.htm">84:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗84.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>当以称谢进入祂的门，以赞美进入祂的院。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗100.4.htm">100:4</a>）</p><p>义人要发旺如棕树；他们栽于耶和华的家中，发旺在我们神的院里。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗92.12.htm">92:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗92.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>在你的院宇一日胜似千日；宁可在我神殿的门槛上站着。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗84.10.htm">84:10</a>）</p><p>还有其它各处（如诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗96.8.htm">96:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗116.19.htm">116:19</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.12.htm">1:12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.9.htm">62:9</a>；撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚3.7.htm">3:7</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结10.3.htm">10:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结10.5.htm">5</a>）。关于耶路撒冷圣殿的院子（列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.36.htm">6:36</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上7.12.htm">7:12</a>）；关于新圣殿的院子（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.17.htm">40:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.44.htm">44</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结42.1.htm">42:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结42.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.4.htm">43:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.7.htm">7</a>）；关于会幕外的院子（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.9.htm">27:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.18.htm">18</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 487</h4><p>487. "But leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it." (<a href="3927/revelation_11_2.htm">11:2</a>) This symbolically means that the state of the church on earth, as it is still, must be set aside and not learned.<p>The court outside the temple symbolizes the church on earth, because that church is outside heaven, heaven being the temple (no. <a href="486.htm">486</a>). To leave out means, symbolically, to remove, here to remove from heaven, because its state is of such a character. And not to measure means, symbolically, not to learn or investigate its character (no. <a href="486.htm">486</a>). The reason follows: "for has been given to the gentiles, and they will tread the holy city underfoot for forty-two months."<p>That the court outside the temple here symbolizes the church on earth as it is still, is apparent from the following particulars in this chapter, where it is described by the great city called Sodom and Egypt, in which the Lord's two witnesses lay dead, and which afterward fell in a great earthquake, and seven thousand people by name were killed in it - and many other particulars besides.</p><p>[2] Elsewhere in the Word the court symbolizes the outward aspect of the church. For there were two courts <sup>1</sup>to be crossed when entering the Temple itself in Jerusalem, and as the Temple symbolized the church in respect to its inner aspect, therefore the courts symbolized the church in respect to its outward one. Consequently strangers who came from the surrounding nations were admitted into the courts, but not into the Temple itself.<p>Moreover, because the court symbolized the outward aspect of the church, it symbolized therefore also the church on earth, and heaven as well in its outmost manifestations, inasmuch as the church on earth is an entryway into heaven, and so is heaven in its outmost manifestations.</p><p>[3] A court has this symbolic meaning in the following places:<p>Blessed is he whom You choose... He shall dwell in Your courts. We shall be satisfied with the goodness of Your house, with the holiness of Your temple. (<a href="3927/psalms_65_4.htm">Psalms 65:4</a>)<p>Praise the name of Jehovah..., O you... who stand in (His) house, in the courts of the house of our God. (<a href="3927/psalms_135_1.htm">Psalms 135:1-2</a>)<p>How lovely are Your habitations, O Jehovah...! My soul... indeed faints for the courts of Jehovah. (<a href="3927/psalms_84_1.htm">Psalms 84:1-2</a>)<p>Enter into His gates with confession, His courts with praise. (<a href="3927/psalms_100_4.htm">Psalms 100:4</a>)<p>The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree... Those who are planted in the house of Jehovah shall sprout in the courts of our God. (<a href="3927/psalms_92_12.htm">Psalms 92:12-13</a>)<p>...a day in Your courts is better than thousands. I have chosen to stand at the door in the house of my God...

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 487</h4><p>487. [verse 2] 'And the court that is outside the temple, exclude, and measure it not' signifies that the state of the Church on earth, such as it is up till now, must be removed and not become known. By 'the court outside the temple' is signified the Church on earth because this is outside of heaven, which is 'the temple' (<a href="486.htm">486</a>). By 'to exclude' is signified to remove, here to remove from heaven because such is its state; and by 'not to measure' is signified not to explore and get to know its quality (<a href="486.htm">486</a>). There follows the reason- 'for it has been given to the nations, and they shall trample upon the holy community forty-two months.' By 'the court outside the temple' is here signified the Church on earth such as it is up till now. This is plain from the things following in this chapter, where this is described by the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, in which the Lord's two witnesses lay slain, and which presently fell in a great earthquake and in it were slain there seven thousand names of men, besides more there.</p><p>[2] Sometimes by 'court' in the Word the external of the Church is signified; for there were two courts that used to be crossed over when they were going into the temple itself in Jerusalem; and because the Church as to its internal was signified by 'the temple,' therefore the Church as to its external was signified by 'the courts.' In consequence of this, strangers who were of the nations [Gentiles] used to be admitted into the courts, but not into the temple itself. And as the external of the Church is signified by a 'court,' therefore also by it is signified the Church on earth and also heaven in ultimates, because the Church on earth is the entrance to heaven and likewise heaven in ultimates.</p><p>[3] This is signified by 'court' in these places:<p>Blessed is he whom Thou choosest, he shall dwell in Thy courts; we shall be satisfied with the good of Thy house, with the holiness of Thy temple. <a href="3927/psalms_65_4.htm">Psalms 65:4</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_65_5.htm">5</a>].<p>Praise the Name of Jehovah, you who stand in His house, in the courts of the house of our God. <a href="3927/psalms_135_1.htm">Psalms 135:1-2</a>.<p>How deserving of love are Thy habitations, O Jehovah, indeed my soul is wasted away for the courts of Jehovah. <a href="3927/psalms_84_1.htm">Psalms 84:1-2</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_84_2.htm">2-3</a>].<p>Enter into His gates in confession, into His courts in praise. <a href="3927/psalms_100_4.htm">Psalms 100:4</a>.<p>The just shall flourish like the palm-tree; those planted in the house of Jehovah shall sprout forth in the courts of our God. <a href="3927/psalms_92_12.htm">Psalms 92:12-13</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_92_13.htm">13-14</a>].<p>A day in Thy courts is better than a thousand, I have chosen to stand at the door in the house of my God. <a href="3927/psalms_84_10.htm">Psalms 84:10</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_84_11.htm">11</a>]; besides elsewhere, as <a href="3927/psalms_96_8.htm">Psalms 96:8</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_116_19.htm">116:19</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_1_12.htm">Isaiah 1:12</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_62_9.htm">62:9</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_3_7.htm">Zechariah 3:7</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3-5</a>.<p>Concerning the courts of the Jerusalem temple, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_36.htm">36</a>.<p>Concerning the courts of the new temple. <a href="3927/ezekiel_40_17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17-44</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_42_1.htm">42:1-14</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_43_4.htm">43:4-7</a>.<p>And concerning the court outside the tabernacle, <a href="3927/exodus_27_9.htm">Exodus 27:9-18</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 487</h4><p>487. Verse 2. But the court which is without the temple cast out, and measure it not, signifies that the state of the church on earth, such as it is at present, is to be removed, and not to be known. By "the court without the temple" is signified the church on earth, this being out of heaven, that is, out of "the temple" (<a href="486.htm">486</a>). By "casting it out" is signified to remove it, in this instance, from heaven, because such is its state; and by "not measuring" is signified not to scrutinize and know its quality, (<a href="486.htm">486</a>). The reason follows; "because it is given unto the Gentiles, and the holy city shall they trample forty-two months." That by "the court out of the temple" is here signified the church on earth such as it still is, appears from what follows in this chapter, where it is described by "the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt," in which the Lord's two witnesses lay killed, and which afterwards fell in a great earthquake, wherein were killed the names of men seven thousand; besides other circumstances.</p><p>[2] By "a court" in the Word in other places, is signified the external of the church; for there were two courts, through which it was necessary to pass, in order to go into the temple itself at Jerusalem; and because by "the temple" was signified the church as to its internal, therefore by "the courts" was signified the church as to its external; wherefore the strangers, who were from the Gentiles, were admitted into the courts, but not into the temple itself. And as the external of the church is signified by "a court," therefore also the church on earth is signified thereby, and also heaven in ultimates, because the church on earth is the entrance to heaven, and likewise heaven in ultimates.</p><p>[3] That is what is signified by "the court" in these passages:<p>Happy is he whom Thou choosest, he shall dwell in Thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of Thy house, with the holiness of Thy temple, (<a href="3927/psalms_65_4.htm">Psalms 65:4</a>).<p>Praise ye the name of Jehovah, ye who stand in His house, in the courts of the house of our God, (<a href="3927/psalms_135_1.htm">Psalms 135:1-2</a>).<p>How lovely are Thy habitations, O Jehovah; yea, my soul is consumed for the courts of Jehovah, (<a href="3927/psalms_84_1.htm">Psalms 84:1-2</a>).<p>Enter into His gates with confession, into His courts with praise, (<a href="3927/psalms_100_4.htm">Psalms 100:4</a>).<p>The just shall flourish like the palm tree; they that be planted in the house of Jehovah shall spring up in the courts of our God, (<a href="3927/psalms_92_12.htm">Psalms 92:12-13</a>).<p>A day in Thy courts is better than a thousand; I have chosen to stand at the door in the house of my God, (<a href="3927/psalms_84_10.htm">Psalms 84:10</a>).<p>(Besides other places, as <a href="3927/psalms_96_8.htm">Psalms 96:8</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_116_19.htm">116:19</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_1_12.htm">Isaiah 1:12</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_62_9.htm">62:9</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_3_7.htm">Zechariah 3:7</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3-5</a>).<p>Concerning the courts of the temple of Jerusalem, (<a href="3927/1-kings_6_3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_36.htm">36</a>). Concerning the courts of the new temple, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17-44</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_42_1.htm">42:1-14</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_43_4.htm">43:4-7</a>).<p>And the court without the tabernacle, (<a href="3927/exodus_27_9.htm">Exodus 27:9-18</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 487 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>487. (Vers. 2.) "Et Atrium quod extra Templum, ejice foras, et ne illud metiaris," significat quod status Ecclesiae in terris, qualis adhuc est, removendus sit, et non cognoscendus. - Per "atrium extra Templum," significatur Ecclesia in terris, quia haec extra Caelum est, quod est "Templum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_487/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486" target=_top>486</a>); per "ejicere foras" significatur removere, hic a Caelo, quia talis ejus status est; et per "non metiri" significatur non scrutari et cognoscere quale ejus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_487/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486" target=_top>486</a>); causa sequitur, "quia datum est gentibus, et Civitatem sanctam conculcabunt mensibus quadraginta duobus." Quod per "atrium extra Templum" hic significetur Ecclesia in terris, qualis adhuc est, patet a sequentibus in hoc capite, ubi illa describitur per "magnam urbem, quae vocatur spiritualiter Sodoma et Aegyptus," in qua occisi jacuerunt bini Domini Testes, et quae postmodum in terrae motu magno cecidit, et in eo occisa sunt ibi nomina hominum millia septem; praeter plura ibi. Alioquin per "atrium" in Verbo significatur externum Ecclesiae; fuerunt enim bina atria, quae transiebantur dum intrarent ipsum Templum in Hierosolyma; et quia per "Templum" significabatur Ecclesia quoad internum ejus, ideo per II atria" significabatur Ecclesia quoad externum ejus; quare in atria admittebantur alienigenae, qui erant ex Gentibus, non autem in ipsum Templum: et quia externum Ecclesiae per "atrium" significatur, ideo etiam per illud significatur Ecclesia in terris, et quoque Caelum in ultimis, quia Ecclesia in terris est introitus in Caelum, similiter Caelum in ultimis.
