<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第809节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>809.启19:5.“有声音从宝座出来说，神的众仆人哪，凡敬畏祂的，都要赞美我们的神”表从主进入天堂的流注，因而天使的一致赞同，即：所有处于信之真理和爱之良善的人都要敬拜主为天堂的独一神。“有声音从宝座出来说”表示从主进入天堂的流注。这流注来自主，因为“坐宝座的”是指主，如刚才所示（<a href="808.htm">808</a>节）。因此，从宝座出来的“声音”是指流注；事实上，主因在从天堂之上，在众天使面前显为一轮太阳，故不是从这太阳向众天使说话，而是流入；凡流入之物，都在天上被接受，并被说出来。所以，那声音，尽管从宝座出来，然而却被约翰听见从天堂出来，因而从那里的天使出来；凡天使出于天堂所说的，皆来自主。“赞美我们的神”表示他们要敬拜主为天堂的独一神。“赞美神”就是敬拜祂，对此，可参看下文。“神的众仆人”表示所有处于信之真理的人（<a href="3.htm">3</a>，<a href="380.htm">380</a>节）；“凡敬畏祂的”表示那些处于爱之良善的人（<a href="527.htm">527</a>，<a href="628.htm">628</a>节）。</p><p>“赞美神”表示敬拜祂，因此对祂的赞美就是对祂的敬拜；这一点从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来，在此引用少许：</p><p>忽然，有一大队天兵同那天使赞美神。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.13.htm">2:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.20.htm">20</a>）</p><p>全体门徒开始大声赞美神。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.37.htm">19:37</a>）</p><p>他们在殿里赞美、称颂神。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.53.htm">24:53</a>）</p><p>要使人听见，你赞美说，耶和华啊，求你拯救你的百姓。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.7.htm">31:7</a>）</p><p>你们要从天上赞美耶和华；在高处赞美祂；祂的众使者都要赞美祂；祂的诸军都要赞美祂；日头月亮，你们要赞美他；放光的星宿，你们都要赞美祂；天上的天，你们都要赞美祂；你们要赞美耶和华的名；从地上赞美耶和华；祂高举众人的赞美。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗 148.1.htm"> 148:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗 148.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗 148.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗 148.13.htm">13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗 148.14.htm">14</a>）</p><p>从婴孩和吃奶的口中完全了赞美。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.16.htm">21:16</a>）</p><p>众人都将赞美归给神。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.43.htm">18:43</a>）</p><p>此处还有其它地方（如以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.8.htm">42:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.18.htm">60:18</a>；约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.26.htm">2:26</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗113.1.htm">113:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗113.3.htm">3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗117.1.htm">117:1</a>）。</p><p>本章所说的这些事与之前有关巴比伦的事无关，而是与接下来有关主要建立的新教会的事有关；此处的事就是下文所论述的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 809</h4><p>809. <a href="3927/revelation_19_5.htm">19:5</a> Then a voice came from the throne, saying, "Praise our God, all you His servants and those who fear Him." This symbolizes an influx from the Lord into heaven and a consequent accord on the part of angels that all those prompted by truths of faith and goods of love worship the Lord as the only God of heaven.<p>The voice that came from the throne symbolizes an influx from the Lord into heaven. It was from the Lord because He who sat on the throne was the Lord, as shown just above in no. <a href="808.htm">808</a>. Therefore an influx is meant by the voice that came from it; for the Lord, being above the heavens and appearing to the angels as a sun, does not speak to angels from there, but flows in, and whatever flows in is received in heaven and given voice. Consequently even though the voice here came from the throne, still John heard it from heaven, thus from angels there, and whatever angels say from heaven is from the Lord.<p>"Praise our God" symbolizes an injunction to worship the Lord as the only God of heaven. That to praise God is to worship Him will be seen below. All His servants symbolize all people who are governed by truths of faith (nos. <a href="3.htm">3</a>, <a href="380.htm">380</a>). All who fear Him symbolize people who are prompted by goods of love (nos. <a href="527.htm">527</a>, <a href="628.htm">628</a>).</p><p>[2] That to praise God means, symbolically, to worship Him, and therefore that praise of Him is worship of Him, is clear from many passages in the Word, of which we will cite just a few:<p>Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of (them) praising God... (<a href="3927/luke_2_13.htm">Luke 2:13</a>, cf. <a href="3927/luke_2_20.htm">2:20</a>)<p>...the whole multitude of the disciples began to... praise God with a loud voice... (<a href="3927/luke_19_37.htm">Luke 19:37</a>)<p>...they were... in the temple praising and blessing God. (<a href="3927/luke_24_53.htm">Luke 24:53</a>)<p>Proclaim, give praise, and say, "O Jehovah, save Your people...." (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_7.htm">Jeremiah 31:7</a>)<p>Praise Jehovah in the heavens; praise Him in the heights! Praise Him... His angels; Praise Him... His hosts! Praise Him, sun and moon; praise Him, all you stars of light! Praise Him, you heavens of heavens... Let them praise the name of Jehovah... Praise Jehovah from the earth... He has exalted... the praise... of all His (people).... (<a href="3927/psalms_148_1.htm">Psalms 148:1-5</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_148_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_148_13.htm">13-14</a>)<p>Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise. (<a href="3927/matthew_21_16.htm">Matthew 21:16</a>)<p>All the people... gave praise to God. (<a href="3927/luke_18_43.htm">Luke 18:43</a>)<p>And so on elsewhere, as in <a href="3927/isaiah_42_8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_60_18.htm">60:18</a>; <a href="3927/joel_2_26.htm">Joel 2:26</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_113_1.htm">Psalms 113:1</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_113_3.htm">3</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_117_1.htm">117:1</a>.<p>What is said in the present verse does not relate to what was said before regarding the Roman Catholic religion, but to what is said hereafter regarding the New Church to be established by the Lord, which is the subject now in the following verses. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 809</h4><p>809. [verse 5] 'And a voice came out of the throne saying, Praise our God, O all His servants, and those fearing Him' signifies an influx from the Lord into heaven, and thus the unanimity of the angels that all who are in the truths of faith and goods of love should worship the Lord as the Only God of heaven. By the 'voice' that 'came out of the throne' is signified an influx from the Lord into heaven. Its being from the Lord is because the One sitting upon the throne was the Lord, as has been shown just above (<a href="808.htm">808</a>). Therefore by the 'voice' coming out therefrom is understood influx, for the Lord, because He is above the heavens and appears before the angels as the Sun, does not speak thence to the angels but inflows; and that which inflows is received in heaven and declared. For this reason that voice, although out of the throne,' yet was heard by John 'out of heaven,' thus from the angels there; and whatever the angels speak 'out of heaven' is from the Lord. By 'praise our God' is signified that they should worship the Lord as the Only God of heaven. That 'to praise God' is to worship Him will be seen below. By 'all His servants' are signified all who are in the truths of faith (<a href="3.htm">3</a>, <a href="380.htm">380</a>). By 'all fearing Him are signified those who are in the goods of love (<a href="527.htm">527</a>, <a href="628.htm">628</a>).</p><p>[2] That 'to praise God' signifies to worship Him, and consequently that the praise of Him is the worship of Him, is established from many passages in the Word, of which only some will be quoted:<p>Suddenly there came to be with the angel a crowd of those praising God. <a href="3927/luke_2_13.htm">Luke 2:13</a>, <a href="3927/luke_2_20.htm">20</a>.<p>The whole crowd of disciples began to praise God with a loud voice. <a href="3927/luke_19_37.htm">Luke 19:37</a>.<p>They were in the temple praising and blessing God. <a href="3927/luke_24_53.htm">Luke 24:53</a>.<p>Cause to be heard, praise, and say, O Jehovah save Thy people. <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_7.htm">Jeremiah 31:7</a>.<p>Praise Jehovah in the heavens, praise Him in the heights, praise Him O His angels, praise Him O His armies, praise Him O sun and moon, praise Him O all the stars of light, praise Him O heavens of heavens; let them praise the Name of Jehovah, O praise Jehovah from the earth. He has exalted praise from all peoples. <a href="3927/psalms_148_1.htm">Psalms 148:1-5</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_148_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_148_13.htm">13-14</a>.<p>Out of the mouth of little children and sucklings thou hast perfected praise. <a href="3927/matthew_21_16.htm">Matthew 21:16</a>.<p>All the people gave praise to God. <a href="3927/luke_18_43.htm">Luke 18:43</a>; besides elsewhere, as <a href="3927/isaiah_42_8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_60_18.htm">60:18</a>; <a href="3927/joel_2_26.htm">Joel 2:26</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_113_1.htm">Psalms 113:1-3</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_117_1.htm">117:1</a>. The things that are said in this verse do not relate to the things preceding concerning Babylon, but to those following concerning the New Church to be set up by the Lord, of which it treats in the things here following. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 809</h4><p>809. Verse 5. (<a href="3927/revelation_19_5.htm">Revelation 19:5</a>) And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye His servants, and ye that fear Him, signifies influx from the Lord into heaven, and thus the unanimity of the angels, that all who are in the truths of faith and in the goods of love should worship the Lord as the only God of heaven. By "the voice which came out of the throne" is signified influx from the Lord into heaven. That it is from the Lord is because "He that sitteth upon the throne" was the Lord, as was shown just above, (<a href="808.htm">808</a>). Therefore by "the voice" that came out therefrom is meant influx; for the Lord, because He is above the heavens, and appears before the angels as a sun, does not speak from it to the angels, but flows in; and that which flows in, is received in heaven, and is uttered. Wherefore that voice, although from the throne, yet was heard by John out of heaven, and thus from the angels there; and whatever the angels speak out of heaven is from the Lord. By "Praise our God" is signified that they should worship the Lord as the only God of heaven. That "to praise God" is to worship Him will be seen below.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 809 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>809. (Vers. 5.) "Et vox e Throno exivit, dicens, Laudate Deum nostrum, omnes servi Ipsius at timentes Ipsum," significat influxum a Domino in Caelum; et sic unanimitatem Angelorum, quod omnes qui in veris fidei et in bonis amoris sunt, colant Dominum ut Solum Deum Caeli. - Per "vocem quae e Throno exivit" significatur influxus a Domino in Caelum; quod sit a Domino, est quia "Sedens super Throno" erat Dominus, ut mox supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_809/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_808" target=_top>808</a>) ostensum est; ideo per "vocem" exeuntem inde intelligitur influxus; nam Dominus, quia supra Caelos est, et apparet coram Angelis ut Sol, non loquitur ad angelos inde, sed influit; et quod influit, hoc recipitur in Caelo ac edicitur, quare vox illa tametsi e Throno, usque audita est a Johanne e Caelo, ita ab angelis ibi; et quicquid angeli e Caelo loquuntur est a Domino; per "laudate Deum nostrum" significatur ut colant Dominum ut Solum Deum Caeli; quod "laudare Deum" sit colere Ipsum, videbitur infra; per "omnes servos Ejus" significantur omnes qui in veris fidei sunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_809/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_3" target=_top>3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_809/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_380" target=_top>380</a>); per "omnes timentes Ipsum" significantur qui in bonis amoris sunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_809/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_527" target=_top>527</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_809/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_628" target=_top>628</a>).
