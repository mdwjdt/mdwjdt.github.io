<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第486节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>486.“天使站在旁边，说，起来，将神的殿和祭坛，并在殿中礼拜的人都量一量”表主的临在和命令，他要看到并知道新天堂中教会的状态。“天使”表示主（在此如在<a href="5.htm">5</a>，<a href="415.htm">415</a>和其它地方那样），因为天使从不凭自己做什么，只通过主行事；因此这天使说“我要使我那两个见证人”（第3节），这些人是主的见证人。“站在一旁”表示主的临在；“说”表示祂的命令；“起来量一量”表示看到并知道；下面将看到，“量”表示知道并审查某个状态的性质。“殿和祭坛，并在殿中礼拜的人”表示新天堂中教会的状态；“殿”表示该教会的教义真理（<a href="191.htm">191</a>节）；“祭坛”表示该教会的爱之良善（<a href="392.htm">392</a>节）；“礼拜的人”表示该教会出于这二者的敬拜。“礼拜的人”在此之所以表示崇拜，也就是敬拜，是因为属灵意义就是从这些人抽象出来的（<a href="78.htm">78</a>，<a href="79.htm">79</a>，<a href="96.htm">96</a>节）；这就是现在这段经文的情况，这一点从以下事实明显可知：约翰被吩咐去“量一量”礼拜的人；事实上，这三者构成教会，即教义的真理、爱之良善和出于这二者的敬拜。</p><p>此处所说的教会是新天堂中的教会，这一事实从本章最后一节经文明显看出来，在那里经上说“神天上的殿开了，在祂殿中现出祂的约柜”（19节）。</p><p>本章开头之所以提到“量殿”，是为了天上的教会在被带入与世上教会的结合之前，其状态可以被看到和知道。世上的教会以“不用量的殿外的院子”来表示，因为它已“给了外邦人”（2节）；然后，这教会又以“叫所多玛，又叫埃及的大城”来描述（7，8节）；不过，后来 “那大城倒塌了”（13节）；由此可知，这个教会成了“主的”（15节及以后）。要知道，地上和天上都有一个教会；它们就像人的内在与外在那样合而为一；所以，主首先提供众天堂中的教会，再通过它或藉着它提供地上的教会；因此，经上说“新耶路撒冷由神那里从新天降下”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.1.htm">21:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.2.htm">2</a>）。“新天”表示由基督徒构成的新天堂，这在以下章节中多有论述。</p><p>“量”（To measure）表示知道并审查性质；因为“尺寸”（a measure）表示事物的性质，或状态；这一切由新耶路撒冷的一切尺寸（21章），以及那里的这些话来表示：</p><p>天使拿着一根金芦苇量那城和城门，又量了城墙，按着人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸，共有一百四十四肘。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.15.htm">21:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.17.htm">17</a>）。</p><p>由于“新耶路撒冷”表示新教会，故显而易见，“量”它及其所属之物就表示知道性质。在以西结书，“量”所表相同，在那里，经上说：</p><p>天使量神的家，殿，祭坛，院子和屋子。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.3.htm">40:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.1.htm">41:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.13.htm">13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.22.htm">22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.42.htm">42</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.43.htm">43</a>）</p><p>他又量众水。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.3.htm">47:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p>故经上说：</p><p>将（殿的）样式指示以色列家，使他们因自己的罪孽惭愧；他们要量殿的样式、出入之处，和一切形状，使他们遵照一切样式。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.10.htm">43:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.11.htm">11</a>）</p><p>在以下地方，“量”所表相同：</p><p>我又举目观看，见一人手拿准绳；我说，你往哪里去？他说，去量耶路撒冷。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.1.htm">2:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>他站立，量了大地。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.6.htm">3:6</a>）</p><p>主耶和华曾用掌心量诸水，用手虎口量诸天，用秤称高山，用天平平小山。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.12.htm">40:12</a>）</p><p>我立大地根基的时候，你在哪里呢？是谁定地的尺度？是谁把准绳拉在其上？（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯38.4.htm">38:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯38.5.htm">5</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 486</h4><p>486. And the angel stood by, saying, "Rise and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship there." This symbolizes the Lord's presence and His command to see and learn the state of the church in the New Heaven.<p>The Lord is meant by the angel, here as in nos. <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="415.htm">415</a>, and elsewhere, since an angel does nothing of himself but is impelled by the Lord. That is why the angel said, "I will give power to my two witnesses" (verse 3), when they were the Lord's witnesses. The angel's standing by symbolizes the Lord's presence, and his speaking symbolizes the Lord's command. To rise and measure means, symbolically, to see and learn. We will see below that to measure means, symbolically, to learn and investigate the character of a state.<p>The temple, altar, and those who worship there symbolize the state of the church in the New Heaven - the temple symbolizing the church in respect to its doctrinal truth (no. <a href="191.htm">191</a>), the altar symbolizing the church in respect to the goodness of its love (no. <a href="392.htm">392</a>), and those who worship there symbolizing the church in respect to its formal worship as a result of those two elements. Those who worship symbolize here the reverence that is a part of formal worship, since the spiritual sense is a sense abstracted from persons (nos. <a href="78.htm">78</a>, <a href="79.htm">79</a>, <a href="96.htm">96</a>), as is apparent here also from the fact that John is told to measure the worshipers. These three elements are what form the church: doctrinal truth, goodness of love, and formal worship as a result of these.</p><p>[2] That the church meant is the church in the New Heaven is apparent from the last verse of this chapter, where we are told that "the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple" (verse 19).<p>This chapter begins with the measuring of the temple in order that the state of the church in heaven might be seen and learned before its conjunction with the church in the world. The church in the world is meant by the court outside the temple, which John was not to measure, because it had been given to the gentiles (verse 2). The same church is then described by the great city called Sodom and Egypt (verses 7, 8). But after that great city fell (verse 13), it follows that the church became the Lord's (verses 15ff.).<p>It should be known that the church exists in the heavens just as on earth, and that the two are united like the inner and outer selves in people. Consequently the Lord provides the church in heaven first, and from it, or by means of it, then the church on earth. That is why the New Jerusalem is said to come down from God out of the New Heaven (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21:1-2</a>).<p>The New Heaven means a new heaven formed from Christians, as described several times in the following chapters.</p><p>[3] To measure means, symbolically, to learn and investigate the character of a thing because the measure of something symbolizes its character or state. All the measurements of the New Jerusalem (chapter 21) have this symbolic meaning, as does the statement there that the angel who had the gold reed measured the city and its gates, and that he measured the wall to be one hundred and forty-four cubits, the measure of a man which is that of an angel (verses 15, 17). Moreover, because the New Jerusalem symbolizes the New Church, is it apparent that to measure it and its component parts means, symbolically, to learn its character.<p>Measuring has the same symbolic meaning in Ezekiel, where we read that an angel measured the house of God: the temple, the altar, the court, and the chambers (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3-17</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_41_1.htm">41:1-5</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_41_13.htm">13-14</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_41_22.htm">22</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_42_1.htm">42:1-20</a>, and <a href="3927/ezekiel_43_1.htm">43:1-27</a>). Also that he measured the waters (<a href="3927/ezekiel_47_3.htm">47:3-5</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_9.htm">9</a>). Therefore the prophet is told:<p>...show the temple to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and they shall measure the pattern... and... its exits and its entrances, and all its patterns..., so that they may keep its whole design... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_43_10.htm">Ezekiel 43:10-11</a>)<p>Measuring has the same symbolic meaning in the following places:<p>I raised my eyes..., and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand. So I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem...." (<a href="3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">Zechariah 2:1-2</a>)<p>He stood and measured the earth. (<a href="3927/habakkuk_3_6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>)<p>(The Lord Jehovih) has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and gauged heaven with a span... and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance. (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>)<p>Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? ...Who determined its measurements? ...Or who stretched the line upon it? (<a href="3927/job_38_4.htm">Job 38:4-5</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 486</h4><p>486. 'And the angel stood by, saying, Arise and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those adoring therein' signifies the Lord's presence and His command, that He might see and get to know the state of the Church in the New Heaven. By 'the angel' is understood the Lord (here as <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="415.htm">415</a>, and elsewhere), since an angel does nothing of himself but of the Lord. He therefore says, 'I will give unto My two witnesses' (verse 3), and these were the Lord's witnesses. By 'stood by' is signified the Lord's presence, and by His 'saying' is signified His command. By Arise and measures is signified to see and get to know; that 'to measure' signifies to get to know and to explore the quality of a state will be seen below. By 'the temple, the altar and those adoring therein' is signified the state of the Church in the New Heaven; by 'the temple' the Church as to truth of doctrine (<a href="191.htm">191</a>); by 'the altar' the Church as to good of love (<a href="392.htm">392</a>); and by 'those adoring' is signified the Church as to worship derived from these two. By 'those adoring' here is signified the adoration that is of worship, for the spiritual sense is abstracted from persons (<a href="78.htm">78-79</a>, <a href="96.htm">96</a>), and this also is plain here from the fact that it is said 'to measure those adoring.' There are indeed these three things that make the Church, truth of doctrine, good of love, and worship derived from them.</p><p>[2] That it is the Church in the New Heaven that is understood is plain from the last verse of this chapter where it is said that:<p>The temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of the covenant was seen in the temple verse 19.<p>Measuring the temple is spoken of at the beginning of this chapter so that the state of the Church in heaven might be seen and become known before that had been conjoined to the Church in the world. The Church in the world is understood by 'the court outside the temple,' which should not be measured because it was 'given to the nations' (verse 2); and then it is described by 'the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt' (verses 7-8); but afterwards that great city 'fell' (verse 13). It follows that the Church 'became the Lord's' (verse 15 seq.). It should be known that there is a Church in the heavens as well as on earth (in terris), and that they make one just as the internal and external with men; and therefore a Church is first provided by the Lord in the heavens, and out of this or by means of this a Church on earth. Consequently it is said that the New Jerusalem comes down from God out of the New Heaven (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21:1-2</a>). By 'the New Heaven' is understood the New Heaven [formed] out of Christians, of which it treats frequently in the things following.</p><p>[3] 'To measure' signifies to get to know and to explore the quality because by the 'measure' is signified the quality of a thing or state. This is signified by all the measurements of the New Jerusalem (chapter xxi), and by these statements there:<p>That the angel having the golden reed measured the city and the gates thereof; and that he measured the wall 144 cubits, the measure of a man, that is, of an angel (verse 15, 17); and because by 'the New Jerusalem' is signified the New Church, it is plain that by 'to measure' it and the things thereof is signified to get to know the quality. The like is signified by 'to measure' in Ezekiel, where it is said:<p>That the angel measured the house of God, the temple, the altar, the court, the chambers. <a href="3927/ezekiel_40_3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3-17</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_41_1.htm">41:1-5</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_41_13.htm">13-14</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_41_22.htm">22</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_42_1.htm">42</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_43_1.htm">43</a>.<p>Also that 'he measured the waters' (<a href="3927/ezekiel_47_3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3-5</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_9.htm">9</a>). Therefore it is said:<p>Show the house <sup>1</sup>to the house of Israel, and let them be ashamed of their iniquities; and they shall measure the form and its exit and its entrance and all the forms thereof that they may keep all the form. <a href="3927/ezekiel_43_10.htm">Ezekiel 43:10-11</a>.<p>The like is signified by 'to measure' in these places:<p>I lifted up mine eyes, and behold a man, in whose hand was a measuring line, and I said, Whither goest thou? and he said, To measure Jerusalem, <a href="3927/zechariah_3_2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_3_4.htm">4</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/zechariah_3_5.htm">Zechariah 3:5-6</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_3_8.htm">8</a>].<p>He stood and measured the land, <a href="3927/habakkuk_3_6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>.<p>The Lord Jehovih has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out the heavens with the span, and weighed the mountains in a scale, and the hills in a balance. <a href="3927/isaiah_40_12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>.<p>Where wast thou when I was founding the land? Who set out its measurements? and who stretched out the line upon it? <a href="3927/job_38_4.htm">Job 38:4-6</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Reading Domum (house) as in Hebrew instead of Formam (form), which the Original has here. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 486</h4><p>486. And the angel stood by, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that adore in it, signifies the Lord's presence and His command, that he should see and know the state of the church in the New Heaven. By "angel" is meant the Lord (here as in <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="415.htm">415</a>, and other places), because an angel never does anything from himself, but only from the Lord; therefore he says, "I will give My two witnesses" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_11_3.htm">3</a>), and these were the Lord's witnesses. By "standing by" is signified the Lord's presence; and by "saying" is signified His command; by "rise and measure" are signified to see and know; that "to measure" signifies to know and scrutinize the quality of a state, will be seen below. By "the temple, the altar, and them that adore in it," is signified the state of the church in the New Heaven; by "the temple," the church as to the truth of doctrine, (<a href="191.htm">191</a>); by "the altar," the church as to the good of love, (<a href="392.htm">392</a>); and by "them that adore" is signified the church as to worship from these two. By "them that adore" is here signified adoration, which is worship, because the spiritual sense is abstracted from the persons, (<a href="78.htm">78-79</a>, <a href="96.htm">96</a>); that this is the case in the present passage, is evident from this, that he was told "to measure" them that adore; for these three things make the church, the truth of doctrine, the good of love, and worship from them.</p><p>[2] That it is the church in the New Heaven which is meant, is plain from the last verse of this chapter, where it is said, that "the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in the temple the ark of the covenant" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_11_19.htm">19</a>). The reason why "the measuring the temple" is spoken of at the beginning of this chapter is in order that the state of the church in heaven, before it was brought into conjunction with the church in the world, might be seen and known. The church in the world is meant by "the court without the temple, which was not to be measured, because it was given to the Gentiles" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_11_2.htm">2</a>); and then it is described by "the great city, which is called Sodom and Egypt" (verses <a href="3927/revelation_11_7.htm">7-8</a>); but afterwards "that great city fell" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_11_13.htm">13</a>); it follows that the church "was become the Lord's" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_11_15.htm">15</a>, and subsequent verses). It is to be known, that there is a church in the heavens as well as on earth; and that they make one, like the internal and external with man; wherefore the church in the heavens is first provided by the Lord, and from it, or by it, the church on earth; thence, it is said, that the New Jerusalem came down from God out of the New Heaven (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21:1-2</a>). By "the New Heaven" is meant the New Heaven from Christians, which is frequently treated of in the following pages.</p><p>[3] "To measure" signifies to know and scrutinize the quality; because by "a measure" is signified the quality of a thing, or state; this is signified by all the measures of the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21); and also by these words, which occur there:<p>The angel having a golden reed, measured the city and the gates thereof; and he measured the wall, one hundred and forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, that is, of an angel, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_15.htm">Revelation 21:15</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_17.htm">17</a>).<p>And as by "the New Jerusalem" is signified the New Church, it is plain by "measuring" it and the things which are of it, is signified to know the quality. The same is signified by "measuring" in Ezekiel, where it is said that:<p>The angel measured the house of God, the temple, the altar, the court, the chambers, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3-17</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_41_1.htm">41:1-5</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_41_13.htm">13-14</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_41_22.htm">22</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_42_1.htm">42</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_43_1.htm">43</a>).<p>He measured the waters, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_47_3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3-5</a>).<p>And therefore it is said:<p>Show the form to the house of Israel, and let them be ashamed of their iniquities: and they shall measure the form and its exit and its entrance and all the forms of it, that they may guard all the form, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_43_10.htm">Ezekiel 43:10-11</a>).<p>The same is signified by "measuring" in these places:<p>I lifted up my eyes, and behold, a man, in whose hand was a measuring line; and I said, Whither goest thou? and he said, To measure Jerusalem, (<a href="3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">Zechariah 2:1-2</a>).<p>He stood and measured the earth, (<a href="3927/habakkuk_3_6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>).<p>The Lord Jehovah measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out the heavens with the span, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance, (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>).<p>Where wast thou when I founded the earth? who set the measures of it? and who stretched out the line upon it, (<a href="3927/job_38_4.htm">Job 38:4-5</a>)? </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 486 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>486. "Et Angelus adstitit, dicens, surge et metire Templum Dei et Altare et adorantes in eo," significat praesentiam Domini et mandatum Ipsius, ut videret et cognosceret statum Ecclesiae in Novo Caelo. - Per "Angelum" intelligitur Dominus (hic ut 5, 415, et alibi), quoniam Angelus nihil facit ex se sed ex Domino; quare dixit, "dabo duobus Testibus Meis," (vers. 3), et illi erant Testes Domini; per "adstitit" significatur praesentia Domini, et per "dixit" significatur mandatum Ipsius; per "surgere et metiri" significatur videre et cognoscere; quod "metiri" significet cognoscere et scrutari quale status, videbitur infra; per "Templum, Altare et adorantes in eo," significatur status Ecclesiae in Novo Caelo, per "Templum" Ecclesia quoad Verum doctrinae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_191" target=_top>191</a>), per "Altare" Ecclesia quoad Bonum amoris (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_392" target=_top>392</a>), et per "adorantes" significatur Ecclesia quoad cultum ex illis binis; per "adorantes" hic significatur adoratio, quae est cultus, quoniam Sensus spiritualis est abstractus a personis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_78" target=_top>78</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_79" target=_top>79</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_96" target=_top>96</a>), quod etiam hic patet ex eo, quod dicatur "metiri" adorantes; sunt etiam tria illa quae faciunt Ecclesiam, Verum doctrinae, Bonum amoris, et Cultus ex illis. Quod sit Ecclesia in Novo Caelo quae intelligitur, patet a versu ultimo hujus capitis, ubi dicitur quod "apertum sit Templum Dei in Caelo, et visa Arca foederis in Templo," (vers. 19). Quod in principio hujus capitis de "metiendo Templo" dicatur, est ut videatur et cognoscatur status Ecclesiae in Caelo, antequam illa conjuncta esset Ecclesiae in Mundo; Ecclesia in Mundo intelligitur per "atrium extra Templum, quod ille non metiretur, quia datum gentibus", (vers. 2); et dein describitur per "magnam urbem, quae vocatur Sodoma et Aegyptus," (vers. 7, 8); at postquam magna illa urbs "cecidit," (vers. 13), sequitur quod Ecclesia "facta sit Domini," (vers. 15, seq.). Sciendum est, quod in Caelis aeque sit Ecclesia ut in terris; et quod unum faciant sicut internum et externum apud homines; quare Ecclesia in Caelis primum providetur a Domino, et ex illa seu per illam Ecclesia in terris; inde dicitur quod Nova Hierosolyma a Deo e Novo Caelo descenderit, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_2" target=_top>21:2</a>). Per "Novum Caelum" intelligitur novum Caelum ex Christianis, de quo in sequentibus pluries agitur. Quod "metiri" significet cognoscere et scrutari quale, est quia per "mensuram" significatur quale rei aut status; hoc significatur per omnes mensuras Novae Hierosolymae, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_1-27" target=_top>21</a>), et per haec ibi, quod Angelus habens calamum aureum, Mensus sit urbem et portas ejus; et quod Mensus sit murum centum quadraginta quatuor cubitorum; Mensura hominis quae est angeli (vers. 15, 17);<p>et quia per "Novam Hierosolymam" significatur Nova Ecclesia, patet quod per "metiri" illam et quae ejus sunt, significetur cognoscere quale. Simile significatur per "metiri" apud Ezechielem, ubi dicitur, quod Angelus Mensus sit Domum Dei, Templum, Altare, Atrium, Cubicula, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_40_3-17" target=_top>40:3-17</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_41_1-5" target=_top>41:1-5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_41_13-14" target=_top>13-14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_41_22" target=_top>22</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_42_1-20" target=_top>42</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_43_1-27" target=_top>43</a>);<p>et quod Mensus aquas, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_47_3-5" target=_top>47:3-5</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>quare dicitur "Ostende domui Israelis Domum, <sup>2</sup>et pudefient ab iniquitatibus suis: et Metientur Formam et exitus ejus et introitus ejus et omnes Formas ejus, ut custodiant omnem Formam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_43_10-11" target=_top>Ezechiel 43:10-11</a>).<p>Simile significatur per "metiri" in his locis: <p>"Sustuli oculos meos, et ecce vir, cujus in manu funiculus mensurae; et dixi, Quo pergis; et dixit, Ad Metiendum Hierosolymam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_2_5-6" target=_top>Sacharias 2:5-6</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_2_1-2" target=_top>1-2</a>); <sup>3</sup><p>"Stetit et Mensus est Terram," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_habakkuk_3_6" target=_top>Habakuk 3:6</a>);<p>Dominus Jehovih "Mensus est pugillo aquas, et Caelos spithama exaequavit, et appendit in lance montes, et colles in libra," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_40_12" target=_top>Esaias 40:12</a>);<p>"Ubi fuisti cum fundarem terram, quis posuit Mensuras ejus, et quis extendit super ea lineam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_486/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_job_38_4-5" target=_top>Hiob 38:4-5</a>). <sup>4</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;3-5 pro "3, 4, 5, 9"<p>2.&nbsp;Domum pro "Formam"<p>3.&nbsp;5, 6 pro "5, 6, 8"<p>4.&nbsp;38:4, 5 pro "28:4, 5" </p>
