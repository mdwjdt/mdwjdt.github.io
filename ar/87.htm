<p>87.“圣灵向众教会所说的话，凡有耳的，就应当听”表圣言的神性真理所教导那些将属于新教会，就是新耶路撒冷之人的，凡理解的人，都应当遵守。“听”既表理解，也表遵守，因为人注意听是为了理解和遵守。“听”表示这二者，这一点从日常用语明显可知，在日常用语中，人们会说“倾听”、“听从”，前者表示理解，后者表示遵守。“听”具有这两种含义，是出于对应；因为位于天堂耳部区域的天使就处在理解，同时遵守的状态。由于“听”表示理解和遵守这二者，所以主经常说：</p><p>凡有耳的，就应当听。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.15.htm">11:15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.43.htm">13:43</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.9.htm">4:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.23.htm">23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可7.16.htm">7:16</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.8.htm">8:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.35.htm">14:35</a>）</p><p>这话同样说给了众教会，这从本章明显可知（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.11.htm">2:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.29.htm">29</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.6.htm">3:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.22.htm">22</a>）。向众教会说话的“圣灵”表示圣言的神性真理；“众教会”表基督教界的整个教会。“神的灵”，也就是“圣灵”表示从主所发出的神性真理，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》（<a href="../lord/51.htm">51</a>节）。由于所指的是整个教会，故经上不是说“圣灵向教会所说的话”，而是说“圣灵向众教会所说的话”。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 87</h4><p>87. "'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'" (<a href="3927/revelation_2_7.htm">2:7</a>) This symbolically means that anyone who understands these things, let him obey what the Divine truth of the Word teaches those who will be members of the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem.<p>To hear means, symbolically, both to perceive and to obey, because a person pays attention in order to perceive and obey. That both are symbolically meant by hearing is apparent from common speech, in which people speak of hearing someone or something, and of listening to someone or something, the first signifying to perceive, the latter to obey.<p>To hear has both symbolic meanings owing to correspondence, for the province of the ears in heaven is occupied by people who possess perception and at the same time are obedient.<p>Since hearing has both symbolic meanings, therefore the Lord says so many times, "He who has an ear to hear, let him hear!" (<a href="3927/matthew_11_15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_13_43.htm">13:43</a>; <a href="3927/mark_4_9.htm">Mark 4:9</a>, <a href="3927/mark_4_23.htm">23</a>; <a href="3927/mark_7_16.htm">7:16</a>; <a href="3927/luke_8_8.htm">Luke 8:8</a>; <a href="3927/luke_14_35.htm">14:35</a>) And the same command is also addressed to all the churches here, as is apparent from verses <a href="3927/revelation_2_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_2_17.htm">17</a>, and <a href="3927/revelation_2_29.htm">29</a> in this chapter, and from verses <a href="3927/revelation_2_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_2_13.htm">13</a>, and <a href="3927/revelation_3_22.htm">22</a> in the following chapter.<p>The spirit that speaks to the churches, moreover, symbolizes the Divine truth of the Word, and the churches symbolize the entire church throughout the Christian world. To be shown that the Divine truth emanating from the Lord is meant by the spirit of God, which is the same as the Holy Spirit, see The Doctrine of the New Church Regarding the Lord<a href="../lord/51.htm">51</a>. And because the entire church is meant, we are told not what the spirit says to the church (singular), but what the spirit says to the churches (plural). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 87</h4><p>87. [verse 7] 'He who has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the Churches' signifies that he who understands those things obeys what the Divine Truth of the Word teaches those who will be of the New Church (e nova Ecclesia) that is the New Jerusalem. By 'to hear' is signified both to perceive and to obey, because one pays attention in order to perceive and obey. That the one and the other is signified by 'to hear,' is plain from common parlance, in which to hear or heed anyone is said, also to hearken or give heed to anyone, the latter signifying to obey and the former to perceive. That 'to hear' signifies these two things results from Correspondence, for those who are at the same time in perception and obedience are in the province of the ears in heaven. Since the one and the other is signified by 'to hear,' therefore the Lord so often said:<p>He who has an ear to hear, let him hear. <a href="3927/matthew_11_15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_13_43.htm">13:43</a>; <a href="3927/mark_4_9.htm">Mark 4:9</a>, <a href="3927/mark_4_23.htm">23</a>; <a href="3927/mark_7_16.htm">7:16</a>; <a href="3927/luke_8_8.htm">Luke 8:8</a>; <a href="3927/luke_14_35.htm">14:35</a>; and the like is also said to all the Churches, as is plain from verses 11, 17, and 29 of this chapter, and from verses 6, 13, and 22 of the one following. By 'the Spirit,' however, 'that says to the Churches' is signified the Divine Truth of the Word, and by 'the Churches' the entire Church in Christendom. That by 'the Spirit of God,' which is the Holy Spirit, is understood the Divine Truth (Veritas) proceeding from the Lord, may be seen in <a href="../lord/51.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord 51</a>; and since the entire Church is understood, it is not said what the Spirit says to the Church, but what the Spirit says to 'the Churches. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 87</h4><p>87. Verse 7. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches, signifies that he who understands, ought to obey what the Divine truth of the Word teaches those who will be of the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem. By "hearing" is signified both to perceive and to obey; because one attends that he may perceive and obey; that both these are signified by "hearing" is evident from common discourse, in which one speaks of hearing and of hearkening to anyone; the latter signifying to obey, and the former to perceive. That "hearing" has these two significations is from correspondence; for those are in the province of the ears in heaven, who are in perception and at the same time in obedience. As both these things are signified by "hearing" therefore the Lord so often said:<p>He that hath an ear to hear let him hear, (<a href="3927/matthew_11_15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_13_43.htm">13:43</a>; <a href="3927/mark_4_9.htm">Mark 4:9</a>, <a href="3927/mark_4_23.htm">23</a>; <a href="3927/mark_7_16.htm">7:16</a>; <a href="3927/luke_8_8.htm">Luke 8:8</a>; <a href="3927/luke_14_35.htm">14:35</a>).<p>And the same is likewise said to all the churches, as is evident from verses 11, 17, 29, of this chapter, and from verses <a href="3927/revelation_3_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_3_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_3_22.htm">22</a>, of the following. But by the "Spirit" which speaks to the churches is signified the Divine truth of the Word; and by "the churches" the entire church in the Christian world. That by "the Spirit of God" which is also the Holy Spirit is meant the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord, (<a href="51.htm">51</a>); and as the entire church is meant, it is not said, what the Spirit saith to the church, but "what the Spirit saith to the churches." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 87 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>87. (Vers. 7) "Habens aurem audiat quid Spiritus dicit Ecclesiis," significat quod qui illa intelligit, obediat quae Divinum Verum Verbi docet illos, qui e nova Ecclesia, quae est Nova Hierosolyma, erunt. - Per "audire" significatur et percipere et obedire, quia attendit ut percipiat ac ut obediat; quod utrumque hoc significetur per "audire," patet a communi sermone, in quo dicitur audire et auscultare aliquem, tum audire et auscultare alicui; hoc significat obedire, ac illud percipere: quod "audire" illa duo significet, est ex correspondentia; nam in provincia aurium in Caelo sunt illi qui in perceptione et simul obedientia sunt. Quoniam utrumque hoc significatur per "audire," ideo Dominus toties dixit, <p>"Qui habet aurem ad audiendum audiat," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_87/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_11_15" target=_top>Matthaeus 11:15</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_87/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_13_43" target=_top>13:43</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_87/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_4_9" target=_top>Marcus 4:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_87/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_4_23" target=_top>23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_87/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_7_16" target=_top>7:16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_87/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_8_8" target=_top>Luca 8:8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_87/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_14_35" target=_top>14:35</a>).<p>Et quoque simile dicitur ad omnes Ecclesias, ut patet a versibus 11, 17, 29, hujus capitis, et a versibus 6, 13, 22, sequentis. Per "Spiritum" autem, qui dicit Ecclesiis, significatur Divinum Verum Verbi, et per "Ecclesias" universa Ecclesia in Christiano Orbe: quod per "Spiritum Dei," qui etiam est Spiritus Sanctus, intelligatur Divina Veritas procedens a Domino, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_87/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_51" target=_top>Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 51</a> et quia universa Ecclesia intelligitur, non dicitur quid Spiritus dicit Ecclesiae, sed "quid Spiritus dicit Ecclesiis. </p>
