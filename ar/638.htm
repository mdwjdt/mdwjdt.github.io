<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第638节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>638.启14:12.“圣徒的忍耐就在此。守神诫命，和耶稣基督信仰的也在此”表主的教会之人通过源于他们的试探，在其遵行圣言诫命的生活和对主之信的性质上接受检查。这就是这些话的含义（参看<a href="593.htm">593</a>节）。“守诫命”表示照包含在十诫概要中的诫命生活；“耶稣信仰”表示对祂的信仰，因为这些人从主那里拥有信仰，也就是耶稣信仰。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 638</h4><p>638. <a href="3927/revelation_14_12.htm">14:12</a> Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. This symbolically means that by temptations or trials induced by vexations, a person belonging to the Lord's church is explored as to his character in respect to his life in accordance with the Word's commandments and to his faith in the Lord.<p>That this is the symbolic meaning of these words may be seen in no. <a href="593.htm">593</a> above. To keep the commandments means, symbolically, to live in accordance with the Word's commandments, which are contained in summary form in the Ten Commandments. And the faith of Jesus symbolizes faith in Him, as people [who live in accordance with the Word's commandments] have their faith from Him, the faith that is the faith of Jesus. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 638</h4><p>638. [verse 12] 'Here is the patience of the saints, here are those keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus' signifies that the man of the Lord's Church is examined by means of temptations from those [in faith separated from charity] as to the quality of his life in accordance with the precepts of the Word and as to faith directed to the Lord. That these things are signified by these words may be seen above (<a href="593.htm">593</a>). By 'to keep the commandments' is signified to live in accordance with the precepts that are contained in a summary in the Decalogue, and by 'the faith of Jesus' is signified a faith directed to Him, for these have faith from the Lord, and this faith is 'the faith of Jesus. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 638</h4><p>638. Verse 12. Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, signifies that the man of the Lord's church, by temptations from them, is explored with regard to his quality as to a life according to the commandments of the Word, and as to faith in the Lord. That this is the signification of these words, see above, (<a href="593.htm">593</a>). "To keep the commandments" signifies to live according to the precepts which are contained in a summary in the Decalogue; and by "the faith of Jesus" is signified faith in Him, for these have faith from the Lord, which is the faith of Jesus. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 638 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>638. (Vers. 12.) "Hic <sup>1</sup>patientia sanctorum est, hic custodientes mandata Dei et fidem Jesu," significat quod homo Ecclesiae Domini per tentationes ab illis exploretur qualis est quoad vitam secundum praecepta Verbi et quoad fidem in Dominum.--Quod haec significentur per illa verba, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_638/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_593" target=_top>593</a>); per "custodire mandata" significatur vivere secundum praecepta, quae in summario continentur in Decalogo, et per "fidem Jesu" significatur fides in Ipsum, nam illi fidem habent a Domino, quae fides est fides Jesu.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Hic pro "Haec" </p>
