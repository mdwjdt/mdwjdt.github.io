<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第451节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>451.“马的头好像狮子头”表关于唯信仿佛大有能力的妄想。“头”表示他们对唯信的想象和幻想，也就是此处所论述的，用一个词来概括，就是所谓的“妄想”。“马”表示其心智内层的推理，它们就是如此（<a href="449.htm">449</a>节）；“狮子”表示能力（<a href="241.htm">241</a>节）；不过，这是出自谬论的能力，因为他们是感官的，感官人通过他们藉以说服并迷惑人的谬论来推理（<a href="424.htm">424</a>节）。</p><p>只要稍稍提升自己的思想，谁都能看出，他们支持唯信的论据都是想象和幻想。如他们所设想的行为中的信和状态中的信不就是幻想吗？当没有良善从人进入行为中的信时，他们当中有谁知道关于行为中的信的情况，以及是什么使得信在状态中有效？罪的赦免，因而瞬间得救，不就是幻想的结果吗？这就是教会中“火焰的飞蛇”，对此，可参看《圣治》（<a href="../dp/340.htm">340</a>节）。由归算所产生的对豁免、功德、公义和神圣的估价，不也是幻想吗？对此，可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》（<a href="../lord/18.htm">18</a>节）。</p><p>若没有人貌似凭自己于外在的合作，内在中的神性运作是什么呢？因为将内在与外在分离，以至于它们不可能有结合，这纯粹是幻想（参看下文，<a href="606.htm">606</a>节）。与仁分离之信就是这样一种幻想；因为行为中的仁是信的容器和根基；是信的土壤和大地，还是信的本质和生命；总而言之，出自仁之信就是这个人；而无仁之信就是一个幽灵和幻想的生物，就像产物形像，如漂浮在空中的水泡。或许有人会说，你将理解力从信除去，就看不到这些幻想了；但是，要知道，凡将理解力从信除去的人，都会将上千个幻想强加到每一个宗教信条上，正如数个世纪以来罗马天主教所做的那样。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 451</h4><p>451. And the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions. This symbolizes their delusions with respect to faith alone, as though they had power.<p>Heads symbolize the fanciful and illusory ideas that these people have regarding faith alone, which are the subject here, and for which we use the single term delusions. Horses symbolize the reasonings in the interiors of their minds, which are of this character (no. <a href="449.htm">449</a>). Lions symbolize power (no. <a href="241.htm">241</a>). It is a power based on fallacies, because these people are sense-oriented, and sense-oriented people base their reasoning on fallacies, which they use to persuade and captivate (no. <a href="424.htm">424</a>).</p><p>[2] That their arguments in defense of faith alone are fanciful and illusory is something everyone can see who elevates his mind to some degree. What is faith in practice or faith as a condition but something illusory according to their notion of them? Who among them knows anything about putting faith into practice? And what constitutes faith as a condition when nothing good enters from the person into a faith in practice?<p>What is an instantaneous forgiveness of sins and consequent salvation but an illusory idea of the imagination? It is the "fiery flying serpent" <sup>1</sup>in the church, as may be seen in <a href="../dp/340.htm">Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Providence 340</a>.<p>An attribution of immunity, merit, righteousness, and sanctification by imputation - what are these but illusory notions? See <a href="../lord/18.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord 18</a>.</p><p>[3] What else is a Divine operation in someone's internal constituents without the person's cooperation as though of himself in external actions? For the idea that an internal condition can be divorced from its external expression, so that there is no conjunction of the two, is nothing but an illusory notion. See no. <a href="606.htm">606</a> below.<p>Faith divorced from charity is such an illusory notion, for charity expressed in works contains and supports faith. It is its soil and ground, its essence and life. In a word, faith arising from charity is the real person; but faith divorced from charity is a mirage, and a figment of the imagination, like a bubble floating in the air.<p>But perhaps someone will say, "If you detach the intellect from faith, you will not see any illusions." However, he should know that if he can detach the intellect from faith, he can also impose on any religious tenet a thousand illusory notions, as Roman Catholics have done for centuries.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="3927/isaiah_14_29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_30_6.htm">30:6</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 451</h4><p>451. 'And the heads of the horses as the heads of lions' signifies the phantasies concerning faith alone as though it were powerful. By 'the heads' are signified the imaginary and visionary things concerning faith alone with them, of which it here treats, and these in one word are called phantasies. By 'the horses' are signified the reasonings of the interiors of their mind, which are such (<a href="449.htm">449</a>); by 'lions' power is signified (<a href="241.htm">241</a>). It is a power derived from fallacies, because they are sensual, and the sensual derive their reasoning from fallacies, by which means they persuade and captivate (<a href="424.htm">424</a>).</p><p>[2] That their arguments in favour of faith alone are imaginary and visionary, anyone who elevates his mind a little can see. What are faith in act and faith in its state, according to their idea, if not visionary? Which of them knows anything concerning faith in act, and what makes faith in its state, when nothing of good enters from a man into faith in act? What is the remission of sins and the resulting instantaneous salvation but a thing of visionary thought? That it is a fiery flying serpent in the Church, may be seen in <a href="../dp/340.htm">ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE PROVIDENCE 340</a>. What is the value of immunity, merit, justice, and holiness arising from imputation, except a visionary thing? Let <a href="../lord/18.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord 18</a>) be seen.</p><p>[3] What is Divine operation in internal things without man's co-operation in externals as from himself? For to separate internal from external, so that there is no conjunction, is purely visionary, as may be seen below (<a href="606.htm">606</a>). Such a visionary thing is faith separated from charity, for the charity in works is the containant and foundation of faith; it is the ground and land thereof, as well as the essence and life. In a word, faith derived from charity is the man, but faith without charity is a ghost, and is an imaginary entity of [theoretical] reason, like a bubble of water flying in the air. But perhaps someone is about to say, If you take understanding away from faith you will not see visionary things; but let it be known that he who can take understanding away from faith can also thrust a thousand visionary things upon every religious tenet, as has been done for ages past by the Roman Catholics. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 451</h4><p>451. And the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions, signifies fantasies concerning faith alone, as if it were in power. By "heads" are signified the imaginary and visionary things with them about faith alone, which are here treated of, and which in one word are called fantasies. By "horses" are signified the reasonings of the interiors of their minds, which are such, (<a href="449.htm">449</a>); by "lions" are signified power, (<a href="241.htm">241</a>); but it is power from fallacies, because they are sensual, and the sensual reason from fallacies, by which they persuade and captivate, (<a href="424.htm">424</a>).</p><p>[2] That their arguments in favor of faith alone are imaginary and visionary, anyone may see who elevates his mind a little. What are faith in act and faith in state, as conceived by them, but visionary things? Who is there among them that knows anything concerning faith in act; and what avails faith in state, when no good enters from man into faith in act. What is remission of sins and consequent instantaneous salvation, but a result of visionary thought? That it is "a fiery flying serpent" in the church, see The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Providence, (<a href="340.htm">340</a>). What is the conceit of immunity, merit, justice, and holiness from imputation, but visionary things? see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord, (<a href="18.htm">18</a>).</p><p>[3] What is the Divine operation in internals, without man's cooperation in externals as from himself? For to separate the internal from the external so that there can be no conjunction of them, is merely visionary (see below, <a href="606.htm">606</a>). Such a visionary thing is faith separated from charity; for charity in works is the containant and foundation of faith; it is its ground and earth, also its essence and life; in a word, faith from charity is the man; but faith, without charity, is a specter, and a creature of the imagination, like a bubble of water floating in the air. But perhaps some may say, If you remove the understanding from faith, you will not see visionary things; but be it known, that he who can remove the understanding from faith, may obtrude a thousand visionary things upon every religious tenet, as has been done for ages past by the Roman Catholics. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 451 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>451. "Et capita equorum sicut capita leonum;" significat phantasias de sola fide tanquam in potentia. - Per "capita" significantur imaginaria et visionaria de sola fide apud illos de quibus hic agitur, quae una voce vocantur phantasiae; per "equos" significantur ratiocinia interiorum mentis illorum, quae talia sunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_451/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_449" target=_top>449</a>); per "leones" significatur potentia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_451/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_241" target=_top>241</a>); quod sit potentia ex fallaciis, est quia sensuales sunt, et sensuales ratiocinantur ex fallaciis, per quas persuadent et captant (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_451/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_424" target=_top>424</a>). Quod argumentationes illorum pro sola fide sint imaginariae et visionariae, quisque qui aliquantum elevat mentem potest videre; quid fides actu et fides statu, secundum illorum ideam, nisi visionaria; quis ex illis scit aliquid de fide actu, et quid facit fides in statu, cum nihil boni ingreditur ab homine in fidem actu: quid remissio peccatorum et inde salvatio momentanea, nisi cogitationis visionariae; quod sit "prester volans" in Ecclesia, videatur in Sapientia Angelica de <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_451/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_340" target=_top>Divina Providentia 340</a>; quid reputatio immunitatis, meriti, justitiae, sanctitatis ex imputatione, nisi visionaria; videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_451/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_18" target=_top>Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 18</a>. Quid Divina operatio in internis absque cooperatione hominis in externis sicut ab illo; separare enim internum ab externo ut non sit conjunctio, est mere visionarium, videatur infra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_451/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_606" target=_top>606</a>). Tale visionarium est fides separata a charitate; charitas enim in operibus est fidei continens et firmamentum, est ejus humus et terra, tum essentia et vita; verbo fides ex charitate est homo, fides autem absque charitate est larva, et est ens imaginativum rationis, simile bullae aqueae volanti in aere. Sed forte quis dicturus est, si removes Intellectum a fide, non visurus es visionaria; at sciat, quod qui potest removere intellectum a fide, potest etiam cuivis religioso obtrudere mille visionaria, ut factum est a saeculis retro a Romano Catholicis. </p>
