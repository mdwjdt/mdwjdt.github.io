<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第554节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>554.“因为那在我们神面前昼夜控告我们弟兄的，已经被摔下去了”表那些反对新教会教义的人通过最后的审判而被移除。龙“被摔下去”表示“龙”所指的那些人被移除了，即他们从天上被摔到灵人界，然后摔进地狱，这就是对他们的最后审判，如前所述。“弟兄”表示那些处于新耶路撒冷的教义并照之生活的人。“控告”表示反对这教义，坚持认为它是虚假的，叫嚷着要反对它；由于他们仿佛在神面前不断这样行，所以“龙”被称为“那在我们神面前昼夜控告我们弟兄的”。魔鬼在试探时，也是这么做的，因为他从人里面提取出各种他称之为虚假的事物并进行谴责。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 554</h4><p>554. For the accuser of our brethren, which accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down. This symbolically means that by the Last Judgment those were removed who stood in opposition to the doctrine of the New Church.<p>The dragon's being cast down means, symbolically, that those meant by the dragon were removed. They were removed by being cast down from heaven into the world of spirits, as we said before, and after that into hell, which was the Last Judgment on them. Brethren mean people who have the doctrine of the New Jerusalem and live in accordance with it. To accuse means, symbolically, to stand in opposition to a doctrine, to charge that it is false, and to expostulate against it. And because those meant by the dragon do this continually as though before God, the dragon is called the accuser of our brethren which accused them before God day and night.<p>The devil does this, too, whenever it tempts or subjects to trial, for it draws out various thoughts from a person which it labels as false and condemns. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 554</h4><p>554. Because the accuser of our brothers has been cast out, accusing them before our God day and night' signifies that those who have taken a position against the doctrine of the New Church have been removed by means of the last judgment. The dragon's having been cast out signifies that those who are understood by 'the dragon' have been removed, that they have been removed by a casting down out of heaven into the world of spirits and then into hell, and that this is their last judgment. This has been said before. By 'brothers' those are understood who are in the doctrine of the New Jerusalem and in a life in accordance with it. By 'to accuse' is signified to take a position against the doctrine, to prove that it is untrue, and to censure it, and because they are doing this continually, as if before God, the dragon is termed 'the accuser of the brothers accusing them before God day and night.' This also the Devil does when he is tempting, for he drags forth various things out of a man, which he calls untrue and condemns. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 554</h4><p>554. For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, that accused them before our God day and night, signifies that by the Last Judgment they are removed who opposed the doctrine of the New Jerusalem. By the dragon "being cast down" is signified that they were removed who are meant by "the dragon;" that they were removed by being cast down from heaven into the world of spirits, and then into hell, which is their Last Judgment, was said before. By "brethren" are meant they who are the doctrine of the New Jerusalem, and in a life according to it; by "accusing" is signified to oppose the doctrine, to maintain that it is false, and to cry out against it; and because they do this continually, as it were before God, the dragon is called "the accuser of our brethren, accusing them before God day and night." This also the devil does when he tempts, for he brings forth various things out of man, which he calls falsities, and condemns. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 554 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>554. "Quia projectus est accusator fratrum nostrorum, accusans illos coram Deo nostro dies et noctes," significat quod per Ultimum Judicium remoti sint, qui se opposuerunt contra doctrinam Novae Hierosolymae. Quod Draco "projectus sit" significat quod remoti sint qui per "Draconem" intelliguntur; quod remoti sint per dejectionem e Caelo in Mundum spirituum, et dein in Infernum, quod est ultimum illorum judicium, prius dictum est; per "fratres" intelliguntur qui in doctrina Novae Hierosolymae et in vita secundum illam sunt: per "accusare" significatur se opponere contra doctrinam, illam arguere falsi, et objurgare; et quia hoc continue faciunt sicut coram Deo, dicitur Draco "accusator fratrum accusans illos coram Deo dies et noctes:" hoc quoque facit Diabolus cum tentat; protrahit enim varia ex homine, quae vocat falsa, et condemnat. </p>
