<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第494节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>494.启11:5.“若有人想要害他们，就有火从他们口中出来，烧灭仇敌”表凡想要摧毁新教会的这两大基本要素的人必因地狱之爱而灭亡。“若有人想要害这两个见证人”表示想要摧毁新教会的这两大基本要素，就是承认主是天地之神，甚至在祂的人性方面也是，并照十诫生活；这些就是“他们”，即两个见证人（参看<a href="490.htm">490</a>节）。“有火从他们口中出来”表示地狱之爱；“吞灭他们的仇敌”表示害他们的人必因地狱之爱而灭亡；不过，在此不要以为“火”要从两个见证人口中发出来，而是要从那些想要摧毁“两个见证人”所表示的新教会两大基本要素（<a href="490.htm">490</a>节）的人口中发出来。“火”是指地狱之爱；因为人若不照十诫生活，不靠近神救主、救世主，必陷入地狱之爱而灭亡。</p><p>这话和圣言中其它地方所说的话很相似，如有火从耶和华发出烧灭恶人，耶和华出于怒火、忿怒、烈怒等行事；此外还有其它类似表述，这些话不是说这一切出于耶和华，而出于恶人的地狱之爱。圣言之所以提到这类事，是因为它们是表象；圣言就字义而言，是由对应和表象写成的。由于经上说“有火从他们口中出来”，并且这句话的意思是说，这火来自那些陷入地狱之爱的人，故有必要引用一些提到“火来自耶和华”的经文：</p><p>耶和华的气如一股硫磺火使它着起来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.33.htm">30:33</a>）</p><p>浓烟从祂的鼻孔往上冒，烈火从祂的口中喷出来，连炭也烧着了。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.8.htm">18:8</a>）</p><p>我要将我的恼怒，就是我的烈怒，都倾在他们身上。我的忿怒如火，必烧灭全地。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番3.8.htm">3:8</a>）</p><p>看哪，耶和华必在火中降临，祂以烈怒施行报应，以火焰施行责罚。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.15.htm">66:15</a>）</p><p>耶和华必用吞灭的火焰向你讨罪。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.6.htm">29:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.30.htm">30:30</a>）</p><p>此外还有其它许多地方。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 494</h4><p>494. And if anyone wants to harm them, fire will proceed from their mouth and devour their enemies. (<a href="3927/revelation_11_5.htm">11:5</a>) This symbolically means that anyone who wishes to destroy these two essential elements perishes from a hellish love.<p>To want to harm the two witnesses means, symbolically, to wish to destroy the two essential elements of the New Church, namely, an acknowledgment of the Lord as being God of heaven and earth even as to His humanity, and a life in accordance with the Ten Commandments. To be shown that these are the two witnesses, see no. <a href="490.htm">490</a> above.<p>Fire's proceeding from their mouth means, symbolically, that hellish love will do so; and its devouring their enemies means, symbolically, that those who harm them will perish because of it. Here, however, it is not to be supposed that fire will issue from the mouth of the witnesses, but that it will do so from people who wish to destroy these two essential elements of the New Church, meant by the two witnesses (no. <a href="490.htm">490</a>). The fire is the fire of hell; for people who do not live according to the Ten Commandments, and who do not turn to God, their Savior and Redeemer, cannot help but be caught up in a hellish love and perish.</p><p>[2] The case is the same as elsewhere in the Word where we are told that Jehovah sends fire that consumes the wicked, or that Jehovah does other things like that out of the fire of His wrath, anger, or fury, which mean not that they come from Jehovah, but that they do so from the hellish love of the wicked.<p>We read of instances like that in the Word because that is how they appear, and the Word in its literal sense was composed in terms of appearances and things that correspond.<p>Since we are told that fire proceeded from their mouth, and this means that it originated from people caught up in a hellish love, we will cite some passages where fire is said to issue from Jehovah:<p>The breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone, will consume it. (<a href="3927/isaiah_30_33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>)<p>Smoke went up from His nostrils, and fire from His mouth...; coals were kindled by it. (<a href="3927/psalms_18_8.htm">Psalms 18:8</a>)<p>(I will) pour out on them... the wrath of My anger; for all the earth shall be devoured in the fire of My zeal. (<a href="3927/zephaniah_3_8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a>)<p>...behold, Jehovah will come with fire... for retribution in the wrath of His anger, and His rebuke in flames of fire. (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>)<p>You will be visited by Jehovah... with the flame of devouring fire. (<a href="3927/isaiah_29_6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>, cf. <a href="3927/isaiah_30_30.htm">30:30</a>)<p>And so on in many places elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 494</h4><p>494. [verse 5] 'And if any one wishes to hurt them, fire shall go forth out of their mouth, and shall devour their enemies' signifies that he who wishes to destroy these two Essentials of the New Church perishes as the result of infernal love. 'To wish to hurt the two witnesses' signifies to wish to destroy the two Essentials of the New Church, which are the acknowledgment of the Lord as being the God of heaven and earth even as to the Human, and a life in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue. That these are 'the witnesses' may be seen above (<a href="490.htm">490</a>). 'Fire shall go forth out of their mouth' signifies that [there is] infernal love; 'and shall devour their enemies' signifies that those who harm them are going to perish as the result of that love. Here, however, it is not to be understood that fire is going to issue forth out of the mouth of the witnesses, but that it is from those who wish to destroy the two Essentials of the New Church, which are understood by 'the witnesses' (<a href="490.htm">490</a>). The 'fire' is infernal love, for he who does not live in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue and does not come to God the Saviour and Redeemer cannot but be in infernal love and perish.</p><p>[2] This is similar to its being said elsewhere in the Word that there is a fire from Jehovah that consumes the wicked, and that Jehovah does things by reason of the fire of His growing anger, wrath and fury, besides other like things, by which it is not understood that [this comes] from Jehovah, but that it is from the infernal love of the wicked. Such things are said in the Word because they are appearances, and the Word in the sense of the letter has been composed by means of appearances and correspondences. Since it is said that 'fire' should 'go forth out of their mouth,' and thereby it is understood that it is out of those who are in infernal love, some passages shall be quoted where 'fire' is said to come out of Jehovah:<p>The breath of Jehovah like a stream of sulphur shall consume it. <a href="3927/isaiah_30_33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>.<p>There went up smoke out of His nose, and fire out of his mouth; coals burned as a result of this. <a href="3927/psalms_18_8.htm">Psalms 18:8</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_18_9.htm">9</a>].<p>I will pour out upon them the growing anger of My wrath, for in the fire of My zeal the whole land shall be eaten up, <a href="3927/zephaniah_3_8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a>.<p>Behold Jehovah shall come in fire, for retribution in the growing anger of His wrath, and His rebuke in flames of fire. <a href="3927/isaiah_66_15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>.<p>Thou shalt be visited by Jehovah with aflame of devouring fire. <a href="3927/isaiah_29_6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_30_30.htm">30:30</a>; besides many elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 494</h4><p>494. Verse 5. And if anyone will hurt them, fire shall go forth out of their mouth, and shall devour their enemies, signifies that they who would destroy these two essentials of the new church will perish from infernal love. "To will to hurt the two witnesses" signifies to will to destroy these two essentials of the New Church, which are the acknowledgment of the Lord that He is the God of heaven and earth even as to the Human, and a life according to the precepts of the Decalogue; that these are "the witnesses" may be seen above, (<a href="490.htm">490</a>). "Fire shall go forth out their mouth" signifies infernal love; "and shall devour their enemies" signifies that they who hurt them will perish from that love; but it is not here to be understood that fire will proceed "out of the mouth of the witnesses," but from those who would destroy these two essentials of the New Church, which are meant by "the witnesses" (<a href="490.htm">490</a>). "Fire" is infernal love; for he who does not live according to the precepts of the Decalogue, and who does not approach to God the Savior and Redeemer, cannot be otherwise than in infernal love, and perish.</p><p>[2] This is similar to what is said elsewhere in the Word, that from Jehovah there is "fire which consumes the wicked;" and that Jehovah acts "from the fire of his wrath," "anger," and "fury;" besides other similar expressions, by which it is not meant that this comes from Jehovah, but from the infernal love of the wicked. Such things are said in the Word, because they are appearances; and the Word, in its literal sense, is written by correspondences and appearances. Since it is said that "fire should go forth out of their mouth" and that thereby is meant that it is from those who are in infernal love, some passages shall be adduced in which it is said that "fire is from Jehovah":<p>The breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone, shall consume it, (<a href="3927/isaiah_30_33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>).<p>Smoke goeth up out of His nostrils, and fire out of His mouth, coals burned from it, (<a href="3927/psalms_18_8.htm">Psalms 18:8</a>).<p>I will pour out upon them the wrath of Mine anger, for in the fire of My zeal shall the whole earth be consumed, (<a href="3927/zephaniah_3_8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a>).<p>Behold, Jehovah shall come in fire, for retribution in the wrath of His anger, and His rebuke in flames of fire, (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>).<p>Thou shalt be visited by Jehovah in a flame of devouring fire, (<a href="3927/isaiah_29_6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_30_30.htm">30:30</a>; besides many elsewhere). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 494 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>494. (Vers. 5.) "Et si quis illis voluerit nocere, ignis exibit ex ore illorum, et devorabit inimicos illorum," significat quod qui bina illa Essentialia Novae Ecclesiae vult destruere, ex amore infernali pereat. - "Binis Testibus velle nocere" significat bina illa Essentialia Novae Ecclesiae, quae sunt Agnitio Domini quod sit Deus Caeli et Terrae etiam quoad Humanum, et Vita secundum praecepta Decalogi, velle destruere; quod "testes" illa sint, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_494/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490" target=_top>490</a>). "Ignis egredietur ex ore illorum" significat quod amor infernalis; "et devorabit inimicos illorum" significat quod ex illo perituri sint, qui illis nocent; sed hic non intelligendum est, quod ignis "ex ore testium" egressurus sit, sed quod ab illis qui duo illa Essentialia Ecclesiae Novae, quae per "testes" intelliguntur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_494/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490" target=_top>490</a>), volunt destruere; "ignis" est amor infernalis; nam qui non secundum praecepta Decalogi vivit, et non adit Deum Salvatorem et Redemptorem, non potest aliter quam in amore infernali esse, et perire. Hoc simile est sicut alibi in Verbo, ubi dicitur quod a Jehovah sit "Ignis qui consumit impios;" et quod Jehovah "ex igne excandescentiae," "irae," et "furoris" faciat; praeter similia alia; per quae non intelligitur quod a Jehovah, sed quod ab impiorum amore infernali. Talia in Verbo dicuntur, quia sunt apparentiae, et Verbum in Sensu literae per Apparentias et Correspondentias conscriptum est. Quoniam dicitur, quod "ignis exiret ex ore illorum," et quod per id intelligatur, quod ex illis qui in amore infernali sunt, adducentur aliqua loca, ubi dicitur "ignis ex Jehovah:" <p>"Flatus Jehovae sicut fluvius sulphuris consumet eum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_494/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_30_33" target=_top>Esajas 30:33</a>), <p>"Ascendit fumus ex naso Ejus, et Ignis ex ore Ejus, prunae arserunt ex Eo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_494/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_18_9" target=_top>Psalm 18:9</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_494/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_18_8" target=_top>8</a>));<p>Effundam super eos excandescentiam irae Meae, quoniam in Igne Zeli Mei comedetur tota terra," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_494/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zephaniah_3_8" target=_top>Zephanias 3:8</a>);<p>"Ecce Jehovah in Igne veniet, ad retribuendum in excandescentia irae Suae, et increpatio Ejus in flammis Ignis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_494/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_66_15" target=_top>Esaias 66:15</a>);<p>"Visitaberis a Jehovah flamma Ignis comedentis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_494/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_29_6" target=_top>Esaias 29:6</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_494/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_30_30" target=_top>30:30</a>).<p>(Praeter pluries alibi.) </p>
