<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第921节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>921.“地上的君王必将自己的荣耀、尊贵归与那城”表所有处于源自属灵良善的智慧之真理的人都将在那里称谢主，并将他们所具有的一切真理和一切良善都归给祂。“地上的君王”表示那些处于来自主源于良善的真理之人（<a href="20.htm">20</a>，<a href="854.htm">854</a>节），故在此表示那些处于源自属灵之爱的良善的智慧之真理的人，因为首先提到的“列族”表示那些处于属天之爱的良善之人，如前一节所述。“必将荣耀、尊贵归与那城”，即归与新耶路撒冷，表示称谢主，并将他们所具有的一切真理和一切良善都归给主。“必将荣耀、尊贵归与”表示这些事（<a href="249.htm">249</a>，<a href="629.htm">629</a>，<a href="693.htm">693</a>节），因为“荣耀”论及神性真理，“尊贵”论及神性良善，论及主（<a href="249.htm">249</a>节）。“列族”和“君王”与前面（<a href="483.htm">483</a>节）所论述的“民族和人民”所表相同，“民族”表示那些处于爱之良善的人，“人民”表示那些处于智慧之真理的人，它们也有反面意义。因此，在圣言的许多地方，它们被称为“列族（即诸民族）和君王（或译为王）”，正如它们在以下经文被称为“民族（或译为众族、列族）和人民（或译为百姓，万民，列民，众民等）”一样：</p><p>众王都要叩拜祂，众族都要侍奉祂。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.11.htm">72:11</a>）</p><p>你也必吃列族的奶，又吮众王的乳房。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.16.htm">60:16</a>）</p><p>因为有许多民族和大君王必使他们服侍。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.14.htm">25:14</a>）</p><p>在你右手边的主在祂发烈怒的日子，必打伤列王，祂要在列族中审判。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗110.5.htm">110:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗110.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>此外还有其它地方。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 921</h4><p>921. And the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honor into it. This symbolically means that all those people who possess truths of wisdom springing from spiritual goodness will in the New Church confess the Lord and attribute to Him all the truth and all the goodness that they possess.<p>Kings of the earth symbolize people governed by truths that spring from a goodness received from the Lord (nos. <a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="854.htm">854</a>). Here, therefore, they are people impelled by truths of wisdom springing from the goodness of a spiritual love, because nations are mentioned first, which symbolize people impelled by the goodness of a celestial love, as described in the previous number. To bring their glory and honor into the city, or into the New Jerusalem, means, symbolically, to confess the Lord and attribute to Him all the truth and goodness that they possess. That this is the symbolic meaning of bringing or giving glory and honor, see nos. <a href="249.htm">249</a>, <a href="629.htm">629</a>, <a href="693.htm">693</a>. For glory is mentioned in reference to the Lord's Divine truth, and honor in reference to His Divine goodness (no. <a href="249.htm">249</a>).<p>Nations and kings have the same symbolic meaning as nations and peoples, as explained in no. <a href="483.htm">483</a> above, nations symbolizing people impelled by the goodness of love, and peoples those who are impelled by truths of wisdom. The same is the case also in an opposite sense. Consequently nations and kings are mentioned as frequently in the Word as nations and peoples, as in the following places:<p>All kings shall prostrate themselves before Him, and all nations shall serve Him. (<a href="3927/psalms_72_11.htm">Psalms 72:11</a>)<p>You shall suck the milk of nations, and suck the nipples of kings. (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_16.htm">Isaiah 60:16</a>)<p>...many nations and great kings shall make them serve... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>)<p>The Lord at Your right hand shall smite kings in the day of His wrath. He shall judge among the nations... (<a href="3927/psalms_110_5.htm">Psalms 110:5-6</a>)<p>And so on elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 921</h4><p>921. 'And the kings of the land shall bring their glory and honour into it' signifies that all who are in truths of wisdom derived from spiritual good will confess the Lord there and ascribe to Him all the truth and all the good that are with them. By 'the kings of the land' are signified those who are in truths derived from good from the Lord (<a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="854.htm">854</a>), here therefore those who are in truths of wisdom derived from the good of spiritual love, because 'the nations' are mentioned first, by which are signified those who are in the good of celestial love, treated of in the preceding paragraph. By 'to bring glory and honour into it,' or into the New Jerusalem, is signified to confess the Lord and to ascribe to Him all the truth and all the good that are with them. That these things are signified by 'to bring and give glory and honour' may be seen (<a href="249.htm">249</a>, <a href="629.htm">629</a>, <a href="693.htm">693</a>), for 'glory' is predicated of the Divine Truth, and 'honour' of the Divine Good, of the Lord (<a href="249.htm">249</a>). By 'the nations' and 'the kings' similar things are signified as by the' nations and peoples' treated of above (<a href="483.htm">483</a>), by 'nations' those who are in the good of love and by 'peoples' those who are in the truths of wisdom; also in the opposite sense. Therefore in different places in the Word they are termed 'nations and kings,' just as they are termed 'nations and peoples,' as in these places:<p>All kings shall bow down to Him, and all nations shall serve Him. <a href="3927/psalms_72_11.htm">Psalms 72:11</a>.<p>Thou shalt suck the milk of the nations, and shalt suck the breasts of kings. <a href="3927/isaiah_60_16.htm">Isaiah 60:16</a>.<p>Many nations and great kings shall make them serve. <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>.<p>The Lord at thy right hand has smitten kings in the day of wrath, He has judged between the nations. <a href="3927/psalms_110_5.htm">Psalms 110:5-6</a>; besides elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 921</h4><p>921. And the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honor into it, signifies that all who are in the truths of wisdom from spiritual good, will there confess the Lord, and ascribe to Him every truth and every good that is with them. By "the kings of the earth" are signified they who are in truths from good from the Lord, (<a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="854.htm">854</a>); here, therefore, they who are in the truths of wisdom from the good of spiritual love, because "the nations" are mentioned before, by which are signified they who are in the good of celestial love, of whom in the foregoing article; by "bringing glory and honor into it," or into the New Jerusalem, is signified to confess the Lord, and ascribe to Him all the truth and good which are with them; that this is what is signified by bringing and giving "glory and honor" may be seen, (<a href="249.htm">249</a>, <a href="629.htm">629</a>[1-2], <a href="693.htm">693</a>), for "glory" is predicated of the Divine truth, and "honor" of the Divine good of the Lord, (<a href="249.htm">249</a>). By "nations and kings" the same is signified as by "nations and peoples" mentioned above, (<a href="483.htm">483</a>), by "nations" they who are in the good of love, and by "peoples" they who are in the truths of wisdom, and also in the opposite sense. Therefore in many parts of the Word "nations and kings" are mentioned, as well as "nations and peoples," as in the following passages:<p>All kings shall bow down to Him, and all nations shall serve Him, (<a href="3927/psalms_72_11.htm">Psalms 72:11</a>).<p>Thou shalt suck the milk of the nations, and thou shalt suck the breast of kings, (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_16.htm">Isaiah 60:16</a>).<p>For many nations and great kings shall make them serve, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>).<p>The Lord at thy right hand shall smite kings in the day of His anger, He shall judge among the nations, (<a href="3927/psalms_110_5.htm">Psalms 110:5-6</a>), besides other places. </p>

Per "gentes et reges" similia significantur quae per "gentes et populos" (de quibus supra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_921/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_483" target=_top>483</a>); per "gentes" illi qui in bono amoris sunt, et per "populos" qui in veris sapientiae sunt; etiam in opposito sensu: quare in Verbo passim dicuntur "gentes et reges," sicut dicuntur "gentes et populi," ut in his: <p>"Incurvabunt se Illi omnes Reges, et omnes Gentes servient illi," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_921/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_72_11" target=_top>Psalm 72:11</a>);<p>"Suges lac Gentium, et ubera Regum suges," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_921/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_60_16" target=_top>Esaias 60:16</a>);<p>"Servire facient eos Gentes multae, et Reges magni," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_921/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_25_14" target=_top>Jeremias 25:14</a>);<p>"Dominus ad dextram tuam percussit in die irae Reges, judicavit inter Gentes," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_921/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_110_5-6" target=_top>Psalm 110:5-6</a>). <sup>1</sup><p>(Praeter alibi.) <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;cx. pro "xc." </p>
