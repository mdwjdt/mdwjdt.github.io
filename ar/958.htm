<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第958节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>958.启22:19.“这书上预言的话，若有人删去什么，神必从生命册，从圣城和这书上所写的事删去他的分”表那些阅读并知道主如今所打开这本书的教义真理，却依旧认别神超过主，认别信超过对祂的信之人若拿走什么导致这二者被毁，就无法从圣言获得智慧，也无法吸收来自圣言的任何东西，也不会被接进新耶路撒冷，在那些处于主国度的人当中也没有他们的份。这些话与上述话所表相同，只是此处论到那些“删去什么”的人，而那里论及那些“加添什么”的人，因此论及的是那些要么通过加添，要么通过删去毁灭这两个真理的人。“从生命册删去他的分”表示他们无法从圣言获得任何智慧，也通过圣言吸收任何东西。“生命册”是指圣言，也指圣言方面的主（<a href="256.htm">256</a>，<a href="469.htm">469</a>，<a href="874.htm">874</a>，<a href="925.htm">925</a>节）。原因在于，主就是圣言；事实上，圣言唯独论述祂，这一点在《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》和《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》已经充分说明；所以那些不直接靠近主的人无法从圣言看到任何真理。“从圣城删去他的分”表示从新教会，也就是圣耶路撒冷；因为若不单单靠近主，没有人被接进圣耶路撒冷。“从这书中所写的事删去他的分”表示在那些处于主国度的人当中没有他们的份，因为写在这书的一切事皆关注以构成主国度为目的的新天堂和新教会，这个目的就是写在这书上的一切事所指向的目的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 958</h4><p>958. <a href="3927/revelation_22_19.htm">22:19</a> And if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. This symbolically means that people who read and know the doctrinal truths in this book now laid open by the Lord, and yet acknowledge some other God than the Lord, and some other faith than faith in the Lord, by taking away something in order to destroy these two tenets, cannot perceive or acquire for themselves anything from the Word or be received into the New Jerusalem, or have their lot with people in the Lord's kingdom.<p>The symbolic meaning here is similar to that above, only here it applies to people who take away from these words, while there it applies to people who add to them. The warning accordingly applies to people who, either by adding to them or taking away from them, destroy these two truths.<p>To take away a person's part from the Book of Life means, symbolically, that it is impossible for him to perceive or assimilate into himself anything from the Word. The Book of Life is the Word, and also the Lord in relation to the Word (nos. <a href="256.htm">256</a>, <a href="469.htm">469</a>, <a href="874.htm">874</a>, <a href="925.htm">925</a>). That is because the Lord embodies the Word, for the Word has the Lord alone as its subject, as we have fully shown in two Doctrines of the New Jerusalem, one Regarding the Lord, and the other Regarding the Sacred Scripture. Therefore people who do not turn directly to the Lord cannot see any truth emerging from the Word.<p>To take away a person's part from the holy city means, symbolically, from the New Church, the Holy Jerusalem. For no one is accepted into it who does not turn to the Lord alone.<p>To take away a person's part from the things which are written in this book means, symbolically, that he does not have his lot with people in the Lord's kingdom. For everything written in this book looks forward to a new heaven and a new church, which constitute the Lord's kingdom, as the end result, and the end result is that to which everything written in the book has relation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 958</h4><p>958. [verse 19] 'And if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and the things written in this book' signifies that those who read and know the truths of the doctrine of this book now opened by the Lord, and go on acknowledging a God other than the Lord, and a faith other than directed to Him, by taking away anything by which they may destroy these two, cannot be wise in and appropriate to themselves anything out of the Word, nor be received into the New Jerusalem, nor have their lot with those who are in the Lord's kingdom. Similar things are signified by these words as by those above, only that here it is said of those who take away and there of those who add, consequently of those who either by adding or by taking away destroy those two truths. By 'to take away [his] part out of the book of life' is signified that they cannot be wise in or appropriate to themselves anything out of the Word, 'the book of life' being the Word and also the Lord as to the Word (<a href="256.htm">256</a>, <a href="469.htm">469</a>, <a href="874.htm">874</a>, <a href="925.htm">925</a>). This is because the Lord is the Word, for the Word treats of Him Only, as has been fully shown in the TWO DOCTRINES OF THE NEW JERUSALEM, the one CONCERNING THE LORD and the other CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE, and therefore those who do not approach the Lord directly cannot see any truth out of the Word. By 'to take away [his] part out of the holy city' is signified out of the New Church, which is the holy Jerusalem. For into that Church no one is received who does not approach the Only Lord. By 'to take away [his] part out of the things written in this book' is signified not to have their lot with those who are in the Lord's kingdom, for all the things that have been written in this book regard as the end a new Heaven and a new Church, which make the Lord's kingdom, and the end is that to which all the things that are written in the book have relation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 958</h4><p>958. Verse 19. And if anyone shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and the things which are written in this book, signifies that they who read and know the truths of doctrine in this book, now opened by the Lord, and yet acknowledge any other God than the Lord, and any other faith than a faith in Him, by taking away anything whereby they may destroy these two things, cannot acquire any wisdom, nor appropriate to themselves anything from the Word, nor be received into the New Jerusalem, nor have their lot with those who are in the Lord's kingdom. These words signify the same as the foregoing, only that here it is said of those who take away, and there of those who add, consequently of those who either by adding or taking away, destroy those two truths. "To take away their part out of the book of life," signifies that they cannot acquire any wisdom from the Word, nor appropriate anything out of it to themselves. "The book of life" is the Word, and also the Lord as to the Word, (<a href="256.htm">256</a>, <a href="469.htm">469</a>, <a href="874.htm">874</a>, <a href="925.htm">925</a>). The reason is, because the Lord is the Word, for the Word treats of Him alone, as is fully shown in the Two Doctrines of the New Jerusalem, one concerning, Doctrine of the Lord, and the other concerning Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture; wherefore they who do not immediately approach the Lord cannot see any truth from the Word. "To take away their part out of the holy city," signifies out of the New Church, which is the holy Jerusalem; for no one is received into it who does not approach the Lord alone. "To take away their part out of the things which are written in this book," signifies not to have their lot with those who are in the Lord's kingdom, for all the things which are written in this book regard the New Heaven and the New Church, which make the Lord's kingdom as the end, and the end is that to which all the things which are written in the book have reference. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 958 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>958. (Vers. 19.) "Et si quis abstulerit e verbis Libri prophetiae hujus, auferet Deus partem ejus e Libro vitae, et ex Urbe sancta, et scriptus in Libro hoc," significat quod qui legunt et sciunt vera doctrinae hujus Libri nunc a Domino aperti, et usque agnoscunt alium Deum quam Dominum, et aliam fidem quam in Ipsum, auferendo aliquid per quod illa duo destruant, non possint aliquid sapere et appropriare sibi ex Verbo, nec recipi in Nova Hierosolyma, neque habere sortem cum illis qui in Regno Domini sunt. -Per haec similia significantur quae supra, solum quod hic dicatur de illis qui auferunt, et ibi de illis qui addunt, proinde de illis qui vel addendo vel auferendo duo illa Vera destruunt; per "auferre partem e Libro vitae" significatur quod non possint aliquid sapere seu appropriare sibi ex Verbo; "Liber vitae" est Verbum et quoque Dominus quoad Verbum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_958/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_256" target=_top>256</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_958/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_469" target=_top>469</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_958/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_874" target=_top>874</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_958/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_925" target=_top>925</a>); causa est quia Dominus est Verbum; Verbum enim de Solo Ipso agit, ut in duabus Doctrinis Novae Hierosolymae, una de Domino, et altera de Scriptura Sacra, plene ostensum est; quare qui non Dominum immediate adeunt, non possunt videre aliquod verum ex Verbo: per "auferre partem ex Urbe sancta" significatur ex Nova Ecclesia, quae est sancta Hierosolyma; in illam enim nemo recipitur qui non solum Dominum adit: per "auferre partem ex scriptis in Libro hoc" significatur non sortem habere cum illis qui in Regno Domini sunt, nam omnia quae in Libro hoc scripta sunt, spectant novum Caelum et novam Ecclesiam, quae faciunt Regnum Domini, ut finem; et finis est, ad quem omnia quae scribuntur in Libro se referunt. </p>
