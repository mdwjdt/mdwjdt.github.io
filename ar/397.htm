<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>397.启8:6.“拿着七枝号的七位天使就预备要吹”表他们已预备妥当，要审查教会的状态，因而审查那些持唯信宗教信仰之人的生命状态。至于“号”表示什么，这从关于以色列人使用号的律例明显看出来，对此，摩西五经记着说：</p><p>耶和华晓谕摩西用银子做两枝号，用以招聚会众，并叫众营起行；在快乐的日子和节期，并月朔，献燔祭和平安祭，他们也要吹号；与欺压他们的敌人打仗，就要用号吹出大声，便在耶和华神面前得蒙纪念，也蒙拯救脱离仇敌。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.1.htm">10:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>从这些话可以看出“吹号”表示什么。此处“七位天使要号”表示审查并显示那些持唯信宗教信仰者当中的教会状态。这一点从以灵义来理解的本章细节，以及接下来直到第十六章的细节明显看出来。</p><p>从号筒或号角在以色列人中的用途也可看出以下经文中“号筒”和“吹号”或“吹角”表示什么：</p><p>你们要在锡安吹角，在圣山吹出大声，因为耶和华的日子将到。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.1.htm">2:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>耶和华（Jehovah）必显现在他们以上，祂的箭必射出如闪电，主耶和华（Jehovih）必吹角。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.14.htm">9:14</a>）</p><p>耶和华必像狮子出去，要喊叫。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.13.htm">42:13</a>）</p><p>当那日，必大发角声，在亚述地将要灭亡的，并在埃及地被赶散的，都要来，他们要在圣山上向耶和华下拜。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛27.13.htm">27:13</a>）</p><p>祂要差遣使者，使用号筒的大声，他们必将祂的选民从四风、从天这边到天那边，都招聚了来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.31.htm">24:31</a>）</p><p>知道欢呼的，那民是有福的；耶和华啊，他们在你脸上的光里行走。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.15.htm">89:15</a>）</p><p>那时，晨星一同歌唱，神的众子也都欢呼。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯38.7.htm">38:7</a>）</p><p>由于“吹号”或“吹角”表示这类事物，并且在以色列教会，一切事物都照着对应和由此而来的含义而活生生地呈现出来，所以才会发生下列事件：</p><p>当耶和华降临西乃山时，有声音、闪电和密云，并且角声非常强大，角声越来越强、大到极点，营中的百姓尽都发颤。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.16.htm">19:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.25.htm">25</a>）</p><p>因同样的缘故，还发生以下事件：</p><p>当三百人与基甸吹角攻击米甸人时，人的剑击杀他的同伴，他们就逃离了。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士7.16.htm">7:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/士7.22.htm">22</a>）</p><p>同样：</p><p>一万二千以色列人手里拿着圣所的器皿和号筒战胜米甸人。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民31.1.htm">31:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民31.8.htm">8</a>）</p><p>还有：</p><p>七个祭司拿七个羊角绕城七次后，耶利哥的城墙就塌陷了。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书6.1.htm">6:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书6.20.htm">20</a>）所以，在耶利米书，经上说：</p><p>要在巴比伦四围呐喊！她的城墙被拆毁了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.15.htm">50:15</a>）</p><p>西番雅书：</p><p>那日是黑暗幽冥的日子，是吹角呐喊的日子，要攻击坚固城。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.15.htm">1:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.16.htm">16</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 397</h4><p>397. And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. (<a href="3927/revelation_8_6.htm">8:6</a>) This symbolizes their being prepared and ready to examine the state of the church and consequent life in people for whom religion is faith alone.<p>The symbolism of trumpets follows from the statute governing their use among the children of Israel, which Moses describes in this way: Jehovah told Moses to make silver trumpets for summoning the assembly and for the setting out of the camps, and they were also to sound them on days of celebration, feasts, new moons, and over burnt offerings and sacrifices. Furthermore, when they went to war against enemies oppressing them, they were to sound an alarm with the trumpets, and then they would come into remembrance before Jehovah God and be saved from their enemies. (<a href="3927/numbers_10_1.htm">Numbers 10:1-10</a>)<p>It can be seen from this what sounding with trumpets symbolizes. Here, that the seven angels sounding symbolizes an examination and exposure of the state of the church and its character among people for whom religion is faith alone, as is apparent from the particulars in this chapter and from the particulars in the following chapters up to chapter 16 inclusive, understood in their spiritual sense.</p><p>[2] From the ways trumpets were used among the children of Israel it can also be seen what trumpets and sounding them symbolize in the following places:<p>Sound a trumpet in Zion, and sound it in My holy mountain! ...For the day of Jehovah is coming... (<a href="3927/joel_2_1.htm">Joel 2:1-2</a>)<p>Jehovah will be seen over them, and His arrow will go forth like lightning; and the Lord Jehovih will sound the ram's horn... (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_14.htm">Zechariah 9:14</a>)<p>Jehovah shall go forth like a lion... (and) sound an alarm... (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>)<p>...on that day a great ram's horn will be sounded, and those who perish in the land of Assyria, and those who are exiled in the land of Egypt, will come and bow themselves to Jehovah on the holy mountain... (<a href="3927/isaiah_27_13.htm">Isaiah 27:13</a>)<p>He will send His angels with the great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. (<a href="3927/matthew_24_31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>)<p>Blessed are the people who know the trumpet's sound! They walk, O Jehovah, in the light of Your countenance. (<a href="3927/psalms_89_15.htm">Psalms 89:15</a>)<p>When the morning stars sing together, and... the sons of God sound the trumpet. (<a href="3927/job_38_7.htm">Job 38:7</a>)</p><p>[3] Since the soundings of trumpets had these symbolic meanings, and in the Israelite Church everything was presented concretely in accordance with correspondences and the consequent symbolism, therefore it also came to pass, when Jehovah descended upon Mount Sinai, that there were voices and lightnings and a thick cloud, and the sound of a ram's horn, loud, with the sound of the ram's horn growing and becoming louder and louder, so that the people in the camp trembled greatly. (<a href="3927/exodus_19_16.htm">Exodus 19:16-25</a>)<p>Therefore it also came to pass that when the three hundred men with Gideon sounded their ram's horns in the campaign against Midian, then every Midianite man's sword was set against his companion and they fled (<a href="3927/judges_7_16.htm">Judges 7:16-22</a>). Likewise that twelve thousand of the children of Israel with holy vessels and trumpets in their hands overcame Midian (<a href="3927/numbers_31_1.htm">Numbers 31:1-8</a>). Also that the wall of Jericho fell after seven priests with seven ram's horns went around the city seven times (<a href="3927/joshua_6_1.htm">Joshua 6:1-20</a>).<p>Therefore we read in Jeremiah:<p>Sound against (Babylon) all around..., her walls are thrown down. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_15.htm">Jeremiah 50:15</a>)<p>And in Zephaniah:<p>...a day of darkness and blackness..., a day of ram's horn and its sounding against the fortified cities... (<a href="3927/zephaniah_1_15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15-16</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 397</h4><p>397. [verse 6] 'And the seven angels having the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound' signifies [the spiritual angels] prepared and equipped for examining the state of the Church and consequently of the life with those for whom religion is faith alone. What is signified by 'trumpets' is established from the statute respecting the uses of them with the sons of Israel, concerning which [it is stated] thus in Moses:<p>Jehovah spoke unto Moses, that he should make trumpets of silver for the calling together of the congregation, and for the departure of the camp, and that they should sound with them on days of joy, festivals, new moons, over the burnt-offerings and sacrifices; also that whenever they went to war against enemies attacking them they should sound an alarm with the trumpets, and that then they would come into remembrance before Jehovah God and be preserved from their enemies. <a href="3927/numbers_10_1.htm">Numbers 10:1-10</a>.<p>From these things it can be seen what is signified by 'to sound with trumpets.' That here by the seven angels sounding is signified the examination and making manifest of the quality of the state of the Church with those for whom religion is faith alone is plain from the details of this chapter, and from the details of the following chapters up to the sixteenth inclusive, understood in the spiritual sense.</p><p>[2] From the uses of trumpets with the sons of Israel it can also be seen what is signified by 'trumpets' and 'sounding with them' in the following passages:<p>Sound the horn (buccina) in Zion, and sound in the mountain of holiness, for the day of Jehovah is coming. <a href="3927/joel_2_1.htm">Joel 2:1-2</a>.<p>Jehovah shall appear over them, and His spear shall go forth as the lightning, and the Lord Jehovih shall sound the horn (buccina) <a href="3927/zechariah_9_14.htm">Zechariah 9:14</a>.<p>Jehovah shall go forth as a lion <sup>1</sup>, and sound. <a href="3927/isaiah_42_13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>.<p>In that day the great horn (buccina) shall sound, and those perishing in the land of Asshur, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall come and bow themselves down to Jehovah in the mountain of holiness . <a href="3927/isaiah_27_13.htm">Isaiah 27:13</a>.<p>He shall send angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from the extremities of the heavens to the extremities thereof. <a href="3927/matthew_24_31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>.<p>Blessed is the people that know the sound, they shall walk, O Jehovah, in the light of Thy faces. <a href="3927/psalms_89_15.htm">Psalms 89:15</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_89_16.htm">16</a>].<p>When the morning stars sing, and the sons of God sound <a href="3927/job_38_1.htm">Job 38</a>:[<a href="3927/job_38_7.htm">7</a>].</p><p>[3] Since the sounds of trumpets used to signify such things, and in the Israelitish Church all things were put into effect (sistebantur) in accordance with the correspondences and consequently the significations, therefore also it came to pass:<p>When Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai, that there were voices and lightnings and a heavy cloud, and the voice of a horn (buccina) exceeding loud, and the voice of a horn (luccina) going and strengthening itself greatly, and the people in the camp trembled exceedingly, <a href="3927/exodus_19_16.htm">Exodus 19:16-25</a>.<p>For the same reason it came to pass that:<p>When the three hundred with Gideon sounded with horns against Midian, then the sword of a man was against his companion, and they fled away, <a href="3927/judges_7_16.htm">Judges 7:16-22</a>.<p>In like manner that:<p>Twelve thousand of the sons of Israel with the vessels of holiness and the trumpets in their hands overcame Midian. <a href="3927/numbers_31_1.htm">Numbers 31:1-8</a>.<p>As also that:<p>The wall of Jericho fell down, after the seven priests with seven horns compassed the city seven times, <a href="3927/joshua_6_1.htm">Joshua 6:1-20</a>.<p>It is therefore said in Jeremiah:<p>Sound against Babel round about, her walls are destroyed. <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_15.htm">Jeremiah 50:15</a>. and in Zephanaiah:<p>A day of darkness and thick-darkness, a day of the horn and of sounding over the fortified cities, <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15-16</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Leo in the Original here, also in <a href="502.htm">502</a>[8]; but <a href="500.htm">500</a> and elsewhere heros (hero or mighty one), as in Hebrew. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 397</h4><p>397. Verse 6. And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound, signifies that they were prepared and girded to explore the state of the church, and thence the state of life, with those whose religion is faith alone. What is signified by "trumpets," appears from the statute respecting the use of them with the sons of Israel, concerning which it is thus written in Moses:<p>Jehovah spake unto Moses to make trumpets of silver for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps; and that they should sound with them on days of joy, festivals, new moons, over burnt-offerings and sacrifices; also, that when they went to war against enemies that infested them, they should blow an alarm with the trumpets, and that then they should come into remembrance before Jehovah God, and should be preserved from their enemies, (<a href="3927/numbers_10_1.htm">Numbers 10:1-10</a>).<p>From these words it may be seen what is signified by "sounding with trumpets." That here by "the seven angels sounding," is signified the exploration and manifestation of what the state of the church is with those whose religion is faith alone, is evident from the particulars of this chapter, and from the particulars of the chapters that follow as far as the sixteenth inclusive, when understood in the spiritual sense.</p><p>[2] From the use of trumpets with the sons of Israel may also be seen what is signified by "trumpets," and by "sounding with them," in the following passages:<p>Sound ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound in the mountain of holiness, for the day of Jehovah cometh, (<a href="3927/joel_2_1.htm">Joel 2:1-2</a>).<p>Jehovah shall appear upon them, and His arrow shall go forth as the lightning, and the Lord Jehovih shall sound the trumpet, (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_14.htm">Zechariah 9:14</a>).<p>Jehovah shall go forth as a lion and sound, (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>).<p>In that day the great trumpet shall be sounded, and they shall come that are perishing in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall bow themselves down to Jehovah in the mountain of holiness, (<a href="3927/isaiah_27_13.htm">Isaiah 27:13</a>).<p>He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other, (<a href="3927/matthew_24_31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>).<p>Happy is the people who know the sound; they shall walk, O Jehovah, in the light of Thy countenance, (<a href="3927/psalms_89_15.htm">Psalms 89:15</a>).<p>When the morning stars sing, and the sons of God sound, (<a href="3927/job_38_7.htm">Job 38:7</a>).</p><p>[3] Since "the sounds of trumpets" signify such things, and as, in the Israelitish Church, all things were represented to the life according to correspondences and thence significations, therefore it came to pass:<p>When Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai, that there were voices, and lightnings, and a heavy cloud, and a vehement voice of a trumpet, and the voice of the trumpet going and strengthening itself greatly, and the people in the camp trembled exceedingly, (<a href="3927/exodus_19_16.htm">Exodus 19:16-25</a>).<p>And for the same reason it came to pass:<p>When the three hundred with Gideon sounded with the trumpets against Midian, then the sword of a man was against his companion, and they fled away, (<a href="3927/judges_7_16.htm">Judges 7:16-22</a>).<p>In like manner, that:<p>Twelve thousand of the sons of Israel with vessels of holiness and trumpets in their hands overcame Midian, (<a href="3927/numbers_31_1.htm">Numbers 31:1-8</a>).<p>As also that:<p>The wall of Jericho fell down, after the seven priests with seven trumpets compassed the city seven times, (<a href="3927/joshua_6_1.htm">Joshua 6:1-20</a>).<p>Wherefore it is said in Jeremiah:<p>Sound against Babylon round about, her walls are destroyed, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_15.htm">Jeremiah 50:15</a>).<p>And in Zephaniah:<p>A day of darkness and thick darkness, a day of the trumpet and sounding against the fortified cities, (<a href="3927/zephaniah_1_15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>). </p>
