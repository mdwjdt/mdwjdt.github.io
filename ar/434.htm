<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第434节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>434.启9:8.“它们有头发像女人的头发”表他们在自己看来像是处于对真理的情感。在圣言中，“男人”表示对真理的理解；“女人”表示对真理的情感，因为男人生来就是认知或理解力，女人生来就是情感（关于这个主题，可参看《婚姻之爱》）。在圣言中，“头发”表示人生命的末端，也就是感官层（参看<a href="424.htm">424</a>节）。这感官层给他们一种表象，以为自己处于对真理的情感，而事实上，他们处于对虚假的情感；因为他们视这虚假为真理。“女人”表示对真理的情感，这一点从圣言中许多经文明显看出来；正因如此，教会被称为“妻子”、“女人”、“女儿”和“童女”，并且教会之所以成为教会，靠的就是对真理的爱慕或情感；因为对真理的理解就出自这种爱慕或情感。</p><p>在以下经文中，教会被称为“女人”（或译为女子、妇人）：</p><p>有两个女子，是一母所生，她们在埃及行邪淫，阿荷拉就是撒玛利亚，阿荷利巴就是耶路撒冷。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.2.htm">23:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.4.htm">4</a>）</p><p>耶和华召你，如召在灵里被离弃、忧伤的妇人，就是幼年的妇人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.6.htm">54:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.7.htm">7</a>）</p><p>耶和华在地上造了一件新事，就是女人护卫男人。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.21.htm">31:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.22.htm">22</a>）</p><p>“身披日头、被龙逼迫的妇人”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.1.htm">12:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.13.htm">13</a>）表示新教会，也就是新耶路撒冷。在许多经文中，“女人”（或译为女子、妇人）表示对真理的情感，教会凭此而成为教会，如以下经文：</p><p>你们将我民中的妇人从安乐家中赶出。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥2.9.htm">2:9</a>）</p><p>一家一家的都必悲哀，女的独在一处。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.11.htm">12:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>安逸的妇女啊，你们要起来，听我的言语！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛32.9.htm">32:9</a>）</p><p>你们为何作这恶，使你们的男人、妇女都剪除？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶44.7.htm">44:7</a>）</p><p>我要打碎男人和女人。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.22.htm">51:22</a>）</p><p>在此和别处，“男人”和“女人”在属灵之义上分别表示对真理的理解和对真理的情感。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 434</h4><p>434. They had hair like women's hair. (<a href="3927/revelation_9_8.htm">9:8</a>) This symbolically means that they seemed to themselves to have an affection for truth.<p>In the Word a man symbolizes an understanding of truth, and a woman an affection for truth, because a man is by birth a form of the intellect, and a woman a form of affection, as we say in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Marriage. <sup>1</sup>Hair in the Word symbolizes the lowest level of a person's life, which is the sensual level, as said in no. <a href="424.htm">424</a>. It is on this level that it seems to these people that they have an affection for truth, when in fact they have an affection for falsity, since they believe it to be true.<p>That a woman symbolizes an affection for truth can be seen from many passages in the Word. So it is that the church is called a wife, woman, daughter, and virgin. The church, moreover, is a church by virtue of its love or affection for truth, for this is what gives rise to an understanding of truth.</p><p>[2] The church is called a woman in the following places:<p>...there were two women, the daughters of one mother, (who) committed harlotry in Egypt..., Oholah (being) Samaria, and Oholibah (being) Jerusalem. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_23_2.htm">Ezekiel 23:2-4</a>)<p>...Jehovah has called you like a woman forsaken and afflicted in spirit, and a youthful woman... (<a href="3927/isaiah_54_6.htm">Isaiah 54:6-7</a>)<p>...Jehovah has created a new thing in the earth - a woman shall encompass a man. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_21.htm">Jeremiah 31:21-22</a>)<p>The woman clothed with the sun, whom the dragon pursued (<a href="3927/revelation_12_1.htm">Revelation 12</a>), symbolizes the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem.<p>Women symbolize affections for truth, by virtue of which the church is a church, in many other places, as in the following:<p>The women of My people you cast out from its delightful house. (<a href="3927/micah_2_9.htm">Micah 2:9</a>)<p>(The families of the houses shall mourn by themselves,) and... women by themselves... (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_11.htm">Zechariah 12:11-13</a>)<p>Rise up, you women at ease, hear... my speech. (<a href="3927/isaiah_32_9.htm">Isaiah 32:9</a>)<p>Why do you do... evil..., to cut off from you man and woman...? (<a href="3927/jeremiah_44_7.htm">Jeremiah 44:7</a>)<p>...I will scatter man and woman... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_22.htm">Jeremiah 51:22</a>)<p>A man and woman, here and elsewhere, mean, symbolically in the spiritual sense, an understanding of truth and an affection for truth.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;A reference to a work by that title never published by the writer. Extant in manuscript are a brief outline, a relatively short preliminary draft, and two indices for a longer draft on the subject of marriage that has not been found. The content of the existing material makes clear that these manuscripts, including the missing longer draft, were written in preparation for Delights of Wisdom Relating to Married Love (or Conjugial Love), Followed By Pleasures of Insanity Relating to Licentious Love, which the writer published in <a href="../ac/1768.htm">1768</a>, two years after publishing the present work on the Apocalypse. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 434</h4><p>434. [verse 8] 'And they had hair as the hair of women' signifies that they appeared to themselves [as if] in the affection of truth. In the Word by 'man' (vir) is signified the understanding of truth, and by 'woman' the affection of truth, because a man (vir) is born understanding, and a woman affection, concerning which subject [something shall be said] in ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING MARRIAGE. By 'hair' in the Word is signified the ultimate of a man's life, which is the sensual, concerning which (<a href="424.htm">424</a>). This is what appears to them as if in the affection of truth, when yet they are in the affection of untruth, for they believe that to be true. That a woman signifies the affection of truth can be established from many places in the Word. This is why the Church is called 'wife,' 'woman,' 'daughter' and 'virgin,' and the Church is a Church by virtue of the love or affection of truth, for out of this the understanding of truth is produced.</p><p>[2] The Church is called woman in these passages:<p>Two women of one mother, and they committed whoredom in Egypt, Ohola, which is Samaria, and Ohohiba, which is Jerusalem. <a href="3927/ezekiel_23_2.htm">Ezekiel 23:2-4</a>.<p>As a woman deserted and afflicted in spirit has Jehovah called thee, and a woman of youth. <a href="3927/isaiah_54_6.htm">Isaiah 54:6-7</a>.<p>Jehovah shall create a new thing in the land, a woman shall compass a man. <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_21.htm">Jeremiah 31:21-22</a>.<p>By 'the woman clothed with the sun, whom the dragon pursued' (Revelation xii) is signified the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem. In many places by 'women' are signified the affections of truth by virtue of which the Church is a Church, as in these:<p>The women of my people have you driven out of the house of their delights. <a href="3927/micah_2_9.htm">Micah 2:9</a>.<p>The families of houses shall mourn apart, and the women apart, <a href="3927/zechariah_12_11.htm">Zechariah 12:11-13</a>.<p>Stand up, O women who are at ease, hear my speech. <a href="3927/isaiah_32_9.htm">Isaiah 32:9</a>.<p>Wherefore are you doing evil to cut off from you man and woman? <a href="3927/jeremiah_44_7.htm">Jeremiah 44:7</a>.<p>I will scatter man and woman. <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_22.htm">Jeremiah 51:22</a>.<p>By 'man and woman' here and elsewhere in the spiritual sense is signified the understanding of truth and the affection of truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 434</h4><p>434. Verse 8. And they had hair as the hair of women, signifies that they appeared to themselves to be in the affection of truth. By "man" in the Word, is signified the understanding of truth; and "woman," the affection of truth, because the man is born understanding, and the woman affection; on which subject, see in The Angelic Wisdom Concerning Marriage. By "hair" in the Word, is signified the ultimate of man's life, which is the sensual (see <a href="424.htm">424</a>). This is what gives them the appearance of being in the affection of truth, when yet they are in the affection of falsity; for this they believe to be truth. That a "woman" signifies the affection of truth, may appear from many passages in the Word; hence it is, that the church is called "a wife," "a woman," "a daughter," and "a virgin," and the church is a church from the love or affection of truth; for from this comes the understanding of truth.</p><p>[2] The church is called "a woman" in these passages:<p>There were two women of one mother, and they committed whoredom in Egypt, Ohola which is Samaria, and Oholiba which is Jerusalem, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_23_2.htm">Ezekiel 23:2-4</a>).<p>Jehovah hath called thee as a woman deserted and afflicted in spirit, and a woman of youth, (<a href="3927/isaiah_54_6.htm">Isaiah 54:6-7</a>).<p>Jehovah will create a new thing in the earth, a woman shall compass a man, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_21.htm">Jeremiah 31:21-22</a>).<p>By "the woman clothed with the sun, whom the dragon persecuted" (<a href="3927/revelation_12_1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_13.htm">13</a>), is signified the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem. By "women" are signified the affections of truth, from which the church is a church, in many passages, as in the following:<p>The women of My people have ye driven out from the house of her delights, (<a href="3927/micah_2_9.htm">Micah 2:9</a>).<p>The families of houses shall mourn apart, and the women apart, (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_11.htm">Zechariah 12:11-13</a>).<p>Stand up, ye secure women, hear my speech, (<a href="3927/isaiah_32_9.htm">Isaiah 32:9</a>)<p>Wherefore do ye evil to cut off from you man and woman? (<a href="3927/jeremiah_44_7.htm">Jeremiah 44:7</a>).<p>I will disperse man and woman, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_22.htm">Jeremiah 51:22</a>).<p>By "man" and "woman," here and elsewhere, is signified, in the spiritual sense, the understanding of truth and the affection of truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 434 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>434. (Vers. 8.) "Et habebant capillos sicut capillos mulierum" significat quod apparerent sibi (sicut) in actione veri. - In Verbo per "virum" significatur intellectus veri, et per "mulierem" affectio veri, quia vir nascitur intellectus, et mulier affectio, de quo, illi Sapientia Angelica de Conjugio. Per "capillos" in Verbo significatur ultimum vitae hominis, quod est sensuale (de quo <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_434/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_424" target=_top>424</a>); hoc est quod illis apparet sicut in affectione veri, cum tamen sunt in affectione falsi, hoc enim credunt esse verum. Quod "mulier" significet affectionem veri, constare potest a multis locis in Verbo; inde est quod Ecclesia dicatur "uxor," "mulier," filia," "virgo;" et Ecclesia est Ecclesia ex amore seu affectione veri, ex hac enim fit intellectus veri. Ecclesia vocatur "mulier" in his locis: <p>Duae Mulieres unius Matris, quae scortatae sunt in Aegypto, Ohola quae Samaria, et Oholiba quae Hierosolyma, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_434/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_23_2-4" target=_top>Ezechiel 23:2-4</a>);<p>"Quasi Mulierem desertam et afflictam spiritu vocavit te Jehovah, et Mulierem juventutis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_434/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_54_6-7" target=_top>Esaias 54:6-7</a>);<p>"Creabit Jehovah novum in terra, Mulier circumdabit virum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_434/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_31_21-22" target=_top>Jeremias 31:21-22</a>).<p>Per "mulierem circumdatam sole, quam Draco persecutus est," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_434/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_1-18" target=_top>12</a>), significatur Nova Ecclesia, quae est Nova Hierosolyma. Per "mulieres" significantur affectiones veri, ex quibus Ecclesia est Ecclesia, pluribus in locis ut in his: <p>"Mulieres populi Mei expellitis e domo deliciarum ejus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_434/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_micah_2_9" target=_top>Micham 2:9</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>Plangent familiae domuum seorsim, et Mulieres seorsim, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_434/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_12_11-13" target=_top>Sacharias 12:11-13</a>);<p>"Mulieres securae consistite, audite sermonem Meum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_434/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_32_9" target=_top>Esaias 32:9</a>);<p>"Quare facitis malum ad exscindendum vobis Virum et.
