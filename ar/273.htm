<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第273节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>273.“这羔羊前来，从坐宝座的右手里拿了书卷”表主的神性人就是圣言，祂的神性人出于祂自己里面的神性，因此，祂将凭祂的神性人行审判。显然，此处“坐宝座的”和“羔羊”是一个人；“坐宝座的”表示主的神性，万物皆来自这神性，“羔羊”表示祂的神性人。因为上一节说“他看见羔羊站在宝座中间”，本节说“羔羊从坐宝座的右手里拿了书卷”。主将通过祂的神性人行审判，因为祂就是圣言。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>那时，人子的兆头要显现，他们要看见人子有能力，有大荣耀，驾着天上的云降临。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.30.htm">24:30</a>）</p><p>到人子坐在祂宝座上的时候，祂要审判以色列十二个支派。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.28.htm">19:28</a>）</p><p>人子要在祂父的荣耀里降临，那时，祂要照各人的行为报应各人。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.27.htm">16:27</a>）</p><p>你们要时时警醒，得以站立在人子面前。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.36.htm">21:36</a>）</p><p>在你们想不到的时辰，人子就来了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.44.htm">24:44</a>）</p><p>父不审判人，乃将审判的事全交与子，因为祂是人子。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.22.htm">5:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.27.htm">27</a>）</p><p>“人子”是指主的神性人，主的神性人就是圣言，圣言就是神，并是成了肉身（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 273</h4><p>273. Then He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne. (<a href="3927/revelation_5_7.htm">5:7</a>) This symbolically means that the Lord in respect to His Divine humanity embodies the Word, and this from His Divinity within Him, and therefore He will execute judgment based on His Divine humanity.<p>It is clearly apparent here that the Lamb and He who sat on the throne are the same person, and that He who sat on the throne means His Divinity from which all else comes, while the Lamb is His Divine humanity; for we are told in the preceding verse that John saw the Lamb standing in the midst of the throne, and now that He took the book from Him who sat on the throne.<p>That the Lord was to execute judgment based on His Divine humanity, because He embodies the Word, is clear from the following passages:<p>Then (they will see) the sign of the Son of Man... and they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and... glory. (<a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>)<p>...when the Son of Man sits on (His) throne..., (He will judge) the twelve tribes of Israel. (<a href="3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>)<p>...the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father..., and then He will reward each according to his works. (<a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>)<p>Watch... always that you may be counted worthy... to stand before the Son of Man. (<a href="3927/luke_21_36.htm">Luke 21:36</a>)<p>...the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. (<a href="3927/matthew_24_44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>)<p>...the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son..., because He is the Son of Man. (<a href="3927/john_5_22.htm">John 5:22</a>, <a href="3927/john_5_27.htm">27</a>)<p>The Son of Man is the Lord in respect to His Divine humanity, and this is the Word that was God and became flesh (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 273</h4><p>273. [verse 7] 'And He came and took the book out of the right hand of the One sitting upon the throne' signifies that the Lord as to His Divine Human is the Word, and that He is this out of His Divine Itself, and that on this account He is going to effect the judgment out of the Divine Human. Here it is quite plain that 'the One sitting upon the throne' and 'the Lamb' are one Person, and that by 'the One sitting upon the throne' is understood His Divine from which [are all things], and by 'the Lamb' His Divine Human for in the preceding verse it is said that he saw 'a Lamb standing in the midst of the throne,' and in this that 'He took the book' from 'the One sitting upon the throne.' That the Lord is going to make the judgment out of His Divine Human, because He is the Word, is established from these passages:<p>Then shall they see the sign of the Son of Man; and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with vigor (virtus) and glory. <a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>.<p>When the Son of Man shall sit upon His throne He is going to judge the twelve tribes of Israel. <a href="3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>.<p>The Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father, and then He shall make a return to each one according to his deeds. <a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>.<p>Watch always, that you may be accounted worthy to stand before the Son of Man. <a href="3927/luke_21_36.htm">Luke 21:36</a>.<p>In such an hour as you think not, the Son of Man comes. <a href="3927/matthew_24_44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>.<p>The Father does not judge anyone, but has given all judgment to the Son, because He is the Son of Man, <a href="3927/john_5_1.htm">John 5</a>:[<a href="3927/john_5_22.htm">22</a>,] <a href="3927/john_5_27.htm">27</a>.<p>'The Son of Man' is the Lord as to the Divine Human, and this is 'the Word,' which 'was God' and 'was made flesh' (<a href="3927/john_5_14.htm">John 5:14</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 273</h4><p>273. Verse 7 (<a href="3927/revelation_5_7.htm">Revelation 5:7</a>). And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne, signifies that the Lord as to His Divine Human is the Word, and this is from His Divine in Himself and that therefore He will execute judgment from His Divine Human. Here it manifestly appears, that "He that sat upon the throne" and "the Lamb" are one Person, and that by "Him that sat upon the throne" is meant His Divine from which all things are, and by "the Lamb," His Divine Human; for it is said in the preceding verse, that "he saw a Lamb standing in the midst of the throne," and in this, that "He took the book from Him that sat upon the throne." That the Lord will execute judgment from His Divine Human, because He is the Word, is evident from these passages:<p>And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man; and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory, (<a href="3927/matthew_24_30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>).<p>When the Son of man shall sit on His throne He will judge the twelve tribes of Israel, (<a href="3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>).<p>The Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father, and then shall He render to everyone according to his deeds, (<a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>).<p>Watch always, that ye may be accounted worthy to stand before the Son of man, (<a href="3927/luke_21_36.htm">Luke 21:36</a>).<p>In such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh, (<a href="3927/matthew_24_44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>).<p>For the Father judgeth no one, but hath given all judgment unto the Son, because He is the Son of man, (<a href="3927/john_5_22.htm">John 5:22</a>, <a href="3927/john_5_27.htm">27</a>). "The Son of man" is the Lord as to the Divine Human, and this is the Word, which was God, and became flesh, (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 273 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>273. (Vers. 7.) "Et venit et accepit Librum e dextra Sedentis super Throno" significat quod Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum Suum sit Verbum, et quod hoc ex Divino Suo in Ipso, et quod propterea ex Divino Humano Suo facturus sit Judicium. - Hic manifeste patet, quod "Sedens super Throno" et "Agnus" sint una Persona, et quod per "Sedentem super Throno" intelligatur Divinum Ipsius a Quo, et per "Agnum" Divinum Humanum Ipsius nam dicitur in praecedente versu, quod "viderit Agnum stantem in medio Throni," et nunc quod "acceperit a Sedente super Throno Librum." Quod Dominus ex Divino Humano Suo facturus sit Judicium, quia est Verbum, constat ex his locis: <p>"Tunc videbunt signum Filii Hominis: et videbunt Filium Hominis venientem in nubibus Caeli cum virtute et gloria," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_273/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_30" target=_top>Matthaeus 24:30</a>);<p>"Quando sedebit Filius Hominis super Throno Suo judicaturus duodecim Tribus Israelis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_273/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_19_28" target=_top>Matthaeus 19:28</a>) <p>"Venturus est Filius Hominis in gloria Patris Sui, et tunc reddet unicuique secundum facta ejus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_273/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_16_27" target=_top>Matthaeus 16:27</a>);<p>"Vigilate omni tempore, ut digni habeamini ad consistendum coram Filio Hominis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_273/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_21_36" target=_top>Luca 21:36</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>"Qua hora non putatis, Filius Hominis venit," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_273/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_24_44" target=_top>Matthaeus 24:44</a>);<p>"Pater non judicat quemquam, sed omne judicium dedit Filio quia Filius Hominis est," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_273/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_5_22" target=_top>Johannes 5:22</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_273/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_5_27" target=_top>27</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>"Filius Hominis" est Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum, et Hoc est Verbum, Quod fuit Deus et Caro factum est, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_273/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_1" target=_top>Johannes 1:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_273/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_14" target=_top>14</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_273/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_21_36" target=_top>Luca 21:36</a> pro "<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_273/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_16_27" target=_top>Matthaeus 16:27</a>"<p>2.&nbsp;22, 27 pro "27" </p>
