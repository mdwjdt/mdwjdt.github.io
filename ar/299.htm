<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>299.“骑在马上的拿着弓”表他们拥有出于圣言的真理与良善的教义，他们凭这教义与来自地狱的虚假与邪恶、因而与地狱争战。如启示录（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.11.htm">19:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.13.htm">13</a>）提到的“骑在白马上的”表示主的圣言或圣言方面的主；而此处“骑在这白马上的”则表示在出于圣言、因而出于主的真理与良善的教义方面的天使人（man-angel）；以下经文中的也一样：</p><p>主在天上的众军骑着白马跟随主。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.14.htm">19:14</a>）</p><p>论到启示录十九章中“骑在白马上的”，经上说：</p><p>有利剑从祂口中出来，祂要用这剑击打列族。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.15.htm">19:15</a>）</p><p>“从祂口中出来的利剑”表示与虚假并邪恶争战的圣言神性真理（<a href="52.htm">52</a>，<a href="108.htm">108</a>，<a href="117.htm">117</a>节）；不过，此处说骑在这白马上的“拿着弓”，而“弓”表示与邪恶并虚假争战、出于圣言的真理与良善的教义。与虚假并邪恶争战也就是与地狱争战，因为邪恶与虚假就出自地狱，故也表示这一点。</p><p>在圣言中，“弓”表示正反两种意义上的争战的教义，这一点从以下经文可以得到证实：</p><p>耶和华的箭锐利，祂一切的弓也上了弦，马蹄算如火石。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.28.htm">5:28</a>）</p><p>主张弓好像仇敌。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.4.htm">2:4</a>）</p><p>耶和华啊，你乘在马上，你的弓全然显露。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.8.htm">3:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>祂将列族交在祂面前，使祂管辖列王。祂把他们如灰尘交与祂的剑，如碎秸交与祂的弓。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.2.htm">41:2</a>）</p><p>在这些地方，“弓”因论及耶和华或主，故表示圣言，主通过圣言在人里面与邪恶并虚假交战。</p><p>我必除灭以法莲的战车和耶路撒冷的战马，争战的弓也必除灭；他必向列族讲和平。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.10.htm">9:10</a>）</p><p>他们弯起舌，他们的弓是谎言，不是真理。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.3.htm">9:3</a>）</p><p>看哪，恶人弯弓，把箭搭在弦上，要在暗中射那心里正直的人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗11.2.htm">11:2</a>）</p><p>他们苦害约瑟，向他射箭，弓箭手以仇恨待他；但他必坐在他弓的力量中，这是因雅各大能者的手。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.23.htm">49:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.24.htm">24</a>）</p><p>要摆阵攻击巴比伦，你们都要弯弓射击她，不要爱惜箭枝，因她得罪了耶和华。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.14.htm">50:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.29.htm">29</a>）</p><p>大卫作哀歌，吊扫罗，以教导犹大人，这歌名叫弓歌。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.17.htm">1:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.18.htm">18</a>）</p><p>这哀歌描述了真理与虚假的争战。</p><p>万军之耶和华如此说；看哪，我必折断以拦人的弓，就是他的威力之始。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.35.htm">49:35</a>）</p><p>耶和华使我成为磨亮的箭，将我藏在祂的箭袋之中。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.2.htm">49:2</a>）</p><p>看哪，儿女是耶和华的产业，箭袋装满了箭的人是有福的。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗127.3.htm">127:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗127.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p>“儿女”在此和在其它地方一样，表示教义的真理。</p><p>在撒冷有耶和华的帐幕，祂在那里折断弓弦，并盾牌、刀剑和争战。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗76.1.htm">76:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗76.3.htm">3</a>）</p><p>耶和华止息争战，祂要折弓、断枪，把战车焚烧在火中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗46.9.htm">46:9</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.8.htm">39:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.9.htm">9</a>；何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.18.htm">2:18</a>）</p><p>在这些经文中，“弓”表示与虚假争战的真理的教义，在反面意义上表示与真理对抗的虚假的教义；因此，“箭”和“镖”表示真理或虚假。由于在圣言中，“战争”表示属灵的战争，故战争的武器，如刀剑、长矛、大小盾牌、弓和箭，都表示诸如属于这战争的那类事物。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 299</h4><p>299. And he who sat on it had a bow. This symbolizes their having a doctrine of truth and goodness from the Word, from which they fought against falsities and evils emanating from hell, thus fighting against hell.<p>He who sat on the white horse in <a href="3927/revelation_19_11.htm">Revelation 19:11-13</a> means the Lord in relation to the Word, but he who sat on this white horse means an angelic person in relation to a doctrine of truth and goodness from the Word, thus a doctrine from the Lord, like the army of the Lord in heaven which followed the Lord on white horses in <a href="3927/revelation_19_14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>.<p>Regarding Him who sat on the white horse in <a href="3927/revelation_19_1.htm">Revelation 19</a>, we are told that out of his mouth went a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations, and the sword going out of His mouth symbolizes the Divine truth of the Word fighting against falsities and evils (nos. <a href="52.htm">52</a>, <a href="108.htm">108</a>, <a href="117.htm">117</a>). Here, however, we are told that he who sat on this white horse had a bow, and the bow symbolizes a doctrine of truth and goodness from the Word fighting against evils and falsities.<p>To fight against falsities and evils is also to fight against the hells, as evils and falsities emanate from there, and therefore this, too, is symbolically meant.</p><p>[2] That a bow in the Word symbolizes doctrine doing battle in both senses can be seen from the following passages:<p>(Jehovah's) arrows are sharp, and all His bows bent; His horses' hooves are accounted as rocks. (<a href="3927/isaiah_5_28.htm">Isaiah 5:28</a>)<p>(The Lord) has bent his bow like an enemy... (<a href="3927/lamentations_2_4.htm">Lamentations 2:4</a>)<p>O Jehovah..., You ride on Your horses; ...Your bow will be bared. (<a href="3927/habakkuk_3_8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8-9</a>)<p>He gave the nations before Him, and made Him rule over kings. He gave them as the dust to His sword, as... stubble to His bow. (<a href="3927/isaiah_41_2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>)<p>Because the subject is Jehovah or the Lord, a bow in these places symbolizes the Word, from which the Lord fights in a person against evils and falsities.<p>I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem; the war bow shall be cut off. Rather He shall speak peace to the nations. (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>)<p>They bend their tongue, their bow a lie, and not the truth... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_9_3.htm">Jeremiah 9:3</a>)<p>Lo, the wicked bend their bow; they make ready their arrows on the bowstring, to shoot in the dark the upright in heart. (<a href="3927/psalms_11_2.htm">Psalms 11:2</a>)<p>They will provoke Joseph and shoot at him; the archers will hate him. But he will rest on the tautness of his bow... by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob... (<a href="3927/genesis_49_23.htm">Genesis 49:23-24</a>)<p>Set yourselves in array against Babylon... All you who bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrow, for she has sinned against Jehovah. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_14.htm">Jeremiah 50:14</a>, cf. <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_29.htm">50:29</a>)<p>David lamented... over Saul... to teach the children of Judah the Bow. (<a href="3927/2-samuel_1_17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-18</a>)<p>This lamentation describes the combat of truth against falsities.</p><p>[3] Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: "Lo, I am breaking the bow of Elam, the source of its might." (<a href="3927/jeremiah_49_35.htm">Jeremiah 49:35</a>)<p>(Jehovah) made Me a polished arrow; in His quiver He has hidden Me. (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>)<p>Behold, children are a heritage from Jehovah... Blessed is the man who has filled his quiver with them. (<a href="3927/psalms_127_3.htm">Psalms 127:3-5</a>)<p>Children here and elsewhere symbolize doctrinal truths.<p>In Salem shall be (Jehovah's) tabernacle... There He broke the strings of the bow, the shield, the sword, and the war. (<a href="3927/psalms_76_1.htm">Psalms 76:1-3</a>)<p>(Jehovah) will make wars cease... He will break the bow..., cut asunder the spear; He will burn the chariot with fire. (<a href="3927/psalms_46_9.htm">Psalms 46:9</a>; cf. <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_8.htm">Ezekiel 39:8-9</a>, <a href="3927/hosea_2_18.htm">Hosea 2:18</a>)<p>In these places a bow symbolizes a doctrine of truth fighting against falsities, and in an opposite sense, a doctrine of falsity fighting against truths. Arrows accordingly symbolize truths or falsities.<p>Since a war in the Word symbolizes a spiritual war, therefore the weapons of war - such as the sword, spear, shield, buckler, bow, and arrows - symbolize the kind of things that have to do with that war. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 299</h4><p>299. 'And the one sitting upon it having a bow' signifies that with these there is a doctrine of truth and good out of the Word, out of which they have fought against the untruths and evils that [come] out of hell, thus against hell. By the 'One sitting upon a white horse,' of Whom, <a href="3927/revelation_19_13.htm">Revelation 19:13</a> [treats], is understood the Lord as to the Word, but by the 'one sitting' upon this 'white horse' is understood a man [who is] an angel as to the doctrine of truth and good out of the Word, thus out of the Lord, in like manner as by the Lord's army in heaven, which 'was following the Lord upon white horses' (<a href="3927/revelation_19_14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>). Of the One sitting upon the white horse (Revelation xix) it is said that 'out of His mouth there went forth a sharp sword that with it He should smite the nations,' and by the 'sword out of His mouth' is signified the Divine Truth of the Word fighting against untruths and evils (<a href="52.htm">52</a>, <a href="108.htm">108</a>, <a href="117.htm">117</a>). Here, however, it is said that the one sitting on this white horse had 'a bow,' and by 'a bow' is signified a doctrine of truth and good out of the Word fighting against evils and untruths. To fight against untruths and evils is also to fight against the hells, because evils and untruths are therefrom, and therefore this also is signified.</p><p>[2] That 'a bow' in the Word signifies a doctrine fighting in either [a good sense or an opposite] sense can be confirmed from these passages:<p>The darts of Jehovah are sharp, and all His bows bent, the hooves of His horses are accounted as rocks. <a href="3927/isaiah_5_28.htm">Isaiah 5:28</a>.<p>The Lord has bent His bow like an enemy, <a href="3927/lamentations_2_4.htm">Lamentations 2:4</a>.<p>Thou, O Jehovah, ridest upon Thy horses, Thy bow shall be made naked, <a href="3927/habakkuk_3_8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8-9</a>.<p>He gave the nations before Him, and made Him to rule over kings, He gave [them] as dust to His sword, as stubble to His bow. <a href="3927/isaiah_41_2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>.<p>In these passages 'a bow,' because it [is said] of Jehovah or the Lord, signifies the Word, out of which the Lord with a man fights against evils and untruths.<p>I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war shall be cut off, until (contra) He shall speak peace to the nations, <a href="3927/zechariah_9_10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>.<p>They bend their tongue, their bow is a lie, and not the truth (veritas). <a href="3927/jeremiah_9_3.htm">Jeremiah 9:3</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/jeremiah_9_2.htm">2</a>].<p>Lo the wicked bend the bow, they make ready the arrows upon the string, to aim in the darkness at the upright in heart. <a href="3927/psalms_11_2.htm">Psalms 11:2</a>.<p>They shall provoke Joseph and take aim, the archers shall hate him, but he shall sit in the firmness of his bow from the hands of the strong Jacob. <a href="3927/genesis_49_23.htm">Genesis 49:23-24</a>.<p>Put yourselves in array against Babel, all bending the bow shoot at her, do not spare the dart for she has sinned against Jehovah. <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_14.htm">Jeremiah 50:14</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_29.htm">29</a>.<p>David lamented over Saul, to teach the sons of Judah the bow, <a href="3927/2-samuel_1_17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17</a> [,<a href="3927/2-samuel_1_18.htm">18</a>].<p>In that lamentation it treats of the combat of truth against untruths.</p><p>[3] Jehovah Zebaoth says, Behold I am breaking the bow of Elam, the beginning of his might. <a href="3927/jeremiah_49_35.htm">Jeremiah 49:35</a>.<p>Jehovah has made me into a cleansed dart, in His quiver has He hidden me. <a href="3927/isaiah_49_2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>.<p>Behold, sons are an heritage of Jehovah, blessed is he who has filled his quiver with them. <a href="3927/psalms_127_3.htm">Psalms 127:3-5</a>.<p>'Sons' here, as elsewhere, signify truths of doctrine.<p>In Salem shall be the tabernacle of Jehovah, there broke He the strings of the bow, the shield, the sword, and the war. <a href="3927/psalms_76_1.htm">Psalms 76:1-3</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_76_2.htm">2-4</a>].<p>Jehovah will make wars to cease, He will break the bow, He will cut the spear asunder, He will burn up the chariot with fire. <a href="3927/psalms_46_9.htm">Psalms 46:9</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_46_10.htm">10</a>]; <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_8.htm">Ezekiel 39:8-9</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_2_18.htm">Hosea 2:18</a>.<p>In these places a 'bow' signifies a doctrine of truth fighting against untruths, and in the opposite sense a doctrine of untruth fighting against truths. Consequently 'arrows' and 'darts' signify truths or untruths. Since a 'war' in the Word signifies a spiritual war, therefore the weapons of war, as sword, spear, buckler (clypeus), shield (scutum), bow, arrows, signify such things as belong to that war. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 299</h4><p>299. And he that sat upon him had a bow, signifies that they had the doctrine of truth and good from the Word, from which they fought against the falsities and evils which are from hell, thus against hell. By "Him that sat upon the white horse," as mentioned in <a href="3927/revelation_19_13.htm">Revelation 19:13</a>, is meant the Lord as to the Word; but by him that sat upon this white horse, is meant a man-angel as to the doctrine of truth and good from the Word, thus from the Lord; in like manner as by:<p>The Lord's army in heaven, which followed the Lord upon white horses, (<a href="3927/revelation_19_14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>).<p>Of Him that sat on the white horse (Revelation 19), it is said that:<p>Out of His mouth went forth a sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations, (<a href="3927/revelation_19_15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).<p>And by "the sword out of His mouth," is signified the Divine truth of the Word fighting against falsities and evils, (<a href="52.htm">52</a>, <a href="108.htm">108</a>, <a href="117.htm">117</a>); but here it is said that he who sat on this white horse had "a bow," and by "a bow" is signified the doctrine of truth and good from the Word fighting against evils and falsities. To fight against falsities and evils is also to fight against the hells, because evils and falsities are from thence, therefore this also is signified.</p><p>[2] That "a bow," in the Word, signifies doctrine combating, in both senses, may appear from these passages:<p>The arrows of Jehovah are sharp, and all His bows bent, the hoofs of His horses shall be counted like flints, (<a href="3927/isaiah_5_28.htm">Isaiah 5:28</a>).<p>The Lord bent His bow like an enemy, (<a href="3927/lamentations_2_4.htm">Lamentations 2:4</a>).<p>Thou, O Jehovah, ridest upon Thy horses, Thy bow shall be made naked, (<a href="3927/habakkuk_3_8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8-9</a>).<p>He gave the nations before Him and made Him rule over kings. He gave them as dust to His sword, and as stubble to His bow, (<a href="3927/isaiah_41_2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>).<p>In these places "a bow," because it is applied to Jehovah or the Lord, signifies the Word, from which the Lord fights with man against evils and falsities.<p>I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war shall be cut off; and he shall speak peace to the nations, (<a href="3927/zechariah_9_10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>).<p>They bend their tongue, their bow is a lie, and not the truth, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_9_3.htm">Jeremiah 9:3</a>).<p>Behold the wicked bend their bow, they make ready the arrows upon the string, to shoot in the darkness the upright in heart, (<a href="3927/psalms_11_2.htm">Psalms 11:2</a>).<p>They shall sorely grieve Joseph, and shoot, the archers hold him in hatred; but he shall sit in the strength of his bow, from the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, (<a href="3927/genesis_49_23.htm">Genesis 49:23-24</a>).<p>Put yourselves in array against Babylon, all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare not the arrow, for she hath sinned against Jehovah, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_14.htm">Jeremiah 50:14</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_29.htm">29</a>).<p>David lamented over Saul to teach the sons of Judah the bow, (<a href="3927/2-samuel_1_17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-18</a>).<p>In that lamentation the combat of truth against falsities is treated of.</p><p> [3] Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts; Behold I break the bow of Elam, the beginning of his might, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_49_35.htm">Jeremiah 49:35</a>).<p>Jehovah hath made me a polished shaft, in His quiver hath He hidden me, (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>).<p>Behold, sons are an heritage of Jehovah, happy is he that hath filled his quiver with them, (<a href="3927/psalms_127_3.htm">Psalms 127:3-5</a>).<p>"Sons" here, as in other places, signify truths of doctrine.<p>In Salem shall be the tabernacle of Jehovah, there broke He the string of the bow, the shield, the sword, and war, (<a href="3927/psalms_76_2.htm">Psalms 76:2-3</a>).<p>Jehovah will make wars to cease, He will break the bow, He will cut the spear in sunder, He will burn the chariot in the fire, (<a href="3927/psalms_46_9.htm">Psalms 46:9</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_8.htm">Ezekiel 39:8-9</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_2_18.htm">Hosea 2:18</a>).<p>In these passages "a bow" signifies the doctrine of truth combating against falsities, and in the opposite sense, the doctrine of falsity combating against truths; therefore "arrows" and "darts" signify truths or falsities. As "war" in the Word signifies spiritual war, therefore the arms of war, such as the sword, spear, shield, buckler, bow and arrows, signify such things as belong to that war. </p>
