<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第66节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>66.“你所看见的七灯台就是七个教会”表地上的新教会，也就是由主那里从新天堂而降的新耶路撒冷。“灯台”是指教会（参看<a href="43.htm">43</a>节）；由于“七”表全部（<a href="10.htm">10</a>节），故“七灯台”不是七个教会，而是指整体上的教会，该教会本身为一，只是照着接受程度不同而各异。这种多样性好比王冠上的各种珠宝，也好比全身合而为一的各种肢体和器官。每种形态的完美都通过被排列得井然有序的各种事物而存在。这就为何整个新教会的多样性在下文被描述为“七个教会”。</p><p>新天堂和新教会的信仰共识</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 66</h4><p>66. "And the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches." This symbolizes a new church on earth, which is the New Jerusalem descending from the Lord out of the New Heaven.<p>That the lampstands mean the church may be seen in no. <a href="43.htm">43</a> above. And because seven symbolically means all (no. <a href="10.htm">10</a>), the seven lampstands do not mean seven churches but the church in its entirety, which in itself is one, though varied in accordance with people's reception. These variations may be compared to the various jewels in a royal crown; and they may also be compared to the various members and organs in an intact body, which nevertheless form a single unit. The perfection of every form arises from various components suitably arranged in their proper order. That is why the seven churches describe the entire New Church in its varieties in what now follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 66</h4><p>66. 'And the seven lampstands which thou hast seen are the seven Churches' signifies the New Church on earth (in terris), which is the New Jerusalem coming down from the Lord out of the New Heaven. That 'the lampstands' are the Church may be seen above (<a href="43.htm">43</a>); and because 'seven' signifies all (<a href="10.htm">10</a>), by 'the seven lampstands' are not understood seven Churches, but the Church in its whole compass; and this in itself is one, but varying in accordance with reception. The variations can be compared to various diadems in a king's crown, and can also be compared to the various members and organs in a complete body, which yet make one. The perfection of each form comes into existence in consequence of various things being disposed suitably in their order. This is why the entire New Church with its varieties is described by 'the seven Churches' in the things now following. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 66</h4><p>66. And the seven lampstands which thou sawest are the seven churches, signifies the New Church upon earth, which is the New Jerusalem descending from the Lord out of the New Heaven. That "the lampstands" are the church, may be seen above, (<a href="43.htm">43</a>); and because "seven" signify all, (<a href="10.htm">10</a>), by "the seven lampstands" are not meant seven churches, but the church in the aggregate, which in itself is one, but various according to reception. Those varieties may be compared to the various diadems in the crown of a king; and they may also be compared to the various members and organs in a perfect body, which yet make one. The perfection of every form exists from various things being suitably arranged in their order. Hence it is, that the whole New Church is described as to its varieties by "the seven churches," in what follows. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 66 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>66. "Et septem Candelabra quae vidisti, septem Ecclesiae sunt," significat Novam Ecclesiam in terris, quae est Nova Hierosolyma descendens a Domino e Novo Caelo. - Quod "Candelabra" sint Ecclesia, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_66/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_43" target=_top>43</a>); et quia "septem" significant omnes (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_66/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_10" target=_top>10</a>), per "septem Candelabra" non intelliguntur septem Ecclesiae, sed Ecclesia in toto complexu, quae in se una est, sed varia secundum receptionem. Varietates illae comparari possunt variis diadematibus in corona Regis; et quoque comparari possunt variis membris et organis in perfecto Corpore, quae usque unum faciunt. Perfectio cujusvis formae ex variis convenienter in Suo ordine positis existit. Inde est, quod Universa Nova Ecclesia cum suis variis in nunc sequentibus per septem Ecclesias describatur. </p>
