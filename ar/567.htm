<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第567节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>567.启13:1.“我又看见一个兽从海中上来”表改革宗教会中在那龙关于神和救恩的教义和信仰上原则性较强的平信徒。至于何为龙的信仰及其性质，可参看前文（<a href="537.htm">537</a>节）。本章继续论述该信仰；约翰所看到“从海中上来”的这个“兽”表示平信徒当中的这信仰；而11节所提到的“从地中上来的兽”表示神职人员当中的这信仰。此处继续论述“龙”，这一点从本章的这些话明显看出来：</p><p>那龙将自己的能力，宝座，和大权柄，都给了从海中上来的兽。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.2.htm">13:2</a>）</p><p>他们又拜那龙，因为他将权柄给了兽。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.4.htm">13:4</a>）</p><p>从地中上来的那兽说话好像龙。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.11.htm">13:11</a>）</p><p>他在龙面前施行头一个兽所有的权柄。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.12.htm">13:12</a>）</p><p>“从海中上来的兽”表示平信徒，“从地中上来的兽”表示神职人员，这是因为“海”表示教会的外在，“地”表示教会的内在（<a href="398.htm">398</a>节，以及其它地方）；平信徒处于教会教义的外在事物，而神职人员则处于其内在事物。因此缘故，在下文，“从地中上来的兽”还被称为“假先知”。之所以表示那些在改革宗教会中的人，是因为直到16章（包括16章在内）论述的都是改革宗，而17和18章论述的是天主教，然后论述的是最后的审判，最后论述的是新教会。</p><p>他们看上去像“兽”，是因为龙是兽，又因为在圣言中，“兽”表示人的情感；无害和有用的兽表示人的良善情感，有害和无用的兽表示人的邪恶情感。因此，教会之人通常被称为“绵羊”，他们的会众被称为“羊群”，施行教导的人则被称为“牧人”（即牧师）。这也是为何前面第四章以“四个活物”，即“狮子、牛犊、飞鹰和人”来描述圣言的能力、情感、聪明和智慧，第六章以“马”来描述对圣言的理解。这是因为在灵界，人的情感从远处看就像各种兽，如前面频繁所述，而兽就本身而言，无非是属世情感的形式，而人不仅是属世情感的形式，同时还是属灵情感的形式。</p><p>“兽”（或“动物”、“活物”）表示人的情感，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>你降下大雨，你产业疲乏的时候，你使他坚固；你会众的兽住在其中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.9.htm">68:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>森林中的各样野兽是我的，千山上的牲畜也是我的。山中的各样飞鸟，我都知道，田野的走兽也都属我。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗50.10.htm">50:10</a>，<a

href="http://39-27.cn/何2.19.htm">19</a>）</p><p>要欢喜快乐，我田野的走兽啊，不要惧怕，因为旷野的草场又发青了。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.21.htm">2:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.23.htm">23</a>）</p><p>那日必有大扰乱，犹大也必与耶路撒冷争战，也必有临到马匹、骡子、骆驼和各样走兽的灾殃；因此剩下的人必上到耶路撒冷。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.13.htm">14:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.16.htm">16</a>）</p><p>飞鸟必憎恶它，地上的各样走兽必诅咒它。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛18.6.htm">18:6</a>）；</p><p>人子啊，你要对长各样翅膀的飞鸟和田地的各样走兽说，你们聚集来到以色列山上献祭之地，我必显我的荣耀在列族中。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.17.htm">39:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.21.htm">21</a>）</p><p>耶和华招聚以色列被赶散的；我田地的诸兽啊，你们都来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛56.8.htm">56:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛56.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>耶和华要毁灭亚述，这民族的各样野兽必卧在其中；鹈鹕和箭猪要宿在她的石榴树中。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.13.htm">2:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.14.htm">14</a>）</p><p>因无牧人，羊就分散，作了田野各样野兽的食物。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.5.htm">34:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.8.htm">8</a>）</p><p>我必将你丢在田间的地面上，使空中的各样飞鸟都落在你身上，使地上的各样走兽因你得饱足。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.4.htm">32:4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结5.17.htm">5:17</a>；<a

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 567</h4><p>567. REVELATION: CHAPTER 13<p>1. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on its horns ten jewels, <sup>1</sup>and on its heads a blasphemous name.<p>2. Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, whose feet were like those of a bear, and its mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave it its power, its throne, and great authority.<p>3. And I saw one of its heads appearing as though fatally wounded, and its mortal injury was healed. And all the earth went marveling after the beast.<p>4. Then they worshiped the dragon which gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast? Who can fight against it?"<p>5. And it was given a mouth speaking great and blasphemous things, and it was given authority to do so for forty-two months.<p>6. Then it opened its mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, and against His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven.<p>7. It was granted it to make war with the saints and overcome them. And it was given authority over every tribe, tongue, and nation.<p>8. All who dwell on the earth will worship it, all whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.<p>9. If anyone has an ear, let him hear.<p>10. Anyone who leads into captivity shall go into captivity; anyone who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.<p>11. Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and it had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon.<p>12. And it exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose mortal injury was healed.<p>13. It also performs great signs, so as to even make fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of men,<p>14. and to lead astray those who dwell on the earth, because of the signs which it was granted to do in the presence of the beast, telling those dwelling upon the earth to make an image of the beast that was injured by the sword and lived.<p>15. It was also granted it to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast might speak and cause whoever does not worship the image of the beast to be killed.<p>16. And it causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive from it a mark on their right hand and on their foreheads,<p>17. so that no one can buy or sell if he does not have the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of its name.<p>18. Here is wisdom: let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and its number is 666.<p>THE SPIRITUAL MEANING<p>The Contents of the Whole Chapter<p>The dragon continues to be the subject in this chapter, which describes the doctrine and faith meant by the dragon. The character of that doctrine and faith among the laity, and then its character among the clergy. The beast rising up out of the sea describes the doctrine and faith among the laity (verses 1-10), and the beast coming up out of the earth the doctrine and faith among the clergy (verses 11-17).<p>Lastly it describes the clergy's falsification of the Word's truth (verse 18).<p>The Contents of the Individual Verses:<p></p><table><thead><tr><th>Verse Contents</th><th>Spiritual Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea,</td><td>The laity in the Protestant Reformed churches who are caught up in the doctrine and faith of the dragon regarding God and salvation.</td></tr><tr><td>having seven heads</td><td>The irrationality resulting from their absolute falsities.</td></tr><tr><td>and ten horns,</td><td>Their great power.</td></tr><tr><td>and on its horns ten jewels, <sup>2</sup></td><td>Their power to falsify many of the Word's truths.</td></tr><tr><td>and on its heads a blasphemous name.</td><td>Their denial of the Lord's Divine humanity and affirmation of their church's doctrine, drawn not from the Word but from their own intelligence.</td></tr><tr><td>2. Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard,</td><td>Their heresy destructive of the church, being founded on the Word's truths falsified,</td></tr><tr><td>whose feet were like those of a bear,</td><td>full of misconceptions taken from the literal sense of the Word, read but not understood.</td></tr><tr><td>and its mouth like the mouth of a lion.</td><td>Their reasonings based on falsities as though on truths.</td></tr><tr><td>And the dragon gave it its power, its throne, and great authority.</td><td>This heresy prevails and reigns as a result of its acceptance by the laity.</td></tr><tr><td>3. And I saw one of its heads appearing as though fatally wounded,</td><td>Their doctrine of faith alone does not accord with the Word, in which works are so often commanded.</td></tr><tr><td>and its mortal injury was healed.</td><td>A remedy for this explained.</td></tr><tr><td>And all the earth went marveling after the beast.</td><td>That doctrine and faith then accepted with joy.</td></tr><tr><td>4. Then they worshiped the dragon which gave authority to the beast;</td><td>Their acknowledgment that the doctrine is such as declared by the leaders of the church and its teachers, who have caused the doctrine to prevail as a result of its acceptance by the general populace.</td></tr><tr><td>and they worshiped the beast,</td><td>An acknowledgment by the general populace that the doctrine is a sacred truth.</td></tr><tr><td>saying, "Who is like the beast? Who can fight against it?"</td><td>The preeminence of that doctrine because no one can dispute it.</td></tr><tr><td>5. And it was given a mouth speaking great and blasphemous things,</td><td>It teaches evils and falsities.</td></tr><tr><td>and it was given authority to do so for forty-two months.</td><td>The scope to teach and practice the evils and falsities accompanying that doctrine even to the end of that church, until the beginning of a new one.</td></tr><tr><td>6. Then it opened its mouth in blasphemies against God and His name,</td><td>Their assertions, which are scandalous, against the Divine itself and the Lord's Divine humanity, and at the same time against everything that the church has from the Word by which the Lord is worshiped.</td></tr><tr><td>and against His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven.</td><td>Scandalous assertions against the Lord's celestial church and against heaven.</td></tr><tr><td>7. It was granted it to make war with the saints and overcome them.</td><td>They attacked the Word's Divine truths and overturned them.</td></tr><tr><td>And it was given authority over every tribe, tongue, and nation.</td><td>Their consequent dominion over everything connected with the church, over everything pertaining to its doctrine and over everything pertaining to its life.</td></tr><tr><td>8. All who dwell on the earth will worship it, all whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb</td><td>They all acknowledged that heresy as a sacred tenet of the church, all but those who believed in the Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>slain from the foundation of the world.</td><td>The Lord's Divine humanity unacknowledged from the inception of the church.</td></tr><tr><td>9. If anyone has an ear, let him hear.</td><td>Let people who wish to be wise pay attention to this.</td></tr><tr><td>10. Anyone who leads into captivity shall go into captivity;</td><td>Someone who uses that heresy to draw others away from believing rightly and living rightly is drawn by his own falsities and evils into hell.</td></tr><tr><td>anyone who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword.</td><td>Someone who uses falsities to destroy another's soul is destroyed by falsities and perishes.</td></tr><tr><td>Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.</td><td>Through the temptations or trials occasioned by these falsities a person of the Lord's New Church is examined to discover his character in respect to his life and faith.</td></tr><tr><td>11. Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth,</td><td>The clergy who are caught up in the dragon's doctrine and faith regarding God and salvation.</td></tr><tr><td>and it had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon.</td><td>They quote the Word in speaking, teaching and writing as though it were the Lord's Divine truth, and yet it is truth falsified.</td></tr><tr><td>12. And it exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence,</td><td>They have defended the dogmas, and the dogmas prevail in consequence of it.</td></tr><tr><td>and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose mortal injury was healed.</td><td>By supporting arguments they have established that what the general populace has accepted be acknowledged as a sacred tenet of the church.</td></tr><tr><td>13. It also performs great signs,</td><td>Testifications that their teachings are true, even though they are false.</td></tr><tr><td>so as to even make fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of men,</td><td>Assertions that their falsities are true.</td></tr><tr><td>14. and to lead astray those who dwell on the earth, because of the signs which it was granted to do in the presence of the beast,</td><td>Through their testifications and assertions they lead people in the church into errors.</td></tr><tr><td>telling those dwelling upon the earth to make an image of the beast that was injured by the sword and lived.</td><td>They induce people in the church to accept as doctrine that faith is the only means of salvation, for the reason stated.</td></tr><tr><td>15. It was also granted it to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast might speak</td><td>They were permitted to use the Word to defend the doctrine, so as to cause the doctrine to be seemingly animated by it.</td></tr><tr><td>and cause whoever does not worship the image of the beast to be killed.</td><td>They pronounce damnation on people who do not acknowledge their doctrine of faith as a sacred doctrine of the church.</td></tr><tr><td>16. And it causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave,</td><td>All the people in Protestant Reformed church, of whatever condition, degree of education, or degree of intelligence.</td></tr><tr><td>to receive from it a mark on their right hand and on their foreheads,</td><td>No one is acknowledged as a Protestant Reformed Christian but one who accepts that doctrine in faith and love.</td></tr><tr><td>17. so that no one can buy or sell if he does not have the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of its name.</td><td>No one allowed to teach from the Word but one who acknowledges that doctrine and swears to a belief in it and love for it, and to such as is in conformity with it.</td></tr><tr><td>18.

The same faith continues to be the subject in this chapter, and the beast here that John saw rising up out of the sea means that faith among the laity, whereas the beast from the earth, described in verse <a href="3927/revelation_13_11.htm">11</a>, means that faith among the clergy.<p>That the dragon continues to be the subject here is apparent from the following statements in this chapter: that the dragon gave to the beast rising up out of the sea its power, its throne, and great authority (verse 2); that they worshiped the dragon which gave authority to the beast (verse 4); and, concerning the beast coming up out of the earth, that it spoke like a dragon (verse 11); and that it exercised all the authority of the first beast in the presence of the dragon (verse 12).<p>The laity are the people meant by the beast from the sea, and the clergy those meant by the beast from the earth, because the sea symbolizes the outer aspect of the church, and the land its inner aspect (no. <a href="398.htm">398</a> and elsewhere); and the laity are concerned with the external elements of the church's doctrine, while the clergy are concerned with its internal elements. That is why the beast from the earth is later called a false prophet. <sup>3</sup><p>That they are people in the Protestant Reformed churches is because the Protestant Reformed are the subject to the end of chapter 16, while Roman Catholics are the subject in chapters 17, 18. Then the subject after that is the Last Judgment and finally the New Church.</p><p>[2] These people were seen as beasts because the dragon is a beast, and because a beast in the Word symbolizes a person in respect to his affections - harmless and useful beasts a person in respect to good affections, and harmful and useless ones a person in respect to evil affections. People of the church are in general called sheep, therefore, and a company of them a flock, and one who teaches is called a shepherd.<p>That is also why the Word in respect to its power, affection, understanding and wisdom is described above in chapter four by four living creatures - a lion, a calf, an eagle and a human being - and an understanding of the Word by horses in chapter six.<p>The reason is that in the spiritual world a person's affections look at a distance like animals, as we have often said before; and regarded in themselves, animals are no more than embodiments of natural affections, while people are embodiments not only of natural affections, but also at the same time of spiritual affections.</p><p>[3] That animals mean people in respect to their affections can be seen from the following passages:<p>You... will cause to fall a kindly rain.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 567</h4><p>567. THE THIRTEENTH CHAPTER<p>1. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.<p>2. And the beast that I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet as [the feet] of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion; and the dragon gave him his vigour, and his throne, and great authority.<p>3. And I saw one of his heads as if wounded to death, and the stroke of his death was healed; and the whole land went in admiration after the beast.<p>4. And they adored the dragon who gave authority to the beast, and they adored the beast, saving, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to fight with him?<p>5. And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and there was given unto him authority to act for forty-two months.<p>6. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His Name, and His tabernacle, and those dwelling in heaven.<p>7. And it was given unto him to wage war with the saints, and to overcome them, and authority was given him over every tribe and tongue and nation.<p>8. And all dwelling upon the land shall adore him, whose names have not been written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.<p>9. If anyone has an ear, let him hear.<p>10. If anyone leads a captivity, he shall go into captivity; if anyone slays with the sword, he must be slain with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.<p>11. And I saw another beast coming up out of the land, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he was speaking as a dragon.<p>12. And he exercises all the authority of the former beast in his presence, and causes the land and those dwelling therein to adore the former beast, the stroke of whose death was healed.<p>13. And he does great signs, so that he also makes fire come down out of heaven into the land in the presence of men.<p>14. And he leads astray those dwelling upon the land, on account of the signs that were given him to enact in the presence of the beast, telling those dwelling upon the land to make an image to the beast, which has the stroke of the sword and did live.<p>15. And it was given him to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast may both speak and enact, that everyone who does not adore the image of the beast may be slain.<p>16. And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond, that he give them a mark upon their right hand and upon their foreheads.<p>17. And that no one can buy or sell, if he does not have the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.<p>18. Here is wisdom. Let one having intelligence compute the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.<p>THE SPIRITUAL SENSE<p>THE CONTENTS OF THE WHOLE CHAPTER<p>In this chapter there is a continuation Concerning the dragon, and the doctrine and faith that are understood by it are described; what it is like with the laity, and afterwards what it is like with the clergy.<p>By 'the beast coming up out of the sea' is described that doctrine and faith with the laity (from verses 1-10); and by 'the beast out of the land' that [doctrine and faith] with the clergy (verses 11-17); then concerning the falsification of the truth of the Word by the latter (verse 18).<p>THE CONTENTS OF EACH OF THE VERSES<p>1. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, signifies the laity in the Churches of the Reformed who are in the doctrine and faith of the dragon concerning God and salvation.<p>Having seven heads, signifies the insanity resulting from sheer untruths.<p>And ten horns, signifies great power.<p>And upon his horns ten diadems, signifies the power of falsifying many truths of the Word.<p>And upon his heads the name of blasphemy, signifies the denial of the Lord's Divine Human, and the doctrine of the Church not derived from the Word but hatched out of self-intelligence.<p>2. And the beast that I saw was like a leopard, signifies a heresy destructive of the Church, because derived from truths of the Word falsified.<p>And his feet as [the feet] of a bear, signifies full of fallacies derived from the sense of the letter of the Word read but not understood.<p>And his mouths as the mouth of a lion, signifies reasonings derived from untruths as if from truths.<p>And the dragon gave him his vigour, and his throne, and great authority, signifies that this heresy is prevalent and reigning through reception by the laity.<p>3. And I saw one of his heads as if wounded to deaths, signifies that the doctrine of faith alone is not in agreement with the Word, where works are so often commanded.<p>And the stroke of his death was healed, signifies the healing thereof on account of this.<p>And the whole land went in admiration after the beast, signifies that then that doctrine and faith was received with joy.<p>4. And they adored the dragon who gave authority to the beast, signifies the acknowledgment that it is such as has been given by the leaders and teachers, who have caused its prevalence through reception by the community at large.<p>And they adored the beast, signifies the acknowledgment by the community at large that it is a holy truth (veritas) [that no one can do a good work by himself, nor fulfil the law].<p>Saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to fight with him?, signifies the superiority of that doctrine, because it cannot be contradicted by anyone.<p>5. And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, signifies that it is teaching evils and untruths.<p>And there was given unto him authority to act for forty-two months, signifies the opportunity for teaching and doing the evils and untruths of that doctrine up to the end of that Church, until the beginning of the New.<p>6. [And he opened his mouths in blasphemy against God, and His Name, signifies their sayings, which are scandals against the Lord's Divine Itself and Divine Human, and at the same the against everything of the Church derived from the Word, by means of which the Lord is worshipped.]<p>And His tabernacle and those dwelling in heaven, signifies scandals against the Lord's celestial Church and against heaven.<p>7. And it was given unto him to wage war with the saints and to overcome them, signifies that they have fought against the Divine truths of the Word and overthrown them.<p>And authority was given him over every tribe and tongue and nation, signifies consequent dominion over all things of the Church both those of its doctrine and those of its life.<p>8. And all dwelling upon the land shall adore him, whose names have not been written in the book of life of the Lamb, signifies that all have acknowledged that heretical [doctrine] as a holy thing of the Church, except those who have believed in the Lord.<p>Slain from the foundation of the world, signifies the Lord's Divine Human not acknowledged from the setting up of the Church.<p>9. If anyone has an ear, let him hear, signifies that those who wish to be wise pay attention to these things.<p>10. If anyone leads a captivity he shall go into captivity, signifies that he who by means of this heretical [doctrine] leads others away from believing well and living well is led away by his own evils and untruths into hell.<p>If anyone slays with the sword, he must be slain with the sword, signifies that he who by means of untruths has destroyed the soul of another is destroyed by untruths and perishes.<p>[Here is the patience and faith of the saints, signifies that the man of the Lord's New Church by means of temptations from those [untruths and evils] is examined as to the quality of his life and faith.]<p>And I saw another beast coming up out of the land, signifies the clergy who are in the doctrine and faith of the dragon concerning God and salvation.<p>And he had two horns like a Lamb, and he was speaking as a dragon, signifies that they speak, teach and write out of the Word as if it were the Lord's Divine Truth, but still it is truths falsified.<p>12. And he exercises all the authority of the former beast in his presence, signifies that they have confirmed the dogmas and by this are influential.<p>And causes the land and those dwelling in it to adore the former beast, the stroke of whose deaths was healed, signifies that as a result of the confirmations it has been established that what has been received by the community at large should be acknowledged as a holy thing of the Church.<p>13. And he does great signs, signifies testifications that the things that they teach are true, although they are untrue.<p>So that he also makes fire come down out of heaven into the land in the presence of men, signifies attestations that their untruths are true.<p>14. And he leads astray those dwelling upon the land on account of the signs that were given him to enact in the presence of the beast, signifies that by testifications and attestations they lead the men of the Church into errors.<p>Telling those dwelling upon the land to make an image to the beast, which has the stroke of the sword and did live, signifies that they induce the men of the Church to receive as a doctrine, that faith is the one and only means of salvation, for the reasons stated.<p>15. And it was given him to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast may both speak, signifies that it was permitted them to confirm that doctrine by means of the Word, whereby it is taught as if made alive.<p>And enact that everyone who does not adore the image of the beast may be slain, signifies that they pronounce damnation upon those who do not acknowledge the doctrine of their faith as a holy doctrine of the Church.<p>16. And he causes all the small and the great and the rich and the poor and the free and the bond, signifies all in that Church of whatever condition, learning, and intelligence they are.<p>That he give them a mark upon their right hand and upon their foreheads, signifies that no one is acknowledged as a Reformed Christian unless he receives that doctrine in faith and love.<p>17. And that no one can buy or sell if he does not have the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name, signifies that no one is allowed to teach out of the Word unless he acknowledges that [doctrine], and swears to a faith and love of it, or to something that agrees with it.<p>18. Here is wisdom, signifies that it is the part of a wise man, in consequence of the things that have been stated and expounded in this chapter, to see and understand what the doctrine and faith with the clergy is like concerning God and salvation.<p>Let one having intelligence compute the number of the beast, signifies that he who is in enlightenment from the Lord is able to recognise what the confirmation of that doctrine and faith out of the Word is like with them.<p>For it is the number of a man, signifies the quality of the Word and consequently of the Church.<p>His number is six hundred and sixty-six, signifies this quality, that every truth of the Word has been falsified by them.<p>THE EXPOSITION<p>[verse 1] 'And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea' signifies the laity in the Churches of the Reformed who are in the doctrine and faith of the dragon concerning God and salvation. What the faith of the dragon is, and what it is like, may be seen (<a href="537.htm">537</a>). In this chapter there is a continuation concerning the same faith; and by this ' beast,' which was seen to come up out of the sea,' is understood that faith with the laity, but by 'the beast out of the land,' mentioned in verse 11, is understood that faith with the clergy. That there is a continuation here concerning 'the dragons' is plain from these things in this chapter:<p>That the dragon gave the beast coming up out of the sea his vigour, and throne, and great authority (verse 2). And that they adored the dragon who gave authority to the beast (verse 4).<p>And of the beast out of the land, that he spoke like the dragon (verse 11).<p>And that he exercised all the authority of the former beast in the presence of the dragon (verse 12).<p>The reason why the laity are understood by 'the beast out of the sea' and the clergy by 'the beast out of the land' is because by 'the sea' is signified the external of the Church and by 'the land' its internal (<a href="398.htm">398</a>, and elsewhere), and the laity are in the external things of the doctrine of the Church, while the clergy are in the internal things thereof. Therefore also 'the beast out of the land' in the things following is called 'the false prophet.' They are [the clergy and the laity who are in the Churches of the Reformed, because it treats of the Reformed as far as chapter <a href="3927/revelation_16_1.htm">16</a> inclusive, and of the Roman Catholics in chapters <a href="3927/revelation_17_1.htm">17</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_18_1.htm">18</a>, and afterwards of the last judgment, and then and not till then of the New Church.</p><p>[2] They were seen as 'beasts' because a dragon is a beast, and because 'a beast' in the Word signifies a man as to his affections, harmless and useful beasts signifying him as to good affections, and hurtful and useless beasts as to evil affections. On this account the men of the Church in general are termed 'sheep,' and an assembly of them 'a flock,' and one teaching is called a shepherd (pastor). This also is why the Word as to its power, affection, understanding and wisdom is described above by the 'four animals,' which were 'a lion, a calf, an eagle and a man' (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_4_1.htm">4</a>), and that the understanding of the Word is described by 'horses' (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_6_1.htm">6</a>). This is because a man's affections in the spiritual world appear from afar off as beasts, as has often been said before, and beasts regarded in themselves are nothing but the forms of natural affections, whereas men are not only forms of natural, but also at the same time of spiritual, affections.</p><p>[3] That men as to affections are understood by 'beasts' can be established from the following passages:<p>Thou makest <sup>1</sup>a rain of kindnesses to drop, Thou shalt confirm Thy labouring inheritance, the beast of Thine assembly shall dwell therein. <a href="3927/psalms_68_9.htm">Psalms 68:9-10</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_68_10.htm">10-11</a>].<p>Every wild beast of the forest is Mine, the beasts on a thousand mountains, I know every bird of the mountains, the beasts of My fields are Mine. <a href="3927/psalms_50_10.htm">Psalms 50:10</a>.<p>Asshur is a cedar in Lebanon, he has become of high stature, in his branches all the birds of the heavens have made their nests, and under his branches all the beasts of the held have brought forth, and in his shade all the great nations have dwelt. <a href="3927/ezekiel_31_3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-6</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_31_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_31_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_4_10.htm">Daniel 4:10-16</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/daniel_4_7.htm">7-13</a>].<p>I will make a covenant with them in that day with the beast of the field and within the bird of the heavens, and I will betroth thee unto Me to eternity, <a href="3927/hosea_2_18.htm">Hosea 2:18-19</a>.<p>Rejoice and be glad, be not afraid O beasts of My fields, for the habitations of the wilderness have become full of vegetation. <a href="3927/joel_2_21.htm">Joel 2:21-23</a>.<p>In that day there shall be a great tumult, Judah shall fight against Jerusalem, and there shall be a plague of horse, mule, camel, and every beast; therefore shall every one that is left go up to Jerusalem, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_13.htm">Zechariah 14:13-16</a>.<p>They shall regard him as a bird of ill omen (abominabuntur eum avis), and every beast of the land shall condemn him. <a href="3927/isaiah_18_6.htm">Isaiah 18:6</a>.<p>Thou, son of man, say to the bird of every wing, and to every beast of the field, Gather yourselves to My sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel; thus will I give My glory among the nations. <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17-21</a>.<p>Jehovah gathers the outcasts of Israel.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 567</h4><p>567. Revelation 13<p>1. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.<p>2. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet like a bear's, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion; and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.<p>3. And I saw one of his heads as if wounded to death; and the stroke of his death was healed; and the whole earth wondered after the beast.<p>4. And they adored the dragon, which gave authority to the beast; and they adored the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to fight with him?<p>5. And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and there was given unto him authority to work forty-two months.<p>6. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, and His tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.<p>7. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them; and there was given him authority over every tribe and tongue and nation.<p>8. And all that dwell on the earth shall adore Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.<p>9. If anyone hath an ear let him hear.<p>10. If anyone shall lead into captivity he shall go into captivity, if anyone shall kill with the sword, he must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.<p>11. And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.<p>12. And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast before him, and he causeth the earth and them that dwell therein to adore the first beast, whose stroke of his death was healed.<p>13. And he doeth great signs, so that he also maketh fire to come down from heaven unto the earth before men.<p>14. And he seduceth them that dwell upon the earth, on account of the signs which were given for him to do before the beast; saying to them that dwell upon the earth, that they should make an image to the beast which hath the stroke of the sword and did live.<p>15. And it was given unto him to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast may both speak, and cause that as many as do not adore the image of the beast should be killed.<p>16. And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond, that he should give them a mark upon their right hand, and upon their foreheads.<p>17. And that no one could buy or sell, if he hath not the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.<p>18. Here is wisdom. He that hath intelligence let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred sixty-six.<p>THE SPIRITUAL SENSE<p>The contents of the whole chapter<p>In this chapter the dragon continues to be treated of, and the doctrine and faith which is meant by it is described; what its quality is with the laity, and afterwards what its quality is with the clergy: by "the beast coming up out of the sea," that doctrine and faith with the laity is described (verses <a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">1-10</a>); and by "the beast out of the earth," the same with the clergy (verses <a href="3927/revelation_13_11.htm">11-17</a>): lastly, concerning the falsification of the truth of the Word by the latter (verse <a href="3927/revelation_13_18.htm">18</a>).<p>The contents of each verse.<p>Verse 1. "And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea" signifies the laity in the churches of the Reformed, who are principled in the doctrine and faith of the dragon concerning God and salvation: "Having seven heads" signifies insanity arising from mere falsities: "And ten horns" signifies much power: "And upon his horns ten diadems" signifies the power of falsifying many truths of the Word: "And upon his heads the name of blasphemy" signifies denial of the Lord's Divine Human, and doctrine of the church not drawn from the Word, but from self-derived intelligence. Verse 2. "And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard" signifies a heresy destructive of the church because derived from truths of the Word falsified: "And his feet like a bear's" signifies full of fallacies from the literal sense of the Word read but not understood: "And his mouth as the mouth of a lion" signifies reasonings from falsities as if from truths: "And the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority" signifies that this heresy prevails and reigns in consequence of its reception by the laity. Verse 3. "And I saw one of his heads as if wounded to death" signifies that the doctrine of faith alone does not accord with the Word, in which works are so often enjoined: "And the stroke of his death was healed" signifies the remedy applied on this account: "And the whole earth wondered after the beast" signifies that then this doctrine and faith was gladly received. Verse 4. "And they adored the dragon which gave authority to the beast" signifies the acknowledgment that it is such as is laid down by the leaders and teachers, who have established its authority on the reception they have procured for it among the community at large: "And they adored the beast" signifies the acknowledgment on the part of the community that it is holy truth: "Saying, who is like unto the beast? Who is able to fight with him?" signifies the excellence of that doctrine, because it cannot be contradicted by anyone. Verse 5. "And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies" signifies that it teaches what is evil and false: "And there was given unto him authority to work forty-two months" signifies the liberty of teaching and doing the evils and falsities of that doctrine, even to the end of that church and the beginning of the new. Verse 6. "And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name" signifies their sayings, which are scandals against the essential Divinity and Divine Human of the Lord, and at the same time against everything relating to the church derived from the Word, whereby the Lord is worshiped: "And his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven" signifies scandals against the Lord's celestial kingdom and against heaven. Verse 7. "And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them," signifies that they have impugned the Divine truths of the Word, and cast them down to the ground: "And there was given him authority over every tribe and tongue and nation" signifies consequent dominion over all things of the church, both as to its doctrine and as to its life. Verse 8. "And all that dwell on the earth shall adore him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb" signifies that all acknowledged that heretical doctrine as holy in the church, except those who believed in the Lord: "Slain from the foundation of the world" signifies the Lord's Divine Human not acknowledged from the first establishment of the church. Verse 9. "If anyone hath an ear let him hear" signifies that they should attend to this who desire to attain wisdom. Verse 10. "If anyone shall lead into captivity he shall go into captivity" signifies that he who by means of this heretical doctrine misleads others from believing well and living well, will himself be drawn into hell by his own evils and falsities: "If anyone shall kill with the sword he must be killed with the sword" signifies that he who by means of falsities destroys the soul of another, is himself destroyed by falsities, and perishes: "Here is the patience and the faith of the saints" signifies that the man of the Lord's New Church, by temptations from such things, is explored as to the quality of his life and faith. Verse 11. "And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth" signifies the clergy who are principled in the doctrine and faith of the dragon concerning God and salvation: "And he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon" signifies that what they say, teach, and write is from the Word, as though it were the Lord's Divine truth, and yet it is truth falsified. Verse 12. "And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast before him" signifies that they confirmed these tenets, which thence derive their authority: "And he causeth the earth and them that dwell therein to adore the first beast whose stroke of his death was healed" signifies that from their being received by the community at large, it is established and confirmed that they ought to be acknowledged and held sacred in the church. Verse 13. "And he doeth great signs" signifies testifications that the things they teach are true, although they are false: "So that he also maketh fire to come down from heaven unto the earth before men" signifies attestations that their falsities are truths. Verse 14. "And he seduceth them that dwell upon the earth, on account of the signs, which were given him to do before the beast" signifies that by their testifications and attestations they lead the men of the church into errors: "Saying to them that dwell upon the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which hath the stroke of a sword and did live" signifies that they induce the men of the church to receive for doctrine, that faith is the only medium of salvation, for the reasons already mentioned. Verse 15. "And it was given unto him to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast may both speak" signifies that it was permitted them to confirm that doctrine by means of the Word, whereby it does as it were receive life when it is taught: "And cause that as many as do not adore the image of the beast should be killed" signifies that they denounce damnation against those who do not acknowledge their doctrine of faith to be the holy doctrine of the church. Verse 16. "And he causeth all, both the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond" signifies all in that church, whatsoever may be their condition, learning, and intelligence: "That he should give them a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads" signifies that no one is acknowledged to be a Reformed Christian unless he receives that doctrine in faith and love (verse <a href="3927/revelation_13_17.htm">17</a>). "And that no one could buy or sell, if he hath not the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name" signifies that it is not lawful for anyone to teach from the Word, unless he acknowledges it, and swears to the belief and love thereof, or to something which amounts to the same. Verse 18. "Here is wisdom" signifies that it is the part of a wise man, from what had been said and explained in this chapter, to see and understand the nature of the doctrine and faith of the clergy respecting God and salvation: "He that hath intelligence let him count the number of the beast" signifies that he who is in illumination from the Lord, may know the nature and quality of the proofs they produce from the Word in confirmation of that doctrine and faith: "For it is the number of a man" signifies the quality of the Word and thence of the church: "And his number is six hundred sixty-six" signifies this quality, that all the truth of the Word is falsified by them.<p>THE EXPLANATION<p>Verse 1. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, signifies the laity in the churches of the Reformed who are in the doctrine and faith of the dragon concerning God and salvation. What the faith of the dragon is, and its quality, may be seen, (<a href="537.htm">537</a>). The same faith continues to be treated of in this chapter; and by this "beast" which "was seen to come up out of the sea," is meant that faith with the laity; but by "the beast out of the earth" (mentioned at verse 11), is meant that faith with the clergy. That the dragon continues to be treated of here is evident from these things in this chapter; that "the dragon gave the beast coming up out of the sea his power, and throne, and great authority" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_13_2.htm">2</a>); and that "they adored the dragon which gave authority to the beast" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_13_4.htm">4</a>); and of "the beast from the earth, that he spoke like the dragon" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_13_11.htm">11</a>); and that he exerciseth all the authority of the former beast before the dragon (verse <a href="3927/revelation_13_12.htm">12</a>). The reason why the laity are meant by "the beast out of the sea," and the clergy by "the beast out of the earth," is because by "the sea" is signified the external of the church, and by "the earth" its internal, (<a href="398.htm">398</a>, and in other places); and the laity are in the externals of the doctrine of the church, and the clergy are in its internals; on this account "the beast out of the earth" is also called, in what follows, "the false prophet." That they who are in the churches of the Reformed are meant, is because the Reformed are treated of as far as chapter 16 inclusive, and the Roman Catholics in chapters 17, 18, and afterwards the last judgment, and finally the new church.</p><p>[2] They were seen as "beasts," because a dragon is a beast, and because "a beast" in the Word signifies man as to his affections; harmless and useful beasts signify man as to good affections, and noxious and useless beasts signify man as to his evil affections; on which account the men of the church in general are called "sheep," and a congregation of them, "a flock," and their teacher is called "a pastor."<p>Hence also it is that the Word as to its power, affection, understanding, and wisdom, is described above, by "four animals," which were "a lion, a calf, an eagle, and a man" (Revelation 4); and that the understanding of the Word is described by "horses" (Revelation 6). The reason is because the affections of a man, in the spiritual world, appear at a distance as beasts, as has been stated before; and beasts, considered in themselves, are nothing but forms of natural affections, but men are not only forms of natural, but of spiritual affections at the same time.</p><p>[3] That men, as to their affections, are meant by "beasts," may appear from these passages:<p>Thou didst cause a bountiful rain to drop, thou didst confirm thy inheritance, when it was laboring; the beast of thy assembly shall dwell in it, (<a href="3927/psalms_68_9.htm">Psalms 68:9-10</a>).<p>Every wild beast of the forest is mine, the beasts upon a thousand mountains.

Et Vidi ex Mari Bestiam ascendentem, habentem capita septem, et cornua decem, et super cornubus suis decem diademata, et super capitibus suis nomen blasphemiae. <p>2. Et Bestia, quam vidi, erat similis pardo, et pedes ejus sicut ursi, et os ejus sicut os leonis; et dedit illi Draco virtutem suam, et thronum suum, et potestatem magnam. <p>3. Et vidi unum capitum ejus sicut sauciatum in mortem, et plaga mortis ejus sanata est; et admirata est tota terra post Bestiam. <p>4. Et adoraverunt Draconem, qui dedit potestatem Bestiae, et adoraverunt Bestiam, dicentes, Quis similis est Bestiae, quis potest pugnare cum ea. <p>5. Et datum ei os loquens magna et blasphemias, et data ei potestas faciendi menses quadraginta duos. <p>6. Et aperuit os suum in blasphemiam adversus Deum, blasphemare Nomen Ipsius, et Tabernaculum Ipsius, et eos in Caelo habitantes. <p>7. Et datum ei bellum facere cum sanctis, et vincere illos; et data ei potestas super omnem tribum et linguam et gentem. <p>8. Et adorabunt eam omnes habitantes super terra, quorum non scripta nomina in Libro vitae Agni, occisi a fundatione mundi. <p>9. Si quis habet aurem audiat. <p>10. Si quis captivitatem duxerit, in captivitatem abibit; si quis machaera occiderit, oportet eum machaera occidi: hic est patientia et fides sanctorum. <p>11. Et vidi aliam Bestiam ascendentem e Terra, et habebat cornua duo similia Agno, et loquebatur sicut Draco. <p>12. Et potestatem prioris Bestiae omnem facit coram illo, et facit ut terra et habitantes in illa adorent Bestiam priorem, cujus sanata est plaga mortis ejus. <p>13. Et facit signa magna, ut et ignem faciat descendere e Caelo in terram coram hominibus; <p>14. Et seducat habitantes super terra, propter signa quae data ei facere coram Bestia, dicens habitantibus super terra facere imaginem Bestiae, quae habet plagam machaerae et vixit. <p>15. Et datum ei dare spiritum imagini Bestiae, ut et loquatur imago Bestiae, et faciat ut quicunque non adorant imaginem Bestiae occidantur. <p>16. Et facit omnes parvos et magnos, et divites et pauperes, et liberos et servos, ut det illis characterem super manu eorum dextra et super frontibus eorum. <p>17. Et ut nemo possit emere aut vendere, si non habet characterem aut nomen Bestiae, aut numerum nominis ejus. <p>18.

"Hic sapientia est," significat quod sapientis sit ex illis quae in hoc capite dicta et explicata sunt, videre et intelligere, qualis est doctrina et fides de Deo et de Salvatione apud Clericos (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_567/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_607" target=_top>607</a>); "habens intelligentiam computet numerum Bestiae," significat quod qui in illustratione a Domino est, cognoscere possit quale confirmationum istius doctrinae et fidei ex Verbo apud illos (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_567/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_608" target=_top>608</a>); "numerus enim hominis est," significat quale Verbi et inde Ecclesiae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_567/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_609" target=_top>609</a>); "numerus ejus sexcenta sexaginta sex," significat quale hoc, quod ab illis omne verum Verbi falsificatum sit (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_567/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_610" target=_top>610</a>) <p>EXPLICATIO. <p>(Vers. 1) "Et vidi ex Mari Bestiam ascendentem," significat Laicos in Ecclesiis Reformatorum, qui in doctrina et fide Draconis sunt de Deo et de Salvatione. - Quid et qualis fides Draconis, videatur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_567/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_537" target=_top>537</a>). De eadem fide continuatur in hoc capite; et per "hanc Bestiam," quae "visa est ascendere ex Mari," intelligitur illa fides apud Laicos, at per "Bestiam ex terra" (de qua vers. 11), intelligitur illa fides apud Clericos. Quod continuetur hic de Dracone, patet ex his in hoc capite: quod "Draco dederit Bestiae ascendenti ex Mari virtutem suam, et thronum, et potestatem magnam," (vers. 2); et quod "adoraverint Draconem, qui dedit potestatem Bestiae," (vers. 4) et de "Bestia ex Terra," quod illa "locuta sit sicut Draco," (vers. 11); et quod "potestatem prioris Bestiae omnem fecerit coram Dracone," (vers. 12). Quod sint Laici qui per "Bestiam ex Mari" intelliguntur, et Clerici qui per "Bestiam ex Terra," est quia per "mare" significatur Externum Ecclesiae, ac per "terram" Internum ejus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_567/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_398" target=_top>398</a>, et alibi); ac in externis doctrinae Ecclesiae sunt Laici, et in internis ejus sunt Clerici; quare etiam "Bestia ex Terra" in sequentibus vocatur" Pseudopropheta." Quod sint qui in Ecclesiis Reformatorum, est quia de Reformatis agitur usque ad cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_567/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_16_1-21" target=_top>16</a>, inclusive, et de Romano Catholicis cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_567/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_17_1-18" target=_top>17</a> et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_567/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_18_1-24" target=_top>18</a>; et postea de Ultimo Judicio, et demum de Nova Ecclesia. Quod visi sint ut "Bestiae," est quia Draco est bestia, et quia "bestia" in Verbo significat hominem quoad ejus affectiones, bestiae innocuae et utiles illum quoad affectiones bonas, ac bestiae noxiae et inutiles illum quoad affectiones malas; quare homines Ecclesiae in genere dicuntur "oves," ac caetus ex illis "grex," et docens vocatur "pastor." Inde etiam est quod Verbum quoad ejus potentiam, affectionem, intellectum et sapientiam, supra describatur per "quatuor Animalia," quae erant "Leo, Vitulus, Aquila et Homo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_567/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_4_1-11" target=_top>4</a>); <sup>2</sup>et quod Intellectus Verbi per "Equos," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_567/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_6_1-17" target=_top>6</a>). Causa est, quia affectiones hominis in mundo spirituali e longinquo apparent sicut bestiae, ut prius saepius dictum est; ac bestiae in se spectatae non sunt nisi quam formae affectionum naturalium, homines autem non solum sunt formae affectionum naturalium, sed etiam simul spiritualium. Quod homines quoad affectiones intelligantur per "bestias," constare potest ex his locis: <p>"Pluviam benevolentiarum stillare facis <sup>3</sup>haereditatem Tuam laborantem confirmabis, Bestia (Caetus Tuus) habitabunt in ea," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_567/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_68_10-11" target=_top>Psalm 68:10-11</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_567/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_68_9-10" target=_top>9-10</a>));<p>"Mihi omnis Fera sylvae, Bestiae in montibus millium;
