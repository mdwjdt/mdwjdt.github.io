<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第555节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>555.启12:11.“他们胜过他，是因羔羊的血，和他们所见证的道”表凭圣言的神性真理，因而凭对主为天地之神，以及十诫是人必须照之生活的生活戒律的承认而得胜。“羔羊的血”是指从主发出的神性真理，也就是圣言的神性真理（参看<a href="379.htm">379</a>节）；“见证”是指神性真理（<a href="6.htm">6</a>，<a href="16.htm">16</a>节），特别在于这二者：主是天地之神，十诫是生活的戒律（<a href="490.htm">490</a>，<a href="506.htm">506</a>节）；由于这个原因，十诫也被称为“见证”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.22.htm">25:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.7.htm">31:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.15.htm">32:15</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.13.htm">16:13</a>；那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿17.4.htm">17:4</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.5.htm">78:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗132.12.htm">132:12</a>）。如今，那些陷入唯信的人以为此处“羔羊的血”是指主的十字架受难，这是因为他们使主的十架受难成为他们的首要信条，声称主由此将律法的谴罚转到自己身上，令父满意，使人类与祂和好等等。然而，事实并非如此，主降世是为了征服地狱并荣耀祂的人性，而十字架受难是最后的争战，祂凭此战完全服地狱，并完全荣耀祂的人性，这可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》（<a href="../lord/12.htm">12</a>-14节）。由此可见，“羔羊的血”在此不是指现代教条所说的十字架受难。“羔羊的血”表示从主发出的神性真理，也就是圣言的神性真理；这一点从以下事实明显看出来：主就是圣言；并且由于祂就是圣言，故其中的神性真理就是祂的血，其中的神性良善就是祂的肉或身体。以下教导会使这一点显得更清晰：每个人不就是他自己的良善和他自己的真理吗？并且由于良善属于意愿，真理属于认知或理解力，故每个人就是他自己的意愿和他自己的认知或理解力。还有什么构成一个人呢？就其本质而言，人不就是这二者吗？不过，主就是良善本身和真理本身，也就是神性良善和神性真理，这二者也就是圣言。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 555</h4><p>555. "And they overcame it by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony." (<a href="3927/revelation_12_11.htm">12:11</a>) This symbolizes victory gained by the Divine truth of the Word and thus by an acknowledgment that the Lord is God of heaven and earth and that the Ten Commandments are commandments for life in accordance with which a person should live.<p>It may be seen in no. <a href="379.htm">379</a> above that the blood of the Lamb is the Divine truth emanating from the Lord, which is the Divine truth of the Word; in nos. <a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="16.htm">16</a> above, that the testimony is Divine truth; and in nos. <a href="490.htm">490</a>, <a href="506.htm">506</a>, that it is in particular these two tenets, that the Lord is God of heaven and earth, and that the Ten Commandments are commandments to be lived. The Ten Commandments are also accordingly called the testimony in <a href="3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_31_7.htm">31:7</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_31_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_32_15.htm">32:15</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_16_13.htm">Leviticus 16:13</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_17_4.htm">Numbers 17:4</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_78_5.htm">Psalms 78:5</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_132_12.htm">132:12</a>.<p>People caught up in faith alone today believe that the blood of the Lamb refers to the Lord's suffering of the cross, principally because they make the Lord's suffering of the cross the chief tenet of their dogma, saying that by this He took upon Himself the condemnation of the Law, made satisfaction to the Father, and reconciled to Him the human race, and so on.<p>But that is not the case. Rather the Lord came into the world to conquer the hells and glorify His humanity, and His suffering of the cross was the last battle by which He completely overcame the hells and completely glorified His humanity, as may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord, nos. <a href="../lord/12.htm">12-14</a>.<p>Consequently it can be seen that the blood of the Lamb does not mean here the suffering of the cross as maintained by current dogma.<p>That the blood of the Lamb means the Divine truth emanating from the Lord, which is the Divine truth of the Word, can be seen from the fact that the Lord embodies the Word, and that because He embodies the Word, the Divine truth in it is His blood, and the Divine goodness in it His body.<p>This may be clearly shown by asking whether everyone does not embody his own goodness and his own truth. And because goodness is a matter of the will, and truth a matter of the intellect, whether everyone does not embody his own will and his own intellect. What else constitutes the person? Is not a person in essence these two entities? The Lord, however, is goodness itself and truth itself, or Divine good and Divine truth, and these two also constitute the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 555</h4><p>555. [verse 11] 'And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony' signifies victory by the Divine Truth of the Word, and consequently by the acknowledgment that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that the precepts of the Decalogue are the precepts of life in accordance with which one must live. That 'the blood of the Lamb' is the Divine Truth proceeding from the Lord, which is the Divine Truth of the Word, may be seen above (<a href="379.htm">379</a>); that 'the testimony' is the Divine Truth (Veritas), above (<a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="16.htm">16</a>); and that specifically these two [witnesses] are that the Lord is the God of heaven and earths, and that the precepts of the Decalogue are precepts of life (<a href="490.htm">490</a>, <a href="501.htm">501</a>). On this account the Decalogue is also called 'the testimony' (<a href="3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_31_7.htm">31:7</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_31_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_32_15.htm">32:15</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_16_13.htm">Leviticus 16:13</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_17_4.htm">Numbers 17:4</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_78_5.htm">Psalms 78:5</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_132_12.htm">132:12</a>). By those of the present day who are in faith alone it is believed that here by 'the blood of the Lamb' is understood the Lord's passion of the cross. This is especially the result of their making the Lord's passion of the cross the chief point of their dogma by saying that thereby He has transferred upon Himself the damnation of the law, made satisfaction to the Father and reconciled the human race to Himself, and more besides. That this, however, is not the case, but that:<p>The Lord came into the world in order to subjugate the hells and glorify His Human, and that the passion of the cross was the last combat, by which He fully conquered the hells and fully glorified His Human, may be seen [in] <a href="../lord/12.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord 12-14</a>). Consequently it can be seen that by 'the blood of the Lamb' here is not understood the passion of the cross in accordance with present-day dogma. That the Divine Truth proceeding out of the Lord, which is the Divine Truth of the Word, is understood by 'the blood of the Lamb' can be seen by reason of this, that the Lord is the Word, and because He is the Word the Divine Truth there is His Blood and the Divine Good is His Body. For clearness this can be taught thus: Is not every man his own good and his own truth, and because good is of the will and truths is of the understanding every man is his own will and his own understanding? What else makes a man? Is not a man, as to his essence, these two? The Lord, however, is Good itself and Truth itself, that is, Divine Good and Divine Truths, and these two also are the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 555</h4><p>555. Verse 11. And they overcame him through the blood of the Lamb, and through the word of their testimony, signifies victory by the Divine truth of the Word, and thence by the acknowledgment that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that the precepts of the Decalogue are precepts of life according to which one must live. That "the blood of the Lamb" is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, which is the Divine truth of the Word, may be seen above, (<a href="379.htm">379</a>[1-7]); at "the testimony" is the Divine truth, above, (<a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="16.htm">16</a>), and that it specifically consists in these two things, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that the commandments of the Decalogue are precepts of life, (<a href="490.htm">490</a>, <a href="506.htm">506</a>); for which reason, the Decalogue is also called "the testimony" (<a href="3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_31_7.htm">31:7</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_31_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_32_15.htm">32:15</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_16_13.htm">Leviticus 16:13</a>; <a href="3927/numbers_17_4.htm">Numbers 17:4</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_78_5.htm">Psalms 78:5</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_132_12.htm">132:12</a>). Those at the present day, that are in faith alone, believe that, by "the blood of the Lamb," is here meant the Lord's passion of the cross, and this because they make the Lord's passion of the cross the principal one of their dogmas, saying, that thereby He transferred to Himself the condemnation of the law, made satisfaction to the Father, and reconciled the human race to Him; besides many other things. That this, however, is not the case, but that the Lord came into the world to subdue the hells and glorify His Human, and that the passion of the cross was the last combat, by which He fully conquered the hells and fully glorified His Human, may be seen in <a href="../lord/12.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem respecting the Lord 12-14</a>. Hence it may be seen, that by "the blood of the Lamb" is not here meant the passion of the cross according to the modern dogma. That by "the blood of the Lamb" is meant the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, which is the Divine truth of the Word, may appear from this consideration, that the Lord is the Word; and because He is the Word, the Divine truth therein is His blood, and the Divine good therein, His body. This may be made manifest in this manner: Is not every man his own good and his own truth? And, since good is of the will, and truth of the understanding, every man is his own will and his own understanding. What else constitutes a man? Is not man, as to his essence, these two? But the Lord is good itself and truth itself, that is Divine good and Divine truth, which two are also the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 555 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>555. (Vers. 11.) "Et illi vicerunt eum per Sanguinem Agni, et per verbum testimonii illorum," significat victoriam per Divinum Verum Verbi, et inde per agnitionem quod Dominus sit Deus Caeli et Terrae, et quod praecepta Decalogi sint praecepta vitae secundum quae vivendum est. - Quod "Sanguis Agni" sit Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, quod est Divinum Verum Verbi, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_555/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_379" target=_top>379</a>); quod "testimonium" sit Divina veritas, supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_555/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6" target=_top>6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_555/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_16" target=_top>16</a>); et quod in specie sint haec duo, quod Dominus sit Deus Caeli et Terrae, et quod praecepta Decalogi sint praecepta vitae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_555/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490" target=_top>490</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_555/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_509" target=_top>509</a>); <sup>1</sup>quare etiam Decalogus vocatur "testimonium" <p>(<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_555/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_25_22" target=_top>Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_555/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_30_7" target=_top>30:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_555/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_30_18" target=_top>18</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_555/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_32_15" target=_top>32:15</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_555/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_16_13" target=_top>Leviticus 16:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_555/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_17_1-13" target=_top>Numeri 17</a>:19 (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_555/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_17_4" target=_top>4</a>); <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_555/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_78_5" target=_top>Psalm 78:5</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_555/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_132_12" target=_top>Psalm 132:12</a>).<p>Creditur ab hodiernis qui in sola Fide sunt, quod per "Sanguinem Agni hic intelligatur Passio crucis Domini, ex causa imprimis quia faciunt Passionem crucis Domini principale sui dogmatis, dicendo quod sic in Se transtulerit damnationem legis, satisfecerit Patri, ac Ipsi genus humanum reconciliaverit, praeter plura: at quod non ita sit, sed quod Dominus in Mundum venerit, ut subjugaret inferna et glorificaret Humanum, et quod Passio crucis fuerit ultima pugna per quam plene vicit inferna et plene glorificavit Humanum Suum, videatur Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_555/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_12" target=_top>12-14</a>). Inde videri potest quod per "Sanguinem Agni" hic non intelligatur Passio crucis secundum hodiernum dogma. Quod per "Sanguinem Agni" intelligatur Divinum Verum procedens ex Domino, quod est Divinum Verum Verbi, videri potest ex eo, quod Dominus sit Verbum; et quia est Verbum, quod Divinum Verum ibi sit Ipsius Sanguis, et Divinum Bonum ibi Ipsius Corpus. Hoc potest ad evidentiam doceri ita: Estne unusquisque homo suum bonum et suum verum; et quia bonum est voluntatis, et verum est intellectus, est unusquisque homo sua voluntas et suus intellectus; quid aliud facit hominem; estne homo quoad essentiam illa duo. Dominus autem est Ipsum Bonum et Ipsum Verum, hoc est Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum, quae duo etiam sunt Verbum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;509 pro "506" </p>
