<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 716</h4><p>716. To this I will append the following account:<p>I spoke with several English bishops in the spiritual world about the short works I published in London in 1758, namely, Heaven and Hell, The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine, The Last Judgment, The White Horse, and The Earths in the Universe. I had sent these short works as a gift to all the Bishops and to a number of magnates or lords. The bishops said that they had received them and looked them over, but that they did not regard them as having any merit, even though artfully written. And they said, too, that they had persuaded as many as they could not to read them.<p>I asked why this was, since in fact the books contain secrets concerning heaven and hell, and concerning life after death, and many more worthy of much merit, having been revealed by the Lord for people who will belong to His New Church, which is the New Jerusalem.<p>But they said, "What is that to us?" And they poured out invectives against them as they had in the world. I heard them.<p>I then read in their presence these verses from the Apocalypse:<p>Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, so that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be made ready. And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs. For they are spirits of demons that perform signs to go away to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty... And they gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew Armageddon. (<a href="3927/revelation_16_12.htm">Revelation 16:12-16</a>)<p>Having explained these verses in their presence, I told the bishops that they, and others like them elsewhere, were the people meant by these depictions.</p><p>[2] A king, the grandfather of the king reigning today, <sup>1</sup>heard from heaven what I said to the bishops, and being somewhat annoyed, he said, "What is this?"<p>And then one of those bishops, who had not gone along with the others in the world, turned to the king and said, "These whom you now see with your own eyes, thought in the world, and so even now continue to think, of the Lord's Divine humanity as being that of an ordinary person, and they attribute all salvation and redemption to God the Father, and not to the Lord except as the occasioning cause. For they believe in God the Father, and not in His Son, even though they know from the Lord that it is the Father's will that they believe in the Son, that those who believe in the Son shall have eternal life, and that those who do not believe in the Son shall not see life. <sup>2</sup><p>"In addition, the charity done by the Lord through a person as though done by the person - this they cast out from having anything to do with salvation."</p><p>[3] Speaking further with the king, the bishop disclosed the hierarchy that many of the bishops continually aspire to and also take part in, which they establish by joining together and forming an alliance. They do this with all of their order through emissaries, messengers, letters and conversations, supported by their ecclesiastical and at the same time political authority. As a result they almost all cling together, like a single bundle of sticks. Moreover, it is in consequence of that hierarchy, too, that even though the aforementioned works for the New Jerusalem were published in London and sent to them as a gift, they have caused those works to be so shamefully rejected that they are regarded as not even worth a mention in their book catalogue.<p>Hearing this, the king was dumbfounded, especially on being told that the bishops thought as they did regarding the Lord, who nevertheless is God of heaven and earth, and regarding charity, which nevertheless is the essence of religion.<p>At that, by a shaft of light descending then from heaven, the interiors of their minds and faith were laid open; and when the king saw them, he said, "Depart! Alas, who can become so hardened against hearing anything relating to heaven and eternal life?"</p><p>[4] The king then asked why the clergy rendered the bishops such universal obedience, and the bishop said that it resulted from the power granted to every bishop in his diocese of nominating to the king only one man or candidate for a parish, and not three as in other kingdoms. Owing to that power, then, they have the ability to promote their supporters to higher positions of honor and larger incomes - each one according to the obedience that he renders.<p>The bishop disclosed also how far that hierarchy could go, and that it has progressed to the point that power is the essential goal and religion a formality.<p>He revealed, too, their passion for power, and when viewed by angels, they saw that it exceeded the passion for power of people in positions of secular authority.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In 1766 when this work was published, the reigning monarch was George III, who in 1760 succeeded his grandfather, George II, as king of England.<br><br>2. <a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">3:36</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 716</h4><p>716. To these things I will add this MEMORABLE OCCURRENCE. In the spiritual world I spoke with some English bishops concerning the small works published at London in the year 1758, which were:<p>CONCERNING HEAVEN AND HELL<p>CONCERNING THE NEW JERUSALEM AND ITS HEAVENLY DOCTRINE<p>CONCERNING THE LAST JUDGMENT<p>CONCERNING THE WHITE HORSE and<p>CONCERNING THE EARTHS IN THE UNIVERSE.<p>These small works have been sent as a gift to all the bishops, and to many great men or lords. They said that they received them and looked at them, but that they did not consider them worthy of notice, although written skilfully; and also that they persuaded whomsoever they could not to read them. I asked them why, when yet there we have arcana concerning heaven and hell, and the life after death, and more things of great worth, which have been revealed by the Lord for those who will be of His New Church, which is the New Jerusalem. But they said, 'What do these things matter to us?'; and they poured out disparagements against them, just as formerly in the world. I heard them. And then in their presence these words were read out of the Apocalypse:<p>And the sixth angel poured out his phial upon the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, that the way of kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared. And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs. For they are the spirits of demons doing signs to go away to the kings of the land and of the whole world, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God Omnipotent. And he gathered them together into the place termed in Hebrew ARMAGEDDON. <a href="3927/revelation_16_12.htm">Revelation 16:12-16</a>.<p>These things were expounded in their presence, and it was said that they, and others like them, were those who are understood thereby.</p><p>[2] From heaven, the king <sup>1</sup>, the grandfather of the king at present reigning, heard these things that were said to the bishops, and being somewhat displeased said, 'What is this?' And then a certain one of them who had not agreed with them in the world, turned to the king and said, 'Those whom you now see with your eyes thought in the world, and consequently also think now, of the Lord's Divine Human as of the human of an ordinary man, and they attribute all salvation and redemption to God the Father, and not to the Lord except as a cause for the sake of which [this is effected]. For they believe in God the Father, and not in His Son, although they know from the Lord that it is the will of the Father that they should believe in the Son, and that they who believe in the Son may have eternal life; and that they who do not believe in the Son are not going to see life [<a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>; <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">3:36</a>]. Besides this they cast out the charity that is done by the Lord by means of a man as by him, from having anything to do with salvation.'</p><p>[3] Speaking further with the king he exposed the HIERARCHY, which many of them continually aim at and practise, which they strengthen by joining together and combining with all of their order by means of emissaries, messages, letters and speeches, supported by ecclesiastical and at the same time political authority, as the result of which they all stick together like one bunch (fascis). And [he said] that by means of that hierarchy it has also been brought about that the above-named WORKS FOR THE NEW JERUSALEM, although published at London and sent to them as a gift, have been so disgracefully rejected as not to be deemed worthy even of a place among the books to be named in their catalogue. On hearing these things the king was utterly amazed, especially at their thinking in that manner of the Lord, Who yet is the God of heaven and earth; and of charity, which yet is religion itself. And then by means of the light let in from heaven the interiors of their mind and faith were opened. And the king saw, and then said, 'Go away! Alas, who can become so apathetic at hearing anything about heaven and eternal life?</p><p>[4] Thereupon an inquiry was made by the king, whence they had such complete obedience from the clergy, and it was said that it is from the authority conceded to each bishop in his own diocese of nominating to the king only one candidate for [each of the] congregations, and not three as in other kingdoms. Also that by virtue of that authority they had the right to promote their proteges to higher honours and larger revenues, anyone they please according to the obedience he offers. It was also disclosed how far that hierarchy is able to go, and that it advances as far as making dominion the essential thing and religion a formality. Their ardour for dominating was also laid open and viewed by angels, and it was seen that it exceeds the ardour for dominating of those who have authority in secular matters.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;George II. Cf. <a href="344.htm">344</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 716</h4><p>716. To the above I will add this Relation. In the spiritual world I spoke with some English bishops concerning the small works published there at London in the year 1758, which were Concerning Heaven and Hell, Concerning the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, Concerning the Last Judgment, Concerning the White Horse and Concerning the Earths in the Universe; which small works were sent as a gift to all the bishops, and to many of the nobles or lords. They said that they received them, and saw them, but did not think them worthy, although skillfully written; and likewise that they persuaded as many as they could not to read them. I asked, "Why so, when yet there are there arcana concerning heaven and hell, and concerning the life after death, and more things most worthy of attention, which have been revealed by the Lord for those who will be of His New Church, which is the New Jerusalem?" But they said, "What is this to us?" and they poured out vituperations against them as formerly in the world. I heard them. And then these things were read before them from Revelation:<p>And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates, and the water of it was dried up, that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared; and I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet three unclean spirits like frogs; for they are spirits of demons doing signs to go away unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them together unto the battle of that great day of God Almighty; and He gathered them together unto the place called in Hebrew Armageddon, (<a href="3927/revelation_16_12.htm">Revelation 16:12-16</a>).<p>This was explained before them; and it was said that they, and similar persons elsewhere, were meant by these things.</p><p>[2] The king, grandfather <sup>1</sup>to the king now reigning, heard from heaven these things which were said to the bishops; and being somewhat indignant said, "What is this?" And then a certain one of them, who had not made one with them in the world, turned to the king, and said, "These, whom you now see with your eyes, thought in the world, and hence also think now, of the Lord's Divine Human as of the human of a common man, and attribute all salvation and redemption to God the Father, and not to the Lord, except as a cause for the sake of which they are. For they believe in God the Father, and not in His Son, although they know from the Lord, that it is the will of the Father, that they should believe in the Son; and that they who believe in the Son should have eternal life; and that they who do not believe in the Son, will not see life. Besides this, they cast out charity, which is done by the Lord through man as by him, from the smallest part in salvation."</p><p>[3] Speaking further with the king, he exposed the hierarchy which many of them continually affect and also exercise, which they strengthen by conjunction and combination with all of their order, by means of emissaries, internuncios, letters, and conversations, upheld by ecclesiastical and at the same time political authority; from which they almost all hold together like one bundle. And it is also effected by that hierarchy, that the above-named works for the New Jerusalem, though published at London, and sent to them as a gift, have been so shamefully rejected, that they have not even been held worthy to be named among the books of their catalogue. On hearing this the king was astonished, especially at their thinking so of the Lord, who yet is the God of heaven and earth, and of charity, which yet is religion itself. And then the interiors of their mind and faith were laid open by light let in from heaven; and the king saw, and then said, "Depart; alas, who can grow so callous against hearing anything concerning heaven and eternal life?"</p><p>[4] The king then inquired, whence so universal an obedience was paid to them by the clergy; and it was said that it was from the authority conceded to every bishop in his diocese, of nominating to the king only one candidate to the churches, and not three, as in other kingdoms. Also that from that power they had the influence to advance their dependents to higher honors and larger incomes, each one according to the obedience which he manifests. It was also disclosed how far that hierarchy might go, and that it might advance so far that dominion would be the essential, and religion formal. The ardor of these for dominion was also laid open, and viewed by the angels; and it was seen to exceed the ardor for dominion of those who are in secular authority.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This was published in the year 1766, consequently the king here mentioned is George II. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 716 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>716. His adjiciam hoc MEMORABILE:- <p>In mundo spirituali locutus sum cum quibusdam Episcopis Angliae, ibi de Opusculis editis Londini Anno 1758, quae erant De Caelo et Inferno, De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti De Ultimo Judicio, De Equo Albo, et De Telluribus in universo; quae Opuscula ad omnes Episcopos et ad plures Magnates seu Lords, dono missa sunt. <p>Dixerunt, quod receperint illa, viderint illa, at quod non reputaverint illa digna, tametsi scite scripta: et quoque quod persuaserint quibuscunque possent ne legerentur.

Praeter quod Charitatem, quae fit a Domino per hominem ut ab illo, a puncto Salvationis ejiciant." <p>Ulterius loquens cum Rege detexit Hierarchiam, quam plures ex illis continuo affectant et quoque exercent; quam constabiliunt per conjunctionem et colligationem, quae fit per emissarios, internuntios, epistolas et loquelas, ecclesiastica et simul politica auctoritate suffultas, cum omnibus sui Ordinis; ex quo cohaerent paene omnes sicut unus fascis; et quod per illam Hierarchium etiam effectum sit, quod supra nominata Opera pro Nova Hierosolyma, tametsi Londini edita, et ad illos dono missa, tam foede rejecta sint ut ne quidem digna habita sint inter Libros recensionis nominari. <p>His auditis Rex obstupuit, imprimis quod ita cogitaverint de Domino, Qui tamen est Deus Caeli et Terrae; ac de Charitate, quae tamen est ipsa Religio. <p>Et tunc per lucem e Caelo immissam aperta sunt interiora mentis et fidei illorum; et Rex vidit, et tunc dixit, "Abite; heu quis potest in tantum occalescere ad audiendum aliquid de Caelo, et de Vita aeterna." <p>Deinde a Rege inquisitum est, unde illis tam universalis obedientia a Clero; et dictum est, quod sit a concessa cuivis Episcopo in sua dioecesi potestate nominandi coram Rege modo unum ad Ecclesias, et non sicut in aliis Regnis, tres, etiam vocatos; et quod ex ea potestate illis sit auctoritas promovendi Clientes ad honores eminentiores et ad reditus largiores, quemlibet secundum obedientiam quam praestitit. Detectum etiam est quousque Hierarchia illa progredi possit, et quod progrediatur eousque ut Dominium sit essentiale, et Religio formale. Apertus etiam est horum ardor dominandi, et spectatus ab angelis; et visum quod excedat ardorem dominandi illorum qui in saeculari potestate sunt. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;qui pro "quae" </p>
