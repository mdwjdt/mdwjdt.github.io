<p>52.“从祂口中出来一把两刃的利剑”表主凭圣言和由此而来的教义驱散虚假。圣言经常提及“剑”、“刀”和“长剑”，它们无非是指与虚假争战并摧毁它们的真理；在相反的意义上，则指与真理争战的虚假。因为在圣言中，“战争”表属灵的战争，也就是真理攻击虚假和虚假攻击真理的战争；因此“战争武器”就表示诸如属灵战争中所使用的那类事物。显然，此处“剑”表示主驱散虚假，因为是所看到的这剑是“从祂口中出来”的。从主口中出来就是从圣言出来，因为圣言是主亲口说的。由于圣言需藉教义来理解，因此“剑”也表教义。它之所以被称为“两刃的利剑”，是因为它能刺透内心和灵魂。</p><p>为说明“剑”在此表示主藉圣言驱散虚假，特引用一些提及刀剑的经文：</p><p>有刀剑临到巴比伦，她的首领与智慧人；有刀剑临到矜夸的人，他们就成为愚昧；有刀剑临到勇士，他们就惊惶；有刀剑临到她的马匹、战车；有刀剑临到她的宝物，它们就被抢夺；有干旱临到她的众水，它们就必干涸。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.35.htm">50:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.38.htm">38</a>）</p><p>这些话是指着巴比伦说的，“巴比伦”表示那些歪曲并玷污圣言的人，因此成为愚昧的“矜夸的人”和刀剑所临到的马匹并战车，以及被抢夺的“宝物”，就表示其教义的虚假。干旱临到、它们就必干涸的“众水”表示真理（参看<a href="50.htm">50</a>节）。</p><p>你要预言说，一把磨利发亮的剑，磨利为要大行杀戮；要第三次使这剑；刺透的剑；大大刺透、刺入内部的剑，好叫跌倒的事加增。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结21.9.htm">21:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结21.20.htm">20</a>）</p><p>此处“剑”也表示教会中真理的荒废。</p><p>耶和华用剑向凡有血肉的行判罚，被耶和华刺死的必多。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.16.htm">66:16</a>）</p><p>在圣言中，无论此处还是别处，那些因虚假灭亡的人就被称为“被耶和华刺死的”。</p><p>灭命的都来到旷野中一切高岗上；耶和华的剑，从地这边直到地那边，尽行杀灭。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.12.htm">12:12</a>）</p><p>因为旷野的剑，我们冒着生命危险，才得粮食。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀5.9.htm">5:9</a>）</p><p>丢弃羊群的无用牧人有祸了；剑必临到他的膀臂和右眼上。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚11.17.htm">11:17</a>）</p><p>临到牧人右眼的“剑”是指他所理解的虚假。</p><p>世人性如烈火，他们的舌头是利剑。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗57.4.htm">57:4</a>）</p><p>看哪，他们口中喷吐恶言；嘴里有剑。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗59.7.htm">59:7</a>）</p><p>他们磨舌如剑，发出苦毒的言语。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗64.3.htm">64:3</a>）</p><p>其它地方的剑所表相同，如以赛亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.13.htm">13:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.14.htm">21:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛27.1.htm">27:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.7.htm">31:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.8.htm">8</a>），耶利米书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.30.htm">2:30</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.12.htm">5:12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶11.22.htm">11:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.13.htm">14:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.18.htm">18</a>），以西结书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结7.15.htm">7:15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.10.htm">32:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.12.htm">12</a>）。</p><p>由此明显可知，主在以下经文中所说的“剑”是什么意思：</p><p>耶稣说，祂来不是把和平，而是把剑带到地上。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.34.htm">10:34</a>）</p><p>耶稣说，没有钱囊和口袋的，卖衣服买剑。门徒说，主啊，请看！这里有两把剑。祂对他们说，够了。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.36.htm">22:36</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.38.htm">38</a>）</p><p>凡持剑的，必死在剑下。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.51.htm">26:51</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.52.htm">52</a>）</p><p>论到时代的末了，耶稣说：</p><p>他们要倒在剑刃之下，又被掳到众民族当中，最后耶路撒冷要被践踏。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.24.htm">21:24</a>）</p><p>“时代的末了”是指教会的末期；“剑”是指毁灭真理的虚假；“众民族”是指众邪恶；被践踏的“耶路撒冷”是指教会。</p><p>因此很明显，“从人子口中出来一把两刃的利剑”表示主藉圣言驱散。以下启示录经文所表相同：</p><p>又有一把大剑赐给那骑红马的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.4.htm">6:4</a>）</p><p>有利剑从骑白马者的口中出来，祂用这剑击杀列族。其余的被骑白马者的剑杀了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.15.htm">19:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.21.htm">21</a>）</p><p>“骑白马者”表示圣言方面的主，这在13和16节经文说得很清楚。诗篇中的“剑”所表相同：</p><p>大能者啊，愿你的大腿边佩剑。乘驾真理之道。你的箭锋利。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.3.htm">45:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p>这论及主。另有：</p><p>愿圣民高兴，愿他们口中的剑在手里。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗149.5.htm">149:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗149.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>以赛亚书：</p><p>耶和华使我口如利剑。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.2.htm">49:2</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 52</h4><p>52. And issuing from His mouth a sharp two-edged sword. This symbolizes a dispersion of falsities by the Lord by means of the Word and doctrine drawn from it.<p>Swords are often mentioned in the Word, and they symbolize nothing else than truth combating falsities and destroying them. In an opposite sense they also symbolize falsity combating truths. For wars in the Word symbolize spiritual wars, which are those of truth against falsity, and of falsity against truth. Therefore the weapons of war symbolize the means by which the combat is carried on in these wars.<p>It is apparent that the sword here means a dispersion of falsities by the Lord, because it was seen to issue from His mouth, and to issue from the Lord's mouth is to do so from the Word, for the Lord spoke it with His mouth. Furthermore, because the Word is understood by means of doctrine drawn from it, this too is symbolically meant.<p>It is called a sharp two-edged sword because it pierces the heart and soul.</p><p>[2] To show that the sword here means a dispersion of falsities by the Lord by means of the Word, we will cite some passages which mention a sword, from which the reality of this can be seen. Namely:<p>A sword against... Babylon, ...her princes and her wise men! A sword against the liars, that they may become fools! A sword against her mighty men, that they may be dismayed! A sword against her horses and her chariots...! A sword against her treasures, that they may be plundered! A drought upon her waters, that they may be dried up! (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_35.htm">Jeremiah 50:35-38</a>)<p>The subject here is Babylon, and by it are meant people who falsify and adulterate the Word. Consequently the liars who are to become fools, the horses and chariots with a sword upon them, and the treasures that will be plundered symbolize their doctrinal falsities. The waters that will have a drought upon them that they may be dried up symbolize truths, as may be seen just above in no. <a href="50.htm">50</a>.</p><p>[3] ...prophesy and say..., "A sword... is sharpened and also polished! Sharpened to make a great slaughter... Let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain, a sword for a great slaughter, piercing the innermost recesses, that... stumbling blocks may be multiplied." (<a href="3927/ezekiel_21_9.htm">Ezekiel 21:9-15</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_21_19.htm">19-20</a>)<p>A sword here means also the laying waste of truth in the church.<p>Jehovah will contend... with His sword against all flesh, and the slain by Jehovah shall be multiplied. (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a>)<p>Here and elsewhere in the Word, the slain by Jehovah are what people are called who perish as a result of falsities.<p>On all the desolate heights in the wilderness the plunderers have come, ...the sword of Jehovah devouring from one end of the land to the other. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_12_12.htm">Jeremiah 12:12</a>)<p>At the peril of our lives we bring in our bread, because of the sword in the wilderness. (<a href="3927/lamentations_5_9.htm">Lamentations 5:9</a>)<p>Woe to the worthless shepherd who deserts the flock! A sword shall be against his arm and against his right eye. (<a href="3927/zechariah_11_17.htm">Zechariah 11:17</a>)<p>The sword against the shepherd's right eye is falsity in his intellect.<p>...the sons of men are set on fire..., their tongue a sharp sword. (<a href="3927/psalms_57_4.htm">Psalms 57:4</a>)<p>Behold, they belch with their mouth; a sword is in their lips. (<a href="3927/psalms_59_7.htm">Psalms 59:7</a>)<p>(The workers of iniquity) sharpen their tongue like a sword... (<a href="3927/psalms_64_3.htm">Psalms 64:3</a>)<p>A sword has similar symbolic meanings elsewhere, as in <a href="3927/isaiah_13_15.htm">Isaiah 13:15</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_21_14.htm">21:14-15</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_37_6.htm">37:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_37_38.htm">38</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_31_7.htm">31:7-8</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_2_30.htm">Jeremiah 2:30</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_12.htm">5:12</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_11_22.htm">11:22</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_14_13.htm">14:13-18</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_7_15.htm">Ezekiel 7:15</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_32_10.htm">32:10-12</a>.</p><p>[4] It can be seen from this what the Lord meant by a sword in the following places:<p>(Jesus said that He did not come) to bring peace on the earth... but a sword. (<a href="3927/matthew_10_34.htm">Matthew 10:34</a>)<p>(Jesus said,) ."..he who does (not) have a purse... and... knapsack..., let him sell his garments and buy (a sword)...." (The disciples) said, "Lord, look, here are two swords." And He said..., "It is enough." (<a href="3927/luke_22_36.htm">Luke 22:36</a>, <a href="3927/luke_22_38.htm">38</a>)<p>...all who take the sword will perish by the sword. (<a href="3927/matthew_26_51.htm">Matthew 26:51-52</a>)<p>Regarding the end of the age, Jesus says,<p>They will fall by the edge of the sword, and be taken captive among all the nations. And (finally) Jerusalem will be trampled... (<a href="3927/luke_21_24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>)<p>The end of the age is the final period of the church. The sword is falsity destroying truth. The nations are evils. The Jerusalem which will be trampled is the church.</p><p>[5] It is apparent from this, now, that a sharp sword issuing from the mouth of the Son of Man symbolizes a dispersion of falsities by the Lord by means of the Word.<p>So, too, in the following places in the book of Revelation:<p>...to the one who sat on (the fiery red horse)...there was given... a great sword. (<a href="3927/revelation_6_4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a>)<p>From the mouth (of Him who sat on the white horse) came a sharp sword, that with it He might strike the nations... ...the rest were killed with the sword... of Him who sat on the horse. (<a href="3927/revelation_19_15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_21.htm">21</a>)<p>He who sat on the white horse means the Lord in relation to the Word, something that is openly stated there in verses <a href="3927/revelation_19_13.htm">13</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_19_16.htm">16</a>.<p>The like is meant in the book of Psalms:<p>Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O Mighty One... ride upon the word of truth... Your arrows are sharp... (<a href="3927/psalms_45_3.htm">Psalms 45:3-5</a>)<p>The subject is the Lord. Moreover, elsewhere:<p>Let the saints exult... and let a two-edged sword be in their hand. (<a href="3927/psalms_149_5.htm">Psalms 149:5-6</a>)<p>And in Isaiah:<p>(Jehovah) has made My mouth like a sharp sword. (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 52</h4><p>52. 'And out of His mouth a sharp two-edged sword (romphaea) going forth' signifies the dispersion by the Lord of untruths by means of the Word and doctrine. Mention is frequently made in the Word of 'sword' (gladius), short sword' (machoera), and 'long sword' (romphaea), and by them nothing else is signified but truth fighting against untruths and destroying them, and also in the opposite sense what is untrue fighting against truths; for by 'wars' in the Word spiritual wars are signified, and these are of what is true against what is untrue and of what is untrue against what is true, and therefore by 'weapons of war' such things are signified as are fought with in these wars. It is plain that the dispersion by the Lord of untruths is understood here by 'sword' (romphaea), because it was seen to go out of His mouth, and to go out of the Lord's mouth is to go out of the Word, for the Lord has spoken this with the mouth; and because the Word is understood by means of doctrine therefrom, this is signified also. It is said, 'a sharp two-edged sword' because it penetrates the heart and soul.</p><p>[2] So that it may be known that by 'sword' (romphaea) here the dispersion by the Lord of untruths by means of the Word is understood, some passages will be adduced where 'sword' (gladius) is mentioned, from which this can be seen viz:<p>O sword against Babel, her princes and wise men: O sword against the liars, that they may become foolish: O sword against the mighty, that they may be dismayed: O sword against her horses and chariots. O sword against her treasures, that they may be plundered. A drought upon her waters that they may be dried up. <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_35.htm">Jeremiah 50:35-38</a>.<p>These things [are said] of Babel, by which those who falsify and adulterate the Word are understood. Consequently by the 'liars' who will become foolish, 'the horses and chariots' upon which the sword [will fall], and the 'treasures' that will be plundered, are signified the untruths of their doctrine. That the waters 'upon which there is a drought that they may be dried up' signify truths maybe seen just above (<a href="50.htm">50</a>).</p><p>[3] Prophesy and say, The sword is sharpened, and also furbished, sharpened to slaughter a slaughtering; let the sword be repeated the third time, the sword of those who are pierced; the sword of a great piercing, piercing the innermost recesses, that stumbling blocks may be multiplied. <a href="3927/ezekiel_21_14.htm">Ezekiel 21:14-20</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_21_28.htm">28</a>.<p>By 'sword' here also is understood the laying waste of truth in the Church.<p>Jehovah will deliver judgment with His sword upon all flesh, and the pierced of Jehovah shall be multiplied. <a href="3927/isaiah_66_16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a>.<p>Here and elsewhere in the Word, they are said to be 'pierced of Jehovah' who perish through untruths.<p>The spoilers have come upon all the hills in the wilderness; the sword of Jehovah devouring from one end of the land even to the other. <a href="3927/jeremiah_12_12.htm">Jeremiah 12:12</a>.<p>We get our bread with the peril of our souls because of the sword of the wilderness, <a href="3927/lamentations_5_9.htm">Lamentations 5:9</a>.<p>Woe to the worthless shepherd who leaves the flock; the sword [shall be] upon his arm, and upon his right eye, <a href="3927/zechariah_11_17.htm">Zechariah 11:17</a>.<p>The sword upon the shepherd's right eye is the untruth of his understanding.<p>The sons of men are set on fire, their tongue is a sharp sword. <a href="3927/psalms_57_4.htm">Psalms 57:4</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_57_5.htm">5</a>].<p>Behold, they belch out with their mouth, a sword in their lips. <a href="3927/psalms_59_7.htm">Psalms 59:7</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_59_8.htm">8</a>].<p>The workers of iniquity whet their tongue like a sword. <a href="3927/psalms_64_3.htm">Psalms 64:3</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_64_4.htm">4</a>].<p>Like things are signified by 'sword' elsewhere, as <a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_21_14.htm">21:14-15</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_27_1.htm">27:1</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_31_7.htm">31:7-8</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_2_30.htm">Jeremiah 2:30</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_12.htm">5:12</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_11_22.htm">11:22</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_14_13.htm">14:13-18</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_7_15.htm">Ezekiel 7:15</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_32_10.htm">32:10-12</a>.</p><p>[4] It can be established from these what was understood by the Lord by means of 'sword' in these places:<p>Jesus said, He had not come to send peace upon the land, but a sword. <a href="3927/matthew_10_34.htm">Matthew 10:34</a>.<p>Jesus said, He who does not have a purse and scrip, let him sell his garments, and buy a sword. The disciples said, Lord, Behold two swords, and He said, It is enough. <a href="3927/luke_22_36.htm">Luke 22:36</a>, <a href="3927/luke_22_38.htm">38</a>.<p>All they who take the sword, shall perish by the sword. <a href="3927/matthew_26_51.htm">Matthew 26:51-52</a>.<p>Jesus says concerning the consummation of the age:<p>They shall fall by the mouth of the sword, and they shall be led away captive among all nations, and at length Jerusalem shall be trodden down. <a href="3927/luke_21_24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>.<p>'The consummation of the age' is the last time of the Church; the 'sword' is what is untrue destroying what is true; the 'nations' are evils; the 'Jerusalem' that shall be trodden down is the Church.</p><p>[5] From these things it is now plain that by 'a sharp sword (machaera) going forth out of the mouth of the Son of Man' is signified the dispersion of untruths by the Lord by means of the Word. In like manner in the following passages in the Apocalypse:<p>A great sword (machaera) was given to the one sitting upon the red horse. <a href="3927/revelation_6_4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a>.<p>Out of the mouth of the One sitting upon the white horse there went out a sharp sword (romphaea), that with it He should smite the nations. The remnant were slain with the sword of Him sitting upon the horse. <a href="3927/revelation_19_15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_21.htm">21</a>.<p>By 'the One sitting upon the white horse' the Lord is understood as to the Word, and this is openly stated there (verse 13, 16). The like is understood in David:<p>Gird thy sword (gladius) upon Thy thigh, O Mighty One. Ride upon the Word of the truth (veritas). Thine arrows are sharp. <a href="3927/psalms_45_3.htm">Psalms 45:3-5</a> (H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_45_4.htm">4-6</a>].<p>These things [are said] concerning the Lord; and elsewhere:<p>The saints shall exult, and the sword (gladius) of mouths in their hand. <a href="3927/psalms_149_5.htm">Psalms 149:5-6</a>.<p>And in Isaiah:<p>Jehovah has made my mouth a sharp sword (gladius). <a href="3927/isaiah_49_2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 52</h4><p>52. And out of his mouth a sharp two-edged sword going forth, signifies the dispersion of falsities by the Word, and by doctrine thence from the Lord. Mention is very often made in the Word of "sword," "saber," and "long sword," and by them nothing else is signified but truth fighting against falsities and destroying them; and, also, in the opposite sense, the falsity fighting against truths; for by "wars" in the Word, are signified spiritual wars, which are wars of truth against falsity, and of falsity against truth; wherefore, by "the arms of war," such things are signified as are made use of in spiritual wars. That the dispersion of falsities by the Lord is here meant by sword [romphoea] is evident, because, it was seen "to go out of his mouth;" and to go out of the mouth of the Lord, is to go out of the Word, for this the Lord spoke with His mouth; and as the Word is understood by doctrine, thence this is also signified. It is called "a sharp two-edged sword," because it penetrates the heart and soul.</p><p>[2] To show that by "sword" is here meant the dispersion of falsities by the Word from the Lord, some passages shall be adduced in which sword [gladius] is mentioned:<p>A sword against Babylon, her princes, and her wise ones; O sword against the liars that they may become foolish; O sword against the mighty, that they may be dismayed; O sword against her horses, and her chariots; O sword against her treasures, that they may be despoiled. A drought is upon her waters, that they may be dried up, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_35.htm">Jeremiah 50:35-38</a>).<p>These things are said of Babylon, by which those are meant who falsify and adulterate the Word, therefore by the "liars" who will become foolish, and the "horses and chariots" upon whom there is a sword, and the "treasures" which will be despoiled, are signified the falsities of their doctrine. That the "waters" upon which is a drought that they may be dried up, signify truths, may be seen above, (<a href="50.htm">50</a>).</p><p>[3] Prophesy, and say, A sword is sharpened, and also furbished, sharpened to make a great slaughter; and let the sword be repeated the third time; the sword of the pierced; the sword of a great piercing, penetrating the inner parts, that stumbling blocks may be multiplied, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_21_9.htm">Ezekiel 21:9-20</a>).<p>By "sword" is here also meant the devastation of truth in the church.<p>Jehovah will plead by His sword with all flesh, and the pierced of Jehovah shall be multiplied, (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a>).<p>They are called "the pierced of Jehovah" here, and in other parts of the Word, who perish by falsities.<p>The wasters are come upon all the hills in the wilderness; the sword of Jehovah is devouring from the end of the earth, even to the end of the earth, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_12_12.htm">Jeremiah 12:12</a>).<p>We get our bread with the peril of our lives, because of the sword of the wilderness, (<a href="3927/lamentations_5_9.htm">Lamentations 5:9</a>).<p>Woe to the worthless shepherd that deserteth the flock; the sword shall be upon his arm and upon his right eye, (<a href="3927/zechariah_11_17.htm">Zechariah 11:17</a>).<p>The sword upon the right eye of the shepherd is the falsity of his understanding.<p>The sons of men are inflamed, their tongue is a sharp sword, (<a href="3927/psalms_57_4.htm">Psalms 57:4</a>).<p>Behold they belch out with their mouth; a sword is in their lips, (<a href="3927/psalms_59_7.htm">Psalms 59:7</a>).<p>The workers of iniquity whet their tongue like a sword, (<a href="3927/psalms_64_3.htm">Psalms 64:3</a>).<p>The same is signified by sword in other places, as in <a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_21_14.htm">21:14-15</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_27_1.htm">27:1</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_31_7.htm">31:7-8</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_2_30.htm">Jeremiah 2:30</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_12.htm">5:12</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_11_22.htm">11:22</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_14_13.htm">14:13-18</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_7_15.htm">Ezekiel 7:15</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_32_10.htm">32:10-12</a>.</p><p>[4] Hence it may appear what the Lord meant by "sword" in the following passages:<p>Jesus said, He came not to send peace on earth, but a sword, (<a href="3927/matthew_10_34.htm">Matthew 10:34</a>).<p>Jesus said, He that hath not a purse and a scrip, let him sell his garments and buy a sword. The disciples said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And He said unto them, It is enough, (<a href="3927/luke_22_36.htm">Luke 22:36</a>, <a href="3927/luke_22_38.htm">38</a>).<p>All they that take the sword, shall perish with the sword, (<a href="3927/matthew_26_51.htm">Matthew 26:51-52</a>).<p>Jesus says, concerning the consummation of the age:<p>They shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations, and at length Jerusalem shall be trodden down, (<a href="3927/luke_21_24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>).<p>"The consummation of the age" is the last time of the church; "the sword" is falsity destroying truth; the "nations" are evils; "Jerusalem" which shall be trodden down, is the church.</p><p>[5] Hence, then, it is evident, that by "a sharp sword going out of the mouth of the Son of man," is signified the dispersion of falsities by the Lord by means of the Word. The same is signified in the following passages in Revelation:<p>And there was given unto him who sat upon the red horse a great sword, (<a href="3927/revelation_6_4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a>).<p>And out of the mouth of Him who sat upon the white horse goeth a sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations. And the remnant were slain with the sword of Him that sat upon the horse, (<a href="3927/revelation_19_15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_21.htm">21</a>).<p>By "Him who sat upon the white horse," the Lord as to the Word, is meant, which is plainly declared (verses <a href="3927/revelation_19_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_16.htm">16</a>). The same is meant in David:<p>Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O Mighty One. Ride upon the word of truth. Thine arrows are sharp, (<a href="3927/psalms_45_3.htm">Psalms 45:3-5</a>);<p>speaking of the Lord. And in another place:<p>The saints shall exult, and the sword of their mouths is in their hand, (<a href="3927/psalms_149_5.htm">Psalms 149:5-6</a>).<p>And in Isaiah:<p>Jehovah hath made my mouth a sharp sword, (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 52 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>52. "Et ex ore Ipsius romphaea anceps acuta exiens," significat dispersionem falsorum per Verbum et per doctrinam inde a Domino. - In Verbo saepius dicitur "gladius," "machaera," et "romphaea," et per illa non aliud significatur quam verum pugnans contra falsa et destruens illa, et quoque in opposito sensu falsum pugnans contra vera: per "bella" enim in Verbo significantur bella spiritualia, quae sunt veri contra falsum, ac falsi contra verum; quare per "arma belli" significantur talia, per quae in his bellis pugnatur. Quod dispersio falsorum a Domino per "romphaeam" intelligatur, patet, quia visa est "exire ex ore Ipsius," exire ex ore Domini est ex Verbo, hoc enim ore locutus Dominus: et quia Verbum per Doctrinam inde intelligatur, etiam haec significatur: dicitur "romphaea anceps acuta," quia penetrat cor et animam. Ut sciatur, quod per romphaeam" hic intelligatur dispersio falsorum per Verbum a Domino, adducentur aliqua loca, ubi Gladius nominatur ex quibus hoc videri potest; quae sunt, <p>"Gladie contra Babelem, principes et sapientes ejus: Gladie contra mendaces ut stultescant: Gladie contra fortes ut consternentur: Gladie contra equos ejus et currus ejus: Gladie contra thesauros ejus ut diripiantur;
