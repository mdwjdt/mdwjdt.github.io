<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第455节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>455.“因它们的尾巴像蛇，并且有头用以害人”表推理，因为他们感官化，颠倒了，只是口头上谈论真理，但却通过构成其宗教信仰之头的原则而歪曲它们，因而他们是骗人的。蝗虫在此和前面所表相同（<a href="438.htm">438</a>，<a href="439.htm">439</a>节）；但在那里经上说，“它们有尾巴像蝎子”，而此处经上却说“像蛇”，因为“蝗虫”所描述的那些人通过圣言、知识和学问来谈论和说服；而此处这些人只是通过论据，也就是真理与谬论表象来谈论和说服；他们巧妙利用这类论据，仿佛很有智慧，其实都是骗人的，只是没有那么大的程度。</p><p>在圣言中，“蛇”表示感官事物，也就是人生命的最末端或最表层，如前所述（<a href="424.htm">424</a>节）；原因在于，所有动物都表示人的情感；因此，在灵界，从远处看，天使和灵人的情感显为各种动物；纯感官的情感看上去就像“蛇”，这是因为蛇紧贴地面爬行，并舔食尘土，感官事物是认知或理解力和意愿的最低级之物，最贴近这个世界，并以其物体和快乐为滋养，而这些物体和快乐只影响肉体的物质感官。各种各样的毒蛇表示依赖邪恶情感的感官事物，而邪恶情感构成那些因邪恶的虚假而疯狂之人的心智内层；没有毒的蛇则表示依赖良善情感的感官事物，而良善情感构成那些因良善的真理而有智慧之人的心智内层。</p><p>在以下经文中，“蛇”表示依赖邪恶情感的感官事物：</p><p>他们舔土像蛇。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.17.htm">7:17</a>）</p><p>尘土必作蛇的食物。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.25.htm">65:25</a>）</p><p>耶和华对蛇说，你必用肚子行走，尽你一生的日子吃土。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.14.htm">3:14</a>）</p><p>经上如此描述感官层，是因为它与地狱相通，地狱里的所有人都是感官的，在属灵的事上，将天堂的智慧转变为地狱的疯狂。</p><p>非利士啊，不要喜乐，因为从蛇的根必生出毒蛇，它的果子是火焰的飞蛇。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.29.htm">14:29</a>）</p><p>他们抱毒蛇蛋，吃这蛋的人必死，有人踏破这蛋，必有腹蛇孵出。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.5.htm">59:5</a>）</p><p>因为以色列人渴望回埃及，所以他们被蛇咬。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.4.htm">21:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>“回埃及”表示从成为属灵的变得感官化；正因如此，经上说：</p><p>埃及的雇勇转身逃跑，其中的声音好像蛇行一样。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.21.htm">46:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.22.htm">22</a>）</p><p>由于但是众支派中最远的，因而表示教会的最末端，就是服从于内层的感官主体，所以经上论到他时如此说：</p><p>但必作道上的蛇，咬伤马蹄，使骑马的向后坠落。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.17.htm">49:17</a>）</p><p>“马蹄”表示认知或理解力的最末端，也就是感官层；“咬”表示附着于它们；“骑马的”表示由这些败坏真理的感官事物所产生的无知；因此，经上说“骑马的向后坠落”。由于感官人像狐狸一样狡猾奸诈，故主说：</p><p>你们要灵巧像蛇。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.16.htm">10:16</a>）</p><p>因为感官人通过表象和谬论进行谈论和推理；他若具有辩论的才能，就知道如何巧妙地确认每一个虚假，包括唯信这一异端邪说，而在明白真理的能力上却如此愚钝，以至于几乎不可能更愚钝了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 455</h4><p>455. [And in their tails,] for their tails were like serpents, having heads, and with them they do harm. This symbolizes the reason, namely, that they are sensual and turned upside down, speaking truths with their mouths, but falsifying them by the premise which forms the chief tenet of their religion, and thus deceiving others.<p>The symbolism here is similar to that earlier in the case of the locusts (nos. <a href="438.htm">438</a>, <a href="439.htm">439</a>), but there we were told that they had tails like scorpions, and here tails like serpents. For the people described by locusts there speak and persuade using the Word, scholarship and learning, whereas the people described here employ arguments that consist only of appearances of truth and fallacies; and people who use these to speak harmoniously and seemingly wisely do indeed deceive others, but not to the same extent.</p><p>[2] Serpents in the Word symbolize sensual elements, which are the lowest constituents of a person's life, as described in no. <a href="424.htm">424</a> above. The reason is that all animals symbolize human affections. Consequently, in the spiritual world the affections of angels and spirits also look at a distance like animals, and merely sensual affections like serpents. That is because serpents slither along the ground and lick the dust, and sensual matters are the lowest in the intellect and in the will, being most closely connected with the world and being fed by its objects and delights, which affect only the physical senses of the body.<p>Harmful serpents, of which there are many kinds, symbolize sensual matters dependent on the evil affections that form the interior motivations of the mind in people who, owing to the falsities accompanying evil, are irrational. And harmless serpents symbolize sensual matters dependent on the good affections that form the interior motivations of the mind in people who, owing to the truths accompanying goodness, are wise.</p><p>[3] Sensual matters dependent on evil affections are symbolized by serpents in the following passages:<p>They shall lick the dust like a serpent. (<a href="3927/micah_7_17.htm">Micah 7:17</a>)<p>Dust shall be the serpent's food. (<a href="3927/isaiah_65_25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>)<p>(The serpent was told:) On your belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life. (<a href="3927/genesis_3_14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>)<p>The sensual level in a person is thus described, and because it communicates with hell, where the people are all sensual, it turns heavenly wisdom in spiritual matters into hellish insanity.<p>Do not rejoice, Philistia...; for out of the serpent's roots will come forth a viper, whose offspring will be a fiery flying serpent. (<a href="3927/isaiah_14_29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>)<p>They hatch a viper's eggs...; he who eats of its eggs dies, and when anyone squeezes them, a viper breaks out. (<a href="3927/isaiah_59_5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>)<p>Because the children of Israel wished to return to Egypt, they were bitten by serpents (<a href="3927/numbers_21_4.htm">Numbers 21:4-9</a>). To return to Egypt means, symbolically, to go from being spiritual to being sensual. So we read,<p>(The) mercenaries (of Egypt)...are turned back... Its sound shall go like that of a serpent... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_46_21.htm">Jeremiah 46:21-22</a>)</p><p>[4] Because Dan was the furthest out of the tribes and so symbolized the outmost component of the church, which is the sensual one subject to its interior ones, therefore this is said of it:<p>Dan shall be a serpent by the way... that will bite the horse's heels so that its rider falls backward. (<a href="3927/genesis_49_17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a>)<p>A horse's heels symbolize the lowest constituents of the intellect, which are its sensual ones. To bite means, symbolically, to cling to them. The rider symbolizes the ignorance produced by them, by which it perverts truths. We are told, therefore, that the rider will fall backward.<p>Since sensual people are cunning and crafty like foxes, therefore the Lord says, "Be as wise as serpents" (<a href="3927/matthew_10_16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>). For a sensual person speaks and reasons on the basis of appearances and fallacies, and if he possesses a talent for arguing, he knows how to skillfully defend every falsity, including as well the heresy of faith alone; and yet he is so dim-sighted at seeing truth that almost no one could be more so. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 455</h4><p>455. 'For their tails were like serpents having heads, and with these (in his) they do hurt' signifies the reason, that they are sensual and inverted, speaking true things by the mouth, [but] rendering them false because of the principle that makes the head of the doctrine of their religion, and thus they deceive. Here are signified things similar to those spoken of before (<a href="438.htm">438-439</a>), but there it is said that they had 'tails like scorpions,' whereas here [they are said to be] like serpents, because those who are described by the locusts speak and persuade from the Word and from things of knowledge and learning; but they do this only by arguments that are appearances of truth and fallacies, and those who speak from these things elegantly and as if wisely do indeed deceive, but not to so great an extent.</p><p>[2] By 'serpents' in the Word are signified the sensual things that are the ultimates of a man's life, of which above (<a href="424.htm">424</a>). This is because all animals signify a man's affections, and therefore also the affections of angels and spirits in the spiritual world appear afar off as animals, and affections purely sensual as 'serpents.' The reason is that serpents creep upon the ground and lick the dust, while sensual things are the lowest of understanding and will, for they stand nearest to the world and are nourished by the objects and delights thereof, and these affect only the material senses of the body. Harmful serpents, which are of many kinds, signify the sensual things that depend upon the affections of evil that make the interiors of the mind with those who are insane by reason of untruths of evil, while harmless serpents signify the sensual things that depend on the good affections that make the interiors of the mind with those who are wise by reason of truths of good.</p><p>[3] Sensual things depending on affections of evil are signified by 'serpents' in these passages:<p>They shall lick the dust like a serpent. <a href="3927/micah_7_17.htm">Micah 7:17</a>.<p>Dust [shall be] the serpent's bread. <a href="3927/isaiah_65_25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>.<p>It was said to the serpent, Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. <a href="3927/genesis_3_14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>.<p>Thus is described the sensual, which, because it communicates with hell where all are sensual, turns heavenly wisdom into infernal insanity in spiritual things.<p>Rejoice not, Philistia, for out of the serpent's root shall go forth the basihisk, whose fruit is a flying fiery serpent. <a href="3927/isaiah_14_29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>.<p>They lay asp's eggs; he who eats of its eggs dies, and when one presses it out, a viper is hatched. <a href="3927/isaiah_59_5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>.<p>Because the sons of Israel desired to go back into Egypt they were bitten by serpents (<a href="3927/numbers_21_4.htm">Numbers 21:4-9</a>). To 'go back into Egypt' signified to become sensual from being spiritual; and therefore it is said:<p>The hired men of Egypt have turned themselves away, the voice thereof shall go like a serpent. <a href="3927/jeremiah_46_21.htm">Jeremiah 46:21</a> [, <a href="3927/jeremiah_46_22.htm">22</a>].</p><p>[4] Because Dan was the most remote (ultima) of the tribes, and consequently signified the ultimate of the Church, which is the sensual subject to the interiors, it is therefore said thus of him:<p>Dan is a serpent upon the way biting the horse's heels, and the rider thereof shall fall backwards. <a href="3927/genesis_49_17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a>.<p>By 'the horse's heels' are signified the ultimates of the understanding, which are sensual; by 'to bite' is signified to adhere to them; by 'the rider' is signified the ignorance resulting from these [sensual things] by which it perverts truths, and therefore it is said 'the rider thereof shall fall backwards.' Since sensual men are crafty and cunning like foxes, therefore the Lord said:<p>Be prudent as serpents. <a href="3927/matthew_10_16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>.<p>For the sensual man speaks and reasons from appearances and fallacies, and if he is skilled in the gift of arguing he knows exactly how to confirm every untruth, and also the heresy of faith alone, and still is so dull in the power of seeing what is true that scarcely any one else could be duller. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 455</h4><p>455. For their tails were like unto serpents having heads, and with them they hurt, signifies the reason, because they are sensual and inverted, speaking truths with their lips, but falsifying them by the principle which constitutes the head of the doctrine of their religion, and thus they deceive. The like is here signified as above by the locusts, (<a href="438.htm">438-439</a>); but it is there said, that they had "tails like scorpions," whereas here, like "serpents," for they who are described by the locusts, speak and persuade from the Word, the sciences, and from erudition; but these only from arguments which are appearances of truth and fallacies; and they who use such arguments ingeniously, and as it were wisely, do indeed deceive, but not in so great a degree.</p><p>[2] By "serpent" in the Word, are signified sensual things, which are the ultimates of man's life, as above, (<a href="424.htm">424</a>); the reason is, because all animals signify the affections of man, wherefore also the affections of angels and spirits, in the spiritual world, appear at a distance as animals, and affections merely sensual, as "serpents;" and this because serpents creep on the ground and lick the dust, and sensual things are the lowest of the understanding and will, being in close contact with the world, and nourished by its objects and delights, which only affect the material senses of the body. Noxious serpents, which are of many kinds, signify the sensual things that depend on the evil affections which constitute the interiors of the mind with those who are insane from the falsities of evil; and harmless serpents signify the sensual things that are dependent on the good affections, which constitute the interiors of the mind with those who are wise from the truths of good.</p><p>[3] Sensual things dependent an evil affections, are signified by serpents in these passages:<p>They lick the dust like a serpent, (<a href="3927/micah_7_17.htm">Micah 7:17</a>).<p>Dust shall be the serpent's bread, (<a href="3927/isaiah_65_25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>).<p>He said to the serpent, Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life, (<a href="3927/genesis_3_14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>).<p>The sensual is thus described, which, because it communicates with hell, where all are sensual, turns heavenly wisdom into infernal insanity in spiritual things.<p>Be not glad, Philistia, for out of the serpent's root shall go forth a basilisk, whose fruit is a flying fiery serpent, (<a href="3927/isaiah_14_29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>).<p>They lay asp's eggs; he that eateth of its eggs dieth, and when one presses it out, a viper is hatched, (<a href="3927/isaiah_59_5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>).<p>Because the sons of Israel desired to return into Egypt, they were bitten by serpents, (<a href="3927/numbers_21_4.htm">Numbers 21:4-9</a>).<p>"To return into Egypt," signified to become sensual from being spiritual; on which account it is said:<p>The hirelings of Egypt have turned themselves away, the voice thereof shall go like a serpent, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_46_21.htm">Jeremiah 46:21-22</a>).</p><p>[4] Because Dan was the farthest of the tribes, and thence signified the ultimate of the church, which is the sensual subject to the interiors, it is therefore said thus of him:<p>Dan is a serpent upon the way biting the horse's heels, and the rider shall fall backwards, (<a href="3927/genesis_49_17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a>).<p>By "the horse's heels" the ultimates of the understanding, which are sensual, are signified: by "biting" is signified to adhere to them: by "the rider" is signified the lack of knowledge from them, by which truths are perverted; for which reason it is said, "His rider shall fall backwards." Since sensual men are crafty and cunning like foxes, the Lord therefore says:<p>Be ye prudent as serpents, (<a href="3927/matthew_10_16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>).<p>For the sensual man speaks and reasons from appearances and fallacies; and if he is skilled in the gift of arguing, he knows how to confirm every falsity skillfully, and also the heresy concerning faith alone, and still is so dull in the power of seeing truth that it is scarcely possible to be duller. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 455 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>455. "Nam caudae illorum similes serpentibus habentes capita, et in his laedunt," significat causam, quod sensuales sint ac inversi, loquentes ore vera, falsificantes illa ex principio quod facit caput doctrinae religionis illorum, et sic fallunt. - Similia hic significantur, quae prius de "locustis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_455/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_438" target=_top>438</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_455/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_439" target=_top>439</a>); sed ibi dicitur quod haberent "caudas similes scorpiis," hic autem similes "serpentibus," quia illi qui per "locustas" describuntur, ex Verbo, ex scientiis et eruditione loquuntur et persuadent, hi autem solum ex argumentis, quae sunt apparentiae veri et fallaciae; et qui ex illis concinne et sicut sapienter loquuntur, fallunt quidem, sed non in tantum. Per "serpentes" in Verbo significantur sensualia, quae sunt ultima vitae hominis, de quibus supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_455/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_424" target=_top>424</a>); causa est, quia omnia animalia significant affectiones hominis: quare etiam affectiones angelorum et spirituum in mundo spirituali apparent e longinquo sicut animalia, et affectiones mere sensuales sicut serpentes; causa est, quia serpentes humi repunt, et pulverem lambunt; ac sensualia sunt infima intellectus et voluntatis, exstant enim mundo proxime, et ex ejus objectis et jucundis, quae solum sensus corporis materiales afficiunt, nutriuntur. Serpentes noxii, qui plurium generum sunt, significant sensualia quae pendent ab affectionibus malis quae faciunt interiora mentis apud illos qui ex falsis mali insaniunt; ac serpentes innoxii significant sensualia quae pendent ab affectionibus bonis quae faciunt interiora mentis apud illos qui ex veris boni sapiunt. Sensualia pendentia ex affectionibus malis significantur per "serpentes" in his locis: <p>"Lambent pulverem sicut Serpens," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_455/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_micah_7_17" target=_top>Micham 7:17</a>);<p>"Serpentis panis pulvis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_455/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_65_25" target=_top>Esaias 65:25</a>);<p>Dictum Serpenti, "Super ventre tuo ambulabis, et pulverem comedes omnibus diebus vitae tuae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_455/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_3_14" target=_top>Genesis 3:14</a>);<p>describitur sic sensuale, quod, quia communicat cum Inferno, ubi omnes sensuales sunt, vertit sapientiam caelestem in insaniam infernalem in rebus spiritualibus. <p>"Ne laeteris Philisthaea, nam e radice Serpentis exibit basiliscus, cujus fructus Prester volans," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_455/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_14_29" target=_top>Esaias 14:29</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>"Ova Aspidis ponunt: qui comedit de ovis ejus moritur, et quando quis exprimit, excluditur Vipera," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_455/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_59_5" target=_top>Esaias 59:5</a>);<p>Quia filii Israelis cupiverunt redire in Aegyptum, morsi sunt a Serpentibus, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_455/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_21_4-9" target=_top>Numeri 21:4-9</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>"redire in Aegyptum" significabat a spirituali fieri sensualis; quare dicitur, <p>"Mercenarii Aegypti averterunt se: vox ejus sicut Serpentes ibit," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_455/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_46_21" target=_top>Jeremias 46:21</a>(, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_455/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_46_22" target=_top>22</a>)).<p>Quia Dan erat ultima tribuum, et inde significabat ultimum Ecclesiae, quod est sensuale subjectum interioribus, ideo de illo ita dicitur: <p>"Dan Serpens super via mordens calcaneos equi, et cadet eques ejus retrorsum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_455/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_49_17" target=_top>Genesis 49:17</a>);<p>per "calcaneos equi" significantur ultima intellectus, quae sunt sensualia; per "mordere" significatur eis adhaerere; per "equitem" significatur inscitia ex illis, qua pervertit vera; quare dicitur, "cadet eques ejus retrorsum." Quoniam sensuales homines sunt callidi ac astuti sicut vulpes, ideo dicit Dominus, <p>"Estote prudentes sicut Serpentes," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_455/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_10_16" target=_top>Matthaeus 10:16</a>);<p>sensualis enim homo loquitur et ratiocinatur ex apparentiis et fallaciis; et si dote argumentandi pollet, solerter scit confirmare omne falsum, et quoque haereticum de sola fide; et usque est hebes acie videndi verum, ut vix alius hebetior.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;14:29 pro "15:9"<p>2.&nbsp;4-9 pro "1-10" </p>
