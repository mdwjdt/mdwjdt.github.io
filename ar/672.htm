<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>672.启15:7.“四活物中有一个把七个金香瓶给了那七位天使”表揭露教会的邪恶与虚假所凭借的那些真理与良善取自圣言的字义。“四活物”，也就是基路伯，表示终端的圣言，以及守卫，免得圣言的纯正真理与良善遭到侵犯（参看<a href="239.htm">239</a>节）；由于圣言的内在真理与良善由字义来守卫，故“四活物中的一个”表示圣言的字义。“七碗”和“七灾”所表相同，因为它们是盛东西的；在圣言中，盛东西的和所盛的东西所表相同；如“杯”和“酒”所表相同，“盘”和“食物”所表相同。“杯”、“酒杯”、“香瓶”（vials）、“盘”与它们所盛之物表示相同的事物，接下来就会看到这一点。前面已经说明“七位天使”表示什么。之所以“把香瓶给他们”，是因为所论述的主题是真理与良善进入教会的流注，好揭露教会的邪恶与虚假；裸露的良善与真理无法流入，因为这些不被接受；但诸如在圣言字义中那样被包裹的真理被接受。此处，主总是从最内层通过终端来作工，或总是作完全的工。这就是为何“七个香瓶给了那七位天使”的原因，以此表示含有诸如属于圣言字义的那类真理与良善，虚假与邪恶凭它们被查明。圣言的字义就是一个容器，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/27.htm">27</a>-36，<a href="../ss/37.htm">37</a>-49节）。</p><p>“香瓶”、“盘”、“杯”、“酒杯”、“瓶子”表示它们所盛之物，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>耶和华说，你从我手中接这杯烈怒的酒，使众民族喝；他们若不肯接这杯，你就说，你们一定要喝。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.15.htm">25:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.28.htm">28</a>）</p><p>巴比伦素来是耶和华手中的金杯，使全地沉醉。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.7.htm">51:7</a>）</p><p>我必将你姐姐的杯交在你手中；你必酩酊大醉，满有愁苦，喝干你姐姐撒玛利亚的杯，就是凄凉的杯。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.31.htm">23:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.34.htm">34</a>）</p><p>耶和华的杯必传到你那里，好叫你的荣耀上有呕吐物。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.16.htm">2:16</a>）</p><p>以东的女子哪，这杯也必传到你那里；你必喝醉，以致露体。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.21.htm">4:21</a>）</p><p>耶和华必使暴风如雨般降与恶人；作他们杯中的份。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗11.6.htm">11:6</a>）</p><p>耶和华手里有杯，祂混杂了这酒，使杯内满了搀杂的料，就倒出来；地上的一切恶人必喝。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗75.8.htm">75:8</a>）</p><p>拜兽的必喝神烈怒的酒，此酒斟在神愤怒的杯中纯一不杂。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.10.htm">14:10</a>）</p><p>耶路撒冷啊，醒来，兴起，你从耶和华手中喝了祂烈怒的杯；喝了杯中那令人发颤的残渣。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.17.htm">51:17</a>）</p><p>那女人手拿金杯，杯中盛满了可憎之物，就是她淫乱的污秽。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.4.htm">17:4</a>）</p><p>按她所行的加倍地报应她；用她调酒的杯，加倍地调给她喝。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.6.htm">18:6</a>）</p><p>我必使耶路撒冷向众民成为令人发颤的杯。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.2.htm">12:2</a>）</p><p>你这瞎眼的法利赛人，先洗净杯子的里面，好叫外面也干净了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.25.htm">23:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.26.htm">26</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.39.htm">11:39</a>）</p><p>耶稣对西庇太的两个儿子说，我将要喝的这杯，你们能喝吗？（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.22.htm">20:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.23.htm">23</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.38.htm">10:38</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.39.htm">39</a>）</p><p>耶稣就对彼得说，我父所给我的那杯，我岂可不喝呢？（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约18.11.htm">18:11</a>）</p><p>耶稣在客西马尼园说，倘若可行，求你叫这杯离开我。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.39.htm">26:39</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.42.htm">42</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.44.htm">44</a>）</p><p>耶稣拿起杯来说，你们都喝这个；因为这是我立新约的血。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.27.htm">26:27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.28.htm">28</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.23.htm">14:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.24.htm">24</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.17.htm">22:17</a>）</p><p>耶和华是我的杯，你持守的份。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗16.5.htm">16:5</a>）</p><p>你为我摆设筵席，使我的杯满溢。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗23.5.htm">23:5</a>）</p><p>我拿什么报答耶和华？我要举起救恩的杯。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗116.12.htm">116:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗116.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>喝一杯安慰的酒。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶16.7.htm">16:7</a>）</p><p>“酒杯”、“杯”和“香瓶”、“瓶子”也所表相同（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太9.17.htm">9:17</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路5.37.htm">5:37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路5.38.htm">38</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.12.htm">13:12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.12.htm">48:12</a>；哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.15.htm">2:15</a>）。盛香的“香瓶”、“香炉”、“香盒”与“香”所表相同；总的来说，各种容器和它们里面的事物所表相同。 </p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 672</h4><p>672. <a href="3927/revelation_15_7.htm">15:7</a> Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls. This symbolizes the truths and goods by which evils and falsities in the church are exposed, drawn from the literal sense of the Word.<p>The four living creatures, being cherubim, symbolize the Word in its outmost expressions, and protections to keep its genuine truths and goods from being violated, as may be seen in no. <a href="239.htm">239</a> above. And because the interior truths and goods in the Word are protected by its literal meaning, therefore that meaning of the Word is symbolized by one of the four living creatures.<p>The seven bowls have the same symbolic meaning as the seven plagues, for the bowls are vessels, and vessels in the Word have the same symbolic meaning as their contents. So for example, a cup has the same symbolic meaning as the wine in it, and a dish the same symbolic meaning as the food. That cups, goblets, bowls, plates and saucers have the same symbolic meaning as their contents may be seen from the passages that follow after this.<p>We have already said what the seven angels symbolize above.<p>The angels were given the bowls because the subject is the influx of truth and goodness into the church in order to expose its evils and falsities, and naked goods and truths cannot flow in, as they are not accepted, but truths clothed can, such as are found in the literal sense of the Word. Moreover, the Lord also operates always from inmost elements through outmost ones, or in fullness. This is the reason the angels were given bowls, which symbolize containing truths and goods such as constitute the Word's literal sense, by which falsities and evils are exposed.<p>That the literal sense of the Word is a containing vessel may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, <a href="../ss/27.htm">27-36</a>nos. and <a href="../ss/37.htm">37-49</a>.</p><p>[2] That bowls, saucers, cups and goblets, and also wineskins, have the same symbolic meaning as the things they contain can be seen from the following passages:<p>(Jehovah said,) "Take this... cup of wrath from My hand, and cause all the nations... to drink... ...when they refuse to take the cup..., then you shall say to them, '...You shall surely drink!'"

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 672</h4><p>672. [verse 7] 'And one of the four animals gave unto the seven angels seven golden phials' signifies those truths and goods by means of which the evils and untruths of the Church are disclosed taken from the sense of the letter of the Word. That 'the four animals,' which are cherubs, signify the Word in ultimates, and guards lest its genuine truths and goods should be violated, may be seen above (<a href="239.htm">239</a>). And since the interior truths and goods of the Word are guarded by the sense of its letter, therefore that sense of the Word is signified by 'one of the four animals.' By the 'seven phials' is signified a similar thing as by the 'seven plagues,' for they are containants, and by the containants in the Word like things are signified as by the contents, as by 'a cup' the same as by 'wine,' and by 'a dish' the same as by food. That by 'cups,' 'goblets,' 'phials' and 'plates' similar things are signified as by their contents will be seen in the things now following. What is signified by 'the seven angels' has been said above. The phials were given to them because it treats of the influx of truth and good into the Church so that evils and untruths may be disclosed: and naked goods and truths cannot inflow, for these are not received; but truths clothed, such as are in the sense of the letter of the Word. Moreover, the Lord always operates out of inmosts by means of ultimates, or in fullness. This is why the angels were given the 'phials,' by which are signified the containing truths and goods such as are of the sense of the letter of the Word. By these, untruths and evils are discovered.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 672</h4><p>672. Verse 7. And one of the four animals gave to the seven angels seven golden vials, signifies those truths and goods by which the evils and falsities of the church are disclosed, taken from the sense of the letter of the Word. That "the four animals," which are cherubim, signify the Word in ultimates, and guards lest its genuine truths and goods should be violated, may be seen above, (<a href="239.htm">239</a>); and because the interior truths and goods of the Word are guarded by the sense of its letter, that sense of the Word is therefore signified by "one of the four animals." The same is signified by "the seven vials" as by "the seven plagues," for they are that which contains; and that which contains in the Word signifies the same as the things which are contained; as by "a cup" the same as by "wine," and by "a platter" the same as by "food." That by "cups," "goblets," "vials," and "plates," similar things are signified as by their contents, will be seen in what now follows. What is signified by "the seven angels" has been said above. That "vials were given to them," is because the subject treated of is the influx of truth and good into the church, that evils and falsities may be disclosed; and naked goods and truths cannot flow in, for these are not received; but truths clothed, such as are in the sense of the letter of the Word. And besides, the Lord always operates from inmosts through ultimates, or in fullness. This is the reason that "vials were given to the angels," by which is signified, containing truths and goods such as those are of the sense of the letter of the Word, by which falsities and evils are detected.
