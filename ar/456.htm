<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第456节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>456.启9:20.“其余未曾被这些灾所杀的人”表新教教会中那些没有像前者那样在灵性上因幻想的推理、自我之爱、对自己聪明的骄傲，以及由此而来的欲望而死亡，然而还是使唯信成为其宗教信仰之首的人。“其余的人”是指那些虽不像前者，然而仍使唯信成为其宗教信条之首的人；“未曾被杀的人”表示那些没有在灵性上如此死亡的人；他们所陷入的“这些灾”是指自我之爱，对自己聪明的骄傲，以及由这二者而来的对邪恶与虚假的欲望；这三者以“火”、“烟”和“硫磺”来表示，如前所述（<a href="452.htm">452</a>，<a href="453.htm">453</a>节）。从下文可以看出，这就是“灾”的含义。</p><p>不过，有必要先说说这类人：我蒙恩得以看到他们，并与其交谈。他们住在朝西的北部区域，其中有些人所住的小屋有屋顶，有些人则连屋顶也没有。他们的床是用芦苇编的，衣服是山羊毛的。在从天堂所流入的光中，他们的脸显得很苍白，也很愚钝。原因在于，对于宗教，除了有一位神，有三个位格，基督为他们在十字架上受难，他们凭唯信而得救、在殿里敬拜、定期祷告之外，他们再也不知道别的了。至于其它与宗教及其教义有关的事，他们则一概不予理睬；因为世俗和肉体的事务塞满并窒息了他们的头脑，使他们对其它事充耳不闻。他们当中有很多是长老，我问他们：“当你们在圣言中读到关于行为、爱与仁、果子、生活的戒律、悔改，简言之，就是要行出来的事时，你们是怎么想的？”他们回答说，他们的确读到这些内容，因而看过它们，但也没有看见，因为他们的心思都在唯信上，因而以为所有这些都是信，没有想到它们是信的效果。这种无知和愚蠢就盛行在那些信奉唯信，使它成为其宗教信仰的全部之人当中，这一事实几乎令人难以置信；然而，我蒙恩通过大量经历得知这一点。</p><p>“灾”（plague，或译为伤痕、瘟疫、灾殃、祸等）是指属灵的灾，人的灵或灵魂便因这属灵的灾而死亡。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>你的损伤无法医治，你的伤痕极其深重；我必使你痊愈，医好你的伤痕。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶30.12.htm">30:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶30.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶30.17.htm">17</a>）</p><p>凡经过巴比伦的都因她的灾殃嗤笑。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.13.htm">50:13</a>）</p><p>在一天之内，灾殃，就是死亡、悲哀、饥荒都要临到巴比伦。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.8.htm">18:8</a>）</p><p>我又看见七位天使掌管末了的七灾、因为神的大怒在这七灾中发尽了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.1.htm">15:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>祸哉，犯罪的民族，罪孽沉重的百姓；从脚掌到头顶，没有一处完全的，尽是创伤、鞭痕与新打的伤痕，都没有收口，没有缠裹，也没有用膏滋润。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.4.htm">1:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>当耶和华缠裹祂百姓的损处，医治他们伤痕的日子。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.26.htm">30:26</a>）</p><p>此外还有其它地方（如申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.59.htm">28:59</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.17.htm">49:17</a>；撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.12.htm">14:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.15.htm">15</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路7.21.htm">7:21</a>；启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.6.htm">11:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.21.htm">16:21</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 456</h4><p>456. But the rest of mankind, who were not killed in these plagues. (<a href="3927/revelation_9_20.htm">9:20</a>) This symbolizes people in the Protestant Reformed Church who were not as spiritually dead as the former were because of their illusory reasonings and love of self, a conceit in their own intelligence, and the attendant lusts, and yet who made faith alone the chief tenet of their religion.<p>The rest of mankind mean people who are not like those described, but who still make faith alone the chief tenet of their religion. Their not being killed symbolizes people not so spiritually dead. The plagues in which the former were killed mean a love of self, a conceit in their own intelligence, and the attendant lusts for evil and falsity, because these three are symbolized by fire, smoke and brimstone, as discussed above in nos. <a href="452.htm">452</a>, <a href="453.htm">453</a>. We will see below that plagues have this symbolism. But first we must say something about the people:</p><p>[2] I have been given to see these people, too, and to speak with them. They live in the northern zone over to the west. Some of them have huts there with roofs, others huts without roofs. Their beds are made of rushes, their clothes of goats' hair. Seen in the light that flows in from heaven, their faces have a leaden color and also lack vitality. The reason is that they know nothing more from their religion than that there is a God, that there are three persons, that Christ suffered the cross for them, and that they are saved by means of faith alone, and in addition by worship in churches and prayers at set times. To anything else pertaining to religion and its tenets they pay no attention. For the worldly and personal concerns that occupy and fill their minds shut their ears to them.<p>Many of them were church elders, and I asked them what their thinking was when they read about works, love and charity, fruits, precepts for life, repentance - in word, about things that must be done. They replied that they had indeed read these things and so had seen them, but still did not see them, because they kept their mind focused on faith alone. Consequently they said that these all constitute faith, and that they did not think of them as being the effects of faith.<p>The ignorance and stupidity of people once they have embraced faith alone and made it the whole of their religion is such as to be scarcely believable, even though I have been given to witness it by a good deal of experience.</p><p>[3] That plagues symbolize spiritual plagues, which cause a person to die in spirit or as regards his soul, is apparent from the following passages:<p>Your rupture is hopeless, your plague severe... ...I will restore health to you and heal you of your plagues... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_30_12.htm">Jeremiah 30:12</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_30_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_30_17.htm">17</a>)<p>Everyone who goes by Babylon shall... hiss at all her plagues. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_13.htm">Jeremiah 50:13</a>)<p>...plagues will come (to Babylon) in one day - death and mourning... (<a href="3927/revelation_18_8.htm">Revelation 18:8</a>)<p>I saw... seven angels having the seven last plagues, by which the wrath of God is to be consummated. (<a href="3927/revelation_15_1.htm">Revelation 15:1</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_15_6.htm">6</a>)<p>Woe to a sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity... From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it. A wound and a scar and a fresh plague - these have not been expressed, bound up, or soothed with ointment. (<a href="3927/isaiah_1_4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_1_6.htm">6</a>)<p>In the day that Jehovah will bind up the fracture of His people and heal the wound of its plague. (<a href="3927/isaiah_30_26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>)<p>So, too, elsewhere, as in <a href="3927/deuteronomy_28_59.htm">Deuteronomy 28:59</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_49_17.htm">Jeremiah 49:17</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_12.htm">Zechariah 14:12</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_15.htm">15</a>, <a href="3927/luke_7_21.htm">Luke 7:21</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_11_6.htm">Revelation 11:6</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_16_21.htm">16:21</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 456</h4><p>456. [verse 20] 'And the rest of the men who were not slain in these plagues' signifies those in the Church of the Reformed who are not in this manner spiritually dead as a result of visionary reasonings and the love of self, the pride of self-intelligence and the consequent lusts, like those before mentioned, and yet have made faith alone the head of their religion. By 'the rest of the men' are understood those who are not such, but yet make faith alone the head of their religion; by 'who were not slain' are signified those who are not in this manner spiritually dead; and by the 'plagues' in which [they were not slain] are understood the love of self, the pride of self-intelligence, and the lusts of evil and untruth therefrom, which three are signified by the 'fire' smoke' and 'sulphur' treated of above (<a href="452.htm">452-453</a>). That 'plagues' signify such things will be seen below. But first something shall be said concerning this [group of persons].</p><p>[2] <sup>1</sup>It has been given me to see them also, and to speak with them. They live in the northern quarter towards the west, where some of them have huts with roofs, and some without roofs. Their beds are of rushes, their garments of goats' hair. In the light inflowing out of heaven there is a leaden and also a numb appearance in their faces. This is because they know nothing derived from religion, except that there is a God, that there are three Persons, that Christ endured the cross for them, and that it is faith alone by means of which they are saved, as well as by means of the worship in church buildings, and prayers at appointed times. To the rest of the things that are of religion and the doctrine thereof they pay no attention; for the worldly and corporeal things with which their minds have been crammed and choked stop up their ears to them. Among them are many of the presbyters, whom I asked, 'When you are reading in the Word of works, of love and charity, of fruits, of precepts of life, of repentance, in a word, of things to be done, what are you thinking?' They replied that they did indeed read them and so saw them, but yet they did not see because they kept their minds on faith alone, and consequently that all these things are faith, and that they did not think them to be effects of faith. That there is such ignorance and stupidity with those who have once embraced faith alone and made it everything of their religion is scarcely credible; nevertheless it has been granted [me] to know it by much experience.</p><p>[3] That by 'plagues' are signified the spiritual plagues by means of which a man dies in spirit or soul is plain from these passages:<p>Thy breaking away is hopeless, thy plague is grievous; I will restore health to thee, I will heal thee from thy plagues. <a href="3927/jeremiah_30_12.htm">Jeremiah 30:12</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_30_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_30_17.htm">17</a>.<p>Everyone going across Babylon, shall hiss over all her plagues. <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_13.htm">Jeremiah 50:13</a>.<p>In one day there shall come plagues to Babylon, death and lamentation. <a href="3927/revelation_18_8.htm">Revelation 18:8</a>.<p>I saw seven angels having the seven last plagues, by which the wrath of God is to be consummated. <a href="3927/revelation_15_1.htm">Revelation 15:1</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_15_6.htm">6</a>.<p>Woe to the sinful nation, to a people laden with iniquity, from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it, a wound, a scar, and a recent plague, not pressed out not bound up, not softened with oil. <a href="3927/isaiah_1_4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_1_6.htm">6</a>.<p>In the day that Jehovah shall bind up the breach of His people, and shall heal the wound of their plague. <a href="3927/isaiah_30_26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>.<p>Besides elsewhere, as <a href="3927/deuteronomy_28_59.htm">Deuteronomy 28:59</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_49_17.htm">Jeremiah 49:17</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_14_12.htm">Zechariah 14:12</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/luke_7_21.htm">Luke 7:21</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_11_6.htm">Revelation 11:6</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_16_21.htm">16:21</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;This section is in inverted commas in the Original.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 456</h4><p>456. Verse 20. And the rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues, signifies those in the church of the Reformed, who are not so spiritually dead from visionary reasonings and from self-love, the pride of their own intelligence, and from the lusts thence, as the former, and yet have made faith alone the head of their religion. By "the rest of the men" are meant they who are not as the former, but yet make faith alone the head of their religion; by "those who were not killed," are signified those who are not so spiritually dead; by "these plagues" in which they are, self-love, the pride of their own intelligence, and the lusts of evil and falsity from them are meant; these three being signified by "fire," "smoke," and "brimstone," concerning which above, (<a href="452.htm">452</a>, <a href="453.htm">453</a>). That such is the signification of "plagues," will be seen below.</p><p>[2] But something must first be said respecting this class of persons, whom also it has been granted me to see and to converse with. They dwell in the northern quarter towards the west, where some of them have cottages with roofs, and some without roofs. Their beds are of bulrushes, their garments of goat's hair. In the light flowing in from heaven their faces appear livid and also stupid. The reason is, because they know nothing more about religion than that there is a God, that there are three Persons, that Christ suffered for them on the cross, and that it is faith alone by which they are saved; and likewise by worship in temples, and by prayers at stated times. As to the rest of the things relating to religion and its doctrine, they pay no attention; for the worldly and corporeal things, with which their minds are filled and overcharged, close up their ears against them. There are many of the presbyters among them, whom I asked, "What do you think, when you read in the Word of works, of love and charity, of fruits, of the precepts of life, of repentance, in brief of things to be done?" They replied, that they did indeed read them, and thus saw them; but still they did not see them, because they held their minds in faith alone, and therefore thought that all these were faith, and did not think that they were effects of faith. That such ignorance and stupidity prevails with those who have embraced faith alone, and made it the all of their religion, is scarcely credible; nevertheless it has been granted me to know it by much experience.</p><p>[3] That by plagues are meant spiritual plagues, by means of which man dies as to his spirit or soul, is evident from these passages:<p>Thy breach is desperate, thy plague grievous; I will restore health unto thee, I will heal thee of thy plagues, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_30_12.htm">Jeremiah 30:12</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_30_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_30_17.htm">17</a>).<p>Everyone that passeth by Babylon shall hiss at all her plagues, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_50_13.htm">Jeremiah 50:13</a>).<p>In one day shall the plagues come upon Babylon, death and lamentation, (<a href="3927/revelation_18_8.htm">Revelation 18:8</a>).<p>I saw the seven angels that had the seven last plagues, by which the anger of God is to be consummated, (<a href="3927/revelation_15_1.htm">Revelation 15:1</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_15_6.htm">6</a>).<p>Woe to the sinful nation, to the people heavy with iniquity; from the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it, a wound and a scar and a recent stroke, not pressed, not bound up, not softened with oil, (<a href="3927/isaiah_1_4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_1_6.htm">6</a>).<p>In the day that Jehovah bound up the breach of His people, and healed the wound of their plague, (<a href="3927/isaiah_30_26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a> and other places, as <a href="3927/deuteronomy_28_59.htm">Deuteronomy 28:59</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_49_17.htm">Jeremiah 49:17</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_14_12.htm">Zechariah 14:12</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/luke_7_21.htm">Luke 7:21</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_11_6.htm">Revelation 11:6</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_16_21.htm">16:21</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 456 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>456. (Vers. 20.) "Et reliqui homines, qui non occisi sunt in plagis his," significat illos in Ecclesia Reformatorum, qui non ita sunt spiritualiter mortui ex ratiociniis visionariis, et ex amore sui, fastu propriae intelligentiae, et ex concupiscentiis in de, sicut priores, et usque solam fidem fecerunt caput religionis suae. - Per "reliquos homines" intelliguntur illi qui non tales sunt, sed usque solam fidem faciunt caput religionis suae; per "qui non occisi sunt," significantur qui non ita spiritualiter mortui sunt; per "plagas" in quibus, intelliguntur amor Sui, fastus propriae intelligentiae, et concupiscentiae mali et falsi ex illis, quae tria significantur per "ignem," "fumum" et "Sulphur," de quibus supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_452" target=_top>452</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_453" target=_top>453</a>); <sup>1</sup>quod "plagae" significent talia, videbitur infra. <p>Sed de his primum aliquid dicetur: - Hos quoque datum est videre, et cum illis loqui.

In luce influente e Caelo apparet in faciebus illorum livor et quoque stupor. Causa est, quia nihil aliud ex religione sciunt, quam quod Deus sit, quod tres Personae sint, quod Christus passus sit crucem pro illis, et quod sola fides sit per quam salvantur, et insuper per cultum in templis, et per preces statis temporibus: ad reliqua quae religionis et ejus doctrinae sunt, nihil attendunt; mundana enim et corporea, quibus mentes illorum refertae et oppletae sunt, occludunt eorum aures ad illa. <p>Sunt plures ex Presbyteris inter illos, quos quaesivi, "Quid cogitavistis, cum in Verbo legistis de Operibus, de Amore et Charitate, de Fructibus, de Praeceptis Vitae, de Paenitentia, verbo de Faciendis." <p>Responderunt quod quidem illa legerint et sic viderint; sed usque non viderint, quia mentem tenuerunt in sola fide, et inde quod illa omnia sint fides, et quod non cogitaverint quod sint effecta fidei. <p>Quod talis inscitia et stupiditas sit illis qui solam fidem semel amplexi sunt, et illam omne religionis suae fecerunt, vix potest credi, cum tamen id per multam experientiam datum est scire. <p>Quod per "plagas" significentur plagae spirituales, per quas homo moritur spiritu seu anima, patet ex his locis: <p>"Desperatum confractioni tuae, aegra Plaga tua; ascendere faciam sanitatem tibi, a Plagis tuis sanabo te," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_30_12" target=_top>Jeremias 30:12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_30_14" target=_top>14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_30_17" target=_top>17</a>);<p>"Omnis transiens super Babelem, sibilabit super omnibus Plagis ejus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_50_13" target=_top>Jeremias 50:13</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>"In una die venient Plagae Babyloni, mors et planctus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_18_8" target=_top>Apocalypsis 18:8</a>); <sup>3</sup><p>"Vidi septem Angelos habentes septem Plagas ultimas, per quas consummanda est ira Dei," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_15_1" target=_top>Apocalypsis 15:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_15_6" target=_top>6</a>); <sup>4</sup><p>Vae genti peccatrici, populo gravi iniquitate: a vola pedis usque ad caput non in eo integritas, Vulnus et Cicatrix et Plaga recens, non expressa, non obligata, non emollita oleo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_1_4" target=_top>Esaias 1:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_1_6" target=_top>6</a>);<p>In die quo obligabit Jehovah fracturam populi Sui, et vulnus Plagae ejus sanabit," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_30_26" target=_top>Esaias 30:26</a>).<p>(Praeter alibi, ut <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_28_59" target=_top>Deuteronomius 28:59</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_49_17" target=_top>Jeremias 49:17</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_14_12" target=_top>Sacharias 14:12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_14_15" target=_top>15</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_7_21" target=_top>Luca 7:21</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_11_6" target=_top>Apocalypsis 11:6</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_16_21" target=_top>16:21</a>). <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;452 pro "432"<br>2.&nbsp;13 pro "30"<p>3.&nbsp;8 pro "18"<p>4.&nbsp;1, 6 pro "16" </p>
