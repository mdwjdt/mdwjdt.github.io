<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第707节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>707.启16:16.“他就把他们聚集在一个地方，希伯来话叫作哈米吉多顿”表虚假与真理争战的状态和摧毁新教会的意图，皆源于对统治和优越感之爱。“聚集在一个地方”，在此争战，表示煽动以虚假与真理争战。这是争战的状态，因为“地方”表示事物的状态。这是出于摧毁新教会的意图，因为所表示的是新旧教会之间的争战，争战目的在于摧毁。下文将说明，“哈米吉多顿”表示什么。之前经上一直在说：</p><p>龙去与妇人其余的种争战，就是那守神诫命，为耶稣基督作见证的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.17.htm">12:17</a>）</p><p>还有：</p><p>又允许从海中上来的兽与圣徒争战。 （启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.7.htm">13:7</a>）</p><p>在本章：</p><p>从龙口兽口并假先知的口中出来的鬼魔的灵出去到大地的众王那里，叫他们在神全能者的大日聚集争战。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.13.htm">16:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.14.htm">14</a>）。</p><p>此处论述的，就是这争战本身，不过，没有描述争战的过程，只提到“哈米吉多顿”所表示的它的状态。</p><p>“哈米吉多顿”（Armageddon）表示天上对荣耀、统治和优越之爱；在希伯来语，“哈米”（Aram或Arom）表示高傲；在古希伯来语，“米吉多”（Megiddo）表示源于高傲的爱，这一点从它在阿拉伯语中的含义明显看出来。在撒迦利亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.11.htm">12:11</a>），“米吉多谷之哈达临门”（Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddo）所表相同。那一章还论述了主的到来，那时犹太教会的终结和主将要建立的新教会的开始，并论述了这些教会之间的冲突；正因如此，那一章多次提及“那日”；“那日”表示主的到来，如前所述（<a href="704.htm">704</a>节）。为明白这一点，我引用以下经文：</p><p>那日，我必使耶路撒冷向众民作一块重石头。到那日，我必以惊惶击打一切马匹，以颠狂击打骑马的。那日，我必使犹大的族长如火盆在木柴中。那日，耶和华必保护耶路撒冷的居民，叫那些被赶出的可以在他们当中。那日，我必设法灭绝来攻击耶路撒冷的众民族。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.3.htm">12:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>最后说：</p><p>那日，耶路撒冷必有哀哭，如米吉多谷之哈达临门的哀哭。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.11.htm">12:11</a>）</p><p>在接下来的一章：</p><p>那日，必给大卫家和耶路撒冷的居民开一个泉源。那日，先知必羞愧，不再穿毛衣哄骗人。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚13.1.htm">13:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚13.4.htm">4</a>） </p><p>“那日”表示主的到来，那时旧教会的终结和新教会的开始，如前所述。不过，该先知书的这一章和接下来两章中的一系列事物若不藉着灵义被揭示出来，就无法明白“米吉多谷”表示什么。这一切已经向我揭开，故将在此予以阐述，不过只能简明扼要地阐述出来。撒迦利亚书第十二章在灵义上描述的是：主即将形成一个新的教会（1节）；那时，旧教会中将不再有任何教义事物，因此他们将逃避它（2，3节）；除了在那些处于圣言并属于新教会的人当中外，对真理的理解将不复存在（4节）；这些人将学习来自主的教义的良善（5节）；然后主凭圣言的真理摧毁一切虚假，以免新教会的教义教导其它东西，而不是真理（6，7节）；那时，该教会将处于有关主的教义（8节）；祂将要摧毁违背该教义的所有人和物（9节）；然后将会有一个来自主的新教会（10节）；教会的一切事物，无论总体还是细节，都将处于悲哀中（11-14节）。这些是第十二章在灵义上的内容。</p><p>第十三章的内容是这些：圣言将为了新教会，并且将向他们打开（1节）；教义和敬拜的虚假将完全被毁灭（2，3节）；旧的预言和教义的教导要止息，不再有教义的虚假（4，5节）；那些在旧教会的人将因意图驱散信主之人而杀害主（6，7节）；凡属这荒废教会的人都将灭亡，那些属新教会的人将被主洁净和教导（8，9节）。这些是第十三章在灵义上的内容。</p><p>第十四章的内容是这些：主与邪恶的争战，以及它们被驱散（1-5节）；然后，将不再有真理，但将有源于主的神性真理（6，7节）；神性真理将从主发出（8，9节）；真理将在新教会中增多，那里将不会有任何邪恶的虚假（10，11节）；凡与这些真理对抗的，都会将自己交给各种虚假（12节）；那将是教会一切事物的毁灭（13-15节）；那时，他们将接近对主的敬拜，甚至通过外在属世的外邦人（16-19节）；那时将有源于仁之善的聪明，敬拜将出于仁之善（20-21节）。这些就是撒迦利亚书12-14这三章在灵义上的内容，之所以被揭示出来，是因为它们还论述了旧教会的最后状态和新教会的最初状态。由于经上说“就把他们聚集在一个地方，希伯来话叫作哈米吉多顿”，故明显可知，该先知书所说的事同样涉及当今教会的最后状态和新教会的最初状态。“哈米吉多顿”表示对荣耀、统治和优越之爱，如前所述；因为争战由此而来，撒迦利亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.11.htm">12:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.14.htm">14</a>）所描述的悲哀就来自并因为这爱。“米吉多”（列王纪下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.29.htm">23:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.30.htm">30</a>；历代志下<a href="http://39-27.cn/代下35.20.htm">35:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/代下35.24.htm">24</a>）也所表相同，不过是在灵义上相同。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 707</h4><p>707. <a href="3927/revelation_16_16.htm">16:16</a> And they gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew Armageddon. This symbolizes a state of combat, of falsities against truths, and, arising from a love of dominion and preeminence, a mind to destroy the New Church.<p>To gather together to the place, in this case for battle, means, symbolically, to incite people to use falsities to fight against truths. It is a state of combat, because a place symbolizes the state of something. It springs from a mind to destroy the New Church, because the combat meant is between the former church and a new one, and the intent of the combat is to destroy. What Armageddon symbolizes we will say below.<p>We were told previously that the dragon went off to make war with the rest of the woman's offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ (<a href="3927/revelation_12_17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a>). Also that it was granted the beast from the sea to make war with the saints (<a href="3927/revelation_13_7.htm">Revelation 13:7</a>). Then in this chapter we are told that spirits of demons coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, went away to the kings of the earth to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty (<a href="3927/revelation_16_13.htm">Revelation 16:13-14</a>). And here now the subject is the battle itself, whose outcome is not described, but only its state, which is symbolized by Armageddon.</p><p>[2] Armageddon symbolizes in heaven a love of acclaim, dominion and preeminence, and in Hebrew, too, Aram or Arom symbolizes loftiness, and Megiddo in ancient Hebrew a love in consequence of loftiness, as is apparent from its meaning in Arabic. <sup>1</sup>Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddo has the same symbolic meaning in <a href="3927/zechariah_12_11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a>. The subject of that chapter is also the Lord's advent, the end of the Jewish Church then and the beginning of a new one to be established by the Lord, and a conflict, too, between those churches. That is why we find so many times in that chapter the phrase "in that day," and that day symbolizes the Lord's advent, as in no. <a href="704.htm">704</a> above. For this to be seen, I will quote the passages:<p>...in that day that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all peoples... In that day... I will strike every horse with stupor, and its rider with madness... In that day I will make the leaders of Judah like a fiery furnace in the woodpile... In that day the Lord will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that there may be a force among them... ...in that day... I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_3.htm">Zechariah 12:3-4</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_12_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_12_8.htm">8-9</a>)<p>And finally:<p>In that day there shall be... mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning at Hadad-Rimmon in the valley of Megiddo. (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a>)<p>And in the following chapter:<p>In that day a fountain shall be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem... It shall be in that day that the prophets will be ashamed... and... not put on a robe of coarse hair, so as to deceive. (<a href="3927/zechariah_13_1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_13_4.htm">4</a>)</p><p>[3] That day symbolizes the Lord's advent and the end of the former church and the beginning of a new one, as said above. But what the valley of Megiddo in that chapter symbolizes cannot be seen unless the series of symbolic meanings there and in the two following chapters in that prophetic book are revealed by disclosure of the spiritual sense; and because this series of meanings has been revealed to me, I will say what it is, but in brief summation. In the spiritual sense <a href="3927/zechariah_12_1.htm">Zechariah 12</a> describes the following:<p>The Lord will form a new church (verse <a href="3927/zechariah_12_1.htm">1</a>).<p>The former church will have no doctrine then left in it, and therefore the people will run from it (verses <a href="3927/zechariah_12_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_12_3.htm">3</a>).<p>There will no longer be any understanding of truth, except in people who hold to the Word and will belong to the new church (verse <a href="3927/zechariah_12_4.htm">4</a>).<p>They will learn the goodness of doctrine from the Lord (verse <a href="3927/zechariah_12_5.htm">5</a>).<p>By means of the Word's truths the Lord will destroy all falsities then, lest the doctrine of the new church teach anything other than truth (verses <a href="3927/zechariah_12_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_12_7.htm">7</a>).<p>The church will have then a doctrine regarding the Lord (verse <a href="3927/zechariah_12_8.htm">8</a>). He will destroy everyone and everything that stands in opposition to that doctrine (verse <a href="3927/zechariah_12_9.htm">9</a>), and a new church will exist then from the Lord (verse <a href="3927/zechariah_12_10.htm">10</a>).<p>Each and every part of the church will be in a state of mourning then (verses <a href="3927/zechariah_12_10.htm">10</a> to <a href="3927/zechariah_12_14.htm">14</a>).</p><p>[4] These are the contents of Chapter <a href="3927/zechariah_12_1.htm">12</a> in the spiritual sense. The contents of the next chapter, <a href="3927/zechariah_13_1.htm">Zechariah 13</a>, are as follows:<p>For the new church there will be a Word, and it will lie open to them (verse <a href="3927/zechariah_13_1.htm">1</a>).<p>Falsities in their doctrine and worship will be entirely destroyed (verses <a href="3927/zechariah_13_2.htm">2</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_13_3.htm">3</a>).<p>The former prophetic or doctrinal teaching will cease, and there will no longer be any falsities in their doctrine (verses <a href="3927/zechariah_13_4.htm">4</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_13_5.htm">5</a>).<p>People in the former church will kill the Lord, with the intention of dispersing those who believe in Him (verses <a href="3927/zechariah_13_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_13_7.htm">7</a>).<p>Those of the devastated church will perish, while those of the new church will be purified and taught by the Lord (verses <a href="3927/zechariah_13_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_13_9.htm">9</a>).</p><p>[5] These are the contents of chapter <a href="3927/zechariah_13_1.htm">13</a> in the spiritual sense. The contents of chapter <a href="3927/zechariah_14_1.htm">14</a> are as follows:<p>The combats of the Lord against evil people and their dispersion (verses <a href="3927/zechariah_14_1.htm">1</a> to <a href="3927/zechariah_14_5.htm">5</a>).<p>The absence of any truth then other than Divine truth from the Lord (verses <a href="3927/zechariah_14_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_7.htm">7</a>).<p>Divine truth will emanate from the Lord (verses <a href="3927/zechariah_14_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_9.htm">9</a>).<p>Truth in the new church will increase, and there will be in it no falsity that accompanies evil (verses <a href="3927/zechariah_14_10.htm">10</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_11.htm">11</a>).<p>People who fight against those truths will surrender themselves to falsities of every kind (verse <a href="3927/zechariah_14_12.htm">12</a>).<p>The destruction then of every facet of the church (verses <a href="3927/zechariah_14_13.htm">13</a> to <a href="3927/zechariah_14_15.htm">15</a>).<p>People will then turn to worship of the Lord, even from nations that are external and merely natural (verses <a href="3927/zechariah_14_16.htm">16</a> to <a href="3927/zechariah_14_19.htm">19</a>).<p>And their intelligence then, springing from the goodness of charity that produces their worship (verses <a href="3927/zechariah_14_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_21.htm">21</a>).<p>These are the contents of the three chapters, <a href="3927/zechariah_12_1.htm">Zechariah 12</a> to <a href="3927/zechariah_14_1.htm">Zechariah 14</a>, in the spiritual sense, disclosed because they also have as their subject the last state of a former church and the first state of a new church. Moreover, because [in the present verse] we are told that people were to be gathered together to the place called in Hebrew Armageddon, it follows that what is said in Zechariah applies equally to the last state of today's church and to the first state of the New Church.<p>Armageddon symbolizes, as we said, a love of acclaim, dominion and preeminence, for it is because of that love that a conflict arises, and it is because of that love and on its account that there is the mourning described in <a href="3927/zechariah_12_11.htm">Zechariah 12:11-14</a>.<p>Megiddo also has the same symbolic meaning in <a href="3927/2-kings_23_29.htm">2 Kings 23:29-30</a> and <a href="3927/2-chronicles_35_20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20-24</a>, but in the spiritual sense.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Modern scholarship recognizes Armageddon as a combination of the Hebrew har, meaning a mountain or hill, and the place name Megiddo, etymology unknown. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 707</h4><p>707. [verse 16] 'And he gathered them together into the place termed in Hebrew Armageddon' signifies the state of the combat fought against truths with untruths, and the intention (animus) of destroying the New Church, originating out of a love of command and supereminence. By 'to gather together into the place,' here for battle, is signified to incite to fight against truths with untruths. The reason it is the state of combat is because 'place' signifies the state of a thing. It is derived from the intention to destroy the New Church, because a combat between the old Church and the new is understood, and the intention of the combat is to destroy. What is signified by 'Armageddon' will be stated below. It was said before that:<p>The dragon went away to wage war with the remnant of the seed of the woman, keeping the commandments of God, and having the testimony of Jesus Christ. <a href="3927/revelation_12_17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a>; also that:<p>To the beast out of the sea it was given to make war with the saints. <a href="3927/revelation_13_7.htm">Revelation 13:7</a>; and in this chapter that:<p>The spirits of the demons going out of the mouth of the dragon, of the beast and of the false prophet, went away to the kings of the land to gather them together to the war of that great day of God Omnipotent (verses 13-14).<p>Here now it treats of the battle itself. The progress of this is not described, but only the state, which is signified by 'Armageddon.</p><p>[2] By 'Armageddon' is signified in heaven the love of honour, of dominion, and of supereminence. Moreover in the Hebrew language by 'Aram' or 'Arom' is signified loftiness, and in very old Hebrew by 'Megiddon' a love derived from loftiness, as is plain from its signification in the Arabic language. A similar thing is signified in <a href="3927/zechariah_12_11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a> by 'Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.' In that chapter also it treats of the Lord's coming, and of the end of the Jewish Church at that time and of the beginning of a New one to be set up by the Lord, and also of the clash between those Churches. For this reason it is said so many times in that chapter In that day, and by 'that day' is signified the Lord's coming, as above (<a href="704.htm">704</a>). That it may be seen I will quote the passages:<p>In that day I will make Jerusalem a stone of burden unto all peoples. In that day I will smite every horse with numbness and the rider with madness. In that day I will make the leaders of Judah like a furnace of fire among the firewood. In that day Jehovah shall protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that outcasts may be among them. In that day I will seek to destroy all the nations coming against Jerusalem. (And lastly) In that day there shall be a wailing in Jerusalem, as the wailing in Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon Vers. 3-4, 6, 8-9, 11; and in the following chapter:<p>In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. In that day the prophets shall be ashamed, and shall put on a tunic of hair that they may deceive [Zechariah] <a href="3927/zechariah_13_1.htm">13:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_13_4.htm">4</a>.</p><p>[3] By 'that day' is signified the Lord's coming and the end of the old Church at that time and the beginning of a New Church, as was said above. But what is signified there by 'the valley of Megiddon' cannot be seen unless the series of things in that chapter and in the following two in that Prophet be disclosed by means of the spiritual sense. And because this has been disclosed to me it will be stated, but in a short summary. In chapter <a href="3927/zechariah_12_1.htm">12</a> in Zechariah there is described in the spiritual sense:<p>That the Lord is going to form a New Church (verse 1).<p>That there will not then be anything of doctrine in the Old Church, and that therefore they are going to flee from it (2-3).<p>That [there will be] no longer any understanding of truth, except with those who are in the Word, and who belong to the New Church (4).<p>That these will learn the good of doctrine from the Lord (5).<p>That then the Lord by means of the truths of the Word will destroy all untruths, lest the doctrine of the New Church should teach anything other than what is true (6-7).<p>That then the Church will be in the doctrine concerning the Lord (8).<p>That He is going to destroy all persons and things that are against that doctrine (9).<p>And that then [there will be] a New Church from the Lord (10).<p>And that then all things of the Church collectively and separately will be in mourning (10-14).<p>These are the contents of chapter <a href="3927/revelation_12_1.htm">12</a> in the spiritual sense.</p><p>[4] The contents of the following chapter <a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">13</a> are these:<p>That for the New Church there will be a Word, and this will be opened to them (verse 1).<p>That untruths of doctrine and worship will be destroyed absolutely (2-3).<p>That what is prophetical or doctrinal of long standing is going to fall into disuse; and untruths of doctrine will no longer exist (4-5).<p>That by those who are in the Old Church the Lord will be slain with the intention of scattering those who believe in Him (6-7).<p>That those who belong to the devastated Church are going to perish, and that those who belong to the New Church are to be purified and taught by the Lord (8-9).<p>These are the contents of chapter <a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">13</a> in the spiritual sense.</p><p>[5] The contents of chapter <a href="3927/revelation_19_1.htm">19</a> are these:<p>Concerning the Lord's combats against the evil, and concerning their dispersion (verses 1-5).<p>That then [there will be] nothing true, but from the Lord [will be] Divine Truth (6-7).<p>That Divine Truth will proceed from the Lord (8-9).<p>That the Truth in the New Church will be multiplied, and there will not be untruth of evil there (10-11).<p>That he who fights against those truths will give himself up to untruths of every kind (12).<p>That then [will be] the destruction of all things of the Church (13-15).<p>That then they are going to draw near to the worship of the Lord, even from the nations that are external natural (16-19).<p>And that then [there will be] intelligence derived from the good of charity out of which the worship [will be] (20-21).<p>These are the contents of the three chapters <a href="3927/zechariah_12_1.htm">12</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_13_1.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_14_1.htm">14</a> of Zechariah in the spiritual sense, disclosed because in them also it treats of the last state of the Old Church and the first state of the New Church. And because it is said that they are 'to be gathered together into the place termed in Hebrew Armageddon' it is established that in that Prophet the same things were said concerning the last state of the present Church and concerning the first state of the New Church. By 'Armageddon' is signified, as was said, the love of honour, of dominion and of supereminence, for the combat results from this, and from it and on account of it there is the mourning that is described there (<a href="3927/revelation_12_11.htm">12:11-14</a>). A similar thing is signified by 'Megiddon' (<a href="3927/2-kings_23_29.htm">2 Kings 23:29-30</a>; <a href="3927/2-chronicles_35_20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20-24</a>), but in the spiritual sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 707</h4><p>707. Verse 16. And he gathered them together into the place called in Hebrew Armageddon, signifies a state of combat of falsities against truths, and a desire to destroy the New Church, springing from the love of dominion and preeminence. "To gather together into a place," here to battle, signifies to excite to combat from falsities against truths. It is the state of combat, because "place" signifies the state of a thing. That it is from the purpose of destroying the New Church, is because combat between the Old Church and the New is meant, and the purpose of the combat is to destroy. What is signified by "Armageddon" will be told below. It has been said before, that:<p>The dragon went away to make war with the rest of the seed of the woman, that keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ, (<a href="3927/revelation_12_17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a>);<p>Also that:<p>It was given to the beast out of the sea to make war with the saints, (<a href="3927/revelation_13_7.htm">Revelation 13:7</a>).<p>And in this chapter that:<p>The spirits of demons that went out of the mouth of the dragon, of the beast, and of the false prophet, went away to the kings of the earth, to gather them together to the war of that great day of God Almighty, (<a href="3927/revelation_16_13.htm">Revelation 16:13-14</a>).<p>Here the battle itself is now treated of, the success of which is not described, but only its state, which is signified by "Armageddon."</p><p>[2] By "Armageddon" is signified in heaven the love of honor, of dominion, and of supereminence; and also in the Hebrew language by Aram or Arom loftiness is signified, and love from loftiness is by "Megiddo" in the ancient Hebrew language, as is manifest from its signification in the Arabic language. The same is signified by "Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddo" in <a href="3927/zechariah_12_11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a>. In that chapter the coming of the Lord is also treated of, and the end of the Jewish Church at that time, and the beginning of a New Church to be established by the Lord, and also the collision between those churches; on which account the expression "in that day" so often occurs in that chapter; and by "that day" is signified the Coming of the Lord, as above, (<a href="704.htm">704</a>). That it may be seen, I will adduce the passages:<p>In that day I will make Jerusalem a stone of burden unto all peoples. In that day I will smite every horse with astonishment and his rider with madness. In that day I will make the leaders of Judah like a furnace of fire in wood. In that day Jehovah will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that those driven out may be among them. In that day I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem, (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_3.htm">Zechariah 12:3-4</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_12_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_12_8.htm">8-9</a>).<p>And lastly:<p>In that day there shall be a wailing in Jerusalem like the wailing in Hadradrimmon in the valley of Megiddo, (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a>).<p>And in the following chapter:<p>In that day a fountain shall be opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. In that day the prophets shall be ashamed, and shall put on a garment of hair, that they may deceive, (<a href="3927/zechariah_13_1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_13_4.htm">4</a>).</p><p>[3] By "that day" is signified the coming of the Lord and then the end of the Old Church and the beginning of a New Church, as was said above. But what is signified there by "the valley of Megiddo" cannot be seen, unless the series of things in that chapter and the two following in that prophet be disclosed by means of the spiritual sense; which, as it has been disclosed to me, shall be explained, but in a brief summary. In the twelfth chapter of Zechariah it is described in the spiritual sense:<p>That the Lord is about to form a New Church, (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>).<p>That there will then be nothing of doctrine in the Old Church, and that therefore they will flee from it, (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_2.htm">Zechariah 12:2-3</a>.<p>That there will no longer be any understanding of truth, only with those who are in the Word, and who are of the New Church, (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_4.htm">Zechariah 12:4</a>).<p>That these will learn the good of doctrine from the Lord, (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_5.htm">Zechariah 12:5</a>).<p>That the Lord will then destroy all falsities by the truths of the Word, lest the doctrine of the New Church should teach anything else but the truth, (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_6.htm">Zechariah 12:6-7</a>).<p>That the church will then be in doctrine concerning the Lord, (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_8.htm">Zechariah 12:8</a>).<p>That He will destroy all and all things that are contrary to that doctrine, (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_9.htm">Zechariah 12:9</a>);<p>And that then there will be a New Church from the Lord, (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>).<p>And that then each and everything of the church will be in mourning, (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_10.htm">Zechariah 12:10-14</a>).<p>These are the contents of chapter 12 in the spiritual sense.</p><p>[4] The contents of chapter 13 are these:<p>That the Word will be for the New Church, and will be opened to them, (<a href="3927/zechariah_13_1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a>).<p>That falsities of doctrine and worship will be altogether destroyed, (<a href="3927/zechariah_13_2.htm">Zechariah 13:2-3</a>).<p>That the old prophetic or doctrinal teaching is to cease, and that there will no longer be falsities of doctrine, (<a href="3927/zechariah_13_4.htm">Zechariah 13:4-5</a>).<p>That the Lord will be slain by those who are in the Old church, from their intention to disperse them that believe in Him, (<a href="3927/zechariah_13_6.htm">Zechariah 13:6-7</a>).<p>That they who are of the vastated church will perish, and that those who are of the New Church are to be purified and taught by the Lord, (<a href="3927/zechariah_13_8.htm">Zechariah 13:8-9</a>).<p>These are the contents of chapter 13 in the spiritual sense.</p><p>[5] The contents of chapter 14 are these:<p>The Lord's combats against the evil, and their dispersion, (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_1.htm">Zechariah 14:1-5</a>).<p>That then there will be no truth, but there will be Divine truth from the Lord, (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_6.htm">Zechariah 14:6-7</a>).<p>That the Divine truth will proceed from the Lord, (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_8.htm">Zechariah 14:8-9</a>).<p>That truth will be multiplied in the New Church, nor will there be any falsity of evil there, (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_10.htm">Zechariah 14:10-11</a>).<p>That he who combats against those truths, will give himself up to falsities of every kind, (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_12.htm">Zechariah 14:12</a>).<p>That then will be the destruction of all things of the church, (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_13.htm">Zechariah 14:13-15</a>).<p>That they will then approach to the worship of the Lord, even from the Gentiles who are external natural, (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_16.htm">Zechariah 14:16-19</a>).<p>And that then there will be intelligence from the good of charity, from which will be their worship, (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_20.htm">Zechariah 14:20-21</a>).<p>These are the contents of the three chapters, 12-14 of Zechariah, in the spiritual sense, disclosed because in them also the last state of the Old Church and the first state of the New Church are treated of. And as it is said that "they are to be gathered together into a place called in Hebrew Armageddon," it is evident that the same things were said in this prophet concerning the last state of the church of this day and the first state of the New Church. By "Armageddon" is signified, as was said, the love of honor, of dominion, and of supereminence; for from that is the combat, and from that and on account of it is lamentation which is described there, (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_11.htm">Zechariah 12:11-14</a>). The like is also signified by "Megiddo" (<a href="3927/2-kings_23_29.htm">2 Kings 23:29-30</a>; <a href="3927/2-chronicles_35_20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20-24</a>); but in the spiritual sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 707 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>707. (Vers. 16.) "Et congregavit illos in locum dictum Hebraice Armageddon," significat statum pugnae ex falsis is contra vera, et animum destruendi Novam Ecclesiam, oriundum ex amore imperii et supereminentiae. - Per "congregare in locum" hic ad proelium, significatur excitare ad pugnandum ex falsis contra vera; quod sit status pugnae, est quia "locus" significat statum rei; quod sit ex animo destruendi Novam Ecclesiam, est quia pugna inter Ecclesiam veterem et novam intelligitur, et animus pugnae est destruere: quid per "Armageddon" significatur, dicetur infra. Dictum est prius, quod Draco "abiverit ad faciendum bellum cum reliquis ex semine mulieris, observantibus mandata Dei, et habentibus testimonium Jesu Christi," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_707/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_17" target=_top>Apocalypsis 12:17</a>);<p>tum, quod Bestiae ex Mari datum sit "bellum gerere cum sanctis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_707/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_13_7" target=_top>13:7</a>);<p>et in hoc capite, quod spiritus daemonum exeuntes ex ore Draconis, Bestiae et Pseudoprophetae abirent ad reges terrae, "ad congregandum illos in bellum diei illius magni Dei Omnipotentis," (vers. 13, 14); hic nunc agitur de ipso proelio, cujus successus non describitur, sed modo status, qui significatur per "Armageddon." Per "Armageddon" in Caelo significatur amor honoris, imperii et supereminentiae; et quoque in lingua Hebraea per "Aram" seu "Arom" significatur celsitudo, et amor ex celsitudine per "Megiddonem" in lingua vetusta Hebraea, ut patet a significatione ejus in lingua Arabica; simile per "Hadadrimmon in valle Megiddonis" significatur apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_707/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_12_11" target=_top>Sacharias 12:11</a>. In eo capite etiam agitur de Adventu Domini, et tunc de fine Ecclesiae Judaicae et de principio Novae a Domino instaurandae, et quoque de collisione inter illas Ecclesias: quare toties in illo capite dicitur "in Die illo;" et per "Diem illum" significatur Adventus Domini, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_707/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_704" target=_top>704</a>).
