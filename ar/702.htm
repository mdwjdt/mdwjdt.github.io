<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第702节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>702.“三个污秽的灵，好像青蛙”表由此所产生的，无非是推理和歪曲真理的欲望。“灵”在此与“鬼魔”所表相同，因为经上很快说到“他们本是鬼魔的灵”（14节），“鬼魔”（或魔鬼）表示歪曲真理的欲望（<a href="458.htm">458</a>节）。“三”表示全部（<a href="400.htm">400</a>，<a href="505.htm">505</a>节），故在此表示“无非”或只有（nothing but或mere）。“青蛙”表示源自欲望的推理，因为他们像青蛙一样呱呱乱叫，下作淫秽。由此明显可知，“三个污秽的灵，好像青蛙”表示由此所产生的，无非是推理和歪曲真理的欲望。此处“青蛙”和“埃及的青蛙”意思一样，因为发生在埃及人身上的那些神迹同样描述了教会的毁灭，对此，摩西五经上这样记着说:</p><p>亚伦伸手在埃及的诸水以上，青蛙就上来，遮满了这地，后来青蛙被除去，只留在河中。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出8.5.htm">8:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出8.14.htm">14</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.45.htm">78:45</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.30.htm">105:30</a>）</p><p>青蛙之所以从埃及的水中产生，又留在河中，是因为埃及的诸水，尤其是那里的河水，表示教义的虚假，他们通过这些虚假来推理。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 702</h4><p>702. Three unclean spirits like frogs. This symbolically means that there arose nothing but reasonings and lusts to falsify truths.<p>Spirits here have the same symbolism as demons, since we are shortly told that they were spirits of demons, and demons symbolize lusts to falsify truths (no. <a href="458.htm">458</a>). The number three symbolizes all (nos. <a href="400.htm">400</a>, <a href="505.htm">505</a>), here nothing but. Frogs symbolize reasonings prompted by lusts, because they croak and are lascivious.<p>It is apparent from this that three unclean spirits like frogs symbolize nothing but reasonings and lusts to falsify truths.<p>Frogs here have the same symbolic meaning as the frogs in Egypt, because the destruction of the church among the Egyptians is likewise described by the miracles done, regarding which we are thus told in Exodus:<p>Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land... (<a href="3927/exodus_8_5.htm">Exodus 8:5-14</a>, cf. <a href="3927/psalms_78_45.htm">Psalms 78:45</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_105_30.htm">105:30</a>)<p>And later the frogs were removed, remaining only in the river (<a href="3927/exodus_8_11.htm">Exodus 8:11-13</a>).<p>Frogs were produced from the waters of Egypt and remained in the river because the waters in Egypt, and especially those in the river there, symbolized doctrinal falsities on which the people based their reasoning. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 702</h4><p>702. 'Three unclean spirits like frogs' signifies that nothing but reasonings and the lusts of falsifying truths were arising. By 'spirits' here are signified the like as by demons, for it is presently said that they were 'the spirits of demons,' and by 'demons' are signified the lusts of falsifying truths (<a href="458.htm">458</a>). By 'three' are signified all (<a href="400.htm">400</a>, <a href="505.htm">505</a>), here therefore 'nothing but' (mere). By 'frogs' are signified reasonings derived from lusts, because they croak and are prurient. From these considerations it is plain that by 'three unclean spirits like frogs' are signified nothing but reasonings and the lusts of falsifying truths. The 'frogs' here have no other signification than 'the frogs of Egypt' have, because by the miracles done with the Egyptians the devastation of the Church is likewise described, concerning which [it is written] thus in Moses:<p>Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and frogs came up and covered the land, and afterwards the frogs were removed and remained in the river only, <a href="3927/exodus_8_5.htm">Exodus 8:5-14</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/exodus_8_1.htm">1-10</a>]; <a href="3927/psalms_78_45.htm">Psalms 78:45</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_105_30.htm">105:30</a>.<p>The reason why frogs were produced out of the waters of Egypt and remained in the river was because the waters of Egypt, and especially the waters of the river there, used to signify the untruths of the doctrine out of which they reasoned. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 702</h4><p>702. Three unclean spirits like frogs, signifies there arise mere reasonings and cupidities of falsifying truths. By "spirits" the same is here signified as by demons, because it is presently said that they were "spirits of demons," and by "demons," are signified the lusts of falsifying truths, (<a href="458.htm">458</a>). By "three" are signified all, (<a href="400.htm">400</a>, <a href="505.htm">505</a>), here therefore mere; by "frogs" are signified reasonings from lusts, because they croak, and have itching desires; hence it is plain, that by "the three unclean spirits like frogs," are signified mere reasonings and lusts of falsifying truths. "Frogs" here have a like signification with "the frogs of Egypt," because the devastation of the church with the Egyptians is in like manner described by the miracles performed, concerning which it is thus written in Moses:<p>Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up, and covered the land, and afterwards the frogs were removed, and remained in the river only, (<a href="3927/exodus_8_5.htm">Exodus 8:5-14</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_78_45.htm">Psalms 78:45</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_105_30.htm">105:30</a>).<p>The reason why frogs were produced from the waters of Egypt, and remained in the river, was, because the waters in Egypt, and especially the waters of its rivers, signified the falsities of doctrine from which they reasoned. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 702 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>702. "Spiritus tres immundos similes ranis," significat quod orirentur merae ratiocinationes et cupiditates falsificandi vera. -Per "spiritus" significantur hic similia quae per daemones, quoniam mox dicitur quod essent "spiritus daemonum;" et per "daemones" significantur cupiditates falsificandi vera (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_702/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_458" target=_top>458</a>); per "tres" significantur omnia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_702/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_400" target=_top>400</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_702/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_505" target=_top>505</a>), hic itaque mere; per "ranas" significantur ratiocinationes ex cupiditatibus, quia coaxant, et prurigines sunt: ex his patet quod per "spiritus tres immundos si miles ranis" significentur merae ratiocinationes et cupiditates falsificandi vera. Per "ranas" hic non aliud significatur quam quod per "ranas Aegypti," quia devastatio Ecclesiae apud Aegyptios per miracula facta aeque describitur; de quibus ita apud Mosen: <p>"Extendit Aharon manum suam super aquas Aegypti, et ascendit Rana, et operuit terram; et postea remotae sunt ranae, et tantum in flumine supererant," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_702/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_8_1-10" target=_top>Exodus 8:1-10</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_702/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_8_5-14" target=_top>5-14</a>); <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_702/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_78_45" target=_top>Psalm 78:45</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_702/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_105_30" target=_top>Psalm 105:30</a>).<p>Quod ranae productae fuerint ex aquis Aegypti, et superessent in flumine, erat quia aquae in Aegypto, et imprimis aquae fluminis ibi, significabant falsa doctrinae ex quibus ratiocinati sunt. </p>
