<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第902节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>902.启21:14.“城墙有十二根基”表字义中的圣言包含新教会教义的全部事物。“城墙”表示字义中的圣言（<a href="898.htm">898</a>节）；“十二根基”表示教会教义的全部事物；“根基”表示教义，“十二”表示全部。教会建立在教义的基础上，因为教义教导我们如何去信，如何去生活，而教义只从圣言，而非其它源头被汲取；教义来自圣言的字义，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/50.htm">50</a>-61节）。由于“新耶路撒冷城墙的十二根基”表示教义的全部事物，并且教会凭教义而成为教会，所以下文（21:19-20）详细论述了它的根基。在圣言中，“地的根基”（或地基）有时被提及，但它们不是指大地的根基，而是指教会的根基，因为“地”表示教会（<a href="285.htm">285</a>节），教会的根基就是来自圣言，被称为教义；事实上，正是圣言本身建立了教会。</p><p>在以下经文中，“根基”也表示取自圣言的教义：</p><p>你们没有明白立地的根基吗？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.21.htm">40:21</a>）</p><p>我将我的话放在你口中，为要栽定诸天，立定地基。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.16.htm">51:16</a>）</p><p>你们不承认，也不明白，在黑暗中行走，地的一切根基都摇动了。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗82.5.htm">82:5</a>）</p><p>耶和华的话铺张诸天，建立地基，造人中间的灵。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.1.htm">12:1</a>）</p><p>耶和华在锡安使火着起，烧毁锡安的根基。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.11.htm">4:11</a>） </p><p>恶人暗中射那心里正直的人，因为根基毁坏了。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗11.2.htm">11:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗11.3.htm">3</a>）</p><p>诸山和大地牢固的根基啊，你们要听耶和华的争辩，因为耶和华要与祂的百姓争辩。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥6.2.htm">6:2</a>）</p><p>高处的罅隙都开了，地的根基也震动了，地全然粉碎，尽都崩裂，大大地震动了。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.18.htm">24:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.20.htm">20</a>）</p><p>此外还有其它地方（如以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.32.htm">14:32</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.13.htm">48:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.13.htm">51:13</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗24.2.htm">24:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗102.25.htm">102:25</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.5.htm">104:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.6.htm">6</a>；撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上22.8.htm">22:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上22.16.htm">16</a>）。人若不认为“地”表示教会，当读到“地的根基”（或地基）时，在此只会作属世的，甚至物质的思考；若不认为此处的“耶路撒冷城”表示教会，当他读到城墙、城门、根基、街道、尺寸和本章所描述有关城的其它细节时，情形也一样；而事实上，它们都涉及教会，因而不可作属世的理解，而要作属灵的理解。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 902</h4><p>902. <a href="3927/revelation_21_14.htm">21:14</a> And the wall of the city had twelve foundations. This symbolically means that the Word in its literal sense contains all of the doctrines of the New Church.<p>The wall of the city symbolizes the Word in its literal sense (no. <a href="898.htm">898</a>), and its twelve foundations symbolize all of the doctrines of the church - its foundations symbolizing doctrines, and the number twelve all. The church, moreover, is founded on doctrine, for it teaches how a person is to believe and live, and its doctrine is to be drawn only from the Word. That it is to be drawn from the Word's literal sense may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="../ss/50.htm">50-61</a>.<p>Since the twelve foundations of the wall of the city New Jerusalem symbolize all of the church's doctrine, and the church is a church by virtue of its doctrine, therefore its foundations are described in more detail in verses <a href="3927/revelation_21_19.htm">19</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_21_20.htm">20</a> below.<p>The foundations of the earth are mentioned a number of times in the Word, and they do not mean the foundations of the earth, but the foundations of the church, inasmuch as the earth symbolizes the church (no. <a href="285.htm">285</a>). And the foundations of the church are only ones that come from the Word and are called doctrines. For it is the Word itself that provides a foundation for the church.</p><p>[2] Doctrines drawn from the Word are symbolized by foundations also in the following passages:<p>Have you not understood the foundations of the earth? (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_21.htm">Isaiah 40:21</a>)<p>I will put My words in your mouth... to plant the heavens and found the earth... (<a href="3927/isaiah_51_16.htm">Isaiah 51:16</a>)<p>They do not acknowledge, they do not understand, they walk in darkness, all the foundations of the earth shake. (<a href="3927/psalms_82_5.htm">Psalms 82:5</a>)<p>...the Word of Jehovah... who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundations of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him. (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>)<p>Jehovah... kindled a fire in Zion, which has devoured its foundations. (<a href="3927/lamentations_4_11.htm">Lamentations 4:11</a>)<p>The impious... shoot in darkness the upright in heart, because the foundations are being destroyed... (<a href="3927/psalms_11_2.htm">Psalms 11:2-3</a>)<p>Hear, O mountains, Jehovah's quarrel, you strong foundations of the earth; for Jehovah has a quarrel with His people... (<a href="3927/micah_6_2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>)<p>...the floodgates on high are open, and the foundations of the earth are shaken. The earth is violently broken, the earth is split open, the earth is shaken... (<a href="3927/isaiah_24_18.htm">Isaiah 24:18-20</a>)<p>And so on elsewhere, as in <a href="3927/isaiah_14_32.htm">Isaiah 14:32</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_48_13.htm">48:13</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_51_13.htm">51:13</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_24_2.htm">Psalms 24:2</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_102_25.htm">102:25</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_104_5.htm">104:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/2-samuel_22_8.htm">2 Samuel 22:8</a>, <a href="3927/2-samuel_22_16.htm">16</a>.<p>Whoever does not think that the earth symbolizes the church cannot help but think only naturally, even materially, when he reads in these places about the foundations of the earth. So it would be also if he were not to think of the city Jerusalem here as symbolizing the church when he reads about its wall, gates, foundations, streets, dimensions, and more, which are described in this chapter as features of a city, when in fact they are features of the church and so must be interpreted not materially, but spiritually. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 902</h4><p>902. [verse 14] 'And the wall of the city having twelve foundations' signifies that the Word in the sense of the letter contains all the things of the doctrine of the New Church. By 'the wall of the city' is signified the Word in the sense of the letter (<a href="898.htm">898</a>); and by 'twelve foundations' are signified all the things of the doctrine of the Church. By 'foundations' are signified doctrinal tenets, and by 'twelve' all. The Church also is founded upon the doctrine, for it teaches how we are to believe and how we are to live, and the doctrine is to be drawn from no other source than the Word. That it is derived from the sense of the letter of the Word may be seen in <a href="../ss/50.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 50-61</a>. Since all the things of the doctrine are signified by 'the twelve foundations of the wall of the city New Jerusalem,' and the Church is a Church by virtue of the doctrine, therefore its foundations are treated of specifically below (verses 19-20). In the Word 'the foundations of the land' are mentioned several times, and by them are not understood the foundations of the land but the foundations of the Church, for 'the land' signifies the Church (<a href="285.htm">285</a>); and the foundations of the Church are nothing else but the things that are derived from the Word and are called doctrinal tenets. For it is the Word itself that lays the foundations of the Church.</p><p>[2] Doctrinal tenets derived from the Word are also signified by 'foundations' in these passages:<p>Do you not understand the foundations of the land? <a href="3927/isaiah_40_21.htm">Isaiah 40:21</a>.<p>I will put My words in thy mouth, to plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the land. <a href="3927/isaiah_51_16.htm">Isaiah 51:16</a>.<p>They do not acknowledge, neither do they understand, they walk in darkness, all the foundations of the land totter. <a href="3927/psalms_82_5.htm">Psalms 82:5</a>.<p>The Word of Jehovah, Who is stretching out the heavens and laying the foundations of the land and forming man's spirit in the midst of him, <a href="3927/zechariah_12_1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>.<p>Jehovah has kindled a fire in Zion which has devoured the foundations thereof, <a href="3927/lamentations_4_11.htm">Lamentations 4:11</a>.<p>The wicked are shooting in the darkness at the upright in heart, because the foundations are undermined. <a href="3927/psalms_11_2.htm">Psalms 11:2-3</a>.<p>Hear, O mountains, Jehovah's controversy, the strong, O foundations of the land, because Jehovah has a controversy with His people. <a href="3927/micah_6_2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>.<p>The waterfalls are opened from on high, and the foundations of the land are shaken, the land is broken in pieces, the land is broken up, the land is shaken. <a href="3927/isaiah_24_18.htm">Isaiah 24:18-20</a>; besides elsewhere as <a href="3927/isaiah_14_32.htm">Isaiah 14:32</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_48_13.htm">48:13</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_51_13.htm">51:13</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_24_2.htm">Psalms 24:2</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_102_25.htm">102:25</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_102_26.htm">26</a>]; <a href="3927/psalms_104_5.htm">Psalms 104:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/2-samuel_22_8.htm">2 Samuel 22:8</a>, <a href="3927/2-samuel_22_16.htm">16</a>. He who does not think that 'the land' signifies the Church can think only in a purely natural manner, in fact materially, here where he reads 'the foundations of the land.' This is like what it would be if he did not think that 'the city Jerusalem' here signifies the Church, when he reads 'wall,' 'gates,' 'foundations,' 'streets,' its 'measurements' and more things besides that are described in this chapter as 'the city,' when yet they are things of the Church, thus not to be understood materially but spiritually. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 902</h4><p>902. Verse 14. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, signifies that the Word, in the sense of the letter contains all things of the doctrine of the New Church. By "the wall of the city" is signified the Word in the sense of the letter, (<a href="898.htm">898</a>); and by "twelve foundations" are signified all things of the doctrine of the church; by "foundations" are signified doctrinals, and by "twelve" all. The church also is founded upon doctrine, for doctrine teaches how we are to believe, and how we are to live, and doctrine is to be drawn from no other source than the Word; that it is from the sense of the letter of the Word, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, (<a href="50.htm">50-61</a>). Since all things of doctrine are signified by "the twelve foundations of the wall of the city New Jerusalem," and as the church is a church from doctrine, therefore its foundations are particularly treated of below (verses <a href="3927/revelation_18_19.htm">19-20</a>). In the Word "foundations of the earth" are sometimes named, and by them are not meant the foundations of the earth, but the foundations of the church, for "the earth" signifies the church, (<a href="285.htm">285</a>), and the foundations of the church are no other than what are from the Word, and are called doctrinals; for it is the Word itself which founds the church.</p><p>[2] Doctrinals from the Word are also signified by "foundations" in the following passages:<p>Do ye not understand the foundations of the earth? (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_21.htm">Isaiah 40:21</a>)<p>I will put my words into thy mouth, to plant the heavens and to found the earth, (<a href="3927/isaiah_51_16.htm">Isaiah 51:16</a>).<p>They do not acknowledge, they do not understand, they walk in darkness, all the foundations of the earth totter, (<a href="3927/psalms_82_5.htm">Psalms 82:5</a>).<p>The Word of Jehovah stretcheth forth the heavens and foundeth the earth, and formeth the spirit of man in the midst of him, (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>).<p>Jehovah hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof, (<a href="3927/lamentations_4_11.htm">Lamentations 4:11</a>).<p>The wicked shoot in darkness at the upright in heart, because the foundations are undermined, (<a href="3927/psalms_11_2.htm">Psalms 11:2-3</a>).<p>Hear ye, O mountains, the controversy of Jehovah, the strength, the foundations of the earth, for Jehovah hath a controversy with His people, (<a href="3927/micah_6_2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>).<p>The cataracts from on high were opened, and the foundations of the earth were shaken, the earth is broken in pieces, the earth is rent, the earth is moved, (<a href="3927/isaiah_24_18.htm">Isaiah 24:18-20</a> Besides other places (as <a href="3927/isaiah_14_32.htm">Isaiah 14:32</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_48_13.htm">48:13</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_51_13.htm">51:13</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_24_2.htm">Psalms 24:2</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_102_25.htm">102:25</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_104_5.htm">104:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/2-samuel_22_8.htm">2 Samuel 22:8</a>, <a href="3927/2-samuel_22_16.htm">16</a>). He who does not think that "the earth" signifies the church, can think no otherwise here than merely naturally, yea materially, when he reads of "the foundations of the earth;" the same as it would be, if he did not think that the city Jerusalem here signifies the church, while he reads of its wall, gates, foundations, streets, measures, and other particulars, which are described in this chapter as relating to a city; when yet they relate to the church, and thus are not to be understood materially, but spiritually. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 902 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>902. (Vers. 14.) "Et murus urbis habens fundamenta duodecim," significat quod Verbum in Sensu literae contineat omnia doctrinae Novae Ecclesiae. -Per "murum urbis" significatur Verbum in Sensu literae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_902/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_898" target=_top>898</a>); et per "fundamenta duodecim" significantur omnia doctrinae Ecclesiae, per "fundamenta" significantur doctrinalia, et per "duodecim" omnia; etiam Ecclesia fundatur super doctrina, docet enim quomodo credendum est et quomodo vivendum, et doctrina non aliunde quam ex Verbo haurienda est; quod ex Sensu literae Verbi, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_902/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_50" target=_top>Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 50-61</a>. Quoniam omnia doctrinae per "duodecim fundamenta muri urbis Novae Hierosolymae" significantur, et Ecclesia est Ecclesia ex doctrina, ideo de fundamentis ejus in specie agitur infra (vers. 19, 20). In Verbo aliquoties nominantur "fundamenta terrae;" et per illa non intelliguntur fundamenta terrae, sed fundamenta Ecclesiae, "terra" enim significat Ecclesiam (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_902/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_285" target=_top>285</a>); et fundamenta Ecclesiae non alia sunt, quam quae ex Verbo sunt, et vocantur doctrinalia; ipsum enim Verbum est quod fundat Ecclesiam.
