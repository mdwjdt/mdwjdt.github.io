<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第111节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>111.“你还坚守我的名，没有弃绝我的信仰”表他们还拥有宗教信仰和照此的敬拜，也承认圣言是神性真理。耶和华或主之“名”是指祂借以受到敬拜的全部，因而是指宗教信仰的全部（参看<a href="81.htm">81</a>节）。故此处它表示这些人拥有宗教信仰和照此的敬拜。“信仰”在此不是指当今教会所存之信，而是指神性真理，因为信属乎真理，真理属乎信。在天堂，“信仰”不是指别的，圣言所说“神的信”也不是指别的。正因如此，在希伯来语，“信仰”和“真理”是同一个字，叫做“Amuna”。由于“神的信”既指神性真理，而圣言又是神性真理本身，故很明显，“没有弃绝我的信仰”表示他们承认圣言是神性真理。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 111</h4><p>111. "'And you hold fast My name, and did not deny My faith.'" This symbolically means, even though they have religion and worship in accordance with it, and moreover acknowledge the Word as being Divine truth.<p>The name of Jehovah or of the Lord means everything by which He is worshiped, thus everything connected with religion, as may be seen in no. <a href="81.htm">81</a> above. Therefore it means here that they have religion and worship in accordance with it.<p>Faith in this instance does not mean faith as faith is defined in the church today, but rather Divine truth, since faith is connected with truth and truth with faith. It is precisely what is meant by faith in heaven, and by the faith of God in the Word. It is because of this that faith and truth in Hebrew are the same word and are called 'emuna.<p>Now because the faith of God means Divine truth, and the Word is Divine truth itself, it is apparent that "you did not deny My faith" means that they acknowledge the Word to be Divine truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 111</h4><p>111. 'And thou holdest fast My Name, and hast not denied My faith' signifies when yet they have religion, and worship in accordance therewith, and they also acknowledge the Word as being the Divine Truth (veritas). That by the 'Name' of Jehovah or the Lord is understood everything by means of which He is worshipped, thus everything of religion, may be seen above (<a href="81.htm">81</a>). Here therefore it signifies that these have religion, and in accordance with religion, worship. Since faith is of truth and truth is of faith, by 'faith' here is not understood a faith after the fashion of the faith at present in the Church, but the Divine Truth (veritas). Nothing else is understood in heaven by 'faith,' nor anything else by 'the faith of God' in the Word. Consequently in the Hebrew language faith and truth (veritas) are one word, and are termed Amuna. Now because by 'the faith of God' is understood the Divine Truth (veritas), and the Word is Divine Truth Itself, it is plain that by 'thou hast not denied My faith' is understood that they acknowledge that the Word is the Divine Truth (veritas). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 111</h4><p>111. And thou holdest fast My name, and hast not denied My faith, signifies when yet they have religion and worship according to it, and also acknowledge the Word to be the Divine truth. That by the "name" of Jehovah, or of the Lord is meant all by which He is worshiped, thus the all of religion, may be (<a href="81.htm">81</a>[1-4]) seen above; here therefore it signifies that they have religion, and, according to religion, worship. By "faith," here is not meant that which exists in the church at this day, but the Divine truth, because faith is of truth and truth is of faith; nothing else is meant by "faith" in heaven, nor by the "faith of God" in the Word; hence it is that faith and truth are expressed in the Hebrew language by one and the same word, and are called Amuna. Since then by "the faith of God" is meant the Divine truth, and the Word is Divine truth itself, it is evident that by "thou hast not denied My faith," is meant, that they acknowledge that the Word is the Divine truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 111 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>111. "Et tenes Nomen Meum, et non negasti fidem Meam," significat cum tamen illis est religio, et secundum illam cultus, et quoque agnoscunt Verbum quod sit Divina Veritas. - Quod per "Nomen" Jehovae seu Domini intelligatur omne per quod colitur, ita omne religionis, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_111/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_81" target=_top>81</a>); hic itaque quod illis religio sit, et secundum religionem cultus: per "fidem" hic non intelligitur fides quemadmodum fides hodie in Ecclesia, sed Divina veritas, quoniam fides est veri et verum est fidei; non aliud intelligitur per "fidem" in Caelo, nec aliud per "fidem Dei" in Verbo; inde est quod fides et veritas in Lingua Hebraea sint una vox, et dicantur "Amuna:" nunc quia per "fidem Dei" intelligitur Divina Veritas, et Verbum est Ipsum Divinum Verum, patet quod per "non negasti fidem Meam" intelligatur quod agnoscant quod Verbum sit Divina Veritas. </p>
