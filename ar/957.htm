<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第957节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>957.启22:18.“我向一切听见这书上预言之话的作见证，若有人在这些事上加添什么，神必将写在这书上的灾祸加在他身上”表那些阅读并知道主如今所打开这本书的教义真理，却依旧认别神超过主，认别信超过对祂的信之人若添加了什么导致这二者被毁，必因本书描述的灾所表示的虚假与邪恶而灭亡。“听见这书上预言之话”表示阅读并知道主如今所打开这本书的教义真理（参看<a href="944.htm">944</a>节）；稍后会看到，“加添什么”表示添加什么导致这些真理被毁；“写在这书上的灾祸”表示写在这书上的“灾”（<a href="15.htm">15</a>、<a href="16.htm">16</a>章论到这些灾）所表示的虚假与邪恶。“灾”表示那些敬拜龙之兽与假先知的人所持有的虚假与邪恶（参看<a href="456.htm">456</a>，<a href="657.htm">657</a>，<a href="673.htm">673</a>，<a href="676.htm">676</a>-677，<a href="683.htm">683</a>，<a href="690.htm">690</a>-691，<a href="699.htm">699</a>，<a href="708.htm">708</a>，<a href="718.htm">718</a>节）；龙之兽和假先知是指那些声称唯信得救，无需好行为的人。</p><p>这本预言书的所有内容都指向两大原则；其一，除了主以外，不可承认其它任何神；其二，除了对主之信外，不可承认其它任何信；凡知道这些，却又添加什么，企图毁灭它们的人，必陷入虚假与邪恶，也必因它们而灭亡，因为属于爱的良善和属于信的真理，因而永生的幸福只从主，而非其它神，并且只凭对主之信，而非其它信被赐予，正如主在福音书中多处所教导的（参看<a href="553.htm">553</a>节）。</p><p>谁都能凭自己的判断看出，所表示是这一点，不是神会把启示录15和16章所描述的灾加到在这书的预言之话上添加什么的人身上。由于不知道表示什么，所以做这种事的，有可能是一个无辜之人，许多人也可能是心怀好意。因为迄今为止，启示录一直是一本被封闭，或神秘的书；所以谁都能看出，这句话的意思是，不可添加或拿走什么来毁灭主如今所打开这本书中的教义真理；这些真理全都关系到这两大原则；也正因如此，下面这些话以一个系列随着前面那些话而来：“耶稣差遣祂的使者在众教会将这些事向你们证明。我是大卫的根和后裔，是明亮的晨星。圣灵和新妇都说，来！听见的人也该说，来！口渴的人也当来；愿意的，都可以白白取生命的水”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.16.htm">22:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.17.htm">17</a>）。这些话表示主将以其神性人身到来，并赐永生给那些承认祂的人；所以，下面这些话同样以一个系列随后而来：“证明这些事的说，是了，我必快来！阿们！主耶稣啊，愿你来”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.20.htm">22:20</a>）；由此明显可知，所表示的并非别的什么。“加添”也是一个预言的词，表示毁灭或摧毁（如诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗120.2.htm">120:2</a>等）。这一切以及下一节的含义从这些内容可以看出来。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 957</h4><p>957. <a href="3927/revelation_22_18.htm">22:18</a> For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add upon him the plagues that are written in this book. This symbolically means that people who read and know the doctrinal truths in this book now laid open by the Lord, and yet acknowledge some other God than the Lord, and some other faith than faith in the Lord, by adding something which destroys these two tenets, cannot but perish as a result of the falsities and evils symbolized by the plagues described in this book.<p>To hear the words of the prophecy of this book means, symbolically, to read and know the doctrinal truths in this book now laid open by the Lord, as may be seen in no. <a href="944.htm">944</a> above. To add to these things means, symbolically, adding something in order to destroy those truths, as will be seen below. The plagues that are written in this book symbolize the falsities and evils that are symbolically meant by the plagues described in this book, which we dealt with in chapters <a href="3927/revelation_15_1.htm">15</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_16_1.htm">16</a>. The plagues symbolize the falsities and evils entertained by people who worship the dragon's beast and the false prophet. See nos. <a href="456.htm">456</a>, <a href="657.htm">657</a>, <a href="673.htm">673</a>, <a href="676.htm">676</a>, <a href="677.htm">677</a>, <a href="683.htm">683</a>, <a href="690.htm">690</a>, <a href="691.htm">691</a>, <a href="699.htm">699</a>, <a href="708.htm">708</a>, <a href="718.htm">718</a>. The dragon's beast and the false prophet are people who make faith alone saving without good works.</p><p>[2] There are two principal points in this prophetic book to which all the others in it have relation: The first is that no other God than the Lord is to be acknowledged; and the second, that no other faith than faith in the Lord is to be acknowledged. Someone who knows this, and yet adds something with the intention of destroying these two points, cannot help but be caught up in falsities and evils and perish on account of them, since from no other God than the Lord, and through no other faith than faith in the Lord, is good possible that is a matter of love, and truth that is a matter of faith, and in consequence of these the felicity of eternal life, as the Lord Himself teaches in many places in the Gospels. See no. <a href="553.htm">553</a> above.</p><p>[3] This is what is symbolically meant, and not that God will add the plagues described in chapters <a href="3927/revelation_15_1.htm">15</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_16_1.htm">16</a> upon a person who adds something to the words of the prophecy of this book, as anyone can see in the light of his own ability to judge. For a person may add something innocently, and many also may do so for a good purpose, and in ignorance of what is symbolically meant. The book of Revelation, indeed, has so far been like a closed book or a mystical one. Anyone can see, therefore, that the meaning is that one is not to add or take away something that destroys the doctrinal truths in this book now laid open by the Lord, truths which have relation to the above two principal points. Therefore the declaration here also follows in this prior one in the series:<p>"I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star." And the spirit and the bride say, "Come!" And let him who hears say, "Come!" And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely. (<a href="3927/revelation_22_16.htm">Revelation 22:16-17</a>)<p>It symbolically means that the Lord will come in His Divine humanity and grant eternal life to people who acknowledge Him. Consequently the declaration here is also followed in the series by this one:<p>He who testifies to these things says, "Surely I am coming quickly." Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus!" (<a href="3927/revelation_22_20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>)<p>It is apparent from this that there is no other meaning.<p>To add is also a prophetic term symbolically meaning to destroy, as in <a href="3927/psalms_120_3.htm">Psalms 120:3</a> and elsewhere.<p>It can now be seen from this what is symbolically meant by the declaration in this verse and the one in the next. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 957</h4><p>957. [verse 18] 'For I call to witness all those hearing the words of the prophecy of this book, if anyone adds to these things, God shall add upon him the plagues written in this book' signifies that those who read and know the truths of the doctrine of this book now opened by the Lord, and go on acknowledging a God other than the Lord and a faith other than one directed to Him by adding something by means of which these two may be destroyed, cannot do otherwise than perish on account of the untruths and evils that are signified by the plagues described in this book. By 'to hear the words of the prophecy of this book' is signified to read and know the truths of the doctrine of this book now opened by the Lord, as may be seen above (<a href="944.htm">944</a>). By 'to add to these things' is signified by adding something by means of which those truths may be destroyed, as it follows on. By 'the plagues written in this book' are signified the evils and untruths that are signified by the plagues described in this book (treated of in chapter <a href="3927/revelation_15_1.htm">15</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_16_1.htm">16</a>). That 'the plagues' signify the untruths and evils that those have who adore the dragon's beast and the false prophet may be seen (<a href="456.htm">456</a>, <a href="657.htm">657</a>, <a href="673.htm">673</a>, <a href="676.htm">676-677</a>, <a href="683.htm">683</a>, <a href="690.htm">690-691</a>, <a href="699.htm">699</a>, <a href="708.htm">708</a>, <a href="718.htm">718</a>). 'The dragons beast' and 'the false prophet' are those who make faith alone saving without good works.</p><p>[2] There are two things in this prophetical book to which all the things thereof have relation. The first is that no other God is to be acknowledged but the Lord, and the second that no other faith is to be acknowledged but one directed to the Lord. He who knows these, and yet adds something with the intention of destroying them, cannot be otherwise than in untruths and evils, and perish on account of them, since the good that is of love, and the truth that is of faith, and consequently the happiness of eternal life, is not given by derivation from any other God than the Lord nor by means of any other faith than one directed to the Lord, as the Lord Himself teaches in many places in the Evangelists as may be seen above (<a href="553.htm">553</a>).</p><p>[3] That this is signified, and not that God is going to add the plagues described (chapters <a href="3927/revelation_15_1.htm">15</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_16_1.htm">16</a>) upon him who adds anything to the words of the prophecy of this book, anyone can see from his own judgment. For an innocent person can do this, and also many can do so from a good end, as also on account of not knowing what is signified. For up to this time the Apocalypse has been a closed or mystic book; and therefore anyone can see that it is understood that not a thing is to be added or taken away which destroys the truths of the doctrine in this book now opened by the Lord; which truths all have relation to those two things. For this reason also these words in the series follow after these:<p>Jesus sent His angel to testify unto you these things in the Churches, I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright and the morning Star: and the spirit and the bride are saying, Come, and let the one hearing say, Come, and let the thirsting one come, and let the willing one take the water of life freely (verses 16-17); by which is signified that the Lord in His Own Divine Human is going to come, and is going to give eternal life to those who acknowledge Him; and therefore also in the series these words follow:<p>The One testifying these things says, Indeed I am coming quickly, Amen. Come indeed, Lord Jesus (verse 20); from which it is plain that no other things are understood. Also 'to add' is a prophetical word signifying to destroy, as in <a href="3927/psalms_120_3.htm">Psalms 120:3</a>, and elsewhere. From these considerations it can now be seen what is signified by the things that are in this verse, and by the things in the one following. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 957</h4><p>957. Verse 18. For I testify unto everyone that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if anyone shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book, signifies that they who read and know the truths of doctrine of this book, now opened by the Lord, and yet acknowledge any other God than the Lord, and any other faith than in Him, by adding anything whereby they may destroy these two things, cannot do otherwise than perish from the falsities and evils, which are signified by the plagues described in this book. "To hear the words of the prophecy of this book" signifies to read and know the truths of doctrine of this book, now opened by the Lord, see above, (<a href="944.htm">944</a>); by "adding to them" is signified to add anything whereby they may destroy those truths, as will be seen presently; by "the plagues written in this book," are signified the falsities and evils which are signified by "the plagues written in this book" (of which chapters 15-16).<p>That "plagues" signify the falsities and evils which those have who adore the beast of the dragon, and the false prophet, may be seen, (<a href="456.htm">456</a>, <a href="657.htm">657</a>, <a href="673.htm">673</a>, <a href="676.htm">676-677</a>, <a href="683.htm">683</a>, <a href="690.htm">690-691</a>, <a href="699.htm">699</a>, <a href="708.htm">708</a>, <a href="718.htm">718</a>); the beast of the dragon, and the false prophet are they who make faith alone without good works saving.</p><p>[2] There are two things in this prophetic book, to which all its contents refer; the first is, that no other God is to be acknowledged but the Lord, and the other, that no other faith is to be acknowledged but faith in the Lord; he who knows these, and yet adds anything with intent to destroy them, cannot be otherwise than in falsities and evils, and must perish from them, because from no other God but the Lord, and by no other faith but faith in the Lord, is given the good which is of love, and the truth which is of faith, and thence the felicity of eternal life, as the Lord Himself teaches in many places in the Evangelists, see above, (<a href="553.htm">553</a>).</p><p>[3] That this is signified, and not that God will add the plagues described in chapters 15, 16 upon him who adds anything to the words of the prophecy of this book, anyone may see from his own judgment. For an innocent person might do this, and many might likewise do it with a good end, and also from ignorance of what is signified; for Revelation has been hitherto like a closed or mystic book, wherefore anyone may see, that the meaning is, that nothing is to be added or taken away, which destroys the truths of doctrine in this book now opened by the Lord, which truths refer to those two; for which reason also, these words follow in a series after "Jesus sent His angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright and morning Star. And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come, and let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that thirsteth come; and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely" (verses <a href="3927/revelation_22_16.htm">16-17</a>). By which is signified, that the Lord will come in His Divine Human, and give eternal life to those who acknowledge Him; wherefore these words follow likewise in a series: "He which testifieth these things, saith, Surely, I come quickly. Amen. Even so come, Lord Jesus" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_22_20.htm">20</a>); from which it is plain that nothing else is meant. "To add" is also a prophetic word signifying to destroy (as in <a href="3927/psalms_120_2.htm">Psalms 120:2</a>, and in other places). From these things the signification of this and the following verse may be seen. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 957 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>957. (Vers. 18.) "Contestor enim omni audienti verba prophetiae Libri hujus, Si quis addiderit ad haec, addet Deus super illum plagas scriptas in Libro hoc," significat quod qui legunt et sciunt vera doctrinae hujus Libri nunc a Domino aperti, et usque agnoscunt alium Deum quam Dominum, et aliam fidem quam in Ipsum, addendo aliquid per quod duo illa destruant, non possint aliter quam perire ex falsis et malis, qua per plagas in hoc Libro descriptas significantur. -Per "audire verba prophetiae Libri hujus" significatur legere et scire vera doctrinae hujus Libri nunc a Domino aperti, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_944" target=_top>944</a>); per "addere ad haec" significatur addendo aliquid per quod destruant illa vera, ut sequitur; per "plagas scriptas in Libro hoc" significantur falsa et mala, quae per plagas in hoc Libro descriptas significantur (de quibus in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_15_1-8" target=_top>15</a> et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_16_1-21" target=_top>Apocalypsis 16</a>); quod "plagae" significent falsa et mala, quae sunt illis qui adorant Draconis Bestiam et Pseudoprophetam, videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_456" target=_top>456</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_657" target=_top>657</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_673" target=_top>673</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_676" target=_top>676</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_677" target=_top>677</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_683" target=_top>683</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_690" target=_top>690</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_691" target=_top>691</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_699" target=_top>699</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_708" target=_top>708</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_718" target=_top>718</a>; Draconis Bestia et Pseudopropheta sunt qui solam Fidem absque bonis Operibus salvificam faciunt. Sunt duo in hoc Libro prophetico, ad quae omnia ejus se referunt; primum est quod non alius Deus agnoscendus sit quam Dominus, et alterum quod non alia fides agnoscenda sit quam in Dominum; qui haec scit, et usque addit aliquid ex intentione quod destruit illa, non potest aliter quam in falsis et malis esse et ex illis perire, quoniam non ex alio Deo quam ex Domino, nec per aliam fidem quam in Dominum, datur bonum quod est amoris, et verum quod est fidei, et inde felicitas vitae aeternae, ut Ipse Dominus apud Evangelistas multis in locis docet (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_553" target=_top>553</a>). Quod hoc significetur, et non quod Deus additurus plagas, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_15_1-8" target=_top>15</a> et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_16_1-21" target=_top>Apocalypsis 16</a> descriptas) super illum qui addit aliquid ad verba prophetiae Libri hujus, quisque potest ex suo judicio videre; id enim potest innocens facere, et quoque possunt multi ex fine bono, ut et ex ignorantia quid significatur; Apocalypsis enim fuit huc usque sicut Liber occlusus seu mysticus; quare quisque videre potest, quod intelligatur, quod non aliquid addendum sit nec auferendum, quod vera doctrinae in hoc Libro a Domino nunc aperto destruit, quae vera se ad illa duo referunt; quare etiam haec verba in serie sequuntur post haec: Jesus misit Angelum Suum "testari vobis haec in Ecclesiis; Ego sum Radix et Genus Davidis, Stella splendida et matutina; et Spiritus et Sponsa dicunt, Veni; et audiens dicat Veni; et sitiens veniat; ac volens accipiet aquam vitae gratis," (vers. 16, 17); per quae significatur, quod Dominus in Divino Humano Suo venturus sit, et daturus vitam aeternam illis qui Ipsum agnoscunt; quare etiam in serie sequuntur haec, "Dicit Testans haec, Etiam venio cito; amen. Etiam veni Domine Jesu," (vers. 20); ex quibus patet, quod non alia intelligantur. Etiam "addere" est vox prophetica significans destruere (ut <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_957/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_120_3" target=_top>Psalm 120:3</a>; <sup>1</sup>et alibi). Ex his nunc videri potest, quid per illa quae in hoc versu, et quae in sequente sunt, significatur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;3 pro "2" </p>
