<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第159节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>159.“坚固那剩下将近死去的”表好叫属于其敬拜的事物能接受生命，不至于破灭。有必要说明这些事要如何来理解。从外在形式上看，死的敬拜与活的敬拜完全相似。因为持守真理的人所做的事是一样的，他们也聆听布道，领受圣餐，早晚跪下祷告，以及其它敬拜中日常和习惯的事。因此，敬拜已死之人只需学习真理并照之生活，“那剩下将近死去的”就能得到坚固了。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 159</h4><p>159. "'And strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die.'" This symbolically means, so that the things of which their worship consists may be given life and not be extinguished.<p>How this is to be interpreted we will explain as follows: In outward form lifeless worship is altogether like living worship, for people governed by truths do the same things. They listen to sermons, partake of the Holy Supper, pray upon their knees morning and evening, and do everything else that is a customary and normal expression of worship. Consequently people engaged in a lifeless worship have need of nothing more than to learn truths and live according to them. In so doing they "strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 159</h4><p>159. 'And strengthen the things remaining that are ready to die' signifies so that the things that pertain to their worship may accept life, and not be extinguished. How these things are to be understood shall be stated. Dead worship is in external form absolutely like living worship, for those who are in truths do similar things, for they listen to sermons, go to the Holy Supper, say prayers kneeling morning and evening, besides the rest of the things of worship that are general and customary. Those, therefore, who are in dead worship have need of no more than to learn truths (veritas) and live them. In this way are 'strengthened the things remaining that are ready to die. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 159</h4><p>159. And strengthen the remaining things which are about to die, signifies, that the things which pertain to their worship may receive life, and not be extinguished. How these things are to be understood shall be stated. Dead worship is altogether similar to living worship in its external form, because they who are in truths do the same things, for they hear preachings, go to the Holy Supper, pray on their knees morning and evening, besides other things which are common and customary in worship; therefore they who are in dead worship, have need of nothing more than to learn truths and live according to them; so that "the remaining things which are ready to die" may be confirmed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 159 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>159. "Et confirma reliqua quae moritura," significat ut illa quae cultus eorum sunt, vitam accipiant, et non exstinguantur. Quomodo haec intelligenda sunt, dicetur: Cultus mortuus est prorsus similis cultui vivo in externa forma, nam similia faciunt qui in veris sunt; audiunt enim praedicationes, obeunt Sacram Caenam, precantur super genubus mane et vesperi, praeter reliqua quae sunt communia et solennia cultus; quare non plus opus est illis qui in cultu mortuo sunt, quam ut discant veritates et vivant illas; ita confirmantur "reliqua quae moritura sunt." </p>
