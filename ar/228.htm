<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>228.“立刻，我在灵里”表他进入属灵的状态，在此状态下，存在于天堂中的事物清楚显现出来。“在灵里”是指通过神性流注进入属灵的状态，至于何为属灵的状态及其性质，人在此状态下能清楚看到灵界事物，如同他在肉体的属世状态下看到尘世事物那样，可见上文（<a href="36.htm">36</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 228</h4><p>228. Immediately I was in the spirit. This symbolizes John's conveyance into a spiritual state, in which the things that occur in heaven clearly appear.<p>It may be seen in no. <a href="36.htm">36</a> above that to be in the spirit is to be conveyed into a spiritual state by a Divine influx. It may be seen there also what a spiritual state is, the nature of it, and the fact that a person in that state sees the phenomena in the spiritual world as clearly as he sees the phenomena in this world when in the natural state of the body. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 228</h4><p>228. [verse 2] 'And immediately I came to be in the spirit' signifies that he was admitted into a spiritual state, in which the things that come into existence in heaven are clearly visible. At <a href="36.htm">36</a> above it may be seen that 'to come to be in the spirit' is to be admitted into a spiritual state as a result of a Divine influx, also what the spiritual state is, and the quality thereof, and that in that state a man sees the things that are in the spiritual world as clearly as in the natural state of the body he sees the things that are of this world. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 228</h4><p>228. Verse 2. And immediately I was in the spirit, signifies that he was let into a spiritual state, in which the things which exist in heaven manifestly appear. That "to be in the spirit" is to be let into a spiritual state from Divine influx, as also what a spiritual state is and its quality, and that a man in that state sees as manifestly the things which are in the spiritual world, as in the natural state of the body he sees the things which are in this world, may be seen above, (<a href="36.htm">36</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 228 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>228. (Vers. 2.) "Et statim factus sum in spiritu," significat quod immissus sit in statum spiritualem, in quo manifeste apparent illa quae in Caelo existunt. - Quod "fieri in spiritu" sit immitti in statum spiritualem ex influxu Divino, tum quid status spiritualis, et qualis ille, et quod homo in eo statutam manifeste videat quae in mundo spirituali sunt, sicut in statu naturali corporis videt illa quae in hoc mundo sunt, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_228/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_36" target=_top>36</a>). </p>
