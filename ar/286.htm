<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第286节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>286.“我又看见，且听见宝座与活物并长老的周围，有许多天使的声音”表低层天堂的天使对主的称谢和颂赞。对主的称谢和颂赞出于三层天堂的天使（参看<a href="275.htm">275</a>节）；先是出于高层天堂天使的（8-10节）；故现在轮到低层天堂的天使（11-12节）。因此，“宝座周围天使的声音”表示低层天堂的天使对主的称谢和颂赞。那时，约翰还看见活物与长老同他们在一起，因为“活物”和“长老”表示高层天堂的天使（<a href="275.htm">275</a>节），低层天堂从不与高层天堂分开行动，而是与它们结合。因为主从祂自己直接流入所有天堂，因而也流入低层天堂，同时间接经由高层天堂流入低层天堂。这是为何约翰首先看见并听见独自的四活物和长老，然后看见同他们一起的那些低层天使的原因。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 286</h4><p>286. Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders. (<a href="3927/revelation_5_11.htm">5:11</a>) This symbolizes a confession and glorification of the Lord by angels of the lower heavens.<p>It may be seen in no. <a href="275.htm">275</a> above that a confession and glorification of the Lord was made by angels of the three heavens - by angels of the higher heavens in verses <a href="3927/revelation_5_8.htm">8</a> to 10, and so now by angels of the lower heavens in verses 11, 12. Thus the voice of the angels around the throne means a confession and glorification of the Lord by angels of the lower heavens.<p>John also saw then the living creatures and the elders along with the angels, because the living creatures and elders symbolize angels of the higher heavens (no. <a href="275.htm">275</a>), and the lower heavens never act independently of the higher heavens, but conjointly with them. For the Lord flows in directly from Himself into all the heavens, thus also into the lower ones, but at the same time indirectly through the higher heavens into the lower ones.<p>This then is the reason that John first saw and heard the living creatures and elders by themselves, and afterward together with the angels. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 286</h4><p>286. [verse is] 'And I saw and heard the voice of many angels around the throne, and the animals, and the elders' signifies a confession and glorification of the Lord by the angels of the lower heavens. That a confession and glorification of the Lord was made by the angels of the three heavens may be seen above (<a href="275.htm">275</a>); and that [one was made] by the angels of the higher heavens (from verses 8-10); and consequently now by the angels of the lower heavens (verses 11-12). Therefore by 'the voice of angels around the throne' is understood a confession and glorification of the Lord by the angels of the lower heavens. He then also saw 'the animals and the elders' together with those [angels], because by 'the animals and the elders' the angels of the higher heavens are signified (<a href="275.htm">275</a>), and the lower heavens never act separately from the higher heavens, but conjointly with them. For the Lord inflows out of Himself, without mediation, into all the heavens, thus also into the lower ones, and at the same time He inflows mediately through the higher heavens into the lower ones. This therefore is the reason why he 'saw and heard the animals and the elders' first by themselves, and then together with those [lower angels]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 286</h4><p>286. Verse 11. And I saw, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the animals and the elders, signifies confession and glorification of the Lord by the angels of the lower heavens. That there was confession and glorification of the Lord by the angels of the three heavens, may be seen above, (<a href="275.htm">275</a>); and by the angels of the higher heavens, (from verses 8-10); and therefore now by the angels of the lower heavens (verses <a href="3927/revelation_5_11.htm">11-12</a>); wherefore by "the voice of the angels round about the throne," is meant the confession and glorification of the Lord by the angels of the lower heavens. That he then saw also the animals and elders together with them, because by "the animals" and "elders" are signified the angels of the higher heavens, (<a href="275.htm">275</a>), and the lower heavens never act separately from the higher heavens, but in conjunction with them; for the Lord inflows into all the heavens immediately from Himself; thus also into the lower heavens; and at the same time mediately through the higher heavens into the lower. This is the reason, therefore, why "he saw and heard the animals and elders" first by themselves, and afterwards in conjunction with the others. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 286 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>286. (Vers. 11) "Et vidi et audivi vocem Angelorum multorum circum Thronum, et Animalia et Seniores," significat confessionem et glorificationem Domini ab Angelis Inferiorum Caelorum. - Quod confessio et glorificatio Domini facta sit ab Angelis trium caelorum, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_286/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_275" target=_top>275</a>); et quod ab Angelis superiorum Caelorum (a vers. 8 ad 10); et inde nunc ab Angelis inferiorum Caelorum (vers. 11, 12); quare per "vocem Angelorum circum Thronum" intelligitur confessio et glorificatio Domini ab Angelis inferiorum Caelorum. Quod etiam tunc viderit Animalia et Seniores simul cum illis, est quia per "Animalia" et "Seniores" significantur Angeli superiorum Caelorum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_286/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_275" target=_top>275</a>), ac inferiores Caeli nusquam separatim a superioribus Caelis agunt, sed conjunctim cum illis; influit enim Dominus immediate ex Se in omnes Caelos, ita quoque in inferiores, et simul mediate per Caelos superiores in inferiores. Haec itaque causa est, quod "viderit et audiverit Animalia et Seniores" primum per se, et dein una cum illis. </p>
