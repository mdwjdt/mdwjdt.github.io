<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>116.“所以你当悔改”表他们要警惕这类行为，践行良善的行为。这些事之所以由“悔改”来表示，是因为此处论述的是邀功和虚伪的良善，而这类良善正是那些将教会的一切放在善行，丝毫不放在教义真理上的人所要警惕的。因为教义的真理能指示我们当如何意愿，如何思想，也就是当爱什么，信什么，从而使得行为是良善的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 116</h4><p>116. "'Repent.'" (<a href="3927/revelation_2_16.htm">2:16</a>) This symbolically means that they should guard themselves against such works, and do works that are good.<p>To repent has this symbolic meaning, because the subject has just been goods that are merit-seeking and hypocritical, and these must be guarded against by people who place everything having to do with the church and salvation in good works, and not anything in doctrinal truths, even though it is doctrinal truths that must teach how and what one ought to will and think, or love and believe, in order for works to be good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 116</h4><p>116. [verse 16] 'Repent' signifies so that they may be on their guard against such works, and do works that are good. These things are signified by 'repenting,' because it has treated of goods for the sake of recompense, and of hypocritical goods, against which those who place everything of the Church and of salvation in good works and not anything in truths of doctrine will be on their guard; when yet truths of doctrine teach how and of what there must be a willing and thinking, or loving and believing, in order that the works may be good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 116</h4><p>116. Verse 16. Repent, signifies that they should guard themselves against such works, and do works which are good. That these things are signified by "repent," is, because it now treats of meritorious and hypocritical goods, against which they should guard themselves who place the all of the church and of salvation in good works, and not anything in the truths of doctrine; when yet the truths of doctrine teach how and what is to be willed and thought, or loved and believed, that the works may be good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 116 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>116. (Vers. 26.) "Resipisce," significat ut caveant sibi ab illis operibus, et faciant opera quae bona sunt. - Quod haec significentur per "resipiscere," est quia de bonis meritoriis et hypocriticis nunc actum est, a quibus sibi cavebunt illi qui omne Ecclesiae et salutis in bonis operibus, et non aliquid in veris doctrinae ponunt; cum tamen vera doctrinae docent, quomodo et quid volendum et cogitandum, seu amandum et credendum est, ut opera sint bona. </p>
