<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>457.“仍旧不悔改自己手所做的”表他们也不避开自己的事物，也就是各种如罪的邪恶。“人手所做的”表示人自己的事物，也就是邪恶和由此而来的虚假，因为“手”表示从人所发出的作为总体的这些事物；事实上，心智、因而其身体的能力都指向手，并终止于手；因此，在圣言中，“手”表示能力；所以，“人手所做的”表示人自己的事物，就是各种邪恶与虚假；在其意愿中的自己的事物就是邪恶，在其认知或理解力中的自己的事物则由此而来的虚假。论到此处所论述的这些人，可以说他们不悔改；原因在于，凡使唯信成为宗教信仰的全部之人都会在心里说：“既然凭唯信罪就得赦免，我们也能得救，那么还有悔改的必要吗？在这种事上，我们自己的行为又有什么用呢？我知道自己生在罪中，是个罪人；只要我承认这一点，祈求我的过错不要归给我，悔改的行为不就算完成了吗？还有必要再做什么吗？”于是，他根本不思想关于罪的事，最终不知道还有罪这回事；因此，他不断因罪所流出的快乐和愉悦而在罪里面悠哉悠哉，沉溺于其中，就像船只被风和潮水推向礁石，而船长和船员却都睡着了。</p><p>就圣言的属世之义而言，“人手所做的”是指雕像、铸像和偶像；但就属灵之义而言，则表示各种邪恶与虚假，也就是人自己的事物；如以下经文：</p><p>不可以你们手所做的惹我发怒；你们竟以手所做的惹我发怒，自招祸患。我也必照他们的行为，按他们手所做的报应他们。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 25.6.htm"> 25:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 25.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 25.14.htm">14</a>）</p><p>以色列人尽以手所做的惹我发怒。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.30.htm">32:30</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶44.8.htm">44:8</a>）</p><p>至于他们的一切恶，就是跪拜自己手所造的，我要向他们宣读判决。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶1.16.htm">1:16</a>）</p><p>当那日，眼目重看以色列的圣者，必不仰望祭坛，就是他们手所筑的，也不重看他们指头所造的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛17.7.htm">17:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛17.8.htm">8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.7.htm">31:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.19.htm">37:19</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.9.htm">10:9</a>）。</p><p>“人手所做的”是指他的统我，邪恶和由此而来的虚假。这一点从以下事实很明显地看出来：由于这个原因，以色列人被禁止用凿过的石头建祭坛和圣殿，不可在这些石头上使用铁器；因为这表示“人手所做的”。</p><p>你若为我筑一座石坛，不可用凿过的来建筑；因你在上头一动刀凿，就把坛污秽了。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出20.25.htm">20:25</a>）</p><p>约书亚筑一座石坛，是用没有动过铁器的石头筑的。（约书亚心8:30，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书8.31.htm">31</a>）</p><p>耶路撒冷的圣殿是用整块石头建的，建殿的时候，锤子、斧子和任何铁器的响声都没有听见。（列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.7.htm">6:7</a>）</p><p>主所做的一切事物也被称为“祂手所做的”（或“祂手所行的”，“祂手的工作”），这些事物都是祂自己的，本身是良善与真理；如以下经文：</p><p>耶和华手所行的是诚实公平。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗111.7.htm">111:7</a>）</p><p>耶和华啊，你的慈爱永远长存；求你不要离弃你手所作的。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗138.8.htm">138:8</a>）</p><p>耶和华以色列的圣者，就是造就以色列的如此说，关于我的众子，你们可以来问我将来的事，关于我手所作的，你们可以吩咐我。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.11.htm">45:11</a>）</p><p>你的人民都必成为义人，是我种的栽子、我手的工作。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.21.htm">60:21</a>）</p><p>耶和华啊，现在你仍是我们的父，我们是泥，你是我们的窑匠；我们都是你手的工作。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛64.8.htm">64:8</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 457</h4><p>457. Still did not repent of the works of their hands. This symbolically means, nor did they refrain from their native proclivities, which are evils of every kind, as being sins.<p>The works of a person's hands symbolize a person's native proclivities, which are evils and their attendant falsities, because the hands symbolize in summary the things that emanate from a person; for the forces of the mind and consequently of the body are directed into the hands and terminate there. Consequently the hands in the Word symbolize power. For the same reason the works of a person's hands symbolize his native proclivities, which are evils and falsities of every kind. Evils are the native proclivities of his will, and the attendant falsities the native proclivities of his intellect.<p>We are told regarding the people who are the subject here that they did not repent, because people who make faith alone the totality of religion say to themselves, "What need do I have of repentance, when through faith alone our sins are forgiven and we are saved? What do our works contribute to this? I know that I was born in sin and that I am a sinner. If I confess this and pray that my faults not be imputed to me, then I have repented. What need do I have of anything more?"<p>Thus the person then gives no thought to sin, even to the point of not knowing what sins are. Consequently the delight and gratification they afford continually carry him along in them and into them, the way a favorable wind and current carry a ship onto rocks when both captain and crew are asleep.</p><p>[2] In the natural sense of the Word, the works of a person's hands mean carved images, cast images, and idols; but in its spiritual sense, they symbolize evils and falsities of every kind, which are a person's native proclivities. As, for example, in the following passages:<p>...do not provoke Me to anger by the work of your hands...; (if you were) to provoke Me to anger by the work of your hands to your own hurt..., I will repay them according to their work and according to the deeds of their hands. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_25_6.htm">Jeremiah 25:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">14</a>)<p>...the children of Israel have provoked Me... to anger by the work of their hands... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_32_30.htm">Jeremiah 32:30</a>, cf. <a href="3927/jeremiah_44_8.htm">44:8</a>)<p>I will utter My judgments against them concerning all their wickedness, because they... bowed themselves to the works of their hands. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_1_16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>)<p>In that day... people's eyes will look to the Holy One of Israel, and... not to the altars, the work of their hands, and... what their fingers have made... (<a href="3927/isaiah_17_7.htm">Isaiah 17:7-8</a>, cf. <a href="3927/isaiah_31_7.htm">31:7</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_37_19.htm">37:19</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a>)</p><p>[3] The work of a person's hands is his own doing, thus evil and falsity, and this can be clearly seen from the fact that it was for this reason that the Israelites were forbidden to built an altar or temple out of hewn stones, or to use an iron tool on those stones; for they symbolized the work of a person's hands:<p>If you make Me an altar of stones, you shall not build it of hewn stones; for if you use your chisel on it, you will profane it. (<a href="3927/exodus_20_25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>)<p>Joshua built... an altar of... stones, on which he did not use an iron tool. (<a href="3927/joshua_8_30.htm">Joshua 8:30-31</a>)<p>The temple (at Jerusalem)...was built of whole stone, and no hammer or axe or any iron tool was heard... while it was being built. (<a href="3927/1-kings_6_7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a>)</p><p>[4] Everything that the Lord does is likewise called the work of His hands, and these are His inherent attributes, which in themselves are goods and truths. As, for example, in the following places:<p>The works of (Jehovah's) hands are truth and judgment. (<a href="3927/psalms_111_7.htm">Psalms 111:7</a>)<p>Your mercy, O Jehovah, endures forever; do not cease the works of Your hands. (<a href="3927/psalms_138_8.htm">Psalms 138:8</a>)<p>Thus said Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: "Seek from Me signs concerning My children; concerning the work of My hands, command Me." (<a href="3927/isaiah_45_11.htm">Isaiah 45:11</a>)<p>Your people are all just..., the offshoot of My planting, the work of My hands... (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>)<p>...O Jehovah, You are our Father, we are the clay, and You our potter, and all we the work of Your hands. (<a href="3927/isaiah_64_8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 457</h4><p>457. 'Yet repented not from the works of their hands' signifies that neither did they flee from the things of their proprium, which are evils of every kind, as from sins. By 'the works of a man's hands' are signified the things of a man's proprium, which are evils and the resulting untruths, because by the 'hand' the things that proceed from the man are signified in their entirety, for the forces of the mind and the consequent forces of the body are determined into the hands and terminate there, and therefore by 'hands' in the Word is signified power. Consequently by 'the works of a man's hands' are signified the things of his proprium, which are evils and untruths of every kind. The things of the proprium of his will are evils, and the things of the proprium of his understanding are the resulting untruths. It is said of those who are treated of here that they 'repented not,' because those who make faith alone everything of religion say in themselves, 'What need is there of repentance when sins are remitted by faith alone and we are saved? What do our own works contribute to this? I know that I have been born in sins, and that I am a sinner. If I confess this, and pray that my blemishes may not be imputed to me, has not repentance then been done? What need is there for more?' And so [such a man] does not think anything of sins to the extent that he does not know what sins are, and therefore by reason of the delight and pleasantness continually derived from them he is borne along in them and into them, as is a ship on to the rocks by wind and tide, while captain and crew are sleeping.</p><p>[2] By 'the works of a man's hands' in the Word, in the natural sense thereof, are understood graven images, molten images and idols, but in the spiritual sense by them are signified evils and untruths of every kind, which are the things of a man's proprium; as in these places:<p>Provoke Me not to anger by the works of your hands; if you were provoking Me to anger by the works of your hands, [it would be] to your own evil: I will recompense them according to their works, and according to the thing done of their own hands. <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_6.htm">Jeremiah 25:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">14</a>.<p>The sons of Israel have provoked Me to anger by the works of their hands. <a href="3927/jeremiah_32_30.htm">Jeremiah 32:30</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_44_8.htm">44:8</a>.<p>I will pronounce judgments with them upon all their wickedness, that they have bowed down to the works of their own hands. <a href="3927/jeremiah_1_16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>.<p>In that day shall the eyes look to the Holy One of Israel, and not to the altars the work of their own hands, and which their fingers have made. <a href="3927/isaiah_17_7.htm">Isaiah 17:7-8</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_31_7.htm">31:7</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_37_19.htm">37:19</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a>.</p><p>[3] That 'the work of a man's hands' is his proprium, and consequently evil and untruth, can be manifestly established from the fact that for this reason they were forbidden to build the altar and the temple of hewn stones and to work with iron upon the stones, for 'the work of a man's hands' was signified by these.<p>If thou wilt make Me an altar of stones, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones, because if thou shalt work with thy chisel upon it, thou shalt profane it, <a href="3927/exodus_20_25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>.<p>Joshua built an altar of stones, upon which he did not work with iron, <a href="3927/joshua_8_30.htm">Joshua 8:30-31</a>.<p>The temple at Jerusalem was built of whole stone, and neither hammer nor axe, nor any instrument of iron was heard, when it was being built, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a>.</p><p>[4] All the things that are done by the lord are also called 'the works of His hands,' and these are the things of His Proprium, and in themselves goods and truths; as in these [places]:<p>The works of the hands of Jehovah are the truth (veritas) and judgment. <a href="3927/psalms_111_7.htm">Psalms 111:7</a>.<p>O Jehovah, Thy mercy is for ever, forsake not the works of Thy hands. <a href="3927/psalms_138_8.htm">Psalms 138:8</a>.<p>Thus says Jehovah the Holy One of Israel, and his Former, Ask signs from Me, concerning My sons, concerning the work of My hands command ye Me. <a href="3927/isaiah_45_11.htm">Isaiah 45:11</a>.<p>Thy people are all just, the twig of My branches, the work of My hands. <a href="3927/isaiah_60_21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>.<p>O Jehovah, Thou art our Father, we are the clay, and Thou art our Potter, and all of us are the work of Thy hands. <a href="3927/isaiah_64_8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a> [N.B. <a href="3927/isaiah_64_7.htm">Isaiah 64:7</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 457</h4><p>457. Yet repented not of the work of their hands, signifies that neither did they shun their own things, which are evils of every kind, as sins. By "the works of a man's hands" are signified man's own things, which are evils and falsities thence, because by "hand" are signified those things in the aggregate which proceed from man; for the powers of the mind, and thence of its body, are determined to the hands and there terminate; wherefore by "hands," in the Word, is signified power: consequently, by "the works of a man's hands," his own things are signified, which are evils and falsities of every kind; his own things in the will are evils, and his own things in the understanding are falsities thence. It is said of those who are here treated of, that they repented not; the reason is, because they who make faith alone the all of religion, say in themselves, "What need is there of repentance, when by faith alone sins are remitted, and we are saved? Of what avail are our own works in this matter? I know that I was born in sins, and that I am a sinner; if I confess this, and pray that my faults may not be imputed to me, is not the work of repentance then performed, and what need is there for anything more?" Thus he has no thought at all about sins, even so that at length he does not know that there are sins; wherefore he is continually borne along within them and into them, by the delight and pleasantness which flow from them, in like manner as a ship is carried by the wind and tide toward the rocks, whilst the pilot and mariners are asleep.</p><p>[2] By "the works of men's hands," in the Word, in its natural sense, are meant graven images, molten images, and idols; but in the spiritual sense, by them are signified evils and falsities of every kind, which are man's own things; as in these passages:<p>Provoke me not to anger by the works of your hands; if ye provoke Me to anger by the works of your hands, to your own evil, I will recompense them according to their works, and according to the deeds of their hands, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_25_6.htm">Jeremiah 25:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">14</a>).<p>The sons of Israel provoked Me to anger by the works of their hands, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_32_30.htm">Jeremiah 32:30</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_44_8.htm">44:8</a>).<p>I will speak judgments with them touching all their wickedness, that they have bowed themselves down to the works of their hands, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_1_16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>).<p>In that day the eyes shall look to the Holy One of Israel, and not to the altars, the work of their hands, and which their fingers have made, (<a href="3927/isaiah_17_7.htm">Isaiah 17:7-8</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_31_7.htm">31:7</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_37_19.htm">37:19</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a>).</p><p>[3] That "the work of a man's hands" is his proprium, and the evil and falsity thence, may be manifestly evident from this, that for that reason it was prohibited to build the altar and the temple of hewn stones, and to lift up a tool of iron upon those stones; for by this "the work of man's hands" was signified.<p>If thou makest an altar of stones unto me, thou shalt not build them hewn; because if thou movest a chisel upon it, thou wilt profane it, (<a href="3927/exodus_20_25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>).<p>Joshua built an altar of stones, upon which he did not move any iron, (<a href="3927/joshua_8_30.htm">Joshua 8:30-31</a>).<p>The temple of Jerusalem was built of whole stone, and neither hammer nor axe nor any instruments of iron were heard when it was building, (<a href="3927/1-kings_6_7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a>).</p><p>[4] All things also which are done by the Lord, are called "the works of his hands;" which are his own and in themselves goods and truths; as in these places:<p>The works of the hands of Jehovah are truth and judgment, (<a href="3927/psalms_111_7.htm">Psalms 111:7</a>).<p>O Jehovah, Thy mercy is for ever; forsake not the works of Thy hands, (<a href="3927/psalms_138_8.htm">Psalms 138:8</a>).<p>Thus said Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and His Former, ask signs of Me concerning My sons, concerning the work of My hands command ye Me, (<a href="3927/isaiah_45_11.htm">Isaiah 45:11</a>).<p>Thy people shall all be just, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>).<p>O Jehovah, Thou art our Father; we are the clay, and Thou our Potter; and we all are the work of Thy hands, (<a href="3927/isaiah_64_8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 457 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>457. "Etiam non paenitentiam egerunt ab operibus manuum Suarum," significat quod nec illi fugerint propria sua, quae sunt mala omnis generis, ut peccata. Quod per "opera manuum hominis" significentur propria hominis, quae sunt mala et inde falsa, est quia per "manus" significantur in summa illa quae procedunt ab homine, vires enim mentis et inde corporis ejus determinantur in manus, et ibi terminantur; quare per "manus" in Verbo significatur potentia: inde est, quod per "opera manuum hominis" significentur propria ejus, quae sunt mala et falsa omnis generis; propria voluntatis ejus sunt mala, et propria intellectus ejus sunt falsa inde. Quod de illis, de quibus hic agitur, dicatur, quod non paenitentiam egerint, est quia illi qui solam fidem faciunt omne religionis, dicunt in se, "Quid opus paenitentia, cum per solam fidem remittuntur peccata, et salvamur; quid faciunt opera nostra ad hoc; scio quod in peccatis natus sim, et quod peccator sim; si hoc confiteor, et oro, ut naevi mei non imputentur mihi, actane tunc est paenitentia; quid opus pluribus." Et sic non cogitat aliquid de peccatis, usque ut non sciat quod peccata sint; quare fertur ex jucundo et amoeno continue ex illis, in illis, et in illa, sicut navis secundo vento et flumine in scopulos, dormiente et nauclero et nauta.
