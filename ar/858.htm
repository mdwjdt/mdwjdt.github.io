<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>858.启20:8.“出来要迷惑地上四角的列族，就是歌革和玛各，叫他们聚集争战”表此处“龙”所指的那些人会引诱所有来自整个灵人界地区，在那里仅仅活在外在的属世敬拜中，没有活在内在的属灵敬拜中之人加入他们这一边，并煽动他们攻击那些敬拜主，照其圣言中的诫命生活之人。“出来要迷惑地上四角的列族”表示“龙”所指的那些人（<a href="856.htm">856</a>，<a href="857.htm">857</a>节论到他们）将引诱整个灵人界中的所有人；“迷惑”在此表示引诱到他们这一边；“列族”表示善者与恶者（<a href="483.htm">483</a>节）；“地上四角”表示整个灵界（<a href="342.htm">342</a>节），在此表示整个灵人界中的人，灵人界位于天堂与地狱的中间，所有人离世后首先聚集在那里（对此，参看<a href="784.htm">784</a>，<a href="791.htm">791</a>节）；因为地狱里的人不能进入龙的视线，天上的人也不能。“歌革和玛各”表示那些处于脱离内在属灵敬拜的外在属世敬拜的人，如下文所述；“叫他们聚集争战”表示煽动“列族”所指的那些人攻击那些敬拜主，照其圣言中的诫命生活的人，因为所有不敬拜主，并照其诫命生活的人都是邪恶的，而恶者与那龙，或龙们一起行动；“争战”表示属灵的战争，也就是虚假与真理，并真理与虚假的战争（参看<a href="500.htm">500</a>，<a href="586.htm">586</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 858</h4><p>858. <a href="3927/revelation_20_8.htm">20:8</a> And he will go out to lead astray the nations which are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for battle. This symbolically means that those meant by the dragon here drew to their side from any land throughout the world of spirits all who lived the life of an external, natural worship only and no internal, spiritual worship, and roused them up against those who worshiped the Lord and lived according to His commandments in the Word.<p>His going out to lead astray the nations which are at the four corners of the earth means, symbolically, that the people meant by the dragon, described just above in nos. <a href="856.htm">856</a> and <a href="857.htm">857</a>, drew to their side all throughout the world of spirits. To lead astray here means, symbolically, to draw to their side. The nations symbolize both good people and evil (no. <a href="483.htm">483</a>). The four corners of the earth symbolize the entire spiritual world (no. <a href="342.htm">342</a>), here people throughout the entire world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, and where all first gather after their departure from the earth (see nos. <a href="784.htm">784</a>, <a href="791.htm">791</a>). For people who were in hell could not be seen by the dragon, nor those who were in heaven.<p>Gog and Magog symbolize people who engage in external, natural worship divorced from any internal, spiritual worship, as discussed in the following number. To gather the nations together for battle means, symbolically, to rouse up those meant by the nations against those who worship the Lord and live according to His commandments in the Word, since all who do not worship the Lord and live according to His commandments are evil, and evil people act in concert with the dragon and its followers. The battle means a spiritual battle, which is one of falsity against truth, and of truth against falsity, as may be seen in nos. <a href="500.htm">500</a> and <a href="586.htm">586</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 858</h4><p>858. [verse 8] 'And shall go forth to lead astray the nations that are at the four corners of the land, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for war' signifies that those who are here understood by 'the dragon' would draw to their side all who were of the territories in the entire world of spirits and lived there in a worship only external natural and in no internal spiritual worship, and would rouse them up against those who worshipped the Lord and lived in accordance with His precepts in the Word. By 'he shall go forth to lead astray the nations that are at the four corners of the land' is signified that those who are understood by 'the dragon' (treated of just above, <a href="856.htm">856-857</a>) would draw to their side all who were in the entire world of spirits. By 'to lead astray' here is signified to draw to their side. By 'the nations' are signified both the good and the evil (<a href="483.htm">483</a>). By 'the four corners of the land' is signified the entire spiritual world (<a href="342.htm">342</a>), here those who were in the entire world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell and where all first come together after their departure from on earth (treated of <a href="784.htm">784</a>, <a href="791.htm">791</a>); for those who were in hell could not come into the dragon's field of vision, nor those who were in the heavens. By 'Gog and Magog' are signified those who are in external natural worship separate from internal spiritual worship, treated of in the following paragraph. By 'to gather them together for war' is signified to rouse up those who are understood by 'the nations' against those who worship the Lord and live in accordance with His precepts in the Word, because all who do not worship the Lord and do not live in accordance with His precepts are evil, and the evil act together with the dragon or the dragonists. That by 'war' is understood the spiritual war that is of untruth against truth and of truth against untruth may be seen above (<a href="500.htm">500</a>, <a href="586.htm">586</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 858</h4><p>858. Verse 8. And shall go forth to seduce the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to war, signifies that they who are here meant by the dragon, would draw to their party all those who were from the earths, in the whole world of spirits, and lived there in external natural worship alone, and in no internal spiritual worship, and would arouse them against those who worshiped the Lord, and lived according to His commandments in the Word. By "going out to seduce the nations which are in the four corners of the earth," is signified that they who are meant by "the dragon," of whom above, (<a href="856.htm">856</a>, <a href="857.htm">857</a>), would draw to their party all who were in the whole world of spirits; by "seducing" is here signified to draw to their party; by "nations" are signified both the good and the evil, (<a href="483.htm">483</a>); by "the four corners of the earth" is signified the whole spiritual world, (<a href="342.htm">342</a>, here those who were in the whole world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, and where all after their departure from the earth first assemble (concerning which <a href="784.htm">784</a>, <a href="791.htm">791</a>); for those who were in hell could not come into the sight of the dragon, nor they who were in the heavens. By "Gog and Magog" are signified they who are in external natural worship separate from internal spiritual worship, as will be shown in the next article; by "gathering them together to war" is signified to arouse those who are meant by "the nations" against those who worship the Lord and live according to His commandments in the Word, because all who do not worship the Lord and do not live according to His commandments, are evil, and the evil act together with the dragon or the dragonists; that by "war" is meant spiritual war, which is that of falsity against truth and of truth against falsity, may be seen above, (<a href="500.htm">500</a>, <a href="586.htm">586</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 858 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>858. (Vers. 8.) "Et exibit seducere gentes, quae in quatuor anguis terrae, Gogum et Magogum, congregare illos in bellum," significat quod illi qui per "Draconem" hic intelliguntur, omnes qui e terris in universo Mundo spirituum erant, et ibi in solo Cultu externo naturali et in nullo Cultu interno spirituali vixerunt, in suas partes traherent, et excitarent contra illos qui coluerunt Dominum et vixerunt secundum praecepta Ipsius in Verbo. - Per "exibit seducere gentes quae in quatuor angulis terrae" significatur quod illi qui per "Draconem" intelliguntur, de quibus mox supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_858/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_856" target=_top>856</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_858/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_857" target=_top>857</a>), omnes qui in universo Mundo spirituum erant, in suas partes traherent; per "seducere" hic significatur in suas partes trahere; per "gentes" significantur tam boni quam mali (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_858/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_483" target=_top>483</a>) per "quatuor angulos terrae" significatur universus mundus spiritualis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_858/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_342" target=_top>342</a>), hic qui in universo Mundo spirituum, qui est medius inter Caelum et Infernum, et quo omnes post excessum e terris primum conveniunt (de quo, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_858/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_784" target=_top>784</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_858/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_791" target=_top>791</a>); nam qui in Inferno erant, non in conspectum Draconis venire potuerunt, nec qui in Caelis: per "Gogum et Magogum" significantur qui in cultu externo naturali separato a cultu interno spirituali sunt, de quibus in articulo sequente: per "congregare illos in bellum" significatur excitare illos qui per "gentes" intelliguntur, contra illos qui colunt Dominum et vivunt secundum praecepta Ipsius in Verbo; quoniam omnes qui non colunt Dominum et non vivunt secundum praecepta Ipsius, mali sunt, et mali unum agunt cum Dracone seu Draconicis; quod per "bellum" intelligatur bellum spirituale, quod est falsi contra verum, ac veri contra falsum, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_858/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_500" target=_top>500</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_858/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_586" target=_top>586</a>). </p>
