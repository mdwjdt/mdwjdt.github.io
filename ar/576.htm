<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第576节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>576.启13:3.“我看见他的头中，有一个似乎受了死伤”表教义的这一条，也就是其余者的头，即人凭唯信称义并得救，无需律法的行为，并不符合圣言，因为行为是圣言所经常命令的。“头中的一个”表示改革宗教会整个教义中最首要、最基本的条款。因为这兽有七个头，“七头”表示由纯粹的虚假所产生的疯狂（<a href="568.htm">568</a>节）；因而也表示作为一个整体的全部虚假，数字“七”在圣言中表示全部（<a href="10.htm">10</a>，<a href="391.htm">391</a>节）。由于其关于救恩的教义的一切虚假皆仰赖这一条，即人凭唯信称义并得救，无需律法的行为，故“这兽头中的一个”就表示这一条。它“似乎受了死伤”表示它不符合圣言，因为行为是圣言所经常命令的。教会教义的一切事物若不符合圣言，就是不健全的，而是患有致命的疾病；因为教会的教义必来自圣言，而非来自其它源头。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 576</h4><p>576. <a href="3927/revelation_13_3.htm">13:3</a> And I saw one of its heads appearing as though fatally wounded. This symbolically means that this point of doctrine, which is at the head of all the rest, that a person is justified and saved by faith alone apart from works of the law, does not accord with the Word, in which works are so often commanded.<p>One of its heads symbolizes the principal and fundamental point of the entire doctrine of the Protestant Reformed Church; for the beast had seven heads, which symbolize irrationality resulting from absolute falsities (no. <a href="568.htm">568</a>), thus also all their falsities in their entirety, inasmuch as the number seven in the Word symbolizes all (nos. <a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="390.htm">390</a>). And because their doctrinal falsities regarding salvation all depend on this one, that a person is justified and saved by faith alone apart from works of the law, that is the one symbolized here by one of the beast's heads.<p>Its appearing as though fatally wounded means symbolically that it does not accord with the Word, in which works are so often commanded. For every tenet of the church's doctrine that does not accord with the Word is not sound, but is sick with a deadly disease, inasmuch as the doctrine of the church must come from the Word and from nowhere else. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 576</h4><p>576. [verse 3] 'And I saw one of his heads as if wounded to death' signifies that this point of doctrine, which is the head of all the rest, that a man is justified and saved through faith alone without the works of the law, is not in agreement with the Word, where works are so often commanded. By 'one of his heads' is signified the principal and fundamental point of the whole of the doctrine of the Church of the Reformed; for the beast had 'seven heads,' by which the insanity resulting from sheer untruths is signified (<a href="568.htm">568</a>), thus also all untruths in the aggregate; for by 'seven' in the Word all are signified (<a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="390.htm">390</a>). And because all the untruths of their doctrine concerning salvation depend upon this one, 'that a man is justified and saved by faith alone without the works of the law,' it is this that is signified here by 'one of the beast's heads.' By its being 'as if wounded to death' is signified that it is not in agreement with the Word, where works are so often commanded; for every doctrine of the Church that is not in agreement with the Word is not sound, but sick with a deadly disease; for out of the Word, and from no other source, will the doctrine of the Church be. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 576</h4><p>576. Verse 3. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded unto death, signifies that this point of doctrine, which is the head of the rest, that man is justified and saved by faith alone without the works of the law, does not agree with the Word, where works are so often commanded. By "one of the heads" is signified the chief and fundamental article of the whole doctrine of the church of the Reformed. For the beast had seven heads, by which is signified insanity from mere falsities, (<a href="568.htm">568</a>); thus also all falsities in the aggregate: for by "seven" in the Word is signified all, (<a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="391.htm">391</a>). And as all the falsities of their doctrine concerning salvation depend on this one, that man is justified and saved by faith alone without the works of the law, it is this which is signified by "one of the heads of the beast." By its being "as it were wounded unto death," is signified that it does not agree with the Word, where works are so often commanded. For everything of the doctrine of the church, which does not agree with the Word, is not sound, but is sick with a deadly disease; for the doctrine of the church must be from the Word, and from no other source. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 576 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>576. (Vers. 3.) "Et vidi unum capitum ejus sicut sauciatum in mortem," significat quod hoc doctrinae, quod est caput reliquorum, quod homo justificetur et salvetur per solam Fidem absque Operibus Legis, non concordet cum Verbo, ubi toties Opera mandantur. - Per "unum capitum" significatur praecipuum et fundamentale totius doctrinae Ecclesiae Reformatorum; erant enim septem capita Bestiae, per quae significatur insania ex meris falsis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_576/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_568" target=_top>568</a>), ita quoque omnia falsa in complexu; per "septem" enim in Verbo significantur omnia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_576/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_10" target=_top>10</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_576/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_391" target=_top>391</a>); et quia omnia falsa doctrinae illorum de salvatione pendent ab hoc uno, quod homo justificetur et salvetur per solam Fidem absque Operibus Legis, est hoc quod per "unum capitum Bestiae" hic significatur: per illud "sicut sauciatum in mortem," significatur quod id non concordet cum Verbo, ubi toties mandantur opera; omne enim doctrinae Ecclesiae, quod non concordat cum Verbo, non sanum est, sed aegrotat morbo mortis; nam ex Verbo, et non aliunde, erit Doctrina Ecclesiae. </p>
