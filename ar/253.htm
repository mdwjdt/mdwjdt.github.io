<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第253节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>253.“说，主啊，你是配得荣耀、尊贵、权柄的”表告明主因是神性真理和神性良善而凭功与义拥有这个国度。“说”表示告明。“主啊，你是配得的”表示这是凭功与义；“荣耀、尊贵”表示主是神性真理和神性良善（参看<a href="249.htm">249</a>节）。“配得权柄”表示主就是这个国度。因此，这些合成一个意思，就表示告明主因是神性真理和神性良善而凭功与义拥有这个国度。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 253</h4><p>253. Saying, "You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power." (<a href="3927/revelation_4_11.htm">4:11</a>) This symbolizes their confession that, being Divine truth and good, the Lord possesses the kingdom by His merit and righteousness.<p>Confession is symbolically meant by "saying." His merit and righteousness are symbolically meant by "You are worthy, O Lord." That the Lord is Divine truth and Divine good is symbolically meant by glory and honor, as in no. <a href="249.htm">249</a> above. And that He possesses the kingdom is symbolically meant by receiving power.<p>Brought together into a single expression of the meaning therefore, these phrases symbolize their confession that, being Divine truth and good, the Lord possesses the kingdom by His merit and righteousness. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 253</h4><p>253. [verse 11] 'Saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to take to Thyself glory and honour and power' signifies the confession that the Lord, because He is Divine Truth and Divine Good, has the kingdom by virtue of merit and justice. 'Confession' is signified by 'saying'; that it is 'by virtue of merit and justice' is signified by 'Thou art worthy, O Lord'; that He is Divine Truth and Divine Good is signified by 'glory and honour,' as above (<a href="249.htm">249</a>); that He has the kingdom is signified by 'take to Thyself power.' Accordingly, these things gathered together into one meaning signify the confession that the Lord, because He is Divine Truths and Divine Good, has the kingdom by virtue of merit and justice. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 253</h4><p>253. Verse 11. Saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power, signifies the confession that the kingdom is the Lord's from merit and justice, because He is the Divine truth and the Divine good. Confession is signified by "saying." That it is from merit and justice is signified by "thou art worthy, O Lord;" that He is the Divine truth and the Divine good, is signified by "glory and honor," as above, (<a href="249.htm">249</a>). That His is the kingdom is signified by "receiving power": these, therefore, collected into one sense, signify the confession that the kingdom is the Lord's from merit and justice, because He is the Divine truth and the Divine good. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 253 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>253. "Dicentes," (Vers. 11.) "Dignus es Domine accipere gloriam et honorem et potestatem," significat confessionem, quod Domino, quia est Divinum Verum et Divinum Bonum, sit Regnum ex merito et justitia. - Confessio significatur per "dicere;" quod ex merito et justitia, significatur per "dignus es Domine;" quod Ipse sit Divinum Verum et Divinum Bonum, significatur per "gloriam et honorem," ut supra, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_253/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_11" target=_top>11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_253/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_249" target=_top>249</a>); quod Ipsi sit Regnum, significatur per "accipere potestatem:" haec itaque in unum sensum collata, significant confessionem, quod Domino, quia est Divinum Verum et Divinum Bonum, sit Regnum ex merito et justitia. </p>
