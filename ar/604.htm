<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>604.启13:16.“他又叫众人，无论大小贫富，自主的，为奴的”表那教会中的所有人，无论他们的状况、学问和聪明如何。“大小”在此表示那些具有或大或小尊严的人，无论是什么状况；“贫富”表示那些拥有或多或少的知识和学问之人（<a href="206.htm">206</a>节），无论学问的程度如何；“自主的和为奴的”表示那些靠自己而变得智慧的人，和那些从他人获得智慧的人（<a href="337.htm">337</a>节），无论聪明的程度如何。因此，“众人，无论大小贫富，自主的，为奴的”表示那教会中的所有人，无论他们的状况、学问和聪明如何。这些便是灵义上所表示的事。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 604</h4><p>604. <a href="3927/revelation_13_16.htm">13:16</a> And it causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave. This symbolizes all the people in the Protestant Reformed church, of whatever condition, degree of education, or degree of intelligence.<p>The small and great here mean people of a lesser or greater degree of status, thus of whatever condition. The rich and poor mean people of more or less knowledge and learning (no. <a href="206.htm">206</a>), thus of whatever degree of education. Free and slave mean people who acquire wisdom on their own or who gain it from others (no. <a href="337.htm">337</a>), thus of whatever degree of intelligence.<p>So then, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, mean all the people in the Protestant Reformed church of whatever condition, degree of education, or degree of intelligence. This is the meaning in the spiritual sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 604</h4><p>604. [verse 16] 'And he causes all the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond' signifies all in that Church of whatever condition, learning and intelligence they are. By 'the small and the great' here are understood those who are in a greater or lesser degree of dignity, thus of whatever condition. By 'the rich and the poor' are understood those who are more or less in cognitions and knowledges (<a href="206.htm">206</a>), thus of whatever learning. By 'the free and the bond' are understood those who are wise from themselves or from others (<a href="337.htm">337</a>), thus of whatever intelligence. Consequently now by 'All the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the bond' are understood all in that Church of whatever condition, learning and intelligence they are. These things are in the spiritual sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 604</h4><p>604. Verse 16. And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich, and the poor, the free and the bond, signifies all in that church, whatsoever may be their condition, learning and intelligence. By "the small and the great" are here meant they who are in a greater or lesser degree of dignity, thus of whatever condition; by "the rich and the poor" are meant they who are more or less in knowledges and sciences, (<a href="206.htm">206</a>), thus of whatever degree of learning; by "the free and the bond" are meant they who are wise from themselves, and they who are wise from others, (<a href="337.htm">337</a>), thus of whatever degree of intelligence. Therefore by "all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the bond," are meant all in that church whatever may be their condition, learning and intelligence. These are the things that are meant in the spiritual sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 604 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>604. (Vers. 16.) "Et facit omnes parvos et magnos, et divites et pauperes, et liberos et servos," significat omnes in illa Ecclesia ex quacunque conditione, eruditione et intelligentia sunt. - Per "parvos et magnos" hic intelliguntur qui in minori et majori gradu dignitatis sunt, ita ex quacunque conditione; per "divites et pauperes" intelliguntur qui in cognitionibus et scientiis plus et minus sunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_604/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_206" target=_top>206</a>), ita ex quacunque eruditione; per "liberos et servos" intelliguntur qui sapiunt ex se et qui ex aliis (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_604/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_337" target=_top>337</a>), ita ex quacunque intelligentia: inde nunc per "omnes parvos et magnos, divites et pauperes, liberos et servos," intelliguntur omnes in illa Ecclesia ex quacunque conditione, eruditione et intelligentia sunt. Haec in Sensu spirituali. </p>
