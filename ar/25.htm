<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第25节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>25.“众目要看见祂”表所有出于情感理解神性真理的人都将承认祂。在灵义上，“目”不是指眼睛，而是指理解力。因此，“众目要看见祂”表示所有出于情感理解神性真理的人都将承认祂，因为唯独他们理解并承认。其他人虽能看见，也能理解，却不承认。所以此处是指前者，因为接下来经上说“连刺祂的人也要看见祂”，他们就是那些处于虚假的人。“目”表示理解力，这一点可见于下文（<a href="48.htm">48</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 25</h4><p>25. And every eye will see Him. This symbolically means that all those will acknowledge Him who possess, from an affection for it, an understanding of Divine truth.<p>In the spiritual sense an eye means not an eye but the intellect. Consequently the declaration that every eye will see. This symbolically means that all those will acknowledge Him who possess, from an affection for it, an understanding of Divine truth, since it is they alone who understand and acknowledge. Others, indeed, see and also understand, but they do not acknowledge.<p>Those who acknowledge are symbolically meant because it is next said that they also who pierced Him will see, meaning people who are caught up in falsities.<p>To be shown that an eye symbolizes the intellect, see no. <a href="48.htm">48</a> below. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 25</h4><p>25. 'And every eye shall see Him' signifies that all who out of affection are in an understanding of Divine Truth are going to recognise [this]. In the spiritual sense by 'eye' is not understood an eye, but understanding, therefore by 'every eye shall see' is signified that all who out of affection are in an understanding of Divine Truth are going to acknowledge [this], since they alone understand and acknowledge. The rest indeed see and they also understand, but they do not acknowledge. Those [who also acknowledge] are signified, because it follows, that 'they who pierced Him' are also going to see, by whom are understood those who are in untruths. That 'eye' signifies understanding will be seen below (<a href="48.htm">48</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 25</h4><p>25. And every eye shall see Him, signifies that all who are in the understanding of Divine truth from affection will acknowledge Him. In the spiritual sense, by "eye" is not meant the eye, but the understanding; therefore, "every eye shall see Him," signifies that all who are in the understanding of Divine truth from affection will acknowledge Him, because they alone understand and acknowledge. The rest see indeed and also understand, but do not acknowledge; the former, then, are signified, because it follows, that "they also who pierced Him" will see Him, by whom are meant those who are in falsities. That "the eye" signifies the understanding, will be seen below, (<a href="48.htm">48</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 25 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>25. "Et videbit Ipsum omnis oculus," significat quod agnituri omnes qui ex affectione in intellectu Divini Veri sunt. -In Sensu spirituali per "oculum" non intelligitur oculus, sed intellectus; quare per "videbit omnis oculus," significatur quod agnituri omnes qui ex affectione in intellectu Divini Veri sunt, quoniam illi soli intelligunt et agnoscunt; reliqui quidem vident et quoque intelligunt, sed non agnoscunt: illi significantur, quia sequitur quod etiam visuri sint, "qui Ipsum transfixerunt," per quos intelliguntur qui in falsis sunt. Quod "Oculus" significet intellectum, videbitur infra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_25/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_48" target=_top>48</a>). </p>
