<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第506节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>506.“又不许把尸首放在坟墓里”表他们已经诅咒并还会诅咒它们。此处“尸首”表示新教会的两大基本要素，如前所述（<a href="505.htm">505</a>节等）；“不许把尸首放在坟墓里”表示弃绝它们如被诅咒的那样。之所以表示这一点，是因为“放在坟墓里”或“埋葬”表示复活和生命的继续，因到那时，来自地上、因而尘世和不洁之物归于大地；故“不放进坟墓”或“不埋葬”就表示仍继续留在尘世和不洁之物中，并因此被弃绝如被诅咒的那样。正因如此，以色列人当中的教会（该教会是一个代表性教会）有这样一个条例：那些被认为受了诅咒的人当被扔掉，不得埋葬，这一点从这些话明显看出来：</p><p>耶和华论到他们如此说，他们必死得甚苦，无人哀哭，必不得葬埋；必在地面上像粪土；他们的尸首必给空中的飞鸟和地上的野兽作食物。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶16.3.htm">16:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶16.4.htm">4</a>）</p><p>说谎言的先知必被抛在耶路撒冷的街道上，无人葬埋。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.16.htm">14:16</a>）</p><p>到那一天，他们必将犹大王的骸骨和他首领的骸骨、祭司的骸骨、先知的骸骨并耶路撒冷居民的骸骨，都从坟墓中取出来；这些骸骨不再收殓，不再葬埋，必在地面上成为粪土。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.1.htm">8:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>耶洗别必在田里被狗所吃，无人葬埋。（列王纪下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下9.10.htm">9:10</a>）</p><p>惟独你被抛弃，不得入你的坟墓，好像可憎的枝子；又像脚下被践踏的尸首一样。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.19.htm">14:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.20.htm">20</a>）</p><p>此外还有其它地方（如耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.32.htm">25:32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.33.htm">33</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶22.19.htm">22:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.32.htm">7:32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.33.htm">33</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶19.11.htm">19:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶19.12.htm">12</a>；列王纪下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.16.htm">23:16</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 506</h4><p>506. And not allow their bodies to be put into tombs. This symbolically means that they have condemned these two essential elements and will continue to condemn them.<p>The bodies here symbolize the two essential elements of the New Church, as explained in no. <a href="505.htm">505</a> and earlier numbers. And not allowing these to be put into tombs symbolizes their rejection as condemned. This is the symbolic meaning because putting people into tombs or burying them symbolizes their resurrection and continuation of life, for committed to the earth then are the materials taken from the earth, thus things that are earthly and so unclean. Thus not to be put into tombs or buried means, symbolically, to remain immersed in earthly and unclean things, and therefore to be rejected as condemned.<p>It was owing to this that in the church among the children of Israel, which was a representational church, it was a statute that people regarded as condemned be cast out and not buried, as is apparent from the following passages:<p>(Jehovah said concerning them,) "They shall die harsh deaths. They shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried; they shall become dung on the face of the earth... and their dead bodies shall become food for the birds of the air and for the animals of the earth." (<a href="3927/jeremiah_16_3.htm">Jeremiah 16:3-4</a>)<p>(Prophets who prophesy falsely) shall be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem... having no one to bury them. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_14_15.htm">Jeremiah 14:15-16</a>)<p>At that time... they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of its princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets... from their graves... They shall not be gathered nor buried; they shall become dung on the face of the earth. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_8_1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1-2</a>)<p>The dogs would eat Jezebel on the plot of ground... having no one to bury her. (<a href="3927/2-kings_9_10.htm">2 Kings 9:10</a>)<p>...you have been cast out of your grave like an abominable twig..., like a corpse trodden underfoot. You will not be joined with them in burial... (<a href="3927/isaiah_14_19.htm">Isaiah 14:19-20</a>)<p>And so on elsewhere, as in <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_32.htm">Jeremiah 25:32-33</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_22_19.htm">22:19</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_32.htm">7:32-33</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_19_11.htm">19:11-12</a>, <a href="3927/2-kings_23_16.htm">2 Kings 23:16</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 506</h4><p>506. 'And shall not allow their bodies to be put into tombs' signifies that they have damned and are going to damn them. By the 'bodies' here are signified the two Essentials of the New Church (treated of <a href="505.htm">505</a> and above); and by 'not allow to be put into tombs' is signified to reject as if damned. This is signified because by 'to be put into tombs' or to be buried is signified resurrection and the continuation of life, for then the things derived from the earth are committed to the earth, thus the things that are earthly and in consequence unclean. Consequently by 'not to be put into tombs' or not to be buried is signified to remain in earthly and unclean things, and on that account to be rejected as if damned. This is why in the Church with the sons of Israel, which was a representative Church, there was a statute that those who were regarded as damned should be cast forth and not buried, as is plain from these [statements]:<p>Jehovah has said concerning them, They shall die with grievous deaths, they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried, they shall be for dung upon the faces of the land, and their carcase shall be for food to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the land. <a href="3927/jeremiah_16_3.htm">Jeremiah 16:3-4</a>.<p>The prophets prophesying lies shall be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem, and none burying. <a href="3927/jeremiah_14_16.htm">Jeremiah 14:16</a>.<p>In that day they shall drag out the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets out of their graves; they shall neither be gathered nor buried; they shall be for dung upon the faces of the land. <a href="3927/jeremiah_8_1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1-2</a>.<p>That the dogs devoured Jezebel in the field, and none burying, <a href="3927/2-kings_9_10.htm">2 Kings 9:10</a>.<p>Thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable shoot, like a carcase trodden under foot. <a href="3927/isaiah_14_19.htm">Isaiah 14:19-20</a>; besides elsewhere, as <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_32.htm">Jeremiah 25:32-33</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_22_19.htm">22:19</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_32.htm">7:32-33</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_19_11.htm">19:11-12</a>; <a href="3927/2-kings_23_16.htm">2 Kings 23:16</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 506</h4><p>506. And shall not suffer their bodies to be put into monuments, signifies that they condemned and will condemn them. By "bodies" are here signified the two essentials of the New Church (of which, <a href="505.htm">505</a> and above); and by "not suffering them to be put into monuments," is signified to reject them as condemned. This is signified, because by "being put into monuments," or "buried," is signified resurrection and continuation of life, for then those things are committed to the earth which are from the earth, thus which are earthly and thence unclean; therefore by "not being put into monuments," or "not being buried," is signified to continue in things earthly and unclean, and for that reason to be rejected as condemned. It was on this account that in the church with the sons of Israel, which was a representative church, it was instituted, that they who were considered as condemned, should be cast forth and not buried, as is evident from these things:<p>Thus saith Jehovah concerning them, they shall die of grievous deaths, they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth; and their carcass shall be for food to the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_16_3.htm">Jeremiah 16:3-4</a>).<p>The prophets that prophesy a lie shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, none burying, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_14_16.htm">Jeremiah 14:16</a>).<p>In that day they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets out of their sepulchers; they shall not be collected nor buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_8_1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1-2</a>).<p>That the dogs devoured Jezebel in the field, none burying, (<a href="3927/2-kings_9_10.htm">2 Kings 9:10</a>).<p>Thou wast cast out of thy sepulchre like an abominable shoot; as a carcass trodden under feet, (<a href="3927/isaiah_14_19.htm">Isaiah 14:19-20</a>);<p>besides other places; as in <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_32.htm">Jeremiah 25:32-33</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_22_19.htm">22:19</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_7_32.htm">7:32-33</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_19_11.htm">19:11-12</a>; <a href="3927/2-kings_23_16.htm">2 Kings 23:16</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 506 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>506. "Et corpora illorum non permittent poni in monumenta," significat quod damnaverint et damnaturi sint illa. - Per "corpora" hic significantur duo illa Essentialia Novae Ecclesiae (de quibus <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_506/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_505" target=_top>505</a>, et supra); et per "non permittere poni in monumenta" significatur rejicere sicut damnata. Quod hoc significetur, est quia per "poni in monumenta" seu "sepeliri" significatur resurrectio et continuatio vitae, tunc enim terrae mandantur quae ex terra sunt, ita quae terrestria et inde immunda sunt; inde per "non poni in monumenta" seu "non sepeliri" significatur manere in terrestribus et immundis, et propterea rejici sicut damnatum. Inde erat quod in Ecclesia apud filios Israelis, quae fuit Ecclesia repraesentativa, fuerit statutum, <sup>1</sup>quod qui spectabantur ut damnati, projicerentur et non sepelirentur, ut patet ab his: <p>Jehovah dixit de illis, "Mortibus aegris morientur, non plangentur neque sepelientur, in stercus super faciebus terrae erunt, et erit cadaver eorum in cibum avibus caelorum et bestiae terrae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_506/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_16_3-4" target=_top>Jeremias 16:3-4</a>);<p>Prophetae prophetantes mendacium "erunt abjecti in Plateis Hierosolymae, nec sepeliens," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_506/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_15_16" target=_top>Jeremias 15:16</a>);<p>"In die illo extrahent ossa Regum Jehudae, ossa principum ejus, et ossa sacerdotum, et ossa prophetarum e sepulchris eorum; non colligentur, neque sepelientur; in stercus super faciebus terrae erunt," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_506/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_8_1-2" target=_top>Jeremias 8:1-2</a>);<p>Quod "Jesabelem comederent canes in agro, nec sepeliens," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_506/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-kings_9_10" target=_top>2 Regnum 9:10</a>);<p>"Tu projectus es e sepulchro tuo sicut surculus abominabilis, sicut cadaver conculcatum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_506/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_14_19-20" target=_top>Esaias 14:19-20</a>).<p>(Praeter alibi, ut <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_506/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_25_32-33" target=_top>Jeremias 25:32-33</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_506/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_22_19" target=_top>22:19</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_506/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_7_32-33" target=_top>7:32-33</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_506/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_19_11-12" target=_top>19:11-12</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_506/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-kings_23_16" target=_top>2 Regnum 23:16</a>). <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;statutum pro "statum" </p>
