<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第517节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>517.“其余的都恐惧，归荣耀给天上的神”表那些将些许仁之良善联结于信的人当看见他们毁灭时，就承认主，并被分开。此处“其余的”表示那些将些许仁之良善联结于信的人；“恐惧”表示他们因看到其他人毁灭而害怕；“归荣耀给天上的神”表示承认主是天地之神；“归荣耀”是指承认和敬拜；“天地之神”是指主，因为祂是天地之神（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">28:18</a>）。这些因出于恐惧而承认主的人被分开，是为了让他们接受审查，看看他们行善的根源，是出于自己还是出于主。凡不避恶如罪，也就是不照十诫生活的人都出于自己行善；而凡避恶如罪并照十诫生活的人都出于主行善。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 517</h4><p>517. And the rest were afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven. This symbolically means that when they saw the destruction of those others, people who had joined some goods of charity to their faith acknowledged the Lord and were set apart.<p>The rest here mean people who had joined some goods of charity to their faith. Their being terrified symbolizes their fear on seeing the destruction of those others. To give glory to the God of heaven means, symbolically, to acknowledge the Lord as God of heaven and earth - to give glory symbolizing to acknowledge and worship, and the God of heaven meaning the Lord, because He is God of heaven and earth (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p>Because these people were moved by their fear to acknowledge the Lord, they were set apart in order that they might be examined as to the basis on which they did goods, whether they did so on their own or from the Lord. People who do goods on their own are all those who do not refrain from evils as being sins, that is, who do not live according to the Ten Commandments, whereas people who do them from the Lord are those who do refrain from evils as being sins and live according to the Ten Commandments. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 517</h4><p>517. 'And the rest became frightened, and gave glory to the God of heaven' signifies that those who had adjoined some good of charity to faith, when they saw their destruction, acknowledged the Lord and were separated. By 'the rest' are understood here those who had adjoined some good of charity to faith. By 'became frightened' is signified on account of fear when they saw the destruction of the others. By 'to give glory to the God of heaven' is signified to acknowledge the Lord as the God of heaven and earth; by 'to give glory' is signified to acknowledge and worship, and by 'the God of heaven and earth' is understood the Lord, because He is the God of heaven and earth (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). These, because they acknowledged the Lord out of fear, were separated so that they might be examined as to the origin out of which they did good, whether out of themselves or out of the Lord. All those do good out of themselves who are not fleeing from evils as sins, that is, who are not living the precepts of the Decalogue; but they do good out of the Lord who are [so] fleeing and living. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 517</h4><p>517. And the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven, signifies that they who had adjoined some goods of charity to faith, when they saw their destruction, acknowledged the Lord, and were separated. By "the rest" are here meant they who adjoined some goods of charity to faith; by "being terrified" is signified through fear, when they saw the destruction of the others; by "giving glory to the God of heaven" is signified to acknowledge the Lord as the God of heaven and earth; by "giving glory" is signified to acknowledge and worship; and by "the God of heaven and earth" is meant the Lord, because He is the God of heaven and earth, (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). These, because they acknowledged the Lord from fear, were separated, in order that they might be explored as to the origin from which they did good, whether from themselves or from the Lord. All they do good from themselves who do not shun evils as sins, that is, who do not live according to the commandments of the Decalogue; but they do good from the Lord, who so shun and live. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 517 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>517. "Et reliqui territi facti sunt, et dederunt gloriam Deo Caeli" significat quod illi qui aliqua bona charitatis adjunxerunt fidei, cum viderunt interitum illorum, agnoverint Dominum, et separati sint. - Per "reliquos" intelliguntur hic qui aliqua bona charitatis adjunxerunt fidei; per "territos factos" significatur ex timore cum viderunt interitum aliorum: per "dare gloriam Deo Caeli" significatur agnoscere Dominum pro Deo Caeli et Terrae; per "dare gloriam" significatur agnoscere et colere, et per "Deum Caeli et Terrae" intelligitur Dominus, quia Ille est Deus Caeli et Terrae, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_517/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_28_18" target=_top>Matthaeus 28:18</a>). Hi, quia ex timore agnoverunt Dominum, separati sunt, ut explorarentur ex qua origine fecerunt bona, num ex se vel num ex Domino. Omnes illi faciunt bona ex se qui non fugiunt mala ut peccata, hoc est, qui non vivunt praecepta Decalogi; at ex Domino, qui fugiunt et vivunt. </p>
