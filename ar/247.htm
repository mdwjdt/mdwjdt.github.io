<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第247节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>247.“他们昼夜不住地说，圣哉，圣哉，圣哉，主神，全能者”表圣言不断教导关于主的教义，唯独祂是神，因而唯独祂当受敬拜。四活物“昼夜不住地说”表示圣言不断、不间歇地教导；它教导四活物所说的话，即“圣哉，圣哉，圣哉，主神全能者”，也就是说，唯独主是神，因此唯独主当受敬拜。这就是圣哉重复三次的含义，因为重复三次包含唯独主里面的一切神圣。神性三位一体在里面，这一点在《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》已经充分说明，那里还说明，圣言唯独论述主，其神圣性由此而来。唯独主是神圣的（参看<a href="173.htm">173</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 247</h4><p>247. And they did not rest day or night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty." This symbolically means that the Word teaches the Lord continually, that He alone is God, and that therefore He alone is to be worshiped.<p>The living creatures not resting day or night means, symbolically, that the Word teaches continually and without interruption, and that it teaches what the living creatures were saying, namely, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty," meaning that the Lord alone is God and that He is therefore to be worshiped. The word "holy" repeated three times has this symbolic meaning, because the tripling of it includes all holiness being in Him alone.<p>In The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord we fully showed that the Divine Trinity exists in the Lord, moreover that the Word has as its subject the Lord alone, and that this is the reason for its holiness.<p>To be shown that the Lord alone is holy, see no. <a href="173.htm">173</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 247</h4><p>247. And had no rest day and night, saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty' signifies that the Word is continually teaching [the doctrine of] the Lord, and that He Only is God, and consequently that He Only is to be worshipped. That the animals 'had no rest day and night' signifies that the Word is teaching continually and without intermission, and that it is teaching what the animals say. [The words] are 'Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty' that is, that the Lord Only is God, and consequently that He Only is to be worshipped. 'Holy' thrice mentioned signifies this, for the triplication involves all the 'holy' in Him Only. That the Divine Trinity is in the Lord has been fully shown in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD, as also that the Word treats of the Only Lord, and that its sanctity is therefrom. That the Lord Only is holy may be seen above (<a href="173.htm">173</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 247</h4><p>247. And they had no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, signifies that the Word continually teaches of the Lord, and that He alone is God, and thence that He alone is to be worshiped. "The animals had no rest day and night," signifies that the Word continually, and without intermission, teaches; and that it teaches what the animals say, namely, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty," that is, that the Lord alone is God, and thence that He alone is to be worshiped. This is what is signified by holy three times repeated, for the triplication involves all holiness in Him alone. That the Divine Trinity is in the Lord, is fully shown in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord; as also that the Word treats of the Lord alone, and that thence is its sanctity. That the Lord alone is holy, may be seen above, (<a href="173.htm">173</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 247 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>247. "Et requiem non habebant die et nocte, dicentia, Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus Dominus Deus Omnipotens," significat quod Verbum continue doceat Dominum, et quod Ille Solus Deus sit, et inde quod Solus colendus sit. - Quod Animalia "non requiem haberent die et nocte" significat quod Verbum continue et absque intermissione doceat; et quod doceat; id quod Animalia dicunt, quae sunt, "Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus Dominus Deus Omnipotens," hoc est, quod Dominus Solus Deus sit, et inde quod Solus colendus; hoc significat Sanctus ter nominatus, nam triplicatio involvit omne Sanctum in Ipso Solo. Quod Divina Trinitas in Domino sit, in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino, plene ostensum est; tum etiam quod Verbum de Solo Domino agat, et quod inde sanctitas ejus sit. Quod Dominus Solus Sanctus sit, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_247/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173" target=_top>173</a>). </p>
