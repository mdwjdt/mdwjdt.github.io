<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第122节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>122.“石上写着新名”表他们以这种方式拥有诸如他们之前所没有的一种良善品质。“名”表事物的品质（参看<a href="81.htm">81</a>节），故在此表良善的品质。良善的全部品质皆来自与之结合的真理；因为良善若无真理，好比没有酒和水的饼和食物，无从得到滋养，还好比没有果汁的果实，或没有叶子的树，上面只挂着秋后残存的一些枯果。这也是主说这些话的意思：</p><p>因为必用火当盐腌各人，凡祭物必用盐腌。盐本是好的，若失了咸味，可用什么来调味呢？你们里头应当有盐。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.49.htm">9:49</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.50.htm">50</a>）</p><p>“盐”在此是指对真理的渴慕。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 122</h4><p>122. "'And on the stone a new name written.'" This symbolically means that thus they will have a quality of good that they did not have before.<p>A name symbolizes the character of a thing, as may be seen in no. <a href="81.htm">81</a> above, and here therefore the character or quality of good. Good has all its character from the truths with which it is united, for good without truths is like bread without wine or food without water, which do not nourish. It is also like a fruit that contains no juice. Such goods appear, too, like trees stripped of their leaves, with wizened apples left hanging on them from autumn.<p>This, moreover, is the meaning of these words of the Lord:<p>...everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt. Salt is good, but if the salt loses its saltiness, how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves... (<a href="3927/mark_9_49.htm">Mark 9:49-50</a>)<p>The salt there is a desire for truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 122</h4><p>122. 'And in the little stone a new name written' signifies that in this way they will have good of a quality they did not have before. That 'name' signifies the quality of a thing may be seen above (<a href="81.htm">81</a>). Here, therefore, it signifies the quality of the good. Every quality of a good results from the truths united thereto; for good without truths is like bread and food without wine and water, and they are not nourishing; and also like fruit in which there is no juice. [Those whose good is without truths] also appear as trees stripped of their leaves, on which dry apples are hanging left over from autumn. This is understood also by these words of the Lord:<p>Every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. Salt is good, but if the salt becomes insipid, wherewith will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, <a href="3927/mark_9_49.htm">Mark 9:49-50</a>.<p>'Salt' there is a longing for truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 122</h4><p>122. And in the stone a new name written, signifies that thus they will have good of a quality such as they had not before. That "name" signifies the quality of a thing, may be seen above, (<a href="81.htm">81</a>[1-4]) therefore here the quality of good. All the quality of good is from the truths that are united to it; for good without truths is like bread and food without wine and water, which do not nourish; and also like fruit in which there is no juice. It appears also like trees stripped of the leaves, on which there hang a few dry apples left from the autumn. This is also meant by these words of the Lord:<p>For everyone shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, (<a href="3927/mark_9_49.htm">Mark 9:49-50</a>).<p>Salt here is the desire of truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 122 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>122. "Et in calculo nomen novum scriptum," significat quod sic illis quale boni quod non prius. - Quod "nomen" significet quale rei, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_122/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_81" target=_top>81</a>), hic itaque quale boni; omne quale boni est ex veris ei unitis; bonum enim absque veris est sicut panis et cibus absque vino et aqua, qui non nutriunt; et quoque sicut fructus in quo non succus; apparent etiam sicut arbores nudatae foliis, in quibus pendent poma sicca ex autumno relicta: hoc quoque intelligitur per haec Domini verba: <p>"Omnis igne salietur, et omne sacrificium sale salietur: bonum est sal, si autem sal insulsum fiat, quonam illud condietis: habete in vobis salem," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_122/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_9_49-50" target=_top>Marcus 9:49-50</a>);<p>"sal" ibi est desiderium ad verum. </p>
