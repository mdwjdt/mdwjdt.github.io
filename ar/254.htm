<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>254.“因为你创造了万物，并且万物是因你的旨意而存在、被创造”表天堂和教会的一切事物的被造和形成，以及人的改造和重生，都是出于主的神性之爱藉其神性智慧，或其神性良善藉其神性真理，也就是圣言。这就是这些话的灵义，因为“创造”表示藉神性真理改造和重生，“主的旨意”表示神性良善。无论你说神性良善和神性真理，还是说神性之爱和神性智慧，意思都一样。因为一切良善皆属于爱，一切真理皆属于智慧。天堂和教会的一切事物皆出于神性之爱和神性智慧，事实上，这个世界就是出于它们而被造的。这在《圣爱与圣智》一书有大量说明，该书还说明，爱与良善属于意愿，而智慧与真理属于认知。由此明显可知，“主的旨意”是指主的神性良善或神性之爱。</p><p>在圣言中，“创造”表示改造和重生。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>神啊，求你为我造清洁的心，使我中间重新有坚定的灵。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗51.10.htm">51:10</a>）</p><p>你张手，它们饱得美食；你发出你的灵，它们便受造。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.28.htm">104:28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.30.htm">30</a>）</p><p>将来受造的民，要赞美耶和华。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗102.18.htm">102:18</a>）</p><p>看哪，我造新天新地，你们当因我所造的永远欢喜快乐；看哪，我造耶路撒冷为人所喜。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.17.htm">65:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.18.htm">18</a>）</p><p>耶和华创造诸天，将地铺开，赐气息给地上的民，又赐灵给行在其上的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.5.htm">42:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.12.htm">45:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.18.htm">18</a>）</p><p>雅各啊，创造你的耶和华；以色列啊，形成你的那位，现在如此说，我救赎了你。我曾提你的名召你；凡称为我名下的人，是我为自己的荣耀创造的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.1.htm">43:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.7.htm">7</a>）</p><p>它们都是在你受造之日预备齐全的；你从受造之日所行的都完全，后来在你中间又察出不义。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结 28.13.htm"> 28:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结 28.15.htm">15</a>）</p><p>这些话论及推罗王，推罗王表示那些因神性真理而具有聪明的人。</p><p>好叫他们看见，知道，思想，明白，这是耶和华的手所作的，是以色列的圣者所造的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.20.htm">41:20</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 254</h4><p>254. "For You created all things, and by Your will they exist and were created." This symbolically means that everything in heaven and the church has been created and formed out of the Lord's Divine love by His Divine wisdom, or out of Divine good by Divine truth, which is also the Word, and that so likewise are people reformed and reborn.<p>This is the spiritual meaning of this statement, because creating symbolically means to reform and regenerate by Divine truth, and the Lord's will symbolizes Divine good.<p>Whether one says Divine good and truth or Divine love and wisdom, the meaning is the same, as all good is connected with love, and all truth with wisdom.<p>In Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom we showed many times that everything in heaven and the church spring from Divine love and wisdom, in fact that the world was created out of them; and we showed too that love and good are connected with the will, and wisdom and truth with the intellect. Thus it is apparent that the Lord's will means His Divine good or love.</p><p>[2] That to create in the Word means to reform and regenerate is apparent from the following passages:<p>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. (<a href="3927/psalms_51_10.htm">Psalms 51:10</a>)<p>You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good... You send forth Your Spirit, they are created. (<a href="3927/psalms_104_28.htm">Psalms 104:28</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_104_30.htm">30</a>)<p>...a people yet to be created will praise Jah. (<a href="3927/psalms_102_18.htm">Psalms 102:18</a>)<p>...behold, I am creating a new heaven and a new earth... ...rejoice forever in what I am creating; ...behold, I shall create Jerusalem an exultation... (<a href="3927/isaiah_65_17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-18</a>)<p>...Jehovah, who created the heavens..., who spread forth the earth..., who gives breath to the people on it, and spirit to those who walk on it. (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>, cf. <a href="3927/isaiah_45_12.htm">45:12</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_45_18.htm">45:18</a>)<p>...thus says Jehovah, your Creator, O Jacob, and your Former, O Israel: ...I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name... Everyone who is called by My name, for My glory I have created him. (<a href="3927/isaiah_43_1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_43_7.htm">7</a>)<p>On the day that you were created they were prepared... You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, till perversity was found in you. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_15.htm">15</a>)<p>The latter is said of the King of Tyre, who symbolizes people who possess intelligence through Divine truth.<p>...that they may see and know, and consider and understand..., that the hand of Jehovah has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created it. (<a href="3927/isaiah_41_19.htm">Isaiah 41:19-20</a>)<p>---------- </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 254</h4><p>254. 'For Thou hast created all things, and by Thy will they exist and have been created' signifies that all things of heaven and the Church have been made and formed, and that [men] are reformed and regenerated, out of Divine Good by means of the Divine Truth that is also the Word. This is the spiritual sense of these words, because by 'to create' is signified to reform and regenerate by means of Divine Truth, and by 'the Lord's will' is signified Divine Good. Whether 'Divine Good and Divine Truth' is said, or 'Divine Love and Divine Wisdom,' it is the same, because all good is of love and all truth is of wisdom. That all things of heaven and the Church exist out of Divine Love and Wisdom, indeed, that the world has been created out of them, has been abundantly shown in ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM also that love and good is of the will, while wisdom and truth is of the understanding. From this it is plain that by 'the Lord's will' is understood His Divine Good or Divine Love.</p><p>[2] That 'to create' in the Word signifies to reform and regenerate, is plain from these places:<p>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit in the midst of me. <a href="3927/psalms_51_10.htm">Psalms 51:10</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_51_12.htm">12</a>].<p>Thou openest Thine hand, they are filled with good, Thou sendest forth Thy spirit, they are created. <a href="3927/psalms_104_28.htm">Psalms 104:28</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_104_30.htm">30</a>.<p>The people that shall be created shall praise Jah. <a href="3927/psalms_102_18.htm">Psalms 102:18</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_102_19.htm">19</a>].<p>Behold, I create a new heaven and a new land, rejoice for ever in that which I am creating: behold, I am going to create Jerusalem an exultation. <a href="3927/isaiah_65_17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-18</a>.<p>Jehovah creating the heavens, stretching out the land, giving soul to the people upon it, and spirit to those walking therein. <a href="3927/isaiah_42_5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_45_12.htm">45:12</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_45_18.htm">18</a>.<p>Thus has Jehovah said, thy Creator, O Jacob, thy Former, O Israel, I have redeemed thee, I have called thee with My Name; everyone called by My Name, in My glory I have created him. <a href="3927/isaiah_43_1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_43_7.htm">7</a>.<p>In the day that thou wast created, they were prepared; thou wast perfect in thy ways in the day that thou wast created, until perversity was found in thee. <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_15.htm">15</a>.<p>These things are concerning the king of Tyre, by whom those are signified who by means of Divine Truth are in intelligence.<p>That they may see, recognise, pay attention to, and understand, that the hand of Jehovah has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created this. <a href="3927/isaiah_41_19.htm">Isaiah 41:19-20</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 254</h4><p>254. For Thou hast created all things, and by Thy will they are, and were created, signifies that all things of heaven and the church were made and formed, and men reformed and regenerated from the Divine love of the Lord through His Divine wisdom, or from the Divine good through the Divine truth, which also is the Word. This is the spiritual sense of these words, because by "creating" is signified to reform and regenerate by the Divine truth, and by "the will of the Lord" is signified the Divine good. Whether you call it the Divine good and the Divine truth, or the Divine love and the Divine wisdom, it is the same, because all good is of love, and all truth is of wisdom. That from the Divine love and the Divine wisdom are all things of heaven and the church, yea and the world itself was created from them is shown in many places in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom; also that love and good is of the will, and wisdom and truth of the understanding; hence it appears, that by "the Lord's will" is meant His Divine good or Divine love.</p><p>[2] That "to create," in the Word, signifies to reform and regenerate, is plain from these passages:<p>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a firm spirit in the midst of me, (<a href="3927/psalms_51_10.htm">Psalms 51:10</a>).<p>Thou openest Thine hand, they are filled with good; Thou sendest forth Thy Spirit; they are created, (<a href="3927/psalms_104_28.htm">Psalms 104:28</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_104_30.htm">30</a>).<p>The people which shall be created shall praise Jah, (<a href="3927/psalms_102_18.htm">Psalms 102:18</a>).<p>Behold, I create a new heaven and a new earth, rejoice for ever in that which I create; behold I create Jerusalem an exultation, (<a href="3927/isaiah_65_17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-18</a>).<p>Jehovah createth the heavens, He that stretcheth out the earth, He giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein, (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_45_12.htm">45:12</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_45_18.htm">18</a>).<p>Thus saith Jehovah thy Creator, O Jacob, thy Former, O Israel; I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by My name; everyone that is called by My name, I have created him in My glory, (<a href="3927/isaiah_43_1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_43_7.htm">7</a>).<p>They were prepared in the day that thou wast created; thou was perfect in thy ways in the day that thou was created, until perversity was found in thee, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_28_13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_28_15.htm">15</a>).<p>These things are concerning the king of Tyre, by whom are signified they who are in intelligence by the Divine truth.<p>That they may see, know, consider, and understand that the hand of Jehovah hath done this, and the Holy one of Israel hath created it, (<a href="3927/isaiah_41_20.htm">Isaiah 41:20</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 254 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>254. "Quia Tu creasti omnia, et per Voluntatem Tuam sunt et creata sunt," significat quod omnia Caeli et Ecclesiae ex Divino Amore Domini per Divinam Sapientiam Ipsius, seu ex Divino Bono per Divinum Verum, quod etiam est Verbum, Facta et formata sint, et quod reformentur et regenerentur. - Hic Sensus spiritualis horum verborum est, quia per "creare" significatur reformare et regenerare per Divinum Verum; et per "Voluntatem Domini" significatur Divinum Bonum; sive dicatur Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum, sive Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia, idem est, quia omne bonum est amoris, et omne verum est sapientiae. Quod ex Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia sint omnia Caeli et Ecclesiae, imo quod ex illis mundus creatus sit, in Sapientia Angelica Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia, multis ostensum est; tum quod Amor et Bonum sit voluntatis, ac Sapientia et Verum sit intellectus; inde patet quod per "Voluntatem Domini" intelligatur Divinum Bonum seu Divinus Amor Ipsius.
