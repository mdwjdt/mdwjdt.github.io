<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第854节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>854.“他们必作神和基督的祭司”表因为他们被主保守在爱之良善中，由此被保守在智慧之真理中。在圣言中，“祭司”表示那些处于爱之良善的人，“君王”表示那些处于智慧之真理的人；所以前面经上说：</p><p>耶稣基督使我们作王和祭司。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.6.htm">1:6</a>）</p><p>还说：</p><p>羔羊叫我们成为君王和祭司，我们要在地上掌权。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.10.htm">5:10</a>）</p><p>显而易见，主不会使人们成为君王和祭司，而是使他们成为处于来自祂的智慧之真理和爱之良善的天使。“君王”表示那些处于来自主的智慧之真理的人，并且主因神性真理而被称为“君王”（<a href="20.htm">20</a>，<a href="483.htm">483</a>，<a href="664.htm">664</a>，<a href="830.htm">830</a>节）。“祭司”之所以表示那些处于来自主的爱之良善的人，是因为主是神性之爱和神性智慧，或也可说，是神性良善和神性真理；主因神性之爱或神性良善而被称为“祭司”，因神性智慧或神性真理而被称为“君王”。正因如此，众天堂被划分为两个国度，即属天国度和属灵国度；属天国度被称为主的祭司国度，因为那里的天使是来自主的神性之爱或神性良善的接受者；属灵国度被称为主的王权国度，因为那里的天使是来自主的神性智慧，或神性真理的接受者；关于这两个国度的详细内容可参看前文（<a href="647.htm">647</a>，<a href="725.htm">725</a>节）。</p><p>我们说过，他们是来自主的神性良善和神性真理的接受者；不过，要知道，他们永远不断地接受它们，因为神性良善与神性真理无法被归给任何天使或世人，以至于成为他自己的，仅仅看似是他的，因为它们是神性；所以，没有哪个天使或世人能凭自己产生任何本身为良善或真理的良善或真理；由此明显可知，他们被主保守在良善与真理中，并且不断被保守其中；因此，若有人进入天堂，并认为良善与真理被归给他成为他自己的，他立刻就从天上被下放，并接受指教。从这些事明显可知，“他们必作神和基督的祭司”表示因为他们被主保守在爱之良善中，由此被保守在智慧之真理中。</p><p>在圣言中，“祭司”表示诸如处于来自主的爱之良善的人；这一点从其中的许多经文明显看出来；不过，由于它们在伦敦出版的《天堂的奥秘》一书已被引用，故我在此仅从该书引用以下内容：祭司代表主的神性良善（<a href="../ac/2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="../ac/6148.htm">6148</a>节）；祭司的职分代表主拯救的工，因为这拯救之工来自其神性之爱的神性良善（<a href="../ac/9809.htm">9809</a>节）；亚伦和他儿子，以及利未人的祭司职分代表主依次的拯救之工（<a href="../ac/10017.htm">10017</a>节）；因此，“祭司”和“祭司的职分”表示来自主的爱之良善（<a href="../ac/9806.htm">9806</a>，<a href="../ac/9809.htm">9809</a>节）；“耶稣”和“基督”这两个名字分别表示主的祭司职分和祂的王权（<a href="../ac/3404.htm">3404</a>，<a href="../ac/3405.htm">3405</a>，<a href="../ac/3009.htm">3009</a>节）；祭司管理教会事务，君王管理世俗事务（<a href="../ac/10793.htm">10793</a>节）；祭司要教导真理，并通过这些真理引向良善，因而引向主（<a href="../ac/10794.htm">10794</a>节）；他们不会声称自己对世人的灵魂拥有权柄（<a href="../ac/10795.htm">10795</a>节）；祭司由于神圣事物而拥有尊严，但不可将这尊严归给自己，而是归给主，神圣事物唯独来自主，因为祭司职分并不在这个人里面，而是附在这个人身上（<a href="../ac/10796.htm">10796</a>，<a href="../ac/10797.htm">10797</a>节）；在圣言中，不承认主的祭司具有反面意义（<a href="../ac/3670.htm">3670</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 854</h4><p>854. But they shall be priests of God and of Christ. This symbolically means, because the people described are kept by the Lord in the goodness of love and so in truths of wisdom.<p>Priests in the Word mean people who possess the goodness of love, and kings people who possess truths of wisdom. So we are told above, "Jesus Christ makes us kings and priests" (<a href="3927/revelation_1_6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>), and also that the Lamb has "made us kings and priests" that we may "reign on the earth" (<a href="3927/revelation_5_10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>). And it can clearly be seen that the Lord will not make people kings and priests, but that He will make angels of those who possess truths of wisdom and the goodness of love from Him.<p>That kings mean people who possess truths of wisdom from the Lord, and that the Lord is called a king by virtue of His Divine truth, may be seen in nos. <a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="483.htm">483</a>, <a href="664.htm">664</a>, <a href="830.htm">830</a> above. And priests mean people who possess the goodness of love from the Lord, because the Lord embodies Divine love and Divine wisdom, or to say the same thing, Divine goodness and Divine truth. Owing to His Divine love or Divine goodness, then, the Lord is called a priest, and owing to His Divine wisdom or Divine truth He is called a king.<p>That is why the heavens have been divided into two kingdoms, celestial and spiritual, and why the celestial kingdom is called the Lord's priestly kingdom, inasmuch as the angels in that kingdom are recipient vessels of Divine love or Divine goodness from the Lord; and why the spiritual kingdom is called the Lord's royal kingdom, inasmuch as the angels in it are recipient vessels of Divine wisdom or Divine truth from the Lord. But more on these two kingdoms may be seen in nos. <a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="725.htm">725</a> above.</p><p>[2] We say that angels are recipient vessels of Divine goodness and Divine truth from the Lord, but it should be known that they are recipients perpetually, for no angel or mortal can so assimilate Divine goodness or Divine truth as to make it his own, but only to have them appear as though they were his own, because they are Divine. Consequently no angel or mortal can produce any good or truth that is good or true in itself. It is apparent, then, from this that they are kept in goodness and truth by the Lord, and are continually kept in them. If someone comes into heaven, therefore, and thinks that goodness or truth is so assimilated by him as to be his own, he is immediately sent down from heaven and instructed.<p>It can now be seen from this that the people's being priests of God and of Christ symbolically means, because they are kept by the Lord in the goodness of love and so in truths of wisdom.</p><p>[3] That priests in the Word mean people who possess the goodness of love from the Lord can be seen from many passages in it; but because I cited them in Arcana Coelestia (The Secrets of Heaven), published in London, I wish only to present from there the following:<p>That priests represented the Lord with respect to Divine good (nos. <a href="../ac/2015.htm">2015</a> <a href="../ac/6148.htm">6148</a>).<p>That the priesthood was representative of the Lord with respect to His work of salvation, because it proceeded from the Divine goodness of His Divine love (no. <a href="../ac/9809.htm">9809</a>).<p>That the priesthood of Aaron and his sons and of the Levites was representative of the Lord's work of salvation in a sequential progression (no. <a href="../ac/10017.htm">10017</a>).<p>That priests and the priesthood therefore symbolize the goodness of love from the Lord (nos. <a href="../ac/9806.htm">9806</a> <a href="../ac/9809.htm">9809</a>).<p>That the two names, Jesus and Christ, symbolize both the Lord's priestliness and His royalty (nos. <a href="../ac/3004.htm">3004</a>, <a href="../ac/3005.htm">3005</a>, <a href="../ac/3009.htm">3009</a>).<p>That priests are responsible for matters having to do with the church, and kings for ones having to do with the civil state (no. <a href="../ac/10793.htm">10793</a>).<p>That priests are to teach truths and lead by them to goodness and so to the Lord (no. <a href="../ac/10794.htm">10794</a>).<p>That they are not to claim for themselves any authority over people's souls (no. <a href="../ac/10795.htm">10795</a>).<p>That priests are due respect because of their sacred functions, but that they are not to attribute the respect to themselves, but to the Lord from whom alone those sacred functions emanate. For the priesthood does not lie in the person, but is attached to the person (nos. <a href="../ac/10796.htm">10796</a>, <a href="../ac/10797.htm">10797</a>).<p>That priests in the Word who do not acknowledge the Lord symbolize the opposite (no. <a href="../ac/3670.htm">3670</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 854</h4><p>854. 'But they shall be priests of God and Christ' signifies because they are kept by the Lord in the good of love and consequently in the truths of wisdom. By 'priests' in the Word are understood those who are in the good of love, and by 'kings' those who are in the truths of wisdom; and therefore it is said above:<p>Jesus Christ makes us kings and priests. <a href="3927/revelation_1_6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; and also:<p>The Lamb made us kings and priests so that we may reign over the land. <a href="3927/revelation_5_10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>; and it can be clearly seen that the Lord is not going to make men kings and priests, but that He is going to make angels of those who will be in the truths of wisdom and the good of love from Himself. That by 'kings' are understood those who are in the truths of wisdom from the Lord, and that the Lord is termed 'King' by reason of Divine Truth, may be seen above (<a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="483.htm">483</a>, <a href="664.htm">664</a>, <a href="830.htm">830</a>); but that by 'priests' are understood those who are in the good of love from the Lord is because the Lord is Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, or what is the same, Divine Good and Divine Truth, and the Lord by reason of Divine Love or Divine Good is called 'Priest' and by reason of Divine Wisdom or Divine Truth is called 'King.' This is why there are two kingdoms into which the heavens are distinguished, a celestial and a spiritual; and the celestial kingdom is called the Lord's priestly kingdom, for the angels there are recipients of Divine Love or Divine Good from the Lord; and the spiritual kingdom is called the Lord's regal kingdom, for the angels there are recipients of Divine Wisdom or Divine Truth from the Lord. But more concerning these two kingdoms may be seen above (<a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="725.htm">725</a>).</p><p>[2] It is said that they are recipients of Divine Good and of Divine Truth from the Lord; but it should be known that they are perpetually receiving, for Divine Good and Divine Truths cannot be appropriated by any angel or man so as to be his but only so as to appear as his, for they are Divine. Therefore no angel or man is able from himself to produce anything good and true that in itself is good and true. From this it is plain that they are kept in what is good and true by the Lord, and that they are continually being [so] kept. Consequently if anyone comes into heaven and thinks that good and truth have been appropriated by him as his own, he is there and then sent down out of heaven and instructed. From these considerations it can now be established that by 'they shall be priests of God and Christ' is signified because they are kept by the Lord in the good of love and consequently in the truths of wisdom.</p><p>[3] That by 'priests' in the Word are understood those who are in the good of love from the Lord can be established from many passages there; and because these have been quoted in ARCANA CAELESTIA published at London, I wish only to quote from it the following statements:<p>That priests represented the Lord as to Divine Good (<a href="../ac/2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="../ac/6148.htm">6148</a>).<p>That the priesthood was representative of the Lord as to the work of salvation, because this was out of the Divine Good of His Divine Love (<a href="../ac/9809.htm">9809</a>).<p>That the priesthood of Aaron, his sons, and the Levites was representative of the Lord's work of salvation in successive order (<a href="../ac/10017.htm">10017</a>).<p>That therefore by priests and the priesthood is signified the good of love from the Lord (<a href="../ac/9806.htm">9806</a>, <a href="../ac/9809.htm">9809</a>).<p>That by the two names, Jesus and Christ, is signified both the priestly and the regal [office] of the Lord (<a href="../ac/3004.htm">3004-3005</a>, <a href="../ac/3009.htm">3009</a>).<p>That priests administer ecclesiastical matters and kings civil matters (<a href="../ac/10793.htm">10793</a>).<p>That priests shall teach truths, and by means of them lead to good and thus to the Lord (<a href="../ac/10794.htm">10794</a>).<p>That they shall not claim to themselves authority over men souls (<a href="../ac/10795.htm">10795</a>).<p>That there shall be respect for priests for the sake of holy things, but that they shall not attribute the respect to themselves but to the Lord from Whom Only holy things exist, because the priesthood is not in the person but adjoined to the person (<a href="../ac/10796.htm">10796</a>, <a href="../ac/10797.htm">10797</a>).<p>That priests who do not acknowledge the Lord have in the Word the signification of contrary things (<a href="../ac/3670.htm">3670</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 854</h4><p>854. But they shall be priests of God and of Christ, signifies because they are kept by the Lord in the good of love and thence in the truths of wisdom. By "priests" in the Word are meant they who are in the good of love, and by "kings" they who are in the truths of wisdom; wherefore it is said above:<p>Jesus Christ hath made us kings and priests, (<a href="3927/revelation_1_6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>);<p>and likewise:<p>The Lamb hath made us kings and priests, that we may reign over the earth, (<a href="3927/revelation_5_10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>).<p>And it may be clearly seen that the Lord will not make men kings and priests, but that He will make them angels who are in the truths of wisdom, and in the good of love from Him. That by "kings" are meant they who are in the truths of wisdom from the Lord, and that the Lord is called "king" from the Divine truth, may be seen above, (<a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="483.htm">483</a>, <a href="664.htm">664</a>, <a href="830.htm">830</a>). The reason why by "priests" are meant those who are in the good of love from the Lord, is because the Lord is the Divine love and the Divine wisdom, or what is the same, the Divine good and the Divine truth; and the Lord from the Divine love or the Divine good, is called "priest," and from the Divine wisdom or the Divine truth, is called "king." Hence it is, that there are two kingdoms, into which the heavens are distinguished, the celestial and the spiritual; and the celestial kingdom is called the Lord's priestly kingdom, for the angels there are recipients of the Divine love or the Divine good from the Lord, and the spiritual kingdom is called the Lord's royal kingdom, for the angels there are the recipients of the Divine wisdom or the Divine truth from the Lord; but more may be seen concerning these two kingdoms above, (<a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="725.htm">725</a>).</p><p>[2] It is said that they are recipients of the Divine good and the Divine truth from the Lord; but it is to be known that they are perpetually receiving them, for the Divine good and the Divine truth cannot be appropriated by any angel or man, so as to be his own, but only that they may appear to be his, because they are Divine; wherefore no angel or man can produce from himself anything good or true, which in itself is good and true; from which it is evident that they are kept in good and truth by the Lord, and this continually; for which reason, if anyone comes into heaven, and thinks that good and truth are appropriated to him as his own, he is immediately let down from heaven and instructed. From these things it may now appear, that by "they shall be priests of God and of Christ," is signified because they were kept by the Lord in the good of love, and thereby in the truths of wisdom.</p><p>[3] That by priests in the Word are meant such as are in the good of love from the Lord, may appear from many passages therein, but as they are adduced in the Arcana Coelestia published at London, I will only quote therefrom the following: "That priests represented the Lord as to the Divine good, (<a href="../ac/2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="../ac/6148.htm">6148</a>). That the priesthood was a representative of the Lord as to the work of salvation, because this was from the Divine good of His Divine love, (<a href="../ac/9809.htm">9809</a>) That the priesthood of Aaron, of his sons, and of the Levites, was a representative of the Lord's work of salvation in successive order, (<a href="../ac/10017.htm">10017</a>). That therefore by "priests" and by "the priesthood" is signified the good of love from the Lord, (<a href="../ac/9806.htm">9806</a>, <a href="../ac/9809.htm">9809</a>). That by the two names, "Jesus" and "Christ," is signified as well the priesthood as the royalty of the Lord, (<a href="../ac/3004.htm">3004-3005</a>, <a href="../ac/3009.htm">3009</a>). That priests administer ecclesiastical affairs, and kings civil affairs, (<a href="../ac/10793.htm">10793</a>). That priests are to teach truths, and by these lead to good, and thus to the Lord, (<a href="../ac/10794.htm">10794</a>). That they are not to claim power to themselves over the souls of men, (<a href="../ac/10795.htm">10795</a>). That priests ought to have dignity on account of holy things, but that they ought not to attribute the dignity to themselves, but to the Lord, from whom alone are holy things, because the priesthood is not in the person, but is adjoined to the person, (<a href="../ac/10796.htm">10796-10797</a>). That priests who do not acknowledge the Lord have in the Word a contrary signification, (<a href="../ac/3670.htm">3670</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 854 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>854. "Sed erunt sacerdotes Dei et Christi," significat quia a Domino tenentur in bono amoris et inde in veris sapientiae. -Per "sacerdotes" in Verbo intelliguntur qui in bono amoris sunt, et per "reges" qui in veris sapientiae; quare dicitur supra, <p>Jesus Christus fecit nos "reges et sacerdotes," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_854/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_1_6" target=_top>Apocalypsis 1:6</a>);<p>et quoque, <p>Agnus fecit nos "reges et sacerdotes, ut regnemus super terra," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_854/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_5_10" target=_top>Apocalypsis 5:10</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>et manifeste videri potest, quod Dominus non facturus sit homines reges et sacerdotes, sed quod facturus sit angelos illos qui in veris sapientiae et in bono amoris ab Ipso erunt. Quod per "reges" intelligantur qui in veris sapientiae a Domino sunt, et quod Dominus dicatur "Rex" ex Divino Vero, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_854/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_20" target=_top>20</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_854/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_483" target=_top>483</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_854/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_664" target=_top>664</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_854/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_830" target=_top>830</a>). Quod autem per "sacerdotes" intelligantur qui in bono amoris a Domino sunt, est quia Dominus est Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia, seu quod idem, Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum; et Dominus ex Divino Amore seu Divino Bono vocatur "Sacerdos," et ex Divina Sapientia seu Divino Vero vocatur "Rex." Inde est quod sint bina Regna, in quae Caeli distincti sunt, caeleste et spirituale: et Regnum caeleste vocatur Regnum Sacerdotale Domini, sunt enim angeli ibi recipientes Divini Amoris seu Divini Boni a Domino; et Regnum spirituale vocatur Regnum Regium Domini, sunt enim angeli ibi recipientes Divinae Sapientiae seu Divini Veri, e Domino; sed plura de binis his Regnis, videantur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_854/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_647" target=_top>647</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_854/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_725" target=_top>725</a>). Dicitur quod sint recipientes Divini Boni et Divini Veri a Domino; at sciendum est, quod sint perpetuo recipientes, nam Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum non possunt appropriari alicui angelo et homini ut sint ejus, solum ut appareant sicut ejus, quia sunt Divina; quare non potest aliquis angelus aut homo a se producere aliquod bonum aut verum quod in se est bonum et verum; ex quo patet quod teneantur in bono et vero a Domino, et quod continue teneantur; quare si quis in Caelum venit, et cogitat quod bonum et verum sint ei appropriata ut sua, illico demittitur Caelo et instruitur. Ex his nunc constare potest, quod per "erunt sacerdotes Dei et Christi" significetur quia a Domino tenentur in bono amoris et inde in veris sapientiae. <p>Quod per "sacerdotes" in Verbo intelligantur qui in bono amoris a Domino sunt, constare potest a multis locis ibi; quae quia allata sunt in Arcanis Caelestibus Londini editis, volo solum exinde afferre haec sequentia :- <p>Quod Sacerdotes repraesentaverint Dominum quoad Divinum Bonum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_854/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_2015" target=_top>2015</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_854/swedenborg_arcana-coelestia_6148" target=_top>6148</a>).
