<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>364.“数”在属灵意义上表示知道品质或性质，因为在圣言中，“数目”或“数字”并非表示数字，而是表示其品质或性质（10节）；因此在这段经文中，“一大群人，没有人能数过来”在属世意义上，也就是照字面来理解，意思是：有一个如此巨大的人群；但在属灵意义上，意思是：除了唯独主之外，没有人知道他们的品质或性质。因为主的天堂由无数社群组成，这些社群照着总体上情感的多样性而有所区分；每个社群里的所有人以同样的方式而有具体的区分。唯独主知道每个个体的情感品质或性质，并照此依次安排所有人。天使将“数”理解为知道这种品质或性质。以下经文中的数（经上或译为数算，或数点，或点）所表相同：</p><p>当伯沙撒用耶路撒冷殿中的器皿饮酒时，只见墙上写着，数算，数算。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但5.2.htm">5:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但5.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但5.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但5.25.htm">25</a>）</p><p>我必进入阴间的门，被数算出来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛38.10.htm">38:10</a>）</p><p>列国哄嚷的声音，这是万军之耶和华点齐军队，预备打仗。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.4.htm">13:4</a>）</p><p>看谁创造这些，按数目领出它们的万象。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.26.htm">40:26</a>）</p><p>耶和华数点星宿的数目。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗147.4.htm">147:4</a>）</p><p>必有羊群从数点的人的手下经过。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.13.htm">33:13</a>）</p><p>我的脚步被数点。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯14.16.htm">14:16</a>）</p><p>锡安和耶路撒冷的房屋和城楼被数点。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.9.htm">22:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.10.htm">10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.18.htm">33:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.19.htm">19</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗48.11.htm">48:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗48.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>“数点”或“数算”是指知道品质或性质。从“数目”和“数算”（或“数点”）的含义明显可知，为何大卫数点百姓或以色列支派招来惩罚，为何他对先知迦得说，他做这事犯了大罪（撒母耳记下24章）。而且，为何当摩西按众支派数点百姓时，经上要求：</p><p>数点时，每个人都要为自己的灵魂把赎价奉给耶和华，免得数他们的时候在他们中间有灾殃。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.12.htm">30:12</a>）</p><p>原因在于，“数算或数点”表示就其属灵状态，因而就“以色列十二支派”所表示的教会状态而言，他们的品质或性质，这些唯有主知道。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 364</h4><p>364. To number in the spiritual sense means, symbolically, to know the character of something, because a number in the Word does not symbolically mean the number, but the character of a thing (no. <a href="10.htm">10</a>). Consequently the reference here to "a great multitude, which no one could number," means in the natural sense, literally, that there was such an immense multitude, but in the spiritual sense that no one but the Lord alone knows their character. For the Lord's heaven consists of countless societies - societies distinguished according to the varieties of their affections in general, and likewise of all the inhabitants in each society in particular. The Lord alone knows the character of everyone's affection and arranges all people in an order in accordance with it.<p>To know this character is what angels mean by numbering, and likewise what is meant in the Word in the following places, as when Belshazzar drank wine from vessels of the temple in Jerusalem, and the writing appeared on the wall, saying,<p>You have been numbered. You have been numbered. (<a href="3927/daniel_5_2.htm">Daniel 5:2</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_5_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_5_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_5_25.htm">25</a>)<p>...I shall go to the gates of hell; I have been numbered... (<a href="3927/isaiah_38_10.htm">Isaiah 38:10</a>)<p>A tumultuous noise of the kingdoms...! Jehovah of hosts is numbering the army for war. (<a href="3927/isaiah_13_4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>)<p>...see who has created these things, who has brought out by number their host. (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>)<p>(Jehovah who) numbers the host of the stars... (<a href="3927/psalms_147_4.htm">Psalms 147:4</a>)<p>...the flocks shall again pass under the hands of him who numbers them. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_33_13.htm">Jeremiah 33:13</a>)<p>...my steps are numbered. (<a href="3927/job_14_16.htm">Job 14:16</a>)<p>The houses and towers of Zion and Jerusalem were numbered (<a href="3927/isaiah_22_9.htm">Isaiah 22:9-10</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_33_18.htm">33:18-19</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_48_11.htm">Psalms 48:11-13</a>). Numbering stands for knowing the character of.<p>From the symbolic meaning of numbers and numbering, it can be seen why David was faced with punishment for numbering the people, the tribes of Israel, and why he said to the prophet Gad, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done" (<a href="3927/2-samuel_24_1.htm">2 Samuel 24</a>). Moreover, why, when Moses numbered the people and all its tribes, the command was given for each man to "give a ransom for his soul to Jehovah when they were numbered, that that there might be no plague among them when they were numbered" (<a href="3927/exodus_30_12.htm">Exodus 30:12</a>). The reason was that numbering symbolized knowing the character of the people in respect to their spiritual state, thus in respect to the state of the church, meant by the twelve tribes of Israel, which only the Lord knew. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 364</h4><p>364. 'To number' in the spiritual sense signifies to have a knowledge of the quality, because a 'number' in the Word does not signify a number but the quality of a thing (<a href="10.htm">10</a>). Here therefore by the statement 'a great crowd which no one could number' is understood in the natural sense, in accordance with the words, that there was such a huge crowd; but in the spiritual sense is understood that no one except the Only Lord has a knowledge of their qualities For the Lord's heaven consists of innumerable societies and the societies have been distinguished in accordance with the varieties of affections in general, in like manner as all have been distinguished in any one society in its specific case. The Only Lord gets to know the quality of the affection of each individual, and He disposes all into an order in accordance therewith. To have a knowledge of this quality is what the angels understand by 'to number'; in like manner in the Word, in these places:<p>When Belshazzar drank wine out of the vessels of the Jerusalem temple, there was written upon the wall, Thou hast been numbered, thou hast been numbered. <a href="3927/daniel_5_2.htm">Daniel 5:2</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_5_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_5_25.htm">25</a>.<p>I am going away to the gates of hell, I have been numbered. <a href="3927/isaiah_38_10.htm">Isaiah 38:10</a>.<p>The voice of the tumult of the kingdoms, Jehovah Zebaoth numbers the host of war. <a href="3927/isaiah_13_4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>.<p>See Who has created these, Who brings out their host by number. <a href="3927/isaiah_40_26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>.<p>Jehovah Who numbers the host of the stars. <a href="3927/psalms_147_4.htm">Psalms 147:4</a>.<p>The flocks shall pass over again close by the hand of him who. <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_13.htm">Jeremiah 33:13</a>.<p>My steps have been numbered, <a href="3927/job_14_16.htm">Job 14:16</a>.<p>The houses and towers of Zion and Jerusalem have been numbered. <a href="3927/isaiah_22_9.htm">Isaiah 22:9-10</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_33_18.htm">33:18-19</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_48_1.htm">Psalms 48:1-13</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_48_12.htm">12-14</a>].<p>'To number' [stands] for to have knowledge of their qualities. From the signification of 'numbers' and 'to number' it can be established why David had punishments announced to him on account of the numbering of the people or the tribes of Israel, and why he said to the prophet Gad, 'I have sinned greatly in what I have done' (<a href="3927/2-samuel_24_1.htm">2 Samuel 24</a>). And why, when the people was numbered by Moses as to all the tribes thereof, it was commanded that:<p>Each one should give an expiation for his soul to Jehovah in the numbering, so that there might be no plague among them in numbering them, <a href="3927/exodus_30_12.htm">Exodus 30:12</a>.<p>This was because 'to number' used to signify to have knowledge of their quality as to the spiritual state, thus as to the state of the Church understood by the twelve tribes of Israel, which the Only Lord knows, </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 364</h4><p>364. "To number," in the spiritual sense, signifies to know the quality, because a "number" in the Word does not signify a number, but its quality, (<a href="10.htm">10</a>); in this passage therefore, by "a great multitude which no one could number," in the natural sense, is meant what the words import, that there was an immense multitude; but in the spiritual sense, is meant that no one but the Lord alone knows their quality. For the Lord's heaven consists of innumerable societies, and these societies are distinguished according to the varieties of affections in general; in like manner all in each society, are distinguished in particular. The Lord alone knows the quality of the affection of each individual, and disposes all in order according thereto. By "numbering," the angels understand, to know this quality. The same is meant, in the Word, in these passages:<p>When Belshazzar drank wine out of the vessels of the temple of Jerusalem, there was written upon the wall, Thou art numbered, thou art numbered, (<a href="3927/daniel_5_2.htm">Daniel 5:2</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_5_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_5_25.htm">25</a>).<p>I shall go to the gates of hell, I am numbered, (<a href="3927/isaiah_38_10.htm">Isaiah 38:10</a>).<p>A voice of the tumult of the kingdoms, Jehovah of hosts numbereth the host of war, (<a href="3927/isaiah_13_4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>).<p>See, who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number, (<a href="3927/isaiah_40_26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>).<p>Jehovah who numbereth the host of the stars, (<a href="3927/psalms_147_4.htm">Psalms 147:4</a>).<p>The flocks shall pass again under the hands of him that numbereth, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_33_13.htm">Jeremiah 33:13</a>).<p>My steps are numbered, (<a href="3927/job_14_16.htm">Job 14:16</a>).<p>The houses and towers of Zion and of Jerusalem are numbered, (<a href="3927/isaiah_22_9.htm">Isaiah 22:9-10</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_33_18.htm">33:18-19</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_48_12.htm">Psalms 48:12-14</a>).<p>To "number" is to know the quality. From the signification of "numbers" and of "numbering," it may appear why punishment was denounced against David for numbering the people or the tribes of Israel, and why he said to the prophet Gad:<p>I have sinned greatly in what I have done, (<a href="3927/2-samuel_24_1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1</a>, to the end).<p>And why, when the people were numbered by Moses as to all their tribes, it was commanded that:<p>Everyone should give an expiation of his soul to Jehovah in numbering, that there be no plague among them in numbering them, (<a href="3927/exodus_30_12.htm">Exodus 30:12</a>).<p>The reason was, because "to number" signified to know their quality as to their spiritual state, thus as to the state of the church meant by "the twelve tribes of Israel," which the Lord alone knows. </p>
