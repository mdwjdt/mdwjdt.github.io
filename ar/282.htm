<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第282节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>282.“从各支派、各舌、各民、各族中”表那些在教会或具有某种宗教信仰，并且教义上处于真理，生活上处于良善的人都已被主救赎。“支派”表示教会的宗教信仰；“舌”表示教会的教义，对此，我们就会说明；“民”表示处于教义真理的人，抽象而言，表示教义的真理（<a href="483.htm">483</a>节），“族”表示处于生活良善的人，抽象而言，表示生活的良善（<a href="483.htm">483</a>节）。由此明显可知，“从各支派、各舌、各民、各族中”这句话表示这类事物，如前所述（也可参看<a href="627.htm">627</a>节）。</p><p>下面证明在灵义上，“舌”表示教会或任何宗教信仰的教义。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>我的舌头要述说你的公义，终日赞美你。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗35.28.htm">35:28</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗71.24.htm">71:24</a>）</p><p>那时，瘸子必像鹿一般跳跃，哑巴的舌头必歌唱，旷野必涌出大水。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.6.htm">35:6</a>）</p><p>口吃的人说话流畅。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛32.4.htm">32:4</a>）</p><p>在上述经文中，表面上看，“舌”是指言语，但在灵义上，则是指所说的话，也就是他们将要从主所享有的教义真理。同样：</p><p>我指着自己起誓，万膝必向我跪拜，众舌必凭我起誓。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.23.htm">45:23</a>）</p><p>我必将万族万舌聚来，他们要来瞻仰我的荣耀。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.18.htm">66:18</a>）</p><p>在那些日子，必有十人从列族诸舌中出来，拉住一个犹太人的衣襟说，我们要与你们同去，因为我们听说神与你们同在了。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.23.htm">8:23</a>）</p><p>这也论及在教义真理上皈依主。</p><p>但在反面意义上，“舌”表示虚假的教义。如以下经文：</p><p>你要隐藏他们在帐棚里，免遭口舌的争闹。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗31.20.htm">31:20</a>）</p><p>我必使一民族来攻击你，他们的舌你不晓得。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.15.htm">5:15</a>）</p><p>你奉差遣不是舌头难懂的民那里去。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.5.htm">3:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>舌头结巴的民。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.19.htm">33:19</a>）</p><p>要知道，“舌”作为器官表示教义，但作为言语，则表示宗教信仰。</p><p>人若知道“舌”表示教义，就会明白财主在地狱对亚伯拉罕所说的话是什么意思：打发拉撒路来，用指尖蘸点水，凉凉我的舌头，因为我在这火焰里，极其痛苦。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.24.htm">16:24</a>）</p><p>此处“水”表示真理，“舌”表示教义。财主受苦是因为虚假，而不是因为火焰。事实上，在地狱，没有人在火焰中，那里的火焰是对虚假之爱的表象，而大火是对邪恶之爱的表象。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 282</h4><p>282. "Out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation." This symbolically means that the Lord has redeemed those in the church or in any other religion who are impelled by truths in respect to their doctrine and by goods in respect to their life.<p>Tribes mean, symbolically, the church in respect to religion. Tongues symbolize its doctrine, as we will see presently. People mean, symbolically, people impelled by doctrinal truths, and abstractly doctrinal truths themselves (no. <a href="483.htm">483</a>). And nations mean, symbolically, people who are impelled by goods of life, and abstractly goods of life themselves (no. <a href="483.htm">483</a>). It is apparent from this that every tribe and tongue and people and nation has the symbolic meaning stated, as it does also in no. <a href="627.htm">627</a>.</p><p>[2] We will now confirm here that tongues in the spiritual sense symbolize the doctrine possessed by a church and by every religion. This is apparent from the following:<p>My tongue ponders Your righteousness, Your praise all the day long. (<a href="3927/psalms_35_28.htm">Psalms 35:28</a>)<p>My tongue shall ponder Your righteousness all the day long. (<a href="3927/psalms_71_24.htm">Psalms 71:24</a>)<p>Then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the dumb sing. For waters shall burst forth in the wilderness... (<a href="3927/isaiah_35_6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>)<p>...the tongue of stammerers will be swift to speak... (<a href="3927/isaiah_32_4.htm">Isaiah 32:4</a>)<p>It seems as though tongue there means speech, but in the spiritual sense it means that which is spoken, which is the doctrinal truth that they will have from the Lord.<p>So likewise:<p>I have sworn... that to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue swear an oath. (<a href="3927/isaiah_45_23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>)<p>The time will come to gather all nations and tongues, that they may come and see My glory. (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_18.htm">Isaiah 66:18</a>)<p>In those days ten men from all the tongues of the nations shall take hold of the sleeve of a Jewish man, saying, "We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you." (<a href="3927/zechariah_8_23.htm">Zechariah 8:23</a>)<p>These passages describe as well the Lord's conversion of the nations to doctrinal truth.</p><p>[3] On the other hand, in the following places tongues in an opposite sense symbolize doctrinal falsities:<p>A smooth-tongued man shall not continue to exist in the land. (<a href="3927/psalms_140_11.htm">Psalms 140:11</a>)<p>You hide them... in Your tabernacle from the strife of tongues. (<a href="3927/psalms_31_20.htm">Psalms 31:20</a>)<p>...I will bring a nation against you... whose language you do not know... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_5_15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>)<p>(To be sent to peoples heavy in tongue.) (<a href="3927/ezekiel_3_5.htm">Ezekiel 3:5-6</a>). (To a people barbarous in tongue.) (<a href="3927/isaiah_33_19.htm">Isaiah 33:19</a>).<p>It should be known that the tongue as an organ symbolizes doctrine, while as speech it symbolizes also religion.</p><p>[4] Someone who knows that the tongue symbolizes doctrine can understand what is symbolically meant by the plea of the rich man in hell to Abraham to send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool his tongue, to keep him from being tormented in the flame (<a href="3927/luke_16_24.htm">Luke 16:24</a>). The water symbolizes truth, and the tongue doctrine, by whose falsities the rich man was being tormented, and not by any flame. For no one in hell is on fire, but a flame there is how a love of falsity appears, and fire how a love of evil appears. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 282</h4><p>282. 'Out of every tribe and tongue, and people and nation' signifies that those who, in the Church or any religion, are in truths as to doctrine and in goods as to life have been redeemed by the Lord. By 'tribe' is signified the Church as to religion; by 'tongue' is signified its doctrine, of which [more will be said] presently; by 'people' are signified those who are in truths of doctrine, and abstractly the truths of doctrine (<a href="483.htm">483</a>); and by 'nations' are signified those who are in goods of life, and abstractly the goods of life (<a href="483.htm">483</a>). It is plain from these considerations that by 'out of every tribe and tongue, and people and nation' such things as have been said are signified, as also (<a href="627.htm">627</a>).</p><p>[2] Here it shall now be confirmed that by 'tongue' in the spiritual sense is signified the doctrine that is of the Church, and that of any religion. This is plain from these passages:<p>My tongue shall meditate on Thy justice, on Thy praise all the day. <a href="3927/psalms_71_24.htm">Psalms 71:24</a>.<p>Then shall the lame man leap as a stag, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing, for in the wilderness shall waters break out. <a href="3927/isaiah_35_6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>.<p>The tongue of the stammerers shall be swift to speak. <a href="3927/isaiah_32_4.htm">Isaiah 32:4</a>.<p>It appears there as if by 'tongue' speech may be understood, but in the spiritual sense that which is spoken is understood and this is all the truth of doctrine which will be with them from the Lord. In like manner:<p>I have, sworn that unto Me every knee is going to bow, and every tongue is going to swear. <a href="3927/isaiah_45_23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>.<p>The time shall come for gathering all nations and tongues, that they may come and see My glory, <a href="3927/isaiah_66_18.htm">Isaiah 66:18</a>.<p>In those days ten men out of all the tongues of the nations shall take hold of the skirt of a man that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, because We have heard God is with you, <a href="3927/zechariah_8_23.htm">Zechariah 8:23</a>.<p>These passages also are concerned with the conversion of the nations by the Lord to what is true of doctrine.</p><p>[3] By 'tongues' in the opposite sense, however, are signified untrue doctrines, in these passages:<p>A man of tongue <sup>1</sup>shall not continue to exist in the land. <a href="3927/psalms_140_11.htm">Psalms 140:11</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_140_12.htm">12</a>].<p>Thou hidest them in Thy tabernacle from the strife of tongues. <a href="3927/psalms_31_20.htm">Psalms 31:20</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_31_21.htm">21</a>].<p>I will bring upon you a nation, whose tongue thou shalt not recognise. <a href="3927/jeremiah_5_15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15-16</a>.<p>Sent to peoples harsh of tongue. <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_5.htm">Ezekiel 3:5-6</a>.<p>To a people barbarous of tongue. <a href="3927/isaiah_33_19.htm">Isaiah 33:19</a>.<p>It is to be known that 'tongue' as an organ signifies doctrine, while as speech it also signifies religion.</p><p>[4] He who knows that 'tongue' signifies doctrine is able to understand what is signified by the words of the rich man in hell to Abraham, that he would send Lazarus that he might dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool his tongue, that he should not be tormented in the flame. <a href="3927/luke_16_24.htm">Luke 16:24</a>.<p>'Water' signifies truth, and 'tongue' doctrine, by the untruths of which he was tormented, and not by a flame; for no one in hell is in a flame, but the flame there is the appearance of a love of what is untrue and fire is the appearance of a love of evil.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;AV 'an evil speaker.' </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 282</h4><p>282. Out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation, signifies that they in the church or in any religion, who are in truths as to doctrine, and in goods as to life, are redeemed by the Lord. By "tribe" is signified the church as to religion; by "tongue" is signified its doctrine, of which we shall speak presently; by "people" are signified they who are in truths of doctrine, and, abstractly, truths of doctrine, (<a href="483.htm">483</a>); and by "nation" are signified they who are in the goods of life, and, abstractly, the goods of life, (<a href="483.htm">483</a>); from hence it appears that by these words, "Out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation," such things are signified as were said above (see also <a href="627.htm">627</a>).</p><p>[2] It shall now be proved that "tongue," in the spiritual sense, signifies the doctrine of the church, or of any religion; this is evident from the following passages:<p>My tongue also shall meditate of Thy justice, all the day Thy praise, (<a href="3927/psalms_35_28.htm">Psalms 35:28</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_71_24.htm">71:24</a>).<p>Then shall the lame leap as a stag, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing, for in the wilderness shall waters break out, (<a href="3927/isaiah_35_6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>).<p>The tongue of the stammerers shall be swift to speak, (<a href="3927/isaiah_32_4.htm">Isaiah 32:4</a>).<p>It appears as if in these instances, by "tongue" was meant speech, but in the spiritual sense that which is spoken is meant, which is truth of doctrine, which they will have from the Lord. In like manner:<p>I have sworn that unto Me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall swear, (<a href="3927/isaiah_45_23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>).<p>The time shall come to gather all nations and tongues, that they may come and see My glory, (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_18.htm">Isaiah 66:18</a>).<p>In those days ten men out of all the tongues of the nations, shall take hold of the skirt of a man that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you, (<a href="3927/zechariah_8_23.htm">Zechariah 8:23</a>).<p>This is also concerning the conversion of the Gentiles by the Lord to the truth of doctrine.</p><p>[3] But by "tongues," in the opposite sense, are signified false doctrines in the following passages:<p>A man of tongue shall not subsist on the earth, (<a href="3927/psalms_140_11.htm">Psalms 140:11</a>).<p>Thou shalt hide them in Thy tabernacle from the strife of tongues, (<a href="3927/psalms_31_20.htm">Psalms 31:20</a>).<p>I will bring a nation upon you, whose tongue thou knowest not, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_5_15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>).<p>To be sent to people of heavy tongue, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_3_5.htm">Ezekiel 3:5-6</a>).<p>To people of barbarous tongue, (<a href="3927/isaiah_33_19.htm">Isaiah 33:19</a>).<p>It is to be known that "tongue," as an organ, signifies doctrine, but, as speech, it also signifies religion.</p><p>[4] He who knows that "tongue" signifies doctrine, may understand what is meant by the words of the rich man in hell to Abraham:<p>That he would send Lazarus that he might dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool his tongue, that he should not be tormented in the flame, (<a href="3927/luke_16_24.htm">Luke 16:24</a>).<p>"Water" signifies truth, and "tongue" doctrine; by the falsities of which he was tormented, and not by the flame; for no one in hell is in flames, but flames there are appearances of the love of falsity; and fire is the appearance of the love of evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 282 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>282. "Et omni tribu et lingua, et populo at gente" significat quod a Domino redempti sint, qui in Ecclesia aut in aliqua Religione in veris quoad doctrinam et in bonis quoad vita in sunt. - Per "tribum" significatur Ecclesia quoad religionem; per "linguam" significatur doctrina ejus, de qua mox; per "populum" significantur qui in veris doctrinae sunt, et abstracte vera doctrinae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_282/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_483" target=_top>483</a>); et per "gentem" significantur qui in bonis vitae sunt, et abstracte bona vitae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_282/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_483" target=_top>483</a>); ex his patet, quod per "ex omni tribu et lingua, et populo et gente," talia quae dicta sunt significentur (ut quoque <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_282/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_627" target=_top>627</a>). Hic nunc confirmabitur, quod per "linguam" in spirituali Sensu significetur doctrina quae est Ecclesiae, et quae est cujusvis Religionis; hoc patet ex his: <p>Lingua mea meditatur justitiam Tuam, omni die laudem Tuam," (Psalms, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_282/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_35_28" target=_top>35:28</a>); <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_282/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_71_24" target=_top>71:24</a>);<p>"Tunc saliet sicut cervus claudus, et cantabit Lingua muti, quia erumpent in deserto aquae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_282/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_35_6" target=_top>Esaias 35:6</a>);<p>"Lingua balborum velox erit ad loquendum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_282/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_32_4" target=_top>Esaias 32:4</a>);<p>apparet sicut ibi per "linguam" intelligatur loquela; sed in Sensu spirituali intelligitur id quod loquuntur, quod est verum doctrinae, quod illis erit a Domino. Similiter, <p>"Juravi quod Mihi se incurvaturum sit omne genu, et juratura omnis Lingua," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_282/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_45_23" target=_top>Esaias 45:23</a>);<p>"Veniet tempus ad congregandum omnes gentes et Linguas, ut veniant et videant gloriam Meam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_282/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_66_18" target=_top>Esaias 66:18</a>);<p>"In diebus illis apprehendent decem viri ex omnibus Linguis gentium alam viri Jehudaei, dicendo, Ibimus vobiscum, quia audivimus Deum cum vobis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_282/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_8_23" target=_top>Sacharias 8:23</a>);<p>haec quoque de conversione gentium a Domino, ad verum doctrinae.

Qui scit quod "lingua" significet doctrinam, intelligere potest quid significatur per verba divitis in Inferno ad Abrahamum, <p>"Ut mitteret Lazarum, ut intingeret extremum digiti in aquam, et refrigeraret linguam ejus, ne cruciaretur in flamma," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_282/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_16_24" target=_top>Luca 16:24</a>);<p>"aqua" significat verum, et "lingua" doctrinam, a cujus falsis cruciabatur, et non a flamma; non enim aliquis in Inferno est in flamma, sed flamma ibi est apparentia amoris falsi, et ignis apparentia amoris mali.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;cxl. pro "cxlv."<p>2.&nbsp;15 pro "15, 16" </p>
