<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第952节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>952.启22:15.“城外有那些犬类、行邪术的、淫乱的、杀人的、拜偶像的，并一切喜爱虚谎、行虚谎的人”表那些无视十诫，也不避开十诫中所列举如罪的任何邪恶，因而活在其中的人无一被接进新耶路撒冷。这就是上述经文的一切细节总体上所表示的，因为此处所指的是十诫，这一点从前面的解释（<a href="892.htm">892</a>节）可以看出来，那里有同样的话，只是此处还提到了“犬类”，“犬或狗”表示那些陷入第九诫和第十诫所提到的欲望之人。</p><p>“犬或狗”总体上表示那些陷入各种欲望，并沉溺于其中的人，具体表示那些纯以肉体为乐，尤其以吃喝为乐的人，这是他们唯一的快乐。正因如此，在灵界，狗因那些而沉溺于其食欲和味觉，在灵界被称为“肉欲”（corporeal appetites）的人而显现。这等人因心智粗鄙，对属教会的事漠不关心；故经上说他们站在“城外”，也就是说，他们不会被接进主的新教会。</p><p>在以下圣言经文中，“犬或狗”具有同样的含义：</p><p>他看守的人是瞎眼的；都是哑巴狗；只知盯着看，躺卧，贪睡，这些狗灵魂麻木，不知饱足。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛56.10.htm">56:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛56.11.htm">11</a>）</p><p>他们好像狗一样狂吠，围城绕行。他们到处游荡，寻找食物，若不得饱，就这样过夜。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗59.6.htm">59:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗59.14.htm">14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗59.15.htm">15</a>）</p><p>“犬或狗”表示最卑劣的人（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯30.1.htm">30:1</a>；撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上24.14.htm">24:14</a>；撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下9.8.htm">9:8</a>；列王纪下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下8.13.htm">8:13</a>），还表示不洁之人；所以在摩西五经，经上说：</p><p>娼妓所得的钱，或狗所得的价，你不可带入耶和华的殿还愿；因为这两样都是耶和华你神所憎恶的。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申23.18.htm">23:18</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 952</h4><p>952. <a href="3927/revelation_22_15.htm">22:15</a> But outside are dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and whoever loves and practices a lie. This symbolically means that no one is received into the New Jerusalem who disregards the Ten Commandments and does not refrain from any of the evils listed there as being sins, and therefore lives caught up in them.<p>This is the general symbolic meaning of the items listed, because they have reference to the Ten Commandments, and what they mean here can be seen from the explanation in no. <a href="892.htm">892</a> above, where a similar list is found. Only here dogs are listed as well, which symbolize people caught up in lusts, the kind of people addressed in the ninth and tenth commandments of the Decalogue.</p><p>[2] Dogs in general symbolize people who are caught up in lusts of every kind and indulge in them, particularly people caught up in merely carnal pleasures, especially in the pleasure of gluttony, which constitutes their only delight. Consequently dogs in the spiritual world are the way people appear who have indulged their gullet and tongue, and they are called there carnal appetites personified. Because people of that character are dull-minded, they regard matters connected with church as unimportant. Therefore we are told that they will stand outside, which is to say that they will not be received into the Lord's New Church.</p><p>[3] Dogs have similar symbolic meanings in the following passages in the Word:<p>His watchmen are blind..., they are all mute dogs..., watching, lying down, loving to sleep. They are single-minded dogs; they never have enough. (<a href="3927/isaiah_56_10.htm">Isaiah 56:10-11</a>)<p>They make a racket like dogs, and go all around the city... They wander about looking for food; if they do not get their fill, they are then up all night. (<a href="3927/psalms_59_6.htm">Psalms 59:6</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_59_14.htm">14-15</a>)<p>The vilest of people are meant by dogs in <a href="3927/job_30_1.htm">Job 30:1</a>, <a href="3927/1-samuel_24_14.htm">1 Samuel 24:14</a>, <a href="3927/2-samuel_9_8.htm">2 Samuel 9:8</a>, and <a href="3927/2-kings_8_13.htm">2 Kings 8:13</a>, and also those who are unclean. So we are told in Deuteronomy,<p>You shall not bring the wages of a harlot or the price of a dog into the house of Jehovah... for any votive offering whatever, for both... are an abomination to Jehovah your God. (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_23_18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 952</h4><p>952. [verse 15] 'For outside are dogs, and enchanters, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and everyone loving and doing a lie' signifies that no one is received into the New Jerusalem who makes the precepts of the Decalogue of no account, and does not flee from any evils there named as sins, and therefore lives in them. These things in general are signified by all those expressions, because they are the precepts of the Decalogue that are understood there, as can be seen from the exposition above (<a href="892.htm">892</a>) where there are similar words; except that here 'dogs' are also named, by which are signified those who are in the lusts that are treated of in the ninth and tenth precepts of the Decalogue.</p><p>[2] By 'dogs' in general are signified those who are in lusts of every kind and indulge them, specifically those who are in purely bodily pleasures, especially those who are in the pleasure of feasting, in which they take special delight. For this reason dogs appear in the spiritual world derived from those who have satisfied their appetite and palate, who are there called bodily appetites. Such, because they are mentally dull, make no account of the things that are of the Church. Therefore it is said that they shall stand outside,' that is, will not be received into the Lord's New Church.</p><p>[3] Similar things are signified by 'dogs' in these passages in the Word:<p>His watchmen are blind, they are all dumb dogs, looking on, lying down, loving to sleep, dogs hardened in soul, they know not satiety. <a href="3927/isaiah_56_10.htm">Isaiah 56:10-11</a>.<p>They are making a noise like dogs and going about in the city, they are wandering for something to eat; if they are not satisfied they pass the night like that. <a href="3927/psalms_59_6.htm">Psalms 59:6</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_59_14.htm">14-15</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_59_7.htm">Psalms 59:7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_59_15.htm">15-16</a>].<p>By 'dogs' are understood the most worthless men (<a href="3927/job_30_1.htm">Job 30:1</a>; <a href="3927/1-samuel_24_14.htm">1 Samuel 24:14</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/1-samuel_24_15.htm">15</a>]; <a href="3927/2-samuel_9_8.htm">2 Samuel 9:8</a>; <a href="3927/2-kings_8_13.htm">2 Kings 8:13</a>); and also the unclean. Therefore it is said in Moses:<p>Thou shalt not bring the reward of a harlot and the price of a dog into the house of Jehovah for any vow whatever, because both are abomination unto Jehovah thy God. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_23_18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_23_19.htm">19</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 952</h4><p>952. Verse 15. For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and doeth a lie, signifies that no one is received into the New Jerusalem, who makes no account of the commandments of the Decalogue, and does not shun any evils there enumerated as sins, and therefore lives in them. This is, in general, what is signified by all the particulars in the above passage, because the commandments of the Decalogue are what are there meant, as may be seen above from the explanation, (<a href="892.htm">892</a>), where similar words occur, except that here "dogs" are also named, by which are signified they who are in lusts, which are also treated of in the ninth and tenth commandments of the Decalogue.</p><p>[2] By "dogs" in general are signified they who are in all kinds of lusts, and indulge them, particularly they who are in pleasures merely corporeal, especially in the pleasure of eating and drinking, in which alone they take delight; for which reason dogs, in the spiritual world, appear from those who have indulged their appetite and palate, and are there called corporeal appetites; such, because they are gross in mind, make no account of the things which are of the church; therefore it is said that they shall stand without, that is, shall not be received into the Lord's New Church.</p><p>[3] "Dogs" have a similar signification in the following passages in the Word:<p>His watchmen are blind; they are all dumb dogs; gazing, lying down, loving to slumber, dogs hardened in soul, they know not satiety, (<a href="3927/isaiah_56_10.htm">Isaiah 56:10-11</a>).<p>They make a noise like dogs, and go round about the city. They wander for food, and if they be not satisfied, they thus pass the night, (<a href="3927/psalms_59_6.htm">Psalms 59:6</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_59_14.htm">14-15</a>).<p>By "dogs" are meant the vilest men, (<a href="3927/job_30_1.htm">Job 30:1</a>; <a href="3927/1-samuel_24_14.htm">1 Samuel 24:14</a>; <a href="3927/2-samuel_9_8.htm">2 Samuel 9:8</a>; <a href="3927/2-kings_8_13.htm">2 Kings 8:13</a>), and also the unclean; therefore it is said in Moses:<p>Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot and the price of a dog, into the house of Jehovah for any vow; because both are an abomination unto Jehovah thy God, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_23_18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 952 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>952. (Vers. 15.) "Foris vero canes, et incantatores, et scortatores, et homicidae, et idololatrae, at omnis amans et faciens mendacium," significat quod non aliquis in Novam Hierosolymam recipiatur, qui nihili facit praecepta Decalogi, et non fugit aliqua mala ibi nominata ut peccata, et ideo vivit in illis. - Haec in genere significantur per omnia illa, quia sunt praecepta Decalogi quae ibi intelliguntur, ut videri potest ab Explicatione supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_952/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_892" target=_top>892</a>), ubi similia sunt; praeter quod hic etiam nominentur "canes," per quos significantur qui in concupiscentiis sunt, de quibus etiam in Nono et in Decimo Praecepto Decalogi agitur. Per "canes" in genere significantur qui in concupiscentiis omnis generis sunt, ac illis indulgent; in specie, qui in voluptatibus mere corporeis sunt, imprimis qui in voluptate commessationum, quibus unice delectantur; quare canes in Mundo spirituali apparent ex illis qui litaverunt gulae et linguae, et vocantur ibi appetitus corporei: tales quia pingui mente sunt, nihili faciunt illa quae Ecclesiae sunt; ideo dicitur quod foris stabunt, hoc est, non in Novam Domini Ecclesiam recipiantur. Similia per "canes" significantur in his in Verbo: <p>"Speculatores ejus caeci omnes sunt Canes muti, spectantes, cubantes, amantes dormitare, Canes obfirmati anima, non sciunt satietatem," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_952/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_56_10-11" target=_top>Esaias 56:10-11</a>);<p>"Tumultuantur sicut Canes, et circumeunt in urbe, vagantur ad comedendum, si non satiantur, ita pernoctant," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_952/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_59_7" target=_top>Psalm 59:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_952/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_59_15" target=_top>15</a> (, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_952/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_59_16" target=_top>16</a>) (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_952/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_59_6" target=_top>6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_952/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_59_14-15" target=_top>14-15</a>));<p>per "canes" intelliguntur vilissimi homines, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_952/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_job_30_1" target=_top>Hiob 30:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_952/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_1-samuel_24_15" target=_top>1 Samuelis 24:15</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_952/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_1-samuel_24_14" target=_top>14</a>); <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_952/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-samuel_9_8" target=_top>2 Samuelis 9:8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_952/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-kings_8_13" target=_top>2 Regnum 8:13</a>; et quoque immundi; quare dicitur apud Mosen: <p>"Non inferes mercedem scorti et pretium Canis in Domum Jehovae quoad votivum quodcunque, quia abominatio Jehovae Dei tui ambo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_952/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_23_19" target=_top>Deuteronomius 23:19</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_952/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_23_18" target=_top>18</a>)). </p>
