<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第479节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>479.启10:8. “我先前从天上所听见的那声音又吩咐我说，你去把那踏海踏地之天使手中展开的小书卷取过来”表天上来的命令，他们要将关于主的这个教义提取出来，但约翰要显明，在那些“龙”、“兽”和“假先知”所表示的人被除去之前，它在教会将如何被接受。又与约翰说话的“先前从天上所听见的那声音”就是对他说“七雷所说的事要封上，不可写出来”（第4节）的那个声音，“七雷所说的事要封上，不可写出来”表示关于主的教义不会被接受，直到那些“龙”、“兽”和“假先知”所表示的人被逐出灵人界，因为在此之前该教义被接受，就会有危险（参看<a href="473.htm">473</a>节）。事实的确如此，约翰通过接下来“吃尽小书卷”显明了这一点。“小书卷”表示关于主的教义（参看<a href="469.htm">469</a>，<a href="472.htm">472</a>节）；“踏海踏地的天使”表示主（<a href="465.htm">465</a>，<a href="470.htm">470</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 479</h4><p>479. Then the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again and said, "Go, take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the earth." (<a href="3927/revelation_10_8.htm">10:8</a>) This symbolizes a commandment from heaven for people to assimilate that doctrine, but in order that John might show how it would be received in the church before those meant by the dragon, the beast and the false prophet were removed.<p>The voice which John heard from heaven now speaking to him again means the voice that told him to seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered and not to write them (verse <a href="3927/revelation_10_4.htm">4</a>), which symbolically meant that the aforesaid doctrine regarding the Lord would not be accepted until after those people meant by the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet had been cast out of the world of spirits, because it would be dangerous before then (see no. <a href="473.htm">473</a> above). The reality of this is clearly shown now by John's eating the little book, as described next.<p>That the little book means doctrine regarding the Lord may be seen in nos. <a href="469.htm">469</a>, <a href="472.htm">472</a>. And that the angel standing on the sea and on the land means the Lord may be seen in nos. <a href="465.htm">465</a>, <a href="470.htm">470</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 479</h4><p>479. [verse 8] 'And the voice that I heard out of heaven [was] speaking with me again saying, Receive the little book opened in the hand of the angel standing upon the sea and upon the land' signifies a command out of heaven that they should draw out that doctrine concerning the Lord, but that it should be made manifest by means of John how it would be received in the Church, before those were removed who are understood by the dragon, the beast and the false prophet. By the 'voice' that he 'heard out of heaven' now speaking with him again is understood the voice that said to him that he should seal up the things that the seven thunders uttered and not write them (verse 4), by which is signified that that doctrine concerning the Lord would not be received until after those who are understood by 'the dragon,' 'the beast' and 'the false prophet' have been cast out of the world of spirits, because of the danger if [they were received] before, as may be seen above (<a href="473.htm">473</a>). That this is the case is now made manifest by means of John, by his eating up the little book, about which it follows on. That by 'the little book' is understood the doctrine concerning the Lord may be seen (<a href="469.htm">469</a>, <a href="472.htm">472</a>); and that by the 'angel standing upon the sea and the land' is understood the Lord (<a href="465.htm">465</a>, <a href="470.htm">470</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 479</h4><p>479. Verse 8. And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke unto me again, saying, Take the little book, which is open in the hand of the angel who is standing upon the sea and upon the earth, signifies a command from heaven, that they should admit that doctrine concerning the Lord, but that it should be made manifest by John, how it would be received in the church, before they who are meant by "the dragon," "the beast," and "the false prophet" are removed. By "the voice which he heard from heaven" now again speaking with him, is meant the voice which said to him to seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and not to write them (verse <a href="3927/revelation_10_4.htm">4</a>), by which is signified that the doctrine concerning the Lord would not be received till after they who are meant by "the dragon," "the beast," and "the false prophet," should be cast out of the world of spirits, because there would be danger were it to be received before, as may be seen above, (<a href="473.htm">473</a>). That this is the case, is now made manifest by John, by his "eating up the little book," as presently follows. That by "the little book" is meant the doctrine concerning the Lord, may be seen, (<a href="469.htm">469</a>, <a href="472.htm">472</a>); and that by "the angel standing upon the sea and upon the earth" is meant the Lord, (<a href="465.htm">465</a>, <a href="470.htm">470</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 479 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>479. (Vers. 8.) "Et vox quam audivi e Caelo iterum loquens cum me, dicens, Recipe Libellum apertum in manu Angeli stantis super mari et super terra," significat mandatum e Caelo ut haurirent <sup>1</sup>illam doctrinam de Domino, sed ut manifestaretur per Johannem quomodo illa in Ecclesia reciperetur, antequam illi qui per "Draconem," "Bestiam," et "Pseudoprophetam" intelliguntur, remoti sunt. - Per "vocem quam audivit e Caelo" nunc iterum loquentem cum illo, intelligitur vox quae dixit illi, quod obsignaret quae locuta sunt septem tonitrua, et ne illa scriberet (vers. 4), per quae significatum est, quod doctrina illa de Domino non reciperetur, quam postquam illi, qui per "Draconem," "Bestiam" et "Pseudoprophetam" intelliguntur, e Mundo spirituum ejecti sunt, quia periculum si prius, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_479/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_473" target=_top>473</a>); quod ita sit, manifestatur nunc per Johannem, per quod "devoraret Libellum," de quo sequitur: quod per "Libellum" intelligatur Doctrina de Domino (videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_479/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_469" target=_top>469</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_479/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_472" target=_top>472</a>); et quod per "Angelum stantem super mari et terra "intelligatur Dominus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_479/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_465" target=_top>465</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_479/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_470" target=_top>470</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;haurirent pro "hauriret" </p>
