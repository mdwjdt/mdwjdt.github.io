<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第219节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>219.“我要进到他那里去，我与他，他与我一同坐席”表主与他们，并他们与主结合。“进去与他坐席”表示主与他结合，由于结合是相互的，所以经上也说“他与我”。“进去与他坐席”表示结合，这一点从主所设立的圣餐明显看出来。藉着圣餐，凡听见祂声音，就是相信圣言的人得主同在；而那些照圣言生活的人则与主结合；照圣言生活，就是行悔改的工并信主。之所以提到“坐席”和“主的晚餐”，是因为晚餐是在傍晚进行，而“傍晚”表示教会的末期；因此，主离开这个世界之时，就是教会的末期到来之时，于是主与门徒坐席，设立了晚餐的圣礼。“傍晚”表旧教会的末期，“早晨”表新教会的初期（<a href="151.htm">151</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 219</h4><p>219. "'I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.'" This symbolically means that the Lord conjoins Himself with them and they with Him.<p>To come in and dine with him means, symbolically, to conjoin Himself with him; and because reciprocity is necessary for conjunction to take place, the statement says also, "and he with Me."<p>That to come in and dine means, symbolically, to be conjoined is apparent from the Holy Supper instituted by the Lord, which brings about the Lord's presence in the case of people who hear His voice, that is to say, who believe the Word, but which brings about conjunction in the case of people who live according to the Word. To live according to the Word is to repent and believe in the Lord.<p>Dining and the Lord's supper are mentioned because a supper takes place in the evening, and evening symbolizes the final period of the church. Consequently when the Lord departed from the world, at the time of the last period of the church, He dined with His disciples and instituted the sacrament of the Holy Supper.<p>To be shown that evening symbolizes the final period of the old church, and morning the initial period of a new church, see no. <a href="151.htm">151</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 219</h4><p>219. 'I will enter in to him, and will sup with him and he with Me' signifies that the Lord conjoins Himself with them and them with Himself. 'To enter in and sup with him' signifies to conjoin Himself with him, and since there must be reciprocity for conjunction to take place, it is also said 'and he with Me.' That being conjoined is signified by 'to enter in and sup' is plain from the HOLY SUPPER instituted by the Lord, by means of which there is the Lord's presence with those who hear His voice, that is, who believe in the Word, but conjunction with those who live in accordance with the Word. To live in accordance with the Word is to practise repentance, and to believe in the Lord. 'Sup' is said, and 'the Lord's Supper,' because a supper takes place in the evening, and by 'evening' the last time of the Church is signified. Therefore when the Lord departed out of the world, and it was then the last time of the Church, he supped with the disciples and instituted the Holy Supper. That 'evening' signifies the last time of an old Church, and 'morning' the first of a new Church, may be seen above (<a href="151.htm">151</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 219</h4><p>219. I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me, signifies that the Lord joins Himself with them and them with Himself. "To come in and sup with him," signifies to join Himself to him, and, since there must be a reciprocal that there may be conjunction, it is also said, "and he with Me." That to be conjoined is signified by "coming in and supping," appears from the Holy Supper instituted by the Lord, by means of which the Lord's presence is effected with those who hear His voice, that is, who believe in the Word, but there is conjunction with those who live according to the Word; to live according to the Word is to do the work of repentance, and to believe in the Lord. "To sup," and "the Lord's Supper," are mentioned, because supper takes place in the evening, and by "the evening" is signified the last time of the church; therefore when the Lord departed out of the world, the last time of the church being then arrived, He supped with His disciples, and instituted the Sacrament of the Supper. That "evening" signifies the last time of the old church and "morning" the first of the New Church may be seen above, (<a href="151.htm">151</a>[1-3]). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 219 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>219. "Intrabo ad illum, et caenabo cum illo, et ille Mecum," significat quod Dominus conjungat Se illis et illos Sibi. - "Intrare et caenare cum illo," significat Se illi conjungere; et quia erit reciprocum ut sit conjunctio, dicitur etiam, "et ille Mecum." Quod conjungi per "intrare et caenare," significetur, patet a Sacra Caena a Domino instituta, per quam fit praesentia Domini apud illos qui audiunt vocem Ipsius, hoc est, qui credunt Verbo, sed conjunctio apud illos qui vivunt secundum Verbum; vivere secundum Verbum est paenitentiam agere, et credere in Dominum. Dicitur "caenare," et "Caena" Domini, quia caena fit vesperi, et per "vesperam" significatur ultimum tempus Ecclesiae; quare cum Dominus abivit e mundo, et tunc ultimum tempus Ecclesiae fuit, caenavit cum discipulis, ac instituit Sacramentum Caenae: quod "vespera" significet ultimum tempus Ecclesiae veteris, ac "mane" primum Ecclesiae novae, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_219/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_151" target=_top>151</a>). <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;151 pro "13" </p>
