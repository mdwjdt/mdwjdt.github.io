<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第750节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>750.“直等到神的话都应验了”表直到关于他们的一切预言都实现了。“应验”表示实现，“神的话”表示圣言中的预言；由于经上说“直等到都应验了”，故它表示它们全都实现了。这句话论及新教教徒，以及他们“把国给那兽”，也就是他们将承认圣言，并将教会建立在圣言上，如刚才所述（<a href="749.htm">749</a>节）。但他们虽承认圣言，声称教会以圣言为基础，却将其教会的教义建立在保罗所说的一句话上，即“人称义是因着信，不在乎遵行律法”（罗马书<a href="http://39-27.cn/罗3.28.htm">3:28</a>），而且这句话被完全错解了（<a href="417.htm">417</a>节）。由于此处说“直等到神的话都应验了”，故有必要说明主对门徒所说的最后这些话表示什么，就是这些话：</p><p>你们要去，使万族作我的门徒，凡我所吩咐你们的一切事，都教训他们遵守；看哪，我终日与你们同在，直到世代的末了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.19.htm">28:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.20.htm">20</a>）</p><p>“直到世代的末了”表示直到教会的终结（<a href="658.htm">658</a>节）；那时，他们若不转向主自己，照祂的诫命生活，就会被主遗弃；因被主遗弃，他们变得像没有宗教信仰的异教徒；然后，主只与那些将属于其新教会的人同在。这些事由“直等到神的话应验了”和”“直到世代的末了”来表示。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 750</h4><p>750. "Until the words of God are fulfilled." This symbolically means, until all the things foretold about them have been fulfilled.<p>To be fulfilled means, symbolically, to be brought to completion, and the words of God symbolize the things that have been foretold in the Word. Because we are also told they are to be fulfilled, it symbolically means, until they all are. This is said in reference to Protestants and the fact that they will give their kingdom to the beast, which is to say, that they will acknowledge the Word and found the church upon it, as just said in no. <a href="749.htm">749</a> above.<p>But though Protestants acknowledge the Word indeed, and say that the church is founded on it, they nevertheless found the doctrine of their church on a single saying of Paul, that "a person is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law" (<a href="3927/romans_3_28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>), which they completely misunderstand (no. <a href="417.htm">417</a>).<p>Because the text says here, "until the words of God are fulfilled," we will also say what the Lord's last words to His disciples symbolized, when He said:<p>Go... and make disciples of all nations..., teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. Amen. (<a href="3927/matthew_28_19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>)<p>Even to the end of the age means even to the end of the church (no. <a href="658.htm">658</a>); and if people then do not turn to the Lord Himself, and live in accordance with His commandments, they are forsaken by the Lord, and people forsaken by the Lord become as pagans, having no religion. The Lord then is present only with people who will be those of His New Church.<p>This is the symbolic meaning of the declarations, "until the Words of God are fulfilled," and "even to the end of the age." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 750</h4><p>750. 'Until God's words shall be consummated' signifies until all the things that have been foretold concerning them have been fulfilled. By 'to be consummated' is signified to be fulfilled; and by 'God's words' are signified the things that have been foretold in the Word; and because it is said 'to be consummated' it signifies until all [have been fulfilled]. This is said of the Protestants, and of the fact that they are going 'to give the kingdom to the beast,' that is, that they are going to acknowledge the Word, and the Church is going to be founded upon it, as just above (<a href="749.htm">749</a>). But indeed they acknowledge the Word and say that the Church should be founded upon it; nevertheless they found the doctrine of their Church upon the single saying of Paul, that MAN IS JUSTIFIED BY FAITH ALONE WITHOUT THE WORKS OF THE LAW (<a href="3927/romans_3_28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>), understood altogether falsely (<a href="417.htm">417</a>). Because here it is said 'until God's words shall be consummated' it shall also be stated what is signified by these, the Lord's last words to His disciples:<p>Going, make all nations disciples, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you all the days even until the consummation of the age, Amen. <a href="3927/matthew_28_19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>.<p>'Even until the consummation of the age' is even until the end of the Church (<a href="658.htm">658</a>); and then if they do not approach the Lord Himself and live in accordance with His precepts, they are left by the Lord; and having been left by the Lord they become like pagans who have no religion. And then the Lord is only with those who will be of His New Church (e nova Ipsius Ecclesia). These things are signified by 'until God's words shall be consummated,' and by 'even until the consummation of the age. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 750</h4><p>750. Until the words of God shall be consummated, signifies until all the things which have been foretold concerning them shall be fulfilled. By "being consummated" is signified to be fulfilled; and by "the words of God" are signified the things which are foretold in the Word; and because it is said "to be consummated" it signifies until they all are fulfilled. This is said of the Protestants, and of "their giving the kingdom to the beast;" that is, that they will acknowledge the Word, and found the church upon it, as just above, (<a href="749.htm">749</a>). But they do indeed acknowledge the Word, and say that the church is founded upon it; and still they found the doctrine of their church upon a single saying of Paul, that "man is justified by faith alone without the works of the law" (<a href="3927/romans_3_28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>), altogether falsely understood, (<a href="417.htm">417</a>). Because it is here said, "until the words of God are consummated," it shall also be told what is signified by the Lord's last words to the disciples, which are these:<p>Go ye and make disciples of all nations, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you all the days, even until the consummation of the age. Amen, (<a href="3927/matthew_28_19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p>"Until the consummation of the age" is until the end of the church, (<a href="658.htm">658</a>); and then, if they do not go to the Lord Himself, and live according to His commandments, they are left by the Lord; and being left by the Lord they become like pagans, who have no religion; and then the Lord is with those only, who will be of His New Church. These things are signified by "until the words of God are consummated," and by "even until the consummation of the age." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 750 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>750. "Donec consummentur verba Dei," significat usque dum impleta sunt omnia quae de illis praedicta sunt. - Per "consummari" significatur impleri; et per "verba Dei" significantur quae in Verbo praedicta sunt; et quia dicitur "consummari," significatur dum omnia. Hoc dicitur de Protestantibus, et de eo quod "daturi sint regnum Bestiae," hoc est, quod agnituri sint Verbum, et Ecclesiam super illo fundaturi, ut mox supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_750/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_749" target=_top>749</a>); sed illi quidem agnoscunt Verbum, et dicunt quod super eo fundetur Ecclesia, usque tamen fundant doctrinam Ecclesiae suae super unico Pauli dicto, quod "Homo sola Fide justificetur sine Operibus Legis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_750/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_romans_3_28" target=_top>Romanos 3:28</a>), prorsus false intellecto (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_750/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_417" target=_top>417</a>). Quia hic dicitur "donec consummentur verba Dei," dicetur etiam quid significatur per Domini ultima verba ad discipulos, haec: <p>"Euntes discipulos facite omnes gentes, docentes eos servare omnia quaecunque mandavi vobis; et ecce, Ego vobiscum sum omnibus diebus usque ad Consummationem saeculi, amen," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_750/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_28_19-20" target=_top>Matthaeus 28:19-20</a>);<p>"usque ad consummationem saeculi" est usque ad finem Ecclesiae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_750/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_658" target=_top>658</a>); et tunc si non adeunt Ipsum Dominum, et vivunt secundum praecepta Ipsius, a Domino relinquuntur; et relicti a Domino fiunt sicut pagani, quibus nulla religio est: et tunc Dominus solum est apud illos, qui e nova Ipsius Ecclesia erunt. Haec significantur per "donec consummentur verba Dei," et per "usque ad consummationem saeculi." </p>
