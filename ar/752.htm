<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>752.对此，我补充以下记事：</p><p>我得以与教宗西斯都五世交谈。他正从靠左的西方某个社群出来，对我说，他被任命为一个社群的总督；这个社群由那些在判断和活动上胜过其他人的天主教徒构成；他之所以成为总督，是因为他在死前半年相信，主教的职位是为了统治而发明的；主救主因是神，所以是唯一当受尊崇和敬拜的那一位；还相信圣经是神性，因而远比教皇们的法令神圣。他说，他直到临终都坚守对宗教的这两大原则的信仰。他还说，他们的圣徒什么都不是。当我告诉他，“圣徒崇拜”这一法令在一次教会公会上已经通过，并被教皇诏书所确认时，他大为惊讶。他说，他现在过着积极的生活，一如他在世时那样；每天早晨为自己计划好他想在夜晚之前完成的九至十件事。我问他，短短几年内，他从哪里得来这么一大笔如搁置在圣安杰洛城堡内的财富。他回答说，他亲笔写信给那些富有的修道院院长，要他们尽他们所愿捐出财富，以作圣用；他们都畏惧他，于是就送来大量财富。当我说，这些财富尚在时，他问：“如今作何用途？”</p><p>与他谈话的过程中，我讲述了自他那时候起，洛雷托的财富就急剧增长和扩充；一些修道院，尤其是西班牙的，同样如此。然而，如今这种增长的势头不像以前那样大了。我补充说，他们保留这些财富没有别的有用目的，只是以拥有它们为乐。我讲到这一点时，还说到，他们就像地狱之神，古人将其称为“冥王”。当我提及冥王时，他回应说：“安静！我知道。”他又说，除了那些擅长判断，能接受“唯独主是天地之神”和“圣言是神圣的神性”之人外，谁也不允许进入他所主管的社群；并说，在主的看顾下，他每天完善这个社群。他继续说，他与一些所谓的圣徒交谈过，但他们一听到并相信自己是圣徒，就变得愚蠢。他甚至认为那些想要如基督那样受崇拜（尽管不是直接的），不承认圣言为当照之生活的神圣神性本身的教皇和主教们头脑迟钝。</p><p>他希望我能对那些如今还活着的人说：基督是天地之神，圣言是神圣的神性；还有，圣灵不会通过任何人的口说话，只有想要被拜为神的撒但才会；那些不留心这些事，如头脑迟钝的人，会离开归入自己的同类，一段时间过后，被投入地狱，加入那些幻想自己为神明的人当中，这些人除了野兽的生活外没有其它生活。对此，我补充说：“恐怕这些话太过严厉，不好写。”但他回答说：“你来写，我来签字，因为它们都是千真万确的。”然后，他离开我，回到自己的社群，签署了一个副本，作为教皇诏书传达给皈依天主教的其它社群。</p><p></p><p></p><p>启示录第十八章解读</p><p>启示录18</p><p>1.这些事以后，我看见另有一位有大权柄的天使从天降下。地就因他的荣耀发光。</p><p>2.他大声喊着说，巴比伦大城倾倒了，倾倒了，成了鬼魔的住处，和各样污秽之灵的巢穴，并各样污秽可憎之雀鸟的巢穴。</p><p>3.因为各族都喝了她邪淫烈怒的酒。地上的君王与她行淫，地上的客商，因她奢华太过就发了财。</p><p>4.我又听见从天上有声音说，我的民哪，你们要从那城出来，免得在她的罪上有分，受她所受的灾殃。</p><p>5.因她的罪恶滔天，她的不义神已经想起来了。</p><p>6.她怎样待你，也要怎样待她，按她所行的加倍地报应她。用她调酒的杯，加倍地调给她喝。<p>7.她怎样荣耀自己，怎样奢华，也要怎样给她痛苦悲哀。因她心里说，我坐着作皇后，并不是寡妇，决不会看见悲哀。<p>8.为此，在一天之内，她的灾殃要一齐来到，就是死亡，悲哀，饥荒，她又要被火烧尽了。因为审判她的主神大有能力。</p><p>9.地上的君王，素来与她行淫一同奢华的，看见烧她的烟，就必为她哭泣哀号。</p><p>10.因怕她的痛苦，就远远地站着说，祸哉，祸哉，巴比伦大城，大有势力的城阿，一时之间你的审判就来到了。</p><p>11.地上的客商也都为她哭泣悲哀，因为没有人再买他们的货物了。</p><p>12.这货物就是金，银，宝石，珍珠，细麻布，紫色料，绸子，朱红色料，各样香木，各样象牙的器皿，各样极宝贵的木头和铜，铁，大理石的器皿，</p><p>13.并肉桂，香料，香膏，乳香，酒，油，细面，麦子，牲口，羊，马，车，并人的身体和灵魂。</p><p>14.你灵魂所贪爱的果子离开了你，一切的珍馐肥甘，和华美的物件，也离开你，你决不能再见了。</p><p>15.贩卖这些货物，借着她发了财的客商，因怕她的痛苦，就远远地站着哭泣悲哀，</p><p>16.说，祸哉，祸哉，这大城阿，素常穿着细麻，紫色，朱红色，嵌有金子，宝石，和珍珠的衣服；一时之间，这么大的财富就归于无有了。</p><p>17.凡船主，和坐船的，并众水手，连所有靠海为业的，都远远地站着，</p><p>18.看见烧她的烟，就喊着说，有何城能比这大城呢？</p><p>19.他们又把尘土撒在头上，哭泣悲哀，喊着说，祸哉，祸哉，这大城阿。凡有船在海中的，都因她的奢侈成了富足。它们一时之间就变为荒凉。</p><p>20.天哪，众圣徒众使徒众先知阿，你们都要因她欢喜。因为神已经在她身上伸了你们的冤。</p><p>21.有一位大力的天使举起一块石头，好像大磨石，扔在海里，说，巴比伦大城，也必这样猛力地被扔下去，决不能再见了。</p><p>22.弹竖琴者，作乐者，吹笛者，吹号者的声音，在你中间决不能再听见。各行手艺人在你中间决不能再遇见。推磨的声音在你中间决不能再听见。</p><p>23.灯光在你中间决不能再照耀。新郎和新妇的声音，在你中间决不能再听见。你的客商原来是地上的大人物。各族也被你的邪术迷惑了。</p><p>24.先知和圣徒，并地上一切被杀之人的血，都在这城里发现了。 </p><h4 align="center">灵义</h4><h4 align="center">整章内容</h4><p>本章继续论述天主教。由于对圣言、因而教会真理的玷污和亵渎，它必灭亡（1-8节）。天主教教阶中的最高者及其性质，以及他们的悲哀（9-10节）。教阶中的较低者（11-16节）。顺服他们的平信徒和普通百姓（17-19节）。天使因移除它的喜乐（20节）。它在灵界由于没有对真理的承认、探究、启示、接受，因而没有构成教会的真理与良善的结合而毁灭（21-24节）。</p><h4 align="center">各节内容</h4><p>第1节．“这些事以后”表继续论及天主教（<a href="753.htm">753</a>节）。“我看见另有一位有大权柄的天使从天降下。地就因他的荣耀发光”表主藉神性真理从天堂而出的强大流注，祂的教会因该流注而处于天堂之光（<a href="754.htm">754</a>节）。</p><p>第2节．“他大声喊着说，巴比伦大城倾倒了，倾倒了”表他叫人们知道，因主的神性大能，凡在天主教，同时通过该宗教而具有统治欲的人在灵界都被毁灭，并被投入众多地狱（<a href="755.htm">755</a>节）。“成了鬼魔的住处”表他们的地狱是出于自我之爱之火的统治欲，和出于对这爱的虚假热情而亵渎天上真理之欲望的地狱（<a href="756.htm">756</a>节）。“和各样污秽之灵的巢穴，并各样污秽可憎之雀鸟的巢穴”表身处这些地狱者的意愿、因而行为的邪恶，和思维、因而构思的虚假是属恶魔的，因为他们离开主，转向自己（<a href="757.htm">757</a>节）。</p><p>第3节.“因为各族都喝了她邪淫烈怒的酒。地上的君王与她行淫”表他们颁布恶毒的信条，这些信条都是对圣言良善和真理的玷污和亵渎，被灌输给凡在受他们统治之国中出生并受教育的人（<a href="758.htm">758</a>节）。“地上的客商，因她奢华太过就发了财”表在教阶中具有大大小小级别的人，他们通过统治神圣事物而追求神性威严和超越帝王的荣耀，并不断致力于通过他们名下修道院和个人财产的增多，以及无止境地从世界所聚敛和累积的财富坚固它，从而通过将属天和属灵的统治权据为己有而为自己获得肉体和属世的快乐（<a href="759.htm">759</a>节）。 </p><p>第4节.“我又听见从天上有声音说，我的民哪，你们要从那城出来，免得在她的罪上有分，受她所受的灾殃”表主对所有人的劝诫，无论在天主教的，还是不在天主教的，要谨防通过承认和情感而与它结合，免得自己的灵魂与其可憎之物发生联结，从而灭亡（<a href="760.htm">760</a>节）。</p><p>第5节.“因她的罪恶滔天，她的不义神已经想起来了”表它的邪恶与虚假侵扰众天堂，主将保护这些天堂免遭由此而来的暴行（<a href="761.htm">761</a>节）。</p><p>第6节.“她怎样待你，也要怎样待她，按她所行的加倍地报应她。用她调酒的杯，加倍地调给她喝”表死后正义的报应和惩罚，那时他们用来迷惑并毁灭他人的邪恶与虚假将照其量和质而报应到他们身上（<a href="762.htm">762</a>节）。<p>第7节.“她怎样荣耀自己，怎样奢华，也要怎样给她痛苦悲哀”表死后，照其内心因着统治而欢喜雀悦，以及心智和肉体因着财富而得意忘形的程度，他们会因被推翻和嘲弄，以及贫苦和悲惨而遭受内在悲伤（<a href="763.htm">763</a>节）。“因她心里说，我坐着作皇后，并不是寡妇，决不会看见悲哀”表他们拥有这些事物，因为出于内心对其统治的欢喜雀悦，以及心智对其财富的得意忘形，他们对自己将永远拥有统治权，必能自我保护，永无可能丧失它们充满信任和信心（<a href="764.htm">764</a>节）。<p>第8节.“为此，在一天之内，她的灾殃要一齐来到，就是死亡，悲哀，饥荒”表因此缘故，在最后审判之时，他们所行邪恶的惩罚会报应到他们身上，这惩罚就是死亡，死亡就是地狱的生命，和因着统治被推翻而遭受的内在悲伤；悲哀就是因贫苦和悲惨取代富有导致的内在悲伤；饥荒就是丧失对一切真理的理解（<a href="765.htm">765</a>节）。“她又要被火烧尽了。因为审判她的主神大有能力”表他们会仇恨主及其天堂和教会，因为那时他们发现，唯独主统治并掌管天上和地上的一切事物，而根本不是靠着自己的任何人（<a href="766.htm">766</a>节）。</p><p>第9节.“地上的君王，素来与她行淫一同奢华的，看见烧她的烟，就必为她哭泣哀号”表那些通过将被歪曲和玷污的圣言真理变成教会神圣事物而拥有更大统治权及其快乐的人，当发现这些事物沦为亵渎之物时所遭受的更内在的悲伤（<a href="767.htm">767</a>节）。</p><p>第10节.“因怕她的痛苦，就远远地站着说，祸哉，祸哉，巴比伦大城，大有势力的城阿，一时之间你的审判就来到了”表他们对惩罚的恐惧，以及那时对如此坚固的天主教竟突然之间被彻底推翻，并且他们会灭亡的极度悲伤（<a href="769.htm">769</a>节）。</p><p>第11节.“地上的客商也都为她哭泣悲哀，因为没有人再买他们的货物了”表教阶中通过神圣事物事奉并获利的级别低者，在此表巴比伦毁灭后，他们因无法像以前那样通过它们谋利而悲伤（<a href="771.htm">771</a>节）。</p><p>第12节.“这货物就是金，银，宝石，珍珠”表他们不再拥有这些事物，因为他们没有与这类事物相对应的属灵良善和真理（<a href="772.htm">772</a>节）。“细麻布，紫色料，绸子，朱红色料”表他们不再拥有这些事物，因为他们没有与这类事物相对应的属天良善和真理（<a href="773.htm">773</a>节）。“各样香木，各样象牙的器皿”表他们不再拥有这些事物，因为他们没有与这类事物相对应的属世良善和真理（<a href="774.htm">774</a>节）。“各样极宝贵的木头和铜，铁，大理石的器皿”表他们不再拥有这些事物，因为他们没有与这类事物相对应的在教会事物上的科学良善和真理（<a href="775.htm">775</a>节）。</p><p>第13节.“并肉桂，香料，香膏，乳香”表他们不再拥有出于属灵良善和真理的敬拜，因为他们的敬拜里面丝毫没有与此处所提及的事物相对应之物（<a href="777.htm">777</a>节）。“酒，油，细面，麦子”表他们不再拥有出于属天良善和真理的敬拜，因为他们的敬拜里面丝毫没有与此处所提及的事物相对应之物（<a href="778.htm">778</a>节）。“牲口，羊”表他们不再拥有出于教会的外在或属世良善和真理的敬拜，因为他们的敬拜里面丝毫没有与此处所提及的事物相对应之物（<a href="780.htm">780</a>节）。“马，车，并人的身体和灵魂”表所有这些事物都取决于他们所没有的对圣言的理解，由此而来的教义，以及圣言字义的良善与真理，因为他们已经歪曲并玷污了它们（<a href="781.htm">781</a>节）。</p><p>第14节.“你灵魂所贪爱的果子离开了你，一切的珍馐肥甘，和华美的物件，也离开你，你决不能再见了”表天上的一切祝福和幸福，甚至诸如他们所渴求的外在的那种将完全逃离，不再出现，因为他们没有对良善与真理的任何属天或属灵的情感（<a href="782.htm">782</a>节）。</p><p>第15节.“贩卖这些货物，借着她发了财的客商，因怕她的痛苦，就远远地站着哭泣悲哀”表罚入地狱之前的状态，以及那时那些利用天堂喜乐的各种特许和承诺而获利之人的恐惧和哀恸（<a href="783.htm">783</a>节）。</p><p>第16节.“说，祸哉，祸哉，这大城阿，素常穿着细麻，紫色，朱红色，嵌有金子，宝石，和珍珠的衣服；一时之间，这么大的财富就归于无有了”表因他们的荣华富贵和利益突然之间被完全摧毁而感到极其悲痛（<a href="785.htm">785</a>节）。</p><p>第17，18节.“凡船主，和坐船的，并众水手，连所有靠海为业的”表那些所谓的平信徒，无论尊严大小，甚至依附于天主教，热爱并亲吻它，或发自内心承认并崇敬它的普通百姓（<a href="786.htm">786</a>节）。“都远远地站着，看见烧她的烟，就喊着说，有何城能比这大城呢”表他们在一种遥远状态下对天主教所受的判罚而悲伤，他们曾以为天主教胜过世上的一切宗教（<a href="787.htm">787</a>节）。</p><p>第19节.“他们又把尘土撒在头上，哭泣悲哀，喊着说，祸哉，祸哉，这大城阿”表他们内在和外在的悲伤和哀恸，也就是对如此显赫的一个宗教竟被完全摧毁并判罚感到悲痛（<a href="788.htm">788</a>节）。“凡有船在海中的，都因她的奢侈成了富足。它们一时之间就变为荒凉”表因此缘故，凡愿意购买的人都通过天主教的神圣事物而获赦免，因为世俗和短暂的财富换来属灵和永恒的财富；而现在却没有人买它们了（<a href="789.htm">789</a>节）。</p><p>第20节.“天哪，众圣徒众使徒众先知阿，你们都要因她欢喜。因为神已经在她身上伸了你们的冤”表天上的天使和处于来自圣言的良善与真理的教会之人都要因那些陷入天主教的邪恶与虚假之人被移除和弃绝而发自内心的欢喜（<a href="790.htm">790</a>节）。</p><p>第21节.“有一位大力的天使举起一块石头，好像大磨石，扔在海里，说，巴比伦大城，也必这样猛力地被扔下去，决不能再见了”表凭主出于天堂的强大流注，天主教及其一切被玷污的圣言真理都将一头栽入地狱，永不再出现在天使面前（<a href="791.htm">791</a>节）。</p><p>第22节.“弹竖琴者，作乐者，吹笛者，吹号者的声音，在你中间决不能再听见”表他们当中不再有对属灵真理和良善的任何情感，也不再有对属天良善和真理的任何情感（<a href="792.htm">792</a>节）。“各行手艺人在你中间决不能再遇见”表那些因教义和照之的生活陷入天主教的人，就他们自己而言，没有对属灵真理的任何理解，因而没有任何属灵真理的思维（<a href="793.htm">793</a>节）。“推磨的声音在你中间决不能再听见”表那些因教义和照之的生活陷入天主教的人没有寻求、探究、确认属灵真理，因为所接受、确认、因而植入的虚假阻挡了（<a href="794.htm">794</a>节）。 </p><p>第23节.“灯光在你中间决不能再照耀”表那些因教义和照之的生活陷入天主教的人没有来自主的任何启示，因而没有对属灵真理的洞察（<a href="796.htm">796</a>节）。“新郎和新妇的声音，在你中间决不能再听见”表那些因教义和照之的生活陷入天主教的人没有构成教会的良善与真理的结合（<a href="797.htm">797</a>节）。“你的客商原来是地上的大人物”表他们的教阶中级别高者是这样：他们利用在修会教规上留给他们的各种特权作交易并谋利（<a href="799.htm">799</a>节）。“各族也被你的邪术迷惑了”表他们的邪恶伎俩和诡计，他们以此将所有人的心智从对主的神圣敬拜引向对活人、死人和偶像的亵渎敬拜（<a href="800.htm">800</a>节）。</p><p>第24节.“先知和圣徒，并地上一切被杀之人的血，都在这城里发现了”表对圣言、因而教会的一切真理的玷污和亵渎皆来自“大城巴比伦”所指的天主教，由此散发的虚假已经进入整个基督教界。</p><h4 align="center">诠释</h4>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 752</h4><p>752. To this I will append the following account:<p>I was given to speak with Pope Sixtus V. <sup>1</sup>He came from a society in the west to my left. He told me that he had been put as chief governor over a society composed of Catholics who more than others excelled in judgment and industry. He said he had been made their chief governor because he had believed during the last half year before his death that the vicariate was an invention in order to gain dominion, and that the Lord the Savior, being God, was the only one who should be venerated and worshiped. He also said that the Holy Scripture is Divine and thus more holy than the edicts of popes. Pope Sixtus said that he had continued to believe in these two principal tenets of religion to the end of his life.<p>Pope Sixtus also said that their saints are of no account. He was surprised when I told him that it had been decided in council and confirmed by a bull that saints should be invoked.<p>He said that he led an active life as he had in the world, and that every morning he proposes to himself nine or ten things that he wishes to be accomplished by the end of the evening.<p>I asked him where he had obtained in so few years the great treasury he had placed in the Castelo del Angelo. He replied that he had written with his own hand to the prefects of wealthy monasteries, telling them to send him as much of their wealth as in their judgment they could, as it was for a holy purpose, and because they feared him, they sent it in abundance.<p>Moreover, when I said that the treasury still exists, he said, "Of what use is it now?"</p><p>[2] While speaking with him, I reported that since his time the treasury at Loreto had been immensely increased and enriched, and so, too, the treasuries in some monasteries, primarily in Spain, but not so much today as in earlier centuries. I added also that these treasuries are preserved for no other useful purpose than the pleasure of possessing them. Moreover, when I reported this, I said, too, that those who possessed them were thus like the gods of the underworld that the ancients called Plutos. <sup>2</sup><p>When I mentioned Plutos, Pope Sixtus responded, "Hush! I know."<p>Pope Sixtus said again that the only people admitted into the society over which he presides are those who excel in judgment, and who can accept that the Lord alone is God of heaven and earth, and that the Word is holy and Divine. Moreover, under the Lord's auspices he is perfecting that society daily, he said.<p>He also said that he has spoken with some so-called saints, but that they become foolish when they are told and believe that they are holy.<p>He even called stupid those popes and cardinals who wish to be venerated like Christ, even if they are not venerated in person, and who do not acknowledge the Word to be actually holy and Divine, which alone is what people ought to live by.</p><p>[3] Pope Sixtus wishes me to tell people who are alive today that Christ is God of heaven and earth, that the Word is holy and Divine, and that it is not the Holy Spirit that speaks through someone's mouth, but Satan, who wishes to be venerated as God.<p>Moreover, he said that people who do not pay attention to his words go away, as stupid, to their own kind, and after a time are cast down into hell to people who labor under the fantasy that they are gods, where the only life they have is the that of a wild animal.<p>At this I said, "Your words are perhaps too harsh for me to write."<p>But he replied, "Write them and I will sign them, because they are true."<p>And he went away from me then into his society and signed a copy, and sent it as a bull to other societies committed to the same religion.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Born Felice Peretti, 1521-1590, Italian ecclesiastic, Pope 1585-1590.<br><br>2.&nbsp;The Roman deity Pluto, god of the underworld, was in later times often confused with the minor Greek deity Plutus (Plou'to"), god of abundance and wealth, a confusion reflected also here and elsewhere in the writer's works. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 752</h4><p>752. To these things I will add this MEMORABLE OCCURRENCE. It was given [me] to speak with the Pontiff SEXTUS THE FIFTH. He was going out of a certain society in the west towards the left. He said to me that he was appointed as chief governor of a society gathered together from Catholics who excel the rest in judgment and activity; and that he became their chief governor on account of his having, for half a year before his death, believed that the vicarship was an invention for the sake of dominion; and that the Lord the Saviour, because He is God, is He Who Only ought to be adored and worshipped; also that the Sacred Scripture is Divine, and is thus holy above the edicts of Popes. He said that until the end of his life he remained firm in the faith of these two principles of religion. He said also that their saints are not anything. He was astonished when I related that it had been decreed in a synod, and confirmed by a bull, that they should be invoked. He said that he is in such a life of activity as he had been in the world; and that every morning he proposes nine or ten things to himself which he wants to have accomplished before the evening. I asked whence he obtained within so few years such a great treasure as he laid up in the Castelo del Angelo. He replied that he wrote with his own hand to the rulers of rich monasteries to send of their wealth as much as they would from choice because it was for a holy use; and that because they were afraid of him they sent abundantly. And when I said that that treasure is still in existence, he said, 'What use is it now?'</p><p>[2] In the course of speaking with him I related that since his time the treasure at Loretto has been immensely augmented and enriched, and so likewise have the treasures in certain monasteries, especially in Spain. However, at the present day this increase has not been so much as in former ages. And I added, that they are keeping them without any useful purpose other than that they should be pleased on account of possessing them. And when I related this, I also said that they are such as the infernal gods, which the ancients used to call Plutos. When I mentioned Plutos, he replied, 'Hush! I know.' He said again that no others are admitted into the society that he is set over but those who excel in judgment, and are able to receive [the truth] that the Lord Only is the God of heaven and earth, and that the Word is the Divine Holy (Sanctum Divinum); and that under the Lord's auspices he is perfecting that society every day. He also said that he has spoken with so-called saints, but that they become foolish when they hear and believe that they are saints. He was even calling stupid those Pontiffs and cardinals who wish to be adored as Christ, although not in person, and who do not acknowledge the Word as the Divine Holy itself in accordance only with which one ought to live.</p><p>[3] He wishes me to say to those who are living today that Christ is the God of heaven and earth, and that the Word is the Divine Holy; also that the Holy Spirit does not speak through anyone's mouth, but Satan does who wishes to be adored as God; and that those who do not give heed to these things, as the stupid, go away to their own kind and after a time are cast down into hell to those who labour under the phantasy that they are gods and these have no other life than the life of a wild beast. To this I said, 'Perhaps these things are too harsh for me to write.' But he replied, 'Write, and I will sign them, for they are true.' And then he went away from me into his own society, and he signed one copy and transmitted it as a BULL to other societies attached to the same religion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 752</h4><p>752. To this I will add this Relation. It was granted me to speak with Pope Sextus Quintus. He came out of a certain society in the west to the left. He said to me that he was appointed as chief governor of a society collected from Catholics who excel the rest in judgment and industry; and that he was made their chief governor for the reason that he had believed for half a year before his death that the vicarship was an invention for the sake of dominion; and that the Lord the Savior, because He is God, is He who is alone to be adored and worshiped; also that the Sacred Scripture is Divine, and thus more holy than the edicts of popes. He said that he remained firm in the belief of these two heads of religion until the end of his life. He also said that their saints are not anything. He wondered when I related that it was decreed in a synod, and confirmed by a bull, that they should be invoked. He said that he led an active life as he had done in the world; and that he proposed to himself every morning nine or ten things, which he wished should be accomplished before evening.<p>I asked whence he obtained in so few years so great a treasure as he had laid up in the castle of Angelo. He replied that he wrote with his own hand to the rulers of the rich monasteries, to send him at their discretion from their resources as much as they were willing, as it was for a holy use; and that they sent abundantly, because they feared him. And when I said that that treasure was still remaining, he said, "For what use is it now?"</p><p>[2] While speaking with him, I related that since his time the treasure in Loretto had been immensely increased and enriched, and in like manner the treasures in certain monasteries, especially in Spain; but not to so great a degree at this day as in former ages. And I added, that they keep them without any end of use, other than to enjoy themselves from their possession. And when I related this, I said also that they are thus like the infernal gods, which the ancients called Plutos. When I mentioned Plutos, he replied, "Be silent, I know." He said again, that no others are admitted into the society over which he presided, but those who excel in judgment, and can receive the belief that the Lord alone is the God of heaven and earth, and that the Word is the Holy Divine; and that under the Lord's auspices he is every day perfecting that society. And he said that he has spoken with the saints so called; but that they become foolish, when they hear and believe that they are saints. He also called the pontiffs and cardinals stupid, those who wish to be adored like Christ, though not in person, and who do not acknowledge the Word as the Holy Divine itself, according to which alone one should live.</p><p>[3] He wishes me to say to those who are now living, that Christ is the God of heaven and earth, and that the Word is the Holy Divine; and that the Holy Spirit does not speak through the mouth of anyone, but Satan, who wishes to be adored as God; and that they who do not attend to these things, as stupid, go away to their own, and after a time are cast down into hell, to those who labor in the fantasy that they are gods; who have no other life than the life of a wild beast. To this I said, "Perhaps these things are too hard for me to write." But he answered, "Write, and I will endorse it, because they are true." And then he went away from me into his society, and endorsed one copy, and transmitted it as a Bull to the other societies devoted to the same religion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 752 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>752. His adjiciam hoc MEMORABILE:-<p>Datum est loqui cum Pontifice Sixto Quinto. Exibat e societate quadam in occidente ad sinistrum. Dixit mihi quod praefectus sit ut summus Moderator societati collectae ex Catholicis, qui pollent judicio et industria prae reliquis; et quod factus sit summus Moderator illorum, propter causam, quia a dimidio anni ante obitum suum crediderat quod Vicariatus esset inventum propter dominium; et quod Dominus Salvator, quia Deus, sit Qui Solus adorandus et colendus est, tum quod Scriptura Sacra sit Divina, et sic sancta prae Edictis Paparum. Dixit quod in fide duorum istorum capitum Religionis permanserit usque ad finem vitae suae. <p>Dixit etiam quod Sancti illorum non sint aliquid: miratus est, cum narravi, quod in Synodo decretum sit, et per Bullam confirmatum, quod invocarentur. <p>Dixit quod in vita activitatis sit, in quali fuerat in mundo; et quod sibi quovis mane proponat novem aut decem res, quas vult ut intra vesperam sint peractae. <p>Quaesivi unde illi intra tam paucos annos tantus thesaurus, quem in Castello del Angelo reposuit. Respondit quod propria manu scripserit ad Praefectos monasteriorum divitum, ut pro arbitrio mitterent ex opibus quantum vellent, quia ad usum sanctum; et quod quia timebant illum, miserint abundanter. Et cum dixi quod thesaurus ille ad huc superstes sit, dixit, "Cui usui nunc." <p>Inter loquendum cum illo retuli, quod thesaurus in Loretto ab illius tempore immensum auctus et locupletatus sit; et quod thesauri in quibusdam monasteriis, imprimis in Hispania, similiter; sed hodie non in tantum ut in prioribus saeculis. Et addidi quod illos custodiant, absque ullo fine qui est usus, alio quam ut jucundent se ex possessione. <p>Et cum hoc retuli, etiam dixi quod ita sint sicut dii infernales, quos antiqui vocabant Plutones. <p>Cum nominavi Plutones, respondit, "Tace, scio." <p>Dixit iterum quod in societatem cui ille praeest, non alii admittantur quam qui judicio pollent, et recipere possunt quod Dominus Solus sit Deus Caeli et Terrae, et quod Verbum sit Sanctum Divinum; et quod perficiat quotidie, sub auspicio Domini, <p>societatem illam. <p>Et dixit quod locutus sit cum Sanctis ita dictis, sed quod fiant fatui quando audiunt et credunt quod sancti sint. Etiam Pontifices et Cardinales vocabat stupidos, illos qui volunt adorari sicut Christus, tametsi non in persona, et qui non agnoscunt Verbum ut ipsum Sanctum Divinum, secundum quod solum vivendum est. <p>Vult ut dicam illis qui hodie vivunt, quod Christus sit Deus Caeli et Terrae, et quod Verbum sit Sanctum Divinum; et quod Spiritus Sanctus non loquatur per os alicujus, sed Satanas, qui vult adorari sicut Deus: et quod illi qui ad haec non attendunt, ut stupidi, abeant ad suos, et post tempus dejiciantur in Infernum ad illos qui laborant phantasia quod dii sint; quibus non alia vita est quam vita ferae. <p>Ad haec dixi, "Forte haec nimis dura sunt ut scribam." <p>Sed respondit, "Scribe, et subscribo, quia vera sunt." <p>Et tunc a me abivit in societatem suam, et unum exemplar subscripsit, ac ut Bullam ad alias societates eidem Religioni addictas transmisit. </p>
