<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第12节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>12.“但愿恩惠、平安归与你们”表神性问候。下文会解释当如何理解“恩惠”和“平安”的具体含义。从路加福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.36.htm">24:36</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.37.htm">37</a>）和约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.19.htm">20:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.21.htm">21</a>）可以看出，“愿你们平安”是主对门徒的问候，因而是一种神性问候。照主的吩咐，这也是门徒向凡愿意接待他们的人所致的问候（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.11.htm">10:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.15.htm">15</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 12</h4><p>12. Grace to you and peace. This symbolizes a Divine salutation.<p>What grace and peace mean specifically will be told in explanations to follow. "Peace to you" was the Lord's greeting to His disciples, thus a Divine salutation, as may be seen in <a href="3927/luke_24_36.htm">Luke 24:36-37</a> <sup>1</sup>and <a href="3927/john_20_19.htm">John 20:19-21</a>, <sup>2</sup>and by the Lord's command it was the greeting of the disciples to all those into whose houses they might enter (<a href="3927/matthew_10_11.htm">Matthew 10:11-15</a>). <sup>3</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"Now as they said these things, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, 'Peace to you.' But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed they had seen a spirit.<br><br>2.&nbsp;"Then, the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, 'Peace to you.' When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.<br><br>3.&nbsp;"Now whatever city or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there till you go out. And when you go into a household, greet it. If the household is worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. And whoever will not receive you nor hear your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet. Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city! </p>
