<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第850节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>850.启20:5.“其余的死人还没有复活，直等那一千年完了”表除了现在所提到的这些人外，其余的人无一被接升天堂，直到那“龙”被释放后，那时他们便接受测试和审查，以查明他们的性质。“其余的死人”表示也被那些陷入唯信的人所弃绝的人，因为他们敬拜主，并照祂的诫命生活，只是还没有接受测试和审查，以查明他们的性质。此处“死人”表示这些人（<a href="847.htm">847</a>节）。因为所有人离世后首先进入天堂与地狱中间的灵人界，在那里接受测试和审查，并做好预备，恶者预备下地狱，善者预备上天堂。经上论到这些人说，他们“还没有复活”，也就是说，他们尚未像前者那样与主结合，并与天上的天使相联。后来，又有许多人得救，这一点从本章12-15节经文明显可知，在那里经上说“案卷展开了，若发现有人没记在生命册上，他就被扔在火湖里”。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 850</h4><p>850. <a href="3927/revelation_20_5.htm">20:5</a> But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were completed. This symbolically means that besides these just described, no others were raised into heaven until after the dragon was set loose and they were then tried and examined to discover their character.<p>The rest of the dead symbolize people who were rejected by those caught up in faith alone because they worshiped the Lord and lived in accordance with His commandments, but who had not yet been tried and examined to discover their character. That these are the people symbolized by the dead here may be seen in no. <a href="847.htm">847</a> above. For after their departure from the world, all people first come into the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, and there they are tried and examined and in this way prepared, the evil for hell and the good for heaven. It is said of these that they did not live again, that is, that they were not yet so conjoined with the Lord and affiliated with angels in heaven as the first people were.<p>That many of these were afterward saved is apparent from verses <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">12</a> to 15 in this chapter, where we are told that the Book of Life was also opened, and anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 850</h4><p>850. [verse 5] 'And the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished' signifies that besides those mentioned no others were taken up into heaven till after 'the dragon' was let loose, and those were then tested and examined [to discover] what they were like. By 'the rest of the dead' are signified those who were also rejected by those who are in faith alone, because they worshipped the Lord and lived in accordance with His precepts, but who were not yet tested and examined [to discover] what they were like. That here those are signified by 'the dead' may be seen above (<a href="847.htm">847</a>). For all after their departure from the world first come into the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, and there they are tested and examined, and there prepared, the evil for hell and the good for heaven. It is said of these that they 'did not live again' yet, that is, they were not yet so conjoined with the Lord and in association with the angels of heaven as the former. That afterwards many also were saved is plain from verse 12, 15 of this chapter, where it is said that also 'the book of life was opened, and if anyone was not found written in the book of life he was cast into the lake of fire. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 850</h4><p>850. Verse 5. And the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished, signifies that besides these now spoken of, none were taken up into heaven, till after the dragon was loosed, when their quality was proved and explored. By "the rest of the dead" are signified they who are also rejected by those who are in faith alone, because they worshiped the Lord, and lived according to His commandments, but whose quality was not yet proved and explored. That here by "the dead" these are signified, may be seen above, (<a href="847.htm">847</a>). For all after their departure out of the world, come first into the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, and are there proved and explored, and thus prepared, the evil for hell, and the good for heaven. It is said of these that they lived not again, that is, they were not yet so conjoined with the Lord, and consociated with the angels of heaven, as the former. That afterwards also many were saved, appears from verses 12, 15 of this chapter, where it is said that "the book of life also was opened, and if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 850 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>850. (Vers. 5.) "Et reliqui mortuorum non revixerunt, donec consummarentur mille anni," significat quod praeter illos, de quibus dictum est, non aliqui sublati sint in Caelum quam postquam Draco solutus est, et illi tunc probati et explorati quales essent. -Per "reliquos mortuorum" significantur qui etiam rejecti ab illis qui in sola Fide sunt, quia coluerunt Dominum, et vixerunt secundum praecepta Ipsius, sed nondum probati et explorati sunt quales erant; quod per "mortuos" hic illi significentur, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_850/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_847" target=_top>847</a>). Omnes enim post excessum e mundo, primum veniunt in Mundum spirituum, qui est medius inter Caelum et Infernum, et ibi probantur et explorantur, et sic praeparantur, mali ad Infernum et boni ad Caelum; de his dicitur quod nondum revixerint, hoc est, nondum ita conjuncti Domino, et consociati angelis Caeli essent, sicut priores. Quod postea etiam multi salvati sint patet a vers. 12 et 15, hujus capitis, ubi dicitur quod etiam apertus sit Liber vitae, et si quis non inventus est in libro vitae scriptus, conjectus sit in stagnum ignis. </p>
