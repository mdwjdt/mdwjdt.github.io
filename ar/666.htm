<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第666节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>666.“因为独有你是圣的”表祂是圣言，真理和启示。关于唯独主是神圣的（参看<a href="173.htm">173</a>节）；被称为“圣”的，正是神性真理（<a href="173.htm">173</a>，<a href="580.htm">580</a>节）；由于圣言是神性真理，而主就是神性真理，还由于神性真理进行属灵地启示，它就是天上的光，不过是从主来的，故“因为独有你是圣的”就表示主是圣言，真理和启示。由于圣言是神性真理，神性真理进行属灵地启示，所以才说圣言是由耶和华通过圣灵口述的，并且圣灵启示、教导人；但是，谁不知道神是全在，神圣事物从祂发出，不知道祂在哪里被接受，祂就在哪里启示人？谁不能由此得出结论：圣灵并非凭自己而成为一位神，有别于耶和华或主，如同一个位格有别于另一个位格？事实上，圣灵就是耶和华或主自己。凡承认神性全在的，也会承认这一点。在圣言中，“圣灵”是指主的神性生命，因而是指祂自己；具体是指祂的智慧生命，也就是所谓的“神性真理”；这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》（<a href="../lord/50.htm">50</a>-53节）一书，那里通过圣言说明了这一点。主就是圣言（参看约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）；祂是真理（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>）；祂是光，因而是启示（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.34.htm">12:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.36.htm">36</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 666</h4><p>666. "For You alone are holy." This symbolically means that the Lord embodies the Word, truth, and enlightenment.<p>That the Lord alone is holy may be seen in no. <a href="173.htm">173</a> above, and that He is the Divine truth called holy, in nos. <a href="173.htm">173</a>, <a href="586.htm">586</a>. Moreover, because the Word is Divine truth, and the Lord embodies Divine truth, and because Divine truth enlightens spiritually, being the light in heaven, but emanating from the Lord, therefore the declaration, "For You alone are holy," symbolically means that the Lord embodies the Word, truth, and enlightenment.<p>Since the Word is Divine truth, and Divine truth enlightens spiritually, therefore people say that Jehovah dictated the Word through the agency of the Holy Spirit, and that the Holy Spirit enlightens a person and instructs him. But who does not know that God is omnipresent, and that holiness emanates from Him and enlightens wherever it is received? Who, then, cannot but conclude that the Holy Spirit is not God per se, distinguishable from Jehovah or the Lord as one person is from another, but that it is Jehovah Himself or the Lord? Anyone who acknowledges the Divine omnipresence must also acknowledge this.<p>That the Holy Spirit in the Word means the Lord's Divine life, thus Himself, and in particular the life of His Divine wisdom called Divine truth, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord, nos. <a href="../lord/50.htm">50-53</a> where we demonstrated this from the Word.<p>That the Lord embodies the Word may be seen in <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>. That He embodies the truth, <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>. That He embodies the light and thus enlightenment, <a href="3927/john_12_34.htm">John 12:34-36</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 666</h4><p>666. 'For Thou Only art Holy' signifies that He is the Word, the Truth (veritas), and Enlightenment. That the Lord Only is Holy may be seen above (<a href="173.htm">173</a>); and that it is Divine Truth that is called 'Holy' (<a href="573.htm">573</a>, <a href="580.htm">580</a>). And because the Word is Divine Truth, and the Lord is that, and because Divine Truth spiritually enlightens, for it is the light in heaven, but from the Lord, therefore by 'because He Only is Holy' is signified that the Lord is the Word, the Truth (veritas), and Enlightenment. Since the Word is Divine Truth, and Divine Truth spiritually enlightens, it is therefore said that the Word has been dictated by Jehovah by means of the Holy Spirit, and that the Holy Spirit enlightens and teaches man; but who does not know that God is Omnipresent, and that the Holy proceeds from Him, and that He enlightens where He is received? Who cannot conclude from this that the Holy Spirit is not a God by itself distinct from Jehovah or the Lord as person from person, but that He is Jehovah Himself or the Lord? He who acknowledges the Divine Omnipresence will also acknowledge this. That by 'the Holy Spirit' in the Word is understood the Lord's Divine Life, thus Himself, and specifically the life of His Wisdom that is called the Divine Truth (veritas), may be seen in <a href="../lord/50.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD 50-53</a>, where this has been proved out of the Word. That the Lord is the Word may be seen (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>). That He is the Truth (veritas) (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>). That He is the Light and the resulting enlightenment (<a href="3927/john_12_34.htm">John 12:34-36</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 666</h4><p>666. For thou alone art holy, signifies that He is the Word, the truth, and enlightenment. That the Lord alone is holy, see above, (<a href="173.htm">173</a>); and that it is the Divine truth which is called holy, (<a href="173.htm">173</a>, <a href="580.htm">580</a>); and as the Word is the Divine truth, and the Lord is that, and as the Divine truth spiritually enlightens, for it is light in heaven, but from the Lord, therefore by, "because He alone is holy," is signified that the Lord is the Word, the truth, and enlightenment. Since the Word is the Divine truth, and the Divine truth spiritually enlightens, therefore it is said that the Word was dictated by Jehovah through the Holy Spirit, and that the Holy Spirit enlightens and teaches man; but who does not know that God is omnipresent, and that what is holy proceeds from Him, and that where He is received He enlightens? Who may not thence conclude, that the Holy Spirit is not a God by itself, distinct from Jehovah, or the Lord, as one Person from another, but that it is Jehovah, or the Lord Himself? He who acknowledges the Divine omnipresence, will also acknowledge this. That by "the Holy Spirit," in the Word, is meant the Divine life of the Lord, thus Himself, and in particular the life of His wisdom, which is called the Divine truth, may be seen in the <a href="../lord/50.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord 50-53</a>, where it is shown from the Word. That the Lord is the Word, may be seen, (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>). That He is the truth, (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>): that He is the Light, and consequently enlightenment, (<a href="3927/john_12_34.htm">John 12:34-36</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 666 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>666. "Quia Solus Sanctus" significat quod sit Verbum, Veritas et Illustratio. -Quod Dominus sit Solus Sanctus, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_666/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173" target=_top>173</a>); et quod Divinum Verum sit quod vocatur Sanctum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_666/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_173" target=_top>173</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_666/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_580" target=_top>580</a>); et quia Verbum est Divinum Verum, et Dominus est illud, et quia Divinum Verum spiritualiter illustrat, est enim lux in Caelo, sed a Domino, ideo per "quia Solus est Sanctus" significatur quod Dominus sit Verbum, Veritas et Illustratio. Quoniam Verbum est Divinum Verum, ac Divinum Verum spiritualiter illustrat, ideo dicitur quod Verbum a Jehovah dictatum sit per Spiritum Sanctum, ac quod Spiritus Sanctus hominem illustret et doceat; sed quis non scit quod Deus Omnipraesens sit, et quod Sanctum procedat ab Ipso, et quod illustret ubi recipitur. Quis inde non potest concludere quod Spiritus Sanctus non sit Deus per Se, distinctus a Jehovah seu Domino ut persona a persona, sed quod sit ipse Jehovah seu Dominus; qui Divinam Omnipraesentiam agnoscit, etiam id agnoscet. Quod per "Spiritum Sanctum" in Verbo intelligatur Divina Vita Domini, ita Ipse, et in specie Vita Sapientiae Ipsius, quae vocatur Divina Veritas, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_666/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_50" target=_top>Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 50-53</a>, ubi id ex Verbo demonstratum est. Quod Dominus sit Verbum, videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_666/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_1" target=_top>Johannes 1:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_666/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_14" target=_top>14</a>; quod sit Veritas, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_666/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_6" target=_top>Johannes 14:6</a>; quod sit Lux, et inde Illustratio, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_666/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_34-36" target=_top>Johannes 12:34-36</a>. </p>
