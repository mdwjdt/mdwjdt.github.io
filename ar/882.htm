<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第882节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>882.启21:3.“我听见有大声音从天上出来说，看哪！神的帐幕在人间”表主出于爱讲说并宣告好消息，以便祂自己将以其神性人与世人同在。这就是这些话的属天之义。属天的天使，也就是第三层天的天使，并不将这些话作别的理解；事实上，他们在天上将“听见有大声音从天上出来说”理解为主出于爱讲说并宣告好消息，因为除了主，没有人出于天堂说话；事实上，天堂之所以为天堂，不是凭着天使的固有属性，而是凭着主的神性，众天使只是这神性的接受者而已。“大声音”表示出于爱的言语，因为“大”论及爱（<a href="656.htm">656</a>，<a href="663.htm">663</a>节）。“看哪，神的帐幕在人间”表示如今主以其神性人临在。“神的帐幕”表示属天教会，在普遍意义表示主的属天国度，在至高意义上表示主的神性人（参看<a href="585.htm">585</a>节）。“帐幕”在至高意义上之所以表示主的神性人，是因为在圣言中，“殿”表示神性人，这一点从相关经文明显可知（如约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.19.htm">2:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.21.htm">21</a>；玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.1.htm">3:1</a>；启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.22.htm">21:22</a>等）。“帐幕”同样表示神性人，区别在于：“殿”表示主神性人的神性真理或神性智慧，而“帐幕”表示主神性人的神性良善或神性之爱。由此可知，“看哪，神的帐幕在人间”表示如今主以其神性人与世人同在。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 882</h4><p>882. <a href="3927/revelation_21_3.htm">21:3</a> And I heard a great voice from heaven saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men." This symbolizes the Lord speaking out of love and proclaiming that He will now be present with people in His Divine humanity.<p>This is the celestial meaning of these words. Celestial angels, or angels of the third heaven, interpret them in just this way, for to hear a great voice from heaven speaking means to them the Lord speaking and proclaiming something out of love, for it is only the Lord who speaks out of heaven. That is because heaven is not heaven owing to the angels' own qualities, but to the Lord's Divinity, of which they are recipients. A great voice means speech springing from love, for greatness is predicated of love (nos. <a href="656.htm">656</a>, <a href="663.htm">663</a>). "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men" means that now the Lord will be present in His Divine humanity. The tabernacle of God means the celestial church, in a universal sense the Lord's celestial kingdom, and in the highest sense the Lord's Divine humanity, as may be seen in no. <a href="585.htm">585</a> above.<p>The tabernacle in the highest sense means the Lord's Divine humanity because that is what the Temple <sup>1</sup>symbolizes, as can be seen from <a href="3927/john_2_19.htm">John 2:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_2_21.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_21_22.htm">Revelation 21:22</a>, and elsewhere. A tabernacle has a similar symbolism, with the difference that the Temple means the Lord's Divine humanity in respect to Divine truth or Divine wisdom, while a tabernacle means the Lord's Divine humanity in respect to Divine goodness or Divine love. It follows therefore that "behold, the tabernacle of God is with men" means that the Lord will now be present with people in His Divine humanity.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In Jerusalem. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 882</h4><p>882. [verse 3] 'And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold God's tabernacle is with men' signifies the Lord out of love speaking and declaring the glad tidings that He Himself is now going to be present with men in His Divine Human. This is the celestial sense of those words. The celestial angels, who are the angels of the third heaven, understand them no otherwise, for by 'to hear a great voice out of heaven saying' there is understood by them the Lord out of love speaking and declaring good tidings, because no one but the Lord speaks out of heaven; for heaven is not heaven by virtue of the propria <sup>1</sup>of the angels but from the Lord's Divine, of which they are recipients. By 'a great voice is understood speech out of love, for 'great' is predicated of love (<a href="656.htm">656</a>, <a href="663.htm">663</a>). By 'behold God's tabernacle is with men' is understood the Lord now present in His Divine Human. By 'God's tabernacle' is understood the celestial Church, and in the universal sense the Lord's celestial kingdom, and in the highest sense His Divine Human, as may be seen above (<a href="585.htm">585</a>). The reason why by 'the tabernacle' in the highest sense is understood the Lord's Divine Human is because this is signified by 'the temple,' as can be established from. <a href="3927/john_2_18.htm">John 2:18-21</a>; <a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_22.htm">Revelation 21:22</a>; and elsewhere. [This is signified] likewise by 'the tabernacle,' with the difference that by 'the temple' is understood the Lord's Divine Human as to Divine Truth or Divine Wisdom, and by 'the tabernacle' is understood the Lord's Divine Human as to Divine Good or Divine Love. It follows from this that by 'behold God's tabernacle is with men is understood that the Lord is now going to be present with men in His Divine Human. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 882</h4><p>882. Verse 3. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men signifies the Lord from love speaking and declaring the glad tidings, that he himself will now be present with men in His Divine Human. This is the celestial sense of these words. The celestial angels, who are the angels of the third heaven, understand them no otherwise, for by "hearing a great voice from heaven saying" they understand the Lord from love speaking and declaring glad tidings, because no one else speaks from heaven but the Lord; for heaven is not heaven from anything proper to the angels, but from the Divine of the Lord, of which they are recipients; by "a great voice" is meant speech from love, for "great" is predicated of love, (<a href="656.htm">656</a>, <a href="663.htm">663</a>). "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men" means that now the Lord is present in His Divine Human. By "the tabernacle of God" is meant the celestial church, and, in the universal sense, the Lord's celestial kingdom, and, in the highest sense, His Divine Human, see above, (<a href="585.htm">585</a>). The reason why the tabernacle, in the highest sense, means the Lord's Divine Human is because this is signified by "the temple," as may appear from <a href="3927/john_2_19.htm">John 2:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_2_21.htm">21</a>; <a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_22.htm">Revelation 21:22</a>; and elsewhere; the same is meant by "the tabernacle" with this difference, that by "the temple" is meant the Lord's Divine Human as to the Divine truth or the Divine wisdom, and by "the tabernacle" is meant the Lord's Divine Human as to the Divine good or the Divine love. Hence it follows, that by "behold the tabernacle of God is with men" is meant that the Lord will now be present with men in His Divine Human. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 882 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>882. (Vers. 3.) "Et audivi vocem magnam e Caelo dicentem, Ecce Tabernaculum Dei cum hominibus," significat Dominum ex amore loquentem et evangelizantem, quod 1pse nunc in Divino Humano Suo apud homines praesens futurus sit. - Hic est Sensus illorum verborum caelestis. Angeli caelestes, qui sunt angeli tertii Caeli, non aliter intelligunt illa; nam per "audire vocem magnam e Caelo dicentem," ab illis intelligitur Dominus ex amore loquens et evangelizans, quia e Caelo non alius loquitur quam Dominus; quoniam Caelum non est Caelum ex propriis angelorum, sed a Divino Domini, cujus recipientes sunt; per "vocem magnam" intelligitur loquela ex amore, "magnum" enim praedicatur de amore (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_882/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_656" target=_top>656</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_882/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_663" target=_top>663</a>); per "Ecce Tabernaculum Dei cum hominibus," intelligitur nunc Dominus in Divino Humano Suo praesens; per "Tabernaculum Dei" intelligitur Ecclesia caelestis, et in universali Sensu Regnum caeleste Domini, et in supremo Sensu Divinum Humanum Ipsius (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_882/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_585" target=_top>585</a>). Quod per "Tabernaculum" in supremo Sensu intelligatur Divinum Humanum Domini, est quia per "Templum" illud significatur (Ut constare potest ex <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_882/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_2_19" target=_top>Johannes 2:19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_882/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_2_21" target=_top>21</a>; <sup>1</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_882/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_malachi_3_1" target=_top>Malachias 3:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_882/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_22" target=_top>Apocalypsis 21:22</a>; et alibi).<p>Similiter per "Tabernaculum," cum differentia quod per "Templum" intelligatur Divinum Humanum Domini quoad Divinum Verum, seu Divinam Sapientiam, et per "Tabernaculum" intelligatur Divinum Humanum Domini quoad Divinum Bonum seu Divinum Amorem. Inde sequitur, quod per "Ecce Tabernaculum Dei cum hominibus" intelligatur quod Dominus nunc in Divino Humano Suo apud homines praesens futurus sit.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;19 pro "18" </p>
