<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第466节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>466.“披着云彩，头上有虹”表祂的属世神性和属灵神性。</p><p>祂所披着的“云彩”表示属世神性；所以“云彩”表示属世意义上的圣言，属世意义上的圣言也来自祂，因而是祂的，就是祂自己（24节）。“虹”表示属灵神性，由于属灵的在属世的之前，所以虹在头上显现。要知道，主以其属世神性而与世人同在，以其属灵神性而与其属灵国度的天使同在，以其属天神性而与属天国度的天使同在；然而，祂不是被分割了，而是照着各人的品性而向各人显现。在以西结书，主的属灵神性也以“虹”来表示：</p><p>在基路伯的穹苍之上有宝座的形像，在宝座形像上有仿佛人的形状；从祂腰间之火仿佛有下雨的日子云中虹的形状，这就是耶和华荣耀的形像。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.26.htm">1:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.28.htm">28</a>）</p><p>“宝座”表示天堂；其上的“人”就是主；“腰间之火”表示属天之爱；“虹”表示属灵的神性真理，属灵的神性真理也属于其神性智慧。在摩西五经中，经上记着说：</p><p>我把我的彩虹放在云彩中，这就可作我与地立约的记号了，我在云彩中看见它的时候，就要记念这永约。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创9.12.htm">9:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创9.17.htm">17</a>）此处“彩虹”无非表示重生之人里面属世层中的属灵神性真理；因为人在重生时，就从属世变得属灵；由于那时主与他会有一个结合，故经上说“云彩中的彩虹可作立约的记号”。“约”表示结合。显而易见，主与人不可能通过世上的彩虹结合。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 466</h4><p>466. Clothed with a cloud, with a rainbow over his head. This symbolizes His Divinity on the natural plane and His Divinity on the spiritual plane.<p>As the cloud with which the angel was clothed symbolizes the Lord's Divinity on the natural plane, therefore a cloud is used to symbolize the Word in its natural sense (no. <a href="24.htm">24</a>), which also originates from Him, and which thus pertains to Him and is Him. A rainbow symbolizes the Lord's Divinity on the spiritual plane, and because this exists above the natural plane, the rainbow was therefore seen over the angel's head.<p>It must be known that the Lord is present with people in His Divinity on the natural plane, with angels of the spiritual kingdom in His Divinity on the spiritual plane, and with angels of the celestial kingdom in His Divinity on the celestial plane. Still, He Himself is not partitioned, but He appears to each person in accordance with that person's character.<p>The Lord's Divinity on the spiritual plane is also symbolized by a rainbow in Ezekiel:<p>Above the expanse (of the cherubim)...was the likeness of a throne..., and (on it)...the appearance of a man... ...and from (the fire of) His loins... as it were... the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day... This was the appearance of... the glory of Jehovah. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26-28</a>).<p>The throne symbolizes heaven; the man on it, the Lord; the fire of His loins, celestial love; and the rainbow, Divine truth on the spiritual plane, which has to do also with His Divine wisdom.<p>We read of a rainbow also in Genesis:<p>I have set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be for the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth. And... when I (see it)...in the cloud, I will remember... the eternal covenant... (<a href="3927/genesis_9_12.htm">Genesis 9:12-17</a>)<p>Nothing else is meant by the rainbow here but Divine truth on the spiritual plane present in the natural one in a person who is being regenerated. For when a person is being regenerated, from being natural he is becoming spiritual. And because he has a conjunction of the Lord with him then, therefore we are told that the bow in the cloud would serve as sign of the covenant, a covenant symbolizing conjunction. Rainbows in the world are clearly not a means of conjunction of the Lord with man. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 466</h4><p>466. 'Encompassed with a cloud, and a rainbow overhead' signifies His Natural Divine and Spiritual Divine. By the 'cloud' with which He was encompassed is signified the Natural Divine; and therefore the Word in the natural sense, which also is from Himself thus is His and Himself is signified by 'cloud' (<a href="24.htm">24</a>). By the 'rainbow' is signified the Spiritual Divine, and because this is above the Natural therefore the rainbow was seen overhead. It must be known that the Lord in His Natural Divine is with men, but in the Spiritual Divine with the angels of the spiritual kingdom, and in the Celestial Divine with the angels of the celestial kingdom. Nevertheless He is not divided, but appears to each one in accordance with his quality. The Lord's Spiritual Divine is also signified by the 'rainbow' in Ezekiel:<p>Above the expanse of the cherubs the likeness of a throne, and upon that a view of a Man, and out of the fire of His loins as it were a view of the rainbow that is in a cloud on a day of rain, this is a view of the glory of Jehovah. <a href="3927/ezekiel_1_26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26-28</a>.<p>By the 'throne' is signified heaven; by the 'Man' upon it the Lord; by 'the fire of His loins' celestial love; and by 'the rainbow' spiritual Divine Truth, which also is of His Divine Wisdom. By the rainbow, of which these things [are said] in Moses:<p>I have set My bow in the cloud, which shall be in token of the covenant between Me and the land, and when I shall see it in the cloud, I will remember the eternal covenant. <a href="3927/genesis_9_12.htm">Genesis 9:12-17</a>; nothing else is understood but spiritual Divine Truth in the natural with a man who is being regenerated; for a man, when he is being regenerated, from [being] natural is made spiritual; and because there is then a conjunction of the Lord with him it is therefore said that the bow would be in the cloud 'in token of the covenant.' The 'covenant' signifies conjunction. That there is not any conjunction of the Lord with the man by means of the rainbows in the world is plain. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 466</h4><p>466. Encompassed with a cloud; and a rainbow was over His head, signifies His Divine natural and Divine spiritual. By "the cloud" with which He was encompassed, is signified the Divine natural; wherefore the Word in its natural sense, which also is from Him, thus is His and Himself, is signified by "cloud" (<a href="24.htm">24</a>). By "the rainbow" is signified the Divine spiritual, and as this is above the natural, therefore the rainbow appeared over the head. It is to be known, that the Lord is present with men in His Divine natural, but, with the angels of His spiritual kingdom, in His Divine spiritual, and with the angels of His celestial kingdom, in His Divine celestial; still He is not divided, but appears to everyone according to his quality. The Lord's Divine spiritual is also signified by the rainbow in Ezekiel:<p>And above the expanse of the cherubim was the likeness of a throne, and upon it the appearance of a man; and from the fire of His loins there was as it were the appearance of the rainbow which is in the cloud in the day of rain, this was the appearance of the glory of Jehovah, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26-28</a>).<p>By "the throne" is signified heaven; by "the man upon it" the Lord; by "the fire of the loins," celestial love; and by "the rainbow," Divine truth spiritual, which also is of His Divine wisdom. It is written in Moses:<p>I have set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth, and when I shall see it in the cloud, I will remember the eternal covenant, (<a href="3927/genesis_9_12.htm">Genesis 9:12-17</a>).<p>By "the rainbow" here nothing else is meant but the Divine truth spiritual in the natural with the man who is regenerated; for man, when he is regenerated, from natural becomes spiritual; and in as much as there is then a conjunction of the Lord with him, therefore it is said, that the bow in the cloud should be for "a sign of the covenant.""Covenant" signifies conjunction. That there is no conjunction of the Lord with man by rainbows in the world, is evident. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 466 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>466. "Circumdatum nube et iris Supra caput," significat Divinum Naturale et Divinum Spirituale Ipsius. - Per "nubem," qua circumdatus, significatur Divinum Naturale; quare Verbum in Sensu naturali, quod etiam est ab Ipso, ita Ipsius et Ipse, significatur per "nubem (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_466/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_24" target=_top>24</a>); per "iridem" significatur Divinum Spirituale, quod quia est supra Naturale, ideo Iris visa est supra caput. Sciendum est, quod Dominus in Divino Suo Naturali sit apud homines, in Divino autem Spirituali apud Angelos Regni spiritualis, et in Divino Caelesti apud Angelos Regni caelestis; sed usque non est divisus, at apparet cuique secundum quale ejus. Divinum Spirituale Domini etiam significatur per "iridem" apud Ezechielem: <p>Super expanso Cheruborum "similitudo Throni, et super illo aspectus Hominis: et ex igne lumborum Ejus sicut aspectus Iridis quae in nube in die pluviae; hic aspectus gloriae Jehovae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_466/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_1_26-28" target=_top>1:26-28</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>per 'Thronum" significatur Caelum, per "Hominem super illo" Dominus, per "ignem lumborum" amor caelestis, et per "iridem" Divinum Verum spirituale, quod etiam est Divinae Sapientiae Ipsius. Per "iridem," de qua haec apud Mosen, <p>"Arcum Meum dedi in nube, qui erit in signum foederis inter Me et inter Terram:" et cum videro illum in nube, "recordabor foederis aeterni," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_466/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_9_12-17" target=_top>Genesis 9:12-17</a>), <p>non aliud intelligitur quam Divinum Verum spirituale in naturali apud hominem qui regeneratur, fit enim homo, cum regeneratur, a naturali spiritualis; et quia tunc est conjunctio Domini cum illo, ideo dicitur, quod arcus in nube esset "in Signum foederis." "Foedus" significat conjunctionem. Quod non aliqua conjunctio Domini cum homine sit per irides in mundo, patet.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;26-28 pro "26, 28, 29" </p>
