<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第580节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>580.“也拜兽”表普通民众承认这是一个神圣真理，即没有人能凭自己行出善行，也不能全守律法。“拜”表示承认是教会的神圣事物，如刚才所述（<a href="579.htm">579</a>节），在此表示承认这是一个神圣真理，即没有人能凭自己行出善行，也不能全守律法；由于这二者被视为神圣真理，故可知，律法的行为要从信仰被除去，因为它们对救恩没有作用。但这些真理，连同其它许多真理一起被歪曲了（参看<a href="566.htm">566</a>节）。</p><p>由于接受和承认，“兽”在此和“龙”所表相同；故经上说他们“拜龙”，“也拜兽”。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 580</h4><p>580. And they worshiped the beast. This symbolizes an acknowledgment by the general populace that it is a sacred truth that no one can do any good work of himself or fulfill the law.<p>To worship means, symbolically, to acknowledge as a sacred tenet of the church, as said just above in no. <a href="579.htm">579</a>, here that it is a sacred truth that no one can do any good work of himself or fulfill the law. And because these two truths are sacred truths, it follows that works of the law must be dissociated from faith as being not saving. But these truths have been falsified, along with a number of others, as may be seen in no. <a href="566.htm">566</a> above.<p>The beast here has the same symbolism as the dragon, because of the acceptance and acknowledgment of the doctrine. So we are told that they worshiped the dragon and worshiped the beast. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 580</h4><p>580. 'And they adored the beast' signifies the acknowledgment by the community at large that it is a holy truth (veritas) that no one can do a good work by himself, nor fulfil the law. By 'to adore' is signified to acknowledge as a holy thing of the Church, as just above (<a href="579.htm">579</a>), here that it is a holy truth (veritas) that no one can do a good work by himself, and fulfil the law; and because these two are [considered as] holy truths, it follows that the works of the law are to be removed from faith, as not effecting salvation. But that these truths together with many others have been falsified may be seen above (<a href="566.htm">566</a>). By 'the beast' here is signified the same as by 'the dragon,' on account of reception and acknowledgment; and it is therefore said that 'they adored the dragon' and 'they adored the beast. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 580</h4><p>580. And they adored the beast, signifies the acknowledgment by the common people that it is holy truth, that no one can do good works from himself, nor fulfill the law. "To adore" signifies to acknowledge it as holy in the church, as above, (<a href="579.htm">579</a>), here, to acknowledge it as holy truth, that no one can do good works of himself, and fulfil the law; and these two being regarded as holy truths, it follows, that the works of the law are to be removed from faith, as not saving. But that these truths, and many others, are falsified, may be seen above, (<a href="566.htm">566</a>). By "the beast" is here signified the same as by "the dragon," on account of the reception and acknowledgment; therefore it is said that they "adored the dragon," and "adored the beast." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 580 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>580. "Et adoraverunt Bestiam," significat agnitionem communi caetu, quod sancta veritas sit, quod nemo a se possit facere bonum opus, - nec implere Legem. - Per "adorare" significatur pro sancto Ecclesiae agnoscere, ut mox supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_580/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_579" target=_top>579</a>), hic quod sit sancta veritas, quod nemo possit a se facere bonum opus, ac implere Legem; et quia haec duo sanctae veritates sunt, sequitur quod opera Legis removenda sint a Fide, ut non salvifica: sed quod hae veritates, una cum pluribus aliis, falsificatae sint, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_580/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_566" target=_top>566</a>). Per "Bestiam" hic significatur simile quod per "Draconem," propter receptionem et agnitionem; quare dicitur quod "adoraverint Draconem," et "adoraverint Bestiam." </p>
