<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第312节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>312.“我就观看，见有一匹黑马”表在真理、因而在教义方面，这些人完全丧失了对圣言的理解。如前所述，“马”表示对圣言的理解；“黑”之所以表示非真理，因而表示虚假，是因为“黑”是“白”的对立面，而“白”论及真理（<a href="167.htm">167</a>，<a href="231.htm">231</a>，<a href="232.htm">232</a>节）；白源于光，黑源于暗，因而源于光的缺失，而光是真理。但在灵界，黑有双重来源，一个源于火焰之光的缺失，主的属天国度的居民便在这光中；另一个源于亮光的缺失，主的属灵国度的居民便在这光中；后一种“黑”和“暗”（darkness）的含义相同，而前一种“黑”和“幽暗”（thick darkness）的含义相同。这两种“黑”是有区别的，一种是可憎的，另一种则不那么可憎；它们所表示的虚假也一样。显现在可憎之黑中的，被称为魔鬼。事实上，他们憎恶真理，就像角枭（horned owl）憎恶阳光。而显现在不那么可憎之黑中的，则被称为撒旦。这些人不憎恶真理，只是讨厌它；所以后者好比猫头鹰，而前者则好比角枭。在圣言中，“黑”论及虚假。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>锡安的拿细耳人素来比雪纯净，现在他们的面貌比黑人更黑。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.7.htm">4:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.8.htm">8</a>）</p><p>白昼向先知变为黑暗。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥3.6.htm">3:6</a>）</p><p>下阴间的那日，我要使黎巴嫩向你变为黑暗。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.15.htm">31:15</a>）</p><p>日头变黑像毛布。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.12.htm">6:12</a>）</p><p>日月星辰都变黑（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.27.htm">4:27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.28.htm">28</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.7.htm">32:7</a>；约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.10.htm">2:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.15.htm">3:15</a>等）</p><p>“第三个活物”之所以显为“黑马”，是因为它有一张像人的脸，而人的脸表示圣言神性真理的智慧（<a href="243.htm">243</a>节），因此该活物表明，按照顺序，第三类人不再有任何智慧之真理。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 312</h4><p>312. So I looked, and behold, a black horse. This symbolizes an understanding of the Word among them extinguished as to truth, thus extinguished as regards their doctrine.<p>We showed above that a horse symbolizes an understanding of the Word. Blackness symbolizes a lack of truth, thus falsity, because blackness is the opposite of whiteness, and whiteness is predicated of truth (nos. <a href="167.htm">167</a>, <a href="231.htm">231</a>, <a href="232.htm">232</a>). Whiteness is also the result of light, while blackness results from darkness, thus from the absence of light, and light means truth.<p>In the spiritual world, however, blackness has a double origin, one resulting from the absence of a flaming light, the light possessed by inhabitants of the Lord's celestial kingdom, and the other resulting from the absence of a bright white light, the light possessed by inhabitants of the Lord's spiritual kingdom. The first kind of blackness has the same symbolism as a thick darkness, the second the same as a gloomy darkness. The two kinds differ from each other. One is dreadful, the other not so dreadful. It is the same with the falsities that they symbolize. The spirits who appear in a terrible darkness are called devils. They also abhor truth as owls do the light of the sun. In contrast, the spirits who appear in a darkness that is not so dreadful are called satanic spirits. They do not abhor truth, though they are still averse to it, and therefore they may be likened to barn owls, but the first to eagle owls.<p>The fact that blackness in the Word is predicated of falsity can be seen from the following passages:<p>Her Nazirites were brighter than snow... Darkened more than blackness is their form. (<a href="3927/lamentations_4_7.htm">Lamentations 4:7-8</a>)<p>...on the prophets... the day shall grow black. (<a href="3927/micah_3_6.htm">Micah 3:6</a>)<p>On the day that you go down to hell..., I will make Lebanon dark over you... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_31_15.htm">Ezekiel 31:15</a>)<p>...the sun became as black as sackcloth of goat's hair... (<a href="3927/revelation_6_12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>)<p>The sun, moon and stars are darkened in <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27-28</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_32_7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a>, <a href="3927/joel_2_10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="3927/joel_3_15.htm">3:15</a>, and elsewhere.<p>It was the third living creature that displayed the black horse because it had a face like a human being, which symbolized the Divine truth of the Word in respect to its wisdom (no. <a href="243.htm">243</a>). Consequently it was this living creature that displayed the fact that there was no longer any truth of wisdom in the people who were third in order. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 312</h4><p>312. 'And I saw, and behold a black horse' signifies the understanding of the Word utterly lost as to truth, thus as to the doctrine with those. That a 'horse' signifies the understanding of the Word has been shown above; that 'black' signifies what is not true, thus untruth, is because black is opposite to white, and white is predicated of truth (<a href="167.htm">167</a>, <a href="231.htm">231-232</a>); white in fact draws its origin out of light, whereas black does so out of darkness, thus out of an absence of light, and light is truth. In the spiritual world, however, blackness exists out of a two-fold origin, one out of an absence of the flamy light that is the light with those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom, and the other out of an absence of the shining white light that is with those who are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom. The latter blackness signifies that which is like darkness, but the former that which is like thick-darkness. These blacknesses differ from each other. The one is abominable, the other not so. The untruths that they signify differ in like manner. In the abominable blackness appear those who are called devils. Indeed they abhor truth as horned-owls abhor the light of the sun. In the non-abominable darkness, however, appear those who are called satans. These do not abhor truth, but are averse to it. Therefore the latter can be compared to night-owls, when the former are compared to horned-owls. That 'black' in the Word is said of untruth, can be established from these passages:<p>Her Nazirites were whiter than snow, their form has been darkened more than blackness, <a href="3927/lamentations_4_7.htm">Lamentations 4:7-8</a>.<p>The day shall grow black over the prophets. <a href="3927/micah_3_6.htm">Micah 3:6</a>.<p>In the day in which thou art about to go down into hell, I will make Lebanon black over thee. <a href="3927/ezekiel_31_15.htm">Ezekiel 31:15</a>.<p>The sun became black as a goat-hair sack. <a href="3927/revelation_6_12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>.<p>The sun, the moon, the stars, became black. <a href="3927/jeremiah_4_27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27-28</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_32_7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a>; <a href="3927/joel_2_10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="3927/joel_3_15.htm">3:15</a> [H.B. 4:15]; and elsewhere. The 'third animal' exposed the 'black horse' to view, because that animal had a face like a man, by which the Divine Truth of the Word as to wisdom is signified (<a href="243.htm">243</a>). Therefore this animal exposed to view the fact that there was no longer any truth of wisdom with those who were the third in order. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 312</h4><p>312. And I saw, and behold, a black horse, signifies the understanding of the Word destroyed as to truth, thus as to doctrine with these. That "a horse" signifies the understanding of the Word, was shown above; the reason why "black" signifies what is not true, thus falsity, is because black is the opposite of white, and white is predicated of truth, (<a href="167.htm">167</a>[1-2], <a href="231.htm">231</a>, <a href="232.htm">232</a>); white also derives its origin from light, and black from darkness, thus from the absence of light, and light is truth. But in the spiritual world there exists blackness from a twofold origin, one from the absence of flaming light, which light is with those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom, and the other from the absence of bright light, which is the light with those who are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom; the latter blackness has the same signification as "darkness," but the former as "thick darkness." There is a difference between these two kinds of blackness, the one is abominable, the other not so much so; it is the same with the falsities which they signify. They who appear in the abominable kind of blackness are called devils, such holding truth in abomination as horned owls do the light of the sun. But they appear in that kind of blackness, which is not abominable, who are called satans; these do not abominate truth, but are averse to it; the latter may therefore be compared to owls, and the former to horned owls. That "black," in the Word, is spoken of falsity, may appear from these passages:<p>Her Nazarites were whiter than snow, their form is darkened more than blackness, (<a href="3927/lamentations_4_7.htm">Lamentations 4:7-8</a>).<p>The day shall grow black over the prophets, (<a href="3927/micah_3_6.htm">Micah 3:6</a>).<p>In the day when thou goest down into hell, I will make Lebanon black over thee, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_31_15.htm">Ezekiel 31:15</a>).<p>The sun became black as sackcloth of hair, (<a href="3927/revelation_6_12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>).<p>The sun, the moon, and the stars, became black, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_4_27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27-28</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_32_7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a>; <a href="3927/joel_2_10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="3927/joel_3_15.htm">3:15</a>).<p>The reason why "the third animal" showed "a black horse," was, because it had a face like a man, by which is signified the Divine truth of the Word as to wisdom, (<a href="243.htm">243</a>), therefore this animal showed that there was no longer any truth of wisdom with those who were the third in order. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 312 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>312. "Et vidi, et ecce Equus niger," significat intellectum Verbi deperditum quoad verum, ita quoad doctrinam apud hos. Quod "equus" significet intellectum Verbi, supra ostensum est; quod "nigrum" significet non verum, ita falsum, est quia nigrum est oppositum albo, et album praedicatur de vero (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_312/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_167" target=_top>167</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_312/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_231" target=_top>231</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_312/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_232" target=_top>232</a>); <sup>1</sup>album etiam trahit ortum ex luce, ac nigrum ex tenebris, ita ex absentia lucis, et lux est verum. Sed in mundo spirituali est nigredo ex duplici origine; una ex absentia lucis flammeae, quae lux est apud illos qui in caelesti regno Domini sunt, et altera ex absentia lucis candidae, quae lux est apud illos qui in regno spirituali Domini sunt; haec nigredo simile significat cum "tenebris," illa autem cum "caligine." Differunt illae nigredines inter se, una est abominabilis, altera non ita; similiter falsitates quas significant. In nigredine abominabili apparent illi qui vocantur Diaboli; abominantur etiam verum sicut bubones solis lucem. In nigredine autem non abominabili apparent illi qui vocantur Satanae; hi non abominantur, sed aversantur verum, quare hi comparari possunt noctuis, cum priores bubonibus. Quod "nigrum" in Verbo dicatur de falso, constare potest ex his locis: <p>"Albi erant Naziraei prae nive; obscurata est prae Nigredine forma eorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_312/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_lamentations_4_7-8" target=_top>Threni 4:7-8</a>);<p>"Super prophetis Nigrescet dies," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_312/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_micah_3_6" target=_top>Micham 3:6</a>);<p>"In die quo descensurus es in Infernum, Atrabo super te Libanum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_312/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_31_15" target=_top>Ezechiel 31:15</a>);<p>"Sol factus est Niger sicut saccus cilicinus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_312/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_6_12" target=_top>Apocalypsis 6:12</a>);<p>Sol, Luna, Stellae, atrati sunt, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_312/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_4_27-28" target=_top>Jeremias 4:27-28</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_312/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_32_7" target=_top>Ezechiel 32:7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_312/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joel_2_10" target=_top>Joel 2:10</a>; <sup>2</sup>4:15 (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_312/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joel_3_15" target=_top>3:15</a>); et alibi).<p>Quod "tertium Animal" ostenderit "equum nigrum," erat quia illud habebat faciem sicut homo, per quod significabatur Divinum Verum Verbi quoad sapientiam (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_312/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_243" target=_top>243</a>) quare hoc Animal ostendit, quod non amplius aliquod verum sapientiae apud hos, qui in tertio ordine, esset.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;231, 232 pro "232, 233"<p>2.&nbsp;10 pro "20" </p>
