<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第708节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>708.启16:17.“第七位天使把他的香瓶倒在空中”表流注从主进入改革宗教会之人所具有的总体上的一切事物里面。“第七位天使倒香瓶”在此和前面一样，表示流注。“空（气）”（air）表示觉察和思维、因而其信仰的一切事物；因而还表示那里所有那些陷入与仁分离之信之人的总体性质；因为“空气”表示他们的呼吸；而呼吸对应于理解或认知，因而对于觉察与思维，也对应于信仰；因为信仰照着对理解或认知的觉察而属于思维。这种对应是存在的，在灵界，人人都照其信仰而呼吸，这一事实在《圣爱与圣智》第五章有充分说明。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 708</h4><p>708. <a href="3927/revelation_16_17.htm">16:17</a> Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air. This symbolizes influx from the Lord into all of these things at the same time in people of the Protestant Reformed Church.<p>The seventh angel's pouring out his bowl symbolizes, here as before, influx. The air symbolizes the whole scope of their perception and thought, thus of their faith, and consequently also the character generally of all those people in that church caught up in a faith divorced from charity. For air symbolizes their respiration, and respiration corresponds to the intellect, thus to perception and thought, and also faith, because faith is a matter of thought in accordance with the intellect's perception. The existence of this correspondence, and the fact that everyone in the spiritual world breathes in a way that reflects his faith, has been fully shown in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom, Part Five. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 708</h4><p>708. [verse 17] 'And the seventh angel poured out his phial into the air' signifies an influx from the Lord into all the things at once with the men of the Reformed Church. By 'the seventh angel pouring out his phial' is signified, here as by the previous times, an influx. By 'the air' is signified all things of perception and thought, thus of their faith; therefore also what in general all who are in faith separated from charity there are like. For by 'the air' is signified their breathing, and breathing corresponds to the understanding, thus to perception and thought, and also to faith, because faith is of thought in accordance with the understanding's perception. That this correspondence exists, and that in the spiritual world everyone breathes in accordance with his faith, has been fully shown in ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM, in the Fifth Part. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 708</h4><p>708. Verse 17. And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air, signifies influx from the Lord into all things collectively with the men of the church of the Reformed. By "the seventh angel pouring out his vial" is here signified influx as before. By "the air" is signified all the things of perception and thought, thus of their faith; thence also the general quality of all those there, who are in faith separate from charity: for by "the air" their respiration is signified; and respiration corresponds to the understanding, and thus to perception and thought, and also to faith; because faith is of thought according to the perception of the understanding. That there is this correspondence, and that everyone in the spiritual world breathes according to his faith, as been fully shown in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom, in chapter 5 <a href="../dlw/371.htm">371-431</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 708 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>708. (Vers. 17.) "Et septimus Angelum effudit phialam suam in aerem," significat influxum a Domino in omnia simul apud homines Ecclesiae Reformatorum. - Per "septimum Angelum effundentem phialam suam" significatur, hic ut per priores, influxus; per "aerem significantur omnia perceptionis et cogitationis, ita fidei eorum, proinde etiam quales in communi sunt omnes qui in Fide separata a Charitate ibi sunt; nam per "aerem" significatur respiratio eorum, et respiratio correspondet intellectui, ita perceptioni et cogitationi, et quoque fidei, quia fides est cogitationis secundum perceptionem intellectus; quod haec correspondentia sit, et quod in mundo spirituali quisque respiret secundum suam fidem, in Sapientia Angelica de Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia, in Parte Quinta, plene ostensum est. </p>
