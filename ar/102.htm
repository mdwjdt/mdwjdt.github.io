<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第102节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>102.“你务要至死忠心”表对真理的接受和承认，直到虚假被移走，仿佛被清除。就属世之义而言，“你务要至死忠心”表示他们务要忠心，直至生命结束。但就属灵之义而言，则表示他们必须接受并承认真理，直至虚假被它们移走，仿佛被清除。因为这层含义适合在灵界者，灵界没有死亡。因此，“死”在此表示其试探的结束。之所以说它们仿佛被清除，是因为人的邪恶与虚假并非真的被清除了，而只是被移走了。它们被移走了，就仿佛被清除了，因为当邪恶与虚假被移走时，主便将人保守在良善与真理中。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 102</h4><p>102. "'Be faithful until death.'" This symbolizes their reception and acknowledgment of truths until their falsities are removed and seemingly eradicated.<p>"Be faithful until death" means, in the natural sense, that they are not to turn away from their faithfulness until the end of their life, but in the spiritual sense it means that they will receive and acknowledge truths until the truths remove their falsities and seemingly eradicate them. For the spiritual sense is rightly for people in the spiritual world, for whom there is no death. Consequently death here means the end of their temptation or trial.<p>We say until their falsities are seemingly eradicated, because the falsities and evils in a person are never eradicated but set aside; and when they have been set aside they appear as though eradicated, because with the setting aside of evils and falsities a person is kept focused on goods and truths by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 102</h4><p>102. Be thou faithful even unto death' signifies a reception and acknowledgment of truths (veritas) until untruths have been removed and, as it were, abolished. By 'Be thou faithful unto death' in the natural sense is understood that to the end of life they are not going to lapse from faithfulness; but in the spiritual sense is understood that they are going to be receiving and acknowledging truths (veritas) until by their means untruths have been removed and, as it were, abolished. For this sense is properly for those who are in the spiritual world, for whom there is not any death, and therefore by 'death' here is understood the end of their temptation. It is said 'until they are, as it were, abolished,' because the untruths and evils with a man are not abolished, but removed; and when they have been removed they appear as though abolished, because when the evils and untruths have been removed the man is kept in goods and truths by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 102</h4><p>102. Be thou faithful unto death, signifies reception and acknowledgment of truths, until falsities are removed, and as it were abolished. By "be thou faithful unto death," in the natural sense, is meant, that they must not depart from fidelity even to the end of life; but in the spiritual sense, that they must receive and acknowledge truths, even until falsities are removed by them, and as it were abolished; for this sense is properly for those who are in the spiritual world, for whom there is no death. Therefore by "death" is here meant the end of their temptation. It is said, until they are, as it were, abolished, because falsities and evils with man are not abolished, but removed, and when they are removed they appear as if they were abolished, because when evils and falsities are removed, man is kept in goods and truths by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 102 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>102. "Esto fidelis usque ad mortem," significat receptionem et agnitionem veritatum, usque dum falsa remota sunt, et quasi abolita. - Per "esto fidelis usque ad mortem" in Sensu naturali intelligitur, quod a fidelitate non recessuri sint usque ad finem vitae; sed in Sensu spirituali, quod recepturi et agnituri sint veritates, usque dum falsa per illas remota sunt, et quasi abolita; hic enim Sensus est proprie pro illis qui in spirituali mundo sunt, quibus non aliqua mors est; quare per mortem hic intelligitur finis tentationis illorum. Dicitur usque dum "quasi" abolita sunt, quia falsa et mala apud hominem non abolentur, sed removentur; et cum remota sunt apparent tanquam abolita, quia remotis malis et falsis homo tenetur in bonis et veris a Domino. </p>
