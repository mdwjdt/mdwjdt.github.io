<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第327节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>327.“说，圣洁真实的主啊！你不审判住在地上的人给我们伸流血的冤，要等到几时呢”表由于最后审判延迟，那些向圣言和主的神性施暴的人没有被移除。“主啊，你不审判要等到几时呢”表示最后的审判为何延迟呢？“不给我们伸流血的冤”表示那些因承认主的神性人并照其圣言的真理生活而向他们施暴的人为何不照公义受宣判呢？“血”表示向他们所施的暴力（<a href="379.htm">379</a>节）；“住在地上的人”表示灵人界的恶者，他们受到保护，以免被这些恶者伤害。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 327</h4><p>327. Saying, "How long, O Lord, who are holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?" This symbolically means, over the fact that the Last Judgment was so long delayed, and that those who did violence to the Word and to the Lord's Divinity were not being removed.<p>"How long, O Lord, will You not judge" means, symbolically, "Why is the Last Judgment delayed?" And "how long will You not avenge our blood" means symbolically, "Why in accordance with justice are those not condemned who have done violence to them because of their acknowledgment of the Lord's Divine humanity and their life according to the truths of His Word?" Blood symbolizes the violence done to them (no. <a href="379.htm">379</a>).<p>"Those who dwell on the earth" mean evil people in the world of spirits, from whom they were being protected so as not to be harmed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 327</h4><p>327. 'Saying, How long, O Lord, [Who art Holy and True,] dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on those dwelling upon the land?' signifies over the fact that the last judgment is deferred, and that those who inflict violence on the Word and the Lord's Divine are not being removed. 'How long, O Lord, dost Thou not judge' signifies, Why is the last judgment delayed? 'And avenge our blood' signifies, Why by reason of justice are they not condemned who inflict violence on them for the acknowledgment of the Lord's Divine Human and for a life in accordance with the truths of His Word? By 'blood' is signified the violence inflicted on them (<a href="379.htm">379</a>): by 'those dwelling upon the land' are understood the evil in the world of spirits from whom they have been protected lest they be hurt. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 327</h4><p>327. Saying, How long, O Lord, <sup>1</sup>dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? signifies, by reason that the Last Judgment is delayed, and they who offer violence to the Word and to the Lord's Divine Human are not removed. "How long, O Lord, dost Thou not judge," signifies, why is the Last Judgment delayed? "and avenge our blood," signifies, why in justice are they not condemned, who have offered them violence for acknowledging the Lord's Divine Human, and for living according to the truths of His Word? By "blood" is signified violence offered to them, (<a href="379.htm">379</a>[1-7]) "them that dwell on the earth," are meant the evil in the world of spirits, from whom they were guarded that they might not be hurt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original Latin omits "Who are holy and true." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 327 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>327. "Dicentes, Usque quo Domine, (Qui Sanctus et Verus,) non judicas et vindicas sanguinem nostrum de habitantibus super terram," significat super id quod Ultimum Judicium protrahatur, et non removeantur <sup>1</sup>qui violentiam inferunt Verbo et Divino Domini. -"Usque quo Domine non judicas," significat cur Ultimum Judicium protrahitur; "et vindicas sanguinem nostrum" significat cur non ex justitia condemnantur illi, qui violentiam illis intulerunt, propter agnitionem Divini Humani Domini, et propter vitam secundum vera Verbi Ipsius; per "sanguinem" significatur violentia illis illata (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_327/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_379" target=_top>379</a>); per "habitantes super terra" intelliguntur mali in mundo spirituum, a quibus ne laedantur custoditi sunt.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;removeantur pro "removentur" </p>
