<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>233.“宝座的周围又有二十四个座位，我看见二十四位长老坐在宝座上”表为预备最后审判而对天堂中一切事物的安排。凡不知道圣言的灵义，同时也不知道教会的纯正真理的人，会以为当最后审判将要到来时，主会坐在宝座上，祂周围还会有其他审判者坐在宝座上。而凡知道圣言的灵义，同时也知道教会的纯正真理的人，都知道到那时，主不会坐在宝座上，祂周围也不会有其他审判者，而且主也不会将任何人判入地狱，而是圣言审判每个人，主只是审核，以便一切事都照着公义来审判。事实上，主说：</p><p>父不审判什么人，乃将审判的事全交与子，并且因为祂是人子，就赐给祂行审判的权柄。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约 5.22.htm"> 5:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约 5.27.htm">27</a>）</p><p>但在另一处祂却说：</p><p>我来本不是要审判世界，乃是要拯救世界；我所讲的道，在末日要审判他。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.47.htm">12:47</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.48.htm">48</a>）</p><p>这两处经文并不矛盾，只要知道“人子”是指主的圣言（参看<a href="44.htm">44</a>节）；因此，审判的是圣言，主只是审核。</p><p>以色列十二支派及其长老表示属于主在天上和地上教会的所有人，抽象而言，表示教会的一切真理和良善（参看<a href="251.htm">251</a>，<a href="349.htm">349</a>，<a href="369.htm">369</a>，<a href="808.htm">808</a>节）；十二使徒所表相同（<a href="79.htm">79</a>，<a href="790.htm">790</a>，<a href="903.htm">903</a>节）。由此明显可知主的这些话是什么意思：</p><p>耶稣对门徒说，你们这跟从我的人，当人子坐在祂荣耀的宝座上的时候，你们也要坐在十二个宝座上，审判以色列十二个支派。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.28.htm">19:28</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.30.htm">22:30</a>）</p><p>“十二”表全部，论及天堂和教会的真理和良善（<a href="348.htm">348</a>节）；“二十四”所表相同。因此，“十二使徒”和“二十四位长老”表示教会的一切事物；“十二个宝座”和“二十四个宝座”表示审判的全部。谁不明白，使徒和长老不会审判，也不能审判？由此明显可知，为何当论述审判时，经上会提及“宝座”和“长老”。如以赛亚书：</p><p>耶和华必审问祂民中的长老。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.14.htm">3:14</a>）</p><p>诗篇：</p><p>耶路撒冷被建造，众支派上那里去；在那里设立审判的宝座。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗122.3.htm">122:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗122.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p>启示录：</p><p>我又看见几个宝座，也有坐在上面的，并有审判的权柄赐给他们。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.4.htm">20:4</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 233</h4><p>233. Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting. (<a href="3927/revelation_4_4.htm">4:4</a>) This symbolizes the organization of everything in heaven for the Last Judgment.<p>Someone unacquainted with the spiritual meaning of the Word and at the same time the genuine truths of the church may believe that when the time of the Last Judgment comes, the Lord will sit upon a throne, and will be surrounded by other judges, also on thrones. But someone who is acquainted with the Word's spiritual meaning and at the same time the church's genuine truths knows that the Lord will not then sit upon a throne, nor be surrounded by other judges - indeed, that neither will the Lord judge anyone to hell, but that He will occasion the Word to judge everyone, under His oversight to ensure that everything proceeds in accordance with justice. The Lord in fact says,<p>...the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son... ...He has given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man. (<a href="3927/john_5_22.htm">John 5:22</a>, <a href="3927/john_5_27.htm">27</a>)</p><p>[2] But elsewhere He says,<p>I did not come to judge the world but to save the world... The Word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day. (<a href="3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>)<p>These two statements are in harmony when one knows that the Son of Man is the Lord in relation to the Word (see no. <a href="44.htm">44</a> above). Consequently it is the Word that will judge, under the Lord's oversight.<p>To be shown that the twelve tribes of Israel and their elders symbolize all people who are part of the Lord's church in heaven and on earth, and in an abstract sense all the truths and goods in it, see nos. <a href="251.htm">251</a>, <a href="349.htm">349</a>, <a href="369.htm">369</a>, <a href="808.htm">808</a>. That the like is meant by apostles, nos. <a href="79.htm">79</a>, <a href="790.htm">790</a>, <a href="903.htm">903</a>.<p>It is apparent from this what the symbolic meaning is of these words of the Lord:<p>Jesus said to (His disciples), ."..when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." (<a href="3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>, cf. <a href="3927/luke_22_30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>)<p>The number twelve symbolizes all, and it is predicated of the truths and goods of heaven and the church (no. <a href="348.htm">348</a>). So, too, the number twenty-four. Therefore the twelve apostles and the twenty-four elders symbolize all the constituents of the church, and the twelve disciples, as also the twenty-four thrones, symbolize all judgment. Who cannot understand that the apostles and elders are not going to judge, and are unable to do so?<p>From this it can now be seen why thrones and elders are mentioned where the subject is judgment, as also in Isaiah:<p>Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of His people... (<a href="3927/isaiah_3_14.htm">Isaiah 3:14</a>)<p>In the book of Psalms:<p>Jerusalem is built...(and) to it the tribes go up... ...thrones are set there for judgment... (<a href="3927/psalms_122_3.htm">Psalms 122:3-5</a>)<p>And in the book of Revelation:<p>I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was turned over to them. (<a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 233</h4><p>233. [verse 4] 'And around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting' signifies the setting of all in heaven in order for the last judgment. He who is not acquainted with the spiritual sense of the Word, and genuine truths of the Church at the same time, is able to believe that when the last judgment comes, the Lord will be seated upon a throne, and that other judges will also be on thrones around Him. He, however, who is acquainted with the spiritual sense of the Word and genuine truths of the Church at the same time, knows that the Lord will not then be seated upon a throne, nor will there be other judges around Him. On the contrary, he knows that the Lord is not going to judge anyone to hell, but that He is going to cause the Word to judge each one, Himself controlling all things so that they are effected in accordance with justice. In fact the Lord says:<p>The Father does not judge anyone, but has given all judgment to the Son: He has given [Him] the ability to effect judgment, because He is the Son of Man. <a href="3927/john_5_22.htm">John 5:22</a>, <a href="3927/john_5_27.htm">27</a>.<p>But elsewhere He says:<p>I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world: the Word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. <a href="3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>.<p>These two [statements] agree, when it is known that the Son of Man is the Lord as to the Word (see above, <a href="44.htm">44</a>). Therefore the Word is going to judge, with the Lord controlling.</p><p>[2] That by the twelve tribes of Israel and their elders are signified all who belong to the Lord's Church in the heavens and on earth (in terris), and abstractly all the truths and goods there, may be seen (<a href="251.htm">251</a>, <a href="349.htm">349</a>, <a href="369.htm">369</a>, <a href="808.htm">808</a>); and that similar things are signified by the apostles (<a href="79.htm">79</a>, <a href="790.htm">790</a>, <a href="903.htm">903</a>). From these considerations it is plain what is signified by these words of the Lord:<p>Jesus said unto the disciples, You who have followed Me, when the Son of Man sits upon the throne of His glory, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <a href="3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>.<p>By 'twelve' are signified all, and they are predicated of the goods and truths of heaven and the Church (<a href="348.htm">348</a>); likewise 'twenty-four.' The 'twelve apostles' and the 'twenty-four elders' therefore signify all things of the Church, and the 'twelve' as well as the 'twenty-four thrones' signify everything of judgment. Who is unable to understand that the apostles and elders are not going to judge, and that they cannot do so? From these considerations it can now be established why 'thrones' and 'elders' are mentioned where [the Word treats of] judgment, as also in Isaiah:<p>Jehovah will come to judgment with the elders of the people. <a href="3927/isaiah_3_14.htm">Isaiah 3:14</a>.<p>In David:<p>Jerusalem has been built, and thither the tribes go up, and thrones are set there for judgment. <a href="3927/psalms_122_3.htm">Psalms 122:3-5</a>.<p>And in the Apocalypse:<p>I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them. <a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 233</h4><p>233. Verse 4. (<a href="3927/revelation_4_4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>) And round about the throne were four-and-twenty thrones, and upon the thrones I saw four-and-twenty elders sitting, signifies the arrangement of all things in heaven preparatory to the Last Judgment. He who does not know the spiritual sense of the Word, and at the same time the genuine truths of the church, may believe, that when the Last Judgment shall come, the Lord will sit upon a throne, and that there will be other judges also upon thrones around Him. But he who knows the spiritual sense of the Word, and at the same time the genuine truths of the church, knows that the Lord will not then sit upon a throne, and that neither will there be other judges about Him; and further, that neither will the Lord judge anyone to hell, but that the Word will judge everyone, the Lord moderating that all things may be done according to justice. The Lord says, indeed:<p>The Father judgeth no one, but hath committed all judgment to the Son, and hath given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of man, (<a href="3927/john_5_22.htm">John 5:22</a>, <a href="3927/john_5_27.htm">27</a>).<p>But in another place he says:<p>I came not to judge the world, but to save the world; the Word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day, (<a href="3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>).<p>These two passages agree, when it is known that "the Son of man" is the Lord as to the Word (see above, <a href="44.htm">44</a>[1-2]); therefore the Word will judge, the Lord moderating.</p><p>[2] That by the twelve tribes of Israel and their elders are signified all who are of the Lord's church in the heavens and on earth, and, abstractly, all the truths and goods therein, may be seen, (<a href="251.htm">251</a>, <a href="349.htm">349</a>, <a href="369.htm">369</a>, <a href="808.htm">808</a>); and the same by the apostles, (<a href="79.htm">79</a>, <a href="790.htm">790</a>, <a href="903.htm">903</a>); hence it is plain what is signified by these words of the Lord:<p>Jesus said unto the disciples, Ye which have followed Me, when the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel, (<a href="3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>; <a href="3927/luke_22_30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>).<p>"Twelve" signifies all, and is predicated of the truths and goods of heaven and the church, (<a href="348.htm">348</a>); the same is signified by "twenty-four;" therefore "the twelve apostles" and the "twenty-four elders" signify all things of the church; and "twelve," as also "twenty-four thrones," signify the all of judgment. Who cannot understand, that the apostles and elders will not judge; and that they cannot? From these considerations it may appear why "thrones" and "elders" are mentioned when the Judgment is treated of; as also in Isaiah:<p>Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of His people, (<a href="3927/isaiah_3_14.htm">Isaiah 3:14</a>).<p>In David:<p>Jerusalem is builded, whither the tribes go up; and there are set thrones for judgment, (<a href="3927/psalms_122_3.htm">Psalms 122:3</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_122_5.htm">5</a>).<p>And in Revelation:<p>And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them, (<a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 233 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>233. (Vers. 4.) "Et circum Thronum throni viginti et quatuor, et super' thronis vidi viginti et quatuor Seniores sedentes" significat ordinationem omnium in Caelo ad Ultimum judicium. - Qui non scit Sensum spiritualem Verbi, et simul genuina vera Ecclesiae, credere potest, quod cum Ultimum Judicium venturum est, Dominus sessurus sit super Throno, et quod circum Ipsum alii judices etiam super thronis; sed qui scit Sensum spiritualem Verbi, et simul genuina vera Ecclesiae, is novit quod Dominus tunc non sessurus sit super Throno, nec alii judices circum Ipsum; imo quod nec Dominus judicaturus sit aliquem ad Infernum, sed quod facturus quod Verbum unumquemvis judicet, Domino moderante ut omnia secundum justitiam fiant. Dominus quidem dicit, <p>"Non Pater judicat quemquam, sed judicium omne dedit Filio; potestatem dedit Judicium facere, quia Filius Hominis est," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_5_22" target=_top>Johannes 5:22</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_5_27" target=_top>27</a>);<p>sed alibi dicit, <p>"Non veni ut judicem mundum, sed ut salvem mundum: Verbum, quod locutus sum, illud judicabit illum extremo die," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_47-48" target=_top>Johannes 12:47-48</a>);<p>haec duo concordant, dum scitur quod "Filius Hominis" sit Dominus quoad Verbum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_44" target=_top>44</a>); quare Verbum judicaturum est, Domino moderante. Quod per duodecim Tribus Israelis et eorum Seniores significentur omnes qui ab Ecclesia Domini sunt in Caelis et in Terris, et abstracte omnia vera et bona ibi, videatur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_251" target=_top>251</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_349" target=_top>349</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_369" target=_top>369</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_808" target=_top>808</a>); et quod similia per Apostolos (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_79" target=_top>79</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_790" target=_top>790</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_903" target=_top>903</a>); ex his patet quid significatur per haec Domini verba: <p>"Jesus dixit ad Discipulos, Vos qui secuti estis Me, quum sederit Filius Hominis super Throno gloriae Suae, sedebitis etiam vos super duodecim thronis judicantes duodecim tribus Israelis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_19_28" target=_top>Matthaeus 19:28</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_22_30" target=_top>Luca 22:30</a>) <p>per "duodecim" significantur omnia, et praedicantur de veris et bonis Caeli et Ecclesiae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_348" target=_top>348</a>), similiter "viginti quatuor;" quare "duodecim Apostoli" et "viginti quatuor Seniores" significant omnia Ecclesiae; ac "duodecim" tum "viginti quatuor throni" significant omne judicium; quis non potest intelligere, quod non Apostoli et Seniores judicaturi sint, et quod non possint. Ex his nunc constare potest cur "throni" et "seniores" dicuntur, ubi de Judicio, ut quoque apud Esajam: <p>"Jehovah in judicium veniet cum Senioribus populi Sui," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_3_14" target=_top>3:14</a>);<p>apud Davidem: <p>"Hierosolyma aedificata est, et eo ascendunt Tribus et ibi sedent Throni ad judicium," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_122_3-5" target=_top>Psalm 122:3-5</a>);<p>et in Apocalypsi: <p>"Vidi Thronos, et consederunt super illis, et Judicium datum est illis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_4" target=_top>20:4</a>). </p>
