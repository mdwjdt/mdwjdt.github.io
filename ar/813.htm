<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第813节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>813.“祂的妻子也自己预备好了”表那些将属于该教会，也就是新耶路撒冷的人被聚集起来，被引入并接受教导。“妻子”表示主的新教会，也就是新耶路撒冷。这一点从后面21章中的这些话很明显地看出来：</p><p>我又看见圣城新耶路撒冷由神那里从天而降，预备好了，就如新妇妆饰整齐，等候丈夫。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.2.htm">21:2</a>）</p><p>同一章：</p><p>一位天使来对我说，你到这里来，我要将新妇，就是羔羊的妻，指示你，他就将那由神那里从天而降的圣城耶路撒冷指示我。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启 21.9.htm"> 21:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启 21.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>“妻子也自己预备好了”表示那些将属于主的新教会之人正被聚集起来，被引入并接受教导。由于“她自己预备好了”表示这些事，故经上接着说这妻子“披上明亮洁净的细麻衣”，这句话表示通过教导而引入；因此，后面还有关于“白马”的内容，“白马”表示主为他们提供的对圣言的理解。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 813</h4><p>813. "And His wife has made herself ready." This symbolically means that those who will belong to this church, namely, the New Jerusalem, are being gathered together, introduced to it, and instructed.<p>The wife symbolizes the Lord's New Church, namely, the New Jerusalem, as is clearly apparent from chapter 21 that comes later, where we find the following:<p>I... saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. (<a href="3927/revelation_21_2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>)<p>And in the same chapter:<p>(An angel) came to me..., saying, "Come, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife." And he... showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God... (<a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">Revelation 21:9-10</a>)<p>The wife's making herself ready means, symbolically, that those who will belong to that Lord's New Church are being gathered together, introduced to it, and instructed. And because her making herself ready has the symbolic meaning, therefore it follows next that as a wife she was "arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright," which symbolizes an introduction through instruction. Moreover, for the same reason a white horse is also afterward described, which symbolizes an understanding of the Word provided for them by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 813</h4><p>813. 'And His wife has made herself ready' signifies that those who will belong to this Church, which is the New Jerusalem, are being assembled, inaugurated and instructed. By the 'wife' is signified the Lord's New Church, which is the New Jerusalem. This is plainly evident from a subsequent chapter (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21</a>) where are these words:<p>I saw the holy city, the New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her Husband (verse 2); and in the same chapter:<p>An angel came unto me saying, Come, I will show thee the Bride the Lamb's wife, and he showed me the great city the holy Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God (verses 9-10).<p>By the wife's having made herself ready is signified that those who will be of that New Church of the Lord are being assembled, inaugurated and instructed. And because these things are signified by 'she has made herself ready' it therefore follows that the wife 'was arrayed with fine linen clean and bright,' by which is signified inauguration by means of instruction; and therefore also [something] follows concerning 'a white horse,' by which is signified the understanding of the Word by the Lord for them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 813</h4><p>813. And His Wife hath made herself ready, signifies that they who will be of this church, which is the New Jerusalem, are collected together, inaugurated, and instructed. By "the Wife" the Lord's New Church is signified, which is the New Jerusalem; which is clearly manifest from chap. 21, following, where are these words:<p>I saw the holy city, the New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her Husband, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>).<p>An angel came unto me, saying, Come, I will show thee the Bride, the Lamb's Wife; and he showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">Revelation 21:9-10</a>).<p>By "His Wife hath made herself ready" is signified that they who will be of that New Church of the Lord are collected together, inaugurated, and instructed; and because these things are signified by "she hath made herself ready," it therefore follows that the Wife "was arrayed in fine linen clean and bright;" by which is signified inauguration by instruction; and therefore there also follows the account of "the white horse," by which is signified the understanding of the Word from the Lord for them. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 813 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>813. "Et Uxor Ipsius paravit Se," significat quod illi qui ad Ecclesia hac, quae est Nova Hierosolyma, erunt, colligantur, inaugurentur et instruantur. - Per "Uxorem" significatur Nova Ecclesia Domini, quae est Nova Hierosolyma, quod patet clare a capite seq. (xxi.), ubi haec sunt: <p>"Vidi Urbem sanctam Hierosolymam novam descendentem a Deo e Caelo paratam sicut Sponsam ornatam Marito suo," (vers. 2);<p>et in eodem capite: <p>"Venit Angelus ad me, dicens, Veni, ostendam tibi Sponsam Agni Uxorem; et ostendit mihi Urbem magnam sanctam Hierosolymam descendentem e Caelo a Deo," (vers. 9, 10).<p>Per quod "Uxor paraverit <sup>1</sup>se" significatur quod qui e Nova illa Ecclesia Domini erunt, colligantur, inaugurentur et instruantur; et quia haec per "paravit se" significantur, ideo sequitur quod Uxor illa "amiceretur byssino mundo et splendido," per quod significatur inauguratio per instructionem; et ideo quoque sequitur de "Equo Albo," per quem significatur intellectus Verbi a Domino pro illis.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;paraverit pro "paravit" </p>
