<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第895节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>895.启21:9.“拿着七个金香瓶、盛满末后七灾的七位天使中，有一位来同我说话，说，你来，我要将新妇，就是羔羊的妻，指示你”表来自主出于天堂至内层的流注和显明，是关于新教会的，新教会将通过圣言与主结合。“拿着七个金香瓶、盛满末后七灾的七位天使中，有一位来同我说话”表示主从天堂至内层流入，并通过至内层天堂说话，在此表示显明接下来的事；这位天堂是指主，这一点从15章的解释明显可知，在那里，经上写着：</p><p>这些事以后，我观看，见在天上那存法版帐幕的殿开了，那掌管七灾的七位天使，从殿中出来。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.5.htm">15:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>以此表示天堂的至内层显现，在那里，主在祂的神圣和十诫的律法中（<a href="669.htm">669</a>，<a href="670.htm">670</a>节）；这一点也可从17章的解释明显可知，在那里，经上说：</p><p>拿着七香瓶的七位天使中，有一位来跟我讲话，对我说，来；我大淫妇所要受的审判指示你。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.1.htm">17:1</a>）</p><p>这些话表示来自主出于天堂至内层的流注和启示，是关于天主教的（<a href="718.htm">718</a>，<a href="719.htm">719</a>节）；由此明显可知，“拿着七个金香瓶、盛满末后七灾的七位天使中，有一位来同我说话，说”表示主从天堂的至内层流入，“你来，我要指示你”表示显明，“新妇，就是羔羊的妻”表示新教会，新教会将通过圣言与主结合（<a href="881.htm">881</a>节）。当新教会正在被建立时，它被称为“新妇”；当建立起来时，它就被称为“妻子”；在此之所以被称为“新妇，羔羊的妻”，是因为新教会必定要建立。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 895</h4><p>895. <a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">21:9</a> Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came to me and talked with me, saying, "Come, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife." This symbolizes an influx and revelation from the Lord from the inmost of heaven regarding the New Church, which will be conjoined with the Lord through the Word.<p>One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues and who talked with John means the Lord flowing in from the inmost of heaven and speaking through the inmost of heaven, here revealing the things that follow. That this angel means the Lord is apparent from the exposition of chapter 15, verses <a href="3927/revelation_15_5.htm">5-6</a>, which says:<p>After these things I looked, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle... in heaven was opened. And out... came the seven angels having the seven plagues... (<a href="3927/revelation_15_5.htm">Revelation 15:5-6</a>)<p>This symbolically means that the inmost of heaven appeared, where the Lord is present in His holiness and in the Law contained in the Ten Commandments, as may be seen in nos. <a href="669.htm">669</a>, <a href="670.htm">670</a> above.<p>It is apparent also from the exposition of chapter <a href="3927/revelation_17_1.htm">17:1</a>, which says:<p>Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying..., "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot...." (<a href="3927/revelation_17_1.htm">Revelation 17:1</a>)<p>This symbolizes an influx and a revelation from the Lord from the inmost of heaven about the Roman Catholic religion, as may be seen in nos. <a href="718.htm">718</a>, <a href="719.htm">719</a> above.<p>It is apparent from this that one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues coming to John and talking with him means the Lord flowing in from the inmost of heaven; that coming to him and showing him symbolizes a revelation; and that the bride, the Lamb's wife, symbolizes the New Church, which will be conjoined with the Lord through the Word, as in no. <a href="881.htm">881</a>.<p>This church is called a bride when it is being established, and a wife after it has been established. Here it is called a bride and wife because it is of a surety going to be established. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 895</h4><p>895. [verse 9] 'And there came unto me one of the seven angels having the seven phials full of the seven last plagues, and spoke with me saying, Come, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife' signifies an influx and making manifest from the Lord out of the inmost of heaven concerning the New Church, which will be conjoined to the Lord by means of the Word. By 'one of the seven angels having the seven phials full of the seven last plagues, and he spoke with me' is understood the Lord inflowing out of the inmost of heaven, and speaking through the inmost heaven, here making manifest the things that follow. That by this 'angel' is understood the Lord is plain from the exposition of chapter <a href="3927/revelation_15_5.htm">15:5-6</a>, where are these words:<p>After these things I saw, when behold the temple of the tabernacle was opened in heaven, and the seven angels having the seven plagues went out.<p>That by those words is signified that the inmost of heaven was seen, where the Lord is in His holiness, and in the Law which is the Decalogue, may be seen above (<a href="669.htm">669-670</a>). Then also [it is plain] from the exposition of chapter xvii verse 1, where are these words:<p>And there came one of the angels having the seven phials, and spoke with me saying, Come, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot.<p>That by those words is signified an influx and revelation from the Lord out of the inmost of heaven concerning the Roman Catholic form of religion, may be seen above (<a href="718.htm">718-719</a>). From this it is plain that by 'there came unto me one of the seven angels having the seven phials full of the seven last plagues and spoke with me saying' is understood the Lord inflowing out of the inmost of heaven; and that by 'Come, I will show thee' is signified making manifest; and that by 'the bride, the Lamb's wife' is signified the New Church, which will be conjoined to the Lord by means of the Word (as <a href="881.htm">881</a>). That Church is called 'the bride' when it is being set up, and 'wife' when it has been set up, here 'the bride, the wife' because of the certainty of the setting up. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 895</h4><p>895. Verse 9. And there came unto me one of the seven angels, having the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and spoke with me, saying, Come, I will show thee the Bride, the Lamb's Wife, signifies influx and manifestation from the Lord from the inmost of heaven, concerning the New Church, which will be conjoined with the Lord through the Word. By "one of the seven angels having the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and he spoke with me" is meant the Lord inflowing from the inmost of heaven and speaking through the inmost heaven, here manifesting the things which follow; that by this angel is meant the Lord, appears from the explanation of chapter 15, where it is written:<p>And after that I saw, and behold the temple of the tabernacle in heaven was opened; and the seven angels came out having the seven plagues, (<a href="3927/revelation_15_5.htm">Revelation 15:5-6</a>);<p>by which is signified that the inmost of heaven was seen, where the Lord is in His holiness, and in the Law which is the Decalogue, see above, (<a href="669.htm">669-670</a>); also from the explanation of chapter 17, where it is said:<p>And there came one of the seven angels having the seven vials, and he spoke with me, saying, Come, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot, (<a href="3927/revelation_17_1.htm">Revelation 17:1</a>).<p>That by these words is signified influx and revelation from the Lord from the inmost of heaven concerning the Roman Catholic religious persuasion, may be seen above, (<a href="718.htm">718</a>, <a href="719.htm">719</a>); hence it is evident that by "there came to me one of the seven angels who had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and spoke with me, saying," is meant the Lord inflowing from the inmost of heaven, and that by "Come, I will show thee," is signified manifestation, and that by "the Bride the Lamb's Wife" is signified the New Church, which will be conjoined with the Lord through the Word (as in <a href="881.htm">881</a>). That church is called "the Bride," when it is being established, and "Wife" when it is established; here "the Bride, the Wife," because it is certain to be established. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 895 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>895. (Vers. 9.) "Et venit ad me unus septem Angelorum habentium septem phialas plenas septem plagis ultimis, et locutus est mecum, dicens, Veni, ostendam tibi Sponsam Agni Uxorem," significat influxum et manifestationem a Domino ex intimo Caeli de Nova Ecclesia, quae per Verbum erit conjuncta Domino. -Per "unum septem Angelorum habentium septem phialas plenas septem plagis ultimis, et locutus mecum," intelligitur Dominus ex intimo Caeli influens, et per intimum Caelum loquens, hic manifestans illa quae sequuntur; quod per hunc Angelum intelligatur Dominus, patet ab explicatione capitis <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_895/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_15_1-8" target=_top>15</a>, ubi haec sunt: <p>"Post haec vidi, cum ecce apertum est Templum Tabernaculi in Caelo, et exiverunt septem Angeli habentes septem plagas," (vers. 5 et 6);<p>quod per illa significetur quod visum sit intimum Caeli, ubi Dominus in Sua sanctitate, et in Lege quae Decalogus est, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_895/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_669" target=_top>669</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_895/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_670" target=_top>670</a>); tum etiam ab explicatione capitis <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_895/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_17_1-18" target=_top>17</a>, ubi haec sunt: <p>"Et venit unus ex Angelis habentibus septem phialas, et locutus est mecum dicens, Veni ostendam tibi judicium Meretricis magnae," (vers.1);<p>quod per illa significetur influxus et revelatio a Domino ex intimo Caeli de Religioso Catholico Romano, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_895/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_718" target=_top>718</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_895/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_719" target=_top>719</a>); inde patet, quod per "venit ad me unus septem Angelorum habentium septem phialas plenas septem plagis ultimis, et locutus mecum dicens," intelligatur Dominus ex intimo Caeli influens; et quod per "veni, ostendam tibi" significetur manifestatio; et quod per "Sponsam Agni Uxorem" significetur Nova Ecclesia, quae per Verbum conjuncta erit Domino (ut <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_895/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_881" target=_top>881</a>); Ecclesia illa vocatur "Sponsa" quando instauratur, et "Uxor" quando instaurata est; hic "Sponsa Uxor" quia pro certo instauranda. </p>
