<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>500.“那从无底坑里上来的兽必与他们交战，并且战胜他们，把他们杀了”表那些陷入唯信教义内在的人会反对新教会的这两大基本要素，攻击并弃绝它们，而且只要他们有能力，就会使其他人也弃绝它们。“从无底坑里上来的兽”是指那些从无底坑里上来、看似蝗虫的人（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.1.htm">9:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.12.htm">12</a>）。他们就是那些陷入唯信教义的内在之人，这一点可见于那里所给出的解读；接下来将看到，“交战”表示反对并攻击新教会的这两大基本要素；“战胜他们，把他们杀了”表示在自己里面弃绝并根除它们，并且只要他们有能力，还使其他人也这样做。</p><p>那些以唯信教义的内在为原则的人之所以会置疑并弃绝这两大基本要素，是因为他们已确认与它们截然相反的两个观念：其一，当靠近的不是主，而是父神；其二，遵行十诫的生活并非属灵的生活，仅仅是道德、文明的生活，他们确认这一点，免得有人相信他能靠行为得救，而不是唯独靠他们的信得救。凡在各院校将这些信条深深印在脑海的人以后都不会从中退出。其原因有三，迄今不为人知：第一原因是，就其灵而言，他们已经将自己引入与其灵界中的同类的联系当中，那里有许多撒旦，他们无非以虚假为乐，若不弃绝这些虚假，他们根本无法脱离它们；这一切只能通过直接靠近神救主，并照十诫开始基督徒的生活而成就。</p><p>第二个原因是，他们相信罪得赦免、因而得救是在信的行为中一瞬间被赐给的，后来在状态或过程中又藉着这信的行为而凭圣灵继续、维持并保持存在，完全撇弃了仁爱的操练；一旦吸收了这些教义，以后就会在神面前轻视罪恶，进而活在自己的污秽中。而且，由于他们知道如何在没有学问的人面前通过歪曲圣言，在有学问的人面前通过诡辩来巧妙证实这类事，所以此处经上说“从无底坑里上来的兽战胜并杀了这两个见证人”。然而，这种事只发生在那些喜欢随从自己的意愿，纵情于自己的欲望之人身上。这些人在思想得救时，内心钟爱这些欲望，张开双手拥抱他们的信仰，以为自己凭着以信心的口吻所说出的一些话就能得救，无须为了神，仅仅为了世界来处理自己生活上的事便可。</p><p>第三个原因是，他们年轻的时候就已经吸收了被称为“称义奥秘”的唯信的内在，后来因成长为受人尊敬的牧师，就不思想神与天堂，只思想自己和这个世界，为了自己的名声只保留了其信仰的奥秘，以便他们被尊为智者，并凭其智慧而被认为配得财富的奖赏。这一切都是这信的后果，原因在于，这信里面丝毫没有宗教信仰。事实的确如此，这一点可见于前面第三则记事（<a href="484.htm">484</a>节）。</p><p>在圣言中，“战争（或作战、争战、交战、打仗）”表示属灵的战争，也就是与真理的争战，是通过源于虚假的推理来发动的。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>鬼魔的灵出去，在神全能者的大日聚集他们作战。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.14.htm">16:14</a>）</p><p>龙向妇人发怒，去和她其余的种作战，这种就是那遵守神诫命，为耶稣基督作见证的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.17.htm">12:17</a>）</p><p>那龙之兽得了允许与圣徒争战。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.7.htm">13:7</a>）</p><p>向锡安的女子发起圣战，我们可以趁午时上去。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.4.htm">6:4</a>）</p><p>你们没有上去堵挡破口，在耶和华的日子，在战争中可以站立得住。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.5.htm">13:5</a>）</p><p>在撒冷有神的帐幕，在锡安有居所，祂在那里折断弓上的火箭和争战。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗76.2.htm">76:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗76.3.htm">3</a>）</p><p>耶和华必像勇士出去，必像战士激动热心。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.13.htm">42:13</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗24.8.htm">24:8</a>）</p><p>到那日，耶和华作了在位上行审判者公平之灵，并城门口打退战争的力量。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.5.htm">28:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>求你拯救我脱离凶恶的人，保护我脱离强暴的人；他们终日聚集要争战；他们使舌头尖利如蛇。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗140.1.htm">140:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗140.3.htm">3</a>）</p><p>将来有好些人冒我的名来，说，我是基督，并且要迷惑许多人，你们也要听见打仗和打仗的风声，总不要惊慌。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.5.htm">24:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.7.htm">7</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.6.htm">13:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.8.htm">8</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.8.htm">21:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>在但以理书（10，11，12章），北方王和南方王的战争，以及其它战争无非表示属灵的战争；此外还有其它地方所提到的战争（如以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.3.htm">2:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.5.htm">5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.4.htm">13:4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.14.htm">21:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.4.htm">31:4</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.25.htm">49:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.26.htm">26</a>；何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.18.htm">2:18</a>；撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚10.5.htm">10:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.3.htm">14:3</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗27.3.htm">27:3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗46.8.htm">46:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗46.9.htm">9</a>）。</p><p>由于在圣言中，“战争”表示属灵的战争，所以利未人的办事（ministry）被称为“任职或服役”（military service），这一点从以下经文明显看出来，即经上要求：</p><p>凡前来任职在会幕里办事的利未人，全都数点。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.23.htm">4:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.35.htm">35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.39.htm">39</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.43.htm">43</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.47.htm">47</a>）</p><p>利未人的职责（office）是这样：任职在会幕里办事；到了五十岁要停工退任，不再办事（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.24.htm">8:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.25.htm">25</a>）。也可参看<a href="447.htm">447</a>节，那里通过圣言证明“军队”表示教会的良善与真理，在反面意义上则表示教会的邪恶与虚假。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 500</h4><p>500. The beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war against them, overcome them, and kill them. This symbolically means that those people who are caught up in the interior tenets of the doctrine regarding faith alone will oppose these two essential elements of the New Church, attack them, and reject them, in themselves and, as far as they are able, in others.<p>The beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit means the people who ascended out of the bottomless pit having the appearance of locusts in <a href="3927/revelation_9_1.htm">Revelation 9:1-12</a>. That they were people caught up in the interior tenets of the doctrine regarding faith alone may be seen in the exposition there. To make war means, symbolically, to oppose and attack these two essential elements of the church, as we shall see next. To overcome them and kill them means, symbolically, to reject them and root them out, in themselves and, as far as they are able, in others.</p><p>[2] People caught up in the interior tenets of the doctrine regarding faith alone will attack and reject these two essential elements because they have established in themselves two ideas contrary to them, first, that it is not the Lord but God the Father to whom they should turn; and secondly, that a life in accordance with the Ten Commandments is not a spiritual life, but simply a moral and civic life, and they maintain this to keep anyone from believing that he is saved by works rather than by their faith alone.<p>All those people who in schools and universities have deeply impressed these dogmas on their minds do not afterward turn away from them. There are three reasons for this, hitherto unknown. First, they have introduced themselves as to their spirit into association with people in the spiritual world like themselves, where there are many satanic spirits who find delight only in falsities, and from these spirits they cannot possibly be set free unless they reject those falsities. Nor can they do that unless they turn to God the Savior directly and begin to live a Christian life in accordance with the Ten Commandments.</p><p>[3] The second reason is their belief that they are granted instant forgiveness for their sins and thus salvation in the act of faith, and afterward in the state or progression of it through the same act continued, preserved and retained by the Holy Spirit, apart from any exercises of charity. After that, then, once people have imbibed these ideas, they regard their sins as of no account in the sight of God, and so continue in their impure lives.<p>Moreover, because they know how to cleverly defend such ideas with falsifications of the Word in the presence of uneducated listeners, and with fallacious arguments in the presence of learned ones, we are told here that the beast from the bottomless pit overcame and killed the two witnesses. But this is the case only with people who love to live self-indulgently and are carried away by the delights of their appetites. Whenever these people think about salvation, they harbor at heart their lusts, and with both hands embrace that faith of theirs, because then they can be saved by uttering certain words in a confident tone and do not have to attend to anything having to do with their life for God's sake, but only for the sake of the world.</p><p>[4] The third reason is that people who in their youth have imbibed the interior tenets of that faith, called the mysteries of justification, when afterward promoted to a respectable ministry, do not think to themselves about God and heaven, but about themselves and the world, retaining the mysteries of their faith only for the sake of their reputation so as to be respected as wise, and because of their wisdom, accounted worthy to be rewarded with riches.<p>Such is the case as a result of that faith because it has nothing of religion in it. The reality of this may be seen in the third narrative account above, in no. <a href="484.htm">484</a>.</p><p>[5] That wars in the Word symbolize spiritual wars, which are attacks on truth and are waged by reasonings based on falsities, is clear from the following passages:<p>...spirits of demons... go out... to gather them for war on the great day of God Almighty. (<a href="3927/revelation_16_14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>)<p>...the dragon was angry with the woman, and it went away to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. (<a href="3927/revelation_12_17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a>)<p>It was granted to (the dragon's beast) to make war with the saints... (<a href="3927/revelation_13_7.htm">Revelation 13:7</a>)<p>Prepare holy war against (the daughter of Zion)..., and let us go up at noon. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_6_4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4</a>)<p>You have not gone up into the breaches... to stand in battle on the day of Jehovah. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_13_5.htm">Ezekiel 13:5</a>)<p>In Salem is (God's) tabernacle, and His dwelling place in Zion, where He broke the flaming arrows, the bow... and... war. (<a href="3927/psalms_76_2.htm">Psalms 76:2-3</a>)<p>Jehovah shall go forth like a mighty man; He shall stir up zeal like a man of war. (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>, cf. <a href="3927/psalms_24_8.htm">Psalms 24:8</a>)<p>In that day Jehovah... will be... for a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, ...to those who turn back the battle at the gate. (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_5.htm">Isaiah 28:5-6</a>)<p>Deliver me... from the evil man; preserve me from the violent man... All day they gather for war. They sharpen their tongues like serpents. (<a href="3927/psalms_140_1.htm">Psalms 140:1-3</a>)<p>...many will come in My name, saying, "I am the Christ," and will lead many astray. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled. (<a href="3927/matthew_24_5.htm">Matthew 24:5-7</a>, cf. <a href="3927/mark_13_6.htm">Mark 13:6-8</a>, <a href="3927/luke_21_8.htm">Luke 21:8-10</a>)<p>The wars of the kings of the north and south and other wars in <a href="3927/daniel_10_1.htm">Daniel 10</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_11_1.htm">11</a>, and <a href="3927/daniel_12_1.htm">12</a> symbolize no other than spiritual wars. And so, too, the wars in other places, as in <a href="3927/isaiah_2_3.htm">Isaiah 2:3-5</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_13_4.htm">13:4</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_21_14.htm">21:14-15</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_31_4.htm">31:4</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_49_25.htm">Jeremiah 49:25-26</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_2_18.htm">Hosea 2:18</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_10_5.htm">Zechariah 10:5</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_3.htm">14:3</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_18_35.htm">Psalm 18:35</a> <sup>1</sup>, <a href="3927/psalms_46_8.htm">46:8-9</a>.</p><p>[6] As wars in the Word symbolize spiritual wars, therefore the ministry of the Levites was called military service, as is apparent from the following, that the command was given for the Levites to be numbered, to "perform military service, to do the work in the tabernacle of meeting" (<a href="3927/numbers_4_23.htm">Numbers 4:23</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_4_35.htm">35</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_4_39.htm">39</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_4_43.htm">43</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_4_47.htm">47</a>).<p>This is the service of the Levites: ...to perform military service in the ministry of the tabernacle of meeting; but at the age of fifty years he must cease the military service, and shall minister no more. (<a href="3927/numbers_8_24.htm">Numbers 8:24-25</a>)<p>See also no. <a href="447.htm">447</a> above, where we established from the Word that armies symbolize the church's goods and truths, and in an opposite sense, its evils and falsities.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The citation in the first edition is in error. Either this or <a href="3927/psalms_27_3.htm">Psalms 27:3</a> was perhaps intended. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 500</h4><p>500. 'The beast coming up out of the deep shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them' signifies that those who are in the internal things of the doctrine concerning faith alone are going to be opposed to and attack these two Essentials of the New Church, and in their own case, and with others as far as they carry weight, they are going to reject them. By 'the beast coming up out of the deep' is understood those who came up out of the deep and were seen as locusts (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_9_1.htm">9:1-12</a>). That these are they who are in the internal things of the doctrine concerning faith alone may be seen in the Exposition there. By 'to make war' is signified to be opposed to, and to attack these two Essentials of the Church, concerning which [something] follows. By 'to overcome them, and kill' is signified to reject and eradicate them in their own case, and with others as far as they carry weight.</p><p>[2] The reason why those who are in the internal things of the doctrine of faith alone are going to attack and reject these two Essentials is because they have confirmed with themselves TWO THINGS IN OPPOSITION TO THEM; the FIRST, that not the Lord but God the Father is to be approached; and the OTHER, that a life in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue is not a spiritual life but only a moral and civil life, and this they confirm so that no one may believe that he is being saved by means of works but by means of their faith alone. All who have had these dogmas deeply impressed on their minds in the colleges and universities do not afterwards recede from them. For this there are three reasons, unknown until now; First, that they have introduced themselves as to the spirit into association with their like in the spiritual world, where the majority are satans who are delighted solely with untruths, from whom they cannot possibly be detached unless they reject those untruths; and this cannot be done unless they approach God the Saviour directly, and begin a Christian life in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue.</p><p>[3] The second reason is that they believe that the remission of sins, and thus salvation, is given in a moment in the act of faith, and afterwards in the state or in the progression by means of the same act continued, preserved and kept in existence by the Holy Spirit, quite apart from the exercises of charity; and they who have once become tainted with those [ideas] thereafter make sins of no account in the presence of God, and so live in their own unclean things. And because they know how to confirm such things cunningly by means of falsifications of the Word with the unlearned, and by sophistical reasonings with the learned, it is said here that 'the beast out of the deep shall overcome and kill the two witnesses.' This, however, only happens with those who love to live by their inclination and are borne along by the delights of their lusts. Those, while thinking of salvation, are cherishing these lusts at heart and embracing their faith with both hands, inasmuch as they can be saved in this manner by utterances of certain words with a tone of confidence, and have no need to attend to anything of their life for the sake of God but only for the sake of the world.</p><p>[4] The third reason is that they who in early manhood had imbibed the internal things of that faith, which are called the mysteries of justification, on being afterwards promoted to an honoured position of ministry do not in themselves think of God and heaven but of self and the world, only retaining the mysteries of their faith for the sake of reputation, so that they may be honoured as wise men, and on account of wisdom be esteemed as worthy of remuneration with wealth. It is because there is nothing of religion in it that this is the effect of that faith. That this is so may be seen [in] the THIRD MEMORABLE OCCURRENCE above (<a href="484.htm">484</a>).</p><p>[5] That by the wars in the Word are signified the spiritual wars that are attacks upon truth and are waged by reasonings derived from untruths is established from these statements:<p>The spirits of demons are going forth to gather them to war in the great day of God Almighty. <a href="3927/revelation_16_14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>.<p>The dragon was enraged against the woman, and went away to wage war with the remnant of her seed who were keeping the commandments of God, and had the testimony of Jesus Christ. <a href="3927/revelation_12_17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a>.<p>It was given to the beast of the dragon to wage war with the saints. <a href="3927/revelation_13_7.htm">Revelation 13:7</a>.<p>Consecrate war against the daughter of Zion, and let us go up at noon. <a href="3927/jeremiah_6_3.htm">Jeremiah 6:3-5</a>.<p>You have not gone up into the breaches to stand in the war in the day of Jehovah. <a href="3927/ezekiel_13_5.htm">Ezekiel 13:5</a>.<p>In Salem is God's habitation, and the dwelling in Zion, where He broke the fiery darts of the bow, and the war. <a href="3927/psalms_76_2.htm">Psalms 76:2-3</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_76_3.htm">3-4</a>].<p>Jehovah shall go forth as a mighty man, He shall stir up zeal as a man of wars. <a href="3927/isaiah_42_13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_24_8.htm">Psalms 24:8</a>.<p>In that day shall Jehovah be for a spirit of judgment, to him sitting in judgment, [and for strength to those] who drive war back from the gate, <a href="3927/isaiah_28_1.htm">Isaiah 28</a>:[<a href="3927/isaiah_28_5.htm">5</a>,] <a href="3927/isaiah_28_6.htm">6</a>.<p>Deliver me from the evil man, and preserve me from the man of violences, all day they are gathering together for war, like serpents they are sharpening their tongue. <a href="3927/psalms_140_1.htm">Psalms 140:1-3</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_140_2.htm">2-4</a>].<p>Many shall come in My Name, saying, I am the Christ, and shall mislead many, and you are going to hear wars and rumours of wars, see that you be not troubled. <a href="3927/matthew_24_5.htm">Matthew 24:5-7</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_6.htm">Mark 13:6-8</a>; <a href="3927/luke_21_9.htm">Luke 21:9-11</a>.<p>The 'wars of the kings of the north and of the south, and the rest' in Daniel (chapters <a href="3927/daniel_10_1.htm">Daniel 10</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_11_1.htm">11</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_12_1.htm">12</a>) signify no other than spiritual wars; besides the 'wars' in other places, as <a href="3927/isaiah_2_3.htm">Isaiah 2:3-5</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_13_4.htm">13:4</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_21_14.htm">21:14-15</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_31_4.htm">31:4</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_49_25.htm">Jeremiah 49:25-26</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_2_18.htm">Hosea 2:18</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_10_5.htm">Zechariah 10:5</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_14_3.htm">14:3</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_27_3.htm">Psalms 27:3</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_46_8.htm">46:8-9</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_46_9.htm">9-10</a>].</p><p>[6] Since by wars in the Word spiritual wars are signified, therefore the ministry of the Levites was called 'military service,' as is plain from these statements:<p>It was commanded that the Levites should be numbered, to perform military service, to do work in the tent of the congregation. <a href="3927/numbers_4_23.htm">Numbers 4:23</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_4_35.htm">35</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_4_39.htm">39</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_4_43.htm">43</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_4_47.htm">47</a>.<p>This is the office of the Levites, to perform military service in the ministry of the tent of the congregation; but from a son of fifty years he shall withdraw from the military service of the ministry, nor shall he minister any more. <a href="3927/numbers_8_24.htm">Numbers 8:24-25</a>.<p>Also <a href="447.htm">447</a> above may be seen, where it is confirmed out of the Word that armies signify the goods and truths of the Church, and in the opposite sense the evils and untruths thereof. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 500</h4><p>500. The beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and shall overcome them, and kill them, signifies that they who are in the internals of the doctrine of faith alone will oppose them, and assault these two essentials of the New Church, and will reject them, and, as far as lies in their power, will cause others to reject them. By "the beast that cometh up out of the abyss," are meant they who came up out of the abyss, and appeared like locusts (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_9_1.htm">9:1-12</a>). That these are they who are in the internals of the doctrine of faith alone, may be seen in the explanation there given; by "making war" is signified to oppose and assault these two essentials of the church, as will be seen presently; by "overcoming and killing" them is signified to reject and extirpate them in themselves, and, as far as lies in their power, to cause others to do the same.</p><p>[2] The reason why they who are principled in the internals of the doctrine of faith alone will impugn and reject these two essentials, is, because they have confirmed themselves in two things diametrically opposite to them, First, that it is not the Lord, but God the Father, who is to be approached; and Secondly, that a life according to the precepts of the Decalogue is not a spiritual life, but only a moral and civil life, and this they confirm, lest anyone believe that he can be saved by works, but only by their faith. All they who have had these dogmas impressed deeply on their minds in schools and academies, do not recede from them afterwards. There are three reasons for this which hitherto have not been known: First, because they have entered, as to their spirit, into association with their like in the spiritual world, where there are many satans, who are delighted with nothing but falsities, from which they cannot at all be separated but by rejecting those falsities; nor can this be done but by immediately approaching God the Savior, and beginning a Christian life according to the precepts of the Decalogue.</p><p>[3] The second reason is because they believe that remission of sins, and thus salvation, is given in a moment in the act of faith, and afterwards in the state or in the progression by the same act continued, preserved, and retained, from the Holy Spirit, separate from the exercises of charity; and they who have once imbibed these doctrines afterwards make no account of sins before God, and so live in their uncleanness. And because they know how to confirm such things subtly before the unlearned by falsifications of the Word, and before the learned by sophistry, it is here said that "the beast which came up from the abyss overcame and killed the two witnesses." But this takes place only with those who love to follow their own inclinations, being borne along by the delights of their lusts. When these think about salvation, they cherish those lusts in their hearts and embrace their faith with both hands, thinking that they may be saved by uttering certain words with a tone of confidence, and that they need not attend to anything of their life for the sake of God, but only for the sake of the world.</p><p>[4] The Third reason is that they who, in youth, had imbibed the internals of that faith which are called the mysteries of justification, on being afterwards promoted to an honored ministry, do not think in themselves concerning God and heaven, but concerning themselves and the world, retaining only the mysteries of their faith for the sake of reputation, that they may be honored as wise, and by reason of their wisdom, be thought worthy of being rewarded with wealth. The reason why this is an effect of that faith is because there is nothing of religion in it. That this is so may be seen in the third relation above, (<a href="484.htm">484</a>).</p><p>[5] That by "wars" in the Word, are signified spiritual wars, which are fightings against truth, and are effected by reasonings from falsities, is evident from these passages:<p>Spirits of demons go forth to gather them to war in the great day of God Almighty, (<a href="3927/revelation_16_14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>).<p>The dragon was angry against the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ, (<a href="3927/revelation_12_17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a>).<p>It was given to the beast of the dragon to make war with the saints, (<a href="3927/revelation_13_7.htm">Revelation 13:7</a>).<p>Consecrate war against the daughter of Zion, and let us go up at noon, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_6_4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4</a>).<p>Ye have not gone up into the breaches to stand in war in the day of Jehovah, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_13_5.htm">Ezekiel 13:5</a>).<p>In Salem is the habitation of God and a dwelling in Zion, where He broke the fiery darts of the bow, and the battle, (<a href="3927/psalms_76_2.htm">Psalms 76:2-3</a>).<p>Jehovah shall go forth as a mighty man, He shall stir up zeal like a man of war, (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_24_8.htm">Psalms 24:8</a>).<p>In that day Jehovah shall be for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, who repels war from the gate, (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_5.htm">Isaiah 28:5-6</a>).<p>Deliver me from the evil man, and preserve me from the man of violence; all the day they gather together for war; they have sharpened their tongue like serpents, (<a href="3927/psalms_140_1.htm">Psalms 140:1-3</a>).<p>Many shall come in My name, saying, I am Christ, and shall mislead many, and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, see that ye be not troubled, (<a href="3927/matthew_24_5.htm">Matthew 24:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_6.htm">Mark 13:6-7</a>; <a href="3927/luke_21_8.htm">Luke 21:8-9</a>).<p>The wars of the kings of the north, and of the south, and others, in Daniel, (<a href="3927/daniel_10_11.htm">10:11</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_10_12.htm">12</a>) signify no other than spiritual wars; besides "the wars" mentioned in other places (as in <a href="3927/isaiah_2_3.htm">Isaiah 2:3-5</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_13_4.htm">13:4</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_21_14.htm">21:14-15</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_31_4.htm">31:4</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_49_25.htm">Jeremiah 49:25-26</a>; <a href="3927/hosea_2_18.htm">Hosea 2:18</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_10_5.htm">Zechariah 10:5</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_14_3.htm">14:3</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_27_3.htm">Psalms 27:3</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_46_8.htm">46:8-9</a>).</p><p>[6] Since by "wars" in the Word, are signified spiritual wars, therefore the ministry of the Levites was called "military service," as appears from these things:<p>It was commanded that the Levites should be numbered, to perform military service, to do work in the tent of the congregation, (<a href="3927/numbers_4_23.htm">Numbers 4:23</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_4_35.htm">35</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_4_39.htm">39</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_4_43.htm">43</a>, <a href="3927/numbers_4_47.htm">47</a>).<p>This is the office of the Levites: to perform military service in the ministry of the tent of the congregation; but from a son of fifty years he shall withdraw from the military service of the ministry, nor shall he minister any more, (<a href="3927/numbers_8_24.htm">Numbers 8:24-25</a>).<p>See also above, (<a href="447.htm">447</a>), where it is confirmed from the Word, that "armies" signify the goods and truths of the church, and, in the opposite sense, its evils and falsities. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 500 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>500. "Bestia ascendens ex abysso faciet bellum cum illis, et vincet illos, et occidet illos," significat quod illi qui in internis doctrinae de sola fide sunt, se opposituri sint, et illa duo Essentialia Novae Ecclesiae impugnaturi, et apud se, et quantum valent apud alios, rejecturi. - Per "Bestiam ascendentem ex abysso" intelliguntur qui ex abysso ascenderunt, et visi sunt sicut Locustae, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_500/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_9_1-12" target=_top>9:1-12</a>). Qui quod fuerunt qui in internis doctrinae de sola fide sunt, videatur in Explicatione ibi per "bellum facere" significatur se opponere, et illa duo Essentialia Ecclesiae impugnare, de quo sequitur per "vincere illos et occidere" significatur illa apud se, et quantum valent apud alios, rejicere et exstirpare. <p>Causa quod illi qui in internis doctrinae de sola fide sunt, duo illa Essentialia impugnaturi et rejecturi sint, est quia apud se confirmaverunt duo illis adversantia, Primum, quod non Dominus, sed quod Deus Pater adeundus sit; et Alterum, quod vita secundum praecepta Decalogi non sit vita spiritualis, sed solum vita moralis et civilis, et hoc confirmant, ne aliquis credat quod salvetur per opera, sed per solam illorum fidem. <p>Omnes illi qui haec dogmata alte impresserunt mentibus suis in scholis et gymnasiis, postea non recedunt ab illis. Causae sunt tres, hactenus ignotae: - Prima; quod se in societatem cum similibus in mundo spirituali quoad spiritum suum immiserint, ubi plerique sunt satanae, qui unice falsis delectantur, a quibus nullatenus possunt exsolvi, nisi rejiciant falsa illa; quod nec fieri potest nisi immediate adeant Deum Salvatorem, et inchoent vitam Christianam secundum praecepta Decalogi. Secunda causa est, quod credant dari remissionem peccatorum et sic salvationem momento in Actu Fidei, et postea in Statu seu in Progressione per eundem Actum a Spiritu Sancto continuatum, conservatum et retentum separatim a charitatis exercitiis; ac qui semel illa imbuerunt, illi postea nihili faciunt peccata coram Deo, et sic in suis immundis vivunt: et quia talia sciunt argute confirmare per falsificationes Verbi apud ineruditos, et per sophistica apud eruditos, dicitur hic quod "Bestia ex abysso binos illos testes vicerit et occiderit;" sed hoc non fit apud alios, quam apud illos qui amant vivere genio, et feruntur a jucundis concupiscentiarum suarum; hi cum cogitant de salute, corde illis favent, et ambabus manibus amplectuntur fidem illorum, quia sic possunt per aliquas voces cum sono fiduciae enuntiatas salvari, et non opus habere ut attendant ad aliquod vitae suae propter Deum, sed modo propter mundum. Tertia causa est, quod qui fidei istius interna, quae vocantur arcana justificationis, in adolescentia hauserant, postea Ministerio honorato admoti, apud se non cogitent de Deo et Caelo, sed de se et mundo, solum retinendo arcana suae fidei propter famam ut sicut sapientes honorentur, et propter sapientiam digni aestimentur remunerari opibus. Quod hoc sit effectus illius fidei, est quia nihil religionis in illa est; quod ita sit, videatur Tertium Memorabile supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_500/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_484" target=_top>484</a>).
