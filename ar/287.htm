<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第287节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>287.“他们的数目有万万千千”表处于真理和处于良善的所有人。在属世之义上，“数目”表示与度量或重量有关的；但在属灵之义上，“数目”则表示与品质有关的。在此，天使的品质被描述为“万万千千”，因为“万”被论及真理，“千”论及良善。之所以“万”论及真理，“千”论及良善，是因为万是相对较大的数，而千是相对较小的数；真理多种多样，良善则相对简单；还因为在圣言，鉴于真理和良善的婚姻存在于每个细节中，凡论述真理之处，也必论述良善，否则经上只说有“万万”就足以了。由于这两个数字具有这种含义，所以它们也在其它地方被提及，如以下经文：</p><p>神的车辇万万，平安的天使千千，主在其中，西乃山在圣所中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.17.htm">68:17</a>）</p><p>我观看，当亘古常在者坐上去时，事奉祂的有千千，侍立在祂面前的有万万。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.9.htm">7:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>摩西论约瑟说：</p><p>他的角是野牛的角；用以骶触万民，直到地极；它们是以法莲的万万，玛拿西的千千。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.17.htm">33:17</a>）</p><p>你必不怕黑夜流行的瘟疫，或或是午间灭人的死亡，虽有千人仆倒在你旁边，万人仆倒在你右边。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗91.5.htm">91:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗91.7.htm">7</a>）</p><p>我们街上的羊群成千上万。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗144.13.htm">144:13</a>）</p><p>耶和华岂喜悦千千的公羊，或是万万的油河吗？（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥6.7.htm">6:7</a>）</p><p>当约柜停住时，摩西说：</p><p>耶和华啊，求你归来，回到以色列的千万人中。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.36.htm">10:36</a>）</p><p>在上述经文中，“万”论及真理，“千”论及良善。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 287</h4><p>287. And the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands. This symbolizes all possessing truths and goods.<p>The meaning of a number in its natural sense has relation to measure or weight, while the meaning of a number in its spiritual sense has relation to character; and here the people's character is described by there being ten thousand times ten thousand of them and thousands of thousands; for ten thousand is predicated of truths, while a thousand is predicated of goods.<p>Ten thousand is predicated of truths and a thousand of goods because ten thousand is the greater number, and a thousand the lesser, and truths are complex, while goods are not; also because where the subject in the Word is truths, it deals as well with goods, owing to the marriage of truth and goodness in every part of the Word. Without that marriage the text could have said only ten thousand times ten thousand.<p>Because these two numbers have these symbolic meanings, they are specified therefore also elsewhere, as in the following places:<p>The chariots of God are twice ten thousand, even thousands of angels of peace, the Lord among them, in Sinai, in the Holy Place. (<a href="3927/psalms_68_17.htm">Psalms 68:17</a>)<p>I watched when... the Ancient of Days was seated... Thousands of thousands ministered to Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. (<a href="3927/daniel_7_9.htm">Daniel 7:9-10</a>)<p>(Moses said of Joseph,) ...his horns are the horns of a unicorn; with them He will smite the peoples to the ends of the earth, and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and... the thousands of Manasseh. (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>)<p>You shall not be afraid (for yourself)...of the pestilence that creeps in the darkness, or of the death that lays waste at noonday. A thousand will fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand... (<a href="3927/psalms_91_5.htm">Psalms 91:5-7</a>)<p>...our sheep thousands, ten thousands in our streets. (<a href="3927/psalms_144_13.htm">Psalms 144:13</a>)<p>Is Jehovah pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil? (<a href="3927/micah_6_7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>)<p>When (the Ark) rested, (Moses) said: "Return, O Jehovah, to the ten thousand thousands of Israel." (<a href="3927/numbers_10_36.htm">Numbers 10:36</a>)<p>In all of these places ten thousands refer to truths, and thousands to goods. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 287</h4><p>287. 'And the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands' signifies all in truths and in goods. By 'number' in the natural sense is understood that which relates to measure or weight, but by 'number' in the spiritual sense is understood that which relates to quality; and here their quality is described by [the statement] that there were 'myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands,' for 'a myriad' is predicated of truths, and 'a thousand' of goods. 'Myriad' is predicated of truths and 'thousand' of goods, because a myriad is the greater and a thousand is the lesser, and truths are manifold but goods are simple; also because in the Word where it treats of truths it also treats of goods, on account of the marriage of truth and good in the details of the Word. In the absence of this, 'myriads of myriads' only would have been said. Because those two numbers signify such things they are therefore also mentioned elsewhere, as in these places:<p>The chariots of God are two myriads, thousands of angels of peace, the Lord in them, Sinai in the sanctuary. <a href="3927/psalms_68_17.htm">Psalms 68:17</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_68_18.htm">18</a>].<p>I saw when the Ancient of days did sit, thousands of thousands were ministering unto Him, and myriads of myriads were standing before Him. <a href="3927/daniel_7_9.htm">Daniel 7:9-10</a>.<p>Moses [said] of Joseph:<p>His horns the horns of a unicorn, with them he shall carry the peoples together to the borders of the land, and they the myriads of Ephraim and the thousands of Manasseh. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>.<p>Thou shalt not be afraid for thyself on account of the pestilence that creeps in thick darkness, nor of the death that wastes at midday, a thousand shall fall at thy side, and a myriad at thy right hand. <a href="3927/psalms_91_5.htm">Psalms 91:5-7</a>.<p>Our flocks thousands, myriads in our streets. <a href="3927/psalms_144_13.htm">Psalms 144:13</a>.<p>Is Jehovah delighted with thousands of rams, with myriads of rivers of oil? <a href="3927/micah_6_7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>.<p>When the ark was resting, Moses said:<p>Return, O Jehovah, the myriads of the thousands of Israel. <a href="3927/numbers_10_36.htm">Numbers 10:36</a>.<p>In all these places the 'myriads' are said of truths, and the 'thousands' of goods. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 287</h4><p>287. And the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands, signifies all in truths and in goods. By "number," in the natural sense, is meant that which has relation to measure or weight, but by "number," in the spiritual sense, that which has relation to quality; and here their quality is described by their being "myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands," for "a myriad" is predicated of truths, and "a thousand" of goods. The reason why "a myriad" is predicated of truths, and "a thousand" of goods, is because a myriad is the greater number, and a thousand a less, and truths are manifold, but goods are simple; also because where truths are treated of in the Word, goods are treated of also, on account of the marriage of good and truth existing in every particular, otherwise it would have been sufficient to have said "myriads of myriads." Since these two numbers have such a signification, they are mentioned also in other places, as in the following:<p>The chariots of God are two myriads, thousands of angels of peace, the Lord is in them, Sinai in the sanctuary, (<a href="3927/psalms_68_17.htm">Psalms 68:17</a>).<p>I saw, when the Ancient of Days did sit, a thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and myriads of myriads stood before Him, (<a href="3927/daniel_7_9.htm">Daniel 7:9-10</a>).<p>Moses said of Joseph:<p>His horns are the horns of a unicorn; with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth; and they are the myriads of Ephraim, and the thousands of Manasseh, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>).<p>Thou shalt not be afraid for the pestilence that creepeth in thick darkness, nor for the death that wasteth at noonday, a thousand shall fall at thy side, and a myriad at thy right hand, (<a href="3927/psalms_91_5.htm">Psalms 91:5-7</a>).<p>Our flocks are thousands, myriads in our streets, (<a href="3927/psalms_144_13.htm">Psalms 144:13</a>).<p>Is Jehovah delighted with thousands of rams, or with myriads of rivers of oil? (<a href="3927/micah_6_7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>).<p>When the ark rested, Moses said:<p>Return, Jehovah, unto the myriads of the thousands of Israel, (<a href="3927/numbers_10_36.htm">Numbers 10:36</a>).<p>In all these places "myriads" are spoken of truths, and "thousands" of goods. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 287 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>287. "Et erat numerus eorum myriades myriadum, et chiliades chiliadum," significat omnes in veris et in bonis. - Per "numerum" in Sensu naturali intelligitur id quod se refert ad mensuram aut pondus, at per "numerum in spirituali Sensu id quod se refert ad quale; et hic quale eorum describitur per quod essent "myriades myriadum et chiliades chiliadum," "myrias" enim praedicatur de veris, et "chilias" de bonis. Quod "myrias" praedicetur de veris et "chilias" de bonis, est quia myrias est numerus major, et chilias minor, et vera sunt multiplicia, sed bona simplicia, et quia in Verbo ubi agitur de veris etiam agitur de bonis, propter conjugium veri et boni in singulis Verbi; absque eo potuisset solum "myriades myriadum" dici.
