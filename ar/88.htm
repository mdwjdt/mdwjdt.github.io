<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第88节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>88.“得胜的”表凡与邪恶并虚假争战、得以改造的人。写给七个教会的话描述了基督教会内所有能接受新耶路撒冷教义，并照之生活的人，因而所有能通过与邪恶并虚假争战得以改造之人的状态，所以“得胜的”是说给每个人的，如此处是说给以弗所教会的：</p><p>得胜的，我必将神乐园中间的生命树赐给他吃。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.7.htm">2:7</a>）</p><p>对士每拿教会说：得胜的，必不受第二次死的害。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.11.htm">2:11</a>）</p><p>对别迦摩教会说，得胜的，我必将那隐藏的吗哪赐给他。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.17.htm">2:17</a>）</p><p>对推雅推喇教会说，那得胜又遵守我命令到底的，我要赐给他权柄制伏列族。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.26.htm">2:26</a>）</p><p>对撒狄教会说，凡得胜的，必这样穿白衣。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.5.htm">3:5</a>）</p><p>对非拉铁非教会说，得胜的，我要使他在我神殿中作柱子。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.12.htm">3:12</a>）</p><p>对老底嘉教会说，得胜的，我要赐他在我宝座上与我同坐。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.21.htm">3:21</a>）</p><p>在这些经文中，“得胜的”皆表与邪恶并虚假争战、因而得以改造的人。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 88</h4><p>88. "'To him who overcomes.'" This symbolically means, to him who fights against his evils and falsities and is reformed.<p>Now because the letters to the seven churches describe the states of all those people in the Christian church who can accept the doctrine of the New Jerusalem and live according to it, thus who can, through combats against evils and falsities, be reformed, therefore to each it is said, "He who overcomes," as to the church of Ephesus here:<p>To him who overcomes I will give to eat from the tree of life... (<a href="3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>)<p>To the church of the people of Smyrna:<p>He who overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death. (<a href="3927/revelation_2_11.htm">Revelation 2:11</a>)<p>To the church in Pergamum:<p>To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the hidden manna. (<a href="3927/revelation_2_17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>)<p>To the church in Thyatira:<p>He who overcomes, and keeps My works until the end, to him I will give power over the nations. (<a href="3927/revelation_2_26.htm">Revelation 2:26</a>)<p>To the church in Sardis:<p>He who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments... (<a href="3927/revelation_3_5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>)<p>To the church in Philadelphia:<p>He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God... (<a href="3927/revelation_3_12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>)<p>And to the church in Laodicea:<p>To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My throne... (<a href="3927/revelation_3_21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>)<p>"He who overcomes" in these places means, symbolically, one who fights against evils and falsities and so is reformed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 88</h4><p>88. 'To him who overcomes' signifies he who fights against his own evils and untruths, and is reformed. Now because in the things written to the seven Churches there is described the state of all in the Christian Church who are able to receive the doctrine of the New Jerusalem and to live in accordance with it, thus all who are able to be reformed by combats against evils and untruths, therefore 'He who overcomes' is said to each one; as here to the Ephesian Church:<p>To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life. <a href="3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>,.<p>To the Church of the Smyrnaeans:<p>He who overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death. <a href="3927/revelation_2_11.htm">Revelation 2:11</a>.<p>To the Church in Pergamum<p>To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the hidden manna. <a href="3927/revelation_2_17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>.<p>To the Church in Thyatira:<p>He who overcomes and keeps My works even to the end, [to him] will I give power over the nations. <a href="3927/revelation_2_26.htm">Revelation 2:26</a>.<p>To the Church in Sardis:<p>He who overcomes, the same shall be clothed in white garments. <a href="3927/revelation_3_5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>.<p>To the Church in Philadelphia:<p>He who overcomes, him will I make a pillar in the temple of My God. <a href="3927/revelation_3_12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>.<p>And to the Church in Laodicea<p>He who overcomes, to him will I grant to sit with Me in My throne. <a href="3927/revelation_3_21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>.<p>In these places 'He who overcomes' signifies he who fights against evils and untruths and so is reformed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 88</h4><p>88. To him that overcometh, signifies he that fights against his evils and falsities, and is reformed. Now since in what is written to the seven churches is described the state of all in the Christian church who can receive the doctrine of the New Jerusalem, and live according to it, thus who by combats against evils and falsities can be reformed; therefore it is said to each, "He that overcometh" as here:<p>To the church of Ephesus: to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, (<a href="3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>).<p>To the church in Smyrna; he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death, (<a href="3927/revelation_2_11.htm">Revelation 2:11</a>).<p>To the church in Pergamos: to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, (<a href="3927/revelation_2_17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>).<p>To the church in Thyatira: to him that overcometh and keepeth My works unto the end I will give power over the nations, (<a href="3927/revelation_2_26.htm">Revelation 2:26</a>).<p>To the church in Sardis; he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment, (<a href="3927/revelation_3_5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>).<p>To the church in Philadelphia; he that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, (<a href="3927/revelation_3_12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>).<p>And to the church in Laodicea: to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, (<a href="3927/revelation_3_21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>).<p>"He that overcometh" in these places signifies he who fights against evils and falsities, and thus is reformed. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 88 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>88. "Vincenti," significat qui pugnat contra mala et falsa sua, et reformatur. - Nunc quia in scriptis ad septem Ecclesias describitur status omnium in Ecclesia Christiana, qui possunt recipere doctrinam Novae Hierosolymae, ac vivere secundum illam, ita qui possunt per pugnas contra mala et falsa reformari, ideo ad unamquamvis dicitur, "Qui Vincit;" ut hic Ad Ecclesiam Ephesinam: "Vincenti dabo edere de Arbore Vitae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_88/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_2_1-29" target=_top>2</a> Ad Ecclesiam Smyrnaeorum: "Vincens non laedetur a morte secunda," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_88/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_2_11" target=_top>2:11</a>);<p>Ad Ecclesiam in Pergamo: "Vincenti dabo edere de manne abscondito," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_88/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_2_17" target=_top>2:17</a>);<p>Ad Ecclesiam in Thyatiris: "Vincens et custodiens usque ad finem opera Mea, dabo potestatem super gentes," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_88/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_2_26" target=_top>2:26</a>);<p>Ad Ecclesiam in Sardibus: "Qui vicerit, hic induetur vestimentis albis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_88/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_5" target=_top>3:5</a>);<p>Ad Ecclesiam in Philadelphia: "Qui vicerit, illum faciam Columnam in Templo Dei Mei," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_88/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_12" target=_top>3:12</a>);<p>Et ad Ecclesiam in Laodicea: "Qui vicerit, illi dabo ut sedeat Mecum in Throno Meo," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_88/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_21" target=_top>3:21</a>);<p>"qui vicerit," in illis locis, significat qui pugnat contra mala et falsa et sic reformatur. </p>
