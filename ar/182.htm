<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第182节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>182.“将那些自称是犹太人，其实不是，乃是说谎话的人交给你”表声称教会与他们同在，其实他们没有教会的人。“犹太人”在此表示属教会的人，因为教会曾在他们当中建立，故他们的耶路撒冷也表示教会的教义。不过，如前所述（<a href="96.htm">96</a>节），“犹太人”尤表处于爱之良善的人，因而也表教会，因为教会凭爱之良善存在。“其实不是，乃是说谎话的人”表示其实他们没有教会。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 182</h4><p>182. "'Who say they are Jews and are not, but lie.'" This symbolically means, who say they have embraced the church, even though they have not embraced any church.<p>Jews here mean people who belong to the church, because a church had been established with them, and consequently their Jerusalem still means the church as regards doctrine. More specifically, however, Jews mean people who are impelled by the goodness of love (as described in no. <a href="96.htm">96</a> above), thus also the church, for the goodness of love is what produces the church.<p>That they nevertheless have not embraced any church is what is symbolically meant by the words, "And are not, but lie." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 182</h4><p>182. 'Declaring themselves to be Jews, and are not, but do lie' signifies who say that the Church is with them, when yet there is no Church with them. Here by 'Jews' are understood those who belong to the Church, because the Church had been established with them. Therefore also by their 'Jerusalem' the Church as to doctrine is still understood. But by 'Jews' in a special [sense] those are understood who are in the good of love, as above (<a href="96.htm">96</a>), thus also the Church, for the Church exists out of the good of love. That, however, there is no Church with them, is signified by 'and are not, but do lie. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 182</h4><p>182. Who say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie, signifies who say that the church is with them, when yet there is no church with them. By "Jews" here are meant they who are of the church, because the church was instituted among them, therefore also by their Jerusalem is still meant the church as to doctrine: but, especially, by "Jews" are meant they who are in the good of love, as above, (<a href="96.htm">96</a>), thus also the church, for from the good of love the church exists. That still there is no church with them is signified by "and are not, but do lie." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 182 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>182. "Dicentium se (ipsos Judaeos esse, et non sunt, sed mentiuntur," significat qui dicunt quod apud illos Ecclesia sit, cum tamen apud illos nulla Ecclesia est. - Per "Judaeos" hic intelliguntur qui ab Ecclesia sunt, quia Ecclesia apud illos fuerat instituta; quare etiam per eorum Hierosolymam adhuc intelligitur Ecclesia quoad doctrinam: in specie autem per "Judaeos" intelliguntur qui in bono amoris sunt, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_182/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_96" target=_top>96</a>), ita quoque Ecclesia, nam ex bono amoris est Ecclesia: quod tamen apud illos nulla Ecclesia sit, significatur per "et non sunt, sed mentiuntur." </p>
