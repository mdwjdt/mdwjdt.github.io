<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第82节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>82.“但有一件事我要责备你，就是你把起初的仁爱离弃了”表有一件事要反对他们，就是他们没有将生活的良善置于首位，而事实上，无论过去还是现在，每个教会起初都是将生活的良善置于首位。这话之所以说给“以弗所教会”，是因为该教会表示教会中那些首先关注教义真理而非生活的良善，或将教义真理，而非生活的良善置于首位的人（<a href="73.htm">73</a>节）；生活的良善本应放在首位，即首先予以关注；因为人在何种程度上处于生活的良善，就在何种程度上真正处于教义的真理，反过来则不然。原因在于，生活的良善开启心智的内层，内层被开启后，真理就显现在自己的光中，人由此不仅明白，而且热爱。当首先关注教义，或将教义置于首位时，情况就不同了。这时，真理虽被知晓，却不能从内在被看到，也不能出于属灵的情感被热爱（<a href="17.htm">17</a>节）。每个教会起初无不关注生活的良善，或将生活的良善置于首位，将教义的真理置于其次。但随着教会的堕落，它开始将教义的真理置于首位，将生活的良善置于其次，最终在末期唯独关注信，不仅将仁之良善从信分离出去，甚至还忽略将它们。从这些事明显可知，“你把起初的仁爱离弃了”表示他们没有将生活的良善置于首位，而事实上，无论过去还是现在，每个教会起初都是将生活的良善置于首位。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 82</h4><p>82. "'Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first charity.'" (<a href="3927/revelation_2_4.htm">2:4</a>) This symbolically means, but this is against them, that they do not hold goods of life in first place, as they did, however, before, and as people do at the beginning of every church.<p>This statement is addressed to the church of Ephesus, because it means people in the church who regard doctrinal truths primarily or in first place, and not goods of life (no. <a href="73.htm">73</a>), even though goods of life ought to be regarded in first place or primarily. For to the extent that a person is engaged in good endeavors in his life, to the same extent he is in possession of doctrinal truths really, but not the reverse. The reason is that goods of life open the inner recesses of the mind, and when these have been opened, truths appear in their own light, causing them to be not only understood, but also loved. Not so when doctrinal teachings are regarded primarily or in first place. Truths may indeed be known then, but they cannot be seen interiorly or loved with a spiritual affection. However, more light may be shed on this in no. <a href="17.htm">17</a> above.<p>In its beginning, every church regards goods of life in first place, and secondly doctrinal truths. But as a church declines, it begins to regard doctrinal truths in first place, and secondly goods of life. And in the end it at last regards faith only, and it not only divorces goods of charity from faith then, but even gives up practice of them.<p>It can be seen from this now that the statement, "You have left your first charity," means, symbolically, that they do not hold goods of life in first place, as they did, however, before, and as people do at the beginning of every church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 82</h4><p>82. [verse 4] 'But I have against thee that thou hast left thy first charity' signifies that this is against them, that they do not have the goods of life in the first place, which nevertheless was and is the case at the beginning of every Church. This is said to the [Ephesian] Church, because by it are understood those in the Church who primarily or in the first place have the truths of doctrine in view and not the goods of life (<a href="73.htm">73</a>); when yet the goods of life ought to be regarded in the first place, that is, primarily, for in so far as a man is in goods of life, so far is he really in truths of doctrine, but not the reverse. This is because the goods of life open the interiors of the mind, and when these have been opened truths appear in their own light, out of which they are not only understood, but also loved. The case is different when doctrinal matters are in view primarily or in the first place. Then truths can indeed be known, but not seen interiorly nor loved out of a spiritual affection; but this may be seen elucidated above (<a href="17.htm">17</a>). Every Church during its beginning has the goods of life in view in the first place, and in the second the truths of doctrine; but as a Church turns aside, it starts to have these truths of doctrine in view in the first place, and the goods of life in the second; and at length at the end it has faith alone in view. Then it not only separates the goods of charity from faith, but even gives them up. From these considerations it can now be established that by 'Thou hast left thy first charity' is signified that they do not have the goods of life in the first place, which nevertheless was and is the case at the beginning of every Church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 82</h4><p>82. Verse 4. But I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first charity, signifies that this is against them, that they do not hold goods of life in the first place, which, nevertheless, was and is done in the beginning of every church. This is said to this church, because by it are meant those in the church who primarily or in the first place regard the truths of doctrine, and not the goods of life, (<a href="73.htm">73</a>); when yet the goods of life are to be regarded in the first place, that is, primarily; for in proportion as a man is in the goods of life, in the same proportion he is really in the truths of doctrine, but not the reverse. The reason is, that the goods of life open the interiors of the mind, and these being opened, truths appear in their own light, whence they are not only understood, but also loved. It is otherwise when doctrinals are regarded primarily or in the first place. Truths may indeed then be known, but they are not seen interiorly and loved from spiritual affection; but this may be seen illustrated above, (<a href="17.htm">17</a>). Every church in its beginning, regards the goods of life in the first place, and the truths of doctrine in the second; but as the church declines, it begins to regard the truths of doctrine in the first place, and the goods of life in the second; and at length in the end it regards faith alone, and then it not only separates the goods of charity from faith, but also omits them. From these things it may now appear, that by, "Thou hast left thy first charity," is signified that they do not hold the goods of life in the first place, which nevertheless is, and has been done in the beginning of every church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 82 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>82. (Vers. 4.) "Sed habeo adversus te, quod charitatem tuam primam reliqueris," significat quod hoc sit contra illos, quod primo loco non habeant bona vitae, ut tamen factum est et fit in principio omnis Ecclesiae. - Hoc dicitur ad Ecclesiam (Ephesinam), quia per eam intelliguntur illi in Ecclesia, qui primario seu primo loco spectant vera doctrinae, et non bona vitae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_82/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_73" target=_top>73</a>) cum tamen bona vitae primo loco, hoc est primario, spectanda sunt, nam quantum homo in bonis vitae est, tantum realiter in veris doctrinae est, non autem vicissim; causa est, quia bona vitae aperiunt interiora mentis, quibus apertis apparent vera in sua luce, ex qua non solum intelliguntur, sed etiam amantur: aliter cum doctrinalia primario seu primo loco spectantur; tunc quidem sciri possunt vera, sed non interius videri, et ex spirituali affectione amari; sed hoc illustratum videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_82/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_17" target=_top>17</a>). Omnis Ecclesia, dum inchoat, primo loco spectat bona vitae, et secundo vera doctrinae; sed sicut Ecclesia declinat, incipit illa spectare vera doctrinae primo loco, et bona vitae secundo; et tandem in fine spectat solam fidem, et tunc bona charitatis non solum separat a fide, sed etiam omittit. Ex his nunc constare potest, quod per "quod charitatem tuam primam reliqueris," significetur quod primo loco non habeant bona vitae, ut tamen factum est et fit principio omnis Ecclesiae. </p>
