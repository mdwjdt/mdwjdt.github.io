<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第70节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>70.由于那些属于主在天上的教会之人和那些将属于祂在地上的新教会之人唯独承认为天地之神，所以启示录第一章单单论述主；在接下来的这两章，唯独主向众教会说话，唯独祂会赐下永生的福分。唯独主向众教会说话，这一点从这些经文明显看出来：</p><p>你要写信给以弗所教会的天使说；这些事是那右手拿着七星，在七个金灯台中间行走的说的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.1.htm">2:1</a>）</p><p>你要写信给士每拿教会的天使说；这些事是那首先的、末后的说的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.8.htm">2:8</a>）</p><p>你要写信给别迦摩教会的天使说，这些事是那有两刃利剑的说的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.12.htm">2:12</a>）</p><p>你要写信给推雅推喇教会的天使说，这些事是那眼目如火焰、脚像光明铜的神之子说的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.18.htm">2:18</a>）</p><p>你要写信给撒狄教会的天使说，这些事是那有神的七灵和七星的说的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.1.htm">3:1</a>）</p><p>你要写信给非拉铁非教会的天使说，这些事是那神圣、真实、拿着大卫钥匙的说的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.7.htm">3:7</a>）</p><p>你要写信给老底嘉教会的天使说，这些事是那为阿们的、为诚信真实见证的说的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.14.htm">3:14</a>）</p><p>这些经文取自第一章，唯独论述主，那里所有这些事都用来描述主自己。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 70</h4><p>70. Since the Lord alone is acknowledged as God of heaven and earth by people who are members of His New Church in heaven and by people who will be members of it on earth, therefore the Lord alone is the subject of the first chapter of the book of Revelation, and it is He alone who speaks to the churches in these two chapters, and He alone who will bestow the felicities of eternal life.<p>That it is He alone who speaks to the churches is apparent from these passages:<p>To the angel of the church of Ephesus write, "These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands." (<a href="3927/revelation_2_1.htm">Revelation 2:1</a>)<p>To the angel of the church of the people of Smyrna write, "These things says the First and the Last...." (<a href="3927/revelation_2_8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>)<p>To the angel of the church in Pergamum write, "These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword." (<a href="3927/revelation_2_12.htm">Revelation 2:12</a>)<p>To the angel of the church in Thyatira write, "These things says the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet like fine brass." (<a href="3927/revelation_2_18.htm">Revelation 2:18</a>)<p>To the angel of the church in Sardis write, "These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars." (<a href="3927/revelation_3_1.htm">Revelation 3:1</a>)<p>To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write, "These things says He who is holy, He who is true, He who has the key of David...." (<a href="3927/revelation_3_7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>)<p>To the angel of the church in Laodicea write, "These things says the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God." (<a href="3927/revelation_3_14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>)<p>These characterizations are taken from the first chapter, which has as its subject the Lord alone, and they are all means of describing Him there. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 70</h4><p>70. Since the Lord Only is acknowledged as the God of heaven and earth by those who are of His New Church (e Nova Ipsius Ecclesia) in the heavens, and by those who will be of it on earth (in terris), therefore in the First Chapter the Apocalypse treats of the Only Lord, and in these two chapters following it is He Only Who speaks to the Churches, and He Only Who will give the fortunate things of eternal life. That it is He Only Who speaks to the Churches is plain from these passages:<p>To the Angel of the Ephesian Church write, These things says He Who holds the seven stars in His right hand, Who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands. <a href="3927/revelation_2_1.htm">Revelation 2:1</a>.<p>To the Angel of the Church of the Smyrnaeans write, These things says the First and the Last. <a href="3927/revelation_2_8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>.<p>To the Angel of the Church that is in Pergamum write, These things says He Who has the sharp two-edged sword. <a href="3927/revelation_2_12.htm">Revelation 2:12</a>.<p>To the Angel of the Church in Thyatira write, These things says the Son of God, Who has eyes as a flame of fire, and feet like burnished bronze. <a href="3927/revelation_2_18.htm">Revelation 2:18</a>.<p>To the Angel of the Church that is in Sardis write, These things says He Who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. <a href="3927/revelation_3_1.htm">Revelation 3:1</a>.<p>To the Angel of the Church that is in Philadelphia write, These things says the Holy True One Who has the key of David. <a href="3927/revelation_3_7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>.<p>And to the angel of the Church in Laodicea write, These things says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God. <a href="3927/revelation_3_14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>.<p>These are selected from the First Chapter, in which it treats of the Only Lord, and He Himself is described there by all those things. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 70</h4><p>70. Since the Lord alone is acknowledged as the God of heaven and earth by those who are of His New Church in the heavens, and by those who will be of His New Church upon earth; therefore, in the first chapter of Revelation the Lord alone is treated of; and in the two following chapters, it is He alone who speaks to the churches, and He alone who will give the happy things of eternal life. That it is He alone who speaks to the churches is evident from these passages:<p>Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write, These things saith He who holdeth the seven stars in His right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden lampstands, (<a href="3927/revelation_2_1.htm">Revelation 2:1</a>).<p>Unto the angel of the church of Smyrna write, These things saith the First and the Last, (<a href="3927/revelation_2_8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>).<p>To the angel of the church of Pergamos write, These things saith He which hath the sharp two-edged sword, (<a href="3927/revelation_2_12.htm">Revelation 2:12</a>).<p>Unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write, These things saith the Son of God, who hath His eyes like unto a flame of fire, and His feet like fine brass, (<a href="3927/revelation_2_18.htm">Revelation 2:18</a>).<p>Unto the angel of the church in Sardis write, These things saith He that hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars, (<a href="3927/revelation_3_1.htm">Revelation 3:1</a>).<p>To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write, These things saith He that is holy, He that is true, He that hath the key of David, (<a href="3927/revelation_3_7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>).<p>And unto the angel of the church in Laodicea write, These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God, (<a href="3927/revelation_3_14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>).<p>These are taken from the first chapter, in which the Lord alone is treated of, and He Himself is there described by all these things. </p>

Quoniam Dominus Solus pro Deo Caeli et Terrae agnoscitur ab illis qui e Nova Ipsius Ecclesia in Caelis sunt et in Terris erunt, ideo in primo capite Apocalypseos de Solo Domino agitur, et in binis his sequentibus est Solus Qui loquitur ad Ecclesias, et Solus Qui dabit felicia vitae aeternae. Quod Solus sit Qui loquitur ad Ecclesias, patet ex his: <p>"Angelo Ephesinae Ecclesiae scribe: Haec dicit Qui tenet septem Stellas in dextra Sua; Qui ambulat in medio septem Candelabrorum aureorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_70/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_2_1" target=_top>2:1</a>);<p>"Angelo Ecclesiae Smyrnaeorum scribe: Haec dicit Primus et Ultimus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_70/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_2_8" target=_top>2:8</a>);<p>Angelo Ecclesiae quae in Pergamo scribe: Haec dicit Qui habet romphaeam ancipitem acutam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_70/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_2_1" target=_top>2:1</a>);<p>Angelo Ecclesiae in Thyatiris scribe: Haec dicit Filius Dei, Qui habet oculos sicut flammam ignis, et pedes similes chalcolibano," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_70/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_2_18" target=_top>2:18</a>);<p>"Angelo Ecclesiae quae in Sardibus scribe: Haec dicit Qui habet septem Spiritus Dei et septem Stella,s," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_70/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_1" target=_top>3:1</a>);<p>"Angelo Ecclesiae quae in Philadelphia scribe: Haec dicit Sanctus Verus, Qui habet clavem Davidis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_70/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_7" target=_top>3:7</a>);<p>"Et Angelo Ecclesiae in Laodicea scribe: Haec dicit Amen, Testis fidelis et verus, Principium creaturae Dei," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_70/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_14" target=_top>3:14</a>).<p>Haec desumpta sunt ex capite primo, in quo de Solo Domino agitur et Ipse ibi per omnia illa describitur. </p>
