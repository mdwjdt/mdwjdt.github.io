<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第490节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>490.启11:3.“我要使我那两个见证人”表那些发自内心坦白并承认主是天地之神，祂的人性是神性之人，他们凭遵行十诫的生活而与祂结合。“两个见证人”在此之所以表示这些人，是因为这两点是新教会的两大基本要素。第一个基本要素，即主是天地之神，并且祂的人性就是神性的，是一个“见证”，所以他们是发自内心坦白并承认它的“见证人”；这一点从相关章节（<a href="6.htm">6</a>，<a href="846.htm">846</a>节），同样从以下经文可以看出来：</p><p>我和你那些为耶稣作见证的弟兄同是作仆人的；因为预言中的灵意乃是为耶稣作见证。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.10.htm">19:10</a>）</p><p>米迦勒的使者胜过龙，是因羔羊的血和自己所见证的道；龙去与她其余的种争战，就是那守神诫命，为耶稣基督作见证的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启 12.11.htm"> 12:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启 12.17.htm">17</a>）</p><p>那些因为给耶稣作见证，并为神之道被斧头所斩者的灵魂。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.4.htm">20:4</a>）</p><p>他们就是那些承认主的人。这被称为“为耶稣作见证”，因为主通过祂的圣言，因而通过祂自己见证它；祂由此被称为“诚信真实见证的”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.5.htm">1:5</a> ；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.14.htm">3:14</a>）。并且祂说：</p><p>我为自己作见证，我的见证是真的；因为我知道我从哪里来、往哪里去。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.14.htm">8:14</a>）</p><p>还有：</p><p>保惠师，就是真理的圣灵来的时候，祂要为我作见证。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.26.htm">15:26</a>）</p><p>保惠师或真理的圣灵，也就是圣灵，是发出的神性，这神性就是主自己；这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》（<a href="../lord/46.htm">46</a>-54节）。由于主自己是见证人，所以那些如约翰那样通过主见证这一点的人也由“见证人”来表示：</p><p>耶稣说，你们曾差人到约翰那里，他为真理作过见证；但我不接受从人而来的见证。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.33.htm">5:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.34.htm">34</a>）</p><p>约翰来是要作见证，就是为光作见证；他不是那光，乃是要为光作见证。那与神同在且就是神的圣言是真光。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.34.htm">34</a>）</p><p>新教会的第二个基本要素，就是凭遵行十诫的生活而与主的结合，又是一个“见证”；这一点从以下事实明显看出来，即十诫被称为“法版”（the Testimony，即见证），如以下经文：</p><p>必将我所要赐给你的法版放在柜里。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.16.htm">25:16</a>）</p><p>摩西把法版放在柜里。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.20.htm">40:20</a>）</p><p>在法版之上的施恩座。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.13.htm">16:13</a>）</p><p>把各支派的杖存在这法版前。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民17.4.htm">17:4</a>）</p><p>还有其它地方（如出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.22.htm">25:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.7.htm">31:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.15.htm">32:15</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.5.htm">78:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗132.12.htm">132:12</a>）。</p><p>关于凭遵行十诫的生活而与主的结合，有必要在此说明一下。刻有这些诫命的石版有两块，一块为主，一块为人。第一块石版教导：不可拜多神，只可拜一位；第二块石版则教导：不可作恶；因此，当拜一位神并且不作恶时，结合就产生了；因为人在多大程度上停止邪恶，也就是做出悔改的行为，就在多大程度上为神所接受，并通过神行善。那谁是这一位神呢？在三个位格中的三位一体，或三一神不是那一位神；而是三位一体或三一以一个位格在里面的祂是那一位神，这神就是主。无论怎样纠缠于这些观念，你永远也无法清楚明白神是一，除非祂也是一个位格。这是整部圣言所教导的事实，无论旧约的预言圣言，还是新约的使徒圣言；这一点从《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》很明显地看出来。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 490</h4><p>490. "And I will give power to my two witnesses." (<a href="3927/revelation_11_3.htm">11:3</a>) This symbolizes those people who confess and acknowledge from the heart that the Lord is God of heaven and earth, whose humanity is Divine, and who are conjoined with Him by a life in accordance with the Ten Commandments.<p>These are the people meant here by the two witnesses because these two characteristics are the two essential elements of the New Church.<p>Regarding the first essential, that the Lord is God of heaven and earth, whose humanity is Divine - that this is a testimony, and therefore that those people are witnesses who confess and acknowledge this from the heart, may be seen in nos. <a href="6.htm">6</a> and <a href="846.htm">846</a>, and still further from the following:<p>I am your fellow servant... of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus... For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. (<a href="3927/revelation_19_10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>)<p>(Michael's angels) overcame (the dragon) by the blood of the Lamb and by the Word of His testimony... And the dragon... went away to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. (<a href="3927/revelation_12_11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_17.htm">17</a>)<p>...the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God... (<a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>)<p>These are people who have acknowledged the Lord.<p>The testimony is called the testimony of Jesus because the Lord attests to it on the authority of His Word, thus on the authority of Himself. Therefore He is called the faithful and true witness (<a href="3927/revelation_1_5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_3_14.htm">3:14</a>); and He says,<p>...I testify of Myself, (and) My testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going. (<a href="3927/john_8_14.htm">John 8:14</a>)<p>Also,<p>When the Counselor comes..., the spirit of truth..., it will testify of Me. (<a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>)<p>The Counselor, the spirit of truth, which is also the Holy Spirit, is an emanating Divinity, and this is the Lord Himself, as may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord, nos. <a href="../lord/46.htm">46-54</a>.<p>Now because the Lord Himself is the witness, therefore witnesses also mean people who bear the same testimony on behalf of the Lord, as in John:<p>(Jesus said,) "You have sent to John, and he was a witness to the truth. Yet I do not receive testimony from man... (<a href="3927/john_5_33.htm">John 5:33-34</a>)<p>(John) came as testimony, to testify concerning the light... He was not that light, but was sent to testify concerning the light. (The Word that was with God, and was God,) was the true light... (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>ff.; see also <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">1:14</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_34.htm">1:34</a>)</p><p>[2] Regarding the second essential of the New Church, namely conjunction with the Lord by a life in accordance with the Ten Commandments - that this is a testimony is apparent from the fact that the Ten Commandments are called a testimony, as in the following:<p>You shall put into the ark the Testimony which I will give you. (<a href="3927/exodus_25_16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>)<p>...the Testimony...(Moses) put into the ark... (<a href="3927/exodus_40_20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>)<p>...the mercy seat that is upon the Testimony... (<a href="3927/leviticus_16_13.htm">Leviticus 16:13</a>)<p>(Leave the rods of the tribes) before the Testimony... (<a href="3927/numbers_17_4.htm">Numbers 17:4</a>)<p>And so, too, elsewhere, as in <a href="3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_31_7.htm">31:7</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_31_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_32_15.htm">32:15</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_78_5.htm">Psalms 78:5</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_132_12.htm">132:12</a>.</p><p>[3] We will say something here regarding conjunction with the Lord by a life in accordance with the Ten Commandments:<p>There are two tables on which these commandments were written, one for the Lord and one for mankind. The contents of the first table declare that several gods are not to be worshiped, but only one. The contents of the second table declare that evils are not to be done. When one God is worshiped and people do not do evils, conjunction takes place. For in the measure that a person desists from evils, that is, in the measure that he repents, he is in the same measure accepted by God and does good from God.<p>But who, now, is the one God? A trinal or triune God is not one God when the trine or trinity exists in three persons. But a God who has a trine or trinity in one person is one God, and that God is the Lord. Weave your ideas as you may, you still will not extricate from the tangle the existence of one God unless He is also one in person.<p>The fact of this is something the whole Word teaches, both the Old Prophetic Word and the New Apostolic Word, as may be clearly seen from The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 490</h4><p>490. [verse 3] 'And I will give unto my two witnesses' signifies those who confess and acknowledge from the heart that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth and His Human is Divine, and who are conjoined to Him by means of a life in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue. These are they who are understood here by the 'two witnesses' because these two are the two Essentials of the New Church. That the FIRST ESSENTIAL, 'that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth and that His Human is Divine,' is a testimony, and consequently that they are 'witnesses' who confess and acknowledge it in heart, may be seen (<a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="846.htm">846</a>), and seen still further from these passages:<p>I am a fellow-servant of thy brothers having the testimony of Jesus; for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. <a href="3927/revelation_19_10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>.<p>The angels of Michael overcame the dragon by the blood of the Lamb and by the Word of His testimony: and the dragon went away to wage war with the remnant of her seed, who were keeping the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. <a href="3927/revelation_12_11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_17.htm">17</a>.<p>The souls of those beheaded with the axe on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the Word of God. <a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>.<p>These are they who have acknowledged the Lord. This is called 'the testimony of Jesus' because the Lord testifies it out of His Word, thus out of His Very Self, and therefore He Himself is called 'the Faithful and True Witness' (<a href="3927/revelation_1_5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_3_14.htm">3:14</a>); and He says:<p>I testify of Myself, and My testimony is true, because I know whence I have come, and whither I am going. <a href="3927/john_8_14.htm">John 8:14</a>.<p>Again:<p>When the Comforter, the spirit of the truth (veritas), comes, He will testify of Me. <a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>,<p>That 'the Comforter the spirit of the truth' Who is also 'the Holy Spirit' is the proceeding Divine, and that this is the Lord Himself, may be seen in <a href="../lord/46.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD 46-54</a>. Now because the Lord Himself is the Witness, therefore those also are understood by 'witnesses' who testify this from the Lord, as John did:<p>Jesus said, You sent unto John and he was a witness unto the truth (veritas); yet I receive not testimony from men. <a href="3927/john_5_33.htm">John 5:33-34</a>.<p>John came for a testimony, that he might testify concerning the Light; he was not that Light, but [came] that he might testify concerning the Light. The Word that was with God, and was God, was the true Light. <a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>, seq. <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_34.htm">34</a>.</p><p>[2] That the SECOND ESSENTIAL of the New Church, which is 'conjunction with the Lord by means of a life in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue,' is a testimony is plain from the fact that the Decalogue is said to be 'the testimony,' as in these instances:<p>Thou shalt put into the ark the testimony that I shall give thee, <a href="3927/exodus_25_16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>.<p>Moses put the testimony into the ark, <a href="3927/exodus_40_20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>.<p>The mercy-seat that is over the testimony. <a href="3927/leviticus_16_13.htm">Leviticus 16:13</a>.<p>Leave the staffs of the tribes before the testimony. <a href="3927/numbers_17_4.htm">Numbers 17:4</a>; [H.B. 19]; besides elsewhere, as <a href="3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_31_7.htm">31:7</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_31_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_32_15.htm">32:15</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_78_5.htm">Psalms 78:5</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_132_12.htm">132:12</a>.</p><p>[3] Something shall be said here concerning conjunction with the Lord by means of a life in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue. There are two tables upon which those precepts have been written, the one for the Lord, the other for man. The first table has as its content that not many gods are to be worshipped, but the One. The second table has as its content that evils are not to be done. Therefore when the One God is worshipped and a man does not do evils there is conjunction; for in so far as a man desists from evils, that is, is actively repentant, so far he is accepted by God and does good from Him. But Who now is the One God? A Trinal or Triune God is not the one God, so long as this Trine or Tri-unity is in three Persons, but He is Who has the Trine or Tri-unity in One Person. He is the One God, and that God is the Lord. Make your ideas as intricate as you can, but still you will not get clear that God is One unless also He is One Person. That this is the case the whole Word teaches, the Old Prophetical as well as the New Apostolic Word, as can be seen manifestly from THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 490</h4><p>490. Verse 3. And I will give unto My two witnesses, signifies those who confess and acknowledge from the heart that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that His Human is Divine, and who are conjoined to Him by a life according to the precepts of the Decalogue. The reason why these are here meant by "the two witnesses," is, because these two are the two essentials of the New Church. That the first essential, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that His Human is Divine, is "a testimony," and consequently, that they are "witnesses" who confess and acknowledge it in the heart, may be seen, (<a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="846.htm">846</a>), and likewise from the following passages:<p>I am the fellow servant of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus; for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy, (<a href="3927/revelation_19_10.htm">Rev 19:10</a>).<p>The angels of Michael overcame the dragon by the blood of the Lamb and by the Word of His testimony: and the dragon went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who kept the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ, (<a href="3927/revelation_12_11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_12_17.htm">17</a>).<p>The souls of them that were smitten with the axe for the testimony of Jesus and for the Word of God, (<a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">Rev 20:4</a>).<p>These are they who acknowledged the Lord. This is called "the testimony of Jesus," because the Lord testifies it from His Word, thus from Himself; on which account He is called:<p>The Faithful and True Witness, (<a href="3927/revelation_1_5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_3_14.htm">3:14</a>).<p>And He says:<p>I testify of Myself, and My testimony is true; because I know whence I come, and whither I go, (<a href="3927/john_8_14.htm">John 8:14</a>).<p>Also:<p>When the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, is come, He shall testify of Me, (<a href="3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>).<p>That the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, which is also the Holy Spirit, is the proceeding Divine, and that this is the Lord Himself, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord, (<a href="46.htm">46-54</a> Now because the Lord Himself is the Witness, therefore those also are meant by "witnesses" who testify this from the Lord, as John did:<p>Jesus said, Ye sent unto John, and he was a witness to the truth; yet I receive not testimony from man, (<a href="3927/john_5_33.htm">John 5:33-34</a>).<p>John came for a testimony, that he might testify concerning the light: he was not the Light, but that he might testify of the Light. The Word, which was with God, and which was God, was the true Light, (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-14</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_34.htm">34</a>).</p><p>[2] That the second essential of the New Church, which is conjunction with the Lord by a life according to the precepts of the Decalogue, is "a Testimony," is manifest from the fact that the Decalogue is called "the Testimony;" as in these passages:<p>Thou shalt put into the ark the Testimony which I will give thee, (<a href="3927/exodus_25_16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>).<p>Moses put the Testimony into the Ark, (<a href="3927/exodus_40_20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>).<p>The mercy-seat which is over the Testimony, (<a href="3927/leviticus_16_13.htm">Leviticus 16:13</a>).<p>Leave the staffs of the tribes before the Testimony, (<a href="3927/numbers_17_4.htm">Numbers 17:4</a>. Beside, (<a href="3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>) (<a href="3927/exodus_31_7.htm">Exodus 31:7</a>) (<a href="3927/exodus_31_18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>) (<a href="3927/exodus_32_15.htm">Exodus 32:15</a>) s, (<a href="3927/psalms_78_5.htm">Psalms 78:5</a>) (<a href="3927/psalms_132_12.htm">Psalms 132:12</a>) other places, as <a href="3927/exodus_25_22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_31_7.htm">31:7</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_31_18.htm">18</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_32_15.htm">32:15</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_78_5.htm">Psalms 78:5</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_132_12.htm">132:12</a>).</p><p>[3] Something shall here be said concerning conjunction with the Lord by a life according to the precepts of the Decalogue. There are two tables upon which those precepts are written, one for the Lord, the other for man. The first table, teaches that many gods are not to be worshiped, but one; the second table, that evils are not to be done; therefore, when one God is worshiped, and man does not do evils, conjunction takes place; for so far as a man desists from evils, that is, does the work of repentance, so far he is accepted by God, and does good from Him. But who now is the one God? A trine or triune God is not one God when this trine and triune is in three Persons; but He, in whom the trine or triune is in one Person, is one God, and that God is the Lord. Entangle the ideas as far as you can, yet you will never be able to extricate the idea that God is one, unless He is also one Person. That this is so, the whole Word teaches, both in the Old Prophetic, and in the New Apostolic, as may be clearly seen from The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 490 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>490. (Vers. 3.) "Et dabo duobus Testibus Meis" significat illos qui confitentur et agnoscunt ex corde quod Dominus sit Deus Caeli et Terrae, ac Humanum ipsius Dominum, et qui conjunguntur Ipsi per vita in secundum praecepta Decalogi. - Quod illi sint qui per "duos testes" hic intelliguntur, est quia duo illa sunt duo Essentialia Novae Ecclesiae. Quod Primum Essentiale, quod Dominus sit Deus Caeli et Terrae, et quod Humanum Ipsius sit Divinum, sit "testimonium," et inde quod illi sint "testes" qui id confitentur et agnoscunt corde, videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_6" target=_top>6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_846" target=_top>846</a>, et adhuc ex his: <p>"Sum conservus fratrum tuorum habentium Testimonium Jesu; Testimonium enim Jesu est Spiritus prophetiae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_19_10" target=_top>Apocalypsis 19:10</a>);<p>Michaelis Angeli vicerunt Draconem "per Sanguinem Agni et per Verbum Testimonii" Ipsius: "et Draco abivit ut faceret bellum cum reliquis seminis ejus, qui tenebant mandata Dei, et habent Testimonium Jesu Christi," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_11" target=_top>Apocalypsis 12:11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_17" target=_top>17</a>);<p>"Animae securi percussorum propter Testimonium Jesu, et propter Verbum Dei," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_4" target=_top>Apocalypsis 20:4</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>hi sunt, qui agnoverunt Dominum: illud vocatur "Testimonium Jesu," quia Dominus id testatur ex Suo Verbo, ita ex Se Ipso: quare Ipse vocatur "Testis Fidelis et Verus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_1_5" target=_top>Apocalypsis 1:5</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_3_14" target=_top>3:14</a>);<p>et dicit "Ego Testor de Me Ipso, et verum est Testimonium Meum, qua scio unde veni, et quo vado," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_8_14" target=_top>Johannes 8:14</a>);<p>tum, <p>Cum venerit Paracletus Spiritus veritatis, Ille Testabitur de Me," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_26" target=_top>Johannes 15:26</a>);<p>quod Paracletus Spiritus veritatis, Qui etiam est Spiritus Sanctus, sit Divinum procedens, et quod Illud sit Ipse Dominus, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_46" target=_top>Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 46-54</a>. Nunc quia Ipse Dominus est Testis, ideo etiam per "testes" intelliguntur qui a Domino testantur illud, ut Johannes: Jesus dixit, <p>"Vos misistis ad Johannem, et ille Testis fuit veritati: Ego tamen non ab homine accipio Testimonium," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_5_33" target=_top>Johannes 5:33</a>, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_5_34" target=_top>34</a>));<p>Johannes venit in Testimonium, ut Testaretur de Luce; non erat ille Lux, sed ut Testaretur de Luce. Verbum quod fuit apud Deum, et quod Deus, erat Lux vera, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_1-2" target=_top>Johannes 1:1-2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_14" target=_top>14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_34" target=_top>34</a>).<p>Quod Alterum Essentiale Novae Ecclesiae, quod est conjunctio cum Domino per vitam secundum praecepta Decalogi, sit "testimonium," patet ex eo quod Decalogus dicatur "testimonium" ut in his: <p>"Dabis in Arcam Testimonium, quod dabo tibi," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_25_16" target=_top>Exodus 25:16</a>);<p>Moses "dedit Testimonium in Arcam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_40_20" target=_top>Exodus 40:20</a>);<p>"Propitiatorium quod super Testimonio," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_leviticus_16_13" target=_top>Leviticus 16:13</a>);<p>Relinque baculos Tribuum "coram Testimonio," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_17_1-13" target=_top>Numeri 17</a>:19 (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_17_4" target=_top>4</a>)).<p>(Praeter alibi, ut <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_25_22" target=_top>Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_31_7" target=_top>31:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_31_18" target=_top>18</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_32_15" target=_top>32:15</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_78_5" target=_top>Psalm 78:5</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_490/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_132_12" target=_top>Psalm 132:12</a>). <p>Aliquid hic dicetur de conjunctione cum Domino per vitam secundum praecepta Decalogi. Sunt binae Tabulae, quibus inscripta sunt illa praecepta, una pro Domino, altera pro homine. Prima tabula continet quod non plures Dii colendi sint, sed Unus; Altera tabula continet quod non facienda sint Mala: quando itaque Unus Deus colitur, et homo non facit mala, fit conjunctio; nam quantum homo desistit a malis, hoc est, paenitentiam agit, tantum acceptatur a Deo, et facit bonum ab Ipso. Sed quis nunc est Deus Unus; Deus Trinus aut Deus Triunus non est Deus Unus dum est Trinus et Triunus in tribus Personis, sed Ille Cui Trinum aut Triunum in una Persona est; Ille est Deus Unus, et Ille Deus est Dominus. Intrica ideas quousque potes, at usque non extricaberis quod Deus Unus sit, nisi etiam Unus sit Persona:quod ita sit, docet totum Verbum, tam Vetus Propheticum quam Novum Apostolicum, ut manifeste potest videri ex Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;4 pro "14" </p>
