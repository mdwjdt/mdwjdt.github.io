<p>48.“眼目如同火焰”表神性之爱的神性智慧。在圣言中，“眼目”表理解力。因此，眼的视力表聪明；当论及主时，自然就表示神性智慧。“火焰”表属灵之爱，也就是仁；当论及主时，也就表示神性之爱。所以“主的眼目如同火焰”也就表示神性之爱的神性智慧。</p><p>“眼目”之所以表示理解力，是因为这二者有对应关系。理解力通过属灵之光看见，正如眼睛通过属世之光看见，故“看见”论及这二者。在圣言中，“眼”表示理解力，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>你要将有眼而瞎、有耳而聋的民都带出来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.8.htm">43:8</a>）</p><p>到那日，聋子必听见这书上的话；瞎子的眼必从幽暗晦冥中得以看见。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.18.htm">29:18</a>）</p><p>那时瞎子的眼必睁开、聋子的耳必开通。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.5.htm">35:5</a>）</p><p>我使作外邦人的光、开瞎子的眼。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.6.htm">42:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.7.htm">7</a>）</p><p>这话是说主，祂来临时，会开启那些对真理无知之人的理解力。</p><p>这就是“开眼”的意思，这一点从以下经文进一步明显可知：</p><p>要使这百姓心蒙脂油，耳朵发沉，恐怕他们用眼看见。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.9.htm">6:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.10.htm">10</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.40.htm">12:40</a>）</p><p>耶和华将沉睡的灵浇灌你们，封闭你们的眼；蒙盖先知，你们的头，先见。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.10.htm">29:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.10.htm">30:10</a>）</p><p>闭眼不看邪恶的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.15.htm">33:15</a>）</p><p>愚蠢的人啊，你听这话，有眼睛却看不见。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.2.htm">12:2</a>）</p><p>丢弃羊群的牧人有祸了。刀剑必临到他的右眼上，他的右眼也必昏暗失明。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚11.17.htm">11:17</a>）</p><p>耶和华用灾殃攻击那与耶路撒冷争战的所有人民；他们的眼在眶中干瘪。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.12.htm">14:12</a>）</p><p>我必以惊惶击打一切马匹，使万民一切的马匹瞎眼。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.4.htm">12:4</a>）</p><p>“马”在灵义上是指对圣言的理解（<a href="298.htm">298</a>节）。</p><p>“耶和华我的神啊，求你开启我的眼目，免得我沉睡至死。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗13.3.htm">13:3</a>）</p><p>谁都能看出，在这些经文中，“眼目”表示理解力。由此明显可知在以下经文中，主所说的“眼睛”是什么意思：</p><p>眼睛就是身上的灯；你的眼睛若康健，全身就都光明；你的眼睛若昏花，全身就都黑暗。你里头的光若黑暗了，那黑暗是何等大呢！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.22.htm">6:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.23.htm">23</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.34.htm">11:34</a>）</p><p>若是你的右眼叫你跌倒，就把它剜出来丢掉；你只有一只眼进入永生，强如有两只眼被丢在火烧的地狱（希腊文∶欣嫩子谷）。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.29.htm">5:29</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.9.htm">18:9</a>）</p><p>在以上经文中，“眼睛”不是指肉眼，而是指对真理的理解。由于“眼睛”表示对真理的理解，故以色列人的律例中有这样一条：</p><p>亚伦的种中凡瞎眼的，或眼睛有毛病的，都不可近前来献祭；也不可在圣所中。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利21.18.htm">21:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利21.20.htm">20</a>）</p><p>瞎眼的不可献为祭。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利22.22.htm">22:22</a>；玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛1.8.htm">1:8</a>）</p><p>从这些经文明显可知，当论及人时，“眼”是什么意思；由此可推知，当论及主时，“眼”表祂的神性智慧，以及祂的全知和天命。如以下经文：</p><p>耶和华啊，求你睁眼而看。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.17.htm">37:17</a>）</p><p>我必注目善待他们，我也要建立他们。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶24.6.htm">24:6</a>）</p><p>看哪，耶和华定睛在他们身上。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗33.18.htm">33:18</a>）</p><p>耶和华在圣殿里，祂的眼目观看，祂的眼皮察验世人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗11.4.htm">11:4</a>）</p><p>由于“基路伯”表示主的守护和眷顾，免得圣言的灵义受到损害，故经上描述四活物（即基路伯）说：</p><p>它们前后都长满了眼睛，它们的翅膀同样都满了眼睛。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.6.htm">4:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.8.htm">8</a>）</p><p>基路伯所行走的轮子周围都满了眼睛。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结10.12.htm">10:12</a>）</p><p>“火焰”表主的神性之爱，这一点可见于下文论及“火焰”与“火”之处。由于经上说主的“眼目如同火焰”，故所表示的是神性之爱的神性智慧。主里面有神性智慧的神性之爱和神性之爱的神性智慧，因而有一个二者的相互结合。这是一个奥秘，此奥秘在《圣爱与圣智》（<a href="../dlw/34.htm">34</a>-39节等）一书已揭开。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 48</h4><p>48. And His eyes like a flame of fire. This symbolizes the Divine wisdom accompanying Divine love.<p>Eyes in the Word mean the intellect, and the sight of the eyes, therefore, intelligence. Consequently, when said in reference to the Lord, they mean Divine wisdom. A flame of fire, moreover, symbolizes spiritual love, which is charity, and consequently, when said in reference to the Lord, it means Divine love. So now, the statement that His eyes were like a flame of fire symbolizes the Divine wisdom accompanying Divine love.<p>That the eye symbolizes the intellect is because they correspond. For as the eye sees as a result of natural light, so the intellect sees as a result of spiritual light. Consequently seeing is predicated of both.<p>That the eye in the Word symbolizes the intellect is apparent from the following passages:<p>Bring out the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf who have ears. (<a href="3927/isaiah_43_8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a>)<p>In that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and out of darkness... the eyes of the blind shall see. (<a href="3927/isaiah_29_18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>)<p>Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf... (<a href="3927/isaiah_35_5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>)<p>...I will give You... as a light to the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind... (<a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6-7</a>)<p>The last is said of the Lord, who, when He comes, will open the intellect in people who are ignorant of the truth.</p><p>[2] That this is what is meant by opening the eyes is further apparent from the following passages:<p>Make the heart of this people fat..., and smear over their eyes, lest they see with their eyes... (<a href="3927/isaiah_6_10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_40.htm">John 12:40</a>)<p>For Jehovah has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes; the prophets and your leaders, the seers, He has covered. (<a href="3927/isaiah_29_10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>, cf. <a href="3927/isaiah_30_10.htm">30:10</a>)<p>...who shuts his eyes so as not to see evil. (<a href="3927/isaiah_33_15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>)<p>Hear this..., O foolish people..., who have eyes and see not... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_5_21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a>)<p>(The punishment of) the shepherd, who deserts the flock: a sword shall be... against his right eye..., and his right eye shall be totally darkened. (<a href="3927/zechariah_11_17.htm">Zechariah 11:17</a>)<p>...the plague with which Jehovah will strike all the peoples who fought against Jerusalem: ...their eyes shall waste away in their sockets... (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_12.htm">Zechariah 14:12</a>)<p>...I will strike every horse with stupor, and... every horse of the peoples with blindness. (<a href="3927/zechariah_12_4.htm">Zechariah 12:4</a>)<p>A horse in the spiritual sense is an understanding of the Word (no. <a href="298.htm">298</a>).<p>...hear me, Jehovah my God; enlighten my eyes, lest (perchance) I sleep the sleep of death. (<a href="3927/psalms_13_3.htm">Psalms 13:3</a>)<p>Everyone sees that eyes in these places symbolize the intellect.</p><p>[3] It is apparent from this what the Lord meant by the eye in the following places:<p>The lamp of the body is the eye. If... your eye is whole, your entire body will be full of light. If... your eye is bad, your entire body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness! (<a href="3927/matthew_6_22.htm">Matthew 6:22-23</a>, cf. <a href="3927/luke_11_34.htm">Luke 11:34</a>)<p>If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is better for you... to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire. (<a href="3927/matthew_5_29.htm">Matthew 5:29</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_18_9.htm">18:9</a>)<p>The eye in these places does not mean an eye, but an understanding of truth.<p>Since the eye symbolizes an understanding of truth, it was therefore one of the statutes among the children of Israel that a blind man of the posterity of Aaron or one blurry-eyed not approach to offer a sacrifice, nor enter within the veil (<a href="3927/leviticus_21_18.htm">Leviticus 21:18</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_23.htm">23</a>), and that nothing blind be offered as a sacrifice (<a href="3927/leviticus_22_22.htm">Leviticus 22:22</a>, <a href="3927/malachi_1_8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>).</p><p>[4] It is apparent from this what an eye means when said in reference to a person. It follows then that when said in reference to the Lord, it means His Divine wisdom, and also His omniscience and providence, as in the following passages:<p>Open Your eyes, Jehovah, and see. (<a href="3927/isaiah_37_17.htm">Isaiah 37:17</a>)<p>I will set My eye on them for good, and... I will build them... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_24_6.htm">Jeremiah 24:6</a>)<p>Behold, the eye of Jehovah is on those who fear Him... (<a href="3927/psalms_33_18.htm">Psalms 33:18</a>)<p>Jehovah is in His holy temple...; His eyes behold, (and) His eyelids test the children of man. (<a href="3927/psalms_11_4.htm">Psalms 11:4</a>)<p>Inasmuch as cherubim symbolize the Lord's protection and providence to keep the spiritual meaning of the Word from being harmed, therefore it is said of the four living creatures - which were cherubim - that they were full of eyes in front and in back, and that their wings were likewise full of eyes (<a href="3927/revelation_4_6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_4_8.htm">8</a>). And it is also said that the wheels on which the cherubim rode were full of eyes all around (<a href="3927/ezekiel_10_12.htm">Ezekiel 10:12</a>).</p><p>[5] "A flame of fire" means the Lord's Divine love, as will be seen in subsequent expositions where flame and fire are mentioned. And because it is said that His eyes were like a flame of fire, it symbolizes the Divine wisdom accompanying Divine love.<p>The concept that the Lord has in Him Divine love as a property of Divine wisdom, and Divine wisdom as a property of Divine love, thus a reciprocal union of the two, is an arcanum disclosed in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom, nos. <a href="../dlw/34.htm">34-39</a> and elsewhere. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 48</h4><p>48. 'And His eyes as a flame of fire' signifies the Divine Wisdom of the Divine Love. By 'eyes' in the Word the understanding is meant, and by the sight of the eyes, intelligence. When, therefore, [this is said] of the Lord, the Divine Wisdom is understood. By 'a flame of fire,' however, is signified the spiritual love that is charity; therefore the Divine Love is understood when it concerns the Lord. Consequently, then, the Divine Wisdom of the Divine Love is signified by the fact that His eyes were as a flame of fire. That the eye signifies the understanding, is because they correspond; for as the eye sees by virtue of natural light, so the understanding sees by virtue of spiritual light. 'To see' is therefore predicated of both. That by 'eye' in the Word the understanding is signified is plain from the following passages:<p>Bring forth the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf who have ears. <a href="3927/isaiah_43_8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a>.<p>In that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of dense darkness. <a href="3927/isaiah_29_18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>.<p>Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf. <a href="3927/isaiah_35_5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>.<p>I will give Thee for a light of the Gentiles, for the opening of the eyes of the blind. <a href="3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">Isaiah 42:6-7</a>.<p>These things [are said] of the Lord, Who when He comes will open the understanding with those who are in ignorance of the truth.</p><p>[2] That this is understood by 'opening the eyes' is even plainer from these passages:<p>Make the heart of this people fat, and smear over their eyes, lest perchance they see with their eyes. <a href="3927/isaiah_6_9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_40.htm">John 12:40</a>.<p>Jehovah has poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes; the prophets and your leaders, the seers has He covered. <a href="3927/isaiah_29_10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_30_10.htm">30:10</a>.<p>Who shuts his eyes lest he should see evil. <a href="3927/isaiah_33_15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>.<p>Hear this, O foolish people, who have eyes and see not. <a href="3927/ezekiel_12_2.htm">Ezekiel 12:2</a>.<p>The punishment of the shepherd deserting the flock; the sword upon [his] right eye, and [his] right eye shall be darkened with dense darkness, <a href="3927/zechariah_11_17.htm">Zechariah 11:17</a>.<p>The plague wherewith Jehovah will smite all the people that shall fight against Jerusalem; their eyes shall consume away in their sockets, <a href="3927/zechariah_14_12.htm">Zechariah 14:12</a>.<p>I will smite every horse with astonishment, and every horse of the people with blindness, <a href="3927/zechariah_12_4.htm">Zechariah 12:4</a>.<p>A 'horse' in the spiritual sense is the understanding of the Word (<a href="298.htm">298</a>).<p>Give heed to me, Jehovah my God, enlighten my eyes, lest perchance I sleep death. <a href="3927/psalms_13_3.htm">Psalms 13:3</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_13_4.htm">4</a>].<p>Every one sees that in these passages the understanding is signified by 'eyes.</p><p>[3] Consequently it is plain what the Lord understood by 'eye' in these passages:<p>The lamp of the body is the eye; if thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light; if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be darkened. If therefore the light (lumen) that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness. <a href="3927/matthew_6_22.htm">Matthew 6:22-23</a>; <a href="3927/luke_11_34.htm">Luke 11:34</a>.<p>If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee, for it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire. <a href="3927/matthew_5_29.htm">Matthew 5:29</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_18_9.htm">18:9</a>.<p>By 'eye' in these passages is not understood an eye, but an understanding of truth. Since by 'eye' an understanding of truth is signified, there was therefore among the statutes with the sons of Israel, that: out of the seed of Aaron, a blind man, or one with a disordered eye, should not come nigh to offer a sacrifice, nor enter within the veil. <a href="3927/leviticus_21_18.htm">Leviticus 21:18</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_20.htm">20</a>.<p>Again that: anything blind should not be offered in a sacrifice. <a href="3927/leviticus_22_22.htm">Leviticus 22:22</a>; <a href="3927/malachi_1_8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>.</p><p>[4] It is plain from these [passages] what is understood by 'eye' when predicated of man: it follows therefrom that by 'eye' when predicated of the Lord is understood His Divine Wisdom, also His Omniscience and Providence, as in these passages:<p>Open Thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see, <a href="3927/isaiah_37_17.htm">Isaiah 37:17</a>.<p>I will set My eye upon them in good, and I will build them. <a href="3927/jeremiah_24_6.htm">Jeremiah 24:6</a>.<p>Behold the eye of Jehovah is upon them who fear Him. <a href="3927/psalms_33_18.htm">Psalms 33:18</a>.<p>Jehovah in the temple of His holiness, His eyes behold, and His eyelids try the sons of man. <a href="3927/psalms_11_4.htm">Psalms 11:4</a>.<p>Since by 'cherubs' is signified the Lord's guarding and providence that the spiritual sense of the Word should not be injured, therefore it is said of the four animals that were cherubs, that:<p>They were full of eyes before and behind, and their wings were likewise full of eye. <a href="3927/revelation_4_6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_4_8.htm">8</a>.<p>Again that:<p>The wheels, upon which the cherubs were borne along, were full of eyes round about. <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_12.htm">Ezekiel 10:12</a>.</p><p>[5] That by 'a flame of fire' His Divine Love is understood will be seen in the following pages where 'flame' and 'fire' are mentioned; and because it is said that 'His eyes were as a flame of fire' the Divine Wisdom of the Divine Love is signified.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 48</h4><p>48. And His eyes were as a flame of fire signifies the Divine wisdom of the Divine love. By "eyes," in the Word, is meant the understanding, and thence, by the sight of the eyes, intelligence; therefore, when spoken of the Lord, the Divine wisdom is meant; but by a "flame of fire" is signified spiritual love, which is charity; wherefore, when spoken of the Lord, the Divine love is meant; hence, then, by "His eyes were like a flame of fire" is signified the Divine wisdom of the Divine love.

Since by "eye" is signified the understanding of truth, therefore it was among the statutes of the sons of Israel, that:<p>One blind, or disordered in the eye from the seed of Aaron, should not come nigh to offer sacrifice; nor enter within the veil, (<a href="3927/leviticus_21_18.htm">Leviticus 21:18</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_21_20.htm">20</a>);<p>Then that anything blind should not be offered in sacrifice, (<a href="3927/leviticus_22_22.htm">Leviticus 22:22</a>; <a href="3927/malachi_1_8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>).</p><p>[4] From these things it is evident what is meant by "eye," when predicated of a man; hence it follows, that by "eye," when predicated of the Lord, His Divine wisdom is meant, as also His Divine omniscience and providence; as in these passages:<p>Open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see, (<a href="3927/isaiah_37_17.htm">Isaiah 37:17</a>).<p>I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will build them, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_24_6.htm">Jeremiah 24:6</a>).<p>Behold the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear Him, (<a href="3927/psalms_33_18.htm">Psalms 33:18</a>).<p>Jehovah is in the temple of holiness, His eyes behold, His eyelids try the sons of man, (<a href="3927/psalms_11_4.htm">Psalms 11:4</a>).<p>Since by "cherubs" is signified the guard and providence of the Lord lest the spiritual sense of the Word should be injured; therefore it is said of the four animals which were cherubs, that:<p>They were full of eyes before and behind, and their wings were likewise full of eyes, (<a href="3927/revelation_4_6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_4_8.htm">8</a>);<p>The wheels upon which the cherubs were drawn, were full of eyes round about, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_10_12.htm">Ezekiel 10:12</a>).</p><p>[5] That by "a flame of fire" is meant His Divine love, will be seen in what follows, where "flame" and "fire" are mentioned; and because it is said, that "His eyes were as a flame of fire," the Divine wisdom of the Divine love is signified. That in the Lord there is the Divine love of the Divine wisdom, and the Divine wisdom of the Divine love, and thus a reciprocal union of both, is an arcanum disclosed in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom, (<a href="34.htm">34-39</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 48 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>48. "Et Oculi Ipsius tanquam flamma ignis," significat Divinam Sapientiam Divini Amoris. - Per "Oculos" in Verbo intelligitur Intellectus, ac inde per visum Oculorum, Intelligentia; quare cum de Domino, intelligitur Divina Sapientia; per "Flammam ignis" autem significatur Amor spiritualis qui est Charitas, quare cum de Domino, intelligitur Divinus Amor; inde nunc per quod "Oculi Ipsius essent tanquam Flamma ignis," significatur Divina Sapientia Divini Amoris. Quod "Oculus" significet Intellectum, est quia correspondent; nam sicut Oculus videt ex luce naturali, ita Intellectus ex luce spirituali; quare "Videre" praedicatur de utroque. Quod per "Oculum" in Verbo significetur Intellectus, patet a sequentibus his locis: <p>"Educ populum caecum cui Oculi sunt, et surdos quibus Aures," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_48/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_43_8" target=_top>Esaias 43:8</a>);<p>"Audient in die illo surdi verba Libri, et ex caligine Oculi caecorum videbunt," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_48/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_29_18" target=_top>Esaias 29:18</a>);<p>"Tunc aperientur Oculi caecorum, et Aures surdorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_48/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_35_5" target=_top>Esaias 35:5</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>"Dabo Te in lucem gentium ad aperiendum Oculos caecorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_48/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_42_6-7" target=_top>Esaias 42:6-7</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>haec de Domino, Qui, dum venturus est, aperiet Intellectum apud illos qui in ignorantia veri sunt.
