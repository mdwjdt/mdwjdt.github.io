<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第314节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>314.启6:6.“我听见在四活物中间似乎有声音说”表主对圣言的神性保护。“四个活物”或基路伯表示从初至终的圣言，以及保护，免得它的内层真理与良善遭到侵犯（参看<a href="239.htm">239</a>节）；由于这些保护来自主，所以约翰所听见的声音在四个活物中间。“在四个活物中间”表示圣言的内在灵义，这灵义正是主所保护的。所表示的是保护，这一点从下面的话明显看出来：</p><p>一钱银子买一升麦子，一钱银子买三升大麦，油和酒不可糟蹋。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.6.htm">6:6</a>）</p><p>之所以用它来表示，是因为良善与真理的估价如此之小，以至于什么也不是，故必须规定内藏于圣言的神圣良善与真理不可遭到侵犯和亵渎；主以这种方式如此规定，是叫他们最终不知道任何良善，并由此不知道任何真理，只知道邪恶与虚假。事实上，只有知道良善与真理的人才能侵犯，甚至亵渎它们，而不知道的人则不能。这就是圣治保护圣言的运作，这一点可见于《圣治》（<a href="../dp/221.htm">221</a>-233，<a href="../dp/257.htm">257</a>末尾，<a href="../dp/258.htm">258</a>开头等节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 314</h4><p>314. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying. (<a href="3927/revelation_6_6.htm">6:6</a>) This symbolizes the Divine protection of the Word by the Lord.<p>To be shown that the four living creatures or cherubim symbolize the Word from the firsts of it in its lasts, and its protections to keep its interior truths and goods from being violated, see no. <a href="239.htm">239</a> above. Moreover, because these protections come from the Lord, therefore John heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures. In the midst of them means the Word in respect to its inner, spiritual sense, which the Lord protects.<p>That the symbolism is one of protection is apparent from what the voice said, "A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine," which symbolically means that because the value these people placed on goodness and truth was so little as to be scarcely anything, provision had to be made to keep them from violating and profaning the sacred goods and truths that lie hidden interiorly in the Word. And the Lord provided this by their at last knowing not any good and so not any truth, but only evil and falsity. For people who know goods and truths can violate them, indeed profane them, but not people who are ignorant of them.<p>To be shown that this is Divinely provided to protect the Word, see Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Providence, nos. <a href="../dp/221.htm">221-233</a>, <a href="../dp/257.htm">257</a> at the end, and <a href="../dp/258.htm">258</a> at the beginning. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 314</h4><p>314. [verse 6] 'And I heard a voice in the midst of the four animals saying' signifies the Divine protection of the Word by the Lord. That 'the four animals' or cherubs signify the Word from firsts in ultimates, and guards lest its interior truths and goods should be violated, may be seen above (<a href="239.htm">239</a>); and because these guards are from the Lord, therefore the voice was heard in the midst of the four animals. By 'in the midst' of them is understood the Word as to its spiritual internal sense, which the Lord guards. That a 'guard' is signified is plain from the things that it said, 'a measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny, and do not hurt the oil and the wine,' by which is signified 'because the evaluation of good and truth is so very little as to be scarcely anything, it is provided that the holy goods and truths that lie hidden interiorly in the Word should not be violated and profaned'; and this is provided by the Lord by this means, that at length they do not know any good nor consequently any truth, but what is altogether evil and untrue; for they who know goods and truths can violate and even profane them, but not so those who do not know. That this is the Divine Providence for guarding the Word may be seen in <a href="../dp/221.htm">ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE PROVIDENCE 221-233</a>, <a href="../dp/257.htm">257</a> end, and <a href="../dp/258.htm">ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE PROVIDENCE 258</a> beginning). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 314</h4><p>314. Verse 6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four animals, saying, signifies the Divine guard of the Word by the Lord. That "the four animals" or cherubs signify the Word from firsts to ultimates, and guards lest its interior truths and goods should be violated, may be seen above, (<a href="239.htm">239</a>); and because these guards are from the Lord, the voice was therefore heard in the midst of the four animals. By "in the midst" of them is meant the Word as to its internal spiritual sense, which the Lord guards. That a guard is signified, is manifest from the things that it said:<p>A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and hurt not the oil and the wine, (<a href="3927/revelation_6_6.htm">Revelation 6:6</a>);<p>by which is signified that because the estimation of good and truth is so trifling that it is scarcely anything, it must be provided that the holy goods and truths, which lie hid interiorly in the Word, should not be violated and profaned; and this is provided by the Lord by this means, that they at length do not know any good, and thence neither any truth, but mere evil and falsity: for they who know goods and truths can violate, yea, they can profane them, but not so they who do not know them. That such is the operation of the Divine providence in guarding the Word, may be seen in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Providence, (<a href="221.htm">221-233</a>; no. <a href="257.htm">257</a>, the end; <a href="258.htm">258</a>, the beginning). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 314 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>314. (Vers. 6.) "Et audivi vocem in medio quatuor Animalium dicentem," significat Divinam custodiam Verbi a Domino. -Quod "quatuor Animalia" seu Cherubi, significent Verbum a primis in ultimis, et custodias ne vera et bona interiora ejus violentur, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_314/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_239" target=_top>239</a>); et quia custodiae illae sunt a Domino, ideo audita est vox in medio quatuor Animalium; per "in medio" illorum intelligitur Verbum quoad Sensum internum spiritualem, quem Dominus custodit. Quod custodia significetur, patet ab illis quae dixit, "Choenix tritici denario, et tres choenices hordei denario, et oleum et vinum ne laeseris;" per quae significatur, quia aestimatio boni et veri tam pusilla est ut vix ulla, providebitur ne sancta bona et vera, quae interius in Verbo latent, violentur et prophanentur; et hoc providetur a Domino per id, quod tandem non sciant aliquod bonum, et inde nec aliquod verum, sed mere malum et falsum; nam qui sciunt bona et vera, possunt violare, imo prophanare illa, non autem qui non sciunt, Quod haec sit Divina Providentia ad custodiendum Verbum, videatur in Sapientia Angelica de <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_314/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_221" target=_top>Divina Providentia 221-233</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_314/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_257" target=_top>257</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_314/swedenborg_de-divina-providentia_258" target=_top>258</a> princ.. </p>
