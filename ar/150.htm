<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第150节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>150.“像我从我父所领受的一样”表他们从主拥有这种权能，祂在世时通过祂里面的神性为自己获取制伏地狱的一切权能。主在世时通过允许加在祂身上的试探，直到试探的最终极限，也就是十字架受难而征服地狱，荣耀了祂的人性。这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》（<a href="../lord/29.htm">29</a>-36节），还可见于上文（<a href="67.htm">67</a>节）。由此明显可知，“从我父领受”就是从在祂自己里面的神性领受，因为主说：父在祂里面，祂在父里面（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">14:11</a>），父与祂为一（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.30.htm">10:30</a>），以及“在我里面的父”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.10.htm">14:10</a>）等。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 150</h4><p>150. "'As I also have received from My Father.'" This symbolically means that this will befall them owing to the Lord, who, when He was in the world, acquired for Himself all power over the hells, by virtue of His Divinity that He had in Him.<p>When the Lord was in the world, He conquered the hells and glorified His humanity through the temptations or trials that He suffered, and finally through the last of them, which was His suffering of the cross. See The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord, nos. <a href="../lord/29.htm">29-36</a> and no. <a href="67.htm">67</a> above. It may be seen from these that to receive from His Father is to receive from the Divine that was in Him; for He said that the Father was in Him and He in the Father, <sup>1</sup>and that He and the Father are one, <sup>2</sup>and He referred to "the Father who is in Me," <sup>3</sup>and more.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="3927/john_10_38.htm">John 10:38</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">14:10-11</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_20.htm">20</a>; <a href="3927/john_17_21.htm">17:21</a>.<p>2.&nbsp;<a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>; <a href="3927/john_17_11.htm">17:11</a>.<p>3.&nbsp;<a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">John 14:10</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 150</h4><p>150. 'Even as I have accepted from My Father' signifies that they shall have this from the Lord, Who, when He was in the world, furnished Himself with all power over the hells out of His Own Divine that was in Himself. That the Lord, when He was in the world, by means of the temptations admitted into Himself, and at last by means of the utmost limit thereof, which was the passion of the cross, subjugated the hells and glorified His Human, may be seen in <a href="../lord/29.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD 29-36</a>; also above in <a href="67.htm">67</a>. From these things it can be established that 'to accept from His Father' is from the Divine that was in Himself; for He said that the Father is in Him and He in the Father [<a href="3927/john_14_11.htm">John 14:11</a>], that the Father and He are One [<a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>]; also, 'The Father, Who is in Me' [<a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">John 14:10</a>]; and more. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 150</h4><p>150. Even as I have received from My Father, signifies that they have this from the Lord, who, when He was in the world procured to Himself all power over the hells, from His Divine which was in Himself. That the Lord, when He was in the world, by admitting temptations into Himself, and finally by the last of them, which was the passion of the cross, subjugated the hells and glorified His Human, may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord, (<a href="29.htm">29-36</a>); as also above, (<a href="67.htm">67</a>); from which it may appear, that "to receive from His Father" is to receive from the Divine which was in Him, for He said that "the Father is in Him and He in the Father;" that "the Father and He are one;" as also "the Father who is in Me;" and more. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 150 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>150. "Sicut et Ego accepi a Patre Meo," significat quod hoc erit illis a Domino, Qui Sibi omnem potentiam super Inferna, dum fuit in mundo, ex Divino Suo quod in Ipso, comparavit. - Quod Dominus, cum in Mundo fuit, per Tentationes in Se admissas, ac demum per ultimam illarum, quae fuit Passio crucis, subjugaverit Inferna, et glorificaverit Humanum Suum, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_150/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_29" target=_top>Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 29-36</a>, tum supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_150/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_67" target=_top>67</a>); ex quibus constare potest, quod "accipere a Patre Suo" sit a Divino quod fuit in Ipso, dixit enim quod "Pater in Ipso sit et Ipse in Patre;" quod "Pater et Ipse unum sint;" tum "Pater Qui in Me est;" et plura. </p>
