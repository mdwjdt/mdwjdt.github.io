<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第571节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>571.“头上有亵渎的名号”表对主的神性人的否认，和并非源自圣言，而是由自我聪明所孵化出来的教会教义。“七头”表示由纯粹的虚假所产生的疯狂（<a href="538.htm">538</a>节）；当否认主人性中的神性，以及不从圣言提取教义，而是凭自己的聪明孵化教义时，这种疯狂便说亵渎的话。关于第一点，即否认主人性中的神性就是亵渎，因为否认这一点，就是反对整个基督教界所接受的信仰，也就是所谓的《亚他那修信经》，该信经明确说明：在耶稣基督里面，神与人，也就是神性与人性，是一而非二，他们如灵魂与身体那样合为一个位格。因此，那些否认主人性里面的神性之人离苏西尼派和阿里乌斯派不远了，尤其在他们单单将主的人性视为另一人的人性，而根本不视为祂永恒的神性之时。</p><p>关于第二点，即不从圣言提取教会的教义，而是凭自己的聪明孵化它也是亵渎，因为教会来自圣言，其性质取决于对圣言的理解，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/76.htm">76</a>-79节）。而唯信的教义，也就是称义与得救是因着信，不在乎遵行律法，并非来自圣言，而是来自对保罗的一句话的错误理解（罗马书<a href="http://39-27.cn/罗3.28.htm">3:28</a>，参看｛417节）；教义的一切虚假皆源于人自己的聪明，并无别的源头。在圣言中，还有什么比避恶行善更普遍的教导吗？还有比当爱神爱邻更明显的话吗？谁看不出若不照律法行为生活，没有人能爱邻舍，不爱邻舍怎能爱神呢？只有在对邻之爱中，主才与人结合，并且人与主结合，也就是主与人一起在这爱中。何为爱邻，不就是按十诫的要求（罗马书<a href="http://39-27.cn/罗13.8.htm">13:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/罗13.11.htm">11</a>）不向他行恶吗？人不愿意向邻行恶到什么程度，就愿意向邻行善到什么程度；由此明显可知，将这律法行为排除在救恩之外就是亵渎，如那些视唯信，也就是与好行为分离之信为得救之人所行的那样。“亵渎”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.31.htm">12:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.32.htm">32</a> ；启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.3.htm">17:3</a> ；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.6.htm">37:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.24.htm">24</a>）表示否认主的神性，如苏西尼派之流所行的；还表示否认圣言；凡如此否认主的神性之人，都不能进入天堂，因为主的神性是天堂全部中的全部，凡否认圣言者皆否认宗教信仰的一切。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 571</h4><p>571. And on its heads a blasphemous name. This symbolizes their denial of the Lord's Divine humanity and affirmation of their church's doctrine, drawn not from the Word but from their own intelligence.<p>The seven heads symbolize irrationality resulting from absolute falsities, as said in no. <a href="568.htm">568</a> above. And this irrationality utters blasphemy when it denies the Lord's Divinity present in His humanity. It also does this when it does not draw the doctrine of the church from the Word, but hatches it from its own intelligence.<p>As regards the first, that it is blasphemy to deny the Lord's Divinity present in His humanity, the reason is that someone who denies it goes against the creed accepted throughout the Christian world called the Athanasian Creed, which plainly says that in Jesus Christ, God and man - which is to say, the Divine and the human - are not two but one, and that they constitute one person, being united as soul and body. Consequently people who deny the Divinity in the Lord's humanity are close to being Socinians <sup>1</sup>and Arians, <sup>2</sup>especially when they think of the Lord's humanity by itself as being like that of any other man, and do not think at all then of His Divinity from eternity.</p><p>[2] As regards the second, that it is blasphemy not to draw the doctrine of the church from the Word, but to hatch it from one's own intelligence, the reason is that the church is founded on the Word and its character is such as its understanding of the Word (see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="../ss/76.htm">76-79</a>), and the doctrine that faith alone - that is, faith apart from works of the law - justifies and saves, comes not from the Word, but from a single saying of Paul (<a href="3927/romans_3_28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>), <sup>3</sup>falsely interpreted (see no. <a href="417.htm">417</a>).<p>Moreover, every doctrinal falsity takes it origin from no other source than people's own intelligence. For what is more universally taught in the Word than to refrain from evil and do good? And what is more evident there than the precept that God is to be loved, and the neighbor also? Who does not see, too, that no one is capable of loving the neighbor unless he lives in conformity with the works of the law? Also, anyone who does not love his neighbor does not love God either, for it is in love for the neighbor that the Lord conjoins Himself with a person and that a person conjoins himself with the Lord; that is to say, that it is in that love that God and man join together. What, then, is it to love the neighbor except to refrain from doing evil to him, in accordance with the commandments of the Decalogue (<a href="3927/romans_13_8.htm">Romans 13:8-11</a>)? And to the extent a person wills not to do evil to the neighbor, to the same extent he wills to do good to him.<p>It is apparent from this that it is blasphemy to eliminate works of the law from salvation, as those people do who make faith alone the only saving faith, namely, faith divorced from good works.<p>The blasphemy referred to in <a href="3927/matthew_12_31.htm">Matthew 12:31-32</a> means to deny the Lord's Divinity, as Socinians do, and to reject the Word. For people who so deny the Lord's Divinity cannot enter heaven, as the Lord's Divinity is everything in everything connected with heaven, and anyone who rejects the Word rejects everything connected with religion.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Disciples of Laelius Socinus (born Lelio Francesco Maria Sozini), 1525-1562, and his nephew Faustus Socinus (Fausto Paolo Sozzini), 1539-1604, who rejected a number of traditional Christian doctrines, such as the Trinity, the Divinity of Christ, and original sin, and who held that Christ was miraculously begotten and that salvation is granted to those who adopt Christ's virtues as a model for their lives.<br><br>2.&nbsp;Adherents of Arianism, a theological view based on the teachings of Arius (c. 250-336), who taught that Christ the Son was a created being, not consubstantial with God the Father, and thus not fully Divine.<br><br>3.&nbsp;"Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law." But by deeds of the law, Paul meant the ritual observances of the Jewish Church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 571</h4><p>571. 'And upon his heads the name of blasphemy' signifies the denial of the Lord's Divine Human, and the doctrine of the Church not derived from the Word but hatched out of self-intelligence. By 'seven heads' is signified the insanity resulting from sheer untruths, as above (<a href="568.htm">568</a>); and this insanity is speaking blasphemy so long as it is denying the Lord's Divine in His Human, and so long as it is not selecting the doctrine of the Church out of the Word but is hatching it out of self-intelligence. In regard to the FIRST, that it is blasphemy to deny the Lord's Divine in His Human, this is because he who denies it is going against the faith received in the whole of Christendom, which is called Athanasian, where it is openly said that in Jesus Christ God and Man, that is, the Divine and the Human, are not two but one, and that they are one Person, united as soul and body. Those therefore who deny the Divine in His Human are not far from the Socinians and Arians. Certainly this is the case when they are thinking of the Lord's Only Human as the human of another man, and not at all then of His Divine from what is eternal.</p><p>[2] As regards the SECOND, that it is blasphemy not to select the doctrine of the Church out of the Word but to hatch it out of self-intelligence, this is because the Church is derived from the Word and is qualified by the understanding it has of the Word, [as] may be seen [in] <a href="../ss/76.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 76-79</a>). Also, the doctrine that faith alone, that is, faith without the works of the law, justifies and saves is not derived from the Word but from a single saying of Paul (<a href="3927/romans_3_28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>) misunderstood, [as] may be seen (<a href="417.htm">417</a>); and every untruths of doctrine derives its origin from no other source than self-intelligence. For what is more universally taught in the Word than to flee from evils and do goods? and what is more evident there than that God is to be loved, and the neighbour also? And who does not see that no one can love the neighbour unless he is living in accordance with the works of the law? And he who does not love his neighbour does not love God, for in love of the neighbour the Lord conjoins Himself with a man and the man conjoins himself with the Lord, that is, the Lord and the man are together in that love. And what is loving the neighbour but not doing him evil in accordance with the precepts of the Decalogue (<a href="3927/romans_13_8.htm">Romans 13:8-11</a>)? And in so far as a man is not willing to do evil to the neighbour, so far he is willing to do him good. In consequence of these things it is plain that it is blasphemy to exclude the works of the law from salvation, as those do who make faith alone, which is a faith separated from the goods of charity, the sole means of salvation. By 'blasphemy' (<a href="3927/matthew_12_31.htm">Matthew 12:31-32</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_17_3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_37_6.htm">Isaiah 37:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_37_23.htm">23-24</a>) is understood to deny the Lord's Divine, as the Socinians do, and to deny the Word; for he who so denies the Lord's Divine cannot enter heaven, for the Lord's Divine is the all in all of heaven and he who denies the Word denies all things of religion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 571</h4><p>571. And upon his heads the name of blasphemy, signifies the denial of the Lord's Divine Human and the doctrine of the church derived not from the Word, but from one's own intelligence. By "seven heads" is signified insanity from mere falsities, as above, (<a href="568.htm">568</a>); and this insanity speaks blasphemy, when it denies the Lord's Divine in His Human; and also when it does not draw the doctrine of the church from the Word, but hatches it from its own intelligence. As to the first, that it is blasphemy to deny the Lord's Divine in His Human, the reason is that he who denies it is opposed to the faith received throughout the whole Christian world, named from Athanasius, where it is expressly said, that in Jesus Christ, God and Man, that is, the Divine and the Human, are not two but one, and that they are one Person, united like soul and body. Therefore they who deny the Divine in His Human, are not far from the Socinians and Arians, especially when they think of the Lord's Human alone as of that of another man, and nothing at all of His Divine from eternity.</p><p>[2] As to the second, that it is blasphemy not to draw the doctrine of the church from the Word, but to hatch it out of one's own intelligence, the reason is, because the church is from the Word, and its quality is according to the understanding of the Word, as may be seen in the <a href="../ss/76.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture 76-79</a>. And the doctrine that faith alone, that is, faith without the works of the law, justifies and saves, is not from the Word, but from a single expression of Paul falsely understood, (<a href="3927/romans_3_28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>, see <a href="417.htm">417</a>); and every falsity of doctrine is derived from no other source than from one's own intelligence. For what is more universally taught in the Word, than to shun evil and do good? And what is more evident than that God and the neighbor ought to be loved? And who does not see, that no one can love the neighbor, unless he lives according to the works of the law, and he who does not love his neighbor does not love God? For in the love of the neighbor the Lord conjoins himself with man, and man conjoins himself with the Lord, that is, the Lord and man are together in that love. And what is it to love the neighbor but not to do him evil, according to the commandments of the Decalogue, (<a href="3927/romans_13_8.htm">Romans 13:8-11</a>)? And as far as man does not will to do evil to the neighbor, so far he is willing to do him good; hence it is evident that it is blasphemy to exclude the works of this law from salvation, as they do, who make faith alone saving, which is faith separated from good works. By "blasphemy" (<a href="3927/matthew_12_31.htm">Matthew 12:31-32</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_17_3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_37_6.htm">Isaiah 37:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_37_23.htm">23-24</a>) is meant to deny the Lord's Divine, as the Socinians do, and to deny the Word; for they who thus deny the Lord's Divine cannot enter heaven, for the Lord's Divine is the all in all in heaven, and he who denies the Word denies all things of religion. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 571 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>571. "Et super capitibus suis nomen blasphemiae," significat negationem Divini Humani Domini, et doctrinam Ecclesiae non ex Verbo, sed ex propria intelligentia exclusam. - Per "septem capita" significatur insania ex meris falsis, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_571/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_568" target=_top>568</a>); et haec insania loquitur blasphemiam, dum negat Divinum Domini in Humano Ipsius; et quoque dum doctrinam Ecclesiae non ex Verbo desumit, sed illam ex propria intelligentia excludit. Quod primum attinet, quod blasphemia sit negare Divinum Domini in Humano Ipsius, est quia ille qui negat, est contra fidem in universo Christiano Orbe receptam, quae Athanasiana vocatur, ubi manifeste dicitur, Quod in Jesu Christo Deus et Homo, hoc est, Divinum et Humanum, non sint duo, sed unum, et quod sint una Persona, unita ut anima et corpus; quare qui negant Divinum in Humano Ipsius, non procul sunt a Socinianis et Arianis, nimirum tunc quando de Solo Humano Domini sicut de humano alterius hominis, et prorsus nihil tunc de Divino Ipsius ab aeterno, cogitant. Quod alterum attinet, quod sit blasphemia doctrinam Ecclesiae non ex Verbo desumere, sed illam ex propria intelligentia excludere, est quia Ecclesia est ex Verbo, et talis est qualis ei intellectus Verbi, videatur Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_571/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_76" target=_top>76-79</a>); et Doctrina quod sola Fides, hoc est, Fides absque Operibus Legis, justificet et salvet, non est ex Verbo, sed ex unico dicto Pauli, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_571/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_romans_3_28" target=_top>Romanos 3:28</a>), false intellecto (videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_571/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_417" target=_top>417</a>); et omne falsum doctrinae non aliunde originem ducit quam ex propria intelligentia. Quid enim universalius in Verbo docetur quam fugere malum et facere bonum, et quid ibi exstantius quam quod Deus amandus sit, et quod proximus; et quis non videt quod nemo amare proximum possit nisi vivat secundum opera Legis, et qui non amat proximum nec amat Deum; nam in amore proximi Dominus Se cum homine et homo se cum Domino conjungit, hoc est, Dominus et homo in illo amore simul sunt; et quid est amare proximum, quam non facere ei malum, secundum praecepta Decalogi, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_571/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_romans_13_8-11" target=_top>Romanos 13:8-11</a>); et quantum homo non vult facere proximo malum, tantum vult ei facere bonum. Ex his patet quod blasphemia sit, Opera hujus Legis excludere a salvatione, ut faciunt qui solam Fidem, quae est Fides separata a bonis Operibus, unice salvificam faciunt. Per "blasphemiam,"<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_571/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_12_31-32" target=_top>Matthaeus 12:31-32</a>. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_571/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_17_3" target=_top>Apocalypsis 17:3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_571/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_37_6-7" target=_top>Esaias 37:6-7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_571/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_37_23-24" target=_top>23-24</a>, intelligitur negare Divinum Domini, ut faciunt Sociniani, et negare Verbum; nam qui ita negant Divinum Domini, non potest intrare Caelum, Divinum enim Domini est omne in omnibus Caeli; et qui negat Verbum, is negat omnia religionis. </p>
