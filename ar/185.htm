<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第185节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>185.“你既遵守我忍耐的道”表因他们与邪恶争战，然后弃绝虚假。“我忍耐的道”表示属灵的争战，也就是所谓的试探或试炼。这一点从下句经文明显可知，即：“我也必保守你免去将要临到的试炼的时刻”；因为在世受试炼的人，死后将免受试炼。属灵的争战，也就是试炼或试探，之所以被称为“主忍耐的道”，是因为在试炼或试探中，主为人争战，并且凭出于其圣言的真理争战。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 185</h4><p>185. "'Because you have kept My command to persevere.'" (<a href="3927/revelation_3_10.htm">3:10</a>) This symbolically means, because they have fought against evils and then rejected falsities.<p>The command to persevere means, symbolically, a spiritual battle, called temptation or a trial. This is apparent from the words that follow next, "I also will keep you from the hour of trial which shall come," for someone who is tried in the world is not tried after death.<p>A spiritual battle, which is what temptation or a trial is, is called the Lord's command to persevere or endure, because in temptations or trials the Lord battles for a person, and He does so by means of truths derived from His Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 185</h4><p>185. [verse 10] 'Because thou hast kept the word of My endurance' signifies because they have fought against evils, and rejected untruths while doing so. That by 'the word of My endurance' is signified the spiritual fight that is called temptation is plain from the words that now follow, 'I also will keep thee safe from the hour of temptation that is going to come'; for he who is tempted in the world is not tempted after death. The spiritual fight that is temptation is termed 'the word of the Lord's endurance or patience,' because the Lord fights for man in temptations, and He fights by means of truths out of His Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 185</h4><p>185. Verse 10. Because thou hast kept the word of My endurance, signifies because they have fought against evils, and then have rejected falsities. That "the word of endurance" signifies spiritual combat, which is called temptation, is plain from what next follows: "I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall be;" for he who is tempted in the world, is not tempted after death. Spiritual combat, which is temptation, is called the word of the Lord's endurance or patience, because in temptations the Lord fights for man, and He fights by means of truths out of His Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 185 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>185. (Vers. 10.) "Quia servasti Verbum tolerantiae Meae," significat quia pugnaverunt contra mala, et tunc rejecerunt falsa. - Quod per "verbum tolerantiae significetur pugna spiritualis, quae vocatur tentatio, patet ex nunc sequentibus, "Et ego servabo te ab hora tentationis futurae;" nam qui tentatur in mundo, is non tentatur post mortem. Pugna spiritualis, quae est tentatio, dicitur verbum tolerantiae seu patientiae "Domini, quia Dominus in tentationibus pugnat pro homine, et pugnat per vera ex Verbo Suo. </p>
