<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>613.“都有祂父的名，写在额上”表出于他们里面的爱和信而对主的神性和神性人的承认。“父的名”表示在万物皆来自、并被称为父的神性和被称为子的神性人方面的主，因为这二者如同灵魂与身体那样合而为一，是一个位格；因此，在天上，“父神”除了指主，并非指其他人，在新天堂，主也被称为父。此处经上之所以说“有祂父的名在额上”，还因为“父”表示主的神性之爱的神性良善，在福音书的圣言中，当称呼为主时，“父”处处表示神性之爱的神性良善，“子”则表示神性智慧的神性真理。当主荣耀了祂的人性时，这二者如同灵魂与身体，并身体与灵魂那样合一（21，<a href="170.htm">170</a>节）；由于这二者为一，故经上在别处说“神和羔羊的名字在他们的额上”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.4.htm">22:4</a>）。因此，论到此处所论述的这些人，经上说他们“有父的名写在额上”，因为“以色列十二支派中受印的有十四万四千”表示高层天堂的天使，他们都处于属天之爱的良善，而“父”表示这良善，如前所述。此处所论述的天使是高层天堂的天使，这一点可见于第七章的解读，尤其<a href="369.htm">369</a>节。“写在额上”表示凭他们里面的爱和信仰而承认，“写”或“写在”表示他们里面的承认，“额”表示爱和由此而来的聪明或信仰（<a href="347.htm">347</a>，<a href="605.htm">605</a>节）。</p><p>被称为“父”的神性与被称为“子”的神性人如灵魂与身体那样为一，所以要靠近主的神性人，并以此而非其它方式靠近被称为“父”的神性；证明这一点的圣言经文有很多，若加以引用，会占用大量篇幅。《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》（<a href="../lord/29.htm">29</a>-36，<a href="../lord/38.htm">38</a>-45节等）一书引用了许多，在此仅从中引用以下少许经文用来确认：</p><p>天使对马利亚说，看哪，你要怀孕生子，可以给祂起名叫耶稣。祂要为大，称为至高者的儿子。马利亚对天使说，我没有亲近男人，怎么有这事呢？天使回答说，圣灵要临到你身上，至高者的能力要荫庇你，因此你所要生的圣者必称为神的儿子。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路 1.30.htm"> 1:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路 1.35.htm">35</a>）</p><p>有主的使者在梦中向约瑟显现，说，不要怕，只管娶过你的新妇马利亚来，因她所怀的孕是从圣灵来的；约瑟没有和她同房，直到等她生了头生子。（马太福音<a

href="http://39-27.cn/约1.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）</p><p>犹太人想要杀耶稣，因祂称神为祂的父，将自己和神当作平等。耶稣回答说，凡父所做的事，子也照样做；父怎样叫死人起来，使他们活着，子也照样随自己的意思使人活着；我实实在在地告诉你们，时候将到，死人要听见神儿子的声音、听见的人就要活了。（约翰福音<a

href="http://39-27.cn/约5.26.htm">5:26</a>）</p><p>我就是道路，真理，生命；若不藉着我，没有人能到父那里去；你们若认识我，也就认识我的父；从今以后，你们认识祂，并且已经看见祂。腓力对祂说，求主将父显给我们看；耶稣对他说，腓力，我与你们同在这样长久，你还不认识我吗？人看见了我，就是看见了父；你怎么说将父显给我们看呢？我在父里面，父在我里面，你不信吗？你们当信我，我在父里面，父在我里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约 14.6.htm"> 14:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约 14.11.htm">11</a>）</p><p>我赐给我的羊永生；我与父原为一。犹太人恼怒祂将自己当作神；祂说，我行父的事；当信这些事；叫你们又知道又相信父在我里面，我在父里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.28.htm">10:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.38.htm">38</a>）</p><p>人看见我，就是看见那差我来的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.45.htm">12:45</a>）</p><p>凡父所有的，都是我的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.15.htm">16:15</a>）</p><p>父已将万有交在祂手里。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.3.htm">13:3</a>）</p><p>父啊，你曾赐给我权柄管理凡有血气的；认识你，独一的真神，并且认识你所差来的耶稣基督，这就是永生。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.1.htm">17:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>天上地上所有的权柄都赐给我了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">28:18</a> ）</p><p>你们奉我的名无论求什么，我必成就；我必成就。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约 14.13.htm"> 14:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约

href="http://39-27.cn/约15.5.htm">15:5</a>；等等）</p><p>旧约中的此类经文更多，仅从中引用少许:</p><p>因有一婴孩为我们而生，有一子赐给我们。政权必担在祂的肩头上，祂名称为奇妙、策士、神、勇士、永恒的父、和平的君！（以赛亚书<a

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 613</h4><p>613. Having His Father's name written on their foreheads. This symbolizes the acknowledgment out of love and faith among them of the Lord's Divinity and of His Divine humanity.<p>The name of the Father means the Lord in respect to the Divine called the Father from which springs all else, and at the same time in respect to His Divine humanity called the Son, since the two are one and the same person, united like a soul and body. In heaven, therefore, no other father than the Lord is meant by God the Father, and in the new heaven the Lord is also called Father.<p>We are told here that they had the Father's name on their foreheads because the Father also means the Divine goodness of the Lord's Divine love, which in the Gospels is everywhere meant by the Father when referred to by the Lord, while the Divine truth of His Divine wisdom is meant by the Son. When the Lord glorified His humanity, these two were united like a soul with its body and a body with its soul (see nos. <a href="21.htm">21</a>, <a href="170.htm">170</a>).<p>Because the two are one, therefore we find reference elsewhere to the name of God and of the Lamb being "on their foreheads" (<a href="3927/revelation_22_4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>). Therefore, with respect to the people who are the subject here, we are told that they had the Father's name written on their foreheads, inasmuch as the 144,000 that were sealed of the twelve tribes of Israel mean angels of the higher heavens, all of whom are prompted by the goodness of celestial love, and that is, as we said, the love meant by the Father.<p>That the angels who are the subject here are angels of the higher heavens may be seen in the exposition of chapter 7, especially in no. <a href="369.htm">369</a> there.<p>Having the name written on their foreheads symbolizes an acknowledgment in them out of love and faith - having it written or inscribed symbolizing an acknowledgment in them, and the forehead symbolizing love and the resulting intelligence or faith (nos. <a href="347.htm">347</a>, <a href="605.htm">605</a>).</p><p>[2] We say that the Divine called the Father and the Divine humanity called the Son are one like a soul and body, consequently that people must approach the Lord in His Divine humanity, and that in this way and in no other is the Divine called the Father approached; and this can be seen from so many passages in the Word that they would fill pages if we were to cite them all. We cited a number of them in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord, nos. <a href="../lord/29.htm">29-36</a> <a href="../lord/38.htm">38-45</a>, and later, and by way of confirmation we will present only some of them here, as follows:<p>The angel said to (Mary), ."..behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest...."<p>But Mary said..., "How shall this be, since I do not know a man?"<p>The angel answered..., "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore... the Holy One who is to be born of you will be called the Son of God. (<a href="3927/luke_1_30.htm">Luke 1:30-35</a>)<p>...an angel of the Lord appeared to (Joseph) in a dream, saying, ."..do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit...." ...and (Joseph) did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. (<a href="3927/matthew_1_20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_1_25.htm">25</a>)<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... And the Word became flesh..., and we beheld His glory, as though the glory of the only begotten of the Father... (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>)<p>...the Jews sought... to kill (Jesus), because He... said that God was His Father, making Himself equal to God. Jesus answered..., ."..whatever (the Father) does, the Son also does in like manner. ...as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom He will. ...assuredly, I say to you, the hour is coming... when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. (<a href="3927/john_5_18.htm">John 5:18-25</a>)<p>...as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself... (<a href="3927/john_5_26.htm">John 5:26</a>)<p>"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on you know Him and have seen Him."<p>Philip said to Him, ."..show us the Father...."<p>Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you so long a time, and have you not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how then do you say, 'Show us the Father'? Do you not believe that I dwell in the Father, and the Father in Me? ...Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me...." (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6-11</a>)<p>"I give (My sheep) eternal life... I and My Father are one."<p>(Then the Jews were angered that He made Himself God. And He said, "I do the works of My Father.") ."..believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him." (<a href="3927/john_10_28.htm">John 10:28-38</a>)<p>"He who sees Me sees Him who sent Me." (<a href="3927/john_12_45.htm">John 12:45</a>)<p>"All things that the Father has are Mine."

God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent... All that is Mine are Yours, and what are Yours are Mine...." (<a href="3927/john_17_1.htm">John 17:1-3</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_10.htm">10</a>)<p>"All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth." (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>)<p>"Whatever you ask in My name, that I will do...." (And) "I will do it."

(<a href="3927/john_15_5.htm">John 15:5</a>)</p><p>[3] And so on. There are still more passages in the Old Testament, some of which we will present also:<p>...unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. (<a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>)<p>A virgin shall conceive... a Son, and His name shall be called God-With-Us.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 613</h4><p>613. 'Having His Father's Name written upon their foreheads' signifies the acknowledgment of the Divine and of the Lord's Divine Human by virtue of the love and faith with them. By 'the Father's Name' is understood the Lord as to the Divine from Whom [all things are] which is called 'the Father,' and at the same time as to the Divine Human which is called 'the Son,' since they are one and one Person, united as soul and body. In heaven, therefore, by 'God the Father' is understood none other than the Lord; and also the Lord in the New Heaven is called 'Father.' It is here said 'the Father's Name upon their foreheads' because also by 'the Father' is understood the Divine Good of the Lord's Divine Love which in the Word of the Evangelists is everywhere understood by 'the Father' when named by the Lord, and by 'the Son' the Divine Truth of Divine Wisdom. These two were united as soul to body and body to soul when the Lord glorified His Human, as may be seen (<a href="21.htm">21</a>, <a href="170.htm">170</a>); and because they are one it is therefore said elsewhere 'the Name of God and the Lamb upon their foreheads' (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_22_4.htm">22:4</a>). It is therefore said of those who are treated of here that they had 'the Father's Name written upon [their] foreheads,' because by the 144000 sealed out of the 12 tribes of Israel are understood the angels of the higher heavens, all of whom are in the good of celestial love, and by 'the Father,' as was said, that good is understood. That the angels of whom it treats here are the angels of the higher heavens may be seen in the Exposition of chapter <a href="3927/revelation_7_1.htm">7</a>, specifically at <a href="363.htm">363</a> there. By 'written upon [their] foreheads' is signified the acknowledgment by virtue of the love and faith in them, by 'written' or 'written upon' is signified the acknowledgment in them, and by 'the forehead 'is signified love and the consequent intelligence or faith (<a href="347.htm">347</a>, <a href="605.htm">605</a>).</p><p>[2] That the Divine that is called 'Father' and the Divine Human that is called 'Son' are one like soul and body, and consequently that the Lord as to the Divine Human is to be approached, and that thus and not otherwise is the Divine that is called 'Father' approached, can be established out of so many passages in the Word that if quoted they would fill many pages. They have been adduced in ample measure in <a href="../lord/29.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD 29-36</a>, <a href="../lord/38.htm">38-45</a> seq., out of which only some shall be quoted here, which are these:<p>The angel said to Mary, Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a Son, and shalt call His Name Jesus.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 613</h4><p>613. Having His father's name written on their foreheads, signifies their acknowledgment of the Lord's Divine and Divine Human from love and faith with them. By "the name of the Father" is meant the Lord as to the Divine from whom all things are, which is called the Father, and at the same time, as to the Divine Human, which is called the Son, because they are One and one Person, united like soul and body; for which reason, in heaven, by "God the Father" no other is meant than the Lord, and the Lord is also called Father in the New Heaven. The reason why it is here said, "the name of His Father on their foreheads," is also because by "Father" is meant the Divine good of the Lord's Divine love, which in the Word of the Evangelists is everywhere meant by "the Father," when named by the Lord, and the Divine truth of the Divine wisdom by "the Son;" which two were united as soul to body and body to soul, when the Lord glorified His Human (see <a href="21.htm">21</a>, <a href="170.htm">170</a>); and since they are one, it is therefore said in another place:<p>The name of God and of the Lamb on their forehead, (<a href="3927/revelation_22_4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>).<p>Concerning these, therefore, who are here treated of, it is said, that "they had the Father's name written on their foreheads," because by "the one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed out of the twelve tribes of Israel," are meant the angels of the higher heavens, who are all in the good of celestial love, and by the Father, as was said, that good is meant. That the angels here treated of are angels of the higher heavens, may be seen in the explanation of chapter 7, particularly at <a href="362.htm">362</a>. By "written on their foreheads" is signified acknowledgment from love and faith in them; by "written" or "inscribed" is signified acknowledgment in them, and by "the forehead" is signified love and thence intelligence or faith, (<a href="347.htm">347</a>, <a href="605.htm">605</a>).</p><p>[2] That the Divine, which is called the Father, and the Divine Human, which is called the Son, are One, like soul and body, and consequently that the Lord is to be approached as to the Divine Human, and that thus and not otherwise the Divine, which is called the Father, is approached, appears from so many passages in the Word, that they would fill many pages, if they were to be adduced; a large collection of them may be found in The <a href="../lord/29.htm">Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord 29-36</a>, <a href="../lord/38.htm">38-45</a>, and following; from which a few only shall here be quoted by way of confirmation, which are these:<p>The angel said to Mary, Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a Son, and shalt call His name Jesus.

Quod hic dicatur "Nomen Patris in frontibus illorum," est quoque quia per "Patrem" intelligitur Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris Domini, quod in Verbo Evangelistarum ubivis intelligitur per "Patrem" cum a Domino nominatur, ac Divinum Verum Divinae Sapientiae per "Filium;" quae duo unita sunt sicut anima corpori et corpus animae, quando Dominus Humanum Suum glorificavit (videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_613/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_21" target=_top>21</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_613/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_170" target=_top>170</a>); et quia unum sunt, ideo dicitur alibi, <p>"Nomen Dei et Agni in frontibus suis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_613/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_22_4" target=_top>22:4</a>).<p>De his itaque, de quibus hic agitur, dicitur quod "Nomen Patris haberent scriptum in frontibus," quia per "centum quadraginta quatuor millia signatos ex duodecim tribubus Israelis" intelliguntur Angeli superiorum Caelorum, qui omnes in Bono amoris caelestis sunt, et per "Patrem," ut dictum est, id Bonum intelligitur. Quod angeli, de quibus hic agitur, sint Angeli superiorum Caelorum, videatur in Explicatione capitis septimi, in specie <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_613/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_369" target=_top>369</a>, <sup>1</sup>ibi. Per "scriptum in frontibus" significatur agnitio ex amore et fide in illis; per "scriptum" seu "inscriptum" significatur agnitio in illis, et per "frontem" significatur amor et inde intelligentia seu fides (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_613/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_347" target=_top>347</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_613/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_605" target=_top>605</a>). Quod Divinum quod Pater vocatur, ac Divinum Humanum quod Filius, sint unum sicut anima et corpus, et consequenter quod Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum adeundus sit, et quod ita et non aliter adeatur Divinum quod Pater vocatur, constare potest ex tam multis locis in Verbo, ut implerent membranas si adducerentur; in aliqua copia adducta sunt in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_613/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_29" target=_top>29-36</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_613/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_38" target=_top>38-45</a>, seq.); ex qua hic solum aliqua in confirmationem afferentur, quae sunt: <p>"Dixit Angelus Mariae, Ecce concipies in utero, et paries Filium, et vocabis Nomen Ejus Jesum.
