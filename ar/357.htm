<p>357.启7:7.“利未支派中受印的有一万二千”表那些将要属于主的新天堂和新教会之人所具有的对源于良善之真理的情感，聪明便由此而来。</p><p>在至高意义上，“利未”表示爱与仁慈；在属灵意义上，表示行为中的仁爱，也就是生活的良善；在属世意义上，表示联合和结合。利未因联合而得名，在圣言中，表示通过爱结合。不过，此处“利未”表示对真理的爱或情感，以及由此产生的聪明，因为他在西缅之后而来，在这个次序上形成中间的（the intermediate）。</p><p>由于利未代表这些事物，故这个支派受膏成为祭司（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民3.1.htm">3:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民3.51.htm">51</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.5.htm">21:5</a>等）。“利未支派”表示对真理的爱，也就是使得教会成为教会的本质之爱，以及由此产生的聪明。这一点可从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>耶和华拣选了利未人事奉祂，奉祂的名祝福。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.5.htm">21:5</a>）</p><p>“奉耶和华的名祝福”就是去教导，唯有那些具有对真理的情感，并由此具有聪明的人才能施行教导。</p><p>利未人遵行你的话，谨守你的约；他们要将你的典章教训雅各，将你的律法教训以色列。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.8.htm">33:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.11.htm">11</a>）</p><p>主必忽然进入祂的殿，祂必坐下如熬炼和洁净银子的，必洁净利未人，熬炼他们像金银一样。（玛拉基书3: 1-4）</p><p>“洁净利未人”就是洁净那些具有对真理的情感之人。由于这种情感通过聪明发旺，故：</p><p>利未的杖，就是上面写有亚伦名字的，开了花，结了杏仁。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民17.2.htm">17:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民17.11.htm">11</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 357</h4><p>357. Of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand were sealed. This symbolizes an affection for truth springing from goodness, producing intelligence in those people who will be part of the New Heaven and of the Lord's New Church.<p>In the highest sense Levi symbolizes love and mercy; in the spiritual sense, charity in practice, which constitutes goodness of life; and in the natural sense, association and conjunction. The name Levi also comes from a word meaning to attach, which in the Word symbolizes a conjunction by love. Here, however, Levi symbolizes a love or affection for truth and the resulting intelligence, because he comes after Simeon and is the middle one in this series.<p>Since this is what Levi represents, therefore that tribe became the priesthood (<a href="3927/numbers_3_1.htm">Numbers 3:1-51</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_21_5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>, and elsewhere).<p>That the tribe of Levi symbolizes a love of truth, which is the fundamental love that causes a church to be a church, and at the same time the resulting intelligence, can be seen from the following passages:<p>...Jehovah... has chosen (the sons of Levi) to minister to Him and to bless in (His) name. (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_21_5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>)<p>To bless in the name of Jehovah is to teach, and only those people can do this who possess an affection for truth and the resulting intelligence.<p>...they guard Your Word and keep Your covenant. They shall teach Jacob Your judgments, and Israel Your law. (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8-11</a>)<p>The Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to His temple..., and He will sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver; and He will purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver... (<a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3:1-4</a>)<p>To purify the sons of Levi is to purify people who have an affection for truth.<p>Because intelligence causes that affection to blossom, therefore the rod of Levi, with the name of Aaron written on it, blossomed with almonds (<a href="3927/numbers_17_2.htm">Numbers 17:2-11</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 357</h4><p>357. 'Out of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand sealed' signifies the affection of truth out of good which results in intelligence, with those who will belong to the New Heaven and the Lord's New Church. By 'Levi' in the highest sense is signified Love and Mercy, in the spiritual sense charity in act, which is the good of life, and in the natural sense consociation and conjunction. He was indeed so called from 'to adhere,' by which in the Word conjunction through love is signified. Here, however, by 'Levi' is signified the love or affection of truth, and the resulting intelligence, because he follows after Simeon and is the middle one in this series. Since 'Levi' used to represent these things, therefore that tribe became the priesthood (<a href="3927/numbers_3_1.htm">Numbers 3</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_21_5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; and elsewhere). That 'the tribe of Levi' signifies the love of truth, which is the very love out of which a Church is a Church, and the resulting intelligence, can be established from these passages:<p>The sons of Levi have been chosen by Jehovah to minister unto Him, and to bless in His Name. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_21_5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>.<p>To 'bless in the Name of Jehovah' is to teach, which only they are able to do who are in the affection of truth and the resulting intelligence.<p>They guard Thy Word, and keep Thy covenant, they shall teach Jacob Thy justice, and Israel Thy law. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8-11</a>.<p>The Lord shall suddenly come to His temple, and He shall sit refining and melting silver, and He shall purify the sons of Levi and shall refine them as gold and silver, <a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3</a>:[<a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">1-3</a>,] <a href="3927/malachi_3_4.htm">4</a>.<p>To 'purify the sons of Levi' is to purify those who are in the affection of truth. Because that affection blossoms as a result of intelligence, therefore the 'rod of Levi,' upon which Aaron's name was written, blossomed with almonds (<a href="3927/numbers_17_2.htm">Numbers 17:2-11</a> [H.B. 17-26]). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 357</h4><p>357. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand, signifies the affection of truth from good, from whence comes intelligence with those who will be of the Lord's New Heaven and New Church. By "Levi," in the highest sense, is signified love and mercy; in the spiritual sense, charity in act, which is the good of life; and, in the natural sense, consociation and conjunction. He was named the name also from adhering, by which, in the Word, is signified conjunction through love. But by "Levi" is here signified the love or affection of truth, and thence intelligence, because it follows after Simeon, and in this series forms the intermediate. Since Levi represented these things, therefore this tribe was appointed to the priesthood, (<a href="3927/numbers_3_1.htm">Numbers 3</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_21_5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a> and in other places). That the tribe of Levi signifies the love of truth, which is the essential love from which the church is a church, and thence intelligence, may appear from these passages:<p>The sons of Levi are chosen by Jehovah to minister unto Him, and to bless in His name, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_21_5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>).<p>"To bless in the name of Jehovah" is to teach; which they alone can do, who are in the affection of truth, and thence in intelligence.<p>They guard Thy Word, and kept Thy covenant; they shall teach Jacob Thy judgments, and Israel Thy law, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8-11</a>).<p>The Lord shall suddenly come to His temple, and He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and He shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, (<a href="3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, <a href="3927/malachi_3_3.htm">3</a>).<p>"To purify the sons of Levi," is to purify those who are in the affection of truth. As that affection flourishes from intelligence, therefore:<p>The rod of Levi, upon which was written the name of Aaron, blossomed with almonds, (<a href="3927/numbers_17_2.htm">Numbers 17:2-11</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 357 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>357. "Ex tribu Levi duodecim millia signati," significat Affectionem veri ex bono ex quo intelligentia, apud illos qui e Novo Caelo et e Nova Ecclesia Domini erunt. - Per "Levim" in Sensu supremo significatur Amor et Misericordia, in Sensu spirituali Charitas actu quae est Bonum vitae, et in Sensu naturali Consociatio et Conjunctio; dictus etiam est ab Adhaerere, per quod in Verbo significatur conjunctio per amorem: hic autem per "Levim" significatur Amor seu Affectio veri et inde Intelligentia, quia sequitur post Simeonem, et in serie hac est medius. Quoniam Levi illa repraesentabat, ideo tribus illa facta est Sacerdotium, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_357/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_3_1-51" target=_top>Numeri 3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_357/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_21_5" target=_top>Deuteronomius 21:5</a>; et alibi).<p>Quod "Tribus Levi" Amorem veri, qui est ipse amor ex quo Ecclesia est Ecclesia, et inde Intelligentiam, significet, constare potest ex his locis: <p>Filii Levi a Jehovah electi sunt ad ministrandum Ipsi, et ad benedicendum in Nomine Ipsius, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_357/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_21_5" target=_top>Deuteronomius 21:5</a>);<p>"benedicere in Nomine Jehovae" est docere; quod solum illi possunt, qui in affectione veri sunt et inde intelligentia. <p>"Custodiunt Verbum Tuum et foedus Tuum servant, docebunt judicia Tua Jacobum, et legem Tuam Israelem," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_357/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_33_8-11" target=_top>Deuteronomius 33:8-11</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>"Subito veniet ad Templum Suum Dominus, et sedebit purgans et conflans argentum, et purificabit filios Levi, et defecabit eos sicut aurum et argentum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_357/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_malachi_3_1" target=_top>Malachias 3:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_357/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_malachi_3_3" target=_top>3</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>"purificare filios Levi" est illos qui in affectione veri sunt.
