<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第919节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>919.启21:23.“那城不需要日月照耀它，因有神的荣耀光照它，又有羔羊为城的灯”表新教会之人不会处于自我之爱和自己的聪明，因而不会单单处于属世之光，还将处于唯独来自主出于神性真理的属灵之光。“日”在此表示脱离属灵之爱的属世之爱，这爱就是自我之爱；“月”表示脱离属灵的聪明和信仰的属世聪明和信仰，就是自己的聪明和出于自我的信仰。这种爱，以及这种聪明和信仰在此以“日月”来表示，那些将在主的新教会之人不会需要这样的光照。光照它的“神的荣耀”表示圣言的神性真理（<a href="629.htm">629</a>节）；由于光照来自主，故经上说“又有羔羊为城的灯”。以赛亚书中的这些话所表示的事，与此处这些事很相似：</p><p>你必称你的墙为拯救，称你的门为赞美。日头不再作你白昼的光，月亮也不再以光辉发光给你；耶和华却要作你永远的光，你神要为你的荣美！你的日头不再下落，你的月亮也不退缩；因为耶和华必作你永远的光；你的人民都必成为义人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.18.htm">60:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.21.htm">21</a>）</p><p>不再发光的“日头”和“月亮”表示自我之爱和自己的聪明；不再下落的“日头”和“月亮”表示来自主的对主之爱，以及来自主的聪明和信仰。“耶和华要作你永远的光”与此处“神的荣耀光照它，又有羔羊为城的灯”所表相同。“日”表示对主之爱，在反面意义上表示自我之爱（参看<a href="53.htm">53</a>，<a href="144.htm">144</a>节）；“月”表示来自主的聪明，和来自祂的信仰（<a href="332.htm">332</a>，<a href="413.htm">413</a>，<a href="414.htm">414</a>节）。因此，“月”在反面意义上表示自己的聪明和出于自我的信仰。由于“日”在反面意义上表示自我之爱，“月”在反面意义上表示自己的聪明和出于自我的信仰，所以拜日月星辰是可憎的事，这从圣言明显可知（如耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.1.htm">8:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.2.htm">2</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.15.htm">8:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.16.htm">16</a>；西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.5.htm">1:5</a>）；这种人会用石头打死（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.2.htm">17:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.5.htm">5</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 919</h4><p>919. <a href="3927/revelation_21_23.htm">21:23</a> The city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it, and the Lamb is its lamp. This symbolically means that people of the New Church will not be caught up in self-love and their own intelligence and so possess a natural sight only, but from the Word's Divine truth will possess a spiritual light from the Lord alone.<p>The sun here symbolizes natural love divorced from spiritual love, which is self-love. And the moon symbolizes a natural intelligence and faith divorced from a spiritual intelligence and faith, which is one's native intelligence and a self-made faith. This is the love and the intelligence and faith symbolized by the sun and moon here, which people of the Lord's New Church will have no need of to light their sight.<p>The glory of God which illumines the city symbolizes the Word's Divine truth (no. <a href="629.htm">629</a>), and because that illumination or enlightenment comes from the Lord, we are told as well that the Lamb is its lamp.<p>The symbolism here is similar to that found in the following verses in Isaiah:<p>You shall call your walls salvation, and your gates praise. The sun shall no longer be your light by day, nor for brightness shall the moon give light to you; but Jehovah will be to you an everlasting light, and your God your glory. Your sun shall no longer go down, nor shall your moon wane; for Jehovah will be your everlasting light... Your people shall all be righteous. (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_18.htm">Isaiah 60:18-21</a>)<p>The sun and moon that will no longer give light mean self-love and one's native intelligence. And the sun and moon that will no longer go down mean love from the Lord for the Lord, and an intelligence and faith from Him. That Jehovah will be an everlasting light has the same symbolic meaning as what is said here, that the glory of God will illumine the city and the Lamb be its lamp.<p>That the sun symbolizes love for the Lord, and in an opposite sense self-love, may be seen in nos. <a href="53.htm">53</a> and <a href="414.htm">414</a> above. And that the moon symbolizes intelligence from the Lord and faith from Him, in nos. <a href="332.htm">332</a>, <a href="413.htm">413</a>, <a href="414.htm">414</a>. Thus the moon in an opposite sense symbolizes one's native intelligence and a self-made faith.<p>Since the sun in an opposite sense symbolizes self-love, and the moon one's native intelligence and a self-made faith, therefore it was an abomination to worship the sun, moon and stars, as may be seen in <a href="3927/jeremiah_8_1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1-2</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 919</h4><p>919. [verse 23] 'And the city had no need of the sun and the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God has enlightened it, and the lamp thereof is the Lamb' signifies that the men of that Church will not be in the love of self and in self-derived intelligence (in propria intelligentia), and consequently in natural light only, but in spiritual light out of the Divine Truth of the Word from the Only Lord. By 'the sun' here is signified natural love separated from spiritual love, and this is the love of self; and by 'the moon' is signified natural intelligence, also natural faith, separated from spiritual intelligence and faith, and this is self-derived intelligence and faith from self. This love, and this intelligence and faith, are signified here by 'the sun and the moon,' and those who will be in the Lord's New Church will have no need of such shining. By 'the glory of God' that enlightens it is signified the Divine Truth of the Word (<a href="629.htm">629</a>); and because that enlightenment is from the Lord it is said 'and the lamp thereof is the Lamb.' Things similar to those here are signified by these words in Isaiah:<p>Thou shalt call thy walls salvation, and thy gates praise. The sun shall no more be for a light to thee by day, neither for brightness shall the moon give light to thee, but Jehovah shall be to thee for a light of eternity, and thy God for thy grace. Thy sun shall no more set, neither shall thy moon wane; for the Lord shall be to thee for a light of eternity: thy people shall all be just. <a href="3927/isaiah_60_18.htm">Isaiah 60:18-21</a>.<p>By 'the sun and moon' which shall shine no more are understood the love of self and self-derived intelligence; and by 'the sun and moon' which shall no more set are understood love from the Lord directed to the Lord and intelligence, also faith, from Him. And by [the statement] that 'Jehovah shall be for a light of eternity' is signified a similar thing as here, that 'the glory of God has enlightened it, and the lamp thereof is the Lamb.' That 'the sun' signifies love directed to the Lord, and in the opposite sense the love of self, may be seen above (<a href="53.htm">53</a>, <a href="414.htm">414</a>); and that 'the moon' signifies intelligence from the Lord and faith from Him (<a href="332.htm">332</a>, <a href="413.htm">413-414</a>). Consequently 'the moon in the opposite sense signifies self-derived intelligence and faith from self. Since by 'the sun' in the opposite sense is signified the love of self, and by 'the moon' self-derived intelligence and faith from self, therefore it was an abomination to adore the sun, the moon and the stars, as can be established (in <a href="3927/jeremiah_8_1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1-2</a>; in <a href="3927/ezekiel_8_15.htm">Ezekiel 8:15-16</a>; in <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>); and that those [who did so] were stoned (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_17_2.htm">Deuteronomy 17:2-5</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 919</h4><p>919. Verse 23. And the city hath no need of the sun, and the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God did lighten it, and its lamp is the Lamb, signifies that the men of that church will not be in self-love and in their own intelligence, and thence in natural light alone, but in spiritual light from the Divine truth of the Word from the Lord alone. By "the sun" is here signified natural love separated from spiritual love, which is self-love; and by "the moon" is signified intelligence, also natural faith, separated from intelligence and spiritual faith, which is their own intelligence and faith from self; this love, and this intelligence and faith, are here signified by "the sun and moon," the shining of which will not be needed by those who will be in the Lord's New Church. By "the glory of God" which lightens it is signified the Divine truth of the Word, (<a href="629.htm">629</a>[1-2]); and because that enlightenment is from the Lord, it is said "and the lamp thereof is the Lamb." Similar to this is the signification of the following passage in Isaiah:<p>Thou shalt call thy walls salvation, and thy gates praise. The sun shall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee; but Jehovah shall be unto thee for a light of eternity, and thy God thy adornment; thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself; for Jehovah shall be to thee for a light of eternity; thy people also shall be all just, (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_18.htm">Isaiah 60:18-21</a>).<p>By "the sun and moon" which shall no more shine is meant self-love and their own intelligence; and by "the sun and moon" which shall no more set, are meant love from the Lord to the Lord, and intelligence and faith from Him; and by "Jehovah shall be for a light of eternity" is signified the same as here, "that the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof." That "the sun" signifies love to the Lord, and in the opposite sense self-love, may be seen above, (<a href="53.htm">53</a>, <a href="414.htm">414</a>); and that "the moon" signifies intelligence from the Lord and faith from Him, (<a href="332.htm">332</a>, <a href="413.htm">413-414</a>), therefore "the moon" in the opposite sense signifies their own intelligence and faith from themselves. Since by "the sun" in the opposite sense is signified self-love, and by "the moon" one's own intelligence and faith from himself, therefore it was an abomination to adore the sun, moon, and stars, as may appear (in <a href="3927/jeremiah_8_1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1-2</a>; in <a href="3927/ezekiel_8_15.htm">Ezekiel 8:15-16</a> in <a href="3927/zephaniah_1_5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>); and that such were stoned, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_17_2.htm">Deuteronomy 17:2-3</a>, <a href="3927/deuteronomy_17_5.htm">5</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 919 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>919. (Vers. 23.) "Et urbs non opus habet sole et luna ut luceant in ea, quia Gloria Dei illustravit eam, et Lucerna ejus Agnus," significat quod homines illius Ecclesiae non erunt in amore sui et in propria intelligentia, et inde in lumine solo naturali, sed ex Divino Vero Verbi a Solo Domino in luce spirituali. - Per "solem" hic significatur amor naturalis separatus ab amore spirituali, qui est amor sui; et per "lunam" significatur intelligentia, tum fides naturalis, separata ab intelligentia et fide spirituali, quae est propria intelligentia et fides a se; hic amor et haec intelligentia et fides significantur hic per "solem et lunam," quibus non opus habebunt ut luceant coram illis qui in Nova Domini Ecclesia erunt: per "Gloriam Dei," quae illustrat illam, significatur Divinum Verum Verbi (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_919/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_629" target=_top>629</a>); et quia a Domino est illustratio illa, dicitur "et lucerna ejus Agnus." Similia quae hic, significantur per haec apud Esajam: <p>"Vocabis salutem muros tuos, et portas tuas laudem; non erit tibi amplius sol in lucem interdiu, et in splendorem luna non lucebit tibi; sed erit tibi Jehovah in lucem aeternitatis, e Deus tuus in decus tuum: non occidet amplius Sol tuus, et Luna tua non colligetur, quia Jehovah erit ibi in Lucem aeternitatis; populus tuus omnes justi," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_919/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_60_18-21" target=_top>60:18-21</a>);<p>per "solem et lunam" quae non amplius lucebunt, intelliguntur amor sui et propria intelligentia; et per "solem et lunam" quae non amplius occident, intelliguntur amor a Domino in Dominum, ac intelligentia tum fides ab Ipso; et per quod "Jehovah erit in lucem aeternitatis" significatur simile quod hic, quod "Gloria Dei illustrabit, et lucerna ejus Agnus." Quod "sol" significet amorem in Dominum, et in opposito sensu amorem sui, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_919/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_53" target=_top>53</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_919/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_414" target=_top>414</a>); et quod "luna" significet intelligentiam a Domino et fidem ab Ipso (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_919/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_332" target=_top>332</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_919/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_413" target=_top>413</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_919/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_414" target=_top>414</a>); inde "luna" in opposito sensu significat propriam intelligentiam et fidem a se. Quoniam per "solem" in opposito sensu significatur amor sui, et per "lunam" propria intelligentia et fides a se, ideo Abominatio fuit adorare ad solem, lunam et stellas (ut constare potest apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_919/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_8_1-2" target=_top>Jeremias 8:1-2</a>; apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_919/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_8_15-16" target=_top>Ezechiel 8:15-16</a>; apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_919/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zephaniah_1_5" target=_top>Zephanias 1:5</a>);<p>Et quod illi lapidarentur, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_919/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_17_2-3" target=_top>Deuteronomius 17:2-3</a>(, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_919/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_17_5" target=_top>5</a>)). </p>
