<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>331.“见有大地震”表教会的状态在这些人当中完全改变，以及恐惧。“地震”表示教会状态的改变，因为“地”表示教会（<a href="285.htm">285</a>节）；由于在灵界，无论在何处，当教会的状态堕落，发生改变时，就会看到地震，并且由于这预示着他们的毁灭，所以便有恐惧产生。因为灵界的“陆地”看上去如同自然界的陆地（<a href="260.htm">260</a>节）；不过，由于和灵界的所有其它事物一样，那里的陆地也是出于一个属灵的源头，所以它们照着其上居民当中教会的状态而发生相应变化；当教会的状态堕落时，它们就会震动发抖，甚至下沦，离其本位。当最后审判即将发生或正在发生时，这一切便会发生。这一事实可见于《最后的审判》这本小册子。由此明显可知在以下经文中，“地震”、“震动”、“摇撼”或“战抖”是什么意思：</p><p>多处必有瘟疫、饥荒和地震。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.7.htm">24:7</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.8.htm">13:8</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.11.htm">21:11</a>）</p><p>这论及最后的审判。</p><p>我发愤恨如火说，那日必有大地震，地面上各人都震动，诸山必倾覆。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.18.htm">38:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.20.htm">20</a>）</p><p>有大地震，自从地上有人以来没有这样的地震。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.18.htm">16:18</a>）</p><p>在万军之耶和华发怒的日子，我必使天震动，地也离其本位。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.13.htm">13:13</a>）</p><p>地的根基也震动了，地大大震动，其罪过在它上头沉重。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.18.htm">24:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.20.htm">20</a>）</p><p>因祂发怒，地就摇撼战抖，山的根基也震动摇撼。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.7.htm">18:7</a>）</p><p>大山在耶和华面前震动，磐石也倾覆。（那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿1.5.htm">1:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿1.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>还有其它地方（如耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.10.htm">10:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.21.htm">49:21</a>；约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.10.htm">2:10</a>；哈该书<a href="http://39-27.cn/该2.6.htm">2:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/该2.7.htm">7</a>；启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.19.htm">11:19</a>等）。不过，要明白，这些事发生在灵界，而非自然界；它们在这方面表示诸如前面所解释的那类事物。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 331</h4><p>331. And behold, there was a great earthquake. This symbolizes the state of the church among those people completely changed, and their terror.<p>Earthquakes symbolize changes in the state of the church because the earth symbolizes the church (no. <a href="285.htm">285</a>), and because in the spiritual world, when the state of the church is corrupted somewhere and a change is made, an earthquake occurs. And because this presages the people's destruction, they are in terror. For lands in the spiritual world are in appearance like lands in the natural world (no. <a href="260.htm">260</a>). But because lands there, like everything else in that world, have a spiritual origin, therefore those lands change in accordance with the state of the church among the inhabitants upon them, and when the state of the church is corrupted, the lands tremble and quake, even sinking down and being moved from their location.<p>That this is what happened when the Last Judgment was imminent and taking place may be seen in the short work, The Last Judgment.<p>It can be seen from this what quakes, shakings and removals of the earth symbolize in the following places:<p>...there will be pestilences, famines, and earthquakes in various places. (<a href="3927/matthew_24_7.htm">Matthew 24:7</a>, cf. <a href="3927/mark_13_8.htm">Mark 13:8</a>, <a href="3927/luke_21_11.htm">Luke 21:11</a>)<p>(These things are said there of the Last Judgment.)<p>...in the fire of My wrath I have spoken, if in that day there is not a great earthquake... so that... every person on the face of the earth shakes... and the mountains are overthrown... (<a href="3927/ezekiel_38_18.htm">Ezekiel 38:18-20</a>).<p>...there was a great earthquake, such as had not occurred since people came on the earth. (<a href="3927/revelation_16_18.htm">Revelation 16:18</a>)<p>...I will shake the heavens, and the earth will be moved out of her place, in the wrath of Jehovah of hosts... (<a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>)<p>...the foundations of the earth are shaken... The earth is shaken exceedingly...(because) its transgression is heavy upon it... (<a href="3927/isaiah_24_18.htm">Isaiah 24:18-20</a>)<p>The earth shook and quaked, and the foundations of the hills..., because He was angry. (<a href="3927/psalms_18_7.htm">Psalms 18:7</a>)<p>The mountains quake before (Jehovah)...and the rocks are overthrown... (<a href="3927/nahum_1_5.htm">Nahum 1:5-6</a>)<p>So likewise in other places, as in <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_49_21.htm">49:21</a>, <a href="3927/joel_2_10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>, <a href="3927/haggai_2_6.htm">Haggai 2:6-7</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_11_19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>, and elsewhere.<p>These things, however, must be understood as taking place in the spiritual world, and not in the natural world. In the natural world they symbolize such things as stated above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 331</h4><p>331. 'And behold a great earthquake was brought about' signifies the state of the Church with those entirely changed, and terror. 'Earthquakes' signify changes of state in the Church, because 'land' [or 'earth'] (terra) signifies the Church (<a href="285.htm">285</a>); and because in the spiritual world, when the state of the Church is corrupted anywhere and there is a change, an earthquake is seen, and because this foretells their destruction, terror is produced. For the lands in the spiritual world are in appearance like the lands in the natural world (<a href="260.htm">260</a>); but because the lands there, just as all the other things in that world, are out of a spiritual origin, they are changed in accordance with the state of the Church of the inhabitants upon them, and when the state of the Church is corrupted, they quake and tremble, even sink down and are moved out of place. That it so happened when the last judgment was impending and taking place can be seen in the little work concerning THE LAST JUDGMENT. From these things it can be established what is signified by 'earthquakes,' 'tremors,' and 'movements' in the following passages:<p>There shall be pestilences, famines, earthquakes in divers places. <a href="3927/matthew_24_7.htm">Matthew 24:7</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_8.htm">Mark 13:8</a>; <a href="3927/luke_21_11.htm">Luke 21:11</a>.<p>Those things are said of the last judgment.<p>In the fire of indignation will I speak if in that day there is not a great earthquake, so that every man upon the faces of the land shall tremble, and the mountains shall be overturned. <a href="3927/ezekiel_38_18.htm">Ezekiel 38:18-20</a>.<p>There was a great earthquake, such as was not since there came to be men upon earth. <a href="3927/revelation_16_18.htm">Revelation 16:18</a>.<p>I will shake heaven, and the land shall be shaken out of its place, in the indignation of Jehovah Zebaoth. <a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>.<p>The foundations of the land have been shaken violently; shaking, the land has been shaken, for the transgression thereof is heavy upon it. <a href="3927/isaiah_24_18.htm">Isaiah 24:18-20</a>.<p>Violently shaken and shaken is the land, and the foundations of the mountains, because He was wroth. <a href="3927/psalms_18_7.htm">Psalms 18:7</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_18_14.htm">14</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_18_8.htm">8</a>, <a href="3927/psalms_18_15.htm">15</a>].<p>The mountains tremble before Jehovah, and the rocks are overturned. <a href="3927/nahum_1_5.htm">Nahum 1:5-6</a>.<p>Likewise in other places, as <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_49_21.htm">49:21</a>; <a href="3927/joel_2_10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="3927/haggai_2_6.htm">Haggai 2:6-7</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_11_19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>, and elsewhere. These things, however, are to be understood as being done in the spiritual world but not in the natural world. In this respect they signify such things as have been stated above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 331</h4><p>331. And, behold, there was a great earthquake, signifies the state of the church with these altogether changed, and terror. "Earthquakes" signify changes of state in the church, because "the earth" signifies the church, (<a href="285.htm">285</a>); and because in the spiritual world, when the state of the church is perverted anywhere, and there is a change, there is an earthquake, and as this is a prelude to their destruction, they are in terror. For the earths in the spiritual world are in appearance like the earths in the natural world, (<a href="260.htm">260</a>); but as the earths there, like all other things in that world, are from a spiritual origin, therefore changes occur according to the state of the church among the inhabitants, and when the state of the church is perverted, they quake and tremble, yea, sink down and are moved out of their place. That this was the case, when the Last Judgment was at hand and accomplished, may be seen in the small work on The Last Judgment. Hence it may appear what is meant by "earthquakes," "shakings," and "commotions" of the earth, in the following passages:<p>There shall be pestilences, famines, and earthquakes in diverse places, (<a href="3927/matthew_24_7.htm">Matthew 24:7</a>; <a href="3927/mark_13_8.htm">Mark 13:8</a>; <a href="3927/luke_21_11.htm">Luke 21:11</a>).<p>This is said of the Last Judgment:<p>In the fire of indignation have I spoken; surely in that day there shall be a great earthquake, and every man upon the face of the earth shall tremble, and the mountains shall be overturned, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_38_19.htm">Ezekiel 38:19-20</a>).<p>There was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, (<a href="3927/revelation_16_18.htm">Revelation 16:18</a>).<p>I will shake heaven, and the earth shall be removed out of her place in the indignation of Jehovah of Hosts, (<a href="3927/isaiah_13_13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>).<p>And the foundations of the earth have been shaken, the earth is moved exceedingly, for the transgression thereof is heavy upon it, (<a href="3927/isaiah_24_18.htm">Isaiah 24:18-20</a>).<p>The earth is shaken and moved, and the foundations of the mountains, because He was wroth, (<a href="3927/psalms_18_7.htm">Psalms 18:7</a>).<p>The mountains tremble before Jehovah, and the rocks are overturned (<a href="3927/nahum_1_1.htm">Nahum 1</a> and so in other places; as <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_49_21.htm">49:21</a>; <a href="3927/joel_2_10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="3927/haggai_2_6.htm">Haggai 2:6-7</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_11_19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>; and elsewhere).<p>But these things are to be understood as being done in the spiritual world, but not in the natural world; in this respect they signify such things as are explained above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 331 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>331. "Et ecce terrae motus magnus factus est," significat statum Ecclesiae apud illos prorsus immutatum, et terrorem. -Quod "terrae motus" significent status mutationes in Ecclesia, est quia "terra" significat Ecclesiam (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_331/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_285" target=_top>285</a>) et quia in mundo spirituali, dum alicubi pervertitur status Ecclesiae, et fit mutatio, existit terrae motus, et quia hic praenuntiat interitum illorum, fit terror. Terrae enim in mundo spirituali sunt quoad faciem similes terris in mundo naturali (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_331/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_260" target=_top>260</a>); sed quia terrae ibi, sicut omnia alia in illo mundo, sunt ex origine spirituali, ideo secundum statum Ecclesiae habitatorum super illis mutantur, et dum pervertitur status Ecclesiae, commoventur et tremiscunt, imo subsidunt et emoventur loco: quod ita factum sit cum Ultimum Judicium instabat et fiebat, videri potest in Opusculo de Ultimo Judicio.
