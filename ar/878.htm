<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>878.“海也不再有了”表由最初建立教会以来的基督徒所组成的天堂外在同样被驱散，不过这要等到那些写在主生命册上的人从那里被接出去，并得救之后。“海”表示天堂和教会的外在，对教会之事的思维属世、极少属灵的简单人就处于这外在。这些人所在的天堂被称为外在的（参看<a href="238.htm">238</a>，<a href="398.htm">398</a>末尾，<a href="403.htm">403</a>，<a href="404.htm">404</a>，<a href="466.htm">466</a>，<a href="470.htm">470</a>，<a href="659.htm">659</a>，<a href="661.htm">661</a>节）。此处“海”表示由最初建立教会以来的基督徒所组成的天堂外在。但主还没有完全形成由基督徒所组成的天堂内在，直到最后审判前的某个时间点，以及最后审判之后，这一点从相关章节（｛14-｛15章，以及<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.4.htm">20:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.5.htm">5</a>）的解读明显可知。天堂的内在之所以没有很快形成，是因为龙及其两个兽在灵人界占据统治地位，并且欲火中烧、极尽所能地迷惑每个人，因此将简单人过早地聚集到任何天堂都是非常危险的。善者与龙们的分离，以及龙们被诅咒，最后被扔进地狱在多处有所论述，最后在19:20和20:10被论述；之后经上说“海交出其中的死人（｛20:13），以此表示被召集起来受审判的教会外在和属世之人（参看<a href="869.htm">869</a>节），和当时那些写在主生命册上的人的分离和得救，对此，可参看这一节。</p><p>这就是此处所指的“海”。在论述新基督天堂时，别处也提及海，经上说它延伸到“有火搀杂的玻璃海”（｛15:2）。这“海”也表示由基督徒所组成的天堂的外在（<a href="659.htm">659</a>-661节）。由此明显可知，“海也不再有了”表示由最初建立教会以来的基督徒所组成的天堂外在同样被驱散，不过这要等到那些写在主生命册上的人从那里被接出去，并得救之后。关于由最初建立教会以来的基督徒所组成的天堂外在，我蒙恩得以知道许多事，但在此没有时间宣布；仅说明，在最后审判之日过去的先前的天，被允许存在，是为了那些身处外在天堂或海之人，因为他们凭外在途径，而非内在被结合，关于该主题的相关内容，可参看前文（<a href="398.htm">398</a>节）。教会的外在人所在的天堂之所以被称为“海”，是因为他们在灵界的所居之地从远处看，就像在海中；事实上，属天天使，也就是最高层天堂的天使仿佛住在以太层；属灵天使，也就是中间天堂的天使，仿佛住在空气层；而属世天使，也就是最低层天堂的天使，仿佛住在水气层，从远处看，就像海，如前所述。这就是为何在圣言的其它许多地方，天堂的外在也由“海”来表示。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 878</h4><p>878. And there was no more sea. This symbolically means that the outer part of the heaven composed of Christians since the church was first established was likewise dispersed, after those who were written in the Lord's Book of Life were liberated from there and saved.<p>A sea symbolizes the external component of heaven and the church, where the simple are, who think naturally and not much spiritually about matters connected with the church. A heaven inhabited by these is called external, as may be seen in nos. <a href="238.htm">238</a>, <a href="398.htm">398</a> at the end, <a href="403.htm">403</a>, <a href="404.htm">404</a>, <a href="470.htm">470</a>, <a href="567.htm">567</a>, <a href="659.htm">659</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>. Here the sea means the outer part of the heaven composed of Christians from the first establishment of the church. However, the inner part of the heaven of Christians was not fully formed by the Lord until shortly before the Last Judgment, and also after it, as may be seen from chapters <a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">14</a> and <a href="3927/revelation_15_1.htm">15</a>, which have that heaven as their subject, and from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">20:4</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_5.htm">5</a>, too. See the exposition in those places.<p>The inner part of that heaven was not fully formed sooner because the dragon and its two beasts held sway in the world of spirits, and they burned with a desire to lead astray whomever they could. It would have been dangerous, therefore, to gather together those Christians into a heaven beforehand.<p>The separation of the good from adherents of the dragon and the damnation of the latter, followed by their finally being cast down into hell, is the subject in many places, and lastly in chapter <a href="3927/revelation_19_20.htm">19:20</a>, and chapter <a href="3927/revelation_20_10.htm">20:10</a>. And after that we are told that "the sea gave up the dead who were in it" (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_20_13.htm">20:13</a>), which means that the external and natural people of the church were called together for judgment, as may be seen in no. <a href="869.htm">869</a> above, and that those who were written in the Lord's Book of Life were then liberated and saved, as indicated also in the same number. This is the sea that is meant here.</p><p>[2] We are also told elsewhere regarding the New Christian Heaven that the outer part of the heaven of Christians extended to a sea of glass mixed with fire (<a href="3927/revelation_15_2.htm">Revelation 15:2</a>), and the sea there also symbolizes the outer part of the heaven of Christians. See the exposition in nos. <a href="659.htm">659-661</a>.<p>It can be seen from this that there being no more sea means, symbolically, that the outer part of the heaven composed of Christians since the church was first established was likewise dispersed, after those who were written in the Lord's Book of Life were liberated from there and saved.<p>Regarding the outer part of the heaven composed of Christians from the first establishment of the church, I have been granted to learn many things - too many, however, to present them here. I will say only that the previous heavens which passed away at the time of the Last Judgment were permitted for the sake of those Christians who were in that outer part of heaven or sea, because they were conjoined by external concerns and not by internal ones - on which subject something may be seen in no. <a href="398.htm">398</a> above.<p>The heaven where external people of the church dwell is called a sea because their dwelling place in the spiritual world appears from a distance as being in a sea. For celestial angels, or angels of the highest heaven, dwell as though in an ethereal atmosphere. Spiritual angels, or angels of the intermediate heaven, dwell as though in an airy atmosphere. And spiritually natural angels, or angels of the lowest heaven, dwell as though in a watery atmosphere, which, as we said, from a distance looks like a sea.<p>For this reason the outer part of heaven is meant by the sea also in many other places in the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 878</h4><p>878. 'And the sea was no more' signifies the external of the heaven composed of Christians since the first establishment of the Church likewise having been done away with, after those who were written in the Lord's book of life were taken out of it and saved. By 'the sea' is signified the external of heaven and the Church, in which are the simple who have thought naturally but little spiritually about the things of the Church. The heaven in which these are is called external, as may be seen (<a href="238.htm">238</a>, <a href="398.htm">398</a>, <a href="403.htm">403-404</a>, <a href="466.htm">466</a>, <a href="470.htm">470</a>, <a href="659.htm">659</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>). Here by 'the sea' is understood the external of the heaven composed of Christians since the first establishment of the Church. But the internal of the heaven of Christians was not fully formed by the Lord until some time before the last judgment, and also after it, as can be established from chapters <a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">14</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_15_1.htm">15</a>, where it is treated of, and from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">20:4-5</a>. The expositions may be seen. The reason why it was not sooner was because the dragon and his two beasts were exercising dominion in the world of spirits and were burning with the lust of leading astray everyone they could, and therefore to gather the simple into any heaven was [attended with] risk. The separation of the good from the dragonists, and the damnation of the latter, and at length the casting down into hell, is treated of in many places, and lastly in chapter <a href="3927/revelation_19_20.htm">19:20</a> and in chapter <a href="3927/revelation_20_10.htm">20:10</a>; and after this it is said that 'the sea gave up the dead in it' (verse 13), by which is understood the external and natural men of the Church called together to judgment, as may be seen above (<a href="869.htm">869</a>), and those who were written in the Lord's book of life being taken out and saved then, this subject being treated of there.</p><p>[2] This is 'the sea' that is understood here. It is also said elsewhere, in treating of the Christian New Heaven, that it extended to 'the sea of glass mingled with fire' (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_15_2.htm">15:2</a>). By this 'sea' also the external of the heaven [composed] of Christians is signified. Let the exposition be seen (<a href="659.htm">659-661</a>). From these things it can be established that by 'the sea was no more is signified that the external of the heaven composed of Christians since the first establishment of the Church was likewise done away with, after those who were written in the Lord's book of life were taken out and saved. Concerning the external of the heaven composed of Christians since the first establishment of the Church it has been granted [me] to know many things, but there is not time to announce them here; only that the former heavens, which passed away at the day of the last judgment, were permitted for the sake of those who were in that external heaven or sea because they were conjoined by external means but not by internal, on which subject something may be seen above (<a href="398.htm">398</a>). The reason why the heaven where the external men of the Church are is termed 'the sea' is because their dwelling-place in the spiritual world appears from afar off as if in the sea; for celestial angels, who are the angels of the highest heaven, dwell as it were in an ethereal atmosphere; spiritual angels, who are the angels of the middle heaven, dwell as it were in an airy atmosphere; and natural angels, who are the angels of the lowest heaven, dwell as it were in a watery atmosphere, which from afar off appears as the sea, as was said. This is why the external of heaven is understood by 'the sea' in many other places in the Word also. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 878</h4><p>878. And the sea was no more, signifies that the external of the heaven collected from among Christians, since the first establishment of the church, was in like manner dispersed, after they who were written in the Lord's book of life were taken thence and saved. By "the sea" is signified the external of heaven and of the church, in which are the simple, who have thought naturally and but little spiritually of things relating to the church; the heaven in which these are is called external (see <a href="238.htm">238</a>, <a href="239.htm">239</a>, <a href="403.htm">403</a>, <a href="404.htm">404</a>, <a href="420.htm">420</a>, <a href="466.htm">466</a>, <a href="470.htm">470</a>, <a href="659.htm">659</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>); by "the sea" here is meant the external of heaven collected from among Christians from the first establishment of the church. But the internal heaven of Christians was not fully formed by the Lord, till a little before the Last Judgment, and also after it, as may appear from chapters <a href="3927/revelation_14_1.htm">14</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_15_1.htm">15</a>, where it is treated of, and from chapter <a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">20:4-5</a>; see the explanations of which. The reason why this was not done before was because the dragon and his two beasts had dominion in the world of spirits and burned with the lust of seducing everyone they could, wherefore it was hazardous to collect them sooner into a heaven.</p><p>[2] The separation of the good from the dragonists, and the condemnation of the latter, and finally the casting of them into hell, are treated of in many places, and lastly in chapters <a href="3927/revelation_19_20.htm">19:20</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_10.htm">20:10</a>; and after this it is said, that "the sea gave up the dead which were in it" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_21_13.htm">13</a>), by which are meant the external and natural men of the church called to judgment (see above, <a href="869.htm">869</a>), and then the separating and saving of those who were written in the Lord's book of life, concerning which see the same article; this is "the sea" which is here meant. It is also said in another place, where the New Heaven of Christians is treated of, that it extended itself to "the sea of glass mingled with fire" (<a href="3927/revelation_15_2.htm">Revelation 15:2</a>); by which "sea" is also signified the external of the heaven of Christians the explanation, <a href="659.htm">659</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>). From these things it may appear that by "the sea was no more" is signified that the external of heaven collected from among Christians from the first establishment of the church, after they were taken thence and saved who were written in the Lord's book of life, was in like manner dispersed. Concerning the external of heaven collected from among Christians from the first establishment of the church, it has been granted me to know many particulars which it would be tedious to adduce in this place; save only that the former heavens, which passed away at the day of the Last Judgment, were permitted for the sake of those who were in that external heaven or sea, because they were conjoined by externals but not by internals, on which subject something may be seen above, (<a href="398.htm">398</a>). The reason why the heaven, where the men of the external church are, is called "the sea" is because their habitation in the spiritual world appears at a distance as if it were in the sea; for the celestial angels, who are angels of the highest heaven, dwell as it were in an ethereal atmosphere; the spiritual angels, who are angels of the middle heaven, dwell as it were in an aerial atmosphere; and the spiritual natural angels, who are angels of the lowest heaven, dwell as it were in a watery atmosphere, which, as was said, appears at a distance like the sea. Hence it is that the external of heaven is meant by "the sea" in many other places also in the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 878 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>878. "Et Mare non erat amplius," significat externum Caeli a prima Ecclesiae instauratione collecti ex Christianis, postquam inde exempti sunt et salvati qui in Libro vitae Domini scripti sunt, similiter dissipatum esse. - Per "mare" significatur externum Caeli et Ecclesiae, in quo sunt simplices, qui de rebus Ecclesiae naturaliter et perparum spiritualiter cogitaverunt; Caelum in quo hi sunt vocatur externum (videatur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_238" target=_top>238</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_239" target=_top>239</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_403" target=_top>403</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_404" target=_top>404</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_420" target=_top>420</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_466" target=_top>466</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_470" target=_top>470</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_659" target=_top>659</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_661" target=_top>661</a>); hic per "mare" intelligitur externum Caeli a prima Ecclesiae instauratione collecti ex Christianis. Internum autem Caeli ex Christianis non prius a Domino plene formatum est, quam aliquo tempore ante Ultimum Judicium, et quoque post illud (ut constare potest ex <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_14_1-20" target=_top>14</a> et <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_15_1-8" target=_top>15</a>, ubi de illo agitur; et ex <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_4-5" target=_top>20:4-5</a>; videantur Explicationes). Causa quod non prius, erat, quia Draco et binae ejus Bestiae dominabantur in Mundo spirituum, et flagrabant cupiditate seducendi quoscunque possent; quare periculum fuit prius colligere illos in aliquod Caelum. De separatione bonorum a Draconicis, et horum damnatione, et tandem dejectione in Infernum, agitur multis in locis, ac ultimo in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_19_20" target=_top>19:20</a>, et in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_10" target=_top>20:10</a>; et post hoc dicitur, quod "Mare dederit eos in illo mortuos," (vers. 13); per quod intelliguntur homines Ecclesiae externi et naturales convocati ad judicium (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_869" target=_top>869</a>), et tunc exempti et salvati qui in Libro vitae Domini scripti sunt (de qua re etiam ibi); hoc "mare" est quod hic intelligitur. Etiam alibi dicitur, ubi de Novo Caelo Christiano, quod id se extenderit ad "mare vitreum mixtum igne," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_15_2" target=_top>15:2</a>), per quod "mare" etiam significatur externum Caeli ex Christianis (videatur Explicatio, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_659" target=_top>659-661</a>). Ex his constare potest, quod per "mare non erat amplius" significetur quod externum Caeli a prima Ecclesiae instauratione collecti ex Christianis, postquam inde exempti sunt et salvati qui in Libro vitae Domini scripti sunt, similiter dissipatum sit. De externo Caeli ex Christianis a prima instauratione Ecclesiae collecto, multa scire datum est, sed illa hic afferre non vacat; solum quod priores Caeli, qui die Ultimi Judicii transiverunt, permissi fuerint propter illos qui in externo illo Caelo seu mari erant, quia per externa conjuncti erant, non autem per interna; de qua re videantur aliqua supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_878/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_398" target=_top>398</a>). Quod Caelum ubi externi Ecclesiae homines sunt, dicatur "mare," est quia habitatio eorum in mundo spirituali e longinquo apparet sicut in mari; angeli enim caelestes, qui sunt angeli supremi Caeli, habitant sicut in atmosphaera aetherea; angeli spirituales, qui sunt angeli medii Caeli, habitant sicut in atmosphaera aerea; et angeli spirituales naturales, qui sunt angeli ultimi Caeli, habitant sicut in atmosphaera aquea, quae e longinquo apparet sicut mare, ut dictum est: inde est, quod externum Caeli intelligatur per "mare" etiam multis aliis in locis in Verbo. </p>
