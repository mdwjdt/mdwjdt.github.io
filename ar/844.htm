<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第844节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>844.“等到那一千年完了，以后必须暂时释放他”表这些事需要一段时间，或相当长的时间，直到那些处于源自良善的真理之人被主接升天堂；此后，“龙”所指的那些人就会被暂时释放，他们与其余的人之间的联系也会被打开。“等到那一千年完了”表示经过一段时间，或相当长的时间。这是因为“一千年”并非表示一千年，而是表示经过一段时间，或相当长的时间（<a href="842.htm">842</a>节）。“以后必须暂时释放他”表示此后，（前面所论述的）“龙”所指的那些人要从关押中被释放，然后他们与其余的人之间的联系要被打开。所表示的是这些事，这一点可在灵义上从前面所说的事，因而从一系列事情的发展，以及与接下来所发生之事的关联明显看出来。接下来的4-6节经文就论述了那些被主接升天堂的人，“龙”就是因为他们的缘故而被移除并关起来。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 844</h4><p>844. Till the thousand years were completed. But after that it must be released for a little while. This symbolically means that this was the case for a while or for a period of time until people with truths springing from goodness were raised by the Lord into heaven, after which those meant by the dragon would for a short time be set loose and have a communication opened with those who were left.<p>Till the thousand years were completed means, symbolically, for a while or for a period of time, because the thousand years does not mean a thousand years, but a while or a period of time, as in no. <a href="842.htm">842</a> above. That the dragon must be released for a little while means, symbolically, that the people here meant by the dragon, described above, must be afterward set loose from their prison and have a communication opened then with the people who were left. That this is the symbolic meaning is apparent from what has been said before, thus from the context, and from its connection with what follows after this in the spiritual sense.<p>The subject that follows now in verses <a href="3927/revelation_20_4.htm">4-6</a> is people raised by the Lord into heaven, for whose sake the dragon was removed and shut away. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 844</h4><p>844. 'Until the thousand years were finished, and after that he must be let loose for a short time' signifies these things for a while or for a considerable time, until those who were in truths derived from good were taken up into heaven by the Lord; after which those who are understood by 'the dragon' are to be let loose for a short time and a communication between them and the rest opened.<p>By 'until the thousand years were finished' is signified for a while or for a considerable time. This is because by 'the thousand years' is not signified a thousand years but for a while and for a considerable time, as above (<a href="842.htm">842</a>). By its being necessary for him to be loosed for a short time is signified that after this those who are understood by 'the dragon' (treated of above) are to be released from their confinement, and then communication is to be opened between them and the rest. That these things are signified is plain from the things said above, thus from the series of the things, and from the connection with the things following in the spiritual sense. In the things now following from verses 4-6 [the Word] treats of those who were taken up into heaven by the Lord, on whose account the dragon was removed and shut up. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 844</h4><p>844. Until a thousand years were finished, and after that he must be loosed a little time, signifies that this is for a while or for some time, until they are taken up by the Lord into heaven who were in truths from good; after which they who are meant by "the dragon" were to be loosed for a short time, and a communication opened between them and the rest. The reason why "until a thousand years were finished" signifies for awhile or for some time, is because by "a thousand years" are not signified a thousand years, but a little while or some time, as above, (<a href="842.htm">842</a>). "He must be loosed a little, "signifies that after that they who are here meant by "the dragon," as above, are to be released from their confinement, and that then a communication is to be opened between them and the rest; that this is what is signified, is evident from what has been said above, thus from the series of things, and from their connection with what follows, in the spiritual sense. What now follows (from vers. 4-6) treats of those who were taken up by the Lord into heaven, on whose account the dragon was removed and shut up. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 844 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>844. "Donec consummarentur mille anni, et post haec oportet eum solvi exiguum tempus," significat quod haec aliquamdiu seu aliquanto tempore, usque dum a Domino sublati sunt in Caelum qui in veris ex bono erant; post quod illi qui per "Draconem" intelliguntur, brevi tempore solvendi sint, et illis aperienda communicatio cum reliquis. -Quod per "donec consummarentur mille anni" significetur aliquamdiu seu aliquanto tempore, est quia per "mille annos" non significantur mille anni, sed aliquamdiu et aliquanto tempore, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_844/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_842" target=_top>842</a>); per "oportet eum solvi exiguum tempus" significatur quod post id illi qui per "Draconem" hic intelliguntur, de quibus supra, e custodia sua solvendi sint, et tunc illis aperienda communicatio cum reliquis; quod haec significentur, patet a supradictis, ita a serie rerum, et a connexione cum sequentibus in Sensu spirituali. Agitur in nunc sequentibus (a vers. 4 ad 6) de illis qui a Domino sublati sunt in Caelum, propter quos Draco remotus et conclusus est. </p>
