<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第552节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>552.“他被摔在地上，他的使者也同他被摔下去”表他被摔在灵人界，灵人界在天堂与地狱的中间，与地上的人直接结合就是通过灵人界。</p><p>经上说龙被摔所在的“地”之所以表示灵人界，是因为灵人界就在诸天堂的正下方，人若从天上被摔下来，不是直接掉进地狱，而是摔在天堂正下方灵人界的地上，因为灵人界在天堂与地狱的中间，在诸天堂之下、众地狱之上。关于灵人界的许多事，可参看1758年于伦敦出版的《天堂与地狱》（<a href="../hh/421.htm">421</a>-535节）一书。所有在灵人界者都与地上的人直接相联；所以，龙及其使者与那些因接受唯信这个异端而陷入虚假，并由此陷入邪恶的人相联；由于这个原因，下面经上说：</p><p>所以诸天和住在其中的，你们都快乐吧。只是住在地与海上的有祸了，因为魔鬼知道自己的时候不多，就大大发怒下到你们那里去了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.12.htm">12:12</a>）</p><p>还有：</p><p>他将妇人追到旷野，去与她其余的种争战。（启示录12: 13-17）</p><p>要知道，就其情感和由此而来的思维而言，每个人都与灵人界中的那些灵人同在某个社群，并通过他们间接与要么在天堂，要么在地狱者联结。每个人的生命都取决于这种联结。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 552</h4><p>552. It was cast to the earth, and its angels were cast out with it. This symbolically means that they were cast into the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, from which a direct conjunction is formed with people on earth.<p>The earth to which the dragon is said to have been cast means the world of spirits, because this world lies directly under the heavens, and when anyone is cast out of heaven, he does not sink immediately into hell, but onto the land in this world that is the nearest one beneath. For this world is midway between heaven and hell, being situated below the heavens and above the hells. More on this world may be seen in the book Heaven and Hell (London, 1758), nos. <a href="../hh/421.htm">421-535</a>.<p>The people in this world all communicate directly with people on earth. The dragon and its angels consequently communicate with people caught up in falsities and their accompanying evils, owing to the heresy they have accepted regarding faith alone. The text accordingly says later in verse <a href="3927/revelation_12_12.htm">12</a> of this chapter,<p>Therefore rejoice, O heavens...! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has a short time." (<a href="3927/revelation_12_12.htm">Revelation 12:12</a>)<p>We are also told in verses <a href="3927/revelation_12_13.htm">13-17</a> that the dragon pursued the woman into the wilderness, and went off to make war with the rest of her offspring.<p>It should be known that in respect to his affections and consequent thoughts, everyone is present in a society with people in the world of spirits, and indirectly through them with people either in heaven or in hell. Everyone's life depends on that conjunction. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 552</h4><p>552. 'Was cast out into the land, and his angels were cast out with him' signifies that [they are cast] into the world of spirits, which is intermediate between heaven and hell, and from which there is a direct conjunction with the men of the earth. By 'the land' into which the dragon is said to have been cast out is understood the world of spirits. This is because that world lies directly under the heavens, and when anyone is cast down out of heaven, he does not there and then fall into hell, but into the land of this world next below. For that world is intermediate between heaven and hell, or below the heavens and above the hells. Many things concerning that world may be seen in the work concerning HEAVEN AND HELL, published at London in the year 1758 (<a href="421.htm">421-535</a>). All those who are in that world communicate directly with the men of the earths. Consequently 'the dragon and his angels' communicate directly with those who are in untruths and the resultant evils derived from the received heresy concerning faith alone. It is therefore said in the verses following:<p>For this rejoice, O heavens; woe to those inhabiting the land and the sea, because the devil has come down to you having great wraths, knowing that he has very little time verse 12 of this chapter; also that:<p>He pursued the woman into the wilderness and went away to wage war with the remnant of her seed verses 13-17.<p>It is to be known that each individual man as to his affections and consequent thoughts is in an association with those who are in the world of spirits, and mediately by means of them either with those who are in heaven or in hell. The life of every man depends on that conjunction. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 552</h4><p>552. He was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him, signifies that he was cast down into the world of spirits, which is intermediate between heaven and hell, from whence there is immediate conjunction with the men of the earth [tellus]. The reason why by "the earth," upon which the dragon is said to have been cast out, is meant the world of spirits, is, because that world is immediately beneath the heavens, and when anyone is cast down from heaven, he does not fall immediately into hell, but upon the earth of the world immediately beneath it, for that world is intermediate between heaven and hell, or below the heavens and above the hells. Many things concerning that world may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, published at London in the year 1758 (<a href="421.htm">421-535</a>) All who are in that world communicate immediately with men upon earth; consequently, the dragon and his angels communicate with those who are in falsities, and thence in evils, through the received heresy of faith alone; on which account, it is said below, "Therefore rejoice, ye heavens; woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea, for the Devil is come down unto you, having great anger, knowing that he hath but a short time (verse 12 of this chapter). Also that "he pursued the woman into the wilderness, and went to make war with the rest of her seed" (verses <a href="3927/revelation_11_13.htm">13-17</a>). It is to be known that every man, as to his affections and thoughts thence, is in society with those who are in the world of spirits, and mediately through them, with those who are either in heaven or in hell. The life of every man depends on that conjunction. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 552 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>552. "Projectus est in terram, et angeli ejus cum illo projecti sunt," significat quod in Mundum spirituum, qui medius est inter Caelum et Infernum, et a quo immediata conjunctio est cum hominibus telluris. - Quod per "terram," in quam Draco dicitur projectus, intelligitur Mundus spirituum, est quia hic mundus immediate sub Caelis jacet, et cum quis dejicitur e Caelo, non cadit illico in Infernum, sed in terram hujus mundi proxime subjectam, est enim ille mundus medius inter Caelum et inter Infernum, seu infra Caelos et supra Inferna. De hoc mundo videantur plura in Opere de Caelo et Inferno, Londini anno 1758 edito (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_552/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_421" target=_top>421-535</a>). Omnes illi qui in eo mundo sunt, communicant immediate cum hominibus telluris, consequentur Draco et angeli ejus cum illis qui in falsis et inde malis sunt ex haeresi recepta de sola Fide; quare in sequentibus dicitur, "Propter haec gaudete Caeli; vae habitantibus terram et mare, quia descendit Diabolus ad vos, habens iram magnam, sciens quod exiguum tempus habeat," (vers. 12 hujus capitis); tum quod "persecutus sit Mulierem in desertum, et abiverit bellum facere cum reliquis seminis ejus," (vers. 13-17). Sciendum est, quod unusquisque homo quoad affectiones et inde cogitationes suas, sit in societate cum illis qui in Mundo spirituum sunt, et mediate per illos cum illis qui vel in Caelo sunt vel in Inferno; vita cujusvis hominis ex illa conjunctione pendet. </p>
