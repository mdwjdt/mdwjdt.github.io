<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>399.“就有雹子与火搀着血”表来自地狱之爱的虚假摧毁良善与真理，并歪曲圣言。“雹”表示摧毁良善与真理的虚假；“火”表示地狱之爱；“血”表示对真理的歪曲。“雹”表示摧毁良善与真理真理的虚假，这一点可见于下文；“火”是指两种意义上的爱，即属天意义上的和地狱意义上的（参看<a href="468.htm">468</a>节）；“血”是指主的神性真理，也就是圣言，在反面意义上是指被歪曲的圣言（<a href="379.htm">379</a>节）。把这些话联成一个意思，明显可知“就有雹子与火搀着血”表示来自地狱之爱的虚假摧毁良善与真理，并歪曲圣言。之所以具有这样的含义，是因为当主的神性之爱和神性智慧从天上降至下面的社群，也就是来自地狱之爱的虚假和圣言由此被歪曲所在之地时，这类事物就会出现在灵界。</p><p>在以下经文中，“雹”与“火”在一起就具有同样的含义：</p><p>因祂面前的光辉，厚云行过便有冰雹火炭；至高者发出声音便有冰雹火炭；祂射出许多箭来，使他们四散。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.12.htm">18:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.14.htm">14</a>）</p><p>我必用瘟疫和流血的事来刑罚，我也必将暴雨、大雹与火并硫磺降与他们。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.22.htm">38:22</a>）</p><p>耶和华必使人在吞灭的火焰和冰雹中听祂的声音。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.30.htm">30:30</a>）</p><p>祂给他们降下冰雹为雨，在他们的地上降下火焰，毁坏他们境内的树木。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.32.htm">105:32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.33.htm">33</a>）</p><p>冰雹打坏他们的葡萄树，下严霜打坏他们的无花果树，又把他们的牲畜交给烧着的炭；祂在猛烈的怒气中打发一群降灾的使者。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.47.htm">78:47</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.49.htm">49</a>）</p><p>这些话论到埃及。关于他们，摩西五经中这样记着说：</p><p>摩西伸杖，耶和华就发声、下雹；有雹，也有火行在雹中，极其严重；雹击打了田间一切的菜蔬，又打坏田间一切的树木。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出9.23.htm">9:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出9.35.htm">35</a>）</p><p>在埃及所行的一切神迹都表示源于地狱之爱的邪恶和虚假，它们就在埃及人当中；每样神迹都表示某种具体的邪恶和虚假，因为他们当中的教会是一个代表性教会，如亚洲许多国家中的那样，但该教会却沦为偶像崇拜，成了巫术；“红海”表示地狱，埃及人最终在红海中灭亡。</p><p>以下经文中的“冰雹”表示类似事物：</p><p>大冰雹比用剑杀死的敌人还多。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书10.11.htm">10:11</a>）</p><p>以下经文中的“冰雹”所表相同：</p><p>祸哉，骄傲的冠冕！主是强大有力的，像一阵冰雹；冰雹必冲去谎言的避所。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 28.1.htm"> 28:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 28.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 28.17.htm">17</a>）</p><p>必有冰雹降下，直到树林下沉。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛32.19.htm">32:19</a>）</p><p>神天上的殿开了，有闪电、声音、雷轰、地震、大雹。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.19.htm">11:19</a>）</p><p>又有一个大冰雹从天落在人身上，约重一他连得。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.21.htm">16:21</a>）</p><p>你见过雹仓吗？乃是为打仗和争战的日子所储备的。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯38.22.htm">38:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯38.23.htm">23</a>）</p><p>对那些抹上未泡透灰的人说，墙要倒塌；必有暴雨漫过，大冰雹啊，你们要降下。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.11.htm">13:11</a>）</p><p>“抹上未泡透灰的”就是确认虚假，好叫它看似真理；所以，凡如此行的人就被称作“冰雹”。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 399</h4><p>399. And hail and fire followed, mingled with blood. This symbolizes falsity springing from a hellish love, destroying goodness and truth and falsifying the Word.<p>Hail symbolizes falsity destroying goodness and truth. Fire symbolizes hellish love. And blood symbolizes the falsification of truth.<p>The reason that hail symbolizes falsity destroying goodness and truth will be seen below. To be shown that fire is love in both senses, heavenly and hellish, see no. <a href="468.htm">468</a>; and that blood is the Lord's Divine truth, which is also the Word, and in an opposite sense, the Word falsified, no. <a href="379.htm">379</a>.<p>When these are assembled into a single meaning, it is apparent that "hail and fire followed, mingled with blood," symbolizes falsity springing from a hellish love, destroying goodness and truth and falsifying the Word.<p>This is the symbolic meaning because these are the kinds of things that appear in the spiritual world when the atmosphere of the Lord's Divine love and wisdom dips down from heaven into societies where there are falsities springing from hellish love and these are used to falsify the Word.</p><p>[2] Hail and fire together have the same symbolism in the following places:<p>From the brightness before Him, ...clouds passed with hailstones and coals of fire... ...the Most High uttered His voice, hailstones and coals of fire. And He sent out His (many) arrows and scattered them... (<a href="3927/psalms_18_12.htm">Psalms 18:12-14</a>)<p>I will dispute... with pestilence and blood, and I will rain down on (them)...hailstones, fire, and brimstone. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_38_22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>)<p>Then Jehovah will cause His... voice to be heard..., with the flame of a devouring fire... and hailstones. (<a href="3927/isaiah_30_30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>)<p>He made their rain hail, a flaming fire in their land..., and splintered the trees of their border. (<a href="3927/psalms_105_32.htm">Psalms 105:32-33</a>)<p>He smote their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with heavy hail, and... their cattle with burning coals... He sent in the wrath of His anger... an incursion of evil angels. (<a href="3927/psalms_78_47.htm">Psalms 78:47-49</a>)<p>The latter passages refer to Egypt, of whom we read in the books of Moses the following:<p>Moses stretched out his rod... and Jehovah sent voices and hail... And there was hail and fire together proceeding in the midst of heavy hail... And the hail struck every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field. (<a href="3927/exodus_9_23.htm">Exodus 9:23-35</a>)<p>All the miracles done in Egypt symbolized those evils and falsities, springing from a hellish love, that existed in the Egyptians, each miracle symbolizing some evil and falsity. For the church with them had been representational, as it was in many Asiatic kingdoms, but one that became idolatrous and given to sorcery. The Red Sea symbolizes hell, in which the Egyptians finally perished.</p><p>[3] The hailstones which killed many more of the enemy than the sword in <a href="3927/joshua_10_11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a> have a similar symbolism. So, too, hail in the following passages:<p>Woe to the crown of pride... ...strong is the Lord, like an inundation of hail... The hail overturns the refuge of lies... (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_1.htm">Isaiah 28:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_28_17.htm">17</a>)<p>It will hail until it flattens the forest... (<a href="3927/isaiah_32_19.htm">Isaiah 32:19</a>)<p>The temple of God was opened in heaven..., and there were lightnings, voices, and thunderings, an earthquake, and great hail. (<a href="3927/revelation_11_19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>)<p>And great hail with the weight of a talent fell from heaven upon men. (<a href="3927/revelation_16_21.htm">Revelation 16:21</a>)<p>...have you seen the treasuries of hail, which have been reserved... for the day of battle and war? (<a href="3927/job_38_22.htm">Job 38:22-23</a>)<p>Say to those who plaster the unsuitable that it will fall. There will be flooding rain, in which you, hailstones, shall fall. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_13_11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a>)<p>To plaster the unsuitable is to defend falsity so that it appears as true. Consequently people who do this are called hailstones. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 399</h4><p>399. 'And hail and fire mingled with blood was produced' signifies untruth derived from infernal love destroying good and truth, and falsifying the Word. By 'hail' is signified untruth destroying good and truth, by 'fire' is signified infernal love, and by 'blood' is signified the falsification of truth. That 'hail' signifies untruth destroying good and truth will be seen below; that 'fire' is love in both a heavenly and an infernal sense may be seen (<a href="468.htm">468</a>); that 'blood' is the Lord's Divine Truth, which is also the Word, and in the opposite sense the Word falsified (<a href="379.htm">379</a>). As a result of the combination of these into one sense it is plain that by 'hail and fire mingled with blood was produced' is signified untruth derived from infernal love destroying good and truth and falsifying the Word. These things are signified because such things appear in the spiritual world when the sphere of the Lord's Divine Love and Wisdom glides down out of heaven into the societies below, where there are untruths derived from infernal love and the Word is being falsified thereby.</p><p>[2] Similar things are signified by 'hail' and 'fire' together in the following passages:<p>At the brightness before Him the clouds passed by, hail and coals of fire; the Most High gave voice, hail and coals of fire; and He hurled His many darts and dispersed them. <a href="3927/psalms_18_12.htm">Psalms 18:12-14</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_18_13.htm">13-15</a>].<p>And I will plead with pestilence and blood, and I will make to rain upon them hailstones, fire, and sulphur. <a href="3927/ezekiel_38_22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>.<p>Then Jehovah shall cause His voice to be heard, in the flame of devouring fire, and the hailstone. <a href="3927/isaiah_30_30.htm">Isaiah 30:30-31</a>.<p>He gave hail for their rains, a fire of flames in their land, and broke the tree of their boundary. <a href="3927/psalms_105_32.htm">Psalms 105:32-33</a>.<p>He smote their vine with hail, and the sycamores with heavy hail, and their herd with burning coals; in the growing wrath of His anger He sent an incursion of evil angels. <a href="3927/psalms_78_47.htm">Psalms 78:47-49</a>.<p>These things [are said] of Egypt. Concerning them it is thus said in Moses:<p>Moses stretched forth the rod, and Jehovah gave voices and hail; and there was hail and fire together walking in the midst of heavy hail: and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field, <a href="3927/exodus_9_23.htm">Exodus 9:23-35</a>.<p>All the miracles done in Egypt were signifying the evils and untruths derived from infernal love that were with the Egyptians; each miracle signifying some evil and untruth; for with them there had been a representative Church, as in many kingdoms of Asia, but it had become idolatrous and magical. By the Red Sea (Mare Suph) is signified hell, in which at length they perished.</p><p>[3] Something similar [is signified] by:<p>The hailstones by which more of the enemy perished than by the sword, <a href="3927/joshua_10_11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>.<p>The like also is signified by 'hail' in the following places:<p>Woe to the crown of pride! the Lord is firm, like an inundation of hail: the hail overturns the refuge of falsehood. <a href="3927/isaiah_28_1.htm">Isaiah 28:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_28_17.htm">17</a>.<p>It shall hail, until the forest will let itself down. <a href="3927/isaiah_32_19.htm">Isaiah 32:19</a>.<p>And the temple of God in heaven was opened, and lightnings, voices, thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail, were produced. <a href="3927/revelation_11_19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>.<p>And there came down from heaven upon men a great hail a talent in weight. <a href="3927/revelation_16_21.htm">Revelation 16:21</a>.<p>Hast thou seen the treasures of hail that are kept back unto the day of battle and war? <a href="3927/job_38_22.htm">Job 38:22-23</a>.<p>Say unto those plastering what is unsuitable, that it will fall, there shall be an inundating rain, in which you, O hailstones, shall fall. <a href="3927/ezekiel_13_11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a>.<p>'To plaster what is unsuitable' is to confirm what is untrue so that it appears true, and therefore those who do this are called 'hailstones. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 399</h4><p>399. And there became hail and fire mingled with blood, signifies falsity from infernal love destroying good and truth, and falsifying the Word. By "hail" is signified falsity destroying good and truth; by "fire" is signified infernal love; and by "blood" is signified the falsification of truth. That "hail" signifies falsity destroying good and truth, will be seen below; that "fire" is love in both senses, celestial and infernal, may be seen, (<a href="468.htm">468</a>); that blood is the Divine truth of the Lord, which is also the Word, and, in the opposite sense, the Word falsified, (<a href="379.htm">379</a>[1-7]). By joining these together into one sense, it is plain, that by "there became hail and fire mingled with blood," is signified falsity from infernal love destroying good and truth and falsifying the Word. This is signified, because such things appear in the spiritual world when the sphere of the Lord's Divine love and Divine wisdom descends from heaven into the societies below, where there are falsities from infernal love, and the Word is falsified thereby.</p><p>[2] "Hail" and "fire" together have a like signification in the following passages:<p>At the brightness before Him the clouds passed by, hailstones and coals of fire; the Most High gave a voice, hailstones and coals of fire; and He sent out His many arrows and scattered them, (<a href="3927/psalms_18_12.htm">Psalms 18:12-14</a>).<p>And I will plead with pestilence and blood, and I will make to rain upon them hailstones, fire, and brimstone, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_38_22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>).<p>And Jehovah shall cause His voice to be heard, in the flame of a devouring fire and hailstone, (<a href="3927/isaiah_30_30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>).<p>He gave them hail for their rains, the fire of flames in their land, and broke the tree of their coasts, (<a href="3927/psalms_105_32.htm">Psalms 105:32-33</a>).<p>The hail smote their vine, and their sycamore trees with grievous hail, and their cattle with burning coals; in the wrath of His anger He sent an incursion of evil angels, (<a href="3927/psalms_78_47.htm">Psalms 78:47-49</a>).<p>These words are applied to Egypt. Concerning them it is thus written in Moses:<p>Moses stretched forth his rod, and Jehovah gave voices and hail; and there was hail and fire together walking in the midst of the grievous hail; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field, (<a href="3927/exodus_9_23.htm">Exodus 9:23-35</a>).<p>All the miracles that were wrought in Egypt signified the evils and falsities from infernal love, which were with the Egyptians; each miracle signifying some particular evil and falsity: for with them was a representative church, as in many kingdoms of Asia, but it became idolatrous and magical; by the "Red Sea" is signified hell, in which at last they perished.</p><p>[3] Something similar is signified by:<p>The hailstones, by which more of the enemy perished than by the sword, (<a href="3927/joshua_10_11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>).<p>The same, also, is meant by "hail" in the following passages:<p>Woe to the crown of pride, the Lord is strong, like an inundation of hail; the hail overturneth the refuge of lies, (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_1.htm">Isaiah 28:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_28_17.htm">17</a>).<p>It shall hail, until the forest sinketh itself down, (<a href="3927/isaiah_32_19.htm">Isaiah 32:19</a>).<p>The temple of God was opened in heaven, and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail, (<a href="3927/revelation_11_19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>).<p>And there came down upon men out of heaven a great hail, about the weight of a talent, (<a href="3927/revelation_16_21.htm">Revelation 16:21</a>).<p>Hast thou seen the treasures of hail which I have reserved unto the day of battle and war? (<a href="3927/job_38_22.htm">Job 38:22-23</a>).<p>Say unto them which daub with what is unfit, that it shall fall; there shall be an inundating rain, in which you, O hailstones, shall fall, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_13_11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a>).<p>"To daub with what is unfit" is to confirm falsity that it may appear like truth; they therefore who do so are called "hailstones." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 399 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>399. "Et facta est grando et ignis mixta sanguine," significat falsum ex amore infernali destruens bonum et verum, et falsificans Verbum. - Per "grandinem" significatur falsum destruens bonum et verum; per "ignem" significatur amor infernalis, et per "sanguinem" significatur falsificatio veri. Quod "grando" significet falsum destruens bonum et verum, videbitur infra; quod "ignis" sit amor in utroque sensu, caelestis et infernalis, videatur, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_399/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_468" target=_top>468</a>; quod "sanguis" sit Divinum Verum Domini, quod etiam est Verbum, et in opposito sensu Verbum falsificatum, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_399/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_379" target=_top>379</a>. Ex his in unum sensum collatis, patet, quod per "facta est grando et ignis mixta sanguine" significetur falsum ex amore infernali destruens bonum et verum, et falsificans Verbum. Quod significentur, est quia in mundo spirituali apparent talia, cum sphaera Divini Amoris et Divinae Sapientiae Domini e Caelo delabitur in societates infra, ubi falsa ex amore infernali sunt, et per illa falsificatur Verbum. Similia per "grandinem" et simul "ignem" significantur in sequentibus locis: <p>"A splendore ante Ipsum nubes transiverunt, Grandine et Prunis ignis: Altissimus dedit vocem, Grandinem et Prunas ignis: et misit tela Sua multa, et dispersit illos," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_399/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_18_13-15" target=_top>Psalm 18:13-15</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_399/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_18_12-14" target=_top>12-14</a>)); <sup>1</sup><p>"Disceptabo peste et sanguine, et Lapides Grandinis, Ignem, et sulphur faciam pluere super illos," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_399/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_38_22" target=_top>Ezechiel 38:22</a>);<p>"Tunc audiri faciet Jehovah vocem Suam, in Flamma Ignis comedentis, et Lapide Grandinis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_399/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_30_30" target=_top>Esaias 30:30</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>"Dedit pluvias eorum Grandinem, ignem flammarum in terra eorum, et confregit arborem termini eorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_399/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_105_32-33" target=_top>Psalm 105:32-33</a>);<p>"Percussit Grando vitem eorum, et sycomoros Grandine gravi, et pecora eorum Prunis: misit in excandescentia irae Suae immissionem angelorum malorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_399/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_78_47-49" target=_top>Psalm 78:47-49</a>); <sup>3</sup><p>haec de Aegypto.
