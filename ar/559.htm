<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第559节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>559.“知道自己的时候不多”表因为他知道新天堂已经形成，因而地上的新教会即将建立，那时他与其同类将被扔进地狱。之所以表示这一点，是因为龙知道新天堂已经形成，他就是从那里被摔下来的（12:8-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.9.htm">9</a>）；他还从启示录（21章）中的预言知道，地上的新教会即将建立；又从启示录（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.1.htm">20:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.10.htm">10</a>）的预言知道到那时，他和他的同类将被扔进地狱。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 559</h4><p>559. "Knowing that it has but a short time." This symbolically means, because it knew that a new heaven had been formed, that a new church on earth was therefore imminent, and that it would then be cast into hell, along with its followers.<p>This is the symbolic meaning because the dragon knew that a new heaven had been formed, inasmuch as it had been cast down from it (verses 8, 9). It knew, too, from the prophecy in <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21</a>, that it would then be cast into hell, along with its followers. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 559</h4><p>559. 'Knowing that he has very little time' signifies because [the dragon] knows that the New Heaven has been formed, and that thus a New Church on earth is imminent, and that then he with his like will be cast into hell. These things are signified because 'the dragon' knows that the New Heaven has been formed, for he has been cast down from it (verses 8-9). Again, he knows also that a New Church on earth is imminent because of what is foretold in the Apocalypse (chapter xxi); and he also knows that he with his like is to be cast into hell, also because of what is foretold (<a href="3927/revelation_20_1.htm">Revelation 20:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_10.htm">10</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 559</h4><p>559. Knowing that he hath but a short time, signifies, because he knows that the New Heaven has been formed, and that thus the New Church upon earth is about to be, and that then he, with his like, will be cast into hell. This is signified, because the dragon knows that the New Heaven has been formed, for he was cast down from it (verses <a href="3927/revelation_12_8.htm">8-9</a>); he knows also that the New Church upon earth is about to be from what is foretold in Revelation, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21</a>); and he also knows that he and his like are then to be cast into hell, from what is also foretold, (<a href="3927/revelation_20_1.htm">20:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_10.htm">10</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 559 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>559. "Sciens quod exiguum tempus habeat," significat quia scit quod novum Caelum factum sit, et quod sic nova Ecclesia in terris instet, et quod ille tunc cum suis in Infernum conjiciatur. - Quod haec significentur, est quia Draco scit quod novum Caelum factum sit, est enim dejectus ab illo (vers. 8, 9) tum scit quod Nova Ecclesia in terris instet, ex praedictione in Apocalypsi, (xxi.); et quoque scit, quod ille cum suis in Infernum tunc conjiciendus sit, etiam ex praedictione, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_559/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_1-2" target=_top>Apocalypsis 20:1-2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_559/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_10" target=_top>10</a>). </p>
