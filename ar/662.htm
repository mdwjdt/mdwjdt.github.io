<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>662.启15:3.“他们唱神仆人摩西的歌，和羔羊的歌”表出于仁爱，因而出于遵行律法条例，也就是十诫的生活，以及对主人性之神性的信的称谢。“唱新歌”是指出于内心喜乐和情感称谢唯独主救主，救世主和天地之神（<a href="279.htm">279</a>，<a href="617.htm">617</a>节）。不过，它在此没有被称为“新歌”，而被称为“神仆人摩西的歌，和羔羊的歌”；“摩西的歌”表示出于遵行律法条例，也就是十诫的生活，因而出于仁爱的称谢，“羔羊的歌”表示出于对主人性之神性的信的称谢；因为“羔羊”表示主的神性人（<a href="269.htm">269</a>，<a href="291.htm">291</a>，<a href="595.htm">595</a>节），从广泛意义上说，“摩西”表示摩西五经中所写的一切律法，从严格意义上说，表示被称为十诫的律法。十诫为人的生活服务，故被称为“神仆人摩西的歌”，因为在圣言中，“仆人”表示服务的人或物（<a href="380.htm">380</a>节），在此表示服务于生活。</p><p>从广泛意义上说，“摩西”表示律法，因为摩西五经被称为“律法（书）”。摩西在摩西五经中所给出的一切诫命、典章、律例都被称为“律法”（<a href="417.htm">417</a>节）。摩西五经中所写的一切都被称为“摩西律法”，以及“摩西”，这一点从以下经文明显看出来:</p><p>腓力说，摩西在律法上所写的和众先知所记的那一位，我们遇见了，就是耶稣。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.45.htm">1:45</a>）</p><p>摩西在律法上吩咐这种人要用石头打死。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.5.htm">8:5</a>）</p><p>按摩西律法满了洁净的日子。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.22.htm">2:22</a>）</p><p>摩西的律法和先知书中凡指着我所写的都必须应验。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.27.htm">24:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.44.htm">44</a>）</p><p>摩西岂不是传律法给你们吗？摩西传了割礼，免得违背摩西的律法。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.19.htm">7:19</a> ，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.22.htm">22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.23.htm">23</a>）</p><p>亚伯拉罕对阴间的财主说，他们有摩西和先知的话可以听从；若不听从摩西和先知的话，就是有一个从死里复活的，他们也是不听劝。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.29.htm">16:29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.31.htm">31</a>）</p><p>写在神仆人摩西律法上的咒诅和誓言都倾在我们身上；这一切灾祸临到我们身上是照摩西律法上所写的。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.11.htm">9:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>你们当记念神仆人摩西的律法，就是我吩咐他的。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛4.4.htm">4:4</a>）</p><p>耶和华对摩西说，看哪，我要在密云中间临到你那里，叫百姓在我与你说话的时候可以听见，也可以永远信你了。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.9.htm">19:9</a>）</p><p>从这些经文明显可知，从广泛意义上说，“摩西”表示由摩西所写的圣言，被称为“律法”。由此推知，“摩西”表示律法，也就是十诫；特别是因为摩西在摔碎前两块石版后，又凿出两块一样的两块石版（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.1.htm">34:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.4.htm">4</a>）；当他将两块石版带下山时，他的面皮发光（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.29.htm">34:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.35.htm">35</a>）；正因如此，在一些图画中，摩西被描绘为手持两块石版。在马可福音，经上还说：</p><p>摩西说，当孝敬父母。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可7.10.htm">7:10</a>）</p><p>约书亚将摩西律法的副本写在祭坛的石头上。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书8.32.htm">8:32</a>）</p><p>这“律法”就是十诫。从这些事可以看出，此处“神仆人摩西的歌”不是指别的，而是指出于仁爱，因而出于遵行律法条例，也就是十诫的生活的称谢。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 662</h4><p>662. <a href="3927/revelation_15_3.htm">15:3</a> They sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb. This symbolizes a confession springing from charity, thus from a life in accordance with the precepts of the Law contained in the Ten Commandments, and from a faith in the Divinity of the Lord's humanity.<p>To sing a new song means to joyfully confess from the heart and affection that the Lord alone is the Savior and Redeemer and the God of heaven and earth, as may be seen in nos. <a href="279.htm">279</a>, <a href="617.htm">617</a> above. Here, however, the song is called not a new song, but the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb; and the song of Moses symbolizes a confession springing from a life in accordance with the precepts of the Law that constitute the Ten Commandments, thus from charity, while the song of the Lamb symbolizes a confession springing from a faith in the Divinity of the Lord's humanity. For the Lamb means the Lord in respect to His Divine humanity (nos. <a href="269.htm">269</a>, <a href="291.htm">291</a>, <a href="595.htm">595</a>), while Moses in a broad sense means all the law written in his five books, and in a strict sense, the Law called the Ten Commandments; and because this serves people in the way they live, the song of Moses is called the song of Moses, the servant of God. For in the Word a servant means someone or something that serves (no. <a href="380.htm">380</a>), in this case for the way one is to live.</p><p>[2] Moses in a broad sense is called the Law because his five books are called the Law. All the commandments, judgments and statutes given through him in his five books are called the Law, as may be seen in no. <a href="417.htm">417</a> above. That everything written in those books is called Moses and the Law of Moses can be seen from the following passages:<p>Philip... said..., "We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law, and of whom the prophets, wrote, Jesus...." (<a href="3927/john_1_45.htm">John 1:45</a>)<p>In the law Moses commanded us to stone such. (<a href="3927/john_8_5.htm">John 8:5</a>)<p>...the days of their purification according to the Law of Moses were completed... (<a href="3927/luke_2_22.htm">Luke 2:22</a>)<p>...all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets... concerning Me. (<a href="3927/luke_24_44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>, cf. <a href="3927/luke_24_27.htm">24:27</a>)<p>Did not Moses give you the Law? ...Moses... gave you circumcision... so that the Law of Moses should not be broken... (<a href="3927/john_7_19.htm">John 7:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_7_22.htm">22-23</a>)<p>Abraham said to (the rich man in hell), "They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them... If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone should rise from the dead." (<a href="3927/luke_16_29.htm">Luke 16:29</a>, <a href="3927/luke_16_31.htm">31</a>)<p>The curse and the oath written in the Law of Moses the servant of God has been poured out on us... As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this evil has come upon us. (<a href="3927/daniel_9_11.htm">Daniel 9:11</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_9_13.htm">13</a>)<p>Remember the Law of Moses, My servant, which I commanded him... (<a href="3927/malachi_4_4.htm">Malachi 4:4</a>)<p>Jehovah said to Moses, "Behold, I will come to you in the mist of a cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and also believe you forever." (<a href="3927/exodus_19_9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>)</p><p>[3] It can be seen from this that Moses in a broad sense means the Word written by him, called the Law. That Moses means the Law that constitutes the Ten Commandments also then follows, and the more so because Moses hewed out the tablets after he broke the first ones (<a href="3927/exodus_34_1.htm">Exodus 34:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_34_4.htm">4</a>); and when he brought them down, his face shone (<a href="3927/exodus_34_29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>). That is why Moses in paintings is depicted holding the tablets in his hand. Moreover, we are told in Mark, "Moses said, Honor your father and your mother" (<a href="3927/mark_7_10.htm">Mark 7:10</a>). And Joshua "wrote on the stones (of the altar) a copy of the Law of Moses" (<a href="3927/joshua_8_32.htm">Joshua 8:32</a>). That Law was the Ten Commandments.<p>It can be seen from this that in the present case, the song of Moses, the servant of God, means nothing else than a confession springing from charity, thus from a life in accordance with the precepts of the Law contained in the Ten Commandments. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 662</h4><p>662. [verse 3] 'And they were singing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb' signifies a confession out of charity, thus out of a life in accordance with the precepts of the Law which is the Decalogue, and out of faith concerning the Divinity of the Lord's Human. That 'to sing a new song' is to confess out of joy of heart and affection that the Only Lord is the Saviour, Redeemer, and God of heaven and earth, may be seen above (<a href="279.htm">279</a>, <a href="617.htm">617</a>). Here, however, it is not termed 'a new song' but 'the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb'; and by 'the song of Moses' is signified confession out of a life in accordance with the precepts of the Law which is the Decalogue, thus out of charity; and by 'the song of the Lamb' confession out of faith concerning the Divinity of the Lord's Human. For by 'the Lamb' is understood the Lord as to the Divine Human (<a href="269.htm">269</a>, <a href="291.htm">291</a>, <a href="595.htm">595</a>); and by 'Moses' is understood in a wide sense all the Law written in his five books, and in a restricted sense the Law that is called the Decalogue. And because the latter is of service to a man for life it is termed 'the song of Moses the servant of God,' for by 'a servant' in the Word is understood a person or thing that is of service (<a href="380.htm">380</a>), here for life.</p><p>[2] The reason why by 'Moses' in a wide sense is understood the Law is because his five books are called 'the Law.' That all the precepts, judgments and statutes given through him in his five books are termed 'the Law' may be seen above (<a href="417.htm">417</a>). That everything written in those books is termed 'the Law of Moses,' and also 'Moses,' can be established from these passages:<p>[Philip] said [to] Nathanael, We have found Jesus, of Whom Moses in the Law, and the Prophets, did write. <a href="3927/john_1_45.htm">John 1:45</a>.<p>In the Law Moses commanded the stoning of such. <a href="3927/john_8_5.htm">John 8:5</a>.<p>The days of their purification according to the Law of Moses were fulfilled. <a href="3927/luke_2_22.htm">Luke 2:22</a>.<p>All the things must be fulfilled that were written in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets concerning Me. <a href="3927/luke_24_27.htm">Luke 24:27</a>, <a href="3927/luke_24_44.htm">44</a>.<p>Did not Moses give you the Law? Moses gave circumcision that the Law of Moses may not be broken. <a href="3927/john_7_19.htm">John 7:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_7_22.htm">22-23</a>.<p>Abraham said to the rich man in hell, They have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear them; if they hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rose from the dead. <a href="3927/luke_16_29.htm">Luke 16:29</a>, <a href="3927/luke_16_31.htm">31</a>.<p>The curse has been poured upon us, and the oath that was written in the Law of Moses the servant of God: as it was written in the Law of Moses, every evil has come upon us. <a href="3927/daniel_9_11.htm">Daniel 9:11</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_9_13.htm">13</a>.<p>Remember the Law of Moses My servant, which I commanded unto him, <a href="3927/matthew_4_4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a> [H.B 3:22].<p>Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, I will come unto you in the midst of a cloud, that the people may hear when I speak to thee, and may also believe thee for ever, <a href="3927/exodus_19_9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>.</p><p>[3] From these passages it can be established that by 'Moses' in a wide sense is understood the Word that was written by him, which is called 'the Law.' It follows from this that by 'Moses' is understood the Law which is the Decalogue, and the more so because Moses hewed out the tables [on which this was written] after he had broken the former ones (<a href="3927/exodus_34_1.htm">Exodus 34:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_34_4.htm">4</a>); and when he carried them down his face shone (<a href="3927/exodus_34_29.htm">Exodus 34:29</a> to the end). Therefore in paintings Moses is depicted holding those tables in his hand. It is also said in Mark:<p>Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother, <a href="3927/mark_7_10.htm">Mark 7:10</a>.<p>Also:<p>Joshua wrote a copy of the Law of Moses upon the stones of an altar, <a href="3927/joshua_8_32.htm">Joshua 8:32</a>.<p>That 'Law' was the Decalogue. From these considerations it can be seen that here by 'the song of Moses the servant of God' nothing else is understood but a confession out of charity, thus out of a life in accordance with the precepts of the Law, which is the Decalogue. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 662</h4><p>662. Verse 3. And they were singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, signifies confession from charity, thus from the life according to the commandments of the Law, which is the Decalogue, and from faith in the Divinity of the Lord's Human. That "to sing a new song" is to confess, from joy of heart and from affection, that the Lord alone is the Savior, the Redeemer, and the God of heaven and earth, may be seen above, (<a href="279.htm">279</a>, <a href="617.htm">617</a>). Here, however, it is not called "a new song," but "the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb," and by "the song of Moses" is signified confession from life according to the commandments of the Law, which is the Decalogue, thus from charity, and by "the song of the Lamb," confession from faith concerning the Divinity of the Lord's Human; for by "the Lamb" is meant the Lord as to the Divine Human, (<a href="269.htm">269</a>, <a href="291.htm">291</a>, <a href="595.htm">595</a>), and by "Moses" is meant, in a wide sense, all the Law written in his five books, and in a restricted sense, the Law which is called the Decalogue. And because this serves man for life, it is called "the song of Moses, the servant of God," for by "a servant," in the Word, is meant one who serves and that which serves, (<a href="380.htm">380</a>), here for life.</p><p>[2] The reason why by "Moses," in a wide sense, is meant the Law, is because his five books are called "the Law." That all the commandments, judgments, and statutes given by him in his five books are called "the Law," may be seen above, (<a href="417.htm">417</a>). That everything written in those books is called "the Law of Moses," and also "Moses," may appear from the following passages:<p>Philip <sup>1</sup>said, We have found Jesus, of whom Moses in the Law, and the Prophets, did write, (<a href="3927/john_1_45.htm">John 1:45</a>).<p>In the Law Moses commanded that such should be stoned, (<a href="3927/john_8_5.htm">John 8:5</a>).<p>The days of their purification, according to the Law of Moses, were fulfilled, (<a href="3927/luke_2_22.htm">Luke 2:22</a>).<p>All things must be fulfilled which are written in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets concerning Me, (<a href="3927/luke_24_27.htm">Luke 24:27</a>, <a href="3927/luke_24_44.htm">44</a>).<p>Did not Moses give you the Law? Moses gave circumcision; that the Law of Moses should not be broken, (<a href="3927/john_7_19.htm">John 7:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_7_22.htm">22-23</a>).<p>Abraham said to the rich man in hell, They have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear them; if they hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rose from the dead, (<a href="3927/luke_16_29.htm">Luke 16:29</a>, <a href="3927/luke_16_31.htm">31</a>).<p>The curse is poured upon us and the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God; as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this evil hath come upon us, (<a href="3927/daniel_9_11.htm">Daniel 9:11</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_9_13.htm">13</a>).<p>Remember the Law of Moses the servant of God, which I commanded him, (<a href="3927/malachi_4_4.htm">Malachi 4:4</a>).<p>Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, I will come unto thee in the mist of a cloud, that the people may hear when I shall speak unto thee, and may also believe in thee forever, (<a href="3927/exodus_19_9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>).</p><p>[3] It may be evident from these passages, that by "Moses" in the wide sense is meant the Word that was written by him, which is called the Law. It follows from this, that the Law which is the Decalogue is meant by "Moses;" and the more so, because Moses hewed out the tables after he had broken the former ones, (<a href="3927/exodus_34_1.htm">Exodus 34:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_34_4.htm">4</a>); and when he carried them down, his face was radiant, (<a href="3927/exodus_34_29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>); on which account Moses is represented in pictures holding these tables in his hand. It is also said in Mark:<p>Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother, (<a href="3927/mark_7_10.htm">Mark 7:10</a>).<p>And Joshua wrote a copy of the Law of Moses upon the stones of the altar, (<a href="3927/joshua_8_32.htm">Joshua 8:32</a>).<p>That Law was the Decalogue. From these things it may be seen, that nothing else is here meant by "the song of Moses the servant of God," but confession from charity, and thus from life according to the commandments of the Law, which are the Decalogue.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original Latin has "Nathaniel." </p>

Quod per "Mosen" in lato sensu intelligatur Lex, est quia quinque ejus Libri vocantur "Lex:" quod omnia praecepta, judicia et statuta per eum data in quinque Libris ejus dicantur "Lex," videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_417" target=_top>417</a>); quod omne scriptum in illis Libris dicatur "Lex Mosis," et quoque "Moses," constare potest ex his locis: <p>Philippus <sup>2</sup>dixit, "Quem scripsit Moses in Lege et Prophetae, invenimus Jesum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_46" target=_top>Johannes 1:46</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_45" target=_top>45</a>));<p>"In Lege Moses praecepit tales lapidare," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_8_5" target=_top>Johannes 8:5</a>); "Impleti sunt dies purificationis eorum juxta Legem Mosis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_2_22" target=_top>Luca 2:22</a>);<p>"Oportet omnia impleri quae scripta sunt in Lege Mosis et Prophetis de Me," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_24_27" target=_top>Luca 24:27</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_24_44" target=_top>44</a>);<p>"Nonne Moses dedit vobis Legem: Moses dedit circumcisionem; ut non solvatur Lex Mosis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_7_19" target=_top>Johannes 7:19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_7_22-23" target=_top>22-23</a>);<p>Dixit Abraham diviti in Inferno, "Habent Mosen et Prophetas, audiunto illos; si non Mosen et Prophetas audiunt, nec si quis ex mortuis resurrexerit, persuadebuntur," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_16_29" target=_top>Luca 16:29</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_16_31" target=_top>31</a>);<p>"Defluxit super nos maledictio et juramentum, quod scriptum est in Lege Mosis servi Dei: sicut scriptum in Lege Mosis, omne malum venit super nos," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_9_11" target=_top>Daniel 9:11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_9_13" target=_top>13</a>); <sup>3</sup><p>"Mementote Legis Mosis servi Mei, quam praecepi illi," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_malachi_3_1-18" target=_top>Malachias 3</a>:22 (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_malachi_4_4" target=_top>4:4</a>));<p>"Dixit Jehovah ad Mosen, Ecce Ego veniam ad te in nebula nubis, ut audiat populus quando locutus fuero ad te, etiamque in te credant in aeternum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_19_9" target=_top>Exodus 19:9</a>).<p>Ex his constare potest, quod per "Mosen" in lato sensu intelligatur Verbum quod ab illo scriptum est, quod vocatur Lex. Quod per "Mosen" intelligatur Lex quae Decalogus, inde sequitur; et eo plus quia Moses sculpsit Tabulas postquam priores fregerat, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_34_1" target=_top>Exodus 34:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_34_4" target=_top>4</a>); <sup>4</sup>et cum illas deportavit, radiavit facies ejus, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_34_29" target=_top>Exodus 34:29</a> ad fin.); <sup>5</sup>quare Moses in picturis sistitur tenens Tabulas illas in manu. Etiam dicitur apud Marcum, <p>"Moses dixit, Honora patrem tuum et matrem tuam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_7_10" target=_top>7:10</a>);<p>"Et Joschua scripsit copiam Legis Mosis super lapidibus Altaris," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_662/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joshua_8_32" target=_top>Joschua 8:32</a>).<p>Lex illa erat Decalogus. Ex his videri potest, quod hic per "canticum Mosis servi Dei" non aliud intelligatur quam confessio ex charitate, ita ex vita secundum praecepta Legis, quae Decalogus.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;617 pro "615"<p>2.&nbsp;Philippus pro "Nathanael"<p>3.&nbsp;13 pro "12"<p>4.&nbsp;34:1, 4 pro "24:1, 3"<p>5.&nbsp;xxxiv. pro "xxiv." </p>
