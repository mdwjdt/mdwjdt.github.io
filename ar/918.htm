<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第918节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>918.启21:22.“我未见城内有殿，因主神全能者和羔羊为城的殿”表新教会不会有任何脱离内在之物的外在之物，因为在其神性人中的主自己就是那被靠近、敬拜和爱慕的独一无二者，新教会的一切事物皆来自祂的神性人。“我未见城内有殿”并非表示新教会，也就是新耶路撒冷没有任何殿，而是表示它不会有脱离内在之物的外在之物。这是因为“殿”表示教会的敬拜，在至高意义上表示在当受到敬拜的神性人方面的主自己（参看<a href="191.htm">191</a>，<a href="529.htm">529</a>，<a href="585.htm">585</a>节）；由于教会的一切事物皆来自主，故经上说“因主神全能者和羔羊为城的殿”，以此表示在其神性人中的主。“主神全能者”表示永恒之主，就是耶和华自己，羔羊”表示祂的神性人，如前面频繁所述。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 918</h4><p>918. <a href="3927/revelation_21_22.htm">21:22</a> But I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. This symbolically means that the New Church will have no external element divorced from an internal one, because it turns to the Lord Himself in His Divine humanity, from whom comes everything connected with the church, and worships and adores Him alone.<p>John's not seeing a temple in the city does not mean that the New Church, or New Jerusalem, will not have any temples in it, but that it will not have any external element without an internal one. That is because a temple symbolizes the church in respect to its worship, and in a higher sense the Lord Himself in respect to His Divine humanity, which is to be worshiped, as may be seen in nos. <a href="191.htm">191</a>, <a href="529.htm">529</a>, <a href="585.htm">585</a> above. Moreover, because everything connected with the church comes from the Lord, therefore we are told that the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the city's temple, which symbolizes the Lord in His Divine humanity. The Lord God Almighty means the Lord from eternity, who is Jehovah Himself, and the Lamb symbolizes His Divine humanity, as we have said many times above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 918</h4><p>918. [verse 22] 'And I saw no temple therein, for the Lord God Almighty is the temple thereof, and the Lamb' signifies that in this Church there will not be any external separated from what is internal, because the Lord Himself in His Divine Human, from Whom is everything of the Church, is the Only One being approached, worshipped and adored. By 'I saw no temple therein' is not understood that in the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, there will be no temple, but that in it there will not be what is external separated from what is internal. This is because by 'a temple' is signified the Church as to worship, and in the uppermost (supernus) sense the Lord Himself as to the Divine Human, Who is to be worshipped, as may be seen above (<a href="191.htm">191</a>, <a href="529.htm">529</a>, <a href="585.htm">585</a>); and because everything of the Church is from the Lord it is therefore said 'for the Lord God Almighty is the temple thereof and the Lamb,' by which is signified the Lord in His Divine Human. By 'the Lord God Almighty' is understood the Lord from what is eternal, Who is Jehovah Himself, and by 'the Lamb' is signified His Divine Human, as frequently above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 918</h4><p>918. Verse 22. And I saw no temple therein; for the Lord God Almighty is the temple of it, and the Lamb, signifies that in this church there will not be any external separated from the internal, because the Lord Himself in His Divine Human, from whom is the all of the church is alone approached, worshiped, and adored. By "I saw no temple therein" is not meant that in the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, there will not be temples, but in it there will not be an external separated from the internal; the reason is because by "a temple" is signified the church as to worship, and, in the highest sense, the Lord Himself as to the Divine Human, who is to be worshiped; see above, (<a href="191.htm">191</a>, <a href="529.htm">529</a>, <a href="585.htm">585</a>); and since the all of the church is from the Lord, therefore it is said, "for the Lord God Almighty is the temple of it, and the Lamb" by which is signified the Lord in His Divine Human; by "the Lord God Almighty" is meant the Lord from eternity who is Jehovah Himself, and by "the Lamb" is signified His Divine Human, as has been frequently stated above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 918 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>918. (Vers. 22.) "Et templum non vidi in ea, quia Dominus Deus Omnipotens Templum ejus est et Agnus," significat quod in hac Ecclesia non aliquod externum separatum ab interno erit, quia Ipse Dominus in Divino Humano Suo, a Quo est omne Ecclesiae, Solus aditur, colitur et adoratur. - Per "templum non vidi in ea," non intelligitur quod in Nova Ecclesia, quae est Nova Hierosolyma, non erunt templa; sed quod in illa non erit externum separatum ab interno; causa est, quia per "templum" significatur Ecclesia quoad cultum, et in superno sensu Ipse Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum, Qui colendus est, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_918/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_191" target=_top>191</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_918/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_529" target=_top>529</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_918/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_585" target=_top>585</a>); et quia omne Ecclesiae est a Domino, ideo dicitur, "quia Dominus Deus Omnipotens Templum ejus est et Agnus," per quae significatur Dominus in Divino Humano Suo; per "Dominum Deum Omnipotentem" intelligitur Dominus ab aeterno, Qui est Ipse Jehovah, et per "Agnum" significatur Divinum Humanum Ipsius, ut saepius supra. </p>
