<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第774节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>774.“各样香木，各样象牙的器皿”表他们不再拥有这些事物，因为他们没有与这类事物相对应的属世良善和真理。这些事物类似于前面所阐述的事物（<a href="772.htm">772</a>，<a href="773.htm">773</a>节），唯一区别在于，首先提及的事物表示属灵的良善和真理，如前所述（<a href="722.htm">722</a>节），其次所提及的事物表示属天的良善和真理，如刚才所述（<a href="723.htm">723</a>节），现在所提及的事物，也就是“香木”和“象牙的器皿”表示属世的良善和真理。</p><p>智慧与爱有三个层级，因而真理和良善也有三个层级。第一层被属天的，第二层被称为属灵的，第三层被称为属世的。每个人自出生时就具有这三个层级；它们还总体上存在于天堂和教会中。这就是为何天堂有三层，即最高层，中间层和最低层，并照着这些层级而完全不同；主在地上的教会同样如此。至于它在那些处于属天层之人，处于属灵层之人，以及处于属世层之人当中各是何性质，则无需在此阐述。不过，相关内容可参看《圣爱与圣智》一书的第三部分，那里论述了这些层级。此处仅说明那些属巴比伦的人既没有属灵的良善和真理，也没有属天的良善和真理，甚至没有属世的良善和真理就足够了。之所以首先提及属灵之物，是因为他们当中有许多人只要发自内心视圣言为神圣，就像他们嘴上说的那样，就能变得属灵。然而，他们无法变得属天，因为他们不靠近主，反而靠近死人或活人，并敬拜他们。这就是为何其次提及属天之物。</p><p>“香木”之所以表示属世良善，是因为在圣言中，“木”表示良善，“石”表示真理；“香木”之名源于“二”，“二”也表示良善。木是一种属世良善，因为木不像金、银、宝石、珍珠、细麻布、紫色料、朱红色料那样是珍贵材料。石头也不是珍贵材料。表示属世真理的“象牙”也一样。“象牙”之所以表示属世真理，是因为它是白色且能被抛光，还因为它取自大象之口，也构成它的力量。为了让“象牙”可以成为“香木”所表示的良善之属世真理，经上提到“象牙的器皿”，因为“器皿”表示某种盛纳之物，在此表示盛良善的真理。</p><p>“木”表示良善，这一点从下列经文在某种程度上得以证实：</p><p>在玛拉的苦水因为丢进木头而变甜。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出15.25.htm">15:25</a>）</p><p>刻有诫命的石版被放在皂荚木制成的柜子里。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.10.htm">25:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.16.htm">16</a>）</p><p>耶路撒冷圣殿外面用香柏木板遮顶，里面用香柏木贴墙。（列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.9.htm">6:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.15.htm">15</a>）</p><p>在旷野用荚木做坛。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.1.htm">27:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>此外还能从以下经文得以证实：</p><p>墙里的石头必呼叫，木梁必应声。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.11.htm">2:11</a>）</p><p>他们必以你的财宝为掳物，以你的货财为掠物，将你的石头、木头都抛在海中。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结 26.12.htm"> 26:12</a>）</p><p>对先知说：</p><p>你要取一根木杖，在其上写犹大和以色列人之名，在另一根木杖上写约瑟和以法莲之名；我要使它们（两根木杖）成为一根木杖。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.16.htm">37:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.19.htm">19</a>）</p><p>我们出银子才得水喝，我们的木柴是作价来的。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀5.4.htm">5:4</a>）</p><p>就如人与同伴同入森林，斧头从木把脱落到同伴身上，以致他死，这人要逃到一座逃城。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申 19.5.htm"> 19:5</a>）</p><p>这是因为“木（把）”表示良善，因而他不是出于邪恶或恶意，而是出于失误将同伴致死，因他处于良善；此外还有其它地方。</p><p>但“木”在反面意义上表示邪恶和可诅咒之物，如他们用木头雕刻偶像并崇拜它们（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.23.htm">4:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.28.htm">28</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.19.htm">37:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.20.htm">40:20</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.3.htm">10:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.8.htm">8</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.32.htm">20:32</a>）；还有，被挂在木头上就是一种诅咒（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.22.htm">21:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.23.htm">23</a>）。</p><p>“象牙”表示属世真理，这一点从提及象牙的经文明显看出来（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.6.htm">27:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.15.htm">15</a>；阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩3.15.htm">3:15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩6.4.htm">6:4</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.8.htm">45:8</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 774</h4><p>774. "Every kind of thyine wood, <sup>1</sup>every kind of ivory vessel." This symbolically means that these Roman Catholics no longer have these because they do not have any of the natural goods and truths to which such things correspond.<p>This statement is similar to the ones explained in nos. <a href="772.htm">772</a> and <a href="773.htm">773</a> above, the only difference being that the valuables named first mean spiritual goods and truths (as explained in no. <a href="772.htm">772</a> above), and that those named second mean celestial goods and truths (as explained just above in no. 773), while those named now - thyine wood and ivory vessel - mean natural goods and truths.</p><p>[2] To explain: There are three degrees of wisdom and love, and so three degrees of truth and goodness. We call the first degree celestial, the second spiritual, and the third natural. These three degrees are present from birth in every person, and they are present in general also in heaven and in the church. Because of this there are three heavens, a highest one, an intermediate one, and a lowest one, altogether distinct from each other in accordance with these degrees. The same is true of the Lord's church on earth. But this is not the place to explain the nature of the church with people in the celestial degree, with people in the spiritual degree, and with people in the natural degree. See instead what we said about them in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom, Part Three, where we dealt with degrees. Here we will say only that in the case of people coming from Babylon, they have no spiritual goods and truths, no celestial goods and truths, and not even any natural goods and truths.<p>Spiritual goods and truths are mentioned first, because many of those coming from Babylon can be spiritual, provided they hold the Word holy at heart, as they do with the mouth. But they cannot become celestial, because they do not turn to the Lord, but turn to people living and dead and worship them. It is for this reason that celestial goods and truths are mentioned second.</p><p>[3] Thyine wood symbolizes natural good because wood in the Word symbolizes goodness, and stone truth, and thyine wood derives its name from a word meaning two, and the number two also symbolizes goodness.<p>The good symbolized is natural good, because wood is not a valuable material like gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet. The same is true of stone. The case is similar with ivory, which symbolizes natural truth. Ivory symbolizes natural truth because it is white and can be polished, and because it protrudes from the mouth of an elephant and also constitutes its might. In order for ivory to symbolize the natural truth of the goodness symbolized by thyine wood, the text specifies a vessel of ivory, as a vessel symbolizes something that contains, here truth that contains good.</p><p>[4] That wood symbolizes goodness can be seen to some extent from the following considerations: That the bitter waters at Marah were made sweet by casting in something wooden (<a href="3927/exodus_15_25.htm">Exodus 15:25</a>). That the tables of stone on which the Law was written were placed in an ark made of acacia wood (<a href="3927/exodus_25_10.htm">Exodus 25:10-16</a>). That the Temple in Jerusalem was roofed with wood and paneled inside with wood (<a href="3927/1-kings_6_9.htm">1 Kings 6:9</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_15.htm">15</a>). And that the altar in the wilderness was made of wood (<a href="3927/exodus_27_1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_27_6.htm">6</a>).<p>It can be seen to some extent also from the following:<p>...the stone will cry out from the wall, and the beam from the wood answers it. (<a href="3927/habakkuk_2_11.htm">Habakkuk 2:11</a>)<p>They will plunder your riches and pillage your merchandise..., and they will cast your stones and your timber... into the midst of the sea. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_26_12.htm">Ezekiel 26:12</a>)<p>The prophet Ezekiel was told to take a piece of wood and write on it the names of Judah and the children of Israel, and also on another piece of wood the names of Joseph and Ephraim; and that the Lord Jehovih would make them into one piece of wood (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_19.htm">19</a>).<p>We drink our water in exchange for silver, and our wood comes at a price. (<a href="3927/lamentations_5_4.htm">Lamentations 5:4</a>)<p>If someone goes with his neighbor into a forest..., and the ax head (falls) from the wooden handle...(onto) his neighbor so that he dies, he shall flee to (a city of refuge). (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_19_5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>)<p>The latter is said because wood symbolizes goodness, and so because the person did not kill his neighbor out of evil or with evil intention, therefore, but by accident, being impelled by good. And so on elsewhere.</p><p>[5] In an opposite sense, however, wood symbolizes something evil or cursed. So for example, they made graven images out of wood and worshiped them (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_4_23.htm">Deuteronomy 4:23-28</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_37_19.htm">Isaiah 37:19</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_40_20.htm">40:20</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_8.htm">8</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_20_32.htm">Ezekiel 20:32</a>). Also, being hanged from a tree was a curse (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_21_22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>).<p>That ivory symbolizes natural truth can be seen moreover from passages which mention ivory, such as <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_6.htm">Ezekiel 27:6</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/amos_3_15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>; <a href="3927/amos_6_4.htm">6:4</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_45_8.htm">Psalms 45:8</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Thyine wood has not been identified. It has been associated with citron wood, and also with scented wood in general. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 774</h4><p>774. 'And all thyme wood and every ivory vessel' signifies that they no longer have those things because they do not have the natural goods and truths to which such things correspond. These things are similar to those that have been expounded above (<a href="772.htm">772-773</a>), with the difference only that by those named first are understood the spiritual goods and truths treated of above (<a href="772.htm">772</a>), and that by those named second are understood the celestial goods treated of just above (<a href="773.htm">773</a>), and that by those named now which are 'thyme wood' and 'ivory vessel' are understood natural goods and truths.</p><p>[2] For there are three degrees of wisdom and love and consequently three degrees of truth and good. The first degree is called celestial, the second spiritual, and the third natural. These three degrees exist with every man from births; and they also exist in general in heaven and the Church. This is why there are three heavens, the highest, the middle, and the lowest altogether distinct from each other in accordance with those degrees; in like manner the Lord's Church on earth. But what it is like with those who are in the celestial degree, and what it is like with those who are in the spiritual degree, and what it is like with those who are in the natural degree, does not require to be set forth here. However, [something] may be seen concerning them in ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM, in the third section, where degrees have been treated of. Here [it suffices to set forth] only that with those who are of Babylon there are neither spiritual goods and truths nor celestial goods and truths, and not even natural goods and truths. The spiritual things are named in the first place because many of them can be spiritual provided at heart they hold the Word holy, as they say [it is] by mouth. They cannot become celestial, however, because they do not approach the Lord but approach living and dead men and worship them. This is why the celestial things are named in the second place.</p><p>[3] The reason why 'thyme wood' signifies natural good is because 'wood' in the Word signifies good and 'stone' truth, and 'thyme wood' derives its name from 'two,' and 'two' also signifies good. That it is a natural good is because wood is not a precious material like gold, silver, precious stone, pearl, fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet. Stone likewise is not. It is similar with 'ivory' by which natural truth is signified. 'Ivory' signifies natural truth because it is white and can be polished, and because it protrudes out of an elephant's mouth and also makes his strength. In order that the 'ivory' may be the natural truth of the good that is signified by 'thyme wood' it is said 'ivory vessel,' for by a vessel is signified something containing, here the truth containing the good.</p><p>[4] That 'wood' signifies good may to some extent be established from these statements:<p>That the bitter waters at Marah were made sweet by wood cast in <a href="3927/exodus_15_25.htm">Exodus 15:25</a>.<p>That the tablets of stone on which the law was inscribed were laid up in an ark made of shittim wood, <a href="3927/exodus_25_10.htm">Exodus 25:10-16</a>.<p>That the Jerusalem temple was covered without and lined within with wood, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_10.htm">1 Kings 6:10</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_15.htm">15</a>.<p>That the altar in the wilderness was made out of wood, <a href="3927/exodus_27_1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_27_6.htm">6</a>.<p>Besides from these:<p>The stone cries out from the wall, and the beam of wood answers, <a href="3927/habakkuk_2_11.htm">Habakkuk 2:11</a>.<p>They shall seize thy riches and despoil thy merchandise, and they shall put thy stones and thy woods into the midst of the sea. <a href="3927/ezekiel_26_12.htm">Ezekiel 26:12</a>.<p>It was said to the prophet that he should take one [piece of] wood so that he might write upon it the name of Judah and of the sons of Israel, and also [another piece and write upon it] the name of Joseph and Ephraim; and I will make them into one [piece of] wood. <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_19.htm">19</a>.<p>We drink our waters for silver, and our woods come for a price, <a href="3927/lamentations_5_4.htm">Lamentations 5:4</a>.<p>If anyone comes with a companion into a forest and his axe falls out of the wood upon the companion so that he dies, he shall flee into a city of refuge. <a href="3927/deuteronomy_19_5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>.<p>This was because 'wood' signifies good, and thus that he had not put the companion to death as the result of evil or an evil intention but as a result of a mistake, because he was in good; besides elsewhere.</p><p>[5] But by 'wood' in the opposite sense is signified what is evil and accursed, as that they made graven images out of wood and adored them (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_4_23.htm">Deuteronomy 4:23-28</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_37_19.htm">Isaiah 37:19</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_40_20.htm">40:20</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_8.htm">8</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_20_32.htm">Ezekiel 20:32</a>); also that 'hanging upon wood' was a curse (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_21_22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>). That 'ivory' signifies natural truth can also be established from the passages where it is named, as <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_6.htm">Ezekiel 27:6</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_27_15.htm">15</a>; <a href="3927/amos_3_15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>; <a href="3927/amos_6_4.htm">6:4</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_45_8.htm">Psalms 45:8</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_45_9.htm">9</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 774</h4><p>774. And all thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, signifies that they no longer have these, because they have not the natural goods and truths, to which such things correspond. These things are similar to those which were explained above, (<a href="772.htm">772</a>, <a href="773.htm">773</a>); with the difference only that by those named first spiritual goods and truths are meant, which are treated of above, (<a href="772.htm">772</a>); and that by those mentioned in the second place celestial goods and truths are meant, as explained just above, (<a href="773.htm">773</a>); and that by these now mentioned, which are "thyine wood and vessels of ivory," natural goods and truths are meant.</p><p>[2] For there are three degrees of wisdom and love, and thence three degrees of truth and good. The first degree is called celestial, the second spiritual, and the third natural. These three degrees are in every man from birth, and also in general they are in heaven and in the church; which is the cause of there being three heavens, the highest, the middle, and the lowest, altogether distinct from each other according to those degrees; in like manner the Lord's church on earth. But what its quality is with those who are in the celestial degree, and what in those who are in the spiritual degree, and what in those who are in the natural degree, does not belong to this place to explain, but see concerning them in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom, chapter 3, where degrees are treated of; here only that with those who are of Babylon there are not spiritual goods and truths, nor celestial goods and truths, and not even natural goods and truths. That spiritual things are mentioned in the first place, is because many among them can be spiritual, provided they hold the Word holy in heart, as they say with their mouth; but they cannot become celestial, because they do not approach the Lord, but approach living and dead men, and worship them. This is the reason why the celestial things are named in the second place.</p><p>[3] By "thyine wood" is signified natural good, because "wood" in the Word signifies good, and "stone" truth; and "thyine wood" takes its name from two, and "two" also signifies good. That it is natural good, is because wood is not a costly material, like gold, silver, precious stone, pearl, fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet, stone likewise. It is the same with ivory, by which natural truth is signified. "Ivory" signifies natural truth, because it is white, and can be polished, and because it protrudes from the mouth of an elephant, and likewise makes his strength. That "ivory" may be the natural truth of that good which is signified by "thyine wood," it is said "a vessel of ivory;" for by "a vessel" that which contains is signified; here truth the containant of good.</p><p>[4] That "wood" signifies good may be in some degree evident from these passages:<p>That the bitter waters in Marah were made sweet by wood cast in, (<a href="3927/exodus_15_25.htm">Exodus 15:25</a>.<p>That the tables of stone, on which the Law was written, were laid up in an ark made of shittim wood, (<a href="3927/exodus_25_10.htm">Exodus 25:10-16</a>).<p>That the temple at Jerusalem was covered and sheathed within with wood, (<a href="3927/1-kings_6_10.htm">1 Kings 6:10</a>, <a href="3927/1-kings_6_15.htm">15</a>).<p>That the altar in the wilderness was made of wood, (<a href="3927/exodus_27_1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>, <a href="3927/exodus_27_6.htm">6</a>).<p>Besides from these:<p>The stone crieth out from the wall, and the beam of wood answereth, (<a href="3927/habakkuk_2_11.htm">Habakkuk 2:11</a>).<p>They shall seize thy wealth, and make a prey of thy merchandise, and thy stones and thy woods shall they put into the midst of the sea, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_26_12.htm">Ezekiel 26:12</a>).<p>It was said to the prophet, that he should take one piece of wood, and write upon it the name of Judah and of the sons of Israel; and also the name of Joseph and Ephraim; and should make them into one piece, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_37_16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_37_19.htm">19</a>).<p>We drink our waters for silver, and our wood cometh for a price, (<a href="3927/lamentations_5_4.htm">Lamentations 5:4</a>).<p>If anyone goeth into a forest with a companion, and his axe falleth from the wood upon his companion, that he die, he shall flee into a city of refuge, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_19_5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>).<p>This was because "wood" signifies good, and thus that he had not put his companion to death from evil, or with evil intention, but from an error, because he was in good; besides other places.</p><p>[5] But by "wood" in the opposite sense is signified what is evil and cursed; as that they made graven images of wood, and adored them, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_4_23.htm">Deuteronomy 4:23-28</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_37_19.htm">Isaiah 37:19</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_40_20.htm">40:20</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3</a>, <a href="3927/jeremiah_10_8.htm">8</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_20_32.htm">Ezekiel 20:32</a>); also that hanging upon wood was a curse, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_21_22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>).

"Et omne lignum thyinum et omne vas eburneum," significat quod haec illis non amplius sint, quia non illis sunt naturalia bona et vera, quibus talia correspondent. -Haec similia sunt cum illis, quae supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_772" target=_top>772</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_773" target=_top>773</a>) explicata sunt, cum sola differentia, quod per primum nominata intelligantur bona et vera spiritualia, de quibus supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_772" target=_top>772</a>); et quod per secundo nominata intelligantur bona et vera caelestia, de quibus mox supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_773" target=_top>773</a>); et quod per haec nunc nominata, quae sunt "lignum thyinum et vas eburneum" intelligantur bona et vera naturalia. Sunt enim tres gradus sapientiae et amoris, et inde tres gradus veri et boni; primus gradus vocatur caelestis, secundus spiritualis, et tertius naturalis. Hi tres gradus sunt ex nativitate apud unumquemvis hominem, et quoque sunt in communi in Caelo et in Ecclesia; quae causa est quod Caeli tres sint, supremum, medium et ultimum, inter se prorsus distincti secundum illos gradus; similiter Ecclesia Domini in terris; sed qualis est apud illos qui in gradu caelesti sunt, et qualis apud illos qui in gradu spirituali sunt, et qualis apud illos qui in gradu naturali sunt, non hujus loci est exponere, sed videatur de illis in Sapientia Angelica de Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia, in Classe Tertia, ubi de Gradibus actum est; hic solum, quod apud illos qui e Babylone sunt, non sint bona et vera spiritualia, nec bona et vera caelestia, et ne quidem bona et vera naturalia. Quod spiritualia primo loco nominentur, est quia multi ex illis possunt spirituales esse, modo sanctum habeant Verbum corde, sicut ore dicunt; at non possunt caelestes fieri, quia non adeunt Dominum, sed adeunt homines vivos et mortuos, et colunt; haec causa est, quod caelestia secundo loco nominentur. Quod per "lignum thyinum" significetur bonum naturale, est quia "lignum" in Verbo significat bonum, et "lapis" verum, ac "lignum thyinum" ducit suam denominationem ex duo, ac "duo" etiam significant bonum: quod sit bonum naturale, est quia lignum non est materia pretii, sicut est aurum, argentum, lapis pretiosus, margarita, byssus, purpura, sericum et coccinum; similiter lapis. Simile est cum ebore, per quod significatur verum naturale; quod "ebur" significet verum naturale, est quia est album, et poliri potest, et quia protenditur ex ore elephantis et quoque facit robur ejus. Ut "ebur" sit verum naturale illius boni quod significatur per "lignum thyinum," dicitur "vas eburneum;" per "vas" enim significatur continens, hic verum continens boni. Quod "lignum" significet bonum aliquatenus constare potest (ex) his: <p>Quod aquae amarae in Marah dulces factae sint per Lignum injectum, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_15_25" target=_top>Exodus 15:25</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>Quod Tabulae lapideae, quibus Lex fuit inscripta, in Arca ex lignis schittim facta, fuerint repositae, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_25_10-16" target=_top>Exodus 25:10-16</a>);<p>Quod Templum Hierosolymitanum Ligno fuerit tectum ac intus vestitum, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_1-kings_6_10" target=_top>1 Regnum 6:10</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_1-kings_6_15" target=_top>15</a>);<p>Quod Altare in deserto ex Ligno factum fuerit, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_27_1" target=_top>Exodus 27:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_27_6" target=_top>6</a>).<p>Praeter ex his: <p>"Lapis e pariete clamat, et trabs ex Ligno respondet," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_habakkuk_2_11" target=_top>Habakuk 2:11</a>);<p>"Diripient opes tuas, et depraedabuntur merces tuas, et lapides tuos et Ligna tua in medium maris dabunt," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_26_12" target=_top>Ezechiel 26:12</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>Dictum ad Prophetam, ut sumeret unum Lignum, ut scriberet super illo nomen Judae et filiorum Israelis, et quoque nomen Josephi et Ephraimi; "et faciam illos in Lignum unum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_37_16" target=_top>Ezechiel 37:16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_37_19" target=_top>19</a>); <sup>3</sup><p>"Aquas nostras pro argento bibimus, et Ligna nostra pro pretio veniunt," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_lamentations_5_4" target=_top>Threni 5:4</a>);<p>"Si quis cum socio venit in sylvam, et cadit securis e Ligno in socium ut moriatur, fugiet in urbem azyli," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_774/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_19_5" target=_top>Deuteronomius 19:5</a>);<p>hoc ideo, quia "lignum" significat bonum, et sic quod non morti dederit socium ex malo seu mala intentione, sed ex errore, quia in bono fuit; praeter alibi.
