<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第667节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>667.“众族都要来在你面前敬拜”表所有处于爱与仁之善的人都将承认唯独主是神。“众族”表示那些处于爱与仁之善的人；这些人以正面意义上的“众（民）族”来表示（<a href="483.htm">483</a>节）。“来在祂面前敬拜”表示承认主为神，因为只有一位神，三位一体就在祂里面，而主就是这位神，故这句话表示承认唯独主是神。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 667</h4><p>667. "Therefore all nations shall come and worship before You." This symbolically means that people who possess the goodness of love and charity will acknowledge the Lord alone to be God.<p>All nations symbolize people who possess the goodness of love and charity. That this is the meaning of nations in a good sense may be seen in no. <a href="483.htm">483</a> above. To come and worship before Him means, symbolically, to acknowledge the Lord as God, and because there is only one God, in whom is the Trinity, and the Lord is that God, it symbolically means to acknowledge Him alone to be God. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 667</h4><p>667. 'Therefore all the nations shall come and adore before Thee' signifies that all who are in the good of love and charity will acknowledge the Lord to be the Only God. By 'all the nations' are signified those who are in the good of love and charity. That these are understood by 'the nations' when [said] in a good sense may be seen above (<a href="483.htm">483</a>). By 'to come and adore before Him' is signified to acknowledge the Lord as God; and because there is one God, in Whom is the Trinity, and the Lord is He, it signifies to acknowledge Him to be the Only God. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 667</h4><p>667. Therefore all the nations shall come and adore before Thee, signifies that all who are in the good of love and charity, will acknowledge the Lord alone as God. By "all nations" are signified they who are in the good of love and charity; that these are meant by "nations," in a good sense, may be seen above, (<a href="483.htm">483</a>). "To come and adore before Him," signifies to acknowledge the Lord as God, and as there is one God in whom there is the Trinity, and that the Lord is He, it signifies to acknowledge Him alone as God. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 667 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>667. "Quare omnes gentes venient et adorabunt coram Te," significat quod omnes qui in bono amoris et charitatis sunt, agnoscent Dominum Solum Deum. -Per "omnes gentes" significantur qui in bono amoris et charitatis sunt; quod hi per "gentes," dum in sensu bono, intelligantur, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_667/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_483" target=_top>483</a>); per "venire et adorare coram Ipso" significatur agnoscere Dominum pro Deo; et quia unus est Deus, in quo Trinitas, et Dominus est Ille, significatur agnoscere Ipsum Solum Deum. </p>
