<p>727.“珍珠”表他们当中属于圣言的对良善与真理的认知。就灵义而言，“珍珠”表示对来自圣言、尤其来自其字义的良善与真理的认知，无论属天的还是属灵的；“珍珠”因表示这些认知，故在“紫色和朱红色”，以及“金子和宝石”之后被提及。在以下经文中，“珍珠”也表示这些认知：</p><p>天国又好像买卖人寻找好珠子；遇见一颗重价的珠子，就去变卖他一切所有的，买了这颗珠子。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.45.htm">13:45</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.46.htm">46</a>）</p><p>“珍珠”表示关于主的认知。</p><p>新耶路撒冷城墙的十二个门是十二颗珍珠，每门是一颗珍珠。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.21.htm">21:21</a>）</p><p>“新耶路撒冷的这些门”表示引入新教会，引入通过对来自圣言的良善与真理的认知实现。</p><p>不要把你们的珍珠丢在猪前，恐怕它们用脚践踏了珍珠，转过来咬你们。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.6.htm">7:6</a>）</p><p>“猪”表示那些只热爱世俗财富、不喜欢属灵财富，也就是来自圣言的良善和真理的认知之人。由于“巴比伦”表示弃绝源于圣言的一切良善与真理的认知的宗教，故经上论到她说：</p><p>地上的客商也都为巴比伦哭泣悲哀，因为没有人再买他们的货物了；这货物就是金、银、宝石和珍珠。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.11.htm">18:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.12.htm">12</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 727</h4><p>727. And pearls. This symbolizes the concepts of goodness and truth contained in the Word among Roman Catholics.<p>In the spiritual sense pearls symbolize concepts of both celestial and spiritual goodness and truth that come from the Word, in particular from its literal meaning; and because pearls symbolize those concepts, therefore they are mentioned after purple and scarlet and after gold and precious stones.<p>These concepts are symbolized by pearls also in the following passages:<p>...the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it. (<a href="3927/matthew_13_45.htm">Matthew 13:45-46</a>)<p>The pearl here symbolizes a concept of the Lord.<p>The twelve gates (in the wall of the New Jerusalem) were twelve pearls: each individual gate was of one pearl. (<a href="3927/revelation_21_21.htm">Revelation 21:21</a>)<p>The gates of the New Jerusalem symbolize entrance into the New Church, and the entrance is made possible by concepts of goodness and truth from the Word.<p>Do not... cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and... tear you in pieces. (<a href="3927/matthew_7_6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>)<p>Swine symbolize people who care only for worldly wealth, and not for spiritual wealth, namely for concepts of goodness and truth from the Word.<p>Because Babylon symbolizes a religion that has cast out all concepts of goodness and truth from the Word, we are told concerning it:<p>The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over (Babylon), because no one buys their merchandise...: merchandise of gold and silver, precious stones, and pearls... (<a href="3927/revelation_18_11.htm">Revelation 18:11-12</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 727</h4><p>727. 'And pearls' signifies the cognitions of good and truth that are of the Word, with them. By 'pearls' in the spiritual sense are signified the cognitions of both celestial and spiritual good and truth that are derived from the Word, specifically from the sense of its letter; and because 'pearls' signify those cognitions, therefore they are named after the 'purple and scarlet' and the 'gold and precious stone.' The same cognitions are signified by 'pearls' in these passages:<p>The kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one precious pearl, going away sold all that he had, and bought it. <a href="3927/matthew_13_45.htm">Matthew 13:45-46</a>.<p>By this the cognition of the Lord is signified.<p>The twelve gates of the wall of the New Jerusalem were twelve pearls, each one of the gates was one pearl. <a href="3927/revelation_21_21.htm">Revelation 21:21</a>.<p>'The gates of the New Jerusalem' signify entering into the New Church, and the entering is effected by means of cognitions of good and truth derived from the Word.<p>Cast not your pearls before swine, lest they trample on them with their feet and tear you to pieces. <a href="3927/matthew_7_6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>.<p>By 'swine' are signified those who love only worldly wealth, and not the spiritual wealth consisting of cognitions of good and truth derived from the Word. Because by 'Babylon' is signified the form of religion by which the cognitions of good and truth derived from the Word have been rejected, it is said of her:<p>The merchants of the land shall weep and mourn over Babylon, because no one is buying their merchandise, merchandise of gold and silver, of precious stone and pearls, <a href="3927/revelation_18_1.htm">Revelation 18</a>:[<a href="3927/revelation_18_11.htm">11</a>,] <a href="3927/revelation_18_12.htm">12</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 727</h4><p>727. And pearls, signifies the knowledges of good and truth which are of the Word with them. By "pearls," in the spiritual sense, are signified the knowledges of good and truth both celestial and spiritual which are from the Word, particularly from the sense of its letter; and because "pearls" signify those knowledges, they are therefore named after "purple and scarlet," and after "gold and precious stones." The same knowledges are signified by pearls in the following passages:<p>The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a merchant seeking beautiful pearls; who, when he had found one precious pearl, went and sold all that he had, and bought it, (<a href="3927/matthew_13_45.htm">Matthew 13:45-46</a>).<p>By this is signified knowledge concerning the Lord.<p>The twelve gates of the wall of the New Jerusalem were twelve pearls, everyone of the gates was one pearl, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_21.htm">Revelation 21:21</a>).<p>"The gates of The New Jerusalem" signify introduction into the New Church, and introduction is effected by the knowledges of good and truth from the Word.<p>Neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and rend you, (<a href="3927/matthew_7_6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>).<p>By "swine" are signified they who only love worldly riches, and not spiritual riches, which are the knowledges of good and truth from the Word. Because by "Babylon" is signified that religious persuasion by which all the knowledges of good and truth derived from the Word were rejected, it is said of her:<p>And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over Babylon, for no one buyeth their merchandise; the merchandise of gold and silver, of precious stone and of pearls, (<a href="3927/revelation_18_11.htm">Revelation 18:11-12</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 727 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>727. "Et margaritis," significat cognitiones boni et veri, quae sunt Verbi, apud illos. Per "margaritas" in Sensu spirituali, significantur cognitiones boni et veri tam caelestis quam spiritualis, quae ex Verbo sunt, in specie ex Sensu literae ejus; et quia "margaritae" significant illas cognitiones, ideo nominantur post "purpuram et coccinum," ac post "aurum et lapidem pretiosum." Eaedem cognitiones significantur per "margaritas" in his locis: <p>"Simile est Regnum Caelorum negotiatori quaerenti pulchras Margaritas, qui cum invenisset unam pretiosam Margaritam, abiens vendidit omnia quae habuit, et emit illam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_727/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_13_45-46" target=_top>Matthaeus 13:45-46</a>);<p>per hanc significatur cognitio de Domino. <p>"Duodecim portae" Muri Novae Hierosolymae "duodecim Margaritae unaquaevis portarum erat una Margarita," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_727/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_21" target=_top>Apocalypsis 21:21</a>);<p>"portae Novae Hierosolymae" significant introitum in Novam Ecclesiam, ac introitus fit per cognitiones boni et veri ex Verbo. <p>"Ne projicite Margaritas vestras ante porcos, ne forte conculcent eas pedibus, et lacerent vos," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_727/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_7_6" target=_top>Matthaeus 7:6</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>per "porcos" significantur qui solum opes mundanas amant, et non opes spirituales, quae sunt cognitiones boni et veri ex Verbo. Quia per "Babylonem" significatur Religiosum, a quo omnes cognitiones boni et veri ex Verbo projectae sunt, dicitur de illa, <p>"Mercatores terrae flebunt et plangent super Babylone, quod merces eorum nemo emat, merces auri et argenti, lapidis pretiosi, et Margaritae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_727/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_18_1-24" target=_top>Apocalypsis 18</a>:(<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_727/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_18_11" target=_top>11</a>) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_727/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_18_12" target=_top>12</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Matth. pro "Luc." </p>
