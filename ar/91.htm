<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>91.“你要写信给士每拿教会的天使说”表写给并涉及那些在生活上处于良善，在教义上处于虚假之人。这些人由“士每拿教会”来表示，这一点从写给教会的这些话明显可知，不过，这些话当照着灵义来理解。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 91</h4><p>91. "And to the angel of the church of the people of Smyrna write." (<a href="3927/revelation_2_8.htm">2:8</a>) This symbolically means, to people and concerning people who as to life are engaged in good endeavors, but as to doctrine are caught up in falsities.<p>That people of this character are meant by the church of the people of Smyrna is apparent from the letter addressed to it, understood in its spiritual meaning. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 91</h4><p>91. [verse 8] 'And to the Angel of the Church of the Smyrnaeans write' signifies to and concerning those who as to life are in goods, but as to doctrine are in untruths. That these are understood by 'the Church of the Smyrnaeans' is plain by virtue of the things written to it, understood in the spiritual sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 91</h4><p>91. Verse 8. And unto the angel of the church of Smyrna write, signifies to those and concerning those, who are in goods as to life, but in falsities as to doctrine. That these are meant by "the church of Smyrna," is clear from the things written to it when understood in the spiritual sense. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 91 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>91. (Vers. 8.) "Et Angelo Ecclesiae Smyrnaeorum scribe," significat ad illos et de illis qui in bonis quoad vitam sunt, sed in falsis quoad doctrinam. - Quod illi per "Ecclesiam Smyrnaeorum" intelligantur, patet ex scriptis ad illam in Sensu spirituali intellectis. </p>
