<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第741节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>741.“但他们一时之间，要和兽同得权柄与王一样”表圣言在他们当中有能力，他们凭圣言仿佛处于它的神性真理。“和兽同得权柄”表示与圣言一起有能力，因而圣言在他们当中有能力，他们凭圣言有能力。“得权柄”表示强大，“兽”表示圣言（<a href="723.htm">723</a>节）；“与王一样”表示他们仿佛处于源自圣言的神性真理；“王”表示那些处于源自圣言的神性真理之人，抽象来说，表示圣言的神性真理（<a href="20.htm">20</a>，<a href="664.htm">664</a>，<a href="704.htm">704</a>，<a href="740.htm">740</a>节）；“一时之间”表一段时间，以及在某种程度上。由此明显可知，“他们一时之间，要和兽同得权柄与王一样”表示圣言在他们当中有能力，他们通过圣言有能力，仿佛处于圣言的神性真理。之所以说这些事，是因为他们圣言是神性的默示，教会凭圣言而成为教会。但他们至今仍未从圣言汲取神性真理，只吸收了这些一般真理，即：要唯独敬拜神，不可拜任何人像神一样；赐给彼得的权柄本身并非神性，打开和关闭天堂是神性，这神性不在任何人自己的能力里面。他们凭圣言确认这些事；不过，在那些没有听过圣言的人面前，他们凭理性来确认，而理性通过不断出于天堂的流注被赋予每一个想要处于真理的人。按照主的圣治（或天命），他们不再进一步发展，也不再从圣言汲取信仰和生命，因为他们仍于外在，或形式上依附于天主教；免得真理与虚假混杂在一起，从而产生内在冲突，如同发酵产生干扰</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 741</h4><p>741. "But receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast." This symbolically means that the Word has force with Roman Catholics in France, and through the Word they prevail, as though they possessed its Divine truths.<p>To receive authority with the beast means, symbolically, to prevail with the Word, thus that the Word has force with them, and through the Word they prevail. To receive authority means, symbolically, to prevail, and the beast symbolizes the Word (no. <a href="723.htm">723</a>). "As kings" means, symbolically, as though they possessed Divine truths from the Word. Kings symbolize people who possess Divine truths from the Word, and abstractly, the Divine truths themselves in it (nos. <a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="664.htm">664</a>, <a href="704.htm">704</a>, <a href="740.htm">740</a>). One hour means, symbolically, for a time, and also in some measure.<p>It is apparent from this that the ten kings receiving authority as kings for one hour with the beast means symbolically that the Word has force with Roman Catholics in France, and through the Word they prevail, as though they possessed its Divine truths.<p>We say this because Roman Catholics in France acknowledge that the Word is Divinely inspired, and thus that the church is a church because of the Word. But still they do not as yet draw Divine truths from it beyond these general ones, that the God alone is to be worshiped, and no man as God, that the authority granted to Peter is not in itself Divine, and yet that to open and close heaven is a Divine work, which does not lie within the power of any man. They confirm these truths in themselves by appeal to the Word, but in the presence of others who do not listen to the Word, by appeal to the rationality that by a continual influx from heaven exists in everyone who wishes to possess truths.<p>It is of the Lord's Divine providence that Roman Catholics in France do not go further and draw doctrines of faith and life from the Word, because in outward aspects and forms they still adhere to the Roman Catholic religion. It is to keep them from commingling truth and falsity, and so from an inner struggle arising, like a kind of ferment that produces a state of agitation. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 741</h4><p>741. 'But they receive authority as kings one hour with the beast' signifies that the Word has influence with them, and they have influence by means of the Word, as if they were in its Divine Truths. By 'to receive authority with the beast' is signified to have influence together with the Word, thus that the Word has influence with them, and they have influence by means of the Word. By 'to receive authority' is signified to have influence, and by 'the beast' is signified the Word (<a href="723.htm">723</a>). By 'as kings' is signified as if they were in Divine truths out of the Word. That by 'kings' are signified those who are in Divine truths out of the Word, and abstractly the Divine Truths there [may be seen] (<a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="664.htm">664</a>, <a href="704.htm">704</a>, <a href="740.htm">740</a>). By 'one hour' is signified for some time and also in some measure. It is plain from these things that by 'they receive authority as kings one hour with the beast' is signified that the Word has influence with them, and they have influence by means of the Word, as if they were in its Divine Truths. These things have been said because they acknowledge that the Word is Divinely inspired, and consequently that the Church is a Church out of the Word. Nevertheless up till now they do not draw Divine Truths out of it, save only these general ones: that the Only God is to be worshipped, and not any man as God; and that the authority given to Peter is not in itself Divine, and that yet it is Divine to open and shut heaven, which is not in a man's own power. They confirm these things with themselves out of the Word; but before others, who do not hear the Word, they confirm them out of the rationality that, as a result of a continual influx given out of heaven, is with everyone who wishes to be in truths. Because in external or formal things they still cohere with the Roman Catholic form of religion it is of the Lord's Divine Providence that they make no further progress and do not draw doctrinal tenets of faith and life out of the Word, lest they should mix truth and untruth together, and in consequence an interior struggle should arise, which is like a fermentation that causes disturbance. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 741</h4><p>741. But they receive authority as kings one hour with the beast, signifies that the Word has power with them, and they by the Word, as if they were in its Divine truths. By "receiving authority with the beast" is signified to have power together with the Word, and thus that the Word has power with them, and they by means of the Word. By "receiving authority" is signified to be strong, and by "the beast," the Word is signified, (<a href="723.htm">723</a>); by "as kings" is signified as if they were in Divine truths from the Word. That by "kings" are signified those who are in Divine truths from the Word, and abstractly the Divine truths therein, (<a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="664.htm">664</a>, <a href="704.htm">704</a>, <a href="740.htm">740</a>); by "one hour" is signified for some time, and also in some degree. From these things it is manifest that by "their receiving power as kings one hour with the beast," is signified that the Word has power with them, and they through the Word, as if they were in its Divine truths. These things are said, because they acknowledge that the Word is divinely inspired, and hence that the church is a church from the Word. But still they do not as yet draw Divine truths from it, except these general ones: that God alone is to be worshiped, and not any man like God; and that the authority given to Peter is not in itself Divine, and yet that it is Divine to open and shut heaven, which is not in any man's own power. These things they confirm in themselves from the Word; but before others, who do not hear the Word, they do it from rationality, which is given by continual influx out of heaven to everyone who wishes to be in truths. That they do not progress further, and draw the doctrinals of faith and life from the Word, is of the Lord's Divine Providence, because they still adhere in externals, or in formalities, to the Roman Catholic religious persuasion; lest truth and falsity should be mixed together, and thence an interior strife should arise, which is like fermentation that produces disturbance. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 741 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>741. "Sed potestatem tanquam Reges unam horam accipiunt cum Bestia," significat quod Verbum apud illos valeat, et illi per Verbum, sicut in Divinis veris ejus essent. -Per "accipere potestatem cum Bestia" significatur una valere cum Verbo, ita quod Verbum apud illos valeat, ac illi per Verbum valeant; per "potestatem accipere" significatur valere, et per "Bestiam" significatur Verbum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_741/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_723" target=_top>723</a>); per "tanquam reges," significatur sicut in Divinis veris ex Verbo essent; quod per "reges" significentur qui in Divinis veris ex Verbo sunt, et abstracte Divina Vera ibi (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_741/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_20" target=_top>20</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_741/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_664" target=_top>664</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_741/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_704" target=_top>704</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_741/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_740" target=_top>740</a>); per "unam horam" significatur aliquamdiu, et quoque aliquantum. Ex his patet, quod per "potestatem tanquam reges unam horam accipiunt cum Bestia," significetur quod Verbum apud illos valeat, et illi per Verbum, sicut in Divinis veris ejus essent. Haec dicta sunt, quia agnoscunt quod Verbum sit Divinitus inspiratum, et inde quod Ecclesia sit Ecclesia ex Verbo: sed usque Divina Vera ex illo non adhuc hauriunt, modo haec communia: quod Solus Deus colendus sit, et quod non aliquis homo sicut Deus; et quod potestas Petro data non in se sit Divina, et quod tamen Divinum sit aperire et claudere Caelum, quod non in hominis propria potestate est. Haec confirmant apud se ex Verbo; sed coram aliis, qui non audiunt Verbum, ex rationalitate, quae apud unumquemvis, qui in veris vult esse, ex continuo influxu e Caelo datur. Quod non ulterius progrediantur, et ex Verbo hauriant doctrinalia fidei et vitae, est ex Divina Domini Providentia, quia in externis seu formalibus adhuc cohaerent cum Religioso Catholico Romano; ne verum et falsum commisceantur, et inde luctatio interior, quae est sicut fermentatio quae turbat, exoriatur. </p>
