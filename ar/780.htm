<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第780节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>780.“牲口，羊”表他们不再拥有出于教会的外在或属世良善和真理的敬拜，因为他们的敬拜里面丝毫没有与此处所提及的事物相对应之物。</p><p>这与前面（<a href="777.htm">777</a>，<a href="778.htm">778</a>节）的解释很相似；不同之处在于：那里的事物表示属灵的的良善与真理，并属天的良善与真理，而此处的事物表示属世的良善与真理；至它们之间的区别（参看<a href="773.htm">773</a>节）。“牲口，羊”表示由公牛、牛犊、公山羊、绵羊、小山羊、公绵羊、母山羊、羊羔等构成的祭物。“牲口”是指公牛和牛犊，“羊”是指小山羊、公山羊、母山羊、羊羔；祭物是敬拜的外在，也被称为敬拜的属世之物。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 780</h4><p>780. "Cattle, and sheep." This symbolically means that these Roman Catholics no longer have any worship that springs from the church's external or natural goods and truths, because they have nothing inwardly in their worship that corresponds to the aforesaid things.<p>This statement is similar to ones explained in numbers 777, 778 above, the difference being that the valuables there were spiritual goods and truths and celestial goods and truths, while here they are natural goods and truths. The difference between these may be seen in no. <a href="773.htm">773</a> above.<p>Cattle and sheep symbolize the sacrifices that were made by offering bulls, calves, male goats, sheep, kids, rams, female goats, and lambs. Bulls and calves are meant by cattle, and kids, rams, goats and lambs by sheep. Moreover, the sacrifices were outward shows of worship, which are also called the natural expressions of worship. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 780</h4><p>780. 'And beasts of burden and sheep' signifies that they no longer have a worship out of external or natural goods and truths of the Church because they do not have anything inwardly in the worship that corresponds to the things named above. These things are similar to those that have been expounded above (<a href="777.htm">777-778</a>), with the difference that there they are spiritual goods and truths and celestial goods and truths, but here natural goods and truths, concerning the distinction of which <a href="774.htm">774</a> above may be seen. By 'beasts of burden and sheep' are signified the sacrifices that were made with (per) oxen, bullocks, he-goats, sheep, kids, rams, she-goats and lambs. The oxen and bullocks are understood by 'beasts of burden' and the kids, rams, she-goats and lambs by 'sheep'; and the sacrifices were the external things of worship that are also called natural worship. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 780</h4><p>780. And beasts of burden, and sheep, signifies that they no longer have worship from the external or natural goods and truths of the church, because they have not anything within their worship which corresponds to the above mentioned things. This is similar to the things explained above, (<a href="777.htm">777</a>, <a href="778.htm">778</a>); with the difference that there are signified spiritual goods and truths, and celestial goods and truths, but here natural goods and truths; for the distinction between which, see above, (<a href="773.htm">773</a>). By "beasts of burden and sheep" are signified the sacrifices which were made with oxen, bullocks, he-goats, sheep, kids, rams, she-goats, lambs. Oxen and bullocks are meant by "beasts of burden," and kids, rams, she-goats, and lambs, by "sheep," and sacrifices were the externals of worship, which are also called the natural things of worship. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 780 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>780. "Et jumenta et oves," significat quod non illis amplius sit cultus ex bonis et veris Ecclesiae externis seu naturalibus, quia non aliquid intus in cultu habent quod supra nominatis correspondet.--Haec similia sunt cum illis quae supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_780/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_777" target=_top>777</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_780/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_778" target=_top>778</a>) explicata sunt, cum differentia quod ibi sint bona et vera spiritualia ac bona et vera caelestia, hic autem bona et vera naturalia, de quorum discrimine videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_780/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_773" target=_top>773</a>). Per "jumenta et oves" significantur sacrificia quae fiebant per boves, juvencos, hircos, oves, haedos, arietes, capras, agnos. Boves et juvenci intelliguntur per jumenta; ac haedi, arietes, caprae, agni, per oves; et sacrificia erant externa cultus, quae etiam naturalia cultus vocantur. </p>
