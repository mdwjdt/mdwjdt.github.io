<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第355节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>355.“玛拿西支派中受印的有一万二千”表那些将要属于主的新天堂和新教会之人所具有的事奉和行动的意愿。有三样事物依次相随，即：对主之爱，智慧和功用，如前所述（<a href="352.htm">352</a>节）；此处也一样，即相爱、认知或领悟、意愿或行动；这三者同样构成一体，因此若其中一个缺失，另外二个就什么也不是；以行动来事奉的意愿就是结果，因而是终端，前面二者在它里面并共存。“玛拿西”之所以具有这种含义，是因为玛拿西和以法莲的父亲约瑟表示教会的属灵之物；教会的属灵之物就是意愿的良善，和同时认知的真理；正因如此，“玛拿西”表示教会的意志（voluntary），“以法莲”表示教会的智识（intellectual）。“玛拿西”之所以表示教会的意志（voluntary），是因为“以法莲”表示教会的智识，这一点明显可见于何西阿书，那里频繁提及以法莲；“玛拿西”因表示教会的意志，故也表示行动，因为意愿是一切行动的努力，哪里有努力，一旦有可能，哪里就有行动。“玛拿西”数处被提及，如他出生时（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创41.50.htm">41:50</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创41.52.htm">52</a>）；雅各接纳他以取代西缅（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创48.3.htm">48:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创48.5.htm">5</a>），并为他祝福（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创48.15.htm">48:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创48.16.htm">16</a>）；摩西为他祝福（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.17.htm">33:17</a>）；还有以赛亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.17.htm">9:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.21.htm">21</a>），诗篇（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗60.7.htm">60:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗80.2.htm">80:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗108.8.htm">108:8</a>）。由此在某种程度上可以看出，“玛拿西”表示教会的意志。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 355</h4><p>355. Of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand were sealed. This symbolizes a will to serve and to put into practice, also in those people who will be part of the New Heaven and of the Lord's New Church.<p>There are three things that follow in order: love toward the Lord, wisdom, and useful endeavor, as we said in no. <a href="352.htm">352</a> above. So again here: mutual love, understanding or perception, and will or action. These also form a unit, so that if one is missing, the other two have no reality. A will to serve, combined with action, constitute the effect, thus the final element, in which the two prior ones are present and coexist.<p>Manasseh has this symbolism because Joseph, who was the father of Manasseh and Ephraim, symbolizes the spiritual component of the church, and the spiritual component of the church is goodness of will and at the same time truth in the intellect. Manasseh consequently symbolizes the volitional component of the church, and Ephraim its intellectual component.<p>Manasseh symbolizes the volitional component of the church because Ephraim symbolizes its intellectual component, as is clearly apparent in Hosea, where Ephraim is so often mentioned. And because Manasseh symbolizes the volitional component of the church, he also symbolizes action or practice; for will is the impetus in every action, and where impetus exists, there action takes place whenever possible.<p>Manasseh is mentioned in several places, as when he was born (<a href="3927/genesis_41_50.htm">Genesis 41:50-52</a>); when Jacob took him in place of Simeon (<a href="3927/genesis_48_3.htm">Genesis 48:3-5</a>), and blessed him (<a href="3927/genesis_48_15.htm">Genesis 48:15-16</a>); and when Moses blessed him (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>). He is mentioned as well also in <a href="3927/isaiah_9_19.htm">Isaiah 9:19-21</a>, and <a href="3927/psalms_60_7.htm">Psalms 60:7</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_80_2.htm">80:2</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_108_8.htm">108:8</a>. From these places it can in some measure be seen that Manasseh means the volitional component of the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 355</h4><p>355. 'Out of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand sealed' signifies the will of being serviceable and of action, also with those who will belong to the New Heaven and the Lord's New Church. There are three things that follow in order: love directed to the Lord, wisdom, and use, as stated above (<a href="352.htm">352</a>). So also here, mutual love, understanding or perception, and will or action. These also make one, even to the extent that if one is wanting the remaining two are not anything. The will of being serviceable with action is the effect, thus the ultimate, in which the two prior things are and co-exist. 'Manasseh' has this signification because Joseph, who was the father of Manasseh and Ephraim, signifies the spiritual of the Church, and the spiritual of the Church is the good of the will and at the same time the truth of the understanding. This is why 'Manasseh' signifies the voluntary of the Church, while 'Ephraim' signifies the intellectual thereof. 'Manasseh' signifies the voluntary of the Church because 'Ephraim' signifies the intellectual, as is manifestly plain in Hosea, where Ephraim is named so many times; and because 'Manasseh' signifies the voluntary of the Church, it also signifies action, for the will is the endeavour of every action, and where there is endeavour there is action so long as it is possible. 'Manasseh' is named in some places, as when he was born (<a href="3927/genesis_41_50.htm">Genesis 41:50-52</a>); when he was accepted by Jacob instead of Simeon as it were (<a href="3927/genesis_48_3.htm">Genesis 48:3-5</a>); and was blessed by him (<a href="3927/genesis_48_15.htm">Genesis 48:15-16</a>); and by Moses (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>); and moreover (<a href="3927/isaiah_9_19.htm">Isaiah 9:19-21</a> [H.B. <a href="3927/isaiah_9_18.htm">18-20</a>]; <a href="3927/psalms_60_7.htm">Psalms 60:7</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_60_9.htm">9</a>]; <a href="3927/psalms_80_2.htm">Psalms 80:2</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_80_3.htm">3</a>]; <a href="3927/psalms_108_8.htm">Psalms 108:8</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_108_9.htm">9</a>]; from which it can be seen in some measure that by 'Manasseh' the voluntary of the Church is understood. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 355</h4><p>355. Of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand, signifies the will of serving and of action, with those also who will be of the Lord's New Heaven and New Church. There are three things which follow in order: love to the Lord, wisdom, and use, as was said above, (<a href="352.htm">352</a>); so also here, mutual love, understanding or perception, and will or action; these likewise make one, so that if one of them is wanting, the other two are not anything; the will of serving with the action, is the effect, thus the ultimate, in which the two former are and co-exist. The reason why "Manasseh" has this signification, is, because Joseph, who was the father of Manasseh and Ephraim, signifies the spiritual of the church; and the spiritual of the church is the good of the will, and at the same time the truth of the understanding; hence it is that "Manasseh" signifies the voluntary of the church, and "Ephraim" its intellectual. "Manasseh" signifies the voluntary of the church, because "Ephraim" signifies its intellectual, as appears manifestly in Hosea, where Ephraim is so frequently mentioned; and as "Manasseh" signifies the voluntary of the church, he also signifies act, for the will is the endeavor of every act, and where there is endeavor, there is action, when it is possible. Mention is made of "Manasseh" in several places, as when he was born, (<a href="3927/genesis_41_50.htm">Genesis 41:50-52</a>); when he was accepted of Jacob as if instead of Simeon, (<a href="3927/genesis_48_3.htm">Genesis 48:3-5</a>) and blessed by him, (<a href="3927/genesis_48_15.htm">Genesis 48:15-16</a>); and by Moses, (<a href="3927/deuteronomy_33_17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>) and moreover in <a href="3927/isaiah_9_18.htm">Isaiah 9:18-20</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_60_7.htm">Psalms 60:7</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_80_2.htm">80:2</a>; <a href="3927/psalms_108_8.htm">108:8</a>. From which it may in some measure be seen, that by "Manasseh" is signified the voluntary of the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 355 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>355. "Et tribu Menassis duodecim millia signati," significat Voluntatem inserviendi et actus, etiam apud illos qui e Novo Caelo et e Nova Ecclesia Domini erunt. - Sunt tria, quae sequuntur ordine, Amor in Dominum, Sapientia, et Usus, ut supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_355/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_352" target=_top>352</a>) dictum est; ita quoque hic, Amor mutuus Intellectus seu perceptio, ac Voluntas seu actus; haec quoque unum faciunt, adeo ut si unum desit, duo reliqua non sint aliquid; voluntas inserviendi cum actu, est effectus, ita ultimum, in quo duo priora sunt et coexistunt. Quod "Menasse" hoc significet, est quia Josephus, qui erat pater Menassis et Ephraimi, significat spirituale Ecclesiae, et spirituale Ecclesiae est bonum voluntatis, et simul verum intellectus; inde est quod "Menasse" significet Voluntarium Ecclesiae, ac "Ephraim" Intellectuale ejus. Quod "Menasse" significet voluntarium Ecclesiae, est quia "Ephraim" significat intellectuale, ut manifeste patet apud Hoscheam, ubi Ephraim toties nominatur; et quia "Menasse" significat voluntarium Ecclesiae, etiam significat actus, nam voluntas est conatus omnis actus, et ubi conatus ibi actus, dum possibile est. Menasse nominatur in aliquibus locis, <p>Ut dum natus, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_41_50-52" target=_top>Genesis 41:50-52</a>);<p>Cum a Jacobo acceptus quasi pro Simeone, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_48_3-5" target=_top>Genesis 48:3-5</a>);<p>Et benedictus ab illo, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_genesis_48_15-16" target=_top>Genesis 48:15-16</a>);<p>Et a Mose, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_deuteronomy_33_17" target=_top>Deuteronomius 33:17</a>).<p>(Et praeterea, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_9_18-20" target=_top>Esaias 9:18-20</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_9_11" target=_top>11</a>); <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_60_9" target=_top>Psalm 60:9</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_60_7" target=_top>7</a>); <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_80_3" target=_top>Psalm 80:3</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_80_2" target=_top>2</a>); <sup>1</sup><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_108_9" target=_top>Psalm 108:9</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_355/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_108_8" target=_top>8</a>).) <p>Ex quibus aliquantum videri potest, quod per "Menassen" voluntarium Ecclesiae intelligatur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;lxxx. pro "lxx." </p>
