<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>36.“当主日，我在灵里”表那时由神性流注所产生的属灵状态。“我在灵里”表约翰在异象里时所在的属灵状态，下文会论述这种状态。“当主日”表那里从主而来的流注，此日有主临在，因为这日是神圣的。由此可见，“当主日，我在灵里”表那时由神性流注所产生的属灵状态。对于众先知书，我们读到，他们“在灵里”或“在异象中”，还有耶和华的话临到他们。当在灵里或异象中时，他们不在肉身，而是在他们的灵里。在这种状态下，他们看见诸如天堂里的那类事物。可当圣言临到他们时，他们是在肉身听见耶和华说话。先知的这两种状态要仔细区分。在异象的状态下，他们的灵眼被打开了，而肉眼被关闭了，这时他们听见天使说的话，或者耶和华通过天使说的话，也看见天上向他们所展现的事物。有时，他们觉得自己从一个地方被提到另一个地方，肉身却原地未动。</p><p>约翰写启示录时就处于这种状态；以西结、撒迦利亚、但以理有时也处于这种状态，此时经上说他们“在异象中”或说“在灵里”；因为以西结说：</p><p>灵将我举起，在神的异象，神的灵中将我带进迦勒底地，到被掳的人那里；我所见的异象就离我上升去了。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结11.1.htm">11:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结11.24.htm">24</a>）</p><p>还说灵将他举起，他便听见身后有震动轰轰的声音等（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.12.htm">3:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.24.htm">24</a>）。又说灵将他举起到天与地之间，在神的异象中，带他到耶路撒冷，并让他看到可憎的事（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.3.htm">8:3</a>等）。同样，当以西结看见四活物，就是基路伯（以西结书1章和10章）时，以及当看见新地和新殿，并天使量它们（以西结书40章至48章）时，他就在神的异象中或在灵里；经上说，他在神的异象中（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.2.htm">40:2</a>）；灵将他举起（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.5.htm">43:5</a>）。</p><p>撒迦利亚的情形也一样，当时有一位天使与他同在，他便看见一个骑马的人站在石榴树中间（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚1.8.htm">1:8</a>等）；看见四角，后来看见一人手拿准绳（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.1.htm">2:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.5.htm">5</a>等）；看见大祭司约书亚（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚3.1.htm">3:1</a>等）；看见灯台和两棵橄榄树（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚4.1.htm">4:1</a>等）；看见飞行的书卷和量器（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚5.1.htm">5:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚5.6.htm">6</a>）；又看见四辆车从两山中间出来，还有马（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚6.1.htm">6:1</a>等）。但以理也是在这种状态下看见四兽从海中上来（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.1.htm">7:1</a>等），看见公绵羊和公山羊争斗（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.1.htm">8:1</a>等）。他本人说自己是在异象中看到这些事物的（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.1.htm">7:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.2.htm">8:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.1.htm">10:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.7.htm">7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但10.8.htm">8</a>），也是在异象中看见了天使加百利（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.21.htm">9:21</a>）。</p><p>约翰也是如此，如他看见人子站在七灯台中间（启示录1章）；看见天上的宝座和那坐在宝座上的，以及宝座周围的四活物（启示录4章）；看见用七印封严的书卷（启示录5章）；看见四匹马从揭开的书卷中出来（启示录6章）；看见四位天使站在地的四角（启示录7章）；看见蝗虫从无底坑出来（启示录9章）；看见天使手里拿着小书卷，交给他吃（启示录10章）；听到七位天使吹号（启示录11章）；后来看见龙和那龙所逼迫的妇人，以及龙与米迦勒的争战（启示录12章）；后来看见两个兽上来，一个从海中上来，另一个从地中上来（启示录13章）；看见七位天使掌管末了的七灾（启示录15-16章）；看见大淫妇坐在朱红色兽上（启示录17-18章）；以后又看见一匹白马并坐在马上的（启示录19章）；最后看见一个新天新地，然后看见新耶路撒冷从天而降（启示录21-22）。约翰是“在灵里”和“异象中”看到这些事物的，这是他本人说的（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.10.htm">1:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.2.htm">4:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.17.htm">9:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.10.htm">21:10</a>）。“我看见”无论在哪个地方出现，都是这个意思。</p><p>从这些事明显可知，“在灵里”就是“在异象中”。当人灵的视觉被打开时，这种事就会发生。当灵的视觉被打开时，灵界的那些事物就显现眼前，就像尘世的事物显现在肉眼前一样清楚。凭借多年的亲身经历，我能证明这是千真万确的。主复活以后，门徒就是在这种状态下看见祂，故经上说：“他们的眼睛开了”（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.30.htm">24:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.31.htm">31</a>）。亚伯拉罕也是在这种状态下看见三位天使，和他们说话。夏甲、基甸、约书亚等人亦是在这种状态下看见耶和华的天使；以利沙的少年人同样在这种状态下看见满山有火车火马围绕以利沙；因为以利沙祷告说：耶和华啊，求你开这少年人的眼目，使他能看见。耶和华开他的眼目，他就看见。（列王纪下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下6.17.htm">6:17</a>）</p><p>但至于圣言，它不是在灵里或在异象中被启示的，而是主以活生生的声音晓谕先知的。所以经上从未说先知凭圣灵说话，而是说他们凭耶和华说话（参看《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》，<a href="../lord/53.htm">53</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 36</h4><p>36. I became in the spirit on the Lord's day. (<a href="3927/revelation_1_10.htm">1:10</a>) This symbolizes a spiritual state then owing to Divine influx.<p>"I became in the spirit" means, symbolically, a spiritual state, the state in which John was while he was experiencing the visions, and which we will take up in the following exposition. "On the Lord's day" symbolizes influx from the Lord then, for that day brings the Lord's presence, as it is a holy day.<p>Concerning the prophets we read that they were in the spirit or in vision, and that the Word came to them from Jehovah.<p>When they were in the spirit or in vision, they were not in the body, but in their spirit, a state in which they saw phenomena such as are found in heaven. But when the Word came to them, they were then in the body and heard Jehovah speaking.<p>These two states of the prophets must be properly distinguished. In the state of vision the eyes of their spirit were open and the eyes of their body closed; and they heard then what angels said, and what Jehovah said through angels, and also saw representations produced for them in heaven. Moreover, they sometimes seemed to themselves to be taken then from place to place, their body remaining where it was.</p><p>[2] This was the state in which John was when he wrote the book of Revelation, and the state sometimes experienced by Ezekiel, Zechariah, and Daniel. They also said that they were then in vision or in the spirit. For Ezekiel says,<p>The Spirit lifted me up... and brought me back into Chaldea, to those in captivity, in a vision (of God), in the spirit of God. (Thus) went up from me the vision that I had seen. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">24</a>)<p>He also says that the Spirit lifted him up, and he heard behind him an earthquake, and more (<a href="3927/ezekiel_3_12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_24.htm">24</a>). So, too, that the Spirit lifted him up between earth and heaven, that it brought him in visions of God to Jerusalem, and that he saw abominations (<a href="3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>f.). He was likewise in a vision of God or in the spirit when he saw the four living creatures, which were cherubim (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10</a>), as also when he saw a new earth and a new temple, and an angel measuring them (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_41_1.htm">41</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_42_1.htm">42</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_43_1.htm">43</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_44_1.htm">44</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_45_1.htm">45</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_46_1.htm">46</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_47_1.htm">47</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">48</a>). That he was then in the visions of God, he himself says (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>), and that the spirit lifted him up (<a href="3927/ezekiel_43_5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>).</p><p>[3] The same was the case with Zechariah, who had an angel with him at the time, when he saw a man riding a horse among the myrtle trees (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>ff.); when he saw the four horns, and then a man with a measuring line in his hand (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">2:1</a>ff.); when he saw Joshua the high priest (<a href="3927/zechariah_3_1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>ff.); when he saw the lampstand and two olive trees (<a href="3927/zechariah_4_1.htm">Zechariah 4:1</a>ff.); when he saw the flying scroll and the ephah (<a href="3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">6</a>); when he saw the four chariots coming from between two mountains, and the horses (<a href="3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a>ff.).<p>Daniel was in a like state when he saw the four beasts coming up from the sea (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a>ff.), and when he saw the combat between the ram and the male goat (<a href="3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8:1</a>ff.). He himself says that he saw these things in visions (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_10_7.htm">7-8</a>), and that the angel Gabriel appeared to him in a vision (<a href="3927/daniel_9_21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>).</p><p>[4] The same was the case with John, as when he saw the Son of Man in the midst of the seven lampstands (<a href="3927/revelation_1_1.htm">Revelation 1</a>), and finally, the new heaven and the new earth, and then the New Jerusalem coming down out of heaven (<a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">Revelation 21</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_22_1.htm">22</a>. John himself says that he saw these things in the spirit and in vision (<a href="3927/revelation_1_10.htm">1:10</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_4_2.htm">4:2</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_9_17.htm">9:17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_10.htm">21:10</a>). This, too, is meant by the statement, "I saw," everywhere it occurs in this book.</p><p>[5] It is clearly apparent from this that to be in the spirit is to be in a state of vision, which is brought about by an opening of the sight of a person's spirit; and when this is opened, phenomena found in the spiritual world are as clearly visible as those in the natural world are to the sight of the body.<p>The reality of this is something I can attest to from many years' experience.<p>The disciples were in this state when they saw the Lord after His resurrection, which is why are told that their eyes were opened (<a href="3927/luke_24_30.htm">Luke 24:30-31</a>).<p>Abraham was in a like state when he saw the three angels and spoke with them. <sup>1</sup><p>So, too, Hagar, Gideon, Joshua and others, when they saw angels of Jehovah. Likewise when Elisha's lad saw the mountain full of fiery chariots and horses all around Elisha, for Elisha prayed and said,<p>"Jehovah, open, I pray, his eyes that he may see." And Jehovah opened the eyes of the lad, and he saw. (<a href="3927/2-kings_6_17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>)<p>As regards the Word, however, it was not revealed in a state of the spirit or of vision, but the Lord dictated it to the prophets in an audible voice. Consequently we are nowhere told that the prophets spoke it from the Holy Spirit, but from Jehovah. See The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord, no. <a href="../lord/53.htm">53</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="3927/genesis_18_1.htm">Genesis 18</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 36</h4><p>36. [verse 10] 'I came to be in the spirit on the Lord's day' signifies the spiritual state then as a result of Divine influx. 'I came to be in the spirit' signifies the spiritual state in which he was while in the visions, concerning which state [something] follows. 'On the Lord's day' signifies influx from the Lord then, for on that day there is the presence of the Lord, because the day is holy. It is plain from these [considerations] that 'I came to be in the spirit on the Lord's day' signifies the spiritual state then as a result of Divine influx. Of the prophets we read that they were 'in the spirit' or 'in a vision,' also that the Word was delivered to them by Jehovah. When they were in the spirit or a vision they were not in the body but in their spirit, in which state they saw such things as are in heaven. But when the Word was delivered to them, then they were in the body and heard Jehovah speaking. These two states of the prophets are to be properly distinguished. In the state of vision the eyes of their spirit were opened and the eyes of their body closed, and they then heard things that angels spoke, or that Jehovah spoke through angels, and they also saw the things that were represented to them in heaven; and then sometimes they seemed to be carried from place to place, the body remaining in its own position.</p><p>[2] John was in this state when he wrote the Apocalypse; and sometimes also Ezekiel, Zechariah, and Daniel [were in it]; and then it is said that they were 'in a vision' or 'in the spirit'; for Ezekiel says:<p>The spirit took me up, and brought me back into Chaldea to the captivity, in a vision of God, in the spirit of God: so the vision that I had seen went up over me. <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">11:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">24</a>.<p>He also says that the spirit took him up, and he heard an earthquake behind him, and other things (<a href="3927/ezekiel_3_12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_24.htm">24</a>); also, that the spirit took him up between earth and heaven, brought him into Jerusalem in the visions of God, and he saw abominations (<a href="3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">8:3</a> seq.). He was in like manner in a vision of God or in the spirit, when he saw the four animals that were cherubs (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10</a>), as also when he saw the new land and the new temple, and an angel measuring them (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">40</a> to, <a href="3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">48</a>). He says that he was in the visions of God (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">40:2</a>), and that the spirit took him up (<a href="3927/ezekiel_43_5.htm">43:5</a>).</p><p>[3] A similar thing was effected in the case of Zechariah, in whom there was an angel at the time, when he saw the man riding among the myrtle trees (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a> seq).; when he saw four horns, and afterwards a man in whose hand was a measuring line (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a>; <a href="3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">2:1</a> seq. [H.B. <a href="3927/zechariah_2_5.htm">5</a> seq.]); when he saw Joshua the high priest (<a href="3927/zechariah_3_1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a> seq).; when he saw the lampstand and the two olive trees (<a href="3927/zechariah_4_1.htm">Zechariah 4:1</a> seq).; when he saw the flying roll and the ephah (<a href="3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">6</a>); and when he saw the four chariots coming out from between the two mountains, and the horses (<a href="3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a> seq.). Daniel was in a similar state when he saw the four beasts coming up out of the sea (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a> seq).; and when he saw the battle of the ram and the he-goat (<a href="3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8:1</a> seq.). He himself says that he saw these things in visions (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_10_7.htm">7-8</a>), and that the angel Gabriel appeared to him in a vision (<a href="3927/daniel_9_25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>).</p><p>[4] A similar thing was effected in the case of John, as when he saw the Son of Man in the midst of the seven lampstands (Revelation 1); when he saw the throne in heaven, and one sitting thereon, and four animals round about the throne (Revelation 4); when he saw the Book sealed with seven seals (Revelation 5); when he saw the four horses going forth out of the opened Book (Revelation 6); when he saw the four angels standing on the four corners of the land (Revelation 7); when he saw the locusts going forth out of the pit of the deep (Revelation 9); when be saw the angel in whose hand was the little book, which he gave him to eat (Revelation 10); when he heard the seven angels sounding with the trumpets ((Revelation 8, 9, 11); when he saw the dragon and the woman whom the dragon persecuted, and the battle of that dragon with Michael ((Revelation 12); and afterwards, the two beasts coming up, the one out of the sea, and the other out of the land ((Revelation 13); when he saw the seven angels having the seven last plagues (Revelation 15, 16); when he saw the harlot sitting upon the scarlet coloured beast (Revelation 17, 18); and afterwards a white horse and One sitting upon it (Revelation 19); and at last, the new heaven and the new land, and the New Jerusalem coming down then out of heaven (Revelation 21, 22). That John saw these things in 'the spirit' and in 'vision,' he himself says (<a href="3927/revelation_1_10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_4_2.htm">4:2</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_9_17.htm">9:17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_10.htm">21:10</a>). This is also understood by [the expression] 'I saw' wherever [it occurs] in his writings.</p><p>[5] It is quite plain from these things that to be 'in the spirit' is to be 'in vision,' and this is effected by means of an opening of the sight of a man's spirit. When this is opened, the things that are in the spiritual world appear just as clearly as do those that are before the sight of the body in the natural world. I can testify that it is so from many years experience. The disciples were in this state when they saw the Lord after the resurrection, and it is therefore said that 'their eyes were opened' (<a href="3927/luke_24_30.htm">Luke 24:30-31</a>). Abraham was in a similar state when he saw the three angels and spoke with them. Likewise Hagar, Gideon, Joshua and others when they saw angels of Jehovah. In like manner when Elisha's young man saw the mountain full of chariots and horses of fire round about Elisha, for:<p>Elisha prayed, and said, Jehovah, I pray Thee open his eyes that he may see, and Jehovah opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw. <a href="3927/2-kings_6_17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>.<p>As concerns the Word, however, this was not revealed in the state of 'the spirit' or 'in vision,' but it was dictated by the Lord to the prophets with a living voice. On account of this it is not anywhere said that they spoke the Word out of the Holy Spirit, but out of Jehovah. See <a href="../lord/53.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD 53</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 36</h4><p>36. Verse 10. I became in the spirit on the Lord's day, signifies a spiritual state then from Divine influx. "I became in the spirit," signifies the spiritual state in which he was when he was in visions, which state is treated of in what follows. "On the Lord's day," signifies influx then from the Lord; for on that day the Lord is present, because the day is holy. From which it is evident, that "I became in the spirit on the Lord's day," signifies a spiritual state then from Divine influx. Of the prophets we read that they were "in the spirit" or "in vision," also that the Word came to them from Jehovah. When they were in the spirit or in vision, they were not in the body, but in their spirit, in which state they saw such things as are in heaven; but when the Word came to them, then they were in the body, and heard Jehovah speaking. These two states of the prophets are to be carefully distinguished. In the state of vision the eyes of their spirit were opened, and the eyes of their body shut; and then they heard what the angels spoke; or what Jehovah spoke through the angels, and they also saw the things which were represented to them in heaven; and then they sometimes seemed to themselves to be carried from place to place, the body remaining in its place.</p><p>[2] In this state was John when he wrote Revelation; and sometimes also Ezekiel, Zechariah, and Daniel; and then it is said that they were "in vision," or "in the spirit;" for Ezekiel says:<p>The spirit took me up, and brought me back into Chaldea to the captivity in a vision of God, in the Spirit of God; thus the vision which I saw went up upon me, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">Ezek 11:1</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">24</a>).<p>It is said also that the spirit took him up, and he heard behind him an earthquake, and other things, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_3_12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_3_24.htm">24</a>); also that:<p>The spirit lifted him up between the earth and heaven, and brought him in the visions of God to Jerusalem, and he saw abominations, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>).<p>In like manner he was in a vision of God, or in the spirit, when he saw the four animals which were cherubs, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_1_10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a>); as also when he saw the new earth and the new temple, and the angel measuring them (Ezekiel 40-48); and it is said that he was in the visions of God, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>); and that the spirit took him up, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_43_5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>).</p><p>[3] The same was the case with Zechariah, with whom there was an angel at the time, when he saw the man riding among the myrtle trees, (<a href="3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>); when he saw four horns, and afterwards a man, in whose hand was a measuring line, (<a href="3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">Zechariah 2:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_2_5.htm">5</a> seq.); when he saw Joshua, the high priest, (<a href="3927/zechariah_3_1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a> seq.); when he saw the lampstand and the two olive trees, (<a href="3927/zechariah_4_1.htm">Zechariah 4:1</a>); when he saw the flying roll and the ephah, (<a href="3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>, <a href="3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">6</a>); and when he saw the four chariots coming out from between two mountains, and horses, (<a href="3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a>). In a similar state was Daniel; when he saw four beasts coming up out of the sea, (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a> seq.). And when he saw the battle of the ram and the he-goat, (<a href="3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8:1</a>). That he saw these things in visions, he himself said, (<a href="3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2</a>; <a href="3927/daniel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_10_7.htm">7-8</a>), and that the angel Gabriel was seen by him in a vision, (<a href="3927/daniel_9_21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>).</p><p>[4] It was the same with John; as when he saw the Son of man in the midst of the seven lampstands (Revelation 1); when he saw a throne in heaven, and Him that sat thereon, and four animals round about the throne (Revelation 4); when he saw the book sealed with seven seals (Revelation 5); when he saw the four horses going forth out of the book that was opened (Revelation 6); when he saw the four angels standing upon the four corners of the earth (Revelation 7); when he saw the locusts going forth out of the bottomless pit (Revelation 9); when he saw the angel in whose hand was a little book, which he gave him to eat (Revelation 10); when he heard the seven angels sound with their trumpets (Revelation 11); when he saw the dragon, and the woman whom the dragon persecuted, and the combat of the latter with Michael (Revelation 12); and afterwards, two beasts coming up, one out of the sea, and the other out of the earth (Revelation 13); when he saw the seven angels having the seven last plagues (Revelation 15-16); when he saw the harlot sitting upon the scarlet beast (Revelation 17-18); and afterwards, a white horse, and One sitting thereon (Revelation 19); and lastly, a new heaven and a new earth, and then the New Jerusalem coming down out of heaven (Revelation 21-22). That John saw these things "in the spirit," and "in vision," he himself says, (<a href="3927/revelation_1_10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_4_2.htm">4:2</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_9_17.htm">9:17</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_21_10.htm">21:10</a>); this also is meant by "I saw" wherever it occurs.</p><p>[5] From these things it is evident that to be "in the spirit" is to be "in vision;" which is effected by the opening of the sight of man's spirit; which, when it is opened, the things which are in the spiritual world appear as clearly as the things which are in the natural world appear before the sight of the body. I can testify that it is so, from the experience of many years. In this state the disciples were when they saw the Lord after His resurrection, wherefore it is said that: "Their eyes were opened" (<a href="3927/luke_24_30.htm">Luke 24:30-31</a>). Abraham was in a similar state when he saw the three angels, and spoke with them. So were Hagar, Gideon, Joshua, and others, when they saw the angels of Jehovah; and, in like manner, the boy of Elisha, when he saw the mountain full of chariots and horses of fire round about Elisha; for:<p>Elisha prayed and said, Jehovah, I pray, open his eyes that he may see; and Jehovah opened the eyes of the boy, and he saw, (<a href="3927/2-kings_6_17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>).<p>But as to the Word, it was not revealed in a state of the spirit or in vision, but was dictated to the prophets by the Lord by the living voice; therefore, it is nowhere said that they spoke it from the Holy Spirit, but from Jehovah; see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord, (<a href="53.htm">53</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 36 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>36. (Vers. 10.) "Factus sum in Spiritu in Dominica die," significat statum spiritualem tunc ex Divino influxu. -"Factus Sum in Spiritu," significat statum spiritualem, in quo fuit dum in visionibus, de quo statu sequitur; "in Dominica die," significat a Domino tunc influxum, in die enim illa est praesentia Domini, quia dies sanctus est: ex quibus patet, quod "factus sim in Spiritu in Dominica die," significet statum spiritualem tunc ex Divino influxu. De Prophetis legitur, quod fuerint "in Spiritu" aut "in Visione," tum quod Verbum factum sit ad illos a Jehovah: cum fuerunt "in Spiritu" seu "Visione," non fuerunt in corpore, sed in suo Spiritu, in quo statu viderunt talia quae in Caelo sunt; cum autem Verbum factum est ad illos, tunc fuerunt in corpore, et audiverunt Jehovam loquentem: hi bini status Prophetarum probe distinguendi sunt; in Statu Visionis aperti sunt oculi spiritus eorum, et clausi oculi Corporis eorum, et tunc audiverunt quae Angeli locuti sunt, seu quae Jehovah per Angelos, et quoque viderunt quae sibi repraesentata sunt in Caelo; et tunc quandoque sibi visi sunt auferri e loco in locum, corpore manente in suo: in hoc statu fuit Johannes, cum scripsit Apocalypsin; et quandoque etiam Ezechiel, Sacharias et Daniel; et tunc dicitur quod essent "in Visione" aut "in Spiritu;" dicit enim Ezechiel, <p>"Spiritus sustulit me, et reduxit me in Chaldaeam ad captivitatem in Visione Dei, in Spiritu Dei;

Ex his manifeste patet, quod esse "in spiritu" sit esse "in visione," quae fit per aperitionem visus Spiritus hominis; qui cum aperitur, apparent illa quae in Mundo Spirituali sunt, tam clare quemadmodum coram visu Corporis illa quae in Mundo Naturali sunt. Quod ita sit, ab experientia multorum annorum testari possum. In hoc statu fuerunt Discipuli cum viderunt Dominum post resurrectionem; quare dicitur quod "Aperti sint oculi illorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_36/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_24_30-31" target=_top>Luca 24:30-31</a>).<p>In simili statu fuit Abraham, cum vidit tres Angelos, et locutus est cum illis. Similiter Hagar, Guideon, Joschua, et alii, cum viderunt Angelos Jehovae: similiter cum puer Elisaei vidit Montem plenum curribus et equis igneis circum Elisaeum, <p>"Oravit enim Elisaeus, et dixit, Jehovah, Aperi quaeso oculos ejus ut videat, et aperuit Jehovah oculos pueri, et vidit," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_36/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_2-kings_6_17" target=_top>2 Regnum 6:17</a>).<p>Quod autem Verbum attinet, id non revelatum est in statu Spiritus seu in Visione, sed a Domino viva voce dictatum est Prophetis; quare nullibi dicitur, quod locuti sint illud ex Spiritu Sancto, sed ex Jehovah; videatur Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_36/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_53" target=_top>53</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;vii. pro "viii."<p>2.&nbsp;xviii. pro "18" </p>
