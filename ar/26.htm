<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第26节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>26.“连刺祂的人也要看见祂”表在教会中那些处于虚假的人也将看见。“刺”耶稣基督无非是指摧毁祂圣言中的神性真理。这一点也由以下经文来表示：</p><p>惟有一个兵扎祂的肋旁、随即有血和水流出来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.34.htm">19:34</a>）</p><p>“血和水”是指属灵和属世的神性真理，因而是指圣言的属灵之义和属世之义。“扎主的肋旁”指以虚假来摧毁圣言的属灵之义和属世之义，正如犹太人所行的。因为主受难的一切事都代表犹太教会在圣言方面的状态。关于这个主题，可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》（<a href="../lord/15.htm">15</a>-17节）一书。“扎”祂之所以表示以虚假摧毁圣言，是因为这论及耶稣基督，经上随后称其为“人子”，“人子”表示主的圣言，故“刺人子”就是刺圣言。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 26</h4><p>26. Even they who pierced Him. This symbolically means that even those will see Him who are caught up in falsities in the church.<p>To "pierce Jesus Christ" means nothing else than to destroy His Divine truth in the Word. This also is meant by the report that one of the soldiers pierced His side, and blood and water came out (<a href="3927/john_19_34.htm">John 19:34</a>). Blood and water are spiritual and natural Divine truth, thus the Word in its spiritual and natural senses; and to pierce the Lord's side is to destroy both by falsities, as the Jews did also. For everything connected with the Lord's suffering represented the state of the Jewish Church in relation to the Word - on which subject, see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord, nos. <a href="../lord/15.htm">15-17</a>.<p>To pierce Him means, symbolically, to destroy the Word by falsities because it is said of Jesus Christ, who is shortly called the Son of Man, and "the Son of Man" means the Lord in relation to the Word. Therefore to pierce the Son of Man is to do it to the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 26</h4><p>26. 'And they who pierced Him' signifies that those who in the Church are in untruths are also going to see. By 'to pierce' Jesus Christ is understood nothing else than to destroy His Divine Truth in the Word. This is also understood by [the statement] that:<p>One of the soldiers pierced His side, and there came out blood and water. <a href="3927/john_19_34.htm">John 19:34</a>.<p>'Blood and water' are spiritual and natural Divine Truth, thus the Word in its spiritual and in its natural sense, and 'to pierce the Lord's side' is to destroy both senses by means of untruths, as indeed was done by the Jews. For all things of the Lord's passion were representing the state of the Jewish Church as to the Word, on which subject [something] may be seen in <a href="../lord/15.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord 15-17</a>. The reason why by 'to pierce Him' is signified to destroy the Word by means of untruths is because this is said of Jesus Christ, Who is presently called the Son of Man, and by 'the Son of Man' is understood the Lord as to the Word. 'To pierce the Son of Man,' therefore, is [to do the same to] the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 26</h4><p>26. And they also who pierced Him, signifies that they also will see who are in falsities in the church. By "piercing" Jesus Christ nothing else is meant than to destroy His Divine truth in the Word. This, also, is meant by:<p>One of the soldiers pierced His side, and there went forth blood and water, (<a href="3927/john_19_34.htm">John 19:34</a>)<p>"Blood and water" are the Divine truth, spiritual and natural, thus the Word in its spiritual and in its natural sense; and "to pierce the Lord's side" is to destroy both by falsities, as was also done by the Jews; for all things of the Lord's passion represented the state of the Jewish church as to the Word, on which subject, see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord, (<a href="15.htm">15-17</a>). The reason why "piercing" Him, signifies to destroy the Word by falsities, is, because this is said of Jesus Christ, who presently is called the Son of man, and by the Son of man is meant the Lord as to the Word, therefore "to pierce the Son of man," is to do the same to the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 26 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>26. "Et qui Ipsum transfixerunt," significat quod etiam visuri qui in Ecclesia in falsis sunt. -Per "transfigere" Jesum Christum, non aliud intelligitur, quam Divinum Ipsius Verum in Verbo destruere; hoc quoque intelligitur per quod Unus militum latus Ipsius transfixerit, et quod exiverit sanguis et aqua, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_26/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_19_34" target=_top>Johannes 19:34</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>"sanguis et aqua" sunt Divinum Verum Spirituale et Naturale, ita Verbum in Sensu spirituali et naturali, et "transfigere latus" Domini est utrumque per falsa destruere, ut etiam factum est a Judaeis; omnia enim Passionis Domini repraesentabant statum Ecclesiae Judaicae quoad Verbum, de qua re videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_26/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_15" target=_top>Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 15-17</a>. Quod per "transfigere" Ipsum, significetur destruere, Verbum per falsa, est quia hoc dicitur de Jesu Christo, qui mox vocatur Filius Hominis, et per Filium Hominis intelligitur Dominus quoad Verbum, quare "Filium Hominis transfigere" est Verbum.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;34 pro "14" </p>
