<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第665节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>665.启15:4.“主阿，谁敢不敬畏你，不荣耀你的名呢”表唯独祂要被爱和敬拜。“敬畏神”表示爱祂；“荣耀祂的名”表示敬拜祂。“谁敢不”和“因为独有你是圣的”表示唯独祂被爱和敬拜。“敬畏神”就是爱祂，因为害怕做违背祂的事，这种怕或敬畏就在一切爱里面（参看<a href="527.htm">527</a>，<a href="628.htm">628</a>节）。“荣耀祂的名”是指敬拜祂，因为“耶和华的名”表示藉以敬拜祂的一切事物（<a href="81.htm">81</a>节），“荣耀”表示承认并称谢。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 665</h4><p>665. <a href="3927/revelation_15_4.htm">15:4</a> "Who does not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name?" This symbolically means that the Lord alone is to be loved and worshiped.<p>To fear God means, symbolically, to love Him, and to glorify His name means, symbolically, to worship Him. That He alone is to be loved and worshiped is meant by the phrase, "Who does not?" and by the statement, "For You alone are holy."<p>To be shown that to fear God is to love Him, fearing to act against Him, and that this fear is present in every love, see nos. <a href="527.htm">527</a>, <a href="628.htm">628</a> above.<p>To glorify His name is to worship Him because the name of Jehovah symbolizes everything by which He is worshiped (no. <a href="81.htm">81</a>), and to glorify means, symbolically, to acknowledge and confess. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 665</h4><p>665. [verse 4] 'Who shall not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify Thy Name?' signifies that He Only is to be loved and worshipped. By 'to fear God' is signified to love Him, and by 'to glorify His Name' is signified to worship Him. That He Only is to be loved and worshipped is understood by Who shall not' and by 'for Thou Only art Holy.' That 'to fear God' is to love Him by fearing to do what is against Him, and that this fear is in all love, may be seen above (<a href="527.htm">527</a>, <a href="628.htm">628</a>). 'To glorify His Name' is to worship Him, because by Jehovah's 'Name' is signified everything by means of which He is worshipped (<a href="81.htm">81</a>), and by 'to glorify' is signified to acknowledge and confess. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 665</h4><p>665. Verse 4. (<a href="3927/revelation_15_4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>) Who shall not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? signifies that He alone is to be loved and worshiped. "To fear God" signifies to love Him; and "to glorify His name" signifies to worship Him. That He alone is to be loved and worshiped is meant by "who shall not," and by "because Thou alone art holy." That to fear God is to love Him, by fearing to do what is contrary to Him, and that such fear is in all love, see above, (<a href="527.htm">527</a>, <a href="628.htm">628</a>). That "to glorify His name" is to worship Him is because by "the name" of Jehovah is signified everything by which He is worshiped, (<a href="81.htm">81</a>[1-4]); and "to glorify" signifies to acknowledge and confess. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 665 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>665. (Vers. 4.) "Quis non timeat Te, Domine, et glorificet Nomen Tuum," significat quod Solus amandus et colendus sit. -Per "timere Deum" significatur amare Ipsum; et per "glorificare Nomen Ipsius significatur colere Ipsum; quod Solus amandus et colendus sit, intelligitur per "quis non," et per "quia Solus Sanctus es:" quod timere Deum sit amare Ipsum timendo facere contra Ipsum, et quod hic timor sit in omni amore, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_665/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_527" target=_top>527</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_665/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_628" target=_top>628</a>). Quod "glorificare Nomen Ipsius" sit colere Ipsum, est quia per "Nomen" Jehovae significatur omne per quod colitur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_665/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_81" target=_top>81</a>), et per "glorificare" significatur agnoscere et confiteri. </p>
