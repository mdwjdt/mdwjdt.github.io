<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 840</h4><p>840. REVELATION: CHAPTER 20<p>1. Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. <p>2. He laid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound it for a thousand years; <p>3. and he cast it into the bottomless pit, and shut it up, and set a seal on it, so that it should not lead the nations astray any more till the thousand years were completed. But after that it must be released for a little while.<p>4. And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was entrusted to them. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the Word of God, who had not worshiped the beast or its image, and had not received its mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. <p>5. But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection. <p>6. Blessed and holy is he who shares in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.<p>7. Then, when the thousand years have been completed, Satan will be released from his prison, <p>8. and he will go out to lead astray the nations which are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea. <p>9. And they went up over the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them. <p>10. Then the devil who led them astray was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.<p>11. Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and heaven fled away. And there was not found any place for them. <p>12. And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and their books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, in accordance with the things which were written in their books. <p>13. Then the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hell delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. <p>14. Then Death and Hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. <p>15. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.<p>THE SPIRITUAL MEANING<p>The Contents of the Whole Chapter<p>The removal of those people meant by the dragon (verses 1-3), and the ascent then of those in the lower earth, <sup>1</sup>who worshiped the Lord and refrained from evils as being sins (verses 4-6). The judgment on those having no religion in their worship (verses 7-9). The damnation of the dragon (verse 10). The universal judgment on all the rest (verses 11-15).<p>The Contents of the Individual Verses:<p></p><table><thead><tr><th>Verse Contents</th><th>Spiritual Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.</td><td>The Lord's Divine operation into the lower regions by virtue of His Divine power to close and open and to bind and loose.</td></tr><tr><td>2. He laid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, which is the Devil and Satan,</td><td>Those meant by the dragon were detained, who because they think about matters of faith sensually and not spiritually, are called that serpent of old, who because they are caught up in evils in the way they live, are called the Devil, and who because they are caught up in falsities as regards their doctrine, are called Satan.</td></tr><tr><td>and bound it for a thousand years;</td><td>Those meant by the dragon here were forcibly drawn away and separated from the rest of the people in the world of spirits to keep them from having any communication with the rest for a while or a period of time.</td></tr><tr><td>3. and he cast it into the bottomless pit, and shut it up, and set a seal on it, so that it should not lead the nations astray any more</td><td>The Lord removed entirely those who were caught up in faith alone and took away all their communication with the rest, to keep them from inspiring any of their heresy in people who were being raised into heaven.</td></tr><tr><td>till the thousand years were completed. But after that it must be released for a little while.</td><td>This was the case for a while or for a period of time until people with truths springing from goodness were raised by the Lord into heaven, after which those meant by the dragon would for a short time be set loose and have a communication opened with those who were left.</td></tr><tr><td>4. And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was entrusted to them.</td><td>The Word's truths were laid open, in accordance with which all people are judged, and those in the lower earth were then raised up, who had been hidden away by the Lord to keep the dragon and its beasts from leading them astray;</td></tr><tr><td>I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the Word of God,</td><td>who had been rejected by those caught up in falsities hatched out of their own intelligence, because they worshiped the Lord and lived in accordance with the truths in His Word,</td></tr><tr><td>who had not worshiped the beast or its image, and had not received its mark on their foreheads or on their hands.</td><td>and did not acknowledge or accept the doctrine of faith alone;</td></tr><tr><td>And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.</td><td>who possessed a conjunction with the Lord already and had been in His kingdom for some time.</td></tr><tr><td>5. But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were completed.</td><td>Besides these just described, no others were raised into heaven until after the dragon was set loose and they were then tried and examined to discover their character.</td></tr><tr><td>This is the first resurrection.</td><td>Salvation and eternal life consist primarily in worshiping the Lord and living according to His commandments in the Word, because these are the means to conjunction with the Lord and affiliation with angels in heaven.</td></tr><tr><td>6. Blessed and holy is he who shares in the first resurrection.</td><td>Through conjunction with the Lord those who enter heaven enjoy the felicity of eternal life and enlightenment.</td></tr><tr><td>Over such the second death has no power,</td><td>They do not suffer damnation,</td></tr><tr><td>but they shall be priests of God and of Christ,</td><td>because they are kept by the Lord in the goodness of love and so in truths of wisdom.</td></tr><tr><td>and shall reign with Him a thousand years.</td><td>They were already in heaven when the rest who did not live again, that is, who did not accept the life of heaven, were still in the world of spirits.</td></tr><tr><td>7. Then, when the thousand years have been completed, Satan will be released from his prison,</td><td>After the Lord raised into heaven those who previously had been hidden away and protected in the lower earth, and the New Christian Heaven was increased by their number, all those who had confirmed themselves in falsities of faith were let loose.</td></tr><tr><td>8. and he will go out to lead astray the nations which are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for battle,</td><td>Those meant by the dragon here drew to their side from any land throughout the world of spirits all who lived the life of an external, natural worship only and no internal, spiritual worship, and roused them up against those who worshiped the Lord and lived according to His commandments in the Word.</td></tr><tr><td>whose number is as the sand of the sea.</td><td>The multitude of such people.</td></tr><tr><td>9. And they went up over the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city.</td><td>Being roused up by followers of the dragon, they scorned every truth in the church and attempted to destroy everything connected with the New Church and its fundamental doctrine regarding the Lord and life.</td></tr><tr><td>And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.</td><td>They were destroyed by the lusts of their hellish love.</td></tr><tr><td>10. Then the devil who led them astray was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</td><td>People who were caught up in evils in the way they lived and in falsities as regards their doctrine were cast into hell.</td></tr><tr><td>11. Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and heaven fled away. And there was not found any place for them.</td><td>A universal judgment executed by the Lord on all the former heavens that were occupied by people possessing a civil and moral goodness, but no spiritual goodness, thus who gave the appearance of being Christians outwardly, but who inwardly were devils. These heavens with their lands were totally dispersed so that no part of them was seen anymore.</td></tr><tr><td>12. And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God,</td><td>All people of every condition and character, who had died from earthly lands and were now among those in the world of spirits, gathered by the Lord for judgment.</td></tr><tr><td>and their books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life.</td><td>The interiors of their minds were opened, of both the good and the evil, and by an influx of light and warmth from heaven their characters were seen and perceived in respect to the affections of their love or will, and so in respect to the thoughts of their faith or intellect.</td></tr><tr><td>And the dead were judged according to their works, in accordance with the things which were written in their books.</td><td>All were judged in accordance with the inner life within their outward appearances.</td></tr><tr><td>13. Then the sea gave up the dead who were in it,</td><td>External and natural people in the church called together for judgment.</td></tr><tr><td>and Death and Hell delivered up the dead who were in them.</td><td>The impious at heart in the church, who in themselves were devils and satanic spirits, called together for judgment.</td></tr><tr><td>And they were judged, each one according to his works.</td><td>The same as before.</td></tr><tr><td>14. Then Death and Hell were cast into the lake of fire.</td><td>The impious at heart, who in themselves were devils and satanic spirits, and yet in outward appearances seemed to be people of the church, were cast down into hell among spirits who were caught up in a love of evil and so in a love of falsity according with evil.</td></tr><tr><td>This is the second death.</td><td>This is their final damnation.</td></tr><tr><td>15. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.</td><td>Those who had not lived in accordance with the Lord's commandments in the Word and did not believe in the Lord were condemned.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>THE EXPOSITION<p><a href="3927/revelation_20_1.htm">20:1</a> Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. This symbolizes the Lord's operation into the lower regions by virtue of His Divine power to close and open and to bind and loose.<p>An angel coming down from heaven means the Lord, as may be seen in nos. <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="258.htm">258</a>, <a href="344.htm">344</a>, <a href="465.htm">465</a>, <a href="657.htm">657</a>, <a href="718.htm">718</a>, and also the Lord's operation, nos. <a href="415.htm">415</a>, <a href="631.htm">631</a>, <a href="633.htm">633</a>, <a href="649.htm">649</a>, here His operation into the lower regions, because the angel is described as coming down. Having the key to the bottomless pit symbolizes the Divine power to open and close hell, as may be seen in nos. <a href="62.htm">62</a>, <a href="174.htm">174</a>. And having a great chain in his hand symbolizes the endeavor and so the action of binding and loosing.<p>It follows, therefore, that there was no key or chain in the Lord's hand, but that its appearing so to John was representative of the Lord's Divine power. This chapter also refers two or three times to the opening and closing of hell. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Cf. references to the lower parts of the earth in <a href="3927/psalms_63_9.htm">Psalms 63:9</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_44_23.htm">Isaiah 44:23</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_32_24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>, and also <a href="3927/ephesians_4_9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 840</h4><p>840. THE TWENTIETH CHAPTER<p>1. And I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the deep, and a great chain in (super) his hand.<p>2. And he arrested the dragon, the serpent of old who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.<p>3. And he cast him into the deep, and shut him up and set a seal upon him, lest he should lead the nations astray any more until the thousand years were finished, and after that he must be let loose for a short time.<p>4. And I saw thrones and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them; and the souls of those beheaded with the axe for the testimony of Jesus and for the Word of God, and who did not adore the beast or his image, and did not accept the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ for the thousand years.<p>5. And the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.<p>6. Blessed and holy is he having part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they shall be priests of God and Christ, and shall reign with Him for the thousand years.<p>7. And when the thousand years are finished Satan shall be let loose out of his prison.<p>8. And he shall go forth to lead astray the nations that are at the four corners of the land, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for war, the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.<p>9. And they went up upon the breadth of the land and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire from God came down from heaven and consumed them.<p>10. And the devil leading them astray was cast into the lake of fire and sulphur, where the beast and the false prophet are, and they shall be tormented days and nights for ages of ages.<p>11. And I saw a great white throne, and One sitting upon it, from Whose face the land and the heaven fled away; and no place was found for them.<p>12. And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is of life; and the dead were judged out of the things written in the books according to their works.<p>13. And the sea gave up those who were dead in it, and death and hell gave up those dead in them, and they were judged, each one, according to their works.<p>14. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire: this is the second death.<p>15. And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.<p>THE SPIRITUAL SENSE<p>THE CONTENTS OF THE WHOLE CHAPTER<p>Concerning the removal of those who are understood by the dragon' (verses 1-3), and then concerning the ascent out of the lower land of those who have worshipped the Lord and fled from evils as sins (verses 4-6).<p>The judgment upon those who had nothing of religion in worship (verses 7-9).<p>The damnation of 'the dragon' (verse 10).<p>The general judgment upon the rest (verses 11-15).<p>THE CONTENTS OF EACH OF THE VERSES<p>1. And I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the deep, and a great chain in (super) his hand, signifies the Lord's Divine operation into lower things by virtue of the Divine authority of shutting and opening, also of binding and letting loose.<p>2. And he arrested the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the Devil and Satan, signifies that those were held back who are understood by 'the dragon,' who, because they think sensually and not spiritually about matters of faith are termed 'the serpent of old,' and because they are in evils as to life are termed 'the Devil,' and because they are in untruths as to doctrine are termed 'Satan.'<p>And bound him for a thousand years, signifies that those who are here understood by 'the dragon' were withdrawn and torn away from the rest in the world of spirits, so that for a while or for a considerable time there should not be communication with them.<p>3. And cast him into the deep, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him lest he should lead the nations astray any more, signifies that the Lord entirely removed those who were in faith alone and took away all communication between them and the rest, lest they should inspire anything of their heresy into those who were being taken up into heaven.<p>Until the thousand years were finished, and after that he must be let loose for a short time, signifies these things for a while or for a considerable time, until those who were in truths derived from good were taken up by the Lord into heaven; after which those who are understood by 'the dragon' are to be let loose for a short time and communication between them and the rest opened.<p>4. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgement was given unto them, signifies that the truths of the Word in accordance with which all are judged were opened, and that then those who had been hidden by the Lord were taken up out of the lower land lest they should be led astray by 'the dragon' and his 'beasts.'<p>And the souls of those beheaded with the axe for the testimony of Jesus and for the Word of God, signifies [that they were] rejected by those who are in untruths derived from self-intelligence, because they worshipped the Lord and lived in accordance with the truths of His Word.<p>And who did not adore the beast or his image, and did not accept the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand, signifies who did not acknowledge and receive the doctrine concerning faith alone.<p>And they lived and reigned with Christ for the thousand years, signifies who had already been in conjunction with the Lord and in His kingdom for some time.<p>5.

Blessed and holy is he having part in the first resurrection, signifies that those who come into heaven have the happiness of eternal life and enlightenment through conjunction with the Lord.<p>Over these the second death has no authority, signifies that they do not suffer damnation.<p>But they shall be priests of God and Christ, signifies because they are kept by the Lord in the good of love and consequently in the truths of wisdom.<p>And they shall reign with Him for the thousand years, signifies that they were already in heaven when the rest who did not live again, that is, accept heavenly life, were in the world of spirits.<p>7. And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be let loose out of his prison, signifies that, after those who had till then been hidden and guarded in the lower land were taken up by the Lord into heaven and by means of them the Christian New Heaven was increased, all those who confirmed untruths of faith with themselves should be let out.<p>8. And shall go forth to lead astray the nations that are at the four corners of the land, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for war, signifies that those who are here understood by 'the dragon' would draw to their side all who were of the territories in the entire world of spirits and lived there in a worship only external natural and in no internal spiritual worship, and would rouse them up against those who worshipped the Lord and lived in accordance with His precepts in the Word.<p>The number of whom is as the sand of the sea, signifies the multitude of such.<p>9. And they went up upon the breadth of the land and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, signifies that being roused up by the dragonists they would despise every truth of the Church and endeavour to destroy all the things of the New Church, and the doctrine itself concerning the Lord and concerning Life.<p>And fire from God came down out of heaven and consumed them, signifies that they perished from the lusts of infernal love.<p>10. And the devil leading them astray was cast into the lake of fire and sulphur, where the beast and the false prophet are, and they shall be tormented days and nights for ages of ages, signifies those cast into hell, who were in evils as to life and in untruths as to doctrine.<p>11. And I saw a great white throne, and One sitting upon it, from Whose face the heaven and the land <sup>1</sup>fled away [, and no place was found for them], signifies the universal judgment executed by the Lord upon all the former heavens that were occupied by (super quibus fuerunt) those who were in civil and moral good but in no spiritual good, thus who in external things were pretending to be Christians but in internal things were devils; which heavens with their territory were entirely done away with so that nothing of them would appear any more.<p>12. And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, signifies all those of whatever condition and quality from on earth who, having died, were now among those who were in the world of spirits, gathered together by the Lord for judgment.<p>And the books were opened, and another book was opened which is of life, signifies that the interior things of the mind of all of them were laid open, and by means of the influx of light and heat out of heaven it was seen and perceived what they were like as to the affections that are of love or of the will, and consequently as to the thoughts that are of faith or of the understanding, the evil as well as the good.<p>And the dead were judged out of the things written in the books according to their works, signifies that they were all judged in accordance with their internal life in external things.<p>13. And the sea gave up those who were dead in it, signifies the external and natural men of the Church called to judgment.<p>And death and hell gave up those who were dead in them, signifies the wicked-hearted men of the Church, who in themselves were devils and satans, called together to judgment.<p>And they were judged, each one, according to their works signifies here as before.<p>14. And deaths and hell were cast into the lake of fire, signifies that the wicked-hearted who in themselves were devils and satans, and yet in external things like men of the Church, were cast down into hell among those who were in the love of evil and consequently in the love of untruths agreeing with evil.<p>This is the second death, signifies that these suffer damnation itself<p>15. And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire, signifies that those who did not live in accordance with the Lord's precepts in His Word, and did not believe us the Lord, were condemned.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Here and in the 'Contents of each of the Verses' the words 'land' and heaven' are transposed. Cf. the text of the chapter and the exposition in subsection 2 of this paragraph.<br><br>THE EXPOSITION<br><br>[verse 1] 'And I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the deep, and a great chain in (super) his hand' signifies the Lord's operation into lower things by virtue of the Divine authority of shutting and opening, also of binding and letting loose.

It follows from this that there was not any key or chain in the Lord's hand, but that its having been so seen by John was a representative of the Lord's Divine Authority. In this chapter it treats a second and a third time of the opening of hell and the closing thereof. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 840</h4><p>840. Revelation 20<p>1. And I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand.<p>2. And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years;<p>3. And cast him into the abyss, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should not seduce the nations any more, until the thousand years were finished; and after this he must be loosed a little time.<p>4. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them, and the souls of them that were beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the Word of God, and who had not adored the beast, nor his image, nor had received his mark upon their forehead, and upon their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.<p>5. And the rest of the dead lived not again, until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.<p>6. Happy and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection; upon these the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.<p>7. And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,<p>8. And shall go forth to seduce the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to war; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.<p>9. And they went up upon the breadth of the earth, and encompassed the camp of the saints and the beloved city; and fire came down from God out of heaven and consumed them.<p>10. And the Devil that seduced them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are; and shall be tormented day and night for ages of ages.<p>11. And I saw a great white throne, and Him that sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and no place was found for them.<p>12. And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God; and the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.<p>13. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and hell gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged everyone according to their works.<p>14. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.<p>15. And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.<p>The Spiritual Sense<p>The Contents of the Whole Chapter<p>Concerning the removal of those who are meant by "the dragon,"' (verses <a href="3927/revelation_18_1.htm">1-3</a>), and then concerning the ascent of those from the lower earth, who worshiped the Lord and shunned evils as sins (verses <a href="3927/revelation_18_4.htm">4-6</a>).

(<a href="3927/revelation_20_2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>) "And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan," signifies that they were withheld who are meant by the dragon, who, because they think sensually and not spiritually of matters of faith, are called "the old serpent," and because they are in evils as to life, are called the Devil, and because they are in falsities as to doctrine, are called Satan, (<a href="841.htm">841</a>). "And bound him a thousand years," signifies that they who are here meant by the dragon, were withdrawn and torn away from the rest in the world of spirits, that for a short time there might be no communication with them, (<a href="842.htm">842</a>).<p>Verse 3.

"And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them," signifies that the truths of the Word, according to which all are judged, were opened, and that then they were taken up from the lower earth, who had been concealed by the Lord, that they might not be seduced by the dragon and his beasts, (<a href="845.htm">845</a>). "And the souls of them that were beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the Word of God," signifies that they were rejected by those who were in falsities from their own intelligence, because they worshiped the Lord, and lived according to the truths of His Word, (<a href="846.htm">846</a>, <a href="847.htm">847</a>). "And who had not adored the beast, nor his image, nor had received his mark upon their forehead, and upon their hand," signifies who did not acknowledge and receive the doctrine of faith alone, (<a href="848.htm">848</a>). "And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years," signifies who have been already for some time in conjunction with the Lord and in His kingdom, (<a href="849.htm">849</a>).<p>Verse 5. "And the rest of the dead lived not again, until the thousand years were finished," signifies that besides these, now spoken of, none were taken up into heaven, till after the dragon was loosed, and that they were then proved and explored as to their quality, (<a href="850.htm">850</a>). "This is the first resurrection," signifies that salvation and life eternal primarily consist in worshiping the Lord and living according to His commandments in the Word, because by them conjunction is effected with the Lord and consociation with the angels of heaven, (<a href="851.htm">851</a>).<p>Verse 6.

"Upon these the second death hath no power," signifies that they have not damnation, (<a href="853.htm">853</a>): "But they shall be priests of God and of Christ," signifies, because they are kept by the Lord in the good of love and thence in the truths of wisdom, (<a href="854.htm">854</a>). "And shall reign with Him a thousand years," signifies that they were already in heaven, when the rest who had not revived, that is, as yet received heavenly life, were in the world of spirits, (<a href="855.htm">855</a>).<p>Verse 7.

Ver. 8. "And shall go forth to seduce the nations, which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to war," signifies that they who are here meant by the dragon, would draw to their party all those who were from the earths in the whole world of spirits, and lived there only in external natural worship and in no internal spiritual worship, and would stir them up against those who worshiped the Lord, and lived according to His commandments in the Word, (<a href="858.htm">858</a>, <a href="859.htm">859</a>). "The number of whom is as the sand of the sea," signifies the multitude of such, (<a href="860.htm">860</a>).<p>Verse 9. "And they went up upon the breadth of the earth, and encompassed the camp of the saints, and the beloved city," signifies that being stirred up by the dragonists, they spurned every truth of the church, and endeavored to destroy all things of the New Church, and even its doctrine concerning the Lord and concerning life, (<a href="861.htm">861</a>, <a href="862.htm">862</a>). "And fire came down from God out of heaven and consumed them," signifies that they were destroyed by the lusts of infernal love, (<a href="863.htm">863</a>).<p>Verse 10. "And the Devil that seduced them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ages of ages," signifies that they who were in evils as to life, and in falsities as to doctrine, were cast into hell, (<a href="864.htm">864</a>).<p>Verse 11.

"And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, signifies all who had died from the earth, and were now among those who were in the world of spirits, of whatever condition and quality, gathered together by the Lord for judgment, (<a href="866.htm">866</a>). "And the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life," signifies that the interiors of the minds of them all were laid open, and by the influx of light and heat from heaven, their quality was seen and perceived as to the affections which are of the love or the will, and thence as to the thoughts which are of faith or the understanding, as well the evil as the good, (<a href="867.htm">867</a>). "And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works," signifies that all were judged according to their internal life in externals, (<a href="868.htm">868</a>).<p>Verse 13. "And the sea gave up the dead which were in it," signifies the external and natural men of the church called to judgment, (<a href="869.htm">869</a>).

"This is the second death," signifies that with these there is damnation itself, (<a href="873.htm">873</a>).<p>Verse 15. "And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire," signifies that they who had not lived according to the Lord's commandments in the Word, and had not believed in the Lord, were condemned, (<a href="874.htm">874</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original Latin omits "and, (<a href="3927/revelation_20_1.htm">Revelation 20:1</a>) no place was found for them."<p>THE EXPLANATION.<p>Verse 1. And I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand, signifies the Lord's operation into lower things, from His Divine power of shutting and opening, and of binding and loosing. By "an angel coming down from heaven," is meant the Lord (see <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="170.htm">170</a>, <a href="344.htm">344</a>, <a href="465.htm">465</a>, <a href="657.htm">657</a>, <a href="718.htm">718</a>); also the Lord's operation, (<a href="415.htm">415</a>, <a href="631.htm">631</a>, <a href="633.htm">633</a>, <a href="649.htm">649</a>); here into lower things, because it is said "coming down;" by having "the key of the abyss" is signified the Divine power of opening and shutting hell (see <a href="62.htm">62</a>, <a href="174.htm">174</a>); and "by having a great chain in his hand," is signified the endeavor and thence the act of binding and loosing. Hence it follows that there was not any key nor a chain in the Lord's hand; but it was so seen by John that it might be a representative of the Lord's Divine power; the opening and shutting of hell is also treated of two or three times in this chapter. </p>
