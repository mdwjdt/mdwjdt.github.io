<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第329节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>329.“又有话对他们说，还要安息片时，等着一同作仆人的和他们的弟兄，也像他们被杀，满足了数目”表最后审判还要延迟片刻，直到那些因承认主的神性人并照其圣言的真理生活而同样被恶者恨恶、遭到侮辱和排斥之人聚集起来。所表示的是这些事，这一点从前面的话明显可知。以赛亚书中的这段经文具有同样的含义：</p><p>你的死人要活过来；住在尘埃里的，你要醒起、欢呼；我的百姓要来进入内室，关上你后面的门，隐藏片时，等到忿怒过去。因为，看哪，耶和华从祂的居所出来，要刑罚地上居民的罪孽；地也必露出她的血，不再掩盖被杀的人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛26.19.htm">26:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛26.21.htm">21</a>）</p><p>但如前所述，该主题，以及其它具有类似性质的主题在第20章及以后的解读中（<a href="840.htm">840</a>-<a href="874.htm">874</a>节）有所论述。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 329</h4><p>329. And it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until the number of both their fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they were, was complete. This symbolically means that the Last Judgment would be delayed a little while longer, until those people should be gathered together from all sides who likewise were hated by the evil, treated with scorn and expelled because of their acknowledgment of the Lord's humanity and their life in accordance with His Word's truths.<p>That this is the symbolic meaning is apparent from what we have already said.<p>A similar symbolism is found in the following passage in Isaiah:<p>Your dead shall live... Awake and rejoice, you who dwell in dust... Go, my people, enter into your chambers, and shut the door behind you; hide yourself, as it were, for a little moment, until the anger is past. For behold, Jehovah is coming from His place, to punish the inhabitant of the earth for his iniquity; then the earth will disclose her blood, and will no more conceal her slain. (<a href="3927/isaiah_26_19.htm">Isaiah 26:19-21</a>)<p>But as we said before, these people and others like them are the subject in chapter 20ff., a chapter which we have explained in nos. <a href="840.htm">840-874</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 329</h4><p>329. 'And it was said [unto them] that they should rest yet a little while, until both their fellow-servants [and their brothers], who were going to be slain as they had been, are made up to the full extent' signifies that the last judgment would be deferred a little longer, until those who in like manner are hated suffer insults, and are rejected by the evil for the acknowledgment of the Lord's Divine Human and a life in accordance with the truths of the Word, have been gathered from everywhere. That these things are signified is plain from the things said above. Similar things are signified by these in Isaiah:<p>Thy dead shall live; awake and shout, O dwellers of the dust. Depart, my people, enter into thy bedroom, and shut the door after thee, hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the anger be passed by; for behold, Jehovah going forth out of His place to visit the iniquity of the inhabitant of the land upon him; the land then shall disclose her bloods, and shall no longer hide her slain. <a href="3927/isaiah_26_19.htm">Isaiah 26:19-21</a>.<p>But, as was said above, in chapter <a href="3927/revelation_20_1.htm">20</a> and onwards it treats of these and similar things. This has been expounded from <a href="840.htm">840-874</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 329</h4><p>329. And it was said, <sup>1</sup>that they should rest yet for a little while, until their fellow-servants <sup>2</sup>that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled, signifies that the Last Judgment should yet be delayed a little, till they should be collected from all quarters, who would, in like manner, be hated, reproached, and rejected by the evil for acknowledging the Lord's Divine Human, and for living according to the truths of His Word. That this is the signification, appears from what has been said above. Similar is the signification of this passage in Isaiah:<p>Thy dead shall live; awake and shout, ye that dwell in the dust; Come, my people, enter into thy chambers, and shut the door after thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the anger be passed by. For, behold, Jehovah goeth forth out of His place, to visit the iniquity of the inhabitants of the earth upon him; the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain, (<a href="3927/isaiah_26_19.htm">26:19-21</a>).<p>But, as was said before, this subject, and others of a similar nature, are treated of in chapter 20 and following, which is explained, (<a href="840.htm">840-874</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The original Latin omits "to them."<br><br>2.&nbsp;The original Latin omits "and their brethren." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 329 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>329. "Et dictum (iis), ut adhuc requiescerent tempus parvum, usque dum complentur et conservi eorum, (et fratres eorum) qui futuri occidi sicut illi" significat quod Ultimum Judicium parum adhuc protraheretur, usque dum ab undequaque collecti fuerint, qui similiter odio habentur, contumeliis afficiuntur, et rejiciuntur a malis propter agnitionem Humani Domini, et vitam secundum vera Verbi Ipsius. -Quod haec significentur, patet a supradictis. Similia significantur per haec apud Esajam: <p>"Vivent mortui tui; evigilate et jubilate habitatores pulveris: abi popule mi, intra in cubicula tua, et claude januam post te, occulta te sicut parum momenti, usque dum transeat ira: nam ecce Jehovah exiens e loco Suo, ad visitandum iniquitatem habitatoris terrae super illum; tunc revelabit terra sanguines suos, et non celabit amplius occisos suos," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_329/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_26_19-21" target=_top>26:19-21</a>).<p>Sed, ut supra dictum est, de his et similibus agitur in capite <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_329/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_1-15" target=_top>20</a> seq., quod explicatum est a <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_329/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_840" target=_top>840-874</a>. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;840 pro "839" </p>
