<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 656</h4><p>656. REVELATION: CHAPTER 15<p>1. Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them the wrath of God is complete.<p>2. And I saw as though a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who have the victory over the beast, over its image and over its mark and over the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass, having harps of God.<p>3. They sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying:<p>"Great and marvelous are Your works,<p>Lord God Almighty!<p>Just and true are Your ways,<p>O King of the saints!<p>4. Who does not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name?<p>For You alone are holy.<p>Therefore all nations shall come and worship before You,<p>For Your judgments have been manifested."<p>5. After these things I looked, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.<p>6. And out of the temple came the seven angels having the seven plagues, clothed in clean bright linen, and having their chests girded with golden sashes.<p>7. Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever.<p>8. And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power, and no one was able to enter the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels were ended.<p>THE SPIRITUAL MEANING<p>The Contents of the Whole Chapter<p>A preparation to reveal the last state of the church and expose the evils and falsities in which those who belonged to that church were caught up (verses 1, 5-8). The separation from them of those who had confessed the Lord and lived in accordance with His commandments (verses 2-4).<p>The Contents of the Individual Verses:<p></p><table><thead><tr><th>Verse Contents</th><th>Spiritual Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous:</td><td>A revelation from the Lord regarding the state of the church on earth and its character with respect to love and faith.</td></tr><tr><td>seven angels having the seven last plagues,</td><td>The evils and falsities that exist in the church in its last state exposed in their entirety by the Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>for in them the wrath of God is complete.</td><td>The destruction of the church and its end then.</td></tr><tr><td>2.

They sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb,</td><td>A confession springing from charity, thus from a life in accordance with the precepts of the Law contained in the Ten Commandments, and from a faith in the Divinity of the Lord's humanity.</td></tr><tr><td>saying: "Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty!</td><td>Everything in the world, in heaven and in the church was created and formed by the Lord out of Divine love by means of Divine wisdom.</td></tr><tr><td>For just and true are Your ways, O King of the saints!</td><td>Everything that emanates from the Lord is just and true, because He is Divine goodness itself and Divine truth itself in heaven and in the church.</td></tr><tr><td>4.

This symbolizes a revelation from the Lord regarding the state of the church on earth and its character with respect to love and faith.<p>This is the subject of the present chapter and the next, and it is symbolically meant, therefore, by a sign in heaven, great and marvelous. That a sign in heaven symbolizes a revelation from the Lord regarding heaven and the church and their state, may be seen in nos. <a href="532.htm">532</a>, <a href="536.htm">536</a> above. That it has to do with love and faith is because it is called great and marvelous, and greatness in the Word is predicated of things having to do with affection and love, while marvelousness is predicated of things having to do with thought and faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 656</h4><p>656. THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER<p>1. And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous; seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them the wrath of God has been consummated.<p>2. And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those having victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, standing beside the sea of glass, having harps of God.<p>3. And they were singing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are Thy works, O Lord God Almighty, just and true are Thy ways, O King of saints.<p>4. Who shall not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify Thy Name? for Thou Only art Holy; therefore all the nations shall come and adore before Thee, for Thy judgments have been made manifest.<p>5. And after these things I saw, and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.<p>6. And the seven angels having the seven plagues went out of the temple, clothed with clean and shining linen, and girded about the breasts with golden girdles.<p>7. And one of the four animals gave unto the seven angels seven golden phials fill of the wrath of the God living for ages of ages.<p>8. And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His vigour (virlus), and no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were consummated.<p>THE SPIRITUAL SENSE<p>THE CONTENTS OF THE WHOLE CHAPTER<p>The preparation for discovering the last state of the Church, and for laying bare the evils and untruths in which they are (verse 1, 5-8); from which have been separated those who have confessed the Lord and lived in accordance with His precepts (verses 2-4).<p>THE CONTENTS OF EACH OF THE VERSES<p>1. And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, signifies a revelation by the Lord concerning the state of the Church on earth, what it is like as to love and faith.<p>Seven angels having the seven last plagues, signifies the evils and untruths in the Church, such as they are in its last state, completely (universaliter) disclosed by the Lord.<p>For in them the wrath of God has been consummated, signifies the devastation of the Church and its end then.<p>2. And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire, signifies the ultimate boundary of the spiritual world, where those had been gathered together who had religion and worship therefrom, and no good of life.<p>And those having victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, signifies those who have rejected faith alone and its doctrine, and thus have neither acknowledged and absorbed its untruths, nor falsified the Word.<p>Standing beside the sea of glass having harps of God, signifies the Christian heaven at its boundaries, and the faith of charity with those who are there.<p>3. And they were singing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, signifies a confession out of charity, thus out of a life in accordance with the precepts of the Law which is the Decalogue, and out of faith concerning the Divinity of the Lord's Human.<p>Saying, Great and marvellous are Thy works, O Lord God Almighty, signifies that all the things of the world, of heaven, and of the Church have been created and done by the Lord out of Divine Love by means of Divine Wisdom.<p>For just and true are Thy ways, O King of saints, signifies that all the things that proceed from Him are just and true, because He is Divine Good Itself and Divine Truth in heaven and in the Church.<p>4. Who shall not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify Thy Name?, signifies that He Only is to be loved and worshipped.<p>For Thou Only art Holy, signifies that He is the Word, the Truth (veritas), and Enlightenment.<p>Therefore all the nations shall come and adore before Thee, signifies that all who are in the good of love and charity will acknowledge the Lord to be the Only God.<p>For Thy judgments have been made manifest, signifies that the truths of the Word openly testify this.<p>5. After these things I saw, and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened, signifies that the inmost of heaven was seen, where the Lord is in His holiness in the Word, and in the Law which is the Decalogue.<p>6. And the seven angels having the seven plagues went out of the temple, signifies preparation by the Lord for an influx out of the inmost of heaven into the Church, so that its evils and untruths might be disclosed, and thus the evil be separated from the good.<p>Clothed with clean and shining linen, and girded about the breasts with golden girdles, signifies this out of the pure and genuine truths and goods of the Word.<p>7. And one of the four animals gave unto the seven angels seven golden phials, signifies those truths and goods by means of which the evils and untruths of the Church are disclosed taken from the sense of the letter of the Word.<p>Full of the wrath of the God living for ages of ages, signifies the evils and untruths about to appear and be disclosed by means of the pure and genuine truths and goods of the Word.<p>8. And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His vigour (virtus), signifies the inmost of heaven full of the Lord's spiritual and celestial Divine Truth.<p>And no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were consummated, signifies to this degree there that more could not be endured and this until after the devastation the end of that Church was seen.<p>THE EXPOSITION<p>[verse 1] 'And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous' signifies a revelation by the Lord concerning the state of the Church on earth, what it is like as to love and faith. These are the things of which it treats in this and the following chapter. Therefore these are signified by the 'sign in heaven, great and marvellous.' That by 'a sign in heaven' is signified a revelation by the Lord concerning heaven and the Church, and their state, may be seen above (<a href="532.htm">532</a>, <a href="536.htm">536</a>). It is [a revelation] concerning love and faith, because it is termed 'great and marvellous,' and 'great' in the Word is said of such things as are of affection and love, and 'marvellous' of such as are of thought and faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 656</h4><p>656. Revelation 15<p>1. And I saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is consummated the anger of God.<p>2. And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire, and them that had the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, standing by the sea of glass, having the harps of God.<p>3.

Who shall not fear Thee, O Lord; and glorify Thy name, for Thou alone art Holy: therefore all the nations shall come, and shall adore before Thee; because Thy judgments are made manifest.<p>5. And after these things I saw, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.<p>6. And the seven angels that had the seven plagues went out of the temple, clothed in linen clean and bright, and girded about the breasts with golden girdles.<p>7. And one of the four animals gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials, full of the anger of God who liveth for ages of ages.<p>8. And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from His power: and no one could enter into the temple, until the seven plagues of the seven angels were consummated.<p>THE SPIRITUAL SENSE<p>The contents of the whole chapter<p>The preparation for disclosing the last state of the church, and for laying open the evils and falsities in which they are (verses <a href="3927/revelation_15_1.htm">1</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_15_5.htm">5-8</a>); from whom those are separated who have confessed the Lord, and have lived according to His precepts (verses <a href="3927/revelation_15_2.htm">2-4</a>).<p>The contents of each verse<p>Verse 1. "And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous," signifies revelation by the Lord concerning the state of the church on earth, what it is as to love and faith, (<a href="656.htm">656</a>). "Seven angels having the seven last plagues," signifies the evils and falsities in the church, such as they are in its last state, disclosed universally by the Lord, (<a href="657.htm">657</a>). "For in them is consummated the anger of God," signifies the devastation of the church, and then its end, (<a href="658.htm">658</a>).<p>Verse 2. "And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire," signifies the farthest boundary of the spiritual world, where those were gathered together who had religion, and worship from it, but not the good of life, (<a href="659.htm">659</a>). "And them that had the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name," signifies those who have rejected faith alone and the doctrine of it, and so have not acknowledged and imbued its falsities, nor falsified the Word, (<a href="660.htm">660</a>). "Standing by the sea of glass, having the harps of God," signifies the Christian heaven in the boundaries, and the faith of charity with those who were there, (<a href="661.htm">661</a>).<p>Verse 3. "And they were singing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb," signifies confession from charity, and thus from a life according to the precepts of the law, which is the Decalogue, and from faith in the Divinity of the Lord's Human, (<a href="662.htm">662</a>[1-3]); "saying, Great and marvelous are Thy works, O Lord God Almighty," signifies that all things of the world, of heaven, and of the church were created and made by the Lord from Divine love by Divine wisdom, (<a href="663.htm">663</a>). "For just and true are Thy ways, O King of saints," signifies that all things which proceed from Him are just and true, because He is Divine good itself and Divine truth itself in heaven and in the church, (<a href="664.htm">664</a>).<p>Verse 4. "Who shall not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify Thy name," signifies that He alone is to be loved and worshiped, (<a href="665.htm">665</a>). "For Thou alone art Holy," signifies that He is the Word, the Truth, and Enlightenment, (<a href="666.htm">666</a>)." Wherefore all nations shall come and adore before Thee," signifies that all who are in the good of love and charity acknowledge the Lord alone as God, (<a href="667.htm">667</a>). "Because Thy judgments are made manifest," signifies that the truths of the Word openly testify this, (<a href="668.htm">668</a>).<p>Verse 5. "After these things, I saw, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened," signifies that the inmost of heaven was seen, where the Lord is in His holiness in the Word, and in the Law, which is the Decalogue, (<a href="669.htm">669</a>).<p>Verse 6. "And the seven angels that had the seven plagues went out of the temple," signifies preparation by the Lord for influx from the inmost of heaven into the church, that its evils and falsities might be disclosed, and thus the evil be separated from the good, (<a href="670.htm">670</a>). "Clothed in linen clean and bright, and girded about the breasts with golden girdles," signifies that this was from the pure and genuine truths and goods of the Word, (<a href="671.htm">671</a>).<p>Verse 7. "And one of the four animals gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials," signifies those truths and goods, by which the evils and falsities of the church are disclosed, taken from the sense of the letter of the Word, (<a href="672.htm">672</a>). "Full of the anger of God that liveth for ages of ages," signifies the evils and falsities that would appear and would be exposed by the pure and genuine truths and goods of the Word, (<a href="673.htm">673</a>).<p>Verse 8. "And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power," signifies the inmost of heaven full of the Lord's spiritual and celestial Divine Truth, (<a href="674.htm">674</a>a). "And no one could enter into the temple, until the seven plagues of the seven angels were consummated," signifies to such a degree there, that more could not be endured, and this until after devastation the end of that church was seen, (<a href="674.htm">674</a>b).<p>THE EXPLANATION<p>Verse 1. And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, signifies revelation from the Lord concerning the state of the church upon earth, what it is as to love and faith. These are what this chapter and the following treat of; therefore they are signified by "a sign in heaven, great and marvelous." That "a sign in heaven" signifies revelation from the Lord concerning heaven and the church and of their state, see above, (<a href="532.htm">532</a>, <a href="536.htm">536</a>); it is concerning love and faith, because it is called "great and marvelous;" and "great," in the Word, is said of such things as are of affection and love, and "marvelous," of such things as are of thought and of faith. </p>
