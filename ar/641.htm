<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>641.“他们所作的工也随着他们”表照着他们所爱和所信，随之所行和所言。“随着他们所作的工”表示死后留在人身上的一切事物。要知道，显现在人们面前的外在从内在得其本质、灵魂和生命，而内在并不显现在人们面前，但却显现在主和天使面前；前者和后者，或外在和内在合起来就是行为或所作的工；若内在处于爱和信，并且外在出于内在行事和说话，就是好行为或善行；若内在未处于爱和信，并且外在出于内在行事和说话，便是恶行。若外在貌似出于爱和信行事和说话，那么这些行为要么是虚伪的，要么是邀功的。十个人可以做出外在相同的行为，但这些行为并不相同，因为发出外在的内在并不相同。</p><p>谁看不出，有一个内在和一个外在，并且这二者合而为一？谁看不出，理解或认知和意愿是人的内在，言语和行为是他的外在？若没有理解或认知和意愿，谁能说话和行动？由于人人都能明白这一切，所以他也能看出，行为是外在的，同时也是内在的；既然外在从其内在得其本质、灵魂和生命，如前所述，那么可知，外在具有如它内在那样的性质；所以“随着他们所作的工”就是照着他们所爱和所信，随之所行和所言。好行为或善行就是仁与信（参看<a href="73.htm">73</a>，<a href="76.htm">76</a>，<a href="94.htm">94</a>，<a href="141.htm">141</a>节）；人的内在或内在人并不在于没有意愿的理解或认知，而在于意愿和由此而来的理解或认知；因此，它不在于没有爱的信，而在于爱和由此而来的信；行这些事就是人的外在或外在人（参看<a href="510.htm">510</a>节）。由此明显可知，“他们所作的工也随着他们”表照着他们所爱和所信，随之所行和所言。在以下经文中，“行为”所表相同：</p><p>在审判的日子，神必照各人的行为报应各人。（罗马书<a href="http://39-27.cn/罗2.5.htm">2:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/罗2.6.htm">6</a>）</p><p>我们众人必要在基督台前显露出来，叫各人按着本身所行的，或善或恶受报。（哥林多后书<a href="http://39-27.cn/林后5.10.htm">5:10</a>）</p><p>人子要在祂父的荣耀里降临，那时候，祂要照各人的行为报应各人。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.27.htm">16:27</a>）</p><p>行善的，复活得生命，作恶的，复活受审判。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.29.htm">5:29</a>）</p><p>他们都凭着这些案卷所记载的，照他们所行的受审判。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.12.htm">20:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>看哪，我必快来。赏赐在我，要照各人所行的报应他。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.12.htm">22:12</a>）</p><p>我要照你们的行为报应你们各人。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.23.htm">2:23</a>）</p><p>我知道你的行为。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.1.htm">2:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.26.htm">26</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.1.htm">3:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.7.htm">7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.14.htm">14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.19.htm">19</a>）</p><p>我也必照他们的行为，按他们手所做的报应他们。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.14.htm">25:14</a>）</p><p>耶和华定意，按我们的行径作为对付我们。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚1.6.htm">1:6</a>）</p><p>以及其它许多地方。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 641</h4><p>641. "For their works follow them." This symbolically means, according as they have loved and believed and so have done and spoken.<p>The works that follow them symbolize everything that remains in a person after death.<p>People know that the outward acts that people see take their essence, soul and life from internal origins that people do not see, but which are seen by the Lord and by angels. Both of these, outward acts and internal origins, taken together are works - good works if the internal origins are impelled by love and faith, and if people do their outward acts and speak in accordance with them, but evil works if the internal origins are not impelled by love and faith, and if people do their outward acts and speak in accordance with these. If they do outward acts and speak only seemingly in accord with love and faith, those works and words are either hypocritical or merit-seeking.<p>Ten people may do the same works in outward appearance, but still the works are not alike, because the internal origins which produce the outward actions are not alike.</p><p>[2] Who does not see that there is an internal self and an external one, and that these two operate in concert? For who does not see that the intellect and will constitute a person's internal self, and his speech and action his external self? Indeed, who can speak or act apart from his intellect and will? And because everyone sees this, everyone can also see that works consist of the external manifestation and internal origin together. Moreover, because the external manifestation takes its essence, soul and life from its internal origin, as already said, it follows that the external manifestation is of the same character as its internal origin, consequently that the works that follow people are such as they have loved and believed and so have done and spoken.<p>That good works embody charity and faith may be seen in nos. <a href="73.htm">73</a>, <a href="76.htm">76</a>, <a href="94.htm">94</a>, <a href="141.htm">141</a> above. And that a person's inner being or internal self does not consist in understanding without willing, but in willing and so understanding, consequently that it does not consist in believing without loving, but in loving and so believing, and that doing accordingly is a person's outward aspect or external self, may be seen in no. <a href="625.htm">625</a> above.</p><p>[3] It can be seen from this that the works that follow them means, symbolically, according as they have loved and believed and so have done and spoken.<p>Works have a similar symbolic meaning in the following passages:<p>...in the day of... judgment... God... will render to each one according to his works. (<a href="3927/romans_2_5.htm">Romans 2:5-6</a>)<p>...we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body..., whether good or evil. (<a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>)<p>...the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father..., and then He will reward each according to his works. (<a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>)<p>They shall come forth - those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, but those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment. (<a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>)<p>(They) were judged according to... the things which were written in the books..., each one according to his works. (<a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>)<p>Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to every one according to his work. (<a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>)<p>I will give to each one of you according to his works. (<a href="3927/revelation_2_23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>)<p>I know your works... (<a href="3927/revelation_2_1.htm">Revelation 2:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_2_4.htm">4-5</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_2_8.htm">8-9</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_2_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_2_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_2_26.htm">26</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_3_1.htm">3:1-3</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_3_7.htm">7-8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_3_14.htm">14-16</a>)<p>I will repay them according to their work and according to the doing of their hands. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>)<p>Jehovah... is dealing with us according to our ways and according to our works...

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 641</h4><p>641. 'For their works follow with them' signifies according as they have loved and believed, and thence done and spoken. By the 'works that follow them' are signified all the things that remain with a man after death. It is known that the external things that appear before men derive their essence, soul and life from internal things that do not appear before men but appear before the Lord and the angels. The latter and the former, or external and internal things taken together, are works; good works if the internal things are in love and faith, and they do and speak external things from them; but evil works if the internal things are not in love and faith, and they do and speak external things from them. If they do and speak external things as if out of love and faith, those works are either hypocritical or merit-seeking. Ten persons can do works similar in external things, but still they are dissimilar because the internal things out of which the external proceed are dissimilar.</p><p>[2] Who does not see that there is an internal and an external, and that these two make one? For who does not see that the understanding and the will are a man's internal, while speech and action are his external? For who is able to speak and act without the understanding and the will? And because everyone sees this, he can also see that works are the external and the internal together. And because the external derives its essence, soul and life from its own internal, as was said above, it follows that the external is of such a quality as is its internal, consequently that the 'works that follow with them' are according as they have loved and believed and thence done and spoken. That good works are charity and faith may be seen above (<a href="72.htm">72</a>, <a href="76.htm">76</a>, <a href="94.htm">94</a>, <a href="141.htm">141</a>); and that a man's internal or the internal man is not understanding without willing, but it is to will and thence understand, consequently that it is not believing without loving, but it is to love and thence believe; and that doing these things is a man's external or the external man may also be seen above (<a href="625.htm">625</a>). From these considerations it can be established that by 'the works that follow with them' is signified according as they have loved and believed and thence done and spoken. Similar things are signified by 'works' in the following places:<p>In the day of judgment God will render to each one in accordance with his works, <a href="3927/romans_2_6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>.<p>We shall all be discovered before the tribunal of Christ, that each may give an account of the things that he has don by the body, whether good or evil, <a href="3927/2-corinthians_5_10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>.<p>The Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father, and then shall render to each one in accordance with his works. <a href="3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>.<p>Those who have done goods shall go forth into the resurrection of life, but those who have done evils into the resurrection of judgment. <a href="3927/john_5_29.htm">John 5:29</a>.<p>They were judged in accordance with the things that have been written in the book, all in accordance with their works. <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>.<p>Behold, I am coming quickly and My reward is with Me, that I may give to each one in accordance with his works. <a href="3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>.<p>I will give to each one in accordance with his works. <a href="3927/revelation_2_23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>.<p>I know thy works. <a href="3927/revelation_2_1.htm">Revelation 2:1-2</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_2_4.htm">4</a>, [<a href="3927/revelation_2_5.htm">5</a>,] <a href="3927/revelation_2_8.htm">8</a>, [<a href="3927/revelation_2_9.htm">9</a>,] <a href="3927/revelation_2_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_2_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_2_26.htm">26</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_3_1.htm">3:1-3</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_3_7.htm">7-8</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_3_14.htm">14-15</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_3_19.htm">19</a>.<p>I will recompense them according to their own work, and according to the deed of their hands. <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>.<p>Jehovah does to us according to our ways and according to our works, <a href="3927/zechariah_1_6.htm">Zechariah 1:6</a>; and in many other places. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 641</h4><p>641. For their works follow with them, signifies as they have loved and believed, and thence have done and spoken. By "the works which follow with them" are signified all things which remain with man after death. It is known, that the externals, which appear before men, derive their essence, soul, and life from the internals, which do not appear before men, but which appear before the Lord and the angels; the latter and the former, or the externals and the internals taken together, are works; good works, if the internals are in love and faith, and the externals act and speak from them; but evil works, if the internals are not in love and faith, and the externals act and speak from them.

For who does not see that the understanding and will are the internal of man, and speech and action his external? For who can speak and act without the understanding and the will? And since everyone sees this, he may also see that works are external and internal at the same time; and because the external derives its essence, soul, and life from its internal, as was said above, it follows that the external is such as is its internal; consequently, that "the works which follow with them" are according as they have loved and believed, and thence have done and spoken.
