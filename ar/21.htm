<p>21.“归向神和祂父”表（他们）因此成为祂神性智慧和神性之爱的形像。“神和父”在灵义上非指两个人物，“神”是指智慧方面的神性，“父”指爱方面的神性。因为主里面有两样事物，即神性智慧与神性之爱，或说神性真理与神性良善。在旧约，这二者是指“神”和“耶和华”，在此是指“神”和“父”。由于主教导祂与父为一，祂在父里面，父在祂里面（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.30.htm">10:30</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.10.htm">14:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>），所以神与父不是指两个人物，而唯独指主。再者，神性是一且不可分割，故“耶稣基督使我们归向神和祂父作王和祭司”表示为了他们在主面前如同其神性智慧和神性之爱的形像。因为在人和天使里面，神的形像就在于这二者。在圣言中，本为一的神性以各种名字命名，这一点可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》。主自己也是父，这一点从以下经文明显看出来，以赛亚书：</p><p>因有一婴孩为我们而生，有一子赐给我们。祂名称为奇妙、神、勇士、永恒的父、和平的君！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.6.htm">9:6</a>）</p><p></p><p>耶和华啊，你是我们的父；从万亘古以来，你名称为我们的救赎主。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.16.htm">63:16</a>）</p><p>约翰福音：</p><p>你们若认识我，也就认识我的父。从今以后，你们认识祂，并且已经看见祂。人看见了我，就是看见了父。腓力对祂说，求主将父显给我们看。耶稣对他说，人看见了我，就是看见了父，你怎么说将父显给我们看呢？相信我，我在父里面，父在我里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.7.htm">14:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>）</p><p>可参看下文（<a href="960.htm">960</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 21</h4><p>21. To His God and Father. This symbolically means, thus images of His Divine wisdom and of His Divine love.<p>In the spiritual sense "God and Father" does not refer to two persons, but God means the Divine in respect to wisdom, and Father the Divine in respect to love. For the Lord has in Him two attributes: Divine wisdom and Divine love, or Divine truth and Divine good. These two are meant in the Old Testament by "God" and "Jehovah," and here by "God" and "Father."<p>Now because the Lord teaches that He and the Father are one, and that He is in the Father and the Father in Him (<a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">14:10-11</a>), therefore "God and Father" does not mean two persons, but the Lord alone. The Divine, moreover, is one and indivisible. Consequently the statement that Jesus Christ has made us kings and priests to His God and Father means, symbolically, that they appear before Him as images of His Divine wisdom and of His Divine love. The image of God consists in these two qualities in people and angels.<p>It may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord that the Divine, which in itself is one, is designated by various names in the Word.<p>That the Lord is also Himself the Father follows from the following declarations. In Isaiah:<p>...unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given..., (whose) name will be called Wonderful..., God, Mighty One, <sup>1</sup>Father of eternity, Prince of Peace. (<a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>)<p>In the same prophet:<p>You, Jehovah, are our Father, our Redeemer from everlasting is Your name. (<a href="3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>)<p>And in John:<p>"If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on you know Him and have seen Him."<p>Philip said to Him, "Lord, show us the Father...."<p>Jesus said to him, ."..He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how then can you say, 'Show us the Father'... ...Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me...." (<a href="3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7-9</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_11.htm">11</a>)<p>See no. <a href="962.htm">962</a> below.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The writer follows the rendering of Sebastian Schmidt here, though the word in the original Hebrew text is an adjective modifying "God," as it is interpreted in standard English translations. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 21</h4><p>21. 'Unto God and His Father' signifies thus [they are] images of His Divine Wisdom and of His Divine Love. By 'God and the Father' in the spiritual sense not two persons are understood, but by 'God' the Divine as to wisdom is understood, and by 'the Father' the Divine as to love. There are in fact two things in the Lord, Divine Wisdom and Divine Love or Divine Truth and Divine Good. In the Old Testament these two are understood by 'God' and 'Jehovah'; here, by 'God' and 'the Father.' Now since the Lord teaches that He and the Father are one, and that He is in the Father and the Father in Him (<a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>; <a href="3927/john_14_10.htm">14:10-11</a>), two persons are not understood by 'God' and 'the Father,' but only the Lord. Also the Divine is one and indivisible; therefore by [the statement] that Jesus Christ has made us kings and priests unto God and His Father is signified in order that in His presence they may appear to be images of His Divine Wisdom and Love. In these two likewise the image of God has its abode with men and angels. That the Divine, which in itself is one, is designated by various names in the Word, may be seen in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD. That the Lord Himself is also the Father, is established from these passages. In Isaiah:<p>Unto us a Boy is born, unto us a Son is given, Whose Name is Wonderful, GOD, Hero, THE FATHER OF ETERNITY, the Prince of Peace. <a href="3927/isaiah_9_1.htm">Isaiah 9</a>:[H.B. Isaiah ].<p>In the same:<p>Thou Jehovah art our Father, our Redeemer from an age is Thy Name. <a href="3927/isaiah_63_16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>.<p>And in John:<p>If you have known Me, you have known My Father also, and from henceforth you have known Him and seen Him. Philip says, Lord, show us the Father. Jesus says to him, He who has seen Me has seen the Father, how then sayest thou, Show us the Father? Believe Me, that I am in the Father and the Father in Me. <a href="3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7-9</a>, <a href="3927/john_14_11.htm">11</a>.<p>No. 960 below may be seen. </p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 21 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>21. "Deo at Patri Suo," significat ita imagines Divinae Suae Sapientiae, et Divini Sui Amoris. -Per "Deum" et "Patrem" in spirituali Sensu non intelliguntur duae Personae; sed per "Deum" intelligitur Divinum quoad Sapientiam, et per "Patrem" Divinum quoad Amorem: sunt enim duo in Domino, Divina Sapientia et Divinus Amor, seu Divinum Verum et Divinum Bonum; haec duo in Veteri Testamento intelliguntur per "Deum" et "Jehovam," hic per "Deum" et "Patrem." Nunc quia Dominus docet, quod Ipse et Pater unum sint, et quod Ipse in Patre, et Pater in Ipso, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_21/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_10_30" target=_top>Johannes 10:30</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_21/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_10-11" target=_top>14:10-11</a>), <p>non intelliguntur duae Personae per Deum et Patrem, sed solus Dominus: Divinum etiam est unum et individuum; quare per quod Jesus Christus "fecerit nos Reges et Sacerdotes Deo et Patri Suo," significatur ut appareant coram Ipso imagines Divinae Suae Sapientiae et Divini Sui Amoris; in illis duobus etiam consistit imago Dei apud homines et angelos. Quod Divinum, quod in Se unum est, variis nominibus insigniatur in Verbo, videatur in Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino. Quod Ipse Dominus etiam sit "Pater," constat ex his; apud Esajam: <p>"Puer natus est nobis, Filius datus est nobis, Cujus Nomen Mirabilis, Deus, Heros, Pater aeternitatis, Princeps pacis, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_21/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_9_5" target=_top>9:5</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_21/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_9_6" target=_top>6</a>)));<p>apud eundem: <p>"Tu Jehovah Pater noster, Redemptor noster a saeculo Nomen Tuum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_21/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_63_16" target=_top>63:16</a>);<p>et apud Johannem: <p>"Si cognovistis Me, etiam Patrem Meum cognovistis, et abhinc cognovistis Illum et vidistis Illum: dicit Philippus, Domine, monstra nobis Patrem: dicit illi Jesus, Qui vidit Me vidit Patrem, quomodo ergo tu dicis, monstra nobis Patrem; credite Mihi, quod Ego in Patre et Pater in Me," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_21/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_7-8" target=_top>14:7-8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_21/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_9" target=_top>9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_21/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_11" target=_top>11</a>);<p>videatur infra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_21/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_962" target=_top>962</a>). <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;962 pro "960" </p>
