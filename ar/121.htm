<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第121节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>121.“并赐他一块白石”表赞同并与良善结合的真理。“一块白石”之所以具有这样的含义，是因为过去人们收集小石头来投票表决，而白石表赞同票。“白石”之所以表赞同的真理，是因为“白”论及真理（<a href="167.htm">167</a>，<a href="379.htm">379</a>节）。所以，“白石”表赞同良善的真理，以及与良善结合的真理，因为良善吸引真理，与之结合。凡良善无不爱慕真理，并与诸如与其一致的真理结合，尤其是属天之爱的良善；这种良善与真理以合而为一的方式进行结合。因此，他们唯独通过良善来看待真理。这些人就是那些“律法写在心上”的人所指的。论到他们，耶利米书上记着说：</p><p>我要将我的律法放在他们当中，写在他们心上；他们各人不再教导自己的邻舍和自己的弟兄说，你该认识耶和华，因为所有人都必认识我。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.33.htm">31:33</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.34.htm">34</a>）</p><p>第三层天的所有天使都是如此。他们不通过任何记忆谈论真理，而是一听到别人谈论真理，尤其在阅读圣言时，就能清楚看到它们。原因在于，他们处于良善与真理的婚姻本身中。那些在世时唯独靠近主，并因遵行圣言的真理而做出善行之人就会变得如此。关于他们的一些情况，可参看《天堂与地狱》（<a href="../hh/25.htm">25</a>-26，<a href="../hh/270.htm">270</a>-271节）一书。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 121</h4><p>121. "'And I will give him a white stone.'" This symbolizes truths supportive of and united to good.<p>A white stone has this symbolism because in cases requiring decision, votes used to be tallied by collecting stones, and white stones meant affirming votes. Affirming truths are symbolized here, because whiteness is predicated of truths (nos. <a href="167.htm">167</a>, <a href="379.htm">379</a>). Consequently a white stone symbolizes truths supportive of good. It means also truths united to good, because goodness attracts truths and unites them to itself. Indeed, all good loves truth and joins to itself such truth as is in harmony with it, and especially so the goodness of celestial love. This so unites truth to itself that they form an indivisible whole.<p>For this reason celestial people view truths from the perspective of good. They are the people meant by those who have the law written on their hearts, of whom we read in Jeremiah:<p>I will put My law in the midst of them and write it on their hearts... No more shall each teach his companion, or each his brother, saying, "Know Jehovah," for everyone shall know Me... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>)<p>Of such a character are all the inhabitants of the third heaven. They do not talk about truths from some memory of them, but clearly see truths whenever they hear other people talking about them, and especially when they read the Word. That is because they possess a real marriage of goodness and truth.<p>People become of this character in the world if they have turned to the Lord alone and done good works because they accord with the Word's truths.<p>Something regarding these angels may be seen in the book Heaven and Hell, nos. <a href="25.htm">25</a>, <a href="26.htm">26</a>, <a href="270.htm">270</a>, <a href="271.htm">271</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 121</h4><p>121. 'And I will give him a little white stone' signifies truths favouring and united to good. 'A little white stone' has this signification because in trials votes used to be collected by means of little stones, and those that were affirmative by the white ones. Confirming truths are what are signified because white' is predicated of truths (<a href="167.htm">167</a>, <a href="379.htm">379</a>). Consequently by 'a little white stone' truths favouring good are signified, and those also united to good, because good summons them and unites them to itself. For every good loves truth and conjoins with itself such a truth as is in agreement, especially the good of celestial love: this unites the truth to itself in such a manner that they may altogether make a one. As a result they [who are in such good] see truths from good alone. These are understood by those who have the law inscribed on their hearts, of whom [it is said] in Jeremiah:<p>I will put My law in the midst of them, and I will write it upon their heart; and they shall teach no more everyone his companion, or everyone his brother, saying, Know Jehovah, for they shall all know Me. <a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>.<p>Such are all who are in the third heaven. They do not speak of truths out of any memory, but see them clearly while they hear others speaking of them, especially while they are reading the Word. This is because they are in the marriage itself of good and truth. Such do they become in the world, who have approached the Only Lord and done good works because they are in accordance with the truths of the Word; concerning whom some particulars may be seen in the work concerning <a href="../hh/25.htm">HEAVEN AND HELL 25-26</a>, <a href="../hh/270.htm">270-271</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 121</h4><p>121. And I will give him a white stone, signifies truths favoring and united to good. "A white stone" signifies this because in judgments votes were collected by stones, and by white stones those which were affirmative; that it is affirmative truths which are signified is, because "white" is predicated of truths, (<a href="167.htm">167</a>[1-2], <a href="379.htm">379</a>[1-7]). Once it is, that by a "white stone" are signified truths favoring good; the reason why they are also united to good, is, because good invites and unites them to itself; for all good loves truth and conjoins to itself such as agrees with itself, especially the good of celestial love; this so unites truths to itself, that they altogether make a one. Hence it is, that they see truths from good alone. These are meant by "those who have the law written in their hearts," of whom it is said in Jeremiah:<p>I will put My law in the midst of them, and I will write it on their heart; neither shall they teach any longer everyone his neighbor, and everyone his brother, saying, Know ye Jehovah, for all shall know Me, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>).<p>Such are all who are in the third heaven. They do not speak of truths from any memory, but clearly see them when they hear others speaking of them, especially when they are reading the Word; the reason is, because they are in the very marriage of good and truth. Such do they become in the world, who have approached the Lord alone, and have done good works, because they are according to the truths of the Word; concerning whom something may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, (<a href="25.htm">25-26</a>, <a href="270.htm">270-271</a>). </p>

"Et dabo illi calculum album," significat vera suffragantia et unita bono. - "Calculus albus" id significat, quia in judiciis colligebantur suffragia per calculos, et per albos illa quae confirmabant; quod sint vera confirmantia quae significantur, est quia "album" praedicatur de veris (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_121/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_167" target=_top>167</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_121/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_379" target=_top>379</a>); inde est, quod per "calculum album" significentur vera suffragantia bono; quod etiam unita bono, est quia bonum arcessit illa, et unit sibi: omne enim bonum amat verum, ac sibi conjungit tale quod sibi convenit, imprimis bonum amoris caelestis; hoc sibi ita unit verum, ut prorsus unum faciant; inde est quod videant vera ex solo bono: hi intelliguntur per "illos qui habent legem cordibus suis inscriptam," de quibus apud Jeremiam: <p>"Dabo legem Meam in medio eorum, et super cor eorum scribam eam neque docebunt amplius quis socium suum, aut quis fratrem suum dicendo cognoscite Jehovam, omnis enim cognoscet Me," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_121/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_31_1-40" target=_top>Jeremias 31</a>:(<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_121/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_31_33" target=_top>33</a>,) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_121/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_31_34" target=_top>34</a>).<p>Tales sunt omnes qui in tertio Caelo sunt; illi non ex aliqua memoria loquuntur de veris, sed clare vident illa dum audiunt alios de veris loquentes, imprimis dum legunt Verbum; causa est, quia sunt in ipso conjugio boni et veri: tales fiunt in Mundo, qui adiverunt solum Dominum, et fecerunt bona opera, quia sunt secundum vera Verbi: de quibus videantur aliqua in Opere De <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_121/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_25" target=_top>Caelo et Inferno 25</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_121/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_26" target=_top>26</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_121/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_270" target=_top>270</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_121/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_271" target=_top>271</a>. </p>
