<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>637.“那些拜兽和兽像受他名之印记的，昼夜不得安宁”表对那些承认并接受这信，确认它，并照之生活的人来说，持续处于令人不快的事物中的状态。“昼夜不得安宁”表示他们死后持续处于令人不快的事物中的状态，因为刚才经上论及他们的痛苦。“昼夜”表示所有时间；在属灵之义上表示处于一切状态，因而持续不断，因为“昼夜”在属灵之义上表示生命的状态（<a href="101.htm">101</a>，<a href="476.htm">476</a>节）。“拜兽和兽像受他名之印记”表示承认这信，接受这信之教义，在自己里面确认它，并照该教义生活（参看<a href="634.htm">634</a>节），那里说了同样的话。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 637</h4><p>637. "And they will have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name." This symbolizes the continuing state of vexations in people who acknowledge and accept that faith, affirm it, and live in accordance with it.<p>To have no rest day or night symbolizes those people's continuing state of vexations after death, because their torment was just predicted in the preceding declaration. Day or night means for all time, and symbolically, in the spiritual sense, through every state, thus continually; for day and night in that sense symbolize states of life (nos. <a href="101.htm">101</a>, <a href="476.htm">476</a>).<p>That to worship the beast and its image and receive the mark of its name means, symbolically, to acknowledge that faith, to accept its doctrine, to affirm it in oneself, and to live in accordance with it, may be seen in no. <a href="634.htm">634</a> above, where a similar statement occurs. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 637</h4><p>637. 'And they shall not have rest day and night adoring the beast and his image, and if anyone accepts the mark of his name' signifies a perpetual state in things undelightful in the case of those who acknowledge that faith and receive its doctrine, confirm it, and live in accordance therewith. By 'not to have rest day and night' is signified their perpetual state in things undelightful after death, because just before it has spoken of their torment. By 'day and night' is signified all the time, and in the spiritual sense in every state, thus perpetually, for 'day and night' in that sense signify the states of life (<a href="101.htm">101</a>, <a href="476.htm">476</a>). That by 'to adore the beast and his image, and accept the mark of his name' is signified to acknowledge that faith, receive its doctrine, confirm it with oneself and live in accordance therewith may be seen above (<a href="634.htm">634</a>) where similar things are said. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 637</h4><p>637. And they shall have no rest day and night, who adore the beast and his image, and if anyone shall have received the mark of his name, signifies a perpetual state of things undelightful with those who acknowledge that faith and receive its doctrine, confirm it and live according to it. By "having no rest day and night," is signified their perpetual state in things undelightful after death, because just before it speaks of their torment. By "day and night" is signified all time; and, in the spiritual sense, in every state, thus perpetually, for "day and night" in that sense signify states of life, (<a href="101.htm">101</a>[1-3], <a href="476.htm">476</a>). That by "adoring the beast and his image, and receiving the mark of his name," is signified to acknowledge that faith, receive its doctrine, confirm it in oneself, and live according to it, may be seen above, (<a href="634.htm">634</a>), where similar things are said. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 637 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>637. "Et non habebunt requiem diu et noctu adorantes Bestiam et imaginem ejus, et si quis acceperit characterem nominis ejus," significat statum perpetuum in injucundis apud illos qui agnoscunt illam fidem et recipiunt doctrinam ejus, confirmant illam, et vivunt secundum illam.--Per "non habere requiem diu et noctu" significatur status illorum perpetuus in injucundis post mortem, quia mox prius dicitur de cruciatu illorum: per "diu et noctu" significatur omni tempore, et in spirituali Sensu in omni statu, ita perpetuo, nam "dies" et "nox" in eo Sensu significant status vitae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_637/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_101" target=_top>101</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_637/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_476" target=_top>476</a>). Quod per "adorare Bestiam et imaginem ejus, et accipere characterem nominis ejus" significetur agnoscere illam fidem, recipere doctrinam ejus, confirmare illam apud se, et vivere secundum illam, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_637/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_634" target=_top>634</a>), ubi similia dicuntur. </p>
