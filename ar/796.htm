<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第796节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>796.启18:23.“灯光在你中间决不能再照耀”表那些因教义和照之的生活陷入天主教的人没有来自主的任何启示，因而没有对属灵真理的洞察。“灯光”表示来自主的启示，因而对属灵真理的接受；“光”是指天堂之光，天使，以及世人的理解或认知就在天堂之光中；这光本质上是神性智慧；因为它从显为灵界太阳的主发出，这光实质上是神性智慧的神性之爱；从这太阳所发出的光无非是神性智慧，所发出的热无非是神性之爱。事实的确如此，这一点在《圣爱与圣智》（<a href="../dlw/83.htm">83</a>-172节）一书得到论证。由于这光来自主，而主凭这光并在这光中全在，所以一切启示、因而对属灵真理的洞察皆通过这光实现，那些属灵地热爱神性真理，也就是因为它们是真理，因而是神性而热爱真理的人就拥有对属灵真理的洞察。显然，这就是对主的爱；事实上，主在这光中全在，因为神性之爱和神性智慧不在空间内，而在它们被接受之处，并取决于接受程度。</p><p>那些陷入天主教的人没有任何启示，因而没有对神性真理的洞察；这一点从以下事实明显可知：他们不爱任何属灵之光；因为属灵之光的源头来自主，如前所述；除了那些与主结合的人外，没有人认可这光，也不接受它；与主结合唯独通过对祂的承认和敬拜，同时通过遵行其圣言诫命的生活才能实现。承认和敬拜主，并阅读圣言，会引起主的临在；不过，这二者连同遵行其诫命的生活则实现与主的结合。而在巴比伦，情况刚好相反；主在那里得到承认，却没有权柄；圣言得到承认，却没有人阅读它。那里敬拜的是教皇，而不是主，承认的是教皇诏书，而不是圣言，他们照着教皇诏书，而不是圣言的诫命生活。这些教皇诏书以教皇及其神父对天堂和世界的统治为目的，而圣言的诫命以主对天堂和世界的统治为目的；这两个目的就像地狱与天堂那样彼此截然对立。提及这些事，是叫人们知道，那些因教义和照之的生活陷入天主教的人完全没有灯光，也就是没有启示，因而没有对属灵真理的洞察。</p><p>主就是光，一切启示和对属灵真理的洞察皆由此而来；这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>祂是真光，照亮一切来到在世上的人。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.4.htm">1:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.12.htm">12</a>）</p><p>这论及主。</p><p>这就是审判，光来到世间；行真理的必来就光。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.19.htm">3:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.21.htm">21</a>）</p><p>耶稣说，光在你们中间还有不多的时候，应当趁着有光行走，免得黑暗临到你们；你们应当趁着有光，信从这光，使你们成为光明之子。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.35.htm">12:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.36.htm">36</a>）</p><p>耶稣说，我到世上来，乃是光，叫凡信我的，不住在黑暗里。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约 12.46.htm"> 12:46</a>）</p><p>耶稣说，我是世上的光。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.5.htm">9:5</a>）</p><p>西缅说，我的眼睛已经看见你的救恩，是照亮各族的光。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.30.htm">2:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.32.htm">32</a>）</p><p>那坐在黑暗里的百姓看见了大光；坐在死荫之地的人有光发现照着他们。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太 4.16.htm"> 4:16</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.2.htm">9:2</a>）</p><p>我已经使你作各族的光，叫你施行我的救恩，直到地极。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.6.htm">49:6</a>）</p><p>新耶路撒冷城不用日月光照，因有神的荣耀光照，又有羔羊为城的灯。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启 21.23.htm"> 21:23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.5.htm">22:5</a>）</p><p>从这些经文明显可知，主就是那光，一切启示和对属灵真理的洞察皆来自这光；主既是光，魔鬼就是黑暗；魔鬼就是对统治主的一切神性事物，因而统治主自己之爱；并且统治权越给予它，它就越将主的神圣神性事物变暗、熄灭、点燃并烧尽。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 796</h4><p>796. <a href="3927/revelation_18_23.htm">18:23</a> "The light of a lamp shall not shine in you anymore." This symbolically means that those caught up in the Roman Catholic religion because of its doctrine and a life in accordance with it are without any enlightenment from the Lord and so without any perception of spiritual truth.<p>The light of a lamp symbolizes enlightenment by the Lord and a consequent perception of spiritual truth. That is because the light means the light of heaven, which is the light angels have, and people, too, as regards their intellect, because the light in its essence is Divine wisdom. For it emanates from the Lord as the sun of the spiritual world, which in its essence is the Divine love in Divine wisdom, and the only light that can emanate from it is the light of Divine wisdom, and the only warmth the warmth of Divine love. The reality of this is something we showed in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom, nos. <a href="../dlw/83.htm">83-172</a>.<p>Since that light comes from the Lord, and the Lord is omnipresent in it and by means of it, therefore it is the means of all enlightenment and the consequent perception of spiritual truth, a perception that those people have who love Divine truths spiritually, that is, who love Divine truths because they are true, thus because they are Divine. Plainly this is what it is to love the Lord. For the Lord is omnipresent in that light, inasmuch as Divine love and wisdom do not exist in space, but are present wherever they are received, in accordance with their reception.</p><p>[2] That people caught up in the Roman Catholic religion are without any enlightenment and so without any perception of spiritual truth, can be seen from the fact that they have no love for any spiritual light. For as we said, spiritual light originates from the Lord, and the only people who can receive and accept that light are people conjoined with the Lord, and conjunction with the Lord is achieved solely by an acknowledgment and worship of Him, and at the same time by a life in accordance with His commandments from the Word. An acknowledgment and worship of the Lord and reading the Word bring about the Lord's presence, but it is these two things combined at the same time with a life in accordance with His precepts that bring about a conjunction with Him.<p>The opposite is the case in Roman Catholicism. The Lord is acknowledged in it, but without His having any dominion, and the Word is acknowledged without its being read. Instead of the Lord they worship the Pope, and instead of the Word they acknowledge papal bulls, and live according to those bulls, and not according to the commandments in the Word. The bulls, moreover, have as their goal the dominion of the Pope and his ministers over heaven and the world, while the commandments in the Word have as their goal the dominion of the Lord over heaven and the world. These two goals are as diametrically opposed to each other as heaven and hell.<p>We have said this much for it to be known that people caught up in the Roman Catholic religion because of its doctrine and a life in accordance with it are without the least light of a lamp, that is to say, without any enlightenment from the Lord and so without any perception of spiritual truth.</p><p>[3] That the Lord is the light that produces all enlightenment and perception of spiritual truth is apparent from the following:<p>He was the true light which enlightens every person coming into the world. (<a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">John 1:4-12</a>)<p>This in reference to the Lord.<p>This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world... Whoever does the truth comes to the light... (<a href="3927/john_3_19.htm">John 3:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_21.htm">21</a>)<p>Jesus said..., "A little while longer the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you... While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be children of light." (<a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">John 12:35-36</a>)<p>(Jesus said,) "I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in Me should not abide in darkness." (<a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">John 12:46</a>)<p>(Jesus said,) ."..I am the light of the world." (<a href="3927/john_9_5.htm">John 9:5</a>)<p>(Simeon said,) ."..my eyes have seen Your salvation..., a light for revelation to the Gentiles...." (<a href="3927/luke_2_30.htm">Luke 2:30-32</a>)<p>The people sitting in darkness have seen a great light; upon those sitting in the region and shadow of death, light has arisen. (<a href="3927/matthew_4_16.htm">Matthew 4:16</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_9_2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>)<p>I have given You as a light to the Gentiles, that You should be My salvation to the ends of the earth. (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>)<p>The city (New Jerusalem) has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminates it, and its lamp is the Lamb. (<a href="3927/revelation_21_23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>, cf. <a href="3927/revelation_22_5.htm">22:5</a>)<p>It is apparent from this that the Lord is the light that produces all enlightenment and the consequent perception of spiritual truth. And because the Lord is the light, the Devil is darkness. The Devil is also the love of exercising dominion over all the Divine sanctities belonging to the Lord, and over the Lord Himself; and to the extent it achieves that dominion, it darkens, extinguishes, sets on fire and burns up the Divine sanctities belonging to the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 796</h4><p>796. [verse 23] 'And the light of a lamp shall not shine in thee any more' signifies that those who are in that form of religion by virtue of doctrine and a life in accordance therewith do not have any enlightenment from the Lord, nor consequently any perception of spiritual truth. By 'the light of a lamp' is signified enlightenment from the Lord, and consequently a perception of spiritual truth; for by 'the light' is understood the light of heaven in which angels are, and men also as to the understanding. This light in its essence is Divine Wisdom, for it proceeds from the Lord as the Sun of the spiritual world, and this in its own substance is Divine Love of Divine Wisdom out of which no other light can proceed than that which is of Divine Wisdom, nor any other heat than that which is of Divine Love. That this is the case has been demonstrated in <a href="../dlw/83.htm">ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM 83-172</a>. Since that light is from the Lord, and the Lord by means of it and in it is omnipresent, therefore by its means all enlightenment is effected, and consequently the perception of spiritual truth which those have who love Divine Truths spiritually, that is, who love truths because they are true, thus because they are Divine. That this is to love the Lord, is plain; for the Lord is omnipresent in that light, because Divine Love and Wisdom are not in space but are where they are received and in accordance with the reception.</p><p>[2] That those who are in the Roman Catholic form of religion do not have any enlightenment and consequent perception of spiritual truth can be established from the fact that they do not love any spiritual light. For the origin of spiritual light is from the Lord, as has been said, and no others can accept or receive that light but those who have been conjoined with the Lord; and conjunction with the Lord is effected solely by the acknowledgment and worship of Him, and at the same time by a life in accordance with His precepts out of the Word. The acknowledgment and worship of the Lord and the reading of the Word bring about the Lord's presence, but those two together with a life in accordance with His precepts effect a conjunction with Him. In Babylon it is the contrary; there the Lord is acknowledged, but without dominion, and the Word is acknowledged, but without the reading of it. Instead of the Lord the pope is worshipped there, and in place of the Word papal bulls are acknowledged. They live in accordance with these and not in accordance with the precepts of the Word. Also those bulls have for an end the dominion of the pope and his ministers over heaven and the world, whereas the precepts of the Word have for an end the Lord's dominion over heaven and the world; and the latter and the former are diametrically opposite to each other, like hell and heaven. These things have been said so that it may be known that there is no 'light of a lamp' at all, that is, no enlightenment and consequent perception of spiritual truth, with those who are in the Babylonish form of religion by virtue of doctrine and a life in accordance therewith.</p><p>[3] That the Lord is 'the Light' out of which there is all enlightenment and perception of spiritual truth is plain from these statements:<p>He was the true Light, which enlightens every man coming into the world John 4-12.<p>These [words were said] of the Lord.<p>This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world; he who does the truth comes to the Light. <a href="3927/john_1_19.htm">John 1:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_21.htm">21</a>.<p>Jesus said, Yet a little while is the Light with you; walk while you have the Light, lest darkness seize upon you: while you have the Light believe in the Light, that you may be sons of the Light. <a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">John 12:35-36</a>,<p>Jesus said, I the Light have come into the world, that every one who believes in Me may not remain in darkness. <a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">John 12:46</a>.<p>Jesus said, lam the Light of the world. <a href="3927/john_9_5.htm">John 9:5</a>.<p>Simeon said, Mine eyes have seen Thy Salvation, the Light for the revelation pertaining to the nations. <a href="3927/luke_2_30.htm">Luke 2:30-32</a>.<p>The people sitting in darkness has seen the great Light, to those sitting in the region and shadow of death the Light has arisen. <a href="3927/matthew_4_16.htm">Matthew 4:16</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_9_2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/isaiah_9_1.htm">1</a>].<p>I will give Thee for the Light of the nations, that Thou mayest be My salvation to the extremity of the land. <a href="3927/isaiah_49_6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>.<p>The city New Jerusalem has no need of the sun and the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God enlightens it, and the Lamp thereof is the Lamb. <a href="3927/revelation_21_23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_5.htm">22:5</a>.<p>It is plain from these statements that the Lord is the Light out of which there is all enlightenment and the consequent perception of truth; and because the Lord is the Light, the devil is a dense darkness. And the devil is the love of dominating over all the holy Divine things of the Lord, and thus over Him; and in proportion as dominion is given to that love, so far it darkens, extinguishes, sets on fire and burns up the holy Divine things of the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 796</h4><p>796. Verse 23. And the light of a lamp shall not shine in thee anymore signifies that they who are in that religious persuasion from doctrine and from a life according to it, have no enlightenment from the Lord, and thence no perception of spiritual truth. By "the light of a lamp" is signified enlightenment from the Lord and thence the perception of spiritual truth; for by "light" is meant the light of heaven, in which the angels are, and men also as to the understanding; which light in its essence is the Divine wisdom; for it proceeds from the Lord as the sun of the spiritual world, which in its substance is the Divine love of the Divine wisdom; from which no other light can proceed than that which is of the Divine wisdom, nor any other heat than that which is of the Divine love. That it is so, is demonstrated in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom, (<a href="83.htm">83-172</a>). Since that light is from the Lord, and the Lord is omnipresent by it and in it, therefore all enlightenment is effected by it, and thence the perception of spiritual truth, which those have who love Divine truths spiritually, that is, who love truths because they are truths, thus because they are Divine. That this is to love the Lord, is manifest; for the Lord is omnipresent in that light, because the Divine love and the Divine wisdom are not in place, but are where they are received, and according to the reception.</p><p>[2] That they who are in the Roman Catholic religious persuasion have not any enlightenment, and perception of spiritual truth thence, may be evident from this, that they do not love any spiritual light; for the origin of spiritual light is from the Lord, as was said; and no others can accept that light, nor receive it, but they who are conjoined with the Lord; and conjunction with the Lord is effected solely by the acknowledgment and worship of Him, and at the same time by a life according to His commandments from the Word. The acknowledgment and worship of the Lord, and the reading of the Word, cause the presence of the Lord; but these two together with a life according to His commandments effect conjunction with Him. In Babylon it is the contrary; there the Lord is acknowledged, but without dominion; and the Word is acknowledged, but without the reading of it. Instead of the Lord the pope is there worshiped, and instead of the Word the papal bulls are acknowledged, according to which they live, and not according to the commandments of the Word. And those bulls have for their end the dominion of the pope and his ministers over heaven and the world, and the commandments of the Word have for their end the Lord's dominion over heaven and the world; and these are diametrically opposite to each other, like hell and heaven. These things are said, that it may be known, that they have altogether no light of a lamp, that is, enlightenment, and thence the perception of spiritual truth, who are in the Babylonish religious persuasion from doctrine and from a life according to it.</p><p>[3] That the Lord is the Light, from which is all the enlightenment and perception of spiritual truth, is manifest from these passages:<p>He was the true Light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world, (<a href="3927/john_1_4.htm">John 1:4-12</a>).<p>This is concerning the Lord:<p>This is the judgment, that the Light is come into the world; he that doeth the truth cometh to the Light, (<a href="3927/john_3_19.htm">John 3:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_3_21.htm">21</a>).<p>Jesus said, Yet a little while is the Light with you; walk while ye have the Light, lest darkness seize upon you; while ye have the Light, believe in the Light, that ye may be sons of the Light, (<a href="3927/john_12_35.htm">John 12:35-36</a>).<p>Jesus said, I am come a Light into the world, that everyone who believeth in Me, may not abide in darkness, (<a href="3927/john_12_46.htm">John 12:46</a>).<p>Jesus said, I am the Light of the world, (<a href="3927/john_9_5.htm">John 9:5</a>).<p>Simeon said, Mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, a Light for the revelation of the nations, (<a href="3927/luke_2_30.htm">Luke 2:30-32</a>).<p>The people sitting in darkness have seen a great Light; and to them that sit in the region and shadow of death, Light has arisen, (<a href="3927/matthew_4_16.htm">Matthew 4:16</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_9_2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>).<p>I have given thee for a Light of the nations, that thou mayest be My salvation even unto the extremity of the earth, (<a href="3927/isaiah_49_6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<p>The city New Jerusalem hath no need of the sun and moon to shine in it, for the glory of God enlighteneth it, and the lamp of it is the Lamb, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_5.htm">22:5</a>).<p>It is manifest from these passages, that the Lord is the Light, from which are all enlightenment and thence perception of truth; and because the Lord is the Light, the devil is thick darkness; and the devil is the love of ruling over all the holy Divine things of the Lord, and thus over Himself; and as far as dominion is given to it, so far it darkens, extinguishes, sets on fire, and burns up, the holy Divine things of the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 796 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>796. (Vers. 23.) "Et lux lucernae non lucebit in te amplius," significat quod illis qui in Religioso isto ex doctrina et ex vita secundum illam sunt, non sit aliqua illustratio a Domino et inde perceptio veri spiritualis.--Per "lucem lucernae" significatur illustratio a Domino et inde perceptio veri spiritualis; per "lucem" enim intelligitur Lux Caeli, in qua sunt angeli, et quoque homines quoad intellectum, quae Lux in sua essentia est Divina Sapientia; nam procedit a Domino ut Sole mundi spiritualis, qui in sua substantia est Divinus Amor Divinae Sapientiae, ex quo non alia Lux potest procedere quam quae est Divinae Sapientiae, nec alius Calor quam qui est Divini Amoris; quod ita sit, in Sapientia Angelica de Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_796/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_83" target=_top>83-172</a>), demonstratum est. Quoniam Lux illa est a Domino, et Dominus per illam et in illa est omnipraesens, ideo per illam fit omnis illustratio, et inde perceptio veri spiritualis, quae est illis qui spiritualiter amant Divina Vera, hoc est, qui amant vera quia vera sunt, ita quia Divina. Quod hoc sit amare Dominum, patet; est enim Dominus in illa Luce omnipraesens, quia Divinus Amor et Divina Sapientia non sunt in loco, sed sunt ubi recipiuntur et secundum receptionem. Quod illis, qui in Religioso Catholico. Romano sunt, non sit aliqua illustratio et inde perceptio veri spiritualis, constare potest ex eo, quod non aliquam lucem spiritualem ament; origo enim lucis spiritualis est a Domino, ut dictum est, et non alii illam lucem possunt accipere, nec recipere, quam qui conjuncti sunt Domino et conjunctio cum Domino fit unice per agnitionem et cultum Ipsius, et simul per vitam secundum praecepta Ipsius e Verbo. Agnitio et cultus Domini et lectio Verbi faciunt praesentiam Domini, at illa duo simul cum vita secundum praecepta Ipsius faciunt conjunctionem cum Ipso. In Babylone est contrarium; agnoscitur ibi Dominus, sed absque dominio; et agnoscitur Verbum sed absque lectione ejus; vice Domini ibi colitur Papa, et loco Verbi agnoscuntur Bullae papales, secundum quas vivitur, et non secundum praecepta Verbi; et Bullae illae pro fine habent dominium Papae et Ministrorum ejus super Caelum et Mundum, et praecepta Verbi pro fine habent dominium Domini super Caelum et Mundum; et haec et illa sibi e diametro opposita sunt, sicut Infernum et Caelum. Haec dicta sunt, ut sciatur quod prorsus nulla lux lucernae, hoc est, illustratio et inde perceptio veri spiritualis, sit illis qui in Religioso Babylonico ex doctrina et ex vita secundum illam sunt. Quod Dominus sit Lux, ex qua omnis illustratio et perceptio veri spiritualis est, patet ex his: <p>"Lux vera erat, quae illuminat omnem hominem venientem in mundum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_796/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_4-12" target=_top>Johannes 1:4-12</a>);<p>haec de Domino. <p>"Hoc est judicium, quod Lux venit in mundum; qui facit veritatem, venit ad Lucem," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_796/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_3_19" target=_top>Johannes 3:19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_796/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_3_21" target=_top>21</a>);<p>"Jesus dixit, Adhuc breve tempus Lux vobiscum est; ambulate quousque Lucem habetis, ne tenebrae vos apprehendant: quousque Lucem habetis, credite in Lucem, ut filii Lucis sitis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_796/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_35-36" target=_top>Johannes 12:35-36</a>);<p>Jesus dixit, "Ego Lux in mundum veni, ut omnis qui credit in Me, in tenebris non maneat," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_796/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_46" target=_top>Johannes 12:46</a>);<p>Jesus dixit, "Ego Lux mundi sum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_796/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_9_5" target=_top>Johannes 9:5</a>);<p>Simeon dixit, "Viderunt oculi mei Salutare Tuum, Lucem in revelationem gentium," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_796/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_2_30-32" target=_top>Luca 2:30-32</a>);<p>"Populus sedens in tenebris vidit Lumen magnum; sedentibus in regione et umbra mortis, Lux exorta est," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_796/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_4_16" target=_top>Matthaeus 4:16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_796/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_9_1" target=_top>Esaias 9:1</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_796/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_9_2" target=_top>2</a>));<p>"Dedi Te in Lucem gentium, ut sis Salus Mea usque ad extremitatem terrae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_796/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_49_6" target=_top>Esaias 49:6</a>);<p>"Urbs" Nova Hierosolyma "non opus habet sole et luna ut luceant in illa, gloria enim Dei illustrat illam, et Lucerna ejus Agnus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_796/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_23" target=_top>Apocalypsis 21:23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_796/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_22_5" target=_top>22:5</a>).<p>Ex his patet, quod Dominus sit Lux ex qua omnis illustratio et inde perceptio veri: et quia Dominus est Lux, est Diabolus Caligo; et Diabolus est Amor dominandi super omnia Sancta Divina Domini, ac ita super Ipsum; et quantum datur illi dominium, tantum Sancta Divina Domini caligat, exstinguit, succendit et exurit. </p>
