<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第761节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>761.启18:5.“因她的罪恶滔天，她的不义神已经想起来了”表他们的邪恶与虚假侵扰众天堂，主将保护这些天堂免遭由此而来的暴行。“因她的罪恶滔天”表示他们的邪恶与虚假侵扰天上的天使。“她的不义神已经想起来了”表示主将保护众天堂免遭由此而来的暴行。这些话之所以表示这些事，是因为众天堂中的一切事物都是良善与真理，而地狱中的一切事物都是邪恶与虚假；因此，天堂与地狱完全隔离，处于互相对立的位置，就像相对的两极；所以邪恶与虚假不能抵达天堂。然而，当邪恶与虚假不断增多，甚至超出这种对立的程度，并由此超出一个合理的度时，众天堂就会受侵扰。这时，若非主通过自己所发出的更强大的流注来保护众天堂，那么暴行就会临到众天堂；当这种情形达到极点时，主就会施行最后的审判，从而解救他们。因此缘故，在本章下文，以及下一章（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.1.htm">19:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.9.htm">9</a>）和耶利米书，经上说：</p><p>天哪，你们都要因她欢喜。因为神已经在她身上伸了你们的冤。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.20.htm">18:20</a>）</p><p>耶利米书：</p><p>那时，天地和其中所有的，必因巴比伦欢呼，因为行毁灭的要来到她那里。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 51.48.htm"> 51:48</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 761</h4><p>761. <a href="3927/revelation_18_5.htm">18:5</a> "For her sins have mounted even to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities." This symbolically means that their evils and falsities infest the heavens, but the Lord will protect the heavens from being violated by them.<p>Her sins having mounted even to heaven means symbolically that their evils and falsities infest angels in heaven. God's remembering her iniquities means symbolically that the Lord will protect the heavens from being violated by them.<p>This is the symbolic meaning of these words, because everything in the heavens is good and true, and everything in the hells is evil and false. The heavens and hells are therefore completely apart and in an inverse situation, like antipodes. Consequently evils and falsities cannot mount to the heavens. But still, when evils and falsities increase beyond the degrees of opposition and so beyond a just measure, the heavens are infested, and unless the Lord protects the heavens then, which He does by a stronger influx emanating from Him, violence is done to the heavens. And when this reaches its peak, He then executes a last judgment and so liberates them.<p>So we are told later in this chapter, "Rejoice over her, O heaven..., for God has visited your judgment on her!" (verse <a href="3927/revelation_18_20.htm">20</a>) - an exultation expressed in the following chapter, <a href="3927/revelation_19_1.htm">Revelation 19:1-9</a>. And in Jeremiah:<p>Then the heavens and the earth shall sing over Babylon, and all that is in them, when the plunderers shall come upon her... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_48.htm">Jeremiah 51:48</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 761</h4><p>761. [verse 5] 'For her sins have reached even unto heaven, and God has remembered her injustices' signifies that their evils and untruths are infesting the heavens, and that the Lord is going to protect these [heavens] from the violence thence. By her sins having reached even unto the heavens is signified that their evils and untruths are infesting the angels of heaven. By God having remembered her injustices is signified that the Lord is going to protect the heavens from the violence thence. These things are signified by those words because all things in the heavens are goods and truths and all things in the hells are evils and untruths, and consequently the heavens and the hells have been entirely separated and are in an inverted position like the antipodes; and therefore evils and untruths are unable to reach to the heavens. Nevertheless, when evils and untruths are multiplied beyond the degrees of opposition, and thence beyond a just measure, the heavens are infested. And unless the Lord then protects the heavens, which is done by means of a stronger influx from Himself, violence is brought upon the heavens; and when this has reached its height, He then effects a last judgment, and thus they are delivered. On this account it follows on in this chapter (verse 20):<p>Exult over her, O heaven, for God has judged your judgment upon her, and in the following chapter <a href="3927/revelation_19_1.htm">Revelation 19</a> (verse <a href="3927/revelation_19_1.htm">1-9</a>). In Jeremiah also:<p>Then shall the heavens and the earth and everything that is therein sing over Babel, when the wasters shall come upon her. <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_48.htm">51:48</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 761</h4><p>761. Verse 5. For her sins have reached even unto heaven, and God hath remembered her injustices, signifies that their evils and falsities infest the heavens, and that the Lord will protect these from violence thence. By "her sins have reached to the heavens" is signified that their evils and falsities infest the angels of heaven. By "God hath remembered her injustices," is signified that the Lord will protect the heavens from violence thence. This is signified by these words, because all things in the heavens are goods and truths, and all things in the hells are evils and falsities; and thence the heavens and the hells are altogether separated, and in an inverted position like the antipodes; wherefore evils and falsities cannot reach to the heavens. But yet, when evils and falsities are multiplied beyond the degrees of opposition, and thus beyond a just measure, the heavens are infested; and unless the Lord then protects the heavens, which is effected by a more powerful influx from Himself, violence is offered to the heavens; and when this has come to its height, He then executes the Last Judgment, and thus they are liberated. Hence it is, that it follows in this chapter:<p>Exult over her, O heaven, because God hath judged your judgment upon her, (<a href="3927/revelation_18_20.htm">Revelation 18:20</a>).<p>And in the following chapter, (<a href="3927/revelation_19_1.htm">Revelation 19:1-9</a>); and in Jeremiah:<p>Then shall the heavens and the earth and all that is in them sing over Babel, when the wasters shall come upon her, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_48.htm">Jeremiah 51:48</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 761 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>761. (Vers. 5.) "Quoniam pertigerunt ejus peccata usque ad Caelum, et recordatus est Deus injustitiarum ejus," significat quod mala et falsa eorum infestent Caelos, et quod hos Dominus a violentia inde tutaturus sit. -Per quod "peccata ejus pertigerint ad Caelos," significatur quod mala et falsa illorum infestent angelos Caeli; per quod "recordatus sit Deus injustitiarum ejus," significatur quod Dominus Caelos ex violentia inde tutaturus sit. Quod haec significentur per illa verba, est quia omnia in Caelis sunt bona et vera, et omnia in Infernis sunt mala et falsa, et inde Caeli et Inferni prorsus separati sunt, et in situ inverso sicut antipodes: quare non possunt mala et falsa pertingere ad Caelos; sed tamen cum mala et falsa ultra gradus oppositionis, et inde justam mensuram, multiplicantur, infestantur Caeli, et nisi tunc Dominus tutatur Caelos, quod fit per influxum fortiorem a Se, violentia infertur Caelis; et cum hoc ad summum pervenit, tunc Ultimum Judicium facit, et sic liberantur. Inde est quod sequatur in hoc capite, "Exulta super ea Caelum, quia judicavit Deus judicium vestrum super ea," (vers. 20); et in sequente capite, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_761/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_19_1-9" target=_top>19:1-9</a>); et apud Jeremiam, <p>"Tunc canent super Babele Caeli et Terrae, et omne quod in illis, quando venient super illam vastatores," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_761/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_51_48" target=_top>51:48</a>). </p>
