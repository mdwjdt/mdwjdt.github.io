<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第29节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>29.“我是阿拉法，是俄梅戛，是始，是终”表那自有并且自初至终独一者，万物皆来自祂，因而表那为爱本身和独一的爱，智慧本身和独一智慧，生命本身和祂自己里面的独一生命，因而为创造者本身和独一创造者，救主和来自祂自己的启示者，因此为天堂和教会全部中的全部者。这些以及此外的更多事物就包含在描述主的这些话中。显而易见，它们论及主，事实上论及主的人性，因为接下来约翰听到有声音说：</p><p>我是阿拉法，是俄梅戛，是首先的，是末后的；他转过身来，要看那与祂说话的声音，就看见七灯台中间的人子。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.10.htm">1:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>稍后祂又说：</p><p>我是首先的，是末后的，我又是那存活的，曾死过。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.17.htm">1:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启2.8.htm">2:8</a>）</p><p>上述一切细节都包含在这些话中，这一点无法简单证明，因为要充分证明它们需要很长的篇幅；但它们仍在最近于阿姆斯特丹出版的《圣爱与圣智》一书得到部分证实。主自称“阿拉法和俄梅戛，始和终”，因为“阿拉法和俄梅戛”涉及主的神性之爱，“始和终”涉及祂的神性智慧。圣言的每一个细节里面都一个爱与智慧，或良善与真理的婚姻，关于这个主题，可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/80.htm">80</a>-90节）一书。</p><p>主之所以被称为“阿拉法和俄梅戛”，是因为在希腊字母表中，“阿拉法”是第一个字母，而“俄梅戛”是最后一个字母，故它们表示整体上的全部事物。原因在于，在灵界，字母表上的每个字母都表示某种事物；一个元音因用来发音，故表示情感或爱的某种事物。属灵和天使的语言，以及圣经皆源于此。不过，迄今为止，这依然是一个不为人知的奥秘。</p><p>因为所有天使和灵人有一种共通的语言，它与世人的任何语言毫无共同之处。每个人死后都能使用这种语言，因为它通过创造被植入在每个人里面，所以在整个灵界，他们都能懂得彼此。我经常被恩准听见这种语言，我自己也说，还把它与世间的语言进行对比，发现它与地上任何属世的语言都不相合，甚至在最小的细节上也不一致。它在第一个原则上就与这些不同，即每个字的每个字母，无论在说法上还是写法上，都有其特定的含义和意义。正因如此，主被称为“阿拉法和俄梅戛”，表示祂是天堂和教会全部中的全部；这两个字母都是元音，故与爱相关，如前所述。关于从天使的属灵思维所流出的这种语言及其写法，可参看《圣爱与圣智》<a href="../dlw/295.htm">295</a>节）一书。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 29</h4><p>29. "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End." (<a href="3927/revelation_1_8.htm">1:8</a>) This symbolically means, who is the one and only reality from firsts to lasts, from whom springs all else, thus who is the one and only love, the one and only wisdom, and the one and only life in itself, and so the one and only Creator, Savior and Enlightener from Himself, and therefore the all in all of the church and heaven.<p>These and still more are the ideas contained in these words, which describe the Lord. It is clearly apparent that they are said of the Lord, and indeed of His humanity, for we are told next that John heard a voice saying, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last," that he turned to see the voice that spoke with him, and that he saw the Son of Man in the midst of the seven lampstands (<a href="3927/revelation_1_10.htm">Revelation 1:10-13</a>) - who shortly also said, "I am the First and the Last, and am He who lives, and was put to death" (<a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">Revelation 1:17-18</a>, cf. <a href="3927/revelation_2_8.htm">2:8</a>).<p>As for all the particulars listed above, however, it is impossible to confirm these briefly, since to confirm them to people's comprehension would take many pages. Still, we have confirmed them in part in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Love and Wisdom, recently published in Amsterdam, q.v.<p>The Lord calls Himself the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, because Alpha and Omega have reference to His Divine love, while Beginning and End have reference to His Divine wisdom. For present in every particular of the Word is a marriage of love and wisdom or of goodness and truth, on which subject see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="../ss/80.htm">80-90</a>.</p><p>[2] The Lord is called the Alpha and the Omega because alpha and omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, and they consequently symbolize all things in their entirety. That is because in the spiritual world every alphabetic letter has some symbolic meaning, and a vowel, since it serves to provide tone, symbolizes something having to do with affection or love. From this origin springs spiritual and angelic speech, and also writing. But this is an arcanum previously unknown. For there is a universal language, which all angels and spirits possess, and it has nothing in common with any language of people in the world. Everyone comes into use of this language after death, as it is implanted in everyone from creation. Everyone can therefore understand everyone else throughout the whole spiritual world. I have been granted often to hear that language, and also to speak it, and I have compared it with languages in the world and found that it does not accord, even in the least particular, with any natural language on earth. It differs from them from its first characteristic, which is that every letter in each word has some symbolic meaning, both in speaking and in writing.<p>That, then, is why the Lord is called the Alpha and the Omega, which symbolically means that He is the all in all things of heaven and the church. And because they are both vowels, they have reference to love, as said above.<p>Regarding this language and the writing of it flowing from the spiritual thought of angels, see also some observations in Angelic Wisdom Regarding Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, no. <a href="../dlw/295.htm">295</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 29</h4><p>29. [verse 8] 'And I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the Ending' signifies Who is the Very and Only One from Primes to Ultimates, from Whom all things are; thus Who is the Very and One Only Love, the Very and One Only Wisdom, and the Very and One Only Life in Itself, and thus the Very and One Only Creator, Saviour, and Enlightener from Himself, and thence the All in all of heaven and the Church. These and more besides are the things that are contained in those words, by means of which the Lord is described. That they have been said concerning the Lord, and indeed concerning His Human, is quite plain, for it follows that [John]: heard a voice saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last; and he turned to see the voice that spoke with him, and he saw the Son of Man in the midst of the seven lampstand. <a href="3927/revelation_1_10.htm">Revelation 1:10-13</a>,<p>Who [i.e. the Son of Man] also soon after said:<p>I am the First and the Last, and am the Living One, and was put to deat. <a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">Revelation 1:17-18</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_2_8.htm">2:8</a>.<p>Moreover it is not possible in a few words to confirm that all the things that have been stated above are contained in those words, for to confirm them to the extent that they can be grasped (ad captum) would require many pages. They have, however, been confirmed in part in ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM recently published at Amsterdam, which may be seen. The Lord declares Himself to be 'Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the Ending,' because 'Alpha and Omega' have reference to His Divine Love, and 'the Beginning and the Ending' have reference to His Divine Wisdom; for there is a marriage of love and wisdom, or of good and truth, in the details (in singulis) of the Word, and concerning this marriage <a href="../ss/80.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 80-90</a> may be seen.</p><p>[2] The Lord is called 'Alpha and Omega' because Alpha is the first and Omega is the last character in the Greek alphabet, and consequently they signify all things inclusively. This is because any one letter of the alphabet in the spiritual world signifies some particular thing; and a vowel, since it is serviceable for sound, signifies something of affection or love. This is the origin of spiritual and angelic speech, and also writing. Up to this time, however, this arcanum has not been known; for there is a universal language in which all angels and spirits are, and this has nothing in common with any language of men in the world. Every man comes into this language after death, for each man has it implanted as a result of creation, and therefore in the entire spiritual world any one is able to understand another. It has often been granted me to hear that language, and to speak it also, and I have compared it with languages in the world, and found that there is no identity with any natural language on earth (in terris) even in the least thing. It differs from these by virtue of its first principle, which is that each letter of any word is the sign of some meaning both in speech and writing. Now, it is in consequence of this that the Lord is termed 'Alpha and Omega,' by which is signified that He is the All in all of heaven and the Church; and since these are two vowels, they have reference to love, as has been stated above. In <a href="../dlw/295.htm">ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM 295</a>, some things may be seen concerning this language and its writing flowing out of the spiritual thought of angels. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 29</h4><p>29. Verse 8. And I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, signifies Who is the Self-existing and the Only from firsts to ultimates, from Whom all things are; thus Who is Love Itself and the Only Love, Wisdom Itself and the Only Wisdom, Life Itself and the Only Life in Himself, and thus the Creator Himself and the Only Creator, Saviour and Enlightener from Himself, and thence the All in all of heaven and the church. These and many more things besides are contained in the above words, by which the Lord is described. That they are spoken of the Lord, and, indeed, of His Human, is very evident, for it follows that John heard a voice, saying:<p>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last; and He turned to see the voice that spake with him, and saw the Son of man in the midst of seven lampstands, (<a href="3927/revelation_1_10.htm">Revelation 1:10-13</a>).<p>Who, also, a little further on, says:<p>I am the First and the Last, I am He that liveth and was dead, (<a href="3927/revelation_1_17.htm">Revelation 1:17-18</a>, (<a href="3927/revelation_2_8.htm">2:8</a>)).<p>But that all the particulars above enumerated are contained in these words cannot be confirmed briefly, for to confirm them fully would require many sheets; still they are in part confirmed in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom, recently published in Amsterdam, which see. The Lord calls Himself "the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End," because "Alpha and Omega" refer to His Divine love, and "Beginning and End," to His Divine wisdom; for there is, in every particular of the Word, a marriage of love and wisdom, or of good and truth; on which subject, see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, (<a href="80.htm">80-90</a>).</p><p>[2] The Lord is called "the Alpha and the Omega," because Alpha is the first letter and Omega the last in the Greek Alphabet, and therefore they signify all in the aggregate. The reason is, that every letter of the alphabet, in the spiritual world, signifies something; and a vowel, because it is serviceable for sound, something of affection or love. From this origin, spiritual and angelic speech, and, also, the Scriptures, are derived; but this is an arcanum hitherto unknown. For there is a universal language in which all angels and spirits are; and this has nothing in common with any language of men in the world. Every man comes into this language after death; for it is implanted in every man from creation, therefore they all can understand each other in the whole spiritual world. It has been granted me frequently to hear that language, and also to speak it; and I have compared it with the languages in the world, and have found that it does not, even in the smallest particular, make one with any natural language on the earth. It differs from these in its first principle, which is, that each letter of every word has a sense and signification peculiar to itself, as well in speaking as in writing. Therefore it is that the Lord is called the Alpha and the Omega, which signifies that He is the All in all of heaven and the church; and as these two letters are vowels, they have relation to love, as was said above. Concerning this language, and the writing of it, flowing from the spiritual thought of the angels, something may be seen in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom, (<a href="295.htm">295</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 29 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>29. (Vere. 8.) "Et Ego sum Alpha et Omega, Principium et Finis," significat Qui est Ipsum et Unicum a Primis ad Ultima, ex Quo omnia; ita Qui est Ipse et Unicus Amor, Ipsa et Unica Sapientia, et Ipsa et Unica Vita in Se, et sic Ipse et Unicus Creator, Salvator et Illustrator a Se, et inde Omne in omnibus Caeli et Ecclesiae. -Haec sunt et plura adhuc, quae continentur in illis vocibus, per quas describitur Dominus; quod illa de Domino, et quidem de Humano Ipsius dicta sint, manifeste patet, nam sequitur, quod Audiverit vocem dicentem, Ego sum Alpha et Omega, Primus et Ultimus; et quod converterit se ad videndum vocem quae locuta est secum, et quod viderit Filium Hominis in medio septem candelabrorum, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_29/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_1_10-13" target=_top>1:10-13</a>);<p>Qui mox etiam dixit, <p>"Ego sum Primus et Ultimus, et Qui vivit, et fui mortuus," (vers. 17, 18; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_29/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_2_8" target=_top>2:8</a>).<p>Quod autem omnia illa, quae supra dicta sunt, contineantur in illis verbis, non potest paucis confirmari, nam confirmare illa ad captum, plurium membranarum opus foret; sed usque confirmata quoad partem sunt in Sapientia Angelica de Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia, nuper Amstelodami edita, quae videatur. Quod Dominus Se dicat "Alpham et Omegam, Principium et Finem," est quia "Alpha et Omega" se referunt ad Divinum Ipsius Amorem, ac "Principium et Finis" ad Divinam Ipsius Sapientiam; est enim in singulis Verbi conjugium amoris et Sapientiae, seu boni et veri, de quo videatur Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_29/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_80" target=_top>80-90</a>). Dominus vocatur "Alpha et Omega," quia Alpha est Prima et Omega est Ultima Syllaba in Alphabeto Graeco, et inde significant omnia in complexu; causa est, quia unaquaevis Litera Alphabetica in Mundo Spirituali significat aliquam rem, et Vocalis, quia inservit sono, aliquod affectionis seu amoris; ex hac origine est Loquela Spiritualis et Angelica, et quoque Scriptura; sed hoc est arcanum hactenus ignotum. Est enim Lingua Universalis, in qua sunt omnes Angeli et Spiritus, et haec nihil commune habet cum aliqua Lingua hominum in Mundo; in hanc Linguam venit omnis homo post mortem, est enim illa cuivis homini ex creatione insita, quare unusquisque alterum in universo Mundo Spirituali intelligere potest; datum est mihi saepius illam Linguam audire, tum illam loqui, et contuli illam cum Linguis in Mundo, et compertus sum quod ne quidem in aliquo minimo unum faciat cum aliqua Lingua naturali in terris; differt ab his ex primitivo suo, quod est, quod Unaquaevis litera cujusvis vocis significet aliquem sensum tam in loquela quam in scriptura. Inde nunc est, quod Dominus dicatur Alpha et Omega, per quod significatur quod sit Omne in omnibus Caeli et Ecclesiae; et quia sunt duo Vocales, se referunt ad Amorem, ut supra dictum est. De hac lingua et ejus Scriptura fluente ex spirituali cogitatione Angelorum, videantur etiam aliqua in Sapientia Angelica de Divino Amore et Divina Sapientia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_29/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_295" target=_top>295</a>). </p>
