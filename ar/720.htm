<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第720节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>720.启17:2.“地上的君王与她行淫”表它已经玷污了源自圣言的教会真理与良善。“行淫”表示歪曲和玷污真理，如前所述（<a href="719.htm">719</a>节）；“地上的君王”表示源自圣言的教会真理，“君王”表示源自良善的真理，“地”表示教会。“君王”或“王”表示那些处于源自主出于良善的真理之人，因而抽象来说，表示出于良善的真理（<a href="20.htm">20</a>，<a href="664.htm">664</a>节）在此表示那些被玷污和亵渎的真理。经上说“地上的君王”与大淫妇行淫，就好像“地上的君王”所表示的源自圣言的教会真理如此做；但这是照着字义上的圣言风格，从字义上看，诸如圣言的真理，以及出于人及其邪恶的事物都被归给了神和来自神的神性事物，如前面频繁所述。因此，真正的意义，也就是灵义，是指天主教玷污，甚至亵渎源自圣言的教会真理。凡不知道圣言灵义的人很容易误以为“地上的君王”是指地上的君王，而事实上不是指君王，而是指出于良善的真理，在反面意义上是指出于邪恶的虚假。</p><p>“地上的君王”无非表示教会的真理或虚假，“君王行淫”表示源自圣言的教会真理被歪曲、玷污和亵渎。为使这一点更清晰明了，有必要从启示录和但以理书引用一些经文，凡能认真思考的人，都能从中明白，其中的“王”不是指君王，这些经文是：</p><p>耶稣基督使我们作王和祭司。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.6.htm">1:6</a>）</p><p>又叫我们成为君王和祭司，归于神，我们要在地上掌权。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.10.htm">5:10</a>）</p><p>你们可以吃君王的肉，与将军的肉，马和骑马者的肉。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.18.htm">19:18</a>）</p><p>朱红色兽的七头就是七座山。又是七位王；五位已经倾倒，一位还在；那兽就是第八位王，和那七位同列。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.9.htm">17:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.11.htm">11</a>）</p><p>那十角，就是十王。他们还没有得国。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.12.htm">17:12</a>）</p><p>经上还说，如此处：</p><p>地上的君王与淫妇行淫，一同奢华的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.3.htm">18:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.9.htm">9</a>）</p><p>但凡能认真思考，谁看不出文此处“君王”不是指君王？同样，在但以理书： </p><p>“多毛的公山羊”就是希腊王，两眼之间的大角就是头一王；犯法的人罪恶满盈，有一王兴起，面貌凶恶，能用双关的诈语。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.21.htm">8:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.23.htm">23</a>）</p><p>这四个从海中上来的大兽就是四王，将要从地上兴起，第四个兽的十角就是十王，他们之后另有一位兴起，他必制伏三王。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.17.htm">7:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.24.htm">24</a>）</p><p>类似地：</p><p>南方王和北方王彼此争战；南方王差他的女儿去北方王那里；北方王自高自大，攻击神，承认外邦神；凡承认那神的人，他就以金银宝石和各样的宝物荣耀他们，使他们管辖许多人，分地为业给他们；他要在众海之间、荣美的圣山周围设立他会幕的帐棚；他到了结局等等。（但以理书11章）</p><p>“南方王”表示那些处于真理之人的王国或教会，“北方王”表示那些陷入虚假之人的王国或教会；这些话是对将要来的教会所作的预言，描述它们开始和后来的性质。那些处于源自主出于良善的真理之人之所以被称为“王”，是因为他们被称作“主的儿女”；他们被主重生，故被称为“从主生的”，以及“继承者”；因为主自己就是王，天堂与教会是祂的国度。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 720</h4><p>720. <a href="3927/revelation_17_2.htm">17:2</a> "With whom the kings of the earth committed whoredom." This symbolically means that the Roman Catholic religion adulterated the church's goods and truths that it had from the Word.<p>To commit whoredom means, symbolically, to falsify and adulterate truths, as said just above in no. <a href="719.htm">719</a>. The kings of the earth symbolize the church's truths that it has from the Word - kings symbolizing truths springing from goodness, and the earth symbolizing the church.<p>That kings symbolize people who possess truths springing from goodness from the Lord, and so in an abstract sense the truths themselves that spring from goodness, may be seen in nos. <a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="664.htm">664</a> above. Here they symbolize those truths adulterated and profaned.<p>We are told that the kings of the earth committed whoredom with the great harlot, as though the church's truths from the Word did so, truths being symbolized by the kings of the earth. But this accords with the style of the Word in its literal sense, in which we find attributed to God and to the Divine things emanating from Him - which include the Word's truths - qualities and actions which nevertheless are those of mankind and its evils, as has often been shown above. Consequently the genuine meaning - namely the spiritual sense - is that the Roman Catholic religion adulterated, indeed profaned, the church's truths which it had from the Word.<p>Someone who is unacquainted with the Word's spiritual meaning may easily be deluded into believing that the kings of the earth mean earthly kings, when in fact it is not those kings that are meant, but truths springing from goodness, and in an opposite sense, falsities springing from evil.</p><p>[2] To make it still more apparent that kings of the earth mean nothing else than a church's truths or falsities, and that kings' whoredoms are the falsifications, adulterations and profanations of the church's truths that is has from the Lord, we will cite several passages from the book of Revelation and Daniel, from which anyone capable of reflecting may see that it is not kings that are meant. The passages are these:<p>...Jesus Christ... has made us kings and priests... (<a href="3927/revelation_1_5.htm">Revelation 1:5-6</a>)<p>...you have made us kings and priests to our God, that we may reign on the earth. (<a href="3927/revelation_5_10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>)<p>...you (shall) eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains..., the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them... (<a href="3927/revelation_19_18.htm">Revelation 19:18</a>)<p>The seven heads (of the scarlet beast) are seven mountains... They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, and one is... And the beast... is... the eighth (king), and is of the seven... (<a href="3927/revelation_17_9.htm">Revelation 17:9-11</a>)<p>The ten horns... are ten kings that have not yet received a kingdom... (<a href="3927/revelation_17_12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a>)<p>We are also told later, as in the present verse, that the kings of the earth have committed whoredom with and taken delight in the harlot (<a href="3927/revelation_18_3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_18_9.htm">9</a>).<p>Who that is capable of reflecting does not see that kings here do not mean kings?</p><p>[3] Similar things are said in Daniel. For example, that the hairy male goat means a king, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king; and that when their transgressions have reached their height, a stern-faced king will arise who understands cunning schemes (<a href="3927/daniel_8_21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_8_23.htm">23</a>). That the four great beasts that arose out of the sea were four kings that would rise up from the earth, that the fourth beast's ten horns were ten kings, and that another would arise after them that would lay low the three kings (<a href="3927/daniel_7_17.htm">Daniel 7:17</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_24.htm">24</a>). So, too, that the king of the south and the king of the north would fight against each other; that the king of the south would send his daughter to the king of the north; that the king of the north would exalt himself against God, and would acknowledge a foreign god; that people who acknowledged that god he would honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and desirable things, and cause them to rule over many, and would divide the land for a price; that he would plant the tents of his tabernacle between the seas, in the vicinity of the glorious holy mountain; but that he would come to his end - besides much else (<a href="3927/daniel_11_1.htm">Daniel 11</a>).</p><p>[4] The king of the south symbolizes a kingdom or church consisting of people in possession of truths, and the king of the north symbolizes a kingdom or church consisting of people caught up in falsities. For the text is prophetic of churches to come, such as they would be in the beginning, and what they would be like after that.<p>People who possess truths springing from good from the Lord are called kings because they are called the Lord's children, and having been regenerated by the Lord, they are said to have been born of Him and to be His heirs, and the Lord is the King, and heaven and the church are His kingdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 720</h4><p>720. [verse 2] 'With whom the kings of the land have committed whoredom' signifies that they have adulterated the truths and goods of the Church that are derived from the Word. By 'to commit whoredom' is signified to falsify and adulterate truths, as just above (<a href="719.htm">719</a>). By 'the kings of the land' are signified the truths of the Church that are derived from the Word, by 'kings' truths derived from good, and by 'the land' the Church. That by 'kings' are signified those who are in truths derived from good out of the Lord, and therefore abstractly truths derived from good, may be seen above (<a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="644.htm">644</a>); here, those truths adulterated and profaned. It is said that 'the kings of the land have committed whoredom with the great harlot,' as though it were the truths of the Church that are derived from the Word which are signified by 'the kings of the land.' This, however, is in accordance with the style of the Word in the sense of the letter. In this there is ascribed to God and to Divine things from Himself the things that are truths of the Word, which yet are done by a man and his evils, as often above. Therefore the genuine sense, which is the spiritual sense, is that that form of religion has adulterated the truths of the Church that are derived from the Word, has in fact profaned them. He who does not know the spiritual sense of the Word can easily be misled, believing that by 'the kings of the land' are understood kings of the land, when yet not 'kings' but truths derived from good, and in the opposite sense untruths derived from evil, are understood.</p><p>[2] That it may be seen further that by 'the kings of the land' nothing else but the truths or untruths of the Church are understood and by their 'whoredoms' the truths of the Church that are derived from the Word, falsified, adulterated and profaned, some passages out of the Apocalypse and Daniel shall be quoted, whereby every one who is capable of reflection can see that kings are not understood. These are:<p>Jesus Christ has made us kings and priests. <a href="3927/revelation_1_6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>.<p>Thou hast made us to our God kings and priests that we may reign over the land. <a href="3927/revelation_5_10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>.<p>You shall eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of horses and of those sitting upon them. <a href="3927/revelation_19_18.htm">Revelation 19:18</a>.<p>The seven heads of the scarlet beast are seven mountains, and they are seven kings; five have fallen, and one is; and the beast is the eighth king, and is of the seven. <a href="3927/revelation_17_9.htm">Revelation 17:9-11</a>.<p>The ten horns are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom. <a href="3927/revelation_17_12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a>.<p>It is also said as here, that:<p>The kings of the land have committed whoredom and lived luxuriously with the harlot. <a href="3927/revelation_18_3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_18_9.htm">9</a>.<p>Who that is able to reflect does not see that by 'kings' here kings are not understood?</p><p>[3] In like manner in Daniel, as:<p>That by the rough goat is understood the king, and by the great horn between his eyes the first king; and when the transgressions were come to the full, a king hard of face and understanding subtle things should rise up. <a href="3927/daniel_8_21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_8_23.htm">23</a>.<p>That the four beasts coming up out of the sea were four kings, who shall rise up from the land, and that the ten horns of the fourth beast were ten kings, and that another should arise after them, who shall humble the three kings. <a href="3927/daniel_7_17.htm">Daniel 7:17</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_24.htm">24</a>.<p>In like manner that the king of the south and the king of the north should fight each other; and that the king of the south should send his daughter to the king of the north, and that this king should exalt himself against God, and that he should not acknowledge a strange god; and that he should honour with gold, silver, a precious stone, and desirable things those who acknowledge that god, and should cause them to have dominion over many, and should divide the land for a price; and that he should plant the tent of his tabernacle amid the seas, around the mountain of the ornament of holiness, but that he is going to come to his end; besides many other things, <a href="3927/daniel_11_1.htm">Daniel 11</a> to the end.</p><p>[4] By 'the king of the south' is signified a kingdom or Church from those who are in truths, and by 'the king of the north' is signified a kingdom or Church from those who are in untruths, for it is a prophetic utterance concerning Churches to come, what they are going to be like in the beginning, and what at the end. The reason why those who are in truths derived from good from the Lord are termed 'kings' is because they are called the Lord's 'sons;' and because they have been regenerated by Him they are called 'born from Him' and also 'heirs'; and because the Lord is the King Himself, while heaven and the Church are His kingdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 720</h4><p>720. Verse 2. With whom the kings of the earth have committed whoredom, signifies that it has adulterated the truths and goods of the church which are from the Word. "To commit whoredom" signifies to falsify and adulterate truths, as above, (<a href="719.htm">719</a>); by "the kings of the earth" are signified the truths of the church which are from the Word, by "kings," truths from good, and by "earth," the church. That by "kings" are signified those who are in truths from good from the Lord, and thence abstractly the truths from good, may be seen above, (<a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="664.htm">664</a>); here those truths adulterated and profaned. It is said that "the kings of the earth" committed whoredom with the great harlot, as though the truths of the church which are from the Word, which are signified by "the kings of the earth," had so done; but this is according to the style of the Word in the sense of the letter, in which are ascribed to God and to the Divine things which are from Him, such as are the truths of the Word, the things which come nevertheless from man and his evils, as has been frequently observed above. Therefore the genuine sense, which is the spiritual sense, is that that religious persuasion adulterated, yea, profaned the truths of the church which are from the Word. He who does not know the spiritual sense of the Word may easily be misled by believing that by "the kings of the earth" are meant kings of the earth, when yet kings are not meant, but truths from good, and in the opposite sense, falsities from evil.</p><p>[2] To render it more fully evident that by "the kings of the earth" nothing else but the truths or falsities of the church are meant, and by "their whoredoms," the truths of the church, which are from the Word, falsified, adulterated, and profaned, some passages shall be adduced from Revelation and from Daniel, from which anyone capable of reflection may see that kings are not meant, which are:<p>Jesus Christ hath made us kings and priests, (<a href="3927/revelation_1_6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>).<p>And hast made us unto our God kings and priests; and we shall reign over the earth, (<a href="3927/revelation_5_10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>).<p>That ye may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them, (<a href="3927/revelation_19_18.htm">Revelation 19:18</a>).<p>The seven heads of the scarlet beast are seven mountains.

In like manner that by "the rough goat" is meant the king of Grecia, in Daniel:<p>And the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king; and when transgressors are come to the full, a king, hard of face and understanding subtle things, shall rise up, (<a href="3927/daniel_8_21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_8_23.htm">23</a>).<p>That the four beasts coming out of the sea were four kings who shall arise from the earth and that the ten horns of the fourth beast were ten kings, and that another should rise after them who should humble the three kings, (<a href="3927/daniel_7_17.htm">Daniel 7:17</a>, <a href="3927/daniel_7_24.htm">24</a>).<p>In like manner, that the king of the south and the king of the north should fight with each other; and that the king of the south should send his daughter to the king of the north; and that this king should exalt himself against God, and acknowledge a strange god; and that he should honor with gold and silver, and with precious stones, and desirable things, those who acknowledged that god, and should cause them to have dominion over many, and divide the land for a price; and that he should plant the tent of his tabernacle between the seas, around the mountain of the ornament of holiness; but that he should come to his end; with much more to the same purpose, (<a href="3927/daniel_11_1.htm">Daniel 11:1</a>).</p><p>[4] By "the king of the south" is signified the kingdom or church of those who are in truths, and by "the king of the north" is signified the kingdom and church of those who are in falsities; for it is a prophecy concerning the churches to come, showing their quality in the beginning, and afterwards. The reason why they who are in truths from good from the Lord are called "kings," is because they are called "the sons" of the Lord; and because they are regenerated by Him, they are called "born from Him," and also "heirs;" and because the Lord is Himself a king, and heaven and the church are his kingdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 720 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>720. (Vers. 2.)

Similiter apud Danielem, ut quod Per "hircum hirsutum" intelligatur "Rex," et per "cornu ejus magnum inter oculos Rex primus ; et cum ad summum venirent praevaricationes, exsurgeret Rex durus faciebus ac intelligens subtilia, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_720/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_8_21" target=_top>Daniel 8:21</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_720/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_8_23" target=_top>23</a>);<p>Quod quatuor Bestiae ascendentes ex mari, "essent quatuor Reges qui surgent de terra;" et quod decem cornua Bestiae quartae "decem Reges essent," et quod "alius surgeret post eos, qui tres Reges humiliabit," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_720/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_7_17" target=_top>Daniel 7:17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_720/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_7_24" target=_top>24</a>);<p>Pariter quod Rex meridiei et Rex septentrionis pugnarent inter se; et quod Rex meridiei mitteret filiam suam ad Regem septentrionis; et quod hic Rex exaltaret se contra Deum, et quod deum alienum agnosceret: et quod illos, qui agnituri illum deum, honoraret auro, argento, lapide pretioso et desiderabilibus, et illos dominari faceret in multos, et terram divideret pretio: et quod plantaret tentoria tabernaculi sui inter maria, circa montem decoris sanctitatis; sed quod venturus sit ad finem suum; praeter plura alia, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_720/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_daniel_11_1-45" target=_top>Daniel 11</a>); per "Regem meridiei" significatur Regnum seu Ecclesia ab illis qui in veris sunt, et per "Regem septentrionis" significatur Regnum et Ecclesia ab illis qui in falsis sunt; est enim propheticum de Ecclesiis venturis, quales futurae in principio, et quales postea. Causa quod qui in veris ex bono a Domino sunt, dicantur "reges," est quia vocantur "filii" Domini; et quia regenerati sunt ab Ipso, vocantur "nati ab Ipso," et quoque "haeredes;" et quia Dominus est Ipse Rex, ac Caelum et Ecclesia sunt Regnum Ipsius. </p>
