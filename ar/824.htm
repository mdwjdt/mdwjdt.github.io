<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第824节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>824.“又有写着的名字，除了祂自己没有人知道”表除了主和祂自己所揭示给的人外，没有人明白圣言在其属灵和属天意义上的性质。“名字”表示某人的性质（<a href="165.htm">165</a>节等），在此表示圣言的性质，或圣言的内在性质，也就是在其属灵和属天意义上的性质。经上之所以说“写着的名字”，是因为圣言既存在于地上的世人当中，也存在于天上的天使当中；对此，可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/70.htm">70</a>-75节）。“除了祂自己没有人知道”表示除了主自己和祂所揭示给的人外，没有人明白圣言在属灵意义上的性质。除了主，没有人明白圣言的灵义，因而若非通过主，没有人明白灵义，并且若非处于来自主自己的神性真理，没有人能通过主明白这灵义；对此，可参看《新耶路撒冷教义之圣经篇》（<a href="../ss/26.htm">26</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 824</h4><p>824. He had a name written that no one knew but Himself. This symbolically means that what the Word is like in its spiritual and celestial senses, no one sees but the Lord, and the person to whom He reveals it.<p>A name symbolizes someone's character (no. <a href="165.htm">165</a> and elsewhere), here the character of the Word, or what the Word is like inwardly, that is, in its spiritual and celestial senses. It is said to be a name written, because the Word exists both among people on earth and among angels in heaven (see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture, nos. <a href="../ss/70.htm">70-75</a>.). No one's knowing the name but Himself means, symbolically, that no one but the Lord Himself sees it, that is, what the Word is like in its spiritual sense, and the person to whom He reveals it.<p>That no one sees the Word's spiritual meaning but the Lord alone, that no one accordingly sees that meaning unless enabled to do so by the Lord, and that no one is enabled to do so by the Lord unless he possesses Divine truths from the Lord, may be seen in <a href="../ss/26.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Sacred Scripture 26</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 824</h4><p>824. 'Having a Name written that no one knew but Himself' signifies that no one sees what the Word is like in its spiritual and celestial sense but the Lord and he to whom He Himself reveals it. By 'a name' is signified the quality of anyone (<a href="165.htm">165</a> and elsewhere), here the quality of the Word or what the Word is like within, that is, in its spiritual and celestial sense. It is said 'a Name 'written' because the Word exists both with men on earth and with angels in the heavens; see <a href="../ss/70.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 70-75</a>. By 'that no one knew but Himself' is signified that no one sees but the Lord Himself and he to whom He Himself reveals it, that is, what the Word is like in the spiritual sense. That no one but the Only Lord sees the spiritual sense of the Word, and consequently that no one sees that sense except from the Lord, and that no one [does this] from the Lord unless he is in Divine truths from Himself, may be seen in <a href="../ss/26.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE SACRED SCRIPTURE 26</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 824</h4><p>824. Having a name written which no one knew but Himself, signifies that no one sees of what quality the Word is in its spiritual and celestial senses but the Lord, and he to whom He reveals it. By "a name" is signified the quality of anyone, (<a href="165.htm">165</a>, and elsewhere); here the quality of the Word, or what the Word is within, that is, in its spiritual and celestial senses. It is said, "a name written," because the Word is both with men on earth and with the angels in the heavens; see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, (<a href="70.htm">70-75</a>). By "no one knew but Himself," is signified that no one sees but the Lord Himself, and he to whom He reveals it, that is, what the quality of the Word is in the spiritual sense. That no one sees the spiritual sense of the Word but the Lord alone, and hence that no one sees that sense except from the Lord, and no one from the Lord unless he is in Divine truths from Him, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture, (<a href="26.htm">26</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 824 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>824. "Habens Nomen scriptum, quod nemo novit nisi Ipse," significat quod quale est Verbum in Sensu spirituali et caelesti ejus, nemo videat quam Dominus, et cui Ipse revelat. - Per "nomen" significatur quale alicujus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_824/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_165" target=_top>165</a>, et alibi); hic, quale Verbi, seu quale Verbum est intus, hoc est, in Sensu spirituali et caelesti ejus: dicitur "Nomen scriptum," quia Verbum est tam apud homines in terris, quam apud angelos in Caelis (videatur Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_824/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_70" target=_top>70-75</a>). Per quod "nemo novit nisi Ipse" significatur quod nemo videat quam Ipse Dominus, et cui Ipse revelat, hoc est, quale est Verbum in Sensu spirituali. Quod nemo videat Sensum spiritualem Verbi quam Solus Dominus, et inde quod nemo videat illum Sensum nisi a Domino, et quod nemo a Domino nisi in Divinis veris ab Ipso sit, videatur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_824/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-scriptura-sacra_26" target=_top>Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Scriptura Sacra 26</a>. </p>
