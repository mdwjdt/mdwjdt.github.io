<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第189节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>189.“免得人夺去你的冠冕”表免得智慧消亡，永恒福乐就出自智慧。人的智慧从主来自藉由真理的良善，并非来自其它源头。人之所以通过这些拥有智慧，是因为主与人并人与主的结合是藉着它们，主是智慧本身。因此，当人不再践行真理，也就是不照真理生活时，他所具有的智慧就会消亡，因为这时，他不再热爱智慧，从而不再爱主。“智慧”是指属灵事物上的智慧。其它事物上的智慧源出于此，如同来自一个源泉。其它事物上的智慧就是所谓的聪明，而知识又经由聪明而来，通过认识真理的情感而存在。“冠冕”表示智慧，因为对人而言，智慧占据至高无上的地位，因而给他戴上冠冕。“王冠”并非表别的，因为“王”在灵义上是指神性真理（<a href="20.htm">20</a>节），一切智慧皆来自神性真理。</p><p>在以下经文中，“冠冕”也表智慧：</p><p>我要叫大卫的角在那里发生，但他的冠冕要在头上发光。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗132.17.htm">132:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗132.18.htm">18</a>）</p><p>耶和华将耳环戴在你耳朵上，将华冠戴在你头上。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.12.htm">16:12</a>）</p><p>这是说耶路撒冷，“耶路撒冷”表教会的教义，故“华冠”就是出于神性真理或圣言的智慧。</p><p>到那日，万军之耶和华必作祂余剩之民的荣冠华冕。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.5.htm">28:5</a>）</p><p>这些话论及主，因为经上说“到那日”；祂所是的“荣冠”是指智慧，“华冕”是指聪明；“余剩之民”是指与主的教会同在的人。</p><p>这些经文中的“华冠”和“冕旒”，以及“亚伦冠冕上的金牌”，也就是所谓的“花冠”（coronet）所表相同，即以赛亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.1.htm">62:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.3.htm">3</a>），出埃及记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.36.htm">28:36</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.37.htm">37</a>）。以下经文中的也一样：</p><p>你要对国王和王后说，要自己谦卑，坐在下边。因你们的头巾，就是你们的华冠，已经脱落了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.18.htm">13:18</a>）</p><p>我们心中的快乐止息，我们头上的冠冕掉下来。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀5.15.htm">5:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀5.16.htm">16</a>）</p><p>他剥去我的荣光，摘去我头上的冠冕。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯19.9.htm">19:9</a>）</p><p>你将所膏的冠冕丢在地上。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.39.htm">89:39</a>）</p><p>在这些经文中，“冠冕”皆表智慧。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 189</h4><p>189. "'That no one may take your crown.'" This symbolically means, lest they lose the wisdom from which comes eternal happiness.<p>A person acquires wisdom from no other source than goodness gained through truths from the Lord. A person acquires wisdom through these truths because they are the means by which the Lord conjoins Himself with the person and the person with Himself, and the Lord is wisdom itself. Wisdom consequently perishes in a person when he stops putting truths into practice, that is, when he stops living in accordance with them. He also then ceases to love wisdom, and accordingly ceases to love the Lord.<p>By wisdom we mean wisdom in spiritual matters. From this as a wellspring flows wisdom in all else, which we call intelligence, and through this knowledge, which results from an affection for knowing truths.<p>A crown symbolizes wisdom, because wisdom occupies the highest place in a person and so crowns him. Nor is anything else symbolized by the crown of a king, for a king in the Word's spiritual sense is Divine truth (no. <a href="20.htm">20</a>), and from Divine truth comes all wisdom.</p><p>[2] Wisdom is symbolically meant by a crown also in the following passages:<p>...I will make the horn of David grow..., and upon Him His crown shall flourish. (<a href="3927/psalms_132_17.htm">Psalms 132:17-18</a>)<p>(Jehovah) put... earrings in your ears, and an ornate crown on your head. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_16_12.htm">Ezekiel 16:12</a>)<p>This is said of Jerusalem, which symbolizes the church in respect to doctrine, and therefore the ornate crown is wisdom originating from Divine truth or the Word.<p>In that day Jehovah of Hosts will be for an ornate crown and a beautiful turban to the remnants of His people. (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_5.htm">Isaiah 28:5</a>)<p>This is said of the Lord, because it says "in that day." The ornate crown for which He will be is wisdom, and the beautiful turban is intelligence. The remnants of the people are people among whom the church will be.</p><p>[3] The crown and turban in <a href="3927/isaiah_62_1.htm">Isaiah 62:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_62_3.htm">3</a> have the same symbolic meaning. So, too, does the plate upon the turban of Aaron in <a href="3927/exodus_28_36.htm">Exodus 28:36-37</a>, which is also called a miter.<p>Furthermore, in the following:<p>Say to the king and his lady, "Lower yourselves, sit down, for the ornament of your head has come down, the crown of your beauty." (<a href="3927/jeremiah_13_18.htm">Jeremiah 13:18</a>)<p>The joy of our heart has ceased... The crown has fallen from our head. (<a href="3927/lamentations_5_15.htm">Lamentations 5:15-16</a>)<p>He has stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. (<a href="3927/job_19_9.htm">Job 19:9</a>)<p>You have profaned [by casting it] to the ground the crown (of Your anointed). (<a href="3927/psalms_89_39.htm">Psalms 89:39</a>)<p>The crown in these places symbolizes wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 189</h4><p>189. 'That no one may get thy crown' signifies lest the wisdom, out of which eternal happiness [comes], should perish. A man's wisdom is from no other source than out of good by means of truths from the Lord. It is because the Lord conjoins Himself with the man and the man with Himself by means of these, that through them the man has wisdom, and the Lord is Wisdom Itself. On account of this, wisdom perishes with a man when he ceases to do truths, that is, to live in accordance with them. In that event he also ceases to love wisdom, and hence the Lord. By 'wisdom' is understood wisdom in things spiritual. Out of this as a fountain is derived wisdom in the other things, which is called intelligence, and through intelligence knowledge, which exists out of the affection of knowing truths. It is because wisdom holds the supreme place with a man, and so crowns him, that a 'crown' signifies wisdom. Nothing else is signified by a king's crown, for a 'king' in the spiritual sense is Divine Truth (<a href="20.htm">20</a>), and all wisdom exists out of Divine Truth.</p><p>[2] Wisdom is signified by 'crown' in the following places also:<p>I will make the horn of David to bud, and upon it shall his crown flourish. <a href="3927/psalms_132_17.htm">Psalms 132:17-18</a>.<p>Jehovah has put earrings upon thine ears, and a crown of decoration upon thine head. <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_12.htm">Ezekiel 16:12</a>.<p>This [is said] of Jerusalem, by which the Church as to doctrine is signified, and therefore a 'crown of decoration' is wisdom out of Divine Truth or the Word.<p>In that day shall Jehovah Zebaoth be for a croon of decoration, and for a mitre of beauty unto the residue of His people. <a href="3927/isaiah_28_5.htm">Isaiah 28:5</a>.<p>This [is said] of the Lord, because 'in that day' is said. The crown of decoration 'for which He will be' is wisdom, and the 'mitre of beauty' is intelligence. The 'residue of the people' are they with whom His Church will be.</p><p>[3] The like is signified by 'crown' and 'mitre' (<a href="3927/isaiah_62_1.htm">Isaiah 62:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_62_3.htm">3</a>); also by the 'plate of gold' upon Aaron's mitre (<a href="3927/exodus_28_36.htm">Exodus 28:36-37</a>), which was also called a 'coronet.' Again in these:<p>Say unto the king and to [his] lady, Lower yourselves, sit down, for the decoration of your head is come down, the crown of your beauty. <a href="3927/jeremiah_13_18.htm">Jeremiah 13:18</a>.<p>The joy of our heart is ceased, the crown is fallen from our head, <a href="3927/lamentations_5_15.htm">Lamentations 5:15-16</a>.<p>He has stripped me of my glory, and taken away the crown from my head, <a href="3927/job_19_9.htm">Job 19:9</a>.<p>Thou hast cast the crown of Thine Anointed to the earth. <a href="3927/psalms_89_39.htm">Psalms 89:39</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_89_40.htm">40</a>].<p>In these places by 'crown' is signified wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 189</h4><p>189. That no one take thy crown, signifies lest wisdom should perish, from which comes eternal happiness. Wisdom in man is from no other source than good by truths from the Lord. The reason why man has wisdom through these, is, because the Lord conjoins Himself to man, and man to Himself by them, and the Lord is wisdom itself; therefore wisdom perishes with man when he ceases to do truths, that is, to live according to them, for then he ceases to love wisdom, and thus the Lord. By wisdom is meant wisdom in things spiritual, from which, as from a fountain, is derived wisdom in other things, which is called intelligence, and by intelligence, science, which exists from the affection of knowing truths. "A crown" signifies wisdom, because wisdom holds the supreme place with man, and thus crowns him. Nor does "a king's crown" signify anything else, for "king," in the spiritual sense, is the Divine truth, (<a href="20.htm">20</a>), and from the Divine truth is all wisdom.</p><p>[2] Wisdom is also signified by "crown" in the following places:<p>There will I make the horn of David to bud, but upon himself shall his crown flourish, (<a href="3927/psalms_132_17.htm">Psalms 132:17-18</a>).<p>Jehovah gave ear-rings upon thine ears, and a crown of ornament upon thy head, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_16_12.htm">Ezekiel 16:12</a>).<p>Speaking of Jerusalem, by which is signified the church as to doctrine, therefore "a crown of ornament" is wisdom from the Divine truth or the Word.<p>In that day shall Jehovah of Hosts be for a crown of ornament and for a miter of beauty unto the residue of His people, (<a href="3927/isaiah_28_5.htm">Isaiah 28:5</a>).<p>These things are concerning the Lord, because it is said "in that day;" "the crown of ornament" which He will be, is wisdom, and "the miter of beauty" is intelligence; "the residue of the people" are they with whom His church will be.</p><p>[3] The same is signified by "crown" and "miter" in <a href="3927/isaiah_62_1.htm">Isaiah 62:1</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_62_3.htm">3</a>; as also by "the plate upon Aaron's miter" (<a href="3927/exodus_28_36.htm">Exodus 28:36-37</a>), which was also called "the coronet." Likewise in these places:<p>Say unto the king, and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down, for the ornament of your head is come down, the crown of your comeliness, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_13_18.htm">Jeremiah 13:18</a>).<p>The joy of our heart is ceased, the crown of our head is fallen, (<a href="3927/lamentations_5_15.htm">Lamentations 5:15-16</a>).<p>He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown of my head, (<a href="3927/job_19_9.htm">Job 19:9</a>).<p>Thou hast condemned the crown of Thine anointed to the earth, (<a href="3927/psalms_89_39.htm">Psalms 89:39</a>).<p>In these places, by "crown" is signified wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 189 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>189. "Ut nemo accipiat coronam tuam," significat ne pereat sapientia, ex qua felicitas aeterna. Sapientia homini non aliunde est quam ex bono per vera a Domino; quod per haec sit homini sapientia, est quia Dominus conjungit Se Domini et hominem Sibi per illa, et Dominus est Ipsa Sapientia; quare sapientia apud hominem perit, quando ille desinit facere vera, hoc est vivere secundum illa; tunc etiam desinit amare sapientiam, proinde Dominum. Per sapientiam intelligitur sapientia in spiritualibus; ex hac ut fonte derivatur sapientia in reliquis, quae vocatur intelligentia; et per hanc, scientia quae est ex affectione sciendi vera. Quod "corona" significet sapientiam, est quia sapientia supremum locum tenet apud hominem, et sic coronat illum; nec aliud significat "Corona Regis," nam "Rex" in spirituali Sensu est Divinum Verum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_189/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_20" target=_top>20</a>), et ex Divino Vero est omnis sapientia. Sapientia per "coronam" etiam significatur in sequentibus locis: <p>"Germinare faciam cornu Davidi, et super illo florebit Corona ejus," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_189/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_132_17-18" target=_top>Psalm 132:17-18</a>);<p>Jehovah dedit "inaures super aures tuas, et Coronam ornatus super caput tuum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_189/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_16_12" target=_top>Ezechiel 16:12</a>);<p>haec de Hierosolyma, per quam significatur Ecclesia quoad doctrinam; quare "Corona ornatus" est sapientia ex Divino Vero seu Verbo: <p>"In die illo erit Jehovah Zebaoth in Coronam ornatus, et in Cidarim decoris reliquiis populi Sui," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_189/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_28_5" target=_top>Esaias 28:5</a>);<p>haec de Domino, quia dicitur "in die illo;" "Corona ornatus" in quam erit, est sapientia, et "Cidaris decoris" est intelligentia "reliquiae populi" sunt apud quos Ipsius Ecclesia erit. <p>Simile per "Coronam" et "Cidarim" significatur, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_189/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_62_1" target=_top>Esaias 62:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_189/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_62_3" target=_top>3</a>);<p>Tum simile per "Bracteam super Cidari Aharonis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_189/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_exodus_28_36-37" target=_top>Exodus 28:36-37</a>), quae etiam vocabatur "Coronamentum." <p>Insuper in his: <p>"Dic Regi et Dominae, Dimittite vos, sedete, quia descendit ornamentum capitis vestri, Corona decoris vestri," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_189/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_13_18" target=_top>Jeremias 13:18</a>) <p>"Cessavit gaudium cordis nostri, cecidit Corona capitis nostri," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_189/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_lamentations_5_15-16" target=_top>Threni 5:15-16</a>). <sup>1</sup><p>"Gloriam a me abstraxit, et removit Coronam capitis mei," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_189/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_job_19_9" target=_top>Hiob 19:9</a>);<p>"Damnasti in terram Coronam Uncti Tui," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_189/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_89_40" target=_top>Psalm 89:40</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_189/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_89_39" target=_top>39</a>);<p>in his locis per "Coronam" significatur sapientia.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;15, 16 pro "16, 17" </p>
