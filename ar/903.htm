<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第903节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>903.“根基上有羔羊十二使徒的名字”表来自圣言关于主和照其诫命生活的教义的全部事物。根基上之所以写有“羔羊十二使徒的名字”，是因为“十二使徒”表示主教会的全部事物（<a href="79.htm">79</a>，<a href="233.htm">233</a>，<a href="790.htm">790</a>节），在此表示教会教义的全部事物，因为他们的名字写在“十二根基”上，而“十二根基”表示新耶路撒冷教义的全部事物（<a href="902.htm">902</a>节）；“十二个名字”表示其全部性质，其全部性质皆关系到教义、因而该教会中的两大要素，即：主与照其诫命的生活，故所表示的是这些。</p><p>新耶路撒冷教义的全部事物之所以都关系到这两大要素，是因为这两大要素是教义的共性，一切细节皆依赖于它们，并且它们也是本质，其一切形式的事物皆从这本质发出；所以，它们如同其教义全部事物的灵魂和生命。诚然，它们为二，但彼此却无法分开，因为将它们分开就如同把主与人，并人与主分开，这种情况下是不会有教会的。这两大要素就像律法的两块石版那样相结合，其中一块石版包含涉及主的内容，另一块则包含涉及人的内容，所以它们被称为约，约表示结合。试想一下，若只留第一块，扔掉第二块，或只留第二块，扔掉第一块，那么律法的这两块石版会成什么样子呢？岂不就像神不看人，或人不看神，一个逐渐远离另一个吗？说明这些事，是为了叫人知道，新耶路撒冷教义的全部事物都关系到对主之爱和对邻之爱。对主之爱就是拥有对主之信，遵行祂的诫命，遵行祂的诫命就是对邻之爱，因为遵行祂的诫命就是向邻致用。遵行祂诫命的人是爱主的人，这是主自己在约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.21.htm">14:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.24.htm">24</a>）中的教导；对神之爱和对邻之爱就是一切律法和先知所依赖的两条诫命，即它们的总纲（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.35.htm">22:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.38.htm">38</a>）；“律法和先知”表示整体上的圣言。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 903</h4><p>903. And on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. This symbolizes all of the doctrines from the Word regarding the Lord and living in accordance with His commandments.<p>The foundations had the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb written on them because the twelve apostles symbolize the Lord's church and everything connected with it (nos. <a href="79.htm">79</a>, <a href="233.htm">233</a>, <a href="790.htm">790</a>), in this case the church in respect to all of its doctrines, because their names were written on the twelve foundations, which symbolize all of the doctrines of the New Jerusalem (no. <a href="902.htm">902</a>). The twelve names symbolize its whole character, and its whole character has to do with two elements in the doctrine and so in that church: the Lord and living in accordance with His commandments. Therefore these are what are symbolized.<p>All of the doctrines of the New Jerusalem relate to these two elements, because they are its universal tenets on which all of its particular ones depend, and they are the essential elements from which all of its outward expressions originate. Therefore they are, as it were, the soul and life in all of its doctrines.<p>They are, indeed, two elements, but one cannot be divorced from the other. For to divorce them would be like divorcing the Lord from mankind, or mankind from the Lord, and in that case there would be no church.<p>These two elements are joined together like the two tables of the Ten Commandments, one of which contains commandments having to do with the Lord, and the other commandments having to do with people. There they are called a covenant, and a covenant symbolizes conjunction.<p>Think what the case would be with the tables of the Ten Commandments if only the first were to remain and the second were to be snatched away. Or if the second were to remain and the first were to be snatched away. Would it not be as though God did not see mankind, or as though mankind did not see God? Or as though one abandoned the other?<p>We say this to make it known that everything connected with the doctrine of the New Jerusalem relates to love toward the Lord and love for the neighbor. To love the Lord is to have faith in the Lord and obey His commandments, and to obey His commandments is to love the neighbor, since to obey the Lord's commandments is to be of useful service to the neighbor. People who love the Lord are those who obey His commandments, as the Lord Himself teaches in <a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>. And love toward the Lord and love for the neighbor are the two commandments on which hang the Law and the Prophets (<a href="3927/matthew_22_37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>). The Law and the Prophets mean the Word in its entirety. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 903</h4><p>903. 'And in them the names of the Lamb's twelve apostles' signifies all the things of the doctrine derived from the Word concerning the Lord and concerning a life in accordance with His precepts. The reason why 'the names of the Lamb's twelve apostles' were written in the foundations is because by 'the twelve apostles' is signified the Lord's Church as to all the things thereof (<a href="79.htm">79</a>, <a href="233.htm">233</a>, <a href="790.htm">790</a>), here as to all the things of its doctrine, because their names 'were written upon the twelve foundations,' by which are signified all the things of the doctrine of the New Jerusalem (<a href="902.htm">902</a>). By 'the twelve names' is signified every quality thereof, and every quality of it has reference to two things in the doctrine and in the Church therefrom, concerning the Lord and concerning a life in accordance with His precepts. Therefore these are signified. The reason why all the things of the doctrine of the New Jerusalem have reference to these two is because they are its universals upon which all the details (singularia) depend, and they are the essentials out of which all the formal things proceed, consequently they are as the soul and life of all its doctrine. There are indeed the two, but the one cannot be separated from the other, for to separate them would be like separating the Lord from man and man from the Lord, and then the Church would not exist. These two have been conjoined like the two tables of the Law, of which the one contains the things that are the Lord's and the other those that are man's. They are therefore called a covenant and a 'covenant' signifies conjunction. Think what would be the case with these tables of the Law if the first only remained and the second were torn away. Would it not be as if God were not seeing man or as if man were not seeing God, and as if the one were receding from the other. These things have been said so that it may be known that all the things of the doctrine of the New Jerusalem are related to love directed to the Lord and to love towards the neighbour. Love directed to the Lord is to have faith in the Lord and do His precepts, and to do His precepts is love towards the neighbour, since to do His precepts is to do uses to the neighbour. That those love the Lord who do His precepts, the Lord Himself teaches in <a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>; also that love directed to the Lord and love towards the neighbour are the two precepts upon which the Law and the Prophets depend (<a href="3927/matthew_22_37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a> [Schm. <a href="3927/matthew_22_35.htm">35-38</a>]). By 'the Law and the Prophets' is understood the Word as a complete whole. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 903</h4><p>903. And in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, signifies all things of doctrine from the Word concerning the Lord and concerning a life according to His commandments. The reason why in the foundations were written "the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb" is because by "the twelve apostles" is signified the Lord's church as to all things of it, (<a href="79.htm">79</a>, <a href="233.htm">233</a>, <a href="790.htm">790</a>), here as to all things of its doctrine, because their names were written over "the twelve foundations" by which are signified all things of the doctrine of the New Jerusalem, (<a href="902.htm">902</a>); by "twelve names" are signified all its quality, and all its quality has relation to two things in doctrine, and thence in that church, concerning the Lord and concerning life according to His commandments, therefore these are signified. The reason why all things of the doctrine of the New Jerusalem have relation to these two things is because they are its universals, on which all the particulars depend, and they are the essentials from which all its formal things proceed; they are therefore as the soul and life of all things of its doctrine. They are indeed two, but one cannot be separated from the other, for to separate them would be like separating the Lord from man, and man from the Lord, in which case there is no church. These two things are conjoined like the two tables of the Law, one of which contains what relates to the Lord and the other what relates to man, wherefore they are called a covenant, and a covenant signifies conjunction. Think what would become of those tables of the Law, if the first only was to remain, and the second to be torn away, or if the second was to remain, and the first to be torn away. Would it not be as if God did not see man, or as if man did not see God, and as if the one receded from the other? These things are said, that it may be known that all things of the doctrine of the New Jerusalem relate to love to the Lord and to love toward the neighbor. Love to the Lord is to have faith in the Lord and to do His commandments, and to do His commandments is love toward the neighbor, because to do His commandments is to do uses to the neighbor. That they love the Lord who do His commandments, the Lord Himself teaches in <a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>; and that love to God and love toward the neighbor are the two commandments upon which hang all the Law and the Prophets, (<a href="3927/matthew_22_35.htm">Matthew 22:35-38</a>); by "the Law and the Prophets" is meant the Word in its whole complex. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 903 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>903. "Et in illis nomina duodecim Apostolorum Agni," significat omnia doctrinae ex Verbo de Domino et de Vita secundum praecepta Ipsius. -Quod in fundamentis scripta sint "nomina duodecim Apostolorum Agni," est quia per "duodecim apostolos" significatur Ecclesia Domini quoad omnia ejus (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_903/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_79" target=_top>79</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_903/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_233" target=_top>233</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_903/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_790" target=_top>790</a>), hic quoad omnia doctrinae ejus, quia nomina illorum scripta sunt super "duodecim fundamentis," per quae significantur omnia doctrinae Novae Hierosolymae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_903/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_902" target=_top>902</a>); per "duodecim nomina" significatur omne quale ejus, et omne quale ejus se refert ad duo in Doctrina et inde in Ecclesia illa, de Domino et de Vita secundum percepta Ipsius; ideo haec significantur. Quod omnia Doctrinae Novae Hierosolymae se referant ad illa duo, est quia sunt universalia ejus, ex quibus omnia singularia pendent, et sunt essentialia ex quibus omnia formalia procedunt; sunt inde sicut anima et vita omnium doctrinae ejus: sunt quidem duo, sed non potest unum separari ab altero, nam separare illa foret sicut separare Dominum ab homine, et hominem a Domino; et tunc non est Ecclesia. Haec duo conjuncta sunt sicut duae tabulae Legis, quarum una continet illa quae Domini sunt, et altera quae hominis; quare vocantur foedus, et foedus significat conjunctionem. Cogita quid foret cum illis tabulis Legis, si prima solum exstaret et altera avelleretur, vel si altera exstaret et prima avelleretur; annon foret sicut Deus non videret hominem, aut sicut homo non videret Deum, et sicut recederet unus ab altero. Haec dicta sunt, ut sciatur quod omnia Doctrinae Novae Hierosolymae se referant ad amorem in Dominum et ad amorem erga proximum: amor in Dominum est fidem in Dominum habere et facere praecepta Ipsius; et facere praecepta Ipsius est amor erga proximum, quoniam facere praecepta Ipsius est usus facere proximo. Quod illi ament Dominum qui faciunt praecepta Ipsius, Ipse Dominus docet apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_903/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_21-24" target=_top>Johannem 14:21-24</a>; et quod amor in Deum et amor erga proximum sint duo praecepta ex quibus pendent Lex et Prophetae, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_903/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_22_35-38" target=_top>Matthaeus 22:35-38</a>; per "Legem et Prophetas," intelligitur Verbum in toto complexu. </p>
