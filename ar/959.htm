<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>959.要知道，这些话并不是说从这书中诸如以字义所写的话上删去什么的人，而是说从在其灵义中的教义真理上删去什么的人；对此，我会解释由来：主所口授的圣言经由其属天国度的天堂，和其属灵国度的天堂而来，进而抵达人这里，再由此人记录下来；所以，就其最初源头而言，圣言纯粹是神性。这圣言在经过主的属天国度的天堂时，就是属天神性；在经过其属灵国度的天堂时，就是属灵神性；当抵达人那里时，就变成了属世神性。正因如此，圣言的属世之义本身包含属灵之义，属灵之义又包含属天之义，而属灵和属天之义皆包含纯粹的神性意义，神性意义并未显现给任何人，甚至没有显现给任何天使。之所以提及这些事，是叫人们明白，不可从启示录中所写的事上“加添或删去”什么在天上是指，不可从关于主和对主之信的真理上加添或删去什么。字义正是来自这层意义和关于遵行主诫命的生活的真理，如前所述。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 959</h4><p>959. That people may know that this warning does not apply to someone who takes away from the words of this book as it is written in the literal sense, but to someone who takes away from the doctrinal truths contained in its spiritual sense, let me say why this is:<p>The Word that was dictated by the Lord passed through the heavens of His celestial and spiritual kingdoms and so came to the person by whom it was written. Consequently the Word in its first origin is something purely Divine. As it passed through the heavens of the Lord's celestial kingdom, it became Divinely celestial, and as it passed through the heavens of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, it became Divinely spiritual, and when it came to the person it became Divinely natural. As a result, the Word's natural sense contains within it a spiritual sense, and this in turn a celestial sense, and both a sense purely Divine, which is not apparent to any man, and not even to any angel.<p>We relate this in order that people may see that not adding anything to the words written in the book of Revelation and not taking anything away from them means in heaven not to add anything to or take away anything from the doctrinal truths regarding the Lord and faith in Him. For it is this sense, including truths regarding a life in accordance with the Lord's commandments, from which, as we said, the literal sense originated. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 959</h4><p>959. In order that it may be known that by these words is not understood one who takes away from the words of this book as it has been written in the sense of the letter, but one who takes away from the truths of doctrine which are in the spiritual sense of it, I will state whence this is. The Word that was dictated by the Lord passed across the heavens of His celestial kingdom and the heavens of His spiritual kingdom, and thus came to the man by means of whom it was written; and therefore the Word in its first origin is purely Divine. This Word when it passed across the heavens of the Lord's celestial kingdom was the celestial Divine, and when it passed across the heavens of the Lord's spiritual kingdom was the spiritual Divine, and when it came to the man it became the natural Divine. As the result of this the natural sense of the Word contains in itself the spiritual sense, and this sense contains the celestial sense, and both of them the purely Divine sense which is not open to any man nor indeed to any angel. These things are adduced so that it can be seen what is understood in heaven by 'one shall not add nor take away' anything from the things written in the Apocalypse, [namely] that one shall not add nor take away anything from the truths of the doctrine concerning the Lord and concerning faith directed to Him. For it is this meaning, also that concerning a life 'in accordance with His precepts,' from which the sense of the letter is derived, as has been said. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 959</h4><p>959. That it may be known that by these words is not meant he who "takes away from the words of this book" as it is written in the literal sense, but he who takes away from the truths of doctrine which are in its spiritual sense, I will explain whence this is: The Word, which was dictated by the Lord, passed through the heavens of His celestial kingdom, and the heavens of His spiritual kingdom, and thus came to the man through whom it was written; wherefore the Word in its first origin is purely Divine. This Word, as it passed through the heavens of the Lord's celestial kingdom, was Divine celestial, and as it passed through the heavens of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, was Divine spiritual, and when it came to man, it became Divine natural. Hence it is that the natural sense of the Word contains in itself the spiritual sense, and this the celestial sense, and both a sense purely Divine, which does not appear to any man nor indeed to any angel. These things are adduced that it may be seen, that by "not adding nor taking away" anything from what is written in Revelation is meant in heaven, that not anything is to be added or taken away from the truths of doctrine concerning the Lord and concerning faith in Him. For it is this sense, and truth concerning life according to His commandments, from which is the sense of the letter, as has been said. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 959 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>959. Ut sciatur quod per haec non intelligatur qui "aufert ex verbis hujus Libri" sicut scriptus est in Sensu literae, sed qui aufert ex veris doctrinae quae sunt in Sensu spirituali ejus, dicam unde hoc est: Verbum, quod dictatum est a Domino, transivit Caelos Regni caelestis et Caelos Regni spiritualis Ipsius, et sic venit ad hominem per quem scriptum est; quare Verbum in sua prima origine est pure Divinum: hoc dum transivit Caelos Regni caelestis Domini fuit Divinum caeleste, et dum transivit Caelos Regni spiritualis Domini fuit Divinum spirituale, et cum venit ad hominem factum est Divinum naturale; inde est quod Sensus naturalis Verbi in se contineat Sensum spiritualem, et hic Sensum caelestem, et uterque Sensum pure Divinum, qui non alicui homini et ne quidem alicui angelo patet. Haec allata sunt, ut videri possit, quod per "non addetur nec auferetur" aliquid ex scriptis in Apocalypsi intelligatur in Caelo quod non aliquid ex veris Doctrinae de Domino et de Fide in Ipsum; hic enim sensus est, et de Vita secundum praecepta Ipsius, ex quo Sensus literae est, ut dictum est. </p>
