<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第259节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>259.“有谁配展开那书卷、揭开那七印呢”表谁有能力知道天上、地上所有人的生命状态，并照其状态审判各人呢？“谁配”表示谁能或谁有能力。“展开那书卷、揭开那七印”在此表示知道天上、地上所有人的生命状态，并照其状态审判各人。因为当“书卷展开”时，他们的品质就受到审查，然后受审判或宣判，好比法官照法律文本审判并依法执行。“展开书卷”表示审查每一个人生命状态的品质，这一点从下一章明显可知，那里描述了羔羊依次揭开七印时约翰所看到的一切。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 259</h4><p>259. "Who is worthy to open the book and to loose its seals?" This symbolically means, Who has the power to know the states of life of all in heaven and on earth and to judge each one according to his state?<p>"Who is worthy?" symbolically means, "Who can, or who has the power?" To open the book and to loose its seals means here, symbolically, to know the states of life of all in heaven and on earth and also to judge each one according to his state; for when the book is opened, an inquiry takes place into the people's character, followed by a verdict or judgment, comparatively as a judge judges with the book of the law and in accordance with it.<p>That opening the book symbolizes an inquiry into the character of each and every person's state of life is apparent from the following chapter, which describes what John saw when the Lamb opened its seven seals one by one. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 259</h4><p>259. Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof?' signifies Who is in the power of getting to know the states of life of all in the heavens and on earth (in terris), and of judging each one in accordance with his own [state]? 'Who is worthy?' signifies who is able or who is in the power? 'To open the book and to loose the seals thereof' here signifies to get to know the states of life of all in the heavens and on earth, and also to judge each one in accordance with his own state, for when the book is opened there is an inquiry regarding their quality, and then the sentence or judgment, comparatively as a judge gives judgment (agit) with and out of a book of law. That by 'to open the book' is signified an inquiry regarding the quality of the states of life with all and with each one is plain from the following chapter, where what was seen when the Lamb opened the seven seals thereof in their order is described. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 259</h4><p>259. Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof? signifies who has power to know the states of life of all in the heavens and on the earth, and to judge everyone according to his state? "Who is worthy?" signifies who is able, or who has the power? "to open the book and to loose the seals thereof," signifies here to know the states of life of all in the heavens and on the earth, and also to judge everyone according to his state; for when "the book is opened," there is an examination into their quality, and then sentence or judgment, comparatively as a judge does with a book of the law and acts from it. That by "opening the book," is signified investigation into the quality of the states of life in all and everyone, is evident from the following chapter, where is described what was seen, when the Lamb opened the seven seals in their order. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 259 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>259. "Quis est dignus aperire librum et solare sigilla ejus," significat quis in potentia est nosse status vitae omnium in Caelis et in Terris, et judicare unumquemvis secundum suum. - "Quis dignus est" significat quis potest, seu quis in potentia est; "aperire librum, et solvere sigilla ejus" significat hic nosse status vitae omnium in Caelis et in terris, et quoque judicare unumquemvis secundum suum statum, nam cum "Liber aperitur," fit inquisitio quales sunt, et dein sententia seu judicium; comparative sicut judex agit cum libro legis et ex illo: quod per "aperire librum" significetur inquisitio qualis status vitae est omnibus et singulis, patet a capite sequente, ubi describitur quid visum est, cum Agnus aperuit in suo ordine septem sigilla ejus. </p>
