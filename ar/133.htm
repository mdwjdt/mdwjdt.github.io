<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第133节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>133.“那自称是先知的”表使这信成为教会的教义本身，并整个神学建于其上的人。在圣言中，“先知”表示教会的教义（参看<a href="8.htm">8</a>节）；因此，“女先知”所表相同。众所周知，在改革宗基督教会，唯信已被作为得救的唯一方法而被接纳，故仁之行为因不能拯救而已经与信分离。因此缘故，如今，被称为神学的人救赎的全部教义就是这种信，所以它就是“妇人耶洗别”。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 133</h4><p>133. "'Who calls herself a prophetess.'" This symbolically means, and who make that faith the central doctrine of the church and found their whole theology upon it.<p>A prophet in the Word symbolizes the doctrine of the church, as may be seen in no. <a href="8.htm">8</a> above, and so likewise does a prophetess.<p>As people know, the Protestant Reformed Christian Church has accepted faith alone as the only means of salvation, and therefore works of charity have been divorced from faith as being not saving. As a result, the entire doctrine of human salvation, called theology, consists today of that faith, and accordingly is "the woman Jezebel." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 133</h4><p>133. 'Calling herself a prophetess' signifies and who make that faith the doctrine itself of the Church, and found all theology upon it. That by a 'prophet' in the Word the doctrine of the Church is signified may be seen above (<a href="8.htm">8</a>); therefore it is in like manner signified by 'prophetess.' It is known that in the Reformed Christian Church faith alone has been accepted as the one only means of salvation, and that consequently the works of charity, as not saving, have been separated from faith. As a result of this the entire doctrine of the salvation of man, which is called Theology, is at this day such a faith, consequently it is 'the woman Jezebel. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 133</h4><p>133. Who calleth herself a prophetess, signifies and who make it the very doctrine of the church, and found all theology upon it. That by "prophet" in the Word is signified the doctrine of the church, may be seen above, (<a href="8.htm">8</a>); therefore the like is signified by "prophetess." It is known that in the Reformed Christian church faith alone has been accepted as the only means of salvation, and that thence the works of charity have been separated from faith, as not saving; hence it is that the entire doctrine of the salvation of man, which is called theology, at this day is that faith, consequently "the woman Jezebel." </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 133 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>133. "Dicentem se prophetissam," significat et qui illam faciunt ipsam doctrinam Ecclesiae, et super illa condunt omnem Theologiam. Quod per "prophetam "in Verbo significetur doctrina Ecclesiae, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_133/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_8" target=_top>8</a>); similiter, itaque per "prophetissam." Quod in Ecclesia Christiana Reformata acceptata sit sola fides pro unico medio salvationis, et quod inde opera charitatis sicut non salvifica a fide separata sint, notum est; inde est, quod universa Doctrina salvationis hominis, quae vocatur Theologia, hodie sit illa fides, proinde "mulier Jesabel." </p>
