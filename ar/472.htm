<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第472节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>472.“呼喊完了，就有七雷发声”表主将在整个天堂揭开小书卷里的内容。这个含义是显而易见的，因为经上接着就说到，约翰想将这七雷所说的“写出来”，但从天上来的命令是“要封上，不可写出来”；后来要他吃尽小书卷，在口中甜如蜜，肚子却发苦，以此表示其中这类事尚不能被接受；原因可见于下一节。但我要揭开小书卷里的内容。小书卷的那些事就包含在《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》从头至尾中，如下所示：</p><p>整本圣经都论及主，主就是圣言（<a href="../lord/1.htm">1</a>-<a href="../lord/7.htm">7</a>节）；主应验了圣言的全部就意味着祂应验了律法的全部（<a href="../lord/8.htm">8</a>-<a href="../lord/11.htm">11</a>节）；主降世征服地狱并荣耀了祂的人性，十字架受难是最后的争战，祂以此彻底征服地狱，完全荣耀了祂的人性（<a href="../lord/12.htm">12</a>-<a href="../lord/14.htm">14</a>节）；主并非藉着十字架受难除去罪，只是担当了它们（<a href="../lord/15.htm">15</a>-<a href="../lord/17.htm">17</a>节）；主功德的归算无非是悔改之后罪得赦免（<a href="../lord/18.htm">18</a>节）；就其神性人而言，主被称为神的儿子，就圣言而言，祂被称为人子（<a href="../lord/19.htm">19</a>-<a href="../lord/28.htm">28</a>节）；主通过祂自己里面的神性使祂的人性变成神性，从而与父合一（<a href="../lord/29.htm">29</a>-<a href="../lord/36.htm">36</a>节）；主是神本身，圣言来自并论及祂（<a href="../lord/37.htm">37</a>-<a href="../lord/44.htm">44</a>节）；神只有一位，主就是这神（<a href="../lord/45.htm">45</a>节）；圣灵就是主所发出的神性，就是主自己（<a href="../lord/46.htm">46</a>-<a href="../lord/54.htm">54</a>节）；只要将三位格的三位一体理解为在主里面的一位格的三位一体，那么《亚他那修信经》中的教义就合乎真理（<a href="../lord/55.htm">55</a>-<a href="../lord/61.htm">61</a>节）。</p><p>经上之所以说“七雷发声”，是因为主的话经由天堂降至低层区域时，听上去就像打雷；由于祂同时通过整个天堂说话，因而是完全的，故它们被称为“七”雷，因为数字“七”表示全部，一切事物和整体（<a href="10.htm">10</a>，<a href="390.htm">390</a>节），因此“雷声”还表示教导和对真理的领受（<a href="236.htm">236</a>节）；在此也表示揭开并显明。天上来的声音当来自主时，听上去就像打雷。这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>耶稣说，父啊，愿你荣耀你的名；当时就有声音从天上来，说，我已经荣耀了我的名，还要再荣耀；众人听见这声音就像打雷。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.28.htm">12:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.30.htm">30</a>）</p><p>神发声吼叫，以自己的威严之声打雷。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯37.4.htm">37:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯37.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p>耶和华从天上打雷，至高者发出声音。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下22.14.htm">22:14</a>）</p><p>我听见从天上有声音，像大雷的声音。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.2.htm">14:2</a>）</p><p>你向我呼求，我在雷的隐密处应允你。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗81.7.htm">81:7</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 472</h4><p>472. And when he cried out, seven thunders uttered their voices. This symbolically means that the Lord has disclosed throughout the whole of heaven what is in the little book.<p>This is the symbolic meaning, because we read next that John wished to write what the seven thunders said, but that he was told from heaven to seal those things up and not to write them, and later that he ate the little book, which in his mouth was as sweet as honey, but made his stomach bitter. The symbolic meaning is that present within were such things as would not yet be accepted. The reason may be seen in the next number.<p>But now I will reveal what the little book had in it. The little book had in it the same contents as found from beginning to end in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord, which are as follows:</p><p>[2] The Sacred Scripture throughout has the Lord as its subject, and the Lord is the Word (nos. <a href="../lord/1.htm">1-7</a>).<p>The Lord's fulfilling all things of the Law <sup>1</sup>means that He fulfilled all things of the Word (nos. <a href="../lord/8.htm">8-11</a>).<p>The Lord came into the world to conquer the hells and glorify His humanity, and His suffering of the cross was the final battle by which He fully overcame the hells and fully glorified His humanity (nos. <a href="../lord/12.htm">12-14</a>).<p>By His suffering of the cross the Lord did not take away sins, but bore them (nos. <a href="../lord/15.htm">15-17</a>).<p>Any imputation of the Lord's merit is simply the forgiveness of sins following repentance (no. <a href="../lord/18.htm">18</a>).<p>The Lord is called the Son of God in relation to His Divine humanity, and the Son of Man in relation to the Word (nos. <a href="../lord/19.htm">19-28</a>).<p>The Lord made His humanity Divine from the Divinity in Him, and thus became one with the Father (nos. <a href="../lord/29.htm">29-36</a>).<p>The Lord is God Himself, from whom the Word originated and who is the subject of the Word (nos. <a href="../lord/37.htm">37-44</a>).<p>There is one God, and the Lord is that God (no. <a href="../lord/45.htm">45</a>).<p>The Holy Spirit is the Divinity emanating from the Lord, and it is the Lord Himself (nos. <a href="../lord/46.htm">46-54</a>).<p>The doctrine of the Athanasian Creed accords with the truth, provided a trinity of persons is interpreted to mean a trinity of person, which is present in the Lord (nos. <a href="../lord/55.htm">55-61</a>).</p><p>[3] We are told that the seven thunders uttered their voices because the Lord's speech descending through the heavens into the lower regions sounds like thunder. And because He speaks at the same time throughout the whole of heaven, thus in fullness, there are said to be seven thunders, for the number seven means, symbolically, all people or all things, and thus completeness (nos. <a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="390.htm">390</a>). Consequently thunder also symbolizes instruction and a perception of truth (no. <a href="236.htm">236</a>), and here discovery and disclosure as well.<p>That a voice from heaven sounds like thunder when it comes from the Lord is apparent from the following:<p>(Jesus said,) "Father, glorify Your name." Then a voice came from heaven, saying, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again." (<a href="3927/john_12_28.htm">John 12:28-30</a>)<p>The multitude heard this as thunder.<p>(God roars with His voice;) He thunders with His majestic voice... (<a href="3927/job_37_4.htm">Job 37:4-5</a>)<p>Jehovah thundered from heaven, and the Most High uttered His voice. (<a href="3927/2-samuel_22_14.htm">2 Samuel 22:14</a>)<p>I heard a voice from heaven... like the voice of loud thunder. (<a href="3927/revelation_14_2.htm">Revelation 14:2</a>)<p>You called... and... I answered you in secret with thunder. (<a href="3927/psalms_81_7.htm">Psalms 81:7</a>)<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="3927/luke_24_44.htm">Luke 24:44</a> </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 472</h4><p>472. 'And when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices' signifies that the Lord has disclosed throughout the entire heaven what is in the little book. This is signified because it follows on that he wanted to write the things that the seven thunders had spoken, but that it was said to him out of heaven that he should seal them up and not write. And [it continues] afterwards that he ate the little book up, and that in his mouth it was sweet as honey, but that it resulted in his belly's being made bitter, by which is signified that such things were in it as would not be received till now. The reason may be seen in the following paragraph. But I will open what was in the little book. In the little book were those things that are contained in THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD, from the beginning to the end, and they are as follows:</p><p>[2] That the entire Sacred Scripture is concerning the Lord, and that the Lord is the Word, (<a href="../lord/1.htm">1-7</a>).<p>That the Lord fulfilled all things of the Law is equivalent to His fulfilling all things of the Word, (<a href="../lord/8.htm">8-11</a>).<p>That the Lord came into the world in order that He might bring the hells under control and glorify the Human, and that the passion of the cross was the last combat, by means of which He fully overcame the hells and fully glorified His Human (<a href="../lord/12.htm">12-14</a>).<p>That the Lord did not take sins away by means of the passion of the cross, but that He bore them, (<a href="../lord/15.htm">15-17</a>).<p>That the imputation of the Lord's merit is nothing else than the remission of sins after repentance, (<a href="../lord/18.htm">18</a>).<p>That the Lord as to the Divine Human is termed the Son of God, and as to the Word is termed the Son of Man, (<a href="../lord/19.htm">19-28</a>).<p>That the Lord made His Human Divine out of the Divine in Himself, and that in such a manner He became one with the Father, (<a href="../lord/29.htm">29-36</a>).<p>That the Lord is God Himself from Whom and concerning Whom is the Word, (<a href="../lord/37.htm">37-44</a>).<p>That God is one, and that the Lord is that God, (<a href="../lord/45.htm">45</a>).<p>That the Holy Spirit is the Divine proceeding from the Lord, and that It is the Lord Himself, (<a href="../lord/46.htm">46-54</a>).<p>That the Doctrine of the Athanasian Faith is in agreement with the truth (veritas), only so long as by a Trinity of Persons is understood the Trinity of Person that is in the Lord, (<a href="../lord/55.htm">55-61</a>).</p><p>[3] It is said that 'the seven thunders uttered their voices' because the Lord's speech, fallen down into lower regions, is heard as thunder; and because He speaks at the same time throughout the whole heaven, thus fully, there are said to be 'seven thunders,' for by 'seven' are signified all, all things, and the whole, (<a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="391.htm">391</a>); and therefore also by 'thunder' is signified instruction and the perception of truth, (<a href="236.htm">236</a>), here also disclosure and manifestation. That a voice out of heaven is heard as thunder whenever it is from the Lord is plain from these [words]:<p>Jesus said, Father glorify Thy Name, and there came forth a voice out of heaven and said, I have both glorified it and I will glorify it. The crowd heard this as thunder. <a href="3927/john_12_28.htm">John 12:28-30</a>.<p>God roars with His voice, He thunders with the voice of majesty, <a href="3927/job_37_4.htm">Job 37:4-5</a>.<p>Jehovah has thundered out of heaven, and the Most High has uttered His voice, <a href="3927/2-samuel_22_14.htm">2 Samuel 22:14</a>.<p>I heard a voice out of heaven as the voice of a great thunder. <a href="3927/revelation_14_2.htm">Revelation 14:2</a>.<p>Thou calledst Me, and I answered thee in hidden thunder. <a href="3927/psalms_81_7.htm">Psalms 81:7</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_81_8.htm">8</a>]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 472</h4><p>472. And when he cried, seven thunders uttered their voices signifies that the Lord throughout the entire heaven disclosed what was in the little book. This signification is evident, because it presently follows, that he wished "to write what the seven thunders uttered," but was enjoined from heaven "to seal it up and not to write it;" and afterwards "to eat up the little book;" and that "in his mouth it was sweet as honey" but that "it made his belly bitter;" by which is signified that such things were in it as could not yet be received: the reason may be seen in the following article. But I will open what was in the little book. In the little book were those things which are contained in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Concerning the Lord, from beginning to end, which are as follows:</p><p>[2] That the whole Sacred Scripture is concerning the Lord, and that the Lord is the Word, (<a href="1.htm">1-7</a>).<p>That by the Lord fulfilled all things of the law is meant that He fulfilled all things of the Word, (<a href="8.htm">8-11</a>).<p>That the Lord came into the world to subdue the hells and glorify His Human, and that the passion of the cross was the last combat, by which He fully conquered the hells, and fully glorified His Human, (<a href="12.htm">12-14</a>).<p>That the Lord, by the passion of the cross, did not take away sins, but that He bore them (n. . 15-17).<p>That the imputation of the Lord's merit is nothing else than the remission of sins after repentance (n. . 18).<p>That the Lord, as to His Divine Human, is called the Son of God, and, as to the Word, He is called the Son of man, (<a href="19.htm">19-28</a>).<p>That the Lord made His Human Divine from the Divine in Himself, and thus He became one with the Father (n. . 29-36).<p>That the Lord is God Himself, from whom and concerning whom the Word is, (<a href="37.htm">37-44</a>).<p>That there is one God, and that the Lord is that God, (<a href="45.htm">45</a>).<p>That the Holy Spirit is the Divine proceeding from the Lord, and that it is the Lord Himself, (<a href="46.htm">46-54</a>).<p>That the doctrine of the Athanasian faith agrees with the truth, if only by a Trinity of Persons is understood a Trinity of Person, which is in the Lord (n. . 55-61).</p><p>[3] The reason why it is said that "the seven thunders uttered their voices," is, because what the Lord speaks, as it descends through the heavens into the lower parts, is heard as thunder; and because He speaks through the whole heaven at once, and thus fully, they are called "seven" thunders, for by "seven" are signified all, all things, and the whole, (<a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="391.htm">391</a>); therefore also by "thunder" is signified instruction and the perception of truth, (<a href="236.htm">236</a>); here also disclosure and manifestation. That a voice from heaven is heard as thunder, when from the Lord, is evident from these passages:<p>Jesus said, Father, glorify Thy name: and there came forth a voice out of heaven, and said, I have glorified it, and I will glorify it: the multitude heard this as thunder, (<a href="3927/john_12_28.htm">John 12:28-30</a>).<p>God roareth with His voice, He thundereth with the voice of majesty, (<a href="3927/job_37_4.htm">Job 37:4-5</a>).<p>Jehovah thundered out of heaven, and the Most High uttered His voice, (<a href="3927/2-samuel_22_14.htm">2 Samuel 22:14</a>).<p>I heard a voice out of heaven, as the voice of great thunder, (<a href="3927/revelation_14_2.htm">Revelation 14:2</a>).<p>Thou calledst unto me, and I answered thee in secret thunder, (<a href="3927/psalms_81_7.htm">Psalms 81:7</a>). </p>
