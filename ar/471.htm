<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>471.启10:3.“大声呼喊，好像狮子吼叫”表为教会从祂那里被夺走而深切悲痛。“好像狮子吼叫的呼喊”表示对教会的深切悲痛，因为教会从祂那里被夺走；这一点从前一章的解读明显可知，那里论到那些属教会之人可悲的生命状态被审查并显明；还可从本章的经文清楚看出来，即：“天使指着那直活到永永远远的，起誓说，不再有时日了”，以此表示不再有教会了；这一点也清楚可见于下一章，即：“从无底坑上来的兽杀死两个见证人”，尤其从祂尽管是天地之神，却得不到承认和靠近明显看出来。对这些事的悲痛以“好像狮子吼叫”来表示，因为狮子一看见敌人，并被它们袭击，以及看见幼崽和猎物被抢去，就会吼叫；相比之下，主在看到祂的教会被魔鬼夺走时也是如此。</p><p>这就是“好像狮子吼叫”所表示的，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>许多牧人来攻击他的时候，狮子和少壮狮子怎样护食咆哮，耶和华也必怎样降临，在锡安山上争战。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.4.htm">31:4</a>）</p><p>耶和华的怒气向祂的百姓发作，吼叫像母狮，咆哮像少壮狮子，咆哮抓食；只见黑暗、焦虑、光明在其毁灭中变为昏暗。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.25.htm">5:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.30.htm">30</a>）</p><p>耶和华必从高处吼叫，从圣所发声；祂要向祂的居民怒吼。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.30.htm">25:30</a>）</p><p>耶和华必从锡安吼叫，从耶路撒冷出声。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.16.htm">3:16</a>）</p><p>我不再毁灭以法莲；他们必跟随耶和华；祂一吼叫，必如狮子吼叫。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何11.9.htm">11:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何11.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>狮子吼叫，谁不惧怕呢？主耶和华一说话，谁能不说预言呢？（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩3.8.htm">3:8</a>）</p><p>神以祂的声音吼叫，祂以自己的威严之声打雷。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯37.4.htm">37:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯37.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p>“吼叫”（roaring或译唉哼）表示深切悲痛，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：</p><p>我的骨头因终日唉哼而衰残。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗32.3.htm">32:3</a>）</p><p>我已经疲乏无力，被压得粉碎了；因心里的吼叫，我就唉哼。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗38.8.htm">38:8</a>）</p><p>我未曾吃饭就发出叹息，我的唉哼如水涌出。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯3.24.htm">3:24</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 471</h4><p>471. And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars. (<a href="3927/revelation_10_3.htm">10:3</a>) This symbolizes a grievous lamentation that the church was taken from Him.<p>That to cry aloud as when a lion roars symbolizes a grievous lamentation over the church, which was taken from Him, is apparent from the explanations in the preceding chapter, where the states of life of people in the church were examined and exposed, states that were lamentable. It is apparent also from the following declaration in this chapter, that the angel swore by Him who lives forever and ever that there should be no more time, which symbolically means that there would be no more church. And in the next chapter as well, that the beast ascending from the bottomless pit killed His two witnesses. Especially is it apparent from the fact that people do not acknowledge the Lord and turn to Him, even though He is God of heaven and earth.<p>A lamentation over this is what the angel's roaring like a lion symbolizes; for a lion roars when it sees its enemies and is attacked by them, and when it sees its young or its prey carried off. The same is comparatively the case with the Lord when He sees His church carried off by devils.</p><p>[2] That this is the symbolic meaning of roaring like a lion can be seen from the following passages:<p>As a lion roars, and a young lion over his prey, when a multitude of shepherds comes against him..., so Jehovah of Hosts will come down to fight upon Mount Zion... (<a href="3927/isaiah_31_4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>)<p>...the anger of Jehovah is kindled against His people... His roaring is like that of a lion, He roars like young lions; He growls and lays hold of the prey... (For) behold, darkness and distress; and the light is darkened in its ruins. (<a href="3927/isaiah_5_25.htm">Isaiah 5:25-30</a>)<p>Jehovah will roar from on high, and utter His voice from His holy habitation; He will roar mightily against His habitations. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_25_30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>)<p>Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter His voice from Jerusalem. (<a href="3927/joel_3_16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>)<p>I will not... destroy Ephraim... They shall go after Jehovah. He will roar like a lion, for He will roar... (<a href="3927/hosea_11_9.htm">Hosea 11:9-10</a>)<p>A lion roars. Who does not fear? The Lord Jehovih has spoken. Who will not prophesy? (<a href="3927/amos_3_8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>)<p>(God) roars with His voice; He thunders with His majestic voice... (<a href="3927/job_37_4.htm">Job 37:4-5</a>)<p>That roaring symbolizes a grievous lamentation is clear from the following passages:<p>...my bones grew old through my roaring all the day long. (<a href="3927/psalms_32_3.htm">Psalms 32:3</a>)<p>I am feeble and worn; I have roared because of the roaring of my heart. (<a href="3927/psalms_38_8.htm">Psalms 38:8</a>)<p>...my sighing comes before bread, and my roarings pour out like water. (<a href="3927/job_3_24.htm">Job 3:24</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 471</h4><p>471. [verse 3] 'And he cried with a great voice as a lion roars' signifies grievous lamentation that the Church has been taken away from Him. That by 'to cry as a lion roars' is signified grievous lamentation about the Church, and that it has been taken away from Him, is plain from the expositions in the preceding chapter, where the states of life of those who belong to the Church, which were lamentable, were examined and made manifest. [It is plain] also from these [words] in this chapter that 'the angel swore by the One living for ages of ages that time shall not be any more,' by which is signified that the Church [shall be] no more; as also [from those] in the following chapter that the 'beast coming up out of the deep' killed His two witnesses; and especially from His not being acknowledged and approached, although He is the God of heaven and earth. Lamentation about these things is signified by his roaring 'as a lion,' for a lion roars when he sees his enemies and their assaults, and when he sees his whelps and prey taken away. So comparatively does the Lord, when He sees His Church taken away by devils.</p><p>[2] That this is signified by 'to roar as a lion' can be established from these passages:<p>Like as the lion and the young lion roars over his prey, when a multitude of shepherds rush against him, so Jehovah Zebaoth comes down to serve [as a soldier] upon Mount Zion. <a href="3927/isaiah_31_4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>.<p>The anger of Jehovah has been kindled against His people, He has a roar like the lion's, He roars like young lions, and He growls and seizes the prey; for behold, darkness, anxiety, and the light is darkened in the ruins thereof. <a href="3927/isaiah_5_25.htm">Isaiah 5:25-30</a>.<p>Jehovah shall roar from on high, and utter a sound out of the habitation of His holiness, roaring He shall roar against His habitation. <a href="3927/jeremiah_25_29.htm">Jeremiah 25:29-31</a>.<p>Jehovah shall roar out of Zion, and out of Jerusalem shall He utter His voice. <a href="3927/joel_3_16.htm">Joel 3:16</a> [H.B. 4:16].<p>I will not destroy Ephraim; they shall go after Jehovah, as a lion shall roar, because He shall roar, <a href="3927/hosea_11_9.htm">Hosea 11:9-10</a>.<p>The lion has roared, who should not fear? The Lord Jehovih has spoken, who should not prophesy? <a href="3927/amos_3_7.htm">Amos 3:7-8</a>.<p>God roars with His voice, He thunders with the voice of His majesty, <a href="3927/job_37_4.htm">Job 37:4-5</a>.<p>That 'roaring' signifies grievous lamentation is established from these statements:<p>My bones have become old through my roaring every day. <a href="3927/psalms_32_3.htm">Psalms 32:3</a>.<p>I am disabled and worn out, I have roared above the roaring of my heart. <a href="3927/psalms_38_8.htm">Psalms 38:8</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_38_9.htm">9</a>].<p>Before bread is my sighing, and my roarings are poured out like the waters, <a href="3927/job_3_24.htm">Job 3:24</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 471</h4><p>471. Verse 3. And cried with a great voice, as a lion roareth, signifies grievous lamentation that the church has been taken away from Him. That by "crying as a lion roareth" is signified grievous lamentation respecting the church, and that it has been taken away from Him is evident from what is explained in the foregoing chapter, where the states of life of those who are of the church were explored and made manifest, which were lamentable; also from its being said in this chapter, that "the angel swore by him that liveth for ages of ages, that there should be time no longer," by which is signified that there would be no church; and, in the following chapter, that "the beast, which came up out of the abyss, killed his two witnesses;" and especially from his not being acknowledged and approached, although He is the God of heaven and earth. Lamentation concerning these things is signified by "His roaring as a lion," for a lion roars when he sees his enemies and is assaulted by them, and when he sees his whelps and prey taken away; so does the Lord, comparatively, when He sees His church taken away from Him by devils.</p><p>[2] That this is what is signified by "roaring as a lion" may appear from these passages:<p>As the lion roareth, and the young lion, over its prey, when plenty of shepherds go forth against him, so Jehovah Zebaoth cometh down to fight for Mount Zion, (<a href="3927/isaiah_31_4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>).<p>The anger of Jehovah was kindled against His people, His roaring is like a lion's, He roareth like the young lions, and He growleth and seizeth the prey; for, behold, darkness, anxiety, and the light is darkened in the ruins thereof, (<a href="3927/isaiah_5_25.htm">Isaiah 5:25-30</a>).<p>Jehovah shall roar from on high, and shall utter His voice from the habitation of His holiness; roaring He shall roar against His habitations, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_25_30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>).<p>Jehovah shall roar out of Zion, and shall utter His voice out of Jerusalem, (<a href="3927/joel_3_16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>).<p>I will not destroy Ephraim; they shall go after Jehovah; as a lion shall He roar, because He shall roar, (<a href="3927/hosea_11_9.htm">Hosea 11:9-10</a>).<p>The lion roareth, who shall not fear? the Lord Jehovah hath spoken, who shall not prophesy, (<a href="3927/amos_3_8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>)?<p>God roareth with His voice, He thundereth with the voice of His majesty, (<a href="3927/job_37_4.htm">Job 37:4-5</a>).<p>That "roaring" signifies grievous lamentation is evident from these:<p>My bones have become old through my roaring all the day, (<a href="3927/psalms_32_3.htm">Psalms 32:3</a>).<p>I am feeble and broken; I have roared because of the roaring of my heart, (<a href="3927/psalms_38_8.htm">Psalms 38:8</a>).<p>My sighing is before my bread, and my roarings are poured out like water, (<a href="3927/job_3_24.htm">Job 3:24</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 471 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>471. (Vers. 3.) "Et clamavit voce magna sicut leo rugit," significat lamentationem gravem quod Ipsi Ecclesia sit ablata. - Quod per "clamare sicut leo rugit" significetur lamentatio gravis de Ecclesia, et quod illa Ipsi sit ablata, patet ab explicatis in praecedente capite, ubi explorati et manifestati sunt status vitae illorum qui ab Ecclesia, qui erant lamentabiles; tum ab his in hoc capite, quod "Angelus juraverit per Viventem in saecula saeculorum, quod tempus non erit amplius," per quod significatur quod non Ecclesia; ut et in sequente capite, quod "Bestia ascendens ex abysso occiderit binos Testes Ipsius;" imprimis quod non agnoscatur et adeatur, tametsi est Deus Caeli et Terrae. Lamentatio de his significatur per quod "rugiverit sicut leo;" leo enim rugit cum videt hostes suos et insultus eorum, et cum videt auferri catulos suos et praedam suam; ita comparative Dominus, cum videt auferri Ecclesiam Suam a diabolis: quod hoc per "rugire sicut leo" significetur, constare potest ex his locis: <p>"Quemadmodum Rugit Leo et juvenis Leo super rapina sua, cum occurrit contra illum plenitudo pastorum, sic descendit Jehovah Zebaoth ad militandum super monte Sionis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_31_4" target=_top>Esaias 31:4</a>);<p>"Ira accensa est Jehovae contra populum Ipsius; Rugitus Illi sicut Leonis, Rugit sicut Leones juvenes, et fremit et apprehendit praedam; quia ecce tenebrae, anxietas, et lux obtenebrescit in ruinis suis," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_5_25-30" target=_top>Esaias 5:25-30</a>);<p>"Jehovah ex alto Rugiet, et ex Habitaculo sanctitatis Suae edet vocem; Fugiendo Rugiet contra habitacula Sua," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_jeremiah_25_30" target=_top>Jeremias 25:30</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>"Jehovah e Sione Rugiet, et ex Hierosolyma dabit vocem Suam," (Joel 4:16 (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_joel_3_16" target=_top>3:16</a>));<p>"Non perdam Ephraimum; post Jehovam ibunt; sicut Leo Rugiet; quia ille Rugiet," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_hosea_11_9-10" target=_top>Hoschea 11:9-10</a>); <sup>2</sup><p>"Leo Rugit, quis non timeat; Dominus Jehovih locutus est, quis non prophetet," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_amos_3_8" target=_top>Amos 3:8</a>); <sup>3</sup><p>"Deus Rugit voce Sua, tonat voce majestatis Suae," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_job_36_4" target=_top>Hiob 36:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_job_36_5" target=_top>5</a>).<p>Quod "rugitus" significet lamentationem gravem constat ex his: <p>"Inveterata sunt ossa mea per Rugitum meum omni die," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_32_3" target=_top>Psalm 32:3</a>);<p>"Debilitatus et contritus sum; Rugivi, prae Rugitu cordis mei," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_38_9" target=_top>Psalm 38:9</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_38_8" target=_top>8</a>));<p>"Ante panem suspirium meum, et effunduntur sicut aquae Rugitus mei," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_471/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_job_3_24" target=_top>Hiob 3:24</a>).<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;30 pro "29, 30, 31"<p>2.&nbsp;9, 10 pro "10, 11"<p>3.&nbsp;8 pro "7, 8" </p>
