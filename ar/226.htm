<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第226节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>226.“我初次听见好像吹号的声音和我说话，说，你上到这里来”表神性流注和由此而来的心智的提升，以及随后明显的觉知。从天上听见的“声音”是指所流入的神性真理（参看<a href="37.htm">37</a>，<a href="50.htm">50</a>节），因而是指神性流注；“吹号的声音”表示明显的觉知（参看<a href="37.htm">37</a>节）；“上到这里来”表示心智的提升；因为在灵界，人上升得越高，就进入越纯的光中，认知凭这光而逐层被开启，也就是心智被提升。由此也可知，那时“他在灵里”意思是，他进入属灵的状态，在此状态下，诸天堂中的事物清楚显现。这声音听上去之所以如同吹号的声音，是因为此处论述的是为最后审判而对诸天堂的安排；每当进行召集和作出安排时，就会听见天上如同吹号的声音。在以色列人当中，一切事物都是天堂和教会的代表，故经上还吩咐：</p><p>他们要用银子做号筒，亚伦的子孙要吹号召集会众和起行，在快乐的日子和节期并月初，献燔祭，也要吹号，这是为纪念和战争。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.1.htm">10:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>等到解释第八章时，我们会论及“号”和“吹”号，那里提到了七位天使，七枝号被赐予了他们。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 226</h4><p>226. And the first voice that I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, "Come up here." This symbolizes a Divine influx, resulting in an elevation of the mind and consequent clear perception.<p>When a voice is heard from heaven, it means Divine truth flowing in (see nos. <a href="37.htm">37</a>, <a href="50.htm">50</a> above), thus a Divine influx. And a voice like a trumpet symbolizes a clear perception (see again no. <a href="37.htm">37</a> above). "Come up here," moreover, symbolizes an elevation of the mind, for in the spiritual world, the higher one ascends, the purer the light that he comes into, by which the intellect is progressively opened or the mind elevated. Consequently the statement also follows that John was then in the spirit, meaning that he was conveyed into a spiritual state, in which the things found in heaven clearly appear.<p>The voice sounded like a trumpet because the subject is the organization of the heavens for a last judgment. Moreover voices like trumpets are heard in heaven when assemblies and organizations are taking place. Consequently in the case of the children of Israel also, with whom everything was representative of heaven and the church, it was a statute that they make trumpets of silver, and that the sons of Aaron sound them to assemble the congregation; to decamp; on days of celebration; at festivals; at the beginnings of months; upon the offering of sacrifices; as a memorial; and to go to war (<a href="3927/numbers_10_1.htm">Numbers 10:1-10</a>).<p>But we shall speak of trumpets and the sounding of them in our exposition of chapter 8, where the subject is the seven angels who were given seven trumpets. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 226</h4><p>226. 'And the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was saying, Come up hither' signifies Divine influx, and the resulting elevation of mind, and a manifest perception then. It may be seen above (<a href="37.htm">37</a>, <a href="50.htm">50</a>) that a 'voice,' when it is heard out of heaven, is Divine Truth inflowing, thus a Divine influx; and that by a voice 'like a trumpet' is signified a manifest perception (also above <a href="37.htm">37</a>); and by 'Come up hither' an elevation of mind is signified; for in the spiritual world the higher one goes up, the purer the light one comes into, by which means the understanding is opened by degrees, that is, the mind is elevated. It follows also, therefore, that he then 'came to be in the spirit.' By this is understood that he was let into a spiritual state in which the things that are in heaven appear manifestly. Because it treats of the setting of the heavens in order for the last judgment, the voice was heard 'like a trumpet'; and voices as of a trumpet are heard in heaven when assemblies and arrangements in order take place. Therefore also with the sons of Israel, among whom all things were representative of heaven and the Church, it was a statute that they should make trumpets out of silver, and that the sons of Aaron should make a sound with them for assemblies, for departures, in days of gladness, at festivals, in the beginnings of months, over the sacrifices, for a memorial, and for war. <a href="3927/numbers_10_1.htm">Numbers 10:1-10</a>.<p>But [something] will be said about 'trumpets' and 'sounding' through them, in the exposition of chapter <a href="3927/revelation_8_6.htm">8:6</a>, where it treats of the seven angels to whom seven trumpets were given. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 226</h4><p>226. And the first voice which I heard, as of a trumpet speaking with me, said, Come up hither, signifies Divine influx, and thence an elevation of the mind, and then manifest perception. That "a voice," when heard from heaven, is the inflowing Divine truth may be seen above, (<a href="37.htm">37</a>, <a href="50.htm">50</a>), thus Divine influx; and that by "a voice as of a trumpet," is signified manifest perception, may also be seen, (<a href="37.htm">37</a>) above, (<a href="37.htm">37</a>); and by "Come up hither," is signified elevation of the mind; for in the spiritual world, the higher anyone ascends, so much the more does he come into purer light, by which the understanding is by degrees opened, that is, the mind is elevated. Therefore it also follows, that he was then in the spirit, by which is meant that he was let into a spiritual state, in which the things which are in the heavens manifestly appear. The voice was heard "as of a trumpet," because it treats of the arrangement of the heavens for the Last Judgment; and voices as of a trumpet are heard in heaven when convocations and arrangements are made. Therefore also among the sons of Israel with whom all things were representative of heaven and the church, it was also commanded:<p>That they should make trumpets of silver, and that the sons of Aaron should sound them for the calling of assemblies, and for the journeyings, in days of rejoicing, in festivals, in the beginnings of months, over burnt offerings, for a memorial, and for war, (<a href="3927/numbers_10_1.htm">Numbers 10:1-10</a>).<p>But we shall speak of "trumpets," and of "sounding" them, in the explanation of chap. 8, where the seven angels are mentioned, to whom were given seven trumpets. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 226 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>226. "Et vox prima, quam audivi, instar tubae loquentis me cum, dicebat, Ascende hoc," significat influxum Divinum, et inde elevationem mentis, et tunc manifestam perceptionem. - Quod "vox," cum e Caelo auditur, sit Divinum Verum influens, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_226/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_37" target=_top>37</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_226/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_50" target=_top>50</a>), ita influxus Divinus; et quod per "vocem instar tubae" significetur perceptio manifesta, etiam supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_226/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_37" target=_top>37</a>); et per "ascende huc" significatur elevatio mentis, nam in spirituali mundo, quo altius quis ascendit, eo in puriorem lucem venit, per quam intellectus per gradus aperitur, hoc est, mens elevatur; quare etiam sequitur, quod tunc factus sit in spiritu, per quod intelligitur quod immissus in statum spiritualem, in quo manifeste apparent illa quae in Caelis sunt. Quod vox illa audita sit "instar tubae," est quia agitur de Ordinatione Caelorum ad Ultimum Judicium; et voces sicut tubae audiuntur in Caelo, cum convocationes et ordinationes fiunt; quare etiam apud filios Israelis, apud quos omnia fuerunt repraesentativa Caeli et Ecclesiae, statutum fuit, <p>Ut Tubae ex argento conficerentur, et quod filii Aharonis illis clangerent ad convocationes, ad profectiones, in diebus laetitiae, in festis, in principiis mensium, super sacrificiis, ad memoriale, et ad bellum, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_226/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_numbers_10_1-10" target=_top>Numeri 10:1-10</a>). <sup>1</sup><p>Sed de "tubis" et de "clangore" per illas, in explicatione capitis octavi, ubi de septem Angelis, quibus datae sunt septem tubae, dicetur.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;1-10 pro "1 ad 11" </p>
