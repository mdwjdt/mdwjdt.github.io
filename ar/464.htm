<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 464</h4><p>464. CHAPTER 10<p>1. I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud, with a rainbow over his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.<p>2. He had in his hand a little book open, and he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,<p>3. and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars; and when he cried out, seven thunders uttered their voices.<p>4. Now when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, "Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and do not write them."<p>5. Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his hand to heaven<p>6. and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there should be no more time,<p>7. but in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, the mystery of God would be concluded, as He declared to His servants the prophets.<p>8. Then the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again and said, "Go, take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the earth."<p>9. So I went to the angel and said to him, "Give me the little book." And he said to me, "Take and eat it; and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey."<p>10. Then I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it, and in my mouth it was as sweet as honey. But when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.<p>11. And he said to me, "You must prophesy again about peoples, nations, tongues, and many kings."<p>THE SPIRITUAL MEANING<p>The Contents of the Whole Chapter<p>This chapter has as its subject the examination and exposure of people in the Protestant Reformed churches - here as to what they believe with respect to the Lord's being God of heaven and earth, as He Himself taught (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>), and with respect to His humanity's being Divine - something that has not been accepted there, and which can with difficulty be accepted, as long as the dogma of justification by faith alone resides in their hearts.<p>The Contents of the Individual Verses:<p></p><table><thead><tr><th>Verse Contents</th><th>Spiritual Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 464</h4><p>464. THE TENTH CHAPTER<p>1. And I saw another angel, a strong one, coming down out of heaven, encompassed with a cloud, and a rainbow overhead, and His face as the sun, and His feet as pillars of fire.<p>2. And he had in his hand a little book opened, and he set his right foot upon the sea, and the left one upon the land.<p>3. And he cried with a great voice, as a lion roars, and when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.<p>4. And when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was going to write, and I heard a voice out of heaven saying unto me, Seal up the things that the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.<p>5. And the angel, whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the land, lifted up his hand into heaven.<p>6. And swore by the One living for ages of ages, Who created heaven and the things therein, and the land and the things therein, and the sea and the things therein, that time shall not be any more.<p>7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is going to sound, and the mystery of God shall be accomplished, as He has declared to His servants the prophets.<p>8. And the voice that I heard out of heaven [was] speaking with me again, and saying, Go, take the little book opened in the hand of the angel standing upon [the sea and upon] the land.<p>9. And I went unto the angel, saying unto him, Give me the little book, and he said unto me, Take it and eat it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey.<p>10. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up, and it was in my mouth as sweet honey, and when I ate it up my belly was made bitter.<p>11. And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again about (super) peoples and nations and tongues and many kings.<p>THE SPIRITUAL SENSE<p>THE CONTENTS OF THE WHOLE CHAPTER<p>It still treats of the examination and making manifest [to show the state] of those who are in the Churches of the Reformed, here what they believe concerning the Lord, as being the God of heaven and earth, as He Himself taught (<a href="3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>); and that His Human is Divine: also that this has not been received there, and that it can be received with difficulty so long as the dogma of justification by faith alone is firmly fixed in [their] hearts.<p>THE CONTENTS OF EACH OF THE VERSES<p>1. And I saw another angel, a strong one, coming down out of heaven, signifies the Lord in Divine Majesty and Power.<p>Encompassed with a cloud, and a rainbow overhead, signifies His Natural Divine and Spiritual Divine.<p>And His face as the sun, signifies Divine Love, and at the same time Divine Wisdom.<p>And His feet as pillars of fire, signifies the Lord's Natural Divine as to Divine Love which supports all things.<p>2. And he had in his hand a little book opened, signifies the Word as to this [point] of doctrine there, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that His Human is Divine.<p>And he set his right foot upon the sea and the left one upon the land, signifies that the Lord has the entire Church under His auspices and dominion.<p>3. And he cried with a great voice as a lion roars, signifies grievous lamentation that the Church has been taken away from Him.<p>And when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices, signifies that the Lord has disclosed throughout the entire heaven what is in the little book.<p>4. And when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was going to write, and I heard a voice out of heaven saying unto me, Seal up the things that the seven thunders have uttered, and write them not, signifies that these things are indeed made manifest, but that they are not received until after those who are understood by the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet, have been cast out of the world of spirits, because of the danger if [they were received] before.<p>5. And the angel, whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the land, lifted up his hand into heaven, [<a href="6.htm">6</a>] and swore by the One living for ages of ages, signifies the Lord's attestation and testification by His Very Self.<p>Who created heaven and the things therein, and the land and the things therein, and the sea and the things therein, signifies Who makes all who are in heaven and who are in the Church, and all the things with them collectively and separately, alive.<p>That time shall not be any more, signifies that there shall not be any state of the Church or any Church, unless the one God is acknowledged, and that the Lord is He.<p>7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is going to sound, signifies the final examination and making manifest of the state of the Church, which is going to perish if a New one is not set up by the Lord.<p>And the mystery of God shall be accomplished, as He has declared to His servants the prophets, signifies that then it is going to become apparent that it has been foretold in the Word of both Testaments, and has been concealed up to this time, that after a last judgment upon those who have devastated the Church the Lord's kingdom is going to come.<p>8. And the voice that I heard out of heaven [was] speaking with me again, saying, Receive the little book opened in the hand of the angel standing upon the sea and upon the land, signifies a command out of heaven that they should draw out that doctrine [concerning the Lord], but that it should be made manifest by means of John how it would be received in the Church before those were removed who are understood by the dragon, the beast and the false prophet.<p>9. And I went unto the angel, saying unto him, Give me the little book, signifies a movement of the mind with many [in the Church] towards receiving the doctrine.<p>And he said unto me, Take it and eat it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey, signifies that a reception resulting from the acknowledgment that the Lord is the Saviour and Redeemer is agreeable and pleasant, but that the acknowledgment that He Only is the God of heaven and earth, and that His Human is Divine, is disagreeable and difficult because of falsifications.<p>10. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up, and it was in my mouth as sweet honey, and when I ate it up my belly was made bitter, signifies it was so done, and thus was made manifest.<p>11. And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again about (super) peoples and nations and tongues and many kings, signifies because it is so, the quality of those who are in faith alone must be further taught.<p>THE EXPOSITION<p>In this and the following chapter it treats of the Lord, that He is the God of heaven and earth, and that He is God even as to His Human; consequently that Jehovah is He Himself. That it treats of this Truth (de Hoc) in these two chapters can be seen by virtue of the details in the spiritual sense, and of the conclusion thereof (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_11_15.htm">11:15-17</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 464</h4><p>464. Revelation 10<p>1.

"And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven," signifies the Lord in Divine majesty and power, (<a href="465.htm">465</a>). "Encompassed with a cloud, and a rainbow was over his head," signifies His Divine natural and Divine spiritual, (<a href="466.htm">466</a>). "And his face was as the sun," signifies the Divine love, and at the same time the Divine wisdom, (<a href="467.htm">467</a>).

"And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it up, my belly was made bitter," signifies that so it came to pass, and was thus manifested, (<a href="482.htm">482</a>).<p>Verse 11. "And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings," signifies that because it is so, the quality of those who are in faith alone must be further shown, (<a href="483.htm">483</a>).<p>THE EXPLANATION.<p>In this and the following chapter the Lord is treated of, that He is the God of heaven and earth, and that as to His Human also He is God; consequently that He is Jehovah Himself.

Et habebat in manu Sua Libellum apertum et posuit pedem Suum dextrum super mari, et Sinistrum super terra. <p>3. Et clamavit voce magna, sicut leo rugit, et cum clamavit locuta sunt septem tonitrua suas voces. <p>4. Et cum locuta sunt septem tonitrua voces suas, futurus sum scribere, et audivi vocem e Caelo dicentem mihi, Obsigna quae locuta sunt septem tonitrua, et ne illa scribas. <p>5. Et Angelus, Quem vidi stantem super mari et super terra, sustulit manum Suam in Caelum. <p>6. Et juravit per Viventem in saecula saeculorum, - Qui creavit Caelum et quae in eo, et Terram et quae in ea, et Mare et quae in eo, quod tempus non erit amplius. <p>7. Sed in diebus vocis septimi Angeli, quando futurus est Clangere et consummabitur mysterium Dei, sicut evangelizavit Suis servis Prophetis. <p>8. Et vox, quam audivi e Caelo, iterum loquens cum me, et dicens, Abi, accipe Libellum apertum in manu Angeli stantis super (mari et super) terra. <p>9. Et abivi ad Angelum, dicens Ei, Da mihi Libellum; et dixit mihi, Accipe et devora illum, et amaricabit tuum ventrem, sed in ore tuo erit dulcis sicut mel. <p>10. Et accepit Libellum e manu Angeli, et devoravi illum, et erat in ore meo sicut mel dulcis; et cum devoravi illum amaricatus est venter meus. <p>11. Et dixit mihi, Oportet te iterum prophetare super populos et gentes et linguas et reges multos. <p>SENSUS SPIRITUALIS. <p>CONTENTUM TOTIUS CAPITIS. <p>AGITUR ADHUC DE EXPLORATIONE ET MANIFESTATIONE ILLORUM QUI IN ECCLESIIS REFORMATORUM SUNT: HIC QUID CREDUNT DE DOMINO, <p>QUOD SIT DEUS CAELI ET TERRA (ut Ipse docuit, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_464/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_28_18" target=_top>Matthaeus 28:18</a>), ET QUOD HUMANUM IPSIUS SIT DIVINUM; <p>ET QUOD HOC IBI NON RECEPTUM SIT, ET QUOD AEGRE POSSIT RECIPI, QUAMDIU DOGMA DE JUSTIFICATIONE PER SOLAM FIDEM CORDIBUS INSIDET. <p>CONTENTA SINGULORUM VERSUUM. <p>1. "Et vidi alium Angelum fortem descendentem e Caelo," significat Dominum in Divina Majestate et Potentia (465); "circumdatum nube, et iris supra caput," significat Divinum Naturale et Divinum Spirituale Ipsius (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_464/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_469" target=_top>469</a>); "et facies Ejus sicut sol," significat Divinum Amorem et simul Divinam Sapientiam (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_464/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_467" target=_top>467</a>); "et pedes Ejus sicut columnae ignis," significat Divinum Naturale Domini quoad Divinum Amorem, quod sustentat omnia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_464/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_468" target=_top>468</a>).<p>2.

"Et clamavit voce magna sicut leo rugit," significat lamentationem gravem quod Ipsi Ecclesia sit ablata (n;. 471); "et cum clamavit, locuta sunt septem tonitrua voces suas," significat quod Dominus per universum Caelum detexerit quid in Libello (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_464/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_472" target=_top>472</a>).<p>4. "Et cum locuta sunt septem tonitrua voces suas, futurus sum scribere, et audivi vocem e Caelo dicentem mihi, Obsigna quae locuta sunt septem tonitrua, et ne illa scribas," significat quod illa quidem manifestentur, sed quod non recipiantur quam postquam illi, qui per "Draconem," "Bestiam" et "Pseudoprophetam" intelliguntur, e mundo spirituum ejecti sunt, quia periculum si prius (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_464/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_473" target=_top>473</a>).<p>5., 6.

"Sed in diebus vocis septimi Angeli, quando futurus clangere," significat explorationem et manifestationem status Ecclesiae finalem, quod peritura sit, si non Nova a Domino instauretur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_464/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_477" target=_top>477</a>); "et consummabitur mysterium Dei, sicut evangelizavit Suis servis Prophetis," significat quod tunc appariturum sit quod in Verbo utriusque Testamenti praedictum est et hactenus occultatum, quod post Ultimum Judicium super illos qui devastaverunt Ecclesiam, venturum sit Regnum Domini (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_464/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_478" target=_top>478</a>).<p>8. "Et vox quam audivi e Caelo iterum loquens cum me, dicens, Recipe libellum apertum in manu Angeli stantis super mari et super terra," significat mandatum e Caelo ut haurirent illam Doctrinam, sed ut manifestaretur per Johannem quomodo illa in Ecclesia reciperetur, antequam illi qui per "Draconem," "Bestiam" et "Pseudoprophetam" intelliguntur, remoti sunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_464/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_479" target=_top>479</a>).<p>9.

"Et accepi libellum e manu Angeli et devoravi illum, et erat in ore meo sicut mel dulcis; et cum devoravi illum, amaricatus est venter meus," significat ita factum, et sic manifestatum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_464/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_482" target=_top>482</a>).<p>11. "Et dixit mihi, Oportet te iterum prophetare super populos et gentes et linguas et reges multos," significat quod quia ita est, adhuc docendum sit quales sunt qui in sola fide (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_464/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_483" target=_top>483</a>).<p>EXPLICATIO. <p>In hoc et in Sequente capite agitur de Domino, quod sit Deus Caeli et Terrae, et quod sit Deus etiam quoad Humanum; consequenter quod Jehovah sit Ipse. Quod de hoc in binis his capitibus agatur, videri potest ex singulis in Sensu spirituali, et ex clausula eorum, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_464/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_11_15" target=_top>11:15</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_464/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_11_16" target=_top>16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_464/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_11_17" target=_top>17</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Qui pro "Et Qui" </p>
