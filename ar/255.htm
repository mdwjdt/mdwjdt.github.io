<p>255.对此，我补充一则记事。为免有人进入圣言的灵义，败坏属于灵义的纯正真理，主设立了守卫，这些守卫就是基路伯，也就是此处的“四活物”所指的。设立守卫的事实以如下方式呈现给我。</p><p>我被恩准看到几个大钱袋，里面装着大量银子。钱袋是敞开的，似乎谁都可以拿里面的银子，甚至夺走它。不过，钱袋旁边坐着两位天使，他们是守卫。放钱袋的地方看似马厩里的马槽。隔壁房间有一些端庄的童女和一位贞洁的妻子，房间附近站着两个小孩子，我被告知，别把他们当作小孩子玩耍，而要视他们为智者。后来，一个妓女出现了，再后来出现了一匹躺着的死马。</p><p>看到这些景象，我得到指教，含有灵义的圣言字义就是通过它们来代表。装满银子的大钱袋表示对真理和良善的大量认知。钱袋敞开，却又有天使看管的事实，表示谁都能由此为自己获取这些认知，但务必小心，免得有人歪曲灵义，因为灵义包含赤裸的真理。放钱袋的马厩中的马槽表示适用于认知的属灵教导。马槽具有这种含义，主降生时所卧的马槽也具有这种含义，是因为在马槽吃草的马表示对圣言的理解。</p><p>隔壁房间所看到的端庄童女表示对真理的情感，贞洁的妻子表示良善与真理的结合。小孩子表示圣言中智慧的纯真。他们是出于第三层天的天使，都看似小孩子。妓女和死马表示如今许多人对真理的歪曲，对真理的全部理解由此丧失了。妓女表示歪曲，死马表示对真理没有任何理解。</p><p>主许我与许多死后的人交谈，他们以为自己将在天堂闪耀如星辰。因为如他们所说，他们视圣言为神圣，经常通读，从中搜集许多经文，证实他们的信条，由此在世人面前被尊为饱学之士。因此，他们以为自己将成为米迦勒或拉斐尔。但是，他们当中许多接受检查，以查看他们出于哪种爱研究圣言。结果发现，有的是出于自我之爱，以便他们在世人面前显得很伟大，并身为教会的大主教而受到崇拜；有的人是出于尘世之爱，为了获得财富。当检查这些人对圣言的认识时，发现他们对其中的纯正真理一无所知，只知道一些被歪曲的真理而已，这种真理本身是虚假；在灵界，这会刺激天使的鼻孔。他们被告知，这种认知是因为他们以自己和尘世为目的，或也可说，以他们的爱，而非主与天堂为目的。当他们的目的是自己和尘世时，他们在阅读圣言期间，心思专注于自己和尘世，因而总是出于自己的自我来思想，这自我在属于天堂的一切事上，都处在幽暗之中。在这种状态下，人无法从自己的光中退离，从而被提升进入天堂之光，也就不能从主经由天堂接收任何流注。</p><p>我还看见这些人被允许进入天堂，当被发现没有真理时，他们被剥去衣服，露出下体。那些歪曲真理的人因发臭而被扔了出去，但他们仍然骄傲自大、信心满满，觉得自己应得。而那些出于对认识真理的情感，为了真理和促进属灵生活的功用，并且不仅为他们自己，还为他们的邻舍而研究圣言的人则不同。我看见这些人被举升天堂，从而进入那里圣言所在之光，同时被提升到天使的智慧及其幸福，也就是永生中。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 255</h4><p>255. To this I will append the following account:<p>To prevent someone from entering into the spiritual meaning of the Word and perverting the genuine truth found in that meaning, the Lord has set protections, which in the Word are meant by cherubim, which is what the four living creatures here are.<p>That protections have been set was represented to me in the following way:</p><p>[2] I was given to see large purses, looking like sacks, which had stored away in them a great deal of silver. And since they were open, it seemed as if anyone might take the silver deposited in them, even to make off with it, but next to those purses two angels were sitting as guards. The place where the purses rested looked like a manger in a stable. In the next room I saw modest maidens, together with a chaste wife. Near that room were two little children, and I heard it said that they were not to be played with in a childish way, but wisely. And afterward a harlot appeared, then a horse lying dead.</p><p>[3] Having seen these things, I was told that they represented the literal meaning of the Word, which has a spiritual meaning within. The large purses full of silver symbolized concepts of truth and goodness in great abundance. The purses' being open and yet guarded by angels, meant symbolically that anyone might acquire concepts of truth there, but that one should take care not to falsify the spiritual meaning, which contains only truths.<p>The manger in the stable where the purses were sitting symbolized spiritual instruction for the intellect. (A manger has this symbolism, like the manger where the newborn Lord lay, because a horse, which eats from it, symbolizes an understanding of the Word.)</p><p>[4] The modest maidens I saw in the next room symbolized affections for truth, and the chaste wife the conjunction of truth and good. The little children symbolized the innocence of the wisdom in the Word (they were angels from the third heaven, all of whom appear like little children). The harlot together with the dead horse symbolized the falsification of the Word by many people today, by which all understanding of the truth has perished. (A harlot symbolizes falsification, and a dead horse no understanding of truth.)</p><p>[5] I have been given to speak with many people after death who believed they would shine like stars in heaven. They believed this, they said, because they held the Word holy, read it often, took many things from it, and used them to defend the tenets of their faith. As a result they were celebrated as learned in the world, so that they believed they would become Michaels or Raphaels. <sup>1</sup>A number of them were examined, however, to see what love prompted them to study the Word. And it was discovered that some did so out of self-love, in order to appear great in the world and to be worshiped as leaders of the church, while others did so out of a love of the world, in order to acquire riches.<p>When they were explored to discover what they knew from the Word, they were found to know no genuine truth, but only what we call falsified truth, which in itself is false; and in the spiritual world this stinks in the nostrils of angels. Moreover the people were told that this was the case with them because their objectives were focused on themselves and the world, or to say the same thing, on their loves of these, and not on the Lord and heaven. And when people have themselves and the world as their focus, then when they read the Word their mind fastens on themselves and the world, and therefore they think continually in accord with their self-interest, which is in darkness regarding everything connected with heaven. In this state a person cannot be withdrawn from his own light and so be raised into the light of heaven. Consequently, neither can he receive anything flowing in from the Lord through heaven.</p><p>[6] I have also seen people like this let into heaven. But when they were discovered to be without truths, they were divested of their clothing and were seen with their private parts exposed. And because those who had falsified truths stunk, they were expelled. Still, however, there remained in them the conceit and confidence that they were deserving.<p>The outcome was different with people who had studied the Word out of an affection for knowing the truth because it is true, and because it served the useful ends of a spiritual life, not only their own life, but their neighbor's as well. I saw them raised into heaven and so into the light in which Divine truth exists there, and raised at the same time then into angelic wisdom and into its felicity, which is eternal life.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;I.e., archangels. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 255</h4><p>255. To these things I will add this MEMORABLE OCCURRENCE. Lest anyone should enter into the spiritual sense of the Word and pervert the genuine truths pertaining to that sense, guards have been placed by the Lord, and these are understood by the cherubs, which here are the 'four animals.' The fact that guards have been placed has been represented to me in this manner:</p><p>[2] It was granted to see large purses appearing like sacks, in which silver was stowed away in great abundance; and as they had been opened, it seemed as if any one was able to take out the silver stored there, even to snatch it away. But close by the purses were sitting two angels, who were guards. The place where they had been stored appeared like a manger in a stable. In the next compartment modest virgins were seen with a chaste wife, and near that compartment two little children were standing, and it was said that they were to be played with, not childishly but wisely. Also afterwards a harlot appeared, then a horse lying dead.</p><p>[3] When I had seen these things, I was instructed that by means of them was represented the sense of the letter of the Word, in which is the spiritual sense. The large purses filled with silver signified cognitions of truth and good in great abundance. The fact that they had been opened and yet were guarded by the angels signified that every one was able to take the cognitions therefrom for himself, but that care is taken lest any one should falsify the spiritual sense, in which naked truths (veritas) are. The manger in the stable, in which the purses were lying, signified spiritual instruction for the understanding. A manger signifies this, so does the manger in which the infant Lord lay, because the horse that eats therefrom signifies the understanding of the Word.</p><p>[4] The modest virgins who were seen in the next compartment signified affections of truth, and the chaste wife the conjunction of good and truth. The little children signified the innocence of the wisdom in the Word. They were angels out of the third heaven, who all appear as little children. The harlot with the dead horse signified the falsification of the Word by many at this day, whereby all understanding of truth is perishing. A harlot signifies falsification, and a dead horse no understanding of truth.</p><p>[5] It was given [me] to speak with many after death who believed they were going to shine in heaven like stars, because, as they said, they held the Word to be holy, read it through very often, gathered many things therefrom by which they confirmed the dogmas of their faith, and on this account were celebrated in the world as learned men, as a result of which they believed that they were going to be Michaels and Raphaels. But many of them were examined as to the love out of which they studied the Word, and it was found that some [did so] out of the love of self so that they might appear great in the world and he worshipped as primates of the Church, but others [did so] out of the love of the world in order to gain wealth. When these were examined as to what they knew of the Word, it was discovered that they knew nothing therefrom of genuine truth, but only such truth as is called falsified, which in itself is untrue, and this in the spiritual world stinks in the nostrils of the angels. And it was told them that this [condition] was theirs on account of themselves and the world being their ends, or, what is the same, their loves, and not the Lord and heaven. And when their ends are themselves and the world, then, while they are reading the Word, their mind is fixed upon themselves and the world, and consequently they are always thinking out of their own proprium, and this is in thick darkness as to all the things that are of heaven. In this state a man cannot be withdrawn from his own light (ex lumine proprio), and so be elevated into the light (lux) of heaven, nor is he able thence to receive any influx from the Lord through heaven.</p><p>[6] I also saw these persons admitted into heaven, and when they were found to be without truths they were stripped of their garments and appeared in a shameful condition (in pudendis); and those who falsified truths were cast out, because they stank, but there still remained with them pride and confidence that they were deserving. It happened otherwise with those who studied the Word out of the affection of knowing the truth because it is true, and because it is serviceable for the uses of a spiritual life, not only their own, but their neighbour's also. I saw these raised up into heaven, and so into the light in which the Word there is, and at the same time exalted into angelic wisdom, and its happiness, which is eternal life. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 255</h4><p>255. Here I will add this Relation. Lest anyone should enter into the spiritual sense of the Word, and pervert the genuine truth which pertains to that sense, there are placed guards by the Lord, which are meant by cherubim in the Word, which are the four animals here: that guards are placed, was thus represented to me.</p><p>[2] It was given to see great purses, which seemed like bags, in which silver in great abundance was stored up; and as they were open, it was perceived as though anyone might take the silver out of them, and even carry it off. But near the purses there sat two angels who were guards. The place where they were deposited appeared like a manger in a stable; in the next apartment were seen some modest virgins with a chaste wife; and near that apartment stood two infants; and it was said, that they were not to be played with in an infantile manner, but wisely; and afterwards there appeared a harlot, and also a dead horse.</p><p>[3] On seeing which I was instructed, that by these was represented the sense of the letter of the Word, in which is the spiritual sense. The great purses full of silver signified the knowledges of truth and good in great abundance. Their being open, and yet guarded by angels, signified that anyone might take from thence the knowledges of truth, but that care is taken lest anyone should falsify the spiritual sense, in which were nothing but truths. The manger in the stable, in which the purses lay, signified spiritual instruction for the understanding; this is the signification of a manger, and the same is signified by the manger in which the Lord lay when an infant, because a horse, which eats therefrom, signifies the understanding of the Word.</p><p>[4] The modest virgins, who were seen in the adjoining apartment, signified affections of truth, and the chaste wife, the conjunction of good and truth. The infants signified the innocence of wisdom in the Word. They were angels from the third heaven, who all appear like infants. The harlot with the dead horse signified the falsification of the Word by many at this day, by which all the understanding of truth perishes; a harlot signifies falsification, and a dead horse no understanding of truth.</p><p>[5] It has been granted me to speak with many after death, who believed they should shine like stars in heaven, because, as they said, they had held the Word as holy, had read it frequently, and collected many things from it by which they had confirmed the dogmas of their faith, and were therefore celebrated as men of learning in the world, for which reason they thought they would be Michaels or Raphaels. But many of them were explored, as to the love from which they had studied the Word, and it was found, that some had studied it from self-love, that they might appear great in the world, and be reverenced as primates of the church; but others from the love of the world, that they might gain wealth. When they were examined as to what they knew from the Word, it was found, that they knew nothing of genuine truth therefrom, but only such as is called truth falsified, which in itself is falsity, and this, in the spiritual world, is a stench to the nostrils of the angels. And it was said to them that this was the case with them, because they themselves and the world were their ends, or what is the same, their loves, and not the Lord and heaven; and when themselves and the world are ends, then, when they read the Word, their mind cleaves to self and the world, and therefore they think constantly from their own proprium, which is in thick darkness as to all things of heaven. In this state man cannot be withdrawn from his own light, and so elevated into the light of heaven, nor thence receive any influx from the Lord through heaven.</p><p>[6] I also saw them admitted into heaven, and when they were found to be without truths, they were stripped of their garments and appeared in nakedness. And they who had falsified truths, were, by reason of their stench, expelled, but still their pride remained with them, and the belief in their own merit. It was otherwise with those who had studied the Word from the affection of knowing truth because it is truth, and because it subserves the uses of spiritual life, not only to a man's self, but also to his neighbor. These I saw taken up into heaven, and thus into the light, in which the Divine truth is there, and at the same time they were then exalted into angelic wisdom and its felicity, which is life eternal. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 255 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>255. His adjiciam hoc MEMORABILE: - <p>Ne aliquis in Sensum spiritualem Verbi intret, ac genuinum verum, quod illius Sensus est, pervertat, custodiae a Domino positae sunt, quae in Verbo per Cherubos, qui hic sunt quatuor Animalia, intelliguntur: quod custodiae sint positae, hoc mihi ita repraesentatum est: <p>Datum est videre magnas Crumenas; apparentes sicut sacci, in quibus reconditum fuit argentum in multa copia; et quia apertae erant, perceptum est sicut unusquisque posset argentum ibi repositum depromere, imo diripere; sed juxta Crumenas illas sedebant bini Angeli, qui custodes; locus ubi repositae erant, apparebat instar praesepis in stabulo; in camera proxima visae sunt Virgines modestae, cum Uxore casta; et prope illam cameram stabant bini Infantes, et dictum est, quod cum illis non infantiliter sed sapienter ludendum sit; et postea apparebat Scortum, tum Equus jacens mortuus. <p>Quibus visis instructus sum, quod per illa repraesentatus sit Sensus literae Verbi, in quo Sensus spiritualis est. Magnae illae Crumenae argento plenae significabant cognitiones veri et boni in multa copia: quod apertae essent, et tamen ab Angelis custoditae, significabat quod quisque posset inde cognitiones veri desumere; sed quod caveatur, ne aliquis Sensum spiritualem, in quo merae veritates sunt, falsificet. Praesepe in stabulo, in quo jacebant crumenae, significabat instructionem spiritualem pro intellectu; hoc significat praesepe, etiam praesepe in quo Dominus Infans jacuit, quia Equus, qui inde edit, significat intellectum Verbi. Virgines modestae, quae in camera proxima visae sunt, significabant affectiones veri, et Uxor casta conjunctionem boni et veri. Infantes significabant innocentiam sapientiae in Verbo; erant Angeli e tertio Caelo, qui omnes apparent sicut infantes. Scortum cum Equo mortuo significabat falsificationem Verbi a multis hodie, per quam omnis intellectus veri perit; Scortum significat falsificationem, et Equus mortuus intellectum veri nullum. <p>Datum est loqui cum multis post mortem, qui crediderunt se sicut stellae lucituros in Caelo, quia, ut dixerunt, sanctum habuerunt Verbum, saepius perlegerunt illud, plura inde collegerunt per quae fidei suae dogmata confirmaverunt, et per id in mundo ut docti celebrati sunt; ex quo credebant se Michaeles et Raphaeles futuros. Sed plures ex illis explorati sunt, ex quo amore studuerunt Verbo: ac inventi quod aliqui ex amore sui, ut magni in Mundo apparerent, et sicut Primates Ecclesiae colerentur; aliqui autem ex amore mundi, ut lucrarentur opes: hi dum explorati sunt quid scirent ex Verbo, compertum est, quod inde nihil genuini veri scirent, sed modo tale quod vocatur verum falsificatum, quod in se est falsum, et hoc in mundo spirituali putet coram naribus angelorum et dictum est illis, quod hoc illis esset ex causa, qua ipsi et mundus fuerunt fines, seu, quod idem, amores illorum, et non Dominus et Caelum; et cum ipsi et mundus sunt fines, tunc cum legunt Verbum, haeret mens illorum in se ipsis et in mundo, et inde cogitant jugiter ex suo proprio, quod in caligine est quoad omnia quae Caeli sunt: in quo statu non potest homo subduci ex lumine proprio, et sic elevari in lucem Caeli, proinde nec aliquem influxum a Domino per Caelum recipere. Vidi etiam hos in Caelum admissos, et cum inventi sunt quod absque veris essent, nudati sunt vestibus, et apparuerunt in pudendis; et qui falsificaverunt vera, quia putuerunt, expulsi sunt, sed usque remansit apud hos fastus, ac fides quod meruerint. <p>Aliter factum est cum illis, qui studuerunt Verbo ex affectione sciendi verum quia verum est, et quia inservit usibus vitae spiritualis, non solum suae, sed etiam proximi. Illos vidi elevatos in Caelum, et sic in lucem, in qua est Divinum Verum ibi, et simul tunc exaltatos in sapientiam Angelicam, et in felicitatem ejus, quae est vita aeterna. </p>
