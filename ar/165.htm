<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>165.“然而在撒狄，你还有几个名字”表他们当中还有某些人的敬拜尚有生命。“几个名字”表如下文所说那样的某些人，因为“名字”表人的品质。原因在于，在灵界，每个人都是照着自己的品质而得名（<a href="81.htm">81</a>节）。现在所论述的这些人的品质是，他们的敬拜尚有生命。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 165</h4><p>165. "'You have a few names even in Sardis.'" (<a href="3927/revelation_3_4.htm">3:4</a>) This symbolically means that they also have among them some people who do have life in their worship.<p>A few names means, symbolically, some who are of such a character as now described, for a name symbolizes someone's character. That is because everyone in the spiritual world is named in accordance with his character (no. <a href="81.htm">81</a>). The character of the people described now is that they have life in their worship. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 165</h4><p>165. [verse 4] 'Thou hast a few names even in Sardis' signifies that among them there are those who do have life in their worship. By 'a few names' are signified some who are such, as now follows; for a 'name' signifies someone quality. This is because in the spiritual world each one is named in accordance with his own quality (<a href="81.htm">81</a>). The quality of those who are now mentioned is that they may have life in their worship. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 165</h4><p>165. Verse 4. Thou hast a few names even in Sardis, signifies that among them there are also some who have life in their worship. By "a few names" are signified some who are such, as now follows, for "name" signifies the quality of anyone; the reason is that everyone in the spiritual world is named according to his quality, (<a href="81.htm">81</a>[1-4]) the quality of those who are now treated of, is, that they have life in their worship. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 165 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>165. (Vers. 4.) "Habes pauca nomina etiam in Sardibus," significat quod inter illos etiam sint, qui in cultu suo vitam habent. - Per "pauca nomina" significantur aliqui qui tales sunt, ut nunc sequitur; "nomen" enim significat quale alicujus; causa est, quia unusquisque in mundo spirituali nominatur secundum quale suum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_165/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_81" target=_top>81</a>); quale eorum, de quibus nunc, est, quod in cultu suo vitam habeant. </p>
