<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第643节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>643.“头上戴着金冠冕，手里拿着快镰刀”表源于神性之爱的神性智慧，和圣言的神性真理。“头上”所戴的“冠冕”表示智慧（参看<a href="189.htm">189</a>，<a href="252.htm">252</a>节）；“金冠冕”表示源于爱的智慧（<a href="235.htm">235</a>节）；由于这冠冕被看到戴在人子或主的头上，所以“金冠冕”表示源于主的神性之爱的神性智慧。“镰刀”之所以表示圣言的神性真理，是因为“收割”表示教会在神性真理上的状态，在此表示它的末后状态；所以用“镰刀”所进行的“收割”在此表示终结教会的状态并施行审判；由于这些事是凭借神性真理来完成的，所以这一切以“镰刀”来表示；而“快镰刀”表示精确而敏锐地行这事。“镰刀”和“剑”、“刀”、“长剑”所表相同；只是在论述收割的地方，经上会用“镰刀”；当论述战争时，经上则用“刀剑”。“剑”、“刀”和长剑”表示与虚假争战的神性真理，反之亦然（<a href="52.htm">52</a>，<a href="108.htm">108</a>，<a href="117.htm">117</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 643</h4><p>643. Having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle. This symbolizes the Divine wisdom emanating from the Lord's Divine love, and the Divine truth in the Word.<p>That a crown on the head symbolizes wisdom may be seen in nos. <a href="189.htm">189</a>, <a href="252.htm">252</a> above, and a golden crown wisdom springing from love in no. <a href="235.htm">235</a>. And because the crown was seen on the head of the Son of Man, or the Lord, the golden crown symbolizes the Divine wisdom emanating from His Divine love.<p>A sickle symbolizes the Divine truth in the Word because a harvest symbolizes the state of the church in respect to Divine truth - here its last state - and therefore to harvest, which is what a sickle is used for, here means, symbolically, to put an end to the state of the church and to execute judgment. Moreover, because these actions are accomplished by means of the Word's Divine truth, therefore this is what is symbolically meant by a sickle, and by a sharp sickle its being accomplished perfectly and flawlessly.<p>A sickle has the same symbolic meaning as swords, but a sickle is specified when the subject has to do with harvesting, while a sword is specified when the subject has to do with war.<p>That swords symbolize Divine truth combating falsities, and the converse, may be seen in nos. <a href="52.htm">52</a>, <a href="108.htm">108</a>, <a href="117.htm">117</a> above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 643</h4><p>643. 'Having upon His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle' signifies the Divine Wisdom out of His Divine Love, and the Divine Truth of the Word. That by 'a crown upon the head' is signified wisdom may be seen above (<a href="189.htm">189</a>, <a href="252.htm">252</a>); and by 'a golden crown' wisdom out of love (<a href="235.htm">235</a>). And since it was seen upon the head of the Son of Man or the Lord, by 'a golden crown' is signified the Divine Wisdom out of His Divine Love. By 'a sickle' is signified the Divine Truth of the Word because by 'the harvest' is signified the state of the Church as to Divine Truth, here its last state. Consequently by 'reaping,' which is done with a sickle, is here signified to put an end to the state of the Church and to execute judgment. And because these things are done by means of the Divine Truth of the Word, therefore this is signified by 'a sickle,' and by 'a sharp sickle' its being done accurately and carefully. By a 'sickle' the like is signified as by a 'sword' (gladius), 'short sword' (mochoero) and 'long sword' (romphaea), but it is termed 'sickle' where it treats of harvest, and 'sword' when it treats of war. That by 'sword,' 'short sword' and 'long sword' is signified Divine Truth fighting against untruths, and vice versa, may be seen above (<a href="52.htm">52</a>, <a href="108.htm">108</a>, <a href="117.htm">117</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 643</h4><p>643. Having upon His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle, signifies the Divine wisdom from His Divine love, and the Divine truth of the Word. That by "a crown upon the head" is signified wisdom, see above, (<a href="189.htm">189</a>, <a href="252.htm">252</a>); and by "a golden crown," wisdom from love, (<a href="235.htm">235</a>); and because it was seen upon the head of the Son of man, or the Lord, by "a golden crown" is signified the Divine wisdom from His Divine love. The reason why "a sickle" signifies the Divine truth of the Word, is, because by "a harvest" is signified the state of the church as to the Divine truth, here its last state; and therefore by "reaping," which is done with a sickle, is here signified to put an end to the state of the church, and to execute judgment; and because these things are done by the Divine truth of the Word, therefore this is signified by "a sickle;" and by "a sharp sickle," the doing it exactly and exquisitely. By "a sickle" the like is signified as by "a sword," "a saber," and "a long sword;" but "a sickle" is named where a harvest is treated of, and "a sword," when war is treated of. That by "a sword," "a saber," and "a long sword" is signified the Divine truth fighting against falsities, and vice versa, see above, (<a href="52.htm">52</a>, <a href="108.htm">108</a>, <a href="117.htm">117</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 643 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>643. "Habens super capite Suo coronam auream, et in manu Sua falcem acutam," significat Divinam Sapientiam ex Divino Amore Ipsius, ac Divinum Verum Verbi.--Quod per "coronam super capite" significetur sapientia, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_643/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_189" target=_top>189</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_643/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_252" target=_top>252</a>); et per "coronam auream," sapientia ex amore (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_643/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_235" target=_top>235</a>); et quia visa est super capite Filii Hominis seu Domini, per "coronam auream" significatur Divina Sapientia ex Divino Amore Ipsius. Quod per "falcem" significetur Divinum Verum Verbi, est quia per "messem" significatur status Ecclesiae quoad Divinum Verum, hic ultimus ejus status; et inde per "metere," quod fit per falcem, hic significatur statui Ecclesiae finem imponere, ac judicium facere; et quia haec fiunt per Divinum Verum Verbi, ideo hoc per "falcem" significatur; et per "falcem acutam," id exacte et exquisite. Per "falcem" simile significatur quod per "gladium," "machaeram" et "romphaeam;" sed "falx" dicitur ubi agitur de messe, at "gladius" ubi agitur de bello: quod per "gladium," "machaeram," et "romphaeam" significetur Divinum Verum pugnans contra falsa, et vicissim, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_643/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_52" target=_top>52</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_643/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_108" target=_top>108</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_643/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_117" target=_top>117</a>). </p>
