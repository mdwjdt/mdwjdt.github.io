<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>50.“祂的声音如同众水的声音”表属世的神性真理。当“声音”来自主时，它表示神性真理（参看<a href="37.htm">37</a>节）。“水”表真理，尤表属世的真理，就是出自圣言的认知。这一点可从圣言中的许多经文得以证实，仅从中引用以下经文：</p><p>认识耶和华的知识要充满遍地，好像水充满洋海一般。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.9.htm">11:9</a>）</p><p>所以你们必从救恩的泉源欢然取水。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛12.3.htm">12:3</a>）</p><p>行事公义、说话正直的，必有粮食赐给他，饮水可得保全。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.15.htm">33:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.16.htm">16</a>）</p><p>困苦穷乏人寻求水却没有，他们因口渴，舌头干燥。我要在山坡上开江河，在谷中开泉源；我要使旷野变为水池，使干地变为水泉，好叫他们看见、承认、留意、明白。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.17.htm">41:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.20.htm">20</a>）</p><p>我要将水浇灌口渴的人，使水涌流在干旱之地，我要将我的灵浇灌你的种。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.3.htm">44:3</a>）</p><p>你的光就必在黑暗中升起，你必像浇灌的园子，又像水流不绝的水泉。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.10.htm">58:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.11.htm">11</a>）</p><p>我的百姓做了两件恶事，就是离弃我这活水的泉源，为自己凿出不能存水的池子。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.13.htm">2:13</a>）</p><p>他们的贵胄打发家僮打水，他们来到池边，见没有水，就拿着空器皿回来了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.3.htm">14:3</a>）</p><p>他们离弃耶和华这活水的泉源。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.13.htm">17:13</a>）</p><p>他们要哭泣而来；我因哭泣引导他们，把他们引到正直路上的水泉旁。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.9.htm">31:9</a>）</p><p>我必折断粮的杖；他们喝水也要按制子，惊惶而喝，因自己的罪孽消灭。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.16.htm">4:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.18.htm">12:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.19.htm">19</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.14.htm">51:14</a>）</p><p>看哪，日子将到，我必打发饥荒降在地上，饥荒不是因为没有饼，干渴不是因为没有水，乃因不听耶和华的话；他们必飘流，从这海到那海；往来奔跑要听耶和华的话，却寻不着。当那日，美貌的处女和少年的男子必因干渴发昏。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩8.11.htm">8:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩8.13.htm">13</a>）</p><p>那日、必有活水从耶路撒冷出来。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.8.htm">14:8</a>）</p><p>耶和华是我的牧者，祂必领我到安静的水边。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗23.1.htm">23:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗23.2.htm">2</a>）</p><p>他们并不干渴，祂为他们使水从磐石流出，分裂磐石水就涌出。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.21.htm">48:21</a>）</p><p>神啊，我清晨寻求你，我的灵魂渴慕你，我因无水而疲乏。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗63.1.htm">63:1</a>）</p><p>耶和华发话，祂使风刮起，水便流动。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗147.18.htm">147:18</a>）</p><p>天上的天和天上的水，你们都要赞美耶和华。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.4.htm">148:4</a>）</p><p>耶稣坐在雅各泉旁，对那妇人说，凡喝这水的，还要再渴；人若喝我所赐的水，就永远不渴；我所赐的水要在他里头成为水泉，直涌到永生。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.7.htm">4:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.15.htm">15</a>）</p><p>耶稣，人若渴了，让他到我这里来喝。信我的人，就如经上所说，从他腹中要流出活水的江河来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.37.htm">7:37</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.38.htm">38</a>）</p><p>我要将生命水的泉白白赐给那口渴的人喝。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.6.htm">21:6</a>）</p><p>他指示我一道生命水的河，从神和羔羊的宝座流出来。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.1.htm">22:1</a>）</p><p>圣灵和新妇都说，来；听见的人也该说，来；口渴的人也当来，愿意的，都可以白白取生命的水。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.17.htm">22:17</a>）</p><p>在上述经文中，“水”皆表真理。由此明显可知，“众水的声音”表圣言中主的神性真理，如以下经文：</p><p>看哪，以色列神的荣光从东路而来，祂的声音如同多水的声音；地就因祂的荣耀发光。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.2.htm">43:2</a>）</p><p>我听见从天上有声音，像众水的声音。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.2.htm">14:2</a>）</p><p>耶和华的声音发在水上，耶和华在众水之上。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗29.3.htm">29:3</a>）</p><p>既知“水”在圣言中表属世人里面的真理，那么明显可知犹太教会中的各种洗濯表示什么，以及洗礼表示什么，同样知道主在约翰福音中的这些话表示什么：</p><p>人若不是从水和圣灵生的，就不能进神的国。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.5.htm">3:5</a>）</p><p>“从水生”表从真理而生，“从圣灵生”表从照着这些真理的生活而生。在相反的意义上，“水”表虚假，这一点可见于下文。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 50</h4><p>50. And His voice as the sound of many waters. This symbolizes natural Divine truth.<p>A voice, when coming from the Lord, symbolizes Divine truth, as may be seen in no. <a href="37.htm">37</a> above. Waters symbolize truths, and specifically natural truths, which are concepts from the Word, as follows from many passages in the Word, of which we cite only the following:<p>...the earth is full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea. (<a href="3927/isaiah_11_9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>)<p>With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation. (<a href="3927/isaiah_12_3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>)<p>He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly...: bread will be given him, (and) his water will be constant. (<a href="3927/isaiah_33_15.htm">Isaiah 33:15-16</a>)<p>The poor and needy seek water, but there is none; their tongue fails for thirst... I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will turn the wilderness into a pool of water, and the dry land into springs of water..., that they may see, know, consider and understand... (<a href="3927/isaiah_41_17.htm">Isaiah 41:17-18</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_41_20.htm">20</a>)<p>I will pour out water on him who is thirsty, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour out My Spirit... (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>)<p>...your light shall rise in the darkness..., that you may be like a watered garden, and like an issue of water, whose waters do not deceive. (<a href="3927/isaiah_58_10.htm">Isaiah 58:10-11</a>)<p>...My people have committed two evils: they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, and hewn themselves cisterns... that hold no water. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_2_13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>)<p>Their great ones have sent their young ones for water. They went to the cisterns and found no water. Their vessels came back empty. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_14_3.htm">Jeremiah 14:3</a>)<p>...they have forsaken Jehovah, the fountain of living waters. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_17_13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>)<p>They shall come with weeping, and with prayers I will lead them. I will lead them to a fountain of waters, in the way of rectitude... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>)<p>...I will break the staff of bread... and they shall drink water by measure and with astonishment..., so that... they waste away because of their iniquities. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_4_16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16-17</a>; cf. <a href="3927/ezekiel_12_18.htm">12:18-19</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_51_14.htm">Isaiah 51:14</a>)<p>Behold, the days will come... when I will send hunger on the land, not a hunger for bread, nor a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of Jehovah. They shall wander from sea to sea, and... shall run to and fro, to hear the word of Jehovah, but shall not find it. In that day the... young women and the young men shall faint for thirst. (<a href="3927/amos_8_11.htm">Amos 8:11-13</a>)<p>In that day... living waters shall flow from Jerusalem... (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a>)<p>Jehovah is my shepherd..., He leads me to still waters. (<a href="3927/psalms_23_1.htm">Psalms 23:1-2</a>)<p>They did not thirst...; He caused waters to flow from the rock for them, and He split the rock, so that waters gushed out. (<a href="3927/isaiah_48_21.htm">Isaiah 48:21</a>)<p>O God..., in the morning will I seek You; My soul thirsts...; ...(I am) weary, without water. (<a href="3927/psalms_63_1.htm">Psalms 63:1</a>)<p>(Jehovah) sends out His word...; He causes (the) wind to blow, so that the waters flow. (<a href="3927/psalms_147_18.htm">Psalms 147:18</a>)<p>Praise (Jehovah), you heavens of heavens, and you waters from above the heavens! (<a href="3927/psalms_148_4.htm">Psalms 148:4</a>)<p>(Jesus sitting by Jacob's well said to the woman,) "Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will not thirst to eternity. And the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life." (<a href="3927/john_4_7.htm">John 4:7-15</a>)<p>(Jesus said,) "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. Whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture says, out of his belly will flow rivers of living water." (<a href="3927/john_7_37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>)<p>To him who thirsts I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely. (<a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>)<p>He showed (him) a... river of the water of life..., proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb. (<a href="3927/revelation_22_1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>)<p>And the Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" And let him who hears say, "Come!" And let him who thirsts come. And whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely. (<a href="3927/revelation_22_17.htm">Revelation 22:17</a>)<p>Waters in these passages mean truths, and it is apparent from this that the sound of many waters means the Lord's Divine truth in the Word, as also in the following places:<p>Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east, and His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth was illumined by His glory. (<a href="3927/ezekiel_43_2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>)<p>I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of many waters... (<a href="3927/revelation_14_2.htm">Revelation 14:2</a>)<p>The voice of Jehovah is on the waters...; Jehovah is on many waters. (<a href="3927/psalms_29_3.htm">Psalms 29:3</a>)<p>When it is known that waters in the Word mean truths in the natural self, it can be seen what washings in the Israelite Church symbolized, and also what baptism symbolizes, and moreover what is symbolically meant by these words of the Lord in John,<p>Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. (<a href="3927/john_3_5.htm">John 3:5</a>)<p>"Of water" means, symbolically, "by truths," and "of the Spirit" means, symbolically, "by a life in accordance with them."<p>In an opposite sense, waters symbolize falsities, as we will see in subsequent explanations. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 50</h4><p>50. 'And His voice as the voice of many waters' signifies natural Divine Truth. That 'a voice,' when from the Lord, signifies Divine Truth may be seen above (<a href="37.htm">37</a>) . That 'waters' signify truths, and specifically the natural truths that are cognitions out of the Word, is established from many passages in the Word, out of which only the following are adduced:<p>The earth is full of the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea. <a href="3927/isaiah_11_9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>.<p>Then with joy shall you draw waters out of the fountain of salvation. <a href="3927/isaiah_12_3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>.<p>He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly, bread shall be given [him], and waters that are sure. <a href="3927/isaiah_33_15.htm">Isaiah 33:15-16</a>.<p>The poor and needy seeking water, but there is none; their tongue fails for thirst.

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 50</h4><p>50. And His voice as the voice of many waters, signifies the Divine truth natural. That a "voice" when from the Lord signifies the Divine truth, may be seen above, (<a href="37.htm">37</a>); that "waters" signify truths, and, specifically, natural truths, which are knowledges from the Word, is evident from many passages in the Word; of which only the following are adduced:<p>The earth is full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea, (<a href="3927/isaiah_11_9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>).<p>Therefore, with joy shall ye draw waters out of the fountains of salvation, (<a href="3927/isaiah_12_3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>).<p>He that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightness bread shall be given him, and water shall be sure, (<a href="3927/isaiah_33_15.htm">Isaiah 33:15-16</a>).<p>The poor and needy seek water, but there is none; their tongue faileth for thirst; I will open rivers on the hillsides, and I will put fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of waters, that they may see, acknowledge, attend and understand, (<a href="3927/isaiah_41_17.htm">Isaiah 41:17-18</a>, <a href="3927/isaiah_41_20.htm">20</a>).<p>I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground, I will pour out my spirit, (<a href="3927/isaiah_44_3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>).<p>Thy light shall rise in darkness and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of waters whose waters fail not, (<a href="3927/isaiah_58_10.htm">Isaiah 58:10-11</a>).<p>My people have committed two evils; they have deserted me, the fountain of living waters, to cut out for themselves pits, that can hold no waters, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_2_13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>).<p>And their great men sent their little ones for the waters, they came to the pits and found no waters, they returned with their vessels empty, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_14_3.htm">Jeremiah 14:3</a>).<p>They have deserted Jehovah, the fountain of living waters, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_17_13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>).<p>They shall come with weeping; and with weeping will I lead them, I will lead them to the fountain of waters in a straight way, (<a href="3927/jeremiah_31_9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>).<p>I will break the staff of bread; and they shall drink waters by measure and with astonishment, that they may consume away for their iniquities, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_4_16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16-17</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_12_18.htm">12:18-19</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_51_14.htm">Isaiah 51:14</a>).<p>Behold the days shall come, in which I will send a famine in the land, not a famine for bread, nor a thirst for waters, but for hearing the words of Jehovah; and they shall wander from sea to sea; they shall run to and fro to hear the Word of Jehovah, and shall not find it. In that day shall the virgins and youths fail for thirst, (<a href="3927/amos_8_11.htm">Amos 8:11-13</a>).<p>And it shall be in that day that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, (<a href="3927/zechariah_14_8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a>).<p>Jehovah is my shepherd, He will lead me to the waters of quietness, (<a href="3927/psalms_23_1.htm">Psalms 23:1-2</a>).<p>They shall not thirst, He will make waters to flow out of the rock for them, He will cleave the rock that the waters may flow forth, (<a href="3927/isaiah_48_21.htm">Isaiah 48:21</a>).<p>O God, I seek thee in the morning, my soul thirsteth, I am weary without waters, (<a href="3927/psalms_63_1.htm">Psalms 63:1</a>).<p>Jehovah sendeth the Word, He causeth the wind to blow, that the waters may flow, (<a href="3927/psalms_147_18.htm">Psalms 147:18</a>).<p>Praise Jehovah, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters above the heavens, (<a href="3927/psalms_148_4.htm">Psalms 148:4</a>).<p>Jesus, sitting at the fountain of Jacob, said unto the woman, Whosoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again; but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give, shall not thirst to eternity; and the water that I shall give, shall be in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life, (<a href="3927/john_4_7.htm">John 4:7-15</a>).<p>Jesus said, If anyone thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink. He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow streams of living water, (<a href="3927/john_7_37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>).<p>I will give unto him that thirsteth of the fountain of the water of life freely, (<a href="3927/revelation_21_6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>).<p>He showed me a river of water of life, going out of the throne of God, and of the Lamb, (<a href="3927/revelation_22_1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>).<p>The Spirit and the Bride say, Come; and let him that heareth say, Come; and let him that thirsteth come, and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely, (<a href="3927/revelation_22_17.htm">Revelation 22:17</a>).<p>By "waters" in these passages are meant truths; hence it is evident that by "the voice of many waters" is meant the Divine truth of the Lord in the Word; as, also, in these places:<p>Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east, and His voice was like the voice of many waters; and the earth was lighted by His glory, (<a href="3927/ezekiel_43_2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>).<p>I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters, (<a href="3927/revelation_14_2.htm">Revelation 14:2</a>).<p>The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters, Jehovah is upon many waters, (<a href="3927/psalms_29_3.htm">Psalms 29:3</a>).<p>When it is known that by "waters" in the Word are meant truths in the natural man, it may appear what was signified by washings, in the Israelitish church; and also what is signified by baptism; and likewise by these words of the Lord, in John:<p>Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God, (<a href="3927/john_3_5.htm">John 3:5</a>).<p>To be born "of water" signifies to be born by truths; and "of the Spirit" signifies by a life according to them. That "waters" in the opposite sense signify falsities, will be seen in what follows. </p>
