<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第308节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>308.“又有一把大剑赐给他”表邪恶的虚假摧毁真理。“剑”、“刀”和“长剑”表示与虚假争战并摧毁它们的真理，在反面意义上表示与真理对抗并摧毁它们的虚假（参看<a href="52.htm">52</a>节）；此处“大剑”表示摧毁良善之真理的邪恶之虚假。它们之所以被称为邪恶的虚假，是因为还存在并非邪恶之虚假的虚假，这后者不会摧毁真理，而前者却能。这就是“大剑”的含义，这一点从经上很快说到看见“黑马”明显看出来。“黑马”表示在真理方面丧失对圣言的理解，能摧毁真理的，只有邪恶。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 308</h4><p>308. And there was given to him a great sword. This symbolizes the destruction of truth by the falsities accompanying evil.<p>It may be seen in no. <a href="52.htm">52</a> above that swords symbolize truth combating falsities and destroying them, and in an opposite sense, falsity combating truths and destroying them. The great sword here symbolizes the falsities accompanying evil destroying the truths accompanying goodness.<p>We say the falsities accompanying evil, because there are falsities that are not connected with evil, and these do not destroy truths, as those accompanying evil do.<p>That this is the symbolic meaning of the great sword is apparent from the fact that a black horse is seen next, which symbolizes an understanding of the Word extinguished as to truth, and truth is extinguished only by evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 308</h4><p>308. 'And there was given unto him a great sword' signifies the destruction of truth by means of the untruths of evil. That a 'sword' (gladius), a 'short sword' (machaera), and a 'long sword' (romphaea) signify truth fighting against untruths and destroying them, and in the opposite sense untruth fighting against truths and destroying them, may be seen above (<a href="52.htm">52</a>). Here 'a great sword' signifies untruths of evil destroying truths of good. They are termed 'untruths of evil' because there are untruths not of evil, and these do not destroy truths but the former do. What is signified here by 'a great sword' is plain from the fact that presently 'a black horse' was seen, by which is signified the understanding of the Word utterly lost as to truth, and truth is not utterly lost except by means of evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 308</h4><p>308. And there was given unto him a great sword, signifies the destruction of truth by the falsities of evil. That "a sword" [gladius], "saber" [machaera], and "long sword" [romphaea] signify truth combating against falsities and destroying them, and in the opposite sense, falsity combating against truths, and destroying them, may be seen above, (<a href="52.htm">52</a>); here "a great sword" signifies the falsities of evil destroying the truths of good. They are called falsities of evil, because there are falsities which are not falsities of evil, and the latter do not destroy truths, but the former do. That such is the signification of "a great sword" is evident from its being said that presently "a black horse" was seen, by which is signified the understanding of the Word destroyed as to truth, and truth is destroyed by nothing but evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 308 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>308. "Et data ei machaera magna," significat destructionem veri per falsa mali. Quod "gladius," "machaera" et "romphaea," significent verum pugnans contra falsa et destruens illa, et in opposito sensu falsum pugnans contra vera et destruens illa, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_308/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_52" target=_top>52</a>); hic "machaera magna" significat falsa mali destruentia vera boni. Dicuntur falsa mali, quia dantur falsa non mali, et haec non destruunt vera, sed illa. Quod hoc per "machaeram magnam" significetur, patet ex eo, quod mox "equus niger" visus sit, per quem significatur intellectus Verbi deperditus quoad verum; et verum non deperditur nisi a malo. </p>
