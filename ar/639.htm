<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第639节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>639.启14:13.“我听见从天上有声音对我说，你要写下，从今以后，在主里面而死的死人有福了”表主关于那些将属于其新教会之人，也就是那些由于信主并照其诫命生活而遭受试探之人死后状态的预言，他们将拥有永生和幸福。“听见从天上有声音说”表示来自主的预言。这预言之所以涉及那些将属于主的新教会之人死后的状态，是因为本节论述的就是这状态；“从今以后而死的”表示他们死后的状态；“写下”表示为了给后人作纪念（<a href="39.htm">39</a>，<a href="63.htm">63</a>节）。“有福了”表示那些拥有永生和幸福的人，因为他们是有福的。“死人”表示那些苦待自己的灵魂，把肉体钉在十字架上，遭受诸般试探的人；下面将看到，此处“死人”就表示这些人。</p><p>那些因信主并照其诫命生活而遭受试探的人拥有永生和幸福，这一点从前文明显可知，那里经上说“圣徒的忍耐就在此；守神诫命，和耶稣基督信仰的也在此”，这句话表示新教会之人通过试探在其遵行诫命的生活和对主之信的性质上接受检查（参看<a href="638.htm">638</a>节）；这一点还可从以下经文明显看出来，即“他们息了自己的劳苦”，这句话表示那些受试探的人将在主内得平安，如下文所看到的（<a href="640.htm">640</a>节）。“试探”在此是指属灵的试探，当那些信主并照其诫命生活的人驱赶同他们在一起、与自己的欲望行如一体的恶灵时，属灵的试探就存在于他们身上。在以下经文中，这些试探在以“十字架”来表示：</p><p>不背着他的十字架跟从我的，不配作属我的。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.38.htm">10:38</a>）</p><p>耶稣说，若有人要跟从我，就当舍己，背起他的十字架来跟从我。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.24.htm">16:24</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.23.htm">9:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.25.htm">25</a> ；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.26.htm">14:26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.27.htm">27</a>）</p><p>在保罗书信中，以“把肉体钉十字架”来表示：</p><p>凡属基督的人，是已经把肉体连邪情私欲同钉十字架上了。（加拉太书<a href="http://39-27.cn/加5.24.htm">5:24</a>）</p><p>“死人”之所以表示那些苦待自己的灵魂，把肉体钉在十字架上，遭受诸般试探的人，是因为他们由此为自己先前的生活感到羞愧难当，因而在世人面前如同死去一般；因为主说：</p><p>一粒麦子不落在地里死了，仍旧是单单一粒，若是死了，就结出许多果实来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.24.htm">12:24</a>）</p><p>在约翰福音，“死人”并非表示其他任何人：</p><p>耶稣说，父怎样叫死人起来，使他们活着，子也照样随自己的意思使人活着。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.21.htm">5:21</a>）</p><p>同一福音书：</p><p>耶稣说，时候将到，死人要听见神儿子的声音，就活了。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.25.htm">5:25</a>）</p><p>“死人复活”也是这个意思（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.14.htm">14:14</a> ；启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.5.htm">20:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.13.htm">13</a>），以及其它地方（参看<a href="106.htm">106</a>节），诗篇：</p><p>在耶和华眼中，祂的圣民之死极为宝贵。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗116.15.htm">116:15</a>）</p><p>耶稣还说：</p><p>为我失丧生命的，将要得着生命。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.39.htm">10:39</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.25.htm">16:25</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.24.htm">9:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.25.htm">25</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.33.htm">17:33</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.25.htm">12:25</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 639</h4><p>639. <a href="3927/revelation_14_13.htm">14:13</a> Then I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, "Write: 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.'" This symbolizes a prediction by the Lord concerning the state of people after death who will belong to His New Church, namely that those who undergo temptations or trials because of their faith in the Lord and a life in accordance with His commandments will have eternal life and happiness.<p>To hear a voice speaking from heaven symbolizes a prediction by the Lord. It is a prediction about the state of people after death who will belong to His New Church, because that state is the subject in this verse. Those who die from now on symbolize their state after death. The injunction to write means symbolically that it be something to be remembered by people later (nos. <a href="39.htm">39</a>, <a href="63.htm">63</a>). The blessed symbolize people who have eternal life and happiness, since they are the people who are blessed. The dead symbolize people who have afflicted their soul, crucified their flesh, and undergone temptations or trials. That these are the people meant here by the dead will be seen below.</p><p>[2] Regarding those who have undergone temptations or trials because of their faith in the Lord and a life in accordance with His commandments, that they will have eternal life and happiness is apparent from the verse just preceding, which says, "Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus," which symbolically means that a New Church person will be examined through temptations or trials to discover his character as regards a life in accordance with the commandments and as regards faith in the Lord (see just above, no. <a href="638.htm">638</a>). It is apparent also from the words following, that they will have rest from their labors, which means symbolically that those who undergo temptations or trials will have peace in the Lord, as explained just below in no. <a href="640.htm">640</a>. Temptations or trials here mean spiritual temptations or trials, which occur in the case of people who have faith in the Lord and live in accordance with His commandments when they are driving away the evil spirits in them who ally themselves with their lusts. These temptations or trials are symbolically meant by a cross in the following passages:<p>Whoever does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. (<a href="3927/matthew_10_38.htm">Matthew 10:38</a>)<p>...Jesus said..., "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me. (<a href="3927/matthew_16_24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>, cf. <a href="3927/luke_9_23.htm">Luke 9:23-25</a>; <a href="3927/luke_14_26.htm">14:26-27</a>)<p>And by crucifying the flesh in Galatians:<p>Those who are Christ's crucify the flesh with its passions and desires. (<a href="3927/galatians_5_24.htm">Galatians 5:24</a>)</p><p>[3] The dead symbolize people who have afflicted their soul, crucified their flesh, and undergone temptations or trials, because by so doing they have ended their previous life and so become as though dead in the eyes of the world. For the Lord said,<p>Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain. (<a href="3927/john_12_24.htm">John 12:24</a>)<p>Nor are any others meant by the dead in John:<p>(Jesus said,) "as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them, even so the Son gives life to whom He will." (<a href="3927/john_5_21.htm">John 5:21</a>)<p>Also in John:<p>(Jesus said,) "the hour is coming..., when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and... live." (<a href="3927/john_5_25.htm">John 5:25</a>)<p>And also by the resurrection of the dead (<a href="3927/luke_14_14.htm">Luke 14:14</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_5.htm">Revelation 20:5</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">12-13</a>, and elsewhere). See no. <a href="106.htm">106</a> above.<p>And in the book of Psalms:<p>Precious in the sight of Jehovah is the death of His saints. (<a href="3927/psalms_116_15.htm">Psalms 116:15</a>)<p>Moreover Jesus said,<p>Whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. (<a href="3927/matthew_10_39.htm">Matthew 10:39</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_16_25.htm">16:25</a>, cf. <a href="3927/luke_9_24.htm">Luke 9:24-25</a>; <a href="3927/luke_17_33.htm">17:33</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_25.htm">John 12:25</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 639</h4><p>639. [verse 13] 'And I heard a voice out of heaven saying unto me, Write, blessed are the dead dying in the Lord from henceforth' signifies a prediction from the Lord concerning the state after death of those who will belong to His New Church (e Nova Ecclesia Ipsius erunt), which is that those who endure temptations on account of a faith directed to the Lord and a life in accordance with His precepts, have eternal life and happiness. By 'to hear a voice out of heaven saying' is signified a prediction from the Lord. It concerns the state after death of those who will belong to His New Church, because it treats of that state in this verse. By 'dying henceforth' is signified their state after death. 'Write' signifies so that it may be for a remembrance to posterity (<a href="39.htm">39</a>, <a href="63.htm">63</a>). By 'blessed' are signified those who have eternal life and happiness, since they are blessed. By 'the dead' are signified those who have afflicted their soul, crucified their flesh and endured temptations. That these are understood here by 'the dead' will be seen below.</p><p>[2] That those have eternal life and happiness who have endured temptations on account of a faith directed to the Lord and on account of a life in accordance with His precepts, is plain from the words just preceding where it is said 'Here <sup>1</sup>is the patience of the saints, here are those keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus,' by which is signified that the man of the New Church is examined by means of temptations in regard to his quality as to a life in accordance with the precepts [of the Decalogue] and as to a faith directed to the Lord. This may be seen just above (<a href="638.htm">638</a>), and by reason of the following words 'And they shall rest from their labours,' by which is signified that those who have been tempted are going to have peace in the Lord, concerning whom just below (<a href="640.htm">640</a>). By 'temptations' here are understood the spiritual temptations which take place (existunt) with those who have a faith directed to the Lord and live in accordance with His precepts, while they are driving away the evil spirits with them who act together with their lusts. These temptations are signified by 'the cross' in these passages:<p>Whoever does not take up his cross and follow after Me, is not worthy of Me. <a href="3927/matthew_10_38.htm">Matthew 10:38</a>.<p>Jesus said, If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, bear his cross, and follow Me. <a href="3927/matthew_16_24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>; <a href="3927/luke_9_23.htm">Luke 9:23-25</a>; <a href="3927/luke_14_26.htm">14:26-27</a>; also by 'the crucifixion of the flesh' in Paul:<p>They who are Christ's crucify the flesh with the passions and lusts, <a href="3927/galatians_5_24.htm">Galatians 5:24</a>.</p><p>[3] The reason why by 'the dead' are signified those who have afflicted their soul, crucified their flesh and endured temptations is because thereby they have mortified the former life, and consequently have become as it were dead before the world; for the Lord said:<p>Unless a grain of wheat falling on the land dies, it remains alone, but if it dies it bears much fruit. <a href="3927/john_12_24.htm">John 12:24</a>.<p>Nor are any others understood by 'the dead' in John:<p>Jesus said, As the Father raises up the dead and revives them, so does the Son revive whom He will. <a href="3927/john_5_21.htm">John 5:21</a>.<p>In the same:<p>Jesus said that the hour shall come when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and shall live. <a href="3927/john_5_25.htm">John 5:25</a>.<p>And also by 'the resurrection of the dead' (<a href="3927/luke_14_4.htm">Luke 14:4</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_5.htm">Revelation 20:5</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">12-13</a>; and elsewhere). See <a href="106.htm">106</a> above. Also in David:<p>Precious in the eyes of Jehovah is the death of His saints. <a href="3927/psalms_116_15.htm">Psalms 116:15</a>.<p>Jesus also said:<p>Whoever loses his soul for My sake, shall find it. <a href="3927/matthew_10_39.htm">Matthew 10:39</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_16_25.htm">16:25</a>; <a href="3927/luke_9_24.htm">Luke 9:24-25</a>; <a href="3927/luke_17_33.htm">17:33</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_25.htm">John 12:25</a>.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Reading Hic (here) instead of Haec (this). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 639</h4><p>639. Verse 13. And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Happy are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth, signifies a prediction from the Lord concerning the state of those after death who will be of His New Church, which is, that they who suffer temptations on account of faith in the Lord and life according to His precepts, will have eternal life and happiness. "To hear a voice from heaven saying," signifies a prediction from the Lord. The reason why it relates to their state after death who will be of His New Church, is, because that state is treated of in this verse; by "them that die henceforth," is signified their state after death; "write," signifies that it may be for a remembrance to posterity, (<a href="39.htm">39</a>, <a href="63.htm">63</a>). By "happy" are signified they who have eternal life and happiness, because they are happy. By "the dead" are signified they who afflicted their soul, crucified their flesh, and suffered temptations; that these are here meant by "the dead," will be seen below.</p><p>[2] That they have eternal life and happiness who have suffered temptations on account of their faith in the Lord and their life according to His commandments, appears from what goes before, where it is said, "Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus:" by which is signified that the man of the New Church is explored by temptations in regard to his quality as to a life according to the commandments, and as to faith in the Lord (see above, <a href="638.htm">638</a>); and from the following, "and that they may rest from their labors," by which is signified that they who are tempted will have peace in the Lord (as will be seen below, <a href="640.htm">640</a>). By "temptations" are here meant spiritual temptations, which exist with those who have faith in the Lord and live according to His commandments, when they drive away the evil spirits that are with them, who act as one with their lusts. These temptations are signified by "the cross" in the following passages:<p>And he that taketh not his cross and followeth after Me, is not worthy of Me, (<a href="3927/matthew_10_38.htm">Matthew 10:38</a>).<p>Jesus said, If anyone will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me, (<a href="3927/matthew_16_24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>; <a href="3927/luke_9_23.htm">Luke 9:23-25</a>; <a href="3927/luke_14_26.htm">14:26-27</a>).<p>Also by "crucifying the flesh" in Paul:<p>They that are Christ's crucify the flesh with the passions and lusts, (<a href="3927/galatians_5_24.htm">Galatians 5:24</a>).</p><p>[3] The reason why they are signified by "the dead" who have afflicted their soul, crucified their flesh, and suffered temptations, is, because thereby they have mortified their former life, and therefore are become as it were dead before the world; for the Lord says:<p>Except a grain of wheat falling on the earth die, it abideth alone, but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit, (<a href="3927/john_12_24.htm">John 12:24</a>).<p>Nor are any others meant by "the dead" in John:<p>Jesus said, As the Father raiseth up the dead, and vivifieth them, even so the Son vivifieth whom He will, (<a href="3927/john_5_21.htm">John 5:21</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Jesus said, The hour cometh, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and live, (<a href="3927/john_5_25.htm">John 5:25</a>).<p>And also by "the resurrection of the dead" (<a href="3927/luke_14_14.htm">Luke 14:14</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_20_5.htm">Revelation 20:5</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_20_12.htm">12-13</a>; and in other places; see above, (<a href="106.htm">106</a>), and in David:<p>Precious in the eyes of Jehovah is the death of His saints, (<a href="3927/psalms_116_15.htm">Psalms 116:15</a>).<p>Jesus also said, He that loseth his soul for My sake, shall find it, (<a href="3927/matthew_10_39.htm">Matthew 10:39</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_16_25.htm">16:25</a>; <a href="3927/luke_9_24.htm">Luke 9:24-25</a>; <a href="3927/luke_17_33.htm">17:33</a>; <a href="3927/john_12_25.htm">John 12:25</a>). </p>
