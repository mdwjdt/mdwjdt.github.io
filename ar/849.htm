<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第849节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>849.“他们与基督同生活、同作王一千年”表早已与主结合并在其国度中一段时间者。“与基督同生活”的人表示那些早已与主结合的人，因为他们是活着的。“与基督同作王”的人表示那些早已在祂国度中的人，如下文所述。“一千年”表示一段时间（<a href="842.htm">842</a>节）。这些话说的是那些在世时敬拜主，并照其圣言中的诫命生活的人，他们死后被保守，免得被龙们迷惑，因而在内在事物上早已与主结合，并与天上的天使相联有一段时间了。“与基督同作王”不是指与祂一起统治，而是凭与主的结合而在祂的国度中（参看<a href="284.htm">284</a>节）。因为唯有主作王，天上的每个人都具有某种功能，在自己的社群履行职责，和在世时一样，不过，是在主的引导下。事实上，天使凭自己行事；不过，他们首先关注功用，故通过主行事，因为一切功用皆来自主。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 849</h4><p>849. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. This symbolically means, who possessed a conjunction with the Lord already and had been in His kingdom for some time.<p>Those who lived with Christ symbolize people who possessed a conjunction with the Lord, because these have life. Those who reigned with Christ symbolize people who were in His kingdom, as explained below. That a thousand years symbolizes for some time may be seen in no. <a href="842.htm">842</a> above.<p>This declaration is said of people who in their life in the world worshiped the Lord and lived in accordance with His commandments in the Word. After death they were protected to keep dragon-spirits from leading them astray. Thus they were people who for some time had possessed a conjunction with the Lord already and were, in respect to their interiors, affiliated with angels in heaven.<p>That to reign with Christ does not mean to reign with Him, but to be in His kingdom by conjunction with Him, may be seen in no. <a href="284.htm">284</a> above. For the Lord alone reigns, and everyone in heaven engaged in some occupation performs some service in his society, as in the world. But he does so under the Lord's direction. Angels act, indeed, as though of themselves, but because they regard primarily the useful services they perform, they act from the Lord, from whom originates every useful endeavor. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 849</h4><p>849. 'And they lived and reigned with Christ for the thousand years' signifies who had already been in conjunction with the Lord and His kingdom for some time.<p>Those who 'lived with Christ' signify those who have been in conjunction with the Lord, because they are living. Those who 'reigned with Christ' signify those who have been in His kingdom, concerning which [something] follows. That by 'for the thousand years' is signified for some time may be seen above (<a href="842.htm">842</a>). These things were said of those who its their life in the world worshipped the Lord and lived in accordance with His precepts in the Word, and after deaths were guarded lest they should be led astray by the dragonists, thus who already for some time had been conjoined with the Lord and in association with the angels of heaven as to interior things. That 'to reign with the Lord is not to reign with Him but to be in His kingdom by conjunction with Him may be seen above (<a href="284.htm">284</a>). For Only the Lord reigns, and every one in heaven who is in any function performs a duty in his own society, just as in the world, but under the Lord's auspices. They indeed act from themselves, but because they have regard to uses in the first place they act from the Lord, from Whom is every use. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 849</h4><p>849. And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years, signifies who have been already for some time in conjunction with the Lord and in His kingdom. "Who lived with Christ," signifies who were in conjunction with the Lord, because these live. "Who reigned with Christ," signifies who were in His kingdom, of which presently; that by "a thousand years" is signified some time, may be seen above, (<a href="842.htm">842</a>). This is said of those who doing their life in the world worshiped the Lord, and lived according to His commandments in the Word, and after death were guarded lest they should be seduced by the dragonists, thus who had been already for some time conjoined with the Lord and consociated as to their interiors with the angels of heaven. That "to reign with the Lord" does not mean to reign with Him, but to be in His kingdom by conjunction with Him may be seen above, (<a href="284.htm">284</a>). For the Lord alone reigns, and everyone in heaven, who is in any function, performs his office in his society, as in the world, but under the auspices of the Lord; they act indeed as of themselves, but because they regard uses in the first place, they act from the Lord, from whom is all use. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 849 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>849. "Et vixerunt et regnaverunt cum Christo mille annos," significat qui jamdum in conjunctione cum Domino et in Regno Ipsius fuerunt aliquamdiu.- "Qui vixerunt cum Christo" significat qui in conjunctione cum Domino fuerunt, quia illi vivunt; "qui regnaverunt cum Christo" significat qui in Regno Ipsius fuerunt, de quo sequitur; quod per "mille annos" significetur aliquamdiu, videatur supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_849/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_842" target=_top>842</a>). Haec dicta sunt de illis qui in vita sua in mundo coluerunt Dominum, et secundum praecepta Ipsius in Verbo vixerunt, et post mortem custoditi sunt, ne a Draconicis seducerentur; ita qui jamdum aliquamdiu conjuncti fuerunt Domino, et consociati angelis Caeli quoad interiora. Quod "regnare cum Domino" non sit regnare cum Ipso, sed esse in Regno Ipsius per conjunctionem cum Ipso, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_849/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_284" target=_top>284</a>. Solus enim Dominus regnat, et quisque in Caelo, qui in functione est, in sua societate obit officium sicut in mundo, at sub auspicio Domini; agunt quidem sicut a se, sed quia usus spectant primario, agunt a Domino, a Quo est omnis usus. </p>
