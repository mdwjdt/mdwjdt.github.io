<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第470节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>470.“他右脚踏海，左脚踏地”表主将整个教会，以及其中那些处于教会外在的人和那些处于教会内在的人置于祂的看顾和统治之下。“海与地”表示整个教会；“海”表示外在教会，也就是那些处于教会外在的人；“地”表示内在教会，也就是那些处于教会内在的人（<a href="398.htm">398</a>节）。“脚踏它们”表示使所有人都服从祂自己，因而将他们轩于祂的神性看顾和统治之下。主在地上的教会在众天堂之下，故被称为祂的“脚凳”，如以下经文：</p><p>祂将以色列的华美从天扔在地上，并不记念自己的脚凳。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.1.htm">2:1</a>）</p><p>地是我的脚凳。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.1.htm">66:1</a>）</p><p>我们要进祂的居所，在祂脚凳前下拜。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗132.7.htm">132:7</a>）</p><p>不可指着天起誓，因为天是神的宝座，不可指着地起誓，因为地是祂的脚凳。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.34.htm">5:34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.35.htm">35</a>）</p><p>我要使我脚踏之地得荣耀。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.13.htm">60:13</a>）</p><p>你派祂管理你手所造的，使万物都服在祂的脚下。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗8.6.htm">8:6</a>）</p><p>这说的是主。之所以“右脚踏海”、“左脚踏地”，是因为那些处于教会外在的人不像那些处于教会内在的人那样如此自行确认虚假。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 470</h4><p>470. And he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land. This symbolically means that the Lord has the entire church under His auspices and governance, both those people in it who concern themselves with its external elements, and those in it who concern themselves with its internal ones.<p>The sea and land symbolize the entire church - the sea the external church, or those people who concern themselves with its external elements, and the land the internal church, or those people who concern themselves with its internal ones (no. <a href="398.htm">398</a>). To set His feet on them means, symbolically, to have all these subject to Him, thus to have them under His Divine auspices and governance.<p>Since the Lord's church on earth is beneath the heavens, therefore it is called His footstool, as in the following passages:<p>He cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel...; He does not remember His footstool... (<a href="3927/lamentations_2_1.htm">Lamentations 2:1</a>)<p>...the earth is My footstool. (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>)<p>Let us go into His tabernacle; let us worship at His footstool. (<a href="3927/psalms_132_7.htm">Psalms 132:7</a>)<p>...do not swear... by heaven, for it is God's throne; nor by the earth, for it is His footstool. (<a href="3927/matthew_5_34.htm">Matthew 5:34-35</a>)<p>I will make the place of My feet honorable. (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a>)<p>You have made Him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under His feet... (<a href="3927/psalms_8_6.htm">Psalms 8:6</a>)<p>These things are said of the Lord.<p>He placed His right foot on the sea and His left on the land because those people who concerned themselves with the external elements of the church did confirm falsities in themselves to the same extent as those who concerned themselves with its internal elements. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 470</h4><p>470. 'And he set his right foot upon the sea and the left one upon the land' signifies that the Lord has the entire Church under His auspices and dominion, as well the members who are in the external things thereof, as those who are in its internal things. By 'sea and land' the entire Church is signified; by 'the sea' the external Church, that is, those who are in the external things thereof; and by 'the land' the internal Church, that is, those who are in its internal things (<a href="398.htm">398</a>). By 'to set the feet upon them' is signified to have all things subject to Himself, consequently under His Divine auspices and dominion. Since the Lord's Church on earth (in terris) is beneath the heavens it is therefore called 'the footstool of His feet,' as in these places:<p>He has cast forth out of heaven onto the land the ornament of Israel, He remembers not the footstool of His feet, <a href="3927/lamentations_2_1.htm">Lamentations 2:1</a>.<p>The land is the footstool of My feet. <a href="3927/isaiah_66_1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>.<p>We will enter into His dwellings, we will bow ourselves down at the footstool of His feet. <a href="3927/psalms_132_7.htm">Psalms 132:7</a>.<p>Swear not by heaven, for it is God's throne, nor by the land, for it is the footstool of His feet. <a href="3927/matthew_5_34.htm">Matthew 5:34-35</a>.<p>I will render the place of My feet honourable. <a href="3927/isaiah_60_13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a>.<p>Thou hast made Him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands, Thou hast put all things under His feet. <a href="3927/psalms_8_6.htm">Psalms 8:6</a>; [H.B. <a href="3927/psalms_8_7.htm">7</a>].<p>These things [are said] of the Lord. That 'he set his right foot upon the sea, and the left one upon the land' is because those who are in the external things of the Church have not so confirmed the untruths with themselves as have those who are in its internal things. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 470</h4><p>470. And he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth, signifies that the Lord has the whole church, as well those therein who are in its externals, as those who are in its internals, under His auspices and dominion. By "the sea and the earth" is signified the entire church; by "the sea," the external church, that is, they who are in its externals; and by "the earth," the internal church, that is, they who are in its internals, (<a href="398.htm">398</a>). By "setting his feet upon them," is signified to hold all in subjection to Himself, consequently, under His Divine auspices and dominion. Since the Lord's church on earth is beneath the heavens, therefore it is called "the footstool of His feet," as in these passages:<p>He hath cast forth out of heaven unto the earth the ornament of Israel, He doth not remember the footstool of His feet, (<a href="3927/lamentations_2_1.htm">Lamentations 2:1</a>).<p>The earth is the footstool of My feet, (<a href="3927/isaiah_66_1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>).<p>We will enter into His habitations, we will bow ourselves down at the footstool of His feet, (<a href="3927/psalms_132_7.htm">Psalms 132:7</a>).<p>Thou shalt not swear by heaven, because it is the throne of God, neither by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet, (<a href="3927/matthew_5_34.htm">Matthew 5:34-35</a>).<p>I will make the place of My feet honorable, (<a href="3927/isaiah_60_13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a>).<p>Thou hast made Him to rule over the works of Thy hands, Thou hast put all things under His feet, (<a href="3927/psalms_8_6.htm">Psalms 8:6</a>).<p>This is said of the Lord. That "he put his right foot upon the sea and his left upon the earth" is because they who are in the externals of the church have not so confirmed falsities with themselves as those who are in its internals. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 470 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>470. "Et posuit pedem dextrum super mari et sinistrum super terra," significat quod Dominus sub Suo Auspicio et Dominio habeat universam Ecclesiam, tam illos ibi qui in externis ejus sunt, qua in illos ibi qui in internis ejus. - Per "mare et terram" significatur universa Ecclesia, per "mare" Ecclesia externa, hoc est, illi qui in externis ejus sunt, et per "terram" Ecclesia interna, hoc est, illi qui in internis ejus sunt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_470/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_398" target=_top>398</a>) per "ponere pedes super illis," significatur omnia Sibi subjecta habere, proinde sub Divino Suo Auspicio et Dominio. Quoniam Ecclesia Domini in terris est sub Caelis, ideo vocatur illa "scabellum pedum Ipsius," ut in his locis: <p>"Projecit e Caelo in terram decus Israelis, non recordatur Scabelli pedum Suorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_470/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_lamentations_2_1" target=_top>Threni 2:1</a>);<p>"Terra Scabellum pedum Meorum," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_470/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_66_1" target=_top>Esaias 66:1</a>);<p>"Intrabimus in Habitacula Ipsius, incurvabimus nos Scabello pedum Ipsius," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_470/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_132_7" target=_top>Psalm 132:7</a>); <sup>1</sup><p>"Non jurabis per Caelum, quia Thronus Dei est, neque per Terram, quia Scabellum pedum Ipsius," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_470/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_5_34-35" target=_top>Matthaeus 5:34-35</a>);<p>"Locum pedum Meorum honorabilem reddam," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_470/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_isaiah_60_13" target=_top>Esaias 60:13</a>);<p>"Dominari fecisti Ipsum super opera <sup>2</sup>manuum Tuarum, omnia posuisti sub Pedes Ipsius," (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_470/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_8_7" target=_top>Psalm 8:7</a> (B.A. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_470/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_8_6" target=_top>6</a>);<p>haec de Domino.
