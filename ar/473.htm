<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第473节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>473.启10:4.“七雷发声之后，我正要写出来，就听见从天上有声音对我说，七雷所说的事你要封上，不可写出来”表这些事虽已显明，但要等到龙、兽和假先知所表示的那些人被逐出灵人界之后，它们才被接受，因为在此之前被接受，就会有危险。七雷所发之“声”就是刚才所提到的那些事（<a href="472.htm">472</a>节），这些事提及三次，因为它们正是新教会的本质。就属世之义而言，“写出来”表示记在纸上，因而是给后人存留的信息；但就属灵之义而言，“写出来”表示为了接受而记在心上；因此，把它们“封上，不可写出来”表示它们不会被记在心上并接受，直到龙、兽和假先知所表示的那些人被逐出灵人界，因为它们在此之前被接受，就会有危险。原因在于，“龙”、“兽”和“假先知”表示那些陷入与仁分离之信的人，他们坚持不懈地执着于自己的信仰，即：要靠近父神，而不是直接靠近主；主就其人性而言，并非天地之神；因此，如果上述“小书卷展开”所表示的、已经显明并正在显明的教义（<a href="472.htm">472</a>节）是被其他任何人，而不是被那些处于仁及其信的人，也就是“约翰”所表示的那些人（<a href="5.htm">5</a>，<a href="17.htm">17</a>节）所接受，那么在龙被逐出之前，它不仅被他们弃绝，还会通过他们而被其他人弃绝；即便不被弃绝，也会遭到歪曲，甚至亵渎。</p><p>事实的确如此，这一点从启示录接下来的一系列内容很清楚地看出来，如：他们杀害主的两个见证人（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.7.htm">11:7</a>）；那龙站在即将生产的妇人面前，要吞吃她的孩子；他与米迦勒争战后，就逼迫那妇人（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.1.htm">12:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.17.htm">17</a>）；两个兽上来，一个从海中上来，另一个从地中上来，与龙合而为一（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.1.htm">13:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.18.htm">18</a>）；又如，他将其追随者聚集到叫哈米吉多顿的地方去争战（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.16.htm">16:16</a>）；最后，他们聚集列族，就是歌革和玛各去争战（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.8.htm">20:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.9.htm">9</a>）；不过，龙、兽和假先知都被扔进硫磺和火的湖里（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.10.htm">20:10</a>）；这一切完成后，将要作羔羊之妻的新教会从天而降（启示录21-22章）。这就是这句话的含义：</p><p>七雷所说的事你要封上，不可写出来。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启10.4.htm">10:4</a>）</p><p>也是本章下面这句话的含义：</p><p>在第七位天使发声的日子，神的奥秘就成全了，正如神向祂的仆人众先知所宣告的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启10.7.htm">10:7</a>）</p><p>还是下一章这句话的含义：</p><p>第七位天使吹号，天上就有大声音说，世上的国成了我们主的和主基督的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.15.htm">11:15</a>）</p><p>同样是接下来各章中许多话的含义。该主题的相关内容，可见于《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》（<a href="../lord/61.htm">61</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 473</h4><p>473. Now when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, "Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and do not write them." (<a href="3927/revelation_10_4.htm">10:4</a>) This symbolically means that these things must indeed be disclosed, but they are not accepted until after those people meant by the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet have been cast out of the world of spirits, because it would be dangerous before then.<p>The voices uttered by the seven thunders are declarations expressing what we have just said in no. <a href="472.htm">472</a> above. And because these constitute the essential doctrine of the New Church, they are mentioned three times.<p>In the natural sense, to write means to commit to paper and thus to record for posterity; but in the spiritual sense, to write means, symbolically, to commit to the heart for its acceptance. Sealing something up, therefore, and not writing it. This means, symbolically, not to commit it to the heart or accept it until after the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet have been cast out of the world of spirits, because it would be dangerous before then. That is because the dragon, beast and false prophet symbolize people caught up in a faith divorced from charity, and these cling steadfastly and tenaciously to their belief that one must go to God the Father and not to the Lord directly, and that the Lord is not God of heaven and earth as regards His humanity. Consequently, as regards the doctrine presented just above in no. 472, which was disclosed and continues to be disclosed, symbolized by the little book's being open - if, before the dragon was cast out, that doctrine were to be received by others than people possessing charity and its accompanying faith, who also are symbolized by John (nos. <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="17.htm">17</a>), it would be rejected not only by them, but through them by everyone else as well. And if not rejected, still it would be falsified, even profaned.</p><p>[2] The reality of this is clearly apparent from the following chapters in Revelation when viewed in their sequence, in which we are told that they killed the Lord's two witnesses (chapter 11); that the dragon stood before the woman ready to give birth, to devour her child, and that after it fought with Michael, it pursued the woman (chapter 12); that the two beasts, one rising up from the sea and one from the earth, made common cause with him (chapter 13); that they gathered their followers together to do battle at a place called Armageddon (chapter 16); and finally that they gathered the nations Gog and Magog to do battle (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_20_1.htm">20</a>, verses <a href="3927/revelation_20_8.htm">8-9</a>); but that the dragon, beast and false prophet were cast into the lake of fire and brimstone (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_20_1.htm">20</a>, verse <a href="3927/revelation_20_10.htm">10</a>); and that after this took place, the New Church, which was to be the Lamb's bride, came down out of heaven (chapters <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_22_1.htm">22</a>).<p>These are the things meant by the charge, "Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and do not write them." Also by the subsequent statement in this chapter, that "in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel..., the mystery of God would be concluded, as He declared to His servants the prophets" (verse 7). So, too, by this statement in the next chapter, "Then the seventh angel sounded: and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, 'The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ,'" (chapter <a href="3927/revelation_11_1.htm">11</a>:, verse <a href="3927/revelation_11_15.htm">15</a>). And further, by a number of similar statements in the following chapters.<p>On this subject, something may be seen in , . </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 473</h4><p>473. [verse 4] 'And when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was going to write, and I heard a voice out of heaven saying unto me, Seal up the things that the seven thunders have uttered, and write them not' signifies that these things are indeed made manifest, but that they are not received until after those who are understood by the dragon, the beast and the false prophet have been cast out of the world of spirits, because of the danger if [they were received] before. The 'voices' that the seven thunders uttered are the things of which [we have written] just above (<a href="472.htm">472</a>), and these [thunderings] are mentioned three times because they are the very essentials of the New Church. By 'to write' in the natural sense is signified to commit to paper, and thus to posterity in recorded form, but in the spiritual sense by 'to write' is signified to commit to the heart for reception. Consequently by 'to seal up' and 'to write them not' is signified that they are not committed to the heart and received until after the dragon, the beast and the false prophet have been cast out of the world of spirits, because of the danger if [they were received] before. This is because by 'the dragon, the beast and the false prophet' are signified those who are in a faith separated from charity, and these constantly and tenaciously cling to their faith that God the Father is to be approached and not the Lord directly, also that the Lord is not the God of heaven and earth as to His Human. Therefore, if the Doctrine mentioned just above (<a href="472.htm">472</a>), which has been and is still being made manifest-and this is signified by the little book's having been 'opened'-were received by others than those who are in charity and the faith thereof, who indeed are those who are signified by 'John' (<a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="17.htm">17</a>), before the dragon has been cast out, it would be rejected not only by them but also through them by the rest; and if not rejected, it would still be falsified, even profaned.</p><p>[2] That this is the case is quite plain from the things now following in the Apocalypse seen in a series. These are:<p>That they killed the Lord's two witnesses chapter <a href="3927/revelation_11_1.htm">11</a>.<p>That the dragon stood close by the woman going to bring forth so that he might devour her offspring, and after he had fought with Michael he kept on pursuing the woman chapter <a href="3927/revelation_12_1.htm">12</a>.<p>And that the two beasts, the one coming up out of the sea and the other out of the land, made one with him chapter <a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">13</a>.<p>Then that he gathered his followers together for battle at the place termed Armageddon chapter <a href="3927/revelation_16_1.htm">16</a>.<p>And finally that they assembled the nations, Gog and Magog, to battle chapter <a href="3927/revelation_20_8.htm">20:8-9</a>.<p>But that the dragon, the beast and the false prophet were cast into the lake of fire and sulphur chapter <a href="3927/revelation_20_10.htm">20:10</a>.<p>And when this had been done, the New Church, which is going to be the Lamb's wife, came down out of heaven chapters <a href="3927/revelation_21_1.htm">21</a>; <a href="3927/revelation_22_1.htm">22</a>.<p>These are the things that are understood by the words 'Seal up the things that the seven thunders have uttered, and write them not'; also by these in this chapter:<p>In the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God shall be accomplished as He has proclaimed to His servants the prophets verse 7; as also by these in the following chapter:<p>And the seventh angel sounded, and great voices were produced in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world have become our Lord's and His Christ's verse 15; as well as by many similar statements in the chapters that follow. Something on this subject may be seen in <a href="../lord/61.htm">THE DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD 61</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 473</h4><p>473. Verse 4. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not, signifies that these things indeed are made manifest, but that they are not received till after they who are meant by "the dragon," "the beast," and "the false prophet," are cast out of the world of spirits, because there would be danger were they to be received before. "The voices" which the seven thunders uttered, are the things just mentioned above, (<a href="472.htm">472</a>), which are three times mentioned, because they are the very essentials of the New Church. By "writing," in the natural sense, is signified to commit to paper, and thus for the information of posterity, but, in the spiritual sense, by "writing" is signified to commit to the heart for reception; hence by "sealing them up and not writing them," is signified that they will not be committed to the heart and received, till after the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet, are cast out of the world of spirits, because there would be danger if they were received before. The reason is, because by "the dragon," "the beast," and "the false prophet," are signified they who are in faith separated from charity, and these constantly and tenaciously adhere to their belief, that God the Father is to be approached, and not the Lord immediately, and that the Lord is not the God of heaven and earth as to His Human; therefore if the above-mentioned doctrine, (<a href="472.htm">472</a>), which has been manifested and is still being manifested, which is signified by "the little book was opened," were to be received by any others than those who are in charity and its faith, who also are those who are signified by "John" (<a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="17.htm">17</a>), before the dragon is cast out, it would be rejected not only by them, but also through them, by the rest; and if not rejected, still it would be falsified, yea, profaned.</p><p>[2] That this is the case, evidently appears from what now follows in Revelation, when seen in its series, as, that they killed the Lord's two witnesses, (<a href="3927/revelation_11_7.htm">Rev 11:7</a>); that the dragon stood by the woman who was about to be delivered, that he might devour her offspring; and after he had fought with Michael he persecuted the woman, (<a href="3927/revelation_12_1.htm">Rev 12:1-17</a>); and that the two beasts which came up, one out of the sea, and the other out of the earth, made one with him, (<a href="3927/revelation_13_1.htm">Rev 13:1-18</a>); as also that he gathered together his followers to battle at the place called Armageddon, (<a href="3927/revelation_16_16.htm">Rev 16:16</a>); and, finally, that they assembled the nations, Gog and Magog, to war, (<a href="3927/revelation_20_8.htm">Rev 20:8-9</a>). But that the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet, were cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, (<a href="3927/revelation_20_10.htm">Rev 20:10</a>); and this being effected, the New Church, which is to be the Lamb's wife, came down out of heaven (Revelation 21-22). Such is the signification of these words:<p>Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not, (<a href="3927/revelation_10_5.htm">Rev 10:5-6</a>).<p>Also of the following in this chapter:<p>In the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God will be finished, as He hath declared to His servants the prophets, (<a href="3927/revelation_10_7.htm">Revelation 10:7</a>).<p>And by these words in the next chapter:<p>And the seventh angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world are become our Lord's and His Christ's, (<a href="3927/revelation_11_15.htm">Rev 11:15</a>).<p>And likewise by many things to the same effect in the chapters which follow. Something may be seen on this subject in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. . 61). </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 473 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>473. (Vers. 4.) "Et cum locuta sunt septem tonitrua voces suas, futurus sum scribere, et audivi vocem e Caelo dicentem mihi, Obsigna quae locuta sunt septem tonitrua, et ne illa scribas" significat quod illa quidem manifestentur, sed quod non recipiantur quam postquam illi, qui per "Draconem," "Bestiam," et "Pseudoprophetam" intelliguntur, e Mundo spirituum ejecti sunt, quia periculum si prius. - "Voces" quas locuta sunt septem tonitrua, sunt illa de quibus nunc supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_473/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_472" target=_top>472</a>), quae quia ipsa Essentialia Novae Ecclesiae sunt, ter dicuntur: per "scribere" in Sensu naturali significatur mandare chartae, et Sic posteritati in recordationem, sed in Sensu spirituali per "scribere" significatur mandare cordi ad receptionem inde per "obsignare et non scribere illa" significatur quod non mandentur cordi et recipiantur, quam postquam Draco, Bestia et Pseudopropheta e Mundo Spirituum ejecti sunt, quia periculum si prius; causa est, quia per "Draconem, Bestiam et Pseudoprophetam," significantur illi qui in fide separata a charitate sunt, et hi constanter et tenaciter haerent in fide sua, quod Deus Pater adeundus sit, et non Dominus immediate, tum quod Dominus non sit Deus Caeli et Terrae quoad Humanum suum; quare si Doctrina illa, de qua mox supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_473/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_472" target=_top>472</a>), quod manifestata est et adhuc manifestatur (quod significatur per quod "Libellus apertus fuerit"), reciperetur ab aliis quam qui in charitate et ejus fide sunt (qui etiam sunt qui per "Johannem" significantur <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_473/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_5" target=_top>5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_473/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_17" target=_top>17</a>), antequam Draco ejectus est, illa rejiceretur non modo ab illis, sed etiam per illos a reliquis; et si non rejiceretur, usque falsificaretur, imo prophanaretur. Quod ita sit, manifeste patet a nunc sequentibus in Apocalypsi in serie visis, quae sunt, quod occiderint binos Domini Testes, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_473/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_11_1-19" target=_top>11</a>); quod Draco steterit juxta Mulierem parituram ut devoraret faetum ejus, et postquam pugnaverat cum Michaele, persecutus sit Mulierem illam, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_473/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_12_1-18" target=_top>12</a>); quodque binae Bestiae, una e mari et altera e terra ascendentes, unum fecerint cum illo, (xiii.); tum quod in bellum congregaverint suos ad locum dictum Armageddon, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_473/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_16_1-21" target=_top>16</a>); et ultimo quod in bellum convocaverint gentes, Gogum et Magogum, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_473/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_8-9" target=_top>20:8-9</a>); at quod Draco, Bestia et Pseudopropheta conjecti sint in stagnum ignis et sulphuris, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_473/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_20_10" target=_top>20:10</a>); quibus factis, Nova Ecclesia, quae futura est Uxor Agni, descendit e Caelo, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_473/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_1-27" target=_top>21</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_473/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_22_1-21" target=_top>22</a>).
