<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第533节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>533.“有一个妇人，身披日头，脚踏月亮”表主在天上的新教会，也就是新天堂，以及即将在地上的新教会，也就是新耶路撒冷。主的新教会以这个“妇人”来表示，这一点从本章的细节明显可知，不过，这些细节当以灵义来理解；在圣言的其它部分，“妇人”也表示教会（参看<a href="434.htm">434</a>节）；“妇人”之所以表示教会，是因为教会被称为主的新娘或新妇与妻子。妇人被看到“身披日头”的原因在于，教会处于对主之爱，因为教会承认祂，并遵行祂的诫命，这就是爱祂（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.21.htm">14:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.24.htm">24</a>）。“日头”表示爱（参看<a href="53.htm">53</a>节）。“月亮”被看到在那妇人的脚下，是因为它表示地上尚未与天上教会结合的教会。“月亮”表示属世人里面的聪明和信仰（<a href="413.htm">413</a>节）；看上去在“脚下”表示教会即将在地上；否则，“脚”就表示与天上教会结合的这教会本身。</p><p>要知道，诸天和地上一样，也有一个教会，因为那里也有圣言；还有圣殿，其中也有讲道，那里还有事奉和祭司的职份。因为那里的所有天使都曾是世人，他们的离世不过是其生命的延续而已；因此，他们各自照着自己离世时所带来的对真理与良善的情感程度而在爱与智慧上日益完善。他们当中的教会在此由“身披日头、头戴十二星的冠冕的妇人”所表示的教会；但由于若非地上也有一个处于和谐的爱与智慧中的教会，天上的教会就无法持续存在，并且由于这教会即将到来，所以会看到“月亮在妇人脚下”，“月亮”在此尤其表示信，通过像现在这样的信是没有结合的。</p><p>若非地上的教会与天上的教会结合，天上的教会就无法持续存在。原因在于，天使所在的天堂和世人所在的教会行如一体，就像人的内在与外在；人的内在无法以自己的状态持续存在，除非外在与内在结合。因为没有外在的内在就像没有地基的房屋，或像在土表而非土里的种子，因而像某种无根之物；总而言之，就像一个原因没有一个得以存在于其中的结果。由此可见，世上某个地方当有一个教会，那里有圣言，主通过圣言为人所知，是绝对必要的。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 533</h4><p>533. A woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet. This symbolizes the Lord's New Church in heaven, which is the New Heaven, and the New Church to come on earth, which is the New Jerusalem.<p>That the woman here symbolizes the Lord's New Church is clear from the particulars in this chapter, understood in their spiritual meaning. To be shown that a woman elsewhere in the Word also symbolizes the church, see no. <a href="434.htm">434</a>. A woman symbolizes the church because the church is called the Lord's bride and wife.<p>The woman here appeared clothed with the sun because the church is governed by love toward the Lord; for it acknowledges Him and keeps His commandments, and that is loving Him (<a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>). That the sun symbolizes love may be seen in no. <a href="53.htm">53</a>.<p>The moon appeared under the woman's feet because it means the church on earth, which was not yet conjoined with the church in heaven. The moon symbolizes the intelligence in a natural person, and faith (no. <a href="413.htm">413</a>). And its being seen under the woman's feet means, symbolically, that it was a church to come on earth. Feet otherwise symbolize that same church after it has been conjoined.</p><p>[2] It should be known that the church exists in heaven just as on earth. For the Word is found there, and churches, and the preaching of sermons in them. Clerical and priestly orders exist there. For all the angels there were once people, and their departure from the world was for them but a continuation of life. Consequently they are perfected in love and wisdom, each one according to the degree of the affection for truth and goodness that he brought with him from the world.<p>The church among these is the church meant by the woman clothed with the sun, having on her head a crown of twelve stars. But because the church in heaven does not continue in existence unless there is also a church on earth that possesses an accordant love and wisdom, and this was yet to come, therefore the moon was seen under the woman's feet, which in particular here symbolizes faith, a faith which, as it exists today, is not a means of conjunction.</p><p>[3] The church in heaven does not continue in existence unless it is conjoined with a church on earth, because heaven where angels are, and the church where people are, function together, like the internal and external components in a person; and the internal component in a person does not continue in its proper condition unless the external component is joined to it. For the internal component without the external one is like a house without a foundation, or like seed on top of the ground and not in the ground, thus like something without a root - in a word, like a cause without an effect in which to abide.<p>It can be seen from this that it is an absolute necessity that a church exist somewhere in the world which has the Word and where the Lord is consequently known. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 533</h4><p>533. 'A woman encompassed with the sun, and the moon under her feet' signifies the Lord's New Church in the heavens, which is the New Heaven, and the Lord's New Church about to exist on earth, which is the New Jerusalem. That the Lord's New Church is signified by this 'woman' is established from the several things (ex singulis) in this chapter understood in the spiritual sense. It may be seen that by 'a woman' the Church is also signified elsewhere in the Word (<a href="434.htm">434</a>); and the Church is signified because the Church is called the Bride and Wife of the Lord. She was seen 'encompassed with the sun' because the Church is in love directed to the Lord, for it acknowledges Him and does His commandments, which is to love Him (<a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>). That 'the sun' signifies love may be seen (<a href="53.htm">53</a>). 'The moon' was seen 'under the woman's feet' because the Church on earth (in terris) that has not yet been conjoined to the Church in the heavens is understood. By 'the moon' is understood intelligence in the natural man and faith (<a href="413.htm">413</a>); and by being seen 'under the feet' is signified that it is about to exist on earths; otherwise by 'the feet' is signified that Church itself, when it has been conjoined.</p><p>[2] It should be known that there is a Church in the heavens as well as on earth, for the Word is there, temples are there, and in them preaching, and there are ministries and priesthoods there. For there all the angels have been men, and their departure out of the world was to them only a continuation of life. Therefore also they are being perfected in love and wisdom, each in accordance with the degree of affection of truth and good that they have taken with them out of the world. The Church with them is understood here by the 'woman encompassed with the sun,' upon whose head was 'a crown of twelve stars.' Because, however, the Church in the heavens does not continue in existence unless there is also a Church on earth which is in concordant love and wisdom, and this is about to exist, therefore 'the moon' was seen 'under the woman's feet.' By this is here specifically signified the faith through which, as at present, there is no conjunction.</p><p>[3] The reason why the Church in the heavens does not continue in existence unless the Church on earth has been conjoined to it is because heaven where angels are and the Church where men are act as one, just as the internal and external with a man; and the internal with a man does not continue to exist in its own state unless the external is conjoined to it. For the internal without the external is like a house without a foundation, or like a seed on top of the ground and not in the ground, thus like something without a root, in a word, like a cause without an effect in which it may exist. From these considerations it can be seen that there is an absolute necessity that somewhere in the world there should be a Church, where the Word is, through which the Lord is known. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 533</h4><p>533. A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, signifies the Lord's New Church in the heavens, which is the New Heaven, and the Lord's New Church about to be upon earth, which is the New Jerusalem. That the Lord's New Church is signified by this "woman," is evident from the particulars in this chapter understood in the spiritual sense; that by "a woman," in other parts of the Word also, the church is signified, may be seen, (<a href="434.htm">434</a>); and the church is signified, because the church is called the Bride and Wife of the Lord. The reason why she was seen "clothed with the sun," is because the church is in love to the Lord, for it acknowledges Him and does His commandments, and this is to love Him, (<a href="3927/john_14_21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>). That "the sun" signifies love (see <a href="53.htm">53</a>). The reason why "the moon" was seen under the woman's feet is because the church on earth, which is not yet conjoined with the church in the heavens, is meant. By "the moon" is signified intelligence in the natural man, and faith, (<a href="423.htm">423</a>); and by being seen "under the feet," is signified that it is about to be upon earth; otherwise by "feet" is signified the church itself when it is conjoined.</p><p>[2] It is to be known, that there is a church in the heavens as well as on earth, for there also is the Word; there are temples also, and preachings in them, and there are ministerial and priestly offices. For all angels there were men, and their departure out of the world was only a continuation of their life; therefore they are also perfected in love and wisdom, everyone according to the degree of the affection of truth and good which he took with him out of the world. The church among them is here meant by "the woman clothed with the sun," who had upon her head a crown of twelve stars;" but because the church in the heavens cannot subsist, except there be also a church on earth, which is in concordant love and wisdom, and as this was about to be, therefore "the moon was seen under the feet of the woman," which here specifically signifies faith, by which, such as it is at this day, there is no conjunction.</p><p>[3] The reason why the church cannot subsist in the heavens unless there is a church on earth in conjunction with it, is because heaven where angels are, and the church where men are, act as one, like the internal and the external with man; and the internal with man cannot subsist with its state, unless an external be conjoined with it; for an internal without an external is like a house without a foundation, or like seed upon the ground and not in the ground, thus like anything without a root; in a word, like a cause without an effect in which it may exist. From these things, it may be seen how absolutely necessary it is that there should be a church somewhere in the world, where the Word is, and where by it the Lord is known. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypsis Revelata 533 (original Latin 1766)</h4><p>533. "Mulier circumdata Sole et Luna sub pedibus ejus," significat Nam Ecclesiam Domini in Caelis, quae est Novum Caelum, et Novam Ecclesiam Domini futuram in Terris, quae est Nova Hierosolyma. - Quod Nova Ecclesia Domini per "Mulierem" hanc significetur, constat ex singulis in hoc capite in Sensu spirituali intellectis; quod per "Mulierem" etiam alibi in Verbo significetur Ecclesia, videatur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_533/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_434" target=_top>434</a>); et significatur Ecclesia, quia Ecclesia vocatur Sponsa et Uxor Domini per quod visa sit "circumdata Sole," est quia in amore in Dominum est; agnoscit enim Ipsum, et facit praecepta Ipsius, et hoc est amare Ipsum, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_533/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_14_21-24" target=_top>Johannes 14:21-24</a>); quod "Sol" significet amorem, videatur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_533/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_53" target=_top>53</a>); quod "Luna" visa sit sub pedibus Mulieris, est quia Ecclesia in terris, quae nondum conjuncta est Ecclesiae in Caelis, intelligitur; per "Lunam" significatur intelligentia in naturali homine et fides (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_533/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_413" target=_top>413</a>); <sup>1</sup>et per videri "sub pedibus" significatur quod futura in terris; alioquin, per "pedes" significatur ipsa illa Ecclesia, dum conjuncta est. <p>Sciendum est, quod in Caelis aeque sit Ecclesia ac in terris, est enim ibi Verbum, sunt ibi templa, et in illis praedicationes, sunt ibi ministeria et sarcerdotia; omnes enim angeli ibi fuerunt homines, et ibi obitus illorum e mundo fuit illis modo continuatio vitae; quare etiam perficiuntur amore et sapientia, quisque secundum gradum affectionis veri et boni quem secum e mundo tulerunt. Ecclesia apud illos intelligitur hic per "Mulierem circumdatam Sole," et cui "super capite erat corona stellarum duodecim;" at quia Ecclesia in Caelis non subsistit, nisi etiam Ecclesia in terris sit, quae in concorde amore et sapientia sit, et haec futura est, ideo "visa est sub pedibus Mulieris luna," per quam hic in specie significatur fides, per quam, qualis est hodie, non datur conjunctio. Quod non subsistat Ecclesia in Caelis, nisi ei conjuncta sit Ecclesia in terris, est quia Caelum ubi angeli, et Ecclesia ubi homines, unum agunt, sicut internum et externum apud hominem, ac internum apud hominem in suo statu non subsistit nisi externum ei conjungatur; internum enim absque externo est sicut domus absque fundamento, aut sicut semen supra humum et non in humo, ita sicut aliquid absque radice, verbo, sicut causa absque effectu in quo sit: ex his videri potest, quod absoluta necessitas sit, ut in mundo alicubi sit Ecclesia, ubi Verbum est, et per id Dominus notus est.<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;413 pro "423" </p>
