<h3 align="center" class="ired">《揭秘启示录》 第760节</h3>
<h4 align="center">（本 2019）</h4>
<p>760.启18:4.“我又听见从天上有声音说，我的民哪，你们要从那城出来，免得在她的罪上有分，受她所受的灾殃”表主对所有人的劝诫，无论在天主教的，还是不在天主教的，要谨防通过承认和情感而与它结合，免得自己的灵魂与其可憎之物发生联结，从而灭亡。“又听见从天上有声音说”表示主对所有人的劝诫，无论在天主教的，还是不在天主教的，因为接下来经上说：“我的民要从那城出来”，也就是凡靠近主的人。这劝诫来自主，因为这声音是“从天上”来的。“免得在她的罪上有分”表示免得自己的灵魂与其可憎之物发生联结；还因为联结是通过承认和情感产生的，故也表示这一点。他们的“罪”之所以是可憎之物，是因为他们在前一章（｛17:4）就是如此被称呼的。“免得受她所受的灾”表示免得自己灭亡，因为“灾”表示邪恶与虚假，同时表示因他们的手段而灭亡。这些就由“灾”来表示，如前所述（<a href="657.htm">657</a>，<a href="673.htm">673</a>，<a href="676.htm">676</a>节等）。在以下圣言经文中，类似的话论及巴比伦：</p><p>我的民哪，你们要从巴比伦中间出去，各人拯救自己的灵魂，躲避耶和华忿怒的烈火，你们不要心惊胆怯，也不要风声惧怕。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.45.htm">51:45</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.46.htm">46</a>）</p><p>你们要从巴比伦中逃奔，各救自己的性命（或灵魂），不要因她的罪孽被剪除。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 51.6.htm"> 51:6</a>）</p><p>离开巴比伦吧，我们各人归回本地，因为她受的审判直达诸天，上到云霄。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶 51.9.htm"> 51:9</a>）</p><p>你们要从巴比伦出来，从迦勒底人中逃脱，用欢呼的声音宣告，将这事说给人听；你们要将这事宣扬到地极；说，耶和华救赎了。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 48.20.htm"> 48:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛 48.21.htm">21</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.8.htm">50:8</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Rogers translation 2007) 760</h4><p>760. <a href="3927/revelation_18_4.htm">18:4</a> And I heard another voice from heaven saying, "Come out of her, my peoples, lest you participate in her sins, and lest you become recipients of her plagues." This symbolizes an exhortation from the Lord to all people, both to those caught up in the Roman Catholic religion and to those not caught up in it, to beware of embracing it in acknowledgement and affection, lest they embrace its abominations with their souls and perish.<p>"Another voice from heaven saying" symbolizes an exhortation from the Lord to all people, both to those caught up in the Roman Catholic religion and to those not caught up in it, because the exhortation follows, "Come out of her, my peoples," which is to say, come out all who turn to the Lord. The exhortation comes from the Lord because the voice was a voice from heaven. "Lest you participate in her sins" means, symbolically, to beware of embracing its abominations with their souls; and because the embrace takes place through acknowledgment and affection, therefore this, too, is symbolically meant. Their sins are abominations, because that is what they are called in the preceding chapter, verse <a href="3927/revelation_17_4.htm">4</a>. "Lest you become recipients of her plagues" means, symbolically, lest they perish; for plagues symbolize evils and falsities, and at the same time destruction in consequence of them. This is the symbolic meaning of plagues in nos. <a href="657.htm">657</a>, <a href="673.htm">673</a>, <a href="676.htm">676</a> above, and elsewhere.<p>Similar things are said in connection with Babylon in the Word in the following places:<p>Come out of the midst of her, My people! Deliver everyone his soul because of the fierce anger of Jehovah, lest your heart weaken and you become fearful on account of the report... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_45.htm">Jeremiah 51:45-46</a>)<p>Flee from the midst of Babylon, and deliver everyone his soul, lest you be cut off on account of her iniquity... (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_6.htm">Jeremiah 51:6</a>)<p>Forsake (Babylon), and let us go everyone to his own country; for her judgment has reached to heaven and has risen up to the clouds. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_51_9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a>)<p>Go forth from Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans with the sound of singing! Proclaim this and cause it to be heard, utter it to the end of the earth: say, "Jehovah has redeemed...." (<a href="3927/isaiah_48_20.htm">Isaiah 48:20-21</a>; cf. <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_8.htm">Jeremiah 50:8</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Coulson translation 1970) 760</h4><p>760. [verse 4] 'And I heard another voice out of heaven saying, Come out of her, my people, lest you become partakers of her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues' signifies an exhortation from the Lord to all, both those who are in that form of religion and those who are not, to beware of conjunction therewith through acknowledgment and affection, lest as to their souls they be conjoined with its abominations and perish. By 'another voice out of heaven saying' is signified an exhortation from the Lord to all, both those who are in that form of religion and those who are not, because it follows on, 'Come out of her my people,' that is, all who approach the Lord. The exhortation is from the Lord because the voice was 'out of heaven.' By 'lest you become partakers of her sins' is signified to beware lest as to their souls they be conjoined with its abominations and because conjunction is effected through acknowledgment and affection, this also is signified. The reason why their 'sins' are abominations is because they are so called in the preceding chapter (verse 4). By 'lest you receive of her plagues' is signified lest they perish, for by 'plagues' are signified evils and untruths, and at the same time destruction by their means. These were signified by the 'plagues' above (<a href="657.htm">657</a>, <a href="673.htm">673</a>, <a href="676.htm">676</a>) and elsewhere. Similar things are said of Babel in the Word in these passages:<p>Go out of the midst of Babel, O my people, deliver every one his soul from the growing anger of the wrath of Jehovah, lest your heart become soft and you be afraid of the rumour. <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_45.htm">Jeremiah 51:45-46</a>.<p>Flee out of the midst of Babel, and deliver every one his soul, lest you be cut off for her iniquity. <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_6.htm">Jeremiah 51:6</a>.<p>Forsake Babel, and let us go up every one into his own land, for her judgment has reached to the heavens, and has lifted itself up even to the clouds. <a href="3927/jeremiah_51_9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a>.<p>Go out of Babel, flee from the Chaldean with the voice of singing; declare this and make it to be heard, utter this even to the extremity of the land, say Jehovah has redeemed. <a href="3927/isaiah_48_20.htm">Isaiah 48:20-21</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_50_8.htm">Jeremiah 50:8</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Apocalypse Revealed (Whitehead translation 1928) 760</h4><p>760. Verse 4. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye may become not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues, signifies exhortation from the Lord to all, as well those who are in that religious persuasion as those who are not in it, to guard themselves from conjunction with it by acknowledgment and affection, lest as to their souls they should be conjoined with its abominations, and should perish. By "another voice from heaven saying," is signified exhortation from the Lord to all, as well those who are in that religious persuasion as those who are not in it; because it follows, "Come out of her, my people," that is, all who approach the Lord. This exhortation is from the Lord, because the voice was "from heaven." By "that ye become not partakers of her sins," is signified that they should beware lest as to their souls they should be conjoined with its abominations; and as conjunction is effected by acknowledgment and affection, this also is signified. Their sins are abominations, because they are so called in the preceding chapter, (<a href="3927/revelation_17_4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>). By "that ye receive not of her plagues," is signified lest they perish; for by "plagues" evils and falsities are signified, and at the same time destruction by them. These are signified by "the plagues" above, (<a href="657.htm">657</a>, <a href="673.htm">673</a>, <a href="676.htm">676</a>, and elsewhere).

"Et audivi aliam vocem e Caelo, dicentem, Exite ex illa, populi Mei, ne participes fiatis peccatorum ejus, et ne recipiatis ex plagis ejus," significat a Domino exhortationem ad omnes, tam qui in illo Religioso sunt, quam qui in illo non sunt, ut caveant sibi a conjunctione cum illo per agnitionem et affectionem, ne quoad animas conjungantur abominationibus ejus, et pereant. -Per "aliam vocem e Caelo, dicentem," significatur a Domino exhortatio ad omnes, tam qui in illo Religioso sunt, quam qui in illo non sunt, quia sequitur, "Exite ex illa, populi Mei, "hoc est, omnes qui adeunt Dominum; quod a Domino sit illa exhortatio, est quia vox illa fuit "e Caelo;" per "ne participes fiatis peccatorum ejus," significatur ut caveant sibi ne quoad animas conjungantur abominationibus ejus; et quia conjunctio fit per agnitionem et affectionem, etiam hoc significatur; quod peccata eorum sint abominationes, est quia ita vocantur in capite praecedente (vers. 4); per "ne recipiatis ex plagis ejus" significatur ne pereant, per "plagas" enim significantur mala et falsa, et simul interitus per illas; haec significata sunt per "plagas" supra (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_760/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_657" target=_top>657</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_760/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_673" target=_top>673</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_760/swedenborg_apocalypsis-revelata_676" target=_top>676</a>, et alibi).
