<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">十、自由</h4 ><p>141、一切自由皆属于爱，因为凡人所爱的，他都会自由地去行。因此，一切自由也都属于意愿，因为凡人所爱的，他也会去意愿。由于爱和意愿构成人的生命，所以自由也构成人的生命。由此明显可知自由是什么，即：它是属于爱和意愿，因而属于人生命的东西。这就是为何人自由所行的，在他看来似乎来自他自己。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第十章　自由</h4><p>141、一切自由属于爱，因为无论人爱什么，他就自由自在的去做。因为人所爱的，他也愿意去做。因为爱和意志构成人的生命，所以自由也构成人的生命。 从此可以看出自由是什么，它是人的爱和意志，也就是人的生命的彰显。所以，人自由地去做的任何事，他都觉得是发自他的内心。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 141</h4><p>141. Freedom<p>ALL freedom is a function of love, because what we love we do with a sense of freedom. Therefore all of our freedom is connected with our will, because whatever we love we also will to do; and since our love and our will constitute our life, freedom too constitutes our life. This can show us what freedom is, namely, that it is a reflection of our love and our will and therefore our life. That is why anything we do freely seems to us to have come from ourselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 141</h4><p>141. Chapter 10. Freedom<p>All freedom comes from love, since whatever we love, we do freely. All freedom also comes from our motivation, since we want to do whatever we love. Since love and motivation make up our life, freedom also makes up our life. So you can see what freedom is: it is what makes up our love and our motivation, and the life we have from these two things. Because of this, whatever we do in freedom, we feel that we are doing on our own. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 141</h4><p>141. X. ON FREEDOM <p>All freedom is a matter of loving, for what a person loves, that he does freely. Consequently all freedom is a matter of the will, for what a person loves that he also wills. And because loving and willing make a person's life, so too does freedom. From this it can be established what freedom is, namely a matter of loving and willing, and so a matter of how a person lives. That is why what a person does by free choice seems to him as if it were done of his own self. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 141</h4><p>141. FREEDOM. <p>ALL freedom belongs to love; for what a man loves he does freely. Hence also all freedom belongs to the will - for what a man loves he also wills; and since love and will constitute a man's life, so also does freedom. From this it may appear what freedom is, namely, that it is what belongs to the love and the will, and hence to the life of a man; from whence it is that what a man does from freedom appears to him as though it came from Self. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 141</h4><p>141. X. FREEDOM.<p>All freedom is of love, for what man loves, this he does freely; hence also all freedom is of the will, for what man loves, this he also wills; and because love and the will make the life of man, so also does freedom. From these things it may appear what freedom is, namely, it is that which is of the love and the will, and thence of the life of man. Hence it is, that what a man does from freedom, appears to him as if from his own proprium. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 141 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>141. (X.) DE LIBERO.<p>Omne liberum est amoris, nam quod homo amat hoc libere facit; inde quoque omne liberum est voluntatis, nam quod homo amat hoc quoque vult; et quia amor et voluntas faciunt vitam hominis, etiam liberum facit illam. Ex his constare potest quid liberum, quod nempe sit id quod est amoris et voluntatis et inde vitae hominis. Inde est quod id quod homo ex libero facit, appareat ei sicut ex suo proprio. </p>
