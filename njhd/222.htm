<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷及其属天的教义》 第222节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>222、对于上述内容，我补充《属天的奥秘》一书（<a href="../ac/9127.htm">9127</a>节）中的一些细节：人若对圣言的内义或灵义一无所知，就只知道当圣言提到“肉”和“血”时，“肉”和“血”是指实际的肉和血。但内义或灵义并不论述肉体生命，而是论述人之灵魂的生命，也就是他要活到永远的属灵生命。这生命在圣言的字义中以属于肉体生命的事物，也就是“肉”和“血”来描述；由于人的属灵生命靠爱之良善和信之真理来维持，所以就圣言的内义而言，“肉”表示爱之良善，“血”表示信之真理。这就是“肉和血”在天上的意思，这也是“饼和酒”的意思，因为在天上，“饼”和“肉”是一个意思，“酒”和“血”是一个意思。那些非属灵的人不明白这一点，所以就让他们继续持守自己的信仰吧，只要他们相信圣餐和圣言里面有神圣，因为它们来自主，尽管他们不知道这神圣居于何处。另一方面，让那些具有内在感知的人认真想想下列经文中的“肉”是不是指肉，“血”是不是指血。启示录：</p><p>我看见一位天使站在日头中，向空中所飞的一切鸟大声呼喊说，你们聚集来赴大神的筵席！可以吃君王的肉，千夫长的肉，壮士的肉，马和骑马者的肉，并自主的，为奴的，小的大的，众人的肉。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.17.htm">19:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.18.htm">18</a>）</p><p>若不知道“肉”、“君王”、“千夫长”、“壮士”、“马”、“骑马者”、“自主的”和“为奴的”在内义上表示什么，谁能明白这些话？以西结书：</p><p>主耶和华如此说，你要对天上的各种飞鸟、对田野的各走兽说，你们聚集来吧，要从四围聚集来赴我为你们所献的祭筵，就是在以色列山上的大祭筵，好叫你们吃肉喝血。你们要吃勇士的肉，喝地上首领的血。从我为你们所献的祭筵，你们要吃脂肪吃到饱足，喝血到喝到醉。你们要在我席上饱吃马匹和战车，并勇士和一切的战士。我必这样在列族中建立我的荣耀。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.17.htm">39:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.21.htm">21</a>）</p><p>这段经文论述的是把所有人都召聚到主的国度，特别论述了教会在外邦人或非基督徒当中的建立；“吃肉喝血”表示他们将神性良善和神性真理，因而将从主的神性人身发出的神圣归为己有。当经上说他们“要吃勇士的肉，喝地上首领的血”，“喝血到喝到醉”，以及“饱吃马匹和战车，并勇士和一切的战士”时，谁不明白，此处“肉”不是指肉，“血”也不是指血？至于“天上的飞鸟”和“田野的走兽”在灵义上表示什么，可参看《天堂与地狱》一书（<a href="../hh/110.htm">110</a>节和那里的脚注）。现在让我们认真想想主在约翰福音中论到祂的肉和血是怎么说的：</p><p>我所要赐的食物，就是我的肉。我实实在在地告诉你们，你们若不吃人子的肉，不喝人子的血，就没有生命在你们里面。吃我肉，喝我血的人就有永生。在末日我要叫他复活。我的肉真是可吃的，我的血真是可喝的。吃我肉喝我血的人，住在我里面，我也住在他里面。这就是从天上降下来的食物。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.51.htm">6:51</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.58.htm">58</a>）</p><p>主的“肉”是指神性良善，祂的“血”是指神性真理，两者都来自祂，这是显而易见的，因为这些滋养人的属灵生命。这就是为何经上说：“我的肉真是可吃的，我的血真是可喝的”；由于人通过神性良善和真理与主结合，所以经上还说：“吃我肉，喝我血的人就有永生”，以及他“住在我里面，我也住在他里面”；在该章前面部分：</p><p>不要为那必朽坏的食物劳力，要为那存到永生的食物劳力。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.27.htm">6:27</a>）</p><p>主自己在约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.2.htm">15:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.12.htm">12</a>）中教导，“住在主里面”是指住在对祂的爱里面。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>222、这里我要加上一些摘自《属天的奥秘》一书的描述 （<a href="../ac/9127.htm">9127</a>）：不知道圣经内层或属灵含义的人，当圣经提到“血与肉”时，他们只会认为就是血和肉。但在内层或属灵含义里，它不是关于肉体的生命，而是关于人灵魂的生命，即他的属灵生命，这个生命会活到永远。这种生命在圣经字意中描述为肉体生命的“血和肉”。由于人的属灵生命因爱的良善和信仰真理而存在，因此，在圣经的内层含义里，“肉”表示出于爱的善行，“血”表示信仰的真理。这就是在天堂里“肉与血”所表达的意思。这也是“饼和酒”的意思，因为在天堂“饼”与“肉”表示的意思完全相同，“酒”与“血”表示的意思完全相同。不属灵的人不理解这些，但仍然值得让这样的人持守自己的信仰，只要他们相信在圣餐和圣经中有来自主的圣洁，尽管他们可能不知道圣洁在哪。如果他们被赐予了属灵知觉，就可以让他们考虑下文中的“肉”是否意味着肉，“血”是否意味着血。</p><p>在《启示录》里：</p><p>我又看见一位天使站在日头中，向天空所飞的鸟大声喊着说：“你们聚集来赴 神的大筵席，可以吃君王与成千将军的肉，壮士与马和骑马者的肉，并一切自主的、为奴的，以及大小人民的肉。”（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.17.htm">19:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.18.htm">18</a>）。</p><p>谁能理解这些文字？除非他知道“肉”、“君王”、“成千将军”、“壮士”、“马”、“骑马者”、“自由的”、“为奴的”表示的内层含义。在《以西结书》里：</p><p>主耶和华如此说：你要对各类的飞鸟和田野的走兽说；你们聚集来吧！要从四方聚到我为你们献祭之地，就是在以色列山上献大祭之地，好叫你们吃肉喝血。你们必吃勇士的肉，喝地上首领的血。你们吃我为你们所献的祭，必吃饱了脂油，喝醉了血。你们必在我席上饱吃马匹和坐车的人，并勇士和一切的战士。我必显我的荣耀在列国中（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.17.htm">39:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.21.htm">21</a>）。</p><p>这段论及的是召集所有人到主的国度里，特别是在外邦人中建立教会。“吃肉喝血”表示他们将自身融合于神的圣善和真理，也就是来自主的神圣人性的圣洁。当经文中说道“他们吃勇士的肉”、“喝地上首领的血”。“他们喝醉了血”、“他们饱吃马匹、坐车的人、勇士和一切的战士”时，谁会不知道这里的“肉”不表示肉、“血”不表示血？“天空中飞鸟”和“田野中的野兽”所表示的灵义可参阅《天堂与地狱》（<a href="../hh/110.htm">110</a>节及注释。现在让我们思考主所说关于祂的肉和血的话，在《约翰福音》里：</p><p>我所要赐的饼（粮），就是我的肉。我实实在在地告诉你们：你们若不吃人子的肉，不喝人子的血，就没有生命在你们里面。吃我肉、喝我血的人就有永生，在末日我要叫他复活。我的肉真是可吃的，我的血真是可喝的。吃我肉、喝我血的人常在我里面，我也常在他里面。这就是从天上降下来的饼（粮）。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.53.htm">6:53</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.58.htm">58</a>）</p><p>主的“肉”是神圣良善，祂的“血”是神圣真理，很明显都是来自祂，因为这些滋养着人的属灵生命。因此经上说：“我的肉真是可吃的，我的血真是可喝的。”因为人经由神圣良善和神圣真理与主联合，所以经上还说：“吃我的肉喝我的血的人，有永生”，并且“他在我的里面，我在他的里面”。这一章的前部分：</p><p>不要为那必坏的食物劳力，要为那存到永生的食物劳力（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.27.htm">6:27</a>）。</p><p>主自己在《约翰福音》（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.2.htm">15:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.12.htm">12</a>）中教导，“住在主里”就是在祂的爱里。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 222</h4><p>222. Here I would like to add something from <i>Secrets of Heaven</i> <a href="../ac/9127.htm">9127</a>. <sup>1</sup>People who know nothing about the Word's inner or <i>spiritual</i> meaning cannot help thinking that "flesh" and "blood" in the Word actually mean flesh and blood. The inner or spiritual meaning, however, is not about the life of the body but about the life of our soul-that is, our spiritual life, which we are going to live to eternity. In the literal meaning of the Word this life is described in terms of physical life, in terms of flesh and blood; and since our spiritual life is maintained by good things that we do out of love and the truth that belongs to our religious faith, in the inner meaning of the Word "flesh" means these good things done out of love, and "blood" means this truth of our faith. That is what "flesh" and "blood" are taken to mean in heaven. This is also what "bread" and "wine" mean, since in heaven "bread" has exactly the same meaning as "flesh," and "wine" has exactly the same meaning as "blood. "<p>Now, people who are not spiritual do not grasp this, so it is acceptable for them to continue in the beliefs they have, as long as they believe there is something holy in the Holy Supper and in the Word because these come from the Lord. Even though they do not know where this "something holy" is, if they are gifted with some inner perception let them ponder whether "flesh" means flesh and "blood" means blood in the following passages. From the Book of Revelation:<p>I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, "Gather together for the supper of the great God, so that you may eat the flesh of monarchs and the flesh of commanders, the flesh of the mighty, the flesh of horses and of those who ride on them, and the flesh of all people, free and slaves, both small and great. " (<a href="3927/revelation_19_17.htm">Revelation 19:17</a>, <a href="3927/revelation_19_18.htm">18</a>)<p>What would anyone make of this who does not know the inner meaning of flesh and the inner meaning of monarchs, commanders, the mighty, horses, those who ride on them, the free, and slaves? And in Ezekiel:<p>Thus says the Lord Jehovih, <sup>2</sup>"Say to every bird of heaven and to every beast of the field, ‘Gather and come. Gather yourselves from all around for my sacrifice, which I am sacrificing for you, a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, so that you may eat flesh and drink blood. You will eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the rulers of the earth. You will eat fat until you are full and drink blood until you are drunk, from my sacrifice, which I will sacrifice for you. At my table you will eat your fill of horses and chariots and the mighty and every man of war. This is how I will establish my glory among the nations. '" (<a href="3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_18.htm">18</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_20.htm">20</a>, <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_21.htm">21</a>)<p>This is about calling everyone to the Lord's kingdom, and is specifically about the establishment of the church among non-Christians; "eating flesh and drinking blood" means their taking into themselves divine goodness and divine truth-therefore something holy that emanates from the Lord's divine-human nature. When it speaks about "eating the flesh of the mighty," "drinking the blood of rulers," and "drinking blood until we are drunk," can anyone fail to see that "flesh" here does not mean flesh and that "blood" does not mean blood? Who cannot see that "eating our fill of horses and chariots and the mighty and every man of war" is not to be taken literally? As for the spiritual meaning of "the birds of heaven and the beasts of the field," see <i>Heaven and Hell</i> <a href="../hh/110.htm">110</a> and the footnote there. <p>Now consider what the Lord said in John about his own flesh and blood:<p>The bread that I will give is my flesh. Truly, truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Humanity <sup>3</sup>and drink his blood, you will not have life within you. Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life; I will raise them up on the last day. My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink. Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood live in me and I in them. This is the bread that came down from heaven. (<a href="3927/john_6_51.htm">John 6:51-58</a>)<p>The fact that the Lord's flesh means divine goodness and that his blood means divine truth, both of which come from him, can be seen from consideration that these are what nourish our spiritual life. This is why it says that "my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink"; and because we are joined to the Lord by means of divine goodness and truth, it also says, "Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life" and "live in me and I in them"; and earlier in the chapter we are told, "Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life" (<a href="3927/john_6_27.htm">John 6:27</a>). <i>The Lord</i> himself tells us in<a href="3927/john_15_2.htm">John 15:2-12</a> that "abiding in the Lord" is abiding in a love for him. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The passage that follows here in the remainder of <i>New Jerusalem</i> <a href="222.htm">222</a> is indeed based on <i>Secrets of Heaven</i> <a href="../ac/9127.htm">9127[2-4]</a>, and it is marked in the Latin first edition as an extract. But it is very heavily edited. It not only omits major parts of <i>Secrets of Heaven</i> <a href="../ac/9127.htm">9127</a>, it includes substantial new material. One minor example of these changes is that its reference to <i>Heaven and Hell</i> is not, and could not have been, in the original passage, since Heaven and Hell was not written until after Secrets of Heaven was published. [SS]<p>2.&nbsp;This form of the divine name, Jehovih, arose as a variant of Jehovah, for the origin of which see note 1 in <a href="201.htm">New Jerusalem 201</a> above. Specifically, at occurrences of the combination אֲדֹנָי‭ ‬יהוה ('ăḏōnāi yhvh), "the Lord YHVH," the vowels for אֱלֹהִים ('ĕlōhîm), or "God," were added, in adapted form, to the four consonants YHVH instead of the consonants for אֲדֹנָי ('ăḏōnāi), to make יֱהוִֹה (yĕhôvih). Swedenborg carefully represents this as "Jehovih. " For a traditional Jewish view of this vocalization, see Gikatilla 1994, 148-149. [GFD, RS]<p>3.&nbsp;The Latin phrase here translated "Son of Humanity" is <i>Filius Hominis</i>, which in turn translates the Greek ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου (ho huiòs toû anthrópou), traditionally translated "Son of Man," and rendered elsewhere in this edition as "Son of Humankind," "Child of Humankind," and "Human-born One. " In this passage from John, Jesus is applying the term to himself. Despite the simplicity of the literal sense of the term, its full meaning is sufficiently mysterious that scholars have generated a wide array of possible interpretations of the phrase in the course of a debate reaching back for centuries (see Borsch 1967; Colpe 400-477; Hare 1990). Given that the range of proposed meanings extends from humble humanity incarnate divinity, any single rendering of it will leave something be desired. It should be noted that the spiritual meaning of the term is explained very unambiguously by Swedenborg "as the Word" ( <i>The Lord</i> <a href="../lord/23.htm">The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem Regarding the Lord 23</a>); see <a href="../lord/23.htm">The Lord 23-28</a> for his summary of its uses in the Bible.

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 222</h4><p>222. To the above shall be added some things from the Heavenly Arcana, Arcana Coelestia 9127: "He who knows nothing of the internal, that is, the spiritual sense of the Word, does not know otherwise than that flesh and blood, when mentioned in the Word, mean natural flesh and blood. The internal sense, however, does not treat of the life of a man's body, but of the life of his soul, that is, of his spiritual life, which he is to live to eternity. This life is described in the Word in the sense of the letter, by such things as belong to the life of the body, namely, by flesh and blood; and since a man's spiritual life subsists through the good of love and the truth of faith, therefore in the internal sense of the Word the good of love is meant by flesh, and the truth of faith by blood. These things are understood in heaven by flesh and blood, and by bread and wine; for bread there has altogether the same signification as flesh, and wine altogether the same signification as blood. But those who are not spiritual men do not comprehend this: wherefore, let them remain in their faith, yet, let them believe that in the Holy Supper, and in the Word, because they are from the Lord, there is something holy. They may not know wherein this holiness consists, yet let those who enjoy interior perception, consider whether flesh means flesh, and blood, blood, in the following passages. In the <a href="3927/revelation_19_17.htm">Revelation 19:17-18</a>, "I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying unto all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains of thousands, and the flesh of the strong ones, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit upon them, and the flesh of all both free and bond, both small and great." Who can possibly understand these words, unless he knows what is meant in the internal sense by flesh, and what by kings, captains of thousands, strong ones, horses, them that sit on them, freemen and bondmen? And in <a href="3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17-21</a>, "Thus said the Lord Jehovih, Say to, every bird of heaven, to every wild beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves from every side to My sacrifice that I sacrifice for you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel; that ye may eat flesh and drink blood. Ye shall eat the flesh of the strong ones, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth; and ye: shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood even to drunkenness, of My sacrifice which I shall sacrifice for you. Ye shall be filled at My table, with the horse and the chariot, and with the strong one, and with every man (vir) of war; thus will I set My glory among the nations." Here the calling together of all to the kingdom of the Lord, and specifically the establishment of the Church among the gentiles, are treated of; and eating flesh and drinking blood signify appropriating to one's self Divine Good and Divine Truth, thus the Holy which proceeds from the Lord's Divine Human. Who cannot see, that flesh does not mean here flesh, nor blood, blood? as when it is said, that they should eat the flesh of the strong ones, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth; and that they should drink blood even to drunkenness; also that they should be filled with the horse, with the chariot, with the strong one, and with every man of war? What is meant by the birds of the heaven and the beasts of the field in the spiritual sense, may be seen in the work on <a href="../hh/110.htm">Heaven and Hell 110</a> and in the notes there. Let us now examine what the Lord said concerning His flesh and His blood, in <a href="3927/john_6_51.htm">John 6:51-58</a>, "The bread that I will give, is My flesh. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, ye shall not have life in you. Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day; for My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed. He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him. This is the bread which came down from heaven." That the Lord's flesh denotes the Divine Good, and His blood the Divine Truth, both proceeding from Him, may be seen from the fact, that these nourish a man's spiritual life. Hence, also, it is said, My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed: and since a man is conjoined with the Lord through the Divine Good and Truth, it is further said, Whoso eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and, He abideth in Me, and I in him; and in the former part of the chapter (verse 27), "Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto eternal life;" that abiding in the Lord means being in the love to Him, the Lord Himself teaches in <a href="3927/john_15_2.htm">John 15:2-12</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 222</h4><p>222. To the above shall be added some particulars from the Arcana Coelestia (n. <a href="../ac/9127.htm">9127</a>): "He who knows nothing of the internal or spiritual sense of the Word, knows no other than that 'flesh and blood,' when they are mentioned in the Word, mean flesh and blood. But in the internal or spiritual sense, it does not treat of the life of the body, but of the life of man's soul, that is, of his spiritual life, which he is to live to eternity. This life is described in the literal sense of the Word, by things which belong to the life of the body, that is, by 'flesh and blood'; and as the spiritual life of man subsists by the good of love and the truth of faith, therefore in the internal sense of the Word the good of love is meant by 'flesh,' and the truth of faith by 'blood.' These are understood by 'flesh and blood,' and by 'bread and wine,' in heaven; for 'bread' means altogether the same there as 'flesh,' and 'wine' as 'blood.' They who are not spiritual men, do not apprehend this; let such abide therefore in their own faith, only believing that in the Holy Supper, and in the Word, there is holiness, because they are from the Lord, although they may not know where that holiness resides. On the other hand, let those who are endowed with interior perception, consider whether 'flesh' means flesh, and 'blood,' blood, in the following passages. In the Apocalypse:<p>I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried with a great voice, saying unto all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, come and gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God; that ye may eat the flesh of Kings, and the flesh of commanders of thousands, and the flesh of the mighty, and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all, free and bond, small and great (<a href="3927/revelation_19_17.htm">19:17, 18</a>).<p>Who can understand these words, unless he knows what 'flesh,' 'kings,' 'commanders of thousands,' 'the mighty,' 'horses,' 'them that sit on them,' and 'freemen' and 'bondmen,' signify in the internal sense? And in Ezekiel:<p>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Say to every bird of heaven, and to every beast of the field, Gather yourselves together and come; gather yourselves together from every side to My sacrifice that I sacrifice for you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood; ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth; and ye shall eat fat to satiety, and drink blood even to drunkenness, of My sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you: thus shall ye be satisfied at My table, with horse and chariot, with the mighty, and with every man of war; thus will I give My glory among the nations (<a href="3927/ezekiel_39_17.htm">39:17-21</a>).<p>This passage treats of the calling together of all to the kingdom of the Lord, and in particular of the establishment of the church with the Gentiles; and 'eating flesh and drinking blood,' signify to appropriate to themselves Divine good and Divine truth, thus the holiness which proceeds from the Lord's Divine Human. Who cannot see, that 'flesh' does not here mean flesh; nor 'blood,' blood; as when it said, that 'they should eat the flesh of the mighty,' and 'drink the blood of the princes of the earth'; and that 'they should drink blood even to drunkenness'; also that 'they should be satisfied with horses, with chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war'? What 'the birds of heaven' and 'the beasts of the field' signify in the spiritual sense, may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell (n. <a href="../hh/110.htm">110</a>and the notes). Let us now consider what the Lord said concerning His flesh and His blood, in John:<p>The bread which I will give, is My flesh. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day; for My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed. He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him. This is the bread which came down from heaven (John <a href="3927/john_6_50.htm">6:50-58</a>).<p>'The flesh' of the Lord is the Divine good, and His 'blood,' the Divine truth, each from Him, is evident, because these nourish the spiritual life of man; hence it is said, 'My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed,' and as man is conjoined to the Lord by the Divine good and truth, it is also said, 'Whoso eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life'; and, 'He dwelleth in Me and I in him'; and in the former part of the chapter:<p>Labor not for the food which perisheth, but for that food which endureth to eternal life (John <a href="3927/john_6_27.htm">6:27</a>).<p>'To abide in the Lord' is to be in love to Him, the Lord Himself teaches in John (<a href="3927/john_15_2.htm">15:2-12</a>)". </p>

Sed illi qui non spirituales homines sunt, hoc non capiunt; maneant itaque in sua fide, modo credant quod in Sacra Cena ac in Verbo sanctum sit, quia a Domino. Sit quod non sciant ubi id sanctum; usque qui aliqua perceptione interiore pollent, expendant num caro per 'carnem,' et sanguis per 'sanguinem' intelligatur in his locis:-- In Apocalypsi,<p>'Vidi angelum stantem in sole, qui clamavit voce magna, dicens omnibus avibus volantibus in medio caeli,..Congregamini ad cenam magni Dei; ut comedatis carnes regum, et carnes chiliarchorum, et carnes fortium, et carnes equorum et sedentium super illis, et carnes omnium liberorum et servorum, parvorum et magnorum' (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_222/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_19_17-18" target=_top>Apocalypsi 19:17-18</a>);<p>Quis usquam haec intelliget, nisi sciat quid 'caro' in sensu interno significat, et nisi quid 'reges,' 'chiliarchi,' 'fortes,' 'equi,' sedentes super illis,' 'liberi' et 'servi?' Et apud Ezechielem,<p>'Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Dic omni avi caeli, omni bestiae agri, Congregamini et venite; congregate vos a circuitu super sacrificium meum, quod Ego sacrifico vobis, sacrificium magnum super montibus Israelis, ut comedatis carnem et bibatis sanguinem: carnem fortium comedetis, et sanguinem principum terrae bibetis,....et comedetis adipem ad satietatem, et bibetis sanguinem usque ad ebrietatem, de sacrificio meo quod sacrificabo vobis; satiabimini super mensa mea, equo, et curru, forti, et omni viro belli:...sic dabo gloriam meam inter gentes' ()."<p>(Agitur ibi de convocatione omnium ad regnum Domini, et in specie de instauratione ecclesiae apud gentes; et per "comedere carnem et bibere sanguinem," significatur appropriare sibi Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum, ita sanctum quod procedit a Divina Humano Domini. Quis non videre potest quod non caro per "carnem" et sanguis per "sanguinem" ibi intelligatur? ut quod "carnem fortium comederent," "sanguinem principum terrae biberent," et quod "sanguinem biberent usque ad ebrietatem;" tum quod "satiarentur equo, curru, forti et omni viro belli."

Qui comedit meam carnem et bibit meum sanguinem, habet vitam aeternam, et ego resuscitabo illum extremo die; nam caro mea est vere cibus, et sanguis meus est vere potus: qui comedit meam carnem, et bibit meum sanguinem, in Me manet, et Ego in illo. ....Hic panis est qui e caelo descendit' (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_222/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_6_50-58" target=_top>Johannes 6:50-58</a>).<p>Quod 'caro' Domini sit Divinum Bonum, et 'sanguis' Divinum Verum, utrumque ab Ipso, constare potest ex eo, quod illa sint quae nutriunt vitam spiritualem hominis; inde dicitur, 'Caro mea est vere cibus, et sanguis meus est vere potus:' et quia homo per Divinum Bonum et Verum conjungitur Domino, ideo etiam dicitur, 'Qui comedit carnem meam et bibit sanguinem meum, habebit vitam<p>Aeternam; et ille in Me manet et Ego in illo.'"<p>Et supra in eo capite,<p>"Ne operemini cibum qui perit, sed cibum qui manet in vitam aeternam" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_222/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_6_27" target=_top>Johannes 6:27</a>).<p>Quod "manere in Domino" sit esse in amore in Ipsum, Ipse Dominus docet apud <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_222/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_15_2-12" target=_top>Johannem 15:2-12</a>. </p>
