<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷及其属天的教义》 第6节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>6、还需简要说明“耶路撒冷”在圣言的灵义上表示什么。“耶路撒冷”表示教义方面的教会本身，因为在迦南地，圣殿，祭坛，祭物，因而神性敬拜本身，都在耶路撒冷，而非其它地方。这就是为何每年的三个节日都在那里庆祝，全地所有男丁都被吩咐去参加。这也是为何“耶路撒冷”在灵义上表示敬拜，或也可说教义方面的教会，因为敬拜是教义所规定的，并照教义来执行。经上之所以说“由神那里从天而降的圣城新耶路撒冷”，是因为就圣言的灵义而言，“城”和“镇”表示教义，“圣城”表示神性真理的教义，因为神性真理就是那在圣言中被称为圣的。它被称为“新耶路撒冷”的原因和“地”被称为“新”的原因相似。也就是说，如前所述（<a href="../ac/5.htm">5</a>节），“地”表示教会，“耶路撒冷”表示教义方面的教会。经上说它“由神那里从天而降”，是因为作教义源头的一切神性真理都由主那里从天堂而降。“耶路撒冷”不是指一座城，尽管它看似一座城，这一点从经上论到它的话明显看出来：</p><p>长、宽、高都是一样，共有一万二千斯他丢。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.16.htm">21:16</a>）</p><p>城墙的尺寸，按着人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸，共有一百四十四肘。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.17.htm">21:17</a>）</p><p>就如新妇妆饰整齐，等候丈夫。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.2.htm">21:2</a>） </p><p>后来天使说，你来，我要将新妇，就是羔羊的妻，指示你。他将圣城耶路撒冷指示我。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.9.htm">21:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.10.htm">10</a>）</p><p>在圣言中，正是教会被称为主的新妇和妻子：结合之前被称为“新妇”，结合之后被称为“妻子”。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>6、还需要简单讨论一下“耶路撒冷”表示的圣言灵意是什么。“耶路撒冷”表示就教义而言的教会自身，因为是在迦南地而非其它地方有神庙、祭坛和献祭，因而有神圣敬拜本身。为此每年还要庆祝三个节日，全地所有的男子都需要参加。</p><p>因此，这就是为什么“耶路撒冷”在灵义上表示就敬拜或教义而言的教会。因为敬拜是由教义规定并按其执行的。至于为什么说，“圣城，耶路撒冷由神那里从天而降”，是因为就圣言灵义而言，“一座城”或“一个镇”表示教义，“圣城”表示神圣真理的教义，因为在《圣经》里神圣真理被称为“神圣”。它被称为“新耶路撒冷”的理由一样，即“地”被称为“新”。因为如上所述，“地”表示教会，“耶路撒冷”表示就教义而言的教会，它被称为“由神那里从天而降”，因为教义从其而来的所有真理都是从天堂的主那里降下。“耶路撒冷”不表示一座城，虽然它看似一座城，从它被这样描述可显见：</p><p>长、宽、高都是一样，共有一万二千视距（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.16.htm">21:16</a>）</p><p>城墙的测量为一百四十四肘，按着人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.17.htm">21:17</a>）。</p><p>并且如文中所说</p><p>就如新妇妆饰整齐，等候丈夫（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.2.htm">21:2</a>）。</p><p>此后，天使说：</p><p>你到这里来，我要将新妇，就是羔羊的妻，指给你看。他将圣城耶路撒冷指示我（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.9.htm">21:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.10.htm">10</a>）。</p><p>在《圣经》里，教会被称为主的“新娘”和“妻子”。结合以前，她被称为“新娘”，结合以后，她被称为“妻子”。《属天的奥秘》能看到这些（<a href="../ac/3103.htm">3103</a>，<a href="../ac/3105.htm">3105</a>，<a href="../ac/3164.htm">3164</a>，<a href="../ac/3165.htm">3165</a>，<a href="../ac/3207.htm">3207</a>，<a href="../ac/7022.htm">7022</a>，<a href="../ac/9182.htm">9182</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 6</h4><p>6. I need to explain briefly what "Jerusalem" means in the spiritual meaning of the Word. "Jerusalem" means the essential church, with a focus on its body of teaching. This is because there in the land of Canaan and nowhere else were the Temple and the altar, there and nowhere else were sacrifices offered and consequently was actual worship of God performed. That is why the three annual festivals <sup>1</sup>were held there, and every male in the whole land was obliged to attend. That is why Jerusalem now, spiritually understood, means the church in regard to its worship or to its body of teaching-which amounts to the same thing, because its worship is defined by its body of teaching and performed as that body of teaching prescribes. <p>The reason it says "the holy city, the <i>New Jerusalem</i>, coming down from God out of heaven" is that in the spiritual meaning of the Word "a city" means a body of teaching, and "a holy city" means a body of teaching based on divine truth. This is because divine truth is what the Word refers to as "holy. " It says "the New Jerusalem" for much the same reason that it refers to the earth as new. That is, as just noted [<a href="5.htm">5</a>], "the earth" means the church and Jerusalem means that church in regard to its body of teaching. It is described as coming down from God out of heaven because all the divine truth that gives rise to a body of teaching comes down out of heaven from God. <p>It is obvious that "Jerusalem" does not mean a city (even though it looked like a city), because it says that its height was the same as its length and breadth, twelve thousand stadia (verse 16); that the measure of its wall, one hundred and forty-four cubits, was the measure of a human being, that is, of an angel (verse 17); that it was prepared as a bride adorned for her husband (verse 2); and that later "The angel said, ‘Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb. ' And he showed me the holy city Jerusalem" (verses 9, 10). It is the church that is called the Lord's bride and wife in the Word, his "bride" before they have been joined together and his "wife" afterward-see <i>Secrets of Heaven</i> <a href="../ac/3103.htm">3103</a>, <a href="../ac/3105.htm">3105</a>, <a href="../ac/3164.htm">3164</a>, <a href="../ac/3165.htm">3165</a>, <a href="../ac/3207.htm">3207</a>, <a href="../ac/7022.htm">7022</a>, <a href="../ac/9182.htm">9182</a>. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Festival of Unleavened Bread (Passover), the Festival of First Fruits (also known as the Festival of Harvest and the Festival of Weeks), and the Festival of Tabernacles (also known as the Festival of the Ingathering, Festival of the Booths, Sukkoth, Succoth, or Sukkot) were three major sacred holidays in the ancient Jewish calendar. For the biblical description of these events as originally instituted, see <a href="3927/exodus_23_14.htm">Exodus 23:14-17</a>; <a href="3927/exodus_34_18.htm">34:18-24</a>; <a href="3927/leviticus_23_4.htm">Leviticus 23:4-21</a>, <a href="3927/leviticus_23_33.htm">33-43</a>; <a href="3927/deuteronomy_16_1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1-17</a>.

<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 6</h4><p>6. I will also say a little about what Jerusalem refers to in the Bible’s spiritual meaning.<p>“Jerusalem” means the religion’s philosophy. It has this meaning because it was the one place in the entire land of Canaan that had the Temple and the altar, where the sacrifices took place — which means that divine worship took place in Jerusalem. Also, that was where the three yearly festivals were celebrated, which every male in the land was required to attend. So in the spiritual meaning, Jerusalem refers to the religion’s worship. This amounts to the same thing as saying that Jerusalem means the religion’s philosophy, since our worship is dictated by our religious philosophy and practiced according to it.<p>It is called “the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of the sky” because in the Bible’s spiritual meaning, towns and cities symbolize different philosophies. A “holy city” stands for a philosophy about divine truth, since divine truth is what the Bible calls holy.<p>It is called “New Jerusalem” for the same reason the land is called new. As I just said, “the land” stands for a religion, and “Jerusalem” means this religion’s philosophy.<p>It is described as “coming down from God out of the sky” because all divine truth comes out of heaven from God, and this religion gets its philosophy from divine truth.<p>Even though Jerusalem was seen as a city, it does not refer to an actual city. This is very clear from the way it was described:<p>* Its height was the same as its length and width:12,000 stadia [1,379 miles]. (verse 16)<p>* The measurement of its wall, 144 cubits [216 feet], was made “by human standards of measurement, which an angel was using.” (verse 17)<p>* It was “like a bride ready for her husband.” (verse 2)<p>* And later, “The angel said, ‘Come, I will show you the bride, the Lamb’s wife.’ And he showed me the holy city, Jerusalem.” (verse 9)<p>The Bible calls religion the bride and wife of the Lord: his bride before they are united, and his wife after they have been united. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 6</h4><p>6. I shall now state briefly what Jerusalem means in the Word in its spiritual sense. Jerusalem means the church as regards its teaching. This is because the land of Canaan and no other was where the Temple was, and the altar, there sacrifices were made, so there was the worship of God. For this reason too three festivals were held there every year, and every male throughout the land was ordered to attend them. It follows that Jerusalem in the spiritual sense means the church as regards worship, or, what is the same thing, as regards its teaching. For worship is laid down in what is taught and is conducted in accordance with this. <p>The reason it is called the holy city, the New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven is that, in the spiritual sense of the Word, city and town mean teaching; and the holy city means the teaching of Divine truth, for it is Divine truth which is called holy in the Word. It is called the New Jerusalem for much the same reason that the earth is called new; for, as I said just above, earth means the church, and Jerusalem that church as regards its teaching. It is said to be coming down from God out of heaven because all Divine truth, the source of teaching, comes down out of heaven from the Lord. <p>It is obvious that Jerusalem here does not mean a city, even though it was seen as a city, from its being said that its height was as its length and breadth, twelve thousand furlongs, and that the measurement of its wall was a hundred and forty-four cubits by the measure of a man, which is that of an angel (verses <a href="3927/revelation_21_16.htm">Revelation 21:16-17</a>). Also by it being described as made ready as a bride adorned for her husband (verse <a href="3927/revelation_21_2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>); and by the angel saying later on: <p>Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb. And he showed me the holy city Jerusalem. <a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">Revelation 21:9-10</a>. <p>It is the church which in the Word is called the Lord's bride and wife, bride before and wife after being united with Him. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 6</h4><p>6. It shall also be stated in a few words what is meant, in the Word, in its spiritual sense, by Jerusalem. Jerusalem means the Church itself with respect to doctrine; and this for the reason that there, in the land of Canaan, and nowhere else, were the temple and the altar, and that the sacrifices, and, consequently, the Divine worship itself, took place there. On this account, also, the three festivals were celebrated there every year, and to these every male throughout the land was commanded to go. This, then, is the reason why Jerusalem, in the spiritual sense, signifies the Church as to worship, or, what is the same, as to doctrine; for worship is prescribed by doctrine, and takes place according to it. It is said, "The holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven," because in the spiritual sense of the Word, a city and town signifies doctrine, and the holy city the doctrine of Divine Truth; for Divine Truth is what in the Word is called the Holy. It is called the New Jerusalem for a similar reason for which the earth is called "new" for, as said above, by earth or land is signified the Church, and by Jerusalem, that Church as to doctrine; it is said to come down from God out of heaven, because all Truth Divine, from which is doctrine, comes down out of heaven from the Lord. That by Jerusalem is not meant a city, although it was seen as a city, appears plainly from its being said that its height, like its length and breadth, was twelve thousand furlongs (verse 16); and that the measure of its wall, which was a hundred and forty-four cubits, was the measure of a man, that is, of an angel (verse 17); also from its being said to be prepared as a bride before her husband (verse 2); and that afterwards the angel said, Come, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife: and he shewed me that holy city, Jerusalem (vers. 9-10). The Church is what is called in the Word the bride and the wife of the Lord; she is called bride before conjunction, and wife after conjunction, see in the Heavenly Arcana, <a href="../ac/3103.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3103</a>, <a href="../ac/3105.htm">3105</a>, <a href="../ac/3164.htm">3164</a>, <a href="../ac/3165.htm">3165</a>, <a href="../ac/3207.htm">3207</a>, <a href="../ac/7022.htm">7022</a>, <a href="../ac/9182.htm">9182</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 6</h4><p>6. What is meant by "Jerusalem" in the spiritual sense of the Word, shall also be briefly stated. "Jerusalem" means the church itself as to doctrine, because there in the land of Canaan, and in no other place, were the temple, the altar, the sacrifices, and thus Divine worship itself. On this account, also, three festivals were celebrated there every year, to which every male throughout the whole land was commanded to go. This, then, is the reason why "Jerusalem," in the spiritual sense, signifies the church as to worship, or, what is the same, as to doctrine; for worship is prescribed in doctrine, and is performed according to it. The reason why it is said, "The holy city, New Jerusalem, descending from God out of heaven," is because, in the spiritual sense of the Word, "a city" [civitas] and "a town" [urbs], signify doctrine, and "the holy city" the doctrine of Divine truth, since Divine truth is what is called "holy" in the Word. It is called "the New Jerusalem" for the same reason that "the earth" is called "new"; because, as was observed above, "the earth" signifies the church, and "Jerusalem," the church as to doctrine; which is said "to descend from God out of heaven," because all Divine truth, whence doctrine is derived, descends out of heaven from the Lord. That "Jerusalem" does not mean a city, although it was seen as a city, manifestly appears from its being said that:<p>Its height was, as its length and breadth, twelve thousand stadia (Rev. <a href="3927/revelation_21_16.htm">21:16</a>).<p>And that the measure of its wall, which was a hundred forty-four cubits, was the measure of a man, that is, of the angel (<a href="3927/revelation_21_17.htm">Rev. 21:17</a>).<p>Also from its being said that:<p>It was prepared as a Bride adorned for her Husband (verse <a href="3927/revelation_21_2.htm">2</a>).<p>And afterwards the angel said:<p>Come, I will show thee the Bride, the Lamb's Wife: and he showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem (verses <a href="3927/revelation_21_9.htm">9, 10</a>).<p>The church is called in the Word "the Bride" and "the Wife" of the Lord; she is called "the Bride" before conjunction, and "the Wife" after conjunction. As may be seen in the Arcana Coelestia (n. <a href="../ac/3103.htm">3103</a>, <a href="../ac/3105.htm">3105</a>, <a href="../ac/3164.htm">3164, 3165</a>, <a href="../ac/3207.htm">3207</a>, <a href="../ac/7022.htm">7022</a>, <a href="../ac/9182.htm">9182</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 6 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>6. Quid per "Hierosolymam" in Verbo in ejus sensu spirituali intelligitur, etiam paucis dicetur. Per "Hierosolymam" intelligitur ipsa ecclesia quoad doctrinam; et hoc ex causa, quia ibi in Terra Canaan, et non alibi, Templum erat, altare erat, sacrificia fiebant, ita ipse cultus Divinus; quare etiam tria festa quotannis ibi celebrabantur, et ad illa omnis masculus totius terrae mandatus est ire: inde nunc est quod per "Hierosolymam" in sensu spirituali significetur ecclesia quoad cultum; seu, quod idem, quoad doctrinam; nam cultus praescribitur in doctrina, ac fit secundum illam. Quod dicatur, "Sancta civitas, Hierosolyma Nova, descendens a Deo e caelo," est quia in sensu Verbi spirituali per "civitatem" et "urbem" significatur doctrina, ac per "sanctam civitatem" doctrina Divini Veri, nam Divinum Verum est quod vocatur "sanctum" in Verbo: quod dicatur "Hierosolyma Nova," est ex simili causa ex qua "terra" dicitur "nova;" nam, ut mox supra dictum est, per "terram" significatur ecclesia, et per "Hierosolymam" illa ecclesia quoad doctrinam: quod dicatur, "a Deo e caelo descendens," est quia omne Verum Divinum, ex quo doctrina, descendit e caelo a Domino.
