<h4 align="center"></h4><p>290、当人认为父在主里面，圣灵从主发出时，他就拥有一位格里面的三位的观念。那时，三位一体在主里面，即：被称为父的神性本身，被称为子的神性人身和被称为圣灵的神性发出。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>290、我们关于神的概念是，一位神具有三方面的特性，圣父是主，圣灵来自主，于是三位一体集于主。神性本体称为圣父，神性人身称为圣子，发出的神性作为称为圣灵。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 290</h4><p>290. Our concept of God is a concept of three aspects in one person when we think that the Father is in the Lord and that the Holy Spirit emanates from the Lord. In this case all three aspects are in the Lord: divinity itself, which is called the Father; the divine-human nature, which is the Son; and divinity emanating, which is the Holy Spirit. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 290</h4><p>290. We have this concept of three parts of one person when we think of the Father as being in the Lord, and the Holy Spirit as coming from him. Then the three parts are in the Lord. The divine itself is called the Father, the divine humanity is called the Son, and the divine action is called the Holy Spirit. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 290</h4><p>290. One has an idea of three in one person, when one thinks of the Father being in the Lord, and the Holy Spirit proceeding from Him. There is then a Trinity in the Lord: the Deity Himself, which is called the Father, the Divine humanity called the Son, and the Divine proceeding, called the Holy Spirit. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 290</h4><p>290. The idea of three in one Person is held, when the Father is thought of as being in the Lord, and the Holy Spirit as proceeding from Him. The trinity is then in the Lord; namely, the Divine Itself which is called the Father, the Divine Human which is called the Son, and the Divine Proceeding which is called the Holy Spirit. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 290</h4><p>290. The idea of three in one Person is had, when it is thought that the Father is in the Lord, and that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him; the Trinity is then in the Lord, the Divine itself which is called the Father, and the Divine Human which is called the Son, and the Divine proceeding which is called the Holy Spirit. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 290 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>290. Idea trium in una Persona habetur, cum cogitatur quod Pater in Domino sit, et Spiritus sanctus procedat ab Ipso. Trinum tunc in Domino est; ipsum Divinum quod Pater vocatur, Divinum Humanum quod Filius, et Divinum procedens quod Spiritus sanctus. </p>
