<h4 align="center"></h4><p>30、由于宇宙万物都与良善和真理有关，教会的一切都与爱之良善和信之真理有关，还由于人之为人是因着这两种官能，所以本教义也论述它们；否则，人不可能对它们拥有一个清晰的概念，甚至不能为他的思维建立一个基础。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>30、然后，因为宇宙一切事物都与良善和真理有关，教会一切事物都与爱的良善和信仰的真理有关，又因为人是由那两种能力而来的人，所以人也被其教化。否则的话，人将对此一无所知，思想也无法得以稳固建立。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 30</h4><p>30. Now, since everything in the universe goes back to goodness and truth and everything about the church goes back to good things that are done from love and truth that belongs to faith, <sup>1</sup>and since we are human because of will and understanding, the body of teaching [I am presenting] deals with will and understanding as well. Otherwise we could have no clear concept of them, no solid foundation for our thinking. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Latin words here translated "truth that belongs to faith" are <i>verum fidei</i>. For a definition of one common meaning of this phrase in Swedenborg's works, see <i>Secrets of Heaven</i> <a href="../ac/9230.htm">9230[2]</a>: "‘The truth belonging to faith' . . . refers to everything [about religious knowledge] that has yet to develop a purpose as its goal or to look toward the way we live. So it refers to everything [about religious matters that] we know and hold in our memory, and to everything [on these matters that] we therefore grasp with our intellect and teach to others. " It is differentiated from "rational truth" and "earthly truth," meaning bodies of knowledge and understanding that are not religious in nature; see, for example, <i>Secrets of Heaven</i> <a href="../ac/3271.htm">3271</a>. In the present passage, the phrase clearly refers to such truth in its broadest and most abstract sense. As Swedenborg says, "As long as the church's truth goes no further [than merely being held in our memory], it consists in mere concepts and facts, and compared with goodness, it stands outside our real self" ( <i>Secrets of Heaven</i> <a href="../ac/9230.htm">9230[2]</a>). [SS] </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 30</h4><p>30. So everything in the universe relates to goodness and truth, and everything in religion relates to the good qualities that come from love and the true ideas that are part of faith. Also, our two capabilities of motivation and understanding are what make us human. That is why an explanation of motivation and understanding is also included in this religious philosophy. Otherwise we would not have a clear idea about them, and there would not be a solid basis for our thinking. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 30</h4><p>30. Now since all things in the universe have reference to good and truth, and since all things to do with the church have reference to the good which comes from love and the truth which comes from faith; and since it is the two faculties just mentioned which make a person a person, these subjects too must be discussed in this account of the teaching. Nor would it be possible otherwise for a person to form a distinct idea of them or found his thought upon them. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 30</h4><p>30. Now, since everything in the universe has relation to good and truth, and everything of the Church to the good of love and the truth of faith, and since man is man from those two faculties, they are for that reason dealt with in this Doctrine; else it would not be possible for man to have a distinct idea of them, and even for thought to have a foundation. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 30</h4><p>30. Since, then, all things in the universe have relation to good and truth, and all things of the church to the good of love and the truth of faith; and since man is man from those two faculties, therefore they also are treated of in this doctrine; otherwise man could have no distinct idea of them, on which to found his thought. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 30 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>30. Quia nunc omnia in universo se referunt ad bonum et verum, ac omnia ecclesiae ad bonum amoris et verum fidei, et quia homo est homo ex binis illis facultatibus, ideo de illis quoque in hac Doctrina agitur; alioqui nec posset distincta idea de illis ab homine haberi, ac fundari cogitatio. </p>
