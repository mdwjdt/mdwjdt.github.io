<h4 align="center"></h4><p>162、一个只以一种笼统的方式承认自己是个罪人，自称犯有各种罪恶，却不检查自己，也就是看不见自己的邪恶之人，的确会认罪，但这不是悔改的认罪。这样一个人因不知道自己的邪恶，所以生活一如既往。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>162、人若只是笼统地承认他是一个罪人，并且对一切恶行感到内疚，却不省察自己，也就是看不见自己特有的恶行，这样的人会认罪，但不会走向悔改。因为他不知道自己的邪恶，于是依然我行我素。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 162</h4><p>162. If all we do is make a blanket acknowledgment that we are sinners and declare ourselves guilty of all evils but without examining ourselves-that is, seeing our own particular evils-we are making some kind of confession, but not a confession that leads to repentance. Since we do not know what our evils are, we live the same way afterward as before. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 162</h4><p>162. If we only admit in a general way that we have faults, and consider ourselves guilty of everything that is bad without looking closely at ourselves and seeing our own faults, then we do admit that we have faults, but not in a way that makes us regret them. If we do not know what is wrong with ourselves, we will keep on living the same way we did before. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 162</h4><p>162. Anyone who acknowledges only in general terms that he is a sinner, and considers himself guilty of all kinds of evil without examining himself, that is, without seeing his sins, may make a confession, but it is not a confession of repentance. Because he does not know his evils, he goes on living as he did before. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 162</h4><p>162. A person who acknowledges only in a universal way that he is a sinner, and who declares himself guilty of all evils, and yet does not examine himself, that is, see his evils, makes indeed a confession, but not a confession of repentance. Since such a person does not acquaint himself with his evils, he lives afterwards, as he had done before. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 162</h4><p>162. He who only acknowledges universally that he is a sinner, and makes himself guilty of all evils, and yet does not explore himself, that is, see his own sins, makes confession, but not the confession of repentance; he, because he does not know his own evils, lives afterwards as he did before. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 162 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>162. Qui solum universaliter agnoscit quod peccator sit, et se reum omnium malorum facit, et non explorat se, hoc est, videt sua peccata, is confessionem facit, sed non confessionem paenitentiae: is quia non novit sua mala, vivit postea sicut prius. </p>
