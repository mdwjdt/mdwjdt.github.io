<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">四、总体上的爱</h4 ><p>54、一个人的真生命就是他的爱；爱如何，生命就如何，整个人也就如何。但构成这个人的，是主导爱或掌权的爱。这爱拥有许多从属于它的爱，也就是衍生物。这些爱虽以一种不同的形式显现，但仍包含在主导爱中，与它一起构成一个王国。主导爱就像它们的国王和首脑；它指挥它们，并通过它们如同通过居间目的关注并打算它自己的目的，也就是所有爱的首要和终极目的；它既直接又间接地如此行。被高于一切爱着的，正是属于主导爱的东西。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 54</h4><p>54. Love in General<p>What we love constitutes life itself to us: what our love is like determines what our life is like and therefore what we are like as human beings. In particular, it is the love that is dominant or supreme in us that makes us who we are. <p>That love has many loves that are subordinate to it, loves that derive from it. They take on various guises, but they are all nevertheless present within the dominant love, and together with it make one kingdom. The dominant love acts as the monarch or head of the rest; it governs them and works through them as intermediate goals, in order to focus on and strive for its primary and ultimate goal of all, doing this both directly and indirectly. <p>The object of our dominant love is what we love more than anything else. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 54</h4><p>54. Part II: Our Different Loves.<p>Chapter 4. Love in General<p>Our love is our life. Whatever our love is like, that is what our life is like — in fact, that is what our whole self is like.<p>But our primary or controlling love is what makes us the person we are. This love has many subordinate loves that come from it. These loves appear in different ways outwardly, but all of them fit in with the primary love and make one realm with it. The primary love is like their ruler and head. It guides them and uses them as intermediate goals in aiming for and working toward its own goal, which is the primary, underlying one. It does this in both direct and indirect ways. Our primary love is whatever we love more than anything else. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 54</h4><p>54. IV. ON LOVE IN GENERAL <p>A person's life is really the same as his love; and what his love is like determines what his life is like, in fact his whole personality. But what makes a person is his dominant or ruling love. That love has a number of subordinate loves with it, which derive from it. These appear to be different but are each a part of the dominant love and make up a single kingdom with it. The dominant love is as it were their king and chief; it controls them and by their instrumentality, using them as mediate ends, aims at and pursues its end which is the mainspring and ultimate of all, and this both directly and indirectly. What belongs to the dominant love is loved above all. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 54</h4><p>54. LOVE IN GENERAL <p>A MAN'S very life is his love; and such as the love is, such is the life, yea, such is the whole man: but it is the ruling or reigning love that constitutes the man. This love holds in subordination many loves, which are derivations; these loves appear under a different form, but still are contained in the ruling love, and together with it constitute one kingdom. The ruling love is like their king and head - it directs them, and through them, as mediate ends, it has respect to, and intends its own end, which is the chief and ultimate end of all the loves, and it does this both directly and indirectly. It is what belongs to the ruling love which is loved above all things. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 54</h4><p>54. IV. LOVE IN GENERAL.<p>The very life of man is his love, and such as the love is, such is the life, yea, such is the whole man. But it is the governing or ruling love which constitutes the man. That love has many loves subordinate to it, which are derivations. These appear under another form, but still they are all in the ruling love, and constitute, with it, one kingdom. The ruling love is as their king and head; it directs them, and, through them, as mediate ends, it regards and intends its own end, which is the primary and ultimate end of them all; and this it does both directly and indirectly. That which is of the ruling love is what is loved above all things. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 54 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>54. (IV.) DE AMORE IN GENERE.<p>IPSA vita hominis est ejus amor, et qualis est amor talis est vita, immo talis est totus homo: sed amor dominans seu regnans est qui facit hominem. Ille amor sibi subordinatos habet plures amores, qui sunt derivationes; hi sub alia specie apparent, sed usque singuli illi insunt amori dominanti, et cum illo faciunt unum regnum; amor dominans est sicut eorum rex et caput; is dirigit eos, et per eos, ut per fines medios, spectat et intendit finem suum, qui omnium primarius et ultimis est, et hoc tam directe quam indirecte. Id quod est amoris dominantis, est quod super omnia amatur. </p>
