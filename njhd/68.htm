<h4 align="center"></h4><p>68、人若与自己相比蔑视邻舍，视之为仇敌，除非邻舍向他献殷勤，尊敬并崇拜他，就是在爱自己。他若为了这类原因而仇恨和迫害邻舍，更是在爱自己。他若因此向邻舍充满报复欲，渴望毁灭他，尤其在爱自己。这些人最终以残忍为快乐。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>68、如果一个人鄙视他人，因为别人不同意他的意见或未能尊重他，他就视其为仇寇，这就是爱自己的人。类似的，一个人若因小嫌隙就恨友邻，迫害他，他就陷入更深的自爱中。他若进而燃烧着报复的怒火，或渴望友邻遭殃，他的自爱就愈加深重。这样的人将乐于伤天害理。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 68</h4><p>68. If we despise our neighbors or regard people as our enemies for merely disagreeing with us or not showing us reverence or respect, our life is a life of self-love. If for similar slights we hate our neighbors and persecute them, then we are even more deeply entrenched in self-love. And if we burn with vengeance against them and crave their destruction, our self-love is stronger still; people with this attitude eventually love being cruel. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 68</h4><p>68. We are selfish when we look down on other people in comparison with ourselves, and also when we think of people as enemies if they do not support us, or if they do not honor and admire us. We are even more selfish when we feel hatred toward people for those reasons, and attack them. And we are still more selfish when we burn with revenge against them and have a desire to ruin them. When we are like this, we come to love being vicious. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 68</h4><p>68. A person is in a state of self-love, if he despises his neighbour as compared with himself, if he treats him as an enemy, unless he shows him favour, stands in awe of him and pays him respect. He is even more in a state of self-love, if as a result he hates and persecutes his neighbour; even more so, if as a result he is fired with a desire for vengeance on him and longs for his ruin. Such people end up by loving to inflict violence. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 68</h4><p>68. That man is in the love of self who despises the neighbour in comparison with himself, and who considers him as an enemy unless he courts, reveres, and worships him. More yet in the love of self is he who, for such reasons, hates and persecutes the neighbour; and still more he who on that account burns with revenge against the neighbour, and covets his destruction. Such persons in the end delight in cruelty. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 68</h4><p>68. That man is in the love of self, who despises the neighbor in comparison with himself, who esteems him his enemy if he does not favor him, and if he does not respect and pay his court to him: he is still more in the love of self who for such reasons hates the neighbor and persecutes him; and he is still more so who for such reasons burns with revenge against him, and desires his destruction: such persons at length delight in cruelty. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 68 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>68. Ille homo in amore sui est, qui proximum contemnit prae se, qui inimicum illum habet si non sibi favet, et si non se veneratur et colit: magis adhuc in amore sui est, qui propterea proximum odio habet, et persequitur: et magis adhuc, qui propterea flagrat vindicta contra illum, et cupit ejus perniciem: tales tandem amant saevire. </p>
