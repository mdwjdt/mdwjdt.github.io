<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 225</h4><p>225. After the death of the body, our spirit has a human form that is visible in the spiritual world, just as it had a human form that was visible in this world. Our spirit enjoys the abilities to see, hear, speak, and have sensations, just as it did in this world, and is endowed with every faculty of thinking, willing, and doing, just as it was in this world. In a word, we are human beings in absolutely every respect, except that we are not clothed with the dense body we wore in this world. That we leave behind when we die, and we never put it back on. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 225</h4><p>225. When we are in the spiritual world after our body dies, we have a human shape just as we did before in the material world. We can see, hear, talk, and touch things just as we did in the world. We have every ability to think, want, and do things that we did in the world. In short, every single bit of us is still a person, except that we are no longer clothed in the crude body we had in the world. We leave that behind when we die, and we never go back to it. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 225</h4><p>225. After the death of the body a person's spirit appears in the spiritual world in human shape, exactly as in the world. He also enjoys the faculties of sight, hearing, speech and feeling, as in the world. He has to the full his faculties of thinking, willing and doing, as in the world. In short, he is a human being in every detail, except that he is not enclosed in the coarse body he had in the world. He abandons this when he dies, and never assumes it again. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 225</h4><p>225. After the death of the body, a man's spirit appears in the spiritual world in the human form, precisely as in the natural world. He also enjoys the faculty of sight, of hearing, of speaking, and of feeling, as he did in the world; and he is endowed with every faculty of thought, of will, and of action, as when he was in the world; in a word, he is a man as to each and all things, except that he is not encompassed with the gross body with which he was clothed in the world. This he leaves behind when he dies, never to resume it again. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 225</h4><p>225. The spirit of man after the death of the body, appears in the spiritual world in a human form, in every respect as in the world. He enjoys the faculty of seeing, of hearing, of speaking, and of feeling, as in the world; and he is endowed with every faculty of thinking, of willing, and of acting, as in the world; in a word, he is a man as to each and every thing, except that he is not encompassed with the gross body which he had in the world. This he leaves when he dies, nor does he ever resume it. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 225 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>225. Spiritus hominis post mortem corporis apparet in mundo spirituali in forma humana, prorsus sicut in mundo; gaudet etiam facultate videndi, audiendi, loquendi, sentiendique sicut in mundo; et pollet omni facultate cogitandi, volendi, et faciendi, sicut in mundo; verbo, est homo quoad omnia et singula, praeter quod non crasso illo corpore, quo in mundo, circumdatus sit; id relinquit cum moritur, nec usquam reassumit. </p>
