<h4 align="center"></h4><p>16、良善多种多样；总的来说有属灵良善和属世良善，两者在真正的道德良善中结合在一起。正如良善是多种多样的，真理也是多种多样的，因为真理属于良善，是良善的形式。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>16、良善有多重特性。概括地说包括属灵良善和自然良善，两者在真正的道德良善中结合。由于良善有多重特性，于是真理也如此；因为真理是良善的，表现为良善的样式。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 16</h4><p>16. Goodness takes many forms. Basically, it can be spiritual or earthly, and these two types of goodness come together in what is genuinely good on the moral level. The same goes for types of truth as for types of goodness, because truths come from what is good and are forms of what is good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 16</h4><p>16. There are many different kinds of goodness. In general, there is spiritual goodness, material-level goodness, and both together in genuine ethical goodness. There are the same kinds of truth as there are of goodness, because truth goes with goodness. It is the form goodness takes. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 16</h4><p>16. There are many kinds of good. Generally speaking, there is spiritual good and there is natural good, and the two are linked in true moral good. What applies to kinds of good also applies to kinds of truth, because truths belong to good and are forms taken by good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 16</h4><p>16. Goods are manifold; in general, there is spiritual and natural good, and both are conjoined in genuine moral good. As it is with goods, so also it is with truths; for all truths belong to good, and are forms of good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 16</h4><p>16. Goods are manifold; in general there is spiritual good and natural good, and both are conjoined in genuine moral good. As goods are manifold, so also are truths, because truths are of good, and are the forms of good. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 16 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>16. Dona sunt multiplicia; in genere est bonum spirituale et bonum naturale, ac utrumque conjunctum in genuino bono morali. Sicut sunt bona, ita quoque sunt vera, quia vera sunt boni, et sunt formae boni. </p>
