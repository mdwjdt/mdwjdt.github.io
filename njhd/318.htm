<h4 align="center"></h4><p>318、牧师应当教导人们，应当通过真理把他们引向生活的良善。但他们绝不可以强迫任何人，因为没有人能被强迫去相信与他从心里以之为真理的东西相反的事物。若有人所信的与牧师不同，只要没有造成任何扰乱，就让他保持安静。但若他造成扰乱，就应当把他逐出；因为这也符合牧职为之存在的秩序。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>318、牧者应该教导人，并依真理引导他们过良善的生活，但是不应强迫任何人，因为无人能被迫去相信，与他所信的相反的事物。与牧者信仰不同、但不造成混乱的人，不要干涉他的平静。但是对那些制造混乱的人，应从教会逐出。这是牧者的职责，是为了维护秩序。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 318</h4><p>318. Priests are to teach the people and to lead them by means of truths to practice goodness in their lives. Priests are not to compel anyone, though, because people cannot be compelled to believe anything that contradicts what they think in their hearts to be true. People whose beliefs differ from those of the priest but who do not cause disturbances should be left in peace; but if they do cause disturbances, they should be removed [from the church]. This is part of the priesthood's responsibility to maintain order. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 318</h4><p>318. Ministers should teach people the truth, and in this way lead them to live a good life. However, they should never force anyone, because people can never be forced to believe anything contrary to what they believe in their hearts to be true. Anyone who believes differently than the minister and does not cause a disturbance should be left alone. Anyone who does cause a disturbance should be kept away, since this is one part of an orderly society that the ministry is meant to take care of. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 318</h4><p>318. Priests must teach the people and guide them to lead good lives. But still they must compel no one, since no one can be forced to believe what is contrary to what he thinks in his heart to be true. Anyone whose belief is different from the priest's should be left in peace, provided he does not make trouble. If he does make trouble, he should be expelled, for this too is in accordance with order for which purpose the priesthood exists. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 318</h4><p>318. Priests ought to teach the people, and through truths ought to lead them to the good of life; but still they ought not to compel any one; since no one can be compelled to believe what is opposed to that which in his heart he has thought to be true. He who believes differently from the priest, and does not make any disturbances, ought to be left in peace: but he who makes disturbances, ought to be separated; for this also belongs to the order for the sake of which the priesthood is. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 318</h4><p>318. Priests ought to teach the people, and to lead them by truths to the good of life, but still they ought to compel no one, since no one can be compelled to believe contrary to what he thinks from his heart to be true. He who believes otherwise than the priest, and makes no disturbance, ought to be left in peace; but he who makes disturbance, ought to be separated; for this also is of order, for the sake of which the priesthood is established. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 318 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>318. Sacerdotes populum docebunt, ac ducent per vera ad bonum vitae; sed usque nullum cogent, quoniam nullus cogi potest ad credendum contra id quod cogitavit ex corde esse verum: qui aliter credit quam sacerdos, et non turbas facit, relinquetur in pace; at qui turbas facit, separabitur; nam hoc etiam est ordinis, propter quem sacerdotium. </p>
