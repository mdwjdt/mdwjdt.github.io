<h4 align="center"></h4><p>66、当人在他所思所行的事上不关注邻舍，也不关注公众利益，更不用说主了，而是只关注他自己和自己的小圈子时，因而当他所行的一切都是为了他自己和自己的小圈子时，并且当即便为公众利益和邻舍做点什么，也只是为了表现时，他就是在爱自己。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>66、人在思考和做事时，若不关心他人，不关心公共利益，更不用说主了，他就是只爱自己，只想着自己，只在自己的小圈圈里打转。因此，他做任何事情都是为了他自己，和与他自己有关联的。如果他为公众和他人做了任何好事，也仅是为了露脸。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 66</h4><p>66. If we give no consideration to our neighbor in what we are thinking and doing and therefore no consideration to the public good, let alone the Lord, then we live a life of self-love; we think only of ourselves and our immediate circle. This means that everything we do is done for the sake of ourselves and our own; if we do anything to benefit the public and our neighbor, it is only for the sake of appearances. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 66</h4><p>66. We are selfish when we have no consideration for other people or for the common good — and especially not for the Lord — in anything we think or do. We think only of ourselves and our own family. Since everything we do is for the sake of ourselves and our family, if we do something for the common good or for other people, it is just to make ourselves look good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 66</h4><p>66. A person is in a state of self-love when in his thoughts and actions he pays no regard to his neighbour, and so not to the general public, much less the Lord, but only to himself and his own people. As a result, this is when all his actions are for the sake of himself and his people, and if he does anything for the general public and his neighbour, this is only for the sake of appearances. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 66</h4><p>66. A man is in the love of self, when, in what he thinks and does, he does not look to the neighbour, consequently, not to the common weal, and still less to the Lord, but only to himself, and to those who belong to him - when, therefore, all that he does is for the sake of himself and for the sake of those who belong to him; and if done for the sake of the public weal and the neighbour, it is merely for the sake of appearance. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 66</h4><p>66. Man is in the love of self, when, in those things which he thinks and does, he has no regard for the neighbor, nor for the public, much less for the Lord, but only for himself and his own; consequently when everything which he does is for the sake of himself and his own, and when, if he does anything for the public and his neighbor it is only for the sake of appearance. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 66 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>66.
