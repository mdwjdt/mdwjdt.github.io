<h4 align="center"></h4><p>29、正如合乎神性秩序的宇宙万物都与良善和真理有关，人里面的一切事物都与意愿和理解力有关；因为人里面的良善属于他的意愿，真理属于他的理解力。这两种官能，即人的这两种生命，是它们的容器和主体：意愿是属于良善的一切事物的容器和主体，理解力是属于真理的一切事物的容器和主体。人里面的良善和真理并不在别处。由于人里面的良善和真理不在别处，故爱和信也不在别处；因为爱属于良善，良善属于爱；信属于真理，真理属于信。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>29、由于遵循神性法则的宇宙一切事物都与良善和真理有关，因此人的一切事物都与意志和认知有关；因为人的良善属于他的意志，他的真理属于他的认知。由于这两种能力，即人的两种生命方式，是它们的容器和主体。一切属良善的事物的容器和主体——意志，一切属真理的事物的容器和主体——认知。所以人的良善和真理除此之外别无居所。由于人的良善和真理除此之外别无居所，因此爱和信也是一样。因为，爱属于良善，良善属于爱；信属于真理，真理属于信。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 29</h4><p>29. Just as everything in the universe that is in accord with the divine design goes back to what is good and what is true, so everything in us goes back to will and understanding. This is because whatever is good in us resides in our will and whatever is true in us resides in our understanding. These two abilities, or these two living parts of ours, receive and are acted upon by what is good and true: our will receives and is acted upon by everything that is good, and our understanding receives and is acted upon by everything that is true. Goodness and truth can be found nowhere else in us but in these faculties. Further, since they are not to be found anywhere else, neither are love and faith, since love and goodness are mutually dependent, and similarly faith and truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 29</h4><p>29. Just as everything in the universe that is in harmony with the divine plan relates to goodness and truth, everything in a human being relates to motivation and understanding. The goodness in us is our motivation, and the truth in us is our understanding. These two capabilities, or life forces, are the reservoir and ground for the goodness and truth in us. Motivation is the reservoir and ground for all our good qualities, and understanding is the reservoir and ground for all our true ideas. The goodness and truth in us are nowhere else. This means the love and faith in us are nowhere else either, since love and goodness relate to each other, and faith and truth relate to each other. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 29</h4><p>29. Just as all things in the universe which are in accordance with Divine order have reference to good and truth, so all things in a person have reference to the will and the intellect. For the good there is in a person belongs to his will, and the truth in him belongs to his intellect. For these two faculties, or these two aspects of a person's life, are designed to receive and be acted upon by good and truth. The will receives and is acted upon by everything to do with good, and the intellect receives and is acted upon by everything to do with truth. This is the only place where a person can have the various kinds of good and truth. And since it is the only place a person has for good and truth, so it is the only place for love and faith, because love is the product of good and good of love, and faith is the product of truth and truth of faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 29</h4><p>29. As everything in the universe, which is according to Divine order, has relation to good and truth, so everything with man has relation to the will and the understanding; because good with man belongs to his will, and truth with him belongs to his understanding. For these two faculties, that is, those two lives of man are their receptacles and subjects; the will being the receptacle and subject of all things pertaining to good, and the understanding the receptacle and subject of all things pertaining to truth. Goods and truths with man are nowhere else. And since goods and truths with man are nowhere else, so neither are love and faith; for love belongs to good, and good to love; and faith belongs to truth, and truth to faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 29</h4><p>29. As all things in the universe, which are according to Divine order, have relation to good and truth, so all things with man have relation to the will and the understanding; for good with man is of his will, and truth with him is of his understanding; for these two faculties, or these two lives of man, are their receptacles and subjects. The will is the receptacle and subject of all things of good, and the understanding the receptacle and subject of all things of truth. Goods and truths with man are nowhere else; and because goods and truths with man are nowhere else, so neither are love and faith elsewhere; for love is of good, and good is of love; and faith is of truth, and truth is of faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 29 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>29. Sicut omnia in universo, quae secundum Divinum ordinem sunt, se referunt ad bonum et verum, ita omnia apud hominem ad voluntatem et intellectum, nam bonum apud hominem est ejus voluntatis, et verum apud illum est ejus intellectus; sunt enim hae binae facultates, seu hae binae vitae hominis, receptacula et subjecta illorum; voluntas est receptaculum et subjectum omnium boni, ac intellectus est receptaculum et subjectum omnium veri; bona et vera apud hominem non alibi sunt: et quia bona et vera apud hominem non alibi sunt, ita nec amor et fides sunt alibi, quoniam amor est boni et bonum est amoris, ac fides est veri ac verum est fidei. </p>
