<h4 align="center"></h4><p>252、圣言因是来自神性的启示，故在每个细节上都是神性；因为来自神性之物不可能是别的。来自神性之物通过天堂降至世人；所以在天堂，它适合那里的天使的智慧，在尘世则适合世人的理解。因此，圣言包含适合天使的一个属灵的内在意义和适合世人的一个属世的外在意义。正因如此，天堂与世人通过圣言结合。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>252、圣言是神的启示，来自神的全部圣言，其信息无一例外都是神圣的。神的圣言通过天堂降至人类。因此，圣言在天堂适应于天使的智慧，在尘世适应于人的理解。因此，圣言有“内义”，即呈现给天使的灵义，它还有“外义”，即呈现给人的字义。从而天堂与人通过圣言相通。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 252</h4><p>252. Since the Word is a revelation from the Divine, it is divine in every detail. This is because whatever comes from the Divine cannot be otherwise. <p>Whatever comes from the Divine comes down to us through the heavens, so in the heavens it is adapted to the wisdom of the angels who live there, and on earth it is adapted to the grasp of the people who live here. Consequently, the Word has an inner meaning, which is spiritual and intended for angels, and an outer meaning, which is earthly and intended for us. For this reason it is the Word that joins heaven and us together. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 252</h4><p>252. Since the Bible is a divine revelation, every single part of it is divine. Anything that comes from the divine could be no other way. Everything that comes from the divine goes down through the heavens all the way to people on earth. In heaven it is adapted to the wisdom of the angels there, and on earth it is adapted to the understanding of the people there. So the Bible has an inner, spiritual meaning for angels and an outer, material-level meaning for people on earth. That is why our connection to heaven happens through the Bible. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 252</h4><p>252. Since the Word is a revelation from the Deity, it is Divine in every detail; for what comes from the Deity could not be otherwise. What comes from the Deity comes down through the heavens until it reaches human beings. It is therefore in the heavens adapted to the wisdom of the angels there, and on earth to the understanding of people there. The Word consequently contains an internal, spiritual sense for angels and an external, natural sense for human beings. As a result heaven is linked with human beings through the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 252</h4><p>252. Since the Word is a revelation from the Divine, it is Divine in each and all things; for what is from the Divine cannot be otherwise. What is from the Divine descends to man through the heavens; wherefore in the heavens it is accommodated to the wisdom of the angels who are there, and on earth it is accommodated to the comprehension of the men who are there. On this account there is in the Word an internal sense which is spiritual, for the angels; and an external sense which is natural, for men. Hence it is that the conjunction of heaven with man is through the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 252</h4><p>252. The Word, because it is a revelation from the Divine, is Divine in each and all things; for what is from the Divine cannot be otherwise. What is from the Divine descends through the heavens even to man; wherefore in the heavens it is accommodated to the wisdom of the angels who are there, and on earth it is accommodated to the apprehension of the men who are there. Wherefore in the Word there is an internal sense, which is spiritual, for the angels, and an external sense, which is natural, for men. Hence it is that the conjunction of heaven with man is effected through the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 252 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>252. Verbum, quia est revelatio a Divino, est Divinum in omnibus et singulis; nam quod a Divino est, non potest aliter esse. Quod a Divino est, id descendit per caelos usque ad hominem; quapropter in caelis accommodatum est sapientiae angelorum qui ibi, et in terris accommodatum est captui hominum qui ibi: quare in Verbo est sensus internus, qui spiritualis, pro angelis; et sensus externus, qui naturalis, pro hominibus: inde est quod conjunctio caeli cum homine sit per Verbum. </p>
