<h4 align="center"></h4><p>321、王权的尊严不属于人，而是附加于人。相信王权属于自己的国王，以及相信治权的尊贵属于自己的行政官，都是不明智的。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 321</h4><p>321. Royal majesty does not belong to the individual but is appended to her or him. Kings and queens who believe that royal majesty is intrinsic to themselves, and officials who believe that the dignity of their rank is intrinsic to themselves, are lacking in wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 321</h4><p>321. The authority to rule is not in the rulers themselves, but only associated with them. Rulers who believe that they themselves have the authority are not very wise. It is the same for officials who believe that the honor of their job belongs to them personally. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 321</h4><p>321. Royalty does not reside in the person, but is assigned to the person. A king who believes that the royalty resides in his person, and a governor who believes that the rank of governor resides in his person, is unwise. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 321</h4><p>321. The very regal office is not in the person, but is adjoined to the person. A king who believes that the regal office is in his own person, and a person in authority who supposes that the dignity of his office is in his own person, are not wise. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 321</h4><p>321. Royalty itself is not in the person, but is adjoined to the person. The king who believes that royalty is in his own person, and the governor who believes that the dignity of the government is in his own person, is not wise. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 321 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>321. Ipsum regium non est in persona, sed adjunctum est personae. Rex qui credit quod regium sit in sua persona, et praefectus qui credit quod praefecturae dignitas sit in sua persona, non sapit. </p>
