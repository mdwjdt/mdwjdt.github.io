<h4 align="center"></h4><p>61、作为一切良善和真理的源头的两种爱，就是前面所说的天堂之爱，打开并形成内在属灵人，因为它们住在内在属灵人里面。但作为一切邪恶和虚假的源头的两种爱，当掌权时则会关闭并摧毁内在属灵人，照着它们掌权的力量和性质而使一个人变得属世和感官化。</p><p>《属天的奥秘》摘录</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>61、对于一切良善和真理的爱，也就是之前讲述的天堂之爱，打开并构建人的内在灵性，因为这是它们的居所。但是当对邪恶和谬误之爱占据主导地位时，它们关闭和摧毁人的内在灵性，使其成为物质主义者和感官导向之人，其程度和性质取决于，这种爱占主导地位的程度。</p><p>摘自《属天的奥秘》</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 61</h4><p>61. The two kinds of love that are the source of everything good and true (which as just stated are the kinds of love in heaven) open and give form to our inner, spiritual self because that is where they live. However, when the two kinds of love that are the source of everything evil and false are in control, they close and wreck our inner, spiritual self and cause us to be materialistic and sense-oriented according to the extent and nature of their domination. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 61</h4><p>61. The two loves that everything good and true come from open and develop our inner spiritual self, because that is where they are in us. They are heaven’s loves. But when we are controlled by the two loves that everything evil and false come from, these loves close and destroy our inner spiritual self. They make us materialistic and physical-minded in proportion to their control over us. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 61</h4><p>61. The two loves which are the source of all kinds of good and truth, which, as has been said, are the loves of heaven, open up and develop the internal spiritual man, because that is where they reside. But the two loves which are the source of all kinds of evil and falsity when dominant close off and destroy the internal spiritual man. These make a person the more natural and influenced by the senses in proportion to the strength and nature of their dominance. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 61</h4><p>61. The two loves, from which are all goods and truths, and which as already observed, are the loves of heaven, open and form the internal, spiritual man; for they reside in it. But the two loves from which arise all evils and falsities, when they become dominant, close up and destroy the internal, spiritual man, and render a man natural and sensual in proportion to the extent and quality of their rule. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 61</h4><p>61. The two loves whence are all goods and truths, and which, as already observed, are the loves of heaven, open and form the internal spiritual man, because they reside there. But the two loves whence are all evils and falsities, when they rule, shut and destroy the internal spiritual man, and render man natural and sensual, in proportion to the extent and quality of their dominion. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 61 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>61. Bini amores ex quibus omnia bona et vera, qui, ut dictum est, sunt amores caeli, aperiunt et formant internum spiritualem hominem, quia ibi resident: bini autem amores ex quibus omnia mala et falsa, quando dominantur, claudunt et destruunt internum spiritualem hominem, ac faciunt ut homo sit naturalis et sensualis secundum quantum et quale dominii eorum. </p>
