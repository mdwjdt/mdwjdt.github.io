<h4 align="center"></h4><p>38、内在人被称为属灵人，因为它处于天堂之光，这光是属灵的；外在人被称为属世人，因为它处于尘世之光，这光是属世的。内在处于天堂之光，外在处于尘世之光的人在这两方面都是一个属灵人；而内在未处于天堂之光，只处于外在所处的尘世之光的人在这两方面都是一个属世人。在圣言中，属灵人被称为“活的”，而属世人被称为“死的”。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>38、内在之人被称为属灵之人，因为它处在天堂的光中，天堂之光是灵性的；外在之人被称为物质之人，因为它处在人间之光中，人间之光是物质的。内在处在天堂的光中、外在处在人间之光中的人，对两部分而言都是属灵之人。但是，内在不在天堂的光中，而是只在物质之光中，他的外在也一样，对两部分而言都是物质之人。在圣言中，属灵之人被称为“活人”，而物质之人被称为“死人”。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 38</h4><p>38. It is the inner self that is called a spiritual self because it is in heaven's light, and that light is spiritual. It is the outer self that is called an earthly self because it is in the light of this world, and that light is earthly. Anyone whose inner level is in heaven's light and whose outer level is in this world's light is a spiritual individual in both respects, but people whose inner level is not in heaven's light but in this world's light, where their outer level is as well, are earthly individuals in both respects. Spiritual individuals are the ones called "living" in the Word, while earthly individuals are the ones called "dead. " <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;For an example of the use of the terms "living" (or "being alive") in the sense "spiritually alive," and "dead" in the sense "spiritually dead," see <a href="3927/revelation_3_1.htm">Revelation 3:1</a>: "And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars: I know your works; you have a name of being alive, but you are dead" (New Revised Standard Version). For more on Swedenborg's interpretation of "living" and "dead" in the Bible, including numerous additional Bible references, see <i>Secrets of Heaven</i> <a href="../ac/7494.htm">7494</a>; <i>Revelation Unveiled</i> <a href="../ar/866.htm">866</a>; <i>Soul-Body Interaction</i> <a href="../isb/10.htm">10</a>; <i>Revelation Explained</i> (= Swedenborg 1994-1997a) 186.

<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 38</h4><p>38. Our inner self is also called our “spiritual self,” because it is in heaven’s light, which is spiritual. And our outer self is also called our “material self” because it is in the world’s light, which is material. If our inner part is in heaven’s light and our outer part is in the world’s light, we are spiritual on both levels. However, if our inner part is not in heaven’s light, but only in the world’s light (which our outer part is in as well), we are materialistic on both levels. In the Bible, spiritual people are called “living” and materialistic people are called “dead.” </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 38</h4><p>38. The internal man is what is called the spiritual man, because he is in heaven's light, which is spiritual light; and the external man is what is called the natural man, because he is in the world's light, which is natural light. A person whose internal is in heaven's light and whose external is in the world's light is a spiritual man in both respects; but one whose internal is not in heaven's light, but only in the world's light shared with the external, is a natural man in both respects. A spiritual man is called in the Word living, and a natural man is called dead. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 38</h4><p>38. The internal man is what is called the spiritual man, because it is in the light of heaven, which light is spiritual; and the external man is what is called the natural man, because it is in the light of the world, which light is natural. The man whose Internal is in the light of heaven, and whose External is in the light of the world, is a spiritual man as to both; but the man whose Internal is not in the light of heaven, but only in the light of the world in which also is his External, is a natural man as to both. It is the spiritual man, who, in the Word, is called a living man, and the natural man who is called a dead man. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 38</h4><p>38. The internal man is called the spiritual man, because it is in the light of heaven, which light is spiritual; and the external man is called the natural man, because it is in the light of the world, which light is natural. The man whose internal is in the light of heaven, and whose external is in the light of the world, is a spiritual man as to both; but the man whose internal is not in the light of heaven, but only in the light of the world, in which is his external also, is a natural man as to both. The spiritual man is called in the Word "living," but the natural man is called "dead." </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 38 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>38. Internus homo est qui vocatur spiritualis homo, quia est in luce caeli, quae lux est spiritualis; et externus homo est qui vocatur naturalis homo, quia est in luce mundi, quae lux est naturalis. Homo cujus internum est in luce caeli et externum in luce mundi, is spiritualis homo est quoad utrumque; at homo cujus internum non est in luce caeli, sed solum in luce mundi in quo etiam externum, is naturalis homo est quoad utrumque. Spiritualis homo est qui in Verbo vocatur "vivus," at naturalis homo qui vocatur "mortuus." </p>
