<h4 align="center"></h4><p>235、当人进入来世时（这种事死后即发生），他有没有天堂在自己里面就变得显而易见了；但只要他活在世上，这一点就不明显。因为在世上显现的是人的外在，而非内在；但在来世，内在就变得明显了，因为那时人活在灵里。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>235、在人死后立即进入来生，那时天堂是否在他的里面是显而易见的，但是在人间时不会显明。因为在人间显现的是人的外在，而非内在；但在来世，内在被显现出来，因为那时人是作为灵体存在。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 235</h4><p>235. When we arrive in the other life, which happens immediately after death, others can see whether heaven is within us, though this is not visible while we are living in this world. You see, what shows in this world is our outer self, not our inner self, while in the other life our inner self appears because then we are living as spirits. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 235</h4><p>235. When we get to the other life, which happens right after death, it is obvious whether or not heaven is in us. This is not obvious while we are in the world, though. In the world, people see our outer self, but not our inner self. In the other life, our inner self shows clearly, since we are then living as a spirit. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 235</h4><p>235. When a person comes into the other life, which happens immediately after death, it is plain whether he has heaven in him, but not so long as he lives in the world. For in the world the external is visible, but not the internal; but in the other life the internal becomes plain to view, since then the person lives in his spirit. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 235</h4><p>235. When a man comes into the other life, which happens immediately after death, it becomes manifest whether heaven is within him; but not so, while he lives in the world. For in the world the External appears, and not the Internal; but in the other life the Internal is made manifest, because the man then lives as to his spirit. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 235</h4><p>235. When man comes into the other life, which takes place immediately after death, it is evident whether heaven is in him or not; but not while he lives in the world. For in the world the external appears, and not the internal, but in the other life the internal is made manifest, because man then lives as to his spirit. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 235 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>235. Cum homo in alteram vitam venit, quod fit statim post mortem, patet num in eo caelum sit; non autem cum in mundo vivit: in mundo enim apparet externum, et non internum, at in altera vita patet internum, quoniam homo tunc quoad spiritum vivit. </p>
