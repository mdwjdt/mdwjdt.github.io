<h4 align="center"></h4><p>313、因此，必须有治理者维护人类社会的秩序，治理者应该精通律法，有智慧，并且敬畏上帝。治理者内部也必须有组织秩序，以防任何人因任性或无知导致邪恶发生，并因此破坏秩序。当上下级官员有等级从属关系时，尤其应该设置提防。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 313</h4><p>313. So there need to be officials to keep society in order-people who are skilled in the law, wise, and God-fearing. The officials also need their own organizational structure to prevent any of them, on some whim or out of ignorance, from allowing evils to occur that violate and therefore destroy proper order. This is guarded against when there are higher and lower officials in a hierarchical structure. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 313</h4><p>313. So there must be officials who will maintain order in human society. They should know the laws well, and they should also be wise and have a respect for God.<p>Order must be maintained among the officials too, so that, through ignorance or for their own pleasure, they do not allow people to do harmful things that go against an orderly society and destroy it. This can be avoided by having officials of higher and lower ranks, with some having authority over others. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 313</h4><p>313. So there must be governors to keep human societies in order. They must be learned in the law, wise and God-fearing. There must also be order among governors, to prevent anyone out of a whim or ignorance permitting evils contrary to order, thus destroying it. This is guarded against by having governors of higher and lower rank, so that one is subordinate to another. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 313</h4><p>313. Persons in authority, therefore, are necessary for keeping the assemblage of men in order; which persons ought to be skilled in the laws, wise and God-fearing. Order also should be among those in authority; lest any one, from favour or ignorance, should permit evils which are in opposition to order, and should thereby destroy order; which is guarded against when those in authority are higher and lower, and when there is subordination, among them. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 313</h4><p>313. There must therefore be governors to keep the assemblages of men in order, who should be skilled in the law, wise, and who fear God. There must also be order among the governors, lest anyone, from caprice or ignorance, should permit evils which are contrary to order, and thereby destroy it. This is guarded against when there are superior and inferior governors, among whom there is subordination. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 313 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>313. Erunt itaque praefecti, qui coetus hominum tenebunt in ordine, qui legisperiti, sapientes, et timentes Deum. Inter praefectos etiam erit ordo, ne aliquis ex lubitu aut inscitia permittat mala contra ordinem, et sic destruat illum; quod cavetur cum praefecti superiores et inferiores sunt, inter quos subordinatio. </p>
