<h4 align="center"></h4><p>18、因为邪恶和谬误与良善和真理相反，所以显然真理不能与邪恶结合，良善也不能与邪恶的谬误结合。如果真理和邪恶结合，它就不再是真理，而是谬误，因为它被篡改了。如果良善与邪恶的谬误结合，它就不再是良善，而是邪恶，因为它被掺了杂质。但是不属于邪恶的谬误可以与良善结合。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 18</h4><p>18. We can see from the fact that evil and falsity are the opposite of goodness and truth that nothing true can be joined to anything evil and nothing good can be joined to any falsity arising from evil. If anything true is put together with something evil it is no longer true; it is false because it has been distorted. If anything good is put together with some falsity arising from evil it is no longer good; it is evil because it has been polluted. A falsity that does not arise from evil, though, can be joined to goodness. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;In this paragraph, Swedenborg distinguishes carefully between truth as incapable of being joined to anything evil without becoming untrue, and goodness as being capable of being put together with something false without being polluted, provided that the falsity in question does not arise from evil. In other words, Swedenborg does not see the taint of incidental falsity as marring the good with which the falsity may come to be placed. A speculative example within his frame of reference would be those who love God and their neighbor, but do so without a specific knowledge of the Christian religion, and who therefore have a faulty understanding of the nature of God. The good of their love would thus occur together with the falsity of their knowledge, but would not be negated by it. A major consequence of this liberality of view is Swedenborg's inclusion of non-Christians within the scope of salvation; for in fact Swedenborg says that such people can have a good afterlife (see, for example, <i>Last Judgment</i> <a href="../lj/50.htm">50-51</a>). This would contrast with the situation of nominal Christians who do not love God or their neighbor-that is, those whose truth (their Christian beliefs) cannot be joined with the evil of their failure to act with love. For an example of the latter, see <i>Last Judgment</i> <a href="../lj/49.htm">49</a>, where the "goats" of <a href="3927/matthew_25_32.htm">Matthew 25:32-33</a> are identified with those who seek truth but do not do good. [SS] </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 18</h4><p>18. Evil and falsity are the opposite of goodness and truth. So we can see that we cannot combine truth with evil, or goodness with falsity that comes from evil. If we connect truth to evil, it is no longer true, but false, because it becomes distorted. If we connect goodness to falsity that comes from evil, it is no longer good, but evil, because it becomes corrupted. However, falsity that does not come from evil can be combined with goodness. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 18</h4><p>18. It is plain from the fact that evil and falsity are the opposites of good and truth that truth cannot be linked with evil nor good with the falsity which comes from evil. If truth is attached to evil, it is no longer truth but falsity, since it has been falsified. And if good is attached to the falsity which comes from evil, it is no longer good but evil, since it has been adulterated. However, the falsity which does not come from evil can be linked with good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 18</h4><p>18. From the circumstance that evil and falsity are opposed to good and truth, it is evident that truth cannot be conjoined with evil, nor good with the falsity of evil; for should truth be adjoined to evil, it is no longer truth, but falsity, because it has been falsified; and should good be adjoined to the falsity of evil, it is no longer good, but evil, because it is adulterated. Still, falsity not of evil can be conjoined with good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 18</h4><p>18. Since evil and falsity are opposite to good and truth, it is plain that truth cannot be conjoined to evil, nor good to the falsity of evil; if truth be adjoined to evil, it is truth no longer, but falsity, because it is falsified; and if good be adjoined to the falsity of evil, it is good no longer, but evil, because it is adulterated. But falsity which is not of evil may be conjoined to good. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 18 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>18. Ex eo, quod malum et falsum sint opposita bono et vero, patet quod verum non conjungi possit malo, nec bonum falso mali; si verum adjungitur malo, non amplius fit verum, sed falsum, quia falsificatum; et si bonum adjungitur falso mali, non amplius fit bonum, sed malum, quia adulteratum. At falsum non mali potest conjungi bono. </p>
