<h4 align="center"></h4><p>55、凡人胜过一切所爱之物不断存在于他的思维，以及他的意愿里面，并构成他最本质的生命，或说生命的真正核心。例如，如果他爱财富胜过一切，无论金钱还是财物，那么在他脑海里始终萦绕的是，他如何获得它们。一旦获得它们，他就感到最深的喜乐；一旦失去它们，则感到最深的悲伤；他的心在它们里面。人若爱自己胜过一切，就会在每件事上，甚至每时每刻都关注他自己：他思想自己，谈论自己，为自己而行动，因为他的生命是自我的生命。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>55、当人对某事物的爱胜过爱一切其他事物时，此事物频繁出现在他的思想中，和他的意愿里，并成为他生命的核心。例如，人若爱财富胜于一切，无论是金钱还是财产，他会时时盘算如何获得它。当他真的得到了，就心满意足；当失去它们时，他痛心疾首。因为他的心在那里。人若爱自己胜过一切，他会无时无刻都想着自己。他为自己盘算，宣扬他自己，所作所为都为他自己的利益。因为他的生命是纯粹为己的。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 55</h4><p>55. Whatever we love more than anything else is constantly present within our thoughts and also within our will. It constitutes the very core of our life. For example, if we love wealth more than anything else, whether in the form of money or of possessions, we are constantly considering how we can acquire it. We feel the deepest joy when we do acquire it and the deepest grief when we lose it-our heart is in it. <p>If we love ourselves more than anything else, we are mindful of ourselves at every little moment. We think about ourselves, talk about ourselves, and act to benefit ourselves, because our life is a life of pure self. </p> 
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 55</h4><p>55. Whatever we love more than anything else is constantly present in our thinking and our motivation. It is the central nature of our life. Here are a couple of examples:<p>If we love wealth more than anything else, whether it is money or possessions we want, we are always turning over in our minds how we can obtain it for ourselves. We feel very happy when we gain wealth, and very sad when we lose it, because our heart is in it.<p>If we love ourselves more than anything else, we keep ourselves in mind in every little detail. We think about ourselves, talk about ourselves, and do things for our own benefit, because our life is a selfish one. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 55</h4><p>55. What a person loves above all is constantly present in his thoughts and also in his will, and it makes up his life in the truest sense. For example, anyone who loves wealth above all, whether money or possessions, continually ponders in his mind how to get these; he feels the keenest pleasure when he acquires them, the keenest grief when he loses them. His heart is in them. Anyone who loves himself above all, remembers himself in everything, thinks about himself, talks about himself and acts for his own advantage; for his life is a selfish life. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 55</h4><p>55. What a man loves above all things is constantly present in his thought, and also in his will, and it constitutes his veriest life. For example, he who loves wealth above all things, whether it be money or possessions, constantly turns over in his mind how he may attain it: when he does attain it, he rejoices inwardly, when he loses it, he grieves inwardly; for his heart is in it. He who loves himself above all things, remembers himself in everything; he thinks of himself, speaks of himself, acts for the sake of himself: for his life is a life for self. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 55</h4><p>55. That which man loves above all things is continually present in his thought, and also in his will, and constitutes his most essential life. As for example, he who loves riches above all things, whether money or possessions, continually revolves in his mind how he may obtain them. He inmostly rejoices when he acquires them, he grieves inmostly when he loses them; his heart is in them. He who loves himself above all things regards himself in each thing: he thinks of himself, he speaks of himself, he acts for the sake of himself, for his life is the life of self. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 55 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>55. Quod homo super omnia amat, jugiter est praesens in ejus cogitatione, et quoque in ejus voluntate, et facit ipsissimam vitam ejus. Ut pro exemplo: -Qui super omnia amat opes, sive sint pecuniae sive possessiones, is continue animo versat quomodo illas sibi comparet, gaudet intime cum acquirit, dolet intime cum amittit; cor ejus est in illis. Qui super omnia amat se, is sui recordatur in singulis, de se cogitat, de se loquitur, propter se agit, vita enim ejus est vita sui. </p>
