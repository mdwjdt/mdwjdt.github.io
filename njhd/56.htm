<h4 align="center"></h4><p>56、一个人以他胜过一切所爱之物为目的，并在总体和每个细节上都关注它；它在他的意愿中，就像河中的暗流牵引并载走他，即便他在忙其它事，因为这是那让他充满活力的东西。被胜过一切爱着的东西就是一个人寻求并在他人身上所看到的某种事物，他利用这种事物来影响他人或与他人合作。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>56、人若爱某事物胜过其他一切，此事物就成了他的目标，为此他会全神贯注，精打细算。于是在他的意愿中，该心思就像河中的暗流，缠着他，拽着他，即便他忙于其它事情时。因为这已成了他生活的动力。人超越其他一切所爱的就是他所追求的，他在其他诸事上也会如此。他的心思可以影响他人，及与他人的合作。 </p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 56</h4><p>56. We have as our goal whatever we love more than anything else. This is what we focus on overall and in every detail. It is within our will like the hidden current of a river that draws and carries us along even when we are doing something else, because it is what animates us. <p>What is loved above all is also something we look for and see in others, and something we use to influence them or to cooperate with them. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 56</h4><p>56. Whatever we love more than anything else, we have as our goal in life. It is what we pay attention to in everything we do. It is present in our motivation like a hidden current in a river, pulling and carrying us along even when we are doing something else. It is what moves us. This primary love is what we look for and see in other people. Depending on what their primary love is, we either use it to influence them, or we work together with them. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 56</h4><p>56. Everyone has as his end in view what he loves above all. This is what he aims at in every detail of his life. His will contains something like a hidden current in a river, which drags and carries him away even when he is doing something else, for it is what motivates him. This is the kind of thing one person looks for and sees in another, and, depending on what he sees, he either leads him or acts jointly with him. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 56</h4><p>56. A man has for an end what he loves above all things, and has respect to it in each and all things; it is in his will, like the hidden current of a stream which draws and bears him away even when busy with something else; for it is that which animates him. This is what one man seeks for, and also sees, in another; and according to which he either leads him or acts with him. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 56</h4><p>56. Man has for an end that which he loves above all things; he regards it in each and all things. It is in his will like the latent current of a river, which draws and bears him away, even when he is doing something else; for it is this which animates him. It is such that one man explores and also sees it in another, and either leads him according to it, or acts with him. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 56 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>56. Homo pro fine habet id quod super omnia amat; illud spectat in omnibus et singulis: est in voluntate ejus sicut latens vena fluvii, quae trahit et aufert, etiam cum aliud agit, nam id est quod animat. Tale est quod unus homo apud alium explorat, et quoque videt; et secundum id vel ducit illum, vel agit cum illo. </p>
