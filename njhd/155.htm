<h4 align="center"></h4><p>155、由于一切良善和真理都来自主，无一来自人，并且凡来自人的良善都不是良善，所以可知，功德不属于任何人，只属于主。主的功德在于，祂凭自己的能力拯救人类，也会继续拯救那些从祂行善的人。这就是为何在圣言中，主的功德和公义若归给人，这人就被称为“义”；而人自己的公义和自己的功德若归给他，这人就被称为“不义”。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>155、因为一切良善和真理都来自主，并无一样出自人，凡出自人的良善都不是真良善，所以可知人不配荣耀，荣耀只属于主。主的荣耀在于祂凭自己的权能拯救人类，使得因祂的名而践行良善之人得蒙拯救。这就是为什么在圣言里，认为荣耀和公义都来自主的人，就被称为“公义的”，而把公义和荣耀归给自己的人，都被称为“不公义的”。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 155</h4><p>155. Since everything good and true comes from the Lord and nothing from us, and since anything good that comes from us is not really good, it follows that none of us has merit; only the Lord has merit. The merit of the Lord is that he saved the human race by his own power and also saves individuals who do good from him. <sup>1</sup><p>That is why the Word refers to people as "righteous" if the Lord's merit and righteousness are attributed to them but as "unrighteous" if their righteousness and merit come from themselves. <sup>2</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;On everything good and true being from the Lord and nothing good and true being from us, see <i>New Jerusalem</i> <a href="158.htm">158[2]</a>; <i>True Christianity</i> <a href="../tcr/626.htm">626-660</a>. For more on the Lord saving the human race by his own power, see <i>New Jerusalem</i> <a href="158.htm">158</a>, <a href="293.htm">293-294</a>, <a href="301.htm">301</a>; <i>True Christianity</i> <a href="../tcr/114.htm">114-125</a>. [Editors]<p>2.&nbsp;Possible examples of passages Swedenborg might have in mind include <a href="3927/ezekiel_16_49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49-52</a>; <a href="3927/ezekiel_33_12.htm">33:12-16</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_23_27.htm">Matthew 23:27-29</a>; <a href="3927/luke_18_9.htm">Luke 18:9-14</a>. For a treatment of the topic of righteousness that cites many further illustrative biblical passages, see <i>Secrets of Heaven</i> <a href="../ac/9263.htm">9263</a>, which is cited in this connection in <a href="158.htm">New Jerusalem 158:1</a>.

<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 155</h4><p>155. Since all goodness and truth come from the Lord, and none of it from us, and since anything good that comes from us is not good, we cannot take credit for anything — only the Lord can. It is the Lord’s integrity that rescued the human race by his own power, and which rescues us when we do good things for his sake. So in the Bible, people are called “fair” when they have the Lord’s integrity and fairness associated with them, and “unfair” when their own fairness and integrity are associated with them. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 155</h4><p>155. Since all good and truth is from the Lord, and none is from man, and the good which comes from man is not real good, it follows that merit belongs to no human being, but to the Lord alone. It is the Lord's merit that by His own power He saved the human race, and also continues to save those who do good from Him. That is why anyone to whom the Lord's merit and righteousness is attributed is called 'righteous in the Word, and anyone to whom his own righteousness and his own merit is attributed 'unrighteous'. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 155</h4><p>155. Since all good and truth are from the Lord, and nothing from man; and since the good coming from man is not good, it follows, that merit does not belong to any man, but to the Lord alone. The Lord's merit consists in this, that from His own power He has saved the human race; and that He also saves those who do good from Him. On this ground it is that, in the Word, he to whom the Lord's merit and justice are ascribed, is called just; and he to whom his own justice and the merit of self are ascribed, is called unjust. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 155</h4><p>155. Because all good and truth are from the Lord, and nothing of them from man, and because good from man is not good, it follows that merit belongs to no man, but to the Lord alone. The merit of the Lord consists in this, that from his own power He has saved the human race, and also, that He saves those who do good from Him. Hence it is that in the Word, he is called "just" to whom the merit and justice of the Lord are ascribed, and he is called "unjust" to whom are ascribed his own justice and the merit of self. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 155 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>155. Quia omne bonum et verum est a Domino, et nihil ab homine, et quia bonum ab homine non est bonum, sequitur quod nulli homini sit meritum, sed soli Domino. Meritum Domini est, quod ex propria potentia salvaverit genus humanum, et quoque quod salvet illos qui bonum ab Ipso faciunt. Inde est quod in Verbo "justus" dicatur, cui addicatur meritum et justitia Domini, ac "injustus" cui justitia propria et meritum sui. </p>
