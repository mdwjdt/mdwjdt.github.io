<h4 align="center"></h4><p>110、对一个人来说，当他意愿他所知道并察觉到的东西时，仁就与信结合；意愿与仁有关，知道并察觉与信有关。当人意愿并热爱他所知道并察觉到的东西时，信就进入他，并变成他的；在此之前，信在他之外。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>110、当人的理解与认知融合成为意志时，仁爱与信仰便在他里面结合了。意愿关乎仁爱，理解和认知关乎信仰。当人依据他理解并认知的真理去选择行动，且付出他的爱时，信仰就进入并成为他自己的一部分。在此之前，信仰不属于他。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 110</h4><p>110. Our caring is joined to our faith when we choose to do what we know and perceive to be true. Our caring is a function of what we choose to do, and our faith is a function of what we know and perceive to be true. Faith first enters us and becomes part of us when we choose to do what we know and perceive to be true, and when we come to love that truth. Until that happens, faith remains outside us. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 110</h4><p>110. Kindness unites itself with faith in us when we want to bring about what we know and realize. Wanting has to do with kindness, and knowing and realizing have to do with faith. Faith comes into us and becomes part of us when we want and love what we know and realize. Until then, it is outside us. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 110</h4><p>110. Charity combines with faith for a person, when he wills what he knows and perceives; willing relates to charity, knowing and perceiving to faith. Faith enters into a person and becomes his, when he wills and loves what he knows and perceives; until this happens, it is outside him. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 110</h4><p>110. Charity is conjoined in a man with faith, when he wills that which he knows and perceives: willing belongs to charity, and knowing and perceiving to faith. Faith enters into a man, and becomes his, when he wills and loves what he knows and perceives; but meanwhile it is outside the man. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 110</h4><p>110. Charity conjoins itself with faith with man, when man wills that which he knows and perceives; to will is of charity, and to know and perceive is of faith. Faith enters into man, and becomes his, when he wills and loves that which he knows and perceives; meanwhile it is without him. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 110 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>110. Charitas cum fide se conjungit apud hominem cum homo vult id quod scit et percipit; velle est charitatis, ac scire et percipere est fidei. Fides intrat hominem, et fit ejus, cum vult et amat id quod scit et percipit; interea est extra illum. </p>
