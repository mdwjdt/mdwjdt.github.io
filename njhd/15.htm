<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 15</h4><p>15. Since the joining together of goodness and truth is like a marriage, we can see that anything good loves what is true and that correspondingly anything true loves what is good. Each longs to be joined to the other. People in the church who do not have this love and this longing are not participating in the heavenly marriage. This means that the church is not yet in them, because the joining together of goodness and truth is what makes the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 15</h4><p>15. Since the relationship between goodness and truth takes the form of a marriage, we can see that goodness loves truth, and truth loves goodness. They want to be together. If we are religious but do not have this kind of love and desire, we do not have a heavenly marriage inside ourselves. This means religion is not yet inside us, since the relationship between goodness and truth makes religion. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 15</h4><p>15. Since the linking of good and truth resembles a marriage it is plain that good loves truth and truth in turn loves good, and one longs to be linked with the other. Anyone in the church who lacks such love and longing has not yet achieved a heavenly marriage. So the church is not yet present in him, for it is the linking of good and truth which makes the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 15</h4><p>15. Since the conjunction of good and truth is like a marriage, it is clear that good loves truth, and that in turn truth loves good, and that the one longs to be conjoined with the other. The man of the Church who has no such love and no such longing, is not in the heavenly marriage; thus the Church is not yet in him; for the conjunction of good and truth constitutes the Church. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 15</h4><p>15. Because the conjunction of good and truth is an image of marriage, it is plain that good loves truth, and truth, in its turn, loves good, and that one desires to be conjoined with the other. The man of the church, who has not such love and such desire, is not in the heavenly marriage, consequently the church as yet is not in him; for the conjunction of good and truth constitutes the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 15 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>15. Quia conjunctio boni et veri est instar conjugii, patet quod bonum amet verum, et vicissim verum amet bonum, et quod unum desideret cum altero conjungi. Homo ecclesiae cui non talis amor est et tale desiderium, non est in conjugio caelesti; ita non est in illo adhuc ecclesia; nam conjunctio boni et veri facit ecclesiam. </p>
