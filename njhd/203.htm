<h4 align="center"></h4><p>203、一切重生都由主通过信之真理和照之的生活实现。因此，洗礼见证了这一事实：一个人归入教会，能够重生。因为使人重生的主在教会被承认，而教会有圣言，圣言包含信之真理，这些真理是实现重生的手段。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>203、所有的重生都靠主完成，通过信仰的真理和遵循它们的生命而成。因此洗礼是人归入教会的见证，表明他能够被重生。因为教会有圣言且确信能使人重生的主；圣言包含信仰的真理，这真理乃重生之人必备的。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 203</h4><p>203. All our regeneration is carried out by the Lord, by means of truths that belong to religious faith and by a life in accord with those truths. This means that baptism is a witness that an individual belongs to the church and is capable of being regenerated, because it is in the church that the Lord, who regenerates us, is acknowledged; and it is there that we find the Word, which contains the truths of religious faith that are required for our regeneration. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 203</h4><p>203. All rebirth comes from the Lord through the true things in faith, and by living in harmony with them. So baptism demonstrates that we are religious, and that we can be reborn. It is through our religion that we know the Lord, who gives us rebirth, and through religion we have the Bible, where there are true things from faith through which we can be reborn. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 203</h4><p>203. All regeneration is accomplished by the Lord by means of the truths of faith and by living in accordance with them. Baptism therefore bears witness that a person belongs to the church, and can be regenerated. For in the church the Lord is acknowledged as the source of regeneration, and that is where the Word is to be found, and the Word contains the truths of faith which are the means of regeneration. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 203</h4><p>203. All regeneration is brought about by the Lord through the truths of faith, and through a life in accordance therewith. Baptism, therefore, bears witness of the fact that a person is of the Church, and is capable of being regenerated: for the Lord who regenerates is acknowledged in the Church; and in it is the Word in which are the truths of faith, through which regeneration is effected. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 203</h4><p>203. All regeneration is effected by the Lord, through the truths of faith, and a life according to them. Baptism therefore testifies that the man is of the church, and that he can be regenerated: for in the church the Lord is acknowledged, who alone regenerates, and there also is the Word, which contains the truths of faith, by which regeneration is effected. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 203 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>203. Omnis regeneratio fit a Domino per vera fidei, et per vitam secundum illa: ideo Baptismus testatur quod homo sit ab ecclesia, et quod regenerari possit; nam in ecclesia agnoscitur Dominus qui regenerat, et ibi est Verbum, ubi vera fidei, per quae regeneratio. </p>
