<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷及其属天的教义》 第145节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>145、由于在一个人看来，自由行动似乎是出于自我行动，所以天堂自由也被称为人的天堂自我，地狱自由被称为他的地狱自我。人生在地狱自我中，这种自我是邪恶的；人通过改造被引入天堂自我，这种自我是良善的。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>145、因为人自由的行为看似好像来自他自己，所以属天的自由也可称为属天的自我，属地狱的自由称为属地狱的自我。属地狱的自我是人生来就有的自我意识，是邪恶的；而属天的自我虽然也是自我意识，却是人被更新后才有的，是良善的。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 145</h4><p>145. Since acting from freedom seems to us to come from ourselves, heavenly freedom can also be called "heavenly selfhood" and hellish freedom can be called "hellish selfhood. " Hellish selfhood is the sense of self into which we are born, and it is evil. Heavenly selfhood, though, is the sense of self into which we come as we are reformed, and it is good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 145</h4><p>145. Since things we do in freedom seem to us as if we are doing them on our own, heavenly freedom could also be called a “heavenly self,” while hellish freedom could be called a “hellish self.” Our hellish self is in us when we are born, and it is harmful. We gain our heavenly self when we change for the better — and it is good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 145</h4><p>145. Since acting freely seems to a person to be following the dictates of one's own self, heavenly freedom can also be called the heavenly self; and hellish freedom can be called the hellish self. The hellish self is what one has by birth, and it is evil; but the heavenly self is what one acquires by being reformed, and it is good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 145</h4><p>145. Since acting from freedom appears to a man like acting from Self (proprium), heavenly freedom, therefore, may also be called a man's heavenly Self (proprium), and infernal freedom his infernal Self (proprium). Into his infernal Self (proprium) a man is born, and this Self is evil; but into the heavenly Self (proprium) a man is introduced by reformation, and this Self is good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 145</h4><p>145. Because acting from freedom appears to man as if from his own proprium, therefore heavenly freedom may also be called the heavenly proprium, and infernal freedom may be called the infernal proprium. The infernal proprium is that into which man is born, and this is evil; but the heavenly proprium is that into which man is reformed, and this is good. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 145 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>145. Quia ex libero facere apparet homini sicut ex suo proprio, inde liberum caeleste etiam vocari potest proprium caeleste; et liberum infernale vocari potest proprium infernale. Proprium infernale est in quod homo nascitur, et id est malum; at proprium caeleste est in quod homo reformatur, et id est bonum. </p>
