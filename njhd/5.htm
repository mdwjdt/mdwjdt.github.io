<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷及其属天的教义》 第5节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>5、关于新天堂就说这么多，现在说一说“新地”。“新地”表示地上的新教会，因为每当前一个教会走到尽头时，主就会建立一个新教会。主规定，地上总要有一个教会，因为教会是手段，通过它，主与人类，并天堂与世界有一个结合。主在教会为人所知，在那里能找到神性真理，而人通过神性真理与主结合。如今，一个新教会正在建立；对此，可参看《最后的审判》这本小册子（<a href="../lj/74.htm">74</a>节）。“新地”表示一个新教会的原因是圣言的灵义，因为就圣言的灵义而言，“地”不指陆地本身或具体的国家，而是指生活在那里的人民或民族及其神性敬拜；这就是与属世意义上的“地”相对应的属灵意义上的东西。</p><p>此外，当圣言提到“地”，没有附加任何具体国名时，它表示迦南地，自上古时代以来教会一直存在于迦南地。这就是为何圣言所提到的迦南地的一切地方和邻近地区或国家，包括山川，都成为教会的内在事物，就是我们所说的教会属灵事物的代表和象征。因此，如前所述，在圣言中，“地”因是指迦南地，故表示教会；此处的“新地”也是如此。教会将天堂称为“天上迦南”的习惯便由此而来。就圣言的灵义而言，“迦南地”表示教会，这在《属天的奥秘》一书处处都有说明，在此引用以下内容：大洪水前的上古教会和大洪水后的古教会都在迦南地（<a href="../ac/567.htm">567</a>，<a href="../ac/3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="../ac/4454.htm">4454</a>，<a href="../ac/4516.htm">4516</a>，<a href="../ac/4517.htm">4517</a>，<a href="../ac/5136.htm">5136</a>，<a href="../ac/6516.htm">6516</a>，<a href="../ac/9325.htm">9325</a>节）；于是，那地所有的地方都成为诸如在主国度和教会中的那类事物的代表（<a href="../ac/1585.htm">1585</a>，<a href="../ac/3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="../ac/5136.htm">5136</a>节）；这就是为何亚伯拉罕被吩咐去往那里，因为一个代表性教会将在他通过雅各所出的后代当中建立，一部圣言将要写成，这部圣言最外在的意义将由那地的代表和象征构成（<a href="../ac/3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="../ac/5136.htm">5136</a>，<a href="../ac/6516.htm">6516</a>节）。正因如此，圣言中的“地”和“迦南地”表示教会（<a href="../ac/3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="../ac/3481.htm">3481</a>，<a href="../ac/3705.htm">3705</a>，<a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="../ac/4517.htm">4517</a>，<a href="../ac/5757.htm">5757</a>，<a href="../ac/10568.htm">10568</a>节）。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>5、这些事物与新天堂有关。现在将说些有关“新地”的内容。“新地”指的是地上的新教会，因为当一个先前的教会结束后，主就会建立一个新的教会。因为主规定地上总要存有一个教会，因为借着教会才有一个主与人类的联合，以及一个天堂和世界的联合。因为主在教会被认识，联结主与人的神圣真理也在教会里。关于一个新教会届时会被建立的内容可见于《最后的审判》这本小册（<a href="../lj/74.htm">74</a>）。用“新地”表示新教会的原因是它出自圣言的灵意。在那种意义上，“地”不表示具体的国家，而是表示居于其上的民族，及其对神的敬拜。这，在属灵意思上，回应了属世意思上的“地”。</p><p>此外，当没有任何具体国家附于其上时，圣经中的“地”表示迦南地。自远古时代起，迦南地就有一个教会存在了。这就是为何圣经所提到的那里所有地方及领近国家，包括山和水在内，都成为教会内在事物或属灵事物的指代和象征。因此如其所述，圣经中的“地”因意指迦南地，所以表示教会；“新地”在圣经中也一样；因此教会形成惯例以天堂的迦南表示天堂。</p><p>“迦南地”的圣言灵义是指教会，《属天的奥秘》中多处可见，以下引述：</p><p>最远古的教会，即大洪水以前的教会，古代教会，即大洪水以后的教会，都在迦南地（<a href="../ac/567.htm">567</a>，<a href="../ac/3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="../ac/4454.htm">4454</a>，<a href="../ac/4516.htm">4516</a>，<a href="../ac/4517.htm">4517</a>，<a href="../ac/5136.htm">5136</a>，<a href="../ac/6516.htm">6516</a>，<a href="../ac/9325.htm">9325</a>）。因此那地的每处均指代主的国度和教会里这些事物（<a href="../ac/1585.htm">1585</a>，<a href="../ac/3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="../ac/5136.htm">5136</a>）。所以亚伯拉罕被指示去到那里，因为他的后裔雅各将建立一个代表的教会，并且将写下圣言，终极意义上，那地各处都为表示和象征（<a href="../ac/3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="../ac/5136.htm">5136</a>，<a href="../ac/6516.htm">6516</a>）。于是圣经中的“地”和“迦南地”表示教会（<a href="../ac/3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="../ac/3481.htm">3481</a>，<a href="../ac/3705.htm">3705</a>，<a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="../ac/4517.htm">4517</a>，<a href="../ac/5757.htm">5757</a>，<a href="../ac/10568.htm">10568</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 5</h4><p>5. That is enough at present about the new heaven; now for the new earth. The new earth means a new church on earth, since whenever one church comes to an end the Lord raises up a new one. You see, the Lord makes sure that there is always a church on earth, because the church is the means by which the Lord is joined to the human race, and heaven is joined to the world. This is because the church is where the Lord is known and where we find the divine truths by which we are joined to heaven and the Lord. (See the booklet <a href="../lj/74.htm">Last Judgment 74</a> on the fact that a new church is being established at the present time.)<p>"A new earth" means "a new church," as we learn from a spiritual understanding of the Word, because in the spiritual meaning "earth" does not mean the land itself, but the people there and their worship of God. That is the spiritual equivalent of "earth. " Then too, when we find a mention of "the earth" [or "the land"] in the Word with no further regional specification, it means the land of Canaan, and the land of Canaan was where the church had been ever since the earliest times. As a result, all the particular places there and thereabout that are mentioned in the Word, including mountains and rivers, have come to represent and symbolize inner realities of the church-what we speak of as its spiritual side. That is why, as just noted, "the land" in the Word refers to the church-because it means the land of Canaan, and the same holds true for "the new earth" here. This is what has led to the common practice in the church of referring to heaven as "the heavenly Canaan. " <sup>1</sup><p>In the spiritual meaning of the Word, "the land of Canaan" means the church, as has been shown in various passages of Secrets of Heaven, including the following: The earliest church (the church before the Flood) and the ancient church (the church after the Flood) were in the land of Canaan: <a href="../ac/567.htm">567</a>, <a href="../ac/3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="../ac/4454.htm">4454</a>, <a href="../ac/4516.htm">4516</a>, <a href="../ac/4517.htm">4517</a>, <a href="../ac/5136.htm">5136</a>, <a href="../ac/6516.htm">6516</a>, <a href="../ac/9325.htm">9325</a>. All the specific places then came to represent the kinds of things we find in the Lord's kingdom and the church: <a href="../ac/1585.htm">1585</a>, <a href="../ac/3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="../ac/5136.htm">5136</a>. That is why Abraham was commanded to go there-because symbolic religious practices would be instituted among his descendants through Jacob and a Word would be written whose most outward sense would be made up of the representations and symbolisms found in that place: <a href="../ac/3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="../ac/5136.htm">5136</a>, <a href="../ac/6516.htm">6516</a>. That is why "the land" and "the land of Canaan" in the Word mean the church: <a href="../ac/3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="../ac/3481.htm">3481</a>, <a href="../ac/3705.htm">3705</a>, <a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="../ac/4517.htm">4517</a>, <a href="../ac/5757.htm">5757</a>, <a href="../ac/10568.htm">10568</a>. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The term "the heavenly Canaan" was indeed a common trope in the homiletic literature of Swedenborg's time and earlier. Though Swedenborg is not alluding to the following works specifically, examples of this use include <i>A Clowd of Faithfull Witnesses, Leading to the Heavenly Canaan</i> (1607, 1618), a commentary on part of the Book of Hebrews by an English Puritan divine named William Perkins (1558-1602); and <i>A Cluster of Sweetest Grapes for Saints, Brought from the Heavenly Canaan</i> (1664) by the German clergyman Christopher Jelinger (around 1602-1685). The expression may derive from an allusion to Canaan in<a href="3927/hebrews_11_13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>. [RS, SS] </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 5</h4><p>5. So far I have been talking about the new sky. Now I will say something about the new land.<p>A “new land” means a new religion on earth. When one religious era ends, the Lord begins a new one. The Lord makes sure there is always religion on earth, since religion is what brings the Lord and the human race together. It also brings heaven and the world together. Through religion, we know about the Lord and we learn divine truth that brings us closer to him.<p>If we understand the Bible’s spiritual meaning, we can see that a new land symbolizes a new religion. In this meaning, when some territory is mentioned in the Bible, it does not refer to the land itself, but to the human society that lives there, and that society’s divine worship, since this is the spiritual side of a land.<p>Also, when the Bible talks about “the land” without naming any particular territory, it is talking about the land of Canaan. There has been religion in the land of Canaan since the very earliest times. Because of this, all the places in Canaan mentioned in the Bible, along with the surrounding regions, the mountains, and the rivers, came to represent and symbolize the deeper, spiritual levels of religion. Therefore, since “the land” means the land of Canaan in the Bible, it symbolizes religion, as I said before. The “new land” in this passage means the same thing. That is why it has become a Christian custom to say “the heavenly Canaan,” meaning heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 5</h4><p>5. So much for the new heaven. I shall now say something about the new earth. A new earth means a new church on earth, for when a previous church ceases to exist a new one is started by the Lord. For the Lord sees to it that there is always a church on earth, since the church is the means by which the Lord is linked with the human race and heaven with the world. A church is where the Lord is known and the Divine truths are to be found which enable people to be linked to Him. <p>The reason why a new earth means a new church is the spiritual sense of the Word. For in that sense earth does not mean any particular part of the earth, but the people who live there and their worship of God, since this is the spiritual element which takes the place of earth. Moreover, the earth in the Word without any geographical name means the land of Canaan; and there was a church in the land of Canaan from the most ancient times. That is how it comes about that all the places in that land and the surrounding area, together with the mountains and rivers, that are mentioned in the Word, became representations and symbols of such things as are the internals of the church, what are called its spiritual elements. That is why the earth, as I have said, in the Word means the church, because the land of Canaan is meant. So here a new earth has a similar meaning. From this has arisen the custom in the church of speaking of the heavenly Canaan, when one means heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 5</h4><p>5. Thus much concerning the New Heaven: something shall now be said of the New Earth. By the New Earth is meant a New Church upon the earth; for when the former Church ceases to be, a New Church is instituted by the Lord. For the Lord provides that there shall always be a Church on earth because through the Church there is a conjunction of the Lord with the human race, and of heaven with the world. For there the Lord is known, and Divine truths are there through which man has conjunction. That a New Church is being instituted at this time, may be seen in the small work on The Last Judgment [and the Destruction of Babylon], <a href="../lj/74.htm">The Last Judgment 74</a>. That by the New Earth is signified a New Church, is from the spiritual sense of the Word; for in that sense, by earth or land there is not meant any particular land, but the nation itself there and its Divine worship; for this is the spiritual equivalent of land. Moreover, in the Word, by earth or land, without the addition by name of any particular territory, there is meant the land of Canaan; and in that land the Church had been from the most ancient times. On this account all those places which were in it, and adjacent to it on all sides, together with the mountains and rivers, which are mentioned in the Word, have become representative and significative of those things which are the internal things of the Church, and which are called its spiritual things. Thence it is, as said above, that by earth or land in the Word, is signified the Church, because the land of Canaan is meant; such also is the meaning here of the New Earth; this is why it has become usual in the Church to speak of the heavenly Canaan, and by that to mean heaven. That in the spiritual sense of the Word the Church is meant by the land of Canaan, is shewn in the Heavenly Arcana, in various places; from which the following may be referred to: That the Most Ancient Church which was before the flood, and the Ancient Church which was after the flood, were in the land of Canaan, <a href="../ac/567.htm">Arcana Coelestia 567</a>, <a href="../ac/3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="../ac/4454.htm">4454</a>, <a href="../ac/4516.htm">4516</a>, <a href="../ac/4517.htm">4517</a>, <a href="../ac/5136.htm">5136</a>, <a href="../ac/6516.htm">6516</a>, <a href="../ac/9325.htm">9325</a>. That all places then became representative of such things as are in the Lord's Kingdom and in the Church, <a href="../ac/1585.htm">Arcana Coelestia 1585</a>, <a href="../ac/3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="../ac/5136.htm">5136</a>. That for this reason Abraham was commanded to go there, because among his posterity from Jacob, there would be instituted a representative Church, and a Word would be written, the ultimate sense of which would consist of the representatives and significatives, which are in that land, <a href="../ac/3686.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3686</a>, <a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="../ac/5136.htm">5136</a>, <a href="../ac/6516.htm">6516</a>. On this ground it is, that by earth or land, and by the land of Canaan, in the Word, the Church is signified, <a href="../ac/3038.htm">Arcana Coelestia 3038</a>, <a href="../ac/3481.htm">3481</a>, <a href="../ac/3705.htm">3705</a>, <a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="../ac/4517.htm">4517</a>, <a href="../ac/5757.htm">5757</a>, <a href="../ac/10.htm">10</a>, <a href="../ac/568.htm">568</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 5</h4><p>5. These things are concerning the New Heaven; something shall now be said concerning "the New Earth." By "the New Earth" is meant the New Church on the earth; for when a former church ceases to exist, then a new one is established by the Lord. For it is provided by the Lord that there should always be a church on earth, since by means of the church there is a conjunction of the Lord with the human race, and of heaven with the world; for there the Lord is known, and there are the Divine truths by which man is conjoined to Him. That a New Church is at this time being established, may be seen in the small work on The Last Judgment (n. <a href="../lj/74.htm">74</a>). The reason why a New Church is signified by "the New Earth" arises from the spiritual sense of the Word; for in that sense, by the "earth" no particular country is meant, but the nation dwelling there, and its Divine worship; this, in the spiritual sense, being what answers to earth in the natural sense.<p>Moreover, by "earth" in the Word, when there is no name of any particular country affixed to the term, is signified the land of Canaan; and in the land of Canaan a church had existed from the most ancient times; in consequence of which, all the places therein, and in the adjacent countries, with the mountains and rivers, which are mentioned in the Word, became representative and significative of the things which are the internals of the church, and which are called its spiritual things. Hence it is, as was said, that "earth" in the Word, because it means the land of Canaan, signifies the church; in like manner here by "the New Earth"; from this comes the custom in the church to speak of the heavenly Canaan, by which is meant heaven.<p>That "the land of Canaan," in the spiritual sense of the Word, signifies the church, is shown in the Arcana Coelestia, in various places, of which the following are here adduced:<p>The Most Ancient Church, which was before the flood, and the Ancient Church, which was after the flood, were in the land of Canaan (n. <a href="../ac/567.htm">567</a>, <a href="../ac/3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="../ac/4454.htm">4454</a>, <a href="../ac/4516.htm">4516, 4517</a>, <a href="../ac/5136.htm">5136</a>, <a href="../ac/6516.htm">6516</a>, <a href="../ac/9325.htm">9325</a>). Then all places in that land became representative of such things as are in the kingdom of the Lord, and in the church (n. <a href="../ac/1585.htm">1585</a>, <a href="../ac/3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="../ac/5136.htm">5136</a>). Therefore Abraham was commanded to go thither, since with his posterity from Jacob, a representative church might be established, and that the Word might be written, the ultimate of which should consist of representatives and significatives which are there (n. <a href="../ac/3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="../ac/5136.htm">5136</a>, <a href="../ac/6516.htm">6516</a>). Hence it is that "earth" and "the land of Canaan," when they are mentioned in the Word, signify the church (n. <a href="../ac/3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="../ac/3481.htm">3481</a>, <a href="../ac/3705.htm">3705</a>, <a href="../ac/4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="../ac/4517.htm">4517</a>, <a href="../ac/5757.htm">5757</a>, <a href="../ac/10568.htm">10568</a>). </p>
