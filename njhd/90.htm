<h4 align="center"></h4><p>90、主在马太福音也教导了这一点：主对那些处于良善的人说，他们给祂吃的，给祂喝的，留祂住，给祂衣服穿，看顾祂，到监里去看祂；后来说，只要他们做在他们弟兄中最小的一个身上，就是做在祂身上（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.34.htm">25:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.40.htm">40</a>）。从灵义上说，这六种良善包含了邻舍的所有不同种类。由此也明显可知，爱良善，就是爱主，因为主是良善的源头，在良善中并且就是良善本身。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>90、主在《马太福音》中也教导了这种情况：</p><p>主对那些良善的人说，他们给他吃的，他们给他喝的，他们留他住，给他衣穿，病的时候看顾他，在监里的时候看他。然后说，只要他们作在这弟兄中最小的一个身上，就是作在主的身上（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.34.htm">25:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.40.htm">40</a>）。</p><p>在灵意理解上，这六种类型的良善被理解为所有样式的友邻。因此同样的，当人爱良善时，也就是爱主，因为主为良善之源，主在良善中，祂是良善本身。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 90</h4><p>90. In fact the Lord tells us in Matthew that this is true. He said to the ones who had done good things that they had given him something to eat, given him something to drink, taken him in, clothed him, visited him, and come to him in prison, and then said that as much as they had done this to one of the least of his people, they had done it to him (<a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">Matthew 25:34-40</a>). These six good deeds, understood spiritually, comprise all the kinds of neighbor. <p>This also shows that when we love doing what is good we are loving the Lord, because the Lord is the source of what is good, the one who is devoted to what is good, and the one who is goodness itself. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 90</h4><p>90. The Lord was explaining this in Matthew when he told the people who did good things that they had given him something to eat and something to drink, had welcomed him, given him clothes, visited him, and come to him when he was in prison. Then he said that whenever they had done these things for one of the least important of his brothers, they had done it for him (<a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">Matthew 25:34-40</a>). When the six kinds of goodness mentioned in this passage are understood in their spiritual meaning, they include every possible way of being a friend to people. So you can see that when we love goodness, we are loving the Lord, since the Lord is the source of goodness: he does good things, and he is goodness. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 90</h4><p>90. This too the Lord teaches in Matthew; for He said to those in a state of good that they had given Him food, they had given Him drink, given Him hospitality, clothed Him, visited Him and come to Him in prison; and then that so far as they had done these things to the least of His brothers, they had done it to Him (<a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">Matthew 25:34-40</a>). Those six good deeds understood in the spiritual sense comprise all the different kinds of neighbour. It is also plain from this that when good is loved, the Lord is loved; for it is the Lord who is the source of good, who is in a state of good and who is goodness itself. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 90</h4><p>90. That such is the case, the Lord also teaches in <a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">Matthew 25:34-40</a>; for to those who were in good He said, that "they had given Him to eat, that they had given Him to drink, that they had taken Him in, had clothed Him, had visited Him, and had come to Him when in prison;" and afterwards, that "inasmuch as they had done it to the least of His brethren, they had done it unto Him." In these six kinds of good, as understood in the spiritual sense, are included all the various kinds of the neighbour. From this, also, it is evident, that when good is loved, the Lord Himself is loved; for the Lord is He from whom good is, who is in good, and who is good itself. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 90</h4><p>90. That this is the case, the Lord also teaches in Matthew:<p>For He said to those who were in good that they had given Him to eat, that they had given Him to drink, that they had gathered Him, had clothed Him, had visited Him, and had come to Him in prison; and afterwards that, so far as they had done it to one of the least of their brethren, they had done it unto Him (<a href="3927/matthew_25_34.htm">25:34-40</a>).<p>In these six kinds of good, understood in the spiritual sense, are comprehended all the genera of the neighbor. Hence, likewise, it is evident, that when good is loved the Lord is loved, for it is the Lord from whom good is, who is in good, and who is good itself. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 90 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>90. Quod ita sit, etiam Dominus docet apud Matthaeum;<p>Dixit enim illis qui in bono fuerunt, quod dederint Ipsi quod ederet, quod illi potaverint Ipsum, collegerint Ipsum, induerint Ipsum, visitaverint Ipsum, et in carcere venerint ad Ipsum: et dein, quod quantum fecerint uni ex fratribus suis minimis, Ipsi fecerint (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_90/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_25_34-40" target=_top>Matthaeus 25:34-40</a>).<p>In illis sex bonis in spirituali sensu intellectis comprehenduntur omnia genera proximi. Inde etiam patet quod, cum amatur bonum, ametur Dominus, Dominus enim est a quo bonum, qui in bono, et qui ipsum bonum. </p>
