<h4 align="center"></h4><p>237、正如爱主和爱邻构成人里面的天堂生命，爱自己和爱世界当占主导地位时，则构成地狱的生命；因为后两种爱反对前两种爱。因此，那些爱自己爱世界在里面占主导地位的人不能从天堂接受任何东西；凡他们所接受的，都来自地狱。凡一个所爱和所信的，要么来自天堂，要么来自地狱。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>237、正如爱主和爱友邻构成人在天堂的生命，当爱自己和爱世界成为主导时，它就构成了人在地狱的生命。因为前者之爱与后者是对立的。因此，爱自己和爱世界成为主导的人不能接受来自天堂的任何事物，而只能从地狱接受。一个人之所爱和所信，要么来自天堂，要么来自地狱。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 237</h4><p>237. Just as love for the Lord and love for our neighbor constitute a life of heaven for us, so love for ourselves and love for the world, when they are in control, constitute a life of hell for us, because these latter loves are the opposites of the former. So people whose love for themselves and love for the world are in control are incapable of accepting anything from heaven. What they accept comes from hell. Whatever we love and whatever we believe comes either from heaven or from hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 237</h4><p>237. Just as loving the Lord and other people makes our life heaven, so selfish and materialistic loves, when they control us, make our life hell, since these two loves are opposed to the other two. So if we are controlled by selfishness and materialism, we cannot accept anything from heaven. What we do accept comes from hell.<p>Everything we love and believe comes either from heaven or from hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 237</h4><p>237. Just as love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour make the life of heaven in a person, so when self-love and love of the world have the mastery, these make the life of hell in him. For these are the opposites of the former loves. As a result those who are mastered by self-love and love of the world cannot receive anything from heaven; what they do receive comes from hell. Whatever a person loves and believes comes either from heaven or from hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 237</h4><p>237. Just as love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour constitute the life of heaven with man, so the love of self and the love of the world, when they are dominant, constitute the life of hell; for the latter loves are opposed to the former loves. Those therefore with whom the loves of self and the are dominant, cannot receive anything from heaven, so that what they receive comes from hell; for whatever a man loves, and whatever he believes, comes either from heaven or from hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 237</h4><p>237. As love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor constitute the life of heaven with man, so the love of self and the love of the world, when they reign, constitute the life of hell with him; for these loves are opposite to those. Therefore they with whom the loves of self and of the world reign, can receive nothing from heaven, but what they receive is from hell; for whatever a man loves, and whatever he believes, is either from heaven or from hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 237 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>237. Quemadmodum amor in Dominum et amor erga proximum faciunt vitam caeli apud hominem, ita amor sui et amor mundi, quando regnant, faciunt vitam inferni apud illum, nam hi amores illis oppositi sunt: quapropter illi apud quos amores sui et mundi regnant, nihil possunt recipere e caelo, sed quae recipiunt sunt ex inferno; quicquid enim homo amat et quicquid credit, vel e caelo est vel ex inferno est. </p>
