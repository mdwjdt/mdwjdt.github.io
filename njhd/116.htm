<h4 align="center"></h4><p>116、相信圣言或教会教义的教导，却不照之生活，看上去好像是信；一些人也断言，他们因这信而得救。但没有人唯独因这信而得救，因为这是说服性的信仰。现在我来描述一下这种信。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>116、相信圣言的教导或者教会的教义，却不按它们去生活，这看上去似乎是信仰，一些人也相信他们这样就得救了。然而真相是无人单凭这种信仰得救，因为这是误导性的信仰，这里讲讲它的特性。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 116</h4><p>116. Believing what the Word or the church teaches and not living by it may look like faith, and some may even conjecture that they are saved by it; but the truth is that no one is saved by faith alone. Faith alone is a conviction one deliberately induces in oneself; <sup>1</sup>therefore I need now to describe the nature of such self-induced convictions. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Latin term here translated "conviction one deliberately induces in oneself" and elsewhere as "self-induced conviction" is <i>fides persuasiva</i>, literally, "persuasive faith. " On this Latin phrase, see note 1 in <a href="49.htm">New Jerusalem 49</a>. [Editors] </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 116</h4><p>116. Believing what the Bible or our religion teaches without living according to it may seem to be faith — and some people think they are saved by this kind of faith. However, this faith does not save anyone by itself. It is a deceptively convincing faith, and I will describe what it is like: </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 116</h4><p>116. Believing what the Word teaches, or the teachings of the church, without living in accordance with them, may look like faith; and there are also some who think that they are saved by it. But no one is saved by that alone, for it is a faith which comes from false belief. I shall now describe this sort of faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 116</h4><p>116. Believing those things which the Word, that is, the doctrine of the Church teaches, and not, at the same time, living according thereto, appears to be faith; some also imagine that they are saved through such a faith; but no one is saved by that faith alone; for it is faith by persuasion, the quality of which shall now be declared. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 116</h4><p>116. To believe those things which the Word teaches, or which the doctrine of the church teaches, and not to live according to them, appears as if it were faith, and some also assert that they are saved by it; but by this alone no one is saved, for it is persuasive faith, the quality of which shall now be stated. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 116 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>116. Credere illa quae docet Verbum, seu quae doctrina ecclesiae, et non vivere secundum illa, apparet sicut sit fides; et quoque autumant quidam quod salventur per illam: sed per illam solam nemo salvatur, est enim fides persuasiva; quae qualis est, nunc dicetur. </p>
