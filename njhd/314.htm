<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 314</h4><p>314. The officials overseeing the arena of our lives that concerns heavenly matters, the ecclesiastical arena, are called priests, and their function is priesthood. The officials overseeing the arena of our lives that concerns worldly matters, the civil arena, are called magistrates, and the highest of them, where such a form of government exists, is the monarch. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 314</h4><p>314. The officials who oversee things in us that have to do with heaven — religious matters — are the clergy. Their job is the ministry. But the officials who oversee the things about us that have to do with the world — political matters — are government officials. In countries with monarchies, the highest of these government officials are kings. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 314</h4><p>314. The governors people have in charge of affairs which relate to heaven, that is, church affairs, are called priests, and their office is the priesthood. But the governors people have in charge of affairs which relate to the world, that is, affairs of state, are called magistrates. The highest of these, where such systems of government exist, is the king. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 314</h4><p>314. Those in authority who are placed over those things among men which belong to heaven, that is, over ecclesiastical things, are called priests; and their office is called the priesthood. But those in authority who are set over those things among men which belong to the world, that is, over civil things, are called magistrates, and their chief, where there are such governments, is called a king. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 314</h4><p>314. Governors over those things with men which relate to heaven, or over ecclesiastical affairs, are called priests, and their office is called the priesthood. But governors over those things with men which relate to the world, or over civil affairs, are called magistrates, and their chief, where such a form of government prevails, is called king. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 314 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>314. Praefecti super illa apud homines quae caeli sunt, seu super ecclesiastica, vocantur sacerdotes; ac munus eorum sacerdotium. Praefecti autem super illa apud homines quae mundi sunt, seu super civilia, vocantur magistratus; ac summus eorum, ubi talia imperia, rex. </p>
