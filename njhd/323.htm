<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 323</h4><p>323. The law that is justice should be enacted in the realm by individuals who are skilled in the law, wise, and God-fearing, and thereafter the monarch and subjects should live by that law. Monarchs who live by the duly enacted law set an example for their subjects by doing so. They are true monarchs. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 323</h4><p>323. People who know the laws well, and who are wise and have a respect for God, should pass just laws for a country. Once they have done this, both the rulers and the citizens should live according to them. Rulers who live according to the laws that have been passed, and in this way set a good example for the citizens, are good rulers. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 323</h4><p>323. The law which is justice ought to be passed by the wise and God-fearing lawyers in the kingdom, and thereafter both the king and his subjects ought to live in accordance with it. A king who lives in accordance with a law that has been passed, and in this sets his subjects an example, is truly king. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 323</h4><p>323. The law which is justice, ought to be enacted in a realm by wise and God-fearing legislators; and both the king and his subjects ought afterwards to live according to it. The king who lives according to the law which has been enacted, and herein sets an example to his subjects, is truly a king. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 323</h4><p>323. The law which is justice ought to be enacted in the realm by persons skilled in the law, wise, and who fear God; then both the king and his subjects ought to live according to it. The king who lives according to the enacted law, and in this precedes his subjects by his example, is truly a king. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 323 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>323. Lex quae justitia a legisperitis sapientibus et timentibus Deum in regno ferenda est, secundum quam dein et rex et subditi vivent: rex qui secundum legem latam vivit, et in eo praecedit subditis exemplo, is vere rex est. </p>
