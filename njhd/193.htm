<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 193</h4><p>193. Since faith is rare these days because there is an absence of caring and the church is at its end, few people nowadays are allowed to undergo spiritual crises. <sup>1</sup>That is why it is scarcely known what they are or what good they do. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Swedenborg elsewhere repeats this assertion that (especially in recent times) few people have been allowed to undergo crises of the spirit. See <i>Secrets of Heaven</i> <a href="../ac/4274.htm">4274[2]</a>, <a href="../ac/8164.htm">8164</a>, <a href="../ac/8965.htm">8965</a>; <i>New Jerusalem</i> <a href="193.htm">193</a>; <i>Revelation Explained</i> (= Swedenborg 1994-1997a) 897:2; <i>True Christianity</i> <a href="../tcr/597.htm">597[2]</a>.

<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 193</h4><p>193. Since there is no kindness these days now that the old religion is coming to its end, faith is very uncommon. Because of this, hardly anyone is allowed to experience spiritual struggles. So we hardly even know what they are and what they are good for. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 193</h4><p>193. Since to-day faith is rare because of the absence of charity, the church being at its end, few people nowadays experience any degree of spiritual temptation. As a result it is hardly known what spiritual temptations are and what purpose they serve. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 193</h4><p>193. Since faith at the present day is rare, because there is no charity - for the church is at its end - therefore there are only a few who are admitted into any spiritual temptations. Hence it is that it is scarcely known what these temptations are, and what their use is. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 193</h4><p>193. Since at this day faith is rare because there is no charity, for the church is at its end, therefore few at this day are admitted into any spiritual temptations; hence it is scarcely known what they are, and to what they are conducive. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 193 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>193. Quoniam hodie fides rara est quia non charitas, est enim ecclesia in suo fine, idcirco pauci hodie in aliquas tentationes spirituales admittuntur: inde est, quod vix sciatur quid sunt et ad quid conducunt. </p>
