<h4 align="center"></h4><p>181、内在人首先被主重生，然后外在人重生，并且后者通过前者重生。因为内在人通过思想那些属于信和仁的事物而重生；而外在人通过照之的生活而重生。这就是主说这句话的意思：</p><p>人若不是从水和灵生的，就不能进神的国。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.5.htm">3:5</a>）</p><p>就灵义而言，“水”表示信之真理，“灵”表示照之的生活。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>181、内在之人首先被主重生，然后是外在之人，外在经由内在重生。因为内在之人的重生经历了思考与信仰和仁爱相关的事物，但是外在之人的重生则是经由相应的生命而实现。主的圣言意指这些：</p><p>人若不是从水和圣灵生的，就不能进神的国。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.5.htm">3:5</a>）</p><p>“水”的灵意是信仰的真理，“圣灵”是依据它的生活。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 181</h4><p>181. First the inner self and then the outer is regenerated by the Lord; and the outer is regenerated by means of the inner. The inner self is regenerated by thinking about what is involved in faith and caring, and the outer is regenerated by a life in accord with this. <p>That is the meaning of the Lord's words: "Unless you have been born of water and the spirit you cannot enter the kingdom of God" (<a href="3927/john_3_5.htm">John 3:5</a>). "Water," spiritually understood, is the truth that belongs to religious faith, and "the spirit" is a life according to that truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 181</h4><p>181. Our inner self is reborn from the Lord first and our outer self is reborn through it afterwards. This is because our inner self is reborn by thinking things that have to do with faith and kindness but our outer self is reborn by a life in harmony with them. This is what the Lord meant when he said, “Unless you have been born from both water and spirit, you cannot enter God’s realm” (<a href="3927/john_3_5.htm">John 3:5</a>). In the spiritual meaning, “water” is the truth that goes with faith, and “spirit” is a life in harmony with it. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 181</h4><p>181. The internal man is first regenerated by the Lord, and the external afterwards, the external by means of the internal. For the internal man is regenerated by thinking the thoughts of faith and charity, but the external by living in accordance with them. This is what is meant by the Lord's words: <p>Unless one is born of water and spirit, one cannot enter the kingdom of God. <a href="3927/john_3_5.htm">John 3:5</a>. <p>Water in the spiritual sense means the truth of faith, and spirit means living in accordance with it. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 181</h4><p>181. The internal man is regenerated first by the Lord, and the external afterwards, and the latter through the former; for the internal man is regenerated by thinking those things which belong to faith and charity; but the external, by a life in accordance therewith. This is meant by the Lord's words (<a href="3927/john_3_5.htm">John 3:5</a>), "Except a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God;" water, in the spiritual sense, means the truth of faith, and Spirit a life in accordance therewith. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 181</h4><p>181. The internal man is first regenerated by the Lord, and afterwards the external, and the latter by means of the former. For the internal man is regenerated by thinking those things which are of faith and charity, but the external by a life according to them. This is meant by the words of the Lord:<p>Unless anyone be begotten of water and the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God (<a href="3927/john_3_5.htm">John 3:5</a>).<p>"Water," in the spiritual sense, is the truth of faith, and "the spirit" is a life according to it. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 181 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>181. Internus homo primum regeneratur a Domino, et postea externus, et hic per illum: internus enim homo regeneratur per cogitare illa quae fidei et charitatis sunt, externus autem per vitam secundum illa. Hoc intelligitur per Domini verba,<p>"Nisi quis generatus fuerit ex aqua et spiritu, non potest ingredi in regnum Dei" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_181/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_3_5" target=_top>Johannes 3:5</a>):<p>"aqua" in spirituali sensu est verum fidei, et "spiritus" est vita secundum illud. </p>
