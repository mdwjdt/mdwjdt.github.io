<h4 align="center"></h4><p>226、生命的这种延续就是复活的意思。人们之所以相信在最后审判之前，他们不会复活，到那时，整个可见的世界必都毁灭，是因为他们不明白圣言；还因为感官人将生命局限于肉体，以为除非这肉体再次获得生命，否则一个人不可能有未来，也就是说，一切就都结束了。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 226</h4><p>226. This continuation of our life is what is meant by "the resurrection. " The reason people believe that they will not be resurrected until the Last Judgment, when the whole visible world is allegedly going to perish, is that they have not understood the Word. It is also because sense-oriented people locate life in the body and believe that unless their bodies are revived it will be all over for them. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 226</h4><p>226. This continued life is what rising from death means. Because people misunderstood the Bible, they believed we would not rise from death until the Last Judgment, when the entire visible world would disappear. Since sense-oriented people believe their body is what is alive, they think that if our body did not come back to life, we would be finished. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 226</h4><p>226. This continuation of life is what is meant by resurrection. The reason people believe that they will not rise again before the Last Judgment, when the whole of the visible world will be destroyed, is due to failure to understand the Word. It is also because people who rely on the senses restrict life to the body, and believe that, unless this comes to life again, a person can have no future. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 226</h4><p>226. This continuance of life is what is meant by the resurrection. The reason why men believe that they are not to rise again before the Last Judgment, when also the whole visible world shall perish, is, that they did not understand the Word; and that sensual men place life in the body, believing that unless this should receive life again, it would be all over with a man. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 226</h4><p>226. This continuation of life is meant by the resurrection. The reason why men believe that they will not rise again before the Last Judgment, when the whole visible world will perish, is because they have not understood the Word, and because sensual men place all their life in the body, and believe that unless this shall live again, it will be all over with the man. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 226 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>226. Haec continuatio vitae est quae intelligitur per resurrectionem. Quod homines credant quod non prius resurrecturi sint quam ultimo judicio, quando etiam periturum omne aspectabile mundi, est quia non intellexerunt Verbum; et quia sensuales homines vitam ponunt in corpore, et credunt quod nisi hoc revicturum esset, actum foret de homine. </p>
