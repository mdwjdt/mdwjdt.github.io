<h4 align="center"></h4><p>67、之所以说为了他自己和自己的小圈子，是因为爱自己的人也爱自己的小圈子，尤其是自己的子孙，以及总体上所有与他构成一体的人，就是他所说的自己人。爱这些人也是爱他自己，因为可以说他在自己里面看到他们，在他们里面看到自己。所有赞美和崇敬他们，并向他们献殷勤的人也在他所说的自己人之列。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>67、当提到“自己人或自己的小圈子”时，这里的意思是，当人爱自己时，他也爱他的孩子和亲属，以及所有和他结为一伙的人。总的说来就是他的自己人。爱这些人也就是爱他自己，因为他视他们为自己的一部分，他自己也是他们的一部分。他称为“自己人”的，也包括一切赞扬、尊敬和谄媚他的人。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 67</h4><p>67. In referring to "ourselves and our immediate circle," I mean that when we love ourselves we also love those we see as our own, in particular our children and grandchildren, and in general everyone with whom we identify, whom we call "ours. " Loving them is loving ourselves. This is because we see them as virtually part of us and see ourselves in them. Also included in those we call "ours" is everyone who praises, honors, and reveres us. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 67</h4><p>67. I say “for the sake of ourselves and our family” because if we love ourselves, we also love our family. The people we think of as our family are our children and grandchildren, and in general, anyone who agrees with us. Loving these people is also loving ourselves, since we consider them to be an extension of ourselves, and we see ourselves in them. We think of anyone who praises, respects, and admires us as part of our family, too. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 67</h4><p>67. I say, for the sake of himself and his people, because one who loves himself also loves the people who belong to him, in particular his children and grandchildren, and in general all who act in concert with him, and whom he calls his own. Loving these two groups of people is also loving oneself, for one looks upon them as if part of one, and oneself as part of them. Among those called his own are also included all who praise, honour and pay respect to him. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 67</h4><p>67. It is said, for the sake of himself, and for the sake of those who belong to him, because whoever loves himself, loves also those who belong to him; by whom are meant here, in particular, children and grand-children, and, in general, all who make one with himself, and whom he calls his own. Loving these is the same as loving one's self; for a man beholds them, as it were, in himself, and himself in them. Among those whom such a man calls his own, are also all those by whom he is flattered, honoured, and worshipped. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 67</h4><p>67. It is said for the sake of himself and his own, because he who loves himself also loves his own, who are, in particular, his children and relations, and in general, all who make one with him, and whom he calls his own. To love these is also to love himself, for he regards them as it were in himself, and himself in them. Among those whom he calls his own, are also all they who praise, honor, and pay their court to him. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 67 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>67. Propter semet et suos, dicitur; nam qui amat se etiam amat suos, qui sunt in specie liberi et nepotes ejus, et in genere omnes qui unum cum illo faciunt, quos suos vocat; hos et illos amare est quoque se amare nam illos spectat quasi in se, et se in illis: inter illos quos suos vocat, sunt quoque omnes qui eum laudant, honorant et colunt. </p>
