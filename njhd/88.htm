<h4 align="center"></h4><p>88、综上所述，明显可知，最广义上讲，良善才是邻舍，因为人照着他从主所获得的良善的性质而为邻舍。由于良善才是邻舍，所以爱也是邻舍，因为一切良善皆属于爱。这意味着每个人都照着他从主所获得的爱的性质而为邻舍。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>88、从上述描述显而易见，在普遍意义上，良善本身就是友邻，因为人成为友邻依据的是他具有的、从主而来的良善特性。进而，由于良善是人的友邻，所以爱也是，因为人所做的一切良善都发自爱。这意味着，任何人都可以依据他从主接受的爱的特性，而成为友邻。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 88</h4><p>88. We can see from what has been said thus far that in the broadest sense goodness itself is one's neighbor, since people are neighbors according to the nature of the good that they do, which they get from the Lord. Further, since goodness is one's neighbor, love too is one's neighbor, because everything good that we do is inspired by love. This means that any individual is a neighbor according to the nature of her or his love, which comes from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 88</h4><p>88. We can see from what I have said that goodness is our friend in the broadest sense, since people are our friends according to the kind of good qualities they have from the Lord. And since goodness is our friend, love is our friend, because all goodness comes from love. So people are our friends according to the kind of love they have from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 88</h4><p>88. From what has been said it is now plain that in a universal sense the neighbour is good, because a person is the neighbour in accordance with the nature of the good he has from the Lord. Because the neighbour is good, so also he is love, for all good is concerned with love. So each person is the neighbour in accordance with the nature of the love he has from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 88</h4><p>88. From what has now been said, it is plain that in a universal sense, good is the neighbour; since a man is a neighbour according to the quality of the good which is with him from the Lord. And inasmuch as good is the neighbour, so also is love, for all good belongs to love; wherefore, also, every man is a neighbour according to the quality of the love which he has from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 88</h4><p>88. It is plain from what has now been said, that in the universal sense, good is the neighbor, because man is the neighbor according to the quality of the good that is with him from the Lord. And because good is the neighbor, so is love, for all good is of love; thus every man is the neighbor according to the quality of the love which he receives from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 88 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>88. Ex dictis nunc patet quod in universali sensu bonum sit proximus, quia homo est proximus secundum quale boni quod a Domino apud illum. Et quia bonum est proximus, est amor, nam omne bonum est amoris; ita quisque homo est proximus secundum quale amoris qui ei est a Domino. </p>
