<h4 align="center"></h4><p>3、由于该天堂由自主降世至今所有这样的人构成，故可推知，它既由基督徒，也由外邦人或异教徒构成。不过，自主降世以来全世界所有夭折的婴孩占的比例最大。因为所有这些婴孩都被主接纳，在天堂被抚养长大，并由天使来教导；他们被安全保守，以便能与其他人一起构成新天堂。由此可以断定新天堂何等庞大。所有夭折的小孩子都在天堂被抚养长大，接受教育，并成为天使，这一点可见于《天堂与地狱》一书（<a href="../hh/329.htm">329</a>-<a href="../hh/345.htm">345</a>节）；新天堂既由基督徒，也由外邦人或异教徒构成（<a href="../hh/318.htm">318</a>-<a href="../hh/328.htm">328</a>节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 3</h4><p>3. Since this heaven was formed out of all such individuals from the Lord's time <sup>1</sup>to the present, we can be sure that it is made up of both Christians and non-Christians. <sup>2</sup>The largest portion, though, consists of all the little children from the whole world who have died since the time of the Lord. All of them, you see, have been adopted by the Lord, raised in heaven, and taught by angels. They have been kept safe so that they could be part of the new heaven along with others. We can therefore determine how vast this heaven is. You may see in <i>Heaven and Hell</i> <a href="../hh/329.htm">329-345</a> that all little children who die are raised in heaven and become angels, and from <a href="../hh/318.htm">318-328</a> that heaven is formed just as much from non-Christians as from Christians. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"From the Lord's time" means since the lifetime of Jesus. Compare the note in <a href="1.htm">1:2</a>, on "the Lord. " [Editors]<p>2.&nbsp;The Latin word here translated "non-Christians" is a form of the noun <i>gentes</i>, which generally refers to "peoples" or "nations," but has a special sense in Christian contexts. Though in <i>Heaven and Hell</i> <a href="../hh/308.htm">308</a>this word is defined simply as "people who are outside the church, where the Word is not found," in Swedenborg's usage in general the word is a relative term, not an absolute designation; it identifies which people in a discussion have, by implicit contrast, a <i>lesser</i> access to the Word than another given group. It may arise out of Swedenborg's concept of <i>ecclesia</i> (the church), which he defines as "where the Word exists and the Lord is known by means of it" ( <i>New Jerusalem</i> <a href="246.htm">246</a>; compare <i>Sacred Scripture</i> <a href="../ss/104.htm">104</a>). In this sense, the <i>gentes</i> are those who are, relatively speaking, less a part of the church because they know less about the Christian God. This explains why in <i>Secrets of Heaven</i> <a href="../ac/367.htm">367</a> the term clearly retains its New Testament sense of "Gentiles" (that is, non-Jews) in contrast to Jews, while in <a href="../hh/516.htm">Heaven and Hell 516</a> it means certain unspecified non-Christians in contrast to Muslims. A relevant parallel can be found in the Qur'an, which speaks of the "People of the Book," meaning "those who have the Torah or the Gospel. " [DNG, GFD] </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 3</h4><p>3. Since the new heaven was formed out of everyone who had lived a life of faith and kindness, from the time the Lord lived on earth right up to the present, it is obvious that both Christians and non-Christians are part of it. But the greater part of it comes from all the children in the world who have died since the Lord’s time. These children have all been welcomed by the Lord, brought up in heaven, taught by angels, and then kept safe so they could be a part of the new heaven with the rest. So we can imagine how big this heaven is. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 3</h4><p>3. Since this heaven has been formed from all who were such as described, from the time of the Lord down to the present, it is clear that it is composed as much of non-Christians as of Christians. For the greater part it is composed of all the children throughout the world, who have died since the Lord's time; for all of these have been taken in by the Lord and brought up in heaven. They have been taught by angels, and then kept so as to constitute together with the rest the new heaven. That will give some idea how large that heaven is. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 3</h4><p>3. Since this heaven was formed of all who had been of such a character, from the time of the Lord even to the present time, it is evident that it consists of Christians as well as of Gentiles, but for the most part of the children of all in the whole world, who have departed this life since the Lord's time: for these have all been received by the Lord, educated in heaven, and instructed by the angels, and afterwards preserved, so that together with the rest, they might constitute the New Heaven. From this it may be concluded how vast that heaven is. That all who die as children, are educated in heaven, and become angels, may be seen in the work on <a href="../hh/329.htm">Heaven and Hell 329-345</a>. And that heaven is formed of Gentiles as well as of Christians, <a href="../hh/318.htm">Heaven and Hell 318-328</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 3</h4><p>3. Since this heaven was formed of all those who had been such from the coming of the Lord until the present time, it follows that it is composed both of Christians and of Gentiles; but chiefly of all infants from the whole world, who have died since the Lord's coming; for all these were received by the Lord, and educated in heaven, and instructed by the angels, and reserved, that they, together with the others, might constitute the New Heaven; whence it may be concluded how great that heaven is. That all who die in infancy are educated in heaven, and become angels, may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell (n. <a href="../hh/329.htm">329-345</a>). And that heaven is formed of Gentiles as well as of Christians (n. <a href="../hh/318.htm">318-328</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 3 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>3. Quia hoc caelum formatum est ab omnibus qui tales fuerunt, usque a tempore Domini ad praesens tempus, constat quod tam a Christianis quam a gentibus; sed quoad maximam partem ab omnium infantibus in universo terrarum orbe qui obiverunt a tempore Domini, nam hi omnes recepti sunt a Domino, et educati in caelo, ac instructi ab angelis, et dein conservati, ut novum caelum una cum reliquis constituerent: inde concludi potest quam magnum est id caelum. (Quod omnes qui infantes moriuntur, educentur in caelo, et fiant angeli, videatur in opere <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_3/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_329" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 329-345</a>: et quod caelum formetur aeque a gentibus quam a Christianis, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_3/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_318" target=_top>De Caelo et Inferno 318-328</a>.) </p>
