<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 283</h4><p>283. This means that people within the church who do not acknowledge the Lord and his divine nature cannot be joined to God, and therefore their portion will not be among angels in heaven. You see, no one can be joined to God except by the Lord and in the Lord. <p>The Lord teaches in John that no one can be joined to God except by the Lord:<p>No one has ever seen God. The only-begotten Son, who is close to the Father's heart, has made him visible. (<a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>)<p>Again,<p>You have never heard the Father's voice or seen what he looks like. (<a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>)<p>Again,<p>No one knows the Father except the Son, and those to whom the Son wills to reveal him. (<a href="3927/matthew_11_27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>)<p>And again,<p>I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>)<p>The reason no one can be joined to God except in the Lord is that the Father is in him and they are one, as he teaches us, again in John:<p>If you know me you also know my Father. Those who see me see the Father. Philip, do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. (<a href="3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7-11</a>)<p>And again,<p>The Father and I are one. . . . [Believe in my works,] so that you may know and believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. (<a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_38.htm">38</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 283</h4><p>283. Because of this, Christians who do not accept the Lord and his divinity can have no connection with God, which means they cannot be together with the angels in heaven. The only way we can be united with God is if the union comes from the Lord and is in the Lord.<p>The Lord taught in John that no one can be united with God except through the Lord: “No one has ever seen God. His only Son, who is close to God’s heart, has made him known” (<a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>).<p>Also in John:<p>“You have never heard the Father’s voice or seen his face” (<a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>).<p>In Matthew:<p>“No one knows the Father except the Son and those people whom the Son wants to show him to” (<a href="3927/matthew_11_27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>).<p>In John:<p>“I am the path, the truth, and the life. The only way you can reach the Father is through me” (<a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p>We can only be united with God through the Lord because the Father is in him, and they are one person — as he teaches in John:<p>If you had known me, you would also have known my Father.... Anyone who sees me, sees the Father. Philip, don’t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? . . . Believe me, I am in the Father, and the Father is in me. (<a href="3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7-11</a>)<p>Also in John:<p>The Father and I are one person.... This is so that you can know and believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me.

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 283</h4><p>283. Those therefore within the church who do not acknowledge the Lord and His divinity cannot be linked with God, and so cannot have any part with the angels in heaven. For no one can be linked with God except by the Lord and in the Lord. The Lord teaches in John that no one can be linked with God except by the Lord: <p>No one has ever seen God. The only-begotten Son, who is in the Father's bosom, he has revealed him. <a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>. <p>In the same book: <p>You have never heard the Father's voice, nor have you seen his appearance. <a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>. <p>In Matthew: <p>No one knows the Father except the Son, and he to whom the Son has chosen to reveal him. <a href="3927/matthew_11_27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>. <p>And in John: <p>I am the way, truth and life. No one comes to the Father except through me. <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>. <p>The reason why no one can be linked with God except in the Lord is that the Father is in Him, and they are one, as He also teaches in John: <p>If you know me, you also know my Father.

Those, therefore, who within the Church do not acknowledge the Lord and His Divine, cannot be conjoined with God, and thus they cannot have any lot in common with the angels in heaven for no one can be conjoined with God except from the Lord, and in the Lord. That no one can be conjoined with God except from the Lord, the Lord teaches in <a href="3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>, "No man hath ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath manifested Him." Again, "Ye have neither heard the voice of the Father at any time, nor seen His shape" (<a href="3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>). Again, in <a href="3927/matthew_11_27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>, "No man knoweth the Father, save the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him," And again, in <a href="3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>, "I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life: no man cometh unto the Father but by Me." The reason why no one can be conjoined to God except in the Lord, is that the Father is in Him, and they are One; as He teaches, in <a href="3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7-11</a>, "If ye had known Me, ye should have known my Father also. He that seeth Me, seeth the Father. Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? " And again, "The Father and I are One. That ye may know and believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me" (<a href="3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>, <a href="3927/john_10_38.htm">38</a>). </p>
