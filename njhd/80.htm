<h4 align="center"></h4><p>80、人若要知道何为邪恶，就应当知道它们的起源；若不知道何为邪恶，就不可能知道何为良善，因而不可能知道他自己是何性质。这就是此处论述邪恶的这两种起源的原因。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>80、若想知道邪恶是什么，就必须知道它来自哪里。除非知道邪恶是什麽，就不知道何为良善，因而也不知道我们自己的本性如何，所以需要在此讨论邪恶的这两种源头。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 80</h4><p>80. If we are to know what evil is we need to know where it comes from; and unless we know what evil is we do not know what goodness is and therefore cannot know what we ourselves really are. That is the reason for dealing here with these two sources of evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 80</h4><p>80. To know what is evil, we have to know where evil comes from. And unless we know this, we cannot know what is good, which means we cannot know what goodness is like. That is why I wrote this chapter about these two sources of evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 80</h4><p>80. For a person to know his evils, he must know their sources; and unless he knows his evils, he cannot know the kinds of good he has, so he cannot know what sort of person he is. That is why those two sources of evils have been discussed here. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 80</h4><p>80. In order that a man may know evils, he ought to know their origins; and unless he knows evils, he cannot know what goods are; thus neither can he know his own quality. This is the reason that those two origins of evils have here been treated of. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 80</h4><p>80. In order that man may know evils, he ought to know their origins, and unless he knows evils, he cannot know goods, thus he cannot know of what quality he himself is: this is the reason that these two origins of evils are treated of here. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 80 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>80. Ut homo sciat mala, scire debet origines illorum; et nisi sciat mala, non scire potest bona, ita non potest scire qualis est. Inde est quod de binis illis originibus malorum hic actum sit. </p>
