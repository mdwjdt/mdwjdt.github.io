<h4 align="center"></h4><p>157、思想并相信那些行善的人会上天堂，以及人要行善，以便上天堂，不算视回报为目的，因而不算将功德置于行为之中。因为甚至那些从主行善的人也如此思想并相信。但那些如此思想、相信并实行，却不是为了良善而爱良善的人则视回报为目的，他们将功德置于行为之中。</p><p>《属天的奥秘》摘录</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>157、人若在践行良善时思考并相信，如此行就配得进入天堂，或者他为了进天堂而行善，这样的人不同于为回报而行善，或把善行的荣耀归给自己之人。因为靠主行善的人也这样思考和相信。但人若在如此思考、相信和行动中，不是因为良善的缘故而热爱良善，他就实在是注重回报和追求荣耀了。</p><p>摘自《属天的奥秘》</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 157</h4><p>157. Thinking and believing that we come into heaven if we do what is good and that we are to do what is good in order to get into heaven is not the same as focusing on a reward as our goal or taking credit for our deeds, since people who do good things that come from the Lord have this thought and belief. However, if we think, believe, and act like this but do not love doing good for its own sake, then we are indeed focusing on reward and seeking credit. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 157</h4><p>157. If we think and believe that people who do good things will go to heaven, and that we should do good things so that we will go to heaven, that is not making reward our goal or taking credit for what we do. People who do good things from the Lord think and believe that way. However, if we think, believe, and do things in order to get to heaven, but do not love goodness because it is good, then we do want a reward, and we do take credit for our actions. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 157</h4><p>157. Thinking and believing that those who do good go to heaven, and also that one ought to do good so as to go to heaven, is not looking on reward as an end, and so regarding deeds as meritorious. For those too who do good from the Lord think and believe this. But it is those who think, believe and do this without loving good for good's sake who look on it as a reward and regard deeds as meritorious. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 157</h4><p>157. Thinking and believing that those come into heaven who do good, and also that good ought to be done, in order that any one may enter heaven, does not mean having respect to reward as an end; and therefore, it does not mean placing merit in works; for even those who do good from the Lord both think and believe so: but those who think, believe, and do so, and who are not in the love of good for the sake of good, have respect to reward as an end, and they place merit in works. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 157</h4><p>157. To think and believe that they who do good will come into heaven, and also that good is to be done in order that they may come into heaven, is not to regard reward as an end, thus neither is it to place merit in works; for even they who do good from the Lord think and believe so, but they who thus think, believe and do, and are not in the love of good for the sake of good, have regard to reward as an end, and place merit in works. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 157 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>157. Cogitare et credere quod in caelum veniant qui bonum faciunt, et quoque quod bonum faciendum sit ut in caelum veniant, non est spectare mercedem ut finem, ita nec ponere meritum in operibus, nam id cogitant et credunt etiam illi qui bonum faciunt a Domino; sed qui ita cogitant, credunt et faciunt, et non in amore boni propter bonum sunt, illi spectant et ponunt. </p>
