<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 275</h4><p>275. It is important to know that there is divine providence and there is also divine foresight. <sup>1</sup>Goodness is what the Lord provides, and evil is what the Lord foresees. Both foresight and providence are necessary, because what comes from us is nothing but evil and what comes from the Lord is nothing but good. <p>From Secrets of Heaven<p>Since everything good that the Lord provides us flows in, I need to include in what follows citations from Secrets of Heaven concerning inflow; and since everything that the Lord provides he provides in accordance with the divine design, I need also to cite passages from the same source concerning the divine design. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Latin words here translated "providence" and "foresight" are <i>providentia</i> and <i>praevidentia</i>-a play on words that is difficult to convey in English. [GFD] </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 275</h4><p>275. You should realize that some things are provided, and others are foreseen. The Lord provides for good things but foresees harmful things. The two have to be together, since everything that comes from ourselves is completely harmful but everything that comes from the Lord is completely good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 275</h4><p>275. It needs to be known that there is providence and foresight. Good is what is provided by the Lord, evil is what is foreseen by the Lord. One has to be accompanied by the other. For what comes from human beings is nothing but evil, and what comes from the Lord is nothing but good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 275</h4><p>275. It is to be borne in mind, that there are Providence and Foresight. Good is what is provided by the Lord, but evil what is foreseen by Him. The one must be together with the other; for what comes from man is nothing but evil, but what comes from the Lord is nothing but good. <p>From THE HEAVENLY ARCANA. <p>Since all the good which is provided by the Lord for man flows in, therefore in what follows there shall also be adduced from the Heavenly Arcana what is stated there concerning Influx: and since the Lord provides all things according to Divine Order, there shall likewise be adduced what is stated there concerning Order. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 275</h4><p>275. It is to be known that there is providence, and there is foresight; good is what is provided by the Lord, but evil is what is foreseen by the Lord. The one must accompany the other, for what comes from man is nothing but evil, but what comes from the Lord is nothing but good.<p>FROM THE ARCANA COELESTIA<p>Since all the good which is provided for man by the Lord flows in, we will therefore adduce from the Arcana Coelestia the particulars there concerning Influx: and since the Lord provides all things according to Divine order, we will also adduce from that work the particulars concerning Order. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 275 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>275. Sciendum est quod sit providentia et praevidentia; bonum est quod a Domino providetur, malum autem est quod a Domino praevidetur: una cum altera erit; nam quod ab homine venit non est nisi quam malum, at quod a Domino non est nisi quam bonum.<p>(EX ARCANIS CAELESTIBUS.)<p>Quoniam omne bonum, quod providetur homini a Domino, influit, ideo quoque in sequentibus afferenda sunt ex Arcanis Caelestibus quae ibi de Influxu: et quia Dominus omnia providet secundum Divinum ordinem, ideo etiam afferenda sunt quae ibi de Ordine. </p>
