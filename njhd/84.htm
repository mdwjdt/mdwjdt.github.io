<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">六、爱邻或仁爱</h4 ><p>84、首先需要给邻舍下个定义，因为我们要爱的是邻舍，仁爱所施予的对象也是邻舍。除非知道何为邻舍，否则，我们只会以同样的方式实施仁爱，不加区别，向恶人和向善人一样行善。但在这种情况下，仁爱不再是仁爱，因为恶人会利用慈善行为向邻舍作恶，而善人则利用慈善行为向邻舍行善。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第六章　爱友邻，或仁爱</h4><p>84、首先需要解释什么是友邻，因为友邻是爱的对象，施予仁慈的对象。除非知道友邻的含意，否则仁爱可能会无差别地，同等地施予恶人和善人，结果仁慈会走向反面。因为虽然善者会使用所得帮助对友邻践行良善，恶者却会用来施行伤害。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 84</h4><p>84. Love for Our Neighbor, or Caring<p>First of all, I need to define neighbor, because this is the one we are to love and the one toward whom caring is to be extended. Unless we know what neighbor means, we may extend caring in basically the same manner indiscriminately-just as much to evil people as to good ones. But in that case our caring can become the opposite of caring, because although the good people will use what they have been given to do good to their neighbor, the evil people will use it to do harm. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 84</h4><p>84. Chapter 6. Loving Other People, or Kindness<p>First I will explain what it is in other people that we are meant to love and show kindness to. Unless we know this, we might show kindness to harmful people in the same way we show it to good people. Then our kindness would not really be kindness, since harmful people use anything good done for them to hurt others, but good people use it to help others. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 84</h4><p>84. VI. ON LOVE TOWARDS THE NEIGHBOUR, THAT IS, CHARITY <p>I shall start by defining the neighbour, for it is he who is to be loved and towards whom charity is to be exercised. Without knowing what the neighbour means charity may be exercised in like measure without distinction, equally towards the evil as the good. Charity thus becomes no charity. For the evil harm the neighbour by the benefits they confer, but the good do good by them. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 84</h4><p>84. LOVE TOWARDS THE NEIGHBOUR, OR, CHARITY. <p>IT shall first be stated what is meant by "neighbour;" for it is he who is to be loved, and towards whom charity is to be exercised. For unless it is known what is meant by a neighbour, charity may be practised indiscriminately and in like manner towards the evil and the good, whereby charity becomes no charity; inasmuch as the evil, by the benefits received, do evil to the neighbour, but the good do good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 84</h4><p>84. VI. LOVE TOWARDS THE NEIGHBOR, OR CHARITY<p>It shall first be shown what the neighbor is, for it is the neighbor who is to be loved, and towards whom charity is to be exercised. For unless it be known what the neighbor is, charity may be exercised in a similar manner, without distinction, towards the evil as well as towards the good, whence charity ceases to be charity: for the evil, from benefactions, do evil to the neighbor, but the good do good. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 84 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>84. (VI.) DE AMORE ERGA PROXIMUM, SEU DE CHARITATE.<p>PRIMUM dicetur quid Proximus, ille enim est qui amandus, et erga quem charitas exercenda est: nisi enim scitur quid proximus, charitas potest exerceri simili modo absque distinctione, aeque erga malos quam erga bonos, unde charitas non fit charitas; mali enim ex benefactis malefaciunt proximo, sed boni benefaciunt. </p>
