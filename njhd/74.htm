<h4 align="center"></h4><p>74、由此可知处于自我之爱的人是谁。他们表面是什么样，是傲慢还是谦卑，则无关紧要。因为这些品质在内层人里面；而大多数人的内层是隐藏的，外层则被训练，以便假装热爱公众和邻舍，从而伪装成反面。这样做也是为了他自己，因为他知道，对公众和邻舍的爱会从内在感动所有人，这会使他被喜爱和尊重。这爱之所以感动所有人，是因为天堂流入它里面。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>74、至此，我们可以知道那些主导欲为爱自己的人的特征了。这种鉴别并不依据他们外在表现看上去如何，是傲慢还是谦卑。上述的特征存在于人的内在。大多数人的内在是隐藏着的，而其外在经训练后，会假装喜爱做有益于公众和友邻的事情，这与他们的内在正好相反。他们这样做还有一个私心：他们知道爱民众和爱他人的榜样人物，会深深地感动大众，他们会因此被爱戴，并获得与其付出的爱相应的尊重。那样的行为能感动大众是因为天堂流入那爱里。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 74</h4><p>74. So these points can help us recognize the characteristics of people who devote their lives to self-love, but this recognition does not depend on how they appear outwardly, whether they come across as proud or submissive. The characteristics mentioned above are in the inner self, and for most people their inner self is hidden away and their outer self is trained to pretend to love the public good and their neighbors-the very opposite of what is inside. This too is for selfish reasons. They know that everyone is deeply moved by examples of a love for the public good and for one's neighbor and that they themselves will be loved and valued to the extent that they exhibit this love. (The reason everyone is moved by such things is that heaven flows into that kind of love.) </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 74</h4><p>74. From all this we can understand who is selfish. It does not matter whether someone appears conceited or self-effacing outwardly. Our selfishness is in our inner self, which we hide from most people. Our outer self learns to pretend to love other people and the common good, but inside we are just the opposite. We do this for our own advantage, knowing that love for other people and the common good deeply touches people, and that the more they see this love in us, the more they will love and appreciate us. It touches people because heaven flows into this kind of love. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 74</h4><p>74. These remarks now make it possible to recognise who the people are who are in a state of self-love. It makes no difference what they are like to outward appearance, whether they are proud or submissive. For the qualities meant are in the inward man, and most people keep their inward man concealed, while the outward man is trained to put on a pretence of loving the general public and the neighbour, so as to seem the opposite of what he is. This too is for his own sake. For they know that loving the public and the neighbour makes a deep impression on everybody, and that is what makes them liked and esteemed so much. This impression is due to the inflow from heaven into that love. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 74</h4><p>74. From this it is now known who are in the love of self. Still it does not depend upon their appearance in outward form, whether they are haughty or meek; for the qualities mentioned are in the interior man, and by most persons the interior man is concealed, and the exterior man is trained to counterfeit the things belonging to love of the common weal and the neighbour; and thus to put on the opposite things. This also they do for the sake of self; for they are aware that loving the common weal and the neighbour interiorly affects all, and that they are loved and esteemed in the same proportion; the reason why it affects is that heaven flows into such love. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 74</h4><p>74. From these things it is now known who are in the love of self. But it matters not how they appear in outward form, whether elated or humble; for such things are in the interior man; and by most the interior man is concealed, and the exterior is instructed to feign the things which belong to love for the public and the neighbor, thus the opposite. And this is also done for the sake of self: for they know that the love of the public and the neighbor interiorly affect all, and that so far they will be loved and esteemed. The reason why that love affects all, is because heaven flows into it. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 74 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>74. Ex his nunc cognoscitur quinam in amore sui sunt. Sed non refert qualiter apparent in externa forma, si vel elati vel submissi; nam talia sunt in interiori homine, et interior homo a plerisque occultatur, ac exterior instruitur mentiri illa quae amoris publici et proximi sunt, ita contraria; et hoc quoque propter se: sciunt enim quod amare publicum et proximum interius afficiat omnes, et quod tantum amentur et aestimentur; quod afficiat, est quia caelum in illum amorem influit. </p>
