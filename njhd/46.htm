<h4 align="center"></h4><p>46、前面所论述的内在和外在是指人之灵的内在和外在；他的身体不过是一个附加的外在，或一个壳而已；灵的内在和外在就住在这身体里面。因为身体凭自己什么也做不了，而是受住在它里面的灵支配。要知道，一个人的灵在离开身体后会继续思考和意愿，说话和行动。思考和意愿是它的内在，说话和行动是它的外在。关于这个主题，可参看《天堂与地狱》一书（<a href="../hh/234.htm">234</a>-<a href="../hh/245.htm">245</a>，<a href="../hh/265.htm">265</a>-<a href="../hh/275.htm">275</a>，<a href="../hh/432.htm">432</a>-<a href="../hh/444.htm">444</a>，<a href="../hh/453.htm">453</a>-<a href="../hh/484.htm">484</a>节）。</p><p>《属天的奥秘》摘录</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>46、上述探讨的内在和外在是指人灵性的内在和外在。他的躯体只是一个壳，供内在和外在居住。躯体自己不能做任何事情，而是它里面的灵通过它在做。众所周知，人的灵魂与躯体分离后，它仍然像从前一样思考和意愿、行动和说话。进行思考和意志的是它的内在，说话和行动的是它的外在。相关内容参阅《天堂与地狱》（<a href="../hh/234.htm">234</a>-<a href="../hh/245.htm">245</a>，<a href="../hh/265.htm">265</a>-<a href="../hh/275.htm">275</a>，<a href="../hh/432.htm">432</a>-<a href="../hh/444.htm">444</a>，<a href="../hh/453.htm">453</a>-<a href="../hh/484.htm">484</a>）。</p><p>摘自《属天的奥秘》</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 46</h4><p>46. The inner and outer levels we have been dealing with are the inner and outer levels of our spirit. Our bodies are nothing but a shell in which these inner and outer levels reside. That is, the body does nothing on its own, acting only from the spirit that is within it. <p>Bear in mind that after it is released from the body our spirit keeps right on thinking and intending and speaking and acting. Its thinking and intending constitute the inner level of our spirit, while its speaking and acting constitute its outer level. In this connection, see <a href="../hh/234.htm">Heaven and Hell 234-245</a>, <a href="../hh/265.htm">265-275</a>, <a href="../hh/432.htm">432-444</a>, <a href="../hh/453.htm">453-484</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 46</h4><p>46. The inner and outer parts I am talking about are the inner and outer parts of our spirit. The body is just an extra outer part added on, in which the other two exist. The body does not do anything by itself; everything it does comes from the spirit inside it. We should realize that after it is freed from the body, our spirit thinks, wants, says, and does things just the same as it did before. Thinking and motivation are the spirit’s inner part, and speech and action are its outer part. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 46</h4><p>46. The internal and external, about which I have written, are the internal and external of a person's spirit. His body is merely an extra external, within which the internal and external of the spirit come into existence. For the body does nothing of itself, but is directed by the spirit which resides in it. It should be known that a person's spirit after being released from the body is just as much able to think and will, speak and act. Thinking and willing are its internal, speaking and acting are its external. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 46</h4><p>46. The Internal and External, which have been treated of, are the Internal and External of man's spirit; his body is merely a superadded External, within which those exist; for the body does nothing of itself, but from its spirit which is in it. It is to be observed, that a man's spirit, after separation from the body, continues to think and will, to speak and act: thinking and willing is his Internal, and speaking and acting his External; on this subject, see the work on <a href="../hh/234.htm">Heaven and Hell 234-245</a>, <a href="../hh/265.htm">265-275</a>, <a href="../hh/432.htm">432-444</a>, <a href="../hh/453.htm">453-484</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 46</h4><p>46. The internal and the external, which have been treated of, are the internal and the external of the spirit of man; his body is only a superadded external, within which they exist; for the body does nothing from itself, but from its spirit which is in it. It is to be known that the spirit of man, after its separation from the body, thinks and wills, speaks and acts, the same as before; to think and to will is its internal, and to speak and to act is its external; concerning which, see in the work on Heaven (n. <a href="../hh/234.htm">234-245</a>, <a href="../hh/265.htm">265-275</a>, <a href="../hh/432.htm">432-444</a>, <a href="../hh/453.htm">453-484</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 46 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>46. Internum et externum, de quibus actum est, est internum et externum spiritus hominis; corpus ejus est modo externum superadditum, intra quod illa existunt: corpus enim nihil ex se agit, sed ex suo spiritu qui in illo. Sciendum est quod spiritus hominis post solutionem a corpore aeque cogitet et velit, ac loquatur et faciat; cogitare et velle est ejus internum, ac loqui et facere est ejus externum (De quo videatur in opere De Caelo (et Inferno), <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_46/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_234" target=_top>234-245</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_46/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_265" target=_top>265-275</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_46/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_432" target=_top>432-444</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_46/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_453" target=_top>453-484</a>.) </p>
