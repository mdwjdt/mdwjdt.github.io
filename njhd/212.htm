<h4 align="center"></h4><p>212、就灵义而言，主的“身体”或“肉”，以及“饼”，都表示爱之良善；主的“血”和“酒”都表示信之良善；“吃”表示变成人自己的和结合。与参加圣餐礼的人同在的天使们只以这种方式理解这些词，因为他们以属灵的方式感知一切事物。正因如此，那时，爱的神圣和信的神圣从伴随的天使，因而从主经由天堂流入人；这会带来结合。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>212、在属灵含义里，主的“身体”或“肉体”，以及“面饼”，表示爱的良善；主的“血”和“酒”表示信仰的良善；“吃”意味使这样的良善成为我们自己的并因之使我们与主联合。与参加圣餐礼的人同在的天使们就是这样理解的，因为他们在灵性里知觉一切事物。因此，那时圣爱与圣信通过天使流入人里面，因此是从主流经天堂而来，所以联合得以实现。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 212</h4><p>212. In the spiritual meaning, the Lord's body or flesh, like the bread, is the goodness of love, and the Lord's blood, like the wine, is the goodness of faith, while eating is our making these kinds of goodness our own and becoming joined to the Lord by them. This is how the angels who are with us when we are taking the Holy Supper understand it, because they perceive everything spiritually. Therefore holy love and holy faith flow into us from the angels-that is, through heaven from the Lord-at that time, and this brings about the partnership. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 212</h4><p>212. In that meaning, the Lord’s body, or flesh, symbolizes the goodness that comes from love. Bread means the same thing. The Lord’s blood is the goodness that comes from faith. Wine means the same thing. Eating them is making them a part of ourselves and uniting them with ourselves.<p>This is how the angels who are with us when we go to the holy supper understand it, since they understand everything spiritually. So the sacredness of love and faith flow into us from these angels, which means it is flowing through heaven from the Lord. This is how the union takes place. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 212</h4><p>212. In that sense the Lord's body or flesh is the good of love, and bread is the same. The Lord's blood is the good of faith, and wine is the same. Eating is making one's own and being linked. The angels who attend upon a person taking the sacrament of the Lord's Supper understand these words in this way only, for they perceive everything in a spiritual way. As a result the holiness of love and the holiness of faith then flow in from the attendant angels, so through heaven from the Lord; this brings about linking. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 212</h4><p>212. In the spiritual sense, the Lord's body or flesh, and in like manner the bread, denotes the good of love; and the Lord's blood, and in like manner the wine, denotes the good of faith; and eating, appropriation and conjunction. The angels who are with a person who partakes of the sacrament of the Supper, do not understand these things otherwise; for they perceive all things spiritually. Hence it is, that the holiness of love and the holiness of faith then flows in with a man from the angels, and thus through heaven from the Lord; conjunction results thence. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 212</h4><p>212. In the spiritual sense, the Lord's "body" or "flesh," and the "bread," signifies the good of love; and the Lord's "blood" and the "wine," the good of faith; and "eating" is appropriation and conjunction. The angels who are with the man who goes to the Sacrament of the Supper, understand those things in no other way, for they perceive all things spiritually. Hence it is, that the holiness of love and the holiness of faith then flow into man from the angels, thus through heaven from the Lord, and hence conjunction is effected. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 212 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>212. In illo sensu "corpus" aut "caro" Domini est bonum amoris, similiter "panis;" ac "sanguis" Domini est bonum fidei, similiter "vinum;" ac "manducatio" est appropriatio et conjunctio. Angeli, qui sunt apud hominem qui obit Sacramentum Cenae, non aliter intelligunt illa, spiritualiter enim percipiunt omnia; inde est quod sanctum amoris et sanctum fidei influat tunc ab angelis apud hominem, ita per caelum a Domino; inde conjunctio. </p>
