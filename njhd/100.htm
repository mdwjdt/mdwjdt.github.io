<h4 align="center"></h4><p>100、许多人以为，爱邻舍在于施舍穷人，帮助贫乏人，向每个人行善。然而，仁爱在于谨慎行事，目的是为了使良善能由此产生。凡帮助一个穷困或贫乏的作恶者之人都是在通过作恶者而向邻舍行恶，因为他所提供的帮助会让作恶者去行更多的恶，给他们提供更多害人的资源。当他给予善人帮助时，情况则不然。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>100、很多人相信，爱友邻在于施救贫穷，扶危助困，广行善事。其实仁爱在于克己慎行，促使导出良善。 人若救助陷于危难或贫困中的恶者，实际上就是由着他对友邻行恶。因为所提供的帮助，会成全恶人做更多的恶事，为他提供更多害人的手段。对良善之人提供救助则情况相反。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 100</h4><p>100. Many people believe that love for their neighbor is giving to the poor, providing means to the needy, and doing good to just anyone. In fact, true caring is acting prudently and with the intent that some good will come of it. If we provide resources to evildoers who are poor or needy, we are doing harm to our neighbors through the resources we provide, because those resources will empower the evildoers to do more evil and supply them with greater means of harming others. The situation is the opposite when we provide resources to good people. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 100</h4><p>100. Many people think loving other people means giving to poor people, supporting people who do not have enough to get by, and doing good things for everyone we come across. But kindness is doing things sensibly so that good will come from them. If we support poor and deprived people who are wrongdoers, we are harming other people through them. The help we give them only supports them in their harmful actions: it supplies them with what they need to hurt other people. It is different when we come to the aid of good people. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 100</h4><p>100. Many people believe that love towards the neighbour consists in giving to the poor, bringing help to the needy, and doing good to everyone. But charity consists in acting prudently, and with the intention that good may come of it. If anyone gives help to a poor or needy wrongdoer, he does harm to the neighbour through him. For the help he gives strengthens him in evil and supplies him with the resources to do harm to others. The opposite is the case if he gives help to the good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 100</h4><p>100. It is believed by many that love towards the neighbour consists in giving to the poor, assisting the needy, and doing good to every one. Charity, however, consists in acting with prudence, and for the sake of the end that good may result from it. Whoever assists a poor or needy evil-doer, does evil through him to his neighbour; for through the help which he affords to him he confirms him in evil, and supplies him with the means whereby to do evil to others. It is different with those who lend assistance to the good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 100</h4><p>100. It is believed by many, that love towards the neighbor consists in giving to the poor, in assisting the indigent, and in doing good to everyone; but charity consists in acting prudently, and to the end that good may result. He who assists a poor or indigent evil doer does evil to the neighbor through him, for through the assistance which he renders, he confirms him in evil, and supplies him with the means of doing evil to others. It is otherwise with him who gives support to the good. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 100 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>100. Creditur a multis quod amor erga proximum sit dare pauperibus, opem ferre indigenti, et bonum facere cuicunque; sed charitas est prudenter agere, et propter finem ut inde bonum Qui alicui pauperi aut indigenti malefico opem fert, is per illum malefacit proximo; nam per opem, quam fert, confirmat illum in malo, ac suppeditat ei copiam malefaciendi aliis. Aliter qui suppetias fert bonis. </p>
