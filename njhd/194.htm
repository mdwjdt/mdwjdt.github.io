<h4 align="center"></h4><p>194、试探有助于良善征服邪恶，真理征服虚假；还有助于强化真理，并把它们与良善结合在一起，同时驱散邪恶和确认它们的虚假。试探也有助于打开内在属灵人，使外在属世人服从它，同时破碎对自己和世界的爱，并驯服由此而来的欲望。当这一切发生时，人就获得光照和洞察，明白什么是真理和良善，什么是虚假和邪恶。他由此获得以后会逐日增加的聪明和智慧。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>194、试探有助于良善取得对邪恶的主宰，使真理获得对谬误的主宰；还会强化真理，使真理与良善相结合，同时粉碎邪恶及其所生之谬误；试探还使内在属灵之人开悟，使外在属世之人降伏于他；同时克服爱自己和爱世界，并克制从它们而来的贪恋。这些经历使人获得觉悟和洞察，明白什么是真理和良善，以及什么是谬误和邪恶。由此人得到才智和智慧，并与日俱增。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 194</h4><p>194. Crises of the spirit help goodness in us gain control over evil and truth gain control over falsity. They help reinforce truths and join them to goodness and at the same time shatter evils and the falsities that arise from them. They also serve to open our inner, spiritual self and bring our earthly self under its control, break up our love for ourselves and for the world, and tame the cravings that arise from them. <p>Once this has been done, we come into enlightenment and gain a perception of what is true and what is good, and of what is false and what is evil. This gives us intelligence and wisdom, which then keep growing day by day. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 194</h4><p>194. Inner struggles help our good traits and true ideas to get control over our bad traits and false ideas. They strengthen the truth in us and unite it with our good parts. At the same time, they get rid of our faults and the wrong ideas that come from them. They help open up our inner spiritual self, and put our material self under its control. They also help us to overcome our selfishness and materialism, and to control the cravings that come from them.<p>When we have done these things, we gain enlightenment and intuition about what is good and true and about what is false and harmful. So we become understanding and wise, and this grows in us every day. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 194</h4><p>194. Temptations serve to win for good mastery over evil and for truth mastery over falsity. They also serve to strengthen truths, and to join them to good qualities, while at the same time dispelling evils and the falsities that confirm them. They also serve to open up the internal spiritual man, and to make the natural man subject to him; also, to break down self-love and the love of the world, and to tame the longings which arise from this. When all this has happened a person gains enlightenment and a perception of what truth and good are, and what falsity and evil are. Thus he acquires intelligence and wisdom which thereafter go on increasing day by day. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 194</h4><p>194. Temptations are of use in acquiring dominion for good over evil, and for truth over falsity; and further, in confirming truths, and in conjoining them with good, and at the same time in dispersing evils, and hence falsities. They are of use also in opening the internal spiritual man, and in subjecting the natural man to it: and at the same time in breaking the loves of self and of the world, and in restraining the lusts which are therefrom. After these things have been brought about, the man obtains enlightenment and a perception of what truth and good, and falsity and evil are. This is the occasion of intelligence and wisdom for man, which afterwards, increase from day to day. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 194</h4><p>194. Temptations conduce to acquire for good dominion over evil, and for truth dominion over falsity; also to confirm truths, and conjoin them to goods, and at the same time to disperse evils and the falsities thence derived. They serve also to open the internal spiritual man, and to subject the natural man to it; as also to break the loves of self and the world, and to subdue the lusts which proceed from them. When these things are effected, man acquires enlightenment and perception as to what are truth and good, and what falsity and evil are; whence man obtains intelligence and wisdom, which afterwards increase continually. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 194 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>194. Tentationes conducunt ad acquirendum dominium bono super malum ac vero super falsum; tum ad confirmanda vera, et ad conjungenda illa bonis, et simul ad discutienda mala et inde falsa: conducunt etiam ad aperiendum internum spiritualem hominem, et ad ei subjiciendum naturalem; tum quoque ad infringendum amores sui et mundi, et ad domandum concupiscentias quae inde sunt. Quibus factis, homini fit illustratio et perceptio quid verum et bonum, et quid falsum et malum; inde fit homini intelligentia et sapientia, quae postea indies crescunt. </p>
