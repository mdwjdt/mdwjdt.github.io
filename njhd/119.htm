<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 119</h4><p>119. The following passage in Matthew is about people whose faith is self-induced:<p>On that day many will say to me, "Lord, Lord, haven't we prophesied in your name, cast out demons in your name, and done many great things in your name?" But then I will declare to them, "I do not know you, you workers of iniquity. " (<a href="3927/matthew_7_22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_7_23.htm">23</a>)<p>Then it says in Luke:<p>Then you begin to say, "We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets. " But he will say, "I tell you, I do not know where you are from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity. " (<a href="3927/luke_13_26.htm">Luke 13:26</a>, <a href="3927/luke_13_27.htm">27</a>)<p>They are also described as the five foolish young women in Matthew who did not have oil for their lamps:<p>Later the other young women came along and said, "Lord, Lord, open up for us. " But he will answer and say, "I tell you truly, I do not know you. " (<a href="3927/matthew_25_11.htm">Matthew 25:11</a>, <a href="3927/matthew_25_12.htm">12</a>)<p>The oil [that should have been] in their lamps means the good actions from love [that should be] in our faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 119</h4><p>119. This passage from Matthew refers to people who are caught up in a deceptively convincing faith:<p>On that day, many people will say to me, “Lord, Lord, haven’t we prophesied in your name, thrown demons out in your name, and done many powerful things in your name?”<p>But I will tell them, “I do not recognize you, . . . you people who practice oppression.” (<a href="3927/matthew_7_22.htm">Matthew 7:22-23</a>)<p>And in Luke:<p>Then you will start saying, “We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.”<p>But he will say, “I tell you, I do not know where you came from. Get away from me, all you people who practice oppression!” (<a href="3927/luke_13_26.htm">Luke 13:26-27</a>)<p>This is also the meaning of the five foolish virgins in Matthew who did not have oil in their lamps:<p>Finally, those virgins will come and say, “Lord, Lord, open the door for us!”<p>But he will answer them, “I tell you the truth: I do not recognize you.” (<a href="3927/matthew_25_11.htm">Matthew 25:11-12</a>)<p>“Having oil in their lamps” means having the goodness that comes from love within their faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 119</h4><p>119. It is those whose faith is from false belief who are meant by these in Matthew: <p>Many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name, and cast out devils in your name, and done many mighty deeds in your name? But then I shall admit to them, I do not know you, workers of iniquity. <a href="3927/matthew_7_22.htm">Matthew 7:22-23</a>. <p>Also in Luke: <p>Then you will begin to say, We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets. But he will say, I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all workers of iniquity. <a href="3927/luke_13_26.htm">Luke 13:26-27</a>. <p>These are also they who are meant by the five foolish virgins in Matthew, who had no oil in their lamps: <p>Finally, those virgins came saying, Lord, Lord, open up for us. But he will say in reply, Truly I tell you, I do not know you. <a href="3927/matthew_25_11.htm">Matthew 25:11-12</a>. <p>Oil in lamps stands for the good of love in faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 119</h4><p>119. Those who are in faith by persuasion are meant by those described in <a href="3927/matthew_7_22.htm">Matthew 7:22-23</a>, "Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy by Thy name, and by Thy name cast out demons, and by Thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from Me, ye that work iniquity." Again, in <a href="3927/luke_13_26.htm">Luke 13:26-27</a>, "Then shall ye begin to say, We did eat before Thee, and drink, and Thou didst teach in our streets. But He shall say, I tell you, I know not whence ye are; depart from Me, all ye workers of iniquity." These persons are also meant by the five foolish virgins who had no oil in their lamps, in <a href="3927/matthew_25_11.htm">Matthew 25:11-12</a>, "At length came the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But He answered and said, Verily, I say unto you, I know you not." Oil in lamps signifies the good of love in faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 119</h4><p>119. They who are in persuasive faith are meant by these in Matthew:<p>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied by Thy name, and by Thy name cast out demons, and in Thy name done many virtues? But then I will confess to them, I have not known you, ye workers of iniquity (<a href="3927/matthew_7_22.htm">7:22, 23</a>).<p>Also in Luke:<p>Then will ye begin to say, We have eaten before Thee, and have drunk, and Thou hast taught in our streets; but He will say, I say to you, I have not known you whence you are; depart from Me all ye workers of iniquity (<a href="3927/luke_13_26.htm">13:26, 27</a>).<p>They are meant also by the five foolish virgins who had no oil in their lamps, in Matthew:<p>At length came those virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; but He answering will say, Verily I say unto you, I have not known you (<a href="3927/matthew_25_11.htm">Matt. 25:11, 12</a>).<p>"The oil in the lamps" is the good of love in faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 119 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>119. Illi qui in fide persuasiva sunt, intelliguntur per hos apud Matthaeum,<p>"Multi dicent mihi in die illo, Domine, Domine, nonne per nomen tuum prophetavimus, et per nomen tuum daemonia ejecimus, et in nomine tuo multas virtutes fecimus? Sed tunc confitebor illis, Non novi vos, ...operarii iniquitatis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_7_22-23" target=_top>Matthaeum 7:22-23</a>);<p>Tum apud Lucam,<p>"Tunc incipietis dicere, Edimus coram te, et bibimus, et in plateis nostris docuisti; sed dicet, Dico vobis, Non novi vos unde estis; discedite a Me, omnes operarii iniquitatis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_13_26-27" target=_top>Lucas 13:26-27</a>):<p>Intelliguntur etiam per quinque virgines stultas, quae non habebant oleum in lampadibus apud Matthaeum,<p>"Tandem..venerunt illae virgines, dicentes, Domine, Domine, aperi nobis; ille vero respondens dicet, Amen, dico vobis, non novi vos" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_119/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_25_11-12" target=_top>Matthaeum 25:11-12</a>):<p>"oleum in lampadibus" est bonum amoris in fide. </p>
