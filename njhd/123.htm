<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">八、虔诚</h4 ><p>123、许多人以为，属灵的生活，或通往天堂的生活在于虔诚，在于外在的神圣，并抛弃世界。但没有仁爱的虔诚，没有内在神圣的外在神圣，没有世间生活的抛弃世界，并不构成属灵的生活。相反，出于仁爱的虔诚，出于内在神圣的外在神圣，与世间生活结合的抛弃世界才构成属灵的生活。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第八章　虔诚</h4><p>123、很多人相信属灵生活，或者通向天堂的生活在于虔诚，在于外在圣洁和超尘脱俗。但是，没有仁爱的虔诚，没有内在圣洁的外在圣洁，没有世间生活的超尘脱俗，这些不构成属灵生活。但是，来自仁爱的虔诚，来自内在圣洁的外在圣洁，活在世间却不沾染尘俗，这才是真正的属灵生活。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 123</h4><p>123. Piety<p>Many people think that a spiritual life, the kind of life that leads us to heaven, consists of piety, of outward holiness, and of renunciation of the world. In fact, though, piety without caring, outward holiness without inner holiness, and renunciation of the world without involvement in the world do not make our life spiritual. What does make our life spiritual is piety that comes from a caring heart, outward holiness that is a manifestation of inner holiness, and renunciation of the world that goes along with involvement in the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 123</h4><p>123. Chapter 8. Religious Devotion<p>Many people think that a spiritual life — which is the way to heaven — means religious devotion, outward holiness, and breaking our attachments to material things. But religious devotion without kindness is not a spiritual life. Nor is outward holiness without inward holiness. Nor does the spiritual life consist of breaking our attachments to material things by detaching ourselves from the material world. Spiritual life is a genuine religious devotion that comes from kindness, an outward holiness that comes from inward holiness, and a breaking of our attachments to material things while still being involved in the material world. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 123</h4><p>123. VIII. ON PIETY <p>Many people believe that a spiritual life, a life which leads to heaven, consists in piety, keeping a holy external appearance and renouncing the world. But piety without charity, and a holy external without a holy internal, and the renunciation of the world without living like this in the world do not make up a spiritual life. What do make it up are piety inspired by charity, a holy external inspired by a holy internal, and the renunciation of the world combined with living like this in the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 123</h4><p>123. PIETY. <p>MANY believe that spiritual life, that is, the life which leads to heaven, consists in piety, in outward holiness, and in renouncing the world. Yet piety apart from charity, outward holiness apart from inward holiness, and renouncing the world apart from a life in the world, do not constitute spiritual life; but it is constituted by piety flowing from charity; by outward holiness flowing from inward holiness; and by renouncing the world coupled with a life in the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 123</h4><p>123. VIII. PIETY.<p>It is believed by many, that spiritual life, or the life which leads to heaven, consists in piety, in external sanctity, and in the renunciation of the world; but piety without charity, and external sanctity without internal sanctity, and a renunciation of the world without a life in the world, do not constitute spiritual life; but piety from charity, external sanctity from internal sanctity, and a renunciation of the world with a life in the world, constitute it. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 123 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>123. (VIII.) DE PIETATE.<p> <p>CREDITUR a multis quod vita spiritualis, seu vita quae ducit ad caelum, consistat in pietate, in sancto externo, et in abdicatione mundi; sed pietas absque charitate, et sanctum externum absque sancto interno, et abdicatio mundi absque vita in mundo, non faciunt vitam spiritualem; verum pietas ex charitate, sanctum externum ex sancto interno, et abdicatio mundi cum vita in mundo, faciunt. </p>
