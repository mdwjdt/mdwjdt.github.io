<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 11</h4><p>11. Goodness and Truth<p>All things in the universe that are in accord with the divine design <sup>1</sup>go back to goodness and truth. There are no exceptions to this in heaven or in the world, because everything good, like everything true, comes from the Divine, which is the source of everything. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The phrase "the divine design" (the Latin term used here is <i>Divinus ordo</i>, literally, "divine order") refers to a divinely ordained arrangement of things in relation to each other both in physical space (or spiritual state) and in physical time (or spiritual sequence). On humans as images of the divine design, see note 4 in <a href="../lj/9.htm">Last Judgment 9</a>. On the similar phrase "the design of heaven," see note 1 in <a href="../eu/51.htm">Other Planets 51</a>. [JSR] </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 11</h4><p>11. Part I: Our Inner Structure.<p>Chapter 1. Goodness and Truth<p>Everything in the universe that is in harmony with the divine plan relates to goodness and truth. Goodness and truth come from the divine, which is the source of everything. This means there cannot be anything in heaven or on earth that does not relate to these two things. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 11</h4><p>11. I. ON GOOD AND TRUTH <p>All things in the universe, which are in accordance with God's order, have reference to good and truth. Nothing exists in heaven, and nothing on earth, which does not have reference to these two. The reason is that both, good as well as truth, proceed from the Deity who is the source of all things. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 11</h4><p>11. GOOD AND TRUTH. <p>ALL things in the universe, which are according to Divine order, have relation to good and truth. There is nothing in heaven or in the world which has not relation to these two; the reason is, that both good and truth proceed from the Divine, from which are all things. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 11</h4><p>11. I. GOOD AND TRUTH.<p>All things in the universe, which are according to Divine order, have relation to good and truth. There is nothing in heaven, and nothing in the world, which has not relation to these two; the reason is, because both good and truth proceed from the Divine from Whom all things are. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 11 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>11. (I.) DE BONO ET VERO.<p>OMNIA in universo, quae sunt secundum Divinum ordinem, se referunt ad bonum et verum; nihil datur in caelo, et nihil in mundo, quod non ad duo illa se refert: causa est, quia utrumque, tam bonum quam verum, procedit a Divino, a quo omnia. </p>
