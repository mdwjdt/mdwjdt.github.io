<h4 align="center"></h4><p>142、自由行恶看似自由，实际上却是奴役，因为这种自由是由爱自己和爱世界产生的，而这些爱来自地狱。死后，这种自由会实际转变为奴役，因为那时，沉溺于这种自由的人会成为地狱里的低贱奴隶。但自由行善构成自由本身，因为它来自爱主和爱邻，这些爱来自天堂。死后，这种自由也会保留下来，那时会变成真自由，因为拥有这种自由的人在天堂变得像家里的儿子。主以这些话教导了这一点：</p><p>凡犯罪的都是罪的奴仆。奴仆不能永远住在家里，儿子是永远住在家里。所以儿子若叫你们自由，你们就真自由了。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.34.htm">8:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.36.htm">36</a>）</p><p>由于一切良善皆来自主，一切邪恶皆来自地狱，所以可推知，自由在于被主引导，努力在于被地狱引导。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 142</h4><p>142. Doing evil freely seems to be a kind of freedom but it is actually slavery, since this freedom comes from our love for ourselves and our love for this world, and these loves come from hell. This kind of freedom actually turns into slavery after we die, since anyone who had this kind of freedom becomes a lowly slave in hell afterward. <p>In contrast, freely doing what is good is freedom itself because it comes from a love for the Lord and from a love for our neighbor, and these loves come from heaven. This freedom too stays with us after death and then becomes true freedom because anyone who has this kind of freedom is like one of the family in heaven. This is how the Lord expresses it: "Anyone who commits sin is a slave of sin. A slave does not abide in the house forever, but the Son does abide forever. If the Son makes you free, you will be truly free" (<a href="3927/john_8_34.htm">John 8:34</a>, <a href="3927/john_8_35.htm">35</a>, <a href="3927/john_8_36.htm">36</a>). <p>Since everything good comes from the Lord and everything evil from hell, it follows that it is freedom to be led by the Lord and it is slavery to be led by hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 142</h4><p>142. Doing harmful things in freedom seems to be freedom, but it is actually slavery. It comes from selfish and materialistic loves, which come from hell. This “freedom” actually turns into slavery after death, since people who had this kind of freedom become worthless slaves in hell.<p>But doing good things out of freedom actually is freedom. It is loving the Lord and loving other people, and these loves come from heaven. This freedom stays with us after death and becomes true freedom. When we have this freedom, we become like the son of a household. This is what the Lord taught:<p>People who live out their faults become a slave to their faults. A slave does not stay in the household forever, but the son does stay in the household forever. If the Son sets you free, you really will be free. (<a href="3927/john_8_34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>)<p>Since everything good comes from the Lord, and everything harmful comes from hell, it follows that freedom is being guided by the Lord, and slavery is being guided by hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 142</h4><p>142. Doing evil by free choice looks like freedom, but it is slavery, because that freedom comes of self-love and love of the world, and these loves are from hell. Such freedom is after death actually turned into slavery, for a person who indulged in such freedom then becomes in hell a lowly slave. <p>But doing good by free choice is real freedom, because it comes of love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour, and these loves are from heaven. This freedom also lasts after death, and then becomes true freedom; for a person who enjoys such freedom becomes in heaven as it were a son of the house. This the Lord teaches in these words: <p>Everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin. A slave does not remain in the house for ever; the son remains for ever. If the son makes you free, you will be truly free. <a href="3927/john_8_34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>. <p>Now because all good is from the Lord, and all evil is from hell, it follows that freedom is being led by the Lord and slavery is being led by hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 142</h4><p>142. Doing evil from freedom appears like freedom, when yet it is bondage, because it is the freedom which arises from the love of self and the love of the world, and these loves are from hell. After death, such freedom also is actually turned into bondage, for then the man who has been in such freedom, becomes in hell a base slave. But doing good from freedom constitutes freedom itself, because it proceeds from love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour, and these loves are from heaven. This freedom also remains after death, and then becomes real freedom; for the man who has possessed it becomes in heaven like a son of the house. This the Lord teaches in what follows (<a href="3927/john_8_34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>), "Whosoever committeth sin is the bond-servant of sin. And the bond-servant abideth not in the house for ever; the Son abideth for ever. If, therefore, the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed." Now, because all good is from the Lord, and all evil from hell, it follows, that freedom consists in being led by the Lord, and bondage in being led by hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 142</h4><p>142. To do evil from freedom, appears as freedom, but it is slavery, because that freedom is from the love of self and from the love of the world, and these loves are from hell. Such freedom is actually turned into slavery after death, for the man who has been in such freedom then becomes a vile servant in hell. But to do good from freedom is freedom itself, because it is from love to the Lord and from love towards the neighbor, and these loves are from heaven. This freedom also remains after death, and then becomes freedom indeed, for the man who has been in such freedom, becomes in heaven like a son of the house. This the Lord thus teaches:<p>Everyone that doeth sin is the servant of sin; the servant abideth not in the house forever: the son abideth forever; if the Son shall have made you free, you shall be truly free (<a href="3927/john_8_34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>).<p>Now, because all good is from the Lord, and all evil from hell, it follows that freedom consists in being led by the Lord, and slavery is being led by hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 142 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>142. Facere ex libero malum apparet ut liberum, sed est servum, quia id liberum est ex amore sui et ex amore mundi, et hi amores sunt ex inferno: tale liberum etiam vertitur actualiter in servum post mortem; nam homo cui tale liberum fuit, fit tunc in inferno vilis servus. At facere ex libero bonum est ipsum liberum, quia est ex amore in Dominum et ex amore erga proximum, et hi amores sunt ex caelo. Hoc liberum etiam manet post mortem, et fit tunc vere liberum; nam homo cui tale liberum fuit, fit in caelo sicut filius domus. Hoc ita Dominus docet,<p>"Omnis faciens peccatum, servus est peccati. Servus..non manet in domo in perpetuum; filius manet in perpetuum. Si..Filius vos liberos fecerit, vere liberi eritis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_142/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_8_34-36" target=_top>Johannes 8:34-36</a>).<p>Nunc quia omne bonum est a Domino, et omne malum ab inferno, sequitur quod liberum sit duci a Domino, ac servum duci ab inferno. </p>
