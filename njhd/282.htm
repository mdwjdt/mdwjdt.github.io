<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 282</h4><p>282. Those born within the Christian church should acknowledge the Lord, his divine nature, and his human nature and believe in him and love him, because all salvation comes from the Lord. That is what the Lord tells us in John:<p>Those who believe in the Son have eternal life. Those who do not believe in the Son will not see life; instead, the wrath of God abides on them. (<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>)<p>And in the same Gospel,<p>This is the will of the one who sent me, that all those who see the Son and believe in him will have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day. (<a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>)<p>And again,<p>Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life. Even if they die, those who believe in me will live; and anyone who lives and believes in me will never die. " (<a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25</a>, <a href="3927/john_11_26.htm">26</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 282</h4><p>282. If we are born Christian, we should accept the Lord — both his divinity and his humanity — and believe in him and love him, since all spiritual well-being comes from the Lord. The Lord taught this in John:<p>People who believe in the Son will live forever. People who do not believe in the Son will not see life. God’s anger will stay in them. (<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>)<p>Also in John:<p>The one who sent me wants everyone who sees the Son and believes in him to live forever, and he will bring them back to life on the last day. (<a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>)<p>And in the same book:<p>Jesus said, “I am the one who raises you from death, and I am life. If you believe in me, even though you die, you will still live. Everyone who lives and believes in me will never die to all eternity.” (<a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 282</h4><p>282. Those who have been born within the church ought to acknowledge the Lord, His divinity and His humanity, and believe in Him and love Him. For all salvation is from the Lord. This is what the Lord teaches in John: <p>He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; he, however, who does not believe the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains with him. <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>. <p>In the same book: <p>This is the will of him who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him should have everlasting life, and I shall raise him up on the last day. <a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>. <p>Again: <p>Jesus said, I am the resurrection and life. He who believes in me, though he die, shall live. But everyone who lives and believes in me shall not ever die. <a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 282</h4><p>282. Those who are born within the Church ought to acknowledge the Lord, His Divine and His Human; and they ought to believe in Him, and to love Him; for all salvation is from the Lord. This the Lord teaches in <a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>, "He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth with him." Again, "This is the will of Him that sent Me, that every one that seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, may have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day" (<a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>). And again, "Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in Me, though he should die, yet shall he live; but every one that liveth and believeth in Me shall not die to eternity" (<a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 282</h4><p>282. They who are born within the church ought to acknowledge the Lord, His Divine and His Human, and to believe in Him and love Him; for all salvation is from the Lord. This the Lord teaches in John:<p>He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the anger of God abideth on him (<a href="3927/john_3_36.htm">3:36</a>).<p>Again:<p>This is the will of Him that sent Me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, may have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day (<a href="3927/john_6_40.htm">6:40</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in Me though he die, shall live; but whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall not die to eternity (<a href="3927/john_11_25.htm">11:25, 26</a>). </p>
