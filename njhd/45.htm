<h4 align="center"></h4><p>45、一个内在如此外在，以至于除了眼睛能看见、手能摸到的东西外什么也不信的人，就被称为一个感官人；这是最低级的属世人，他在与教会信仰有关的一切事上都陷入谬论。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>45、感官主义者是这样的：他们的内在特性是如此的外在，于是他只相信眼睛能看到和手能触摸的事物。这是最低层的属世之人，对教会信仰的一切事物都处在谬误之中。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 45</h4><p>45. We refer to people as "sense-oriented" when their inner nature is so external that they cannot believe anything unless they can see it with their own eyes and touch it with their own hands. They have the lowest possible level of earthly human nature and are subject to misconceptions about everything having to do with the faith of the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 45</h4><p>45. We are “sense-oriented” when our inner part is so superficial that we do not believe anything unless we can see it with our own eyes and touch it with our own hands. When we are like this, we are the lowest type of materialist, entangled in fallacies about everything that has to do with religious faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 45</h4><p>45. One whose internal is so external that he believes in nothing but what he can see with his eyes and touch with his hands is termed the dupe of the senses. He is the lowest type of natural man, a prey to fallacies concerning everything to do with the church's faith. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 45</h4><p>45. The man whose Internal is so far external that he believes only in what he can see with his eyes and touch with his hands, is called a sensual man. He is a natural man in the lowest degree: and is in fallacies as to all things belonging to the faith of the Church. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 45</h4><p>45. He whose internal is so far external, that he believes nothing but what he can see with his eyes and touch with his hands, is called a sensual man; this is the lowest natural man, and is in fallacies concerning all the things which are of the faith of the church. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 45 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>45. Sensualis homo dicitur, cujus internum tantum est externum ut nihil credat nisi quod potest oculis videre et manibus tangere: is est infime naturalis homo, et in fallaciis de omnibus quae fidei ecclesiae sunt. </p>
