<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 154</h4><p>154. The Lord himself tells us in Luke that we are not to do good for the sake of reward:<p>If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do the same. Rather, love your enemies, do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; then your reward will be great and you will be children of the Highest. (<a href="3927/luke_6_32.htm">Luke 6:32</a>, <a href="3927/luke_6_33.htm">33</a>, <a href="3927/luke_6_34.htm">34</a>, <a href="3927/luke_6_35.htm">35</a>)<p>The Lord also tells us in John that on our own we cannot do anything good in such a way that it is truly good:<p>People cannot receive anything unless it has been given to them from heaven. (<a href="3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>)<p>And again,<p>Jesus said, "I am the vine; you are the branches. As a branch cannot bear fruit on its own unless it abides on the vine, the same goes for you unless you abide in me. Those who abide in me and in whom I abide bear much fruit, because without me you cannot do anything. " (<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 154</h4><p>154. The Lord taught in Luke that we should not do good things to be repaid:<p>If you love people who love you, what thanks will you get? . . . even lawbreakers do that.... It is better to love your enemies, do good things for them, and lend to them without hoping for anything in return. Then you will get a large repayment, and you will be children of the highest one. (<a href="3927/luke_6_32.htm">Luke 6:32-35</a>)<p>The Lord also taught in John that the good things we do cannot come from ourselves if we want them to be good:<p>We cannot receive anything unless it is given to us from heaven. (<a href="3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>)<p>And in another place:<p>Jesus said, “I am the vine, you are the branches . . . Just as a branch cannot produce fruit by itself unless it remains on the vine, neither can you unless you remain in me.... Anyone who remains in me, and whom I remain in, produces a great deal of fruit. You can do nothing without me.” (<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-8</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 154</h4><p>154. The Lord Himself teaches that good is not to be done for reward, in Luke: <p>If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For sinners do the same. Rather, love your enemies and do good to them, and lend to them expecting nothing in return. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High. <a href="3927/luke_6_32.htm">Luke 6:32-35</a>. <p>The Lord also teaches that a person cannot do good of himself which is real good, in John: <p>A person cannot take anything unless it is given him out of heaven. <a href="3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>. <p>And in another passage: <p>Jesus said, I am the vine, you are the branches. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it remains on the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me. He who remains in me, and I in him, bears much fruit. For you can do nothing except from me. <a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-8</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 154</h4><p>154. That good ought not to be done for the sake of reward, is taught by the Lord Himself in <a href="3927/luke_6_32.htm">Luke 6:32-35</a>, "For if ye love them that love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do the same. But rather love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the sons of the Most High." That from himself no man can do good that is good, the Lord teaches in <a href="3927/john_3_27.htm">John 3:27</a>, "A man can receive, nothing except it be given him from heaven." And again (<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-8</a>), "Jesus said, I am the vine, ye are the branches: as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide in Me. He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for apart from Me ye can do nothing." </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 154</h4><p>154. That good is not to be done for the sake of reward, the Lord Himself teaches in Luke:<p>If ye love those who love you, what grace have you? for sinners do the same; rather love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing; then shall your reward be great, and ye shall be the sons of the Most High (<a href="3927/luke_6_32.htm">6:32-35</a>).<p>That man cannot do good that is good from himself, the Lord also teaches in John:<p>A man cannot take anything unless it be given Him from heaven (<a href="3927/john_3_27.htm">3:27</a>).<p>And in another place:<p>Jesus said, I am the vine, ye are the branches: as the branch cannot bear fruit from itself, unless it shall abide in the vine, so neither can ye unless ye shall abide in Me: He who abideth in Me and I in him, he beareth much fruit, for except from Me ye cannot do anything (<a href="3927/john_15_4.htm">15:4-8</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 154 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>154. Quod non faciendum sit bonum mercedis causa, docet Ipse Dominus apud Lucam,<p>"Si..Amatis eos qui vos amant, quae vobis gratia est?.... nam..peccatores idem faciunt. ....Potius amate inimicos vestros, et benefacite, atque mutuo date, nihil..sperantes; tunc erit merces vestra magna, et filii Altissimi" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_154/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_6_32-35" target=_top>Lucas 6:32-35</a>).<p>Quod homo non possit facere bonum ex se ut sit bonum, etiam docet Dominus, apud Johannem,<p>"Non potest homo sumere quicquam, nisi sit datum illi e caelo" (iii. 27):<p>et alibi,<p>Jesus dixit, "Ego sum Vitis, vos palmites;"...."sicut palmes non potest ferre fructum a semet, nisi manserit in vite, ita nec vos nisi in Me manseritis:.... <sup id="fn141_1">1</a></sup>qui manet in Me et Ego in illo, is fert fructum multum; nam nisi a Me non potestis facere quicquam" (xv. 4-8).<p>-1 qui pro "Is qui" </p>
