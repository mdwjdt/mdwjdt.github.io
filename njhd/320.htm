<h4 align="center"></h4><p>320、由于国王无法独自管理一切，所以需要有管理者在他之下进行管理。其中每个管理者都被分配一片管理区域，以便他能管理国王的能力或权力达不到的地方。这些管理者合起来构成以国王自己为首的总体管理。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>320、因为国王独自无法治理所有事物，所以在他之下有行政官，每个行政官治理一个地区，那里是国王自己不能独自治理的地区。这些行政官合起来组成王权政府，国王自己居于首位。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 320</h4><p>320. Since the monarch cannot administer everything alone, there need to be officials under him or her, each with a particular area of responsibility that the monarch does not have the skills or the ability to manage. These officials, taken as a whole, are the royal government, but the monarch is the highest among them. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 320</h4><p>320. Since rulers cannot govern all by themselves, they have officials under them, each of whom is given some area to administer that the rulers are not able to take care of themselves. All these officials together form the government, with the ruler at its head. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 320</h4><p>320. Since the king cannot by himself control everything, governors are needed to rule under him. Each of these has an area to control, where the king's ability or power is lacking. These governors taken together make up the total administration, headed by the king himself. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 320</h4><p>320. Since a king cannot administer all things, therefore there are persons in authority under him, to each of whom there is assigned a province, that he may administer what the king is unable and incompetent to do. These persons in authority taken altogether, constitute the regal office, but the king himself is the highest in authority. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 320</h4><p>320. Because the king alone cannot administer all things, therefore there are governors under him, to each of whom a province is given to administer, which the king cannot and is not able to administer alone. These governors, taken together, constitute the royalty, but the king himself is the chief. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 320 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>320. Quia rex non solus potest administrare omnia, ideo sunt praefecti sub illo, quorum unicuivis data est provincia administrandi quod rex non potest et valet. Hi praefecti simul sumpti constituunt regium, sed ipse rex est summus. </p>
