<h4 align="center"></h4><p>294、主自己在约翰福音中教导，祂征服了地狱；当十字架受难即将来临时，耶稣说：</p><p>现在是这世界受审判的时候了，现在这世界的王要被赶出去。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.31.htm">12:31</a>）</p><p></p><p>你们要有信心，我已经胜了世界。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.33.htm">16:33</a>）</p><p>以赛亚书：</p><p>这从以东而来的是谁？能力广大，大步行走，施行拯救。我的膀臂给我带来拯救，这样，祂就作了他们的救主。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.1.htm">63:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.19.htm">19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.16.htm">59:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.21.htm">21</a>） </p><p>主在约翰福音中同样教导，祂荣耀了祂的人身，十字架受难是最后的试探和彻底的胜利，祂以此得了荣耀：</p><p>犹大既出去，耶稣就说，如今人子得了荣耀，神要因自己荣耀人子，并且要快快地荣耀祂。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.31.htm">13:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.32.htm">32</a>）</p><p></p><p>父啊，时辰到了；愿你荣耀你的儿子，使儿子也荣耀你。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.1.htm">17:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p></p><p>现在我的灵魂愁烦。父啊，愿你荣耀你的名。当时就有声音从天上来说，我已经荣耀了它，还要再荣耀。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.27.htm">12:27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.28.htm">28</a>）</p><p>路加福音：</p><p>基督这样受害，又进入祂的荣耀，岂不是应当的吗？（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.26.htm">24:26</a>）</p><p>这些话都是指着主的受难说的。“荣耀”是指成为神性。由此明显可知，若非主降世成为一个人，若非祂以这种方式把所有信祂、爱祂的人从地狱中释放出来，没有人能得救。这就是没有主就没有救恩的意思。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>294、主自己在《约翰福音》中讲授了祂征服地狱的内容。当十字架受难即将来临时，耶稣说：</p><p>现在这世界受审判，这世界的王要被赶出去（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.27.htm">12:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.28.htm">28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.31.htm">31</a>）</p><p>同一部福音书中：但你们要有信心，我已经胜了世界（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.33.htm">16:33</a>）</p><p>在《以赛亚书》中：</p><p>这从以东来的、能力广大、以大能施行拯救的是谁？我自己的膀臂为我施行拯救；这样，他就作了他们的救主（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.1.htm">63:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.19.htm">19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.16.htm">59:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.21.htm">21</a>）。</p><p>关于主荣耀了祂的人身，以及十字架受难是最后的试探和彻底的胜利，借此祂获得了荣耀，主在《约翰福音》中这样教导：</p><p>犹大既出去，耶稣就说，如今人子得了荣耀，神要因自己荣耀人子，并且要快快地荣耀他（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.31.htm">13:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.32.htm">32</a>）。</p><p>同一部福音书中：父啊，时候到了；愿你荣耀你的儿子，使儿子也荣耀你（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.1.htm">17:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.5.htm">5</a>）</p><p>同一部福音书中：我现在心里忧愁。父啊，愿你荣耀你的名。当时就有声音从天上来说，我已经荣耀了我的名，还要再荣耀（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.27.htm">12:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.28.htm">28</a>）。</p><p>在《路加福音》中：基督这样受害，又进入他的荣耀，岂不是应当的吗？（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.26.htm">24:26</a>）</p><p>这些话都与祂的受难有关。“进入荣耀”就是成为神。因此，现在很显然，除非主在尘世出生，成为人，并以这种方式把所有那些信祂、爱祂的人从地狱中解放，否则无人能被拯救。这就是没有主就没有拯救的意思。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 294</h4><p>294. The Lord tells us in John that he gained control over the hells: as his suffering on the cross was impending, Jesus said, "Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out" (<a href="3927/john_12_27.htm">John 12:27</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_28.htm">28</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_31.htm">31</a>); and again, "Take heart! I have overcome the world" (<a href="3927/john_16_33.htm">John 16:33</a>); and in Isaiah, "‘Who is this who is coming from Edom, approaching in the immensity of his strength, and having the power to save?' ‘My own arm brought about salvation for me. ' Therefore he became their Savior" (<a href="3927/isaiah_63_1.htm">Isaiah 63:1-19</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_59_16.htm">59:16-21</a>). <p>He also tells us in John that he glorified his human nature and that the suffering on the cross was his last crisis of the spirit and the complete victory that brought about his glorification:<p>After Judas went out, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Humanity is glorified, and God will glorify him in himself and glorify him immediately. " (<a href="3927/john_13_31.htm">John 13:31</a>, <a href="3927/john_13_32.htm">32</a>)<p>And again,<p>Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, so that your Son may also glorify you. (<a href="3927/john_17_1.htm">John 17:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_5.htm">5</a>)<p>And again,<p>"Now my soul is troubled. Father, glorify your name. " And a voice came from heaven, saying, "I both have glorified it and will glorify it again. " (<a href="3927/john_12_27.htm">John 12:27</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_28.htm">28</a>)<p>Also in Luke,<p>Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer this and enter into his glory? (<a href="3927/luke_24_26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>)<p>He made these statements concerning his suffering on the cross. To "glorify" is to make divine. <sup>1</sup><p>This now shows that unless the Lord had come into the world and become human and in this way had freed from hell all who believe in him and love him, no human being could have been saved. That is how to understand the statement that there is no salvation apart from the Lord [<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_4_12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>]. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;On the two essential meanings of "glorification" in Swedenborg's writings, see note 1 in <a href="185.htm">New Jerusalem 185</a>. [Editors] </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 294</h4><p>294. The Lord taught in John that he brought the hells under control. When it was almost time for the struggle on the cross, Jesus said, “Now comes the verdict on this world. Now the leader of this world will be thrown out” (<a href="3927/john_12_27.htm">John 12:27-28</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_31.htm">31</a>). In the same book he said, “Take heart! I have defeated the world.” (<a href="3927/john_16_33.htm">John 16:33</a>)<p>In Isaiah, it says:<p>Who is this coming from Edom? . . . Striding forward with tremendous strength . . . with great power to set us free.... I saved myself with my own arm.... So he became their liberator. (<a href="3927/isaiah_63_1.htm">Isaiah 63:1-19</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_59_16.htm">59:16-21</a>)<p>In John we are also told that he made his human side divine, and that his struggle on the cross was the last of his inner struggles and gave him a complete victory, which made him Divine:<p>After Judas left, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified . . . and God will glorify him within himself, and will immediately glorify him.” (<a href="3927/john_13_31.htm">John 13:31-32</a>)<p>Also in John:<p>Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, so that your Son can also glorify you. (<a href="3927/john_17_1.htm">John 17:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_5.htm">5</a>)<p>And in the same book:<p>“Now my soul is distressed.... Father, glorify your name.” And a voice came from the sky, “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” (<a href="3927/john_12_27.htm">John 12:27-28</a>)<p>And in Luke he said:<p>Shouldn’t Christ have endured this, to come to his glory? (<a href="3927/luke_24_26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>)<p>These passages refer to his struggle on the cross. “Glorifying him” means making him divine.<p>All this means that no human being could have been set free unless the Lord had come into the world and become human, and in this way freed from hell everyone who believes in him and loves him. That is why there is no spiritual well-being without the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 294</h4><p>294. The Lord teaches in John that He subdued the hells; when the passion on the cross was at hand, Jesus said: <p>Now is the judgment of this world; now the prince of this world will be cast out. <a href="3927/john_12_27.htm">John 12:27-28</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_31.htm">31</a>. <p>In the same book: <p>Be confident, I have defeated the world. <a href="3927/john_16_33.htm">John 16:33</a>. <p>And in Isaiah: <p>Who is this who comes from Edom? Walking in the greatness of his strength, mighty to save. My arm has given me safety, so he became for them a saviour. ; <a href="3927/isaiah_59_16.htm">59:16-21</a>.<p>He also teaches in John that He glorified His humanity and that the passion on the cross was the last temptation and the complete victory by means of which He was glorified: <p>After Judas went out, Jesus said, Now the Son of Man has been glorified. And God will glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him at once. <a href="3927/john_13_31.htm">John 13:31-32</a>. <p>In the same book: <p>Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, so that your Son may also glorify You. <a href="3927/john_17_1.htm">John 17:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_5.htm">5</a>. <p>In the same book: <p>Now my soul is troubled. Father, glorify your name; and a voice came out of heaven, I have glorified it and I shall glorify it again. <a href="3927/john_12_27.htm">John 12:27-28</a>. <p>And in Luke: <p>Ought not Christ to suffer this and to enter into glory? <a href="3927/luke_24_26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>. <p>These sayings relate to His passion; to glorify is to make Divine. These facts now establish that if the Lord had not come into the world and become man, and in this way freed from hell all who believe in Him and love Him, no mortal could have been saved. This is what is meant by there being no salvation without the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 294</h4><p>294. That the Lord subjugated the hells, He Himself teaches in John; when the passion of the cross was at hand, He said, "Now is the judgment of this world; NOW SHALL THE PRINCE OF THIS HIS WORLD BE CAST OUT" (<a href="3927/john_12_31.htm">John 12:31</a>). Again, "Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (<a href="3927/john_16_33.htm">John 16:33</a>). And in , ), "Who is this that cometh from Edom? travelling in the multitude of His strength; mighty to save. Mine own arm brought salvation unto Me. So He became their Saviour." That the Lord glorified His Human, and that the passion of the cross was the last temptation, and complete victory, through which He became glorified, He likewise teaches in <a href="3927/john_13_31.htm">John 13:31-32</a>: "When Judas was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God will glorify Him, in Himself, and will straightway glorify Him." Again "Father the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son also may glorify Thee" (<a href="3927/john_17_1.htm">John 17:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_5.htm">5</a>). And, again, "Now is My soul troubled. Father, glorify Thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again" (<a href="3927/john_12_27.htm">John 12:27-28</a>). And in <a href="3927/luke_24_26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>, Ought not Christ to have suffered this, and to enter into His glory?" These words were spoken of the Lord's passion. To glorify means to make Divine. From this it appears, that unless the Lord had come into the world, and become a man, and unless by this means He had delivered from hell all who believe in Him and love Him, no mortal could have been saved; thus it is to be understood, that without the Lord there is no salvation. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 294</h4><p>294. That the Lord subjugated the hells, He Himself teaches in John: when the passion of the cross was at hand, then Jesus said:<p>Now is the judgment of this world; now the prince of this world shall be cast out (12: <a href="3927/john_12_27.htm">27, 28</a>, <a href="3927/john_12_31.htm">31</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Have confidence, I have overcome the world (<a href="3927/john_16_33.htm">16:33</a>).<p>And in Isaiah:<p>Who is this that cometh from Edom, going on in the multitude of His strength, great to save? My own arm brought salvation to Me; so He became to them for a Saviour (<a href="3927/isaiah_63_1.htm">63:1-19</a>; <a href="3927/isaiah_59_16.htm">59:16-21</a>).<p>That He glorified His Human, and that the passion of the cross was the last temptation and full victory, by which He glorified it, He teaches also in John:<p>After Judas went out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God will glorify Him in Himself, and will immediately glorify Him (<a href="3927/john_13_31.htm">13:31, 32</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Father, the hour has come; glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son also may glorify Thee (17: <a href="3927/john_17_1.htm">1</a>, <a href="3927/john_17_5.htm">5</a>).<p>In the same:<p>Now is my soul troubled; Father, glorify Thy name; and a voice came out from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again (<a href="3927/john_12_27.htm">12:27, 28</a>).<p>And in Luke:<p>Ought not Christ to suffer this, and to enter into His glory? (<a href="3927/luke_24_26.htm">24:26</a>.)<p>These words were said in relation to His passion: "to glorify" is to make Divine. Hence, now, it is manifest, that, unless the Lord had come into the world, and been made Man, and in this manner had liberated from hell all those who believe in Him and love Him, no mortal could be saved; this is understood by the saying, that without the Lord there is no salvation. </p>
