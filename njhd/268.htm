<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 268</h4><p>268. The Lord's divine providence is operative in the smallest details of our lives; <sup>1</sup>there is only one source of life, who is the Lord, and in him we live and move and have our being [<a href="3927/acts-of-the-apostles_17_28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>]. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;Swedenborg here makes an oblique reference to the Enlightenment dispute as to whether divine providence is <i>general</i> or <i>particular</i>, on which see further at note 152. Providence is general when it is seen as a divine power that acts on the universe, or provides for it, on a large scale; it is particular when it acts on the particulars or details of the universe. For example, general providence might be responsible for having set the universe in motion in the beginning; particular providence might be responsible for ensuring that individuals have food to eat on a daily basis, to cite a biblical example (<a href="3927/matthew_6_25.htm">Matthew 6:25-26</a>). Countless passages of the Bible can be cited in support of particular providence, including the statement by Jesus that not even a sparrow falls to the ground without God's will (<a href="3927/matthew_10_29.htm">Matthew 10:29-31</a>). The fathers of the church-especially Augustine-and the later Scholastics thus argued in favor of particular providence; for discussion, see Gilson 1991, 148-167. Swedenborg's view is that in order to act generally, providence must also act on particulars (see, for example, <i>Secrets of Heaven</i> <a href="../ac/4329.htm">4329[4]</a>, <a href="../ac/6482.htm">6482-6483</a>, <a href="../ac/8717.htm">8717:2</a>). Furthermore, particular providence-providence on an individual basis, delivered from the Lord by means of spirits and angels-is necessary to guide those individuals who do not cooperate with general providence ( <i>Secrets of Heaven</i> <a href="../ac/5850.htm">5850</a>). Further discussion by Swedenborg of the topic of providence can be found in many other passages besides the current chapter; some of the most notable are the <i>Secrets of Heaven</i> sections cited in <i>New Jerusalem</i> <a href="276.htm">276</a> and his work Divine Providence.

<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 268</h4><p>268. The Lord’s divine provision deals with every little detail of our lives. This is because there is only one wellspring of life — the Lord — and our existence, life, and actions come from him. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 268</h4><p>268. The Lord's Divine Providence extends to the smallest details of a person's life. For there is only a single source of life, the Lord, from whom we are able to exist, live and act. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 268</h4><p>268. The Lord's Divine Providence extends to the least singulars of a man's life; for there is only One Fountain of Life, which is the Lord, from whom we are, live, and act. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 268</h4><p>268. The Divine Providence of the Lord extends to the most minute things of a man's life; for there is only one fountain of life, which is the Lord, from whom we are, we live, and we act. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 268 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>268. Providentia Divina Domini est quoad singularissima vitae hominis; nam non est nisi quam unicus vitae fons, qui est Dominus, a quo sumus, vivimus, et agimus. </p>
