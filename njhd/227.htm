<h4 align="center"></h4><p>227、人死后的生命是他的爱与信的生命。因此，一个人活在世上时，他的爱与信如何，永远等待着他的生命就如何，或说他活在世上时，其爱与信的性质决定了哪种生命在永远等待着他。等待那些爱自己爱世界高于一切之人的，是地狱的生命；等待那些爱神高于一切，并爱邻如己之人的，是天堂的生命。后者就是那些有信的人，而前者是那些没有信的人。天堂的生命就是那被称为永生的；地狱的生命则是那被称为属灵死亡的。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>227、人死后的生命是他的爱与信的生命。所以人在世时爱与信的状态，决定在永恒里他生命的状态。那些爱自己和世界超过一切的人，他的生命将属地狱；而那些爱神超过一切且爱邻如己的人，其生命属于天堂；后者有信，而前者没有。天国中的生命称为永生，而地狱中的生命称为灵性的死亡。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 227</h4><p>227. Our life after death is the life of our love and our faith, so the kind of love and faith we have when we live in this world determines the kind of life that will be ours to eternity. It is a life of hell for people who have loved themselves and the world above all, but it is a life of heaven for people who have loved God above all and their neighbor as themselves. The latter are the ones who have faith; the former do not. <p>The life of heaven is what is called "eternal life. " The life of hell is what is called "spiritual death. " </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 227</h4><p>227. Our life after death is one of love and the faith that comes from it. So whatever our love and faith were like when we lived in the world, that is the kind of life we will have forever. If we loved ourselves and material things more than anything else, our life is hell. If we loved God more than anything else, and other people as much as ourselves, our life is heaven. If our life is heaven, we have faith, but not if our life is hell.<p>A life of heaven is eternal life, but a life of hell is spiritual death. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 227</h4><p>227. A person's life after death is the life of his love and of his faith. So the nature of his love and faith when he lived in the world determines what kind of life awaits him for ever. Those who have loved themselves and the world above all have a life in hell. But a life in heaven awaits those who have loved God above all and the neighbour as themselves. These are those who have faith; the others do not. The life of heaven is what is called everlasting life, and the life of hell is what is called spiritual death. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 227</h4><p>227. A man's life after death is the life of his love and the life of his faith. Wherefore, such as had been a man's love, and such as had been his faith, during his life in the world, such a life awaits him to eternity. The life of hell awaits those who had loved themselves and the world above all things; and the life of heaven those who had loved God above all things, and the neighbour as themselves. The latter are they who have faith; but the former are those who have no faith. The life of heaven, is what is called eternal life; and the life of hell is what is called spiritual death. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 227</h4><p>227. The life of man after death is the life of his love and the life of his faith; hence such as his love and faith had been, when he lived in the world, such his life will remain to eternity. With those who loved themselves and the world above all things, it is the life of hell; and with those who had loved God above all things, and the neighbor as themselves, it is the life of heaven. The latter are they who have faith; but the former are they who have no faith. The life of heaven is called eternal life; and the life of hell is called spiritual death. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 227 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>227. Vita hominis post mortem est vita amoris et vita fidei ejus; inde qualis ei amor fuerat et qualis fides, cum vixit in mundo talis ei vita manet in aeternum: vita inferni est illis qui se et mundum super omnia amaverunt; et vita caeli illis qui Deum super omnia amaverunt, et proximum sicut se ipsum: hi sunt qui fidem habent, illi autem qui fidem non habent. Vita caeli est quae vocatur vita aeterna; et vita inferni est quae vocatur mors spiritualis. </p>
