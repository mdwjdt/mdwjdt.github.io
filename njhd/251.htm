<h4 align="center"></h4><p>251、由于死后人仍然活着，并且活到永远，而且人面临的死后生命将取决于他生前的爱与信，于是出于对全人类的爱，神降下启示以指导人的生命趋向，以利于人类能获得拯救。在基督教世界，神给我们的启示就是圣言。</p>

So since we live after death and our life after death is eternal, and since the particular life that lies ahead for us is based on the state of our love and faith, it follows that the Divine, out of love for the whole human race, has revealed the kinds of things that will guide us toward that life and be beneficial to our salvation. <p>In the Christian world, what the Divine has revealed for us is the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 251</h4><p>251. We do live on forever after death, and a life in harmony with our love and faith is in store for us there. So the Lord, because he loves the human race, revealed the things that would lead us into that life and would contribute to our spiritual well-being. The Bible is what the Lord has revealed. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 251</h4><p>251. Since therefore people live after death and go on living for ever, and their life then depends upon their love and faith, it follows that the Deity out of love for humanity has revealed the means which lead to such a life and are of value for salvation. God's revelation for us is the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 251</h4><p>251. Since a man, therefore, lives after death, and then lives to eternity; and since a life awaits him according to his love and faith; it follows that the Divine out of love towards the human race, has revealed such things as will lead to that life, and conduce to a man's salvation. What the Divine has revealed is the Word with us. </p>

What the Divine has revealed, is with us the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 251 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>251. Cum itaque homo post mortem vivit, et tunc in aeternum, et illum manet vita secundum ejus amorem et fidem, sequitur quod Divinum ex amore erga genus humanum revelaverit talia quae ducent ad illam vitam, et conducent saluti ejus. Quod Divinum revelavit est apud nos Verbum. </p>
