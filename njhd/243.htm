<h4 align="center"></h4><p>243、若要教会存在，就必须有来自圣言的教义，因为没有教义，就无法理解圣言。然而，对一个人来说，唯独教义并不构成教会，还要照教义生活。由此可推知，唯独信并不构成教会，还要有信之生活，也就是仁。真正的教义是仁与信一起的教义，而不是没有仁之教义的信之教义。因为信与仁一起的教义是生活的教义，但没有仁之教义的信之教义则不是。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>243、一个教会可以存在，那里就必须有来自圣言的教义，因为圣言没有教义是无法被理解的。然而，独有教义，它不构成人的教会，而是依据它的生活才构成教会。由此得出结论，仅有信，它不构成人的教会，而必须有信的生命，即仁爱才是。真正的教义是仁爱与信仰联合的教义，而非与仁爱分离的信仰教义。因为信仰与仁爱联合的教义是生活的教义，而非没有仁爱的信仰教义。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 243</h4><p>243. For a church to exist there also needs to be a body of teaching based on the Word, since without one the Word is not understood. Such teachings alone, however, do not constitute a church for us-that requires living in accordance with such teachings. It therefore follows that faith by itself does not constitute the church, but a church requires living according to faith, which means caring. <p>A genuine body of teaching is one focused on caring and faith together and not one focused on faith by itself. Clearly, a body of teaching focused on caring and faith together is about how to live, while a body of teaching focused on faith that does not include teachings focused on caring is not. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 243</h4><p>243. For the Christian religion to exist, there must be a religious philosophy that comes from the Bible, since without this, we cannot understand the Bible. But our religious philosophy by itself does not make us religious — only living by that philosophy does. This means that faith by itself does not make a religion, but living by our faith, which is kindness, does make a religion.<p>A real religious philosophy has both kindness and faith in it, and not faith without kindness. A philosophy of kindness and faith together is one that we live by. A philosophy of faith without kindness is one that we do not live by. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 243</h4><p>243. For a church to exist, there must be teaching from the Word, since the Word is not intelligible without teaching. But it is not teaching alone that makes the church in the case of a person, but living in accordance with that teaching. From this it follows that it is not faith alone which makes the church, but the life of faith, which is charity. The true teaching is the teaching of charity and faith together, not faith without charity. For the teaching of charity and faith together is teaching how to live one's life; but the teaching of faith without charity is not. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 243</h4><p>243. That the Church may exist, there must be doctrine from the Word; because without doctrine the Word cannot be understood. Yet it is not doctrine alone that constitutes the Church with a man, but a life according to doctrine. From this it follows that faith alone does not constitute the Church but the life of faith, which is charity. Genuine doctrine is the doctrine of charity and at the same time of faith, and not the doctrine of faith apart from the former; for the doctrine of charity and at the same time of faith, is the doctrine of life; but not the doctrine of faith apart from the doctrine of charity. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 243</h4><p>243. That there may be a church, there must be doctrine from the Word, since without doctrine the Word is not understood. Doctrine alone, however, does not constitute the church with man, but a life according to it. Hence it follows that faith alone does not constitute the church with man, but the life of faith, which is charity. Genuine doctrine is the doctrine of charity and faith together, and not the doctrine of faith separate from charity; for the doctrine of charity and faith together is the doctrine of life; but not the doctrine of faith without the doctrine of charity. </p> 
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 243 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>243. Ut ecclesia sit, erit doctrina ex Verbo, quoniam absque doctrina non intelligitur Verbum; ast sola doctrina non facit ecclesiam apud hominem, sed vita secundum illam. Inde sequitur quod non fides sola faciat ecclesiam, sed vita fidei quae est charitas. Genuina doctrina est doctrina charitatis et simul fidei, et non doctrina fidei absque illa: nam doctrina charitatis et simul fidei, est doctrina vitae; non autem doctrina fidei absque doctrina charitatis. </p>
