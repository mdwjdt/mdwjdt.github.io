<h4 align="center"></h4><p>131、对一个教会成员来说，良心是通过来自圣言，或来自源于圣言的教义的信之真理形成的，这取决于他如何从心里接受这些真理。因为当一个人知道信之真理，以自己的方式领悟它们，后来又意愿并实行它们时，他就获得了良心。从心里接受是指在意愿中接受，因为那被称为心的，是一个人的意愿。这就是为何那些拥有良心的人说他们从心里所说的话，做他们从心里所做的事。他们也没有一个分裂的心智，因为他们照着他们所理解，并以之为真理和良善的东西行事。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>131、对于基督教会的人来说，他的良心或者被来自圣言的信仰真理所塑造，或者成形于基于圣言的教义，这取决于他内心对其接受的程度。因为，当人认识了信仰的真理并以他自己的方式领悟它们，然后意愿于它们并付诸行动时，他就获得了良心。从心里接受的意思是从意志上接受，因为人的意志被称之为心。因此有良心的人说的话是从内心说的，做的事情是从内心做的。他的心志单一绝无分裂，因为他做任何事情都是依据自己对良善和真理的理解并信心。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 131</h4><p>131. For people in the [Christian] church, their conscience is shaped either by truths [they themselves have drawn] from the Word that have become part of their faith or else by things based on the Word that they have been taught by others, depending on the extent to which they have taken these to heart. As we come to know and believe truths and comprehend them in our own way, when we will them and do them, then our conscience comes into being. Taking them to heart is taking them into our will, because our will is what we refer to as our heart. <p>That is why people who have a conscience say from the heart whatever they say, and do from the heart whatever they do. They also have a mind that is not divided, because what they do is consistent with what they understand and believe to be true and good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 131</h4><p>131. If we are religious, our conscience is formed by the truth in the faith we get from the Bible, or from principles that come from the Bible, depending on our acceptance of them in our heart. When we know what is true from our faith, understand it in our own way, and then want it to happen and act on it, we build up a conscience. “Acceptance in our heart” means acceptance in our motivation, since our motivation is what we call our “heart.” This is why, when we have conscience, the things we say and do come from our heart. We do not have a divided mind; we do whatever we understand and believe to be true and good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 131</h4><p>131. A member of the church has his conscience formed by the truths of faith he learns from the Word, or by teaching from the Word, depending upon how he receives them in his heart. For when someone knows the truths of faith and grasps them in his own manner, and so comes to will and do them, then he develops a conscience. Receiving them in the heart means in the will, for a person's will is what is called the heart. That is why those who possess a conscience speak from the heart what they say, and do from the heart what they do. They also have their mind undivided, for they act in accordance with what they understand and believe to be true and good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 131</h4><p>131. Conscience is formed with a man of the Church through the truths of faith from the Word, or from the doctrine derived from the Word, according to their reception in the heart. For when a man is acquainted with the truths of faith, and apprehends them in his own way, and afterwards wills and does them, he receives conscience. Reception in the heart means reception in the will; for a man's will is what is called the heart. Hence, those who have conscience, say what they say from the heart, and do what they do from the heart. They also have an undivided mind, for they act according to what they understand and believe to be true and good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 131</h4><p>131. Conscience, with the man of the church, is formed by the truths of faith from the Word, or from doctrine out of the Word, according to their reception in the heart; for when man knows the truths of faith, and comprehends them in his own manner, and then wills them and does them, he then acquires conscience. Reception in the heart is reception in the will, for the will of man is what is called the heart. Hence it is that they who have conscience, speak from the heart the things which they speak, and do from the heart the things which they do. They have also an undivided mind, for they act according to that which they understand and believe to be true and good. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 131 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>131. Conscientia apud hominem ecclesiae formatur per vera fidei ex Verbo, aut ex doctrina e Verbo, secundum receptionem illorum in corde; nam cum homo scit vera fidei, et capit illa suo modo, ac dein vult illa, et facit illa, tunc fit ei conscientia: receptio in corde est in voluntate, nam voluntas hominis est quae vocatur cor. Inde est, quod illi qui conscientiam habent, ex corde loquantur quae loquuntur, et ex corde faciant quae faciunt: habent etiam illi mentem non divisam; nam secundum id quod intelligunt et credunt verum et bonum esse, faciunt. </p>
