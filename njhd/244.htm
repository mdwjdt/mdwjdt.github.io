<h4 align="center"></h4><p>244、那些在教会之外，承认一位神，并照自己的宗教信仰活在某种对邻之仁中的人，与属教会的人有某种共同之处；因为凡信神并过着良善生活的人都不会受到诅咒。由此明显可知，主的教会无处不在，遍及全世界；尽管它在承认主并有圣言存在的地方取了一种特定形式。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>244、教会之外之人若承认一个上帝，根据他们的宗教原则去生活，并且采取某种方式去关爱友邻，这些人与教会之内的人具有共同之处。因为信仰上帝且生活有道德的人是不会被谴责的。 显而易见，尽管教会是指一些特别机构，那里承认主且有圣言，实际上主的教会无处不在。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 244</h4><p>244. People outside the church who acknowledge one God and in accordance with their religion devote their lives in some way to caring about their neighbor have something in common with people in the church, because no one who believes in God and lives a good life is damned. This shows that although the Lord's church takes a particular form where the Lord is acknowledged and the Word is found, it actually exists everywhere in the whole world. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 244</h4><p>244. People who are not Christian, but accept one God and live by some type of kindness toward other people according to their religion, share a common bond with Christians. No one who believes in God and lives a good life is condemned. So you can see that the Lord’s religion is everywhere in the whole world, even if it is particularly where people accept the Lord and have the Bible. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 244</h4><p>244. Those outside the church who acknowledge one God and who in accordance with their religion live in some sort of charity towards the neighbour are in communion with those who belong to the church. For no one is damned who believes in God and lives a good life. From this it is plain that the Lord's church exists throughout the whole world, although it is especially located where the Lord is acknowledged and the Word is known. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 244</h4><p>244. Those who are outside the Church, and acknowledge one God, and live according to their religion in some charity towards the neighbour, are in communion with those who are of the Church; for no one who believes in God and leads a good life, is damned. From this it is evident, that the Lord's Church is everywhere throughout the world; although specifically it is, where the Lord is acknowledged, and where the Word exists. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 244</h4><p>244. They who are out of the church and acknowledge one God, and live according to their religious principle, and in some charity towards the neighbor, are in communion with those who are of the church; for no man who believes in God and lives well, is condemned. Hence it is evident, that the church of the Lord is in the whole world, although specifically, where the Lord is acknowledged, and where the Word is. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 244 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>244. Illi qui extra ecclesiam sunt, et agnoscunt unum Deum, et secundum religiosum suum in quadam charitate erga proximum vivunt, in communione sunt cum illis qui ab ecclesia; quoniam nemo qui credit in Deum et bene vivit, damnatur: inde patet quod ecclesia Domini sit ubivis in universo terrarum orbe, tametsi in specie ubi Dominus agnoscitur, et ubi Verbum est. </p>
