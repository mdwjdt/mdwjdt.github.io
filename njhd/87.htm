<h4 align="center"></h4><p>87、由于良善因人而异，所以可推知，良善的性质决定了每个人在哪个层级上、以哪种方式而为邻舍。情况就是这样，这一点从主关于落在强盗手中的那个人的比喻明显看出来；他被打了个半死，祭司和利未人都经过了；只有撒玛利亚人在他的伤口倒上油和酒，并包扎好，然后扶他骑上自己的牲口，带到店里去照应他，并且为照应他作了安排。这个撒玛利亚人因实行了仁爱，故被称为邻舍（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.29.htm">10:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.37.htm">37</a>）。由此可知，那些处于良善的人才是邻舍；事实上，撒玛利亚人倒在伤口上的“油和酒”表示良善和真理。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>87、因为每个人的良善都是不同的，由此可得，每个人的良善特性，决定了他在何种程度和方式上是友邻。在主的寓言中，一个人遭遇了强盗，伤重危殆，祭司从旁路过扬长而去，利未人也是如此；但是撒玛利亚人为他的伤口倒上油和酒，并包扎好，扶他骑上自己的牲口，带到店里去照应他。请店主照料伤者：由于他践行仁慈的良善，所以被称为友邻（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.29.htm">10:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.37.htm">37</a>）。因此可知，所谓的友邻是活出良善的人。撒玛利亚人倒在伤口上的 “油和酒”，还代表展现出的良善和真理。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 87</h4><p>87. Since the sort of goodness in every individual is different, it follows that the nature of each person's goodness determines both the level at which and the way in which that individual is "a neighbor. " We can see that this is the case from the Lord's parable about a man who fell among thieves, whom both a priest and a Levite passed by, leaving him half dead, while a Samaritan, after he had bound up his wounds and poured in oil and wine, lifted him onto his own beast and brought him to an inn and made arrangements for his care. The Samaritan is called "a neighbor" because his actions were those of a caring person (<a href="3927/luke_10_29.htm">Luke 10:29-37</a>). We can tell from this that the people who are "a neighbor" are the ones whose lives are devoted to doing good. In fact, the oil and the wine that the Samaritan poured into the wounds mean goodness and the truth that it shows us. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 87</h4><p>87. Since we all have different good qualities, it follows that people’s good qualities determine the level of their relationship to us as friends. The Lord makes this clear in his parable about the man who fell into the hands of robbers and was left half dead. A priest walked right by him, and so did a Levite. But a Samaritan bandaged his wounds and poured oil and wine on them. Then he put the man on his own animal, took him to an inn, and arranged for him to be cared for. The Samaritan was a friend to the man because he acted from the good of kindness (<a href="3927/luke_10_29.htm">Luke 10:29-37</a>).<p>From this example we can understand that people are our friends when they are doing good things. The oil and wine that the Samaritan poured on the wounds symbolize good qualities and the true ideas that go with them. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 87</h4><p>87. Since the good in each individual is different, it follows that the quality of that good determines on what level and how anyone is the neighbour. This fact is obvious from the Lord's parable about the man who fell into the hands of robbers, and a priest, as well as a Levite, went past him as he lay half-dead. But the Samaritan, after binding up his wounds and pouring oil and wine into them, lifted him on to his own animal and took him to an inn, and gave orders that he should be looked after. This man is called the neighbour, because he exercised the good of charity (<a href="3927/luke_10_29.htm">Luke 10:29-37</a>). This shows that the neighbour means those in a state of good. The oil and wine, which the Samaritan poured into his wounds, also stand for good and the truth from it. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 87</h4><p>87. Since good with every one is various, it follows, that the quality of good determines the degree, and the proportion in which any one is a neighbour. That this is so is plain from the Lord's parable concerning the man who fell among thieves, who, being half dead, was passed by both by a priest and also by a Levite; but whom a Samaritan, after he had bound up his wounds, and poured oil and wine into them, put upon his own beast and brought to an inn, and concerning whom he gave orders that care should be taken. This man, because he practised the good of charity, is called a neighbour (<a href="3927/luke_10_29.htm">Luke 10:29-37</a>). From this it may be known that he is a neighbour who is in good; the oil and wine also which the Samaritan poured into the wounds, signify good and its truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 87</h4><p>87. Because good varies with everyone, it therefore follows, that the quality of good determines in what degree and in what proportion anyone is the neighbor. That this is the case is plain from the Lord's parable concerning him that fell among robbers, whom, when half dead, the priest passed by, and also the Levite; but the Samaritan, after he had bound up his wounds, and poured in oil and wine, took him up on his own beast, and led him to an inn, and ordered that care should be taken of him: because he exercised the good of charity, he is called the neighbor (<a href="3927/luke_10_29.htm">Luke 10:29-37</a>). Hence it may be known that they are the neighbor who are in good: "the oil and wine," which the Samaritan poured into the wounds, also signify good and its truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 87 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>87. Quia bonum apud unumquemvis est varium, inde sequitur quod quale boni determinet in quo gradu et in qua ratione aliquis est proximus. Quod ita sit, patet a Domini parabola de illo qui incidit in latrones, quem semimortuum sacerdos praeterivit, et quoque Levita; sed Samarita, postquam obligavit vulnera ejus, et infudit oleum et vinum, sustulit super proprium jumentum, et duxit in diversorium, et ordinavit ut cura ejus haberetur: hic quia bonum charitatis exercuit, proximus dicitur (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_87/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_10_29-37" target=_top>Lucas 10:29-37</a>). Inde sciri potest quod proximus sint qui in bono: "oleum et vinum," quae Samarita vulneribus infudit, etiam significant bonum et ejus verum. </p>
