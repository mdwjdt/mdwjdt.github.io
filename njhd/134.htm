<h4 align="center"></h4><p>134、人能拥有一个良善的良心和一个公义的良心。良善的良心是内在人的良心，公义的良心是外在人的良心。良善的良心在于出于内在情感照信之诫命行事，而公义的良心在于出于外在情感照文明道德的法律行事。那些拥有良善的良心之人也拥有公义的良心；但那些只有公义的良心之人拥有获得良善良心的能力；并且一旦接受教导，他们就会获得它。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>134、人有一个关爱良善的良心，还有一个关爱正义的良心。关爱良善的良心是内在之人的良心，关爱正义的良心是外在之人的良心。关爱良善的良心敦促他根据信仰的教导去行动，而关爱正义的良心则督促他外在地遵守公民和道德法律。具有关爱良善的良心之人，也有关爱正义的良心。而只有关爱正义的良心之人，有能力接受关爱良善的良心，如果他们得到教导，就确实能接受它。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 134</h4><p>134. People can have a conscience that is focused on what is good, and they can have a conscience that is focused on what is right. A conscience that is focused on what is good is a conscience that resides in our inner self; a conscience that is focused on what is right is a conscience that resides in our outer self. If we are driven from within to live by the precepts of faith, we have a conscience that is focused on what is good; if we are driven by outward considerations to live by civil and moral laws, we have a conscience that is focused on what is right. <p>People who have a conscience that is focused on what is good also have a conscience that is focused on what is right. People who have only a conscience that is focused on what is right nevertheless have the capacity to develop a conscience that is focused on what is good, and they do so when they are taught about it. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 134</h4><p>134. We have a conscience about what is good, and a conscience about what is fair. Our conscience about what is good is our inner self’s conscience, and our conscience about what is fair is our outer self’s conscience.<p>Conscience about what is good is doing things according to the rules of faith from an inner love. Conscience about what is fair is doing things according to civil and ethical law from an outer love. When we have a conscience about what is good, we also have a conscience about what is fair. But when we only have a conscience about what is fair, we are able to accept a conscience about what is good — and we do accept it when we are taught about it. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 134</h4><p>134. A person can have a conscience of good and a conscience of justice. A conscience of good is that of the internal man, that of justice is that of the external man. A conscience of good is acting according to the commands of faith out of internal affection, but a conscience of justice is acting according to civil and moral laws out of external affection. Those who have a conscience of good also have a conscience of justice. But those who have only a conscience of justice have the capability of receiving a conscience of good, and they do so when they are taught. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 134</h4><p>134. Man has a conscience of what is good, and a conscience of what is just. The conscience of what is good is the conscience of the internal man, and the conscience of what is just, the conscience of the external man. The conscience of what is good consists in acting according to the commandments of faith from an internal affection; but the conscience of what is just, in acting according to civil and moral laws from an external affection. Those who have the conscience of what is good, have also the conscience of what is just; but those who have only the conscience of what is just, possess the ability to receive the conscience of what is good; and they, also, do receive it upon being instructed. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 134</h4><p>134. Man has a conscience of what is good, and a conscience of what is just. The conscience of what is good is the conscience of the internal man, and the conscience of what is just is the conscience of the external man. The conscience of what is good consists in acting according to the precepts of faith from internal affection; but the conscience of what is just consists in acting according to civil and moral laws from external affection. They who have the conscience of what is good, have also the conscience of what is just; but they who have only the conscience of what is just, are in a faculty of receiving the conscience of what is good; and they also do receive it when they are instructed. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 134 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>134. Est homini conscientia boni et conscientia justi. Conscientia boni est conscientia interni hominis, et conscientia justi est conscientia externi hominis. Conscientia boni est facere secundum praecepta fidei ex affectione interna, at conscientia justi est facere secundum leges civiles et morales ex affectione externa. Qui conscientiam boni habent, illi quoque conscientiam justi habent; at qui modo conscientiam justi habent, illi in facultate sunt recipiendi conscientiam boni; et quoque recipiunt cum instructi. </p>
