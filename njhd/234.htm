<h4 align="center"></h4><p>234、与人同在的天堂住在他的内在里面，因而住在他出于爱和信的意愿和思维里面，并由此住在他的外在里面；这外在就是他出于爱和信的言行。但天堂不在脱离内在的外在里面，因为所有伪善之人都能做善事，说好话，却没有好的意愿和思维。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>234、人里面的天堂存在于人的内在，即存在于人来自爱和信的意志和思想中，并且由此而彰显于他的外在，也就是从爱和信发出的言谈举止。但是如果外在与内在割裂，天堂就不在人的外在。因为所有的伪善者都能做得好、说得好，但他们没有好的意愿和思想。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 234</h4><p>234. The heaven that is within us is in our inner self. It is present in our willing and thinking from love and faith. As a result it is also present in our outer self, in which we act and speak from love and faith. Heaven is not, however, present in our outer self apart from our inner self; after all, every hypocrite can do and say good things without willing and thinking good things. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 234</h4><p>234. Heaven is in our inner self — in the motives and thoughts we get from love and faith. From there it goes into our outer self, which does and says things from love and faith. But if it is not in our inner self, it is not in our outer self, either. Hypocrites can say and do good things, but they do not have good motives and thoughts. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 234</h4><p>234. A person has heaven in his internal, so in his willing and thinking as a result of love and faith, and from this in his external, which is his acting and speaking as the result of love and faith. But it is not to be found in the external without being in the internal. For all hypocrites can do good deeds and speak good words, but they do not have good intentions or thoughts. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 234</h4><p>234. Heaven resides with a man in his Internal, and thus in volition and thought, from love and faith, and thence it is in his External which consists in acting and speaking from love and faith. But heaven is not in the External apart from the Internal; for all hypocrites are able to act and speak well, but they cannot will and think well. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 234</h4><p>234. Heaven is with man in his internal, thus in his willing and thinking from love and faith, and thence in his external, which is in acting and speaking from love and faith. But heaven is not in man's external without the internal; for all hypocrites can act and speak well, but they cannot will and think well. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 234 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>234. Caelum apud hominem est in interno ejus, ita in velle et cogitare ex amore et fide, et inde in externo, quod est ex amore et fide facere et loqui: non autem est in externo absque interno; nam facere bene et loqui bene possunt omnes hypocritae, at non velle bene et cogitare bene. </p>
