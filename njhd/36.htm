<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第三章　内在之人与外在之人</h4><p>36、人被如此造成以至于能同时存在于灵性世界和物质世界中。灵性世界是天使的居住之地，物质世界是人类的居住之地。由于人是如此被造，因此他被赋予了内在和外在。通过内在，人住在灵性世界；通过外在，人住在物质世界。他的内在被称为内在之人，他的外在被称为外在之人。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 36</h4><p>36. The Inner Self and the Outer Self<p>We are created in such a way that we are in the spiritual world and the earthly world at one and the same time. The spiritual world is where angels are and the earthly world is where we are. And since that is how we are created, we are given an inner nature and an outer nature-an inner nature that allows us to be in the spiritual world, and an outer nature that allows us to be in the earthly world. Our inner nature is what we refer to as the inner self, and our outer nature is what we refer to as the outer self. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 36</h4><p>36. Chapter 3. Our Inner and Outer Selves<p>As human beings, we were created to be in both the spiritual world and the material world at the same time. The spiritual world is where angels live, and the material world is where people live.<p>Since we were created in this way, we have both an inner part and an outer part. We have an inner part because we exist in the spiritual world, and an outer part because we exist in the material world. Our inner part is called our “inner self,” and our outer part is called our “outer self.” </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 36</h4><p>36. III. ON THE INTERNAL MAN AND THE EXTERNAL MAN <p>Human beings have been so created as to be at once both in the spiritual world and the natural world. The spiritual world is where angels live, the natural world is where human beings live. Because human beings are created so as to be in both worlds, they have been given an internal and an external, the internal to enable them to be in the spiritual world, and an external to enable them to be in the natural world. A person's internal is what is called the internal man, the external what is called the external man. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 36</h4><p>36. THE INTERNAL AND THE EXTERNAL MAN. <p>Man was so created as to be at the same time in the spiritual and in the natural world. The spiritual world is where the angels are, and the natural world where men are; and because man was so created there was given to him an Internal and an External - an Internal, through which he may be in the spiritual world, and an External, through which he may be in the natural world. His Internal is what is called the internal man, and his External what is called the external man. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 36</h4><p>36. III. THE INTERNAL AND THE EXTERNAL MAN.<p>Man is so created as to be in the spiritual world and in the natural world at the same time. The spiritual world is where the angels are, and the natural world where men are. As man is so created, there has been given to him an internal and an external; an internal by which he is in the spiritual world, and an external by which he is in the natural world. His internal is what is called the internal man, and his external is what is called the external man. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 36 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>36. (III.) DE INTERNO ET EXTERNO HOMINE.<p>HOMO ita creatus est ut simul sit in mundo spirituali et in mundo naturali. Mundus spiritualis est ubi sunt angeli, et mundus naturalis ubi sunt homines. Et quia homo ita creatus est, ideo datum est ei internum et externum; internum per quod sit in mundo spirituali, externum per quod sit in mundo naturali. Internum ejus est quod vocatur internus homo, et externum quod vocatur externus homo. </p>
