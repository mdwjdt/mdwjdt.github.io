<h4 align="center"></h4><p>322、王权在于照着国家法律进行管理，以及照着这些法律公正地审判。一个国王若视法律在自己之上，就是明智的；一个国王若视法律在自己之下，则是不明智的。一个视法律在自己之上的国王将王权归于法律，法律是他的主人。因为他知道法律意味着正义，一切系真正义的正义都是神性。然而，一个视自己在法律之上的国王则将王权归于自己，要么相信自己就是法律，要么相信正义的法律来自他自己。因此，他篡夺了神性之物；而事实上，他应当在它之下，也就是服从于它。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>322、王权包括按照王国治内的法律进行治理，以及凭借正义依照法律执行审判。置法律于自己之上的国王是明智的，把自己置于法律之上的国王是不明智的。 置法律于自己之上的国王使王权服从法律，并且他也受制于法律，因为他知道法律是正义，一切真正的正义就是神。 但是把自己置于法律之上者使王权服从自己，他或者以法律自居，或者认为正义的法律出自他自己。因此他把属于神的攫为己有，虽然他本应受制于它。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 322</h4><p>322. Royal governance consists in conducting administration according to the laws of the realm and in delivering judgments in accord with those laws with an eye toward justice. Monarchs who regard the laws as higher than themselves are wise; monarchs who regard themselves as above the law are not. Monarchs who regard the laws as higher than themselves ascribe the royal governing to the law, and allow the law to rule over themselves. They know that the law is justice and all justice that is truly just is divine. Monarchs who see themselves as above the law, though, ascribe the royal governing to themselves. They believe either that they themselves are the law or that the law that is justice comes from them. So they claim for themselves something that is divine, when they should be subject to it. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 322</h4><p>322. Authority comes from running the country according to its laws, and giving judgments from a sense of justice. Rulers who consider the law to be above themselves are wise. But those who think they are above the law are not wise. Rulers who consider the law to be above themselves place government in law, and the law rules them. They know that the law is justice, and that all true justice is divine. But rulers who consider themselves above the law think they themselves are the government. They either think that they are the law, or that the law, which is justice, comes from themselves. In this way, they claim for themselves something that is divine, to which they should be subject themselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 322</h4><p>322. Royalty consists in governing in accordance with the kingdom's laws, and in judging justly in accordance with them. A king who looks upon the laws as above him is wise; one who looks upon himself as above the laws is not. A king who looks upon the laws as above him attributes royalty to the law, and the law is his master. For he knows that law is justice, and all justice which is truly justice is Divine. One, however, who regards himself as above the laws, attributes royalty to himself and either believes himself to be the law or the law which is justice to be from himself. Thus he claims for himself what is God's, when he ought to be subject to it. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 322</h4><p>322. The regal office consists in administering according to the laws of the realm, and in judging according to these laws, from a principle of justice. A king who regards the laws as above himself, is wise; but he who considers himself as being above the law, is not wise. A king who looks upon the laws as above himself, places the regal office in the law, and the law rules over him; for he knows that the law means justice, and all justice, which is justice, is Divine. But he who looks upon himself as being above the laws, places the regal office in himself, and either believes himself to be the law, or that the law which is justice, is derived from himself; hence he arrogates to himself that which is Divine; when yet he ought to be under it. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 322</h4><p>322. Royalty consists in administering according to the laws of the realm and in judging according to them from justice. The king who regards the laws as above himself is wise, but he who regards himself as above the laws is not wise. The king who regards the laws as above himself places the royalty in the law, and the law has dominion over him, for he knows that the law is justice, and that all justice which is justice is Divine. But he who regards himself as above the laws places the royalty in himself, and either believes himself to be the law, or the law, which is justice, to be from himself; hence he arrogates to himself that which is Divine, under which nevertheless he ought to be. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 322 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>322. Regium consistit in administrando secundum leges regni, et in judicando secundum illas ex justo. Rex qui spectat leges supra se, is sapit; qui autem spectat se supra leges, is non sapit. Rex qui spectat leges supra se, is regium ponit in lege, et lex dominator super illum; scit enim quod lex sit justitia, et omnis justitia quae justitia est Divina: qui autem spectat se supra leges, is regium ponit in se, et credit se vel esse legem, vel legem quae justitia esse a se; inde quod Divinum est, sibi arrogat, sub quo tamen erit. </p>
