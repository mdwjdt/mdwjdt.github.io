<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 211</h4><p>211. However, people who do not know anything about the inner or spiritual meaning of the Word do not grasp how the Holy Supper accomplishes this joining together, because their thoughts do not go beyond the Word's outward meaning, which is its literal meaning. It is from the Word's inner or spiritual meaning that we know what is meant by the body and the blood, the bread and the wine, and eating. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 211</h4><p>211. But we cannot know how this union takes place through the holy supper unless we know something about the Bible’s inner, spiritual meaning. Otherwise, our thinking will not get beyond the outer, literal meaning. From the Bible’s inner, spiritual meaning, we can understand the meaning of body and blood, of bread and wine, and of eating them. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 211</h4><p>211. How that linking takes place cannot be grasped by those who do not know something about the internal or spiritual sense of the Word. For the thinking of these people does not extend beyond the external or literal sense. From the internal or spiritual sense of the Word it may be known what is the meaning of body and blood, of bread and wine, and also of eating. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 211</h4><p>211. But how conjunction is effected through the Holy Supper, is not comprehended by those who do not know anything of the internal or spiritual sense of the Word, because they do not think beyond the external sense, which is that of the letter. From the internal or spiritual sense of the Word, the signification of the body and blood, and of the bread and wine, and also of eating, is known. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 211</h4><p>211. But how conjunction is effected by it is not understood by those who do not know the internal or spiritual sense of the Word, since they do not think beyond the external sense, which is the sense of the letter. It is known from the internal or spiritual sense of the Word, what is signified by the "body" and "blood," and by the "bread" and "wine"; and also what is signified by "eating." </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 211 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>211. Sed quomodo per illam fit conjunctio, non capiunt qui non sciunt aliquid de sensu interno seu spirituali Verbi, nam illi, non ultra sensum externum, qui est sensus litterae, cogitant. Ex sensu interno seu spirituali Verbi scitur quid significat "corpus" et "sanguis," et quid "panis" et "vinum," tum quid "manducatio." </p>
