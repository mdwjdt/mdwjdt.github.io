<h4 align="center"></h4><p>208、因此，可知主在《马可福音》中的话的意思：</p><p>信而受洗的必然得救，不信的必被定罪。（<a href="http://39-27.cn/可16.16.htm">16:16</a>）</p><p>“信的人”就是承认主并通过圣言接受从祂而来的神性真理的人；“受洗的人”是指通过那些真理被主重生的人。</p><p>摘自《属天的奥秘》：</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 208</h4><p>208. We can therefore conclude what is meant by the Lord's words in Mark: "Those who believe and are baptized will be saved; but those who do not believe will be condemned" (<a href="3927/mark_16_16.htm">Mark 16:16</a>). The one who believes is the one who acknowledges the Lord and accepts divine truths from him through the Word; and the one who is baptized is the one whom the Lord regenerates by these means. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 208</h4><p>208. So you can see what the Lord means when he says in Mark: “Anyone who believes and is baptized will be set free. Anyone who does not believe will be considered guilty” (<a href="3927/mark_16_16.htm">Mark 16:16</a>). We believe when we come to know the Lord and accept divine truths from him through the Bible. We are baptized when we are reborn from the Lord by means of these true things. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 208</h4><p>208. This can establish what is meant by the Lord's words in Mark: <p>He who has believed and has been baptised will be saved; but he who has not believed will be condemned. <a href="3927/mark_16_16.htm">Mark 16:16</a>. <p>One who has believed is one who acknowledges the Lord and receives Divine truths from Him by means of the Word. One who has been baptised is one who is being regenerated by the Lord by means of those truths. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 208</h4><p>208. From this may appear what is meant by the Lord's words in <a href="3927/mark_16_16.htm">Mark 16:16</a>, "He that believeth and has been baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be condemned;" he that believes signifies him who acknowledges the Lord, and receives from Him Divine Truths through the Word: and he who has been baptized, signifies him who through these truths is being regenerated by the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 208</h4><p>208. Hence may be seen what is meant by the Lord's words in Mark:<p>He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be condemned (<a href="3927/mark_16_16.htm">16:16</a>).<p>"He who believeth" is he who acknowledges the Lord, and receives Divine truths from Him through the Word; "he who is baptized" is he who is regenerated by the Lord by means of those truths. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 208 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>208. Inde constare potest quid intelligitur per Domini verba apud Marcum,<p>"Qui crediderit et baptizatus fuerit, salvabitur; qui vero non crediderit, condemnabitur" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_208/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_16_16" target=_top>Marcus 16:16</a>);<p>"qui crediderit," est qui agnoscit Dominum, ac recipit Divina vera ab Ipso per Verbum; "qui baptizatus fuerit," est qui per illa a Domino regeneratur. </p>
