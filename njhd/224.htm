<h4 align="center"></h4><p>224、这内在是每个人与生俱来的；他的外在是其内在用来执行其信与爱之意图的工具。那被称为灵的，就是内在；被称为身体的，是外在。被称为身体的外在适合在自然界发挥功用，当人死亡时，这外在就被丢弃了；而被称为灵的内在适合在灵界发挥功用，这内在不会死。那时，如果人在世时是良善的，这内在就是一个善灵和一位天使；但如果人在世时是邪恶的，它就是一个恶灵。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>224、每个出生的人都有内在部分，而人的外在部分是人的内在用来执行他所信所爱的工具。人的内在部分称为灵，外在部分称为身体。被称为身体的外在的部分适用于物质世界，在人死后就被废弃了；而人的内在部分，称之为灵的，适用于灵界，不会死。如果人在这个世界是良善的，其内在部分在灵界将会是善灵，是天使，但若人在世时是邪恶的，在灵界将会是恶灵。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 224</h4><p>224. Everyone who is born has this "inner being. " Our outer being is our inner being's means of carrying out the intentions of its faith and love. <p>The inner being is what we call "the spirit," and the outer being is what we call "the body. " The outer being, called the body, is adapted to functioning in an earthly world. It is cast off when we die. But the inner being, called the spirit, is adapted to functioning in a spiritual world. It does not die. If we have been a good person in this world, our inner being is then a good spirit and an angel; if we have been an evil person in this world, our inner being is then an evil spirit. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 224</h4><p>224. Every person who is born has this inner self. Our outer self enables us to put what we believe and love into action. Our inner self is our spirit, and our outer self is our body.<p>Our outer self, or body, is made for productive action in the material world. We put it aside when we die. Our inner self, or spirit, is made for productive action in the spiritual world. It does not die. This inner self becomes a good spirit or angel, if we have been a good person in the world, but it becomes a harmful spirit if we have been harmful in the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 224</h4><p>224. Every person who is born has this internal. His external is the means by which he performs what faith and love dictate. The internal is what is called the spirit, the external is what is called the body. The external, called the body, is fitted for services in the natural world; this is cast away when a person dies. But the internal, called the spirit, is fitted for services in the spiritual world; and this does not die. This internal is then a good spirit and an angel, if the person was good in the world; but an evil spirit, if he was evil in the world. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 224</h4><p>224. This Internal is with every man that is born: his External is that by which he does the things which belong to faith and love. The Internal is what is called the spirit, and the External what is called the body. The External which is called the body, is adapted to uses in the natural world; this is cast off when a man dies: but the Internal which is called the spirit, is adapted to uses in the spiritual world; this does not die. This Internal is then a good spirit and an angel, if the man had been good while in the world; but it is an evil spirit, if the man while in the world, had been evil. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 224</h4><p>224. This internal is with every man who is born; his external is that by which he brings into effect the things which are of his faith and love. The internal is called the spirit, and the external is called the body. The external, which is called the body, is accommodated to the uses in the natural world, this is rejected when man dies; but the internal, which is called the spirit, is accommodated to the uses in the spiritual world, this does not die. This internal is then a good spirit and an angel, if the man had been good in the world; but an evil spirit if man had been evil in the world. </p> 
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 224 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>224. Hoc internum est apud omnem hominem qui nascitur; externum ejus est per quod efficit illa quae fidei et amoris sunt. Internum est quod vocatur spiritus, et externum quod vocatur corpus. Externum, quod vocatur corpus, accommodatum est usibus in mundo naturali; hoc rejicitur cum homo moritur: at internum, quod vocatur spiritus, accommodatum est usibus in mundo spirituali; hoc non moritur: hoc internum tunc est spiritus bonus et angelus, si homo in mundo bonus fuerat; at spiritus malus, si homo in mundo malus fuerat. </p>
