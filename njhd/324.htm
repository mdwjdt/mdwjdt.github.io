<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 324</h4><p>324. There are monarchs with absolute power, who regard their subjects as slaves, so much so that they as monarchs have a right to their subjects' possessions and even lives. If they exercise this right, they are not monarchs but tyrants. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 324</h4><p>324. Rulers who have absolute power and think their citizens are such slaves that the ruler has a right to their lives and property — and who actually use this power — are not rulers but tyrants. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 324</h4><p>324. A king with absolute power, who believes that his subjects are so far his slaves that he has right over their possessions and lives, is, if he exercises that power, no king but a tyrant. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 324</h4><p>324. A king who has absolute power, and who believes that his subjects are such slaves that he has a right to their possessions and lives, if he exercises such a right, is not a king but a tyrant. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 324</h4><p>324. A king who has absolute power, who believes that his subjects are such slaves that he has a right to their possessions and lives, and if he exercises it, is not a king, but a tyrant. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 324 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>324. Rex cui absoluta potestas, qui credit quod subditi ejus tales servi sint ut jus habeat in eorum possessiones et vitas, et si id exercet, non rex est sed tyrannus. </p>
