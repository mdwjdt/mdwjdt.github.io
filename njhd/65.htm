<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">五、爱自己和爱世界</h4 ><p>65、爱自己在于只希望自己好，不希望别人好，除非是为了自己，甚至不希望教会、国家、任何人类社会或自己的同胞好；还在于只为自己的名声、荣耀或赞美而向他们行善。因为它若非在向他人所行的良善中看到这些，心里会说，这有什么用？我为什么这样做？这对我有什么好处？从而忽略他们。由此明显可知，凡爱自己的人都不爱教会，也不爱自己的祖国、社会和同胞，以及任何良善，只爱他自己。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">第五章　爱自己和爱世界</h4><p>65、爱自己在于只希望自己好。除非是为了自己，否则不希望别人好，甚至不希望教会、国家、任何人类社会以及自己的同胞好。此外，他对教会，国家或任何人行善也只是为了自己的名声、利益和赞誉。因而除非看到行善的酬偿，他会在心里说：“做这有什么用处？我为什么要做这事？它会给我带来啥好处？”。随之他会弃之不理。显然爱自己的人不爱教会，国家、社会和同胞，也不爱任何善行，而仅仅爱他自己。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 65</h4><p>65. Love for Ourselves and Love for the World<p>Love for ourselves is intending benefit only to ourselves and not to others unless it is in our own interests-having no goodwill toward the church or our country or toward any group of people or any fellow citizen. It is also being good to the church, our country, and other people only for the sake of our own reputation, advancement, or praise, so that unless we see some such reward in the good we may do for them we say at heart, "What's the use? Why should I? What's in it for me?" and forget about it. This shows that when we live a life of self-love we are not loving the church, our country, our community, our fellow citizens, or anything worthwhile-only ourselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 65</h4><p>65. Chapter 5. Selfishness and Materialism<p>“Selfishness” is wishing well only to ourselves, and not to anyone else except for our own benefit. When we are selfish, we do not love our religion, our country, any human community, or our fellow citizens. We do good things for them only to increase our own reputation, status, and fame. If we do not see any advantage to ourselves in something we might do for other people, we say in our hearts, “What’s the difference? Why should I do it? What’s in it for me?” So we do not bother. You can see that when we are selfish, we do not love religion, our country, our community, our fellow citizens, or anything good. We love only ourselves. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 65</h4><p>65. V. ON SELF-LOVE AND LOVE OF THE WORLD <p>Self-love is wishing well to oneself alone and not to others except on one's own account, not even to the church, one's country, any human community or fellow citizen. It also includes doing good to them solely for the sake of one's own reputation, honours and glory. If such a person does not see these ends in the good he does for others, he says in his heart 'What does it matter? Why am I doing this? What's in it for me?' and so he stops doing it. This shows plainly that a person in a state of self-love does not love the church, his country, his community or his fellow citizen, nor any good, but himself alone. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 65</h4><p>65. THE LOVE OF SELF AND THE LOVE OF THE WORLD. <p>THE LOVE OF SELF consists in wishing Well to One's Self alone, and not to others, except for the sake of one's self; not even to the Church, to one's country, to society, or to a fellow-citizen; and also in doing good to these solely for the sake of one's own reputation, honour, and glory; and unless the love of self sees these in the good which it does to them, it says at heart, "Of what consequence is it? Why should I do it? Of what advantage will it be to me?" And therefore does not do it. From this it is evident that he who is in the love of self, does not love either the Church, or his country, or society, or a fellow-citizen, or anything good, but himself only. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 65</h4><p>65. V. THE LOVES OF SELF AND OF THE WORLD.<p>The love of self consists in willing well to ourselves alone, and not to others except for the sake of ourselves, not even to the church, to our country, to any human society, or to a fellow-citizen; and also in doing good to them only for the sake of our own fame, honor, and glory; for unless it sees these in the goods which it does to others, it says in its heart, What matters it? why should I do this? and what advantage will it be to me? and so omits them. Whence it is plain that he who is in the love of self does not love the church, nor his country, nor society, nor his fellow-citizens, nor anything good, but himself alone. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 65 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>65. (V.) DE AMORIBUS SUI ET MUNDI.<p>AMOR sui est sibi soli bene velle, et non aliis nisi propter se; ne quidem ecclesiae, patriae, alicui societati humanae, aut concivi: ut et illis benefacere solum propter sui famam, honorem et gloriam; quae nisi videt in bonis quae illis facit, dicit corde suo, Quid refert, cur hoc, et quid inde mihi? et sic omittit. Unde patet quod is qui in amore sui est, non amet ecclesiam, nec patriam, nec societatem, nec concivem, nec aliquod bonum, sed se solum. </p>
