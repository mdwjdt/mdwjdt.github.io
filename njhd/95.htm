<h4 align="center"></h4><p>95、主的国是在一个还要更高层级上的邻舍，因为主的国由所有处于良善的人构成，包括地上的人和天上的人。因此，主的国是在其各个方面上的良善。爱主的国，就是爱处于良善的个人。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>95、主的国度是更高等级的友邻，因为主的国度由一切良善的人构成，包括世上的人和天堂里的天使。因此，主的国度是一切良善的总集合：人若爱主的国度，他也爱一切良善之人。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 95</h4><p>95. The Lord's kingdom is our neighbor on a still higher level because the Lord's kingdom is made up of all whose lives are devoted to doing good, both people on earth and people in the heavens. This means that the Lord's kingdom is goodness of all kinds gathered together. When we love this, we love every individual who is devoted to doing good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 95</h4><p>95. The Lord’s realm is our friend at an even higher level because it is made up of everyone who does good things, both on earth and in heaven. This means that the Lord’s realm consists of all the different kinds of goodness that exist, seen as a whole. When we love this, we love every person who does good things. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 95</h4><p>95. The Lord's kingdom is the neighbour in a still higher degree, for the Lord's kingdom consists of all who are in a state of good, both those on earth and those in the heavens. Thus the Lord's kingdom is goodness in all its aspects together. When this is loved, so are the individuals who are in a state of good. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 95</h4><p>95. The Lord's kingdom is a neighbour in a still higher degree; for the Lord's kingdom consists of all who are in good, on earth as well as in heaven. The Lord's kingdom, therefore, is good in the aggregate with all its quality, and when this is loved, every one who is in good is likewise loved. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 95</h4><p>95. The Lord's kingdom is the neighbor in a still higher degree, for the Lord's kingdom consists of all who are in good, both those on the earths, and those in the heavens; thus the Lord's kingdom is good with all its quality in the complex: when this is loved, the individuals are loved who are in good. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 95 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>95. Regnum Domini est proximus in adhuc superiori gradu, nam regnum Domini consistit ex omnibus qui in bono sunt, tam qui in terris quam qui in caelis; ita regnum Domini est Bonum cum omni ejus quali in complexu; hoc cum amatur, amantur singuli qui in bono sunt. </p>
