<h4 align="center"></h4><p>284、由于父在主里面，并且父与主为一，还由于我们必须信主，凡信祂的，就有永生，所以很明显，主就是神。圣言也教导，主就是神，如约翰福音：</p><p>起初有圣言，圣言与神同在，神就是圣言。万物是藉着祂造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的。圣言成了肉身，住在我们中间，我们也见过祂的荣耀，正是父独生子的荣耀。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）</p><p>以赛亚书：</p><p>因有一婴孩为我们而生，有一子赐给我们，政权必担在祂的肩头上；祂名称为奇妙、策士、神、勇士、永在的父、和平的君！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.6.htm">9:6</a>）</p><p></p><p>看哪，必有童女怀孕生子，祂的名必称为神与我们同在。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.14.htm">7:14</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太1.23.htm">1:23</a>）</p><p>耶利米书：</p><p>日子将到，我要给大卫兴起一个公义的苗裔，王必掌权、亨通；这是祂的名，人必称祂为耶和华我们的义。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.5.htm">23:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.6.htm">6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.15.htm">33:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.16.htm">16</a>）</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>284、因为圣父是在主里面，并且圣父和主原为一；又因为我们必须相信主，并且信祂的人有永生。所以显然主就是上帝。关于主就是上帝，《约翰福音》中的圣言这样教导：</p><p>太初有道。道与神同在，神就是道。万物籍着他造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是籍着他造的。道成了肉身，住在我们中间，并且我们见过他的荣光，正是父独生子的荣光（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）</p><p>在《以赛亚书》中：</p><p>因有一嬰孩為我們而生、有一子賜給我們．政權必擔在他的肩頭上。他名稱為奇妙、策士、全能的 神、永在的父、和平的君。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.6.htm">9:6</a>）。</p><p>同一部福音书中：</p><p>必有童女怀孕生子，人要称他的名为以马内利（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.14.htm">7:14</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太1.23.htm">1:23</a>）。</p><p>以及在《耶利米书》中：</p><p>日子将到，我要给大卫兴起一个公义的苗裔，他将掌王权，将成功；他的名必称为耶和华我们的义（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.5.htm">23:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.6.htm">6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.15.htm">33:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.16.htm">16</a>）。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 284</h4><p>284. Since the Father is in the Lord and the Father and the Lord are one, and since we are to believe in the Lord and whoever believes in him has eternal life, we can see that the Lord is God. The Word tells us that the Lord is God, as in John:<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made through him, and nothing that was made came about without him. And the Word became flesh and lived among us; and we saw his glory, glory like that of the only-begotten child of the Father. (<a href="3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_3.htm">3</a>, <a href="3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>)<p>In Isaiah:<p>A Child has been born to us; a Son has been given to us. Leadership will be upon his shoulder, and his name will be called God, Hero, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. (<a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>)<p>Again:<p>A virgin will conceive and give birth, and the [child's] name will be called "God with us. " (<a href="3927/isaiah_7_14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_1_23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>)<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>Behold, the days are coming when I will raise up for David a righteous branch who will rule as king, and prosper. And this is his name: they will call him "Jehovah our Righteousness.

<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 284</h4><p>284. The Father is in the Lord, and they are one person. Also, we should believe in him, and if we do we will live forever. So you can see that the Lord is God. The Bible teaches that the Lord is God, as in this passage in John:<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.... Everything was made through him, and nothing that was made was made without him.... And the Word became physical, and lived with us. We saw his splendor — it was like the splendor of the Father’s only Son.

The government will rest on his shoulders. His name will be . . . God, Champion, Father forever, the peaceful Prince. (<a href="3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>)<p>Also in Isaiah:<p>A virgin will conceive and have a baby.... And his name will be “God with us.” (<a href="3927/isaiah_7_14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="3927/matthew_1_23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>)<p>And in Jeremiah:<p>Look! The day is coming . . . When I will lift up a righteous branch from David’s line, who will rule as King, and will prosper.... And this will be his name: Jehovah our Righteousness. (<a href="3927/jeremiah_23_5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="3927/jeremiah_33_15.htm">33:15-16</a>) </p>
