<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 28</h4><p>28. Will and Understanding<p>We have two abilities that make up our life, one called will and the other <i>understanding</i>. <sup>1</sup>They are distinguishable, but they are created to be one. When they are one, they are called the mind; so they are the human mind and it is there that all the life within us is truly to be found. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Latin words here translated "will" and "understanding" are <i>voluntas</i> and <i>intellectus</i>, respectively; the latter is also sometimes translated " <i>intellect</i>. " In Swedenborg's use, however, <i>intellectus</i> has a somewhat broader connotation than understanding or intellect has today, one more consonant with the use of the Latin word in the system of the Scholastics. For example, in the philosophy of the major figure of Scholastic thought, Thomas Aquinas (1224 or 1225-1274), which underlies the terminology of much of philosophical language up to and including Swedenborg's time, <i>intellectus</i> encompasses all of what we associate with the faculties of mind, not only the capacity to reason and understand, but the capacity to perceive ideas in the abstract, as well as the mind's ability to be aware of itself (Shallo 1923, 115-116). The complementarity of will and intellect is also something Swedenborg shares with Scholastic thought. For an overview of the relationship between the will and the intellect, see <i>True Christianity</i> <a href="../tcr/397.htm">397</a>; for a detailed and extensive account of their interaction as analogous to that of the heart and the lungs, see <i>Divine Love and Wisdom</i> <a href="../dlw/394.htm">394-431</a>. For discussion of the related term "intellectual truth," see note 1 in <a href="26.htm">New Jerusalem 26</a> above. For further discussion of the will and the understanding, see note 1 in <a href="33.htm">New Jerusalem 33</a> below. [GFD, RS, JSR] </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 28</h4><p>28. Chapter 2. Motivation and Understanding<p>As human beings, we have two capabilities that make up our life: motivation and understanding. These capabilities are distinct from each other, but they are created so that they form a single entity. Taken together, they are called the mind. These capabilities are the human mind, and that is where all our life force is. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 28</h4><p>28. II. ON THE WILL AND THE INTELLECT <p>A person has two faculties which give him life: one is called the will, the other the intellect. These are quite distinct, but created to form one, and when they are one they are called the mind. The human mind therefore is composed of these two parts, and the whole of a person's life is located there. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 28</h4><p>28. THE WILL AND THE UNDERSTANDING. <p>MAN has two faculties which constitute his life: the one is called the Will, and the other the Understanding. These are distinct from each other, but so created as to form one; and when they are one, they are called The Mind. Wherefore they are the human mind; and the whole life of man is in them. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 28</h4><p>28. II. THE WILL AND THE UNDERSTANDING.<p>Man has two faculties which make his life; one is called the Will, and the other the Understanding. These faculties are distinct from each other, but are so created that they may be one; and when they are one they are called the Mind. Of these, then, the human mind consists; and the whole life of man is there. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 28 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>28. (II.) DE VOLUNTATE ET INTELLECTU.<p>SUNT homini binae facultates, quae faciunt vitam ejus; una vocatur Voluntas, et altera Intellectus. Illae inter se distinctae sunt, sed ita creatae ut unum sint, et cum unum sunt vocantur Mens; quare mens humana illae sunt, et omnis vita hominis ibi. </p>
