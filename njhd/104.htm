<h4 align="center"></h4><p>104、因此，仁爱是一种内在情感，人出于这种情感而愿意行善，并且不求回报；其生命的快乐就在于行善。那些出于内在情感而行善的人在他们所思所言，所愿所行的每一件事上都拥有仁爱。当良善为邻舍时，可以说就其内层而言，一个人或一位天使就是仁爱。仁爱延伸的范围就是如此广泛。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>104、因此仁爱是一种内在意愿，它使人乐意行为良善，不是为了回报，而是他生命的快乐在于此。由内在意愿去行善的人，他所思所讲的每件事里都有仁爱，仁爱也在他的意志和行动里。无论是天使还是世上的人，只要对他的友邻持守良善，他的深层内在就是仁爱的。 这显示仁爱的内涵是何等广阔。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 104</h4><p>104. Caring, then, is an inner desire that makes us want to do what is good, not because we are hoping for a reward but because doing it is the joy of our life. <p>When we are doing good as the result of an inner desire to do so, caring is present in every detail of what we are thinking and saying, what we are intending and doing. Whether we are angels or people [still on earth], if we hold goodness to be our neighbor, it can be said that in respect to our deeper natures we have become caring itself. That shows how far caring is able to go. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 104</h4><p>104. So kindness is an inner desire that makes us want to do good things even if we do not get anything in return. It is the joy of our life to do them. When we do good things from this inner desire, there is kindness in everything we think, say, want, and do. You could even say that as people or as angels, when we think of goodness as our friend, we are kindness in our inner self. That is how broad kindness is. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 104</h4><p>104. So charity is an internal affection causing a person to wish to do good, and this without recompense; it is his pleasure in life to do this. Those who are moved by an internal affection to do good, have charity in each single thought and utterance, in each single wish and action. When good is his neighbour, a person or an angel can be said to be charity as regards his interiors. That is how far charity extends. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 104</h4><p>104. Charity, therefore, is an internal affection, from which a man wills to do good, and indeed without any [desire of] recompense; the delight of his life consists in doing such good. With those who do good from an internal affection there is charity in everything they think and say, will and do. It may be said, that a man or an angel, as to their interiors, are charity, when good is the neighbour with them. So wide is the scope of charity. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 104</h4><p>104. Charity therefore is an internal affection, from which man wills to do good, and this without remuneration; the delight of his life consists in doing it. With them who do good from internal affection, there is charity in each thing which they think and speak, and which they will and do; it may be said that a man and an angel, as to his interiors, is charity, when good is his neighbor. So widely does charity extend itself. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 104 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>104. Charitas itaque est affectio interna, ex qua homo vult bonum facere, et hoc absque remuneratione; ejus jucundum vitae est id facere. Illi qui ex affectione interna bonum faciunt, in singulis quae cogitant et loquuntur, et quae volunt et agunt, est charitas; dici potest quod homo et angelus quoad interiora sua sit charitas, cum bonum ei est proximus. Tam late se extendit charitas. </p>
