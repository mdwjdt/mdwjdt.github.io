<h4 align="center"></h4><p>174、人并未从父母出生在属灵生命中，而是出生在属世生命中。属灵生命在于爱神高于一切并爱邻如己；事实上，按照主在圣言中所教导的信之诫命如此行。然而，属世生命在于爱自己、爱世界超过邻舍，甚至超过神自己。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>174、人从父母出生得到的不是属灵生命，而是物质生命。属灵生命在于爱主超过爱一切，爱友邻就像爱他自己，并且根据主在圣言中教导的信仰教训这样做。但是物质生命在于爱自己和爱世界超过爱友邻，且实际上超过爱上帝祂自己。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 174</h4><p>174. We are born by our parents into an earthly life, but not into a spiritual life. A spiritual life is loving the Lord above all and loving our neighbor as ourselves, and doing so by following the precepts of faith that the Lord has taught us in the Word. In contrast, an earthly life is loving ourselves and the world more than we love our neighbor, and in fact more than we love God himself. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 174</h4><p>174. We are not born from our parents into a spiritual life, but into a physical life. Spiritual life is loving God more than anything else, and loving other people as much as we love ourselves. We should do this according to the rules of faith that the Lord taught in the Bible. But physically-minded life is loving ourselves and material things more than other people, and even more than God himself. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 174</h4><p>174. The life one has by being born of one's parents is not spiritual but natural life. Spiritual life is loving God above all, and loving the neighbour as oneself, and doing this in accordance with the commandments of faith, which the Lord taught in the Word. Natural life, however, is loving oneself and the world more than the neighbour, in fact, more than God Himself. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 174</h4><p>174. Of his parents a man is not born into spiritual life, but into natural life. Spiritual life consists in loving God above all things and the neighbour as one's self; and indeed according to the precepts of faith which the Lord has taught in the Word. Natural life, however, consists in loving one's self and the world more than the neighbour, yea, more than God Himself. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 174</h4><p>174. Man is not born of his parents into spiritual life, but into natural life. Spiritual life consists in loving God above all things, and in loving his neighbor as himself, and this according to the precepts of faith, which the Lord has taught in the Word. But natural life consists in loving ourselves and the world more than the neighbor, yea, more than God Himself. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 174 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>174. Homo a parentibus non nascitur in vitam spiritualem, sed in vitam naturalem. Vita spiritualis est amare Deum supra omnia, et amare proximum sicut seipsum, et hoc secundum praecepta fidei, quae Dominus in Verbo docuit: vita autem naturalis est amare se et mundum prae proximo, immo prae Ipso Deo. </p>
