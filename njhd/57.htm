<h4 align="center"></h4><p>57、一个人的性质完全取决于主导他生命的东西，这就是把人彼此区分开来的东西。如果他是良善的，他的天堂性质就照这良善而形成；如果他是邪恶的，他的地狱性质就照这邪恶而形成。它构成他的意愿本身、自我和性质，因为它是其生命的真正存在。死后它无法改变，因为它就是这个人自己。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>57、一个人是什么样的全然取决于何事主导他。他也因此而区别于他人。如果他是良善的，他据此构建他的天堂；如果他是邪恶的，他也据此营造他的地狱。这就是他的主导欲，他的自我和他的人格。因为这是构成他生命的基础，死后也不会改变。因为这就是人自己。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 57</h4><p>57. The way we are is entirely determined by what controls our life. This is what distinguishes us from each other. This is what determines our heaven if we are good and our hell if we are evil. It is our essential will, our self, and our nature. In fact, it is the underlying reality of our life. It cannot be changed after death because it is what we really are. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 57</h4><p>57. Everything about us comes from the primary tendency of our life. This is what distinguishes us from other people. If we are good we make our heaven according to it, and if we are bad we make our hell according to it. It is our basic motivation, our personality, and our character, since it is the reality of our life. It cannot be changed after death because it is our essential self. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 57</h4><p>57. A person's character is determined by the dominant factor in his life, and this is what distinguishes him from other people. This factor makes his heaven, if he is good, his hell if evil. It is his real will, his self and his nature, for it is the real essence of his life. It cannot be changed after death, for it really is the person. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 57</h4><p>57. A man is altogether of such a quality as is that which rules his life; by this he is distinguished from others; and the nature of his heaven, if he is good, is formed according to it; and also the nature of his hell, if he is bad. It constitutes his very will, his own Self (proprium), and his character; for it is the very Esse of his life, which cannot be changed after death; because it is the man himself. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 57</h4><p>57. Man is altogether of such a quality as the ruling principle of his life is; by this he is distinguished from others; according to this is his heaven if he be good, and his hell if he be evil. It is his will itself, his proprium, and his nature, for it is the very esse of his life: this cannot be changed after death, because it is the man himself. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 57 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>57. Homo prorsus talis est, quale est ejus vitae dominans; per hoc distinguitur ab aliis; secundum hoc fit ejus caelum si bonus, et fit ejus infernum si malus; id est ipsa ejus voluntas ejus proprium, et ejus natura, est enim ipsum esse vitae ejus: hoc post mortem mutari non potest, quia id est ipse homo. </p>
