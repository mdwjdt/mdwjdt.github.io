<h4 align="center"></h4><p>288、整个基督教界都接受的信经以这些话声称，主的神性和人性（译注：人性即人身）是一个位格：基督虽为神，亦为人，然非为二，乃为一基督；合为一，乃由位格为一；如灵与身成为一人，神与人成为一基督。这些话取自《亚他那修信经》。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>288、整个基督教世界所接受的信仰宣认，主的神性和人性集于一体，此宣认如下：</p><p>尽管基督既是上帝也是人，但祂不是两位，而是一位基督；的确，祂全然是一位，是一个人；因为正如灵魂和身体是一个人，所以上帝和人也是一位基督。</p><p>这是来自亚他那修信经。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 288</h4><p>288. According to the statement of faith accepted throughout the whole Christian world, the divinity and the humanity of the Lord together make one person. That statement reads as follows:<p>Although Christ is God and a human being, yet he is not two, but one Christ. Indeed, he is one altogether, one person. Therefore as the body and the soul are one human being, so God and a human being are one Christ. <p>This is from the Athanasian Creed. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Athanasian Creed is a very old Christian creed of disputed date and authorship. Beginning in the ninth century it was ascribed to Athanasius (around 295-373), a bishop of Alexandria, but that ascription was strongly questioned as early as the 1600s (Schaff 1931, 1:35). A standard Latin version of the creed appeared in the 1756 Leipzig edition of <i>The Book of Concord</i>, and Swedenborg's pattern of reference to and quotation from the creed suggests that he acquired that volume in 1768. Before that time, he seems to have quoted his own translation into Latin, apparently based on an English version that appeared in the prayer book of the Anglican Church, the Book of Common Prayer. (Swedenborg himself hints at this source in <i>Revelation Explained</i> [= Swedenborg 1994-1997a] <a href="../ae/1091.htm">1091:1</a>, and he is known to have owned a copy of the 1711 edition of the prayer book at the time of his death.) It is not surprising, then, that Swedenborg's translation is different from the standard Latin version in many respects; but a word-for-word comparison of the standard text with his version of the entire document in <i>The Lord</i> <a href="../lord/56.htm">56</a> shows that he in fact weaves phrases and paraphrases of the creed into striking new juxtapositions. In the present passage, Swedenborg combines verse 34, part of verse 36, and verse 37 of the creed into continuous text. His paraphrase of verse 36 in particular is more emphatic than the standard Latin version and the version in the Book of Common Prayer of 1711, where instead of the wording Swedenborg gives, "Indeed, he is one altogether, one person," the creed gives "One altogether . . . by unity of person. " In interpretation as well, his position differs from traditional views; in a discussion in a later work of the same passage from the creed, he acknowledges as much: "Admittedly, people take this to be a union between an eternally begotten Son of God and a Son born in time; but God is one, not three. Therefore when this is taken to be a union with the one God from eternity then the position in the Athanasian Creed agrees with the Word" ( <i>True Christianity</i> <a href="../tcr/98.htm">98</a>). For one of the better Latin texts of the creed, see Schaff 1931, 2:66-71. For the full text of the creed in English, see Schaff as cited or Kolb and Wengert 2000, 23-25. Swedenborg wrote an outline for an entire work on the subject of this creed; see <i>Commentary on the Athanasian Creed</i> (= Swedenborg 1994-1997b, 6:571-634). On Swedenborg's encounter with Athanasius in the spiritual world, see <i>Commentary on the Athanasian Creed</i> <a href="../ath/43.htm">43</a>and <i>Spiritual Experiences</i> (= Swedenborg 1998-2013) <a href="../se/5959.htm">5959</a>.

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 288</h4><p>288. The creed accepted throughout the Christian world declares that the Lord's divinity and His humanity are one person, in these words: <p>Although Christ is God and man, still there are not two, but one Christ. Rather, he is completely one and only one person, because, just as the body and the soul are one man, so too God and man are one Christ. <p>These words are from the Athanasian Creed. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 288</h4><p>288. That the Lord's Divine and Human are one Person, is in accordance with the creed received throughout the whole of the Christian world; which is as follows: "Although Christ is God and Man, still He is not two, but one Christ; one altogether, by unity of person. For as the body and soul are one man, so also God and Man are one Christ." These words are taken from the Athanasian Creed </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 288</h4><p>288.

<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 288 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>288. Quod Divinum et Humanum Domini sit una persona, est ex fide recepta in toto Christiano orbe, quae talis est: -<p>"Quamvis Christus est Deus et Homo, usque tamen non est duo, sed unus Christus; immo est prorsus unus et unica Persona; quia sicut corpus et anima sunt unus homo, ita quoque Deus et Homo est unus Christus."<p>Haec e Symbolo Athanasii. </p>
