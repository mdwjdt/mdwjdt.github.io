<h4 align="center"></h4><p>286、在教会，众所周知，主从耶和华父成孕，因而自成孕时祂就是神；还知道，祂带着整个身体复活，因为祂在坟墓中什么都没留下。后来祂向门徒确认了这一点，说：</p><p>你们看我的手，我的脚，是我自己。摸我看看！灵无肉无骨，你们看，我是有的。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.39.htm">24:39</a>）</p><p>祂虽是一个有肉有骨的人，却仍能穿过关闭的门进来，在显明祂自己之后，就消失不见了（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.19.htm">20:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.26.htm">26</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.31.htm">24:31</a>）。这与所有人都不同，因为人仅在灵方面复活，但在身体方面不能复活。因此，当主说，祂与灵不同时，意思是说，祂与其他任何人都不同。由此明显可知，主里面的人身也是神性。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>286、教会知道，主是从耶和华父神受孕而生的，因此，主是从上帝受孕；众所周知祂完全从死里复活了，在坟墓中什么都没留下。祂后来也向门徒们证实，说：</p><p>你们看我的手、我的脚，就知道实在是我了。摸我看看；魂无骨无肉，你们看，我是有的（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.39.htm">24:39</a>）。</p><p>尽管祂是有骨有肉的活人，却仍能穿过关闭的门进来，并且在展示祂自己以后，消失不见（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.19.htm">20:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.26.htm">26</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.31.htm">24:31</a>）。这一点与所有其他的人不同，因为人死后复生的仅是灵体，而非肉体，因而当祂说祂不是一个魂时，祂其实是说祂与其他人不同。因此很明显主的人身也是神。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 286</h4><p>286. The church knows that the Lord was conceived by Jehovah the Father and was therefore God from his conception. It also knows that he rose with his whole body, since he left nothing in the tomb. He assured his disciples of this later when he said, "See my hands and my feet-that it is I myself. Touch me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have" (<a href="3927/luke_24_39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>). And yet even though he was human in having flesh and bones, he entered through closed doors and vanished after he had revealed himself (<a href="3927/john_20_19.htm">John 20:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_20_26.htm">26</a>; <a href="3927/luke_24_31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>). <p>It is different for everyone else. We rise again only in our spirits, not in our bodies, so when he said that he was not like a spirit, he was saying that he was not like anyone else. <p>We can see from this that even the human part of the Lord is divine. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 286</h4><p>286. Christians know that the Lord was conceived from Jehovah the Father, which means he was conceived from God. We also know that he rose from death with his whole body, since nothing was left in the tomb. Afterwards, he assured his disciples of this when he said, “Look at my hands and feet, and you will see that it is I. Touch me and see. A spirit does not have bone and muscle as you can see I do” (<a href="3927/luke_24_39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>).<p>Even though he was a person with bone and muscle, he came into the room through closed doors, and after he let them know who he was, he disappeared (<a href="3927/john_20_19.htm">John 20:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_20_26.htm">26</a>; <a href="3927/luke_24_31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>).<p>With people it is different. When we rise from death, we keep only our spirit, and not our physical body. So when he said that he was not like a spirit, he was saying that he was not like any other person. So you can see that the human part of the Lord is also divine. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 286</h4><p>286. It is well known in the church that the Lord was conceived of Jehovah the Father, and was thus by conception God; also that He rose again in His whole body, for He left nothing in the tomb. He subsequently confirmed His disciples in this belief, saying: <p>Look at my hands and my feet to see that it is really I. Touch me and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see me have. <a href="3927/luke_24_39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>. <p>Although He was man having flesh and bones, He still passed in through closed doors, and after revealing Himself became invisible (<a href="3927/john_20_19.htm">John 20:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_20_26.htm">26</a>; <a href="3927/luke_24_31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>, <a href="3927/luke_24_36.htm">36</a>). This is not what happens to every human being, for they only rise again in the spirit, not in the body. When therefore He said that He was not like a spirit, He meant that He was not like any other human being. From this it is plain that in the Lord His humanity too was divine. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 286</h4><p>286. It is known in the Church that the Lord was conceived from Jehovah the Father, and that thus from conception He was God; also, that He rose again with the whole body, for He left nothing behind in the sepulchre; on this subject also He afterwards confirmed His disciples, saying, "Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I Myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath, not flesh and bones, as ye see Me have" (<a href="3927/luke_24_39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>); and although He was a man in respect to flesh and bones, He still entered through closed doors; and after He had manifested Himself, He became invisible (<a href="3927/john_20_19.htm">John 20:19</a>, <a href="3927/john_20_26.htm">26</a>; <a href="3927/luke_24_31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>) - different altogether from what is the case with every man; for he rises again solely as to his spirit, and not as to his body. In saying therefore, that He was not like a spirit, the Lord said that He was not like another man. From this it is evident that the Human in the Lord is also Divine. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 286</h4><p>286. That the Lord was conceived from Jehovah the Father, and thus was God from conception, is known in the church; and also that He rose again with the whole body, for He left nothing in the sepulchre; of which He also afterwards confirmed the disciples, saying:<p>See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; feel Me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see Me have (<a href="3927/luke_24_39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>).<p>And although He was Man as to flesh and bones, still He entered through the closed doors, and, after He had manifested Himself, became invisible (John 20: <a href="3927/john_20_19.htm">19</a>, <a href="3927/john_20_26.htm">26</a>; <a href="3927/luke_24_31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>). The case is otherwise with every man, for man only rises again, as to the spirit, and not as to the body, wherefore when He said, that He is not as a spirit, He said that He is not as another man. Hence it is evident that the Human in the Lord is also Divine. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 286 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>286. Quod Dominus conceptus sit a Jehovah Patre, et sic a conceptione Deus, notum est in ecclesia; et quoque quod resurrexerit cum toto corpore, nam nihil reliquit in sepulcro; de quo etiam postea confirmavit discipulos, dicendo,<p>"Videte manus meas et pedes meos, quod Ipse Ego sim; palpate Me et videte; nam spiritus carnem et ossa non habet, sicut Me videtis habere" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_286/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_24_39" target=_top>Lucas 24:39</a>);<p>Et tametsi fuit Homo quoad carnem et ossa, usque intravit per fores clausas, ac postquam Se manifestavit, invisibilis factus est (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_286/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_20_19" target=_top>Johannes 20:19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_286/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_20_26" target=_top>26</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_286/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_24_31" target=_top>Lucas 24:31</a>.) <sup id="fn141_1">1</a></sup>Secus fit omni homini, homo enim modo quoad spiritum, et non quoad corpus resurgit; quare cum dixit quod non sit sicut spiritus, dixit quod non sit sicut alius homo.
