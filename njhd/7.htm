<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷及其属天的教义》 第7节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>7、对接下来所说的教义，补充以下内容。教义也来自天堂，因为它来自圣言的灵义，而圣言的灵义与天上的教义是一样的，因为天上也有一个教会，和地上一样。天上有圣言和取自圣言的教义，有教堂和讲道，也有教会和民间机构。简言之，天上的事物与地上的事物之间的唯一区别是：天上的一切事物都处于一种更完美的状态，因为那里的所有人都是属灵的，属灵事物在完美性上远远超过属世事物。关于天上存在这类事物，可参看《天堂与地狱》一书全文，尤其参看以下内容：天上的管理形式（<a href="../hh/213.htm">213</a>-<a href="../hh/220.htm">220</a>节）；天上的神性敬拜（<a href="../hh/221.htm">221</a>-<a href="../hh/227.htm">227</a>节）。由此明显可知“由神那里从天而降的圣城新耶路撒冷”表示什么。不过，现在我需要回到为新教会而存在，被称为天堂教义的教义本身，因为它已经从天堂被揭示给我。毕竟，传达该教义才是本书的目的。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>7、对以下篇章会提到的教义增加一些详情。教义也是来自天堂，因为它来自《圣经》的灵意，而《圣经》的灵意就是天堂里的教义。因为天堂和人间一样，也有教会。天堂里有来自《圣经》的圣言和教义，那里有教堂，教堂里有布道；那里也有教会和民事机构：简而言之，天堂事物和人间事物的唯一区别是天堂里的所有事物呈现出一个更完美的状态，因为那里的事物是属灵的，在完美性上，灵性事物极大地超过物质事物。关于天堂里的这些事物，可参阅描述天堂和地狱的专著，尤其是关于天堂治理的篇章（<a href="../ac/213.htm">213</a>-<a href="../ac/220.htm">220</a>）；以及关于天堂里的神圣敬拜的篇章（<a href="../ac/221.htm">221</a>-<a href="../ac/227.htm">227</a>） 。</p><p>通过这些事物，我们可以清楚的知道“圣城新耶路撒冷由 神那里从天而降”的意思。但我会继续论述新教会的教义，它也被称为天堂的教义，因为它在天堂之外向我揭示。这本书的计划就是阐述这教义。</p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p>介绍教义</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 7</h4><p>7. Turning specifically to the body of teaching that now follows, it too comes from heaven because it comes from the spiritual meaning of the Word, and the spiritual meaning of the Word is the same as the body of teaching that is found in heaven. You see, there is a church in heaven just as there is on earth. That is, the Word is there, there is a body of teaching drawn from the Word, and there are church buildings there with sermons being delivered-all because there are both ecclesiastical and civil institutions there. In brief, the only difference between things in the heavens and things on earth is that everything in heaven is in a more perfect state because all the people there are spiritual, and spiritual realities are far more perfect than earthly ones. On the fact that this is what heaven is like, see my book Heaven and Hell throughout, especially the chapters on forms of government in heaven (<a href="../hh/213.htm">213-220</a>) and divine worship there (<a href="../hh/221.htm">221-227</a>). <p>This shows what it means when it says that a holy city, a New Jerusalem, was seen coming down from God out of heaven. <p>But I need to turn now to the actual teachings for this new church, which are called "heavenly" because they have been revealed to me from heaven. That is, after all, the reason for this book. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 7</h4><p>7. The religious philosophy explained in this book is also from heaven. It comes from the Bible’s spiritual meaning, which is the same as the philosophy of the angels in heaven.<p>There is religion in heaven just as there is on earth, since they have the Bible there, and a religious philosophy that comes from the Bible. There are churches, and there is preaching in them. There are religious and political governments. The only difference between things in heaven and things on earth is that everything in heaven is at a higher stage of development; everything there is spiritual, and spiritual things are far more developed than material things.<p>From all this we can get an idea of what it means that the holy city, New Jerusalem, was seen coming down from God out of the sky.<p>Now we can start on the philosophy of the new religion. It is called a philosophy from heaven because it was revealed to me from heaven. This book was written especially to explain it. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 7</h4><p>7. To be specific about the teaching which will now follow, that too comes from heaven, because it is from the spiritual sense of the Word, and that sense is the same as the teaching which exists in heaven. For there is a church in heaven just as much as on earth. There the Word is to be found, and teaching from the Word; there are church buildings there, and sermons are preached in them. There too are to be found church and secular systems of government. In short, the only difference between things in the heavens and those on earth is that everything in the heavens is in a higher state of perfection, because all the people there are spiritual, and what is spiritual is immeasurably more perfect than what is natural. <p>These facts can make it clear what is meant by the holy city, New Jerusalem, being seen to come down from God out of heaven. But I shall now proceed to the actual teaching intended for the new church. Since this has been revealed to me from heaven, it is called heaven's teaching; for it is the aim of this book to convey this. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 7</h4><p>7. What in particular concerns the doctrine that now follows, is that it also is out of heaven, because it is from the spiritual sense of the Word; and the spiritual sense of the Word is identical with the doctrine which is in heaven. For there is a Church in heaven as well as on earth; for the Word is there, doctrine is there from the Word; temples are there, in which sermons are delivered; because ecclesiastical and civil governments are there. In a word, the only difference between the things which are in the heavens, and those which are on earth, is, that all the things in the heavens are in a state of greater perfection, because all who are there are spiritual, and spiritual things immensely exceed in perfection those that are natural. That in heaven there are such things, may be seen in the work concerning Heaven and Hell throughout, particularly in the chapter on Governments in Heaven, <a href="../hh/213.htm">Heaven and Hell 213-220</a>; and also in the chapter on Divine Worship there, <a href="../hh/221.htm">Heaven and Hell 221-227</a>. From this it may appear, what is meant by the holy city, New Jerusalem, being seen to come down from God out of heaven. But I shall proceed to the Doctrine itself, which is for the New Church, and which is called HEAVENLY DOCTRINE, because it was revealed to me out of heaven: for to deliver this doctrine, is the object of the present work. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 7</h4><p>7. To add a few words respecting the doctrine which is delivered in the following pages. This, also, is from heaven, because it is from the spiritual sense of the Word, and the spiritual sense of the Word is the same with the doctrine that is in heaven; for there is a church in heaven as well as on earth. In heaven there are the Word and doctrine from the Word, there are temples there, and preaching in them; there are also both ecclesiastical and civil governments there: in a word, the only difference between the things which are in heaven, and those which are on earth, is, that in heaven all things exist in a state of greater perfection, since those who are there are spiritual, and spiritual things immensely exceed in perfection those that are natural. That such things exist in heaven may be seen in the work concerning Heaven and Hell throughout, particularly in the article concerning Governments in Heaven (n. <a href="../hh/213.htm">213-220</a>); and also in the article on Divine Worship in Heaven (n. <a href="../hh/221.htm">221-227</a>). From these things it may be evident what is meant by "the holy city, New Jerusalem, was seen to descend from God out of heaven." But I proceed to the doctrine itself, which is for the New Church, and which is called Heavenly Doctrine, because it was revealed to me out of heaven; to deliver this doctrine is the design of the present book. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 7 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>7. Quod in specie Doctrinam concernit, quae nunc sequitur, est quoque illa ex caelo, quia est ex sensu spirituali Verbi, et sensus spiritualis Verbi est idem cum doctrina quae est in caelo: in caelo enim aeque ac in terra est ecclesia; est enim ibi Verbum, est doctrina ex Verbo, sunt ibi templa, et in illis fiunt praedicationes, nam sunt ibi regimina ecclesiastica et civilia; verbo, non alia intercedit differentia inter illa quae in caelis sunt et inter illa quae in terris, quam quod omnia in caelis in statu perfectiori sint, quia omnes qui ibi spirituales sunt, et spiritualia immensum excedunt naturalia perfectione. (Quod in caelis talia sint, videatur in opere De Caelo et Inferno ubivis, in specie in articulo De Regiminibus in Caelo, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_7/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_213" target=_top>213-220</a>; et in articulo De Cultu Divino ibi. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_7/swedenborg_de-coelo-et-de-inferno_221" target=_top>221-227</a>.) Ex his constare potest quid intelligitur per quod "sancta civitas, Nova Hierosolyma, visa sit descendere a Deo e caelo." Sed accedam ad ipsam Doctrinam, quae pro nova ecclesia; quae, quia mihi revelata est e caelo, Doctrina Caelestis vocatur: nam hanc dare, hujus operis institutum est. </p>
