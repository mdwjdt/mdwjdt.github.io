<h4 align="center"></h4><p>289、那些对神性持有三位格观念的人不可能拥有一神观；即便口头上说一位，他们仍思想三位。但那些对神性持有一位格里面的三位之人能拥有一神观，也能思想一位神。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>289、那些认为有三位神的人，无法接受一位上帝的观念。如他们嘴里说的是一位，心里想的却是三位。但是，若人对于神的观念为一位上帝具有三方面特性，他就能有一位上帝的概念、嘴里说一位神，心里也想着一位神。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 289</h4><p>289. People whose concept of divinity is a concept of three persons <sup>1</sup>cannot have a concept of one God. If they say "one" with their mouth, they still think "three. " However, people whose concept of divinity is a concept of three aspects in one person can have a concept of one God. They can say "one God," and they can think "one God" as well. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The doctrine of the Trinity, which holds that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit make one God, is held by the vast majority of Christian denominations, including the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant. Swedenborg, while accepting the concept of a Trinity, condemns an understanding of it that requires Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to be "three persons. " As he indicates in this passage, he believes this leads inevitably to a belief in three gods. For a thorough explication of Swedenborg's views of this topic, see <i>True Christianity</i> <a href="../tcr/163.htm">163-184</a>. [SS, RS] </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 289</h4><p>289. If we think of the divine as three people, we cannot have an idea of one God. Even if we say there is one God, we still think there are three. But if we think of the divine as three different parts of one person, we can have an idea of one God, say there is one God, and also think there is one God. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 289</h4><p>289. Those whose idea of the Deity is of three persons cannot have an idea of one God. Even if their lips speak of one, they think of three. But those whose idea of the Deity is of three in one person can have an idea of one God, say the words 'one God', and think of one God. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 289</h4><p>289. Those who hold concerning the Deity the idea of three persons, cannot have the idea of one God; if with the lips they say one, they still think of three. But those who in respect to the Deity have the idea of three in one Person, may have the idea of one God, and may also think of one God. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 289</h4><p>289. They who, concerning the Divinity, have the idea of three Persons, cannot have the idea of one God; if with the mouth they say one, still they think three; but they who, concerning the Divinity, have the idea of three in one Person, can have the idea of one God, and can say one God, and also think one God. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 289 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>289. Qui de Divinitate ideam trium personarum habent, non possunt ideam unius Dei habere; si ore dicunt unum, usque cogitant tres: at qui de Divinitate ideam trium in una Persona habent, illi possunt ideam unius Dei habere, ac dicere unum Deum, et quoque cogitare unum Deum. </p>
