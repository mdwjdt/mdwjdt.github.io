<h4 align="center"></h4><p>138、那些在世上没有获得良心的人在来世无法获得它，所以他们不能得救。原因在于，他们缺乏一个能让天堂，也就是主通过天堂流入的层面，以便主可以通过这个层面作工，并把他们引向祂自己。因为良心就是接受天堂流注的那个层面和容器。</p><p>《属天的奥秘》摘录</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>138、在世间没有获得良心的人，在来世也不能获得它，因此他不能得救。因为他的内在缺乏一个层面，就是主从天堂能够流入他的层面，主在这个层面上行事从而把人引向祂自己。而良心就是人心里的这个层面，它是接受来自天堂灵流的容器。</p><p>摘自《属天的奥秘》</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 138</h4><p>138. If we do not develop a conscience in this world we cannot develop one in the other life and therefore we cannot be saved. This is because in that case we do not have a level into which heaven can flow and through which it can work-that is, a way in which the Lord can act by means of heaven to lead us to himself. This is because our conscience is the level within us into which heaven flows; it serves as the part of us that receives heaven's inflow. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 138</h4><p>138. If we do not accept conscience in the world, we cannot accept it in the other life either, which means we cannot be saved. We are missing the place inside of us that heaven flows into and works through — meaning the place the Lord works through to lead us toward himself. Conscience is the place in our minds where we receive what flows into us from heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 138</h4><p>138. Those who have not received a conscience in the world cannot receive one in the other life, so they cannot be saved. The reason is that they do not have a level into which heaven can flow and through which heaven can work. Heaven means the Lord working through heaven, and so drawing them to Himself. For conscience is a level of the mind capable of receiving inflow from heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 138</h4><p>138. Those who have not received conscience in this world, cannot receive it in the other life; wherefore, they cannot be saved. The reason is, that they have no plane into which heaven, that is, the Lord through heaven, may flow, and through which He may operate, and so draw them to Himself; for conscience is the plane and receptacle of the influx of heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 138</h4><p>138. They who have not received conscience in the world, cannot receive it in the other life; thus they cannot be saved. The reason is, because they have no plane into which heaven, that is, the Lord through heaven, may flow in, and by which He may operate, and lead them to Himself. For conscience is the plane and receptacle of the influx of heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 138 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>138. Qui conscientiam non receperunt in mundo, illi conscientiam non recipere possunt in altera vita, ita non possunt salvari. Causa est, quia illis non est planum in quod influat et per quod operetur caelum, hoc est, per caelum Dominus, et illos adducat ad Se; nam conscientia est planum et receptaculum influxus caeli. </p>
