<h4 align="center"></h4><p>214、此外，圣餐包括并收聚了设立在以色列教会中的神性敬拜的全部。因为该教会的敬拜主要由燔祭和献祭构成，燔祭和献祭被统称为“食物或饼”。也正因如此，圣餐是该敬拜的高潮。</p><p>《属天的奥秘》摘录</p><p>人若不知道圣餐的细节表示什么，就不可能知道圣餐包含什么（因为这些细节对应于属灵事物），所以我需要引用一些章节说明“身体”和“肉”，“饼”和“酒”，“吃”和“喝”表示什么，还需引用一些材料说明，作为以色列教会敬拜的核心的献祭被统称为“食物或饼”。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>214、另外，在犹太教会圣餐礼既包含也被理解成全部神圣敬拜。事实上在那类教会敬拜的主要部分即火祭和献祭被统称为“面饼”，因而在敬拜的圣事中圣餐为其高潮。</p><p>摘自《属天的奥秘》：</p><p>除非理解对应属灵事物的圣餐礼每一细节所代表的意思，否则无法知道圣餐蕴含着什么，因此我需要指出一些词如“身体”和“肉体”、“饼”和“酒”、“吃”和“喝”等的意思，以及其他一些事物，它们提示，被犹太教会视为敬拜核心的献祭被统称为“面饼”。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 214</h4><p>214. Furthermore, the Holy Supper includes and encompasses all the worship of God instituted in the Israelite church. In fact, the burnt offerings and sacrifices that were central to the worship of that church were collectively referred to as "bread. " <sup>1</sup>The Holy Supper, then, also serves as the culmination of all those practices. <p>From Secrets of Heaven<p>Since we cannot know what lies within the Holy Supper if we do not know the symbolism of its individual components (because these correspond to things that are spiritual), I need to present the meaning of "body" and "flesh," of "bread," of "wine," and of "eating" and "drinking," and also some material showing that the sacrifices that were central to the worship of the Israelite church were collectively referred to as "bread. "<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;The Hebrew word to which Swedenborg refers here as "bread" is לֶחֶם (leḥem). It is often used in the Bible in its broader sense of "foodstuffs. " For references to a few such passages, specifically to foodstuffs used in sacrifice, see <i>New Jerusalem</i> <a href="221.htm">221[2]</a>. [GFD] </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 214</h4><p>214. The holy supper also includes and embodies all the divine worship set up in the Israelite religion. The burnt offerings and sacrifices that made up most of that religion were all summed up in the single word “bread.” So the holy supper accomplishes what all those burnt offerings and sacrifices used to accomplish. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 214</h4><p>214. Moreover the Holy Supper includes and gathers together all the worship of God instituted in the Israelite church. For burnt offerings and sacrifices, which were the chief components of the worship of that church, were called by the single term 'bread'. As a result the Holy Supper is its culmination. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 214</h4><p>214. The Holy Supper, further, includes and comprises the whole of the Divine worship instituted in the Israelitish Church; for the burnt-offerings and sacrifices, in which the worship of that Church principally consisted, were termed in one expression "bread;" and hence, also, the Holy Supper is a summing up of that worship. <p>FROM THE HEAVENLY ARCANA. <p>Since it is impossible to know what is involved in the Holy Supper, unless the signification of each single thing therein is known - for they correspond to spiritual things - it will be necessary to adduce what is signified by body and flesh, what by bread and wine, and what by eating and drinking; and also to treat of the sacrifices, in which the worship of the Israelitish Church chiefly consisted, because they were called "bread." </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 214</h4><p>214. Besides, the Holy Supper includes and comprehends the whole of the Divine worship instituted in the Israelitish Church; for the burnt-offerings and sacrifices, in which the worship of that church principally consisted, in one expression were called "bread"; hence also the Holy Supper is its completion.<p>FROM THE ARCANA COELESTIA.<p>Since what is involved in the Holy Supper cannot be known unless it is known what its particulars signify, for they correspond to spiritual things, therefore some passages shall be quoted respecting what is signified by "body" and "flesh," by "bread" and "wine," and by "eating" and "drinking"; as also concerning the sacrifices, wherein the worship of the Israelitish church principally consisted, showing that they were called "bread." </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 214 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>214. Praeterea Sancta Cena includit et comprehendit omnem cultum Divinum institutum in Ecclesia Israelitica; holocausta enim et sacrificia, in quibus cultus illius ecclesiae principaliter constabat, una voce dicta fuerunt "panis:" inde etiam Sancta Cena est ejus complementum.<p>(Ex Arcanis Caelestibus.)<p>Quia non sciri potest quid Sancta Cena involvit, nisi sciatur quid singula ibi significant, nam illa correspondent spiritualibus, ideo afferendum est quid significat "corpus" et "caro," quid "panis," quid "vinum," quid "edere" et "bibere;" tum de sacrificiis, in quibus cultus Ecclesiae Israeliticae praecipue constabat, quod illa dicta fuerint "panis." </p>
