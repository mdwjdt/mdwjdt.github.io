<h4 align="center"></h4><p>146、由此明显可知何谓自由意志或自由选择，即：它是指按自由选择，或人自己的意愿的选择行善。那些被主引导的人就享有这种自由，被主引导的人是指那些为了良善和真理而爱良善和真理的人。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>146、由此也可以看到什么是自由选择，就是按照自己的选择或动机去行善，这是在主引导下的人的自由。当人因为良善和真理而爱良善和真理时，他就被主引导。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 146</h4><p>146. This shows us what freedom of choice is-namely, doing what is good by choice or intentionally; this is the freedom we have when we are being led by the Lord. We are led by the Lord when we love what is good and true because it is good and true. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 146</h4><p>146. You can see from this what “freedom of choice” is: it is doing good things from our own choice and motivation. When we are in this kind of freedom, we are being led by the Lord, which happens when we love goodness and truth because they are good and true. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 146</h4><p>146. From this it can be established what free will is, namely, doing good by choice or of one's own will. Those who are led by the Lord enjoy that freedom, and those led by the Lord are those who love good and truth for the sake of good and truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 146</h4><p>146. From this it may appear what is meant by the freedom of choice; namely, that it means doing good from choice, that is, from the will; and that those who are led by the Lord are in that freedom; but those are led by the Lord who love good and truth for the sake of good and truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 146</h4><p>146. From this it may appear what Free-will is; namely, that it consists in doing good from choice or will, and that they are in that freedom who are led by the Lord; and they are led by the Lord who love good and truth for the sake of good and truth. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 146 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>146. Ex his constare potest quid sit liberum arbitrium, quod nempe sit ex arbitrio seu ex voluntate facere bonum; et quod illi in eo libero sint qui ducuntur a Domino: et illi ducuntur a Domino qui amant bonum et verum propter bonum et verum. </p>
