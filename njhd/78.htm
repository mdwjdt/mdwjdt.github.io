<h4 align="center"></h4><p>78、简言之，爱自己、爱世界与爱主、爱邻完全对立；因此，爱自己和爱世界是地狱之爱，因为它们也在地狱掌权，并构成与人同在的地狱；而爱主和爱邻是天堂之爱。它们也在天堂掌权，并构成与人同在的天堂。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>78、简而言之，爱自己和爱世界完全与爱主和爱友邻对立。原因是爱自己和爱世界是地狱之爱，因为它们是地狱的主宰，并按地狱构建人的内心。相反爱主和爱友邻是天堂之爱，它们是天堂的主导，并照天堂的样式培植人心。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 78</h4><p>78. In a word, love for ourselves and love for the world are exact opposites of love for the Lord and love for our neighbor. Therefore love for ourselves and love for the world are hellish loves. They actually rule in hell, and for us as well they constitute hell. In contrast, love for the Lord and love for our neighbor are heavenly loves. They actually rule in heaven, and for us as well they constitute heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 78</h4><p>78. In short, selfishness and materialism are completely opposed to loving the Lord and loving other people. This means selfishness and materialism are hellish loves. They prevail in hell, and they also make hell in us. But loving the Lord and loving other people are heavenly loves. They prevail in heaven, and they also make heaven in us. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 78</h4><p>78. In short, self-love and the love of the world are the very opposites of love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour. Therefore self-love and love of the world are infernal loves, and they are dominant in hell; they also make a person's private hell. Love to the Lord, however, and love towards the neighbour are heavenly loves, and are dominant in heaven; they also make a person's private heaven. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 78</h4><p>78. In a word, the love of self and the love of the world are diametrically opposed to love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour; wherefore the loves of self and the world are infernal loves; they also reign in hell, and likewise constitute hell in man. But love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour are heavenly loves; they also reign in heaven, constitute heaven with man. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 78</h4><p>78. In a word, the love of self and the love of the world are altogether opposite to love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor; wherefore the love of self and the love of the world are infernal loves, for they also reign in hell, and also constitute hell with man; but love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor are heavenly loves. They also reign in heaven, and also constitute heaven with man. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 78 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>78. Verbo, amor sui et amor mundi sunt prorsus oppositi amori in Dominum et amori erga proximum; quare amor sui et amor mundi sunt amores infernales, regnant etiam in inferno, et quoque faciunt infernum apud hominem; amor autem in Dominum et amor erga proximum sunt amores caelestes, regnant etiam in caelo, et quoque faciunt caelum apud hominem. </p>
