<h4 align="center"></h4><p>175、每个人都从父母出生在爱自己、爱世界的邪恶中。因习惯性放纵可以说已经成为第二天性的的一切邪恶都传给了后代，因而相继从父母、祖父母、曾祖父母，以及往前推的一个长久世系传下来。因此，传下来的邪恶最终变得如此庞大，以至于人自己的整个生命只不过是邪恶。这邪恶的遗传链条只有通过在主的引导下过信与仁的生活才能被打破或断裂。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>175、每个人从父母出生得到爱自己和爱世界的邪恶。因习惯而得的每种邪恶就像是本性，它被后代所遗传。因此，它是一个长久世系，相继来自父母、祖父母、曾祖父母等，一直溯源向上。由此，累积的邪恶代代相传最后变得如此之强，以至人自己的全部生命除了邪恶什么也不是。这邪恶的持续积累不会被中断和改变，除非通过主引导的信仰和仁爱生命。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 175</h4><p>175. We are all born from our parents with the evils of love for ourselves and for the world. Every evil that has become part of someone's nature as a result of habitual indulgence is passed on to his or her progeny. Therefore we receive accumulated evil passed down from our parents, grandparents, and ancestors in a long chain going back into the past. The evil we derive from them has over time become so great that all our intrinsic characteristics are nothing but evil. <p>This continuous accumulation can be broken and changed only by a life of faith and caring from the Lord. </p> 
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 175</h4><p>175. We are all born with the bad traits of selfishness and materialism that we get from our parents. Every bad trait that has become second nature to us through long habit is passed on to our children. So these faults have been passed down from our parents, our grandparents, and our ancestors before them, one after the other, in a long chain stretching backwards. Finally, so many bad traits have been passed down to us that all of our own life is nothing but faults. The only way this continuing chain of bad traits can be broken and changed is by living in faith and kindness from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 175</h4><p>175. Each individual acquires from his parents by birth the evils of self-love and love of the world. Every evil which has by habitual indulgence become second nature is passed on to one's children, so in succession from parents, grandparents, and ancestors going far back. The extent of the evils thus passed on eventually becomes so great that the whole of a person's own life is nothing but evil. The chain of inheritance is not snapped or bent except by living in a state of faith and charity by the Lord's guidance. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 175</h4><p>175. Every human being of his parents is born into the evils of the love of self and the world; all evil which by habit has become, as it were, natural, is transmitted to the offspring; and thus successively from parents, grand-parents and ancestors, in a long series backwards. On this account the evil handed down becomes at length so great, that the whole of a man's own life is nothing but evil. This continuous derivation of evil is broken and altered, only through the life of faith and charity from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 175</h4><p>175. Every man is born of his parents into the evils of the love of self and of the world. Every evil, which by habit has acquired as it were a nature, is derived into the offspring; thus it descends successively from parents, from grandfathers, and from great-grandfathers, in a long series backwards; whence the derivation of evil at length becomes so great, that the whole of man's own life is nothing else but evil. This continual derivation of evil is not broken and altered, except by the life of faith and charity from the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 175 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>175. Unusquisque homo nascitur in mala amoris sui et mundi a suis parentibus. Omne malum, quod per habitum traxerat quasi naturam, derivatur in prolem; ita successive a parentibus, ab avis, et ab atavis longa retro serie: inde derivatio mali tandem fit tanta, ut omne vitae propriae hominis non sit nisi quam malum. Derivatum hoc continuum non frangitur et alteratur, quam per vitam fidei et charitatis a Domino. </p>
