<h4 align="center"></h4><p>270、凡有正确思维的人都能认识到，世上的高位和财富并不是真正的神性祝福，尽管人们喜欢如此称呼它们。因为它们会逝去，也会迷惑许多人，使他们远离天堂。永生及其幸福才是来自神性的真正祝福。这也是主在路加福音中所教导的：</p><p>为自己预备用不尽的财宝在天上，就是贼不能近、虫不能蛀的地方。因为你们的财宝在哪里，你们的心也在那里。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.33.htm">12:33</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.34.htm">34</a>）</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 270</h4><p>270. Anyone who weighs the matter properly can know that eminence and wealth in this world are not genuine divine blessings, even though we call them that because we enjoy them so much. They come to an end for us; and they also lead many of us astray and turn us away from heaven. No, the real blessings that come from the Divine are eternal life and the happiness it brings. This is what the Lord is teaching us in Luke:<p>Provide yourselves a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys; because where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. (<a href="3927/luke_12_33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>, <a href="3927/luke_12_34.htm">34</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 270</h4><p>270. If you think it out sensibly, you can see that status and wealth in the world are not real divine gifts, even though we may call them that because of the pleasure they give us. These things do not last, and meanwhile we get carried away by them so that we turn away from heaven. But eternal life and the happiness that comes with it are real gifts from the divine. The Lord taught this in Luke:<p>Provide secure wealth for yourselves in heaven, where thieves will not steal it and moths will not destroy it. Wherever your wealth is, your heart will be there also. (<a href="3927/luke_12_33.htm">Luke 12:33-34</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 270</h4><p>270. Anyone giving the matter due consideration can know that high position and riches in the world are not really Divine blessings, although people are pleased to call them that. For they pass away, and lead many astray, turning them away from heaven. Everlasting life and its happiness are the real blessings given by the Deity. This too is what the Lord teaches in Luke: <p>Make for yourselves a treasure which will not fail in the heavens, one where thieves do not penetrate, nor do grubs spoil it. For where your treasure is, there too will your heart be. <a href="3927/luke_12_33.htm">Luke 12:33-34</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 270</h4><p>270. Whoever considers rightly may know, that rank and wealth in the world are not real Divine blessings, although a man from pleasure in them calls them so - for they pass away, and also seduce many, and turn them away from heaven - but, that eternal life, and its felicity are real blessings which are from the Divine. This the Lord also teaches in Luke: "Provide for yourselves treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (<a href="3927/luke_12_33.htm">Luke 12:33-34</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 270</h4><p>270. Everyone who rightly considers, may know that eminence and opulence in the world are not real divine blessings, notwithstanding man, from his pleasure in them, calls them so; for they pass away, and also seduce many, and turn them away from heaven; but that eternal life, and its happiness, are real blessings, which are from the Divine: this the Lord also teaches in Luke:<p>Make to yourselves a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where the thief approacheth not, neither the moth corrupteth; for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also (<a href="3927/luke_12_33.htm">Luke 12:33, 34</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 270 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>270. Qui rite expendit, scire potest quod eminentia et opulentia in mundo non sint reales benedictiones Divinae, tametsi homo ex suo volupi illas ita vocat, transeunt enim, et quoque seducunt multos, et avertunt a caelo; sed quod vita aeterna et ejus felicitas sint reales benedictiones quae a Divino. Haec etiam docet Dominus apud Lucam,<p>"Facite vobis...thesaurum non deficientem in caelis, quo fur non pervenit, neque tinea corrumpit; ubi enim est thesaurus vester, ibi etiam cor vestrum erit" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_de-nova-hierosolyma-et-ejus-doctrina-caelesti_270/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_12_33-34" target=_top>Lucas 12:33-34</a>). </p>
