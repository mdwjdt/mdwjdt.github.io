<h4 align="center"></h4><p>60、作为一切良善和真理的源头的两种爱，就是刚才所说的对主之爱和对邻之爱，构成与人同在的天堂。因此，这些爱也是天堂里的主导爱。它们因构成与人同在的天堂，故也构成与他同在的教会。作为一切邪恶和虚假的源头的两种爱，就是刚才所说的自我之爱和尘世之爱，则构成与人同在的地狱。因此，这些爱也是地狱里的主导爱。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>60、一切良善和真理从其而来的两种爱，就是之前已被评述的爱，是爱主和爱邻舍，它们构成了人的天堂，因此它们也统治着天堂。由于它们构成人的天堂，它们也构成人的教会。一切邪恶和谬误从其而来的两种爱，就是之前已论及的爱，是爱自己和爱世界，它们构成了人的地狱，因此它们也统治地狱。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 60</h4><p>60. The two kinds of love that are the source of everything good and true (which as just stated are love for the Lord and love for our neighbor) make heaven for us, so they reign in heaven as well; and since they make heaven for us they also constitute the church. <p>The two kinds of love that are the source of everything evil and false (which as just stated are love for ourselves and love for this world) make hell for us and therefore reign in hell as well. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 60</h4><p>60. The two loves that everything good and true come from (loving the Lord and loving other people) make heaven in us, so they also prevail in heaven. Since they make heaven in us, they make religion in us too. The two loves that everything evil and false come from (selfish love and materialistic love) make hell in us, so they also prevail in hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 60</h4><p>60. The two loves which are the source of all kinds of good and truth, which, as just said, are love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour, are what make heaven in a person. These therefore are the ruling loves in heaven. And because they make a person's heaven, they also make the church for him. The two loves which are the source of all kinds of evil and falsity, which are, as just said, self-love and love of the world, make hell in a person. These therefore are the ruling loves in hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 60</h4><p>60. The two loves from which are all goods and truths, and which, as has just been observed, are love to the Lord, and love towards the neighbour, constitute heaven with man, and therefore also they reign in heaven; and since they constitute heaven with man, they also constitute the Church with him. The two loves from which all evils and falsities proceed, and which, as has just been said, are the love of self and the love of the world, constitute hell with man; wherefore also, they reign in hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 60</h4><p>60. The two loves from which are all goods and truths, and which, as has just been stated, are love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor, constitute heaven with man, and therefore they reign in heaven; and since they constitute heaven with man, they also constitute the church with him. The two loves, whence are all evils and falsities, and which, as has just been said, are the love of self and the love of the world, constitute hell with man; wherefore also they reign in hell. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 60 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>60. Bini amores ex quibus omnia bona et vera, qui sunt, ut dictum est, amor in Dominum et amor erga proximum, faciunt caelum apud hominem; quare etiam illi regnant in caelo; et quia faciunt caelum apud hominem etiam faciunt ecclesiam apud illum. Bini amores ex quibus omnia mala et falsa, qui sunt, ut dictum est, amor sui et amor mundi, faciunt infernum apud hominem; quare etiam illi regnant in inferno. </p>
