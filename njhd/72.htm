<h4 align="center"></h4><p>72、主导爱有两种，一种是对邻之爱，一种是自我之爱。这两种主导爱本质上完全互相对立。出于对邻之爱进行统治的人向所有人意愿良善，只喜欢发挥功用，因而只喜欢服务他人。服务他人就是出于良善的意愿向他们行善，并发挥功用。这是他的爱，这也是他内心的快乐。这种人乐意晋升到更高职位，但不是为了这些职位，而是为了那时他能在更大规模、更高层次上所发挥的功用。天上的统治就是这样。但出于自我之爱进行统治的人则不向任何人意愿良善，只向他自己和自己的小圈子意愿良善。他发挥功用是为了获得自己的尊贵和荣耀，这些对他来说是唯一的功用。他若服务他人，也是为了他能获得服务、尊贵和统治。他争取进步不是为了他所能实行的良善，而是为了获得显赫和荣耀，从而获得内心的快乐。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>72、有两种类型的主导欲，一种出自爱友邻，另一种来自爱自己。这两种主导欲在本质上是完全对立的。爱友邻为主导欲的人，意愿人人都好，他最高的乐趣是助人，为他人服务。出于对他人的美好愿望，服务他人，践行良善，做有益于他人的事。这是他的爱，他衷心喜悦去做的。地位越高，他越喜悦，不是因为提升了地位，而是因为他能更多，更好的服务于他人。这是天堂里的主导欲。相反，主导欲是爱自己的人，除了他自己和他圈子里的人，他不希望任何人好。他做事只是为了获得尊敬和荣耀，因为这是他心中唯一有意义的目标。对他而言，服务他人的目的只是为了被服侍、获得尊敬，或者被人尊从。他渴望高位，不是为了更好的践行良善，而是为了显赫和荣耀，以慰籍心灵。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 72</h4><p>72. There are two kinds of governing. One arises out of love for our neighbor and the other out of love for ourselves. Fundamentally, these two ways of governing are exact opposites. If we govern out of love for our neighbor, we wish good things for everyone. We love nothing more than being helpful and therefore serving others (serving others is doing good and useful things for them because we have goodwill toward them). This is what we love and what delights our hearts. The more we are promoted to higher office the happier we are; but this is not because of the office but because of the greater and higher service we can perform. This is the kind of governing that exists in heaven. <p>In contrast, if we govern out of love for ourselves, then we wish good things for no one but ourselves and our immediate circle. Any service we perform is to gain respect and glory for ourselves because that is the only outcome we consider useful; as far as we are concerned, the only reason for serving others is to be served and respected and obeyed. We strive for high office not because of the good things we can do but in order to bask in eminence and glory to our hearts' delight. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 72</h4><p>72. There are two kinds of power. One comes from loving other people, and the other comes from selfishness. In essence, these two kinds of power are complete opposites.<p>When our power comes from loving other people, we wish well to everyone. We love nothing more than doing useful things for other people and helping them. (Helping other people is doing good and useful things for them from good motives.) This is our love, and it is our heart’s enjoyment. When this is our state of mind, we are glad when we are placed in a high position — not because of the high position itself, but because we can be useful in many more ways, and on a larger scale. This is the kind of power that exists in heaven.<p>But when our power comes from selfishness, we do not wish well to anyone besides ourselves and our family. We do useful things only to increase our own status and fame, which are the only things we consider useful. We work for other people only to get them to work for us, and to gain status and power. We strive for high positions not for the good we can accomplish in them, but so that we will be prominent and famous, which is our heart’s delight. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 72</h4><p>72. There are two kinds of rule: one is the rule of love towards the neighbour, the other is the rule of self-love. These two kinds of rule are in essence diametrically opposed. One who rules from love towards the neighbour wishes the good of all, and loves nothing better than performing services, or being of service to others. Being of service to others is doing them good as the result of goodwill and performing services for them. This is what he loves, this is the pleasure of his heart. Such a person is pleased the higher the offices to which he is advanced, not for their own sake, but for the sake of the services which he is then able to perform in greater numbers and at a higher level. Ruling in heaven is like this. <p>But someone who rules from self-love wishes good to no one but himself and his own. Any services he performs are for the sake of his own honours and glory, which are the only services he recognises. If he is anyone's servant, it is so that he may be served, honoured, and exercise rule himself. He canvasses for advancement not for the sake of good actions he can perform, but to achieve eminence and a glorious position, and so to give pleasure to his heart. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 72</h4><p>72. There are two modes of exercising rule, the one is that of love towards the neighbour, and the other that of the love of self. These two kinds of rule are, in their essence, diametrically opposed to each other. He who exercises rule from love towards the neighbour, intends good to all; and he loves nothing more than to accomplish uses, and thus to serve others; but serving others means doing good, and performing uses to others on the ground of willing well to them; this is his love, and this constitutes the delight of his heart. Such a person rejoices also in the proportion that he is exalted to high posts of honour, not, indeed, on account of the posts of honour, but on account of the uses which he is then able to perform in greater abundance, and of greater excellence. A rule of this kind is exercised in the heavens. But he who rules from the love of self intends good to no one except himself and those who belong to him. The uses which he accomplishes, are for the sake of his own honour and glory, which are the only uses he recognizes. With him therefore the end in serving others is that he himself may be served and honoured, and that he may rule. He seeks posts of honour, not for the sake of the goods he may do, but that he may occupy a high position, and reap glory, and may enjoy therefrom his heart's delight. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 72</h4><p>72. There are two kinds of dominion, one that of love toward the neighbor, the other that of the love of self. These two kinds of dominion are in their essence altogether opposite to each other. He who rules from love toward the neighbor, wills good to all, and loves nothing more than to perform uses, thus to be of service to others. To serve others is to do good to them from good will, and to perform uses. This is his love, and this is the delight of his heart. He too, as far as he is elevated to dignities, is likewise glad; not, however, for the sake of the dignities, but for the sake of the uses which he is then able to perform in more abundance and in a greater degree. Such is the dominion in the heavens. But he who rules from the love of self wishes good to no one, but only to himself and his own. The uses which he performs are for the sake of his own honor and glory, which to him are the only uses. Serving others is to him for the end that he may be served, honored, and that he may rule. He seeks dignities, not for the sake of the goods he may perform, but to be in eminence and glory, and thence in the delight of his heart. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 72 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>72. Sunt duo dominii genera; unum est amoris ergo proximum, et alterum est amoris sui. Haec duo dominia sunt in sua essentia sibi prorsus opposita. Qui dominatur ex amore erga proximum, is vult omnibus bonum, et nihil plus amat quam usus praestare, ita servire aliis (servire aliis est aliis ex bene velle benefacere, et usus praestare); hoc ejus amor est, et hoc jucundum cordis ejus; is quoque quantum evehitur ad dignitates, tantum quoque laetatur, verum non propter dignitates, sed propter usus, quos tunc in pluri copia, et in majori gradu, praestare potest: tale dominium est in caelis. At qui dominatur ex amore sui, is vult nulli bonum, sed solum sibi et suis; usus quos praestat, sunt propter sui honorem et gloriam, quae ei sunt soli usus; servire aliis est ei propter finem ut serviatur, honoretur, et dominetur; ambit dignitates non propter bona quae praestet, sed ut in eminentia et gloria sit, et inde in sui cordis jucundo. </p>
