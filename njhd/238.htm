<h4 align="center"></h4><p>238、那些爱自己爱世界在里面占主导地位的人不知道什么是天堂和天堂的幸福。幸福能存在于除了爱自己和爱世界之外的其它任何爱里面，这对他们来说是难以置信的。而事实上，这些被视为目的本身的爱越被驱逐，天堂的幸福就越进入。一旦它们被驱逐，取代它们的幸福是如此之大，以至于超出所有人的理解能力。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>238、那些爱自己和爱世界为主导的人，不知道天堂和天堂的幸福是什么。他们不相信除了爱自己和爱世界以外，还有任何其他幸福来源。然而，人对属天幸福的感受程度取决于他放弃爱自己和爱世界的程度。这些被放弃之后随之而来的幸福感是如此美好，实在超乎想象。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 238</h4><p>238. People in whom love for themselves and love for the world are in control do not realize what heaven and heavenly happiness are. They cannot believe that happiness can be found in any kind of love other than self-love and love for the world. Yet the fact is that we feel the happiness of heaven to the extent that we put these loves aside as our goals. After these loves have been put aside, the happiness that follows is so great that it is beyond human comprehension. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 238</h4><p>238. When selfishness and materialism control us, we do not know what heaven or heavenly happiness are. It seems unbelievable to us that there could be any happiness in loving anything besides ourselves and material things. But as we take part in the happiness of heaven, our selfish and materialistic loves are put aside as goals. When those loves are gone, the happiness we feel goes far beyond anything we could possibly conceive of. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 238</h4><p>238. Those who are mastered by self-love and love of the world are ignorant about what heaven is and what the happiness of heaven is. It seems incredible to them that any loves other than these can possibly bring happiness. Yet the more those loves, regarded as ends in themselves, are banished, the more does the happiness of heaven enter in. The happiness which takes their place, once they are banished, is so great as to be beyond a human being's capacity to grasp. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 238</h4><p>238. Those with whom the love of self and the love of the world are dominant, do not know what heaven and heavenly happiness are; and it seems incredible to them that happiness should be possible in any other loves, than the above; when yet the happiness of heaven enters in proportion as the above loves are removed as ends. The happiness which succeeds on their removal is so great, as to exceed all human comprehension. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 238</h4><p>238. Those with whom the love of self and the love of the world reign, do not know what heaven and heavenly happiness are; and it appears incredible to them that happiness is given in any other loves than in them. Nevertheless, the happiness of heaven enters so far as the loves of self and the world, regarded as ends, are removed; and the happiness which succeeds on their removal is so great as to exceed all human comprehension. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 238 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>238. Illi apud quos amor sui et amor mundi regnant, non sciunt quid caelum et quid felicitas caeli, et incredibile illis apparet quod felicitas in aliis amoribus detur quam in illis; cum tamen tantum intrat felicitas caeli, quantum illi amores ut fines removentur: felicitas, quae illis remotis succedit, est tanta ut excedat omnem captum hominis. </p>
