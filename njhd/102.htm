<h4 align="center"></h4><p>102、其它例子也一样，无论一个人有无公职。如孩子对父母，父母对孩子；仆人对主人，主人对仆人；国民对国王，国王对国民。在这些人当中，凡履行职责是因为这是自己的职责，行公义是因为这是公义的人都是在实行仁爱。</p>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>102、这同样适用于人的所有其它方面，而无论他有无职位。例如孩子对父母，父母对孩子；仆人对主人，主人对仆人；国民对国王，国王对国民：无论何人出于责任的原则而履行责任，为了公正而践行公正，他就在实行仁爱。</p>

<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Teachings (New Century Edition 2020) 102</h4><p>102. It is the same for others whether they hold some office or not-children toward their parents, for example, and parents toward their children, servants toward their employers and employers toward their servants, subjects toward their monarch and monarchs toward their subjects. If they do their duty for the sake of duty and do what is fair for the sake of fairness, they are practicing caring. </p>
<h4 align="center">The Heavenly City (Woofenden translation 1993) 102</h4><p>102. This broader meaning of “kindness” applies to all the rest of us too, whether we have a job or not — children toward their parents and parents toward their children, workers toward their employers and employers toward the workers, citizens toward their leaders and leaders toward the citizens. When we fulfill our obligations because that is what we should do, and when we do what is fair because it is fair, then we are showing kindness. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Chadwick translation 1990) 102</h4><p>102. It is the same with other occupations, whether public office or not. So for instance, the attitude of children towards their parents, and of parents towards their children; of servants towards their masters, and of masters towards their servants; of subjects towards their king, and of a king towards his subjects. Any of them who do their duty because it is their duty, and justice because it is justice, are exercising charity. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Tafel translation 1911) 102</h4><p>102. The case is the same with the rest, whether they administer any public office, or not; thus with children in respect to parents, and with parents in respect to children; with servants in respect to their masters, and with masters in respect to their servants; with subjects in respect to their king, and with a king in respect to his subjects. Whoever among them does his duty from a sense of duty, and what is just from a sense of what is just, practises charity. </p>
<h4 align="center">The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine (Whitehead translation 1892) 102</h4><p>102. The case is the same in all other instances, whether a man be in any office or not; as with children towards parents, and with parents towards children; with servants towards masters, and with masters towards servants; with subjects towards the king, and with a king towards subjects: whoever of these does his duty from a principle of duty, and what is just from a principle of justice, exercises charity. </p>
<h4 align="center">De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus Doctrina Caelesti 102 (original Latin 1758)</h4><p>102. Simile est cum reliquis, sive in aliqua functione sint, sive non sint; ut cum liberis erga parentes, et cum parentibus erga liberos; cum servis erga dominos, et cum dominis erga servos; cum subditis erga regem, et cum rege erga subditos: qui ex illis debitum facit ex debito, et justum ex justo, is charitatem exercet. </p>
