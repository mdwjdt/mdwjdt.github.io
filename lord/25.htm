<h4 align="center"></h4><p>L25.⑵当论述审判时，主被称为“人子”，这一点从以下经文明显看出来，马太福音：</p><p>当人子在祂荣耀里降临的时候，祂要坐在祂荣耀的宝座上。把绵羊安置在右手边，山羊在左边。（马太福音25:31，33）</p><p>同一福音书：</p><p>当人子坐在祂荣耀的宝座上时，祂要审判以色列十二个支派。（马太福音19:28）</p><p></p><p>人子要在祂父的荣耀里来临。那时候，祂要照各人的行为报应各人。（马太福音16:27）</p><p>路加福音：</p><p>你们要时时警醒，使你们能配得站立在人子面前。（路加福音21:36）</p><p>马太福音：</p><p>在你们想不到的时刻，人子就来了。（马太福音24:44；路加福音12:40）</p><p>约翰福音：</p><p>父不审判什么人，乃将审判的事全交与子，因为祂是人子。（约翰福音5:22，27）</p><p>当论述审判时，主之所以自称“人子”，是因为一切审判都是照着圣言 里面的神性真理来执行的。主自己在约翰福音中说，这真理审判每个人：</p><p>若有人听见我的话却不信，我不审判他。我来本不是要审判世界。我所讲的圣言，在末日要审判他。（约翰福音12:47，48）</p><p></p><p>人子来不是审判世界，乃是叫世界藉着祂得救。信祂的人，不受审判；不信的人，已经受审判了，因为他不信神独生子的名。（约翰福音3:17，18）</p><p>主不审判任何人下地狱，不将任何人投入地狱；相反，是恶灵将自己扔了进去，这一事实可见于《天堂与地狱》一书（HH 545-550，574节）。耶和华，主，神儿子的“名”表示神性真理，因而也表示圣言，圣言来自祂，关乎祂，因而是祂自己。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 25</h4><p>25. The Lord is called the Son of Humanity when the subject is judgment. This we can tell from the following passages:<p>When the Son of Humanity comes in his glory, then he will sit on the throne of his glory and set the sheep on his right and the goats on the left. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_33.htm">33</a>)<p>When the Son of Humanity sits on the throne of his glory, he will judge the twelve tribes of Israel. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>)<p>The Son of Humanity is going to come in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay all people according to their deeds. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>)<p>Be wakeful at every moment, so that you may be found worthy to stand before the Son of Humanity. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_36.htm">Luke 21:36</a>)<p>The Son of Humanity is coming at an hour you do not expect. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_12_40.htm">Luke 12:40</a>)<p>The Father does not judge anyone; he has given all judgment to the Son, because he is the Son of Humanity. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_22.htm">John 5:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_27.htm">27</a>)<p>The reason the Lord calls himself the Son of Humanity when the subject is judgment is that all judgment is executed according to the divine truth that is in the Word. He himself says in John that this is what judges everyone:<p>If people hear my words but do not believe, I do not judge them. I have not come to judge the world. The Word that I have spoken will judge them on the last day. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>)<p>And in another passage,<p>The Son of Humanity came not to condemn the world but so that the world would be saved through him. Those who believe in him are not condemned; but those who do not believe have already been condemned because they have not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17-18</a>)<p>See Heaven and Hell <a href="../hh/545.htm">545-550</a>, <a href="../hh/574.htm">574</a> on the fact that the Lord never condemns anyone to hell or casts anyone into hell. Rather, evil spirits cast themselves in. The name of Jehovah, the Lord, or the Son of God means divine truth and therefore the Word as well, since this is from him and about him and therefore is he himself. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 25</h4><p>25. The Lord is called the Son of man when the subject is judgment. This is clear from the following:<p>When the Son of man comes in His glory..., then He will sit on the throne of His glory. And He will set the sheep on His right, and the goats on the left. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_33.htm">33</a>)<p>...when the Son of man sits on the throne of His glory..., He will judge the twelve tribes of Israel. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>)<p>...the Son of man will come in the glory of His Father..., and then He will repay each person in accordance with his works. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>)<p>Watch...always, that you may be held worthy...to stand before the Son of man. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_36.htm">Luke 21:36</a>)<p>...the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_12_40.htm">Luke 12:40</a>)<p>...the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son..., because He is the Son of man. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_22.htm">John 5:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_27.htm">27</a>)<p>The Lord calls Himself the Son of man when the subject is judgment because all judgment is made in accordance with the Divine truth that is in the Word. That this is what judges everyone is something the Lord teaches in John:<p>If anyone hears My words and yet does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world.... ...the Word that I have spoken, it will judge him in the last day. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>)<p>And elsewhere:<p>(The Son of man did not come) to judge the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. He who believes in Him is not judged; but he who does not believe is judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17-18</a>)<p>That the Lord does not judge anyone to hell or cast anyone into hell, but that it is the evil spirit himself who judges and casts himself, may be seen in the book <a href="../hh/545.htm">Heaven and Hell 545-550</a>, <a href="../hh/574.htm">574</a>.<p>The name of Jehovah, of the Lord, and of the Son of God, means Divine truth, thus also the Word, which originates from Him, is about Him, and so embodies Him. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Dick translation 1954) 25</h4><p>25. 2. THE LORD IS CALLED THE SON OF MAN WHEN JUDGMENT IS TREATED OF. This is evident from the following passages: <p>When the Son of Man shall come in His glory ... then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory. <p>And He shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_33.htm">33</a>. <p>When the Son of Man shall sit in the throne of His glory ... to judge the twelve tribes of Israel. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>. <p>The Son of Man shall come in the glory of His Father ... and then He shall reward every man according to his works. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>. <p>Watch ye therefore always ... that ye may be accounted worthy ... to stand before the Son of Man. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_36.htm">Luke 21:36</a>. <p>In such an hour as ye think not the Son of Man cometh. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_12_40.htm">Luke 12:40</a>. <p>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son ... because He is the Son of Man. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_22.htm">John 5:[22,]</a> <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_27.htm">27</a>. <p>The reason why the Lord calls Himself the Son of Man when judgment is being treated of is, because all judgment is effected according to Divine Truth, which is in the Word. That this judges every one the Lord Himself says in John: <p>If any one hear my words, yet believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world ... <p>The Word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>; and in another place: <p>The Son of Man came not to judge the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. <p>He that believeth on Him is not judged: but he that believeth not is judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17-18</a>. <p>That the Lord does not judge any one to hell, or cast any one down to hell; but that the evil spirit casts himself down, may be seen in the work HEAVEN AND HELL, Nos. 545-550, 574. By the name of Jehovah, of the Lord, and of the Son of God, is meant the Divine Truth, and consequently the Word, which is from Him, and concerning Him, and thus is Himself. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Potts translation 1904) 25</h4><p>25. That the Lord is called "the Son of man" when the Judgment is treated of, is evident from these passages: <p>When the Son of man shall come in His glory, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory, and He shall set the sheep on His right hand, and the goats on the left (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_25_33.htm">33</a>). <p>When the Son of man shall sit on the throne of His glory, He shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_19_28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>). <p>The Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father, and shall render to everyone according to his deeds (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_16_27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>). <p>Watch ye at every season, that ye may be accounted worthy to stand before the Son of man (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_36.htm">Luke 21:36</a>). <p>In such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_24_44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_12_40.htm">Luke 12:40</a>). <p>The Father judgeth no one, but hath given all judgment to the Son, because He is the Son of man (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_22.htm">John 5:22</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_27.htm">27</a>). <p>The reason why the Lord calls Himself "the Son of man" when the Judgment is treated of, is that all judgment is effected according to the Divine truth which is in the Word. That this judges everyone, is said by the Lord Himself in John: <p>If any one hear My words, and believe not, I judge him not, for I came not to judge the world. The Word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_47.htm">John 12:47-48</a>). <p>The Son of man has not come to judge the world, but that through Him it might be saved; he that believeth in Him is not judged; but he that believeth not is judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the Only-begotten Son of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17-18</a>). <p>(That the Lord judges no one to hell, and casts no one into hell, but that an evil spirit casts himself in, may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, <a href="../hh/545.htm">545-550</a>, <a href="../hh/574.htm">574</a>.) By "the name" of Jehovah, of the Lord, of the Son of God, is meant the Divine truth, and therefore also the Word, which is from Him, and about Him, and therefore is Himself. </p>
