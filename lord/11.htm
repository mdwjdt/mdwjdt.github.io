<h4 align="center"></h4><p>L11.主成全了律法的一切是指祂成全或应验了圣言的一切。这一点从经上提到祂成全或应验了圣经的一切，一切都已完成的经文明显看出来，如下列经文，路加福音：</p><p>耶稣进了会堂，站起来要诵读。有人把先知以赛亚的书交给祂，祂就打开，找到一处写着说：主的灵在我身上，因为祂膏立我，差遣我传福音给贫穷的人，医治心碎的人，宣告被掳的得释放，瞎眼的得看见，宣告主悦纳之年。于是把书卷起来，说，今天这经应验在你们耳中了。（路加福音4:16-21）</p><p>约翰福音：</p><p>你们查考圣经，因为它们为了作见证。（约翰福音5:39）</p><p>同一福音书：</p><p>现在要应验经上的话，同我吃饭的人，举起脚跟来踢我。（约翰福音13:18）</p><p></p><p>其中除了那灭亡之子，没有一个灭亡的，好叫经上的话得应验。（约翰福音17:12）</p><p></p><p>这要应验耶稣从前的话，你所赐给我的人，我没有失落一个。</p><p>马太福音：</p><p>耶稣对彼得说，把你的剑收回原处。若是这样，经上所说，事情必须如此的话，怎么应验呢？但这一切的事成就了，为要应验先知书上的话。（马太福音26:52，54，56）</p><p>马可福音：</p><p>人子要去了，正如经上指着他所写的，为要应验经上的话。（马可福音14:21，49）</p><p>同一福音书：</p><p>这就应了经上的话说，祂被列在罪犯之中。（马可福音15:28；路加福音22:37）</p><p>约翰福音：</p><p>这要应验经上的话说，他们彼此分了我的外衣，为我的里衣拈阄。（约翰福音19:24）</p><p>同一福音书：</p><p>这事以后，耶稣知道一切事已经完成了，为要使经上的话应验。（约翰福音19:28）</p><p></p><p>耶稣受了那醋，就说，完成了，就是应验了。（约翰福音19:30）</p><p></p><p>这些事成了，为要应验经上的话，祂的骨头一根也不可折断。经上又有一句说，他们要仰望自己所扎的人。（约翰福音19:36，37）</p><p>除此之外还有其它地方，那里引用了先知书的经文，但没有同时说，律法或经上的话应验了。祂在离世之前也教导门徒，整部圣言都是指着主写的，并且祂降世要应验圣言。这一点从下面这些话明显看出来，路加福音：</p><p>耶稣对祂的门徒说，你们可真蠢哪，先知所说的一切话，你们的心信得太迟钝了！基督受这些苦，又进入祂的荣耀，岂不是应当的吗？于是从摩西和众先知开始，凡经上所指着自己的话都给他们讲解明白了。（路加福音24:25-27）</p><p>同一福音书：</p><p>耶稣对祂的门徒说，这些就是我从前与你们同在之时所对你们讲的话：摩西的律法、先知的书和诗篇上所记的，凡指着我的话都必须应验。（路加福音24:44）</p><p>主在世时应验了圣言的一切，直到最小的事，这一点从祂自己的话明显看出来：</p><p>我实在对你们说：就是到天地都废去了，律法的一点一画也不能废去，直到一切都实现。（马太福音5:18）</p><p>从这些经文清楚看出，主成全了律法的一切，不是说祂成全了十诫，而是说成全或应验了圣言的一切。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 11</h4><p>11. To say that the Lord fulfilled all of the law is to say that he fulfilled all of the Word, as we can see from passages where it says that the Scriptures were fulfilled by him and that everything was brought to completion. See, for example, the following.<p>Jesus went into the synagogue and stood up to read. He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah. He unrolled the scroll and found the passage where it was written, “The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim release for the bound and sight for the blind, to preach the welcomed year of the Lord.” Then he rolled up the scroll and said, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_4_16.htm">Luke 4:16-21</a>)<p>You search the Scriptures, and yet they testify of me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_39.htm">John 5:39</a>)<p>... that the Scripture may be fulfilled, “The one who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_18.htm">John 13:18</a>)<p>None of them is lost except the son of perdition, so that the Scripture may be fulfilled. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_12.htm">John 17:12</a>)<p>... so that the word that he said would be fulfilled: “Of those whom you gave me I have lost none.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_18_9.htm">John 18:9</a>)<p>Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword in its place. How then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen in this way? All this was done so that the Scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_54.htm">54</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_56.htm">56</a>)<p>The Son of Humanity is going, as it has been written of him, so that the Scriptures will be fulfilled. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_21.htm">Mark 14:21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_49.htm">49</a>)<p>In this way the Scripture was fulfilled that said, “He was numbered with the transgressors.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_15_28.htm">Mark 15:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_37.htm">Luke 22:37</a>)<p>... so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, “They divided my garments among them, and for my tunic they cast lots.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_19_24.htm">John 19:24</a>)<p>After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, so that the Scriptures would be fulfilled... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_19_28.htm">John 19:28</a>)<p>When Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, “It is finished, ” [that is, fulfilled]. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_19_30.htm">John 19:30</a>)<p>These things were done so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, “Not one of his bones will be broken.” And again, another Scripture says, “They will look on the one whom they pierced.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_19_36.htm">John 19:36-37</a>)<p>There are also other places where passages from the prophets are cited and it does not also say that the law or the Scripture has been fulfilled.<p>As for the whole Word having been written about him and his having come into the world to fulfill it, this is what he taught the disciples before he departed:<p>Jesus said to the disciples, “You are foolish, and you are slow of heart to believe everything the prophets said. Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer this and enter into his glory?” Then beginning from Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning about himself. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_25.htm">Luke 24:25-27</a>)<p>Further,<p>Jesus said to the disciples, “These are the words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled that were written in the Law of Moses and the prophets and the Psalms concerning me.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_44.htm">Luke 24:44-45</a>)<p>From these words of the Lord we can see that in the world he fulfilled all of the Word down to the smallest details:<p>Truly, I tell you-until heaven and earth pass away, not one little letter or the tip of one letter will pass from the law until all of it is fulfilled. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>)<p>From this we can now see clearly that to say that the Lord fulfilled all things of the law does not mean that he fulfilled all of the Ten Commandments but that he fulfilled all things of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 11</h4><p>11. That the Lord’s fulfilling all of the Law means that He fulfilled the whole of the Word, is apparent from passages which say that He fulfilled the Scripture, and that all was accomplished. As for example, the following:<p>(Jesus) went into the synagogue...and stood up to read. Then He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when He had opened the book, He found the place where it was written: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the contrite of heart, to preach freedom to captives and sight to the blind..., to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.” After closing the book..., He said..., “Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_4_16.htm">Luke 4:16-21</a>)<p>You search the Scriptures...; and these...testify of Me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_39.htm">John 5:39</a>)<p>...that the Scripture may be fulfilled, “He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_18.htm">John 13:18</a>)<p>...none of them has perished except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_12.htm">John 17:12</a>)<p>...that the word might be fulfilled which He spoke, “Of those whom You gave Me I have lost not one.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_18_9.htm">John 18:9</a>)<p>...Jesus said to (Peter), “Put away your sword in its place.... How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?” ...All this was done that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_54.htm">54</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_56.htm">56</a>)<p>The Son of man...goes away as it is written of Him..., that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.

(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_19_28.htm">John 19:28</a>)<p>...when He had received the vinegar, Jesus said, “It is finished (that is, fulfilled)!” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_19_30.htm">John 19:30</a>)<p>...these things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled, “His bones were not broken.” And again another Scripture says, “They shall look on Him whom they pierced.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_19_36.htm">John 19:36-37</a>)<p>And so on elsewhere where passages in the Prophets are cited and they do not say at the same time that the Law or Scripture had been fulfilled.</p><p>[2] That everything in the Word was written about the Lord, and that He came into the world to fulfill it, is also something He told His disciples before He went away, with these words:<p>(Jesus said to His disciples,) “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His glory?” Moreover, beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_25.htm">Luke 24:25-27</a>)<p>Furthermore:<p>(Jesus said to His disciples,) “These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_44.htm">Luke 24:44-45</a>)<p>That the Lord in the world fulfilled the whole of the Word, even to its least particulars, is apparent from these words of His:<p>...assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will not pass from the Law till all is fulfilled. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>)<p>From this it can now be clearly seen that the Lord’s fulfilling all of the Law does not mean that He fulfilled every one of the commandments in the Decalogue, but that He fulfilled the whole of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Dick translation 1954) 11</h4><p>11. By the Lord's fulfilling all things of the Law is meant that He fulfilled all things of the Word. This is evident from the passages where it is said that the Scripture was fulfilled by Him, and that all things were finished; as from the following passages: <p>Jesus went into the Synagogue ... and stood up to read. And there was delivered unto Him the Book of the Prophet Esaias; and He opened the Book, and found the place where it was written, The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; He hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and sight to the blind ... To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. Then He closed the Book ... and said, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_4_16.htm">Luke 4:16-21</a>. <p>Search, the Scriptures and they testify of me. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_39.htm">John 5:39</a>. <p>That the Scripture might be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_18.htm">John 13:18</a>. <p>None of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_12.htm">John 17:12</a>. <p>That the saying might be fulfilled which He spake, Of those whom thou gavest me have I lost none. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_18_9.htm">John 18:9</a>. <p>Jesus said to Peter, Put up again thy sword into his place... <p>How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?

Before He departed the Lord also taught His disciples that the whole of the Word was written concerning Him, and that He came into the world to fulfil it. This is evident from these words: <p>Addressing the disciples Jesus said, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all things that the Prophets have spoken!

This is evident from His own words: <p>Verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the Law, till all be fulfilled. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>. <p>From these passages it may now be clearly seen, that by the Lord's fulfilling all things of the Law, is not meant that He fulfilled all the commandments of the Decalogue, but that He fulfilled all things of the Word. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Potts translation 1904) 11</h4><p>11. That the statement that the Lord fulfilled all things of the Law means that He fulfilled all things of the Word, is evident from passages where it is said that the Scripture was fulfilled by Him, and that all things were consummated: as from the following: <p>Jesus went into the synagogue, and stood up to read, and there was delivered to Him the book of the prophet Isaiah, and He unrolled the book, and found the place where it is written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me, He hath sent Me to preach the gospel to the poor, to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
