<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">二、主成全了律法的一切是指祂成全或应验了圣言的一切</h4><p>L8.如今许多人以为，当经上论到主说，祂成全了律法时，意思是说，祂成全了十诫的一切诫命，从而成为公义，也因此使这个世界的人因信而称义。然而，这不是它的意思；相反，意思是，主成全了律法和先知书，也就是整部圣经指着祂自己所写的一切；因为圣经唯独论述主，如前一章所述。许多人之所以持有这种不同信仰，是因为他们没有查考圣经，不明白圣经中的“律法”是什么意思。圣经中的律法的意思如下：从狭义上说，是指十诫；从广泛意义上说，是指摩西五经中所写的一切；从最广泛的意义上说，是指圣言的一切。狭义上的律法是指十诫，这是众所周知的。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 8</h4><p>8. To Say That the Lord Fulfilled All of the Law Is to Say That He Fulfilled All of the Word.<p>MANY people nowadays believe that when it says of the Lord that he fulfilled the law [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_5_17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>] it means that he fulfilled all of the Ten Commandments and that by doing so he became justice and justified people in the world by this act of faith.<p>That is not what it means, though. It means rather that he fulfilled everything that was written about him in the Law and the Prophets-that is, in the whole Sacred Scripture - because those writings, as stated under the preceding heading, are about him alone. The reason so many people believe something else is that they have not studied the Scriptures and seen what “the law” means in them.<p>In a strict sense “the law” does mean the Ten Commandments. In a broader sense it means everything Moses wrote in his five books; and in the broadest sense it means the whole Word.<p>It is common knowledge that in a strict sense “the law” does mean the Ten Commandments. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 8</h4><p>8. The Statement That the Lord Fulfilled All of the Law Means That He Fulfilled All of the Word<p>Many people today believe that, when it is said of the Lord that He fulfilled the Law, it means that He fulfilled all the commandments of the Decalogue, and that in so doing He became righteousness and at the same time justified people in the world by that belief.<p>Nevertheless, that is not the meaning. Rather the meaning is that He fulfilled everything written about Him in the Law and the Prophets, that is, throughout Holy Scripture, because it has Him alone as its subject, as we said in the previous section.<p>The reason many people have believed otherwise is that they have not searched the scriptures and seen what is meant by the Law there.<p>In a strict sense the Law there means the ten commandments of the Decalogue. In a broader sense it means everything written by Moses in his five books. And in the broadest sense it means the whole of the Word.<p>That the Law in a strict sense means the Ten Commandments of the Decalogue is something people know. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Dick translation 1954) 8</h4><p>8. II. BY THE LORD'S FULFILLING ALL THINGS OF THE LAW IS MEANT, THAT HE FULFILLED ALL THINGS OF THE WORD. <p>It is believed by many at this day that when it is said of the Lord that He fulfilled the Law, the meaning is, that He fulfilled all the commandments of the Decalogue, and thus became Righteousness; and that He also justified men in the world through faith in this achievement. Nevertheless, this is not what is meant; but the meaning is that He fulfilled all the things that are written concerning Him in the Law and the Prophets, that is, in the whole Sacred Scripture; because this treats of Him alone, as was said in the previous chapter. The reason why many have entertained a different belief is, because they have not searched the Scripture and seen what is there meant by the Law. By the Law are there meant, <p>1. In a restricted sense, the Ten Commandments of the Decalogue; <p>2. In a wider sense, all things that were written by Moses in his five Books; <p>3. And in the widest sense, all things of the Word. <p>1. BY THE LAW, IN A RESTRICTED SENSE, ARE MEANT THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF THE DECALOGUE. This is generally known. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Potts translation 1904) 8</h4><p>8. ITS BEING SAID THAT THE LORD FULFILLED ALL THINGS OF THE LAW, MEANS THAT HE FULFILLED ALL THINGS OF THE WORD. <p>At the present day many persons believe that when it is said of the Lord that He fulfilled the law, the meaning is that He fulfilled all the commandments of the Decalogue, and thus became righteousness, and also justified the men of this world through this matter of faith. This however is not the meaning. The meaning is that the Lord fulfilled all things written concerning Himself in the Law and the Prophets, that is, in universal Holy Scripture, because this treats solely of Him, as has been said in the foregoing article. The reason why many have believed differently, is that they have not searched the Scriptures and seen what is there meant by "the Law." The Law there means, in a restricted sense, the ten commandments of the Decalogue; in a wider sense, all things written by Moses in the five books; and in the widest sense, all things of the Word. It is well known that By the Law in a restricted sense are meant the ten commandments of the Decalogue. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 8 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>8. (II.) QUOD DOMINUS IMPLEVERIT OMNIA LEGIS, SIT QUOD IMPLEVERIT OMNIA VERBI. <p>Creditur a multis hodie, quod ubi dicitur de Domino quod impleverit Legem, intelligatur quod impleverit omnia praecepta decalogi, et quod sic Justitia factus sit, ac justificaverit homines mundi etiam per illud fidei. Attamen non intelligitur illud, sed quod impleverit omnia quae de Ipso scripta sunt in Lege et Prophetis, hoc est, in universa Scriptura Sacra, quia haec de solo Ipso agit, ut in superiore articulo dictum est. Quod multi aliter crediderint, est causa, quia non scrutati sunt Scripturas, et viderunt quid per "Legem" ibi intelligitur. Per "Legem" ibi intelliguntur, <p>(i.) In stricto sensu decem praecepta decalogi; <p>(ii.) In latiori sensu omnia quae a Mose in quinque ejus libris scripta sunt; <p>(iii.) Et in latissimo sensu omnia Verbi<p>(i.) Quod per "Legem" in stricto sensu intelligantur decem praecepta decalogi, notum est. </p>
