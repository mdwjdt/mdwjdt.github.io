<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》 第63节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>L63.“圣城新耶路撒冷”表示教义方面的这个新教会。因此，它被看到由神那里从天而降，因为纯正真理的教义只从主那里经由天堂而来。由于城，就是新耶路撒冷，表示教义方面的教会，所以经上说：</p><p>就如新妇妆饰整齐，等候丈夫。（启示录21:2）</p><p>后来又说：</p><p>七位天使中有一位来同我说话，说，你来，我要将新妇，就是羔羊的妻，指示你。我在灵里被那天使带到一座又大又高的山上，他将那大城，就是由神那里从天而降的圣耶路撒冷指示我。（启示录21:9，10）</p><p>众所周知，当主由“新郎”和“丈夫”来表示时，教会就由“新妇”和“妻子”来表示。当教会愿意接受主时，她就是一个“新妇”；当她接受主时，则是一个“妻子”。显然，“她的丈夫”表示主；因为经上说“新妇就是羔羊的妻”。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 63</h4><p>63. The holy city Jerusalem means that new church in regard to its teachings. That is why it was seen coming down from God out of heaven, because the only source of genuinely true teaching is through heaven from the Lord.<p>It is because the city New Jerusalem means the church in regard to its teachings that it says “prepared as a bride adorned for her husband” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>) and then,<p>One of the seven angels came to me and talked with me, saying, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.” And he carried me away in the spirit to a high mountain, and showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_9.htm">Revelation 21:9-10</a>)<p>It is common knowledge that the bride and wife mean the church and the Bridegroom and Husband mean the Lord. The church is the bride when it is willing to receive the Lord and is the wife when it does receive him. We can see that the Husband means the Lord in this passage because it says “the bride, the wife of the Lamb.” </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 63</h4><p>63. The Holy City, New Jerusalem, means that new church in respect to its doctrine. That is why it was seen descending out of heaven from God, for a doctrine of genuine truth comes from no other source than the Lord through heaven.<p>Because the church in respect to its doctrine is meant by the Holy City, New Jerusalem, therefore it is said to be prepared as a bride, adorned for her husband (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>), and after that we are told:<p>One of the seven angels...came to me and spoke with me, saying, “Come, I will show you the bride, the Lamb’s wife.” And he carried me away in the spirit onto a...high mountain, and showed me the great city, the Holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_9.htm">Revelation 21:9-10</a>)<p>People know that a bride and a wife mean the church when the Lord is meant by the bridegroom and husband. The church is a bride when it wishes to receive the Lord, but a wife when it does receive Him.<p>It is apparent that the Lord is meant by the husband there, for the bride is called the Lamb’s wife. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Dick translation 1954) 63</h4><p>63. By the holy city, [New] Jerusalem, is meant this new Church as to doctrine. It was therefore seen coming down from God out of heaven, for the doctrine of genuine truth comes only from the Lord through heaven. Because the Church as to doctrine is meant by the city, New Jerusalem, it is therefore said: <p>Prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>; and afterwards: <p>There came unto me one of the seven angels ... and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife. <p>And he carried me away in the spirit to a ... high mountain, and showed me that great city, the Holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_9.htm">Revelation 21:9-10</a>. <p>It is well known that by the bride and wife are meant the Church when the Lord is meant by the Bridegroom and Husband. The Church is a bride when she is willing to receive the Lord, and a wife, when she has received Him. It is evident that the Lord is here meant by the husband; for it is said, the bride, the Lamb's wife. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Potts translation 1904) 63</h4><p>63. By the "Holy City Jerusalem" is meant this New Church as to doctrine, and therefore it was seen coming down from God out of heaven, for the doctrine of genuine truth comes to us from the Lord through heaven, and from no other source. As the Church in respect to doctrine is meant by the City New Jerusalem, it is said: <p>Prepared as a bride adorned for her Husband (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>); <p>and afterwards, <p>There came unto me one of the seven angels, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the Holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_9.htm">Revelation 21:9-10</a>). <p>That by "bride" and "wife" is meant the church, when the Lord is meant by "bridegroom" and "husband," is well known. The church is a "bride" when she is desirous to receive the Lord; and a "wife," when she does receive Him. That the Lord is meant by "her Husband" is evident; for it is said, "the bride the Lamb's wife." </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 63 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>63. Per "civitatem sanctam Hierosolymam" intelligitur nova illa ecclesia quoad doctrinam; quare illa visa a Deo e caelo descendens, nam doctrina genuini veri non aliunde venit quam per caelum a Domino. Quia ecclesia quoad doctrinam per "civitatem Novam Hierosolymam" intelligitur, ideo dicitur, <p>"Parata sicut Sponsa ornata Marito suo" (vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_63/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_2">2</a>): <p>Et postea, <p>"Venit ad me unus de septem angelis,... et locutus mecum, dicens, Veni, ostendam tibi Sponsam Agni Uxorem: et abstulit me in spiritu super montem... altum, et ostendit mihi civitatem magnam, sanctam Hierosolymam, descendentem e caelo a Deo" (vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_63/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_revelation_21_9-10">9-10</a>, in eodem capite). <p>Quod per "Sponsam" et "Uxorem" intelligatur ecclesia, cum per "Dominum" Sponsus et Maritus, <sup>1</sup>notum est. Ecclesia Sponsa est quando vult Dominum recipere, at Uxor quando recepit. Quod Dominus per "Maritum" ibi intelligatur, patet; nam dicitur, "Sponsa Agni Uxor."<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><p>1.&nbsp;"per Dominum Sponsus et Maritus:"--sic editio princeps. Forte est legendum:--per "Sponsum" et "Maritum" intelligitur Dominus." </p>
