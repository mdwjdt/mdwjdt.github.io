<h4 align="center"></h4><p>L44.人若知道大卫表示主，就能知道为何大卫在他的诗篇中写到他自己时，如此频繁地描写主；如这些话：</p><p>我与我所拣选的人立了约，向我的仆人大卫起了誓；我要建立你的种，直到永远；要建立你的宝座，直到代代；诸天要称赞你的奇事，在圣者的会中，要称赞你的信实。当时，你在异象中晓谕你的圣民说，我已把救助加在那有能的一位身上，我高举那从民中所拣选的。我寻得我的仆人大卫，用我的圣膏膏祂。我的手必使祂坚立，我的膀臂也必使祂强壮。只是我的信实和我的怜悯要与祂同在，因我的名，祂的角必被高举。我要使祂的手伸到海上，右手伸到河上。祂必向我呼叫，你是我的父，我的神，是拯救我的磐石。我也要立祂为我的长子，高过世上的列王。我与他立的约必要坚定。我也要使祂的种存到永远，使祂的宝座如天之日子。我一次指着自己的圣洁起誓，我决不向大卫说谎。祂的种要存到永远，祂的宝座在我面前如太阳。又如月亮永远坚立，如云中信实的见证。（诗篇89:3-5，19-21，24-29，35-37；45:1-17；122:4，5；132:8-18）</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 44</h4><p>44. Once people realize that “David” means the Lord, they can know why David so often wrote about the Lord in his psalms when he was writing about himself. See <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_1.htm">Psalm 89</a>, for example, where we find,<p>I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to David my servant, “I will establish your seed even to eternity and build your throne for generation after generation. And the heavens will bear witness to your wondrous work, and to [your] truth, in the congregation of the saints.” Then you spoke to your holy one in a vision and said, “I have put [ability to] help in a mighty one; I have raised up a chosen one from among the people. I have found David, my servant; I have anointed him with my holy oil. With him my hand will be strong; my arm will strengthen him also. My truth and my mercy will be with him, and his horn will be exalted in my name. And I will place his hand on the sea and his right hand on the rivers. He will cry out to me, ‘You are my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation.’ I will also make him the firstborn, high above the monarchs of the earth. My covenant will be established with him. I will make his seed endure to eternity and his throne as the days of the heavens. I have sworn once by my holiness; I will not lie to David. His seed will endure forever and his throne will be like the sun before me; it will be as established as the moon to eternity and a faithful witness in the clouds.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_3.htm">Psalms 89:3-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_19.htm">19-21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_24.htm">24-29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_35.htm">35-37</a>)<p>There is similar material in other psalms, such as <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_45_2.htm">Psalm 45:2-17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_122_4.htm">Psalm 122:4-5</a>, and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_132_8.htm">Psalm 132:8-18</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 44</h4><p>44. Someone who knows that the Lord is meant by David can see why David so many times in his Psalms wrote about the Lord when writing about himself, as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_1.htm">Psalms 89</a>, where we find the following:<p>I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn to My servant David: “Your seed I will firmly establish even to eternity, and build up your throne to all generations....”<p>And the heavens will praise Your wonders..., Your truth also in the assembly of the saints....<p>Then You spoke in a vision to Your holy one, and said: “I have given help to one who is mighty; I have exalted one chosen from the people. I have found My servant David; with My holy oil I have anointed him, with whom My hand shall be firm; Also My arm shall strengthen him....<p>“My truth and My mercy shall be with him, and in My name his horn shall be exalted. Also I will set his hand on the sea, and his right hand on the rivers. He shall call to Me, ‘You are my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.’ Also I will make him My firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.... My covenant shall stand firm with him. His seed also I will make to endure to eternity, and his throne as the days of heaven....<p>“Once have I sworn by My holiness, I will not lie to David. His seed shall endure forever, and His throne as the sun before Me; like the moon it shall remain fixed to eternity, and be a faithful witness in the clouds.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_3.htm">Psalms 89:3-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_19.htm">19-21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_24.htm">24-29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_35.htm">35-37</a>)<p>And the like also in other Psalms, as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_45_1.htm">Psalms 45:1-17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_122_4.htm">122:4-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_132_8.htm">132:8-18</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Dick translation 1954) 44</h4><p>44. He who knows that by David is meant the Lord is able to comprehend why David in the Psalms so often wrote concerning the Lord, when he spoke only of himself; as in Psalm 89, where these words occur: <p>I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, <p>Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. <p>And the heavens shall praise thy wonders ... thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints ... Then thou spakest in vision to thy Holy One, and saidst, I have laid help upon One that is mighty; I have exalted One chosen out of the people. <p>I have found David my servant; with my Holy oil have I anointed Him: <p>With whom my hand shall be established; mine arm also shall strengthen Him ... <p>My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with Him and in my name shall His horn be exalted. <p>I will set His hand also in the sea, and His right hand in the rivers. <p>He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation. <p>Also I will make Him my First-born, higher than the kings of the earth. <p>My covenant shall stand fast with Him. <p>His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and His throne as the days of the heavens. <p>Once have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lie unto David. <p>His seed shall endure for ever, and His throne as the sun before me. <p>It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in the clouds. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_3.htm">Psalm 89:3-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_19.htm">19-21</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_24.htm">24-29</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_89_35.htm">35-37</a>. <p>So also in other Psalms, as ; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_122_4.htm">Psalm 122:4-5</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_132_8.htm">132:8-18</a>. </p>
