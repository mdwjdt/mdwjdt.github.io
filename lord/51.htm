<h4 align="center"></h4><p>L51.⑸当论及主时，“灵”尤表祂智慧的生命，也就是神性真理。约翰福音：</p><p>我将真情告诉你们，我去是与你们有益的。我若不去，保惠师就不到你们这里来；我若去，就差祂到你们这里来。（约翰福音16:7）</p><p></p><p>只等祂，就是真理的圣灵来了，祂要引导你们进入一切的真理。祂不是凭自己说的，乃是把祂所听见的都说出来。（约翰福音16:13）</p><p></p><p>祂要荣耀我，因为祂必从我领受，将它传告你们。凡父所有的，都是我的，所以我说，祂要从我领受，将它传告你们。（约翰福音16:14，15）</p><p></p><p>我要求父，父就另外赐给你们一位保惠师，就是真理的灵，乃世人不能接受的，因为不见祂，也不认识祂；你们却认识祂，因祂与你们同住，也要在你们里面。我不撇下你们为孤儿，我必到你们这里来，你们却看见我。（约翰福音14:16-19）</p><p></p><p>我要从父那里给你们差保惠师来，就是真理的灵，祂就要为我作见证。（约翰福音15:26）</p><p></p><p>耶稣喊着说，人若渴了，可以到我这里来喝！信我的人，就如经上所说：从他腹中要流出活水的江河来。耶稣这话是指着信他之人要受的灵说的。那时还没有赐下圣灵来，因为耶稣尚未得着荣耀。（约翰福音7:37-39）</p><p></p><p>耶稣就向祂的门徒吹一口气，说，你们受圣灵。（约翰福音20:22）</p><p>主以“保惠师”、“真理的灵”和“圣灵”表示祂自己，这一点从主的话明显看出来：世人还不认识祂；因为他们还不认识主。此外，当祂说，祂要差圣灵来时，补充说：</p><p>我不会撇下你们为孤儿，我必到你们这里来，你们却看见我。（约翰福音14:16-19，26，28）</p><p>在</p><p>看哪，我常与你们同在，直到时代的完结。（马太福音28:20）</p><p>当多马说，我们不知道你往哪里去时，耶稣说，我就是道路、真理（约翰福音14:5，6）。</p><p>由于真理的灵或圣灵，与作为真理本身的主是一样的，故经上还说：</p><p>还没有赐下圣灵来，因为耶稣尚未得着荣耀。（约翰福音7:39）</p><p>因为主通过十字架受难得了荣耀，或与父完全合一后，就是神性智慧和神性真理本身，因而是圣灵。主之所以向门徒吹气说，你们受圣灵，是因为天堂的一切呼吸皆来自主。事实上，天使跟世人一样，也有呼吸和心跳；他们的呼吸取决于他们对来自主的智慧的接受；他们的心跳或脉搏取决于他们对来自主的神性之爱的接受。事实就是如此，这一点可见于适当地方。</p><p>“圣灵”是指来自主的神性真理，这一点从下列经文进一步明显看出来，路加福音：</p><p>人带你们到会堂，不要思虑说什么话，因为正在那时刻，圣灵要指教你们当说的话。（路加福音12:11，12；21:14；马可福音13:11）</p><p>以赛亚书：</p><p>耶和华说，我加给你的灵，放在你口中的话，必不离你的口。（以赛亚书59:21）</p><p></p><p>从耶西的茎必发出一根枝条来。祂要以口中的杖击打地，以嘴里的气杀戮恶人，真理必当祂的腰带。（以赛亚书11:1，4，5）</p><p></p><p>祂已用口吩咐，祂的灵将它们聚集。（以赛亚书34:16）</p><p>约翰福音：</p><p>敬拜神的，必须以灵和真理来敬拜。（约翰福音4:24）</p><p></p><p>叫人活着的乃是灵，肉体是无益的。我对你们所说的话就是灵，就是生命。（约翰福音6:63）</p><p>马太福音：</p><p>约翰说，我是用水给你们施洗，叫你们悔改；但那在我以后来的，祂要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。（马太福音3:11；马可福音1:8；路加福音3:16）</p><p>“用圣灵与火给施洗”是指通过与信有关的神性真理和与爱有关的神性良善重生。当耶稣受洗时，天开了，祂看见圣灵好像鸽子降下（马太福音3:16；马可福音1:10；路加福音3:21，22；约翰福音1:32，33）。鸽子是通过神性真理洁净和重生的一个代表。</p><p>由于在论述主的地方，“圣灵”表示祂的神性生命，因而表示祂自己；尤表祂智慧的生命，这生命被称为神性真理，所以也被称为圣灵的众先知的“灵”，表示来自主的神性真理。如在下列经文中，启示录：</p><p>灵对众教会说。（启示录2:7，11，29；3:1，6，13，22）</p><p></p><p>在宝座前点着的七盏火灯就是神的七灵。（启示录4:5）</p><p></p><p>在众长老中间，有羔羊站立，有七眼，就是神的七灵，奉差遣往全地去的。（启示录5:6）</p><p>“火灯”和主的“眼”表示神性真理，“七”表示神圣之物。启示录：</p><p>灵说，他们息了自己的劳苦。（启示录14:13）</p><p></p><p>灵和新妇都说，来！（启示录22:17）</p><p>撒迦利亚书：</p><p>他们使他们的心坚硬，不听律法，或耶和华用祂的灵借先知的手所传达的话。（撒迦利亚书7:12）</p><p>列王纪下：</p><p>以利亚的灵临到以利沙身上了。（列王纪下2:15）</p><p>路加福音：</p><p>约翰以利亚的灵和能力，行在前面。（路加福音1:17）</p><p></p><p>以利沙伯被圣灵充满，就预言说。（路加福音1:41）</p><p></p><p>撒迦利亚被圣灵充满了，就预言说。（路加福音1:67）</p><p>马可福音：</p><p>大卫在圣灵里说，主对我主说，你坐在我的右手边。（马可福音12:36）</p><p>启示录：</p><p>预言中的灵意乃是为耶稣作见证。（启示录19:10）</p><p>由于“圣灵”尤表神性智慧，因而神性真理方方面的主，故显而易见为何经上论到圣灵说，它光照、教导和启发。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 51</h4><p>51. 5. When “spirit” is used in speaking of the Lord, it means specifically the life his wisdom gives us, which is divine truth.<p>I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away. If I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go away, I will send him to you. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_7.htm">John 16:7</a>)<p>When he, the Spirit of Truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own authority, but will say whatever he has heard. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_13.htm">John 16:13</a>)<p>He will glorify me, because he will take of what is mine and declare it to you. All things that the Father has are mine. That is why I said that he will take of what is mine and declare it to you. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_14.htm">John 16:14-15</a>)<p>I will ask the Father to give you another Comforter, the Spirit of Truth. The world cannot receive him, because it does not see him or know him; but you know him, because he dwells among you and will be in you. I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you. You will see me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_19.htm">19</a>)<p>When the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of Truth, he will testify concerning me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>)<p>Jesus cried out, saying, “If any are thirsty, they must come to me and drink. As the Scripture says, from the bellies of those who believe in me will flow rivers of living water.” He said this concerning the Spirit that those who believed in him would receive. There was not the Holy Spirit yet because Jesus was not yet glorified. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_7_37.htm">John 7:37-39</a>)<p>Jesus breathed on the disciples and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_22.htm">John 20:22</a>)</p><p>[2] We can see that the Lord meant himself by the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, and the Holy Spirit from these words of the Lord, that the world did not yet know him-that is, they did not yet know the Lord. Further, when he said that he would send him, he added,<p>I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you, and you will see me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_16.htm">John 14:16-19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_26.htm">26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_28.htm">28</a>)<p>And in another passage,<p>Behold, I am with you all the days, even to the close of the age. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>)<p>And when Thomas said, “We do not know where you are going, ” Jesus said, “I am the way and the truth” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_5.htm">John 14:5-6</a>).</p><p>[3] Because the Spirit of Truth or the Holy Spirit is the same as the Lord, who is the truth itself, it also says “There was not the Holy Spirit yet because Jesus was not yet glorified” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_7_39.htm">John 7:39</a>). This is because after his glorification or full union with the Father, which was accomplished by his suffering on the cross, the Lord was then divine wisdom itself and divine truth-therefore the Holy Spirit.<p>The reason the Lord breathed on the disciples and said “Receive the Holy Spirit” was that all of heaven’s breathing originates with the Lord. Angels breathe just as we do, and their hearts beat. Their breathing depends on their acceptance of divine wisdom from the Lord and their heartbeat or pulse depends on their acceptance of divine love from the Lord. This will be explained in its proper place.</p><p>[4] From the following passages we can clearly see that the Holy Spirit is divine truth that comes from the Lord:<p>When they hand you over to the synagogues, do not worry about what you are going to say. The Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you should say. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_12_11.htm">Luke 12:11-12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_14.htm">21:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_11.htm">Mark 13:11</a>)<p>Jehovah said, “My spirit, which is upon you, and my words, which I have placed in your mouth, shall not depart from your mouth.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_59_21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>)<p>A shoot will go forth from the trunk of Jesse. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the spirit of his lips he will slay the ungodly. Truth will be a belt around his hips. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_4.htm">4-5</a>)<p>Now he has commanded with his mouth and his spirit has gathered them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_34_16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>)<p>Those who worship God must worship in spirit and in truth. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_24.htm">John 4:24</a>)<p>It is the spirit that gives life-the flesh is of no benefit. The words that I speak to you are spirit and are life. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>)<p>John said, “I am baptizing you with water into repentance, but the one who is to come after me will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_3_11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_8.htm">Mark 1:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_3_16.htm">Luke 3:16</a>)<p>To baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire is to regenerate by means of the divine truth that produces faith and the divine goodness that produces love [within us].<p>When Jesus was being baptized, the heavens were opened and he saw the Holy Spirit coming down like a dove. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_3_16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_10.htm">Mark 1:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_3_21.htm">Luke 3:21</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_32.htm">John 1:32-33</a>)<p>A dove represents purification and regeneration by means of divine truth.</p><p>[5] When “the Holy Spirit” is used in speaking of the Lord it means his divine life and therefore himself, and specifically it means the life his wisdom gives us, which is called divine truth; therefore the spirit of the prophets, which is also called the Holy Spirit, means divine truth that comes from the Lord. This is the case in the following passages:<p>... what the Spirit says to the churches. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_11.htm">11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_29.htm">29</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_1.htm">3:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_6.htm">6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_3_22.htm">22</a>)<p>The seven lamps of fire burning before the throne are the seven spirits of God. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_4_5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a>)<p>In the midst of the elders stood a Lamb, having seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>)<p>The lamps of fire and the eyes of the Lord mean divine truths, and seven means what is holy.<p>... says the Spirit, “so that they may rest from their labors.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_14_13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>)<p>The Spirit and the bride say, “Come.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_17.htm">Revelation 22:17</a>)<p>They made their hearts diamond-hard so that they would not hear the law or the words that Jehovah sent by his spirit through the hand of the prophets. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_7_12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a>)<p>The spirit of Elijah came upon Elisha. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/2-kings_2_15.htm">2 Kings 2:15</a>)<p>John went before [the Lord] in the spirit and power of Elijah. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>)<p>Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_41.htm">Luke 1:41</a>)<p>Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_1_67.htm">Luke 1:67</a>)<p>David said by the Holy Spirit, “The Lord said to my Lord, ‘Sit at my right hand.’” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_12_36.htm">Mark 12:36</a>)<p>The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_19_10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>)<p>Since, then, the Holy Spirit means specifically the Lord’s divine wisdom and therefore his divine truth, we can see why it is that people say of the Holy Spirit that it enlightens, teaches, and inspires. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 51</h4><p>51. Whenever the term spirit is applied to the Lord, it means in particular the life of His wisdom, which is Divine truth:<p>...I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go away, I will send Him to you. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_7.htm">John 16:7</a>)<p>...when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; ...He will not speak on His own, but whatever He hears He will speak. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_13.htm">John 16:13</a>)<p>He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you. All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will take of Mine and declare it to you. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_14.htm">John 16:14-15</a>)<p>I will ask the Father to give you another Counselor..., the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you. I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you.... ...you will see Me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_16.htm">John 14:16-19</a>, cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_26.htm">14:26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_28.htm">28</a>)<p>...when the Counselor comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth..., He will testify of Me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_26.htm">John 15:26</a>)<p>...Jesus...cried out, saying, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. Whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his belly will flow rivers of living water.” This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive; ...the Holy Spirit did not yet exist, because Jesus was not yet glorified. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_7_37.htm">John 7:37-39</a>)<p>(Jesus) breathed on (His disciples) and said..., “Receive the Holy Spirit.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_20_22.htm">John 20:22</a>)</p><p>[2] By the Counselor, the Spirit of truth, and the Holy Spirit, the Lord meant Himself, and this is apparent from the Lord’s saying that the world did not yet know the Counselor or Spirit of truth; for people did not as yet know the Lord. Moreover, when He said that He would send Him, He added, “I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you, “ and “you will see Me” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_16.htm">John 14:16-19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_26.htm">26</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_28.htm">28</a>). At another time, too, He said, “Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). And when Thomas said, “We do not know where You are going, ” Jesus said, “I am the way and the truth” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_5.htm">John 14:5-6</a>).</p><p>[3] Because the Spirit of truth, or Holy Spirit, is the same as the Lord, who is truth itself, therefore we are also told, “The Holy Spirit did not yet exist, because Jesus was not yet glorified” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_7_39.htm">John 7:39</a>). For after the Lord’s glorification or complete union with the Father, which was achieved by His suffering of the cross, the Lord was then Divine wisdom itself and Divine truth itself, thus the Holy Spirit.<p>The Lord breathed on His disciples and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit, ” because respiration in heaven is dependent wholly on the Lord. For angels breathe and their hearts beat just as in the case of people. Their respiration accords with their reception of Divine wisdom from the Lord, and the beating of their hearts or pulse accords with their reception of Divine love from the Lord. The reality of this will be seen in its own place.</p><p>[4] That the Holy Spirit is Divine truth received from the Lord is still more apparent from the following passages:<p>When they deliver you to the synagogues..., do not worry about...what you will say. ...the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you should say. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_12_11.htm">Luke 12:11-12</a>, cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_21_14.htm">21:14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_11.htm">Mark 13:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_13_12.htm">12</a>)<p>...said Jehovah, “...My Spirit which is upon you, and My words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart from your mouth....” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_59_21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>)<p>There shall come forth a Rod from the stem of Jesse.... He shall strike the earth with the rod of His mouth, and with the spirit [i.e., breath ] of His lips He shall slay the impious. Truth shall be the girdle of His loins....

(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_4_24.htm">John 4:24</a>)<p>It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit and...life. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_63.htm">John 6:63</a>)<p>(John said,) “I...baptize you with water for repentance, but He who is coming after me...will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_3_11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>, cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_8.htm">Mark 1:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_3_16.htm">Luke 3:16</a>)<p>To baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire means to regenerate by means of the Divine truth that is a property of faith and the Divine goodness that is a property of love.<p>When (Jesus) was baptized..., the heavens were opened..., and He saw the (Holy) Spirit...descending like a dove....
