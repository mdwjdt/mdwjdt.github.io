<h4 align="center"></h4><p>L54.由此明显可知，耶和华，就是永恒之主，通过众先知说话；凡提到圣灵的地方，它都是指主自己；由此可推知：神在位格和本质上都是一，这神就是主。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 54</h4><p>54. We can now see from this that Jehovah, who is the Lord from eternity, spoke through the prophets and that where it speaks of the Holy Spirit, it is he himself.<p>Therefore, God is one in person and in essence, and he is the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 54</h4><p>54. It is now apparent from this that it was Jehovah, the Lord from eternity, who spoke through the Prophets, and that wherever the Holy Spirit is mentioned, it means the Lord Himself.<p>So we conclude that there is one God in both person and essence, and that that God is the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Dick translation 1954) 54</h4><p>54. From what has been adduced it is now clear that Jehovah, who is the Lord from eternity, spoke by the Prophets; and that where the Holy Spirit is mentioned, it is Himself who is meant; and consequently that God is One, both in Person and in Essence, and that He is the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Potts translation 1904) 54</h4><p>54. From all this then it is evident that JEHOVAH (who is THE LORD FROM ETERNITY) spoke through the prophets; and that where the HOLY SPIRIT is mentioned, it is the Lord Himself. It follows that GOD IS ONE IN BOTH PERSON AND ESSENCE, AND THAT THIS GOD IS THE LORD. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 54 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>54. Ex his nunc patet quod Jehovah, qui est Dominus ab aeterno, locutus sit per Prophetas; et quod, ubi dicitur "Spiritus Sanctus," sit Ipse. Consequenter, Quod Deus sit unus et Persona et Essentia, et quod Ille sit Dominus. </p>
