<h4 align="center"></h4><p>L32.⑶祂出于自己里面的神性使人身变成神性。这一点从圣言的许多经文明显看出来，现从中引用经文证实下列命题：</p><p>①这一点是逐步完成的，路加福音：</p><p>耶稣在灵里和智慧上渐渐长大，强健起来，又有神的恩在祂身上。（路加福音2:40）</p><p></p><p>耶稣在智慧和年纪，以及在得神和人的喜爱上，渐渐地增长。（路加福音2:52）</p><p>②神性通过人身进行运作，就像灵魂通过身体进行运作一样。这一点从以下经文明显看出来，约翰福音：</p><p>子凭着自己不能做什么，惟有看见父所做的，子才能做。（约翰福音5:19）</p><p></p><p>我没有一件事是凭着自己做的。我说这些话，乃是照着父所教训我的。那差我来的，是与我同在；祂没有撇下我独自一人。（约翰福音8:28，29；5:30）</p><p></p><p>我没有凭着自己讲，惟有差我来的父，已经给我命令，叫我说什么，讲什么。（约翰福音12:49）</p><p></p><p>我对你们所说的话，不是凭着自己说的，乃是住在我里面的父做祂的工作。（约翰福音14:10）</p><p></p><p>我不是独自一人，因为有父与我同在。（约翰福音16:32）</p><p>③神性与人身一致运作。这一点从以下经文明显看出来，约翰福音：</p><p>父所做的事，子也照样做。（约翰福音5:19）</p><p></p><p>父怎样叫死人起来，使他们活着，子也照样随自己的意思使人活着。（约翰福音5:21）</p><p></p><p>父怎样在自己有生命，就赐给儿子也照样在自己有生命。（约翰福音5:26）</p><p></p><p>如今他们知道，凡你所赐给我的，都是从你那里来的。（约翰福音17:7）</p><p>④神性与人身合一，人身与神性合一。这一点从以下经文明显看出来，约翰福音：</p><p>你们若认识我，也就认识我的父；并且已经看见祂。祂对想要见父的腓力说，腓力，我与你们同在这样长久，你还不认识我吗？人看见了我，就是看见了父。我在父里面，父在我里面，你不信吗？你们当信我，我在父里面，父在我里面。（约翰福音14:7-11）</p><p></p><p>我若不行我父的事，你们就不必信我；我若行了，也当信这些事；叫你们又知道又明白：父在我里面，我也在父里面。（约翰福音10:37，38）</p><p></p><p>使他们都合而为一。正如你，父在我里面，我在你里面。（约翰福音17:21）</p><p></p><p>到那日你们就知道我在我父里面。（约翰福音14:20）</p><p></p><p>谁也不能从我父手里把羊夺去；我与父为一。（约翰福音10:29，30）</p><p></p><p>父爱子，已将万有交在祂手里。（约翰福音3:35）</p><p></p><p>凡父所有的，都是我的。（约翰福音16:15）</p><p></p><p>凡是我的都是你的，你的也是我的。（约翰福音17:10）</p><p></p><p>正如你曾赐给子权柄，管理凡有血气的。（约翰福音17:2）</p><p>马太福音：</p><p>天上地上所有的权柄，都赐给我了。（马太福音28:18）</p><p>⑤要靠近神性人身。这一点从以下经文明显看出来，约翰福音：</p><p>叫人都尊敬子如同尊敬父一样。（约翰福音5:23）</p><p></p><p>你们若是认识我，也就认识我的父。（约翰福音8:19）</p><p></p><p>人看见我，就是看见那差我来的。（约翰福音12:45）</p><p></p><p>你们若认识我，也就认识我的父。从今以后，你们认识祂，并且已经看见祂。（约翰福音14:7）</p><p></p><p>接待我，就是接待那差遣我的。（约翰福音13:20）</p><p>这是因为，没有人能看见被称为“父”的神性本身；但神性人身是能被看见的；因为主说：</p><p>从来没有人看见神，只有在父怀里的独生子将祂表明出来。（约翰福音1:18）</p><p></p><p>这不是说有人看见过父，惟独与父同在的，祂看见过父。（约翰福音6:46）</p><p></p><p>你们从来没有听见父的嗓音，也没有看见祂的形状。（约翰福音5:37）</p><p>⑥由于主从祂自己里面的神性将祂的人身变成神性，还由于人身要被靠近，是神的儿子，所以我们必须信主，主既是父，也是子。这一点从以下经文明显看出来，约翰福音：</p><p>耶稣说，凡接待祂的，就是信祂名的人，祂就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。（约翰福音1:12）</p><p></p><p>叫一切信祂的，不至灭亡，反得永生。（约翰福音3:15）</p><p></p><p>神爱世人，甚至赐下祂的独生子，叫一切信他的，都得永生。（约翰福音3:16）</p><p></p><p>信子的人，不受审判；不信的人，已受了审判，因为祂不信神独生子的名。（约翰福音3:18）</p><p></p><p>信子的人有永生；不信子的人不得见永生，神的震怒常在他身上。（约翰福音3:36）</p><p></p><p>神的粮，就是那从天上降下来赐生命给世界的。到我这里来的，必定不饿；信我的，永远不渴。（约翰福音6:33，35）</p><p></p><p>这是差我来者的意思，凡见子而信的人都有永生；在末日我要叫他复活。（约翰福音6:40）</p><p></p><p>他们对对耶稣说，我们当行什么，才算做神的工呢？耶稣回答，信神所差来的，这就是神的工。（约翰福音6:28，29）</p><p></p><p>我实实在在地告诉你们：信我的人有永生。（约翰福音6:47）</p><p></p><p>耶稣喊着说，人若渴了，可以到我这里来喝！信我的人，就如经上所说，从他腹中要流出活水的江河来。（约翰福音7:37，38）</p><p></p><p>你们若不信我永在，必要死在罪中。（约翰福音8:24）</p><p></p><p>耶稣说，我就是复活和生命；信我的人，虽然死了，也必活着。凡活着信我的人必永远不死。（约翰福音11:25，26）</p><p></p><p>耶稣说，我到世上来，乃是光，叫凡信我的，不住在黑暗里。（约翰福音12:46；8:12）</p><p></p><p>你们应当趁着有光，信从这光，使你们成为光明之子。（约翰福音12:36）</p><p></p><p>我实实在在地告诉你们，死人要听见神儿子的声音，听见的人就要活了。（约翰福音5:25）</p><p></p><p>你们要住在我里面，我也住在你们里面。我是葡萄树，你们是枝子；住在我里面的，我也住在他里面，这人就多结果子。因为离了我，你们就不能做什么。（约翰福音15:4，5）</p><p></p><p>他们在主里面，主也在你们里面。（约翰福音14:20；17:23）</p><p></p><p>我就是道路、真理、生命；若不藉着我，没有人能到父那里去。（约翰福音14:6）</p><p>在这些和其它提到“父”的经文中，“父”是指自成孕时就在主里面的神性；根据基督教界的信仰教义，这神性如同人身体里面的灵魂。来自这神性的人身本身是神的儿子。由于这人身变成了神性，所以为防止只靠近父，并由此在思维、信仰，因而敬拜上将父与父在里面的主分离，主在教导祂与父为一；父在祂里面，祂在父里面；人要住在祂里面；若不藉着祂，没有人能到父那里去之后，又教导，我们必须信祂，人因对祂的信而得救。</p><p>基督教界的许多人对以下事实无法形成任何概念：主里面的人身变成神性；主要原因是，他们从人的物质身体和属灵身体来理解人。然而，真理是：属灵的天使也是完美形式的人；从耶和华神发出的一切神性事物，从它在天堂的最初事物，到它在世界的最终事物，都拥有一种朝向人形的倾向。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 32</h4><p>32. 3. The Lord made the human nature divine from the divine nature within himself. There is support for this in many passages in the Word. Here we select passages that support the following points.<p>a. This happened step by step:<p>Jesus grew and became strong in spirit and in wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_40.htm">Luke 2:40</a>)<p>Jesus increased in wisdom and age, and in favor with God and humankind. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>)</p><p>[2] b. The divine nature worked through the human nature the way a soul works through its body:<p>The Son cannot do anything on his own unless he sees the Father doing it. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_19.htm">John 5:19</a>)<p>I do nothing of myself; as my Father taught me I say these things. The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_28.htm">John 8:28-29</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_30.htm">5:30</a>)<p>I have not spoken on my own authority; the Father who sent me has given me a commandment regarding what I should say and what I should speak. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_49.htm">John 12:49-50</a>)<p>The words that I speak to you I do not speak on my own authority; the Father who dwells in me does these works. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_10.htm">John 14:10</a>)<p>I am not alone, because the Father is with me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_32.htm">John 16:32</a>)</p><p>[3] c. The divine nature and the human nature worked in complete accord:<p>Whatever the Father does, the Son also does in the same way. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_19.htm">John 5:19</a>)<p>Just as the Father raises the dead and brings them to life, so also the Son brings to life those whom he wishes to. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_21.htm">John 5:21</a>)<p>Just as the Father has life in himself, so he has also granted the Son to have life in himself. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_26.htm">John 5:26</a>)<p>Now they know that all things you have given me are from you. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_7.htm">John 17:7</a>)</p><p>[4] d. The divine nature was united to the human nature and the human nature to the divine:<p>“If you have known me you have also known my Father and have seen him.” When Philip wanted to see the Father, Jesus said, “Have I been with you for so long, and yet you have not known me, Philip? Those who have seen me have seen the Father. Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7-11</a>)<p>If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me. If I am doing them, believe the works, so that you may know and believe that the Father is in me and I am in the Father. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_37.htm">John 10:37-38</a>)<p>... so that they all may be one, as you, Father, are in me and I am in you. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_21.htm">John 17:21</a>)<p>On that day you will know that I am in my Father. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>)<p>No one will snatch the sheep from my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_29.htm">John 10:29-30</a>)<p>The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>)<p>All things that the Father has are mine. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_15.htm">John 16:15</a>)<p>All that is mine is yours, and all that is yours is mine. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_10.htm">John 17:10</a>)<p>You have given the Son power over all flesh. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_2.htm">John 17:2</a>)<p>All power has been given to me in heaven and on earth. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>)</p><p>[5] e. We should turn to the Divine-Human One, as we can see from the following passages:<p>... so that all people will honor the Son just as they honor the Father. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_23.htm">John 5:23</a>)<p>If you had known me, you would also have known my Father. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_19.htm">John 8:19</a>)<p>Those who see me see the one who sent me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_45.htm">John 12:45</a>)<p>If you have known me you have also known my Father, and from now on you know him and have seen him. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7</a>)<p>Those who accept me accept the one who sent me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_20.htm">John 13:20</a>)<p>This is because no one can see the divinity itself that is called “the Father”; only the Divine-Human One can be seen. The Lord in fact said,<p>No one has ever seen God. The only-begotten Son, who is close to the Father’s heart, has made him visible. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>)<p>No one has seen the Father except the one who is with the Father. He has seen the Father. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_46.htm">John 6:46</a>)<p>You have never heard the Father’s voice or seen what he looks like. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>)</p><p>[6] f. Since the Lord made his human nature divine from the divine nature within himself, and since we should turn to him and he is the Son of God, we are therefore to believe in the Lord who is both Father and Son, as we can see from the following passages.<p>Jesus said that as many as accepted him, he gave them power to become children of God and believe in his name. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>)<p>... so that all who believe in him will not perish but will have eternal life. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_15.htm">John 3:15</a>)<p>God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son so that everyone who believes in him would have eternal life. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_16.htm">John 3:16</a>)<p>Those who believe in the Son are not condemned; but those who do not believe have already been condemned because they have not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>)<p>Those who believe in the Son have eternal life. Those who do not believe in the Son will not see life; instead, the wrath of God abides on them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>)<p>The bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. Those who come to me will not hunger, and those who believe in me will never thirst. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_33.htm">John 6:33</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_35.htm">35</a>)<p>This is the will of the one who sent me, that all those who see the Son and believe in him will have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>)<p>They said to Jesus, “What should we do in order to perform the works of God?” Jesus answered, “This is the work of God, that you believe in the one whom he has sent.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_28.htm">John 6:28-29</a>)<p>Truly I say to you, those who believe in me have eternal life. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_47.htm">John 6:47</a>)<p>Jesus cried out, saying, “If any are thirsty, they must come to me and drink. As the Scripture has said, from the bellies of those who believe in me will flow rivers of living water.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_7_37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>)<p>If you do not believe that I am, you will die in your sins. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_24.htm">John 8:24</a>)<p>Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life. Even if they die, those who believe in me will live; and anyone who lives and believes in me will never die.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>)<p>Jesus said, “I have come into the world as a light so that anyone who believes in me will not remain in darkness.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_46.htm">John 12:46</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_12.htm">8:12</a>)<p>While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of the light. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>)<p>I tell you truly, the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_25.htm">John 5:25</a>)<p>Abide in me, and I [will abide] in you. I am the vine; you are the branches. Those who abide in me and in whom I abide bear much fruit, because without me you cannot do anything. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_1.htm">John 15:1-5</a>)<p>They were to abide in the Lord, and the Lord in them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_23.htm">17:23</a>)<p>I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>)</p><p>[7] In these passages and all others, when it mentions “the Father” it means the divine nature that was in the Lord from his conception, which-according to the teaching embraced by the Christian world regarding faith-was like the soul within the body in human beings. The human nature that came from this divine nature is the Son of God.<p>Now, since this was also made divine, in order to prevent people from turning to the Father alone and thereby separating the Father from the Lord (in whom the Father dwells) in their thought, faith, and worship, the Lord went on to teach that the Father and he are one and that the Father is in him and he is in the Father, and that we are to abide in him; also that no one comes to the Father except through him. He also tells us that we are to believe in him and that we are saved by a faith focused directly on him.</p><p>[8] For many Christians, it is impossible to grasp the concept that in the Lord a human nature was made divine, primarily because they think of “human” only in terms of the physical body and not in terms of anything spiritual. Yet all angels, who are spiritual beings, also have a completely human form, and everything divine that emanates from Jehovah God, everything from its first [or innermost] level in heaven to its last [or outermost] level on earth, tends to take on a human form.<p>On angels as human forms and on everything divine tending toward the human form, see <a href="../hh/73.htm">Heaven and Hell 73-77</a>, <a href="../hh/453.htm">453-460</a>. There will also be more on this subject in forthcoming works that will draw on angelic wisdom about the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 32</h4><p>32. The Lord made His humanity Divine from the Divine in Him. This can be seen from many passages in the Word, and we will now cite those which establish<p>1. that He did so gradually, as follows:<p>(Jesus) grew and became strong in spirit (and) wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_40.htm">Luke 2:40</a>)<p>Jesus progressed in wisdom, in maturity, and in favor with God and men. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>)</p><p>[2] 2. That the Divine operated through the human, as the soul does through the body is established from the following:<p>...the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do.... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_19.htm">John 5:19</a>)<p>...I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things. He who sent Me is with Me. (He) has not left Me alone.... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_28.htm">John 8:28</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_20.htm">20</a>, cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_30.htm">5:30</a>)<p>...I have not spoken on My own, but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say and what I should speak. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_49.htm">John 12:49-50</a>)<p>The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own; the Father who dwells in Me does the works. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_10.htm">John 14:10</a>)<p>...I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_32.htm">John 16:32</a>)</p><p>[3] 3. That the Divine and human operated together is established from the following:<p>...whatever (the Father) does, the Son also does in like manner. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_19.htm">John 5:19</a>)<p>...as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them, even so the Son gives life to whom He will. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_21.htm">John 5:21</a>)<p>...as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself.... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_26.htm">John 5:26</a>)<p>Now they have known that all things which You have given Me are from You. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_7.htm">John 17:7</a>)</p><p>[4] 4. That the Lord united the Divine to the Human, and the Human to the Divine is established from the following:<p>If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and...you have seen Him....<p>(He said to Philip, who wished to see the Father,) Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father.... Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? ...Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me.... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7-11</a>)<p>If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me; if I do..., believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in (the Father). (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_37.htm">John 10:37-38</a>)<p>...that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_21.htm">John 17:21</a>)<p>At that day you will know that I am in My Father.... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>)<p>...no one is able to snatch (the sheep) out of My Father’s hand. I and My Father are one.

Because the Lord made His humanity Divine from the Divine in Him, and because one must turn to it, it being the Son of God, therefore one must believe in the Lord, who is both Father and Son.

The humanity itself originating from that Divinity is the Son of God.<p>Now because this, too, became Divine, and in order to keep people from turning to the Father alone and so in thought, faith and their resulting worship separating the Father from the Lord in whom the Father is, therefore after the Lord taught that the Father and He are one, that the Father is in Him and He in the Father, that His followers should abide in Him, and that no one comes to the Father except through Him, He taught in addition that people should believe in Him, and that a person is saved by a faith focused on Him.</p><p>[8] Any idea that the humanity in the Lord became Divine is impossible for many in the Christian world to comprehend, chiefly because they think of a person in terms of his material body and not in terms of his spiritual one, even though angels, who are spiritual beings, are fully human in form, and everything Divine that emanates from Jehovah God, from the firsts of it in heaven to the lasts of it in the world, inclines to the human form.<p>That angels are human in form, and that everything Divine inclines to the human form, may be seen in the book <a href="../hh/73.htm">Heaven and Hell 73-77</a> and nos. <a href="../hh/453.htm">453-460</a>. It may also be seen more fully in works after this which will be works of angelic wisdom regarding the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Dick translation 1954) 32</h4><p>32. 3. THE LORD MADE HIS HUMAN DIVINE FROM THE DIVINE IN HIMSELF. This may appear from many places in the Word from which will now be quoted passages confirming the following propositions: <p>(1) This was done successively. <p>Jesus grew and waxed strong in spirit and in wisdom: and the grace of God was upon Him. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_40.htm">Luke 2:40</a>. <p>Jesus increased in wisdom and age, and in favour with God and men. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>.<p> </p><p>[2] (2) The Divine operated through the Human, as the soul does through the body. This appears from the following passages: <p>The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_19.htm">John 5:19</a>. <p>I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. <p>And He that hath sent me is with me: He hath not left me alone. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_28.htm">8:28-29</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_30.htm">5:30</a>. <p>I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent me, He gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_49.htm">12:49-50</a>. <p>The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself, but the Father, that dwelleth in me, He doeth the works. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_10.htm">14:10</a>. <p>I am not alone, because the Father is with me. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_32.htm">16:32</a>.<p> </p><p>[3] (3) The Divine and the Human operated unanimously. This appears from the following passages: <p>What things soever the Father doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_19.htm">John 5:19</a>. <p>As the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom He will. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_21.htm">5:21</a>. <p>As the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_26.htm">5:26</a>. <p>Now they have known that all things which thou hast given me are of thee. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_7.htm">17:7</a>.<p> </p><p>[4] (4) The Divine is united to the Human and the Human to the Divine. This appears from these passages: <p>If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and ye ... have seen Him. <p>Jesus said to Philip who desired to see the Father, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father ... <p>Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me ...? <p>Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6-11</a>. <p>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. <p>But if I do ... believe the works; that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_37.htm">John 10:37-38</a>. <p>That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_21.htm">John 17:21</a>. <p>At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>. <p>No one is able to pluck my sheep out of my Father's hand. I and my Father are one. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_29.htm">John 10:29-30</a>. <p>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>. <p>All things that the Father hath are mine. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_15.htm">John 16:15</a>. <p>All mine are thine, and thine are mine. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_10.htm">John 17:10</a>. <p>Thou hast given the Son power over all flesh. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_2.htm">John 17:2</a>. <p>All power is given unto me in heaven and on earth. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>.<p> </p><p>[5] (5) The Divine Human is to be approached. This is manifest from the following passages: <p>That all men should honour the Son, as they honor the Father. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_23.htm">John 5:23</a>. <p>If ye had known me, ye should have known My Father also. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_19.htm">John 8:19</a>. <p>He that seeth me seeth Him that sent me. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_45.htm">John 12:45</a>. <p>If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also; and from henceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7</a>. <p>He that receiveth me receiveth Him that sent me. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_20.htm">John 13:20</a>. <p>The reason of this is, that no one can see the Divine itself, which is called the Father, but he may see the Divine Human. For the Lord says, <p>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>. <p>No one hath seen the Father save He who is with the Father; He hath seen the Father. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_46.htm">John 6:46</a>. <p>Ye have neither beard the Father's voice at any time, nor seen His shape. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>.<p> </p><p>[6] (6) Since the Lord made His Human Divine from the Divine in Himself, and since the Human is to be approached, and is the Son of God; it is therefore necessary to believe on the Lord, who is both Father and Son. This is manifest from the following passages: <p>Jesus said, As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become sons of God, even to them that believe on His name. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>. <p>That whosoever believeth on Him should not perish, but have eternal life. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_15.htm">John 3:15</a>. <p>God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish, but have eternal life. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_16.htm">John 3:16</a>. <p>He that believeth on the Son is not judged: but he that believeth not is judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only-begotten Son of God. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>. <p>He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>. <p>The bread of God is He that cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world ... <p>He that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_33.htm">John 6:33</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_35.htm">35</a>. <p>This is the will of Him that sent me, that every one who seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>. <p>They said unto Jesus, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered, This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_28.htm">John 6:28-29</a>. <p>Verily I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_47.htm">John 6:47</a>. <p>Jesus cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. <p>He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_7_37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>. <p>If ye believe not that I am, ye shall die in your sins. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_24.htm">John 8:24</a>. <p>Jesus said ...

The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_25.htm">John 5:25</a>. <p>Abide in me, and I in you. <p>I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>. <p>They were to abide in the Lord, and the Lord in them. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_23.htm">17:23</a>. <p>I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by me. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_6.htm">14:6</a>.<p> </p><p>[7] In these passages, and in all others where the Father is mentioned, the Divine that was in the Lord from conception is meant; which, according to the doctrine of faith of the Christian world, was as the soul in the body with man. The Human itself from this Divine is the Son of God. Now, since this also was made Divine; and, lest man should approach the Father alone, and thereby in thought, faith, and consequently in worship should separate the Father from the Lord in whom He is, therefore, after teaching that the Father and He are one, that the Father is in Him and He in the Father, that man should abide in Him, and that no one cometh to the Father but through Him, the Lord further teaches that we must believe in Him and that man is saved by a faith directed to Him.<p> </p><p>[8] That the Human in the Lord was made Divine is a truth of which many in Christendom can form no conception; chiefly for the reason that they think concerning man from his material and not from his spiritual body; although all angels, who are spiritual beings, are also men, perfect in form; and everything Divine proceeding from Jehovah God, from its first things in heaven to its last in the world, has a tendency towards the human form. Angels are in the human form, and every thing Divine tends to that form; as may be seen in the work <a href="../hh/73.htm">HEAVEN AND HELL 73-77</a>, <a href="../hh/453.htm">453-460</a>, and will be more fully illustrated in subsequent works, from angelic wisdom concerning the Lord. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Potts translation 1904) 32</h4><p>32. iii. That the Lord made His Human Divine from the Divine in Himself, is evident from many passages of the Word, of which those shall be here adduced which confirm: <p>1. That this was done by successive steps: <p>Jesus grew and waxed strong in spirit and in wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_40.htm">Luke 2:40</a>). <p>Jesus increased in wisdom, in age, and in grace with God and men (verse <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_2_52.htm">52</a>).</p><p>[2] 2. That the Divine operated through the Human, as the soul does through the body: <p>The Son can do nothing from Himself, but what He seeth the Father doing (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_19.htm">John 5:19</a>). <p>I do nothing of Myself, but as My Father hath taught Me, I speak these things and He that hath sent Me is with Me He hath not left Me alone (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_28.htm">John 8:28, 29</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_30.htm">5:30</a>). <p>I have not spoken of Myself, but the Father who sent Me, He hath given Me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_49.htm">John 12:49</a>). <p>The words that I speak unto you I speak not of Myself, but the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_10.htm">John 14:10</a>). <p>I am not alone, because the Father is with Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_32.htm">John 16:32</a>).</p><p>[3] 3. That the Divine and Human operated unanimously: <p>What things soever the Father doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_19.htm">John 5:19</a>). <p>As the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom He will (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_21.htm">John 5:21</a>). <p>As the Father hath life in Himself so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_26.htm">John 5:26</a>). <p>Now they have known that all things which Thou hast given Me, are of Thee (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_7.htm">John 17:7</a>).</p><p>[4] 4. That the Divine was united to the Human, and the Human to the Divine: <p>If ye had known Me ye would have known My Father also; and ye have seen Him. He said to Philip, who desired to see the Father, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip? He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father. Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? Believe Me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7-11</a>). <p>If I do not the works of My Father, believe Me not; but if I do, believe the works; that ye may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_37.htm">John 10:37, 38</a>). <p>That they all may be one, as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_21.htm">John 17:21</a>). <p>At that day ye shall know that I am in My Father (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>). <p>No one is able to pluck the sheep out of My Father's hand; I and the Father are one (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_29.htm">John 10:29, 30</a>). <p>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_35.htm">John 3:35</a>). <p>All things that the Father hath are Mine (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_15.htm">John 16:15</a>). <p>All Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_10.htm">John 17:10</a>). <p>Thou hast given the Son power [potestas] over all flesh (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_2.htm">John 17:2</a>). <p>All power [potestas] is given unto Me in heaven and on earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).</p><p>[5] 5. That the Divine Human is to be approached, is evident from these passages: <p>That all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_23.htm">John 5:23</a>). <p>If ye had known Me, ye would have known My Father also (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_19.htm">John 8:19</a>). <p>He that seeth Me, seeth Him that sent Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_45.htm">John 12:45</a>). <p>If ye had known Me, ye would have known My Father also; and from henceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_7.htm">John 14:7</a>). <p>He that receiveth Me, receiveth Him that sent Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_20.htm">John 13:20</a>). The reason of this is that no one can see the Divine Itself which is called "the Father;" but the Divine Human can be seen; for the Lord says, <p>No one hath seen God at any time the Only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath set Him forth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_18.htm">John 1:18</a>). <p>Not that any one hath seen the Father, save He that is with the Father; He hath seen the Father (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_46.htm">John 6:46</a>). <p>Ye have not heard the Father's voice at any time, nor seen His shape (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_37.htm">John 5:37</a>).</p><p>[6] 6. As the Lord made His Human Divine from the Divine in Himself, and as the Human is to be approached, and as the Son of God, we must put our faith in the Lord, who is both Father and Son. This is evident from these passages: <p>Jesus said, As many as received Him, to them gave He power [potestas] to be the sons of God, even to them that believe in His name (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_12.htm">John 1:12</a>). <p>That whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_15.htm">John 3:15</a>). <p>God so loved the world that He gave His Only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should have eternal life (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_16.htm">John 3:16</a>). <p>He that believeth in the Son is not judged; but he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the Only-begotten Son of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_18.htm">John 3:18</a>). <p>He that believeth in the Son hath eternal life; but he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_36.htm">John 3:36</a>). <p>The bread of God is He that cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. He that cometh to Me shall never hunger, and he that believeth in Me shall never thirst (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_33.htm">John 6:33</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_35.htm">35</a>). <p>This is the will of Him that sent Me, that everyone who seeth the Son, and believeth in Him, may have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_40.htm">John 6:40</a>). <p>They said to Jesus, What shall we do that we may work the works of God? Jesus answered, This is the work of God, that ye believe in Him whom He hath sent (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_28.htm">John 6:28, 29</a>). <p>Verily I say unto you, He that believeth in Me hath eternal life (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_47.htm">John 6:47</a>). <p>Jesus cried, saying, If anyone thirst let him come unto Me and drink; he that believeth in Me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_7_37.htm">John 7:37, 38</a>). <p>Unless ye believe that I am, ye shall die in your sins (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_24.htm">John 8:24</a>). <p>Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, shall live and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_11_25.htm">John 11:25, 26</a>). <p>Jesus said, I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth in Me should not abide in darkness (John <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_46.htm">12:46</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_12.htm">8:12</a>). <p>While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>). <p>Verily I say unto you, that the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_25.htm">John 5:25</a>). <p>Abide in Me, and I in you. I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without Me ye can do nothing (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_15_4.htm">John 15:4, 5</a>). <p>That they should abide in the Lord, and the Lord in them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_20.htm">John 14:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_23.htm">17:23</a>). <p>I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one cometh unto the Father but by Me (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_6.htm">John 14:6</a>).</p><p>[7] In these and all other passages where "the Father" is mentioned, there is meant the Divine which was in the Lord from conception, and which, according to the Doctrine of Faith of the Christian world, was circumstanced as is the soul in the body with man. The Human itself from this Divine is the Son of God. Now as this Human was made Divine, therefore, in order to prevent man from approaching the Father only, and thereby in thought, faith, and thence in worship, separating the Father from the Lord in whom the Father is, after the Lord had taught that He and the Father are one; that the Father is in Him, and He in the Father; that all should abide in Him; and that no one cometh to the Father but by Him, He taught also that we must believe in Him, and that man is saved by a faith directed to Him.</p><p>[8] Many in Christendom can form no idea of the fact that the Human in the Lord was made Divine, the chief reason of which is that they think of a man from his material body, and not from his spiritual body. And yet the truth is that all the angels (who are spiritual) are also men in a complete form; and, what is more, the whole Divine which proceeds from Jehovah God, from its first principles in heaven, down to its ultimate in this world, has a tendency to the human form. <sup>1</sup><p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;That angels are human forms, and that everything Divine has a tendency to the human form, may be seen in the work on <a href="../hh/73.htm">Heaven and Hell 73-77</a>, <a href="../hh/453.htm">453-460</a>, and more fully in the works which follow this present one, which will be from Angelic Wisdom concerning the Lord. </p>
