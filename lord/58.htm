<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》 第58节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>L58.只要将三位格的三位一体理解为一个位格的三位一体，那么该信经的一切细节，如它口头上所陈述的那样，都是真实的。如果我们再将它转换一下，这一点是显而易见的，如：凡人欲得救，首先当持守基督教信仰；我等敬拜一体三位，而三位一体之神；其位不紊，其体不分；父子圣灵同一神性，同一荣耀，同一尊严；父如何，子如何，圣灵亦如何；父不受造，子不受造，圣灵亦不受造；父无限，子无限，圣灵亦无限；非三无限者，非三不受造者，乃一不受造者，一无限者；如是，父全能，子全能，圣灵亦全能；然而，非三全能者，乃一全能者；如是，父是神，子是神，圣灵亦是神；然而，非三神，乃一神；如是，父是主，子是主，圣灵亦是主；然而，非三主，乃一主；依基督真道，我等认一位内的三位，即神和主；依基督信仰，我等可谓一神和一主；父非由谁作成：既非受造，亦非受生；子独由于父：非作成，亦非受造；而为受生；圣灵由于父与子：既非作成，亦非受造，亦非受生，而为发出；如是，有一父，非三父，有一子，非三子，有一圣灵，非三圣灵；这三位一体无分大小，完全平等；由是如前所言，我等当敬拜一体三位，而三位一体之神。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 58</h4><p>58. If this whole doctrinal statement is rewritten as follows, [the point just made] becomes clear, that it is true right down to the individual words, provided that rather than a “trinity of persons” we understand it to be referring to a “trinity within one person”:<p>For all who want to be saved, it is necessary that they hold the Christian faith. And the Christian faith is this: That we worship one God in trinity, and trinity in unity, neither confounding the three aspects within his person nor dividing his essence. The three aspects within him as one person are what are referred to as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The divinity of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is all one, the glory and majesty equal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Spirit. The Father is uncreate, the Son is uncreate, and the Holy Spirit is uncreate. The Father is infinite, the Son is infinite, and the Holy Spirit is infinite. And yet there are not three infinite or three uncreated beings, but one uncreated and one infinite Being. So likewise the Father is almighty, the Son is almighty, and the Holy Spirit is almighty; and yet there are not three almighty beings, but one almighty Being. So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God; and yet there are not three gods, but one God. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son is Lord, and the Holy Spirit is Lord; and yet there are not three lords, but one Lord. Now, as in Christian truth we acknowledge three aspects in one person who is God and Lord, so in Christian faith we can say one God and one Lord. The Father is made by none, neither created nor begotten. The Son is from the Father alone, not made, nor created, but begotten. The Holy Spirit is from the Father and from the Son, neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits. And in this trinity none is greatest or least; they are absolutely equal. So in all things, as said above, the unity in trinity and the trinity in unity is to be worshipped. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 58</h4><p>58. We say that everything in this doctrine in its every word is true, provided one understands the trinity to be a trinity in the person instead of a trinity of persons, and that this can be seen from a rewriting of the doctrine. Here, then, is the rewritten version:<p>Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the Christian faith.... The Christian faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the trine in the person, nor dividing the essence. [For] there is a trine in one Person, called the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The Godhead or Divinity of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, is one and the same, the glory and the majesty equal.<p>Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Spirit. The Father is uncreated, the Son is uncreated, and the Holy Spirit is uncreated. The Father is infinite, the Son is infinite, and the Holy Spirit is infinite.... And yet...there are not three infinites, nor three uncreated, but one Uncreated, and one Infinite.<p>So likewise as the Father is Almighty, so the Son is Almighty, and the Holy Spirit is Almighty. And yet they are not three almighties, but one Almighty.<p>As the Father is God, so the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God. And yet they are not three gods, but one God.<p>Although the Father is Lord, the Son is Lord, and the Holy Spirit is Lord. And yet there are not three lords, but one Lord.<p>Now as in accord with the Christian verity we acknowledge a trine in one Person, who is God and Lord, so we can say, in accord with our Christian faith, one God and one Lord.<p>The Father is made of none, neither created, nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone, not made, nor created, but begotten. The Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son, neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.<p>So there is one Father, not three fathers; one Son, not three sons; one Holy Spirit, not three holy spirits. And in this Trinity...none is the greatest or the least, but they are entirely equal, so that it is altogether the case, as was said before, that the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshiped. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Dick translation 1954) 58</h4><p>58. All the particulars of this Creed, as it is verbally set forth, are true if, instead of a Trinity of Persons, we understand a Trinity of Person. This may appear if we transcribe it again, as follows: <p>He who would be saved must keep this Christian faith. This Christian faith is: We worship One God in the Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity, neither mingling the Trine of the Person, nor dividing the Essence. The Trine of the one Person is what is called the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is one and the same, the glory and the majesty equal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Spirit. The Father is uncreate, the Son is uncreate, and the Holy Spirit is uncreate. The Father is infinite, the Son is infinite, and the Holy Spirit is infinite; and yet there are not three infinites, nor three uncreates, but one Uncreate, and one Infinite. Similarly, as the Father is Almighty, so the Son is Almighty, and the Holy Spirit is Almighty; and yet there are not three Almighties, but one Almighty. <p>As the Father is God, so the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God; and yet there are not three Gods, but one God. Although the Father is Lord, the Son is Lord, and the Holy Spirit is Lord; yet there are not three Lords, but one Lord. Now, as by the Christian verity we acknowledge a Trine in one Person, who is God and Lord, so by the Christian faith we can say one God and one Lord. The Father was made of none, neither created nor born; the Son is of the Father alone, not made nor created, but born; the Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son, neither made, nor created, nor born, but proceeding. <p>Thus there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits. And in this Trinity none is greatest, or least, but they are altogether equal. So that it is just as was said above, that the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Potts translation 1904) 58</h4><p>58. That insofar as its verbal expressions are concerned, all things of this Creed are true, provided that instead of a Trinity of Persons there is understood a Trinity of Person, is evident from the same when rewritten in this form: <p>Whosoever will be saved, it is necessary that he hold this Christian Faith; and the Christian Faith is, that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, not confounding the Trine of Person, nor dividing the Essence. The Trine of one Person is what is called the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Divinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is one and the same, the glory and majesty equal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Spirit. The Father is uncreate, the Son uncreate, and the Holy Spirit uncreate. The Father is infinite, the Son infinite, and the Holy Spirit infinite. And yet there are not three infinities, nor three uncreates, but one Uncreate, and one Infinite. So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty, and the Holy Spirit Almighty; and yet there are not three almighties, but one Almighty. So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God; and yet there are not three gods, but one God. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son is Lord, and the Holy Spirit is Lord; and yet there are not three lords, but one Lord. For as by the Christian verity we acknowledge a trine in one Person, who is God and Lord, so by the Christian faith we can say one God and one Lord. The Father is made of none, neither created, nor born the Son is of the Father alone, not made, nor created, but born the Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son, not made, nor created, nor born, but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits. And in this Trinity none is greatest or least, but they are altogether equal. So that in all things, as is aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, is to be worshiped. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 58 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>58. Quod omnia illius Doctrinae quoad singula ejus verba, sint vera, modo pro trinitate Personarum intelligatur trinitas Personae, constare potest ex eadem denuo exscripta, quae nunc sequitur:- <p>Qui vult salvari, illi necessarium est servare fidem hanc Christianam. Fides haec Christiana est: Quod colamus unum Deum in Trinitate, et Trinitatem in Unitate, non commiscendo Trinum Personae, neque separando Essentiam. Trinum unius Personae est, quod Pater, Filius et Spiritus Sanctus vocatur. Divinitas Patris, Filii et Spiritus Sancti est una eadem, gloria et majestas aequalis. Qualis est Pater, talis est Filius, et talis est Spiritus Sanctus. Pater est increatus, Filius est increatus, et Spiritus Sanctus est increatus; Pater est infinitus, Filius est infinitus, et Spiritus Sanctus est infinitus; et tamen non sunt tres infiniti, neque tres increati, sed unus increatus et unus infinitus. Similiter ut Pater est omnipotens, ita Filius est omnipotens, et Spiritus Sanctus est omnipotens, et tamen non sunt tres omnipotentes, sed unus omnipotens. Sicut Pater est Deus, ita Filius est Deus, et Spiritus Sanctus est Deus, et tamen non sunt tres Dii, sed unus Deus. Quamvis Pater est Dominus. Filius est Dominus, et Spiritus Sanctus est Dominus, usque tamen non sunt tres Domini, sed unus Dominus. Nunc sicut ex Christiana veritate agnoscimus trinum in una Persona, quae Deus et Dominus, ita ex Christiana fide possumus dicere unum Deum et unum Dominum. Pater a nullo factus est, neque Creatus, neque natus: Filius est ex solo Patre, non factus, nec Creatus, sed natus: Spiritus Sanctus est ex Patre et ex Filio, neque factus, neque creatus, neque natus, sed procedens: ita est unus Pater, non tres Patres, unus Filius, non tres Filii, unus Spiritus Sanctus, non tres Spiritus Sancti: et in hac Trinitate nullus est maximus et minimus, sed sunt prorsus aequales. Ita ut prorsus sit, quemadmodum supra dictum est, quod Unitas in Trinitate, et Trinitas in Unitate colenda sit. </p>
