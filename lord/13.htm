<h4 align="center"></h4><p>L13.主通过十字架受难完全征服了地狱，祂自己在约翰福音教导了这一点：</p><p>现在这世界受审判，现在这世界的王要被赶出去。（约翰福音12:31）</p><p>当十字架受难即将发生时，主说了这话。同一福音书：</p><p>这世界的王受了审判。（约翰福音16:11）</p><p></p><p>你们可以放心，我已经胜了世界。（约翰福音16:33）</p><p>路加福音：</p><p>耶稣说，我曾看见撒旦从天上坠落，像闪电一样。（路加福音10:18）</p><p>在这些经文中，“世界“、“世界的王”、“撒旦”和“魔鬼”都表示地狱。主通过十字架受难还完全荣耀了祂的人身，祂在约翰福音中教导了这一点：</p><p>犹大既出去，耶稣就说，如今人子得了荣耀，神在祂身上也得了荣耀。神若在祂身上得荣耀，神也要因自己荣耀祂，并且要快快地荣耀祂。（约翰福音13:31，32）</p><p>同一福音书：</p><p>父啊，时刻到了，愿你荣耀你的儿子，使儿子也荣耀你。（约翰福音17:1）</p><p></p><p>现在我的灵魂愁烦；祂说，父啊，愿你荣耀你的名。当时就有声音从天上来说，我已经荣耀了它，还要再荣耀。（约翰福音12:27，28）</p><p>路加福音：</p><p>基督这样受害，又进入祂的荣耀，岂不是应当的吗？（路加福音24:26）</p><p>这些话是指着祂的受难说的。荣耀就是神性与人身的合一；因此，经上说：“神要因祂自己荣耀祂”。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 13</h4><p>13. The Lord himself tells us in John that he completely defeated the hells by his suffering on the cross:<p>Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_31.htm">John 12:31</a>)<p>The Lord said this when his suffering on the cross was at hand. And again,<p>The ruler of this world is judged. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_11.htm">John 16:11</a>)<p>And again,<p>Take heart! I have overcome the world. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_33.htm">John 16:33</a>)<p>And in Luke,<p>Jesus said, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_18.htm">Luke 10:18</a>)<p>The world, the ruler of this world, Satan, and the Devil mean hell.<p>The Lord tells us in John that he also completely glorified his human nature by his suffering on the cross:<p>After Judas went out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Humanity is glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and glorify him immediately.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_31.htm">John 13:31-32</a>)<p>Again,<p>Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, so that your Son may also glorify you. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_1.htm">John 17:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_5.htm">5</a>)<p>And again,<p>“Now my soul is troubled.” And he said, “Father, glorify your name.” And a voice came from heaven, saying, “I both have glorified it and will glorify it again.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_27.htm">John 12:27-28</a>)<p>In Luke,<p>Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer this and enter into his glory? (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>)<p>These sayings were about his suffering. Glorification is the complete union of the divine nature and the human nature, so it says “God will also glorify him in himself.” </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 13</h4><p>13. That the Lord fully conquered the hells by His suffering of the cross is something He Himself teaches in John:<p>Now is the judgment of this world; now the prince of this world will be cast out. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_31.htm">John 12:31</a>)<p>This the Lord spoke when the passion of the cross was imminent. Again in John:<p>The prince of this world is judged. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_11.htm">John 16:11</a>)<p>Again:<p>...have faith, I have overcome the world. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_33.htm">John 16:33</a>)<p>And in Luke:<p>(Jesus) said..., “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_18.htm">Luke 10:18</a>)<p>The world, the prince of the world, Satan and the devil, all mean hell.</p><p>[2] That the Lord also fully glorified His humanity by His suffering of the cross is something He teaches in John:<p>After (Judas) had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him. If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and glorify Him immediately.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_31.htm">John 13:31-32</a>)<p>Again in John:<p>Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, that Your Son also may glorify You.... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_1.htm">John 17:1</a>, cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_5.htm">17:5</a>)<p>Again:<p>“Now My soul is troubled....” (And He said,) “Father, glorify Your name.” And a voice came from heaven..., “I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_27.htm">John 12:27-28</a>)<p>In Luke:<p>“Ought not the Christ to have suffered this and to enter into His glory?” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>)<p>These statements are made regarding the suffering of the cross. The Lord’s glorification is the uniting of His Divinity and humanity, which is why we are told, “God will also glorify Him in Himself.” </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Dick translation 1954) 13</h4><p>13. That by the passion of the cross the Lord fully conquered the hells, he Himself teaches in John: <p>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_31.htm">John 12:31</a>. <p>This the Lord said when the passion of the cross was about to take place. <p>In the same: <p>The prince of this world is judged. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_11.htm">John 16:11</a>. <p>Again: <p>Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_16_33.htm">John 16:33</a>. <p>And in Luke: <p>Jesus said, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_10_18.htm">Luke 10:18</a> In these passages by the world, the prince of the world, Satan and the devil, is meant hell. <p>That by the passion of the cross the Lord also fully glorified His Human, He teaches in John: <p>After Judas was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him. <p>If God be gloried in Him, God shall also glorify Him in Himself, and shall straightway glorify Him. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_13_31.htm">John 13:31-32</a>. <p>In the same: <p>Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_1.htm">John 17:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_5.htm">5</a>. <p>Again: <p>Now is my soul troubled. <p>And He said, Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_27.htm">John 12:27-28</a>. <p>In Luke: <p>Ought not Christ to have suffered this, and to enter into His glory? <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>. <p>These things are said concerning His passion. Glorification is the uniting of the Divine and the Human; therefore it is said, "God shall glorify Him in Himself." </p>
