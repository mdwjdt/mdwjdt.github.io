<h4 align="center"></h4><p>L47.⑴“灵”表示人的生命。这一点可从日常用语明显看出来：当一个人死了时，就说他交出了他的灵；因此，灵在这层意义上表示呼吸的生命。“灵”这个词源自呼吸；这就是为何在希伯来语，“灵或呼吸”和“风”都是用一个词。人里面有两个生命源泉：一个是心脏运动，一个是肺呼吸。“灵”，以及“灵魂”真正表示的是来自肺呼吸的生命。该生命与来自理解力的人之思维行如一体，来自心脏运动的生命与他的意愿之爱行如一体，这一点在适当地方将会看到。在圣言中，“灵（或呼吸，气，气息）”表示人的生命，这一点从下列经文明显看出来，诗篇：</p><p>你夺去它们的呼吸（灵），它们就死亡，归回尘土。（诗篇104:29）</p><p></p><p>祂记得他们不过是血肉，是一阵去而不返的风（灵）。（诗篇78:39）</p><p></p><p>他的气一断，就归回尘土。（诗篇146:4）</p><p>以赛亚书：</p><p>希西家哀叹，他灵的生命就要离开。（以赛亚书38:16）</p><p>创世记：</p><p>雅各的灵就苏醒了。（创世记45:27）</p><p>耶利米书：</p><p>铸像本是虚假的，其中并无气息。（耶利米书51:17）</p><p>以西结书：</p><p>主耶和华对这些枯骨如此说，我必使气息进入你们里面，你们就要活了。气息啊，要从四风而来，吹在这些被杀的人身上，使他们活了。于是，气息就进入枯骨，它们又活了。（以西结书37:5，6，9，10）</p><p>路加福音：</p><p>耶稣拉着睚鲁女儿的手，她的灵便回来，她就立刻起来了。（路加福音8:54，55）</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 47</h4><p>47. 1. “Spirit” refers to an individual’s life. This is clear from the fact that we commonly speak of “yielding up the spirit” when someone dies. In this sense, then, “spirit” means the life of our breathing. In fact, the word “spirit” is derived from [a word for] breathing, which is why in Hebrew the word that means “spirit” also means “wind.”<p>We have two inner springs of life. One is the motion of the heart, and the other is the breathing of the lungs. The life that depends on the breathing of the lungs is the one properly meant by “spirit” and also by “soul.” In the appropriate place there will be a description of the way this is coordinated with our cognitive thinking, while the life dependent on the motion of the heart is coordinated with the love associated with our will.<p>It is clear from the following passages that “spirit” in the Word refers to an individual’s life.<p>You gather in their spirit; they breathe their last and return to dust. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_29.htm">Psalms 104:29</a>)<p>He remembered that they were flesh, a spirit that departs and does not return. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_39.htm">Psalms 78:39</a>)<p>When their spirit leaves, they will return to the earth. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_146_4.htm">Psalms 146:4</a>)<p>Hezekiah expressed grief that “the life of his spirit” was departing. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_38_16.htm">Isaiah 38:16</a>)<p>The spirit of Jacob came back to life. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_45_27.htm">Genesis 45:27</a>)<p>A molded image is a lie, and there is no spirit within it. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_17.htm">Jeremiah 51:17</a>)<p>The Lord Jehovih said to the dry bones, “I will put spirit into you so that you will live. Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe on these people who have been killed, and they will live”; and the spirit came into them, and they came back to life. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_5.htm">Ezekiel 37:5-6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_9.htm">9-10</a>)<p>When Jesus took the daughter’s hand, her spirit returned, and she arose immediately.

<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 47</h4><p>47. Spirit means a person’s life. This can be seen from everyday speech, in which a person is said to yield up the spirit when he dies. Consequently spirit in this sense means the life in respiration. The word “spirit” is also derived from the Latin verb “to respire.” So it is that in Hebrew there is one word for spirit and wind.<p>There are two wellsprings of life in a person. One is the motion of the heart, and the other the respiration of the lungs. The life springing from the respiration of the lungs is properly meant by spirit, and also by the soul. That these operate in concert with a person’s thinking in accord with his intellect, but that life springing from the motion of the heart operates in a person in concert with his will’s love — this will be seen in its right place.</p><p>[2] That a person’s life is meant by spirit in the Word is clear from the following:<p>You gather their spirit, they die, and return to...dust. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_29.htm">Psalms 104:29</a>)<p>He remembered that they were flesh, spirit that passes away and does not come again. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_39.htm">Psalms 78:39</a>)<p>When his spirit departs, he will return to (the) earth. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_146_4.htm">Psalms 146:4</a>)<p>Hezekiah lamented that the life of his spirit would depart (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_38_16.htm">Isaiah 38:16</a>).<p>...the spirit of Jacob...revived. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_45_27.htm">Genesis 45:27</a>)<p>...his molded image is a lie, and there is no spirit in (it). (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_17.htm">Jeremiah 51:17</a>)<p>...said the Lord Jehovih to the (dry) bones: “...I will put spirit in you, that you may live....” “...Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe into these slain, that they may live.” ...and spirit came into them, and they lived again....

<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Dick translation 1954) 47</h4><p>47. 1. By SPIRIT IS MEANT THE LIFE OF MAN. This may be evident from common speech, in which a man is said to yield up the spirit when he dies; so that by spirit, in this sense, is meant the life of respiration. The word spirit also is derived from respiration <sup>1</sup>; and in Hebrew there is one word for spirit (breath) and wind. There are two springs of life in man; one is the motion of the heart, and the other is the respiration of the lungs. The life from the respiration of the lungs is what is properly meant by spirit, and also by soul. This acts in unison with the thought of man from the understanding, while the life from the motion of the heart acts in unison with the love of man's will, as will be seen in its proper place. That the life of man is meant by spirit (or breath) in the Word appears from the following passages: <p>Thou takest away their breath, they expire, and return to their dust. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>. <p>He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_39.htm">Psalm 78:39</a>. <p>When his breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_146_4.htm">Psalm 146:4</a>. <p>Hezekiah lamented that the life of his spirit should go out. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_38_16.htm">Isaiah 38:16</a>. <p>The spirit of Jacob revived. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_45_27.htm">Genesis 45:27</a>. <p>His molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in it. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_17.htm">Jeremiah 51:17</a>. <p>The Lord Jehovih said unto the dry bones, I will bring breath into you, that ye may live ... <p>Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. <p>... And the breath came into them, and they lived again. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_5.htm">Ezekiel 37:5-6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_9.htm">9-10</a>. <p>Jesus took the hand of the maiden. And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_8_54.htm">Luke 8:54-55</a>. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;Latin, spiro, I breathe; spiritus, breath, spirit. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Potts translation 1904) 47</h4><p>47. i. That by "spirit" is meant man's life, is evident from ordinary discourse, in which it is said that a man, when he dies, yields up his spirit, so that by "spirit" in this sense is meant the life of the respiration, and in fact the term "spirit" is derived from the respiration, and this is why, in the Hebrew language, there is one word for both "spirit" and "wind." There are in man two fountains of life, one is the motion of the heart, and the other is the respiration of the lungs. The life from the respiration of the lungs is what is properly meant by "spirit" and also by "soul." That this acts as one with the man's thought from the understanding, and that the life from the heart's motion acts as one with his will's love, will be seen in its own place. That man's life is meant in the Word by "spirit," is evident from these passages: <p>Thou gatherest in their breath [spiritum], they expire, and return into dust (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_104_29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>). <p>He remembered that they were flesh, a wind [spiritus] that passeth away, and cometh not again (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_78_39.htm">Psalm 78:39</a>). <p>When his breath has gone forth, he will return into earth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_146_4.htm">Psalm 146:4</a>). <p>Hezekiah lamented that the life of his spirit should go forth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_38_16.htm">Isaiah 38:16</a>). <p>The spirit of Jacob revived (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/genesis_45_27.htm">Genesis 45:27</a>). <p>A molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in it (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_51_17.htm">Jeremiah 51:17</a>). <p>The Lord Jehovih said to the dry bones, I will cause breath to enter into you, that ye may live. Come from the four winds O breath, and breathe upon these slain, and they shall live; and the breath came into them, and they revived (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_5.htm">Ezekiel 37:5-6</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_9.htm">9-10</a>). <p>Jesus took the daughter [of Jairus] by the hand, and her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_8_54.htm">Luke 8:54, 55</a>). </p>

Quod per "spiritum" intelligatur vita hominis, constare potest ex communi loquela, quod homo dicatur emittere spiritum, cum moritur; quare per "spiritum" in hoc sensu intelligitur vita respirationis; trahit etiam vox spiritus derivationem suam a respiratione; inde est, quod in lingua Hebraea una vox sit spiritus et venti. Sunt bini fontes vitae apud hominem; unus est motus cordis, et alter est respiratio pulmonis. Vita ex respiratione pulmonis est, quae proprie intelligitur per "spiritum," et quoque per "animam;" quae quod unum agat cum cogitatione hominis ex intellectu, at quod vita ex motu cordis unum agat cum amore voluntatis hominis, in suo loco videbitur.
