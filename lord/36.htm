<h4 align="center"></h4><p>L36.⑺神就这样成为人，正如在首先事物中那样，在末后事物中也是如此。神是一位人，每位天使和每个灵人都因神而为一个人，这一点在《天堂与地狱》一书有部分说明，在《天使的智慧》（即《圣爱与圣智）中将有进一步的详细说明。然而，神起初是在首先事物，而不是在末后事物中的一位人；但祂在世上取得人身后，在末后事物中也变成了一位人。这一点从刚才所证实的内容可推知，即：主将祂的人身与祂的神性合一，因而将祂的人身变成神性。正因如此，主被称为始和终，首先的和末后的，阿拉法和俄梅戛；如启示录：</p><p>我是阿拉法，是俄梅戛，是始，是终，是昔在、今在、以后永在的全能者。（启示录1:8，11）</p><p></p><p>七灯台中间有一位好像人子，约翰一看见祂，就仆倒在祂脚前，像死了一样；祂用右手按着我，说，我是首先的，是末后的。（启示录1:13，17；2:8；21:6）</p><p></p><p>看哪，我必快来！要照各人所行的报应他。我是阿拉法，是俄梅戛；是初，是终；是首先的，是末后的。（启示录22:12，13）</p><p>以赛亚书：</p><p>耶和华以色列的王，以色列的救赎者、万军之耶和华如此说，我是首先的，我是末后的。（以赛亚书44:6；48:12）</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 36</h4><p>36. 7. In this way, God became human on both the first [or innermost] level and the last [or outermost] level.<p>It is explained at some length in Heaven and Hell that God is human and that because of God all angels and spirits are human, and there will be more on this topic in the books about angelic wisdom.<p>While from the beginning God was human on the first [or innermost] level, he was not yet human on the last [or outermost] level. After he took on a human nature in the world, though, he also became human on the last [or outermost] level. This follows from what has been shown above, namely, that the Lord united his human nature with his divine nature and in this way made his human nature divine as well.<p>That is why the Lord is called the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last, and the Alpha and the Omega. This is in the Book of Revelation:<p>“I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, ” says the Lord, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11</a>)<p>When John saw the Son of Humanity in the midst of the seven lampstands,<p>[John] fell at his feet as dead, but [the Son of Humanity] laid his right hand on him, saying, “I am the First and the Last.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_8.htm">2:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a>)<p>Behold, I am coming quickly, to give to all according to what they have done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_12.htm">Revelation 22:12-13</a>)<p>And in Isaiah,<p>Thus says Jehovah the King of Israel, and Israel’s Redeemer, Jehovah Sabaoth: “I am the First and the Last.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_12.htm">48:12</a>) </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 36</h4><p>36. Thus God became man, as in the firsts of creation, so also in the lasts of it. God is human, and every angel and spirit is human because God is human, as we showed several times in the book Heaven and Hell, and as we will show additionally in short works with the title Angelic Wisdom.<p>From the beginning, however, God was human in the firsts of creation, but not in the lasts of it. Not until after He took on a humanity in the world did He become also human in outmost expressions. This follows from the confirmatory passages above, confirming that the Lord united His humanity to His Divinity, and so made His humanity also Divine.</p><p>[2] It is because of this that the Lord is called the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last, and the Alpha and the Omega, being called so in the book of Revelation:<p>“I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, ” says the Lord, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.

<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Dick translation 1954) 36</h4><p>36. 7. THUS GOD BECAME MAN, AS IN FIRST THINGS SO ALSO IN LAST. God is Man, and every angel and spirit is a man from God. This is shown in several places in the work HEAVEN AND HELL; and will be more fully shown in the small works on ANGELIC WISDOM. Now God from the beginning was Man in first things, but not in last; but after He assumed the Human in the world, He also became Man in ultimates. This follows from what has just been established, that the Lord united His Human to His Divine, and thus made His Human Divine also. Hence it is that the Lord is said to be the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last, and Alpha and Omega; as in Revelation: <p>I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, saith the Lord, He who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_8.htm">1:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_11.htm">11</a>. <p>When John saw the Son of Man-in the midst of the seven candlesticks ... he fell at His feet as dead. <p>But He laid His right hand upon him, saying ... I am the First and the Last. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_13.htm">1:13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_17.htm">17</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_2_8.htm">2:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_6.htm">21:6</a>. <p>Behold, I come quickly ... to give every man according to his work. <p>I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_22_12.htm">22:12-13</a> And in Isaiah: <p>Thus saith Jehovah, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Jehovah Zebaoth; I am the First and I am the Last. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_44_6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_48_12.htm">48:12</a>. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Potts translation 1904) 36</h4><p>36. vii. Thus God became Man, as in first principles so also in ultimates. That God is a Man, and that every angel and every spirit is a man from God, has been partially shown in the work on Heaven and Hell, and will be further shown in the works entitled Angelic Wisdom. From the beginning, however, God was a Man in first principles and not in ultimates; but after He had assumed the Human in the world, He became a Man in ultimates also. This follows from what has been already established-that the Lord united His Human to His Divine, and thus made His Human Divine.

Quod ita Deus factus sit Homo, ut in primis, etiam in ultimis.- Quod Deus sit Homo, et quod ex Deo omnis angelus et spiritus sit homo, in opere De Caelo et Inferno, aliquibus ostensum est; et ulterius in opusculis De Sapientia Angelica, ostendetur.- Sed Deus ab initio fuit Homo in primis, non autem in ultimis; at postquam suscepit Humanum in mundo, etiam factus est Homo in ultimis: hoc sequitur ex supra confirmatis, quod Dominus univerit Humanum suum Divino suo, et sic Humanum suum etiam Divinum fecerit.
