<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">三、主降世是为了征服地狱，荣耀祂的人身，十字架受难是最后的争战，祂由此完全征服地狱，完全荣耀祂的人身</h4><p>L12.教会知道，主征服了死亡，死亡是指地狱，后来祂在荣耀中升入天堂。但教会还不知道，主通过试探的争战征服死亡或地狱，同时又通过它们荣耀了祂的人身；十字架受难是最后的争战或试探，祂通过这次试探实现了这征服和荣耀。对于这些争战或试探，先知书和诗篇有大量论述了，但福音书没有那么多。祂在旷野的试探，后来魔鬼对祂的试探，以及最后祂在客西马尼园和十字架上所受的试探，概括性地描述了祂从小所承受的试探。祂在旷野中的试探，以及魔鬼对祂的试探，记载在三部福音（马太福音4:1-11；马可福音1:12，13；路加福音4:1-13）中。然而，这些试探是指祂的一切试探，甚至直到最后的试探。祂没有向门徒透露更多关于它们的信息；因为以赛亚书上说：</p><p>祂被欺压，却不开口。祂像羊羔被牵到宰杀之地，又像羊在剪毛的人手下无声，祂也是这样不开口。（以赛亚书53:7）</p><p>关于祂在客西马尼园的试探（参看马太福音26:36-44；马可福音14:32-42；路加福音22:39-46）。关于十字架上的试探（参看马太福音27:33-50；马可福音15:22-37；路加福音23:33-49；约翰福音19:17-34）。试探无非是与地狱的争战。关于主的试探或争战，可参看在伦敦出版的《新耶路撒冷及其属天教义》这本小册子（201，302节，关于总体上的试探，可参看本书187至200节）。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 12</h4><p>12. The Lord Came into the World to Subdue the Hells and to Glorify His Human Nature; the Suffering on the Cross Was the Last Battle by Which He Completely Defeated the Hells and Completely Glorified His Human Nature.<p>It is common knowledge in the church that the Lord conquered death, which means hell, and that afterward he ascended into heaven in glory. What the church does not know, though, is that the Lord conquered death or hell by means of battles that are tests, and in so doing also glorified his human nature; and that his suffering on the cross was the last battle or trial by which he effected the conquest and glorification.<p>This is treated of in many passages in the prophets and David, but not so frequently in the Gospels. In the Gospels the trials that he was subject to from his childhood are summed up in his trials in the wilderness, in his later trials by the Devil, and in the final trials he suffered in Gethsemane and on the cross.<p>On his trials in the wilderness and later by the Devil, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_4_1.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_1_12.htm">Mark 1:12-13</a>, and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_4_1.htm">Luke 4:1-13</a>. By these, however, are meant all his trials, even to the last. He did not disclose anything more about them to his disciples, for it says in Isaiah,<p>He was oppressed, but did not open his mouth, like a lamb being led to slaughter. Like a sheep before its shearers he kept silence and did not open his mouth. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_53_7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>)<p>On his trials in Gethsemane, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_36.htm">Matthew 26:36-44</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_32.htm">Mark 14:32-41</a>, and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_22_39.htm">Luke 22:39-46</a>; and on his trials on the cross, see <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_27_33.htm">Matthew 27:33-56</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_15_22.htm">Mark 15:22-38</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_23_33.htm">Luke 23:33-49</a>, and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_19_17.htm">John 19:17-37</a>. Trials are nothing more nor less than battles against the hells.
