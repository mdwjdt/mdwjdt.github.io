<h4 align="center"></h4><p>L27.⑷当论述救赎，拯救，改造和重生时，主被称为“人子”，这一点从以下经文明显看出来，马太福音：</p><p>人子来是要舍命，作多人的赎价。（马太福音20:28；马可福音10:45）</p><p>同一福音书：</p><p>人子来为要拯救失丧的人。（马太福音18:11；路加福音9:56）</p><p>路加福音：</p><p>人子来，为要寻找、拯救失丧的人。（路加福音19:10）</p><p>约翰福音：</p><p>人子来是要世界藉着祂得救。（约翰福音3:17）</p><p>马太福音：</p><p>那撒好种的就是人子。（马太福音13:37）</p><p>此处论述的是救赎和拯救，由于主通过圣言实现这一切，故祂在此自称“人子”。主说：</p><p>人子有赦罪的权柄。（马可福音2:10；路加福音5:24）</p><p>也就是得救。还有：</p><p>主是安息日的主，因为祂是人子。（马太福音12:8；马可福音2:28；路加福音6:5）</p><p>因为祂是圣言，那时祂自己教导圣言。此外，祂在约翰福音中说：</p><p>不要为那必坏的食物劳力，要为那存到永生的食物劳力，就是人子要赐给你们的。（约翰福音6:27）</p><p>“食物”表示来自圣言，因而来自主的教义的一切真理和良善。这一章的吗哪，和从天上降下来的粮，以及这一章下面的话也表示这一点：</p><p>你们若不吃人子的肉，不喝人子的血，就没有生命在你们里面。（约翰福音6:53）</p><p>“肉”，或“粮或食物”是指来自圣言的爱之良善；“血”或“酒”是指来自圣言的信之良善，这二者都来自主。</p><p>在提到“人子”的其它经文中，“人子”所表相同，如下列经文，马太福音：</p><p>狐狸有洞，飞鸟有窝，人子却没有枕头的地方。（马太福音8:20；路加福音9:58）</p><p>这句话表示圣言在犹太人当中没有一席之地，正如主所说的（约翰福音8:37）；它也不与他们同住，因为他们不承认祂（约翰福音5:38）。在启示录，“人子”也表示圣言方面的主：</p><p>我看见七灯台中间有一位好像人子，身穿长衣，直垂到脚，胸间束着金带。（启示录1:13）</p><p>此处以各种方式来代表圣言方面的主，因此，祂也被称为“人子”。诗篇：</p><p>愿你的手扶持你右手边的人，就是你为自己所坚固的人子。这样，我们便不退后离开你；求你救活我们。（诗篇80:17，18）</p><p>“你右手边的人”也表示圣言方面的主；“人子”也是。祂被称为“右手边的人”，是因为主凭神性真理，也就是圣而拥有能力。此外，当祂成全或应验了整部圣言时，祂就拥有了神性能力。因此，祂还说：</p><p>他们必看见人子坐在父的右手边，有大能力。（马可福音14:62）</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 27</h4><p>27. The Lord is called the Son of Humanity when the subject is redemption, salvation, reformation, and regeneration, as we can tell from the following:<p>The Son of Humanity came to give his life as a redemption for many. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>)<p>The Son of Humanity has come to save and not to destroy. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_11.htm">Matthew 18:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_56.htm">Luke 9:56</a>)<p>The Son of Humanity has come to seek and to save that which was lost. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>)<p>The Son of Humanity came so that the world would be saved through him. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17</a>)<p>The one who sows good seed is the Son of Humanity. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_37.htm">Matthew 13:37</a>)<p>Here the subject is redemption and salvation; and since they are effected by the Lord through the Word, he refers to himself as the Son of Humanity.<p>The Lord said that the Son of Humanity has power to forgive sins (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_10.htm">Mark 2:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_5_24.htm">Luke 5:24</a>)-that is, power to save. He also said that he was Lord of the Sabbath because he was the Son of Humanity (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_8.htm">Matthew 12:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_28.htm">Mark 2:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_5.htm">Luke 6:5</a>)-because he himself is the very Word that he is then teaching.<p>He also says in John,<p>Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Humanity will give you. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_27.htm">John 6:27</a>)<p>Food means everything true and good in the teaching drawn from the Word and therefore from the Lord. This is also the meaning of the manna and of the bread that comes down from heaven, as well as the meaning of these words in the same chapter:<p>Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Humanity and drink his blood, you will not have life within you. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_53.htm">John 6:53</a>)<p>The flesh or bread is good actions done from love as a result of the Word, and the blood or wine is good actions done from faith as a result of the Word, both of which come from the Lord.</p><p>[2] “The Son of Humanity” means much the same in various other passages where it is found, such as the following:<p>Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Humanity has nowhere to lay his head. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_58.htm">Luke 9:58</a>)<p>This means that the Word had no place among the Jews, as the Lord also says in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_37.htm">John 8:37</a>, and that the Word was not abiding in them, because they did not acknowledge him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_38.htm">John 5:38</a>).<p>The Son of Humanity means the Lord as the Word in Revelation as well:<p>In the midst of seven lampstands I saw one like the Son of Humanity, clothed with a garment down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a> and following)<p>In this passage various images are used to represent the Lord as the Word, so he is also called “the Son of Humanity.” In David:<p>Let your hand be with the man of your right hand, with the Son of Humanity whom you have strengthened for yourself. Then we will not turn back from you. Bring us to life. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_80_17.htm">Psalms 80:17-19</a>)<p>The man of your right hand in this passage is also the Lord as the Word, and so is the Son of Humanity. He is called “the man of your right hand” because the Lord has power from divine truth, which is also the Word; and he gained divine power when he fulfilled the whole Word. That is why he also said that they would see the Son of Humanity sitting at the right hand of the Father with power (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_62.htm">Mark 14:62</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 27</h4><p>27. The Lord is called the Son of man when the subject is redemption, salvation, reformation and regeneration. This is clear from the following:<p>...the Son of man (came) to give His life a redemption for many. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>)<p>...the Son of man has come to save..., (and) not...to destroy.... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_11.htm">Matthew 18:11</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_56.htm">Luke 9:56</a>)<p>...the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>)<p>(The Son of man came) that the world through Him might be saved. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17</a>)<p>He who sows the good seed is the Son of man. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_37.htm">Matthew 13:37</a>)<p>The subject there is redemption and salvation, because these are accomplished by the Lord through the Word, and the Lord therefore calls Himself the Son of man.<p>The Lord says that “the Son of man has power...to forgive sins” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_10.htm">Mark 2:10</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_5_24.htm">Luke 5:24</a>), that is, to save from them. Also, that He is Lord of the Sabbath, because He is the Son of man (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_8.htm">Matthew 12:8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_28.htm">Mark 2:28</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_5.htm">Luke 6:5</a>), since He is the Word that He teaches then. Moreover, He says in John:<p>Labor not for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give you.... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_27.htm">John 6:27</a>)<p>Food means all the truth and goodness of doctrine drawn from the Word, thus from the Lord.<p>This, too, is meant by the manna and bread referred to there that descended from heaven, and by the following declaration as well in the same chapter:<p>...unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink His blood, you have no life in you. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_53.htm">John 6:53</a>)<p>Flesh, or bread, is the goodness of love gained from the Word, while blood, or wine, is the goodness of faith gained from the Word, both originating from the Lord.</p><p>[2] The Son of man has the same symbolism in other places where the Son of man is mentioned. So, for example, in the following:<p>Foxes have holes and birds...have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay His head. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_58.htm">Luke 9:58</a>)<p>This means that the Word would have no place among the Jews, as the Lord also says in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_37.htm">John 8:37</a>. Nor would they have it abiding among them, because they did not acknowledge Him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_38.htm">John 5:38</a>).<p>The Son of man means the Lord in relation to the Word as well in the book of Revelation:<p>(I saw) in the midst of the seven lampstands one like the Son of man, clothed with a long robe and girded about the breasts with a golden girdle. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>ff.)<p>Various things in that book represent the Lord as the embodiment of the Word, for which reason He is called the Son of man.<p>In Psalms:<p>Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand, upon the Son of man whom You made strong for Yourself. Then we will not turn back from You; revive us.... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_80_17.htm">Psalms 80:17-18</a>)<p>The man of the right hand here as well is the Lord in relation to the Word, like the Son of man. He is called the man of the right hand because the Lord has power from Divine truth, which is also what the Word is, and He had Divine power when He fulfilled the whole of the Word. That is why He also said that people would see the Son of Man sitting at the right of the Father with power (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_62.htm">Mark 14:62</a>). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Dick translation 1954) 27</h4><p>27. 4. THE LORD IS CALLED THE SON OF MAN WHERE REDEMPTION, SALVATION, REFORMATION AND REGENERATION ARE TREATED OF. This is evident from the following passages: <p>The Son of Man came ... to give His life a ransom for many. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>. <p>The Son of Man is come to save and not to destroy. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_28_11.htm">Matthew 28:11</a>; <sup>1</sup><a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_56.htm">Luke 9:56</a>. <p>The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>. <p>The Son of Man came that the world through Him might be saved. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17</a>. <p>He that soweth the good seed is the Son of Man. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_37.htm">Matthew 13:37</a>. <p>Redemption and Salvation are here treated of; and as the Lord effects these by means of the Word, therefore He here calls Himself the Son of Man. <p>The Lord says <p>That the Son of Man has power to forgive sins. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_10.htm">Mark 2:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_5_24.htm">Luke 5:24</a>, that is, to save; <p>Also, that <p>He is the Lord of the sabbath, because He is the Son of Man. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_8.htm">Matthew 12:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_28.htm">Mark 2:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_5.htm">Luke 6:5</a> for He is the Word, which He then teaches. Moreover, He says in John: <p>Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man shall give unto you. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_27.htm">John 6:27</a>. <p>By meat is meant all truth and good of doctrine from the Word, and consequently from the Lord. This also is meant in that chapter by manna, and by the bread which came down from heaven; and also by the following words in the same chapter: <p>Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you. verse 53. <p>Flesh, or bread, is the good of love from the Word; blood, or wine, is the good of faith from the Word, and both are from the Lord.<p> </p><p>[2] THE SAME IS SIGNIFIED BY THE SON OF MAN WHEN SPOKEN OF IN OTHER PASSAGES; as in the following: <p>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man hath not where to lay His head. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_58.htm">Luke 9:58</a>. <p>By this is meant that the Word had no place with the Jews, as the Lord also says in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_37.htm">John 8:37</a>; nor did it abide with them, because they did not acknowledge Him, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_38.htm">John 5:38-39</a>. In Revelation also by the Son of Man is meant the Lord as to the Word: <p>I saw in the midst of the seven candlesticks One like unto the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a> and foll. <p>Here by various things the Lord is represented as to the Word and therefore He is also called the Son of Man. <p>In the Psalms: <p>Let thy hand be upon the Man (vir) of thy right hand, upon the Son of Man whom thou madest strong for thyself. <p>Then we will not go back from	thee: quicken thou us. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_80_17.htm">Psalm 80:17-18</a>. <p>The Man of the right hand is here also the Lord as to the Word; so, too, is the Son of Man. He is called The Man of the right because Lord has power by virtue of Divine Truth, which likewise is the Word. Moreover, He had Divine power when He had fulfilled the whole Word. Hence also He said <p>That they should see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Father with power. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_62.htm">Mark 14:62</a>. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;The printed text has xvii but the Latin is xviii. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Potts translation 1904) 27</h4><p>27. That the Lord is called "the Son of man" when Redemption, Salvation, Reformation, and Regeneration are treated of, is evident from these passages: <p>The Son of man came to give His life a redemption for many (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). <p>The Son of man is come to save, and not to destroy (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_18_11.htm">Matthew 18:11</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_56.htm">Luke 9:56</a>). <p>The Son of man is come to seek and save that which was lost (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_19_10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>). <p>The Son of man is come that the world through Him may be saved (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_17.htm">John 3:17</a>). <p>He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_13_37.htm">Matthew 13:37</a>). <p>Redemption and salvation are here treated of, and as the Lord effects these by means of the Word, He here calls Himself "the Son of man." <p>The Lord says, <p>That the Son of man has power [potestas] <sup>1</sup>to forgive sins (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_10.htm">Mark 2:10</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_5_24.htm">Luke 5:24</a>) (that is, to save). <p>And also, <p>That He is the Lord of the Sabbath, because He is the Son of man (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_12_8.htm">Matthew 12:8</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_2_28.htm">Mark 2:28</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_6_5.htm">Luke 6:5</a>) (i.e. because He is the Word, which He is Himself then teaching). <p>He says, further, in John: <p>Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_27.htm">John 6:27</a>). <p>By "meat" is meant all truth and good of doctrine from the Word, thus from the Lord; and this is also meant there by the manna, and by the bread which came down from heaven; and also by the following in the same chapter: <p>Except ye shall eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_6_53.htm">John 6:53</a>). <p>"Flesh," or "bread," is the good of love from the Word; "blood," or "wine," is the good of faith from the Word, both from the Lord.</p><p>[2] The like is signified by "the son of man" in other passages where He is mentioned, as in the following: <p>The foxes have holes, and the birds nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay His head (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_8_20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_58.htm">Luke 9:58</a>). <p>By this is meant that the Word would have no place among the Jews, as also the Lord said in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_8_37.htm">John 8:37</a> and also that they had it not abiding in them, because they had not acknowledged Him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_5_38.htm">John 5:38</a>). In Revelation also "the Son of man" means the Lord in respect to the Word: <p>In the midst of the seven lamp stands I saw one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>, etc.). <p>Here, in various ways, the Lord is represented as the Word, and He is therefore called "the Son of man." In David: <p>Let Thy hand he upon the man of Thy right hand, upon the Son of man whom Thou hast made strong for Thyself: so will not we go back from Thee; quicken us (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_80_17.htm">Psalm 80:17-18</a>). <p>"The man of Thy right hand," also means the Lord in respect to the Word; and so does "the Son of man." He is called "the man of the right hand," because the Lord has power from the Divine truth, which also the Word is, and He had Divine power when He had fulfilled the whole Word: and therefore He had said <p>That they should see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the Father, with power (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_14_62.htm">Mark 14:62</a>). <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;Potestas, Greek is the authority, command, and power that is exercised by a ruler.

Quod Dominus dicatur "Filius hominis" ubi agitur de Redemptione, Salvatione, Reformatione et Regeneratione, constat ex his:- <p>"Filius hominis venit,... ut det animam redemptionem pro multis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_27/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_20_28">Matthaeum 20:28</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_27/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_10_45">Marcus 10:45</a>); <p>"Venit Filius hominis ad salvandum," et non ad perdendum (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_27/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_18_11">Matthaeum 18:11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_27/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_9_56">Lucam 9:56</a>); <p>"Venit Filius hominis ad quaerendum et salvandum id quod perierat" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_27/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_19_10">Lucam 19:10</a>); <p>Venit Filius hominis, "ut mundus salvetur per Ipsum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_27/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_3_17">Johannem 3:17</a>); <p>"Qui seminat bonum semen est Filius hominis" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_27/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_13_37">Matthaeum 13:37</a>): <p>Ibi de redemptione et salvatione agitur; quae quia a Domino fiunt per Verbum, ideo Se vocat ibi "Filium hominis." Dicit Dominus, <p>Quod Filius hominis potestatem habeat remittendi peccata (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_27/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_2_10">Marcum 2:10</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_27/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_5_24">Lucam 5:24</a>), <p>Hoc est, salvandi.

Praeterea dicit apud Johannem, <p>"Operamini cibum, non qui perit, sed cibum qui manet in vitam aeternam, quem Filius hominis vobis dabit" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_27/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_6_27">6:27</a>): <p>Per "cibum" intelligitur omne verum et bonum doctrinae ex Verbo, ita a Domino: hoc quoque ibi intelligitur per "mannam," et per "panem" qui e caelo descendit; et quoque per hoc in eodem capite, <p>"Nisi comederitis carnem Filii hominis, et biberitis Ipsius sanguinem, non habebitis vitam in vobis" (vers. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_27/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_6_53">53</a>): <p>"caro" seu "panis" est bonum amoris ex Verbo, "sanguis" seu "vinum" est bonum fidei ex Verbo, utrumque a Domino.</p><p>[2] Simile per "Filium hominis," in aliis locis ubi dicitur, significatur.

Apud Davidem, <p>"Sit manus tua pro Viro dextrae tuae, pro Filio hominis confortasti Te; tunc non recedemus a Te; vivifica nos" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_27/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_80_18">Psalm 80:18</a>, [NCBSP: <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_27/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_psalms_80_17-18">Psalm 80:17-18</a>]): <p>"Vir dextrae" est quoque hic Dominus quoad Verbum; similiter "Filius hominis;" vocatur "Vir dextrae," quia Domino ex Divino Vero, quod etiam est Verbum, est potentia, ac Ipsi Divina Potentia fuit quando totum Verbum implevit: inde etiam dixerat, <p>Quod visuri sint "Filium hominis sedentem a dextris" Patris, cum potentia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_27/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_14_62">Marcum 14:62</a>). </p>
