<h3 align="center" class="ired">《新耶路撒冷教义之主篇》 第5节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>L5.在这些经文中，“日”和“时”表示主的降临。黑暗或幽暗、无光、荒废、罪孽尽头和毁灭之“日”或“时”表示主的降临，这时祂不再为人所知，因而教会的东西荡然无存。残忍和可畏的日子，烈怒、怒气、混乱、察罚、献祭、报应、困苦、战争、呼叫的日子表示主降临审判。主降临建立一个新教会，该教会将承认祂是救赎主和救主，由惟独尊崇耶和华的那一日来表示；在这日，耶和华的枝子必华美荣耀；在这日，义人要发旺；在这日，祂必养活，寻找祂的羊，立一个新约；在这日，大山要滴新酒或甜酒；在这日，必有活水从耶路撒冷出来；在这日，他们必仰望以色列的神，以及许多类似的话。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 5</h4><p>5. In these passages, day and time mean the Lord’s Coming. A day or time of darkness, gloom, thick darkness, no light, devastation, the iniquity of the end, or destruction means the Lord’s Coming, when he is no longer recognized and therefore when there is nothing left of the church.<p>A day that is cruel or terrifying, a day of blazing anger, wrath, panic, visitation, sacrifice, retribution, distress, war, or shouting means a coming of the Lord for judgment.<p>A day when Jehovah alone will be exalted, when he will be one and his name one, when the branch of Jehovah will be beautiful and glorious, when the righteous will flourish, when he will bring [a young cow and two sheep] to life, when he will search for his flock, when he will make a new covenant, when the mountains will drip with new wine, when living waters will go forth from Jerusalem, and when people will look back to the God of Israel (and many similar expressions) mean the Coming of the Lord to set up a new church that will recognize him as Redeemer and Savior. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 5</h4><p>5. “Day” or “time” in these passages mean the Lord’s advent.<p>A day of gloom, of darkness, of haziness, one without light, one of devastation, of the final iniquity, or of destruction, means the Lord’s advent when He was no longer known and when as a consequence nothing any longer of the church remained.<p>A cruel day, a dreadful day, a day of wrath, of anger, of tumult, of visitation, of sacrifice, of retribution, of distress, of war, or of a cry, means the Lord’s coming to judge.<p>A day when Jehovah alone will be exalted; when He shall be one and His name one; when an offshoot of Jehovah shall be beautiful and glorious; when the righteous shall flourish; when Jehovah shall vivify; when He will seek His flock; when He will make a new covenant; when the mountains drip new wine; when living waters flow from Jerusalem; when people will look to the God of Israel; and the like — these mean the Lord’s advent to establish a new church, one that will acknowledge Him as the redeemer and savior. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Dick translation 1954) 5</h4><p>5. In these passages by day and time is meant the Coming of the Lord. By a day or time of darkness, of thick darkness, of obscurity, of no light, of devastation, of the end of iniquity, and of destruction, is meant the Coming of the Lord when He was no longer known, and consequently when there was nothing of the Church remaining. By a day cruel and terrible, a day of wrath, of anger, of tumult, of visitation, of sacrifice, of retribution, of distress, of battle and of clamour, is meant the Coming of the Lord to judgment. His Coming to establish a new Church, which will acknowledge Him as Redeemer and Saviour, is meant by the day in which Jehovah alone should be exalted; in which He should be One and His name One; in which the Branch of Jehovah should be for comeliness and glory; in which the righteous should flourish; in which He should keep alive, seek His sheep and make a new covenant; in which the mountains should drop new wine (mustum), and living waters go out from Jerusalem in which they should look unto the God of Israel besides many similar expressions. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Potts translation 1904) 5</h4><p>5. In these passages by "day" and "time" is meant the advent of the Lord. By a "day" or "time" of darkness, of thick darkness, of gloom, of no light, of laying waste, of the end of iniquity, of destruction, is meant the advent of the Lord when He was no longer known, and when consequently there was no longer anything of the church left. By "a day" cruel, terrible, of wrath, of anger, of tumult, of visitation, of sacrifice, of recompense, of distress, of war, of a cry, is meant the advent of the Lord to Judgment. By "the day" in which Jehovah alone shall be exalted, in which He shall be one and His name one, in which the offshoot of Jehovah shall be for beauty and glory, in which the righteous shall flourish, in which He shall vivify, in which He shall seek His flock, in which He shall make a new covenant, in which the mountains shall drop new wine, in which living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, in which they shall look unto the God of Israel, and many similar expressions, is meant the advent of the Lord to set up again a new church which will acknowledge Him as the Redeemer and Savior. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 5 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>5. In his locis per "diem" et per "tempus" intelligitur Adventus Domini: per "diem" aut "tempus tenebrarum," "caliginis, "obscuritatis" "non lucis," "devastationis," iniquitatis finis," "interitus," intelligitur Adventus Domini, quando non amplius cognoscebatur, et inde quando non amplius aliquid ecclesiae supererat. Per "diem crudelem," "terribilem," "excandescentiae," "irae," "tumultus," "visitationis," "sacrificii," "retributionis," "angustiae," "belli," "clamoris," intelligitur Adventus Domini ad judicium. Per "diem quo exaltabitur Jehovah solus;" quo "unus erit et nomen Ipsius unum;" quo "erit germen Jehovae in decus et gloriam;" quo "florebit justus;" quo "vivificabit;" quo "quaeret gregem suum;" quo "feriet foedus novum;" quo "stillabunt montes mustum;" quo "exibunt aquae vivae ex Hierosolyma;" quo "respicient ad Deum Israelis," et plura similia, intelligitur Adventus Domini ad instaurandam ecclesiam novam, quae Ipsum agnoscet Redemptorem et Salvatorem. </p>
