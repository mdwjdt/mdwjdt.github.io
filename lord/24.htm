<h4 align="center"></h4><p>L24.⑴当论述主的受难时，祂被称为“人子”，这一点从以下经文明显看出来，马可福音：</p><p>耶稣对门徒说，看哪，我们上耶路撒冷去，人子将要被交给祭司长和文士，他们要定他死罪，把祂交给外邦人。他们要戏弄祂，向祂吐唾沫，杀害他。但第三天，祂要复活。（马可福音10:33，34）</p><p>在祂预言自己的受难的其它地方（如马太福音20:18，19；马可福音8:31；路加福音9:22），也是这样。</p><p>马太福音：</p><p>耶稣对门徒说，看哪，时刻到了，人子被出卖在罪人手里了。（马太福音26:45）</p><p>路加福音：</p><p>天使对进入坟墓的妇女说，要记得祂怎样对你们讲过，人子必须被交在罪人手里，钉在十字架上，第三日复活。（路加福音24:6，7）</p><p>那时主之所以自称“人子”，是因为祂让自己按他们对待圣言的方式受到对待，这在前面许多经文中已经说明。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 24</h4><p>24. The Lord is called the Son of Humanity when the subject is his suffering. This we can tell from the following passages.<p>Jesus said to his disciples, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Humanity will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn him to death and hand him over to the Gentiles, and they will whip him, and spit on him, and kill him. On the third day, though, he will rise again.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_33.htm">Mark 10:33-34</a>)<p>Likewise elsewhere, where it foretells his suffering, as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_18.htm">Matthew 20:18-19</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_8_31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>:<p>Jesus said to his disciples, “Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Humanity is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>)<p>The angel said to the women who came to the tomb, “Remember what he said to you: ‘The Son of Humanity must be betrayed into the hands of sinful people and be crucified and rise again on the third day.’” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_6.htm">Luke 24:6-7</a>)<p>The reason the Lord then called himself the Son of Humanity is that he allowed people to treat him the way they were treating the Word, as has already been explained more than once [, ]. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 24</h4><p>24. The Lord is called the Son of man when the subject is His suffering. This is clear from the following:<p>(Jesus said to His disciples:) “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes, who will condemn Him to death and deliver Him to the gentiles, and...they will...whip Him, and spit on Him, and kill Him. But on the third day He will rise again.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_33.htm">Mark 10:33-34</a>)<p>So, too, elsewhere, when the Lord predicts His suffering, as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_18.htm">Matthew 20:18-19</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_8_31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>, and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>.<p>(Jesus said to His disciples:) “Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>)<p>(The angel said to the women who came to the tomb:) “Remember what He said to you..., (that) the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_6.htm">Luke 24:6-7</a>)<p>The Lord called Himself the Son of man then because He allowed Himself to be treated in the same way that the people had treated the Word, as we showed many times above. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Dick translation 1954) 24</h4><p>24. 1. THE LORD IS CALLED THE SON OF MAN WHEN THE PASSION IS TREATED OF. This is evident from the following passages: <p>Jesus said unto the disciples, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him to the Gentiles: <p>And they ... shall scourge Him, and shall spit upon Him, and shall kill Him: yet the third day He shall rise again. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_33.htm">Mark 10:33-34</a>. <p>So likewise in other places, where He foretells His passion, as <p><a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_18.htm">Matthew 20:18-19</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_8_31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>; Jesus said to the disciples ... Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>. <p>The angel said to the women that came unto the sepulchre, Remember how He spake unto you ... that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and the third day rise again. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_6.htm">Luke 24:6-7</a>. <p>The Lord then called Himself the Son of Man because He suffered Himself to be treated in the same manner as they had treated the Word, as has been shown above in many passages. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Potts translation 1904) 24</h4><p>24. That the Lord is called "the Son of man" when His passion is treated of, is evident from these passages: <p>Jesus said to His disciples, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him to the nations, and they shall scourge Him, and spit on Him, and shall kill Him; but on the third day He shall rise again (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_10_33.htm">Mark 10:33-34</a>). (And so in other places where He foretells His passion, as in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_20_18.htm">Matthew 20:18-19</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/mark_8_31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_9_22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>.) <p>Jesus said to His disciples, Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_26_45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>). <p>The angel said to the women that came to the sepulcher, Remember how He spake unto you, that the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_24_6.htm">Luke 24:6-7</a>). <p>The reason the Lord then called Himself "the Son of man," is that He suffered Himself to be treated in the same way as they had treated the Word, as has been shown above very fully. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 24 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>24. Quod Dominus dicatur "Filius hominis" cum agitur de Passione, constat ex his:- <p>Jesus dixit ad discipulos, "Ecce ascendimus Hierosolymam, et Filius hominis tradetur principibus sacerdotum et scribis, qui condemnabunt Ipsum mortis, et tradent Ipsum gentibus et flagellabunt Ipsum, et exspuent in Ipsum, et occident Ipsum; tertia tamen die resurget" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_10_33-34">Marcum 10:33-34</a>): similiter alibi, ubi praedicit passionem suam (ut, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_20_18-19">Matthaeum 20:18-19</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_mark_8_31">Marcus 8:31</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_9_22">Lucam 9:22</a>). <p>Jesus dixit ad discipulos, "Ecce adest hora, et Filius hominis tradetur in manus peccatorum" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_matthew_26_45">Matthaeum 26:45</a>). <p>Angelus dixit ad mulieres venientes ad monumentum, "Mementote quod locutus est vobis quod oporteat Filium hominis prodi in manus hominum peccatorum, et crucifigi, et tertia die resurgere" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_24_6">Lucam 24:6</a>(, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_24/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_luke_24_7">7</a>)). <p>Quod Dominus tunc Se vocaverit Filium hominis, est quia passus est Sibi fieri similiter, quemadmodum illi fecerunt cum Verbo, ut multis supra ostensum est. </p>
