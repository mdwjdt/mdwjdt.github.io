<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 6</h4><p>6. Here I may add some passages that speak openly of the Lord’s Coming, as follows:<p>The Lord himself is giving you a sign. Behold, a virgin will conceive and bear a son, and she will call his name “God with us.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_7_14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_1_22.htm">Matthew 1:22-23</a>)<p>A Child has been born to us; a Son has been given to us. Leadership will be upon his shoulder; and his name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. There will be no end of the increase of his leadership and peace, upon the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it in judgment and in justice from now on, even to eternity. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_9_6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>)<p>A shoot will go forth from the trunk of Jesse, and a sprout from its roots will bear fruit. The spirit of Jehovah will rest upon him, a spirit of wisdom and intelligence, a spirit of counsel and strength. Justice will be a belt around his waist and truth a belt around his hips. Therefore it will happen on that day that the nations will seek the root of Jesse, the one who stands as a sign for the peoples, and glory will be his rest. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_1.htm">Isaiah 11:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_11_10.htm">10</a>)<p>Send the Lamb of the ruler of the earth from the rock by the wilderness to the mountain of the daughter of Zion. The throne has been established through mercy; he sits upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging and seeking a judgment, and hastening justice. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_16_1.htm">Isaiah 16:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_16_5.htm">5</a>)<p>It will be said on that day, “Behold, this is our God; we have waited for him to set us free. This is Jehovah; we have waited for him. Let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_25_9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>)<p>A voice of someone in the wilderness crying out, “Prepare a pathway for Jehovah; make level in the desert a highway for our God. The glory of Jehovah will be revealed, and all flesh will see it together.” Behold, the Lord Jehovih is coming in strength, and his arm will rule for him. Behold, his reward is with him. Like a shepherd he will feed his flock. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_40_10.htm">10-11</a>)<p>My chosen one, in whom my soul has pleasure: I, Jehovah, have called you in righteousness. I will make you a covenant for the people, a light for the nations, to open blind eyes, and to lead the captives out of prison and those who are sitting in darkness out of the house of confinement. I am Jehovah. This is my name; I will not give my glory to another. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_42_6.htm">6-8</a>)<p>Who has believed our word and to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed? He has no form: we have seen him, but he has no beauty. He bore our diseases and carried our sorrows. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_53_1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a>)<p>“Who is this who is coming from Edom, with spattered garments from Bozrah, approaching in the immensity of his strength?” “I who speak justice and have the power to save, because the day of vengeance is in my heart and the year of my redeemed has arrived.” Therefore he became their Savior. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_63_1.htm">Isaiah 63:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_63_4.htm">4</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_63_8.htm">8</a>)<p>Behold, the days are coming in which I will raise up for David a righteous branch who will rule as king, and prosper, and bring about judgment and justice on earth.

(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_9_9.htm">Zechariah 9:9-10</a>)<p>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Zion! Behold, I am coming to dwell in your midst. Then many nations will be joined to Jehovah on that day and will become my people. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_2_10.htm">Zechariah 2:10-11</a>)<p>As for you, Bethlehem Ephrata, as little as you are among the thousands of Judah, one will come forth from you for me who will become the ruler in Israel; his coming forth is from ancient times, from the days of eternity. He will stand firm and feed [his flock] in the strength of Jehovah. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_5_2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/micah_5_4.htm">4</a>)<p>Behold, I am sending my angel, who will prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to his Temple, the angel of the covenant whom you desire. Behold, he is coming. But who can bear the day of his coming? Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrifying day of Jehovah comes. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/malachi_3_1.htm">Malachi 3:1-2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/malachi_4_5.htm">4:5</a>)<p>I was watching, and behold, someone like the Son of Humanity was coming with the clouds of the heavens. To him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom; and all peoples, nations, and tongues will worship him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, one that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will not perish. All dominions will worship and obey him. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_27.htm">27</a>)<p>Seventy weeks have been allotted for your people and your holy city to put an end to sinning, to seal the vision and the prophet, and to anoint the Most Holy. Know then and understand: from [the time] the word goes forth that Jerusalem must be restored and built until [the time of] Messiah the Leader will be seven weeks. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_24.htm">Daniel 9:24-25</a>)<p>I will place his hand on the sea and his right hand on the rivers. He will cry out to me, “You are my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation.” I will also make him the firstborn, high above the monarchs of the earth. I will make his seed endure to eternity and his throne as the days of the heavens.

You are a priest forever after the manner of Melchizedek.” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_110_1.htm">Psalms 110:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_110_4.htm">4</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/matthew_22_44.htm">Matthew 22:44</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/luke_20_42.htm">Luke 20:42-43</a>)<p>“I have anointed [him as] my king over Zion, which is my holy mountain.” “I will proclaim concerning the statute, ‘Jehovah has said to me, “You are my Son; today I have begotten you. I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.”’” Kiss the Son or he will become angry and you will perish on the way. Blessed are all who trust in him. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_2_6.htm">Psalms 2:6-8</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_2_12.htm">12</a>)<p>You have indeed made him lack little in comparison with angels, and have crowned him with glory and honor.

(<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/psalms_8_5.htm">Psalms 8:5-6</a>)<p>O Jehovah, be mindful of David, who swore to Jehovah, who vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob, “[God forbid] that I enter the tent of my home, go up to my bed, and grant sleep to my eyes, until I have found a place for Jehovah, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob. Behold, we have heard of him in Ephrata; we have found him in the fields of the forest. We will enter his dwelling and bow down at the stool for his feet.
