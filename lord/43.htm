<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 43</h4><p>43. We can see from the following passages that the Lord is called “David.”<p>On that day they will serve Jehovah their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_30_9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a>)<p>Then the children of Israel will turn back and seek Jehovah their God and David their king; with fear they will come to Jehovah and his goodness at the very last of days. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_3_5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>)<p>I will raise up one shepherd over them, who will feed them: my servant David. He will feed them and be their shepherd. I, Jehovah, will be their God, and David will be the leader in their midst. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23-24</a>)<p>So that they become my people, and I become their God, my servant David will be king over them; there will be one shepherd for them all. Then they will dwell in the land, they and their children and their children’s children forever, and David will be their leader forever. And I will make a covenant of peace with them, and it will be an everlasting covenant with them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_23.htm">Ezekiel 37:23-26</a>)<p>I will make an everlasting covenant with you, the sure mercies of David. Behold, I have made him a witness to the peoples, a prince and a lawmaker to the nations. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_55_3.htm">Isaiah 55:3-4</a>)<p>On that day I will raise up the fallen tent of David and patch its holes; I will restore its ruins and build it as it was in ancient days. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_9_11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>)<p>The house of David will be like God, like the angel of Jehovah before them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_12_8.htm">Zechariah 12:8</a>)<p>On that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David.

<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 43</h4><p>43. The Lord is called David. This is apparent from the following:<p>...in that day...they shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up for them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/jeremiah_30_8.htm">Jeremiah 30:8-9</a>)<p>Afterward the children of Israel shall return and seek Jehovah their God and David their king, and they shall come with reverence to Jehovah and to His goodness at the end of days. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/hosea_3_5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>)<p>I will raise up one shepherd over them, and he shall give them pasture — My servant David. He shall give them pasture and become their shepherd. And I, Jehovah, will become their God, and...David a prince among them. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_34_23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23-24</a>)<p>...that they may become My people, and I become their God. David My servant shall be king over them, that they may all have one shepherd.... Then they shall dwell upon the land..., they, their children, and their children’s children, even to eternity; and...David shall be their prince to eternity. Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them, and it shall be an everlasting covenant.... (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_37_23.htm">Ezekiel 37:23-26</a>)<p>I will make an everlasting covenant with you — the sure mercies of David. Indeed I have given him as a witness to the people, a prince and a lawgiver for the nations. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/isaiah_55_3.htm">Isaiah 55:3-4</a>)<p>On that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down, and close up its fractures; I will restore its ruins, and rebuild it as in the days of old. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/amos_9_11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>)<p>...the house of David shall be like God, like an angel of Jehovah before them.
