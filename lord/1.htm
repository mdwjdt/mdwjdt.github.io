<h4 align="center"></h4><h4 align="center">一、整部圣经论述主；主是圣言</h4><p>L1.我们在约翰福音中读到：</p><p>太初有圣言，圣言与神同在，圣言就是神。这圣言太初与神同在。万物是藉着祂造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的。生命在祂里头，这生命就是人的光。光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不领会光。（约翰福音1:1-5）</p><p></p><p>圣言成了肉身，住在我们中间，我们也见过祂的荣耀，正是父独生子的荣耀，充满了恩典和真理。（约翰福音1:14）</p><p></p><p>光来到世界，世人因自己的行为是恶的，不爱光倒爱黑暗。（约翰福音3:19）</p><p></p><p>你们应当趁着有光，信从这光，使你们成为光明之子。我作为光到世界上来，叫凡信我的，不住在黑暗里。（约翰福音12:36，46）</p><p>从这些经文明显看出，主就是永恒之神，这神自己就是那生在世上的主。因为经上说，圣言与神同在，圣言就是神；还说，凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的；又说，圣言成了肉身，他们见过祂。在教会，很少有人明白为何主被称为圣言。然而，祂被称为圣言，是因为“圣言”表示神性真理或神性智慧，主就是神性真理本身或神性智慧本身。这就是为何祂被称为光，论到这光，经上也说，它来到世界。由于神性智慧和神性之爱构成一体，并且来自永恒的那一位在主里面，故经上说“生命在祂里头，这生命就是人的光”。“生命”是指神性之爱，“光”是指神性智慧。“这圣言太初与神同在，圣言就是神”所表示的，就是这一位。“与神同在”表示在神里面，因为智慧在爱里面，爱在智慧里面。在约翰福音的另一处也是如此：</p><p>父啊，现在求你用你自己的自我，用未有世界以先，我与你同享的荣耀荣耀我。（约翰福音17:5）</p><p>“用你自己的自我”表示在你自己里面；因此，经上还说“神就是圣言”；在别处说，主在父里面，父在祂里面；祂与父为一。由于圣言就是神性之爱的神性智慧，故可推知，它就是耶和华自己，因而是主，凡被造的，都是藉着祂造的；因为一切事物都是由神性之爱通过神性智慧被造的。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 1</h4><p>1. Teachings for the New Jerusalem on the Lord <p>The Entire Sacred Scripture Is about the Lord, and the Lord Is the Word<p>WE read in John,<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and nothing that was made came about without him. In him there was life, and that life was the light for humankind. And the light shines in the darkness, but the darkness did not grasp it. And the Word became flesh and lived among us; and we saw his glory, glory like that of the only-begotten child of the Father. He was full of grace and truth. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_5.htm">5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>)<p>In the same Gospel,<p>Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_19.htm">John 3:19</a>)<p>And elsewhere in the same Gospel,<p>While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of the light. I have come into the world as a light so that anyone who believes in me will not remain in darkness. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>)<p>We can see from this that the Lord is God from eternity and that he himself is that Lord who was born into the world. It actually says that the Word was with God and that the Word was God, as well as that nothing that was made came about without him, and then that the Word became flesh and that they saw him.<p>There is little understanding in the church of what it means to call the Lord “the Word.” He is called the Word because the Word means divine truth or divine wisdom and the Lord is divine truth itself or divine wisdom itself. That is why he is also called the light that is said to have come into the world.<p>Since divine wisdom and divine love are one with each other and have been one in the Lord from eternity, it also says “in him there was life, and that life was the light for humankind.” The life is divine love, and the light is divine wisdom.<p>This oneness is what is meant by saying both that “in the beginning the Word was with God” and that “the Word was God.” “With God” is in God, since wisdom is in love and love is in wisdom. This is like the statement elsewhere in John, “Glorify me, Father, together with yourself, with the glory I had with you before the world existed” (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_5.htm">John 17:5</a>). “With yourself” is “in yourself.” This is why it adds “and the Word was God.” It says elsewhere that the Lord is in the Father and the Father is in him [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_14_10.htm">John 14:10</a>], and that the Father and he are one [<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_10_30.htm">John 10:30</a>].<p>Since the Word is the divine wisdom of the divine love, it follows that it is Jehovah himself and therefore the Lord, the one by whom all things were made that were made, since everything was created out of divine love by means of divine wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 1</h4><p>1. The Holy Scripture Throughout Has the Lord As Its Subject, and the Lord Embodies the Word<p>We read in John:<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. This was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of people. And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.... And the Word moreover became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as though of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>)<p>Again in the same Gospel:<p>...the light came into the world, but people loved darkness more than light, for their deeds were evil. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_19.htm">John 3:19</a>)<p>And elsewhere in it:<p>While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be children of light.... I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in Me should not abide in darkness. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>)<p>It is apparent from this that the Lord is, from eternity, God, and that God Himself is the Lord who was born in the world. For we are told that the Word was with God, and that the Word was God. Also that without Him nothing was made that was made. And later we are told that the Word became flesh, and people beheld Him.</p><p>[2] Why the Lord is called the Word is little understood in the church. However, He is called the Word because the term “Word” symbolizes Divine truth itself or Divine wisdom itself, and the Lord embodies Divine truth itself or Divine wisdom itself. That, too, is why He is called the light, which is also said to have come into the world.<p>Because Divine wisdom and Divine love are united, and were united in the Lord from eternity, therefore we are told as well that “In Him was life, and the life was the light of people.” Life means Divine love, and light Divine wisdom.<p>This is the union meant by the statement that the Word was in the beginning with God and that God was the Word. With God means in God, for wisdom is present in love, and love in wisdom.<p>So, too, we find elsewhere in John:<p>...Father, glorify Me with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_5.htm">John 17:5</a>)<p>“With Yourself” means in Yourself. That, too, is why we are told, “And God was the Word.” And elsewhere that the Lord is in the Father, and the Father in Him, and that He and the Father are one.<p>Now because the Word is the Divine wisdom accompanying Divine love, it follows that it is Jehovah Himself, thus the Lord, by whom all things were made that were made, inasmuch as they were all created out of Divine love by means of Divine wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Dick translation 1954) 1</h4><p>1. I. The Whole Sacred Scripture treats of the Lord; and the Lord is the Word <p>We read in John: <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. This was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men: and the light shineth in darkness, but the darkness comprehended it not. <p>Further, <p>The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_14.htm">14</a>. <p>In the same, <p>Light is come into the world, but men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_19.htm">John 3:19</a>; and elsewhere in the same, <p>While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.... I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>. <p>From these passages it is evident that the Lord is God from eternity, and that God Himself is the Lord who was born in the world. For it is said that the Word was with God, and that the Word was God; also that without Him nothing was made that was made; and again, that the Word became flesh.... and they beheld Him. <p>Why the Lord is called the Word, is but little understood in the Church. He is, however, called the Word because the Word signifies Divine Truth or Divine Wisdom; and the Lord is Divine Truth itself or Divine Wisdom itself. For this reason He is also called the Light, which likewise is said to have come into the world. Since Divine Wisdom and Divine Love make one, and in the Lord had been one from eternity, it is therefore also said, "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men": the life is Divine Love, and the light is Divine Wisdom. This oneness is what is meant by the statement that in the beginning the Word was with God, and that the Word was God. With God means in God, for wisdom is in love, and love in wisdom. So also in another place in John: <p>And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_5.htm">John 17:5</a>. <p>With thine own self means, in thyself. Therefore it is also said, <p>"and the Word was God;" and elsewhere, that the Lord is in the Father, and the Father in Him; and also that the Father and He are one. <p>Now, as the Word is the Divine Wisdom of the Divine Love, it follows that it is Jehovah Himself, and thus the Lord, by whom all things were made that are made; for all things were created from the Divine Love by means of the Divine Wisdom. </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Potts translation 1904) 1</h4><p>1. UNIVERSAL HOLY SCRIPTURE TREATS OF THE LORD: THE LORD IS THE WORD. <p>We read in John: <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_1.htm">John 1:1-5</a>). <p>The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_1_14.htm">John 1:14</a>). <p>The light is come into the world and men loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_3_19.htm">John 3:19</a>). <p>While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may be sons of light. I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth in Me should not abide in the darkness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_36.htm">John 12:36</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_12_46.htm">46</a>). <p>From these passages it is evident that the Lord is God from eternity, and that this God is the selfsame Lord who was born in the world; for it is said that the Word was with God, and God was the Word, and also that without Him was not anything made that was made; and it is added that the Word was made flesh, and they beheld Him. <p>It is but little understood in the church why the Lord is called the Word. It is because "the Word" signifies Divine truth or Divine wisdom, and the Lord is Divine truth itself or Divine wisdom itself. And this is why He is called the Light, of which also it is said that it came into the world. As the Divine wisdom and the Divine love make a one, <sup>1</sup>and in the Lord had been a one from eternity, it is said, "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men." "Life" is Divine love; and "light" is Divine wisdom. It is this one that is meant by, "In the beginning the Word was with God, and God was the Word." "With God," is in God; for wisdom is in love, and love in wisdom. So in another place in John: <p>And now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own Self, with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/john_17_5.htm">John 17:5</a>). "With Thine own Self," is in Thyself, and therefore it is said, "and God was the Word;" and elsewhere, that the Lord is in the Father, and the Father in Him; and that He and the Father are one. As therefore the Word is the Divine wisdom of the Divine love, it follows that it is Jehovah Himself, thus the Lord by whom all things were made that are made; for all things have been created from Divine love by means of Divine wisdom. <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><p>1.&nbsp;That is, a complex whole which constitutes a unity.

<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 1 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>1. (I.) QUOD UNIVERSA SCRIPTURA SACRA SIT DE DOMINO; ET QUOD DOMINUS SIT VERBUM. <p>Legitur apud Johannem, <p>"In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum: hoc erat in principio apud Deum. Omnia per Ipsum facta sunt, et sine Ipso factum est nihil quod factum est. In Ipso vita erat, et vita erat lux hominum: et lux in tenebris apparet, sed tenebrae illam non comprehenderunt... Ceterum Verbum Caro factum est, et habitavit inter nos, et vidimus gloriam Ipsius, gloriam sicut Unigeniti a Patre; plenus gratia et veritate (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_1/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_1-5">1:1-5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_1/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_1_14">14</a>). <p>Apud eundem, <p>"Lux venit in mundum, sed dilexerunt homines magis tenebras quam lucem; erant enim opera eorum mala" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_1/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_3_19">3:19</a>). <p>Et alibi apud eundem, <p>"Quousque lucem habetis, credite in lucem, ut filii lucis sitis. ...Ego Lux in mundum veni, ut omnis qui credit in Me, in tenebris non maneat" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_1/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_36">12:36</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_1/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_12_46">46</a>). <p>Ex his patet quod Dominus sit ab aeterno Deus, et quod Ipse ille Dominus sit, qui natus est in mundo; dicitur enim, "Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum;" tum, "sine Ipso factum est nihil quod factum est:" et postea, quod "Verbum Caro factum sit," et viderint Ipsum. Quod Dominus dicatur Verbum, parum in ecclesia intelligitur; sed dicitur Verbum, quia "Verbum" significat Divinum Verum seu Divinam Sapientiam, et Dominus est ipsum Divinum Verum seu ipsa Divina Sapientia; quare etiam vocatur Lux, de qua etiam dicitur quod "in mundum venerit." Quia Divina Sapientia et Divinus Amor unum faciunt, et in Domino unum ab aeterno fuerant, ideo etiam dicitur, "In Ipso vita erat, et vita erat lux hominum;" "vita" est Divinus Amor, et "lux" est Divina Sapientia. Hoc unum est, quod intelligitur per quod "in principio esset Verbum apud Deum," et quod "Deus esset Verbum;" "apud Deum" est in Deo, nam sapientia est in amore, et amor in sapientia: similiter alibi apud Johannem, <p>"Glorifica Me, Tu Pater, apud Te Ipsum, gloria quam habui, antequam mundus esset, apud Te" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_1/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_john_17_5">17:5</a>); <p>"apud Te Ipsum" est in Te Ipso; quare etiam dicitur, "Et Deus erat Verbum;" et alibi, quod Dominus sit in Patre et Pater in Ipso, tum quod Pater et Ipse unum sint. Nunc quia Verbum est Divina Sapientia Divini Amoris, sequitur quod sit Ipse Jehovah, ita Dominus, a quo omnia facta sunt quae facta; nam ex Divino Amore per Divinam Sapientiam omnia creata sunt. </p>
