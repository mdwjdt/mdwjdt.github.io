<h4 align="center"></h4><p>L52.⑹通过众先知说圣言的耶和华自己，也就是主。关于众先知，我们读到，他们在异象中，耶和华和他们说话。当在异象中时，他们不是在肉身中，而是在灵里；在这种状态下，他们看见诸如在天堂里的那类事物。然而，当耶和华和他们说话时，他们是在肉身中，并听见祂说话。</p><p>先知的这两种状态要仔细加以区分。在异象的状态下，他们的灵眼是打开的，而肉眼是关闭的。这时，他们觉得自己似乎从一个地方被带到了另一个地方，而肉身仍留在原处。以西结、撒迦利亚，但以理和写启示录时的约翰，有时就处于这种状态；那时经上说他们在异象中或在灵里。因此，以西结说：</p><p>灵将我举起，在神异象中借着神的灵，将我带进迦勒底地，到被掳的人那里；我所见的异象就离我上升去了。（以西结书11:1，24）</p><p>他还说：</p><p>灵将他举起，他就听见在他身后有震动和其它东西。（以西结书3:12，14）</p><p></p><p>灵就将他举到天地之间，在神的异象中，带他到耶路撒冷，他看见可憎的事。（以西结书8:3）</p><p>同样是在神的异象中，或在灵里，他看见四活物，就是基路伯（以西结书1:5；10:1-15）；还看见新地和新殿，以及一位量它们的天使（以西结书40:1-5；48:1-35）；他说，那时他在神的异象中（以西结书40:2）；灵将他举起（以西结书43:5）。撒迦利亚的情况也是这样，当时他由一位天使陪伴，看见：</p><p>一个人骑着马，在番石榴树中间。（撒迦利亚书1:8）</p><p>四角，后来看见一人手拿准绳。（撒迦利亚书1:18；2:1）</p><p>大祭司约书亚。（撒迦利亚书3:1）</p><p>一个灯台和两棵橄榄树。（撒迦利亚书4:2，3）</p><p>一卷飞行的书卷和一个量器。（撒迦利亚书5:1，6）</p><p>四辆战车从两座山中间出来，以及马。（撒迦利亚书6:1）</p><p>但以理处于同样的状态下，那时，他看见：</p><p>四个兽从海中上来。（但以理书7:3）</p><p>公绵羊与公山羊之间的战斗。（但以理书8:1）</p><p>他在异象中看见这些事物 （但以理书7:1，2，7，13；8:2；10:1，7，8）；他在异象中看见天使加百列并和他说话（但以理书9:21，22）。约翰写启示录时，同样的情形发生在他身上，他说：</p><p>主日，他在灵里。（启示录1:10）</p><p>他在灵里被带到旷野。（启示录17:3）</p><p>在灵里被带到一座高山上。（启示录21:10）</p><p>他在异象中看见马。（启示录9:17）</p><p>他在别处说，他看见他所描述的事物，因而在灵里或异象中（启示录1:12；4:1；5:1；6:1）。</p>

<h4 align="center">The Lord (Dole translation 2014) 52</h4><p>52. 6. Jehovah himself - that is, the Lord - spoke the Word through prophets.<p>We read of the prophets that they had visions and that Jehovah talked with them. When they had visions, they were not focused on their bodies but on the spirit, in which state they saw things of a heavenly nature. When Jehovah talked with them, though, they were conscious of their bodies and heard Jehovah speaking.<p>We need to draw a clear distinction between these two states. In a visionary state, the eyes of their spirit were open and the eyes of their body were closed; and at such times they seemed to themselves to be taken from place to place while their bodies stayed where they were. Ezekiel, Zechariah, and Daniel were in this state at times, and so was John when he wrote the Book of Revelation. They were then said to be in a vision or in the spirit. In fact, Ezekiel says,<p>The spirit lifted me up and brought me back into Chaldea, to the captivity, in a vision from God, in the spirit of God. In this way the vision that I saw came over me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">24</a>)<p>He says that the spirit lifted him up and that he heard an earthquake and other things behind him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_14.htm">14</a>). He also said that the spirit lifted him up between earth and heaven and took him off into Jerusalem in visions from God, and he saw abominations (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a> and following).<p>That is why (again in a vision of God or in the spirit) Ezekiel saw the four beasts that were angel guardians (chapters <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_1.htm">1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10</a>), and he saw a new earth and a new temple with the angel measuring them, as we are told in chapters <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">40</a>-<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">48</a>. He says in chapter <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">40:2</a>, that he was then in visions from God; and in chapter <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_43_5.htm">43:5</a>, he says that the spirit lifted him up at that time.<p>The same thing happened with Zechariah. There was an angel inwardly present with him when he saw a man riding among myrtle trees (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a> and following); when he saw four horns and then a man with a measuring line in his hand (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">2:1</a>); when he saw Joshua the high priest (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_3_1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a> and following); when he saw a lampstand and two olive trees (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_1.htm">Zechariah 4:1</a> and following); when he saw a flying scroll and a measuring basket (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">6</a>); and when he saw four chariots coming from between two mountains, along with horses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a> and following).<p>Daniel was in the same kind of state when he saw four beasts come up from the sea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_3.htm">Daniel 7:3</a>) and when he saw battles between a ram and a goat (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8:1</a> and following).<p>We read in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_10_7.htm">7-8</a> that he saw these things in visions. We read in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a> that he saw the angel Gabriel in a vision and talked with him.<p>Much the same happened with John when he wrote the Book of Revelation. He says that he was in the spirit on the Lord’s day (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>), that he was carried away in the spirit into the wilderness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_3.htm">17:3</a>), to a high mountain in the spirit (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_10.htm">21:10</a>), that he saw horses in a vision (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_17.htm">9:17</a>), and elsewhere that he saw what he described, being therefore in the spirit or in a vision (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_2.htm">1:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_4_1.htm">4:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_1.htm">5:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_1.htm">6:1</a>; and in the particular chapters that follow). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Rogers translation 2014) 52</h4><p>52. Jehovah Himself, that is, the Lord, spoke the Word through the prophets. Regarding the prophets, we read that they were in a state of vision, and that Jehovah spoke with them.<p>When they were in a state of vision, they were not present in their body, but in their spirit, and in that state they saw things of the kind found in heaven. But when Jehovah spoke with them, they were then present in their body and heard Jehovah speaking.<p>These two states experienced by the prophets must be clearly distinguished. In a state of vision the eyes of their spirit were open and the eyes of their body closed; and they then seemed to themselves to be conveyed from place to place, their body not moving from where it was.<p>Ezekiel, Zechariah, and Daniel were at times in this state, and so was John when he was writing the book of Revelation. We are also told then that they were in a state of vision or in the spirit. Ezekiel, indeed, says:<p>The spirit took me up and returned me in a vision (of God) by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to those in captivity. (So) the vision that I had seen went up from me. (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24</a>, cf. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">11:1</a>)<p>He says that the spirit lifted him up, and that he heard behind him an earthquake, and other things (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_14.htm">14</a>). Also that the spirit lifted him up between the earth and heaven, and brought him in the visions of God to Jerusalem, where he saw abominations (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>ff.).<p>It was in a vision of God, or in the spirit, therefore, that he saw four living creatures, which were cherubim (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>,<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10</a>). And also a new earth and a new temple, and an angel measuring them (as described in chapters 40-48). He says that he was then in the visions of God (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>), and that the spirit then lifted him up (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_43_5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>).<p>The same experience befell Zechariah when he saw a man riding among the myrtle trees (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>ff.); when he saw four horns, and then a man with a measuring line in his hand (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">2:1</a>ff.); when he saw Joshua the high priest (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_3_1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>ff.); when he saw a lampstand and two olive trees (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_1.htm">Zechariah 4:1</a>ff.); when he saw a flying scroll and an ephah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">6</a>); and when he saw four chariots coming from between two mountains, and the horses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a>ff.).<p>Daniel was in the same state when he saw four beasts coming up from the sea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_3.htm">Daniel 7:3</a>), and when he saw battles of the ram and the male goat (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8:1</a>ff.). We read that he saw these things in a state of vision (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_13.htm">13</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_10_7.htm">7-8</a>); and that the angel Gabriel appeared to him in a vision and spoke with him (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_21.htm">Daniel 9:21-22</a>).<p>The same experience befell John when he was writing the book of Revelation, who says that he was in the spirit on the Lord’s day (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>); that he was carried away in the spirit into the wilderness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>), and in the spirit onto a high mountain (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>); that in a vision he saw horses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_17.htm">Revelation 9:17</a>). And elsewhere that he saw the things he described, thus seeing them in the spirit or in a vision (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_12.htm">Revelation 1:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_4_1.htm">4:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_1.htm">5:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_1.htm">6:1</a>, and so on in each of the following chapters). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Dick translation 1954) 52</h4><p>52. 6. JEHOVAH HIMSELF, THAT IS, THE LORD, SPOKE THE WORD BY THE PROPHETS. We read of the prophets that they were in vision, and that Jehovah spoke with them. When they were in vision they were not in their body, but in their spirit; and in this state they saw such things as are in heaven. When, however, Jehovah spoke with them, they were in their body, and they heard Him speaking. These two states of the prophets should be clearly distinguished. In the state of vision, the eyes of their spirit were opened, and the eyes of their body closed. Then also they appeared to themselves to be carried from place to place, the body still remaining where it was. In this state at times were Ezekiel, Zechariah, Daniel, and John when he wrote the Revelation; and it is then said that they were in vision, or in the spirit, for Ezekiel says, <p>The spirit lifted me up, and brought me into Chaldea, to them of the captivity, in a vision of God, in the spirit of God. So the vision that I had seen went up over me. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">24</a>. <p>He says too, <p>That the spirit took him up, and he heard behind him an earthquake, and other things. <p>Further, that the spirit lifted him up between the earth and heaven, and brought him in the visions of God to Jerusalem, where he saw abominations. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>, and following verses. <p>He was also in a vision of God, or in the spirit, when he saw <p>Four living creatures, which were cherubs. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a> and <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">Ezekiel 10</a>; <p>Also, a new earth and a new temple, and an angel measuring them; concerning these see chapters 40 to 48. That he was then in the visions of God, he says in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>; and that the spirit then took him up, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_43_5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>. The same happened to Zechariah, and he was then accompanied by an angel, when he saw <p>A man riding among the myrtle trees. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>. <p>Four horns, and afterwards a man in whose hand was a measuring line. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">2:1</a>; Joshua the high priest. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_3_1.htm">3:1</a>, and foll.; <p>A candlestick, and two olive trees. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_2.htm">Zechariah 4:2-3</a><a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">; A flying roll, and an ephah. 5:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">6</a>; And four chariots coming out from between two mountains, and horses. . <p>Daniel was in the same state, when he saw <p>Four beasts coming up from the sea. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_3.htm">Daniel 7:3</a>; And the battle between the ram and the he-goat. <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_1.htm">8:1</a>, and foll. <p>That he saw these things in visions is stated in chapters <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_1.htm">Daniel 7:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_10_7.htm">7-8</a>.

<h4 align="center">Doctrine of the Lord (Potts translation 1904) 52</h4><p>52. vi. Jehovah Himself (that is, the Lord) spoke the Word through the prophets. We read of the prophets that they were in vision, and that Jehovah spoke to them. When they were in vision they were not in the body, but in their spirit, in which state they saw things such as are in heaven. But when Jehovah spoke to them, they were in the body, and heard Him speaking. These two states of the prophets should be carefully distinguished. In their state of vision, the eyes of their spirit were opened, and those of their body shut, and they then seemed to themselves to be carried from place to place, the body remaining in its own place. In this state, at times, were Ezekiel, Zechariah, Daniel, and John when he wrote the Revelation; and it is then said that they were "in vision," or "in the spirit." Thus Ezekiel says: <p>The spirit lifted me up, and brought me into Chaldea to the captivity, in the vision of God, in the Spirit of God; thus went up above me the vision which I saw (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_11_24.htm">11:24</a>). <p>He says too, <p>That the spirit took him up, and he heard behind him an earthquake, and other things (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_3_14.htm">3:14</a>). <p>Also that the spirit lifted him up between the earth and the heaven, and brought him in the visions of God to Jerusalem, and he saw abominations (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_8_3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>, etc.). <p>In like manner in the vision of God, or in the spirit, he saw <p>The four living creatures, which were cherubs (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_1_5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_10_1.htm">10:1-15</a> )<p>And also the new earth and the new temple, and an angel measuring them (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_1.htm">Ezekiel 40:1-5</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_48_1.htm">48:1-35</a> )<p>That he was then in the visions of God, he says in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_40_2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>; and that the spirit took him up, in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/ezekiel_43_5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>. <p>The case was the same with Zechariah, in whom at the time there was an angel, <p>When he saw a man riding among the myrtle trees (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>, etc.). <p>When he saw four horns, and afterwards a man who had a measuring line in his hand (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_1_18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_2_1.htm">2:1</a>). <p>When he saw Joshua the high priest (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_3_1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>, etc.). <p>When he saw a lampstand, and two olive trees (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_4_2.htm">Zechariah 4:2-3</a>). <p>When he saw a flying roll, and an ephah (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_5_6.htm">6</a>). <p>And when he saw four chariots going out between two mountains, and horses (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/zechariah_6_1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a>, etc.). <p>In a similar state was Daniel, <p>When he saw four beasts coming up out of the sea (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_3.htm">Daniel 7:3</a>). <p>And when he saw the combats of the ram and the he-goat (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_1.htm">Daniel 8:1</a>, etc.). <p>That he saw these things in visions is stated in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_1.htm">7:1-2</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_7.htm">7</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_7_13.htm">13</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_8_2.htm">8:2</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_10_1.htm">10:1</a>, <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_10_7.htm">7-8</a>. That the angel Gabriel was seen by him in vision, and spoke with him, is stated in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/daniel_9_21.htm">9:21-22</a>. The case was the same with John when he wrote the Revelation, who says, <p>That he was in the spirit on the Lord's day (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>). <p>That he was carried away in the spirit into the wilderness (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_17_3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>). <p>Into a high mountain in the spirit (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_21_10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>). <p>That he saw horses in vision (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_9_17.htm">Revelation 9:17</a>). <p>And elsewhere that he saw the things which he described, thus in spirit, or in vision (<a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_1_12.htm">Revelation 1:12</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_4_1.htm">4:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_5_1.htm">5:1</a>; <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/3927/revelation_6_1.htm">6:1</a>;). </p>
<h4 align="center">Doctrina Novae Hierosolymae de Domino 52 (original Latin 1763)</h4><p>52. ((vi.)) Quod Ipse Jehovah, hoc est, Dominus, locutus sit Verbum per Prophetas.- De Prophetis legitur, quod fuerint "in visione," et quod "Jehovah locutus sit cum illis." Cum fuerunt in visione, non erant in suo corpore, sed in suo spiritu; in quo statu viderunt talia quae in caelo sunt: cum autem Jehovah locutus est cum illis, tunc in corpore suo fuerunt, et audiverunt Jehovam loquentem. Hi bini status Prophetarum probe distinguendi sunt. In statu visionis aperti sunt oculi spiritus illorum, et clausi oculi corporis illorum, ac tunc etiam sibi visi sunt auferri e loco in locum, corpore manente in suo. In hoc statu fuerunt quandoque Ezechiel, Sacharias, Daniel, et Johannes cum scripsit Apocalypsin: et tunc dicitur quod essent "in visione," aut "in spiritu." Dicit enim Ezechiel, <p>"Spiritus... sustulit me, et reduxit me in Chaldaeam ad captivitatem in visione" Dei, "in spiritu Dei; ita ascendit super me visio, quam vidi" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_52/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_11_1">11:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_52/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_11_24">24</a>). <p>Dicit, <p>Quod sustulerit illum spiritus, et audiverit Post se terrae motum, et alia (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_52/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_3_12">3:12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_52/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_3_14">14</a>); <p>Tum quod sustulerit illum Spiritus inter terram et caelum, et abduxerit in Hierosolymam in visionibus Dei, et viderit abominationes (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_52/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_8_3">8:3</a>, seq.). <p>Quare similiter in visione Dei, seu in spiritu, vidit <p>Quatuor animalia, quae erant cherubi (cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_52/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_1_1-28">1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_52/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_10_1-22">10</a> [NCBSP: <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_52/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_1_5">1:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_52/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_10_1-15">10:1-15</a>]); <p>Tum novam terram et novum templum, et angelum metientem illa (de quibus in cap. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_52/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_40_1-49">40</a> ad <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_52/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_48_1-35">48</a>): <p>Quod tunc fuerit in visionibus Dei, dicit <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_52/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_40_2">40:2</a>; et quod tunc sustulerit illum Spiritus, (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_52/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_43_5">43:5</a>). <p>Simile factum est cum Sacharia, in quo tunc angelus fuit, <p>Cum vidit virum equitantem inter myrtos (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_52/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_zechariah_1_8">Sacharias 1:8</a>, seq.); <p>Cum vidit quatuor cornua, et dein virum, in cujus manu funiculus mensurae (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_52/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_2_1">2:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_doctrina-novae-hierosolymae-de-domino_52/bible_latin-vulgata-clementina_ezekiel_2_5">5</a>, seq.
