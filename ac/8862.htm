<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8862节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8862.</strong>“神所说的话”之所以表示为天上和地上之人的神之真理，是因为十条诫或十诫，以及随后从西乃山上所颁布和命令的律例，是诸如不仅为了地上的人，还为了天上的人的那类真理。一切话，也就是来自主的一切真理不只是为了世人，同时还为了天使，因为它们穿过天堂，由此传到地上。但它们在天上听上去不像在地上，因为在那里，它们以属灵的形式存在，而在地上，则以属世的形式存在。至于那些处于属灵形式的事物与那些处于属世形式的事物相比，其性质如何，这从圣言的一切细节，无论内在意义上的还是外在意义上的，明显看出来。内在意义上的事物是属灵的，但外在意义，也就是字义上的事物是属世的。后者适合世人，而前者适合天上的天使。<br />这一真相从以下事实可以看出来：神性本身所差遣的圣言从祂经由天堂传到地上。当它抵达地上时，就是适合人类的真理，人类活在尘世和肉体事物当中。而在天上，它适合天使，天使活在属灵和属天事物当中。圣言因具有这样的性质，故本身是神圣的；因为它包含属天堂和神性之物在里面。这一真相从十诫很清楚地看出来。谁都能看出，这些诫命是地上众所周知的那类律法；如当尊敬父母，不可杀人、奸淫、偷盗，不可作谎言的见证人。因此，以色列民族仅凭属世之光可能早就知道这些律法；因为有哪个民族不知道它们呢？然而，耶和华却亲自降临来宣布它们，并且是从直烧到天心的火中宣布它们。由此可见，这些诫命包含在自己里面的事物要多于显现在文字上的；也就是说，它们包含诸如同时为了天堂并充满天堂的那类真理。圣言里的一切事物都具有这种性质，因为它们来自神性。这一切表明为何圣言是神圣的，以及当如何理解圣言的一点一画，甚至每个小角都是受启示的（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.18.htm">5:18</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.17.htm">16:17</a>）。因此，十诫在灵义上的性质，也就是它们在天上的性质可见于下文。</p>

That by "the words which God spake" are meant truths Divine for those in the heavens and those on the earth, is because the ten commandments, which are called the Decalogue, and the subsequent statutes 
promulgated and commanded from Mount Sinai, are such truths as are not only for those who are on the earth, but also for those who are in the heavens; for all the words, that is, all the truths which 
are from the Lord, are not only for men, but are also at the same time for the angels, since they come through heaven and thus pass over to earth. But in the heavens they do not sound as they do on 
the earth, for in the heavens they are in a spiritual form, but on the earth in a natural form. What is the nature of those things which are in a spiritual form as compared with those which are in a 
natural form, is evident from all the particulars of the Word in the internal sense and in the external sense. Those in the internal sense are spiritual, but those in the external sense, which is the 
sense of the letter, are natural. The latter have been accommodated to men on the earth, but the former to angels in the heavens. [2] That such is the case can be seen from the fact that the Word has 
been sent, and thus has passed, from the Divine Itself through heaven to earth; and that when it comes to the earth it is truth accommodated to the human race, which is in earthly and bodily things; 
whereas in the heavens it is accommodated to angels, who are in spiritual and heavenly things. Such being the nature of the Word, it is holy in itself; for it contains in itself what is heavenly and Divine. 
This can be plainly seen from the ten commandments of the Decalogue. Everyone can see that these commandments are such things as have been known everywhere on the earth; as that parents are to 
be honored, that murder, adultery, and theft are not to be committed, and that no one should bear false witness; consequently that the Israelitish nation might have known these laws from natural light 
alone; for what nation is there which does not know them? And yet for their promulgation Jehovah Himself came down and promulgated them out of fire which burned even to the heart of heaven. From this 
it can be seen that these commandments contain in their bosom more things than appear in the letter, namely, such things as are at the same time for the heavens and that fill the heavens. All things 
of the Word are of this nature, because they are from the Divine. From this it is plain whence it is that the Word is holy, and what is meant by the Word's being inspired as to every jot and tittle, and 
as to every little horn (Matt. 5:18; Luke 16:17). The nature of the commandments of the Decalogue in the spiritual sense, that is, their nature in the heavens, shall accordingly be seen in what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8862</b></p><p><b>8862.</b>
The reason why 'the words which God spoke' means God's truths for those in heaven and for those on earth is that the Ten Commandments or Decalogue, and then the statutes, declared and commanded from 
Mount Sinai, are truths such as are intended not only for those who are on earth but also for those who are in heaven. All the words, that is, all the truths that come from the Lord are not merely for 
people in the world but also at the same time for angels; for they pass through heaven and thereby to earth. But they do not sound the same in heaven as they do on earth, because there they exist in 
a spiritual form, whereas on earth they exist in natural form. What they are like in their spiritual form compared with what they are in their natural form is clear from the internal sense and the external 
sense of the particular things in the Word. In the internal sense they are spiritual matters, but in the external sense, which is the sense of the letter, they are natural ones. The latter have 
been made suitable for those on earth, but the former for those in heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The truth of this may be seen from the consideration that the Word, sent by the Divine Himself, has passed from Him through 
heaven to earth. When it reaches earth it is truth made suitable for the human race, which lives amid earthly and bodily things. But as it exists in heaven it is made suitable for angels, who live 
amid spiritual and celestial things. Because it is like this the Word is in itself holy; for it contains what is heavenly and Divine within it. This is perfectly clear from the Ten Commandments. Anyone 
can see that those commandments are the kind of laws that are well known everywhere on earth - that one should honour parents, that one should not kill, commit adultery, or steal, and that people 
should not answer as false witnesses. Consequently the Israelite nation could have known these laws from natural enlightenment alone; for is there any nation that does not know them? And yet Jehovah 
Himself came down to declare them; and He declared them out of fire that was burning 'even to the heart of heaven'.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> From this it becomes clear that those commandments contain more within them than is 
apparent in the letter; that is to say, they contain truths such as are intended at the same time for heaven and which fill heaven. Everything in the Word is like this since it comes from the Divine. 
All this shows why the Word is holy and what should be understood by statements about the inspiration of the Word even to every jot and tattle, and to every small part of a letter, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:18</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2016:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 16:17</a>. 
The nature therefore of the Ten Commandments in the spiritual sense, that is, as they exist in heaven, will be seen in what is to follow.

Quod per `verba quae locutus est Deus' intelligantur vera Divina illis in caelis et illis in terris, est quia decem praecepta, quae decalogus vocantur, et dein statuta, promulgata et mandata e monte 
Sinai, sunt talia vera quae non solum pro illis sunt qui in terris sed etiam pro illis qui in caelis; nam omnia verba, hoc est, omnia vera quae a Domino, non modo sunt pro hominibus sed etiam simul pro 
angelis, nam pervadunt caelum et sic transeunt ad terram; at in caelis non sonant sicut in terris, sunt enim ibi in forma spirituali, in terris autem in forma naturali; qualia sunt illa quae in forma 
spirituali respective ad illa quae in forma naturali, constat ex singulis Verbi in sensu interno et in sensu externo; illa in sensu interno sunt spiritualia at illa in sensu externo, qui est sensus 
litterae, sunt naturalia; haec accommodata sunt illis {1} in terris, illa autem iis {1} in caelis. 	[2] Quod ita sit, videri potest ex eo quod Verbum missum sit ac ita transiverit ab Ipso Divino per 
caelum ad terram; et cum venit ad terram, (o)quod sit verum accommodatum generi humano, quod in terrenis et corporeis est; at quod in caelis accommodatum sit angelis, qui in spiritualibus et caelestibus 
sunt; quia {2} Verbum tale est, {3} in se est sanctum, nam continet in se caeleste et Divinum.  Hoc constare potest manifeste a decem praeceptis decalogi; quisque potest scire quod praecepta illa 
talia sint, quae nota fuerunt {4} ubivis in terris, sicut quod honorandi parentes, quod non occidendum, non adulterandum, non furandum, quod non responsuri {5} testes falsi; consequenter quod gens Israelitica 
illa {6} ex solo lumine naturali potuisset scire, nam quaenam gens est quae non illa scit; et tamen ad illa promulganda Ipse Jehovah descendit et promulgavit illa ex igne qui flagrabat usque 
ad cor caeli; inde constare potest quod praecepta illa plura in sinu contineant quam quae apparent in littera, quod nempe talia quae simul pro caelis sunt, et quae implent caelos; omnia Verbi sunt talia 
quia a Divino; inde patet unde est quod Verbum sit sanctum, et quid intelligitur per quod Verbum sit inspiratum {7} quoad omnem iotam (o)et apicem, et quoad unumquodvis corniculum, Matth. v 18; Luc. 
xvi (x)17.  Qualia itaque sunt praecepta decalogi in sensu spirituali, hoc est, qualia sunt in caelis, videbitur in sequentibus. @1 i qui$  @2 cum$ @3 i tunc$ @4 sunt$ @5 non erunt in$ @6 talia$ @7
