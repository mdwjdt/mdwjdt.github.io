<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7568节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7568.</strong>“你向天伸手”表注意力被引向天堂，那时天堂将更加靠近。这从“伸手”和“天”的含义清楚可知：“伸手”是指将注意力引向某种事物，因为伸手会将注意力引向某种事物，并将该事物指明出来；“天”是指天使天堂。由于当人的注意力被引向天堂，并且天堂被指给他看时，他也将目光和思维转向那里，故由此也表示靠近。因为在灵界，一切靠近都是通过思维的集中实现的。诚然，前面（<a href="7519.htm">7519</a>节）已经讨论了这些事的性质，但由于它们都是诸如不为世人所知的那类事，所以需要对它们稍作进一步的说明。当有状态的变化需要发生在即将经历荒凉的恶人身上时，如发生在目前这几章所描述的那些人身上的情形，这种变化通过来自天堂的更直接的良善和真理的流注实现。因为天堂离他们越近，在他们身上所激活的邪恶和虚假就越内在。来自天堂的良善和真理向内层渗透；它们越深入渗透，天堂就越近。这解释了为何来自地狱的人不敢靠近任何天堂社群，而是尽可能地远离（参看<a href="4225.htm">4225</a>，<a href="4226.htm">4226</a>，<a href="4299.htm">4299</a>，<a href="4533.htm">4533</a>，<a href="4674.htm">4674</a>，<a href="5057.htm">5057</a>，<a href="5058.htm">5058</a>，<a href="7519.htm">7519</a>节）。由此可见当如何理解“摩西向天伸手”所表示的“注意力被引向天堂，那时天堂将更加靠近”这句话。现在描述的是一个新状态，就是邪恶所生的虚假摧毁与那些进行侵扰之人同在的教会的一切良善和真理所处的状态。由于这种状态通过来自神的更直接的真理流注，同时通过天堂的更加靠近而产生，所以摩西被吩咐“向天伸手”。</p>

Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven. That this signifies attention, and the approach of heaven, is evident from the signification of "stretching forth the hand," as being to cause to pay attention, 
for by the stretching forth of the hand, something has the attention directed to it and is shown; and from the signification of "heaven," as being the angelic heaven; and as when anyone has his attention 
directed to heaven, and it is shown to him, he also directs his sight and thought thither, from this there is also signified approach, for all approach in the spiritual world is effected by the determination 
of the thought. How the case herein is has indeed been told above (n. 7519), but as these things are such as have been unknown in the world, they may be illustrated a little further. When 
any change of state is to be effected with the evil who are to be vastated, as with those described in these chapters, this change is effected by a more present influx of good and truth from heaven, because 
the nearer heaven comes to them, the more the interior evils and falsities with them are excited; for good and truth from heaven penetrate toward the interiors, and the more deeply they penetrate 
the nearer they come. Hence it is that the infernals dare not come near any heavenly society, but withdraw as far as they can (see n. 4225, 4226, 4299, 4533, 4674, 5057, 5058, 7519). From all this 
it is now evident what is meant by the attention, and the approach of heaven, which are signified by "Moses stretching forth his hand toward heaven;" for a new state is now described, namely, the state 
of falsities from evils destroying all the goods and truths of the church with those who infest; and as this state arises through a more present influx of truth from the Divine, and at the same time 
through the approach of heaven, therefore it is said to Moses that he should "stretch forth his hand toward heaven." </p>

'Stretch out your hand towards heaven' means attention drawn to heaven, which would then come nearer. This is clear from the meaning of 'stretching out the hand' as drawing attention to something, for 
an outstretched hand is used to draw attention to something and point it out; and from the meaning of 'heaven' as the angelic heaven. And since, when a person's attention is drawn to heaven and it is 
pointed out to him, he also turns his gaze and thought in that direction, its coming nearer is also meant; for in the spiritual world things are brought nearer by focusing thought on them. The nature 
of these matters has, it is true, been discussed already in <a href="7519.htm">7519</a>. Even so, since they are the kinds of things that are unknown in the world, let a little more be said to illustrate them. When any change 
of state needs to take place with the evil undergoing vastation, such as happens to those who are the subject in the present chapters, the change is brought about by a more immediate inflow of goodness 
and truth from heaven. For the closer heaven comes to them, the more internal are the evils and falsities which are activated with them. Goodness and truth from heaven reach in towards the interiors; 
and the nearer heaven gets, the further in they reach. This explains why those from hell do not dare to move towards any heavenly community but get away as far as they can, see <a href="4225.htm">4225</a>, <a href="4226.htm">4226</a>, <a href="4299.htm">4299</a>, <a href="4533.htm">4533</a>, <a href="4674.htm">4674</a>, <a href="5057.htm">5057</a>, <a href="5058.htm">5058</a>, <a href="7519.htm">7519</a>. From all this one now may see what one is to understand by attention drawn to heaven, which would then come nearer, meant when it says that Moses should stretch out his 
hand towards heaven. A new state is being described now, that is to say, a state in which falsities arising from evils are destructive of all the Church's forms of good and its truths residing with those 
who molest. And since this state is brought about by a more immediate inflow of truth from God and at the same time by heaven's drawing closer, Moses is therefore told to stretch out his hand towards heaven. </p>

`Extende manum tuam versus caelum': quod significet advertentiam et appropinquationem caeli, constat ex significatione `extendere manum' quod sit advertere, nam per extensionem manus advertitur et ostenditur; 
et ex significatione `caeli' quod sit caelum angelicum; et quia cum caelum advertitur et ei ostenditur, etiam illuc intendit visum et cogitationem, inde etiam significatur appropinquatio, nam 
omnis appropinquatio in mundo spirituali fit per determinationem cogitationis; haec quomodo se habent, quidem prius n. 7519 dictum est; sed quia talia sunt quae in mundo ignota sunt, paucis adhuc {1}illustrare 
licet: quando aliqua (t)mutatio status fiet apud malos qui vastandi, sicut apud hos de quibus in his capitibus, tunc fit illa mutatio per praesentiorem influxum boni (c)et veri e caelo; quo 
enim propius ad illos accedit caelum, eo magis interiora mala et falsa apud illos excitantur; nam bonum et verum e caelo penetrant versus interiora, et eo penitius, quo propinquius; inde est quod infernales 
non ausint prope accedere ad aliquam societatem caelestem, sed quod recedant quantum possunt, videatur n. 4225, 4226, 4299, 4533, 4674, 5057, 5058, 7519.  Ex his nunc patet quid intelligitur 
per advertentiam et appropinquationem caeli, quae significantur per quod `Moscheh extenderet manum versus caelum'; novus enim status, nunc describitur, nempe status falsorum ex malis destruentium omnia 
bona et vera Ecclesiae apud illos qui infestant; qui status, quia existit per praesentiorem influxum veri a Divino, et simul per accessionem caeli, ideo dicitur ad Moschen quod `extenderet manum versus 
caelum.' 	@1 illa illustranda sunt$ </p>
