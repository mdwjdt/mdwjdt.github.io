<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">内义</h4><br />3904.创世记30:1，2.拉结见自己不给雅各生子，就嫉妒她姐姐，对雅各说，你给我儿子，不然我就死了。雅各的怒气就向拉结发作，说，我岂能代替神呢？是祂使你没有腹中的果子。<br />“拉结见自己不给雅各生子”表内在真理尚未得到承认。“就嫉妒她姐姐”表对它不像外在真理那样得到承认的愤慨。“对雅各说，你给我儿子”表通过属世真理的良善拥有内在真理的渴望。“不然我就死了”表否则，（对内在真理的情感）就不会复活。“雅各的怒气就向拉结发作”表属世良善这一方的愤慨。“说，我岂能代替神呢”表良善是无能为力的。“是祂使你没有腹中的果子”表这必须源于内在之物。</p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE. </p>
<p>Verses 1, 2. And Rachel saw that she did not bear to Jacob, and Rachel was zealous against her sister; and she said unto Jacob, Give me sons; and if not, I am dead. And Jacob was 
kindled with anger against Rachel, and he said, Am I in God's stead, who withholdeth from thee the fruit of the belly? "And Rachel saw that she did not bear to Jacob," signifies that interior truth 
was not yet acknowledged; "and Rachel was zealous against her sister," signifies indignation that it was not acknowledged as was external truth; "and she said unto Jacob, Give me sons," signifies that 
there was a desire to have interior truths from the good of natural truth; "and if not, I am dead," signifies that thus there would be no rising again; "and Jacob was kindled with anger against Rachel," 
signifies indignation on the part of natural good; "and he said, Am I in God's stead," signifies that it was impossible for it; "who withholdeth from thee the fruit of the belly," signifies that 
this must be from the internal. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1, 2 And Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob [any children], and Rachel was jealous of her sister, and said to Jacob, Give me sons; if you do not, I am dead. And Jacob 
flared up in anger against Rachel, and he said, Am I in God's place, who is withholding from you the fruit of the womb? </p>
<p>'Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob [any children]' means that interior 
truth was not yet acknowledged. 'And Rachel was jealous of her sister' means indignation that it was not being acknowledged as external truth was. 'And said to Jacob, Give me sons' means a desire 
to have interior truths by the good of natural truth. 'If you do not, I am dead' means that otherwise [the affection for interior truth] would not rise again. 'And Jacob flared up in anger against Rachel' 
means indignation on the part of natural good. 'And he said, Am I in God's place' means that good was powerless. 'Who is withholding from you the fruit of the womb' means that it had to originate 
in what was internal. </p>

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Vers. 1, 2.  {1}Et vidit Rachel quod non pareret Jacobo, et zelavit Rachel in sororem suam, et dixit ad Jacobum, Da mihi filios, et si non, mortua ego.  Et accensus ira Jacob in 
Rachelem, et dixit, An pro Deo ego, Qui prohibet a te fructum ventris? `Vidit Rachel quod non pareret Jacobo' significat quod nondum interius verum agnitum: `et zelavit Rachel in sororem suam' significat indignationem 
quod non agnosceretur sicut externum: `et dixit ad Jacobum, Da mihi filios' significat quod a veri naturalis bono vellet habere vera interiora: `et si non, mortua ego' significat quod 
sic non resurgeret: `et accensus ira Jacob in Rachelem' significat indignationem a parte boni naturalis: `et dixit, An pro Deo ego' significat quod ei impossibile: `Qui prohibet a te fructum ventris' 
significat quod hoc ab interno. @1 In A verse 1 was at first treated separately, verse 2 and its explanation were inserted later.$ </p>
