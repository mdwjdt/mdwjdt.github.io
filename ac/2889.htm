<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2889节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2889.</strong>恶灵不能理解他们并非靠自己活着，并且他们只是生命的器官；更不能理解除了来自善与真之物外，根本没有任何生命存在，最不能理解的是，直到他们所在的恶欲和谬念灭绝，他们才开始活着。他们以为若丧失这些，他们便无丝毫生命存留；而事实却是，直到除去恶欲与谬念的生命之时，他们才第一次开始活着；在此之前，主，连同良善与真理（生命唯独在它们里面）以一种祂未曾有过的方式被接受。就在这时，聪明与智慧，以及真生命也流入进来，以后则日益大量涌入，连同幸福快乐，因而连同至内在的喜悦，还伴随着无法形容的多样化，直到永远。</p>

Evil spirits cannot possibly apprehend that they do not live from themselves, and that they are only organs of life; still less that there is no life except that which is from good and truth; and still 
less that they do not begin to live until the life of the cupidities of evil and of the persuasions of falsity, in which they are, is extinguished. They believe that if they were deprived of these 
there could be nothing of life remaining; whereas the truth is that when they have lost the life of the cupidities of evil and of the persuasions of falsity, they then first begin to live; and that the 
Lord, together with the good and truth in which life solely consists, is not till then received; and that intelligence and wisdom, and thus the veriest life, then flow in, and are afterwards immensely 
increased; and this with delight, blessedness, and happiness, and thus with inmost joy, and with ineffable variety, to eternity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2889</b></p><p><b>2889.</b>
Evil spirits are quite incapable of comprehending that they do not live independently of themselves and that they are merely organs of life. Still less can they comprehend that there is any life except 
that which comes from good and truth, and least of all that they do not start to live until the life of evil desires and false persuasions in which they are immersed is annihilated. They believe that 
if they were deprived of these no life at all could possibly be left to them, whereas the truth of the matter is that once they have got rid of the life of evil desires and of false persuasions they 
start to live for the first time, and the Lord, together with good and truth in which alone life consists, is received in a way He had not been previously. At that point also intelligence and wisdom, 
and so life itself, flow in, and after that increasingly and immeasurably so, together with delight, blessedness, and happiness, and so with inmost joy, and with a variety beyond description that continues 
endlessly. </p>

{1}.  Spiritus mali haudquaquam capere possunt quod non vivant ex se, et quod solum organa vitae sint, minus quod nulla vita sit quam quae ex bono et vero, et adhuc minus quod non vivere incipiant priusquam 
exstincta sit vita cupiditatum mali et persuasionum falsi in quibus sunt; credunt si illis privarentur, quod nihil vitae residuum esse possit:  cum tamen ita se habet, cum vitam cupiditatum mali 
et persuasionum falsi amiserint, quod tunc primum vivere incipiant, et quod Dominus cum bono et vero, in quibus unice vita consistit, non prius recipiatur; et quod tunc intelligentia et sapientia, ita 
ipsissima vita, influat, et dein in immensum augeatur; et hoc cum jucundo, beato et felici, ita cum intimo gaudio, et hoc varietate ineffabili in aeternum. @1 as paragraph 2882, see note there.$ </p>
