<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2094节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2094.</strong>前一章和本章，直到此处，一直论述的是主里面理性的孕育和生出；而下文则论述它如何变成神性。不过，有人可能认为知道这些细节对信没有多大益处，只要人们知道主的人性本质变成了神性，并且主就人性本质和神性本质而言是神就可以了。然而，情况是这样：简单相信这一点的人的确没有必要知道它如何变成神性，因为知道它如何变成神性仅仅是为了让他们相信事实的确如此。<br />但是，如今有很多人不信任何事，除非他们知道事情的来龙去脉。这一点从以下事实可以看出来：很少有人相信主，尽管他们口头上承认祂，因为信的教义就是这样教导的。然而，他们仍对自己并彼此说，若知道事实会是这样，他们必相信。他们不相信，却仍这样说的原因在于，主像其他人一样出生，并且表面上和其他人没什么两样。这些人不可能接受任何信，除非他们首先在某种程度上知道事情的来龙去脉。这就是为何解释这些事的原因。而那些简单相信圣言的人则没有必要知道所有这些细节，因为他们已达到刚才所说的那些人唯有通过知晓这类细节才能达到的目的。<br />而且，这些就是包含在内义中的细节，内义就是主在天堂的圣言。天堂里的人就是以这种方式理解圣言的。当有人接触真理，即内义时，他的思维就会与天堂里的人合为一体，哪怕他的观念相对来说非常笼统和模糊。那里的属天天使拥有信本身，并通过良善看待这些事，发现它们如此来自良善。而属灵天使则通过真理看待这些事；他们也确认，并因此通过诸如包含在内义中的那类事物被完善。不过，这种确认是通过成千上万次的内在推理实现的，而这些推理无法以可察觉的方式流入世人的思维模式。</p>

In the preceding chapter, and up to this point in the present one, the subject has been the conception and birth of the rational that appertained to the Lord; and how it was made Divine is also treated 
of in what follows. But some may suppose that to know these things does not conduce much to faith, provided it is known that the Lord's Human Essence was made Divine, and that the Lord is God as to 
both the Human Essence and the Divine Essence. But the case is this: They who in simplicity believe this to be so, do not need to know how it was effected, for knowing how it was effected is simply for 
the end that they may believe it to be so.  [2] But at the present day there are many who believe nothing unless they know from reason that it is so, as may be clearly seen from the fact that few 
believe in the Lord, although they confess Him with the lips because this is according to the doctrine of faith. Yet still they say to themselves and to one another that if they knew it could be so they 
would believe. The reason why they do not believe and yet say this, is that the Lord was born as are other men, and in the external form was like others. These persons cannot possibly receive any faith 
unless they first comprehend in some measure how it can be so, and this is why these things have been explained. They who believe the Word in simplicity have no need to know all these things, for 
they are already in the end to which the others just described cannot come except by a knowledge [cognitio] of such things.  [3] Moreover these are the things that are contained in the internal sense, 
and the internal sense is the Word of the Lord in the heavens, and is so perceived by those who are there. When a man is in the truth, that is, in the internal sense, he can make one as to thought 
with those in heaven, even though he may be in a relatively very general and obscure idea. The celestial in heaven, who are in faith itself, look at these things from good, and see that they are so; but 
the spiritual look at them from truth and are also confirmed, and thus perfected, by such things as are contained in the internal sense; but this by thousands of interior reasons which cannot flow 
perceptibly into man's idea. </p>

The previous chapter and the present chapter up to this point have dealt with the conception and birth of the Rational within the Lord; and how this was made Divine is also dealt with in what follows. 
But some may possibly suppose that knowing these details does not contribute very much to faith, provided one knows that the Lord's Human Essence was made Divine and that the Lord is God as regards 
both Essences. The position however is this: People who in simplicity believe it to be so do not need to know how it became so, for the only reason for their knowing how it became so is so that they may 
believe that it is so. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 There are many at the present day who do not believe anything unless they know it to be so from reason, as is made quite clear from the fact that few believe in the Lord, 
although they make lip confession of belief for the reason that the doctrine of faith so teaches. Nevertheless they tell themselves and one another that if they knew it could be so they would believe. 
The reason they do not believe and yet say this is that the Lord was born as any other is born and to outward appearance was like any other. These people cannot possibly receive any faith unless 
they first of all grasp in some measure how it can be so. This is why these matters have been explained. Those who believe the Word in simplicity do not need to know all these details because they have 
already arrived at the end which those who have just been described cannot reach except by becoming acquainted with such details. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 What is more, these are the details which are contained in the 
internal sense, and the internal sense is the Word of the Lord in heaven. Those who are in heaven perceive it in this fashion. When someone is in touch with the truth, that is, with the internal sense, 
he is able to make one as to thought with those in heaven, even though his ideas are by comparison very general and very obscure. The celestial ones there, who possess faith itself, see that those 
things are so from good, whereas the spiritual ones see the same from truth. The spiritual ones are also confirmed, and in that way perfected, by such things as are contained in the internal sense, that 
confirmation being achieved however by means of thousands of interior reasons which cannot flow into man's pattern of thought so as to be perceived there. </p>

{1} In capite praecedente et in hoc huc usque actum est de conceptione et nativitate Rationalis apud Dominum; et quomodo Divinum factum, agitur etiam in sequentibus; sed autumare quidam possunt quod 
haec scire non ad fidem ita conducat, modo sciatur quod Humana Domini Essentia facta sit Divina et quod Dominus quoad utramque sit Deus; sed ita se res habet: qui simpliciter hoc credunt, non opus habent 
scire quomodo factum, nam scire quomodo factum, est solum ob finem ut credant quod ita sit; [2] sunt hodie plures qui nihil credunt nisi sciant ratione quod ita sit, quod manifeste constare potest 
ex eo quod pauci credant in Dominum, tametsi ore fatentur {2}, quia est secundum doctrinam fidei: at usque dicunt {3} intra se et inter se, si scirent quod ita esse possit, quod credituri; quod non 
credant, et ita dicunt, est causa quia Dominus natus est sicut alius homo, et externa forma fuit sicut alius; hi nusquam aliquam fidem accipere possunt, nisi prius aliquo modo capiant quomodo ita esse 
possit; ideo haec.  Qui Verbo simpliciter credunt, non opus habent omnia haec scire, quia in fine sunt, ad quem illi de quibus dictum, non possunt venire nisi per cognitionem talium.  Praeterea haec 
sunt quae in sensu interno continentur, et sensus internus est Verbum Domini in caelis; qui in caelis, percipiunt illud ita; quando homo in vero est, hoc est, in sensu interno, tunc cum illis in caelo 
unum facere potest quoad cogitationem, tametsi homo in communissima et obscurissima idea est respective: caelestes ibi, qui {4} in ipsa fide, spectant illa ex bono, quod ita sit; sed spirituales ex vero, 
qui etiam per talia quae continentur in sensu interno, confirmantur, et sic perficiuntur, sed hoc per millia rationum interiorum quae non in hominis ideam apperceptibiliter {5} influere possunt. 	@1
