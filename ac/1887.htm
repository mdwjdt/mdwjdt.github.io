<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1887节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1887.</strong>启示意味着圣言的每一个细节（包括历史的和其它部分的）都含有爱或良善的属天事物和信或真理的属灵事物，因而含有神性事物。因为主的启示是从祂那里降下来的，事实上是经由天使天堂降下来的，并以同样的方式经由灵人界降至人类，然后以诸如文字的方式与人类同在。但就其最初起源而言，它完全是另一回事。天堂从来没有任何世俗的历史，全都是神性事物的代表物，也没有对任何其它事物的感知。从以下事实也可得知这一点，即那里的事物是无法形容的。因此，除非这些历史是神性事物的代表物，因而是天堂之物，否则，它们决不可能是神性启示。在天堂，圣言的性质唯有通过内义才能得知，因为内义就是主在天堂的圣言。</p>

Inspiration implies that in every particular of the Word (as well in the historicals as in the other parts) there are celestial things which are of love or good, and spiritual things which are of faith 
or truth, thus Divine things. For that which is inspired by the Lord descends from Him, and does so through the angelic heaven, and so through the world of spirits down to man, with whom it is presented 
such as it is in the letter; but in its first origin it is altogether different. In heaven there is never any worldly history, but all is representative of Divine things, and there is no perception 
there of anything else, as may also be known from the fact that the things which are there are unutterable. Unless therefore the historicals were representative of Divine things, and in this way were 
heavenly, they could not possibly be Divinely inspired. The Word as it exists in the heavens can be known solely from the internal sense, for the internal sense is the Word of the Lord in the heavens. </p>

Inspiration implies that every detail of the Word - within its historical narratives as well as in all other parts - has within it the celestial things of love or good, and the spiritual things of faith 
or truth, and so has Divine things within it. For that which is inspired by the Lord comes down from Him, coming down in fact by way of the angelic heaven, then in the same manner by way of the world 
of spirits, down to mankind, with whom it presents itself as it exists in the letter. But in its first origins it is something entirely different. In heaven nothing belonging to the history of the 
world ever has a place there, but everything is a representative of something Divine. Nor is anything else ever perceived there, as may also be recognized to be so from the fact that the things existing 
there are indescribable. Unless therefore the historical descriptions are representative of Divine things, and so heavenly things, they cannot possibly be divinely inspired. The nature of the Word 
in the heavens is recognizable solely from the internal sense, for the Internal Sense is the Word of the Lord in the heavens. </p>

</p><b>1887.</b>
Inspiratio involvit quod in singulis Verbi, tam in illius historicis quam in reliquis, sint caelestia quae amoris seu boni, et spiritualia quae sunt fidei seu veri, ita Divina: quod enim a Domino inspiratur, 
hoc descendit ab Ipso, et quidem per caelum angelicum et sic per mundum spirituum usque ad hominem, apud quem sistitur quale est in littera, sed prorsus aliter est in prima sua origine; in caelo 
nusquam est aliquod historicum mundanum, sed omne est repraesentativum Divinorum, nec quicquam aliud ibi percipitur, ut quoque notum potest esse ex eo quod ineffabilia sint quae ibi; quare nisi historica 
sint repraesentativa Divinorum, et sic caelestia, nusquam possunt esse divinitus inspirata.  Quale est Verbum in caelis, {1} hoc noscitur solum ex sensu interno, nam Sensus Internus est Verum 
Domini caelis. 	@1 seu in Divinis.$ </p>
