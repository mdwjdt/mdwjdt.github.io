<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第50节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>50.</strong>上古教会对主的“形像”的领悟，是述说不尽的。主藉天使和精灵引导人，至少有两个精灵和两位天使与每个人同在，对于这些，人毫不知情。藉着精灵，人与精灵界相交；藉着天使，人与天堂相交。若非有精灵和天使作为联系的媒介，使得人与精灵界并天堂相交，进而藉天堂与主相交，人就不能存活。人的生命完全取决于这种联系。精灵和天使若退离，人必立时灭亡。<br />人重生之前，他受引导的方式与已得重生者完全不同。重生之前，人被恶灵缠缚，天使虽与他同在，却爱莫能助，不过尽量阻止他奔向极恶，引他折向一定的良善，甚至利用他的欲望，引他折向良善，利用他的感官幻相，引他折向真理。如此，他通过周遭的灵与精灵界相交，但与天堂的相交并不紧密，因为恶灵占据了优势，天使只有削弱他们的影响力。<br />但是，人重生之后，天使就占据了优势，使他在各种良善与真理上获得灵感，并对邪恶和虚假产生恐惧。不过，天使只是辅助者，主才是主导者，天使和精灵是他的媒介。因有天使辅助，故本节经文，“我们要照着我们的形像”，所用的是复数。但唯有主才是主导者，故下节经文，“神就照他的形像造人”，所用的又是单数。关于这一点，主清楚地宣告说：“从你出胎，造就你的救赎主耶和华如此说，我耶和华是创造万物的，是独自铺张诸天，铺开大地的。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.24.htm">44:24</a>）天使也承认自己本无能力，一切都是靠主而行。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]50.</strong> What the people of the earliest church meant when they spoke of the Lord's image involves more than can be put into words.<br />People have no idea whatever that the Lord governs them through angels and spirits, or that at least two spirits and two angels accompany each of them. The spirits create a link with the world of spirits,{*1} and the angels create one with heaven. We cannot possibly live without a channel of communication open to the world of spirits through spirits and to heaven through angels (and in this way to the Lord through heaven). Our life depends totally on such a connection. If the spirits and angels withdrew from us, we would be destroyed in a second.<br />[2] As long as we are unregenerate, we are governed in a completely different way than the regenerate. Before regeneration we have with us evil spirits whose grip on us is so strong that the angels, though present, can achieve hardly any results. All they can do is head us off from rushing into the worst kind of evil and divert us toward some form of good. They even use our own appetites to lead us toward good, and the illusions of our senses to lead us toward truth. Under these circumstances we communicate with the world of spirits by means of the spirits around us but not so much with heaven, since the evil spirits are in charge and the angels only deflect their influence.<br />[3] When we are regenerate, on the other hand, the angels are in charge, inspiring us with all kinds of goodness and truth and instilling a horror and fear of evil and falsity.<br />Angels do give us guidance, but they are mere helpers; the Lord alone governs us, through angels and spirits. Since angels have their assisting role, the words of this verse appear in the plural — "Let us make a human in our image." But since only the Lord rules and manages us, the next verse uses the singular — "God created the human in his image." The Lord states his role clearly in Isaiah:<br />This is what Jehovah has said, your Redeemer and the one who formed you from the womb: "I, Jehovah, make all things, stretching the heavens out on my own, spreading the earth out by myself." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_50/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_44_24" target=_top>Isaiah 44:24</a>)<br />The angels themselves confess that they have no power but act only at the Lord's behest.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the world of spirits, see note 3 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_50/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_0" target=_top>0</a>.

The Most Ancient Church understood by the "image of the Lord" more than can be expressed. Man is altogether ignorant that he is governed of the Lord through angels and spirits, and that with everyone 
there are at least two spirits, and two angels. By spirits man has communication with the world of spirits, and by angels with heaven. Without communication by means of spirits with the world of spirits, 
and by means of angels with heaven, and thus through heaven with the Lord, man could not live at all; his life entirely depends on this conjunction, so that if the spirits and angels were to withdraw, 
he would instantly perish.  [2] While man is unregenerate he is governed quite otherwise than when regenerated. While unregenerate there are evil spirits with him, who so domineer over him that 
the angels, though present, are scarcely able to do anything more than merely guide him so that he may not plunge into the lowest evil, and bend him to some good-in fact bend him to good by means of 
his own cupidities, and to truth by means of the fallacies of the senses. He then has communication with the world of spirits through the spirits who are with him, but not so much with heaven, because 
evil spirits rule, and the angels only avert their rule. [3] But when the man is regenerate, the angels rule, and inspire him with all goods and truths, and with fear and horror of evils and falsities. 
The angels indeed lead, but only as ministers, for it is the Lord alone who governs man through angels and spirits. And as this is done through the ministry of angels, it is here first said, in the 
plural number, "Let us make man in our image;" and yet because the Lord alone governs and disposes, it is said in the following verse, in the singular number, "God created him in His own image." This 
the Lord also plainly declares in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thus saith Jehovah thy Redeemer, and He that formed thee from the womb, I Jehovah make all things, stretching forth the heavens alone, spreading abroad 
the earth by Myself (Isa. 44:24). The angels moreover themselves confess that there is no power in them, but that they act from the Lord alone. </p>

What the Most Ancient Church understood by 'the image of the Lord' exceeds everything one can say about it. Man is totally unaware of the fact that the Lord is governing him by means of angels and spirits, 
and that at least two spirits and two angels are present with everyone. By means of the spirits he is in communication with the world of spirits, and by means of the angels with heaven. Without 
this communication with the world of spirits by means of the spirits, and with heaven by means of the angels, and so by means of heaven with the Lord, a person cannot exist at all. His entire life depends 
upon that link, and if the spirits and angels were to withdraw he would perish instantly.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As long as a person remains unregenerate he is governed in an entirely different way from when he 
is regenerate. As long as he is unregenerate, evil spirits reside with him, who have such dominion over him that angels, though present, can accomplish little more than simply distract him from plunging 
into utter evil and so divert him towards something good. Indeed they use his own unregenerate desires to divert him towards good, and his illusions of the senses to do so towards truth. At that 
point he is in communication with the world of spirits by means of the spirits who reside with him, but not in the same way with heaven, for the reason that evil spirits have dominion and angels simply 
forestall them.   </p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 When however he is regenerate it is the angels who then have dominion, and they breathe into him every kind of good and truth, as well as a horror and dread of evils and falsifies. 
Angels do indeed lead, yet they are but servants, for it is the Lord alone who, by means of angels and spirits, governs a person. Now because this is done through the ministry of angels, it is 
said here, in the plural first of all, 'Let Us make man in Our image'. Yet because it is still He alone who rules and disposes, it is said in the following verse, in the singular, 'God created him in 
His image'. This the Lord also states plainly in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah, your Redeemer, He who formed you from the womb, I Jehovah make all things, stretching out the heavens Alone, spreading out 
the earth by Myself. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2044:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 44:24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Angels themselves also profess that no power at all resides with themselves but that they act from the Lord alone.  </p>

</p><b>50.</b>
Quid Antiquissima Ecclesia per 'imaginem Domini' intellexerunt, plura sunt quam ut dici possint. Homo nescit prorsus quod regatur a Domino per angelos et spiritus et quod apud unum quemvis hominem sint 
ad minimum bini spiritus et bini angeli; per spiritus fit communicatio hominis cum mundo spirituum, et per angelos, cum caelo; absque communicatione hominis per spiritus cum mundo spirituum et per 
angelos cum caelo, et sic per caelum cum Domino, nequaquam vivere potest; vita ejus pendet prorsus a conjunctione illa; si recederent spiritus et angeli, momento periret. Quamdiu homo non regeneratus 
est, regitur prorsus aliter quam cum regeneratus; cum non regeneratus, apud eum sunt spiritus mali qui dominantur ita super eum ut angeli tametsi adsunt, vix quicquam efficere possint qua solum dirigere 
ne praecipitet se in ultimum malum, et flectere eum ad quoddam bonum, et quidem per propria ejus cupiditates ad bonum, et per fallacias sensuum ad verum; tunc communicationem habet cum mundo spirituum 
per spiritus qui apud eum, sed non ita cum caelo, quia spiritus mali dominantur et angeli solum avertunt. Cum autem regeneratus est, tunc dominantur angeli et omnia bona et vera ei inspirant, ac 
horrorem et timorem pro malis e falsis. Angeli quidem ducunt, sed solum ministrant, nam Dominus solus est qui hominem regit per angelos et spiritus; et quia fit ministerio angelorum, hic primum dicitur 
in plurali, 'faciamus hominem in imaginem nostram'; sed quia solus usque regit et disponit, in subsequente versu dicitur in singulari, 'creabat Deus illum in imaginem Suam'; quod etiam Dominus clare 
dicit apud Esaiam, Ita dixit Jehovah Redemptor tuus, et Formator tuus ab utero, Ego Jehovah facio omnia, extendens caelos Solus, expandens terram a Me Ipso, xliv 24. Ipsi angeli etiam fatentur quod 
nihil potestatis apud eos, sed quod Solo Domino agant. </p>
