<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>821.</strong>有些人表面一副诚实的面孔，似乎具有诚实的生命，以至于没人怀疑他们的诚实。为了获取名利而又无需丧失名声，他们方方面面都要仔细研究，以维持这种表象。所以，他们不公开行动，而是利用狡猾的手段，藉着其他人剥夺别人的财物，根本不关心他们所剥夺的家庭会不会死于饥饿。倘能逃避公众视线，他们本人就会做出这种事来，毫无良知可言。因此，他们的秉性和他们的实际行为一模一样。他们是暗中的盗贼，与其各种仇恨相苟合的，是轻蔑、贪婪、无情和欺骗。在来生（灵界），这种人希望被认为是无罪的，声称他们没有做错什么，因为什么也没发现。为了表明自己是无罪的，他们脱掉衣服，赤身露体，以证明自己的无辜。但是，当接受检查时，从他们所使用的特定表达方式和构成其思维的特定想法就能觉察出他们的本质，尽管他们没有意识到这一点。<br />在来生（灵界），这种人毫无良知地想要谋杀凡他们所遇见的伙伴。他们手里还拿着一把斧头和一个木槌，并且似乎还有另一个精灵与他们同在。当这个精灵仰面躺下时，他们就攻击他，但没有流血，因为他们害怕死亡。他们无法扔掉手中的武器，尽管他们竭尽全力去扔，以免他们凶残的本性暴露在精灵和天使眼前。这些精灵就在两脚下面朝前的中间距离处。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]821.</strong> There are some who maintain an outwardly honest face and honest life to avoid arousing suspicion that they are anything but upright. They eagerly pursue every method of so appearing in order to rise to prominent positions and to get rich without risking their reputation. For this reason they do not act openly. Instead they use agents to strip others of their goods by devious stratagems, not caring in the least whether the families they plunder die of starvation. If it could remain out of sight to the world, they would do the job themselves without a pang of conscience. Still, their character is the same as if they had committed the act themselves. They are covert thieves, and their particular type of hatred involves pride, greed, ruthlessness, and deceit.<br />[2] When people like this arrive in the other world, they claim to be innocent, saying they have done nothing wrong, since they have never been caught. To demonstrate their blamelessness, they take off their clothes and stand naked, giving witness to their purity. When they are questioned, others perceive exactly what they are like from every word they speak and every thought they think, although they themselves do not realize this is happening.<br />Every acquaintance they come across in the next life they desire to kill, untroubled by remorse. In their hands they hold an axe and a hammer, while at their feet they seem to have another spirit lying face up, whom they strike. They do not go so far as to spill blood, however, being fearful of death. What is more, they are unable to toss their weapons from their hands, although they try with all their might, in order to keep from being seen for what they are. They do not want the fierceness of their disposition to show in front of spirits and angels.<br />They occupy a place in the middle distance, under the feet and toward the front. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 821</b></p><p><b>821.</b>
There are those who outwardly present an honorable face and life, so that no one could suspect them of being other than honorable, studying in every way to appear so, for the sake of being raised to 
honors, and of acquiring wealth without the loss of reputation. They therefore do not act openly; but through others by deceitful artifices they deprive men of their goods, caring nothing if the families 
they despoil perish of hunger, and they would themselves be personal agents in this villainy, without any conscience, if they could escape public notice, so that they really are of the same character 
as if they perpetrated it by their own act. They are hidden robbers, and the kind of hatred peculiar to them is joined with scornful contempt for others, greed of gain, unmercifulness, and deceit. 
In the other life such men desire to be esteemed blameless, saying that they have done nothing wrong, because it was not detected. And to show themselves guiltless, they put off their garments and present 
themselves naked-in this way attesting their innocence. Yet while they are being examined their quality is thoroughly well perceived from every single word and every single idea of their thought, 
without their being aware of it. Such, in the other life, desire without any conscience to murder whatever companions they fall in with. They have also an axe with them, and a maul in their hand, and 
seem to have another spirit with them whom they strike, when on his back; but not to the shedding of blood, for they are afraid of death. And they cannot cast these weapons out of their hands although 
they strive to do so with all their might, in order to prevent the actual ferocity of their disposition from appearing before the eyes of spirits and angels. They are at a middle distance under the 
feet, toward the front. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 821</b></p><p><b>821.</b>
There are people who outwardly present an honest face and life so that nobody can suspect them of being anything other than honest. In every way they study carefully how, for the sake of preferment and 
of getting rich without loss of reputation, to preserve this appearance. Consequently they do not act openly, but by means of others deprive other people of their goods by cunning devices, not caring 
at all whether the families they deprive might die of hunger. If they could avoid being seen by the world, they themselves would carry it out without any conscience in the matter. In character therefore 
they are just the same as if they had actually done it themselves. Secretly they are robbers, and coupled to their variety of hatred are contempt, avarice, mercilessness, and deceit. Such people 
in the next life wish to be considered guiltless, saying that they have done nothing wrong because nothing had been discovered. And to show that they are blameless, they take off their clothes and stand 
naked as a way of attesting their innocence. But while they are being examined, what they are really like is perceived from the particular expressions they use and from the particular ideas comprising 
their thinking, though they do not realize this. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Such people in the next life wish to murder without conscience any associates they light upon. They also have with them an axe and a mallet 
in their hand, and there seems to be another spirit present with them whom they strike as he lies stretched out, without however shedding any blood, for they are afraid of death. Nor can they cast those 
instruments out of their hands, however much they try with all their might to do so, to prevent its being seen that they are such, and to prevent the viciousness of their disposition becoming apparent 
before the eyes of spirits and angels. These spirits are at a middle distance beneath the feet, towards the front. </p>

</p><b>821.</b>
Dantur qui extrinsecus ferunt faciem et vitam honestam, sic ut nemo aliud suspicari possit quam quod sint honesti, studentes omni modo ita apparere ob causam emergendi in honores et absque jactura famae 
lucrandi; quare nec aperte {1}faciunt, sed per alios; artificiis dolosis spoliant alios suis bonis, nihil curantes si familiae quas spoliant, fame perirent; quod si non pateret coram mundo ipsi actu 
facerent absque conscientia; ii usque sunt tales ac si actu fecissent. Sunt latrones occulti, et genus eorum odii est cum fastu, aviditate lucri, immisericordia et dolo conjunctum.  Tales in altera 
vita volunt insontes esse, dicentes se nihil mali fecisse quia non detectum; utque inculpatos se praebeant, exuunt vestes, sistunt se nudos, testantes sic innocentiam: dum examinantur, ex singulis vocibus 
et ex singulis ideis cogitationis percipiuntur prorsus quales sunt, quod ignorant.  Tales in altera vita socios, quoscumque offendunt, absque conscientia necare cupiunt; et apud se habent securim 
et malleum in manu, et videntur habere alium spiritum apud se quem supinatum percutiunt, sed non ad sanguinis effusionem, quia timidi sunt mortis; nec possunt instrumenta ista e manu projicere, quod 
tamen summa opera conantur ne videantur tales, ut animi eorum ferocia coram spiritibus et angelis appareat: sunt in media distantia sub pedibus versus anteriora. 	@1 I has faciunt; sed per alios, but
