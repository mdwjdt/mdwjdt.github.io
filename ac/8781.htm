<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8781节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8781.</strong>“看哪，我要在密云中临到你们那里”表它将以一种完全属世的形式被作出。这从“临到你们那里”和“密云”的含义清楚可知：当耶和华对代表属灵教会所拥有的从神来的真理的摩西（<a href="8760.htm">8760</a>节）说，“临到你们那里”时，“临到你们那里”是指启示；“密云”是指以一种完全属世的形式，诸如文字上的旧约圣言的那种形式。“云”表示文字上的圣言（参看创世记18章序言，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4391.htm">4391</a>，<a href="5922.htm">5922</a>，<a href="6343.htm">6343</a>e，<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>，<a href="8106.htm">8106</a>，<a href="8443.htm">8443</a>节）；“密”表示模糊，诸如人的思维被纯感官之光，也就是完全属世的光光照时的那种模糊。那时雅各的后代，以及当今的犹太人在思想神性时就陷入这种模糊；因为若不照着自己的生命状态和由此而来的觉知，谁也看不见神性。因此，对那些沉浸于自我之爱和尘世之爱的人来说，天堂之光必像密云，而犹太民族比其它民族更沉浸于这爱。圣言的文字，尤其预言部分，相对于它的内义来说，并非别的东西。存在于其内义中的光好比云顶上的阳光，这光在圣言中被称为“荣耀”。这也解释了为何圣言说，耶和华“在云上”、“乘驾快云”、“在云上飞”、“在云上有行宫”，主“要驾着天上的云”，以及许多类似的句子；它们永远不会被拿来描述耶和华，也就是主，除非它们表示祂在天上所在的真理的亮光，而“云”表示天堂下面的人所在的真理的阴影。</p>

Behold I come unto thee in the density of the cloud. That this signifies that it shall be made in a form the most natural of all, is evident from the signification of "coming unto thee," when said by 
Jehovah to Moses, by whom is represented truth from the Divine which is of the spiritual church (n. 8760), as being revelation; and from the signification of "the density of the cloud," as being to be 
in a form the most natural of all, such as is the Word of the Old Testament in the letter. That "a cloud" denotes the Word in the letter, see the preface to Genesis 18, and n. 4060, 4391, 5922, 6343, 
6752, 8106, 8443; "density" denotes obscurity, such as is that of the thought of man from mere sensuous light, that is, the most natural of all, such as the posterity of Jacob were in at that time, 
and also the Jews at this day, respecting the Divine; for the Divine cannot be seen by anyone otherwise than according to the state of his life and the perception therefrom. Thus heavenly light must be 
like the density of a cloud to those who are in the love of self and of the world, in which love the Jewish nation was more than others. The Word in the letter, especially the prophetic Word, is no 
other relatively to its internal sense. In its internal sense there is light, such as is comparatively the light of the sun above the clouds, which light in the Word is called "glory." Wherefore also 
it is said in the Word that Jehovah "is carried upon the clouds," "rides upon them," "flies upon them," "has His chamber upon them," and that the Lord "will come in the clouds of heaven," with many similar 
statements that would never have been made of Jehovah, that is, of the Lord, unless they had signified the light of truth in which He is in heaven, and "a cloud" the shade of truth in which they 
are who are beneath. </p>

'Behold, I am coming to you in the thickness of a cloud' means that it will be made in a form utterly natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming to you' - when said by Jehovah to Moses, who represents 
the truth from God which the spiritual Church possesses, <a href="8760.htm">8760</a> - as revelation; and from the meaning of 'the thickness of a cloud' as in a form utterly natural, like that in which the Old Testament 
Word exists in the letter. For the meaning of 'a cloud' as the Word in the letter, see preface to Genesis <a href="18.htm">18</a>, and <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="4391.htm">4391</a>, <a href="5922.htm">5922</a>, <a href="6343.htm">6343</a> (end), <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>, <a href="8106.htm">8106</a>, <a href="8443.htm">8443</a>. 'Thickness' means dimness, such 
as that of a person's thought when it is lit solely by the inferior light of the senses, that is, by wholly natural light. It was in dimness such as this that the descendants of Jacob at that time thought 
about the Divine, and also that the Jews at the present day think about Him; for the Divine cannot be seen by anyone except in ways that are in keeping with his state of life and consequent discernment. 
So it is that heavenly light cannot be seen by those ruled by self-love and love of the world, which that nation more than others was ruled by, except as 'the thickness of a cloud'. The letter 
of the Word, especially the prophetical part, is nothing else in contrast to its internal sense. In its internal sense light exists such as may be compared to the light of the sun on top of clouds, 
the light which in the Word is called 'the glory'. This also explains why the Word says that Jehovah is carried on top of the clouds, rides above the clouds, flies above them, has His triclinium<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> above 
them, that the Lord is going to come in the clouds of heaven, and many more statements like these, which would never have been made to describe Jehovah, that is, the Lord, unless they had meant the 
bright light of truth in which He is present in heaven, and 'clouds' had meant a shadowy light of truth in which those below heaven see.

`Ecce Ego veniens ad te in densitate nubis': quod significet quod ea fiet in specie maxime naturali, constat ex significatione `venire ad te' cum dicitur a Jehovah ad Moschen, per quem repraesentatur 
verum a Divino quod est Ecclesiae spiritualis, n. 8760, quod sit revelatio, et ex significatione `densitatis nubis' quod sit in specie maxime naturali, in quali est Verbum Veteris Testamenti in littera; 
quod `nubes' sit Verbum in littera, videatur Praefatio ad Gen. xviii et n. 4060, 4391, 5922, 6343 fin., 6752, 8106, 8443; {1} `densitas' est obscurum quale est cogitationis hominis ex solo lumine 
sensuali, hoc est, maxime naturali; in quali fuerunt illo tempore posteri Jacobi, et quoque hodie Judaei, de Divino, nam Divinum non aliter potest apparere alicui quam secundum statum ejus vitae et inde 
apperceptionis; ita lux caelestis illis qui in amore sui et mundi, in quo gens illa prae aliis fuit, quam sicut `densitas nubis'; Verbum in littera, imprimis propheticum, nec aliud est respective 
ad sensum ejus internum; in sensu ejus interno est lux qualis comparative est lux solis supra nubes, quae lux in Verbo vocatur `gloria'; quare etiam dicitur in Verbo quod Jehovah vehatur super nubes, 
equitet super illis, volet super illis, suum triclinium habeat super illis, quod Dominus venturus in nubibus caeli, et similia plura, quae nusquam de Jehovah, hoc est, de Domino, {2} dicta fuissent, nisi
