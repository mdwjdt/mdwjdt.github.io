<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2027节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2027.</strong>“随从你的你的种”表祂要将其赐给那些将信祂的人。这从“种”的含义清楚可知，“种”是指信（参看<a href="1025.htm">1025</a>，<a href="1447.htm">1447</a>，<a href="1610.htm">1610</a>节），事实上是指仁之信（参看<a href="379.htm">379</a>，<a href="389.htm">389</a>，<a href="654.htm">654</a>，<a href="724.htm">724</a>，<a href="809.htm">809</a>，<a href="916.htm">916</a>，<a href="1017.htm">1017</a>，<a href="1162.htm">1162</a>，<a href="1176.htm">1176</a>，<a href="1258.htm">1258</a>节）。凡将功德置于其生活行为的人都没有仁之信，因而不是此处“种”所指的那些人。因为他们在这样做时不想因主的公义得救，而想因自己的公义得救。他们里面没有仁之信，即没有仁爱。这从以下事实明显可知：他们在人前显摆自己，因而关注自己，而非关注他人，除非他人服侍自己。他们要么蔑视、要么憎恨那些不愿服侍自己的人。于是，他们因我欲而分道扬镳，永远不会走到一起，从而毁灭天堂之物，也就是相爱，而相爱是天堂的支柱。天堂本身就在相爱中，它的整个联系与和谐就在于相爱，并在相爱中持续存在。在来世，凡摧毁和谐之物都有违天堂本身的秩序，因而促使整体毁灭。这就是将功德置于生活行为，将公义据为己有之人的性质。<br />来世有很多这样的人。有时，他们的脸像火把一样闪耀，不过，这是因为幻火，这幻火是自我称义（self-justification）的产物。事实上，他们是冰冷的。有时，他们被看到四处活动，通过圣言的字义来证明自我功德（self-merit）。因为他们憎恨属于内义的真理（<a href="1877.htm">1877</a>节）。他们放射的气场是关注自我的气场，因而是毁灭一切不视自我为某种神明的观念的气场。许多这类人同时放射的气场破坏性极大，以致那里除了敌意和对抗外什么也没有。因为当每个人都有同样的渴望，就是渴望被服侍时，他会发自内心谋杀其他人。<br />其中一些人就在那些声称自己在主的葡萄园里劳碌的人之列，而与此同时，他们不断把心思转向如何提升自己的声望、荣耀和名誉，还有利益，甚至以为他们能在天堂成为最大的，并被天使伺候。与自己相比，他们发自内心蔑视他人，因而没有天堂所在的任何相爱，只有我欲；他们将天堂置于我欲，因为他们不知道何为天堂。关于这些人，可参看前文（<a href="450.htm">450</a>-<a href="452.htm">452</a>，<a href="1594.htm">1594</a>，<a href="1679.htm">1679</a>节）。他们就属于那些想要成为首先的，却成了末后的之人（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.30.htm">19:30</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.16.htm">20:16</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.31.htm">10:31</a>）。他们还是那些声称奉主的名说过预言，行许多异能的人，但主对他们说：“我从来不认识你们”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.22.htm">7:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.23.htm">23</a>）。<br />那些出于简单的心思以为自己配上天堂，但过着仁爱生活的人则截然不同。这些人没有被我欲迷惑，因此与自己相比，并不蔑视他人。他们视配上天堂为一种应许，并且很容易承认这只不过是主的怜悯。因为仁爱的生活具有这种承认，仁爱本身热爱一切真理。</p>

That "to thy seed after thee" signifies that He would give all these things to those who should have faith in Him, is evident from the signification of "seed," as being faith (see n. 1025, 1447, 1610), 
and in fact the faith of charity (see n. 379, 389, 654, 724, 809, 916, 1017, 1162, 1176, 1258). They who place merit in the actions of their lives have not the faith of charity, and therefore are not 
the seed here meant; for thereby they desire to be saved, not because of the Lord's righteousness, but because of their own. That there is no faith of charity in them, that is, no charity, is evident 
from the fact, that they set themselves before others, and thus regard themselves and not others, except insofar as they are of service to them; and they either despise or hate those who are not willing 
to render them service. Thus by the love of self they dissociate, and never associate; and thus destroy what is heavenly, namely, mutual love, which gives heaven its stability; for heaven itself 
is in it, and all its consociation and unanimity subsist and consist in it; for in the other life whatever destroys unanimity is contrary to the order of heaven itself, and thus conspires to the destruction 
of the whole. Such are they who place merit in the actions of their lives, and claim righteousness for themselves. Of these there are many in the other life.  [2] They sometimes shine in the 
face like little torches, but from an illusive fire that proceeds from self-justification, and in fact they are cold. They are sometimes seen running about and confirming self-merit from the literal sense 
of the Word, for they hate the truths which are of the internal sense (n. 1877). Their sphere is a sphere of self-regard, and is thus destructive of all ideas that do not regard self as a kind of 
deity. The sphere of many of this sort together is so conflicting that there is nothing there but enmity and hostility; for when everyone desires the same thing, namely, to be served, he murders others 
in his heart.  [3] Some of them are among those who say that they have labored in the Lord's vineyard, whereas they have at the same time continually had in mind their own preeminence, glory, and 
honors, as well as gain; and even that they might become the greatest in heaven and be served by the angels, in heart despising others in comparison with themselves, and thus being imbued with no mutual 
love, in which heaven consists, but with the love of self, in which they place heaven; for they know not what heaven is. (Respecting such see above, n. 450-452, 1594, 1679.) These are of those who 
desire to be first, but become last (Matt. 19:30; 20:16; Mark 10:31); and who say that they have prophesied by the name of the Lord, and have done many wonderful works; but to whom it is said, "I know 
you not" (Matt. 7:22, 23).  [4] Very different is the case with those who from simplicity of heart have supposed that they merit heaven, and have lived in charity; these have looked upon meriting heaven 
as something that is promised, and they easily acknowledge it to be of the Lord's mercy; for the life of charity is attended with this, because true charity loves all truth. </p>

'And to your seed after you' means that He would give them to those who would have faith in Him. This is clear from the meaning of 'seed' as faith, dealt with in <a href="1025.htm">1025</a>, <a href="1447.htm">1447</a>, <a href="1610.htm">1610</a>, that is to say, the 
faith that is grounded in charity, dealt with in <a href="379.htm">379</a>, <a href="389.htm">389</a>, <a href="654.htm">654</a>, <a href="724.htm">724</a>, <a href="809.htm">809</a>, <a href="916.htm">916</a>, <a href="1017.htm">1017</a>, <a href="1162.htm">1162</a>, <a href="1176.htm">1176</a>, <a href="1258.htm">1258</a>. People who attach merit to the deeds they perform in life do not have the faith that is grounded 
in charity, and so are not those meant by 'the seed' here, for in so doing they do not wish to be saved by the Lord's righteousness but by their own. That no faith grounded in charity exists with them, 
that is, no charity, is clear from their habit of putting themselves before other people and so of having themselves in view and not other people, except insofar as the latter serve them. And those 
who are unwilling to serve them they either despise or hate. Thus through self-love they part company and never come together, and in this way they destroy that which is heavenly, namely mutual love, 
which is the mainstay of heaven. For it is in that love that heaven itself, and its whole companionship and harmony, continues to exist and consists. For whatever is destructive of the harmony existing 
in the next life is opposed to the order of heaven itself, and so contributes to the destruction of the whole. Such is the nature of people who attach merit to the deeds which they perform in life 
and lay claim to righteousness for themselves. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 There are many persons of this type in the next life. Sometimes their faces shine like torches, but this is because of the ignis fatuus that is the 
product of self-righteousness. They are in fact ice-cold. Sometimes they are seen running about and confirming self-merit from the literal sense of the Word, at the same time hating the truths that 
belong to the internal sense, <a href="1877.htm">1877</a>. The sphere emanating from them is one of self-regard, and so a sphere destructive of all ideas which do not regard self as some kind of deity. The sphere emanating 
from many such persons is at the same time so disruptive that nothing else than that which is hostile and antagonistic exists there, for when each has the same wish, namely to be served, he at heart slays 
every other. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Some of them are numbered among those who say that they have worked in the Lord's vineyard. During all that time however they had been turning over in their minds how to further 
their own reputation, glory, and honour, and also their own enrichment, even to the point of their becoming the greatest in heaven and being served even by angels. Since at heart they despise others 
in comparison with themselves, they have accordingly not been endowed with any mutual love in which heaven consists but with self-love which they identify with heaven, for they do not know what heaven 
is. Regarding these people, see <a href="450.htm">450</a>-<a href="452.htm">452</a>, <a href="1594.htm">1594</a>, <a href="1679.htm">1679</a>. They belong among those who wish to be first but become last, of whom the Lord speaks in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2019:30;%2020:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 19:30; 20:16</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2010:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 10:31</a>. They are also those who 
say that they have prophesied in the Lord's name and have done many mighty works, but of whom it is said, 'I do not know you', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:22,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:22, 23</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The situation is different with people who from simplicity 
of heart have assumed that they have merited heaven but who have led charitable lives and who have not been captivated by self-love and so despised others in comparison with themselves. They 
have looked upon meriting heaven as a promise, and they readily acknowledge that it is a matter of the Lord's mercy, for a charitable life implies such acknowledgement. Charity itself loves all truth. </p>

Quod `semini tuo post te' significet quod daturus illis qui fidem in Ipsum haberent, constat ex significatione `seminis' quod sit fides, de qua n. 1025, 1447, 1610; nempe quod sit fides charitatis, 
de qua n. 379, 389, 654, 724, 809, 916, 1017, 1162, 1176, (x)1258.  Fidem charitatis non habent, ita non sunt `semen' hic intellectum, qui meritum ponunt in suae vitae actis, sic enim non ex Domini justitia, 
sed ex suamet salvari volunt; quod in illis nulla sit fides charitatis, hoc est, nulla charitas, constat exinde quod semet aliis praeferant, (m)ita se intuentur non alios, nisi quantum illis serviunt, 
et qui non hoc volunt, illos vel contemnunt vel odio habent(n); ita {1} per amorem sui dissociant et nusquam sociant, et sic destruunt quod caeleste est, nempe amorem mutuum qui est firmamentum 
caeli, nam {2} in illo ipsum caelum, et omnis ejus consociatio et unanimitas subsistit et consistit; quicquid enim destruit unanimitatem in altera vita, hoc contra ordinem ipsius caeli est, ita ad 
destructionem totius conspirat; tales sunt qui in vitae suae actis ponunt meritum, et justitiam sibi vindicant: [2] ex his sunt plures in altera vita; ii quandoque lucent facie sicut faculae, sed ex igne 
fatuo qui prodit ex sui justificatione, sed sunt frigidi; visi quandoque discurrere et confirmare sui meritum ex sensu litterali Verbi, odio habentes vera quae sunt sensus interni, n. 1877; (m)sphaera 
eorum est intuitiva sui, ita destructiva omnium idearum quae se non intuentur {3} instar cujusdam numinis; sphaera plurium talium simul est distractiva ita ut nihil sit ibi nisi inimicum et hostile, 
nam quisque cum idem vult, nempe ut serviatur, alterum corde necat(n): [3] quidam eorum sunt inter eos qui dicunt se laboravisse in vinea Domini, cum tamen jugiter tunc volverunt animo sui praeeminentiam, 
gloriam, et honores, tum etiam lucrum, et sic usque quod maximi fierent in caelo, immo quod servirentur ab angelis; alios prae se corde contemnentes, ita nullo amore mutuo in quo caelum consistit, 
imbuti, sed amore sui in quo ponunt caelum, nam nesciunt quid caelum, de quibus videatur n. 450-452, 1594, 1679; (m)hi sunt inter illos qui primi esse volunt, sed fiunt ultimi, [de quibus Dominus,] 
Matth. xix 30; (x)xx 16; Marc. x 31; et qui dicunt se per nomen Domini prophetavisse et multas virtutes fecisse, at quibus dicitur `Non novi vos,' Matth. vii 22, 23 (n).  [4] Aliter se habet cum illis 
qui ex simplicitate cordis autumarunt se mereri caelum, et in charitate vixerunt, [nec amore sui capti alios prae se contempserunt;] illi mereri caelum spectarunt ut promissum, et fatue agnoscunt 
id misericordiae Domini esse; nam vita charitatis hoc secum habet; ipsa charitas omne verum amat. 	@1 et.$ 	@2 ita.$ 	@3 intueantur.$ </p>
