<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6880节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6880.</strong>“我是自有永有的”表宇宙万物的存在和彰显。这从以下事实清楚可知：“我自有”（I AM）是指存在；由于唯独祂是存在，故经上以“我自有”作为一个名字。“我自有”之所以出现两次，也就是说，“我自有永有”（I AM WHO I AM），是因为一个表示存在，另一个表示彰显。因此，一个表示被称为“父”的神性本身，另一个表示被称为“子”的神性人身；因为神性人身从神性本身彰显。但现在就其人身而言，主已变成神性存在，也就是耶和华了，那么从主的神性人身发出的神性真理就是由神性存在所产生的神性彰显。由此可见，神性存在若不通过神性彰显，就无法与任何人接触；也就是说，神性本身若不通过神性人身，就无法接触，而神性人身若不通过神性真理，也就是圣灵的神圣散发，就无法接触。这一点由约翰福音（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">1:3</a>）中的话来表示，即：万物都是藉着圣言造的。在人看来，神性真理似乎没有这种性质，即：任何事物都能通过它产生；因为人们以为它就像一种声音，从口唇发出后就随风飘散了。而事实完全不是这样。从主发出的神性真理才是某种实实在在的真实事物。这种事物具有这样的性质，一切事物皆从它产生，一切事物皆靠它保持存在；因为凡从主发出之物都是宇宙中最真实的事物。这就是神性真理的性质，神性真理被称为“圣言”，万物都是藉着神性真理或圣言造的。</p>

I AM WHO I AM. That this signifies the Being and Coming-forth of all things in the universe, is evident from the fact that "I AM" is Being, and because He alone is Being, it is said in the nominative 
case. That it is twice said "I AM," that is, "I AM WHO I AM," is because the one signifies Being and the other Coming-forth; thus the one signifies the Divine Itself, which is called the "Father," and 
the other the Divine Human, which is called the "Son;" for the Divine Human comes-forth from the Divine Itself. But when the Lord as to the Human also was made the Divine Being [Esse] or Jehovah, then 
the Divine truth, which proceeds from the Lord's Divine Human, is the Divine Coming-forth from the Divine Being. From this it can be seen that the Divine Being cannot communicate Itself to anyone except 
through the Divine Coming-forth; that is, the Divine Itself cannot communicate Itself except through the Divine Human, and the Divine Human can not communicate itself except through the Divine truth, 
which is the Holy of the Spirit: this is meant by its being said that all things were made by the Word (John 1:3). It appears to man as if the Divine truth were not such that anything can come forth 
by means of it; for it is believed that it is like a voice, which being uttered with the lips, is dissipated. But it is altogether otherwise; the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is the veriest 
reality, and such a reality that all things have come forth from it, and all things subsist from it; for whatever proceeds from the Lord is the veriest reality in the universe; and such is the Divine 
truth, which is called the "Word," through which all things were made. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6880</b></p><p><b>6880.</b>
'I Am Who I Am' means the Being and the Coming-into-Being of all things throughout creation. This is clear from the fact that 'I Am' means to have Being, and since He alone is Being 'I Am' is used as 
a name. The reason why 'I Am' occurs twice - that is to say, in 'I Am Who I Am' - is that in one place it means the Being and in the other the Coming-into-Being, Thus one means the Divine itself, which 
is called the Father, and the other means the Divine Human, which is called the Son; for the Divine Human comes into being from the Divine itself. But now that the Lord has become Divine Being, which 
is Jehovah, in respect of His Human too, Divine Truth which emanates from the Lord's Divine Human is the Divine Coming-into-Being arising from the Divine Being. From this it may be seen that the Divine 
Being cannot make contact with anyone except through the Divine Coming-into-Being; that is, the Divine itself cannot make contact except through the Divine Human, and the Divine Human cannot do so 
except through Divine Truth, which is the holy emanation of the spirit. This is implied by the words in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:7</a>, 'all things were made through the Word'. The appearance to man is that Divine Truth 
is not the kind of thing that can bring something into being; for it is thought to be like an utterance which is discharged from the mouth and scattered to the winds. But the reality is altogether different. 
Divine Truth emanating from the Lord is something very real indeed. Its nature is such that it is the source from which all things come into being and from which all things are kept in being; 
for what emanates from the Lord is the most real thing in the whole of creation. Such is the nature of Divine Truth, which is called 'the Word through which all things were made'. </p>

`Sum Qui Sum': quod significet Esse et Existere omnium in universo, constat ex eo quod `Sum' sit Esse, et quia est Solus Esse, {1}in nominativo dicitur; quod bis dicatur `Sum,' nempe `Sum Qui Sum,' 
est quia unum significat Esse et' alterum {2} Existere; ita unum significat Ipsum Divinum, quod Pater vocatur, alterum Divinum Humanum, quod Filius, nam Divinum Humanum existit (c)ab Ipso Divino; cum 
autem Dominus etiam quoad Humanum factus est Divinum Esse seu Jehovah, tunc Divinum Verum quod procedit a Divino Humano Domini est Divinum Existere ex Divino Esse; exinde constare potest quod Divinum 
Esse non possit se communicare alicui nisi per Divinum Existere, hoc est, Ipsum Divinum {3} nisi quam per Divinum Humanum, et Divinum Humanum {3} nisi quam per Divinum Verum, quod est sanctum spiritus; 
hoc intelligitur per quod `omnia per Verbum facta sint,' Joh. i 3.  Apparet homini sicut Divinum Verum non sit tale ut per illud existere aliquid possit; creditur enim quod sit sicut vox quae emissa 
ore dissipatur; sed prorsus aliter se habet; Divinum Verum procedens a Domino est ipsissimum reale, et tale ut inde (x)exstiterint omnia, et inde subsistant omnia, quicquid enim procedit a Domino est 
ipsissimum reale in universo {4}; tale est Divinum Verum, quod vocatur `Verbum per quod omnia facta sunt.' 	@1 After dicitur$ 	@2 i autem$ 	@3 i non$ 	@4 i, nam Dominus quoad Ipsum Divinum et quoad 
Divinum Humanum, est unicum Esse, seu unicum Essentiale, et quia unicum est, ex Ipso omnia et singula existunt$ </p>
