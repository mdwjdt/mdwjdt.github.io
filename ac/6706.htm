<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6706节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6706.</strong>教会成员应完全熟悉邻舍的不同种类，以便他能了解仁爱的真正性质；这些不同种类取决于存在于每个人里面的良善。由于一切良善皆从主发出，故主是至高意义和至高无上的邻舍；邻舍起源于祂。由此可知，人照着主与他同住的程度而为邻舍；由于没有哪两个人以相同的方式接受主，也就是接受从主发出的良善，故没有哪两个人以相同的方式成为邻舍。因为所有人，无论在天上的还是在地上的，无一例外，在良善上各不相同。同一种良善绝不会存在于两个人里面；它必然有所变化，好叫每种良善都能继续独立存在。但是，任何人，甚至连天使也不可能知道所有这些变化，因而知道由接受主，也就是接受从祂发出的良善的方式所决定的邻舍的一切区别，除非大体上知道，也就是知道它们的大体种类和其中一些具体种类。主只要求教会成员照他所知道的生活，没有过多要求。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6706</b></p><p><b>6706.</b>
The distinguishing differences of the neighbor, which the man of the church ought to wholly know, in order that he may know the quality of charity, vary in accordance with the good which is with everyone; 
and as all good proceeds from the Lord, the Lord is the neighbor in the highest sense, and in a surpassing degree; and from Him the neighbor originates. From this it follows that in proportion as 
anyone has of the Lord in him, in the same proportion he is the neighbor; and as no two persons receive the Lord (that is, receive the good which proceeds from Him) in the same way, therefore no two 
persons are the neighbor in the same way; for without exception all persons in the heavens and on earth differ in good. Precisely one and the same good never exists in two persons; it must vary in order 
for each person to subsist by himself. But all these varieties, thus all the distinguishing differences of the neighbor, which are according to the reception of the Lord, that is, of the good proceeding 
from Him, can never be known to any man, nor even to any angel, except in general, thus as to their genera and some species of these. Nor does the Lord require more of the man of the church than 
to live according to what he knows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6706</b></p><p><b>6706.</b>
The different kinds of neighbour - which a member of the Church ought to be thoroughly acquainted with if he is to know the true nature of charity - are determined by the good present in each individual. 
And since all good comes from the Lord, the Lord is in the highest sense and a supereminent degree the Neighbour and origin of the neighbour. From this it follows that a person is the neighbour in 
the measure Lord, that is, the good which comes from Him, in the same way as another, no one person is therefore the neighbour in the same way as another. For all without exception in heaven and all 
without exception on earth differ from one another in good. Good is never exactly one and the same with any two people; variation is essential, in order that each kind of good may continue to exist by 
itself. But no one, not even an angel, can know all those variations, thus all the distinctions of the neighbour that are determined by the way the Lord is received, that is, the good coming from Him. 
One can know them in only an overall way, that is, know the general kinds of variation and some of the specific kinds of these. Nor does the Lord demand anything more of a member of the Church than 
that he should lead a life in keeping with what he knows. </p>

</p><b>6706.</b>
Discrimina proximi, quae homo Ecclesiae omnino scire debet ut sciat quale charitatis, se habent secundum bonum quod est apud unumquemvis; et quia omne bonum procedit a Domino, est Dominus in supremo 
sensu ac in supereminente gradu Proximus a Quo origo; inde sequitur quod quantum Domini quisque apud se habet, tantum sit proximus, et quia nullus simili modo recipit Dominum, hoc est, bonum quod ab Ipso 
procedit, idcirco nec unus simili modo est proximus ac alter; omnes enim quicumque in caelis sunt et omnes quicumque in terris differunt bono; nusquam datur apud duos bonum prorsus unum et idem; varium 
erit ut unumquodvis per se subsistat. Sed omnia illa varia, ita omnia discrimina proximi quae se habent secundum receptionem Domini, hoc est, secundum receptionem boni ab Ipso procedentis, nusquam 
aliquis homo, ne quidem angelus, scire potest, sed modo in communi, ita generi et horum aliquot species; nec Dominus plus ab homine Ecclesiae requirit quam ut vivat secundum id quod scit. </p>
