<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于流注，以及身体与灵魂的相互作用（续）</h4><br />6598.众所周知，一个人比另一个人有更大的能力去理解并觉知何为个人生活中的高尚举止、公众生活中的正义，并寻求属灵生活中的良善。他拥有更大能力的原因在于以下事实：他的思维被提升至属于天堂的事物，由此退离外在感官层面。因为思维没有上升至感官层面之上的人不可能开始明白何为高尚、正义或良善；因此，他们仰赖其他人，所说的话大多出于记忆，他们由此觉得自己比其他人更智慧。但那些能在高于感官的一个层面进行思考的人，只要他们的记忆内容都处在秩序中，就会拥有比其他人更大的理解和觉知的能力。他们的能力取决于他们从内层事物看待事物的程度，或说取决于他们看待事物所站的内在立场的高度。</p>

Continuation about influx, and about the interaction of the soul and the body. It is known that one man excels another in the capacity to understand and perceive what is honorable in moral life, what 
is just in civil life, and what is good in spiritual life. The cause of this consists in the elevation of the thought to the things that pertain to heaven, whereby the thought is withdrawn from the 
external things of sense; for they who think solely from things of sense cannot see one whit of what is honorable, just, and good, and therefore they trust to others and speak much from the memory, and 
thereby appear to themselves wiser than others. But they who are able to think above the things of sense, provided the things in the memory have been set in order, possess a greater capacity than others 
to understand and perceive, and this according to the degree in which they view things from what is interior. </p>

INFLUX AND THE INTERACTION OF SOUL AND BODY - continued </p>
<p>It is well known that one person is endowed with a greater ability than another to understand and perceive what it is to behave honourably in 
private life, to be upright in public life, and to seek what is good in one's spiritual life. The reason why he has that greater ability lies in the fact that his thought has been raised towards the 
things of heaven and is consequently drawn away from the level of the external senses. For people whose thought does not rise above the level of the senses cannot begin to see what is honourable, upright, 
or good. They therefore rely on what others think, and base most of what they say on matters stored in the memory, and in doing this seem to themselves to be wiser than others. But those who can 
think on a level above the senses possess, if the contents of their memory are all in order, a greater ability than others to understand and perceive. Their ability depends on the height of the interior 
standpoint from which they look at things. </p>

Continuatio de Influxu et de Commercio animae et corporis </p>
<p>Notum est quod unus homo prae altero polleat facultate intelligendi et percipiendi quid honestum in vita morali, quid justum in vita civili, 
et quid bonum in vita spirituali; causa consistit in elevatione cogitationis ad illa quae caeli sunt, inde abducitur cogitatio {1} sensualibus externis; qui enim ex sensualibus solum cogitant, ne 
hilum possunt videre quid honestum, justum et bonum; {2}quare fidunt aliis, et {3}ex memoria multum loquuntur, et per hoc sibi apparent aliis sapientiores; qui autem supra sensualia cogitare possunt, 
si ordinata sunt illa quae in memoria, in facultate intelligendi et percipiendi prae aliis sunt, et hoc secundum gradum intuitionis ab interiore. @1 i ab externis et$ @2 et$ @3 inde$ </p>
