<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5952节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5952.</strong>“约瑟照着法老的吩咐给他们车辆”表他们从内在领受似乎令他们喜悦的教义事物。这从约瑟的代表，以及“车辆”和“照着法老的吩咐”的含义清楚可知：约瑟，即“给”车辆的人，是指内在良善，如前所述；“车辆”是指教义事物（参看<a href="5945.htm">5945</a>节）；“照着法老的吩咐”是指似乎令他们，也就是属灵真理，即以色列的儿子们喜悦，因为这些真理在“法老”所代表的属世层里面（<a href="5160.htm">5160</a>，<a href="5799.htm">5799</a>节），而表示教义事物的车辆则由他们支配。之所以说“似乎令他们喜悦”，是因为“埃及的车辆”所表示的教义事物是从圣言的字义获得的（<a href="5945.htm">5945</a>节）；而圣言的字义没有内义也能运用于任何一种良善。因为主并不公开教导任何人真理，而是通过良善引导思考何为真理，还在人不知不觉的情况下赋予他一种洞察力和随之对这一观点的采纳：这事是真的，因为圣言就是如此宣称的，还因为它与圣言一致。因此，主照着各人对良善的接受而调整真理。由于祂所行的这一切取决于各人的情感，是在自由中成就的，所以我们说“似乎令他们喜悦”。</p>

And [Joseph] gave them carts, according to the mouth of Pharaoh. That this signifies that from the internal they had doctrinal things as was pleasing, is evident from the representation of Joseph, who 
is he that "gave," as being internal good (of which above); from the signification of "carts," as being doctrinal things (see n. 5945); and from the signification of "according to the mouth of Pharaoh," 
as being as was pleasing, namely, to spiritual truths, which are the sons of Israel; because these truths are in the natural which is represented by Pharaoh (n. 5160, 5799), and the carts, by which 
are signified doctrinal things, were placed at their disposal. It is said "as was pleasing," because the doctrinal things which are signified by the "carts of Egypt" are from the literal sense of the 
Word (n. 5945), which without the internal sense can be applied to any good whatever. For the Lord does not openly teach anyone truths, but through good leads to the thinking of what is true, and unknown 
to the man He also inspires the perception and consequent choice that such a thing is true because the Word so declares, and because it accords therewith. Thus the Lord adapts truths according 
to the reception of good by each person; and as this takes place according to each person's affection, thus in freedom, it is here said "as was pleasing." </p>

'And he gave them carts, according to Pharaoh's command' means that from the internal they received matters of doctrine, as seemed pleasing to them. This is clear from the representation of Joseph, the 
one who 'gave' the carts, as internal good, dealt with already; from the meaning of 'carts' as matters of doctrine, dealt with above in <a href="5945.htm">5945</a>; and from the meaning of 'according to Pharaoh's command' 
as what seemed pleasing to them - to spiritual truths, which are 'the sons of Israel' - for those truths are within the natural, which is represented by 'Pharaoh', <a href="5160.htm">5160</a>, <a href="5799.htm">5799</a>, and 'the carts', meaning 
matters of doctrine, were placed at their disposal. The expression 'as seemed pleasing to them' is used because the matters of doctrine that are meant by the Egyptian 'carts' are obtained from the 
literal sense of the Word, <a href="5945.htm">5945</a>. Which without the internal sense can be applied to any kind of good. For the Lord does not openly teach anyone truths but leads him by means of good to think what the 
truth is, and also imparts to the person, though he is not aware of it, a discernment and consequent adoption of a thing as being true because the Word declares it to be so, and because it squares with 
the Word. Thus the Lord adapts truths to accord with the individual's acceptance of good. And since all this is done by Him in accordance with each person's affection, thus in his freedom, the expression 
'as seemed pleasing to them' is used. </p>

`Et dedit illis {1} vehicula juxta os Pharaonis': quod significet quod ab interno doctrinalia, sicut placuit, constat ex  repraesentatione `Josephi' qui est is qui `dedit' {2} quod sit bonum internum, 
de qua prius; ex significatione `vehiculorum' quod sint doctrinalia, de qua supra n. 5945; et ex significatione `juxta os Pharaonis' quod sit sicut placuit, nempe veris spiritualibus quae sunt `filii 
 Israelis', quia haec vera (t)sunt in naturali'  quod per `Pharaonem' repraesentatur, n. (x)5160, 5799, et {3}'vehicula' per quae doctrinalia significantur, data sunt illis ad dispositionem. (s)Sicut 
placuit, dicitur quia doctrinalia quae per `vehicula Aegypti' significantur, sunt ex sensu litterali Verbi, n. 5945, qui absque sensu interno applicari potest cuique bono; Dominus enim non aliquem 
aperte docet vera sed per bonum ducit ad cogitandum quid verum, et quoque inspirat, homine nesciente, apperceptionem  et inde electionem quod hoc verum sit quia ita dictat Verbum, et quia hoc quadrat; 
ita Dominus aptat vera secundum receptionem boni ab unoquovis; hoc quia fit secundum cujusvis affectionem, ac ita in libero, dicitur hic, sicut placuit.(s) @1 See p. 384, ftnote 1$ @2 i illis vehicula$ @3
