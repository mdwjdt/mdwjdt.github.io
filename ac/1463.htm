<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1463节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1463.</strong>“寄居”表接受教导。这从圣言中“寄居”表接受教导的含义清楚可知，之所以有这样的含义，是因为在天堂，寄居和迁移，或从一个地方挪到另一个地方，无非是状态的变化，如前所示（<a href="1376.htm">1376</a>，<a href="1379.htm">1379</a>节）。因此，每当旅居、寄居，或从一个地方迁移到另一个地方出现在圣言中，天使只会想到诸如他们所具有的状态的变化，既有思维状态的变化，也有情感状态的变化。思维状态的变化是认知，在灵人界，这些变化表现为教导。这也解释了为何与天使天堂相联的上古教会成员并未感觉“寄居”表其它事物。故此处经上所说“亚伯兰就下埃及去，要寄居在那里”无非表示主被教导。<br />雅各和他儿子们下到埃及具有相同的含义，如以赛亚书：<br />主耶和华如此说，起先我的百姓下到埃及，在那里寄居，又有亚述人无故欺压他们。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛52.4.htm">52:4</a>）<br />此处“亚述”表推理。这也是为何在犹太教会，接受教导的人被称为“寄居在你们中间的外人”，他们和本地人同归一例，同等对待（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.48.htm">12:48</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.49.htm">49</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利24.22.htm">24:22</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.13.htm">15:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.29.htm">29</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民19.10.htm">19:10</a>）。关于寄居的外人，以西结书上说：<br />你们要按着以色列的支派彼此分这地。要拈阄分这地为业，归与自己和你们中间寄居的外人。你们要看他们如同以色列人中的本地人一样，他们在以色列支派中要与你们同得地业。外人寄居在哪支派中，你们就在那里分给他地业。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.21.htm">47:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.23.htm">23</a>）<br />这论及新耶路撒冷，或主的国。“寄居的外人”用来表允许自己接受教导的人，因而表外邦人。“外人”表正接受教导的人，这从以下事实清楚可知，即经上说“外人寄居在哪支派中，你们就在那里分给他地业”。“支派”表构成信的事物。<br />“寄居”的含义还与“旅居”和“居住”的相似。“旅居”表所建立的生活模式和秩序，而“居住”表生活，这二者前面都已论述过（<a href="1293.htm">1293</a>节）。由于同样的原因，迦南地还被称为“亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各所寄居的地”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创28.4.htm">28:4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创36.7.htm">36:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创37.1.htm">37:1</a>；出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出6.4.htm">6:4</a>）。雅各对法老说：<br />我寄居在世的年日是一百三十岁，我平生的年日又少又苦，不及我列祖在世寄居的年日。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创47.9.htm">47:9</a>）<br />此处“寄居”表生活和教导。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1463.</strong> The fact that residing as an immigrant means being taught can be seen from the symbolism of immigrating in the Word as being taught. This symbolism comes about because in heaven, residing in a foreign land and immigrating 钬?in other words, moving from one place to another 钬?is simply a change in condition, as shown earlier (搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1376" target=_top>1376</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1379" target=_top>1379</a>). So every time the Word speaks of traveling, immigrating, or moving from place to place, the one thing that comes to an angel's mind is the kind of change in condition that angels experience. Changes of state can be either changes in one's way of thinking or changes in one's feelings. Changes in the state of one's thinking are new concepts. In the world of spirits, these changes result from instruction,{*1} and since the people of the earliest church were in contact with heaven and its angels, a consequence was that traveling meant exactly that to them. So here the fact that Abram went down into Egypt to reside as an immigrant does indeed symbolize instruction of the Lord.<br />[2] The journey of Jacob and his offspring into Egypt means much the same. In Isaiah, for instance:<br />This is what the Lord Jehovih has said: "My people went down to Egypt in the beginning to stay as immigrants, and Assyria for no reason oppressed them." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_52_4" target=_top>Isaiah 52:4</a>)<br />Assyria here stands for specious logic.<br />In the Jewish church, for the same reason, people who were being taught were called immigrants residing in their midst, and by command they were to be treated the same as the native-born (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_exodus_12_48-49" target=_top>Exodus 12:48-49</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_24_22" target=_top>Leviticus 24:22</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_numbers_15_13" target=_top>Numbers 15:13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_numbers_15_14" target=_top>14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_numbers_15_15" target=_top>15</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_numbers_15_16" target=_top>16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_numbers_15_26" target=_top>26</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_numbers_15_29" target=_top>29</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_numbers_19_10" target=_top>19:10</a>). Ezekiel speaks of them this way:<br />You shall divide this land for yourselves according to the tribes of Israel. And it will happen that you shall divide it by lot as an inheritance for yourselves and for the immigrants residing in your midst, and they shall be to you as the native-born among the children of Israel. Along with you they shall cast a lot for an inheritance in the middle of the tribes of Israel. And it will happen that, in the tribe that an immigrant is residing with, there you shall give [the immigrant] an inheritance. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_47_21" target=_top>Ezekiel 47:21</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_47_22" target=_top>22</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_47_23" target=_top>23</a>)<br />This is about a new Jerusalem, or the Lord's kingdom. The immigrants residing in the land mean people who allow themselves to be instructed, and consequently they mean religious outsiders.{*2} Evidence that immigrants stand for people who are being taught may be seen in the statement that whatever tribe an immigrant was living with, that was where the immigrant was to receive an inheritance; tribes stand for tenets of the true faith.<br />[3] Immigrating also has the same symbolism as traveling and settling. Traveling symbolizes the customs and pattern of a life, while settling somewhere symbolizes living one's life, as mentioned earlier, in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1293" target=_top>1293</a>. So the land of Canaan is also referred to as the land of Abraham's, Isaac's, and Jacob's travels (in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_genesis_28_4" target=_top>Genesis 28:4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_genesis_36_7" target=_top>36:7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_genesis_37_1" target=_top>37:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_exodus_6_4" target=_top>Exodus 6:4</a>). And Jacob said to Pharaoh:<br />The days of the years of my travels: Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not overtaken the days of the years of the life of my forebears, in the days of their travels. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/bible_king-james-version_genesis_47_9" target=_top>Genesis 47:9</a>)<br />Travels here stand for the way we live and what we are taught.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For more on the moral and spiritual instruction that produces these "changes in the state of one's thinking," see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1463/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_512" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 512-520</a>.

[RS]<br />{*2} "Religious outsiders" represents the Latin word gentes here. Elsewhere in this translation and this edition the word is often rendered "nations," by which Swedenborg generally means anyone who is outside a given "church." In the present context, he may be referring to non-Christians. [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1463</b></p><p><b>1463.</b>
That "to sojourn" means to be instructed, is evident from the signification of "sojourning" in the Word, as being to be instructed; and this for the reason that sojourning and migration, or proceeding 
from place to place, is in heaven nothing but change of state, as before shown (n. 1376, 1379); and therefore, whenever traveling, sojourning, and passing from place to place, occur in the Word, nothing 
else is suggested to the angels than such change of state as exists with them. There are changes of state of both the thoughts and the affections; changes of the state of the thoughts are knowledges, 
and in the world of spirits these changes are presented by means of instructions; which also was the reason why the men of the Most Ancient Church, having communication with the angelic heaven, by 
sojourning perceived nothing else. So in the passage before us, Abram's going down into Egypt to sojourn, signifies nothing else than the instruction of the Lord.  [2] Similar, too, is the signification 
of Jacob and his sons' going down into Egypt; as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thus hath said the Lord Jehovih, My people went down in the beginning into Egypt to sojourn there; and Assyria oppressed them without 
cause (Isa. 52:4); </p>
<p>where "Assyria" denotes reasonings. Hence also in the Jewish Church, those who were being instructed were called "sojourners, sojourning in the midst of them," concerning whom 
it was commanded that they should be treated as the homeborn (Exod. 12:48-49; Lev. 24:22; Num. 15:13-16, 26, 29; 19:10). Of them it is thus written in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Ye shall divide this land unto you 
according to the tribes of Israel. And it shall come to pass that ye shall divide it by lot, for an inheritance unto you and to the sojourners that sojourn in the midst of you; and they shall be unto 
you as the homeborn among the sons of Israel; with you shall they cast the lot for an inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel; and it shall come to pass that in what tribe the sojourner sojourneth, 
there shall ye give him his inheritance (Ezek. 47:21-23). This is concerning the New Jerusalem, or the Lord's kingdom; by "the sojourners sojourning" are meant those who suffer themselves to 
be instructed, consequently the Gentiles; that those are meant who are being instructed, is evident from its being said that in the tribe with which he has sojourned, there his inheritance should be 
given; "tribes" denote the things that are of faith.  [3] "Sojourning" has also nearly the same signification as "journeying," and "dwelling." By "journeying" are signified the arrangements and order 
of life, and by "dwelling" is signified to live (see above, n. 1293); on which account the land of Canaan is also called the land of the sojournings of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Gen. 28:4; 36:7; 37:1; 
Exod. 6:4); and Jacob said unto Pharaoh: </p>
<p>     The days of the years of my sojournings, few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained unto the days of the years 
of the life of my fathers, in the days of their sojournings (Gen. 47:9); </p>
<p>where "sojourning" denotes life and instructions. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1463</b></p><p><b>1463.</b>
That 'sojourning' means receiving instruction becomes clear from the meaning in the Word of 'sojourning' as receiving instruction, and it has this meaning because sojourning and passing on, or moving 
from one place to another, is in heaven nothing else than a change of state, as shown already in <a href="1376.htm">1376</a>, <a href="1379.htm">1379</a>. Therefore every time travelling, sojourning, or transferring from one place to another occurs 
in the Word nothing else suggests itself to angels than a change of state such as takes place with them. There are changes of state both of thoughts and of affections. Changes of the state of thoughts 
are cognitions, which in the world of spirits are represented by means of forms of instruction. This also explains why members of the Most Ancient Church, having communication with the angelic heaven, 
did not perceive anything else by 'sojourning'. Thus the statement here that 'Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn' does not mean anything other than the Lord's being instructed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Something 
similar is meant by Jacob and his sons going down into Egypt, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said the Lord Jehovih, My people went down to Egypt at first to sojourn there, and Asshur oppressed them without 
cause. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2052:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 52:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Asshur' stands for reasonings. This is also why in the Jewish Church people who were receiving instruction were called 'sojourners, sojourning in their midst' who, it was commanded, 
were to receive the same treatment as the native-born, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2012:48,%2049&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 12:48, 49</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2024:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 24:22</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2015:13-16,%2026,%2029;%2019:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 15:13-16, 26, 29; 19:10</a>. Regarding sojourners it is said in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall divide this land among 
you according to the tribes of Israel. You shall divide it by lot as an inheritance for yourselves and for sojourners, sojourning in your midst. They shall be to you as native-born among the children 
of Israel, they shall cast lots with you for an inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel. In the tribe with which the sojourner has sojourned, there shall you give him his inheritance. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2047:21-23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 47:21-23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the new Jerusalem, or the Lord's kingdom. 'Sojourners sojourning' is used to mean people who allow themselves to receive instruction, consequently the gentiles. That 'sojourners' 
stands for people who are receiving instruction is clear from the fact that it is said 'in the tribe with which he has sojourned, there shall an inheritance be given him'. 'Tribes' stands for 
the things that constitute faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 'Sojourning' is also similar in meaning to travelling and dwelling. 'Travelling' means the established patterns and order of life, while 'dwelling' means living, 
both dealt with already in <a href="1293.htm">1293</a>. For the same reasons the land of Canaan is also called 'the land of the sojournings of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob', in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2028:4;%2036:7;%2037:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 28:4; 36:7; 37:1</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%206:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 6:4</a>. And Jacob said 
to Pharaoh, </p>
<blockquote>
The days of the years of my sojournings; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the 
days of their sojournings. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2047:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 47:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'sojourning' stands for life and for forms of instruction. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1463</b>
</p><b>1463.</b>
Quod 'peregrinari' sit instrui, constare potest ex significatione 'peregrinari' in Verbo quod sit instrui, et hoc ex causa quia peregrinatio et migratio, seu processio a loco in locum in caelo non aliud 
sit quam mutatio status, ut ostensum prius n. 1376, 1379; quare quoties in Verbo occurrit profectio, peregrinatio, et translatio a loco in locum, non aliud obvenit angelis quam talis mutatio status 
quae apud eos; mutationes status sunt tam cogitationum quam affectionum: mutationes status cogitationum sunt cognitiones, quae in mundo spirituum sistuntur per instructiones, quae causa quoque fuit 
quod Antiquissimae Ecclesiae homines, quia communicationem habebant cum caelo angelico, per 'peregrinationem' nec aliud perciperent; ita hic 'quod Abram descenderit in Aegyptum ad peregrinandum' nihil 
aliud significat quam instructionem Domini; [2] similiter per quod Jacobus et filii ejus in Aegyptum, ut apud Esaiam, 	Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Aegyptum descendit populus Meus in principio ad peregrinandum, 
et Asshur pro nihilo oppressit illum, lii 4; </p>
<p>ubi 'Asshur' pro ratiociniis: inde quoque illi qui instruebantur in Ecclesia Judaica, dicti fuerunt peregrini peregrinantes in medio illorum, 
de quibus mandatum ut similiter haberentur sicut indigenae, Exod. xii 48, 49; Lev. xxiv 22; Num. xv 13-16, 26, 29; xix 10, de quibus apud Ezechielem, 	Dividetis terram hanc vobis juxta tribus Israelis, 
et erit, juxta sortem dividetis illam hereditatem vobis et peregrinis peregrinantibus in medio vestri.... et erunt vobis sicut indigena in filiis Israelis, vobiscum sortem jacient in hereditatem in 
medio tribuum Israelis, et erit, in tribu cum qua peregrinus peregrinatus est cum illa, ibi dabitis hereditatem (x)illius, xlvii [21], 22, 23; </p>
<p>ubi de Nova Hierosolyma seu de regno Domini; per 'peregrinos 
peregrinantes' intelliguntur illi qui patiuntur se instrui, proinde gentes; quod pro illis qui instruuntur, constat ex eo quod dicatur 'in tribu, cum qua peregrinatus est, ibi daretur hereditas'; 
'tribus' pro illis quae sunt fidei.  [3] Per 'peregrinari' etiam simile quid significatur ac per proficisci et habitare, per 'proficisci' vitae instituta et ordo, perque 'habitare' vivere, de quibus 
prius n. 1293; quare etiam terra Canaan dicitur 'terra peregrinationum Abrahami, Isaci et Jacobi,' Gen. xxviii 4; xxxvi 7; xxxvii 1; Exod. vi 4; et Jacob dixit ad Pharaonem, 	Dies annorum peregrinationum, 
mearum, parum et mali fuerunt dies annorum vitae meae, et non attigerunt dies annorum vitae patrum meorum, in diebus peregrinationum illorum, Gen. xlvii 9; </p>
<p>ubi 'peregrinatio' pro vita et instructionibus. </p>
