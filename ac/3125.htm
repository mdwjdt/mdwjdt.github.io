<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3125节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3125.</strong>前文论述了对要与良善在理性中联结的真理的调查，即调查它的纯真、仁爱和起源。由于主凭自己的能力既在良善方面也在真理方面，使祂的理性变成神性，故祂调查了祂联结到良善的真理。然而，对人而言，真理能与良善联结绝不是凭他自己的能力，而是凭主的能力。这从以下事实可以看出来：一切善与真皆从主流入，整个改造和重生也都来自祂，人根本就不知道自己如何在重生。如今，人甚至不知道他藉由真理与良善重生，更不知道真理被引入良善，与其联结，并且这一切可以说通过调查，也就是以最精确的方式实现。这两节论述了对真理的性质和起源的直觉，同时论述了缘于它的欢喜。故接下来论述引入。 </p>

The foregoing verses treat of the exploration of the truth which was to be conjoined with good in the rational, in regard to innocence, to charity, and to origin. For inasmuch as the Lord, by His own 
proper power, made His rational Divine in respect to truth as well as in respect to good, He therefore explored the truth which He conjoined with good. But with men, truth is never conjoined with good 
by their own power, but by the power of the Lord; which may be seen from the fact that all good and truth flow in from the Lord, and that all reformation and regeneration are from the Lord, and that 
man does not know one whit of how he is regenerated.  At the present day he does not even know that he is regenerated by truth and good, still less that truth is initiated and conjoined with good, and 
that this is effected as by exploration, that is, most exactly. These two verses treat of perception in regard to the quality of truth, and whence it was; and at the same time of joy because of it. 
Therefore in what now follows the initiation is treated of. </p>

Previous verses dealt with the investigation of truth that was to be joined to good in the Rational, as regards its innocence, charity, and origin. For since by His own power the Lord made His Rational 
Divine as regards good as well as regards truth, He consequently investigated the truth which He joined to good. With men however truth is never joined to good by means of their own power but by means 
of the Lord's. This becomes evident from the considerations that all good and truth flow in from the Lord, that the whole of reformation and regeneration is from Him, and that man does not know at 
all how he is being regenerated. At the present day man does not even know that he is regenerated by means of truth and good, let alone that truth is introduced into and joined to good, and that this 
is effected so to speak by investigation, that is, with very great precision. These two verses have dealt with perception of the nature and origin of truth, and at the same time with joy on that account. 
What follows next therefore deals with the introduction. </p>

In illis quae praecedunt, actum est de exploratione veri quod conjungendum bono in rationali, quoad innocentiam, quoad charitatem, et quoad originem; nam quoniam Dominus Suum Rationale ex propria potentia 
Divinum fecit, sicut quoad bonum ita quoad verum, idcirco Ipse exploravit verum, quod conjunxit bono: apud homines autem verum conjungitur bono nusquam ex propria, sed ex Domini potentia; quod 
evidens (t)potest esse ex eo quod omne bonum et verum influat a Domino, quodque omnis reformatio et regeneratio sit a Domino, et quod homo ne hilum sciat quomodo regeneratur; `hodie ne quidem' quod regeneretur 
per (t)verum et bonum, minus quod bono initietur et conjungatur verum, et hoc fiat quasi exploratione, hoc est, exactissime: in his binis versibus actum est de perceptione, quale et unde esset 
verum, et simul de gaudio propter id; ideo in nunc sequentibus agitur de initiatione. </p>
