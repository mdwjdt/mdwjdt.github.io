<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9499节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9499.</strong>“柜两侧的”表在最外层。这从“柜两侧”的含义清楚可知。“柜两侧”是指在最外层包围天堂的神性气场；因为“两侧”是指边界，在此是指天堂的边界。不过，天堂里的最外层和边界不同于世上的最外层和边界，因为在世上，它们和空间有关；而在天堂，它们和与真理结合的良善有关。与神性真理结合的神性良善，作为天堂的最外层、边界、范围和容器，可比作世上在人周围流动的空气带，这空气带将他的整个体表都牢牢联结在一起，以防止它分崩离析。但在世上，如此行的力量是属世的，它作用于人的身体，如同作用于物质材料；而在天堂，是来自主的神性属天层和神性属灵层在一位天使周围运作，将他保持在他所拥有的形式和能力中。</p>

On the sides of the ark. That this signifies in ultimates, is evident from the signification of "the sides of the ark," as being the Divine sphere that encompasses heaven in its ultimates; for "the sides" 
denote the boundaries, here, those of heaven. But the ultimates and boundaries in heaven differ from those in the world in this respect, that in the world they are such relatively to spaces, but 
in heaven relatively to goods conjoined with truths. The Divine good conjoined with the Divine truth, which is the ultimate of heaven, and by which it is bounded, enclosed, and held together, is comparatively 
as is the atmosphere in the world, which flows around man and holds together all the surface of his body in its connection, so as to prevent its dissolution; but in the world that which does 
this is natural, and operates on the human body as on what is material; whereas in heaven it is the Divine celestial and the Divine spiritual from the Lord which operates around an angel, and holds him 
together in his form and power. </p>

'On the sides of the ark' means in the outermost parts. This is clear from the meaning of 'the sides of the ark' as the Divine sphere surrounding heaven in the outermost parts, for sides are borders, 
in this instance the borders of heaven. But outermost parts and borders in heaven are different from outermost parts and borders in the world, in that in the world they have to do with things that are 
spatial, but in heaven they have to do with forms of good joined to truths. Divine Good joined to Divine Truth, which serves as the outermost part, border, confiner, and container of heaven may be compared 
to the belt of air in the world which flows around a person, holding the entire surface of his body firmly together, so that it does not fall apart. But in the world it is a natural force which 
does this, acting on the human body since this is material, whereas in heaven it is the Divine Celestial and the Divine Spiritual from the Lord which acts around an angel, preserving him in the form 
and in the power he has.  </p>

</p><b>9499.</b>
`Super lateribus arcae': quod significet in ultimis, constat ex significatione `laterum arcae' quod sit sphaera Divina circumdans caelum in ultimis, nam latera sunt terminationes, hic terminationes 
caeli. Sed ultima ac terminationes in caelo {1}differunt ab ultimis et terminationibus in mundo in eo quod in mundo sint illa respective ad spatia, at in caelo respective ad bona conjuncta veris; Divinum 
Bonum conjunctum Divino Vero, quod est ultimum, terminans, concludens, et continens caeli, est comparative {2}ut atmosphaera in mundo quae circum hominem fluit et continet omnem corporis ejus superficiem 
in suo nexu {3}, ne diffluat; sed in mundo est naturale quod id facit, et operatur in corpus humanum, quatenus materiale, at in caelo est Divinum Caeleste et Divinum Spirituale a Domino (m)quod 
circum angelum operatur, ac illum in sua forma (c)et potentia continet.(n) @1 non sunt sicut ultima et terminationes in mundo, in mundo dicuntur ultima et terminationes$ @2 sicut$ @3 i et consistentia$ </p>
