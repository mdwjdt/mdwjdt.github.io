<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10509节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10509</strong>.“只是在我追讨的日子，我必追讨他们的罪”表当审判发生时，他们最后的状态，无论具体还是总体。这从“追讨的日子”和“追讨罪”的含义清楚可知：“追讨的日子”是指教会的最后状态，无论具体还是总体（<a href="2242.htm">2242</a>，<a href="6588.htm">6588</a>节）；“追讨罪”是指审判和定罪。之所以说“无论具体还是总体”，是因为具体的每个人在死亡进入来世时，都有一个“追讨的日子”。总体的教会在结束时也有这样一个日子。这时，人们会接受品质的检查和彼此的分离。那些陷入邪恶的人被投入地狱，那些处于良善的人被提升到天堂。然而，这一切不是发生在地上，而是发生在来世。至于这种检查和分离在那里是如何实现的，以及如何定罪和投入地狱，又如何提升到天堂，蒙主的神性怜悯，这一切将在别处阐明。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10509</b></p><p><b>10509.</b>
And in the day of My visitation I will visit their sin upon them. That this signifies their last state in particular and in general, when is the Judgment, is evident from the signification of "the day 
of visitation," as being the last state of the church in particular and in general (n. 2242, 6588); and from the signification of "visiting sin," as being to be judged and condemned. It is said "in 
particular and in general," because the day of visitation to everyone, thus in particular, is when he comes into the other life, which is when he dies, and it is also to the church in general when the 
church ceases to be. Then all are explored in respect to their quality, and are separated, those who are in evils being cast down into hell, and those who are in goods being raised into heaven. This 
however is not effected on earth, but in the other life. But how the exploration is accomplished there, and how the separation, and also how the condemnation and the casting down into hell, and the raising 
into heaven, shall of the Lord's Divine mercy be told elsewhere. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10509</b></p><p><b>10509.</b>
'And on the day of My visitation I will visit their sin upon them' means their final state in particular and in general, when judgement takes place. This is clear from the meaning of 'the day of visitation' 
as the final state of the Church in particular and in general, dealt with in <a href="2242.htm">2242</a>, <a href="6588.htm">6588</a>; and from the meaning of 'visiting sin' as being judged and condemned. The words in particular and in general 
are used because there is 'a day of visitation' for each person in particular when he enters the next life, as happens when he dies. There is also such a day for the Church in general when it comes 
to an end. At that time people undergo examination of their characters and separation from one another. Those ruled by evils are cast down to hell and those governed by forms of good are raised to 
heaven. This does not take place on earth however, but in the next life. But how that examination and separation are accomplished there, also the condemnation and casting down to hell and the raising 
to heaven, will in the Lord's Divine mercy be stated elsewhere<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>.

</p><b>10509.</b>
`Et in die visitationis Meae visitabo super illos peccatum eorum': quod significet statum eorum ultimum in particulari et in communi quando judicium, constat ex significatione `diei visitationis' quod 
sit status ultimus Ecclesiae in particulari et in communi, de qua n. 2242, 6588, et ex significatione `visitare peccatum' quod sit judicari et damnari; dicitur in particulari et in communi quia dies 
visitationis est unicuique, (o)ita in particulari, cum in alteram vitam venit, quod fit cum moritur {1}; et quoque est Ecclesiae in communi, cum haec desinit esse; explorantur tunc quales sunt, ac separantur; 
qui in malis sunt dejiciuntur in infernum, et qui in bonis, {2} elevantur in caelum,verum hoc non fit in terra sed in altera vita; sed quomodo ibi exploratio fit et quomodo separatio, tum quomodo 
damnatio et dejectio in infernum, ac elevatio in caelum, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, alibi dicetur. {3} </p>
