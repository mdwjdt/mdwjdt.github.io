<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8432节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8432.</strong>“早晨必给你们食物得饱”表一个新状态开始时他们将拥有如他们所能领受的那样多的良善。这从“食物”、“早晨”和“得饱”的含义清楚可知：“食物”是指爱之良善（<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="3464.htm">3464</a>，<a href="3478.htm">3478</a>，<a href="3735.htm">3735</a>，<a href="3813.htm">3813</a>，<a href="4211.htm">4211</a>，<a href="4217.htm">4217</a>，<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="5915.htm">5915</a>，<a href="8410.htm">8410</a>节），但在此是指真理之良善，也就是属灵教会的良善，因为“食物”表示吗哪，如下文所述；“早晨”是指一个新状态的开始（参看<a href="8427.htm">8427</a>节）；“得饱”是指如他们想要的那么多（<a href="8410.htm">8410</a>节），在此是指如他们所能接受的那么多，因为从主流入的良善不是按照人们想要的那个量，而是按他们所能领受的那个量被赐予。但至于邪恶，他们想要多少，就可以拥有多少。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8432</b></p><p><b>8432.</b>
And in the morning bread to satiety. That this signifies that in the beginning of a new state they shall have as much good as they can receive, is evident from the signification of "bread," as being 
the good of love (n. 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735, 4976, 5915, 8410), but here the good of truth, which is the good of the spiritual church, because by "bread" is meant the manna 
(of which in what follows); from the signification of "the morning," as being the beginning of a new state (see above, n. 8427); and from the signification of "to satiety," which means as much as they 
desired (n. 8410), here as much as they could receive; for the good which flows in from the Lord is not given as much as men desire, but as much as they can receive; whereas evil is allowed as much 
as they desire. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8432</b></p><p><b>8432.</b>
'And in the morning bread to the full' means that at the beginning of a new state they will have as much good as they can receive. This is clear from the meaning of 'bread' as the good of love, dealt 
with in <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="3464.htm">3464</a>, <a href="3478.htm">3478</a>, <a href="3735.htm">3735</a>, <a href="3813.htm">3813</a>, <a href="4211.htm">4211</a>, <a href="4217.htm">4217</a>, <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="5915.htm">5915</a>, <a href="8410.htm">8410</a>, but at this point the good of truth, which is the spiritual Church's good since 'bread' is used to mean the manna, dealt 
with below; from the meaning of 'the morning' as the beginning of a new state, as above in <a href="8427.htm">8427</a>; and from the meaning of 'to the full' as, as much as they might wish to have, dealt with above in <a href="8410.htm">8410</a>, 
at this point as much as they could receive, since good that flows in from the Lord is not imparted in the measure that people wish but in the measure that they can receive it. But they are allowed 
as much evil as they wish to have. </p>

</p><b>8432.</b>
`Et panem in matuta ad satiandum': quod significet quod in principio status novi habebitur bonum quantum recipere possunt, constat ex significatione `panis' quod sit bonum amoris, de qua n. 2165, 2177, 
3464, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735, 4976, 5915, 8410, hic autem bonum veri, quod est bonum Ecclesiae spiritualis, quia per panem intelligitur manna, de qua in sequentibus; ex significatione 
`matutae' seu `mane,' quod sit principium status novi, ut supra n. 8427; et ex significatione `ad satiandum' seu ad satietatem, quod sit quantum (x)vellent, de qua supra n. 8410, hic quantum recipere 
possent, nam bonum quod influit a Domino non datur quantum volunt, sed quantum recipere possunt; malum autem licet quantum volunt. </p>
