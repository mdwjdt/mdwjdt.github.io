<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9673节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9673.</strong>“绣上基路伯”表警觉，防止这二者混合，即免得属灵良善和属天良善，因而中间天堂和至内层天堂混和。这从“基路伯”的含义清楚可知，“基路伯”是指警觉和天命，免得不通过爱就接近主，也免得存在于天堂并与一个人同在的来自主的良善受到任何伤害（参看<a href="9509.htm">9509</a>节）。之所以也表示免得属灵良善和属天良善，因而这两层天堂混和，是因为如果它们混和，这两种良善都会受到伤害，并且伤害得如此严重，以至于连天堂本身都会灭亡。这一点从这两种良善，因而这两层天堂之间的区别可以看出来，如前面9670节提到的地方所示。因此才会有处于属天-属灵良善和处于属灵-属天良善的中间天使社群存在；这两层天堂通过这些社群被联结在一起（<a href="9670.htm">9670</a>，<a href="9671.htm">9671</a>节）。即便在这些社群中，这两种良善也没有被联结在一起，而是彼此有别，分开存在。由此明显可知，这些社群是守卫，免得这两种良善混和；因此，“基路伯”也表示属于主的这种警觉和天命。</p>

With cherubs. That this signifies a guard lest spiritual good and celestial good, and thus the middle heaven and the inmost heaven, should be commingled, is evident from the signification of the "cherubs," 
as being guard and providence lest the Lord be approached except through good, and lest the good which is from the Lord in heaven and with man be injured (see n. 9509). That it also denotes lest 
spiritual good and celestial good, thus those two heavens, should be commingled, is because, if they were commingled, both goods would be injured, insomuch that the heavens themselves would perish. 
This can be seen from the difference between the two goods, thus between the two heavens, as shown in the places above cited (n. 9670). For this reason there are intermediate angelic societies which are 
in celestial spiritual good, and in spiritual celestial good, through which the conjunction is effected (n. 9671). Neither are these goods conjoined in these angelic societies; but they are distinct 
from one another. From all this it is evident that these societies are guards lest the two goods should be commingled; and therefore also that by the "cherubs" is signified this guard and providence 
of the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9673</b></p><p><b>9673.</b>
'With cherubs' means watchfulness, guarding against the intermingling of the two - of spiritual good and celestial good, and so of the middle heaven and the inmost heaven. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'cherubs' as watchfulness and providence, guarding against access to the Lord except through good and guarding against any harm being done to the good from the Lord which is present in heaven and 
with a person, dealt with in <a href="9509.htm">9509</a>. The reason why guarding against the intermingling of spiritual good and celestial good, and so of those two heavens, is also meant is that if they did become intermingled 
they would both suffer harm, harm so serious that those actual heavens would be destroyed, as may be recognized from the difference between the two kinds of good, and so between the two heavens, 
spoken about in the places referred to above in <a href="9670.htm">9670</a>. For this reason there are intermediate angelic communities, among whom celestial-spiritual good exists and spiritual-celestial good; and through 
these communities the two heavens are linked together, <a href="9670.htm">9670</a>, <a href="9671.htm">9671</a>. Even with these communities the two forms of good have not been joined together, but exist distinct and separate from each other. 
From all this it is evident that those communities are guards, protecting both kinds of good from becoming intermingled, and therefore also that this watchfulness and providence which are the Lord's are 
meant by 'cherubs'.  </p>

`Cherubis': quod significet custodiam ne commisceantur, nempe bonum spirituale et bonum caeleste, ita caelum medium et (o)caelum intimum, constat ex significatione `cheruborum' quod sint custodia et 
providentia ne Dominus nisi per bonum adeatur, et ne bonum quod a Domino in caelo et apud hominem laedatur, de qua n. 9509; quod etiam sit ne bonum spirituale et bonum caeleste, ita bini illi caeli, 
{1} commisceantur, est quia si commiscerentur {2}, bonum utrumque {3} laederetur, usque adeo ut ipsi caeli perirent.  Hoc constare potest ex differentia utriusque boni, ita utriusque caeli, in locis supra 
n. 9670 citatis; idcirco societates angelicae mediae sunt, quae in bono caelesti spirituali, et in bono spirituali caelesti, per quas conjunctio fit, n. 9670, 9671; apud has societates angelicas 
nec (t)illa bona conjuncta {4} sunt, sed inter se distincta.  Ex his patet quod illae societates sint custodiae ne utraque bona commisceantur; et sic quod etiam illa custodia et providentia Domini significetur 
per `cherubos.' @1 After commisceantur,$ @2 commisceatur altered to commiscerentur then commisceatur restored$ @3 utruisque coeli$ @4 commixta$ </p>
