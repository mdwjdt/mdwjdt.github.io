<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2429节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2429.</strong>“那只是一座小城”表通过他所拥有的少许真理。这从“城”的含义清楚可知，“城”是指真理，如刚才所述。这城是小的，表示真理有少许；此处表示通过他所拥有的这少许行事，这从前后文明显看出来。<br />关于这个问题，也就是说，与那些拥有对良善的情感之人相比，那些拥有对真理的情感之人拥有少许真理。这一点从以下事实明显看出来：他们通过自己所拥有的那点贫乏、模糊的良善看见真理。人里面的真理正是基于他里面的良善。哪里的良善少，哪里的真理就少。它们处于相同的比例和相同的程度，或如人们所说的，它们彼此步调一致。事实上，这似乎是一个悖论，但事实的确如此。良善正是真理的本质，真理若没有它的本质，就不是真理，尽管看似真理；它只不过是空响的锣，就象一个空瓶子。<br />为让人有真理在自己里面，他必须不仅知道真理，而且还承认它、信它。那时，他才第一次拥有真理，因为那时真理会对他产生影响，并保留下来。若他仅仅知道真理，却不承认它、信它，情况则不同。在这种情况下，他没有真理在自己里面。这就是很多恶人的情况：他们能知道真理，有时比其他人知道得还要多；但他们仍没有真理；事实上，他们拥有真理就更少了，因为他们发自内心否认它。<br />主规定，人所拥有（即承认并相信）真理的量，不会多过他所接受的良善的量。这就是为何此处论及表示真理的城时，经上说“那只是一座小城”，在本节又说“它岂不是小的”，以及在22节，他称那城名为“琐珥”，“琐珥”的原义就表示“小”。其原因是，此处所论述的主题是那些拥有对真理的情感，但不怎么拥有对良善的情感之人。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2429</b></p><p><b>2429.</b>
It is a little one. That this signifies from the little truth that he had, is evident from the signification of a "city," as being truth, concerning which just above. Its being "little" signifies that 
there was little of truth; here, from the little that he had, as is evident from what precedes and what follows. [2] As regards the thing itself, namely, that they who are in the affection of truth 
have little truth in comparison with those who are in the affection of good, this is evident from the fact that it is from the meager and obscure good appertaining to them that they regard truth. The 
truth in a man is exactly according to the good that is in him. Where there is little good, there is little truth. They are in a like ratio and in a like degree, or, as we say, they march with even step. 
This indeed may seem a paradox, but still the case is so. Good is the very essence of truth, and truth without its essence is not truth, although it appears as if it were; it is merely a sounding 
brass, and is like an empty vessel. [3] In order that anyone may have truth in himself, he must not only know it, but also acknowledge it, and have faith in it; he then for the first time has truth, 
because it then affects him, and remains. It is otherwise when he only knows truth, and does not acknowledge it, and have faith in it; for in this case he has not the truth in himself. This is the case 
with many who are in evil: they are able to know truths, sometimes more than other men; but still they have not the truth; nay, they have it so much the less, because at heart they deny it. [4] It 
is provided by the Lord that no one should have (that is, acknowledge and believe) more truth than he receives of good. Hence it is here said of the city, by which truth is signified, that it is a "little 
one," and again in this verse, "Is it not a little one?" also in verse 22, that he called the name of the city "Zoar," which in the original language means "little;" for the reason that those are 
here treated of who are in the affection of truth, and not so much in the affection of good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2429</b></p><p><b>2429.</b>
'It is smell' means from the small amount of it which he had. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'a city' as truth, dealt with immediately above. The reference to its being 'small' means a small 
amount of truth, here acting from the small amount he had, as is clear from what comes before and after. As regards this matter, namely that those with the affection for truth possess little truth in 
comparison with those with the affection for good, this becomes clear from the consideration that they see truth from a poor and obscure good residing with them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The truth present with someone 
is altogether as is the good with him. Where there is little good there is little truth. They are present in the same ratio and are of the same degree, or as people say, they march in step with each other. 
This may indeed seem a paradox but it is nevertheless the truth. Good is the actual essence of truth, and truth without its essence is not truth. Although it looks as though it were, it is no more 
than something that merely resounds, and is like an empty vessel.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 For anyone to have the truth within him he must not only know it, but also acknowledge it and have faith in it. When he does 
he possesses truth for the first time, for in that case it has an influence on him and remains. It is different when he merely knows the truth but does not acknowledge it and have faith in it. In that 
case he does not have the truth within him, as applies to many who are governed by evil. They can know of truths, sometimes better than anybody else, but they nevertheless do not possess it. Indeed 
their possession of it is so much the less because at heart they deny it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It is provided by the Lord that no one should possess- that is, acknowledge and believe - a greater amount of truth than 
of the good which he receives. This is why here it is said of the city, which means truth, that 'it is small', and again in this same verse 'is it not small?' and also in verse 22 that 'he called the 
name of the city Zoar', which means small in the original language. The reason for this is that the subject here is people with the affection for truth, and not so much with the affection for good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2429</b>
</p><b>2429.</b>
Quod `ea parva' significet quod ex parvo quod haberet, constare potest a significatione `urbis' quod sit verum, de qua mox supra, quae quod `parva,' significat quod parum veri, hic quod ex parvo quod 
haberet, ut constat ab illis quae praecedunt et quae sequuntur. Quod ipsam rem attinet, nempe quod parum veri sit illis qui in affectione veri, respective ac illis qui in affectione boni, constare potest 
ex eo quod (m)ex pusillo et obscuro bono quod apud illos, spectent verum; [2] verum apud hominem se prorsus habet secundum bonum apud eum; ubi parum boni, ibi parum veri; in simili ratione sunt 
et in simili gradu, seu pari passu, ut dicitur, ambulant; quod quidem ut paradoxon videri potest, sed usque ita se habet; bonum est ipsa essentia veri, verum absque sua essentia non est verum, tametsi 
apparet sicut foret, est modo sonans quid, et sicut vas vacuum; [3] ut quis verum apud se habeat, non solum debet scire illud sed etiam agnoscere et ei fidem habere; cum hoc, tunc primum habet verum, 
quia tunc id afficit eum et manet; aliter cum modo scit verum et non agnoscit ac ei fidem habet, tunc non habet in se verum; ut fit apud plures qui in malo sunt; ii scire possunt vera et quandoque prae 
aliis, sed usque non habent illud, immo tanto minus habent quia corde suo illud negant; [4] providetur a Domino ut nemo plus veri habeat, hoc est agnoscat et credat quam quantum boni recipiat: inde 
est quod hic dicatur de urbe, per quam significatur verum, quod `ea parva,' ac iterum in hoc versu, `annon parva ea?' tum vers. 22, quod `vocavit nomen urbis Zoar,' per quod in lingua originali {1} significatur 
parvum, ex causa quia hic agitur de illis qui in affectione veri sunt, et non ita in affectione boni. 	@1 etiam.$ </p>
