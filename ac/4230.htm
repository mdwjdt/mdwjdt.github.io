<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4230节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4230.</strong>旧教会结束，新教会即将开始之时，就是最后审判之时。这就是圣言中“最后的审判”，以及“人子降临”所指的时候（参看<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>-<a href="2133.htm">2133</a>，<a href="3353.htm">3353</a>，<a href="4057.htm">4057</a>节）。现在所论述的主题正是这降临，就是门徒问主时所提到的降临：<br />请告诉我们，什么时候有这些事？你降临和今世的完结，有什么预兆呢？（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.3.htm">24:3</a>）<br />因此，现在要解释的是主关于祂的降临和今世完结，也就是最后审判的预言。<br />不过，本章开头这几节仅涵盖32-35节的内容，这几节经文如下：<br />你们可以从无花果树学个比方：当树枝发嫩长叶的时候，你们就知道夏天近了。这样，你们看见这一切的事，也该知道人子近了，正在门口了。我实在告诉你们：这世代还没有过去，这些事都要成就。天地要废去，我的话却不能废去。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.32.htm">24:32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.35.htm">35</a>）<br />这些话的内义如下。</p>

When the end of an old church and the beginning of a new church is at hand, then is the Last Judgment. This is the time that is meant in the Word by the "Last Judgment" (see n. 2117-2133, 3353, 4057), 
and also by the "coming of the Son of man." It is this very Coming that is now the subject before us, as referred to in the question addressed to the Lord by the disciples:       Tell us when shall 
these things be, especially what is the sign of Thy coming, and of the consummation of the age? (Matt. 24:3). It remains therefore to unfold the things predicted by the Lord concerning this very time 
of His Coming and of the Consummation of the age which is the Last Judgment; but in the preface to this chapter only those contained in verses 32 to 35:       Now learn a parable from the fig-tree. 
When her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that the summer is nigh. So also ye, when ye see all these things, know that it is nigh, even at the doors. Verily I say unto you, 
This generation shall not pass away till all these things be accomplished. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away (Matt. 24:32-35). The internal sense of these words is 
as follows. </p>

When the end of the old Church and the start of the new is at hand, that is the time of the Last Judgement. For such a time is meant in the Word by the Last Judgement, see <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>-<a href="2133.htm">2133</a>, <a href="3353.htm">3353</a>, <a href="4057.htm">4057</a>. That 
time is also meant by the coming of the Son of Man. It is that very coming which is being referred to now, and the coming which the disciples asked the Lord about when they said, </p>
<blockquote>
Tell us, when will 
those things take place; what especially will be the sign of Your coming and of the close of the age? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>There now remains to be explained therefore that which the Lord has foretold about 
the actual time of His coming and of the close of the age, which is the Last Judgement. </p>

 But in this present foregoing section to a chapter the contents of only verses 32-35 are covered, which 
verses are these, </p>
<p>But from the fig tree learn a parable When its branch now becomes tender and leaves sprout forth, you know that summer is near. So also yourselves - when you see all these things, 
know that He is near at the doors. Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away </p>
<p>The 
internal sense of these words is as follows. </p>

Quando finis veteris Ecclesiae ac principium novae adest, tunc est ultimum judicium; quod illud tempus sit quod per ultimum judicium in Verbo intelligitur, videatur n. 2117-2133, 3353, 4057; </p>
<p>et quoque 
per adventum Filii hominis: de ipso adventu nunc agitur, de quo discipuli Dominum quaesiverunt, dicentes,           Dic nobis quando ista fient, imprimis quodnam, signum      Tui adventus, et 
consummationis saeculi, vers. 3, cap. xxiv, apud Matthaeum: jam {1} itaque sequuntur explicanda, quae Dominus de (o)ipso tempore adventus Sui, et consummationis saeculi, quae est ultimum judicium, 
praedixit {2}; continentur in versibus 32-35, quae sunt haec,           Ab autem ficu discite parabolam, quando jam ramus ejus      fit tener, et folia enata, scitis quod prope aestas.  Sic et    
  vos, quando videritis haec omnia, scitote quod prope sit ad      fores. Amen dico vobis, non praeteribit generatio haec,      donec omnia haec fiunt.  Caelum et terra transibunt, verba      autem 
Mea non transibunt. Horum (o)verborum sensus internus est qui sequitur.      @1 nunc$      @2 dixit$ </p>
