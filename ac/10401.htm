<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10401节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10401</strong>.“亚伦对他们说”表圣言、教会和敬拜的外在，没有内在之物。这从此处“亚伦”的代表清楚可知，“亚伦”在此是指圣言、教会和敬拜的没有内在的外在（参看<a href="10397.htm">10397</a>节）。以色列和犹太民族当中并没有一个教会，只有一个教会的代表，因而只有一个没有内在的外在，这一点从亚伦身上很清楚地看出来；亚伦尽管是这个民族的一个典型成员，但仍做了大祭司，教会最神圣的事物都交付给了他，他也因此被认为比其他所有人都神圣。因为经上论到亚伦说，他造了一只金牛犊，在它面前筑了一座坛，还在它面前宣告向耶和华守节；从而把这罪带给百姓，使百姓放肆（32:2，4，5，21，25，35）；在别处又说，耶和华向亚伦甚是发怒，要灭绝他，摩西为他祈祷（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申9.20.htm">9:20</a>）。这些话意味着亚伦和百姓一样，他们心里都是偶像崇拜者（<a href="4208.htm">4208</a>，<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4820.htm">4820</a>，<a href="5998.htm">5998</a>，<a href="6877.htm">6877</a>，<a href="7401.htm">7401</a>，<a href="8301.htm">8301</a>，<a href="8882.htm">8882</a>节）。但由于这个民族只有没有内在的教会的外在，然而通过这外在仍会有与天堂的联系，所以只要一个人在进行外在仪式时，能遵守所颁布的律例并尊敬它们，那么他是什么样则无关紧要。代表并不关注这个人，只关注这个人所代表的真实事物（参看<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="1097.htm">1097</a>e，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>，<a href="4208.htm">4208</a>，<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4288.htm">4288</a>，<a href="4444.htm">4444</a>，<a href="8588.htm">8588</a>节）。</p>

And Aaron said unto them. That this signifies the external of the Word, of the church, and of worship, without what is internal, is evident from the representation of Aaron here, as being the external 
of the Word, of the church, and of worship without the internal (see above, n. 10397). That with the Israelitish and Jewish nation there was not a church, but only the representative of a church, thus 
an external without an internal, is very evident from Aaron, who although of such a character was nevertheless made the high priest, to whom were committed the most holy things of the church, and who 
therefore was accounted holy above all others. For it is said of Aaron that he made a golden calf, built an altar before it, proclaimed a feast to jehovah* before it; that he thus brought this sin 
upon the people, and that he made them lax (verses 2, 4, 5, 21, 25, 35). And in another place it is said that Jehovah was moved with anger against Aaron exceedingly, to destroy him, and that Moses prayed 
for him (Deut. 9:20). These things imply that Aaron was like the people, who at heart were idolaters (n. 4208, 4281, 4820, 5998, 6877, 7401, 8301, 8882). But as with this nation there was merely the 
external of the church without the internal, and yet there was thereby communication with heaven, the character of the man was a matter of indifference, provided that when he was in externals he acted 
according to the statutes and revered them. (That representatives did not regard the person, but the thing that was represented, see n. 665, 1097, 3670, 4208, 4281, 4288, 4444, 8588.) * The name 
"jehovah" is in this connection given by Swedenborg with a small initial letter, doubtless because as applied to the golden calf the name is profane and unworthy of veneration. The same remark applies 
to "divine" as here used, for contrary to his usual custom Swedenborg here writes this word with a small initial letter. See also n. 10566, 10603. [REVISER.] </p>

'And Aaron said to them' means the outward features of the Word, the Church, and worship, devoid of the inward. This is clear from the representation here of 'Aaron' as the outward features of the Word, 
the Church, and worship, devoid of the inward, dealt with above in <a href="10397.htm">10397</a>. The fact that no Church existed among the Israelite and Jewish nation, only what was representative of a Church, thus an outward 
form devoid of the inward substance, is perfectly clear from Aaron, who, though a typical member of that nation, was nevertheless made the high priest, to whom the most sacred things of the Church 
were entrusted, and who was therefore considered to be holier than everyone else. For it is said of him that he made the golden calf, built an altar for it, made a proclamation that there was to be 
'a feast to Jehovah' for it, brought that sin upon the people, and caused them to become undisciplined, in verses 2,4,5,21,25,35; and elsewhere that Jehovah was greatly moved with anger against Aaron 
and would have destroyed him, and that Moses prayed for him, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%209:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 9:20</a>. These words imply that Aaron was like the people, who were idolatrous at heart, <a href="4208.htm">4208</a>, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4820.htm">4820</a>, <a href="5998.htm">5998</a>, <a href="6877.htm">6877</a>, <a href="7401.htm">7401</a>, <a href="8301.htm">8301</a>, <a href="8882.htm">8882</a>. 
But since only the outward form of a Church devoid of its inward substance existed with that nation, and yet by means of it there was contact with heaven, it did not matter what a person there was 
like, provided that when engaged in external observances he obeyed what had been decreed and revered it.  </p>
<p>In the case of representatives no attention is paid to the person, only to the reality represented 
by that person, see <a href="665.htm">665</a>, <a href="1097.htm">1097</a>(end), <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, <a href="4208.htm">4208</a>, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4288.htm">4288</a>, <a href="4444.htm">4444</a>, <a href="8588.htm">8588</a>.  </p>

`Et dixit ad illos Aharon': quod significet externum Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus, absque interno, constat ex repraesentatione `Aharonis' hic, quod sit externum Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus, absque interno, 
de qua supra n. 10,397. Quod apud gentem Israeliticam et Judaicam non fuerit Ecclesia sed solum repraesentativum Ecclesiae, {1}ita externum absque interno {2}, constat manifeste ab Aharone, qui 
tametsi talis, usque factus est sacerdos maximus, cui sanctissima Ecclesiae commissa {3}erant, et qui inde sanctus prae reliquis {4}habitus fuit; de illo enim dicitur quod fecerit vitulum aureum, aedificaverit 
pro eo altare, {5} proclamaverit {6}festum jehovae {7}pro eo, {5} quod adduxerit super populum id peccatum, quodque {8}illum dissolutum fecerit, vers. 2, 4, 5, 21, 25, 35; et alibi, 	Quod 
Jehovah contra Aharonem ira motus sit valde ad perdendum eum, et quod Moscheh oraverit pro illo, Deut. ix 20; </p>
<p>quae involvunt quod Aharon similis populo fuerit, qui corde idololatricus, n. 4208, 4281, 
4820, 5998, 6877, 7401, 8301, 8882; sed quia externum Ecclesiae solum apud illam gentem erat absque interno, et per id usque communicatio cum caelo fuit, ideo perinde fuit qualis homo ibi esset, modo, 
cum in externis erat, ageret secundum statuta, et illa coleret; quod (x)repraesentativa (m)non spectaverint personam sed rem quae repraesentabatur, videatur n. 665, 1097 fin., 3670, 4208, 4281, 4288,
