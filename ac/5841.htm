<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5841节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5841.</strong>“我便在父亲面前终日担罪”表转身离开，教会的良善由此不复存在。这从“罪”的含义清楚可知，“罪”是指分离（参看<a href="5229.htm">5229</a>，<a href="5474.htm">5474</a>节），因而是指转身离开。如果“犹大”所代表的外在教会的良善转身离开“以色列”所代表的内在教会的良善，那么教会就不再有任何良善。实际的联结本身使得教会所来自的良善存在。至于这两种良善，即内在教会的良善和外在教会的良善，情况是这样：内在教会的良善，或内在良善通过流入产生外在教会的良善，或外在良善。正因如此，内在良善将外在良善提升到自己这里，以便这外在良善能仰望它，并通过它仰望主。当有联结时，这种情况就会发生。但是，若有分离，外在良善就会转身离开并向下看，从而灭亡。“我便在父亲面前终日担罪”所表示的，正是这种转身离开。</p>

I shall sin to my father all the days. That this signifies a turning away, and thus that there would be no good of the church, is evident from the signification of "sinning," as being disjunction (see 
n. 5229, 5474), thus a turning away; and if the good of the external church which Judah represents, averts itself from the good of the internal church represented by Israel, there is no longer any good 
of the church. The conjunction itself causes that there is good from which is the church. With these two goods, of the internal church and of the external, the case is this. The good of the internal 
church, or internal good, produces the good of the external church, or external good, by influx; and because it is so, internal good elevates to itself external good in order that this may look to 
it, and through it upward toward the Lord. This takes place when there is conjunction; but if there is disjunction, external good turns itself away, and looks downward, and thus perishes. It is this turning 
away which is signified by "I shall sin to my father all the days." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5841</b></p><p><b>5841.</b>
'I shall be sinning against my father all my days' means a turning away, as a result of which the good of the Church ceases to exist. This is clear from the meaning of 'sinning' as a separation, dealt 
with in <a href="5229.htm">5229</a>, <a href="5474.htm">5474</a>, and so a turning away. And if the good of the external Church, which 'Judah' represents, turns away from the good of the internal Church, which 'Israel' represents, the good of the 
Church is made to go out of existence. The actual joining together causes the good from which the Church receives its being to exist. With those two kinds of good - the good of the internal Church 
and the good of the external Church - the situation is this: By means of influx the good of the internal Church, which is internal good, brings the good of the external Church, which is external good, 
into being. This being so, internal good raises external good up to itself so that such external good may look to it, and thereby look up towards the Lord. This is the situation when they exist joined 
together. But if they are separated external good turns away and looks downwards, and by doing that is destroyed. This turning away is what is meant by 'I shall be sinning against my father all my days'. </p>

`Et peccabo patri meo omnibus diebus': quod significet  aversionem, et sic quod nullum Ecclesiae bonum, constat a significatione `peccare' quod sit disjunctio, de qua n. 5229, 5474, ita aversio; et 
si se avertit bonum Ecclesiae externae quod `Jehudah' repraesentat, a bono Ecclesiae internae quod `Israel', fit non amplius aliquod Ecclesiae bonum; ipsa conjunctio facit ut bonum sit ex quo Ecclesia. 
Cum binis illis bonis, nempe bono internae Ecclesiae et bono externae, ita se habet: bonum internae Ecclesiae seu bonum internum, per influxum producit bonum externae Ecclesiae seu bonum externum; et 
quia ita, bonum internum elevat ad se bonum externum ut spectet semet, et per semet sursum versus Dominum; hoc fit quando conjunctio; at si disjunctio, {1} bonum externum avertit se et spectat deorsum, 
et sic perit; haec aversio est quae significatur per `peccabo patri meo omnibus diebus'. @1 i in m quae sit, si non verum novum quod Benjamin repraesentat, id enim est medium conjungens, tunc$ </p>
