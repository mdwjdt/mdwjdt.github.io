<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2147节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2147.</strong>创世记18:2. 举目观看，见有三个人在他对面站着。他一见，就从帐棚门口跑去迎接他们，俯伏在地。<br />“举目观看”表祂在自己里面看见。“见有三个人在他对面站着”表神性本身，神性人和神圣活动。“他一见”表当祂意识到这一点时。“跑去迎接他们”表祂在思维中更接近被觉察之物。“从帐棚门口”表从那时属于主的神圣。“俯伏在地”表出于随之而来的喜悦的谦卑表现。</p>

Verse 2. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and behold three men standing over him; and he saw them, and ran to meet them from the door of the tent, and bowed himself toward the earth. "He lifted up 
his eyes," signifies that He saw within Himself; "and behold three men standing over him," signifies the Divine Itself, the Divine Human, and the Holy proceeding; "and he saw them," signifies when He 
observed this; "and ran to meet them," signifies that in thought He approached nearer to the things that were being perceived; "from the door of the tent," signifies from the holy which at that time 
appertained to the Lord; "and bowed himself toward the earth," signifies the effect of humiliation, from the consequent joy. </p>

Verse 2 And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, three men standing over him. And he saw, and ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed down towards the ground.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> </p>
<p>'He lifted up his eyes' 
means that He saw within Himself. 'And behold, three men standing over him' means the Divine itself, the Divine Human, and the Holy proceeding. 'And he saw' means when He recognized this. 'And he ran 
to meet them' means that He came closer in thought to those things that were perceived. 'From the tent door' means from the holiness that was the Lord's at that time. 'And he bowed down towards the ground' 
means the expression of humility from the resulting joy.

Vers. 2.  Et sustulit oculos suos, et vidit, et ecce tres vii stantes super illum; et vidit, et cucurrit obviam illis, a janua tentorii, et incurvavit se versus terram. `Sustulit oculos suos' significat 
quod viderit intra se: `et ecce tres vili stantes super illum' significat Divinum Ipsum, Divinum Humanum et Sanctum procedens: `et vidit' significat cum hoc apperciperet: `et cucurrit obviam illis' 
significat quod propius cogitatione accesserit ad illa quae percipiebantur: `a janua tentorii' significat a sancto quod tunc Domino: `et incurvavit se versus terram' significat effectum humiliationis 
ex gaudio inde. </p>
