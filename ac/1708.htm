<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1708节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1708.</strong>“就率领他家里生养的精练壮丁”表外在人中的那些良善，它们现已从奴役的枷锁中解脱出来。这从“精练壮丁”和“亚伯兰家里生养” 的含义清楚可知。就内义而言，亚伯兰的“精练壮丁”（即训练有素但无经验）是指外在人中那些能与内层人结合的良善；而那些“家里生养的”在内义上同样指那些良善，也指真理，是属于内层人的。不过，这些事所包含的奥秘多到难以尽述。这些奥秘首先是：经历试探的争战后，表面的良善如何变成纯正的良善，然后又如何与内层人或中间人结合，由此与内在人结合，并以同样的方式变成神性，因为主逐步将其人性本质与其神性本质融合起来，这一过程要藉着试探的争战和胜利，如前所述。被称为亚伯兰的“精练壮丁”的，就是这些变得纯正的良善。因为这些良善训练有素，但缺乏经验。它们由于凭祂自己的力量获得，故被称为“家里生养” 的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1708.</strong> And he mustered his trainees, offspring of his household, symbolizes the goodness in his outward self that was now free of slavery's yoke, as can be seen from the symbolism of Abram's trainees and the offspring of his household. In an inner sense, Abram's trainees or novices are the good qualities of the outer self that are capable of allying with the intermediate self. The offspring of his household in an inner sense is the fact that these same good qualities, and truths as well, were his own. This sentence holds more secrets than can be expressed, however. In particular it contains information about the way apparent goodness becomes real goodness after our spiritual struggles are over. It also reveals that this goodness is then capable of allying with the intermediate self and through this with the inward self and of becoming divine in the process. The Lord, you see, gradually joined his human nature to his divine nature, and he did so by fighting his spiritual battles and winning them, as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1708/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1659#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1659:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1708/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1661#subsection-2-5" target=_top>1661:5</a>]. This goodness, which had become genuine, is what is being called Abram's trainees, or novices, because it was indeed newly trained. Because he accumulated it by his own power, it is called the offspring of his household. </p>

And he hastened his trained men that were born in his house. That this signifies these goods and truths in the external man which were now delivered from the yoke of servitude, is evident from the signification 
of the "trained men," as also of those "born in Abram's house." Abram's "men in training," or novitiates, in the internal sense, are those goods in the external man which can be conjoined 
with the interior man; those "born in the house," in the internal sense, are the same goods and also truths, as being proper to that man. But these things contain more arcana that can be told; in the 
first place these-how, after the combats of temptations, apparent goods become genuine goods, and that they can then be conjoined with the interior or middle man, and through this with the internal man, 
and be made in like manner Divine. For the Lord adjoined His Human Essence to His Divine Essence by degrees, and this by means of combats of temptations and victories, as before said. These goods that 
were made genuine are what are called Abram's "men in training," or novitiates; for these goods were in training, and were novitiates; and as they were procured by His own power, they are called "born 
in his house." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1708</b></p><p><b>1708.</b>
'And he brought out his trained men, born in his house' means these goods residing with the External Man which were now released from the yoke of slavery. This is clear from the meaning of 'trained men' 
and also of 'bore in Abram's house'. In the internal sense 'Abram's trained men' - that is, trained but inexperienced - are those goods residing with the External Man that are able to be joined to 
the Interior Man, while those 'born in the house' in the internal sense are those same goods, and also truths, as belonging to that Interior Man. But these matters contain more arcana than can be made 
known. Those arcana have to do primarily with the way in which, following the conflicts brought about by temptations, apparent goods become genuine goods, and with the fact that when this happens they 
can be joined to the Interior Man and through the Interior Man to the Internal Man, and in like manner be made Divine. For the Lord, by degrees, joined the Human Essence to the Divine Essence, doing 
so, as has been stated, through conflicts and victories in temptations. These goods that were made genuine are what are called 'Abram's trained men' or inexperienced ones, for those goods had undergone 
training but were 'inexperienced'. And because they were acquired by His own power, they are called those 'born in the house'. </p>

</p><b>1708.</b>
'Et expedivit initiatos suos, natos domus suae': quod significet illa bona quae apud Externum hominem quae nunc liberata a jugo servitutis, constat a significatione 'initiatorum,' tum 'natorum domus 
Abrami'; 'initiati seu novitii Abrami' in sensu interno sunt illa bona apud Externum Hominem quae conjungi possunt Interiori Homini; 'nati domus' in sensu interno sunt eadem bona ut et vera quod propria 
sint; sed haec plura arcana continent quam ut possint edici, illa imprimis quomodo bona apparentia post pugnas tentationum fiunt bona genuina, et quod tunc possint conjungi Interiori seu Medio Homini, 
et per hunc Interno, et similiter fieri Divina; Dominus enim per gradus adjunxit Humanam Essentiam Divinae, et hoc per pugnas tentationum et victorias, ut dictum; haec bona quae genuina facta, sunt 
quae appellantur 'initiati seu novitii Abrami,' nam initiata et novitia fuerunt; et quia propria potentia comparata sunt, appellantur 'nati domus.' </p>
