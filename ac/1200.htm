<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1200节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1200.</strong>前面论述迦南的地方已说明，“迦南”表其中没有内在之物的外在敬拜。名为迦南的外在敬拜就是诸如犹太人所具有的那类敬拜，无论主降世前还是降世后。他们恪守外在敬拜，却全然不知何为内在，以致他们以为自己仅靠肉体活着。对于灵魂的性质，信，主，属灵和属天的生命，他们一无所知。因此，在主的时代，他们中的很多人否认耶稣复活，这明显可见于马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.22.htm">22:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.33.htm">33</a>），马可福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.18.htm">12:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.28.htm">28</a>）和路加福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.27.htm">20:27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.41.htm">41</a>）。人若不相信他死后仍活着，也不会相信属灵、属天的内在事物的存在。这也适用于生活完全堕入恶欲之人，因为他们过着纯肉体和世俗的生活，尤其那些沉浸在肮脏贪婪中的人。然而，他们仍有敬拜，有的去犹太会堂或教会，参加一些礼拜仪式，有的还非常严格。但他们不相信死后的生活，所以其敬拜无非是其中没有内在事物的外在敬拜，就象没有核仁的外壳，或没有果实，甚至没有叶子的树。这类外在敬拜就是“迦南”所表示的。上述外在敬拜的所有其它类型是其中包含内在事物的敬拜形式。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1200.</strong> The symbolism of Canaan as outward worship that has no inner content has been demonstrated in earlier discussions of Canaan [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1200/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1063" target=_top>1063</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1200/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1094" target=_top>1094</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1200/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1103" target=_top>1103</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1200/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1167" target=_top>1167</a>]. The outward display of worship that is called Canaan is the kind that Jews practiced before the Lord's Coming and after it as well.{*1} They had an external form of devotion that they observed very strictly, without realizing what its inner dimension was. In fact they imagined their bodies alone were alive. They had absolutely no idea what the soul was, what faith was, what the Lord was, what spiritual or heavenly life was, or what life after death was. As a result, many of them in the Lord's time{*2} denied the resurrection, as <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1200/bible_king-james-version_matthew_22_23-34" target=_top>Matthew 22:23-34</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1200/bible_king-james-version_mark_12_18-28" target=_top>Mark 12:18-28</a>; and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1200/bible_king-james-version_luke_20_27-41" target=_top>Luke 20:27-41</a> show.<br />[2] When we are such that we do not believe we live on after death, we also fail to believe that any inner dimension exists, whether spiritual or heavenly.<br />People who spend their lives on mere self-gratification — especially those mired in sordid greed — are like this too, because they devote their lives exclusively to their person and to worldly advantages. Nonetheless, they engage in worship, one group attending synagogue, another going to church; and they observe traditional rites, some of them doing so very strictly. But since they do not believe in life after death, their worship cannot help being shallow, without any inner content, like a nutshell without the meat, or like a tree without fruit and even without leaves.<br />This is what the outward devotions symbolized by Canaan are like.<br />All the other types of inward worship discussed above were types of worship that did contain inner levels.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On Swedenborg's attitude toward Jews, see note 4 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1200/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259" target=_top>259</a>, as well as the reader's guide in volume 1, pages 51-55. [Editors]<br />{*2} At <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1200/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_14" target=_top>14</a> Swedenborg explains that he uses "the Lord" to mean Jesus, so "in the Lord's time" would be while Jesus was on earth.

That "Canaan" signifies external worship in which there is nothing internal, was shown before where Canaan was treated of. The external worship which is called "Canaan" is such as was that of the Jews, 
both before and after the coming of the Lord. They had an external worship which they strictly observed, but yet were so ignorant of what is internal that they supposed that they lived only with the 
body. Of the nature of the soul, of faith, of the Lord, of spiritual and celestial life, of the life after death, they were entirely ignorant. And therefore in the time of the Lord very many of them 
denied the resurrection-as is evident in Matthew 22:22-33; Mark 12:18-28; Luke 20:27-41. When a man is such that he does not believe that he will live after death, he also disbelieves that there is anything 
internal which is spiritual and celestial; and such are they who live in mere cupidities, because they live a mere life of the body and of the world; especially those who are immersed in loathsome 
avarice. They nevertheless have worship, attend their synagogues, or their churches, and observe the ceremonies, some very strictly; but as they do not believe that there is a life after death, their 
worship cannot be other than external worship wherein is nothing internal-like a shell without a kernel, or a tree whereon is no fruit, and not even leaves. It is such external worship that is signified 
by "Canaan." The other kinds of external worship,* treated of above, were worships that had internal things within. * The Latin here, by a manifest slip, says "internal worship." [Reviser.] </p>

That 'Canaan' means external worship that has nothing internal within it has been shown already where Canaan was the subject. The type of external worship which is called 'Canaan' is similar to that 
of the Jews before the Lord's Coming, and after it as well. They had an external worship, which they also celebrated meticulously, yet they were unaware of what is internal, indeed so unaware of it as 
to imagine that they lived solely with a body. Of the soul, or faith, or the Lord, or spiritual and celestial life, or life after death, they were totally ignorant. Consequently very many in the Lord's 
time said that there was no resurrection, as is clear in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2022:23-33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 22:23-33</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2012:18-27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 12:18-27</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2020:27-40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 20:27-40</a>. When a person is such that he does not believe he will live after death, he also does not believe 
in the existence of anything internal which is spiritual and celestial. This applies also to people whose lives are sunk in wholly evil desires because they lead merely bodily and worldly lives, especially 
those who are steeped in filthy avarice. They nevertheless have worship, some going to synagogue, or to church, and taking part in the services, some most meticulously. But because they do not 
believe in a life after death their worship is inevitably external worship having nothing internal within it, like a shell without a nut, and like a tree on which there is no fruit or even leaves. 
Such external worship is meant by 'Canaan'. All other types of external worship dealt with above were forms of worship that had internal things within them. </p>

</p><b>1200.</b>
Quod 'Canaan' significet cultum externum in quo nihil internum, prius ubi de Canaane, ostensum est:  cultus externus, qui 'Canaan' vocatur, est talis qualis ante Adventum Domini, tum post Adventum Ipsius, 
fuit Judaeorum; qui cultum externum habebant quem etiam stricte observabant, sed usque nesciebant quid internum, usque adeo ut se solum corpore vivere putaverint; quid anima, quid fides, quid Dominus, 
quid vita spiritualis et caelestis, quid vita post mortem, prorsus nesciebant; quare etiam tempore Domini plerique negabant resurrectionem,ut constat apud Matth. xxii (x)22-32 [A.V. 23-33] Marc. 
xii 18-28; Luc. xx 27-41.  Cum homo talis est ut non credat se victurum post mortem, etiam non credit quod aliquid internum spirituale et caeleste detur:  tales quoque sunt qui in meris cupiditatibus 
vivunt, quia vivunt meram vitam corporis et mundi, cumprimis qui foedae avaritiae immersi sunt; ii nihilominus cultum habent, frequentant illi synagogas, hi templa, et observant ritus, quidam eorum 
perquam stricte; sed quia non credunt dari vitam post mortem, cultus eorum non potest alius esse quam externus in quo nihil internum, sicut crusta absque nucleo, et sicut arbor in qua non fructus, et 
ne quidem folia:  talis externus cultus est qui per 'Canaan' significatur:  ceteri cultus (x)externi, de quibus supra actum, fuerunt cultus in quo interna.   </p>
