<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1911节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1911.</strong>“她见自己有孕，就小看她的主母”表该理性在孕育时就轻视与良善联结的真理本身。这从“主母”或撒莱的含义清楚可知，撒莱表示与良善联结的真理。理性在孕育之初不可能承认智性真理或属灵真理为真理的，因为这理性还粘附着许多谬论（或幻觉）和表象。谬论（或幻觉）出于从这个世界和自然界所汲取的记忆知识，而表象则出于取自圣言字义的知识，这些都不是真理。<br />例如：一切生命来自主，这是一个智性真理。但孕育之初的理性并不理解这一点，反而以为若不凭自己活着，它根本没有任何生命可言，甚至对相反的说法感到愤慨。我从仍坚持感官幻觉的灵人身上经常发现这一点。<br />一切善与真皆来自主，这是一个智性真理。但孕育之初的理性同样不理解这一点，因为它觉得它们来自它自己，还以为若善与真不来自它自己，它不可能思想善与真，更不可能行出善与真。并且，若它们来自另外一个源头，它就会放弃自己的努力，一直坐等流注。<br />除了良善外，没有任何事物，甚至没有一丝恶出自主，这是一个智性真理。但孕育之初的理性也不相信这一点，反而以为由于主统治万有，所以恶也源于祂。并且由于祂全能、全在，是良善本身，没有废除对地狱恶人的惩罚，所以它以为主愿意惩罚恶人。而事实上，主不向任何人行恶，也不愿任何人受到惩罚。<br />属天之人通过主拥有对善与真的直觉，这是一个智性真理。但孕育之初的理性要么彻底否认直觉的存在，要么认为人若通过别人而不是自己来觉察，就会象死了一样，或丧失生命。事实上，理性思维越是基于源自感官事物的记忆知识，越是基于哲学理论，就越不理解上述真理，以及其它一切智性真理。因为由此而来的谬论（或幻觉）会陷入更昏暗的阴影中。正因如此，学者比其他人更不信。<br />既然孕育之初的理性是这样，那么显然，它就小看它的主母，即轻视智性真理。在谬论（或幻觉）和表象被驱散之前，智性真理不会变得明显，即得不到承认。只要人出于感官事物和记忆知识推理真理本身，这些谬论（或幻觉）和表象就不会被驱散。当他出于简单的心思相信这就是真理，因为主就是这么说的时，它才首次显明。那时，谬论（或幻觉）的阴影被驱散，然后就再没有什么能阻止他理解智性真理的了。<br />然而，主没有任何谬论（或幻觉）。不过，祂的理性在孕育之初具有本身并非真理的真理表象，这从前面所述（<a href="1661.htm">1661</a>节）明显可知。这也解释了为何主的理性在孕育之初会轻视智性真理，但渐渐地，随着祂的理性变成神性，表象的云层被驱散，智性真理在自己的光中摊露在祂面前。这就是当以撒长大后，以实玛利就被逐出家门所代表和表示的。从下文（<a href="1914.htm">1914</a>节）可以看出，主并不轻视智性真理，而是觉察并发现祂的新理性轻视智性真理。</p>

And she saw that she had conceived, and her mistress was despised in her eyes. That this signifies that this rational, at its conception, lightly esteemed the truth itself that was adjoined to good, 
is evident from the signification of the "mistress," or Sarai, as being truth adjoined to good. The rational first conceived cannot acknowledge intellectual or spiritual truth as truth, because there 
adhere to this rational many fallacies from the memory-knowledges drawn from the world and from nature, and many appearances from the knowledges taken from the literal sense of the Word, and these are 
not truths.  [2] For example: it is an intellectual truth that all life is from the Lord; but the rational first conceived does not apprehend this, and supposes that if it did not live from itself it 
would have no life; nay, it is indignant if the contrary is said, as has been many times perceived from the spirits who still cling to the fallacies of the senses.  [3] It is an intellectual truth 
that all good and truth are from the Lord; but the rational first conceived does not apprehend this, because it has the feeling that they are as from itself; and it also supposes that if good and truth 
were not from itself, it could have no thought of good and truth, and still less do anything good and true; and that if they are from another it should let itself go, and wait all the time for influx. 
 [4] It is an intellectual truth that nothing but good is from the Lord, and not even the least of evil; and this too the rational first conceived does not believe, but supposes that because the Lord 
governs everything, evil also is from Him; and that because He is omnipotent and omnipresent, and is good itself, and does not take away the punishments of the evil in hell, He wills the evil of punishment; 
when yet He does evil to no one, nor does He will that anyone should be punished.  [5] It is an intellectual truth that the celestial man has from the Lord a perception of good and truth; 
but the first rational either denies the existence of perception altogether, or supposes that if a man were to perceive from another, and not from himself, he would be as if inanimate, or devoid of life. 
In fact the more the rational thinks from memory-knowledges that originate from sensuous things and from philosophical reasonings, the less does it apprehend the foregoing and all other intellectual 
truths, for the fallacies therefrom are involved in so much the darker shades. Hence it is that the learned believe less than others.  [6] Since the rational first conceived is such, it is evident 
that it despises its mistress, that is, it lightly esteems intellectual truth. Intellectual truth does not become manifest, that is, is not acknowledged, except insofar as fallacies and appearances are 
dispersed, and these are not dispersed so long as the man reasons about truths themselves from things of sense and from memory-knowledges, but it for the first time becomes manifest when he believes 
from a simple heart that it is truth because so said by the Lord. Then the shades of fallacies are dispersed, and then nothing in him prevents him from apprehending it.  [7] In the Lord however there 
were no fallacies, but when His rational was first conceived there were appearances of truth that in themselves were not truths, as is evident from what has been already said (n. 1661). Hence also 
His rational at its first conception lightly esteemed intellectual truth; but gradually, as His rational was made Divine, the clouds of the appearances were dispersed, and intellectual truths lay open 
to Him in their light; and this is represented and signified by Ishmael being expelled from the house when Isaac grew up. That the Lord did not lightly esteem intellectual truth, but that He perceived 
and saw that His new rational did so, will be seen from what follows (n. 1914).  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1911</b></p><p><b>1911.</b>
'And she saw that she had conceived, and her mistress was despised in her eyes' means that this rational at its conception despised truth itself that was allied to good. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'mistress', or Sarai, as truth allied to good. The rational conceived first is unable to acknowledge intellectual or spiritual truth as truth because it has clinging to it many illusions that are 
a product of what is known about the world and the natural order, and many appearances which are not truths but are a product of things known from the literal sense of the Word. For example, </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It 
is an intellectual truth that all life is from the Lord. The rational conceived first does not apprehend this, but supposes that if it did not live of itself it would possess no life at all; indeed 
it is angry if anything different is asserted, as I have noticed frequently in the case of spirits who cling to the illusions of the senses. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It is an intellectual truth that all good and truth 
are from the Lord. Again, the rational conceived first does not apprehend this because of its sensation that these are as if from itself; and also it supposes that if good and truth are not from itself, 
it is unable to think, let alone perform, anything good and true, and that if it did have some other source it would give up its own efforts and constantly wait for influx into itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It is 
an intellectual truth that nothing but good, and not even the smallest amount of evil, comes from the Lord. The rational conceived first does not believe this either, but it supposes that because the 
Lord rules over every single thing, even evil derives from Him. And because He is all powerful and present everywhere and is Goodness itself but does not abolish the punishments of evil people in hell, 
it supposes that He wills the evil of punishment, when in fact He does not do evil to anyone and does not will that anyone should be punished. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 It is an intellectual truth that the celestial 
man has from the Lord a perception of good and truth. But the first rational either denies the existence of perception altogether or else it supposes that if it did perceive from another and not from 
its own self it would be like one who is inanimate, or devoid of life. Indeed the more that the thinking of the rational is based on the facts that arise from sensory evidence and the more it is based 
on philosophical arguments, the less it apprehends these and all other intellectual truths, for the illusions that result are enveloped in shadows darker still. This is why the learned are less believing 
than others. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Since the rational conceived first is such, it is clear that 'it despises its mistress', that is, it despises intellectual truth. Intellectual truth is not open to view, that 
is, it is not acknowledged, until illusions and appearances have been dispersed, and these are never dispersed as long as a person reasons about truths themselves on the basis of sensory evidence and 
factual knowledge. But the moment he believes in simplicity of heart that it is the truth because the Lord has declared it to be so, the shadows of illusions are at that point dispelled, and then there 
is nothing to stop him apprehending it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 With the Lord however no illusions were present; but when His rational was first conceived there were appearances of truth which were not truths in themselves, 
as is evident from what has been stated in <a href="1661.htm">1661</a>. This also explains why His rational when first conceived despised intellectual truth, but step by step, as the rational became Divine, the clouds 
of appearances were dispersed and intellectual truths in their light were for Him open to view. This was represented and meant by the expulsion of Ishmael from the house when Isaac grew up. That the 
Lord did not despise intellectual truth but that He perceived and saw that His new rational did so will be clear from what follows in <a href="1914.htm">1914</a>. </p>

`Et vidit quod conceperit, et vilis fuit domina ejus in oculis ejus': quod significet quod rationale hoc in conceptione sua vilipenderet ipsum verum adjunctum bono, constat a significatione `dominae 
seu Sarai' quod sit verum adjunctum bono: rationale primo conceptum non potest agnoscere verum intellectuale seu spirituale pro vero quia adhaerent ei ex scientiis acceptis e mundo et natura plures fallaciae, 
et ex cognitionibus captis ex sensu litterali Verbi apparentiae quae non sunt vera; [2] ut pro exemplo: verum intellectuale est quod omnis vita a Domino; rationale primo conceptum id non capit, 
putat si non viveret ex se, nihil vitae haberet, immo indignatur si aliter dicitur, ut multoties apperceptum a spiritibus qui fallaciis sensuum inhaerent.  [3] Verum intellectuale est quod omne bonum 
et verum a Domino; rationale primo conceptum etiam hoc non capit quia sentit quod quasi a se, tum putat si non bonum et verum a se, quod nihil boni et veri cogitare minus facere possit, et si ab alio, 
quod remitteret se et continue exspectaret influxum.  [4] Verum intellectuale est quod nihil nisi bonum a Domino et quod ne hilum mali; rationale primo conceptum nec hoc credit, putat quia Dominus 
omnia et singula regit {1}, quod etiam malum ab Ipso, et quia omnipotens et omnipraesens {2} et est ipsum Bonum, nec tollit punitiones malorum in inferno, quod malum poenae velit, cum tamen non alicui 
malum facit nec aliquem puniri vult.  [5] Verum intellectuale est quod caelestis homo perceptionem boni et veri habeat a Domino; primum rationale (t)vel prorsus negat perceptionem, vel putat si perciperet 
ab alio et non a semet, quod foret sicut inanimatus seu nullius vitae: immo quo plus rationale ex scientificis oriundis ex sensualibus et quo plus (c)ex philosophicis cogitat, eo minus illa et 
reliqua vera intellectualia capit, nam fallaciae inde eo crassioribus umbris involvuntur; inde est quod docti minus quam alii credant.  [6] Cum rationale primo conceptum tale est, constat quod `vilem 
habeat dominam,' hoc est, vilipendat verum intellectuale: verum intellectuale non prius patet, hoc est, agnoscitur quam cum fallaciae et apparentiae {3} discussae sunt, quae nusquam discutiuntur quamdiu 
homo ratiocinatur de ipsis veris ex sensualibus et scientificis, sed tunc primum cum simplici corde credit quod verum sit, quia ita a Domino dictum, tunc discutiuntur fallaciarum umbrae, et apud eum 
tunc nihil facit quod non capiat.  [7] Apud Dominum autem nullae fuerunt fallaciae, sed cum primo rationale Ipsius conceptum, apparentiae veri quae non fuerunt vera in se, ut patet ab illis quae dicta 
sunt n. 1661; inde etiam rationale Ipsius in prima conceptione vilipendebat verum intellectuale, sed successive sicut rationale Divinum factum, nubes apparentiarum discussae sunt et intellectualia 
vera in sua luce Ipsi patuerunt, quod repraesentatum et significatum est per quod Ismael {4} expulsus domo cum adolevit Isacus.  (m)Quod Dominus non vilipenderit verum intellectuale, sed quod perceperit 
et viderit quod novum Ipsius rationale vilipenderet, (c)ex illis quae sequuntur n. 1914, constabit {5} (n). 	@1 i et disponit.$ 	@2 novit diras positiones et cruciatus illorum qui in inferno, nec
