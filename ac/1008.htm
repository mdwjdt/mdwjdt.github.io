<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1008节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1008.</strong>“追讨人的灵魂”就是报复亵渎。这从前节和本节所述清楚可知，因为主题是表亵渎的吃血。很少有人知道何为亵渎，更不知道在来生对亵渎的惩罚。亵渎具有多种形式。凡全然拒绝信之真理者不会亵渎它们，如生活在教会之外，对它们一无所知的外邦人。然而，人若知道信之真理，尤其承认它们，挂在嘴里，宣扬之，说服别人相信，同时却又过着仇恨、报复、残忍、抢劫和奸淫的生活，还从圣言中拼凑很多说法来认可自己的这类行为，就亵渎了它们。他通过滥用信之真理，因而将其浸没于这些污秽的恶行中进行亵渎。这就是亵渎之人。带给人死亡的，首先是这类亵渎。从以下事实清楚看出，它们会招致死亡：在来生，亵渎之物和圣洁之物完全分离，亵渎之物在地狱，而圣洁之物在天堂。当这类人进入来生后，其思维的一切念头和活在肉身时一样，包含粘附着亵渎之物的圣洁之物。若不粘附亵渎之物，他就无法产生一个有关圣洁之物的念头，这种粘附如同在大白天一样被看得清清楚楚，因为来生存在对别人念头的一种直觉。因此，亵渎会显现在他所思想的一切细节中，由于天堂憎恶亵渎，所以他不得不被推入地狱。<br />念头的性质几乎不为人所知。人们以为它们不是什么复杂的东西，殊不知，思维中的每一个念头都包含无数元素，它们以各种方式联结起来，以形成某种形式，从而勾画出这个人的形像，整个形像在来生会被发觉，甚至能被看到。举例说明：当脑海中浮现出一个地方的念头，无论这个地方是一个国家，一个城市还是一座房子时，那么这个人曾在那里所做一切事的想法和形像就会同时突然出现，它们全都被天使和精灵看到。或者，当有关他恨过的某个人的念头出现时，他对此人所思、所言和所行一切的念头就会同时出现。这适用于一切事的念头，但是，当想起这些事时，他针对某个具体问题所设想和印象深刻的每一个细节会变得非常明显。例如，如果他是个奸夫，当婚姻的念头突然出现时，那么奸淫和有关其思维的一切龌龊和淫秽也会突然出现，同样出现的还有他用来认可这类淫行所采用的一切证据，无论这些证据来自感官之物，还是理性之物，抑或来自圣言。并且，他掺杂和滥用圣言真理的方式也一并显现。<br />此外，一件事的念头会流入另一件事的，并给它染上颜色，如同一点黑色滴入水中，全部的水都会变黑时的情形。因此，一个精灵仅通过他的念头就能被识别出来，不可思议的是，他的每一个念头都带有他自己的形像和样式。当这样一个念头呈现在眼前时，它如此丑陋，以至于只是看一下就令人毛骨悚然。所有这一切清楚表明那些亵渎圣物之人的状态是何性质，以及他们在来生所呈现的形像。不过，那些简单相信圣言里的话之人决不可被说成亵渎圣物，即便他们相信从字义上看并不真实的事，因为圣言所说的一切都是照着表象来说的（对此，参看<a href="589.htm">589</a>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1008.</strong> To seek a person's soul means to avenge profanation, as can be seen from the things said in the last verse and in the present verse, since the topic is the eating of blood, which symbolizes profanation.<br />Few people know what profanation is, let alone what the punishment for it is in the other world.<br />There are many kinds of profanation. People who flatly deny the tenets of the faith (such as nations outside the church that lack access to basic religious knowledge) do not commit profanation. The people who commit profanation are those who know religious truth — especially those who acknowledge, profess, and preach it, and convince others it is true — and yet live a life of hatred, revenge, cruelty, larceny, and adultery. They also justify such behavior by numerous passages that they scrape together out of the Word, perverting them and immersing them in that same vile behavior. They are the ones committing profanation. These actions more than any others bring death on a person.<br />Evidence that such a practice incurs death can be seen in the fact that profane and holy matters remain completely separate in the other life — profane ones in hell and holy ones in heaven. When the kind of people just described enter the next life, sacred elements cling to profane ones in every single thought they think, the same as during physical life. Now, however, in the new setting, those people cannot present even a single holy idea without exposing something profane attached to it, just as clear as day. That is how it is in the next world when one person perceives another's thoughts. Profanation displays itself in every single thing such a person thinks, then, and since profanation fills heaven with horror, the profaner is inevitably thrust down into hell.<br />[2] Hardly anyone knows how our mental processes work. People think an idea is a simple thing, but each individual idea contains innumerable details linked together in many different ways, so that it is almost an image and thus a portrait of the person, which others perceive and observe in its entirety in the next life. To offer just a few examples:<br />When the idea of any place occurs to us — whether it is a whole region or a town or a building — then at the same time the thought and mental image of everything we have ever done there emerges, and spirits and angels see it all. Or if the thought of an individual we hated comes up, then at the same time an idea of every thought we harbored, every word we spoke, and every action we took against that person comes out.<br />The case is the same with our thoughts on all abstract issues. When our thoughts on a given subject come out, each and every idea that we conceived and that left its mark on us lies open to view. When our thinking on marriage comes up, for instance, then if we had been adulterers, all the filth and smut of adultery (even adultery we had merely imagined) comes out too. So do all the arguments we used for justifying adultery, whether they were based on the evidence of our senses, on a line of reasoning, or on the Word. So too do all the ways we adulterated and perverted the truth in the Word.<br />[3] Besides this, the idea of one thing bleeds into the idea of another and stains it, as if a scant drop of black dye released in water darkened the whole pool.<br />As a result, spirits are recognized by their thoughts, and amazing to say, every single idea they have is an image or model of them. When this image or model is presented to view, it is so ugly that looking at it would make you shudder.<br />This shows what the condition of those who profane holy things is like and what their image is like in the next life.<br />Those, however, who have believed implicitly in what the Word says can never be said to have profaned holy things even if they have believed what is not true, because the Word speaks according to appearances. (On this last subject, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1008/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_589" target=_top>589</a>.) </p>

Will I require the soul of man. That this means to avenge profanation, is evident from what has been said in the preceding verse and in this verse, for the subject is the eating of blood, by which is 
signified profanation. What profanation is, few know, and still less what its punishment is in the other life. Profanation is manifold. He who utterly denies the truths of faith does not profane them, 
as do not the nations which live outside of the church and of knowledges. But he profanes them who knows the truths of faith, and especially he who acknowledges them, bears them in his mouth, preaches 
them, and persuades others to adopt them, and yet lives in hatred, revenge, cruelty, robbery, and adultery, which he confirms in himself by many things that he extracts from the Word, perverting them 
and thus immersing them in these foul evils. He it is who profanes. And it is such profanity chiefly that brings death to a man, as may be evident from this, that in the other life what is profane 
and what is holy are entirely separated-what is profane in hell and what is holy in heaven. When such a man comes into the other life, in every idea of his thought, just as in the life of the body, what 
is holy adheres to what is profane. He cannot there bring forth a single idea of what is holy without what is profane being seen adhering, as clearly as in daylight, there is such perception of another's 
ideas in the other life. Thus in everything he thinks profanation is manifest, and since heaven abhors profanation, he cannot but be thrust down into hell.  [2] The nature of ideas is known to 
hardly anyone. It is supposed that they are something simple; but in each idea of thought there are things innumerable, variously conjoined so as to make a certain form, and hence pictured image of the 
man, which is all perceived and even seen in the other life. Merely for example-when the idea of a place occurs, whether of a country, a city, or a house, then an idea and image of all things the man 
has ever done there comes forth, and they are all seen by angels and spirits; or when the idea of a person whom he has held in hatred, then the idea comes forth of all things which he has thought, 
spoken, and done against him. And so it is with all other ideas; when they come up, all things in general and particular that he has conceived and impressed on himself in regard to the subject in question 
lie open to view. As when the idea of marriage arises, if he has been an adulterer, all filthy and obscene things of adultery, even of thought about it, come forth; likewise all things with which 
he has confirmed adulteries-whether from things of sense, from things of reason, or from the Word-and how he has adulterated and perverted the truths of the Word.  [3] Moreover, the idea of one thing 
flows into the idea of another and colors it, as when a little black is dropped into water and the whole volume of water is darkened. Thus is the spirit known from his ideas, and, wonderful to say, 
in every idea of his there is an image or likeness of himself, which when presented to view is so deformed as to be horrible to see. From this it is evident what is the state of those who profane holy 
things, and what is their appearance in the other life. But it can never be said that those profane holy things who in simplicity have believed what is said in the Word, even if they have believed what 
was not true; for things are said in the Word according to appearances, as may be seen above (n. 589). </p>

'Requiring the soul of man' is avenging profanation. This is clear from what has been stated in the previous verse and in the present one, for the subject is the eating of blood, which means profanation. 
Few know what profanation is, still less what the penalty for it may be in the next life. Profanation takes many forms. A person who totally denies the truths of faith does not profane them any more 
than gentiles do who live outside of the Church and outside of all knowledge of them. That person profanes however who does know the truths of faith, and still more one who acknowledges them, bears 
them on his lips, proclaims them, and persuades others of the truth of them, while at the same time he leads a life of hatred, revenge, cruelty, robbery, and adultery, and confirms such behaviour in 
himself by many statements which he scrapes together from the Word. He profanes by perverting the truths of faith, and so immerses them in those foul deeds. This is the person who profanes, and these 
are the things that above all else spell death to a person. That they spell death becomes clear from the fact that in the next life unholy things are completely separated from holy, the unholy being 
in hell, and the holy in heaven. When this type of person enters the next life, every idea within his thought contains holy things clinging to unholy, as it was during his lifetime. There he is unable 
to produce one idea of what is holy without the unholy that clings to it being seen clear as daylight; for such perception of another person's ideas exists in the next life. So in every detail of his 
thinking profanation manifests itself, and because heaven has such a horror of profanation he is inevitably forced down into hell. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The nature of ideas is hardly known to anyone. People imagine 
that there is nothing complex about them, when in fact every idea within thought contains countless elements variously linked together so as to produce a certain form and consequent picture image of 
the person, the whole of which is perceived and even seen with the eyes in the next life. Take this merely as an example: When the idea of a place comes to mind - whether of a region, or a city, or a 
house - the idea and an image of all the things the person has ever done in that place crop up at the same time, and spirits and angels see them all. Or, if the idea of somebody whom he has hated presents 
itself, the idea of all he has thought, said, and done against that person arises at the same time. The same applies to ideas of all things, but when these present themselves every single detail 
that he has conceived of and impressed upon himself regarding a particular matter becomes apparent. For instance, if he has been an adulterer, when the idea of marriage crops up, all the muck and filth 
of adultery, even of thought about it, does so too, likewise all the arguments used to confirm adulterous practices, whether based on the evidence of the senses, or on rational grounds, or on the Word. 
And the way in which he has adulterated and perverted the truths of the Word crops up too.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Furthermore, the idea of one thing merges into the idea of the next and colours it just as a tiny 
quantity of black placed in water darkens the whole volume of water. Consequently a spirit is recognized by his ideas, and what is remarkable, each one of his ideas bears his own image or likeness. When 
such an idea is presented visually it is so ugly that it is horrible to look at. All this makes clear the nature of the state of people who profane holy things, and the image they present in the next 
life. But people who in simplicity have believed statements made in the Word can never be said to profane holy things, not even if they have believed statements which are not literally true; for what 
is said in the Word is expressed in accordance with appearances, about which see <a href="589.htm">589</a>.  </p>

'Quaerere animam hominis': quod sit vindicare profanationem, constat ab illis quae in versu praecedente et ab iis quae in hoc versu dicta sunt; agitur enim de esu sanguinis, quo significata est profanatio. 
 Quid profanatio, pauci norunt, et minus quae ejus poena sit in altera vita: profanatio est multiplex; qui prorsus negat veritates fidei, non profanat, sicut gentes quae extra Ecclesiam et extra 
cognitiones vivunt; sed is profanat qui vera fidei novit, et adhuc magis qui agnoscit, ore fert, praedicat, et persuadet aliis, et tamen in odiis, vindictis, crudelitate, rapinis, et adulteriis vivit, 
et apud se confirmat talia pluribus quae ex Verbo corradit, pervertendo illa et sic immergendo foedis istis; is est qui profanat; haec sunt quae imprimis mortem homini inferunt; quod mortem inferant, 
constare potest inde quod in altera vita profana et sancta prorsus separata sint, profana in inferno, et sancta in caelo; cum talis in alteram vitam venit, in unaquavis ejus cogitationis idea, similiter 
ac in corporis vita, profanis sancta adhaerent, ubi tunc nec unam ideam sancti producere potest quin profanum adhaerens prorsus sicut in clara die conspiciatur; nam talis perceptio idearum alterius 
in altera vita datur; ita in singulis quae cogitat, exstat profanatio, et quia caelum horret profanationem, non potest aliter quam ut is in infernum detrudatur.  [2] Quomodo se ideae habent, vix 
aliquis novit, putant esse simplex quid; sed in unaquavis idea cogitatationis innumerabilia sunt diversimode conjuncta, ut sit quaedam forma et inde picta imago hominis, quae tota percipitur ut et conspicitur 
in altera vita; ut solum pro exemplis, cum idea loci obvenit, sive regio sit, sive urbs, sive domus, tunc idea et imago omnium quae usquam ibi patravit, simul prodit, quae omnia spiritus et angeli 
vident: aut si idea personae contra quem odium habuit, tunc idea omnium quae contra eum cogitavit, locutus est, et egit, simul prodit; similiter se habet cum ideis omnium rerum, quae cum prodeunt, 
omnia et singula quae de aliqua re concepit et sibi impressit, patent; ut quando idea conjugii, tunc si adulter fuit, omnia spurca et obscena adulterii, etiam cogitationis, prodeunt; similiter omnia 
quibus adulteria confirmavit sive ex sensualibus, sive ex rationalibus, sive ex Verbo, et quomodo vera Verbi adulteravit et pervertit; [3] et praeterea, idea unius rei influit in ideam alterius et eam 
inficit, quasi dum pusillum nigri in aquam mittitur, unde aquae volumen obscuratur: quare cognoscitur spiritus a suis ideis, et quod mirum, in unaquavis idea ejus est imago seu effigies ejus, quae 
dum sistitur spectanda, tam deformis est ut horror sit intueri: inde constare potest qualis status eorum, qui profanant sancta, et qualis imago eorum in altera vita.  Sed de illi nusquam dici potest quod 
profanent sancta, qui simpliciter crediderunt quae in Verbo, etiamsi crediderunt quae non vera sunt; nam in Verbo locutum est secundum apparentias, de quibus videatur n. 589. </p>
