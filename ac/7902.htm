<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7902节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7902.</strong>“你们要吃无酵饼”表良善对从虚假中洁净的真理的吸收。这从“吃”和“无酵”的含义清楚可知：“吃”是指变成人自己的，或吸收（参看<a href="2187.htm">2187</a>，<a href="2343.htm">2343</a>，<a href="3168.htm">3168</a>，<a href="3513.htm">3513</a>e，<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>，<a href="4745.htm">4745</a>节），之所以表示良善对真理的吸收，是因为真理被良善吸收，良善，如前面各处所示，从真理获得自己的具体品质，故为使真理变成人自己的，真理必须被良善吸收，为使良善变成人自己的，良善必须通过真理被吸收；“无酵”是指从一切虚假中洁净的真理（<a href="2342.htm">2342</a>节）。至于从一切虚假中洁净的真理，要知道，纯粹的真理永远不可能与人同在，既因为虚假不断从存在并固定在人里面的邪恶发出，还因为真理是相互联系的；因此，若有一个虚假存在，尤其多个虚假存在，剩下的真正真理就会由此被玷污，含有些许虚假在里面。不过，当一个人能被主保守在纯真的良善中时，可以说真理从虚假中洁净。纯真在于承认自己里面只有邪恶，一切良善皆来自主；还在于相信人凭自己什么也不知道，也什么觉察不到，包括信之真理，唯有靠主的帮助。当人处于这种状态时，虚假就能从他身上除去，真理能被主灌输进来。这种状态就是“无酵饼”，以及吃逾越节的羔羊所表示的。</p>

Ye shall eat things unleavened. That this signifies the appropriation by good, of truth purified from falsity, is evident from the signification of "to eat," as being appropriation (see n. 2187, 2343, 
3168, 3513, 3596, 4745), that it denotes the appropriation of truth by good, is because truth is appropriated by good, and good, as previously shown in various places, has its quality from truth, and 
therefore in order that truth may be appropriated it must be appropriated by good, and in order that good may be appropriated it must be appropriated through truth; and from the signification of "unleavened," 
as being truth purified from all falsity (n. 2342). As regards truths purified from all falsity, be it known that pure truth is never possible with man, both because falsity is continually 
flowing forth from the evil in which he is and which has its seat in him, and because truths have a mutual connection, and therefore if one be false, and especially if more than one, the remaining real 
truths are thence defiled, and partake somewhat of falsity. But truth is said to be purified from falsity when the man is capable of being kept by the Lord in the good of innocence. Innocence consists 
in acknowledging that in oneself there is nothing but evil, and that all good is from the Lord; and also in believing that man does not know or perceive anything from himself, but from the Lord, thus 
also the truth which is of faith. When man is in this state, then falsity can be removed from him, and truth can be instilled by the Lord. This state is what is signified by the unleavened things, 
and also by the eating of the paschal lamb. </p>

'You shall eat unleavened bread' means the assimilation by good of truth purified from falsity. This is clear from the meaning of eating as making one's own or assimilating, dealt with in <a href="2187.htm">2187</a>, <a href="2343.htm">2343</a>, <a href="3168.htm">3168</a>, <a href="3513.htm">3513</a> (end), <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>, <a href="4745.htm">4745</a> (the assimilation of truth by good is meant because truth is assimilated by good, and good - as shown in various places already - derives its specific quality from truth; 
therefore to make truth one's own truth must be assimilated by good, and to make good one's own good must be conditioned by truth); and from the meaning of what is 'unleavened' as truth purified from 
all falsity, dealt with in <a href="2342.htm">2342</a>. As regards truth purified from all falsity, it should be recognized that pure truth cannot ever reside with anyone. It cannot both because falsity issues constantly from 
the evil present and firmly fixed within him, and because the truths are interconnected; therefore if one falsity is present, worse still if a number are present, the actual truths remaining are consequently 
defiled and have something of falsity in them. But truth is said to be purified from falsity when a person can be preserved by the Lord in the good of innocence. Innocence consists in acknowledging 
that nothing but evil resides in oneself and that any good comes in from the Lord, and also in believing that one neither knows nor perceives anything, including the truth of faith, if left 
to oneself, only with the Lord's help. When this is a person s state falsity can be removed from him and truth instilled by the Lord. This state is what is meant by 'unleavened bread' and also by the 
eating of the Passover lamb. </p>

`Comedetis azyma': quod significet appropriationem veri {1}a bono purificati a falso, constat ex significatione `comedere' quod sit appropriatio, de qua n. 2187, 2343, 3168, 3513 fin., 3596, 4745; quod 
sit appropriatio veri {1}a bono, est quia {2}verum appropriatur a bono, et bonum, ut prius passim ostensum est, suum quale habet a vero, quare ut verum approprietur erit a bono, ac ut bonum, erit 
per verum; et ex significatione `azymi' quod sit verum purificatum ab omni falso, de qua n. 2342.  Quod verum purificatum ab omni falso attinet, sciendum quod apud hominem nusquam dari queat verum purum, 
tam quia a malo in quo {3}est et quod insidet, falsum continue profluit, quam quia vera inter se nexum (x)habent, et ideo, si unum falsum sit, magis si plura, ipsa vera reliqua inde conspurcantur 
et aliquid de falso trahunt; at verum dicitur purificatum a falso {4} cum homo {5}teneri potest a Domino in bono innocentiae; innocentia {6} est agnoscere quod apud se nihil nisi malum sit {7}, et quod 
omne bonum {8} a Domino; (m)tum {9}credere quod non sciat nec percipiat (c)a se aliquid sed ex Domino, ita quoque verum quod fidei;(n) cum homo in hoc statu est, tunc removeri potest falsum ab illo 
et {10} insinuari verum a Domino; hic status est qui significatur per `azyma' et quoque per esum agni paschalis. 	@1 in$ 	@2 bonum appropriatur per verum, nam ut prius passim ostensum est, bonum suum
