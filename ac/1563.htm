<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1563.</strong>“与亚伯兰同行的罗得”表居于主内的外在人。这从“罗得”代表感官人，或也可说，代表外在人清楚可知。在教会，众所周知，人皆有一个内在和一个外在，或也可说，一个内在人和一个外在人（对此，参看前面所述，<a href="978.htm">978</a>，<a href="994.htm">994</a>，<a href="995.htm">995</a>，<a href="1015.htm">1015</a>节）。外在人主要从内在人，即灵或灵魂那里接受生命。他的生命本身一般由此而来，这生命无法被外在人以具体和清晰的方式所接受，除非它的器官容器被打开，它们必须充当内在人具体和个体部分的接受者。这些要充当接受者的器官容器只能通过感官，尤其视听感官被打开；当它们被打开时，内在人及其具体和个体部分就能流进来。它们以感官为媒介，通过知识和认知，以及乐趣和快乐被打开；知识和认知是理解力之物，乐趣和快乐是意愿之物。<br />由这些事可以看出，所必然发生的情形是：诸如无法与属灵的真理一致的这类知识和认知会渗透到外在人中；诸如无法与属天的良善一致的这类乐趣和快乐也会渗透其中；这就是以肉体、世俗和尘世之物为目的的所有事物的情形；当这些事物被视为目的时，它们会向外、向下拖拽外在人，将其从内在人那里拉走。因此，除非这类事物首先被驱散，否则内在人决不会与外在人一致；所以，在内在人能与外在人一致之前，这类事物必须首先被移除。对主而言，这些事物的移除或分离由罗得与亚伯兰分离来代表和表示。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1563.</strong> The symbolism of and Lot too, who went with Abram, as the outer self that the Lord had can be seen from the representation of Lot as the sensory self or, what is the same, the outer self.<br />We each have an inward part and an outward part or, to put it another way, an inner self and an outer self, as everyone in the church knows;{*1} for more, see above at 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1563/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_978" target=_top>978</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1563/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994" target=_top>994</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1563/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_995" target=_top>995</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1563/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1015" target=_top>1015</a>.<br />The outer self receives its life chiefly from the inner self, that is, from its spirit, or soul. This is the origin of its actual life force as a general whole. That force cannot be received by the outer self in a detailed or distinct way unless there is an opening of its organic vessels, which are necessary for reception of the specific influences from the inner self, down to the most minute. These organic{*2} vessels necessary for reception are not opened up except by means of the senses 钬?mainly hearing and sight. When they do open, the inner self can enter in with its specific and minute details. Those vessels are opened by means of the senses through facts and religious knowledge (properties of the intellect), and also through appetites and pleasures (properties of the will).<br />[2] The plain and inevitable consequence is that the outer self will then be infiltrated by secular and religious concepts incompatible with spiritual truth and by appetites and pleasures incompatible with heavenly goodness. All the ones that focus on personal, worldly, and earthly rewards as their goals fall into this category. When we focus on them as our goals, they drag our outer self out toward the surface and downward. In this way they distance the outer self from the inner. If these distractions are not first dispelled, the inner self cannot possibly come into harmony with the outer self, so before the inner self can come into harmony with the outer self, such things must first be put aside.<br />The fact that they were put aside or separated in the Lord is represented and symbolized by Lot's separation from Abram.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The assertion that "everyone in the church knows" about how we have an inner and an outer self may be a reference to various passages on that subject in the Epistles; see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1563/bible_king-james-version_romans_7_22" target=_top>Romans 7:22</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1563/bible_king-james-version_2-corinthians_4_16" target=_top>2 Corinthians 4:16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1563/bible_king-james-version_ephesians_3_16" target=_top>Ephesians 3:16</a>.

And Lot also, who went with Abram. That this signifies the external man that was in the Lord, is evident from the representation of Lot, as being the sensuous man, or what is the same, the external man. 
That there is an internal and an external in every man, or what is the same, that man is internal and external, is known to everyone within the church (concerning which see what has been said before, 
n. 978, 994, 995, 1015). The external man receives its life principally from the internal man, that is, from the spirit or soul. Thence comes its very life in general; but this life cannot be received 
in its particulars, or distinctly, by the external man, unless its organic vessels are opened, which must be the recipients of the particulars and the singulars of the internal man. These organic 
vessels, which are to be the recipients, are not opened except by means of the senses, especially those of hearing and sight; and, as they are opened, the internal man can flow in with its particulars 
and singulars. They are opened with the senses as the media, by means of knowledges [scientifica et cognitiones], and also by means of pleasures and delights; those belonging to the understanding by 
means of knowledges, and those belonging to the will by means of pleasures and delights.  [2] From these things it may be seen that it must necessarily happen that such knowledges as cannot agree with 
spiritual truths will insinuate themselves into the external man; and that such pleasures and delights will insinuate themselves as cannot agree with celestial goods; as is the case with all those 
things which regard corporeal, worldly, and earthly things as the ends; which, when regarded as ends, draw the external man outward and downward, and so remove it from the internal man. Wherefore, unless 
such things are first dispersed, the internal man cannot possibly agree with the external; so that before the internal man can agree with the external, such things must first be removed. That with 
the Lord these things were removed or separated, is represented and signified by the separation of Lot from Abram. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1563</b></p><p><b>1563.</b>
That 'Lot also who went with Abram' means the external man residing in the Lord is clear from the representation of 'Lot' as the sensory man, or what amounts to the same, the external man. It is well 
known to everyone in the Church that everybody has an internal and an external, or what amounts to the same, that man is internal and external. For these matters, see what has appeared already in <a href="978.htm">978</a>, <a href="994.htm">994</a>, <a href="995.htm">995</a>, <a href="1015.htm">1015</a>. The external man receives his life principally from the internal, that is, from his spirit or soul. From there comes his life itself in general, which life cannot be received by the 
external man in a detailed and distinct manner unless his organic vessels are opened which are to serve as recipients of the particular and individual parts of the internal man. Those organic vessels 
that are to serve as recipients are not opened except by means of the senses, chiefly those of hearing and sight. And as they are so opened the internal man is able to flow in with the particular and 
individual parts. They are opened by means of the senses through facts and cognitions, as well as through pleasures and delights - the former being things of the understanding, the latter those of the 
will </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From these considerations it becomes clear that as an inevitable result facts and cognitions which cannot agree with spiritual truths will worm their way into the external man, and that pleasures 
and delights which cannot agree with celestial goods will worm their way in, even as all those things do which regard bodily, worldly, and earthly things as ends in themselves- which things when 
regarded as ends drag the external man outwards and downwards and so remove the external man from the internal man. For this reason unless such things have first been dispelled the internal man cannot 
in any way agree with the external, and therefore before the internal man is able to agree with the external such things have to be removed. The removal or separation of those things in the Lord 
is represented and meant by Lot's separation from Abram. </p>

'Et etiam Loto eunti cum Abramo': quod significet externum hominem qui apud Dominum, constat a repraesentatione 'Loti' quod sit sensualis homo, seu quod idem est, externus. Quod internum et externum 
sit apud unumquemvis hominem, seu quod idem, quod homo internus et externus sit, unicuique intra Ecclesiam notum est, de quibus videantur quae prius n. 978, 994, 995, 1015. Externus homo vitam suam principaliter 
accipit ab interno, hoc est, a spiritu seu ab anima ejus, inde est ipsamet ejus vita in communi, quae vita non singulariter seu distincte recipi potest ab externo homine nisi ejus organica 
vasa aperiantur quae erunt recipientia particularium et singularium interni hominis; vasa illa organica quae erunt recipientia, non aperiuntur nisi mediis sensibus qui imprimis sunt auditus et visus, 
et sicut aperiuntur ita influere potest internus homo cum particularibus et singularibus; aperiuntur mediis sensibus illa per scientifica et cognitiones, tum per voluptates et jucunditates; per illa 
quae intellectus sunt, per haec quae voluntatis: [2] ex his constare potest, quod nusquam aliter fieri queat quam quod apud externum hominem tunc se insinuent scientifica et cognitiones quae non concordare 
possunt cum veris spiritualibus, et quod se insinuent voluptates et jucunditates quae non concordare possunt cum bonis caelestibus; sicut omnia illa quae spectant corporea, mundana et terrestria 
ut fines, quae cum spectantur ut fines, tunc trahunt externum hominem extrorsum et deorsum, et sic removent ab interno; quare nisi talia prius discutiuntur, nequaquam potest internus homo concordare 
cum externo, ideo antequam concordare potest internus homo cum externo, talia prius removenda sunt. Haec quod remota aut separata sint apud Dominum, repraesentatur et significatur per Loti separationem 
ab Abramo. </p>
