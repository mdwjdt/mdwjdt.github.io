<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9188节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9188.</strong>“行邪术的女人”表那些教会的某种事物已经与自我之爱的邪恶所生的虚假结合在一起的人。这从“行邪术的女人”的含义清楚可知，“行邪术的女人”是指已经与诸如属于教会的那类事物相结合的自我之爱的邪恶所产生的虚假。有两样事物构成天堂，从而构成与人同在的属灵生命，即对主之信的真理和对主之爱的良善。有两样东西则构成地狱，从而构成与人同在的属灵死亡，即信之虚假和自我之爱的邪恶。后两者与地狱里的人结合在一起，并构成地狱的婚姻；而前两者与天堂里的人结合在一起，并构成天堂的婚姻。主尽可能地防止一个人将真理并良善与邪恶并虚假相结合，因为这种结合就是亵渎。即便如此，仍有大量属教会的人无法被阻止，原因在于，他们自幼儿的时候起，就从圣言和取自圣言的教义学习、吸收了属教会的事物。在这些人当中，有些人充满这类事物，并将它们变成自己信仰的对象；等到了成年他们开始独立思考，不再像以前那样依赖他人的时候，他们不再重视那些已经成为其信仰对象的东西；相反，他们抓住并充满虚假。他们就是那些在自己里面将真理与虚假联相结合的人；因为这些真理一旦变成信之真理，就会保留下来，无法根除；后来成为信仰对象的虚假则与这些真理结合起来。<br />这种结合就是“邪术或巫术”在内义上所表示的。这些虚假之所以是由自我之爱的邪恶所产生的虚假，是因为一切邪恶主要是从这爱涌出的；当邪恶涌出时，虚假也会涌出，因为它们互相粘附。由此明显可知，这些人里面没有属灵的生命，因为这生命已经被邪恶所生的虚假摧毁了；并且他们将这些虚假与真理结合到何等程度，就在何等程度上除灭他们里面的属灵生命。由于他们就这样死去，而不是活着，故经上说“不可容她们存活”。<br />在圣言中，“邪术”就表示这种结合，这一点明显可见于以赛亚书：<br />你说，我必不至寡居，也不知道丧子之事。哪知，丧子、寡居这两件事在一日转眼之间必临到你，因你多行邪术、广施符咒。向来倚靠自己的邪恶，说，无人看见我。你的智慧知识使你偏邪，并且你心里说，惟有我，除我以外再没有别的。因此，祸患要临到你，你不知如何避开；灾害落在你身上，你也不能弥补，你所不知道的毁灭也必忽然临到你身上。继续使用你从幼年就劳碌施行的符咒和你许多的邪术吧。你筹划太多，以致疲倦。让那些观天象的、看星宿的、知道新月的，都站起来，救你脱离所要临到你的事。看哪，他们必像碎秸，火必要焚烧他们；他们不能救自己脱离火焰之手。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.8.htm">47:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“行邪术的”是指那些将自我之爱的邪恶所生的虚假与信之真理相结合，并因此而灭亡的人。这一点从当以内义来观之时这些经文的细节明显看出来，因为此处描述的，就是这些人。其属灵生命的毁灭被描述为“寡居和丧子”：“寡居”是指对真理和真理所产生的良善的剥夺，“丧子”是对真理和良善的剥夺。由自我之爱的邪恶所产生的虚假，其起源以下面的话来描述：“你的智慧知识使你偏邪，并且你心里说，惟有我，除我以外再没有别的”。自我之爱的邪恶本身则这些话来描述：“看哪，他们必像碎秸，火必要焚烧他们；他们不能救自己脱离火焰之手”；“火”和“火焰”是指自我之爱。属灵生命的一切都已被毁，这一点以这些话来描述：“祸患要临到你，你不知如何避开；灾害落在你身上，你也不能弥补”。他们被称为“观天象的、看星宿的、知道新月的”，因为他们对外在事物感兴趣，对任何内在事物都不感兴趣。这种人从外在人的视角来看待事物，从从内在人的视角则什么也看不见；因此，他们在低劣的属世之光中看事物，在优越的属灵之光中则什么也看不见。因为就内义而言，“天象”、“星宿”和“新月”表示宗教知识和记忆知识，在此是指从世界而非天堂的视角所看到的那种。<br />“邪术”表示这种虚假，这一点也明显可见于弥迦书：<br />我必从你地中剪灭城邑，倾覆你一切的保垒；又必从你手中剪除邪术，你那里也不再有占卜的。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.11.htm">5:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.12.htm">12</a>）<br />“地的城邑”是指他们教会的虚假教义，这些教义之所以被称为“邪术”，是因为它们摧毁信之真理。那鸿书：<br />都因那美貌的妓女多有淫行，是行邪术的主母，以淫行出卖列族，以邪术出卖多个家族。（那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿3.4.htm">3:4</a>）<br />“淫行”是指对真理的歪曲；“邪术”是指由这些歪曲所产生的虚假。在列王纪下也一样：<br />约兰对耶户就说，耶户啊，平安吗？耶户说，你母亲耶洗别的淫行，这么多的邪术仍与我们同在，焉能平安呢？（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下9.22.htm">9:22</a>）<br />那些被自己教导，唯独信靠自己，以至于热爱自己并想要被当作神明来崇拜的人就是“行邪术的”。这一点从公开论及主降临的经文也明显看出来，主将教导他们，驱逐行邪术的。因为凡将要学习信之真理和良善的人必被主教导，绝不会被自己教导。这就是为何经上在玛拉基书如此记着说：<br />看哪！我差遣我的使者在我前面预备道路。你们所寻求的主，必忽然进入祂的殿；立约的使者，就是你们所仰慕的，快要来到。我必临近你们，施行审判。我必速速作见证，反对行邪术的、犯奸淫的、起假誓的。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.1.htm">3:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“行邪术的”是指那些被自己教导，从而摧毁从主所获得的真理之人；“犯奸淫的”是指那些摧毁良善的人；“起假誓的”是指那些证实虚假的人。正是主将他们逐出，这是显而易见的，因为经上说“主，甚至立约的使者必进入祂的殿”。<br />在摩西五经也是如此：<br />你到了耶和华你神所赐之地，你们中间不可有人使儿女经火，也不可有占卜的、求问地狱的、预言未来的、行邪术的、用法术的、问交鬼的、算命的和求问死人的。凡行这些事的，都为耶和华所憎恶；因这可憎恶的事，所以耶和华你的神将他们从你面前赶出。耶和华你的神要从你和你的弟兄中间给你兴起一位先知像我，你们要听从他。耶和华在何烈山说，我必在他们弟兄中间给他兴起一位先知像你。我要将我的话放在他口中；他要将我所所吩咐他的一切都对他们说。将来不听从我话，就是他奉我名所说的，我必追讨那人。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申18.9.htm">18:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申18.19.htm">19</a>）<br />“占卜的”、“、预言未来的”、“行邪术的”，以及此提到其他所有人，在内义上都表示那些通过错误使用记忆知识而摧毁教会的真理和良善的人，也就是说，那些倚靠自己的聪明、通过爱自己爱世界的邪恶所产生的虚假摧毁它们的人，因而那些出于对利益和重要地位的渴望，而不是出于对信仰的真理和生活的良善的任何情感而如此行的人。由于教义的一切虚假和生活的邪恶皆出自这一源头，所以这几节经文提到一位先知将要来教导他们。教会知道这位先知就是主，那时的犹太人和外邦人也知道，这一点明显可见于马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.11.htm">21:11</a>），路加福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.76.htm">1:76</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路7.16.htm">7:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.33.htm">13:33</a>）和马可福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/可6.4.htm">6:4</a>）。那些阅读圣言不是为了自己和世界，而是为了良善和真理本身的人就被主教导，因为这时他们被光照。但当他们为了自己和世界阅读圣言时，就变瞎了。“先知”表示施行教导的人，在从人抽象出来的意义上表示教义（<a href="2534.htm">2534</a>，<a href="7269.htm">7269</a>节），因而表示圣言，或神性真理方面的主。</p>

A sorceress. That this signifies those in whom something of the church has been conjoined with the falsities of the evil of the love of self, is evident from the signification of "sorceries," as being 
the falsities of the evil of the love of self conjoined with such things as are of the church. There are two things which make heaven and thus spiritual life with man-the truth of faith in the Lord, 
and the good of love to Him. And there are two things which make hell and thus spiritual death with man-the falsity of faith, and the evil of the love of self. The two latter are conjoined in those who 
are in hell, and make the infernal marriage; but the two former are conjoined in those who are in heaven, and make the heavenly marriage. So far as possible, the Lord withholds man from the conjunction 
of truth and good with falsity and evil, because this conjunction is profanation. Nevertheless many of those who are within the church cannot be withheld, because from early childhood they have learned 
the things of the church from the Word, and from doctrine drawn from the Word; and some of them have become imbued with such things, and have made them of their faith. When these persons have arrived 
at mature age, and have begun to think from themselves, and not as before from others, then they have made nothing of the things they had made of their faith, and in their stead have seized on 
falsities and imbued themselves with them. These are they who have conjoined within them truths with falsities; for those truths which have once become truths of faith remain, and cannot be rooted out; 
and the falsities which are afterward made of their faith conjoin themselves with them.  [2] It is this conjunction which is signified in the internal sense by "sorceries." The reason why these falsities 
are falsities of the evil of the love of self, is that all evil springs chiefly from this love, and together with evil, falsity, because they cohere together. From this it is evident that in such 
persons there is no spiritual life, because it has been destroyed by falsities of evil; and insofar as they have conjoined these falsities with truths, so far they have extinguished spiritual life 
within them; and as in this way instead of being alive, they have become dead, it is said, "Thou shalt not suffer them to live." [3] That the conjunction in question is signified in the Word by "sorceries," 
is plain in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     She said, I shall not sit a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children; but these two things shall come upon thee in a moment in one day, loss of children, and 
widowhood, because of the multitude of thy sorceries, because of the exceeding greatness of thy magical deeds. Thou hast trusted in thy wickedness; thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge 
have led thee astray; when thou saidst in thine heart, I am, and there is none else besides me. Therefore shall evil come upon thee which thou shalt not know how to ward off; and calamity shall 
fall upon thee which thou shalt not be able to atone: devastation shall come upon thee suddenly, thou not knowing. For indeed persist thou in thy magical deeds, and in the multitude of thy sorceries, 
wherein thou hast labored from thy youth. Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsel. Let the searchers of the heavens, the stargazers, and those who know the new moons, now stand and save thee 
from the things that shall come upon thee. Behold they are become as stubble; the fire hath burned them; they shall not rescue their soul from the hand of the flame (Isa. 47:8-14). [4] That "sorcerers" 
denote those who conjoin the falsities of the evil of the love of self with the truths of faith, and thus perish, is plain from every particular in the above passage viewed in the internal sense, 
for they are here described. The extinction of their spiritual life is described by "widowhood and loss of children." "Widowhood" denotes the privation of truth and of the derivative good; and "loss 
of children" the privation of truth and good. The origin of falsity, as being from the evil of the love of self, is described by these words, "thy wisdom and thy knowledge have led thee astray when thou 
saidst in thine heart, I am, and there is none else besides me;" and the evil itself of the love of self, by these words, "behold, they are become as stubble, the fire hath burned them, they shall 
not rescue their soul from the hand of the flame;" "fire" and "flame" denote the love of self. That everything of spiritual life has been extinguished, is described by these words, "evil shall come upon 
thee which thou shalt not know how to ward off, and calamity shall fall upon thee which thou shalt not be able to atone." They are called "searchers of the heavens, stargazers, and those who know the 
new moons," from being in external things without any internal; for such see from the external man and not at all from the internal, thus from natural light and not at all from spiritual light; for 
in the internal sense "heaven," the "stars," and "new moons" denote knowledges and memory-knowledges; here, such as are seen from the world, and not from heaven. [5] That "sorceries" denote such falsities, 
is also plain in Micah: </p>
<p>     I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strongholds; I will cut off sorceries out of thine hand; and thou shall have no soothsayers (Micah 5:11-12): </p>
<p>"the 
cities of the land" denote the false doctrinal things of their church, which are called "sorceries" because they destroy the truths of faith. In Nahum: </p>
<p>     Because of the multitude of 
the whoredoms of the well- favored* harlot, the mistress of sorceries, that selleth nations in her whoredom, and families in her sorceries (Nah. 3:4); </p>
<p>"whoredoms" denote perversions of truth; and "sorceries," 
the falsities thence derived. In like manner in the second book of Kings: </p>
<p>     Jehoram said unto Jehu, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, even unto the whoredoms of thy mother 
Jezebel, and her many sorceries? (2 Kings 9:22). [6] That those are "sorcerers" who have been taught by themselves, and trust in themselves alone to the extent of loving themselves and desiring to be 
worshiped as deities, is also plain from passages which treat openly of the coming of the Lord, who will teach them and cast out the sorcerers; for he who shall be taught in the truths and goods of 
faith must be taught by the Lord, and in no wise by himself. Wherefore it is thus written in Malachi: </p>
<p>     Behold I send Mine angel, who shall prepare the way before Me; and the Lord whom ye seek shall 
suddenly come to His temple, even the angel of the covenant whom ye desire. And I will draw nigh to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, 
and those who swear to what is false (Mal. 3:1, 5); </p>
<p>"sorcerers" denote those who have been taught by themselves, and who thus destroy truths which are from the Lord; "adulterers" denote those who destroy 
goods; and "those who swear to what is false," those who confirm falsities. That it is the Lord who will cast them out is plain, for it is said, "the Lord shall come to His temple, even the angel 
of the covenant." [7] So also in Moses: </p>
<p>     When thou comest unto the land which Jehovah God will give thee, there shall not be found in thee anyone that maketh his son or his daughter pass through 
the fire, one that divineth divinations, and one that questioneth the hells, and an augur, and a sorcerer, and an enchanter, and one that consulteth a familiar spirit, and a soothsayer, and a questioner 
of the dead. For everyone that doeth these things is an abomination to Jehovah; and because of these abominations Jehovah thy God doth drive them out from before thee. Jehovah thy God will raise 
up to thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; him shall ye obey. Jehovah said in Horeb, I will raise him up a prophet from the midst of their brethren, like unto thee; and 
I will put My words in his mouth, that he may speak unto them all that I shall command him. Whence it shall come to pass that the man who will not obey My words, which he shall speak in My name, I 
will require it of him (Deut. 18:9-19). [8] By "diviners," "augurs," "sorcerers," and the rest who are here named, are meant in the internal sense those who destroy the truths and goods of the church 
by means of memory-knowledges wrongly applied; thus who do so from their own intelligence and through falsities from the evils of the love of self and the love of the world, consequently who learn and 
teach from the cupidity of profit and of honors, and not from any affection for the truth of faith and the good of life. And as all falsities of doctrine and evils of life come forth from this source, 
mention is made of "a prophet who shall come and teach." That this "prophet" is the Lord, is known in the church, and was known also to the Jews and Gentiles of that time, as is evident in Matthew 
21:11; Luke 1:76; 7:16; 13:33; Mark 6:4. Those are taught by the Lord who read the Word not for the sake of self and the world, but for the sake of good and truth itself, for then they are enlightened. 
But when men read it for the sake of self and the world, they are blinded. "A prophet" signifies one who teaches, and in a sense abstracted from person, doctrine (n. 2534, 7269); thus the Lord as to 
the Word, that is, as to Divine truth. * Here boni causa, but in n. 6978 boni gratia. [Reviser.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9188</b></p><p><b>9188.</b>
'A sorceress' means those with whom something of the Church has been joined to falsities arising from the evil of self-love. This is clear from the meaning of 'sorceries' as falsities arising from the 
evil of self-love which have been joined to such things as belong to the Church. There are two things that compose heaven and so compose spiritual life with a person - the truth of faith in the Lord 
and the good of love to Him. And there are two things that compose hell and so compose spiritual death with a person - the falsity of faith and the evil of self-love. The second two have been joined 
together with those in hell and constitute the hellish marriage, whereas the first two are joined together with those in heaven and constitute the heavenly marriage. So far as possible the Lord withholds 
a person from joining truth and good to falsity and evil, since such a joining together is profanation. Even so, a large number of those who belong to the Church cannot be withheld, the reason for 
this being that from the time they were young children they have absorbed from the Word and from teachings drawn from the Word such things as belong to the Church. Some of these people have embraced 
them and made them matters of their own faith; and then having reached adult life when they start to think for themselves and not rely on others as they had done previously, they have set no value on 
those things which have become matters of their faith and instead of them have seized on and also embraced falsities. These are the ones who have within themselves joined truths to falsities; for once 
truths have become matters of faith they remain and cannot be rooted out, and after that falsities which become matters of faith join themselves to those truths.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This joining together is what 
is meant in the internal sense by 'sorceries'. The reason why those falsities are falsities arising from the evil of self-love is that all evil wells up chiefly from that love; and when evil wells up, 
so too does falsity since they cling to each other. From this it is evident that no spiritual life exists with such people because it has been destroyed by falsities arising from evil. To the extent 
that they have joined those falsities to truths these people have wiped out the spiritual life they have within themselves. And since they have thus become dead instead of living it says 'you shall not 
keep them alive'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that this kind of joining together is meant in the Word by 'sorceries' is evident in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
You said,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> A widow I shall not sit, nor shall I know loss of children. 
But these two things will come to you in a moment in one day - loss of children and widowhood - on account of the multitude of your sorceries, on account of the extremely great abundance of your 
magic. You have trusted in your wickedness; you have said, No one sees me. Your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, when you said in your heart, I am, and there is no one else like me. Therefore 
evil will come upon you, which you will not know how to ward off, and calamity will befall you, which you will not be able to expiate. Devastation will come upon you suddenly, [which] you will not know. 
Persist now in your magic, and in the multitude of your sorceries, in which you have laboured from your youth. You are wearied with the multitude of your counsels. Let those who search the sky, those 
who gaze at the stars, and those who know about new moons now stand up and save you from those things that will come upon you. Behold, they have become as stubble, the fire has burned them; they 
do not save themselves from the power of the flame.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2047:8-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 47:8-14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 'Sorcerers' are people who join falsities arising from the evil of self-love to the truths of faith, and in so doing perish. 
This is evident from the details of these verses when seen in the internal sense; for such people are described there. The annihilation of their spiritual life is described by 'widowhood and loss of 
children', 'widowhood' being the deprivation of truth and of the good resulting from it, and 'loss of children' being the deprivation of truth and good. The origin of falsity - that it arises from the 
evil of self-love - is described by the following words, 'Your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, when you said in your heart, I am, and there is no one else like me'. And the evil itself of self-love 
is described by 'Behold, they have become as stubble, the fire has burned them; they do not save themselves from the power of the flame', 'the fire' and 'the flame' being self-love. The fact 
that spiritual life has been completely annihilated is described by 'Evil will come upon you, which you will not be able to ward off, and calamity will befall you, which you will not be able to expiate'. 
They are called 'those who search the sky, those who gaze at the stars, and those who know about new moons' because they are interested in external things and not in anything internal. Such people 
see things from the external man's point of view and nothing from the internal man's; thus they see things in inferior, natural light and nothing in superior, spiritual light. For 'the sky', 'the stars', 
and 'new moons' in the internal sense mean religious and factual knowledge, in this instance when seen from a worldly and not a heavenly point of view.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The fact that 'sorceries' means this 
kind of falsities is also evident in Micah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will cut off the cities of your land and pull down all your fortifications; I will cut off sorceries from your hand, and you will have no soothsayers. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%205:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 5:11, 12</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The cities of your land' are the false teachings of their Church, which are called 'sorceries' because they destroy the truths of faith. In Nahum,  </p>
<blockquote>
... because of the multitude 
of the acts of whoredom of a harlot with goodly grace,<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> the mistress of sorceries, the seller of nations in her acts of whoredom, and of families in her sorceries. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Nahum%203:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Nahum 3:4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The acts of whoredom' 
are perversions of truth, 'sorceries' falsities resulting from them. Similarly in the second Book of Kings,  </p>
<p>Jehoram said to Jehu, Is all well,<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> Jehu? And he said, All well?<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> when the 
harlotries of Jezebel your mother, and her many sorceries are still with us! <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 9:22.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 People are sorcerers when they rely on their own ideas to teach them, and when they trust themselves 
alone to such an extent that they love themselves and wish to be worshipped as deities. This is also evident from places which openly refer to the Coming of the Lord, who will teach them and cast out 
sorcerers. For anyone who is going to learn about the truths and forms of the good of faith must rely on the Lord to teach him and not at all on his own ideas. This is why the following is stated in 
Malachi,  </p>
<p>Behold, I am sending My angel, who will prepare the way before me. And suddenly there will come to His temple the Lord whom you seek, and the angel of the covenant in whom you delight. And 
I will draw near to you to judgement; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against adulterers, and against those who swear falsely. Mal. 3:1, <a href="4.htm">4</a>, <a href="5.htm">5</a>.  </p>
<p>'The sorcerers' stands for 
those who rely on their own ideas to teach them and in so doing destroy truths received from the Lord. 'Adulterers' stands for those who destroy forms of good, and 'those who swear falsely' for those 
who corroborate falsities. The fact that the Lord is the one who will cast them out is self-evident, for it says that 'there will come to His temple the Lord, and the angel of the covenant'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
Also in Moses,  </p>
<p>When you come to the land which Jehovah [your] God will give you, there shall not be found among you anyone who makes [his] son or his daughter pass through the fire, practises divination, 
or enquires of the hells, or is a foreteller of the future, or is a sorcerer, or is an enchanter, or enquires of a familiar spirit, or is a soothsayer, or is one who seeks the dead. For everyone 
doing these things is an abomination to Jehovah; and because of these abominations Jehovah your God is driving them out before you. Jehovah your God will raise up for you from the midst of you, from 
your brothers, a Prophet like me; Him you shall obey. Jehovah said in Horeb, I will raise up for them a Prophet like you from the midst of their brothers; and I will put My words in His mouth, that 
He may speak to them all that I command Him. Therefore it will happen, that a man who does not obey My words which He speaks in My name, I will require it of him. Deut. 18:9-19.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 'Practisers of 
divination', 'foretellers of the future', 'sorcerers', and all the others mentioned here, mean in the internal sense those who destroy the Church's truths and forms of good by a wrong use of factual 
knowledge (that is, who do so by relying on their own intelligence) and who destroy them by falsities arising from the evils of self-love and love of the world (that is, who are moved to learn and teach 
by a desire for gain and important positions, not by any affection for the truth of faith or for goodness of life). And since all falsities contained in religious teachings and all evils of life are 
the outcome of this, these verses speak of a Prophet who is going to come and teach them. The Church knows that this Prophet is the Lord, and Jews and gentiles at that time knew it too, as is evident 
in Matthew 21:11; Luke 1:76; 7:16; 13:33; Mark 6:4. People are taught by the Lord when they read the Word not for any selfish or worldly reason but for goodness and truth's own sake; for they are enlightened 
then. But when they read it for a selfish or worldly reason they are blind. 'A prophet' means one who teaches, and in the abstract sense withdrawn from ideas of persons means doctrinal teachings, <a href="2534.htm">2534</a>, <a href="7269.htm">7269</a>, thus the Lord in respect of the Word or Divine Truth.

`Praestigiatricem': quod significet illos apud quos aliquid Ecclesiae conjunctum est falsis mali amoris sui, constat ex significatione `praestigiarum' quod sint falsa mali amoris sui conjuncta cum talibus 
quae {1} Ecclesiae; sunt duo quae faciunt caelum, ita vitam spiritualem apud hominem, verum fidei in Dominum et bonum amoris in Ipsum, et sunt duo quae faciunt infernum, ita mortem spiritualem 
apud hominem, falsum fidei et malum amoris sui; haec duo conjuncta sunt apud illos qui in inferno sunt et faciunt conjugium infernale, illa vero duo sunt conjuncta apud illos qui in caelo sunt et faciunt 
conjugium caeleste; Dominus, quantum fieri potest, detinet hominem a conjunctione veri et boni cum falso et malo, (o)quia haec conjunctio est profanatio; sed usque non detineri possunt plures ab illis 
qui in Ecclesia sunt; causa est quia ab infantia sua hauserunt talia quae Ecclesiae sunt ex Verbo (c)et ex doctrina e Verbo, et quidam eorum imbuerunt illa et fecerunt fidei suae; hi cum ad aetatem 
adultam pervenerunt, quando non ut prius ex aliis sed ex semet cogitare (x)coeperunt, tunc illa quae fidei eorum facta sunt nihili fecerunt et pro illis arripuerunt falsa, et quoque imbuerunt; illi 
sunt qui apud se conjunxerunt vera falsis, nam vera quae semel fidei facta sunt manent, nec possunt eradicari, et falsa quae dein fidei fiunt conjungunt se cum illis; haec conjunctio est quae in sensu 
interno significatur per `praestigias.' 	[2] Quod falsa illa sint falsa mali amoris sui, est quia omne malum ab illo amore principaliter scaturit, et cum malum etiam falsum, quoniam {2} cohaerent. 
 Inde patet quod apud tales vita spiritualis nulla sit quia destructa per falsa mali; et quantum conjunxerunt {3} falsa illa veris, tantum vitae spiritualis apud se exstinxerunt {4}; et quia sic mortui 
pro vivis facti sunt, dicitur quod illos non vivificabis. 	[3] Quod illa conjunctio per `praestigias' in Verbo significetur', patet apud Esaiam, 	Dixisti {5}, Non sedebo vidua, nec cognoscam orbitatem; 
at venient tibi duo illa momento in die uno, orbitas et viduitas, propter multitudinem praestigiarum tuarum, propter magnitudinem magiarum tuarum valde; confisa (x)es in malitia tua, dixisti, Non 
videns me; sapientia tua et scientia tua seduxit te, cum dixisti in corde tuo, Ego, et non sicut ego praeterea; ideo veniet super te malum quod non scies {6} deprecari, et cadet super te calamitas quam 
non poteris expiare; veniet super te subito devastatio, non scies {7}; persta namque in magiis tuis, et in multitudine praestigiarum tuarum, in quibus laborasti a juventute tua.  Defatigata es multitudine 
consilii tui; stent nunc et salvent te scrutatores caeli {8}, videntes stellas, (o)et cognoscentes novilunia, ab illis quae venient super te; ecce facti sunt sicut stipula, ignis adussit eos, 
non eripiunt animam suam e manu flammae, xlvii 8-14; </p>
<p>[4] quod `praestigiatores' sint qui conjungunt falsa mali (x)amoris sui veris fidei et sic pereunt, patet a singulis ibi in sensu interno spectatis, 
describuntur enim ibi; exstinctio vitae spiritualis (c)illorum describitur per `viduitatem et orbitatem'; `viduitas' est privatio veri et inde boni {9}, `orbitas' est privatio veri et boni; falsi 
origo, quod sit ex malo amoris sui, describitur per haec, `Sapientia tua et scientia tua seduxit te, cum dixisti in corde tuo, Ego, et non sicut ego praeterea,' et ipsum malum amoris sui (o)per haec, 
`Ecce facti sunt sicut stipula, ignis adussit eos, non eripiunt animam suam e manu flammae'; `ignis' et `flamma' est amor sui; quod omne vitae spiritualis exstinctum sit, per haec, `Veniet super te malum 
quod non poteris deprecari, et cadet super te calamitas quam non poteris expiare'; dicuntur illi `scrutatores caeli, videntes stellas, (o)et cognoscentes novilunia' ex eo quod in externis absque interno 
(x)sint, nam tales ab externo homine et nihil ab interno vident, ita a naturali lumine et nihil a spirituali luce; `caelum' enim, `stellae,' et (x)`novilunia' in sensu interno sunt cognitiones 
et scientifica, (o)hic quae spectantur e mundo et non e caelo. 	[5] Quod `praestigiae' talia falsa sint, etiam patet apud Micham, 	Exscindam urbes terrae tuae et destruam omnia munimenta tua, exscindam 
praestigias e manu tua, et arioli non erunt tibi, v 10, 11 [A.V. 11, 12]; </p>
<p>`urbes terrae tuae' sunt falsa doctrinalia Ecclesiae eorum, quae vocantur `praestigiae' quia destruunt vera fidei: apud Nahum, 	Prae 
multitudine scortationum scorti boni causa, magistrae {10} praestigiarum, (x)vendentis gentes in scortationibus suis, et familias in praestigiis suis, iii 4; </p>
<p>`scortationes' sunt perversiones 
veri, `praestigiae' sunt falsa {11} inde: similiter in Libro 2 Regum, 	Jehoramus dixit ad Jehu, Num pax Jehu? qui dixit, Quid pax, usque ad scortationes Isabelis matris tuae, et praestigias ejus 
multas? ix (x)22. 	[6] Quod illi praestigiatores sint qui docti sunt a se, confidunt sibi solis eo quod se ament, et velint ut numina coli, patet etiam {12} ex locis ubi aperte agitur de Adventu Domini, 
Qui docebit illos, et praestigiatores ejiciet; nam qui doctus erit in veris et bonis fidei, a Domino doctus erit et nullatenus a se; quare ita apud Malachiam, 	Ecce Ego mittens angelum Meum, qui 
parabit viam ante Me; et subito veniet ad templum Suum Dominus Quem vos quaeritis, et angelus foederis quem vos desideratis: et accedam ad vos in judicium; et ero testis festinans in praestigiatores, 
et in adulteros, et in jurantes falso, iii 1, 4, 5; </p>
<p>`praestigiatores' pro illis qui docti sunt a se et sic destruunt vera quae a Domino, `adulteri' pro illis qui destruunt bona, et ` (x)jurantes falso' 
pro illis qui confirmant falsa; quod Dominus sit Qui illos ejiciet, patet, nam dicitur quod `veniet ad templum Suum Dominus, et angelus (x)foederis': [7] (o)etiam apud Moschen, 	Cum venis {13} ad 
terram quam Jehovah Deus daturus tibi, non invenietur in te, qui traducat filium aut filiam suam per ignem, divinans divinationes, et interrogans inferna, et augurator, et praestigiator, et incantator, 
et interrogans pythonem, et ariolus, et quaerens mortuos; nam abominatio Jehovae omnis faciens illa; et propter abominationes has Jehovah Deus tuus expellens illos coram te.  Prophetam de medio tui, 
de fratribus tuis, sicut me, excitabit tibi Jehovah Deus tuus; Ipsi oboedietis; dixit Jehovah in Chorebo, Prophetam excitabo illis e medio fratrum illorum, sicut te, et dabo verba Mea in ore Ipsius, 
ut loquatur ad eos omne quod praecepero Ipsi; unde fiet vir qui non oboediverit verbis Meis quae loquetur in nomine Meo, Ego quaeram ex illo, Deut. xviii 9-19; </p>
<p>[8] per `divinatores, auguratores, praestigiatores,' 
et reliquos qui ibi nominantur, in sensu interno intelliguntur qui destruunt vera et bona Ecclesiae per scientifica perverse applicata, (o)ita qui ex propria intelligentia, perque {14} 
falsa ex malis amorum sui et mundi, ita qui ex cupiditate lucri et honorum discunt et docent et non ex affectione veri fidei et boni vitae; et quia inde omnia falsa doctrinae et mala vitae {15} existunt, 
ideo dicitur de Propheta qui venturus et docebit; quod ille Propheta sit Dominus, notum est in Ecclesia, et quoque notum fuit Judaeis et gentibus illo tempore, ut patet apud Matthaeum xxi 11; Luc. 
i 76, vii 16, xiii 33; Marc. vi 4.  Docentur a Domino cum non propter se et mundum sed propter ipsum bonum et verum {16} legunt Verbum, nam tunc illustrantur; cum autem propter se et mundum, tunc (x)occaecantur.
