<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4027节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4027.</strong>就这些话的内义而言，此处所透露的奥秘太过于内在，因而太过于深奥，以至于没有显露出来，被理解力或认知看到。因为就至高意义而言，所论述的主题是主，即祂如何将自己的属世层变成神性；就代表意义而言，即祂如何在重生人时，使他的属世层变成新的。所有这些事在此都充分体现在内义中。<br />就至高意义而言，此处所包含有关主的细节，即祂如何将自己里面的属世层变成神性，甚至超出天使的理解。有关它们的某些信息可见于人的重生，因为人的重生就是主荣耀的形像（<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3212.htm">3212</a>，<a href="3296.htm">3296</a>，<a href="3490.htm">3490</a>节）。诚然，人可以对这种重生拥有某种概念（不过，只有重生之人才能拥有），但只要活在肉身，就只能拥有一种模糊的概念。因为占据他注意力的肉体和世俗事物不断在他的心智上投下阴影，将其拘守于低级事物。但那些尚未重生的人则根本理解不了这个问题；他们缺乏有关它的一切知识，因为他们缺乏对它的任何觉察。事实上，他们完全不知道什么叫重生；也不相信有重生的可能性。他们甚至不知道何为仁爱的情感，然而，重生就是藉着仁爱的情感实现的；因此，他们也不知道何为良知，更不知道何为内在人，尤其不知道何为内在人与外在人的对应。诚然，他们或许知道这些话，并且许多人的确知道它们，但他们对这个事情本身一无所知。因此，由于他们甚至缺乏对这些事的某种概念，故包含在此处内义中的奥秘无论如何清楚地呈现给他们，这种呈现仍像是在黑暗中展示某种东西，或像是对着聋子说话。此外，在他们身上占据主导地位的自我之爱和尘世之爱的情感也不允许他们知道，甚至不允许他们听到这种话，因为他们会立刻拒绝它们，事实上把它们吐出去。那些处于仁爱情感的人则迥然不同。他们以这类事为快乐；因为与他们同在的天使在此人意识到这个奥秘时，会体验到他们自己的幸福。原因在于，这时，他们也会意识到与他们住在其中的主有关的事，以及与邻人及其重生有关的事。当处于仁爱情感的人阅读这些话，特别是相信它们里面有神圣之物，尤其还能理解包含在内义中的某种事物时，快乐和幸福就从天使，也就是从主经由天使流入。<br />此处所论述的主题是：主进入内在人的良善，事实上经由良善进入那里的真理的流注；以及由此进入外在人或属世人的流注；对良善与真理的情感，流注便进入这情感；还有对真理的接受并真理与那里的良善的结合；另外由此处“拉班”及其“羊群”所表示的、充当一种手段的良善。关于这些事，处于圣言内义的天使（对他们来说，内义就是圣言）则看见并觉察到无数细节。但几乎没有任何一个细节会进入人的理解范畴；凡进入其中的，也都掉进其模糊部分，这就是为何这些事无法详细解释的原因。</p>

The things which have been here unfolded as to the internal sense of the words, are too interior and too arcane to admit of being clearly set forth to the understanding. For the subject treated of in 
the supreme sense is the Lord, how He made His natural Divine; and in the representative sense, how He makes man's natural new when He regenerates him. All these things are here fully presented in the 
internal sense.  [2] The things here contained in the supreme sense concerning the Lord, how by His own power He made the natural in Himself Divine, are such as surpass even the angelic understanding. 
Something of them may be seen in the regeneration of man, because man's regeneration is an image of the Lord's glorification (n. 3138, 3212, 3296, 3490). Of this regeneration man may have some idea 
(no one, however, except the man who has been regenerated), but only an obscure idea so long as he lives in the body; for the corporeal and worldly things in which even such a man is, continually cast 
shadows on his mind and keep it in lower things. But they who have not been regenerated can have no apprehension of the matter, being without knowledges because without perceptions; nay, they know 
nothing whatever of what regeneration is, nor do they believe that it is possible. They do not even know what the affection of charity is by means of which regeneration is effected; and therefore they 
do not know what conscience is; still less what the internal man is; and less still what is the correspondence of the internal man with the external. The words they may indeed know, and many do know 
them, but they are ignorant of the thing. Seeing therefore that even the idea of these things is wanting, however clearly the arcana here contained in the internal sense should be set forth, it would 
still be like presenting something to sight in the dark, or telling something to the deaf. Moreover, the affections of the love of self and of the world that reign with them do not permit them to know, 
nor even to hear such things; for they immediately reject them, nay, spew them out. Very different is the case with those who are in the affection of charity. These are delighted with such things; for 
the angels with them are in their happiness when the man is in them, because they are then in things that treat of the Lord, in whom they are; and also in those which treat of the neighbor and his 
regeneration. From the angels (that is, through the angels from the Lord) delight and bliss flow in with the man who is in the affection of charity while reading these things, and more so when he believes 
what is holy to be within them, and still more when he apprehends anything of that which is contained in the internal sense.  [3] The subject here treated of is the influx of the Lord into the good 
of the internal man, and indeed through the good into the truth therein; also the influx therefrom into the external or natural man, and the affection of good and truth into which the influx takes 
place; and also the reception of truth and its conjunction with the good therein; and likewise the good that serves as a means, here signified by "Laban" and his "flock." Concerning these subjects the 
angels, who are in the internal sense of the Word, or to whom the internal sense is the Word, see and perceive innumerable things of which scarcely anything can come to man's understanding; and that 
which does come to it falls into his obscurity-which is the reason why these things are not explained more particularly. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4027</b></p><p><b>4027.</b>
The arcana presented up to this point in the explanation of the internal sense of the words used in this section are more interior ones and are therefore too deep to be laid bare and then be seen by 
the understanding. For the subject in the highest sense is the Lord - how He Himself made His Natural Divine; and in the representative sense it deals with how man's natural is made new by the Lord when 
He regenerates him. All this is presented fully at this point in the internal sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The details contained here in the highest sense concerning the Lord and how He Himself by His own power made 
Divine His Natural are such that they go beyond even that which angels can understand. Something of what they are may be seen in the regeneration of man, for the regeneration of man is an image of 
the Glorification of the Lord, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3212.htm">3212</a>, <a href="3296.htm">3296</a>, <a href="3490.htm">3490</a>. Some idea of this subject may indeed be had by man, but not by anyone other than a regenerate person, and even then only an obscure idea as long 
as he is living in the body. For bodily and worldly matters which occupy his attention constantly cloud his mind and confine it to lower things. But those who are not regenerate are not able to grasp 
anything at all of the subject; they are devoid of all knowledge of it because they are devoid of any perception of it. Indeed they are totally unaware of what regeneration is, and do not believe in 
the possibility of it. They do not even know what the affection belonging to charity is by which regeneration is accomplished, nor consequently what conscience is, still less what the internal man is, 
and least of all what the correspondence of the internal man with the external is. They may, it is true, know - and many do know - the words that are used, but they know nothing of the subject itself. 
Consequently when they lack even some notion of these, then no matter how clearly the arcana contained in the internal sense at this point are presented to them, such a presentation would be like something 
displayed in the dark or like something spoken to the deaf. What is more, the affections belonging to self-love and love of the world which reign with them do not allow them to know or even to 
hear of such arcana, for they instantly reject them; indeed they loathe them. It is different with people who are stirred by the affection belonging to charity. They are delighted with such things; for 
the angels present with those people experience their own angelic happiness when a person is conscious of such arcana, the reason being that they too are then conscious of things to do with the Lord 
in whom they abide, and of things to do with the neighbour and his regeneration. From the angels, that is, from the Lord by way of the angels, joy and blessing flow in when anyone who is stirred by 
the affection belonging to charity reads those things, more so when he believes that holiness lies within them, and more so still when he grasps something contained in the internal sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The matter 
under consideration at this point is the influx of the Lord into the good of the internal man, and indeed through the good into the truth there. Also under consideration are: the influx from there 
into the external or natural man; the affection for good and truth, into which affection the influx takes place; the reception of truth and the joining of it to the good there; and in addition, the 
good which serves as a means and is meant here by 'Laban and his flock'. Of these matters the angels, who are aware of the internal sense of the Word - that is, for whom the internal sense is the Word 
- see and perceive countless details. But scarcely any of those details come within the range of man's understanding, and those which do come within it pass into the unlit part, which is why these matters 
are not being explained in any greater detail. </p>

Haec quae hactenus quoad sensum internum vocum explicata sunt, interiora sunt, et inde arcaniora quam ut possint ad intellectum clare exponi; agitur enim in sensu supremo de Domino quomodo Ipse Naturale 
Suum Divinum fecit; et in sensu repraesentativo, quomodo Dominus naturale hominis novum facit cum illum regenerat; omnia illa sistuntur hic plene in sensu interno: </p>
<p>[2] quae ibi continentur 
in sensu supremo de Domino quomodo Ipse Naturale apud Se ex propria potentia Divinum fecit, sunt talia quae intellectum etiam angelicum excedunt; aliquid de illis in regeneratione hominis {1}videri 
potest, quia regeneratio hominis est imago Glorificationis Domini, n. 3138, 3212, 3296, 3490 de hac aliquam ideam habere potest homo, at non alius quam qui regeneratus est, sed tamen obscuram quamdiu 
in corpore vivit; corporea enim et mundam in quibus etiam est, jugiter affundunt umbras, ac detinent mentem in inferioribus; sed illi qui non regenerati sunt, nihil prorsus de illa re capere possunt; 
extra cognitiones sunt quia extra perceptiones; immo nesciunt prorsus quid regeneratio, nec credunt dari posse, ne quidem sciunt quid affectio charitatis per quam regeneratio {2}, inde nec quid 
conscientia, minus adhuc quid internus homo, et adhuc minus quid correspondentia interni hominis cum externo; verba quidem scire possunt et plures sciunt, sed rem ignorant; quapropter cum notio 
harum rerum deest, utcumque clare exponerentur arcana quae in sensu interno hic continentur, usque foret sicut aliquid ad visum sistere in tenebris, aut aliquid loqui ad surdos; et praeterea affectiones 
amoris sui et mundi quae apud illos regnant, (x)talia nec scire, ne quidem audire sinunt, rejiciunt enim ilico, immo respuunt; aliter qui in affectione charitatis sunt, ii delectantur talibus, 
nam angeli apud illos in suo felici sunt cum homo in talibus est, ex causa quia tunc in illis sunt quae agunt de Domino in Quo sunt, et in illis quae agunt de proximo et de ejus regeneratione; ex 
angelis, hoc est, per angelos a Domino, influit jucundum et beatum apud hominem qui in affectione charitatis est, cum illa legit, et magis cum sanctum illis inesse credit, et adhuc magis cum aliquid 
capit quod in sensu interno continetur.  [3] Agitur ibi de influxu Domini in bonum interni hominis, et quidem per bonum in verum ibi; agitur etiam de influxu inde in externum seu naturalem hominem, 
et de affectione (t)boni et veri in quam fit influxus, et quoque de receptione veri et de ejus conjunctione cum bono ibi, praeter de bono quod pro medio inservit, et hic per `Labanem et ejus gregem' 
significatur.  De his angeli, qui in sensu interno Verbi sunt, seu quibus sensus internus est Verbum, innumerabilia vident et percipiunt, quorum vix aliquid ad intellectum hominis venire potest, 
et quod venit, in obscurum ejus cadit, quae causa est quod haec non singularius explicentur. @1 i ut in imagine$ @2 i sit or perhaps fit$ </p>
