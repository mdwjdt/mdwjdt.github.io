<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4903节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4903.</strong>“说，你的儿媳他玛作了妓女”表此时的一种觉知，即：若说他们之间存在任何婚姻之物，这是一种虚假。这从“说”、“作了妓女”和“儿媳”的含义，以及“他玛”的代表清楚可知：在圣言的历史部分，“说”是指觉知，如前所述（<a href="4892.htm">4892</a>节）；“作了妓女”是指虚假（<a href="2466.htm">2466</a>，<a href="2729.htm">2729</a>，<a href="3399.htm">3399</a>，<a href="4865.htm">4865</a>节）；“他玛”是指代表性教会的内在，如前所述（<a href="4864.htm">4864</a>节）；“儿媳”是指教会的真理（<a href="4843.htm">4843</a>，<a href="4869.htm">4869</a>节）。因此，“说，你的儿媳他玛作了妓女”这句话表示此时的一种觉知，即：若说他们之间存在任何婚姻之物，这是一种虚假。这一切的含义可参看前文（<a href="4864.htm">4864</a>-<a href="4866.htm">4866</a>节），即：犹太民族出于其宗教表象将教会的内在仅仅视为一个妓女，将其讲道和由此而来的生活仅仅视为淫乱，因为那些仅局限于没有内在的外在之人不会以任何其它方式看待教会的内在。他们称虚假为真理，称真理为虚假。原因在于，没有人能唯独凭外在看到某事是假还是真，只能凭内在。必须有一个内在视觉能对外在视觉所看到的事物作出判断；为做出这类判断，内在视觉必须完全处于天堂之光。不过，除非此人拥有对主之信，并且这信引导他阅读圣言。<br />犹太民族局限于没有内在的外在，因而视真理为虚假，视虚假为真理；这一事实从他们的教导明显看出来，即：仇恨敌人是可以的；也可从他们的生活明显看出来，因为他们仇恨所有不属于其宗教表象的人。当以野蛮残忍的方式对待外邦人，也就是说，将他们所宰杀之人的尸体暴露出去，任由野兽或飞鸟吃尽，切割活人，用铁耙和铁斧把他们砍成碎片，或叫他们经过砖窑（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下12.31.htm">12:31</a>）时，他们甚至以为他们正在取悦并事奉耶和华。此外，按照他们的教导，要几乎以同样的方式对待由于某种原因而被宣称为敌人的盟友。由此很清楚地看出，他们的宗教表象中根本没有任何内在之物。如果那时有人告诉他们说，这种行为违背教会的内在，他们就会回答说，这是一个虚假。他们只局限于外在，完全不知道何为内在，并过着一种违背内在的生活；这一事实也可从主在马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.21.htm">5:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.48.htm">48</a>）中的教导明显看出来。</p>

Saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot. That this signifies perception then that it is false that anything conjugial exists between them, is evident from the signification of "saying" 
in the historic parts of the Word, as being perception, of which above (n. 4892); from the signification of "playing the harlot," as being falsity (n. 2466, 2729, 3399, 4865); from the representation 
of Tamar, as being the internal of the representative church, of which also above (n. 4864); and from the signification of "daughter-in-law" as being the truth of the church (n. 4843, 4869). Hence 
by the words "saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot" is signified perception then that it is false that anything conjugial exists between them. How these things stand in the series 
may be seen above (n. 4864-4866), namely, that the Jewish nation from their religiosity perceived the internal of the church simply as a harlot, and its preaching and consequent life simply as whoredom. 
For they who are in the external alone without the internal do not otherwise regard the internal of the church, since they call that false which is true, and that true which is false. The reason is 
that no one can see from the external alone whether a thing be false or true, but only from the internal. There must be an internal sight which shall judge of those things which are of external sight, 
and in order to do this the internal sight must be wholly in the light of heaven; and it is not in the light of heaven unless it is in faith in the Lord, and from this faith reads the Word. [2] That 
the Jewish nation were in the external without the internal, and therefore believed truth to be falsity, and falsity truth, is evident from their teaching that it was allowable to hate an enemy; and 
also from their life in that they hated all who were not of their religiosity. They even believed that they were pleasing and serving Jehovah when they treated the Gentiles with barbarity and cruelty, 
exposing their bodies after they had been slain to be devoured by birds and wild beasts, cutting them in two with saws while alive, lacerating them with harrows and axes of iron, and making them pass 
through the brick-kiln (2 Sam. 12:31). Moreover, it was in accordance with their teachings to treat in almost the same way a companion who for any cause was declared an enemy. Thus it is plainly evident 
that there was nothing internal in their religiosity. If anyone had then said to them that such things are contrary to the internal of the church, they would have replied that this was false. That 
they were merely in externals, were wholly ignorant of what the internal is, and led a life contrary to the internal, is plain also from what the Lord teaches in Matthew, chapter 5, verses 21 to 48. </p>

'Saying, Tamar your daughter-in-law has committed whoredom' means a perception at this point that to say anything of marriage exists between them is a falsity. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' 
in the historical descriptions of the Word as perception, dealt with above in <a href="489.htm">489</a>~; from the meaning of 'committing whoredom' as falsity, dealt with in <a href="2466.htm">2466</a>, <a href="2729.htm">2729</a>, <a href="3399.htm">3399</a>, <a href="4865.htm">4865</a>; from the representation 
of 'Tamar' as the internal aspect of the representative Church, also dealt with above, in <a href="4864.htm">4864</a>; and from the meaning of 'e daughter-in-law' as the truth of the Church, dealt with in <a href="4843.htm">4843</a>, <a href="4869.htm">4869</a>. Consequently 
the words 'saying, Tamar your daughter-in-law has committed whoredom' means a perception at this point that to say anything of marriage exists between them is a falsity. The implications of 
all this may be seen above in <a href="4864.htm">4864</a>-<a href="4866.htm">4866</a>; with its semblance of religion the Jewish nation perceived the internal aspect of the Church to be nothing else than a harlot, and its preaching and life based 
on this to be nothing else than whoredom. For those people who are confined to what is external devoid of anything internal do not look on the internal aspect of the Church in any other way. They give 
the name falsity to that which is true, and the name truth to that which is false. They do so for the reason that being confined to what is external does not enable anyone to see whether a thing is 
false or true; only what is internal makes this possible internal sight is a necessary ability which can make judgements about things seen by external sight; and to make such judgements internal sight 
must be fully in the light of heaven. But it is not in the light of heaven unless the person has faith in the Lord and this faith leads him to read the Word. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that the Jewish nation were 
confined to what was external devoid of anything internal, so that it believed what was true to be falsity, and conversely what was false to be the truth, is quite evident from their teaching that 
one was allowed to hate an enemy and also from their life of hating all who did not belong to their semblance of religion. Indeed it is quite evident from their belief that they pleased and served Jehovah 
when they treated gentile nations in a savage and cruel fashion, that is to say, when they exposed the bodies of those whom they had slaughtered to be devoured by wild animals or birds, cut up those 
who were still alive, hacked them to pieces with iron picks and axes, or made them pass through the brickkiln, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2012:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 12:31</a>. Indeed their teachings asserted that even an ally who for some reason 
had been declared an enemy was to be treated in much the same way. From these considerations it becomes quite clear that nothing internal at all lay within their semblance of religion. If anyone at that 
time had told them that such actions were contrary to the inner spirit of the Church they would have replied that this was a falsity. The fact that they were confined to what was external, having no 
knowledge at all of anything internal and leading lives contrary to what was internal, is also evident from what the Lord teaches in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%205:21-48&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 5:21-48</a>. </p>

`Dicendo, Scortata Tamar nurus tua': quod significet perceptionem tunc quod falsum {1}sit quod aliquod conjugiale intercedat, constat a significatione `dicere' in historicis Verbi quod sit perceptio, 
de qua supra n. 4892; ex significatione `scortari' quod sit falsum, de qua n. 2466, 2729, 3399, 4865; (c)ex repraesentatione `Tamaris' quod sit internum Ecclesiae repraesentativae, de qua etiam 
supra n. 4864; et ex significatione `nurus' quod sit Ecclesiae verum, de qua n. 4843, 4869; inde per illa verba, `dicendo, Scortata Tamar nurus tua,' significatur perceptio tunc quod falsum sit quod 
conjugiale intercedat; quomodo haec se habent in serie, {2}videatur supra n. 4864-4866, quod nempe gens Judaica ex religioso suo non aliter perceperit internum Ecclesiae quam sicut scortum, et 
ejus praedicationem et vitam secundum illam quam sicut scortationem; qui enim in solo externo absque interno sunt, non aliter considerant Ecclesiae internum, vocant enim id falsum quod est verum, et 
id verum quod est falsum; </p>
<p>causa est quia nemo videre potest a solo externo num falsum aut verum sit, sed ab interno; erit visus internus qui judicabit de illis quae sunt visus externi, et visus internus 
ut judicet de illis quae sunt visus {3}interni, omnino erit in luce caeli, et in luce caeli non est nisi sit in fide in Dominum, et ex illa fide legat Verbum. Quod gens Judaica 2 in externo 
absque interno fuerit et ideo crediderit verum esse falsum, (c)ac vicissim, patet manifeste a doctrinali eorum quod liceret inimicum {4}odisse, et quoque a vita quod oderint omnes qui non ex religioso 
eorum fuerunt; immo quod crediderint beneplacuisse et servivisse Jehovae cum immaniter et crudeliter tractarent gentes, nempe corpora eorum, cum trucidati, exponerent feris et avibus devoranda, 
`vivos secarent serris, scinderent ferri tribulis et securibus, transmitterent per fornacem lateritiam', 2 Sam. xii 31; immo etiam secundum doctrinalia eorum fuit, paene similiter tractare socium, qui 
ob aliquam causam declaratus fuit hostis; inde satis constare potest quod nihil interni fuerit in religioso eorum; {5} si quis tunc dixisset illis quod talia contra internum Ecclesiae essent, respondissent 
quod hoc falsum {6}: quod solum in externis fuerint, et prorsus nesciverint quid internum, et vitam egerint contra internum, patet etiam ab illis quae Dominus docet apud Matthaeum (x)v
