<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5555节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5554.</strong>构成身体外在覆盖层的社群有很多，从脸直到脚底都各不相同；因为处处都有不同。我与这些社群有过许多谈话。就他们的属灵生命而言，他们是这种人：他们允许自己被其他人说服相信某事是真理；并且一旦听见取自圣言字义的证据，他们就完全相信它，并严格坚持他们所接受的观念，还根据这种观念开创一种生活，尽管这不是一种邪恶的生活。不具类似性质的灵人很难与他们打交道；因为他们顽固坚持他们业已接受的观念，不肯通过理性思考被引离这些观念。像这样的灵人大多来自地球，因为我们的星球处于外在事物，对内在事物的反应就像皮肤一样。 5555.有些灵人活在肉身时只知道信仰的大体概况，如要爱邻舍，并出于这一基本原则既向义人行善，同样向恶人行善，不对这两类人加以区分；因为他们声称人人都是邻舍。这些灵人活在世上时，允许自己被诡诈、假冒为善的骗子大大迷惑。他们在来世遭遇同样的事；他们也不关心向他们所说的话，因为他们是感官的，对理性概念不感兴趣。这些灵人构成皮肤，不过是没大有感觉的外层部分。我曾与构成头骨皮肤的灵人交谈过。构成皮肤的灵人就像身体各个部位的皮肤一样，也有很大的不同，如头骨不同区域的皮肤：头骨前面的、后面的、太阳穴的；或脸部皮肤，以及胸部、腹部、腰部、脚、手臂、手和手指的皮肤。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5555</b></p><p><b>5555.</b>
There are those who in the life of the body have known nothing but the general things of faith-as that the neighbor ought to be loved-and who from this general principle have done good to the evil and 
to the upright alike without discrimination, saying that everyone is the neighbor. When these lived in the world they suffered themselves to be led much astray by the deceitful, hypocritical, and pretending; 
and the same thing happens to them in the other life; nor do they care what is said to them, for they are sensuous and do not enter into reasons. These also constitute the skin, but the outer 
and less sensitive part. I have spoken with those who constitute the skin of the skull. There is as great a difference in those who constitute the skin, as there is in the skin itself in various places-as 
on different parts of the skull, about the occiput, sinciput, and temples, on the face, and on the chest, abdomen, loins, feet, arms, hands, and fingers. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5555</b></p><p><b>5555.</b>
There are spirits who during their lifetime knew no more than the general outlines of faith, such as the requirement to love their neighbour, and in obedience to this general basic command did good no 
less to the wicked than to the upright, without discriminating between those two kinds of people; for they said that everyone was their neighbour. When spirits like these lived in the world they allowed 
themselves to be led astray greatly by deceitful, hypocritical, and fraudulent persons. Much the same happens to them in the next life, where they do not bother to listen to what anyone else tells 
them because they are ruled by their senses and do not go in for rational ideas. These spirits constitute the skin - the outer part where there is not so much feeling. I have talked to those who constitute 
the skin which covers the skull. These differ considerably, as does the skin on various parts of the body, such as that on different areas of the skull to the back of it, to the front of it, and 
on the temples, or that on the face, and over the chest, abdomen, loins, feet, arms, hands, and fingers. </p>

Qui in vita corporis nihil nisi quam communia fidei sciverant, sicut quod proximus amandus, et ex communi illo principio benefecerant aeque malis ac {1} probis absque discrimine, dixerunt enim quod 
quisque sit proximus; tales cum vixerunt in mundo, se multum seduci passi sunt a dolosis, hypocritis et simulatoribus; similiter fit illis in altera vita, nec curant quid illis dicitur, nam sensuales 
sunt et in rationes non intrant.  Hi {2} quoque constituunt cutem, sed exteriorem minus sensibilem. Locutus cum illis qui cutem cranii constituunt; sed {3} tales sunt cum multa differentia, sicut est 
cutis illa in variis locis, ut in diversis locis cranii, versus occiput, sinciput, tempora, in facie, super thoracem, abdomen, lumbos, pedes, brachia, manus, digitos. @1 quam$ @2 Tales$ @3 constituebant; etiam$ </p>
