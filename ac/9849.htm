<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9849节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9849.</strong>“为以色列人作纪念石”表出于怜悯，永远为了属灵国度。这从以弗得肩带上的“纪念石”和“以色列人”的含义清楚可知：以弗得肩带上的“纪念石”是指出于怜悯对良善和真理的永远保存，（“肩带上的石头”表示对良善和真理的保存，这一点从<a href="9836.htm">9836</a>节的说明清楚看出来；“纪念”当论及主时，表示怜悯，这一点从下文明显看出来）；“以色列人”是指主的属灵国度（参看<a href="9842.htm">9842</a>节）。在圣言中有些地方论到耶和华，也就是主说，祂“纪念”或“不纪念”，以此表示那时凡所发生的事，无论保存还是拯救，都是出于怜悯而行的。这同样适用于说祂看见、听见、知道，或不看、不听、不知道的地方；这些话也表示祂的怜悯，或不怜悯。这些事论及祂是由于祂被比作一个人，还由于表象。因为当一个人转身离开主时，如他作恶时的情形，由于主在他背后，故在他看来，好像主不看他，不垂听或知道他，也不纪念他；而事实上，这一切在于人。正是由于这种表象，所以在圣言中，这些事论到主身上。然而，当一个人转向主时，情况截然不同，如他做正确的事时的情形（参看<a href="9306.htm">9306</a>节所提到的地方）。谁都能知道，想起或纪念不可能论及主，因为在祂里面，过去和未来的事都是永恒的，也就是说，它们从永远到永远都是存在的。<br />“纪念或记念”当被归于主时，表示予以同情，从而出于怜悯保存或拯救，这一点从下列经文明显看出来：<br />耶和华显明了祂的救恩，在列族眼前显出祂的公义。记念祂给以色列家的怜悯和真理。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗98.2.htm">98:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗98.3.htm">3</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华纪念我们在卑微的地步，因祂的怜悯是永远的！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗136.23.htm">136:23</a>）<br /><br />求你不要记念我幼年的罪和我的过犯。耶和华啊，求你按你的怜悯，因你的美善记念我。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗25.7.htm">25:7</a>）<br /><br />为他们记念祂的约，照祂丰盛的怜悯后悔。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗106.45.htm">106:45</a>）<br /><br />祂行了奇事，使人记念；耶和华有恩典，有怜悯。祂赐粮食给敬畏祂的人；祂必永远记念祂的约。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗111.4.htm">111:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗111.5.htm">5</a>）<br /><br />求你不要记念先前的罪孽；愿你的怜悯快迎着我们。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗79.8.htm">79:8</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />神已接纳祂的仆人以色列，为要记念祂的怜悯；向我们列祖施怜悯，记念祂的圣约。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.54.htm">1:54</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.72.htm">72</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />人算什么，你竟记念他？（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗8.4.htm">8:4</a>）<br /><br />耶和华啊，求你用对你百姓的美意记念我。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗106.4.htm">106:4</a>）<br /><br />耶和华向来记念我们，祂还要赐福给我们。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗115.12.htm">115:12</a>）<br />撒母耳记：<br />你若垂看婢女的苦情，记念我，不忘婢女。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上1.11.htm">1:11</a>）<br />这些话是撒母耳的母亲哈拿的祈祷；她生撒母耳的时候，经上说“耶和华记念她”（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上1.19.htm">1:19</a>），也就是垂看她的苦情，向她施怜悯。在其它许多经文（如利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.41.htm">26:41</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.42.htm">42</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.45.htm">45</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.9.htm">10:9</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.25.htm">43:25</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.1.htm">49:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛64.9.htm">64:9</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.34.htm">31:34</a>）中，“记念”具有同样的含义。</p>

To be stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel. That this signifies from mercy forever for the spiritual kingdom, is evident from the signification of "the stones of remembrance upon the shoulders 
of the ephod," as being the preservation of good and truth from mercy forever (that "the stones upon the shoulders" denote the preservation of good and truth, is evident from what was shown above, n. 
9836; and that "remembrance," when said of the Lord, denotes mercy, will be evident from what follows); and from the signification of "the sons of Israel," as being the Lord's spiritual kingdom (see 
n. 9842). It is said of Jehovah in the Word, that is, of the Lord that He "remembers," and that He "does not remember," and by this is signified that it is then done from mercy, whether it is preservation 
or deliverance. In like manner it is said that He "sees," "hears," and "knows," and that He "does not see," "hear," and "know;" by which expressions also is signified having compassion, or not having 
compassion. That it is so said is from the likeness and appearance with man; for when a man turns away from the Lord, as is the case when he does evil, then, because the Lord is at his back, it 
appears to him as if the Lord does not see him, does not hear him, and does not know him, and also does not remember him; when yet this is with the man, and therefore from the appearance it is so said 
in the Word. Very different is it when a man turns toward the Lord, as is the case when he acts well. (See the places cited in n. 9306.) Everyone can know that calling to mind, or remembering, cannot 
be predicated of the Lord, because things past and future are in Him eternal, that is, are present from eternity to eternity. [2] That "remembering," when said of the Lord, denotes to have compassion, 
and thus from mercy to preserve or deliver, is evident from the following passages: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath made known His salvation; His righteousness hath He revealed before the eyes of the nations. He 
hath remembered His mercy and His truth toward the house of Israel (Ps. 98:2, 3).      Jehovah hath remembered us in our humility, for His mercy is forever (Ps. 136:23).      Remember not the sins 
of my youth, and my transgressions; according to Thy mercy remember Thou me, for Thy goodness' sake, O Jehovah (Ps. 25:7).      He remembered for them His covenant, and repented in the multitude of 
His mercies (Ps. 106:45).      He hath made His wonderful works to be remembered; Jehovah is gracious and merciful. He hath given food unto them that fear Him; He hath remembered His covenant forever 
(Ps. 111:4, 5).      Remember not former iniquities; let Thy compassions anticipate us (Ps. 79:8).      God hath accepted his servant Israel, that He might remember His mercy; to do mercy with our 
fathers, and to remember His holy covenant (Luke 1:54, 72).      What is man that Thou dost remember him? (Ps. 8:4).      Remember me, O Jehovah, in the good pleasure of Thy people (Ps. 106:4).    
  Jehovah hath remembered us; He blesseth (Ps. 115:12).      If looking Thou wilt look on the misery of Thine handmaid, and wilt remember me, and not forget Thine handmaid (1 Sam. 1:11); </p>
<p>being the prayer 
of Hannah the mother of Samuel; and when she bare him, it is said that "Jehovah remembered her" (verse 19), that is, looked upon her misery, and performed mercy. In like manner in many other passages, 
as Lev. 26:41-42, 45; Num. 10:9; Isa. 43:25; 49:1; 64:9; Jer. 31:34. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9849</b></p><p><b>9849.</b>
'As stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel' means out of mercy, for evermore for the spiritual kingdom. This is clear from the meaning of 'stones of remembrance' on the shoulders of the ephod as 
the preservation of good and truth out of mercy, for evermore (the fact that the preservation of good and truth is meant by 'stones on the shoulders' is clear from what has been shown in <a href="9836.htm">9836</a>; and the 
fact that mercy is meant by 'remembrance', when attributed to the Lord, will be clear from what follows below); and from the meaning of 'the sons of Israel' as the Lord's spiritual kingdom, dealt with 
above in <a href="9842.htm">9842</a>. There are places in the Word which say of Jehovah, that is, the Lord, that He remembers or does not remember. When either is said of Him the meaning is that whatever takes place then, 
whether preservation or deliverance, is done out of mercy. The same applies to places saying that He sees, hears, or knows, or does not see, hear, or know; His pity or failure to pity are meant there. 
Such things are said of Him on account of His being likened to a human being and on account of what seems to happen. For when a person turns away from the Lord, as is the case when he does anything 
bad, it seems to that person, since the Lord is now behind his back, as though the Lord fails to see him, does not hear or know him, indeed fails to remember him, when in fact the failure is in the 
person. It is because of this appearance therefore that in the Word such things are said of the Lord. The situation is completely different however when a person turns towards the Lord, as is the case 
when he does what is right, see the places referred to in <a href="9306.htm">9306</a>. Anyone may recognize that the Lord cannot really be said to remember or call to mind, because in Him things that are past and those that 
are future are eternal, that is, they are ever present from eternity to eternity.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that 'remembering', when attributed to the Lord, means having compassion, and so preserving or delivering 
out of mercy, is clear from the following places: In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah has made known His salvation, before the eyes of the nations He has revealed His righteousness. He has remembered His mercy

<p>In 
Luke,  </p>
<blockquote>
God has accepted His servant Israel, so that He remembered His mercy ... to perform mercy to our fathers and to remember His holy covenant. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%201:54,%2072&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 1:54, 72</a>.

<p>In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
What is man

<p>In the same author,  </p>

<p>In the first Book of Samuel,  </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>These words begin the 
vow made by Hannah, Samuel's mother; and verse 19 says that when she bore him Jehovah remembered her, that is, He looked on her misery and had mercy on her. 'Remember' has a similar meaning in many 
other places, such as <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2026:41,%2042,%2045&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 26:41, 42, 45</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2010:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 10:9</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2043:25;%2049:1;%2064:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 43:25; 49:1; 64:9</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31:34</a>.

`Lapides recordationis filiis Israelis': quod significet ex misericordia in perpetuum regno spirituali, constat ex significatione `lapidum recordationis super umeris ephodi' quod sint conservatio boni 
et veri ex misericordia in perpetuum; quod `lapides {1} super umeris' sint conservatio boni et veri, constat ex illis quae n. 9836 ostensa sunt, et quod `recordatio' cum de Domino, sit misericordia 
{2}, constabit ex sequentibus; et ex significatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint regnum spirituale Domini, de qua supra n. 9842. Dicitur in Verbo de Jehovah, hoc est, Domino, quod recordetur, et quod 
non recordetur, et per id significatur {3}quod tunc fit ex misericordia, sive (t)sit conservatio sive liberatio; similiter ac quod videat, audiat, cognoscat, et quod non videat, non audiat, et non cognoscat, 
per quae etiam miserationes et non miserationes significantur quod ita dicatur, est ex similitudine cum homine, et ex apparentia; cum enim homo avertit se a Domino, quod fit cum {4}malum facit, 
tunc, quia Dominus ei a tergo est, apparet ei sicut Dominus non videat illum, non audiat et cognoscat illum, nec recordetur ejus, cum tamen id apud hominem est, inde ex apparentia ita dicitur in Verbo; 
vicissim autem cum homo vertit se ad Dominum, quod fit cum bene facit, videantur loca citata n. 9306; quisque scire potest quod de Domino non praedicari possit recordari seu meminisse, quoniam praeterita 
et futura in Ipso sunt aeterna, hoc est, praesentia ab aeterno in aeternum. 	[2] Quod `recordari' cum de Domino, sit misereri, ac ita conservare aut liberare ex misericordia, constat a sequentibus 
his locis: apud Davidem, 	(x)Notam fecit Jehovah salutem Suam, coram oculis gentium  revelavit justitiam Suam, recordatus misericordiae Suae et veritatis Suae domui Israelis, Ps. xcviii 2 (,3): </p>
<p>apud 
eundem, 	Jehovah in humilitate nostra recordatus est nostri, quia in aeternum misericordia Ipsius, Ps. cxxxvi 23: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Peccatorum pueritiae meae et praevaricationum mearum ne recorderis, 
juxta misericordiam Tuam recorderis mei Tu, propter bonitatem Tuam, Jehovah, Ps. xxv 7: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Recordatus est illis foederis Sui, et paenituit Ipsum ex multitudine misericordiarum Ipsius, 
Ps. cvi 45: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Recordationem fecit mirabilibus Suis, gratiosus et misericors Jehovah; cibum dedit timentibus Ipsum, recordatus in aeternum foederis Sui, Ps. cxi 4, 5: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Ne 
recorderis iniquitatum priorum; praeveniant miserationes Tuae, Ps. lxxix 8: </p>
<p>[3] apud Lucam, 	Deus acceptavit Israelem servum Suum, ita ut recordaretur misericordiae Suae, ad faciendum misericordiam 
cum patribus nostris, et ad recordandum foederis sancti Sui, i 54, 72: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, 	Quid homo quod recorderis ejus? Ps. viii 5 (A.V. 4): </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Recordare mei, Jehovah, in beneplacito 
populi Tui, Ps. cvi 4: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Jehovah recordatus est nostri, benedicit, Ps. cxv 12: </p>
<p>in Libro 1 Samuelis, 	Si respiciendo respexeris miseriam ancillae Tuae, et recordatus fueris mei, nec oblitus

<p>votum Channae matris Samuelis, quem cum peperit, dicitur quod Jehovah recordatus sit ejus, vers. 19, hoc est, respexerit ad miseriam ejus, et praestiterit misericordiam; 
similiter pluries alibi, ut Lev. xxvi 41, 42, 45; Num. x 9; Esai xliii 25, xlix 1, lxiv 8 (A.V. 9); Jer. xxxi 34. @1 illi$ @2 i in perpetuum$ @3 id quod$ @4 mala$ </p>
