<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第697节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>697．每个人身边至少有两个恶灵和两名天使。他通过恶灵与地狱相联，通过天使与天堂相联。若非与这二者相联，人片刻不能存活。因此，每个人都在某个地狱社群，尽管他没有意识到这一点。但他们的折磨不会传给他，因为他处在为永生做准备的状态。在来生（灵界），人一直所在的社群有时会显示给他，因为他会返回去，从而回到他在世时的生活中。他由此要么趋向地狱，要么被举升天堂。因此，人若不生活在仁爱的良善中，且不让主引领自己，就会成为地狱的一员，死后也会变成一个魔鬼。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]697.</strong> We each have at least two evil spirits and two angels present with us. Through the evil spirits we have contact with hell, and through the angels we have contact with heaven. If we were not in touch with both, we could not possibly survive for a minute. So every one of us, although completely unaware of the fact, associates with some group of hellish spirits; but their torment is not transmitted to us, because we are undergoing preparation for eternal life. In the other world, we are sometimes shown the community we had been part of, since we go back to it and therefore to the life we had lived on earth. From there we either head toward hell or go up to heaven.<br />People who do not lead good, charitable lives or allow the Lord to guide them are part of the hellish crowd. After death they become devils themselves. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 697</b></p><p><b>697.</b>
There are with every man at least two evil spirits and two angels. Through the evil spirits the man has communication with hell; and through the angels, with heaven. Without communication with both no 
man can live a moment. Thus every man is in some society of infernals, although he is unaware of it. But their torments are not communicated to him, because he is in a state of preparation for eternal 
life. The society in which a man has been is sometimes shown him in the other life; for he returns to it, and thereby into the life that he had in the world; and from thence he either tends toward 
hell, or is raised up toward heaven. Thus a man who does not live in the good of charity, and does not suffer himself to be led by the Lord, is one of the infernals, and after death also becomes a devil. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 697</b></p><p><b>697.</b>
At least two evil spirits and two angels are present with every man. Through the evil spirits a person is in communication with hell, and through the angels with heaven. Without communication in both 
directions no one can survive for the smallest fraction of time. Everybody is accordingly in contact with some community of those in hell, though he is not directly conscious of it. Their torments however 
cannot be transmitted to him because he is still in the process of being prepared for eternal life. That community to which he has been allied is sometimes shown to him in the next life, for he 
goes back to it and so to the life which he led in the world. And from this point he either makes his way towards hell or is raised up into heaven. So anyone who does not lead a life consisting of good 
that stems from charity and who does not allow himself to be led by the Lord is one of those who belong in hell, and after death he also becomes a devil. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 697</b>
</p><b>697.</b>
Apud unumquemvis hominem sunt ad minimum duo spiritus mali et duo angeli; homo per spiritus malos communicationem habet cum inferno, et per angelos cum caelo; absque communicatione utrinque homo nequaquam 
minutum temporis vivere potest; ita unusquisque homo in aliqua societate infernalium est, quod prorsus nescit; sed cruciatus eorum ei non communicantur, quia in praeparatione ad vitam aeternam 
est; societas illa, in qua fuit, ei in altera vita quandoque ostenditur, nam ad illam redit et sic in vitam quam habuit in mundo, et inde vel ad infernum tendit, vel ad caelum elevatur: ita homo qui non 
in bono charitatis vivit et se non duci a Domino patitur, unus infernalium est et post mortem fit quoque diabolus. </p>
