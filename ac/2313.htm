<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2313节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2313.</strong>这教会的第一个状态是：他们处于仁之善，承认主，通过祂巩固在良善中（1-3节）；并得救（12节）。第二个状态是：对他们来说，邪恶开始反对良善，但他们被主从罪恶中强行引退，并被保守在良善中（14-16节）。描述了他们的软弱（17节）；他们得救了（19节）。第三个状态：他们不再通过对良善的情感，而是通过对真理的情感思考和行事（18-20节）；并且他们得救了（23节）。第四个状态是：对真理的情感消失了，这就是罗得的妻子变成一根盐柱所表示的（26节）。第五个状态：不纯洁的良善，或虚假的良善取而代之，这就是住在山洞中的罗得所表示的（30节）。第六个状态：这善被玷污和歪曲得更厉害（31-33节）；真理同样如此（34-35节）。教会的某种假象由此孕育而生，其所谓的良善就是“摩押”，其所谓的真理就是“亚扪人”（36-38节）。</p>

The First State of that church: that they are in the good of charity and acknowledge the Lord, and that from Him they are confirmed in good (verses 1-3); and are saved (verse 12). The Second State: that 
with them evils begin to act against goods, but they are powerfully withheld from evils and kept in goods by the Lord (verses 14-16). Their weakness is described (verse 17); that they are saved (verse 
19). The Third State: that they no longer think and act from the affection of good, but from the affection of truth (verses 18-20); and that they are saved (verse 23). The Fourth State: that the 
affection of truth perishes, which is Lot's wife becoming a pillar of salt (verse 26). The Fifth State: that an impure good, or a good of falsity, succeeds, which is Lot in the cave of the mountain (verse 
30). The Sixth State: that even this good is still more adulterated and falsified (verses 31-33); and the truth likewise (verses 34-35). That therefrom there is conceived and born a certain semblance 
of a church whose good, so called, is "Moab," and whose truth, also so called, is the "son of Ammon" (verses 36-38). </p>

The first state of that Church: people have the good of charity and acknowledge the Lord; and from Him they are strengthened in good, verses 1-3, and are saved, verse 12. The second state: with those 
people evils start to react against goods, but they are powerfully withheld from evils and maintained in goods by the Lord, verses 14-16; their helplessness is described, verse 18; they are saved, verse 19. The third state: they no longer think and act from an affection for good but from an affection for truth, verses 18-20; and they are saved, verse 23. The fourth state: the affection for truth 
perishes, meant by Lot's wife becoming a pillar of salt, verse 26. The fifth state: impure good, or good enveloped in falsity, supersedes, meant by Lot in the mountain-cave, verse 30. The sixth state: 
even this good is adulterated and falsified further still, verses 31-33, and truth equally so, verses 34, 35. From this some semblance of a Church is conceived and born, whose good, so-called, is Moab, 
and whose truth, also so-called, is the son of Ammon, verses 36-38. </p>

Primus Status Ecclesiae illius, quod in bono charitatis sint et Dominum agnoscant; et quod ab Ipso in bono confirmentur, vers. 1-3, et salventur, vers. 12 Secundus Status, quod apud eos mala incipiant 
agere contra bona, at quod detineantur potenter a malis et teneantur in bonis, a Domino, vers. 14-16: imbecillitas eorum describitur, vers. (x)18: quod salventur, vers. 19: Tertius Status, quod non 
amplius ex affectione boni, sed ex affectione veri, cogitent et agant, vers. 18-20; et quod salventur, vers. 23: Quartus Status, quod affectio veri pereat, quod est `uxor Loti facta statua salis,' vers. 
26: Quintus Status, quod bonum impurum seu bonam falsi succedat, quod est `Lot in spelunca montis,' vers. 30: Sextus Status, quod etiam hoc bonum adhuc magis adulteretur et falsificetur, vers. 31-33 
pariter verum, vers. 34, 35: quod inde concipiatur et nascatur quoddam instar Ecclesiae, cujus bonum ita vocatum est `Moab,' et cujus verum etiam ita vocatum est `filius Ammonis' [vers. 36-38]. </p>
