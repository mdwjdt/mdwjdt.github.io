<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1242节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1242.</strong>“希伯的两个儿子”表两种敬拜，即内在敬拜和外在敬拜，这两个儿子叫“法勒”和“约坍”，“法勒”是指该教会的内在敬拜，“约坍”是指它的外在敬拜。这主要从以下事实清楚看出来，即“希伯和希伯来民族”的内义就表这第二代古教会，还因为每个教会都有一个内在和一个外在，因为没有内在，它就不会、也不可能称之为一个教会，不过是偶像崇拜。由于“儿子”在此指向教会，故显而易见，一个儿子表教会的内在，另一个则表外在。类似的双重性经常出现在圣言的各个地方，如之前拉麦的妻子亚大和洗拉（参看<a href="409.htm">409</a>节），后来的利亚和拉结，雅各（Jacob）和以色列等等所表示的。本章论述的是约坍的后代，下一章论述的是法勒的后代。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1242.</strong> Eber's two sons symbolize two kinds of worship, inward and outward, and the two sons were called Peleg and Joktan. Peleg symbolizes the inward devotions of that church, while Joktan symbolizes its outward devotions. The main evidence for this is as follows. In an inner sense Eber and the nation he founded symbolize this second ancient church. Every church has an inner and an outer dimension, since a church lacking an inner plane is not a church and cannot be called a church but a form of idolatry. It is evident, then, since different aspects of the church are what the sons portray, that one of them symbolizes the church's inner dimension and the other the outer. The same thing happens in many other places throughout the Word. Adah and Zillah, Lamech's wives (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1242/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_409" target=_top>409</a>), provide one earlier example. Leah and Rachel provide another, and Jacob and Israel (who will be discussed later), another.{*1} There are yet others too.<br />The present chapter deals with Joktan's descendants; the next, with Peleg's.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Section <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1242/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_409" target=_top>409</a> also mentions Leah's and Rachel's roles in representing the outer and inner churches. Section 422 does too, and adds Jacob and Israel. As indicated in note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1242/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_422" target=_top>422</a>, the meaning of Leah and Rachel is explored further in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1242/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3817" target=_top>3817-3821</a> and many of the surrounding passages, and the meaning of Jacob and Israel is addressed in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1242/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4292" target=_top>4292</a>.

That by the two sons of Eber, who were named Peleg and Joktan, the two kinds of worship of that church, internal and external, are signified-by Peleg the internal worship and by Joktan the external worship-is 
evident especially from this, that in the internal sense this second Ancient Church is signified by Eber and the Hebrew nation, and that in every church there is an internal and an external. 
For without the internal it is not and cannot be called a church, but an idolatry. Therefore, "sons" being here predicated of the church, it is evident that by one son the internal of the church is signified, 
and by the other the external; as in various other places in the Word; and as is signified by Adah and Zillah, the two wives of Lamech (see n. 409); by Leah and Rachel; by Jacob and Israel, 
of whom hereafter; and by others. The posterity of Joktan is treated of in this chapter; that of Peleg in the following chapter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1242</b></p><p><b>1242.</b>
'Eber's two sons' means the two aspects of worship - internal and external - and these two sons were called Peleg and Joktan, 'Peleg' meaning the internal worship of that Church, and 'Joktan' the external 
worship of that Church. This is clear chiefly from the fact that 'Eber and the Hebrew nation' means in the internal sense this second Ancient Church, and also because every Church has an internal 
and an external, for without the internal it neither is nor can be called a Church, but idolatry. Since 'sons' has reference to aspects of the Church it is clear that one son means the internal aspect 
of the Church, the other the external. A similar duality frequently occurs elsewhere in the Word, for example, that meant previously by Lamech's wives, Adah and Zillah, <a href="409.htm">409</a>, and that meant later on 
by Leah and Rachel, and by Jacob and Israel, and others like these. The descendants of Joktan are dealt with in this chapter, those of Peleg in the next. </p>

</p><b>1242.</b>
Quod per 'binos filios Eberi' significentur bini cultus, nempe internus et externus, qui bini filii dicti fuerunt Peleg et Joktan, et quod per 'Peleg' significetur istius Ecclesiae cultus internus et 
per 'Joktan' istius Ecclesiae cultus externus, constat imprimis ex eo quod per 'Eberum et gentem Eberi' significetur in sensu interno Ecclesia haec altera Antiqua, et quia in unaquavis Ecclesia est 
internum et externum, nam absque interno non est nec dici potest Ecclesia, sed idololatria; ideo quia sunt illa quae sunt Ecclesiae, de quibus praedicantur 'filii,' constat quod per unum filiorum significetur 
internum Ecclesiae et per alterum externum, sicut passim in Verbo alibi, ut prius per Adam et Zillam, uxores Lamechi, n. 409, per Leam et Rachelem, per Jacobum et Israelem, de quibus in sequentibus; 
similiter per alios.  De Joktanis posteritate agitur in hoc capite, de Pelegi in sequente. </p>
