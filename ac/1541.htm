<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1541节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1541.</strong>创世记13:1.亚伯兰从埃及上来，他和他的妻子，并一切所有的，与罗得都往南地去。<br />就内义而言，这些细节，以及本章接下来的细节均代表主；它们继续论述主孩童时的生命。“亚伯兰从埃及上来”表远离那些离开主的记忆知识。“亚伯兰”的内义是指主，这时，主还是个孩子；和前面一样，“埃及”在此是指知识。“他和他的妻子”表当时主所具有的属天真理。“并一切所有的”表属于属天之物的一切。“与罗得”表感官知觉的力量。“都往南地去”表进入属天之光。</p><br />

In an inner sense, Abram is the Lord 钬?here, the Lord while still a youth; Egypt is factual knowledge here as before [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1541/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164" target=_top>1164-1165</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1541/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1462" target=_top>1462</a>]. 'He and his wife' symbolizes heavenly truth that the Lord then possessed. 'And everything he had' symbolizes everything connected with heavenly attributes. 'And Lot with him' symbolizes the senses. 'Toward the south' means into heavenly light. </p>

Verse l. And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, toward the south. In the internal sense, the things here stated, and those which follow in this chapter, 
also represent the Lord; there being a continuation of His life from childhood. "Abram went up out of Egypt," signifies from memory-knowledges, which left the Lord. In the internal sense, "Abram" is 
the Lord, here the Lord when still a child; "Egypt," here as before, is memory-knowledge; "he and his wife," signifies the celestial truths that were then with the Lord; "and all that he had" signifies 
all things that were of the celestial "things; "and Lot with him" signifies what is sensuous; "toward the south," signifies into celestial light. </p>

Verse I And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife, and everything he had, and Lot with him, towards the south. </p>
<p>These details and those that follow in this chapter also in the internal sense 
represent the Lord; they continue the subject of His life from childhood. 'Abram went up out of Egypt' means away from the facts which went away from the Lord, 'Abram' in the internal sense being the 
Lord, here when still a boy; 'Egypt' here, as previously, being knowledge. 'He and his wife' means celestial truths which at that time resided with the Lord. 'And everything he had' means everything belonging 
to celestial things. 'And Lot with him' means the power of sensory perception. 'Towards the south' means into celestial light. </p>

</p><b>1541.</b>
Et ascendit Abram ex Aegypto, ipse et uxor illius, et omne quod illi, et Lot cum illo, versus meridiem. Haec et sequentia hujus capitis in sensu interno etiam repraesentant Dominum, estque continuatio 
Ipsius vitae a pueritia. 'Ascendit Abram ex Aegypto' significat quod a scientificis quae Dominum reliquerunt; 'Abram' in sensu interno est Dominus, hic cum adhuc puer; 'Aegyptus' hic ut prius, scientia: 
'ipse et uxor illius' significat caelestia vera quae tunc apud Dominum: 'et omne quod illi' significat omnia quae caelestium essent: 'et Lot cum illo' significat sensuale: 'versus meridiem' significat 
in lucem caelestem. </p>
