<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8944节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8944.</strong>世人以为，人单凭自然之光，因而无需启示就能认识属于宗教的大多数事物，如：相信有一位神，祂要受到敬拜，以及要被热爱，另外人死后还会活着，以及其它依赖于这些的许多事。然而，这些事都是自我聪明的产物。我通过大量经历被指教，若没有启示，人凭自己对神性事物，对属于属天、属灵生命的事物一无所知。因为人生在爱自己爱世界的邪恶中，这些邪恶具有这样的性质：它们封闭来自天堂的流注，打开来自地狱的流注。因此，它们将一个人弄瞎，使他倾向于否认有一个神性，有一个天堂和一个地狱，还有一个死后的生命。这一点从世上有学问的人那里非常明显地看出来，他们凭借知识使自己的自然之光高于其他人的光。因为众所周知，这些人比其他人更否认神性，承认自然，而不是神性；而且，当他们从心里，而不从教义说话时，就否认死后的生命，还否认天堂和地狱，进而否认信的一切，他们将信的一切称为对普遍百姓的束缚。由此明显可知，没有启示的自然之光是何性质。我还被指示，在来世，许多曾写过自然神学，凭他们的自然之光巧妙证实了其教会的教义之人，比任何人都更从心里否认这些事，还否认圣言本身，他们试图彻底摧毁圣言。因为在来世，是人们的心在说话。我又被指示，这些人不能接受来自天堂的任何流注，只能接受来自地狱的流注。这一切清楚表明，没有启示的自然之光是何性质，因而由人自己的聪明或说自我聪明所产生的东西是何性质。<br />但有两种现象可能会心智在这个问题上产生怀疑。第一，古时的外邦人仍知道有一位神，祂当受敬拜，一个人就灵魂而言，是不朽的；第二，如今许多民族也知道这些事，它们当中并没有任何启示。不过，就古人而言，他们并不是从自己的自然之光，而是从启示知道这些事的，这启示从教会甚至传到他们那里。因为主的教会自上古时代起就一直在迦南地（参看<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4454.htm">4454</a>，<a href="4516.htm">4516</a>，<a href="4517.htm">4517</a>，<a href="5136.htm">5136</a>，<a href="6516.htm">6516</a>节）。诸如属于敬拜神的那类事物从这个源头传至周围的各个民族，同样传至邻近的希腊人，又从希腊人传至意大利人或罗马人。所有这些民族，包括希腊人和罗马人，都是从教会获得关于至高无上的神和灵魂不朽的知识，这些也是他们的学者所写的。<br />至于如今那些也知道一位神的存在和死后生命的民族，这些民族也不是从自己的自然之光，而是从自古时传给他们的宗教信仰而拥有这种知识的，他们的宗教信仰便建立在诸如以各种方式从拥有启示的教会那里传来的那类事物之上。这一切是按照主的圣治或天命发生的。此外，他们当中那些出于其宗教信仰承认有一位高于一切的神，并出于其宗教信仰去做仁爱要求他们为自己的邻舍所做的事之人，当在来世接受教导时，就会接受信之真理并得救（参看<a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>节）。</p>

It is believed in the world that a man is able to know from the light of nature, thus without revelation, many things that belong to religion; as that there is a God, that He is to be worshipped, and 
also that He is to be loved, likewise that man will live after death, and many other things that depend upon these; and yet these things being such as are from self-intelligence. But I have been instructed 
by much experience that of himself, and without revelation, man knows nothing whatever about Divine things, and about the things that belong to heavenly and spiritual life. For man is born into 
the evils of the love of self and of the world, which are of such a nature that they shut out the influx from the heavens, and open influx from the hells; thus such as make man blind, and incline him 
to deny that there is a Divine, that there is a heaven and a hell, and that there is a life after death. This is very manifest from the learned in the world, who by means of knowledges have carried the 
light of their nature above the light of others; for it is known that these deny the Divine, and acknowledge nature in place of the Divine, more than others; and also that when they speak from the 
heart, and not from doctrine, they deny the life after death, likewise heaven and hell, consequently all things of faith, which they call bonds for the common people. From this it is plain what is the 
quality of the light of nature without revelation. It has also been shown that many who have written upon natural theology, and from the light of their nature have skillfully confirmed those things which 
belonged to the doctrine of their church, in the other life at heart deny these same things more than others do; and also deny the Word itself, which they attempt utterly to destroy; for in the other 
life hearts speak. It has also been shown that the same can receive nothing of influx out of heaven, but only from the hells. Hence it was plain what is the quality of the light of nature without 
revelation; consequently what is the quality of that which comes from man's own intelligence. [2] But two considerations have arisen which bring the mind into doubt upon this subject: first, that the 
ancients who were Gentiles nevertheless knew that there is a Divine, that this is to be worshiped, and that man as to the soul is immortal; second, that these things are known also to many nations at 
this day, with whom there is no revelation. But as regards the ancients, they did not know these things from the light of their own nature, but from revelation, which had spread from the church even 
unto them; for the Lord's church had been in the land of Canaan from the most ancient times (see n. 3686, 4447, 4454, 4516, 4517, 5136, 6516). From this source such things as pertained to Divine worship 
spread to the nations round about, and likewise to the neighboring Greeks, and from these to the Italians or Romans. From this source both Greeks and Romans had knowledges about the Supreme Deity, 
and the immortality of the soul, of which their learned men wrote. [3] As regards the nations at this day who also know that there is a Divine, and that there is a life after death, these have not had 
this knowledge from the light of their own nature, but from a religiosity derived by them from ancient times, which had been founded on such things as had spread in various ways from the church, which 
had revelation. This was of the Lord's Divine Providence. Moreover, those of them who from their religiosity acknowledge a Divine over all things, and from their religiosity perform the duties of 
charity to their neighbor, when instructed in the other life receive the truths of faith, and are saved (see n. 2589-2604). </p>

In the world it is thought that the human being can recognize from the light of natural evidence alone, that is, without revelation, most of what religion involves, such as the beliefs that there is 
a God, that He is to be worshipped, and also that He is to be loved, and in addition that a person will be alive after death. and many other beliefs dependent on these. However, those beliefs are the 
products of self-intelligence. Much experience has taught me that of himself a person knows nothing whatever about Divine realities, or about things belonging to celestial and spiritual life; without 
revelation he knows nothing about them. For a person is born into the evils of self-love and love of the world, and the nature of these is such that they seal off influx from the heavens and let through 
influx from the hells. This being so, they blind a person and place him in a negative frame of mind about the reality of the Divine, of heaven and hell, and of life after death. This is plainly evident 
from the learned people of the world, who through study of different branches of knowledge have developed the inferior light of this natural evidence of theirs to a higher degree than others. As 
is well known, these more than others deny the Divine, acknowledging natural forces instead. Also, when they speak from what is in their heart and not just from doctrine they deny life after death, also 
heaven and hell, consequently all things that are matters of faith, which they call bonds for the common people. This makes plain what light received from natural evidence without revelation is like. 
I have also been shown that in the next life many of those who have written books about natural theology, and from the inferior light of their natural evidence have skillfully substantiated the teachings 
of their Church, deny those same things at heart more than any others, and also deny the Word itself, which they try to destroy completely. For in the next life people's hearts speak. I have also 
been shown that those same people are unable to receive anything of the influx from heaven, only that from the hells. All this makes plain what light received from natural evidence, without revelation, 
is like, and therefore what anything that is a product of self- intelligence is like. </p>

 But there are two phenomena that might have placed the mind in doubt so far as this matter is concerned. 
The first is that people in ancient times who were gentiles nevertheless knew that there is a God, that He is to be worshipped, and that a person as to his soul is immortal. The second is that those 
things are also known by a large number of nations at the present day among whom no revelation exists. But in the case of the ancients, they did not know those things from the inferior light they received 
from natural evidence but from revelation that spread from the Church even to them. For the Lord's Church had existed since most ancient times in the land of Canaan, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4454.htm">4454</a>, <a href="4516.htm">4516</a>, <a href="4517.htm">4517</a>, <a href="5136.htm">5136</a>, <a href="6516.htm">6516</a>. From there such things as belonged to the worship of God spread to the nations round about and also to the neighbouring Greeks, and from the Greeks to the Italians or Romans. From the Church 
all these nations received the things they knew about a supreme deity, and about the immortality of the soul, which their learned men wrote about. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards the nations at the present day 
who also know of God's existence and of life after death, they have not come to possess that knowledge from the inferior light they receive from natural evidence. They possess it from their religion 
which has come down to them from ancient times and which was founded on such things as had spread in various ways from the Church, where revelation existed. This happened in the Lord's Divine Providence. 
Furthermore those among them who from their religion acknowledge God above all things, and from their religion do what charity requires them to do for their neighbour, on receiving instruction in 
the next life accept the truths of faith and are saved, <a href="258.htm">258</a>- <a href="2604.htm">2604</a>. </p>

Creditur in mundo quod homo ex naturae lumine, ita absque revelatione, scire possit plura quae religionis sunt, sicut quod Deus sit, quod Ille colendus, et quoque quod amandus, tum quod homo victurus 
sit post mortem, et plura alia quae ab illis pendent, et tamen ea sunt quae ex propria intelligentia; sed instructus sum per multam experientiam quod homo ex se prorsus nihil sciat de Divinis, et de 
illis quae vitae caelestis ac spiritualis sunt, absque revelatione; homo enim nascitur in mala amoris sui et mundi, quae sunt talia quae praecludunt influxum e caelis et aperiunt influxum ab infernis, 
ita quae occaecant hominem et ponunt in negativo quod Divinum sit, quod caelum et infernum, quodque vita post mortem; hoc patet manifeste ex eruditis orbis qui lumen suae naturae per scientias evexerunt 
supra lumen aliorum; quod hi prae aliis negent Divinum et pro Divino agnoscant naturam, notum est, et quoque quando ex corde et non ex doctrina loquuntur, quod negent vitam post mortem, tum caelum 
et infernum, consequenter omnia quae fidei sunt, quae vocant vincula pro vulgo; inde patet quale est lumen naturae absque revelatione; ostensum quoque est quod plures qui Theologiam Naturalem scripserunt, 
et ex lumine suae naturae dextre confirmaverunt illa quae doctrinae Ecclesiae suae fuerunt, in altera vita prae reliquis corde eadem negent, et quoque ipsum Verbum, quod prorsus destruere conantur, 
nam in altera vita corda loquuntur; ostensum quoque est quod iidem nihil influxus e caelo possint recipere sed solum ab infernis; inde patuit quale lumen naturae est absque revelatione, proinde quale 
id quod ex propria intelligentia. 	2 Sed duo obvenerunt quae de ea re mentem in dubio ponebant; primum, quod antiqui qui gentiles, usque noverint quod Divinum sit, quod Hoc colendum, quodque homo 
quoad animam immortalis sit; alterum, quod etiam illa sciant plures gentes hodie apud quas nulla revelatio; sed quod antiquos concernit, illi non ex lumine suae naturae id sciverunt sed ex revelatione 
quae usque ad illos ab Ecclesia emanavit; Ecclesia enim Domini ab antiquissimis temporibus fuerat in terra Canaane, n. 3686, 4447, 4454, 4516, 4517, 5136, 6516; inde emanaverunt talia quae cultus Divini 
erant ad gentes circumcirca, et quoque ad Graecos vicinos, et ab his ad Italos seu Romanos; inde his et illis cognitiones de summo numine, et de immortalitate animae, de quibus eruditi illorum scripserunt. 	3 
Quod attinet gentes hodie quae etiam sciunt quod Divinum sit et quod vita post mortem, id non habuerunt ex lumine naturae suae sed ex religioso quod ab antiquis temporibus traxerunt, quod 
fundatum est super talibus quae per varias vias emanaverunt ab Ecclesia, ubi revelatio; hoc ex Divina Domini Providentia fuit; et quoque qui illorum ex religioso suo agnoscunt Divinum super omnia 
et ex religioso suo praestant charitatis officia proximo, quod in altera vita, cum instruuntur, recipiant vera fidei, et salventur, n. 2589-2604. </p>
