<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3356.</strong>“震动”或“移动”表状态改变的原因在于，震动发生在时空中，而来世没有时空的概念，取而代之的是状态的概念。诚然，在来世，一切事物看似在空间中，并且仿佛按照时间顺序相继出现；但时空本身是状态的改变，因为那里的时空是状态的产物。这一点对所有灵人，甚至恶灵来说是众所周知的。恶灵会通过改变状态而诱导别人，使他们看似在别的地方，而事实上他们并不在那里。世人从以下事实也能知道这一点，即：人越处于情感和衍生喜乐的状态，或越处于思维和随之退离肉体的状态，就越在时间之外。因为当这样的状态持续时，他觉得许多小时几乎如同一个小时。这是因为属于他的内在人，即他灵的状态与就对应于外在人中的空间和时间。因此，作为时空中连续事件的“震动”或“移动”在内义上就表示状态的改变。</p>

The reason a "quaking" or "motion" denotes a change of state, is that it takes place in space and in time; and in the other life there is no idea of space and of time; but in their stead there is state. 
It is indeed true that in the other life all things appear as in space, and follow one another as if in time; but in themselves the space and time are changes of state, for they come from this source. 
This is perfectly well known to every spirit, even to the wicked, who by changes of state induced on others cause them to appear in another place, when yet they are not there. Men may know the same 
from the fact that insofar as a man is in a state of the affections and of the derivative joy; and insofar as he is in a state of the thoughts and of a consequent absence from the body, so far he is 
not in time; for many hours then appear to him scarcely as one; and this because his internal man or spirit has states to which the spaces and times in the external man correspond. "Motion," therefore, 
being a successive progression in space and time, is in the internal sense a change of state.            GENESIS 26      1. And there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine that was 
in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.      2. And Jehovah appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land of which I tell 
thee.      3. Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will set up the oath which I sware unto Abraham 
thy father.      4. And I will cause thy seed to be multiplied as the stars of the heavens, and I will give unto thy seed all these lands; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.  
    5. Because that Abraham hearkened to My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.      6. And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.      7. And the men of the place asked him concerning 
his woman; and he said, She is my sister; for he feared to say, She is my woman; lest the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was good to look upon.      8. And it came 
to pass, because the days were there prolonged to him, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out through a window, and saw, and behold Isaac was laughing with Rebekah his woman.      9. And 
Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Surely behold she is thy woman, and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.      10. And Abimelech said, What 
is this thou hast done unto us, in that one of the people might lightly have lain with thy woman, and thou wouldst have brought guilt upon us?      11. And Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, 
He that toucheth this man and his woman, dying he shall die.      12. And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in that year a hundred measures, and Jehovah blessed him.      13. And the man increased, 
and went on going and increasing until he became exceeding great.      14. And he had acquisition of flock, and acquisition of herd, and much service; and the Philistines envied him.      15. And 
all the wells that his father's servants digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped them up, and filled them with dust.      16. And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go away from us; 
for thou art much mightier than we.      17. And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.      18. And Isaac returned, and digged again the wells of waters which 
they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; and the Philistines stopped them up after the death of Abraham; and he called their names after the names which his father called them.      19. 
And the servants of Isaac digged in the valley, and found there a well of living waters.      20. And the shepherds of Gerar strove with Isaac's shepherds, saying, The waters are ours; and he called 
the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.      21. And they digged another well, and they strove over that also, and he called the name of it Sitnah.      22. And he removed from thence, 
and digged another well, and for this they strove not, and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now Jehovah hath made us to be enlarged, and we shall be fruitful in the land.   
   23. And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.      24. And Jehovah appeared to him in that night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father; fear not, for I am with thee, and I will bless thee, 
and will multiply thy seed, for the sake of Abraham My servant.      25. And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah, and pitched his tent there, and there the servants of Isaac 
digged out a well.      26. And Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his companion, and Phicol the captain of his army.      27. And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, 
and ye have hated me, and have sent me away from you.      28. And they said, Seeing we have seen that Jehovah was with thee; and we said, Now let there be an oath between us, between us and thee, and 
let us cut out a covenant with thee.      29. If thou shalt do evil to us, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace; thou art now 
the blessed of Jehovah.      30. And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.      31. And they rose early in the morning, and sware a man to his brother; and Isaac sent them away, and they 
departed from him in peace.      32. And it came to pass in that day, that the servants of Isaac came and showed him concerning the well which they had digged; and they said unto him, We have found 
waters. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *      33. And he called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.      34. And 
Esau was a son of forty years, and he took for a woman Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.      35. And they were bitterness of spirit to Isaac and 
to Rebekah.

The reason 'a quake' means an alteration of state is that a quake occurs within the space-time continuum, and in the next life there is no concept of space and time, but instead of these the concept 
of state. In the next life it does indeed appear as though all things exist within space and follow one another in a time-sequence, but in themselves they are alterations of state, for space and time 
there are the products of these. This is very well known to all spirits, even evil ones, who by means of alterations of state effected in others cause them to appear somewhere other than where they in 
fact are. Man too is able to know of this from the fact that insofar as his state is one of affection and therefore of joy, or insofar as it is one of thought and therefore of withdrawal from the body, 
he is outside time. For while such a state lasts, many hours seem to him to be as scarcely one hour. The reason for this is that states belong to his internal man, which is his spirit, to which states 
intervals of space and periods of time in the external man correspond. 'A quake' therefore, being one of the consecutive events that occur within space and time, in the internal sense means an alteration 
of state </p>

Quod `motus' sit status mutatio est inde quia motus fit in spatio et in tempore; et in litera vita nulla idea spatii et temporis est, sed loco eorum est status; in altera vita quidem apparent omnia 
sicut in spatio, et succedunt sicut in tempore, sed in se sunt status mutationes, nam inde illa; hoc notissimum est unicuique spiritui, etiam malis, qui per status mutationes aliis inductas faciunt ut 
appareant alibi, cum tamen (t)ibi non sunt; etiam homini potest notum esse ex eo quod quantum homo est in statu affectionum et inde gaudii, et quantum in statu cogitationum et inde absentiae a corpore, 
tantum non sit in tempore, nam plures horae tunc apparent ei vix ut una; et hoc ex causa quia ejus interno homini seu spiritui sunt status, quibus spatia et tempora in externo correspondent; `motus'

<p>          CAPUT XXVI </p>
<p>1.  Et fuit fames in terra, praeter famem priorem quae fuit in diebus Abrahami; 
et ivit Jishak ad Abimelechum regem Philistaeorum, Gerarem. 2.  Et apparuit ad illum JEHOVAH, et dixit, Ne descendas Aegyptum, reside in terra quam dico ad te. 3.  Peregrinare in terra hac, et 
ero cum te, et benedicam tibi, quia tibi et semini tuo dabo omnes terras has, et erigam juramentum quod juravi Abrahamo patri tuo. 4.  Et multiplicari faciam semen tuum, sicut stellas caelorum, et dabo 
semini tuo omnes terras has; et benedicentur in semine tuo omnes gentes terrae. 5.  Propterea quod auscultavit Abraham voci Meae, et observavit observanda Mea, praecepta Mea, statuta Mea, et leges 
Meas. 6.  Et habitabat Jishak in Gerar. 7.  Et interrogaverunt viri loci ad mulierem ejus; et dixit, Soror mea illa, quia timuit dicere, Mulier mea; forte occidant me viri loci propter Rebeccam, quia 
bona aspectu illa. 8.  Et factum, quia prolongabantur ei ibi dies, et prospexit Abimelech rex Philistaeorum trans fenestram, et vidit, et ecce Jishak ridens cum Rebecca muliere sua. 9.  Et vocabat 
Abimelech Jishakum, et dixit, Atqui ecce mulier tua illa, et quomodo dixisti, Soror mea illa? et dixit ad illum Jishak, Quia dixi, Forte moriar propter illam. 10.  Et dixit Abimelech, Quid hoc fecisti 
nobis? ut parum cubaret unus populi cum muliere tua, et adduxisses super nos reatum. 11.  Et praecepit Abimelech omni populo, dicendo, Tangens virum illum et mulierem ejus, moriendo morietur. 12. 
 Et seminavit Jishak in terra illa, et invenit in anno illo centum mensuras; et benedixit ei JEHOVAH. 13.  Et crevit vir, et ivit eundo et crescendo, usque ut magnus factus valde. 14.  Et fuit ei 
acquisitio gregis, et acquisitio armenti, et servitium multum; et invidebant ei Philistaei. 15.  Et omnes puteos, quos foderunt servi patris ejus, in diebus Abrahami patris ejus, obturabant illos Philistaei, 
et impleverunt illos pulvere. 16.  Et dixit Abimelech ad Jishakum, Vade a cum nobis, quia praevales prae nobis valde. 17.  Et ivit abinde Jishak, et castrametatus est in valle Geraris, et 
habitabat ibi. 18.  Et redibat Jishak, et refodit puteos aquarum, quos foderunt in diebus Abrahami patris ejus, et obturabant illos Philistaei post mortem Abrahami; et vocavit illis nomina, secundum 
nomina, quae vocavit illis pater ejus. 19.  Et foderunt servi Jishaki in valle, et invenerunt ibi puteum aquarum vivarum. 20.  Et rixati sunt pastores Geraris cum pastoribus Jishaki, dicendo, Nobis 
aquae; et vocavit nomen putei Esek, quia contenderunt cum eo. 21.  Et foderunt puteum alium, et rixati etiam super illo, et vocavit nomen illius Sitnah. 22.  Et transtulit exinde, et fodit puteum alium, 
et non rixati super illo, et vocavit nomen ejus Rehoboth, et dixit, Quia nunc dilatari facit Jehovah nos, et fructificabimur in terra. 23.  Et ascendit exinde Beershebam. 24.  Et apparuit ad eum 
JEHOVAH in nocte illa, et dixit, Ego DEUS Abrahami patris tui, ne timeas, quia cum te Ego, et benedicam tibi, et multiplicari faciam semen tuum, propter Abrahamum servum Meum. 25.  Et aedificabat ibi 
altare, et invocavit nomen Jehovae, et tetendit ibi tentorium suum; et perfoderunt ibi servi Jishaki puteum. 26.  Et Abimelech ivit ad illum e Gerar, et Ahuzzath socius illius, et Phichol dux exercitus 
illius. 27.  Et dixit ad illos Jishak, Quapropter venistis ad me, et vos odistis me, et misistis me a vobis? 28.  Et dixerunt, Videndo vidimus, quod fuit JEHOVAH cum te, et diximus, Sit quaeso 
sacramentum inter nos, inter nos et inter te, et excidamus foedus cum te. 29.  Si facias cum nobis malum, quemadmodum non tetigimus te, et quemadmodum fecimus cum te tantummodo bonum, et misimus te 
in pace; tu nunc benedictus JEHOVAE. 30.  Et fecit illis convivium, et ederunt et biberunt. 31.  Et mane surrexerunt in matutino, et juraverunt vir fratri suo; et misit eos Jishak, et iverunt a cum 
illo in pace. 32.  Et fuit in die illo, et venerunt servi Jishaki, et indicaverunt ei super causas putei quem foderunt; et dixerunt ei, Invenimus aquas. 33.  Et vocavit eum Shiba, propterea nomen urbis 
Beersheba usque ad diem hunc.                *             *               *             * 34.  Et fuit Esau filius quadraginta annorum, et accepit mulierem Jehudith, filiam Beeri Hittaei, et Basemath 
filiam Elonis Hittaei. 35.  Et fuerunt amaritudo spiritus Jishako et Rebeccae. </p>
