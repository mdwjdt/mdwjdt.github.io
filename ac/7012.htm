<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7012节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7012.</strong>“好行神迹”表随后的启示和对真理的确证。这从“神迹”的含义清楚可知，“神迹”是指对真理的确证（参看<a href="6870.htm">6870</a>节）。它也表示启示，是因为对真理的确证通过当人以认识真理为目的而研究圣言时从主所获得的启示实现。至于启示和随后对真理的确证，要知道，那些处于没有一个内在的外在之人，如犹太人和以色列人，不可能有启示，也可能有对真理的任何确证；而当那些处于外在，同时也处于内在的人阅读圣言时，他们就会获得启示，并在这启示中看见真理，之后他们会一遍又一遍地确证这些真理。说来奇妙，各人所受启示的性质取决于他对真理的情感的性质；他对真理的情感的性质又取决于其生活的良善。这也解释了为何那些只为自己的利益，而不是为了真理的缘故而拥有对真理的情感之人在阅读圣言时，根本得不到任何启示。相反，他们为自己确证教义，无论它们是什么样的教义，是如异端邪说那样是虚假的，还是如犹太人的教义那样完全违背真理，因为他们寻求的，不是主的国，而是世界，不是信仰，而是名声，因而不是天上的财富，只是地上的财富；即便从圣言认识真理的渴望真的临到他们身上，虚假也会取代真理出现，最终出现的是对所有真理的否认。说这些事是为了叫人们知道何为启示和随后对真理的确证。</p>

Wherewith thou shalt do the signs. That this signifies the consequent enlightenment and confirmation of truths, is evident from the signification of a "sign," as being the confirmation of truths (see 
n. 6870); that it also denotes enlightenment, is because the confirmation of truths is effected by means of enlightenment from the Lord when a man studies the Word with the end of knowing truths. As 
regards enlightenment and the consequent confirmation of truths, be it known that they who are in externals without an internal (as were the Jews and the Israelites) cannot be enlightened; thus neither 
can they be confirmed in truths, whereas when they who are in externals and at the same time in internals read the Word, they are enlightened, and in their enlightenment see truths, in which they are 
afterward more and more confirmed; and, wonderful to say, everyone has such enlightenment as is his affection of truth; and such affection of truth as is his good of life. Hence also it is that they 
who are in no affection of truth for the sake of truth, but for the sake of their own advantage, are not at all enlightened when they read the Word, but are only confirmed in doctrinal things, no matter 
of what kind, whether false, as heresies are, or entirely contrary to truths, as are the Jewish ones; for they do not seek the kingdom of the Lord, but the world; not faith, but fame; thus not heavenly 
riches, but only earthly; and if perchance they are seized with a desire of knowing truths from the Word, falsities present themselves instead of truths, and at last there is denial of all things. 
These things have been said in order that it may be known what enlightenment is, and the consequent confirmation of truth. </p>

'With which you shall do the signs' means consequent enlightenment and corroboration of truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'sign as the corroboration of truths, dealt with in <a href="6870.htm">6870</a> The reason why 
enlightenment is also meant is that the corroboration of truths comes about through enlightenment received from the Lord when a person focuses his attention on the Word to the end that he may have 
a knowledge of truths. As regards enlightenment and a resulting corroboration of truths, it should be recognized that no enlightenment nor thus any corroboration of truths is possible with those who are 
interested, as the Jews and Israelites were, only in things of an external nature and not in anything internal. But when those who are interested in external things and at the same time in internal 
ones read the Word they receive enlightenment, and with that enlightenment they see truths, which after that are corroborated for them over and over again. And what is so amazing, the nature of each 
person's enlightenment is determined by the nature of his affection for truth, and the nature of his affection for truth is determined by the good present in his life. This also goes to explain why those 
who have no affection for truth for its own sake, only for the sake of gain, receive no enlightenment at all when they read the Word. Instead they merely corroborate for themselves matters of doctrine 
whatever they may be, whether they are false, as heretical teachings are, or entirely contrary to truths, as the teachings of the Jews are, since they do not seek the Lord's kingdom but the world, 
not faith but renown, thus not heavenly riches but merely earthly ones. Or if a desire to know truths from the Word does perhaps descend on them, falsities present themselves instead of truths, and 
at length denial of all truths. These matters have been stated in order that people may know what enlightenment is, and a resulting corroboration of truth. </p>

`Quo facies signa': quod significet inde illustrationem et confirmationem veritatum, constat ex significatione `signi' quod sit confirmatio veritatum, de qua n. 6870; quod quoque sit illustratio, est 
quia confirmatio veritatum fit per illustrationem a Domino cum homo Verbo studet fine sciendi vera.  Quod illustrationem attinet et inde confirmationem veritatum, sciendum quod illi qui in externis 
absque interno sunt, ut fuerunt Judaei et Israelitae, non possint illustrari, ita nec confirmari in veris; at qui in externis sunt et simul in internis, {1} cum legunt Verbum, illustrantur, et in illustratione 
vident vera, in quibus postea magis et magis confirmantur; et quod mirum, talis unicuique est illustratio qualis ei affectio veri est, et talis affectio veri quale bonum vitae; inde quoque est 
quod qui in nulla affectione veri sunt propter verum, sed propter lucra, prorsus non illustrentur cum legunt Verbum, sed modo confirmantur in doctrinalibus qualiacumque sint, sive falsa, ut sunt haeretica, 
sive prorsus contraria veris, ut sunt Judaica, nam {2}regnum Domini non quaerunt sed mundum, non fidem sed famam, ita non divitias caelestes sed modo terrestres; {3}sique illis forte incidit 
cupido sciendi vera ex Verbo, offerunt se falsa loco verorum, et tandem negatio omnium; haec dicta sunt ut sciatur quid illustratio, et inde confirmatio veri. 	@1 i illi$ 	@2 fidem non quaerunt$ 	@3
