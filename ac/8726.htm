<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8726节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8726.</strong>“立他们为百姓的首领”表进入这些真理的流注。这从有才能的人和“立他们作首领”的含义，以及摩西的代表清楚可知：有才能的人，即此处那些被摩西立为百姓首领的人，是指能与良善联结的真理，如刚才所述（<a href="8725.htm">8725</a>节）；摩西是指直接从神发出的真理，如前面频繁所述；“立他们作首领”是指流入，因而是指赋予品质给这些真理，好叫直接从神来的真理能经由它们通过良善引导教会成员。至于这一切是怎么回事，这可从前面所给出的解释看出来，即：正在重生的人一开始通过系信之真理的真理被引导；但当已经重生时，他就通过系仁之良善的良善被引导（<a href="8643.htm">8643</a>，<a href="8648.htm">8648</a>，<a href="8658.htm">8658</a>，<a href="8685.htm">8685</a>，<a href="8690.htm">8690</a>，<a href="8701.htm">8701</a>节）。在第一种状态下，即当他通过真理被引导时，主通过直接从祂发出的神之真理流入；但在第二种状态下，即当他通过良善被引导时，主通过既直接，又间接从祂发出的真理流入（<a href="8685.htm">8685</a>，<a href="8701.htm">8701</a>节）。间接流注和直接流注一样来自主（<a href="8717.htm">8717</a>节）。这些就是本节在内义上所描述的事。间接来自神的真理的实际流注由“摩西立他们为百姓的首领”这句话来表示。</p>

And gave them as heads over the people. That this signifies influx into these truths, is evident from the signification of "men of strenuousness," who here are those whom he made heads over the people, 
as being truths with which good can be conjoined (of which just above, n. 8725); from the representation of Moses, as being the truth immediately from the Divine (of which frequently above); and from 
the signification of "giving them as heads," as being to flow in, and thus to give quality to, in order that the truth immediately from the Divine may through them lead the man of the church by means 
of good. How this is, can be seen from what has been before set forth, namely, that the man who is being regenerated is at first led by means of the truth which is of faith; but when he has been regenerated 
he is led by means of the good which is of charity (n. 8643, 8648, 8658, 8685, 8690, 8701); and that in the first state, namely, when he is led by means of truth, the Lord flows in through the 
truth Divine which proceeds immediately from Him; but in the other state, namely, when he is led by means of good, the Lord flows in through both the truth which proceeds immediately, and that which 
proceeds mediately, from Him (n. 8685, 8701); and that the mediate influx is equally from the Lord as is the immediate (n. 8717). These are the things described in this verse in the internal sense. 
The very mediate influx of truth from the Divine is signified by the words, "Moses gave them as heads over the people." </p>

'And made them heads over the people' means influx into those truths. This is clear from the meaning of the men of vigour, referred to here as those whom Moses made heads over the people, as truths to 
which good can be joined, dealt with immediately above in <a href="8725.htm">8725</a>; from the representation of Moses as the truth going forth directly from God, dealt with often; and from the meaning of 'making them heads' 
as inflowing, and so imparting qualities to those truths, in order that the truth directly from God can work through them to lead a member of the Church by means of good. The situation in all this 
may be recognized from the following explanations that have been given before, </p>
<p>A person who is being regenerated is led first by means of truth that is the truth of faith; but when he has been regenerated 
he is led by means of good that is the good of charity, <a href="8643.htm">8643</a>, <a href="8648.htm">8648</a>, <a href="8658.htm">8658</a>, <a href="8685.htm">8685</a>, <a href="8690.htm">8690</a>, <a href="8701.htm">8701</a>. </p>
<p>In the first state, when he is led by means of truth, the Lord flows in by means of God's truth 
that is going forth directly from Himself; but in the second state, when he is led by means of good, the Lord flows in by means of truth that goes forth both directly and indirectly from Him, <a href="8685.htm">8685</a>, <a href="8701.htm">8701</a>. 
Indirect influx comes no less from the Lord than direct influx does, <a href="8717.htm">8717</a>. </p>
<p>These are the matters described by this verse in the internal sense. The actual influx of the truth coming indirectly 
from God is meant by the words 'Moses made them heads over the people'. </p>

`Et dedit illos capita super populum': quod significet influxum in illa vera, constat ex significatione `virorum strenuitatis,' qui hic sunt illi quos `dedit capita super populum,' quod sint vera quibus 
bonum conjungi potest, de qua nunc supra n. 8725; ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit verum immediate a Divino, de qua {1}saepius; et ex significatione `dare illos capita' quod sit influere, et 
sic qualificare, ut verum immediate a Divino per illa possit hominem Ecclesiae ducere per bonum.  Quomodo cum his se habet, constare potest ex illis quae prius exposita sunt, quod nempe homo qui regeneratur 
primum ducatur per verum quod fidei, {2}at cum regeneratus est, ducatur per bonum quod charitatis, n. 8643, 8648, 8658, 8685, 8690, 8701; quodque in primo statu, nempe cum ducitur per verum, 
influat Dominus per verum Divinum quod immediate ab Ipso procedit, at in altero statu, nempe cum ducitur per bonum, influat Dominus per verum quod tam immediate quam quod mediate {3} ab Ipso procedit, 
n. 8685, 8701; et quod influxus mediatus aeque sit a Domino {4}quam influxus immediatus, n. 8717; haec sunt quae in hoc versu {5} in sensu interno describuntur; ipse influxus veri {6}mediate a Divino 
significatur per ea verba, quod `Moscheh dedit illos capita super populum.' 	@1 supra$ 	@2 ac$ 	@3 i per coelum$ 	@4 ac est$ 	@5 i iterum$ 	@6 mediato I, mediatus T$ </p>
