<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9459节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9459.</strong>“叫他们为我献供物来”表将要被代表并且所需要的敬拜的内层事物。这从“供物”的含义清楚可知，“供物”是指敬拜所需的事物，在此是指将要被代表的内层事物。因为收集起来为帐幕、桌子、灯台，以及亚伦的衣服所用的材料，也就是金、银、铜、蓝色、紫色、染过两次的朱红色线、细麻、山羊毛，以及其它许多事物就表示这些内层事物；这从下文所论述的它们的含义明显可知。</p>

And let them take for Me a collection. That hereby are signified the interior things of worship that were to be represented, and that are the things required, is evident from the signification of "a 
collection," as being the things required for worship, here the interior things that were to be represented; for such are signified by the things collected for the tent, for the tables, for the lampstand, 
and also for the garments of Aaron; namely, gold, silver, brass, blue, crimson, scarlet double-dyed, fine linen, goats' wool, and many other things; as is evident from their signification, which 
is treated of in what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9459</b></p><p><b>9459.</b>
'Let them take for Me an offering' means the interior things of worship which were going to be represented, which are the real requirements. This is clear from the meaning of 'an offering' as the requirements 
for worship, at this point the interior things which were going to be represented. For by the materials that were gathered together for the tent, tables, and lampstand, also Aaron's garments, 
that is, by the gold, silver, bronze, violet, purple, twice-dyed scarlet, fine linen, wool of she-goats, and many others, those interior things were meant, as is clear from the meaning of them dealt 
with in paragraphs below.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 9459</b>
</p><b>9459.</b>
`Accipiant Mihi collectam':  quod significet interiora cultus quae repraesentarentur, quae sunt requisita, constat ex significatione `collectae' quod sint requisita ad cultum, hic interiora quae repraesentarentur; 
talia enim per illa quae colligebantur ad tentorium, ad mensas, et ad candelabrum {1}, tum ad vestes Aharonis, quae erant aurum, argentum, aes, hyacinthinum, purpura, coccineum dibaphum, 
linum byssinum, lana caprarum, et plura alia, significantur, ut {2}constat (c)ex significatione eorum, de qua in {3} sequentibus. @1 i ibi$ @2 constare potest$ @3 i mox$ </p>
