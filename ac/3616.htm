<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3616节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3616.</strong>“我便打发人去把你从那里带来”表那时目的就达到了。这从上下文清楚可知；因为当真理与良善一致，并且真理以这种方式向良善臣服，并服从于它时，目的就达到了。雅各与拉班同住的时日结束后，这目的就由以扫跑去迎接雅各，拥抱他，搂着他的颈项，亲吻他，并且两个人就哭了之时的场景来代表（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创33.4.htm">33:4</a>）。因为当目的，也就是结合，实现时，理性层的良善就直接流入属世层的良善，并通过属世层的良善流入属世层的真理，以及经由理性层的真理间接流入属世层的真理，并通过属世层的真理流入属世层的良善（<a href="3573.htm">3573</a>节）。由此明显可知为何代表理性层真理的利百加对代表属世层真理的雅各说，“我便打发人去把你从那里带来”。</p>

And I will send and take thee from thence. That this signifies then the end, is evident from what goes before and from what follows; for the end, which is here signified by "sending and taking thee from 
thence," is when truth is in agreement with good, and thus truth serves in subordination to good; this end, after the tarrying of Jacob with Laban was ended, is represented by Esau when he ran to 
meet Jacob, and embraced him, and fell upon his neck, and kissed him, and they wept (Gen. 33:4); for when the end is, that is, the conjunction, then the good of the rational flows immediately into the 
good of the natural, and through the good into its truth, and also mediately through the truth of the rational into the truth of the natural, and through this into the good therein (n. 3573). From this 
it is evident why it was said by Rebekah, by whom is represented the truth of the rational, to Jacob, by whom is represented the truth of the natural, "I will send and take thee from thence." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3616</b></p><p><b>3616.</b>
'And I send and fetch you from there' means that at that point the end in view has been reached. This is clear from what comes before and after; for the end in view, meant here by 'sending and fetching 
you from there', is reached when truth accords with good, and in that way truth has been made subject to good, and is subservient to it. This end, following Jacob's stay with Laban, is represented 
by the occasion when Esau ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him, and they wept, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2033:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 33:4</a>. For when the end in view, which is conjunction, is reached, the good of the 
rational flows into the good of the natural directly, and through the good of the natural into the truth there, as well as indirectly through the truth of the rational into the truth of the natural, 
and through the truth of the natural into the good there, <a href="3573.htm">3573</a>. From this it is evident why Rebekah, who represents the truth of the rational, said to Jacob, who represents the truth of the natural, 
'I send and fetch you from there'. </p>

`Et mittam et accipiam te exinde': quod significet tunc finem, constat ex illis quae praecedunt et quae sequuntur; finis enim qui hic significatur per `mittere et accipere te exinde,' est cum verum cum 
bono concordat, et sic verum subordinatum bono inservit; hic finis, post exactam commorationem Jacobi apud Labanem, repraesentatur per `Esavum,'      Cum {1}cucurrit obviam Jacobo, et amplexus {2}eum, 
et cecidit      super collum ejus, et osculatus {2}eum, et fleverunt, Gen.      xxxiii 4; </p>
<p>cum enim finis, seu conjunctio, {3}tunc rationalis bonum influit immediate in bonum naturalis, et per 
hoc in verum ejus, et quoque mediate per rationalis verum in verum naturalis, et per hoc in bonum ibi, n. 3573 inde patet cur dictum a Rebecca per quam repraesentatur {4}rationalis veram, ad Jacobum 
per quem repraesentatur naturalis verum, `mittam et accipiam te exinde.' @1 accurrit$ @2 i est$ @3 i quae dicta$ @4 Naturalis I$ </p>
