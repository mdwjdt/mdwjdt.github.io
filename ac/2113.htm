Verse 27. And all the men of his house, he that was born in the house, and he that was bought with silver, from the son that is a stranger, were circumcised with him. "All the men of his house, he that 
was born in the house, and he that was bought with silver," signifies all those who are within the church; "from the son that is a stranger," signifies all who are rational outside the church; "were 
circumcised by him," signifies that they were justified by the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2113</b></p><p><b>2113.</b>
Verse 27 And all the men of his house, he that was born in the house and he that was the purchase of silver, from the son who is a foreigner, were circumcised together with him. </p>
<p>'All the men of his 
house, he that was born in the house and he that was the purchase of silver' means all those at that time inside the Church. 'From the son who is a foreigner' means all who are rational outside the 
Church. 'Were circumcised by him' means that they were made righteous by the Lord. </p>

</p><b>2113.</b>
Vers. 27.  Et omnes viri domus, et natus domus, et emptio argenti, a filio alienigena, circumcisi sunt cum illo. `Omnes viri domus ejus, natus domus, et emptio argenti' significat quod tunc omnes illi 
qui intra Ecclesiam: `a filio alienigena' significat omnes qui rationales extra Ecclesiam: `circumcisi sunt ab {1} illo' significat quod justificati sint a Domino. 	@1 cum A. but evidently altered 
to agree with following a Domino. Heb. [ ] (`eth)= `with' or `in respect of.'  In 2116 A and I have ab illo.$ </p>
